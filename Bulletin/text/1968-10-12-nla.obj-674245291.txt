QUICK SLIPS
AS POLITICIANS tend to be talkative
it is inevitable that there are sometimes
slips. Sir Henry Bolte was talking about
our “foundling fathers” on television
the other night, and the Leader of the
Federal Opposition, Mr. Gough Whit-
lam, was calling, in “The Sydney Morn-
ing Herald,” for “proper urbane
development.”
LAST LAUGH
GEORGE WALLACE, jun.’s, jokebook
was a rich memory bank which could
be progra'mmed to produce a stream of
gags simply by reference to such key
words and phrases as “honeymoon,”
“mother-in-law,” “double bed,” and
“bicycle built for two.” There was
nothing subtle about George’s comedy
line; it derived straight from the age
of vaudeville in which his own career
was rooted. The sad fact about George’s
career was that it began to flower when
vaudeville was withering, and when he
died in Brisbane last week, at the age
of 50, he was a greatly underestimated
comedian, struggling to bridge the time
gap through a medium — television —
which never really sympathetically
came to terms with him or his style of
comedy.
George was the son of a famous
father and he once confided to friends
that having to play George Wallace,
jun. to the reputation of George Wal-
lace, sen., was his greatest professional
disadvantage. “I’ve never really felt
that I’ve got out of Dad’s shadow,” he
said. “If they can remember George
Wallace, sen., they say, ‘Oh, young
George isn’t as good as his Dad,’ and
if they didn’t know Dad they get con-
fused by my junior tag.” He and his
father were not close, but a few years
after George, sen., died, young George
told friends that his father’s contribu-
tion to Australian comedy was already
in danger of being forgotten. He dis-
cussed a book about the Wallace
family with several journalists, but the
project never matured.
George, jun., was born at Mackay at
a time when his mother and father
were both starring in touring shows.
When he was three they introduced
him to the stage in a comedy sketch
and he was reared on black-out
sketches, funny hats, and falling
trousers. He didn’t significantly strike
out on his own until after World War
II, when he toured Australia and New
Zealand with a show called “Kanga-
roosters.” It was booked into Brisbane’s
bygone Theatre Royal for a short
season in 1948 and George stayed on
there as resident comic until the
theatre closed in 1958. He then
attempted to convey his “typical
Aussie” act to audiences in southern
States, but the sophisticated competition
of American television comedy was too
great. In 1961 he was back in Bris-
bane, where BTQ Channel 7 revived
the Theatre Royal genre as a weekly
comedy show with George as its resi-
dent star.
“Theatre Royal” is one of the longest
running Australian comedy-variety
shows still on television* but after seven
years it became a nervous agony for
George. Plagued by recurrent ill-
nesses, unable to find suitable writers
who understood his style, and over-
whelmed by the relentless voracity of
television, he began to lose his
characteristic optimism.
Among the high stools and super-
ficial subtleties of modern comedy,
George’s knockabout brand was some-
times uneasily anachronistic. Yet the
comparison always overlooked George’s
superb sense of timing, the rich
risibility of his astonished face in close-
up, and the depth of a genuinely Aus-
tralian humorous style.
DISCOVERING AN ANCESTOR
NEW GUINEA’S Owen Stanley Range
achieved its slice of historic significance
during the jungle fighting of World
War II, but the British naval officer
who gave the mountain range his name
a century before has largely been by-
passed by history.
In a biography just published by
Heinemann, Adelaide Lubbock, a
descendant of Owen Stanley, has sifted
his story out of obscurity with the help
of family papers and some sparse
reminders of him and his expeditions
in archives here and in England. The
result is an ironic study of an ambitious
man inevitably prone to missing life’s
most important boats before dying of
an epileptic seizure at 38.
Adelaide Lubbock, in Australia for
the launching of the book, told us in
Sydney last week that she first thought
of writing Stanley’s biography on a
previous trip to Sydney several years
ago. “I hadn’t even heard of the
Kokoda Trail then. Can you imagine
it?”
The fact that he was an ancestor
interested her, and she spent two years
on spasmodic attempts to research his
life in libraries both here and in Eng-
land before her mother unwittingly
presented her with the material which
Adelaide Lubbock...opening the
black box
was to form the core of the book. “I
suppose I had the main events in his
life. But they were all contained in
official documents,” she remembers.
“There was no clue to what he was
like.”
Her mother’s contribution to her
research was a black box which she
had never opened, but which was
thought to contain old family letters.
And it did a large store of undated
correspondence written by Owen Stan-
ley and his relatives.
“The Stanleys have always loved
gossip they still do. In those days,
they wrote one another notes on just
about everything. They were very artic-
ulate, and a lot of it was about Owen,,
whom they didn’t really like very
much. I’ve tried to set his life against
this extraordinary, rather violent and
radical-minded family.”
The task of dating the letters was a
vast job, accomplished painstakingly
by checking the contents of each one
against the events of Stanley’s life as
she already knew them from the docu-
ments. She estimates she spent five
years on research, some of her material
emanating from totally unexpected
sources.
“I first read of Owen’s last love
affair with a very plain girl of
17, who hero-worshipped him in a
book written by a Cambridge don

called Owen Chadwick. And I wrote
to him, asking him to let me know
who I could contact to find out more.
He wrote back, telling me to get in
touch with Lady Harrod, because
Ama, the girl, had been her great-
grandmother. Lady Harrod has been
a friend of mine since childhood, and
I had no idea of this connection. Any-
way, she was able to give me a lot
more letters.”
Some of her detective work was not
so successful. As Stanley died before
he could marry his Ama (she later
'married a Quaker clergyman), he had
no direct descendants, and many of
his possessions have disappeared,
among them his portrait. So the book
has no picture of him.
Mrs. Lubbock is the daughter of
the 5th Lord Stanley of Alderley who
was Governor of Victoria between
1914 and 1919, and she spent part
of her childhood in Australia, the rest
in the large family home at Alderley,
where Owen Stanley also grew up.
“It’s been pulled down now — and
the land sold to ICI. It was an enor-
mous house, and in the ’twenties and
’thirties the life of a country gentle-
man wasn’t everybody’s choice, so my
brother sold it. It had about 50 bed-
rooms — and I can even remember
the day the telephone was put in.
Only my grandmother was allowed
to use that.”
Her next book will probably be an
autobiography, although at present
she’s apprehensive about it. “It seems
so much easier to write about some-
one else somehow. But I suppose I’ll
try it.”
FINANCIAL GAP
PERTH WOMAN Mrs. Margaret
Blackburn, a former teacher now with
two children at university, has just pre-
pared a careful case to warn parents
of the financial gap between Common-
wealth Scholarships and the cost of
tertiary education. The scheme, she
points out, pays all compulsory fees
but not for books. The scholarship
holder gets $559 at home, or up to
$904.80 if living away from home.
However, this allowance, Mrs. Black-
bum points out, is contingent on “the
adjusted family income of the students’
parents not exceeding $2300.” The
adjustment is made by deducting from
the parents’ combined gross income
$300 for each dependent child, other
than the scholar, under the age of 16,
or for each full-time scholar under 21.
“You must agree,” she comments “that
the figure spells poverty.”
“If there are two or more students
on a living allowance,” says Mrs. Black-
burn, “the second and third will have
their allowance reduced when the eldest
turns 21. Subsequently the eldest will
have his allowance reduced as each of
the others turn 21, although parents
could still be supporting all of them.”
It is the magical age of 21 that throws
many parents, Mrs. Blackburn says.
“They believe that at 21 the student will
become an individual in his own right,
that from that time onward the means
test will be applied to his income. This
is not so. The combined gross income
of the parents is still used for the means
test, until the student reaches 25 or
marries. He is then entitled to a mature-
age allowance or a married student’s
allowance.”
Only a limited number of faculties
turn out graduates under 21, and for
the rest there are problems. Student
endowment ceases at 21. The student
stops being a taxation dependant, and
unless he is on a cadetship his costs
can no longer be deducted for tax
purposes. These same costs can’t be
claimed by the student, either, although
he pays the same taxation as all workers.
On the less officially inhibiting level,
it is a fact also that books become more
expensive at this age, social life more
demanding and costly, and often
although the oldies will scoff a car
becomes a positive necessity.

THE LONG WALK
BACK GETS
EVEN LONGER
WHAT THE “GUARDIAN” in
London described recently “as the vast
gladiatorial arena” is now complete. If
you like to look at Melburnian Chris-
tians being eaten by lions, the capacity
of the MCG is now 124,000. The back-
room comforts of the new Western
Stand are something to see. The new
members’ bar has black vinyl club-like
armchairs, wall-to-wall carpet with the
MCG insignia, and panelled walls and
ceiling. The dining-room and ladies’
bar are equally as grand. There are
closed-circuit TV screens focused on
the scoreboard, so that one can keep
track of the score at all times. One
might ask: “Why not a TV view of the
game?” However, there is an official
altruistic view that members should be
encouraged to look at sport occasion-
ally. Our school prefects used to have
the same idea.
The players’ rooms now have a
parquet floor, like the most salubrious
banks, and they are all air-conditioned.
just like the offices of the best man-
aging directors. There is just one little
handicap. Stan Evans, the architect, has
paced out the distance from the
dressing-roo'ms to the crease and he
estimated that a batsman will now walk
as far as from the Flinders Street
Station to the GPO.
This could be a long walk after
scoring a duck with, say, 90,000 pairs
of eyes looking and not a single
handclap.
There is one little insight on well-
behaved Melbourne. First-class cricket
on Sundays will be played at the MCG
during the coming season. However, no
liquor will be served in those lovely new

members’ bars during Sunday ’matches.
Nor will they be able to take cans into
licensed areas. But it seems likely non-
members will be able to take cans into
the outer. How could you ever stop
them? As the “Herald” reported,
parched members will be hopping the
fence for a drink with the hoi polloi.
Your correspondent dutifully went
along to the Grand Final between Carl-
ton and Essendon, and sought out a
bird’s-eye view in the scoreboard. This
scoreboard had to be shifted to make
way for the new stand, so that now it
is poised more than 10 storeys above
the ground. The scorer, Joe Kinnear,
gave the invitation to climb up on
the scoreboard’s galvanised iron roof-
for the official unfurling of the Aus-
tralian flag. Frankly, it was a little
unnerving. On one side there is a view
straight down, 200 ft. or more to Brun-
ton Avenue. And one had to be careful
not to step backward or one was likely
to drop to the footpath and squash a
gentleman selling cupie dolls of Ron
Barassi. On the other side there was
an aerial view of the biggest football
crowd in Australia’s history, an unbe-
lievable colosseum of faces, and, as
the “Guardian” suggested, one won-
dered what awful event would take
place if they all decided to turn thumbs
down.
The wind was howling at 20 to 30
knots and, as we shivered up there,
Mr. Kinnear explained that at 2.30
p.m., when the teams were lined up on
the ground, the RAAF band would play
“God Save the Queen.” At the very
first bar it was his job to break out
the flag.
We did not hear more than the first
few bars. There was this fantastic
noise some booing, some cheering,
116,828 voices calling for action and
it rose, a tremendous organ of sound.
But it wasn’t only that. It is traditional
at this mystic Melburnian moment to
heave as much paper as possible into
the air, streamers, chopped-up compu-
ter tapes, torn-up telephone books, any-
thing. So with the north wind howling
at such a rate all this hit the front of
the scoreboard and the huge updraft
went past our noses, with the streamers,
balloons, bits of computer tape, going
up, up, up, hundreds of feet. The paper
looked rather pretty sparkling in the
sun.
We went down into the comfort
of the scoreboard. There they have a
refrigerator, telephone, and even a
shower. I turned on the shower, but it
didn’t work; what with the vast flush-
ing of lavatories for 116,828, no water
was getting up to the scoreboard. If
scorers wish to wash they have to
wait for .minor matches of only 20,000.
But what happened to that crowd of
124,000 that we had expected? The
ground was big enough to take them
with comfort. Well, despite the fact
that scalpers were getting up to $35
a ticket, between 4500 and 5000 ticket-
holders failed to turn up. The secretary,
lan Johnson, said this happened every
year. Ticket-holders whose teams failed
to get into the Grand Final did not

turn up. Furthermore, the Members
Stand could have taken another 3000.
Despite the record crowds in the
finals, over 100,000 for every match,
it was not a good season. Attendances,
which have been dropping since 1963,
were down again a total week’s
attendance at all matches was usually
around 110,000, when in good years it
is 170,000 or 200,000.
Dr. lan Turner, a Senior Lecturer
in Monash, author of “Syd-
ney’s Burning,” is writing a social
history of Australian Rules football. It
will be a noble effort to explain why
Victorians went crazy about this game,
why it built such large crowds. He will
recall the old days when football was
such a regional thing, the clashes be-
tween the working-class suburbs. When
Smith Street on a Saturday night was
in a state of war, Collingwood
supporters one side, Fitzroy men the
other. Then there was traditional hatred
between working-class Collingwood
and Melbourne, the toffs.
He believes that the Victorian Foot-
ball League should now make a care-
ful market survey to discover what is
going wrong. The 'motor-car, the
affluent society, which has hurt all
spectator sports, has something to do
with it. However, just as a personal
observation, with no reliable statistical
evidence, Dr. Turner suggests that foot-
ball is losing the 18- to 25-year-old
group. Oh, yes, from ten to 16 there
are plenty, but then they seejn to be-
come bored and look for fun else-
where. The older people still go.
As an older person and a resident
of Lennon St., Richmond, Dr. Turner
shows an old-fashioned devotion to
Richmond. So, indeed, do the news-
papers. Over a few beers lan Turner
and some friends created a song com-
posed entirely of newspaper headlines.

A NIGHT OF
ORGANISED
MADNESS
THERE HAS BEEN altogether too
much mental drama for the Junoesque
committee member now leaning against
a table of dirty glasses, and if she
jiggles once more there will be a drama
of a totally different nature. What she
wants is to go home, where is that
damn’d husband of hers?
It is around 11 p.m. and the occasion
is a charity night held at the Queen
Mary Nurses’ Home, Camperdown, in
aid of what everyone calls nurses’
amenities, but what in fact is a
swimming-pool for the girls. For some
reason it is thought a little—how can
one committee member put it? a
little indiscreet to say swimming-pool.
You know, people get the wrong idea.
Implying that something like a new
lavatory or a laundry or a canteen,
which assists nurses to work even
harder, is all right, but to give the im-
pression they’re entitled to some fun is
all wrong. Although Nola Dekyvere,
who is president of the Royal Prince
Alfred Hospital and King George V
Appeals Committee, does say it’s mar-
vellous of everyone to help give the
nurses fun, while at the same time add-
ing she had absolutely nothing to do
with it. Mrs. Shirley Wall and her
wonderful sub-com'mittee have done it
all on their own. Well, everyone knows
Nola. She just hears Mrs. Wall say
wouldn’t it be a good idea to get a stage
show going, something everyone will
want to come and see, even husbands, a
charity night with a difference, and


PAPUA A All NEW GUINEA DEVELOPMENT DANK
POUT MORESBY
DEPUTY
MANAGING DIRECTOR
A Deputy Managing Director is being sought
for the Papua and New Guinea Development
Bank.
The Bank was established in 1966, its main
functions being to provide finance for
development in the Territory, particularly
the development of small undertakings by
indigenous entrepreneurs or farmers.
The Bank also provides technical advice and
assistance to promote primary production
and industrial commercial undertakings.
The Bank considers primarily the prospects
of the operations financed being successful
and does not necessarily have prime regard to
the value of security available in respect to
such finance.
The prospective appointee should have a
broad financial and investment experience
and a knowledge of development problems
and development finance. He is not necessarily
required to have a banking background.
A salary of $10,500 is offered, plus an enter-
tainment allowance of $6OO per annum.
Additional benefits are low income tax, fur-
nished married or single accommodation at
nominal rent, 3 months’ leave after 21
months’ service, with assisted leave fares to
Australia and a secondary school allowance
for children studying in Australia.
Appointment would he for a period of two
years in the first instance or by negotiation
for a longer period.
Applications giving details of age, qualifica-
tions and experience will he treated as strictly
confidential and should reach the Secretary,
Department of External Territories, Can-
berra, A.C.T., by 26tli October.
Nola says yes, get on with it, Shirley.
So here everybody is, reluctant hus-
bands and all, 250 at $lO each (inclu-
sive). Which is esoteric charity language
for liquor is provided but, by heck,
they’d better lay out for the raffle.
Which tonight includes some heady
prizes of the champagne/whisky ilk
interspersed with joky items like bags
of jelly babies and onions.
At 7 p.m. .the nurses’ s'moking-room
is violated with fun-seeking husbands
and wives. “. . . darling, you came ..
Large breasts are crushed against the
emaciated frame of a little man in
spectacles. The full bohemian bit. Here
in Camperdown. The little man looks
like he wants to die. And S over
there is casting a lustful eye around the
nurses who are serving drinks and ten
minutes later says OK, he’s chosen.
That’s the one. Wouldn’t P agree?
Later he slaps a pocket. In there are
the details. A committee member stands
by a dividing door bleating how is she
to tell everyone dinner is served? On
account of the noise. A man who is
big in something or other no one
seems to know quite what it is says
he plays in Sydney and works in Wol-
longong and doesn’t know a soul here.
There are rather more doctors than,
say, lawyers, and there is a mean tycoon
who won’t part with a penny for the
P and C committee, and conversation
Is of the cervical/appendix/gynaecolo-
gical genre. The Wollongong player
thinks it time—um—he got back to his
party, who by now will be missing him.
The committee member doesn’t need to
announce dinner. They sense it and melt
through to the nurses’ ballroom in,
what is becoming obvious in some cases,
an alcoholic haze. There are some girls
who will insist on mixing their pills
with their liquor and then, darl, have
the nerve to blame their doctors. Too
bad. So in to dinner, done by the
hospital: chicken and rice served in
those tinfoil cases which no one knows
where to put. And over these intimate
tables . . .
“. . . who cares about food so long
as the wine flows . . .”
“. . . if she writes a line about me
I’ll sue . .
“. . . I want X (a well-known obstet-
rician) to give her a baby . . .”
Mrs. Wall’s stage show is called
“Spring Fever,” or, a night of madness
with Stuart Wagstaff, Ron Frazer, the
Boy Friend cast, and the Doncaster
Theatre Restaurant showgirls, and in
the nurses’ library, which tonight is a
dressing-room, Ron Frazer, with a hos-
pital screen around him, is saying he
feels exhausted. Well, he’s just come
from a heavy lunch on one of those
Italian liners. Stuart Wagstaff is tying
Ron’s white satin matelot’s bow and
announces that he, Wagstaff, is going
on as himself. Would anyone care for
a whisky? And Andonia Katsaros sits
with her hair teased a foot high. The
show is terrible. What worries Ron
Frazer, who does his last scene from
Mrs. Nola Dekyvere and actor Run
Frazer doing their Lambeth Walk
“What A Thing To Say,” is it might
do harm to that. However, the show-
girls go down well, and the wives say
look at their husbands, they’re loving
it. Put them, the wives that is, in high-
cut all-in-ones and they’d look sexy,,
too. They say. Local film producer
Donald Wynne, who is becoming
noticeably more extrovert on these occa-
sions, hitches his trousers and Hands-
Knees-and-Boomps with Miss Katsaros,
and Nola comes on and does the Lam-
beth Walk or something with Ron
Frazer. And then says her piece, men-
tioning en passant the sadness of selling

THE GLORY THAT
WAS DE
MPEBERLU CHILLMPILLUS
HAVE YOU SEEN Mpomp Santers or
Ntita Komp lately? You possibly have,
as they are the television personalities
Bob Sanders and Dita Cobb. That is
how their names are spelled in the TV
programs printed in Australia’s Greek-
language newspapers. Or rather, that is
how they are spelled if you turn the
Greek letters into the corresponding
ones of our alphabet.
Some old acquaintances of the TV
screen are easy enough to recognise in
their Hellenic form, like Souperman
and De Phlintstons. The Australian
actor Tsips Raphertu presents only
minor difficulty. But others are heavily
disguised. John Bailey’s closest rela-
tions might not know him as Tzon
Mpaielu; and Chentu Entu is a long
way from Handy Andy. Among the
few performers whose names are
spelled in Greek without any change
are Rex Mossop and Peter Sellers.
There are three bi-weekly Greek-
language newspapers in Australia, each
of which claims to have the largest cir-
culation. Both - Sydney’s “Hellenic
Herald,” and Melbourne’s “New
World” strongly oppose the present
military government of Greece; the
Sydney tabloid “New Country” does
not. But my slight knowledge of the
language does not qualify me to
analyse these papers’ politics. My
studies have been limited to their tele-
vision programs.
The main reason why the names in
them look strange is the conservatism
of Greek spelling. This has been kept,
for patriotic reasons, as close as pos-
sible to what it was in the glorious days
of Aristotle and Co. But pronunciation
has changed a great deal in the mean-
time.
For one thing, the Greek letter “b”
is pronounced now like our “v,” while
their “mp” sounds like our “b.” Hence
English “Bob” when spelled phoneti-
cally in Greek becomes “Mpo,mp.” Also
the Greek “d” is pronounced like our
“th,” and their “nt” like our “d.” So
Dita appears in her Grecian guise as
Ntita.
It is a fine old mix-up. Add various
other differences between the Greek
and English ways of representing
sounds, such as their “ou” for our “w”
and “ch” for our “h.” The process of
turning an English word into the
Greek alphabet that is, transliter-
ating while keeping approximately
the same sound can result in such
notable oddities as De Mpeberlu
Chillmpillus (The Beverly Hillbillies)
or Mplontu ent Ntagkount (Blondie
and Dagwood).
The hard-pressed journalists who
compile Greek TV programs have to
decide whether to translate the title of
a show or transliterate it. A translation
generally has more dignity. Thus “The
Great Lover,” starring Bob Hope, is
translated O Megalos Erastes, which
has a fine classical sound; but the star’s
name appears as Mpomp Chop.
Different newspapers may treat the
same title in different ways. “New
Country” translates “Bewitched” as E
Magissa (The Witch), whereas the
“Hellenic Herald” transliterates it to
Mpeouitst. In this case the translation
is definitely more attractive. Magissa,
with its suggestion of magic combined
with femininity, is a very nice word for
a witch.
Sometimes the same newspaper uses
both methods. In reporting the arrival
of the Monkees, “New World” trans-
lated them to the Pithekoi; yet its
TV programs referred to them as De
Monkis.
Translated titles may derive a
peculiar flavor from the fact that the
same word means different things in
Greek and English. An example is the
session which is seemingly called
“Esoteric News.” It puzzled me until
I learned that the Greek esoterikos
means “internal.”
The rewarding feature of Greek TV
programs is that they give familiar
items a fresh, interesting look. Tonight
shall I watch the serial Mpellmpert?
Or perhaps De Ent Salliban Soou? No,
I think I shall look at the amateurs
on Niou Phaiesis, or the variety hour
compered by Gkornton Tsater.
I know that these words and names
have only a ghostly, abstract kind of
existence. They are the illegitimate
result of a double transliteration first
phonetically from English to Greek,
then unphonetically from Greek back
to English. And yet they exert a cer-
tain charm. Some day one may hope
to catch an old movie in which Mping
Krosmpu sings “Ouen de rent, rent
rompin kams mpomp, mpomp, mpom-
pin along.”

Comment by ‘Observer’
LEARNING TO BE OUT OF DATE
SINCE MOST OF the faults of edu-
cation in Australia come from its
imitations of British education sys-
tems, when the British begin criticising
their own systems, as they have now
been doing in a most intelligent and
comprehensive way, it would seem a
good idea if Australians looked care-
fully at these criticisms to see if they
can be directly transferred to Australia.
This seems to be more or less the
case with the report produced last
month by a working party under
Professor Michael Swann. Given the
particular job of inquiry into why
science graduates are reluctant to enter
industry or teaching, it came up with
the more general conclusion that both
the schools and the universities en-
courage premature specialisation, which
is to say that the specialist learns
skills that are soon out of date. Lack-
ing a general feel for his subject that
gives him a framework to which he
can add new things throughout his
life, he tends to stick to the few old
things he has learned, and the safest
place in which he can do this is a
university. The “standards” of the uni-
versities are, in effect, a declaration
that the task of the universities is
to turn out people who will be good
at filling jobs in universities and
sometimes nowhere else.
These criticisms of premature
specialisation and educational tra-
ditionalism apply beyond the question
of science education. They apply to
our whole system of education, which
in educational terms is a
specialist system of premature elitism
like the education systems of Britain
and of Western Europe generally. Un-
like the education system of America,
our education system funnels young
people off early into specialist conduits.
In one sense it is more elitist than the
Western European systems, because
there is less of it to go around.
In America specialisation and elite-
picking are postponed, so that both
in the schools and the universities edu-
cation is broader. Not only do the
scientists have a better chance to get
some understanding of other fields of
speculation but and this is even
more important the non-scientists
can acquire a feeling for the general
perspectives of science and an under-
standing of the role of mathematics.
Without these, full participation in the
society of the future will not be
possible. No doubt the Swann com-
mittee had this in mind when it
recommended a much broader first
degree, followed by far more short
courses to acquire particular skills at
intervals in a career.
That in America there are propor-
tionately fewer “specialists” (with their
in-built obsolescence), and that the non-
scientists know something of the
approaches of mathematics and science,
may be the critical factor in America’s
unparalleled technological efficiency.
They may also be critical factors in the
broader uses of education as a means
of increasing general human potential.
But as an article in the London
“Observer” pointed out in its com-
ments on the Swann recommendations:
“The need for this (less specialisation)
is obvious. The main obstacle is that
it directly opposes some of the most
cherished practices and beliefs of many
academics and schoolmasters.”
The “Observer” article had a liberat-
ing effect when it made the point that
higher education can become enmeshed
in emotional attitudes closely con-
nected with a puritan tradition and a
monastic heritage and “a view of
examinations and of higher education
generally as a series of ordeals leading
to reward for the virtuous and punish-
ment for those lacking fibre.” Like all
puritan extremes, the slogan “more
means worse,” the use of words like
“depth” or “rigor” or “discipline,” the
association of “higher” education with
the concept of purity, the idea of pre-
ordained “standards,” the savagery of
failure rates, and the fear of “general-
ising” are inhuman not only in their
results (which are mainly to muck
people up) but in the narrow assump-
tions they make about the nature of
human beings.
That these assumptions about human
beings are false is an idea that might
best be sustained by again quoting from
the “Observer.” The “Observer” article
says: “Every person is a generalist in
that he has some kind of imaginative
perception of himself, the world around
him, and his role in it (a perception
which may often be limited or
erroneous), and everyone possesses a
variety of specialised skills (notably, in
a literate community, the three Rs)
... To awaken a powerful imaginative
grasp of a subject, to encourage an
accurate total perception of some com-
plex situation, is a vastly more difficult
teaching task than simply imparting
data . . . Mere specialists are seldom
very good at it. Great teachers, like
great scholars, are distinguished by their
capacity not only to digest data but to
perceive and convey their meaning. The
more co'mplex the world becomes the
more time and the more help young
people need to discover its possibilities
in relation to their own talents and
inclinations. Such a perception is the
essential source of real motivation to
learn useful skills (which will then be
acquired more rapidly and efficiently).”
Comment by Alan Reid
WILL THE DLP FIGHT LYING DOWN?
THE DEMOCRATIC Labor Party is
in a dilemma. Its regard for the Gorton
Liberal-Country Party Coalition is fast
vanishing, but the ALP is anathema,
and it has nowhere else to turn.
A powerful section of the DLP wants
to maintain an attitude of near-
neutrality at the next Federal elections,
particularly if they are held need-
lessly in the DLP’s view this year
instead of next year, when the normal
life of the present Parliament is due to
end.
Finance is a factor. The DLP, like
the ALP and Liberals, is feeling the
financial pinch. But when the chips are
down the Liberals and ALP can always
raise some funds. They have a prospect
of government. The DLP has none.
As the DLP Leader, Senator Gair,
pointed out recently, the DLP has
fought three elections and a referendum
in two years. This has left it more
heavily in debt than at any time in its
14-year history. New elections would
bankrupt it if held before it had a
chance to recover its financial equi-
librium.
But its attitude has a deeper basis
than finance. The DLP frankly does
not like the shape the Party believes the
Government’s defence policies are
assuming, although, like everyone else,
the DLP is merely guessing what the
eventual shape is going to be. At the
moment the Government has only the
defence policy it inherited from the
Menzies and Holt governments. This
provides for a forward posture in Asia,
dedication to the United States-
Australian alliance, and the Australian
commitment in Vietnam.
The future policy will emerge out
of the defence reassessment now being
studied by the Defence Committee of
Cabinet, but as yet undecided.
However, the DLP does not like what
it thinks this study is going to produce.
Its own policy boils down to main-
tenance of the United States-Australian
alliance, fortified by what the DLP
describes as “self-reliance.”
Rightly or wrongly, the DLP believes
that Prime Minister John Gorton is
going to gamble on Australia needing
neither significant defence forces nor
regional allies in the next ten to 15
years- He will, they think, obscure
this approach with impressive words
and will try to preserve a tenuous de-

fence association with the United
States. But they believe that Mr. Gor-
ton is convinced that Australia has ten
or 15 years breathing space, and if it
uses this for development it will be in
a better position to deal with defence
problems of the future.
Confronted with both the defence
and the finance dilemma, a section
of the DLP would like to see Mr-
Gorton’s 38 majority in the House
of Representatives, inherited from
Harold Holt, reduced drastically. This,
they reason, would make him give more
attention to DLP defence views.
Senator Gair has already signalled
his feeling about the Gorton Govern-
ment. He described the Liberals recently
in the Senate as “the most inept
political party with which I have had
dealings, with the exception of the
Country Party.” He also warned that
the DLP might, at an election this year,
“only contest seats which we (the DLP)
have a chance of winning.”
As the DLP has very little chance
of winning any seat, this, in effect,
was a declaration from Senator Gair
that it would consider only contesting
seats which are key ones from its view-
point, and elsewhere would run dead.
This is important to the Govern-
ment. If he held an election this year,
Mr. Gorton could do so only on the
basis of securing a fresh mandate from
the voters. He could claim an un-
qualified mandate only if he succeeded
in enlarging the record majority the
Government already has in the House
of Representatives an unlikely feat
anyway, and a hopeless one if the DLP
retreats into electoral neutrality.
The DLP claims that at least 21
Government Members of the House of
Representatives owe their political
existence to DLP second preferences.
While the absence of DLP candidates
in these 21 seats does hot necessarily
mean that the votes would go to Labor
instead of Government candidates, there
is a risk that a high proportion of them
would do so if, at election time, the
DLP were expressing as publicly as it
is now its doubts about the value of
the Government’s defence intentions.
The four DLP Senators are pretty
long in the tooth politically. They
want to give Mr. Gorton a fright, but
do not want to put the ALP in office.
They realise, moreover, that it is a
risky business to try to manipulate
votes so finely. They could start a
movement in the electorate that they
might not be able to control.
While it is the popular view that
the ALP could never win an election in
its present divided state, it might not
be a case of Labor winning, but of a
government losing. What is interesting
will be to see whether the DLP plays
safe by again supporting the Liberal-
Country Party coalition or says “a
plague on both Government and Opposi-
tion Parties” and takes the risk of
leaving Labor to slug it out with a
government that, for the first time
since 1955,. would be fighting without
the assistance of its DLP ally.


The States stick together
AUSTRALIA
THE PREMIER of South Australia,
Mr. Steele Hall, called it “historic.”
That may have been a bit premature
the Premiers’ conference in Sydney
last week has produced no results yet.
But it was historic in the sense that it
was the first time the Premiers have
met in political conference without the
Commonwealth since their decision
nearly 70 years ago to transfer the
States’ armies, navies, customs houses,
and post offices to the new Federal
Government (which, it was said at the
time, would cost each taxpayer no more
than the price of a dog licence each
year), and, more significantly, the first
time they have met independently since
that even more historic June 30, 1941,
when, as a gesture of wartime solidarity,
the States ceased to levy income tax.
The meeting was the biggest weapon
yet used in the New South Wales Gov-
ment’s campaign against the Federal
Government’s financial policies. The
idea grew out of one of the regular
Wednesday meetings of New South
Wales Parliamentary Liberal and Coun-
try Party members when, it is reported,
Mr. Askin began with a customary and
almost tired reference to the hostility
of Mr. Gorton and Mr. McMahon to
the States and was astounded by the
vehemence with which Ministers and
backbenchers suddenly began calling for
their blood. The meeting broke up when
Mr. Askin said he would call a special
meeting of Cabinet to sift the proposals
and prepare a plan of action.
The final plan included a protracted
debate in the New South Wales Parlia-
ment to publicise the issues, letters to
all MHRs from all MLAs, public
speeches by Ministers, and an invitation
to all Premiers to meet in Sydney. The
debate in Parliament, initiated by Mr.
Leon Punch (CP, Gloucester) came
and went; the letters were sent (and not
answered); the public speeches were
delivered (there were some good mom-
ents): Justice Minister Maddison said
he was damned if he would help any
more Federal Members in elections;
Health Minister Jago said in effect that
the Federal authorities were liars
“not beyond deliberately deceiving the
public” were his words; and Transport
Minister Morris said he was sick of
paying out $4.5m. payroll tax every
year to “the userers in Canberra”
enough for a new bus or ferry fleet in
a year.
But the Premiers’ conference was to
be the main event. The Premiers (with
the exception of Queensland Premier
Mr. J. Bjelke-Petersen, who was over-
seas and was represented in Sydney by
his Treasurer, Mr. G. W. Chalk)
arrived in the familiar but genuine
atmosphere of crisis. Even Western
Australia’s Mr. D. Brand, who flew in
in a Federal VIP jet and who gets twice
as much per head for each Western
Australian under the current arrange-
ments (over $2OO each as against $lOO
for each Victorian or New South Welsh-
man), said mildly: “All States are find-
ing the going difficult.”
But they also met in an atmosphere
of scepticism. How could the smaller
States ever reach agreement with New
South Wales and Victoria? Is Tas-
mania, out of a sense of justice, going
to say it will cut back on spending
on its schools and hospitals in order to
help Victoria’s schools and hospitals?
Premiers’ meetings in Canberra have
never been occasions for unity as each
State fights the others for a bigger cut
and the Commonwealth exploits the
divisions to get its own way. (In 1965
when the present tax reimbursement
formula was settled, the States rejected
it until Prime Minister Menzies stood
up and said that if they could not
agree, the old formula, which was
worse, would have to continue and in
any case he had a plane to catch. The
States toed the line. Nowadays Mr.
Gorton is even more peremptory.)
The problem was solved in Sydney
on Friday by agreeing not to argue
about what each State should get but
to work for a better deal for the States
as a whole. The details can be argued
about after that is achieved. The
Premiers’ complaint is that the States
are all getting less because the Com-
monwealth takes over State money for
Federal projects. Agreement was
reached on four levels. First, a united
front is to be maintained to improve
the tax reimbursement formula; now
it allows for increases to meet wage
or population increases, but obviously,
according to the Premiers, not enough.
For example, Sir Henry Bolte ex-
plained, the recent increases in wages
by the Commonwealth Industrial Com-
mission will cost the States s24m. a
year but the formula will only allow
them s9m. to meet this. The formula
also includes a factor for “betterment.”
This Canberra word is meant to cover
improvement in social services: the
Premiers say that a look at the schools,
hospitals, railways, and roads will in-
dicate its worth.
Second, the Premiers want to re-enter
tax fields with “growth.” South Aus-
tralia’s Mr. Hall favors the Canadian
system whereby the Federal and State
Governments share income taxing. (It
would be “eminently workable and
equitable” in Australia, he says.) But
the favored move among the Premiers
is to enter the payroll-tax field.
Third, the Premiers agreed to press
the Commonwealth for greater help in
social services. For example, at the
moment, the Commonwealth pays $5
a day toward the cost of hospital treat-
ment of pensioners and the State pays
up to $25 a day. Fourth, the Premiers
will ask the Commonwealth for help
with State debts. The States are carry-
ing most of the national debt. They
finance their public works from loans
and pay ssoom. a year in interest,
while the Commonwealth finances its
works out of tax moneys on which
it pays no interest.
These agreements between the
Premiers are yet to be tested. There
will be another meeting in Adelaide
before Christmas, when details will be
worked out. There is also no sign of
any desire to appease the States by
Mr. Gorton (as distinct from his middle-
level public servants, who, the Premiers
say, do not all share the Prime Minis-
ter’s centralist dreams).
Meanwhile, the Commonwealth had
the last laugh. The new wages
announced by the Commonwealth In-
dustrial Commission will further
cripple the States, but while the Com-
monwealth will have to pay the wages
to each Commonwealth employee it
will also collect increased taxes from
every wage earner in the country. As
Sir Henry Bolte said, it will make a
profit on the deal.


VIETNAM CENSORSHIP
"UNREASONABLE"
THE GOVERNMENT has for a long
time been unhappy with Press and tele-
vision reporting of the war in Vietnam,
feeling it unsympathetic and destructive
of the Government line. But, whatever
the Government’s judgment, it looked
as though its Members were prepared
simply to take this criticism, as they
take other criticism and reporting
which doesn’t quite suit them, and
charge it up as the price of democracy.
Last week, however, for the first time
it really began to look as though the
Government was serious about intro-
ducing censorship. The furore arose
when Mr. Creighton Burns reported to
the Melbourne “Age” from Vietnam
that “new blanket censorship restrictions
have been imposed on all correspon-
dents reporting the activities of Aus-
tralian Armed Forces in Vietnam.” It
was a bit of a beat-up story because
what had been imposed was nothing
like “blanket censorship.” Later in the
story, Burns wrote that correspondents
were being asked to undertake to clear
with an Army public relations man re-
ports of conversations with Army men.
This in itself is of course not unusual.
What Mr. Bums, in the strictest
accuracy, should have said was that
he had stumbled on the fact that the
Government was seriously considering
introducing “blanket censorship restric-
tions.” He was evidently shown regu-
lations in draft on relations between
the Armed Services and the Press,
which had been sent to Vietnam as
guidance and were, in the meantime,
to be used at the discretion of the
commanding officer.
Ever since he has arrived in Vietnam
the new commander, General McDon-
ald, has been pressing Canberra to give
him instructions about handling the
Press. In May the Defence Department,
as part of its unification drive, decided
to draft regulations on handling of the
Press to be applied in all Services.
These were applied more stringently
than Pressmen and some officers in
Vietnam liked, and complaints were
made. Canberra ordered General
McDonald to stop requiring written
guarantees from journalists that they
would clear material with the Army’s
PR outfit. Instead, it appears, he asked
for verbal guarantees, which Canberra
doesn’t like either. But Canberra isn’t
sure what it wants, and numerous
amendments and redrafts have floated
back and forward on the radio-teletype
between the defence complex at Russell
Hill and the Task Force at Nui Dat.
Mr. Burns reported that one of these
drafts prohibited servicemen from dis-
cussing with newsmen “any matter
which is subject to public or political
controversy” or “any defence or service
matter related to policy, administration,
plans, conditions of service or equip-
ment.” In addition, “impressions deriv-
ing from service activities” could not
be given.
This obviously went far beyond exist-
ing restrictions, which are designed to
prevent reporting of information of
value to the enemy, and therefore likely
to endanger Australian troops. It went
miles beyond censorship on “security”
grounds, a form of censorship which has
been accepted all along by Australian
newsmen as a matter of course. No
claim has ever been made that news
reporting has breached security.
The Army has been all the time ex-
tremely reluctant to provide journalists
with routine information supplied freely
by both the Americans and the Viet-
namese. Australian briefing sessions for
journalists are already far sparser and
less useful than those given by the
major commands, or by the Koreans for
that matter. And that has been one of
the reasons why the reportage of Aus-
tralian operations has been less mean-
ingful and thorough -- and has not
satisfied the Government.
Cabinet now has to make up its
mind. Defence Minister Fairhall quickly
showed he was right on the side of the
censors last week when he pointed out
that Australian correspondents were
housed with the troops in Vietnam and
were free to move around the camp
and talk. He said: “It is not un-
reasonable that correspondents should
be required to clear material gained
in this way with responsible and in-
formed officers.”
The trouble is that correspondents
are certain to find it quite “unreason-
able” and to refuse to operate under
a system whereby they are required to
cede to Army PR-men the right to
blue-pencil any part of their dis-
patches. It implies a form of sweeping
censorship even the Vietnamese have
long since abandoned.
THE MLC AFFAIR
BACKING DOWN
WHEN TREASURER Harold Holt
was out of the country, his Prime
Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, often
liked to be his own Acting-Treasurer.
Apparently Mr. Gorton shares this
liking. With Treasurer McMahon
overseas, Mr. Gorton stood in but
in a style different from Sir Robert’s.
How does the Treasury com’muni-
cate with the Prime Minister’s Depart-
ment? In his days, Sir Robert saw
the joke. He started by writing him-
self a letter, conveying “warm personal
regards” from Acting-Treasurer Men-
zies to PM Menzies.
With Mr. Gorton, matters have not
been quite so jovial. Mr. Gorton took
over the position of Acting-Treasurer
on Friday, September 13, the day the
Treasurer received a letter from Mr.
Deer of the MLC company asking the
Government to stop a foreign take-
over. Not usually superstitious 'men,
Treasury officials now mutter about
the significance of the date, as a
nasty beginning to their relationship
with Mr. Gorton.
He immediately asked for briefs on
the MLC affair, and the Treasury
obliged by suggesting a number of
courses, depending on his general
policy on foreign takeovers. Com-
plaints were transmitted back from the
Prime Minister that the guidance
hadn’t been clearcut enough. Days
passed. Nothing more was heard. Then,
out of the blue of Perth at the week-
end came the emotive announcement
that foreign sharebuyers “cloaking
their identity” (it turns out they are a
British company) would be prevented
from a “raid” against the present
board of directors.
Treasury officials, acutely aware of
the fate of the External Affairs
Department now that Mr. Gorton
thinks its officers are against him, are
being extremely discreet in their com-
ments on the affair, but one senior
man last week gave an indication of
their thinking when he commented:
“I’d think there was a lot more poli-
tics in the decision than economics.”
Treasury officials have in the past
been strong supporters of the “open
McMahon...overseas last week at
an International Monetary Fund Board
of Governors’ meeting
door policy” to foreign capital, which
has been traditional under previous
Liberal Governments. They have put
their views on record on numerous
occasions, and inquiring people are
referred to these statements.
There is a good deal of feeling in
Canberra that Mr. Gorton will aban-
don his stand against the MLC take-
over. Extreme difficulty is being
experienced in framing appropriate
legislation. But, more important,
doubts about the wisdom of Govern-
ment intervention are growing. The
H. G. Palmer debacle in which the
MLC was heavily involved is in the
minds of many, and they are asking:
if another group of men can do a
better job of managing the resources
of the subscribers why should they be
prevented fro'm operating through the
market to take over?
They point out that Mr. Gorton
probably acted without realising the
limitations already on insurance com-
panies. The Government has control to
prevent subscribers’ funds being taken
out of the country, and a foreign


management would probably have in-
terests similar to a local management.
Their general policy of making the
business a going and profitable concern
would be similar, only they might be
more vigorous and skilful in going about
it, which would be of benefit to every-
one.
THE PRESIDENCY
AUSTRALIAN VIEWS
IN CANBERRA the Gallup Polls and
the judgment of American commen-
tators is being accepted. It is assumed
that the next U.S. President will be
Richard Nixon. Certainly nothing being
reported to the Government by observers
in the Australian Embassy in Washing-
ton contradicts this in any way.
For most Ministers, Nixon will be
the best outcome since, contrary to
some judgments in America, they think
he is the man most likely to hold
American policy in Asia. Humphrey
is thought more of an opportunist who
would cave in to pressures. They tend
to see an analogy between Humphrey
and the kind of Australian Labor Party
politician who, although basically an
anti-Communist hardliner, can be worn
down.
Some people in the Country Party,
however, are apprehensive about a
Republican administration because of
the likelihood that it will be more
restrictionist in its trade policies. But
with harsh restrictions just having been
placed on meat exports, and with no
progress having been made on elimin-
ating the duty on wool, the Country
Party probably thinks the Democrats
and the Republicans are much of a
muchness.
The public view, of course, is that who-
ever wins the election, American foreign
policy cannot be much different from
now. Mr. Gorton, and much more Mr.
Hasluck, has said that American policy
cannot change because American in-
terests in Asia are the same. Mr. Has-
luck may believe this, but there is no
sign that anyone else in the Govern-
ment does. All the others believe in
varying degrees that the mood of
America is retractionist, and that there
will be growing reluctance on the part
of American administrations to be in-
volved singlehanded in the defence of
South-East Asia.
Of course, for people in the Govern-
ment who are unable to make decisions
on the direction of Australian foreign
policy, the American elections are a
good excuse for their inaction. Once
the election is over they will be arguing
that Australia needs to wait to see
what the new President’s policy is. And
then it will be something else.
But for the time being the betting is
heavily on Nixon, and his articles on
foreign affairs (the key one of which
“Asia After Vietnam” was published in
The Bulletin) are in demand around
various departmental and parliamentary
libraries.
A chat with Aborigine leaders
JOHN GORTON
WINNING THE WEST
HOW THE WEST was won: Bunbury
football star Sydney Jackson was
stopped from playing this season in
Victoria because of administrative red-
tape, then threatened with being unable
to play overseas with a touring side, the
“Galahs,” because his birthdate is listed,
with other W.A. part-Aboriginals, as
July 1. Thus his passport was delayed,
and that fact made known to visiting
Prime Minister John Gorton last week.
“I’ll fix it,” said Mr. Gorton, and a few
minutes later he had the pipeline cleared
with the comment, “It was one of those
blasted bits of red-tape.”
By cutting red-tape, kissing babies
and centenarians, being photographed
with Mrs. John Curtin, calling for un-
scheduled stops to talk with children,
and getting among the people, Mr.
Gorton won the West.
In a State that distrusts politicians,
particularly the Canberra variety, Mr.
Gorton showed up as not much of a
politician but a hell of a good bloke.
And to a State that has cowed before
the leadership figure of Sir Robert Men-
zies, Mr. Gorton showed up as a new
type of leader of men. His printed
word may have been often waffle, but
his oratorical chats—elbow on lectern—
made up in warmth and understanding
what they lacked in rhetoric and logic.
After a Liberal rally that attracted 640
people, most of whom later got to talk
to Mr. Gorton, one Party leader
beamed, “It’s this facility for getting'
on with people I like. You can just see
him in a small country town mingling
with the football team in the local pub
and enjoying local life. That’s a good
image for a Liberal to project.” And
at the Italian Club the following day his
down-to-earth approach was no less
effective.
Mr. Gorton then agreed with Lord
Mayor Tom Wardle that it might be a
good idea to have a Federal Cabinet
meeting in Perth. With a favorable
Autographs for school children
editorial the “West Australian” got
behind him following the MLC affair,
in which he asserted that Australians
should put up more risk capital and
overseas companies should not be
allowed to pick off Australian com-
panies.
Mr. Gorton agreed that Fremantle
was a part of the Commonwealth most
needing protection. He spoke with sur-
prising strength on the need for Liberals
to do more for the aged and under-
privileged. He warmed both Party and
people with a statement on Liberal
principles and individual rights (the
issue caused tension following some
State Government actions). Then he
warmed the Government, too, with the
words Commonwealth-State finances;
although Premier David Brand later
was seeking out others to see if they had
agreed with his interpretation of the
Gorton line. Because, when it was all
boiled down, there was no definite
Gorton line or firm undertaking on any
of these points. He had simply said
what Western Australians wanted him
to say. His gestures at parish-pump
level had been effective, but, at this
stage, meaningless.
The Prime Minister, backed by a kind
Press, had made himself known in the
West, but whether or not he can follow
this introduction with action that will
rppair the damaged Canberra-Perth axis
is still to be proved.
TEACHERS
ONLY SIMMERING
THE FOUR THOUSAND teachers
demonstrating outside New South
Wales Parliament House last week
must have been among the mildest
demonstrators that Parliament has seen.
Ope or two attendants were enough to
stop them entering the House and de-
|piijte choruses against Education Min-
ister Cutler of “Cutler Can’t Cope” and
“Hang Cutler,” they had little oppor-
tunity to express their rage on anyone
except a group of Ascham schoolgirls
who had come into town to watch
democracy at work. After the first
hour small groups of the teachers were
allowed in to interview their Members
of Parliament. The House was packed


with laughing, good-humored, and
courteous schoolies, arguing the toss
about conditions and salaries. Back in
the suburbs many schools continued
business as usual (the decision to close
or not seemed to depend largely on the
influence of the headmaster of each
school) but clearly from the Teachers’
Federation point of view the strike was
a success. Most schools were closed—
for the first time in the history of New
South Wales.
Two lessons from the strike. The first
is the obvious one. The New South
Wales schools are suffering from
shortages of staff, buildings, and equip-
ment-even if they are better off than
any other State. The second lesson
is that the New South Wales Govern-
ment has shown itself as very feeble in
public relations. The facts may well
be that the New South Wales class
sizes are falling (average 33 in Primary
schools, 31 in high schools), that the
pupil/teacher ratio is improving (28
in Primary schools, 17 in High schools),
that teachers’ colleges are being built,
that the school building program in
New South Wales is the most spectacu-
lar in the history of Australia, that
teacher trainees’ allowances are going
up, and so on, but very few people
know about it. The Education Depart-
ment shows it is proud of its achieve-
ment, but it keeps its pride to itself.
Even the proposal for an Education
Commission to replace the Public Ser-
vice Board in control of teachers’ work-
ing conditions looks like coming off
soon. The Premier, Mr. Askin, has
stated that the panel of inquiry estab-
lished to look into the proposal will
Scenes in Sydney when N.S.W. teachers
and trainees struck last Tuesday
submit its report later this month or
early next. The problem has hinged
on the demand by the Teachers’
Federation to have the right to recall;
its representative on the Commission
if he exercises his own judgment and
does not do what the Federation tells
him to do.
One other thing is clear. This will
not be the last time. When over 20,000
more students entering the school sys-
tem have to be accommodated, at least
20 new high schools will be needed
almost overnight and New South Wales
is obviously not going to get them
that quickly.
As to the other States, teachers in
both South and Western Australia were
talking about industrial action late last
week; South Australians holding a mass
protest meeting last Friday night after
a 20 percent wages increase had been,
rejected and the State’s 7000 teachers
given $2-3 extra instead; and Western
Australians reacting angrily to their
Education Minister’s statement that
there would be no further review of
their salaries this year, after minimal
increases last June.
SCIENTOLOGY
MORE BANS
OPENING THE Legislative Council
debate last week on his six-point code
to outlaw Scientology, the South Aus-
tralian Chief Secretary, Mr. Degaris,
explained that, in the opinion of the
Government, Scientology had “inflicted
and is capable of inflicting untold dis-
tress and harm to the mental health
and social fabric of the community.”
His Bill provides a $2OO fine for
demanding or receiving a fee or reward
for the teaching, practice, or application
of Scientology, and a $5OO fine or
two years’ imprisonment for a second
or subsequent offence. It gives the
Government power to seize the organ-
isation’s records, and includes clauses
banning or providing for the banning
by regulation of any practice or teach-
ing which, by opinion, is derived from,
related to, or akin to Scientology. It is,
in fact, a very widely drawn Bill which
could be interpreted as even pro-
scribing the possession of books relating
to Scientology in libraries, and the
critical examination of its methods in
universities, so that it is not surprising
that academics and civil-liberties organ-
isations have expressed concern and
criticism of the Bill generally and
particularly.
Until last week the Labor Opposi-
tion’s stance was non-committal, but
with the opening of the debate it came
out strongly against the Bill. Announ-
cing that he would move to have the
Bill withdrawn, Opposition Leader Mr.
Don Dunstan held that a parliamentary
select committee should decide whether
measures are needed to protect the
public from the cult. Describing the
Bill’s provisions as sweeping and threat-
ening to the ordinary private rights of
citizens, he explained that when in
office the Labor Government had
refused to register businesses and com-
panies associated with Scientology, but
that no evidence had been available to
show that it was vital for public protec-
tion to limit civil liberties. On the basis
of a file made available by the Chief
Secretary, the Opposition could find no
further evidence to support the meas-
ures. In fact, Dunstan went on to say,
complaints had far more frequently
been made to the Government concern-
ing the Watchtower and Bible Society
and the Exclusive Order of the
Plymouth Brethren.
With Government Members given a
free vote on the measure, the Opposi-
tion’s move in the Upper House for a
select committee may succeed; if not,
it will certainly press for this in the
Lower House and from a position of
some strength. But the Government is
heavily committed now to the measures,
Premier Hall having joined his Chief
Secretary in strongly denouncing the
organisation.
In other moves last week, the defiant
Scientologists attacked the Federal
Member for Adelaide, Mr. Andrew
Jones, in a broadsheet distributed in
his electorate and took out a writ
against him claiming damages for libel.
“Sue and be damned,” said Mr. Jones.
A writ was also issued against Mr.
Degaris, claiming damages for alleged
conspiracy entered into between him-
self as Health Minister, three other
named men, and others. The three
named men are the Health Ministers
of New South Wales, Victoria, and
Western Australia.
The Health Minister of Western
Australia, Mr. MacKinnon, last week
introduced a Bill in the Legislative
Council with much the same provisions
as the South Australian one, but pro-
viding also for a $2OO fine for any
person using a galvanometer on
another to measure emotional reaction;
a galvanometer being an instrument
more nor'mally used by electricians to
measure electrical current or resist-
ance. Mr. MacKinnon said the para-
mount reason for outlawing the cult
was Scientology’s method of pillorying
people who decided to leave the
organisation.

The significance of a symbol
No. i OF A SERIES BACKGROUND OF A COMPANY
A Company’s history is normally of great interest only to veteran shareholders, ex-employees and
perhaps, investment analysts.
The true significance of a progressive Company revolves around its management stability, its
planning flexibility, its product depth.
Until about 3 years ago, George Hudson was generally recognized as a timber specialist. Timber
milling; Timber importing; Timber retailing. Essentially a family Company, it had a reputation for
service and for specialist trade knowledge.
Nothing more. But equally, nothing less.
Today this has broadened. True, timber retailing outlets are still there. But today they are entire
service centres to the building trade. True, the mills are still there. But today they have been updated
with modern plant and production methods.
Management and staff have benefited from the Company’s traditional skills which have been adapted
to meet the Building Industry’s changing conditions. A carefully-planned diversification programme
has resulted in a series of sophisticated products and services.
The impetus of modern management has added new dimensions to the Company’s horizons.
New policies, new products, new processes—these represent the significance of the new GH symbol.

The fountain, set in Adelaide’s Victoria

aluminium casting ever made in Australia.
The main basin is cast in one piece 11 ft.
across, and weighs 3940 lbs. The three
figures symbolising South Australia's
three main rivers weigh 500 lbs. each.
The complete set of castings, in a high
silicon type aluminium alloy, was
produced by Castalloy Limited, Adelaide.
The Adelaide City Council commissioned
John Dowie to sculpt the fountain to
commemorate Queen Elizabeth's visit in
1963. It was officially opened by Prince
Philip in May, 1968.

THE ALP
RARE CANDIDATE
From HARVEY STOCKWIN
DIPLOMATS RESIGNING to contest
parliamentary seats are rare, diplomats
twice thrown out of Russia are equally
scarce, and a diplomat who is also a
qualified butcher is not an everyday
occurrence; a seasoned diplomat twice
declared persona non grata by Moscow,
who is a qualified butcher and whose
parliamentary candidature was greeted
by Prime Ministerial speculation, must
be the rarest of all. Such is Mr. Bill
Morrison, councillor at the Australian
High Commission in Kuala Lumpur
since the beginning of last year, who
last week won an uncontested pre-
selection for the Labor Party in the
swinging seat of St. George.
“Congratulations and welcome to the
club, I didn’t know you were a dirty
socialist!” wrote the executive secretary-
general of the United Malays Nation-
alist Organisation (UMNO) to Mr.
Morrison upon hearing the news, add-
ing: “Pardon my undiplomatic langu-
age, but we ‘dirty’ politicians are
rough!”
“I should imagine if he had access
to any sensitive material he would find
it difficult to decide whether to be a
Labor candidate or a public servant
divorced from politics,” was Mr. Gor-
ton’s reported rough welcome to the
club.
But, having reported politics over
the past 19 years from places as diverse
as Moscow, Bangkok, Washington, and
Kuala Lumpur, it is unlikely that Bill
Morrison has any illusions about the
nature of politics of politicians. He
was first thrown out of Moscow along
with the rest of the Embassy after the
Petrov affair in 1954. After the
Skripov affair in 1963 he was, in the
words of the then CIA director, Allen
Dulles, in his book “The Craft of
Intelligence,” “charged with collecting
intelligence and illegally selling second-
hand clothes to Soviet citizens,” which,
as a trumped-up story, scarcely had
“even minimal credibility.”
Second-hand clothing is not Mr.
Morrison’s trade, but butchery was. He
learnt it at his father’s side in Sydney
at an early age and has the scars to
prove it. Even while at Sydney Univer-
sity after the war (he did political
science) he still had time for an early
butcher run before his first lecture. The
only time this skill has come in useful
since was when the Argentinian
"Ambassador once imported a whole
bullock for a Moscow barbecue and
Mr. Morrison obliged with the skilled
dissection of the animal.
Now he has faced up to the prospect
of carving-up one career and slicing
into another. With good diplomatic
prospects before him and three children
to worry over, it could scarcely have
been an easy decision, though his
American-born wife was not surprised
that he took it. When Opposition
Leader Gough Whitlam visited Kuala
Lumpur during his Asian tour earlier
in the year he was, presumably, im-
pressed with Mr. Morrison, then tempor-
arily in charge of the High Commission.
Evidently at some later stage Mr. Whit-
lam phoned to ask Mr. Morrison if he
was interested and gave him three days
to decide.
The decision to allow his name to
be put forward—he has been a Labor
Party member for the past four years—
was probably the result of the earthy
pragmatism that runs through Mr.
Morrison’s conversations. He sees
much of the talk about Australia being
an Asian country as glossing over not
only the very fundamental differences
between all Asian States, let alone their
differences from Australia, but also as
unlikely by itself to solve the funda-
mental problem, that of identifying and
wherever desirable merging the national
interests of Australia with those of its
Asian neighbors. In the broad he
favors bilateral forms of such merging
Morrison...“creeping involvement”
rather than multilateral forms in which
the merging can be diluted.
For the moment, Mr. Morrison works
scrupulously within the Public Service
regulations he will resign once
nominations are called and in the
normal course of events will be in
Kuala Lumpur until February next
year. So comments are kept to the
broad and the uncritical. Just possibly,
though, behind the generalisations lurks
the conviction that the foreign-policy
question is how Australia should be
committed here rather than whether,
and the belief that insufficient has
been done politically to identify Aus-
tralia’s interests in relation to her
neighbors? Certainly in private he can
argue effectively on the liabilities for
the West of static force commitments,
and the dangers of what he calls
“creeping involvement beyond a
nation’s capacity or self interest.”
So, while for the time being he is
understandably less articulate than he
can be, one is left with the thought
that were Mr. Gorton also able to
attract members of Australia’s diplo-
matic corps into his side of the parlia-
mentary arena the prospect would be
a far 'more informed debate on Austra-
lia’s future role than has been in evi-
dence so far this year.


Everyone's up in armchairs...
This is the seat of the rebellion!
To look at them, you’d never believe how warlike
some people can be. But then this is the “after”
picture.
The “before” was the day they heard about the
BOAC Armchair . . . how it has all this stretch-your-
legs-right-out room, and big, big contours all smoth-
ered in foamy soft upholstery. And they were
missing out!
Lavender and old lace just weren’t in it . . . the day
they realised the most comfortable economy class
seat in the world was passing them by.
Now they’re up in Armchairs. Along with just about
everyone else. It’s a lot of fun up there.
Incidentally, BO AC have 10 Armchair flights a week
out of Australia to London and Europe. Seven a
week West via India, three a week East via the
U.S.A.
Why don’t you call your travel agent, BOAC, or
Qantas, General Sales Agents for BOAC, and make
a booking?
When there’s a rising, the most peaceful place is the
seat of the rebellion.

Mexican games that
soldiers can play
On guard duty

City plaza,

student riots,

soldiers doze

noonday sun
LAST WEEK’S massacre in Mexico
City’s Plaza de las Tres Culturas sprang
from a national crisis much more
deeply rooted, complex, and confused
than a mere students’ revolt.
Even the number that died is uncer-
tain: it may have been 30 or 40 or 50.
(The Student Council said 200 people
were killed.)
But this is reasonably certain: they
were not predominantly Communists,
they were not professional agitators,
and they were not all students. A uni-
versity lecturer puts it like this: “We
are not interested in being with Mao,
with Castro, with the Vatican, with
Johnson, with the Left, or with the
Right. We are not interested in labels.
We are fighting for Mexico, our liberty,
our constitution. We want better food,
better homes, better health for our
children.”
On Wednesday night the demonstra-
tors had a more limited demand.
Upwards of 5000, mostly, but not all,
students, gathered in the Plaza. Their
object was to call on the Army to
withdraw from the Polytechnic build-
ings, as they had already dqne from
University City.
The Plaza, a natural choice for large
public meetings, is bounded on one side
by a preparatory school of the Poly-
technic, but a more important advan-
tage is that the vast block of workers’
flats forming another side has balconies
that make convenient platforms for
speakers.
The balconies look out across a paved
area of two acres, over the ruins of an
Aztec pyramid to a main road. On the
right is the school, and on the left a
magnificent colonial church, dwarfed by
the tower of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. The blend of three cultures, of
Aztec, colonial, and severely modern
architecture, gives the place its name.
When the meeting started the first
speaker announced a change of plans.
“The meeting will finish here,” he said.
“Afterwards everybody must go home.
We know that the Army is going to
provoke us if we march in procession.”
A British journalist, John Rodda, of
the “Guardian,” was on another balcony
close to the speakers. What happened
to him is baffling. From behind the
church, over this peaceful meeting, two
green very lights arched into the air.
Sensing trouble, Rodda turned to find
a pistol being pointed at him by a man
in civilian clothes. He was ordered to
lie down. Within seconds, the Plaza
was a battleground. Two helicopters
cruised overhead and some alleged that
machine-guns were fired from their
open doors. Rodda himself has reported
the details of the next horrifying hours.
Eventually he was able to establish that
the men behind the pistols the men
who were there before the shooting
started were security police. Each
wore one white glove to identify him
to his colleagues.
Two hours later, in the middle of
the night, special buses arrived outside
one of the Olympic Press centres and
hurried the reporters to the Presidential
palace. The President’s Press Secretary
announced 20 dead and 75 slightly
wounded. Apparently there were no
seriously wounded.
Next morning, as rumors swept the
Press centre that sniping was still going
on, Princess Grace of Monaco, in a
cool white hat, smiled and nodded her
way past the telex machines clattering
out the stories of the carnage. In the
Camino Real Hotel, the International
Olympic Executive Committee deliber-
ated whether the Games should con-
tinue.
In a hotel room last Friday night,
a university lecturer, an anthropology
student, a civil servant and his wife
tried to explain the situation calmly:
“To understand you must go back to
1946, to the regime of the last military
President, General Manuel Avila
Camacho. It was from him that our
present President, Gustavo Diaz Ordaz,
started. They come from the sa'me
State, Puebla. Diaz Ordaz began his
-political career in Camacho’s shadow.
You may not know it, but we have
one of the most advanced constitutions
in the world. Diaz Ordaz has stamped
on it.”
Diaz Ordaz, whose grandfather was
associated with the dictatorship ended
by the bloody revolution of 1910, is
accused of reverting to type. “Of all
the Presidents since 1929 when the
present ruling Partido Revolucionario
Institucionista was founded he is
the worst. He is inefficient, and yet he
has taken power completely into his
hands. He is not interested in money
for himself, but he has made sure that
his family have wealth.”
Despite this indictment, the original
aim of “The Movement” an alliance
of students, the progressive middle-
class, and workers resentful of union
subordination to the regime was not
the removal of Diaz Ordaz. They
simply wanted a return to the con-
stitution and “the end of repression.”
But now, sickened by the killings of
these past three months, “The Move-
ment” has changed its objectives. Its
members are beginning to feel that Diaz
Ordaz is discredited beyond redemp-
tion. They insist that the deaths are
on a far greater scale that the world
imagines. They describe in detail the
Government’s technique for wiping out
all traces of some of those who have
died. They talk of bodies being burned,
of documents confiscated and destroyed,
of names eradicated from official regis-
ters, and families terrorised into silence.
There are few countries in which
such stories would be given credence.
But in Mexico, where nine million of
the 40 million people cannot read or
write, where an eight-year-old girl sell-
ing a newspaper at one o’clock in the
morning stands aside to let a beautiful
young woman in arctic fox step into a
Cadillac anything seems possible.
Some Mexicans say that it is not
a simple conflict between students and
Government. There is, they believe, a
third force at work: the Army. They
point out that there are certain soldiers
not necessarily at the top who
would like to see Diaz Ordaz so dis-
credited that they could seize control
of the country.
They are convinced that the Army
provoked Wednesday night’s troubles.
They say that the very lights were a
signal for planned slaughter. They say
that soldiers in civilian clothes fired
from among the students to justify
massive retaliation. They say that
agents from the Government, the Army,
and the police were shooting from the
flats and rooftops. The theory of a


deliberately engineered clash makes
sense of John Rodda’s account of the
massacre.
The students want a public dialogue
on the restoration of constitutional
rights. They want an inquiry into the
responsibility for the shooting, one that
must be held in front of the Press,
television, and the ordinary people.
Far from getting such an inquiry,
they are being driven underground.
Seventy out of 180 members of “The
Movement’s” national strike committee
have reportedly been arrested. Two
are dead. Those detained are said to
be undergoing torture. But new mem-
bers have been elected to take their
places. They flit from hideout to hide-
out, meeting secretly, never in the same
place twice.
Me'mbers of the committee say they
did not want to stop the Olympic
Games, but they felt the money spent
on the Games should have been used
to attack the grotesque anomalies of
Mexican society. “If the Government
is so smart that they can persuade the
world to let them hold the Olympic
Games, they should be able to solve
the problems at home.” They saw the
Games as an irrelevancy. They refused
to let the Games deflect them.
RUSSIA
"NORMAL" BEHAVIOUR
TALKS BETWEEN Soviet and Czech-
oslovakian leaders in Moscow last week
reasserted unequivocally the authority
of the top three Soviet leaders, Mr.
Brezhnev, Mr. Kosygin and President
Podgorny.
They also mean that Soviet demands
for conformity by Czechoslovakia and
the permanent stationing of Warsaw
Pact troops on the Czech frontier with
West Germany were legitimised, and
that the position of Alexander Dubcek
as unquestioned leader of the Czech
resistance to Moscow was undermined.
The important new development is
agreement for withdrawal of the bulk
of the troops, to be carried out by
stages. This is really what the negotia-
tions were all about. But it is by no
means certain that withdrawal will
begin soon.
' Although the last communique in
August made the troop withdrawals con-
ditional on normalisation of the situation
in Czechoslovakia, last week’s communi-
que avoided mentioning the word “nor-
malisation,” since it has proved to be so
contentious and capable of different
interpretations. Thus the Soviet side at
least seemed to have retained the option
of still making the withdrawal condi-
tional upon “normalisation” if Moscow
feels that the presence of all the troops
should be prolonged.
It appears that there will be a more-
or-less permanent presence of Soviet
troops in the country and the Czechs
have agreed to step up the drive for
conformism according to the dictates of
the Kremlin. However, the Czech
leaders got some satisfaction about their
demands for troop withdrawals. The
purge of men connected with Press,
radio, and television will undoubtedly be
intensified, but once the heat of the
occupation is off the Czechs may
manage to reinstate some of their own
trusted men.
The undermining of Dubcek’s posi-
tion will undoubtedly please Moscow.
But, paradoxically, his position as a
leader has ceased to be a matter of
concern to Moscow. Having got the
accession of all the top Czech leaders to
their demands, whether he remains a
leader or goes will be irrelevant in the
political context of Czech-Soviet rela-
tions.
There is no question, however, that
the position of the Soviet leaders them-
The Czech dele-
gation which
fought—and
lost —in the
latest round of
negotiations
with the
Russians in
Moscow
selves is of much greater significance.
The Soviet leaders are not in a position
to undo completely what has happened
or just let Czechoslovakia resume its
liberal course as before the occupation.
Their authority would be endangered
by such an open reversal of policy.
Provided there is no fresh resistance
in Prague to the latest agreement, the
Soviet leaders can now turn to dealing
with those who brought about and
aggravated the crisis in the first place.
But we may have to wait a long time
for the actual denouement to be seen.
CZECHOSLOVAKIA
BACK TO THE
SOUNDPROOF ROOM
THE MOOD IN Prague, with almost
everyone hunched round the latest
radio news, was one of dismay at the
results of last week’s Moscow confer-
ence between Czech and Russian
leaders. There was a feeling of deeply
disappointed surprise that the Czech
delegation could have accepted such
terms, even on paper, and as soon as
they were known the rumors began that
the whole Czech leadership would
resign.
There were optimists particularly
among Czech journalists who had been
working right up in the front line of
the battle who rightly argued that
the six-point document agreed to in
Moscow was still wide open to inter-
pretation by either side,
But the exhausted and somewhat
reduced figure of Mr. Dubcek stepping
off the plane last week seemed to tell
its own story. The man was still strug-
gling hard, but on some private horizon
the possibility of defeat had been
glimpsed,
The morning papers in Prague front-
paged the text of the agreement without
comment, and no Government spokes-
man would venture much more than a
sad hunch of the shoulders,
The editorial in the Prague paper,
“Rude Pravo,” written by Mr. Josef
Spacek, so far regarded as one of the
leading reformers, was an essay on the
need for the Communist Party to main-
tain its leading role, written in a tone
which Moscow theologians would find
entirely acceptable.
The clause dealing with the need for
Communist Party dominance was
regarded as the one which Moscow
insisted on most strongly. It suggested
that the Russians had required a
return to the centralised bureaucratic
control of the Novotny era, out of
which the Czechs were beginning to
grope after January. It seemed to spell
an end to the democratising upsur-
gence in the Party branches.
But, as with the other clauses, the
Czech people were trying desperately
hard not to believe that there could
have been any such drastic change as
that implied in their leaders’ outlook.
Above all, the clause seemed to mean
that the Czechs were being hauled
very firmly back into the soundproof
room of the Eastern block and away
from all Westernising experiments, and
that foreign policy would studiously
avoid anything at all that looked like
too close a liaison with the West, pos-
sibly in trade as well as in politics.
The new terms also seemed likely to
involve promotion of some older Stalin-
ist conservatives of the Novotny regime.
Bpt, as Moscow must realise, they are
so discredited with the people at large
that they could hardly be influential.
Because of this no one expects a whole-
sale influx of these Novotny men into
the very top ranks of the leadership.
This was taken to mean that military
government was in the offing, although


it was still supposed that Moscow was
resisting this task like a plague.
It is a fair estimate that not more
than 20 percent of the Czech people
have any desire to return to Stalinist
attitudes and even these are chiefly
the disgruntled Party officials and
managers who stood to lose by
Dubcek’s liberal and economic refor'ms.
But it is evident that the Russians
have some disdain for the unity of the
other 80 percent. Yet the Czechs went
on clinging to the threads of hope.
U.S. PRESIDENCY
THE "LOST" COUNTRY
AMERICANS STAGGERED into the
current presidential election campaign
dazed from an unbelievable series of
shocks: the burning of one of their most
typical and prosperous cities, Detroit,
by rioters in July, 1967, for no obvious
reason; the Tet offensive in February,
1968, which forced most people to
recognise that the United States could
not win the war in Vietnam by any
methods that they were prepared to
undertake; the murder first of Martin
Luther King in April and then of Rob-
ert Kennedy in June, making it seem
that assassination was becoming the
way of political life in America; and
finally the violent confrontation
between police and “our own children”
at the Democratic convention in
Chicago at the end of August. Now the
two major Parties are offering what
hardly seems a choice at all between
two shopworn, uninspiring Presidential
candidates, neither of whom appears to
have the imagination or the guts needed
to solve the conglomerate problems of
cities, war, and disillusion which plague
America.
Whichever of the two, Mr. Richard
Nixon or Vice-President Hubert Hum-
Yippie leader Jerry Rubin, bare-chested,
bead-swathed, and armed with a toy
rifle as he appeared before the Un-
American Activities Committee
Hubert Humphrey and some of the 300
youths whose “no more war” chants dis-
rupted one of his campaign meetings
in Oregon
phrey, gets elected on November 5 may
well turn out to be more dynamic than
the critics allow for at present, just as
the problems may turn out to be nearer
solution. But in the meantime both
men are competing for the same middle
political ground and both of them are
beset by dissidents on the Left and on
the Right. Mr. Humphrey suffers the
most because he cannot escape the
almost obsessive revulsion against
President Johnson and all his works
and because most of the dissidents come
from groups which were vital parts of
the old Democratic coalition. The New
Left has claimed the intellectuals and
the young people, who used to be
the soul of the Party, and the New
Right, with its own presidential candi-
date, Mr. George Wallace, has claimed
many blue-collar workers and southern
conservatives who used to put flesh on
the Party’s bones.
The dissidents met each other head
on, or rather head to baton, in the
streets of Chicago at the time of the
Democratic convention. For policemen
in general epitomise the New Right
(although in their case many of the
characteristics are exaggerated): they
are lower-middle-class, poorly educated,
not well paid, but well enough paid to
have possessions and status that they
are afraid of losing. They distrust what
they do not understand and they resent
especially the arrogance of the New
Left, the highly educated young people
who will not conform, who do not work,
who have never known poverty, and
who do not appreciate their economic
and social advantages. The Chicago
police were shocked out of their disci-
pline (as policemen should not be, but
'with their present training and back-
ground will be again) by the unconven-
tional habits and uncontrolled behavi-
our of the young demonstrators, parti-
cularly the girls.
There was wrong on both sides (and,
as fuller details become available, it
looks as if there was more wrong on
the policemen’s side), but the majority
of Americans, reacting not only against
what was happening in the Chicago
parks but also against what they feared
would happen all over the country,
felt that the violence of the police
was justified. This does not necessarily
mean that the majority of Americans
are going to vote for Mr. Wallace in
the election, since Mr. Nixon and,
to a lesser extent, Mr. Humphrey are
both making concessions to this over-
riding concern about “law and order,”
which also has racist implications. But
it does mean that Mr. Wallace is the
only presidential candidate who is a
genuinely popular one, getting spon-
taneous emotional support of the same
kind, though of a very different order,
that Senator McCarthy might have
draw'n if he had been nominated.
The Senator may end up by endors-
ing Vice-President Humphrey, but
hardly with enthusiasm, and his follow-
ers insist that they will take his earlier
advice, voting for candidates for the
Senate and the House of Representatives
and for local offices who share his
ideals, and abstaining in the presi-
dential election. Some dissenters even
say that they will vote for Mr. Nixon
in order to ensure his victory, so that
the present Democratic establishment
will be discredited. Then, they argue
rather naively, they will be able to
refashion the party along their own
lines as some more experienced poli-
ticians are organising to do already.
When it is pointed out that, once
the country has Mr. Nixon, it may have
him for eight years, the reply is that
under present conditions the Presidency
is too much for any man. Mr. Johnson
has been defeated by it and Mr. Nixon
will also give up after four years.
Meanwhile, the young people, who are
well aware that almost half the popula-
tion is under 30 today, will mark time
politically or at least those of them
will who are content to wait that long
before they start to make the country
over, as they are sure that they must
do.
The rather exaggerated belief that the
ills of cities and of Negroes were being
neglected only because of the money


being spent and the attention being
concentrated on the Vietnam War,
coupled in many cases with a normal
objection to war as such, was what first
inspired the disparate groups which are
loosely gathered together in the New
Left. Now, however, there are strong
revolutionary, or rather anarchistic,
tendencies in several of the groups,
notably the Students for a Democratic
Society (or at least in some of its
branches). The annual report of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation is not
far wrong in saying that SDS is “held
together by a bitter hatred” of the
American establishment. Maoist and
Castroist sympathies are widespread; it
has been suggested that the SDS may
get funds from Cuba and the FBI
accuses the organisation of teaching
sabotage. Some of the Negro groups,
such as the Black Panthers, are believed
to have stores of weapons. But those
who know the Negroes and the students
well maintain that none of them are
efficient or wholehearted or well
organised enough to mount an effective
revolution.
What the dedicated members of the
New Left are not prepared to do is to
make any concessions whatsoever to
authority or to compromise in any way
with what they consider to be the out-
worn values of present-day America.
One can sympathise with Mr. Jerry
Rubin when he makes fun of the Con-
gressional Un-American Activities Com-
mittee by appearing before it bare-
chested in beads and w r ar paint and
with a toy rifle. Maybe also the
American Political Science Association
needed to be shaken up a bit, as it was
by the young activists who almost
broke up its September meetings. But
when they organise shouts of “Dump
the Hump” and “Stop the War”
which 'make it almost impossible for
Vice-President Humphrey to speak and
when they threaten to stop other people
from voting on November 5 by going
limp in the polling booths, then they
make even liberal Americans feel that
there is something to be said for
Mayor Daley.
Giving plans for disrupting next
January’s presidential inauguration, one
of the leading activists said that they
wished to put the next President on
notice that they were not “going to
disappear just because Lyndon John-
son has.” Mr. Nixon claims that the
next President will have to take hold
of America, “a country that has lost
its way,” before he can move it for-
ward. The question is how many of
the dissenters will let the'mselves be
taken hold of, will want to move for-
ward with the next President, whoever
he may be. And on the other side he
will almost certainly be urged by the
more reactionary members of the New
Right to take undemocratically repress-
ive action against the agitators whom
Mr. Wallace has already promised to
put in jail. Some of the protesting
minorities have indeed “crossed the
line fro'm dissent to obstruction,” as
Mr. James Reston has pointed out, but
many Americans who would not go as
far as that feel almost as bitterly
frustrated by today’s political pro-
cesses. The one thing that could bring
them back into the mainstream would
be an end to the war in Vietnam.
GREECE
SUCH A LOVABLE JUNTA
ONE MIGHT have thought that any
Western-minded regime would have
been embarrassed by an electoral vic-
tory of more than 90 percent. But not
the Greek military regime, which is now
claiming that the September 29 refer-
endum has given it a popular mandate.
It was a mandate given in a referen-
dum held under martial law, under
conditions which only very imperfectly
preserved the secrecy of the ballot, and
after a completely one-sided campaign
waged by a regime which made assur-
ance doubly sure by scarcely veiled
intimidation.
Whereas in the traditionally Left-
wing Athens-Piraeus district the “yes”
vote was 75 percent, in many country
districts, where the local military and
civil authorities are known to have been
exerting themselves zealously on behalf
of the regime, the vote was close to 100
percent. Although voting was compul-
sory, as many as 22 percent of the
people on the register (which was, how-
ever, out of date) did not vote.
Undoubtedly the referendum has
given the regime greater self-confidence.
It can now claim that it has been made
legitimate; it will be less bothered by
the niggling inferiority complex which
tends to afflict regimes which have
seized and kept power by the
use of force. It will also feel able to
deal more confidently with the Ameri-
cans; and in spite of all the grandilo-
quent talk in Athens about not toler-
ating any tutelage from anyone, the
Government knows quite well that if it
wants to be internationally accepted as
respectable it would be a great help to
win over the Americans. Washington
concedes that the new constitution is a
step forward, but does not regard it as
a decisive act in the process of restoring
parliamentary rule; according to reports
A Greek woman voting in the
referendum
from Athens, the American Government
does not propose to lift the selective
suspension of military aid.
Many Greeks must have voted “yes”
in the belief that this was the only way
open to them to start a return to nor-
mality. When that process will begin,
however, is not all that clear. The
Prime Minister, Mr. Papadopoulos,
promised to grant “more democracy
with the passing of each day” until
the revolution’s goals are reached. But
these goals, designed to carry out far-
reaching economic, social, educational,
and administrative reforms, will take at
least a generation to achieve.
On the face of it, having apparently
been given such a huge vote of confi-
dence, the regime should have nothing
to fear from a reasonably speedy
return to a more nor'mal political life.
But the colonels know perfectly well
that their pressure has distorted the
result of the referendum, and they may
not know how much it has distorted
it. The trouble is that the referendum
could allow them, even encourage
them, to claim that the people have
given them authority to restore parlia-
mentary democracy only when they
themselves feel that this can be safely
done without fear of reverting to the
political confusion and turbulence of
pre-coup days. The Greeks may have
thought they were voting for a return
to parliamentary rule; but at the same
time they voted away, into the indefin-
ite safe-keeping of the colonels, most
of their basic political and civil rights.
The regime has discouraged any
dialogue between itself and the politi-
cians. But some members of the junta
believe that the new constitution might
be more speedily introduced if leading
politicians, like Mr. George Papan-
dreou and Mr. Kanellopoulus, could be
induced to drop their boycott of the
regime and make some kind of
declaration to the effect that the coup
was after all inevitable, and that
they would be willing to resume
political activity under the new rules
of the game. But there is not the
slightest sign that any important
politician will consent to do this,
especially after the exaggerated result
of the referendum.
Some people think that the return
of King Constantine would help
things forward. His presence, presum-
ably under some mutually acceptable
arrangement, could provide some kind
of security for the Greek people that
the ultimate intentions of their present
rulers really are honorable. The King’s
presence might also help to prevent
chaos and bloodshed if the members
of the junta were to fall out irrevocably
among themselves. Finally, it might
also help to convert the sulking con-
tempt of the political leaders into some
kind of active tolerance. If they are
denied this indefinitely, the colonels
might, in their frustration and im-
patience, impose an even stricter dic-
tatorship; thus, they would end by
creating for Greece the same danger
of an attempted Communist takeover
that they claim to have averted.

The consequences
of Sabah
By HARVEY STOCKWIN
THE RIPPLES caused by the Sabah
crisis spread ever wider. The impotency
of American-Philippine relations to
achieve any constructive ends having
been clearly demonstrated both to
Filipinos and, in a different way, to
more objective observers, it has caused
a new bout of anti-Americanism in
the Philippines. More than that, the
crisis is giving a strong assist to the
strain of nationalist chauvinism in the
Republic. Marcos’ Philippines is begin-
ning to sound in more ways more often
like Sukarno’s Indonesia, as Marcos,
like the Bung, appears to be all set to
use the “nationalist tide” to perpetuate
himself in power. The Sabah crisis has
meanwhile served to distract Malaysian
attention from what should be more
pressing problems at home. As long
predicted, it has served to retard and
degenerate the Association of South-
East Asian Nations. Last but by no
means least, it is obviously pushing
Australia toward isolationist. No
less a person than Mr. Hasluck, by
seemingly elevating what might be a
good regional policy guideline into
a dogma, has made Australia appear
that much less attractive an ally. All
of which is not too bad a record for
a dispute that too many for too long
for no good reason (except lack of
perception) refused to take seriously
enough.
The latest developments can be
briefly told. Senate Act 954 was not
of itself the determinant of the
precipitous decline in regional amity.
The Malaysians, in a Note, asked the
Philippines to reaffirm that the claim
was still a policy, not a hard and fast
law, and to reaffirm Philippine respect
for Malaysia’s territorial integrity and
sovereignty, including the constituent
State of Sabah. At this point it was
possible for Marcos to have his claim,
his law, and his friends. All that was
required was a little diplomatic
fudging and the worst of the crisis
could have been avoided. Marcos was
advised of this, but he chose to ignore
that advice. While subsequently writing
a letter to the “New York Times,”
Foreign Secretary Ramos spoke of the
crucial second clause as merely a
“reservation,” but such thoughts found
no expression in the Philippine Note of
reply.
Instead the Filipinos refused all the
assurances the Malaysians sought. No
affirmations of continuing respect until
the claim was settled one way or the
other were given. The Malaysian Note
had been, by any objective criteria,
polite, reasoned, but tough. For their
pains they were accused of “highly
abusive and provocative language . . .
in an unabashed effort to exert
pressure upon and compel the Presi-
dent of the Philippines to countermand
a legitimate act of the Congress . . .
in the discharge of its sovereign
legislative powers.” This was “un-
warrarited interference” and a “most
unfortunate and deplorable reaction”
by and of Malaysia, said the Filipinos.
Malaysia was wholly to blame for
injuring regional peace and stability
by refusing to go to the World Court.
In truth, at that moment, the
Filipino Note was ’most irresponsible.
Not only had it refused to take any
advantage whatsoever of the Malaysian
offer to in effect “muddle through,”
but it also added insult and
invective to obduracy. Having never
received from the Philippines any
official notification of the rescinding
of their July decision to effect a diplo-
matic withdrawal from Kuala Lumpur,
the Malaysians responded in kind by
announcing that they, too, would re-
move all but one of their embassy staff
in Manila, thus “suspending” diplo-
matic relations. Further, since the de
facto respect and recognition of present
Malaysian sovereignty over Sabah had
led to the agreement in the first place,
the Malaysians terminated the Anti-
Smuggling Agreement.
This last was agreed in September
last year and implemented at the
beginning of this year. The southern
Philippines has always tended to trade
southward to Sabah rather than north-
ward to Luzon. The wide range of
dutiable goods which leave Sabah
legitimately for the south have like-
wise tended to take advantage of the
fact that there is no cohesive effective
and purposeful administration of the
Philippine Archipelago. Loss of
revenue by the Philippine Treasury due
to smuggling all over, not just in
the south has tended toward astro-
nomical proportions. Crucially, there-
fore, in the Anti-Smuggling Pact, the
Malaysians compromised their
sovereignty to the extent of allowing
three Philippine Customs officials to be
stationed in the three main exit points
from Sabah to the Sulu area.
In September last year the pact very
nearly wasn’t signed when the Filipinos
objected to the implication of the use
of the word “border” in the agreement
as implying that the claim had been
settled. The patient Malaysians eventu-
ally gave way by agreeing to a rider
that the agreement was without prejud-
ice to the final settlement of the claim.
It was not the only concession on their
part. Whatever the degree of control
exercised by the Filipino Custo'ms offi-
cials, there can be no doubt that the
trade tended to dry up on the principle
beloved of some South-East Asian
traders: “If you can’t smuggle, why
bother?” The old free port of Labuan,
for example, pretty well became a ghost
town as a result, and Sabah export
revenues declined considerably.
For Kuala Lumpur, in the new situ-
ation brought about by the latest
exchanges, the very basis upon which
diplomatic and other relations has
been founded has been eroded. Hence
their abrogation of the Anti-Smuggling
Pact without the six-month termination
period. The Filipinos, sticking to the
letter of the law even though they have
changed its substance, claim the six-
month period must operate and refused
at first to withdraw their Customs
officials. The Malaysians rescinded the
officials’ work permits and gave them
until the end of September to leave.
Last week the officials were still in
Sabah and the likelihood is for one
more incident to further degenerate
relations and the atmosphere.
This end has already been well
served by the demonstrations on both
sides since the suspension of relations.
The Malaysians were first off the mark.
One might theoretically argue that it
would have been better for Kuala
Lumpur to have broken relations com-
pletely and have then said firmly,.
“That’s that. The Filipinos can say or
shout what they like—we feel no com-
pulsion any longer to take any notice.
We will only take notice if they fail to
abide by their commitment to settle
the dispute peacefully, or if any con-
structive solutions are offered. Mean-
while we will get on with other pressing
problems.” It’s attractive but it is
theoretical. On the one hand, the
Malaysians did not go the whole hog
and break relations for fear that this
would have cost them some degree of
outside sympathy and support. On the
other, being unsure of the degree of
that support and aware that at a pinch
they might well be more dependent on
themselves than they would prefer, it
was necessary to take the opportunity
presented to whip up public feeling
and support. Hence the Alliance
encouraged or organised mass rallies
throughout the nation. Hence, too, as
an offshoot, the student demonstration
against the Philippine Embassy in
Kuala Lumpur, with the tearing down
and trampling of the Philippines flag—
and its natural reaction-producing
effect in Manila.
A week earlier, the Malaysian Prime
Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, had
counselled against such anti-Embassy
demonstrations, no doubt for this very
reason. It would be going too far to
say that the student demo was offici-
ally inspired. Nonetheless, traffic cops
allowed the scooter-riding students


through the town even with the traffic
lights against them, and in marked
contrast to the earlier pro-Czech demo
outside the Russian Embassy the riot
squad arrived after the 50-minute
demonstration was over. Once he got to
hear of it, the Tunku expressed his
regrets, but, of course, by that time the
flag-trampling photo had reached the
newspapers in Manila.
On the purely political level, what
the Philippines had done was, of course,
to present the Alliance with an oppor-
tunity. The ever more strident Filipino
espousal of their claim has in any case
helped, over the past year or so, to
paper over the cracks in East-West
Malaysian relations. Now even K.L.’s
bitterest opponent in East Malaysia,
ex-Chief Minister of Sarawak Stephen
Kalong Ningkan, has declared his sup-
port for the Federal Government on
this issue. Immediately, the latest
Filipino actions, such as the signing by
Marcos of the “annexation” Bill, have
presented the Alliance with an oppor-
tunity to head off other likely (and
largely communal) agitations. One can
almost be glad they have taken them.
Beyond this, it must be stressed that
a good deal of the anger is very real
and genuine as indeed it has every
reason to be. More important, if one
objects to the emotions now being
aroused (and which will make the
finding of any solution even more
impossible than it was previously), then
it would be as well to place part of the
blame well and truly where it belongs.
IF Britain, Australia, and New Zealand
had at any time in the past few weeks
sought to take some consistent and
determined diplomatic initiatives over
the dispute, then it would have been
possible to say to the Malaysians
“Look, we are going to support you
down the line on this one, but in return
please keep the public arousal down to
an unavoidable minimum so that things
don’t get out of hand.” Such initiatives
and support have not been forthcoming;
the dispute has got even further out of
hand.
Ironically, it did look for one happy
moment as if the United States was
going to take the initiative and that
moment has materially helped things
to further get out of hand in Manila.
On September 19, the State Depart-
ment official spokesman reiterated the
U.S. hopes for an amicable settlement
of the dispute and, in response to a
question, that U.S. recognition of
Malaysia, including Sabah, remained
as unqualified as when it was given in
1963.
All of which should have been quite
unexceptional except for the facts
that the question was asked on Septem-
ber 19, 1968, that the statement was
misreported as a change of U.S. policy,
and that American-Philippine relations
are as volatile as the Philippines itself.
Too late, the next day, the spokes-
man, Robert McCloskey, volunteered
that the U.S. adhered to its policy of
taking no position on territorial dis-
putes and hoped that the previous
statement “would not in any way impair
Congressional leaders and Foreign Secretary Narcisco Ramos (seated right) watch
Philippine President Marcos signing into law the Bill annexing Sabah
our relations with either or both
countries.” It already had.
For one thing, the Filipino Press and
politicians introvert as ever had
failed to perceive that the impact of
their legislation was to make the
“neutrals” less neutral. All the
embassies in K.L. are there because
those governments recognise Malaysia’s
sovereignty over Sabah. From the out-
cry that went up in Manila over the
U.S. “treachery,” it may safely be con-
cluded that the Filipinos had some-
how hoped that the mere passage of
their law declaring their sovereignty
would somehow change all that. It
hasn’t, of course, and even Spain
(whom the Filipinos have long thought
would support them over Sabah as a
quid pro quo for their support over
Gibraltar) has confirmed to the Mal-
aysian Foreign Ministry that they
recognise Malaysia as including Sabah.
If they had considered it worth it, all
the Malaysians need have done to
demonstrate to Manila how isolated it
was would have been, a la Sihanouk,
to request that each and every country
represented in K.L. confirm publicly
that it recognised Malaysia as including
Sabah.
Malaysia has chosen not to embarrass
its friends in their self-imposed silence.
But the Filipinos have reacted very
emotionally to the McCloskey statement
>— as is their wont and have not
been assuaged even by an aide-memoire
reaffirming the Americans’ “total im-
partiality” in the dispute. Perhaps the
overreaction is not so childish as it at
first seems, since the Americans have
once again been put very much on the
defensive, incapable of an effective
initiative. Similarly, the overreaction
has given some pseudo-nationalists a
field day with talk of having to “go
it alone,” nationalise the Anglo-Ameri-
can oil interests, declare a non-aligned
policy, and end the American alliance,
and the bases. While some Manila
columnists sensibly point out that the
whole affair illustrates that in the
Filipino-U.S. glass house there is little
room for throwing stones at the Anglo-
Malaysian one, it would seem as per-
tinent to point out that the whole
affair once again well illustrates the
incestuous nature of the Filipinos’ rela-
tions with their former colonisers, and
that Filipino politicians have a much
greater capacity for pressuring the
U.S. than the reverse.
At all events, the demonstrations in
Manila by students and others have
had three targets the British, the
Malaysian, and the American Em-
bassies. Going with the tide, as always,
President Marcos has termed the
British the chief opponent, but, adding
prudence to expedience, has stopped
short of going for broke (as some
extremists would like him to) and
including the Americans within his
attacks. He has merely expressed
“disappointment” at their stand, talked
of increased defence preparedness,
ordered manoeuvres in the south in
November, and said he will personally
lead Philippine forces if the country
is attacked. As a sign of the times, a
Press conference called to celebrate
his first 1000 days in office, “which was
expected to deal with the achievements
of the administration and the problems
of government,” turned out to be a
foru'm to discuss the Sabah issue.
If the Americans got too much play
in the Philippines, then at least Mr.
Hasluck can be grateful that his re-
marks at Singapore airport on his way
through to Europe got very little play
in Malaysia, though no doubt they
have had an unhappy impact in
Malaysian Government circles.
The Australian External Affairs
Minister denied that the Sabah dispute
would be a pressure for influencing
Australian defence planning, but ended
up seemingly indicating that such de-
fence planning might be of rather
limited usefulness to the Malaysians.
“If the present situation were to
develop into hostilities, and I don’t
believe it will develop, into hostilities,
we would, of course, be faced
with a new situation. But our interest
in the security of the Malaysian area
is an interest related to regional
security ... we would not get in-
volved in hostilities between two
friendly countries. I think the key to
it is that we are in friendly relations
with Malaysia and we are also in
friendly relations with the Philippines

. . . we declared at the Kuala Lumpur
conference a continuing interest in the
security of this area ... I don’t believe
there will be hostilities; if there were
hostilities we would not wish to be
involved; and there should be no
expectation on the part of anyone that
we would become involved. Of course,
all that is preceded by this big ‘if.’
We take at its face value the assurance
by President Marcos that this will be
settled without recourse to force. We
take at its face value and we assume
that Malaysia will not resort to force
unless in response to some attack.”
To be fair, as Mr. Hasluck himself
pointed out, he was being pressed hard,
and the above elongated quote is from
his various replies to various questions.
But, put against the fact that at no
stage did he in any way climb off the
neutral fence (“the attitude of the Aus-
tralian Government is that we are in
friendly relations with Malaysia. We
are also in friendly relations with the
Philippines”), to say, at least, that
Australia recognises that Sabah has
twice exercised self-determination in
Malaysia’s favor, then the impact
of his remarks is that of a rather dis-
tant ally, to say the very least. The
hard fact is that Malaysia and the
Philippines are in unfriendly relations.
Just as Western neutrality between
Nigeria and Biafra has been in practice
effective support for Nigeria, so neu-
trality between Malaysia and the Philip-
pines must in time come to be seen
in K.L. as de facto support for the
Philippines’, as yet, verbal and carto-
graphic aggression. Doubt can only be
compounded when, for example, the
Canberra correspondent of the London
“Financial Times” reports the Austra-
lian Government’s “decision not to sup-
port Malaysia in its dispute with the
Philippines over Sabah despite the fact
that Australia still has troops there for
supporting it against external attack.”
The report goes on to note that “this
is, of course, a break with Britain . , .”
which in turn only gives further point
to the Tory defence spokesman’s com-
ment in Sydney when reiterating his
Party’s willingness to halt British
withdrawal and suggesting “that Aus-
tralia should not do anything that
would make re-entry impossible.”
But something has been done. No
doubt the Sabah crisis comes at a most
convenient time from Canberra’s
decision-making point of view. But
then time and Asian events wait for no
government. At best, non-involvement,
when Australia is involved by virtue of
the past, would seem to have been
pushed to its outer limits. At worst, a
leading local politician who has always
chided me about Australia’s “cowardly
responses” to its environment would
seem to have got a gratuitous boost to
his convictions, and, understandably,
some converts as well. “It would dis-
tress us very much if any dispute
should break out between Malaysia
and the Philippines,” says Mr. Has-
luck. The trouble is, it has already
broken out, and the distress is not only
within but with Australia.


THE WEEK IN AMERICA
WARREN COURT JUDGED
Judge Fortas ...rejected as Chief
Justice
BEHIND THE FAILURE of President
Johnson to have his way in appointing
Abe Fortas as Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court lies widespread dis-
satisfaction in Congress and in conserva-
tive circles throughout the country with
recent decisions of the so-called
“Warren Court.”
Fortas, as a member of the Supreme
Court, has consistently voted with Chief
Justice Earl Warren and the liberal
majority of the Court. When Justice
Warren announced his wish to retire
last June, the President named Justice
Fortas to succeed him. However,
Republican Senators succeeded in
blocking the appointment by with-
holding necessary confirmation by the
Senate, and Fortas himself finally with-
drew his name from consideration for
the post. Republicans objected to the
President’s action in naming a Chief
Justice in the waning months of his
administration. They believed a new
President hopefully, Republican
candidate Richard Nixon should
have that right.
The effect of the Fortas rejection, it
was pointed out in Washington reports,
was likely to be a change in the tone
of future Court decisions. “The New
York Times” predicted a “pulling in
of judicial horns, a tendency to shy
away from the most controversial issues,
a reluctance to break new social, legal,
or economic ground.”
Seldom in history had a court so
profoundly affected American life as
the Warren Court in its decisions on
school segregation and in the general
area of civil liberties.
“In these areas the Court managed
to offend, outrage, or at least distress
conservatives,” “The Times” noted. “It
has provided a large political target for
two consecutive Republican presidential
candidates (Goldwater and Nixon), as
well as George Wallace.
“In the absence of clear evidence to
the contrary, the Court is now likely to
take the attitude that it, as well as Abe
Fortas and Lyndon Johnson, has been
rebuffed. With Congress having moved
sharply to the Right since the great
society days of 1965, with a Republi-
can President appearing more likely
every day, the third branqh of govern-
ment may well find it good policy to
fall in line.”
CATHOLICS SHED GUILT
AMERICAN CATHOLICS have been
caught up in guilt and conflict as they
move toward increasingly liberal atti-
tudes on birth control and marriage.
This was revealed by a poll of married
Catholics undertaken by the Urban
Life Institute of the University of San
Francisco, a Jesuit institution.
The study disclosed these prevailing
attitudes:
1. A large majority of Catholics (71
percent) approved the use of contra-
ceptives, but an even larger majority of
those using them are staying away from
the sacraments of the Church.
2. Two-thirds of Catholics, like two-
thirds of Protestants, are attempting to
limit the size of their families. But
Catholics fear that acting in conscience
against Church discipline on this issue
will “open a Pandora’s box” and
destroy Catholic unity.
3. Although half of all Catholics
agree that their Church had an unreal-
istically narrow view of marriage, 44
percent also agree that contraceptives
were likely to threaten the spirit of
self-sacrifice required of good Catholics.
Generally, the study found that
Catholics continued to be fiercely loyal
to their Church, even as they moved
toward the sexual attitudes of non-
Catholics.
“Catholics tend to think with the
Church and act with the secular
society,” the survey found.
Sixty-five percent of the Catholics
polled had used contraceptives at one
time or another in violation of Church
teaching. Sixty-two percent also
approved divorce, 53 percent approved
sterilisation, and 46 percent approved
abortion all proscribed by the
Church.
“Catholics are shedding a puritan-
flavored sexual morality,” the survey-
director, Hazel Firstman, concluded.
“My opinion is that the guilt and
ambivalence will soon be rid of. The
liberal attitudes will stay and grow.”
As for the rhythm method of birth
control, the only one approved by the
Church, 75 percent of those who had
used it said it did not work.
THE MOON I —SO WHAT?
AMERICA’S SPACE program has
concluded its first decade but has no
clear mandate for the future, observers
pointed out last week. The United
States has spent $44,000 million and has
accomplished many worthwhile things
in space. It is about to attempt a
manned lunar orbit and by 1970 hopes
to put a man on the moon.
NASA has conducted 234 major
launchings, 174 of which were clear
successes, including robot launchings on
the moon. There was no question that
the U.S. could compete with Russia in
space exploration, but there was no
general agreement, either, that the U.S.
should continue a major space program.
Dr. Ralph Lapp, nuclear physicist
and outspoken commentator on space
matters, has urged that the space pro-
gram be halved to about $2OOO million
annually, primarily by abandoning all
manned flights, and greater priority
given to basic scientific research and
near-in flights directly affecting the
“economy, security, and enhancement
of society on earth.” This would mean
greater use of space for communications
transmission, weather observations and
prediction, air and sea navigation, and
surveying with remote sensors the
Scheduled for the first manned flight
of the Apollo moonship this week are
astronauts Donn Eisele, Walter Schirra,
and Walter Cunningham. The space
program has already cost the U.S.
$44,000 million
earth’s agricultural, mineral, petroleum,
and water resources.
On the other hand, space scientists
are pressing for further exploration of
the solar system, with Venus and Mars
to be given top priority. “We must go
for the most important exciting scientific
facts awaiting discovery at the distant
new worlds,” says Dr. Bruce Murray,
of the California Institute of
Technology.
“When we get to the moon, there
will be a big letdown,” Rocco Petrone,
Director of Apollo operations, com-
mented recently. “There will be a
parade up Broadway, but what will we
do next? No one seems to know. We
have no firm plans. The public doesn’t
seem to know what it wants out of
space. We have to start thinking now
how we’ll exploit what we are learn-
ing with Apollo, not just settle for a
landing on the moon.”
SCHOOLED IN CRIME
FRESH FOR THE opening of the new-
term classes, the University of Cali-
fornia’s branch at Berkeley had a bright
new controversy. At the centre of the


storm is the wholly unlikely figure Mr.
Eldridge Cleaver, the so-called Minister
of Information of the Black Panthers
and one of the most articulate of the
new militant Negro leaders demanding
instant remedy for past wrongs. Mr.
Cleaver is a tall Negro of 33. Leather-
jacketed and bearded, he speaks volubly
and ably wherever asked. Communica-
tion with whites rather than with-
drawal is Mr. Cleaver’s method. He
had been scheduled to speak ten times
at Berkeley this semester as one of 12
lecturers (the others were to give one
talk each) in an experimental progra'm
designed by students and professors to
provide academic work on current social
problems. These classes were organised
four years ago, after the Free Speech
Movement had rebelled against an ivory
tower university life isolated from real
problems.
Unfortunately, Mr. Cleaver, besides
being usually abusive toward white
society, is also a man with a criminal
record; he has spent seven years in
prison and fresh charges of assault upon
the police and attempted murder are
hanging over his head. Many Cali-
fornians, including Governor Ronald
Reagan, a minority of the university’s
regents, and many State legislators, are
angry that a man with such a back-
ground should be tolerated on a lec-
turer’s platform, even though there
would be discussion, led by a professor,
after each of Mr. Cleaver’s talks.
To students, a criminal record is
irrelevant. The president of the Berke-
ley Association of Students has put this
view: “Cleaver is the most articulate
spokesman available. He can bring to
students knowledge of the typical black
experience. Black and white relations
constitute the most important domestic
issue confronting this country today,
and if students can’t discuss it, what,
really, is a university all about?”
When Governor Reagan, ex-officio 1 a
university regent, led demands that
Mr. Cleaver be barred completely, a
compromise plan was proposed instead
by the university’s new president, Dr.
Charles Hitch, and the Board of Regents
bravely approved it. Instead of banning
Mr. Cleaver by name, the plan permits
one lecture a year in any course by any
individual not a member of the staff.
Mr. Cleaver accepts the compromise.
DESIGNING HEARTS
ALTHOUGH THE world-wide series
of heart transplants has captured public
attention, a potentially more dramatic
effort is gaining momentum the drive
to develop a successful artificial heart.
Thousands of such hearts have been
installed in experimental animals,
mostly dogs. Thirty-five of the deyices
have been used on human patients,
about half of whom survived and even-
tually went home. The U.S. Public
Health Service National Heart Institute
has launched a nation-wide artificial-
heart program to underwrite the efforts
of more than 100 research teams.
More than $2O million has been ex-
pended thus far in the effort to develop
a satisfactory artificial heart. Two
basic types of artificial hearts have
been developed. One is the booster
heart—the heart helper. It does not
replace the natural heart, but takes over
part of its load for a while, as the
organ struggles to repair itself.
The other is a total replacement
heart—the ideal type. Hundreds of
these have been installed in animals and
have kept them alive for varying
periods. But such devices are still not
ready for use in human beings. Among
other things, they form blood clots and
until this problem is solved they will
not be implanted in humans. But
researchers are convinced this is simply
a design problem which will eventually
be solved.
THE GHETTO TIME-RACE
LAME DUCK he may be, but Presi-
dent Johnson still has his sense of
occasion. When he signed this year’s
Housing Act, he did it before the
breathtaking building designed for the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development in the shape of two great
back-to-back semicircles. This is the
Department’s first home; its employees
President Johnson ...a notable
victory in his plan to wipe out
slums
had been scattered through 20 separate
buildings, two of them so run-down
that they violated the Washington
housing code. But more was being cele-
brated than the rehousing of HUD.
The $5.3 billion authorisation for the
next three years, a notable victory for
the President, is the first instalment on
his ten-year plan to wipe out America’s
slums.
The Bill’s easy passage through Con-
gress suggests that the riots of the past
three years and the warnings of two
presidential commissions have brought
the country to a sober realisation that
slums can be tolerated no longer. Presi-
dent Johnson’s successors must report
progress each year toward the goal of
a decent home for every family by
1978.
The official housing experts estimate
that people are living in about two mil-
lion houses which are beyond saving;
that two million more will decline into
this category by 1978; and that public
help is needed to bring a further two
million up to American standards. But
this is not all. In the next decade there
will be 13 million more families need-
ing homes.
For families who want to buy
houses, whose incomes are between
$3OOO and $6500 a year—a bit above
the poverty level and who agree to
pay 20 percent of their income for
housing, the Federal Government will
make up the difference between this
sum and the amount needed for pay-
ments (including rates and insurance)
on a mortgage of up to $15,000. But
the buyer must always pay at least the
equivalent of the interest on a mortgage
granted at one percent. A similar
subsidy will be paid to keep rents
down, though families must use 25
percent of their income for housing.
Whether it is wise to encourage
people with incomes near the poverty
line to become householders can be dis-
puted; the families will have to be
chosen carefully. And the home-
ownership scheme is likely to be expen-
sive to the Government in terms of the
amount of housing it provides. But
politically the Administration felt that
it could not let the Republicans, who
first proposed this idea, ride off with
all the credit. At least Congress contem-
plates insurance which will prevent poor
people who lose their jobs from losing
their homes as well.
If Congress puts its shoulder to the
financial wheel, there may indeed be a
decent home for most American
families, if not in a decade, in \2
years or so.
But how far will this break up the
ghetto and move the 12 percent of
Americans who are non-white into the
main stream? Well-off Negroes will find
their way increasingly into white com-
munities, but where will poor ones go?
No one can be sure, but most of the
housing to be rehabilitated is in the
present slums. Moreover, the expecta-
tion is that most housing for- rent will
go up in the centres of cities which
are becoming blacker with every year.
A good deal depends, of course, on
where sites become available and how
vigorously local housing authorities and
private developers seek them in white
communities. In turn, this depends on
whether the prejudices of blue-collar
Americans (who are the most intimately
affected) can be softened or whether
they will be fortified by racist poli-
ticians.
There is another argument. The ideal
toward which America is striving is-
that people should have a say in the
decisions which affect them most
closely; this means decentralised con-
trol, sensitive regard for local
preferences, and, one hopes, for stan-
dards of design and quality. America,
after all, is not a compact, homo-
geneous, small country; it is a vast con-
tinent of 200 million people with vary-
ing backgrounds, tastes, aspirations, and
capabilities. How to provide them wfith
a say in their future may well pose the
greatest challenge of the coming decade.
Or so they say at HUD. The question
is whether the ghettoes will wait.

POLITICS AND THE
THE COUNTRY PARTY has 21
members of the House of Representa-
tives, six Senators, regional strength,
half a million voters, and John
McEwen. It also has troubles. The
peasantry is restless. The troubles are
both external and internal. The exter-
nal trouble is long standing, the internal
trouble, of recent vintage.
The external trouble is due to the
fact that the Country Party support
is local. It draws its strength from
farmers and primary producers and
their families, whom it was formed to
serve. Basically the Country Party has
operated as a pressure group. At no
period in its 50-year history has it
federally had the electoral backing to
form a government in its own right.
Federally it was shaped by the late
Sir Earle Page, a confused talker but
clear thinker, who was its leader from
1921 until 1939 when he resigned the
leadership after an unsuccessful attempt
to deprive Sir Robert (then Mr.)
Menzies of the Prime Ministership left
vacant by the death of Prime Minister
J. A. Lyons shortly before the out-
break of World War 11. Under Page’s
leadership the Country Party stood for
low tariffs, the protection of country
interests against protection-seeking city-
based manufacturers, and the predomi-
nance of the farmer as the real source
of Australia’s wealth. A man who
understood power and its manipulation,
Page bequeathed to his successors a
pattern of using the CP’s position as
the balance of power in the House of
Representatives between Labor and
urban-based majority non-Labor group-
ings as a means of extracting from
city interests concessions for their
country cousins.
But even before Page resigned the
CP leadership, the population drift
from the country to metropolitan areas
had begun. This drift intensified dur-
ing and after World War II as primary
industry became more efficient, more
highly mechanised, and grew to de-
pend less and less upon a labor force.
The CP’s electoral base contracted with
accelerating speed, with the Party’s
decentralisation proposals unable to
cope with the economic pressures and
social forces which produced the
exodus from the countryside to the
cities.
The CP fought desperately to retain
its electoral support, even though in its
attempt to retain it in the regions
where it needed this support, it sacri-
ficed the long-term interests of its loyal
backers. The dairying community has
always backed the CP. Though a high
proportion of the workers in dairying,
proprietors and laborers alike, was
condemned to an underprivileged
status, the CP successfully resisted for
years the proposition that the dairying
industry should be reconstructed. Only
two weeks ago did Primary Industry
Minister Doug Anthony, McEwen’s
first lieutenant, as CP Deputy Leader,
indicate that the CP was at last pre-
pared to face up to a dairying industry
reconstruction. Anthony conceded de-
feat. “The Country Party is not pre-
pared to . . . perpetuate its own politi-
cal strength by keeping marginal dairy-
farmers on their land in near peasant
farming conditions,” he said.
Internally, the CP’s troubles are
largely due to the reaction of John
McEwen to the external problems and
the steps he took in an attempt to solve
them. McEwen took over the Country
Party leadership in . 1958 when the
former CP leader, Sir Arthur Fadden,
retired from Parliament after a record-
breaking term as Co’mmonwealth
Treasurer. As an anonymous but per-
ceptive commentator has said in “The
Country Party (its) Fortunes and
Options,” a recent “Current Affairs
Bulletin”: “Loyalty to the leader is as
characteristic of the (CP) parlia-
mentarians as of the rank-and-file out-
side Parliament, and the Country
Party’s leaders have accordingly had a
great deal of freedom in which to
manoeuvre, far more than any leader of
the ALP and more than most of their
Liberal counterparts.” It is, to a con-
siderable degree, the manoeuvrings of
McEwen, as leader, that have produced
the CP’s current internal troubles.
Aloof, dignified as a highland laird,
implacable, McEwen is probably the
largest figure currently operating in the
Commonwealth parliamentary arena.
By some extraordinary process, he has
built up the public image of a man
who is detached, judicial, and serene.
Yet his career is one of turbulence
and discord. He has fought with every
Country Party leader under whom he

has served, from Page to Archie Cam-
eron, whose brief two-year reign as
leader he helped to terminate, to
Fadden, with whom he seems still at
daggers drawn despite Fadden’s decade
of absence from the Federal Parliament.
Menzies contained him, but that is all.
When Menzies’ fortunes seemed on the
downgrade after the electoral setback
of 1961, after which Menzies’ Govern-
ment operated for two exciting perilous
years on a floor majority of one in the
House of Representatives, McEwen
clearly made a bid to replace Menzies
as Prime Minister. Shortly before
Harold Holt, Menzies’ successor in the
Prime Ministership, disappeared in the
sea off Cheviot Beach, McEwen had
a confrontation with him on the Gov-
ernment’s decision not to devalue the
Australian dollar in sympathy with
sterling, a confrontation that involved
the future of the Liberal-CP partner-
ship in the Coalition Government.
Thinking big and ahead, as he always
does, McEwen was not the type of man
to be satisfied with being the leader
of a Party which was electorally eroding
and faced an uncertain future.
Two years before Fadden retired,
McEwen started his preparations for
the situation that would be created by
Fadden’s exit. Fadden had been Treas-
urer since 1949, taking over that key
economic post without Liberal protest,
in the Liberal-CP honeymoon period
that followed the heady and over-
whelming “downing” of the Chifley
Labor Government at the 1949 elec-

lions. McEwen, as Fadden’s Deputy,
was Minister for Commerce and Agri-
culture. Between them they dominated
Coalition economic policy to the point
that in 1951 they were able to secure
rejection of a Liberal-sponsored move
to restore the Australian pound to
parity with sterling.
McEwen realised that when Fadden
retired the CP must lose control of the
Treasury. So in 1956 McEwen per-
suaded the Government into creating
the Trade Department, which would
operate under his ministerial control.
The new department took in the func-
tions of his old department, which
would leave him still in policy control
of all primary production matters. But
added to it were other functions. It
became responsible for overseas trade,
broad shipping policy, and tariff mak-
ing. It was given a status that enabled
it to intrude into administrative areas
that were formerly either the preserve
or under the dominance of the Treasury.
Because of the free-trade traditions
of the Country Party, a coalition had
always been reluctant to place either
tariff policy or any aspect of it under
CP authority. McEwen became the first
CP Minister in Australian political
history with authority over the financial
well-being of the manufacturing section
of the Australian economy.
For a while, even after Fadden
retired, McEwen was inhibited. He saw
the possibility of rising to the Prime
Ministership over the discarded political
body of Robert Menzies. But by 1962,
Menzies, every bit as guileful and
resourceful as McEwen, had restored
his political prestige and was working to
see that Holt, not McEwen, would be
his successor when he retired.
In 1962 came a watershed. An
electoral redistribution was proposed.
The CP did not like it. Under it they
would lose heavily. McEwen was faced
with the alternative of pursuing the
hope of becoming Prime Minister a
faint hope due to the manner in
which Menzies had reasserted his politi-
cal supremacy or consolidating his
dominance over his CP parliamentary
followers. A realist, he abandoned his
prime-ministerial ambitions and led the
CP opposition to the redistribution.
From that point on he appeared to
concentrate on leaving as his political
monument an enlarged, more viable
Country Party, which, through an
alliance with the manufacturers, would
have a broadening electoral base that
would make it a permanent and
possibly larger feature of the Aus-
tralian political landscape.
But he had to proceed cautiously.
Deeply ingrained in the CP was sus-
picion of the manner in which tariffs
added to primary producers’ costs. He
had simultaneously to persuade the
Country Party that he was appreciative
that the domestic costs of primary
producers, who had to export their
products in the face of world competi-
tion, should not be unduly inflated by
too lavish tariff protection, and convince
manufacturers that he recognised their
need for, and would ensure that they
received, protection from cheaper pro-
duced foreign goods.
It was quite a nerve-racking exercise,
one that required strong nerves, iron
determination, and all McEwen’s
indomitable self-confidence.
McEwen sought to resolve his prob-
lem of appealing to manufacturers while
holding on to the Country Party’s elec-
toral supporters by adding a social
content to tariff-making. He developed
the theme that Australian development
could flow only from a proper policy
of protecting Australian industry.
He suggested that without such pro-
tection Australia could not continue the
immigration program which had
brought over 1,500,000 people to Aus-
tralia in the postwar years; population
would stagnate or diminish because of
workers moving to countries that pro-
tected their workforce; Australia’s own
workers were Australian farmers’ best
customers. The great bulk of the Aus-
tralian workforce found employment
behind the shelter of adequate tariffs.
Speaking on the Customs Tariff Bill
in the House of Representatives on
March 16, 1967, he went even further.
Even though the CP’s revised policy,


issue of which he had authorised him-
self in 1966, insisted that industries
should not be given tariff protection
unless they met the requirement of
efficiency, McEwen rejected the propo-
sition that because an industry did not
employ a great number of people and
because there were plenty of jobs avail-
able outside the industry, it should be
“folded up” if it were not as efficient
as the Government or the community
would like it to be.
In this necessity to maintain a dual
approach one to keep his CP voters
on side and the other to keep the manu-
facturers on side lies the explanation
for the almost irrational way in which
McEwen pursued his disagreements,
first against BIG, an electorally ineffec-
tive group of wealthy wool producers
which objected to the allegedly adverse
effect of his tariff policies upon the wool
industry, and against Canberra jour-
nalist Max Newton. Newton got
involved in McEwen’s feud with
Treasurer William McMahon during
the leadership struggle which followed
Holt’s death and the elevation of John
Gorton to Liberal leadership and the
Prime Ministership.
McEwen could not afford to allow
the anti-tariff views, held by BIG and
publicised by Newton, to be considered
dispassionately. He knew that they
would have an appeal to his CP fol-
lowers, steeped in anti-tariff traditions.
Brilliantly, he diverted attention from
the opinions of the attackers by attack-
ing not the opinions of the attackers
but the attackers themselves. BIG
became “a group, unseen and unknown
its members faceless and nameless
but very real indeed —very rich, indeed,
and very reckless in misrepresentation.”
Newton, who ran a tariff information
service for the Japanese Trade Centre
in Sydney, became a “paid agent for
foreign interests.”
But even with McEwen’s dominance
he could not on occasions prevent his
followers reverting to the long-held CP
attitudes, and sounding on occasions as
though they were practising members
of BIG or Newton disciples.
McEwen has been grooming two
young men to succeed him in the
Country Party leadership when he de-
cides to retire. One of them is Doug
Anthony, 38, the other is the Minister
for Shipping and Transport, lan Sin-
clair, also 38. I have not detected
McEwen favoring one more than the
other, though the legend is that
McEwen himself would prefer Sinclair
as the future leader while the CP par-
liamentarians would prefer Anthony as
“more in the CP tradition.”
Anthony was certainly in the CP
tradition when he told the Farm
Writers and Broadcasters’ Club in Syd-
ney on November 24, 1967, that “the
future of this country . . . depends
on this nation being a supplier of rela-
tively cheap food, fibre, and minerals.
And there is no use saying that we
have a really great future in anything
else, because we haven’t the workforce
and we haven’t got the throughput of
Minister for
Territories, Mr.
Barnes, retains
the rural image
of the Country
Party
factories to have the same advantages
that other countries have.”
In response to a question, “How are
we going to get people to realise that
the industrial section is trying to kill
the rural industries?” Anthony could
have been a spokesman for BIG when
he replied, “I don’t think there is
enough awareness . . . this message . . .
just goes over their heads.”
An outburst like this, from a young
man who can only be described as
McEwen-trained, must have made
McEwen realise how his policy of re-
educating the CP into an appreciation
of his concept of the shape of Aus-
tralia’s development has had only
limited success. He could hold the line
only while the CP was under the in-
fluence of his dominant personality.
And to add further to his chagrin came
a suggestion from an official spokes-
man for the manufacturers that the
manufacturers’ loyalty as yet was per-
sonal to him and not shared by the CP.
The President of the Associated Cham-
bers of Manufactures, Mr. W. W.
Pettingell, described Anthony’s
philosophy as “narrow and outdated.”
It would make Anthony “completely
unacceptable to manufacturers as
McEwen’s successor. We would recom-
mend that Mr. Anthony study the
philosophy of Mr. McEwen,” commen-
ted Mr. Pettingell, acidly.
But, despite everything, McEwen was
holding the line successfully when the
wheat stabilisation scheme came up for
review.
To a considerable extent, McEwen
has been able to hold his CP followers
while simultaneously building up his
alliance with the manufacturers by tell-
ing the primary producers that, while a
seeming cost burden was being put on
the farms by his tariff policies, they
were getting offsetting compensations.
The McEwen approach, designed to
keep his voters loyal, is contained in a
speech McEwen made at Rochester,
Victoria, a dairying district, on October
7, 1966. McEwen acknowledged that
his policies were adding to farm costs.
He said: “The more we become
efficient, the fewer farm workers we
need, so we in the farm industries con-
tribute nothing to the creation of
130,000 new jobs a year. Not only do
we contribute nothing, we’re employing
less labor. So our natural-born and our
migrants, by and large, must get jobs
other than on farms. They get them in
factories, transport, and all the service
industries that then follow. The policies
which encourage the factories, the very
policies themselves, put a burden of cost
on the farm. I’ve never run away fro'm
saying that I am supporting policies
which tend to put a burden of cost on
the farm. But I then follow and say that
if this is the proper thing to do, it is
a proper thing for Government to
offset those cost increases. We do offset
them. Dairying is one of the industries
in this district. As a Government, we
have already paid $500,000,000 an
enormous amount of money from the
Commonwealth Treasury to subsidise
butter and cheese production.”
That was a powerful argument. It
told the primary producers that what
they lost on the swings of tariff protec-
tion to secondary industry that in
McEwen’s words, “might not be as
efficient as the Government or the
community would like it to be” they
made up on the swings of Government
assistance.
But then came the revised wheat
stabilisation scheme, and Don Maisey.
Maisey, 53, is CP MHR for Moore, in
Western Australia. He is a former
member of the Wheat Board and
acknowledged as an authority through-
out the CP on wheat problems. He is
a tough, intractable character, as
implacable as McEwen himself, and a
man who never had much reverence
for McEwen and who has grown
increasingly irreverent and sceptical

about both McEwen and McEwen’s
policies.
Maisey did not like the wheat stabi-
lisation proposals, for which Anthony
as Minister for Primary Production car-
ries the formal responsibility, though
McEwen is unmistakably the architect.
Maisey did not like the likelihood that
wheatgrowers in the future will get less
for their product in a period of rising
costs a situation which wrecks com-
pletely McEwen’s assertion that, though
his policies impose cost burdens on
primary producers, they get these costs
offset by Government action. Nor did
Maisey like the fact that the scheme
provided for a higher home-consump-
tion price for wheat, which would add
another cost factor on to other sections
of primary industry, and would create
further price pressures by adding to
the cost of bread, eggs, and dairy pro-
ducts for workers in secondary industry.
Maisey’s viewpoint has attracted sup-
porters within the CP Parliamentary
Party, breaking for the first time for
years the CP front of parliamentary
solidarity. lan Pettit, N.S.W., and
Robert King, Victoria, have complained
publicly about the wheatgrowers being
the first section of the Australian com-
munity to have their incomes reduced
by statute, which, according to them, is
what will happen after the new wheat
stabilisation scheme becomes operative.
Other CP Members have revealed their
uneasiness about the shape of things to
come. Country Party Whip Winton
Turnbull, a mild-mannered, polite man,
who nevertheless can turn as stubborn
as a Mallee bull when he thinks some-
one is trying to put something over him,
has described Anthony, with unusual
acidity, as “just a messenger boy run-
ning backwards and forwards to Cabi-
net.” Actually, Turnbull is being a bit
unfair to Anthony and a bit inaccurate.
Anthony is not Cabinet’s errand boy;
he is McEwen’s. McEwen runs the
Country Party farm. Anthony and his
four fellow Country Party Ministers, lan
Sinclair, C. E. (“Ced”) Barnes (Exter-
nal Territories), Senator Colin
McKellar (Repatriation), and Peter
Nixon (Interior), merely work on the
property. Anthony’s responsibility for
the wheat stabilisation scheme is only
nominal. Nothing happens in the
Country Party without McEwen’s sanc-
tion.
Not that Maisey is going to get any-
where on the wheat stabilisation
scheme. Prime Minister John Gorton
is a McEwen admirer. He is backing
up his CP colleagues. He has already
told wheatgrowers so. He has also
praised Anthony’s courage in backing
up McEwen and adhering to the wheat
stabilisation proposals. Gorton did this
semi-publicly at a meeting of the
Government Parties.
But the real difficulty for McEwen
is that the restiveness over wheat
and the Government’s intention an-
nounced by Anthony to persevere with
reconstruction of the dairying industry
could attract CP attention to the
wider question of how McEwen’s
policies are adding to farm costs. In
view of what is happening with wheat
and dairying it could lead CP suppor-
ters to question the wisdom of
McEwen’s policies as far as the CP’s
narrower interests are concerned.
It was relatively easy for McEwen
to proceed unchallenged on his course
of re-educating his Party into the belief
that manufacturers and primary pro-
ducers’ interests were both compatible
and reconcilable while things were go-
ing smoothly. But the fact of the matter
is that events have overtaken both
McEwen and the Country Party. While
there was a discernible gap between
production costs and the price secured
for their products, the primary pro-
ducers could afford to be reasonably
philosophical.
When wool producers complained
and their complaints increased per-
ceptibly when the Committee of Eco-
nomic Inquiry confirmed that an
“indiscriminate” tariff policy had added,
and would add, considerably to wool
producers’ cost burdens—they could be
dismissed, as individuals protecting
their wealth rather than genuine
sufferers. They represented numerically
only a minority of primary producers,
and most of them voted Liberal,
anyway.
But devaluation of sterling last year
changed that situation. Britain was still
a sufficiently major customer of Aus-
tralia for devaluation to affect primary
industries adversely. Returns went
down while costs continued to climb.
Now, with the wheat industry likely to
lose income, while simultaneously the
higher home-consumption price for
wheat raises costs for dependent in-
dustries, such as the poultry and dairy-
ing, and with the subsidy for the
dairying industry likely to be cut back,
the McEwen line that higher costs due
to the policies he supports are offset
by compensatory Government handouts
is not likely to be as convincing.
Even aside from whatever erosion
internal wrangling produces and the
wrangles show promise of growing in
intensity and bitterness the CP elec-
torally faces factors that are outside
its control.
Though McEwen extracted from
Menzies and the Liberals an amend-
ment to the electoral law which pro-
duced a loading in favor of country
electorates (this has provoked outsized
screams from the Labor Party) the CP
lost another seat Lawson in N.S.W.
under the redistribution proposals
now before the Parliament. The lapse
of time and future redistributions
promise to take this reduction in the
number of country seats still further,
thereby threatening increasingly the
CP’s electoral base.
Labor is also starting to take organ-
ised action against the CP. In the past,
CP candidates have survived in some
electorates on Labor preferences. The
Victorian ALP has now decided that
in three-cornered contests its prefer-
ences will go as a matter of settled
policy to the Liberals. Long-term
effect of this could be to reduce the
number of CP seats in Victoria. West-
ern Australia and Queensland, where
Labor preferences are often useful to a
CP candidate, are expected to adopt a
similar policy. In other words, Labor
will be assisting the Liberals to eradi-
cate the CP as a parliamentary force.
In the long run, this must have an
effect upon the CP’s long-term parlia-
mentary prospects. As the CP declines,
the possibility of the Liberals increasing
their parliamentary numbers improves.
The Liberals’ capacity to govern in
their own right and without reliance
upon Country Party support must be
enhanced.
Both the CP as a Party, and
McEwen, have problems on their hands.
The peasantry is restive, and Don
Maisey could easily turn into a mod-
ern Wat Tyler.


THE BRINKMANSHIP
WITHIN THE PAST year tradition-
ally staid international monetary mar-
kets have been rocked twice, first by
devaluation of the British pound, and
then by a gold panic. For the first time
since the 19305, world attention has
riveted on the esoteric centres of finance
in London, Zurich, Geneva, and Paris,
with the pulse of the world’s economy
being measured daily by foreign ex-
change rates and gold prices. Lately
all eyes have been on the annual meet-
ing of the International Monetary
Fund, held in Washington from Sep-
tember 30 to October 4, where the
decisions taken could affect the lives
of U.S. workers, French peasants, and
Vietnam combatants alike. For behind
the dry statistics and apparently mys-
terious workings of the intenational
monetary system major forces are en-
gaged in a great power struggle.
To shed light on the operation of
these forces in response to recent
events, as well as to suggest prospects
for the future, they can be examined
in these three ways: (1) The United
States and continental Europe are en-
gaged in a titanic subsurface economic
struggle, primarily over the role of
U.S. investment in Europe. The out-
come may determine whether Europe
can survive as an independent entity.
(2) The respective roles of gold and
the dollar in the world economy are
at the focus of this struggle. (3) The
mechanics of the struggle are such that
its resolution may be determined in the
end, not by the nations involved but
by individual speculators on both sides
of the Atlantic, with potentially disas-
trous consequences for all.
First, some historical background. In
the 19305, as a result of the Great
Depression and the spectre of war, capi-
tal fled from Europe to the United
States, which built up an enormous
gold hoard. This stock of gold rose from
$lO billion in 1935 to $22 billion in
1940, at which time the United States
held the bulk of the world’s gold.
World War II physically destroyed the
economies of all the European powers
but Great Britain, which it vastly weak-
ened. At the same time, the economic
and financial power of the United
States was greatly increased; its gold
holdings reached a peak of $25 billion
in 1949. The Marshall Plan helped to
rebuild Europe, but partly at the price
of increasing U.S. penetration of
Europe and former European colonies.
The book value (basically the original
cost) of direct U.S. foreign private
investment rose world - wide from
$l2 billion in 1950 the order of
magnitude at which U.S. overseas in-
vestment stood in the 1930 s to
$33 billion in 1960, and more than
$6O billion today. And everyone agrees
that these figures greatly understate the
real value of the assets the United
States has accumulated. (As an
example, the whole of U.S. Middle
Eastern oil investment is carried on the
books at $1.5 billion, but this figure
excludes the value of the 150 billion
barrels of oil proven to be in the
ground; that is one reason why the
reported rate of return on Middle East
investment is more than 50 percent
per year.) Thus, what these figures
really show is not the absolute level of
investment but its rapid rate of growth.
At the same time, in almost every
year since 1950, the United States has
Federal Treasurer, Mr. McMahon
(right), meets British Ministers at the
opening of the Commonwealth Finance
Ministers’ conference in London
had a balance of payments deficit. This
means that, including its foreign in-
vestment overseas, the U.S. has spent
more abroad than foreigners have spent
in the U.S. How has this deficit been
paid for? The answer, of course, is to
be found in the historic willingness of
foreigners to accept dollars or gold in
exchange for giving the United States
real economic assets. Up until 1957,
foreigners were willing to take dollars,
and the U.S. gold hoard stayed at
about the 1950 level. From 1958 on,
however, foreigners began increasingly
to demand gold, and the U.S. gold
stock has shrunk to about $lO billion.
Why the shift? One reason is that,
despite current U.S. assertions to the
contrary, gold is still the only univers-
ally accepted currency. The ultimate
strength of the dollar as an international
currency lay in the huge supply of
gold available to reclaim any unwanted
dollars presented at the U.S. bank win-
dow. As the supply of dollars in the
hands of foreigners grew increasingly
larger than the value of U.S. holdings
in gold, the creditors naturally became
increasingly suspicious of U.S. ability
to pay their claims in the only cur-
rency they really trusted.
A second reason was the drive, par-
ticularly by the French, under de Gaulle,
to slow down U.S. investment in
Europe. This investment has risen from
$2 billion in 1950 to $6 billion in 1960
and to $2O billion today. The theory was
that if Europe demanded gold, the
United States would have to curb its
dollar outflow in order to maintain
its gold stock, and ultimately would
have to cut its foreign investment.
The French Foreign Trade Secretary,
on visiting the United States, presented
the position as follows:
“We could permit a much larger
American presence in our economy as
the Germans are doing, and it would
be easy politically. There would be
more jobs and faster growth. But to
be politically responsible to the gener-
ations to come we have to see that these
generations have the weapons to defend
themselves —economic weapons. If we
did nothing, in a few years we would
have the same problems as Latin
America has. The idea has taken hold
in American financial circles that the
way to take care of the United States’
favorable balance of trade with France
is to export capital. This is a policy
whereby we could become a 'medium-
developed country in the future. This
explains our attitude on gold. We don’t
want to take America’s gold, we just
want to stop the overabundance of
American capital in France.” (“Wall
Street Journal,” February 24, 1966;
emphasis added.)
The United States on the other hand
has strenuously resisted these efforts to
curb its overseas investment. The whole
history of the approach to reducing
the U.S. balance of payments deficit—
from the first attempts to decrease
loans to foreigners down to recent talk
of taxes to reduce overseas travel
shows the desire to find other solutions,
short of seriously constraining the
growth of U.S. foreign investment.
On a theoretical plane it has some-
times been argued that there is nothing
inherently wrong with the deficit. This
view was well stated by three leading
U.S. economists, Emile Despres, Charles
Kindleberger, and Walter Salant, writ-
ing in the London “Economist” (which
dubbed their position “the new nation-
alism”):
“The dollar is the world’s standard
of value . . . An annual growth in
Europe’s dollar holdings averaging, per-
haps, $1.5 to $2 billion a year or
perhaps more for a long time is normal
expansion for a bank the size of the
United States with a fast-growing world
as its body of customers.” (February 5,
1966; emphasis added.)
Now, if this whole struggle were


What it's all about
merely between the United States and
France (or between the United States
and a de Gaulle obsessed with power,
as it is sometimes portrayed), then it
would have only fleeting historical
interest, thanks to the United States’
far greater power. But it seems clear
that de Gaulle and the French do not
stand alone, that they have strong, if
quiet, support in continental Europe. In
the arena of money, actions speak
louder than words. Back in the late
1950 s most of the continental govern-
ments held little gold. Today, West
Germany and France each hold about
$4.5 billion worth of the metal, with the
latest count putting West Germany
slightly ahead, the Benelux countries
have $3 billion, and Italy $2.5 billion.
Thus the Common Market countries to-
gether hold about $l5 billion in gold,
w'hich accounts for almost two-thirds of
their international reserves. Lest one
think that this merely reflects nervous-
ness on the part of all foreign govern-
ments as to the redeemability of the
dollar, note the proportion of gold to
total reserves for the rest of the world is
reversed. The United States’ best cus-
tomer on the basis of holding dollars
is Japan, which keeps less than one-
fifth of its reserves in gold. Japan,
however, restricts U.S. investment.
To sum up, in the past ten years the
increasingly dominant factor in U.S.-
European economic relations has been
the growth of U.S. foreign investment.
It has caused the dollar outflow which,
as these dollars are cashed for gold,
has led to the gold crisis in the United
States. Where do we go from here?
The situation is now critical and some-
thing must give.
To see what is likely to give one
has to examine the balance between
two basic sets of economic forces. The
first set is the real economic forces,
involving the control of production
and profits. The second set # is the
financial forces, involving control of
money and gold.
As to the real forces, the most im-
portant fact of current international
economy is the enormous U.S. position
overseas. The view from Europe on
this situation has been dramatically
summarised in a recent European best-
seller, “The American Challenge,” by
Jean Servan-Schreiber: “In 15 years the
third industrial power, after the United
States and the U.S.S.R., could well be
not Europe but American industry in
Europe.” This is true despite the fact
that less than ten percent of European
industry is now controlled by U.S.
corporations. While still relatively small,
this investment is growing much more
rapidly than the indigenous investment.
Also, U.S. investment is heavily con-
centrated in the key growth industries
computers, electronics, chemicals,
etc. These are not only the high-profit
industries but also the high-technology
industries that all agree will dominate
the future economy. Moreover, the
simple arithmetic of foreign investment
must also disturb Europeans: with U.S.
investment in Europe earning 10 to
15 percent per year, while the Euro-
pean economies grow at perhaps 5 per-
cent a year, the United States could
steadily increase its share of industry
in Europe merely by ploughing back
profits made in Europe. Using European
labor and European markets, American
industry could grow' tow'ard domination
The opening of the Commonwealth
finance conference, a preliminary to
this week’s meeting of the International
Monetary Fund in Washington
of Europe without sending an additional
dollar from the United States.
For the same reasons high profits
plus great growth potential U.S. in-
dustry has a strong interest in increas-
ing its European investment. In addi-
tion, U.S. industry wants a heavy in-
vestment in Europe in order to profit
from its investment in raw-material
production in the underdeveloped
world. For example, there would be
far less value to the enormous U.S. oil
investment in the Middle East if that
oil couldn’t be pumped into European
refineries or marketed to European
customers, as is now done on such a
huge scale.
While many Europeans have pointed
out the dangers of U.S. domination of
their industry, they face for several
reasons an apparent dilemma in deal-
ing with it. For one thing, the separate
European nations are too small to
generate consistently companies as large
and powerful as those that have grown
up in the vast U.S. market and are
now invading Europe. Size gives major
advantages, not only by allowing low-
cost mass production but also by pro-
viding the huge resources needed to
invest in new developments, particularly
those of technology, in training manage-
ment and in other intangibles. (Thus
U.S. international companies have
benefited most from the European
Common Market because since its in-
ception they have set up operations to
compete in the whole market rather
than in single countries.)
Another problem for those who would
curb the Americans is the disunity of
the Common Market countries. The
fact is, as de Gaulle learned several
years ago, that if France says, “No, we
will not allow a U.S. auto firm to put
a plant in France,” the company can
outflank him by building it in a neigh-
boring country (in this case, Belgium)
and exporting to France.
A more fundamental problem is that
if the Common Market countries
adopted a united front to constrain
further U.S. investment, but took no
other steps, they would fall further and
further behind technologically. But
machine-breaking sabotage will work
no better now than it ever has in the
past, and one way or another Europe
will “acquire” the new technology. If
U.S. firms cannot bring it in outright
through investment, they will “smuggle”"
it by embodying it in U.S. exports.
Thus the new technology incorporated
in cheaper and superior U.S. goods
would not only capture markets in
Europe but also in the rest of the
world and thereby render impotent a
European economy heavily dependent
on trade. Rather than suffer this catas-
trophe most Europeans would probably
choose direct U.S. investment. The end
of that road might be a psychically
painful Canada-type satellite economy-
with the bulk of industry owned by
the United States, but the standard of
living would be relatively high.
The solution which most Europeans
would obviously prefer is for Europe
“somehow” to create its own resources
for overcoming the “technology gap.”
The major snag is the investment, huge
relative to Europe’s xesources, required
not only for building new factories but
for research, education, etc. For ex-
ample, the French Government had to
allocate $BO million, as an initial sum
merely for research, to launch an all-
French computer company which it is
hoped will be a viable competitor to
the U.S. giants.
If money is the main obstacle, the
key to obtaining resources for Euro-
pean self-development may lie in
Europe’s vast gold hoards. In a sense,
what is needed is a reversal of the
basic exchange which has underlain
U.S.-European economic relations for
two decades. During this period the
U.S. has built up enormous real
economic power in Europe by invest-
ment in factories and business organi-
sations. In exchange, Europeans have
accrued enormous financial power, in

the form of hoards of gold and dollars.
Up to this point it has been a poor
trade for the Europeans because the
gold and dollar hoards are essentially
sterile; the gold earns nothing and
the dollars, even when held in U.S.
Treasury notes, earn only a few per-
cent a year. U.S. foreign investment, on
the other hand, is far more profitable
and can grow rapidly simply by profit
ploughback. Moreover, while the pur-
chasing power of the dollar declines in
the current inflationary period, the
value of the U.S. investment rises.
The Europeans cannot catch up now
simply by disgorging their gold and
dollar hoards, because this would en-
courage the United States to accelerate
its investment. After all, it is only the
Europeans’ increased appetite for gold
that has forced the United States to
make any attempt to slow down its
overseas investment program. But
Europe now has an opportunity to
attempt to recoup some of its losses
through a world-wide devaluation of the
dollar along with all other currencies,
i.e., by a big jump in the price of gold.
A world-wide devaluation of all
currencies by the same percentage
would not change their relationship:
one U.S. dollar would still exchange
for four German marks or five French
francs. Flence no country would gain
a trade advantage over any other. The
primary beneficiaries would be the
major gold-producing countries—South
Africa and the Soviet Union plus
countries with large hoards of gold,
that is, most of continental Europe.
The Common Market countries alone
hold $l5 billion in gold officially, and
private accumulations tucked away in
mattresses and Swiss safe-deposit boxes
may be of the order of $lO billion.
Thus, if the price of gold were
doubled, the Common Market countries
would enjoy a “windfall profit” of
the order of $25 billion, or more than
the book value of U.S. investment in
all of Europe.
Such an enormous windfall could go
a long way toward making Europe a
great independent industrial power.
Some of it might be used to buy out
at premium prices the European plants
of U.S. firms, or even in certain key
industries to purchase the complete
operations of smaller U.S. firms with
good technological prospects. More im-
portant, most of this money could be
spent to improve education, support
basic and applied research, and pro-
mote European firms in the crucial
growth sectors. Such efforts would be
greatly assisted by the fact that the
bulk of the windfall would accrue
directly to the European central
governments. While the governments
could either set up state (or even inter-
state) companies pr liberally subsidise
private firms in the crucial industries,
the fundamental point is that the money
would be initially concentrated where
there would be a will to use it.
The United States Government is
completely opposed to such a world-
wide devaluation. Still, it is conceiv-
able that the European governments
could force the issue, either by threaten-
ing to “bankrupt” the United States
by demanding gold in exchange for
their dollars, or by conceitedly devalu-
ing their own currencies and thus
threatening the U.S. trade position.
Therefore one may well ask why, if
a jump in the price of gold would be
so enormously profitable for the Euro-
peans, they have not taken either of
these steps toward a devaluation in
their currencies.
One deterrent must be the fear that
any massive change in the value of
currencies could so shatter confidence
in international finance and money
markets as to wreck international trade
and bring on a world depression.
Second, the windfall benefit would be
unevenly distributed among the Euro-
pean powers. France would benefit by
far the most, and West Germany, the
strongest European power, might fear
such a boost to its neighbor’s position.
Finally and probably the most im-
portant reason for European caution
is that even if Europe were united on
That troublesome commodity, gold,
stored in the vault of the Federal Re-
serve Bank of New York
this strategy it would probably pro-
voke an open and violent struggle with
the United States, which has a tremen-
dous stake in not letting Europe simply
buy out investment that has been built
up over 20 years, or in allowing Europe
to develop the kind of rival economic
base which would threaten the profits
of U.S. firms.
One weapon the Americans might
use, and which they have hinted at,
is the countering of a European run on
their gold supply by refusing to have
anything further to do with gold.
According to these quarters, the value
of Europe’s gold hoards might then
shrink drastically since only the willing-
ness of the U.S. Government to buy and
sell gold at $35 an ounce keeps the price
that high. Lacking that support, it is
said, gold’s price would sink toward its
use value as an industrial metal, esti-
mated by some at less than $lO an
ounce. While Europeans may doubt the
ability of the United States to abandon
gold, as well as the consequent drop
in price if it did, the situation is suffi-
ciently uncertain to signal caution. For
one thing, U.S. abandonment of a fixed
gold price would mean freely fluctua-
ting exchange rates, which in turn
might prove a serious barrier to inter-
national trade.
All parties agree that something must
be done soon about the precarious situ-
ation. The United States sees a long-
run solution in the ultimate elimination
of gold’s role (and implicitly the
triumph of the dollar’s role) in the
woi'ld monetary system. In fact, U.S.
monetary experts sometimes talk about
the gold problem as if it were caused
by a psychological hang-up on the part
of those who so tenaciously cling to the
yellow metal; the Chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board even refers to it
as a “barbarous relic.” The U.S.
favors creation of IMF special drawing
rights (SDRs), sometimes called
“paper gold.” As for the technology
gap, the U.S. position seems to
be that Europe is foolish to worry,
since U.S. control of European industry
will bring with it a rising standard of
living. But if Europeans insist on in-
digenous control of industry, then a
“United States of Europe” should be
formed, with Great Britain as a key
component.
The European response varies within
and among countries, depending largely
on particular self-interests, with the
French being the most hostile. But
there is certainly a general agreement
among the Europeans, who for two
decades have provided the United
States with billions of dollars’ worth of
factories in exchange for millions of
ounces of gold, that now is no time
to “forget about” this barbarous relic
just because it has little “intrinsic”
value. (By analogy, the rest of the world
might tell the United States to forget
about its overseas factories and mines,
since its claim to them rests in owner-
ship certificates which are just worth-
less pieces of paper that cannot even
be used to fill teeth; such is the subver-
sive logic of those who would consign
gold to the monetary scrapheap.)
Europeans must find this U.S. attempt
to downgrade gold particularly irri-
tating, because 25 years ago at the
Bretton Woods Conference the United
States rejected Keynes’ proposal for an
analogue of the current “paper gold”
plan precisely because it insisted on the
supremacy of metallic gold. At that
time, of course, the United States held
two-thirds of the world’s supply.
As to the immediate financial crises,
Europeans also generally agree that the
U.S. balance of payments deficit must
be reduced as a first step. It now seems
clear that, at the historic Basle meeting
of last March, where the two-tier gold-
price system was established and agree-
ment was tentatively reached on the
outlines of the SDRs, this agreement
was coupled with an understanding
that, at a minimum, the United States
would not escalate its commitment in
Vietnam. But how much additional
pressure the European governments
would be willing to exert today is not
at all clear. The whole Basle package
of hastily constructed financial agree-
ments seems so unworkable in the long
run as to suggest that it is a stall-


ing tactic on the part of everyone to
cool down the situation, while further
struggles and bargaining go on behind
the scenes. After all, something was
necessary at that time, since the inter-
national money markets were running
wild and panic was rapidly setting in.
Regarding the proposed U.S. solu-
tion for overcoming its real economic
lead, France at least seems unalterably
opposed to letting Great Britain into
“Europe,” viewing it as a Trojan horse
for the Americans. Since France takes
this position there is little need for
the other European countries to show
their hands. (As with many problems
involving delicate relations with the
United States, de Gaulle serves as a
convenient “lightning rod” for other
European governments.) In any event,
none of the Common Market countries
wants Great Britain to come in without
resolution of its sterling problem, which
leads back again to the financial crises.
In an ultimate sense the crucial
question would seem to be whether
European capital is really prepared to
slug it out with U.S. capital for
supremacy in Europe, and ultimately
for a significant position in the under-
developed world, or whether it is pre-
pared to accept the subordinate role of
running the relatively stagnant and less
profitable traditional industries such as
textiles and steel. Given the rate at
which technology is developing, a deci-
sion must be made soon before the
U.S. lead becomes virtually insurmount-
able. Undoubtedly there are strong
groups within Europe that would be
content with a subordinate position. For
example, the Belgian steel producer
who can have his profits improved by
computerisation may be eager for IBM
to come in with the best equipment
available. Again, European executives
of U.S. firms, or the indigenous sup-
pliers of these firms, may be eager for
further U.S. expansion.
Nevertheless, the Common Market
countries have not reached the point
(as Great Britain probably has) where
their capitalist class as a whole is so
weak as to be unwilling to fight for these
new markets. Many competent Euro-
pean companies are holding their own
in the face of fierce U.S. competition.
Moreover, there is beginning a wave of
European mergers which can help
strengthen their financial ability to move
into the new industries. Thus if the
European governments felt they had a
reasonable chance to pull off the kind
of financial coup discussed earlier, they
would probably ultimately attempt it.
However, in the past year the finan-
cial crisis has so accelerated that the
final resolution may no longer lie in the
relatively cool and carefully calculating
hands of European and U.S. govern-
ments, but rather in the hot and reck-
lessly greedy hands of the world’s
monetary speculators. International
finance has become the world’s most
widespread crap game, with potential
quick profits which makes the rewards
from speculation on the American
Stock Exchange look feeble by com-
parison. Bets are placed either by sell-
ing short on a specific weak currency
which might have to be devalued (and
can thereby be bought back later at a
lower price) or by buying gold in the
hope of a universal currency devalua-
tion.
The first case which whetted the
appetites of the world’s “hot money”
gamblers was last year’s successful raid
on the British pound, which ended in
devaluation. This was not only enor-
mously profitable to the speculators but
also showed such speculation to be a
favorite sport for a much larger num-
ber of people than ever before. A “Wall
Street Journal” report (November 22,
1967) neatly captures the flavor of the
game:
“Some of the boys in Youngstown,
Ohio, found the stock market too
erratic for their taste last week, so they
looked for something safer -- like a
raid on the British pound sterling.
“The group eight to ten doctors,
lawyers, and other professional men
with a sophisticated bent for specula-
tion made their decision Friday to
plunge into the murky waters of inter-
national finance. By 2 p.m. (E.S.T.),
when the time difference cut short their
trading, they had borrowed and sold
short £70,000.
“ ‘We thought we’d have time to sell
Flashback to March when President
Johnson’s refusal to devalue the dollar
led to frantic selling on the Paris market
more pounds short Monday,’ says one
of the group, but Britain’s abrupt de-
valuation Saturday night ended the
foray. Selling short £70,000 is small
compared to operations of bigger specu-
lators and bear raiders in continental
Europe. But it was enough, with the
devaluation, to assure the Ohioans col-
lectively a profit of more than $23,000
on the $20,000 cash they put up to go
short on sterling valued Friday at
nearly $196,000.”
The second round of speculation
centred on private purchases of gold
in the open market, which this year
drove the price of gold up to $45 an
ounce. Further, it forced the U.S. and
European governments to close down
their international gold pool which had
previously successfully stabilised gold at
$35 an ounce. While gold’s price
declined to the $4O level, speculators
who had bought at the official support
price of $35 and sold at $4O realised a
few hundred percent profit on their in-
vestment in a short time (most of the
money to buy gold is borrowed from
banks, thereby “leveraging” the specu-
lator’s own money). Since spring, the
free market price of gold has been fluctu-
ating around $4O, indicating that specu-
lators still hope for a world-wide
devaluation. (So, too, does the govern-
ment of South Africa, which has been
refusing to sell enough gold on the
open market to drive the price back to
$35.)
The very activities of monetary
speculators can help to make the
rumors of world-wide devaluation a self-
fulfilling prophecy. For one thing, the
difference between the free market price
and the official price of gold is a
naked index of world confidence in
paper moneys. As the gap which is
itself stimulated by speculative buying
gets wider, governments may begin
to panic and turn in their dollars to
Washington for gold, thereby bringing
on a monetary breakdown. Then, as
the gap grows smaller, central banks,
which can legally cash their dollars for
gold through the U.S. Treasury at $35,
may be tempted to resell this gold
secretly on the private market, at, per-
haps, $5O per ounce, and then seek more
gold from the United States at $35. As
an economist connected with a Euro-
pean government put it, “There are a
lot of crooks around, and some of them
are central bankers” (“Wall Street
Journal,” March 18).
Finally, in a period of increasing
monetary uncertainty, speculators jump
on any currency that looks weak and
sell it short. Since this is a game where
he who stumbles gets kicked again to
keep him down, such speculative pres-
sures can themselves be the deathblow.
Any devaluation now of a major cur-
rency could force a self-protective
chain reaction ending in universal
devaluation. This is important because,
even after its recent devaluation, ster-
ling is under renewed speculative fire,
as is the franc because of the social
upheaval in France.
It is interesting that, while the latter
event has weakened de Gaulle’s position
somewhat, the net effect may yet be
to hasten a world devaluation. For one
thing, the gold which France has lost
since its “revolution” has largely filled
the coffers of the other European gov-
ernments, thereby giving them a greater
direct stake in an increased gold price.
Moreover, if France is forced to de-
value (or chooses to act as if it were)
this might bring on the world-wide
devaluation.
Given the underlying conflicts of U.S.
and European interests in the inter-
national economy, the upshot of all this
wild speculation could turn out to be a
chaotic rout for all. Financial markets
could collapse, international trade and
investment dry up, and internal
economies be badly depressed. The
growing brinkmanship between the
United States and Europe is thus an
extremely dangerous game. However, it
would not be the first time that nations
in pursuit of their “vital interests” have
miscalculated and fallen into the
crevasse. Financiers all over the world
are studying the clues as to whether w r e
are moving closer to the edge.

Buckets made from Hostalen high density polyethylene will not burst, crack or distort,
even if you fill them with boiling water. These same unique qualities can be found in
all plastics products made from Hostalen - everything from kitchenware to toys. If you
want to be sure that you get quality plastics - and more and more Australians do -
look for the products with the Hostalen label. They will be rigid, hygienic, easy to clean
and virtually unbreakable, which means they will not crack up - unless you have an
elephant around to stand on them. The manufacturer who makes his products from
Hostalen wants to give you the very best - and so does the shop that sells them. So
it’s worth looking for the products with the label that says “made from Hostalen".

Why
Australians
don’t become
stars
Nancye Hayes, judged, a star but where now?
By DENIS O'BRIEN
STAR is a four-letter word that fits
expediently into an afternoon news-
paper poster. Nancye Hayes has come
to learn the shallowness of its meaning.
Seven months in the musical “Sweet
Charity,” and success was something
heady; a euphoric feeling of accom-
plishment took control of tomorrow.
Join the queue for Nancye Hayes. After
the ball that was “Sweet Charity” was
over, Nancye Hayes was out of work
for seven months.
At first it was just a comfortable
state of happy indolence. Work was
another four-letter word and the
absence of it was easily rationalised
under the influence of a restful holiday
under the sun in Queensland. Even
after two or three months there was still
the reassurance of Press notices that
had anchored the transience of her
achievement into black-and-white per-
manence. The ineradicable verdict
across the nation had been that Nancye
Hayes had confirmed her promise and
become a star of the Australian theatre.
One or two knowing heads had even
given her Charity half a nod more
than that for Broadway’s Gwen Verdon.
So look out, world.
It wasn’t just the treacherous
capriciousness of show business that
turned the milk sour; it was more
because of the inability of Australian
show business to support a star system,
even it it wanted to.
For seven months Nancye Hayes had
been projected as a star and had per-
formed with star quality. She was paid
$3OO a week which is roughly half
what an overseas anonymity would
have been paid for the part, but which
passes for magnanimity in payment to
Australian “stars” and she had will-
ingly been taken past the point of no
return to the chorus. The yawning
emptiness that opened to her
after the closing of “Sweet
Charity” was . . . shrug . . .
just one of those Australian
things. Whatever happened to
Jill Perryman?
Nancye Hayes talking: “It’s
not much more than eight years
since I was a ‘grasshopper’ a
Stella Maris Convent schoolgirl
in a green dress and a straw
hat, going home to Mum at
Manly and daydreaming about
most of the things that have become
realities. So I’m not complaining. I
don’t think anyone owes me a living.
But it’s difficult trying to turn my
acomplishments to good advantage. Of
course, it’s very satisfying to have been
given the star treatment, but even
though I’ve never allowed it to over-
whelm me I can’t help feeling a bit
disappointed. I’m talking about profes-
sional progress, not the trappings of the
star bit. I’ve always felt uneasy about
using the word star.”
In a language tortured and abused
to describe the synthetic and the
abstract, the word star has become one
of the most meaningless in the lexicon.
In the same week that Miss Hayes came
blazing into view as Charity Hope
Valentine, a model, a TV newsreader,
and Dita Cobb all were, for one reason
or another, described as stars.
The word had its colloquial origins
in early Hollywood, which wasn’t the
most promising nursery for the defini-
tion of anything in English. Born a
bastard, it has suffered so many illegiti-
mate couplings that it has now become
a dubious noun even in rightful parent-
age.
Recently, the word underwent a re-
fining qualification to distinguish the
gloss from the dross: Richard Burton
and Elizabeth Taylor became super-
stars, and so, in one confusing metamor-
phosis from medical anonymity to
celebrity status, did Dr. Christiaan
Barnard. Soon, one imagines, we will
have star bus conductors, superstar
accountants, and, for essential different-
iation, megastar film stars. In such a
ga.me of semantical invention it is of
passing interest to note the almost
complete disappearance of that strange
hothouse flower the starlet. Perhaps the
crowded galaxy is forcing them all to
shine before they can twinkle.
The Pocket Oxford Dictionary
defines star as “a brilliant or prominent
person,” but we all know what we
mean by the word even though, in an
age of empty values, we might not
mean what we say. Don Lane is a star,
Don Dunstan is not; Nancy Bird-
Walton is a distinguished airwoman but
not a star; Nancye Hayes is a talented
actress and, by the judgment of Aus-
tralian theatre critics, is a star. The
word is the rightful property of show
business, a password for the personality
cult, a trading stamp that helps sell
seats —and advertising.
Yet, Australia’s conscious egalitarian-
ism, its second-rate entertainment in-
dustry with no clear top and a very
broad bottom, its lack of one central
capital where standards can be tested
and verified as they can in London or
New York, all contribute to the flat-
tening of a star system. There is no
.milieu in Australia in which stars can
flourish nor sympathetic hothouse
where they are cultivated.
The most recent example of Aus-
tralia’s strange anti-star attitude con-
cerned Tony Ward, the male lead of
the television secret agent series
“Hunter.” Although Ward has a small
talent stretched around a large ego,
he had been invested with some of the
symbols of stardom and had begun to
carry them with conviction. But the
first time he began behaving in the
manner that the public expects stars
to behave in his case by suddenly
flying off to America on a mysterious
mission without telling his employers
he was publicly reprimanded by the
Crawford organisation, which makes
“Hunter,” in a way that a clerk would
be caned for sneaking off to the pictures
in the afternoon. Any loss to the Craw-
fords seemed to be more than offset by
the publicity they gained for their
series, not to mention Ward’s enhance-
ment of his fictional role. It would have
been so simple for the affair to be
carried off with a harmless gloss. In-
stead, it became rancorous, star status
was demeaned, and Ward is now about
to be replaced by a relatively un-
known actor. Another star?
By careful definition, Graham
Kennedy is Australia’s only genuine


In “How To Succeed” ...second from the right in one of the best song-and-dance lines Betty Pounder ever drilled
star, performing publicly and living
privately with that recognisable style
and class that puts the essential dis-
tance between stars and their public.
Kennedy’s significant advantage,
though, is that he has been in con-
tinuous employment for more than ten
years in the one role, and hasn’t had
to diversify to consolidate his status —
a vital factor in the career of any
entertainer once distinctively singled
out. Diversification shouldn’t be neces-
sary to star status Gordon Chater,
for example, shouldn’t have to perform
as an imitation Dean Martin in a TV
variety show when he’s a superb revue
artist but the limited opportunities in
Australia almost make it vital for those
once nominated as stars to hop into
the nearest two-way radio talk show
or the first Leagues Club booking the
moment there are job gaps in their
own genre. Exclusivity, one of the
privileges of the star, is difficult to
practise without cost in Australia.
There is no longer a lack of work for
actors in Australia so long as they are
always prepared to work without a
chance of great distinction. Their earn-
ing capacity has improved (the estab-
lished actors with an anchor job and
one or two of the many sidelines avail-
able can earn between $lOO and $2OO
a week), but ambition, true status, and
distinctiveness still have to be sought
abroad.
The theatre in Australia doesn’t have
that confident braggadocio that accom-
modates the truly compelling talent and
personality, and certainly doesn’t breed
the attractions of a theatrical elite. Aus-
tralian television drama or situation
comedy relentlessly renders most actors
into the same undistinguished mould;
the reviving film industry is still far
from the day when Australians will be
cast as anything more than supports
for the package-deal stars flown in
from overseas. (No Australian still liv-
ing here can yet substantiate the star
billing necessary to promise a reason-
able international return on invest-
ment.)
For Nancye Hayes for anyone
whose career largely depends on the
Australian musical theatre the
promise is demoralising: the one major
producer still in business, J. C.
Williamson, stages an average of only
two musicals a year. The country
hasn’t a large enough population to
support .more. Two a year . . . one for
Jill, one for Nancye if they are ex-
cessively lucky. But even though that
seems like an ideal situation it is
paradoxically unsuitable as a profes-
sional proposition. Without more than
the 750,000-1,000,000 patrons within
desirous reach of the musical box-
office, that sort of constant familiarity
would breed over-familiarity, which is
not the stuff of star status.
Professionally, Nancye Hayes is a
product of the J. C. Williamson organ-
isation, the firm’s classiest four-cylinder
actress to take off for at least 20 years,
one of the youngest Australians to
whom it has given star billing. She
was only 24 when she commanded the
stage in “Sweet Charity” at the begin-
ning of last year.
Nancye Hayes talking: “I can still
remember the afternoon after auditions
in the Theatre Royal when Mr.
Strachan, of J. C. Williamson, called
me aside and asked if I’d like to play
Charity. I remember racing to the
phone at the back of the stage to tell
my mother, ‘l’ve got the part, I’ve got
the part.’ It really was a wonderful
moment in my life. And then, later,
some people began saying. ‘She’ll never
keep it up,’ because it’s a terribly ex-
hausting part; Charity is hardly ever
off the stage. But I did keep it up,
for the whole seven months of the run.
At the end I felt as if I could have
gone on for another 28 weeks, but by
that time we were running out of
audiences.”
And then J. C. Williamson’s ran out
of musicals for Nancye Hayes, just as
it had for Jill Perryman after she had
dazzled Australia in “Funny Girl.”
Jill Perryman had genuinely deserved
star billing years before she was given
it for “Funny Girl” in 1966. William-
son’s, and most other managements of
the time, had preferred to believe that
Australians wouldn’t pay to see Aus-
tralians in American musicals, so they
shiftily compromised by importing un-
known Americans. To no one’s great
surprise, Miss Perryman confounded
them and then virtually disappeared
from public view. The promotion which
Williamson’s had unprecedentedly
mounted to launch her in “Funny Girl”
counted for little after the show closed.
The Australian entertainment industry
can absorb reputations but has difficulty
sustaining star talent. Jill did a season
in a small Melbourne theatre-restaurant
and has since made a few guest
appearances on television. It will have
been almost three years since the open-
ing of “Funny Girl” when she gets
back on stage for Williamson’s in the
Broadway musical “I Do, I Do” next
year.
Conceivably, Nancye Hayes could be
out of mainstream theatrical circula-
tion for just as long. Her major oppor-
tunities, like Jill’s, are linked to the
J. C. Williamson heavy reliance on
Broadway pickings. When Broadway
roars its approval the Williamson cheque
book is ready, not before.
The new season on Broadway is just
beginning. Nancye has studied the list-
ings (see box on page 54) without
much optimism. “At this distance it is
difficult to see much there that shrieks
for me. Anyway, it is usually at least
a year after a musical opens in New
York before we get a chance to see it in
Australia. The one show I’d really like
to have a crack at is ‘Cabaret.’ It has
been held over for another season on
Broadway, and it is a big success in
London, but as far as I know William-
sons have not made any plans to stage
it here.”
They haven’t. “Cabaret” is “under
consideration,” but its theme of
decadence in pre-Hitler Berlin, even
though subtly expressed as an act of
defiance against emptiness, is not
altogether compatible with the sensi-
tive J. C. Williamson box-office.
Says Williamson’s managing director,
Harry Strachan: “We certainly haven’t
forgotten Nancye Hayes. We think very
highly of her; she is a tremendous per-
former. It is simply a matter of find-
ing the right vehicle for her and none
of the musicals we’ve produced since
‘Sweet Charity’ have been suitable.”
In only five shows for the Williamson
management Nancye had progressed
from the small print of the chorus to
the spotlight of star billing, and then
found her career hanging like a comma.
She is a deceptively soft-centred

How to get a Hertz rental car
anywhere in Australia
without leaving home
If you can get to a telephone,
you can get a Hertz car. One
call to your local Hertz office
is all that’s needed. If you’re
flying interstate and you need
a car, phone Hertz before
you leave. Hertz pre-booking
means the right car, at the
right place, at the right time
be it airport, station or
dock. Hertz guarantee it.
And the Ford or other fine car
you get from Hertz has been
run-in, but never run down. It’s
a Hertz policy to trade in cars
early in life. It’s also Hertz
policy to give every car a
thorough check-up before it
checks out. It’s called the
‘Hertz 19 point check-up’. We
check the big things like hand
brake, foot brake, clutch,
steering. And the little things
like the seat adjustment lever,
the heater, the radio. If they
don’t work, you don’t get the
car. So the car you do get,
works. And it’s also clean.
That’s another Hertz policy.
We wash and wax the outside,
vacuum and dust the inside.
And we never forget to clean
the windscreen.
And here’s another nice sur-
prise. Hertz rents cars at a
lower rate than any other
major car rental company in
Australia. And only Hertz has
Economile the special ‘long
distance’ rate that saves you
money. Your daily mileage
rate can be reduced up to
50%.
Give Hertz a call next time
you need a car. The number
is in your local directory. And
there’s a car ready for you
anywhere you name.
Hertz: The key to more than a car.

“How To Succeed.” ABOVE:
As Luce (with Ted Hamil-
ton) in “Boys From Syra-
cuse”...every night a
combustible delight
young woman: not quite hard enough
to fight the battles of her profession
alone but astute enough to make up
her own mind that it is not the right
moment to see how the story ends in
London. She has had the money for
the ticket since “Charity” closed and
twice has been as close as next week
to flying off. Each time she has
measured the value of her opportunities
here against her immediate prospects
abroad and delayed her flight to
accumulate experience that puts beef
into her references.
Nancye Hayes talking: “I’m in love
with a man and when it’s possible I
hope to marry him, but I have no
obligations in Australia. My father was
killed in a car accident when I was
ten, my mother died after an oper-
ation last year. I’m 25 and right now
would seem to be the time to see if
all that I’ve achieved in Australia
means anything overseas. But I’ll wait
for a while. I’m ambitious, but I don’t
think I’m impulsive.”
Her early childhood was painfully
eventful. When seven years old she fell
off a birthday bike, aggravating an
injury caused by an earlier fall from
a tree. After being treated for strained
leg muscles she was found to have a
cyst on her left hip. She remembers
the face of an orthopaedic surgeon
leaning over her hospital bed and
gently asking, “And what are you going
to be when you grow up?” A dancer—
a ballerina was all she had ever
wanted to be. “I see. Well, we’ll have
to do a good job on you, won’t we.”
They did. She spent six months in a
Newcastle hospital and a further year
with both her legs in callipers. When
they came off, her doctor advised in-
tensive dancing lessons to strengthen
her leg muscles. For the child it was
sweet therapy.
She gave her first professional
audition when she was 17 for a
part in the energetically youthful
musical “Bye Bye Birdie.” Turned
down because she looked too old, she
took mother’s advice about the “riski-
ness” of show business and studied
shorthand and typing. She just had
time to practise it for the New South
Wales Forestry Commission before
being reme,mbered by the Williamson
people for a place in the dancing en-
semble for their record-busting pro-
duction of “My Fair Lady.” She toured
with the show for two years £2O
a week and every day felt like Satur-
day night. There was no time for Sun-
day morning; almost immediately after
“Fair Lady” at last closed, Nancye
began rehearsing in the song-and-dance
line for “How To Succeed in Business
Without Really Trying.” The show
was a catalyst to her career.
At first she was second from the end
on the right-hand side of one of the
best lines that choreographer Betty
Pounder has ever drilled for J. C.
Williamson; before the show left
Sydney to tour, Nancye had replaced
American Betty Maguire in the low-
necked, brassy-bosomed, supporting
lead role of Hedy La Rue, dumb blonde.
Blue eyes blazing, square jaw jutting,
body and soul pouring into a happy
fiction . . . Nancye nightly became a
combustible delight. Heaven knows
how long she could have contained

recalled to the U.S. She was clearly

promise confirmed
LEFT: As Annie Oakley in
“Annie Get Your Gun.”
ABOVE: As Belle Poitrine in
“Little Me” ...a major attrac-
tion in a series of mini-musicals
a remarkably promising actress. The
Williamson people knew it but couldn’t
capitalise on her promise at a time
when they needed an answer to the
growing criticism of their import
policy. Their inflexible schedule con-
tained nothing for Nancye, but when
“Hello, Dolly!” was cast (with three
American leads) they did find her a
part. You might have missed her
she was swaddled in rags for the elderly
crone she played.
As it turned out, “Dolly” helped to
give Jill Perryman’s career a push. She
frequently stood in as Dolly for the
ailing American Carole Cook, and for
a brief while Nancye took Jill’s role.
She had to surrender it because of her
inability to cope with the soprano
trilling it called for. She can belt a
song like a miniature Merman, but
still hasn’t a confident voice for orna-
mental frills.
After “Dolly,” Nancye moved into
an interestingly inventive JCW revival
of “The Boys From Syracuse,” in which
she stood out like a professional fire-
cracker among a few damp squibs


whose television reputations had earned
them better billing.
At this time the Hotel Menzies in
Sydney had begun producing com-
pressed versions of Broadway musicals
in its Emperor Room theatre-
restaurant, with Hayes Gordon direct-
ing a series of strikingly excellent
revivals. Nancye played there in “Kiss
Me Kate” and “Brigadoon” before get-
ting the call for “Sweet Charity.” She
went back there to star successively in
“Bells Are Ringing,” “Little Me,” and
“Annie Get Your Gun,” after stardom
as Charity put the long comma on her
career. The Emperor Room is a tricky
arena. On nights when it is crowded
with boozy conventioneers and visiting
firemen, it can be an almost intolerably
difficult room to play to; on nights
when the mixture of audience and
musical is right, its open stage and
comparative intimacy bring enthusiams
to a rare boil.
In the past few months, Nancye
Hayes has been using the room like a
coliseum, putting down some memor-
ably vivid performances, each time
attracting confirmation of her star
quality. Sydney’s theatre critics have
been in constantly unanimous opinion
about it.
Nancye Hayes talking: “I share a flat
in the Cross with Judith Roberts and
Reg Gorman, who are married, and
very dear friends of mine. I don’t live
in the grand manner ... I like the
simple life.
“Since Charity, I know that people
have begun to recognise me. Sometimes
it’s fun to see people in the street
recognise my face but not immediately
be able to put my name to it. I still
get mail flowing on to me from that
show, and now and then I still meet
strangers who thought I was American.
But I’m a bit soft about some of the
effects of the star business. For instance,
I’m always touched when elderly
people come round to the dressing-room
to say how much they enjoyed the
show, and the other week I couldn’t
stop myself going to a girl’s 21st birth-
day party to a roomful of complete
strangers in an outer suburb because
the girl’s admiration for Charity had
been something like mine for the
theatre when I was younger.”
Currently, Nancye Hayes’ largest
opportunity in Australia rests with
television. She resisted an offer to star
in the present show at Menzies,
“Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,” because
she thought three successive shows there
was maximum exposure from the one
stage for the time being. She was about
to buy her ticket to London when
Channel 7 offered her a contract for
the “Mavis Bramston Show.” She
accepted, mainly because Jon Ewing,
who directed her in the last three shows
at Menzies, had taken over as the
“Bramston” producer.
In the little television work she has
done so far she hasn’t been seen to the
best advantage, a circumstance which I
suspect is more due to the theatrical
inexperience of television personnel
than her own inexperience in television.
The medium has been inclined to
flatten her personality and suppress the
stirring sexuality she’s capable of trans-
mitting from the stage. Her one major
involvement in television to date was a
“special” she made for HSV7 in Mel-
bourne after “Sweet Charity” and in
which the late Tony Hancock was a
guest star. It has never been released
in Sydney and Nancye thinks it prob-
ably would have to escape to get a
wider showing.
The sudden abandonment of the
familiar “Bramston” show she thought
she was going to for the still uncer-
tain variety half-hour it is to become
is an awkward challenge. Her reputation
as a star of the theatre will be evalu-
ated by thousands in a mass audience
who have never seen her in the theatre.
Australian television isn’t noted for its
careful treatment of talent it hasn’t
bred itself and Nancye could benefit in
the encounter if she had star manage-
ment to look after her interests.
Without an effective star system, though,
there are gaps in the cycle.
Nancye Hayes talking: “During that
long gap after ‘Charity’ I went along
to try for a part in the ‘Riptide’ TV
series. I wasn’t big-noting myself, but
I had amounted to something, so I was
a bit put off by the shabby way I got
treated. When I eventually got in to
see the man who was doing the inter-
views he just sort of grunted through
everything I’d done, and then said: ‘Yes,
but can you act?’ From where he sat
it was probably a reasonable question,
but for the life of me I didn’t know
how to start to tell him.”
And that, as they say, is showbiz.
In Australia it’s a great leveller.
WAITING FOR BROADWAY
THE annual phenomenon of the New
York theatre season is at hand. Each
September-October Broadway begins
unpacking its razzle-dazzle ambitions
for another year. Musicals, comedies,
dramas, extravaganzas, and a few
beguilingly modest mixtures are opened
with optimism and often closed
before the paint is dry. Those that sur-
vive usually have far-reaching influence;
a large part of the world’s theatre
indeed, the world’s entertainment indus-
try is shaped by a Broadway season.
Nowhere are the Broadway seasons
studied with more calculating interest
than in Australia, where the theatre
managements and entrepreneurs are
hungry for pre-packaged successes, and
performers eye their job prospects for
seasons ahead.
For Nancye Hayes, the interest is the
new Broadway musicals the gaudy
big wheel of the theatre and her
theatrical raison d’etre. At lease nine
new musicals will bow in this season.
With the held-over successes from last
season, musicals will again dominate
legitimate drama by a score 17-12.
The prospects:
“And Now Noel Coward,” a revue
built around Coward’s songs and
sketches and starring George Grizzard
and Dorothy Loudon. Its Vancouver
try-out was apparently so morbidly re-
garded that a play doctor was flown
from New York to attempt a heart
transplant on the old master’s somewhat
dated material.
“Her First Roman,” Leslie Uggams’
new vehicle, is based on Shaw’s “Caesar
and Cleopatra” and co-stars Richard
Kiley. So far it has not been successful
on the try-out trail.
“Maggie Flynn” stars Shirley Jones
and Jack Cassidy and is a bittersweet
love story set in New York City during
the Civil War era. Advance scouts say
it has little chance of survival.
“A Mother’s Kisses.” Based on the
celebrated novel of Bruce Jay Fried-
man, this could be another “Fiddler
On The Roof” success, full of gemuet-
lich Jewish humor and dance-in-the-
aisles-style music.
“Promises, Promises.” Based on the
book and movie “The Apartment,” this
is an almost surefire hit with its music
by Bert Bacharach and its stars Jerry
Orbach and Jill O’Hara.
“The Fig Leaves Are Falling.” This
satire on suburbia deals with the dalli-
ance of a 42-year-old married man with
a teenaged girl. Written by comedian
Allan Sherman, it stars Barry Nelson.
“Zorba” is based on the famous
Kazantzakis novel and film; it will
star Herschel Bernardi in the title role,
assisted by Maria Karnilova. Producer-
director Harold Prince says it won’t be
much like the book or the film.
“Dear World.” Angela Lansbury is
Broadway’s gift to the world, - come
Boxing Day, in this updated version of
Giraudoux’s “Madwoman of Chaillot.”
Her co-star is Milo O’Shea of “Ulysses”
film fame.
“The Exception And The Rule.” A
new vehicle for Zero Mostel, adapted
from Brecht by Leonard Bernstein and
Jerome Sondheim.
The musicals held over from previous
seasons are: “Cabaret,” “Fiddler On
The Roof,” “George M,” “Golden
Rainbow,” “Hair,” “Hello, Dolly!”
“Marne,” “Man of La Mancha,” and
“The Happy Time.”
Unlike “Hair,” the tribal love-rock
musical which has transferred from its
original off-Broadway premises and is
destined to run strongly through the
next year, the new shows would not
seem to offer much opportunity for the
hippie scene or the stage nudity feat-
ured in that trailblazer, although some
are still in the formative stage and
could yet grow some derivative “hair.”
It is worthy of note that of the
dozen or so new musicals scheduled for
opening this season only two (“Maggie
Flynn” and “Fig Leaves”) are original;
most of the others are “based-ons.”

BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
A miraculous plucking of
figures from wigs
WELL, $1.35 IS a nice precise figure
for a wage increase and it suggests
after years of $l, $2, and other round
figures that at last the Arbitration
Commission has got around to some
systematic analysis of what the economy
can bear in the way of a wage in-
crease. Maybe the first reaction is
the Commission has at last accepted
the logic of productivity gearing
the internationally accepted means of
running an incomes policy.
But the reader of the judgment is
soon disillusioned on this score: “We
all agree that in the present circum-
stances of full employment and in the
absence of an incomes policy it is just
not practicable for increases in wages
and salaries to be kept confined within
productivity increases.” Then comes
the astonishing statement that members
of the Commission had “discussed be-
tween ourselves subjects such as the
role of the Commission in economic
cases, prices, and productivity, price
stability, economic capacity, and the
like with the object of reaching com-
mon ground in regard to them so that
we could spell out a single view on
behalf of us all. We have, however,
thought it proper not to prolong our
efforts to reach common ground on
these subjects, important though this
would be, because even more impor-
tantly we have been able to reach
common ground on the two practical
questions remaining for decision, namely
whether the total wage should be in-
creased and if so by what amount.”
So, miraculously, without knowing
how or why, all three Commissioners
latched on to the magic figure of $1.35.
They do, however, tell us that before-
hand they had “given serious consider-
ation” to eight factors and they listed:
price movement, the state of the
economy, rises in work-value cases, the
position of employers, the Common-
wealth’s views, the position of primary
producers, the public interest, and “in
the final result the capacity of the
economy to pay.”
There is, of course, not a hint of how
these factors bore on the decision. And,
since the Commission admits it couldn’t
work out its views on the relevance of
these different items after a bit of a
discussion, it is clear that it has been
just a case of the learned legal gents
pulling a figure out of their wigs.
The Commission in its nonchalance
has made no estimate of the impact of
the increase on the economy. But the
best advice we can get from the Govern-
ment in Canberra is that it will pass
through to almost all the nation’s
4,300,000 wage and salary earners and
will raise the wages bill by $250m., or
2 percent, to a figure of $13.6 billion
this financial year. The Treasury has
been hoping the rise would be only $1
and on this basis they were calculating
that average wages would rise by 5.5
percent this year. Now it looks like
being closer to 6 percent and, since pro-
ductivity will grow by only 2.5 percent,
this means that wage costs will rise by
3.5 percent. Profit margins have, if any-
thing, been falling over the past year,
so it wouldn’t be surprising if the rate
of price increase rises this year goes
over 4 percent —which is getting un-
comfortably high.
CREDIT CARDS
ELECTRONIC MONEY
THOSE MOST CONSERVATIVE of
institutions, the Australian banks, are
preparing to commit themselves still
further to an electronic future. In the
discussions now afoot on taking the
plunge into a credit-card system they
are not making the extravagant claims
of the American pioneers that the cash-
cheque system we know today will be
defunct within another 15 years. They
do imply, however, that the develop-
ment of a national and perhaps inter-
national system of electronic money
and credit transfer is now inevitable.
Credit-card systems in other countries
are already proving a useful exercise in
getting the banks, business, and the
public in general accustomed to the
full-scale operation of an automated
payment system.
It is difficult to think of small every-
day transactions being carried out by
a more efficient system than that of
small-change. But the increasingly
massive amounts of currency in circu-
lation present ever greater physical
and security proble'ms in humping it
around from place ta place. Similarly,
as far as the general public is con-
cerned, the use of cheques as proof of
payment on a larger scale could hardly
be improved upon in terms of simpli-
city and convenience. And yet the
flow of cheques into the clearing houses
of the banks each year is steadily
stretching their handling powers to
breaking point despite the present aid
of computerised accounts; chaos is
never very far away.
Such considerations have already
prompted many banks in the U.S. to
establish credit-card systems, the
$U.5.3400 million cost of clearing
17,000 million cheques each year pro-
viding a sharp accent to the belief that
Mr. Justice Gallagher and Sir Richard
Kirby: from conversation piece to
common ground?
the present system must evolve to
survive.
The establishment of credit-card
systems by the banks is only the first
tentative step in that evolution. On
the one hand it has been estimated that
in the two brief years since the idea
began to catch on in the U.S. some 59
percent of the American public have
come to carry credit cards, some 1500
banks are either conducting their own
card system or hold a franchise to issue
the cards of another bank, and some
424,000 merchants and other payees
have been drawn into the system. On
the other hand, only one third of the
credit-card accounts in existence are
considered “active,” only two percent of
the total consumer credit handled by
the banks is accounted for in this way,
and the distribution of the payees can
hardly be considered nation-wide, with
the West Coast accounting for about a
half of them and the Chicago area
another quarter.
In brief, one of the most credit-
conscious nations in the world is prov-
ing resistant to credit cards. The
system is having to be sold to the
general public and the payees. And in
the process the attitudes of the banks
toward credit is undergoing a sea-
change. The traditional banking men
who were originally brought in to run
the credit-card departments were


found to be too strict in approving
credit and following up delinquent
accounts. The softer approach of the
merchants was found to be more suc-
cessful, and the credit men fro’m the
retail stores are being brought into the
banks.
There is, too, the multiplicity of
unaffiliated* credit cards seemingly
tending to defeat the “convenience”
aspect of the exercise by providing the
well-travelled businessman with a full
pack to shuffle through; mergers, take-
overs, and affiliations have tended to
provide sojne relief. And then there
is the problem of reliable identification.
The 1.5 million U.S. credit cards lost
or stolen annually are thought to
account for upwards of $2O million of
fraudulent credit being issued; while
the on-line national credit system, let
alone the computers to scan and
identify signatures or analyse an in-
dividual voice pattern, is still very much
a figment of the future.
Such problems and the complex
mechanical details of running credit-
card systems are now being chewed
over by the Australian banks, follow-
ing a month’s close study in the U.S.
Within four months some official
announcements could be forthcoming,
and in a couple of years some positive
steps may have been taken. The
“chequeless” society may yet prove to
be something more than a hallucina-
tion of the computer manufacturers.
MEN AND MATTERS
RACING BEING a multi-million-dollar
business, it is the contention of
Flinders Lane textile magnate Tom
Trevaskis that the best people to run it
are active business people, not leisurely
old gentlemen in retirement. Whether
he will prove his point to enough
VATC 'members to break into the six-
man committee of that club is an open
question at the moment. But Mr.
Trevaskis has met with more success
than most people since he left the
Brunswick Technical School when he
was fourteen, 42 years ago (he was
born in North Melbourne), to work
for a tailor in Flinders Lane. He’s been
there all his life, starting the Trevola
garment business, now the biggest of
its kind in Australia, with his mother
when he was eighteen.
Although Trevola, with its nest of
proprietary companies covering the
various facets of the garment trade
A. C. B. Maiden
Tom Trevaskis
from manufacturing and importing
through to wholesaling, is Travaskis’
main business activity, there are plenty
of others. One of them is Oasis, just
round the corner from the Lane, which
he set up nine years ago along the
lines of the famous Japanese physical-
culture institutes he’d seen in his wrest-
ling days. Of course, he has another
former wrestling ace, Bonny Muir, run-
ning it. His own wrestling career was
outstanding with a host of world,
Australian, and Victorian amateur titles
to his credit in a long career that was
interrupted only by his service in the
Army when, for several years, he was
with the 2/sth commando unit through-
out its arduous Pacific campaigns.
For Mr. Trevaskis racing is big busi-
ness, and he concentrates his activities
in it around his property at Monmeith,
out past Sandown. Altogether, since the
family entered the business 31 years
ago, they’ve raced about 60 horses,
they’ve got big interests in several stal-
lions and own 20 brood mares, as well
as having 16 horses in training at the
mo'ment. Monmeith Lodge, covering
about 150 acres, was bought from the
Eisendal family three years ago (it
was the home of the famous mare
Lily), and is now conducted
by Trevaskis as an agistment farm. In
fact, it is one of the best in Victoria,
even if Mr. Trevaskis is not saying how
much he has spent in improving it, on
fencing, irrigation, ring yards,
veterinary-treatment buildings, auto-
matic feeding devices, and so forth.
Although it didn’t win at Sandown last
Wednesday, his horse’s name Tremen-
dous seems to sum up pretty well the
amount of time, 'money, and energy
he has put into racing, and, indeed, the
whole career of yet another “State
school kid.”
AFTER A $30,000 world-wide search,
another Australian, Mr. Alfred C. B.
Maiden, Secretary of the Department of
Primary Industry, has emerged from
hundreds of willing Americans, Britons,
New Zealanders, and South Africans to
succeed Mr. W. J. Vines in the
managing director’s chair at the Inter-
national Wool Secretariat.
The woolgrowers are amazed.
Although they have to accept that their
hopes for “a practical wool man” to
lead the,m out of their cost and market-
ing difficulties are thin (perhaps un-
realistic, too), their anticipation of a
top business executive to fill the post
was based on an advertising campaign
which called for “. . . a successful
commercial career . . . head of a com-
pany marketing consumer goods . . .
international business experience.” On
the face of things, a last-minute change
of direction away from marketing has
occurred at the IWS. According to the
chairman, Sir William Gunn, Mr.
Maiden “has the kind of administrative
skills” which could fulfil the need to
consolidate the promotional and tech-
nical activities of the IWS.
And in a broader view Mr. Maiden
has plenty of experience to fit him to
the job as advertised. Prior to his six
years with the Department of Primary
Industry, he was director of the Bureau
of Agricultural Econo,tnics for three.
His international experience includes
two years as Australian Commercial
and Agricultural Attache in Washington
to 1953, and as Commercial Counsellor
and Trade Com'missioner in Washing-
ton in 1957-58. In 1962 Maiden
knocked back a position as Assistant-
Director of the United Nations’ Food
and Agriculture Organisation to take
up his present position.
Born at Taree 46 years ago, Maiden
has the appropriate country origin. He
was educated at Taree High School
and at New England University
College, where he obtained a Bachelor
of Arts degree. He served with the AIF
from 1941-45.
Mr. Maiden’s present home is in Can-
berra, and if the forthcoming move to
London deprives him to some extent
from indulging his interests in garden-
ing and tennis, a salary almost doubled
to the region of $32,000 will, no doubt,
provide some consolation.
JAPAN'S ECONOMY
VERY ROBUST GROWTH
THERE SHOULD BE some deter-
mined smiles on the lips of Australian
exporters for a change. The “never-
ever-so-good” boom which is currently
startling Japanese business leaders-
sneaked up through the gloomy
prophecies of January and February
to confront them in their October
bank balances, production schedules,
trade figures, and investment programs.
Last week the small investors weighed
in with cheerful force to move the
Tokyo share market to an all-time
high and bring down upon themselves a
healthy flood of cautious warnings from
the Ministry of Finance and the Bank
of Japan.
At the halfway mark of the fiscal
year, the Government’s Economic
Planning Agency (EPA) and various
banks have happily revised their esti-
mates of the year’s real growth in
Japan’s Gross National Product. The
EPA, which had predicted an advance
of 7.4 to 8 percent, is now forecasting
a real growth of 9.3 to 9.6 percent
But the most drastic switch was made
by the Sumitomo Bank, which revised
its estimate from 6.3 percent in
January to 11.1 percent in late Sep-
tember.
A 10 percent improvement would
be only fractionally less than Japan
achieved in 1966 and 1967, and more
than double the worldwide average.
And it would delay by still another year

BPI 9 B
the levelling-off at 7 or 8 percent that
most economic analysts inside and out-
side Japan have, for the past few years,
regarded as inevitable.
Certainly, a host of indicators now
show a bright green light for a Japa-
nese economy that has had its brakes
on for most of 1968. Spurting exports
have shot the balance of payments
far out of the red, the domestic mar-
ket is brisk, big companies are plan-
ning heavy equipment investments, and
the central Bank of Japan will this
month remove the ceiling on develop-
ment loans from city banks.
A more specific indicator of coming
Japanese business activity is the steel
industry. Member companies of the
Japan Iron and Steel Federation are
working on an 8 percent increase
in steel sales in the October-March
period. They expect the heavier demand
to come mainly from the domestic
automobile, machinery, and construc-
tion sectors. (This would put Japan’s
steel production for the year at 68
to, 69' million tons, well above the
64.5 million tons originally predicted.)
The Japan Development Bank, in a
nationwide survey of 3145 companies,
has found that expansion plans worth
$U.5.5680 million will have been
carried out in the year to March 31,
1969 27.6 percent up on the pre-
vious year. The petrochemical industry
leads with 76 percent over the pre-
vious year. Then come cement, 69
percent; petroleum refining, 59 percent;
and general machinery, 47 percent.
Surprisingly, the steel, automobile,
and electrical industries will invest only
slightly more than the year before. But
the overall picture is one of robust
growth.
found initially in the area of shrinking
migration into the State and the move-
ment of people interstate out of S.A.
Compared with 1965, S.A.’s migrant
intake last year showed a drop of some
36 percent to 14,331. And although
interstate 'movements, are not clearly
documented it would appear 8 that S.A.
suffered an overall loss of at least
6000 people during 1967-68 through
this process. The impact on housing
demand was obviously one of major
severity.
But other more easily avoidable
factors were at work, too. Despite warn-
ings in 1966 that housing demand
would drop drastically, builders and
particularly the S.A. Housing Trust
applied no brakes whatsoever and an
economically sickening excess of un-
occupied houses has inevitably de-
veloped, with the Housing Trust
accounting for somewhere between 600
(official) and 1500 (unofficial) of these.
Behind the warning lay a marked
falling off in the high growth rate pre-
viously experienced in the State. A
lack of confidence in business prospects
developed; the value of factory con-
struction fell from $2O million in 1965
to $l2 million last year; employment
opportunities became limited with
registered unemployment more than
doubling to 8359 in the past three
years and registered vacancies shrink-
ing to a third of their 1965 figure. Not
only did people become reluctant to
purchase new homes or become in-
volved in other large financial com-
mitments, the interstate outflow fro'm
S.A. increased accordingly and an un-
favorable climate for overseas migrant
intake was achieved. On top of all this
came the drought and an unsettled
political atmosphere.
All this added up to a severe fall
in demand for housing at which point
the downward spiral of the economy
accelerated -- falling house purchases
cut sales and income over a wide area
of the economy and a further reduction
or delay in the demand for housing
resulted.
It will be no easy matter to pull
the State back to the high growth
rates of a few years ago. Things will
improve a little because the drought
has broken. But the State has severe
limitations in its resources of arable and
grazing land, water, and minerals, and
if the required development is to be
achieved it will have to be in the
manufacturing industries. And this,
according to the HIA, would be depen-
dent on sucessfully penetrating inter-
state and overseas markets through a
combination of Government and in-
dustrial effort. The HIA suggests that
from the Commonwealth should come
an intensified program of mineral
exploration, increased Federal spend-
ing in S.A., and a special committee
of inquiry which “the economic prob-
lems facing South Australia are serious
enough to warrant.” Only when these
problems are overcome will housing
construction recover its former health.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
HOUSING DOLDRUMS
THE INTERPLAY of fundamental
economic forces at work behind what
is ostensibly a severe fall in housing
construction in South Australia is
expertly analysed in a recent report
from the Housing Industry Association
to illustrate why housing serves so well
as a sensitive, general econo.mic indi-
cator. And, although after examing
the main threads in the story the HIA
forecasts an improvement in general
economic conditions for South Australia
in 1968-69, it seems probable that it
will be some time yet before the deep-
seated economic problems are over-
come there and the fortunes of the
building industry reversed.
The decline was indeed remarkable.
Although Australia as a whole has
increased its annual residential com-
pletion rates by some 7 percent over
the past few years, that in South Aus-
tralia has dropped by 37.6 percent, a
fall in construction from almost 13,000
dwellings in 1965 to what looks like
being about 8000 this current year.

Speculator’s Diary
A FIRST PICKING
FROM THE
RUINS OF THE BOOM
NOW THAT DISASTER has hit so
many boonmtime favorites (including,
I’m afraid, severalin my portfolio), it
can be a worthwhile venture to scrounge
among the ruins in 1 the hope of finding
some valuable pieces of wreckage.
Last week’s London - backed rally
seemed to be along these lines. But
there were some stocks that did riot
share in the rally and that are looking
even cheaper.
One of the Worst-hit mining stocks
in the recent shake-out does not appear
in the mining lists at all. It is
McDonald Industries, the engineering
company that has a 25 percent stake
in the Frances Creek iron-ore project.
At one stage this year, the shares were
up as high as $1.79, but under some
consistent selling, particularly from one
broking house in Sydney that seems to
know a fair amount about iron ore,
the shares have fallen to only 98 cents,
or down almost 45 percent in the past
few weeks. What looks particularly
ominous about this is that the annual
reshlt for 1967-68 is due out in a week
or so. I am one of those people who
always take a lot of notice of a falling
market immediately preceding an
annual report. This is particularly so
in the case of McDonald, whose earlier
heights had been due to iron-ore pros-
pects even though it did not get any
benefit at all from its iron-ore mining
Contract at Frances Creek in the first
half of the year, when it reported a
net profit of $131,463 —only moder-
ately better than the profit earned
in the same period of the previous year.
When the result was released in March
this year, directors said that although
the Frances Creek contract was not yet
showing a profit it was expected that
this position would be corrected during
the next six months, because there had
been some improvement in the railway
system and this should continue during
the year.
Before this it had been impossible
to move the required tonnages from
the mine to Darwin to keep up with
the contract with the Japanese because
of the inadequacies of the Common-
wealth Government railways. This had
meant that in 1966-67 the Frances
Creek operation had lost $87,946.
Since March, there has been no indi-
cation from the company about
whether things have improved as ex-
pected or not. The strong burst of
recent selling suggests that someone
thinks they have not.
But frankly I am not as gloomy about
McDonalds as the market is, for two
reasons. In the first place, it does
not matter all that much whether the
company’s Frances Creek operations
have come . good in time to bring in-
creased rewards in 1967-68 accounts,
even though a failure to do so will be
disappointing, AU that really matters
is that it comes good by 1969. For
the Frances Creek operation is not just
a one-year event; it is a medium-term
affair.
But its 25 percent stake in Frances
Creek is not the only way McDonalds
makes money out of this area; it also
does the mining and crushing contract
and this will probably return it some-
thing like 30 cents per ton. When the
throughput of iron ore gets up to the
600,000 tons a year mark (which was
expected by late this year), then Mc-
Donalds should earn about $lBO,OOO
a year from the contract. So, from
next year on, McDonalds should be
making about $555,000 from its Frances
Creek interests.
There is no doubt the market has
been looking to a big increase in profits
from McDonald Industries this year
and it will be very disappointed if
Frances Creek has not contributed to
it. In addition, shareholders no doubt
expect some increase in the 4 per-
cent dividend that was paid last year
out of the 19 percent earning rate.
But even if the iron-ore operation is
still a disappointment the market
should not take it too badly and the
shares, to my mind, could well get up
around the $1.50 mark again early
next year when the interim report re-
veals, as it should, that the iron-ore
operation is going well—at last.
To pay for these and to get liquid,
I decided to lessen the weight that
natural resources stocks have in the
portfolio by selling half my holdings
of Mt. Isa and Western Collieries,
even though I expect them both to do
better. Isa earned me $3l and Western
Collieries $234. And as Kolotex seems-
to have gone off the boil, I sold to make
a profit of $ll5.
This leaves kitty at $2484.

two-inch thick Stramit board were employed in this project designed to endure for at least two-hundred years.
Only Stramit’s unique products and construction Systems met the architect’s rigid aesthetic requirements ... as well
as fulfilling all the specifications in regard to sound and temperature insulation, weight, economy, and corrosion
resistance. A highlight of the Stramit Systems versatility was the inclusion of a large number of roof-lighting units
directing natural light into the heart of the Centre. In homes as well as in Art Centres, Stramit puts more of your
building money into materials, less into labour. If you have a construction problem, mail the coupon for free Stramit
brochures ... or better still, phone or call at your Stramit Centre and speak with a trained technical adviser.

BRIEFLY
The GCOnomy .* Somehow or other the Commonwealth
Arbitration Commission hit upon $1.35 as the weekly in-
crease to the minimum total wage; the criteria are as vague
as the judgment.
September’s trade deficit reached $70.8 million, the
highest monthly figure since August 1961 ’s $73.4 million;
imports at $310.7 million stood against exports of
$239.9 million. The first three months of 1968-69 show
a $133.3 million trading deficit, to compare with 1967-68’s
corresponding $85.8 million.
Fully assembled cars imported into Australia during
August were worth $5.5 million, or $1.3 million above July;
more vehicles came from West Germany and Italy,
fewer from Japan.
Increased costs may bring Australian equity in the Gove
alumina project under the present 50 percent . . . It’s
not proving easy to legislate against possible foreign
ownership of the MLC Ltd.; meanwhile, the big English-
owned Sun Alliance group confesses to a 20.9 percent
holding.
The markets: Some portion of the hectic decline of
Australian share markets seemed to be arrested over most
trading days last week; the picture became a good deal
less certain on the Friday, however, when many of the
improving metals, in particular, took another knock.
Yet there were quite a few thankful net additions on the
full week. BHP, to much relief, put on $l.BO to close at
$18.75. Among the recoveries were also: CRA $18.30
(up $3.20); Peko $ll.BO ($1.20); King Island Scheelite
$13.20 (70 cents); Western Mining $10.70 ($1.10); Mount
Isa $7.40 (60 cents); Hamersley $12.10 ($1.70); and
BH South $5.25 (65 cents). Great Boulder went back
a further $2.50 to $l2 and oils turned down obviously
on Friday.
Some industrial rises included R. W. Miller, up 51
cents to $2.21; Thiess, up 41 cents to $3.91, and Captain
Product’s 50 cent jump to $3.50.
Blue chips and top internationals pushed ahead in London,
where Australian miners were very indecisive.
Exuberance has been the word on Wall Street, yet
leaders were looking mixed at the finish.
Companies: The urge to get together on the Adams
Hotel (Sydney) site revealed policy differences between
developers Stocks and Holdings and Lanray Industries, so
Lanray is to carry on alone . . . The drive has continued
among a lot of other parties, though . . . The
Hotel Metropole will be under another siege from Hooker
Corporation, whose new bid at $4.45 cash a share is 40
cents more than June’s defeated offer . . . Thomas Nation-
wide Transport is actively using the market to lift
its holding in R. W. Miller, where directors also are
trying to increase their holdings in riposte; the Miller group’s
earnings have slipped once more—from $1,677,742 to
$1,603,494 . . . The board of Sydney Mutual Insurance still
appears keen to accept the embrace of Daniel K. Ludwig’s
Clutha Development and scornfully rejects a bid for 50 per-
cent of their capital from Lawrence J. Adler’s Fire and
All Risks Insurance, not least because the latter is well
below the market price . . . Retail chemist (and investor)
Washington H. Soul Pattinson is after the shares it does
not already own in financier Deposit Investment
in a bid worth $11.4 million, which curiously offers D. and
I. shareholders debentures in their own company.
“Mass media” came well into the news . . . Television
Corporation, now the holding company for Channel
9 television and the “Daily Telegraph” publishing group,
sent profit to more than $3.4 million—substantially
above the comparable figures for 1966-67 . . . The John
Fairfax group reported earnings up by 10.7 percent
to $3,388,781 after higher tax and depreciation . . . The
Adelaide-based News group went up by 11.3 percent to
$2,501,936; its Sydney interest, Mirror Newspapers,
saw profit move from $595,149 to $802,545 and dividend
from 10 to 15 percent . . . The third Sydney com-
mercial TV, United Telecasters, lost $594,639 — halving
1966-67’s $1,261,839 loss—and believes “the adverse trend
has been corrected.”
An enthusiastically awaited report from Great Boulder-
North Kalgurli on Scotia and other nickel proved largely
disappointing ... Two rutile miners, Cudgen RZ and
Mineral Deposits, have not come up to expectations — Cudgen
earning about half its prospectus forecast and Mineral
Deposits slipping back for the first half of 1968.
Sydney builder James Wallace found its profit down
from $368,679 to $301,026 and again missed the dividend
“because of cash needs”; contracts on hand are higher
than a year before . . . The Mainline construction group
proposes to list soon as Mainline Corporation after a
public placement . . . Earnings of the diverse engineering
and coal enterprise Thiess Holdings retreated from
$2,045,256 to $1,956,807, yet the dividend went pleasantly
from 10 to 12| percent.
In a meticulously backgrounded report, Ford Motor Co.
of Australia announced a $5,987,554 profit for the half-
year to June on record sales of $110.7 million; the corres-
ponding 1967 profit, at $5,819,398, did not suffer tax as
a consequence of earlier losses.
Right in the rural line of fire, meat wholesaler and
retailer T. A. Field improved from $361,928 to $582,236
and lifted dividend from 6 to 1\ percent ... As earlier
foreshadowed, tax brought Myer Emporium’s earnings
down by 5 percent to $12,846,000 —the first post-tax drop
in 11 years.

It’s only 50 years ago that Electrolytic
Zinc Company produced the first high
grade zinc in Australia now each
year Australia uses more zinc per head
of population than any other country
in the world. Around twice as much in
fact. In that time E.Z.’s experience,
its attention to product quality and
service, and its development of valuable
overseas markets have made it a great
earner for Australia and Australians.
E.Z. plans to keep it that way.

THE LAND
Lightening the burden
of land tax
WHATEVER DREADFUL THINGS
are happening to farmers in other direc-
tions, at least they can count their
lucky stars that taxation on their
properties is being lightened. The recent
State Budgets abolished a land tax on
land used for primary production,
reduced it substantially in N.S.W. with
a promise of phasing it out altogether
over a three-year period, while else-
where and also in N.S.W. the range of
exemptions to it were widened. Show-
ing more sympathy than the Federal
Government to rural problems, the
State Budgets also generally turned a
blind eye to big railway deficits (not-
ably high in Victoria) by eschewing
any increases in freight rates to further
aggravate the farmers’ costs problems.
The short reason for the the more
magnanimous treatment of farmers by
State Treasurers is, of course, that
they’ve found a sure-fire money-spinner
in the receipts tax and into the bargain
some of them have the certain pros-
pect of lucrative sums coming in from
royalties on minerals.
Of course, farmers, like every other
business, will bear part of the receipts
tax burden, but even with this offset
they come out of the latest tax play
very well, too well according to some
taxation authorities who are quick to
point out that there has been a six to
sevenfold increase in average primary
production land values in the last 20
years and that farmers could reap enor-
mous tax-free capital gains should they
choose to sell out at any time. They
also point out that while farmers are
absolved from or are having the burden
of land tax lightened, there is to be no
relief for other property in the country
either business or residential. Indeed, in
Victoria land tax on other property
above a certain valuation is to be
increased to compensate for revenue
lost by abolishing the tax on primary
production land.
If all this adds up to discrimination
in the farmers’ favor, rural organisa-
tions are not apologising or, indeed,
simply resting their defences for it
on the ti'me-worn arguments about
secondary industry protection, and
those related to the present easier
trends in world prices for their
products, and to the exchange rate.
Another of their defences is that land
taxes are wrong in principle, anyway,
in that they are tied to capital values
rather than to the earnings yielded by
the assets in question. It is further
being complained that the error in
principle has been compounded in
practice as a result of the steep rises
in land values on which the tax is
calculated, not to speak of substantial
increases in actual land tax rates over
the years.
The most forceful case on this aspect
has been put up by Mr. A. B. Wood,
one of the presidents of the Victorian
Farmers’ Union, who, after damning
land tax as “a tax on an individual’s
capacity to earn income and a tax
on the most important capital item in a
farmer’s operation his land,” attacks
it because valuations on which the tax
is collected involve the exercise of
human judgment (which is surely
quite silly) and because valuations are
often artificial and unrealistic. His
point is that “an unreal level of prices
created by the sale of land in a district
for unreasonably high figures reflects
on the valuation of all properties in
the area: such prices may be paid
by farmers acquiring adjoining property
or through purchase by ‘Collins
Street Farmers.’ There is an automatic
reaction on the part of municipalities
to increase shire valuations and farmers
are therefore taxed and rated on
fictitious values which do not relate to
the productivity value of their land.”
Tax authorities point out that this
is rather overstating the flow-on of high
prices for sales of land into official
valuations of farm land, and that in
any case there is a certain equity in
the assessment of capital appreciation
in land values on property that can
be sold at any time without the pro-
ceeds from it attracting taxation.
Indeed, the more you look at land tax
the more blurred becomes the distinc-
tion between it being a tax on capital
assets and one on their earnings cap-
acity, and the clearer becomes the case
for alleviating farmers of the burden
of it just now simply because of their
mounting costs and profit-margin diffi-
culties. Given that, there’s certainly not
much in Mr. Wood’s claim that land
tax is bad because land is “a far more
important factor of production for
primary producers than it is for second-
ary industry,” at least unless it can be
proved that taxation on the appreciation
of capital asset is in itself bad. Remem-
bering that depreciation is tax allow-
able, the distinction between pri’mary
and secondary industry assets largely
disappears, the more so because farm-
ing is becoming increasingly mechan-
ised.
As was well illustrated by the fact
that Victoria would have to find only
$2 million more from land tax on non-
primary industry property to maintain
its $l9 million overall receipts from
land tax this financial year, it is clear
not only that the burden of land tax
on primary industry has been very
small relatively to that on other land,
but also that given the higher level
of exemptions on non-primary industry
land the effect of recouping that $2
million will be to impose a heavy addi-
tional burden (up to 25 percent on
former assessments in the worst cases)
on those still liable to pay the tax.
Victoria is, of course, the only State to
be making such reassessments this
year, but presumably this will eventu-
ally happen in N.S.W. as well.
AGRISEARCH
GRAZING ON THE ORD
AFTER AN EIGHT-YEAR struggle
the Ord River Catchment Regenera-
tion Project is now clearly winning the
battle against erosion. The decisive
factor, according to Mr. K. Fitz Gerald,
adviser, North-west Division, Western
Australian Department of Agriculture,
has been the completion of the fencing
program and the exclusion of cattle
from the Catchment. Some 450 miles
of cattle fence have been built to form
18 vast paddocks. Another 100 miles
of fencing isolates a further large sec-
tion of country which still awaits the
regeneration treatment. Although plant
cover has been established on many

of the extensive denuded areas, the
amount of silt being carried in the
waters of the Ord River is still as high
as ever. Unless it is greatly reduced,
the life of the projected irrigation
scheme must be seriously limited.
Engineers, presumably, are busily cal-
culating siltation rates so that in due
course they can let us know just how
long they expect the scheme to
survive.
However, now that the regenerative
processes have really begun it should
be only a matter of time until the silt
problem is largely overcome. Once
active erosion is checked, control
usually proceeds at an accelerating
pace, and all may be well eventually.
The areas being treated have lately
been resumed and gazetted as Water
Catchment Reserves. Indeed, Mr.
Fitz Gerald believes that the success
of the revegetation project is now
assured. He even believes that in years
to come the Catchment could again be
released for grazing under licence,
subject to close supervision and strin-
gent control.
When the explorer Alexander Forrest
entered the Kimberley region in 1879
he spoke of having seen “the best pas-
ture lands of the colony.” In view of
the tragic happenings since, it is salutary
to recount his observations. He wrote:
“We found spread out before us the
most splendid grassy plain it has ever
been my lot to see. As far as the eye
could reach was one vast level expanse
of magnificent feeding ground. This is,
in my estimation, the finest part of
Western Australia that I have seen,
and I hope that before long it will
be covered with flocks and herds.” His
hopes were only too well realised. Dur-
ing the 1880 s 'mobs of cattle were over-
landed from as far away as Queensland,
South Australia, and even New South
Wales. These cattle were allowed to
multiply unchecked and soon the
natural perennial pastures of Mitchell
and blue grasses began to fail under
the grazing pressure. Inferior annual
pastures replaced them in some areas; in
others, especially along the river and
stream frontages, where grazing was
heaviest and trampling most severe,
denudation was complete. The Turner
Plain, a large area in the East Kim-
berleys, for instance, lost all its vegeta-
tion and much of its topsoil. Before
the new cattle industry could return
enough capital for improvements and
development, productivity began to
decline steeply. The advent of pleuro,
cattle tick, and red-water fever hastened
the rundown. For many years now
the turnoff of cattle from the Kimber-
leys has only just exceeded that of the
top end of the Northern Territory,
where the turnoff at between nine and
eleven percent is the lowest in Austra-
lia, if not in the world.
With the coming of the road trains,
improved killing works at Wyndham,
Broome, and Derby, new markets,
control of the diseases, the revegetation
project, the possibility of using by-
products from the Ord Irrigation Area,
and a research program aimed at
developing appropriate pasture and
cattle management systems, better days
are certainly in store for the Kimber-
ley cattle industry. Nevertheless, as
Mr. Fitz Gerald says of the Regenera-
tion Project, although much has been
done, much remains to be done.
Throughout most of the region the
cattle are still regarded as feral animals
and not subjected to even the most
rudimentary 'management practices.
Fences are a prime need everywhere
and the cattlemen will simply have to
find the money for them somehow. The
550 miles of fencing in the Regenera-
tion Project have cost about $490 a
mile. The per acre cost varies, of
course, with the size of the paddock
enclosed, but a ten-mile square (64,000
acres) works out at about 30 cents an
acre. Where reseeding with cultivation
is needed the cost seems to be of
the order of 70 cents an acre, without
allowing for depreciation and interest
charges on the 'machinery. Thus, for
an outlay of a dollar an acre big
changes can be wrought if the Regen-
eration Project is any guide.
In the Project area revegetation has
been accomplished by means of strip
cultivation along the contour. A total
of at least 50,000 miles of furrows has
been ploughed in the Ord Catchment
and reseeded mainly with a mixture
of buffel and Birdwood grasses and
kapock bush. Kapock seed may be col-
lected locally at very low cost by
means of a vacuum-type machine; the
mixed grass seed has been bought in
bulk at prices between 35 and 50 cents
a pound. Seeding rates of up to 41b.
per mile of furrow have been used
with buffel and Birdwood seed com-
prising about half the mixture. The
kapock bush has proved to be a very
effective coloniser. It produces a
copious supply of light, fluffy seed,
which is disseminated by the wind into
the areas between the furrows. Good
seasons in the past two years have
accounted for a major part of the
success. Places where the topsoil has
been largely removed are naturally
more recalcitrant and regeneration is
a long, slow process.
Research on the cattle has shown
that both the meatworks and the
station owners will have to change their
policy. It is apparently unrealistic to
aim at raising cattle to high slaughter
weights on the unimproved Kimberley
pastures. A beast can be got to 9001 b.
in three years, but it may take as much
as another two years for it to gain
a further 1001 b. It also appears that
the ancestors of the original shorthorns
brought to the region are well adapted
in certain important respects and are
superior in some ways to the Santa
Gertrudis, which have recently been
introduced. The local shorthorns can
continue to gain weight when the feed
contains as little as 3.4 percent
protein, but the Santa Gertrudis need a
minimum of 5.1 percent to put on
flesh. And under hard conditions their
reproductive performance is inferior
also. But these are relatively minor
considerations.


INVESTMENT
The Markets
HOW NOT TO ATTRACT
FUNDS TO THE
"MILK BAR" ECONOMY
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS • OIL TABLE
THERE IS PROBABLY no relation-
ship, but the great sharemarket shake-
out of September 27 came just four
days after the Prime Minister, Mr.
Gorton, effectively put a stop to foreign
investment in the MLC Ltd., the
largest of Australia’s life offices with
shareholders. Any sharemarket recov-
ery since that bad Friday has been
unsure and hardly indicative of any
return of foreign investors. That is not
to say that the Government’s action
with the MLC has frightened away
overseas equity investors; they had
probably quit buying on Australian
markets some time before, anyhow. But
with the restiveness of the natives on
matters of giving Australians “a go” in
foreign-owned enterprise, a harder line
expressed on both sides of Parliament
than ever before, foreign buyers of
shares in bulk are unlikely to resume
the almost carefree attitudes that
marked the mineral boom of 1966-68.
The old merger group of Sun
Alliance and London Insurance Ltd.
surprisingly announced itself as the
beneficial owner of 20.9 percent of the
MLC shares after two weeks’ specula-
tion as to the mystery buyer of shares.
The announcement was brief and to the
point. It said purely that the
owned Sun Alliance group was the
owner of 20.9 percent of the capital
and that the group did not intend and
never had intended to make a take-
over bid nor acquire a majority
holding.
So much for the Government’s fear
that the movement of MLC shares into
nominee hands was the overture to a
takeover. For, there is no reason to
doubt Sun Alliance’s statement. It must
be remembered that the Sun Alliance,
while a large insurance group, is not of
sufficient size to take on the whole of
the MLC without bringing its invest-
ment portfolio into a great imbalance
of Australian assets over U.K. assets.
Indeed, it is only to be wondered what
reaction by the MLC board would
have followed an open acquisition of a
21 percent holding by the Sun Alliance
group. It does appear that the “faceless”
nature of the buying was the ultimate
worry.
It is now proposed to go ahead with
the amendments to the local Canberra
ordinance to make disclosure of nomi-
nee shareholders in the MLC manda-
tory. In this way we will find out evenu-
ally who are the holders of the other 10
percent of the shares so registered.
And, the Attorney-General intends to
pursue the clauses aimed at restricting
foreign holders to a certain percentage
of the Canberra-registered life office
companies (the MLC and the APA).
But these moves are secondary in a
market sense to the ruling that foreign
buyers after September 23 would not be
registered in the light of the subse-
quent legislation. No point, then, for
the Sun Alliance or anyone else for
that matter buying MLC shares after
September 23.
In the London boardroom of the
Sun Alliance sits as powerful a group of
investors as could be found. Australian
“friend” Evelyn de Rothschild is there.
His reaction to the Government protec-
tion of the MLC against the foreigner
is awaited with interest. The Roths-
child branch in London is a large
holder of various Australian scrip, and
is, one imagines, a potential market
force in Australia from time to time.
It is being reasonably asked around
the money capitals “Why the MLC?”
The Government will surely take simi-
lar preventative action if other institu-
tions are subject to any similar transfer
of shares, they say. And, the rider is
added that this is hardly the way to
attract equity investment from abroad.
The contentious issue of foreign
equity investment in Australia has
brought out much weighty and varied
opinion. Politically, it emerges that the
popular front is to insist on partnership,
no takeovers and behaviour consistent
with the requirements of the host
country. Practically, it would seem that
the popular appeal has little to recom-
mend it from the foreigner’s point of
view.
Now that the MLC is safely locked
in the “milk bar” economy, Federal
Government decisions on all sorts of
other enterprise under attack can be
based on the precedent. Forgotten in all
the brouhaha about the MLC is that
capital wears no flag, owes no allegi-
ance, and is concerned mostly with
making a pound. If Australia wants
capital and the balance of payments
over the next few years demands a very
high inflow rate or a belt-tightening
process then the attitudes about
accepting it will have to change.
THE CHARTIST SAYS: deposit and investment was originally
recommended as a technical buy in June, 1966, at price levels around 20 cents.
A target of 70 cents was then indicated and, at the same time, the fundamentalist
suggested: “It would take a very game investment analyst to suggest that Deposit
and Investment could ever regain an ultimate level of 70 cents.” In this case, the
charts proved correct and a high of 82 cents was achieved some weeks ago. How-
ever, in view of recent market action, the situation can be reassessed in terms of
a reversal of trend. Sales below 60 cents would be serious and a downside target
of approximately 40 cents would be a possibility in the short term. Last sale price
on 3.10.68.—65 cents.
GIBSON KELITE
TOO MANY PIES?
IN THE LONG RUN, earning-rate
trends provide a useful measuring
stick of the effects of acquisitions on a
company, even if it is seldom easy, and
often impossible, to single out in the
accounts of companies most prone to
expanding by this method the effect
of one particular acquisition from
those of all the others in the general
roll-up. In the case of takeovers by
share issues to vendors, companies are
usually put to stern test to maintain,
let alone increase, previous earning
rates on the increased share capital
involved, however confident they may
naturally have been at the start of a
takeover exercise. (Confidence would
presumably be higher when an acquisi-
tion involves hard cash, because share
issues are much easier and more likely
to stretch a bidder’s generosity despite


making the task for the earning rate
so much the harder.)
After the orgy of takeovers in
1960-61, mostly by the use of share
issues and resulting in a trail of extin-
guished earning rates, abuses of this
particular method of taking over com-
panies have been infrequent. One con-
cern with strong takeover hormones to
pass the earning-rate test since that
time is Gibson Kelite, the Melbourne-
based chemical products and water
engineer. It is now on the takeover trail
again after a three-years’ respite and
has acquired the family proprietary
Leonard Chemical Products (founded
by the present vendor, Mr. Keith
McEnercoe, in 1948) and two associ-
ated companies in what is largely a
share deal worth $1 million.
Since it was listed in 1960, Gibson
Kelite has only failed to increase its
earning rate in one year (1965-66),
though in that period its capital has
been increased by takeovers (notably of
the ailing T. S. Gill), as well as by
premium issues and the exercise of
options. The drop in 1965-66 was from
21.2 to 16.7 percent, after which an
offending subsidiary, Osco Pty. Ltd.,
was promptly disposed of. The only
snag about this test is that in Gibson
Kelite’s case its earning rate was bene-
fiting substantially from T. S. Gill’s
tax losses.
Anyway, tax losses or not, the com-
pany has not blotted its copybook in
the past two years, when the dividend
has been lifted in two leaps of 2 per-
cent to the present 14 percent. Although
the company has its fingers in rather
too many pies for our liking, and gets
into some more, such as sealants, dead-
ening compounds, and protective coat-
ings with the acquisition of the Leonard
Grpup, Mr. Victor Gibson seems quite
confident he can handle them all. A
couple of years ago he put his own
takover criteria forward: the acquisition
must have a strong affinity with exist-
ing operations and a strong earning-rate
enrichment capacity. Oddly enough,
however, the intention is apparently to
let the Leonard group, which is almost
as diversified as its new parent, operate
on its own.
DAVIES COOP-VIYELLA
A WATCHING BRIEF
DAVIES COOP’S board continues to
be on the alert about Viyella’s big
holding in the company. At the annual
meeting the chairman preferred to keep
sitting on the fence about it, saying,
somewhat enigmatically, “I can’t say
what they are holding it for, but we
are watching the situation very care-
fully.” One would imagine that Viyella,
following a long dividendless drought, is
not hanging on to its shares for fun.
So, what with Mr. Burt’s expressed
puzzlement, it could still be that Mr.
Haines is just biding his time for
another assault even if this is purely
conjectural at the moment. Meanwhile,
there is nothing for his representative
here to write home about the latest
result, which was about even with the
previous year’s, as was the dividend
which it covered by the slenderest of
margins. All of which makes it entirely
appropriate that the shares can be
bought to give a yield of ten percent
at their current price of 40 cents.
It was a revelation to hear at the
meeting that, despite Australia now
being pretty well self-sufficient in
cotton supplies (this year’s crop is
expected to be about 150,000 bales as
against only 11,000 four years ago),
local supplies were costing the group
more than import parity. Presumably,
the local price could go even higher
now the Government has decided to
reduce the $4 million cotton bounty by
stages over the next three years. If
Davies Coop may therefore have to
pay dearer for its local supplies of
cotton, this strengthens Mr. Burt’s case
that the Bounty Act be reframed to
ensure that spinners can continue to
select their cotton on a quality basis.
Anyway, Davies Coop is apparently
expecting to get something from the
Tariff Board as a result of the new
national self-sufficiency in raw cotton.
That is through the curtailment of
duty-free yarns, which would open new
doors for local spinners, of which it is
one of the biggest.
FORD AUSTRALIA
GUIDE TO FRANKNESS
WHAT THE MARKET would give
to have more Australian companies
following Ford’s shining example in its
latest interim statement. This tops a
comprehensive run-down of the term’s
financial experience with turnover
figures, complete with comparisons with
corresponding periods, and is rounded
off with a digest of the company’s trad-
ing experience against the background
of the whole industry, throwing in the
export figures for good measure. Not,
of course, that the picture given by
Ford this time is all roses for the
company, so the frankness is the more
commendable.
The after-tax profit improved a
shade, from $5,819,398 to $5,987,554
compared with the first half of 1967
(calendar year), but the comparison is
distorted by the fact that no taxation
provision was required in the first
half of 1967 when pre-tax profit was
about $4 million lower than in the
latest period, for which the group
managed to lift its profit-to-sales
ratio from 5.7 (1967) to 8.8 percent
(GM-H had one of 13.4 percent in
1957). Although new registrations have
eased off this quarter, there seems a
fair chance of Ford moving its profit-
to-sales ratio a bit higher in the cur-
rent six months, following the increase
in vehicle prices a few months ago.
Mining
GOLD IS THE STEADY
GLITTER BEHIND
LAKE VIEW AND STAR
WHEN THE CHAIRMAN of Lake
View and Star Ltd., Mr. S. L. Segal,
addresses the annual meeting in Syd-
ney this week, he will talk about two
metals very much the focus of public,
and investor, interest—gold and nickel.
Either one would, at this particular
moment, suffice to draw considerable
attention to Mr. Segal’s observations.
In combination they have naturally
pushed Lake View well to the forefront
in the recent share-market boom and
just as obviously dragged the shares
back as the extreme vigor of the boom
expired. The 43 cent (E. 4/-) shares-
have risen as high as a dizzy $8.40
this year, but now stand around $4.60.
At this level the basic reliability of the
company’s gold operations still sug-
gests reasonable prospects of short- to
medium-term capital appreciation.
That view, and the present share
price, plainly discount most chances-
of any rise in the price of official
gold in the near future. Indeed, specu-
lation based upon this possibility seems
to have been dissipated fairly quickly
by the latest International Monetary
Fund meetings. Yet it still remains a
hope behind every holder of gold
shares, especially while the pressures
on the world monetary system and
world liquidity are allowed to remain.
More to Lake View’s immediate ad-
vantage is that it is permitted to sell
its gold on the free world market,
where prices are likely for some time
to stay above the official monetary
level in spite of some of the manipula-
tions adumbrated at the IMF.
Neglecting the nickel leases, whose
(distant) prospects will be outlined
below, Lake View is one among the
very few Australian gold mining com-
panies to give the impression that it
can lift earnings from gold alone, what-
ever happens to the official price. Peko,
with its brilliant Juno field, is the out-
standing member of this small group.
Put briefly, Lake View appears at
present to be working at only about
three-quarter capacity, as a conse-
quence of labor and related problems,
but the yield per ton of ore is definitely
improving.
The block of gold leases consists of
1417 acres at Kalgoorlie (W.A.), served
by a modern treatment plant. The
neighbor mine, run by Great Boulder,
also suffers from the same problem of
excess mill capacity. In an attempt to
rationalise this side of their activities,
Lake View and Great Boulder actually
started to discuss a merger early in
1967. Following a thorough feasibility
study, talks were abandoned in Feb-

ruary this year. Prior to that, Mr. Segal
had made the position very plain: “We
have repeatedly said that the key to
our profitability and our main defence
against a rising cost structure lies in
increasing our milling rate. This should
bring about an overall reduction in
unit costs. We have a plant capable
of treating 920,000 tons per annum,
but last year (1967) we were only able
to feed it at just 80 percent of cap-
acity.” A principal cause of the trouble
is the shortage and relatively poor re-
tention of labor.
Housing and other amenities are per-
haps one key to overcoming this. “By
being able to offer homes to recruits we
hope to be able to strengthen and
stabilise our underground labor force,”
Mr. Segal has explained.
Be that as it may, Lake View can
still point to that higher yield. The
latest 1967-68 year saw 145,8840 z. of
gold recovered from 681,354 tons of
ore, whereas the previous year had
yielded only 142,5380 z. from 734,409
tons. The present ore reserves will be
disclosed this week; at June 30, 1967,
they stood close to 3J million tons at
an average grade 4.7dwts.
The better yield trend and larger
free market sales must continue to bring
their benefits to Lake View. Gains from
the “other” market selling could only
have had much impact in the latest
financial year from March [when the
“two-tier” pricing system began to
rule), yet the company was able to-
produce a 42.4 percent profit jump to
$451,900, giving earnings of 16.1 cents
a share comfortably to cover a steady
10 cents a share dividend. Most signi-
ficantly, the profit was achieved after
taking in a much lower gold subsidy—
ss46,92s compared with 1966-67’s
$750,884 —and for the first time getting
the full benefit of the lower tax stem-
ming from the company’s Australian
domicile, which commenced formally in
November, 1966. The 58-year-old com-
pany, previously domiciled in England
and subject to U.K. corporation tax,
can look forward to the more advan-
tageous tax allowances applying to
Australian gold miners.
This whole general picture has been
drawn without allowing any of the
ecstasies which accompany the con-
templation of an increase in the price
of gold. Almost without saying, Lake
View’s potential benefits therefrom are
tremendously substantial. A prudent in-
vestor, however, may prefer to dwell
upon the close situation, which looks
both assured and promising. Increasing
output and good grades appear
eminently likely in the current year,
while premium gold sales will almost
certainly be higher. Furthermore, the
Federal Budget makes it possible for
a part of premium prices obtained to
be kept by the company without deduc-
tion from the gold subsidy, a distinctly
favorable move for Lake View.

Together with Consolidated Gold Fields
Australia, which has the major 70 per-
cent interest, Lake View possesses sole
prospecting rights over Ministerial
Reserve No. 3811 H, south of Lake
Rebecca, some 70 miles north-east of
Kalgoorlie, and having an area of 420
square miles. W.A. Government
geologists have found traces of nickel
in two 300-acre areas near the Lake
Rebecca Reserve. The Lake View-
CGFA agreement, effective from late
1967, provides for a two-year evaluation
program. An option permits abandon-
ment of exploration after one year; this
has not been exercised and the share
market has perhaps taken a little too
much heart from that fact.
The joint venturers have been quite
straightforward in talking about their
prospect, so investors should be cool-
headed and patient. Only last month
came the statement that no significant
finds have been made, target areas
have been located, and diamond drill-
ing has not yet begun. Shallow augur
drilling, deeper percussion drilling, and
geological surveys are continuing.
The two companies also share three-
year options over 12,000 acres near
Parker Hill and 17,500 acres around
the general Kalgoorlie area.
After the feverish excitement of the
nickel boom, investors for some time
will be forced to concentrate most of
their interest upon the traditional gold
operations. Earnings from these could
perhaps reach 25 cents a share and
the dividend is more than assured. The
nickel hopes certainly represent well
under $1 of the present share price and
constitute the sheer speculative element
in Lake View.

Journal
MTC Pty. Ltd., seemed to be intent
on proving him wrong. In a bid to save
the situation, TDG tried to take over
TNT. But the Reserve Bank of Aus-
tralia rejected a share-exchange deal,
and in a reverse takeover TNT bought
the Cargo companies for $6 million
cash, payable in terms of 3 million
shares at $1 premium, and the balance
in a 10-year loan. TDG emerged with
a 32 percent slice of TNT’s capital.
The dynamic management of Mr.
Ken W. Thomas, sole founder of TNT,
was the immeasurable asset which first
attracted TDG. Foiled in their original
takeover intentions through official
Australian restrictions, TDG has since
abandoned hopes of a 51 percent con-
trolling shareholding, due to British
Treasury restrictions and TNT’s own
rapid expansion. And now it has had to
reduce its holding to 15 percent by
placing 2,250,000 shares with Australian
institutions at around $1.72, in August,
1968. Adding salt to these wounds, it
would seem from the evidence of TNT’s
accounts that through rationalisation
and the liquidation of surplus assets,
the Cargo subsidiaries are being made
to pay after all.
Having burned its fingers rather
badly in Australia, TDG is content not
to interfere in TNT management, and
has apparently had nothing to teach
TNT in the economics of transport,
anyway. TDG may look with some
regret at TNT as the one that got away.
Mr. Thomas subscribes more to the
idea apparently held by Slater Walker
that there is more scope for profit
improvement in taking over a company
with inferior management, where the
assets are not being fully used. And
his current interest in R. W. Miller
(Holdings) Ltd., the coal, transport,
and shipping business, may be activated
by such a consideration, although the
avowed motive is to get an inside view
of the shipping business from the Miller
boardroom. Purchase of 880,000 shares
at $1.43, costing $1,276,000 in August,
1968, forced an invitation for two TNT
men to join the Miller board, which
was rejected because of the strings
attached. Last week’s purchase of a
large block of 500,000 shares at 30c
above the market (costing $2.25),
giving TNT an 18 percent interest
against Mr. R. W. Miller’s control of
24 percent, seems destined to create a
power struggle, although TNT said
earlier that the initial parcel was con-
sidered as an investment rather than a
first move to control R. W. Miller
(Holdings).
TNT is also involved in buying the
transport assets of Kwikasair and finan-
cing it by a one-for-eight issue at 75c
premium. (TDG is expected to take up
its reduced entitlement.) Management
will be fully absorbed this year in
employing the Kwikasair assets, starting
up international forwarding and with
proposals to operate a shipping service
from Perth to Darwin and intermediate
ports. TNT will otherwise not be in the
takeover or expansion market for the

next 12 months, according to its chair-
man.
TNT probably cannot maintain its
past rate of growth without continuing
to absorb other businesses. And although
next year will be one of consolidation,
there are still plenty of smaller busi-
nesses to tackle later. There is no doubt
about the ambitions and aggressiveness
of TNT management.
Transport in Australia is as efficient
as in the U.S., for instance, but because
of the scanty distribution of population
across a vast continent, transport is an
expensive component cost of goods.
TNT’s net profit to revenue is only 3c
a dollar, compared with about 10c in
the U.S., where governmental restric-
tions provide some protection for trans-
port operators. But Australia is the
only advanced Western nation with no
governmental control of transport, free-
dom of interstate transport being
guaranteed by the Constitution.
Tremendous scope for growth, how-
ever, exists in TNT’s move into inter-
national forwarding, offering better
margins than its major existing business
of interstate forwarding. TNT expects
it to be highly profitable, with very
little capital outlay. It is concentrating
on the U.K., Europe, Japan, and the
east and west coasts of the U.S. This
international door-to-door service will
be effected through the Customs agency
subsidiary, Rudders International.
Outlining prospects for the future,
the chairman (Mr. K. W. Thomas)
uttered a fine generality in predicting
a continuation of the seven-year trend-
line in the company’s profit graph, and
more particularly a significant increase
in earning rate on expanded capital.
That trend-line has shown a sharp lift
in profits, but the earning rate on
average capital employed has dipped in
the past two years. The shares issued
to TDG were not entitled to dividend
for two interims and a final, that is,
they did not rank for dividend until
December 31, 1967 (although issued in
August, 1966), so they ranked only for
the final payment in 1967-68.
The earning rate on average capital
ranking for dividend then slipped frac-
tionally from 21.6 to 21.0 percent in
the past year, as profit jumped from
$775,742 (excluding pre-acquisition
profits and capital profits) to $1,551,094.
The earning rate, calculated on average
monthly paid capital, improved from
18.8 to 23.3 percent. Issue of a
one-for-two bonus in April, 1968 (which
meant a 50 percent lift in shareholders’
income because dividend was held at
12 percent), confuses the earnings
picture also.
On year end capital, earning rate
improved from 13.1 percent in 1967
to 17.5 percent in 1968, and the com-
pany intimates that it will do better
on year end capital in 1968-69.
Revenue only improved by five percent
from $46.7 million to $49.1 million, so
the much higher 1968 profit reflects
substantial economies in operations.

a member of the
group of companies.
The company is now earning revenue
at the rate of $1 million a week,
handling over 15,000 consignments each
working day. Trading report for the
first quarter of this year to September
30 will be made public about the end
of this month, and it will be a favor-
able one, with news of considerable
profit improvement over the September
quarter of last year.
TNT’s 1968 profit was boosted by tax
losses, allowing provision of only 33
percent against pretax profits, instead
of the new rate of 45 percent. Slightly
less tax relief will be available again
this year. Depreciation and amortisa-
tion provision fell substantially, pre-
sumably because of the disposal of
assets.
TNT has 75 terminals in Australia
and 17 in New Zealand, most of which
have 50 percent surplus capacity, so
capital expenditure for the immediate
future should not be great. It operates
and co-ordinates all forms of trans-
port services, while interstate forward-
ing by rail is a large sector of the
business. It owns and operates a large
fleet of over-the-road trailers, supple-
mented by a strong permanent owner-
driver fleet. Piggy-back services to
Perth and sea-road services to Tas-
mania are also included in group
activities.
Improvement in cash flow was
sufficient to enable the board to re-
pay all debenture borrowings before
1968 balance date, giving directors
freedom to move in the sale of surplus
properties and other assets, hence the
disappearance of $2.9 million in deben-
tures as at June 30, 1967, from the
latest accounts. Among unsecured loans
repayable within 12 months is a final
$200,000 unsecured deposit, part of the
$1 million loan money made available
by TDG as part of the $6 million price
for the sale of the Cargo companies.
In the year just past, TNT sold
off $1,250,000 worth of assets for a
small capital loss, and then had
$750,000 left to dispose of. (It is be-
lieved to have since negotiated a sale
for the largest remaining asset, Rudders’
Melbourne terminal, for $400,000.)
Past growth has been financed by
share issues to take over Scarfs Central
Warehouse in 1962, the refrigerated
transport business of Armstrong in
1964, W. Wood of the Gold Coast, C. C.
Robinson of Rockhampton, and P. E.
Power of Wagga in 1964, the 3,000,000
50c shares issued to Cargo at $1 pre-
mium in December, 1966, and the
1,250,000 shares at premium for
Alltrans in 1967. Cousins Transport was
taken over in November, 1966, for al-
most $J million cash, and Kwikasair
assets recently for around $3 million
cash.
The one-for-eight issue at 75c pre-
mium affords an entry to a growth
stock at about 10c discount on the old
share price of around $1.70, bearing
in mind the smaller brokerage on rights.

The

world of
EASTERN
really is
Something
Else!”
Peter Boxall
Eastern's Regional Manager
When one does a lot of flying, it’s easy
to become blase about such things as
“coffee, tea or milk” and “would you
care for a pillow”.
That's why I was so refreshed on a recent
Eastern flight from New York to Miami,
Eastern’s "Something Else” route.
There’s “Something Else”, something
different, something better for economy
class and first class. If a steak dinner
doesn’t appeal there's "Something Else"
—if you don’t yearn for your usual
cocktail there’s “Something Else". That,
by the way, is the name of a new Eastern
cocktail. Even on Eastern’s snack flights
there's "Something Else".
First class? That’s “Something Else”
again. There’s the lonosphere Lounge
at both New York and Miami where
you can catch up on dictation, order
cocktails, watch television or just relax.
First class-ers are offered chilled Sangria
as soon as they board - - - just that
“Something Else” Eastern style.
The menu, of course, is “Something
Else” again - - - with gourmet foods,
Filet, Mignon, Tournedos, Brook Trout or
Chicken Cordon Bleu with fine wines,
and with dessert “Something Else”
Champagne.
Eastern’s new concept of service between
New York and Miami really is “Something
Else”.

JASCO HAS CRACKED
THE TOUGH
EDUCATION MARKET
THERE ARE A NUMBER of listed
companies which have a small capital
but are big in profits and future pros-
pects. Buying their shares can be a bit
difficult when there aren’t many share-
holders, but the rewards are well worth
the trouble, particularly when the com-
pany has Jasco Holdings Limited’s
attribute of being unique in Australia.
Jasco has been in existence since 1960
(as Jasco Pty. Ltd.), but went public
only in 1965. Between 1960 and 1965,
the Sydney-based distributor of drawing
materials, scholastic supplies, and com-
mercial office equipment boosted net
profit from $7464 to $49,944, and
increased the dividend rate each year
from 8 percent up to 27 percent. Since
1965 net profit has doubled to $99,000,
with earnings per 50 cent share moving
from 11.7 cents to 14.7 cents, despite a
one-for-five bonus issue in April, 1968.
However, the dividend has been held
at a steady 12 percent since 1967, as
Jasco prefers to finance expansion from
internal sources and at present has no
borrowed funds.
Origins of the company, and its name,
stem from four former employees of
William Lewis Pty. Ltd., manufac-
turers’ agents. In 1959, A. W. Jones,
R. T. Jones, F. D. Austin (now retired),
and R. G. Stuart left William Lewis,
taking a total of over 100 years’ ex-
perience, and a lot of ideas, to form
Jasco, which gets its name from the
initial letters of Jones, Austin, and
Stuart. The first year was pretty tough,
and R. G. Stuart, the managing direc-
tor, found a near basic wage quite a
change after a good executive salary.
Today, at 48, Stuart talks about the
period with a sense of achievement,
although he gives full credit to his
partners. A. W. Jones is now assistant
managing director in Sydney, R. T.
Jones is manager of the Victorian
branch, whilst after the formation of a
Brisbane branch in 1964 J. R. Cooper
was appointed manager and sub-
sequently a director of the company.
J. F. Bowne joined the board in 1966
as chairman.
The company has built up 45 sole
Australian agencies in specialised
educational equipment, drawing
materials, and sundry commercial office
products. Experience, good agency
spread, and an energetic approach,
which takes executives overseas each
year pursuing new products, has set
Jasco on the right way to growth. New
sales promotion techniques to crack the
tough education market have paid off
well, particularly in slide rules. Six and
a half years ago the Aristo slide rule
was virtually unknown in Australia,
even to Jasco’s executives, but it is now
the country’s largest seller through a
combination of increased education
expenditure and a concerted market
drive by Jasco, in conjunction with
their West German principals, Dennert
and Pape.
Operations have been reorganised
recently into four sections: scholastic
and commercial, drawing office sup-
plies, fancy (serviettes, photo and stamp
albums, etc.), and business aids, which
include the products of Business Aids
Pty. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary.
The company believes this will enable
salesmen to give detailed attention to
the wide product range, although the
scholastic products also overlap draw-
ing office supplies. I understand that
on a breakdown of group profit about
30 percent each comes from drawing
supplies and scholastic materials, 20
percent from commercial, while fancy
goods and business aids each provide 10
percent. Branches are maintained in
Melbourne and Brisbane, with Adelaide
and Perth sales handled by agents.
In drafting equipment, Jasco’s major
products are Nestler (Germany) track-
type drafting machines, Riepe Werke
(Germany) Rotring Rapidographs, and
Linex (Denmark) drawing materials,
including set-squares, special rulers, and
a vast range of templates. The Nestler
track-type drafting machine, introduced
to Australia by Jasco, has now super-
seded the old parallelogram-type
machine. Track-type machines have a
single arm which moves horizontally
across the drawing-board face, giving
speedier and more accurate drawing
than the two-piece swivel-arm parallelo-
gram machines, and economies of floor
space. Sales of track-type machines, pre-
viously used only in the automotive
industry, have taken off in Australia
and include most commercial and indus-
trial applications and installation in
numerous technical colleges.
Rotring Rapidographs have 85 to 95
percent of the market for drawing pens
and are now used universally in draw-
ing offices. The pen is a complete unit,
has a tubular point providing indian
ink for drawing, and speeds up the
whole drawing process by reducing it

to a single operation. Jasco rates the
Rapidograph its top line, and places
high value on the connection with
Riepe Werke, a major German indus-
trialist. Last year Riepe Werke increased
sales by 40 percent in the face of Ger-
many’s minor recession.
Scholastic materials cover numerous
instruments for use in mathematics and
science, as well as drawing materials.
Principal suppliers are German houses,
which have a first-class reputation for
quality in this field. Most commercial
equipment, including some stationery,
is obtained from Celco Holdings Ltd.,
an Australian manufacturer of letter
clips, foldback clips, paperbinders,
drawing-pins, staples, and staplers.
Celco is the sole Australian manufac-
turer of stapling machines, and the
product has now been exported to the
United States, United Kingdom, and
13 other countries. Jasco holds an
important manufacturing and distribu-
tion licence for Swan Othello ballpoint
pens, which rank third in the company’s
top lines after Rapidographs and draft-
ing machines.
Strong growth is being experienced in
the business-aids section, supplying
powered and hand-operated guillotines,
folding and binding machines, and
paper shredders in four models. With
the exception of paper shredders, all
products are geared to internal offset
printing rooms, which are coming to
many medium and large organisations.
A company whose advertising and print-
ing bill is above $lO,OOO per annum
finds economies in doing its own offset
printing, and Jasco is achieving rapid
market penetration. Paper shredders are
coming into vogue as Australians realise
the importance of security to combat
industrial espionage. Jasco’s range of
shredders cut down to one millimetre
and the company expects growing sales
in line with overseas trends.
Future developments are centred
on the computerisation of drafting
equipment, which is expected to revo-
lutionise this section of industry in the
next five to ten years. Jasco’s Canadian
and U.S. associates have already done
work in this field, and the company
intends sending its technical people to
North America for training. The com-
pany is also expanding relationships
with Japanese manufacturers and good
prospects are forecast in agencies from
Japan.

A NEW PUBLISHER
SETS SAIL ON
A FAIR WIND
By NANCY KEESING
The Red Boat. Gwen Kelly. Alpha
Books. $1.05.
There Was a Man of Our Town. Keith
Thomas. Alpha Books. $1.25.
ALPHA BOOKS is a new paperback
series whose laudable aim is to present
worthwhile Australian fiction at reason-
able prices. A limited number of case-
bound copies of each title is also avail-
able. In appearance the books are
attractively designed (covers for these
two by Harry Williamson) and clearly
printed.
Although in outline the plot of “The
Red Boat” may sound novelettish it is,
in fact, an oddly satisfying novel;
poignant, balanced, and believable. Its
setting is Canada seen through the eyes
of Joan, the Australian wife of an
Australian university lecturer working
in the Dominion.
Joan is shy, gawky, frigid, and lack-
ing in charm and social grace, though
not in quiet prettiness. After fourteen
years of childless union her ineptitudes
have frayed Andrew’s patience and he
is at the point of claiming the
exuberant embraces of a very attractive
French-Canadian widow. Through a
series of flashbacks to her Australian
childhood and youth we come to know
far more of the tragic reasons for
Joan’s ice-block reserve than Andrew
has ever discovered. We have far more
preparation for Joan’s unexpected love
affair, her gradual return to life and
to an acceptance of life, than Andrew
has.
The book concludes in a way that
at first surprises, then convinces, but,
too, its main characters refuse to remain
within its covers I find myself
thinking of them still. Gwen Kelly
writes with perception and composes
with skill. Her style is un-mannered
and exactly observed.
Keith Thomas’ novel is very differ-
ent and in some ways less successful
than “The Red Boat,” partly because
it shows signs of hasty completion. The
opening chapters are fairly detailed, the
end fairly slapdash with several prom-
ising characters virtually lost by the
wayside.
“The man” of the title is Eric
Flower, a young solicitor who has re-
turned to Sydney from Europe seeking
work and for relief from his beautiful,
pregnant, serious-minded German wife.
Work he finds with O’Carroll, a Labor
politician, solicitor, and actual operator
behind building and finance companies
in the mushrooming western-suburban
sprawl.
Flower, who is clever, energetic,
cynical, and entirely self-interested, also
has publishing ambitions which lead
him into one of the student, cultural
fringes of the city. O’Carroll, as
Flower soon discovers, is in every sort
of trouble ranging from a director who
has embezzled funds to a 'beautiful
(but I thought insufferable) actress
daughter who arouses her tipsy father
to a mildly incestuous display.
“Our town” of this book is very
much a man’s world even if, like
Alf, you are a demanding, pretentious,
and not very likable cripple, the girls
will flock and, bless ’em, they’ll be
awfully nice about being saddled with
babies, abortions, deportation
drunks, impotent husbands, and
washing-up after parties.
The novel is amusing in its cynical
way and unco'mfortable, too, because it
is not satire but fairly straight report-
ing, as you will agree if you have lived
long enough in Sydney to recognise
its types. You may even despair if
you don’t take a pull and remember
that a large city can offer other worlds.
Indeed, if you opted out of the stu-
dent fringe some years ago you might
be surprised to notice how little has
changed people have more money
to spend on interminable cafe “club”
meals, but otherwise even the dialogue
seems unaltered.
The
Red Boat
OFF TO A FRESH START
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Salvage. Jacky Gilliott. Gollancz. $3.90.
THE FIRST-PAGE montage is a bit
startling, but it proves to be a fair indi-
cation of the contents, not a stunt: two
quotes nestle side by side, one from
Sigmund Freud and one from some-
one called Mary Grant writing in
something called “Woman’s Own.”
However, it seems significant that by
the final page Mary Grant is heard no
more and Freud has the last word.
Jacky Gilliott’s promising first novel
is one version of “Woman’s Life and
Love,” vintage 1968. It probes a very
real and topical problem which has
always existed in one way or another,
but which is going to get worse before,
if ever, it gets better, especially now
that tertiary education has become
almost common and more and more
women are discovering that they not
only have a brain but that they also
enjoy using it. What do they do with
it when they marry, have children, and
get bogged down in routine domestic
drudgery? Some succeed in taking
their intellectual pleasure vicariously;
some, like the central character of
“Salvage,” let it go to seed beyond the
point of no return and subconsciously
take out their frustrations on their
unsuspecting families.
Helena Pascall thinks as much with
her ovaries (pace Simone de Beauvoir)
as with her intellect. This does not
make the problem easier; it makes it
worse. She is continually torn in two
by a desire to have children and a
desire to rush off and leave the lot. The
result is a kind of madness that seems
to come close to schizophrenia. As
Freud says, “The great question that
has never been answered and which I
have not yet been able to answer despite
my 30 years of research into the fem-
inine soul, is, what does a woman
want?” As the novel opens, Jacky
Gilliott’s woman has just abandoned
her family to try to find out. She has
rushed off on an impulse. There has
been no quarrel, no dramatic warning.
She has been wiping small faces with
grey flannels and making scotch pan-
cakes. Without even a note, she
abandons her loving husband and three
young children and hitchhikes a lift
to anywhere or nowhere.
She was once a bit of a tramp. The
salesman who picks her up and wines,
dines, and takes her to a hotel room
notices it at once. So do the boys at
her husband’s school, who have paid
due tribute with some ornamental
graffiti. Before her marriage to good,
staid, mundane, and unimaginative
teacher James, Helena had lived
through a violent passion with the now-
famous author Pope. (Incidentally, a
most unsuitable name for this particu-
larly hippie character, whichever way
you look at it.)
However, Helena had also carved out
a successful career for herself in
journalism, and had been given an
important commission to write a book.
At first, she cheerfully renounces it all.
The trouble comes to a head when,
after the birth of her children, she
tries to start again. Out of touch, out of
practice, and out of the minds of the
editors, she reaps nothing but a harvest
of rejection slips. Turning for help to
her former boss, an older journalist she
had always admired, she flees in horror
at the discovery that she is a lesbian.
(A very fashionable subject just now


of which this reviewer is getting heartily
sick.)
Then James invites Pope to stay and
succeeds all too well in exorcising the
ghost that had been serving a useful
function in Helena’s wish-dream-life.
It is now the two men who prove to
have everything in common intellectu-
ally. Their minds meet on the same
plane. It is Helena who is the odd
woman out. She does the washing-up.
The story is told in a series of over-
lapping disconnected flashbacks while
Helena is on the run. They are domin-
ated by her former Bloomsbury career,
a monster mother-figure, and by Pope.
Toward the end there is a very effective
fantasy sequence, a deliberate hoax on
the reader, in which Helena’s son, with
whom she has a kind of love-hate rela-
tionship, a platonic miniature of her
old relationship with Pope, has a serious
accident. Helena has already changed
her mind, left the hotel, and is return-
ing home when the hallucination occurs.
There is a false happy ending, but it
has a hollow ring. Nothing has
been solved. She is simply back where
she began, waiting for the syndrome to
start again.
Jacky Gilliott writes sincerely and
candidly; there is nothing prefabri-
cated in her vision; she obviously knows
what she is talking about. But,
altogether, “Salvage” seems just not
quite individual enough in style to make
a lasting mark of its own, from the
literary point of view, among the
bumper crop of recent more contem-
porary works. There are a few pointers
that her next novel might be different.

THERE HAS recently been speculation
as to the harmful inbreeding that may
flow from close friendships among
poets and writers generally. While these
may result in mutual admiration soci-
eties, it seems to me that the results of
such friendships are almost wholly good.
Bad poets will be bad whether they
band together in cartels or whether
they go it alone. Potentially good
writers can only gain from close associ-
ation with a few peers. The list of
examples is endless, Goethe and Schil-
ler, Pound and Eliot, Wordsworth and
Coleridge . . .
A writer to write well must be con-
vinced of the importance of what he is
writing. Where his own conviction
fails, he will not convince the reader for
very long. For this reason writers gravi-
tate together, seeking an audience of
friends who will give informed praise
and criticism. It is a mistake to think
that this results only in cosy back-
slapping. Pound, when he first read
Eliot’s “Waste Land,” did not just sit
back and clap, he chopped out a third
of it.
Complaints have recently been raised
at the over-sensitiveness of Australian
writers to criticism and, in particular,
some remarks by Judith Wright in
which she said that the writer must be
wary of critics and listen to the voice
inside him rather than multiplicity of
voices outside. The people criticising
Judith Wright’s remarks have, I feel,
mistaken the point of what she said.
No writer in his right senses would
wish to establish an anti-critical estab-
lishment where all criticism and critics
were suppressed by a stream of vitu-
peration from practising writers.
Her statement is addressed to writers,
not readers. A writer should be wary of
listening to too many critics. An over-
exposure to literary talk and fads can
result in a writer losing his sense of
his own uniqueness, which is fatal.
It is not an accident that Bruce
Beaver and Craig Powell have brought
out their two books simultaneously with
the same publisher. In each of their
volumes a number of the poems are
dedicated to each other and obviously
they work closely together. In fact the
poets are very different in temperament.
While Bruce Beaver is dense, irregular,
and uses a rich and sometimes idiosyn-
cratic vocabulary, the style of Craig
Powell is more open, regular, and direct.
Beaver is also a dozen years older than
Powell.
Beaver’s poetry is rich and elliptical.
In his poems about Sydney Harbor,
Canberra, and Auckland he writes
poetry akin to Robert Lowell’s “The
Union Dead” without being derivative.
These are poems which yield up their
meaning and fragrance rather like leaves
when they are crushed. They are not
poems which can be read superficially.
The reader must keep his wits about
him when reading them and put effort
into the poems. They grow with
familiarity.
Beaver adopts a warts-and-all
approach to himself as in these lines:
And of course myself, as usual
Trying to fit self in completely;
The integer as unattainable
As a War Veteran’s Art Union Prize.
A quotation from “The Killers” shows
him at his best: '
Past burrows and bare patches pellet-
mounded
Down the steep hill side white-washed
by the moon’s
Long let of milk light, back to the
dark paddocks’
Stubble and loam-crumble under
boot;
The small pelts as we pass, those
meagre trophies
Of Man the Hunter in desuetude . . .
The darkling farm dogs passing us in
silence . . .
Bruce Beaver is often savage, but his
savagery never overcomes his basic good
humor and the vitality of his language.
Many of Craig Powell’s poems are
sonnets or in strict forms. In general,
he has a good command of his medium.
His subject matter is more autobio-
graphical than Bruce Beaver’s. There
are poems about broken love affairs,
and on the death of his son, and arising
from his work as a doctor. “Madonna
and Child” is particularly poignant.
An image of silence: fine dust falling
on hair
where two of them sit motionless. The
light
glides with a rhythmic stillness out
of sight
yet leaves a kind of radiance upon
mother and child asleep in a warm
chair,
rags stuffed under the door, the gas
turned on.
Among other good poems in this
book, “Through Darkened Suburbs” is
a very fine poem. Not all the poems
come off. Where Powell adopts a warts-
and-all approach to himself it does not
always work with me; for instance where
he describes himself as “a blathering
bard.” “How They Did It,” which is
a poem about making love in a bath,
begins well but the final lines strike
me as being a bit fiat. On the whole,
however, this is a good second volume.
Dorothy Hewett, a modern ro'mantic
with a social conscience, has composed
a number of carefully written ballads
about the outback, with overtones of
Edith Sitwell. “Country Idyll” is an
example. It is an enjoyable poem, but
is just a trifle lush and literary. Simi-
larly, “Bagman’s Ballad,” which is half-
serious and half-parody with echoes of
Shaw Neilson’s “Sundowner,” Wright’s
“Bullocky,” Henry Lawson, and others,
just fails because it is over-literary, as
in the last verse:
and the immortal swagman goes,
Singing down the centuries,
He hangs on a sheepskin on the fence,
A shadow on the bluegum trees.
The ballad is a particularly demand-
ing form, requiring the precision of,
say, John Manifold. Without absolute
precision a ballad rarely succeeds.
Dorothy Hewett is, I feel, better in
larger and more rambling structures,
poems such as “Legend of the Green
Country” or “The Hidden Journey,”
which is a poem about changing mental
attitudes in Soviet Russia and has a
number of sharply observed passages.
Dorothy Hewett is best where she has
strong subject matter in which she is
herself deeply involved personally, as
in these two long poems. She can write
with passion and rich sensuousness.
Richard Flantz’s poems are either
very tight or very loose. On the whole
I prefer the tight poems, although the
most memorable one for me in this
book is “Moon Over Herbertstrausse,”
which is very free floating. Flantz is not
afraid to experiment, and the best
poems in this book have a sense of
spontaneity and flow. Sometimes as in
“Winter Waters,” which uses a welter
of words beginning with “w,” the
experiment does not work for me.

Just the way it crouches low to the ground imparts the sensation of full flight! The new Dodge Phoenix
is a car with enormous power; under control but ready for release when you say so. Even the most
hardened sceptics are amazed by its agility and instant response. That’s easily understandable, too,
when you consider the size of the V 8 engines: a 318 cu. in. 230 b.h.p. or a 383 cu. in. 270 b.h.p. But
power alone is not enough. The Dodge Phoenix is also the ultimate in luxury, softness and silence.

BRITISH SF'S ANAEMIA
By JOHN BAXTER
The Judgment of Eve. Edgar Pang-
born. $330.
Rork! Avram Davidson. $2.25.
All Judgment Fled. James White. $2.65.
The Dolphin Rider. Roy Meyers. $3.30.
All Rapp and Whiting.
NINETY PERCENT of all science
fiction is rubbish, Theodore Sturgeon
once remarked, but the truth of this
observation, not to mention its rider
that 90 percent of everything is rub-
bish, anyway did not make it
easier for me to accept that, out of ten
new science fiction titles, only three
were worth reading to the end, let alone
writing about. Significantly, two of the
three are American. British science
fiction is, one realises, a chronically par-
lous field, drained of new blood by the
lucrative American market, but until
this week I had no idea how advanced
the anaemia had become.
The enterprising firm of Rapp and
Whiting, relatively new to the sf field,
has made a courageous attempt to
instil some vigor into their list, but
almost without exception their choice
of new authors is unfortunate. There is
no point in mocking a book that
exhibits no indication that its writer
will ever amount to anything, but may
I, as a practising sf writer, make an
appeal for an end to publications like
“The Dolphin Rider,” surely the worst
novel ever offered for public sale. A
thin adaptation to use the most
charitable word of “Tarzan of the
Apes,” with dolphins instead of gorillas,
it sends sf back to the days of the
pulps, or beyond. No service is done to
the publisher, the sf field, or to the
writer by the issue of books like this.
Slightly more enthusiasm is possible
about “All Judgment Fled,” although
it is hardly in the crisp style which
James White exhibited in “Tourist
Planet” or the recent intriguing “The
Watch Below.” The initial premise of
an alien spaceship found drifting on
the edge of the solar system, its crew
implacably hostile and homicidal
toward mankind, was old when Murray
Leinster wrote it in the ’thirties, and
White makes few improvements on it.
I take his point that communicating
witlv aliens will be hard, and that mis-
conceptions could and probably will
occur but it seems unfair to load the
dice by making the Earth representa-
tives a group of hung-up psychos with
enough emotional problems to keep any
analyst busy for a year. A little more
subtlety in characterisation might have
made “All Judgment Fled” a powerful
successor to White’s earlier novels.
Memories of previous triumphs also
veil one’s examination of Pangborn’s
“The Judgment of Eve,” inasmuch as
his earlier “A Mirror for Observers”
set new standards in literacy and polish
for science fiction. In “Davy,” Pang-
born explored a future world where
atomic war had cleared the way for a
return to swashbuckling, fantasy, and
individual exploration. Set nearer to
our time than “Davy,” “The Judgment
of Eve” deals nevertheless with a simi-
lar world, where the remnants of man-
kind creep among the ruins, searching
for some new basis for life. Like
Aldiss’ “Greybeard,” the interest of the
nook lies in men adjusting to ruin and
decay, then casting them off in favor of
a new life. Incantory, mythopoetic,
written in Pangborn’s usual tight and
athletic style, the book, nevertheless,
lacks Aldiss’ special integrity which
made “Greybeard” a classic.
After the half-successes and down-
right failures of these books, it was a
pleasure to strike “Rork!”, a novel I
had enjoyed last year on its U.S.
publication and was able to redis-
cover with enthusiasm in this edition.
Avram Davidson’s short stories are
one of the great delights of American
sf, and his tenure as editor of the
prestigious “Magazine of Fantasy and
Sf” did much to drag it out into the
light again. His novels seldom live up
to the energetic short material, mainly
because Davidson’s skill is primarily
with dialogue, dialect, and thumbnail
characterisation. Earlier novels like
“Masters of the Maze,” which
depended on these qualities, descended
into melees of cross-talk like a Martian
minstrel show, but in “Rork!” the
technique is combined with a clear plot
and believable characters, both of
which restrain the language.
Even a mention of the plot would
betray its slim surprise, but one could
mention a backwater planet inhabited
by a race of declined Earth settlers
called “Tocks,” a plant called “Red-
wing” whose leaves are a vital
ingredient of Earth medicines, and an
alien fauna dominated by the sinister
Rorks. Something between a spider and
an elephant, the Rorks are one of
Davidson’s better creations, and he
uses them cleverly in unravelling his
story. What I find so splendid about
“Rork!” is its sheer story-telling
capability; you can’t help but get in-
volved. Ran Lomar, the “hero,” is
either dense, in a rut, or both, for most
of the story, but he still gets things
done, and in the best tradition of sf
heroes rallies in the middle chapters
with some admirable but believably
logical acts. Of his women, one need
only say that it is nice to find some
realistic sexual encounters in sf for a
change.
The book’s special delight, however,
is its language. Slangy, quick, it re-
. mains from chapter to chapter a
delight to read. I liked the beginning
very much. “Rango, the Tame Tock,
sweated earnestly at his work in the
little valley between Blicky-Got-Caught
and Last Ridge. It was farther south
than Rango cared to work . . . but it
was all aflame with Redwing . . .”
Or Ran trying to get the recalcitrant
Tocks to be more efficient in their
harvest. “They did not see. This is
the way things were done. Things were
done this way. Things weren’t done
another way. You did things the way
you did things. You didn’t do things
the way you didn’t do things. Thus, the
Tocks . . .” And thus Avram Davidson.
I hope his book sells as well as it
deserves.
LOVE SONG
On a misty morning, the trees
Have sudden angles, like fingers
Gnarled with all the cares of being,
From old Chinese paintings.
But, walking home, my heart
Holds the bright image of your body,
The boat of our love rocked gently
On the pulse of an unknown sea.

THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
When the sounds of music have to stop
By DENIS O'BRIEN
SO, HERE, in person, was the man
responsible for the world’s most recent
cinemaniacal cult: Robert Wise, the
director of “The Sound of Music” -—-
a movie seen by so many people so
many times that its soundtrack might
easily become the most universally well-
known recitation piece since “Little
Miss Muffett.” From its $lO7 million
gross takings to its influence on the
man in London who so mourned the
end of its three and a half year run
that he bought and carried away the
cinema seat he’d used twice a week
for 161 weeks, “SOM” has accumulated
a staggering variety of human res-
ponses. Sentimentality has never had
such a victory over cynicism, and Mr.
Wise might yet be named as Holly-
wood’s Santa Claus of the century. It
would not be accurate casting. Robert
Wise is not the schmaltz merchant this
one film among his dozens has popu-
larly made him seem, nor does he pre-
tend that the sticky-icky quality of
“SOM” was entirely his kind of music.
“When we started location work in
Salzburg I realised that there were
parts of the film that could easily
become just too improbably sentimen-
tal,” he said in Sydney last week. “I
did everything I could to diminish this
tendency without destroying the heart
of the story. Even so I was still worried
that it all seemed so darned artificial.
As it turned out it was a grand movie
great to make and big at the box
office. But I just don’t understand how
anyone could sit through it a hundred
times or more.”
Mr. Wise is visiting Australia to lend
an influential hand to the promotion of
“Star!” his latest big-budget product
and a sort of tandem sister to “Sound
of Music” inasmuch as it is a senti-
mentally abridged biography of Ger-
trude Lawrence, and stars Julie
Andrews. But there the tearshed ends,
at least for a while. “I do not want to
be typecast as a director of musicals—-
sentimental or otherwise. I’m now very
keen to make a film of contemporary
character.”
Robert Wise is not a motion-picture
industry stereotype; he dresses with
quietly expensive neutrality, keeps
hyperbole under rein and has a repu-
tation for undemonstrative force when
making films. “I’m not a stamper, or
a yeller, or a temper-loser; I’ve just
never been able to work that way. As
a director I am always very much in
control and I believe in letting it be
known at the beginning of every picture
that I am in charge.”
At 54, Wise is now in his 26th year
Robert Wise...one dose of schmaltz
in films. He began as assistant cutter
in the old RKO studios, winning his
first screen credit when he helped sal-
vage a ten-minute short on the South
Seas from thousands of feet of film
for an abandoned feature. In days of
mindless Hollywood extravagance any
selfless effort to save money was notable
and Wise was promoted to more impor-
tant editing assignments. He worked
with Orson Welles on “Citizen Kane”
and then on Welles’ “The Magnificent
Ambersons,” directing several scenes
when Welles had to visit South America
in mid-filming.
His first credit as a director was in
1943 when he replaced the late Val
Lewton on a psychological horror film
called “The Curse of the Cat People.”
It was brought in for a budget of
$lOO,OOO and grossed $1 million an
accomplishment Wise cannot entirely
pocket because Lewton had already set
a literate and mature pattern in the
genre and at that time in the 1940 s
there was a vogue for horror films. But
it was enough to establish Wise as a
director and to put his hand to the
Hollywood conveyor belt.
“In those days we seemed to be
working in a sort of vacuum,” he says.
“Low budgets, one picture after
another. It was difficult to get a per-
spective. Soon after I married, I said
to my wife that I wasn’t going to be
satisfied just doing B budget films. If
it came to the point, I was determined
to be a top editor rather than a routine
director.”
He did not have to make the choice.
Dore Schary, the RKO studio chief,
was attracted to his developing exper-
tise and he graduated to A budget films.
But it was not until 1948, when he
directed “The Set Up,” a picture which
exposed the seaminess of prize-fighting,
that his work began attracting signifi-
cant interest.
Twenty years later he sits in a suite
on the 17th floor of Sydney’s Went-
worth Hotel and plays the instant recall
game with a selection of his films
so'me good, some bad, some happy, and
some traumatic:
“The Day the Earth Stood Still”
“That’s a long time ago, but my lasting
memory of it is of trying to project to
the world a film about the threat of
nuclear warfare.”
“The Desert Rats” “We did loca-
tion work in desert areas around Cali-
fornia and now I think of it I can still
feel the discomfort. And I remember
thinking what hell it must have been
for the troops in the North African
desert.
“Executive Suite” “My real fears
about working with such a high-
powered cast for the first time and my
delight in discovering that, as true pro-
fessionals, they were no trouble to work
with. I probably had less trouble with
that cast than any I’ve ever worked
with.”
“Helen of Troy” “Terrible prob-
lems . . . Rome . . . difficult adminis-
tration . . . not a happy memory”
“Tribute to a Bad Man” “My
instant memory of that revolves around
the trouble we had with Spencer Tracy.
A great actor, but he gave us problems
with that picture and we had to remove
him from the cast. He took it badly.”
“Somebody Up There Likes Me”
“Happy days in New York, mooching
around the city with Paul Newman and
Rocky Graziano, visiting Graziano’s
haunts, getting the feel of Graziano’s
city for a picture about him.”
“This Could Be The Night” “My
first venture into comedy, per se.
Greatly enjoyable, but it didn’t take
off at the box office. A sense of dis-
appointment.”
“I Want To Live” “A totally
emotional experience. After the gas-
chamber scenes we all felt utterly
drained.”
“Odds Against Tomorrow” “A
favorite picture of mine. I paired Harry
Belafonte and Robert Ryan in a story
about a bank robbery and I still think
it should have done better than it
did.”
“West Side Story” “The most dif-
ficult film on which I’ve ever worked,
partly because I had to work with a
co-director (Jerome Robbins) and


partly because of the awesome chal-
lenge it represented. Fascinating, suc-
cessful but difficult.”
And now, “Star!” “It is a very
recent memory, but I still marvel at
the job Julie has done. She surprised
us all every day with a demonstration
of some new skill. Most impressive.”
Robert Wise is palpably enthusiastic
about filming. “It is going through a
very exciting and very stimulating
period. I don’t pretend to understand
everything some of the young people
are doing sometimes their techniques
seem to me to be retrogressive but
I do have lively contact and com-
munication with them. I lecture at
some of the colleges back home, and it
is good to feel their real interest in my
work. When you’re in the middle of a
youthquake it is strangely satisfying
not to feel passe.”
THEATRE/PHILLIP ADAMS
AFRICAN MAGIC
Wait a Minim. Comedy Theatre, Mel-
bourne.
FOREVER cutting off its white nose
to spite its black face, South Africa has
long banned the telly. It seems the
Baas must deny himself the inspiration
of the White Tornado for fear
“Bonanza” might give the Bantu ideas.
But on the evidence provided by
Sarah Atkinson
and friends in
“Wait a Minim”
“Wait a Minim” there are compensa-
tions. For Maggie’s Frank Lazarus
attributes the excellence of South
African theatre at least as far as
performance is concerned directly *to
the absence of television. Certainly if
South Africa has many more at home
as irresistibly alive as this musical revue,
being setless would be no great hard-
ship.
The show' began its life in Johannes-
burg in 1962, when, following an acci-
dent to the star of the straight play he
was producing, Leon Gluckman had to
organise a replacement show at short
notice. He contacted Andrew and Paul
Tracey, the young sons of a world
authority on African music, w'ho
brought with them an improbable col-
lection of exotic musical instruments,
and together they began to improvise a
musical satire. They were subsequently
joined by one Kendrew Lascelles, who
combines a Tati physique with Milli-
gan madness, a song-writer, Jeremy
Taylor, and a young French singer,
Michel Martel. Three pretty girls later
they were a success, and after touring
South Africa and Rhodesia have sub-
sequently played in London, New York,
Canada, and New Zealand.
In contrast to most of Williamson’s
musical junkets, “Wait a Minim” em-
ploys no chi-chi sets. For the most
part, the stage is bare except for a
few cane blinds and colored panels
that slide and yo-yo for dramatic
effect. The format is fairly casual, with
musical numbers punctuated by brief
dialogues and sight gags.
Musically, “Minim” is overwhelming.
The cast play upward of 30 very
different instruments, including a
Umakhweyana bow, a Japanese
shakuhachi, African hand pianos,
Indian drones, bagpipes, and sousa-
phones. The commentary on South
African baastardry is generally terse
and effective, and the comedy, which is
largely visual, works like magic.
Particularly impressive is the way the
cast get double value from any given
segment, as when April Orlich (a
girl as beautiful as Benin ivory) dances
alone to an Irish song played on the
flute.
For a few minutes the audience is
hypnotised by the purity of what they
see and hear, but the act ends with
an abruptly blowm raspberry. Yet some-
how the joke doesn’t devalue the
beauty of what has gone before,
Similarly, a German folk sequence is
momentarily interrupted as the guitars
turn into machine-guns. But an
apparently funny sketch is just as
likely to turn serious without warn-
ing.
The company dance in gu'mboots
festooned with seashells that make a
noise like the Australian lagerphone,
and the theatre echoes to the sound
of huge wooden xylophones and gourds,
Then, with a jiggle of the bamboo
curtains, they transform themselves into
giant medieval knights for comic joust-
ing. The panels slide, and they’ve
swopped armor for kilts, cabers, and
sexual innuendo. All in all, the cast
of eight handle 51 songs, sketches,
dances, and routines.
Often after a long run, particularly
of a physically demanding musical or
revue, a company will show the strain
in glassy eyes and brassy smiles, but
the “Minim” crew are completely
fresh and after six years still give the
illusion of spontaneity.
FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVERY
IMPOSSIBLE DREAM
Up the Junction. Director, Peter Col-
li nson.
HERE IT IS AGAIN the senti-
mental fairytale which thinks that by
using sordid backgrounds and rude
words it will suddenly become realistic
and significant. Not a hope, I’m afraid:
it remains a novelettish daydrea'm,
especially in nice clean color photog-
raphy that makes squalor look posi-
tively charming.
Based on a novel by Nell Dunn
(autobiographical, we’re led to believe),
it's about the daughter of a well-to-do
London family, who decides that having
money is disgraceful and the only “real
life is to be found among the lower-
income groups. So she gets a job in a
factory and takes a miserable walk-up
flat in Battersea, which is apparently
the place of her dreams; tries consci-
entiously to lose her upper-class accent,
wears awful earrings, and finds a
Battersea-born boyfriend.
Things don’t turn out quite as she
would like seeing people fighting
drunk, killed on the road, or suffering
the agonies of a clumsy abortion (per-
formed by an impossibly Hogarthian
old hag) is horrifying rather than
stimulating. Also the silly girl is
astounded w r hen she discovers she isn’t
really accepted, only tolerated every-
one has made allowances for her
“poshness,” and indeed her money and
class are the basis of her attraction for
her lover.
Suzy Kendall, a pleasing young act-
ress, who may do better things,
struggles valiantly with a role that is
fundamentally unbelievable (she’s
afflicted with lines like, “Money des-
troys people. It makes them false and
dishonest.” Even if you thought so,
you’d hardly say so to people who
hadn’t any). Even as a fantasy figure,
the character is not appealing in her
selfish desire to be one of the “real
people” she ignores everyone else’s
feelings, and insists on eating at “caffs”
or whelk stalls, when her boyfriend longs
for the glamor of a restaurant dinner.
But there can be nothing but praise
for Dennis Waterman, as her lover,
vital and credible even when the script
uses him as a mouthpiece rather than
a hu'man being. The others in the cast
are rather frighteningly vigorous and
noisy, going through their well-
choreographed routine to prove that
they are characters, working class, and
the backbone of the nation.

THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
SONS OF VIRGINIA
The Boys in the Band. Mart Crowley.
Playbox Theatre, Sydney.
THEY SAY “Virginia Woolf” was
really written for four men: six years
later the sons of Virginia Woolf turn
out to be the Boys in the Band. Unfor-
tunately, Mart Crowley has not been
content with a straightforward camp
restatement of Albee’s success bitchy,
biting dialogue and psychological party
games leading to “moments of truth”—
but has seen fit to play social worker
as well.
He carefully explains how it all
happens (Michael and Donald open the
play with a duologue which spells out
some psychiatric textbook details about
dominant mothers); how it affects other
aspects of life (Michael, for example, is
Roman Catholic, Harold is Jewish);
and who is affected (care is taken to
present a representative cross-section
ranging from “straight” Alan, through
hustler Cowboy, to Emory, who has
“known what he was since he was four.”
The core of truth that the author plants
at the end of the games is that, deep-
down, homosexuals hate themselves.
This extremely selfconscious, but
hardly revolutionary, intellectual con-
tent is fortunately eclipsed by the
hearty commercial exploitation of the
“Virginia Woolf” party format and the
associated dialogue: the Bette Davis
movie jokes come rather more natur-
ally from Michael than they did from
Martha.
The performances are all good, but
it is impossible not to be especially
impressed by John Krummel, who
supports the whole thing (as Michael),
and by Charles Little (as Emory)
these are probably the most impres-
sive parts, and both actors make the
most of them. John Tasker’s production
is clear and precise—the first act (apart
from the expository duologue at the
beginning) is full of interesting changes
of mood and tempo. Only the fight and
entrance of Harold at the end of the
act seemed insecure and somehow
muffled. The second act doesn’t really
live up to the promise of the first—
the game, when it comes, proves to
be rather predictable and Mr. Tasker
is hard put to keep the tension up.
That he and John Krum'mel manage
to keep the “humped hostess” con-
clusion at all convincing and interest-
ing is their own triumph and owes
nothing to the writing.
A few discreet excisions from the
script and the printed warning on the
ticket should ensure that the sacrifice
of “America Hurrah” can now be
capitalised on but no doubt the
spectre of Mr. Willis will keep the
house full early in the season. The
“band” in the stalls on the first night
were vastly pleased with it all, and
I see no reason to doubt that those
to whom the play’s “controversial”
situation is unfamiliar will find the
play equally entertaining.
[?] dancers...incredible feats
DANCE/JOHN CARGHER
THE ULTIMATE BEST
Moiseyev’s Dance Company. Palais
Theatre, Melbourne.
THE EDGLEYS had better not bring
any more Russian dance troupes to
Australia; anything after the Moiseyev
would be an anti-climax. Just as this
program begins with deceptive calm
and gradually builds excitement on
excitement, so have the Edgleys wisely
brought the minor companies here
first, slowly building up to the grand
finale which is now upon us. This is,
indeed, the ultimate in Russian or any
other kind of folk dancing. It is, in fact,
a great deal more. Igor Moiseyev is
a professional choreographer of the
highest standard who also happens to
be a first-class theatrical showman.
No folk dancer of any nationality
could compete with these highly trained
dancers who cannot be classed as acro-
bats for the best possible reasons: their
incredible physical feats are an integral
part of their dancing skill. At no time
is there any feeling of athletic prowess,
let alone strain. Each and every one of
the enormous company “dances” in the
literal sense of the word and if there
was ever a doubt that dancing can be
a bridge of sympathetic emotions
between stage and auditorium, these
are the people to settle the argument
once and for all.
The program consists of various
dances and extracts from longer ballets.
They are, without exception, on the
highest artistic plane, yet never fail
to entertain. There is plenty of humor,
but it is never too broad; there is
some sentiment, but it is never spread
too thickly. There are even some
allusions to the last war no laugh-
ing matter which are quite incap-
able of giving offence, even to the
most sensitive soul.
The company brings its own
orchestra, which adds very considerably
to the pleasure of the evening. There
is, however, no mention of what music
is used. Clearly the Russian mind works
differently from ours, but surely some
concession could be made for Western
audiences.

MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
BREAKING THROUGH
TWO VERY heartening manifestations
of a healthy streak in Sydney’s
indigenous music-making occurred at
St. James’s Church, King Street, and
the Great Hall of the Sydney Uni-
versity; in the Church an unaccount-
ably neglected “Samson” and in the
Great Hall two major oeuvres and two
delectable side dishes.
I wonder if the description “unac-
countably neglected” is really indicative
of the treatment of Handel’s oratorios
outside “Messiah.” Handel was the most
commercial of the great composers and
the success of “Messiah” was obviously
an incentive to cash in on a going
concern. Nevertheless, although there
are magnificent and moving areas in the
other works, on the whole they lack
the consistency of his enduring master-
piece. Waft her Angels from “Jeptha”
and Sound an Alarm from “Judas Mac-
cabaeus” are unquestionably highlights,
but one would take a chance in describ-
ing He Was Despised as a “highlight”
from “Messiah.” The same criteria
could be applied to “Samson,” for the
well-known arias Total Eclipse, Honor
and Arms, and Let the Bright Seraphim
are indubitably highlights, although the
other arias and choruses are far from
pedestrian and contain some glorious
music.
A certain dichotomy was apparent in
the St. James’s “Samson,” for while the
alto, tenor, and bass soloists gave a con-
servative and unadventurous reading
of their parts Marilyn Richardson broke
into an orgy of embellishment, moving
from note to note of Handel’s music by
the longest and most devious route. No
attempt, however, was made in the
orchestra to add any baroque appen-
dages and except for Miss Richardson’s
excursions the performance was solidly
Victorian.
Differing levels were also obvious in
the work of the soloists; the two full-
time professionals, Marilyn Richard-
son and Raymond McDonald, per-,
formed with enormous assurance and
the vocally gifted singers Kerith
Fowles, contralto, and Kenneth Bur-
nett, bass, were equally accurate,
despite one rocky moment, but lacked
the projection of the others. Miss
Fowles in particular has a voice of
amazing steadiness and excellent
quality, which must .make her an in-
valuable ensemble singer, yet she failed
to imbue her words with any real
dramatic intensity.
After a rather muddy opening the
orchestra settled down to some efficient
playing. John Robertson was in his
very best form for his trumpet
obbligatos, which meant they had that
splendid ringing quality which makes
them of all noises the most joyful.
The choir sang cleanly and precisely
but adhered inexorably to a healthy
forte throughout. Probably the conduc-
tor, Walter Sutcliffe, who maintained
excellent control over his forces, found
the rehearsal time inadequate for the
realisation of dynamic subtleties.
Subtleties were given much more
cognisance in “Der Geist hilft unsrer
Schwachheit auf,” which began the con-
cert by the Leonine Consort in the
Great Hall. The old argument about
the a capella performance of Bach’s
motets is quite rightly in the discard
these days and the Leonines used bass
and continuo, but they eschewed doub-
ling the vocal parts, for they have the
technique to do so with impunity.
The Kodaly “Hymn to King
Stephen” and “Jesus and the Traders”
released some sounds of barbaric
splendor from this excellent group of
young singers. It was bad luck Purcell’s
“Come ye sons of art” became unstuck.
A misunderstanding over a repeat
seemed to start a chain reaction of
minor disasters, which resulted in a
temporary halt in the proceedings, but
everybody rallied successfully and
ploughed on. Few of the audience
could have known that the counter
tenors in this performance were boys
in their final year at Fort Street High
School, but this significant fact is
indicative of the breakthroughs which
are occurring in the approach to music
in schools.

Where fatigue is
a rich pleasure
THE NATIONAL GALLERY of Victoria, the
magnificent $l3 million first phase in the creation
of a $2O million Victorian Arts Centre complex,
has been greeted with almost unqualified praise
and visited by more than 250,000 people within
two months of its opening. Standing on a seven-
and-a-half-acre site in St. Kilda, the building
houses works of art worth more than $25 million.
Brian Brandt’s pictures on these two pages show
something of the gallery’s clean lines and extensive
area an area so great that some visitors have
enjoyed the nostalgia of “museum feet,” a com-
mon condition when trying to absorb all the
pleasures of some of the European treasure houses
in one visit, but rare in Australia.

ADVENTURES WITH
ALUMINIUM
The Comalco Invitation Award for
Sculpture in Aluminium. National
Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne.
THE Comalco Award, due to open at
Sydney’s Bonython Gallery in Novem-
ber, is unique in conception and should
be far-reaching in its effects. Six sculp-
tors, with five finally submitting work,
were invited to make a maquette of.a
free-standing, dividing screen, no more
than 2ft. wide, about 20ft. long, and
from 7 to 14ft. high. It was to allow
access at each end and hint of the
space and activity beyond it. The
theme, which will change yearly, was to
acquaint sculptors and architects with
the qualities and little-exercised uses of
aluminium.
Aluminium is generally thought to
lack density, resonance, a sense of
pressure and weight, and variety in re-
flecting surfaces; it’s not bronze, wood,
stone, perspex, or stainless steel, but
it has a unique fragile ponderousness
and it can range from a dull, misty
surface as in Norma Redpath and a
stern, sombre, anodised surtace in Inge
King to crisp, vertical angular ribbons
in Lenton Barr, whose screen moves
from sparkling silver to quiet pewter
as you walk by. Though the suggestion
may run counter to Parr’s functional
purism, this screen could be most
subtly lit.
Architects need to be alerted; funny
people, they think only of sculptural
space and ruin the Guggenheim and
London’s new Hayward Gallery as
places dealing with pictorial space.
When they “add” sculpture they usually
do one of three things: separate it as an
intruder; give it prominence if it is by
a prestigious name; or, with a house-
wife’s blend-mixer mind, lose it in
architectural homogeneity. To judge
fro'm photographs of their work, archi-
tects don’t much like sculpture, especi-
ally those clumsy, bulgy, kinetic pieces
called human beings, or, worse, clients.
Clients who see these splendid
maquettes, any of which could have
taken the $3OOO prize (each sculptor
received a fee of $750), ought to be
making demands on architects; the
conditions, display, and catalogue are
so professionally realised that they
supply excellent support for a deter-
mined client or adventurous architect.
The prize, judged by Eric West-
brook, Tony Tuckson, and architect
R. M. Simpson, went to a screen of
rods of varying thickness and brilliance
by Vincas Jomantas. About four deep,
the rods looked so like a series of
vigorous, vertical pumps that the
lateral movement, which forms the
screen, passes unnoticed. The curved
surfaces and shifting apertures entice
the eye and mind to move beyond the
screen; as with Lenton Parr the empha-
sis is on functionalism, but Norma
Redpath, Inge King, and, to a lesser
extent, Michael Nicholson take a more
symbolical, sculptural approach.
Inge King, in the valuable statement
each has made, says she was concerned
with a sculptural, monumental unit
and produces a set of sundered cliffs, a
crisp Stonehenge that has something of
Moore’s knife-edge. Movement and
placement of the three blocky shapes
are both subtly and abruptly realised,
but the piece is so demanding that if
it did suggest activity and space beyond
it would only be to announce the anni-
hilation of both.
Michael Nicholson’s partially sep-
arated forms, which he regards as a
sequence of tableaus associated with
the Gestalt cycle or the four elements
of alchemism, should prove enigmatic,
for it is a varied palisade with lots of
comforting plastic rhyme, but with a
staccato rhythm that rises to a cres-
cendo. Despite the intimate touches,
it dwarfs and intimidates, though this
may be the result of the maquette’s
compression.
Norma Redpath relaxes compression
by combining easy curves and smooth
Winning entry by Vincas Jomantas ...
“a series of vigorous, vertical pumps”
surfaces with abrupt switches and
curdled areas in her wall plaque which
is doing some anguished penance for
her coat-of-arms now above the Gal-
lery’s front arch. Miss Redpath’s
screen is really a bas-relief of distinc-
tion behind which lurk primordial
forces.
Lenton Parr, wanting to animate
surfaces, is little concerned with sug-
gesting forces and spaces beneath; his
screen is a modular variation of verti-
cal bands in bas-relief, the outer bands
allowing space and light to move
behind them and achieving some excit-
ing though uptheatrical effects. Mr.
Parr says he has tried to combine
architecture’s defining space with sculp-
ture that occupies space; a brave ambi-
tion that does, at least, suggest another
space beyond a screen that could be lit
with daily variation. It is clear that
he suffers in reduced scale, but like the
others he promises so much that let’s
hope Comalco’s worthy enterprise will
be justified by commissions where the
scale will fulfil the promise of these
pieces.


Cellar notes
from
Lindeman’s
DURING; Al (,l S I we released several
1964 vintage Dry Reds a Clare Shiraz/
Cabernet Bin 3011, and two particular
Lindeman “cellar” style wines, Claret Bin
2910 and Burgundy Bin 2920, both of
which were blends of Clare, Hunter
River Valley and Coonawarra Red Her-
mitage.
Now we are releasing a Hunter River
Burgundy of the same vintage Bin
2925 and this in turn will be followed
shortly by a Coonawarra wine 1964
Rouge Homme Claret.
The Hunter River Burgundy is an excel-
lent wine, with tremendous bouquet and
flavour. Light in colour, it is soft, round
and velvety to' taste, but is nevertheless
a firm wine with good tannin charac-
teristics on the palate.
Bin 2925 is being released under our
new, distinctive, Hunter River label,
first introduced on several special Hunter
wines last year. Most prominent on the
label is our firm’s name LINDEMAN’S
as, in itself, the designation “Hunter
River Valley” is no real guide to quality,
nor, sad to relate in certain cases, of
authenticity.
To be marketed by us as Hunter River
wines, our BEN EAN reds and whites
must reach a certain predetermined, and
inflexible, standard of quality. Regard-
less of quantity, wines below this quality
standard are relegated to blends with
other district wines, and are sold as
such, notwithstanding that they could be
marketed as Hunter River wines and in
most cases are of a higher quality than
commercial Hunters available elsewhere.
The new, distinctive label will be the
wine connoisseurs’ guarantee and hall-
mark of quality.

THE BROWNS, A
MIGHTY BUNCH OF
GRAPE GROWERS
I INTEND TO be there in the year
2001. On the first of January, 2001, I
shall be waiting, breath appropriately
bated, for the sons of the sons of
John Brown to lift the slab in the cellar
of the family winery at Milawa in
north-east Victoria.
Under this slab lie two bottles each
of the ’66 Milawa rhine riesling, the
’62 late-picked rhine riesling, a ’5B
vintage port, the ’6l shiraz cabernet,
the ’6l shiraz mondeuse cabernet, the
’64 everton claret, and the ’62 shiraz
mondeuse cabernet. Good wines all, that
will be interesting drinking in 2001.
The port certainly, the reds most prob-
ably, and the white quite possibly, will
be in splendid condition, and I look
forward to them.
The entombment took place a couple
of weeks ago when I was down in the
area. The occasion was a suitably fes-
tive one. Dr. Max Lake was hugely
there, obviously pleased to be part of
the proceedings, and another wine-
writer doctor, I’m not sure of the order
of priority, Dr. Sam Benwell, toasted
John and Pat Brown in suitably glow-
ing terms. Also on hand to give the
final nod of approval to the cement
work was a sixth-generation Milawa
Brown, the baby John Andrew, who
is the son of John Graham, the son of
John Charles, the son of John Francis,
the son of George Harry, who married
the Graham daughter, who was born
on the property.
George Harry was the first to grow
grapes, and wine was produced in the
1880 s. His son, John Francis, died in
1943 at the age of 76, and since then
John Charles, the present patriarch,
has been in charge. John Charles made
his first vintage in 1934 fresh out of
school, and has been giving loving
attention to the vines and wines ever
since. His son John Graham is now
26 years old and the eldest of four
sturdy wine fantatics. His son, John
Andrew, couldn’t care less at the
moment, but has the distinctive ruddy
cheeks of all the family.
The occasion marked the comple-
tion of the new bottling-hall and cellar.
Now a big company can spend hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars on new
equipment and buildings and I would
not drive 400 miles to be at the open-
ing. But the Browns are something
special as far as I’m concerned and I
know others feel the same way. They
are such a family unit, full of mutual
respect and love, and they work and
relax and plan together as a unit.
In fact, the new buildings and cellar
were built by the sons themselves.
John Graham was the designer, and he
and Peter, with help from Ross and
Roger (the latter aged 12) laid the
bricks, and poured the concrete, and
welded the trusses and sheeted the roof.
The only thing they couldn’t do was
install the electrical wiring, and I can’t
imagine why at least one Brown has
not got his union ticket.
The weekend also provided us with
an opportunity to taste a range of
Milawa reds, to add another definitive
tasting to our growing list. In the after-
noon we tasted the current whites. The
’67 rhine riesling was the best of
these. This lacks the characteristic
fragrant fruitiness of many of the rhine
rieslings we see today, but to make up
for this, does not suffer from the char-
acteristic lack of guts on the middle
palate of most of those wines. Call it
intensity of flavor if you find my words
too harsh. The Milawa rhine riesling
has got plenty of flavor and fruit on
the middle palate, but this fruit is not
as aromatic and flowery as that of
others. Yet the wine has good balance,
clean acid, and plenty of style. It has
more body than usual, though there is
no hint of coarseness or flabbiness. I
liked it very much.
The ’67 frontignac I liked less. Any-
one who can make good whites out of
Brown Muscat is to be applauded, and
John Brown is no exception. However,
’67 was a hot year, and though this
wine is soft and appealing with good
flavor and balance, it lacks the crisp-
ness of delicacy one looks for to coun-
teract the abundance of varietal char-
acter there. The ’67 tokay is interesting,
being a sweet wine, fine and well
balanced, that is not either of the
sauterne or spatlese styles. It has typi-
cal flavor, good acid and balance,
finishes dry in the mouth, and is quite
sweet on the palate.
The reds were more my glass of
vino. Starting with • the ’67 shiraz
cabernet, which was almost the best
wine of the lot. This has definite caber-
net fruit which is quite marked on the
nose and palate. And not to be
wondered at, for half the wine is of
that variety. The rest is made up of
shiraz, and this flavor is strongest as
the wine leaves the mouth. I spotted
specific regional character in many of
the subsequent reds. The ’67 shiraz
cabernet has it, too, but it is not as
full and definite in this wine which
has considerable finesse besides. It will
live and grow in the bottle for at
least another four or five years, and will
be very good drinking then. It has only
been bottled in the last month and
there is still so'me of it in wood, some
even in the original casks that were first
used in the ’Bos. The cabernet, which
yields about If tons per acre, and the
shiraz (about 2 tons per acre) are
picked together at about
Beaume and are crushed and pressed
as a blend. Incidentally, for those avid
purchasers and cellarers among you,
the wine is available for a dollar a
bottle, which I believe is very good
value today. But don’t write and ask
for more than a case or so or you’ll
embarrass a good bloke. (H. G. Brown
is the agent in Sydney.)
The two other ’67s I didn’t like as
much. The straight shiraz is a more

common wine, has plenty of fruit and
body, in fact is more regional in style
altogether. It’s an ideal sort of wine
for those who like plenty of strength,
substance, smoothness, and softness in
a wine. It should be kept for a couple
of years or so. The ’67 shiraz mondeuse
is also soft and has assertive regional
fruit, but there is some H2S evident
that doec not anneal that rmirh
tV u- PP u h u u
The 66 shiraz cabernet is much the
same sort of wine as the 67 with
obviously a year more in the bottle.
I thought it to be just a shade heavier
and fuller, but as near as dammit for
practical purposes. This also contains
a high proportion of cabernet. The 65
shiraz cabernet contains less about
25 percent, in fact, and this may be the
reason for the wine lacking bouquet.
This is its only fault, for the middle
palate fruit is extra good and there is a
ton of flavor. This is rather an austere
wine quite firm at the end of the palate
and finish. I liked it. By austere I hope
to convey that a wine has a sort of
refined firmness, not a hardness or
coarseness of palate, nor a thinness and
washiness on the other hand. It’s just
austere. I he opposite of being a gener-
ous wine.
The 64 everton claret, from their
property about ten miles away from the
main vineyard area at Milawa, is
mainly a shiraz with about ten percent
cabernet added. This has a strong
regional shiraz character, though it is
not as big as the ’67 shiraz, and though
the tannin and acid are soft it still
needs plenty of age.
The ’63 shiraz cabernet, containing
ab ° ut P eicent tbe l atter variety
. ad evea mOI T iegional character. This
j' s a fu L earthy, slightly spicy, gutsy,
hard-baked, mouth-filling style if you
see what I mean (yet still by no means
as hig as some of the black-red wines
of the area). A very fruity, generous
sort of a w A e Generous? Oh, well, it’s
t h e opposite of austere.
The , g 2 shiraz mondeuse ca b e rnet
was a bea ut wine. A subtle, elegant
nose show i ng marked bottle age, fine
and full of de ii cate perfumes. Terrific
fl avo r, light bo died yet intense, with
no marked earthy style and no hint of
f u n ne ss or coarseness. A soft, clean,
persistent tannin finish, very bordeaux
in character . A top wine altogether,
w j th a slight fault of some volatility.
The > gl had somet hing of the same
fl avo rs, though it was bigger and fuller
and fruitien There was somet hing of
late-picked very ripe grapes in' the

j W asn’t so pleased with the older
wines, though some of the party present
were obviously so delighted with them,
I had to have a good second look at
each of them. The ’6O shiraz was a
big dumb wine, too hard on the palate
and also showing some volatility. The
’59 shiraz was a much better wine,
lacking the bouquet you might expect
from seven years in the bottle, but
with good developed flavor. This was
also slightly hard. The ’5B was harder
having better fruit than the ’6O but
st iH a bit lacking in quality. The ’57

Opera House spending
For a short outline of the Common-
wealth-States feud over finances, and
allocation thereof, “The Coming
Revolt of the States” (8., September
14) provides interesting reading. To my
mind, however, a burning question
remains unanswered. In all conscience
how can Mr. Askin justify the N.S.W.
position in the light of the prodigal
Sydney Opera House spending?
G. G. Clark
Townsville, Qld.
Thinking nationally or
internationally?
When “Observer” (8., September 28)
comments on Mr. Gorton’s tentative
attempts to give Australia a “sense of
national purpose” and criticises him
for not providing direct and concrete
material goals rather than a mere
dream, I feel that his applause is some-
what misdirected.
I feel that an underlying attitude to
policy in the Govern'ment such as this
would only serve to make Australia
more provincial than ever. We are all
aware of the rather obvious fact that
modern technology has produced a
world-wide system of transport and
communications which has brought
nations so much closer together that
geography no longer plays an import-
ant role in the limits between one indi-
vidual state and another. The trend in
international relations is moving toward
larger political systems. “Nationalism”
confined to the limits of a small geo-
graphical entity such as Australia will
become out of date.
Thus, to adopt a policy limited to
Australian objectives alone would be,
in years to come, detrimental to Aus-
tralian interests through the narrowness
of the view of “progress” it assumes.
One can, of course, see that as a short-
term policy the aims underlying
“Observer’s” discussion of Mr. Gorton’s
remarks would advance Australia
materially. A sense of national purpose
such as this, however, once instilled as
an incentive to national advancement,
would be very difficult either to eradi-
cate or redirect, and to encourage a
government to think in international
rather than national terms would be an
almost insurmountable task.

with their own language and customs,
and none Ibo-speaking.
Apart from the field at Imo River,
none of the rich oil fields in the former
Eastern Region were in Ibo territory.
Port Harcourt, e.g., where I lived for
many years, was “Rivers,” or Ijaw,
territory. The minority tribes of the
Eastern Region have been consistently
victimised and subdued by the Ibo
political majority, have nothing in
common with the Ibos, and mainly
have no wish to be associated with them
in Biafra.
The above figures may be checked
with the Nigerian High Commission in
Canberra, who should also be able to
supply a pamphlet entitled “Ojukwu’s
Rebellion and World Opinion,” written
by Dr. Nabo Graham-Douglas, a
“Rivers Man,” who was a for’mer
Attorney-General in the Former East
who resigned in September, 1966 (and
later held in detention by the Ibos),
largely because at that early date his
advice against secession went unheeded.

"Chartist" graphs
The space in your excellent investment
section is much too valuable to be
wasted on the nonsense which eman-
ates from someone called “The Chart-
ist.” Try as I may, I fail to compre-
hend how any graph, regardless of
the number of straight and “meaning-
ful” lines inscribed thereon, can be
used to predict share-price trends.
There appears to be no limit to the
number of peaks and troughs this per-
sonage can join together while chant-
ing magical phrases such as “support
level,” “descending triangle,” and
“pullback rally.” He then has the
impertinence to “predict” the future
price of that unfortunate stock upon
which his eye has fallen. Of course, the
fact that the more gullible section of
the investing public may be influenced
by this unscientific mumbo-jumbo is
conveniently ignored. For instance,
when a price decline is “predicted,”
could not this itself precipitate a
certain amount of selling so that the
“prediction” becomes actuality?

The Ord and Australia
I noted with much regret the re-
currence of Peter Samuel’s description
of the Ord River Scheme as “Gran-
diose Anti-Development.” It is incred-
ibly short-sighted and rather stupid to
describe Northern Developmental pro-
jects in this way.
The significance of the Ord Scheme
is that it provides for the first time a
nucleus of close settlement based on
agriculture in the area, from which
secondary development will follow
just as development followed the
settlements at Port Jackson and on
the Yarra River.
An immediate benefit will be the
stabilisation of the northern pastoral
industry with feed from the Ord farms.
The Ord cotton “problem” is really
just the difference in timing of seasons,
as the Ord crop is ready later than
the N.S.W., and were ths seasons
reversed the “problem” would be the
N.S.W. cotton crop.
However, one would be more im-
pressed if, instead of regarding sub-
sidisation as the only answer short of
the co'mplete negativism of advoca-
ting abandonment of the Ord, thought
had been directed to Australia’s broad
need to increase manufactured exports
in the form of a suggestion to increase
the efficiency of the Australian cotton-
manufacturing industry so that absorp-
tion of the entire domestic cotton crop
in manufacturing for world markets
became feasible.
The widespread attitude of deprecia-
tion of Northern Development in
south-eastern Australia explodes the
myth of Australian economic
dynamism. The vision of most Austra-
lian economises and Government
advisers seems largely limited to Syd-
ney and Melbourne, and even then
little imagination is evident in their
planning, and it is not too much to
doubt Australia would never survive
by design, though we might, as we
have, avoid by accident the type of
economic challenge Britain faces.
Were it not for the prospect of W.A.
mineral export earnings and capital
inflow, a large proportion of which
has been attracted by W.A., Australia
would today face serious balance of
payments problems, and last November
would have been in New Zealand’s
humiliating and condescendingly
referred-to position of “meekly follow-
ing sterling devaluation.”
But in the general pleasure over the
growth of the economy the fact that
the development in Western Australia,
which this growth is chiefly due to, has
occurred in the face of severe opposi-
tion and from south-eastern
Australia is overlooked, and the lesson
that these developments are the product
of careful but imaginatively realistic
planning by the Government of
Western Australia is lost.
As a part of this the significance of
the Ord River Scheme is not under-
stood, and the plans of the W.A. Gov-
ernment to develop other irrigation
schemes and to stabilise the mineral
export industry by expanding the mar-
keting field to Europe and North
America and to develop close settle-
ment and secondary industry with a
population of over one-quarter million
within ten years in the Pilbarra is
regarded with either amused or angry
scepticism and, most incredibly, the
importance of these large but realistic
and carefully planned projects to the
Australian economy is seemingly not
appreciated.
