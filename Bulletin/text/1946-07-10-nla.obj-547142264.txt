LONDON AS QUEEN VICTORIA KNEW THE HEART OF EMPIRE.
Old Houses at Holborn Bars.
TN this series of London views during the reign of Queen Victoria
featured by the House of Seppelts interest attaches to this view
of the old houses which stood at Staple Inn, where Dr. Johnson
lived and wrote Rasselas. An important thoroughfare for hundreds
of years, Holborn was the route along which the condemned passed
from the Tower or Newgate to Tyburn. Bordered by the Inns of
Court, Holborn must have presented a busy scene. This district
escaped the Great Fire, but has been greatly altered in the march
of progress. Called the “Bars,” the granite obelisks, of which
one is shown in this view, marked the boundary of the City Liber-
ties, where a toll had to be paid for vehicles entering London.
From this area to Drury Lane this street is known as High Holborn*
where the Holborn Council now owns handsome buildings.

ADVENTURE AND ANATOMY
Mr. Cleary, writing his short stories
mostly in the first person, records more
temperately (page seven) “I felt my heart
go big within me” and (page 16) “Them
I saw just how big and unselfish was his"
heart.” -—
In the same modest, moderate yet
determined manner, the stories, which
are mostly concerned with Aus-
tralian soldiers in the Middle East, offer
a number of other physiological de-
tails: page three, “a hollowness inside
and a big feeling in his throat, the way
he’d had it a§ a kid when he felt like
crying”; page seven, “There was a lump
in my throat that I couldn’t swallow”;
page 17, “We went out and our sighs of
relief cut off like a finger put over the
teat of a depressing football bladder”;
page 24, ‘1 hated the Germans so much
for it it hurt my guts”; page 26, “I took
her in my arms and kissed her good and
hard and long”; page 36, “I feel my
heart start to pound and I am itching in
my palms, and there and then I want
to kiss her good and hard and improper”;
page 48, “I feel as if someone has just
hit me hard in the belly, all hollow in-
side”; and so on—not too often, for-
tunately—until the “I” is back in Adel-
aide, and, “Coming up for air, she laughs
‘You don’t seem to be out of practice.’
I grin and don’t say anything. I just
kiss her again.”
These, it may seem, are small
blemishes. But in their total they are not.
Essentially both readable and likeable,
with humor, color and a true appre-
ciation of the heroic, Mr. Cleary
is spoiling his writing by a succes-
sion of tiny lapses enfeebling the
impact of the whole. Though one
must not confuse the author with the
fictional “I” of the stories it is almost
impossible not to pause and grin—quite
at the wrong moments —at the thought
of how nice it must be for the girls
to be kissed by Mr. Cleary. Which is
not at all the effect the author intends
to achieve.
And, really, because of this same
danger of confusing the author with his
“I,” it is not desirable for a short story
to be, as it were, a peep down the writer’s
throat. Continually to trot out for in-
spection the Adam’s apple, the heart, the
belly—and why not the lights, the liver
and the kidneys?—is carrying “realism”
altogether too far.
Too far, because it fails altogether to
make its intended impression of tough-
ness. Indeed, the effect is the opposite.
Not only is all dignity lost—one cannot
imagine Scott or Conrad thus naively
offering for inspection their private an-
atomy —but the soldiers, at the moments
when their hearts are big and their throats
lumpy, seem weak, self-pitying, effemi-
nate.
Even at their best, when they are gay
and masculine and adventurous, they
are not quite real; puppets in an Ameri-
can fantasy. For, of course, Mr. Cleary
is under the influence of Hemingway and
the other modern Americans.
The influence is shown at its simplest
in the occasional Americanisms in the
dialogue: “We feel hungry and eat some
bully-beef and biscuits. They taste
swell.” Less obviously, it is nonetheless
present in “You Gotta Be Modest,”
which, though the most conscientiously
Australian of all the stories, is written in
the characteristic rhythm of Damon Run-
yon.
And, too, it is the American maga-
zine influence that makes Mr. Cleary’s
prose, at times, go plain mad. The dic-
tionary contains no such word as “scaven-
gous”; “His objective was now instinc-
tive” is both ungrammatical and jingly;
the word “stark” is meaningless in the
sentence “She waves, a gesture that
already seems stark, and goes inside”:
but in the current American fashion
awkwardness and inefficiency are re-
garded as “new,” “experimental” and
therefore admirable. Hemingway has
certain virtues; but the simple truth
might be that he doesn’t write better
English because he can’t. The fact is
also worth considering that the Hem-
ingway hero —the Dumb Ox, Wyndham
Lewis called him —is incapable of
thought.
For it may be the American influence
that makes Mr. Cleary’s stories, attractive
though many of them are as simple
descriptions of action, seem, beside Con-
rad’s, shallow. “The Convert,” for in-
stance, one of the best narratives of action
in the book, concerns a soldier who is
known to hate the killing in war but who,
after encountering a German atrocity,
shoots a couple of prisoners: —
Tarrant spoke to the officer. “I think
the account has been paid off, sir. Only
one prisoner was taken.”
His voice was soft but soft like steel dull
in starlight, and there was a hardness about
him that hadn’t been there before. We
were looking at a new Tarrant.
Leaving a man with the officer and the
German corporal we went forward again,
up over the ridge, and I was beside Tar-
rant and I could see the light in his
eyes and the expectancy in the firm set of
his mouth. He had lost his hate of kill-
ing—he had another hate now. He had
an interest in the business.
Mr, Cleary may be right in his psy-
chology ; certainly it’s a lively yarn;
but one would like to feel assured he
had considered the possibility that an
ostentatious “hate” of killing may be
merely a mask for the desire to kill.
It should be said first of all that there
is nothing in Jon Cleary’s These Small
Glories (Angus and Robertson) quite so
extravagant as the anatomical informa-
tion that was offered by James Aldridge
in his recent novel The Sea Eagle. Mr.
Aldridge credited his Australian hero with
having a “240-horsepower engine inside
him” —his heart.
Connoisseurs of the Orchid.
One of the most pleasing things about
J. Murray Cox’s A Cultural Table of
Orchidaceous Plants (Shepherd Press,
Sydney) is the author’s affection for the
wild orchids of Australia;
Dendrobium monophyllum is a dainty
little flower with its golden-yellow spray of
bell-like blossoms, but on account of its
manner of growth we are apt to treat it
with little regard. Picture, however, a great
rock higher than the wall of a room, and
about fifteen feet long, standing a few feet
from a precipice, with the whole of its
eastern face densely covered with myriads
of these golden-hued blossoms gleaming in
the morning sun
Cunningham’s Gap is a passageway
through the Dividing Range, making a
direct route between Brisbane and Warwick.
On the south side of the Gap is pyramid-
shaped Mt. Mitchell, and on the northern
side is Mt. Cordeaux towering 4000 fdet
skywards. The lower slopes of these
mountains are covered with a dense scrub
through which great trees push their way
sunwards. Almost every tree has its upper
portion shrouded with great clumps of
Dendrobium speciosum. At the time of
my visit (September) these were all in
flower, and the long sprays of cream-
colored blossoms with here and there one
of the rarer white variety ( Hillii ) made a
charming sight upon which one’s eyes never
tired of feasting But right on the rocky
cliffs at the head of the mount was the
. crowning glory of all. Great masses of
Dendrobium kingianum there were, with
numberless blooms running the whole gamut
of color from pale lilac to a deep purple
which would have mocked the robes of an
emperor, and with a fragrance like the
incense from an old cathedral.
As the formidable title indicates, A
Cultural Table of Orchidaceous Plants is
intended for the specialist: the estab-
lished grower of orchids or the neophyte
anxious to learn. As such, it is hard to
imagine that it could be bettered. It is
beautifully produced—a handsome, digni-
fied book with 80 illustrations, 13 in full
color: among the latter a reproduction of
an oil painting by A. J. Sherman. It
lists, describes and tells how to grow a
most comprehensive range of orchids
from all over the world.
Connoisseurship in any form —from
the collection of books and pictures to the
worship of furniture, china or even post-
age stamps—is a mark of civilisation, and
a very pleasing thing to see in Australia.
And Australian orchid-fanciers are more
numerous than may be generally known:
the Orchid Society of New South Wales,
affiliated with the Newcastle Orchid
Circle, the Queensland Orchid Society
and the Victorian Orchid Club, publishes
an “Australian Orchid Review” every
quarter, and the magazine has a circula-
tion of 1500.
But the knowledge of the Australian
orchids shouldn’t be confined to the con-
noisseurs. There would be a ready sale
for a popular book on the subject, some-
thing on the lines of Charles Barrett’s
writings, or Archer Russell’s Bush
Ways, recently reviewed on this page.
And Mr. Cox would be the right man to
do the job. He knows literature as well
as orchids —there are quotations from
Keats and Cabell’s Jtirgen among his
learned notes on composts; his writing
can bring a wild scene vividly and attrac-
tively before the eye ; and it’s obvious that
it’s the Australian orchids —and the Aus-
tralian bush as a whole —that are the
real love of his heart.
Another specimen of connoisseurship
published simultaneously by the Shepherd
Press is A Working List of Australian
Birds; Including the Australian Quadrant
and New Zealand by Gregory M.
Matthews. Somewhat startling to the
layman in its erudition, no doubt it admir-
ably fulfils its purpose as “a working list -
for students of Australian ornithology.”
In Search of Mosquitoes.
One would hardly expect a book about
malaria to be pleasant general reading,
but Dr. Marshall A. Barber’s A Malari-
ologist in Many Lands (University of
Kansas Press) has the pastoral charm
usually to be found only in the writings
of naturalists. Almost, though his prey
is the anopheles mosquito, it reads like
the notebook of a fisherman:
Gambusia minnows are very efficient in
destroying larvae, beginning their attacks
when still of that small size described by
Dr. Henry Carter as consisting essentially
of “two eyes and a tail.” They often
creep through aquatic grasses infested by
mosquito larvae and clean out practically
all of them. But the minnows have one
great drawback: if the anopheline larvae
feed quietly among horizontal grasses, algae,
or other vegetation, as they frequently do,
the minnows may leave them untouched.
If something stirs up the larvae so that
they wriggle over the surface, the minnows
quickly dart at-them. One observes the
same behavior among large predatory
animals; the prey may escape if if lies
perfectly still.
One wonders if it might not be possible
to improve a race of Gambusice so as to
make the minnows more enterprising....
Dr. Barber has gone creeping among
aquatic grasses in the U.S., the Philip-
pines, Malaya, Fiji, Equatorial Africa,
Russia, India, Brazil and elsewhere, and
has been described by the U.S. War De-
partment as “one of the most noted
malariologists in the world.’’ His obser-
vations —particularly on irrigation and on
the aeroplane as a carrier of the ano-
pheles—are of considerable interest to
Australia, even though he does not deal
specifically with Australian problems:
We have seen what disaster was brought
to Brazil by the chance importation of a
single mosquito species, and we should re-
member that its source, West Africa, is very
large, is heavily infested, and is now situ-
ated on various highways of travel.
Further, we may expect a great increase
in the amount of irrigation during the next
few decades, since so much of this planet
is dry where it needs to be moist. The
new powerful atomic explosives may open
a peaceful way, even in parts of the Sahara
Desert, for water to enter millions of acres
now considered hopelessly arid; and we
have seen how many countries become
malaria-infested through irrigation. If
we cannot introduce the good without
bringing in the evil with it we cannot
expect the unmixed thanks of our day
and generation.
There should also be some interest for
this country in the account of a diabolical
plot against locusts in the Philippines—
an attempt to slay them by bacteriological
warfare which, though Dr. Barber did
not succeed with it, is reported to have
succeeded in France,
A good deal lighter and slighter than
Dr. S. M. Lambert’s A Doctor in Para-
dise, Dr. Barber’s book is, nevertheless,
in the same category: for it has both
humor and humanity, and the author is
an adventurer as well as a scientist. The
American doctors, happily chasing their
tapeworms or mosquitoes all over the
globe, remind one, • somehow, of the
gentlemen of old who set- sail for El
Dorado. And certainly Columbus, when
he sighted land, got no greater joy than
does Dr. Barber when he pounces in
some watery place upon the larvae of
anopheles or when, after three times de-
liberately giving himself the most agonis-
ing stomach aches, he discovers that it is
“staphylococcus carried by an old cow
with a history of garget” that has been
causing a mysterious sickness on a re-
mote farm in the Philippines.
Mighty Midgets: Lieut. John F.
Moyes, R.A.N.V.R. (N.S.W. Bookstall
Co.). The work of the small ships of the
Australian Navy, spread out over 13
short chapters. There is some interesting
and historically important information
but the style is marred by cliches—the
ready-made generalisms of a writer who
senses the dramatic heights within the
matter he is treating, but doesn’t quite
succeed in conveying these impressions
to the reader.

A DRUM FOR BEN BOYD.
V. SIR OSWALD BRIERLY.
You will not find me lurking in the shadows
With lips tensed to erupt some boiling truth;
Nor quivering in some dusty photograph
As a queer white sign glowering mortality;
Not even as an echo, fiftieth part of substance;
Nor as the wavering line of a submerged city
Though you stare at zenith noon, with sun
behind you.
True to myself, I grew colorless, left no self-
portrait.
Why battle for a foothold in common thought?
I waged too many battles in myself:
The fratricidal shock of elements
Natural to each other.
Like high clouds running counter to the earth-
wind.
Wits wrestled fingers, and what bird struggling
home
Drops a careful pinion for posterity?
Ben Boyd? Just such another element,
No more human than the air we breathe,
Yet it brings life. 1 always think of him
As something past purpose, insensate, batter-
ing cliffs
With a forehead fruitless and obstinate as the
surf; '
And yet the air for miles around any cliff
is charged with countless poems (mostly un-
written).
Something draws you to a cliff —you see your-
self
Enlarged, and sometimes you hate the surf
As sometimes 1 hated Boyd, you feel ominous
currents
Dragging you away from humanity.
But, passing on,
You do not quickly forget such magnitudes.
While I wait quietly, his town falls, stone by
stone, . ,
Gossip seeks new ventures. Sometimes a tale
Lags about like smoke on the sluggish wharves,
A tale of .death in various distant places
And in the wildest garb you could well think
of: .
A duel across a table in California,
A slow starvation in a derelict yacht,
A lonely struggle on some cannibal island,
Always the tale brings death.
No hope, no pity
Keeps me away from the canvas, but there’s
something missing.
I paint from memory mostly, build a landscape
Crowded with whaling-ships, but all at anchor,
And rarely venture out beyond the shoreline.
Something in my. brain is atrophied, fallen
away, .
And this, I suppose you could say, is Boyd or
something about him.
N.S.W.
VI. A WHALER.
A dressed-up ape with a patronising stick
Pointing you out. to his friends as a sound
machine
Capable of so many tricks when fed on three-
pence—
There’s Mr. Blasted Boyd. He owns us all
And cracks the whip too often for my liking.
The shepherds are spitting froth: twice as
many sheep
To nurse for half the pay.
But they’re all the same,
These yellow little rats burrowing into the land:
They give you a smile and words like knives
when behind you.
Give me the water, miles from the smell of
them.
Our niggers think that after the sea’s got them
They can become killers and streak out, fathoms
down,
With the certainty of spiking their teeth into
something.
Pretty smart for niggers—they hate the city, too.
When dirty air’s in, my mouth and everyone’s
yapping
I think of the' water, lonely and asking nothing,
With no whales inspecting you through a
monocle,
And a clean wind, not stained with rotten
cabbages.
I think of the grey rain smothering our lights,
Qf the sun rattling through black and silver
foam,
Of the chase with my hands blistering on the
sweep,
Of the butting squalls, and the days of green
quietness—
Then there’s one thing left: to get drunk and
frighten a policeman.
VII. A PAPUAN SHEPHERD.
Through the thick morning steam they took
shape,
With nerce white symbols shaking above them
in air:
Sea-monsters from icy regions bringing cold
tides with them.
Some of us trembled and clapped hands slowly
in fear,
While others fingered their spears and stone in
doubt;
But when flame sprang, and spirits squeaked
overhead
And an incredible thunder troubled the trees,
We crouched in terror lest our sky drip blood.
And then the men with bloodless brittle faces,
With ferocious prayers, solemn and rhythmical,
Seized many of us, the young and the virile,
Dragging us through the surf to impure burial
In the bellies of their tamed monsters.
So we saw
Our gods fall back defeated to the green lands
Fading into mist, leaving us to struggle
With rages and subtleties that no one under-
stands.
Out in these bare places a poison wrings
Power from my arms; each new night spits ice,
And I am forgetting the songs and the careless
fishing,
The old lighting and the old peace.
VIII.
Brierly dreams of a studio,
The Governor’s portrait, grave magisterial duties,
Of evening’s wrangle with planes of assailing
color,
And trapping snaky clippers—but Boyd dreams
of cities
Bleeding the hardy pastures with new wounds;
Of dead whales scarring the beaches; of the
gulls
Haunting their epic, tumbling skeletons;
Of churches and pubs at decent intervals;
And packets with old names curled about their
bows
Running deft passage, urged by steam and sail,
Sniffing out merchandise at curious inlets,
Fore-runners of coast's subdued by facade and
wall.
Out of fools and incredulity
Boyd built his town, ran the whole baffling
range . . ... . ~ ..
Of a mad whim, and, which was wilder, held it
A dizzy second before the foundering and the
plunge,
Summary of Knossos and sweep of Nineveh.
The cities feed only on a common will;
Yet all the poetry of a tower’s ascent
Leaps out most powerfully in its rocking and
fall.
Francis Webb.

JUST HOW MUCH
IS OUH
£1
WORTH ?
The real value of our money depends
on how and when we spend it . . . for
money is worth only as much as it will
buy. If we pay £1 for 15/- worth of
goods, our pound is worth only 15/- —
not good business from our point of
view. And that is just what some
people are prepared to do to-day. By
competing witla each other to buy
various commodities in short supply,
they force prices UP . . . and the value
of their money DOWN!
So let us wisely insist on 20/- good
value for £1 spent, and thus help to
maintain the purchasing power of our
money at its correct level. Let’s rigidly
observe the ceiling prices set on various
articles, and abide by the rationing of
scarce goods . . . for these controls are
all designed to keep those prices down.
Let us buy only what we really need
and invest the money saved at better
than bank interest in Commonwealth
Bonds and Savings Certificates. That’s
the way to collect a handy little nest-
egg for the days of plenty to come , . .
when our £1 note will pack a bigger
punch.
Savings Certificates may be purchased
at any Bank or Money Order Post
Office* and advance subscriptions to
the next Commonwealth Cash Loan
may be made through any Bank or
Stockbroker.
THIS IS HOW YOU CAN HELP
TO KEEP PRICES DOWN
1. Spend wisely. Get full value. Buy only
what you really need. Save all you can.
Hold all your Bonds and Savings Certificates.
2. Share and share alike the goods avail-
able . . . don’t fostet the black market by
paying more than maximum prices. Check
all prices with the lists available.
3. Keep your prices down. Don’t take ad-
vantage of shortages to ask more for your
goods or services.
4. Pay your way—settle your debts—make
no new ones.
5. Invest your savings, at better than bank
interest, in Commonwealth Bonds and
Savings Certificates. When goods are plen-
tiful again you can make good use of the
money you save now—for then you will get
more for your money in everything you buy.

How to preserve eggs in salt and lime solu-
tion ?
The solution is formed by mixing freshly-
slaked lime at the rate of 21b. to five gallons
of water, stirring three times per day until a
milky fluid is formed. To this solution lib. of
fine salt should be added. After being allowed
to stand for several hours, the liquid should
be poured off; it is then ready for the eggs.

How to dye a hide black (it has been well
tanned with salt and alum)?
Brush the surface with a solution of 3oz.
logwood or hematini crystals to the gallon,
adding about loz. of ammonia. Then brush
with a solution containing bani black
dissolved in boiling water and applied while
hot. Repeat if necessary.

Re killing weeds in onions (B. 19/6/’46). As
protective rubber clothing and special spraying
equipment is not obtainable, and the average man
may strike trouble using the acid, it may be ad-
visable to use dinitro-o-cresylate (Dinoc). Under
ordinary circumstances, spray when the first
leaf starts to dry up, when there will usually
be two to three leaves showing. The tips may
burn but the plant will recover. The mix-
ture for this spray is a gallon of Dinoc to
100 gallons of water per acre, with an acti-
vator of lib. to 31b. of sulphate of ammonia

Men who saw war-time service in Britain enjoyed one feature
of life over there which is sadly lacking here. That is the cheerfulness, homeli-
ness and unfailing hospitality of British inns and hotels. For the British inn is
more than merely a place in which to drink ... it is the ordinary people’s “club,”
a place to meet one’s friends, to sit in comfort and enjoy a drink as a pleasant
accompaniment to conversation and good fellowship.
Why should similar conditions be denied us here? Why should we be
obliged to drink at crowded bars, in haste and discomfort, with “one eye on
the clock”? Until six o’clock closing is abandoned and hotel trading hours are
altered to meet the needs and wishes of the community, there can be no pro-
gress towards reasonable and moderate drinking conditions in this State.

The Saintliness of Grey
No. 3 of "The Cookabundy Chronicles”
BY BRIAN JAMES
I NTO the little world bounded by the
Cookabundy, Greg came like a breath
from a much higher and better world;
and it says much for poor human
nature, debased as it so often is, that at
once it recognised the saintliness of Greg.
Not the hardness- of the legendary
saints, not their aggressive goodness, nor
their grim determination to be martyrs ;
not their provocative virtues that must
often have stirred ordinary folk into
making martyrs of them. No, Greg’s
saintliness was of an easy, soothing kind
that made sinners feel better and not a
whole lot worse. Nor did Greg assume
the saint —he was just a sinner like other
folk, though he didn’t sin. No One could
imagine Greg actively engaged in sin.
(To the virtuous there is only one sin.)
Greg, full name Gregory Hare, was the
son of Cornelius Hare, of Summerlea —
saddler and harnessmaker. There was
nothing very remarkable about old
Conny, apart from the fact that he wore
very large glasses, was very dirty, and
made good, honest harness and saddles.
Hard old fellow, too, and he had really
ferocious leanings about “tick” and bad
debts. Clearly it was from his mother
that Greg got much of his goodness,
though doubtless much of it, too, was his
own. Mrs. Hare was known to have
said, even in the days of Greg’s infancy,
that “Greg was different,” which was dis-
cerning of her, for Greg was different —
very different.
At an early age Greg was sent, on
account of the “difference,” to a school
in Sydney where distinct encouragement
was given to piety, and Summerlea hardly
knew him for many years, but more or
less vaguely understood that Greg was
about to “enter the Church,” It seemed
that he was in this process of entering
for a long time.
Now he returned to Summerlea, at the
age of thirty-two, a big smooth man,
handsome and good to look upon, mild
and benign. Round of face, and the
broadness and height of forehead were
accentuated by the receding of his brown,
hair. Steady brown eyes that looked
tolerance and smote not.
Someone said that his face had strong
resemblance to a mullet, but if that was
so it must be conceded that it was at
least a warm-blooded mullet.
Clad in neat, conventional, black coat
a trifle longer than the usual, but not too
long, Greg looked distinguished, and
had a certain clerical air about him. He
had not yet entered the Church, but it
was understood that he was likely to at
any moment.
Greg walked into his father’s shop and
announced himself with just the right
degree of enthusiasm. “I’m back, father.”
The old man looked up and peered a
moment over his big spectacles and said:
“So I see.” Then he resumed his rivet-
ing of some harness.
Greg wasn’t annoyed—he was never
annoyed—he just waited till the hammer
stopped and asked Conny how he was.
Conny grunted, perhaps because he had
rivets in his mouth at the time. But
Greg understood —he always did.
“And all the family—God bless them?”
Another grunt seemed to indicate that
the family was well,
Greg didn’t worry his father with more
talk. It wasn’t his way to Worry people.
In any case, his father was busy and
rivets in his mouth made talking a positive
danger.
So Greg sauntered gently through the
place, humming softly some sacred song
about God’s love for all. But tears came
into his eyes when he beheld the room
where he and two of his brothers used to
sleep long ago. It was the memory of those
happy days that brought the fears, cer-
tainly not the sight of three sets of exhibi-
tion harness that now occupied the room.
He wandered over the backyard and a
slight twinge of pain came at the sight of
it now, neglected, wild, unkempt and over-
grown with docks, thistles and horehound.
In one comer was the straggling pepper-
corn, still acting as covering and screen
for the lavatory. In the other corner was
the weeping myall-tree, where his younger
brother broke his arm —and his father
had chastised the rest of them (he belted
them with an old stirrup strap) for climb-
ing the tree. Greg didn’t blame his father,
though he himself had not climbed the
tree, knowing that it was wrong to do so.
Poor father! He meditated ; how prone
to unreasoning anger he used to be! And
how obstinate —yes, obstinate, there was
no other word for it —he was over the
matter of entering the Church.
He sighed again as he thought of his
mother, dead these years now. It was
sweet to think that she went straight to
Heaven —as indeed she should have gone.
He thought of the cross she had to bear.
It was no use blinking the fact —father
was the major portion of that cross. In
fact, the lot of it,
GREG went out the side gate and down
the street. His face, at once benign
and sad, bore the look appropriate to
one who was about to stand by the grave-
side of his mother. A certain uneasi-
ness, barely perceptible, may have been
due to the fact that the cemetery lay so
far out of town.
It was a hot day for walking.
But at the butter factory Greg found
a young fellow just leaving with a light
van of empty cans. Greg askgd in his
invariably soothing tones if a little extra
weight (in reality a good deal extra) would
seriously inconvenience the horses. He
was assured it wouldn’t. The young fel-
low was flattered by the address of the
stranger—for he didn’t know Greg.
The horses would have been flattered,
too, had they known, and if the heat
and flies weren’t so troublesome. They
trotted along, deep in their private griev-
ances, at a jig-jog which was almost as
fast as walking. But they had been go-
ing to that factory for years, and they
knew that speed was not in the best
traditions of butter. Occasionally the
young fellow relaxed the loose reins still
more, raised his driving hand, and then
allowed the reins to drop on the horses’
backs. Both horses flicked their tails as
a token of recognition, and went along
at the same pace as before.
Or in colorless tones the young fellow
informed the horses that they were “a
pair of bastards,” without any bitterness
or conviction, and gave each horse in
turn a painless flick with the absurdly
long-handled whip. On general prin-
ciples each horse blamed the other for
the whip; they swished their tails twice,
raised their heads a few degrees more
from the dusty road, the mare made a
feeble attempt to bite the gelding—the
feminine is always quicker at apportion-
ing blame —then settled back once more
into the easy rhythm of their £ace.
The Tralgan Hill was ahead. The
horses knew Tralgan Hill and regarded
its ascent as something a little more diffi-
cult and arduous than a passage over the
Andes. They ceased their jog a full
quarter of a mile before the hill started,
and went into a walk that clearly indi-
cated that their expectation of life was
founded on a most generous and exag-
gerated scale. The reins were dropped
on their rumps ; they were given a flip
with the whip—both very perfunctory—
but no notice was taken.
Then Greg said “You have a fine pair
of horses.”
The young fellow said “Aw, good
enough for this sort of thing.”
A hundred yards of road joined eter-
nity. Then: “How are father and
mother now?” Greg caressed the
“father” and “mother” with tones that
indicated what a poor world it would be
without fathers and mothers.
“The old man’s all right.” And, with
a mild trace of indignation. “By cripes
he doesffit belt me any more—like to see
him try it on now! ” Then he relapsed into
his calm and remembered he had only
answered half the question. “Mother’s
dead, you know. Died two years ago.”
Greg’s eyes filled slightly. “Oh, I am
so sorry to hear of it. So very, very
sorry. When the mother goes, what a
break it makes in the family circle!
You have my deepest sympathy.”
The young fellow was not visibly
affected by the sympathy. He flicked
and dropped the reins to intimate to the
horses that Tralgan Hill was now a
quarter of a mile behind them and, after
convincing themselves that they were not
being deceived in the matter, the horses
took up their jog again.
“Let me see, now,’ said Greg when
the sad departure of mothers had been
sufficiently contemplated. “You’d be
Alec, wouldn’t you?”
The young fellow looked up and
grinned. “You’re thinking of the Muirs,
aren’t you?”
Greg, as a matter of fact, wasn’t
really thinking of anyone, but he had
noticed the name on the van: “A. Wall,
Registered Milk Vendor, Grey Box.”
The “Alec” was just a tentative feeler.
The young fellow added “There ain’t no
Alec in our lot.”
“Yes, to be sure —I am forgetting. I
have been away for so long that I forget
many things. I have been around the
world since I last dear old Summer-
lea.” There were all the touching tones
of the exile on setting foot on his native
shore once again.
The young fellow was not over-im-
pressed—perhaps he visualised round the
world as a journey round a very big
paddock,
“I’m Greg. Don’t you know Greg?”
The young fellow didn’t. Greg was
not at all disconcerted. Whatever great-
ness was his, he was not vain about it.
He mentioned the saddlery in town. The
young fellow brightened a little. “Oh,
him ! Yes, we know him.”
After a long time the young fellow,
evidently after prodding his memory,
grinned and said “But I’ve heard of
you.” Greg was pleased.
“Ain’t you in the church, or something?”
“Not yet,” regretfully, “though that is
all my vocation.”
The cemetery appeared on the left —
yellow box and dark slim cypress pines
were the chief features. Locally it was
always called the “burying ground.”
Greg intimated that he would alight here.
The young fellow put his foot on the
brake, but the horses had already stopped.
The difference was hardly perceptible.
“Coin’ in there, are you?”
“Yes.” The tone was that of simple
and sacred duty.
“Well, I’m goin’ to keep out of that
buryin’ ground as long as I can.” TJiis
must have been humor, for the young
fellow gave a loud, mirthless neighing
sound. *Then, after surmounting the initial
difficulties, the young fellow drove off.
THAT afternooh, as the tall oaks were
already throwing long shadows
across the lucerne paddock, Greg ap-
peared at Emil Schneider’s.
He first encountered Annie, who was
picking some peaches from a tree near
the house. Annie was the youngest
Schneider girl. Very nice girl, Annie.
Greg greeted her as would a friend who
called every day or so. Annie smiled,
but looked puzzled.
“Don’t you know Greg?” That was
not reproof—just friendliness. But Annie
didn’t know Greg, so Greg explained,
and Annie gained a vague idea of his
identity.
No, Greg wouldn’t eat a peach. ‘Not
now. Later on he’d love to. He always
thought that peaches seemed too beautiful
altogether to eat. Foolish, perhaps, for
they were sent us for part of our daily
food. Annie hadn’t thought of it that
way before.
Greg helped to gather some peaches—
not very successfully, for Annie was only
picking ripe ones, and you mustn’t
squeeze them to find out.
Mrs. Schneider came out and called
Annie. And saw Greg. She knew Greg.
With a twinge at first, she wondered if
all that old Hare was saying could be
true. A second look at Greg brushed
such doubts aside. In any case, Mrs.
Schneider wasn’t Irish, and held no such
deep feeling about “spoiled priests.”
Greg was taken inside.
Quite incidentally it was learned that
Greg had been to the “burying ground.”
No need to mention why. His devotion to
his mother was as rare as it was beautiful.
Greg stayed for tea —under pressure he
half admitted he had eaten nothing all
day. Hadn’t thought of eating, really.
Emil was pleased in his own way to see
Greg, and Greg spoke in soothing gen-
eralities of the land and its products.
Besides, Emil was anxious to detail the
last row he had with Father Moran —
the biggest and best yet, over Church
finance. Greg didn’t condemn, however,
but let it be understood that certain
degrees of worldliness must of necessity
be found even in the priestly calling. It
was just our poor human nature after all.
Such of the boys and girls as were still
at home were pleased to see Greg, who
insisted (gently) on introducing himself
“to see if they remembered.” It invari-
ably went “Don’t you know Greg?” He
was firm in his yielding way about
“Greg.” Wouldn’t be called anything
else. Only the oldest remembered, and
then not very clearly.
For one so unworldly it was surprising
how much Greg ate. Not obviously, of
course. But in a smooth way food just
disappeared, without Greg seeming to eat
at all. And he talked all the time, or lis-
tened with earnest attention, and one
didn’t see him chewing.
After a meal that would have done
credit to a conscientious navvy, Greg re-
quested that he might offer up the thanks.
His “grace after” was really beautiful.
Greg noticed on the mantelpiece a well-
used copy of the Imitation of Christ. He
was delighted. “Ah, an old and dear friend
—Day Imitas-she-own-ay—! May I?”
He took the book, and though no one
quite knew how it happened he had the
family seated round, and himself reading
the piously reflective book. With suitable
commentary, too, that was as beautiful as
Thomas a Kempis himself.
Greg could read, there was no doubt
about that. And he kept it up till just be-
fore that point when his listeners might be
slightly inclined to weary. Then he put
the book back on the mantel. “What a
consolation that little book has brought
to a world of pain and sadness!”
It was getting late, and Greg wouldn't
hear of keeping the family up any longer.
He wouldn’t say where he was going, but
it was rather apparent that he had made
no arrangements for the night. No, he
couldn’t think of inconveniencing such
good people. It was too good of them
altogether. He mustn’t follow his inclina-
tions.
At last, however, he was persuaded to
stay. Of course it didn’t matter that he
had no clothes. Jim’s pyjamas would fit
him, and the spare room was always
ready. So Greg stayed.
On retiring, Emil with Siome diffidence
asked Greg did he, would he—take a
glass of wine. Greg did take wine—as
one of God’s gifts. This being a special
occasion he was pleased to take two
glasses of wine. There was nothing of
human weakness about it —that could be
seen by the way Greg took his wine,
GREG stayed the next day. And the
next. And for many days after that.
He put away very carefully his black suit,
and was pressed into wearing a suit of
Jim’s —quite a good fit too.
Mrs. Schneider and the girls soon felt
that a saint was in their midst, and the
boys felt there “was something in it.”
The Imitation became a regular institu-
tion.
Occasionally, too, Greg put bn his
black suit and went across the creek. He
never said —and no one asked—but it
was understood that he was visiting the
cemetery. On such evenings his voice
was, if possible, more tender in its blend-
ing of joy and sadness.
Sometimes he called, on his way back
from the cemetery, at Fred Rosen’s. He
liked Fred —indeed he liked all men —and
Fred would take him to the cellar, where
it was cool and the strong lights of day
were softened and toned so that they fell
gently on tired eyes. Greg would say
after such a sojourn at Fred’s that Fred
was a fine man, “although he is not one
of us.” One evening he said it six times
with a catch in his voice, which shows
how much he felt what he was saying.
Another evening he fell into the creek
while returning. Luckily it wasn’t a
cemetery day, so he was not wearing the
black suit, and only had Jim’s clothes.
It showed how dangerous that crossing
was, and Mrs. Schneider said that the
boys must put a few logs across and make
it safe.
AT times Greg visited neighbors —not
many of them, for Greg was, as he
often hinted, a shy man. But it is the shy
men who mostly have need of human
companionship, and their tragedy is that
they lack ability to cultivate it.
He was a welcome visitor at Mrs.
Doolan’s—Mrs. Jim, of course ; Dan and
his family were a godless lot. Mrs.
Doolan was fat and always perspiring,
but she would have hot scones and a
drop of tea on the table in less than no
time, and was always ready to listen and
be impressed.
Jim Doolan would come in for a cup,
and often say, “Isn’t that what I always
said?” and swill tea rather noisily and
devour scones —big scones they were, the
country type of scones, two and a halt
inches each way, and an inch and a half
thick. Jim would get his scone in two
bites. He wasn’t really “refined” at all,
but Mrs. Doolan could hardly notice
that, seeing the way she perspired.
And Greg never noticed, and spoke to
the children till they felt they were “little
children,” and truly blessed.
Then Greg would sigh, patting a young,
curly head at the same time, and contrast
the family happiness he saw about him

UNCABLED ADDITIONS
RUSSIANS AS VICTIMS.
(From a N.Y. “Times” letter by Eugene Lyons, author of “Assignment in Utopia ”
and “The Red Debacle.")
In observing foreign opinion on the
affairs of the Soviet Union for a good
many years, I have been struck by a
phenomenon so persistent that it might
reasonably be formulated as a law of
behavior; The greater the tolerance for
the Soviet, regime, the greater the con-
tempt for the Soviet people.
It is obviously difficult, if not impos-
sible, to be “friendly” toward a dictator-
ship and its subjects at the same time.
The Soviet boosters accomplish this feat
by convincing themselves that the subjects
in this case are a despicable lot who
neither know nor care about political
liberties and actually like being terrorised.
Thus it happens that fervid “friendship”
for Soviet Russia in the official Moscow-
sponsored sense has become equivalent to
derogation of the Soviet population and
high-minded approval of their martyrdom
as noble “sacrifices” imposed on a sub-
human species by its superhuman masters.
That contempt is often unconscious
and merely implicit. It shows up in the
familiar assertion that Bolshevism, though
self - evidently unacceptable to us, is
neatly suited to the Russians. It is
manifest in the generous readiness of self-
styled “friends of the Soviet Union” to
sacrifice any number of millions of Rus-
sians, as if they were less than guinea
pigs, in the interests of the Great Experi-
ment over there.
But a lot of the contempt is explicit
enough. We find it in most of the “pro-
Soviet” books by foreigners. One of them,
some years ago, asserted that Stalin’s
ruthless methods “were most fitted to the
Russian character and folkways in that
they established Asiatic absolutism.” An-
other assured us that “without an iron-
bound dictatorship Russia could not sur-
vive, for it is the only thing the Russian
people know and understand,” A third,
quite recently, developed at length the
thesis that Russians have neither a
“genuine understanding” of nor a “desire”
for freedom, and no interest at all in civil
or political rights.
The assumption is that Russians and
other Soviet populations have no bother-
some appetites for liberty and can be
managed only with whips, concentration
camps and execution squads. Such
methods might be hard on the refined
sensibilities of other peoples, but they are
relished, or at any rate not resented, by
the strangely masochistic Russians.
The cream of the cruel jest is that those
who hold such insulting opinions of the
Russians consider themselves honestly,
even with a touch of exaltation, authentic
friends of Russia. And that by definition
makes them Liberals and Progressives, as
distinguished from reactionaries and
crypto-Fascists who suppose that Russians
not only deserve freedom but would
recognise the thing and could take it with-
out ill-effects.
Presumably Soviet citizens, including
the fifteen million or so in forced-labor
colonies and isolators, enjoy the terror
under which they exist and have no desire
to eliminate it. Presumably they are con-
tent with prescribed thoughts, political
liquidations, blood purges, mass de-
portations, the hostage system, universal
mutual espionage, punishment without
open trial, regimented education, coerced
collectivisation and the rest of the totali-
tarian blessings. These friends who chal-
lenge us to “understand Russia” appar-
ently regard a broad-minded acceptance
of the bizarre Russian liking for enslave-
ment as basic to that understanding.
Unhappily the Russians themselves,
possessing no civil rights, lack also the
right to refute such libels on their national
character.
Anyone acquainted with Russian his-
tory must be aware of the passion with
which thousands of Russians fought and
died for personal liberties. Russian litera-
ture, from Pushkin to Gorki, provides
endless proofs of the intense Russian
desire for political rights, as well as for
freedom in other dimensions. The cir-
cumstance that Russia today has ten
times as many political prisoners as the
rest of the world put together indicates
the ruthlessness of the dictatorship—but
also the obduracy of Russians in resisting
ruthlessness.
The current foreign policies of the
Kremlin, its treatment of conquered and
liberated populations, the newly “tough”
party line of our domestic Communists
and other factors are rapidly swinging
opinion against Russia. It would be
tragically unfair and politically disastrous
if that opinion failed to make a clear-
headed distinction between the Soviet
regime and the Russian people. The
alleged “friends” whose friendship rests
on contempt are doing a terrible dis-
service. In effect they are loading the
people of the U.S.S.R. with responsibility
foe a system and policies of which they
are not the authors but the victims.
The more carefully and
we differentiate between the Kremlin
rulers and the Russian ruled, the more
chance there will be for a rapprochement
of the peoples of the world over the heads
of their power politicians.
FAIR TRIAL v. PRESS TRIAL.
(London “Times” letter written by Lieut.-Col. Anthony Marlowe, M.P., on his return
from acting as Judge-advocate at military courts which tried German war criminals.)
Among the cases which came before
my court was that concerning the burn-
ing of four women. This case attracted
considerable British press comment and
unfavorable opinion was expressed of the
fact that of the nine Germans accused
only one was sentenced to death. It
appeared to be suggested, on some eye for
eye principle, that either the gravity of the
charge or the number of the victims
demanded more executions. It is import-
ant that it should be understood that
British justice is not administered in this
way. The press demand for more heads
was no doubt actuated by a lurid story
that these women were put alive into a
burning oven, screaming and kicking to
the last.
This story came from a Pole, and had
there been any truth in it the press com-
ment would have been merited. But the
very purpose of the court was to investi-
gate the truth, which it did very thor-
oughly. The Pole emerged as the most
unreliable witness I have ever seen in any
court. It transpired that he had not been
there, knew nothing about it, and was
merely drawing on his imagination. The
simple facts proved to the satisfaction of
the .court were that these women were
put to death and subsequently cremated.
The only issue before the court was
whether the unfortunate women had
suffered “judicial execution” after trial
and sentence as spies or not. The court
being satisfied that there had been no
trial or sentence, the executioner or
executioners could be condemned for
murder.
The evidence was clear that some four
people were the executioners. Only one
of these was before the court; he was
duly condemned to death. Of the others,
one had committed suicide and the
other two had not been apprehended.
The remaining accused were proved only
to have played minor roles of complicity
and (except for thtee who hadtlearly not
been implicated and were therefore ac-
quitted) were sentenced to long terms of
imprisonment.
It would be impossible to imagine a
clearer vindication of the purpose of
these trials. If these accused had been
dealt with on rumor, mob law or by a
press campaign great injustice would have
been done. In the event, the German
defence counsel and the German public
have been deeply impressed by witness-
ing an administration of justice which
had been unknown in their country for
13 years, and in consequence they quite
clearly recognise that Britain is the fount
of justice. When, the following day, the
same court sentenced to death on a
clearly proved charge of murdering a
British airman three of the men who had
escaped the death penalty in the “four
women” case they manifested their agree-
ment and approval of the sentences.
The difficult task of administering
British justice in a foreign country is being
carried out with conspicuous success;
great harm will be done if it is to be
subject to pressure and to adverse com-
ment from the press.
WESTERN DEMOCRATIC BLOC.
(Condensed from an “American Mercury” article by Norman Angell.)
We must strive to make U.N.O. work,
but at the same time we must know it
for what it is—a none-too-perfect mech-
anism which provides a framework for
collaboration but not a guarantee of it.
If we are to act upon this awareness,
we must seek additional ways of strength-
ening the bonds between nations. One
such way seems to be the establishment of
a Western democratic bloc—as a means
of supplementing U.N.0., not of sup-
planting it; as a foundation for it, not
an alternative to it.
Peace does not constitute the only
objective. Not peace at any price, but
peace with freedom is the goal of the
democracies. U.N.O. is a functional
security organisation designed to keep the
peace and nothing more. Even in
this role it is badly handicapped
by the self-protective veto power of each
of the Big Five. If freedom is to weigh
in the balance, it must have a set of
scales which it can tip more easily than
iTisjn mpptinps
those at 1U.N.0. -
Two broad areas of friction exist to
day, one troublesome the other poten-
tially explosive The first is; among the
democracies, the United States Great
Britain, France t^ e h sr^^. 1
Western Europe. Each has its own petty
jealousies and antagonisms toward the
others, stemming from divergent ™P e ™ al
considerations, economic
varying political tendencies. The second
is between the democracies on the one
hand and the Soviet Union and its satel-
htes on the other.
A Western bloc admittedly would chaw
the democracies closer together and
mitigate the discord between them. But,
its critics claim, such a development
would alienate Russia, dividing mankind
into two rival aggregates of power des-
tined for war. I suggest that the opposite
would occur,
Once before America and Britain were
offered membership in a Western bloc,
At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919
Clemenceau pleaded with Wilson and
Lloyd George in terms which ran some-
thing like this: —
You English-speaking nations have just
fought a war on French soil, and left the
bones of your sons there, because you both
discovered, somewhat late, that the security
of France is indispensable to your own.
If you want to avoid being dragged into a
second world war, promise me that if
France is attacked hereafter you will de-
fend her. If you both make that pledge
loudly enough for Germany to hear, she
will never dare to fight, for the German
General Staff won’t gamble on your neu-
trality. If you don’t say it, will have
;ake B a^hSe m ™y?ur , ™uSfS a " Sr
Wilson speaks of the League. It does not
yet exist. It may never exist; or it may
{to thSe'VufS
to insure the integrity of France and the
peace of the world.
Both Wilson and Lloyd George were
deeply convinced. Both agreed to a tri-
partite treaty of guarantee. Neither
could convince his people ; the treaty was
never ratified. France and England
drifted steadily apart, while America re-
tired into its shell. And, exactly as
Clemenceau had predicted, a second war
broke over all of them, largely for the
very reasons which he had foreseen.
The tripartite treaty, if ratified, would,
not have militated against the success of
the League of Nations. Indeed, it would
have given the League such a nucleus of
united power as its quarrelling factions
never achieved otherwise. Threatened
with dangers which a disunited League
could not avert, France had to resort to
the unilateral measures of security which
remained to her—huge reparation de-
mands on Germany, a shaky system of
alliances m Eastern Europe, and similar
str °£S-arm measures. ,
Thus the fafiure of the Westem de
racies to join hands in 1919 was doubly
disastrous. Two of the democracies by
refusing to commit themselves to a per-
manent partnership gave resurgen Ger-
many the chance to make her bid for
power, and at the same time unleashed
fhe third on a course of action which led
, mllame in 1940
s " t g at Great Britain and France
PP ahead the treaty of guar .
£ar]y twenties despite the
defection of the United States, and had
dfawn the combination their lesser
neighbors Belgium, Holland, the Scan-
dinavian countries. Would this have in-
cr£ased American mis givings of the
L or bave alienated America
from co . operation in a world
order? Q uite tbe con trary. It would
have diminished those misgivings. What
d j SbJrbed Americans was not the prospect
of a united Europe, but the utter in-
capacity of Europe to unite at all. Had
Europe been united and comparable
Jn power to tbe United States, the latter
would in ad probab ility have eventually
en j ered j be League and made common
cause. But instead of involving them-
seives j n obscure quarrels which they
could not even understand, Americans
cbose to go their own way, taking their
own measures of security.
j s Russia’s present feeling toward the
Western democracies likely to be very
different? Flushed with enormous
triumph, Russia finds herself suddenly be-
come the greatest military power on
porth P’or a nn&rtcr of a, ccnturv the

Russian people have been educated to a
messianic belief in their country: spear-

system. Every conflict that arises be-

Russians all the more that little security
can be expected in co-operation With the
West.

cision, public discussion, and so forth.
Of all these principles the Soviet Union
is frankly sceptical; few of them does
it apply at home.
The first job of the Western democra-
cies, therefore, is to demonstrate that
they can make their principles work in
their relations with one another. We
must dispel the suspicion that Britain’s
very moderate Parliamentary Socialism
precludes her close and amicable associa-
tion with the United States. Until the
free lands of the West can manifest their
essential unity, Russia has little reason
to trust her security to their kind of
international organisation or to pay much
regard to their views. Instead, the Soviets
will be tempted to adhere to the older
pattern of statecraft by which their
domains have grown from a small duchy
into the greatest territorial empire in the
world.
Throughout history the States of the
West have shown a tragic reluctance to
combine except under the pressure of
dire emergencies, and then it was too
late. America’s persistence throughout
the opening years of two world wars in
the delusion that totalitarian power
could never touch her eventually exposed
her to a war effort far more exhausting
than prompter participation would have
required. Norway, Belgium and other
States, on the very eve of invasion, re-
fused to admit British or French troops
within their borders until the German
armies had actually crossed them. This
made Europe a Christmas present to the
German General Staff.
Today there is no defence in distance,
but only in co-operation. Once more an
indulgent history offers us the opportunity
of a Western bloc. If we reject it again,
we are discarding our most powerful
means of protection as we pick our way
into an age darkened by the shadow of
the broken atom.
U.S. Reaction Against Strikes.
(The rise in anti-strike, and hence anti-Labor,
feeling in America —also growing in Australia —
as seen by Vermont Royster in “Wall-street
Journal.")
The pendulum of Labor’s clock is in
full swing, but from Labor’s viewpoint
it is swinging in the wrong direction.
Never before has U.S. Labor possessed so
much actual power over the state of the
nation, as is easily demonstrable, but
there is a growing feeling in Congress,
both among friends and foes, that the
prolonged series of strikes has given
the Labor movement a hurt from which
it will not easily recover.
Thus far the anti-Labor actions under-
taken by Congress have not been too
onerous, because they have been hap-
hazard in conception and slipshod in
construction. Nonetheless, they are indi-
cative of the swing of the pendulum.
So far in the current session the so-
called anti-Petrillo bill has been passed,
the Case bill was checked only by the
concentration against it of all available
forces, and a House sub-committee has
begun hearings on the Robertson-Smith
bills to outlaw the collection of union
“royalties” levies.
On the other side of Capitol Hill,
Senator Byrd has announced his intention
of introducing a companion measure to
the Robertson-Smith bills. Another bill
to ban strike violence and secondary
boycotts and to make unions subject to
suit for breach of contract is being ad-
vanced by a bloc headed by Senators Ball
and Taft. This bill would also provide
for a compulsory 60-day cooling off
period before strikes are called.
A Senate Labor committee has ap-
proved a bill to ban interference with the
transportation of perishable goods. Most
recently Senator Lucas has proposed to
make it a criminal act to interfere with
the operation of public services, such as
the railroads and the utilities.
Even more significant than these piece-
meal attempts at legislation is the fact that
more and more Congressmen are ventur-
ing to speak out against the Labor
leaders. The reasons behind this rum-
bling of revolt in Congress against the
10-year domination of Labor are not
difficult to find. The Congressmen are
convinced that for once the people them-
selves are growing weary of the strikes
that have come in an unending stream.
French Fears of Germany.
(From a report by the Chicago [?] staff
correspondent in Germany.)
French foreign policy rests on three
deeply-rooted fears:
1. —Fear of Germany. Germany has
overrun France three times in three
generations. After each conquest France
faced the future in a relatively weaker
position than before.
The Potsdam declaration did not de-
prive Germany of its war-making
potential just by giving Silesia to Poland.
It left the, Ruhr, the Rhineland and the
Saar, with their great war potential, in
the west. No Frenchman sleeps peace-
fully while Germany controls such a
mighty potential.
2. —Fear of Communism. Conserva-
tive Frenchmen look on all Communists,

PROGRESS TOWARDS PERMANENT PEACE.
including French Communists, as instru-
ments of the Soviet Union.
They are willing to admit that every
country in Europe is moving toward
some form of collective society, 'Hieir
hope lies in the eventual formation of an
anti-Communist front at home and
abroad against Communist domination of
future collectivist Governments.
3. —Fear of a unified “Red Germany.”
Among themselves, many Frenchmen ad-
mit that the Soviet Union has seized the
initiative in the organisation of Ger-
many.
They believe that any central Govern-
ment or administration that might be
formed in Germany now would be
quickly dominated by the Communists,
even though a majority of Germans might
vote otherwise.
A strong central Government in
Berlin, dominated by Communists, would
constitute a terrible menace to France,
particularly if that Government con-
trolled the Ruhr, the Rhineland and the
Saar-

The Swiss people are hesitant about joining
U.N.O. because the principle of collective
security would require them to abandon their
traditional neutrality, which has brought then*
safely through two world wars. Switzerland,
were she not neutral, might expect to feel the
impact of an early blow in any new conflict.
In Europe, the small neutral nations have had
the best of it, as any visitor to Eire, Portugal
or Switzerland can easily see for himselt. it
they all get mixed up next time there will be
no sanctuaries left for anyone. This the Swiss
see plainly, and U.N.O. has not got off to a
good enough start to allay their fears. But
they freely admit that one thing wrong with the
League of Nations was that less than the whole
world was in it. America was not in and the
Germans walked out. Opinion in Switzerland,
therefore, is that the problem of the future is
not to bring into U.N.O. more little nations,
who have no real need to be there, but to keep
in all the big Powers and get them to work
together in harmony. Switzerland is as wor-
ried as any other country over the lack
of harmony with Russia. — N.Y. “Sun” staff

American interest in the Anglo-Egyptian ne-
gotiations is the preservation of the British
Empire lifeline through the Mediterranean Sea.
This was part of America’s own strategic line
during the war, and would be so again.
Theoretically, the evacuation of British forces
south of the Suez Canal and the abandonment
of near-by naval bases might seem to weaken
the defence of this vital water lane. That was
the contention of the Conservative Opposition
in the British Parliament, and some of the
Dominions view the proposal with misgivings.
But matters may work out the other way. A
sullen, resentful and openly rebellious Egypt
would make an unstable base for British mili-
tary operations. Moreover, the Canal may
prove equally defensible from bases in Palestine,
Trans-Jordan and Saudi Arabia. By frankly
recognising the rising tide of Egyptian national-
ism, Britain is likely to obtain a much more
favorable arrangement for joint defence in
time of war, the only time it really matters,
than the Egyptians would otherwise have
accepted. The British offer is not quite so
broad as it appears on the surface. The
evacuation may take five years. But at least
Egypt comes to the parleys as a free agent
and a full partner. Arabs everywhere will note
and ponder this improved status of one of the
chief members of the Arab League. Britain
must maintain troops somewhere in the Near
East, and not too far from the Canal. Her
friendly approach to Egypt should make it
easier for her to deal with other Arab States.

A new upsurge in crime is gaining headway
rapidly in the U.S. The 1945 crime increase
of 12.3 per cent., biggest in history, is being
nearly doubled in 1946. More than 1,565,500
major crimes were reported by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in 1945. Every day,
on the average, 4289 major crimes were com-
mitted. In the average 24 hours, 226 persons
were killed, assaulted or raped; 149 persons
were robbed, 662 cars were stolen, 881 places
were burglarised and 2371 thefts were com-
mitted. — “United Stales News.’’

A series of protests has been made to Russia
by the United States against the spread of barter
arrangements and Russian control over neigh-
boring economies in Eastern Europe. The
prospect of large-scale American credits to the
Soviet Union, which as long as two years ago
seemed reasonable and likely, has apparently
been eclipsed by the impossibility of reaching
an accommodation between Russian and Ameri-
can views on the future organisation of this
region of Europe. The proposed American loan
to Poland has gone into cold storage until
free elections have been held. — London “Times”

Poles, like Irishmen, have long memories.
They do not quickly forget their long and
cruel subjection to the Russian Tsars. Today,
moreover, the U.S.S.R. is taken to mean Com-

stubborn anti-Russian feeling among the
people, apart from the small middle class
and dispossessed aristocracy, comes from the
peasant. And this is less due to history than
to the peasant’s inborn fear of Communism.
Like all peasants, the Pole is possessive and
fanatically attached to his own piece of land.
Consequently Russia’s influence and proximity
arouse in him the constant fear that the land
wijl be nationalised and he himself will be made
to work on a collective farm. — Manchester

Russia would not lift a finger to oust Franco
if it meant that a constitutional monarchy,
like Britain’s, or a system of free enterprise,
like America’s, would follow. When the Rus-

that a new civil war might not be a bad thing
for Spain, he was speaking by the book.

Those who explain Russian expansion by
demonstrating her need for security refuse
the sequence of cause and effect. The security
of her Empire, as Russia conceives it, is the
consequence, not the cause, of her expansion.
But security diminishes with expansion because
frontiers and lines of communication grow
larger and more exposed, because areas of in-
ternal discontent increase, so that insecurity
is engendered within the Imperial confines, and
because the security of other Empires is chal-
lenged. A dilemma is created, a dilemma of
increasing intractability—evergrowing insecurity
must be counteracted by constantly augmented
precautions, including the progressive seizure of
new territories, and the intensified challenge to
the security of others. The need for security
becomes yet another reason for further ex-
pansion.—London “Nineteenth Century and
After. 1 ’

We have to worry about power shortages, when miners’

THE LIBERAL PARTY believes in the principle that
wages should be the highest and conditions the best

that good work is the essential condition of good pay.
The Party will conduct a constant educational cam-

MR. CALWELL CHIPS IN.
Australia’s troubles look bad to Aus-
tralians and are admittedly hard to en-
dure, especially by those who have been
denied the full employment and houses so
effusively promised. But they were all
preventable and are all remediable by
internal action. They all proceed from
the blindness and weakness of the “Gov-
ernment” which still claims to have Saved
the Country, while objecting to having the
claim put to the test by inquiries into the
tragedies of Rabaul, Ambon, Java, Singa-
pore and Timor, and the R.A.A.F. mal-
administration on which Air Vice-
Marshal Bostock has been writing with
most embarrassing knowledge and candor.
One of this crowd’s country-saving
measures was to keep a fine army un-
employed in Westralia for years after all
danger of an invasion of that State* had
ceased, at the same time paying West-
ralian farmers, who alone had a run of
fairly good seasons, huge sums for not
growing wheat. This blindness has been
exhibited in almost everything it has done
or failed to do in the way of post-war
reconstruction, as a multitude of wage-
payers and a greater multitude of wage-
earners can ruefully testify.
With weakness added to blindness, in-
dustry lags and great opportunities in
the domain of export trade are being lost,
perhaps permanently, as a result of the
tolerated excesses of Communists and their
mobs. These fellows could have been
reduced to insignificance by the stern en-
foi cement of Commonwealth law and
national security regulations, but since
Labor came in there has never been more
than a parody of enforcement, and even
the parody was long since dropped.
Fearing nothing from their “Labor”
referendum allies, and bringing the
methods of the old larrikin “pushes”
into the control of trade-unionism.
Communists and their mobs have
proceeded from outrage to outrage,
with consequences evil to industry, com-
merce apd housing and degrading as
well to foreign policy, having embroiled
White Australia with its friendly neigh-
bors the Dutch. Thousands of poor
people who have survived the savagery of
“our Indernesian comrades” are still held
in internment camps. And all these out-
rages have gone unchecked, the guilty
parties even unreproved, by the “Govern-
ment,” though the defence power under
, Inch the “Government” could do almost
anything, “except make a man a woman
or a woman a man,” still rests in its
palsied hands.
In circumstances far worse, because
their country was exposed to the full
force of Nazi barbarism, save only in-
vasion by land, the British are making
a splendid industrial revival. It has not
been helped by socialistic schemes and
threats, and it is out of the question for
the export trade and the maritime and
aerial services to have been fully estab-
lished in so short a period, with Europe
still in ruins and unpacified and unrest
and murder gangs still part of the Asiatic
scene ; but what has been accomplished
is rather wonderful. And British Labor
has made short work of the Russian party,
not only rejecting its last “affiliation”
manoeuvres but interdicting them for all
time. And while our wandering External
Affairs Minister has permitted the local
Russian party to make a mockery of his
foreign policy as it concerns the Dutch
(he Still gets away with his strong-man pose
abroad) the British Foreign Secretary has
stood up to Moscow at every point. Mr.
Bevin can fairly claim to have halted the
Russian advance to the Mediterranean
and Persian Gulf, while standing four-
square against the Communisation of
Europe
Britain’s troubles remain serious, and
may become more serious still, but they
cannot be imputed to blindness and
poltroonery on the part of the Attlee
Government or, of course, of the Chur-
chill Government. If there has been
weakness in high places, it is a noble
weakness, which has raised the already
high credit of the nation: the sacrifice of
food supplies, necessitating even the ration-
ing of bread and flour, to prevent starva-
tion on a vast scale among Austrians,
Germans, Poles and Yugoslavs—whose
Government, being Communist, is bitterly
anti-British, By halting the expulsion of
Germans from Poland and Czechoslo-
vakia into the British zone, and by shar-
ing with its neighbors, Russia could have
spared its faithful war partner this sacri-
fice. Moscow preferred to send half a
million tons of wheat to France as a pre-
referendum and -election gesture (rejected
by the majority of the French people),
while drawing on U.N.R.R.A. stocks for
the Ukraine and White Russian “repub-
lics”' and backing the inordinate claims of
the Yugoslav and Czech Governments.
Gratitude is the rarest of human vir-
tues, and from improvised States like
Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, already
prey to tribal and ideological animosities
which may wreck them, the English, wise
in the ways of European peoples, probably
don’t expect it. But they might reasonably
look for at least a modicum of gratitude
from Jews, for whom they found a
national home in Palestine, with protec-
tion during the period when cities and
settlements were established’ and whose
cause they championed in 1939 when the
U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A., with respec-
tively four times and three times
their population, stood aloof. But
the Palestine Jews and their sup-
porters and financiers in other coun-
tries, fulfilling the fears of one of the
wisest men of their race, our own Isaac
Isaacs, have chosen to treat the British as
enemies as hateful as Hitler’s Germans.
And the Jewish terrorists, after murdering
Lord Moyne and his Tommy driver, try-
ing to murder or capture the outgoing
British High Commissioner in Palestine,
kidnapping and chaining British officers,
blowing up bridges and committing many
other criminal acts, at last baited the
British into taking repressive measures.
These measures were carried out methodi-
cally and humanely and were justified by
the discovery of a score of secret dumps
of arms and explosives.
There is a Left-wing Jewish element in
the British Labor party, and a Mr, Silver-
man shouted in the Commons that
the Attlee Government’s proceedings
amounted to “plain and paked war —war
on the Jewish national home.” The Prime
Minister replied that his Government was
“trying to deal fairly with the Jews and
Arabs” —the population of Palestine is
two-thirds Arab and one-third Jew —and
that “no Government worthy of the
name” would “yield to the kind of
violence which has occurred in Palestine.”
There followed in New York demonstra-
tions of hostility to the British Govern-
ment and the Union Jack which would
have been the subject of diplomatic pro-
tests had they been aimed at Nazi Ger-
many at any period before September,
1939. Governor Dewey lent his voice to
the agitation, and President Truman said
that “the arrest of Jews alleged to be
terrorists” had “not affected” his “deter-
mination to push forward without delay
the policy of transferring 100,000 more
Jews to Palestine.” This may mean no
more than that elections of Congressmen
and State Governors are due in four
months, and that Mr. Dewey and Mr.
Truman have a lively sense of the impor-
tance of the Jewish vote.
But our Mr. Calwell, who three months
ago was dreadfully indignant at the
arrival in Australia of a radio man, his
wife and two children (“these English
people”!) couldn’t resist the tempta-
tion to chip in. Addressing a
Jewish meeting in Sydney he “ex-
pressed the hope that distinguished
Jews reported to have been arrested
in Palestine” would “soon be set free.”
And he recalled with self-satisfaction
that his Department of Immigration,
“assisted by the loan of typewriters and
typists from the Australian Council of
Jewry,” had rushed through “2000 landing
permits for relatives of Jews at present in
Australia”—country or countries of
origin and political complexion of the
2000 unstated. The gentleman seemed
quite gleeful about it. He will laugh on
the other side of his mouth if —as is now
all too probable —the American Zionists
terrorise Congressmen into rejecting the
loan to Britain, from which Australia
would benefit materially, just as it will
suffer materially if the loan is rejected.
The Divided Diggers.
If there had been a carefully thought
out and executed plot to divide into two
camps afterwards those who served Aus-
tralia in uniform in the late war, it could
not have succeeded better than what has
actually happened. Apart from small
groups banded together by special bonds,
there are how two main organisations,
the original R.S.L. and the new Legion.
Both, for the present, aim at much the
same objective and serve much the same
general purpose—and a good one, too—
but each carries on under the figurative
banner “Absolutely No Connection With
the Show Across the Street.”
Dating from the earlier war—and doing
a grand single-handed job in every respect
between the wars—the R.S.L. preserved
one great limiting condition of mem*
bership. It was restricted to returned
men, who, moreover, had to be volunteers.
That was well enough in the earlier war,
when all but a handful of those who
wore the uniform served as volunteers
overseas. It was —and remains—an an-
achronism in regard to the later war, for
the Pacific part of which Australia was a
main base.
That meant that a very large number
of servicemen had no opportunity for
serving aboard. Most of them would
have preferred such service, and many
were volunteers, A.I.F. or R.A.A.F. The
“returned” clause in the R.S.L. member-
ship conditions shut them out, and still
shuts them out. The League belatedly
decided to admit called-up militia who
had done their bit in the overseas
area the Government had restricted them
to and in other specified areas. That was
no more than the least that could logically
have been done, both because the
militia involved had fought well and were
qualified as “returned,” and because be-
tween the wars the R.S.L. was the only
public organisation in Australia fighting
for sound defence, and particularly for
compulsory service training. Also, Aus-
tralia came close enough to being in-
vaded, and had that happened “returned”
would have lost all meaning.
Numbers of R.S.L. members are still in
favor of restricting the organisation to
returned volunteers. That, of course, is
wholly the affair of the R.S.L., but it
is, and has been, a potent factor in build-
ing up the big rival organisation.
From time to time moves have been
made to extend the R.S.L. membership
qualification to take in also all who volun-
teered, and further is to be heard of that
later this year, with increased representa-
tion in its favor, especially from Queens-
land. Such moves, however, are prob-
ably now too late, and in any case cannot
alter the fact that the R.S.L. itself helped
considerably to make the division of ex-
servicemen not only possible but certain.
Political assistance towards that same
end was peculiar and has not been ex-
plained. For a good part of the war all
those who had enlisted for the A.1.F., but
did not get away, as well as those who
sought to enlist in it, were issued with
recognition badges. Suddenly a stop was
put to this, and, together with the non-
issue of any form of service badge to
others discharged after being in uniform
in Australia, it meant that there were a
great many who —again because the
R.S.L. refused them—had nothing to
show for their service. Pretty well every
one of them naturally wanted something
to show, and the Legion was open to all.
Also, by what some may accept as a
striking coincidence, the organisation
starting up to rival the R.S.L. was offici-
ally permitted to adopt a badge almost
exactly identical in shape with the recent
war’s returned men’s badge. The ba'dge
of the body from which the Legion grew
was originally an entirely different
one; not a close copy in shape, but one
not at all resembling the returned man’s
badge. Today, with the change thus
curiously permitted, it would be safe
enough to bet that, despite the enamel
coloring, nine average civilians out of
ten accept that the Legion badge means
returned soldier. It also means, however,
that the wearer is a member of an organ-
isation rivalling the R.S.L. in size, doing
a great deal of practical work for' ex-
servicemen, and getting results.
Among other things, the Legion runs to
a co-operative building society which will
make advances up to £1540 ; it has a busi-
ness advisory panel to protect members
from “sharks” and shysters ; it has bought
a building in Sydney for £70,000 to be
N.S.W. and Federal headquarters; its
employment bureau claims to have already
placed 8000 ex-servicemen in suitable
employment this year ; and there are sub-
branches in all States.
In the practical business plf getting
things done at once for those who wore
the uniform —most of them for years and
many of them as volunteers —this can be
rated all to the good. When it comes to
practical business, opposition remains the
best of spurs, and in this respect the
R.S.L. is probably a better organisation
because the other is there. While League
and Legion work for the same good
objectives, the ex-serviceman’s lot should
be all the better for it.
And in one important respect—so far,
at least —the hopes of those who wanted
to see the ex-servicemen thus divided
have been disappointed. All along the
R.S.L. has sensibly stood out against be-
coming a party political organisation, and
the Legion also, is constituted as non-
political. If that continues to hold good,
the two organisations would seem to have
so much else in common in their objectives
that they could well throw their forces
together on vital issues. Meanwhile they
are separate, with the possibility always
there of a widening of the breach between
them, and with the present certainty also
that, thus divided, the ex-servicemen of
the two shows have not half the strength
which, undivided, they could exert in their
own and Australia’s interests.
Dreamers and Dreams.
It must be a melancholy experience for
old N.S.W. Labor men to dig up plat-
forms fashioned in the days when the
party was still young and had not lost
its ideals or its enthusiasm. The one put
together in 1909 left the faithful in no
doubt as to the main Objective:
The cultivation of an Australian senti-
ment based upon the maintenance of racial
purity and the development in Australia of
an enlightened and self-reliant community.
There followed the Fighting Platform;
first plank. Constitutional Reform.
(a) Abolition of the Legislative Council
and the substitution therefor of the Initia-
tive and Referendum.
( b ) Abolition of the office of State Gov-
ernor and other unnecessary offices.
No. 2 was Land and Financial Reform.
Land Reform was to be consummated
by, among many other things, “the imme-
diate cessation of Crown land sales”;
Financial Reform by “cessation of
borrowing” except for “(a) redemp-
tion, cih) completing works already
authorised by Parliament, and (c) under-
takings which will pay interest from the
beginning and provide 1 p.c. sinking
fund.”
No “Labors undertaking has ever paid
interest from the beginning, much less
provided “1 p.c. sinking fund.” With
no known exception they have drawn
heavily on the tax-fund. This was
the case even in the war years, when the
N.S.W. Government railways (but not
those of South Australia, Westralia or
Tasmania) were making apparent profits
which came out of the Commonwealth
Treasury.
That 1909 platform is too long to be
quoted in full, but these planks should
not be omitted:
Amalgamation of existing Savings Banks
into a State bank.
A Right to Work Bill.
Absorption, of the unemployed by the
establishment of State ironworks, State
farms and labor colonies, State woollen
mills and clothing factories.
All iron required for State use to be pro-
duced from State mines.
State mills for sugar, grain and other
produce..
Liquor traffic reform; (a) State option,
with right to vote as to compensation; ( b )
plebiscite of electors as to nationalising
the liquor traffic.
Nationalisation of any industry which
becomes a private monopoly.
Nationalisation of land.
Nationalisation of coalmines.
Of this catalogue of dreams nothing
remains but abolition of the Legislative
Council and nationalisation of State coal-
mines, and no one is less keen on that
than Mr. Chifley, since Coalcliff under
“control” managed to lose £60,000 in two
years, with a great increase in stoppages
and absenteeism. In the time of the last
“Labor” Government the Savings Banks
which were to be amalgamated went
bung. The State ironworks, ironmines
and the rest wouldn’t be undertaken even
if Thornton delivered an ultimatum.
From 1920 onwards it has never
occurred to any “Labor” Government to
lease city or country-town building land
still owned by the Crown. Labor
Governments have, on the contrary,
sold hundreds of acres to the high-
est bidders. Nor did Mr. McKell
and Mr. Tully require conversion to lease-
hold as a condition precedent to their
considerable investments as gentlemen
farmers in the Goulburn district. Land
nationalisation long since went down
the wind, and the recent Brewer and Bung
Bill was put through in contempt of State
option and nationalisation of the liquor
traffic. There is to be a liquor referendum,
but only on the question of bar-closing
hours, by way of passing the buck to the
electors, “Labor” being afraid to take
the responsibility itself.
Gone too are the Initiative and Refer-
endum as substitutes for the Legislative
Council, and “unnecessary offices” swarm.
The latest addition is a Ministry of
Tourist Activities and Immigration,
with! a costly department in the
making, though immigration is confined
to Mr. Cal well’s Jewish proteges, and if
tourists could be found there would be
little accommodation for them and less
transport. At the moment, after 2 p.m.
on Saturday there are not even Govern-
ment trams to take people to and from
places of amusement, or on Sunday to
take them to and from churches, hospitals
and cemeteries. And Premier McKell
has plumed himself publicly not on
abolishing “the office of State Governor,”
but on appointing to Government House
an Australian general—till recently one
of those brasshats —with a certain
massive increase in the cost of the
establishment. He said this was the dream
of his youth and the aspiration of his
riper years or something like that.
As for “the cultivation of an Australian
sentiment based upon the maintenance of
racial purity,” Communists, with “Labor’s”
connivance, spit on it, root and plant. And
for “the development in Australia of an
enlightened and self-reliant community”
there has been substituted the develop-
ment of a race of reckless lottery and
racecourse gamblers, with “Labor” fur-
nishing instruments and incitement.


PLAIN ENGLISH
"Labor" Prepares.
In quarter-page daily-paper advertise-
ments Federal “Labor” appeals to “think-
ing Australians” to “set aside party pre-
judice and return the Chifley Govern-
ment” so that the Chifleys may continue
to give Australians “the assurance of full
employment, the stability of national
economy, the consolidation of our over-
seas relations” and so forth.
The advertisement must be meant seri-
ously, but there are more laughs in it
than in most of the “comic strips” with
which it competes. “Assurance of full
employment” at a time when a petty dis-
pute in a bacon factory has thrown
myriads of Queenslanders out of work!
“Stability of national economy” at
a time when maladjusted malcontents
dictating to a few thousand coal-
miners hold all industry up to ransom,
when railways, light and power authori-
ties and other public utilities are com-
pelled by the same embittered tyrants
to run on a hand-to-mouth basis under
the constant threat of a complete break-
down, and when staggering taxation kills
alike the desire to work and the incentive
to expand business.
But the best—or at least the bitterest—
laugh in the piece is evoked by a bit in
which Ben and Bert boast of their efforts
towards “the consolidation of our over-
seas relations.” And this when the Dutch,
our friends ever since Australia was
colonised, have been thrown shabbily
aside in favor of “Indernesian com-
rades” at the behest of irresponsible larri-
kins obedient to orders from the Kremlin ;
when Dutch ships lie at Australian
wharves under a nine-months’-old ban,
acquiesced in by the “Government”;
when a crippled Dutch destroyer, after
two months of fruitless appeal for repairs,
limps away from what should be hospit-
able shores with recriminations from the
Prime Minister still echoing about her
damaged hull!
The advertisement is authorised (and
presumably paid for) by the A.L.P., and
concludes with an appeal for funds.
“Contributions will be appreciatively re-
ceived by the Campaign Trustees (J. B.
Chifley or H. V. Evatt, Ms.P.), Common-
wealth Offices, Sydney.” Ben will prob-
ably be in Canberra and Bert anywhere
but in Australia, but if anyone cares to
“set aside party prejudice” and send in
his five bob, there’ll no doubt be a public
servant there to sign the receipt.
To the extent that members of the
present “Government” have swallowed
their own propaganda and really believe
that they saved the country in war and
are therefore the ones best fitted to con-
tinue the salvation in peace, these
advertisements may perhaps be dismissed
as over-enthusiastic self-admiration. The
same excuse will not explain another
advertisement, also accompanied by an
appeal for funds to be sent to the Cam-
paign Trustees (J. B. Chifley or H. V.
Evatt, Ms.P.).
Spread over more than half a
page of Sydney “Truth” and dis-
gracefully repeated in Melbourne
“Herald,” the thing purported to be
a page from a confidential book of in-
structions issued to Liberal candidates —
the heading was “Hints and Notes for
Liberal Party Speakers.” Typical of the
points was this one: “Avoid attempts to
infer that the nation lacks confidence in
Labor Government’s financial policy.
(Overwhelming response to Government’s
Loan Appeals contradicts such infer-
ence.)”
Protesting against the advertisement,
Mr. Menzies described it as “the
most fraudulent ever put before
the people.” He gave an assur-
ance that it was “not a copy of any
page of any Liberal party speaker’s
notes” and argued that its publication
was a punishable offence. Campaign
Trustee Chifley was unmoved, though he
expressed surprise at the Opposition-
Leader’s concern and asserted that the
advertisement was addressed t,o the intelli-
gent section of the community. It
appeared in a “Truth” which de-
voted 14 pages of that particular issue
to sport—the advertisement appeared on
one of them—and 16 to Divorce and
Police Court reports. Mr. Calwell’s com-
ment was “Don’t be squeamish! ”
If the “fraudulent” advertisement is any
indication of the manner in which the
“Trustees” of “Labor” intend running
their campaign there will be no room for
squeamishness in the ranks of “Labor,”
but many of the “intelligent section of
the community” will be nauseated.
"Cossie" to’"TKe Boys."
Like mainland publications, the Hobart
“Mercury” has one of those political
writers who make no secret of their
friendly intimacy with and naive enthusi-
asm for Labor politicians. To the Hobart
gentleman, styled “Our Political Ob-
server,” the Premier is “Cossie,” and
“Cossie,” it seems, summoned “a meeting
of the Labor boys to discuss the legislative
programme for the coming session,” com-
mencing in August. “Our Political Ob-
server” prattled on: —-
I have heard it suggested that the main
discussion might centre around likely reper-
cussions of the Kirby report on forestry
and any action that might be taken
The “boys” are by no means happy. Many
wanted a Royal Commission when the
matter was first brought before Parlia-
ment, but the party leaders thought other-
wise. With the election fast approaching
it is recognised that the matter will be
“red-hot” propaganda stuff.
There were two Kirby reports. In the
first it was recorded that when A. G.
Ogilvie was Premier Mr. Arthur Gari-
baldi Newman, of Melbourne, and friends
were allowed to take up 5995 acres of so-
called “third-class land” on which there
was 50 million super, feet of timber —
from which the State, as it transpired,
could have derived £12,500 to £25,000
in royalties—for £2058, payable in instal-
ments. In the second it was set down that
D’Alton, when Labor Minister of Forests
— i.e., before he was sent to N.Z. as High
Commissioner —and two of his officers
had taken bribes. Mr. Kirby is a Judge
of the N.S.W. District Court. The proba-
bilities are that plain people will show
a live interest in his reports even if im-
portant “Labor” politicians and racing-
mad newspapers do not.
SPONSORED SESSION.
“Oi, oi, listeners —this is your compere, ‘Schnozzle’ Calwell. Maxie Falstein is
coming to the microphone to ask if anyvun vants to buy a [?]ishe vatch.”
Repairing the Damaged.
The girl with the bandaged head and
swollen thumb was accommodated with a
light for her cigarette. She blew out the
smoke and said “Fell down the steps
at ’ome. Hadda ’ave five stitches. They
cut me ’air, ’Owm I gonna get it waved?
Bet me boss is in a panic,” She brooded
a moment,, then added, with humorous
disgust. “If I’d any sense I’d ’a’ done it
at work an’ bin on compo. now. It”
She paused as an ambulance swung into
the hospital yard ; and the little group
watched the ambulance men open the
doors, half-withdraw a stretcher then
push it back again. One of them hurried
through the doorway marked “Casualties”
ano*with astonishing rapidity a doctor
and a priest appeared. The doctor looked
at the figure on the stretcher, nodded, and
the priest made a gesture at once sorrow-
ful and full of benediction. Then the
ambulance doors were closed and the
vehicle moved away.
By this time the winter sun was warm-
ing the courtyard, and by ambulance and
taxi, by private car and on foot, the
casualties of the city began to arrive.
Of all ages, sizes, creeds, circumstances
and color they came, suffering from all
forms of accidental injury—limping, on
crutches, on stretchers, helped or carried
by friends and relatives. Most of them
were silent; a few groaned ; some wept.
Silent was a foreign sailor who’d drunk
himself into unconsciousness; noisy was
a “plonk artist” who came babbling and
weaving down the ramp, waved his arms
wildly at everybody and was taken gently
by a strong young nurse and propelled
to a bunk to sleep it off.
Behind a counter a voluntary worker
dispensed tea and biscuits at absurdly
small prices. She greeted some of her
bandaged customers by name. “I call
’em my regulars,” she said. “Nothing
wrong with ’em. They come here almost
every day to drink tea, chat with each
other and anybody else who will chat.
It’s a sort of club. They do no harm,
really, and the poor old things get some-
thing out of it.”
Meantime the stream of injured ebbed
and flowed. Soft-voiced and fleet, the
nurses took them into cubicles where soft-
voiced and firm and mostly young doctors
took them in hand, soothed the pain and
fear and anxiety without fuss or hesi-
tancy, set broken or displaced bones,
stitched wounds, emptied poisoned
stomachs and cleared confused heads.
Some went back to the city and their
work; others stayed ; others went to
wards or to sick-beds of their own choos-
ing. Unknown and unseen, hidden in
some secret place of cathode rays and
shining instruments, medical specialists
of renown waited to treat the more seri-
ous cases. Nobody was asked to pay; it
is doubtful if any of those receiving treat-
ment wondered even momentarily whence
came the money for the great building,
the costly equipment, the training and
knowledge.
Here and there, ministers of religion
appeared and disappeared on their
spiritual work. In all the tragedy and
humor, the squalor and ideals, the human
strength and human weakness of a great
public hospital, there is a note of human
sympathy as strong and persistent as the
basses of an orchestra and there, too, rules
true religion. It is the last which makes
the hospital such a refuge for the afflicted,
for in pain and anxiety there is no better
antidote than the sympathy, tolerant
understanding and confidence of a hos-
pital staff. This is what should be remem-
bered by everybody who is asked to con-
tribute to hospital funds. From the
humble thrippence dropped in the collec-
tion box to the £lOOO cheque the money
buys more than any other money in the
world.
That is to say it did, under what Dr.
Herbert Schlink in a “S.M.H.” article
calls the “old order” of hospital finance,
whereby patients and public contributed
what they could and Governments made
up the balance. Under a new “Labor”
order furtively introduced on July 1, “at
last bureaucracy,” as Dr. Schlink puts it,
“has attained its ends.”
Charity and voluntary effort are
slaughtered. Power politics and patronage
are supreme... .The new order will cost
much more because ultimately all volun-
tary charitable workers will be replaced by
paid civil servants, and the suggestion is
that the treatment will be less civil.
A statement borne out by comparative
figures of Sydney’s Prince Alfred Hospital
under the old order and a comparable
Maoriland hospital under the new.
"Encouraging Migrants."
“El Verdugo” puts the case:
One of the few matters on which the “Gov-
ernment” at Canberra appears to agree with its
political opponents is the need for nugrants.
Its attitude, as in the case of defence, is para-
For many a year before World War II
“Labor” policy was exclusionist. Labor
wanted iron gates set up against British immi-
grants (especially skilled men) on the ground
that such newcomers would compete with the
Australian worker —the natural corollary in
assumption being that the Australian worker
could not stand up against the competitor
of a race which his extremist leaders affected
to despite as “Pommies.” . ,
Learning in affright when the Japs attacked
that in modern war manpower is defence,
“Labor” has now embarked on a campaign
for- immigrants. The prophet of the new idea
is Mr. Calwell. His instrument is the “Depart-
ment of Information,” and his results such as
appear to suggesFThat so far nobody is willing
to brave the paradisaic conditions which he
offers by way of temptation save continental
Jews, chiefly German.
Mr. Calwell might aver that he is engaged
in a search for British immigrants and refer
to pamphlets issued under his orders. These
pamphlets are most expansive, and their
accounts of Australia are of the most flowery
description. For example:
With high standards of living and gener-
ous social services, Australia is aiming
to absorb 70,000 new people from over-
seas every year.
There are broad acres and new areas to
be developed. The prospective farmer
would be well advised to seek work in a
country area before buying a property of
his own Some capital is needed .. . .The
farmer-to-be has at his disposal the special-
ised services of the Australian Government
agencies. Australia’s main need today is
skilled operatives.... A Commonwealth Em-
ployment Service brings together labor and
demand for it.
Industrial workers in Australia are
protected by the Arbitration Courts and
the industrial system. Hours of work, fac-
tory conditions, wages and rates of pay
for overtime and compensation for injury
at work are all fixed by law.
And, finally, in large black type, beside an
elegant picture of Parliament House, Canberra:
Australia has no time for drones, no
room for slackers. This young Common-
wealth is a big, free land, anxious and will-
ing to welcome you. She has a lot to offer
to active and ambitious men and women
who wish to make a new life in a sunny
land of happy workers.
Nothing about Communist strikes or about
blackmarkets or sky-high taxes or the Krem-
lin-like grip of Government departments on
the transfer of property. Nor is the prospective
farmer told that his produce will as like as
not be national property, or that he will not
have the right to give away an egg or an
orange to a passing stranger without incurring
the penalties of the law. Nor are disabilities
reserved for British immigrants pointed out.
While foreign-blood concerns with an inter-
est in immigration have had conferred bn them
a status approaching that of Government de-
partments, recognition is denied to bodies like
the British Ex-Servicemen’s Imperial Eeague.
There is no bureau in any capital city to which
an arriving British serviceman (or one who re-
mains after service in the Pacific) can go to
obtain the kind of advice which meets his case.
Fortunately, perhaps, for if there were the
advice would be enough to cause him to make
a beeline for the nearest wharf.
For instance, he would learn that there is
no reciprocal arrangement between Britain and
Australia on repatriation benefits. He would
find that when he arrives here, if wounded,
he has no right to medical attention, which he
would receive in Britain; no other service
benefits; no authority with which he can deal
on the question of service pensions. He has
forfeited almost every personal right won in
the war. And he will discover that in regard
to local pensions he is actually under a grave
disparity beside the continental immigrant.
A European—German, Italian, Spaniard,
Bulgarian—if acceptable, can arrive in Aus-
tralia, obtain naturalisation within five years
and become eligible for all Australian benefits,
including the old-age pension. An old British
soldier who comes here must be in the country
20 years before he becomes eligible for old-age
pension, even though he may have served in
every war from Wandewash to Wadi Akarit.
A reciprocal system which makes the
privileges of citizenship interchangeable be-
tween the integral parts of the British Com-
monwealth is a first essential before there can
be any large-scale migration of British immi-
grants of the needed type to “this bright, happy
country” (Mr. Calwell).
Where Ward's Word Goes.
“G.T.G.” (Papua): The Provisional
Administration took over in October
and immediately plunged this terri-
tory into chaos. If the Australian
taxpayer knew how his money is
being squandered on window-dressing
without any solid benefits to the
native population he would lift the roof.
Consider £llB,OOO for a model village at
Hanuabada (Port Moresby) when people
in Australia are howling for houses.
Build it at Hanuabada, of course, where
it can be seen! To hell with the Rigo and
Tufi natives who were the “Angels” of the
Kokoda Trail. They live in the bush.
The Public Service has been scandal-
ously increased, although there are.no
more natives than before the war. Men
trained under the great Murray are
mostly fed-up to the back teeth.
Why the native is to be “uplifted” is a
bit of a mystery. At present he grows, on
ample lands and with little effort, suffi-
cient to keep him in plenty. He is to
be persuaded or bullied into agricul-
tural expansion. But who will take the
exportable surplus? Widespread medical
benefits he does need, but the new Ad-
ministration has done less with its vast
resources than Hubert Murray’s did with
meagre funds.
When A.N.G.A.U. handed over, native
laborers, having “had” years of Army
conscription, declined to sign civil inden-
tures and beat it for home. Naturally
every economic activity came to a full
stop. Now the natives are slowly seeking
work again. But that satanic figure the
professional recruiter is not in the race.
The Administration itself, committed to
the policy of keeping natives at home, is
recruiting them by the thousand to work
as Crown servants. Meanwhile planta-
tions remain at a standstill.
The indenture system before the war
was a voluntary contract. The native
alone chose whether he should seek in-
denture or not, and if so where he should
work and for how long. All Mr. Ward’s
blitherings to the effect that it was slavery
will not alter that fact. Now it is to be
abolished. / don’t care —I would just as
soon have a labor force of “casual”
laborers. But the native cares. He is the
chief upholder of indenture, but the Wise
and Good do not know that yet.
Before the war the all-in annual cost of
an ordinary laborer was about £lB. It has
now risen to over £5O. It seems impos-
sible to convince the Uncle Tom’s
Cabin mind that remuneration anywheie
is purely relative to needs. A native
laborer receives in addition to wages his
food, clothes, house, medical attention and
kit. He receives in cash and kind value

POLITICAL POINTS
At the beginning of the week a great
part of Queensland was still convulsed by
strikes and their consequences. The
Hanlon Government has ordered the meat
strikers to return to work next Friday.
This was a sequel to the abandonment
of its plan for a compulsory secret ballot,
the union books having been found to be
in such a mess that no proper vote could
be taken. The names of men who had
left the M.I.E.U. had been kept on the
books, apparently to the end that those
who returned to the meat trade might
be dunned for “arrears.” But cancella-
tion of the ballot was an anticlimax, and
the Locomen’s union seized the oppor-
tunity to order a ballot on a strike against
fines imposed on its members for refus-
ing to handle “black” bacon and meat.
“Never start a thing you can’t finish” is
a good maxim for Australian “ ‘Labor’
Governments” as well as Americans.
Taken to task by Fadden for the ex-
tension of the “Government’s” non-inter-
vention “policy” to the situation- in
Queensland, in which all the unions con-
cerned are federated unions, Chifley
added a forcible-feeble rider to his cus-
tomary “It’s a State matter” verdict:
I have never felt that you can drive
men back to work by enforcing the law.
If Mr. Fadden wants to call out the mili-
tary forces and allow them to shoot down
the strikers, then let him say that.
An extravagant utterance imperfectly
concealing infirmity of purpose, “Labor”
parties pass more laws than any other
party. If “Labor” Governments are
afraid to enforce the laws they have no
right to exist. Governments that are too
yellow to govern pave the way to civil
war.
Attlee is not coming to Australia after
all. He was to have been here on July
29, but July 29 is to be the second day
of the Peace Conference, Moscow per-
mitting. Moscow’s permission is condi-
tional on its vetting all the invitations —'
it bars China —and fixing all the rules of
procedure.
The Potsdam Agreement is now almost
a year old. Save for the clauses which
authorised Russia to grab German terri-
tory, plant and machinery, with Poland
sharing the territory, it has come to no-
thing in particular. There were to be
“swift and sure justice” for “major war
criminals” and “early peace treaties for
Italy, Bulgaria, Finland and Hungary”
(“the preparation of a peace treaty for
Italy” was placed “first among the im-
mediate important tasks”) and Poland was
to hold “free and unfettered elections”
as soon as “possible.” When he
compares performance with promise and
remembers how the “Big Four” of 1919
were slated for the dilatoriness as well as
the nature of their arrangements, Orlando,
the sole survivor, must give way to bitter
mirth.
It came out last week that Maxie
Falstein, “Labor” M.H.R. for Watson
(N.S.W.), had received a licence to import
£2700 worth of Swiss wristlet watches, a
privilege denied to firms and persons in
the watch-trade even if the persons were
in it before enlisting. Maxie “explained”
that he couldn’t get chambers in which
to practise as a barrister and that, any-
how, he intended to use the watches to
undersell the black market. He didn’t
think it worth mentioning that as a mem-
ber he gets £lOOO a year plus £1 2s. 6d.
when Parliament is in session, plus
a gold pass entitling him to free
travel in trams, trains and buses when
toting the watches around. In England
a lawyer-member so favored with an
import licence (if such a favor can be
imagined in such a country) would have
to do some more “explaining” —to the
Bar Council.
Pulling key men out of a factory and
then declaring the job “black,” though
he pulled-out men go to other jobs, is
he latest Communist stunt imported from
beyond the Pacific. A dirty trick, for
which leaders of branch unions have
been excommunicated by their American
executives, it seems a result of giving
Communists and fellow-travellers trips
abroad at the public cost. It has been too
much for Victorian foundry employers,
who have retaliated sharply; too much
even for the semi-Communist Sydney
Labor Council. The majority prevailing
for once, that body resolved that no union
should declare a job “black” without the
concurrence of itself and affected unions.
Wells, the Communist boss of the
Miners’ Federation, was reported on the
way to Queensland at the week-end,
having learned that some of the coal-
miners were working. On the N.S.W.
South Coast the situation was all that
the Communists could desire, there hav-
ing been an old-man stoppage “as a pro-
test against the dust menace.” If the
complaints are 10 p.c. true, the N.S.W.
“Labor” Government is the guilty party.
During a no-trams week-end in Sydney
there was a heavy toll of death and injury
by accident. Assault and robbery prac-
titioners were busy, too, though there was
something sardonic in the case of two
of their victims —they’d been enticed to
the scene with money on being tipped
that they could buy £4O worth of black-
market cigarettes. It was good bait, since
Customs men had raided the American
steamer Monterey, and seized large quan-
tities of smuggled smokes and other
goods, together with the smugglers, most
of whom were heavily fined. In civil life
and in the domain of militant unionism,
this is the day of the larrikin.
The Queensland Government is appa-
rently unimpressed by those lovely Com-
monwealth Employment Service display
advertisements advising everybody who
wants a job or a person for a job to
repair to “your nearest branch.” The
Hanlons have “reminded” all local autho-
rities, hospital boards and other bodies of
their agreement to use only State em-
ployment exchanges when seeking hands
for State-sponsored works, and told all
workers to register at the' exchanges.
A brave member of the Queensland
Storemen and Packers, W. H. Thompson,
has secured an Industrial Court declara-
tion that a levy on the strength of which
the lawless meat strike was heavily sub-
sidised was illegal. It was decided upon
at “a meeting of 80 or 90” storemen and
packers—there are 4822 —and when
Thompson refused to pay it he was
“threatened.” He despised the threat,
being an Old Digger.
Melbourne’s City Fathers considered
two proposals for the disposal of the
Eastern Market site in Bourke-street. One
envisaged a building containing two civic
theatres, large and small, and an exhibi-
tion hall; the other was a purely com-
mercial project with a car park. The
car park won, there being a matter of
£25,000 p.a, rentals to its advantage.
When it was Paddy’s Market the old
place contributed more to making a
brighter Melbourne than all the oratory
on the subject poured out by successive
Lud Mayors.
The venomous outpourings of Ralph
Ingersoll in Top Secret are a typical ex-
ample of the tendency of small minds
to convince themselves that the puddle
they wade in is the really big pond and
that others only seem bigger. The temp,
lieut.-col. was closely associated with
General Bradley, therefore Bradley was'
the outstanding military genius of the
war. Had chance attached him to Nimitz’s
Task Force, readers of “PM” (and the
Sydney “Daily Telegraph”) would prob-
ably have been treated to violent attacks
on MacArthur. Had he been wished on
the Air Force the stupidity of any inva-
sion of Europe, when bombing alone
could have won the war, might well have
been the theme of the Ingersoll Legends.
Westralian Senators Collett and Mac-
Donald are to have I. G. Boyle as a
running mate in the spring. Boyle was a
C.P. M.L.A. for eight years and he must
think highly of his chance. If he didn’t
he could wait a few months and stand
again for Avon, with the certainty of a
swing sufficient to carry him back into
the Assembly. In 1943 he was unseated
by a mere 15 votes,
A Mr. Goddard, of the Liquor Trades,
suggested at a Melbourne Trades Hall
Council meeting that an order be given
to Federal Labor Ministers to attend a
trade-union convention “so that they may
be told what the industrial movement
expects from them.” The order is super-
fluous, They know already.
After the last war, Westralian farmers,
among whom there were (and still are)
many Old Diggers, as there are many
Young Diggers now, got 9s. 4d. a bushel
for their 1919-20 wheat. There was then
no difference between the Australian
pound and the pound sterling, and taxes,
prices, labor costs and service charges
were light compared with what they are
now. With everything altered for the
worse, these farmers are to be compelled
to take ss. 2d. at ports for their 1945-46
wheat, with a promise or problematical
chance of getting something more at some
future date. They are an outspoken breed
and their objections are putting the wind
up Lemmon and Mountjoy, who fluked
two old C.P. electorates in 1943.
“It is now a case of brown coal or no
fuel at all for Victoria,” Cain said that
last week, and repeated it at a conference
at which the Chamber of Manufactures
and the Metropolitan Gas Co., as well as
the State Electricity Commission and the
Railway Department, were represented.
N. S. Wales once had a great coal-export
trade with almost every Pacific country.
“Militants” killed it off and they have
already gone far towards killing off the
trade with other States.
In the “hollow crystal” of Victoria’s
“winter dream” are a black-coal short-
age, gas rationing, little firewood —be-
cause saws to cut it are scarce —a short-
ened country train service, a curtailed
suburban service, electricity restrictions
and part-time work in factories. Add to
which are notices terminating the ser-
vices of 3500 men employed in 90 Vic-
torian foundries; reasons, refusal of
unions to approach the Arbitration Court,
banning of overtime, introduction of go-
slow tactics, organised mass resignations
from factories and imposition of a quota
system which reduced working capacity to
three-eighths. On the day these notices
were announced the State “Labor’
Government blithely announced that it
was ratifying an order for 5000 Beaufort
prefabricated steel houses on the lines
of the slim sample in the Fitzroy Gardens.
Months ago “Morrie” O’Sullivan, the
N.S.W. “Labor” Minister of Transport
—the same who promised “special trains”
for his “Government’s” Turf Club “meet-
ing” on a tramless Saturday afternoon —
comforted the overwrought though still-
faithful trammies with an assurance that
hundreds of modern trams were on order.
Now his tale is that trams are to be
scrapped altogether.
In Melbourne Chairman Bell of the
Tramways has declared his hatred of
both trolley-cars and buses and promised
to introduce trams which will be “noise-
less.” And the “Labor” Government is
backing his Tramway Board’s decision to
spend £833,700 on “a comprehensive
works programme” employing “110 addi-
tional men,” and to send “three executive
officers” to the U.S.A. Bell’s conclusion
is that “trams are cheaper than buses to
run, carry greater loads and are the best
form of transport for Melbourne.”
Sydney “Labor’s” prevailing idea is that
Shanks’s pony is the best form of week-
end transport for Sydney and Newcastle
—in the latter case because it is inexpedi-
ent to carry coal to Newcastle.
Rev. H, J. Whitney, a Presbyterian
minister from Bundaberg (N.Q.), was
preaching at Scots’ Church, Sydney, when
the Bunnerong coal, steel and shipping
strikes brought a blackout. Part of his
sermon was devoted to the deprivation,
and it was so powerful that the lights
came on again in all Sydney churches.
Now he’s hit the same trouble in his own
church at Bundaberg, and off come the
gloves again:
The churches meet for worship on Sunday
evenings for about an hour and a half.
They are instructed to eliminate this act of
divine worship because a tiny percentage
of a small section of the community says
so The Government has failed to do its
duty. It is afraid of the union bosses
Let the churches refuse to put out their
lights on Sunday and let the Government
convict them —if it dares.
Bundaberg, with Bert Hinkler and Gladys
Moncrieff to its credit, can now claim a
fighting parson of a kind the country
can do with.
In Sydney last week 66 members of ah
R.S.L. sub-branch, dissatisfied at League
“indifference” (denied) to the retrench-
ment of temporary Commonwealth em-
ployees, decided to secede to the Legion.
This development and the set-up must
be satisfactory to those who did not
want to see all the men who wore
uniform subsequently united into one
great organisation whose representations
it would be politically unsafe to ignore.
Though no organisation has served both
the Diggers and Australia better than the
R.S.L., it would be hard for it to refute
a general charge of having made possible
the rival show on its big scale.
The Bulletin is indebted to
U.N.R.R.A. for a statement on “the value
of supplies allocated” in Europe, calcu-
lated in U.S. dollars:
Albania .. .. . • $25,000,000
Byelorussia .. ■. • • 50,000,000
Austria .. .. • • • ■ 75,000,000
Ukrainia .. •• •• 158,000,000
Czechoslovakia .. • • 262,500,000
Greece 375.000,000
Italy 409,000,000
Yugoslavia .. . • • • 432,500,000
Poland .. .. .. . • 444,200,000
So two Russian “republics” and four
Russian satellites have received most of
the gifts, and none of them seems a bit
grateful.
“Mrs. 0.T.”: I wish Mr. McKell had

I had two children ill in bed, and a hus-
band and a son to get off to work, both

of a well-dressed artilleryman on leave,
he asked a British soldier the way. In
replying the Tommy addressed him as
“sir.” “Why do you call me sir?” asked
“Lefty,” “I’m not an officer.” “Well,”
replied the Tommy, “in the first place I
noticed your shoes. In our army only
officers wear shoes. Then there’s your
cap”—“Lefty” was sporting a driver’s
cap; “only the officers wear caps.”
“That’s all right, mate,” said “Lefty,”
“I’m only a gunner.” The other stiffened,
then in parade-ground voice he thun-
dered, “Then stand to attention when
you’re addressing me. I’m a lance-
corporal.”
“Zake”: Is there a word in the English
language more abused in the press than
that old warrior “popular”? It is flogged
to death in application to everyone, from
the Bookie to the Bumble. The latest dis-
torted use of it comes in a message from
Brisbane, in which strike-torn city, one
learns, “the community use of wood
stoves and coppers is becoming popular.”
If 1 had an asbestos ’phone I’d like to
ring some Brisbane housewife and ask her
whether this substitute for the comfort
of cooking in her own kitchen was really
“popular” with housewives,

“Colbun”: Any technically correct
stage villain of the “East Lynne” period
(B. 26/6/’46) would smoke his nefarious
cigarette through a long holder. A
Russian invention originally, cigarettes
came to England after the Crimean War
and received a hostile reception, particu-
larly when women began to take to them.
The first English manufacturer was
Robert P. Gloag, in 1860, and his little
backroom London factory, turning out
2000 or so a day, was the object of
several hostile demonstrations by earnest-
minded persons who professed to believe
that the accursed newfangled things were
sapping British vitality. But the novelty
caught on, and by the end of the Edwar-
dian period the cigarette habit had cap-
tured over 70 per cent, of English
smokers, men and women both. Now,
it is calculated that, for every 100 fags
smoked by men, women light up 67.
Holders and paper mouthpieces have gone
out of fashion, but the average fag-addict
who does not use one wastes a quarter of
each smoke.

“Ike Hollar”: Human chicken-hatchers,
is it? There is the De Maupassant story of
the man who, becoming bedridden, was
paid by his wife to take the role of a
broody hen; at first ashamed, he ulti-
mately became proud of his hatchings.
But the most consistent human chicken
hatcher was probably a Waverley (Syd-
ney) woman who lived in a shanty on a
large slice of land and tffed poultry.
She was a hard-working dame and felt
that even her sleeping hours should be
turned to account, so she took settings of
eggs to bed with her, covering the
blankets over them to retain the heat
when she rose in the morning. Carrying
on from hatching to hatching, she must
have brought thousands of chickens into
the world ; but it was the increase in the
value of her land, originally a useless
stretch of scrub, that made her a rich
woman before she died. I enjoy a grin
every time I see the “avenue” of swanky
flats which now bears her name. The
“avenue” follows the line of the old sand
track along which the dame drove in her
buggy to do the round of the pubs and
restaurants where she sold her poultry,

“Bo”: I note that a Cornish verger,
charged with pinching nine quid from a
not only admitted hav-
ing busted all but a few bob of it on beer
but “boasted that he could drink 18 pints
in an evening.” So what? Far be it from
me to make it a matter of national rivalry,
but Sydney has dozens of 18-pint topers
who can also boast that they’ve never
conducted anyone to a pew.

“F S.”: Rain dripping and seeping into
the Sydney National Gallery may damage
a few pictures, but Nature’s fell hand is
nothing to the damage that has been done
for centuries by the well-intentioned hands
of human beings. The present genera-
tion has never really seen or ever will see
an old master —all it sees is the bare resi-
“ Mornin ", Sister —meet the missus. She's campin' here till she can find
a house."
due of the original work. Most of the old
masters haven’t suffered so much from
time as from man’s desire for a finished
job. An enthusiastic young painter was
given the job of cleaning a picture in one
of our national collections and spent
weeks washing off what he took for
grease. What he actually rubbed off along
with the grease were the glazes a genius
had carefully added to his painting to
preserve it; all that was left when he
finished was the under-painting.

“Nakh”; The lady who got an attack
of asthma on being confronted with
a china cat (B. 26/6/’46) reminds me of
another who was a martyr to hayfever.
We were walking along a country road
near Melbourne and she confided how
glad she was to have escaped the Sydney
wattle season, which always gave her the
sneezes. We turned a corner and were
confronted with a huge Cootamundra in
full blossom and she instantly went off
in a paroxysm of sneezing. Even when
I told her we had passed dozens of the
genus blossoming profusely though out of
sight in the gullies, she refused to believe
that there was anything psychological in
her complaint.

“Chevroford”: Although Victoria was
mercifully spared a major bushfire this
year, almost the same number of people
—76 —have been killed on the public
highways since Christmas as perished in
the State’s worst conflagration. Contri-
buting factors were road hogs, worn-out
cars and drivers grown old or rusty. Also
partly responsible is the sense of false
security produced during nearly six years
when war-time exigencies forced the
country back to the horses. Country
roads became pleasant places you could
stroll along, sometimes for miles, without
hearing the honk of a horn —only the
clop-clop of hoofs approaching or reced-
ing. A juvenile sport that was revived in
my district was scooter races down the
main street. Six abreast, the contestants
roared down the hills without risk of
meeting anything more lethal than a bike
or a buggy. Even the animal creation
reverted to its old habits; dogs which
had learnt by bitter experience to shun
the highways slept in the middle of them
dreaming of some canine heaven. That’s
all gone now, but it takes a while to re-
condition a population.

“McGlum”: Bernard Shaw might not
be pleased to know that high-ranking Japs
viewed an Aussie p.-0.-w. performance
of “Augustus Does His Bit” on Hainan,
but he would be delighted with an inci-
dent arising out of it. The leading “lady”
was gorgeously apparelled in creations
from the wardrobe of a Dutch commo-
dore’s wife; made up with brick-dust
hosiery, tfeased rice-bag wig, prickly pear-
juice rouge and rice-flour facepowder.
The Jap big noise saw the glamorous
figure and demanded an explanation of
the presence of an English female in the
prison compound.

“Gravelsnatcher”: When we arrived at
the weighbridge the attendant was be-
moaning the loss of his keys. The old
chap knew us and our truck well, and
was anxious to help. “If y’re in a hurry
and y’re not fussy to a pound or two,” he
said, “I’ll ‘galvanic’ the weight f’r y’.”
A brief question confirmed my suspicions
that he was an ex-railwayman, so I gave
him his head and accepted his weight
without question. The word is seldom
heard now, but “galvanic” was once quite
common usage among railwaymen in
W.A. Trucks to be weighed are taken
over the weighbridge on the run, and the
attendants develop a sixth sense. Occa-
sionally, when the bridge was in use, a
single truck in another rake required to
be weighed, and the train crew was in a
hurry. Then an old hand would “gal-
vanic” the weight, and seldom was he out
in his guess. Once saw an old-timer
“galvanic” an entire rake of wheat, and
when an inspector ordered that rake over
the bridge the difference was negligible.

“Morehead”: There are jokers who
collect degrees and diplomas and embark
upon courses of study with the same
enthusiasm as other people hoard postage
stamps and old coins. One acquaintance
has the bug very badly. After graduating
at a university in Arts, he went on and
got his LL.B. Since then he has gained
a diploma from an accountancy institute
and has completed correspondence
courses in freelance journalism, showcard
writing and poultryfarming. When I
last ran into him he was contemplating a
course in Diesel engineering. His certifi-
cates and diplomas make a fine display on
his bedroom wall, but I have never dis-
covered what earthly use they are to him.
He has been an insurance canvasser as
long as I can remember, and looks like
remaining one until the end of his days.

“Gunner”: It was one of Melbourne’s
blustery winter days so the hotdog man’s
invitation to “Git yer frankfurt and roll
—’ot and fresh,” made good sense to me
as I came through the gates of L.T.D. I
huddled over his brazier as I bit into the
roll. “Nice, eh?” he queried. “Fresh, ain’t
they? That’s why I do so good. Keep
everything nice and fresh and clean.
Look at this. Keep the rolls in this big
case. None of them baskets that let all
the muck blow in.” He broke off to serve
a batch of customers. His hands worked
deftly as he reached for a frankfurt, slid
it into a roll, sliced it, waved the sauce-
bottle over it, handed it to the customer
and dropped the coin on to the ground.
When he had served them all, he knelt
down, scooped the money into a heap
and picked up the coins along with a few
matches and cigarette butts and general
debris. The lot he dropped into the
pocket of his once-white apron. “That’s
why I do so good,” he repeated—“keep
everything nice and fresh and clean.”

“Cine Ma”: Hollywood’s cavalier atti-
tude towards the authors out of whom it
makes such enormous profits (B.'
26/6/’46) has had numerous illustrations
in Melbourne, where a film based oil a
story by Chekhov was shown without any
mention of the Russian writer. Another
classical example was a note in a Holly-
wood film journal: “Thomas Hardy,
novelist, died today. His Tess of the
D’Urbevilles was a starring vehicle for
Douglas Fairbanks.”
“G.F.8.”: In fairness to Hollywood I
must point out that the film itself
does give credit to the author of
“The Virginian.” Owen Wister’s name
appears, in the opening flash as the reel
unfolds. But I did notice one peculiarity
about the picture. Though a cattle-
country atmosphere, with its ranges,
ranches, roughriders, rustlers and round-
ups is preserved, not one dog is seen.

“Sea Daddy”: Returning from overseas
I brought back a gift for Dad, a Chinese
trick box —one of those neat, polished,
oblong boxes with no apparent lid or
opening, but with strips of wood cun-
ningly let into the sides. I showed him
how, by pressing these strips, it could be
opened in 32 movements, and he decided
it was just the thing in which to keep
his fishhooks. A sunny day out in the
boat, with the fish biting well, saw him
lose his hook and trace and ho turned to
the box for a new hook. After 400 frantic
movements, while the others were pulling
in fish as fast they could hook ’em, he
gave up and smashed the box open with
a hammer. Now he keeps his hooks in
a screw-top glass jar with the lid well
greased.

“Willem”: A hint for sufferers from
cigarette-paper famine: “Size” best

starch (thus reducing its porosity), dry
the paper and cut it to the standard size.
It sticks without gum, and smokes well.

“Bondi Beachcomber”: A non-com-
batant unit, we were well behind the
\ fighting, but repeated stories of infiltra-
ting Japs had us on our toes. When
shrill screaming rang out from a tent
about midnight, men grabbed rifles, gren-
ades and tommy-guns and surrounded the
tent. Our captain burst into it with his
torch flashing, but all he saw was white-
faced Snow and Herb rearranging their
bed-rolls. We slept on the ground in
those days and Herb, having a nightmare,
had rolled across to Snow and clutched
him round the throat. With Nips on his
mind, Snow had done the screaming.
Blue, the third member of the tent, who
woke to find two yelling figures rolling
about in the dark, swears that only the
jamming of his rifle savrcl Herb’s life.

“E.H.S.”: Renovations have brought
into relief from their obscurity beneath
the accumulation of dust and soot of the
years two well-carved stone figures above
the porch of an old hotel not far from
Woolloomooioo Bay. One is that of a
rooster crowing lustily to greet the dawn ;
the other an owl about to sally forth on
his nightly hunting. The tavern’s name
is “The Early and Late.” The extended
hours of convivial drinking suggested by
the cheery pair must raise nostalgic
memories in the breasts of those who
have to join in the daily six-o clock rush.

“Seaforth”: Travelling to town every
morning I generally sit behind two
rniddle-agers who take life seriously
in a futile fashion. Throughout the five-
mile journey they gloomily discuss the
morning news ; civil war, strikes, acci-
dents, robberies and Government mis-
management are all debated ponderously
and at great length. They often start oft
with different opinions, but they invariably
end up by sharing the same pessimistic
viewpoint. Each subject is disposed of by
the one with the “I dunno
what the world’s cornin’ to,” which is
capped with a snort from his pal: “Some-
one ought to do somethin’ about it. The
bewilderment of the one and the readi-
ness of the other to pass the buck seem
to typify the attitude of the great majority
to most current topics —those who are
frankly puzzled and those who think its
someone else’s responsibility.
THE SPORT OF KINGS.
“Though racing is known as the Sport of Kings,
some of the evidence the jury has heard in this case”
(a dispute over the division of gambling spoils)
“must have shocked them.” — N.S.W. Justice Herron.
Racing the Sport of Kings? A game
Of laying odds and punting!
An older, Judge, and worthier claim
Has been advanced for hunting.
From Norman Will to Woodbine Ted
How many chose the chances
Of riding alter hounds, instead
Of merely backing fancies!
The Sport of Kings? Of some perhaps
Who, weighed and measured singly,
Would hardly seem the sort of chaps
To make the grade as kingly.
One king-to-be who played the gees,
Remember, came a cropper,
Warned off the turf for practices
Which stewards deem improper.
The Sport of Kings! A tag to be
Served up to us with solemn
And regular persistency
In many a sporting column;
Though nowadays a king himself
Must ever run the risk hard
Of being shoved upon the shelf
Or dumped into the discard.
The Sport of Kings! It sort of stamps
With light that glows and reddens
Drab scenes where some are rigging ramps
And some are laying dead ’uns.
It carries euphemistic charms
For those who mix and mingle
Round raucous rings, like Royal Arms
Below a tradesman’s shingle.
The Sport of Kings! A piquant phrase
That holds a pleasant flavor,
Yet one the Bench, it seems, surveys
With no especial favor.
But, Judge, be sure whatever stings
You sense in such revealings,
Little that litigation brings
To light about the Sport of Kings
Can shock a jury’s feelings.

“Petermac”: Waiting for a bus in a
well-lit Sydney suburb I asked the first
passer-by for a match. He stared fur-
tively at me for a moment, quickened his
pace and walked on. The next, a young
fellow carrying football togs, showed a
clean pair of heels by doing the next
hundred yards in just about evens. The
third poked his bespectacled head from
under an umbrella, feigned deafness and
broke into a trot, I had almost given up
hope of a light when an amiable drunk
staggered up. After listening to his drool-
ing for five minutes I got what I wanted.

“Uco”: To’a city that is daily nause-
ated by tales of assaults, bashings, hold-
ups and other outrages which cause pessi-
mists to fear that the milk of human
kindness has dried up for ever, twice in
one week came reassuring evidence to the
contrary. At Bondi, on a cold June
morning, a man went into the surf to
rescue an injured swan in trouble in the
breakers, revived it with a noggin of rum
and found it comfortable winter quarters
at the Zoo. The other incident was the
rescue of a draught horse which had
fallen from Pyrmont wharf, and,
hampered by its harness, was in danger
of drowning. A young ex-Digger dived
in and struggled with, the frantic animal
for half an hour, part of the time in
darkness beneath the wharf, until he man-
aged to get the horse to a spot where a
mobile crane was able to lift it to safety.

“Becks” on a condemned island:
once again He]igo3and is to be destroyed-
thjs tjme t h e sentence of the court is that it
shall be blown up and made useless for mili-
tary purposes. Birdlovers in Britain have pro-
tested against the decision, claiming that the
island is a staging camp for migratory birds,
but army authorities promise that when the
sappers have finished with the place it will be
ideal for a bird-roost and useless for anything
else as if will b'e merely a heap of rocks.
Generations of these birds have seen many
changes in the small triangular island with its
red cliffs weathered into caves and columns.
Heligoland was in ancient times the sight of
a heathen temple which St. Ludger, an early
Christian, destroyed; St. Willibrord preached
there in the seventh century. On account of
its strategic position covering the mouths of
the Elbe and the Weser it was a great lurking
place for Viking pirates, and the same reason
gave it its modern place in the,sun and now
brings about its final destruction. Down to
Napoleon’s time the island was mostly under
Danish rule as part of the Schleswig-Holstein
tt’of b ‘£oSnS, , !;%r r S e i 0 id th b e y SS&
and at the end of the war was formally ceded
“Give us a yell when they're ready to move off.
to Britain, in whose possession it remained
until 1890, when the Salisbury Government
handed it over to Germany-ihto whose hands
Schleswig-Holstein had passed—at a time when
African colonial claims were being staked.
The general idea was that the gift would
ifnprove Anglo-Germaff relations, but it didn’t
work out that way. Germany at once set to
work transforming what had been a seaside
holiday resort into a powerful fortress, which
was of great value to it when the Kaiser
went to war. Under the VersaiUes Treaty the
fortifications were demolished, but by the time
Hitler was ready to continue the fight the
stronghold was more formidable than ever,
Possibly the present attempt may be more sue-
cessful. In any case the birds will continue to

“Eureka”: Orchestral conductors have
been making a lot of fuss about lost
batons—one recently threatened to refuse
to conduct again in Sydney until his
missing wand was returned—and it would
appear that a specially-carved and -bal-
anced baton is just as important to an
orchestra as the flute or the violin. Up
till now I have always thought that the
baton was merely part of the conductor’s
dress, like his tie and tails, and that a
good conductor could carry on just as
well with any old piece of stick or even
his bare hands. But then I’m .not a pro-
fessor and perhaps do not realise the
music that there is in a baton.

“Leon”: We were discussing ghost
stories and the queer things that happen
to blokes when they are alone, either
with or without a bottle. Bill had been
an ambulance driver and this was his
contribution. “One night,” he said,V‘T

body—a poor coot had been accidentally
killed. On the way back I came to the
crossroads. Not being sure which way I
had come, I just took a chance. All
of a sudden a voice yells out from the
back, ‘Hey, mate, you’re on the wrong
road.’ I left that truck very smartly, for
I knew the joker I had put in there was
properly dead, but when she crashed into
a bank the bloke who abused me was
very much alive. He was going a.w.l.

if he might have the radio on while he
sat on the porch to listen to a programme

for leaving the door as it was, but his
spouse insisted that she’d never be able to
sleep with their defences down, so Jeph-
son prepared a barricade of chairs and

retired. Hours later a thunderous knock-
ing bit into Jephson’s dreams, lacerated
them and hauled him forth. A cold
westerly was shrieking past the house and
Jephson stood shivering in the kitchen
and yelled questions at the barricade. A
voice outside yelled back, but nothing
could be made of it, so Jephson cloaked
himself, went forth into the night and

The C. 0., an amiable old chap, invited me

“Two politicians who call each other all the names

—Professor Murdoch.
They may of course be tried and trusty cobbers
In private life, a truly model pair,
Inseparable mates, confirmed hobnobbers,
The same as Jonathan and David were,
These chaps you’ll hear calling each other
robbers
And rogues (when Parliament comes on the
air)
And cowardly curs, and other epithets
Which none who hears them readily forgets.
Each may be really a firm believer
In Pother’s sterling worth, beyond a doubt;
It’s only in the height of party fever
They bandy evil names. When school is out
You’ll find them like the Butcher and the

That Lewis Carroll wrote a poem about,
Or Corydon and Thyrsis, it may be,
Or even Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
He sees, the prof., blokes who’ve been swap-
ping raspers
Of Saxon speech, and savage jeers and gibes,
Becoming, when the barney’s over, claspers
Of mutual hands and then, to banish fears
Of variance, handing one another gaspers
And warmly fraternising over beers
To make it clear they’re not the sort of birds
To feel resentment at opprobrious words.
It’s true that public slanging may engender
No little rift in Damon’s sweet accord
With Pythias. But' a complete surrender
Of preconceived beliefs I can’t afford
Till word arrives of Ward inviting Spender
To drink, or Harrison inviting Ward.
Till then your picture, prof., let me conclude,

Bomb-burst at Bikini.
“Ek Dum”: The atom bomb having
gone off with not so loud a bang,
“famous” correspondents who went to
“observe” the explosion from 18 miles
away (at which distance most targets
would be well below the horizon of sea-
level sight)*are now walking round with
the air of men who have been invited to
a pogrom and arrived at a tea party.
There was a censorship, lifted in part
to reveal a few facts:
At 8.2 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, a
bomb weighing an unknown number of
tons was dropped from a 829 flying at
an unestablished height (unofficially
30,000 feet) on an unarmed and anchored
fleet laid out in still waters, the area
defined by the enclosing reef and atoll.
The ships had no power to ward off
attack either by an anti-aircraft barrage,
by fighter cover or by evasion. The
weather was clear enough for visual
observation of the target; the bomber
crew had no distractions of mind due to
the arrival of large lumps of flak in their
vicinity and they were not subject to the
fatigue incident to a long flight such as
was routine in the main bombings of
Japan by 8295.
The conditions were, indeed, such as
would have called for the use in European
“It might come in handy!’
waters of three or four Lancasters or
Lincolns armed with heavy bombs in the
six-ten ton range to deal with the heavier
ships, and a squadron or so crated up
with lighter pills for the tin-can fleet on
which it was not worth while to waste
heavy stuff.
It is a mathematical certainty that a
single run by such a force under such
conditions would have been almost 100
per cent, capitally effective ; that the ships,
from battleships to barges, would have
been scrap-iron, most of them on the
bottom.
Anything the ten-tonners hit would
have been blown to blithering blazes ;
palm-trees—uninjured at Bikini —within
the considerable ambit of blast would
have been torn to pieces. Dozens of
living things which had not been blown to
atoms would have been found whisked
out of their hides and be dead hundreds
of yards from where they started the
horrible adventure. There would be all
the usual heavy-blast casualties —markless
dead, victims of suction, and dead cut to
ribbons by flying fragments. The goats
munching hay afterwards would have
been found roaming the Golden Fields.
Low-level and High-level
Ordinary bombs would have been
dropped from a low level and with an
unerring precision. The exact effect of
them would have been known before the
start, and would have been clearly appa-
rent afterwards. The atomic bomb was
dropped to explode at a great height, and
appears to have gone off not over the
calculated blast centre, but some distance
from it —at least a quarter of a mile —
also, according to one authority in the
broadcasting world, three seconds before
it was fused or suppbsed to be fused to
go off. In the result it exploded H mile
higher than it was planned to be ex-
ploded.
Some other facts are fairly clear. There
is some reason connected with the action
of the bomb which makes it wise
both to drop and to explode it at con-
siderable heights to get a full effect.
None of the great newspaper minds
has applied itself to this intriguing
question. The dropping height explains
itself, since it is obvious that any aircraft
which tried low-level bombing with it
would not come home.
The Bomb’s Action
The explanation of the need to explode
it at height will tell its tale quite clearly
to the experts in conjunction with its
seemingly erratic behavior. Part of it
may lie in the remark of two “observers”
that “the greater part of the force of the
blast blew skyward.” The bomb, seem-
ingly, needs a clear field below it —elbow-
room. From the erratic manner in which
it struck down its targets and with which
its blast operated, the method of its func-
tioning seems to have been somewhat as
follows:
Upon the explosion taking place the
material of the bomb flew apart, as if it
had been propelled through holes in a
bag, these parts (of various sizes) being
hurled in various directions like missiles.
These fragments varied in composition as
their disintegration, or some other pro-
cess in which they were caught up, pro-
ceeded. The initial explosion had little
universal blast effect comparable with
that of an ordinary heavy-blast bomb.
Its force was delivered along a number of
channels by the fragments, flying like the
missiles of a giant machine-gun gone
mad.
Upon these fragments striking some
“hard” object a secondary explosion took
place, and the result of this was deter-
mined by ( a ) the size of the fragment,
( b ) the stage of disintegration of the
fragment which had been reached and
the consequent stage of radio-activity.
These secondary explosions all had a
blast effect, though what its comparative
degree would be is unknown, since the
size and nature of the fragments involved
are unknown.
Certainly by modern bombing stan-
dards the experiment was a disappoint-
ment. Little damage was done to ships,
with one exception, which could not have
been done by a direct hit of a one-tonner
or a few incendiaries.
The Casualties
The Navy listed as sunk five ships, all
of them of tin-can type except the 6000-
ton Jap cruiser Sakawa, which armchair
experts have insisted on describing as a
-battleship. The others were two trans-
ports and two destroyers, and the blast
may have exploded a submarine, which
turned over. One aircraft carrier, the
10,000-ton Independence, lost its island
and caught fire. The cruiser Pensacola
was considerably battered, but still well
afloat.
Generally speaking, fire damage seems
to have been more serious than blast
damage and more certain. But in estimat-
ing this it must be remembered that the
ships were crewless and that, in the course
of an ordinary battle, fire is a common
hazard. A great number of the fires
which caused serious damage in the case
of the atom bomb Would have been put
out promptly if there had been crews in
the ships. And crews there certainly
wodld have been in most, since 90 per
cent, of the animals of the fleet have

What
LIFE ASSURANCE
can do for your family
While everyone needs Life Assurance some
people fail to take the necessary steps to
secure it.
Although Life Assurance pro-
vides necessary protection
against some of the greatest
risks of life many people
hate to think about these
risks, and so they deny them-
selves and their families the
comfort and protection that
Life Assurance can give.
That is why so many people
have to be persuaded to
take adequate Lite Assur-
ance.
Do you know what Life As-
surance can do for you and
your family? Do you know
that hundreds of thousands
of Australian homes will be
FATHERED by Lite Assur-
ance when the breadwinners
die?
In thousands of homes to-
day, Life Assurance is feed-
ing children, preserving home
life, keeping families to-
gether, paying off mort-
gages, maintaining incomes,
providing higher education,
giving peace of mind.
The Life Offices in Australia
have undertaken to pay in
the future over £750,000,000
to their policy holding fami-
lies. Think what this means
in terms of future security to
these families, and through
them to the nation as a
whole!

Taranto and Pearl Harbor
At Taranto, on November 11, 1940,
obsolescent machines from H.M. aircraft-
carrier Illustrious and the old Eagle,
operating against a closed harbor de-
fended by ground guns, ship batteries
and a balloon barrage and aircraft cover,
beached the 35,000-ton battleship Littorio,
put one Cavone cruiser on the beach
and another on the bottom, threw two
cruisers stem under and listing, and put
two auxiliaries half under water. Bombs
available at that time were babies.
At Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941,
again when naval armament was in its
infancy, the Japs, using bombs the
heaviest of which weighed certainly not
more than a ton:
(a) Sank the battleship Arizpna, which
was destroyed by the explosion of its
boiler and then of its forward magazine
owing to a bomb which passed down its
smokestack.
( b ) Sank and mangled four other battle-
ships and a number of cruisers, destroyers
and other ships.
(c) Wreaked tremendous shore damage
and caused thousands of military, naval
and civilian casualties.
Nothing comparable to this happened
at Bikini. And there was no single in-
stance of the boilers in a ship blowing
up—all were dead —and, which was more
remarkable, no instance of a magazine
detonating. It seems certain that most of
the ships would have remained operable.
The Bikini blast, of course, was pro-
duced by only one missile, whereas other
historic blasts have been caused by
several; but the use of the several in
the old-style bombings was infinitely less
costly than that of the one at Bikini.
This action was harder for an enemy
to ward off, and would be more so now
with the development of modernised
radar, which is so sensitive that it should
presumably be able to single out an
atom-bomb-carrying aircraft, even if it
cannot with certainty do so now.
Materials Available
The explosion in atom-bombing is
obtained, apparently, by bringing two
quantities of material together. When
they reach a critical weight, they explode,
but no outsider knows whether the weight
is small or great. The alleged weight of
the bomb (four tons) and the wide distri-
bution of fragments suggest a consider-
able bulk of explosive material. In view
of the scarcity of such material, of which
the known weight in the world is only a
few tons, the number of bombs must be
limited unless artificial material of the
same nature can be turned out reasonably
cheaply and in great bulk.
Still a Navy
The opinions of observers at Bikini of
results seem to vary considerably. A Mr.
George Moorad, of the Columbia Broad-
casting Corporation, who saw Nagasaki
after the bombing of it, says:
I cannot tell you if I did or did not see
the fleet, but there is nothing to prevent
my telling you rny personal opinion that
this was an unsatisfactory test and, more-
over, contains a highly suspicious factor
that is not ended by this sudden imposi-
tion of censorship In my opinion the
full story of bomb damage at Bikini will
lead to a conclusion that atomic power is
nothing more radical than the refinement
T.N.T. has over Chinese gunpowder. I
believe that this is a wrong conclusion....
Something happened to make this test mis-
leading I believe it should be repeated.
On the other hand, Mr. Forrestal, U.S.
Secretary for the Navy, said that the
target ships had suffered relatively unim-
portant damage and were apparently still
operable.
“There will be navies in the future/
he added, “and the American Navy will
remain the most powerful,”
A Fiendish Factor
The novel feature of the bomb appears
to be the radio-activity produced by the
scattered secondary explosions which
arise from it. The intensity and persis-
tence of this do not, obviously, arise
from the violence of blast at the point of
impaction, but from some other factors
perhaps the “critical” size of the explod-
ing fragment, the force of impact or the
nature of the material with which the
disintegrating fragment finds itself in con-
tact.
The effects on animal life are, however,
beyond question, though the degree of
effect is not. Any human or animal within
the blast area of a “fragment” is bom-
barded with Gamma rays.; in other words
suffers a deep X-ray treatment without
the mitigation of shielding and without
time limit. The results to the victim are
horrible. Some part or all of his body
is bombarded by a torrent of particles
which produce a dreadful, delayed burn-
ing, as painful as or more so than a phos-
phorus burn, which can bring up a linger-
ing death of an almost incurable dis-
figurement and scarring if it is external.
It alters the whole corpuscle content of
the blood. It can produce sterility and
anaemia, which may be long delayed, an
all the other dreadful results so well-
known to deep X-ray workers, who guard
themselves with proper shielding and a
regular system of blood counts whicn
reveal the danger signals.
This phase of atomic bombing and its
failures in other directions make its
nature clear. It is adapted chiefly to the
wholesale slaughter of innocent citizens,
men, women and children, babies in arms,
invalids in hospitals ; to their destruction
by a method of torture such as no
mediaeval inquisitor could have envisaged
for actual use this side of hell itself. It
is a weapon not of men but of devils.
All the English-speaking nations and the
little democracies are ready and anxious
to outlaw it, using, U.N.O. as a medium.
Only Russia remains the “nark” for
what reason Moscow alone knows.
"Labor " and Motive Troops.
In the Senate last week answers were
supplied to questions asked by Senator
Sampson —an Old Digger and father of
Young Diggers-—which threw a little light
on the aftermath of the Ward-Forde
policy towards the sensitive native of
New Guinea and on what the future
promises if the policy continues,
Mr. Forde (per Senate deputy) to Old
Digger Sampson:
Approval has already been given for the dis-
bandment of three of the four native infantry
battalions of the Pacific Islands Regiment, ine
remaining battalion (Third New Guinea In-
fantry) is being maintained at gradually_ re-
ducing strength until completion in the KaPaui
area of the trials of Japanese war criminals.
From time to time there have been instances
of collective insubordination among groups ot
native troops, involving in some instances
threats of the use of force. These distur-
bances arose because of real or fancied
ances relating to conditions of service, fooa,
etc., and were all brought under control witn-
out difficulty or the use of force, either by
redressing the grievance or by explanation ot
the position which was accepted by the troops
involved. In some cases disciplinary action was
taken against individuals concerned.
While similar occurrences among, white troops
would be regarded as mutiny, in no case was
the disturbance among the native troops ot
such proportions that, having regard to the
native temperament and surroundings, it was
considered to amount to mutiny.
Junior officers from Royal Military College
and Officer Cadet Training Unit 'were posted
from time to time to native battalions in the
Pacific Islands Regiment. Experience proved
that, except in a few cases, such officers were
eminently suitable for the duties of the appoint-
ments they had to perform and that in very
short periods they gained the necessary experi-
ence to handle natives.
The sting is in the tail. Canberra’s
notion that “in very short periods” a
young officer can learn to handle natives
sets all old hands back on their heels.
The proportion of seasoned officers of
the last war who colonised New Guinea
and who have been there for 25 years
and have learned to speak real pidgin is
limited, and not 10 per cent, of men
who have been consistently handling
native labor for up to five years can
claim to have the necessary experience to
do a proper war-time job with masses of
brown-brother from all districts.
In Papua, where civil insubordination is
rife, one essential in some parts is a sound
knowledge of Motuan. This cannot be
obtained in “a short time,” any more
than the complicated New Guinea pidgin,
knowledge of which is vital to contact
with the native mind, can be obtained in
the same period.
Civilian whites going back to New
Guinea and Fapua complain that their
boys were utterly spoilt, but received their
return with transports of joy after their
long contact with the official mind.
There were, of course, plenty of ex-
perienced World War I Diggers available
for the control of New Guinea battalions,
to whom in some cases the authorities in
the end were compelled to hand over lest
worse befall. But this was a last resource.
It is a basic principle of “Labor” policy
that the only people capable of managing
the native are those who have never seen
one except in the pictures.
This type of controller is apt to imagine
in a few weeks that he knows the native
mind; and the native is diligent to per-
suade him that he is right.
However, by recent appointments, in
New Guinea particularly, the Ward-
Fordes are proving that they have realised
(perhaps too late) the extent of their
failures.

PERSONAL ITEMS
With the decision of Arthur Claude
Moore to swap a Government boss for a
private one the Commonwealth Public
Service loses one of its ablest administra-
tors. Moore joined the Customs in 1916,
but at 19 was away with the 7th Light
Horse in Palestine. Returning to the de-
partment he became in a few years one
of its most trusted and dependable men.
With Stanley Bruce and Harry Gullett
he took part in the negotiations for the
Ottawa Agreement in 1932 and two years
later accompanied the Latham Goodwill
Mission to Asia and the Indies. Two
trips to Europe followed, and when war
and Lease-Lend came he was put in charge
of the Division of Import Procurement.
Last year he was appointed director-
general of Australian War Supplies Pro-
curement in Washington, and since the
end of the war has been engaged on the
job of winding-up Lease-Lend. He’s 48.
Writing of Harold Williams’s farewell
concert'' at Sydney Town Hall—the singer
has left to carry out engagements in
Britain and America—Neville Cardus
commented that in singing the death scene
from “Boris Godounov” he made the part
“even on a concert platform in
a boiled shirt.” Had the critic heard
Williams render the same piece a week
or so earlier he would have been even
more impressed by the singer’s ability to
triumph over difficult surroundings. The
occasion was a farewell luncheon given
him by Sydney Savage Club; the scene
a George-street restaurant. In a smoke-
filled atmosphere Willianas had to compete
with the clatter of dishes from the servery,
a continual stream of waitresses juggling
cups of coffee and the intermittent ping
of a cash register. Up from the street
below surged the clamor of passing trams
and the incidental music of a pneumatic
drill, yet Williams managed to infuse into
the difficult part all the dramatic inten-
sity it requires. A World War I Digger,
Williams had previously been a railway-
man, but found his voice in France,
studied and worked in England when
peace came and developed into one of
the finest concert-platform and oratorio
baritones in Britain.
Albert Denzil Hill, retired g.m. of
Adelaide Steamship, had been with
the company for close on half a
century—at Adelaide first, then at
Fremantle, Townsville and Sydney
before returning to his home State
and climbing by way of the account-
ant’s desk to the secretary’s chair and
thence, in 1942, to the general-manager’s.
In recent years Adelaide has seen less of
Hill than Melbourne and Sydney, where
his knowledge of the shipping industry,
his keen brain and tolerant human quali-
ties have won him wide respect. Guy
Packard, manager of Sydney branch for
12 years, takes over the reins.
William Alexander Dargie, new dir-
ector of the National Gallery art school
in Melbourne in succession to William
Rowell, has won an almost continuous
series of art awards since he was
given a send-off blessing by Max Meldrum
at his first show in Melbourne: the
Woodward and McPhillimy Awards, the
Mac Kay Prize, the Bendigo Gallery
Prize and the Archibald Prize —
twice. Dargie’s portrait of George Pearce
was accepted for King’s Hall, Canberra ;
he was an official artist in the Middle
East, Burma and New Guinea; he
painted General MacArthur—the portrait
is to hang in the National! War
Museum —and he has, enough offi-
cial political portrait commissions to
last-a Rembrandt for a lifetime. A clever
painter of the conventional school, he is
still in his early thirties.
Coleman Kain, Chief Traffic Inspector
of S.A. Police Force, has retired from the
service. Last January he received the
King’s Police Medal for “long and dis-
tinguished service” —in his case 35 years.
During his career he was concerned in
clearing up many major criminal cases
in the course of which he received several
honorable mentions. Ten years ago he
was transferred to the Traffic Division, of
which he has been chief since 1943.
Most formal farewells are dull affairs,
but there was a genuine country atmos-
phere and heartiness about the gathering
at Sydney Trocadero in honor of Jos.
Evans, retiring after more than fifty-years’
service with Dalgety’s wool department.
Evans has chased wool all over N.S.W.,
and has friends in all parts of the State,
some of whom travelled hundreds of
miles to wish him a happy retirement.
After his friends had given between-
them quite a slab of the country’s history
Jos, said the appropriate things with the
right jocoseness, interlaid with some more
weighty material. He remarked that
country people had a quality unusual
these days—the gift of stability. And he
glanced, in passing, at the ludicrous posi-
tion in Australia, a country which could,
and should, be producing goods for an
undernourished world.

he caused by singing “Ol’ Man River”

out recently with an attack on traditional
methods, of teaching English in the
schools. He urged the abolition of all
classes in formal grammar, more emphasis
on reading and the addition of a course
in logic. In his younger days the new
Judge was a prolific and facile writer of
topical verse and, given sufficient en-
couragement and the right atmosphere,
he can still occasionally be persuaded to
declaim some verses in which he expressed
the anguished feelings of thirsty Adelai-
dians when Six O’clock Closing first hit
the city. Coventry seems to have caught
him at a mometit when nostalgic
memories of those days were momen-
tarily assailing the judicial mind.
“Si Anu”: Frank Athelstane Swetten-

before the last war, he was more than an
official. He studied the Malay from
within, wrote an important dictionary of
his language and was the author of a
number of books on Malaya which are
still worth reading. His death at 96 is
another testimonial to the enervating
effects of the tropics.

Dental Science at Melbourne Uni. since
1944, and lectures there in dental em-
bryology and histology and' other
branches of his subject. He practised in
Caulfield.
Arrived in Christchurch, M.L., to take
over the professorship of Physics at
Canterbury University College, Dr. F. C,
"Chalklin, leading British authority on soft
X-rays, which are the radiations between
X-rays and ultra-violet rays. Most of his
work in this field has been done in
Sweden under Professor Siegbahn. Dr.
Chalklin graduated in science with honors
in physics at London University in 1923.
In 1939 he was appointed Reader at
London University.
There are very few musicians with a
more sensitive approach to his subject
than the Rev. Percy Jones, the little
cleric who is head of Catholic music in
Victoria. Born in Geelong, he showed
his talent early, and a scholarship took
him to Rome, where he studied the
church music which has a tradition
stretching back beyond the Middle Ages.
He returned with a special degree from
the Papal College, and since then has
beep responsible for the musical side of
most Catholic performances in Mel-
bourne. At a reception to De Valera in
Rome he met the President of Eire.
Although there were all the big guns of
diplomacy from France, Russia, Poland,
Germany and Britain present the Irish-
man, who has a great love of music,
passed them all by to talk music with the
Australian.
Died in Dunedin three months after
resigning from the editorial chair of the
oldest newspaper in Maoriland, the Otago
“Daily Times,” James Hutchison was
79 at the finish. He first trod the
Inky Way 60 years ago, and for
37 years he was editor of the “D.T.”
Tom Bracken introduced him to jour-
nalism.
An authority on production planning
visiting this country under the wing of
the Secondary Industries Commission, E.
A. (“Bert”) Weston was Director of
Technical Manpower in the English Mid-
lands during the war years. He’s an
engineer and a doubly qualified Cockney,
born not only within the sound of Bow
Bells, but less than half a mile from the
Bull and Bush. In an address to Syd-
ney Legacy Club he told of a dear old
soul who, during an air raid, insisted on
rummaging round in the ruins of her
house looking for her daughter’s false
teeth. One of Bert’s fellow-wardens,
tired of trying to coax the old lady back
to the shelter, said, “Look, Mother. Tell
your daughter Jerry’s dropping bombs,
not buns.”
Doing a grand job in Mildura (Vic.) is
A. W. (“Nicky”) Barr, D.F.C. and bar,
ex-p.-0.-w. escapee, wing-commander over
France on D-Day and a member of the
Australian Rugby Union team that
reached England after war broke out.
“Nicky” is now secretary of the Mildura
Development League, inveigling indus-
tries to the Murray town of winter sun-
shine. Owing greatly to his efforts, Mil-
dura is now certain of its university
college in the old Aerodrome Buildings, a
wonderful achievement surely for a city
carved out of semi-aridity.
“S.T.S.”: Oxford and (to a much less
degree) Cambridge get a solid batch of
undergrads from S.A. this year. Anglican
Bishop Robin sends three sons. Grenfell
Price, head of St. Mark’s College
and former M.H.R., sends two sons
and a nephew, all to his old col-
lege, Magdalen (Oxford), where go
also a son of Collier Cudmore, M.L.C.,
and a son of S.A, Industrial Court presi-
dent Morgan. The same college gets also
three of the four Rhodes Scholars from
S.A., Blackburn, Wells, Gough and Piper,
who have accumulated during the war.
Old-time Bulletin contributor James
Francis Dwyer has returned to his home
at Pau, the capital of Basses-Pyrenees
(France), whence he went back to
America when the Germans invaded
France. It is 40 years since Dwyer, now
72, left Australia to try his fortunes over-
seas. Born at Camden (N.S.W.), he com-
menced the battle for a crust at an early
age and received encouragement from
J. F. Archibald, who published his first
writings. Not long after leaving these
parts he was making his thousand a year
from short stories, mostly adventure and
mystery yarns after the fashion of the
“thriller.” Upon going back to Pau, he
found his villa intact and his property
undamaged. His neighbors had stored in
their own homes his most precious posses-
sions. They returned the day he arrived 40
bottles of whisky, 30 of gin and a large
quantity of wine he had left behind ; not
a bottle had been broaclied. Pau, said
Dwyer, had not been damaged, and, ex-
cept for little pathetic plaques that tell
where resisters had been shot or hanged,
there was little evidence of Nazi occupa-
tion.
Into the silence:
In Sydney, at 70, Clarence Duncan Mclntyre,
former secretary of St. George District Hos-
pital. A North Coast man, he was for 25
years secretary of Alsfonville Co-op. Butter and
was a founder of the Primary Producers’ Union.
Before taking over St. George he was secre-
tary of Dungog and Maitland Hospitals.
In Pt. Lincoln (S.A.), at 87, Archdeacon
H. W. L. Snow, a mighty worker for the
Church of England on Eyre Peninsula since he
migrated there from Christchurch (M.L.) in
1912. .
In Sydpey, at 67, George Allan More, mining
engineer. As engineer, surveyor, manager and
consultant he had worked on gold, silver-lead,
iron, tin, copper and coal properties in Aus-
tralia, Maoriland, New Guinea, Borneo,
Malaya, Sumatra and Siam. As a young man
he was prominent in football, rowing and
boxing circles. Singleton was his birthplace, but
any place with a mineral deposit attracted him
like a magnet.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
It looked as though everybody you
knew was at the Medical Society’s
Diamond Jubilee Ball last week. From
the glimpse of Mrs. C. L. Jones (positively
yards and yards of brown taffeta in the
full and soft skirt of her frock) and Mrs.
Poate, sitting together on the conversation
seat in the foyer in the shade of a cluster
of red and white palms, to the Tom
Batemans’ table up near the bandstand
about a mile of floorage away the Troca-
dero was crowded with Sydney’s well-
knowns. To the towering red candle on
the official table Sydney’s social moths
had fluttered, and the tables were packed
so closely together it was sometimes hard
for a hostess to know where her own
party began or ended.
Aesculapius, that dear old pet snake of
medicine, flung a warning gaze on the
assemblage from the bandstand. “Liquor
tonight, liver tomorrow, boys! ” it seemed
to hiss. At each end of the hall there
were enormous posters showing medicine
from the dark ages to the present age of
electricity cuts. On the official table at
which Professor and Mrs. Harold Dew
presided, there was in addition to the
high red candle a three-tiered cake, white
and red frosted, the work of Mrs. Berge.
As the band played on frocks of pre-
war lustre went into action. Mrs. C. G.
Macdonald’s black marquisettes were dia-
mante and sequin spattered. Mrs. Tom
Bateman’s magnolia satins swept out their
folds to show here and there a pink or
black centred satin rose. Another graceful
wearer of pearly satins was Mrs. M.
Munro. The Chancellor of the University,
knight Charles Blackburn, was there and a
company of professors and their wives.
The Bertie Schlinks were there. Eric
Sussman, the John Belisarios, Mrs, A. J.
Collins, with doctor son lan and his
fiancee, and a medical student son of the
brilliant and too-early-dead Dr. John
Hunter, the Jo Coens, Mrs. Coen wearing
an old lace shawl with her black moire
frock, were a few of the many.
Sydney’s most stirring show last week
was the departure for England of H.M.S.
Victorious with 700 Australian wives of
British servicemen aboard. Hours before
the ship sailed the road outside the wharf
was dense with relatives and friends.
Aboard the carrier the brides made
an animated display, as they lined
the flight deck, sat astride guns, clustered
in turrets or peered from portholes.
Shouted messages were mostly drowned in
the general din, so some conversed in
deaf and dumb language or semaphored
messages with their arms. Mostly the
brides were amazingly young.
Some of the crew arrived after the
gangplank had been lifted, and came
aboard in nets or by crane. One of the
lads, his face printed with lipstick, carried
a huge bouquet and sang “Shenandoah.”
The skipper is Capt. J. C. Annes-
ley, who once commanded H.M.S. Enter-
prise and until recently was chief staff
officer at Gibraltar. He holds a 1914-18
war D. 5.0., the Croix de Guerre and the
Royal Norwegian Order of St, Olav. As
the streamers snapped snatches of songs
could be heard, among them the “Maori’s
Farewell,” “Waltzing Matilda” and “Bell-
bottomed Trousers.” Only then did
many of the girls aboard start to weep.
Todd Duncan has an exciting voice. It
has cymbals and drums in it as well as
organ-like sonority. He got off to a good
start on Saturday night when a crowded
Town Hall almost cheered hiS opening
“Hear Me, Ye Winds and Waves.” In
spite of the transport difficulties music-
lovers turned up, many of them dressed
to glory. One catch of ermine, almost
ankle length, and probably worth the
weight of the Kremlin in roubles, kept
its wearer snug against the chill of the
radiator-less hall. Mrs. Ernest Lashmar’s
taffetas held the tones of deep-red chry-
santhemums. The Harald Bowdens were
there. The H. J. Bradys were enthusiasts.
Her frock of vellum taffeta was splashed
with deep-blue flowers of great size. Her
sandals were gold and blue. It was an
occasion from the broadcast before the
concert to the last request encore, “01’
Man River.”
Poinsettia trailed its red glory along
every table in the Trocadero on the night
of the Fourth of July Ball. That and the
bandstand turned into a little parkland
of greenery hemmed in with low white
pickets (no, nothing to do with strikes,
just fencing) were the most pictorial of
the decorations. The tall Uncle Sam
at the entrance to the ballroom and the
bunting were symbolic ; so was America’s
flag expressed in flowers, the centre-piece
of the official table where sat U.S. Consul-
General Earle Russell and his wife. There
also were the office bearers of the Ameri-
can Society, which had organised the
ball. Premier McKell and his daughter
Betty. Mrs. ,Wame, whose husband is

and second parts of the programme with
the romance of ba n et . Cyril Ritchard
and j^ ad g e £Hiott were wildly applauded
for the den scenb from “Shadow

together
This ‘is pretty Ann Richards, who
made her first app earances in film work
with C inesound, and is now steadily
climbing to fame in Hollywood. Ann is
a Sydney girl and sin ce her return has
been staying with mother in their Neutral
Bay home Anrlj who has just turned the
20-mark, is a living contradiction of the
Chinese proverb which says the almonds
of life come to men when they no longer
have the teeth to crunch them. Ann is
savoring her almonds to the full. She
gave her home town a chance to hear
her in the broadcast of “Romeo and
Juliet,” when she was the Juliet of those
immortal “star-crossed” lovers.
Soprano Joan Hammond was given a
party by Lord Mayor Bartley and the Lady
Mayoress midway through last week. In
the closing dusk of a winter after-
noon the guests poured in to Joan.
She has been away from Sydney for 10
years, and everybody was recalling her
farewell concert in the Town Hall.
Pianist Frank Hutchens and Mrs. Harold
Bott talked over the first tour Joan made ;
that was with a small concert group
arranged by Frank, They toured Tas-
mania. Miss Jobson, who was head-
mistress at P.L.C., Pymble, in the singer’s
schooldays there, recalled how she had
studied German lieder at Hopewood
House when Miss Jobson was its prin-
cipal, Mrs. Hammond was there, very
pleased with her daughter’s success.
Pianist Trixie Tange (Mrs. H. Evans) and
her husband brought their greetings.
Trixie’s hat had a blue plume on the
crown. She proclaimed that the blue
plume had once been a fan. A-closely-
fitting toque of kingfisher-blue feathers
was worn by Mrs. Harold Bott, in com-
pany with black frock and silver fox
furs. The Hope Gibsons were there; so
were the Charles Moses couple and the
A.B.C.’s chief, R. J. F. Boyer.
The Girl in the Flat Opposite says her
aunt now calls it the “Family Herald,”
From Melbourne
“Old Glory” flew from one of the towers
of the Town Hall in honor of the “Glori-
ous Fourth,” while in the Lower Town
Hall a luncheon given by the Australia-
America Friendship League also cele-
brated the day. President of the Associa-
tion, R. G. Casey, received the official
guests and proposed the toasts of
King George and President Truman.
Two hundred guests listened to the speech
by L. G. Hartnett, an Englishman who
has lived in this country for 12 years. He
stressed the need for friendship between
“two proud and independent peoples,” and
as he read extracts from the Declaration
of Independence Mr. Hartnett said
“what we want now is a declaration of
dependence—upon each country!” Mrs.
R. G. Casey was at the official table,
neatly tailored in grey and with a grey
hat topped with a self-toned rose. The
Hon. Mrs. Ronald Douglas came with
her brother, Admiral Sir Louis Hamilton ;
other official guests included Lt.-General
V. A. P. Sturdee and General Tom
Blarney. Consul-General for U.S.A.,
Richard Boyce, who responded on behalf
of his country, was with Mrs. Boyce.
Vice-president of the Association, Wesley
Ince, was accompanied by his wife, whose
mink coat covered her ensemble of leaf
brown.
Among the many parties given on the
eve of Grand National none was
brighter than the one given at Blyths-
wood, home of Lady Syme. With Mrs.
Edgar Rouse as co-hostess 200 young
guests danced and made merry. Party
was in honor of Veronica, daughter of
Lady Syme, and Julia Mary Rouse,
daughter of Mrs. Edgar Rouse, whose
portrait by Dorothy Welding looks out
at you here. For the party Julia Mary
wore a black taffeta frock cut on bouffant
lines.
The reception-rooms were a floral para-
dise, while the ballroom mantelpiece was
banked with scarlet and white camellias
mixed with green hydrangeas. Lady
Syme wore a gown of black satin with
wide shoulder-straps of diamente which
continued to the waistline and finished
with tasselled ends. Mrs, Rouse chose a
frock of black crepe, featuring side
draperies finished with a floral design in
colorful sequins. Veronica was frocked
in stiff white corded silk with a wide satin
stripe, the bodice featuring an off-the-
shoulder line and finished with short puff
sleeves. White gardenias were worn
across the back of her hair and matched
her shoulder posy. Peggy Austin and
Jennifer Haggard wore white, adding
pale-blue satin sashes and Alice in Won-
derland hair ribands. Bernice Willis’s
frock was of pastel-blue crepe; Angela
Sturt set off her gold locks with an aqua-
green slim-fitting frock, the deep neck-
line banded in colored sequins. Quite
a number of the young girls favored the
upswept hair-do. Petite Eleanor Wilbur
Ham chose cherry net for her frock and
pinned small bunches of cherries in her
hair. Newly-married Jackie Deasey, who
came with husband Dennison, chose a
backless gown of white satin highlighted
with gold lamd trimmings. Among the
young male escorts were Geoffrey Hag-
gard, still in the R.A.N., lan Rowan,
Alan Swinburne, Randal Deasey, William
Stoyles and Frank Fogarty.
At the Grand National meeting there
was a definite trend towards the glamor
of pre-war days, but hats stole the show.
They were individual, of all shapes, sizes
and colors. The bobby and bonnet shapes
were chosen by young racegoers, and,
when they frame a young and pretty face,
are most attractive. Flower-bedecked
hats, small and large, were worn a lot
with tailored suit or coat. On this drab
and dismal day, with a bitter wind whist-
ling across Flemington’s flat, the flower
hats supplied all the warmth and color.
One smart woman, suited in navy, chose
a large matching felt hat, and on the flat
brim massed field flowers. The trend
towards more color in dressing was also
seen in a lime-green suit highlighted with
a bright cerise hat. Well suited for the
occasion was Janet Bowen Pain in her
Harris tweed suit checked in blue and
fawn, with a matching full-length cape.
With her three-quarter length mink coat,
Mrs. Edmund Kurtz wore a small brown
velvet Dutch bonnet; her fur-topped rain
boots were envied by many women race-
goers.
Snuggling into fur coats were Mrs.
Gordon Fuller, whose gay little ribbon
hat was worn with a dyed-ermine coat;
Mrs. Lionel Newton, who topped her
mink coat with a high-crowned brown felt
hat—she was accompanied by her sister,
Mrs. Frank Rago, of San Francisco ; and
Mrs. Harold Rabling, in a silver fox
coat and small flower-laden hat. Joy
Langford’s high-crowned brown felt hat
matched her tailored coat. Mrs. Sam
Hordern chose a coat and matching hat
of nutria fur ; with her was another Syd-
ney visitor, Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere, who
was suited in heather mauve tweed. Tas-
manian visitors included Marie Hoare, in
a dyed ermine coat and small matching
hat, and Nell Stokes smart in black suit
and small flower-trimmed hat. Gwen Mol-
lard looked out under cyclamen veiling
which swathed her black hat.
When Ann Richards arrived by
’plane from Sydney she was greeted
by air-hostess Pat Manton with a lovely
bouquet of roses, orchids and violets.
Later Ann was guest of honor at a
cocktail party given at Menzies by Capt.
and Mrs. Ivan Holyman, The hostess,
like many of the women guests, favored
black, but with the ever-present flower
hat giving zest to a sombre ensemble.
Mrs. Richards, who accompanied her
daughter, was also a guest who chose a
floral top piece. Also there to greet the
film star were Capt. and Mrs. Haig, the
latter departing from the flower mode
in favor of a fur toque, which matched
her fur coat. Capt. Francis was with
Mrs. Francis, whose rose-trimmed hat
was worn with a black frock.
Joan Hammond was guest of honor at
a morning tea party given by the Lord
Mayor, Cr. Connelly, and Lady Mayoress,
Mrs. Bernard Heinze. Cr. H. L. Lyall,
with Mrs. Lyall, and Cr. W. C. L. Towns-
end and his wife and representatives of
the A.B.C. were among the guests.
“Carry Me Back to Old Virginny”
could have been the theme song of the
Fourth of July Ball, for which members
of the American Women’s Auxiliary for
the Children’s Hospital worked so hard.
Capturing the mood of the colorful, lazy
days of the old South, the stage was set
with a hunting scene. Most striking note
was the life-sized model of a huntsman,
complete with pink coat and top hat,
astride a dapple-grey horse, in the flower
garden of a negro cabin. At the other
end of the ballroom of the St. Kilda Town
Hall was the official enclosure, trans-
formed into the dining-room of one of
Virginia 4 s stately homes. In the foyer
12 beautifully-gowned Southern belles
acted as usherettes.
Gowns scintillated with trimmings of
gold, and sequins trimmed many frocks. l
Mrs. T. Eardley Wilmot, a member of
the auxiliary, chose garnet-toned crepe
trimmed with sequins in the same warm
shade. Ann Richards came to the ball at
the end of the “Smithy” premiere. She
pinned orchids .in her hair and under her
mink coat wore a gown of white tulle.
Honiton lace, edged with pearls, fashioned
the yoke of the fitted bodice encrusted
at the neckline with diamente embroi-
deries. Muriel Steinbeck was another
guest; she wore a lacquer-red Mandarin
jacket, embroidered in gold thread in a
scroll design, over a white evening gown.
Mrs. George Mendes’s gown was of ice-
blue satin, diamente-embroidered.
Among Edward Heffernan’s pictures
which were recently shown at George’s
Gallery were portraits of well-known
Melbourne women. They were the sub-
ject of much admiration, and so was the
speech made by Rohan Rivett as he de-
clared the show open. Confessing his
lack of artistic knowledge, the speaker
deplored the fact that no patron of this
branch of the Arts had busied himself in
creating a fund to send promising young
artists abroad for further study. Mrs.
Edward Heffernan was hostess at an
afternoon-tea after the opening, and Mrs.
lan Potter, whose portrait adorned the
walls of the Gallery, added to the bright-
ness of the scene by donning a white hat,
the crown filled in with glowing red roses,
as a contrast to her black frock. Mrs.
Dudley Ward also chose a flower-laden
hat to offset her ensemble, Reta Findlay,
one of George’s directors, was not present
at the opening, for she had left for Eng-
land on a business trip. Robert Haines,
director of the Gallery, who has just re-
turned from Sydney, promises Melbourne
folk an exhibition of the works of Sydney
artists shortly.

After deducting goodwill, etc., and allowing for
difference between cost and par value shares in
subsidiaries.
Expansion and change in ownership from
chiefly English to predominantly Aus-
tralian —technical affiliations have riot
been affected—-have been the outstanding
features of this enterprising organisation,
in which the public became interested in
1936, two years after the present holding
co. fused in one control the activities of
Electricity Meters and Manufacturing
Co. and New System Telephones. Now
there are 18 subsidiaries in the group,
which covers a wide field of industrial
activity. And, more important, most of
the units are old-established concerns
enjoying an extensive goodwill. Manu-
factures include electricity meters, switch-
gear, radios, fractional horsepower
motors, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners,
washing machines, plastics, cutlery, petrol
and other pumps, air-conditioning equip-
ment and all kinds of gas and hot-water
appliances.
Failure of earnings to keep step with
development since 1939 reflects the impact
of war. Practically the whole group
turned to production of munitions and
other war equipment. This meant re-
organisation of works and plant, and
creation of an entirely new set-up. The
units engaged on low-profit margin de-
fence work were those which, in peace-
time, contributed most to revenue. How-
ever, the prefs. regularly received their
full contract rate, the ord. div. eased only
H points (from 7 \ p.c. to 6 p.c.), and there
were satisfactory margins. Paid capital
advanced from £571,218 at end 1939 to
£865,352 at the close of 1945, mainly by
exchange of scrip in purchase of cos.
absorbed as subsidiaries.
With the end of war another complete
re-organisation of works and plant and re-
construction of their layout became neces-
sary, this time to enable resumption of
manufacture of civilian goods by efficient
mass-production methods. And no time
has been lost in getting on with the job.
Chief obstacles have been shortage of raw
materials and interruption of production
through stoppages on the coalfields and
at Bunnerong, Sydney’s big power-station.
To help the work along the public quickly
subscribed £150,000 of 4 p.c. debenture
money early last term. And during the
year anew subsidiary, Air Control Equip-
ment Pty., was formed and more shares
were bought in W. T. Carmichael Pty.,
which has now become a subsidiary.
Net earnings of the group were £4825
better ,at £66,769, or enough to pay the
pref. div. and show 7.9 p.c. on average
ord. capital as against 7.5, 7, 6.2, 6.7, 9.8
and 14.5 p.c. back to 1939. The reserves
(£114,129) are arrived at after deducting
goodwill, etc, and excess cost
of shareholdings over their par value,
which accounts for the year’s net reduc-
tion of £44,765 in reserves.
Since the close of accounts the co. has
' taken over the Commonwealth munitions
factory at Orange (N.S.W.), together with
a quantity of machine tools, plant and
equipment, for the purpose of turning out
electric motors, refrigerators and washing-
machines. Over 1000 people will be em-
ployed here when production gets into
full swing. The co. has also purchased
from Parkinson and Cowan, Ltd, (Lon-
don), three manufacturing concerns which
have been established in Australia for
many years—Parkinson, Cowan (A’sia)
Pty. (gas meters, etc.), Parkinson Stove
Cos. (Aust.) Pty. (gas stoves, etc.), and
Hugh Hartford Pty. (hot-water appli-
ances). The purchase price was £370,115,
satisfied by the issue of 248,817 f.-p.
£1 ords.

Movements in the figures last term reflect
acquisition of new subsidiaries already
referred to and expanding trade activity.
The improved cash holding was due to
sale of Government securities and receipt
of debenture money. The more or less
liquid surplus (£617,932) was £97,310 less
than at the previous balance.
On the market the ords. are jammed at

The board celebrated the co.’s' 50th
anniversary by handing shareholders an
extra 2\ p.c., making 10 p.c. for the year,
half of which was paid from a tax-free
reserve. It used to be Coghlan and Tul-
loch s Ballarat Brewing Cos., formed in
1895 to weld the then 40-year-old interests
of Magill and Coghlan and of Tulloch
and Son. The name was changed to the
present less cumbersome title in 1911, and
the public became interested in 1936,
when the scrip was listed. The brewery
is at Ballarat (Vic.), and the business ex-
tends throughout western Victoria and
over the border to Mt. Gambier (S.A.) and
to the N.S.W. Riverina,
During the war, service demands helped
to offset the effects of beer rationing and
lifts in taxation and other costs. The
contraction in the 1944 and 1945 figures
was due mainly to movement of troops
from the area which the co. serves. Last
term there was a steady return of popu-
lation to this area, owing to demobilisa-
tion, and demand for the co.’s brew
strengthened again. The improvement
m gross earnings was £29,218:

Rents, etc., from the co.’s 91 hotels and
other investments were down £1438, and
the brisker business was handled at an
extra cost of £12,838. Allowing for re-
serve adjustments in the previous term

(x. 38,269) was enough to pay the pref.
div. and show 12.3 p.c. on the £250,000
of ord. capital as against 10.1, 11.2, 13.8
9.4, 10.8, 13.2 and 17.4 p.c. back to
1939. So nothing had to be strained in
order to lift the div. from 7± p.c. to
10 p.c., making the average rate of dis-
tribution over the last 30 years a shade
over 10 p.c.
Unless something unexpected happens,
prospects of the 10 p.c. being maintained
are encouraging. Completion of demobili-
sation will further strengthen population
in the co.’s area. Beer rationing ceased
in March last, but owing to shortage of
raw materials (barley and hops) the
breweries continue to adhere to the
official quota until their output can be
stepped up, which ought to be possible
by the time the thirsty summer months
arrive. A speculative feature of brewery
and hotel business in Victoria is the
eight-yearly licensing poll. The majority
against abolition increased from 56.5 p.c,
in 1930 to 65.7 p.c. in 1938. To carry
abolition a favorable majority of at least
three-fifths of the voters in the State is
required.

Transition from the war-time swings to
the peace-time roundabouts has caused
no disturbance to earnings of this enter-
prising 25-year-old Australian fire, marine
and accident office. The sharp reduction
in marine war-risk rates has been largely
offset by improvement in the volume of
merchant tonnage available for ordinary
trade purposes, and by quicker turn-
abouts compared with the slow-moving
war-time convoy system. With the revival
of private building the volume of fire
premiums has begun to strengthen, and so
has income from motor vehicle insurance,
owing to the greater number of cars, etc.,
on the road, following an increased supply
of petrol. And income from these sources
can be expected to grow until supply over-
takes an accumulated demand. Also,
several of the co.’s 18 Asiatic and island
agencies, which folded up owing to the
Jap invasion, are already in operation
again, and others are expected to resume
business at an early date.
Following loss of the agencies just re-
ferred to more ginger was put into the
hunt for contracts in the Middle East,
India'and elsewhere. New business from
these recently-established connections
(notably Palestine) contributed hand-
somely to last term’s premium income
(£542,940, down £2981), of which less was
re-insured (£188,641, down £14,799), thus
enabling the co. to show £ll,Blß more

The sharpening of competition and re-
habilitation of ex-service personnel were
mainly responsible for bumping up the
expense- rate by £2 6s. p.c. But there was
a saving of £3 Bs. p.c. in the loss rate,
which was one of the best in the co.’s
history. That left the underwriting sur-
plus £lOls stronger at £32,815, or 19.2
p.c. on capital. Interest and rents turned
in £13,428 (up £1594) net, equal to 7.8 p.c.
on capital. The net result from all sources
(£46,243, up £2609) was thus 27 p.c. on
capital as against 21.7, 24.4, 30.1, 29.3,
19.5, 21 and 18.6 p.c. back to 1939. Half
a point was added to the div., making it
9 p.c., and it is doubtful whether better
need be looked for for a while. Interest
and rents provided all but £2BB of the div.
requirement, leaving practically the whole
of the underwriting surplus available to
swell investments and returns therefrom.
In December last 2s. 6d, a share was
called on 200,350 of the contribs,, making

King Island Scheelite, N.L.
The new 20,000-ton-a-month mill,
which cost £342,062, started up in Nov.,
1945, but failed, mechanically and metal-
lurgically, to do what it was originally
designed to do. The coarse-ore bin and
crushing plant have been unable to cope
with sticky fines during the wet winter
months, thus affecting the crushing rate;
the flotation section to handle gravity
slimes began to operate successfully only
a month or so ago; the second-hand
power units had to be curtailed to 80 p.c.
of their full rating, and one of the ball
mills had to be closed down; and effi-
ciency of some of the power shovels and
trucks fell short of expectations, too.
It all meant smaller - than - planned
throughput at higher cost. For the year
to end Oct. last 84,443 tons overburden,
20,296 c.y. sand, and 5162 tons waste
rock, etc., were removed, and 91,193 tons
ore was sent to the mill. Treatment
figures were:

48 „ „ 0ct.,’45.. 89,518 434.2
The first period resulted in a loss. Things
improved after plant adjustments were
completed and managing-director Bruhn
took charge in March, 1945. The con-
centrates, assaying 67.26 p.c. WO3, were
sold under contract to the Government
at £5 10s. per unit. Gross earnings were
£160,961. Mining and realisation ran
away with £109,187, and sundries £13,660.
That left £38,114, of which interest on
Government loan to June 2, 1945, took
£16,116. The remaining £20,998 was
41.9 p.c. on capital. No div. was paid,
because money is wanted to buy new
power plant, expected to cost £45,000,
and for other purposes, including working
capital, owing to delay in receipts from
open market sales —the Government con-
tract ran out on Feb. 15 last.
What the future holds for the co. it is
difficult to say. The American market is
the most favorable at the moment-
present nominal price per unit WO3 is
$24 c.i.f., less $8 duty—and arrangements
have been made with a U.S. firm to refine
and sell the co.’s concentrates, which have
a high molybdenum content. But until
industry generally settles down to steady
production again demand is likely to
fluctuate, and so is the price. The co.'s
biggest problem is how to reduce costs.
Stepping up production to plant capacity
has been suggested; but this means
major alterations and adjustments, and
heavy capital outlay, which the co. is not
in a position to meet at the moment, with-
out asking shareholders or others for
more. Meanwhile, the board has asked
the Commonwealth Government for a
substantial “reduction” of its loan, with
a view to reconstruction of the co.
Enough ore, assaying 0.75 p.c. WO3, has
been proved to keep the mill going for
another five years on a throughput of
250,000 tons p.a.
When the books closed there were cash,
debtors’ balances and concentrates on
hand totalling £46,942 to meet current
liabilities of £30,007. The mine figured at
£135,998, old plant £3357, new miU
£342,062, housing £36,413, and stocks and
stores £34,761. The loan from the Gov-
ernment stood at £440,185. It is repay-
able out of future profits, which are divi-
sible in proportion to the amount of loan
money and share capital invested in the
undertaking. Paid capital is £52,500.
Westralian Mines Department proposes
to set up a training course in geology,
similar to that established in Ontario,
Canada, if sufficient prospectors are
willing to enroll. The purpose of the
course, which is to consist of 16 weekly
lectures, will be to give a broad under-
standing of the fundamentals of geology,
mineral deposits and prospecting pos-
sibilities. Assistance to prospectors by
way of technical information, assays, etc.,
is already given by the Mines Depart-
ment in the West.

of gold values near the co.’s eastern

full extent of these occurrences has be-
gun. A series of deep boreholes is to
be put down in other parts of the mine.

In the Kalgurli block No. 6 level work-
ings 36.8dwt. values were obtained.
Mining in other parts of the co.’s property
resulted in payable ore being opened up.

AUSTRALIAN MUTUAL
PROVIDENT SOCIETY
97th ANNUAL MEETING
Held on 7th June, 1946
CHAIRMAN’S SPEECH
Ladies and Gentlemen:
As this is the first Annual Meeting of the
Society that has been held since the victorious
conclusion of the Second World War, I wish
to take the opportunity, before reviewing the
results of the past year, briefly to outline the
effect that conditions during that period have
had upon the Society’s business. We are proud
of the manner in which this Society was able
to assist the national war effort, mainly in Aus-
tralia and New Zealand. We can also be
thankful that despite the strain borne by the
Society’s organisation during the last six years
it faces the future with every prospect of ex-
tending still further the valuable service it pro-
vides.
GOVERNMENT LOANS
From the outbreak of the War to the present
time, the Society subscribed £64 million to
Government loans. This'sum is over £2O mil-
lion in excess of the increase in the Society s
assets during that period, and is evidence of
the fulfilment of the Society’s undertaking
to assist the Governments to the utmost in
the matter of raising War finance. If may be
mentioned that the Society’s undertaking was
a voluntary one given early in the War. In
later years when the Governments placed strict
controls on all financial transactions, and an
embargo on any that did not directly assist the
war effort, the Government loans have been
virtually the only avenues of investment avail-
able for the Society’s funds. It is to be hoped
that these controls will soon be modified so
that industrial, commercial and pastoral under-
takings will once again find conditions favor-
able for the development of their businesses.
By investing a proportion of its funds directly
in loans to such undertakings the Society will
play a useful part in assisting in the recon-
version of the national economy to a prosperous
peace-time basis.
WAR CLAIMS
The Society has paid claims totalling
£4,700,000 to the representatives of policy-
holders whose deaths were due to war service.
Included in this amount is the sum of
£1,700,000 representing payments in respect of
pre-war members who died as a result of
aviation. At the outbreak of the war the Board
voluntarily decided that all policies then in
force should be free of restrictions as to war
service, and this latter amount represents the
extra payments made in accordance with that
decision.
INTEREST RATES
Due to the fact that practically all funds
available for investment in the last six years
have been subscribed to Government loans
bearing interest at 3i p.c. per annum or less,
there has been a steady decline in the rate of
interest realised by the Society on its mean
funds. The rate realised in 1938 was £4 7s. 7d.
per centum, and in 1945 the rate had fallen to
£3 18s. 9d. After deduction of all taxes the cor-
responding net rates were £4 Is, 9d. and
£3 11s. 7d. respectively.
It is hoped that in future the Society will be
able to secure a more varied portfolio of
securities than has recently been the case.
There is a very definite danger that the trend
to lower levels of returns on savings will have
the effect of making thrift unattractive; that is,
there may be a lessening of the urge for
people to forego the immediate use of part
of their income as the return may appear to
be little worth the sacrifice of current needs
and pleasures. ...
Thrift, enterprise and the quality of inde-
pendence which have characterised its people
have brought this country to its present stage
of development. Progress in the future will
depend no less upon these same essential
qualities. Life assurance takes a leading part
in stimulating these sound personal traits, and
in encouraging the self-reliant majority to make
provision for their later needs.
RESERVES
Besides making substantial additions to its
Investment and Contingencies Reserves, and
writing down its Office Premises conservatively,
the Society during the War set up a Special
Reserve of £6,000,000 in the Ordinary Depart-
ment, and at the end of 1944 had a Special
Reserve of almost £1,000,000 in the Industrial
Department.
These Reserves were necessarily set up to
meet contingencies inseparable from the War,
such as added mortality, and changes from
pre-war economic conditions, the extent of
which were unpredictable. As previously men-
tioned the claims arising from the war to date
fall little short of £5,000,000, and though the
Society has been able to meet the strain of its
added war deaths by reducing the bonus rate in
the years in which they occurred, other contin-
gencies arising from changed conditions neces-
sitate the retention and utilisation of these Re-
serves. I refer to the general lowering of
interest rates, and the restriction in and control
of many avenues of investment.
VALUATION BASIS
The Board has decided that the bases of
valuation of policy liabilities shall be
strengthened by altering the anticipated future
net interest rate from 3 p.c. to p.c.
The change with regard to the Industrial De-
partment has been made during the year 1945,
and results in the absorption of about £BOO,OOO
of the Special Reserves of that Department.
As regards the Ordinary Department, the work
connected with the change of valuation basis
has been put in hand, but shortage of staff,
resulting from many officers still being on
national service, has prevented its completion.
The Special Reserves maintained in the Ordi-
nary Department are fully adequate to meet
the increased liability expected to arise from
the change.
NEW BUSINESS
The New Business for 1945 comprised policies
totalling more than £38,700,000 sum assured.
This figure was £6,000,000 in excess of the
previous record established in 1944.
This phenomenal increase in new business is
undoubtedly a reflection of current economic
conditions, under which the volume of money
in the public’s hands greatly exceeds that re-
quired for the purchase of available goods.
However, it is gratifying to see that such large
numbers of the public realise the value of life
insurance, and have placed their contracts with
the Society. Undoubtedly the investment ot
surplus funds in long-term life insurance con-
tracts has a stabilising influence which m
present circumstances is beneficial to the com-
munity as a whole as well as to the individuals
concerned.
A large part of the Society’s new business
continues to come from business institutions,
which are making provision through the Society
for the superannuation of. their employees.
The increasing desire of employers to make
provision, on a contributory basis, for em-
ployees after retirement, and for their depen-
dants after death, is a most progressive develop-
ment in recent years. The Society has special-
ised in this type of business, and the services
and expert advice of its officers are readily
available to any employer who is interested in
instituting such a scheme.
ECONOMY OF MANAGEMENT
The economy with which the Society’s affairs
are administered is evidenced by the fact that
its .expense rates continue to be the lowest
among the Life Offices transacting business in
Australia and New Zealand. The expenses of
management (including commission but exclud-
ing taxes) amounted to 10.42 o.c. 01. the
premium receipts in the Ordinary Department
during 1945, a rate which, notwithstanding the
much greater amount of new business written,
only slightly exceeded the rate of 10.31 p.c.
foi 1944. The co-responding figures for the
Industrial Department were 23.32 p.c. in 1945
and 23.96 p.c. in 1944.
BONUSES TO POLICYHOLDERS
Notwithstanding the considerable sum paid
during the year for War Claims, and the
measures taken to provide for future contin-
gencies, the Actuary’s Report reveals a divisible
cash surplus of over £3,000,000 in the Ordi-
nary Department. This sum will provide rever-
sionary bonuses totalling over £5,000,000, the
amounts allotted to individual policies being
on a scale approximately 15 p.c. in excess of
that used for 1944.
Despite difficulties arising from the absence
of numbers of the Society’s staff on war-service
leave, it is expected that Bonus Certificates will
be sent out to all participating policy-holders
on the 30th June in accordance with pre-war
custom. _
In the Industrial Department the rate of
bonus has been maintained at the same rate as
for 1944, and the divisible cash surplus amounts
to £377,867 providing reversionary bonuses of
about £485,000.
LIFE INSURANCE LEGISLATION
The year 1945 saw the passage by the Com-
monwealth Parliament of the long-promised Act
to provide uniform supervision of life-insurance
companies throughout Australia. The Society
has consistently advocated such a measure, and
has given assistance to the Commonwealth
Government to secure that the Act is the best
possible for Australian conditions. It is grati-
fying to record that the matter was debated
in Parliament on non-party lines, and that
members from both sides of the House com-
mented favorably upon the system pf mutual
life insurance, as operated in Australia by this
Society and similar institutions.
STAFF
I wish to pay a special tribute to the work
of the Society’s staff, both outdoor and in-
door. During the war the Society readily made
available those members of the staff who de-
sired to enlist or who were called to the Ser-
vices. 1760 members of the staff and agents
gave full-time service with the Forces, and
of these 62 gave their lives. To the relatives
and friends of those fallen the Board extends
it's deepest sympathy.
We welcome back all those who have re-
turned to us, and we shall do everything in our
power to assist in their rehabilitation by giving
them special opportunities to acquire the ex-
perience they have missed through prolonged
absence.
The absence of so many of the staff on
national service, and the additional work aris-
ing from the rapidly increasing business of the
Society, have thrown on to the remaining
members of the staff a very great strain indeed,
and the Board makes grateful acknowledgment
of the loyal and efficient manner in which they
have carried on the work of the Society under
great difficulties for so long a period. Unfor-
tunately the return to normal working con-
ditions is proving slower than was anticipated.
There are still more than 250 of our salaried
staff engaged with the Forces, but it is hoped
that their return will not be much longer
delayed and the strain on the staff thereby eased.
OBITUARY
I must refer with the deepest regret to the
loss sustained by the Society through the deatn
last November of the General Manager, Mr.
A. W. Sneddon. Mr. Sneddon joined the
Society’s service at the age of 17 in 1897, ana
after serving in many capacities was appomtea
General Manager in 1934. During the I
years of his General Managership his wor
greatly contributed to the strength and progre.
of the Society.

SUNDRY SHOWS
"THE DANCING YEARS."
Those responsible really shouldn’t have
introduced the Borovansky Ballet into
“The Dancing Years” at His Majesty’s,
Melbourne.
Every time those eager and perfectly-
disciplined young men and maidens burst
in, the derivative but pleasant music loses
its sparkle, the sets look gimcrack, and
Ivor Novello’s story seems more like a
penny novelette than ever. The contrast
makes one realise what an enormous
amount of skill and practice goes into the
ballet.
Nothing comparable can be said of the
acting and singing of Max Oldaker,
Evelyn Gardiner and Viola Wilson,
though perhaps there is really very little
they could do with the vapid story of
the career and complicated love affairs
of an obscure musical genius of the Tyrol.
The show is good enough entertain-
ment of its kind, but there was
a moment when it attained to greatness.
That was when the management carted
off its bizarre scenery, substituted dark
cloths and turned the lights off, and the
Borovanskys and the rest of the collection
started weaving in and out of the
shadows, so that the figures were con-
stantly lost and found as the line is in a
great painting. Momentarily the effect
was unbelievably lovely ; and then some-
body switched the lights on and the
dresses and faces looked ordinary again.
Elizabeth Gaye was charming as an
unsophisticated country damsel.
A Performance Of Hamlet.
John Carlson’s strength in the title role
of “Hamlet” at the Independent Theatre,
North Sydney, lay in his quieter moments
—his asides—when he lowered his lids
and dropped his voice in a subtle, cun-
ning, neurotic way. But when he was
required to speak passionately and loudly
he seemed to lose conviction, becoming
merely irritable and droopy.
These faults were never so obvious as
to detract from the continuity and move-
ment of the play, but they prevented
John Carlson from rising to any sustained
dramatic heights: as another Sydney
actor, Kevin Brennan, did recently in an-
other Shakspearean play. Pamela Brom-
ley-Smith, as Ophelia, very nearly rose
to this high level of art. ITie mad scene
was excellent, but everything about her
earlier appearances seemed merely a pre-
lude to this, too much foreshadowed, as
it were, by her every action.
That garrulous old bore, Polonius, was
well played by Charles Tasman, although
his speech of advice to his son Laertes
was somewhat censored. Owen Wqin-
gott, as Laertes, made a good job of
that robust and impetuous young man.
And John Harrison, as Horatio, was very
good. This actor has played a number of
similar parts and done them all very well,
bringing to the role of courtier or friend
a quiet, unselfconscious tact which is
promising and surprising.
Doris Fitton, as the Queen, seemed
badly cast. The play was well produced,
however, and the general level of acting
was high. Also, as is rare in presenta-
tions of Shakspeare, the language was
clear and comprehensible, with some
accent given to its poetry.
Todd Duncan in Sydney.
Anybody who heard Todd Duncan’s
opening concert at Sydney Town Hall
would want to hear him again. His plat-
form manner, a shade more formal than
Tibbett’s, is warm and natural; his voice
is rich, deep, sometimes a bit harsh ; his
delivery dramatic to the point of fierce-
ness ; his enunciation beautifully distinct.
He sang Schubert and a sentimental
Irish ditty with understanding, but with-
out the undercurrent of melody that gives
such lyrics their greatest charm. The
“Porgy and Bess” songs were common-
place. But in “The Song of the Flea,”
“Danse Macabre” and some negro spiri-
tuals he had something very striking to
say.
Earlier at the Town Hall Solomon gave
as clear, precise and lyrical a piece of
solo work as has been heard in Sydney
for years at a performance of Schumann’s
piano concerto. The fiery Coda which
brings the work to a close would obvi-
ously not have caused the pianist to turn
a hair, even if he had one to turn.
Other Sydney concerts included a fine
farewell recital by Harold Williams, and
Ruth Pearce-Jones’s l singing at the Con.
The soprano dealt delicately with
Brahms and Mozart and added an
appropriate poignancy to a group of
Schumann’s Mignon songs and the
“Kennst Du das Land” of Wolf.
On Art and Cheese.
Art or literary societies founded on a
convivial, democratic, good-fellow basis
seldom do anything of real importance.
Not that there is anything wrong with
conviviality as such, but with beer and
pleasant relaxation in the offing the
Muses are apt to have to take a back
seat.
Present writer speaks with experience,
having in his aspiring youth been a
member of an Adelaide society whose
members met in one another’s houses for
the ostensible purpose of discussing
weighty intellectual problems. The most
important ritual of the evening was
known as a “bumborra,” which meant all
hands putting a bob into a jackpot and
the winner shouting his fellow Socrateses
and Platos at the nearest hostelry until
funds were exhausted. Asa bob would
buy a surprising amount of liquor and
the pubs didn’t close till midnight in those
days, philosophy, metaphysics and
aesthetics didn’t get a look in—though they
served as a perfectly tenable excuse for
an evening’s absence from the domestic
fireside.
This by way of introduction to the ex-
hibition by fellows of the Bread and
Cheese Club’s Art Group at Myer’s, Mel-
bourne. The artistic cheese on offer, one
might say, lacks the tang and animal life
of Gorgonzola.
Exceptions are “Somewhere in Aus-
tralia,” by Robert Hofmann, a well-
rendered landscape; Brian Calcutt’s
watercolor panel which shows some
observation ; “Low Tide,” by W. Pestell;
and two etchings by W. Hunter, one of
which, “Greek Scholar,” depicts that old
Melbourne identity Bible Joe —a club-
less man who tramped the streets of the
city day and night for most of his life-
time like an urban Flying Dutchman,
with one eye open for cigarette butts and
the other turned inwards in contempla-
tion, but whose scholarship was so vast
that an archbishop delighted in his con-
versation.
* * * *
It is possible to test the fidelity of
S. Herman’s “Near the Quay”—on view,
with 23 other Herman paintings, at Sydney
Macquarie Galleries —by simply walking
down the street, standing on Dalgety’s
corner and staring past the Metropole to
the glittering or dim harbor. Whatever
the time of day, the buildings adjacent
to the Quay never resemble Herman’s
creations. If there is any doubt it is
possible to inspect the Quay from a lower
angle, near the approaches to the Bridge.
Or from the Customs building. But, how-
ever viewed, there is never the slightest
resemblance. Nor does the Bridge, at any
time of day or night, assume the peculiar
contortion Herman has credited it with:
high and humped, like the back of an
indignant cat.
* * * *
Edward Heffernan, who has been show-
ing portraits of beautiful women at
George’s, Melbourne, is by way of becom-
ing famous, inasmuch as most of his
sitters attended the opening of his exhibi-
tion. But most of his portraits resemble
magazine cover illustrations. That he can
do better is shown by a landscape, “Dusk
at Elwood,” which oddly contradicts the
flatness of the portraits.
* * * *
“F.S.”: I note with some satisfaction
that the committee appointed to examine
the functions of the British National
Gallery recommends dividing the Tats
into two sections, a National Gal-
lery of British art of all periods
and a National Gallery of modern
art, each with its own keeper and
director, the new modern gallery to
contain representative British paintings
not more than 100 years old, which, after
100 years, will be transferred to other
national galleries, if time has confirmed
their merit. This is exactly what I have
advocated for Australian galleries, especi-
ally the new gallery to be built in Mel-
bourne. One recent Melbourne purchase
depicts a “Man Taken 111 in the Street.”
It belongs to the school of child art. An-
other depicts a Madonna and Child as
broad as they are long.
Af fhe Talkies
“O.F.”: Good, serious film drama turns
up in unexpected places in Sydney.
John Ford’s masterly handling of four
Eugene O’Neill plays in “The Long Voy-
age Home” was an example—I ran across
it as a support to a Western at the Civic,
a theatre which caters consistently and
well for addicts of Westerns, whodunnits
and horror stuff. I’ve just struck the
same thing again at the same filmhouse.
As support to an opus about an erratic
artist who strangles his models and
dumps them down the drain, there is
showing “A Walk in the Sun,” a simple
and sincere statement on war and soldiers,
made in the depiction of an American
platoon fighting its way from the Salerno
beach-head to capture a German-occu-
pied farmhouse.
It’s a film in a thousand, but the Civic
runs its films for a week only.
Sydney Plaza is screening “Shine on
Harvest Moon,” light songandance with
Anne Sheridan and Dennis Morgan; the
Empire has “Doll Face,” a musicomedy
complete with crooner and the explosive
Carmen Miranda ; while the Embassy has
“Waltz Time,” a dreadful English rehash
of those Vienna musicals which probably
make all good Viennese want to leap into
the Danube.
In “The Stork Club,” at the Prince
Edward, Betty Hutton saves Barry Fitz-
gerald from drowning, unaware that the
old boy is a millionaire. He rewards her
with an anonymous gift of an open
slather on the best of New York’s stores
and hotels. Since she’s a hat-girl at the
club, and since her boy-friend is a band
leader returned from the wars and look-
ing eagerly for a job and suspiciously for
her benefactor, there are sufficient in-
gredients to keep everyone busy with
songs and dances or fights and reconcilia-
tions.
In “She Wouldn’t Say Yes” (Victory),
Rosalind Russell, as a female psychiatrist,
has her well-ordered and man-free career
invaded and disordered by Lee Bowman
as a W.C.C.S.A. (War Correspondent
Comic Strip Artist); in “Hold That
Blonde” (Capitol) Eddie Bracken is an
amnestic kleptomaniac with a predatory
urge to collar a Romanoff necklace, also
wanted by a clutch of crooks, including
Veronica Lake. Joan Leslie is “Cinderella
Jones” (Taller), a radio warbler who in-
herits 10,000,000 dollars on the condition
that she marries someone with a three-
figure I.Q. She invades a technical col-
lege to do it, and manages to find a
genius who is a band leader, or a band-
leader who is a genius, or something.

SPORTING NOTIONS
Favorite for the Grand National Hurdle last
year, when he fell early in the race, and again
favorite this year, Solvent made no mistake
about it at Flemington on Saturday, winning
comfortably by six lengths from the topweight,
Hiatus, with the South Australian representative,
Spawater, another two-and-a-half lengths away
third Solvent never looked like being caught
once he had hit the front about half a mile
from home. _ _
Including a 51b. penalty for his Toolambool
Hurdle win, Solvent carried 10.11. Spawdter had
11b. less and Hiatus 11.6. The Grand National
topweight limit is 12.7, so this yeai s held
may be regarded as only moderately good. Sol-
vent, Hiatus and Spawater are all six-year-old
geldings, respectively by The Buzzard, Paren-
thesis and Limond Lad. Solvent has a curious
jumping action, but it served very well in the
heavy going on Saturday, especially after ne
had taken the lead, from when on he cleared
them beautifully. Lightly framed, Hiatus
needed a firmer track, and a more recent run
in a hurdle race than he had had might have
helped him; he made several awkward jumps.
Spawater is a useful hurdler, and should not
have much trouble winning a shorter event be-
fore going back to S.A.
Krallis made the National running, and with
the first mile covered led Mercury Bay about
five lengths, with Solvent and Spawater an-
other length or two back. Krallis was still m
front with about six furlongs to go, but there
Spawater moved up fast and quickly settled
the leader. At this stage Solvent was going
exceptionally well, and coming to the half-mile
he jumped past Spawater and went out to a
four-lengths lead. Hiatus was steadily making
up ground from some distance back, but Sol-
vent still led by four or five lengths from Spa-
water and Mercury Bay as they made the turn.
Continuing his run, Hiatus passed the second
pair, but his rider soon- realised he had no
chance of running down Solvent.
* * * *
Sixteen of the next-best (and other) hurdlers
contested the Keilor Hurdle, run over two
miles. Here, too, the winner was of The
Buzzard’s stock, and was yet another six-year-
old —Buzharine, a moderate distance performer
on the flat having his first run over the jumps.
Though very easily beaten by Spawater at his
previous start, Camouflage (no doubt again be-
cause Meenan was up) was once more made
a hot favorite. He again had every chance, and
again just couldn’t stick it. Had Camouflage
been given all his own way out in front it might
have been different, but each time there’s been
one to go with him that has proved his un-
doing. This time it was Illumination, with
Buzharine always going well in third place. In
the run home Buzharine forced his way
through to win well from Illumination, with
the very tired Camouflage third.
The Kensington Steeple (a shade oyer two
miles) saw the South Australian Lashio loom
up as a solid-looking rival for the best of them
in next Saturday’s Grand National Steeple-
chase. A four-year-old Heroic’s Pride gelding,
Lashio was here noted as a National prospect
when he led a really good field to the straight
in the Birthday Cup in Adelaide. With Tente
scratched, Lashio carried top weight (11.5) on
Saturday and, ridden by Meenan, took up the
running after the early leader. Accelerate, had
bumped his rider out of the saddle. After
that Lashio was not headed, winning by five
lengths from Victory March, with Don Gypsy
another couple of lengths away third.
There are few things more misleading than
beaten horses for which excuses appear in order,
but Victory March could possibly be an ex-
ception. He had got within three lengths of
Lashio at the last jump, but his rider, G.
Godfrey, had trouble with a couple of riderless
horses in the run home. As sound as anything
in the field over the distance, Victmy March
could easily win his second National next
Saturday, when he drops a couple of pounds
to 10.13.
In the weights for the Kensington Steeple
Tente had 11.11, giving Lashio 61b. Scratched,
Tente was given a run in the flat distanced vent
merely to keep in racing trim. Against the
Kensington weighting, both Tente and Lashio
were weighted for the National Steeple at. 11.3,
but Tente copped a 61b. penalty for his Hope-
toun Steeple win, whereas there was no penalty
for the Kensington, so Tente still has to give
Lashio 61b. Tente is getting up in years, but
he won the Australian Steeplechase last year,
and last month he had two good Steeple wins
at Flemington, the second of them (the Hope-
toun) in soft going with 11.5 on his back.
Leicester Square (also a Flemington winner
last month, though Tente accounted for him
there), Gay Invader (though he probably hasn t
had enough recent racing), Highway King
(though also perhaps not raced enough) and
also Solvent and Jocularity should all help to
make next Saturday’s Steeple interesting if they
accept for the big event.
Taking a pick from what looks a fairly
good Grand National Steeplechase field; Tente,
1; Lashio, 2; Victory March, 3.

Shooting even further ahead in the jockeys’
premiership, A. Mulley rode four winners at
Randwick on Saturday, but even his loyal sup-
porters were among the many obliged to hoof
it home after the last race. Trams ceased run-
ning at 2 p.m. Undeterred, about 30,000
turned up, and a tote turnover of £141,302 was
actually greater than on the corresponding day
last year.
When he won at Rosehill, Kiaree evidently
had a good deal more in hand than was
apparent—he appeared to just scrape home.
At any rate he repeated the performance at
Randwick despite a 71b. rise in weight, some
stronger opposition and a longer trip, the dis-
tance of the Pacific Handicap being a shade over
'l2 furlongs. Never far from the leaders, Kiaree
was well and truly pocketed at the distance,
but McGrowdie was handed a silver-platter
opening on the rails and got through to down
Royal Peer in the final stride. Sancourt, third
after leading most of the way, was little more
than a neck behind the winner and is worth
remembering as he is eligible for restricted
events.
A 71b. allowance for apprentice W. Hogg
reduced Cragsman’s weight for the six-furlongs
Moore Park Handicap to 9st., at which he
carried 51b. less than the favorite, Accession.
Civic Pride, whose every# start strengthens the
opinion that she is another speedy squib,
turned it in earlier than usual, having had
enough when they entered the straight At the
distance Brazier and Oriental drew clear, the
latter prevailing as they neared the post, but
Cragsman came with a brilliant late run on the
outside and left them standing. A Rosehill
specialist, Cragsman had not previously won
at headquarters.
Mulley has struck one of those patches where
a jockey seems able to win on anything he
“ Cripes , he s got a bonzer straight left!”
rides; none of his four winners on Saturday
could be regarded as much better than mediocre.
It calls for a fair share of luck, but, more
important, the confidence born of riding good
horses, and with Bernborough, Chaperone and
the fine team of youngsters in the Payten
stable, Mulley has, bad his share of good
mounts. On Saturday he landed the Payten
representatives in both two-year-old races one
for fillies and one for colts and geldings. The
filly was Tact, a daughter of Ajax and High
Mary. Mulley’s vigor won the race, Photmia
being beaten a half-head, with November third.
Krasnoi, a good-looking Pentheus filly, dis-
played a nice turn of speed, getting away
smartly from the extreme outside and racing
across to join November in the pacemaking.
November had an easier task from No. 6
alley, and was less tired at the finish. Com-
pleting the' two-year-old double, the aptly-
named Raleigh (Golden Sovereign-Virgima)
had a comfortable win from King Hal and
Blaxland in a big field.
After scoring on Merry Time, who downed
Cherry Lad and Johnny Zero in the mile Trial,
Mulley rounded off the day by winning the
Maroubra Handicap on a three-year-old Em-
borough gelding, Souvenir, who led from the

heated for second. Being a son of The Buz-

Securing a good position early, while Mid-

to bring St. Buzz along at the right moment
to down Franjean and Thrums.

V.F.L. games on Saturday made little
difference to the position of the teams,
the expected occurring in all save one
match, wherein Melbourne suddenly came
out of its long sleep and downed Colling-
wood 13.13-10.9 in a flying last quarter.
At Essendon, where the Dons met Carl-
ton, there was nothing in it for three
quarters ; then Essendon came to light in
the “Same Old” style and booted them-
selves home, 12.12-9.9. Footscray, Rich-
jmond, Fitzroy and South Melbourne had
practice runs against North Melbourne,
Hawthorn, St. Kilda and Geelong respec-
tively. It’s Footscray, Essendon, Colling-
wood and Carlton, and the game of the
year is on next Saturday—Footscray v.
Essendon.

In Saturday’s Rugby Union Randwick
routed North 21-3. Things were willing
in the forwards ; one Randwick rucker
was sent off, and Cornforth, a North
forward, was knocked out, though he
returned later to carry on. An improved
side, especially in its backline combina-
tion, St. George surprised West by trounc-
ing it 22-5, scoring five tries to one.
Although Drummoyne notched four tries
to Parramatta’s one, Schomberg’s four-
penalty goals made the Reds thankful
when the bell clanged and they had won
by a point; 16-15. Other games: East
18, Manly 6 ; Gordon 14, University 11.
Randwick is leading, four points ahead of
East, with University and Drummoyne
(equal) third.

Whether because of the Queensland
winter climate or for some other reason,
the English-Welsh Rugby Leaguers im-
proved magically last week. They seeded
94 points to nil against Mackay, and,
coming .south to Brisbane, beat “Aus-
tralia” in the second “Test” by 14 to 5
four tries and a penalty goal to one try
and a penalty goal. Which means that
England retains the cigarette ashes or
whatever it is these Leaguers play for as
well as £>s.-d. To the agony of League
financiers 10,000 of the crowd of 55,000
crashed the gates at Brisbane only to see,
they and the paying customers, the
N.S.W.-Q. side outplayed in forwards
and backs and inferior even in the rough
stuff when the rough stuff was put on. As
in Sydney, the winners finished with 12
men, a forward being sent off, but this
time not until late in the piece,

Wimbledon yielded no pointers to
Davis Cup prospects except a suggestion
that there may be complete upsets.
Petra, who won the singles title, repre-
sents France, already eliminated in the
European zone, won by Yugoslavia.
U.S.A. and Australia are the others for
the Cup, and the more highly regarded
representatives of each at Wimbledon dis-
appointed. Of the Australians, Geoff
Brown made the best showing, reaching
all three finals, and he played his finest
tennis when it was most necessary—iri
the singles final, which he lost to Petra,
6-2, 6-4, 7-9, 5-7, 6-4; a grand match.
Pails was a complete disappointment, and,
while he has shown himself clearly the
better player at home, there seems no
doubt as to which has the better tempera-
ment for international play. Exactly the
same thing happened with the U.S. team,
Kramer failing to fulfill expectations,
while the lesser-regarded Tom Brown
surpassed himself, going down to Petra
in the singles semi-final, and then with
Kramer winning the doubles against Pails
and Geoff Brown, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2. Tom
Brown also won the mixed doubles, part-
nering Miss Brough to down Geoff Brown
and Miss Bundy 6-4, 6-4. The U.S. girls
made a clean sweep of the women’s
events.

Norman von Nida started off in the
British Open golf championship at St.
Andrews with a splendid initial round,
failed to sustain it and finished equal
third with three others. It was a fair
effort, but the Von had no call to blame
(a) the course or (b) his luck, when the
real cause of defeat was his bad tempera-
ment on the greens. He missed putts that
even an Eastlakes long-marker would
have rolled in with nonchalance. Sam
Snead (U.S.A.) the winner, Bobby Locke
(South Africa) and Johnny Bulla (U.S.AJ
equal second, blaming nobody.

Dick Harris and Bert Roach, welters
without renown, were late substitutes for
Tommy Hunter v. Jack Samuels at Leich-
hardt, and performed accordingly. Harris,
outboxed by the speedier Roach for five
or six rounds, led decisively afterwards to
get the decision.
9 * * *
It’s a long way from SU Andrews to
Sydjney, but the distance didn’t prevent
Von Nida and Jack Johnson erupting
simultaneous squeals. The golfer’s
that he would never play at St. Andrews
again ; the bruiser’s that he would never
again box in Sydney. This was after Alf
Gallagher had received a decision over
Johnson at the Sydney Stadium. Gal-
lagher deserved it. Attacking from the
first bell, he outfought Johnson in most
of the rounds, and put in the stronger
finish. As the contest was limited to
12 rounds and Johnson lasted the
distance, he did not lose either of his
titles, light-heavyweight or heavyweight.

Prices On the Rise?
The reserve price of wool, Australian
growers have been told, will, in the
present season, be 18.15 d. a pound, sub-
ject to a “contributory charge” of .9ld.
(5 p.c.). The price which had prevailed
from July 1, 1942, was 15.45 d, a pound,
and before that, back to the beginning
of the war, Britain paid Australia 13.4 d.
a pound. The rise of 4.7 d. since the war
began represents roughly 35 p.c. In the
1936-37 the clip averaged 16.7 d. Over
1929-33 (depression period) the average
was 9d. In the years 1923-1929 the
mean price was 19d.
It is important to take notice of the pre-
sent rise in the price of an essential world
commodity as part of a much broader
picture. Prices of many things have been
held down during this war by internal
Government decree and by agreement of
Allied Governments among themselves.
During the war the British Empire and
the United States co-operated closely in
order to prevent inflation creeping into the
cost of essential raw materials, and this
often had the effect of preventing neutrals
from Charging exorbitant prices, there
being, for all practical purposes, only one
buyer among the various Allies, with pur-
chases distributed among the nations in
accordance with the demands of war.
Now there has been some change in all
this. The spirit of lend-lease has gone,
and the creator of the spirit has also
passed. Costs have been rising while
prices have been kept down, and sub-
sidies have only meant heavier taxes.
In the United States there has been
the usual political reaction that fol-
lows a period of enforced co-operation
and discipline, and, although the more
sober-minded Americans are no more re-
actionary than they ever were, politicians
“with their ear to the ground” are play-
ing up to the apparent irresponsibility
that often takes charge of a section of
United States voters.
In this atmosphere nations that were
allies during the war are becoming more
competitive. Also, within countries, sec-
tions that were prepared to puli together
during the war are now more inclined to
pull one another apart. Thus we have
strikes, demands for higher wages, for
fewer working hours, higher prices by
wage-payers, and, in the United States, at
least a temporary abandonment of price-
control. The U.S. position has alarmed
Canada, which has taken action through
its exchange rate to protect its price sys-
tem.
In all Allied countries the war ended
with citizens holding, in the mass,
far more money than they ever possessed
before. This in spite of the fact that,
almost without exception, their countries
had become materially poorer during the
war rather than richer, Britain, Australia
and New Zealand certainly ended the war
with assets much depreciated ; the United
States was not so severely affected, and
Canada came out of it all comparatively
well, but no country has yet regained its
pre-war capacity for producing civilian
goods. And housing construction is years
behind requirements, even where the des-
truction of war has not wiped out tens
of thousands of dwellings, as in Britain.
In spite of an issue of money to the
people on a scale much greater than in
World War I, World War II ended with-
out such a steep rise in commodity prices.
During the second conflict Britain bought
metals at figures far below the average
paid during 1914-18, and also greatly be-
low the averages recorded in the most of
the post-war years that led to the 1929-33
depression. Metals were possibly an out-
standing case of cheap war materials,
there having been no full recovery in
prices after the depression. But the fact
remains that only minor raw materials
showed big price rises during the recent
war. Even tin ,and rubber, desperately
short for a period after Japan overran
Malaya and the East Indies, were kept
strictly controlled as regards price.
There is a tendency now to allow raw
materials come nearer to the prjpe that
would be set by demand, supply and
credit inflation. Wheat has risen to
the equivalent of 10s. or 11s. a
bushel overseas, and if more trans-
port were available, it would prob-
ably be higher. Britain, too, has set a new
level of prices altogether for metals.
There have been three increases since the
war ended, the latest being last week.
Lead is now ££s sterling a ton, compared
with £25 for most of the war period,
zinc is £49 55., compared with £25 155.,
and copper £B4, compared with £62.
has no particular reason to in-
crease the prices for these metals other
than to attract them to her factories. She
produces little or none of them herself.
Assuming that these are fair world-
market prices for metals, it is astonishing
to study the prices being paid by Aus-
tralian consumers for lead and zinc. In
Australia the Barrier mines are paid only
£l7 12s. sterling a ton for both these
metals. Copper is certainly more in line
with present world prices, being set at
£BO sterling a ton, this being because of
the war-timp scarcity of the metal in this
country and the high cost of producing it.
Tin in Australia during the war was paid
for on a basis more in keeping with world
parity, again for the reason that it was
scarce and hard to mine. But the metals
which are economical to produce in the
Commonwealth in competition with all-
comers, namely lead and spelter, are being
sold on the local market at roughly a
third of the new London parity. The
New York price for lead, before the latest
rise in London, was about the same as
the London figure.
At £55 sterling a ton in London lead
now compares with a highest price of
£53 7s. 6d. in 1920 and a lowest of
£2l 10s. (average £3B 4s. 7d.), Spelter
went as high as £64 ss. in 1920 and as low
“ We've considered your application for a rise,
Jenkins, and we've decided to raise your stool!"
as £22 10s. (average £45 4s. 6d.). Prices
for lead and spelter in subsequent years
declined from these high averages, but in
1925 were not greatly below them.
It was in 1925 that Britain returned to
the gold standard, with gold at 85s. per
fine ounce. At present gold is worth
£8 Bs. an ounce in London, but it would
go to a much higher figure on the open
market. That is a measure of the de-
preciation of the pound sterling.
Public buying power in Australia has
more than doubled since war began. Sav-
ings-bank deposits have inflated prodi-
giously, and so have some other savings.
People are anxiously awaiting an oppor-
tunity to buy homes, furniture, cars, better
clothes, etc., after having waited perhaps
seven to 10 years for the opportunity.
Before the war they may have lacked the
money. Now they have an accumulation
of money, but little chance of getting the
homes and other things they want be-
cause the production is not there. When
production does begin to come forward
the strain on price-control will be greater
than now.
Controlled prices for many commodi-
ties today are out of all proportion to
supply and demand, or to world parity.
It will be impossible to keep prices down
for ever, especially with labor reluctant
to do a fair day’s work. If wage-earners
as a body returned to their pre-war rate
of production there is a chance that they
would beat the worst features of the
inflationary menace now hanging over the
country. But labor in Australia seems
pigheadedly determined to dissipate the
value of its own savings by raising costs
and reducing the buying-power of all
money, including its own.
The tendency in Australia is plainly
one for higher costs, higher prices. If
controls over prices continue a year
two longer it may be that we shall gradu-
ally enter into a condition of higher
figures without the erratic and spectacu-
lar developments that seem bound to
occur in the United States. Most of us
are familiar with the features qf a spec-
ulative boom —that is, plenty of money
to spend or invest, a shortage of goods
or investments, and 'rising prices attract-
ing speculative buying, thus stimulating
demand in an already undersupplied
market. The boom usually brings, even-
tually, an oversupply of goods and new
investments, credit is extended too far,
confidence goes, and a slump occurs.
It may be that metal prices in London
have reached a high price in relation to
the statistical position of the metals them-
selves. It may also be that the cost of
British motor cars (some at almost
double pre-war prices) at present coming
to Australia is as high as it is likely to
be for some time. But there are many
other raw materials and manufactures,
home-produced and imported, that have
not yet exhibited the full effect of internal
and overseas inflation, and in the ordinary
bread-and-butter items of life we are
likely to see a steady rise in costs over
the next few years—either that, or a con-
tinuance of price subsidies provided out
of heavy taxes.
Whatever characteristic boom features
we may see in price rises now, there is
not the slightest doubt that the arrested
industrial and home-making development
of the British and American people dur-
ing the war has left a huge amount of
work waiting to be done —a potential
stimulus to industry (and prices) for
years to come. Also,
there is the towering pile
of war-time savings left
to sustain buying
power. In addition, so
long as those savings
last, labor looks like
keeping its output
down, with high costs
and selling prices.
Since labor holds the
key to production, the
antidote to present in-
flationary con ditions',
cynics may say the
sooner it throws its war-
time savings into the in-
flationary fire and is
brought to hardship—
and reason —the better.
But, whether we have a
spectacular inflationary
conflagration and then
an economic black-
out, or a gradual
letting-out of the infla-
tionary gas, we can
take our cue, as to costs
and prices, from past experience. In 1914
the Melbourne index of wholesale prices
was 1148. In the 1920’s it averaged about
1800. In 1933, worst slump year, it stood
at 1409 —still 23 p.c. above 1914. In
1939 it was 1665. Since then, in spite of
very strong price-control, it has risen to
2300.
The general price-level seems bound to
rise further yet. Costs and spending-
power are both pushing it up. If it is
pushed up too far it is certain to crash
back later, but, in the long run, most pre-
war price levels have gone. Homes are
not likely to be as cheap again as in 1939.
Canada, in raising the gold value of
its dollar by 10 p.c. in the exchanges,
has put its currency on a par with the
United States. The objective is plainly
one of establishing a shock-absorber be-
tween United States inflation and the
Canadian economy. Canada buys many
essentials, including iron ore, from the
United States, and it will now be 10 p.c.
cheaper to buy U.S. dollars with which
to buy U.S. goods (now generally becom-
ing dearer)' Canada is determined to
hold the price-line as long as possible.
6** * *
From January 1 next year Canada is
reducing the flat-rate company tax from
the equivalent of Bs. in the £ to 6s. in
the £, while excess-profits tax is being
brought down to 15 p.c. (against 20 p.c.)
in certain cases. All rates of e.-p.t. have
already been reduced ; soon after the end
of the Pacific war there was a cut from
100 p.c. to 60 p.c. in the maximum rate
of e.-p.t. In Australia there has been
no relief whatsoever for companies, and
the heaviest-taxed individual is the one
getting the least relief in the personal tax
cuts to be announced as pre-election bait.

Came June 30, and still the “war”-risk
bonus went on being paid to seamen on
the Australian coast. During the 11
months to May 31 an A.B. on one vessel
received £550 in wages, overtime and
“war”-risk bonus. Another collected £496.
A bosun received £640 in a similar period,
another over £7OO. The lowest rate is
more than £lO a week, the highest more
like £l4 10s. In all cases the seamen are
“kept” in good style, and don’t have to
surrender coupons. The Commonwealth
Government is paying these wages and
then charging its huge losses on coastal
shipping to taxpayers, concealing the
details.

Lifting the Lid?
It is sincerely to be hoped that the
United States, in its precipitate actions
that have followed the end of the war,
does not give free enterprise a very bad
advertisement in the eyes of the world.
Though, since the days of Roosevelts
New Deal, enterprise in the United States
has not been nearly as free as formerly,
there hasn’t been the same amount of
socialisation as has been seen in Europe
and parts of the British Empire. Even
the Federal reserve banking system is a
combination of private and public inter-
ests, and thus differs from the new Bank
of England and the Commonwealth Bank.
Lend-lease arrangements were brought
to a close by the United States with start-
ling suddenness when the war ended, and
this attitude of “good-bye to all that
has characterised much of the political
and economic behavior of the nation
since. Excess-profits tax was wiped out
at the beginning of 1946, and many other
factors calculated to restrain inflation
went overboard within six months of the
end of the Pacific war.
A couple of months ago the price-
control law was amended in a way that
President Truman refused to accept. As
a result, on June 30 the old law ran out,
and there was none in existence to take
its place. Whatever legislation, if any,
is brought in to control price inflation
again, the United States has been
carrying on without Federal price-con-
trol, though the business community and
landlords are being asked to stand by the
regulations previously operating, even if
these regulations no longer have legal
effect.
It was generally hoped that United
States productive capacity would soon
overtake arrears of production in most
fields, especially those of food and cloth-
ing, and that these items would then pass
out of price-control. But the country has
been riven by strikes and production has
been badly checked. Thus the apparent
need for price-control continues; there is
still that shortage of supplies for the
people which, in a condition of plentiful
money supply, leads to soaring prices and
'black-marketing.
The Administration itself is not blame-
less in this situation. While clinging to
arbitrary price-control it has not given
sufficient heed to the factors which make
price-control necessary. It is still spend-
ing on a large scale, though it aims at
producing a balanced Budget much earlier
than any British country.
It has tended to make wages conces-
sions without similar concessions to
manufacturers. It ended rationing too
quickly, as well as restrictions on the
allocation of essential raw materials.
Above all, it does not appear to have
given sufficient consideration to the essen-
tials of production recovery, including
the manpower question.
The post-war economic conflict reaches
its most critical point when administrative
controls designed to curb inflation and
spread available goods wisely overshoot
their target and do damage to production
incentives and cause waste of money and
manpower. Hence the necessity to carry
out price-control with painstaking care as
well as vigorous policing. Only by a con-
tinuous check on the effects of bureau-
cratic control upon the productive
machinery of the nation can a fully bene-
ficial result be achieved from price-con-
trol. The aim of price-controllers must
be to put themselves out of a job as
rapidly as they can by eliminating the
need for price-control, and the only way
that can be achieved is by doing every-
thing possible to expand production of
necessary goods and services without let-
ting inflation rob people of a large part
of their savings.
In winning the conflict between controls
and inflation production must not be too
much discouraged by taxation. But taxa-
tion must be high enough to look after
essential Government services, including
rehabilitation of servicemen and public
utilities, and to attend to the war debt.
Taxation, on the other hand, should not
continue to be levied for the purpose of
providing mere vote-catching or job-mak-
ing expenditure. And it should be levied
in a way that will discourage spending
while aiding production. However un-
palatable the fact may appear, it is neces-
sary that the burden of necessary taxation
should fall as proportionately heavy upon
wage-earners as it does upon industry it-
self Wage-earners’ savings encourage the
consumption of goods, whereas the sav-
ings of industry usually are ploughed
back so that production may be increased.
Heavy spending by wage-earners is a most
fertile source of inflation.
In the United States prices have at no
time during the war been controlled so
effectively as in British countries. Canada,
across the border, has kept the rise in
prices at about half that recorded by the
United States up to June 30. Now the lid
has been lifted in the U.S.—temporarily,
at any rate—and the repercussions may
be world-wide.
But, however much inflation may now
rear its head in America, we must not
overlook the fact that Congress has not
abandoned price-control in a planned
way, and that the vicious strikes now be-
setting the nation are adding to the in-
flationary menace enormously. One
might almost say that the strikes are being
fostered by foreign agencies determined
to give the United States so much trouble
at home that her hands will be tied when
things happen abroad.
In Australia we may take warning from
what happens in America. The United
States is jolting its way back to a peace-
time economy, and possibly into a lot of
industrial and financial disturbances.
But, though the end of price-control in
America could, by the very way of its end,
bring confusion and hardship to the
people, we in the Commonwealth should
aim steadily at the objective of an end to
price-control made possible and per-
fectly safe —by bountiful production.
It was estimated in the Budget for
1945-46 that reverse lend-lease would cost
the Commonwealth £2O million. There
was only about three months of reverse
aid to the United States during the finan- •
cial year, and it is unlikely that the esti-
mate was exceeded. The washing-up of
lend-lease generally is to cost Australia
£9 million. But the washing-up may re-
lease for Consolidated Revenue more of
the profits made by the Division of Im-
port Procurement out of lend-lease
material marketed on a commercial basis.
Some D.I.P. profits were brought into
account in March. Accounts adjustments
during June should be numerous, and
most of them will deserve explanation
by the Treasurer at the appropriate time.
It should be made quite clear to the
public, for instance, how much money is
being lost by the Government in its
control of coastal shipping. This is not
even clear from the Budget papers m
which an item of £SB million appeared in
1944-45 under the heading of miscel-
laneous credits.” These items are believed
to be so “miscellaneous ’ as to deserve
specific consideration.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Wonk”: Billy hadn’t been to the city
before, and after roaming the streets help-
lessly for some time he hailed Jake’s
cousin with delight and presented his
destination on an ancient slip of paper.
“Sure,” said the city cove. “You’ll have
to take a North Road tram to the Cri-
terion, then get a bus up past the Ceno-
taph. Go as far as the Princess, then up
Langridge, down East Crescent and cut
through by the old Vac. You can’t miss
it So long.” Two months later Billy
was riding out his road gate when the
mailcart stopped, and a city passenger
alighted and came across. It
was Jake’s cousin from the city.
“This White Bridges?” he asked
uncertainly, as he greeted Billy.
“Jake said you’d lend me a horse
and direct me to the place he’s
bought out this way.” A slow
grin seeped over Billy’s homely
dial. “Sure,” he agreed heartily,
waving a hand towards half a
dozen nags in the roadside pad-
dock. “Take the mare I
bought off Sam last week;
the others ain’t broke. Then
head up the Black Mountain track till
y’ come opposite where the ol’ coach
stables used t’ be. Angle off there, past
the place where Dad Hawkins’ nag rolled
on him, till y’ strike the gully where Buff
found the good prospect. When the couch
gives way t’ kangaroo an’ red grass, cut
over the spur where there’s a stray apple-
box or two among the other timber, an’
y’ll find Jake’s place a coupla miles past
old Steve’s trap-line. Y’ can’t miss it.
So long.”
*■* * *
“Zake”: Force of habit is strong, and
seems to be strongest in those parts where
life is simplest. Queerest case I heard of
was an aged agriculturist hear Tubba-
murra (N.S.W.) who, under incessant pres-
sure from his family, bought an old car
to replace the horse and sulky for “going
into town.” On the rare occasions on
which he washed it he would, when
approaching the rear of the yehicle with
bucket and rag, stroke the mudguards
soothingly and cease his humming to say
“Steady old girl, it’s all right!”

“Horseless Horseman”: Does any
Aboliar know authentic details of the
well-known story about the stockman
who, to rob a parrot’s nest, stood up in
the stirrups and thrust his Hand down a
hollow overhanging gum . . . need I go
on? When the horse moved off, the man
was left hanging by his arm, which he
was forced to cut off at the shoulder; he
then bled to death. The incident was
first told to me when a youth on a North
Queensland station by the manager there
as happening in the Gulf-country. Next,
at Euston (N.S.W.) I heard it appropri-
ated to “somewhere along” the Murray,
and since then to almost every district in
Australia, the nor’-west alone being the
exception. Halliday Sutherland in South-
ward Journey places the epic as occurring
out from Innamincka, but as usual with-
out mention of man, run, or date. I’ve
an idea now this story is a fable invented
to make newchums in the saddle a little
cautious.
“Old-timer”: “Crutch” was enthusiastic
at his first sight of Mildura, which burst
upon eyes long inured to the sombre
Mallee as must the oasis to the Saharan.
He revelled on the lawns in Deakin-
avenue, admired the flowers in their beds,
luxuriated in the shade of palm and sugar
gum, was spellbound by the splendid old
Murray slipping by the bridge. At the
big pub we struck an equally-enthusiastic
citizen of the place who put “Crutch” in
his car and ran him out through the settle-
ment. It was October and all the vines
were in their early glory, with the
irrigation channels flowing from Red
Cliffs to Merbein and all the district a
symphony of green and eager life, with
the higher tones of the homestead and
the sudden trills of happy villages like
Irymple opening before the explorer’s
eyes. “Crutch” came back that night from
a day of sunshine, visions and excitement
and poured his flood of feelings over me
as we brushed ourselves up in the room
we shared. “Yair,” he wound up, “she’ll
do me. Must be just about the best place
I ever seen. It just shows y’, y’ know.
By cripes, she’d never have come along
like this if they’d left it to them lazy
bloomin’ abos,” Then “Crutch,” the best
half-caste scrub-cutter from Manangatang
to Murrayville, went whistling down-
stairs.

“C.E.”: Chris was camped on Back
Creek with Red Harry, when the news
came that he bad won the big lottery.
With enough money to keep him in
plenty, he said good-bye and departed
citywards. Six months dragged by, with
“Fair go—l saw it first!”
Red splitting and hauling on his own;
then, coming in one evening, the old chap
found Chris boiling the tea billy. “You!”
he gasped. “Gripes! Spend all y’r
dough? Well, whatcha come back f’r?”
“Thought I’d give y’ a hand with them
few miles o’ fence.” “Awright,” Red
agreed. “But, cornin’ back here t’ freeze,
when y’ c’d sit by a fire all day! ” Chris
grimaced. “Ever tried sittin’ by a fire
day after day f’r weeks?” he asked.
“Er... yair, we 11...” Red thought
for a minute. “Y’ c’d travel around.”
“Y’ mean, shift out to another
joint that prob’ly ain’t ’s good’s
the one y’re in?” “Anyway,” Red con-
tinued, “with all that dough, y’ c’d live
on bonzer tucker.” “Y’ don’t get ’ungry,”
came the protest. “But,” pursued Red,
“Couldn’t y’ buy things, an’ er... see the
sights, an’ visit places, an’ loaf?” “I done
all that,” admitted Chris. “What else?”
“Why, y’ wouldn’t need t’ work no
more,” declared Red, “Down there,
cripe.s, there ain’t ,a thing y’ couldn’t
have.” “That’s just it. Don’t y’ see,”
sighed Chris, “there weren’t nuthin’ left in
life f’r a man t’ want”

“Edjudina”: The trouble about these
schemes for getting water out of the
roots of trees in dry country is that if you
can’t find any surface water in a swamp,
well or gnamma hole you will scarcely
find it in roots, that store being only
present when the vegetation is flush
after rain is not far past. Ambling out
to the Queen Victoria Springs, well east
from Kurnalpi (W.A.), one dry year we
came on several places where the spinifex
blacks, evidently in extremities, had tried
the root trick. Their idea was to dig up
the roots of a species of mallee, which,
itself being small and Comparatively
sappy, was likely to have sappy roots;
these they broke into four-inch pieces and
stood up on a sheet of bark. But they
didn’t appear to have got much water,
for the “plant” was left standing while
scattered around were shorter pieces of
root, obviously sucked in the desperate
effort to obtain a little moisture.

“Dusty Gully”: “There’s opportuni-
ties in country centres these days,” main-
tained Tom Hickey. “Take Mudstone,
f’rinstance. I run the store an’ post office,
bakery an’ meathouse, mend boots, do a
bit of carpenterin’ an’ windmill-fixin’,
maintenance cars an’ vet stock. But
there’s still a good openin’ f’r doctorin’,
pullin’ teeth, shoein’ horses, insurance
agent, tailor, blacksmith an’ skinbuyer.
If we fixed that up the place’d go ahead
properly; an’, besides, if the bloke c’d
play draughts it’d give me an’ him some-
thin’ t’ occupy our spare time.”

“Herbert Dawson”: Have been reading
a purple-patched press yarn of a big
dingo in a southern State which “invari-
ably killed calves by tearing out their
throats.” In all my years in Queensland
cattle country I have never seen a calf
with its throat mauled. The killing has
always been by disembowelment, though
the warrigal favors various holds in pull-
ing the calf down. Bitten calves, saved
by their mothers, frequently are minus
tails, or carry wounds on the back, flank
or buttocks, or have drooping, torn ears.
But, saving the great cat tribe, what wild
animals do kill by a throat hold? Foxes
and native cats, for blood-sucking pur-
poses probably, do make incisions in the
throat, but certainly not the dingo.
Powerful dog though he is, the dingo
lacks courage. I found a very fine speci-
men in a trap I had set. He had dragged
the trap-log into a mess of fallen briga-
low and was well tangled up. Seeing
me coming he made a great show of
defiance, roaring rather than howling
(most dogs are silent at this stage), but
he took the bullet from five yards,, strug-
gling to get free —but away from not
towards me.

“Dominic”; What animal call, howl,
bark or roar has the farthest carrying
power? Lying in bed in Nedlands these
recent cold mornings I have heard the
lions of South Perth Zoo giving tongue
as plainly as though they were a bare
thousand yards away. Yet the sound had
to cross the Swan, then lift over Mt.
Eliza to reach me; a matter of straight
distance at least three miles.

“Blime”: Robbie was riding past the
blacksmith’s shop when a voice hailed
him. “Hey, I got a sheep pup for you,”
bawled Jack. “Tim Jacobs left him last
week.” Robbie dropped off, interested.
“Don’t think I can take him this trip,”
he answered. “Will he be awright?”
“Sure, leave him a few weeks,” agreed
Jack, heartily. “The kids think he’s
Christmas, and w© got plenty of scraps ;
all except once when I had to get him
sixpenn’orth off the butcher,” Robbie
dived towards a pocket. “I better give it
to y’ then,” he suggested. “Don’t want
y’ to be out of pocket over him.”
“Gripes, no,” scorned Jack. “What’s a
bob’s worth o’ meat now’n then?” “Aw-
right,” grunted Robbie easily. “How’d
the football go, Sat’dee?” “Eh? Aw,
we got beat. Though, don’t expect t’
find him fat, mind y’. Y’ don’t get much
off Greasy for a bob. Always pays t’
get a coupla deeners’ worth while y're at
it.” “Yair,” Robbie nodded. “What’d
the team get beat by?” “ ’Bout two
goals. An’ then he eats a lot for a pup
that size. Still, a couple o’ parcels a
week off Greasy oughter do, eh?”
“Easy,” agreed Robbie. “Who wus
umpire?” “Charlie Sparks.”, Jack
rubbed his chin. “ ’Course, if y’ insist on
payin’,” he pointed out, “well, I know
how y ? feel. But I wouldn’t like y’ f
think I mind spendin’ three or four bob
a week on that little pup.”

“Exkewex”: Ted Scorfield’s drawing
(B. 19/6/’46) of the horse specially bred
for work on steep hillsides recalls the
time when hoop pine was being felled
along the steep slopes around Canungra,
Q. (site of the big jungle-training school
during the war). The cutters worked in
pairs, and Hoppy and Limpy made up
one of the best-known teams. The yarn
told to all newcomers was that a clerk in
the city office, acting on instructions to
send along men specially suited to steep
country, had picked these two. To the
obvious objection that each was short in
the same leg the answer was that head-
office clerks were a bone-headed lot and
it was just the sort of thing they would do.

“Colonial Cove”: The Portuguese have
a claim that they discovered Terra
Australis Incognita as early as 1511, So
it is possible that some of those hardy
mariners made a- landing on the West-
ralian coast and there became acquainted
with the kangaroo, enabling it to be
depicted on the map in the Mitchell
Library dated 1563 (B. 22/5/’46), though
that map when it lumped Australia into
South America was obviously out of date
before it was printed. The Spaniards
knew their geography better than that,
for in 1567 Mendana sailed from Callao,
Peru, then a well-established port, in
search of the Great South Land ; and he
certainly was well aware of the vast
ocean that lay between the two land
masses. Further, although Dampier in
1688 became the first Englishman
officially to set foot' on Australian soil,
he wasn’t the first Englishman to sail
Australian waters. In July, 1622, there
arrived at Batavia two boatloads of ship-
wrecked Englishmen, their ship, Tyral,
having crashed on a reef off the western
coast of the Great South Land. This reef
has since been identified as an outlier of
the Monte Bello Is., part of the Dampier
Archipelago, due west from Cossack,
n.-w. W.A. The only fauna of the Monte
Bellos are wallabies and lizards, so it is
possible that some ancient mariner got
a sight of a pouched marsupial there.

“X.E.D.”: Pardon my extreme youth,
but an esteemed friend of fiction and jour-
nalese, in the hardbitten bushman who
takes a glowing coal from the fire between
his fingers and leisurely ignites his pipe,
raises my doubts. His counterpart in other
lands has been doing it for untold years.
I’d take it as a favor if someone could
, tell me where to find one of these freaks

“Dicky Beach”: In the silvery midst of
what will probably be our last haul of
sea-mullet for this Queensland season,
there flashed and leapt the biggest
tailor that I’ve every seen alive.
Measuring three feet and an inch
from the jut of its underhung jaw to
tail-fin tip, it weighed 17-jrlb. while still
kicking. Average length among tailors
in these parts is around 18in. when at
spawning age. The record specimen in
the Sydney Museum is 3ft. long and
weighed after being bled. It was
caught at Harrington (N.S.W.) in 1933.
The same species is found in most tropical
and subtropical seas all over the world:
in Victoria and Westralia they are called
skipjacks; in America and the West
Indies bluefish; and in South Africa
elftvisch. Among the best of all eating
fish when really fresh, they deteriorate
rapidly in flavor if not bled and cleaned
very soon after death. The flesh smokes
particularly well. Young tailor are first-
rate bait for their own kind, and for other
fish as well. Which is only a fair deal
by Nature after all, for from babyhood
up they are the most ravenous of all fish-
killers in the sea, and after gorging them-
selves full will continue to kill and mangle
for the sheer fun of it.

“C.W.”: Unlike “Wigwag,” during
the three years I served in the Solomons
area with the Yanks and Kiwis
I never heard of a single casualty
from falling coconuts (B, 19/6/’46).
One of my jobs as an “old resident” of
the area was lecturing rookies on the
various things to avoid in that part of
the world. The Marines quickly learnt
never to stand or sit under a palm with-
out first looking up. The bulk of dry
coconuts fall at night, as do green ones
damaged by rats, and troops were
instructed to keep clear of the vicinity
of the palm trunk during those hours.
My impressions of such dangers in areas
where actual fighting was going on was
that there were no nuts and generally
very little palm left to fall. Anyway,
at such times, a casualty from such a
cause would probably prefer to say a
Nip rifle-butt or spent shell did the
damage, and put up a “wound stripe.
SOLITUDE.
As we drove one day through the lignum swamp
Where the spelling horses ran,
A loose horse broke from the noonday camp
And trotted beside bur van.
We knew him then as a favorite steed,
A beautiful dappled dream,
The grey that went in the near-side lead
In the Boss’s showyard team.
He swung in front of our station pair
And kept in the near-side place,
And trotted on with his beauty bare
Of bridle or rein or trace.
He led them away on the Woolshed track
As a harnessed leader would,
And we had not the heart to turn him back —
The old grey Solitude.
He slowed and stood at the paddock gate,
Then guided the others through,
And whinnied once for his absent mate,
Then took up his task anew.
He was the pick of the four good greys
That had won three Cups in Bourke;
His poise in the ring was past all praise
And his pluck on the road at work.
He held his place to a measured inch,
Left room for his swingle-bar,
And quickened pace at the sandhill pinch
And slowed where the deep ruts are.
So he showed the way to the Five-mile tank
With never a trace or tie,
Lifting his feet with a showyard swank
And his lean grey head held high.
And whenever I think of the brave bush teams
And their leaders staunch and good
The horse of them all that haunts my dreams
Is the old grey Solitude.
SCOTLAND.
WILL H. OGILVIE.


“Donald Mac”: When Young Scotty
read reports that lads were earning fabu-
lous sums trapping rabbits, he decided
that the city was the environment of
fools who didn’t want easy money.
With two friends in it, Scotty’s expedition
set off armed with traps, guns, baits and
ferrets. Weekly letters were written giving
details of catches, varying from dogs to
colds —never any rabbits. When Scotty
returned home after only six weeks’ so-
journ in Utopia the locals wanted to
know why. “Well,” said Scotty somewhat
disconsolately. “We was dead unlucky—
we struck very fussy rabbits. They
wouldn’t come at the old lettuce we was
putting on the traps.”

“Bo”: “Them sulphur-crested cocka-
toos are shrewd birds, an’ they got long
memories, too,” said “Trigger” Thomp-
son. “I had one when I was up at
Noonan’s Crossin’, One day a passin’
drover dropped in for a yarn. He was
chewin’ tobaccer, and he lets fly an’ gets
Joey in the mince pie with a mouthful o’
juice—whether be accident or not I
couldn’t say. The cocky don’t say
nothin’, though he could have said plenty ;
but I notices after the bloke’s gone he’s
sorta thoughtful. He had the run o’
the place, o’ course, an’ I notices he
spends all his spare time where they’re
handling sheep. It musta bin about three
years before that drover come by again,
this time with a big mob. As he an’ his
dogs’re tryin’ to get the jumbucks oyer
the river a voice comes from the thick
branches of a big gum near by alterin’ his
orders to the dogs an’ callin’ him fer
everything. The bloke has a hell of a
job spread over several hours gettin’ the
sheep across. That drover used the
crossin’ a good bit after that —he had to,
it was the only suitable place for miles
up an’ down the river—an’ every time he
lobbed with a mob Joey’s there to get
him in the toils. One day the bloke comes
an’ when Joey starts he gets out a shot-
gun and simply puts a fine toothcomb
o’ shot through the gum. He got the
mob over without any trouble then.”
“Killed the cockatoo, eh?” someone
asked. “No, Joey was too smart to fall
for that,” said “Trigger” scornfully ; “he
was up another tree doin’ the ventrilo-
quist stuff. But he laughed so much the
pore cow fell backwards out of his tree
an’ broke his neck!”

“Sou’-west”: If those fishermen of
Mallacoota Inlet get through their plague
of jellyfish with nothing worse than a
slight decay of their nets (B. 22/5/’46),
they will be lucky. On the W.A. coast
the medusa is always with us, and no
matter how much a net is washed the
slime sticks. But the worst feature of
this slime is that it is an irresistible
attraction to rats, which, of course, swarm
on every waterfront. Have seen nets
gnawed to rags. Nothing short of storing
a net in a steel box will defeat the
rodents.

“Mat’s Mate”: We were four in a
gang, spreading metal at so much a yard
on a Gippsland road. We hadn’t bar-
gained on rain and its effect on the
formed earth road-bed —an inch meant
waiting at least a day until it dried out.
Mat was the tacitly accepted leader and
it became obvious, after averaging four
days’ work a month, that his, temper was
growing short. “Ruddy place,” he
snorted. “Fancy a man cornin’ down
here in June. Gripes, if they get two fine
days together all the bloomin’ cockies
start runnin’ round complainin’ how dry
it is.” Bill, who didn’t know Mat as well
as I did, tried to propitiate him. “Aw,
well,” he said, “June’s nearly over and
that means the days’ll start t’ draw out
an’ we can get in a bit more time.” Mat
turned slowly and looked Bill over.
“Yair,” he sneered, “the days are drawin’
out, all right. An’ what does that mean?
It means the flamin’ rain’s got all the
longer to fall. An’ that’s why I’m like
the flamin’ days, I’m drawin’ out, too,
before I start growin’ fins.” Two hours
later that road gang wasn’t.
“Betcha”; Have had evidence of dogs
and cattle being color-conscious, but
hadn’t met the same sense in a sheep
until recently when I discovered a ewe
that ran like blazes from her own black
lamb. For years she has been worked
and yarded by black dogs, and when her
yearly contribution to the meat industry
proved to be twins she immediately
claimed the white member, and as soon
“Next Saturday you have your bath at homer
as possible put a safe distance between
themselves and the objectionable black.
Manoeuvring her into a mothering yard,
I grabbed the boong and dropped him
over* but the ewe’s only reaction was to
back into a corner and stamp a foot
indignantly at the intruder. The smell,
when forced to close quarters, ap-
parently intrigues the ewe, but not
sufficiently to. overcome the horror from
the conviction that seeing is believing.
Any helpful suggestions? Does one
blindfold the old girl, paint the youngster,
or let them go in the hope he will hop
in for his cut after dark?

“Reef Ear”: “Potrero’s” boundary ridei
(B. 19/6/’46) and his clock remind me
of “Old Smiddy,” who asked the super-
cargo of a well - known Island liner
to get him a wife by advertising in
the Sydney daily papers. Just as
“Smiddy” was in the launch and leaving
the ship’s side for the shore, he turned
and shouted up to the super-cargo “Und
Dorn. If you kan’d ged me a vife ged me

“Colonial Cove”: I liked A. S. Alli-
son’s “Ballad of the Good Deed” (B.
5/6/’46), but I’m afraid that any shell-
back skipper who rounded the Horn from
the east in the effort to get to Australia
would have fallen foul of his owners.
The way to Australia, whether to Fre-
mantle or Sydney, was to strike south-
west across the Atlantic till Rio was
almost in offing; then south-east to the
Cape ; then due east until either Leeuwin
or Kangaroo Island rose to view. That’s
the way the winds blow. Later it was
discovered that by dropping well to the
south on the run east from the Cape even
better time could be made. Which was
how Marco Polo, under Captain “Bully”
Forbes, broke the record in 1852, Liver-
pool to Melbourne in 52 days, beating the
steamship Australia by a clear week.
“ Dammit , I'll be cracking my neck on that mat one night!”
Leaving Port Phillip, or any other eastern
side port, the sailing ship maintained her
eastward course, right across the southern
Pacific, rounded the Horn from the west,
then zigzagged up the Atlantic. Such
was the Great Circle, laid down in sailing
directions by the American wind expert,
Maury. Even before his time, though,
vessels calling at Fremantle via the Cape
often kept on to Hobart, Launceston or
Sydney, picked up a cargo and went on
to round the Horn. Many of them were
cockleshells of less than 200 tons.

“Exmed”: Bamboo is put to nefarious
as well as useful purposes. A little of
the stem, grated to a powder and dropped
into a man’s food, will, if persisted in,
produce a debilitating dysentery which
within the tropics will not fail ultimately
to bring death. The action is mechanical,
the tiny splints of bamboo piercing the
tender lining of the digestive column.
Many a white man has thus been removed
by vengeful native servants.

“Colonel Bungstarter”: “D.R.H.’s” dis-
covery (B, 19/6 1 ’46) in a jar of dirty water
of a half-inch cross-eyed worm with its
mouth in the middle of its bingy is un-
exciting in comparison with lots of other
apparitions deriving from fluid-containers.
Although I can speak only from first-
hand accounts by eye-witnesses, several
have been of the most exciting descrip-
tion. My old friend “The Dipsomaniac”
of earlier Bulletin days discovered
several giant bats with crocodile heads
and bright red eyes emerging one after
another from an ordinary rum bottle and
flying furiously round the room.
Awakened by the terrified shouts of a
cabin mate on a coastal steamer I assailed
with a pillow the huge serpent which he
saw pokiag its head through the porthole
and snapping its red-hot fangs at him.
When, to his relieved satisfaction, I had
beaten it off, and closed the port, he
explained that it had come out of the
bottle under his pillow, but had grown
terribly after a sea bath. Riding along a
N.Q. road within range of the once-
famous Banyan rum, I came on a swaggie
belting Matilda with a waddy. The frag-
ments of a broken bottle glistened in
the sunlight. “ ’Ere, mate,” he panted,
“givsh a ’and ter stiffen thish yere crocer-
dile, an’ look out ’e don’t bite yer "orse. ’

“Naturala”: The apus is not only the
world’s quickest growing crustacean but
is also, along with a larger relative, the
king crab, the world’s oldest. The king
crab is sometimes called the horseshoe
crab, just as the apus is the horseshoe
shrimp—from the shape of the carapace.
However, the crab —it commonly is as
big as a horseshoe —never left the sea.
Yet it also seems to have the faculty,
under favorable conditions, of repro-
ducing its kind in enormous numbers a
rainy season in Central Australia will see
apus spring to life in countless millions.
Along the North Amfirican Atlantic coast,
which is the king crab’s chief habitat, the
beaches at times will be so covered with
the dead crustaceans that tons of them are
carted away for manure.

“B. 4”: Wild pigs, which in many parts
of Queensland have reverted to the con-
dition of their porcine ancestors of the
forest, are more to be feared than
dingoes. Bogged sheep and cattle are
attacked and eaten alive by these brutes.
Semi-wild porkers at Tangorin, C.Q.,
once attacked and ate a toper sleeping
beside an outshed, before providing
targets for the Muttaburra police.
Camped one wintry flight on the Flinders
below Richmond I heard the grunting of
wild pigs and hurried from my snug nap
below the trap on to the decking. From
there I clouted a couple of boars with
the tomahawk as they stood up to
snuffle and grunt with paws on the boot.
Before daylight, I presented that mob
with a box of random .22’s. One of two
mates while camped near Kynuna for a
jollo stayed overnight in the township
where he went for more staggerjuice.
Next morning all he could find of his
mate was one partly-eaten leg, the boar
pigs having done him in during the night.
WINTER.
The herds stream down from Feathertop,
A chill wind whips the pass,
An ice-hand stills the leaping stream,
The rice-snow’s in the grass;
ffut still one eager miner stays,
Though others seek the valley ways.
The dingo howls his hunger pang,
The eagle seeks in vain,
And day by day a winding-sheet
Creeps down the mountain chain;
But still the miner drives his lead.
The falling flakes he will not heed.
The riven boulder casts its scree,
The snow-gums bend and crack,
The piling snowdrifts press upon
The haven of his shack;
But, blood afire with lust of gold,
He does not feel the growing cold.
A blizzard sweeps the upland plain,
A world is frozen fast.
A ski-borne mailman fighting through,
His head bent to the blast,
Amid the turmoil of the storm
Bends to a snow-enshrouded form.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DO N'T WOR RY. I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZCOS."
D.D.T. as a Dip.
“A.W.S.M.”; Now that D.D.T. is avail-
able as a water solution it adds consider-
ably to the efficiency of dips or sprays in
which it is used, provided care is exercised
in the preparation and application of the
dipping mixture.
In spray dipping the point to watch is
the sump, which should be of two storeys,
the upper being covered by an iron plate
drilled with drainage holes; six inches
underneath that should be a ledge on
which a wooden frame covered with brat-
tice cloth can be laid ; the liquid straining
through both into the bottom of the sump,
where a foot valve, also strained, should
be adjusted three inches at least off the
floor. The brattice frames can be taken
out and replaced as they choke with the
dust and droppings—spraying on the re-
verse side will clean them arid they are
?ady for use immediately.
It is not yet realised by everyone what
a powerful insecticide D.D.T. is—after
using it commercially for over 12 months
I have come to the conclusion that fail-
ures to obtain results are mainly caused
by lack of comprehension of the manner
in which it kills and faulty application.
We had outstanding success from water
emulsions, but were prevented from go-
ing further in its application to animals
owing to the drug having tb be dissolved
in organic solvents —mainly oils. These
were liable to scald or blister animals
even with every care, and there was
always risk of burning foliage on plants
and trees as well. Now, however, we get
the drug as a 50 per cent, water-soluble
concentrate containing nothing injurious
to animals or foliage—a most revolution-
ary substance when you realise that
D.D.T. is not soluble in water in the
ordinary way.
The dispersion of D.D.T. from this
preparation is extremely fine and is move
effective than that made from emulsions
—and they were good. The cost of this
stuff is also 25 per cent, cheaper in the
mixture than previous emulsions. There
is no odor and no staining. The drug is
of such a fineness that it is definitely
toxic to maggots when ingested. Another
thing, dip made from this preduct can
be topped up and re-used over a period
of several months without any apparent
loss of activity. When the spray dries on
animal or foliage it won’t wash off —dust
may insulate it from contact with an
insect but rain will restore its activity.
Dairy Hygiene.
“C.A.S.”: “Rooster” (B, 29/5/’46)
advocates more inspectors. Surely we
have enough at present. As a dairyfarmer
of 35 years’ experience I admit the truth
of much of his complaint, but additional
inspectors with dictatorial powers would
make an already unpopular industry still
more unpopular.
On one- or even two-man farms there
is little time for the niceties which
“Rooster” desires. Milking is but one of
the chores on what is usually an under-
manned farm. In these days an em-
ployer is loath to insist on a farmhand
doing his job in any other way but his
own. The dairyfarmer as a class is just
as efficient as other industrial classes, and
in none is the standard 100 p.c. As living
conditions improve efficiency seems to de-
cline ; work becomes jnore or less supple-
mentary to other interests.
Knowledge of what to do is general,
but performance is a different matter.
The shorter working week apd the urge
for mechanisation aggravate the position.
“Run and shut the flamin' gate or she'll get out!"
Now that the woman is quitting the cow-
yard male ideas of cleanliness will prevail,
and the desire to get to some more con-
genial and to many some more important
task will make for speed rather than
efficiency.
The standard of buildings specified in
Victoria is expensive, and there are
numerous cases where production has been
retarded because of inability to comply
with requirements. In a country where a
citizen still has the right to choose his
occupation, stringent or irksome require-
ments, even though desirable, may drive
men from an industry. At present, food
production has first priority.
Potatoes under Irrigation.
“Pat Ater”; Practical results followed
two years’ tests on a 12-acre plot at
Crookwell (N.S.W.) on C. C. Hewitt’s
property with Factors. First finding was
that with sufficient water for irrigation the
devastatirlg effects of grub could be prac-
tically controlled ; second that an aston-
ishing yield, even for this rich soil, could
be expected.
The dam was built at the foot of a
tiny spring-fed creek which did not carry
much water but was never dry, A 4in..
centrifugal pump and lines of piping
with nozzles giving a' range of 36ft,
were installed. Cost of dam was £6O and
pump and pipe line £340. Power came
from a tractor.
In 1943 the plot was under sub.-clover.
It was cultivated and sown in November,
1944, and a first soaking was given at
flowering time in February, 1945, and
continued for eight days, giving an overall
watering of three inches. Three weeks
later (at “grub” time) the dam was re-
plenished and a second soaking to a
depth of two inches was given. That
w£s all. Later an- inch of rain fell. The
remarkable yield of 180 tons off 12 acres,
averaging 15 tons and With top lot of 20
tons to the acre, followed. Some trouble
was experienced at digging with sub.-
clover, which reappeared under watering,
but a mechanical digger overcame this
problem. One section of H acres yielded
460 bags of saleable potatoes. It was
the best crop in the district’s history.
This year equally satisfactory results
were promising when the Rutherglen bug
plague, which assumed record propor-
tions, reached Crookwell. Potato foliage
on this irrigation plot, so succulent,
attracted the pests in thousands. A failure
resulted. In view of later successful
control methods in Victoria with D.D.T.
dusts, the bug won’t do it again.
Shallow Soil Farming.
“Bill C.”: “Bumpkin’s” experiments (B.
5/6/’46) are all very well, but he was
able to irrigate the land. You can grow
all manner of crops on shallow, stony
land if you can keep plenty of water up
to ’em. That’s why pumpkins and other
vine-crops grow of their own accord in
some localities during rainy seasons.
Briefly, the damp, soft state of the soil
enables plant roots to penetrate deeply
into it and get the plant foods that are
always present in some degree.
It’s a different story when you’re farm-
ing on shallow land without the benefit
of either a generous rainfall or irrigation.
I’ve found that the shallower soils are the
quicker they lose all their moisture in a
drought. And you can’t make shallow,
drought-stricken soils produce better
crops merely by stuffing fertilisers into
’em.
On a Young Pasture.
“Mr.”: Victorian “Journal of Agricul-
ture” points out that, though grazing en-|
courages stooling of grasses and clovers
in a freshly-sown pasture, stocking
should be light and infrequent to allow
the seedlings to recover and build up
strong root ‘ systems. Young cattle are
better than sheep in the early stages. If
the pasture is spelled in the first season
from halfway through the spring the un-
eaten growth protects the soil against
erosion and makes cover for young seed-
lings in autumn. Stocking can be in-
creased after the . first year, but rest
periods will still be needed. Grass will
dominate a pasture if it is stocked
leniently; close grazing, on the other
hand, encourages the clover.
Too frequent mowing exhausts soil fer-
tility, reduces the vigor of plants and lets
weeds in, particularly on poor soils. Fer-
tility will be increased and patches of
rank, unpalatable growth prevented if the
pasture is harrowed at regular intervals.
Still Careless.
“Wallis”: Despite all the talk about
lack of machinery and parts, it’s still
possible to be astonished by the quantity
of farm machinery and implements left
in neglected and exposed positions for
lengthy periods. Sheer laziness, careless-
ness or ignorance is to blame.
With things as they are, I suggest that
such farm machinery as is not in con-
tinual use should be pooled in a com-
munity exchange centre, where it would
be availed of by farmers on a rotation
basis or moved to other districts as the
season demanded. Waste and neglect of
essential machinery at a time of world
starvation are crimes for which there is
no excuse. The taxpayer, called upon
to subsidise the farmer, has a right to
demand that carelessness of this kind be
punished.
Foments and Poultices.
“Plane Creek”; Hot foments followed
by warm poultices are unequalled for
bringing an abscess to a head quickly.
Hot foments draw the blood into the
region of the lump, causing increased
inflammation and swelling, but prevent-
ing the poisonous matter in the tissues
from spreading. Warm poultices carry
on the good work whilst exercising a
drawing influence on the infected matter
or the foreign body in the flesh and
softening the tough skin.
Foments should be really hot. Bathe
the part for at least half an hour three
times daily. If skin is broken, add a few
drops of antiseptic to the water. Apply
the hot water gently with a square of
flannel, having first clipped away all hair.
Grime should be washed, not rubbed,
away. Have a copper of water heating
over a near-by fire, and replenish your
basin from it as the water in use cools
off. After treatment dry the part with
a towel. Rub with oil to keep the parts
warm.
Linseed meal and a little clean bran
make a good poultice. Add boiling water
to the mixture and mix until stiff and
thick. Apply poultice fairly hot directly

Food helped us win the war, and it will help
to win the peace. But huge and urgent pro-
duction programmes call for modern trac-
tion methods at their best. In every type
of primary production, "Caterpillar” Diesel
Tractors, such as the D 2, are providing
power at the lowest cost per working hour, speeding up production, helping win
bigger per acre yields. Wet weather or soft paddocks don’t hold up the man who
owns a "Caterpillar.” "Caterpillar” lets you seed earlier, while others are waiting for
paddocks to dry. On any slope, any soik—hard, wet, or loose—the D 2, with its broad
tracks and 12 inch grousers, rides on top with a ground pressure less than that o a
man’s foot, and without miring or soil-packing! From turning in coyer crops to
pulling the combine, running the saw bench, or digging your dams, "Caterpillar
wUI provide dependable power under even the toughest conditions. Progressive
farmers everywhere depend upon "Caterpillar.”

in contact with the swelling. A many-
tailed bandage will hold a heavy, wet
poultice in position against almost any
part of the horse, but a homemade
“boot” of sacking is necessary when the
trouble lies on the sole of the foot. Ap-
plied firmly, but not too tightly, a poul-
tice will do a lot of good. Every stable
should contain poultice-making material.
Grub Deterrents.
“Sarina”; A fly that is parasitic upon
the northern cane grub has been observed
in N.Q., but farmers and agricultural
experts don’t expect much good from it.
This fly lays its eggs in the soil, and the
maggots search the soil for their hosts—
cane grubs. If they succeed in parasitis-
ing grubs, the latter are killed, but climatic
and soil conditions are all against the
maggots finding hosts in many districts.
They cannot thrive under excessively dry
or wet conditions, and they cannot pene-
trate far into sticky soils.
Some farmers situated at a fair dis-
tance from mountain scrubs where fig-
trees are plentiful have found that grub
damage to their crops has greatly less-
ened following the destruction of all fig-
trees on their farms. Cane beetles don t
frequent country where there are no feed-
ing trees, but it’s no use one man getting
rid of all the figs on his property if his
neighbors won’t follow suit.
Hints for the Farm.
“K.W.R.”: If gate timber for sheep
yards is hard to obtain, try building with
single head-stocks. Gates on this plan
will last as long as the more elaborate
job, as most breakages occur in battens
rather than head-stobks. If you have
many gates to make, the saving in time
and timber will be appreciable. Applica-
tion of coal-tar or paint at regular inter-
vals will double the life of gates.
“Atlanta”: Clean barrels thoroughly
and oil lightly inside and out before re-
turning firearms to their rack. Be sure
to clean barrels again before use, as oil
or obstructions may result in barrel bulge
or other injury. Avoid handling metal-
work any more than necessary —wearing
of the “blue” exposes the metal and
invites rust. Pay particular attention to
weapons in wet weather ; dampness may
cause rust, and don’t lend a gun you
prize ; few will care for it as you do.
“Bogan Joe”; Tomatoes which are
staked should be carefully pruned once
a week. Pull the plant close to the stake
to prevent whipping and injury to plant or
fruit. After three clusters of fruit have
set, pinch out the top bud. Leave two
pairs of leaves to maintain normal growth
as shelter for fruit. Staking, topping and
pruning mean earlier and better friut.
“Big Billy”: It is sound policy to keep
up the super, as far as possible on low
production fields and allow the higher
dressed land to carry on with the residue
of previous dressings until the .super,
position is restored to pre-war levels.
“Bennie”: Mash should be fed to fowls
at a temperature to suit existing weather
conditions.- In cold weather, mix with
warm water, in summer with cool water.
Where this method is practised the fowls
suffer no disturbance to the system.
“P.R.A.N.”: When rearing day-old
chicks, though no food is required for
the first 48 hours, it is good to allow them
exercise on the second day and oppor-
tunity to pick up some fine grit and
charcoal. Main thing is to prevent them
getting a chill through exposure to wind
or by getting their feet wet.
“P”; Make the chicks’ drinkery so that
they cannot get into it. A kerosene-
tin with holes an inch in diameter, \\
inches above the bottom, is very suit-
able. After the first few days some
minced liver fed once or twice a week
will do a lot of good, particularly when
there is no meatmeal in the mash.
Lettuce fed from the second week on-
ward makes for steady progress.
“Marsh”: Money in rabbits! At
recent sales, in Sydney best furred full-
grown bucks made 19s. lid. per pound,
the highest price I ever heard of in Aus-
tralia. The percentage of top pelts would
be small, but at about five to the pound
just on 4s. each is a remarkable return,
i t ’ s a bit different from the days when
we considered ourselves well paid if tops
jealised 6d. per pound. In those days
we reckoned skins at a penny each, and
after freight and selling charges had
been deducted returns would pan out at
about a half-penny.

HANCOCK" Frederick.—Mr. Frederick Hanco ck ,
husband of MARGARET ETHEL HANCOCK, who
died in Perth in 1905, or any person havinfe know

requested to communicate without delay with IRE
Trustees executors and agency company
LIMITED, 401 Collins Street, Melbourne.
with the scenes of poverty and misery he
knew so well in the big cities. He had
done a lot in the big cities in relieving
distress. Nothing boastful here —rather
a broad, vague, general intimation that
carried, nonetheless, quite a vivid impres-
sion of a new St. Vincent de Paul.
“Money! Money! How much evil is
wrought by money, and yet how much
good it can do when rightly applied.”
Greg sighed again, and patted the curly
head still more, and looked sadly right
through this happy world to the squalor
of the big cities. And quite absentmind-
edly ate another scone, and drank another
cup of tea.
But it was clear enough that if Greg
only had the money he could do great
good with it. Great and nobje good.
Just how wasn’t mentioned either, but
Greg’s face told that. Greg’s true voca-
tion was becoming clearer —it was to col-
lect money from those that had it, and
give it to those that hadn’t.
No doubt Greg’s own father, who was
a “blasted old skinflint” when all was
said, didn’t approve of Greg’s great
mission—it mighty cost' him something.
And that accounted for the old man hav-
ing so little to do with Greg.
So Mrs. Doolan, after Greg’s depar-
ture, mopped her face with a portion of
old sheet. (“Youse couldn’t use it for the
beds any more, torn as it was, and
mended agin and agin. And wljen no
one’s about it saves the hankies.”)
“That man’s a saint, I’m telling you,”
she said to Mr. Doolan. “It’s lovely the
way fie speaks to the children, making
their Heavenly Father so real and near
and dear to them, and making no lesson
of it all.”
There yvas a crash and scatter in the
kitchen at this moment, and Mrs. Doolan
waddled in with surprising speed. She
raised her voice to express her deep feel-
ings.
“You blasted brats! At the brown
sugar again! And youse have knocked
down the tin and spilt it on the floor.
You limbs of Satan, youse won’t sit down
for a month! ”
On the still evening air rose the cries
of little children being taught the impor-
tance of leaving the brown sugar alone.
SO money was passed on to Greg, per-
haps not much of it, but the more be-
cause it had to be pressed and forced on
to him. He didn’t want to take it, and
then he sighed out of a full heart, and
thought of those little children in the big
cities. One was made to feel that the
giving was a sharing in saintliness.
It was Greg’s wish on such occasions
that nothing be said about the gift. “Do
good by stealth,” Greg would say, and
one felt that any advertisement would de-
tract even from the intrinsic value of the
money.
As time went on, Greg spent more and
more time over at Fred Rosen’s —trying
to convert him undoubtedly. “And he’ll
do it, too, if anyone can.” He fell into
the creek twice on his return, and when
the log-bridge was put across he even fell
off that. Several times he stayed atlFred’s
all night—it was handy to the cemetery,
he explained afterwards.
Then he didn’t go to Fred’s any more—
which indicated that Fred was obdurate
and stubborn. Instead he took some pious
work to Emil’s cellar, where it was so
cool and spent much of the day there.
Once he fell down the steps as he came
up them. Not a bad fall, just a bit of a
shaking—eyesight not as good as it used
to be.
And then the end came —with startling
suddenness. Emil found Greg asleep on
the cellar floor ; very soundly asleep and
snoring horribly. It was a shock to hear
Greg snore at all.
Greg was near the small and much-
prized cask of verdelho. The bung was
out, and in the bunghole was a very long
oat straw. And in the cask was very little
verdelho. Emil, in the simplicity of his
soul, had been growing tired of Greg and
his pious talk and his reading of Thomas
a Kempis. He fittingly described the loss
of the verdelho as “the last straw.”
He had a quiet private talk to Greg
when Greg had sufficiently waked from
his sound sleep. Some of the phrases of
that quiet talk could be heard a mile
away: “You bloody fat, greasy hypo-
crite ! ” Emil was like that when he spoke
quietly to people. “Greasy,” too, was
most unfair.
Greg left next morning—sadly, quietly,
piously, with the wrongs of the saints
thick upon him. Mrs. Schneider and the
girls wept bitterly at his departure, and
Greg seemed to hint that their tears did
them great credit. They refused to believe
what Emil had been saying. Emil and
the boys were not present to say farewell,
but later Emil declared that a pound note
and 4s. 6d. in silver made their departure
at the same time as Greg.
Greg walked back to tak-
ing in the cemetery and Fred Rosen’s on
the way. He went to Kelly, of the Con-
tingent, and doubtless did much good
among Casey, Alf Pettit, Abe Newton
and others frequently to be found there.
Finally he left the town as quietly as he
had entered it. Presumably he hastened
back to the big cities where the little chil-
dren were so unhappy, and where he
would enter the Church at last.
Old Hare, though much relieved at
Greg’s departure, mourned for many days
—Greg had drunk a boy’s saddle and a
complete set of dray harness during his
sojourn with Kelly. How Greg had man-
aged to come by these things will never
be known.

The Week in Germany.
Monday; In a report to the Milwaukee
“Misfire,” Humperdinck Hack, the
famous foreign correspondent, states there
is nothing more certain than that within
the next three weeks at least 11 million
Germans in the American zone will die.
For months they have been living mainly
on a sauerkraut made from pine needles,
boiled-up forage caps, pigs’ bristles and
“Do hurry up, Harry, or Well miss
afternoon tea!”
the residue from strained sump oil.
Although the subject is mentioned only in
horrified whispers, it is known that canni-
balism has broken out in one Rhineland
town. Hack further asserts that the
continual friction between the British and
American zone commanders in Berlin is
having a devastating effect on the
troops’ morale and is encouraging un-
rest among the civil population. No
British or American soldier dare leave the
safety of barracks for fear of the well-
armed bands of fanatical young Nazis
who roam the streets unchecked. The
bad blood between the two branches of
the Anglo-Saxons is being cleverly ex-
ploited by the Russians, he says.
Tuesday: Cabling from Berlin to the
Chicago “Scorcher,” Clambake Z. Sucker,
whose sensational dispatches from Istan-
bul covering the Russian campaign from
Leningrad to the German border gained
him deathless fame in his home town of
Choctaw Bend (Pa.), says that the young
German men are completely apathetic.
Mothers still stunned by a defeat they
cannot yet fully believe let their children
go unwashed and in rags, with their
houses and themselves unkempt and
bedraggled. The girls make no secret of
their hostility and treat attempts at frater-
nisation coldly. On the other hand, he
says, the men are co-operative, friendly
and well-behaved, especially the youths.
Wednesday: In a dispatch to the Cleve-
land “Daily Yell” Cyrus Q. Beanschpiller
says most Germans in the American zone
are mud-fat and are selling their surplus
food to the half-starved G.ls. at black-
market prices. He states that the Russians
appear worried by their inability to crack
open the strong friendship manifestly
existing between the British and Ameri-
cans. Germans m the Russian
zone, he reveals, are allowed cream
twice a day, unlimited beer, vodka
and cigarettes and are given free
tickets for the Russian ballet.
Many are frantically endeavoring to
smuggle relatives across from the
American zone.
Jhursday; The Houston (Tex.)
“Whizzer” publishes a sensational
report from its correspondent in
Wuppertal confirming the news of
cannibalism in Western Germany.
He says it has been definitely estab-
lished that a young fraulein was the
victim, and that a hungry mob had
literally to be dragged from her half-eaten
body by military police. He reports fur-
ther that the frenzied efforts of emaciated,
tortured wretches to reach the American
from the Russian zone are terrible
to behold, and that the influx is
causing grave concern to the American
authorities, who appealed to the British
for help. It is learned that the British
refusal to assist led almost to a stand-up
fight between the two commanders, this
being the culmination of months of
bottled-up enmity.
Friday: In a press interview the Com-
mander of the American zone, who had
just come from lunch with the British
Commander, told correspondents that
although the food problem still needed
watching civilians in the American zone
were in no danger of starving—in fact,
he had lately been able to increase
slightly the ration calories per person.
There had been no untoward incidents
among civilians, although fraternisation
between troops and girls was causing
some concern. A pleasing feature was the
planner ip whidh German women were
sticking to their traditional pride in the
care of their homes and families. In the
main the men were static. There had
been no attempts at large-scale movements
from any one zone to another. He be-
lieved that the report of cannibalism from
a town in Western Germany originated in
a remark made to a fraulein by a G.I. Joe.
He had said; “Sure, honey, you’re nice
enough to nibble!”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

4£d. per line; all others 2£d. per line.
The Country Storekeeper
Isn’t somebody in authority going to
give the country storekeeper a pat on the
back for the job he did during the war?
He seems to be the only man whose ser-
vices have not been recognised, although
without his loyal co-operation food-
and clothes-rationing wquld have been
doomed to failure. Manpower claimed
most of his staff, but he did wonders with
what little outside help he could get. He
found the coupon system a nightmare ;
it meant working overtime every day of A
the week and without payment. His
commonsense interpretation of various
rules and regulations made things easier
for the Government and the customer.
This isn’t the first time Victorian
country storekeepers have shown their
mettle. They are entitled to a large
measure of credit for the success of
closer settlement in their State. Through
drought and depression they have stood
behind the struggling settler ; some heavy
blows were received and some have had
to take the count. When settlers slipped
away in the night leaving debts unpaid
the storekeepers had to bear the losses.
The “rough justice” scheme of com-
pensation to British overseas settlers
meant no justice at all for the men who
had stood behind them. The disgracefully
small amount granted to soldier-settlers,
compelled by adverse conditions to leave
their holdings, left little or nothing with
which to pay debts. Finally the Debt
Adjustment Act proved to be the last
straw to many.
For better or worse, chain stores are
gradually supplanting the man who has
been not only storekeeper but adviser
and friend. He has done a grand job and
his place will never be filled. — West
Riding (Vic.).
That Palmer River Goldfield
D. Gavin (B. 29/5/’46) takes me to
task, asserting that Mt. Madden and
Mt. Buchanan are not on the Palmer
River (Q.) and that the reefs are not 100
feet wide.
Robert Logan Jack, sometime Govern-
ment geologist, reported that Mt. Madden
is on Oakey Creek, a tributary of Sandy
Creek, which flows into the Palmer River
about 10 miles below .Maytown. I have
walked from Maytown to the camp occu-
pied in 1895 by James Venture Mulligan
(one of the prospectors who found the
Palmer Goldfield), situated at the foot of
Mt. Madden, and just across the creek
from M*t. Buchanan. The mineral deposits
in question are on the Palmer watershed
and in the Palmer River Goldfield area.
Regarding the width of the Mt. Mad-
den deposit, the late R. L. Jack stated
in his report “In a distance of 100yds.
from west to east, I saw three enormous
outcrops of friable and ferruginous
quartz.” My own observations of the
deposits satisfied me that there are surface
formations of a minimum of 100 feet in
width. Assays taken ranged from 15dwt.
to 2oz. 7dwt. gold.
Reports by geologists Walter Colley
and W. L. Wray confirm the enormous
size of these deposits and bulk values of
over lOdwt. gold.— Alex. Strachan (Q.).
Immigrants
I can vouch for the good citizenship of
many Southern Europeans * who have
established businesses in country towns
(B. 19/6/’46). They take an active interest
in everything that is for the benefit of the
district.
All immigrants, however, should be
required to learn English within a definite
time, and the opening of special schools
for them should be prohibited. This
would prevent the establishment of.
foreign minority cells and avert the
troubles that have been so evident in
Queensland.
Only by attending Australian schools
can young immigrants be taught the Aus-
tralian way of life.— Recco (N.S.W.),
Soldiers
“Zabut’s” scheme for the formation of
an Australian Army in 1939 (B. 19/6/’46)
would have fallen at the first fence —the
mobilisation parade when those not
wishing to serve overseas could fall out
and report. On one such parade held in
1939 only seven of 700 troops volunteered
for the A.I.F, There is only one practical
and fair way of forming an army and that
is by general conscription.—B. J. L. (Q.).
The recent revelation that many Aus-
tralians only kid themselves they’re heroes
has brought caustic comment from lead-
ing Army men. But the fact remains that
an untrained and undisciplined soldier
can’t face up to a trained enemy. Not
that he is necessarily a coward, but his un-
trained mind is inclined to panic.
We need trained men in this country,
and our only guarantee that, we will
possess a trained army is re-introduction
of compulsory military training. Within
a decade, servicemen of the last war will
have lost their youth, and the defence of
our shores will fall mainly on the
shoulders of today’s youngsters. — Jeff
(Vic.).
Preference to Trainees
Three months ago, on discharge, I
applied for a full-time art course at a
technical college under the Common-
wealth Reconstruction Training Scheme.
I was told that as it was halfway through
a term, and the course was full anyway,
I’d have to wait till someone dropped out
or a new class commenced. To call is to
receive the same answer—“ Still crowded
out, but we’ve got you on the waiting
list.”
Friends doing similar courses have an-
other story. A large proportion of the
students are girls. Some are in earnest
and work ha*d; others are no-hopers,
'slack in attendance though looking very
arty and decorative. No one seems to
worry, provided Daddy keeps their fees
up to scratch. «
I don’t mind women making careers
for themselves, but I do object to merely
“naice” girls cluttering up classes while
“Are you going to make a fourth at bridge—or aren’t you?”
ex-servicemen, eager for training, are
forced to wait around for months living
on their deferred pay.— Red (N.S.W.).

War Prosperity
In August, 1942, the National City
Bank of New York in its monthly report
on business conditions wrote:
Many present economic policies undoubt-
edly would be different if all groups of
the people realised that war is not a con-
dition of prosperity, in which they may
aspire to a greater share. On the con-
trary, war in its effect on living standards
is a state of depression, however the fact
ma y be obscured to the general view by
high industrial activity, high payrolls and
farm income and the recognised busi-
ness indexes. There is no “melon” of in-
creased production of goods and services to
be cut’; instead, the supply of the necessi-
ties and comforts of life to be divided is
smaller.
In the course of the same report the
bank pointed out that the established
peace-time standards of many millions of
people were reduced by war. These in-
eluded the men in the armed forces, the
white collar and professional workers, un-
organised .labor, pensioners, small busi-
nessmen and all others whose taxes and
living costs rose more than their incomes,
Though we have seen the end of the
war, we have not yet seen the end of the
conditions outlined above. And we won’t
enjoy higher living standards unless we
produce a “melon of increased production
to be cut.” —Student (W.A.).
_
Ward Line?
Tucked away at the bottom of
the Parkes (N.S.W.) “Champion-Post”
(11/6/’46) lies the first announcement of
the Ward Defence Line. At the Victory
Day celebrations in that town the Mayor
let go a secret that should burst for ever
the “Brisbane Line” bubble:
After the fall of Rabaul in 1942, Army
Intelligence discovered that the Japanese
intended to complete the conquest of
New Guinea and then make a landing
on t jj e west coas t of Australia. After con-
solidating there they proposed to move
through S.A., skirt Broken Hill and gam
control of the central N. S. Wales railway
system by capturing Parkes.
All this had been revealed to him [the
Mayor] when he was called to Sydney for
a secret conference with Government
officials and Army leaders towards the end
of 1942. He had been told then that it
was intended, if a landing were made in
Australia, to establish a defensive line of
Australian troops between Parkes and Con-
dobolin, and he was given instructions to
make preparations for this eventuality.
The Parkes-Condobolin line would have
meant abandoning the whole of Westralia,
S.A., the N.T., most of Queensland, half
of N. S. Wales and part of Victoria. In
preparation for the Ward Line the
Curtin Government had large supply
bases established at Parkes and Dubbo,
fuel depots put down at many points in
Central N. S. Wales, a large airfield with
several runways constructed at Roto
(west of Condobolin) in 1942, and one of
the largest air bases in Australia estab-
lished at Tocumwal.
When this was completed Ward and
company invited General George Kenny,
commanding the air arm under General
MacArthur, to inspect. “Mighty fine base,
but put it two thousand miles closer to
the enemy,” was the general’s flattening
verdict, which caused the Wards to
abandon this £2,000,000 venture as an
operational base.
Mr. Ward invented the fable of the
“Brisbane Line” to destroy the reputation
of his political opponents. His own
leader, Mr, Curtin, admitted that General
Iven Mackay’s defence plan report was
submitted to his Government, not to the
Menzies or Fadden Governments. Messrs.
Menzies, Fadden, Hughes, Spender and
McEwen, as members of the Advisory War
Council, must have known of the prepara-
tions for the Parkes-Condobolin line,
and kept their oaths of secrecy. Pre-
sumably Mr. Ward realised that they
would do this when he concocted his Line
—and lie—K. Me. (N.S.W.).
“Seven Guineas a Week”
An interesting Adelaide item was an
advertisement for a secretary of the S.A.
Gas Union at “Seven guineas a week, sub-
ject to variation in cost of living, plus 6s.
a week war loading.”
Significant is the discrepancy between
the union secretary’s pay envelopie and
that of the ordinary wage-plug.
When will the rank and file realise that
the man who is eternally mouthing “Com-
rades,” and who receives two guineas a
week more than they, has nothing in
common with them? —A. D. (S.A.).
Mopping-up Campaigns
Half-hearted attempts to force an in-
quiry into those seemingly useless mop-
ping-up campaigns in the islands have
apparently fizzled out. It is hard for
people who lost dear ones to appreciate
the importance of those campaigns. As
one who saw men die attacking Japs at
Bougainville, I cannot see that their lives
advanced the final victory one iota. With
many others I would welcome an official
explanation.
It was common knowledge among men
of the divisions concerned that the Jap
capitulation stopped the opening of yet
another island campaign. Rabaul, where
90,000 Japs were dug in with abundant
supplies and ammunition and with
hundreds of acres under cultivation, was
to be attacked by two Australian divi-
sions. A natural fortress strengthened
and developed to the utmost despite Allied
bombing, and of no use to the enemy’s
tottering homeland, Rabaul would have
been the end of the road for many Aus-
tralians.
It is wrong that relatives of men killed
at Bougainville, Wewak and such places
should be left nursing resentment against
“the authorities.” The least they deserve
is an assurance that each campaign was
an integral part of the war plan—and
why it was. — Bondi Beachcomber
(N.S.W.).
“The Man Who Was Right”
Support for The Bulletin leader (B.
15/5/ ’46) is contained in a booklet issued
by the British Railways Press Office.
Here are extracts:
The first call came in June, 1937, when
the War Office asked the London, Midland
and Scottish Railway to carry out the de-
sign of a medium tank.
As early as July, 1938, the carriage var-
nish shop in the York Carriage and Waggon
Works was set aside for the production and
assembly of Botha parts.
The Southern entered the field of aircraft
production in October, 1938, soon after the
Munich Conference, when the decision was
made to convert Blenheim bombers to
fighters.
In October, 1938, also, the L.M.S. under-
took the making of aircraft wings, the
first of which were for Hurricane machines.
So it seems that Hitler did not fool
Neville Chamberlain after all, and Chur-
chill knew it' when he formed his first
Ministry.— Rob (Vic.).
More Australian Gold!
If Mr. Chifley had £100,000,000-worth
of gold he would not be worried about
his shortage of American dollars; and
he could have had it. Instead of trying
to get it the Government in which he was
Treasurer closed down most of the mines
by manpower requisitions, plus a gold
tax imposed by a previous Government.
Increased gold production is one of our
greatest needs and we should pay £ls
an ounce for gold. You might say that
is subsidising, but actually it is not. It
is admitted that gold is the best medium
for backing the paper currency. If we
built up our gold reserve to £200,000,000,
we could safely issue currency to the
value of £350,000,000.
For each ounce of gold placed in the
Treasury we are adding about £lO to our
real credit. For this £lO we would pay
£ls in paper money.
If our gold reserve is low, ex-
xhange will be high. The acquiring
of gold at £ls an ounce means
building up a sound world credit and
establishing funds to assist primary and
secondary industries without borrowing
or taxing for this purpose. At £ls an
ounce there would soon be a large supply
of gold, for the price would admit of
many low-grade shows in all the main-
land States and the Northern Territory
being worked or reworked.
I would pay £ls an ounce for 20 years
and exempt goldmining profits from in-
come tax. Then we should have new
finds, and among the good effects, which
would begin to be felt immediately, a
great expansion of primary and secon-
dary industries with the avoidance of in-
flation and national insolvency.
There is no economist who can truth-
fully say that a gold basis is not prefer-
able to Treasury bills and other devious
means of “raising credit.”
“Asked why South Africa was able to
end petrol rationing” (I quote a Canberra
message), “Mr. Dedman said that South
Africa was a large producer of gold, and
gold enabled it to obtain more dollars
than Australia could.” A powerful argu-
ment for increasing our gold production,
though this Minister did not intend it as
such. With ample gold reserves the Gov-
ernment could import the goods we sorely
need, and would not have to give free
rides in warships and ’planes to buyers
of or subscribers to £lO bonds. — Jas. G.
Peterson (N.S.W.).
New Guinea’s Capital
When “Merlin” said that land trans-
port to both coasts of New Guinea was
a necessity which did not exist for an
inland capital site (B. 15/5 / ’46) he was
apparently forgetting Wau. Thousands
of Australian Army sappers will never
do that. The famous Bulldog-Wau road,
70 miles long and reaching 9857 feet
above sea-level, links the inland gold-
mining centre with the southern coast.
Another road was built from Wau north-
ward to the mouth of the Markham
River, opposite Lae.
Except for the unsightly mess made by
gold dredges, Wau is well suited to be a
capital. Its valley is fertile and it has a
pleasant climate and attractive scenery.
It is also a central spot easily accessible
by air from Port Moresby, and from
important New Guinea trading centres to
the north. . . . ,
Yet the former engineer -in - cmer,
A.M.F., Major-General C. S. Steel, has
declared that the road to Bulldog, built
with enormous physical exertion and witn
loss of life, has been allowed to deteri-
orate so far that it would be difficult to
find today. The ingenuity and hard work
of our engineers provided something de-
clared impossible in peace-time. It should
not be wasted, particularly as W
promises to be the richest town m New
Guinea. — A- J. M- (Vic.),


The R.A.A.F.
Air Vice-Marshal W. D. Bostock
was the R.A.A.F.’s senior operational
commander and did an excellent job. His
newspaper articles on the service are not
to be ignored.
The essence of his criticism was com-
mon knowledge throughout the R.A.A.F.
To unify Air Forces in the S.W.P.A. Mr.
Curtin, after discussion with President
Roosevelt, agreed to place the R.A.A.F.
in that area under the control of the U.S.
Army Air Force Chief, Lt.-Gen. Brett.
War Cabinet decided that “all operational
units of the R.A.A.F., including the head-
quarters concerned with such units and
the administration, maintenance and
supply organisation to keep the opera-
tional units at their maximum efficiency,
should come under the direct control of
the Commander Allied Air Forces.”
But Mr. Drakeford, as Minister for Air,
interpreted that as “retention by R.A.A.F.
Headquarters of all matters such as per-
sonnel, provision and maintenance of air-
craft, supply and equipment, works and
buildings and training of the R.A.A.F.”
Naturally R.A.A.F. Headquarters sup-
ported him, and, when Lt.-Gen. Kenny,
who succeeded Brett, wanted the R.A.A.F.
grouped into a single organisation under
a single command, all he got was the
establishment of R.A.A.F. Command
“created in 1942 to exercise operational
command of all R.A.A.F. operational for-
mations and operational units” (Air
Force Confidential Order 44/43). The
resulting set-up was fantastic and de-
scribed by General MacArthur as “com-
pletely violative of sound military prin-
ciples.”
The arrangement meant that R.A.A.F.
Command, of which Bostock was Air
Officer Commanding, came directly under
the operational control of the Allied Air
Forces Commander, but also under the
administrative control of R.A.A.F. Head-
quarters, Melbourne. It also meant that
Western Area, Northern Command,
North-western Area, Eastern Area,
Southern Area, 1st T.A.F. and 11 Ops.
Group came under the operation control
of R.A.A.F. Command in Brisbane, but
under the administrative control of
R.A.A.F. Headquarters in Melbourne.
It was an impossible arrangement. The
divided control produced friction,
anomalies, conflicting instructions and
bitter personal hatreds and jealousies.
Not only did Melbourne grab the opera-
tional functions of R.A.A.F. Command,
but it fell down badly in its selected field
of administration.
There were many extremely capable
officers in R.A.A.F. Headquarters,
Victoria Barracks, Melbourne. But there
were also in that over-populated warren
many who could have served the
R.A.A.F. better by washing dishes in
messes. Bostock bitterly records a
long list of administrative failures,
of airstrips built needlessly or 12
months too late, of orders so lacking
in knowledge of operational requirements
that they crippled or severely handicapped
the work of R.A.A.F. Command.
R.A.A.F. Command had its faults, too,
but it must fairly receive credit for direct-
ing the fighting side of the R.A.A.F. in
the S.W.P.A. The Americans were satis-
fied with Bostock’s command and co-
operation and said so ; their opinion of
R.A.A.F. Headquarters was often ex-
pressed, but never printed. When they
wanted some Australian pilots they were
told they would have to take some of the
Australian administrative set-up with
them. They declined very smartly.
Reams could be written about the dis-
organisation produced by divided control
during the war, and bureaucratic control
remains. Highly-qualified officers with
fine operational and administrative
records were refused commissions in the
Permanent Air Force, while others who
faced aptitude tests, interview boards and
whatnot went away wondering just what
the P.A.F. required—if anything.
Mr. Drakeford’s hand is evident in
much of the confusion and he appears
to have contributed largely to the initial
causes. It is allowed that he must have
been a good engine-driver.— Oliver
Filter (N.S.W.).
Commissioned Aircrew
The worst result*of commissioning air
crew on completion of their service train-
ing was the arrival oh operations of
newly-commissioned men who were senior
to n.c.os. with many operations to their
credit. The only fair thing would have
been to make them all sergeants on
graduation, leaving selection for com-
missions until “the potentials” had proved
their capacity for leadership in opera-
tions.
As an escort officer I found that the
young aircrew officer had not the slightest
conception of his duties as an officer.
During the whole of his 10 months’ train-
ing he was not given one single hour’s in-
struction on the duties and responsibili-
ties of officer rank, and it took many
months in the field before he developed
the capacity for leadership.
This lack of training was repeatedly
reported by unit training officers to the
powers that be, but nothing ever hap-
pened.—C. G. I. (N.S.W.).
Eighth Division. M.Os.
I hope that the 0.8. E. awarded Briga-
dier Blackburn, V.C., C.O. of Blackforce
in Java in 1942, is the forerunner of a
list of decorations and awards for the
Eighth Div. The Eighth stopped thinking
of medals some years ago, but outstand-
ing medical officers like Lt.-Colonel
Coates, Lt.-Colonel Dunlop, Major Cor-
lette and others should receive some
recognition for the work they did.
Some maintain that p.-0.-w. are ineli-
gible for honors, but the Eighth men
argue that under international law medi-
cal personnel are not p.-0.-w. If the
“rescue our brave boys!” attitude of the
Australian public was genuine, the
men who should be honored are those to
whom we owe our survival—the m.os.
These men did their jobs in the face of
the enemy, in defiance of the enemy and
completely in the power of the enemy,
with frequent bashings and threats of
death to discourage them.
It will be a bad show if Australia lets
them go unrecognised.— Simon Scrawler
(Vic.).
The Gyppo
The presence of Empire troops round
the Nile delta may have been “a major
factor in Egypt’s prosperity” (B.
29/5/’46), but none of that prosperity
has raised the standard of living among
working people. They were better off on
two and three piastres a day than they are
“You have an irritation somewhere
“That’s right, doc. —the wife an six kids!”
now on ten piastres, the average daily
wage since the war started.
Egyptians blame the large number of
British troops in Egypt for the unequal
rise in the cost of living. Those street
wallahs with wallets and postcards may
have reaped a rich harvest, but many
of them were there in pre-war days and
got good pickings from tourists. The
“eggs-a-bread” boys never got rich from
Empire custom —soldiers were warned off
their wares, anyhow. It was the hungry,
peasant-class Gyppo who bought that
“munga.”
Egypt’s “fighting-mad soldiers” are
vastly different from the ones “Zake”
knew. They are learning the use of
modem weapons, and becoming remark-
ably proficient—l watched them before I
left Cairo in March, and I’ll wager they’ll
give a good account of themselves if
called upon to defend the Canal.
“What did they do to help us in the
war?” More than Eire, Spain and the
Turks, anyway.—O. W. W. (M.L.).
Australian Writers
It may be too much to expect all pub-
lishers to pay for MSS. on acceptance (B.
19/6/’46), but writers should never have
to claim payment for major contributions
after publication. If the name and
address of a contributor are known, surely
payment could be automatic once the
material has been used. In his efforts to
sell his MSS. a freelance scatters them
far and wide, and, as “R.E.” says, often,
waits months for their appearance in
print. He risks missing payment unless
he watches for his work week after week
—an almost impossible task if he has
many MSS. out
There is another small service which
could easily be given to writers. Accept-
ance of a MS. by many publications is
acknowledged merely by failure to return.
The writer then assumes that it has
“clicked” (of course it may have gone
astray in the post, or been mislaid on an
editorial desk), but publication is the
first definite confirmation. As a token of
acceptance couldn’t the stamped envelope,
usually enclosed with each MS., be re-
turned empty with the publication’s
rubber stamp on the flap? A systematic
freelance could easily identify the MS.
to which each referred. —T. S. H. (N.S.W.).
Emigrants
“What will be the good of Australia if
the present mob wins at the next elec-
tions?” asked an aircrew friend recently
returned from Britain. “Fm for England
or Canada if that happens.”
Eve heard similar statements from many
like him, and a voluble dislike of what
they had found in Australia after living
among Britons and Canadians.
We have the material for greatness, as
two wars have shown. How many Aus-
tralians will have read “The Sergeant of
the Eighth” (B. 12/6/’46) with, honest tears
in their eyes, and what uncounted thou-
sands felt their hearts tight with pride in
the men who filled our troopships?
But emotions, however good, are not
enough. Unless we can offer these men
something worth while, or see that they
take a hand in running their country, we’ll
have failed them as conspicuously as they
stood by us in the last few years.—E. G.
(Tas.).
Waste
Visiting Tasmania recently, a Mel-
bourne citizen saw thousands of tons of
apples rotting under the trees in the
orchards. Passing on to the potato dis-
tricts he saw hundreds of tons of potatoes
rotting in the ground or being fed to pigs
because of “second growth”—enlarge-
ment of the spuds which does not render
them less palatable.
The visitor, an inquisitive man, learnt
that the apples had to rot because the
Apple and Pear Board, while it pays for
apples on the tree, pays nothing for the
fruit when picked if it can’t be exported.
In the meantime apples in Tasmanian
shops are 4d. to 6d. a pound and de-
hydration factories are idle.
The murphy position is that farmers
are compelled to leave the spuds in the
ground. There they will be paid for, but
if they are lifted without bureaucratic in-
struction there is no guarantee of pay-
ment.
The Victorian has since been wondering
how Government-imposed waste and
Government appeals for increased pro-
duction have got into the same bed to-
gether.—Lord Luvus (Vic,).
The Vilderbeestes
In “What About Java?” (B. 29/5/’46)
there was mention of “Blackforce,” but
not of the Vilderbeeste men, who did
more damage to the Japanese than any
other air-force unit on the island.
Throughout the campaigns in Malaya,
Singapore and Java No. 36 and No. 100
squadrons (R.A.F.) were flying obsolete
Vilderbeeste aircraft with a speed of
about 90 m.p.h. and with a defensive
armament of only one Lewis gun. The two
squadrons were constantly engaged—on
torpedo- and dive-bombing, convoy-escort-
ing, dropping of supplies, anti-submarine
patrols, photographic and meteorological
trips. Among the air-crews were Australian
observers and wireless air-gunners who
joined the squadrons at Seletar aerodrome
in Singapore towards the end of 1941.
After one daylight attack on the Jap-
anese landing at Endau, on the east coast
of Malaya, 41 crew members out of 71
failed to return and many of those who
did were seriously wounded. Of the
second flight of 12 machines to raid the
target on that occasion, only one was able
to reach the objective, so great was the
concentration of enemy fighters.
The end of the Malaya campaign saw
the two squadrons with only 10 of their
42 machines. The 10 left Singapore for
Palembang in Sumatra on the day that
the causeway to Johore was blown up.
From Palembang to Batavia they had to
navigate with rough maps sketched in
pencil on sheets of notepaper.
After a few days in Batavia they were
moved to Kalidjati. It was on this aero-
drome that almost the entire force of
Blenheim and Hudson bombers were cap-
tured a few days later by the Japanese.
While at Kalidjati the Vilderbeestes were
waiting on standby with torpedoes for the
Japanese landing fleet to come within
their range. Since the torpedoes were
quite unserviceable it was fortunate that
the fleet did not come within range.
At the time of the Japanese landing the
eight remaining Vilderbeestes made two
sorties each, dive-bombing from 200 feet
the landing fleet of about 60 ships which
were drawn up in rows off Rembang.
Three ships were sunk, several severely
damaged, a number of barges were des-
troyed, and the troops forming up on the
beach were machine-gunned. This attack
was not made without considerable losses
and among those who did not return was
the CO. —the fifth up to this time.
Throughout the campaign in Java, faci-
lities for repairing and servicing the air-
craft were very primitive. Structural re-
pairs were done with pieces of bamboo,
tail wheels were stuffed with grass, and
one aircraft which had lost a few inches
off the tip of its propellor had to have
the other end knocked off to prevent the
machine from vibrating.
Just before the capitulation, the squad-
ron having been reduced to one service-
able aircraft, a bombing trip to Kalidjati
was made by the single machine —two
sorties in the one night!
The Vilderbeestes were the last Allied
aircraft to come out of action. They had
been the first to go in. R.A.F. staff offi-
cers maintained that they did more
damage than any other unit to the fall
of Java. Although a special commenda-
tion came from Wavell, not one man
from either of the squadrons received a
decoration, posthumously or otherwise.
The last two aircraft flew off from
Tasikmalaja airfield on the day of the
capitulation in a vain attempt to find a
trading lugger in which the crews could
escape to Ceylon. They planned to put
one aircraft down in the water beside the
vessel while the other circled overhead
in case there should be any trouble in
boarding. When the first crew had
boarded and taken control the second
was to put 'down alongside.
Unfortunately no vessel was sighted,
both machines crash-landed in the sea
off the coast of Sumatra and five of the
eight survivors were captured.
Thus ended the tragic but proud career
of the two squadrons. The few who sur-
vived the campaign were all captured.
Today, after years spent in Japanese coal-
mines and on the Thailand railway, the
number of those alive to tell the tale
barely reaches double figures—A. K. W.
(Vic.).
Employer and Employee
It would be a good thing if the worker
could be brought to understand the re-
sponsibilities borne by the employer. It
might engender some respect in the
worker’s mind and assist him to a more
conscientious attitude in industrial affairs.
When strikes occur there are men who
walk off the job with a feeling of mali-
cious pleasure that the boss will be incon-
venienced.
The boss is regarded, not as a normal
human being who has achieved a measure
of material success by virtue of his ability
and his determination, but as a “capital-
ist” who must be opposed at every turn.
The atttitude is irrational and mean. Re-
sentment should not enter into industrial
relations. The worker should realise that
his economic interests are bound up with
the prosperity of the business in which
he is employed. He should take an active
and intelligent interest in the progress of
the business (for purely selfish reasons).
He certainly should not allow himself to
be led into a resentful attitude towards
the man who pays his wages.
Australian industry stands today ort
the threshold of an era of development.
Friction within industry will retard pro-
gress. Conversely, co-operation and
teamwork will permit quick and smooth
expansion. Our industries have already
achieved a tradition of technical skill. We
must now strive to create another tradi-
tion, a tradition of mutual respect and
co-operation between employer and em-
ployee. — Blue (Q.).,
Complete Surrender
The Chifley Government has become a
party to the Communist war against
the Dutch—Australia no longer trades
with them, refuses to load or repair their
ships and greets them with hooligan
demonstrations. Ministers took an
oath to maintain law, order and good
government, but having surrendered their
power they have become puppets for
Commo union bosses.
The Menzies-Fadden Government im-
posed a ban on the Communist party and
its publications. It refused to be
browbeaten by hooligan mobs, strikes and
threats of strikes. Eighty per cent, of
the new candidates for the Country and
Liberal parties are Diggers, a term
synonymous with, courage. The Commo
blatherskite knows he will be curbed if
Menzies and Fadden regain power,—
F. D. (N.S.W.).
