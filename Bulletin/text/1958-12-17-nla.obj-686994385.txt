SYDNEY SOLICITOR
The George Allen who is the subject
of the biography Early Georgian, by
Dundas Allen (Angus and Robertson),
had, as was proper to the founder of
one of Australia’s earliest and longest-
lived legal firms, complicated family
relationships; and although he arrived
in Australia at the age of 15, it was
because of the law.
He was the fifth son of the second
marriage of Richard Allen, one of the
Prince Regent’s doctors, who died leav-
ing his second wife and her children
practically penniless. She then married
Thomas Collicott, a former surgeon’s-
mate who had been managing her hus-
band’s business of selling medicines;
he was a widower with a son and two
daughters.
For not putting duty-stamps on
medicine-bottles, Collicott was sen-
tenced to be hanged. The sentence
having been commuted to transporta-
tion, Collicott and his wife, with three
of her children, Richarda, Richard and
George, and the three Collicott
children, came to New South Wales in
1816.
In 1817 George was articled to
Frederick Garling, of Sydney, attorney-
at-law. His stepfather, spoken of in
the articles as a merchant of Sydney
(dispensing “rum, gin and beer, and
even then only in a small way, with an
even smaller measure of success”), was
in 1819 appointed, with his wife,
master and matron of the Female
Orphan Institution at Parramatta. His
stepfather’s son, J. T. Collicott, who
had had a farm at the Five Islands,
went to work for a merchant in Hobart,
and there, in 1821, Mr. and Mrs.
Collicott followed him.
About this time George Allen joined
the Methodist Society; and after 1822,
when he became “the first solicitor to
be admitted in N. S. Wales who had
served the whole of his articles in the
colony,” looking after the affairs of the
clergy seems to have made a good part
of his practice. In 1823, at the age of
22, he married Jane Bowden, who was
still under 16. A year and a half before
she had caused him anguish in his
diary;—
Oh what a dire plot I have this day
discovered. A wicked young woman
whose name I forbear to mention,
has been trying to set me against her
whom I loved and still do love as
dear before, and her against me.
She had nearly completed task
on the mind of the female, but
though I heard her slander and
though I listened to her self-created
tale, I could not believe that Jane
could be the false —the deceitful —
girl she wished to represent her to
be . . .
Jane made-up for this torture of
mind by bearing him 14 children.
They early moved to his “estate at
Surry Hills,” a mere one- or two-
hundred acres on the south side of
Oxford Street between Wentworth
Avenue and Taylor Square. This farm
being “too far out” from his office in
Macquarie Street, he sold it to Edward
Riley for £5OO, and took a cottage in
Elizabeth Street on the site of Uni-
versity Chambers; and in 1829 bought
96 acres of St. Phillip’s Glebe, began a
farm there, put up a temporary chapel
where Wesleyan ministers held services,
and by 1831 had put up the Toxteth
Park mansion, which, drawn by Morton
Herman as it probably was before
Verge’s architecture was added to,
forms the double title-page of the book.
It is now a Catholic girls’ school; “with
rows of houses on the cricket-ground
and gardens, and night-trotting and
greyhound racing (Harold Park race-
course) in the orchard.”
Member of the original board of
directors of the Australian Gas Light
Company, elected alderman at the
incorporation of Sydney in 1842,
Mayor of Sydney and magistrate in
1845; non-elective Member of the
Legislative Council from 1846 to
1873; he retired when his sight began
to fail in 1873, and in 1877 he was
bome to the family vault at Rookwood
by the Lieutenant-Governor, the Chief
Justice, the President of the Legislative
Council and a judge of the Supreme
Court
The selections from Allen’s diary,
which form the backbone of the book,
throw quite a bit of color on the
records of early Sydney.
Here we see Mr. Commissioner Bigge
sitting on the bench in the Governor’s
Court “in a brown surtout coat and
striped trousers”; we hear of the ignor-
ance and drunkenness and the quarrel-
some dispositions of the persons at the
Halfway House between Sydney and
Parramatta; are shocked by the “very
mysterious and cruel and sanguinary”
stabbing of his “friend and brother Mr.
Robert Howe” by a man with a rusty
bayonet broken at the point; note that
his friend Jenkins caught a deer, “a
fine large doe, as big as a calf,” that
had been hunted out of a Drummoyne
(Sydney Harborside) estate; observe
that tickets for public dinners are 30s.
or 40s. “for a dinner that is less
worth fourteen pence than at any
Sunday ordinary.”
We are put present at the meeting in
October, 1821, to consider an address
and subscribe a gold cup to Governor
Macquarie, where, address and cup
having been voted with great fervor, the
signatories of the address refused to go
to Government House and present it in
the company of emancipists, and left it
to three emancipists, who had not
signed it, to present. We accompany
Allen on countiy rides, on one where
he loses his horse, and on another where
he finds it. We wade out with him for
about half-a-mile in the Cockle Bay
shallows up to our knees to get a
rowing-boat in which to take the
mistress of die late Superintendent of
Police aboard the schooner Black
Joke
But half the charm of the book is in
his great-grandson’s presentation. Far
from, as he puts it, “letting George
do it,” Dundas Allen has brought at
least as much to the preparation of the
case as he has been given; and the way
he takes his ancestor through his
evidence might serve as a model for
literary gents as well as lawyers.

CANBERRA CABINET
'T'HE Federal Ministry of 1958
contains only six members of the
Ministry of 1950. It must have been a
very difficult one to choose in view of
the need for an almost complete
reshuffle of senior portfolios, the pro-
vision of a Minister for Defence who
would satisfy public opinion, and
especially of a Treasurer who would
satisfy the Country party, Parliament
and the business world.
The selection of Ministers to satisfy
State jealousies in the light of the
very uneven quality of representatives
of various States was no easy matter.
Neither was the choice of men from
the Country party in view of its dearth
of outstanding ability. The restive and
vigorous back-bench of the Liberal
party was a rather unnerving sight for
Cabinetmakers, too.
The theory of Cabinet-selection
naturally tends to produce centralisa-
tion. For all practical purposes of
policy-making on everyday national
business the Commonwealth is in the
hands of Victorians, with Mr. Menzies
as Prime Minister, Mr. McEwen as
Minister for Trade. Mr. Holt as
Treasurer and Mr. R. G. Casey as
Minister for External Affairs. Except
for the Treasurership, which might
reasonably have gone to someone with
more appropriate experience, these
allocations were inevitable.
Even if there had been a different
Treasurer he would almost inevitably
have been another Victorian —Mr.
McEwen.
nrHE important Defence Ministry
-*■ goes to Mr. Athol Townley, who
had a brilliant and adventurous war
record in the R.A.N.V.R., and v/ill be
all the better for that, since he will give
the job the drive which it needs at the
moment. The three service Ministries
which go on Cramer (Army),
Osborne (Air) and Senator Gorton
(R.A.N.) —are little better than under-
secretaryships, . but the Constitution
does not allow of their demotion. They
would be better for a concentration
of authority. But Mr. Townley will
probably apply his personality to the
task of welding their purpose.
C'OME people associated with the
service departments seem to have
forgotten that the ultimate purpose of
each of them is the mutual defence of
Australia against the enemy and not
the defence of one faction in the
department against another or of one
department against another.
So far no device at the top has suc-
ceeded in liquidating the illusions of
warring sections or of persuading all
of those who form the services that
the ultimate objective of defence
organisation is to build-up primarily
fighting-forces and not primarily aggre-
gations of clerks and other hangers-on
with somb incidental fighting-forces
attached to them.
Mr. Adermann, who has been Chair-
man of Committees, assumes the office
of Minister for Primary Production,
which, in its relation to the Department
of Trade, is very much like that of the
service Ministries in relation to the
Defence Department.
Mr. Hasluck has made the Depart-
ment of Territories important, and it
has become his mission in life. It
would be unthinkable that he should
not be in the inner Cabinet, having
regard to his wide experience of world
politics and personalities. And there
must be general approval of the inclu-
sion of C. Wi Davidson, the P.M.G.,
a much abler and better administrator
and counsellor than his unobtrusive
exterior sometimes suggests. Mr.
Downer, by a brilliant novitiate,
assured himself of his promotion.
Nobody could better deserve his
rise. And it was a sine qua non that
if Sir Garfield Barwick would accept
the Attorney-Generalship and become
the junior of the senior Ministers the
job was his for the asking, especially
in a Parliament which will have to
deal with important Constitutional-
reform programmes which may alter
the whole shape and nature of Federa-
tion and the relationship between the
Commonwealth and the States.
Probably because of the nature of
his new fortfolio, Mr. McMahon has
been promoted in the Cabinet. He
will need to prove his qualifications for
the Ministry for Labor and National
Service, which call for very special
qualities and manner of applying them.
It is hard to understand why, in
a country which is frankly a Welfare
State and whose Health Minister
has such wide responsibilities, Dr.
Cameron is not in the senior Cabinet.
Certainly, in view of the fact of the
huge expenditures involved in social
services, running into an amount equal
to nearly two-fifths of the Consolidated
Revenue, it would seem right that one
of the two Ministers connected with
Health and Social Services should have
been in the Cabinet —either Mr.
Roberton or Dr. Cameron, both of
whose departments have run satisfac-
torily, and both with huge problems
ahead in the event of recession.
The new importance of the Senate
in the current year has been marked
following the retirement of Senator
O’Sullivan, the Government leader,
through ill-health, and by the promo-
tion of Senator Spooner, who, as Vice-
President of the Executive Council and
Minister for National Development,
will certainly bring something to
Senate leadership.
He has one Cabinet Senator (Palt-
ridge, Transport and Shipping) and two
junior Ministers —Henty in the de-
moted Customs and Excise Depart-
ment, and Gorton, Navy (a token job),
behind him.
It is a pity,, in view of his common-
sense and experience and the excellent
job he has done in Development and
particularly in the coal-industry, that
he is not in the Lower House. As it
is, however, he gives the Government
the advantage of an island of strength
in the Senate.
TN all there are 12 Cabinet members
and 10 junior Ministers —roughly one
Minister in nine members of the two
Houses, which is altogether too much
by the standards of other countries
and Commonwealth nations.
The set-up seems to need searching
examination in relation to Constitu-
tional and electoral reform. It is time
that Federal electorates were reduced
in size to increase the representation
in the Lower House, which is less than
half the size of the Canadian House
of Commons. Electorates are now
becoming so large that there is diffi-
culty in members keeping contact with
their constituents or efficiently
handling the volume of business which
passes through their offices on depart-
mental matters. These take-up too
much of their time—so much that few
of them have leisure to devote to what
should be their primary objective:
good legislation.
The division of the Ministry between
the two Houses also does not make for
efficiency in a Cabinet or Ministry. It
is usually the case that Senators are
chosen Ministers only because some-
body, by custom, must be chosen. Often
they block-out, as they have in the
present Ministry, infinitely superior
men on the back-benches of the Lower
House.
This is a matter which it is difficult
to cure and which is perhaps incurable,
but the whole status and functions of
the Senate and its relation to Minis-
terial politics require a thorough
going-over.


IN DARKEST TEST-LAND
“Mr. Bailey, I presume?”


PLAIN ENGLISH
Unhappy New Year
The A.L.P. over all Australia, and the
Cahill Labor party in N.S.W. (a
haughty fraction which isolated itself as
much as possible during the Federal
election campaign from the Evatt section
in the hope of persuading Catholic votes
to follow it and the D.L.P. to retire to
the forest during its own campaign to
come), seem to' have a year of real
trouble ahead of them.
The atmosphere which the Cahill
Government expects to prevail can be
judged from its hasty passage of the
Defamation Bill, in which the really vital
clauses are those which alter the law of
slander in such a way as to get a grip
on the street loudspeaker and the broad-
casters.
It will have the advantage that the
Communist party will not hang round its
neck and cover it with kisses to the same
extent as it did to Evatt in the Federal
campaign, during which the Communist-
led unions shared their “Out Menzies”
fund between Labor and the Communist
party. But it has not succeeded in
warding-off the D.L.P., which is grimly
determined to contest every likely seat
in the interests of “clean politics.” And
whenever it looks for a date in the
calendar for 1959 on which it may expect
to enjoy a calm passage through the.
elections, it will find some embarrassing
event which will rattle every skeleton in
the A.L.P. cupboard, not to mention its
own.
If it goes early in the year it will clash
with the first days of the Federal session,
during which will be exhibited the
mangled remains of the once-great
Federal party marching towards the Light
on the Hill, but now hung-up dissected
into raw Red factions and pale gristly
factions.
The sensation of the week has been
the outburst of Mr. Eddie Ward against
his leader, whom he has hitherto made
a pious pretence of supporting, though
the support has been more like that which
his original sponsor in Federal politics,
J. S. Garden, used to advise his Com-
munist followers to accord to J. T. Lang:
“Support Lang as the rope supports
the hanged man.”
Mr. Ward has the air of a judge read-
ing a list of convictions prior to passing
sentence when he accuses Dr. Evatt of
having made grave mistakes in the cam-
paign, especially in advertising for
Catholic votes and cringing and crawling
to the D.L.P. Before his respected leader
indulged in those tactics, he said, every-
thing was going all right.
Since Campbell, president of the N. S.
Wales A.L.P., made it clear at the meeting
at which Eddie Ward spoke that Dr.
Evatt’s tactics constituted splendid leader-
ship, the situation seems to portend a
battle royal about February between the
State faction following Evatt and the
Ward party (or faction, or splinter, or
whatever it is). It can be taken for
granted that the Watersiders and such
unions are already on the Ward side,
otherwise he would scarcely have
sounded-off.
If Mr. Cahill goes to the country round
February or March he will probably have
to make his voice heard above either a
Donnybrook or the stertorous breathing
of sections which have been gagged to
the point of strangulation by their con-
trolling juntas to let him have a clean
run. The factions will find it difficult to
remain silent in a field in which the
D.L.P. and Charles Morgan, with his
Little Brother Labor party in the Banks-
town area, are on the rampage full of
knowledge about the internal workings
and scandals of the party.
If he goes towards the middle of the
year, which is about the latest he can
go, he will have to face the aftermath
of the A.L.P. Federal meetings in March
at which the decisions of the Hobart
Conference will no doubt be re-endorsed
and a inea culpa uttered for failure to
emphasise the socialisation pledge in the
Federal campaign.
The . Opposition leadership does not
inspire great confidence even among its
best friends. But with that admitted,
Mr. Cahill’s chances are poor—gerry-
mandered electorates and all —and his
party might easily come back looking
just as much a thing of shreds and
patches as the Federal section has
become.
Sydney City Council Politics
If N.S.W. Labor has any principles
in its approach to the civic governance
of Sydney it has been remarkably success-
ful in keeping them concealed. Five years
ago, when allegations of graft on the part
of some Sydney aldermen were flying
so thick and so fast that even some mem-
bers of the A.L.P. were asking for a
royal commission, the Cahill Government
took drastic action. To investigate the
allegations? No, to stop them! Or, at
any rate, to stop publication of them,
by means of its Press Gag Act.
At the same time the A.L.P. executive
encouraged belief that there might be
something in the allegations by cancelling
all Labor nominations for the impending
city-council election and- appointing a
new batch selected by itself. As a further
precaution against any of the rejects
being elected, the Cahill Government
abolished the long-established ward-
system and introduced proportional-
representation with the whole of the
Sydney municipality voting as one elec-
torate.
The hew system served its masters well.
Labor retained control of the council.
True, the system was responsible for
two Communists gaining seats on the
council, but that was only a minor em-
barrassment. Three years later, however,
the system also resulted in D.L.P. aider-
men being elected. This was a very
different matter, and one that had to be
rectified.
Elections are due again next year, and
the Labor controllers of the council are
preparing plans for a return to the ward-
system. Not the original wards ; a fairer
and more modern system. So far they
haven’t agreed on the details, but it’s a
barrow-licence to a bus-ticket that A.L.P.
representation won’t be weakened by the
change.
Municipal elections won’t be held until
next December, but the change is appa-
rently being given urgent attention. The
reason given for the hurry is that plenty
of time must be allowed for bringing the
municipal rolls up to date. Opposition
aldermen are suggesting that another
reason could be the imminence of a State
election, with the possibility that the
plan, if long delayed, might have to gain
the approval of a different Minister for
Local Government.
Two-house Sitting
Clearly the most sensible method of
eliminating, in future, any of the dead-
locks which have plagued Governments
of all parties in Victoria is for a sitting
of both the Assembly and Council when
an impasse has been reached, as it has,
currently, on the Bolte Government’s
hire-purchase and bread-reform bills.
Under the Constitutional Reform Act,
which governs relations between the two
Houses, the onus is cast on the Assembly
(or the Government commanding it) to
seek a dissolution when the Council re-
jects a measure held to be vital; if
re-elected, the Government may then,
within long time-limits, pass ’ the bill
through the Assembly, resubmit it to
the Council, and if it is again rejected,
seek a dissolution of the Council from
the Governor.
So many arbitrary months and weeks
are set between these moves that it would
take half of a Government’s three-year
term to get a measure past a hostile
Council.
Premier Bolte, who is a supporter of
the bicameral system, has announced
that the House which should go to the
people if it rejects a measure, such as
Supply, named by the Government of
the day as vital, is the Council not the
Assembly; but this, of course, would
give too much power to the Government.
Any measure might be claimed as vital
and the Council dissolved if it did not
accept it.
A joint sitting of both Houses on a
disputed measure, at least before either
or both were dissolved, would be a
democratic means of deciding the issue,
and in the present dispute would result
in a substantial win for the Govern-
ment which has a large majority in the
Assembly and is short of only one vote
in the Council.
Wounded cries have arisen more shrilly
from the Country party than the A.L.P.
at Bolte’s announced plan to “make the
Council more responsible to the will of
the people,” a fair enough comment from
a Premier recently elected with such a
commanding majority in the Assembly.
Sir Herbert Hyland says it is time the
Premier stopped squealing about the
Legislative Council, since the members
“were all democratically elected by the
people.” He has forgotten the description
of the Council by his former leader,


Artful Albert Dunstan, when Premier
“The Legislative Council in Victoria,’
said Sir Albert, “is an inverted Micawber,
waiting for something to turn down.”
Commonwealth Coinage
For just over a century the agitation
has been going on in Australia —of
and on —for the establishment of
decimal coinage. It has been going on in
other countries contemporaneously, the
United Kingdom included, but the vast
changes necessary in books and records
and the mechanical side of banking and
commercial organisations have always
caused Governments to pause.
The agitation has been carried on in
an un-co-ordinated way in single coun-
tries of the Commonwealth which, taken
as a whole, are a horrible financial
jumble mostly tied to sterling. The
British have their medieval system which
is good for the national dexterity in
arithmetic. The Canadians are on the
decimal system, linked easily to the
American dollar, of necessity. Australia
has the British system; so has New
Zealand, but with a different sterling
rate of exchange. Fiji has the coinage
of the United Kingdom with a still
different rate of exchange, despite the
fact that most of the banking is done
by Australian banks.
In the West Indies, in most places,
the local currency is British-based, but
U.S. dollars are so generally accepted
that there is almost a dual currency
system. It is all very mixed —in Trini-
dad, for instance, though British currency
is legal tender, the Government issues
dollar-notes. The main bank is the Royal
Bank of Canada, but most of the British
banks- have some branches.
India has for some time issued notes
above the rupee in denominations of 10,
but has not yet succeeded in final liquida-
tion of its extraordinarily complicated
small coinage in the pice-anna ranges.
In Ceylon, where the currency was de-
valued with sterling in 1949, there is a
decimal system. Hong Kong and Malaya
have a decimal system based on local
dollars, which are quite different animals
in value to the American types of dollar.
South Africa, by its Act of 1922, estab-
lished a uniform coinage for the Union
with denominations the same as those of
the United Kingdom. A Weights and
Measures Act passed the same year pro-
vided for the optional use of the decimal
system, but not in coinage.
The Minister for Finance has
announced that the South African Gov-
ernment will issue decimal coinage prob-
ably in 1961. The Australian Govern-
ment is veering towards a decimal system
and is examining the possibilities and
difficulties.
It seeips a pity that a uniform scheme
and range of coins cannot be organised
for the whole British Commonwealth.
The growing interchange of air-
passengers makes the need more impera-
tive every day. The Bulletin has heard
of one unfortunate who has faced no
less than 11 different currencies in a
voyage round the world taking 10 days.
Saturation in Subversion
The Communist position over the world
as a whole seems to have reached the
point at which public consciousness is
suffering satiety and can take in no
more. Reporting of disparate events is
ragged and un-co-ordinated. No attempt
is being made by the press to present as
a whole picture what is happening and
to distil the consolidated truth. The
cable-editors seem to have had enough
and to be retiring defeated before the
incessant onrush of petty Communist
advances and major Communist threats.
The Moscow system of uttering blaz-
ing menaces regarding some point at
which it is unlikely to act (since the
consequences would be too great), while
under cover of the noise and shouting
striking another blow at the West some-
where else far away, persists with normal
success.
It must be obvious that for the East
Germans to take-over East Berlin, as
Hungary was taken-over in the face of
public opinion by Soviet tanks, is not
feasible short of world war. Yet the
plan continues to hold the stage, though
every day events tell against the chances
of a change.
The Western Powers concerned have
made it clear that they have no inten-
tion of getting out. The cruel and wicked
trick of East Germany of seizing an
American airman and holding him so
that the United States might have to
recognise and parley with the East Ger-
man Government, which it has refused
to recognise as anything but a serf of
Moscow, has been without effect.
Dr. Adenauer has continued his advo-
cacy of a united Germany created by a
free vote which the “democrats” of
Moscow have no intention whatever of
allowing. Their plan is to finally lower
the Iron Curtain east of the Elbe to
bring Russia’s attack-frontier within 500
miles of London and 400 miles of Paris.
No country, and particularly not France
or West Germany, can permit the
Russians to get away with the plan.
Dr. Adenauer has been adamant about
the terms on which he will agree to an
arrangement to reunite Germany. He
will have no peace-treaty with Russia
except one negotiated by a freely and
democratically elected all-German Gov-
ernment. He will have no agreement
based on withdrawal from Nato or an
all-European security system including
the Russian countries. He will have no
German confederation and will not
recognise East Germany. And he calls
for the return to Germany of the Oder-
Neisse lands on the Polish side, which
have been seized and incorporated in
Poland.
In a week when 6750 refugees escaped
across the border to join the 3,000,000-
odd who had previously run away from
the East German ' prison-house, the
Berlin City Parliament elections were
held in the Western sectors of the city
with all the normal accompaniments of
elections in democratic countries —
posters and shouting and the noisy
arguments of contending parties, includ-
ing the Communists, who might almos
not have been there at all.
With the dreary spectacle of Com
munist Government open for all voter
to see on the other side of the Branden
burg Gate, the West Berlin Communist
could not muster up enough votin
support for the idea of Khrushchev’
“free-city” plan to elect even one candi
date. Alongside their vote of 2.7 pe
cent, in 1954 they polled only 1.9 pe
cent., while the Social Democrats o:
Burgomaster Brandt, the fearless leade
of anti-Soviet thought, carried 78 seat
and the Christian Democrats 55, the 1
Free Democrats and the eight in th
Free People’s party, who were elected
1954, having been wiped out.
While the noise has drawn all eye
and ears to Berlin, however, the Sovie
Union has been busily concentrating on
other places—in developing its footholc
in Egypt with the help of Nasser; in
warning the Persians that the conclu
sion of any mutual defence arrangemen
with the United States would constitute
an immediate danger”; and in arming the
Iraqis.
Meanwhile the genuineness of the
Arab intentions as expressed at their
Sunday-school meeting during the U.N
Assembly, is becoming very much blown
upon in the light of the new provoca-
tive attacks by Syria on Israel.
In terms of practical politics there may
be more brewing in Asia than in the
Berlin zone.
Outpost Outlook
[From “Ex-ACT”]
Westralians have no doubt that the
recent visits to the North-west by the
Prime Minister and other Ministers, plus
the recommendation of the Liberal
Federal Council that, “as a matter of
high national importance,” the develop-
ment of the north of Australia should
receive the immediate attention of the
Federal Government, will yield some
fruit. Moves were begun in Perth
some time ago to have the problems of
developing the North examined in Can-
berra in conjunction with the Westralian
and Queensland Governments and the
Northern Territory administration, so
that, if common problems were “estab-
lished and agreed on,” there should be a
long-term appointment of a Northern
Australian Development Commission.
Public works, tax-incentives and mining
policies have all been discussed. Liberals
in W.A. have claimed that the recent
Federal grant of £2,500,000 was merely
“playing with the problem,” and that if
£3OO million can be spent on the Snowy
Mountains scheme, then £2O million could
be spent on the Ord River development
proposal, which would return “a dividend
100 to 200 per cent, more.”
There have been many promises about
the North in the last half-century, but
the necessity for development there has
never been so dramatically or urgently
apparent.

of diminishing bottles and several plates

awful certainty that she was going to sing,
and Guess Who was going to accompany

draining my glass I edged out to the front.
She said, “And how’s your sight-

of sheet-music, thrust “Don’t Be Cross,
Dear” at me —“Do you think you could
manage this?” Dazzled and infuriated
by her smile, I walked to the piano, and
she took-up her singing-position smack

STERN MEASURES
“Forecasting ‘stern measures’ to reduce the

The tyres and .driver shriek and curse;
One more pedestrian cops a ride,
First in an ambulance, then a hearse —
And room for plenty more inside;
And if, a sop to foolish pride,
They want their killers brought to book
They may at last be satisfied:
The sternest measures will be took.
The situation could be worse,
The motor-funeral be denied,
Insurance might not reimburse
The damages the laws provide.
To ask for more might seem like hide ;
It savors less of jiggerypook
If left to others to decide
The sternest measures will be took.
Why be ungrateful? Why reverse
The rising accidental tide
Which may be trusted to immerse
All people that on earth abide ?
For those not knocked-down will

And who will need the grave rebuke
Of radio-records, left to chide
“The sternest measures will be took”?

arrived in the vestry just in time to con-

to be short and sweet, since the congre-

“Oliver Twist”: Comments (B.
32/11/ ’5B) on changing conditions since
1914 remind me of my years as a
hobbledehoy in Brisbane about that
time. I was employed as a lad at a large
boot-and-shoe warehouse still in Queen
Street. Often all hands were required
to work back at night from about 6 p.m.
to 10.30 p.m., sometimes to recondi-
tion footwear imported from overseas
packed moist, which had grown a lovely
pale-green crop of mildew on the way
here. Our job was to brush-off the
mildew, which, as the evening progressed,
filled the air with a pale-green fog in
which we brushed, sneezed and coughed
for three or four hours. Payment for
such overtime was unheard-of in those
days ; but each of us received 18d. as
tea-money and was told to be back on
time. Hungry as hunters, most of us
had our tea at Puff’s in Queen Street
(just above His Majesty’s Theatre), where
Herr Puff served, for 6d., soup, meat dish,
sweets and cup of tea. Both- floors were
usually packed to the doors, and we boys
really relished those meals, happy to be
showing a profit of Is. on the night’s
work ahead. The corner on which now
stands Brisbane’s £l-million Town Hall
was in those days occupied by a boot-
factory built below the level of the street
and with a low roof that overhung the
footpath. Opposite, on the corner of
Albert and Adelaide Streets, were
Walker’s horse-saleyards (again below
street-level), where we boys often perched
on the high fails and watched the
horses below —truly a contrast to the
scene at that spot today.

rowed ashore from the Royal yacht (first
English King since William II to land
from a pulling-boat on his own open
coast). His first night in camp he had
us all up in turn and asked if we had
any boy in our sections who needed
“the Royal touch.” I had one—a little
rebel from an industrial town who had
plainly told me that he wasn’t interested
in the whole show, and “couldn’t stomach
toft's.” As I mentioned this, I noted a
twinkle in his Majesty’s eye. Next day
I presented my candidate, bowed, and


left King and rebel together. King
George put his hand on the lad’s shoulder
and led him away some paces, talking
quietly, and the boy answering. I don’t
know what was said, but from then on
the boy, who had previously shown no
interest in games and competitions', be-
came a veritable tiger. In the final,
sternest test, the cross-country race, this
youngster, who had never before run
cross-country, collapsed, run-out on the
finishing-line, last in my section, but
44th out of 400 boys. As I picked him
up, he muttered: “Tell the King I did
it”—and I did so, with my humble duty.
“He says hell Wait till you return."

little to earn and many to
keep”? There was no basic-
wage or child - endowment in
those days. When the singer
came to “Three corpses lay out
on the shining sands,” all the
guests must have been weeping
copiously. And then there was
that cheerful little ditty about
the passenger in the train whose
dead baby was “In the luggage-

as indicating that the inebriated
gentlemen were merely exercis-

amongst them causing 131 casualties —39
killed.
For those who have never met a
“rubber-heeled” shell, it was one which
sneaked-up on you because its velocity
was greater than the speed of sound —as
the Battalion Scientist used to explain to
newcomers: “First you get killed, then
you hear the shell coming, then the gun
goes off ”
TEST
Grim-visaged are those batsmen at the
crease
Who now have notched eleven runs
apiece ;
Clinging on there, a pair of flannelled
linnets,
Their score has taken just 200 minutes.
A slow full-toss outside the leg-stump
floats;
The batsman’s not one of those reckless
goats
Whod risk pulling it toward the distant
pickets —
He taps it just nine feet, between the
wickets.
Then, fearing lie's been too daring doing
that.
He meets the next five balls with broad,
dead bat.
For him the flashing blade, the dancing
feet,
Are sewn-up firmly in their winding-sheet.
So one, and then the other, seeks surcease
From life’s excitement at the popping-
crease.
Smother-up, push and poke, dawdle and
block,
No challenge is presented by the clock.
Some 20 minutes pass before a run
Is notched —a gentle tap wide of mid-on ;
Then back he crawls, deep back, into his
shell —
Attack's no way to defend a citadel!
Their duty’s just to stay there; they
discharge it;
They mustn’t hit the ball, only massage it.
Displaying the energy of two sick prawns,
The pair put up a record score of yawns.
As drags its slow length the funereal play,
The gloom - drenched patrons ponder
whether to stay.
Then, towards the day’s end, some strange
madness seizing
One batsman to indulge in brief crowd-
pi easing
{Though sceptical may be the stand and
hill.
It’s pathologically possible)
Caps a full over of consistent flailing
By sending open-shouldered sixer sailing.
Alas! For that belated burst of glory,
Which might have been enshrined in well-
told story
Or made the basis of an epic pome,
Is wasted, for the mob have all gone
home

RUSSIA BUILDS ON STEEL
Early this year the Gov-
ernments of the United
States and Russia man-
aged to agree on a plan
for exchange visits between
representative groups of the
two nations. The first Ameri-
can industrial delegation to
Russia under the agreement
was made-up of a bunch of
steel-industry bigshots who
were in Russia from May 21
to June 21, 1958.
The leader of the delegation
was Edward L. Ryerson, direc-
tor and former board chairman
of the Inland Steel Company,
Chicago, which ranks near the
top of U.S. steel concerns with
sales last year of $763,950,000.
When Ryerson was lately in
Australia a Bulletin man
managed to pin him down long
enough for a very revealing
yarn on the steel-industry, to
which Russia nails all hopes of
matching industrial production
of the Western world.
Ryerson and his colleagues
were given the full v.-i.-p.
treatment. In Moscow, serving
as headquarters for their jaunts
to steel-plants all over the
Union, they were put-up at the
new 30-story Hotel Ukraine,
which most Muscovites only
ever see from the outside.
Most of their 8000 miles
junketing was covered in one
of the new commercial TU-104
twin - jet passenger - planes
staffed by stewards in the best
capitalist tradition, passing
round newspapers, flight-maps,
trays of sweets, meals, and
even such conveniences as
cellophane-bags for the pas-
sengers’ fountain-pens’, which
sometimes leak at high alti-
tudes. Carrying 75 passengers
and cruising round 600 m.p.h.
at 33,000 ft., these jet-airliners
can put behind a 1000-mile
trip in well under two hours.
Despite a crammed travel-
schedule and such traps as
almost daily receptions at
which they were expected to
find stowage for Russian deli-
cacies in the line of raw and
pickled fish, jellied crabs,
caviar and smoked sturgeon,
well washed down with vodka,
brandy and wine—the dele-
gates managed to get the best
look-see anyone from the West
has yet had at Russia’s major
basic industry and, through it,
the Russian worker.
Steel, they confirmed, is very
much the Soviet’s kingpin
industry. It took a bad ham-
mering during the war, but has
trebled its output in the last
10 years and now has about 40
per cent, of the capacity of the
American steel-industry.
A powerful propaganda-
campaign is aimed at convinc-
ing steelworkers that their con-
tributions to production are all-
important to the future of
Communism. Steel-plants are
decorated with huge colored
posters pushing such slogans as
“Victory Of Communism
Depends On Increased Produc-
tivity.” On “honor-rolls” at
steel-plants and in prominent
places round Soviet cities are
displayed large photographs of
industrial heroes workers
who have exceeded their
quotas, suggested new ideas, or
generally contributed outstand-
ingly to increased production.
The Soviet press naturally
adds its weight to this cam-
paign, constantly stressing the
vital role of steel in the Com-
munist economy and tearing
verbal strips off organisations
and managers when they fail
to meet their production- or
expansion-programmes.
TMTanagement of industry in
Russia recently has been
streamlined somewhat by a
programme of decentralisation
introduced by Khrushchev.
Until about 18 months ago,
industry was controlled overall
by the GOSPLAN, or Federal
Planning Commission, which
laid down the production-goals
aimed at under the various
five-year plans. After that,
matters were in the hands of
individual Ministries, which
from a central office in Moscow
controlled each industry
throughout Russia and satellite
countries.
Khrushchev’s decentralisa-
tion system was introduced in
March, 1957. GOSPLAN is
still at the top, laying-down
production-goals in cahoots
with the Committee for Science
and Technology. But super-
vision of the programme —■
control of production itself —
now rests with Regional
Economic Councils (Sovnar-
khoz) replacing the old cen-
tralised Ministries.
A network of 103 of these
regional councils covers the
entire Soviet Union, each con-
trolling all industry within its
allotted area. Now, instead of
having to refer every fiddling
little matter to Moscow for
decision, decisions are made on
the local level within a few
hundred miles of the plant
concerned. According to
figures supplied to the Ameri-
can delegation, this has
increased production appre-
ciably.
Trade-unions play a big role
in Russian industry, though of
course it is a role that would
horrify unions on the other
side of the Iron Curtain.
Only about four or five per
cent, of the Russian citizenry
are actually members of the
Communist party. In fact, for
the average man in the street,
it is veiy hard to become a
member and entails at least a
year of waiting while his back-
giound is investigated with
a fine-tooth comb. But vir-
tually all workers belong to
unions although union mem-
beiship is theoretically not
compulsory. And through
Communist - party members
strategically located in key-
positions in the unions (as they
are in every other organisation
affecting life in -.Russia) the
social and economic objectives
of the unions become merely
those of the Communist party.
There are 22 industrial
labor-unions in the U.S.S.R. —
one for each major industry,
while lesser industries are
grouped into loose connection
under single unions. The
American delegation found
that in the case of the steel-
workers’ union - membership
ran the whole gamut from raw
recruit to top-management,
including the plant-director,
Just how the Big Boss operates
as a member of the union is
something Western trade-union
members might ponder,
The delegation was told
quite frankly that the greater
part of the '
union’s time was
spent in what is its most
important function—develop-
j n g anc j promoting plans for
increasing steel - production,
Qne way in which the unions
are ab le to act j n this direction
stems from the fact that in
Communist Russia private
ownership is limited to a small
range of “personal” propertv,
held for personal consumption
or enjoyment. The ordinary
citizen can only own such
things as furniture, household
appliances, clothing or, if he
belongs to the top elite, pos-
sjbly a car or even a house
( with the State retaining title
land),

POLITICAL POINTS
Rejecting Opposition attempts to have
the Defamation Bill held over until
Parliament resumes on February 24, the
Cahills forced it through the final stages
by 40 votes to 32, the Independent
members Purdue and Clive Evatt voting
with the Opposition. Then, after the
customary splather of non-defamatory
seasonal greetings, the N. S. Wales
Assembly adjourned for the Christmas
recess.
• •
On Friday night the N.S.W. State
executive of the A.L.P. passed a resolu-
tion deploring criticism of Dr. Evatt’s
leadership in the election campaign.
Among other things it said:
This executive resents the unwarranted
attacks which have been directed at Dr.
Evatt and asserts without equivocation our
admiration for his splendid leadership and
presentation of Labor’s policy.
Before the motion was presented E. J.
Ward criticised the Doc.’s action in
offering to resign the A.L.P. leadership
in return for D.L.P. preferences. He
also criticised Labor advertisements seek-
ing D.L.P. prefs.; he described this action
as “cringing and crawling.”
Eddie wanted the motion held over
for redrafting, but the meeting over-
ruled him.
Ward’s action has started rumors that
he intends to make a bid for the leader-
ship when caucus holds its pre-session
meeting in February. There’s no doubt
he’d like the job and will make a bid
for it if and when he feels he has the
numbers. But it’s doubtful whether he
thinks the time is ripe yet.

£1 million, and there are already 40 on
order —20 for British Empire Airways
and 20 for Trans-Canada Airlines. It is

The D.L.P. has decided to contest at
least 25 of the 94 Assembly seats at next
year’s N.S.W. general election. Of these
13 are held by the A.L.P. and 12 by
Liberal' and Country - party candidates.
Labor-held seats are Blacktown, Bondi,
Concord, Dulwich Hill, Dubbo, Goul-
burn, Hamilton, Hartley, Mudgee, North
Sydney, Rockdale, Ryde and Young.
Those held by the Opposition are Armi-
dale, Burwood, Coogee, Drummoyne,
Earlwood, George’s River, Hornsby,
Maitland, Nepean, Parramatta, Suther-
land and Wagga.
Most of these seats are possible
swingers ; many are held by very slender
majorities.
No decision on preferences will be
announced until the new year.

Is the gilt coming off Queensland’s
Gold Coast? On Thursday 26 blocks at
Broadbeach were put-up to public auction
at the Brisbane Land Office. Conditions
of sale were freehold-title without any

blocks were sold. Later in the day five
more blocks were sold, but no fancy

The reconstructed Federal Ministry
has only six of the Ministers who
formed the first Liberal-Country-party
Ministry after the defeat of the Chifley
Government in 1949. These are Prime
Minister Menzies and the Minister for
Repatriation, Senator Cooper, both of
whom still hold their original port-
folios ; Minister for Trade John McEwen
(originally Minister for Commerce and
Agriculture); Treasurer Harold Holt
(Labor and National Service and Immi-
gration) ; External Affairs Minister
Casey (Supply and Development, Works
and Housing); Vice-President of the
Executive Council and Minister for
National Development Senator Spooner
(Social Services).
Three of the original 19 have died,
three have retired and five hold diplo-
matic or judicial appointments. Besides
the six Ministers only two —Sir Earle
Page and Senator O’Sullivan —are still
in Parliament.

Queensland Central Executive of the
A.L.P. has also recorded its approval of
Evatt’s campaign tactics, congratulating
him on his “courageous and exemplary
leadership throughout the recent arduous

The resolution voicing these sentiments
concluded, “So long as Dr. Evatt remains
Federal leader we assure him of the
warmest support from the Queensland
branch.”
THE PART THAT BUMPS


By fixing February 24 as the date for
reopening his talking-shop Cahill seems
to indicate that he won’t fix polling-day
for the State election earlier than the
end of April or the beginning of May.
Easter falls in the last week of March,
and politicians don’t like a holiday break
in the middle of their election-campaign.
Still, in Joe’s case it mightn’t be a bad
idea. It would give him a chance to
think-up a second batch of promises if
the first batch didn’t seem to be going
too well.

Using two cliches to make a mixed
metaphor, J. M. Tripovich, secretary of
Vic. A.L.P., said that Custom Credit’s
reduction of h.-p. interest-rates from 10
per cent, to 8 per cent, was “a step in
the right direction, but only a drop in
the ocean.”' Four more steps of similar
dimensions and there’d be no interest-
charge at all. Or, if Tripo. prefers it,
five such drops out of the ocean and
there’d be no ocean left.
• •
N.S.W. Labor has never dropped its
scheme of a Greater Sydney, with one-
big-city-council to control the whole area.
In 1947 strong opposition saved several
municipalities from absorption, but from
time to time they are reminded that they
were not pardoned, but merely reprieved.
The subject came up again last week
when Labor Alderman D. Ellis, of Rand-
wick Council, suggested that Rand wick,
Botany and Waverley municipalities
should amalgamate with Sydney City
Council. This was Lord Mayor Jensen’s
cue to say that “in the interests of these
and other areas not far from the city,
the Government should extend the City
Council’s area.” He visualised the city’s
boundaries reaching out to the seacoast
and down to Botany Bay.
That’s the same old Greater Sydney
plan. If the municipalities involved don’t
want to lose their identity they’ll start
fighting it right away. In particular they
should insist that no changes should be
made without consulting the people of
the areas concerned.

Bad weather sometimes plays havoc
with British and European air-schedules
by compelling the closing of airports.
It is predicted that the “next generation”
of British Empire Airways planes will be
equipped to land automatically. First
to have this complicated gadget built-in
will be the three - jet HDI2I, a plane
that will carry between 80 and 100
passengers at 600 m.p.h. Twenty-four
of these craft have been ordered by
8.E.A., delivery beginning in 1964.

Australian telephone - subscribers have
been known to complain about bills or
service—but they’ve never had the kind
of grouch some Colombo phone-users
revealed recently. Several subscribers
were called on to pay for repairs when
their phones were damaged by thugs in
communal riots. The thugs had entered
homes to destroy and loot. They were
not restrained by the police, but this
didn’t restrain the Government from
demanding payment for the damage. The
argument is still unsettled.

It’s on again: Victorian Cabinet will
soon appoint “an independent commit-
tee of inquiry to examine the salaries of
Members of Parliament,” otherwise, a
nice, kind, understanding fellow who will
recommend more pay for Parliamen-
tarians. Still, it is more than four years
since they got their last lift —to £2OOO
and £lOO-£4OO “electoral expenses” a
year. Electoral expenses are the political
equivalent of the businessman’s tax-free
expense-account.

Tasmania is at last undertaking an
overdue political reform which will wipe-
out the frustrations and deadlocks caused
by an equal number of members on
each side of the House of Assembly.
Each of the five electoral divisions (on
the Federal boundaries) is now to have
seven members instead of six; there
will thus be 35 members in the House
instead of 30. As the Hobart “Mercury”
pointed out, the Hare-Clark system will
no longer be asked to do the impossible
feat of finding a majority in a small even
number. It is admitted, of course, that
the new method could give an Indepen-
dent the balance of power.

“Collins Street”: In Melbourne there’s
one law for the motorist and another
for tram - drivers. One trammie, who
admitted having 20 to 25 pots in about
three hours, drove against a policeman’s
signal at a peak-hour, collapsed on the
floor of his compartment when inter-
cepted and fell over each time he was
asked to perform a simple task, was
fined £4. The maximum fine for
drunkenness in charge of a carriage (i.e.,
all vehicles other than cars) is £5 ; but
Parliament is apparently too tired to
alter the law, though an amending bill
could be passed through both Houses in
less time than it takes a driver to get
drunk.

Sweden, which sits a little uneasily on
the edge of the Iron Curtain and has
no military alliances, has been buying
Australian Jindiviks (unmanned target-
aircraft) to train its A.-A. gunners and
other defence forces. The Swedish
Minister to Australia, Carl Bergen-
strahle, says these protect a vast atomic-
energy programme, on which it may be
possible to exchange Australian and
Swedish students.

Melbourne “Herald’s” heading “Equal
pay on last lap,” over an item reporting
that the N.S.W. equal-pay-for-women
bill had reached the Legislative Council,
wasn’t quite right. The problem has
really been thrown into the laps of the
industrial judges, who will have to decide
which women will be entitled to equal-
pay.
Tipsters are busy trying to pick the
date of the next U.K. general election.
Prime Minister Macmillan told Nye
Bevan in the Commons last week that
“the inquest of the nation may be sooner
than you think.” From this the “Daily
Herald” has deduced that the poll will
be held in the spring—probably in
February. The last election, held in May,
1955, gave the Conservatives 345 seats,
Labor 277, Liberals six and others two.
This was the first election for 90 years
at which a Government had increased
its majority.
At by-elections since 1955 the Govern-
ment has lost a couple of seats, and the
Conservative vote has been generally
lower than at the general election. Re-
cently, however, the tide which had been
running against the Government seems
to' have turned again, largely owing to
the personal popularity of Macmillan.
This may influence Cabinet to plump for
an early election, instead of letting the
Parliament run on for its full five-year
term.

Bolte’s safety-in-industry researchers
have come up with more startling figures:
Accidents cost the State about 500
workers’ lives and £l6O million a year ;
about 2600 persons are permanently dis-
abled and 260,000 temporarily disabled.
The cost is about £84,000 an hour, and
Bolte has called an industrial safety
conference at Melbourne University. He
reminded it before it began that the
solution must be that employers provide
safety-devices and employees use them
fully.

“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: Australian wool-
growers aren’t the only ones to suffer
from falling world prices. Lower prices
for copra, rubber and pearlshell, as well
as a fall in gold-output caused
exports from Papua-New Guinea to
drop last year by £675,000 to about
<£.12,404,000. At the same time imports
rose by £.658,000 to more than
£20,238,000. The Territories’ trade
has fallen only onee previously, in
1952-3, and the important over-all pic-
ture is that the total value of trade has
risen pretty steadily from a mere
£11,019,000 in 1948-9 to the present
total of nearly £33 million. Develop-
ment may not be spectacular, but it’s by
no means unimpressive.

Traffic holdups at Gladesville Bridge
over the Parramatta River have prompted
inquiries as to when the new high-level
bridge is to be built. It was promised
years ago and tenders closed in October,
1957, but no decision has yet been
announced. Main Roads Board secretary
R. S. Johnston says that when the job
begins it will take about three years.
It’s to be hoped that estimate is nearer
to the mark than some earlier ones have
been. Iron Cove Bridge and Spit Bridge
were both to have been three-year jobs.
The first, due for completion in 1949,
wasn’t opened for traffic until 1955 ; the
second, scheduled for 1954, was used
for the first time last month.

Rickenbacker in France with the U.S.
Army Air Corps, then joined the Lock-
heed people in 1929, and has been with
them ever since. In the U.S. slump of
1930-31 it was Squier and a small group
headed by Robert E. Gross, brother of
Courtlandt S. Gross (B. 22/10/’5B), who
held the corporation together and ulti-
mately re-established it. In 1933 he sold
Sir Charles Kingsford Smith the Lock-
heed Altair, Lady Southern Cross, which
was the only single-engined aircraft ever
to make the west-east crossing of the
Pacific. “Smithy” was flying this plane

fought as a private on Gallipoli and was
subsequently commissioned. With the Ist

Pastoralist, former president of the
Graziers’ Federal Council of Australia,
leader of the Australian delegation to

himself been called “a new Erasmus”—
he certainly is in the right vein when
he quotes his aim as being to make the
A.B.C, the Hyde Park of the air.

In 1937 Eric Burnett Moses landed the
job of first permanent concert-manager
in N.S.W. for the A.8.C., with the
stipulation that he would have to change
his name. With another Moses—Charles
—already in the g.-m.-ship, the then
administrator foresaw a heap of con-
fusion ; so E.B.M. obligingly amputated
his end-name and became Eric Burnett.
111-health now looks like causing his
retirement, but, when he does retire, the
baptismal name he can then resume will
sound strange in his ears.
As front-of-the-house man on tour
with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra,
Burnett (or should it be Moses?) claims
to have had more farewells than Melba.
Year after year he’d announce to the
orchestra that the burden of travel in
his declining health would force him


to forego the tour, and each year would
see him back again with them.
Moses (or should it be Burnett?) has
been a natural for the job—he knew the
concert game inside-out both from
Nicholson’s box-office and from his own
considerable experience as a concert-
manager. He contends vigorously that
present musical awareness and the popu-
larity of the commission’s subscription-
concerts owe less to the influx of musical-
minded Europeans than to the steady
home-developed growth of culture fer-
tilised by the A.B.C.’s free school-
concerts and the youth-concerts, which
build the audiences of tomorrow. He
should know, because he’s in a unique
position to observe. John Moses, music-
and film-critic, is Eric’s son.

Diggers of War I nicknamed him
“Blue,” but “Freeman’s Journal” in 1917
reported him as “an old white-bearded
padre of a N.S.W. battalion, famous for
haunting the front trenches, despite con-
trary orders.” “Freeman’s” added that
he once “took prisoner and brought back
six giant Prussian guardsmen, amidst the
cheering of the Australians.” (This
exploit he denies.) Many know him as
Father Francis Clune, but may forget his
honors—Congregation of the Passion,
Cross of Leo, Military Cross.
Born in Ruan, in County Clare, in
1869, he went first to Chicago, but the
lure of Australia brought him in 1892 to
Sydney, where he joined the Passionist
Fathers. He celebrates the diamond
jubilee of his ordination this week, hav-
ing been ordained at Goulburn (N.S.W.)
on December 20, 1898. His services in
War I became a legend ; he won his M.C.
for bringing in wounded under fire at
Flers in 1916, and lost the sight of one
eye later. But his services to mankind,
from the working-boys of Adelaide to the
prisoners in Long Bay Penitentiary, where
he preaches retreats, have possibly made
him even better known —most certainly
to the many he has helped. (This sketch
of him was done by one of the prisoners
in Long Bay.)
DIAMOND JUBILEE
R.C. Bishop of the Kimberleys since
1935, Otto Raible has decided to return
to his native Germany. He’s 71, and for
30 years has been one of Westralia’s
best-known and best-liked churchmen.
Born in Stuttgart and ordained a Pallo-

slovakia to direct a youth movement in
1922, and arrived in Broome in 1927.
He was consecrated bishop in 1935.
Since then he has travelled over every
main road, bush-track and bridle-path
of the 120,000 square - miles of his
diocese, often walking as far as 24 miles
in a day. He served as a chaplain in
the Kaiser’s Army during War I, and
between the wars was often a welcome

“A.H.C.”: Sir Hubert Wilkins was
prepared to try anything once, though
he had a special taste for cold spots —
taking both Arctic and Antarctic, so to
speak, in his stride. In 1924 he varied
matters by returning to Australia on an
expedition to collect fauna for the British
Museum. He seems to have embarked on this
enterprise as a pot-boiler, because he had
little idea of what he wanted to obtain, as I
learned when discussing with him the terms
of his Queensland collecting-permit. He didn’t
know much about the ways of certain wild
Australians, either. A few months later he
walked too close to a wounded wedgetailed-
eagle and promptly had his pants ripped and
his stern lacerated by the huge bird’s talons.
Wilkins grinned through his beard as he related
this experience on returning south. Like his
fellow-adventurer, Vilhjalmur Stefansson (who
was also in Australia that year getting to know
the platypus), he always believed in gaining
knowledge the hard way.

ABORIGINALITIES
NED KELLY'S GIRL-FRIEND
"PRUITIEST socio-historical discovery of
the year—Ned Kelly had a relative
named Claus!
This stirring revelation is made by the
Maryborough (Vic.) “Advertiser,” which
ro ! Tl As issue of December 10,
1880, a tale told by a Mrs. Claus, who
cla.rned to be (a) Neds first-cousin and
(» his one-time sweetheart.
Madam Claus, it appears, resided at a
Maryborough mining outpost bearing the
salubrious name of Mosquito. None of
the Mosquitoites was aware of her
celebrity-link (says the recorder of the
period) until Ned was “allowed to drop
out of existence”—“allowed,” if you
please!—and then the secret emerged
only because “her womanly nature floated
to the surface and she gave vent to her
long-pent-up feelings in a flood of tears.”
The flood being dammed eventually,
Madam Claus related that when she was
a girl, living near the Strathbogie Ranges,
her parents and the senior Kellys were
estranged over religious differences.
However, she and Ned—“a splendid,
manly-looking fellow”—got along very
well indeed, so that he not only visited
her home frequently but became her
“first sweetheart.”
No data is added to explain why the
tale-teller—maiden name not given, by
the way—became Mrs. Claus instead of
Mrs. Kelly. Nor is it clear why she
abandoned picturesque Strathbogie for
drab little Mosquito.
Instead, she goes on to record that
“about 12 months ago” (presumably
meaning late in 1879) Ned actually paid
her a social call at Mosquito, and that
he was accompanied to the outskirts of
Maryborough by his brother Dan, Steve
Hart and Joe Byrne.
\l7hat is to be said of this yarn?
In fact, very little is known of the
movements of the Kelly gang in the
16 months between February, 1879
(when they raided Jerilderie), and June,
1880 (when they reached an end at
Glenrowan); but, personally, 1 find diffi-
culty in believing that during that “rest-
ful” period Ned took the special risks
indicated —a ride of a couple of hundred
miles through unfamiliar and largely
settled country —merely to greet a former
girl-friend who was now the mother of
five youngsters.
My scepticism is strengthened, too, by
the lack of any statement as to what Ned
said or did at Mosquito—how, for
example, he comported himself with the
paternal Claus and all the minor Clauses
—and also by the lack of any comment
on his appearance, his recent exploits, or
his hopes and fears.
On the other hand, Madam gives
details regarding Ned's alleged move-
“Did YOU knit Fluff, Cranny ?”
ments in Maryborough (naming a store
where he allegedly bought a suit, and a
pub where he shouted himself a beer),
and she adds a terse comment on Steve
Hart, with whom she says she went to
school, for not having had pluck enough
to visit her.
It does not appear that the “Adver-
tiser” (which possibly was reluctant to
risk robbing its town of bushranging
distinction) made any attempt to check
the Claus tale, either in Maryborough
or Mosquito. Indeed, the editor of the
day not only accepted the yarn at its face
value, and not only tossed in that choice
bit about “womanly nature floating to
the surface,” but added a double-barrelled
endorsement of the tale-teller’s veracity.
“Mrs. Claus’s story,” the paper
declared, “is to be credited, and we see
no reason to doubt it.”
Let’s hope that such editorial trust-
fulness was justified, and had no connec-
tion with the then near approach of
Santa. For, to be sure, the linking of
Ned Kelly with a woman named Claus
is even more stimulating than the claim
that his grandmother was a relative of
Buffalo Bill.

was going on, and on ; fan whirring,
clock tick-tocking, learned counsel per-
spiring (eight of them, including four
Q.C.s, packed wig-to-wig at a table),
reporters doodling, one sleeping. All the
headline stuff had been said for that
day. A. B. Kerrigan, Q.C., senior coun-
sel for the N.S.W. and Queensland Wool-
buyers’ Association, cross-examining H.
Bladwell, Farmers and Graziers’ g.-m.,
asked a question about “floor-shows.”
A stir at the press-table, a larger stir
behind it, among the barristers. Witness
looked puzzled. Counsel repeated the
question, with rather more emphasis:
“What space, at No. 2 store, was allocated
for floor-shows?” Someone chuckled.
A senior member of the Bar wondered,
silkily, whether his learned friend meant,
perhaps, show-floors? Learned friend
did. “Floor-shows!” someone at the Bar
table said, musingly. “Apparently,” Mr.




Justice Cook commented, “the wool busi-
ness isn’t as dull as it appears.” Mr.
Kerrigan, unperturbed, reframed the
question. The fan whirred. The reporter’s
head dropped back on his arms.

“Uramao”: A moon-fish, the second
to be found in New Zealand —the first
was 76 years ago at the mouth of the
Manawatu River —was washed-up re-
cently at Cape Runaway and sent by the
finder to the Auckland War Memorial
“Have you noticed that George seems to be drinking rather heavily lately ?”
Museum. Also known as the “Opah,”
it is pink and silver, with scarlet fins and
jaws. The present specimen was 31 in.
long, 13in. wide and 7in. thick.
* * * *
“Cisticola”: At the risk of again being
dubbed “somewhat pedantic,” I would
gently mention to “Deirdre” (B. 3/12/’5B)
that neither Leptospermum nor Mela-
leuca is “a botanical species,” but each
is a generic term (for a group of tea-
trees). My critic is wrong, too, in saying
that the common names of plants “can
never be proved correct or incorrect,” for,
in fact, botanists and foresters have hosts
of standardised terms. As to the wattle-
bird, although distinctly robust in voice,
it’s really no more “attractive” (in
appearance and behavior) than is the
average “attractive blonde” of Sydney
newspapers. Incidentally, here are a few
more corrections to the lamentable glos-
sary of The Penguin Book of Australian
Verse : Joseph Furphy (Tom Collins) died
in 1912, not 1913. Govett (of the Leap)
was William, not Thomas. Innamincka
is in S.A., not N.T. And—most important
of all! —Carbine was not “a champion
racehorse of the ’nineties”; he was foaled
in 1885 and retired to the stud in 1891.
* * * *
“Kinta”: One of the last slab home-
steads in Canberra has been removed to
make way for the development of the
city’s northernmost suburb of Lyneham.
First settled by Peter Shumack about 100
years ago, the original slab house was
revealed intact when the homestead
buildings were being demolished. It had
been protected and built-over when F. S.
Southwell took-over the property in 1910.
The original house, built entirely of red-
gum slabs, was about 30ft. by 10ft., and
had two rooms. Some of the slabs
measured 20in. wide. Complete with
shingle roof, the building has been
erected by Craig Smith, proprietor of the
local tourist-camp. The Canberra His-
torical Society hopes this valuable relic
of a habitation used by the pioneers will
ultimately be re-ected on a suitable site
and used as a folk-museum.
.** * *
“Bass”: The problem of how to
classify the product of two half-caste
parents (B. 26/11/’5B) doesn’t exist for
Commonwealth Social Service officials.
They’ve got a formula, and it works this
way. A girl’s father was 5/16th native;
her mother was 12/16th. Together they
total 34/32nds, so the girl, according to
the formula, is 17/32nds native. Don’t
think the formula would stand-up to any
scientific scrutiny, but it saves the Com-
monwealth a few bob —the girl in ques-
tion, living in a Perth suburb, has l/32nd
too much native in her to qualify for the
maternity-bonus.
* * * *
“Spin”: I’ve never thought much of
the Indian and Senegal turtle-doves as
nest-builders —their jobs look like a
bundle of twigs just dropped together
anyhow and holding more- by the grace
of God than by any effort oh the bird’s
part. Bui one that I watched collecting
material showed more than a trace of
selectiveness. She picked up a dozen
twigs and discarded them before she got
one that passed her test. Maybe her art
lies in building a nest that doesn’t look
like one.
* * * *
“Margaret”: Cat - breeders’ societies
say the term “tabby” applies to both
sexes, but only to grey cats with certain
well-defined black markings—two solid
lines along the back, evenly spaced rings
on the tail, etc. —resembling the coarse
water-waved silk material named tabby,
so-called after Attabiyeh, the quarter in
Baghdad where it was first made.
* * * *
“Wu Foo”: Jacky Blackstump, the
abo. help on the farm, shared with his
boss a taste for rum ; so when he saw
the boss return from an evening in
town, walk into the tractor-shed with
two bottles and return empty-handed,
Jacky’s eyes lit-up. Near midnight the
farmer and his wife were awakened by
screams coming from the shed; they
found Jacky writhing on the floor, beside
him an open bottle. On the victim’s
subsequent return from hospital after
stomach-pump treatment, the cocky com-
mented: “You silly cow, Jacky, couldn’t
you smell it was phenyle?” “No smellum,
boss,” said Jacky, “too plurry dark that
night!”
* * * *
“Emel”: The 139,000-acre Wyperfield
National Park, in the Victorian Mallee,
has clover growing on some of the flats,
the first observed in 40 years. It is
assumed that seeds gathered in its
passage through the wheatlands by the
Wimmera River reached the park in
overflows from Lake Albacutya, to
which, in wet seasons, the river finds
outlet through Lake Hindmarsh.
* * * *
T)edestrians crossing Brisbane’s Vic-
toria Bridge about 9-o’clock each
morning have a grandstand view of a
flock of pelicans being fed at the nearby
fishmarket wharf.
The birds begin to arrive shortly after
sun-up, in ones and twos ; by 8.30 there
are about 50 cruising on the river like
miniature yachts, waiting for the starting-
signal. The appearance on the wharf
of a man carrying a bucket of fish-scraps
causes a ding-dong scrum, which breaks-
up when he starts tossing the pieces out.
They have developed direction-anticipa-
tion to a fine art.
When the handout's finished they fly
off to their several fishing-spots. Many
people believe they breed at some secret
rendezvous around Moreton Bay.
Actually, their breeding-grounds are well
inland, embracing an area from the Gulf
of Carpentaria down through the back
country of eastern Australia. Location
depends on the conditions brought about
by previous rains. Their infallible
instinct tells them where there will be
plenty of food near at home for the
fledglings and plenty of swimming-space
when the time comes to leave the nest.

Time Means Tucker
By H. P. (“DUKE”) TRITTON
Illustrations chiefly from contemporary issues of The Bulletin.
Both of them 19-year-olds, the writer and his mate Dutchy have
set out from Sydney on a breezily adventurous wander about the N.S.W.
outback, learning to become shearers, doing fencing contracts and having
a go at gold-digging, singing and taking the hat round in the towns,
boxing in show booths, meeting picturesque characters and generally
getting to know the bush and bush folk, and taking life as they find it.
They have gone by boat to Newcastle, headed west from there, jumped
the rattler to Narrabri, and, characteristically, have done their share with
other volunteer firefighters in saving that town from being burnt down.
The year is 1905.
We had written to Young
and Co., shearing
contractors, of Syd-
ney, for pens, and
had given our address as
Narrabri Post Office. In those
days, you could write to Young
and Co. or the Federal Sheep
Shearing Co. enclosing £l, and
they would sign you up for
three sheds for the season. It
would be at least a week before
we get a reply, so we reckoned
we would have a look at Moree.
We hopped on a goods-train
expecting to be in Moree the
next day, but the guard had
spotted us, and, having a per-
verted sense of humor, left us in
peace till a few miles on the
Galathera Plain, then pulled-
up the train and ordered us
off.
We pointed out that our
Weight would not cause any.
Undue strain on the engine, but
he still insisted. Then we
invited him to throw us off, so
he brought the driver, fireman
and another railway-man who
happened to be on the train.
They had iron bars, so we
gave-up, and got off. When
the train moved off we sat for
a while discussing the probable
ancestry of the train-crew, but
soon, realising the futility of
this, we plodded after the train.
We kept to the lines, know-
ing there would be water-
tanks, for the use of the
fettlers, every few miles. We
were needing water already. It
was not until daylight that we
knew where we were. Looking
east we could see a mountain
range, possibly 20 miles away.
South we could just see the
timber. But west and north
nothing but an apparently
endless plain sweeping away to
the horizon. Not one tree to
break the monotonous expanse.
Roly-poly, old-man saltbush
and dry grass 2ft. high was the
only vegetation.
We had heard of the Gala-
thera Plain, but could not
imagine the immensity of it.
Thirty miles from tree to tree
does not seem much in these
motor-car days, but padding
the hoof under a burning sun
and perishing for a drink is a
different matter. We passed
several tanks, but all were dry.
This made matters worse, as
each tank we sighted we were
-sure would be filled with water,
so we forced our trembling
legs to a further effort, only to
be again disappointed.
We had counted 22 mile-
posts before we came to a tank
half-full of water. We managed
to restrain ourselves from
gulping too much. When we
were able to speak, Dutchy
said, “When I get back to
Sydney, I’m going to get
married, rear a lot of kids, tell
them of my sufferings on the
track, and if they don’t howl
I’ll tan the backsides off
them.”
T>eing on the track for a
" while teaches most men to
take things as they come. The
swagman’s philosophy can be
summed-up in a few words:
“Just a man’s blanky luck.”
We sighted Moree without
further incident, and found a
very pretty town. It was just
becoming known as a health-
resort. The town bore-water
' was highly mineralised, and
was noted for its medicinal
value. The baths were always
crowded with people, young
and old, who seemed to think
the water would cure them of
almost any ailment. 1 believe it
is very effective in a number of
complaints.
Our first business was to go
to the railway-yard to see if
we could have a few words
with any member of the train-
crew who had made us do a
perish on the Galathera Plain,
but the train had left for
Narrabri only an hour before.
We made a couple of pounds
singing, and would have done
much better, but there hap-
pened to be a travelling
concert-party in town, and they
objected, so the police asked
us to stop. They were quite
friendly about it; in fact, the
sergeant said we were putting
on a better show than the pro-
fessionals. He said we could
have an open go the following
night, but it rained heavily, so
we did not go out.
Back in Narrabri, our replies
from Young and Co. had
arrived, and we read them
eagerly. Both of us had asked
for shed-work—that is, wool-
rolling, piece-picking, penning-
up or picking-up—but I had
been given a learner’s pen,
which meant that I was an
apprentice shearer, while
Dutchy was given picking-up.
The three sheds -were
Charlton on the lower Bogan,
Calga, between Coonamble
and Coonabarabran, and
Rockedgtel, on the Liverpool
u r. , , ,
Charlton, the first shed, was
200 miles across-country, and
did not start till July 10, which
gave us 12 weeks to fill-in.
While we were still debating the
best way to do this a drover
came over and asked had we
ever done any droving. We told
him “No,” but that we would
like to have a shot at it. We
could both ride, and told him
Billy Waite had nothing on
us. He laughed and said:
“Well, I don’t have anything
like Bobs in my outfit, but
so long as you can ride a
quiet horse, and do as you are
told, you can come along.”
When he said he was taking
the sheep to Collarenebri we
reckoned we were in luck. It
would put us 100 miles nearer
Charlton.

New York Share Prices
With Wall Street share prices
back to near the all-time
peak again, a shrewd analysis
from New York says that the
high level is the result of a
belief that the U.S. economy
will undergo vigorous expan-
sion during the 1960’5, and that
the dollar will concurrently
continue to lose part of its
buying-power. “This situation
creates an optimism which has
allowed the market to run
far ahead of the business
recovery in 1958—an optimism
which has already carried the
market to levels that discount
a good part of the expansive
development expected in the
1960’5. Therefore, we can
expect, the market to take its
1959 direction from investment
psychology rather than from
sound business developments.”
That description of market
factors and background pretty
well fits in with the Australian
scene over the past 12 months,
Here there has been some
reaction from the high peaks
reached by the market favorites
m the front line. These peaks
were established on the ground
°f “investment psychology
rather than from sound busi-
ness developments.”
It has been The Bulletin’s
opinion for a considerable
period that while the long-
term prospects for Australian
industries are very attractive,
there has been a sharemarket
tendency to regard “market
increment” as the main source
of potential gain and to dis-
regard yields, present and in
the foreseeable future.
To chase sharemarket gains
without full regard to potential
income from the stock itself is
to bank on everyone else being,
in the end, a bigger sucker than
yourself. And that is a fatal
investment policy.
Australian Sharemarkets
'T’hough Australian share-
markets as a whole were
firm last week, the pattern of
the market was visible most
clearly in the better-class
second-liners. The front-
liners were generally steady at
something below their 1958
peak. The second-liners have
in many cases established new
peaks for the year, though
there is a marginal fringe
which is showing a reverse
trend, based, usually, on actual
trading setbacks suffered by
the companies represented by
the scrip.
For several weeks Aus-
tralian sharemarkets have
shown a more sensible tendency
in the selection and pricing of
investment stocks. If times are
going to be tougher next year
it will be easier to live with
a stock showing a reasonable
yield than with one giving a
miserable return, that has
resulted from overpricing a
good thing. Certainly our
key stocks should be
steadier than the average as
div.-payers in the event of a
slowing-down in our economic
momentum, but investigation
among second-liners will un-
cover stocks with almost
equally high div.-cover.
Takeovers Galore!
Tn a quite spectacular string
of big deals in Melbourne
last week Factors, Ltd., a

the early observers noted that
oil tended to accumulate near
the crests of folds where con-
ditions were favorable.
Thus the “anticlinal theory”
was born, and it has remained
—again when conditions other
than structure are also favor-
able —a very useful tool in the
hands of the discerning
petroleum geologist. It shouid
always be used, however, with
what Prof. John Perry
described as “gumption.”
When the other determining
factors to the “text-book” dis-
tribution of gas over oil over
water are unfavorable, the
identification of petroleum
exploration with a search for
anticlines and other “closed”
structures is merely chasing
failure.
For “text-book” conditions
to exist it is essential that the
fold being drilled shall contain
at least one continuous stratum
of well-sorted material of little-
changing porosity and of suffi-
cient permeability throughout,
both capped and bottomed by
impermeable beds. Then, and
then only, will gas be found at
the apex, oil in the flanks
immediately below the gas, and
brine (edge-water) in contact
with the lower interface of the
oil.
Such conditions prevail in a
comparatively few regions only,
most of them already nearing
exhaustion or being fully ex-
ploited. Even so, the gas-oil-
water distribution may be
drastically modified by selec-
tive migration.
In Australia —as I have often
pointed out the geological
conditions depart markedly
from the “text-book” concep-
tions, and the oil-harvest, as
might have been anticipated,
from wells sunk on the surface
apices of anticlinal folds has
been completely disappointing.
The early petroleum-
geologists were inclined to look
upon seepages of oil—and even
of gas, in the form of the so-
called “mud-volcanoes” as
favorable omens. It is now
recognised that seepages are
grounds for optimism only
where special conditions exist,
whilst proximity to mud-
volcanoes is generally regarded
with disfavor.
Seepages of petroleum—
whether occurring at the sur-
face or buried inevitably
indicate a leaking reservoir.
Sometimes the leak is so small,
compared with the capacity of
the reservoir, that the underly-
ing oil “pool” has not become
depleted, over the ages, below
a commercial level.
The rate of seepage is
dependent on the size of the
channel (or channels) along
which the oil is escaping, on
the viscosity of the oil, and—
a most important factor on
its self-sealing properties.
Mene Grande (“The Great
Seep”), on the east bank of
Maracaibo Lake in Venezuela,
is one case in which the under-
lying oil-reservoir has not been
depleted, in spite of the
millions of barrels of fluid dis-
sipated at the surface. The total
production of the field to date
approaches 500-million barrels
and is still going strong. It
owes its preservation to the
sealing effect of tars produced
as the result of the inspissation
of mixed-base crudes, in con-
junction with a geological
history of complex folding and
faulting and erosion,
Incidentally, the early de-
velopmental technique em-
ployed at Mene Grande was
controlled by the assumption
that the main seep marked the
crest of a simple anticline. This
idea, however, was soon dis-
pelled by drilling . data. As
most of the wells sunk pro-
duced oil, everyone was happy,
and it was a long time before
the true structure of the field
was understood.
The lower Mene Grande oils
are comparatively light, with
a specific-gravity of as low as
0.87, but the inspissated upper
oils are around the specific-
gravity of water ; the average
for the field is about 0.95, and
the chemical characteristics of
the oils vary with their specific-
gravity. The results obtained
from .Mene Grande were
responsible for much unprofit-
able seepage-drilling both
within and outside Venezuela —
by operators who did not
realise the special and unusual
combination of factors which
allowed Mene Grande to
become one of the wonder oil-
fields of the world, in spite of
its being a seepage area.
How little these factors are
understood in the current
drilling in Australia and its
environs is made clear by a
study of the recent reports by
some of the operating com-
panies.

refusal to have anything to
do with the promotion of
materials which are not “all
wool.” “Early in life I dis-
covered that when anything
was inevitable it was best to
associate yourself with it,” he
said. “Synthetics are inevit-
able, although I think nylon,
terylene, orlon and the new
Eastman discovery in the U.S.,
kodel, have skimmed the
cream.
“It is now a matter of blend-
ing them with wool. This suit
I’m wearing,” he said, glanc-
ing at his dark-blue outfit of
wonderful-looking material in
an old-fashioned cut, “is all
wool, but that’s because today
is a special occasion. For work
in Australia I wear 50 per
cent, wool and terylene and
in Britain 65 per cent, wool
and 35 per cent, terylene.
“The demand for woo) will
increase as backward coun-
tries like India raise their
standard of living.” (He
instanced India on a number
of subjects; apparently India
is in 1.C.1.’s focus, particularly
as to making her own fertilisers,
which 1.C.1. advocates.)
He complimented Aus-
tralians on having a higher
ratio of university students
than Britain because they
would support science on its
true modern pedestal, made it
clear 1.C.1. was careful not
to give 1.C.1.A.N.Z. anything
like instructions (K. G. Begg,
th 6 Australian company’s
chairman, smiled enigmatic-
ally), and said that, although
it was excellent for the Soviet,
the U.S. and any others with
the energy and resources to
send up sputniks and investi-
gate outer space, 1.C.1. was
more interested at present in
nearer-home matters such as
plastics and heat-resistance.
The new building is a
stunner. Melbourne and Vic-
toria is spread out panoramic-
ally from it for 70 miles,
former land ma rk s are
dwarfed, and the staff, sitting
up so high at their desks, say
it is frightening to see the
weather coming so clearly and
so far off.
It is 275 ft. 4in. high, has a
floor-area of 300,000 sq. ft.,
has two floors below street-
level under the 19-storied
main block, has space for 1500
office-workers, eight lifts rising
at 500 ft. a minute, a car-park
for 65 cars, a canteen for
400, a theatrette seating 110
and an air-conditioning system
that even eliminates humidity.
“I am encouraged to think
it is one of Australia’s finest
new buildings,” Sir Alexander
says in a foreword to a book-
let commemorating the open-
ing, “but it is something more
than that: it is a symbol of
Australia’s developing chemi-
cal industry.”
Victorians like to think of

of developing Australia, of
which, of course, 1.C.1. and its
A.N.Z. obviously have no
doubt.

“Late every morning—whoever he is.”
“diminishing-value” method,
Another amendment applied
when plant is sold ; instead of
being taxed on any surplus
above book-value (as was the
custom prior to the 1957-58
tax-year), the taxpayer may
elect to reduce the value of
other plant by that amount,
The effect is that, although in
the ultimate taxable income
under both methods is the
same, the full impact of taxa-
tion in any one year is modified,
Results of these taxation
amendments have been evi-
dent in the accounts of public
companies for the past 12
months, and have beeo
particularly noticeable in the
1957-58 figures of some com-
panies recently to hand. In
the case of Australian Con-
solidated Industries, Ltd., for
example, during the year to
June 30 last depreciation pro-
vision rose from £1,366,467 to
£2,101,127 ; net profit showed
little change at £2,152,436 after
tax provision of £2,096,886, up
£15,261.
The B.H.P. group, too, set
aside £lO.l million for depre-
ciation in 1957-58, compared
with £7.8 million in the
previous year, and £6.1 million
(up £2 million) for increased
cost of plant-replacement.
In each case the increase in
depreciation provision was pro-
portionately greater than the
increase in book-value of the
assets depreciated,
Higher depreciation allow-
ance is a feature of most of
the accounts of companies now
presenting their results,
l n the national -inc o m e
figures presented by Treasurer
Fadden in the late Budget
session the Commonwealth
Statistician points out that the
fall i n undistributed profits of
trading enterprises from £167
million in 1956-57 to £146
million , in 1957-58 resulted
mainly from the lower level
of company income, “which in
turn reflects higher rates of
depreciation now allowed.’'
“Further, allowances for
depreciation, which are esti-
mated in general on the basis
Q f the amounts allowed for
taxation purposes, have been
increasing rapidly in recent
years.” In total, undistributed
profits and allowances for
depreciation increased 7 p.c. in
1955-56, by 2 p.c. in 1956-57
aiK j by |3 p C> j n 1957-58.
Undistributed profits and
allowances for depreciation
comprise a large part of the
total funds available to business
for financing investment. In
1957-58 allowances for de-
preciation totalled £412 million,
compared with £325 million in
the preceding year.
Combined depreciation
allowance and undistributed
profit for 1957-58 was £558
million, compared with £492
million in 1956-57.
Readjustment Now?
'T'hf. impact of TV on retail
sales is likely to be
gradually undergoing readjust-
ment right now. It has been
reckoned by some authorities
that expenditure on TV over-
seas has even affected the world
price for wool. Certain it is
that in Australia TV has
diverted much retail spending
away from its traditional
course and at the same time
given the hire-purchase busi-
ness a big push along.
By now many TV’s will have
been paid-off, and the number
of new buyers is slackening
for the moment. The effect of
TV on retailing has by no
means en,ded, but changes can
be expected with the passing of
the peak of its first popularity.

Archibald Prize
Anybody visiting this year’s
Archibald and Wynne dis-
plays at the N. S. Wales
Gallery could be pardoned for
thinking that Australian art
has fallen down a hole and
vanished ; yet around the
exhibitions during the year
there have been dozens of lively
paintings. The artists haven’t
bothered to send in.
Why, is anybody’s guess.
Maybe they have lost faith in
the trustees’ judgment; though,
since the poor trustees are
always being attacked, simul-
taneously, for being too
modern and too conventional,
there doesn’t seem much
sense in that.
Maybe too many of the
artists are painting a kind of
genre-painting, with figures
moving about the landscape
or standing on their heads,
which they thought wouldn’t
be eligible for the Wynne ;
but they could always try it
out. Maybe too many are
painting abstracts, which they
think wouldn’t be eligible for
anything; yet one has seen
several abstracts, with a
glimpse of something recog-
nisable in them, which would
have been worth entering.
Maybe there are just too
many competitions; as un-
doubtedly there are. It is
both expensive and a nuisance
for artists to have to be con-
tinually sending their work all
over the country on the off-
chance of winning a lottery,
and it is disheartening to
keep on not winning. People
who want, to help art should
buy paintings from the usual
run of exhibitions instead of
forcing the artists into com-
petitions.
Whatever is the reason for
the decline, it is a pity; for
the Archibald prize-money, at
least, is pretty good, and both
these competitions are hal-
lowed by time and are genei>
ally regarded as a display-
window where you can see
the best of the year’s art.
In the poor field of the
Archibald, W. E. Pidgeon’s
good-humored and easy-going
portrait of Ray Walker was a
fair choice for first prize ; it
is alive and natural. There is
a finer quality in Carington
Smith’s self-portrait, but it is
a quiet rather than an exciting
statement, and there is not
much else to compete. Hele’s
two portraits, though handled
with assurance, sprawl out of
their frames too much;
Dargie’s portrait of a profes-
sor is interesting only in the
face; and Dobell is absent.
The entries by Charles Bush
and Scott Pendlebury are
worth mentioning.
In the equally poor field of
the Wynne the trustees must
have searched desperately to
find something that looked
alive, like a genuine effort by
one of the artists to excel
himself to win a competition ;
and in settling on Ronald
Steuart’s picture of the rocky
headland at Balmoral
beach, N. S. Wales, at least
they got a prizewinner which
attempted the unusual. The
cliffs, however, look as brittle
as porcelain, and the subject
would best be left for photo-
graphy. Francis Kenneth de
Silva’s very pleasing essay in
dark and silver in “Evening
on the Samford Range,
Queensland,” had more
quality and more sensitivity.
Charles Bush’s “Summer
Storm” and Lance Solomon’s
“in September” would have
been strong contenders for
the prize if both these artists
hadn't won the prize with
very similar paintings in the
past.

Melbourne
The Sedon Galleries’ current
Christmas exhibition includes
works by Tom Roberts,
Streeton and Norman Lindsay.
This doesn’t necessarily mean
great art, but it does mean
that the general public is much
more likely to see there what
it yearns for—work by artists
who are striving to paint
pictures that have some
reference to Nature, instead
of a reference to Picasso and
Modigliani, or the latest art
magazine from Paris or New
York.

Stage and Music
“The Messiah”
Given its annual airing
by the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra and the Hurlstone
Choir, Handel’s oratorio was
piloted with alert authority and
conviction by Norman Chinner
in a performance which, how-
ever, from the choral point
of view, left something to be
desired.
The Hurlstone Choir is a
weighty instrument, like
all our big choral forces, it is
not well balanced. It is also
carrying a fair proportion of
prunable deadwood, and it
badly needs an infusion of
trained youthful voices in each
of its four sections. The
“ Er — Knucklehamer, have you never pondered what
the little door at the side may be for?”
tenors in particular need
strengthening. But the choir's
attack is consistently good, and
it can, and did, invest such
choruses as “And the Glory
of the Lord” and the “Halle-
lujah” with a deal of soaring
ecstasy and fervor. Too often,
however, their words were
drowned by sheer voice-weight.
Sometimes this is admittedly
unavoidable, as when they are
pitted against a tutti orchestra,
but it was still too noticeable
when accompaniment was light,
The outstanding feature of
the solo singing was the work
of Marjorie Conley. Hers is
one of the best - quality
sopranos produced in Aus-
tralia for many years its
purity and sympathy make it
an ideal vehicle for the
numbers allotted by Handel to
the high voice. The highlight
of the night was the splendor
with which she invested the
work’s loveliest air, “Come
Unto Him.”
Raymond McDonald’s
tenor, always carefully con-
trolled, was heard to best
advantage in the opening
“Comfort Ye” and “Every
Valley.” Bass-baritone Noel
Melvin gave robust forthright-
ness to “Why Do the Nations?”
but less resonance than was
its due to “The People That
Walked in Darkness”;
Florence Taylor’s contralto had
less carrying-power than is
usual for her, which robbed
“He Shall Feed His Flock” of
some of its worth. Her singing
of “He Was Despised” was
much more acceptable.
The work of the orchestra
was unexceptionable through-
out.

from the Presence with a
very red face.
The English company pre-
senting their “intimate revue”
at the Comedy, Melbourne, is
not expected to retire back-
wards when we say that “For
Amusement Only” did not
amuse us. It amused some —
in fact they giggled, burbled
and exploded all the way
through the entertainment, no
doubt because it fitted in with
their associations, as it must
have done for a lot of people in
London, where it ran for two
years.
It didn't fit in with our
associations, however. We
were unable to see anything
particularly funny in the
elaborate skit oh those un-
fortunate mental cripples, the
bodgies and widgies, any more
than we would in a skit on
physical cripples. Nor did we
laugh our heads off at the all-
too-frequent allusions to
abnormal sexual manifestation.
The attitude of Messrs. Peter
Myers and Ronald Cass,
authors of “For Amusement
Only,” is as commonplace
and outdated as their attitude
to the widgies and the bodgies.
They are better in their skit
on “Summer of the 17th
Doll.” This is a play which
has been universally accepted,
and it may or may not deserve
it, but to point out its weak-
nesses if he thinks he sees
them in an accepted work of
art has been the legitimate job
of satirists from Aristophanes
to Voltaire and Shaw.

“Gate of Lilacs”
in this French film director
Rene Clair’s work is seen at
its authoritative best. His
down-to-earth Parisian-slum
characters react to the various
events exactly as one would
expect them, and they are
never better than they should
be. They all give the impres-
sion that they couldn’t be
dragged away from their
sordid environment, and Clair
has embroidered the basic
dramatic story with some
excellent touches of relieving
comedy.
A handsome young murderer
forces a couple of no-hopers
to hide him from the police in
their ramshackle diggings.
Finding him amiable enough,
they later go out of their way
to put the cops off the scent.
Then the pretty but susceptible
daughter of the estaminet-
keeper along the alley gets
involved with the criminal, but
the bullets that finally finish
him are fired by one of the no-
hopers, much less in the spirit
of saving. the girl from her
folly than in the more urgent
job of preserving his own hide.
It is all admirably in character.
Clair has made the two dead-
beats his central characters and
has been richly rewarded by
the performances of Pierre
Brasseur, as the fat, slothful,
wine-bibbing petty thief, and
George Brassens, as a philo-
sophic guitar-player, quiet and
kind-hearted but prepared to


drift through life and poverty.
Dany Carrel and Henri Vidal
handle the other parts capably.

“Rock-a-bye Baby”
Whether the sphere is the
legit. stage, vaudeville or
screen, a producer just can’t
miss in the quest for laughs if
his material includes a bumble-
fingered bachelor who is left
in charge of a baby. When, as
in this case, the bach, happens
to be screendom s champion
foozler and fumbler (Jerry
Lewis) and his care is three
babies, the riot is uproarious.
As usual, slapstick and im-
personations comprise the bulk
of the Lewis doings, and some
of them are exceedingly clever
There is a reasonably good
script, and the fun is aug-
mented by character-sketches
of style by the Italian bass-
singer - comedian, Baccaloni,
and by Reginald Gardiner.

“II Ferroviere”
The emotional explosions in
this Italian six-awards film are
50 to the minute, and the
present commentator was so un-
nerved by the finish that, when
he stepped out of the Savoy
Theatre into Russell Street.
Melbourne, and the exhaust of
a passing semi-trailer blew' off
with a mighty roar, he displayed
more exhilarating elevation
than David Blair does nightly
in “Giselle" at Her Majesty’s
Theatre.
Petro Germi both directs the
film and stars as Andrea
Marcocci, the driver of Italy’s
crack train, .the Electric
Express. He is a big-jawed
virile man who loves wine,
women and song and spends
his leisure from his arduous
duties accompanying roaring
choruses on his guitar in wine-
saloons, arriving home in the
small hours of the morning.
He hates as violently as he
loves, kisses his wife, daughter
and youngest son and then
stoushes his eldest son and
kicks him out of doors.
When he learns that his un-
married daughter is expecting
a baby he grabs a gun and
goes out to seek her seducer.
The shotgun-marriage he pro-
“Just as well we can lip-read , Joe”
duces ends in hatred. After
a terrified attempt to go off
with a former lover the girl
leaves her husband for a job
in a laundry. Marcocci is driv-
in S his express-train up to
schedule and thinking of his
multitudinous domestic prob-
lems when suddenly a would-
be suicide appears in the middle
of the track. He rams the
brakes on, but too late.
He sits devastated in his
cabin solacing himself with
the vino. A board of inquiry
degrades him to the rank of
goods-train driver. He joins
in a strike and then, having
been offered the job of driving
his beloved express, he becomes
a strike-breaker. He chucks
the railways and takes to the
taverns and the vino, but no
more the guitar because his
heart is broken. The little son
whom he loves and who loves
him picks him up on Christmas
Eve and leads him back to his
family.
There is an re-
union which beggars descrip-
tion. Friends pour in, he is
reconciled to his daughter and
her seducer, the vino is pouring
out in torrents, and everybody
is kissing and embracing. In-
spired, he picks up the guitar
and leads the mob in a roar-
ing chorus. The mob stumbles
homewards, and he is left with
his wife ; he picks up the guitar
and commences playing and
singing. The singing and the
playing stop, and she thinks
he is sleeping, but he is gone
to another world where there
are no domestic problems,
would-be suicides or expresses.
Vividly presented and acted
with smouldering violence by
Germi.

“Harry Black and the
Tiger”
A good - balance is held
between romance and action
in this Technicolored film set
in the jungles of India.
Black (Stewart Granger), a
tiger-hunter, meets again an
ex-p.-0.-w. (whose cowardice
during an unsuccessful escape-
attempt had cost Black a leg)
and his wife, with whom Black
had had a brief affair years
before. The three are thrown
together, and the old flame is
rekindled during a temporary
absence of the husband —
whose weakness and indecision
during a hunt almost cost
Black his life for the second
time. The logical denouement
makes no concession to the
box-office.
The tiger-hunt scenes are
realistic, and they are helped
greatly by the character-work
of Indian actor O. F. Lafar,
with an excellent line of
natural comedy. Granger,
more serious than usual, gives
his part distinction; and
Anthony Steel and Barbara
Rush are also acceptable in the
other main roles.

“Happy Is the Bride”
This English comedy gets
away to a good start with a
happy young man (lan
Carmichael) going blithely to
the creases in a village cricket-
match and belting his fiancee's
sire for two successive sixers
before realising that he hasn’t
yet got the old man's consent.
Then a herd of crossgrained,
vulturine relatives of the bride
descend on the house, a family
row threatens to break-up the
future partnership before it has
started, and the day is saved
only by the forthright if un-
orthodox action of the ’groom-
to-be.
The domestic scenes are
highly amusing and owe much
to the work of Cecil Parker, as
the bride's harassed father.
Miles Malleson is topnotch as
an ancient, deaf J.P. who, find-
ing the accused in a traffic case
is the young man about to
wed his old friend’s daughter,
disposes of the deponing cop’s
evidence with devastating logic

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
Elder, Smith and Co., Ltd.
A s very few purely pastoral concerns
appear on stock-exchange lists, the
full effect of last season’s drought and
slide in wool prices on the earnings of
individual woolgrowers hasn’t been
brought home to the sharemarket by the
publication of their shrunken profits, or
losses. If it had been, the cost-structures
of various groups of producers would,
probably, have attracted a lot more atten-
tion than that given in the past.
If the average cost of production of
wool and the price of synthetics are to
be the ultimate factors determining the
long-term range of wool values —and it
would appear that they must be —present
marginal producers, drawn-in by the
post-war boom, may well be tempted to
switch to other products (and, inci-
dentally, might then be using their land
for purposes for which it is better suited).
Some adjustments, therefore, seem
likely, but the gradual improvement in
the clip per sheep is expected to con-
tinue, and this would probably tend to
offset any decline in production by high-
cost producers, as well as strengthen the
margins of more efficient producers.
On present indications, it seems
that a slowly increasing clip of moderate
value will, in the next few years, make
a rather smaller contribution to Aus-
tralia’s export earnings than did the
average wool-Cheque for the seven years
to 1956-57 —a somewhat uncomfortable
thought with Australia heading for its
seventh balance-of-payments deficit in 10
years. Unfortunately, while the dizzy
and dangerous prices of the 1950-51
season are often remembered, the
abnormal circumstances responsible for
them are sometimes forgotten, and very
high prices, like a succession of good
seasons, regarded merely as “favorable”
rather than exceptional.
As Australia’s largest woolbroker,
Elder, Smith and Co. shares the fortunes
of the pastoralist, although the scope
of the co.’s operations shields it, to some
extent, from the full impact of variations
in wool-prices.
Last term’s combination of adverse
conditions reduced group turnover by
approximately 17 p.c., and, with an in-
crease in operating-costs, forced the
parent-co.’s earnings down to the lowest
point for four years. And in that four
years, Elder’s had absorbed Common-
wealth Wool and Produce Co., Ltd.
(Sydney), N.E.N.C.0., Ltd. (Newcastle),
Moreheads, Ltd. (Brisbane), along with
a number of smaller woolbroking con-
cerns, and almost doubled its all-ord.
paid capital (now £5,327,934).
Against this, the group continued to
consolidate its position in the industry,
handling, through branches in all main-
land States, 16.49 p.c. (717,874 bales) of
the smaller clip, compared with 15.43
p.c. (751,097 bales) in the preceding year.
There was a greater volume of turnover
in livestock, skins, hides and real-estate,
but, with the exception of real-estate,
sales-values were lower, while turnover
of the large merchandising-department
declined “noticeably” towards the end
of the term. All told, the value of group
turnover fell by £23.8 million to £119.5
million, the following table giving the
figures of the major departments:
1956. 1967. 1958.

over the four years back to 1954, the
div.-rate being cut from 12 p.c. to 10 p.c.
to accord with the lower earnings. In
119 years of trading, Elders has only
once failed to pay a div., last term’s
10 p.c. leaving the average rate for the
past decade at 11.4 p.c.
Shareholders were last asked for fresh
capital in 1955, new scrip being offered
(three-for-five) at a 50 p.c. premium.
Financially, Elder’s is well equipped
to cope with the inevitable fluctuations
in seasonal conditions and price-levels:

Creditors and advances figure as the
two largest items in the balance-sheet
and, as such, suggest the extent of the
co.’s banking activities, most of the addi-
tional £1,930,958 (net) made available
to subsidiaries last term going out to
clients. To help carry the larger sub-
sidiary debt, a net capital-outlay of
£350,476 and a rather sharp (27 p.c.)
increase in stocks, the parent ran down
holdings of cash, bonds, etc., by
£2,084,464, accepted an extra £353,234
on deposit and finished the term owing
creditors a further £687,558. As from
July 1 last the subsidiary cos. were
merged with the parent and the next
set of accounts may give a better picture
of the organisation as a whole.
With proceeds from Australian wool
sales in the first four months of the
year down £44 million on the figure for
the same period last season, the current
term promises to be even more difficult
than the last. Nevertheless, the share-
market expects the 10 p.c. div.-rate to be
maintained and prices the 12s. paid ords.
at 225. 6d. for a yield of £5 6s. Bd. The
uncalled liability on the scrip is regarded
as an “ultimate reserve.”

are probably worth more than twice the
amount at which they appear in the
accounts), the parent co. showed 38s. 6d.

still-current problems against past earn-
ings, the board went on to write net
profit at £80,045 —a modest sum when
compared with the £1,840,000 paid
capital, but still a great improvement on
the £163,123 loss turned-in in 1956-57.
In business since 1921, the Malcolm
Moore organisation grew-up on the
manufacture of mobile and overhead
cranes, bulk-handling equipment, con-
veyer-systems and light roadmaking-
machinery. Other, manufacturing in-
terests now include the fabrication of
structural steelwork and the production
of mechanical farm - implements,
hydraulic equipment for use in tractors
and with tractor-attachments, power-
steering units, hydraulic transmissions,
pumps, valves, etc. As a distributor the
group handles heavy trucks, loaders and
a large range of roadmaking-machinery,
tractors and associated equipment.
Most of the parent co.’s recent troubles
stem from the poor showing made by
its expanded road-machinery offshoot,
v/hich a few years ago found itself with
large stocks, an ambitious tractor-
manufacturing programme and a rapidly-
shrinking market. A “major setback”
suffered by this subsidiary in the 1956
term reversed the upward trend of group-
earnings and was followed in 1956-57
by a loss of over £225,000, which com-
pletely swamped the profits won by other
subsidiaries and led to the big group-
deficit for that year. Plans for the
manufacture of crawler - tractors were
announced in 1955, and fresh capital
put-up for the purpose, but understand-
ably enough, nothing has been heard of
the project for some time.
Unfortunately for ord. shareholders
portion of the large amounts of share-
capital raised by one-for-one issues in
1952 (at 100 p.c. premium) and in 1955
(at par) is tied-up in the stocks and other
assets of the road-machinery co. After
receiving a 74 p.c. div. in 1956, instead
of the forecast 10 p.c., they missed-out
entirely in 1957 and collected a dis-
appointing 3 p.c. out of last term's earn-
ings. Divs. were calculated on a 15 p.c.
basis in 1955 and 1954 and on a 20 p.c.
basis in the four preceding years.
Road-machinery stocks were cut by
£65,000 last term, but other stocks in-
creased by approximately £150,000, to
leave the total book-value, after deducting
the £400,000 provision, at £2,085,381, or
almost 56 p.c. of all assets. Book-debts
fell by £36,804, the sale of two properties
previously used in the road-machinery
business helping to ease a tight liquid
position. While the amount due to
creditors rose by £65,035, the liability
to the bank was reduced by £178,790.
Nevertheless, a “very substantial core”
of dead stock (road-machinery, spares
and equipment, trade-in tractors, etc.)
has yet to be moved to restore the balance
between “quick” assets (debtors and cash)
and creditors:

At June 30 last fixed assets were in
the accounts at cost, less depreciation,
and it is now proposed to revalue free-
hold and leasehold properties “as a
counterbalance to the asset position of
the co.” While this may be of some
interest in view of long-term plans for
transferring the main plant from Port
Melbourne to Springvale (an outer-
suburb of Melbourne) it is no more than
a book-entry as far as earnings are con-
cerned.
Excluding subsidiary losses, pre - tax
earnings last term were £129,536, as
against £101,601 in 1956-57, but even
more encouraging was the big reduction
in subsidiary losses, down £196,483 at
£29,528, covering, presumably, the road-
machinery offshoot and a “disappointing
and unsatisfactory venture” designed to
use trade-in tractors for clearing and
ploughing at Esperance (W.A.). Before
arriving at the £80,045 group profit,
£20,000 (down £18,750) was set aside for
tax and £65,094 (up £3534) for deprecia-
tion :

A number of new franchises have been
secured for Moore Road Machinery

diverting work from the engineering-
offshoots. Although earnings are small
in relation to the capital invested, this
co. is now reported to be operating profit-
ably, with the group as a whole meeting
budget-targets.
Unless there is a “grave deterioration”
in trading conditions the board expects
the current term to produce a profit
“capable of sustaining a reasonable

better things ahead, prices the f.-p. £1

Deducted to strike the above result for
the latest term was an incongruous
£359,982 (1957, £327,753) claimed for tax
purposes, £20,866 higher than the net
profit as claimed, and a not unhealthy
£155,169 for depreciation (£140,406).
No subsidiary made a loss for the year,
and it seems safe to discard the visible
26.1 p.c. returned on ordinary capital as
purely comparative in evaluating the real
potentialities of this stock.
Supporting this view is the £385,000
whipped-out during the year and added
to reserves, leaving, one may reasonably
surmise, inner reserves far from
exhausted.
Subject to any Government aetjon with
respect to margarine quotas, 15 p.c. div.
looks particularly safe, even despite the
new capital'added during the year. About
12 morphs ago Marrickville Holdings
offered shareholders three new 20s.

capital subsequently went up by £291,375.

The large increase in stocks
is sufficiently striking and un-
usual to have been accom-
panied by specific comment
from the board. The increase
in book-debts and creditors
has been more normal.
Capital-outlay on the Sydney,
Newcastle and Brisbane plants
continues at a brisk pace, and
new premises in Melbourne
are nearly ready for occupa-
tion. Tenders have been
accepted for the construction
of new factories at Adelaide
and Townsville. All told, dur-
ing the year, a net £197,126
was added to the book-value
of fixed assets after allowing
for depreciation.

held by the A.M.P. Society, all
nice, inexpensive loan-money.
Though through very con-
servative accounting the true
reserve position is even better
than it looks, it should not be
overrated, since freeholds are
at 1951 valuation plus subse-
quent additions at cost, less an
unstated amount for deprecia-
tion.
A few years back there were
sharp clashes over the question
of oleomargarine manufacture
when the Cahill Government
suddenly increased the N.S.W.
quota from 2500 tons to 9000
tons, to the consternation of
small producers in other States.
Jn all States the level of mar-
garine production is restricted
by legislation as a protective
measure for dairy-producers,
but such legislation has not
been strictly enforced.
Embers of this contentious
question were rekindled in
recent weeks, when the price
of a pound of margarine was
suddenly lifted by sd. to 2s.
6|d., ostensibly to safeguard
sales of butter, priced at 4s. 9d.
Whether the countervailing
effect of this move will operate
to cut-back Marrickville Hold-
ings’ earning-rate is very much
open to doubt; probably any
drop in margarine sales will be
more than cancelled-out by the
higher profit-margin.

show that each 20s. of ord.
scrip carried 395. Id. of net

expected, the market gives the

To fill this vacuum of per-
sonal ownership, the party tries
to build-up the idea that all
citizens are part-owners of all
industry. This is where the
union enters the scene with the
job of persuading its members
that the worth of their owner-
ship depends entirely upon the
production they achieve. The
worker who isn’t particularly
“bustin’ a gut” over the job is
apt to find fellow union-
members having a “serious
talk” with him about his
failure to pull his weight in the
joint-enterprise.
By the same token, the
union can have similar
“fatherly talks” with foremen,
supervisors or top-manage-
ment if it is felt they are un-
satisfactory contributors to
production.
Another union function in
the name of increased produc-
tion is the personal glorifica-
tion of a member who slaves
his way to new heights of pro-
duction. Hundreds of posters
extol him, not only around the
plant but in places of public
and social gathering. Founda-
tions for this hero-worship are
laid in union-operated kinder-
gartens where children are
taught from the jump that
patriotism means conquering
quotas.
The union has at least one
very convincing incentive for
making production its major
interest —the union’s income is
geared directly to its members’
productivity. For a start, union
membership-dues are calcu-
lated on a basis of one per
cent, of the worker’s wages.
On top of that, the steel-
workers’ union gets an annual
handout from the industry
totalling 8.5 per cent, of the
wages paid during the year.
(Other unions are on a similar
cop except that the handouts
vary according to the industry,
ranging from six to 16 per
cent.) ‘
Since the industry's payroll
depends greatly on the bonus
each worker earns for meeting
or beating quotas, the union’s
interest in production is
obvious.
As major employees in the
leading capitalist society,
Ryerson and his fellow-
deiegates were particularly
keen to get some idea what
sort of a deal the worker is
getting under Communism
these days. Broadly, they
found that while the Russian
worker’s conditions have
slightly improved, they cer-
tainly wouldn’t go within long
shooting-distance of persuad-
ing any “slave of capitalism”
that he was working on the
wrong side of the fence.
Some improvements came in
around the same time as
Khrushchev’s decentralisation-
of-management programme —
and doubtless played a part in
the increased production
claimed since then. Wages of
the workers were increased, and
in many industries, including
steel, working - hours were
reduced. Also, under the
Khrushchev regime some
attempt has been made to
increase production of con-
sumer-goods and housing.
One notion the Communists
have had to scrap is the airy-
fairy theory of a uniform wage
for all workers. They’ve had
to fall back on such capitalis-
tic tricks as bonuses, incentive-
payments (condemned by
Leftists in Australian unions)
and the revolutionary idea of
different levels of wages for
different levels of skill. Every-
one in a steel, plant, from
unskilled laborers to plant-
director, gets firstly a base
wage and, on top of that, a
bonus based on meeting or
beating quotas.. All office-
workers get the same bonus
when quotas are met.
To give some idea of the
general relationship, an un-
skilled laborer collects a mini-
mum monthly base wage of
700 roubles. A skilled worker,
with bonus, can get up to 3200
roubles. The average for
skilled and unskilled workers,
with bonus, is around 1300
roubles. A crane-operator gets
about 2000 roubles base wage
with up to 35 per cent, incre-
ment in the way of bonuses.
Chiefs of departments get 2500
roubles plus about the same
maximum bonus. The presi-
dent of the plant-union, work-
ing full-time on union affairs
(as do up to half-a-dozen union
committee - presidents in a
plant) collects 2500 roubles
paid by the union, and no
bonus, which seems a bit tough
when his chief aim is upping
the bonus of his members.
The director of a big steel-
plant has a base salary of 5000
roubles plus up to 50 per cent,
bonus, and gets the rare
luxuries of his own car and a
telephone in his home, plus the
crowning glory of a private
railroad - car on “special
occasions.”
Ryerson's delegation was
able to shop around and get
a first-hand notion of the cost
of just about everything in the
way of necessities and luxuries
available for purchase by the
average steelworker. But the
value of the rouble in terms
of any overseas currency is a
bit hard to assess.
The official rate stated by the
Government is four roubles to
the dollar. But Ryerson’s dele-
gation found that they, and any
visitors, were given 10 roubles
for their capitalistic dollar. Of
course, the international value
of the rouble depends upon
how the Russians are making
out in their trade-bartering.
Asa basis for assessing the
economic life of the Soviet
steelworker the American dele-
gation took the price in roubles
of a list of everyday com-
modities and worked them out
in terms of the worker’s earn-
ings per hour. For this, they
took the figure of 1300 roubles
per month, which was given to
them by the Russian authori-
ties as the average worker’s
earnings at two of the biggest
Soviet steel - plants. This
worked out at 6.66 roubles per
hour “take-home” pay after
deducting seven per cent,
income-tax.
For a comparison they took
from the 1957 statistics of the
American Iron and Steel
Institute the figure of 2.38
dollars as the take-home pay
of the average American steel-
worker after deducting 12.5
per cent, income-tax.
And so to what the respec-
tive toder can buy under
Communism and capitalism.
To be fair, let’s mention first
the only three items out of 30
on which the Soviet worker
seems to be getting it cheaper.
One of them is a very import-
ant, in fact major, item—rent.
For renting 400 square-feet of
living-space, the Russki worker
toils about 12.8 hours a month,
while h;s Yank opposite .num-
ber works 21 hours. Left out,
°f course, is the question of
what the worker is renting
aside from 400 square-feet.
Union-dues (for what he
gets for them) cost the Russian
worker about three minutes'
less work per month than the
American. And if he really
wants to hit the high spots
the Russian can have a
haircut for about a quarter-of-
an-hour of his own work, while
it will cost the American
worker half-an-hour's toil.
In the food line, bread and
spuds are merely 25 per cent,
dearer i'or the Russian worker.
But meat costs more than twice
as much in Russia as in
America—and by Australian
standards meat is outrageously
dear in America. Chocolate
might not rate exactly as an
essential food, but counting it
as a mild luxury, it takes the
Russian worker more than 32
times as long to earn the price
of a quarter-pound block.
For other items—well, let’s
just list them as the American
delegation found them:
tost in hours of work required for
average steelworker.

Some of the prices are odd
by local standards. While it
takes the Russian about half-
a-month’s wages to buy a bike
or a small radio, a refrigerator,
strangely, costs less than either.
The American delegation also
worked-out that, on the relative
Russian prices of a bus-fare,
a pound of butter and a
quarter-pound bar of choco-
late, a New Yorker on the
same footing would be paying
about a tenner a pound for
butter and £6 for a chocolate-
bar.
A gainst what these figures
1 v seem to show, it has to be
recognised that the Russian
worker has a completely dif-
ferent mental attitude. He is
conditioned to believing that
personal consumption, con-
sumer-goods and housing are
all worthy sacrifices for the
building-up of capital-goods
industries and the national
welfare.
Working-conditions? Weil,
the American team’s observa-
tion was that while the “labor
union” concerned itself no end
about production-goals, it
didn’t seem to give a tinker’s
cuss about workers’ conditions,
although delegates were told
that one function of the union
was to assist in safety pro-
grammes.
From what they saw, they
concluded that a Russian steel-
mill uses from 25 p.c. to 50 p.c.
more man - hours to pro-
duce a ton of a given product
than American mills. It
seemed to them that money
was spent extravagantly on
machinery and equipment to
avoid any possibility that lack
of equipment might be blamed
for delayed production. At
one big steel-shop, with 13
open-hearth furnaces, the dele-
gation's technical men reck-
oned that the equipment con-
sisting of nine pit-cranes,
seven charging-machines and
four floor-cranes was about
double that used in a similar
U.S. shop. And they observed
that the Russian plants used
methods to increase production
at the sacrifice of safety and
working-conditions by overseas
standards.
As to comparative safety of
working-conditions, the Ameri-
cans found that at one big
Russian plant (not singled-out
for a bad record) there had
been 720 lost-time accidents
the previous year, including
four fatalities and six cases of
severe disability. This is
roughly 23 times the accident-
rate in a comparable U.S.
plant.
The wearing of safety equip-
ment seemed to be almost nil.
Steel - capped safety - boots
were conspicuous by their,
absence, and protective cloth-
ing, such as safety-helmets,
was not sighted in any. plant
visited. Goggles were used only
for welding and burning,
although eye injuries are com-
mon all through steel-plant
operations. In general, the
workers seemed to lake a great
many risks that would have
unions and safety-authorities
screaming to high heaven in
any Western country. Finally,
the Americans’ tour, presum-
ably conducted along the most
favorable channels, gave the
impression that sanitary facili-
ties in plants, including any-
thing in the way of toilets and
drinking - water, were a long
way behind accepted standards.
The worker’s home-life is
conditioned by the fact that
the importance of the indi-
vidual in Russia today is purely
a matter of group-efforts in
advancing the progress of the
country, or on how he’s
making out with the party.
Either way, social life has
simply nothing to do with the
home. Russia today has no

Tableland Tin Dredging
To quote from a recent report
by the Bureau of Mineral
Resources, “the Australian tin
industry has been in a rather
indifferent condition for some
years,” and, judging from the
disappointing performance put-
U P one tbe l ar B est
producers, Tableland Tin
Dredging, N.L., the bureau
sn t understating the position,
With the opening last year
of B.H.P.’s tinplate-works at
Pt. Kembla (N.S.W.), Austra-
lian consumption of tin has
jumped by around 1000 tons
P- a - anc l is now approaching
3500 tons a year. Another 1000
t° ns will probably be added
to this figure within the next
f°ur or five years,
Meanwhile, local production
of tin has tended to decline
and, under existing conditions,
appears unlikely to rise much
above an annual output of
2000 tons.
The bulk of the world’s tin
is produced in cheap-labor
countries, and as prices received
by local tin-miners are based
on world prices, at present
depressed by an oversupply of
the metal, many producers
have found difficulty in earning
a worth-while profit and, with
some exceptions, see little
incentive for fresh investment.
Against this background,
assistance in the form of a
guaranteed minimum price and
taxation-relief is being sought
from the Federal Government,
Tableland Tin chairman, G. H.
Watson, urging, in addition, a
Tariff Board inquiry into the
state of the industry as a whole.
Shareholders first put their
money into Tableland Tin in
1937 and waited 10 years for
the initial div., an 8 p.c. pay-
out, repeated in 1948, ’49 and
’5O. Depletion of leases in 1951
caused the transfer of operations
to Smith’s Creek, Mt. Garnet
(Q.), the co. relying on bank-
advances of £300,000 to cover
the cost of the move. At June
30 last there was still £90,577
of transfer and re-establish-
ment costs to be written-off.
Although the co. made a
far better showing last term
(to June 30) than it did in the
previous year, ord. - share-
holders missed - out again,
ord. divs. last going out in
1956 (13 p.c.) and 1955 (8 p.c.).
However, pref, divs. were
brought up to date and the
outlook for ord. shareholders
looks somewhat brighter.
The dredge encountered
easier digging conditions and
higher values, handling

A pleasing reduction in work-
ing-costs, down 6.496 d. per c.y.
at 20.268 per c.y., was due
mainly to the switch from co.-
generated to Electricity Board
power and to the higher
throughput made possible by
easier working conditions.
The price of metallic tin
dropped steadily over the year,
falling from £953 to £913 a ton,
but, as far as income was con-
cerned, this was offset by the
improvement in production.
Tin sales, after adjusting for
stocks, brought in £361,754 (up
£36,637), another £2076 (down
£4778) coming in as rent,
interest, etc. Expenses, includ-
ing £2661 (down £214) for
depreciation, fell by £57,199 to
give a net profit of £60,052,
compared with a loss of
£29,006 in the previous year:

holders as divs. for the 1957
and 1958 terms. As in the past,
no provision was made for
amortisation of the dredge-
plant, etc., or Tor the cost of
future movements (within the
leases) of the dredge.
Currently troubling the
board is the cost, estimated at
around £20,000 a year, of com-
plying with State Government
requirements regarding the dis-
charge of dirty water into the
Herbert River.
The available yardage at
Smith’s Creek is expected to
keep the dredge in operation
for seven to nine years.
At June 30 the £153,074 of

Flexibility of Economy Demonstrated
A.N.Z Bank Chairman’s Statement
The Eighth Annual General Meeting of Australia and New
Zealand Bank Limited will be held in London on Wednesday,
7th January, 1959. The following is an extract from the Statement
by the Chairman, the Hon. Sir Geoffrey C. Gibbs, K.C.M.G.
While still very dependent
on oversea markets, Australia
is all the time becoming less
vulnerable to conditions abroad,
as evidenced by the sustained
high level of internal activity
despite the adverse season and
reduced export prices. The
pressure of demand upon avail-
able resources was lower than
in recent years, and, although
some unemployment appeared,
this was small by comparison
with most countries of the
western world.
In contrast to banking policy
in recent years, bank advances
were permitted to rise under
the stimulus of demands to
sustain the general level of
business activity and to meet
the requirements of primary
producers in need of carry-on
finance as a result of the
adverse season.
FACTORY PRODUCTION
The success of the policy of
internal credit expansion is well
illustrated by the movements
in the A.N.Z. Bank Index of
Factory Production. It shows
a rise in factory production
from 100 in the base year 1953-
54 to 128 in 1957-58. The rise
was steepest in 1954-55, but the
rise of 8 p.c. in 1957-58 must be
regarded as a significant
achievement at a time when
world commodity prices were
tending downwards and the
tempo of business activity in
most countries of the western
world, and particularly the
major industrial countries, was
reduced.
With the reduced prices for
exports, it appears certain that
there will be a substantial
adverse balance of payments to
be faced for the current
financial year, and, thus, a con-
siderable reduction in oversea
currency resources. There is
little need for concern at the
likely rundown this financial
year, but next year it could be
a different matter if world corn-
modity prices decline further,
From Australia’s point of
view the situation is more corn-
plex than the simple exporta-
tion of primary commodities in
exchange for manufactured
consumer goods. A high pro-
portion of Australia’s imports
now consists of raw materials
and processed goods for local
manufacturing industries,
Maintenance of activity in the
home manufacturing industries
tbu s depends, to a large extent,
on a satisfactory scale of im-
ports. Exports from Australia
are still predominantly primary
commodities, but manufactured
goods are of growing signifi-
cance. Australia is well placed
for the export of goods to the
East and particularly to South-

FLEXIBLE ECONOMY
The flexibility of the Aus-
tralian economy, which has
been amply demonstrated in the
period under review, should
enable the necessary adjust-
ments to be made to meet the
dictates of world market forces,
The continuing demand for
food and raw materials must
reassert itself before long, and
producers of these can surely
look forward to the future with
confidence.

From Herbert Holman
f\NLY the half-blind would
'“'fail to notice how the face of
London has changed in the past
few years. The City, for
instance, is fast becoming un-
recognisable : huge office-
blocks have completely changed
the skyline; they dwarf the
Wren churches and make other
once-glorious buildings seem
dowdy, old-fashioned and
insignificant.
The West End, too, has a
new face. Romano’s, Fras-
cati’s and the Monico are all
gone—and so, too, is that more
plebeian banqueting hall, the
Holborn Restaurant. The
corner-houses are still with us,
though greatly different in
appeal. Vast sums of money
have been, and are being, spent
in structural alterations and
refurnishing to keep abreast
with competition from the new
type of restaurateur who,
exemplified by the redoubtable
Charles Forte, has transformed
the leisurely meal into a
sumptuous snack.
Formerly, the diner-out was
well-to-do or, perhaps, temp-
orarily flush. Now he is
Everyman, whose custom must
be won by a dazzling front, a
not too expensive-looking
interior and competitive
(though by no means cheap)
prices. The “foreign” restau-
rants in the hinterland of Soho
which used to appeal to the
more adventurous are on the
wane. Finding that the
customer who likes to take his
time over an individually-
cooked meal and a bottle of
wine avoids the West End, they
have followed him to the cosily
bohemian districts of Chelsea
and South Kensington.
Music, Too
That changes, violent or
imperceptible, are constantly
taking place in most aspects of
human experience, even in the
arts, is inescapable. But I am
still trying to recover from the
shock of hearing the new
Mozart; having believed that
the interpretation of his works
depended primarily upon tradi-
tion.
Yet the greatest Mozartian
of this age, Sir Thomas
Beecham, conducted the
“Haffner” Symphony as if it
had been composed by the later
Beethoven and made it sound
as if it had. The shock is not
so much due to a conflict over
the interpretation (although
this work was, after all, a
serenade) but to the realisa-
tion that Beecham’s rendering
sounded perfectly right!
What might well have re-
flected an old man’s gentleness
(he is nearly 80 and walks with
difficulty) became an affair of
passion and dynamics, which
suggested that Sir Thomas’s
many recording sessions had
caused him unconsciously to
alter his style.
To make nonsense of this
he went to conduct a perform-
ance of the clarinet concerto
in traditional eighteenth-
century manner, delicate,
aristocratic and impeccable ;
the accompaniment to the
adagio was especially beautiful,
bringing out answers to the
solo instrument that had never
been noticed before. Sympa-
thetic to the clarinet's tech-
nical difficulties and to its lack
of power, Beecham took second
place, even to allowing the
soloist to give the beat. The
result fluent passage-work
and relaxed loveliness —was
very different from a previous
occasion when the same
soloist, under a brilliant but
exacting conductor, was so
ill-at-ease and out-of-breath
that he lost his intonation and
muffed a cadenza.
The remaining works were
the two last symphonies, again
distinct in interpretation : the
G Minor was dark and fore-
boding, while the C Major was
brilliant and exultant.
At Covent Garden, Rafael
Kubelik has revived “The
Bartered Bride.” It is a bright,
extrovert performance with an
outstanding and most sensitive
Marenka from Elsie Morison.
But, although the producer has
at his command a stage and
all its appurtenances, there is
too much light and too little
shade. This lack of variation
induces a monotony which is
not relieved by the straight-
forward pleasantness of
Smetana’s music and which
might have been avoided by a
less conventional treatment.
The result should be most
interesting if, according to
rumor, Beecham goes back to
the Garden as guest-conductor.
Profuse Strains
Our theatres may, in the
middle of a boom in office-
property, be considered “un-
economic sites,” but it does not
follow that show-business is
unremunerative. Fortunes are
being made by the lucky few
who are in occupation, for the
demand for theatres greatly
exceeds the number available.
If this is unfortunate for the
drama and for the many new
playwrights who are coming
forward, one result is the re-
emergence of indigenous
musical comedy. Not long ago,
importations from Broadway
held the monopoly. British
managements were reluctant to
risk the heavy production costs,
with the result that the enter-
prising had to budget on a
shoestring, with a small cast
and a two-piano-and-drums
accompaniment. Meanwhile,
after wrestling inconclusively
with the idiom, audiences began
to stay away from American
shows. Easy profits became
five-figure losses, causing the
backers to withdraw.
This made way for the
“shoestring” musical : “Saiad
Days” began as a Christmas
frolic and “The Boy Friend”
as a late-night entertainment.
Both are still running, with
the latter second only to “Chou
Chin Chow” in duration.
There are now no fewer than
nine musicals in the West End.
One (“Irma la Douce") is
French and three are American.
Of these, only one (the new
“West Side Story”) is 100 per
cent. U.S.—the others (“My
Fair Lady” and “Where's
Charley?”) are British in
origin.
Of the rest, “Expresso
Bongo” is an exceedingly
bitter satire on Tin Pan Alley
and its exploitation of teenage
immaturity. Since the music
is loud, discordant and grating,
the treatment of youth is un-
sympathetic and “dog bites
dog" in the sense that show-
business pillories show-busi-
ness, one wonders how this ever
came to be put on, for it would
appear to alienate audiences
rather than appeal to them.
It is, nevertheless, doing well.
Sandy Wilson, still living in
the past that he never knew
(he was born in 1924), has
bravely tried to adapt Ronald
Firbank. He has borrowed
Cardinal Pirelli from the
eponymous novel and fitted him
into “Valmouth.” The result
is the weirdest extravaganza
since “The Happy Hypocrite.”
As Firbank’s grotesque pre-
ciosity is not to everybody’s
taste, this musical lacks the
universality of “The Boy
Friend.” The characters, too,
are so highly spiced as to turn
the stomach.
“Chrysanthemum,” set in
1913, is less well-knit, but has
the the virtue of sending
everyone away in a state of
mild euphoria. The formula is
the old one of clown and zany.
Pat Kirkwood, as a nice Eng-
lish girl whisked away into low
company (but, of course,
retaining her virtue and inno-
cence) fools engagingly through
a variety of escapades and is
brilliantly supported by a
classical actor, Hubert Gregg,
as the stolid but constant man-
of-property whose sister she
rescues from abduction and
whose love she' engagingly
manoeuvres. Unusually, wed-
ding-bells (nearly) close the first
act. The words, music and pro-
duction, if not consistently of
high standard, have many
delightful touches of wit and
burlesque.


cook, a tall man, with a fair-
dinkum walrus mo.; Arthur
Carter, a returned man from
the Boer War; and Jack
Cameron, a squatter’s son who
was on the trip for experience.
The horses were a good lot,
and so were the dogs. The
rest of the outfit was poor, and
would be classed as “quart-
pot.” The only conveyance
was a sulky, which, when
loaded with the cooking
utensils, tucker and the cook
left no room for anything
else.
Swags were carried on our
saddles. A good droving-
outfit always carried rolls of
hessian to make a yard round
the sheep at night. As we had
none of it we had to watch the
sheep. We generally managed
to get them in a fenced corner,
.or sometimes a bend in the
Namoi River, but we would
still have a couple of hundred
yards to patrol. Fires were
lighted and the dogs tied-up
between them. Two hours for
each man, with the cook doing
the last watch and getting
breakfast ready in between
patrols.
I found it very eerie for the
first few nights. The fires
reflected the eyes of the sheep,
and the effect was rather
ghastly. The cud-chewing was
even worse. Seven-thousand
sheep make a surprising lot of
noise when all their jaws are
moving. It sounded like a
distant surf. I would just be
getting used to it when every
sheep would swallow, and for
a few seconds the silence was
oppressive; then they would
bring up another wad, and the
noise would start off again.
On our second night we were
at Wee Waa, a small town
20 miles from Narrabri. Wee
Waa is on the site of what had
been one of the bora-grounds,
where the aborigines used to
hold their ceremonial rites, and
there had been a meeting of
the tribes over the previous
week. Most had gone back
to their mission-station and
reserves, but there were about
200 at the camp.
The authorities were sending
them home in groups, and the
stations along their various
routes had been asked to help
them on their way with rations.
Most of the squatters had
agreed to this, as it would mean
the abos. would not kill sheep
or cattle if they had it given
to them.
In the morning we counted
83 men and women going past
our camp. This mob was from
Queensland, but I don’t know
which part. Most of the men
had their paint still on, and
carried spears, boomerangs and
hefty waddies. Dutchy and I
thought they were a tough-
looking lot, but the rest of the
outfit didn’t seem very im-
pressed. Perhaps they were
being casual about it to im-
press Dutchy and me. I noticed
that the women carried all the
camp-gear, and sometimes the
weapons also, while their lords
and masters strolled along in
front of them, proud of their
white stripes and great beards.
I think this was the last of
the big corroborees in N.S.W.
/"'VNE, and a very important,
rule of the stock-routes
was the giving of notice of
stock movements. Each land-
holder on the route had to be
warned that the stock would

the N.S.W. National Art
Gallery in 1900).
cross his boundary, 24 hours in
advance of the actual crossing-
time. This notice had to be a
note delivered by hand. It
gave him time to shift his stock
off the route and avoid getting
his sheep mixed-up with the
travelling mob.
This was known as “boxing-
up.” In the event of two mobs
getting “boxed” they would
have to be taken to the nearest
yard and drafted out. This
would sometimes take a week,
apart from starting a' lot of
arguments, as “Banjo” Pater-
son mentions in “Saltbush
Bill.”
Also, if the fault lay with
the drover he would have to
pay the cost of the drafting. A
squatter had been known to
put on a dozen men when two
could have done the job, to
teach the drover a lesson.
I had the job of “telegraph-
rider,” as it was called. North
Merah was the next station to
be notified. About three miles
from where we had camped I
passed four aboriginal women
well behind the main mob.
One of them, even to my in-
experienced eyes, was preg-
nant. I waved to them, and
went on. I passed the others,
who, I was secretly pleased to
see, were some distance off
the road.
I delivered the note at the
station, and the manager said
he would have all stock off the
route, and a couple of men at
the boundary to assist us
through. He asked how far
back the aborigines were. I
said I thought they would reach
the station some time in -ihe
afternoon. He had killed a
bullock, and had it all cut-up
ready for them. He then
invited me to have a feed at the
men’s hut, which I gladly
accepted. The tucker that Joe
Churchlands turned on was no
improvement on track tucker,
and I enjoyed a good meal.
On my way back to the sheep
I met the tribe, but kept the
horse at a fast canter till I
was well past them, for, to be
honest, I was a bit windy of
those spears and boomerangs.
Then I met the women again.
One was carrying a bundle in
her arms, and two were sup-
porting the fourth. The woman
with the bundle pulled me up
and showed me the baby.
Ever since I looked on that
tiny, wrinkled, black face I
have had a soft spot for the
aboriginal people.
It was probably the first time
in my life that I had done any
serious thinking. The four
of them were all smiles, and the
mother said in very good Eng-
lish, “Isn’t he a little beauty?”
I agreed that he was a lovely
baby, and they all laughed and
fondled him the same way
as white mothers would do.
I remembered that I had
taken some meat and damper
with me in case I had not been
invited to lunch at Merah, so
I offered it to them. They
accepted with thanks, and ate
hungrily.
I rode on then, but it was
a long time before I could
think of that baby without
feeling a touch of anger at
the way we have treated the
real owners of Australia. A
mother on the track an hour
after her child was born, and
hundreds of miles in front of
her. And that babe! I
wondered what sort of life was
in front of him?
'T'wo days later we came to
Burren Junction, where the
railways split, one going to
Walgett the other to Colla-
renebri. The earthworks were
completed to both towns, but
the rails ended at Burren. Both
lines were working before the
end of the year.
We were on the flat country
properly now, and for the first
time we were out of sight of
any mountains. The timber
was' different —coolibah, pine,
myall, yarran and wilga.
Rabbits were thick, and would
spread out in front of the sheep,
then fall back as they passed.
Kangaroos and emus were in
mobs, and every creek, lagoon
or tank had mighty flocks of
every kind of waterfowl.
Ducks, ibis, swans and pelicans
abounded.
We turned north at Burren
and went through Rowena s and
Merriwinebone. This place is
famous as the only shed where
Chinese shearers were used in
an effort to break the shearers’
strike. They were not a
success, and were never tried
again. “B anj o” Paterson
gives the location as being on
the Marthaguy, which is 200
miles west of Merriwinebone.
I knew many shearers who
were in all the strikes from
’9l to ’O2, and they all say
“Banjo” was wrong. But
Merriwinebone does not rhyme
too well with any word, and
“Banjo” can be forgiven for
taking a bit of poetic licence
in a very popular song.
Through Pokataroo, and
across the Barwon at Colla-
renebri. Then down the river
to Nardoo, where we delivered
our mob. It had been a good
trip, fine weather right through,
and we had covered 120 miles
in 21 days, which was a little
under the six miles a day laid
down by the rules of the stock-
routes.
There had been good sheep-
feed all along the route, nice,
short picking which sheep
prefer, so they were in good
condition. Our horses were in
good order, as there was always
good feed in the paddocks
alongside the route. It was a
simple matter to undo the top
wire, throw a bag over the
next one, and, being old cam-
paigners, they would step over
quite unconcernedly. This was
known as “grass duffing,” and
probably most of the squatters
turned a blind eye to it so long
as the wires were tightened-up
again. There were narks, of
course, but the drovers knew
them all and would take greater


precautions when “duffing a
bit of grass.”
Nardoo was owned by Dr.
Richard Binnie, a doctor from
Macquarie Street. A very
friendly man, he said he
intended to retire and put in
the rest of his life on the land.
He had a manager on the
place, whose name I cannot
recall, who was the best hand
at counting sheep 1 have ever
known.
At Narrabri the sheep had
been counted through a race,
a slow and tedious job, but
as only one at a time could go
through there was no possi-
bility of a mistake. Three men
had counted, and on comparing
tallies all three made it 7315.
The Nardoo manager counted
them through a gate 10ft. wide.
I took the tally. Every time
he called “Hundred” I cut a
notch in a stick. He counted
through, then ran them back
and counted again, and got
the same result. When it was
added-up we were 27 short.
Counting those we had used
for rations, and the few that
died on the road, we finished-
up with three we couldn’t
account for. This was satisfac-
tory to everyone, and we were
paid-off. And so ended our
droving-trip.
T IGHTNING RIDGE Opal-field
■*-' had just opened-up, so we
went out to have a look at it.
We had never seen any mining
before, and found it very
interesting. Black opal is very
beautiful. I saw a slab as big
as my hand. It was a mass
of color black, red, blue,
green and yellow, and to me
it seemed to be alive. There
were many smaller pieces, and
all of them were very beautiful.
I believe that apart from
Lightning Ridge black opal
is found only in Austria. While
I was at the Ridge the miners
were expecting a group of
Austrian buyers, to get an idea
of the true value of their opal.
The local buyers were offering
ridiculously low prices, on the
plea that opal was unlucky
and would never become
popular.
All the ground was pegged-
out, and none of the diggers
wanted partners, so we left
after a few days and made
back to the Barwon at
Walgett.
This town is noted for the
absence of stones, as “Banjo”
mentions: “A small place on
the Namoi, five miles above
the junction with the Barwon,
it had nothing to break the
monotony of the black soil.”
A few hours there was enough.
so we made back to the
Barwon.
E. Rich and Co., forwarding-
agents, had a big shed for the
storage of wool, and the chap
in charge said he was expect-
ing two steamers from Bre-
warrina to load wool, and
offered us the job of loading
the barges.
That afternoon we had our
first sight of the river-boats—
the Wandering Jew and the
Cato. They were small boats
to what I had been expecting to
“We had our first sight of the river-boats."
see: about 30ft. long, flat-
bottomed, and with a single
paddle-wheel at the stern.
Each had a long, narrow barge,
which was pushed in front
of the vessels.
Captain White owned and
skippered both boats. The crew
was made up of an engineer
and deckhand on each. The
deckhand was usually a swag-
man getting a lift between
towns. The engineer was
navigator, pilot, stoker and
woodcutter, or any job that
might turn-up. I think the
“Captain” was purely a
courtesy title. He had been on
the inland rivers nearly all his
life, and knew them all very
well. He had made a good
living on the rivers, and owned
several boats besides the Cato
and the Jew.
I wondered how he chose
the name Wandering Jew for
a boat that had never been on
salt-water, so he told me the
story of going down from
Walgett, some years previously,
during a flood, and, mistaking
a billabong for the main
stream, found himself stranded
10 miles from the Barwon.
When the flood went down, his
load was shifted by teams, but
the boat was high and dry for
two years, until another flood
came, and he was able to bring
her back to the river.
YJL7 E had the barges loaded
and tied-down at sundown
the next day, then put in
another day cutting and load-
ing wood for the boilers
Captain White had offered us
a lift to Brewarrina, which
we eagerly accepted. Inci-
dentally, this was the last trip
of the river-boats to Walgett.
The line from Narrabri was
completed before the end of
the year, and it was cheaper
to send wool direct to Sydney
by rail. The boats ran to
Bourke from Wentworth for
many years after, but stopped
finally in the late ’twenties.
It was an interesting trip. I
was amazed at the way the
boats were steered over sand-
bars and around snags, but the
captain never seemed to hesi-
tate. Just when I thought we
must hit a huge log he would
swing the wheel, and the Jew
would clear the danger with
inches to spare. The river was
low, and often we would travel
a mile or more with the paddle-
wheel throwing up mud and
sand behind us.
There was always a huge
flock of birds preceding us;
ducks, cranes, pelicans, ibis,
galahs, cockatoos, and many
others whose names I didn’t
know, stirred-up by the
chugging of the engine and the
smoke pouring from the funnel.
Sometimes, when they realised
they were being driven too
far from their own territory,
they would split, and come
tearing back, wings whistling,
and the parrots screaming
indignantly. Another group
w'ould form-up immediately, so
we were never without a van-
guard.
We tied-up at night, as it was
too risky to travel while the
river was so low. The second
night of the “voyage” we
reached Boorooma, about half-
way down, and went “ashore.”
The arrival of the boats was
always an event that was
looked forward to as a chance
to- swap news, and yarn with
people from outside their own
little world. There were few
telephones at that time, and
the mail ran from Brewarrina
only once a week.
'The overseer offered us a job
helping to class the sheep
in readiness for the shearing,
so we left the Jew.
We had a week on the class-
ing. The classer sat on a box,
and we had to drag each sheep
up to him : he would open the
wool on the shoulder, and
point to the chute which that
particular sheep had to go
down. Dutchy and I fell for
this job, which was the only
hard work in the whole process.
We had asked for and got
eight-bob a day and tucker,
but we earned it. There were
somewhere over 100,000 sheep
on Boorooma, but only about
20,000 had to be classed
(which is still a lot of sheep).
It took seven days to get
through them, and neither of us
was sorry.
We camped near a boundary-
rider's hut on the way to
Brewarrina, and he invited us
to come over and have a
yarn. 1 think the hospitality
of the outback people owes a
lot to their isolation. Most
of them would be in the same
place for six months or more,
seeing and talking to the same
people, with nothing to talk
about but sheep, so fresh faces
were always welcome. It was
harder on the women, the wives
of the boundary-riders, on the
big stations, such as Boorooma.
The men would have someone
to see and talk to every day,
but the women would not see
one of their own sex for
months on end. And their
living-conditions were close to
primitive.
This place was a four-roomed

Where There's Smoke There Shouldn't Be
Time Tor Clean Air
Although the smoke nuisance in
Australian cities has never reached
the proportions recorded in the
worst parts of London and the
English Midlands, anyone who has ever
lived or worked near a power-station,
steelworks, brickyards, gasworks or a
large industrial plant can testify that it
is by no means negligible.
In the United Kingdom the Clean Air
Act came into force last June. Under its
provisions fines up to £lOO may be
inflicted for pollution of the air by
“dark” smoke.
No Clean Air Act has yet been passed
in any Australian State, but the first
steps towards such a move have been
taken in N.S.W. Over three years ago
a Smoke Abatement Committee was
appointed to investigate and report on
the causes, extent and effect of air-
pollution ; to consider the existing pro-
visions of the law affecting it and to
recommend further preventive measures
thought necessary. The committee was
a large one ; under the chairmanship of
J. T. Monaghan, of the Local Govern-
ment Department, it included Professor
Baxter, Vice-Chancellor of the N.S.W.
University ; Professor T. G. Hunter,
Professor of Chemical Engineering at
Sydney University ; fuel experts from
C.5.1.R.0., the gas industry, electricity
authorities and the coal industry ;
health-officers and representatives of
industry and local-government.
The committee made its report several
months ago. So far there has been no
move to implement its recommendations,
which included one for the passing of
a Clean Air Act on the lines of the
British Act but in a simpler form which
would cover all forms of air-pollution—
in England three Acts are required. So
far nothing has been done, and as there
will be only a short session before the
State election, it is unlikely that anything
will be done by the present Parliament.
An Old Problem
A ction against smoke nuisance is
nothing new, though effectual action
might be. The first mention of the
subject in English history is a Royal
proclamation of 1306 forbidding the use
of coal in London and laying down
penalties for infringements: “for the first
offence with great fines and ransom and
upon the second offence to destroy their
furnaces.” J. L. Sullivan, of the N.S.W.
Health Department’s industrial-hygiene
division, who carried out a survey for
the Smoke Abatement Committee, claims
that the penalties went even further and
that in at least one case the offender him-
self was destroyed.
At that early period the smoke would
have come mainly from domestic chim-
neys and blacksmiths’ forges ; it was not
until the 19th century, when the Age of
Steam was approaching its peak, that
people began to be really concerned at
the damage done to health and property
by the fumes from tens of thousands of
factory-chimneys. A Parliamentary
Select Committee was set-up in 1819 to
inquire into the problem, and later com-
mittees, in 1843 and 1845, made recom-
mendations as a result of which a bill
was passed requiring factory-furnaces
“to consume their own smoke.” This
picturesque phrase sounded all right, but
the legislation was qualified by the words
“as far as practicable.” Further, the Act
didn’t apply to mines, smelting or the
steel industry, and it left another loop-
hole by specifically confining its appli-
cation to black smoke. An amendment
to the Public Health Act in 1926 tidied
this up a little* but apparently without
much effect. It took the “Great Smog”
of 1952 to punch home the necessity for
drastic action.
The Beaver Committee
A Committee on Air Pollution was
appointed in July, 1953, to report on
the connection, if any, between the
severe smoke and fog conditions
experienced in London from December
5-9, 1952, and the high number of deaths
recorded in the week eqded December
13, 1952—4703 compared with 1852 in
the corresponding week of 1951.
The committee reported that the causes
of air-pollution were “smoke, gases, grit,
dust from domestic and industrial chim-
neys, locomotives and ships, exhaust-
gases from motor-vehicles, and the solid
and gaseous pollutants from chemical-
works and industrial processes.” Of
these the most important were “visible
pollution by smoke, grit and dust.”
The report estimated that the annual
cost to the British economy was £250
million, and the annual waste of coal
10-million tons. “The cost of curing it
would be only a fraction of the resultant
savings. The case for preventive action
is overwhelming.” The committee con-
cluded that there was a clear association
between air-pollution and the incidence
of bronchitis and other respiratory
diseases. The bronchitis deathrate was
found to be much higher in England and
Wales than in Europe and highest in
those towns exposed to air-pollution.
N. S. Wales Survey
r T''HE Smoke Abatement Committee first
set-out to determine the nature of air-
pollution in N. S. Wales, and recourse
was taken to the surveys conducted by
the Division of Industrial Hygiene of
the Department of Public Health. These
surveys were carried out by means of
measuring-stations in the principal
industrial areas —Sydney, Newcastle and
Port Kembla. The deposit-gauges used
recorded only pollution caused by the
burning of fuels —chiefly coal —and no
survey was taken on chemical pollution
of the air from gases or vapors. But
even on the evidence of the deposit-
gauge alone the committee was satisfied
that “there is in N. S. Wales a significant
pollution-problem which is no less than
that of most overseas cities and that
this pollution is almost entirely derived
from, industry and public utilities and is
responsible for considerable property
damage.
In the Sydney area the chief culprits
were found to be
general industry, particularly in the opera-
tion of steam-boilers; brickworks which,
by reason of their close proximity to
closely settled residential areas, are the
cause of much complaint; engineering
industries, particularly foundries; public-
utilities including powerhouses, gasworks,
railways; and ferries and cargo vessels
on Sydney Harbor.
Of public utilities, the report said the
five large powerhouses in the metropoli-
tan area were heavy contributors.
Although they all had some form of
dust-collection system, “there is no lack
of visual evidence of an ample dust-
and grit-fall from them all.” That seems
to be a careful understatement.
Railway workshops, particularly those
at Redfern, earned special mention. “As
they discharge mostly at low level, there
are few sources in the Sydney area that
are as bad.” Gasworks were given a
fairly clean- bill as far as smoke is con-
cerned, but could be classed as “odor
nuisances” (extent unmeasured).
At Newcastle and Port Kemble the
steelworks, powerhouses, brickworks,
railways and shipping are the chief
Sources of pollution. It is expected that
the degree of pollution at Port Kembla
will increase because of the city’s rapid
industrial development ; at the same time
its effect will be felt more because of the
erection of houses in areas subject to
heavy pollution fall-out.
It is rather alarming to read that the
estimated monthly fall-out of 20-25 tons
of deposited matter per square-mile in
London “is closely comparable with that
of Sydney.” Admittedly the fog-condi-
tions which multiply the menace of Lon-
don smoke are not present in Sydney,
and the committee doesn’t envisage any
acute health effects from pollution. At
the same time the nuisance and irritant
effect of the smoke-pall is undoubted,
and the economic loss it causes is also
beyond dispute.
The Beaver Committee in Britain
declared that air-pollution was a social
and economic evil that should be com-
bated “with the same conviction and
energy as were applied 100 years ago in
securing pure water.” The objective
aimed at in the U.K. Clean Air Act is
to reduce the contamination in heavily
populated areas by about 80 per cent,
within 10 to 15 years. It is surely not
asking too much of the N. S. Wales and
other State Governments to suggest that
they set themselves a similar objective.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Sydney Horses
Feature of racing at Canter-
bury Park last Saturday was a
stylish performance by Caesar
in the Flying Handicap, which
was run in close to record time,
and at an unsuitable distance
(six furlongs) for this member
of T. J. Smith’s Randwick
team. Caesar was reappearing
after competing at the Mel-
bourne Cup meeting, at which
he won at 13 furlongs, and two
days later finished second at
H mile. Freshened after a
brief rest, he came from the
rear of the field for his third
at Canterbury to the speedy
Cornelius and Mighty King-
dom (who performed well for
a 100-to-l shot). Caesar imme-
diately sharpened in betting for
the Villiers, and he could be
a worthy rival for Amneris,
winner of her only two races
since a spell of 12 months.
Amneris won at Warwick
Farm and at Rosehill; she has
since pleased in her training,
and seems bound to do well in
the Villiers. A smart beginner,
she should be in the front lot
from the start. On the other
hand, both Caesar and
Grenoble are slow beginners,
but each can unwind a power-
ful finishing run.
Grenoble’s display in the
Flying at Canterbury Park,
following his near-record track-
gallop at Rosebery, surprised
connections, but Canterbury is
a saucer-track, and not all
horses handle it well. It is on
the cards that Grenoble, a
class miler, will do a lot better
at Randwick next Saturday.
However, Amneris has the best-
form of the fancied horses for
the Villiers, and looks the
winner. Caesar and Grenoble
may be next-best. The only
others likely to offer keen
opposition to the better-
fancied horses are Huntly and
Theodric.
Leo O’Sullivan has taken-
over a lease of New Spec until
September, 1960, by which
time the Newtown Wonder
gelding will be a seven-year-
old. New Spec could soon
land a race for his trainer, as
he will benefit from the Canter-
bury run in the Flying Handi-
cap, his first start since last
May. Carrying O’Sullivan’s
colors on Saturday for the first
time, he made the pace till the
final stages, when his condition
petered out and he dropped
back, to be 12th (16 starters)
at the finish. Last December
he won Tattersall’s Carring-
ton Stakes, and he is among
the 33 nominations for next
Saturday week's race.
Ringleader, winner of the
Canterbury Two - year - old
Handicap (contested by non-
winners), opened his account
in promising style, putting in
a fast finish over the last
100yds. to gain victory on the
post. He is by Damtar (Fr.)
from Bonnet Box (imp.) by
Torbido, and was one of the
cheap lots at the Randwick
yearling-sales last Easter, realis-
ing 170gns. A half-brother to
Nilish, a recent winner of the
Q.T.C. McDougall Stakes, he
is a good-looking colt trained
by L. Walton for A. Gray.
It was good to see veteran
trainer Neil McKenna, a
popular figure among Turf
men, as winning mentor of the
well-fancied Count Charles in
the Campsie Stakes. Neil—at
84! —is a particularly active
trainer, and has had a long
association with E. K. White,
owner of the winner. Thirty
years ago E.K. won the Sydney
Cup with Winalot. Count
Charles, who had finished
second to Marksman at War-
wick Farm, beat one of the
best fields for this type of
race in weeks. Before start-
ing his long career as a
trainer McKenna was a jockey,
and had some good wins. He’s
been training 67 years, the last
50 of them in Sydney.
Several emergency starters
are, of course, included to take
the places of horses scratched
from limit fields in some events,
and many of them prove
winners or minor placegetters.
At Canterbury Idyllic (second
emergency) won the Welter, and
Forest Music (first emergency)
ran third in the Two-year-old
Handicap—she should have
won. In Melbourne emergency
horses are not given a barrier-
number. They take the posi-
tion in order of horses with-
drawn after acceptance, a
scheme which Sydney clubs
should adopt. It would save
time at acceptance-hour.
••• - •
Races from the 74-furlongs
chute at Canterbury are often
roughly run, and the Welter,
won by outsider Idyllic, was
no exception to the general
order from this difficult barrier.
A number of better-fancied
horses had their prospects
ruined soon after the start,
which the rider of the winner
avoided by getting clear once
the field settled-down. New
Gem, Coronado, Belarco and
runner-up Te Rangi were all
hampered during the running,
and the last-named did well to
finish in the money. Maybe
the club could extend the
distance by removing some
buildings, or it could reduce the
size of the fields to 15 starters.

Flemington
Since he began his career
in New Zealand Baron Boissier,
now an eight-year-old gelding,
has had no fewer than 91
starts. Like many stayers, he
was not of much account until
his fifth year, when he de-
veloped into a really good-
class performer. His record
includes a Hotham Handicap
and an Alister Clark Stakes, so
it was not surprising that, even
with 9.2 on a heavy track, he
proved too good for the
moderate lot opposed to him
in the 13-furlongs Benevolent
Fund Handicap at Flemington
last Saturday.
• • • •
“The Baron,” who is owned
in New Zealand by E. C. Dunn,
will go now to South Aus-
tralia for the rich Port
Adelaide Cup on December
29. With only 8.8 he has an
excellent chance of adding
that prize to his stake-earnings,

Former jockey Jim Cerchi,
who now prepares Baron
Boissier, has not had a lot
of success as a trainer, but
last Saturday became a day
to remember when he com-
pleted a double at head-
quarters with the nine-year-
old Coppice. Cerchi has 14
children, and on Saturday he

chuckled with anticipation of
the Christmas he would give
them this year.
In his day Coppice was a
topliner, and in W. R. Kem-
ball’s ownership won the
Memsie Stakes twice, defeat-
ing Rising Fast when that
champion was at his best. Now
owned by R. G. McNicol,
Coppice had not shown win-
ning form for a long time. He
was well handled, in the mile
Kingsville Handicap by young
apprentice J. Salisbury, who
had won earlier in the day on
Regal Wench.
An extraordinary sidelight
of Melbourne racing in recent
months has been the failure of
Brian Smith to ride a Hurdle
winner. Smith, the best cross-
country hoop in Australia in
post-war years, has not won
a Hurdle in the city for six
months. His mounts are still
strongly supported, and again
at Flemington his name as
rider made Eager Lad a warm
favorite, but that gelding
finished well down the track.
The 80-to-l chance Strong
Guy, new to hurdling, showed
promise by winning in a
canter. Only a four-year-old,
Strong Guy was hopeless on
the flat, but he may have a
future in the jumping business.
Best performance seen at
Flemington on Saturday was
Planetoid’s first-up win in the
six-furlongs Benefit Handicap.
For all his class, nobody
seemed to -think Planetoid
could carry 9.13 —second top-
weight was 8.1 —on the heavy
track, and the Empyrean geld-
ing drifted from evens to
fours. In the run, Planetoid
led from go to whoa, and
could have improved on his
two-lengths win. He will get
plenty of weight in sprint races
over the holiday season, but he
is so very good that he will
play an important part in races
like the Christmas Handicap
at Caulfield on Boxing Day
and the Standish Handicap at
Flemington on New Year’s
Day.
Winner of the five-furlongs
Maroondah Handicap for two-
year-olds, New San showed
vast improvement on his pre-
vious form. In three starts the
Sans Tache-Philomela colt had
not finished close to the place-
getters, but apparently he likes
the sting out of the track. He
"Got an A.P.C.? I think I'm going down
with something.”
finished with great dash to run
past the favorite, Favoured
Beau, close to home. New San
was ridden by fifteen-year-old
Stan Lanyon, who was per-
suaded to give-up his job as
a city newsboy by lan O’Neill,
part-owner of New San. The
lad goes to scale at 6.7, and in
his brief career has ridden
three city winners. Vin
O’Neill, father of lan, trains
New San, who races in the
famous black and white
diamonds carried by Spearfelt,
trained by O’Neill for his 1926
Melbourne Cup win. That
Cup is remembered for the fact
that a still-record crowd of
126,000 saw the race.
An interesting winner at
Flemington was the four-year-
old chestnut entire Pending,
who has won any number of
races around the Victorian and
South Australian country
tracks. At his previous start
he lumped 11.2 in a very minor
event at Healesville, ridden by
his part-owner, amateur rider
R. Carlson. It’s not surprising
that he has won so many, small
events —he showed real ability
to take the second Buxton
Trial by five lengths. His time
for the class and conditions—
2.64—was good, and some-
thing better than a Trial is
likely to come his way.

The Trots
At Harold Park last Friday
night brilliant Bathurst pacer
First Kiss won the Harold
Park Handicap (13 furlongs,
98yds.) in the record time of
3min. 35fsec., breaking the
record jointly held by Sir
Raider and Noble Western by
4jsec.
Starting favorite at 7 to 4
on from the 12yds. mark,
First Kiss was seventh in a
strung-out field passing the
winning-post the first time.
Within another lap he had
joined the pacemaker, Banga-
roo Lass, and held that posi-
tion until half a lap from the
finish. He then dashed clear
and was untroubled to win by
a length from Main Power and
Field Dixie.
• • • •
First Kiss has now won
nine races out of his last 10
starts. One more win will
make him eligible for the
rich £6OOO Harold Park Cup,
to be run on January 23.
The Randwick Handicap
produced a thrilling finish,
four horses going over the line
together. Favorite Van Ray
led throughout, with West-
grove Boy trailing him for
most of . the journey. Van
Ray got the verdict by a half-
head, with the fast-finishing
Lucky Jim failing by a half-
head to beat Westgrove Boy
for the second possie. Shining
Silk missed a place by a nose.

Firsf Cricket Test
As was evident enough after
the first two days of negative
play, the opening Test of the
present series, staged in Bris-
bane, was duly, painfully, lost.
England was the one that lost
it, but it could have been either
of them after the first dull
couple of days. The story of
the rest was simply that Eng-
land continued negative-p/ws
in its second-innings, and Aus-
tralia didn’t. Assuming that
the England chaps now realise
that as well as anybody, present
commentator will continue
putting his spare coin on the
horses as safer than , backing
either side for the rest of the
series.
One thing Trevor Bailey’s
long, wearisome second-innings
knock o.f 68 in over 74- hours
proved is that such an innings
is of little avail if his partners
are not making runs. The
stonewaller who’s “holding the
side together” may be doing a
useful job if others are scoring
freely ; as in the case of Burke’s
28 not-out of Australia’s Test-
winning second-innings 2-147.
At least his partners, O’Neill
in particular, made runs.
The title of “slowest and
dreariest Test ever” was given
to the third Test between Aus-
tralia and South Africa last
season; when, in particular,
South African opener McGlew
glued himself to the crease for
9} hours for 105. S’Africa had
dismissed Australia for 163,
but took so long about scoring
its 384 that Australia was
enabled to make a draw of it.
In fact, if the 1957-58 Testsi
in South Africa proved any-
thing they proved that slow
and dreary batting not only
does not win Tests—it can
help to lose them.
• • • • %
Certainly it contributed
largely to England’s loss in
the first Test in Brisbane, a
Test which staked a fair claim
also for “slowest and dreariest”!
award. It must be admitted
that, both in the Tests in South
Africa and in this Brisbane
Test, Australia’s batting often
has a snail-paced quality, too;
but generally there seems more
reason about its slowness.
There was absolutely no reason

at all about England’s second-
innings failure to try to put
some runs on the board, when
it needed some runs to spare if
its bowlers were to win the
Test. Its before-lunch per-
formance in that innings
plumbed the deepest depths of
dullness.
For the record, the scores in
brief: England 134 (Meckiff
3-33, Davidson 3-36, Benaud
3-46) and 198 (Bailey 68,
Graveney 36 ; Benaud 4-66);
Australia 186 (McDonald
42, O’Neill 34; Loader 4-56,
Bailey 3-35) and 2-147 (O’Neill
71 not-out).
Some of the game’s features
—O’Neill’s auspicious start in
Test-cricket, particularly in his
grand second-innings 71 not-
out ; Benaud’s great • bowling
and generally sound captaincy ;
the controversial catch by
Kline to dismiss Cowdrey in the
second innings; Graveney’s
bad luck in being run-out in
the second innings when look-
ing set for a big score —and his
remarkable slip-catch to get
rid of O’Neill in the first
innings ; May’s double failure
—repetition not a thing to punt
on in coming Tests; good
bowling by speedsters Loader,*
Bailey and Statham (who
looked the best of the three,
though least successful), for
England, and by Davidson and
Meckiff, for Australia—though
Meckiff was erratic, in all
faith ; and a good first-innings
start (55) by Australia’s Mc-
Donald and Burke, while
England openers Milton and
Richardson failed twice.
••• • •
England’s first-innings 134
was its lowest total against
Australia since its second-
innings 123 in the third 1950-51
Test in Sydney. Its previous
lowest first-innings total was its
52 at the Oval in the fifth 1948
Test (when Hutton batted
nearly through the innings for
30 and Lindwall took 6-20).
For its previous-lowest first-
innings total in Australia, one
must go back to its 61 (Cotter
6-40, Noble 4-19) in Melbourne
in the fifth Test in 1903-04.
There was, however, one
other England first-innings
since then which could
probably have fallen short of
the 134—the 7-68, closed, on a
rain-affected wicket in the first
1950-51 Test in Brisbane. (In
this game, Australia, batting
first on a good wicket, made
228 ; England, closed at 7-68 ;
Australia, batting again, closed
at 7-32, after losing its first
three wickets Morris,
Moroney and Loxton —without
a run on the board ; England,
set 193 to win, all out 122,
of which Hutton, batting from
third-wicket down, made 62
not-out.)
Two of the four bowlers still
living to have taken a hat-trick
in a Test both played in
Brisbane. England’s Peter
Loader got his in the fourth
Test between England and the
West Indies at Leeds in 1957,
while Lindsay Kline took his
three wickets in three balls to
finish-off South Africa’s second
innings in the second Test at
Pretoria last season. Kline did
not take a wicket in Brisbane,
but held two good diving
catches at leg (the second one
considered doubtful by some)
to dismiss Cowdrey twice, both
times off Meckiff. (The other
two living takers of a Test hat-
trick are Allom —for England
v. N.Z. at Christchurch in
1929-30 and Goddard for
England v. South Africa at
Johannesburg in 1938-39.

Victorian Tennis
Third time didn’t prove it
for Ashley Cooper on Satur-
day, when he was thrashed by
last year’s winner, Mai Ander-
son, in straight sets, 7-5, 6-4, 6-3,
in the final of the Victorian singles-
titles; the match lasted only 68min.
In 1955 Hoad beat Cooper in the
final in a very hard five-setter, 1-6,
6-4, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, while last year
Anderson had been harder-pressed
than he was on Saturday to defeat
him 6-4, 10-8, 1-6, 7-5.
Anderson, whose form this
season has been patchy, played right
at his top. He reached the finals
of the Queensland and S.A. cham-
pionships, though defeated in each
(in Queensland, by Cooper in four
sets), but in the N.S.W. titles was
eliminated in straight sets by
18-year-old American Earl Buchholz
in an early round. Cooper played
well on Saturday, but could not
match Anderson.
In 1955 Cooper had had a hard
five-set semi-final win over Rosewall
before going down to Hoad, and
again this year he was taken to five
sets in his semi-final, by the
up-and-coming Spaniard Andres
Gimeno. Cooper had to play his
best to win, 1-6, 13-11, 11-9, 5-7,
6-3. The other semi-final was also
a hard-fought five-setter, in which
Anderson defeated left-hander
Neale Fraser 6-3, 3-6, 2-6, 11-9, 8-6
and thus ended, it would seem, any
chance Fraser had of playing singles
in the Davis Cup challenge-round.
The doubles-final, played after
the singles-finaL instead of the day
before, usual doubles-final day (play
that day being washed-out), was
won by Anderson-Laver, who
defeated Cooper-Fraser 5-7, 6-4,
9-7, 6-4. Anderson and Laver also
won this year’s Queensland and
S.A. doubles-title, while the N.S.W.
doubles went to Anderson and
Fraser (who beat Cooper and
Laver). Anderson looks certain to
be one of the Davis Cup doubles-
players, partnered by either of the
two left-handers. Fraser would be
at least as good a choice as Laver.
The women's singles-final was
won by South African Sandra
Reynolds, who was runner-up in the
Queensland singles and won the
S.A. title. She defeated in straight
sets, 6-4, 8-6, the Victorian Lor-
raine Coghlan, who lost last year’s
Victorian final to another
“foreigner,” English lass Angela
Mortimer. The women’s doubles-
final was won b'y Mrs. Long and
Mrs. Hawton, who beat the two
South Africans, Reynolds and
Schuurman.


UNCABLED
ADDITION
BERLIN
T>ress - comment on the
Russian proposal to hand
East Berlin over to the East
German Government:
“Manchester Guardian” :
“The point of Mr. Khrush-
chev’s new exercise is, of
course, to get the Western
Powers out of West Berlin. He
seems to think that insuperable
difficulties might be created for
the West if East German
officials replace the Russians
at the control-points, but it is
hard to see why this should
be much of ah obstacle.
Western representatives could
accept the East Germans as
agents designated by the
Russians to carry out Russian
responsibilities. No recognition
of the East German regime
would be involved.”
The same: “The Russians
and their East German agents
may try to think up new
obstructions, but they must
have realised by now that there
is no peaceful way of getting
the Western Powers to abandon
either their principles or their
friends in Berlin.”
* * *
New York “Herald Tribune”:
“The Soviet Union is not,
despite the words of its
Ambassador, going to ‘give
Berlin to the Germans.’ It
plans to give it to its own
stooges, men detested by the
people they rule, kept in
power only by Soviet tanks.
The West Berliners know that,
and will have none of it. ‘Free
Berlin,’ said Mayor Willy
Brandt, ‘belongs to the free
West.’ So long as there is a
fraudulent East German
Government spearheading the
Soviet threat to free Berlin,
that Government will neither
be recognised nor will its
ukases be obeyed by the West.
The Allies are in Berlin as a
matter of right; they will stay
there as a matter of conscience
and to safeguard the freedom
of all free Europe.”
* * *
London “Economist” : “The
Western Powers cannot give
up Berlin, except as part of
a settlement that reunites
Germany and thus restores the
city to its position as Germany’s
capital. Until then, its liberty
is a pledge of the Western
Powers’ resolution to stand by
their friends. What is wrong
is to suppose that, because it
would be embarrassing to have
to deal with German Com-
munists in place of Russian
Communists, the Russians are
necessary in Berlin and the
Western interest requires them
to stay. This puts the form
before the substance; and it
puts the West in a silly posi-
tion.”
* * *
“Yorkshire Post” : “From
Lebanon and Jordan to
Formosa and now back to
Berlin: the zigzag pattern of
Communist pressure is gradu-
ally becoming familiar. The
world is growing accustomed
even as each new artificial
crisis arises in its turn, to look
beyond it to the next likely
choice for tension. Each crisis,
however artificially and
deliberately it may have been
fomented, is genuine enough at
the time. Mr. Khrushchev and
Mr. Mao Tse-tung can never
be quite certain that things
will go the way they intend,
that all the minor actors in
each drama will keep their
heads and not make an irre-
vocable move that will start a
general war ; and neither can
we.
“It is the greatest indictment
of the Communists that they
adopt this policy of playing
with fire ; so much so that one
may regard with irony their
accusation against Mr. Dulles
of continual ‘brinkmanship.’
We therefore are forced to
treat each crisis seriously. Yet
a certain kind of inverted
cynicism is growing. As each
crisis is more-or-less smoothed
over in one way or another,
people say ‘Where next?’ and
tend to discount the real exist-
ing danger. That attitude itself
adds to the danger, but it also
is an indication that the Com-
munists’ policy is losing its
usefulness to them. Demo-
cratic nations react each time
more and more coolly, with less
hastiness, even though with
greater speed. We are getting

our breath back, we are better
placed for the parry.”
♦ * *
London “Daily Mail”:
“The best thing, is to ask the
West Berliners if they would
feel more free in a ‘free city’
surrounded by Russian satel-
lites than with Allied garrisons
in their midst.”
» * *
London “Time and Tide”:
“It is important that we in the
West should be perfectly clear
in our own minds about the
rights and wrongs of the situa-
tion in Berlin. In June, 1945,
Great Britain, the United
States, France and the Soviet
Union signed a declaration which
entitled them to station troops
and civil authorities in ‘any or
all parts of Germany as they
may determine.’ This declara-
tion was signed two months
before the signature of the
Potsdam Agreement, which
bears no relation to the state
of affairs in Berlin, pace Mr.
Khrushchev’s statement of
November 10. The Soviet
Government is as much bound
by this declaration as are the
Western Powers, and Russia
cannot legally withdraw from
her responsibilities under it
without consulting the other
Powers concerned, nor may she
delegate her obligations to the
East German authorities or
anyone else without the
approval of the other signa-
lories.
It is certain that the Rus-
sians will seek to confuse
Western thinking in general
and West German thinking in
particular. The two-million
inhabitants of West Berlin have
seen the Russians at close
quarters, and nothing, neither
threats nor cajolery, will shake
their abhorrence of Corn-
munism. In the Federal Repub-
lie it is otherwise. Most people
there have never seen a Rus-
sian, and Berliners have never
been popular with other Ger-
mans. Quite recently the
Minister-President of Bavaria
felt it necessary to declare in
a broadcast that ‘the time is
past when we Bavarians cursed
the Prussians . . . Berliners are
really splendid people.’
“This statement is prema-
ture. A great many Bavarians,
not to mention Germans from
other provinces, do still curse
the Berliners and have for
years mentally written-off their
former capital. If the Russians
and the East German leaders
can persuade a large section
of opinion in the Federal
Republic that the situation in
Berlin is the principal
stumbling-block to the re-
unification of Germany, the
resulting pressure on Dr.
Adenauer's Government might
be difficult to resist.
“No doubt the Federal in-
formation services and the
West German press will make
it clear that the determination
of the Western allies to main-
tain their forces in Berlin and
to resist by all appropriate
means any attempt to alter the
status of the city by unilateral

Stories of the Coastal Lights No. 25
' "aHMiiinßMiW'
Breaksea Island
The lighthouse on little Breaksea Island, in the entrance to
King George Sound and about 10 miles from Albany, is one
of the highest on the Western Australian coast. Although the
stone tower is only 34 ft. tall, the focal plane of the light is
390 ft. above high water, and because of this elevation the
light can be seen for 25 miles in clear weather.
Two lighthouses have been built on Breaksea Island,
which is about 14 miles long and a quarter of a mile wide.
The first was an octagonal iron tower 43 ft. high. It was
erected by Royal Engineers, all materials being sent from
Britain, and came into use in 1858. The present masonry
tower was built in 1901 together with quarters for three light-
keepers, the old tower being demolished soon after the new
light came into service.
The original light had a strength of only 2,000 candle-
power. This was increased to 24,000 candlepower in 1901,
but because a manned lighthouse was established on Eclipse
Island (about 11 miles south-west of Breaksea Island) in
1926, the strength of the Breaksea light was reduced to
10,000 candlepower and the keepers were withdrawn. Up to
1920 the light was of a "fixed” type, but it is now automatically
operated and is "group flashing.”
The position of the Breaksea Island light is latitude
35° 04' south, longitude 118° 04' east.

U.K. Election Comment
T>ritish press post-mortems
on the result of the Aus-
tralian elections.
London “Financial Times”:
“Essentially the battle was a
personal one, and it is fair to
say that Dr. Evatt lost it rather
than that Mr. Menzies won.
Ever since the Petrov case and
the Labor-party split on issues
arising out of the Catholic-
inspired fight against Commu-
nist domination in the trade-
unions, many Australians have
rightly or wrongly suspected
that Dr. Evatt was ‘soft’ on
Communists. Personal factors
apart, the vote was also a re-
jection of Socialism in any
shape or form, even though
the Labor proposals contained
no Socialist features. In a
country as prosperous as Aus-
tralia such a rejection is hardly
surprising.”
* * $
Edinburgh “ Scotsman ”:
“Labor seems to have no one
The Bulletin, December 17, 1958
to match Mr. Menzies in
prestige.”
* * *
London “Time and Tide”:
“For Dr. Evatt this election
could be the most critical of
his career. In charge of a
party which has been in a
state of steady decline since
its attempt at bank-nationalisa-
tion in 1948, he has been the
centre of violent controversy
within the Labor movement.
He is a resourceful fighter, but
it seems doubtful whether he
will get the chance to lead the
Labor party into another elec-
tion campaign.”
* * *
London “Economist”: “It is
now less possible than ever it
was that the [Labor] dissidents
will be united under his [Evatt’s]
leadership ; he would be lead-
ing them towards another cer-
tain defeat. In face of that
prospect a further split in the
Labor party some time in the
next three years seems likely,
and the Democratic Labor
party may yet realise its ambi-
tion of forming the nucleus of
a party slightly to the left of
centre. In a nation of
property-owners, well paid and
thoroughly bourgeois, that is
the sort of party that could
eventually sweep Mr. Menzies
from power.”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph”:
“During the election campaign.
Dr. Evatt and his friends were
careful not to lay any stress
on Socialism and nationalisa-
tion. Instead, they produced
a flamboyant programme of in-
creased benefits under the
social services, especially for
children, old-age pensioners,
and those about to be married.
It was an invitation to families
and individuals to opt for more
money to spend.
“There are some striking par-
allels here. Our own [Britain’s]
Socialists seem to be equally
despairing of Socialism. True,
the party is committed to the
re-nationalisation of steel and
of road-transport, but it counts
these as embarrassments rather
than lures. There is to be a
paradise, of course, but it will
not be that of nationalisation.
Instead, the social services are
,to provide fruits ever richer
and more varied —without, so
far as one can see, the labor
of man. It is the same turn,
in the same direction, as that
made by the Socialists of Aus-
tralia.
“This is, in fact, the twilight
of Socialism, as it has been
understood and practised in
free countries by those who
preferred to stop short of
Marxist Communism. Both the
British and Australian parties
were inspired by the same prin-
ciples. The principles have
been tried, have failed, and
have had to be rejected. Now
the inspiration has departed

London “Daily Mail”: “Just
after the war it seemed that
the world was going Socialist
or Communist. With Labor or
Liberal Governments in most
British countries the Common-
wealth had certainly swung
Left. That tendency has long
since been reversed. In Britain
a seven-year Tory Government
is still highly popular. In
Canada the Conservative party
last year won a landslide vic-
tory And now the Australians
have given Mr. Menzies, after
nine years in office, another
lease of political leadership.”
The U.K. Labor Party
HThe British Labor party’s
pamphlet on “The Future
Labor Offers You” —“a six-
penny guide to its own mind”
—appears to have been about
as well received by the British
press as were Australian
Labor’s election promises. The
pamphlet’s approach to the
electors, comments London
“Financial Times,” “is that
which the party’s journalists
have been elaborating for some
years past”:
“You take a ‘human’ subject
like unemployment or hospi-
tals, pick on some obvious
aspect of it which could bear
improvement, suggest casually
that all past progress has been
due to Labor, throw in an
irrelevant figure or two, blame
everything on the wickedness
of speculators and the selfish
stupidity of Tories, promise
bravely to put all to rights
with a touch of the wand, and
close with a heart-warming
appeal to idealism.
“It is an unpleasant formula.
It is no less unpleasant for
finding its latest expression in
colored printing, glossy covers,
cartoons, homy photographs,
and a careless profusion of
capitals and italics. This may
be popular journalism’s answer
to the advertising agency, but
it has embarrassingly little to

do with ‘visions of a just
society’ or with ‘mutual service
in freedom.’ This is poor
man’s glossy,
“Yet this pamphlet is also,
from a different point of view,
an excellent example of the
Labor party's fatal eagerness
to fall between two stools. The
urge to compromise is not diffi-
cult to understand. Here is a
party which professes Social-
ism but which depends on a
conservative trade-union move-
ment for financial support and
on the vote of the apathetic
man-in-the-street for its chance
of office. Its former aims have
been accomplished and it has
found nothing to replace them:
only by pretending that the old
dragons are still alive can it
stave off the charge that it is
obsolete. The radical, semi-
evangelistic support on which
the party once relied is still
present, though diminished,
but the party’s leaders are too
conscious of electoral factors
to propose the sort of policy
which might satisfy radical
opinion.”
London “Daily Telegraph's”
opinion is that “this pamphlet,
for all its protective coloring,
cannot conceal the three essen-
tial features of Mr. Gaitskell’s
programme. It is Socialist,
demanding nationalisation not
only of more industries but of
housing as well ; needless to
say no justification is advanced
for this vast extension of the
power of the State. It is out
of date, proposing a return to
the system of controls and so-
called planning which produced
financial disasters both in 1949
and in 1951. As if to empha-
sise how little the party is in
touch with modern conditions
the genius who chose the pic-
tures illustrates the heading
‘Your Job’ by a man digging
with a spade. Finally, it is
unpopular and known by its
authors to be so.
“In all this, rehashing has
made no difference to Socialist
policy. The potted version
seems to follow faithfully the
previous policy documents. In
one respect, however, there is
a significant change of em-
phasis. ‘The strength of the
£,’ said ‘Plan for Progress’ in
July this year, ‘will be the first
priority of our [Labor’s]
external economic policy.’ Yet
the present pamphlet, in
describing economic policy,
puts the end of restrictions
first, a plan for capital-invest-
ment second, and the mainten-
ance of the value of the pound
third. It is precisely because
most people abroad fear that
this is the real order of priority
in Socialist thinking—with the
pound a bad third —that its
policies are so much distrusted.
Letting this cat out of the bag
may prove the worst of the
pamphlet’s many gaffes.”
Listing some of the things
“at which the uncommitted
reader may jib,” “Manchester
Guardian” comments that “the
document starts off at once
with ‘Your Home,’ saying:
‘Whether the house you live
in is fit to be called a home
should not be decided simply
by the length of your purse
or the whim of the landlord.’
“No, indeed ; nor should
the kind of home you live in
be entirely unrelated to what
you are willing to pay for it.
To preach that a home is a
basic human right for every-
one is fair enough, but to give
the impression that costs are
immaterial is exceedingly dan-
gerous. One Glasgow, with a
minority of ratepayers heavily

“Then there is the section
on education: again, one that
very properly emphasises the
importance of giving every
child the chance of a first-rate
education. It sets first the need
to cut the size of classes to a
maximum of 30, among other
ways by new school-building ;
but it offers no choice of
priorities. It lumps primary
and secondary schools together
for this purpose, although the
resources can never stretch to
all at once. A decision to give
secondary schools priority
would have been better.
“Then, in the section on taxa-
tion, there is the one new state-
ment on Labor’s behalf: that it
would introduce a tax on
capital-gains. Again, that is
fair enough, for capital-gains
are a form of income that
could yield more revenue with-
out hurting the economy. But
Labor intends to tax only those
gains which are made on the
Stock Exchange. Why leave
out football-pools or television
winnings? The pools-winner
is no less of a gambler than the
small investor, and often gains
as much.”
French Elections
York “Herald Tribune”
note on the “notable
defeat” of Communist candi-
dates—and Soviet aims and
policies—in the French elec-
tions :
“This trend confirms what
was earlier revealed by de
Gaulle’s smashing victory in
the September referendum.
Then the defection of 20 per
cent, of the Communist votes
confirmed that many French-
men, not actually Communists,
had been voting that ticket as
a form of protest, and would
switch once, they had some-
thing affirmative to vote for.
Part of the defection resulted
also from the revulsion of
French workers at the rape of
Hungary and, more recently,
of Left-wing intellectuals at
the Pasternak affair.”
Various Voices
Patrick Maitland, M.P. :
“The Commonwealth will
fold up if it is expected to live
on pious platitudes. The day
has gone when we can simply
use the Empire to form a
glorious, peroration for our
speeches while paying no
attention to its structure and
problems. This year’s speech
from the Throne broke new
ground. For the first time it
recognised that the Common-
wealth as a grouping is more
important to us and to the
world than our relations with
foreign countries. It expressed
the faith that the Common-
wealth has a unique contribu-
tion to make to the develop-
ment of human society. That,
of course, is what we mean by
the ‘expanding Common-
wealth.’ But that slogan will
be a sounding brass and a
tinkling cymbal unless the
peoples of the Commonwealth
extort action from their
Governments to make the
slogan a reality.”

Prime Minister' Macmillan :
“Since the end of the second
war the great Powers have
ranged themselves in two
opposite camps. The struggle is
still a tense one. But at least
it has not exploded into a
world war. That is the justifi-
cation for all the effort and
expense that we and our allies
have devoted to our military
defences. It may well be true
that the danger of open aggres-
sion has diminished. This does
not mean that the military
threat has been withdrawn. It
means that it is held at bay.
If that is to continue we cannot
relax our defences, or lower-
our guard, except on equal
terms.”


The Wind at your Door
By ROBERT D. FITZGERALD
My ancestor was called on to go out —
a medical man, and one such must by law
wait in attendance on the pampered knout
and lend his countenance to what he saw,
lest the pet, patting with too bared a claw,
be judged a clumsy pussy. Bitter and hard,
see, as I see him, in that jailhouse yard.
Or see my thought of him : though time
may keep
elsewhere tradition or a portrait still,
I would not feel under his cloak of sleep
if beard there or smooth chin, just to
fulfill
some canon of precision. Good or ill
his blood's my own ; and scratching in
his grave
could find me more than I might wish to
have.
Let him then be much of the middle style
of height and coloring; let his hair be
dark
and his eyes green ; and for that slit, the
smile
that seemed inhuman, have it cruel and
stark,
but grant it could be too the ironic mark
of all caught in the system —who the most,
the doctor or the flesh twined round that
post?
There was a high wind blowing on that
day ;
for one who would not watch, but looked
aside,
said that when twice he turned it blew
his way
splashes of blood and strips of human
hide
shaken out from the lashes that were plied
by one right-handed, one left-handed
tough,
sweating at this paid task, and skilled
enough.
That wind blows to your door down all
these years.
Have you not known it when some breath
you drew
tasted of blood? Your comfort is in
arrears
of just thanks to a savagery tamed in you
only as subtler fears may serve in lieu
of thong and noose —old savagery which
has built
your world and Jaws out of the lives it
spilt.
For what was jailyard widens and takes in
my country. Fifty paces of stamped earth
stretch ; and grey walls retreat and grow
so thin
that towns show through and clearings—
new raw birth
which burst from handcuffs —and free
hands go forth
to win tomorrow’s harvest from a vast
ploughland—the fifty paces of that past.
But see it through a window barred
across,
from cells this side, facing the outer gate
which shuts on freedom, opens on its loss
in a flat wall. Look left now through the
grate
at buildings like more walls, roofed with
grey slate
or hollowed in the thickness of laid stone
each side the court where the crowd stands
" this noon.
One there with the officials, thick of build,
not stout, say burly (so this obstinate man
ghosts in the eyes) is he whom enemies
killed
(as I was taught) because the monopolist,
clan
found him a grit in their smooth-turning
plan,
too loyally active on behalf of Bligh.
So he got lost; and history passed him by.
But now he buttons his long coat against
the biting gusts, or as a gesture of mind,
habitual; as if to keep him fenced
from stabs of slander sticking him from
behind,
sped by the schemers never far to find
in faction, where approval from one
source
damns in another clubroom as of course.
This man had Hunter's confidence, King’s
praise ;
and settlers on the starving Hawkesbury
banks
recalled through twilight drifting across
their days
the doctor’s fee of little more than thanks
so often ; and how sent by their squeezed
ranks
he put their case in London. 1 find I lack
the hateful paint to daub him wholly
black.
Perhaps my life replies to his too much
through veiling generations dropped be-
tween.
My weakness here, resentments there,
may touch
old motives and explain them, till I lean
to the forgiveness I must hope may clean
my own shortcomings; since no man
can live
in his own sight if it wilt not forgive.
Certainly I must own him whether or not
it be my will. I was made understand
this much when once, marking a freehold-
lot,
my papers suddenly told me it was land
granted to Martin Mason. I felt his hand
heavily on my shoulder, and knew what
coil
binds life to life through bodies, and soul
to soil.
There, over to one corner, a bony group
of prisoners waits; and each shall be in
turn
tied by his own arms in a human loop
about the post, with his back bared to
learn
the price of seeking freedom. So they earn
three hundred rippling stripes apiece, as
set
by the law's mathematics against the debt.
These are the Irish batch of Castle Hill,
rebels and mutineers, my countrymen
twice over: first, because of those to till
my birthplace first, hack roads, raise
roofs; and then
because their older land time and again
enrols me through my- forebears; and I
claim
as origin that threshold whence we came.
One sufferer had my surname, and thereto
“Maurice,” which added up to history
once;
an ignorant dolt, no doubt, for all that
crew
was tenantry. The breed of clod and
dunce
makes patriots and true men : could I
announce
that Maurice as my kin I say aloud
I’cl take his irons as heraldry, and be
proud.
Maurice is at the post. Its music lulls,
one hundred lashes done. If backbone
shows
then play the tune on buttocks! But feel
his pulse ;
that’s what a doctor’s for,; and if it goes
lamely, then dose it with these purging
blows —
which have not made him moan ; though,
writhing there,
“Let my neck be,” he says, “and flog me
fair.”
One hundred lashes more, then rest the
flail.
What says the doctor now? “This dog
won’t yelp;
he’ll tire you out before you’ll see him
fail;
here’s strength to spare; go on!” Ay,
pound to pulp;
yet when you’ve done he’ll walk without
your help,
and knock down guards who’d carry him
being bid,
and sing no song of where the pikes are
hid.
It would be well if I could find, removed
through generations back —who knows
how far? —
more than a surname’s thickness as a
proved
bridge with that man’s foundations. I
need some star
of courage from his firmament, a bar
against surrenders: faith. All trials are
less
than rain-blacked wind tells of that old
distress.
Yet I can live with Mason. What is told
and what my heart knows of his heart,
can sort
much truth from falsehood, much there
that I hold
good clearly or good clouded by report;
and for things bad, ill grows where ills
resort :
they were bad times. None know what
in his place
they might have done. I’ve my own faults
to face.


ficuffli in ifae

When I wrote from London recently about'
the campaign for better roads in Britain, the point
to which I was working was that no country can
afford to have an inadequate road system.
Transport is a commodity; and like every
other commodity, it must be efficiently provided.
More than that, it is a major key to costs
in production.
In showing how other countries are pressing
ahead with the improvement of roads they
already possess, it is interesting to look at
America. In the United States I have seen
something of the progress being made in building
a 41,000-mile inter-State highway system in a
thirteen-year Federal programme estimated to
cost £A17,000-million.
Where our physical problem differs from
that of older countries is in the accentuating fact
that our half-million miles of roads and tracks of
every description are spread over a continent, and
for the greater part they are still unmade.
To the provision of major arterial roads and
the relief of city congestion we must add the task
of building to distance: to a continental depth to
serve our wide rural requirements.
My point here—for our need of roads is too
well known to be laboured—is that the urgency
with which we tackle this work will be one of the
real tests of our Faith in the Future of Australia.
Time is also a commodity. Our actual
development is only relative to the rate at which
we develop. And that will be determined very
largely by the speed at which good access is
provided and transport for industry and commerce
is made more fluid.
So a really determined national policy of road
construction becomes more than a question of
economy: it is a question of plain common-sense.
Finance, admittedly, is the governing factor.
But that, too. is relative when we-put it alongside
Faith, Courage, and the will in leadership to give
Australia the sinews of greater strength. .

use for the home as the basis
of social life.
Women are encouraged to
tackle any jobs, and the Ameri-
cans found that in steel-mills
about a quarter of the workers
were women, often doing heavy
work alongside men. Nur-
series and kindergartens are
there so tfcfti parents can leave
their kids under State super-
vision while they work in the
mills. Housing is critical.
“I just made it—it Was a bit difficult getting
off the chain tonight."
There is no question of build-
ing individual houses to solve
the problem. Instead, they are
building countless blocks of
flats in pre-cast concrete with
brick facing, all standardised,
and all designed in Moscow.
C'o much for the workings of
the Russian steel-industry
and the people who make it
tick. Just what does it all
amount to? Here are the find-
ings of Ryerson and his
colleagues—a group of hard-
headed representatives of
American industry :
“The Soviet steel-industry is
today by far the largest steel
operation in the world under
a single management. Supple-
menting its 1958 capacity of
approximately 60-million net
tons of ingots is an additional
capacity of some 18-million net
tons in the satellite countries
of Czechoslovakia, Poland,
Hungary and East Germany.
“This giant steel operation
has tremendous resources, not
only for production but also
for expansion, for modernisa-
tion and for all kinds of
research nad development.
“The Soviet Union has an
extensive, long-range plan for
expanding the steel-industry.
In 1957 steel-production was
56-million net tons of ingots.
Plans call for increasing this
to at least 70-million net tons
by 1960 and to 125 million by
1975.
“In conversation with the
delegates, the Soviet steelmen
indicated that larger units of
production equipment will be
installed to carry-out expansion
plans. They talked of coke-
ovens with 50 per cent, greater
capacity than present ovens;
blast-furnaces to produce pos-
sibly 5000 tons of pig-iron per
day. They also mentioned a
design for an open-hearth
furnace to produce 1000-ton
heats—about twice the size of
the largest in the world today.
There are seven new blast-
furnaces being installed in the
Soviet Union this year, each
of which has a stated capacity
of 3000 net tons per day.
“Observations of the dele-
gates indicate that probably 80
per cent, of Russian steel-
products at present are for use
in State projects, particularly
for industrial, power, railroad
and military needs.
“That large exports of Soviet
steel are an ultimate possibility
rests on the fact that Moscow
can slow industrial-expansion
programmes at any time it
chooses, and sell the steel thus
made available to any place in
the world. Such a trade move
will become easier to perform
as more Soviet steelmaking
capacity comes into operation.”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
More Money for Housing
Quoting an analysis of the
housing situation by a
distinguished economist, the
“Money for Homes” cam-
paigners point out that in the
period 1955-75 a bare two
decades, of which three years
have already elapsed the
number of persons in the main
marriageable-age group in Aus-
tralia will double, and that
this is the vital inescapable fact
affecting the demand for
housing.
Unless house-construction is
stepped-up immediately to
75,000 homes annually, and
increased to at least- 80,000
in five years’ time the housing-
shortage will become chroni-
cally acute. Physically, there
is no reason why 80,000 homes
cannot be built each year.
Almost that output was
achieved in 1952, in spite of
deficiencies in material and
skilled labor. The real barrier,
as everyone knows, is lack of
finance for housing.
The campaigners’ suggested
remedies for the position
include increased allotments by
the Commonwealth to the
States for housing purposes,
further releases from the banks’
special-deposit accounts, diver-
sion of part of the investment-
money now going into hire-
purchase, and allocations from
Commonwealth revenue on a
similar basis to the financing of
public works from this source.
From the realist angle, there
is no single solution to the
problem of increasing housing-
finance. Probably some or all
of the above suggestions could
be implemented to a limited
extent; but political considera-
tions would almost certainly
preclude their use on a suffi-
cient scale to meet the full
needs of housing-finance.
What appears to be over-
looked is the role of the private
investor, who, in the last
analysis, holds the nation’s
pursestrings. After all, it was
private investment that pro-
vided all our housing before
the war, and provided it ade-
quately, if the abundance of
houses to let on a modest rental
was any criterion.
What can be done to increase
the flow of private capital into
housing? The obvious course
would be to make such invest-
ment at least as attractive as
other forms of investing surplus
funds not necessarily by
raising the interest-rate on
loans and mortgages, which
would merely make housing
more costly.
For one thing, something
along the lines of the American
system of guaranteeing housing-
loans could be attempted.
Under this system, practically
the whole of the money
required for house-purchase is
lent by the private investor.
The Government merely
guarantees repayment of loans,
thus giving the investor full
security and a big inducement
to lend, and relieving itself of
the responsibility of finding
large sums for housing pur-
poses.
Another angle of attack
would be further relaxation of
restrictive landlord-and-tenant
legislation, which at present
severely discourages the build-
ing of houses for rental.
Finally, housing-investment
might well be regarded as a
form of national service worthy
of reward, and income from
this service could be treated
on the same generous basis,
for taxation purposes, as
interest from Governmental
loans for public works and
similar requirements.
In short, inducement to the
private investor, not restric-
tions upon his activities, should
be the keynote of the housing-
finance programme. It’s no use
condemning hire-purchase com-
panies for their appeals to
the public, or the latter for
responding; what’s needed is
sound financial reason why
spare funds should be diverted
to the housing field. —D. J. G.

“A Digger’s Last Wish”

Last Wish” (B. 12/11/’5B), the
par. on Allonville burials is not
quite correct. It was in 1918
that the shell hit the barn, and
most of the men killed were
members of the 14th Battalion
(Jacka’s mob) brass-band. The
shell was a direct hit and took

The Run On the Bank
In his letter on King
O’Malley (B. 1/10/’5B), J. D.
Corbett says that I overlooked
the fact that there was in
Sydney a most serious run on
the Commonwealth Savings
Bank after Lang’s bank had
closed its doors. That run was
dramatically stopped by a
forthright broadcast made by
Sir Robert Gibson, chairman
of the bank board.
Referring to the report of
the Royal Commission on
Money and Banking, 1937, it
is very clear that, from July,
1930, to June, 1931, there was
a general tendency towards a
reduction of savings - bank
deposits throughout Australia.
To a large extent this was due
to the depression, which com-
pelled depositors to use their
savings. A further cause was
investment in the Common-
wealth loans which closed in
July and December, 1930. In
the case of New South Wales,
however, a large part of the
reduction must be attributed to
apprehension in the minds of
depositors.
Withdrawals in excess of
deposits from the Government
Savings Bank of N. S. Wales
between April 1 and 22, 1931,
were about £4,000,000, of
which £1,675,000 was with-
drawn on April 22. The Gov-
ernment Savings Bank’s cash
resources then being exhausted,
there was no alternative but to
suspend .further payments, and
it was closed to business after
April 22, 1931.
Excess of withdrawals over
deposits from July, 1930, to
June, 1931, is shown at
£17,469,000. The failure was
a result of political causes
rather than financial, and the
responsibility must be borne by
those whose conduct created
apprehension in the minds of’
depositors.
Beside this classic example
of a frenzied, panic-stricken
“run on a bank,” the figures
for the Commonwealth Savings
Bank show for this same period
nothing that would warrant the
use of the term “run on a
bank,” which Mr. Corbett
enlarges to “most serious run.”
The percentage of excess
withdrawals over deposits of
the N. S. Wales Government
Savings Bank was 24.73. The

against the impossible task of
organising such rapid develop-
ment as has taken place there
without a Government grant to
help, and in my opinion the
board is right. Right or wrong,
however, someone must carry
on, and a commissioner has
been appointed.
“P.S.” is inconsistent when he
says, first, that “councils...,
manage [things]” and then that
“most councils are in the hands
of their officers.” He can’t have
it both ways, although, in fact,
both set-ups do obtain in differ-
ent places, some with arrogant
and muddling councils and
pliant and incompetent execu-
tives, others with supine
councils and dictator - like
officers. In between, the
majority strike a useful balance
most of the time.
“P.S.” is not alone in his
inconsistency, as it applies to
the public generally. They want
it both ways—a keen and effi-
cient officer always on the ball
and running the show as it
should be run, and a team of
members doing just what the
ratepayers, individually, want
them to do. Quite impossible,
of course. I have been (and
still am) a ratepayer, I have
been a board-member, and am
an executive officer now. I
know the picture from all sides,
as I have even been an ordinary
road-gang employee, and a con-
tractor.
There is no easy answer to
this problem. We must retain
local-government—it is vital to
our whole way of life. One
aspect that holds hope for the
future is the increased insistence
on proper training. The W.A.
University is being urged to set
up a professional course in
local - government. R.H.G.

Assimilation Dangers
Copra-producers in New
Guinea were in a happy mood
at the end of November,
when prices soared to
£95 6s. 6d. a ton and were
described by local experts as
“fantastic.” ~ At one period
the price rose £6 in 10 days.
A welcome change for those
planters who before World
War II were collecting a
measley £5 to £6 a ton.
The rise is said to be caused
by a decline in Philippines
copra-production, delay in
shipping and operations by
buyers for desiccators.
A note of warning has been
sounded by a Government
Agricultural Officer in
Moresby to the effect that high
copra prices could force
margarine - manufacturers to
switch from copra to vegetable


oils, which are cheaper.
Another price-reducer could
be the growing hostility of Aus-
tralian Governments towards
“filled” milk.
The non-native producers
naturally understand the
vagaries of the market, but to
the native producer, selling
through his co-operative
society, the downward fluctu-
ation presents a problem. Be-
cause of his lack of knowledge
of modern economics, he is
inclined to be suspicious of
the integrity of the white
buyers. It is from such doubts
and misunderstandings that
anti-white attitudes are created
and too often lead to embar-
rassing situations, giving im-
petus to the much-discussed
“cargo cultism” existing ill
many New Guinea areas.
The gulf between native
economic standards and our
own is illustrated in the recent
report of the Registrar of
Native Co-operatives in P.N.G.
(a European), who said that
during the past year about
£20,000-worth of goods had
been stolen, embezzled or
taken unlawfully on credit. The
thefts were small and little
could be done, he said, adding
that “the native people did
not regard embezzlement or
taking of goods from their
own co-operative societies as
theft, as would a European.”
Assimilation, to be successful,
should be a slow process ; even
in this speed age.—Gelt

Christmas Music
Once again cathedral choirs,
parish choirs and choral
societies have been making the
most of the Christmas season.
And once again it seems that
there’s room for a reorganisa-
tion of musical activities —we
have ample facilities in Sydney
for a more vivid and shared-in
presentation of Christmas
music.
Last year conductor Fritz
Rice and the Pro Musica choir
presented in the University
Great Hall a programme of
carols interspersed with Christ-
mas hymns which the audience
stood and sang. This, as Sellar
and Yeatman would say, was a
Good Thing; I’m sure no one
there regarded it in the same
light as, say, a performance of
“Messiah,” where choir and
orchestra bellow on and on and
on. Further, by participating
in the show, onlookers un-
doubtedly got the impression
they were helping it to go over.
Which, of course, they were.
What seems to be needed is
an annual festival of carols,
extending perhaps over two
days, using the combined
resources of local and city
choirs. On the basis of the
Pro Musica lead, the Town Hall
might be hired; the audience
could join-in. the Christmas
hymns. Such an annual event
would surely prove popular, not
only with audiences but with
choirs —all choirs love singing
carols. If a scheme along these
lines were considered, I feel
sure that the Australian repre-
sentatives of the Royal School
of Church Music would jump
at the chance of lending
support.—A.W. (N.S.W.).
The Farm Horse
“Herosene’s” reference to
our fast-diminishing horse-
population (B. 12/11 /’5B) be-
came highly topical when, a
few days later, the S.A. branch
of the Commonwealth Clydes-
dale Society announced a
nation-wide appeal for funds
to erect a memorial to the Aus-
tralian farm-horse for the part
it played in the country’s rural
development.
Our farms nowadays are
almost devoid of any flesh-and-
blood horsepower—you might
travel the countryside all day
and never set eyes on one
team (not even a pair) at work
in the paddocks; only an
occasional lone neddy kept
specially for one-horse jobs,
like potato-hilling or scuffling.
The S.A. body’s move is
commendable, both for the
sentiment and as a historic
record. After all, our responsi-
bility to posterity ■ demands
that we pass on some lasting
recognition and documentary
record of the changing scene
of Australian life, era by era.
As a matter of fact the
Clydesdale’s contribution to
Australia’s development was
never solely rural. The breed,
the heavy draught-horse, did
most of the heavy yakker in
getting our capital cities into
any sort of civic shape. Take
Sydney. Years ago the Sydney
City Council kept up its
tempo of progress with about
350 draught-horses (including
those belonging to full-time
contractors). Indeed, the horse-
era of Sydney’s civic history
ended only a year or so ago
with the retirement (to well-
earned clover-pasture) of the
council’s last horse —a fine
specimen of Clydesdale named
Herbie, aged 23.
Herbie’s last job was carting
the overnight refuse from Hyde
Park. Nearly four years ago,
writing in a Sydney paper, I
suggested that Herbie and his
antique-looking dray should be
perpetuated by a plaque in
Hyde Park or other sculptural-
piece in recognition of what
Sydney owes to horses. Now,
on the strength of the S.A.
Clydesdale body’s decision, I’d
like to repeat it. —Frank Snow

Siviss Souffle
By MORGAN JONES
Adelboden lay scattered
in the Engstligen Valley.
It was mid-winter, and
the Lohner Range was
thick and white with snow.
The mountains rose behind the
village, their lower slopes
lined with snow-heavy firs.
The trees were mottled-white
with the previous day's fall,
and their branches were pen-
dulous with the extra weight.
I turned to Margaret and
said, “We’ll stay" at that inn
haifway up the valley. The
one with the smoke curling
from the chimney.”
Margaret strained her eyes
to see which one l meant. “I
don’t believe I can see it,” she
said.
“Yes you can. Over there by
that isolated fir.”
“That's not a fir,” she
corrected me. “It’s a Nor-
wegian spruce.”
“Well,” I said, “I don’t care
whether it’s an Indian cedar.
You can see which building I
mean.”
“Look, Robert!” she said
excitedly. “Look at those skiers
over there.”
She pointed her finger at
three skiers coming down a
slope that ran through the
trees. There were faint plumes
of snow where the skiers had
braked to change direction. If
it hadn’t been for the puffs of
snow she might not have
noticed them.
“That peak over there's
called the Windstrubel,” 1 said.
“What a nice name. It re-
minds me of German beer.”
Che was still looking at the
skiers. Her blonde hair
had fallen over her eyes, and
with an impatient gesture she
smoothed it back into place.
“We’ll do the same thing
soon,” I said. “You can chase
me through the trees, and when
I'm caught I'll marry you.”
Margaret laughed, the high,
light laugh that 1 knew so well.
1 kissed her quickly, afraid of
being seen, and looked once
again at the village of Adel-
boden.
“Where shall we leave the
car for tonight?” she asked.
“Outside the inn of course.
Then in the morning we can
make an early start for the
skiing slopes.”
“But look at the roads," she
said. “They’re snowed-under.
We'll never be able to drive
over them.”
“Yes we will. They’ll have
the snow-ploughs out by then.
In any case,” 1 added, “they’re
doing it already.”
“So they are,” she said. “I
hadn't noticed them before.”
TPwo snow-ploughs, working
- 1 side by side, were clearing
the main road bisecting the
valley. They were submerged,
their great rotors swirling the
snow to either side of the road.
“I hope it’s not going to be
too crowded.”
“Where?” Tasked.
“At the inn.”
“I don’t expect it will be.
There don't seem to be many
cars down there.”
“How many can you count?”
I peered down at the inn.
There were high banks of snow
beside the road running by the
building, and I could count
eight small cars parked there.
“Eight,” I replied.
“You’re wrong,” she said.
“I can see nine.”
“Where’s the extra one?”
“Just behind the inn.”
“Oh, yes,” I said. “You’re
right.”
“PURTHUR down the road from
* the inn was a wooden
church with a tall black steeple.
The sun was shining on the
large windows of the church
and winking at us.
“How about going to churcm
tomorrow morning?” I sug-
gested.
“I wonder what denomina-
tion it is?”
“That doesn't matter. Just
the fact that we’ve been to a
Swiss church in the morning
would be good enough. Per-
haps they’ll ring their bell
when we’re in bed. I’ve
always wanted to wake-up in
the morning, in an alpine
valley, with the sound of a
church-bell in my ears.”
‘‘isn’t it a pretty church,”
she said. “Just like the ones
on Christmas-cards.”
“Well,” I said. “Shall we?”’
“All right.”
VX7E looked down in silence
""at the valley. The sun was
shining brightly on the snow,
and the sides of the mountains
were funnelled like sand is,
after the tide goes out.
I said, “This is going to be
the most beautiful holiday
we've ever had.”
“We’ll ever have,” she
amended.
“Perhaps you’re right,” I
agreed.
“One day we’ll be able to
tell our children about the first
night we slept in a real Swiss
inn. Just think of it, Robert.
Every time we tell them it'll
be like new again.”
“Umm,” 1 murmured.
I was looking at the house
sides and fences in the valley
below. They were the only
things which had avoided the
falling snow. Outside the
houses there were stacks of
wood. The wood looked so
close you felt you could
almost scent the resin. Down
the left-hand side of the valley
ran a small stream with a
solid wooden bridge spanning
it.
Margaret said, “I think
we’d better go now. It’s almost
five-o'clock.”
T carefully replaced the
book of Swiss scenery on
the library shelf.

ENGINE HORSEPOWER
[Based on information supplied by C. R. Ward-Ambler,
B. Mech. E. (Melb.), Caterpillar of Australia Pty., Ltd.]
TTorsepoyver started from
measurement of the work-
ability of a horse. It was
found that by means of a
pulley a horse could lift an
average weight of 5501 b. one
foot in one second, and this
unit became known as one
horsepower and is uniformly
used to measure the speed or
rate of working.
When considering engines
it's more convenient to express
horsepower in the terms of
torque, speed and rotary
motion. Torque describes the
turning-effort (as with a lever),
usually in units of foot-pounds.
For example, a force of one
pound on the end of a lever or
wrench one foot long pro-
duces a torque of one foot-
pound. Speed is the r.p.m. of
the engine. The equation for
determining rotary motion is:
Horsepower = T (Torque) x
'N (Speed) x a constant —or
more simply: HP = TxN.
This equation gives a clue

Results have shown
that sheep on restric-

to the important facts about
horsepower. Since many
engines are operated at a
constant horsepower it’s evi-
dent that with constant horse-
power there can be a large
“When is SHE goin' up, lad ?”
amount of torque and slow
speed, a small amount of
torque and high speed, or
any of the ranges in between.
This factor is important, as
sometimes we are not so much
interested in how fast a job can
be done as in how much
effort is available. Take the
example of a crawler-tractor
that must move a heavy load.
It is easy to see that for shifting
the load the turning-effort of
the sprocket which powers the
tracks is the important factor.
Thus, with a heavy load a low
gear is selected which gives
a high torque but a slow speed.
Often it is the torque avail-
able at a given speed of opera-
tion which will govern the
horsepower of the engine or
tractor selected.
Measuring Horsepower
Let’s look at an engine and
see what happens to the fuel
used. The fuel operating the
engine is a potential source of
horsepower. However, norm-
ally only about 30 per cent,
of this potential horsepower
arrives as usable horsepower
at the flywheel. Some of the
remainder is lost as heat and
unburnt fuel in the exhaust-
gas, some goes in heat to the
radiator, some to powering
of auxiliaries, such as pumps,
fan, generator and other power
take-offs, and the rest in
miscellaneous losses like heat
lost by radiation and friction.
The factor of prime import-
ance is the flywheel-horsepower
available the horsepower
that is measured. All the
various horsepower-losses here
mentioned must add-up to the
original amount of fuel used
in what is known as a “heat"
or “power-balance.” For a
given amount of fuel the
exhaust, cooling and miscel-
laneous losses are approxi-
mately constant, but if the
auxiliaries are powered by
some outside source, then the
flywheel-horsepower is in-
creased by an equivalent
amount.
For calculating the horse-
power of an engine the out-
put-shaft is connected to an
instrument known as a dyna-
mometer, which can apply a
load to the shaft and at the
same time measure and com-
pound speed and torque to give
horsepower. In such tests
some, or all, of the auxiliaries
are disconnected from the
engine or are powered extern-
ally to permit the highest
possible value of flywheel-
horsepower.
Maximum Horsepower
The components of engines
are designed to work under
certain load-conditions for a
certain period of time but with
the ability to withstand higher
loads for a shorter period of
time. Use is made of this fact
when measuring the maximum
horsepower.
To do this, some or all of
the auxiliaries are powered
externally or disconnected and
the fuel-input is increased, so
that the engine runs at its
maximum speed. The load
applied to the engine through
the dynamometer is then
gradually increased until the
engine-speed just starts to drop
(i.e., just before the engine
begins to lug-down). This
horsepower-level is held for a
brief time and recorded as the
maximum horsepower.
The period for which the
engine is required to sustain
this horsepower without drop
in engine-speed varies with
manufacturers between lmin.
and smin. Remembering the
ability of components to with-
stand high loads for short
periods and the ability of
the engine to develop high
horsepower for short periods,
it is easy to understand
that when maximum-horse-
power ratings are being calcu-
lated the period of sustained

power must be considered.
Consequently, if two engines
of the same quoted maximum
horsepower are being com-
pared, and one is based on a
one-minute period and the
other on a five-minute period,
the one rated for the five-
minute period would actually
have the greater capacity.
When applying an engine to a
job, maximum horsepower is
virtually meaningless and
serves only as a doubtful basis
for comparison between
engines.
Other Ratings
In stating horsepower avail-
able under particular condi-
tions, however, these are the
other ratings which must
govern the selection of engine:
Intermittent horse p o w er
should be considered in con-
ditions where the ioad is con-
tinually varying, as in ex-
cavators, hoists, shovels and
tractors, and where the dura-
tion of full power required
would be one hour or less. This
horsepower may be from 15
per cent, to 25 per cent, less
than the maximum horsepower
at any engine-speed.
Rated .horsepower should be
considered where sustained full
power may be required for up
to 12 hours, as in mills or rock-
crushers. It is usually 30 per
cent, to 40 per cent, less than
maximum horsepower.
Continuous horsepower is
required where power must be
sustained 24 hours a day for
weeks, months or years, as in
pumps or marine engines. This
horsepower is 5 per cent, to
10 per cent, less than rated
horsepower.
The horsepower available
from the flywheel of an engine
is not the end of the story.
Let’s consider what happens to
'he usable horsepower when
the engine output-shaft is not
connected directly to the load.
Whenever gears are used
horsepower will be lost
through being dissipated in
heat and wear between sur-
faces. Thus the transmission
°| a direct-drive tractor, in-
cluding all gears, may cause
the actual output-horsepower
to the tracks to be some 15
Per cent, less than the flywheel-
horsepower. In crawler-tractors
this leads to the measurement
of drawbar horsepower, which
g'ves the actual power avail-
aole at the tracks. Torque-
converters, where used, cause
ar > even greater loss of horse-
power, and here the horsepower
available to the tracks may be
5 P er cent, to 40 per cent.
less than is available at the
flywheel.
So these questions must be
determined when thinking of
engine horsepower: (1) What
sort of engine - horsepower
must be considered for the par-
ticular application? (2) What
must be the basis for measur-
ing the horsepower? (3) What
auxiliaries were on the engine
when the horsepower was
measured? (4) What is hap-
pening between the engine and
the job? Is the primary con-
sideration really something
such as drawbar-horsepower?
It should be remembered
when evaluating engines that
the horsepower - rating may
vary between manufacturers,
and that the best appraisal of
comparative capabilities can
only be made by considering
the basis on which each engine
was tested. But by making use
of the points mentioned it is
easier to select an engine which
has the correct horsepower for
its particular application.
A Forage Harvester
“Van”: The Lundell forage
harvester, displayed at the
recent Orange Field Day,
looked just the machine needed
for cutting crops for hay and
silage.
For haymaking, this one
machine did the work of three
—mower, hay-conditioner or
crusher and side-delivery-rake'.
By means of a chute —which
directs the cut material down-
wards from the chopper-spout,
but keeps the chopped material
from falling hard to the ground
—the windrow is formed with
a tunnel running through it.
This allows the air to circulate
and gives quicker drying.
For silage-cutting, the down-
chute is removed and the
harvester used in the conven-
tional way with a trailer. With
this machine and a baler a
farmer could handle the
making of his hay and silage.
Two basic machines, where
otherwise it would take four
machines or five, if an
individual crusher was used.
Summer Turnips
“Sundowner”: In areas with
a reasonable rainfall, turnips
are the best catch-crop for
summer feed, surpassing other
quick-growing fodder-crops,
like rape or sorghum. The seed
is cheap (ss. to 7s. 6d. a pound),
and only |lb. an acre is
required. In eight or 10 weeks,

bulk of medium-quality but
succulent feed.
This speed of growth, com-
bined with the fact that noth-
ing remains after they have
been grazed in narrow strips
with the use of an electric-
fence, makes it possible for the
area to be prepared promptly
for an early autumn sowing of
crops or pasture.
The essentials of success
with turnips are to keep pre-
planting cultivation shallow
and to see that the main part
of the soil is firm and moist.
In temperate climates they
need at least 2in. of rain in
two months —rather more in
hot, dry areas.
New Zealand Red Globe is
the best variety, and is particu-
larly valuable for sowing after
failure of an earlier crop. A
catch-crop needs only about
•icwt. of super. To conserve
moisture, hitch the roller
behind the drill or behind the
covering-harrows used for
broadcast sowings.
The Australian Nut
“Myall”: The Australian
nut, sometimes called the
Queensland nut, is a native of
northern N.S.W. and southern
Queensland. It flourishes in
coastal scrub, but will thrive
almost anywhere on the coast
from Perth to Rockhampton.
It's well worth a trial in inland
districts where frosts are not
too severe. Once established, it
resists drought.
The tree will grow equally
well in rich scrubland or
poorer ground on wooded hill-
sides provided the soil is deep,
well drained and fairly rich in
humus. As the shell of the nut
is thick and hard, germination
is slow —it may be six months
before the young plant appears.
It’s best to sow the nuts in
four-gallon containers, and
when the young trees are large
enough cut out the bottoms,
and then plant tins and all.
This way there are no losses,
and the seedlings suffer no
check.
Give the trees ample room to
spread ; when setting them in
their permanent positions, 25ft.
apart is not too much to space
them. They need very little
attention, but a light pruning
may be necessary to train them
into shape.
The first crop is produced
when the trees are five or six
years old, and they will con-
tinue to bear heavily for 50
years or more. The trees are
ornamental, and provide good
shade. An avenue of them will
form an excellent windbreak.
The nut provides a profitable
sideline, which is more than
other ornamentals do ; and the
older the trees become the
heavier they bear. A fully
grown tree may reach to 60ft.,
but the average height is from
30ft. to 40ft.
The nuts vary in size, but
are generally about the size of
a large marble, with a haFd
shell and a kernel more richly
flavored than other nuts. When
the Queen visited Queensland
in 1954 she sampled some of
the nuts, and praised their
delicious quality. Recently the
Queensland Government
received a request from
Buckingham Palace for a
supply of these nuts for the
Queen, since they were not
available on the London
market. In response to this
request, 61b of shelled nuts
were dispatched by air-freight.
The Americans introduced
the tree into the States in
1869. Since then many millions
have been planted in Cali-
fornia and Hawaii. Over the
past 15 years a great deal of
attention has been given to its
cult vat on in both Queensland
and N.S.W., and a large acreage
has been planted. However,
demand greatly exceeds
supply it will probahly be
many years before there are
enough of them.
So far no disease has been
known to attack the tree, but
there are some insects which
affect the nut-yield. All of
these can be destroyed by
spraying the trees with a solu-
tion of D.D.T. at the strength
of 0.2 per cent, and repeating
the operation 14 days later.
flaking Grass Green
“Observer”: A new spray
and sprayer recently demon-
strated in Sydney's Hyde Park
turns grass green immediately
on application.
A combination of vegetable-
dye and growth-promoter,
sprayed on separately, it gives
an immediate shade of
Kentucky-green to- the grass
and also promotes the later
growth of green grass.
In addition, the sprayer can
be fitted to any hose and used
to spray insecticides ; it gives
a good coverage of trees in a
small orchard.
Lucerne
“Agricola”: The recent
widespread planting of im-
proved-pastures on all types of
soils has shown how versatile
lucerne is. Most improved-
pasture mixtures contain a
smattering of lucerne, and it
has persisted when all the rest
have died.
Land-preparation for lucerne
should start at this time of
year. Choose deep, well-drained
soil which will allow the roots
to penetrate deeply. They can
then tap the subsoil-moisture
and cont’nue to grow when
other plants are withering in
the blistering heat and dry
surface-soil.
Lucerne dislikes acid soils.
Lime is the best corrective, but
it's always wise to make sure
that the soil is over-acid
before spending money on
lime that may not be needed.
The seedbed should b®
firmed for planting, and if
possible a pre-sowing crop
cowpeas should be ploughed
well into the soil before lucerne
is planted. Repeated workings
to get this green-crop unof
will also keep weeds in check.
Lucerne-seed should never be
planted without inoculum
otherwise nodules wilH^Jj^

REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(4/12/’58)
In Queensland rainfall may be patchy during January,
although heavy rains are indicated in the Peninsula, north-
west and south-west areas, with possible flooding in the
south-western rivers, including the Maranoa and Condamine.
Heavy rains and widespread flooding are likely in February
and March.
N.S.W. may have only light to moderate patchy rains
in January, with better falls on the coast and Tablelands, and
on the n.-w. slopes and plains areas. General rains should
be received in February, although rainfall may be patchy
during the autumn.
The southern half of Victoria should receive good
rains in January, but with likelihood of flooding in the
southern rivers. However, the Mallee ~ and northern divi-
sions may have only patchy rains. Heavy general rains
are indicated for February, with good follow-on rains in
March.
The agricultural areas of South Australia may expect
moderate rains in January, but poor elsewhere. Moderate
to heavy rains are likely in the agricultural areas and north-
west interior during February.
In Western Australia light to moderate rains are indi-
cated in the Kimberleys during January, but rainfall else-
where may be poor. Apart from reasonably good rains in
the North Kimberleys, February may also be a month of
poor rainfall.

Once planted, the crop
should not be neglected. Con-
stant grazing will reduce the
leafy plant to a stalky, spindly
growth. If cows are grazed on
the lucerne, mow the field after
they are removed, in order to
keep the stalky growth to a
minimum and induce a fresh
leafy regrowth. If the paddock
is cut for hay, mow when no
more than a third of the field
is in flower, and don’t have the
mower-blades too low. So long
as the young shoots are not
damaged by the blades, a quick
regrowth will result.
White-butterfly
“North”: The cabbage-white-
butterfly, which bred to plague
proportions in the mild winter,
is said to have arrived in Syd-
ney a few years ago in a con-
signment of cabbages from
New Zealand ; it has now
spread through the cabbage-
producing districts on the
eastern coast of Australia.
This butterfly should not be
confused with the cabbage-
moth, which is a small greyish-
brown insect with a body-
length of and a wing-span
of lin. The cabbage-white-
butterfly has white or pale-
yellow wings with black tips.
The male has a black spot in
the centre of the wings, while
“Blast th' willy-willy !”
the female has two. The larvae
grow to more than lin. in
length, and are of uniform
velvety-green color; they are
voracious feeders, soon strip
the leaves from young plants
in the seedbed, and eat large
holes in those of maturing
plants, often burrowing into the
heart.
Both D.D.T. and 8.H.C.,
used either as liquid or
powder, will control the pest.
The first spraying should be
given in the seedbed, and the
second when the plants are
established in the field. Three
or four weeks later a third
spraying is needed, and a
fourth should be given just
before hearting begins. If in-
festation is severe, further
sprayings may be necessary, but
treatment should cease at least
three weeks before the heads
are cut. If powder is used,
dust the plants more fre-
quently, as this is washed-off
more easily than the spray.
Yams
“Big Billy”: A useful plant
to cultivate in the vegetable-
patch, the yam will do well
where it’s warm, especially in
a rich, well-drained soil of
light texture. Though
perennials, yams are suscep-
tible to frost, so should be
treated exactly like potatoes.
Sets should be planted 3in-
deep and 18in. apart in rows
2ft. apart, at a time when
there’s no risk of frost-damage
to the foliage. In areas where
the potato grows well yams
may be spaced more liberally
to gain full advantage from
their habits of spieading.
As the stems lengthen, cover
with light soil or compost to
within between 6in. and Sin.
of the top. This helps the
development of the tubers,
which need not be gathered
until late in the season, when
frost has cut down the foliage.
If the tubers are put in the
sun. for a while after gathering
they will lose their acidity.
Farm Hints
“L.H.8.G.”: To make wood-
work fire-resisting, put a little
sodium-silicate into a bucket
of water and spray wherever
flames or sparks may reach,
letting the mixture dry on the
wood. The old war-time
treadle-pump makes an excel-
lent sprayer. If sodium-silicate
isn’t available, use commercial
alum —one pound to a bucket
of water.
“C.A.A.”: A new medic,
'Medicago littoralis —shown at
the Mallee Research Station
field-day at Walpeup (Vick-
is well suited to areas other
than the M-allee districts when
used in conjunction with barrel-
medic.
“Billjim”: Seed - potatoes
that will cut no more than
four sets are better than larger
ones —with more than two cut
faces sets are more likely to
rot. Each seed-piece should
weigh about Roz.

Information Sought
Brief history of the Scandinavian
Hall, which used to stand at 107
Castlereagh Street, Sydney ?
It was built by Wiliam T. Johnson
and opened by him as a music-hall.
In the same year (1866) Johnson
opened the Scandinavian Hotel in
front of , it. In 1872 William
Kavanagh kept the hotel, whilst
Johnson remained proprietor of the
hall. In 1874 Johnny Sullivan, a
lightweight boxer, converted the hall
into Sullivan’s Athletic Hall, but his
venture failed, and in 1875 the
Scandinavian was unoccupied. For
a time it was used as a clothing-
factory, the front portion as a
shop; in 1878 George Gamferty
conducted it as a billiard-saloon.
The Bulletin occupied a portion
of it in 1880. In 1881 the hall was
renamed the Victoria and opened
for show purposes under the
managership of D’Arcy Reed. In
1882 it was renamed the Academy
of Music, and in 1890 the old
building was pulled-down and the
Garrick Theatre (afterwards the
Tivoli) was erected on the site.

Can camellias ( shrubs ) be raised
from seeds or cuttings '! If not, by
what method ?
Camellias are not raised from
seed; cuttings from year-old wood
placed in a glass-frame will some-
times take root. The best method
is to layer the low-growing limbs.
If they are too far from the ground
place in a tin or box on a stand
under the shrub and bend the limbs
into it. Cut the limbs with a
slanting motion where they bend in
the soil, and pin them down. Keep
the soil continually moist. If the
foliage remains green after two
months you can be sure that the
layers have struck and the limbs
can be severed from the parent
shrub. It is not advisable to shift
these layered shrubs into the open
garden until they are at least a
year old.

Brief account of Captain Scott’s
expedition to the South Pole ?
Consisting of 65 officers, scientists
and men under the leadership of
Captain Robert Falcon Scott, the
party set-up its main base at Cape
Evans on Jan. 4, 1911. (The area
is now known as Scott Base, and
has been N.Z.’s I.G.Y. h.q. in
Antarctica.) A lot of scientific and
exploratory work was done, and on
Oct. 24, 1911, after the Antarctic
winter, the first supporting groups
moved off towards the Pole, Scott’s
main mission. A party of five,
including Scott himself and Oates,
made the final dash to the
Pole, which they reached on Jan.
17, 1912, only to find that the
Norwegian Roald Amundsen had
beaten them to it by only 12
days. All five members of Scott’s
team perished on the way back, the
last three when only a day’s march
from safety. (It was over Scott’s
route that Sir Edmund Hillary
dashed to the Pole, reaching it on
Jan 3, this year—the first man to
reach the Pole on land since Scott.)

Some facts about falconry ? Is
the sport still followed ?
Falconry, or hawking, which dates
back to the Chinese. in 2000 b.c.,
was a popular recreation of the
aristocracy during the Middle Ages.
Training is done through the bird’s
appetite, and requires much
patience, care and gentleness. The
birds comprise two main classes,
“falcons” (long-winged hawks) and
“hawks” (short-winged hawks), the
wings of which are not pointed but
round. The falcon is gradually
accustomed first to the falconer's
voice, then to strangers, dogs and
horses, and is trained to catch his
quarry by using dead birds. When
fully trained the falcon will, when
a dog “points” the quarry, rise in
the air and wait on the game until
it is frightened into the air by the
falconer, where the hawk’s superior
speed always triumphs. Hawking
these days is fostered by the British
Falconers’’ Club. Falcons have been
used in war-time for the purpose of
catching carrier-pigeons. There is
an article on falconry in the
Encyclopcedia Britannica.

Some particulars regarding Hugh
M osman, discoverer of gold at
Charters Towers ( Q .) ? 1 was in
Charters Towers recently and was
surprised to see a public monument
in the main street in honor of
Jupiter Mosman, an aborigine, as
the discoverer of gold there.
Hugh Mosman (or Mossman, as
the name is sometimes spelt) was
born in Sydney, son of Archibald
Mosman, ship-owner and pastoralist,
and was educated at The King’s
School. He went to Queensland in
1860 to explore the country and
acquire properties. In these plans
he apparently did not succeed, and
spent the next 10 years mining gold
in various localities, mostly in
N.S.W. Returning to Queensland
in 1870, he prospected for gold in
the north, and in 1872 an aboriginal
youth in his employ, known as
Jupiter Mosman, stumbled on an
outcrop of gold while looking for
some lost horses. The rich Charters
Towers field developed from this
find. Jupiter Mosman was educated
at Mosman’s expense, and became
a respected figure in Charters
Towers. Hugh Mosman was
rewarded by the Queensland
Government with a grant of £lOOO
and a number of claims, and later
established several rich mines and
did much to further the interests of
the town. He also became a mem-
ber of Queensland’s Legislative
Council. Apparently both Hugh
Mosman and Jupiter Mosman can
be regarded as the discoverers of
Charters Towers goldfields.
Brief Answers
C.P.E.: Your theory on the correct
calling of “misere” is substantially
right. This call was never used
in" the Australian-English form 9!'
the game, and does not appear in
some books on the subject; it seems
to have been introduced by
migrants. Two useful small books
which would settle arguments are
Hoyle’s Rules of Games, by More-
head and Mott-Smith (4s. 9d.),
and Pocket BoQk of Games, by
Albert Morehead (3s. 9d.), both
from Dymock’s Book Arcade, Ltd.,
424 George Street, Sydney. Postage,
9d. on each b00k... .P.G.: In 1938
the Waterside Workers’ Federation
instituted a boycott of alleged war-
materials (such as tin clippings,
scrap-iron and tallow) consigned to
Germany and Japan. In particular
the ship Dalfram was held-up for
a long time at Port Kembla
(N.S.W.). On May 16 Prime
Minister Lyons told the federation
that the Government would take
action to secure the peaceful con-
tinuation of overseas trade, giving
it till May 25 to remove the
embargo. The embargo was duly
lifted at that time... .R.W.: The
1938 Australian cricket-team to
England consisted of 16 players —
Bradman (captain), Brown, Has-
sett, Barnes, Badcock, Fingleton,
McCabe, Chipperfield, O’Reilly,
Fleetwood-Smith, Barnett, Walker,
Waite, White, Ward and McCormick.
A.P.L.: If a beast is inocu-
lated against redwater (tick-fever),
cattle-tick attaching to such an
anjmal will, during feeding, become
infected with the causal germ of
tick-fever. As the cattle-tick does
not leave the host (other than the
mature female) to lay eggs, the
disease is not transmitted to another
■animal until the next generation of
cattle-tick develop. The larval-ticks
which develop from the eggs laid
by the infected female carry the
disease; as soon as these ticks
attach to a susceptible animal the
disease is transmitted J.F.D.:
Australia has no true coral-snakes.
A small land species that is prac-
tically harmless is sometimes called
the Australian coral-snake because
of its bright coloration. These are
often confused with brightly
colored sea-snakes found among the
coral reefs. The true coral-snake
(Elaps fulvius ) is found in southern
U.S.A. and is venomous... .M.P.:
If the husband is left without
adequate provision for maintenance
he can make application to the
Equity Court for an order for main-
tenance. In the circumstances
referred to his chances would be
slim... .L.T.: Warships that visited
Sydney during Australia’s sesqui-
centenary celebrations were the
Maoriland cruiser Achilles; the
United States cruisers Trenton,
Memphis, Milwaukee and Louis-

Dutch sloop Flores... .D.J.M.:
Not possible to give full replies to
your queries, which come under
the heading of the taxidermy of
lepidoptera. It is highly skilled
W'ork, involving the use of special
tools and sometimes poisonous or
dangerous chemicals. As you are
so close to Melbourne, pay a call
to the Museum in that city; alter-
natively, consult works on the sub-
ject in the public library, and from
a good bookshop get a list of
textbooks on the subject. A few
practical lessons from a taxidermist
would enable you to go by yourself.

LAMENT OF THE MAN IN THE

On many a loving pair I’ve gazed

In my visage no joy they find,

cottage, built of galvanised-
iron, the linings, partitions and
ceilings being of hessian bag-
ging, with newspaper pasted
over it in an attempt at neat-
ness. The floor was earth, the
windows were packing-cases.
An oven in the summer, an
ice-chest in the winter. And
when the Barwon was in flood
they had to abandon it, and
live in a tent on the higher
ground.
In this hut lived eight people
—man, wife and six children,
aged from two to 12. The
husband was 30 and the wife
Was 29. She looked over 40,
sunbrowned and wrinkled, and
hair streaked with grey. The
children were as clean and
tidy as their threadbare clothes
would allow. They were all
v ery shy, and though we tried
to make friends with them it
was of no avail.
We yarned till midnight,
mainly answering questions
about Sydney. They were
greatly interested, but I don’t
think they realised the size of
the place. Once the wife said:
It must be a lot bigger than
Brewarrina.” (Brewarrina at
mat time had a population of
about 500.)
When I spoke of the crowds
? . People, the height of the
mldings, the size of the ships
t bey had seen the Wandering
ew) they seemed a bit doubt-
U .°j m y truthfulness. Neither
could read or write, and both
aa lived their whole lives on
various stations, under similar
conditions to their present form
of existence.
These were the people of
whom Henry Lawson wrote.
The wife was one of his
“haggard women,” who fought
fires and floods, or sat all night
watching for a snake in the
house, while their husbands
were away for weeks or
months, droving or shearing.
The wage for a married station-
hand was £1 per week, with
double-rations ; namely, 201 b.
of flour, 201 b. of meat, 41b.
of sugar and |lb. of tea. Many
stations, including Boorooma,
were more generous with their
rations, but even if it was
doubled again I think it would
be a problem to satisfy two
adults and six growing children.
These people were the true
pioneers of the outback. No
development would have been
possible without them, but
they are never mentioned in
any history, nor have any
monuments been erected to
them.
Tt was the next day I saw
for the first time brolgas
(or, as they are also called,
native companions) dancing. I
had approached the river
quietly, and from the top of
a steep bank was able to look
down on them.
There were eight of them,
on a sand-bar running halfway
across the stream. There was
a definite pattern, somewhat
similar to the first set of
quadrilles, in their movements.
They would approach with
short steps and wings extended,
lay their necks together, wheei
and go back. They did this
movement several times ; then,
instead of touching necks, they
weaved in and out; then came
back to their original positions.
I watched them for about 20
minutes, but the two move-
ments were not added to.
Since then I have seen them
dancing many times, but there
has been no difference in their
routine.
As we went down the
Barwon the flocks of parrots
seemed to increase. Trees
would be white with cockatoos
one minute ; then there would
be a great cloud of them in
the air. In the afternoon the
galahs would be up in their
thousands. As one bird they
would swing, and what had
been a cloud of grey birds
would become pink. This would
go on for an hour or more,
and against the setting sun, with
the galahs alternately pink
and grey, it was a beautiful
sight.
And the ducks were in in-
credible numbers ; teal, black,
whistlers and wood - ducks
would rise in thousands, and
the whirr of their wings was
like a heavy windstorm.
was the next
station on the route. Noth-
ing doing, so on to Milray.
Captain Murray, owner and
manager, was an ex-Indian
Army officer, and always wore
the white uniform, complete
with topee. He ran the place
on military lines, with all the
men saluting before they
spoke, and standing to attention
in his presence.
Jack Stone told me the story
of how he and three mates
came to Milray two years
previously and, hoping to get
a good handout, posed as
soldiers, just back from the
Boer War. They practised
marching, saluting and form-
ing fours for hours.
Marching up to Captain
Murray, Jack saluted, and
asked for assistance, as one
soldier to another.
Murray was very affable, and
asked a few questions about
what battles they had fought,
and their regiments. Having
read the papers, Jack was able
to tell what he thought was
a good story, and Murray
seemed greatly impressed, and
said he would help them all
he could. As Jack tells the
story: “He formed us up,
said, ‘Quick march,’ and kept
us left-wheeling and right-
wheeling for a good half-hour.
I reckon we went round that
blanky yard twenty times.
Then he took us to the Bre-
warrina road, said ‘Quick
march’ again, closed the gate,
and started back towards the
homestead. I called out, ‘But,
Captain, what about the
rations?’ He turned and
snapped : ‘A good soldier never
questions an order, keep
marching.’ ”
Jack grinned ruefully, when
he finished the tale, and
remarked: “The old blankard
was having us on all the time.”

of animals. Beneth the Crib choirs sing
carols three nights a week. Bearded
Santa Clauses hang high in the centre of
the streets, and at night pyjama-clad
children gaze pop-eyed through the win-
dows of the Myer Emporium, where in
each of five windows there’s an episode
from the story of Aladdin and his lamp.
Outside Foy’s store the corner fasade
carries a giant Father Christmas who
rougishly winks one eye as he beckons
the children into the store. The shops
are crammed with expensive things, the
big spending rush is gathering momentum,
and all-in-all it looks like being a bumper
Christmas.

Best-dressed event of the week was the
gala-premiere of the film “The Ten Com-
mandments” held at the newly-decorated
and newly-named Barclay Theatre in
aid of the Yooralla Crippled Children's
Appeal. The Governor, Sir Dallas
Brooks, and the Premier and Mrs. Henry
Bolte were welcomed by Mr. N. B.
Rydge (chairman of directors of Greater
Union Theatres), Mrs. N. B. Rydge, and
the organiser of the committee which
arranged the premiere, Mrs. Leo Curtis.
With Sir Dallas Brooks was his daughter,
Mrs. Robin Byrne, who wore a geranium-
red velvet coat over her delphinium-blue
organza frock. Mrs. Bolte’s short frock
of pale-green satin was embroidered on.
the bodice with tear-drop pearls and
emerald-green sequins. With it she wore
a white Arctic-fox stole. Mrs. Rydge
chose a formal gown of coral-pink chiffon
made with a long, draped bodice ; her
wrap was an emba-mink stole. Mrs.'
Curtis’s short deep - cream guipure - lace
frock was cut on semi-chemise lines and
finished in front with a large tabac-brown
satin bow just below the bustline.
Dame Mary Daly (she is chairman of
the women’s group of the appeal-
committee) chose a frock of oyster satin,
the round neck embroidered with opales-
cent sequins and beads. Lady Selleck’s
choice was a short frock patterned with
a design in autumn tonings. Mrs.
Maurice Nathan’s frock of powder-blue
taffeta had a fitting bodice and a bell
skirt.
Mrs. Bing Molyneux and Mrs. G.
Osborne were the ticket-secretaries. Also
noted in the audience were Mrs. Charles
Davidson, her son Rodney and Marion
Gengoult Smith, Mr. and Mrs. W. K.
Burnside, Mr. and Mrs. Roy McFarlane,
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Christie, Mr. and
Mrs. Alec Lynch, and Barbara Spry,
accompanied by Warwick Purser. Pretty
programme-sellers included Anne Curtis
and Katie Calder; and, attractive in
shell-pink chiffons, Fay Laurens distri-
buted gift-lipsticks to women members
of the audience.

Frosted Christmas-trees were on indi-
vidual tables at the festive luncheon
held by the women’s group of the Royal
Commonwealth Society, at which the
guest-of-honor, Mrs. Henry Bolte, was
welcomed by the president, Mrs. L.
Gillam Hunt, and the honorary secre-
tary, Mrs. J. H. Mitchell. Among the
50 guests were Lady Norris, Mrs. R. S.
Wellby, Mrs. H. I. Fader (her husband
is the Consul for Thailand), Mrs. C.
MacDougall, Mrs. G. Parker, Mrs. J. M.
Maclntyre (Geelong) and Mrs. T. A.
Vasey (Newcastle).

A gaily decorated and brightly lit
Christmas-tree stood in the foyer of the
Toorak home of Dr. and Mrs. John
Heath when they entertained 50 guests
at a cocktail-party followed by a buffet-
dinner and dance. Their daughter and
son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Graeme Laws,
also had 50 of their young friends at the
same party. Mrs. Heath chose a
champagne-tinted guipure-lace frock
which had an inset-panel of matching
pleated-organza at the back of the skirt.
Mrs. Laws was attractive in a blue
polished-cotton frock patterned in an
old English-garden scene , and made with
a balloon-skirt. Among the guests were
Mr. and Mrs. Roy Dixon, Mr. and
Mrs. Jim Alston (her slim sheath-frock
of emerald-green wool), Mrs. Gray
Staley, Mrs. Eric Cottrell, Mrs. Norman
Spry, Mr. and Mrs. George Haines, the
Dudley Gordons (Frankston), Major and
Mrs. Kenneth Mair (the former Sue
Dowling), Mrs. Constance Day, Joy
Donoghue, Winsome Dane (both in
pretty white frocks), Anne Swallow, and
Rosemary Young.
Bunty Turner will be Eliza Doolittle
in “My Fair Lady,” which will have its
premiere at Her Majesty’s on January
24. The 22-year-old Irish-born actress
(her baptismal name is Isabella) studied
singing in England, graduating through
principal-girl roles in pantomimes into
musical-comedy. It was while she was
one of the leads in “Free As Air ” that
she won the coveted part of Eliza from
a field of 200. Bunty, who has delicate
features, a slim and graceful figure and
a charming manner, plans to bring her
mother here later.
CANBERRA
Visitors flocked to Canberra for the
Graduation Day parade and ball at the
Royal Military College, Duntroon, where
48 cadets received their commissions
after a parade which was inspected by
the Governor-General, Field-Marshal
Sir William Slim. Gay parasols, pro-
tection against a hot sun, with many
gold-braided uniforms among the spec-
tators, added to the picture. The C.O.
Corps of Staff Cadets, Lieut.-Colonel
C. M. I. Pearson; the Commandant,
R.M.C., Major-General J. G. N. Wilton,
and the Chief of the General Staff,
Lieut.-General A. R. Garrett, each
accompanied by his wife, were received


onto the parade-ground with due cere-
mony. The Governor-General, accom-
panied by Lady Slim, was accorded a
Royal Salute while his Excellency’s
standard was broken from the flagstaff.
Then, the inspection over, the Governor-
General presented diplomas and prizes
to the graduates and the remainder of
the cadets, the sword-of-honor going to
Senior Under-officer John Moody, of
Adelaide.
The Graduation Ball, which always
brings out glamorous ball-dresses, was
this year like an elegant fashion-parade,
and many lovely gowns were to be seen.
Perfect weather and hundreds of fairy-
lights on the terraces helped to make
the evening a gala one. Guests were
received by Senior Under-officer John
Moody and Mrs. Humphrey Bates, wife
of Colonel Bates ; she chose a full-length
gown in flame chiffon. A fanfare of
trumpets heralded the arrival of the
official party, which included Major-
General and Mrs. Wilton, she wearing
an attractive gown in silver-grey satin
patterned with small pink roses ; Lieut.-
General Garrett and his wife, who chose
smoke-grey brocade'; Lieut.-Colonel and
Mrs. Pearson ; Lieut.-Colonel Hardiman
and Mrs. Hardiman, she attractive in
turquoise tulle ; Lieut.-Colonel D. H.
Caughley, N.Z. Liaison Officer, and
Major Bradbury.
On the stroke of midnight “Casey’s
Ghost” made his annual appearance on
the dance-floor, and the pips of rank
were placed on the shoulders of the happy
young officers by their partners.
SYDNEY
On Wednesday’s oppressively hot
morning, the members of the Lady
Mayoress’s Relief Fund met in the lovely
drawing-rooms allotted to the Lady
Mayoress at the Town Hall. Roses —of
white and every color, including purple
—on large-brimmed hats, plus long,
white gloves were “uniform” dressing.
Cheques of £240 each were presented
to seven charities, which benefit every
year, and an eighth amount divided be-
tween other good works. Cheques for
£l2O were accepted by Mrs. C. J. Pope
for the Family Welfare Bureau (“we
work to keep homes together”), and by
Mr. T. H. Muirhead for Sydney Rescue
Society (“I do not think there is another
country in the world with the same
generous spirit in its midst”). The other
seven cheques were accepted by Lady
Parker for the Ladies’ Home Mission
("not a penny will be wasted”); Lieut.-
Colonel Olive Allitt for the Salvation
Army (“the needy of the city”); Miss
F Moorehead for Sydney City Mission
(‘a thousand Christmas-dinners to pen-
sioners”); Mr. J. F. Clack for N.S.W.
Ped Cross (“we need all we can get”);
Mr. S. Walden for St. Vincent de Paul
( not concerned that many are ‘no-
nopers’—the aim is to give immediate
relief”); M r . W. G. Charlton for the
benevolent Society (“abandoned infants
o neglected old-age pensioners”); and
me Rev. D. G. Cole for Presbyterian
°cial Services (“all in need”).
Later at the Town Hall, the body of
the hall, the galleries and the basement
were crowded with parents, “old boys,”
and pupils of Sydney Church of England
Grammar School for the annual prize-
giving, by Lieutenant-General Sir Eric
Woodward, and to farewell Headmaster
L. C. Robson after 36 years with “Shore.”
Lady Woodward wore pearls with a long,
grey-blue gown, and Mrs. Robson a black
dress with a burst of Talisman-rose-color
falling from one shoulder to a floor-
length hemline.
A lovely solitaire diamond ring is being
worn by Sue Woolcocks, who recently
announced her engagement. to Rodger
Johnson , of Mosman. Sue, who is the
daughter of Dr. and Mrs. R. J. Wool-
cocks, of North bridge, works in her spare
time for the Royal Institute for Deaf and
Blind Children. Norton-Trevaire photo-

Two Hunter River district pioneer
families were united when at St. Stephen’s
Church, Willoughby, last Wednesday
Margaret May, younger daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. G. O. Morrice, of Papanui,
Merriwa, and Brian William, only son
of Mr. and Mrs. N. S. Brooker, of Main
Camp, Upper Rouchel, exchanged vows,
with Archdeacon Tugwell officiating.
The bride’s beautiful gown was of off-
white satin-brocade; the “something
old” was represented by a Honiton-lace
veil which her mother had worn at her
wedding, and a fragment of orange-
blossom which had adorned the wedding-
dress of the ’groom’s mother. The brides-
maids were the bride’s sister Judith, and
Sandra Booth (East Lindfield); they wore
frocks of white hailspot nylon over
apricot. The ’groom was attended by
Alan MacDougall (Rouchel Brook) and
the bride’s brother Bill (Merriwa).
At the reception held at Windsor
Gardens, Chatswood, the 120 guests were
received by Mrs. Morrice, who gained
contrast for her smart teal-blue frock
with a pink hat; and Mrs. Brooker,
whose lovely blue frock and matching
jacket were topped with a hat in a
deeper shade of blue. Sir Alister
McMullin wrought smooth and witty
words in his toast to the happy couple.
Wearing a large hat of flower-printed
linen with a loose coral linen suit, Mrs.
M. Cornelius presided at the afternoon
tea-party at the Poet and Peasant
restaurant to launch The Cook’s Hand-
book, proceeds of which have been
donated by the author, Mrs. Doris State,
to the Teamakers’ Club, for the N.S.W.
Society of Crippled Children.
In cool green and a large biscuit straw,
Mrs. Ruby Bridger, a former Queen
Victoria Club secretary, was a guest of
Mrs. L. W. Williamson, one of the first
members of the Teamakers’ Club. Mrs.
Bridger has always been interested in
child - welfare originally in Westralia
with her sister (now Mrs. Charles Griffin,
of Lake Grace in that State, and a divi-
sional, president of the C.W.A.), when
they were in the Women’s Service Guild
and worked to raise funds for the
Children’s Protection Society, W.A., an
organisation similar to the Sydney Day
Nurseries. Much later, in Sydney, Mrs.
Bridger was the prime mover in having
the child-welfare legislation altered in
the interests of fatherless children, thus
bringing Australia into line with all other
British countries. She speaks highly of
all the main women’s organisations
which she eventually rallied behind her,
and in particular of Lady Street and her
co-operation.

At the other end of town, urchins
sailed toy boats in the circular shallow
pond in its own island in Victoria Park’s
lake ; young people splashed in the long
outdoor municipal swimming-baths be-
side the three-decker circular fountain
(the sound alone of its noisy waters is
refreshing); and a leashed greyhound
(winner of over £lOOO in prize-money)
stalked, lean and contemptuous, outside
the railings bordering the University
grounds. On its little hill, the University,
with the light of the setting sun behind
it, appeared larger than ever. Inside
the grounds khaki-drill uniforms part-
nered pale summer dresses along the
stone-flagged roads and covered ways
leading to the Christmas party of the
officers’ mess of the University Regi-
ment in the Home and Sutherland Room.
Immediately above, in the Withdraw-
ing Room, the Sydney University Arts
Association held its Christmas party to
the background music provided by the
Pro Musica Recorder Ensemble. The
president, Mr. David M. Selby, and Mrs.
Selby, received the guests, who drifted
up and down the red-carpeted stairs and
onto the long balcony, with green seats
and green-potted azaleas, which over-
looks the many spires and towers of the
University buildings. Outside, small
flocks of twittering birds rose and
wheeled against the greying sky before
settling for the night; and inside, upstairs
and downstairs, the music went on into
the night.


Innocents in Peru
There is something so engagingly
futile about Julian Tennant’s Quest
for Paititi (Parrish) that, maddening
though it must be to anybody expecting
a serious book about exploration in
Peru, it deserves a special mention.
Paititi is yet another of those mythical
lost cities of the Incas, supposed to be
the place where the Indians hid their
gold from Pizarro; and, accompanied
by an American barman named Bill
whom he met casually at luncheon over
12 bottles of hock, and under the
leadership of Sebastian Snow, who has
been seen in a previous travel-book
careering down the Amazon on a raft
-—or perhaps it was climbing the Andes
-—Tennant set off to find this fabulous
city. There were' the usual rumors
about ruins to guide him.
The first maddening thing about his
book is that it takes so long to get
going. At page 80 it does seem that,
having spent weeks and weeks
nervously reading-up about snakes in
London, and weeks more trying to get
their baggage through the Customs in
Callao, at last the three explorers are
on their way, poling a raft up a river
through the jungle. Unfortunately
they are washed back again by the first
rapid and have to take an aeroplane,
which is not the right way for intrepid
explorers to travel.
However, by page 109 they have
fairly started again, having said good-
bye to the Portuguese planter with his
seven wives, and it must be admitted
that from then on there is plenty of the
proper kind of suffering. They fall into
the river; they slip down precipices;
they are bitten by mosquitoes; they are
looked at, if not eaten, by snakes; they
run short of food and they do not like
the taste of monkey.
Moreover, they find Paititi. Or
something.
There is a wall 100 ft. high on top of
a mountain, and within it are smaller
walls, resembling fortifications, and
two “mounds” resembling heaven
knows what. They are a little
hampered in excavating these ruins
because they have not brought a spade,
but they hack a layer of stones off one
of the mounds with their machetes in
an attempt to break into it, only to find
that there is another layer behind it,
and another behind that, and a fourth
layer behind that . . . and there they
gave up.
Though at first Tennant seems
certain that the 100 ft. wall is man-
made, as also are the lesser walls and
the mounds, it modestly occurs to him
after a while that “as none of us was an
archeologist, it is quite possible that we
have misinterpreted what we saw”; that,
in fact, the great wall was an ordinary,
natural cliff (which it certainly looks
like in the photographs) and that the
mound they tried so arduously to enter
was just a natural, solid heap of granite
—they were trying to take the mountain
to pieces.
Still, there was the pot.
This mysterious object, which they
undoubtedly acquired from one of their
Indian porters at the site of the ruins,
was the great proof that they had
found, if not Paititi, at least a pot; so,
characteristically, they forgot to pack
it at the last moment when they were
leaving the jungle by plane. Eventually
it followed them to London; but it
arrived “smashed into hundreds of
pieces.”
Undaunted, the British Museum put
it together again for them and pro-
nounced it as unquestionably of Inca
origin. The only remaining difficulty
is that they were never really certain
where it came from. The Indian porter
did give it to them at the ruins, but
“where and how he picked it up we
never found out.”
Tennant is sure, however, that the
Indian did pick it up at the ruins; and
perhaps he did. Perhaps the 100 ft. wall
was, after all, man-made. Who is a
mere reviewer, who has never trudged
miles up a river in Peru, and slept in
a hammock in pink silk pyjamas along-
side the missionary’s wife, and eaten
pink bananas and boiled snails, to
argue the point with an author who has
done these things —to be anything but
grateful for his preposterous book?

SECOND CHILDHOOD
Being much with Margery for companion
From her discovery l borrow memory,
Recollection of tastes forgotten,
Flavors and treats, hates and prejudice ;
A strange logic and a wild unreason.
And I rediscover pain . . .
The outer, immediate agony of bleeding
knee,
Scratched arm, banged head, and after
The wallowing in comfort, the high exces-
sive laughter
That turns disaster into most exquisite
pleasure :
And later, pain transformed to an im-
portance
Of greying and horrible sticking-plaster
And the week-long fascination of peeling
scab,
Healing scar; the reprehensible desire
For further bloodier accident.
I find
Footpaths again cracks, crumbled
asphalt—where
The red leaves fall, which fence rattles
to a stick :
Judge shopmen by a biscuit or a sweet;
Know where the grocer s fat cat goes
when he
Deprives the shop-step of his magnifi-
cence ;
And which seat in the park
Is best for climbing on —its paint is peel-
ing
And flakes of it, as fragile as dead leaves,
Powder to dust before their shape’s half
treasured,
And through its sturdy slats
Stones, pins, sticks, grass fall to the dust
below
And mutely wait in confidence of rescue.
And even (how can years be sloughed
more surely?)
1 now can tell before her question comes
Which spry old gentleman or ancient lady
Or cheerful cur calls forth response from
her
More than another you’d think identical.
Either in oddity or in ordinariness.
Then, incantation : nursery rhymes by
the score
Re-learnt by heart, laughed with, found
sad again.
{And where’s the sorrow in a golden
pear
And why the catch at the throat the
almost tear?
For Mother Hubbard’s dog is merely
funny
And babies tumbling down from trees a
jest.)
I seek no answer more than does
Margery,
We sweep the moon together, she and l-
It is untrue that much can be learnt from
children,
The most I can do is borrow back from

A snatch of that lost land within the
heart,
Knowing, the while, that what I have is
mine
And what she gains is hers. I will never
see
Beyond the coastline of her territory.

Character Analysis: Wilhelm Reich,
M.D. (Vision). Dr. Reich is the dis-
coverer of “orgone therapy” in psycho-
analysis, originating in his study of
the “character-resistances” which were
a stumbling-block to the orthodox
Freudians; and in this large and
formidable work, which has reached its
third edition in America since first
published in 1933, he explains his
theories.
* * * *
King Mob: Christopher Hibbert
(Longmans). As the publishers rightly
remind us, Lord George Gordon exists
for most of us as the straw-man in
“Barnaby Rudge”; and this attempt to
bring his strange figure to life again
was long overdue. It is the story of
Lord George, from his first conspicu-
ous public appearance when, as an
“excited and half-naked little boy,” he
shot the King of Poland in the eye
with an arrow, to his death, at 42, as a
Jew; and, in particular, the history of
the Gordon Riots, when, for almost a
week, London was in the hands of the
mob. A vivid chapter deals with the
burning of Langdale’s distillery (Lang-
dale was a Catholic), when the gutters
ran with raw, unrectified gin, eagerly
lapped-up by the mob while others of
the rioters, drunk and incapable,
burned to death in the cellars.

The Book of Leisure: John Pudney
(Odhams). One of those “bedside”
miscellanies which never fail to be
entertaining because of the variety and
richness of the material available to
the compiler; even when, as here, he
asks his contributors for unpublished
writing. Contributors include Eleanor
Farjeon, Arnold Haskell, Compton
Mackenzie, Louis Golding and A. P.
Herbert. Subjects covered, vaguely
indicating ways in which you could
spend your leisure if you wanted to,
include eating steak, making love,
climbing rocks, playing tennis and
gardening. Illustrations are in color
and black-and-white. One notes with
pleasure and mild surprise the name
of Dal Stivens among the contributors,
with a fantasy on space-travel.

He Died Old: Maurice Duggan
(Faber). A biography of Mithradates,
King of Pontus, a great adversary of
me Romans until he was finally
defeated by Pompey. Still fighting in
e xile, he took poison when he was
deposed in favor of his son, and, when
that failed to work, got one of his
officers to cut him down. The
biography, essentially sober and factual,
though rising to some dramatic scenes,
is ingeniously put together from a
variety of sources—Strabo, Appian,
Plutarch and a biography written by
Theodore Reinach in 1890.

Doctor at Stalingrad: Hans Dibold
(Hutchinson). The author, an Austrian
doctor, was attached to the German
Sixth Army, which was surrounded
and annihilated at Stalingrad. He
cared for the wounded in battle, then
afterwards in captivity. The two chief
points he brings out, apart from the
general vivid picture of suffering and
bloodshed, are the debility of the
German soldiers due to exposure and
insufficient vitamins even before they
became prisoners (they died of “prema-
ture senility”) and the frequent under-
standing and sympathy of the individual
Russian doctors with whom he came in
contact.

The Fire of Milan: Riccardo
Bacchelli (Seeker and Warburg). A
novel about the struggles of . a group
of middle-class Milanese to come to
terms with themselves, each other and
the predicament of their society during
the chaotic summer of 1943. A wealthy,
hypersensitive widow, her neurasthenic
son, a Resistance leader and his
mistress take refuge in a country villa
during the Milan air-raids. The mother
and mistress want only to survive the
war without losing their men; the
Resistance leader is torn between love
and patriotism; and the son wants to
do something about everything, but has
lost the will to act. All are finally
enmeshed in the war and destroyed. In
the early chapters much of the drama
is lost in overanalysis of character and
motive; the people never being allowed
to speak for themselves. As if to make
up for this, many of the later chapters
are written like scenes in a play, with
much of the action taking place off-
stage. Both methods make the novel
seem static and abstract. The author
is at his best when shrewdly analysing
the strange political climate of the
time, and in his understanding portrait
of a petty informer and blackmarketeer.
GOLDFISH
Sunlight-red and river-green,
In and out and round and round
From sunken stone to floating leaf
My goldfish rove the lily-pond.
They have no thought except to eat
(The red one chews the water-weed)
Or dart in sudden freaks of play
Clean through the shoal at topmost speed.
They nibble at the feet of wasps,
They prowl for algce in the lilies
Or standing on their heads deep down
Display a flash of silver bellies.
They know my hand that drops them food
Is no black wing of hurt and trouble,
And scorning crane or kookaburra
Up they come and how they gobblel
Then one in frolic swirls his tail,
Pretending fish must not be seen,
And off they dart and fill my pool
With sunlight-red and river-green.
