Panelift door in gold & off-white Colorbond.
It’s cheaper and
better that way.
Lysaght Colorbond provides
manufacturers with a new concept
in steel sheet and coil. Paint first.
Fabricate later.
Colorbond is a premium quality,
factory applied coating onto cold
rolled or zinc coated sheet steel.
No conventional spray or dip process
could ever match its uniformity and
finish at a lower cost.' Paint and
labour costs alone could be greater.
Colorbond is versatile. It can be deep
drawn, roll formed, stamped, press
braked or tiot stamped. The result,
a more attractive product at a lower
cost. A great idea. Use Colorbond
to supplement your own finishing
facilities. Or to raise out-put without
further capital outlay. Colorbond
can save dollars all down the line.

can save you money and improve
your product. Technical advice and

Everyone's up in armchairs...
This is the seat of the rebellion!
To look at them, you’d never believe how warlike
some people can be. But then this is the “after”
picture.
The “before” was the day they heard about the
BOAC Armchair . . . how it has all this stretch-your-
legs-right-out room, and big, big contours all smoth-
ered in foamy soft upholstery. And they were
missing out!
Lavender and old lace just weren’t in it . . . the day
they realised the most comfortable economy class
seat in the world was passing them by.
Now they’re up in Armchairs. Along with just about
everyone else. It’s a lot of fun up there.
Incidentally, BOAC have 10 Armchair flights a week
out of Australia to London and Europe. Seven a
week West via India, three a week East via the
U.S.A.
Why don’t you call your travel agent, BOAC, or
Qantas, General Sales Agents for BOAC, and make
a booking?
When there’s a rising, the most peaceful place is the
seat of the rebellion.

IMPACT
THERE MAY HAVE been some mem-
bers of the public last week who
mistakenly believed that the Duke of
Edinburgh was here to close down the
Commonwealth rather than to open the
third Commonwealth Study Conference.
It would be useless to pretend that he
made much general impact, but that
is probably not what he wants to do.
No one knows better than he that 1968
is not 1954 and in sensible, intelligent
fashion he seems only to want to make
his presence felt in fields in which he
thinks he can work effectively.
However, there was one corner of a
foreign field that was for ever England
and that was David Jones’ shop in
Sydney, which was festooned with
Union Jacks. Trade was once more
following the flag and the shop was in
the midst of a big British promotion to
coincide with the Duke’s visit. And in
between selling soap and Mary Quant
cosmetics there was Lord Brown, Min-
ister of State at the British Board of
Trade, explaining why Britain had
withdrawn east of Suez and assuring us
all that Britain is not yet finished.
SWITCH
THERE HAS BEEN much recent fuss
about Anglicans who admit to being
agnostics. More worrying seem to be
the numbers of agnostics who admit to
believing in God.
THAWING
JUST BACK from a holiday in West
Germany, The Bulletin’s Peter Samuel
heard sufficient eastern European jokes
to believe that Czechoslovakia’s liberal-
isation is loosening more than its own
sense of humor.
The one he liked best is now going
the rounds of East Germany and con-
cerns the fellow who stood up at a
Party meeting in Moscow to ask why,
with so much Soviet support, the Arabs
always did so poorly in their war with
the Jews.
“To the contrary,” answered the
Party secretary. “Our Arab friends have
read their Soviet history well and have
understood it necessary to make a tacti-
cal withdrawal and wait for the snows
to come.”
BACK WITH BECKETT
JACK MacGOWRAN, the Irish actor,
revealed a shadow of his alter ego —
Samuel Beckett scholar extraordinary —•
during his brief stay in Sydney as one
of the cast of “Age of Consent.” But
Australians may be treated to a fuller
study of his interpretations of Beckett’s
work, if MacGowran realises his hope
of bringing his one-man show here next
March.
After he finished his part as a raffish,
down-at-heel Irishman in the Michael
Powell-James Mason film, he found
time to give a seminar on Beckett at
Macquarie University. But this won’t
be his last word to Australians on the
subject if he has his way. Heartened
by letters from as far as New Guinea
and by the fact that all Beckett’s
books were on sale in a bookshop in
Cairns, he is keen to return here with
his show, “Beginning to End,” a two-
hour program which contains extracts
from everything Beckett has ever
written. He has already presented it
in Dublin and will repeat it at the
Mermaid Theatre, London, this year.
MacGowran’s preoccupation with the
work of the Irish-French dramatist dates
back to a role he had in a Beckett
radio play, “All That Fall,” then he
met the playwright himself at the Royal
Court Theatre a year later. At first,
however, the meeting was anything but
propitious.
“There was dead silence. I was in
awe of him, and he was shy. We
talked about Rugby football, and then
we got on to golf he’s got a handi-
cap of four and that broke the
ice, so we could get on to his work.
He’ll never refuse to discuss his work
if it’s being performed, but he shuns
publicity. He says he’d feel superior
to his work, if he tried to explain it.
And it’s not a gimmick to create a
mystery round himself.”
At the time of their first meeting,
Beckett was receiving only limited
recognition. MacGowran says his plays
were being performed badly, and he
remembers half-empty houses for
“Waiting for Godot” in 1956, and an
audience of only four people at “End-
game” in 1958. “That’s changed,
though. I got them to revive ‘End-
game’ four years ago, and we got
packed houses in Paris, at the Aldwych
in London, and at the Nottingham
Playhouse. Now there’s a strong com-
mercial public for him in London and
a lot of support for him in the U.S.
universities.”
Both MacGowran and Beckett were
born in Dublin, a fact which reinforces
the actor’s feeling of affinity with the
playwright, but in explaining the appeal
of Beckett’s work, MacGowran cites
its stoicism and its humor.
“He’s been misrepresented as a
philosopher of despair. People tend to
overlook the comic imagery in his
work. A lot of his philosophy comes
out of his experiences in the French
Resistance during the war.
“There’s a standard Beckett charac-
ter he’s in some sort of stress or
trouble, life treats him in a rough way,
but he’ll never be in such a situation
of despair that he’ll kill himself. Bec-
kett believes self-destruction is the
worst thing of all. He sums it all up
in the last three sentences in ‘The
Unnameable,’ one of his novels ‘I
must go on. I can’t go on. I will go
5 55
on.
MacGowran tries to appear in one
Beckett play a year. He has done “End-
game,” “Waiting for Godot,” Beckett’s
first television play, “Eh Joe?” and
“Embers,” a play written specially for
him. MacGowran explained why Bec-
kett writes in French, then translates
his work into English. “Being Irish,
he’s afraid of falling into the trap of
flowery rhetoric, and he thinks French

and Young Podson (above) have be-
come Brad Morahan (James Mason)
and Nat Kelly (Jack MacGowran) in
the film version of “The Age of Con-
sent”
disciplines his English. He once edited
a 280-page novel down to 18 pages. He
said, ‘I published what I could rescue
from it.’ Writing is agony for him.
The National Theatre once asked him
to do a three-act play, and he told
them he couldn’t. He can’t write to
order.”
In addition to the one-man show,
MacGowran is facing three film possibi-
lities, one of them a production of
“Shadow of a Gunman,” which is to
be filmed by a new company. Until
three years ago, films took a definite
second place to theatre in his list of
preferences. Then he met Roman
Polanski, the young director whose films
include “Knife in the Water,” “Repul-
sion,” “Cul de Sac,” and the latest

“The Vampire Killers,” or, as it is
known rather congenially in America,
“Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are In
My Neck.” MacGowran appears both
in it and in “Cul de Sac.” “Polanski,”
he says, “has excited me about cinema
in the same way as Beckett did about
theatre.”
PUSH-BUTTON PHILOSOPHY
DR. PRESPER ECKERT, vice-presi-
dent of UNIVAC and co-inventor of
the first electronic computer, turned
on the rather tired smile of one who
has been through all this many times
before. No, computers weren’t posing
a serious threat to the workforce in
the United States.
The insurance companies, where the
impact had been strongest, already had
a high turnover in clerical staff because
they’d been hiring young girls who had
a habit of going off and getting married.
So all the companies had to do to
absorb the effects of the computers was
to slow up their hiring over a period
of five years.
Dr. Eckert, in Sydney to launch
UNIVAC’s new series of computers on
the Australian market, added that com-
puters were having a small influence
on a large nu'mber of people—unlike
some attempts at automation.
Eventually, of course, computers
would threaten employment to some
extent, but if you wanted to be really
reactionary about it, you might as well
go all the way and condemn medical
efforts to save lives because they con-
tributed to the population explosion.
We were tempted to tell him about
Sir Macfarlane Burnet, but Dr. Eckert,
the obligatory business over, was now
ready to talk about some of the positive
factors of computers.
Until a few years ago, he said, half
the U.S. workforce was involved in
some kind of paperwork. In other
words, half its time was spent in look-
ing after the work it was doing for the
rest of the time. Computers were neces-
sary if Government planning is to be
able to cope with over-population.
Some of Dr. Eckert’s predictions
about the everyday aspects of the com-
puterland of the not-too-far-distant
future may have a better chance of
breaking down layman suspicions about
machines most people have little hope
of understanding. For instance, we
may be dispensing with the periodic
trauma of receiving a bank statement
by mail in favor of bookkeeping by
telephone.
“This will work on the push-button
phones we already have in the States.
You’ll be able to use the dial to enter
information into a computer. For
example, after going shopping you
could enter everything you bought.
This could go into your bank, and you
could call up again and have the
balance read back to you. I don’t
know when that will happen, though,
because there are more urgent prob-
lems, like the use of computers in
hospitals.
“There’s talk about building equip-
ment designed to take constant read-
ings on patients—tiny thermometers,
instruments to record heart-beats, and
so on. They’d all feed their informa-
tion into a computer. This wouldn’t
do away with the chart at the end
of the bed—just make the records more
elaborate, perhaps with comparisons
with the patient’s past history.”
Dr. Eckert was a scientist at the
University of Pennsylvania when he and
another scientist, John W. Mauchly,
began work on ENIAC, the first all-
electric computer, in 1943. He’d grown
up in Philadelphia and Science was his
subject long before university.
“We originally began building the
computer because the Army wanted an
instrument to calculate the trajectories
of guns. The guns being used in
Africa weren’t firing properly because
they’d been tested in America and in
Africa the ground was too springy for
them.
“They were using a big mechanical
thing for calculating, but it couldn’t
handle the job. Then they trained 300
girls to use desk calculators, but that
was no good, either, so they thought
they’d try electronics. But by the time
we finished the computer the war was

When it’s shivering cold and your office becomes an
igloo, your factory little Antarctica, your
staff slows down. That’s bad. Bad for production
and bad for profits. What to do? Insulate with
SISALATION heat-reflecting aluminium
foil insulation.
Inexpensive Sisalation keeps winter out and slashes
fuel bills up to 40%. It also makes summers 15
degrees cooler. Think what the extra comfort means
in terms of improved productivity. Everyone works
better because they’re comfortable and happy.
Install fire-resistant Sisalation 450 in new or existing
buildings, in the roof and walls and it will work for
you 24 hours a day without pay. Not only will it
reflect radiant heat, but it protects you from leaking
roofs and storm damage because it’s tough, weather-
proof. Left exposed as a ceiling surface its high
reflectivity improves light distribution.
Sisalation 450 has qualities no other foil can match.
It’s guaranteed fire-resistant for life and is double-
reinforced for optimum strength and durability.
A proven method of efficient insulation, Sisalation
450 is used extensively in factories, schools, ware-
houses, and in cold stores operating at sub-zero tem-
peratures.

Daphne Guinness
A FINE STYLE OF
TRUMPETING
THE OLD COUNTRY
ISN’T IT marvellous, everyone says,
grinding up on escalators past bath-
towels on the first floor, through corsets,
non-shrink woollens, thigh boots, kiddies’
cardigans, right up to David Jones’ cul-
tural seventh floor. How well DJ’s have
organised this Britain ’6B show, especi-
ally the Winston Churchill bit, so life-
like daubing away there in a pin-stripe
suit and ten-gallon hat. Actually no,
says Sir Charles Johnston, British High
Commissioner and tonight’s host, he
didn’t participate in this show person-
ally, his staff did, but he wishes he’d
thought of Winston Churchill. “Did
you know that’s an original Churchill
painting?” asks Lady Johnston, “they
said so in the newspapers.”
There have been British weeks at
DJ’s all over Australia since early April,
but this party is special. Lord Brown,
Minister of State at the British Board
of Trade, is here to trumpet the Old
Country, and a thousand people are
invited to hear him. What shocked DJ’s
management was people ringing up ask-
ing for invitations; they didn’t think
that sort of thing happened these days.
“Confidentially,” says Lord Brown, “it’s
damn’d hard work. Flew non-stop from
London. Got here 9 a.m. On the job at
3 p.m.” Thank God he kept to apples
and cheese on the flight. It’s all that
over-eating that exhausts people, don’t
you know.
So here everyone is in after-six mink
and pearls and starched shirts, and there
is Lord Brown, crumpled in that aris-
tocratic British fashion, fiddling with
his navy gold-crested Export Credit
Guarantee Department tie and asking
a Customs and Excise man why is it
Australia won’t buy British aeroplanes.
Lady Lloyd Jones and Charles are
standing by the Crown Jewels at the
top of the seventh - floor stairs.
“Charles,” says someone, waving at the
Union Jacks hanging everywhere, “I
suppose all these flags came off your
cars?” “No,” replies Charles, “but the
hats,” referring to Crowns Scottish, St.
Edwards and Imperial State, “the hats
are all mother’s.” Of course, they’re
all saying, it would rain. How very
British, was that organised, too? And
trudge through with dripping um-
brellas and macs. The furs stay put,
despite the rising temperature.
The form is to mingle a while round
the jools, padlocked against sudden
temptation, accept a cigarette from a
Dunhill girl packaged like her product
in maroon, gaze awhile upon the Llovd-
Jones, Lord Brown, the Johnstons, and
utter social cries of pleasure, because
for one thing this is where the Press
are taking down names, and for another
no one wants to be the first at the
grog. Which is down the stairs where
the restaurant normally is. Peter Lloyd-
Jones didn’t know that. He hasn’t
been in the store lately. Anyway,
Charles breaks the ice and soon every-
one’s milling around saying where does
one get a drink and how healthy
British people look tonight. Sheila
Scotter, “Vogue’s” editor, says she feels
Australian in her black-and-white Nor-
ma Tullo as featured on some page
or other in this month’s issue. She
can’t remember which page, gosh, she
can’t know everything. D’you know
friends ring up and complain their
subscription hasn’t come through, she’s
not the subscription department, though
they seem to think she is. Surely Hugh
Birch of Qantas has the same pro'blem
with friends over tickets? Huh, he says,
that’s nothing to the man from Lov-
able: he has women coming up to him
at parties baring their bosoms and
complaining about shrinkage of C cups.
There’s actor John McCallum, a vision
in London-fog grey, waving across the
room. Interior decorator Leslie Wal-
ford divested of his Australian strangled
look jacket and turtle shirt, tonight in
something looser, discusses suede with
a Quant cosmetician. The other Quant
boy is over the room with the Aus-
tralian boss’s daughter. The Press here
is awful, he didn’t say Adelaide girls
were dull, he said they were un-
interesting. What? No, he “doesn’t feel
a fool dressed like a Regency buck.
It’s all instant Regency buck, actually,
the frilled jabot and cuffs are on
elastic and come off for easy washing.
Oh yes, the boss’s daughter cries, she
knows, just like made-up evening bows.
Mr. Jantzen is here. Mr. Formfit is
here. So is Mr. Revlon with a North
Pole handerchief. Mrs. Revlon is wear-
ing a gold lame trenchcoat.
This, really, is the biggest party at
DJ’s since the State Banquet for the
Queen 14 years ago. It doesn’t rate the
attendance of Prime Minister Mr. Gor-
ton or N.S.W. Premier Mr. Askin, but,
never mind, their representatives are
here, Federal Minister for Labor and
National Service Mr. Bury, and N.S.W.
Minister for Decentralisation and De-
velopment Mr. Fuller, and that’s not bad.
Anyway, the speeches are bound to be
good. There is sudden movement on the
dais. Sir Charles Johnston with Lord
Brown and Charles Lloyd-Jones appear
through the gladioli and chrysanthe-
mums. Sir Charles says he is honored to

Good night for shoplifting, everyone
says, sinking slowly back through kid-
dies’ cardigans, thigh boots, non-shrink
woollens, corsets, and bath-towels. And,
actually, in full view of three store
detectives, a group of guests dive on to
the scent counter and spray Faberge for
men over themselves.
Management say this party gives a
wonderful kick-off to the store’s 130th
birthday promotion next month. Then
customers will really benefit.

YOU, TOO, CAN SPEAK
IMPERFECT GERMAN
(ADVANCED COURSE)
A FEW YEARS ago, ashamed of my
ignorance of the German language, I
set about learning it by the teach-your-
self method. I reached the stage where
I could translate the sentence: “I do
not like Leader of Reich Womanhood
Scholtz-Klink and she cannot play my
bagpipes.” It came out: Ich liebe nicht
Reichsfrauenfuehrerin Scholtz - Klink
und sie kann nicht mein Dudelsack
spielen. I was impressed by the rich-
ness of the language in bossy words
(Achtung, Schweinhund! Unter Peri-
skop!) and funny words (like Gesch-
mack for taste and Strumpf for stock-
ing).
The disadvantage of the teach-
yourself method of learning is that one’s
teacher is not strict enough. When I
failed to do my German homework I
did not give myself a detention or
caning. As a result my German studies
prematurely ceased.
Lately, however, I have made pro-
gress again, through the unexpected
help of the British Toy Manufacturers’
Association. This excellent body pub-
lished a special issue of its magazine
“British Toys” to promote members’
exhibits at the Nuremberg Toy Fair. It
described the toys in German and Eng-
lish, and I had a shot at reading the
German.
The task was hard at first, and I
grasped gratefully at familiar words. I
was glad to see the Fuzzy Felt people
offering a set which featured Pooh Der
Bar. Mettoy Playcraft’s models of fic-
tional heroes, or Fantasie-Helden, in-
cluded Batman und der Mann von
Onkel. Another firm sold kraftige Wild
West Pistolen und Polizeirevolvern. So
far so good.
One noticed that as soon as toy
weapons were mentioned the German
language seemed to get into top gear.
The description of Das Super Bang
Gewehr (gun) sounded like von
Moltke barking instructions to von
Rundstedt: Es ist mit einem kraftige
Schiessmechanismus, einem Stahllauf,
und einem Aufbrechsystem fur einfaches
Laden der Kapseln. (“It has a strong
firing mechanism, steel barrel, and
break-open action for easy loading of
caps.”) Jawohl, Herr General!
A different note was sounded by C.
and S. Stone Ltd., who specialise in
Christmas tree decorations, or Christ-
baumschmuck. Their products trans-
ported one to the atmosphere of carols
and Santa Claus. They sold silvery
tinsel, called Flittersilber; you could
also get long strings of it known as
Flittergirlanden. Not to mention their
well-known Glitterpulver (gold pow-
der).’ The folksy word Schmuck, mean-
ning ornament, occurred again in Cheryl
Playthings’ advertisement for Wigwams
und indianischer Kopfschmuck (head-
dresses).
I was a little puzzled when a mech-
anical-toy firm said their Kollektion in-
cluded some Dampfwalzen. They
sounded like damp waltzers perhaps
a pair of besotted lovers who waltzed in
the rain. I learned on further inquiry
that Dampf was steam and Walzen
meant rollers, so the things were steam-
rollers. The word waltz was originally
the German verb “to roll,” so waltzing
is closer to rock-and-roll than one might
have thought.
The products of D. G. Todd Ltd.
brought one to the charming world of
Die Puppen (dolls). An appealing line
was die Choosy Susie, eine Babypuppe
mit magnetische Augen (magnetic
eyes), which closed when she drank from
a bottle. The same enterprising firm
made eine grosse trinkende und nass-
ende Puppe (a large drinking and wet-
ting doll), which sounded like a sure
hit for the German market*
The carefree formation of compound
words is an ever-fascinating feature of
German. Surprisingly the language has
no simple word for toy, but uses
Spielzeug (play-stuff). A squeaking toy
is a Quietschspielzeug. An ambulance is
a Krankenwagen (sick-carriage). For
those who like eine kleine Popmusik,
Chad Valley Ltd. makes the Swingster
Plattenspieler (record-player), on
which one can play a favorite hit, or
Lieblingschlager. The latter literally
means darling-hit, and I nominate it
as German word of the week.
Study of this little publication has
much improved my German vocabulary,
albeit within a restricted field. I can
cut a respectable figure, if the occasion
should arise, as a German Father
Christmas, mit mein indianischer
Kopfschmuck und Flitter silber, mein
Super Bang Gewehr, mein Choosy
Susie Baby puppe, und mein Platten-
spieler zu spielen Lieblingschlager. It
should be great fun until I am taken
off in the Krankenwagen.

Now Wridgways introduce‘Home Pack’containers
so you don’t have to move in glass houses.
The old way was:
The removalist’s van called. Your furniture
was carted out (and sometimes sorted on the
lawn) and loaded.
Then, if you wanted it stored, it was unloaded
from the van and earned into a warehouse.
When you ultimately wanted it delivered, it
was again carted from the warehouse and
loaded into the van. Sometimes, like in a move
from Melbourne to Brisbane, your furniture
might be transhipped unloaded in Sydney
and shifted 'to another van going to Brisbane.
A lot of public viewing.
And a lot of handling. And exposure to dust,
moths, silverfish, pilferers.
Wridgways’ new ‘Home Pack’ Containers end
all that.
At your home, all of your furniture, all your
belongings, are locked into a sealed ‘Home
Pack’ container, there, before your eyes. Now
Wridgways will do what you like with it. Store
it. Deliver it to its destination* Privately. And
more importantly, safely.
No dust. No mildew. No moths or silverfish.-
No pilferers. And ‘Home Pack’ moving and
storing is just as economical as “the old way”.
So now you don’t have to move in a glass
house. But we still handle all your belongings
as if they were glass.
‘Home Pack’Containers are operating now
between Melbourne and Sydney and will be
introduced progressively to all states.

Students in search
of a role
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
IT IS NOT an accident that the central
core of this month’s student rioters in
France, West Germany, and Italy is
made up of Arts students. There are all
kinds of other reasons why students riot,
but one of them is that impelling sense
of “alienation” that comes from those
who are wondering how on earth they
can get a job they will like. In modern
industrial nations, among the university
educated, this particular anxiety is the
particular concern of Arts students.
Those students for whom their tertiary
training is more obviously related to
future employment can also have their
fling. The natural tendency of students
toward turmoil in the streets, reinforced
in continental European countries by
political tradition, can easily make sense
to even a student technologist because
Continental European students have so
many convincing complaints against
their universities. It is true that if such
a student lives in one of the poor coun-
tries he may be as uncertain as the Arts
students about how he is going to fit in
when he graduates; but in a prosperous
industrial nation he can have his fun,
and then settle down to “conforming.”
He does not carry a fire in his heart for
Trotsky, Che Guevara, Mao Tse Tung,
or Ho Chi Minh.
But what happens to the student of,
say, sociology or philosophy or political
science when he graduates? Apart from
the universities and school, who is going
to give him a job that is related to his
academic studies? Those who have not
experienced it (which is to say most
people) cannot understand the anguishes
that can overcome a student who is
following lines of interest that he knows
will soon be taken from him, when he
will then be expected to play a part in
a society that does not seem to have any
part for him to play. When to this are
added the anguishes of the present con-
dition of the traditional side of Western
culture —its scepticism, the collapse of
its pride and confidence, its compen-
satory bombast —it is extraordinary that
rebelliousness is so restrained. (Perhaps
this is a tribute to the basic insensitivity
of most Arts students, whose anguish
can be confined to realising that they
may be going to miss out on the best
jobs.)
What is going to happen to Arts
faculties? Their role was unquestioned
when their function was to diffuse a
common and assured culture among the
aristocracy and the gentry and, later,
to a rich bourgeoisie. In those countries
where a “non-specialist” education (viz.
specialism in Arts subjects) was taken
to be a sufficient basis for a good job
the universities became part of the basic
structure of the State if there were
enough jobs to go round. But now that
there is more demand that men should
be trained during their tertiary educa-
tion in the techniques they will use in
their jobs, will Arts faculties (apart
from teacher trainees) end up being
stocked mainly by women? There are
signs already that the “humanities” side
of Western culture, when it is not given
over to a stylised anguish, is develop-
ing a split market some safe sub-
culture for educated housewives, and
some survey results for academic
technicians.
Although the present fashion in
student power grew out of America,
it is in America, paradoxically, that the
problem of the Arts student is less
acute. Student protests in America
shared two characteristics with Western
Europe’s but not a third. Like the
Western European students, although
for different reasons, American students
also tend to get fed up with the ad-
ministration of their universities; and,
like the Western European students,
some American students (not many,
perhaps, but the articulate ones) want
some new framework of hope and action
to replace the old. But they do not
have the same problem with jobs as
the Western Europeans. America has
broken free from the elitism of the
Western European universities: the
great mish-mash of tertiary education
in America allows both for the com-
bination of special training with some
general humanities education and for
the putting off of final vocational
choice for the talented until the
quaternary stage. In addition, American
organisational life has been much more
experimental in its recruiting methods
than the Western Europeans: there are
more jobs for educated people (or
half-educated people).
Is there any real solution to the
questions involved within the present
framework of educational administra-
tion and cultural traditions, of Western
Europe? The affluent societies of the
future may finally have to detach those
“subjects” that are concerned with the
diagnosis of humanity from the whole
complex of examinations, vocational
training, and job-getting, giving them a
different status and approach, so that
culture, while still a characteristic of
a civilisation, is not an examination
subject and is not expected to bear
any necessary relation to getting on
in life. The alternative is something
seen as a technocratic society in which
the active parts of Western culture
thrive while the traditional obsessions
are desiccated into technical academic
rituals. But that does not seem pos-
sible. The traditional obsessions are
still real enough. They won’t dry out.
If the academic world cannot give new
meaning to them, they will blow up.

When the DLP
calls the tune
ONE OF THE major political criti-
cisms levelled against the late Mr. Holt
was that he failed to pay the Demo-
cratic Labor Party the respect which
was its due by virtue of its cold
political power. While he was con-
stantly bending over backwards to
satisfy the Country Party, he seemed
unable to perceive the DLP as a real
political force of comparable strength.
And so he was led into dismal defeats
and humiliations in Parliament
through the Telephone Charges Bill,
and the prolonged VIP planes affair.
“That is one mistake John Gorton
won’t make,” his supporters said around
the time of the succession struggle in
January. The expectation was fair
enough. Gorton had urged his ministerial
colleagues to make it a practice to clear
doubtful proposals with the DLP be-
fore introducing them into the Parlia-
ment, so that the Government would
not run the risk of defeat. And he
maintained excellent personal relations
with the DLP Senators.
But since assuming Prime Minister-
ship he seems to have fallen into the
ways that misled Mr. Holt, but perhaps
even more seriously. He has done this
on one large issue and one relatively
small one. The relatively small one was
the amendment to the National Service
legislation.
This was an astonishing exercise from
the beginning. It is common for
governments to find they need to
amend legislation in order to make it
work, but not for them to introduce
amendments into Parliament out of the
blue. In the case of the home savings
grants amendments or changes in
income tax legislation, to take two
examples of what is common practice,
the Government let it be known before-
hand that it needed to alter the law
to overcome unforeseen difficulties in
administering it. But, in this case, since
there has never been the slightest hint
from the Government that it was having
difficulty administering National Ser-
vice, it was understandable that so
many people were taken aback by the
amendments when they were introduced
and were initially suspicious of them.
The requirement that parents inform
on their wayward children and that
professional men be required to betray
information given in confidence was
clearly outrageous. In the ordinary
course erf tracking down people com-
mitting more serious offences against
society than draft-dodging (bashings or
murder, for instance) we do not need
to grant the State these sort of powers.
The police have to find people they
want for questioning even though
families and friends refuse to disclose
their whereabouts. The Taxation
Department has to try to pick up
people not sending in their tax forms.

COMMENT
BY
PETER
SAMUEL
They have their methods of finding tax-
dodgers and the Department of Labor
and National Service had better find
its methods of tracing draft-dodgers.
The private reply to this, given by
Government spokesmen, is that there is
an organised campaign to encourage and
help people dodge the draft. But most
of the activity of these groups seems to
be analogous to that of tax consul-
tants, to help their clients avoid tax
legally by taking full advantage of the
tax legislation.
Obviously, in fairness to those who
follow the law and face conscription,
the Government has an obligation to
make a serious effort to track down
draft-dodgers, but it has made no case
for the extraordinary powers it pro-
posed in its initial legislation. This was
where the DLP came in. It managed
to get rid of the worst elements of the
National Service legislation by threaten-
ing to block them in the Senate.
Incidentally, it is a pity the oppor-
tunity was not taken to reform and
liberalise the provisions for con-
scientious objection. At a time when
only one in four people of conscript
age is needed for the Armed Forces
it is surely wrong to apply such strong
tests against conscientious objection. To
put it in very practical terms, the Army
simply does not want young men who
feel strongly that its task is wrong. And
if young men felt they had a fair chance
to prove objection of conscience, they
would be less likely to become so reck-
less as to opt out of the whole system
and avoid registration.
Mr. Gorton should pay more atten-
tion to how the DLP holders of power
in the Senate forced his Government to
change its draft-dodging legislation. It
could also have relevance to the great
issues of defence and foreign policy
which now face the country. In this
connection, one of the most under-
reported statements of the year was
made by the DLP’s Senator McManus
at a seminar on Vietnam last weekend.
Commenting on Mr. Gorton’s sugges-
tion at a Government Members’ Party
meeting that Australia might abandon
forward defence in Asia, McManus said:
“That sounds more like the policy of
Dr. Cairns than of the Liberal Govern-
ment. It envisages the collapse of the
collective defence of South-East Asia
and Australia. The Government won
elections because the people believed
its foreign and defence policies were
realistic . . . many electors will no
longer see the need to vote for the
Government if its policies are almost
indistinguishable from those of the
ALP.”
This is the larger issue on which Mr.
Gorton appears to be unwisely neglect-
ing the power of the DLP.

AUSTRALIA
A Prime Minister in search
of six Presidents
MR. GORTON DEPARTS for the
United States this week on one of the
strangest missions undertaken by an
Australian Prime Minister. He goes
to talk to a retiring President and (he
hopes) to six campaigners for the suc-
cession.
He goes—so his official spokesmen
say —to find out whether the United
States is going to maintain a military
presence in Asia, how the next U.S.
Administration is likely to view the
commitment of Australian troops to
Malaysia, and specifically whether it
will underwrite them by a guarantee of
backing in the event of fighting.
With the Presidential campaigning
moving into top gear, Mr. Gorton is
going to find the candidates difficult
fellows to extract much sense from.
They are these days measuring every
word for its impact on American public
opinion. They do not need to have a
care for its implications for American
foreign policy. They are in no position
to give any assurances, and in any case
each of them knows that it is possible
to say one thing now and do a quite
different thing later as President.
Perhaps Mr. Gorton realised all this.
At one stage it was said on his behalf
that after President Johnson’s March
31 statement that he was standing down
he had decided not to go. But the
President insisted, so Mr. Gorton is still
going.
The trip could, nevertheless, be use-
ful to him. If he acts in the right way,
it could bring him some prestigious
publicity by association with President
Johnson. (If he acts in the wrong
way it could, of course, do him more
harm than good.) And it could provide
him with additional weaponry for his
fights in Cabinet and the Government
parties for his line on Australian de-
fence policy. He will be able to put
up a line that he has just been to the
U.S., met and talked to the candidates,
and tested the American mood. How
far this will carry him, of course, is
problematic. Cabinet Ministers can
read newspapers and know as much
about the American mood as Mr. Gor-
ton is likely to learn on an official visit.
And there is the terrible possibility
for Mr. Gorton that he may make a
disastrous mistake. It is true that
Americans are re-examining the kind
of role they are playing in the world.
But this does not mean that they will
necessarily become isolationist (which
is, for America, almost impossible), but
that they will be more selective about
whom they back. An Australia de-
manding guarantees may not look as
good as an Australia taking indepen-
dent, responsible action.
What may most appeal to the
Americans is an Australia that is not
prepared to let its regional environ-
ment rot away through lack of collective
defence and economic aid, and that sees
no alternative but to take some inde-
pendent action.
This is not, however, the Gorton
way. Mr. Gorton seems to start from
the assumption that Australia is a small
power. His next proposition appears to
be that small powers do not count (not
even, apparently, with powers smaller
than themselves). He then draws what
is at present the unwarrantable
inference that America is giving all of
South-East Asia away at once, and
therefore concludes that Australia
should turn away from the part of the
world in which it lives and simply hope
for the best, putting its money into
pensions and uneconomic dams.
Some of the Americans Mr. Gorton
meets may try to shock him out of
this happy-go-lucky posture, but it is
just as likely that they will not try.
They may not wish to affront Mr. Gor-
ton personally, preferring to deal
through their State Department with the
Australian External Affairs Department.
Unfortunately, Mr. Gorton tends to
regard the External Affairs Department
with the distrust with which, it is
becoming clear, he regards most of the
rest of the Public Service, and, indeed,
much of his own Cabinet.
President Johnson is said by some to
be most concerned these days to drum
up the numbers for the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty. Whatever happens
at Paris between now and the end of his
term, he is not going to get much credit
for Vietnam. But he would like to go
down in the history books as a man
who got disarmament moving and,
having succeeded with the ban on
atmospheric testing early in his term,
he would like to cap off his disarma-
ment record wfith a treaty banning the
spread of nuclear weapons. The Aus-
tralian Cabinet is still deeply divided
over how Australia should vote on the
treaty, which is now being debated in
the United Nations. India is not signing
it, Pakistan is not, either, and Japan
is most reluctant. If Australia were to
refuse, this might alienate Washington
even more than dilly-dallying about
responsibilities in Malaysia and Singa-
pore.
“The Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty is now a bigger issue in
Washington than Vietnam,” one senior
official said in Canberra last week. He,
at least, was of the opinion that John-
son would talk NPT more than Vietnam
or South-East Asia when Mr. Gorton
visited him. That might at least save
Mr. Gorton from saying one kind of
wrong thing.
The Prime Minister with Emperor Haile Selassie last week...a lesson in how a
VIP on tour can achieve the unexpected


The Public Service
Shaking the clique
ONE OF Mr. Gorton’s main accom-
plishments in government so far has
been to shake up the little clique of
top public servants in Canberra. This
was first manifested in the ouster of
Sir John Bunting, head of Mr. Gorton’s
own Prime Minister’s Department, and
his replacement by Mr. L. Hewitt, the
former Treasury man who had been
with Mr. Gorton as chairman of the
Australian Universities Commission.
That operation was not nearly as neat
as the Prime Minister had hoped and
the result was the creation of a new
department, Cabinet Secretariat.
Hewitt’s installation was bitterly
opposed by most other departmental
heads, who through their Ministers
exerted considerable pressure on Mr.
Gorton to abandon his plans. And the
Prime Minister soon found that the
Chairman of the Public Service Board,
Sir Frederick Wheeler, was working
very closely with Sir John Bunting to
preserve the status quo.
This was undoubtedly one of the
factors in Mr. Gorton’s latest move in
the Public Service, the appointment of
Mr. B. McFarlane to the number-two
position on the Public Service Board.
McFarlane, as secretary of the Depart-
ment of Air, co-operated closely with
Mr. Gorton at the time of the VIP
planes affair last year, and is highly
regarded by the Prime Minister.
In Canberra, it is widely assumed
that McFarlane will succeed Sir Fred-
erick Wheeler when his term expires
in 1970, a development which would
finally break up the group of admin-
istrators who have collectively run the
Canberra Public Service for almost a
■decade.
There is, of course, criticism that
personal and political preferences are
being introduced. But increasingly Min-
isters demand departmental heads who
suit them and there is bound in the
future to be greater mobility at the
top —even if the Australian Public Ser-
vice does not go as far as to adopt
American practice of bringing in
people from outside the Govern-
ment service to top positions (though
Sir Hugh Ennor’s appointment to
head Education and Science is a lone
example). But that would be a logical
development if Mr. Gorton is serious
about stirring the public service.
Meanwhile, there has been a remark-
able loss of top talent at the Department
of Trade and Industry. With the
resignation of Mr. W. Callaghan, head
of the Office of Secondary Industry
(half of the Department almost), three
second-rung men have gone in six
months. And during that time a whole
collection of middle-level men have
departed. Each will have had his
individual motives, but many have left
because of the doubtful future of the
Department.
Even with as powerful a man as
Mr. McEwen as Minister, the De-
partment has not performed well.
Its essays in economic planning
the motor industry scheme is the most
noted example have been most un-
successful. Its role as a secretariat
for the Country Party (Department
officers prepared most of the CP’s
election material in 1966), its con-
frontations with the Tariff Board on
tariff matters, and its intervention into
the areas of responsibility of other
Departments, have left it demoralised.
Woomera-S alisbury
The pay-off
BRITAIN’S MINISTER of State for
Technology, Mr. John Stonehouse,
■seemed anxious in his visit to Canberra
last week to stress the mutual benefits
of collaboration with Australia in such
things as advanced electronics, com-
puters, and aircraft production.
“We want to extend the hand of
technological friendship to Australia—
but we want an economic pay-off for
our investment” was the crux of his
message. But his talk of collaboration
seemed somewhat incongruous when it
appeared that one of the reasons for his
Canberra visit was that Britain wanted
to opt out of its joint operation with
Australia of the Weapons Research
Establishment at Salisbury in South
Australia.
The Salisbury laboratories are part
of the Woomera Rocket Range com-
plex which Britain and Australia have
operated jointly since 1946. The British
financial contribution to the joint
Woomera - Salisbury operation this
financial year is $12.3 million.
Although Britain has decided to remain
in Woomera —at least for another four
years—and share the cost equally with
Australia, the decision to withdraw
from Salisbury will mean an annual
saving for the British Treasury of be-
tween $2 million and $3 million.
Result: the Australian Government
will now take over full control of Salis-
bury operations (although British firms
such as Hawker Dynamics will stay on)
and intends to reorganise to cater for
the needs of the Australian forces.
Emphasis will be placed on advanced
electronics, micro-circuitry techniques,
data transmission, radar, and com-
puters. These techniques will be needed
by the Australian Army in its joint
development with the United States
Army of the multi-million-dollar
Mallard satellite communications
system.
In the meantime, the British absence
from Salisbury will probably mean
that no new British rockets will be
coming up through the hopper. Stone-
house agreed last week that operations
at Woomera might “run down” after
the end of the new four-year agree-
ment in 1972. Britain’s need for rocket-
range facilities after this was uncer-
tain and would depend on what new
rockets it decided to develop.
Queensland, teachers
One emergency leads to another
LAST FRIDAY, Premier Pizzey flew
off to join Federal Trade Minister Mc-
Ewen at the international sugar con-
ference in Europe, leaving Liberal
Leader Mr. Chalk to act as Premier
and deal with Queensland’s 10,000
nettled teachers, who had voted five-
to-one to boycott the Government’s
“emergency teachers scheme” in a
ballot ordered by the State Industrial
Commission. Their view was that,
in recruiting 47 variously qualified
men and women, giving them an eight-
week crash training course, and feed-
ing them into the secondary schools
system, the Government had tried to
meet a long-foreseeable shortage of
teachers in the worst possible way.
The Government’s view was that it
had made a sensible attempt, however
little and however late, to give a
rocketing number of secondary
school students the necessary educa-
tion.
The teachers, led by their newly
elected president, Mr. E. A. Baldwin,
said they were not trying to be diffi-
cult, but when the 47 came into the
schools last week to teach for 26 weeks
under “supervision” it would mean in-
tolerable added strain for those who
had to supervise them—as well as carry
on their normal teaching duties. The
union instructed headmasters to, in
effect, boycott the trainees. The Gov-
eminent countered this move with new
regulations giving the Director General
of Education power to act in place of
principals and head teachers, enabling
departmental inspectors to assign work
to the trainees and supervise them,
But with the trainees at schools widely
separated, and inspectors few, the
week ended with trainees beginning to
teach without adequate supervision,
The union seemed have st r
, , f
grounds than ever for asserting its
& . . °
earlier position - that the trainees
would be acceptable to their fellow
teachers only after one Whole year of
study at a Teachers’ College, that this


Baldwin. .. further moves?
was dilution enough when the Teachers’
Union was campaigning for a higher,
not a lower, standard of qualification
for secondary teachers. This point
impinged on a broader issue affecting
Australian teachers generally, and had
brought Mr. Baldwin to Sydney during
the week for consultation with Aus-
tralian Teachers’ Federation officials,
who possibly feared the spread of
“emergency” schemes to other States.
New South Wales was becoming
critically short of teachers, too.
Baldwin reported on the overall posi-
tion to a Queensland Teachers’ Union
executive meeting last Friday night,
when possible next moves in the dis-
pute were discussed for three hours. No
firm decision resulted, but Baldwin
said that “further moves might be
initiated” within days “to bring the
dispute to a climax.” He handed
reporters an executive resolution
which placed on record that the Union
had been receiving a growing number
Pizzey...off to Europe
of telephone calls from parents who
supported the teachers’ stand. This
attitude was also showing up in par-
ents’ letters to the Press.
Although the Queensland teachers
had only voted to boycott the “emer-
gency scheme” and its trainees, the
results of the voting had been lodged
with the State Industrial Commission.
A strike of all Queensland teachers
was possible. Much would depend this
week on the Government’s next moves,
and in that, much could depend on
whether the Liberal Deputy Premier,
Mr. Chalk, would be making the
decisions, or whether they would be
left to acting Minister Richter. A
teachers’ strike, or a move to end the
stalemate, and the cause of the dispute,
might depend on the decisions of
politicians vigorously “sniffing the
wind” this week.
External Affairs
Acting for N.Z.?
A NEW ZEALANDER who was in
Manila last Anzac Day encountered a
strange gap in his country’s diplomatic
representation: attending a ceremony at
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with
another New Zealander, he saw the
Australian Ambassador arrive to lay a
wreath, looked for one from New
Zealand, and observed the British
Military Attache preserving his British
phlegm—and his place in the assembly,
despite the obvious fact that something
more seemed to be expected of him.
The New Zealander was told later
that for many years the British Mili-
tary Attache in Manila, or his deputy,
had represented New Zealand at the
ceremony but had omitted the gesture
in 1967 because someone in the British
Embassy in Hong Kong had omitted to
send the routine instructions to Manila
that year. Perhaps he had some doubt
as to whether or not the omission was
part of the coming pull-out. So, in
1968, a New Zealand businessman in
Manila had paid for a. wreath and had
it delivered to the British Attache, who,
unfortunately, forgot to bring it with
him.
This strange tale, coupled with a
note in a recent New Zealand External
Affairs Department article on trans-
Tasman relations, suggesting a gradual
informal extension of areas of co-
operation between Australia and New
Zealand, led The Bulletin to wonder
whether it might not be much more
sensible for Australia to represent New
Zealand in Manila and many similar
places.
New Zealand has a competent but
very limited diplomatic service (350
officers in 24 posts, compared to 1700
Australian officers at 56 posts). In
the 60-odd countries where New
Zealand has no mission, its Ambassa-
dor in a neighboring country is usually
accredited as its representative, but its
consular and administrative work are
done by the British. And political
reporting is done in close co-operation
with the British, too.
In a number of countries in South-
East Asia the Australian Embassy could
take over from the British. British
budgetary restraints on the one hand,
and the growth of Australian diplomatic
service, mean that in many cases the
Australian mission is better suited than
the British to act on behalf of New
Zealand. In Korea. Laos, and the
Philippines, where New Zealand has
no mission, Australia could much more
effectively act on her behalf than
Britain. With all these countries our
relations are far closer than Britain’s
and the trend must be for our missions
in these countries to expand. Britain,
on the other hand, withdrawing from
the area and restricting, for balance of
payments reasons, the growth of its
Foreign Service will inevitably swing
less diplomatic weight.
In the South Pacific there is probably
plenty of room for more joint action-
In Fiji, for instance, the New Zealand
Government has no mission and is
represented by the firm of Carpenter
and Company.
The British would probably be
pleased to be relieved of the burden
of handling New Zealand matters in
these posts, and co-operation between
Australia and New Zealand would
inevitably become closer.
The Task, Force
A new role, with
the Americans
SINCE OCTOBER last year a number
of events have combined to completely
transform the character of Australian
military operations in Vietnam. Since
he arrived in Vietnam, Australian Task
Force commander Brigadier Ron
Hughes has spent more time conducting
operations from an American head-
quarters base in Bien Hoa province
than from the nominal base at Nui Dat,
in the Australian province of Phuoc
Tuy.
Except for a spell of a few weeks in
March and April, the bulk of Austra-
lian troops have been deployed outside
their tactical area of responsibility in
combined operations with the Ameri-
cans. The pattern of independent opera-
tions within Phuoc Tuy has not been
completely abandoned, but it has been
radically de-emphasised since October.
The “Fence,” a ten-mile barrier of
barbed wire and mines, intended to
keep the Viet Cong out of the areas
of population so that in combination
with vigorous patrolling and police
work the province could be pacified,
has virtually been abandoned as a seri-
ous military obstacle. Elements of the
Viet Cong D 445 regional battalion and


guerilla squads have been able to move
with ease between jungle bases and the
populated areas of Phuoc Tuy as Aus-
tralian effort has been concentrated in
Bien Hoa province to the north.
It is partly a change in command.
Former Task Force commander Briga-
dier John Stuart Graham developed the
emphasis on pacification and the policy
which laid emphasis on the “fence” and
police-type activities to isolate the Com-
munists from the people. He was
critical of the value of massive Ameri-
can-style sweeps: “If we can keep the
Viet Cong out in the jungle, away from
the people, I firmly believe that he will
wither on the vine,” he was quoted as
Hughes
Graham
saying in an Army Press release just
before his departure in mid-October.
But Brigadier Hughes, who took over,
was far more willing to fit in with
American-style operations of relentlessly
pursuing the Viet Cong right out in the
jungle. Immediately on taking com-
mand, the troops went out on Santa Fe,
an essentially American operation in the
far north-east mountains of Phuoc Tuy.
Not long after it ended, they teamed
with the Americans again in Operation
Coburg, which took them out of Phuoc
Tuy to Bien Hoa province into the top-
level Communist jungle base called
Zone D.
They were there the best part of three
months. They played a valuable role
in hampering the Communist TET
offensive, by blocking and destroying
several substantial Communist units
marching on the long Bin-Bien Hoa
military complex and Saigon. But
critics within the Army say that their
absence from Phuoc Tuy contributed
to the ability of local units to penetrate
the “fence” and re-establish themselves
in the Long Hai hills near Baria. It
also undoubtedly facilitated their TET
attacks on major towns in the province.
It also contributed to the need for
costly Operation Pinaroo to re-clear the
Communists from the mine-ridden Long
Hai hills.
And immediately after that, Brigadier
Hughes and his headquarters staff
vacated Nui Dat again for Bien Hoa
province to command two of the Task
Force’s three battalions in the huge
Operation Toan Thang around Saigon.
General Weyand, American com-
mander of Field Force Two, head-
quartered in Bien Hoa likes to have
Australian troops around him and is
evidently getting his way these days.
It must be said that circumstances
also contributed to the change in the
deployment of Australian troops. The
main elements of the Viet Cong Fifth
Division were gone from Phuoc Tuy
by about November last year, and so
there was some good logic in following
them north. In addition, the emphasis
of Communist operations shifted from
attempts to gain control of the country-
side to a massing for assault on the big
cities—beginning in December.
And the addition of a third battalion,
and then tanks, enabled the Australian
Task Force to be split into at least two
parts, so that a minimum of work in
Phuoc Tuy could be done even when
the main strength was being applied
outside.
Western Australia
Housing pressure
PREMIER BRAND had to admit last
week that the Press had been right and
he and his Government wrong in their
differences of opinion about housing in
Western Australia. The admission was
tacit, in the form of a request to the
Commonwealth for another $5-6 million
to finance low-cost housing, in addition
to the $l3 million the State already
gets, with the probability of a request
for more later.
Only a week earlier, Housing
Minister Des O’Neil had claimed
that criticism of the Government over
housing was unjustified because it did
not consider the problem as a whole,
but only what the Government was
expected to do. There was no crisis,
he said, only a shortage.
The intriguing aspect of O’Neil’s
claim was the fact that he made it at
a civic reception to ACTU delegates in
Perth, sympathising with them for
sometimes having to contend with re-
porting that was unfair and biased.
Turning to the Labor Deputy Leader,
Mr. Herb Graham, he said: “I’m sure
Mr. Graham will agree with me.” Mr.,
Graham, who could teach a fox a
trick or two, did not agree with him,
but said later: “The newspapers have
disagreed with me and my actions
and I have disagreed with them, but
this is inevitable between any people.”
Likewise, ACTU president Albert
Monk expressed himself “intrigued” by
Mr. O’Neil’s remarks, but went only
part of the way with him. For the basis
of the dispute was, who reflects more
accurately public opinion in the State—
the papers or the Government? And,
as much as Labor may dislike the Press,
to have gone along with Mr. O’Neil’s
criticism would have been to concede
a vital point.
The waiting period for State Housing
Commission homes could soon be five
years, according to a survey by white-
collar unions. These people are perhaps
the hardest hit of Western Australian
workers, often trapped on a level that
brings in too much money to make
them eligible for low-rental and low-
interest State housing, but not enough
to enable them to get their own.
But even more than white-collar
workers, the migrant (the West ab-
sorbing most in all Australia) is being
affected, according to Mr. Edwin White,
O’Neil...“shortage, not crisis”
formerly a migration officer in Britain
and now secretary of the Good Neigh-
bor Council. About 18 months ago, he
was quoting $l6 to $lB a week foi
rentals, he says: now the figure is $24
to $4O a week. He cites the case of a
truck-driver, his wife in hospital having
their fifth child, driving the other four
with him all day, then looking after
them in a caravan . , . yet not con-
sidered eligible for State Housing
emergency accommodation.
Admittedly, State housing permits
-and approvals, which will be trans-
lated in three or four months into
bricks and mortar, have turned upward;
land is being rezoned to bring down
the crippling homesite prices; efforts
had been made to siphon Common-
wealth money into housing, but the
shortage of low-cost housing was get-
ting worse.
When the Liberal Government had to
admit last week that this was so, the
“unfair and biased” Press let it down
lightly. Said the “West Australian,”
“Premier Brand’s election setback
seems to have put a useful burr under
the tail of the Government ... his
special approach to Canberra for
housing money for low-cost units is
amply supported by all the yardsticks
of economic progress. The Federal Gov-
ernment would be irresponsible if it
did not act quickly.”

This is one section of Sydney’s skyline which owes much to the use of
coppermetals in unusual and interesting applications. The buildings
concerned are the State Government Block and Qantas' new Wentworth Hotel.
Over 900 tons of copper and copper alloys were involved in the State Office
Block, including 200 tons of pre-oxidised brass used in the cladding of its
exterior columns. About 250 tons of bronze sections were used in the window
frames and electrically-operated sliding doors. Another interesting feature
seen in the left foreground is a 56 ft. diameter copper-clad fountain. This
also doubles as a cooling medium for the massive air-conditioning system.
The Wentworth Hotel’s two storey copper awning is unique in the world. It
has a surface area of nearly 4,000 square feet of smooth copper, with vertical
ridges and recesses 8 inches wide for its full width of 130 feet. This is matched
with a copper parapet around the front top of the building and there is also a
copper fascia above the Bligh Street entrance to.the rear.
Both these fine buildings are splendid examples of the potential for copper-
metals wherever beauty and originality of design must combine with perma-
nence and practical utility.

New Zealand Labor
A near crisis
NEW ZEALAND’S Labor leadership
received an upset when the Party
conference voted to “oppose SEATO.”
Although the badly worded motion was
not a clear directive for the Party, the
spirit is quite clear. But it has already
led the vociferous critics of New
Zealand’s foreign policy to misinterpre-
tation. One parliamentary correspon-
dent, writing in the provincial
“Manawatu Standard,” depicted these
as isolationist forces, when, in fact, the
opponents of SEATO display a variety
of attitudes. The isolationist image is
based on the view that military in-
volvement in South-East Asia is the
primary type of involvement, but
SEATO’s opponents probably want
more involvement with Asia and the
Pacific than most of SEATO’s advo-
cates.
They persistently urge that economic,
diplomatic, and cultural links are the
most significant ones with the area, and
urge basically that New Zealand’s in-
volvement be directed to raising the
standard of living. Furthermore, their
distrust of SEATO, which existed
since the organisation was formed in
1954, is that American military involve-
ment in the area is illegitimate. The
significant point is that these feelings
have now become sufficiently wide-
spread to upset the Labor Party’s tacit
acceptance of the military alliance.
The Labor leadership displays token
hostility to U.S. military policies, but
presents this less energetically than the
Party rank and file. They hold to the
view that the American alliance is
something that ought not be over-
turned. This may be from conviction,
but more likely for electoral safety.
Part of the problem is a lack of clear
understanding about just what the
leadership’s plans for SEATO are.
Labor Leader Kirk put forward a
proposal designed to present an alterna-
tive to the dying organisation, suggest-
ing a Pacific Council, which supposedly
would not only link Australia and
New Zealand concerns in the Pacific
Islands but somehow bring Malaysia,
Singapore, and Thailand in later.
What might have been on his mind
was the apolitical South Pacific Com-
mission, which seems to resist keeping
pace with the new interest of the
Islands for a regional grouping, usable
as a forum for their views. So when
the Party conference voted to oppose
SEATO, Kirk and the Party leadership
generally became upset. The SEATO
resolution had passed through one of the
conference committees, which had voted
in favor of SEATO. Conference, heavily
weighted with young Laborites, took
the exceptional step of overturning the

committee recommendation. Rumors
spread that an attempt was to be made
by the Party leaders to counter this;
but, after having their fingers burned
earlier on another matter, they shied
away from the hot topic.
Behind the delegates’ mass support
for the anti-SEATO view lies the in-
creasing impact of the Vietnam protest
movement. Prior to the SEATO Powers’
meeting in Wellington in early April,
a protest conference on Peace, Power,
and Politics in Asia was held. Many
of its thousand delegates were also
Labor conference delegates. At the
PPP rally anti-SEATO fervor in-
creased as delegates probed SEATO
roots —the causes of instability in Asia.
A further backlash to this increasingly
sophisticated criticism of foreign policy
a sophistication that follows a transi-
tion from slogans to study, and rhetoric
to reason is the view on Malaysia.
Kirk has indicated an interest in
contributing Commonwealth Strategic
Reserve troops to Malaysia after the
British withdrawal takes effect. But
Labor conference was about to upset
that view, following a proposal from
parliamentary candidate and history
lecturer Dr. Michael Bassett that, on
British withdrawal, Labor not support
any endeavor to replace her and act as
“fireman.” Conference sentiment was
Kirk ... unity saved the day
supporting Bassett, and the view may
have become policy had Kirk not
intervened. The end result was a two-
thirds majority for Kirk. Unions de-
cided unity was sufficiently worthwhile
to support Kirk on this. Unity also
kept Vietnam from disrupting the
Party. The leadership stated their ad-
herence to the basic 1966 Joint Coun-
cil of Labor policy of withdrawal of
troops; with hopes for an actual settle-
ment in the wake of the Paris peace
talks.

OVERSEAS
The French revolution
THE PARADOX of the confrontation
with the French Communist Party
which faces General de Gaulle, brought
back from a State visit to Rumania
by the controlled chaos spreading across
the nation, is that the Communist
unions and the Government they appear
to be challenging are both on the same
side of the barricades. Their common
enemy is the astonishing student insur-
rection which, for a moment last week,
rocked not only the regime but the
social structures of the entire country.
Certainly it is the Communist Party
and its trade-union arm, the CGT
(Confederation Generale du Travail),
which ordered the paralysis that has
crept hour by hour across the nation.
It is an imposing demonstration of the
Communists’ organised strength. They
are the arbiters of the situation. If the
Government wants a settlement, it must
deal with them.
But it was the students who opened
the door to the unknown. They tore
down the intimidating edifice of French
education, and from the rubble
marched, banners flying, on society
itself.
The turning-point of this whirlwind
crisis came late last week. In near
desperation, the establishment not
only the Government but also the
bureaucrats of the great Communist
unions—rallied to its own defence. The
Prime Minister, M. Pompidou, called
on all Frenchmen to turn away from
anarchy. Police reservists were called
up. The Eiffel Tower was placed under
guard. The CGT alerted its members
against any outside interference in the
affairs of the working class —a clear
sign that the Communist unions had
disowned the students.
This is the real significance of the
vast Communist-ordered strike move-
ment. Like a gendarme astride the
French economy, the CP has held up
and stopped the traffic. “We are in
charge here,” the Party is saying. Only
by this dramatic mobilisation of its
troops can the orthodox Communist
Party outbid the students’ agitators and
isolate their revolutionary virus.
Only in this way can the apparatus
which heads the Communist unions
retain its control and protect its base
from contamination. Economic dis-
location and incredible inconvenience
are the price which French society is
having to pay to head-off an insurrec-
tional movement which no one saw
coming and few have yet understood.
It now looks as if the Government
and the CGT in tacit alliance
have contained the insurrection, at great
profit, incidentally, to the unions. But
the revolution triggered off by the
students goes on. In a fortnight it has
transformed the tone of French life
to an unimaginable degree. A great
gust of liberalising fresh air has blown
through French minds. Under the
irresistible pressure of events, the
Gaullist style of government —•
fatherly, sanctimonious, preachifying,
distant can hardly be the same
again. The Elysee no longer has the
monopoly of wisdom.
In a curious way, General de Gaulle
himself, after being dominant in French
affairs for a quarter of a century, has
suddenly seemed an irrelevance. His
name has hardly been mentioned in
the past two weeks and this is not
only because he has been out of the
country preaching his gospel of national
independence to the Rumanians. His
great age, his authoritarian habits, his
gloriously traditional vision of France
seem to have put him completely out
of reach of the student revolutionaries.
From the day-and-night orgy of talk
at the Sorbonne, a great explosion of
public debate has burst across the
country. People are speaking their
minds. Nothing is sacred. The ruthless
control of information, one of the
main features of the Gaullist regime,,
has been broken.
In a modern telecommunications
society, the radio station is one of the
real seats of authority, its seizure the
symbol of a successful revolution. Last
Thursday, the student insurgents who
had already spilt out of the university
and occupied the State-owned Odeon
Theatre declared they would march on
Broadcasting House.
For the Government, this was the
gravest moment of the crisis. It faced
two horrifying dangers. First, that the
student rabble army might attack and
seize further Government property, and
particularly the radio, secondly, that
the Communist unions, the most power-
ful popular force in the country, would
join forces with the student extrem-
ists. This could have meant real, and
probably bloody, revolution.
M. Pompidou held a council of war
and addressed the nation. He pledged,
in the most sober tones, that the Gov-
ernment would defend the Republic.
At that moment he gambled with his
whole political future. In the short
term at least, his gamble has paid off.
By the weekend it was clear that the
students did not want another bloody
clash with the police. The march
on the radio station was called off.
Secondly, and still more important, the
Communist unions disowned the
students’ insurrection, and called out
their own men in a rival show of
strength. The fateful wedding of
workers and students was not to be.
From that moment the Republic was
reasonably safe.
But once again a price had to be
paid. The students did not seize the
radio station, but a less dramatic take-
over was being prepared inside it. The
first break in the Government control
took place last Tuesday when the
journalists at the television station
insisted on the showing of a film of
police brutality during the student riots.
The same night French TV gave
unprecedented coverage to the scathing
attack on the Government by the
Socialist Opposition Leader, M.
Francois Mitterand, all the more effec-
tive because of its icy, controlled
violence.
But this unusual frankness did not
save the Government administrators.
On Friday a crowd at least 2000
strong, drawn from the whole range of
broadcasting services, demanded a
complete overhaul of French radio and
television: a new statute, real freedom
from Government control, and the
wholesale resignation of the existing
management. They decided to strike
if the Government did not give way.
The revolution taking place is


nowhere more obvious than in the
French education system. Since
Napoleon it has been rigid, centralised,
unitary, and stern. All this is no more.
At least 16 of France’s 18 universities
have crumbled to student power in an
atmosphere of incredible delirium.
The great Sorbonne courtyard has
been taken over by a bedraggled, wild-
eyed mob. Decorated with portraits of
Mao, Lenin and Marx, Trotsky, Castro,
and Guevara, festooned with Marxist,
anarchist, and Viet Cong flags, it is a
sort of bazaar for trafficking in revolu-
tionary ideas. A dozen extremist groups
clamor for attention.
Still more devastating, the contagion
has spread to secondary schools: the
baccalaureate, the revered summit of
French school education, has come
under frontal attack. This may be the
last year in which the shadow of this
examination darkens the life of every
well-bred French teenager. From top
to bottom of the system, exams —the
very symbol of French education—are
being boycotted. The cry is not so
much for reform as for total destruc-
tion and reconstruction. There has not
been such a shake-up for 150 years.
Having badly blundered in first try-
ing to crush the students with armed
force, the Government is now show-
ing a little skill. It is attempting to
take over the university revolution and
make it its own. It has made it quite
clear that it does not intend to prop
up and replaster the old university
structure, but to build something quite
fresh from the ruins.
The Government has approached the
most radical minds in university reform
to sit on a special commission to draft
plans for the future. This is a charac-
teristically Gaullist solution: after
breaking the Army and the old colonial
Right, the regime is now all set to
break the old university, too or
rather to acquiesce with the best grace
in a job which has already been done.
Another casualty of the past week
is the credibility of political parties
in the Centre and on the Social Demo-
cratic Left. The regime has lost the
students, but it is clear that the Socialist
opposition has not gained them. In the
minds of student revolutionaries, Gov-
ernment and opposition are lumped
together in one dreary, fossilised, dis-
credited bunch.
M. Mitterand has called on the
Government to resign, but it is ex-
tremely doubtful whether he would
choose this moment to test the strength
of his support at the polls. One of the
ironies of the present crisis is that, if
M. Pompidou weathers it, he will be
everywhere recognised as De Gaulle’s
successor, and no defections are likely
seriously to endanger his parliamentary
majority. With new, unknown, un-
predictable political forces about, none
oil the traditional parties wants a
general election.
The crucial New York primary ballot will give Kennedy his toughest fight
Kennedy campaigning
Home truths
AT A MOMENT when, after his
Nebraska and Indiana primary victories,
Senator Robert Kennedy is generally
riding high, he has suddenly been
brought face to face with a serious
threat of revolt in his own backyard,
the Empire State of New York, which
sends the largest delegation of any
(190 votes) to the Democratic National
Convention.
Until recently it had been widely
assumed that this powerful block of
votes would go automatically to Senator
Kennedy. Now no one is anything like
so sure.
The story starts six months ago, when
an up-State millionaire Democratic
Congressman Joseph Resnick in
announcing his intention to run for
Senator Javits’ Republican Senate seat,
first put the match to an issue which is
already badly singeing the whole
Kennedy New York campaign.
Five years ago he turned his attention
and his considerable energies to politics,
was rewarded with the Democratic nom-
ination in his own rock-ribbed Republi-
can congressional district, and, to every-
one’s surprise, won it (transforming a
Republican majority of 50,000 into a
Democratic plurality of 12,000). That,
of course, was the year of the Johnson-
Goldwater election and strange things
were happening all over the nation. But
two years later, when virtually all the
Democratic gains of 1964 were wiped
out in a Republican House sweep,
Resnick still held on to his seat. It
was the kind of achievement that nor-
mally would win at least the grudging
respect of political professionals like the
Kennedys.
Instead, however, in the Kennedy
camp it provoked consternation for
by then the congressman had made his
views of the junior Senator from New
York altogether clear. Originally
describing him merely as “a dangerous
demagogue,” he soon began developing
a massive no-holds-barred assault on
Kennedy’s alleged readiness to stop at
nothing in order to make himself Presi-
dent.
With no shortage of funds behind
him—and with, it is widely suspected,
the discreet encouragement of the White
House Resnick has lately taken to
inserting whole-page advertisements in
the “New York Times” which, far from
being directed at the Republican enemy,
are solely aimed at Senator Kennedy.
The most recent appeared under a
heavy-type headline, “Senator Robert
F. Kennedy does not want me elected
to the Senate of the U.S.”
According to Resnick, Bobby Ken-
nedy had never wanted to “share his
unique position as the highest elected
Democrat in the State,” was deter-
mined that all those elected to office
in New York should be “puppets who
will dance to his tune,” and had con-
sistently prevented “good and loyal
Democrats from rising to the top lest
they threaten his control of the Party
machinery and particularly his con-
trol of the delegates to the Democratic
National Convention.”
In any other State in the Union such
an indictment would probably sound
singularly unconvincing. In his bid to
win the nomination, Kennedy’s prob-
lem all along has, after all, been not
with the people but with the Party
organisation. In New York, however,
the boot has always been firmly on
the other foot.
The people who first invited Ken-
nedy into the State were the old-line
Party bosses—and, to the disappoint-
ment of his more idealistic admirers,
Kennedy has insisted on keeping his
links with them ever since. The in-
evitable ironic consequence is that the
very same flag that Kennedy himself


is raising elsewhere —a people’s revolt
against the power of the Party machine
—is now being run up against him by
his political enemies in New York
State.
If it were just a matter of Resnick
(a down,-the-line defender of LBJ
and the Vietnam War) it would not
perhaps matter. But in New York Ken-
nedy now finds himself being attacked
on two flanks simultaneously.
When the primary for convention
delegates takes place in New York a
month from now, the Kennedy-
approved candidates will face chal-
lenges not only from Humphrey-
backers marching under the banner
of Mr. Resnick but also from the
traditionally strong and wealthy New
York liberal community which
partly because of Kennedy’s identi-
fication with the old-line power brokers
of New York elections is putting
forward McCarthy-pledged delegates in
39 out of the State’s 41 congressional
districts.
One close Kennedy confidant
candidly admitted this week: “As of
now, we’re in real trouble here.
McCarthy’s got Manhattan and the rich
New York suburbs all those fat
liberal cats think he’s the reincarnation
of Adlai Stevenson and Humphrey’s
bound to take virtually the whole of
conservative up-State New York. We’re
left with just the old organisational
baronies and, frankly, having them
in our pocket doesn’t do us much
good with other people. The trouble
with Bobby is that he still believes in
the domino theory.
“He’s convinced that if California
and Oregon fall to him, then New York
must do so, too. But here it is a dif-
ferent ball game. Everywhere else he
is the one who can attack broken-
down political machines, but in New
York he has to defend one. I’ll tell
you, it’s going to be tough tougher
than he thinks.”
Remarkably little attention has been
paid to the New York primary
partly, no doubt, because there is no
open Presidential listing on the ballot.
But, given that what is being elected
here is the biggest delegation of all to
the convention, what happens in New
York could settle the outcome of this
year’s struggle for the Democratic
nomination far more decisively than the
more glamorous and photogenic con-
tests in Oregon and California.
Whatever he may achieve elsewhere,
if Kennedy is badly bruised in his own
home State, it will be virtually the end
of his White House aspirations.
That is a truth that now seems to
have dawned on the Humphrey camp.
Understandably apprehensive of the
cumulative psychological impact of a
string of Kennedy victories in the Pre-
sidential primaries, they have suddenly
started to give their attention to the
one contest where Kennedy if only
because he occupies the organisational
citadel—has inevitably to be on the
defensive.
He has been the absentee prince
operating through local viceroys, many
of them the exact equivalent in habits
and outlook of the old princes of British
India. They are scarcely the type of
allies that anyone would choose, least
of all for a political campaign Kennedy
himself has described across the length
and breadth of America as “a crusade
against the forces of the status quo.”
The effect of these moves on Ken-
nedy’s local supporters has been to pro-
duce a mood almost of panic. Most
of them are only too well aware that,
if there is a stain on the Kennedy
radical record, it lies here in New
York State, where the Senator has
always seemed more interested in estab-
lishing his own personal dominance over
the Party rather than placing it under
effective liberal control.
South Vietnam
Catholic dilemma
THE START of the Paris peace talks
has been little less than a moment of
truth for the leaders of South Vietnam’s
powerful Roman Catholic community.
The men on the Right, who have long
promised nothing but a fight to the
death against the Communists, now see
the possibility that they may one day
be left to fight by themselves.
A very small minority of young
priests and intellectuals on the Left
have till now argued that co-existence
with Communism may be a necessary
price to pay for peace. But what was
yesterday just a theory debated among
themselves with passion and despair
has now become a distinct possibility.
And they are not a little scared.
The reaction of the Church’s con-
servatives is easy to understand. In
the first place, many of them are
North Vietnamese who fled to the
South after the 1954 Geneva agree-
ments. Over half of the 1,700,000
Catholics in South Vietnam today have
come from the North, and what is more
important in a country where parish
priests have much in common with
ward bosses in old Boston, so have
nearly two-thirds of all the priests.
These men smell betrayal in the air.
Their miraculous rescue from the North
in 1954 no longer looks permanent. It
is as though Moses, having seen the
Red Sea gratifyingly block the way of
his enemies, were to learn a little
later that the waves were about to
roll back and let them through. The
analogy of Moses seems doubly apt, for
these priests are Old Testament men
and make no bones about it.
Many of them have been literally
fighting the Communists on and off for
years. Their most militant leaders
include priests from the fortress diocese
of Bui Chu, which after fighting for
years against the Vietminh moved south
in 1954 en masse, almost down to the
last priest and parishioner. Their con-
centration round Saigon, where about
half the northerners eventually settled,
has added to their political influence.
Any government that convinces these
priests of its anti-Communism can
count on busloads of faithful demon-
strators in time of trouble.
Their absolute hatred of Communism
drives them to suspect the Communists’
hand everywhere, from the Buddhist
movement to the BBC. They are even
ready to dismiss the progressives within
their own church as little better than
crypto-Communists.
Their recipe for Vietnam is simple,
and the less realistic it becomes the
more passionately they urge it. All the
Communists, including the National
Liberation Front, must withdraw to the
North. Only those who renounce their
Communism can be accepted in the
South. Anything else would be
“national treason.”
As for the Americans, they should
help more and interfere less. If
South Vietnam peace marchers in Tokyo last week ... but in Saigon thousands of
Catholic refugees from the Communist North are despairing of the future


America really wants peace it must
change its policy and aid the “real
anti-Communists” more effectively.
And there is defiant talk about tak-
ing to the maquis, the final hope of
continuing the fight. They claim that
“secret organisations” have already
been set up, particularly since the Tet
offensive. A visitor leaves them won-
dering whether these priests, who look
as tough as they talk, are already
wearing pistols under their cassocks.
The western world, and in particular
the Americans, has up till now found
this stubborness useful and encouraged
it. It will not be the fault of those*
priests and their obedient followers if
it one day proves embarrassing.
Their intransigence is all the more
understandable since many of their
doubts are at heart shared by their
most progressive colleagues. These men
are well informed about their church’s
confrontation with Communism in East
Europe and are hopeful of its lessons.
But they all seem to fear that the Viet-
namese Communists will prove dif-
ferent. Again and again you hear, “They
are Asians, remember, and far more
savage.” Although they grasp eagerly
at every word from the Pope on peace
in Vietnam, they wonder in their
hearts whether he, a European, can
really understand their predicament.
These men would be quite ready to
see radical changes in the Church in
South Vietnam. They distrust its
wealth, its ownership of rice lands. If
they are more anguished than the
tough anti-Communists it is because
they fear that the right course of action
must involve suffering.
At heart it is not a question of the
Church’s survival. Said one priest: “The
Church in its eminence sleeps with all
regimes. But in its transcendence it
eventually cuckolds them all.” The
question is, if the worst comes to the
worst, how many Catholics must suffer
in this process of holy infidelity?
Television
Old idols made new
TELEVISION is turning out to be a
double-edged weapon in the Com-
munist world. The agitprop men were
not slow to recognise the potentiality
of the box as a propaganda instrument,
which explains why television instal-
lations were given investment priority
over less luxurious consumer, needs. But
having released the genie from the
tube, their current problem is how to
control it. The latest count puts the
number of sets in eastern Europe (ex-
cluding Russia) at between 13 and 14
million, with about five times as many
persons suffering from telemania.
People who have paid between two
and 12 months’ average working wage
for their latest , proud possession are
not going to be gripped night after
night by interminable visits to collective
farms or guided tours through identical-
looking factories. Gradually, the
authorities have been forced to pro-
vide a less indigestible bill of fare.
The standard of entertainment pro-
grams varies considerably, with the
Yugoslavs, as usual, getting the best of
both worlds the besT current affairs
and commentary programs, and a good
slice of canned western entertainment.
Rumanian television viewers were
gripped by “The Saint”; for a while
Roger Moore became a national idol
and that familiar matcHstick figure with
the halo is still found chalked on
Bucharest walls. The Poles went over-
board for a recent series of “Dr. Kil-
dare” and Party meetings were care-
fully avoided on Wednesdays for fear
of playing to empty halls. Perry Mason
was seen speaking perfect Polish and
Leonard Bernstein’s Concerts for
Young People drew high ratings.
This invasion of the private home
"These scarecrows must go!"
“Dr. Kildare,” “Perry Mason,” and “The Saint”...fans in Communist Europe, too
does not pass uncriticised. Last month
Mr. Todor Zhivkov, _the Bulgarian
leader, sent a letter to cultural and
broadcasting directors in which he in-
sisted that there was general “indigna-
tion and alarm” over television artists
who “imitate the bearing and apparel
of rather dubious images of western
variety and TV shows.” Mr. Zhivkov
may not be alone in believing that
“long hair on males and short skirts
on females” are not in accord with
accepted ideas of beauty and therefore
“these scarecrows must go.”
But programs still contain a heavy
slice of documentaries, discussions of
Party decisions, and long diatribes.
Hungary, which ranks pretty low in
the entertainment field, has a solid
hour’s program at a peak viewing hour
every week on “Consciousness in the
Socialist Fatherland” and Party ideo-
logical chiefs have publicly insisted that
“the emphasis of television should. be on
work discipline, work mores, and social
responsibility.” Not a formula calcu-
lated to cause a run on television sets.
Despite this, the average Hungarian,
according to a recent survey, spends
most of his waking hours, when not
working, firmly entrenched with his
family before the box.
All East European networks are
linked to Intervision, a counterpart of
Eurovision, and Yugoslavia itself is tied
into the Eurovision network, which last
year provided some 250 transmissions,
mostly sporting and cultural, to its
eastern opposite numbers. Even the less
with-it television editors recognise that
they cannot go on selling their dusty
wares without some sort of packaging;
so spellbinding programs on efficient
factories and heroes of labor are
screened with a background of ultra-
modern western beat music.
In general, television programs still
lack a relative freedom for open dis-
cussion and criticism of national affairs
and unbiased reporting and commentary
on international developments. One
factor is a dire shortage of topical news
films. But Yugoslavia and Czechoslo-
vakia are beating a new path. The
Czechs, newly relieved of censorship,
now have a lively coverage of current
affairs, domestic and foreign, round-
table discussions between Party leaders,
workers, and intellectuals (which occa-
sionally get too heated for the comfort
of more conservative viewers), and
relentless inquisition of leaders by tele-
vision interviewers who dispense with
the familiar planted questions. ! .
Television is becoming big industry
in Communist Europe, despite residual
pockets of opposition. As tastes become
more catholic, so do demands for the
latest electronic equipment. Czecho-
slovakia, to cite one example, plans to
erect 59 high-output VHF transmitters
and several hundred booster stations in
the next few years, plus a switch to
color with the French system. Russian
equipment, like Russian television
material, is regarded as unsuitable and
what they cannot afford to buy from
‘the United States and western Europe
the Czechs and East Germans are
rapidly developing for themselves.
One distraction East European
viewers are spared is commercials; what
few there are between six and 12
minutes an evening average are of
unparalleled banality, usually about
machine tools or, when Poland ran
into an acute butter shortage, of the
“You can’t tell the difference between
marge and butter” variety. One
bastion still holding out against the
box is Albania and a current Yugoslav
story has it that the evening program,
such as it is, opens with “Good Even-
ing, Comrade Enver,” since Enver
Hoxha owns the one set in the country.

IF AMERICA LEAVES?
THE
DOMINOES
AND THEIR
POLITICAL
LEADERS
By DONALD HORNE
IT WAS a great time for making
phrases in the mid-19505, and in this
aspect of the cold war the Americans
were well ahead in production. The
principal manufacturer of hot words
for the cold war was Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles. He threat-
ened Russia by replacing the word
“containment” with the word libera-
tion”; he threatened Western Europe
with the words “agonising reappraisal”;
he threatened Ho Chi Minh with the
words “massive retaliation”; he threat-
ened Mao Tse Tung with the words
“unleashing Chiang Kai Shek”; and, in
the most famous phrase of all, he
threatened the lot of them by expound-
ing the philosophy of “brinkmanship.”
(“If you are scared to go to the brink,
you are lost.”) The Chinese came back
by threatening Dulles with the words
“paper tiger.”
As was appropriate in a cold war,
these words were not accompanied by
action. In Eastern Europe nobody was
liberated; in Western Europe _ nothing
was agonisingly reappraised; in Indo-
China nobody was massively retaliated
against; in East Asia Chiang Kai Shek
stayed on the leash, and, overall,
America stayed well away from the
brink (until John F. Kennedy later
successfully walked over to it during
the Cuba confrontation). The principal
action in the mid-1950s was the Geneva
settlement of the war in Indo-China
when, in what the French Prime
Minister spoke of as “a stock clearance
sale,” North Vietnam was remaindered
to the Communists.
It was at this time of word-spinning
that the “domino theory” of South-East
Asia was propounded. This particular
piece of phrase-making (the work of
President Eisenhower) is the only left-
over of the slogans of the mid-1950s
that still has meaning for us. The idea
was that South-East Asia was so fragile
that it was like a house made of
dominoes: if you pushed one of them
out, the rest fell down. For Australians,
who tend to use their dominoes only for
playing dominoes with, and not for
building houses or similes, it might
have been more illuminating if the
Americans had changed their figure of
speech and spoken of South-East Asia
as a house of cards. However, the issues
raised were of fundamental significance.
And they may now be put to the
test as the nations of South-East Asia
and Australia now ask themselves:
What happens if the Americans pull
out of South Vietnam in such a way
that at once, or later, there is a Com-
munist victory? If this happens, will
South-East Asia really prove to be a
pack of cards, and will it fall down?
Before considering such questions one
must get oneself into the right mood
of honest uncertainty. Questions of this
BURMA
kind can never get firm answers,
because they are about complex situa-
tions in the future which cannot be
predicted with certainty. In one’s
ordinary life one can make simple
assumptions about the future on a basis
that seems to appeal to reason: and one
can act on such assumptions with a
semblance of reason, without getting
unnerved by the fact that one is acting
on “mere assumption.” But when it
comes to a future situation so different
and complex as this, there is no possi-
bility of even the semblance of cer-
tainty: decision has to be based partly
on guesses. This is true not only of the
future. As things stand now in South
Vietnam, in May, 1968, all the parties
concerned have to act on guesses as well
as evidence: nobody knows all of what’s
going on.
When tipping the future is just an
intellectual guessing game, it can be
quite sensible to say: Look, this is a
lot of nonsense. There isn’t even enough
evidence for a shrewd guess. Let’s
change the subject and talk about some-
thing sensible. But when decisions have
to be made, such an attitude can be
quite stupid. One can apply reason as
much as one can and get whatever evi-
dence one can; then one can lay out
some guesses about future possibilities.
But this is the best one can do. There
is no “proof”; no final evidence. And
if a decision about action has to be
made, then it has to be made, some-
times on very little evidence. Ideally
the decided action should allow for all
present imaginable possibilities (“leaving
options open”), but this is sometimes
not possible. One does not escape from
this by not making a new decision,
since not to make a new decision is
also to make a decision and it can close
more options.
A lot of laughter has gone under the
bridges of a lot of mouths since the
domino theory was first put up. Most
of it has missed the point. The domino
theory was not asserted as a natural
THAILAND
CAMBODIA
MALAYSIA
SINGAPORE
INDONESIA
law, but as a basis for action. That
the evidence for supporting the domino
theory was not as strong as, for example,
the evidence supporting the second law
of thermodynamics was no criticism or
the domino theory as a basis for de-
cision. It seemed a sensible enough
assumption in the rpid-1950s that both
Russia and China wanted more States
to fall within the control of what then
seemed to be a monolithic Communist
bloc, and that the nations of South-
East Asia might be an easy knock-over,
so easy that if one or two of them went
the others would give in. The test was
this: why take the risk that this might
happen?
Anyway, what things were like m
1954 no longer matters. The domino
theory could have been false then u
LAOS
PHILIPPINES
true now. (Or false then and false now.
Or true then and false now. Or true
then and true now.) But the questions
remain: Are the Communist powers
expansionist? If so, where—and how—
are they likely to try to expand?
Ideally two other questions have to
be answered first. Unfortunately they
are unanswerable. These questions are:
What is going to happen in South
Vietnam? What will be American policy
in the rest of South-East Asia?
But while these. questions cannot be
given definite answers, that doesn’t stop
the discussion. If the war simply goes
on in Vietnam in some form or other,
or if, somehow or other, the North
Vietnamese lose, the domino theory
in so far as it assumes that South Viet-
nam is the missing domino does not
apply. But what one can speculate about
is some kind of a Communist victory
in South Vietnam. As things look for
the moment the range of possible
American policy in South Vietnam has
narrowed: on present indications, the
firmest future American policy is one
AUSTRALIA
°f de-Americanisation” of the war, in
which the Americans, although support-
ing the South Vietnamese Government,
would cease to lay themselves so
obviously on the line: the weakest
future American policy is one of quick
settlement at any cost or, as the
French put it in 1954, “a stock, clear-
ance sale.”
What should be remembered is that
it is extremely likely that when we
speak of “settlement” we speak of some
arrangement in which the North Viet-
namese gain something between certain
victory and a very high probability of
victory. They are unlikely to “settle”
or less. What would be significant for
e r^st South-East Asia \Yould be the
speed and degree of victory they would
0 tain. A quick, humiliating American
defeat might have results that would
not be the same as the results that
would come from a series of events that
would last two or three years or more,
beginning, say, with long-drawn-out
negotiations, then perhaps some kind
of a truce, then some kind of a coali-
tion government, then finally a
Communist Government which would
amalgamate South Vietnam with North
Vietnam.
The question of American policy in
the rest of South-East Asia would be
enmeshed with the speed and nature
of events in South Vietnam and with
general reactions 'back home in
America. At present it is ridiculous to
be more specific, except that one might
tip some degree of decrease of Ameri-
can interest (from slight and tentative
to total and filial).
If bargaining becomes serious, what
the Americans are likely to go for is
some kind of agreement about the
stability of South-East Asia as a whole:
for this the Americans might swop the
possibility of a phased Communist vic-
tory in South Vietnam. But they
mightn’t get this. And, of course, even
if they did, the agreement might not
be worth the treaty it was written into.
But all this could save face, and spin
things out for a bit longer, in the hope
that the wind might change.
Before looking at the other dominoes,
let us assume two things. One is some
kind of Communist success in a South
Vietnam settlement (whether it is quick
and obvious or slow and devious might
make a difference). The other assump-
tion is that the Americans no longer
consider South-East Asia as an area in
which they must obviously and neces-
sarily take action. (Whether they then
become selective in their actions or
altogether lose interest would obviously
make a lot of difference.)
Now back to the earlier questions:
Are the Communist powers expansion-
ist? If so, where and how are they
likely to expand?
Compared with the still apparently
monolithic Communist power of the
mid-19505, “world Communism” does
not now mean one big thing: it is now
better thought of as an arena in which
various Communist Parties struggle for
power, influence, and prestige. From
the point of view of South-East Asia
the three Communist nations we need
worry about are North Vietnam, China,
and Russia.
NORTH VIETNAM is obviously
expansionist. It wants to expand at
least as far as South Vietnam and there
is enough evidence to make the assump-
tion that at present it also has
the tendency to expand into Laos and
Cambodia, and perhaps into North-East
Thailand as well. Communist messi-
anism and power-hunger here combine
with historical attitudes: even without
Communism, the Vietnamese would be
likely to have their eyes on Laos and
Cambodia. With Communism, and with
victory in South Vietnam, they might
become so arrogant that they might
seek some kind of hegemony over most
of mainland South-East Asia. This
would be likely to create tension with
China.
CHINA, it is true, is more of a
puzzle and the answers to the puzzle
are of fundamental importance. At least
as long as America still professes
interest in South-East Asia it seems
highly unlikely that China would
engage in direct aggression. However,
.God only knows what would happen
if America professed a complete lack
of interest in South-East Asia. In either
case it is obviously true that China
is at present prepared to support
indirect aggression. The evidence for
this is that it is doing so now. It pro-
vides militant propaganda on behalf of
the Communist Party of Burma, the
Thailand Patriotic Front, the National
Liberation Army of Malaya, the Huks
in the Philippines, and the pro-Chinese
elements in the Indonesian PKI. It
provides comfortable exile for insurgent
leaders; it trains cadres of guerillas;
and, to put it mildly, it would not
seem unnatural to the Chinese if they
were to exercise hegemony in South-
East Asia. To say all this is not to put
up a natural law that China will auto-
matically expand into South-East Asia.
It can be argued that a lot of the
present activity is designed mainly to
support China’s image within the world
Communist movements as a militant
supporter of “People’s Wars”; it can
be argued that China is in such a mess
that it has become more inward-
looking; it can be argued that an
American withdrawal from Vietnam
might settle China down. To this, so
• far as decision-making goes, one can
only reply: Perhaps so," perhaps not.
But, with so many indications also
pointing the other way, it would be
ridiculous to take the risk of acting as
if China were a peace-loving nation
respecting the sovereignty of one and
all in South-East Asia. This is certainly
not the assumption made bv all or even
one of the political leaders of South-
East Asia. Even the “neutralists” see
China as a nation seeking further power.
RUSSIA is undoubtedly still attempt-
ing to widen its power, influence, and
prestige, but outside the Communist
nations, it is now acting as much like
an old-fashioned great power as a
specifically Communist power, seeking
naval bases, spheres of influence, and
so forth, as if we were all back in 1910.
In South Asia, India and Pakistan are


its two greatest interests, although it
still maintains some furtive and some-
what mysterious interest in Indonesia.
Apart from anything else, its struggle
to maintain predominance among the
world Communist movements still
leads it to consider support for local
insurgency, although its great power
interests can also lead it the other way.
(Some of the Middle East Governments
which Russia supports have banned
their Communist Parties.) All of the
non-Communist nations in South-East
Asia are now interested in relations with
Russia and the Eastern European Com-
munist nations because they believe
this can help them offset the Chinese.
Having taken a quick look at the
three relevant Communist powers,
and put crosses against North Vietnam
and China, we can now ask: If these
two nations were going to expand their
influence, where and how would they
he likely to do so? Since this is as
much a question of opportunity as of
motive, the best way to answer it is to
make a quick tour of the whole area
to see what the chances are.
LAOS would almost certainly be
ready to fall into Hanoi’s lap if there
were a Communist victory in South
Vietnam and even a small measure of
American disengagement in the rest
of South-East Asia. Beyond diplomacy,
there would not seem to be anything
the Americans would do about it—
or could do about it. A significant
part of the country is already con-
trolled by Communists who receive
most of their support from Hanoi; it
would not be difficult for them to take
over. Whether the result would be an
independent but satellite State or a
State included in some kind of federa-
tion is unpredictable. One of the hopes
for continuing even the present situa-
tion of a divided country would be if
there were some kind of agreement
among the major powers (including
Russia) that in Laos things should
more or less stay as they are. This
could possibly have an inhibiting effect
on Hanoi if it were particularly con-
cerned to maintain Russian support as
a counterbalance to China. In other
words, with a Communist victory in
Vietnam, the fate of Laos could de-
pend more on Russia than on America.
If Laos were part of the game between
Russia and China, its future would de-
pend very much on the relations of
both of these powers with Hanoi. But
even so the particular technique of
externally directed insurgency would
give Hanoi a good chance to say one
thing and do the other.
CAMBODIA, on the face of it, may
have a better chance than Laos. Its
leader, Prince Sihanouk, has based his
policies on three assumptions. One was
that both Thailand and Vietnam are
the historic enemies of Cambodia and
that the historic nightmare of Cam-
bodians is a partition of their country
by these two neighboring nations. The
second assumption was that the Ameri-
cans would not last the distance in
Vietnam. The third assumption was
that the Chinese would finally achieve
political dominance in South-East Asia.
Cambodia’s hopes rest with China. The
main hope for Cambodia against a
Hanoi that had won in South Vietnam
would be that China would not wish it
to grow too powerful and might try to
check what would probably be its
desire to take over Cambodia. Against
the other side of their nightmare a
Thailand that became friendly with
China the Cambodians have little
hope. The friendship of such a Thai-
land would obviously be more import-
ant to China than the independence
of Cambodia. In the case of both Laos
and Cambodia the hope is that a Com-
munist power (in the first case, Russia,
in the second, China) would preserve
them from another Communist power
(a Communist Vietnam).
THE WESTERN FLANK. Insurg-
ency can be most easily developed where
it already exists. Where insurgency now
exists is on the whole western flank of
South-East Asia. Guerilla warfare has
already been going on for years in most
of the region that runs along the
Chinese border from Laos and North-
East Thailand across Burma and Assam
to the Himalayan frontier of Tibet. So
far as India and Burma are concerned
it has lately become more serious, in-
creasingly taking the form of revolt
against the central governments of
these two countries.
In North-East India, Naga indepen-
dence movements defeated a 12-year
counter-insurgency campaign by the
Indian Army. In some places a fifth
of the Naga population was destroyed
by the Indians. The Ahoms are now
demanding the restoration of the in-
dependence they enjoyed before the
British conquered them in the 1890 s
and are training in Naga insurgency
schools; the Mizos are receiving arms
and training from Pakistan. In none of
these areas are there significant Com-
munist Parties, but there is now some
underground liaison with Chinese
advisers, and some training of task
forces in China itself.
In Burma there could be a return to
the civil war that almost destroyed
Burma after its independence. Taken
together, the Shans, the Karens, and
the Chins actually outnumber the
dominant Burmans. The Shans have
sought some Chinese assistance, in the
form of training and bases; and the
Chins have been assisted by China for
about 20 years. Recently the Karens
cleared out their Communists and
there are now moves for a unification
of the non-Communists in the guerilla
forces of all three races; there is even
talk of co-operation with the non-
Communist rebels in North-East India.
These movements in both India and
Burma are not produced by Chinese
conspiracy. What prompts them is a
deep and resistant communal national-
ism that revolts in an indigenous way
against the understandable attempts of
dominant races to turn into nations
the conglomerates of other races that
were arbitrarily united as colonies. The
leaders of these communalist move-
ments would like to break up the pre-
sent national barriers and make loose
federations out of their own regions.
But, although the Chinese do not cause
such tensions, it is out of such tensions
that they fashion their policy on So'uth-
East-Asia’s western flank. The Chinese
have a Minority Peoples Revolt Centre
in Kunming, which studies not only
local rebellions but the possibility of
these rebellions being joined by
Chinese subjects who are of the same
race as the rebels. There have already
been hints that out of their own racial
minorities in the Chinese Army the
Chinese could send in trained military
forces to assist the communalist rebels
of Burma and North-East India. It
is possible that if there were some
American disengagement from South-
East Asia Chinese boldness in the
rebel areas of the west flank might
increase with the degree of disengage-
ment. What should also be noted is
that it may be in these areas that the
Chinese are most interested, rather than
in those parts of South-East Asia that
to the Chinese are more remote. The
tensions on the west flank are not really
allowed for in the domino theory—but
they are none the less dangerous for
that.
THAILAND. When people speak of
the domino theory seriously, they speak
of Thailand. In its crudest form the
domino theory saw Vietnam falling
over, knocking down Laos and Cam-
bodia and then Thailand: when Thai-
land fell over it would then knock down


Malaysia and Singapore. This collapse
would then knock down what was left—
Burma and Indonesia, and perhaps even
the Philippines. There are three
criticisms to make of this statement of
the domino theory. One is that the idea
of downward progression ignores the
fact that it is on the western flank
that the easiest chances lie for the
Chinese, in the regions that lie along
their own border. The second is that
1954 is not 1968: the very success of
that interest in playing for time that
was prompted by the domino theory
may have made the relevance of the
domino theory less likely. The third,
and most important, criticism is that
Thailand would be less likely to fall
down than to bend.
The idea that, if deserted by the
Americans, Thailand would, like the
bamboo, bend with the prevailing wind
has for some time replaced the domino
theory in a great deal of speculation
about the future of South-East Asia.
It is based on the assumption that the
central tradition in Thai statecraft has
been the survival of Thailand as an
independent unit, a policy that suc-
ceeded in the face of the threats of
both European colonialism and Jap-
anese militarism. According to this
assumption, if the North Vietnamese
win and if the Americans either disen-
gage from Thailand or look quarter-
hearted about it, then the Thais would
go “neutralist,” as Cambodia is now,
and try to accommodate themselves to
China. If this happened, it would not
necessarily be a disaster to' anyone else.
Thailand might then become a kind of
buffer although it might also provide
a base for the National Liberation
Army of Malaya (supported by Indo-
nesia in the days of confrontation and
now inherited by China).
This theory is based on the assump-
tion of an American withdrawal of
interest in Thailand. For various
reasons, such a withdrawal seems less
likely than not. It is true that, after
Vietnam, the Americans would not be
likely to put themselves openly on the
line again so that they virtually take
over, but there is much support that
they can give without taking over. (The
Thais are not likely to want the Ameri-
cans to take over, anyway.) Given some
kind of continued American interest, it
seems possible that the Thais can
handle the insurgency problems that
exist in North-East Thailand. This area,
a third of Thailand, as big as Cambodia
and twice as populous, is poor, isolated
and physically miserable, and it has a
tradition of insurgency. Most of the
‘‘forest fighters” are not Communist,
but they are influenced by Communists,
and since 1965 they have been sup-
ported by China and, even more sig-
nificantly, by North Vietnam.
To people who assume that all Asians
are the same, it is easy to forecast that
Thailand will crumble, as Laos and
South Vietnam crumbled. But there are
a number of significant differences
between Thailand and South Vietnam.
In South Vietnam, the Viet Minh had
for 20 years provided a more or less
effective local government in the rural
areas; there is no such apparatus oper-
ating in North-East Thailand. In South
Vietnam, Communist strength came
from national leadership in a colonial
war; in Thailand there is a continuing
tradition of independent nationhood
the insurgency leaders are insignificant,
local men. Even more important, most
of them are not trying to take over
the Thai nation: they are trying to get
a better deal for their local areas, a
matter in which they can be as sceptical
of the Communists as they are of the
Government in Bangkok. In South Viet-
nam there was a breakdown of central
order; this is not likely to happen in
Thailand. In South Vietnam, “feudal
landlords” were and still are a
problem; this is not the case in Thai-
land.
The very terrain is different. Except
for the mountainous territory, where
there is the additional problem of
tribal minorities, North-East Thailand
is not the kind of country in which
“main forces” can be assembled or
hidden. Its openness would make it
impossible for the kind of strategy
followed in South Vietnam to be
followed in North-East Thailand. The
mountains are a problem—but Thai-
land is not the only country in the
world with a problem in its hill country.
It is fortunate that its mountains
occupy such a small part of its total
area.
While insurgency has been increasing
in North-East Thailand, it is still on an
extremely small scale. Without a local
government apparatus of their own,
without the mystique of national
leadership, and without the other
advantages of the Viet Cong, even the
Communists among the insurgents have
hesitated to use violence. There is no
sabotage and except in a few places
no local terrorism. (Since it would
come from weakness, violence could
destroy whatever support the insurgents
have.) Given all of these factors, it
would seem likely that the Thai Gov-
ernment can itself easily take all of the
military and police actions needed
against the malcontents of the North-
East. Of course we all know by now
that military and police action will not
solve the problems, but in those prob-
lems of poverty and isolation that pro-
vide the real reasons for discontent
there is no overriding intensive political
or social reason why the Thais, perhaps
with foreign economic assistance, can-
not move toward satisfying local
grievances. If the problems of the
North-East were wrapped up with a
rapacious landlordism that was itself an
essential part of the Thai Government,
action would be more difficult, because
it would involve some form of social
revolution against special entrenched
interest. But this is not so. The prob-
lems have been those of indifference
and neglect combined with a poverty
of terrain that would tax even a more
prosperous nation than Thailand. (This
is not to say that the Thai Govern-
ment will solve these problems, but
that it has a good chance of doing so.)
MALAYSIA AND SINGAPORE.
For Australians it may seem odd that
it has taken up to this stage in the story
to reach the area in which they are
specifically interested. But for Aus-
tralians there is some reason for
optimism in this very fact. Malaysia
and Singapore jut out from South-
East Asia like an afterthought, at the
end of a long peninsula that pokes into
that archipelago of islands that make
up Indonesia, the Philippines, and. New
Guinea, an area that has a different
history and a different racial, religious,
and cultural composition from the rest
of South-East Asia. Malaysia and Singa-
pore are not “hot” areas, like South-
East Asia’s western and eastern flanks,
and out of all the nations of South-East
Asia they are the two that show the
best signs of increase in economic
prosperity, better in fact than most of
the rest of the “developing nations” -
throughout the world. While there is
the core of a Malaysian insurgency
movement in being, with support from
China, it is not active; and while there
are political militants in Singapore, also
supported from China, most of them
are in jail. Under present circum-
stances, the two governments could
themselves handle the kind of rebellions
that could arise. To say this is not to
say that the future is necessarily rosy,
but that it is not necessarily filled with
danger. It should also be pointed out,
however, that the almost even division
of Western Malaysia’s population
between indigenous Malays and immi-
grant Chinese, the predominance of the
Chinese in Singapore, and the tensions
between Malaysia and Singapore are all
obvious danger points in which the
most obvious flashpoint is the economic
future of Singapore, still so dependent
on procurements for the Vietnam War,
and on spending from the British
base and open to Communist exploita-
tion of economic difficulties and,
through these, to exploitation of
Chinese-Malay communal clashes. But
to say this is not necessarily to be pessi-
mistic; there is considerable self-reliance
in Singapore, which could of itself, or
with foreign economic assistance, avoid
economic crisis. What may be most
relevant to Malaysia and Singapore,
however, may be what happens in Thai-
land.
INDONESIA. One cause for optimism
(however qualified) has, of course, been
the overthrow of Sukarno’s adventurism

by the present almost miraculous prag-
matism of the Suharto Government. In
the opening period of Sukarno’s long
end game, in his “Crush Malaysia” cam-
paign, he provided what seemed the
greatest threat to stability in the direct
relations between nations in South-East
Asia and, over the most hectic period,
his Foreign Minister turned Indonesia
into the only direct propaganda vehicle
for China in South-East Asia. Now
there is no power more suspicious of
China than Indonesia. It is true, of
course, that the Suharto Government
could be overthrown —but that doesn’t
mean that it necessarily will be, or that
it is likely to be.
The extraordinary success the In-
donesian Communist Party seemed to
enjoy under the last years of Sukarno
may have given a false idea of the
natural potential of Communist strength
in Indonesia. For one thing, the Party
had so broadened its base that many of
its recruits were mere fodder for the
Communists rather than trained and
zealous cadres. Even more important,
it flourished under the protection of
the President: as the tragic events of
the Indonesian massacres showed, when
that protection was destroyed, Com-
munists were slaughtered.
It is easy to exaggerate the direct in-
terest China has in Indonesia. Its
main interest at present seems to be
in the fate of its nationals there. It
is true that China will pick up any-
thing that is going, as it picked up the
friendship of Sukarno’s Government,
and as it picked up influence in the
Indonesian Communist Party. But, for
China, Indonesia is a fair way from
home. It might only be if there were
some kind of Chinese hegemony in
mainland South-East Asia that China
would again show a direct interest in
Indonesia. Even so, in Indonesia the
going is tough. The great size of its
population, its diversity, the antipathy
to both the Chinese and to Com-
munists shown by many of its peoples,
give Indonesia an impressive intrac-
tability.
THE PHILIPPINES. The probability
of America withdrawing interest in the
Philippines is at present very close to
nil, and since the Philippines, like In-
donesia, is an island republic it is
different from those regions on the
western flank of South-East Asia that
are contiguous to China and, unlike
Laos, Cambodia, and North-East Thai-
land, it is not within the reach of North
Vietnam. This is not to say that it
could not have troubles: but if it did
its troubles would be of its own making.
Racketeering, gangsterism, and brigan-
dage, the exploitation of peasants, and
the inflexibilities of its political system
appear to make the Philippine social
structure friable, and open to exploita-
tion by what is left of the insurgent
Huks whose earlier rebellion was
crushed by President Magsaysay. Its
enormous social injustices and the in-
adequacies of its political and adminis-
trative machines make mockery of
many of the gestures of democracy. But
offsetting this is the fact that the Philip-
pines manages to retain many of the
essential features of a political democ-
racy so that some of the frenetic sense
of permanent crisis comes from its
democratic nature.
THE PROSPECTS. What this quick
survey suggests is that, in such a com-
plex of diffuse situations, it would 'be
ridiculous to imagine that even a rela-
tively bad settlement in South Vietnam
would necessarily knock South-East
Asia to bits, with only China then to
put the pieces together again. Even
with some degree of American dis-
engagement there would not necessarily
be a “power vacuum,” but perhaps that
more normal and encouraging political
phenomenon —a conflict of powers. As
well as the tensions between the nations
of South-East Asia, there is a possibility
of tension between North Vietnam and
China; there is the known tension be-
tween Russia and China; there could
be a return of some European interest
in South-East Asia (the French are al-
most certain to hop back in); and there
is growing Japanese interest, particularly
in Indonesia and the Philippines. Such
a complexity of power interests, be-
cause of its very contradictions, is as
likely to lead to compromise and
stability as to their opposites. In his
much-misquoted pensee, even Mao Tse
Tung does not believe that power grows
only out of the mouth of a gun; enough
other kinds of power could operate in
South-East Asia for something less than
disaster to occur.
In 1954, during the cold war, for a
country even to declare itself “neutral”
could seem a disaster. This is at least
one thing we need not worry about
now. The allegiances of countries are
no longer stacked up like gamblers’
chips on one side of the table or the
other in what seemed a simple split
of the world into two packs. From
Australia’s point of view the central
question is: what happens to Thailand?
Even American disengagement from
Thailand would not necessarily be disas-
trous, if it led to a genuine Thai
neutrality. But—are the Americans
likely to disengage from Thailand? To
do so could unsettle faith in every
other American alliance. For the Ameri-
cans to continue to help Thailand (and
this is probably what they will do)
would not mean that they would be
ready to do anything at all for Thai-
land. The days when the Americans
imagined they were strong enough to
do whatever they might want to do
may now be finished. But it still means
they can do a lot for Thailand, and
since the problems that challenge the
Thai Government are problems in
which it must take the initiative itself,
this should be enough. Except perhaps
in cases of obvious direct aggression,
in future the Americans are not likely
to put themselves openly on the line,
as they did in South Vietnam; but if
national governments are ready to put
themselves on the line the Americans
may help them. This also implies that
if governments fail in handling their
own political problems, then the Ameri-
cans might simply let them fail.
To suggest all of this is not to say
that China doesn’t matter. Of course
it does. China’s external posture of
belligerence is a matter of infinite
anxiety. It is the present principal
problem in relations between the
Powers, and a threat to Russia and
India even more than it is a threat to
America. But the problem of China
exists whatever happens to South-East
Asia. It is a global problem, and, there-
fore, a problem Australia in itself can
do nothing about. All Australia can do
about China is to take out insurance
policies—of alliance and of ultimate
self-defence (becoming expensive to
take).
What Australia can do something
about is specifically to use its compara-
tively great economic resources to assist
Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, by
military means, and in other ways. It
has been said a dozen times in The
Bulletin, but it’s worth repeating: the
Gross National Product of Australia is
in itself greater than the GNPs of In-
donesia, Singapore, Malaysia (and the
Philippines) combined. Under these
circumstances to plead smallness is to
risk appearing a hypocrite—especially
to the Americans, who have spilled their
blood and their wealth more lavishly
than we have in a part of the world
that is not as important to them as it
is to us.
With luck in Thailand, whatever
disasters occur in South-East Asia
could pass our own neighbors by. To
declare Australian policy toward these
countries even before we know what
the Americans are likely to do in Thai-
land would be a kind of fool’s dip-
lomacy, not least because such a be-
trayal of responsibility could itself affect
American attitudes to Australia as
well as to Thailand.

Batman’s Adelaide
DEAR READER, it is four years since
your correspondent was in Adelaide
and one can only report that the place
has sunk quietly into sin without even
a sense of guilt.
The first establishment one noted was
labelled “Whisky-Go-Go.” What on
earth went on in there? Was it a disco-
theque? Was it a new type of bar? Did,
as a result of a signal, Adelaidians furi-
ously start drinking whisky?
Since one last was here, Sunday
sport has come, the TAB has come,
and even a State lottery has come.
Though you will be pleased to hear
that they have been modest about
this; the betting shops and the lottery
shops are not obvious. When the Lot-
tery Bill went to the Upper House
it came back with an amendment that
there was to be no street advertising.
The gentlemen of the Legislative
Council wanted none of the vulgarity
that goes on in Brisbane with the
Golden Casket.
Then, when they amended the
Licensing Act to bring in 10 o’clock
closing for the first time since 1915,
they made the hours 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.
So now there is a certain pride that
the State has the longest drinking
hours in Australia. When Victoria
made the change, Sir Henry fixed the
hours at 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. There
was a small cry from the alcoholics.
They pointed out the hell of waiting
the last hour from 9 a.m. for the doors
to open. So you see the South Austra-
lian legislature has been more sym-
pathetic to their alcoholics.
Then one noticed last week that the
S.A. President of the Australian Hotels
Association, Mr. Max Flanagan, advo-
cated lowering the legal drinking age
from 21 to 18 as it was in N.S.W.,
Victoria, and the A.C.T. This would be
more realistic “in keeping with cur-
rent trends and social climate.” Glory
be, this was backed by the “Adver-
tiser” and the “News,” both of which
wrote stirring leaders.
The 21 drinking age has stood mag-
nificently firm for 53 years. In 1863
in Adelaide, back in the days when it
was the custom to send junior down to
the local rubbity with a jug, the legal
age was 12. In 1880, Parliament raised
it to 15, in 1908 it went up to 16, and
in 1915, under the menacing threat of
the Kaiser and the need for keeping
our boys sober, up it went to 21.
All this is by the by. The thing that
has really shocked your correspondent
is the advent of barmaids. Now South
Australia was the one barmaidless
State, the one area where one could
oscape being lured to the demon by the
deadly female. When Mr. Dunstan
introduced his Licensing Bill in March
1967 he made it clear, regardless of
the recommendations of the Liquor
Royal Commission, that the ban on
barmaids would continue. Ah, but on
June 12 there was an uprising in
favor of barmaids at the State ALP
Convention. By a very slim majority,
75 votes to 71, they voted for barmaids,
provided they received equal pay, then,
10, Mr. Dunstan amended the Act and,
on October 2, Adelaide won barmaids
and a remarkable tale came to end.
It began in the mid-1880s when the
Temperance Societies launched an all-
out attack. Indeed, in 1889, the
“Christian Colonist,” the church
weekly, had a real scoop when it dis-
covered that barmaids were employed
at Parliament House. “The refreshment
and dining-rooms are the most spacious
and sumptuous description and there
are bars where pretty girls, prettily
dressed, dispense the most tempting
liquors in the most tempting way.”
“Colonist” made it clear those bar-
maids were tempting Members to the
neglect of their duty.
What’s more, the Alliance “Record”
produced this marvellous piece of
verse:
Wanted, a beautiful barmaid,
To serve at a city bar;
A plain looking girl would mar trade,
And would prove too slow by far.
Her eyes must be blue as a violet,
Or as black as a jetty sloe;
But they must not be over modest,
But sparkle, and burn, and glow.
Wanted, a beautiful barmaid,
To shine in a drinking den;
To entrap the youth of the nation,
And ruin the city men;
To brighten destruction’s pathway
False gleams with dark fate to blend;
To stand near Despair’s dark
gateway,
To hide Sin’s sad bitter end.
Actually, Adelaide’s strongest anti-
barmaid man was King O’Malley. In
1896 he was the new Member for En-
counter Bay. The chief planks of his
platform were that children born out of
wedlock should be legitimised, railway
carriages should have lavatories, and
barmaids should be banned. He was rea-
sonably successful on all three counts.
In his anti-barmaid speech he said
all Government Bills for the regulating
“Nobody can say we’re undemocratic —
we allowed a Labor Government to
bring in liberal drinking hours!”
An Adelaide barmaid ... her customers
are happy, but is the “loving moon-
eyed goddess"?
and limiting of the drunk traffic were
so much waste paper as long as the
barmaid system continued. They might
as well try to tame and manage a
huge rattlesnake, an Indian cobra, or
an Australian tiger snake, without
extracting the fangs, and the poison
pouches, as attempt to regulate and
limit the drunk traffic while the bar-
maid system remained in force, bespat-
tering with mud the golden mantle of
the loving, moon-eyed goddess of de-
mocracy South Australia.
King O’Malley’s Bill did not sur-
vive in the Legislative Council, but
his influence remained. The definite
move came in the Licensing Bill in
1908. It was a Bill designed not to
put any women out of work. A regis-
ter of barmaids was to be established
in each district, and only those who
had been barmaids for three months
could apply. The idea was that as the
present barmaids grow older and pre-
sumably no longer able “to brighten
destruction’s pathway” they would
slowly disappear.
Actually, they were around for a very
long time. Adelaide barmaids under
the soothing Rundle Street climate
clearly discovered the secret of eternal
life. It was either that or, as some
cruel people suggested, barmaids were
selling their registrations like seats on
the Stock Exchange.
When the barmaids, after the 60
year female drought, came to Adelaide
on October 2, 1967, the “Advertiser”
interviewed several of the ladies, one
of whom said all was well, there had
been “no rough language” or “bitten-
off words.”
However, your correspondent last
week went to an establishment at the
Arkaba Hotel called the Beachcomber
Bar. His shock could not have been
more profound. The barmaids, Sir,
were practically naked. Their tummies
were bare, their legs, arms, and feet
were bare and they wore grass skirts
and flowered bras. It was exactly what
King O’Malley was talking about, and
frankly it was a bespattering with mud
the golden mantle of the loving moon-
eyed goddess of democracy South
Australia.


DANCE: Moving with the times
Dance styles are mixed in “There Is a Mountain," major work in the first program by Ruth Galene’s Sydney-based New Dance
Theatre
Dancer-choreographer Ruth Galene...
"Classical ballet does not say anything
about the times in which we’re living ”
BALLET? By all means. But does the
classicism of “Swan Lake” have any-
thing left to say? The Australian Ballet
Company? Bravo! But in satisfying part
of the national cultural conscience with
its success tet home and abroad, is it
really expressing itself in the vigorous
idiom of Australia today?
Modernists are raising the questions;
progressives are slowly beginning to step
out some answers. Influenced largely
by the dynamically mod choreography
of such eclectic Americans as Alvin
Ailey, Robert Joffrey, and Alwin Niko-
lais (who used concrete music, 12 slide
projectors, and 30 madly flashing spot-
lights for a recent ballet in New York),
a modern dance movement is thrusting
its way into recognition in Australia.
These are early days and nothing too
far out is yet being attempted, but the
boundaries of classical ballet are being
vaulted.
Ronne Arnold, an American Negro
now resident in Australia, has been tour-
ing a jazz-oriented modem dance com-
pany around New South Wales country
towns for the Arts Council no less, and
Ruth Galene recently introduced her
New Dance Theatre to a public in
Sydney. Says German-born Miss Galene:
“It is time to complement the Austra-
lian Ballet Company with a second,
more adventurous Australian company.”
More adventurous than Helpmann or
Van Praagh? Well, yes. After all,
although their company’s 1968 season
will include a new ballet by Helpmann
himself, one by the young Garth Welch,
and something up to date from the U.S.,
such oldtimers as “Swan Lake” and
“Giselle” are back in the program.
The Australian Ballet Company has
its feet in the classical traditions and
doesn’t really step much farther beyond
them than George Balanchine did 20 or
30 years ago. Yet even the company’s
male star Garth Welch has returned
from 15 months’ exposure to the new
movement in New York saying that
he’s bored with Balanchine.
It is the very success of the Aus-
tralian Ballet which has made it pos-
sible for the modernists to leap away at
45 degrees; it was no use trying to do
the skooby-doo until the arabesque had
been capably conquered.
“Classical ballet says nothing about


the times in which we’re living,” says
Ruth Galene, who herself has danced
for such lively classicists as Borovan-
sky and Roland Petit.
It’s probable that Miss Galene’s
-choreographed reflections of now and
the future have less to say to a lot of
people than “Coppelia.” Art necessarily
never waits for the majority to catch
up. “What I’m after is the young
public, a public attuned to modernism,”
she says. “This modern movement
which is exciting America didn’t happen
overnight, but we have a greater chance
of moving faster.”
After returning early this year from
a study tour of the United States,
Canada, England, Holland, Germany,
and Israel, Miss Galene planned her
new company and plotted her choreog-
raphy. Dancers were no problem:
dozens of them cut loose from the
banalities and formalities of the danc-
ing lines in Sydney nightclubs, theatre-
restaurants, television studios, and
theatres to give their spare time to
her as unpaid professionals.
After two Sunday-night performances
in Sydney’s Cell Block Theatre
of her first program Ruth Galene feels
she has touched an enthusiastic public
response. Now she has applied for a
N.S.W. Government cultural grant. “I
want to give local dancers, choreog-
raphers, scenic artists, and composers a
real opportunity to express themselves,
but dance needs money more than any
of the other arts. A writer needs pencil
and paper, a painter needs canvas and
paints, but a choreographer needs
bodies and they have to be paid.”
Ruth Galene choreographed all four
ballets in her first program. One of
them, “Adagio Albinoni,” already had
been presented by a company in Eng-
land; another, “Improvisations on a
Stairway,” was based on a Charles
Higham poem and scored by Sydney
musician Charlie Munro. The major
work, “There Is a Mountain,” was
an ambitious ballet based on Exodus,
danced to Lalo Shiffram’s “Jazz Mass.”
“We are not setting out to compete
with the Australian Ballet, merely to
use the styles of classical ballet, modern
dance, jazz, and folk dance to express
this age of contrasts better than the
classics alone do.”

leaching Maoris how
to be Maoris
An apprentice carver at work on a traditional panel
Kura Waaka heads an institute dedicated to Maori culture
By APRIL HERSEY
INTEGRATION of the Maoris, New
Zealand’s main claim to international
fame, is now threatening the New Zea-
land tourist industry. There isn’t enough
traditional color left for the tourists in
the old tribal regions, deserted for the
attractions of town and city. To put the
clock back and recover what has all but
been lost of the most remarkable of the
Polynesian cultures, an experiment in
Integration in reverse is under way in
clubs and schools where the young can
be taught by the few who still remember
what it means fully to be a Maori.
While seven percent of the popula-
tion is still statistically Maori, and
reproducing twice as fast as the Pakehas,
there are hardly any full-blooded Maoris
left.
Will all the traditions, legends, and
culture and 600 years of development
within New Zealand disappear among
the placid farmlands and the busy
towns, lost not at the museum level but
in the minds of the Maoris themselves?
The orators and story-tellers meant to
preserve the legends watch “Corona-
tion Street” on television instead. The
haka is much less interesting than
Rugby.
Even the traditional country ways of
the Maoris are going, as now only 50
percent live anywhere near their ori-
ginal tribal regions. The rest have
drifted away to become absorbed com-
pletely into the ways of an urban
community. The only lip service paid
to the traditions is to belong to a Maori
Cultural Club, and here the young
Maoris are indoctrinated into the
twirling of poi, war dances like the haka,
and powhiri (dances of greeting and
welcome), though once the session at
the cultural club is'- over the Maoris
make a bee-line for their favorite disco-
theque. Their natural inclination to sing
in close harmony and their effortless
ability to learn musical instruments has
brought them to the forefront of the
pop world. There are more Maoris
wired electronically for sound in New
Zealand than there are white pop stars.
Within the school structure there is
a determined effort to establish Maori
clubs so that, even if the children have
no continuance of traditions at home,
something will cling of the soft Maori
language with its predominant vowels
and some remnants of a fascinating
past will be retained. Paradoxically
these clubs are very popular with the
European children. The Maoris them-
selves are for the most part happy
enough to drift along.
There were some pioneers who
recognised this danger long ago. As
early as 1846 George French Angas,
an artist, so deplored the disappearance
of the natural culture of the Maori that
he tried to produce a visual catalogue
of their tribal life before it vanished,
and it was just as well he did, since the
Maoris themselves are now using this
as a kind of Bible. At the Maori Arts
and Crafts Institute at Rotorua the
book is preserved in an enormous glass
case.
Kura Waaka, a sturdy Maori public
servant chosen for his administrative
ability to direct the institute, turns the
pages ceremoniously from illustration
to illustration but has obviously never
been closer to 'the scenes depicted than
the tourist.
“There has hardly been anything
done to record our history since this
man in 1846,” he commented. “Think-
ing people over the years, both Maori
and European, have worried, but
nothing concrete was done until 1963
when this institute was formed by Act
of Parliament.”
The thermal reserve at Whakare-
warewa, traditionally free to the public,
was handed back to the Maoris to
permit them to charge tourists in order
to re-establish some of their past. A
model village was reconstructed among
the sulphurous steam and a stick fence
erected to keep out the non-paying
customers. Maori “villagers” come
each day to play their parts. Maori
maidens change from mini to reed
skirts and act as guides.
Next to the steaming village, a
wilderness of scrub mimosa and uneven
ground was cleared and levelled in a
matter of months to make way for the
modern institute building. Kura Waaka
(Maori for Walker) is very proud of
the speed with which the administra-
tion block went up. “It cost $63,000
and we are repaying it at percent.
We didn’t have a black penny to start
with —but we got loans and grants.”
Already $7OOO in debt on operating
costs in the first financial year, the
institute hopes soon to have classes of
young girls to instruct in plaiting and
weaving.
“We want to start classes for women
while there is still someone left to teach
them,” Kura Waaka said. “They are
being taught a little in schools now—
but the variety of weaving designs and
patterns will be lost if we don’t act
soon.” ?
The first art to be rescued was
naturally enough wood carving, which
the original Maori settlers brought to
such a fine delicacy when they dis-

covered the softwood totara growing in
their new land. Historians believe their
tradition of carving goes back beyond
the 14th century to the great adze and
chisel-makers of 1000 years ago. The
New Zealand greenstone was sharpened
to make tools, but the stone adze was
more frequently used.
The original tribal carvers were in
a priestly class, surrounded by “tapus”
or religious quarantine while working,
and the thought of being a carver would
have been enough to turn a 19th-
century Maori lad ecstatic with joy.
But today only about 20 carvers remain.
One of these (“The best” according
to Kura) is John Taiapa, a fiercely
self-contained artist who teaches his
seven apprentices with an abrasive
cynicism, chips flying round him like
furious confetti. The boys were chosen
throughout the land by the Maori
Council, who looked for boys between
15 and 18 who wanted to learn to
carve. They found them—one from
each of the major tribes, fortunately,
and most of them not knowing which
end of a chisel to use —equipped them
with very large panels because “Maori
art is never small,” invested in 14 sets of
chisels from Germany (40 chisels to a
set) and put them to the trade of their
ancestors. Despite their non - Maori
looks, sideburns, purple shirts, tattoos,
and the fact that they are very much
a part of their generation they are
going well. They all had to join the
carpenters’ union, of course, and be
paid the proper apprentice’s award,
whatever wood they were handling, and
whatever they were doing with it.
“You see,” Kura said. “Now what
was in the mind of only one man will
be in the minds of seven. Soon their
work will be used in public buildings
all over New Zealand.”
Approaching Taiapa very cautiously,
since men of inferior rank and women
were once forbidden to watch a carver
at work, I asked him where he had
learnt his trade. “From the old ones,”
he said shortly, still working. Did he
feel sad that so much of the old life
and art was going? “The old life is
better gone,” he said. “Much better
to see these boys educated than stamp-
ing around with their tongues out.”
But didn’t he regret that his own art
was dying? “Art never dies,” he said.
“They don’t think the art of the Egyp-
tians is dead. Nor will the Maori art
die. It doesn’t matter if these boys
forget what they have learnt tomorrow.”
Would it worry him if they did not fol-
low the traditional ways, but continued
to carve in a more abstract fashion?
“They cannot change this,” he said,
jabbing out a shower of chips. “It is
already an abstract. If they carve in
a different way, then it is only some-
thing influenced by Maori art and not
Maori art.” Did he hope that the
boys would in turn teach others? “They
are learning a trade,” he said scorn-
fully. “Nothing more. They’ll do very
well with it. Because the architects
are finding that there is no indigenous
design in New Zealand if you discount
the Maori.”

Paris in the spring
By
JOHN
WEIGHTMAN
THERE was a time when, in spring,
English was the foreign language that
could be heard most frequently in the
streets of Paris. But the steep rise in
French prices and also, perhaps, the
feeling that Gaullist France is not
likely to enfold the English-speaking
tourist in a warm embrace, have pro-
duced a sharp change. During a fort-
night of cultural prospecting, I heard
no adult English voices at all, and even
American visitors seemed to be remark-
ably thin on the ground.
One of the obsessions of modern
France is that the national identity
is being profoundly changed by the
contemporary world. The General,
with a break in his voice, speaks of “my
old country” as if he were the only
defender of its spiritual integrity, at
the same time as he wants it to have
100 million inhabitants and the H-
Bomb. Even the General’s opponents
sound warnings about the invasion of
France by American capital. Linguistic
purists rail against the corruption of
the language by English and American
terms.
But is France really undergoing such
a dramatic change? The French still
tend to look upon Great Britain as a
stable entity, as a country of tradition,
conservatism and instinct, deeply rooted
in the past and full of inarticulate guile.
Yet it now appears to me that the
collapse of the imperial ethos has had
a much more profound effect on Great
Britain than any recent historical event
—even the German Occupation—has
had on France. Although the inter-
national balance of power has altered,
the French can continue to be essentially
what they were in the 19 th cen-
tury. After the Algerian rumpus they
have been able to drop their overseas
connections without any feeling of
shock, because they were always pri-
marily a European Power.
The French papers say that there is
a great deal more social freedom than
in the past, but there are no very
obvious signs of this. A typical con-
versation in a bourgeois salon may be
almost identical in tone with what it
was 30 years ago. French television,
which is apparently conceived as a
family medium, must strike any English
viewer as being rather old-fashioned
in manner and content. When we went
to the Theatre du Palais Royal to see a
revival of two minor plays by Sacha
Guitry (one about the light-hearted
duplicities of kept women and the other
a variation on the servant problem),
the audience seemed to enjoy the works
as if they were exactly contemporary,
and its comments would have been
appropriate at any time in the past half
century.
Similarly, although -the Sartrian
generation of French intellectuals has
never tired of pointing out that God
is dead, the windows of the big depart-
ment stores still have the same displays
of First Communion outfits and, on
Easter Sunday, the congregation at
Notre Dame overflowed on to the
square and was apparently the largest
in living memory.
My sense of the archaic quality and
durability of much of French life may
be partly an illusion, encouraged by the
fact that so many of our friends live
in flats in houses that date back at
least to the 17 th century, and
are usually built over the ruins of some
medieval structure, the cellars of which
survive. These old Parisian houses
are full of nooks and crannies and have
courtyards opening into still more secret
inner courtyards.
The inhabitants of these antique
dwellings all have cars, of course, which
they park high on the pavements and
drive with a sort of shoulder-shrugging
abandon. At weekends the big, sleek
automobile often acts as a link between
a 17th-century flat in Paris and an
equally 17th-century, but modernised,
farmhouse in the country. The car,
much more than television, is the
modern object in France, the appurten-
ance that none but a very few un-
orthodox spirits can do without.
A vicious and brilliant comment on
the Machine Age is Jean-Luc Godard’s
“Weekend,” which might have been a
masterpiece, if Godard had had the
patience to finish the film properly and
had not surrendered, as usual, to the
demon improvisation. It is a fantasy
about a rather crass and corrupt bour-
geois couple who drive off into the
country and, after a dazzling display of
bad motor-car manners, lose their
vehicle in an accident. They then find

Offices in all States
themselves stranded in a vast French
countryside, peopled by marauding
bands of young outlaws who pilfer the
cars wrecked along the roads and take
dead or live motorists as material for
their cannibalistic rites.
The message clearly is that the
motor-car, by encouraging pointless
mobility and aggressiveness, has led
back to primitivism. After some vividly
gruesome adventures, the heroine be-
comes the concubine of an outlaw chief
and, when we leave her, she is re-
flectively chewing a portion of her dead
husband, who has been fried in the cere-
monial pan along with a stolen pig “and
the remains of a few English tourists.”
Sooner or later, some French writer
was bound to introduce the motor-car
fully into literature, and to treat it with
the care that Paul Morand devoted to
sleeping-cars or Saint-Exupery to the
aeroplane. It appears to be a rule of
French life that every object must even-
tually produce its corresponding intel-
lectual structure. As it happens, during
the past few weeks, two novelists have
brought out books entirely devoted to
the motor-car. Paul Guimard’s “Les
Ghoses de la vie” is a minutely de-
tailed description of an accident involv-
ing three cars and in which the best
driver, and the one who was totally
within his rights, is killed. The theme,
which is developed without sentimen-
tality but with the intellectual precision
for which the French are justly famous,
Is the “senseless” tragedy which results
from gambling on speed and human
reactions.
The other book, “Auto,” by Pierre
Gascar, is more in the nature of an
essay on the psychology of the driver,
accompanied by a poetic description of
a long motor trip lasting from morning
to evening. M. Gascar’s thesis is fairly
all-embracing. He sees in the motor-car
a richly ambiguous object, which pro-
tects its occupant from direct contact
with reality, at the same time as it
exposes him to danger; it enhances
vitality and satisfies the death-wish; it
is both a womb and a projectile; its
owner is possessive about it and sees it
as an extension of himself, yet he is
always dreaming of a bigger and better
car, in a typically human desire to
transcend himself. Finally, for the child
of today, the prestige of the family car
is just as important a factor as the
Oedipus complex.
The avant-garde novel and cinema,
as exemplified in the latest productions
of Philippe Sobers and Alain Robbe-
G'rillet, have reached new heights of
abstruse preciosity, where I find the
atmosphere unbreathable. But the
theatrical avant-garde is more exciting
because Artaud’s principles of ritual
and terror still prevail. As one paper
put it, “nakedness, violence, and co-
pulation” are the order of the day.
At the Theatre des Arts, Arrabal’s
“Le Cimetiere des Voitures” (the motor-
car again, but in the form of pictur-
esque wrecks inhabited by outcasts) is
performed with tremendous brio on a
stage which encircles the auditorium.
The audience sits in the middle on re-
volving seats which allow them to fol-
low the wild gyrations of the athletic
cast, who act out a sort of Christ-
story, variegated with murder, necro-
philia, and sex. I don’t think I have
ever heard such loud noises or seen
more naked bodies at close quarters and
at such interesting angles in so short a
time. The impact may have been
rather confused, and the Lord Cham-
berlain would have died a thousand
deaths, but at least one felt one had
had an experience.
At the Cirque de Montmartre, “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream” is given
a slightly Artaud-like treatment. Ariane
Mnouchkine has produced the first
Shakespeare-on-fur. The arena is car-
peted with what appear to be goat-
skins, stitched together to form a con-
tinuous floor, on which the human
characters perform hieratic movements
and the fairies do earthy somersaults.
Mme Mnouchkine has taken the bold
step of turning Oberon, Puck, and their
attendant sprites into a homosexual
band, all naked, animal and cuddle-
some, while Titania is accompanied by
a retinue of men in ceremonial dress
and wearing masks, who stalk majes-
tically about like peacocks.
In middle-brow works, I notice a
slight development of that hardy old
social type —the picaresque hero or
heroine who was not born into respect-

able bourgeois society or who has opted
out of it. The character is less meta-
physical than a few years ago, when
the Absurd was all the rage, and now
oscillates between the attitude of the
pure, amoral parasite and that of the
quietist hippie.
In Claude Chabrol’s “Les Biches,”
set among the epicene delights of Saint-
Tropez, a rich lesbian keeps a court of
bisexual and homosexual parasites.
Tragedy sets in when both she and her
latest pick-up—a hippie-parasite who
answers only to the name of Why (in
English) are converted to hetero-
sexuality by an enterprising architect.
The rich woman wants to get rid of
Why, but the latter has by now become
so identified with high life and the per-
sonality of her protectress that she goes
mad and kills the rich woman.
In two further instances the scene is
set in America, but this is just a form
of exoticism and does not make the
characters any less French. Francoise
Sagan’s new novel, “Le Garde du
Coeur,” is the story of a middle-aged
female dialogist in Hollywood, who is
about to be married to a suitable
middle-aged man, when, by accident,
she picks up an incredibly handsome
young drifter and finds that she likes
looking after him. He is purely con-
templative and makes no compromises
with society, but happily his incredible
beauty allows him to earn money ad lib,
as a film star.
After a while, it transpires that he
is not only impotent but also slightly
mad because, in his attachment to the
middle-aged woman, he tends to murder
anyone who is hostile to her. She,
after cautioning the young man about
this alarming habit, marries her middle-
aged suitor and the three of them settle
down together as an interesting trio-
father, mother, and pseudo-lover-son.
The emotional parasitism remains clear,
although the financial parasitism has
been masked by a facile device.
Incidentally, the motor-car theme
pops up again here in a curious form:
the young man buys a stately Rolls-
Royce, which they never drive but
keep on the front lawn like a statue
or a symbol and carefully polish every
weekend.
All this may sound terribly advanced
and decadent and quite at variance with
what I said before about the continu-
ance of the bourgeois spirit. But I
don’t think there is any contradiction,
and I see these works as being pri-
marily bourgeois entertainment. The
bisexual parasite is probably just a more
up-to-date version of the kept woman,
who was a staple character in French
plays and novels all during the 19th
century and the earlier part of this one.
The French, with their keen sense
of the separation of the genres in life
as well as in art, may go in a family
party to watch a display of non-bourgeois
behaviour, just as their acceptance of
Catholicism may leave their bourgeois
social principles quite untouched. In
other words, culture may be comple-
mentary to life, as well as expressive of
it.

BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY
The best news for months
THE SOAKING RAINS of the past
week are the best news for the economy
for many months. They lay a very
solid basis for next financial year’s
rural income and, of course, rural in-
come is not very different a word from
export earnings. Pastures, stock water,
wheatland, and irrigated crops all will
benefit enoi J mously from the down-
pours. The real benefits will not be
seen in the balance of payments until
well into 1969, but that is no less
reason to be happy. For the men in
the Treasury have to look about that
far ahead in their formulation of
present policy.
The rains mean that they will be
putting balance of payments out of
mind as a factor in the Budget. With-
out those rains and with rural pros-
pects still looking poor they would
have been far more inclined to apply
the brakes a little to the economy
now in order to strengthen the balance-
of-payments position as we go into
next year.
Export income this year is unlikely
to be much over $3OOO million, but
the rise next financial year should be
-very substantial. Mineral exports alone
are thought certain to rise from $5OO
million to over $7OO ’million, and given
a continuing strong growth of manu-
factures, the non-rural element in our
export income might go up by close
on $3OO million. Even if most of the
cash flow from the rains does not
accrue until late next year there will
by some benefits, and, together with a
bit of luck with wool prices, rural
exports in 1967-68 should grow by at
least $lOO million. So $3400 million
is a relatively conservative estimate for
export income next year.
Some very high figures for imports
bave, however, been bandied around.
Next financial year is the big year for
foreign - defence equipment, which
means the F-111. If the Government
goes ahead with the purchase and
that is only an even-money bet it
will have between $lOO million and
$l5O million extra to pay on the
swingwing bomber fleet alone. Busi-
ness capital spending is still relatively
restrained outside mining at least
and could well rise strongly next year.
Already non-dwelling construction is
rising and the installation of plant
and machinery (where import content
is high) is likely to follow. The Mel-
bourne Institute of Applied Economic
Research puts the rise at $BB million
on $768 million. That ’may be too
low an increase. Others think it could
easily be up 15 percent, which would
put the rise at more than $lOO million.
All in all it is not unlikely that the
total import bill will rise by $4OO
million, the same amount as exports.
The trade balance looks like staying
pretty constant.
Over the long term, Australia has to
earn a trade surplus in order to finance
at least some of the inevitably large
invisibles bill (principally freight),
but for the time being it looks as
though capital inflow will be the only
offsetting item.
Astonishingly, in the financial year
just ending it looks as though there
will be hardly any loss of international
reserves even allowing for the $ll3
million which went with sterling.
Although we have been saying for a
long time that capital inflow could
not continue, it must be said even
'more emphatically now for 1968-69.
But the events of the past month
are enough to demonstrate that despite
British and American measures of
official restriction, it is still possible to
get a lot of money here.
We will be unlucky not to get $6OO
million next year, which, if the deficit
Water. .. Too much is better than not enough
on invisibles is $BOO million, will leave
a $2OO million fall to be borne by
reserves.
If, as is still possible, the F-11l
order is cancelled, the country could
maintain its international reserves at
their present comfortable level.
In any case, few people are pessimis-
tic about the balance of payments from
1970 onward. An exception is Dr.
J. O. N. Perkins in an article in a
recent issue of the “Econo’mic Record,”
basing his projections on an extra-
ordinarily pessimistic prediction of
rural exports growing at 3.25 percent,
and a conservative estimate of an 8.5
percent annual growth in minerals and
manufactures. In addition, it assumes
a saving of only $135 million on re-
placement of imported oil, with a
guess that total imports will rise by
8.5 percent a year. It is, therefore, not
surprising that he foresees huge prob-
lems in the ’seventies.
But to most it will look an exces-
sively gloo'my view of the future. For
one thing rural exports have, despite
the difficulties of competition from
synthetics and protectionism, managed
to grow by six percent a year over
the past decade. Why should these
obstacles grow so much more quickly?
Things would be drastic indeed if the
growth rate of our rural exports were
halved, but there is no sign of that.
Dr. Perkins seems to be scratching
for figures to justify his argument for
devaluation.
Pan American Airways
End of an era
THE TROUBLES through which many
aviation companies, both on the flying
and the manufacturing side, have
passed in the last decade can in many
cases be directly attributed to the fact
that they had been founded in the
late 1920 s and early 1930 s by young
men who were short then on money,
but strong on vision and who had
grown with the passing of the years
into old men with a lot of money
and no vision, but who still retained
control of the companies they had
founded. The Douglas dynasty, Howard
Hughes, Eddie Rickenbacker, they all
went under pressure from alarmed in-
vestors. But not Juan Trippe.
Juan Trippe started what became
Pan American World Airways when he
was 28 and had $300,000; long before
that he had been running charter ser-
vices. He retired this week at 68 with


his reputation for shrewdness and
driving efficiency as high as it has ever
been. Pan Am is difficult to imagine
without him. He might have with-
drawn earlier from the active running
of the airline (until this week he was
still chief executive) had he not had
exceptionally bad luck in choosing a
successor. One of his heirs apparent,
John Leslie, was cruelly incapacitated
with polio just at the time of his pro-
motion; another, Roger Lewis, was
taken away to salvage the General
Dynamics company from a series of
huge losses.
The man who now takes over, Harold
Gray, is only six years younger than
Mr. Trippe himself and was for a good
many years a Pan American pilot. This
fits with the current feeling that it is
no bad thing for an airline chief in
these times of rapid technical change to
know something about how aircraft
work. More surprising is the decision
to give Mr. Gray’s old job of president
of the airline to Mr. Najeeb Halaby,
late of the Federal Aviation Agency,
and an ex-test pilot whose Washington
career was more conspicuous for his
enthusiasm than his judgment. But like
all American airline chiefs, Mr. Trippe
was a great believer in knowing what
was up at the Capitol; Mr. Halaby’s
job presumably is to man the radar.
MEN AND MATTERS
THIS IS no ordinary retirement; the
departure of Lance Duly and Wally
Hansford from Duly and Hansford
marks the end of an era. After 48
years of close and harmonious associa-
tion, C. L. Duly and W. H. Hansford
are leaving the board of the automotive
valve and axle business bearing their
family names, following its sale (with
some regret) to Cam-Gears/TRW Pty.
Ltd., the Australian subsidiary of TRW
Inc., of America.
Lance Duly retires to the bowling
green, and Wally Hansford to a lj-acre
garden of azaleas and camellias on Pitt-
water, and an occasional fishing excur-
sion from the beach or out in a small
skiff. But their services have been
retained as consultants to the firm,
which Wally and Lance’s fathers
founded in 1921.
And the family associations continue
with Wally’s sons, Norman and young
Wal Hansford (identical twins of 45),
superintending the axle department and
estimating respectively, young Lance
Duly as general manager of operations,
and Bill Duly, son of C. L.’s brother
Alf (one-time chairman and managing
Lance Duly
Wally Hansford
director, who died four years ago),
working as sales manager.
The romance of a business which
Began as a partnership with initial
capital of £2500 and has just now been
sold for nearly $6 million is the story,
in essence, of Australia’s industrialisa-
tion.
C. L. Duly was educated to go on
the land, as his mother’s family had
property near Armidale. During World
War I, brother Alf joined up, but Lance
went into the engineering trade in
Sydney. Wally Hansford served his
apprenticeship at the Clyde Engineering
Company, then worked at the Railway
workshop and Mulgrave sugar mills at
Gordonvale, in Queensland, and went
into partnership with his brother Roy
growing sugarcane. In 1915 he went
to work at Father Shaw’s Wireless
works at Randwick, started by a priest
who tinkered with wireless. It was then
making shells and portable wireless
generating pack sets for the Middle
East.
Here he struck up the lifelong friend-
ship with Lance Duly. After the war
Lance and his father were financially
interested in the Automatic Engineer-
ing Company, which folded, but Mr.
Duly, senior, proposed a partnership
with Wally Hansford, and in 1920 they
began production of bolts and nuts in
the backyard of the Duly family home,
“Dundry,” at Kogarah.
Duly, senior, started the machines at
6 a.m., and Wally came on the job at
7.30; “father” would have a nap in the
middle of the day, and they would
carry on until 9 p.m. Alf and Lance
Duly, Wally’s contemporaries, helped
voluntarily before and after their own
jobs.
When Alf Duly joined the business
he looked after accounts and sales, and
Lance and Wally took care of the
“practical” side, engineering and pro-
duction, while Duly, senior, was general
factotum.
The long, hard grind of coaxing
ancient machinery to operate, and get-
ting orders from firms reluctant to
believe that Australia could do more
than blacksmithing, continued, with
steel being impoi'ted from England, and
brought from the wharves by six-horse
teams to Kogarah. They eventually
encouraged the establishment of the
bright drawn steel industry in Austra-
lia.
In 1924 the business outgrew
Kogarah and moved to Tempe, where
General Motors and A. H. Peters
eventually became neighbors. Next
move was into engine valves, and Duly
and Hansford became the largest valve
maker in Australia. The trade name,
Dufor, combining the two founders’
names, was adopted in 1930. Forgings
and axles came next, and by 1935 the
partnership was incorporated as Duly
and Hansford Ltd.
World War II hastened the indus-
trialisation process. Duly and Hansford
made two-pounder shells and anti-
aircraft fuses, which it was able to
produce at lower cost than in England.
Women entered the machine shop
during the war years, and they still
form a large section of the staff, cur-
rently numbering 980, male and
female, of which no less than 90 have
25 years’ service.
The company became a proprietary
one in 1937, and achieved public status
in 1949, with paid capital of $600,000.
After the war the company took over
the plant it wanted from the Govern-
ment, and the business developed more
and more into automotive' parts.
The first link with TRW, the firm
which eventually swallowed them, was a
licensing agreement in 1957 to make
valves. TRW’s 1967 sales totalled $925
million, its profit $3B million, from
advanced-technology products and ser-
vices in the automotive, space, aviation,
electronics, and defence fields. In Aus-
tralia, apart from Cam-Gears, it also
owns Carr Fasteners Pty. Ltd., of
Adelaide, which is a substantial supplier
to the auto industry.
Overseas capital
Germany's interest
WHEN Dr. Jur. H. A. Wuttke, the dis-
tinguished German financier, was out
here in 1965 for the Melbourne Stock
Exchange’s spectacular investment
symposium he was somewhat less
enthusiastic than most of the other over-
seas guests invited about dotting the
i’s and crossing the t’s of the “fantas-
tic” investment prospects we were offer-
ing to overseas capital. To put it
mildly, he was very cautious in extol-
ling our economic attractions and when
he returned he was still unconvinced
that Australia was an open sesame for
West Germany’s investors. Unfortun-
ately for us, his message got home and
since then, with but a few shining
exceptions such as Hoechst (which in
the interim has built a valuable imports-
saving high-density polyethylene plant
here), his country has been a reluctant
suitor of our economic prospects, even,
in the case of its $4O million or so
Volkswagen investment, retracing one
of its earlier jaunty steps.
In the roll up, though West Ger-
many’s consular officials shy off putting
a figure on it, the country’s fixed in-
vestment here can’t amount to much
more than, say, $lOO million (exclusive,
of course, of the Schering confiscated
pharmaceutical assets, still a thorn in
the flesh of West German attitudes
toward investing in Australia). Oddly
enough, practically all of this is located
in Melbourne, where the eight or so

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
German-controlled industrial firms had
joint ventures (such as BASK’s with
Dow at Altona), have elected to build
their plants. Most of them are in
the motor accessories and chemicals
fields, such as Bosch, Vedo, Hella, and
Siemens in the former and Hoechst,
Annakin Soda Fabriken, and Cologne
Perfumery in the latter. Apart from
these, numerous West German firms,
such as Bayer, which is at present think-
ing of developing its agency into manu-
facturing operation, have agencies in
Australia which help to keep the con-
siderable visible trade between our two
countries usually pretty well balanced,
at least allowing for considerable re-
exports of our wool to Germany from
Britain.
Like other Western European coun-
tries, our minerals potential has awak-
ened slumbering German investors who
have recently been channelling funds
into Australian mining shares (mostly
through London) as well as prompting
more direct interest in its development.
So when The Bulletin contacted Mr.
W. H. J. Barr, local representative of
the giant German Metallgesellschaft
A.G., which recently linked with
Comalco in the consortium to build
an alumina refinery in Sardinia, he was
about to take off for Western Australia,
■where most of the present mining plums
are. Mr. Barr, who runs the Lurgi
show here (its German parent is a
Metallgesellschaft subsidiary), has re-
cently returned to Australia after a
year’s familiarisation run round the
group in West Germany, where it is, of
course, that country’s biggest industrial
complex with well-secured tentacles in
the U.S., Canada, and Japan.
The parent was founded in 1881 as
a metals and ore trader but has since
spread its interests into mining, non-
ferrous metals production, chemicals,
transportation, metals fabrication, tech-
nical processes, and scientific research.
Mr. Barr says that in particular it is
looking for lead-copper-zinc and nickel
propositions in Australia and would not
wink at solid industrial opportunities
either. As well as being linked with
Comalco in the Sardinia consortium it
is Hamersley’s agent for iron-ore sales
in West Germany.
Door-to-door salesmen
Feeling the pinch
TOR ONCE in a while the Con-
sumers’ Protection Council in Victoria,
a statutory body operating under the
Consumers’ Protection Act, is able to
report that one of the nefarious
practices it’s been hounding since its
formation three years ago is on the
wane in the State. It has recorded its
“'impression” that the community is get-
ting wiser to “set-up man callers,” the
chaps whose opening gambit at the
housewife’s door has a variety of
deceptive slants, such as “I am not sell-
ing you anything . . .” “I am doing a
survey for . . “In fact, I’m working
with the advertising manager, who
wants to make you a very special offer,”
and so forth, when, in fact, he either
wants to sell something himself or pre-
pare the ground for the “follow-up”
man.
If you make an appointment for the
follow-up man to call on you, says the
Consumers’ Protection Council, you are
in for it: you will get the whole selling
works, and probably be left holding a
very expensive baby.
Although the Council thinks such
selling methods are on the wane, they
are still prevalent enough for it to
have launched yet another attack on
them, prompted not so much by the
fact that they are, in its view,
“objectionable to business .people,” but
rather, perhaps, that so many genuine
market research people are getting tired
of having doors slammed in their faces.
It is a moot point whether “they
damage the reputation of the products
involved in the rackets,” but if they do,
who cares?
Japan-Australia trade
Prawns in the swim
A MINNOW, perhaps, alongside the
Robe River project and its pleasant
implications for the future expansion
of exports to Japan and inter-country
business co-operation and all that, but
Australia is also getting into double
harness with Japan in the prawn busi-
ness. Last week Gollin Holdings, a big
Melbourne-based international trading
concern, which has had a trading- office
in Japan for four years, announced that
it had started a joint venture with the
Japanese firm Kyokuyo Hogei to fish
for prawns off northern Australia..
In this small but promising begin-
ning Japan is taking a majority (55
percent) interest and Gollin the
minority (45 percent) in Gollin
Kyokuyo, the new company being
formed. No figure was put on the pro-
posed capitalisation of the new com-
pany, but initially it will be pretty
small and probably increased if the
undertaking, which includes processing,
packaging, and marketing the catches,
turns out profitably.
At the outset the intention is to use
vessels chartered from Kyokuyo for the
fishing, but if satisfactory profits are
made in the first two years the Japan-
ese fleet will be replaced by Australian
craft, and processing will be moved
from Japan to a shore-based plant to
be set up in northern Australia. Both
partners are already adept fish handlers.
Kyokuyo has had long experience in
the trawling and other sides of the busi-
ness, while Gollin, which a few years
ago acquired a small Melbourne com-
pany to market local fish, also is a
substantial exporter of Australian sea-
foods.

Selling off the backyard
—or giving it away?
THE DROLLERY of interstate politi-
cal rivalries apart, Queensland’s jubi-
lant announcement that come 1972 it
shall be Australia’s premier coal-ex-
porting State fell depressingly flat
amongst the US-Japanese rites which
officially opened Utah Development’s
Blackwater coal mine some 125 miles
inland from Rockhampton. Over the
next ten years something like 20 million
tons of top grade coking coal worth
$U.5.210 million will be shipped out
of this wholly-owned U.S. mine to
the steel and chemical works of Japan.
And this seems quite likely to be only
a beginning.
In an area of 1600 square miles
north of Blackwater, Utah, in collabora-
tion with Mitsubishi, are carrying out
extensive prospecting which has already
made the partnership “very confident”
in the future of the area. Sir Howard
Beale, former Australian Ambassador
to the U.S. and acting diplomat for
Utah on this particular occasion,
stressed that the matter was still very
much “sub judice.” But some idea of
the magnitude involved is perhaps
already reflected in the consideration
being given to the construction of a new
rail line to a new port to be built some-
where between Mackay and Rock-
hampton. The Japanese, for their part,
talk in terms of 4-5 million tons a
year from this area.
Queensland’s Premier Pizzey points
out that Utah and Mitsubishi have, as
yet, only been given “authority to pros-
pect.” He nevertheless foresees that by
1972 12 million tons a year of coal
will be exported from Queensland com-
pared with 8 million tons from N.S.W.
According to Japanese reports, 4-5
million tons are expected to come from
the Sirius Creek area to the north of
Blackwater, another U.S. project con-
trolled by Clutha Development, a
member of the D. K. Ludwig Group.
Reserves in this area are put at 147
million tons and there is more talk
of new rail links with the coast and
new port facilities. To the west of
Blackwater at Bl\iff, an Australian-
American consortium comprising
Associated Oil, Conzinc Rio Tinto,
Kaiser Steel, and Pickands Mather are
exploring under the supervision of
Pickands Mather, and the Japanese are
speaking in terms of 2-3 million tons a
year from here. BHP and Bellambi are
Mining coal at Blackwater
both active in the area, but the con-
trolling interest in the promised 12
million tons a year of coal to be ship-
ped to Japan by 1972 will be very
much American.
Queensland’s gain will be, perhaps,
the growth of a few towns, new port
facilities, several hundred new jobs, a
hundred or so miles of new rail line,
new rolling stock, and a questionable
lift in status. The State will foot a
large proportion of the bill for this
expansion.
It is understandable that Premier
Pizzey feels strongly about people who
accuse Australia of “selling off its
backyard.” He points out that such
talk can give potential overseas invest-
ors cold feet and he is concerned to

give them every assurance that as far
as Queensland is concerned the in-
roads for foreign capital are wide open.
Without such encouragement, he be-
lieves, the economic growth of the
country will be irreparably damaged.
With it, Blackwater, says Utah, will
eventually involve a capital investment
of $3O million “an epic drama of
development and decentralisation is
being unveiled.”
The accusations and talk which
Premier Pizzey abhors are not directed
against development through foreign
capital, which is welcome, but against
takeover; they are concerned that Aus-
tralia should receive the maximum
benefits possible from its natural re-
sources while still maintaining an at-
tractive profitability for foreign in-
vestments. There is nothing wrong in
selling off the backyard, goes the
argument, but it is stupid to give it
away.
The discordant voices become in-
creasingly loud. Mr. McMahon has
been lately moved to have dark thoughts
on the possibility of restricting the
movement of foreign capital once it
has been imported. In the circumstances
would Utah be prepared, say, to admit
local equity into any future Queensland
coal projects?
Mariner Stoddard Eccles, the chair-
man of the parent company, Utah Con-
struction and Mining, come hot from
Salt Lake City for the occasion,
thought, on the whole, not. Yes, he was
conscious of the want for local equity
participation, “but it will have to
depend on our need for capital.” Such
a need is unlikely ever to become a par-
ticularly pressing one. Utah Construc-
tion is booming with a record profit last
year of SU.S.I6 million and a backlog
mineral sales in the region of
of $U.5.1,100,100 million. It is led by a
financier of the rarest water —Mr. Eccles
has followed a career through the
Federal Reserve Board, the pioneering
of the International Monetary Fund,
the U.S. Advisory Council on Inter-
national and Financial Problems, the
Export-Import Bank, and the 1958-61
U.S. Commission on Money and Credit.
And, anyway, Mr. Eccles believes that
Australia has nothing to worry about; its
economic independence is not in jeo-
pardy; it should seek confirmation of the
benefits of foreign investment by taking
a look at how European money put
America on its feet, back in the early
days. If Blackwater mine illustrated
anything, said Mr. Eccles, it was the
mutual interdependence of capital,
natural resources, and markets.
U.S. and Japanese representatives,
Premier Pizzey, and members of his
Cabinet beamed their approval and
praised one another. The Rev. J. M.
Wilson of Rockhampton invoked the
spirit of prudence and wise councils.
And, as the drums rolled, the hooters
blew, and another train-load of coal
pulled out for Japan, the Australian
flag was ceremoniously hoisted over
Blackwater, to become firmly and
ominously strangled at the top of the
mast.

wafer piped under the sea to save a million dollars
The Spencer Gulf submarine pipeline an internationally
acclaimed engineering triumph is the new lifeline of
industrial Whyalla. For 40 years her shipyards, steelworks,
furnaces relied on the old Morgan-Whyalla pipeline which
skirted the top of Spencer Gulf.
Today, at a saving of more than a million dollars, the new
pipeline crosses the bed of the Spencer Gulf, reducing
the distance of the old pipeline by 44 miles.
Preparations for this challenging engineering feat took
18 months. Laying of the seven-mile pipeline 70 feet
beneath the sea took one week.
Principal contractors, Dillingham Constructions, won the
1967 Construction Achievement Award for this remarkable
project.
Humes Limited, a major contractor, fabricated the seven
miles of 33" diam. pipe from 7/16-in. steel plate at the
company’s Adelaide plant.
The contract included: • ultrasonic scanning and proof
X-raying of the circumferential welds • hydrostatic test-
ing to 750 psi • spinning a 3 A-in. thick concrete lining
• application of 3/16-in. enamel coating for corrosion
protection.
The Spencer Gulf Submarine Pipeline will serve to
develop Whyalla for decades to come.
Pipes bring our water, gas, oil, chemicals, bring us our prosperity.

THE IFS AND BUTS OF
SPECULATING ON THE
FUTURE PRICE OF GOLD
BY J. C. HORSFALL
LIKE MONTAGUE NORMAN
whose biography by Andrew Boyle,
published by Cassell, recently reached
these shores financial writers can
be hung for an ounce of gold. If they
have any sense they at least should
draw the line at predicting the future
price of it, here or anywhere else. When
the two-tier system was introduced a
couple of months ago a prominent
merchant banker bet me the free price
would about double. And when it
scampered down as the speculators un-
loaded, a sensible fellow I know who’d
bought gold shares, thinking he couldn’t
lose, burned his fingers badly. However,
for all his tinkering with gold I doubt
whether Montague Norman would have
fallen into the trap the “Age” did in
predicting a $4 rise in the local price
when Mr. McMahon freed the market
in gold for industrial use here and
left itself wide open to be told by the
“Herald” only half a day later that
the price had dropped by $1 an ounce.
One has the sneaking feeling that
Mr. McMahon must be disappointed
with this result, as undoubtedly he had
hoped that Australian gold producers
would benefit from his getting the
Reserve Bank out of the industrial gold
business and so relieve the Treasury
from at least part of the burden of
paying subsidies to them. The relief
could never have been all that sub-
stantial but at least every little is
apparently going to help next year
when, as he predicted last week,
Government spending on defence is
going to rise strongly.
Misled though they may have been
at the first effects of the switch in
industrial gold trading, neither Mr.
McMahon nor the “Age” need despair
that a triumphant “Herald” will neces-
sarily have the last word or that future
bridegrooms here won’t eventually have
to pay more for their wedding rings.
The authorities didn’t leave the gate
open for gold imports to supply some
of the local industrial gold market as
an idle gesture. That is one thing.
Another is that the fate of gold as
an international means of exchange is
still wide open. I’m not saying that
it will necessarily work out that France
will win the day in the international
gold arena as it most certainly did
in the titanic battle between Norman
and Moreau (then Governor of the
Bank of France) forty or so years ago.
But at least France has the ammunition,
as it had then, to keep the pressure
on the overvalued pound and the dollar
and to have an even chance of success
before we get round to universal ac-
ceptance of IMF paper as a substitute
for the yellow metal.
Although one may be all in favor
of wishing gold into the backwaters
of industrial use, where, in the event
of its absolute dethronement as an
international means of exchange, it
could become dirt cheap, the inter-
national monetary world is in such
poor shape that the case for using it
at a substantially higher price as a
stabiliser has gained rather than lost
in strength over the past year not
that at the moment France, which has
as large a supply of the metal as any
country outside the U.S., is a particu-
larly good example of stability despite
it having the whip hand over the
pound and the dollar. As it was in
Norman’s critical 1925-1931 period
when against the heavy odds of France’s
clawing and procrastination in fixing
a gold parity for the franc he tried
and failed to keep the overvalued
pound on the restored (1925) pre-war
gold standard, the critical question for
the future use of gold as international
money now could still be international
agreement on the price at which it
might be used in foreign exchange
equations.
Gold, anyway, still has a decided
kick in it even if for the moment
the Australian gold industry is no less
a pensioner of the Federal Treasury
than it was before Mr. McMahon de-
cided to free the market in industrial
gold. Taken together with earlier moves
to cash in on the premiums still avail-
able on the second tier of the two-level
gold-price system, the latest step shows,
as indeed Australian support of South
Africa’s long-standing efforts at the
IMF espousing the case for a higher
price of gold does, that the Australian
gold industry hasn’t been given up as
a lost cause by the Government. That
is sensible, because, despite its equally
favorable view (not that it often gets
much of a word in at the big inter-
national currency clubs to express it)
of the efficacy of international paper
money, the industry remains a very
useful asset in many ways. Not the least
of these is that even at $U.5.35 an
ounce it still contributes a handy sum
every year to our international reserves
and that the contribution stands to be
increased substantially with a big in-
crease in the price on either tier of
the two-tier price structure, say, not
only from an increase in price itself
but also from the stimulus this would
give to production and search for ad-
ditional gold deposits.
So while in its marginal present
state the gold industry is pretty ex-
pensive of resources it could well have
an expanding and more profitable
future both in its own and in the
national scheme of things. We should
certainly keep cossetting it, at least un-
til, if that is to happen, the die of gold
is cast as an international medium of
exchange. If that day should come it
will be some comfort, especially for
those who live and work on the golden
mile, that the proliferation of other
metal discoveries is projecting even
more profitable lines of employment,
both of men and material resources.

The economy: Widespread rain in eastern States
brought forecasts of the best start to the winter pastoral
and agricultural season in Queensland for more than a
decade, and possibilities for a record wheat-sowing
acreage in New South Wales.
Australia’s wool cheque for ten months to April was
down $5O million or 8.49 percent.
The Reserve Bank pointed out that Australian interest
rates remained steady, while overseas, especially
North America, they continued to rise. Trading Bank
advances made the largest increase ever recorded
($l5O million) in April, hitting a peak of $3504 million.
Transferable certificates of deposit issued by the
Australian Resources Development Bank are adjudged
the most significant development in Australian
money markets.
The markets: In a week when gold soared to a new
peak and sterling subsided to a new low, brokers had
managed to get back to normal by Friday in London.
An accumulation of unfavorable economic news
prompted a fairly widespread decline during active trading
on Wall Street on Friday, but the close of the week
showed that the retreat had been a modest one.
On Australian share markets, brokers struggled to
maintain the frantic pace demanded by clients, and
operators were afflicted with laryngitis. Tuesday and
'Wednesday total turnover posted records of 4.48 million,
then 4.71 million shares traded.
On the specific recommendation of one Melbourne broker
Mt. Isa sold as high as $8.70, a record, and $3.85 above
the closing price for 1967. With London warning of
the quicksands of Murphyores, this stock lost 75c from
its early peak of $4.30.
Stags of the week, Southern Pacific Petroleum, Central
Pacific Mining (both from the Magellan stable), and
Cultus, gave speculators a killing. Southern’s 50c shares
were as high as 90c, but the 10c contribs sold to 55c,
Central’s 50c went to 75c, but the 25c contribs again
gave the better reward, selling to 60c, while Cultus’
25c shares sold to 60c.
In such a feverish market rumors abounded, mainly
regarding nickel finds supposedly by Great Boulder, Timor,
and Amalgamated Petroleum. They were strong
enough, anyhow, to put Boulders up to $10.50.
Silver Valley had a meteoric rise on Friday to $3.25,
declining to $3 by close.
Industrials hardly got a look in, although food stocks
Petersville and Big Sister came in for more than passing
interest, the latter announcing a possible merger with
another Australian company, which was not Petersville.
Companies .' Even the Myer colossus has felt keenly
competitive conditions and abnormal seasons in many
States ... in the half-year to January group profit
was only steady.
The last of the family wrangles was staged at Mark Foy’s
annual meeting. The board accepted the takeover offer
of the more peaceable McDowells.
Trading activities of the H. G. Palmer electrical chain
have been sharply reduced since December, as the
receiver closed down up to 60 percent of the stores which
were operating when he took over in October, 1965.
Down south, Cox Finance will pay 10c in the $ on
June 7 to its debenture holders, making 70c in all.
The “first come, first served” technique is now being-
applied to Talcott Factors, the offer being 30c for about
10 percent of the capital.
Brambles’ 50 percent interest in Breckett should bring
higher dividends to the transport group. Its profit in
the year to December rose 37 percent, and dividends went
up from $840,000 to $l.l million.
Ampol’s $6 million debenture issue was over-subscribed
by $2.2 million, and the surplus will be returned.
Caltex converted a loss of $550,000 into a profit of
$3.6 million in 1967. Chrysler shared in the new buoyancy
of the Australian vehicle market, turning in a record
profit of $4.35 million compared with an adjusted
$3.95 million for the year to November 30, i 966.
N.Z. Forest Products lifted dividend from 9 to 10 percent
in the year to March, as profit rose from $4,156,000
to $4,510,000.
A subsidiary of the D. K. Ludwig group, National
Bulk Carriers, will take a half interest in a new company
to be formed to take over the Robe River iron-ore
project in Western Australia from Cleveland Cliffs.
Cleveland Cliffs, of Ohio, will share a 25 percent interest
with Mitsui, and Australian interests will take the
remaining 25 percent.
Mining Traders has increased its stake in Barrier
Exploration to 36.6 percent, and Barrier has entered a new
joint venture with Metals Ex and Freeport of Australia
to investigate a nickel prospect 10 miles north-east
of Kalgoorlie.
The latest nickel stock is that most unlikely candidate
Latec Investments, motelier-builder and ex-financier,
which is only negotiating for an indirect 5 percent interest
in a mining syndicate, but this was sufficient for a run
on the shares from 29 to 42c . . . while Latec chairman
and managing director, Mr. P. A. Malouf, was negotiating
on his own behalf for an option over mineral leases
near Kambalda.
A doubling of capital is contemplated by Pacific Island
Mines, with a one-for-one issue of 25c to finance
diversification.

Speculator’s Diary
ASSUMING THAT THE
GRAVY TRAIN STILL
HAS SOME WAY TO GO
WILL IT BOOM or will it bust? The
question is on all lips and the answer
on none. However, on one point there
does seem to be general agreement;
as long as money continues to flow in
from overseas as it is flowing now prices
cannot help but be forced up. And at
present there looks to be no letup in
sight. Money is currently flowing as
freely and generously as heatwave beer.
In fact, one source has estimated that
it’s coming in at the daily rate of $3
million. Under these conditions it would
seem that the only logical thing to do
is to climb on to the bandwagon and
enjoy the ride. The only trick, of
course, is to know when to get off.
Still, with the recent formation of two
large blue-blooded investment funds in
Europe to take advantage of the Aus-
tralian situation, it would seem that
perhaps the gravy train still has some
way to go.
A company that looks as though it’s
still got a way to go, present conditions
prevailing, is Alliance Oil Development
NL. The company is a purely technical
buy (as must most oils be nowadays)
but a good one. Firstly, the company
has an active drilling program outlined
for the next few months. The fact alone
means that if the market continues in
its usual mood, and there seems little
doubt of this at the moment, the shares
will have a series of chances of rising
as a prelude to each spud-in. Secondly,
the company is attracting a good deal
of buying because of its offshore inter-
ests in the Bonaparte Gulf, located at
the top of the border between Western
Australia and the Northern Territory.
This area is geologically attractive and
many professionals have high hopes that
drilling here will yield a major success.
Another reason why AOD appeals is
because of the unusually strong overseas
support it is now receiving. A lot of
recent buying of AOD shares has
apparently stemmed from London and
it is generally thought that this is
because the company’s new mystery
partner in the Bonaparte Gulf project
is no less than British Petroleum. If
this does turn out to be the case and
it is made public, it can reasonably be
assumed that even more overseas sup-
port will be received and the shares
could be pushed even higher. As usual
in these cases, I bought the cheapest
shares available reckoning they were
the most likely to show the best profits.
In this case it was a $O.lO paid ex-
options which I got for 35 cents.
Another interesting company in the
oil business, which does not carry too
much of a speculative tag, is H. C.
Sleigh. The company now has quite a
bit of market appeal because of its
strategic position in the oil/gas/
petroleum industry and its price is
reacting accordingly. At the beginning
of the year the stock was $0.67 it
is now $0.89 and it has been up as
high as $0.95. Last year it earned 13
percent on capital and paid a 10 per-
cent dividend. This year it looks as
though it will do considerably better.
Apart from its traditional activities,
which are the ones that earn the profits,
the company is also right in the middle
of today’s action area the oil mar-
ket. It has a 10 percent shareholding in
Amalgamated Petroleum (of which Mr.
Sleigh is on the Board), 10 percent
interest in the Associated Group, and
500,000 shares in Timor Oil. As well as
all this, the company is also doing a bit
of prospecting on its own account. At
89 cents the shares look a good buy.
However, rather than buying the shares
I bought the convertible notes for $1.15.
The other day a stockbroker friend
pointed out a rather intriguing situa-
tion in a market I don’t normally worry
with, the preference share market. He
pointed out that Anthony Horderns’
$2, 1\ percent cumulative preference
shares are now 3J years in arrears with
dividends, and in June they will be four
years behind. This means that the
shares are, in fact, cum a 30 percent
dividend. At $1.50 the shares are
extremely interesting because it now
looks as though the company could at
long last be getting to the stage where
it will be making enough profits to
catch up on what it owes in dividends.
If (and this is the catch word) it does,
and is able to make a clean breast of
its 30 percent arrears within the next
year, anyone buying at today’s price
will be sitting pretty. They will not only
get an immediate return of $0.60 on
their investment but they will also be
able to look forward to a future divi-
dend yield at the rate of nearly 17
percent (15 cents a year on a price of
$0.90).

How our tips are going
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
WHEN THE year began, The Bulletin
(like everyone else) picked a selection
of stocks for 1968. Since then, most of
them (in the mining section, which
predominated the list) have done
remarkably well. This does not suggest
any special brilliance on our part; it
would be hard to pick losers this year.
But the key feature of our list is that
it excluded completely the highly
speculative low-price oil and mineral
stocks.
As a result, it presented very little
downside risk and it has brought some
remarkable rises. But probably the most
important thing about the list was that
it is still a pretty good one; most of the
stocks still have appeal even though
the bulk of the short-term gains they
stood to get have now taken place.
In minerals and oils, the stocks we
recommended were BHP, RTZ, WMC,
Mt. Isa Mines, Ampol Petroleum, AAO,
and Woodside. A buyer of this list
would have made a lot of money by
now; more, it can be admitted, than
we expected. At the time that list came
out, BHP was at less than $l5 (now
more than $23), RTZ was $lO (now
almost $l6), WMC was equal to about
$5 (now $12.50), Mt. Isa was $4.50
(now well over $8), and Ampol Petro-
leum was 87 cents (now more than
$1.40).
AAO has remained steady and
Woodside has gone up from $1.40 to
$1.95, which is fair enough except in
the context of massive rises from other
oil stocks.
At the time we also suggested some
industrials, and these still stand as a
reasonable sort of investment in an
economy that is moving ahead at a
faster clip (and which has now appar-
ently had good enough rains to clear
up most of the drought problems).
They were Containers, Woolworths,
Wynyard Holdings, Steamships Trad-
ing, Williams Adams (still very good
buying), Electronic Industries (up from
83 cents to $1.20 on the Philips offer),
Universal Textiles, and L. J. Hooker
(which should be another to benefit
from the end of the drought), and
some cheap “specs” such as Concrete
Industries, ODE, Bliss-Welded, Latec,
Jaywoth, George Hudson, and Feder-
ated Industries.
CHARTING has become a most im-
portant influence in the market. In a
sense, the charts help prove their own
predictions, as there are many investors
at present in the market who are fol-
lowing the technical situation shown in
the charts of share prices. They accen-
tuate upswings and deepen downswings
in a sort of herd instinct. But not
exactly; there are differences between
chartists, however, in that they each
have their own special method of de-
termining exactly what their charts
mean, and what sort of price targets
are suggested.
But how successful are Chartists in a
market like the present one? The Bul-
letin’s Chartist has done pretty well
this year particularly in a situation
where the charts are prepared several
days before publication so that the most
lively stocks often have to be excluded
to avoid irritating readers who might
see massive price changes before
publication.
Here is a list of our Chartist’s recom-
mendations in the last four months
remembering that some of last year’s-
predictions are still coming good as
well. Most of the targets set by the
Chartist in this list still stand; those
that change dramatically will be either
self evident or will be pointed out in
The Bulletin. The key thing about this
list is that the Chartist has been right
a lot more than wrong (and that none
of the few mistakes have Been serious).
Anyone who followed this advice in
1968 would now be well ahead. Never-
theless, it does seem useful to combine
the good features of charting with some
knowledge of the stocks themselves
rather than rely entirely on the tech-
nical patterns. Good chartists don’t
care what is happening to the company
itself as long as the pattern of share
prices is right; they consider that all
information about a stock is repre-
sented in its market price.

THE THREE stocks mentioned here
last week as being the subject of take-
over rumors certainly showed some
response. Big Sister confirmed our sug-
gestions that someone was looking at it
by announcing it was conducting
negotiations with another company with
a view to merging.
In any event, it is clear that the
merged company will remain on the
lists, since the offer being made through
Melbourne brokers J. B. Were and
The Chartist says:
CONSOLIDATED GOLDFIELDS has not been a spectacular stock since listing in
1566 but it now shows promise of excellent long-term potential. The price move-
ments during the current week have broken the resistance level formed at $7.40
and a short-term move to about $B.OO could be expected. However, the overall move
for the longer term could be to approximately $14.50. Last sale price on 16/5/68 —
$7.30.

Son to acquire any available shares at
$3.75 cash is aimed at those share-
holders who do not wish to retain their
holdings in the merged company. The
market clearly thinks the new grouping
will be worth more than that—or else
that a higher bid may be made for the
company. For it is pricing the shares
up at $3.90 (after reaching as high as
$4.30), above the J. B. Were “base-
ment” price. This seems a reasonable
thing to do, for there is very little
downside risk at this price (15 cents)
with the hope that either another
bidder may be attracted, or else that
the “backdoor entry” method being
used in this merger by Reckitt and
Colman will make the shares much
more interesting yet.
Meanwhile, Unilever, which was dis-
missed here last week as a likely bidder
for Big Sister, still seems to be up to
something. Strong talk that the
perennial Petersville takeover rumor
would eventually come off and that
Unilever was the buyer were scotched
in London by a Unilever spokesman
and by Petersville which announced
that “such an offer has not been
received, nor have any negotiations
been entered into and the company
knows of no likely approach.” But
Unilever’s name is still being men-
tioned around the place in a take-
over context, even for such curious
prospects as Mr. Whippy.
The other two takeover rumors re-
tailed here last week have not resulted
in any action yet —except in the market
place. Australian Development shares,
were around the $2.50 mark, jumped
well over the $3 mark, and suggestions
are very strong that something is brew-
ing, with Peko still favored. In addi-
tion it has the attraction of being a
gold stock at a time when speculation
on the future of the gold price is once
again giving goldminers a market
“run,” Drug Houses moved up nine
cents on the strength of the Washington
Soul chatter. But whether this is a
likely story or not is another matter.
THE WIDESPREAD RAIN should
make things a lot better for the fast-
growing Australian fertiliser industry.
Any company even remotely associated
with pastoral and agricultural activities
has had a thin time of it in Australia
in the past three years, with a drought
which, in two separate bursts, rolled
over most of the eastern States into
even the most favored areas.
As a result, Continental Oil’s hasten-
ing slowly on fertiliser manufacture
has been understandable. This means
that shareholders of Amalgamated
Chemicals (the public has a 27 percent
interest since Continental bought the
majority interest after a fight with Dow
in 1966) are still waiting expectantly
for fulfilment of Continental’s promise
that Amalgamated would be offered a
substantial equity in a fertiliser com-
pany.
Amalgamated’s annual results are
due any tick of the clock, which would
be an appropriate time for an
announcement, and the shares, in expec-
tation of good news one way or another,
kicked up to 60c last week, though
finishing at 56c.
Shareholders, who were accustomed
to getting a 12| percent dividend, got
only 5 percent last year (from a 5.3
percent earning rate) and no interim
was paid in respect of the first half of
the year to December, 1967.
The appointment of Mr. J. G.
Schroder as managing director of
Amalgamated, where he was formerly
vice-president of Continental in Aus-
tralia, and before that general manager
of Australian Fertilizers, is also being
interpreted as significant, pointing to
some action on the fertiliser field.
Even if Amalgamated’s 1967 results
turn out to have been as unencouraging
as the interim report of continuing
cost increases, the recent rain puts an
entirely different complexion on 1968
prospects. The agricultural chemicals
and pesticides must come in for greater
demand after drought-breaking rains.
THE NEED to provide funds for its
massive Gove bauxite project is prob-
ably the main reason why Alusuisse,
the world’s sixth biggest aluminium
producer (345,000 tons of aluminium
produced last year, 5-2 percent of non-
Communist production), has unex-
pectedly produced a real consolidated
balance sheet. The chairman explained
that this was necessary in order to
show bankers and other providers of
capital that Alusuisse has the sound
financial position needed to embark on
its expansion plans.
In 1967 the group had a turnover of
£l5O million. Its interests are spread
all over the Western world, producing
aluminium wherever there is cheap
enough power in the United States,
Norway, Iceland, Italy, and Western
Germany, though the company has
recently been foiled in its attempt to
build a smelter in Great Britain.
Alusuisse is expanding into more
general engineering and plastics (if
necessary through partnerships) to
strengthen its competitive position.
The key to the balance sheet is that
net cash flow of £2l million and new
capital of £7 million easily covered
investment of £2O million in new plant
and equipment and a £4 million
increase in working capital. Alusuisse’s
efficiency was such that it earned 10
percent on the capital it employs,
whereas the four big American alu-
minium companies get slightly less.
The only difference is that American
companies distribute a greater per-
centage of their earnings while Alu-
suisse, like nearly all Swiss companies,
tries to finance investment entirely by
its own resources and thus pays out
only a minimal dividend, though it
has been increased this year by over
a tenth.
The key to Alusuisse’s future (and
indeed to its financial honesty this
year) is the very large investment it is
making in Northern Australia. Together
with Australian minority partners
Alusuisse is investing more than $3OO
million in developing the immense
bauxite reserves at Gove near the
sea, but far from civilisation. Produc-
tion from this, by far the largest single
foreign investment ever to be made by
a Swiss firm, should eventually amount
to 1 million long tons.

general economic prospect, about which
the most respected prophets seem to

dictory advice on the economic course
from two leading Melburnians in the
past week or so. For one, Professor R.
F. Henderson told a CEDA gathering
that domestic demand was heading so
much higher and fixed investment
picking up so nicely (albeit not quite
as strongly) that the rising inflation-
ary pressures will need dampening by
higher taxes in the spring. No sooner
said than, speaking in the Supply Bill
debate, Mr. Frank Crean, the shadow
treasurer from Melbourne Ports, pro-
claimed a recession to be on the way
and any increase in taxation would
make it much worse than it threatened
to be.
No wonder the market prefers, in
its present buoyant mood, a position
of benevolent neutrality in its attitudes
to economic influences, as neutral in-
deed to its thoughts about possible
interest-rate changes after the passive
role these have been playing in share
buying and, for that matter, in the
financial and economic direction gener-
ally for so long. Who bothers these days
to consult or even keep an ear cocked
for the Reserve Bank oracle. Nobody,
not even Professor Henderson, whose
new Economic Review seemed to for-
get that interest rates might have some
bearing on the economic exercise. He,
like the market and nearly everybody
else, appears to have accepted the new
order in credit management • “Let
’er rip” which Dr. Coombs and
those who will succeed him next
month (he’s been overseas for some
time, so presumably they are in com-
mand already) have caught from the
economic philosophies and practice of
the Federal Treasurer, William
McMahon.
If the market is the slightest bit
worried or even interested in whether
credit is likely to be restricted (oh,
what a lovely record rise in trading-
bank advances last month!) or interest
rates increased, I haven’t noticed it.
At this time, everybody is apparently
getting as much credit as he wants (a
slight exaggeration perhaps) on the
idea that all cracks (especially those
caused by the drought) in income sur-
faces should be papered over. Sooner
or later it will be of interest to a very
large number of people, of course,
especially to those and there appear
to be quite a few of them carrying
high-priced mining shares on credit.
(We know of one lady whose broker
ruefully discovered she was carrying a
lot of Great Boulders bought at sl4 a
piece not even on that!)
True, the Stock Exchange has a per-
fect excuse in all its promising minerals
chickens (though some, indeed a lot of
them, will never come down to roost),
and in the wads of London money chas-
ing them for its present mood of very
careless rapture. Why should it spare
a thought for those awful days in 1966
when credit was as tight as a drum
and, at least in so far as industrials were
concerned, it was virtually officially
being forbidden to discount a future
economic prospect. This may prove to
have been a darn sight better policy in
retrospect than the one now being en-
couraged by a liberal-credit policy and
a neutral-interest-rate policy (keeping
interest rates well out of line with
almost all other countries). The present
policy is helping to write “boom” into
share prices and also into the prices
of Stock Exchange seats (Melbourne’s
newest Member, Michael Faulkner, had
to cough up $19,000 for the seat he
bought last week, which is an advance
of $2500 on the previous sale).
It Should be concerned, or at least
rather cautious, as suggested here last
week about whether that London money
will go on and on chasing the mining
chickens, but not as worried as Euro-
pean central bankers and the IMF to
whom Britain still owes billions (about
three) of dollars overall. The bankers,
but not the IMF, of course, could be
chasing Australian mining shares on
their own account, but on the face of
it it looks quite incongruous that such
a flood of private capital should be
flowing out of Britain when the British
Government or, more technically per-
haps, the Bank of England is weighed
down with international debts. For those
in the market scouting the possibilities
of a stop to the flow of money into it
from London this might be something
to ponder. Last week the British
Government announced a plan by
which its $U.5.1400 million outstanding
drawings from the IMF would be paid
off in small instalments stretching long
into the future, and all the central
bankers have been able to do in the
direction of getting their credit back
thus far is to renew them.
It is conceivable that if the IMF
and the European central bankers
haven’t yet woken up to the fact that
Britain is using a lot of the money it
owes them in this way (which seems
unlikely) or are simply winking an eye
to it in the hope that it will eventually
turn out for their own advantage as
well as Britain’s, the possibility is there
that the day could come when they,
rather than Roy Jenkins, the British
Chancellor of the Exchequer, decides
whether the outflow is going to con-
tinue or not. It seems quite inept to
imagine that in its present balance of
payments impasse Britain has a surplus
of capital available to invest anywhere
except in its own country. In the roll-up
it certainly has none to invest across
international frontiers on any realistic
international accounting. Nor will it
have until its balance-of-payments posi-
tion improves to the point where its
heavy net international indebtedness on
capital account can be cleared. The
present flow of money into London
from this market derives from an un-
tenable premise. It is not Britain’s at
all but other people’s. That doesn’t
make it the less real an influence on
share prices here, but it makes its
indefinite continuance the more highly
suspect.

Alcan adds ideas to aluminium...
and Avon proves we can make
a foil laminated carton that more
than matches overseas standards
Somebody once said, "the only place to go for really
good foil laminate is overseas". The story caught on and
companies wanting good quality, drew their supplies
from abroard. One of the companies was Avon.
Packing many of their cosmetics in foil laminated
cartons, Avon needed the highest quality possible. This
was to project the expensive "feel" of the product.
Although they purchased from overseas, they neverthe-
less continued to investigate the local market. One day
they read an Alcan advertisement. It said, "when it
comes to packaging in foil. Alcan can help". Avon
asked for details. They then asked for action.
Alcan adds ideas. To ensure, as far as possible, the
end result, Alcan suggested a round table conference
of all the people who would be involved. The meeting
was convened. Present were the printers, the board
suppliers, Avon's technical staff, purchasing people and
Alcan. First, it was agreed that quality standards could
be achieved. Secondly, it was decided to stage an
experimental run prior to launching into mass pro-
duction. On the day, all the members of the meeting
clustered around the laminating machine waiting for
the first piece to run off. When it did, critical eyes
examined it. It more than matched overseas standards
and Avon were happy to recommend Alcan foil to their
group of carton suppliers.
Perhaps Alcan can give your product a better package
deal. To find out all you have to do is ring Alcan's Foil
Division. They'll give you the whole story.

Security analysis
Sands, with best wishes...
MR. JOHN SANDS arrived in Sydney
at the age of 20 in 1837 and set up
shop in George Street on part of the
site of the present Myer’s/Farmer’s
store. Sands had served his apprentice-
ship as an engraver and map colorer in
his father’s printing firm of Robert
Sands and Son in London, a business
dating back to the early 18th century.
John Sands’ shop sold stationery, and a
printing and engraving business was
carried on beside. In 1847 a fire burnt
out the shop and Sands rented Mary
Reibey’s cottage in George Street in
1848, the site of the present Sands
retail business, which has since been
rebuilt on two occasions and is now
leased from the G.P.O. The Sands
family is still in business, although since
1950 the company, now known as John
Sands Holdings, has been publicly
listed. Mr. Grahame Sands, now aged
81 and the grandson of the founder,
retired as a director of the company
in 1967; his son, Dr. J. R. Sands, is the
company chairman, and his nephew,
R. A. Sands, general manager.
John Sands is today Australia’s
largest producer of greeting cards,
printed board games, and calendars, and
is also one of the largest commercial
job printers in the country. It would
appear probable that on a breakdown
of the company business, greeting cards
would represent about 35 percent,
printed board games about 15 percent,
general printing, including security-
cheque printing, about 25 percent, and
the balance is in a range of activities
including calendars and diaries and the
Sydney retail shop. The retail business
is kept on partly to advertise the com-
pany’s extensive range of printing
operations and most probably also for
reasons of sentiment connected with the
traditions built up over the past 131
years. Originally the printing depart-
ment was housed behind the retail
shop, but in 1903 the main printing
plant was shifted to Druitt Street, near
Sydney’s Town Hall. In 1960, a fac-
tory, since extended to 200,000 sq. ft.,
was opened on a 10-acre site at
Frenchs Forest, near Sydney, which
worked in tandem with the Druitt
Street premises, finishing off games and
cards which had been printed at the
Sydney plant. In September, 1968, the
Druitt Street plant will be phased out
and the printing complex shifted to
a new 270,000 sq. ft. plant and offices
set on a 5-acre site at Artarmon, which
will cost over $3 million. Branch sales
offices operate in all mainland States,
with Melbourne dating from 1937,
Brisbane from 1944, Adelaide from
1950, and Perth from 1954. In 1962
Alexander Bros., a medium-sized print-
ery, was acquired in Mentone, Mel-
bourne. Group employment exceeds
1250. The annual rate of growth in
company sales is in the order of 10
percent.
The British invented the picture post-
card (the forerunner to the greeting
cards of today) some time in the 18th
century. They are now Big Business.
The world’s largest company in greet-
ing cards is believed to be Hallmark
Cards Inc., of the U.S., but being a
private company its actual size is not
easily determined. The largest public
company in the U.S. industry is Ameri-
can Greetings Corporation, which in
1966 rang up sales of $U.5.77.5 million,
distributing to some 66,000 outlets, John
Sands, which started making Christmas
and New Year greeting cards in 1881,
is the Australian licensee of American
Greetings Corporation. In the industry
stakes, Sands is the front-runner, closely
followed by Specialty Press, which draws
on Hallmark for its inspiration, and by
Valentine Holdings, the licensee of
Norcross Inc., another big U.S. pro-
ducer. There are three other com-
petitors—Murfett Publishers, part of
National Consolidated; Regency Greet-
ings, now owned by Containers; and
Lonsdale and Bartholomew, which
belongs to Gordon and Gotch.
Greeting cards published in Australia
are mainly adaptations of U.S. and, to
a smaller extent, British designs. The
words which form the greetings may
have been prepared overseas or may
have originated in Australia. It is prob-
able that birthday cards, which have
many varieties —juvenile, age 1-10, 21st
birthday, relation (brother, sister, etc.),
comic, male, and floral designs—could
represent up to one-third of the total
industry output, while Christmas cards
could make up another 20 percent;
Mother’s Day, Easter Day, and Father’s
Day in that order add up to another
10 percent, and the balance consists of a
myriad of other cards in the format of
sympathy, baby, get well, engagement,
wedding, anniversary, invitation, accept-
ance, thank you, 21st keys, and cards
with an off-beat humor approach.
In the factory, greeting cards are
printed, then guillotined, folded, glitter
is applied, and an envelope inserted.
Glitter, collating, and packing are
handled by women. Much of this work
is done manually, because no machine
has yet proved itself more capable than
human hands. In the selling end of
the business, seasonal cards are sold
along the traditional lines of submitting
samples to buyers and obtaining orders.
However, most other cards are now
sold through a stock control system, in
which a greeting card company services
a vendor refill display unit on a con-
tinuous supply basis. Assistance is pro-
vided to stores in shop layout, design
fixture displays, and stock-control mer-
chandising. John Sands has about 100
salesmen on the road servicing about
5000 outlets throughout Australia, most
of whom are newsagents.
John Sands has been producing
printed board games since 1929, when
it brought out the game “Tripoley.”
There are now about 100 board games
in the Sands range. While there are a
number of perennial favorites such as
“Chinese Checkers,” “Snakes & Lad-
ders,” “Ludo,” and jig-saw puzzles,
which sell well each year, current TV
parlor games and other TV characters
provide the inspiration for many games.
The current best-seller in the games
field has been “Twister,” which sold
over 100,000 copies. With the exception
of “Scrabble,” which is not produced
by Sands, the company has almost the
complete market to itself. The company
has licences from Milton Bradley Co.,
U.S., in the top-quality end of the
market and also from Whitman Pub-
lishing Co., U.S., in the less-expensive
range. Up to 90 percent of games are
sold on a seasonal basis around
Christmastime.
Commencing in 1969, John Sands
will be printing the “Reader’s Digest,”
which has a monthly circulation of
620,000 copies, together with the other
publications of that group. This con-
tract has been formerly held by Wilke
& Co. Ltd., in Melbourne. In olden
days, the company carried out bank-
note printing, but as this work was
taken over by the Government, Sands
moved into security-cheque printing,
which they still do in considerable
quantities for the Bank of New South
Wales.

The interim announcement in March
reported sales and profits showing an
increase over the six months to Decem-
ber, 1967, compared with the corres-
ponding period in 1966. The Druitt
Street, Sydney, premises have been sold
on satisfactory terms, but it is
anticipated in the phasing-in period,
when manufacturing operations will be
shifted to Artarmon in September, that
there will be some diseconomies in
production which may temporarily
upset profitability. However, this will
not affect the current year’s earnings
to June 30.
At $3.25 the shares have a dividend
yield of 3.8 percent and the price
earnings multiple is 9.2. Shares are not
always easy to come by, as over 60
percent of the equity is locked away
by the Sands family, but they are
worth buying at current prices.


Behind the balance sheets
Detecting a good fat stock in
Bushells’ tealeaves
BUSHELLS LTD. is one of those old-
fashioned companies 'that would not
tell you the time of day; its reports
to its shareholders are masterpieces in
the art of giving the minimum statu-
tory information required by law. Yet
despite its apparent reluctance to
admit its role as a company in which
the public have an interest, it is an
interesting company. Its monumental
reticence cannot hide the fact that it
is doing pretty well; its refusal even
to discuss such questions as the state
of the world tea trade and the trend
of tea prices does not mean that the
stockmarket remains in complete
ignorance of them.
And there is no doubt that directors
have something to hide; not least being
the fact that its assets are being
massively underemployed. The con-
servatism of its financial reporting is
a fairly accurate reflection of the con-
servatism of its financial management.
But does this mean it is a bad invest-
ment? Not a bit of it; Bushells is a
good stock that seems to be doing very
well indeed and may do a lot better.
By the way the market is acting,
putting the shares up 45c in the last
three or four weeks, good news is
expected for the 1968 results to March
31 due out about the end of June.
The shares, though not frequently
traded, are now equal to the top
prices paid in 1966, but still short of
the 1965 peak. The current yield of
3.2 percent on income and 6.6 percent
on earnings is attractive for such a
well-heeled company, where there is
so much scope for income or capital
benefits, even though the only wind-
fall the shareholders have had so far
was the one-for-four bonus in March,
1964, and a reluctant-looking 2 per-
cent dividend increment last year.
The company was sitting on nearly
$600,000 worth of cash and bank
balances in March, 1967, and
$2,870,000 in short-term deposits,
which prompted no explanation for
this exceedingly flush position beyond
the statement that the new Melbourne
factory at Notting Hill was expected
to cost sl.7m. Even if this were paid
immediately, after the final dividend
of nearly $300,000, there would have
been $870,000 to spare.
Asked why the company preferred
to collect cash rather than borrow,
the chairman of Bushells, Sir John
Cadwallader, said the company must
be cautious, as the guidelines for bank
lending could be tough. Said he: “It
was wise to collect the money six or
12 months in advance, and even
though the company may have the
money around for a time, Bushells
could find a home for it some day.”
This may have been a hint of fresh
expansionary plans, but in any event
there is obviously plenty of fat in the
company, and it will be a long time
before this is trimmed.
Many companies would envy such
extraordinary liquidity (there are no
long-term liabilities, either), but more
dynamic ones could question why a
company should have over $3.4 million
in liquid funds earning less than six
percent, when shareholders’ funds
altogether can earn 9.9 percent, even
including all this money surplus to the
current operations.
Deposits rose from just over $J mil-
lion in 1963 to $600,000 in 1965,
$1.4 million in 1966, and $2.87 million
in 1967, and the interest received in
1967 rose from $41,000 to $185,000.
So far this year, the company has
relaxed its security enough to admit
that trading for the first half of the
current year to September resulted in
sales and profits being “substantially
the same” as the previous correspond-
ing period. In keeping with its con-
ventional reticence, there were no
figures released and no forecasts for
the remainder of the financial year.
But since then big things have hap-
pened to the tea business. Ceylon,
which supplies nearly 60 percent of
Australian tea, and India, the next big-
gest supplier (followed by Indonesia),
both devalued their currencies, but im-
posed export duties to maintain their
export earnings and largely negate the
devaluation benefits to tea-importing
countries. But Australian tea merchants
concede that tea prices have been
slightly lower as a result of sterling
devaluation, in which currency tea is
largely traded.
Quality tea is currently quoted on
London markets at from 4/6 to 8/11
a pound, compared with 4/10 to 6/11
(pre-devaluation sterling) a pound a
year ago. The top price quoted is up
29 percent (more than outweighing the
currency devaluation of 14 percent),
but the lower-priced teas are down
about 18 percent.
Bushells’ business is predominantly
tea, but the proportion it bears to the
instant coffee business which Bushells
began only in 1959-60 is not even
hinted at, as this food line is so com-
petitive. Nestles have a large share
of the instant coffee market; it is
doubtful if Bushells’ coffee represents
much more than 40 percent of its total
business. (The apparent consumption
of tea is by weight over 2| times that
of coffee in Australia, but coffee beans
are roughly twice as expensive as tea
and instant coffee perhaps four times
as expensive.) The company would
only admit that tea sales exceed those
of coffee, and that coffee has become
an important segment of its business
over the past nine years.
Its rapid growth is evident from
the fact that Bushells’ instant coffee
plant was expanded at a cost of $1
million in 1966, even though it was
designed for large production and
flexibility of product. Bushells also
has been making instant coffee only
since April, 1963, but the company’s
tea business has been established for
very many years.
Bushells is internationally known as
the largest tea distributor in Australia,
and as over 90 percent of Australian
tea consumption is in “proprietary
packets” selling around 70c a pound,
Bushells enjoys a very large share of
this business, supporting the contention
that Australia and New Zealand sell
the best value in tea.
The New Zealand devaluation of
25 percent could adversely affect
Bushells’ group results by about 4 per-
cent, assuming the same rate of profit-
ability and penetration in N.Z. markets
as in Australia.
In 1963 the Tea Council of Austra-
lia was formed to promote increased
consumption of tea in “this country,
with representatives of Indian and Cey-
lon Governments, and of Australian tea
packers and importers. The consump-
tion per capita of tea and coffee shows
a shift toward coffee (young people
and migrants are greater coffee drink-
ers) with 1961-62 figures being 5.81 b.
a head for tea, 2.01 b. of coffee, in 1964-
65 a steady 5.81 b. of tea but 2.41 b. of
coffee, in 1965-66 down to 5.61 b. of
tea and 2.21 b. of coffee.
Bushells was wise to move into
coffee (it probably provided most of
the growth in the last seven years’ re-
sults), and no doubt the first slice of
Nestles’ business was the easiest to get.
It could be harder from now on.
Nestles have half-heartedly tried to get
into the tea business with instant
“Nestea,” but this is imported and of
no significance.
There may be implications for Aus-
tralia in the interesting moves afoot
in Britain with Schweppes’ takeover of
the Typhoo Tea Company, which is a
leading tea merchant, but nowhere near
as big as Bushells’ associate Brooke
Bond (which has held 20 percent
interest in Bushells dating from June,
1958). Bushells view this as a valuable
association, for the two combine buy-
ing operations and exchange informa-
tion. Feeling in the trade is that
Schweppes may expand Typhoo’s tea
trade in Australia.
As for the coffee market, Australian
Government tariff policy requires Aus-
tralian processors to buy at least 30
percent of total requirements from
Papua and New Guinea, (free of duty)
to qualify for the full duty rebate on
other coffee. Of coffee imports to
Australia, 34 percent came from Papua
and New Guinea, source of the milder

coffees, so some processors buy more
than the minimum percentage. All that
Bushells is prepared to say is that it
qualifies for the rebate. A greater
amount of Australian supplies comes
from Uganda, with Brazil supplying
half as much as Uganda. Coffee from
these two countries is noted for its
‘“'body,” the thickness of the liquor.
Coffee prices are largely determined
by the International Coffee Agreement,
dominated by Brazil, the largest pro-
ducer, and America, which buys almost
half the world’s exportable coffee. The
agreement is designed to stabilise
coffee prices by regulating supplies of
raw coffee under an export quota sys-
tem which is reviewed each September.
Bushells’ Sydney tea factory, for
blending and packing, is in Carrington
Street, City, but tea storage is at Con-
cord beside the coffee plant. The Flin-
ders Street, Melbourne, factory site will
be sold when the Notting Hill tea
plant is finished about July-August of
this year. The company has a post-war
tea factory in Brisbane and one in
Fremantle, dating back to 1929. It has
a sales organisation only in South Aus-
tralia.
Capital expenditure is rarely divulged
in Bushells’ accounts, and the figures
given at balance date for capital com-
mitments unprovided for in the
accounts are not always a reliable
guide as to the expenditure for the
following year. Extensions to the Con-
cord factory and a new warehouse and
office in Adelaide were major items of
expenditure in 1965-66. Some invest-
ment allowance has been available in
recent years for capital expenditure on
plant, but much of the expenditure
has been on buildings, which affords
no tax relief.
The tax provided in the past five
years has been consistently higher than
theoretical tax (adjusted for minority
interests), giving further strength to the
theory of directors’ conservatism.
Adding back minority interest, depre-
ciation, and tax, it can be seen that
1967 results represented a decided
improvement on prior years, forcing
an upward revision of the dividend
from 10 to 12 percent. Perhaps no
further improvement could be expec-
ted in dividend this year, but there
should be in future years, unless direc-
tors give shareholders good reason why
they should retain such huge cash
resources.

Mining
The task in hand
for Silver Valley
IN THESE hectic days it is quite clear
'that a large part of turnover on the
mining board is coming from tech-
nicians—-those who start buying in
quantity whenever they discern a firm-
ing trend in the shares of companies
which have any prospects at all of find-
ing economic minerals. In so doing
they are sometimes disappointed. But
quite frequently events that they
have, in fact, been riding on the coat-
tails of others who have been rather
better informed. This chain of events
can commonly mean that, when an
announcement is made of drilling re-
sults, the market has already moved
the shares in question up to a level
which almost, if not completely, takes
account of the possible benefits of the
find. So it is encouraging to have the
occasional announcement which im-
proves on reading instead of becoming
a piece of yesterday’s news. After all,
that is what this boom is all about, and
considering the amounts of money and
energy being spent on turning up new
mineral deposits it must be only the
diehard pessimists who do not rate
highly the chance of more and more
good finds.
At all events, the technicians who
speculated on the recent market
strength of Silver Valley Minerals NL
got more than they were probably ex-
pecting. In The Bulletin of February
2, 1968, it was pointed out that on
drilling results at that time, the com-
pany was looking at a very rich but
thin vein of silver ore. Even allow-
ing for the considerable ore dilution
involved in mining a vein of ore only
inches thick, the company’s prospects
then appeared reasonable, as there
would not have to be a great deal of
ore to establish a payable mine. In
the mining of an orebody the size of
the Kambalda nickel deposit, or any
other fairly large deposition of mineral,
the degree of ore dilution is not very
critical—mining can be carried out
from drives as small as two feet wide
by four feet high.
But the extraction of ore from veins
as small as 12in. (such as the earlier
strike by Silver Valley) inevitably in-
volves the extraction of a lot more
non-mineralised rock perhaps as
much again as the actual vein of ore.
And the capital costs of sinking a
shaft, and driving tunnels and so on,
form a much larger proportion of total
costs when the ore vein is very small
than when it is large enough to be
measured in feet rather than inches.
The company’s latest intersection
certainly resolves any dou'bts on this
score. It intersected a sheer zone of
20ft. of mineralisation. This measure-
ment is not a vertical dimension
or a horizontal thickness, but is the

length of mineralisation encountered by
the drill which is drilled at an angle
from the vertical perhaps 60deg.
At such an angle an intersection
of 20ft. would indicate that the zone
of mineralisation is about 9ft. wide
at the place where the drill hole passed
through, and the drill intersection
covered a vertical distance of about
18ft.
Over the 20ft. of intersection the
drill encountered 3ft. 9in. assaying
7840 z. of silver per ton, 12in. assaying
4840 z. per ton, 4ft. Bin. assaying 78oz.
per ton, and 4ft. assaying lOoz. per
ton. These are very good values
indeed, and the size of the intersection
means that there is every indication of
a workable deposit of ore between the
293 ft. to 313 ft. level. The company is
going ahead with further drilling to
establish how deep and how long the
mineralised zone extends.
In terms of dollars, and using the
whole of the ore zone, including the
lower-grade lOoz. section, the metal
content of the ore encountered in this
drill hole is worth almost $6OO per
ton of ore. This compares very hand-
somely with around $7O per ton for
the ore which Western Mining has
established over in the West; another
way of putting it is that it is the
same as getting 17oz. of gold per ton
(at SA3S), whereas most gold-miners
would be more than happy with 17
pennyweights.
The rich Juno mine of Peko-
Wallsend Limited has reserves of
slightly less than 3oz. of gold per ton,
i.e., worth $135 per ton of ore. As
pointed out in an earlier issue, the
outcrop of the orebody at Silver
Valley’s Ruby prospect measured over
1000 ft. on the surface and the fissure
varied in width from Bin. to 4ft. 6in.
Should Silver Valley be successful in
locating extensions either laterally or
at depth it would certainly have
largely justified the value being placed
on the company at the present by the
sharemarket, without making any
allowance for the developments which
could occur on the company’s coal
deposits at Mawson, near Newcastle.
These deposits contain both steam-
ing and coking coal, the latter being
the source of main interest due to the
growing demand from Japan for cok-
ing coal. The location of the deposits
is perhaps their main asset, as they
are situated right on the coast and
their development for an export mar-
ket would not rely on the construction
of a railway. This fact would surely
be a big attraction to the Japanese, who
are already getting a lot of their coal
from deposits well inland, and who
have had to put up with the risk of
delays due to overloading of rail
facilities.
The company’s major tasks are the
proving of reserves and quality of the
deposits, and then negotiation of a
market.
THE INTRODUCTION of tax
amendments aimed a't reducing the
concessions currently enjoyed by min-
ing companies and their shareholders,
on Thursday last week, appears to
create a particular anomaly in respect
of uranium.
A year ago the Minister for
National Development brought down
restrictions on the export of this
mineral for the very good reason that
Australian reserves were inadequate in
the light of future possible demand.
The current amendment which will
end the exemption from tax enjoyed
by uranium miners will yield no addl-
tional revenue, as there are no uranium
mines being operated. On the other
hand, it does nothing to encourage the
search for additional deposits of this
mineral. The deduction currently
allowed to shareholders for capital
moneys subscribed to prospecting corn-
panies excludes uranium and gold as
the income from mining these two
metals has been exempt from tax.

HARNESSED
WATER WASTED?
...even the water which has been diverted
and put to work is often wasted
In this wide, sunburnt land, water is
our most precious and limited resource.
Most of our surface water flows to
waste into the sea.
This is bad enough, but we even waste,
in agriculture, water which has been
diverted and put to work for us.
This is not all. We waste the full poten-
tial of the soil itself, plus the invest-
ment in rural utilities—roads, railways
and services.
A new awareness of this problem is
forging bright prospects for the future.
Critical men are looking at their land.
Is it producing to its full potential or
merely working at ‘half-pressure’?
A growing conviction of the possibility
of unused capacity and missed yield
potential heralds the start of a great
leap forward in productivity. Sur-
prisingly enough, this conviction springs
from what has been, until now, a little-
known fact of plant nutrition.
This fact is called ‘The Law of the
Minimum’ and states: “The growth of
plants is limited by the most deficient
plant nutrient element present in the
soil, all others being present in ade-
quate amounts.”
In other words, even a bountiful supply
of water is wasted if one of the vital
soil elements is in short supply—the
plant will only progress to the maxi-
mum ‘ceiling’ set by the most deficient
element.
In this context, plant nutrients may
well be more limiting than water. In
these cases water is surely wasted and
its full value as a vital element is not
realised.
If the balance of soil nutrients is cor-
rected by supplementing those in short
FERTILIZERS:
KEY TO FARM
PROSPERITY
supply, full advantage is taken of all
nutrient elements—yields are dramati-
cally increased. All resources in the
chain—water, labour, capital investment
and public utilities—are then used to
full advantage and dormant potential is
realised without any appreciable in-
crease in costs.
This process of correction is best under-
taken by the application of chemical
fertilizers containing the nutrient ele-
ments vital to plant growth. The most
important of these are nitrogen, phos-
phorus, potassium and sulphur, because
these are required in large amounts.
Secondary and trace elements, notably
calcium, magnesium, molybdenum, zinc,
boron are also necessary.
Today, Greenleaf is manufacturing fer-
tilizers containing these elements in the
varying proportions required for the
balanced nutrition of our crops and
pastures.

THE LAND
Shaking out the wheat harvest
EVEN WITH the good prospect of a
record wheat harvest of more than 500
million bushels rising before them, this
could be a winter of discontent for the
growers, who face the possibility that
the Government’s desire to write more
economic sense into wheat stabilisation
will gain the day when the Australian
Agricultural Council considers the
renewal of the present scheme for the
ensuing five-year period after June 30
this year.
Blessed as they’ve been this autumn
by timely rains, growers have sown
exuberantly in the face of fears of some
notable agricultural economists and
others advising them to go easy on their
acreages in a drive to restore their
fortunes after last year’s indifferent
harvest.
Behind the urge to grow more wheat
is the industry’s historical expectation
that this year, as usual, operations on
the scale of the individual grower’s
choice will be underwritten by a
totality of cosy featherbed arrange-
ments leaving him merely to lie back
and wait for the assured arrival of his
cheque.
No industry in Australia is better
organised or looked after. Thanks to
the enlightened overseas selling cam-
paigns and successful searches for new
overseas markets by the Australian
Wheat Board, it has long been spared
the nightmare of big undisposable sur-
pluses and only once every five years
does it have to worry about pains from
its soft supporting under-belly of
Government patronage.
As the day for decision on what shape
the stabilisation arrangements will take
in the next five years draws near,
activity in the industry’s organisational
bodies is almost frantic. The Govern-
ment has put the present order under
threat in proposals which are believed
to include scrapping or at least
drastically changing the cost-of-pro-
duction formula under which the home-
consumption price is determined under
the existing plan, so as to leave fixing
the price virtually in the Government’s
hands. More definitely, the Government
wants not only to widen the gap between
guaranteed home consumption and
export prices but also to reduce the
maximum quantity of wheat on which
the price would be guaranteed, all this
to be achieved by a variation in the
way the guaranteed prices applied in
the past five years. The Government
proposal sets the guaranteed export
price at 145 cents per bushel for 175
million bushels and 170 cents for 60
million bushels guaranteed for home
consumption, whereas last year’s overall
guarantee price covering both export
and home consumption was 165 cents a
bushel (this applied to 150 million
bushels for export; home consumption
last year was around 60 million bushels).
Apparently the Australian Wheat-
growers’ Federation ordered panic
stations on hearing of these proposals
and have formulated a set of their own,
which will be put to the Department of
Primary Industry and later this month,
together with the Government ones, will
be explained throughout Australia by
AWF executives. What irked the AWF
most was the idea of scrapping the cost-
of-production formula, though it has
conceded that such changes could be
appropriate “to meet present-day stan-
dards.”
So far as their guaranteed level of
returns from exports and home con-
sumption goes, wheatgrowers would
appear to lose under the Government’s
proposals compared with last year, but
precisely how much is a moot point
because the level of home consumption
is an unknown in the comparison.
Assuming it is steady at 60 million tons,
the loss could run into several millions.
The wheatgrowers may complain that
the guaranteed or basic element of
their incomes is being reduced, but on
the other hand at least in the coming
year they could gain more on the
swings of export sales of the huge sur-
pluses expected to be available over the
175 million bushels for which they’ve
been guaranteed 145 cents a bushel
than they lose on the guaranteed
roundabouts.
It is entirely understandable that
growers should desire to keep to the
present cost of production formula for
adjusting the home-consumption price
to periodic cost movements (they got
9 cents a bushel from it last year). It
has worked decidedly in their favor
over the years, especially with the spread-
ing of overhead costs over bigger outputs
in most recent times. But it is high time
some hard economics was injected into
the whole matter of determining how far
wheatgrowers (most of them couple it
with other farming lines) should be sub-
sidised for the local consumption of
their product whose price enters so
strongly into the cost of living and is
highly sensitive to arbitrary adjustments
made from the present untenable for-
mula for determining wheatgrowers’
costs. The best way to do this is to
make a fresh start and scrap the for-
mula altogether.

Profitable defences for the beef herds
OUR BEEF ROADS program has
progressed well. Only catch is that the
amount of beef being trundled along
them is not increasing at a very im-
pressive rate. Lack of fencing on the
runs is one of the chief causes of the
restricted turn-off. Until the proper-
ties are adequately fenced the beef
industry in the north will remain a
primitive enterprise for hunters rather
than husbandmen. For several reasons,
beef fences should attract Government
attention as much as beef roads. Indeed,
it is a toss-up whether the fences or the
roads ought be built first. Historically,
roads have invariably followed devel-
opment. Lately, however, for reasons
that are not altogether obvious, the
pattern has been reversed. This seems to
be the situation now in both the city
and the country. Thus, we get beef
roads before we have produced the
beef, and streets are laid out in new
suburban subdivisions before the
houses are built. The overriding im-
portance of disease control should
weight the dice in favor of fences. If,
say, foot and mouth entered the north
it would become endemic. Suppression
would then have to await the construc-
tion of fences. Inevitably, the disease
would sally southward time and again
from its fastnesses in the unfenced
north.
Apart from this argument, which
concerns us all, fencing could quickly
generate high profits and cut costs on
many of the large beef properties. When
the Federal Arbitration Court’s ruling
comes into effect this December requir-
ing Aborigines to be paid at least the
basic wage, pastoralists will strive to
reduce the number of working hands.
Fences put stockriders at a discount.
Progress is usually bought by the sacri-
fices of some people. While labor-sav-
ing by this means could be consider-
able it would be small compared to
the gains accruing from several of the
other advantages of fencing. Moreover,

some of these would begin to appear
as cash within a year or two of the
fences being erected.
Control over mating would result in
greatly increasing the cow-and-calf
survival rate. Segregation at weaning
would save many more animals. Regu-
lation of the grazing would lead to the
sale of steers a year earlier in many
areas. These gains would have a snow-
ball effect: earlier disposal of steers
would allow more breeding cows to
be carried, and so on. The value of
the other advantages might be deferred
for some years and might not be ac-
curately assessable, but they could be
just as important.
Thus the achievement of greater
efficiency in reproduction would leave
latitude for culling and ultimately the
whole herd would be upgraded as a
beef-producing machine. Again, with
the grazing under control by fencing,
pasture establishment could be pushed
along faster, feed conserved, and
erosion and pasture deterioration re-
tarded. On the debit side more watering
points would have to be installed.
Mr. E. F. Board, a Western Aus-
tralian cattleman, has had a stab at
estimating the effects of fencing on
a typical beef property in the Kimber-
leys, where to this day fences are few.
The most striking feature of his figures
is their magnitude: mortalities are
staggering. In the first place, under
the present system only half the calves
dropped survive to branding. Then
nearly half of all the calves that are
branded disappear and three-quarters
of the branded female calves perish.
Clearly, there is great scope for re-
ducing these percentages and even
small reductions at each point of wast-
age would produce a relatively great
increase in the turn-off. If, for instance,
fencing lifted the branding rate from
40 to 50 percent and permitted the
steers to be sold as three-year-olds in-
stead of at age four as at present, the
cost o-f the fencing would be wiped
out in two years. Gross return in the
third year would be 30 percent higher
than for the last year before fencing.
Mr. Board based his calculations on
a property of 650 square miles and
running 20 head to the square mile.
He assumed $5O to be the average
value of the stock sold; and it should
be noted that the price of cattle has
been rising steadily. His fencing plan
cal’ed for nothing elaborate. It merely
cut the property into three “paddocks”
in such a way that further subdivision
could be made later with relatively
short lengths of fence.
He put the cost of fencing at $5OO
a mile supplied and erected. This could
be a gross exaggeration. With modern
suspension fencing the cost could be
nearly halved. In the Queensland beef
country this type of fence is beginning
to catch on. Materials have been quoted
at from $l7O to $2OO a mile and
labor at $6O to $7O. As they are much
less intricate to build than conven-
tional fences it might be possible to
employ displaced Aboriginal stockmen
in their construction. Suspension fences
simply consist of three or four strands
of barbed wire strung on steel posts
driven into the ground at intervals
of about 100 ft. instead of the tra-
ditional heavy wooden posts dug in at
about 15ft. spacings.
The principle was recognised at least
60 years ago and it is something of a
mystery as to why graziers have been
so loath to adopt this type of fence.
Possibly in the absence of experimental
findings and field-station tests they
lacked sufficient confidence in them.
Agricultural engineering is the Cin-
derella of rural science in this country.
The bias is most unfortunate and un-
reasonable because machines and con-
structions together comprise the second-
or third-greatest input cost on most
farms. Melbourne University is the only
one in Australia with an agricultural
engineering faculty and even it is
minuscule. However it may be sig-
nificant that the only experimental work
done on suspension fences, other than
in America, has been conducted at
Hamilton, Victoria the State least in
need of fences.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Alf Garnett: fact or fiction?
JOHN HEILPERN talks to JOHNNY SPEIGHT
IN THE past few weeks, Enoch Powell
and several hundred dockers have
proved something that everyone was
supposed to know but nobody wanted
to admit: Alf Garnett, the know-all
embodiment of every conceivable form
of bigotry and ignorance, actually exists.
Until the other day, we could afford
to be generous about Garnett, even
about ourselves. There was, it was said,
a little of Alf Garnett in everyone. So
he was made into a folk-hero, which
was a cosy thing to do, like retiring a
dangerous politician to the House of
Lords. But if people are now astonished
at the racial hatred that’s spreading
through Britain, it’s because the folk-
hero has taken shape and his creator
taken on the role of a prophet.
“I didn’t basically create Garnett,”
says Johnny Speight, the East End
docker’s son who wrote “Till Death Us
Do Part.” “He was already there. He
was created by a vile society. I wrote
this thing knowing Garnett is true of
people in this country. If the show
were on the air now, he’d be agreeing
with every word Powell said. I meet
Garnetts in my local pub in Northwood,
and although they talk in a posh accent,
a lot of them aren’t much brighter than
Garnett. All Enoch Powell has done is
prove my point: the country’s full of
Alf Garnetts. But I never wrote to
•change them. I was pointing out that
this character existed. I wanted people
to laugh at him. If they can’t laugh it’s
not my fault.”
Speight is 47, talks with a stammer,
and enjoys life. He usually lies in the
bath for two hours a day, then covers
himself with eau-de-cologne: “I once
worked with a bloke who had myxo-
matosis,” he explains.
He’s a surprising man: one expected
him to be young, perhaps because
most entertainers who’ve recently had
a sudden impact on the public seem
scarcely out of school, but in fact he
didn’t start writing till he was 32.
“For some reason,” he says, “I thought
I’d be a writer. I don’t know why. I
had no reason to think I could be.”
In fact, Speight was encouraged to
write when he first read George Ber-
nard Shaw in a public library in Can-
ning Town, and it’s Shaw who has in-
fluenced his life ever since. “There
was always some comment of his I kept
reading in the papers. I really thought
he was a comedian, like Tommy
Trinder. I thought I must catch his
act some time. Then I was in this
library trying to find a book to read
when I saw volumes and volumes of
Shaw. I thought, Christ! he writes as
well. So I read his novel ‘lmmaturity,’
read it right through, and I was
knocked out. There was someone say-
ing things I’d felt for years. After that
I devoured every book he’d written
and every name he’d ever dropped.”
Speaking about himself (after a
few drinks), Speight described him-
self to me as, “An egotist, a moralist,
a very shy man or a very anti-social
one, and a nasty bastard at times.”
Speight now lives with his wife and
their three small children in the stock-
Johnny Speight
broker belt of Northwood, in Middle-
sex, drives a Bentley Continental (which
stays in the garage most of the time
since the breathalyser), and earns about
£30,000 a year. But before Northwood
came 34 years living with his parents
in Canning Town, until he eventually
wrote the joke, “They pulled down
my old house and built a slum,” and
got a job writing gags for Edmundo
Ros, the bandleader.
“I was,” he admits, “what is known
as a layabout.” Before World War 11,
Speight preferred not to work if he
could help it, and went through 30
factory jobs, systematically working his
way up one side of the road and down
the other. “If it hadn’t been for the
war,” he says, “I’d still be in Can-
ning Town. It was all I knew. The
war made me think a bit, which I
hadn’t seen any need to do before.
What would have been the point?”
After the war, Speight took up the
drums and scraped a living playing jazz
for seven years ; until the day he came
across Shaw and impulsively sold his
drum kit for a typewriter. He joined
the Communist Party, and left, dis-
illusioned, for the Labour Party (of
which he’s still an active member),
churning out Socialist plays which the
Unity Theatre regularly returned.
Speight is now one of the few comedy
scriptwriters whose name is as well
known as the show he writes; but if
“Till Death Us Do Part” was a sud-
den success, he had long since estab-
lished himself among the country’s
highest-paid gag writers. He wrote all
the Arthur Haynes scripts 1 — 500 shows
in nine years and in Haynes’ bully-
ing, clever-dick tramp there was clearly
an embryo Alf Garnett.
The difference is that Speight found
Garnett in the factories of Canning
Town, in the Army, and in the Soccer
crowds, but Haynes’ tramp was dis-
covered in the back of his car. Speight,
in a vintage Bentley, had given a
tramp a lift. “I prefer Bentleys,” said
the tramp. “A little Anglia offered
me a lift a while ago, but I wouldn’t
take it. I mean, you meet a better
class of person in a Bentley.”
The BBC gave its blessing to “Till
Death Us Do Part,” almost in spite of
itself. Tom Sloan, the Head of Light
Entertainment, had his doubts, and his
deputy, at that time Frank Muir,
thought the first script in bad taste
and didn’t think it would make a series;
but Speight had clearly proved his
talent as a scriptwriter and had already
won a Screen Writers’ Guild award for
a strange, rather Pinteresque play
called “The Playmates.” When I asked
Speight how intent he was on becom-
ing a serious writer, he replied, “I am
a serious writer.”
He’s also implacable: no man will
ever convince him there’s anything
offensive about the word “coon,” the
word Garnett uses about blacks. The
essential point for Speight is that the
word is used in real life not neces-
sarily only by racialists, and there’s
no sense in pretending it doesn’t exist.
It was over the last show in the series
that Speight suddenly split with the
BBC, publicly accusing them of “savage
censorship.” It’s now very unlikely
that the BBC will bring back Garnett
or that Speight would want to write
another “Till Death” series. But
whether that’s a good thing in the
present political climate largely depends
on how many people actually support
Garnett. Dennis Main Wilson, the pro-
ducer of “Till Death Us Do Part” from
the beginning, who has been with the
BBC for over 20 years, says: “The idea
was to hold Garnett up to public ridi-
cule, but in point of fact a lot of people
laughed with him. There was some-
thing about the occasional mail one
received and the way the studio
audience laughed at certain lines. It’s
likely that a large proportion of the
20 million people who watched the
show did so for the wrong reasons.”


Music
Perfect unity
By KENNETH ROBINS
WHAT A SHAME it is that the econ-
omics of concert-giving force music
designed for intimate performance into
halls which are much too large. No
such problem, however, marred the
concert by the Borodin Quartet in the
Peninsula Playhouse at Avalon.
The idea of giving out-of-town runs
to visiting groups is wholly admirable,
particularly in the area of Sydney’s
northern beaches, for attendance at a
concert on the south side means an
exceedingly long haul for music-lovers
which must take the gilt off the even-
ing. With the majority of the audience
spared the thought of a major odyssey
after the concert, the spirit of involve-
ment, which I carried on about in these
columns last week, was present in full
measure at Avalon.
The major work on the program was
Beethoven’s Opus 95, that lonely
quartet, the harbinger of the so-called
Third Period and sub-titled quartetto
serioso by Beethoven himself. This
quartet is pretty stern stuff; there is
more than a touch of that uncompro-
mising dare we say, brutal — ; element
that is found in the Great Fugue. The
fluctuating moods of jagged tension and
uneasy calm were handled immaculately
by the players, the fugal section in the
slow movement was a perfect example of
logical integration and the dark scherzo
had a ferocious bite, which was palpable.
Most commentators regard the final
allegro section in the last movement as
a tragic outburst, but for me it is a
burst of sunshine and I felt the Borodins
agreed; the tensions, admittedly un-
resolved, of the rest of the quartet are
dismissed or rather set aside, for Bee-
thoven was to take up these matters
later.
Excepting the three vastly intriguing
experimental pieces by Stravinsky,
which came after the interval, the
concert was one of escalating musical
values. The Borodins opened with,
you’ve guessed it, the Second Quartet
of Borodin, but it was some little time
before one realised that they were play-
ing their tune. In fact it was not until
the second movement when the players
entered upon selections from “Kismet”
that they really got into their stride.
By this time they had adapted them-
selves to the acoustics of the full hall
and had dehydrated the rather heavy
atmosphere. This piece is an open invi-
tation to sentimentality which the
players declined. The leader, Rostivlav
Dubinski, played ravishingly, but his
tone is never cloying, and although I
suspect his love for this work is a little
faded the result was thoroughly en-
trancing. The second fiddler, Jaroslav
Alexandrov, is a master of the difficult
art of knowing when to match and when
to complement his leader. This, in fact,
was true of all the players; obviously
individuals musically, they have devel-
oped an uncanny sense of ensemble.
The second work on the program
was the Fourth Shostakovich, and from
the opening bars everyone in the hall
must have been conscious of the players’
dedication. Shostakovich’s quartets have
avoided the traces of banality which, at
times, creep into his work, and per-
formances, like the Borodin’s must
establish his claim as one of the signifi-
cant composers of this century, despite
the current fashion to regard him as a
member of the arriere garde, as if this
necessarily makes him of little account.
But, after all, J. S. Bach was associated
with such a group, a circumstance for
which we can be eternally grateful. The
performance was not only authoritative,
it was a miracle of ensemble. Among the
memorable aspects, even on the
technical side, were the remarkably per-
cussive sounds the cellist achieved at the
nut of the bow and his rock-sure intona-
tion even in celestial regions up among
the resin.
However, to single out any member
of this group seems wrong, and this is
underlined by their practice of having
each player in turn lead his colleagues
on for curtain calls. The string quartet
is the most perfect instrumental com-
bination in music and with the Boro-
dins it also becomes an incarnation of
civilisation.
Theatre
Exploring
that myth
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Burke’s Company. Bill Reed. Russell
Street, Melbourne.
UNDER A PULSING sun of welded,
riveted, glaring metal plates, the stage
slopes deeply toward the audience,
giving a feeling of distance and disori-
entation. Looming above us, figures are
miming the final agonies of Burke, Wills,
and King, who are dying with every
step they take. Their movements, bal-
letic and hypnotic, are sustained by
Peter Sculthorpe’s desolating music
until, one by one, they fall.
The antipodean myth has always
seemed to me just so much pressure-
cooked Australiana. I cannot take a
Colin Roderick seriously when he
claims to hear the haunting rattle of
convict chains in the writing of Patrick
White. And the paintings of Nolan,
Tucker, Boyd, and the rest seem
spurious comic-strips, without real rele-
vance to our urban culture. Yet this
play of Reed’s presents an aspect of the
myth with such impact that it over-
whelmed my reservations, including
those I sometimes feel for the future of
the theatrical medium itself.
In 1860 Burke led his party out of
Melbourne determined to be the first
Helmut Bakaitis, George Whaley, and
Sean Scully in “Burke’s Company”
man to cross Australia from south to
north. He succeeded, but his safe re-
turn was dependent on two men,
Brahe and Wright, each of whom was
left in charge of a depot with men,
supplies, camels, and horses.
Brahe was told by Burke to wait
three months at Cooper’s Creek and
to expect later reinforcement by
Wright. But Wright didn’t arrive, and
after four months there was still no
sign of Burke. Brahe was agonised by
both his responsibility and the land-
scape. (“The land got bigger and I
got smaller,” he said.) Trying to believe
that Burke and the others had some-
how got safely back to civilisation, and
with a man in his party dying of scurvy,
Brahe finally left for home.
Ironically, it was just nine hours
later that Burke, Wills, and King
arrived, weak from malnutrition. Ulti-
mately Burke and Wills died, only
young King surviving to be rescued
by a party of which the guilt-ridden
Brahe was a member. Reed makes
Brahe and his conscience central to the
action, death of the explorers taking
place as a nightmare in his mind.
Ogilvie has made the entire produc-
tion an exercise in disciplined mime
and stylisation, and when Reed’s words
capture the obsessive rhythm of end-
less marching or the delirium ol
approaching death, the effect is unfor-
gettable.
However, some of Reed’s writing is
bluntly naturalistic and fights against
Ogilvie’s style, as when the long
debate between Brahe the common
man and Wright the cynic damages
the mood that Ogilvie and his cast had
built so carefully. But even with this
flaw, which could be corrected by some
rewriting, the play is an important
one, and the production is the best I’ve
seen on an Australian stage.
Bewilderingly the play has been
damned with faint praise by the critics
of Melbourne’s daily Press, when against
all reason they’ll find something cheer-


ing to say about the most banal
comedy or worthless musical. Their
carping and inadequate response is
typified by this paragraph: “George
Ogilvie’s production about one and
three-quarter hours without an interval
—had the echoes of ‘Royal Hunt of the
Sun’ without the colorful drama of that
dramatic success. Here in the feature-
less outback . . . the result is to make
rather heavy demands on the audience.”
So Reed is blamed for the fact that
Australia’s hinterland is populated by
Aborigines instead of Incas! And since
when did serious theatre apologise for
making demands of its audience?
I see in the program that the com-
pany intends to tour their french-
polished production of the wormy
antique “The Magistrate.” The Trust
would be better advised to scrap that
plan and tour this production.
Shaw on Shaw
By DENIS O'BRIEN
Max Adrian as G.B.S. Independent
Theatre, Sydney.
IT TAKES a lively ego, as well as
artistry, for an actor to give a one-man
show. Max Adrian satisfies both require-
ments, but doesn’t quite spin the magic
it takes to put an audience totally out
of mind that one man on a large stage
leaves a lot of unfilled space. It is a
paradox that Mr. Adrian’s ingenuity
ultimately devaluates his artistry. He
has elected to indulge George Bernard
Shaw by allowing him to talk about
himself and not merely to give readings
of G.B.S. plays and pieces. As a result
we get an interesting and imaginative
version of Shaw on Shaw, but in the
process an inadequate and strangely
subjective one.
Little of the man’s well-known crusti-
ness comes across; too much senti-
mentality creeps in; not enough con-
flicts are probed. We all have blind-
spots about ourselves, but it is difficult,
sitting in the theatre observing this
resurrection, to believe that Shaw ever
saw himself colored so rosily. Toward
the end it is the enactment more than
the subject that is holding the attention
and some of us are becoming aware of
the length of the performance.
Mr. Adrian holds his characterisation
superbly through three ages of Shaw’s
life—the self-discovery of his late
’thirties, the prolificity of his middle-
age, the wandering reminiscences in the
years before his death at 93. With
make-up and mannerisms Adrian makes
his Shaw a physical reality. The per-
formance sometimes veers toward
capering self-indulgence, but sufficient
of it is disciplined to make the evening
a qualified success.
Max Adrian first performed the pro-
gram at the 1966 Edinburgh Festival
and now will tour it throughout Aus-
tralia.

HOME NETWORKS
THANKS to America’s CBS and Eng-
land’s ICI, we’ll soon have EVR. And
it is likely that this new technique will
have a more profound effect on tele-
vision viewing than the introduction ol
color. EVR is Electronic Video Re-
cording, a process combining charac-
teristics of narrow-gauge film, kinescop-
ing, and videotape, which produces a
long-playing record with pictures.
Developed by the same CBS team
that invented the LP, EVR is about
to be test-marketed in England. The
sound is recorded on a magnetic strip,
while the picture is coded on to film
stock by electronic beams. Replayed
through a $300 attachment for the
home TV set, the result is half an
hour or more of high-quality sound and
image.
CBS plan to test-market the device
with educational albums; one being
planned is a guitar course by Pete
Seeger. But EVR clearly has the
potential to free the TV viewer from
the tyranny of networks. It will be
possible to buy—or borrow from a
library—one’s favorite Bergman or
Fellini feature, or to screen oneself a
series of orchestral concerts or operas.
The minority-interest viewer who cur-
rently feels ignored by admass will, in
short, be able to choose his own view-
ing just as easily as he currently selects
books or records.
Unlike videotape, EVR will not allow
people to “pirate” television programs
off air, which already is proving a
problem with the mass-production of
low-cost recorders. On the other hand,
it poses a clear threat to the networks’
ratings. For this reason there has been
anxiety among American television
executives about the development, and
dissension in the ranks at CBS.
TALKING HEADS
AUSTRALIAN politicians are not very
successful at communicating effectively
through the public speech. Nationwide
TV coverage of recent State visits has
emphasised the windy rhetoric which
often passes for speechmaking by our
leaders on important political occasions.
The problem always seems to be—what
to say? The cynical answer is that our
politicians meet the problem by talking
a lot and saying nothing, which isn’t
quite fair.
When Haile Selassie was in Canberra
last week, Prime Minister Gorton ap-
parently spoke off the cuff but, as on
most occasions, this was rather decep-
tive: in his breast pocket was a speech
i he’d written out and memorised im-
mediately beforehand. He had probably'
prepared his speech from a draft sup-
plied by someone in his department.
Keith Sinclair, former editor of the
Melbourne “Age” who now works in
the PM’s Department, often has a hand
in Prime Ministerial draft speeches.
Mr. Gorton has a happy knack of
making his speeches sound better than
they read, which is often pretty bad.
Take this sample from the transcript:
“There is something about the land of
Ethiopia which I think all Australians,
indeed all people of British descent, my
own father included, knew about, had
heard more about, not in detail but in
general, the land of Ethiopia than of
any other land in Africa or indeed
most other lands in the world.”
Mr. Whitlam’s speeches are much
more elegant, if occasionally bordering
on the ridiculous — “The idea of the
exotic enigma of Ethiopia (alliteration
is a favorite Whitlamism) was sown by
the great seminal poets of our Judeao-
Graeco-Roman civilisation ...” A good
idea, if a little far-fetched, was to
develop an analogy between the Prester
John myth of a south land — Ethiopia
— and us: “Today in this room these
two great legends merge and appear
in their essential truth . . . one of the
oldest Christian nations in the world
. . . the oldest ‘free’ nation in Africa
. . . great leadership . . . first African
head of State to come here . . . great
powers betrayed Ethiopia in the
’thirties . . . Australia proud to have
played a role in liberation . . .”
Mr. Whitlam has no speech-writing
bureaucracy working for him. Press
secretary Freudenberg and research
officer Matthews knock out a draft,
which is typed up.
COMEDY, DRAMA
IMMINENT professional revivals of
Sandy Wilson’s “The Boy Friend” and
a brace of Noel Coward plays have
thrown the Australian amateur theatre
movement into a bit of a flap. Sydney’s
Phillip Productions intend to stage the
plays this year, forcing Samuel French,
the play publishers, to withdraw
amateur performing rights. It was dis-
covered that half a dozen amateur
revivals of Coward were in various
stages of preparation around Austra-
lia, and at least eight productions of
“The Boy Friend.” Happy compromises
have been reached in some of the con-
flicts, but one of the supporters of Too-
woomba’s amateur group wrote, under
the pseudonym “Hopping Mad,” to his
local newspaper indignantly threatening
to write to Noel Coward about “the
chaos this practice could cause.” The
thought of Mr. Coward in his Bermuda
retreat receiving a letter from “Hop-
ping Mad,” of Toowoomba, must be
worth some revue sketchwriter’s time.

THE FINAL PHASE of the Elizabethan Trust Opera
Company’s 1968 season opens in Sydney on June 11 at
Her Majesty’s Theatre. The company began its tour of
the eastern States with performances at the Adelaide
Festival of Arts in March, then moved on to Melbourne
and Canberra and opened in Brisbane this week.
Included in the repertoire is the first Australian pro-
duction of “Don Carlos.” Sung in Italian, this opera by
Verdi deals with the intrigues of Spain’s 16th-century
royal court during the time of the Armada and is based
on Friedrich Schiller’s play of the same name. Rosemary
Gordon will share the role of the tragic queen Elisabeth
with Italian soprano Antonietta Stella. Neil Warren-
Smith is cast as Phillip 11, Reginald Byers plays Don
Carlos, with Lauris Elms as Princess Eboli. The costumes
are by Sydney designer Desmond Digby; sets by New
Zealander Raymond Boyce. The whole is directed by
producer John Young. Other operas being performed
this season are “Tosca,” by Giacomo Puccini, “The
Magic Flute,” by Wolfgang Mozart, “Tannhauser,” by
Wagner, and Puccini’s “The Girl of the Golden West.”

Art
Reveries that
are relevant
By ELWYN LYNN
Janet Dawson. Gallery A, Sydney.
Ti Parks. Watters Gallery, Sydney.
Shay Decking and Suzanne Goldberg.
Rudy Komon, Sydney.
William Ferguson. Barry Stern’s, Syd-
ney.
PAINTING that comments on painting
is now a mild epidemic among the
avant-garde; to Dick Watkins and
Rollin Schlicht, who use pure and
commercial abstract designs of the
’twenties as decoys, are added Janet
Dawson and Ti Parks, who choose, in
general, rather banal, ready-made
forms, as though art as the search for
significant form was a hoary myth.
Art lurks in the common place: rain-
bows, highways, rising suns, broken
ladders, and kitchen floors. It’s a mode
that upsets the notion of painting as
■complete in itself and free of external
associations and allusions.
It’s a painting that is allowing the
imagination more sway; there’s a
•curious notion abroad that clear, cool
•color and exact delineation indicate
a superior cerebral and intellectual ap-
proach, and that there’s something
irrationally sloppy and self-indulgent in,
for example, abstract expressionism.
Baudelaire, whose attitudes were the
occasion of an international critical con-
ference in January in Paris, saw matters
differently; he championed the play of
the imagination, saw nothing wrong in
paintings that induced relevant reveries,
considered Ingres’ clear color and
classic line as a formula at work, and
regarded as preferable the romantic
turbulence of Delacroix, whose intellec-
tual interests were wide indeed.
Janet Dawson’s fine work is distin-
guished by the Baudelairian play of
imagination amid her flat forms and
.sourish color: below the white teeth
of the Opera House cutting a black sky
is attached a suitably dismal grey trap-
ezium for the sea; in Wall the severe
lines that divide the grey square change
■direction to give the flat surface an
illusory three-dimensionality, and then
the subtly inflected grey begins to float
like a cloud. The same play of solidity
and insubstantiality occurs in From the
T errace where four windows, like
prisms catching abstracted forms, seem
to swing into the wall and into the
room; it has some of her earlier elusive
lyricism here seen more emphatically
In Door with its dislocated, overlapping,
fluid rhythms, and Heeny’s Rose where

the central black rose and the black
stripes push the top of the canvas into a
shape a little out of square as though
emotion was only just boxed in.
The tougher ones, like Highway 31,
that is shaped like an orange slippery-
dip, the lOft.-long Rainbow with its
scallops, pyramids, and curves out of the
geometrical decor of the ’twenties, and
Up and Away, are not so successful.
Up and Away comments on Batman’s
world with harsh, scalloped orange
forms hurtling into the sky, and Weather
at a Glance, with two versions of the
sun’s movement, comments both on
Lichtenstein’s ben-day dot sunsets and
Monet’s renditions of the same scene.
Miss Dawson is among our best ab-
stractionists when she is less arch and
more intuitive; she is vastly more edgy
and has more verve than Ti Parks, of
Melbourne, who has intriguingly
followed Mondrian’s abstraction where
it came to rest in the suburban kitchen
and lounge. What intrigues him is how
human beings destroy the austerity of
vinyl squares and oblong panels; so he
puts an oblong of black fur amid
painted oblongs, places rectangles of
green and pink acrylic fur above a black
barbed-wire design on green, frames a
pink knitted area in what resembles a
dark blue kitchen floor, and supplies
Black Rail with its own towel rail.
However much you square up the world,
nature (nylon thread sprouts as water
in Girl in the Rain, and a large area of
grass grows wilfully below precise shapes
in Ess Five) and man will disrupt it;
even the back of an actual chair disturbs
the severe, dourly colored shapes around
it. Parks is best when he balances funk
and geometry; his purely formal works
are dull, and the purely funky, like the
five crinkled hairnets on regularly
crinkled dirty-ochre paper, are depress-
ingly nasty. His Broken Ladder of flat
slats against a cloudy, crimson void lets
the imagination play as freely as it can
with Miss Dawson.
Both are indebted to cubism as is
Shay Docking, who has developed into
an expressive cubist during her sojourn
in New Zealand. Her more formidable
works are now so compact and em-
phatic that they emanate an air of
menace; her Nikau Palms, surrounded
by a granite surface and beneath a
cracking sky, have the awesome remote-
ness of Judith Wright’s “Cycads,” and
even the pinks in the more-relaxed
Medallioned Night begin to look as
bruised by the impactive forces as the
confused purples. If these are power-
fully claustrophobic works, those of her
fellow New Zealander Suzanne Gold-
berg are dashingly loose and best when
she is freest and more Nolanesque.
William Ferguson, another Mel-
burnian, turns to Aboriginal legends
and symbols to make a generally rich,
intuitive heraldry that rarely forgets its
primitive origins. His technical prowess,
which is considerable, is kept under con-

Clever Man’s Stone is a simple,'roman-

Films
Boredom
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Doctor Faustus. Directors, Richard Bur-
ton and Nevill Coghill.
A COUPLE of years ago Richard Bur-
ton joined the Oxford University
Dramatic Society in a stage production
of Marlowe’s “Doctor Faustus,” with
Elizabeth Taylor appearing as Helen of
Troy. Apparently everyone concerned
was so entranced with the result that
it was decided to put it on film. This
was a grave mistake. Very likely it
was great fun for the participants, but
for movie audiences it’s a great,
amateurish bore.
Certainly Burton sounds impressive
intoning Marlowe’s lines, but it’s a
recitation rather than a characterisation.
In Coghill’s adaptation of the play and
in Burton’s performance there’s nothing
to explain why Faustus enters into the
pact with the devil to begin with, or
why he condemns himself to everlasting
damnation for such trivial rewards. (He
entertains a royal court with some magic
tricks and is able to take a spiteful
revenge on a sneering knight: these
diversions, and a perfunctory love scene
with Helen of Troy, seem to be all
he gets out of the bargain.)
Beauty has many faces, but according
to this film they’re all Elizabeth Tay-
lor’s. She appears in various diaphanous
costumes and assorted coats of metallic
paint, and is silent except for an unim-
pressive cackle of demoniac laughter
as Faustus is dragged down to hell. At
that she does better than the members
of the OUDS, who are almost without
exception simply awful.
The co-directors, finding themselves
in charge of a camera that can actually
show what Marlow is talking about,
present the film with naive enthusiasm
in a completely literal, unimaginative
manner. Thus if the text mentions
Orient pearls, gold coins, or a ride in
triumph through Persepolis, the camera
obligingly shows you a picture of just
that.


BOOKS
A warning to art collectors
By ELWYN LYNN
Van Meegeren, A Case History. Lord
Kilbracken. 197 pages, 39 plates.
Nelson. $6.60.
IN 1943 seven experts, two later to
be on the Coremans Commission in-
quiring into whether Van Meegeren
did fake all he had claimed to,
gathered to pronounce on a new Ver-
meer, The Washing of Christ’s Feet,
and the thirteenth of Van Meegeren’s
fourteen forgeries. It had been taken
to a dealer with the usual tale of a
great Dutch family that had fallen on
hard times and wanted to remain un-
known. Professor Van Gelder never
doubted its genuineness, but thought it
ugly; Dr. Hannema, Director of the
Boymans Museum, said, “None of us
liked it very much, but we were afraid
it would go to Germany.” Perhaps
they had heard a whisper that Goer-
ing had bought Christ and the Adult-
eress in 1942, but it would have been
a whisper they could not acknowledge,
because the Dutch Trading with the
Enemy Act, under which Van Mee-
geren was charged, cast a wide net.
Dr. Altena declared that it was a fake.
Despite all this and the fact that the
dealer refused to have it X-rayed, “The
preposterous ■ outcome was that those
seven great experts recommended that
it should be acquired for the Rijks
museum.” Why was Altena persuaded
against his opinion? There had been
doubts about the first Vermeer, Christ
at Emmaus, of 1937, when the French
expert Georges Isalo wrote: “Ce nest
pas un Vermeer! C’est un faux!” and
Duveen’s man in Paris cabled New
York: “Picture rotten fake.” Yet Lord
Kilbracken thinks that there is one
chance in a thousand that Vermeer
did paint the Emmaus, and Decoen,
whose book appeared in 1951 and who
has written various polemical articles,
thinks the Emmaus and The Last
Supper are genuine Vermeers.
How had Van Meegeren, who
declared the above two works fakes,
done it? Lord Kilbracken examines his
motives, which apparently began with
resentment of his neglect by critics
(though this is not proved; he was
praised by one critic and made off with
his wife), and then developed into a
love of money and a pseudo-
intellectual-cultured life. If Decoen is
right, what motives led Van Meegeren
to declare genuine Vermeers to be
fakes? Was he further confounding
the discredited experts or was he suf-
fering delusions of grandeur?
At the trial in 1947, Hogendijk, who
had handled five of the works, hardly
understood how he had been hood-
winked, but said that after the first
forgery subsequent ones were com-
pared with it rather than with all
Vermeer’s works, most of which are
not in Holland, and in Europe during
the war most were not readily avail-
able for examination. Then, after
1940, all forgeries were sold in secret
lest the Germans seize them. (Hitler
had taken Vermeer’s Artist in the
Studio from Vienna.) Ironically, it was
a work sold to Goering and found
in an Austrian salt-mine after the war
that led to Van Meegeren’s arrest.
Not noted by the witnesses was the
fact that Dutch dealers, who regard the
seventeenth century as a piece of real
estate, were agog "o find any expensive
old master.
The Commission found that the
Emmaus was a forgery, but Van Mee-
geren had skilfully baited the hook for
Bredius, called the Nestor of Dutch
historians; he had discovered Christ
with Martha (now in the National Gal-
lery at Edinburgh) in the shop window
of a London art dealer in 1901. It was
the only Vermeer on a religious subject
and Bredius, as did others, thought
there would be more, and similarly in-
fluenced by Caravaggio. Van Meegeren
had all these ingredients and borrowed
figures from other Vermeers. In 1928
Bredius had denounced as a forgery a
“Hals” certificated by a fellow expert.
His opinion was highly regarded; it was
an opinion that had infuriated Van
Meegeren, for the “Hals” had been
discovered (?) and retouched by a
friend of his. Bredius announced the
discovery of a remarkable Vermeer and
the Rembrandt Society bought it for
about $A500,000 at present values.
Lord Kilbracken is not much con-
cerned with stylistic analyses of the for-
geries, but the lacklustre Hollywood
faces, the slight zombie-like dreaminess
and flaccidity of the flesh, especially in
the face of Christ, are positively odd
compared with the bloom of health in
a Vermeer. Certainly Caravaggio’s
faces often look at others as though
they are not really seeing them but are
listening to off-stage voices; Van Mee-
geren’s hear and see nothing.
Kilbracken is mainly concerned with
refuting the case put by Jean Decoen;
the arguments are about the two Last
Kilbracken ...which Last'Supper?
Suppers and Decoen’s claim that the
“second” is a Vermeer and that Core-
mans after the inquiry had a fake Last
Supper painted and placed in Van Mee-
geren’s house in Nice, and after Van
Meegeren’s death had the Douwes Bro-
thers, who were dealers, find a photo-
graph of the Hondius canvas which
Van Meegeren used as a base for his
Last Supper, are too detailed to exam-
ine here. There seems to be no cause
without champion and no champion
who won’t invent a cause. Lord Kil-
bracken’s detailed account whets our
appetite, but offers no bibliography and
confines opinions too much to the pro-
tagonists of 1947. How he can still think
there is a chance that the Emmaus is
genuine, with the evidence of the altered
stretcher and the cut-down canvas,
eludes me. Maybe Decoen has a better
case than Lord Kilbracken indicates.
Van Meegeren proved that he was
no creative artist and, though skilled,
not a great forger. It is easy to trick
critics who deal in immediate, person
judgments, but connoisseurship is a dif-
ferent matter and depends on accum-
mulated opinions over a period; in the
end connoisseurship was vindicated.
Books on forgery always end happily;
there can’t be another Emmaus or Pilt-
down Man, yet Michael Kmit, on his


return from America, called in “Kmits”
that he claimed were not his. The
trouble is that he was alive; the late
Balson, Vassilieff, Miller, and de Maistre
would be safer choices, but let Van Mee-
geren be a warning to forgers and
buyers.
Forgery is a despicable practice be-
cause it defames the fine art it copies
and panders to the undiscriminating
acquisitiveness that it would like to
expose, except that the money is so
good.
There are, by the way, genuine Van
Meegerens; the Contemporary Art Soci-
ety, in its show Art Without Epoch, in
1951, showed one.
Next time the ice
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Ergo. Jakov Lind. Methuen. $2.50.
IN THIS BRILLIANT semi-political
novel Jakov Lind turns some of the
absurdities peculiar to humanity, par-
ticularly in its Austro-Germanic form,
into a jolly farce almost too possible
for genuine laughter. He has a way
of hurling truth like a series of custard-
pies into the incredulous faces of his
still-grinning readers the heavier the
filling the crazier the crust. He seems
to have learnt the hard way to live
with the Marx family, he can fool
with Groucho while ducking under
Karl’s arm.
The story (if that is the word) is
set in present - day Austria and
revolves around two elderly men, the
fanatical Wurz, self-sealed into his glass-
encased, hermetically closed, germfree
house on the hill, where even the
neighbor’s cat is suspected of packing
a pistol, and his opposite, his enemy
Wacholder, plotting against him with
poison-pen letters and “nerve-foam”
(which he will put into the water-
pipes when he has invented it) from his
filthy, vermin-riddled, derelict hulk on
the river bank below. In order that
sex should be given its rightful
prominence in all this, Wacholder is
further encumbered with a physical
abnormality, a phallic symbol par
excellence, with which he is once sup-
posed to have committed murder.
Even Lind’s most guileless phrase, his
easiest flowing chatter, packs a
walloping rebound: so Herr Wurz used
to work for the “gas company”; that
seems harmless enough; but after the
laugh comes the implication, what gas
and in what company . . . the address
is Auschwitz or Dachau. This is
gallows-humor at its deadliest. The
inference is clear when Wacholder
decides that if he gets enough people
to believe that Wurz does not exist he
will never have done so. And what is
more, any visitor abroad who has been
peered at by his hosts through a front-
door periscope after being asked to
identify himself by two-way radio before
the double-locked front gate was opened
by press-button remote control will not
even find Wurz’s fortress much exag-
gerated. If, at other times, the satire
seems unnecessarily obscure, this is
probably partly because one hesitates to
say too outspokenly that the manias
and phobias which are to be found
today in certain layers of European
society may be inverted post-war guilt
complexes as large as Lady Macbeth’s.
Lind makes no distinction between
one type of German and one type of
Austrian. (As the book was well received
in Germany and in his birthplace, he
knows there are other types.) Inside a
certain species of Austrian, he seems
to be saying, is another housepainter
waiting to be let out. The author is in
the best position to comment. He
escaped from Vienna to Holland at the
age of 11 and, unlike Anne Frank,
successfully hid there for the duration.
“A Better World” (“Eine Bessere
Welt”) was the original title when the
novel was published in German two
years ago, but apparently, lest we should
overlook the ironic overtones, the Eng-
lish version has been redubbed “Ergo,”
which I at first took for a jocular Latin
“therefore.” However, the blurb leads
us to believe that it derives from
ergotism, the mania caused by eating
diseased rye—ryebread is the staple diet
in these parts. In this case, although
not wishing to quibble overmuch at
such a good crack, shouldn’t the word
be “Ergot”?
At a time when the new National
Socialist Party was no more than a
risible smudge on the true-blue horizon,
Lind allows Wacholder to babble on:
“Do you know, honest to goodness,
there are times when freedom doesn’t
appeal to me at all. All this democracy
stuff is a hoax. This live-and-let-live
routine, it’s not for us. It’s foreign,
it’s alien. Sooner or later we’ll have to
get rid of it. We’re just too healthy
for that kind of thing. Sometimes I
have this daydream: I see icefields
with nothing growing on them, no
people, either. That soothes me. In
the last war we almost did it . . .”
This is one of the rare moments when
the author lets the grinning mask slip.
The excerpt is typical for what he has
to say but not for the manner in which
he says it. His style owes some debts
to both Gunter Grass and Samuel
Beckett with maybe a leering Joycean
ghost peering over one shoulder, but
they are debts, not loans. The end re-
sult is original, first-rate literature in
its own right. Lind is never bitter, he
never loses his aggressive cheerfulness,
and in this most unpoetic of subjects
there is always a poetic lilt to the prose,
which has been beautifully retained in
Ralph Manheim’s remarkable piece of
translation.
Today, this is the only way to tackle
a subject that was long ago squeezed
dry of sensation in ordinary words, in
all those endless statistics that flow past
our eyes without entering our minds,
those subhuman photographs, those
diaries by inmates who got away, those
awful predictions for the future. We
have learned to condition ourselves
against nightmares and bogymen, past
and present. Lind’s jumbled dialectics,
his medical, scientific, and philosophical
jargon run riot, his “plush culture and
mush vulture” at home, the sum total
of his irresistibly mad logic may cause
many to rethink the implications,
which are, of course, not merely Aus-
trian or German but universal. Which-
ever way one looks at “Ergo,” whether
as social comment or pure literature, it
is a pungent contribution to contem-
porary satire.
WHAT BECAME OF THE FAMILY?
That father, mother and son, trapped
in the lens
Of a spent, Edwardian day, had no
idea
They would be so dispossessed, or
end up here
Unwanted against a couch in the
auction-room.
Her starched white neck is still a
delicacy
Emerging with some candor, for her
day,
From the suggestions of a low-cut
blouse.
His hand upon her knee has an
owner’s air,
The twirled moustache its pride.
None separates;
Nothing can come between, is what
his style,
Her eagerness, imply. Not even the
son
Spun of their loving in the webfoot
dark
When, breasting tides of sleep, they
sank,
Moaning into the harboring dream,
and woke
Shaken and sure that something new
would come
From such incredulous intensity.
The boy sits by her at the end of the
seat;
Knows he is shared, but cannot inter-
rupt,
Frighten them into love or a new
arrangement
Centred upon himself, by a word of
warning
Of how he will die on a hill called
Vimy Ridge,
Still separate, and still so far to fall
Into this cast-off day. The death of
a house
Echoes under the hammer. A world
has gone
Like a dream, or a photograph of
no one
Known now at all. I can give them
no name;
Guess only their griefs and the terror
Of who hides under the hood of every
camera
Mocking with permanence what must
fade and fall
and end anonymous. It will not help
to ask
Why we are here? What happened to
that family?

THE LAST SUPPER
No stigma yet,
The bread, unbruised,
The wine unsoured,
The cockerel yet to crow,
He and we twelve
Together in the upper room.
Washed from our feet
By unpierced hands
So as to feel the weight
Of all men’s guilt;
Save me, save mine.
Offering me
His body and His blood,
Two thousand years
Of pity in His eyes,
He gently murmurs
“Kiss Me, Judas.”

Hennessy. Weidenfeld and Nicholson.

“I AM GROWING sicker every day of
this business of buying and selling
human beings for beasts of burden
. . . On the eighth day (out to sea) I
took my round of the half-deck, hold-
ing a camphor bag in my teeth; for the
stench was hideous. The sick and dying
were chained together. I saw pregnant
women give birth to babies whilst
chained to corpses which our drunken
overseers had not removed. The blacks
were literally jammed between decks as
if in a coffin; and a coffin that dreadful
hold became to nearly one half of our
cargo before we reached Bahia . . .”
This was the slave trade in 1812 as it
appeared to a United States citizen on
one of the hundreds of slave ships ply-
ing between the Guinea Coast and
Florida. James Pope-Hennessy does not
say in his history of the African slave
traders whether the voyage was a profit-
able one, but it promised to be so, the
captain having purchased 100 “prime
blacks, only 20 of them females” for a
few £lOO worth of Manchester cotton,
China beads, iron bars, rum, guns, and
laced waistcoats. Landed in America
or the West Indies, his cargo could
expect to recover better than £5OOO
on a market hungry for labor.
The most striking fact about the
slave trade as this 'book describes it is
its economic inevitability. Linking the
discovery of America with the com-
mencement of the African slave trade,
the author underlines the necessity in
the new colonies for cheap labor to
work the sugar plantations on which the
wealth of the West Indies was based.
White men could not and would not
endure the grinding work of the fields,
but Africans were sturdy, stupid, and
available. Merchantmen soon found that
a profitable business could be made of
working the so-called “Triangular
Trade”: buy slaves in Africa, sell them
in the West Indies, load up with sugar
and sell that in America, then take the
profits back to Africa to buy more
slaves.
Diversification of this kind allowed
the slavers to remain working long
after their trade had become an
economic anachronism. Not only did
the demand for slaves have to fall off;
sugar also had to fail and the social
situation in Africa, the Indies, and
America alter appreciably before
slavery could be completely destroyed.
As late as 1844, an official British
report could read, “We believe that
the slave trade is increasing, and that
it is conducted perhaps more system-
atically than it has ever been hitherto.”
Six years later the United States
officially outlawed slavery, as England
had done years before, and the trade
faltered and began to die, leaving be-
Slavery...an economic inevitability
hind four centuries of corruption, tor-
ture, and death.
For the light it casts on the political
and economic basis of slavery this book
is vital and fascinating reading, but
there is probably more drama in its
author’s stories of the slavers them-
selves, men from a dozen countries
involved in a trade which tested to the
limit their humanity as well as their
greed. The many quotes from journals
and letters illuminate some odd aspects
of the institution of slavery; brutality
on the part of slave masters contrasted
with the compassion of others who
found themselves caught in a com-
mercial system they could not evade
or alter. To us, detached today from
the realities of the period, it is impos-
sible to see the slave trade as it must
have appeared to these men, but the
extracts from their letters show that
the image of the trader as a whip-
wielding sadist is a far from accurate
one.
Most slavers looked on their work
as another form of import/export, not
materially different from commerce in
sugar or oil, and certainly the condi-
tions of their trade did not argue
against this view. The childlike Africans
could not have seemed much better
than animals to these cynical European
merchants, and the dumb impassivity
with which they submitted to confine-
ment, the branding iron, and the whip
no doubt encouraged the slavers to treat
their charges as salable animals.
What strikes one most about Pope-
Hennessy’s picture of slavery is its
mixture of violence and low comedy.
If he had wanted to paint a more
horrifying canvas, the author might
have left out references to the habit of
one slaver of mass-baptising his cargo
before sale, or the fact that the letters
“S.P.G.” branded on a slave meant he
was owned by the Society ifor the
Propagation of the Gospel.


Graham Kerr tells you:
How to make
spaghetti as
though you were
born to it.
Prepare your sauce with Clarified
Butter. It’s as simple as that. Clarified
Butter, which is pure dairy butter with
the water, salt and curd removed,
brings out the flavour of things in a
way nothing else can. And it’s a delight
to use —it doesn’t splutter or foam
when it’s melted, it won’t catch or burn.
And you use a lot less of it than other
cooking fats or oils. Food comes to
the table far less greasy. Now try this
spaghetti dish and be prepared for a
little disbelief on your family’s part.
SPAGHETTI MARINARA
1 lb. spaghetti
2 oz. clarified butter
1 clove garlic, crushed
4 tomatoes, peeled and chopped
1 tab. chopped parsley
1 /2 tspn. basil
1 1/2 tspns.'salt
1 /4 tspn. pepper
pinch oregano
12 oysters
8 prawns, shelled
8 scallops.
Cook spaghetti in large container of
boiling salted water until tender. Drain.
Melt clarified butter in large pan. Add
garlic, tomatoes, parsley, basil, salt and
pepper. Cook 5 mins. Add oregano,

NATURE'S FINEST
SOMETHING NEW WITH
Graham Kerr
THE ART OF BOILING
WATER-AND SPAGHETTI
FOR MANY years the Anglo-Saxon
races have enjoyed the delights of La
Cucina ltaliana, or, if you prefer, spag-
hetti on toast.
This quite remarkable repast, beaten
only by a Welsh Army Catering Corps
sergeant’s addiction to chip sandwiches,
has developed a taste for spaghetti
cooked al flacid.
I suppose that this should follow the
general disease of unconcern that has
marked English-style cookery since the
days when scones -were first incinerated
by royalty.
Vegetables, naturally green, are popu-
lar when grey, meats naturally red and
tender become dingy and tough, spag-
hetti naturally al dente is popular when
brutally murdered.
Inspect, if you will, a slice of toast
covered with spaghetti dripping in
tomato sauce. The once crisp toast is
wilting under the sopping attack. In
seconds it is a crisp-edged square of
scorched mush. But what of the spag-
hetti?
Each strand is carefully broken into
lengths not beyond the capability of a
short intake of breath —roughly three
inches. This dismal mini-strand lies
bleached white, as helpless and texture-
less as a jellyfish left behind by a
thankfully receding tide. Coating each
sodden inch is the brilliant, red tomato
sauce valiantly trying to hide the shame-
ful defeat of its comrade in arms.
Understandable that this supreme in-
sult to the Italian race should have
existed prior to World War 11, but
surely we can now accept her as an ally?
Spaghetti al flacid must be replaced
by al dente —to suit the tooth.
Let us concern ourselves first with
length. Is this of great concern?
Apparently the answer is yes. In Italy
I visited the largest spaghetti factory in
the world, and was advised that the
length should be at least one yard—
fully extended.
The machine that produces this fam-
ous pasta turns out a strand with a
bend in it. It measures 18in., but when
cooked just makes a handsome 36-2-in.
The main motivation for length would
seem to be shared between purchase
appeal and the desired illusion of the
dish containing one endless strand.
There are no other sensible advan-
tages, only disadvantages. To consume a
length between 3in. and 9in. is—to be
sure —very tricky, but it’s a picnic
compared with 3ft., especially if you
suffer either from shortage of breath
or a small mouth.
The marathon length also presents a
nightmare task to a waiter let alone
the hostess who feels socially obliged
to dish up while seated.
Should the king-size spaghetti be
coated in tomato sauce, then, out of
courtesy to your guests, you should
never hold a black-tie dinner.
I’m quite prepared to assert that the
best length should be a minimum of
12in. and a maximum of 36|in.
Whilst the length is an interesting
subject, the question of texture is vital.
Spaghetti must be slightly underdone,
and the merest speck of uncooked
starch should show white in the centre
of each cut strand.
The simple and classical test is to
bite a piece. There should be a slight
resistance, or, as the Italians say, al-
dente, to suit the tooth.
Cooking times are subject to irritat-
ing irregularity. They depend upon the
diameter of the strand, but you can
accept these as being my tested times:
Very thin (vermicelli) 6 minutes.
Thin spaghetti 8 minutes.
Maximum-width spaghetti 12 minutes.
The times depend for their accuracy
upon strict adherence to this method:
Boil spaghetti in plenty of boiling
water. Allow 1 gallon for each lib. of
pasta. Add salt at the rate of 1 table-
spoon per gallon of water.
It is vital that the~\vater should never
go from the boil from the moment you
add the spaghetti.
After the suggested time given above,
remove a strand and test it. If correct,
then add 1 pint of ice-cold water to
boiling spaghetti give it a quick stir
and turn it out into a colander to
drain.
Serve immediately on to a warm
plate with its accompanying sauce and
always with a bowl of freshly grated
parmesan cheese (our local variety is
fine for this purpose).
THE SAUCE:
Two fl. oz. olive oil, half stalk celery,
finely chopped, 1 small onion, chopped,
31b. cooking tomatoes, skinned and chop-
per, or 1 large can (320 z.) Italian
tomatoes, 1 clove garlic, teaspoon
salt and \ teaspoon black pepper, \
teaspoon basil, sprig of oregano, 1 bay-
leaf, 2 fl. oz. white wine.
Place oil, celery, onion, and garlic in
saucepan and brown lightly. Add
tomatoes, salt, pepper, and wine and
simmer gently for about 45 minutes.
Add the basil, oregano, and bayleaf.
Cook for 10 minutes longer.
Makes sufficient sauce for 1 pound of
spaghetti.
One-eighth of a pound of butter may
be substituted for the olive oil if pre-
ferred.
Finally comes the problem of eating
the stuff. A dessert-shaped spoon is
held in the left hand, the spaghetti is
twirled on to a fork held in the right
hand. The fork is rotated in a clock-
wise direction.
When a mouth-sized bundle has been
collected it is pressed against the spoon
and the ends are severed. And there
you have it— finito.

The Emerald Scheme
In an article on cotton-growing and
dams (8., May 4) you say “cotton is
usually spoken of as the main income-
earner in the Emerald Scheme” and
go on to say “the prospects for cotton
are not particularly bright.” If you
study reports on the scheme (the latest
presented to the Queensland Parlia-
ment, January, 1968) you will see the
Emerald Scheme is not primarily de-
signed for cotton but fodder for ad-
joining grazing areas, which have a
drought incidence of one year in three.
Emerald is 180 miles from the coast
and about halfway along the central
railway which serves 5.2 million sheep
and 1.2 million cattle. During the last
two years 21 percent of these sheep
and 12 percent of the cattle have
perished. Thus the scheme is needed
to provide insurance against drought
and stabilise production from about
one-quarter of Queensland’s sheep and
cattle.

British Press Council
Your reviewer Mr. Henry Mayer (8.,
April 6) takes me to task for omitting
from the book certain statistics he con-
siders should have been included. Some
of these, however, are not available;
there is, for instance, no record of the
number of complaints to editors dis-
posed of by them which might other-
wise have been taken to the Press Coun-
cil. Again Mayer says that my chief
evidence for thinking that the Press
Council has been a success is that the
early fears, that it would be swamped
with complaints and crippled by libel
actions, that newspapers would not
print its findings and the lay represen-
tatives would vote solidly against the
professional block, have all proved
groundless and, above all, because the
British Press now supports the Council.
Mayer confines himself mainly to a
consideration of the work of the Coun-
cil in maintaining standards. No less
important, however, is the Council’s
task of preserving the established free-
dom of the Press. Fear, based on the
belief that the maintenance of standards
and the preservation of Press freedom
were irreconcilable objectives, largely
accounted for the early opposition of
the Press to the establishment of a Press
Council. Standards involved censor-
ship and censorship had no place in a
free Press. When, in due course, the
Press discovered that the most vigorous
champion of its freedom was the Press
Council itself, opposition began to
crumble.
Mayer observes that the Press Coun-
cil does not have much bite and bites
but rarely. But the fact remains that,
even though the Council has no pow'er
to impose penalties of a punitive nature,
there has been an indisputable improve-
ment in the tone and quality of the
Press since its establishment. The mere
existence of the Council is an effective
deterrent, and newspaper lawyers now
scrutinise copy not only for libel and
other infringements in the law but also
for possible departures from standards
which could result in an editor being
called to account by the Press Council.
The conclusion drawn by Mr. Mayer
that for a modest voluntary levy news-
paper owners have bought a mantle of
moral respectability which protects them
against legislation may have been a fair
assessment of the position at the incep-
tion of the Council in 1953; I believe,
however, as a result of the growing re-
spect and support for the Council since
its reconstitution in 1963, such an
evaluation is today a misconception of
the Council’s stature and authority. The
Press Council is steadily building up a
body of case law which newspapers find
it unwise to disregard even if they were,
disposed to do so.

Improving beef breeds
May I correct a statement in your
article “Improving Breeds by Com-
puter” (8., May 4). The amount of
muscle on beef carcasses of the same
weight in fact varies very significantly
from one to another, as in fact can
be seen from the muscle:bone ratios
quoted in your article. It is the ratio
of the weight of one individual muscle
to another within the carcass which
appears to remain constant, irrespective
of the breed of cattle.
The figure of 55 percent which you
quote is actually the percentage of
“expensive” muscles in relation to the
total amount of muscles on the car-
cass, and this figure remained virtually
constant in all the breeds dissected by
Professor Butterfield. This is the im-
portant finding, as it suggests the failure
of all efforts to breed cattle “with
more meat in the right places.” All
that has been achieved is a difference
in the shape of the animal, due largely
to differences in bone length.

Pope's heresy
The advent of a theology without God
(8., May 11) should provide an excit-
ing stimulus to the physical sciences.
We may now anticipate an avant-garde
system of botany without plants,
chemistry without chemicals, electronic
engineering without electrons, etc.
