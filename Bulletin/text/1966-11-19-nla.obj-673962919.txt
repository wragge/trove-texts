“We would like
to show you what makes a
the
Patek Philippe
ost costly wrist watch
you can 0wn...0r give
Says George Proud
Managing Director of Prouds, Australia’s National Jewellers
99
*O,
George Proud, .
second-generation
head of Prouds,
talks about
Switzerland’s
finest watch.
“There is indeed a watch with a starting price of $425. Its
name is Patek Philippe. It has been the traditional choice of
monarchs and heads of state since 1839. It still is.
“And as you’d expect, it is also the precision leader among
Swiss watches. Eight times during the past ten years, Patek
Philippe took first place in the annual accuracy contest of the
Geneva Observatory.
“We are the only jewellers in Australia to carry this distin-
guished watch. Not only do we regard Patek Philippe as the
finest watch made in Switzerland; we also know that a Patek
Philippe always represents demonstrably fair value.
“I therefore invite you personally to visit a Prouds store in
order to wind a Patek Philippe. (You can actually feel the
difference.)
“Or to compare the movement of a Patek Philippe with that
of a series-produced watch. (You can readily see the difference.)
“Or to let us tell you about the significance of the Geneva
Seal on the movement of a Patek Philippe. (This distinction is
reserved for about one watch in ten thousand.)
“You will then appreciate that, as the owner of a Patek Philippe,
you will have acquired a rare and precious possession which a
grandchild may still be wearing in another day and age.”
Prouds will be pleased to sendyou the latest catalogue of Patek Philippe
horological creations.

WINE
The wine growers story of favoured vintages.
Coonawarra Estate
’65 Riesling
The success of the Rhine
Riesling vines planted at
Coonawarra Estate is shown
by this wine. Bottled within
six months of vintage, the ’65
Riesling has retained fully
the fresh, slightly ‘spritzig’
Riesling character.
Coonawarra Estate
’62 Hermitage
Long weeks of sunshine and
a rain-free vintage period
favoured the sensitive Her-
mitage (Shiraz) grapes in
1962. After two years in oak,
. the wine was bottled and lain
down for further maturing.
Now obtainable, this Hermi-
tage is soft and generous
a full, distinctive wine.
Coonawarra Estate
’6O Cabernet
Made entirely from the rare
Cabernet Sauvignon grape,
this Cabernet was matured at
the Estate for two years in
oak and then further bottle-
matured for four years before
being released for sale. With
a pronounced Cabernet nose,
this wine is full and soft on
the palate, with a firm tannin
finish.
Modbury Estate
’64 Moselle
Riesling grapes vintaged
early in March result in a
light, delicate wine with all
the best characteristics of a
true Moselle. An undertone
of soft fruitiness adds an
intriguing characteristic
which will appeal to those
who prefer a crisp, not too
dry, white wine.
Ovens Valley
’62 Burgundy
A fine, big Northern
Victorian wine grown from
Shiraz, pressed and matured
in oak for three years. Now,,
after bottle-ageing, this soft,
smooth Burgundy is being
released from Wynns. It is a
superb example of the big
wines produced in this area.
Modbury Estate
’64 White Burgundy
Semillion grapes, grown on
gently-contoured Northern
slopes, and expert care have
produced this full, rich
White Burgundy. The ap-
pealing fragrance and flavour
of this vintage earns it pride
of place in any cellar.

LETTERS
Death of a University
Sir,
Professor Bouwsma’s comments (8.,
Oct. 15) on Professor Feuer’s exposure
iof the Berkeley situation (8., Sept. 24)
consist largely of personal abuse. Yet
Bouwsma does commit himself, rather
imprudently, to a factual proposition.
He claims that the recent spate of
I professorial resignations from Berkeley
was unconnected with the Berkeley
putsch of 1964. He should have done
i his homework on what his delinquent
proteges are bragging about more care-
fully before putting pen to paper. In
the October, 1966, issue of “Atlantic
Monthly,” Stephen Weissman, non-
student leader of the Berkeley “Move-
ment” and its present principal ideo-
logist, had this to say in the course
of a letter to the editor, attacking
Feuer’s article: “The Institute for
International Studies—formerly headed
by Seymour Martin Lipset, whose de-
parture from Berkeley is one of the
‘Movement’s ’ major contributions to
intellectual integrity” (italics mine)
“conducts interdisciplinary seminars on
counter-insurgency, whilst Lipset, him-
self, has jeopardised the reputation of
other Berkeley scholars by researching
Latin American student movements for
the Air Force.”
FRANK KNOPFELMACHER

Sir,
Any man would be surprised to find
on his way to work in the morning
that the newspaper was celebrating his
death. Likewise, some thousands of
people at the University of California
in Berkeley were vastly surprised to
discover from the September issue of
“The Atlantic Monthly” that Professor
Lewis Feuer was writing a funeral ora-
tion for their campus. This was the
article summarised (8., Sept. 24) by
Mr. Arnold Beichman under the title
“Death of a University.”
I should like to bring it. to the atten-
tion of your readers that the October
issue of “The Atlantic Monthly” car-
ries comments and criticisms on Feuer’s
article by various faculty members,
administrators, and student leaders of
Berkeley. On some points they differ

How do you cast new light
on Paradise?
More light is on its way to Paradise Island, Bahamas. It’s to be provided
by a new power station on nearby New Providence Island, which is to be
equipped throughout with alternators, switchgear, transformers, motors
and motor starters built and installed by Brush Electrical Engineering—a
Hawker Siddeley company. Brush will supervise everything from the
clearing of land to the final handing over of the key when everything
is complete.
Hawker Siddeley know how.
Brush-Hawker Siddeley Engineering Department is soon
to begin work on a complete new power station to supply
extra electrical power to the islands of Paradise and New
Providence in the Bahamas.
This is nothing new for Brush. They’ve done it more
than 30 times before. And they will be doing it again in
Tanzania, Libya, Antigua and Iran. Their long experience
in building electrical equipment and supervising the
various phases of power station development is world-
proved. It is this sort of expertise that makes Brush and
their export organisation, Hawker Siddeley Electrical
(Export) Ltd., such a valuable part of the Hawker Siddeley
industrial group.
Power stations are only one facet of the Hawker Siddeley
story.
Hawker Siddeley products go down on the farm—haul
trains —steer and power ships—probe space—roll roads —
fly people—store heat —pack food—fuel aircraft. And
maintain a daily turnover of more than million.
That’s what makes Hawker Siddeley a world-size
group. With group power.

among themselves as well as with Pro-
fessor Feuer; some are enthusiastic over
the “revolution” at Berkeley; others
have certain misgivings; but they are
unanimous in their opinion that Ber-
keley is very much alive, and intends
to stay that way. They, like everybody
else at Berkeley, find it hard to under-
stand how Professor Feuer could work
up this story about Berkeley’s being
delivered over to a “dictatorship” of
the “radical left,” and why he would
wish to put across such a piece of sen-
sationalism.
Professor Feuer implies that the
Free Speech Movement has incited
crime and violence; whereas the only
violent acts of the past two years were
perpetrated by the State troopers on
the one hand, who manhandled the
students on a sit-in, and by the mem-
ber of the “radical right” who bombed
the headquarters of the Vietnam Day
Committee. The “radical left” has pre-
sented its- case not by violence but by
argument on the public platform and
in the courts. And, contrary to Profes-
sor Feuer’s assertion, the administration,
faculty, and student body are not
intimidated and tyrannised over by any-
one neither by the radical left nor
the radical right.
From the time that the faculty de-
bated its “December 8, 1964, resolu-
tion,” Professor Feuer has maintained
that over and above the limitations on
freedom of advocacy imposed by the
civil courts, there should be limitations
imposed by the university itself, further
to censor the content of political dis-
cussion. The university as a whole dis-
agrees with Professor Feuer, on grounds
of principle and also practicability. The
student population is made up mostly
of graduate students and doctoral can-
didates in their 20s, of whom I am one.
We are full citizens and conduct our-
selves accordingly. If a small (and
unduly visible) group abuses the free-
dom of speech, then they incur the
penalties of the courts, which are at
least as competent to deal with such
things as are university deans.

Henry Lawson
Sir,
A word in defence of editors, par-
ticularly poetry editors, a very rare
breed indeed. My father, David McKee-
Wright, was Henry Lawson’s editor, a
combined labor of love and despair,
and one which is now being criticised
(8., Oct. 29). According to Lawson,
my father was “blessed with the in-
evitable word” which he, Lawson, was
not. In fact, Lawson’s manuscripts
are peppered with indecisions, some-
times three possible adjectives all left
in for a decision by the editor. That
he trusted the editor was obvious, be-
cause one manuscript has: “Fix it your-
self, Dave” handwritten on the corner,
a nonchalant attitude and one I think
which typifies the poet’s faith in my
father’s touch.
I think “beleaguered” might be a
better word than pernicious or per-
suasive for the editor left to cope while
Lawson, elsewhere and quite confident,
was writing something else. Whether
Andy went to battle, or with the cattle,
Lawson was not the only poet who
leaned heavily on my father’s pen in
his days as poetry editor on THE
BULLETIN.
Good luck to Cecil Hadgraft if he
can sort them all out. Good luck to
Colin Roderick and Cecil Mann, too,
in their efforts to define and tidy up
Henry Lawson. I feel sure the poet
will survive.
APRIL HERSEY
Potts Point (N.S.W.)
Sir,
Regarding the review of two books
concerning Henry Lawson (8., Oct. 29)
and the quoted differences in two ver-
sions of “Andy’s Gone With Cattle”;
perhaps the following will be of inter-
est:
In a footnote to page 42 of his book
“The Making of A Sentimental Bloke”
(first published 1946) Alec H. Chis-
holm writes:
“George Robertson’s last day was
August 27, 1933. By his death Australia
lost its most distinguished publisher.
Regarding his brush with (C. J.) Den-
nis over the choice of phrases, it may
here be recorded that “the old man”
frequently insisted on amendments in
writings and sometimes, notably in the
case of HENRY LAWSON, made them
himself. He once told me (March,
1929) that the first line of Lawson’s
poem ‘‘Faces in the Street” originally
read, “They lie, the men who tell us,
in a loud defiant tone,” and that he
offered Henry a sovereign if he would
amend it. After slight meditation Henry
said, “How would ‘for reasons of their
own’ do?” The sovereign changed
hands immediately.
That was the only time Lawson was
persuaded to amend a verse. All other
alterations were made by Robertson,
David McKee-Wright, and Arthur Jose

Lucky Country Revisited
Sir,
The Russians and, presumably, the
Chinese claim that they have produced
“a new man.” He is the product, they
think, of the Marxist Society. If Aus-
tralia has any claim to distinction it is
that we have in our short historical
experience, starting from the convict
days, when men were deprived of every- ’
thing except their humanity, that we
have produced a type that may ulti-
mately have something new to con-
tribute to the history of man. Those
of us who are avid and enthusiastic
Australians believe that this could be
so, and it is for this reason that we wish
to give Australianism a go. We accept
the charge of brashness, of isolation, of
materialism, and any other charges
which discerning critics such as Donald
Horne bring against us.
Our harvest time is not yet. Give
us time: perhaps a hundred years. If
critics are impatient, let them look at
their own 'society in its entirety. In the
meantime we are sceptical of words
and high-sounding theorising; but we’ll
pass the hat around for a few bob to
help a mate who has lost his job or

When Rover set out
to design the ‘2ooo’
they threw the book away. There
is nothing of standard pattern
about this car, no concession to “popular”
taste. What Rover did was to design a car
from the tyres up not according to how
cars were, but according to how they
should be. For instance, a car should “go”
and it also should stop. So the ‘2ooo’ has a
totally new overhead camshaft engine that
produces tremendous thrust. It can go
like a rocket. But it also has disc brakes all
round and radial ply tyres so it can stop
faster, more safely than any car you’ve
ever driven. A car should “handle” per-
fectly under all road conditions. So the
‘2ooo’ got itself a totally new suspension,
so good that the motoring writers have run
THEY CALL THE
ROVER
2DOO
THE ABSOLUTE CAR
out of superlatives. A car should protect
its occupants. So Rover designed the pas-
senger compartment as a rigid steel cage,
buffered at each end by a bonnet and boot
which “accordion” gradually on impact.
Then they carefully built in an incredible
fifty safety features. (They’re illustrated in
a leaflet we'll gladly send you.) Finally, a
car should have three personalities to suit
the mood of the driver. It should be a rip-
roaring sports car, a long-loping, mile-
eating, businessman’s express and a
lavishly-appointed luxury limousine. The
Rover ‘2ooo’ is all these things. It is the
mailed fist in the velvet glove. It is the
absolute car.
Get one.

find their way into so many shops, offices, restaurants and work rooms.
Here’s why!

A Carrier packaged unit is big enough to control temperature and humidity
in places too large for a small air conditioner. Yet it’s compact so you
can tuck it discreetly away in a corner, standing on its own base. One of
the Carrier range of packaged units the 50K8, 50K10, the new 50K14 or
the 50K16 is exactly right for your premises. It will run so quietly
you’ll never know it’s there. And in winter it looks after heating too . . .

whose missus has died: do the mates of
Donald Horne do any more or any
better?
E. F. WHITFIELD
Greenwich, (N.S.W.)
Sir,
Instead of mowing the front lawn
this weekend, I engaged my neighbor in
a spirited discussion of Eskimo stone
carvings. Caught up in the exhil-
aration of cultural self-realisation, we
went on to exchange recipes for Boeuf
Stroganoff. Mr. Horne would have
been so proud!
One finds it difficult to accept that
D. Horne really believes what he writes.
Is it possible to recall the long list of
famous Australians and reflect on the
contributions they have made to art,
science, music, literature, etc., and write
off Australia’s contribution to history as
the “invention of suburbs”?
Horne’s “Lucky Country” was bad
enough—“ Revisited” is worse.
Take a random selection of one
thousand people from any nation on
earth and I will back one thousand
from Australia to be superior in any
and every activity, from flat-dwelling
to long-distance spitting! Our record
speaks for itself. She’ll be right, mate!
E. SADLER
Henley Beach (S.A.)
Sir,
Revisited indeed! I should say that
Donald Horne’s contribution (8., Oct.
8) was a parochial embellishment of
Sydney life except for “hello-goodbye”
rocket-like calls at Broken Hill, the
Centre, down into the Arafura Sea,
to emerge once again to wallow in
the glory of Sydney suburbia and, of
course, an irresistible un-Australian
veiled jibe at the RSL and Anzac Day.
“Tassie” was covered in six words.
How thoughtful!
How about the awakening industrial
romance in Western Australia, the N.T.,
and the Federal political Cinderella
State of Queensland? —even though it
can only “sport” an emergency tin
shed for an International Air Terminal,
“slapped up” a quarter of a century
ago?
Furthermore, how about the pastoral-
agricultural industries and the life of
their genuine people? Yair, how about
that?
However, now our American cousins
will have had an opportunity of scan-
ning the pages of that remarkable cur-
rent look at “The Australians.”

The Radical Right
Sir,
Shorn of “smear-words”, the pre-
sentation of known facts in Brian Buck-
ley’s article “The Radical Right” (8.,
Oct. 15) is fairly reasonable. But to
label those who support the indepen-
dence of Rhodesia and the principle of
apartheid as a means of dealing with

Executives, $456 per man is virtually a no-risk investment probably less
than the bonus you pay right now. Plan the work schedule as tight as you like

effects are far longer-

relaxation of the trip

an eye-opener. It jingles,
it jangles, it jostles, it
jives. It’s the melting pot
of the Orient that your
man shares with 4 million
others. He’ll dine like
an emperor and live

see new ideas and new
people that will sharpen
his perception and widen
his outlook. Most likely
he’ll bring back some
bargains, too Hong
Kong is a free port, and
a paradise for shopping.
Frankly, there isn’t an

South Africa’s particular racial prob-
lems “rat-bag right” is neither fair
nor reasonable. Geoffrey Fairbairn’s
letter “Right-wing extremists” (8., Oct.
8), dealing with the so-called “Right”
in a different context, is by compari-
son to be commended.
C. C. USHER
Hornsby (N.S.W.)
Sir,
I ask that you publish the enclosed
letter. However, I am well aware that
you would give your Communist-in-
spired muck-raking journalists every
opportunity to smear respectable people
as in “The Radical Right” (8., Oct.
15), but deny the right of those people
to reply.
I have been connected with The
Australian League of Rights for some
time (though not a member) and deny
that it is anti-Semitic or racist. I have
attended several of their meetings and
take their weekly “On Target” and
have never heard the word Jew men-
tioned. I agree with their Rhodesian
policy and support lan Smith until
such time as a suitable alternative can
be found capable of providing the pro-
tection of law and order and preventing
a blood bath such as the Congo. I also
support their opposition to the Com-
munist-inspired exploitation of the
Negro race throughout the world. It is
not surprising to me that a journalist
should write such an article, but it is
surprising that a paper such as THE
BULLETIN should publish it.
A. H. ALAINSY
Tintinara (S.A.)
Sir,
Good insight into Right-wing think-
ing in Australia was contained in Mr.
Fairbairn’s letter (8., Oct. 8). In con-
trast to the League of Rights, his think-
ing is much more subtle, appearing, as
it does, as a holy crusade against Com-
munism. These people, without
realising it, are out to destroy those
very things which Australians consider
worth fighting for.
It would not surprise me if Lenin
included Right-wing extremists when
he spoke of the inherent internal sick-
ness of the democracies. Perhaps he
realised that in their own way Right-
wingers would assist Communism in its
aim of world domination and in this
respect Right-wingers are just as much
fellow travellers of the Communists
as Left-wingers.
My objection to conscription is be-
cause I believe that the cost in the long-
run of forcing a country’s young men
to defend it is far greater than a short-
run large cash outlay to improve pay
and conditions in the Army and so
attract sufficient volunteers to defend
Australia. This long-run cost can’t be
measured in terms of cash, so people
tend to think that it doesn’t exist. But
you don’t get anything for nothing.
It is a cost in terms of a devaluation
of the advantages of living in Australia,
and it must ultimately reveal itself as
a diminishing of the will to resist
further retrenchments of freedom.
However, I am not suggesting the
Government is Right-wing because it
introduced conscription. Indeed, I
t ink it is to the Governments credit
that in a society in which it seems
fashionable to line up Left or Right its
responsible members have remained
largely centre, and I hope they remain
there ‘
GEOFFREY BALDOGK
Houghton (S~A.)
Bath-house Girl
Sir
As your reviewer Nancy Keesing
(8., Nov. 5) does not regard my book
“A Maid From Heaven” as a success-
ful, serious novel about the White Aus-
tralia Policy, may I be allowed to give
my views on this subject in non-
fictional form?
I regard our present migration policy

policy is riddled through with racial-
ism. A young student in Taipei said to
me: “Why do Australia and South
Africa follow racialist policies?” He
thereby destroyed in a few words any
illusion one might have had that Asians
benignly overlook what is to them a
deadly insult. The policy in its present
form must go. No sane person advocates
that we immediately open our doors.
But we must announce once and for all
that no Chinese, Indian, Japanese, or
other Asian will be excluded just be-
cause he is not white.
Not enough credit has been given to
the present Minister for Immigration
and his Department for their method-
ical and humane relaxation of the
policy. But what is needed is a public
renunciation of our racialist policy by
the Government, the Press, and Church.

THE HANGING
86 Years Ago: November 20, 1880
KELLY was duly hanged on
Thursday. The man by whose
hands he died was Upjohn, the new
executioner, who had not before
“made a man swing at the end of
a string.” Kelly took matters quietly,
and when confronted with the gal-
lows merely remarked, in unconscious
paraphase of the historical dying re-
mark of blind King George, “Such is
life.” The writer does not sympathise
with crime or criminals. He would
not, under existing circumstances,
have lifted up a finger to save Kelly
from the hangman. But society had
done very little for Ned Kelly. The
felon’s parents were and are criminals.
The first recollections of his child-
hood were those of stolen bullocks,
whose flesh he helped to eat of
stolen horses which he helped to
drive away. Kelly was brave, but he
was ferocious and revengeful to the
last degree as is almost every man
whose animal spirits have not in a
measure been broken by education or
extinguished by what we call civilisa-
tion. He said, when about to be sen-
tenced, that he was not afraid. What
a pity that the man who, to use his
own rude words, could face the
Destroyer as “easily as he could
drink a cup of tea,” should die by
the rope instead of riding to death
in the van of a Light Brigade! I
know that what I have written will
be unpopular, but if a story hasn’t
always two sides it very often has
one and a half. I am a sportsman,
and don’t like to see a fine animal
or brute, if you like to call it so,
slaughtered with its paws tied. Capital
punishment is a satire on Christianity
and, in piy opinion, causes as many
crimes as it prevents. While on this
subject, let me say that every reader
of THE BULLETIN should peruse
the pamphlet on “Capital Punish-
ment,” by Mr. Taylor, of the Public
Library, Hobart Town.

Face of the Week
A record total of 454 candidates
nominated for the Federal elections
on November 26, including 25
servicemen who had resigned to
campaign, and 20 Liberal Reform
Group candidates in N.S.W. and
Victoria. All the organised party
leaders delivered their policy
speeches during the week, and be-
gan campaign meetings. Medium to
heavy rain fell from Whyalla to
Broken Hill, throughout N.S.W. and
north of Brisbane, where the Bris-
bane City Council began to investi-
gate low-level flooding which could
have been disastrous had the rain
continued. The 6th Australian Book
Week was opened in Adelaide. In
London, composer Malcolm Wil-
liamson completed an opera for
a November 29 premiere. Margaret
Smith retired from competitive
tennis.

A Dutch clairvoyant came to
Adelaide to find the three missing
Beaumont children, but left defeated.
A poll of academics at 10 universities
had a 34 percent response to ques-
tions on Vietnam policy, 54 percent
against and 30 in favor. In Queens-
land, decision was reserved on a
police application for better pay and
conditions. The High Court dis-
missed former teacher William
White’s appeal against a verdict that
he must do National Service. A
Toowoomba murder trial was post-
poned when five witnesses appeared
drunk. In Melbourne the Langley
brothers, who threw paint on Presi-
dent Johnson’s car, were fined $6BO,
with $1732 damages to pay. South
Australia introduced a Bill to set
up a Government Insurance Office.
The world modern pentathlon

Remembrance Day was celebrated.
Queensland University fees were in-
creased by 9 percent. The U.S. sub-

an agreement on the price of natural
gas had been reached, and would
eventually save Victorian users 25
percent on their bills. A dispute
between Victoria and S.A. on defini-
tion of the off-shore borders, where
oil drilling is planned, could not be
settled. The Prime Minister of Malta
said his government would give slJ-

NOVEMBER 19, 1966
No Kidding
TIITHAT a feeble set of policy
"" speeches they were! The
Prime Minister’s was the same
long dreary run-through of the
nation’s business, the same mild
criticisms of the Labor Party, the
same conservative if responsible
exposition of the problems we face.
The best that can be said for it
is that it was at least a claim for
support that can be seriously con-
sidered which is more than can
be said of the claim of Her
Majesty’s Opposition as repre-
sented by the weary figure of
Mr. Arthur Calwell. TV viewers
must have felt rather sad as they
watched this grand old man, who
has at times tried so hard, acting
out his last few weeks in Aus-
tralian politics. There was so much
pathos in his tired act, in the
humorless extravagance with
which he assaulted Mr. Holt’s
mild-mannered Government (that
“bellicose menace”), in the extra-
ordinary shopping list of Govern-
mental wares he displayed, and in
the nice words from Longfellow
at the end. As for the Country
Party, its appeal was as usual
directed to the pocket, and the
pocket only. It was not even a
convincing appeal to material
self-interest in view of the Depart-
ment of Trade and Industry’s
cynical series of deals and hand-
outs to small interest groups. Mr.
McEwen’s expensive bid to gain
city support by handing out indus--
trial tariff protection all around
not only damages the nation’s
capacity for growth but adversely
affects the farmers he is supposed
to be representing.
There is, of course, no question
that the Government should be
returned. The Liberals in their
fumbling apologetic way can be
relied on to get around eventually
to doing the things which need
to be done. They will not take
the country into a dreamworld in
which Communist terror is spon-
taneous and harmless peasant pro-
test; they will not kid Australia
that it is a Luna Park island
Utopia which can avoid facing
up to the real nastiness of the
times; they will not waste their
energies in an endless, unproduc-
tive internecine feud. They are
slow-moving, complacent and
short-sighted, but they are the
the best Government available.
If there was one encouraging
thing in the set of policy speeches
it was the performance of ,the
DLP. There were the sharp, tell-
ing cuts at the old ALP, at the
boy-scoutery of Mr. Whitlam and
at the consequences of putting a
Dr. Cairns in power. There was
also the voice of the true Opposi-
tion: a sensible and reasoned
attack on the Government’s tardi-
ness in getting our defences in
order, a powerful critique of the
danger of assuming that the U.S.
will always come to our aid and
that we can be satisfied with the
small contribution we are making
to the military protection and
economic advance of the region
in which we live. There were
valuable proposals for develop-*
ment and social justice at home.
The DLP can never be more than
a ginger group, but it is needed
to urge the Government along
while the Labor Party remains
in the hands of dreamers and
enemies of the free society.

THIS AUSTRALIA
Political Commercials
The one unforgettable moment of last week’s spate of policy speeches on tele-
vision did not even come in one of the speeches proper but in a fantastic com-
mercial preceding the talk of the Country Party Leader, Mr. J. McEwen.
To demonstrate how unreliable the
ALP would be in government, Mr.
McEwen flourished a copy of Australia’s
Trade Agreement with Japan, de-
nounced the ALP for having opposed
it, and then in a burst of energy tore
the paper to shreds and threw the pieces
dramatically away, proclaiming as he
did so something like . . . “The ALP
would have had me tear up this treaty
and throw it away.”
The rest of the commercial showed
the two young hopefuls of the Country
Party, Messrs. Anthony and Sinclair,
weighing in with staccato bursts of five
seconds each about Vietnam, close-ups
of hands clapping away to the sound
of canned applause, and some shots of
an audience which, I assume, was sup-
posed to give the Country Party flavor.
The effect of this commercial on at least
one viewer was the opposite of the new
with-it look the Country Party is trying
to achieve. It was an amateur produc-
tion, years behind in technique, and
laughable in content. But it was unfor-
gettable.
As for the less memorable policy
speeches themselves it is clear that
the two major parties, after ten years
of television, still do not understand
the difference between an old-style
policy speech delivered in a hall and
the kind of message best suited to tele-
vision. The two smaller parties seemed
to understand the difference, but were
not altogether successful in their hand-
ling of the distinctive demands of the
medium. But at least they acknowledged
them. Not so the Liberals or the ALP.
Both speeches suffered from so many
fundamental blunders that in terms of
impact they probably cancelled them-
selves out. Both were far too long, they
were too detailed; they were not written
for television; they were given to a studio
audience and not to the mass audience
out there in television land; they lacked
any sense of drama or conflict or
involvement essentials for television.
First, the question of length. Forty
or forty-five minutes is just far too
long. Even Sir Robert Menzies, who
has been held up as the shining
example, made heavy weather of it
after about 20 minutes’ straight talk.
Mr. Holt would have lost many view-
ers before that. If political leaders
have to speak for 45 minutes then
they should do so only if they make
concessions to the viewer. Mr. Holt
made hardly any beyond an occasional
change in picture from him in medium
shot to him in half profile with a map
of South-East Asia behind him. There
were more frequent glimpses of the
carefully coiffured debutantes of
Toorak who, with their boy-friends
and fathers in the studios of GTV9,
applauded dutifully everything Mr.
Holt said, however unremarkable.
Mr. Calwell’s speech, although only
a few minutes longer, seemed by com-
parison, ages longer. Mr. Holt spent
hours rehearsing his speech and used
an Autocue, a device which enabled
him to look at the camera and follow
his speech as it revolved past on a
sheet mounted on top of the camera
lens. This helped to make it look as
if he was speaking ad lib. Mr. Calwell
made the mistake of reading his speech
and reading it badly. Even the most
mellow-voiced and impressive of orators
would find it hard going to keep a TV
audience for 45 minutes by reading
the most enthralling story.
Television is the cruellest of media
and it showed Mr. Calwell as tired,
under-rehearsed, and hesitating over
unfamiliar words. This is where tele-
vision can distort a policy, however
sound, however attractive.
Secondly, the question of detail.
There was far too much of it. The
long listing of proposals punctuated by
reverent applause became like a mono-
tonous grind after a while and I lapsed
into reverie about the 20-minute-
mark with Mr. Holt and about the
15-minute mark with Mr. Calwell. Tele-
vision demands broad generalisations,
a few proposals, one or two catchy
phrases, an unusual idea. It cannot
digest lists of proposals about medical
benefits or superphosphate subsidies,
especially when there is no illustration
to go with them. Television is a total
medium and needs reinforcement of
both audio and visual senses.
Thirdly, neither of the speeches was
written for television. The sentences
were too long, to convoluted. There
was hardly any attempt at the telling
phrase, the special cadence, the rhythm
of the spoken, as distinct from the writ-
ten, word.
Fourthly, the speeches were given to
a studio or friendly audience. In Mr.
Holt’s case they were Liberal supporters
from his electorate and they were
“warmed up” by Graham Kennedy. In
Mr. Calwell’s case they were fellow
Labor parliamentarians like Senator
Cohen, Dr. Cairns, Mr. Crean, and
Mr. Whitlam, and trade union officials
and Party supporters who applauded
even more loudly than Mr. Holt’s
audience. The trouble with such audi-
ences is that they give the speakers a
false sense of security and approval.
They are warm when the camera lens
is cold. They tend to make the speaker
forget that he does not have to impress
them but unseen thousands or millions.
The Liberals compounded this failure
to be aware of the audience by padding
the speech with agricultural proposals
which would have very limited interest
to the great mass of viewers city
dwellers largely unconcerned about
superphosphate subsidies.
Fifthly, the need for drama. This is
not achieved by just attacking the
opposing party. It can be achieved by
the art of rhetoric, by the telling
phrase, above all by the humanising
and dramatising of events. There was
not one example of this in either speech.
Instead of giving meaningless figures
about so many millions for this and
so many for that we should have had
examples which would mean something.
Take education —instead of quoting
figures Mr. Holt should have quoted a
human example, the story of a young
student who wants to become a teacher
—what would the Government do for
him, step by step? If Mr. Calwell
wanted to dramatise the Ord, why talk
about budgets or plans? Give us a
human story of one Ord farmer and
what it means to him and his family.
The best example of this sort of
dramatising came during Senator Gair’s
policy speech for the DLP. Instead of
going into long arguments about
Defence, he gave what is probably an
unfair example (the name of the game
is politics) about the lamentable lack of
helicopters. If all our helicopters were
used, said Senator Gair, we could trans-
port only 100 men into battle at the
one time. Isn’t that a fantastic thing?
asked Senator Gair. Isn’t it, indeed?
Both Senator Gair and Mr. McEwen
gave different speeches on television


than their long policy speeches. Both
were especially written for television.
Mr. McEwen wrote his himself and
memorised it without the use of
Autocue. Senator Gair’s speech was
written with the help of advertising
agents and he used the Autocue. Both
speeches were mercifully short Mr.
McEwen’s was 15 minutes and Senator
Gair’s 10. In gratitude, I forgive them
any weakness in presentation.

N.S.W.'S
Swingers
If the ALP was generally considered
an acceptable alternative at least seven
Government-held seats in N.S.W.
would be likely to fall on November
26. But as polling day draws nearer
and the absurdity of Labor’s foreign
policy and the new extravagance of its
domestic promises become clearer, the
chances of a major swing against the
Government in N.S.W. are remote.
The best Labor can expect is to win
three seats, Hume, Parkes, and Mit-
chell, but it will also be battling to
hold both Eden-Monaro and Barton.
By far the best prospects for the
ALP are in Hume, a sprawling rural
seat in southern N.S.W., which has
“swung” six times in the past 20 years.
It is now held by Mr. J. A. Pettit, a
farmer, for the Country Party. Labor
candidate Mr. John Menadue is pri-
vate secretary to Deputy Opposition
Leader Mr. E. G. Whitlam. In 1963
Mr. Pettit emerged with a majority of
only 610, and a swing of a mere .79
percent would tip him out. Menadue
is young 33 a graduate of Ade-
laide University and was a Treasury
research officer before joining Mr.
Whitlam’s staff. He is pushing hard,
and the Country Party is worried.
Mr. Leslie Haylen lost Parkes at the
J 903 elections to the Liberal Mr.
T. E. F. Hughes, QC, after a bitter
battle that virtually ended Haylen s
political career. (He made an unsuc-
cessful attempt at a comeback in the
following Senate poll.) Haylen’s foreign
policy pronouncements and failure to
care fully for the “grass roots” of the
electorate alienated many Labor sup-
porters. The new ALP candidate, Mr.
D. Sutherland, a local alderman and
accountant, can be expected to win
some back and generally be a more
formidable opponent for Hughes.
Sutherland also is 33 years old. The
character of Parkes has not shown any
significant change since 1963 when
Hughes won with a majority of 1320
votes. A swing of more than 1.71 per-
cent would upset him.
The electorate of Mitchell, centred
on the fast-developing western suburb
of Blacktown, covers an area of 1288
square miles and, with just over
100,000 enrolled, is the second-biggest
electorate in Australia. J. L. Armitage
won it for the ALP in 1961, but it
swung to the Liberal L. H. Irwin in
1963. Armitage, who is now assistant
secretary of the N.S.W. Party,
lost the seat because of his personal
dogmatism and his failure to give suf-
ficient attention to the needs of his
electors. Although Irwin was in hos-
pital for the last three weeks of the
1963 campaign Armitage went down.
Irwin, however, has not distinguished
himself in Canberra, and this time is
opposed by a bustling ALP candidate,
Peter McLoughlin, a Blacktown builder.
Since 1963 the number enrolled has
risen by 14,000 —mostly in the lower-
income suburbs of Blacktown and Lalor
Park —and Mitchell must be considered
a real swinger. On the 1963 figures,
Irwin had a 4936 majority and a swing
of 3.1 percent would be needed to
defeat him.

however, the ALP in Barton and Eden-
Monaro faces survival problems. In Bar-
ton, Mr. L. J. Reynolds, who followed
the late Dr. H. V. Evatt as member,
has a majority of only 611 and a swing
of more than .67 percent would put him
out. Reynolds’ fate will be decided in
the new and developing areas such as
Oatley and Woniora and in the estab-
lished suburbs of Ramsgate and
Brighton-le-Sands. A good and active
member, Reynolds’ greatest handicap is
his party’s foreign policy.
The political last rites have been said
over Allan Fraser in Eden-Monaro at
almost every election since the early
’fifties, but he still manages to survive.
This time Fraser is down to a meagre
majority of 788, and a movement of
more than 2.15 percent would end his
career. Although the outlook for Fraser
is gloomy, he is such an astute politician
that once again hp could defy the
prophets.
Victoria ALP Nemesis
Unlike the stars in Texas, the chances of the ALP deposing any Government
Member in Victoria are not big and bright. Labor has not taken a seat from the
Government since the Flinders by-election of 1952. The Liberal Party came closest to
a defeat in 1961 when Mr. Stokes was nearly toppled in the north-western Melbourne
suburb of Maribyrnong.
Now that Mr. Stokes has re-estab-
lished himself in Maribyrnong he
had a majority of five percent in
1963 the only seat Labor has much
hope of winning from the Liberal and
Country Parties is Corio, which is
mostly composed of the bayside town
of Geelong. The enthusiasm of Mrs.
Maureen Campbell-Teich has raised
the expectations of some Labor sup-
porters in Bruce, but her chances of
defeating the Liberal Backbencher, Mr.
Fox, seem forlorn.
Corio is held by the Minister for
Immigration, Mr. Opperman, whose
popularity ebbs and flows according
to the publicity given to his Govern-
ment’s immigration policies. Things
have been fairly quiet lately, and unless
some huge immigration scandal ex-
plodes in the next week, it seems un-
likely that Labor can force the 3.5
percent swing necessary to capture the
town of Geelong and the surrounding
countryside.
For the Liberals there are fond ex-
pectations of adding to their portfolio
the seats of Batman and Bendigo, and
some hope of winning Yarra (Dr.
Cairns), Wills (Mr. Bryant), and
Darebin (Mr. Courtnay).
The seat of Batman, consisting largely
of the northern suburbs Heidelberg and
Northcote, is the scene of a tough three-
cornered contest between Captain Sam
Benson and his Liberal and Labor
opponents. The Government candidate,
Mr. Bruce Skeggs, is the nominal
favorite, but his association with Grups
at the extreme right edge of the Liberal
Party is a handicap, and he cannot
match Captain Benson in personal
popularity in the district.
The ALP, which appeared certain
to lose the seat by a big margin, has
made something of a comeback by
choosing a candidate whose name begins
with “A” and thus winning the top
position on the ballot paper. Its candi-
date, Councillor Andersen, is also popu-
lar in the district, but in the event of
the seat being decided by the
preferences of either Benson or Skeggs
he will be battling against the odds.
With DLP preferences Benson may rise
above the Labor candidate on the
second count, and then the seat will be
decided on ALP preferences. Officially,
the unforgiving ALP has given these to
the Liberals, but the percentage of
Labor voters who refuse to follow this
lead and who vote straight down the
ticket could be high.
A swing of slightly more than three
percent is needed to unseat Labor’s Mr.
Beaton in Bendigo. Gallup poll figures
suggest that the Government could gain
up to five percent in the nation gener-
ally, but even in that event Mr.
Beaton’s personal following will work
in his favor.
Swings toward the Government of
around seven percent will place the
Labor seats of Wills, Darebin, and Yarra
in jeopardy. In Dr. Cairns’ electorate
the Liberals are fighting a stronger cam-
paign than usual in the hope of cap-
turing a substantial number of votes in
the suburb of Hawthorn, where cream-
and-pink brick flats are rising out of the
ground like mushrooms in autumn. An
extra worry for Dr. Cairns emerged
about 30 seconds before nominations
for the seat closed, in the form of Mr.
Bruno Bonomo, an Italian migrant who
has polled well in local municipal elec-
tions. Cairns, although a firm favorite
for the seat, could get a fright when
the total distribution of votes for Mr.
Hawkins (Liberal) go on the board.
In Victoria, the score at the moment
for the Lower House is: Liberal Party,
one seat slightly doubtful; Labor Party,
one likely defeat, one doubtful, three
slightly doubtful. In the Senate the
Country Party sitting Member should
win.
Tasmania
In Tasmania, only one result appears
to be in doubt. Mr. Falkinder, who
held the seat of Franklin for the Liberal
Party for 20 years, has resigned, and a
keen battle is being waged by a Liberal
dairy farmer and a Labor orchardist
for the seat.
A one percent swing would win the
seat for Labor, which already holds
three of the other four House of
Representatives seats in Tasmania. The
Liberal candidate for Franklin, Mr.
Pearsall, may suffer from an expected
decline in DLP votes. Mr. Pearsall is
a former member of the Tasmanian
Lower House, but his opponent, Mr.
Parsons, is expected at least to match
him in personal popularity.
According to the reports in these pages prepared by a team of staff and
correspondents in all States, the Liberal-CP Coalition Government will be
returned on November 26, but there are 10 Government seats in doubt, some
slightly, some seriously. Offsetting these doubtful Government seats are the pos-
sible losses the ALP faces in nine seats. As with the Government’s doubtfuls,
some of these seats would require a slight swing, others a very strong one
against the ALP. According to THE BULLETIN writers, Mr. Holt looks like
leading the next Government with much the same sort of majority as he has now,
71-53. This seemed to be the position at the end of the first week of campaigning.

S.A. -The Dynasty Makers
South Australia has 11 Federal seats, most of them either within the Adelaide
metropolitan area or radiating out of it like slices of cake shakily cut from the
centre. But partywise the division is as neat as may be—Labor six and the Liberal
and Country League five.
It is so well trimmed that nothing
short of a sudden lurch is likely to
change it. And of that there is no sign,
Vietnam and conscription notwith-
standing.
The main local interest of this elec-
tion is that the Liberals are attempting
a dynastic, father to son operation in
two electorates and there is bound to
be a doubt whether it will come off in
both cases. In Sturt, Sir Keith Wilson
is hoping to hand over to his elder
son, lan. Sir John McLeay, the retiring
Speaker, is planning to do the same
thing for the McLeays in Boothby.
This seems a natural South Australian
ploy, but it must put some strain on
the less ardent party loyalties.
lan Wilson has been groomed for
the succession almost, one suspects,
since he came back from Oxford. Eight
years ago, when he was only 26, he
stood for Adelaide: a hopeless Liberal
exercise other than as an experience,
though he did better than most. A
Rhodes scholar and a quiet-voiced law-
yer, he has followed the furrow his
father ploughed among the old people
and migrants. He is a number of good
things vice-president of the Good
Neighbor Council, a church warden, an
executive member of the British and
Foreign Bible Society, and a director
on the board of an old folks’ home.
The ALP is matching him with a
child psychiatrist, Dr. Keith Le Page,
but the contrast is not as sharp as it
looks. Le Page is just as interested in
pensioners as Wilson is. He is a good-
looking 40, has an RAAF background,
and played football for Norwood for
ten years. Wilson pere left the seat well-
cushioned for his son. Apart from a dip
in 1961, he held Sturt for a good many
years with majorities round the 8000
mark, and it would need a pretty big
desertion to keep his son out. The un-
predictable thing is, of course, how
much unspoken objection to family
arrangements is likely to show against
Wilson fils. If Wilson does succeed to
Wilson, the presiding figure of the
dynasty will undoubtedly be the ener-
getic, able, and (for her family) am-
bitious Lady Wilson.
In Boothby, the McLeay heir is also
John. He has been running the family
carpet business for some time and,
politically, has been brought up, as
Sir John was, as a councillor and mayor.
He is 44, less of an extrovert than his
father, but popular enough—it couldn’t
have been entirely the McLeay name—
to carry the pre-selection ballot against
young Robin Millhouse, the local
State member and enfant adorable of
Liberal suburbia, who is believed to
have had his eye on this seat and Can-
berra for several years.
Of the two inheritances, the Wilson
one is the larger but not perhaps the
safer. The McLeay majority was not
at all healthy in 1961, but by 1963 it
was 4000 votes clear of the Labor field,
and there is nothing to suggest that
the seat is becoming more blue-collared.
The new McLeay’s opponent is Thomas
Sheehy, who held the seat for Labor
from 1943 to 1949. Sheehy, attempting
a comeback after nearly 20 years, looks
far less formidable than psychiatrist-
cum-Norwood footballer, that lan Wil-
son faces.
In Angas, another young Liberal in
his political machine is fighting his
first full Federal election, but with more
assurance. Geoffrey Giles succeeded to
the seat in 1964 when Sir Alexander
Downer sold up his Georgian house in
the Adelaide Hills and settled fot the
life of an English gentleman as High
Commissioner for Australia in London.
Giles won the by-election with an 8000
majority, which, while about 3000 short
of the majorities which Sir Alex grew
accustomed to, was a handsome start.
Angas is a Hills and Murray River
electorate, and Giles’ opponent is again
Robert Neilson, the river orchardist
who ran against him in 1964. There are
strong Labor pockets along the river,
as the State elections show, but Angas
Pat Galvin
Dr. Forbes


(to which Giles, as an engaging new
boy, has paid a lot of attention) is
among the safer Liberal seats.
The one Labor seat which shows a
shadow of a doubt is Kingston, where
Pat Galvin is being pursued a second
time by Miss Kay Brownbill. In 1963
she got within 7000 votes of him, which
was better, than anyone else had done,
and it encouraged her to try again.
Kay Brownbill is on the “Advertiser’s”
public relations staff, and a radio and
TV performer with an over-studied
manner. She will probably do even bet-
ter than she did three years ago; even
so, it is hard to see her pushing Galvin
very closely unless the new homes and
mortgages of Kingston are changing
the balance of the electorate faster than
new industry.
Solid Seats
The rest of the South Australian
seats, Liberal and ALP, are fairly solid,
or to use the “in” word for most solid
things here—stable. For Labor, Clyde
Cameron rules in Hindmarsh without an
LCL challenger. Port Adelaide is as
unchanging as Port Melbourne, while
Bcnython, which centres on the satel-
lite and largely migrant town of Eliza-
beth 12 miles north of Adelaide, is as
Labor as any of them. Its discontents
probably make it more so.
Grey, an enormous electorate corner-
ing the entire western half of the State,
is largely Labor on the strength of
Whyalla and Pirie and returns almost
automatic majorities of 5000 for Jack
Mortimer. Adelaide, a shrinking elec-
torate and once a swinging seat, has also
settled for Labor. Since J. C. Sexton
took over the seat from Cyril Cham-
bers, the former Minister for the Army,
he has had his worries, but nothing
very serious. In 1963 he was clear of
the field by 6000 votes.
Much the same can be said of the
two Liberal seats not so far mentioned.
Dr. Forbes, the Minister for Health
and the State’s only Federal Minister,
holds Barker in the South-East com-
fortably; and Wakefield, a sprawling
electorate in the North, is Kelly coun-
try. Charles Kelly took over the seat
from Sir Philip Mcßride in 1958 and
he has had no need of armor. At the
last election he turned in a 9000
majority, which was not far short of
the best Mcßride showing.
There is no Liberal Reform Group
in South Australia yet; and the barely
sighted Country Party of S.A., though
affiliated with the Federal party, has
not nominated, preferring to keep its
strength for the next State elections. The
DLP is contesting eight of the 11 seats,
but in the electorates where it might
otherwise have been able to make itself
felt—in Boothby, Sturt, and Kingston
—it has (on the 1963 figures) been
losing ground.
To sum up: it is unlikely that there
will be any changes in South Aus-
tralia. As for issues, Vietnam and
conscription look like being much less
conspicuous than pensions and State
Aid.
Queensland Labor’s Hope
Queensland and New South Wales are usually bracketed as the States where
the 1966 election will be decided. In 1961 the credit squeeze and the Government’s
blatant neglect of a State which seemed permanently in its hip-pocket broke the
Menzies-Fadden dominance in Queensland.
Mr. Calwell won back two seats lost
in ’5B, plus another six which had not
appeared in the Labor column for
years. Only Mr. Killen and a few hun-
dred voters in the suburban electorate
of Moreton stood between Mr. Calwell
and the Lodge. In 1963 the Labor
vote declined in Brisbane electorates as
memories of the squeeze faded; three
swung back to the Liberals Bow-
man, Lilley, and Petrie.
But, despite a general trend against
Labor, some of its new men continued
to dig in, and even increase their
majorities. In February of this year
the Dawson by-election confirmed that
a Labor tide was still running in north-
ern Queensland at least.
Safe Seats
It is difficult to see why the Govern-
ment should lose any of the seats it
held in 1961. For the Country Party
Mr. Adermann is safe in Fisher, and
Kevin Cairns
Wylie Gibbs
despite the eruption of “Tiger” Bren-
nan into McPherson, the failings of
Australian colonial policy are not going
to be resolved by shifting Mr. Barnes.
Maranoa which could have put Sir
William Gunn into politics is having
a battle of shire chairmen instead, and
would need an implausible swing of
six percent to go Labor. For the Lib-
erals Mr. Swartz is safe in Darling
Downs and Mr. Nigel Drury, a possible
Speaker, should romp home in Ryan.
Labor, too, has its safe seats. Leich-
hardt, Capricornia, and. Wide Bay
could survive ALP losses of up to seven
to nine percent. In Brisbane, Griffith,
the depopulating inner urban area south
of the river, is safer than a five per-
cent swing would suggest, and despite,
or perhaps because of, being opposed
by both Liberal and Country candi-
dates Bill Hayden seems certain to. re-
tain Oxley. The Country Party claims
to be hopeful of carrying Kennedy for
the first time and of regaining Dawson,
but both hopes seem insubstantial. The
end of the Riordan dynasty in Ken-
nedy should not produce a swing of
more than ten percent with the AWU
solidly behind the new candidate. Next
door Dr. Patterson has dug himself
into Dawson with textbook virtuosity;
sugar prices will have to get a great
deal better for Mr. Fordyce to toss him.
Liberal Hopes
On the figures the Liberals’ chances
in the electorates of Brisbane and Her-
bert are the Government’s best pros-
pects. Manfred Cross narrowly missed
a distribution of preferences in 1963,
and a swing of about three percent could
cost the ALP a seat it has held since
1931, but one cannot help feeling that
if Brisbane could be won the party
would have picked a stronger candidate.
Herbert, the north-coast seat dominated
by Townsville, is complicated by the
presence of the only DLP Queensland
candidate to break ten percent in 1963.
The Liberal candidate for Herbert is
their local organiser and a proven vote
Jim Killen
Alan Hulme
getter. A swing of two percent could
give the Liberals the seat, and there is
a fair chance of it occurring if boom-
ing Townsville opts out of the stag-
nant North.
Labor Hopes
On the other side of the hill four
Liberal seats in Brisbane are vulner-
able to very small swings to the ALP.
The most exciting contest is in Petrie
where Reg O’Brien is trying to eject
the Postmaster-General for the second
time. The complaints about an absent
member that dogged Mr. Hulme in
1961 and anti-Liberal sentiments in the
Country Party areas to the north of the
city boundary could hurt Mr. Hulme;
population growth in one of the largest
electorates in the State could help him
a little. .A swing of three percent could
put Mr. O’Brien in again, and it is
talked of as the most likely Labor gain
in Queensland.
Next to Petrie lies Lilley, where Labor
hopes ride on voting figures at the
recent State election which could mean
the swing of 3| percent needed to take


the seat from Mr. Kevin Cairns. Lilley
has provided the only excitement of
the campaign to date with party signs
thrown in the river and midnight
chases. Mr. Cairns is that rare Aus-
tralian phenomenon, the candidate who
has been promoted from a hopeless
seat to a marginal one; he could well
escape a general daft to Labor if it is
not too big.
Across the river Dr. Wylie Gibbs
holds Bowman by the narrowest margin
of the four seats. A swing of 1 \ percent
could return the 1961-63 member, Jack
Comber, yet few people expect this
to happen. Moreton is one of the fastest
growing and largest electorates in
Queensland though the biggest here
still have only half the enrolment of
Victorian giants like Bruce and Lalor.
The swing of five percent needed to
elect Mr. Keogh of the ALP could be
aided by a reduced DLP vote and
growth of working class areas, but un-
less the Government is in worse shape
-than appears at the moment Mr. Kil-
len should get back in ’66.
National party leaders are not ex-
pected to spend much time in Queens-
land. Each has a couple of meetings in
Brisbane and a couple in provincial
cities; Mr. McEwen will concentrate on
country centres. But in the main the
campaign so far has been carried by
the candidates, and they have generated
remarkably little excitement.
Territories
On all general criteria the Liberals
should win the A.C.T. For the first
time they are campaigning hard against
the Labor stalwart Jim Fraser who has
held the seat for 15 years.
Fraser has been tireless in his efforts
to ease the very personal problems of
the rapidly growing municipality, but
he is as parochial as any parish-pump
politician could ever be. Now that the
Canberra MP is to have full voting
rights, the people of the national capital
might be expected to want something
more than a devoted city alderman.
Sociology is on the side of the Lib-
erals. 15,000 of the 45,000 voters on
the roles are new to the area and many
are in Canberra as part of the defence
build-up or as a result of the burgeon-
ing of business and professional services.
So a majority of these might be ex-
pected to vote against Labor. The DLP
is a force for the first time, too, and
should draw at least 5000 votes from
the large Roman Catholic community.
And yet, Wilbur Rowell the Liberal
candidate does not impress as a force-
ful, dynamic character, and he has not
made much impact in the campaign.
Fraser has strenuously avoided identify-
ing himself with his party, presenting
himself as the dedicated, independent
servant of the local people. On that
basis he could just scrape back.
In the Northern Territory, a new
Labor candidate, Mr. R. C. Ward,
should have no trouble in keeping the
seat for the ALP against Mr. S. E.
Calder, Country Party.
W.A.—Land of the Ord
Much has been made in Western Australia over the Federal rejection of pro-
posals on the Ord, and it was felt that this might become a critical election issue
in the State. The fact that State parliamentarians were not given their usual week
off to campaign for the Federal candidates became front-page news, interpreted as
a rude gesture by the embittered State Premier, Mr. David Brand.
But it is doubtful that this has been
wielded well enough by the anti-
Government parties to make it a sig-
nificant election weapon. Labor, lack-
ing someone of Dr. Rex Patterson’s
ability and prestige to make it sting,
have missed a magnificent opportunity.
The most interesting Western Austra-
lian seat is Swan, held by Liberal Mr.
Dick Cleaver. Here Labor sees its best
chance of cashing in on any Ord
resentment vote, and they have been
campaigning hard with bright, almost
go-go publicity. Last election Cleaver
scored 52.9 percent of the votes only
after having picked up 2000 more of
the preferences than his Labor rival
Mr. Joe Berinson. The primary votes
went to Cleaver 23,547, Berinson
23,415.
Berinson, a chemist and member of
the ALP State executive, campaigned
extremely and it was a disappoint-
ment to his team when, for personal
reasons, he did not stand again this
year. But his successor, 37-year-old
estate agent Mr. Denis Gillett, has had
longer to campaign in an area growing
with what could be considered pre-
dominantly Labor voters, mostly young
marrieds in mushrooming new suburbs.
Gillett may have the kind of appeal in
this growing industrial area to wrench
votes from Cleaver, who is a strong
campaigner, well entrenched in the
electorate, particularly through social
welfare work.
The electorate of Stirling has every-
thing but the personalities to make for
a thriller. It has always been some-
thing of a toss-up between union secre-
tary and Labor Left-wing stalwart Mr.
Harry Webb and diminutive newsagent
Mr. Doug Cash for the Liberals. Webb
has held the seat (after losing it in
1958) by only 250 to 300 votes at the
last two elections. Last time he polled
29,806 primary votes against Cash’s
25,641, but had this lead whittled down
to a precarious 50.10 percent majority
after preferences had been counted. He
has by far the smallest majority of the
State’s Labor Members.
Cash this year has won himself some
publicity that may count on November
26 by bucking the Liberal Party, who
told him in mid-year either to give
up his studies for a BA degree with
politics major or lose their endorse-
ment. He pulled out, but offered him-
self again, still on his own terms. A
combination of strong backing from his
Stirling division and a big field of
relatively weak opponents gave him the
endorsement. So now he is campaign-
ing and preparing for his final exams
at the same time. Here, in what could
be one of Australia’s more colorful
seats, the two main contenders are long-
time rivals with too-familiar faces; it
is a rather lacklustre affair. The DLP
this year are contesting all seats,
backed by strong organisation, and
they are working most strongly in
Stirling, where old campaigner Mr.
Frank Pownall may give enough pre-
ferences to Cash to carry him through.
Labor’s tactics have been to upset the
status quo by switching their prefer-
ences from Country Party to Liberal.
With this, Corrigin farmer Mr. John
Hallett, the Country Party’s sitting
Member for Canning, would appear to
have little hope of re-election. Last elec-
tion he polled only 10,844 primary votes
of the 40,042 total against Liberal Mr.
Neil McNeill’s 17,000, but with 90
percent of the Labor preferences going
his way the final count gave him a
52.23 percent vote. McNeill moved into
the State’s Upper House, succeeded by
hardware-store owner Mr. Norm Snow,
campaigning for the first time. In the
12 months since his endorsement he
has combed the 35,000 square mile
electorate which takes in all but the
south-western corner of the State
*J»HE fourth swinging seat is Moore,
where at the last election Country
Party candidate Mr. Don Maisey
picked up 12,810 primaries behind his
Liberal opponent Mr. Vic Halbert’s
12,876, but again preferences changed
the picture and Maisey moved up to a
final figure of 21,847 to Halbert’s
15,985, giving him a 57.75 percent win.
This year it is a paradox that it is
important to Maisey that his Liberal
rival, Mr. Harold Lundy, should finish
behind their Labor opponent. Then dis-
tribution of Liberal preferences would
allow him to retain the seat; if Labor
preferences are distributed first Maisey
must lose.
Labor’s man for Moore is Mr. Mai
Brice, a schoolteacher in his 20s, who
is up against two men deeply involved
in the rural policy-making of the rural
area. However, Maisey has not made
the impact on Federal politics his sup-
porters hoped he might when they
elected him from his position as head
of the Farmers’ Union wheat section.
And Lundy, a youngish Cunderdin far-
mer, although perhaps not as strong a
candidate as Halbert, is taking the fight
to Maisey. As chairman of the Liberals’
State rural policy committee he is in a
position to get over the message that
his party, too, has something for the
farmers.
With the West’s current House of
Representatives strength of four
Liberals, three ALP, two Country Party
it appears the Liberals have a good
chance of picking up Canning, reason-
able chances of scoring in Moore and
Stirling, and about the same risk of
losing Swan.


The Last Hurrah
After Calwell the TV men
By ALAN REID
IF 70-year-old Arthur Augustus Cal-
well, that aging but indomitable
political warhorse, loses the Fed-
eral elections this month, he is pledged
to vacate the Federal Labor leadership.
But whether he wins or loses, the 26th
Federal Parliament which is to be
elected for a three vear term on Novem-
elected fora three-year term on INovem
ber 26 will almost certainly mark the
end of an era in political campaigning
- the era of the big-hall, mass-meetin|
demagogue, who could lift his audience
almost off their seats and win a loyalty
and a following that would take him
to the pinnacle of political leadership
and success. The change in campaign
techniques has been discernible for some
years now in fact, since the introduc-
tion of television. But the rate of change
is accelerating. Modernity has overtaken
the politician. The old-type demagogue
is now as outdated as the packsaddle is
in the outback since the advent of four-
wheel-drive vehicles. This is not to say
that demagoguery the appeal by the
popular leader to the prejudices (and
aspirations) of the masses is dead.
It will never die. Not while men have
votes and other men are striving for the
political power and control those votes
can give them. But the techniques for
the successful application of dema-
goguery (and I am using the word here
in the sense of the capacity of a man
to gain support for his viewpoint by an
appeal to the masses through the spoken
word) are no longer what they were.
Previously, a man got up on a plat-
form. He thundered, he declaimed, he
argued, he pleaded, he cajoled. The
setting of a crowded hall or a mass
meeting, with its overtones of emotion-
alism, was such that he could indulge
in grand opera on the most baroque
scale without the fear (if he were a
competent performer) that he might be
regarded as comical rather than, a
larger-than-life figure.
Now, through the medium of the
TV screen, he has to come into your
living-room. You are not part of the
mass, a unit in a packed audience.
You are probably relaxed, comfortable
in an armchair, with your seat no longer
numbed from contact with a hard
wooden bench. You do not want to be
ranted at. You have to be convinced.
The need for demagoguery still exists.
The man facing you on the screen still
wants your vote and your support
or acceptance of his viewpoint. But
it is a different kind of demagoguery.
It is TV demagoguery.
At the moment I cannot think of a
TV demagogue on the Government
side. They may have developed one
and it may be just that I have not
seen him in action. But Labor’s Dr. Jim
Cairns, MHR for Yarra, is an example
of a parliamentarian who has adapted
himself to the modern techniques.
I do not think it unfair to say that
in the flesh Cairns is capable of evoking
enormous hostility. He has strong views
on Australia’s role in Asia, particularly
the part it is playing in South-East
Asia, and these views run counter to
those held by the Government. A num-
ber of Government supporters, prob-
ably the majority, dislike him intensely
(politically) for these views. A number
of his own ALP colleagues disagree with
his views. When Cairns stands up to
speak in the Parliament you can feel
this dislike, almost a physical thing,
fill the chamber. This dislike of hia
views manifests itself on occasions at
some of his public meetings. He has
had some quite stormy audiences to
face. He reacts understandably ta
these often impassioned displays.
He becomes cutting, barbed, arro-
gantly confident of the correctness of
his viewpoint. But put him on TV and
he uses the medium intelligently and
with understanding of the techniques
it imposes. He is the essence of reason-
ableness controlled, poised, im-
peccably polite. Clean-featured and
with the trim figure of the ex-athlete
who has maintained pride in his fitness
long after he has moved from the active
sporting field, his attitude is one of
quiet confidence. He never raises his
voice nor loses his tight self-control.
For Cal well, 70 years of age in this
period of electronics, this is almost
certainly the final campaign flourish —
the farewell appearance of a man the
bulk of whose political life and cam-
paign techniques were shaped long be-
fore TV (and its side effect, rising
costs) changed the anatomy of political
campaigning in Australia.
Calwell is probably the best ex-
ample of the old-style campaigner
left in the Parliament. As far back as
1917 (when conscription was also the
issue) he was campaigning. Young,
scrawny, already bespectacled, his gin-
gery locks showing a stronger tinge of
red (there was a wonderful photograph
of that Calwell in military uniform
photographed in a pre-World I group,
with the also uniformed young Robert
Menzies, published in a Sydney news-
paper just before the 1963 elections),
Calwell cut his political teeth at the
open meetings of the anti-conscription
campaign.
He grew up in the Labor Party, a
hard nursery for that form of cam-
paigning. He learned what it was like
to hold an audience, not an audience
of individual TV viewers but the
massed audience of a sometimes appre-
ciative, sometimes hostile crowd.
This is not to suggest that Calwell’s
rise was due exclusively to his control
of his audience. A colossal reader, a
diligent and informed student of Aus-
tralian, British, and United States
history (he drew his interest in the
Llnited States from a grandfather who
moved from America to Australia dur-
ing goldrush days), Calwell, even as
a young man, was appreciative of the
seats of power and liked to be sitting
squarely on them. He was a fixer as
well as a firebrand.
He was president of the Victorian
ALP in 1931, and a power in the land
even then. He was officially a clerk
in the Victorian Treasury, with none
of the outward trappings of power. But

for a long .period in Victoria when the
Victorian Country Party was making
and unmaking official and unofficial
alliances with the Labor Party, the
Treasury clerk was the man summoned
by the Dunstan Country Party Govern-
ment for consultation as to what atti-
tude Labor proposed to take or not
take on the issues of the day. There
are those who claim that the Dunstan
Government never made a major de-
cision without first consulting their
relatively junior employee to find out
which way Labor proposed to jump.
Calwell entered the Federal Parlia-
ment on the death of Dr. Maloney, the
delicate-featured, sharp-bearded social-
istic Melbourne medico, who had a pas-
sion for securing adequate milk for
Australian schoolchildren, and who had
held the seat of Melbourne from 1904
until 1940. Calwell had waited a long
time for Dr. Maloney’s seat. He arrived
in the Parliament at an exciting period.
It was just a year almost to the day
before the fall in late 1941 of the Fad-
den Government—the last Federal
Government to be voted into extinc-
tion on the floor of the chamber of the
House of Representatives.
Labor was in government, on its
way up, and Calwell, with the reputa-
tion of years of successful political
manipulation and campaigning in Vic-
toria, expected to rise with it. He
didn’t. He went on the back benches
instead of into the Ministry he expected
to enter on his record. He did every-
thing he could to get himself off the
back benches. He worked like a dog
in the Party. He made speeches that
revealed his extraordinary range of
vocabulary (he still delights in the use
of the unusual word, and every check-
back I’ve made through a dictionary
has invariably shown that he uses it
in the most correct of senses). He
cultivated pressmen assiduously in the
hope that this would produce the
national publicity which he both craved
and believed he needed to further his
career.
It is from this period of his career
that you- can trace the almost obsessive
hatred he later had for the Press and
which was his hallmark until compara-
tively recent years. Up to that stage,
he had displayed no particular hostility
to the Press. He would mouth the
almost inevitable platitudes to which
Labor parliamentarians seemingly feel
themselves committed. Newspapers
were always “the Capitalistic Press.”
Newspapermen were invariably “hire-
lings of the Capitalistic Press.” But he
recognised the value of the publicity
they gave him, and he cheerfully used
both the Press and its employees.
But not getting the publicity from
them that he thought was his due, he
decided to change his tack. Whatever
the newspapers and newspapermen did,
they were not going to ignore him,
Arthur Calwell, the man who had run
the ALP machine in Victoria and told
successive State administrations where
they got off. Seemingly as a tactic, he
decided to make himself noticed by
attacking newspapers and newspaper-
men. He did so in the most colorful
and lurid of language—the type of
language for which his earlier train-
ing had fitted him and for which his
reading had given him a .magnificently
picturesque vocabulary.
The newspapers (and newspaper-
men), incensed, retaliated, and Calwell
achieved his objective. He was sky-
rocketed to national prominence. But
in the course of reaching that promin-
ence, what had started as a tactical ploy
became an obsession. • The seemingly
synthetic hate turned into a real hatred,
which lasted for years. Only irl recent
times has this abated, and it only needs
something to happen to which he ob-
jects for flashes of the old feeling to
come to the surface'
Calwell has taken part in every elec-
tion campaign since 1940, not as Prime
Minister Harold Holt has (sheltered
until.now during all those years behind
the giant figure of Robert Gordon
Menzies), nor even as Deputy Prime
Minister John McEwen has (protected
by the fact that as a Country Party
representative his interests were sec-
tional and regional), but in the full-
throated Labor way which demanded
that man should address as many mass
meetings as his throat and physical
powers could endure.
Last Flourish
;GOME of the haphazard “hit-or-miss”
campaigning methods of earlier
years had already gone before Calwell
succeeded 'the late Dr. Herbert Vere
Evatt in 1960. The first change came in
methods of transportation, the second
in methods of financing, as rising costs
made the necessity of a more scientific
aipproach to election campaign spending
increasingly urgent.
No longer do a group of pressmen,
cold, depressed, and tired, huddle on
some bleak railway station waiting for
a midnight train while John Curtin,
austerely aloof, cigarette-holder jutting,
coat collar turned up against the chill,
strolls up and down the deserted plat-
form talking campaign tactics with the
prince of Press Secretaries, Donald K.
Rodgers (now in charge of 2UW’s news
service), who was the invaluable and
valued political Man Friday to Curtin
and the late Ben Chifley, both in Op-
position and during their periods as
Prime Minister. Both pressmen and
campaigners now travel by plane. It is
the same old track from Perth to north-
ern Queensland and back. But now you
cover it in a more concentrated fashion,
faster, and with the eye of the TV
camera following inexorably.
Unsystematic as they are, the meth-
ods of financing are far more efficient
than previously. I can remember
Rodgers (who was quite careless about
the custody of his own money, but
punctiliously correct about handling
other people’s) asking me to act as
bodyguard while he wrapped up great
fistfuls of new, crisp tenners, more thair.
up to that stage I had ever seen in a
single collection, in brown paper
packets to take to the bank. It was a
contribution that some anonymous
donor had made to the Labor Party,
and he was allowed to make it (and
this, though it seems unbelievable, I
believe) only on condition that he made
the contribution with “no strings
attached.”
I am sure that I would have been
a most ineffectual bodyguard if the need
for one had seriously arisen, but Rodgers
and I got the rfioney safely to the bank
to disappear into the election cost maw
that was already becoming increasingly
rapacious. I am sure that this type of
anonymous donation .is still a factor in
campaign financing. But costs are chang-
ing the nature of Australian election
campaigns almost as much as TV. In
both the major parties Liberal and
Labor the State branches still
struggle to reserve for themselves part
of the spending money. They want to
spend it on developing local issues,
•which they consider are as important
in deciding the outcome in an indi-
vidual seat as national issues.
But the parties are reaching the stage
where elections sooner or later (and
my feeling is that it will be before the
1969 elections come round) will have
to be fought on national issues. The
State organisations will resist the move-
ment, but the economics of the situation
demand it. Federal ALP secretary Cyril
Wyndham has already said that it costs
$200,000 to run a worthwhile election
campaign. Actually he appears to be
stating the minimum on which the cen-
tral body of a party can operate if it is
to produce a 1 campaign that will have
some public effect. He produced a
scheme that would have financed an
election on a national basis. Some of
the States are suspicious of the scheme.
But events look as though they will,
in the long term, force acceptance if
not of this centralised scheme at least
of one which produces centralised con-
trol and campaigning on national issues
rather than parochial ones.
As I see it, this has to come. Other-
wise politics at the national level, where
costs are very high, will become the
prerogative of the wealthy, as indeed
it has tended to in the United States.
I know of two young members, one
Labor and the other Liberal, who have
mortgaged their homes to fight the
present campaign. Another man, a can-
didate, has sold his home to contest a
seat. A campaign conducted on nationaL
rather than local lines could save them
from taking such steps, which cannot be
in the interests of a democracy in which
all persons should have the opportunity
to offer themselves for public service
without making such sacrifice.
Galwell is a survivor from the great
days when a politician’s contact with
his audience was direct and not through
the medium of the TV set. The present
campaign is virtually the last flourish
of that generation. Whatever happens
on November 26, the contact from now
on will be increasingly through the TV
medium. The old style King Dema-
gogue is dying. The present election
campaign may prove to be his funeral
rites. The prince with the smooth TV
image seems his certain political heir.


The Widow’s Mite
Victoria’s Political Scroogery
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
. . Beware of the scribes which
love to go in long clothing and love
salutations in the market place . . .
which devour widows’ houses and for
a pretence make long prayers.”
The prayers in the Victorian Parlia-
ment are not so very long but the houses
and households of the State’s poorer
widows are constantly being devoured.
Fares rise, food and clothing be-
come more expensive, rents increase,
and the standard of living of most of
the community gets better, but widows
without private incomes who are un-
able to work suffer from the rising
costs and do not share in the increas-
ing affluence.
A recent decision of the Victorian
Cabinet to reduce assistance to widows
and their dependants therefore appears
to be an act of extreme meanness. The
annual Budget of the Victorian Govern-
ment is about $400,000,000 and the
cuts in assistance to widows will save
the State Treasury no more than $40,000
per year.
The State is able to save this .01
percent of future Budgets because the
Commonwealth Government has in-
creased its Social Service payments to
widows by $1 per week. The Chief
Secretary, Mr. Rylah, explained last
week that where State assistance to
widows was less than $1 per week such
assistance would cease, and where it
was greater than $1 per week it would
be reduced by $l. The raise is real
for those widows in more fortunate cir-
cumstances who do not qualify for State
Welfare Department aid, but the,re will
in fact be no raise in income for the
poorest. What one Government has
granted another has effectively taken
away.
It is worth tracing the background
to this act of political Scroogery and
explaining the Government’s arguments
of justification.
In the first place, most of the women
who receive assistance as widows are
not true widows. At present nearly 350
widows receive assistance from the Vic-
torian Social Welfare Department, and
less than 500 deserted wives receive
similar assistance and are classified as
widows. The Social Welfare Depart-
ment also assists about 500 women who
have been deserted for less than 6
months, and some 800 whose husbands
are ill, injured, unemployed, or in
jail.
The formula for State Welfare pay-
ments is based on an arbitrary “re-
quired income” figure set by the Gov-
ernment. The required income ranges
from $11.50 in the case of a widow
with one child to $22.50 in the case of
a widow with six children. The re-
quired inco.me is a net figure established
after certain deductions are made: up
to $l2 for rent and $2.50 for hire pur-
chase.
In the case of a widow with three
children, whose only income is $21.50
from Commonwealth Social Service
payments, deductions of, say, $lO for
rent and $2 for hire purchase com-
mitments, leaves a net income of $9.50.
The State Welfare Department may
then approve assistance to such a widow
of $6.90 to bring the required income
up to the standard fixed.
Mr. Rylah argues three points in
favor of his Government’s decision to
cut payments by $1:
• I’hat the increase of $1 granted to
widows by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment brings the widows that much
closer to the “required income” figure
fixed by the State Government and
therefore allows a corresponding de-
crease in State aid.
• That Social Service payments are
properly the business of the Common-
wealth and the State is straining both
its budget and its charity in entering
the field at all.
• That, in any case, Victoria’s assist-
ance scheme for widows is much better
than that of any other State.
JJOWEVER, only a couple of weeks
ago Mr. Rylah also said in the
Lower House: “I agree that the amount
they (widows and their dependants) re-
ceive is not enough and I should love to
be able to do a great deal more for
them.” It is surprising that his concern
did not take into account the following
facts:
(i) Whilst the relatively less indigent
widows on pensions have gained an
extra $1 the poorest widows have in
effect received no rise; i.e., those in most
need are the most disappointed.
(ii) Since September 1964, the con-
sumer price index in Victoria has risen
by $2.52. In that time widows’ pensions
have been raised $1.50 by the Common-
wealth Government, but the poorest
widows, receiving additional aid from
the State Government, have had their
aid cut by that amount. They have thus
received- nothing to offset the consumer
price index rise, whilst nearly all other
sections of the community have in-
creased their incomes. The poorest and
their fatherless children have suffered
the most.
(iii) Following this year’s Basic Wage
increase, fares, power and fuel, food,
clothing, and everyday domestic items
continue to rise in price but the poorest
of the State’s widows have gained noth-
ing with which to meet present and
future increases.
In the past four years the number
of widows receiving assistance has de-
creased despite price inflation and their
own increasing numbers. In 1962, for
example, 1103 widows and deserted
Arthur Rylah
wives classified as widows and 7413
of their children were receiving assist-
ance totalling about $BOO,OOO yearly.
At present the widows’ account is run-
ning a little over $550,000 for 824
widows and 6209 children.
The attitude of some Government
members is revealed in the following
extraordinary inversion of the famous
remark of Marie-Antoinette to the
starving French peasants, from Vic-
toria’s Hansard for October 25.
“Mr. Wilkes: . . . the woman’s total
weekly income is $24.30 and the
Government is now deducting from its
contribution 80 cents for the four
children . . . how does this unfortunate
woman live? The weekly groceries for
herself and four children consist of
41b. of sugar, 38 cents; fish fingers, 48
cents; T|- dozen eggs, 90 cents; 2 pac-
kets cake mix, 40 cents . . .
Mr. Borthwick: Cake mix?
Mr. Wilkes: The honorable member
for Scoresby thinks that cake mix is
extravagant.
Mr. Borthwick: I merely said “cake
mix?”
Mr. Rylah did quote in horrific jus-
tification of his Government that in a
case of one typical poor widow the
Victorian Government assisted to the
extent of $9.40 per week, whereas if
the woman were living in Tasmania
she would receive from the State
Government only $5 extra, in New
South Wales only $1.50, and in South
Australia nothing at all.
The niggardliness of those State
Governments merits its own condemna-
tion, but it is scarcely a defence for
the Government of Victoria that widows
might be worse strained, starved, and
humiliated somewhere else.

OVERSEAS
The Republican Comeback
THE 1966 “off-year” elections for Congressional seats, State Governorships, and
lesser political offices proved noteworthy on two counts —for the fresh retro-
spective light they threw on the 1964 Presidential campaign and as a
preview of things to come in 1968, when a revitalised Republican Party will contest
the party of Lyndon Johnson for the White House.
The unexpected extent of the Repub-
lican victory last week —a gain of three
seats in the Senate, forty-seven seats in
the House of Representatives and eight
Governorships added up to a sharp
political turn to the right for this
country, particularly in domestic affairs.
It also threw into bold relief the profiles
of at least five potential Republican
Presidential nominees for 1968. These
men, not necessarily in the order of
importance, are Ronald Reagan, the
new Governor of California; Nelson
Rockefeller, the re-elected Governor of
New York; Charles Percy, the new
Senator fro,m Illinois; George Romney,
the re-elected Governor of Michigan,
and Richard Nixon,' the former Vice-
President under Dwight Eisenhower.
Before dealing with these men—all
videogenic in the sense of projecting an
attractive masculine image, complete
with full head of hair, toothpaste—ad
smile and extended glad-hand one
must- pause for a moment to pay
tribute to the “forgotten man” of 1966,
Barry Goldwater, the Republican can-
didate of 1964.
The dreadful things Goldwater spoke
so bluntly about two years ago in the
San Francisco Cow Palace, to the dis-
may and disgust of most of his fellow
Americans, were raised again: the
“white backlash” against “crime in the
-streets” and other manifestations of the
Negro struggle for Civil Rights, the
reaction to race riots and the fear of
accelerated Negro demands, helped to
elect Republicans in California and
Illinois, and Democrats in Alabama and
elsewhere in the South. But in Mary-
land and Georgia, Republicans won
Governorships against racist Demo-
crats, and in Massachusetts the Negro
Edward Brooke was elected to the
Senate.
The most obvious beneficiary of the
“white backlash” was TV star Ronald
Reagan in California, where the riots
in the Watts area of Los Angeles, and
in the Hunter’s Point area of San Fran-
cisco have dramaticised the Negro ques-
tion in the past two years. Reagan,
Governor Reagan and wife—He just kept smiling.
Face of the World
Asia: Riots occurred in Allahabad
and New Delhi, where police later
arrested leaders of the conservative
Jan Sangh party. The Home Minister
resigned, the Defence Minister re-
placed him. Extensive crop failures
were reported, with threat of a huge
famine. Russia further reinforced her
borders with China. In Japan the
Sato Government, under fire for
corruption, promised Cabinet
changes. The Canada Cup golf,
played near Tokyo, was bigger news.
The American build-up in Vietnam
was to continue, but at a reduced
rate.
★ ★ ★
The Americas: In the Congres-
sional elections the Democrats kept
control of the House, but the Re-
publicans regained many seats.
Among Governors elected were
several potentially strong Republi-
can candidates for President. In
Texas, President Johnson entered
hospital for a pre-surgery examina-
tion and his scheduled operation was
postponed. The U.S. launched Lunar
Orbiter Two. Canada’s government
was refused Supply after a debate on
a proposal to amalgamate its three
fighting services. Brazil knocked the
U.S.A. team out of the Davis Cup.
Europe: The German Christian
Democrats chose Dr. Kiesinger, a
former Nazi, as their leader to re-
place Dr. Erhard. The Greek
Government was expected to fall as
Parliament resumed. In Eire, Sean
Lemass resigned and Jack Lynch
was elected Prime Minister. Floods
ravaged northern Italy, with $125
million damage to art treasures. In
Britain, a Lord Chancellor’s Law
Commission advocated divorce re-
form including divorce by consent.
Trade union leader Frank Cousins
resigned from Parliament. A Trident
aircraft made the world’s first fully
automatic landing in dense fog. In
Paris ten Cuban Ballet members
sought asylum.
★ ★ ★
Africa: The anniversary of UDI
was celebrated in Rhodesia and Mr.
Smith said it would not become a
Republic unless Britain referred its
dispute to the U.N. for action. But
60 British Labor M.P.s demanded
majority rule in Rhodesia within 10
years. Organisation of African Unity
nations met in Ethiopia and decided
on guerilla raids against Rhodesia to
force Britain’s hand. Before the meet-
ing, Ghana detained Guinea’s 19
delegates, and Guinea accused the
American CIA of influencing this
move, and expelled U.S. Peace Corps
members.

ATLANTIC TRAVELLER’S
NOTEBOOK
I had a five-day romance
on the Atlantic
It was on the Queen Elizabeth. I was
travelling from New York to Le Havre.
It was no ordinary romance. This one
was with my cabin steward. Of course
he was oblivious, because he was just
doing his job. But that’s what I fell in
love with ... the service. Life on land
will never be the same again. He was
telling me he was the fourth generation
to -serve on the Queens. Being a good
steward is his life’s ambition. He knew
his job and was proud to do it. It was
a family tradition.
There are twelve hundred people in all
to look after you on each of the giant
Queens. Three quarters of the Cunard
stewards descend from seafaring
families.
Cunard buys more caviar than anybody
else in the world. It’s part of the plan-
ning that goes into the epicurean menus
which include such dishes as Supreme
of game hen Rembrandt, cold boiled
Maine lobster and split Bordeaux
pigeon.
The Cunard people like to make this
claim: "There are ten captains on the
bridge of a Queen." Ten officers
assigned to bridge duty held master's
certificates. Each one is fully qualified
to command a vessel at sea.
r
If you have business (or pleasure) on
either side of the Atlantic, take a five
day sea-break on one of the giant Cunard
Queens. Your First Class fare need
cost no more than a First Class jet fare.
Getting there is half the fun.
CUNARD
CONSULT YOUR LOCAL TRAVEL AGENT, ca
who lacks political experience but
possesses more than his share of the
aforementioned videogenic magic, rode
a one-million vote plurality into the
Governor’s chair, displacing plodding
Pat Brown, who lacks visual appeal
but had done a commendable job in
running the State for the previous
eight years. California is the State
which had previously elected a cinema
song-and-dance man, George Murphy,
to the Senate, so Reagan’s election was
not so bizarre as it would have seemed
in a more mature community. Cali-
fornia attracts a thousand migrants a
day, not all of them noteworthy for
intelligence, industry, or the other
virtues of good citizenship. Many of
them, to be brutally frank, are kooks,
oddballs, and misfits. But all over
age 21 have votes. And the votes of
the largest State in the Union are
going to talk loudly at the next Re-
publican nominating convention. If
Reagan proves to be an acceptable
State Governor he is certain to be a
Republican prospect for the Presidency
in 1968.
Nelson Rockefeller received an un-
expected reprieve from virtual political
demise when he rebuffed the threat of
Democrat Frank O’Connor —who was
assisted strongly by glamor-boy Bobby
Kennedy—to retain his post as Gover-
nor of New York State (and win about
40 percent of the vote in Harlem).
Had Rockefeller been beaten—as most
pollsters predicted—he probably would
never have run for political office again.
He has been a capable, honest, and
reasonably progressive Governor for
the past eight years. However, Rocke-
feller had the audacity, while in office,
to divorce a wife of long-standing to
take as a second wife the divorced
mate of a friend of long-standing. This
domestic upheaval was generally re-
garded as the principal reason why he
lost the Republican nomination in 1964
to Barry Goldwater. It was supposed
to ruin him, politically speaking, for-
ever. However, the voters of New York
State overlooked Rockefeller’s marital
situation last week and returned him
to office with a comfortable margin.
If New Yorkers can be that broad-
minded, the political bosses are now
asking, why can’t the voters in the
vast hinterland beyond the Hudson
River? Rockefeller has steadfastly
pronounced himself not interested in
another try for the White House. In
the light of his recent victory, how-
ever, these pronouncements sound
hollow. He must be counted among
the Republican moderates eligible for
Presidential nomination in 1968.
Charles Percy, who defeated a Demo-
cratic stalwart and avid Johnson parti-
san, Senator Paul Douglas (once his
Economics Professor at the University
of Chicago) in Illinois, has all the
attributes for high political office in
this country. Youthful and rich he
retired from the presidency of Bell
and Howell camera company at 47
Percy is also handsome, attractive to
both men and women, and holds a
position to the right of centre on Civil
Rights, particularly Negro housing,
which he wants contained in its present
areas. Percy’s greatest strength in the
recent balloting proved to be in the out-
skirts of Chicago, principally A 1
Capone’s old stamping ground in
Cicero, where the entrenched whites
are bitterly resisting Negro infiltration
of their neighborhood. Percy was also
helped to some extent by public sym-
pathy arising from the brutal murder,
still unsolved, of his pretty 21-year-old
daughter Valerie, who was also his
political aide, during the Senatorial
campaign. Although , outspoken on the
Negro question, Percy was dove-like on
Vietnam, calling for peace negotiations
and an early settlement, whereas
Senator Douglas echoed the hawkish
Johnsonian line.
Nixon
ANOTHER midwesterner whose
triumph placed him in the front
ranks of Presidential hopefuls was
ebullient George Ro.mney, the former
president of the American Motor Com-
pany (Rambler .motor cars), who swept
back into office as Governor of Michi-
gan. An active Morman and a zealous
physical culturist, Governor Romney
is a moderate on the race issue and on
Vietnam. His enormous vote-getting
ability in a State which is militantly
pro-labor and has a disproportionately
large Negro population marked him as
middle-of-the-road prospect who could
emerge if the Right and Left Wingers
of the Republicans come to bitter strife
—as well they might—in 1968.
And then there is Richard Nixon.
Despite his defeat for the Presidency by
John Kennedy in 1960 and his subse-
quent defeat for Governor of Cali-
fornia. The former Vice President
retains a strong hold on the Republican
movers and shakers notably the
Eastern banking and financial clique.
Nixon’s recent 30-day tour of the
country, speaking on behalf of Re-
publican candidates from coast to coast,
endeared him to all the winners. In
the absence of anyone stronger, Nixon
is regarded as titular head of the Re-
publican Party. As such he will have a
powerful voice in the 1968 nominating
convention and might even turn out to
be its standard-bearer.
As a man who places great store by
“rule by consensus” Johnson must have
been shocked by the strong Republican
uprising against his Administration. He
must realise, too, that he faces a real
struggle to remain in the White House
in 1968, particularly if things go badly
awry in Vietnam or on the home front.
Meanwhile the President still retains
majorities- of 248 seats to 187 in the
House and 64 to 36 in the Senate,
which should be sufficient to ensure

GENERAL MOSHE DAYAN asks
Can the Viet Cong Win?
In the second of three articles, General Dayan, former Chief of Staff of the Israeli
Defence Forces and today a prominent politician in Israel, gives a realist’s answer
to a basic question.
THE clearest and most extreme defi-
nition of American war aims I
heard in Vietnam came from
Lieut.-General Larsen, commanding the
First Field Force there. In his view
it is not enough for the Viet Cong to
be defeated in the field. Even if Ho
Chi Minh stops fighting and withdraws
his units from the South, the Ameri-
cans should continue to bomb North
Vietnam.
“What is required,” he said, “is for
Ho Chi Minh to sign an undertaking
recognising the 17 th parallel as the
frontier. He must give his written guar-
antee, in a formal agreement formally
ratified, that his forces will not cross
the frontier and that his Government
will not interfere in the affairs of the
South. Nothing less will solve the prob-
lem, and we must continue to put pres-
sure on the North, to bomb them day
and night, until they agree.”
I first heard of Larsen from General
Johnson, the United States Army Chief
of Staff, who was on one of his periodic
visits to Vietnam, when we met at
Pleiku. He said that among the top
generals there were different approaches
to the methods of warfare here. Some
favored “sitting” the more static
approach. The Ist Cavalry, on the other
hand, preferred “flitting,” favoring mo-
bility. Some commanders are conserva-
tive. Some, like General Larsen, are
aggressive. “You should meet him,” said
General Johnson, “and hear his phil-
osophy of the Vietnam War.”
S 0 presented myself at the General’s
HQ. I had come, I said, to hear
his views, and I was also anxious to see
his units, the 101st Airborne Division
and the Special Forces, in action. He
was frank, extremely lucid, and forth-
right. The outcome of the Vietnam war
would determine the fate of the whole
region, whether it went Communist or
became Western-orientated. The United
States made a mistake when, after
World War 11, she supported France
and Holland in their desire to resume
their colonial rule in Indo-China and
Indonesia. America did not wish to deny
independence to the countries of Asia,
nor did she seek to exploit them. Her
purpose was to erect a dam against
Communism, which tries to impose its
hegemony by force. The Vietnam war
was complex, unique in character, and
likely to last a long time; but the
Americans would stick to their aim until
victory.
The Viet Cong cadres were highly
motivated idealists. The previous week,
said General Larsen, a Viet Cong
sergeant, who had been taken prisoner,
was brought into him. He was very •
young, with a fresh, open countenance.
Larsen asked him two questions: was
he recruited to the Viet Cong by force,
or did he volunteer? Volunteered, was
his reply. Did he fall prisoner against
his will, or did he surrender? Against
his will, he replied. If he were able he
would escape and fight on. “Such men
are treasures to any Army,” said Lar-
sen.
But despite their men’s high morale,
the Viet Cong Army is getting weaker
and weaker. The units now arriving
from the North are not as good as their
predecessors. They are having a diffi-
cult time. Some of them fight bare-
foot. No boots, no sandals, not enough
food; malaria takes its toll. The long
march, the poor food, the sickness, and
the continual bombing of the Ho Chi
Minh trail drain their strength.
Hanoi, too, will break. Larsen remem-
bers the faces of the Germans and the
Japanese at the moment of their sur-
render. They were scared, broken.
Human beings crack under the pressure
of bombing that goes on day and night,
day and night, for years. They collapse
and give in. The next day I set out
with a platoon of 27 men on a patrol
that was to have lasted three days; but
we captured some prisoners, and we
also had some mishaps, so we returned
earlier than planned. According to the
original plan, we should have reached
on the first day a point where two
tracks crossed a large stream, and there
we were to have mounted an ambush.
Viet Cong troops encamped in the
jungle usually go down to the river
before dusk or in the early morning to
fill up with water, to wash, and to
clean their clothes.
Soon after we set off from the land-
ing zone to which we had been flown,
we apparently took a wrong track. But
the patrol commander, a captain from
the divisional reconnaissance unit, dis-
covered the error only after about an
hour’s march, when he noticed that the
path turned north of the required dir-
ection. We looked for some way of get-
ting through to the right path, but the
vegetation was so dense and inter-
twined that it was impossible to nego-
tiate without lengthy backing. Short of
going back, the only course was to con-
tinue along the path we were on, and
after hitting the stream to move south.
It was very slow going indeed. From
time to time we had to crawl under or
climb over boughs, bamboo branches,
and creepers which covered the track.
Throughout the entire march I was
never without the feeling that at any
moment we might find ourselves under
fire from somewhere within the en-
closing jungle, “threading” us all with
a single burst.
The track seemed like a narrow
tunnel hewn out of the vegetation. The
range of visibility was three or four
paces at most. Nor did the effort of
listening for the rustle of suspicious
movements seem worth while. The
ground was covered by a thick layer
of leaves and rotting plants which ab-
sorbed the sound of steps. There
was no trace of birds whose alarm calls
might have given warning of approach-
ing trespassers. Apart from red ants
with prodigious stinging powers, I saw
no sign of living things. Perhaps re-
peated bombing had frightened away
all wildlife.
noon we had reached the stream,
about a mile and a half north of
our target. We turned south. At first we
tried to walk along the water’s edge.
But the bank was steep and slippery
from continuous rain. We kept
stumbling and reaching out for a branch
to recover our balance, but this set up
an explosive crackle which we feared
would give us away. We therefore
looked for a path parallel to the
stream, and we found one a short dis-
tance away.
This was a good path, easy for
walking, and it bore signs of having
recently been used. At first we noticed
nothing special, except that boughs had
been freshly lopped off to make the go-
ing easier. But as we went farther, we
came across sharp bamboo pegs, pungi,
set at an angle to catch the feet, and,
just beyond, two booby traps. There
were grenades (American) with the
firing-pin removed wedged into holes
in the ground and covered by leaves
and grass. Fortunately the mines were
not properly camouflaged and they were
spotted by our scouts.
The patrol commander decided to
detonate the mines, even though the
noise might reveal our presence. He
feared that if we stepped off the track
to get round the obstruction we might
encounter other mines. It was now get-
ting late, and it was evident that we
would not reach our destination in time
to set up an ambush while it was still
light. We had no alternative but to
pick a site nearby and lie up for the
night. On the hill on the other side of
the stream we saw a sparsely covered
patch of ground, probably an aband-

oned field where rice or bananas had
once been grown, which was now being
reclaimed by the jungle. In the last
minutes of daylight we crossed the
stream, the water up to our necks, each
man holding on to his neighbor. By the
time we reached our sleeping patch
the darkness was complete.
The men of the patrol were very
tense, and I no less than they. The
physical effort of negotiating the tor-
tuous tracks; the wet clothes (moving
in the jungle you are always wet from
the sweat and the rain and the combina-
tion of the two and now we were
also wet from the stream); and above
all not knowing what might be lurking
behind each bush all this was ex-
hausting. The spot we had picked for
the night did not dominate the sur-
roundings, The exploding mines and
the noise we had made crossing the
stream must have revealed our posi-
tion.
The commander arranged his men in
a semi-circle, their backs to the stream,
their faces to the jungle, and ordered
them to dig in. He then told his firing-
officer to call for artillery fire on the
hilltop above us. If the Viet Cong were
there they should be hit. If they were
not, the shelling would keep them away.
The first shells landed wide because
the location had not been accurately
given, but after a few corrections they
dropped just where they were wanted,
on the top of the hill. Even though
the explosions shook the jungle, the
arrival of the artillery eased our tense-
ness. The feeling of being helpless and
cut off vanished. We were linked to
base. They now knew our exact loca-
tion. If we were attacked, we would
immediately receive air and artillery
support, and we were already protected
by a ring of shelling which systematic-
ally and steadily ploughed up the sur-
rounding heights.
The patrol commander, ginger-haired
and moustachioed (a Palmach or Israeli
commando-type from our war of in-
dependence days, doing everything him-
self detonating mines, directing the
artillery, going off to scout for a good
river crossing), now spread his poncho
next to me and prepared supper by
opening a can of C rations. We would
not expose ourselves by lighting a fire,
so we ate the meat cold. But in com-
pensation he regaled me with a raw
onion which his wife had sent to him
by post. (“Sweetest letter I got from
her!”) For dessert there was home-
made chocolate: we tipped some drops
from a water-bottle into a nylon packet
of sweetened cocoa, enough for six hot
cups, mixed it with our fingers, and the
“chocolate,” sweet and sticky, was
ready.
Toward midnight the downpour be-
came heavier, and to get away from the
mud I flung myself, wrapped and
bundled in a poncho, upon a bush,
while trying to ignore the jabs of the
obtrusive branches. Despite the shelling
and the 852 bombing, there was an all-
pervasive calm about the jungle. The
raindrops hit the leaves with a
monotonous beat, and from the stream
below came the relaxing sound of flow-
ing water.
It grew light at 0600, and we got
ourselves organised. Before moving off,
the commander contacted the base and
requested air observation. At 0630 two
reconnaissance helicopters arrived
(8-13 s, with perspex cabins, two men in
each). They circled above us for a few
minutes, decided with our commander
on the route we would follow, and then
flew off low, southwards. We started
walking, but even before we reached
the path we heard the crack of rifles
and the rattle of machine-guns, and
the helicopters informed us that they
had spotted Viet Cong troops near the
site where the paths cross the river.
Our firing officer wanted to sum-
mon artillery to shell the Viet Cong
unit, but one of the pilots asked him
to wait while he went to find out
“what’s going on there.” One aircraft
flew high and the other low so low
that it seemed to be weaving among the
trees. After a few minutes, the low-
flying pilot, a major, informed us that
the Viet Cong had stopped firing and
six of them were lying in a bunch near
a clump of trees. He thought they could
be taken prisoner and he urged us to
hurry on while he in the meantime kept
them pinned by fire.
Reaching the vicinity of the Viet
Cong group took us more than three-
quarters of an hour. The helicopters
almost ran out of fuel. From time to
time we heard machine-gun bursts from
the helicopters, who opened fire when-
ever their quarry fried to slip away. As
we approached the Viet Cong site we
were guided by the pilot, rather like
a mother shepherding her brood across
the busy road: “Watch out in the bushes
to your right. Give them a burst.”
“Scatter.” “Not so close to the water —
I think I saw a couple of black pyjamas
(Viet Cong dress).” “Now I’ll fly in
low and you jump forward. To the trees.
Ready? Okay Go!”
The helicopter dived, both machine-
guns firing on the ground, and the
patrol charged forward. The Viet Cong
rose from the grass and lifted their
hands. There were six altogether. One

lay with a thigh wound and one was
sick. The other four had two rifles and
a sub-machine-gun between them. The
wounded man, a sergeant, was in charge
of the group. He explained through our
South Vietnamese officer-interpreter
that the rest of the unit had left the
area last night, when the shelling began,
but this group remained, unable to
move at night because of the sick man
and his own wound. They had hoped to
find a hiding place and in two or three
days, when all was quiet again, to
rejoin their unit.
The story sounded feasible. Ques-
tioned about the direction their unit
had taken, they replied that they did not
know. Nor were they able or willing to
explain how they expected to find their
unit when the danger was over. They
looked weak, but not helpless, and their
weapons were clean and oiled. Our
medical aide undid the bandage of the
wounded man to rebandage him and
said he thought the wound was a few
days old and seemed to have been
caused by a shell or bomb-splinter.
They carried no documents, or, if they
had, they had managed to destroy or
hide them.
The unit to which the prisoners be-
longed had encamped above the stream.
The first thing we came across was the
kitchen, a row of ovens dug into the
ground. What was special about them
was their chimneys. To stop the smoke
from rising and giving away their posi-
tion, horizontal chimneys, narrow
channels, led from the sides of the
stoves and at the other end were split
into several pipes, thus scattering the
smoke. In the base of the stoves we
found remnants of still-hot embers be-
neath a layer of rain-drenched ashes.
Their bunkers and firing-posts were
dispersed among the trees and bushes
and well camouflaged. They were im-
possible to detect from the air or from
the front. Nor was there any sign of
digging or of freshly dumped earth.
The bunker was entered through a
burrow whose opening was hidden by
grass. Men of the patrol wanted to go
in and search the bunkers, but the com-
mander stopped them. He thought he
heard voices in the forest. The platoon
took up positions, and two scouts crept
carefully up the climbing path.
They noticed nothing suspicious and
signalled for the platoon to advance;
but as soon as we rose there was a
shout, “There they are. Fire!” It came
from one of our lookouts, who saw two
Viet Cong moving among the bushes on
our left. I do not know who opened
fire first, they or the patrol, but in a
moment the jungle was alive with the
noise of explosions and bursts of
machine-guns. Fire from the Viet Cong
came from our left: They were quite
close. Because of the thick foliage it
was impossible to fling grenades, and the
most effective fire was from the auto-
matic weapons. The exchange lasted
about a quarter of an hour.
At first I thought we would be
stormed by the Viet Cong unit, but they
did not advance. They may have been
covering the withdrawal of their food
or ammunition from the area. Our fir-
ing officer called for artillery support
and directed it on to the Viet Cong
posts. The shelling did its job. Soon
after the first bursts the Viet Cong fire
ceased.
Our patrol commander ordered his
men back to the stream. We had two
wounded, one badly with a bullet in
his face. Base signalled that helicopters
would pick us up at a landing zone 400
yards east of where we were. The
march there with the prisoners and
wounded took us more than an hour.
When we reached the LZ, we sent up
a yellow smoke bomb and six hovering
helicopters landed two by two, took the
wounded straight to hospital and the
platoon and prisoners to the CIDG
(Civilian Irregulars Defence Group)
camp.
I stayed the night at the CIDG camp.
There were 12 Americans and some 300
locally recruited Vietnamese. These
were Montagnards, a diverse unit rang-
ing in age from 14 to 70. Drawn up on
morning parade they make a rousing
sight! I had asked to spend the night
there when I learned that the American
intelligence sergeant would be carrying
out the first interrogation of the pris-
oners captured by the patrol. I was
anxious to be present and find out at
first hand something of the Viet Cong
Army. The interrogation took place
in the clubhouse next to the dining-
room. The prisoner, the wounded Viet
Cong sergeant, sat on a straw chair.
Across the table from him sat the
American sergeant, with the Vietnamese
interpreter between them.
rfHE interpreter’s English was very
poor. Even when the prisoner-
sergeant gave what was obviously a de-
tailed explanation, the interpreter chose
to precis it in “basic English.” When I
joined them, the interrogation had
reached a crisis. The prisoner had
stopped answering. Earlier he had re-
plied to the questions, mainly of a
technical nature, but when the inter-
rogator started tackling him on general
issues he “froze” and uttered not a
word.
In the exchanges that had taken place
before my arrival, he had given the
following facts: Age, 20. He joined the
Army 2\ years ago, and came from a
village where his father had been a
tenant farmer. With agrarian reform
and confiscation of landowners’ estates
and distribution of the land to those
who worked it, he had received his own
plot of half a mau (about 1J acres) and
was now a member of the co-operative.
The family’s economic position had im-
proved, thanks to the reform. The pris-
oner was not a conscript, he had volun-
teered for the Army. Young men who
did not volunteer were taken on a 16-
day ideological course, where they
heard explanations of their duty to join
the Army and fight for the liberation
of the South.
At the end of the course they were

asked collectively if they were ready
to volunteer, and none dared refuse.
After he joined he had been sent on a
leader’s course, completed his military
training, and served two years in~tfie
North. Five months ago his unit had
got orders to leave for the South. The
first stage of the journey was by train,
from Thoung Tin station to Dolen in
the province of Than-Hoa. There they
continued on foot. They walked to
Quany Binh, crossed the border into
Laos, and continued southwards,
through Laos and Cambodia, into South
Vietnam.
He had been in this area for weeks,
and had taken part in two engagements,
one in which his unit attacked a for-
ward post of the Vietnam Army, and
the second when they ambushed a mili-
tary convoy on Route 19. In the attack
on the South Vietnamese they had suf-
fered eight killed and 12 wounded, but
had succeeded in capturing the post, a
village militia station, and seizing five
machine-guns, 60 rifles, ammunition,
and radio transmitters. In the ambush
they had had to retire hurriedly, as
planes came to the help of the convoy
and bombed the area.
The prisoner sat in his chair, out-
wardly unperturbed. I thought he was
continuing his silence-strike, but he
suddenly looked up and said to his in-
terrogator: “But our soldiers know that
in Hanoi everyone gets the same ration.
They divide, equally, what there is.
There are no rich and poor.” The
American, seeing that the prisoner could
be drawn into an argument, said: “The

This is a new way to type. A typewriter
without type bars, without a moving car-
riage. Brilliantly replaced by an ingeni-
ous little printing element: a typeball
that dances across the paper, typing
each character with incredible speed. As
you watch it in action, you’ll notice how
it hugs the paper, never more than a
fraction of an inch away. Naturally it
types much faster than conventional
type bars which must travel several
inches to reach paper.
The new IBM 72 Electric not only has
a higher speed limit. Its ability to
“remember”* gives it a built-in rhythm
which actually helps secretaries im-
prove their typing speed.
Want to change type styles? Just
remove one typeball, click another into

The IBM 72 Electric is an amazing

French fought against your Govern-
ment. They denied you independence
and so the whole nation rose up against
them. But we are helping the Govern-
ment of Vietnam, the Saigon Govern-
ment, and we wish neither to conquer
you nor exploit you.”
This line was familiar to the Viet
Cong prisoner, and he had his answer
pat. “The Americans are imperialists
and neocolonialists (he used the French
pronunciation) and General Ky and
his clique are traitors and not a Govern-
ment. They are your servants, bought
by you. You are here like the French
—to enslave us, to turn Vietnam into
your military base and colony.”
The interrogator asked for more
coffee to be brought. In the dining-
room a huge pot of coffee stands on
the fire day and night. The pain of
the wound, the shock of capture, and a
general weariness weighed heavily on
the Viet Cong prisoner, and it was evi-
dent that in hurling his sharp answers
at the American sergeant he had found
some release from his emotional pres-
sures. He drank his coffee in great
gulps and sweat poured from him.
'J'HE American sergeant then ques-
tioned the prisoner about deserters
from his unit. Yes, there were some
deserters, but not because they went
over to the Government and American
side. It was because they had broken.
They did not have the stamina to con-
tinue fighting under the difficult condi-
tions. They were good soldiers, but
weak. They had broken. I do not know
what prompted the interrogator to do
so, but he reacted to this with sneering
contempt. “And you want me to believe
such tales? They deserted because of our
shells. They were scared of the bomb-
ing. They knew that if they went on
fighting against us they’d get killed in
a bombardment. You can’t fight
planes with rifles. Your soldiers know
this. They’re all afraid of the air
bombing and they want the war to stop.
Only your leaders, Giap and Ho Chi
Minh, who are far from the front at
home in Hanoi —don’t care. It’s they
who don’t want to stop the war.”
When the interpreter had finished
translating, the wounded prisoner
leaned on the table and said to him:
“Tell the American that this is not true.
We are not scared. They, the Ameri-
cans, are scared—scared to be here be-
cause they’re scared to die. We are not
afraid to fight, and we are not afraid
to die. This is our country and our
war.” He then turned to the American
interrogator, looked him straight in the
eye, and spat in his face. In an even
voice, he said: “Now you can kill me.
I’m not afraid. It’s you who are
afraid.”
There is no doubt that the Viet Cong
cadres are not only “highly motivated”
and indoctrinated with the Communist
outlook, but they are also sincere ideal-
ists and patriots, at times fanatically so.
They are fighting for three aims, which
are really one: driving the Americans
from Vietnam, toppling the Saigon Gov-
ernment and establishing a Communist
regime, and uniting the North and
S° ut h-
Have they any chance of succeeding?
Can they defeat the Americans? As
things are going now—no. Their mili-
tary achievements are not on the up-
swing; they are steadily declining. The
situation today is not only different
from what it was 12 years ago when
they fought the French but also from
what it was one year ago. And their
frontal attacks on the American Army
or even on Vietnamese units who re-
ceive close support of American artil-
jery, armor, and aircraft are doomed
in most cases to failure.
The basic concept of General Giap,
the top Viet Cong military commander,
as expressed in his writings, is over-
generalised. The superiority of “man
against the gun” depends not only on
the man but also on the gun. The
Americans in 1966 have infinitely
more guns than the French possessed
in 1954, and they are much better. And
not only guns: they have also planes
and helicopters and tanks and equip-
ment and ammunition and money. The
victory of “the man over the gun” in
1954 is not likely to be repeated in
1966, when against the man are ranged
many guns and much else.
So I do not think the Viet Cong can
inflict defeat on the American Army in
the way they did on the French. They
cannot annihilate the Americans, they
cannot bring about their surrender, nor
drive them from Vietnam, nor weaken
their strength. But they may, in my
view, be able to prevent the Americans
from gaining their purpose,
Hanoi can, if she can be stubborn
and refuse to come to the negotiating
table, refuse to sign a guarantee or any
other arrangement whereby she recog-
nises the divisions of Vietnam and the
Americans as a party to the arrange-
ment. The Viet Cong can —if it
refrains from pitting their regular units
against regular units in frontal engage-
ments and organises guerilla warfare
prevent the Americans and the
Saigon Government from pacifying the
country. The Viet Cong cannot drive
out the Americans, but they can, by
adopting appropriate methods of war-
fare, avoid being driven out themselves
from the South. They can deny the
normalisation of life there, the use of
r oads, the establishment of ordered ad-
ministration, the normal functioning of
the country.
But to do this the Viet Cong must
decide not only on changes in their
organisation and in their methods of
combat. They must, first of all, recog-
nise that in the present conditions they
have no power to achieve their longed-
f°r aim the removal of the Ameri-
cans. All they are able to gain now is
n °t a Viet Cong victory but the inhibi-
tion of American aims,
NEXT: If the Viet Cong can’t win, can
the Americans?


ONE MORE
WEEK
Open Air
THE DROUGHT-BREAKING, dam-
filling rain which rained on Daphne
Guinness for her day at Paddington with
the Art Gallery Society (page 42) and
on Elwyn Lynn when he went to the
preview of the Transfield Sculpture Ex-
hibition in Sydney’s Hyde Park (page
47) was still falling at the official open-
ing of the exhibition by the Lord
Mayor, Alderman Armstrong, 24 hours
later.
However, the public relations officer
of Transfield, Mr. Ernest Marty, told
us that the opening was very “cosy,”
although the pavilion, specially put up
for the exhibition, is only partly roofed
and walled. People huddled together to
keep the rain out of their champagne
and off their clothes, and so got along
very well indeed.
Permission to put up a pavilion in
Hyde Park was not, of course, given to
Transfield, a construction company,
but to the Sculptors’ Society. The
pavilion, designed by Adrian Knapp
and built by George Hudson at cost is
35 squares, about twice the size of the
average house. When the exhibition
finishes, on December 7, the pavilion
will be dismantled and re-erected at
Seven Hills, an outer suburb, where the
fir,m has its main workshop. There it
will be used, according to Mr. Marty, as
an “entertainment area.”
Some of the 38 pieces of sculpture
have spread out of the pavilion into the
surrounding park where they look very
handsome. The pavilion incorporates a
1913 sundial (Motto: “I mark the fyour,
dost thou?”) which probably hasn’t had
so much attention since 1913. Sculpture
in the rain has created another prob-
lem for Mr. Marty. Some of the pieces
are already acquiring a coating of rust,
which, in some cases, is just what the
artist wanted, but in other cases, does
not fit in with the artist’s conception.
So Mr. Marty has had to invest in a
pressure-pack can of anti-rust.
The pavilion is guarded 24 hours a
day, not because the organisers fear that
pieces of sculpture would be stolen
some of them are heavy enough to defy
any thief. The light fittings which
illuminate the pieces during the early
hours of the evening and other pieces
of equipment seemed a more likely
target. However, the guards have found
themselves selling the 50-cent catalogue
to visitors at literally every hour of the
day and night.
Speaking Up
A PROFOUND STUDY of the flat
tones of the Australian voice is not
everyone’s idea of thrilling research, but
to Professor A. Delbridge, of Mac-
quarie University, already surrounded
by thousands of tapes, the $2lOO grant
he has just received from the Com-
monwealth will open the way to the
excitement of using laboratory tech-
niques and analytical instruments to
gauge the acoustic information he needs
to find out what are “the norms and
patterns of Australian English.”
He feels the research has a sound
education justification because it is only
through the schools that the great mass
of voices can be reached and perhaps
improved.
However, the suggestion of improve-
ment is a point of confusion for him
because he cannot concede that any one
voice is really uglier than another.
“Any range of sounds should be accept-
able, as long as the message is pre-
sented effectively.” Asked if he really
felt this way when listening to the
twang of the worst Australian voice,
he said: “I keep telling myself I do,
anyway.”
Determined not to be a snob, Del-
bridge, a youthful forty-five, himself
a product of the N.S.W. education sys-
tem and Sydney University, with two
years in London behind him, has a
pleasantly cultured voice, but insists: “I
speak Australian.”
He also insists that it is a mistake
to try to force a cultivated voice on to
a personality. He would prefer to
leave the Australian girl, who is often
declared perfect until she opens her
mouth, just as she is. “Why not? That
is her voice.”
Nowhere in the world, according to
Professor Delbridge, is English spoken
perfectly, certainly not in England,
where every few miles another dialect
pops up and where the U and non U
conversation brands the individual. “So
we have no guide,-no yardstick by which
to devalue the Australian voice.”
In fact, he would like to have an
Australian English dictionary published,
so that we do not have to abide by the
arbitrary decisions of England’s Oxford
or America’s Webster’s for pronuncia-
tion.
His interest in sound as such stems
from a love of music. He plays the
piano and the organ, has some know-
ledge of the cello. “My impression of
our speech so far” (after 10,000 record-
ings) “is that we Australians don’t use
much range of pitch. We don’t make
much variation in the degree of promi-
nence of the more important sen-
tences. Our speech is uniform. There
is very little geographical variation. We
don’t seem to have pockets of speech
types as they do in the United States
(for instance, in the South). All this
evening out has developed in less than
200 years from a very mixed bag of a
beginning.”
His most impressive study so far has
been to tape the voices of thousands of
youngsters from all over the country,
in free discussion with teachers, in their
last year at school. Though some spoke
more fluently, and some extracted their
words like blood from stone, all spoke
very similarly. The girls were more
conscious of their speech, the boys were
still well and truly in the herd,
Despite the magnitude of the under-
taking (a concerted effort between Pro-
fessor A. G. Mitchell, Vice Chancellor
of Macquarie University and Professor
Delbridge) he realises that he lost many
voices on the way, because not every
type of voice manages to get through
to the final year of High School.
His future studies will probably be
with specific voices or types of voices
The main range of the Great Australian
Drawl falls into four categories
broad, general, cultivated and modified.
These are the ones to be dissected
further.
Delbridge has not found that the pure
Cockney voice appears, despite its
prevalence on Australian television
shows, and rhyming slang, presumed
to be so Australian, only occurs in war-
time or wherever a big group of men
are together being determinedly Aus-
tralian. Once the group disperses the
titfer slang goes with them.
“Speech,” said the Professor, “is only
the biological product of speech organs.
Family resemblances in voices reappear
again and again. I don’t think it matters
a damn how one speaks, unless it is
necessary for some specialised job, such
as acting. But everyone ought to have
ALL THEIR OWN WORK

enough command of his language to be
able to talk freely.”
This is the Professors’ pet hobby-
horse. “Children should indeed be
heard,” might be his slogan. The child
told to speak well, to round his vowels
and to be quiet in company, will grow
up to be the monosyllabic Australian
man. The little girl whose chatter is
not given a place in family discussions
will be the woman who can’t make a
speech at the CWA or perhaps can’t
even use a telephone without help.
Professor Delbridge feels that ideally
our school system should follow the
give-and-take style of the American
system, where discussion periods are
almost more important than lectures.
But the stiltedness of the Australian
system can be counteracted at home.
So, let the child speak any way he
wants to if you hope for an articulate
adult.
“We have no cause for complacency
in what we say so our intonation is
a minor offence.”
Acting in the Blood
LADY PILKINGTON, a jolly blonde
in her mid-forties and wife of the glass
tycoon, wishes she had been one of Mr.
Cochrane’s Young Ladies. They had
such a gay time of it, what with supper
dates and admiring escorts, while she, a
student at the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Art, had nothing but the dis-
cipline of early nights and early morn-
ings trying to memorise lines.
She did, however, live in a house
teeming with Mr. Cochrane’s Young
Ladies, so she knew the sort of life
they led. Never in bed before 3 a.m.,
and never up before noon. While she,
Lady Pilkington, then in her late teens,
crept around at 7 a.m. mugging up
Shakespeare, Mr. Cochrane’s Young
Ladies slept on with no more to worry
them than how they would look for the
cabaret that night, and what hat to
wear for a glamorous luncheon at one.
Lady Pilkington was doing her iron-
ing when we called on her in the pent-
house at Marton Hall, Sydney, prior
to her leaving with Sir Harry on the
last leg of their glass-making factory
tour. Would we care for some refresh-
ment? She had never made instant
coffee in her life, and didn’t know what
to do with a tea-bag. Her mother had
always taught her that neither habits
were very good for one. Together we
opened a tin of orange juice.
We had reached the point of Lady
Pilkington’s acting career when Sir
Harry arrived. He is not too keen on
theatrical chat (on meeting Googie
Withers for the first time he said ah,
yes, he knew her father, he was Chief
Air Raid Warden in Bolton during the
war) so conversation veered to glass.
In her 5| years of marriage—it is her
second—Lady Pilkington has become
quite an expert on the stuff. She can
tell at a glance what is good and what
is bad glass, and sometimes has great
difficulty resisting the urge to inform
the odd managing director or two that
what they think are beautiful windows
in theii executive suites are nothing of
the kind. Float glass is the new, big
thing now, and she cannot think why
all Sydney offices used polished plate.
On second thoughts she could, though.
It is supplied by A.C.1., who have a
stake in Pilkington s, Australia, so per-
haps we’d better forget that remark.
Sir Harry had taken to his bath by
now, so back to the theatricals, rather
more so to voce than before. Mr.
Cochranes Young Ladies began about
1933 and ended when World War II
began. They were modern Gaiety Girls,
really, feted by young men who took
them out for endless suppers. They
didn’t actually act. They stood around
and looked gorgeous - not in the nude
you know just decorative. Anna
Neagle was one and she’s made a mar-
vellous comeback, hasn’t she?”
T ,
ady Pilkington was sorry she had
no Gaiety Girl grandmother to rem-
misce over, but imagined acting was
in the blood somewhere, because April
Wilding, her daughter, was an actress,
If we had turned on our television set
last week we would have seen her in
“The Saint.” Things haven’t been
quite the same since April appeared in
a film about the Windmill Theatre, but
that’s the acting profession for you Get
coupled with a flop and it’s difficult to
retrieve the situation,

The Letters of Trevor Goosehoot
(Intercepted by Will Rushton)
Dear Mother,
I must confess that I do, on occasion, miss you. For instance, the time at the
last Election in Great Britain, when Harold Wilson was exhorting us to support
him in his quest for a new type of Conservatism and you threw your copy of
“The Wit of Sir Oswald Mosley” through the screen. Halcyon days! I miss the
cut-and-thrust of your politics. I have now seen both the leaders doing their
Party-piece on television, and whereas I’m certain that you would admire Mr.
Holt, the Liberal (with a capital L-plate), I think Mr. Calwell would have had
you cutting and thrusting all over the place. Mr. Holt is very similar to your
favorite, Mr. Edward Heath, even down to the constant display of three rows of
teeth. He is your kind of professional politician, well-applied make-up (on tele-
vision only, I hasten to add), the pores ever open to ooze sincerity, very clean,
and well dusted, well rehearsed, and a wonderful reader of the tele-prompter.
Lloyd George would die a death today. The sound technicians could never cope.
Oh, where are the hustings (or thrustings) of yesteryear? Behind a desk, in
front of a set composed of Encyclopaedia Britannicas with all the pages removed
in some television studio. No heckling, by order.
Calwell, on the other hand, is a tub-thumper of the old school. Admittedly,
thump often misses tub, but there was a whiff of old-fashioned electioneering.
I think his concern for the Aborigines would have been a good moment for
your book-tossing act. It would be nice to see him given a go in the twilight *of
his career. But it’s hard to choose. I sympathise with the soul who looks at both,
takes out his double-headed penny, tosses it, and shouts “tails.”
Love
Trevor.


There’s none that can compare
The story behind a $2-million launch
By APRIL HERSEY
Hold their position...
TEN years ago there was only a
handful of cigarette brands on the
Australian market, including Turf,
Capstan, Craven A, and Ardath, all
controlled by British Australian
Tobacco. Today there are 15 major
brands with probably 60 others clamor-
ing for a share in the market.
Latest to reach the public in a wave
of martial music and teaser advertising,
to the tune of $2,000,000, are Rothmans
Grenadiers, destined to appeal to that
great core of buyers—“the medium-
price-range group.”
Catapulted on to the market on the
first day of the financial year, in an
army-manoeuvre atmosphere which
could well be emulated by an enemy
planning an invasion of the country, the
Grenadiers were distributed by more
than 3000 people in 550 company and
distributor vehicles, train-lifted and air-
lifted to 85,000 retail outlets across the
country, with only a handful of people
knowing what it was all about. The
cigarettes were manufactured in Mel-
bourne and had to be dispatched from
there to points as far apart as Cairns
and north-west Australia. Scores of
millions of cigarettes were booked to
fly, bulk deliveries went by road and
rail. Special vans were laid on to carry
the mystery cigarettes from railheads
and road transport docks to retail out-
lets. On Friday the big advertising
campaign began. By Monday, July 4,
there could be no doubt in anyone’s
mind that the Grenadiers were here.
Why they were here and who needed
them is another story.
According to general manager Reg
Watson, of Rothmans, the time was
ripe for a medium-priced cigarette.
Rothmans have, he says, suffered an
overall sales loss of three to four per-
cent of their total market from the in-
roads of lower-priced cigarettes, notably
Escort.
Escort arrived in October, 1964, two
months after the first excise rise dealt
a blow to higher-priced cigarettes. It
was launched with a “quality” image,
and people wanting to buy a cheaper
cigarette which sounded as good as their
old brand bought it. By October, 1965,
it had grabbed about six percent of the
market. However, its rivals now claim
that it is losing part of this remarkable
gain. All the same, Escort this year is
still reputed to have sold at least 1000
million cigarettes.
Meanwhile, back at Rothmans, excise
restrictions weighed heavily. So much
so that until this year when the price of
cigarettes rose one cent a packet they
felt they could not consider marketing
a medium-priced cigarette. And they
did not want to enter the cheap field
with the Rothmans name.
Quality is very important to this firm,
which actually has its factory sprinkled
Form up their ranks...
with signs reading “Make every cigar-
ette a masterpiece.” So the new cigar-
ette, the firm says, contains the same
ingredients as Rothmans but is smaller
and lighter.
Having decided on the size and con-
tent and made up their minds to launch
the cigarette, Rothmans still had to pro-
duce a winner. Every cigarette
launched is aimed at a specific market.
Many are deliberately aimed at the 20
percent swingers—not the hep people,
but the indecisive ones. Like the swing-
ing voter, this elusive and highly lucra-
tive 20 percent is probably better
catered for than any other smoker.
Menthol cigarettes appeal particularly
to the young, sophisticated woman,
American blends such as Riggio and
Camel must be publicised with a young
man’s image, because researchers, who
appear to be at it every moment of the
day, have decided that the young
sportsman is more likely to light a
strong cigarette. This image of youth
has been so heavily propounded that one
comedian in America has made it part
of his routine to say: “Personally I’m
too old to smoke. I can’t swim, climb
mountains, fly helicopters. I’m not the
' international type. I need a cigarette for
slobs.”
The market is so competitive in Aus-
tralia, with five major companies fight-
ing for your cigarette allowance, that
anything one company produces may
be scuttled by counter-advertising be-
fore it reaches the tobacconist’s shelf.
Reg Watson grumbled: “The moment
you do something today, everyone is
on your back. A few years ago you got
a bit of a go. You were able to get, off
the ground.”
The new cigarette from Rothmans
needed general appeal if it was to chase
Escort off the market. But it had to be
advertised in some new way to lift it
from the great, grey sea of cigarette
advertising which the televiewer, in
particular, hears and sees without
remembering.
The managing director of Rothmans,
Mr. D. N. Engela, decided to follow
the same pattern that the parent com-
pany in England established with
Guards, and suggested the name Gren-
adiers. However, even within the fac-
tory, the code name “Buckinghams” was
used.
Though initially suggested nine
months before it reached the market,
the Grenadier cigarette campaign re-
mained locked within the secret world
of the top brass at Rothmans until
May 1, when advertising agency Foote,
Cone, and Belding were called in to
publicise it.

of Rothmans, this American advertising
agency (which bought out BCJP in
1964) proceeded to plan one of the
fastest campaigns ever devised in
Sydney.
As a yardstick they had samples of
the Guards cigarette advertising, which
they were asked to consider and im-
prove upon. Concerning everyone
greatly was the knowledge that Craven
A had been associated with a marching
theme, and still had a lot of useful
footage with which to swamp the
market.
Account executive Alistair Miller, of
Foote, Cone, and Belding, felt that the
appeal was strong enough to weather
any opposition, particularly if they
stayed exclusively with the Grenadier
Guards. By good luck, Trooping the
Color on June 3 coincided with the
formulation of the campaign.
There was surprisingly little conflict
between the client and the campaigners,
possibly because of the time factor,
Rothman’s okayed the outline of young
Mr. Miller’s plan to spend part of the
estimated $2 million, which included
sending someone to England to film
Trooping the Color. Cameraman John
Leake and director Harvey Spencer
went to London.
JJERE they found that the only dis-
tinction between a Grenadier
Guard and any other sort of guard is a
small white plume on the busby and the
position of the buttons on his jacket.
Trooping took place on a day so hot
that Guardsmen fell like flies. Getting
the film with the right plumes and but-
tons and without recumbent Guardsmen
was the hardest part of the whole cam-
paign.
Keeping the whole thing secret once
the agency had the account was the
second hardest part. At least 20 speci-
alists, TV producers, writers, artists, re-
search people, and actors had to know
something, no matter how conspiratorial
the atmosphere might j)e during their
briefing.
Gradually the two 10-second tele-
vision commercials, the four 30-second
commercials, the newspaper and radio
campaigns were hammered out. To
confuse the issue as much as possible,
different people were used to produce
segments, and the overall planning was
fragmented. The packs were printed
secretly, though near-panic resulted
when so,me spoiled packaging material
turned up in the City Markets in Syd-
ney.
Finally co-ordinating with the rev-
ving-up of the new fleet of Ford Falcon
delivery sedans, all painted in Grena-
dier colors and featuring a double-sided
sign mounted on the roof, and all the
rest of the transport, teaser advertising
announced with a final flourish: “The *
Grenadiers are coming.” Some befud-
dled people tried to buy tickets for the
parade.
On Monday, July '4, American In-
dependence Day, we knew that the
Grenadiers were not coming to the
Stadium but were to be smoked. That
they were, in fact, right here.
And here despite the fatality rate of
flfcw cigarettes (one launch in ten is
really successful), Grenadiers may well
stay. In the first two months, according
to Rothmans, they cornered about three
percent of the market, are nibbling at
the heels of the top fifteen. All they
have to do, according to their sponsors,
is “hold their position, form up their
ranks, and charge on to greater suc-
cesses.”
The five big cigarette manufacturers
who are all thriving on our 11 million
population say comfortably: “If you
don >, smoke no will some d »
Qnly one firm really interested X ; n

T u he smoking are rising faster

turers alike—the Australian cigarette in-
dustry is going up in smoke with cheer-
ful extravagance.


AROUND MELBOURNE
Courage, Not to Stumble, Brother
YOU must appreciate that Mel-
burnians feel deeply about
beer. Indeed a genuine coat of
arms for the city of Melbourne
would depict a nest of beer cans,
a meat pie, a footy guernsey, and
a TAB ticket.
Ah, but once upon a time we
were a wonderful beer State. In
1856 we had 35 breweries. In 1870
almost anyone could become a
brewer and ,some little towns had
two breweries. It was marvellous —
there were 70 towns which possessed
one or more breweries and our
grand total was 116.
We failed to drink as well during
the great depression of the ’niheties
and by 1894 we were down to 63
breweries, and so we sank and sank
and sank. In 1907 there was the
formation of the Carlton & United
Breweries, which absorbed the
Carlton Brewery, McCracken’s City
Brewery, the Victoria, the Castle-
maine, the Shamrock, and the Foster
breweries. Alas, after that it was
like the ten little nigger boys. The
breweries at Geelong and Bendigo
went in 1925, Ballarat succumbed in
1958, and in 1961 we thought that
the mighty Charringtons Brewery
of London might step in and buy
the Richmond plant. CUB got there
first and the last little nigger boy
had been devoured.
The supreme command at the
brewery is Sir Reginald Fogarty and
for a long time he has felt the
strength of a monopoly. Back in
1959 the Australian Hotels Associa-
tion instructed its Victorian mem-
bers to put up the price of their
beer by a penny a glass and two-
pence a bottle. The brewery hotels
stayed pat, the others put up the
price. Mr. Fogarty, as he was then,
felt an increase in price would cause
a drop in consumption. Every hotel
that put up its price immediately
was cut off without a drop. The
Richmond Brewery could do noth-
ing, it was too small. The battle
was all over in a week. The AHA
had to capitulate. It was proved
then that one man controlled the
price of beer in Victoria.
Why is one relating all this? Be-
cause the Courage Brewery of Eng-
land, showing much more courage
than Charringtons, has announced
plans for a $ll million brewery in
Melbourne, and it will be a real
broth of a battle.
At the Liquor Royal Commission
in 1962 the CUB and the Commis-
sioner, Mr. P. D. Phillips, Q.C.,
clashed repeatedly. At one stage
Mr. Phillips demanded to know
CUB’s production figures. Sir
Reginald said he had seen a bro-
chure about a brewery that wanted
to start here and he took out a
Supreme Court writ to restrain Mr.
Phillips. But P.D. won and got
his figures.
Then there was the day at the
Commission when John Thomas
Rowan, proprietor of the Jindera
Hotel, just over the border in
N.S.W., called Sir Reginald an
“irascible, pedantic dictator.” You
see, CUB and Tooths and Tooheys
in Sydney had an agreement under
which they did not supply each
other’s customers. Rowan said his
customers preferred Sydney beer
eight to one and he wanted to give
them a choice. It was an idea that
didn’t meet with favor in Melbourne.
Yes, we play this beer business
fairly vigorously. When Courage
announced their plans there was the
usual message from the CUB
citadel: “No comment.”
The new venture saw amber light
at the Southern Cross Hotel and it
was interesting to note that Courage
was not going it alone, a third of
the capital was coming from British
Tobacco. We would have been most
interested to know whether the new
beer would be king size, longer,
cooler, smoother, with fine flavor
coming through, but the gathering
was oiled with a dozen bottles of the
inevitable Fosters.
The chairman elect of the new
company is Sir Maurice Nathan, who
also is chairman and managing dir-
ector of a furniture company, Pater-
sons, which wouldn’t seem to qualify
him as a brewer. However, the old
Richmond Brewery used to be
known as the Richmond Nathan Sys-
tem Brewing Co. Pty. Ltd. and the
old ads always claimed that the
Nathan system produced superior
lager beer, to all other beers. What’s
more, Sir Maurice is a former Lord
Mayor of Melbourne, and this fits
in very nicely. The first Mayor of
Melbourne, Henry Condell, back in
1842, was a brewer. He came over
from Tasmania in 1839 and built a
brewery in Little Bourke Street. He
called his beer “Condell’s Entire.”
We would very much like to see a
hearty beer called “Sir Maurice’s
Entire” or “Nathan’s Entire,” but
at this stage the signs are not good.
Your correspondent had hoped
it would be like the grand old 1870
days when there were light beers
and dark beers, genuine mild beers
and bitter beers, stingos, ales, and
all. Sir Maurice, however, says the
new beer will be distinctly Victorian
and not greatly different from that
produced by Carlton & United.
Now, all Melburnians were taught
at their mother’s knee that Mel-
bourne beer was the finest liquid
ever granted to mankind. It came
from a pure and beautiful water
supply and its glorious flavor could
not be repeated anywhere. The
real truth is that all Australian
breweries, except Coopers, in recent
years have adopted the light, bitter
style. In tasting with masked bottles,
99 drinkers out of a 100 cannot tell
the difference between Sydney, Mel-
bourne, Hobart, Perth, Brisbane, or
Adelaide beer. There is a fine society
of drinkers in Melbourne called the
Beer Appreciation Society. They
have a weekly lunch (actually they
don’t waste time with food) and they
have a weekly masked bottle. The
president, Brian Fogarty, who has
been tasting for a long time, says it
is now very difficult to tell the dif-
ference between Australian beers.
So it seems a pity that Courage are
coming here to make precisely the
same charming, domestic beer that
Sir Reginald already makes with
alarming efficiency.
No doubt Courage has gone over
the figures with great care. CUB
makes $7 million a year profit that
is about 20 percent on capital. The
Melbourne “Herald” economist, Jack
Eddy, says their assets are worth
more thaji $9O million. CUB owns
150 hotels or about 10 percent of all
pubs in Victoria. This is not a great
percentage compared with other
States, but hotelkeepers are not
notoriously brave, and in a no-holds-
barred battle will they have the
courage to switch to Courage? We
remember Charringtons in 1961.
They wouldn’t start here unless they
could get signed assurances from
Victorian hotelkeepers which would
guarantee them the sale of eight
million gallons of beer a year, a
small figure, but they never got
those guarantees.
Furthermore, according to evid-
ence given at the Liquor Inquiry, we
have 200 more hotels in Victoria
than are really necessary. Sir
Maurice says his company doesn’t
really want to buy up hotels, and
one can only hope Courage will get
enough outlets without doing so. In
the meantime, let us all sing in
unison the fine old Methodist hymn:
Courage, brother!
Do not stumble,
Though thy path be dark as night.

COAL A DAY!
A5BO/7
At Morwell Victoria, the longest single-flight,
high-speed' conveyor system in Australia is
carrying brown coal from the open cut to Hazel-
wood Power Station, 1| miles away. Plans for the
conveyor system were adopted by the State
Electricity Commission Victoria after a thorough
investigation of all means of transporting-coal
over such a distance.
Built to exacting specifications by Goodyear
Tyre and Rubber Co. (Australia) Ltd., the two
steel cable conveyors operate at a speed of 1050
feet a minute carrying 2000 tons of coal an hour.
The belts are 7244 feet and 8560 feet long, 48
inches wide, approximately J inch thick and con-
sist entirely of rubber and 500 miles of steel
cables. Minimum breaking strength is 423,000
pounds. The structure of the belt allows the cable
maximum lateral movement. There is no tearing
under impact!
The seven miles of Goodyear belting used on
the two mainlines for Hazelwood is another
example of the numerous advantages of steel
cable belting. It has an extremely high tensile
strength. Its design makes it trough perfectly and
have the best impact resistance of any belt con-
struction. Stretching and elongation is negligible
so short take up lengths are possible.
If you have a project where you need conveyor
belting remember Goodyear conveyor belting. It’s
the best. Contact the Goodyear technical man at
the Goodyear branch inyour state.

frequency of our services—daily
jet flights from Singapore to
Hong Kong, Osaka, Taipei and
Tokyo, convenient connections
between Singapore, Hong Kong

Hell in High Water
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
A (wet, soaking, sodden) day at
Paddington: organised by the Art
Gallery Society of New South
Wales, and taking in Victoria Barracks,
seven shops, seven art galleries, six
private houses, three restaurants, and
one pub.
It is a moot point whose heart sank
the farthest at the ghastly weather:
those who had opened their places to
the public, or the 700 public who had
paid their two dollars and were going
to get their money’s worth come hell or,
as it turned out, high water.
Down at the Barracks, a gathering
of dripping females cluttered up Regi-
mental Sergeant-Major Wildman’s
guardroom veranda. He had seen
some to-ing and fro-ing of traffic in
his time, but this party seemed a likely
threat to law and order. Would they
care to go inside and watch the guards
change? Some ladies misunderstood and
blushed. The 21 guards continued play-
ing darts.
Mr. Wildman had just launched into
an historical monologue about his guard-
room being built in 1841 by convicts
and how it hadn’t changed one iota to
this (wet, soaking, sodden) day, when
the telephone rang. An officer appeared
in the doorway, saluted and said he
regretted to announce that in view of
the er inclement conditions, the
ceremonial changing of the guard had
been cancelled. “The next time you
come you’d better bring better weather
with you,” he added unnecessarily.
'J'O the casual observer, it would seem
at this point that the Day was
destined for failure. But through steam-
ing car windows it became apparent,
as we motored around Paddington, that
there were many, many ladies with
Tour Badges pinned on their bosoms
determined to make a go of things.
At the house of Mrs. Jack Lee,
granddaughter of cattle king Sir Syd-
ney Kidman, 400 ladies came and went
before lunch. Mrs. Lee was staggered
by it all and retired to her daughter’s
roped-off bedroom to write letters. One
attraction, said the souvenir program,
was that Mitty Lee Brown the artist
once lived there and the Earl of
Jersey bought the house, then single
storey, and added to it for his mistress.
“Is that bit about his mistress true?”
asked Mr. Ron Saw, the well-known
Sydney columnist. “Yes,” said Mrs. Lee.
“No,” said Mr. Lee, later, “it is not.
He made it up.”
Our next call was at Mrs. Peter
Lloyd-Jones along the road. We carried
out wet-weather drill of discarding boots
and propping up umbrellas outside like
old hands. Some old hands brought
carpet slippers. Others tied plastic bags
round their shoes. A very old hand
immersed her entire head into a plastic
bag, oblivious of danger of suffocation.
We learnt here that the guards (ladies
of the AGS posted in each room to
keep a steady eye on things), like their
counterparts at the Barracks, did four
hours on and two hours off; noted Mr.
Lloyd-Jones’ collection of racy head-
gear, including pith helmet, then set
off for Mrs. Cullen’s residence behind
the Lord Dudley pub.
She had sprung a leak in her roof.
Hers was a small house and the plumber
was a very large man who timed his
arrival with about 50 of the public.
How he got through the tiny loft-trap
no one knew, but it was a good job he
did, because five minutes later the ceil-
ing would have fallen in. Mrs. Cullen’s
car was waterlogged two streets away,
so it was clearly not her day. All the
same, she said, getting the house ready
for the AGS had made her get things
done.
Mr. Dick Keep had been forced to
close the top floor of his Hargrave
Street house after “this morning’s little
lot,” but downstairs three guards
watched over his treasures with bulldog
ferocity. One mopped Mr. Keep’s
polished floor after each entrant, and
another handed out Mr. Keep’s typed
list of objets d’art with the command
that it was to be returned when read.
What with this and the third guard’s
running commentary on the bus service
to Bondi Junction, coupled with hints
about missing her tea, we were too ner-
vous to make a note of Mr. Keep’s
Circas and all we can remember is
“picture of D. Keep by D. Friend.”
Up Cascade Street for the twentieth
time, round to Mr. Neville Marsh’s pad
in Underwood Street. Mrs. Inge Mc-
Arthur was in charge here, and she
could write a book on the day’s happen-
ings. What hadn’t been said about Mr.
Marsh’s couch, and the offers they
had made for his furniture . . . Mr.
Marsh said he should have taped it all,
and left for an evening’s entertainment
elsewhere. Some visitors had been a
little awkward. One large, fat man had
used the telephone without even asking
(a newspaperman? suggested another
guard), and certain rules laid down had
been difficult to keep to. Keeping
people out of closed rooms was one
thing, keeping them out of the lavatory
another. “A leak,” cried a guard, “A
leak upstairs, it’s pouring on the car-
pet.” Mrs. McArthur grabbed Mr.
Marsh’s best turquoise bath towel and
disappeared. Through strains of Bach
came irate miaowing from Mr. Marsh’s
cat; we collected our thrice-blown-in-
side-out umbrella and staggered to the
last house of the day.
We kept it short. Mr. Kerry Fitz-
gerald’s stone cottage was once officers’
quarters of the barracks and on a clear
day you could see the exercise yard.
Like Mr. Wildman’s guardroom it was
built by convicts, but, unlike it, had
been modernised: the guardroom kept

The Battle of the Beaches
By JACK POLLARD
DESPITE the excitment over the
danger surf-riders create for ortho-
dox surfers when they lose control
of their boards, it should be clear to
all except a few suburban aldermen
that all surf-riders are not hoodlums.
The ban-the-boards councils seem
unaware that our surfriders are prob-
ably the fittest, sharpest, toughest group
in any Australian sport. Theirs is a
supreme feat of athleticism. Riders
often remain out in rough seas for three
to four hours at a
time. Swims of
half a mile to re-
trieve a board are
frequent.
Girls like Tanya
Binning stay out
three hours at a
stretch catching
waves. And do the
aldermen who so
glibly condemn
this sport as a
whole, because of
a few, know that
the longest re-
corded surfhoard
ride is a prodi-
gious 26 miles by
Hobie Alter, of the
United States,
in Catalina Channel, off California, in
April, 1964? Alter’s ride lasted as long
as some council meetings—9o minutes.
Surely the Australian exponents of
this breathtaking sport, winning world
attention as they are for their skill,
deserve something better than to be
grouped with a few larrikins who defy
beach signs, surf where they please, and
sometimes brawl on the beaches.
Every second passenger who strolls
off the Monterey, staggering beneath his
weight in cameras, says he’s been at-
tracted to spend his tourist dollars here
by films of our beaches and by the Nat
Youngs, Midget Farrellys, and Bob
]Pikes. Body surfing doesn’t compare for
camera-impact with the board-riders
sliding down the front of a big one.
_-The anti-surfboards faction is merely
burying its head in the foam if it fails
to recognise that board-riders will con-
tinue to increase in numbers. Sales of
new boards are multiplying despite fore-
casts two or three years ago that surf-
riding was a short-lived craze. Board-
riders just do not go away and try some
other sport because councils claim there
are not enough of them to deserve their
attention.
I doubt if we will ever see in Aus-
tralia the position which exists in
America and Hawaii, where body
surfers are barred from some beaches
reserved exclusively for board-riding.
A sensible attempt should be made,
however, to accommodate the swelling
band of Australian board-riders.
The problem is complicated by the
whims of the sea itself. Although we
like to boast that Australia has the best
beaches in the world, this is pure hum-
bug. They are a long way from the
best, surfing beaches for boards or
bodies and they are often dirty.
We lack the powerful off-shore cur-
rents, the reefs, and headlands shapes
. which build up good surfing water with
unfailing regularity. It is not possible
to go to a single Australian beach
assured that waves fit for riding will be
thrown up on it. It’s a fair bet, how-
ever, that you might spot or smell
sewage outflow.
Even if the councils would oblige,
we cannot tell our surf-riders to take,
say, Tamarama Beach as an exclusive
beach for board-riders and stay off
adjacent Bronte and Bondi. For there
is no certainty, dear aldermen, that the
waves which riders hunt will roll in at
Tamarama.
Essentially board-riders are nomads
who must go where the big waves are,
which is why Surf Life Saving Clubs,
pinned as they are to one beach, can-
not get surf-riders to join and help
patrol their beaches.
The best solution suggested so far
in this council v. surf-riders brouhaha
is that board-riders should have the
exclusive use of beaches for two hours
early in the morning 6 a.m. until
8 a.m. and for the two hours before
darkness at night. These are the times
when the best waves appear.
This notion, proposed by our world
surf-riding champion Nat Young, will
interfere with the early-morning swims
of a lot of surfers prominent busi-
nessmen, hung-over actors and artists
among them. But it is the best way out
of the impasse which has been sug-
gested so far.
The Surf Life Saving Association of
Australia has done itself incalculable
harm by its handling of the board-
riding craze. By refusing to officially
recognise board-riders and taking them
into the association, they forced board-
riders to form a movement of their
own, thus denying the association the
recruits which it always needs.
Bans never have worked very well
in the Australian outdoors. To take a

parallel from another sport, something
like 700 Australian shooters are
wounded in shooting accidents every
year, many of them youngsters who, the
law says, should not touch firearms, a
number of them on Sundays, when in
some States they are not supposed to
shoot. The lesson is that it does not
lessen a boy’s curiosity in firearms to
deprive him of them.
As with the surfboard problem, the
solution in sporting shooting lies in a
strong program of education in which
a teenager can be taught how to handle
a firearm without maiming himself,
Strange as it may seem to aldermen,
there are still many teenagers who don’t
know where the signs are or that they
are there to protect body surfers
just as there are New Australians who
believe you do not need to know how
to swim if you have a surfboard or
rubber float. A vigorous education pro-
gram is needed and it could start in
the schools, where much of our sporting
instruction begins.
Twenty-seven Good Reasons
By DON LIPSCOMBE
ENGLISH economic journalist John
Brunner, who recently migrated
to Perth, was in the news several
weeks ago when an article he had
written essentially as a parody
was reported deadpan in Australian
newspapers.
Asked by London “Spectator” to list
his reasons for leaving Britain, he bor-
rowed the format Sir Willia,m Haley
had used in a learned editorial in “The
Times” headed “Why the Pound Is
Weak” ... 27 resounding causes for
sterling’s decline. Brunner sent this up,
writing about “Why the Bonds Are
Weak” the bonds between him and
Britain—again with 27 reasons.
And none raised more Australian eye-
brows than this paragraph:
“Because I have considerable respect
for a man, by name Charles Court, who
has been the prime mover in this
-(Western Australian) development, an
enthusiast in a cause for which I, too,
can enthuse. In this country (Britain)
too often the choice seems to lie be-
tween the suckers and the knockers.”
The mention by name of the West’s
Industrial Development Minister was
the editor’s idea; when nobody was
named in the article originally, the
editor had assumed the man referred
to was Sir Robert Menzies (“the only
Australian most Britons have heard
of”). But John Brunner has found no
reason to water down this eulogy after
having worked as a consultant to Mr.
Court’s department since arriving in
Perth. The two men have common
characteristics: an impatience with
“knockers” (this is one of Mr. Court’s
favorite epithets), a corresponding in-
terest in getting things done, and a
suspicion of intellectuals who, as Brun-
ner put it, “seldom are concerned with
practising what they preach.”
When it comes to economics, 39-
year-old Brunner is a heretic. After
three years as an economic adviser to
Britain’s Treasury he has put up strong
claims for being burnt at the stake by
comparing what economics said would
happen with what actually did happen.
He did this in a BBC broadcast
he had previously been producer of
economic and industrial programs there
as well as in a pamphlet which be-
came hotly contentious. He says:
“There’s an awful lot of nonsense talked
about economic planning. A few econ-
omists get together with a few figures,
call it a plan, and say: ‘This is pro-
gress.’ Yet often they are dealing with
matters that quite palpably couldn’t
have been predicted.
“Despite the highly sophisticated
mathematical techniques now available
to economic planners, there has been no
improvement, unless you call being able
to blind the layman with science im-
provement. By and large I have found
it a good principle to do what is out of
fashion. For example, the gas industry
was out of -fashion in Britain, and
look at it now; atomic energy was vir-
tually written off and is making great
strides. And the same principle applies
to buying out-of-fashion shares.”
This conviction about economists and
their fashions was reflected in his
“Spectator” piece when he wrote: “Be-
cause I have probably seen more of the
country’s public life than is good for
me and have become disenchanted in
the process, there seem to me to be
too many pundits who have been
proved consistently wrong and never
had the grace to admit it, too many
journalists content to be fed and
watered by authority, too many
academics who are but dedicated fol-
lowers of intellectual fashion.
“Because I am particularly attracted
by a corner of Australia the size of
Western Europe, which is currently
enjoying a classic phase of industrial

THE
EMPLOYMENT
OF
CAPITAL
W. J. Holcroft,
Chief Executive &
General Manager,
BRAMBLES
INDUSTRIES LIMITED
Any businessman who has visited the U.S.A. in the last few years
could not help but be impressed by the attention American Manage-
ment gives to the measurement of the rate of productivity relative
to capital employed. As a recent Commonwealth Treasury publica-
tion pointed out, management in Australia has tended to concern
itself more with the task of obtaining capital than with the most
economical use of it.
Of course, there has been some justification for this when one takes
into account the shortage in Australia of capital for development, but,
on the other hand, this gives added reason to the need for utilising
the most modern techniques of capital expenditure appraisal to
ensure that what we have, we spend wisely and well.
It is pleasing to note that the Treasury is giving a great deal of
thought to the application of such techniques in the public sector of
our economy and with their application in industry on a much wider
scale than at present, our full national resources will come to bo
harnessed to provide the greater benefits for the community at
large.
Brambles is essentially a Service Company. Its purpose is to
provide fully maintained services of many kinds to industry by
the supply of the most modern earthmoving, transport and materials
handling equipment together with skilled operators and advice.
This conserves industry's capital for its traditional profit areas and
at the same time makes available the latest equipment to ensure the
maximum efficiency and economy in those areas.
To fulfil a need arising from the growing awareness by many
managements of a more critical philosophy on the use of capital
resources, CHEP has recently developed a long term Rental Plan
for Fork Lift Trucks, Material Carriers, Pallet Trucks and an
increasing range of similar equipment. This Plan offers specialist
advice on the selection of the right equipment, expert service and
maintenance facilities, replacement equipment to meet breakdowns,
operator training programmes and lastly but not least of all, the
conservation of capital for the continuation of the main stream
development of each business so served.
This issue of Brambles News announces this extension of our
Service to industry and the study of the advantages of "rental with
Service" is commended to ail who must make the decision whether
to rent or to own capital goods. CHEP has operational and financial
advisers willing and able to help in this appraisal.

FACETS OF
CHEP
Miss Yvette Davis, Secretary to the N.S.W. Manager of
CHEP, at the controls of a Towmotor fork lift truck.
Recently CHEP published the "Fork Lift Truck Operating
Manual," which is an authoritative and well presented
publication written by CHEP's own staff.
The Manual attracted the attention of the N.S.W. Division of
the National Safety Council, resulting in the establishment
of a Training School for fork lift truck operators con-
ducted jointly by the Council and CHEP.
As the Manager’s Secretary, Yvette became interested in
the work of setting up the Course for the first schools and
to prove its effectiveness, volunteered to undertake the
three-day Course herself. As one anonymous mere male
said to her, "If we can teach you to drive a fork lift truck
we can teach anyone," but Yvette took this in good part
she knows that you can’t change a man’s opinion of women
drivers. All credit to Yvette despite never having driven
a car she came through the three-day Course with
flying colours.
The Courses are now a regular part of CHEP Service in
conjunction with the National Safety Council in the interests
of safety and efficiency.

THE
CHEP
RENTAL
PUN
This month CHEP announces its new Rental Plan, a
concept which has been developed from the best
features of similar plans in the U.S.A. where
industry, and particularly major companies, have
recognised a requirement for long-term rental, with
service, of plant and equipment.
The origins of CHEP (known in World War II as
Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pool) were in
the provision of pools of fork lift trucks and
pallets for hire throughout Australian industry. To-
day CHEP operates by far the largest pools of
equipment in the Commonwealth, with branches ,at
Brisbane, Sydney, Wollongong, Shepparton, Mel-
bourne, Adelaide and Fremantle. Its extensive
workshop and service facilities for fork lift trucks
are unparalleled in this country.
The CHEP Rental Plan is a logical extension to those
hiring facilities and provides another new and vital
service to Industries needing long-term use of
modern equipment without capital outlay yet still
backed with the traditional CHEP service.
New and authoritative techniques in the financial
appraisal of rental/purchase considerations demon-
strate the economic advantages of “rental with
service" in this field.
Today CHEP can offer any industry an impartial
advisory service for whatever period of time is
necessary, the type, size, capacity, accessories, and
brand of equipment most suited, and will back up
their selection with maintenance programmes,
operator training, provision of replacement equip-
ment in emergencies, and many other features of
the unique CHEP organisation.

Horizons are made to be reached ...
Time was when the world was thought to
be flat. Until someone sailed out past the
horizon —and didn’t fall off!
Frigrite are forever finding new horizons,
reaching out to find a better way—in air-
conditioning, refrigeration, agriculture and
industry.
CREATING THE CLIMATE FOR PROGRESS
take-off and yet remains remarkably
unspoilt and unsophisticated.” Of this
reference to Western Australia he now
adds: “Most economists are prepared
to regard this phase only in terms of
capital-output ratio and so on. I be-
lieve it was more a matter of the right
people at the right time stumbling by
accident on the right technologies.
Charles Court has been the catalyst.”
He sees Australia’s economic growth
on a broader plane than most Austra-
lians, who desire growth only as a
bridge to increasing affluence. He says
of his preference, as an economist, for
Australia: ‘The British don’t want eco-
nomic growth—it is being wished upon
them by economists. Here it is a matter
of life and death.” He had touched
the same nerve in “The Spectator”: “I
believe that in Australia one of the
great dramas of history will be played
out in the rest of this century.” For he
believes that this country will be, in
his own phrase, “contested territory,”
and he sees “a pitiful lack of under-
standing of this” within the country.
“You can see the Treasury mind at
its worst, for example, among those
who look at the Ord purely on the basis
of cost - benefit analysis. Australia is
becoming the testing place of the pink
man’s ability in these parts —not only
literally to his ability to survive but
his ability to till the soil. And there has
been no proof that this can or will be
done.”
JOHN BRUNER’S interest in Aus-
tralia has been strengthened by
long correspondence with a number of
people here, as well as meetings with
other Austrophiles economists, in-
dustrialists, and journalists who include
Robin Day, fellow member of Oxford
University Liberal Club and later a
colleague at the BBC (Day married
brilliant young Perth lawyer Katherine
Ainslie). Brunner came out a year ago
at the time of the Test, bought a home
overlooking the Swan, then returned to
finish off with “The Observer,” where
he has been assistant manager since
1961.
His inquiries since arriving have
turned up the interesting fact that the
so-called Western Australian economic
boom, which for at least three years
has been loudly heralded in political
and financial corridors, is only now
beginning to show through in statistics.
But he is most unlikely to use this
against the Government, for this is
neither his desire nor his assignment.
It is typical of Charles Court that
such a man as Brunner would want to
work with him. As an adviser he would
be far more inclined to give an econ-
omic justification for Mr. Court doing
what comes naturally than explain why
it should not be done, as so many
economists are inclined to do. This
would be among the rare cases where
Mr. Court would suffer criticism gladly.
Non-constructive criticism and other
negative attitudes have no place within
the Court camp. As one of his key
men puts it: “We want you to say it is
half full, not half empty.”


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
The First Ten Years
By PATRICK TENNISON
MORE as a commemoration than
a celebration, the Television
Society of Australia marked the
10th anniversary of TV in Australia
with a seminar on those first 10 years at
St. Martin’s Theatre, Melbourne, last
week.
Speakers, in order, were Victoria’s
Senator Sam Cohen, who was highly
critical of the goings-on of the 10 years,
Mr. Clyde Packer, who seemed pretty
pleased with it all and confident of
continued success, and Mr. Ken Watts
of the ABC, who was surgically scath-
ing, but gave everyone the fairly rare
treat of finding out how and why the
ABC thinks and operates as it does.
This was really the only new ground
broken.
Senator Cohen was a member of the
1962-63 Senate Committee of Inquiry
into Australian television and films. The
committee labored for a year and
finally produced its report the Vin-
cent Report, named for its chairman,
Senator Vincent to Parliament on
October 29, 1963. It has since been
debated three times in the Senate, but,
Senator Cohen pointed out glumly, not
one Minister has yet come forward to
indicate the Government’s attitude to
it.
pERHAPS befitting a man of the
Senate, Senator Cohen’s language
in his address was the most colorful and
violent. The Vincent Report had paved
the way for progress, but had been sub-
stantially ignored by those it tried to
help. Television’s first 10 years in Aus-
tralia had been years of substantial
achievement, but also of lost oppor-
tunities. It had failed to develop an
Australian culture or orientation. Pros-
pects are so bad, many writers, artists,
producers, and performers go overseas,
no longer content to sit and chew their
fingernails watching overseas per-
formers doing things' they could do.
We are suffering, Senator Cohen said,
from programs which are largely syn-
thetic because so many are imported.
Since 1963, foreign exchange spent for
imported films had doubled to the
1964-65 figure of $l6 million. The end
result; we are faced with a “cultural
malaise.”
Mr. Packer, who is chairman of
GTV9 in Melbourne and a director on
the board of TCN9 in Sydney, followed
and set about demolishing just about
every argument the Senator had just
put up.
His main ground for demolishing
criticism was the huge public success
story of Australian TV in these forma-
tive 10 years. There had emerged 40
stations providing entertainment for
two million homes. And people are
watching it 30 hours a week —75 per-
cent of the time that they spend earn-
ing a living. Sydney viewers have avail-
able 334 program-hours a week. By
comparison, London viewers are offered
only 163 hours weekly, and most Euro-
pean cities get less. The French Gov-
ernment channel, for instance, operates
only 96 hours weekly.
Australian TV’s rate of take-off, as
Mr. Packer put it, outpaced America’s.
America took 10 years of TV to reach
77 percent TV home ownership. Aus-
tralia took nine years to reach 78 per-
cent —and credit for that must go to
the commercial stations who draw about
nine-tenths of viewers. Obviously, com-
mercial TV was giving the public what
it wanted.
Then Mr. Packer turned to the Vin-
cent Committee and it will probably
never be quite the same again. Of the
seven senators on it, he said, three came
from W.A. and one from Tasmania. At
the time the committee formed, W.A.
had one commercial TV station and
Tasmania had two which were some
distance apart. So most members of
the committee came from States where
TV was not competitive. Apart from
the religious and education bodies who
sent witnesses to the committee, eight
organisations gave evidence. Four of
them were from W.A. The committee
heard 139 witnesses, of whom 86 were
connected with the industry or could
be deemed to benefit from the outcome
of the inquiry. Could their testimony
be regarded as anything but private
interest? Of the 10 university people
who gave evidence, five were from W.A.
Seven religious faiths sent witnesses,
but three were from W.A.
“These people couldn’t truly be de-
scribed as representative of broad
public opinion. The committee also
accepted evidence from people who
didn’t know what they were talking
about. These people frequently said
they didn’t own sets but watched at
friends’ places. The chairman himself
spent most of his life at Kalgoorlie,
where there’s no TV at all.”
In the next ten years Mr. Packer saw
bigger opportunities for “package” pro-
duction companies. “But,” he added, “I
do not believe there will ever be a
regular place on commercial television
for quality indigenous drama. There
are, however, other types of drama of
a more-popular type which undoubtedly
can be produced in Australia ‘Homi-
cide’ is an example—and which do and
will attract an audience.”
Just as Mr. Packer had fired at
Senator Cohen, he, in turn, was fired
at by the following speaker, Mr. Ken
Watts, Federal Director of ABC-TV
Programs. Mr. Watts began by answer-
ing commercial critics of ABC-TV:
“It is curious that if only a few
people watch us, someone queries our
right of existence. If more watch and
we draw viewers away from the com-
mercial stations and become competi-
tive, we are told that is not what we’re
supposed to do.”
But no matter what anybody said, the
ABC is obviously going to continue its
competitive line. Mr. Watts explained
how and why.
“I believe TV isn’t the ‘wasteland of
America’ as some people have claimed,”
he said. “Rather, it’s pretty near a
garbage-pit. The Americans have found
the answer to general demand and
they’re supplying it with garbage.
Beautifully produced and colorful, but
garbage. The trouble is everybody’s
finding the recipe, so the commercial
ratings are about even. But less people
are now looking at TV in America.”
The ABC, he explained, had studied
the problem and decided it was a matter
of finding the difference between
absolute demand and general demand.
There are absolute demands for serious
public affairs programs, high quality
entertainment, adventure, and release.
The ABC pattern was to cater for these.
But it would not cater for general de-
mand, which gets down to a pretty low
common denominator.
Surveys had shown that 65 percent
of Australians tuned into the ABC some
time each day. That, and not the total
audience, was the figure he was inter-
ested in. The ABC would put out the
broadest possible range of programs
“from romp to serious drama” and
capitalise on what is known from re-
search that there is a relationship be-
tween breadth of appeal and viewer-
loyalty. Stations that go for general
demand continually eventually lose
people’s respect, as underlined by de-
clining viewing figures in the U.S. The
ABC’s aim for the years ahead was to
John Allen
as Doctor Moloch


get 90 percent of the population watch-
ing at least once every day.
Satellite TV got very little mention
overall. Senator Cohen mourned that,
when it came, Australia would be
geared only to sending programs on
kangaroos or football. Mr. Watts feared
TV would just become a satellite-
dominated garbage pit.
FILMS
Heroes All
Battle of the Bulge. Director, Ken Anna-
kin.
Inside Daisy Clover. Director, Robert
Mulligan.
According to “Battle of the
Bulge,” it was Henry Fonda who
won the war for us. And all
these years I’ve believed it was Errol
Flynn. But he was in the Pacific theatre;
Fonda, it appears, was our European
saviour.
I’d be the last to know just how his-
torically accurate the film is—l suspect
not very- —but even if it sticks like glue
to recoi'ded fact it is still totally uncon-
vincing. It is a routine war drama,
bigger than most and much, much
noisier, competently made but not really
very exciting.
It deals with one of the war’s last
desperate actions. The apparently de-
feated Germans marshal their forces
for an unexpected tank attack while
the complacent Americans are more
concerned with distributing adequate
Christmas dinners to their troops. The
script, which employs every bad old
war-film cliche, clearly regards the Ger-
mans’ application to the task in hand
as unsporting; efficiency is thoroughly
suspect.
Most of the cast (Fonda, Robert
Ryan, Telly Savalas) coast almost con-
temptuously through their roles; Robert
Shaw’s performance, with his battery
of actor’s tricks clearly visible on the
Cinerama screen, might be of value to
a student of acting.
The color camera under Robert
Mulligan’s direction is the star of
“Inside Daisy Clover,” a film which
is always beguiling and stimulating to
the eye even when it sags a bit
dramatically. Gavin Lambert himself
adapted his novel for the screen, and
for some reason has removed most of
its bite and its rough, slangy humor.
What is left is basically the standard
backstage fame-and-heartbreak story,
very acceptable as entertainment but
shallow in characterisation.
Natalie Wood is hardly the ideal
choice for the central role, though she
dances through the film quite charm-
ingly and looks as pretty as paint; but
she’s too gentle and soft to convey the
tough fibre of the girl who could go
through hell and still hang on to her
guttersnipe integrity. The rest of the
cast is extremely capable, and if a girl
is going to be done wrong by men I
can’t think of a more attractive pair of
betrayers than Christopher Plummer
and Robert Redford.
But it is Mulligan’s visual images
that remain in the mind—the studio
buildings looking as improbable as a
Martian city; the producer’s sumptuous,
sterile mansion; the bleak, lonely
beaches.
“Daisy Clover” may noL provide
much food for thought, but it surely is
a feast for the eye.

Sculpture Saturation
Transfield Sculpture Prize. Hyde Park,
Sydney.
ON review day the rain fell in finely
sculptured shafts; it cascaded from
bronze, steel, copper, aluminium,
and the six judges: like frogmen they
scrutinised the Redpath, the Lyle, the
Flugelman, and Boreham as though
these were strange, emerging marine
creatures, loose in the park.
Certainly sculpture, enjoying a minor
renaissance, is emerging, but maybe
the grey rain or the park’s forlorn
sundial, unable to measure the halcyon
hours, but jutting up in the special
pavilion, made me wonder if sculpture,
as it is, has not reached its apogee.
We saw a touring show in 1965, a
splendidly gay and intricate exhibition
by Klippel at the end of 1965, the
Alcorso-Sekers show in August, 1966,
the opening of the Canberra Sculpture
Centre in June, 1966, and a show by
Melbourne’s Centre Five. In 1967 will
come Mildura’s third triennial exhibi-
tion and sculpture will be a feature
of Perth’s, festival.
, Why, then, the misgivings? Too many
are too content with a static monumen-
tality or with a constructivism that
looks pre-built; too many look lacerated
and eroded, but the spirit that has
suffered such travail is lacking; too
many find modern modes comfortable.
Further, the catalogue prolegomenon
by a Harry D. Nicholson, 8.A., sug-
gests that the latest experiment in
kinetic sculpture and assemblages of
vulgar, plastic materials will not stand
the test of bronze, aluminium, and
steel. No need to point out that art
transforms and transcends its materials,
that it is not the bronze that creates
the sculpture, but there is need to note
that there is but one piece of colored
sculpture, that by Anthony Bishop, in
orange and red triangular prisms, four
pointing skywards and 16 horizontally,
four from each of four sides.
Colored sculpture, which made a fine
debut at the Alcorso-Sekers show with
Reinhard, Jprdan, Kitching, and the
brilliantly capricious piece by Bald-
essin, and which is epidemic in England
and America, has an air of frail gaiety
that would have counterpointed some
of the prevailing prim efficiency and
lugubrious power.

$2OOO, has done far better work. Her

success story:
Victa and GTV9 began their success
stories in Australia at about the same
time. It was in 1956 that GTV9 began
transmitting and the Victa became
Australia's top-selling mower.
Today GTV9 is one of Australia’s
highest-rating Television stations and
Victa is still Australia’s market leader.
In June this year Graham Kennedy
appeared in a special Victa commercial
on his GTV “In Melbourne Tonight"
show featuring the one millionth Victa
motor mower. It was one of the many
Victa commercials that will run on GTV
this year.
Victa has been one of GTV’s most
consistent advertisers. Victa is one of
Australia’s most successful companies.

It has little of the

Maureen Palmer’s
“Pioneer Woman,”
clad in sheet cop-
per, has no faith in
the modern world
and is placed with her back to it.
Insectoid and science-fiction crea-
tures are on the prowl: Lorraine Bore-
ham’s “Introvert” enterprisingly en-
cases dozens of sliced tubes in copper;
Leonard Shillam’s two cubist Martians
seem to be emerging from a radio tele-
scope and one hopes Parkes is alert;
Robert Owen has an assemblage of
pipes emerging from a box-like torso
and trying to be allegories of human
limbs.
Max Lyle and David Tolley made
positive contributions; both employ the
Melbourne style of bulbous, knobbly
proliferations from solid, often flat
form, in the manner of Baldessin.
Lyle’s “Integral Woman,” like a huge,
grey, web-footed and plucked fowl, pro-
liferates a disquieting right arm like a
zeppelin, and Tolley’s greenish rotundi-
ties grow naturally from a central slab.
Geoffrey Sharpies, in reclining balloon
shapes of beaten bronze, similarly
extols growth and internal pressure.
There are good examples of surface
laceration with Flugelman’s rough,
cast-iron horse and rider, where the
concave shapes looked as though carved
by ancient seas, and Ingel King’s im-
pacted, chaotic boxes in bronzed steel
on a thrusting trunk.
The one example of unpretentious
simplicity is a piece of serrated steel
by De Vere Tyndall, borrowed to fine
effect from Gonzales; but sculpture to
entice and lead the eye through inter-
stices and precarious planes comes in
the pale brown convolutions of
laminated paper by Dadswell, weaving
and twisting with a vigor no other
piece can equal, and in the white
plastic tubes that grow slowly through
layers of horizontal strips in Jomanta’s
“Sacrifice.”
Sacrifice, says the catalogue intro-
duction, is what sculptors make as
well as sculpture, and if life is short
and art is long sculpture must be
even longer; so one is loath to say
that what we have here, despite various
excellences, is generally a passing style.
However, a monument should remain
to it in the park, to challenge these
old frock-coated legislators who cer-
tainly are passe and to show that our
councillors are alive.

Commitment
The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s Window.
Lorraine Hansberry. New, Sydney.
Bandicoot on a Burnt Ridge. Marien
Dreyer. Studio 228, Sydney.
Lorraine hansberry dedi-
cated her play to “the commit-
ted everywhere,” and since, as
the program mentions, the New
Theatre is a “committed theatre” it
is not surprising that the company has
responded to “The Sign in Sidney
Brustein’s Window” with all the verve
and dedication which characterise
them at their best. Marie Armstrong’s
production, with an excellent cast, has
a professional confidence and compe-
tence.
The play is straight realism, but it
is written with wit, passion, and a free-
flowing rhetoric reminiscent of Edward
Albee. Lorraine Hansberry’s characters
are a colorful group of young bohe-
mians who include the Jew, Sidney
Brustein, a homosexual, a call-girl,
and a young man of mixed white and
Negro ancestry. Sidney Brustein declares
at the beginning that he is disillusioned
with fighting for causes, but he is soon
caught up in a local election campaign
in support of the candidate for
“reform” and “progress.” The sign in
his window is an election poster.
But “The Sign in Sidney Brustein’s
Window” is not a propagandist play.
It is probably a dramatic strength that
the playwright is more interested in
her characters and leaves her “com-
mitment” vague.
Peter Dyke gives a convincing and
intelligent performance in the very
demanding part of Sidney Brustein.
He is ably supported by Shirley Broad-
way, Evelyn Docker, and June Phillips
as the three sisters Parodus, by John
Rabbitts in an admirably restrained per-
formance as the young homosexual,
and by Colin Turner as Alton Scales,
the part-Negro youth.
In a dreary two-room flat in Kings
Cross, Les and Glad Baxter have been
existing you could not call it living
for the eighteen years since their
marriage just after World War 11.
Suddenly, vicarious excitement enters
their lives when the police set a watch
on the lighted window in the adjoin-
ing tenement, which is visible from
their living-room. There, behind the
permanently drawn blind, the Shadow
Strangler is thought to lurk. While the
police clump about on the roof, Les
and Glad get in beer and savories, ring
up their friends, and start having gay
social evenings for the first time in
their lives. Reporters telephone from
the newspapers and television stations
and Les and Glad prepare themselves
for fame and the reward.
“Bandicoot on a Burnt Ridge” is a
curiously mixed play, which begins as
low-keyed realism in the first act,
mutates into a neatly constructed and
rather macabre comedy thriller, and
finishes as full-blown melodrama. Of
the trinity I liked the macabre comedy
best. Marien Dreyer also reveals a
talent for strong dramatic effects com-
bined with a grim, almost Jacobean,
vision of life, but this is vitiated by her
devotion to flat realism: cups of tea,
burnt toast, and banal dialogue.
Suzanne Roux won the N.S.W.
Drama Festival prize for the best
amateur actress for her performance as
the unloved Glad. She is well supported
by Allan Penney as the unlovable Les.

Vanished Youth
Youth Concert. Sydney Symphony
Orchestra. Conductor, Gunnar Staern;
soloist, Stefania Woytowicz. Town
Hall.
THE final Youth Concert of Syd-
ney’s 1966 series found the Town
Hall barely half-filled, something
that might well have been expected
with exams on. It might be fairer to
them if there were no Youth Concerts
between late -August and early Decem-
ber. The poor attendance was parti-
cularly regrettable, as, this time, the
concert had been imaginatively pro-
grammed.
The guest conductor was Swedish
Gunnar Staern, a pleasant, youngish
man, who struck me as being entirely
inoffensive and rather undistinguished.
His contribution to a successful occa-
sion consisted mainly of a clear, firm
beat.
The event of the evening was a per-
formance of Britten’s “Les Illumina-
tions,” opus 18. The work, for high
voice and string orchestra, dates from
1939 and remains one of his finest
achievements. Nine poems by Rimbaud
form the basis for this composition, first
introduced to Sydney in the 1940 s by
Boyd Neel and heard again, three years
ago, under Mr. Post’s masterful direc-
tion, with tenor Peter Baillie. That
performance proved the wisdom of
employing a limited number of players
and a tenor rather than soprano. Mr.
Staern used the full string section of
over 40 players, and the Town Hall’s
acoustics co-operated by assuring a cer-
tain loss of clarity. The soloist was
visiting Polish soprano Stefania Woyto-
wicz, a magnificent singer with a big
voice and a rare ability for accurate
modulation.
In so,me of the lovely songs, Miss
Woytowicz’s voice seemed unduly
dramatic, but she did wonders in those
most in need of restraint. “Royaute,”
“Being Beauteous,” and “Depart” were
interpreted with considerable feeling. In
addition to the fine singing, there were

For the concert’s second half we
turned back to the 19th century to
Beethoven’s 7th Symphony. This music,
when first heard in my early teens,
made a lasting impression on me. This
performance by the SSO was so fine
that I hope it ,may have similarly im-
pressed some of the younger members
of the audience. Their attention was
sorely distracted by the presence of
three television cameras, special light-
ing, and the Beethovenesque rumblings-
of a violent thunderstorm. Over-
shadowing all these distractions, the
performance was a truly excellent one
and reflected great credit on the
orchestra. Though, in my observation
of his work, the conductor contributed
rather little to this success (he was
rather more effective in the Britten),
this is still greatly to be preferred to.

NABUCCO” was Verdi’s first great
triumph, which is now, after
many years of neglect, being regularly
revived with invariable success. Built
around a humdrum libretto based on
the biblical story of Nebuchadnezzar,
it may not have the polish of Verdi’s
later works but contains many lengthy
scenes of brilliantly sustained melody.
“Nabucco” set the pattern, later fol-
lowed in “Macbeth” and “Rigoletto”
right through to “Falstaff,” of building
the music around a high baritone.
George Bernard Shaw claimed that
these roles ruined the voice and, in his
day, he was right. The fact that they
are now sung year in and year out by
the same singers without apparent harm
is an interesting reflection on today’s
singing standards, said to be so inferior
to those of Shaw’s day.
Decca have accepted Verdi’s own
valuation by building the new recording
around Tito Gobbi, an expensive star
name. The rest of the cast appears to
have been chosen for economic rather
than artistic reasons. All the more sur-
prising, then, to report that the still
excellent Gobbi is eclipsed by a new-
comer, Elena Suliotis, aged only 22,
who gives an astonishing display of
vocal bravura. One must look back to

promising debut at a comparative age.
The part of Abigaile belongs to the
great Aidas and Leonoras. The young
Greek-Russian soprano from the Argen-
tine breezes through it with absolute
assurance, both vocally and dramati-
cally. The tenor, Bruno Prevedi, is
good enough, but Carlo Cava, in the
important part of Zaccaria, is not up to
scratch, and Dora Carral’s engagement
for Fenena is incomprehensible. A
pity, because otherwise this is an exci-
ting set in every way.
That anyone could have anything
new to say about the so-called “immor-
tal twins,” Cav and Pag, would seem
impossible. But the new Deutsche
Grammophon recording is a tour de
force by Karajan, who convincingly
demonstrates that they contain aspects
not previously known to exist. I must
admit to a past liking for the slap-
dash shouting-matches which seemed
so appropriate to these verismo pion-
eers; but then I had never heard them
performed like this. Karajan’s inter-
pretations are totally unlike any I have
heard in 35 years of opera-going. His
tempi are slow, too slow one thinks
at first, but after a few minutes whole
new vistas of previously unknown
beauties are revealed and I am sure
only the most stubborn stick-in-the-
mud will refuse to be convinced.
casts of both operas are excel-
lent, though there are weaknesses.
Carlo Bergonzi stars as Turiddu and
Canio, making lightweight characters
of them. Under Karajan’s baton any
other way would have, been ludicrous,
and his superb control from pianissimo
to forte (if never fortissimo) is a tre-
mendous asset. His Nedda is a young
English soprano, Joan Carlyle, who was
engaged at 24 hours’ notice when the
original Nedda fell ill. Miss Carlyle
is an impressive addition to the roster
of major recording artists. She has a
well-placed flexible voice which records
superbly. Any failings are very minor
indeed. Rolando Panerai (Silvio) and
Ugo Benelli (Beppe) are also very fine.
Giuseppe Taddei has been one of the
best baritones of the century. Unhap-
pily, the accent must be on the “has
been.” His Tonio is a great perform-
ance, magnificently acted, but the
imminent loss of vocal control, again
and again avoided miraculously by
sheer musicianship, makes for uncom-
fortable listening.
In “Cavalleria Rusticana,” Giangia-
como Guelfi’s Alfio has none of these
worries; his magnificent baritone leaves
a big impression on a usually thankless
part. Fiorenza Cossotto’s voice is
equally superb and steady as a rock.
Yet her Santuzza’s is the only perform-
ance which does not take to Karajan’s
treatment; she would have been happier
in a more conventional performance.
The recording, as in all DGG sets, does
not have the stage immediacy of the
Decca treatment. Yet is is superb in
a different way and I recommend these
performances as by far the best avail-
able in every way.

ON FILM
Reliving the Golden Years
BILL COLLINS, who possibly
knows more about American films
than anyone else in Australia, has
recently been given his head by TCN
to select a year or more of old movies
for showing late on Saturday nights in
Sydney. An enviable assignment: Mr.
Collins’ purpose is to illustrate the
work of certain key directors of the
19305, most notably John Ford, Michael
Curtiz, and Henry King, perhaps the
three most distinguished craftsmen of
that era, in a series called “The Golden
Years of Hollywood.”
“I want to cast the net as wide as
possible,” Mr. Collins said. “I haven’t
necessarily aimed at the biggest films of
a specific ’thirties director, but rather
A scene from “Dante’s Inferno,” with
Spencer Tracy.
have striven to show them at their most
typical.” For instance, Lloyd Bacon, a
director known for his fast-moving
musicals, was represented by “42nd
Street,” a brilliant evocation of the
hard work and sheer nervous tension
that go on behind the supposedly
“glamorous” world of the New York
theatre. The film, charmingly dated,
featured a monocled Ginger Rogers as
a haughty chorine, the engagingly
athletic Ruby Keeler, and the bel-
ligerent Warner Baxter (the last two
virtually forgotten names), while Busby
Berkeley electrifyingly staged the musi-
cal numbers. Berkeley, a kind of genius
of pop-art vulgarity, is again to be
shown in his full colors in “Dames,”
another backstage story, and “Gold
Diggers of 1933,” one of his most ex-
travagant achievements. He formed his
cohorts of chorus girls into diamonds,
exploding waterlilies, pyramids, and
cauliflowers like a combination of a
mad geometrician and a prizewinning
flower-show artist.
• In direct contrast with the “Golden
Years’ ” tinny madcap musicals are the
“solid” dramas: a remake of the famous
Janet Gaynor weepie “Seventh
Heaven,” Edmund Gouldings’ “White
Banners,” and Howard Hawks’ “The
Road to Glory,” from a Faulkner
script. Perhaps the two weirdest items
on the list are what must be the first
full-length silent feature shown on TV,
“Noah’s Ark” (which should make in-
interesting contrast with John Huston’s
“The Bible”), and “Dante’s Inferno,”
which one gathers looks like a series of
Dore illustrations recast by an artist
from “Vanity Fair.”
One good item is “Mandalay,” dir-
ected by Michael Curtiz. Set in a wholly
mythical Burma, starring the marvel-
lous Kay Francis, this is a lush example
of exotica, full of whirling fans, heat,
sweat, and rippling shadows.
I should like to urge upon Mr. Col-
lins and TCN, “Young Mr. Lincoln,”
John Ford’s most beautiful film, Wil-
liam Wyler’s and Bette Davis’ finest
masterpiece, “The Letter,” G. W.
Pabst’s only American film, “A Modern
Hero,” Wilhelm Dieterle’s “Mme Du
Barry” with Dolores del Rio, and Otto
Preminger’s small-town melodrama
“Fallen Angel.”
Perhaps most of all I should like to
see a series of Fox musicals, led by the
marvellously vulgar Carmen Miranda-
Alice Faye series. The “Golden Years”
got off to a rousing start with one of
the Fayes: “Hollywood Cavalcade.”
This story of a director a cross be-
tween Mack Sennett, Erich von Stro-
heim, and Josef von Sternberg and
his rise to success in the Hollywood
period of silent and early sound was
brilliantly directed by Irving Cum-
mings and acted by Don Ameche and
Alice Faye. The film never puts a foot
wrong: one recalls especially the trial
run of a silent comedy, the solemn
custard-pie throwing mute against the
sustained rattling whine of the projec-
tor; the gigantic studio birthday party,
Don Ameche and Alice Faye in “Holly-
wood Cavalcade.”
beginning with a close-up of a birthday
cake and a period version of “My Blue
Heaven,” the camera tracking across
potted palms behind the band to take
in a mammoth sound-stage dance;
the bathing-beauty scene at the beach,
featuring the Wampus baby stars, and
“By the Beautiful Sea,” played on the
sound-track; and, above all, the late
silent picture shot at Malibu, three
horses riding across a sun-dappled lake.

LIFE ABROAD
A SHORT STORY BY PETER SHRUBB
SHE mothers us,” Katie wrote home
to Sydney, “but that seems a small
price to pay. Anne, for instance
(remember her?—the girl we met on
board), walked practically straight off
the boat train into a lovely sort of
Georgian place just up behind Kensing-
ton High Street but her landlady!
Napoleon reincarnated! Sleeps about
one hour a night, simply lusts for
power, and is utterly invincible. Poor
Anne missed the last bus home from
our place last week (the English have
this marvellous system worked out of
starting plays and concerts before any-
one has had time to eat, and stopping
all public transport about one minute
after the theatres come out—because it
saved gas or coal or something in 1943!)
and the poor thing had to stay the night
with us, on a tiny camp bed sort of
thing Mrs. Cox lent us —she’s really
very kind —lying with her feet under
the kitchen table and her head practi-
cally under the sink, and so frightened
about how she was going to explain
to Bonaparte where she had spent the
night and why that she might as well
have been on the rack. She looked like
a criminal caught absolutely in flagrante
delicto or medias res or whatever it is
when she set off home next morning!
“Anyhow, I must off. In about ten
minutes, unless the great laws of nature
change, Mrs. Cox is going to call out,
‘Oh, Mrs. Elliot, are you in?’ and not
take no for an answer. Morning tea
will be performed. So off I go with my
little shopping cart, my scarf over my
head, and my fleecy-lined boots on, to
cast a knowing eye over the kippers.
I know you must be smiling, Mummy—
but really I think I’m doing quite well
at this housewife business. We’re thriv-
ing, anyway. And Andrew says he gets
as much experience in a day’s Secondary
Modern as he would in a year in Aus-
tralia. Not always pleasant experience,
though—education a la Marquess of
Queensberry, it sometimes sounds like!
“Eeek. Too late! Tea’s on! Love to
you all.”
Mrs. Cox’s wrinkled brown hand
trembled gently as she poured, but
nothing spilled. “Such a pretty blue
these cups are, I always think,” she said
as she served Katie two sweet biscuits.
“Like a summer sky.”
“Gorgeous,” Katie said.
It seemed an incongruous word in
Mrs. Cox’s warm dark parlor. Wintry
sun palely lit the single window giving
on to a backyard so small that, looking
down on it from the kitchen window of
her upstairs flat, Katie had formulated
theories to account for the English
obsession with miniatures, with toys and
trimness; but where she sat with her
hostess, at a small table with scroll
feet and a red laminated plastic top,
only a faint nimbus touched the oval-
framed photographs on the mantelpiece
and the leadlighted front of the tall
dresser. Often, after she had been in
the room for a time, Katie shuddered.
Mrs. Cox had led a sad, troubled life,
however, and in her landlady’s presence,-
faced with the suffering that grey hair
and half-blind, awkward movements
spoke of, Katie felt her heart soften;
she was willing to say the cups were
gorgeous. But she held her airletter
prominently in one hand as she took her
first sip of tea, and was delighted to
find it cool enough for the sip to be
made a gulp. “Tea,” she said. “Tea.
I knew there was something I’d for-
gotten to put on my list.” She looked
up, and said what she knew would
please Mrs. Cox. “Don’t you let me go
without making sure I write it in, will
you?”
Mrs. Cox beamed a little, and put
her hands round the warm teapot. “I
ought to start making lists again myself.
Being all alone, I’ve needed so little.
But, oh, wasn’t I the efficient one, too,
when I was first married! I had neat
ways of doing everything!” She looked
down. “Too neat, perhaps.”
W HAT had happened to Mr. Cox,
Katie did not yet know, and did
not want to be held up long enough
to find out. So she quickly said, “An-
drew insists. And really, : he’s perfectly
right—without a list, I’d buy marvel-
lous foreign things and no sugar.”
“Or tea,” said Mrs. Cox, smiling
wanly.
Katie clapped her hand to her mouth.
Then, with an exaggeratedly purposeful
air, she scrabbled in her handbag for
her shopping list, and firmly printed
TEA on it in capital letters. “There!”
“As long as you don’t forget to look
at your list,” Mrs. Cox said.
Katie giggled. “You’ll have me tying
bits of string round my fingers in a
minute. No,” she said, standing up.
“Now, while it’s all still fresh in my
mind, I’d better stagger off and start
frittering away the family fortunes.”
She picked up her bag. “Is there any-
thing I can get you while I’m on the
job? Just this once?” She made herself
sound cajoling. “A little tea, perhaps? A
little tin of Ceylon tea? I drink up such
a lot of yours, you know.” Feeling a
twinge of guilt at having drunk it up
so quickly that morning, Katie very
lightly touched Mrs. Cox on the shoul-
der. “Please.”
To her astonishment, Mrs. Cox burst
into tears. Her head fell forward, her
hands went to her face, her shoulders
slumped, and muffled wet sobs
destroyed the tea-time peace.
Katie drew back her hand in fright,
half thinking at first that perhaps she
had hurt Mrs. Cox physically. Mrs. Cox
was crying from sorrow, though, not
from pain, and seeing this, Katie nerved
herself to touch her again. But before
she could screw up courage enough
Mrs. Cox bravely lifted her head,
sniffled a little, dabbed her eyes, and
even tried to smile.
Very relieved, Katie smiled back.
“Are you all right?” she asked gently.
Mrs. Cox did not answer. She seemed
still in the grip of her sudden agitation.
Embarrassed half smiles twisted her soft
mouth as she wiped and wiped her
thick glasses; she made efforts to
straighten her shoulders, and tried un-
successfully to brush back from her face
a wisp of hair.
“Are you all right now?” Katie asked
again. This time she either trembled or
shuddered, and her voice shook a little.
Mrs. Cox put her glasses on, and
looked up. “I’m sorry, my dear,” she
said. But saying this undid her; her
hands went to her face again, and her
shoulders shook.
Katie bent down over her. “There
must be something wrong, Mrs. Cox.
Please tell me.” She found it hard to
keep exasperation out of her voice.
“Please.”
Mrs. Cox at first shook her head, say-
ing nothing; but a moment later she
wiped her eyes again, firmly, and then
stuffed the handkerchief into the sleeve
of her cardigan, and folded her hands
in her lap. “I’m being very silly,” she
said.
With a sigh, Katie sat down again.
“If only you’d tell me what has hap-


pened. Was it something I said? If I
said anything—”
Mrs. Cox held one hand up as if to
stop Katie’s mouth with it. “Oh, no!”
she cried. “You were kind!” To this
Katie could say nothing, but in any
case Mrs. Cox’s hand was still up. “You
were kind!” She went on more quietly.
“It is such a long time . . .” she started.
Then she hesitated and finished lamely
with, “You reminded me.” Appar-
ently sensing Katie’s perplexity, she
looked up, blushed, and, as if apologis-
ing, said, “Mr. Porter has proposed to
me, you see.”
The revulsion that thickened Katie’s
throat, and for a moment prevented
her from replying, also embarrassed
her deeply, and she put her hand to
her mouth and coughed to hide it. Mr.
Porter, who rented Mrs. Cox’s front
room downstairs, was a gross man, un-
clean, sinister. One evening, as Katie
came home from the library, he had
stopped her at the foot of the stairs
and asked her in his slow, thick voice
if she could tell him anything about an
old book he had bought from a stall
near the Chalk Farm Underground. In
the dim light of Mrs. Cox’s narrow hall-
way he had shown her the book, which
was battered and broken-backed, miss-
ing both covers and title page, ragged,
and stained; then, with his eyes full of
meaning, he opened it for her at a
place he had kept marked with his
thumb. On one page were stanzas of
poetry in Italian, and on the other
there was an illustration, an etching, in
which scores of naked human figures
writhed and squirmed in grotesque
torment. When Katie looked up from
it, Mr. Porter was smiling at her and
it was obvious to her that what he
meant by showing her the book was
nakedness. His lined, fat face was shiny
and grimy, his pale blue eyes were
half hooded, and his parted lips showed
crooked brown teeth. His shirt was
dirty, his tie was loose, and the grease-
thickened lapels of his double-breasted
blue suit curled forward as if they, too,
were leering at her.
• H e S a good man,” Mrs. Cox said.
“And he hasn’t had an easy life.
Any more than I have.” She paused.
“But it’s such a long time . . .”
The silence extended, but Katie could
think of nothing to say. That Mrs. Cox
should marry anyone seemed impos-
sible; that she should marry Mr. Porter
was unimaginable. In any case, really,
it was none of her business; the decision
was Mrs. Cox’s to make, and so pro-
foundly personal a one no one else
could help her establish its terms of
reference even, let alone give positive
advice. But perhaps it would help Mrs.
if she simply listened. So Katie sat
and waited.
“He, too, has lost a loved one,” Mrs.
Cox said. “Not, of course, that he has
told me anything about the first Mrs.
Porter himself; but we’ve been to see
his mother a couple of times what a
wonderful old lady she is, too and
she told me while Fred was out. It was
a growth, of course. Fred nearly died
himself, she said, inside. But outside
well, the doctor himself said he
never had seen a nurse as good as Fred.
I believe it. And what he hasn’t sacri-
ficed for his mother!”
Katie felt that now she had to say
something. “Do you love him, Mrs.
Cox?” she asked. It came out in rather
a desperate way and she blushed to
hear herself.
Mrs. Cox blushed, too. Then they
saw one another and smiled and then
laughed. Mrs. Cox’s little grey head
went back, her glasses flashed, and her
tinkling, cracked laugh played treble
to Katie's breathy, embarrassed giggle.
But in the still, dark little room there
had to be more reason for laughter
than they had, and in a moment or two
they stopped.
“Love,” said Mrs. Cox. “Well . . .”
“I really think that, in the long run,
it’s all that matters,” Katie said earn-
estly. She carefully kept from her voice
any intonation that might suggest that
loving Mr. Porter was unimaginable
for without disbelieving what Mrs. Cox
had told her about him, she neverthe-
less could not disbelieve what she knew,
that Mr. Porter was lickerish and dirty.
“My husband left me after exactly
one year,” Mrs. Cox said. “I loved
him, and until the very day he left me
the note to say he was going right
here, right here on this table I found
it when I came back from shopping
I thought he loved me. I nearly died.
Love,” she said. “Love’s not every-
thing.”
Obviously, Katie thought, it was not
love that Mr. Cox had felt; otherwise
he would not have left her. But to Mrs.
Cox she could not voice this thought,
of course; and even less was she free
to suggest to Mrs. Cox that only a
person starved of real affection would
burst into tears at being lightly touched
with kindness. “It’s not everything, I
agree,” she said. “Nothing’s everything.
But surely your own experience shows
how very important it is.”
“What he feels is probably more im-
portant than what I feel,” Mrs. Cox
said a little bitterly. “That’s what my
expei'ience shows.”
Katie said nothing to this. The situ-
ation Mrs. Cox’s attitude fitted best was
prostitution, but there was only every-
thing to lose by voicing that opinion.
To speak without voicing it, however, ‘
would have been somehow immoral;
so she said nothing, hoping that her
silence would speak for itself.
“But don’t you worry, dear,” Mrs.
Cox said comfortingly, patting the air
with her hand. “I’ll snap out of it, as
they say.” Her glasses glinted as she
twisted in her chair to smile at Katie.
“I’ll be all right. Don’t you worry.
It’ll all come right in the end.” She
put her hands around the teapot. “Too
cold now,” she said. “What I think
I’d better do is make us another cup
of tea. There’s nothing like a cup of
tea.”
Katie stood up. “I really think I’d
better be off before I give in to tempta-
tion again,” she said. “And I must get
this letter into the post or it might miss
the plane tomorrow,” she lied.
“Mummy will begin to wonder what’s
happened to me.” She picked up her
bag. “Why don’t you let me do your
shopping for you? Then you could sit
back with that cup of tea and not have
to gulp it down and then hurry off to
the shops.” She smiled. “This is where
I came in, isn’t it?”
Mrs. Cox laughed this time and
Katie, remembering her tears of only
a few minutes before, felt that the time
she had spent with her landlady that
morning had not been wasted. “Come
on,” she said. “No arguments. Give
me your list and I’ll be off.”
“You’re a bully,” Mrs. Cox said. But
she opened a drawer in the dresser,
took out a little writing-pad, and tore
off the front sheet. She quickly
scribbled a few words on it, folded it
carefully, and handed it to Katie. For
some reason Katie could not under-
stand, she blushed as she did this.
“There you are, dear,” she said. “Off
you go and thank you very much.
You’re very good to me.”
J£ATIE closed Mrs. Cox’s front door
behind her, and freedom and the
bright air so exhilarated her that
when she reached the footpath and
saw in the distance 'the grey roof of
Andrew’s school she blew it a kiss,
and astonished herself. She smiled,
and blushed, and felt warmth fill her.
She thought of Mrs. Cox, shook her
head to clear the thought away, and
remembered that Andrew had a half
holiday and would be home for lunch,
before her if she did not hurry. She
started off down the hill at almost
a run.
The huge brown buds on the chest-
nuts danced slowly and sedately up
and down in the wind that met her at
the first corner. The park she and
Andrew already had the habit of spend-
ing Sunday mornings in was at the
end of that street. It was a park full
of surprises; today spring buds made
the air in it seem a different color,
and Katie crossed the street slowly,
wondering at it. She remembered the
shock of first walking into it, only a
month or two ago. Under the half
dozen immense elms that stood in
mountainous towering stillness opposite
the gate, three men and a boy armed
with birch brooms were tidying a huge
pile of autumn leaves. Elm, poplar,
beech, oak, chestnut and birch were all
mixed together—Andrew identified
them in his Observer’s Book of Trees,
bought for that very purpose, that same
night, and guessed that the leaves
would be used as mulch when spring
came. The pile was thirty yards long
and thirty yards wide and five or six
feet high; it.was the sheer size of it
that made Katie gasp. A clump of
gums shaded her parents’ backyard,
and in the street jacarandas dropped
their purple flowers and tiny yellow
leaflets, but nothing at home had pre-
pared her for the fecundity of Eng-
land. The trees, the marvellous trees
of England! At the next corner she


turned down toward the shops, and
almost bumped into Mr. Porter.
“Hullo!” he said, near her face, turn-
ing to talk.
“I nearly walked right into you!”
Katie cried, with a little laugh, but
keeping herself sideways to him to
show she was pausing, not stopping.
“I’m so sorry.”
Mr. Porter smiled, seemed to glares
and then smiled again. “Worse things
have happened to me,” he said. “Much
worse.”
Katie thought she knew what he
meant, but then remembered his wife,
and was contrite. “You’re not home
early because of sickness, I hope, are
you?” she asked. It seemed too inti-
mate a question, the moment she asked
it, and while waiting for his reply she
hated him. Hating him made her feel
a child, though, and she tried to smile.
“I’m fortunate enough to be self-
employed, Mrs. Elliot,” he announced.
“I can suit my own convenience in
most things, I’m thankful to say.”
“You’re very lucky there,” Katie
interposed.
Mr. Porter laughed, and when he
lifted his chin the blackheads in the
wrinkles in his neck showed clearly.
“It wasn’t done by luck, my dear,” he
chortled. “Bad luck, more likely! Bad
luck will put you on your toes!” But
then, as if he felt he had been too
severe, he looked down again, almost
not smiling.
This kindness in him Katie brushed
aside because he had laughed at her,
and because he was dirty. She simply
said nothing, having learnt that this
hurt people; she looked at him as if
she were waiting for him to finish, as
if what he had said did not yet make
sense.
Almost immediately, Mr. Porter said,
“I didn’t mean you, of course. I
didn’t mean that you needed to be put
on your toes, my dear. Nothing per-
sonal.”
Having won, Katie broke off the
battle. But instead of being cool, she
was comforting. She said, “I know
you didn’t, Mr. Porter, I didn’t think
that for a minute.” Feeling a fool,
she added, “And now I really must
be off and do my shopping, or we
won’t eat tonight,” and turned on her
heel and hurried away.
Mrs. Cox’s angular scribblings were
only fairly legible, but Katie was able
Jo make them out except one, which
looked something like caviar, or per-
haps cdustic (small), and had to be
left undeciphered. Taking advantage of
specials in tea and detergent, she was
able to bring Mrs. Cox’s expenditure
down to thirteen and tenpence.
Halfway up the hill on the way home
her virtue and good works were, she
felt, properly rewarded. A hand stole
round her waist from behind, and she
had barely time to think of Mr. Porter
before Andrew’s voice whispered,
“You’re the sort of girl that drives
men mad, I tell you, mad.”
All the parts of her dislodged and
disordered by the efforts and disap-
pointments of the morning suddenly
fell back into place; all the contradic-
tions dissolved. “You say that to all the
girls, I bet,” she replied mincingly,
taking the hoyden part he had- offered
her and glad to be free of her troubled
self. For answer, Andrew pinched her
bottom.
ir pHIS, in public, she was not sure she
liked, but she made no complaint
and they walked up the hill arm in
arm like an old married couple. In a
minute Katie was telling the story of
her morning, and Andrew was suitably
amazed at the possible union of Mr.
Porter and Mrs. Cox. Katie cried, “How
could she love him!” Andrew, though
he knew nothing of Mr. Porter’s use of
Dante, knew enough to agree with her.
They had both speculated about the fre-
quency with which Mr. Porter bathed,
and they speculated again. Katie shud-
dered.
It was a pleasure then, she found, to
stop gossiping and walk up the hill in
silence. With Andrew’s arm in hers,
everything around her always seemed to
mean more. An oppressive weight of
meaning it was, though, in England,
a rich, heavy mulch of English lives;
“Remember, headshrinking is an art —not to be confused with psychiatry."
she was glad not to be a part of it.
Today, toiling uphill, she looked down
at the cracks in the footpath and won-
dered who had laid the path. Dead in
the war perhaps, but not erased, not
hopelessly gone or forgotten. One day
years ago they had climbed out of their
old truck, dropped their heavy tools,
their brazier and their tar near the foot
of a young chestnut, changed the face of
the earth a little, and then had gone off
home, joking, or perhaps tired and
quiet. What their hands had made now
touched her, and what they did now
changed what she did. Perhaps in the
tar even the perspiration of their bodies
still lay locked.
She looked up and decided it would
be nice to have a baby. A distant drift
of thin cloud set off the light, bright
blue of the sky, beneath which the
chestnut buds danced and nodded a
few feet over her head. From the gar-
den they were passing came momen-
tarily some thick northern fragrance.
In her mind’s eye she saw a baby just
like Andrew, with a fine-featured lean
face and straight long legs and a flat
stomach, and she smiled at her own
foolishness. But the idea survived the
smile. The two-storeyed semi-detached
houses in that street hid many children;
their tiny clothes waved on washing-
lines and their cars and bicycles made
yards untidy. Katie wondered whether
Mrs. Cox would permit a baby and
decided that she would, but that Mr.
Porter might not. She sighed.
Mrs. Cox popped her head out of the
kitchen the moment they stepped in-
side and came toward them, smiling, to
collect her groceries. Katie apologised
for not having been able to read the
entry that seemed to say caviar, and
offered to go back for it straight away
if it was something Mrs. Cox urgently
needed.
With a slightly queer smile on her
face, Mrs. Cox peered in her half-blind
way at Katie and said, “It was caviar,
Mrs. Elliot. But don’t you even dream
of going back for it; you’ve done more
than your due already.” There was
something ambiguous in her tone that
made Katie blush with both embarrass-
ment and fear. Mrs. Cox had obviously
drawn her own conclusions about
Katie’s default.
Now Katie remembered the blush,
with which Mrs. Cox had handed her
the folded paper. That, surely, was
warrant for the mistake; not only did
she herself think, but so apparently did
Mrs. Cox also, that there was an obvi-
ous incongruity in the association of
caviar with Mrs. Cox. And now, inno-
cent again, she was angry at having
been made to suffer embarrassment. But
she said, “I’m sorry, Mrs. Cox.” But
she added, “I didn’t realise you were
celebrating.”
Mrs. Cox didn’t mind that; in fact,
she smiled mischievously, and Katie
wondered if perhaps her coolness of
a moment before had not been merely
the product of disappointment rather
than of hurt pride. But just then
Mr. Porter came out of the kitchen


into the hall to join them. With a sort
of open joviality in her voice that Katie
had not heard there before, Mrs. Cox
cried, “If you still want that caviar,
Fred, I’m afraid you’ll have to get it
yourself!” While Mr. Porter smiled and
shook in a jolly, fat way, the misunder-
standing was explained to him, and,
with jokes about how good a doctor
Mrs. Cox would be with her bad hand-
writing, fatuously enlarged upon.
Katie tried to smile, but could not.
Mrs. Cox must have decided to accept
Mr. Porter’s proposal before she handed
Katie the shopping list. But how long
before? Why had she asked Katie’s
advice?
She had not asked for advice. Katie’s
blood ran cold at the thought that she
had so intruded on Mrs. Cox’s privacy
as to give advice unasked for. She
hastily tried to remember what she had
said, how far she had been wrong.
And she was even able to manage a
smile at something Mr. Porter said when
she decided that all she had done was
ask Mrs. Cox if she loved him. Was
that too far? Perhaps Mrs. Cox hadn’t
thought so; she certainly hadn’t seemed
to.
But then why, if she had already
decided, had she wept? Merely at the
momentousness of the decision she had
taken? At the memory of her first
marriage, and its end? At the thought
of love? At the thought of lack of
love?
For a moment, watching them, Katie
felt her sense of self falter; they seemed
creatures of another world and she
would never understand them —neither
them nor the passionless, calculating,
deliberate England that produced
marriages like the one they were plan-
ning.
“Andrew,” she said, a little more
urgently than she had meant to, “we
must go.” She had interrupted them,
and they looked at her with momen-
tary surprise. “We mustn’t keep Mrs.
Cox and Mr. Porter' standing out here
all morning. Come on up and help
me with lunch.”
“If it’s help with the eating, Mrs.
Elliot,” Mr.' Porter said with a laugh,
“I’m sure he’ll not need to be asked
twice!”
Katie did not bother to answer him;
that he should presume to answer for
her husband was an impertinence the
only reply to which could be silence.
But it was not a mode of reply that
suited her well, and as she continued
waiting for Andrew’s answer she felt her
face go stiff and unnatural. “Anyhow,”
she said hurriedly, “I must be off, my-
self, or it’ll never get done.” Without
another word, she turned and quickly
trotted up the stairs to the flat.
It was nearly ten minutes before
Andrew joined her; she heard them
laughing.
“How can you bear to go on talking
and talking to them like that?” Katie
asked him as he stepped into their
cramped kitchen. He came in smiling,
but at her challenge his smile went.
Her heart sank. But at that she was
angry again; too often, that day, she
had seen her words turn false to her
intention and become darts. It was
not just. So, hurt and angry, instead of
stopping, she went on. “How can you
bear to talk with that horrible man?
I’ve never told you what he did once
to me, but even without that, you
should . . .”
“Did to you?” Andrew broke in.
“What did he do to you?”
Katie told him of her meeting on
the stairs with Mr. Porter and his
edition of Dante. At the end of it,
Andrew waited, and then said, “Is that
all? Is that what you call doing some-
thing?”
“Of course it is!” she expostulated.
“What do you expect? A rape on the
stairs? Is that what you want?”
Smiling in a way she knew she loved,
Andrew took a big step toward her
and said, “I know what I want.” But
she thrust him away hard. She said.
“I’m not amused, even if you are,” and
turned away from him, back to the sink.
Andrew said nothing. But he was a
little glum, and sat with a glum thump
on the edge of their creaking kitchen
table.
“You’ll break it one day,” Katie said
over her shoulder.
Like a child, Andrew pushed him-
self on to the table again and made
it creak.
Katie banged the knife down angrily
and turned around. “It was ’awful!”
she said. “He’s an awful man, and if
I’d given him any opportunity at all
I don’t know what he would have
done!”
“That’s exactly it,” Andrew said
firmly. “You don’t know. Anyway, why
shouldn’t Mr. Porter find you attrac-
tive?”
“You’re admitting I was right, then!”
folded his arms tetchily.
“You don’t want to rape every girl
you find attractive, for heaven’s sake.”
Katie hated hearing him say “you”
in that way; but at the very moment
jealousy clutched her heart she also
felt it flood with love for him. Sitting
there lithe and relaxed, with his hair
just a little tousled, with thought dark-
ening his fine, lean face, no one could
have been handsomer. He said, “You’ve
just told me something you didn’t tell
me when it happened. Remember last
week when Anne had to stay the night
with us?”
Katie nodcjed.
“Well, I woke up about two o’clock
in the morning and couldn’t get back
to sleep, and couldn’t lie still, and I
got up because I thought I’d wake
you, too. I forgot all about Anne till
I practically fell over her in the kitchen.
Right here. I .ended up lying right on
top of her. How you slept through it I
will never know.” He stopped.
Katie waited, with stupid panic rising
like a whirlwind inside her, but he
did not continue. “And then what hap-
pened?’ she asked at last. He had a
guilty, regretful look on his face now.
Katie remembered the guilty hurry in
which Anne had left the following
morning.
“Nothing,” Andrew said slowly. “We
talked.” He looked up, smiling a
little. “I got off, I mean, and then we
talked a while. And then I went back
to bed.”
“Why didn’t you tell me before?”
“I don’t really know. Because I
thought you wouldn’t like the idea of
my talking to her in the dark in the
middle of the night.”
“In the dark? Why in the dark?” '
“Well, she only had her underclothes
on, of course!” Andrew waved one hand
in the air exasperatedly. “Why do you
.think?”
“Why didn’t she tell me anything
about it?”
“Same reason, I suppose. Embarrass-
ment. If we’d told you, you would
for certain have thought we were trying
to hide something.”
It was his saying “we” that made
Katie quite sure something had hap-
pened which he had still not told her.
How much had they touched one
another in that tangle of bodies? Had
he put out his hand to help her in case
he had hurt her? Had she had to hold
him? How did he know she had only
her underclothes on?
“You look as if you’re thinking the
most terrible things,” Andrew said
quietly. “I’m sorry I told you. I knew
I was right about not telling you.”
“Why did you tell me?” Katie asked.
“Why did you suddenly have to tell
me now, a week later?”
Andrew, too, spoke faster. “Just to
show you that a person can be at-
tracted to someone without being a
monster, or evil, or something.”
“In other words,” Katie said, “you
were attracted to Anne.” Without
knowing why, she took off her apron
and laid it on the dry end of the sink.
“Something happened that night that
you haven’t told me. What was it? Did
you make love to her or something?”
Andrew blushed. “No, I did not.
Not even or something.”
“This is too utterly stupid for words,”
Katie said, turning away from him
again to the door. She was horrified to
find then that it was not quite shut,
and that therefore Mrs. Cox and Mr.
Porter might have heard at least some
or all that had been said since Andrew
had come upstairs; even some was too
much. But then she was disgusted with
herself for caring about what was obvi-
ously of much less importance than
what had been said. Were her values so
suburban and superficial? Did she care
for the wrong things? She suddenly
felt that almost everything she did was
not yet real. “I must go and post this
letter to Mummy. I forgot it earlier,”
she said, and burst into tears, thinking 1
what a child she was.
Andrew put his hand on her shoul-
der; she shook it off, but he put it on
again and she let it stay. “Don’t cry,”
he said.
For a minute, though, she did. Then
she said, “Poor Anne.” They both sat
for a while at this, not saying anything
till it was time for lunch.


BOOKS
Death in the Morning
By DAVID MARTIN
Papa Hemingway. A. E. Hotchner.
Weidenfeld and Nicolson. $5.45.
GOING back over my notes on this
book I find that they fall into
three parts. They open with ex-
pletives and condemnations, with
queries and comments like these: Did
Hemingway speak as he wrote? Save us
from our friends! Worthless: another
name-dropping feast . . . Such as
Eckerman would put us off Goethe . . .
Marlene Dietrich couldn’t have talked
this way to save her life . . . Who wants
to know what a sweet teacher of the art
of marlin-fishing E.H. was . . . All this
Paris detail, and the capture of the
Ritz, not again! A shame to make a
Munchausen of him. And so on, in
plenty.
There follows a page of observations
in a different key. Notes on stories and
incidents I had not heard before and
which might interest the reader. E.H.
throttling pigeons in the Luxembourg
gardens to feed his son, Mr. Bumby.
E.H. and the lion cub defecating in a
Paris bar. E.H. and Hotchner at
Auteuil, smelling the horses to pick
winners. E.H. not in the Caporetto
retreat. E.H. “inspired” to start “A
Farewell to Arms” as the result of a
blood-letting he received when a friend
pulled the skylight cord instead of the
lavatory chain. Manuscript of “Across
the River” nearly lost by Hotchner.
Staff at the Closerie des Lilas clubs to-
gether to save E.H. from forfeiting
deposit on Miro painting . . . Bright
anecdotes, some illuminating, mostly
worth telling. At this stage my opinion
was beginning to change: not an im-
portant book, but maybe it had some-
thing.
The third set of notes are again dif-
ferent. They deal with the section of
■“Papa Hemingway” which recounts the
mounting tragedy of his decline. They
mainly ask questions. Can a man live
himself to death? How do his misfor-
tunes relate to his childhood, his father’s
suicide, the disguised misery of his
hatred for his mother? What part be-
longs to his_, on the whole unhappy,
ties with the magazine world? Does
my own belief a common and com-
monplace one that he feared death
all his days, until he had to make the
direct experiment, stand up to the evi-
dence? (I was starting to accept Hot-
chner’s testimony.) Is there a peculiar
spiritual disease American writers share,
vide Ambrose Bierce, Jack London,
Dreiser, Fitz Gerald, O’Neill, Ezra
Pound, and the rest? And, then, Hem-
ingway as a tentative Catholic, and the
episode of his impotence with Hadley,
cured after praying in a small chapel
in the faubourgs.
My last impressions are the ones I
am sticking to. This is not an unimpor-
tant book. Hotchner only seems to be
jumping on to the well-oiled band-
wagon, only appears to be taking his
place in the three-ring circus in which
Hemingway was the master of
ceremonies. The bullfighting legends,
the hospitality write-ups, 4 the business
about taming mountain lions: good
copy, but there is more than that. Hot-
chner knew something about Ernest
Hemingway that Leicester Hemingway
never knew, and his picture makes
better sense. The book’s first half can
be read as merely an introduction to
the second, in which the hero stands
forth as the victim, his own and others.
The friendship between biographer
and subject began in 1948, in Havana,
where Hotchner was sent by “Cosmo-
politan” to get an article out of the
most written-about writer of the cen-
tury. (A story he helped to commis-
sion later grew into “Across the River
and into the Trees.” How this novel
made their bond stronger is amusing:
Hemingway pretended that the last
chapters were unfinished, so that Hot-
chner would be sent to Europe with
him by a publisher who feared that,
without discreet supervision, the work
would never be completed. The pub-
lisher, of course, knew about Heming-
way’s heavy drinking.) In the years
that followed they beca,me confidantes.
IT is obvious that Hemingway’s whole
active life was a kind of pleasurable
self-destruction. He was writing himself
like a book whose hectic middle pas-
sage could lead only to one climax.
But why did he do it? Why could he
not cut himself free from the savage
pressures of publicity and the role-
playing he had assigned to himself?
Who did he have to impersonate? This
record does not tell us any more than
previous ones, but it documents the
terrible denouement as none has done
before. Hemingway, I believe, had to
face a crisis which he managed to post-
pone for too long, and which he
refused to face intelligently even, near
the end, with the consequence that he
was given the wrong treatment. In a
sense, if this account can be trusted, he
was murdered. He had tried to kill him-
self four times in the final months, but
the psychiatrists at Rochester released
him nevertheless, after an incomplete
series of ECTs.
So, we can only trace the descending
curve. The air crashes in Uganda dam-
Ernest Hemingway
aged his beautiful physique, but also
offered him a respite, which he did not
use as he might have, for taking stock,
for breaking out of the trap. Then
came the Nobel Prize, with all its
brouhaha, to confirm his doubts that he
had become a model in a fixed mould.
Several returns to Spain did not help
much, because the bullring was not a
solution to his problem but part of it:
this avenue led nowhere, save to a
deepening sense of guilt.
Incidentally, there is still a mystery
about what Hemingway rfeally did in the
Spanish War what fighting, for in-
stance? To what extent was he
genuinely a man of the Left? He con-
sidered himself so much an American
patriot that the Cuba events marked
a decisive downward turn qn his road.
He lost his much-loved house on the
island, the place where he felt rela-
tively safe. After this his confidence
went to the devil; he began to imagine
that he was going blind; he was losing
his creative grip. It makes moving and
awesome reading, especially the inter-
lude of the slaying of his dog in a
Castro razzia, which affected him
deeply. Sex, alcohol, and violent exer-
cise were forbidden him, but, worst of
all, he forbade himself the relief of
emotional rest. Perhaps he was vainly
and unskilfully groping for motive
springs buried under too much Hem-
ingway. He had missed his chance.
Depressive-persecutory mania. Fan-
tasies of being hunted by federal agents.
Grinding fear of those who love him,
including Miss Mary. “What do you
think happens to a man of sixty-two
when he realises he can never write the
books and stories he promised himself?”
Electric shocks shot into the faltering
brain, reporters rifling the hospital files
for titbits about the fallen lion; and so
to the gun rack and the last discharge.
Each man dies his own death, but
there is still the question about Jack
London, Fitz Gerald, O’Neill, and the
others. There may even be some link,
though not in time, between the killing
< of a man like John Kennedy and the
suicide of a man like Ernest Heming-
way. Death in the afternoon, or in the
morning.


Who is Hal Porter?
By LEONIE KRAMER
The Paper Chase. Hal Porter. Angus
and Robertson. $3.25.
SINCE I’ve no imagination,” writes
Hal Porter, “my vision of people
is limited by a belief in the value
of the qualities they openly tender, is
impaired by the clarity with which I
see the exact size of what they tender.
This is a great deal, as the widow’s mite
is a great deal.” This is not the first
time that Mr. Porter has declared him-
self lacking in imagination, and, since
he does not use words lightly, his state-
ment compels attention.
At this point in “The Paper Chase,”
the sequel to his earlier autobiography,
“The Watcher on the Cast Iron Bal-
cony,” he is looking back at the years
from 1929 to 1938, as the train carries
him away from Melbourne to Traral-
gon, where he has taken a job as a
schoolteacher. He has been fortunate in
the people he has met up till this time,
fortunate in “the refreshment offered
and accepted gratefully from the
chipped cups of their hearts.” Yet, lack-
ing imagination, he cannot put himself
“anywhere near reproducing their by-
gone feelings.” Fie judges them by
what they “openly tender,” not by what
they might hoard or conceal in areas
of their lives outside his experience. To
do so is consistent with his faith in
intuition and first impressions, in the
ability of one human being to sense the
qualities of another without necessarily
subjecting him to rational examination.
He is still the watcher, venturing no
further than his own direct observa-
tions will take him, and referring his
observations to his own scale of values.
If this is what Hal Porter means by
having no imagination, one must agree
with his view of himself. He is not
given to speculation about character or
to the fanciful reconstruction of feelings
and motives. One is impressed first of
all by the directness of his approach to
the past; people step out of time and
memory sharp and clear, unclouded by
interpretative adjustments from the
present.
Imagination cannot, however, so easily
be dismissed. If we are to concede that
Hal Porter’s “vision of people” is
limited in the way he suggests, we must
still want to know how it is that his
vision of people and things is so force-
fully communicated. Can a writer lack-
ing in imagination carry us back with
a flourish of the pen to a world that
we had forgotten, and make us recall
Its exact shape, color, and flavor?
Surely it is imagination which dic-
tates his selection of memories, deter-
mines his choice of detail, and shapes
his language into so precise an instru-
ment?
One’s first reaction to Hal Porter’s
descriptions of places and objects is to
praise them for their accuracy, to ad-
mire the memory which has preserved
the past so faithfully. Yet this is only
part of his achievement. His scenes
from the past live, not because they are
accurate but because they speak to
one’s recognition of what is true in ex-
perience.
One illustration of this struck me
with particular force. It is a descrip-
tion of the waterfront at Williams-
town, as I and thousands of others
have seen it’ (or any other waterfront,
for that matter). Hal Porter writes of
the “piers with their barnacle-and-
mussel-stockinged legs, and their rows
of bollards wearing iron bands tight
around their foreheads . . . Seagulls
sail and skim between the red funnels
and black masts, now and then utter-
ing cries of a disinterested defiance. All
else is drugged by the smell of oil,
wheat, blistered tar, and the sea deep-
breathing sensually under the wharf—
rich, black-green water in which white-
bait flicker like particles of thought.
Farther out, rarely and slowly, a wave-
top flashes its jewellery, flutters a vague
and farewell hand . . .” This is bril-
liant observation, which leads us to a
pushing aside of the solitude which
has made it possible.
Hal Porter
Yet what one admires here is not so
much the accuracy of the detail as the
sense it makes in terms of a shared
mood and experience. Meaning and
beauty spring from the commonplace.
It is true, of course, that some of the
interest in “The Paper Chase” comes
from recognition of the known and
familiar. Hal Porter’s love of the Gipps-
land countryside infects his descrip-
tions; his delight in people and places,
in the smaller, quieter Melbourne of
the ’thirties, where the countryside had
not retreated so far from the city, has
a strong nostalgic attraction. His pride
in Australians will probably shock the
gloomy purveyors of pessimistic news
about Australian inferiority. All these
and many more details of the past are
controlled by his view of his own de-
velopment. From Williamstown to Mel-
bourne to T'raralgon to Adelaide to
Tasmania and to Japan we are partici-
pants in the paper chase which is the
writer’s Jife.
The local details are never merely
decorative; they plot the growth of
the writer’s experience, and reflect his
changing attitudes. In the quality of
his memories and in his use of the facts
of history he fully justifies his descrip-
tion of himself as “one who is con-
cerned with the truth rather than the
facts.” One sentence summarises and
explains one of the central facts of “The
Paper Chase” “The quality of one’s
connection with people through their
relation with things, tunes, scents,
sounds, and so on is a subject of great
allure, its existence a great blessing.”
This conviction is vividly present to
the reader on almost every page of the'
book.
Strangely enough, though, Hal Porter
himself proves to be a something of a
will-o’-the-wisp. Not that one can
doubt his existence —he talks, thinks,
walks, wears certain kinds of clothes,
dances, sings, has friends, marries,
travels, works, writes, eats, and drinks.
He has views, attitudes, and opinions.
Yet I had the curious feeling that I was
watching a reflection in a mirror. This
is no doubt partly the effect of time
and distance. The present Hal Porter is
writing about his past selves, and he
presents himself, as he does others, with
warmth but detachment. Much is told;
more, perhaps, is left unsaid. That one
learns so much about him and yet
finds him so elusive is not, I think,
merely an illustration of the common-
place that human beings resist defini-
tion. It has to do with his view of
identity. “Because a person is largely
a series of mental happenings, however
minute, connected to a shape of bones
and flesh, I am cqmposed of what
hangs on the millions of hooks—Aud-
rey’s wink, Esther’s black dress, Stella’s
forgiveness . . .” And, “Experiences
and convictions are, like God, portable.
They travel with me, whatever I am.”
“The Paper Chase” is full of portable
effects, the luggage of life. But who
is the person carrying them about Aus-
tralia and Japan? Every now and then
he allows us a glimpse of himself (who-
ever he is), but not often and not for
long. “One wants to be alone, funda-
mentally,” he writes, “not to escape
others but to escape oneself, the vers-
ions of self compelled into existence by
others. It is safer for me to be mere
wood than to be wood painted to look
like wood.” This is one of the many
revealing comments scattered through-
out this self-disclosing, self-disguising
autobiography. They lead him
to a conclusion that could be
arrived at only by a writer determined
not to “dehydrate the truth of appear-
ances into the lie of fact.” It is that
“Here, having seen more than I have
ever seen, I know that I know less
than I have ever known.”


On the Rocks
By NANCY KEESING
The Rocks, Sydney. Drawings by Unk
White, text by Olaf Ruhen. Rigby.
$1.95.
I THINK it was Sacheverell Sitwell
who said somewhere that the great
talent of the Italian people lay in
their refusing to allow their cities to
become museums. Ancient buildings are
kept in continuous use. They had de-
molished much that an antiquarian
would regret, but other beautiful build-
ings occupy old sites. For all I know of
Italy this assessment is disputable, but
I try to gain hope from it when I con-
sider the inevitable fate of “The Rocks,”
that early-built and little-altered area
to the west of Circular Quay which,
to any true Sydneysider, is endlessly
fascinating.
It must and will be altered soon,
although a few historically worthy
buildings will be retained and we are
assured the sort of civic vandalism
which allowed, for instance, the demo-
lition of Burdekin House will not be
repeated. But to its lovers every little
house, every tortuous lane seems prec-
ious, though most of us admit a pref-
erence for more spacious living with
less of damp and dry rot, elsewhere.
If the actuality of the old Rocks has
to vanish it is good that devoted mem-
orials remain. Years ago Lionel Lind-
say drew a splendid series of views of
the area, many of which commemorate
landmarks which have long made way
for the Harbor Bridge approaches. No
subsequent artist seemed likely to ap-
proach Lindsay. Merle and Ronald
Peters’ recent “Sketchbook of The
Rocks” was charming, but did not en-
tirely fill the need.
Now Unk White with his drawings
and Olaf Ruhen with his text have, in
“The Rocks, Sydney,” produced a small
book which is exactly what one wished.
It even, in its modest compass, finds
room for Ruhen’s interesting assertion
that from the moment Governor Phillip
chose his site for a settlement the Aus-
tralian proletariat was destined to be
moulded by the peculiar nature of The
Rocks area that the Australian’s
image of himself as a careless, raffish
scrounger, resistant to authority and in-
dependent as a native porcupine, is
much more typical of The Rocks than
of “The Bush.”
The text is also generous with his-
tory and anecdote and the drawings are
superb. People who remember Unk
White as a too-prolific, too-slick pro-
ducer of joke blocks and illustrations
are due for an artistic surprise. The
careful craftsmanship, the eye for im-
portant detail, the flair for selectivity
and composition which earned him an
early reputation have not been des-
troyed by the necessities of hack work.
My only regret that White was
not nearby one recent evening when,
passing the venerable “Hero of Water-
loo” hotel at dusk, I paused to listen to
a grizzled man in sailor’s striped jacket
who stood in the open doorway and
beat time with a genuine anachronistic
peg-leg as he entertained his fellow
drinkers with old tunes from an ancient
concertina. It could only happen in
“The Rocks.”
Of human
bondage
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
Octopussy and the Living Daylights.
lan Fleming. Cape. $1.35.
WHAT happens when a deadly
scorpion fish is fed to an octo-
pus? Does the octopus reject it,
is it poisoned by the fish, or does it
have an inbuilt immunity to poison?
This interesting problem is not
answered, because the octopus finds
Major Dexter Smythe of much more
interest than the scorpion fish that the
Major is offering Octopussy for supper.
If one had two bars of Nazi gold,
At the Waxworks Museum
Here, says the guide: a flight of dusty steps
Furred with mauve grime, barred with white iron
cages.
It is their home, the murderers, whose rages
Stifled by wax leapt outward through glass eyes.
Pain pressed in borrowed coats. A thin voice raps
Its firm instruction: show no pained surprise.
For these they are, the stilted simulations
You all could be, given some lethal dawn
When she has taken one more hope in pawn.
You could be him with eyes like burned-out bulbs,
Playing the organ with a nightmare patience
While in his bathtub drown her many selves.
Or him with knife and bucket on the prowl,
In a policeman’s cloak his hell disguised.
Or that thin clerk who in his anguish prised
Off her cold mask and saw the steel within.
Their waxen mouths set in a spurious howl,
Each eye fixed like a thing beneath a pin.
They lent their clothes before they made the last
Sad, seasick walk to ladder, hood, and drop.
Each day their guardians brush them, comb a crop
Of prison hair, and wax a thin moustache.
Observe how glass eyes still preserve a cast,
Legs still are bowed, the beardless skin still harsh.
And see yourself up there, if you let go;
Crippen, they say, did out the house in pink
A week before he fixed that shocking drink.
And you could, too, with paint and ladder rung.
Pulsing with hatred for pink hours or so
It would be like living inside a lung.
Heath dapper with his straps and bed, Landru
With topiary beard, and Liz with axe;
More doomed and fragile what is not wax:
Children with cool balloons, eyes of blue glass.
The murderous figures smile when we go through,
Seeing the things they are demurely pass.
For bind a thin clerk’s loins in tight with khaki,
Give matrons knives for beach-heads, hand boys
guns,
And you will shoot the first who turns and runs.
Look at your own hand, itching for the haft.
The difference is, you dare not call it larky.
Theirs was the art. Yours is the tradesman’s craft.
CHARLES HIGHAM


a great moment
for all
whisky
drinkers
Connoisseurs are aware of the vital part grain plays in pro-
ducing a fine, smooth whisky. Australian barley, grown
under ideal climatic conditions, has reached such high
quality that it is now recognised internationally for its
superb whisky-producing qualities. This is important for
Australia; it is important for the entire Australian Whisky
industry. For the first time our modern distilleries, with
their highly skilled blenders and strict quality controls, are
now able to create smooth, matured whiskies of truly
unique character.
This is the era when Australian Whisky has achieved full
international recognition—so much so that it is being
sought in increasing quantities by overseas countries.
Connoisseurs are already celebrating this new era. Why
not join in and enjoy a nip or two tonight? You'll be

how would one dispose of them? Did
you know that gold minted by the
Nazis contained ten percent of lead?
At one level Fleming functions as a
Ripley’s “Believe It Or Not,” who in-
structs while entertaining us with titil-
lation of blonde Russian spies in white
silk slacks. The surface is as glossy
as Estapolled pinewood. Fleming writes
clean-smelling prose which is deodorant-
fresh, but this is deodorant with a kick.
“Octopussy” is the first of these short
stories and the. more impressive of the
two. It is a mood piece about a decay-
ing English Major in Jamaica who
swims around his reef, tending, his
fish-friends and supplying them with
titbits of algae. The Major has an
impressive and immaculate front, but
inside he is disintegrating with emo-
tional dry-rot, aimlessness, too much
alcohol, and a very nasty secret which
he has been sitting on since the end of
World War 11. He murdered a man
to get hold of some bars of German
gold, and the corpse is lying inside a
glacier until the moment when it will
come out of the bottom with the cer-
tainty of a slow-motion time-bomb.
ir P'HE story does not rely on tension
as much as the usual Fleming mix-
ture, but manages to be quite gripping.
Bond makes only a guest appearance as
the Secret Service agent investigating
Major Dexter Smythe’s case. He
watches dispassionately through the
glass as the Major writhes in his gold-
fish bowl of anguish. The end of the
story is very nasty and savage.
“The Living Daylights” is a tension
piece which has a massive and exciting
build-up. Bond sweats, lusts, and drinks
his way through this story as the main
character. His assignment is to shoot
a Communist sniper who is to shoot a
British agent escaping into West Ber-
lin.
At the denouement Bond suddenly
realises his antagonist in the distant
darkened window is a beautiful girl
whom he has been hungering for. He
djeflects his aim so that he does not hit
her, but puts her weapon out of action.
It is a gesture of defiant humanity in
a world of red-tape, planned assassina-
tions, distrust, and meaningless violence.
Inevitably the gesture is only temporary
and ineffectual, because the weary
struggle between the great ideologies
goes on. Bond stays in the fight more
because of his hatred of the dirtiness
of the other side than because he is
enamored of liberal democracy.
Weltschmerz is one of the clues of
Fleming’s success. Beneath the smooth,
finely textured surface a grotesque octo-
pus is waving its tentacles slowly. The
octopus is despair.
The face of lan Fleming that stares
out of the back cover above the im-
maculate polka-dot bow tie is hand-
some, like well-seasoned timber. The
line of the cheek is stoic. The eyes are
cold jade, staring defiantly at a mean-
ingless world.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Real Problems
IN all the fuss over whether the Government knows what
it is doing with the economy, some of the most important
factors likely to affect Australia’s economic prospects are
in danger of being overlooked. Three major international
trade situations that have to be resolved—the Kennedy
Round of tariff negotiations, the renewed British attempt to
enter the EEC, and the problem of over-capacity in the
world steel industry—may prove far more important to our
future than whether local house building increases or motor
registrations rise. And these three do not include the biggest
unresolved problem of all—what is going to happen to
improve the world liquidity shortage that is now having such
a recessive impact on world trade?
The strong improvement in the position of the Republican
Party in last week’s U.S. elections could well reduce the
prospects of Congress giving the sort of support to the
Kennedy Round that the Johnson Administration will need
if world agreement is not reached by next June. The legis-
lation under which the U.S. Government can come to agree-
ment under the Kennedy Round (the Trade Expansion Act)
expires in June, 1967, and may be very difficult to extend.
So the four-year-old negotiations are now about to enter a
crisis stage, with mid-February having been set as the dead-
line for the final negotiating offers.
Participants in the Kennedy Round have been asked to
submit their detailed preliminary offers of concessions the
GATT by the end of this month. The key things about
these offers will be not only the provisos for carrying them
out but also the threats of what will happen if other
negotiators do not agree. The Kennedy Round, which
originally aimed at cutting tariffs by 50 percent, now has
much more modest targets. The “Economist” says that on
the industrial side tariffs could be reduced by an average
of from 20 to 30 percent. But sights are set much lower in
agriculture and that is where the principal crisis will occur,
particularly as far as Australia is concerned.
To the world as a whole, the EEC is offering tariff con-
cessions of less than 10 percent on about one-sixth of the
farm products it imports, as the EEC aims at becoming
90 percent self-sufficient in grains by use of variable levies
whose uncertain heights would play havoc with exporting
countries.
Unless world agreement can be reached at the continuing
series of Geneva meetings on freer cereals trade at predict-
able prices, Australia’s Trade Minister, Mr. McEwen, sees
little chance of progress in the whole Kennedy Round and
has warned that unless some success is achieved in the next
three months, the whole series of negotiations would fail.
The “Economist” says, however, that none of the par-
ticipating countries seriously believes (as some critics have
complained) that the Kennedy Round died some time ago
as far as any hope of avoiding fragmentation of world trade
is concerned. “The prevailing feeling in the GATT secre-
tariat and among most European Governments is that a
whole range of tariffs are going to be reduced to a point
where they will be of marginal significance.” But if a lot
of tariffs come down by 50 percent a lot will stay where
they are. The coming months of negotiations will be most
important for Australia.
Australia’s second international trade problem is Britain
and the EEC. The implications of possible British entry
into the Common Market have been well canvassed in the
past, and while the' diversification of Australia’s trading
pattern in the last four years has lessened the sort of impact
MEN AND MATTERS
EVER since Conzinc Riotinto of
Australia was born out of the
merger between Consolidated
Zinc and Rio Tin to Australia in 1962,
the former chairman of the local Rio
Tinto company, Mr. Blake Pelly, has
taken a back seat in the new organisa-
tion, behind Consolidated Zinc’s ener-
getic Sir Maurice Mawby.
The Rio Tinto activities that Mr.
Pelly brought to CRA (uranium, coal,
quarrying, and brickmaking) have not
been nearly as impressive as those of
the Consolidated Zinc partner with its
aluminium, lead, zinc, sulphuric acid,
and fertilisers.
But at last Mr. Pelly’s putsch can
claim a victory. The Hamersley iron
ore developments, officially opened last
week, emerged out of a Rio Tinto
exploration that began before the mer-
ger and which led to the discovery of
Mt. Tom Price in the Pilbaras.
Blake Pelly, now vice-chairman of
CRA (and a member of several other
public company boards), is a Cambridge
engineering graduate (Emmanuel) who
came to Australia in 1937 to be personal
ADC to the Governor, Lord Wakehurst,
as a member of the RAAF. He became
a farmer as well before going off to the
war, ending up as a Group-Captain and
getting out in 1946. From 1950 until
his sudden resignation in 1957, he was
a Liberal member
of the N.S.W. Legis-
lative Assembly (he
now draws a $2O a
week parliamentary
pension) and is a
committee member
of the AJC.
CRA’s chairman,
Sir Maurice
Mawby, has a very
different back-
ground indeed.
Born in Broken
Hill, he joined the Zinc Corporation
in 1928 as a metallurgist, and his work
in the development of the all-flotation
treatment process brought him inter-
national recognition. He has been
wholly and solely a company man all
his working life, although he does hold
other directorships—but all of them are
associated some way with CRA.
SPECIALIST engineering surveyors
are going to be in great demand
in Australia in the coming period
of more intensive minerals develop-
ment. Recently arrived to set up head-
quarters in Melbourne to exploit the
possibilities is 41-year-old London
engineer Mr. T. J. C. Crocker, chairman
of Engineering Surveys (Aust.) Ltd.,
Sir M. Mawby
Blake Pelly
T. J. C. Crocker
whose associate company, Engineering
Surveys Ltd., is one of the biggest land
and hydrographic survey groups in
Britain, with contracts scattered over
the globe.
After his degree in engineering at
London University, Crocker served his-
articles with the big U.K. firm Costain.
Then he became senior civil engineer
on a $23 million iron ore development
scheme in Sierra Leone.
In true pioneering fashion, Crocker
has lately been criss-crossing the coun-
try contacting likely clients, including
governments, semi-government authori-
ties, and companies. Apparently he can
tackle anything in the survey line and
will specialise in natural gas pipelines,
the siting of oil and gas wells, and
general operations.


that would have followed Britain’s unsuccessful 1961-62
negotiations, the fact remains that Australia still stands to
suffer serious damage, not only from the end of special
trading relations with Britain, but also from the erection
of tariff barriers against us.
Steel is the third problem. The forecast by the BHP of
a world steel surplus into the 19705, the increasing competi-
tion being met by John Lysaght in local steel sales because
of imports of cheap Japanese steel made from Australian
iron ore, and the crisis of over-capacity in the European
steel industry all combine to put a small dampener on the
high hopes held for Australian iron ore exports in coming
years. In Europe, steel sales have been falling and surplus
capacity is now about 20 percent, its highest level since
the war, bringing with it cut-throat competition and prices
which are far below those of Britain or the U.S. Australia
now looks to the Japanese steel industry as a big supplier
of foreign exchange, and has hopes of following up its
iron ore sales to Wales with some to the Continent. The
world steel problem could end up Australia’s problem, too.
Humbug and Quotas
IT will be a great day when these wretched quotas on
margarine are finally gone. With them will go the
humbug with which the dairyfarmerr extraordinary
privileges are rationalised, and also the stupid waste of mas-
sive public relations and counter-advertising campaigns.
The N.S.W. Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Chaffey, said
some very silly things last week, in the exasperation of the
Parliamentary debate on the Marrickville case. It was quite
ludicrous for him to claim that the company would have
had to put off men had it saved itself money by not
canvassing its case in the Mrs. Jones’ series of advertisements.
Like any business concern it only employs the number of
people needed to produce what it can sell. And in this
case it cannot continue selling at its previous level because
of the enforcement of the quotas. There may, of course,
be a propaganda element in the dismissal of the whole 300
men, but that is another matter.
Mr. Chaffey has also been far too slow in making public
details of the conditions on which he renewed Marrickville’s
licence. It is still not at all clear how the quota will be
applied whether the production already recorded this
year will be included or excluded from the quotas figure,
whether the inspection and enforcement procedures will be
effective, and if so, whether they will be unduly bureaucratic.
The other difficulty is that the N.S.W. Government offers
no hint of a way out of the problem. It cannot persist for
long keeping margarine production down at the ridiculously
restricted level which the present law sets. It' must allow
consumer demands to be met. This is not to say that they
must go all the way and immediately abandon all controls.
But there must be an indication of a preparedness to seek
a way out of the present untenable situation.
Pricing Natural Gas
UNDERSTANDABLY, the Victorian Premier, Sir Henry
Bolte, was anxious to squeeze the best deal he could
for the State from the negotiations on the price of
natural gas he’s been having with Esso-BHP. Critics of
the protracted delay in reaching a settlement had imagined
that Sir Henry was sticking out for as low a price as pos-
sible, while Esso-BHP were insisting on their pound of
flesh. As it happened, the play was not so much on Sir
Henry angling for a low price as on what he could persuade
Esso-BHP to do in the way of adding to Victorian industry,
say by building a fertiliser plant as a quid pro quo for a
big price for the gas.
It turns out that the price is much higher than N.S.W.,
for instance, prefers to pay for it when it can get refinery
gas even cheaper. So for the moment there is no prospect
of it being piped to Sydney. As for Victorian consumers,
they find no real joy in virtually subsidising a fertiliser
plant.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
FOr the economy: Analysing a great range of
seasonally adjusted statistics, Dr. A. R. Hall, of the
Australian National University, draws a conclusion that
“the slack in the economy as a whole is negligible” and
that no additional action by the Federal Government
is called for.
Sales at Sydney, Geelong, and Portland saw average
wool prices fall back, to reach a level about five per-
cent lower than a year ago . . . The London sugar
price struck a postwar low of £stgl3f a ton . . . “Sub-
stantial procurement of uranium from Australia will
be made in due course,” said Rio Tinto Zinc Corpora-
tion’s chairman, Mr. Val Duncan, when charged with
at present favoring the group’s Canadian mines.
Sir Henry Bolte reveals that Esso believes reserves
of some 500 million barrels of oil are under the Bass
Strait field . . . Esso-BHP and the Victorian Gas and
Fuel Corporation have agreed on pricing arrangements
for natural gas from Bass Strait.
Shipping freight rates from Britain and the Conti-
nent go up four percent from March 1, 1967 . . . BHP
considers the current world steel surplus will endure
into the 19705, thus reducing export prices.
For the markets: Although down slightly on
the week, Australian share markets succeeded in looking
rather better on Friday after four days of retreat.
Volumes, however, remain unexciting; more uniformity
among leaders and good enquiry for base metals pro-
vided most of the closing stimulus.
A Thursday rally brought some hope to London, but
leaders slipped again on Friday to halt further general
advance. Retails, textiles, and tobaccos appeared reason-
ably firm . . . Wall Street has moved up mildly since
the election, steels and' amusement issues helping at
the end. Volumes are unremarkable.
For companies: Iron ore took the glitter (and
the gold?). At Dampier, W.A., CRA-Kaiser’s Hamersley
Iron Pty. declared its first stage open before a financially
glamorous international gathering, raising hopes of a
Second pelletising plant which may be sited in Japan.
Closer to the Australian earth, a public issue with local
participation was announced for “as early as possible
next year” . . . Tasmania’s Savage River project gives
Australia a 12-|- percent equity interest, taken up through
a 25 percent holding in the half-owner, North-west Iron
Co. Ltd. Five life institutions, Kathleen Investments and
Ampol Petroleum are to provide the $4 million needed
for this share.
Other miners did not lag behind, either . . . Mount
Morgan forecast a “significantly higher” 1966-67 profit
than the latest $1,470,255, no water shortages, full ore
treatment and similar grades; the company’s own iron
ore effort, Mount Bundey (N.T.), begins production
early in 1968 . . . Less effusive than its first announce-
ment, Broken Hill South gave news of a second phos-
phate rock deposit in Queensland . . . Despite some
interrupted operation, Ravenshoe Tin Dredging sent
earnings up by $117,550 to $377,508; the one-for-one
bonus proposal goes before December 7’s annual meeting
. . . Gold producer North Kalgurlie did not allow a
small profit decline, from £5tg.84,261 to £5tg.77,049, to
hinder a dividend lift from 3d to 6d a share.
Oil’s fillip came from AOG, whose first dividend,
and the first from any domestic oil producer, will be
known on December 9.
Pioneer Concrete lays claim to a more than 50 percent
acceptance of its bid to F. W. Williams’ shareholders;
some of the undertakings are “verbal” . . . Hothlyn
Securities of U.K. will go direct to the shareholders of
Reinvestment (Aust.), whose directors rejected their
offer, and have a “further approach.”
Shareholders, note holders and debenture holders of

Company Meeting:
COMENG HOLDINGS LIMITED
Copy of speech delivered by the Chairman, Mr. F. P. Donohoe, at the Annual General Meeting
of Stockholders of Comeng Holdings Limited held in Sydney on Bth November, 1966, is set out
hereunder for the information of stockholders who were unable to attend the meeting.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
It is with pleasure that I welcome you to
this Twentieth Annual General Meeting of
the Stockholders of Comeng Holdings
Limited.
I believe that you will have been well
pleased by the results conveyed to you in
your Company’s Annual Report presented
for your consideration at today’s meeting.
The Balance Sheet at 30th June, 1966, and
the Profit and Loss Account for the year
ended on that date together with reports
thereon from your Directors and the Com-
pany’s Auditors were forwarded to you to-
gether with the Notice convening this meet-
ing. May I therefore presume that I have
your approval to take them as read?
You will no doubt have noted that con-
solidated profit for the year available to
Comeng Holdings Limited (after providing
for the interests of outside shareholders in
the Company’s partly owned subsidiaries)
has risen by 34% from $788,964 to $1,057,348
and the ratio of these earnings to the issued
capital of the Company at 30th June has
increased from 23.3% to 27.15% despite the
increase of $514,375 in issued capital which
took place as a consequence of the conver-
sion of convertible notes for the same
amount on Ist July, 1965.
These results are arrived at after deduct-
ing capital losses of $15,508 resulting from
disposal or revaluation of fixed assets and
after transferring $170,000 to a provision
for Contract Contingencies and Research. A
further $B,OOO was transferred to a similar
provision in the accounts of a newly acquired
subsidiary. The profits of such subsidiary
will not be aggregated with the profits of
other Companies in the Group until the
1966/67 year.
The long term contracting field in which
most companies in the Comeng Group oper-
ate calls for a critical approach to account-
ing techniques in order that profit assess-
ments for the relatively short period of each
twelve months may be as accurate as pos-
sible and also to ensure that adequate pro-
vision is made for certain types of expendi-
ture which may be substantial over the life
of a long term contract even though the
incidence of same may be only slight in a
given twelve monthly period.
It is typical of this industry, for example,
that substantial research expenditure and
special contract charges occur from time to
time but at irregular intervals. The provision
made under this heading during the period
under review has been made with the aim
of equalising the effect of such expenditure,
and of thus avoiding an undue charge in
any one year.
In drawing attention to a second aspect
of the accounts before you. I would again
remind stockholders of certain of my re-
marks addressed to you at our Meeting a
year ago wherein I emphasised that in
accordance with normal practice the Parent
Company’s Balance Sheet traditionally lists
shares in subsidiary companies at cost.
During the year under review we have writ-
ten a small amount off this asset to reflect
the revaluation of the investment in a sub-
sidiary which had accumulated trading
losses. However, no attempt has been made
to reflect the substantially enhanced value
of the South African investment over its
original cost except to the extent to which
this factor is reflected in the consolidated
earning rate.
Traditional accounting practices, as they
relate to Consolidated Accounts, have been
adopted in the preparation of the accounts
but I believe that stockholders should again
be reminded that if the appreciation in the
established market value of the South
African investment were to be added to the
net Australasian tangible assets at audited
book value then the resulting tangible asset
backing of the shares of Comeng Holdings
Limited would be substantially higher than
the figure indicated by the Consolidated
Accounts.
I now propose to briefly review our opera-
tions in Australasia and South Africa:—
AUSTRALASIA:
The group again performed or commenced
a variety of major contracts during the
period under review and I will detail some
of the more significant amongst them so that
you may be aware, Ladies and Gentlemen,
of the scope of your Company’s operations.
We have supplied, or are supplying—
Modern stainless steel coaches for Com-
monwealth Railways.
Rolling stock for the transport of motor
cars.
109 Brake Vans for the New South Wales
Railways.
Power car shells for the Victorian Rail-
ways.
Louvred Vans for the transport of general
merchandise.
Liauid petroleum gas cars and other in-
dustrial rolling stock for the Oil and
Steel Industries.
Hot Metal cars for the Steel Industry.
Mine Cars and mining and canefield loco-
motives.
Assembly of Clyde-G.M. Diesel Electric
Mainline Locomotives for use on the
Queensland Government railway system.
Fabrication work on patrol vessels for the
Australian Navy.
The demand for railway rolling stock was
slightly less in the past twelve months than
in the previous year and competition from
Australian and Overseas suppliers continues
to be keen.
Operations in the general engineering field
were successful during the year, thus pro-
viding a continued extension of our opera-
tions outside our traditional field of railway
rolling stock. To further its capabilities in
the wider field your Company has acquired
a 56.9% interest in Mining & General
Engineering Limited of Viilawood. In fulfil-
ment of a condition of that acquisition we
are currently offering to acquire the remain-
ing shares in Mining & General Engineering
Limited at the same price as that which
applied to the original acquisition.
It is my view and that of your Board that
the locations of our subsidiary company
plants (spread as they are over a very wide
area), increase the Company’s potential and
at the same time provide a desirable spread
of investment.
Plant additions at Granville, Rocklea, Dan-
denong and Bassendean have been deliber-
ately planned so as to ensure that we are
able to adopt the latest developments in the
general engineering field.
Mining & General Engineering Limited is
a very successful Company both financially
and in its field of engineering. Its Managing
Director, Mr. A. Burt, is one of the original
founders of the Company and has managed
its affairs -for many years. He will continue
in his position with the Company which
should provide a very welcome addition to
the Comeng Group.
The Group’s subsidiaries in Australia have
maintained their rate of activity during the
year by comparison with the 1964/65 year
and they finished the latest year with a
satisfactory carry forward of work for future
execution.
SOUTH AFRICA:
The company’s South African subsidiary.
Union Carriage & Wagon Co. (Pty.) Limited
again completed and delivered during the
period substantial quantities of railway roll-
ing stock orde'red by the South African Rail-
ways as well as a number of locomotives for
local industrial concerns. Deliveries to the
South African Railways comprised:—
94 2500 h.p. Mainline Electric Locomotives.
234 Passenger and Officials Coaches.
156 Parcel and Baggage Vans.
Late in 1965 Union Carriage & Wagon Co.
(Pty.) Limited won an order for 225 electric
locomotives with a contract value of approxi-
mately $A.38.2 million. Success with this
tender reflects, I believe, the competitive
prices and good workmanship being offered
by “Union.” Whilst our subsidiary enjoys
the position of being the sole manufacturer
of locomotives and passenger rolling stock
within South Africa, very keen competition
is constantly provided by overseas manufac-
turers. These latter are, at times, prepared
to tender at sub-economic prices in order to
secure a share of the market. Union Car-
riage secures and maintains its success only
by means of keen prices and efficient execu-
tion of its contracts.
Union’s output increased over the previous
year and profits again showed a substantial
improvement.
Our association with the two resident pub-
lic companies who are co-shareholders and
with the other shareholders of- Union has
been most cordial. The forward order posi-
tion of our subsidiary is most satisfactory
with some production lines loaded two years
or more ahead. Nevertheless, the rate of
increase in activity in South Africa, which
has been quite remarkable during recent
years, can now be expected to steady as
demand levels out.
During the year the Nigel Plant was
visited on more than one occasion, by our
Managing Director, Mr. Trimble, and I also
visited this subsidiary, accompanied by the
Secretary of Comeng Holdings Limited. In
the light of the information, and impres-
sions gained, during these visits, I am
pleased to convey to you the Board’s satis-
faction with our South African investment.
GENERAL:
I believe that the results of your Company
for the year and its financial position at
balance date give just cause for some pride
in the strength and in the accomplishments
of this Company. Your Board is very con-
scious that our present position will be
maintained and improved only by a sustained
and determined effort, both to consolidate
and expand. Particular attention is being
devoted to the continuous and further
development of the Group’s traditional skills.
At the same time it is our policy to seek
opportunities to broaden the base of your
Companies’ activities with a view to employ-
ing to the full the resources of money and
credit plant and skills increasingly
developed by the Comeng Group.
I will refrain from using the word diversi-
fication, rather I will explain that the policy
of your Board is that the Company shall
take advantage of any available opportunity
which can with a proper degree of commer-
cial caution be embraced by the Group to
consolidate and improve the position of the
Company and its subsidiaries and the con-
tinuity and amount of the profits available
for distribution to shareholders.
As to dividends, yq,ur Directors believe that
in the light of its dividend history since
incorporation and its present position,
Comeng Holdings Limited may fairly be
regarded as an investment which will yield
at least 10% return on the par value of
its shares despite the fact that it operates
in a field characterised by fluctuating
demand. The results of some years have
been and will tfe such as to warrant the
distribution of amounts in excess of 10%
and when this position arises, then if it is
advisable your Directors propose to continue
a policy of recommending bonus dividends.
In both the Report of the Directors and
the Company’s preliminary announcement of
profit for the year, the forecast was made
that the results for the 1966/67 year would
again warrant the Directors recommending
a bonus dividend in respect of that year.
I am happy to say that your Directors know
of no reason to modify that view at this
stage.
DIRECTORS AND STAFF:
I would like to record my warm apprecia-
tion of the co-operation extended to me by
my fellow Directors who have worked capably
and diligently in the performance of their
duties and I would also like to acknowledge
the loyalty and efficiency of the management
and staff throughout the year.
Finally, Ladies and Gentlemen, it affords
me pleasure to move that the Balance Sheet
of the Company as at 30th June, 1966, the
Profit and Loss Account for the year ended
on that date and the Reports of the Direc-
tors and Auditors thereon be received and
approved, and I invite some stockholder to
second the motion.
F. P. DONOHOE.
Chairman of Directors.


ECONOMIC POLICY
AND RESEARCH
The General Financial and Economic Policy Branch of the Commonwealth
Treasury has opportunities for graduates of superior academic attainment
to work in the fields of economic policy and research. The areas of work

PETER SAMUEL'S CANBERRA
The Cost of Labor Promises
A FORTNIGHT ago, when Arthur
Calwell issued a long screed in
which he said the ALP’s election
program was going to cost s3oom.
there was evidence in Hansard that
Mr. Whitlam and others had, over a
period of months, been extracting a lot
of cost information from Government
departments through detailed ques-
tions in the House. This gave rise to
hopes that there would be no repetition
of the old wrangles over where the
money to pay for election promises
would come from.
What actually happened seems clear.
Mr. Calwell did have a s3oom. pro-
gram, reasonably well worked out, and
defensible in its costing. But at the last
minute he simply threw it overboard
and decided with reckless abandon to
offer voters everything that came to his
mind. There was an eight-point pro-
gram concentrating on social services
and education which Mr. Calwell esti-
mates will cost s2Bsm. and this was
the original sum-total of the ALP offer.
Now Mr. Calwell has simply thrown
in another two dozen proposals, with-
out any hint at their cost or probably
any idea.
look like adding to about
ssoom. extra, making complete non-
sense of the original statement. On top
of this would come a huge collection
of new props and sops for farmers,
the cost of which is anyone’s guess.
All in all, the ALP proposes an
immediate expansion in Commonwealth
Government outlays of close to a bil-
lion dollars. This, it must be remem-
bered, would be imposed on top of the
usual annual increase of between
s3oom. and s4oom. due to promotions
and the inexorably growing task of
maintaining existing services for an
expanding population. Incredible as it
sounds, Labor’s proposals amount to
an immediate increase in Government
spending of between 25 and 30 per-
cent. There’s not very much that is
impossible to buy at a price. But what
a price it would be!
If there was not to be violent infla-
tion—to be given a kick off, anyway,
by price controls, cheap money and
automatic cost of living adjustments—
there would have to be increases in
taxation and charges of a severity quite
unprecedented in our history.
A prediction here a month back that
stage two of the Ord scheme would
proceed was horribly mistaken. At that
time Mr. McEwen had switched de-
cisively from being an Ord-antagonist
into being an Ord-advocate. His power-
ful advocacy, plus the need to assuage
the Western Australians, plus the cer-
tainty that the Labor Party would be
for it, combined to produce an atmos-
phere in Cabinet highly favorable to
the scheme. Mr. McEwen let it be
widely known that he was switching,
and Treasury officials and others, con-
cerned to limit the number of white
elephants to be fed by taxpayers, were
very despondent, conceding even that
the battle was all over. But to the
astonishment of everyone, when Cabinet
met it held firm.
It transpires that, in fact, Mr.
McEwen, far from supporting the Ord
scheme, launched a vigorous attack on
the proposal, illustrating his arguments
with vivid references to the difficulties
of soldier settlers ruined on uneconomic
projects after the war. The suggestion
that Mr. McEwen fought for the Ord
and was over-ruled by his Liberal Party
colleagues is ridiculous, though, of
course, it is a very convenient line to
encourage. Mr. McEwen, always a
realist, well appreciates that the Coun-
try Party needs votes wherever it can
get them, and the generous collection
of new aids to the rural community
generally are a better proposition. And
he is very rarely over-ruled when he
sets his mind on something.

Holt's Edge on Holyoake
By CROESUS
IN his policy speech last week Mr.
Holt apparently didn’t feel an im-
pelling need to offer any new econ-
omic carrots, only social welfare ones
and more featherbeds for farmers
(what a boon the Liberal-CP coalition
has been for them over the years!). Nor
-were there any promises to give the
economy the lift it now needs. The
unspoken neglect of intention to stir
the economic pot could come from hav-
ing been in office too long. Seventeen
years is a long time; in the one groove
one inclines to become blase. At any
rate, it seemed to leave the door of
opportunity wide open to any opposi-
tion party with fresh economic ideas
(I don’t know of one).
However, not everybody is satisfied
with the present lulled state of the
economy, despite Mr. Bury’s explana-
tions. One can imagine, say, what Mr.
Holyoake in New Zealand would give
for the opportunity passed up by Holt.
He also has to face the electoral music
on November 26. According to knowl-
edgeable New Zealanders, Holyoake is
simply postponing the evil day of re-
trenchment until he has the necessary
numbers on the board.
Ever since the further restrictions on
overseas exchange transactions in his
June Budget, the N.Z. Finance Minister,
Mr. Luke, has been arduously buying
time, notably by making some very ex-
pensive overseas loans, to shore up a
fairly precarious balance of payments
so as to avert a pre-election cutback
in domestic economic activity. Mr.
McMahon has been doing just the
opposite since his August Budget. He
has been comfortably repatriating part
of Australia’s overseas debt and allow-
ing local activity to coast along at
something below full pace. In present
circumstances Luke has little chance,
it would seem, of imparting new vigor
to the N.Z. economy until the N.Z.
balance of payments is out of the wood,
which shouldn’t be for some time. Here
the coast looks clear for McMahon (or
his successor) to make an early injec-
tion to liven the economy.
overseas reserves would look a
lot more unsatisfactory than they
are at present if Mr. Luke had failed to
borrow substantial sums in Euro-dollars
and sterling in the past few months.
The sterling loan of £l2£ million was
at 1\ percent, so it will be seen that
Luke is having to pay through the nose
for the Government’s possible salvation.
Against this, when Mr. McMahon was
recently confronted with the alterna-
tives of floating a conversion loan in
London at this sort of interest rate or
paying off the maturing debt, he could
act from balance-of-payments and
reserves strengths and take the latter.
If Australia’s economic position is not
frustrating for Mr. McMahon (who
looks to be poised, despite the PM’s
silence, to give the economy a boost),
neither will or should it be for Mr.
Calwell or his shadow Treasurer, Mr.
Crean (who has already told a Trades
Hall seminar on price control that
measures are required to stop a drift
into recession).
It is quite different for Mr. Kirk,
N.Z.’s Labor leader. Mr. Kirk finds him-
self the victim of Mr. Luke’s politico-
economic strategy. Mr. Luke has done
hardly anything to check the buoyancy
of the N.Z. economy in the face
of reserves stringency this year, so
that electors will go to the polls in
full employment (at the latest count
only 570 people were unemployed in
N.Z. and there were more than 7000
notified vacancies). If, in seeking over-
seas loans to buttress overseas reserves,
Mr. Luke has not been acting in true
Micawber fashion, there is a faint re-
semblance in his policies. So far, apart
from the loans and the eleventh-hour
end to the British seamen’s strike, fate
has not been all that kind.
'J'HE “N.Z. Economist and Taxpayer”
(November issue) takes the hope-
ful view, on export prices, but they are
not reassuring enough to prevent the
journal saying that, even if more op-
timistic views about lamb and wool
prices mitigate the outlook, it is not
sufficiently optimistic to justify amend-
ment to the consistently gloomy view
of the overseas balance of payments
situation it has held for most of this
year. “It is now abundantly clear,” it
adds, “that just as soon as the Govern-
ment is returned (sic) it will have to
act with unseemly haste in curbing over-
seas expenditure. The first victim, we
suggest, will be overseas travel allow-
ances (following the usual British prac-
tice!), because this is one form of over-
seas spending which, unlike raw material
imports, can be cut without causing
unemployment.”
Mr. Luke has let the internal
economy run on to practically overfull
employment levels on the crude assump-
tion that the balance of payments will
right itself. This may be good political
strategy, but begs the main economic
issues facing New Zealand and in that
context lqok almost irresponsible.
Nobody has put these issues better than
Dr. W. B. Sutch in his “Colony or
Nation” (recently published by Sydney
University Press, $5.00). He says:
“The crisis for New Zealand in the
mid-1960s is not that the basis of our
wealth has suddenly gone. It has not
gone; and the trends that have produced
the crisis have not been sudden. The
crisis consists in this: the time in which
we can take remedial measures is get-
ting shorter and shorter; the longer we
delay these measures, the more the crisis
deepens. Rapid and radical action is
needed to readjust our economic struc-
ture and institutions to meet our new
development needs: the building of in-
dustry to supply raw materials, com-
ponents, and capital goods, and the
basing of our economy and society on a
broad range of skills. In all too many
respects we have been outpaced by a
large part of the developed world and
we may, for all we know, be in the
process of being outstripped by many
developing countries. These latter at
least recognise their problem—the need
to develop rapidly*— and they have the
will to try to solve it.”

J. C. HORSFALL'S MELBOURNE
Searching for the Light
INVESTIGATORS into declared
Victorian companies these last few
years have earned a high reputation
for painstaking devotion to duty and
brutal frankness. Now to the list of dis-
tinguished lawyers building this
tradition we have to add William
Charles Crockett, QC, a 42-year-old
Melburnian who since early last year
has been investigating Neon Signs (Aus-
tralasia) Ltd. His report, issued last
week, is crammed with shocking revel-
ations and hard words on what he calls
a “blot on the commercial history of
this State.”
The only mitigation of this attribution
to Victoria is that NSA is incorpor-
ated in N.S.W. But this avails little,
because the group’s head office was in
this State and twelve of the 35 sub-
sidiaries, including the biggest one, Mel-
bourne Neon Pty. Ltd., had Victorian
registration. Of the other subsidiaries,
only two were N.S.W. companies. The
others were: Queensland nine, S.A. four,
W.A. three, Tasmania one, N.Z. three,
and Britain one.
In a letter to the Attorney-General,
Mr. Crockett sums up his findings by
saying he has found “fraud, malprac-
tices, negligence, and accounting dis-
honesty unfortunately, great in
number and great in range.” There
couldn’t be anything more damning (in
the commercial sense) than that. In-
deed, he has probably given Mr. Rylah
more to work on than any of the reports
of investigators into other declared Vic-
torian companies since 1961. That is
saying something.
This is not a case in which debenture
holders are likely to suffer much, if at
all, and in this respect it resembles
Factors Ltd., whose 1958 debenture
prospectus was recently under scrutiny
for profit puffing allegations at the City
Court. Mr. Crockett thinks that the
debentures will shortly be repaid in full
and that unsecured creditors of the
parent company may expect something
back. However, he thinks the un-
secured creditors of the subsidiaries will
lose the greater part of what’s owing
to them and also that shareholders and
option holders of NSA will lose the
whole of their $4.8 million stake.
For obvious reasons I won’t discuss
the more sinister allegations posed by
Mr. Crockett. They are matters for
Mr. Rylah. At present it will suffice
to orient NSA in the serialised story of
company losses since 1960 in general.
Aoart from the dubious accounting tech-
niques coming under Mr. Crockett’s
searching microscope, this was- essen-
tially a case of a wild takeover orgy
that came unstuck. The diversification
into activities which were foreign to the
directors and management of NSA led
to the acquisition of a lot of weak
companies at excessive prices.
Mr. Crockett says the likelihood of
these ill-advised steps spelling untold
trouble for the group was brought home
as the management of the acquired
businesses proved defective and their
accounting control virtually non-
existent. As in the case of Reid Murray,
say, “huge amounts of cash were dis-
sipated in abortive and ill-advised
efforts to place poorly performed sub-
sidiaries on a profitable basis.” To cap
things off, the establishment of a head
office (in Melbourne) weighed down a
marginally viable group with over-
heads, not unlike, say, Testro Bros.
F the losses derived mainly from these
and accountancy directions, we
also have here a dominant personality,
one who embodies the sort of person
Mr. A. A. Forster had in mind in one
of a series of articles on company losses
in THE BULLETIN last year (the one
on August 7 is worth rereading in
particular): “If one had to nominate a
single common factor explanatory of
the losses,” he wrote, “it would be the
unfettered freedom of a dominant per-
sonality at top management (board)
level.” Mr. Forster added, “You correct
this by legislating for a shareholders’
advisory board for listed companies with
a function of internal auditing and sur-
veillance (What about it, AGs!).”
NSA had two such gentlemen, and of
them Mr. Crockett says bluntly, “The
acts of commercial negligence, financial
ineptitude, and accounting chicanery
which were connived at or indulged
in by Mr. Sykes and Mr. Campi in
order to preserve for NSA a false
appearance of prosperity were further
compounded by those gentlemen in
transactions involving fraud or breach
of trust.”
We have been hearing quite a bit
about the “puffing” of profits by de-
clared companies lately. Mr. Crockett
examines a number of angles on this,
which he alleges NSA developed to a
fault. One of these is the treatment
of preacquisition profits or losses after
a takeover. The important point, as he
states, is to remember that “when a
company already trading is acquired,
the shares being purchased usually
above or below par, all profits or losses
incurred by the subsidiary up to the
acquisition date are not revenue profits
or losses (as the case may be) to the
group, but are paid' for theoretically in
the price given for the shares.” In a
word, they are of a capital, not a
revenue, nature. As Mr. Crockett puts
it, “calculation of preacquisition profits
(or losses) is really only part of the
larger task of calculating ‘goodwill on
consolidation.’ ”

Interest in
Fixed Interest
INTEREST rates look pretty high
right now, but on company deben-
tures and notes they are even higher
than they look. This is not only because
the effective yield to the big institu-
tional investors from most of the recent
debenture issues carrying a 7f percent
coupon has been up around the 7.9
percent mark when discounts and other
gimmicks are taken into account.
The ordinary investor can also get
far better rates than the advertised
interest rates on new issues—by buying
existing debentures and notes in the
market. The only real problem in doing
this is that it is hard to get enough of
them.
But the rewards are significant and
not only for those where the risks are
high.
First to the safe ones. Investors seek-
ing to place their money on very short
terms can do much better buying un-
secured notes in strong industrial com-
panies like British Tobacco, J. Gadsden,
and Boral than new issues by the most
generous hire-purchase companies. Last
week J. Gadsden’s April, 1967, 8 percent
notes sold for $99.65, plus brokerage of
25 cents. This meant that investors
would receive a net 10 cents tax-free
capital appreciation and 4 dollars in-
terest within 5-| months —representing
an annual rate of better than 9 percent.
ON last week’s price of British
Tobacco 1\ percent October, 1967,
notes an investor stands to lose 50 cents
(including brokerage) on maturity, but
would receive 7 dollars interest for an
investment of 11J months —or better
than 7 percent per annum compared
with hire-purchase company rates of
little better than 6 percent.
On Boral 8 percent October, 1967,
notes, the return is even better. A capi-
tal profit of 50 cents after brokerage
and 8 dollars interest for an investment
lasting 11£ months would give an annual
rate of return of almost 9 percent.
Colonial Gas 6| percent May, 1967,
debentures give a net redemption, yield
of better than 8 percent per annum over
5£ months; Clyde Securities 7 percent
June, 19675, yield about 10 percent over
1\ months and, for those with a taste
for a bit of risk, Deposit and Invest-
ment 1\ percent June, 19675, yield a
net 12 percent per annum over 71-
months.
lAC’s September, 1968, maturities at
7 and 1\ percent both yield a net 8 per-
cent per annum for 22 months at last
week’s prices; Federal Hotel’s April,
1968, notes give a redemption yield of
about 11 percent per annum for 17
months, and the price of $BO reported
on A & I Discounters 8£ percent
August, 1968, notes gives a redemption
yield of better than 20 percent for those
willing to try it.

By JASON
Wtttt fr n £ , ,
HILE followers of the charts pre-
pare to meet their doom in the
market slump they see in their
crystal balls, many other stockmarket
experts are looking forward to a re-
covery in the New Year—and a leading
economist is talking about the next
. . j o t-u
What is an investor to do? The
answer seems to be that there is no
need to rush intc.anything—either sell-
ing or buying. There could be some
rises and some falls from individual
stocks in the next six months that could
be significant, but overall it seems un-
likely that there will be any early
boom or that things will be as bad as
the chartists suggest from their readings
of the current “bearish” trends in the
markets. THE BULLETIN’S chartist
has §et out below a list of stocks which
may need “reassessing” in the event of
a general market slide.
The gloom merchants can look to
. tt o i • . ,
the U.S. scene and point out that if the
U.S. economy does sneeze, as so many
are forecasting, one of the countries that
stands to catch cold is Japan. This could
have serious results for Australian
exports and therefore our level of
economic activity.
tj ,
u on the more cheerful side theie
are economic experts like Dr. Alan
Hall writing m the Financial Review’
that no additional Governmental action
is needed to stimulate the Australian
economy because all the stimulus that
the economy requires, perhaps more
than enough, is already in the pipeline,”
and that the Treasury should now be
“formulating its strategy for curbing
the next boom.”
Despite continuing easing tendencies
in share prices, institutions say that it
is very difficult to buy shares in any
quantity without having a strong
upward impact on the price; they say
that the market has been sliding on
little volume and, therefore, that any
real increase in demand for shares could
see a rapid rise in prices.
On the other hand, company profits
for the current year may not be too
good.
The most likely situation seems to
be that the market should keep bounc-
ing along the bottom for a while until
it can assure itself that the Government
does know how to handle the problem
of getting the economy back on the
move, until people begin to spend again,
until the already well-discounted threat
of a U.S. recession passes, and until
there is some evidence that interest
rates are on the turn.
IN view of the deterioration of the
technical position of the stock-
market in recent weeks, stocks
mentioned by the Chartist during the
past year have been reassessed in terms
of supply and demand, and the prob-
abilities of their future direction have
been indicated wherever possible. Un-
The Chartist says:
MR. LESLIE PARKER, who began
a three-week visit to Australia at
the Hamersley Iron opening last
week, is mining editor of London’s
“Financial Times,” writing a column
under the name of Lodestar. Before
Lodestar left London, he wrote a
column that appeared in print the day
he landed in Perth, looking back on his
many favorable comments about West-
ern Mining Corporation.
Last week he speculated about the
prospects of Western Mining being
taken over by one of the world’s min-
.ing giants, and asked what after
such a “lightning calendar of growth
possibilities”—might now be expected
of them. And his answer was cautious
indeed (all figures sterling): “Western
Mining, taking the recent issue into
account, now has 10.9 million shares on
issue to capitalise the whole undertaking
in the market, on a fully paid basis, at
£3O million, a sizeable figure indeed
for a company that is only currently
paying dividends at an annual rate
of around £250,000 from a profit which
was £277,000 for the 15 months to June
30 last . . .
“Here then is the picture as it stands
at present. Dare we still give the shares
our blessing? Were I a potential new
buyer I think I would be content to
stand on the sidelines at this present
moment when the bulls are rampant.
Technically, Western Mining seems due
for some reaction.
The reaction he forecast came
quickly. In the five trading days after
his column appeared the share price
had fallen 72 cents.
Investors still dazzled by WESTERN MINING CORPORATION’S nickel pros-
pects must surely be wondering just how high this stock is likely to go after the
meteoric rise which commenced in February, 1966, and has already taken prices
to a high point of $6.94 during the past week. The long-term trend on the chart
since 1960 shows that, after the almost vertical rise in 1961, a sideways consolidation
followed until the breakout on very heavy volume early this year. At this point,
the rise could continue to about the $8 level and the stock could be safely held
until a decisive penetration of 5 percent of the trendline, which has been tested
three times since the breakout. Last sale price 11/11/66 —$6.38.

‘The technical risk would now be con-
sidered high. Support would be strong
about the 40c level and the stock could
move up to about 50c if the market
turns bullish in the short term.
British Tobacco has achieved all base
projections indicated and in fact rose
to $2.46 (adjusted for stock split). It
now shows signs of topping and is un-
likely to hold any substantial rise ip
the short term.
BHP achieved the projection indi-
cated about $6.50 at the time of the
recommendation. Although the present
technical risk would be considered high,
it would be quite possible for this stock
to react to approximately the $5.50
level.
Broken Hill South would call for re-
assessment should sales fall back to
$2.60, but a short-term objective of
about $3.60 is indicated.
Comeng would be influenced by the
general tone of the market but the
stock should be sold if prices fall below
$1.06.
Deposit and Investment has perform-
ed well since the original recommenda-
tion, and a high point of 35c for the
year was recorded recently. The slock
is currently trading around the 30c
level, but a reaction back to the basic
trend line about 26c would now be
likely.
Dodge Consolidated could fall to
about $1.45 if the present support level
at $1.60 fails to hold. Investors should
remember that this stock is "basically in
a down trend.
Elder Smith G.M. would break a
trend line if sales were to fall to $2.35.
It would not be considered prudent to
hold this stock should this eventuate.
General Industries would need to
break a very strong resistance level at
$1.45 before any strong rise could be
recorded. Should sales fall below $1.20
in the short term, selling action would
be indicated.
James Hardie’s technical position has
weakened considerably since the original
recommendation, and it would be un-
wise to hold this stock should sales fall
below $4.76..'
Life' Savers rose to a high point of
$2.70 since the recommendation, but
any general market “bearishness” could
influence this stock’s future movements.
Philip Morris would be “testing” its
long-established uptrend line at $7, and
the risk would be very high at this
point. The stock should be sold if sales
fall below $6.75.
National Bag, which was included in
the Container group of stocks early this
year, now shows signs of weakening
further, and’ a decline to about the $1
level would be a distinct possibility. '
O.D.E. failed to break the resistance
level, and has since fallen rather sharply
back to about 51c, where fairly strong
support could be expected.
Petersville recently broke a promis-
ing uptrend, and now the possibility of
a fall to about 42c should be considered.
Rothmans has since fallen close to
the downside target of $2.40 as sales
have been recently recorded at $2.50.
The situation would call for reassess-
ment should sales fall below $2.30, as a
decline of a serious nature could fol-
low.
Steel Mills failed to break the resist-
ance level at 82c, and should not be held
if sales fall below 68c.
Srwan Brewery failed to confirm a
promising uptrend after rising as high
as $2.75 recently; it would be unwise
to hold this stock should prices fall be-
low $2.30 in the short term.
Winchcombe Carson could fall back


HIGHLIGHTS OF CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS
BROKEN HILL
SOUTH LIMITED
360 Collins Street, Melbourne, Australia
The Chairman of Broken Hill South Limited, Mr. G. Lindesay
Clark, in his address to stockholders at the Company’s Annual
General Meeting on Monday, 7th November, 1966, said:
FINANCIAL. The consolidated net
profit of the Broken Hill South Limited
group of companies amounted to
$A3,222,000, and the net profit of
the parent company amounted to
$A3,360,000. A dividend of 6 cents
per stock unit has been declared pay-
able on 2nd December, 1966.
FUNDS FOR CAPITAL WORKS.
Capital works, in preparing for the
treatment of residue dumps, and at
Cobar in furthering the development
programme at the C.S.A. Mine, ab-
sorbed approximately $A3,000,000.
Mr. G. Lindesay Clark
Overall the funds utilised in the year were provided from internal
cash flow, short term borrowings and from bank overdraft accom-
modation. No major commitments have been entered for capital
works at Broken Hill and Cobar for the remainder of the current
financial year.
OPERATIONS AT BROKEN HILL. It is intended during the
current year to mine 220,000 tons of ore from No. 7 shaft and
Browne Shaft sections at the South Mine. In addition, it is ex-
pected that up to 200,000 tons of residues will be treated from the
old Mt. Hebbard dump in the new plant installed to treat residues.
The programme of exploration within the company’s mining
leases at Broken Hill has been continued.
COBAR MINES PTY. LTD. Production from the copper ore-
bodies commenced in July, 1965, on a limited scale. The installa-
tion of the second section of the concentrator to treat copper ore,
and equipment for the extraction of zinc from copper-zinc ore, has
recently been completed. This will permit a gradual increase in
production rate to full capacity, which is expected to be in excess
of 700,000 tons per annum. Revised estimates of the combined
C.S.A. Mine and Chesney Mine ore potential to the depth drilled
of 3,200 feet, indicates some 27 million tons of ore. Development
at Cobar will continue to be concentrated at the C.S.A. Mine for
some time.
The objective now is to bring production to capacity of the plant
at about 60,000 tons per month. At present the rate of production
is approaching 40,000 tons ore per month and the mine is operat-
ing at a net profit.
MINERAL EXPLORATION. Broken Hill South Limited, in
association with other parties under Agreements, and on its own
account, has actively pursued the search for mineral deposits to
the south-west of Broken Hill, and at many other locations
throughout the Commonwealth of Australia. At Kapunda, in
South Australia, further drilling confirmed the earlier low and
uneconomic nature of the mineralisation. However, above this
zone an oxidised copper prospect to a depth of 300 feet below
surface has been indicated and is being further tested.
In the Lake Torrens area of S.A., Broken Hill South Limited has
carried out extensive geochemical reconnaissance which has dis-
closed metal values over several extensive areas, and systematic
prospecting is proceeding.
DISCOVERY OF PHOSPHATE DEPOSITS. Exploration for
the more important non-metallic minerals, particularly phosphate
and asbestos, has been continued. The search had resulted in the
discovery of major phosphate deposits located some 90 miles
S.S.W. of Cloncurry in North West Queensland.
Commercial grade ore outcrops intermittently within one area
some 15 miles in length and up to 3 miles in width. In addition,
a second location, some miles away, contained commercial assays.
Several outcropping sections up to 40 ft. thickness have been
examined in the main area, which are not necessarily the same
horizon. Geological data within the area suggests the significant
sedimentary horizon is of greater thickness, in which a number
of economic beds may occur.
Some hundreds of samples from outcrops have been assayed and
a high percentage are of commercial grade. The deposits are simi-
lar in type to those of the major producers in the Mediterranean
and Central U.S.A. The systematic prospecting of the extent and
grade of the beds is about to begin. Concurrently with this, exami-
nation of the engineering and associated problems of bringing
the deposit into production will be undertaken.
It is clear that large outputs can be easily achieved from these
deposits. Their location and the price of the product (approxi-
mately $l7 per ton at Australian ports) indicate that large output
will be needed for commercial operation and commensurate
investment will be required.
The discovery is of special interest to the whole of Australia’s
pastoral and agricultural industry. There is likewise a growing
use of phosphate throughout the world, and consequently a
steady expanding market can be expected.
BEACH PETROLEUM N.L. Through its 17.5% interest in
Beach Petroleum, Broken Hill South Limited has continued its
interest in oil exploration. Beach Petroleum is conducting oil
exploration in St. Vincent Gulf, S.A., in the Menamurtie Hills,
N.S.W., and in New Zealand through a subsidiary company.
THE ELECTROLYTIC REFINING AND SMELTING COM-
PANY OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED. The E.R.&S. Company in
which Broken Hill South has a 60% interest completed a satis-
factory year reporting a net profit of $A 1,068,000. A contract has
been signed under which E.R.&S. will refine blister copper by the
Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company Ltd. for a period of
seven years.
ALCOA OF AUSTRALIA PROPRIETARY LIMITED. Alcoa
is producing, on an increasing scale, a broad range of products of
world standard quality. With the development of its semi-fabri-
cating facilities the company has secured a growing share of the
Australian market for aluminium sheet, plate, foil and extrusions.
Semi-fabricated products are also being sold in the world market.
Western Aluminium N.L., a subsidiary of Alcoa, has a long-term
contract to supply American Metal Climax Inc., of U.S.A., with
200,000 metric tons of alumina annually.
The expansion programme at Kwinana is now nearing comple-
tion. Alumina was also shipped to Mitsubishi Chemical Industries
Limited, Japan, as well as to the Point Henry aluminium smelter.
BROKEN HILL ASSOCIATED SMELTERS PTY. LTD. One
of Broken Hill South's important shareholdings is its 20% inter-
est in Broken Hill Associated Smelters Pty. Ltd., at Pt. Pirie.
B.H.A.S. has under construction a new plant to treat blast fur-
nace slag for the recovery of zinc, estimated to cost SAIS million.
The slag fuming plant will be brought into production by mid
1967 and the electrolytic zinc plant about 6 months later.
METAL MARKETS AND TRENDS. The trend of world con-
sumption of metals from which Broken Hill South derives its
revenue is steadily upward in line with increasing economic ac-
tivity throughout the world. On the other hand supply to the
market tends to vary as new mines come into production, are
expanded, or old mines close.
In consequence supply and demand from time to time get out of
step and this results in wide movement of prices. There is increas-
ing recognition that overall this may not be in the best interests
of the industry and, consequently, there is growing readiness to
try to bring supply and demand into closer relationship and many
discussions have taken place on the subject. Broken Hill South
Limited has participated in such discussions and has continued
its association with other parties to endeavour to maintain the
zinc price at a level competitive with substitute materials.
CONCLUSION. The last five years have been for the Company
a period of intensive development which began with the share
issue in 1961 which raised $A6,000,000.
During these five years Broken Hill South Limited has
• taken over and developed the Browne Shaft section at Broken
Hill and erected the Mt. Hebbard treatment plant, totalling in
all approximately $A2,600,000.
• contributed $A7,400,000 for shares in Alcoa of Australia Pty.
Limited.
• contributed $A11,700,000 for shares in Cobar Mines Pty. Ltd.
• maintained an active exploration programme, the new phos-
phate discovery in Queensland being a direct and important
result.
Funds for this large programme have come from the 1961 share
issue, the sales of shares held in companies not directly concerned
with the company’s mining and metallurgical activities, together
with cash flow from retained earnings consequent upon the high
level of met.al forces in the period, and bank overdraft and short
term borrowings amounting to $A2,300,000.
The major projects are only now beginning or about to begin
earning, and so have not yet contributed to the Company’s profits.
The developments of the last few years have diversified the sour-
ces of revenue, but of course leave the Company still dependent
on metal prices. If regard is had to the steadily increasing rate of
consumption of all metals, stockholders may not view this cir-
cumstance with any concern.
The Broken Hill South Group of Companies includes: Cobar Mines Proprietary Limited • Mines Exploration Proprietary Limited
• The Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company of Australia Limited

A.O.G. A warning was given recently
when this stock fell back toward the base
level. As this has now been pene-
trated the stock is likely to fall to about
$1.85 and has a more pessimistic target
of about $1.50.
Iron Ore
Implications
THE Japanese trade Press holds a
position with no real parallel in
Australia. According to your
viewpoint it peddles either suspicious
commercial gossip or authoritative
ahead-of-the-news information. For the
many who have a high regard for the
“Japan Commerce Daily,” its claims
about some aspects of the Mount New-
man group’s intentions are disturbing.
It claims that the operators of the
Mount Newman iron ore project told
the Japanese they would postpone until
January 7 their presentation of a report
to the Western Australian Government
on the contents of the contract they
recently concluded with the Japanese
steelmakers.
The implication they draw from this:
that Mount Newman cannot make all
the facts known because it would be
obvious how big their problems are in
raising funds for development of the
mine, and this might jeopardise the
project. Also, the paper claims, execu-
tives of a Japanese steel mill said at a
Press conference that Mount Newman
would embark on development of the
iron mine before getting approval of the
State Government.
However, a more far-reaching and
serious claim was dropped quietly into
a statement from the leader of a mill
group, following questions from NKK
and Kobe about Port Hedland’s capa-
city. This capacity has been stretched
by the Mount Newman group increasing
the planned throughput, a situation Mt.
Goldsworthy was quick to point out
since they had started the port as an
iron ore outlet. They have a six-year
contract to supply the Japanese through
Port Hedland and, in normal circum-
stances, might have expected to land
another contract; their mine, although
relatively small, has a 30-year life on
the rate of present operations.
But the Japanese mill chief is quoted
as saying that Port Hedland would be
a problem only until the Dresent Mount
Goldsworthy contract ran out in 1972.
This is the year Mount Newman’s out-
put rises to 7.5 million tons on top of
Mount Goldsworthy’s 2.5 million.
“From the next year afterward there
will be no more shipment of Mount
Goldsworthy ore amounting to nearly
2.5 million tons.” In other words, he
implied that Mount Newman’s in-
creased throughput had chopped Mount
Goldsworthy out of the market, at least
if they both continue to use Hedland.
If this is right, it would be one of
the factors behind the recent and un-
successful last-minute counter-offer of
Goldsworthy and Hamersley, who
undertook to supply the 100 million
tons of ore contracted for sale by
Mount Newman. Again, if it is right,
the Mount Newman contract is being
bundled through at an increasingly high
cost to the area’s stability and broad
base.
M E , A NWHI L E, another major
development in the Pilbara seems
imminent. The Cliffs consortium are
soon to announce whether or not they
have made a go of their pelletising
arrangements now that BHP have for-
saken their planned port partnership
in order to manage Mount Newman.
They have been extremely active behind
the scenes and seem far more happy
about their solo arrangement than they
did about the joint effort, perhaps
because of the technological break-
through that has been mentioned.
The original scheme, with its high
capital costs only partly offset by the
cost-sharing, was economically dubious.
So any new scheme would mean a
broadening far beyond the original
framework to ensure sound economics
for rail and port.
JJOWEVER, Goldsworthy and Cliffs
were out of the spotlight last
week as 260 - odd VIPs from all
over the world were wined and dined
on Madigan Stew guests of Hamers-
ley Iron at the official opening of the
Dampier project. This was essentially
a stunt aimed at interesting potential
buyers in what could be done at Mount
Tom Price and Dampier, and some
interesting comments emerged.
First, chairman Sir Maurice Mawby
made it clear Hamersley intended to
be BHP’s first competitor in steel, prob-
ably with a steel mill using solid fuel
(rather than oil or natural gas of the
newer technologies) at Dampier—cer-
tainly well before the 1990 s target set
by the State Government. The
managing director, Mr. Russel T.
Madigan, pointed out that Hamersley
next year would be exporting 800,000
tons of ore to British and Continental
buyers.
There was a ticklish moment or two
as a Japanese journalist haltingly asked
about Hamersley’s plans to set up a
pellet plant in Japan rather than Aus-
tralia an idea new to the Austra-
lians. But this was parried by the
urbane Mr. Val Duncan, chairman of
RTZ, parent company of Hamersley.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
ICIANZ's Earnings Trends
DURING the month of October,
ICIANZ Limited shares fell to
the lowest level for the past fiye
years and were being traded at prices
22 percent lower than a year ago. In
the year to March 31, 1966, net profit
before tax, depreciation, and interest
on debentures and fixed term loans
was up about 6 percent on the same
figure for the year to September 30,
1965, and external sales were up nearly
10 percent. These figures would sug-
gest that margins have slipped a little.
As average paid capital increased by
11.5 percent over the same period, it
is likely that investors are getting a
little concerned about the trend in
earnings per share.
We have some time to wait for the
results of the company’s financial year
which ended a month ago, but at this
juncture it seems that per share earn-
ings could well be lower than 1964-65
and will probably be of the order of
17 cents per share. In this event, the
share will still be selling at 20.5 times
earnings on the basis of the last sales
of $3.49 and the results of the past
five years have not shown any worth-
while improvement in per share earn-
ings. If a longer period is taken, and
if adjustments are made in respect of
new issues and low tax provisions, the
following trend appears:
1958 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
1958=100 100 67 92 91 91 75 73
In complete contrast, the trend in
dividends per share, also after adjust-
ments for new issues, has been in the
opposite direction.
1958 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
1958=100 100 113 115 124 130 131 135
This series would suggest that divi-
dends per share are just keeping ahead
of the fall in the value of money for,
over this period, dividends have been
increasing at an average rate of about
3.8 percent compound. However, un-
less the direction of the trend in per
share earnings changes in the short
term, there is every possibility that
the growth in per share dividends will
come to an end.
F is also evident that, over the past
few years, net profit before tax, de-
preciation, and interest as a percentage
of sales has tended to decline and this
is probably due to the lower world
prices that have been obtainable for
many basic chemicals. These low prices
would have meant that overseas pro-
ducers have been able to under-cut
ICIANZ’s prices on the local Aus-
tralian market.
The inquiry into the chemical in-
dustry by the Tariff Board started in
1963 and the report has recently been
tabled in Federal Parliament. In-
creased tariffs have been recommended
and approved over a wide range of
chemicals and it would seem that
ICIANZ must benefit. The extent of
the benefit cannot be determined at
this stage, any more than it is possible
to assess the benefits from the sub-
stantial new plants that are currently
being built by the group or have been
completed within the past 12 months
or so.
With a view to gaining some idea
of the trend in profitability to capital
employed, I have calculated the re-
turn on capital employed but taking in
fixed assets at cost or valuation instead
of the written-down value. In other
words, depreciation has been regarded
as part of retained earnings for this
purpose. The pre-tax and depreciation
return on these funds has progressed
as follows:
1959 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
Percent 14.9 12.0 12 3 11 5 13.1 10 1
1959=100 100 80 82 77 88 68
The last figure assumes that the
figure for the year to March 31, 1966,
will be the same as the figure for the
year to September 30, 1966.
ir pHE expansion program is still con-
tinuing, for it was announced only
six weeks ago that ICIANZ was seeking
another $lO million from an issue of
debentures with currencies of seven,
15, and 20 years and on June 1 last the
final call on the partly paid shares
arising from the April, 1965, issue was
made. This call would have brought in
more than $6.9 million. On the basis
that these new funds will earn only 10
percent before tax and depreciation, net
profit before tax could increase by
about 6 percent in 1966-67.
This would mean a similar increase
in earnings on a “notional” basis but,
in fact, earnings will depend on the
amount of tax which is saved on in-
vestment allowances. Merely to keep
per share earnings at the 1964-65 level,
group earnings in 1966-67 will need
to be 19 percent higher than they were
in 1964-65. As, at this stage, it looks
as though 1965-66 earnings may be only
fractionally higher, quite a substantial
rise will be needed during the current
financial year.
It has been suggested that the Aus-
tralian chemical industry will remain
an “infant” industry permanently. That
is, protection will be needed in per-
petuity if reasonable profits are to be

should be compared with APM rather
than BHP. If this was so, the price of
the shares would be considerably lower
than it is at the moment. As it is, a
shareholder who purchased his shares
at the average price for the 1958 cal-
endar year and who maintained a
constant investment (sold rights to new
issues to take up the balance) would
today have lost 5 percent on his capital.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Brewery and building issues were mostly under some pressure
from “special circumstances” during the week. Among other
quality industrials, suspicion continues to surround Minster,
which suffered a further 30 cent drop to finish at $2.15. West-
ern Mining’s plunge seemed to be stemmed at the end, but
the week’s loss was still 46 cents to $6.38. A promising future
brought Mount Morgan up 11 cents to $2.90. AOG added five
cents to touch $2.


BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
No Liquids at Lindemans
FOR the first time in years, the most
striking thing about vigneron
Lindeman (Holdings) Ltd. is not
that it has made another bonus share
issue; it is that the company’s financial
position has undergone a staggering
change.
Lindeman fans should not be too
depressed about 1965-66’s paltry 4 per-
cent rise in pre-tax profits or the fact
that the balance sheet shows the com-
pany is running out of cash, or that
under the impact of investment allow-
ances tax fell even further as a pro-
portion of pre-tax profit to only 26 per-
cent, so accounting for more than a
third of the net profit rise. For that
was the cost of the rapid expansion of
1965-66; an expansion that brought an
almost 40 percent addition to fixed
assets (up $685,000 before deprecia-
tion), and that brought a corresponding
40 percent rise in depreciation provided
from the latest year’s profit'.
The most important thing about the
expansion is that it has not yet had its
major impact on profits. For not only
has the company written off all the
expenditure incurred during the year in
planting new vines and preparation of
vineyard lands for new plantings and
replanting out of current year profits,
but Lindemans has greatly increased
its area of one- to three-year-old new
vines that did not contribute to last
year’s profits in any real way.
At this Wednesday’s meeting, the
chairman, Mr. M. P. Webber, may be
encouraged to dilate on what further
capital moves the company has in mind
following the recent bonus, which was
described as an “initial” step toward
expanding the company’s capital. If
Lindemans has any more rapid ex-
pansion in mind it could be on the
lookout for more cash and a cash
issue could be one way of both “recti-
fying” the low capitalisation and pro-
viding some money for expansion. But
with no long-term debt at all in the
company and with freehold property
in the books at $1.2 million, fixed-
interest borrowings would be a cheaper
method.
iA T . last year’s annual meeting the
chairman said he hoped to finance
the planned expansion “substantially
from our own resources.” But these
have now been run down; last year the
company spent about $900,000 from
its own resources and now has no more
readily disposable assets left.
During the year the company sold
the $lBO,OOO worth of investments in
unstated companies at unstated prices
(no mention of any profit or loss on
sales of assets in the profit and loss
account); it disposed of $lOO,OOO worth
of Commonwealth Bonds; it turned a
credit at the bank of $208,000 into an
overdraft of $120,000, and used up
its cash flow of $320,000. This year,
apart from a cash flow that is likely to
be much larger, the company will not
have the same volume of funds avail-
able from internal sources.
The 1965-66 annual report signifi-
cantly avoided repeating last year’s
comments about “considerable capital
expenditure,” so suggesting an easing
rate of spending. But even if this is
so, the company still had capital ex-
penditure of $170,000 committed at
June 30.
Last year’s capital expenditure was
due to “the impressive increase in sales”
during the year and since June, 1965
(to the end of October, 1965). This
year the directors’ report does not men-
tion sales, although wine stocks have
jumped by 17 percent, debtors have
risen 15 percent, and trade creditors
are up nine percent, all suggesting in-
creasing business—but perhaps not as
much more as could have been hoped
following the Rouge Homme takeover.
Lindemans has traditionally been a
heavy purchaser of grapes from inde-
pendent growers, but has now clearly
set out on a program of building up
its own vineyards by development and
takeover. The total cost of last
year’s Rouge Homme purchase (giving
an additional winery, a large vineyard,
and 300 acres for future expansion) has
not been revealed, apart from the
$60,000 share exchange portion of the
mainly cash deal, but it has resulted
in a hefty $lOB,OOO increase in good-
will.
The latest net result of $450,000 was
far and away its best and about 2-£
times the 1962 net. Each year has
shown steady profit progress, and the
policy of making moderate bonuses
every other year has not scaled the
earning rate down drastically. The
source of the bonuses has largely been
the share premiums collected from
original shareholders when the holding
company was formed in October, 1959.
Shareholders in the previous Lindeman
Ltd. were offered two shares in the
new company for each one held in the
old, and the new shares carried a 100
percent premium. The company an-
nounced at the time that the premium
provided a basis for issuing shares tax-
free in the hands of the recipient.
So far they have received, since 1960,
two two-for-fives and, at the end of
last month, a one-for-seven bonus,
which, together with a one percent lift
in dividend to 16 percent in 1966 (which
directors hope to maintain), have given
long-term shareholders a 138 percent
increase in income and a 316 percent
increase in market value of their in-
vestment.
Takeover of the ailing Leo Buring
in 1962 (now restored to profitability)
and Rouge Homme in July, 1965, re-
inforced the share premium account,
and even after the 1966 bonus, there is
still $212,625 in kitty. Add to this a
1965 revaluation of properties by
$410,000 and there is $622,625 for
future largesse.
Lindeman’s issued capital after the
last bonus is $1,621,978, and it has
eight vineyards and wineries, situated
in four areas. They are the Felton vine-
yard at Hopefield and Southern Cross
at Balldale in the Corowa district, with
a winery; the Sunshine vineyard at
Branxton, and the Ben Ean and Cool-
alta vineyards near Pokolbin in the
Hunter Valley, with a winery at Bert
Ean. Leo Buring’s Florita vineyard at
Watervale, near Clare, and its Chateau
Leonay vineyard and winery at Tan-
unda in South Australia make and
merchandise wines of a different style
to Lindeman’s traditional wines.
Acquisition last year of the Rouge
Homme vineyard and winery at Coona-
warra in south-east South Australia
strengthened the red wine side of the
business, although that vineyard does
produce a sprinkling of whites.
Leo Buring was a rundown firm in
which Lindeman saw some profit for
its own shareholders and the takeover
established Lindeman in South Aus-
tralia.
the only two public vignerons in
Australia, Lindemans and Penfolds
Wines Australia Ltd. are reluctant to
give production or sales figures. Pen-
folds is much the larger, though, in
profitability, Lindemans this last year
was closing the gap.
Installation of the more modern
equipment by Lindemans substantially
improved the 1966 yield of juice. The
tonnage of grapes crushed was a record,
the Hunter River crop , was the highest
since 1948, and the quality of the 1966
vintages was “not only of the high
standard usually associated with a
drought year, but actually superb.”
Australian table wine production in-
creased some 55 percent in the six
years to 1963-64, but per capita con-
sumption of wines, both fortified and
table, is still less than 1J gallons. (The
French on average drink 17 times as
much.)
For continued excellence as an in-
vestment, the market will be looking
for bonuses such as a one-for-eight,
one-for-nine, and one-for-ten over the
next five or six years, which would dis-
burse the present capital reserves and
bring capital to $2.2m. so long as
Lindemans can support this capital
growth with ever-increasing earnings.

MINING
Local Sources of Lithium
THIS year has been an exciting one
in the history of Australia’s
mineral development, and in par-
ticular for two members of the Collins
House group, Western Mining Corpora-
tion Ltd. and Broken Hill South Ltd.
Firstly, in February came Western
Mining’s now famous nickel discovery
at Kambalda. Then late last month
South announced the discovery of a
major deposit of phosphate rock near
Cloncurry. These discoveries are of
national importance in view of the fact
that Australian requirements for both
nickel and phosphate rock have in the
past been met almost entirely from
imports.
These two companies are also inves-
tigating, on a 50-50 basis, the possibility
of mining lithium deposits held by
WMC and the economics of produc-
tion of lithium concentrates and chemi-
cals. Although lithium is of -relatively
minor importance by comparison with
nickel and phosphate rock, virtually all
Australian requirements of lithium
materials have to be imported.
Small quantities of lithium ore have
been produced, mostly intermittently, in
New South Wales, Western Australia,
and the Northern Territory. Import
data have not been separately recorded
since 1960-61, when total imports of
lithium compounds were valued at
$92,000_ f.o.b. If we assume a growth
rate of 5 'percent per annum in Aus-
tralian consumption of these com-
pounds, 1965-66 imports could be
around $llB,OOO f.o.b. or about
250,0001 b. in lithium hydroxide equival-
ent.
rpms is probably a conservative guess
in view of estimates that the U.S.
domestic market for lithium ores and
compounds has been growing at the rate
of about 14 percent per annum since
1960 to a present level of 14,000,0001 b.
in lithium hydroxide equivalent. U.S.
consumption is expected to increase by
a further 300 percent in the next
decade.
What is the background to this tre-
mendous growth in consumption?
Lithium, which is the lightest solid
element known to man, was considered
rare for many centuries, but is now one
of the most widely used of all minerals.
It is marketed mainly in the form of
chemical compounds, but also as an
ore-and-concentrate. Over 60 percent
of lithium materials are used by the
glass and ceramics industries. Lithium
reduces the viscosity and improves the
thermal strength and electrical proper-
ties of glass; it adds resistance to ther-
mal shock and lowers the firing tem-
perature of ceramics.
Other important uses for lithium
materials are in lubricating greases,
absorption-type air-conditioners, alka-
line storage batteries, welding fluxes
and brazing alloys, sanitizers, bleaches,
fuels, and pharmaceuticals.
New markets for lithium are con-
stantly being found. Dow Chemical
Co. has recently developed a mag-
nesium base alloy containing 14 per-
cent lithium and 1.25 percent
aluminium, the lightest structural alloy
commercially available, being half the
weight of aluminium and 30 percent
lighter than any other magnesium
alloy. This alloy was used in making
the Agena space vehicle.
Another potential use arises from
the development by U.S. technologists
of working lithium batteries and lithium
cells. Gulton Industries, of New Jersey,
recently announced the development
of a 2501 b. lithium battery which could
power a compact electric car for 150
miles between charges. This battery
has a theoretical capability of 600-watt
hours per lb. and realised capability
of 100-watt hours per lb., compared
with Ford’s 150-watt hours per lb.
sodium sulphur cell and much lower
capabilities for other batteries developed
to date. General Motors is also work-
ing- on the development of a lithium
chlorine fuel cell.
The Western Mining-Souths’ joint
investigations into the potential of
lithium production can therefore be
viewed against a favorable background
in world consumption trends. Western
Mining, the joint operator for the pro-
ject, has been testing lithium prospects
in Western Australia for the past few
years. Most of the testing to date
has been on spodumene ones, one of
the four main lithium bearing ores
and, by world standards, the most im-
portant; the other three ores are
amblygonite, lepidolite, and petalite,
all of which have been found and mined
on a small scale in Australia.
Drilling at the spodumene deposits
held by Western Mining at Mount
Marion, 25 miles south-west of Kal-
goorlie, has indicated reserves of 1.49
million tons of ore assaying 1.67 per-
cent lithia (LiaO) or 540,000 tons assay-
ing 1.92 percent LiaO. Additional lower-
grade reserves are known to exist in the
area. Drilling at the other spodumene
prospect at Cattlin Creek, one mile
north of Ravensthorpe, has indicated
reserves of 1.25 million tons containing
16 percent spodumene. This would
probably mean an overall grade of just
under 1.3 percent LbO.
By comparison, the world’s largest
deposit of spodumene, which is in a 30-
mile long and one-mile wide spodu-
mene tin belt on the border of North
and South Carolina, assays about 1.5
percent Li»o. It is the largest source of
lithia in the U.S. The Foote Mineral
Co., which controls at least 50 percent
of the indicated ore reserves in this belt,
had measured reserves of 20 million
tons in 1964 and additional indicated
reserves of nearly 16 million tons. Inci-
dentally, Foote Mineral Co. has recently
developed a new low-iron spodumene
concentrate. Previously the relatively
high-iron content of spodumene had
limited its use by the glass and ceramics
industries.
Western Mining and Souths are also
exploring for the low-iron lithium min-
erals lepidolite and petalite, the lithia
content of these ores being 3.8 percent
and 4.2 percent respectively. Four
mineral claims for lithium and asso-
ciated pegmatite minerals were applied
for earlier this year in the Londonderry
district, about 20 miles south of Cool-
gardie. Petalite has been mined in this
district for some years as a co-
product of felspar and beryl mining by
Australian Glass Manufacturers Co.
Pty. Ltd. Columbite, an ore of tantalum,
also occurs in pegmatites in this area
QURRENT Australian prices for lith-
ium ores are not quoted, but aver-
age prices received in 1964 were $3.64
and $6.74 per unit of LhO is petalite
(f.o.r Londonderry) and spodumene
(f.o.b. Esperance) respectively. By com-
parison, current London prices f.o.b.
Beira are equivalent to $A.8.75 and
$A.9.40 per unit of LhO respectively.
Western Australian petalite sold at the
above prices assayed 4.2 percent LBO
per ton, while spodumene sold assayed
6 percent. Western Mining has carried
out flotation tests on its spodumene
deposits at both Mount Marion and
Cattlin Creek. These tests have indi-
cated that spodumene concentrates con-
taining 6 percent LbO could be readily
produced.
Although on the limited information
available it is difficult to make esti-
mates of the profitability of the joint
lithium venture, the prospects must be
considered encouraging in view of the
statement made by WMC last Febru-
ary. The decision to secure the option
over the Cattlin Creek deposit and to
apply for the Londonderry areas was
made “on consideration of the present
and future markets for the sale of
lithium concentrates.”
It would seem that operations, per-
haps based initially at Mount Marion,
would need to be on a scale similar to
that at Kambalda (100,000 tons of
ore annual throughout), but profit-
ability will be largely dependent on the
type of mining methods employed. If
largely open-cut mining is carried out,
then pre-tax earnings could be in the
vicinity of $500,000 per annu,m, rising
as the scale of operations is increased.
If, however, associated pegmatite
minerals could be produced as co-
products, as has been the case at Lon-
donderry, profitability would be de-
cidedly enhanced.

COMMODITIES
From Mt. Newman
to Mt. Gibson
THE reported decision by the Japan-
ese steel mill Nippon Kokan
Kaisha not to take its share of the
Mt. Newman iron ore supply may re-
flect developments at its own Australian
ore venture. Although “disputes” among
Japanese steel mills are not always what
they appear, in this case it seems that
NKK has finally moved to quit the
group buying Newman ore.
Through an associate, the Kokan
Mining Co., NKK has, with T. Kaki-
achi and Co., an option over deposits
at Mt. Gibson, 100-odd miles from
the coast, midway between Geraldton
and Kwinana. Earlier this year there
was talk of a plant to produce two mil-
lion tons of pellets a year (proposals
were to be put to the W.A. Govern-
ment by mid-year).
Reserves at Mt. Gibson are at least
30 million tons of ore rich enough for
direct shipping and 112 million tons
suitable for beneficiation. However, re-
ports indicate that the reserves of lower-
grade ore are much greater than pub-
lished figures indicate. “World Mining”
recently suggested that six million tons
a year could be mined and pelletised
from the large reserves. The area is well
situated for transport, with good ports
available.
NKK is not a giant among Japanese
steel mills; and, anyway, it would be
unlikely to limit itself to one source of
supply. But development of the Mt.
Gibson deposits would add a new
element to the competition for the Jap-
anese market.
LONDON cocoa prices have lost
ground from their short-lived peak
of £stg2lo a ton reached some
months ago. But at present levels above
£l7O a ton there are signs of a level
trend—good news for chocolate makers
and for Pacific island growers.
Present prices are well above last
year’s low and are providing compen-
sation to growers, who have been
affected by lower copra prices. For the
manufacturers, price fluctuations are
more important than actual levels
(within limits), for variations in size
of standard chocolate blocks can com-
pensate for raw material costs.
Markets held steady last week despite
a U.S. Department of Agriculture fore-
cast that world output in 1966-67 would
rise 12 percent to 1,377,700 metric
tons (of 22041 b.). The latest forecast
still leaves a gap of about 30,000 tons
between estimated output and consump-
tion, however, to be filled from stocks.
Much of the recent weakness in cocoa
prices has been due to speculative sell-
ing, following the strong gains after last
year’s slump. Sustained buying by man-
facturers who had run down stocks has
met selling by dealers.

DURING the land boom, Parliament
became a sort of land speculators’
club, where the most blatant “log-
rolling”—the use of political power for
private gain—became commonplace.
Fantastic sums were borrowed and spent
on extending the railway network; and
when the rails reached any particular
point, it was often found that syndi-
cates of MPs and their associates had
bought up the land in advance for sub-
division and resale.
Fairly typical of the companies
formed by MPs was the Country Estates
Co. Ltd., which proposed to subdivide
land covered by thick scrub near the
railway line at Neerim, Gippsland. The
major shareholders were four members
of the Legislative Assembly J. F.
Levien, A. C. Groom, Matthew Davies,
and J. H. McColl; and two members
of the Legislative Council Sir Ben-
jamin Benjamin and Henry Gore. The
Government was persuaded that it was
essential to build a station in the area,
so the Railways Department bought six
acres from the company at thirty times
the original price. The Government was
also persuaded to build a metalled road
through the scrub. The blocks were sold
by A. C. Groom, MLA, an auctioneer
who represented the district in Parlia-
ment. For years the area remained as
weed-covered paddocks, but eventually
became the township of Neerim South.
brilliant barrister and journalist,
the ambitious and practised poli-
tician Alfred Deakin was appointed
Chief Secretary and Acting Premier in
1886. Radical, yet not radical, Deakin
soon showed'that as a Cabinet Minister
he was not the man to prosecute the
authors of financial disaster with any
vigor. The reasons are not hard to find.
Deakin was too closely involved with
several of the biggest land boomers to
be very interested in checking their
meteoric careers. For instance, Deakin
became chairman of the City of Mel-
bourne Building Society when Sir
Matthew Davies retired from that posi-
tion. Deakin was also a director of
James Munro’s Australian Property &
Investment Co. Ltd. when it crashed.
Ambition, if not desire for a quick for-
tune, makes strange bedfellows. Thus
in 1888 we see Deakin becoming foun-
dation chairman of the Australian City
& Suburban Investment & Banking Co.
Ltd. This company with its grandilo-
quent title floated on the stock market
and asked the public to subscribe no
less than £5 million for its shares. Its
purpose was to take over the properties
of G. W. Taylor, a land-booming
Mayor of Prahran* who had engorged
35,000 acres of land and was suffering
serious financial indigestion as a result.
How Dpakin ca,me to be so closely
associated with Taylor and his crew
remains one of the mysteries which the
future Prime Minister never revealed.
The best guess is that it was through
his close friend Theodore Fink. The
firm of Fink, Best & Phillips acted as
legal advisers to Taylor’s great boom
company, which ruined thousands of
people when it crashed.
F. T. Derham, MLA for Port Mel-
bourne, was Postmaster-General. Der-
ham had married Frances Swallow, and
become managing director of her
father’s biscuit manufactory, Swallow &
Ariell Ltd. But Frederick’s world was
not circumscribed by biscuits, or even
politics. In a colossal, outrageous, series
of land-boom transactions, he went
bankrupt for £550,000, made a secret
composition with his creditors, paid Id.
in the £l, and gracefully retired from
Parliament.
Sir Matthew Davies, MLA for Too-
rak, and Speaker during the Munro

Melbourne Punch, September 27, 1888
Government’s period of office, was not
the greatest of speculator's on his own
account. His personal debts totalled a
.mere £280,000 when he went bank-
rupt.
Benjamin Josman Fink, MLA for
Maryborough, was the real epitome of
the era. Nobody else, with the possible
exception of Sir Mathew Davies, started
so many billowing companies, borrowed
so heavily, speculated so widely, failed
so disastrously, or left such a swathe of
ruin and despair. Fink’s biggest specu-
lative enterprise was called the Mercan-
tile Finance Co. Ltd. This succeeded in
losing just on £1,000,000. The liquida-
tors reported that profits from the time
Fink formed the company in 1885 were
always largely imaginary, and the huge
dividends of 40 and 50 percent were
actually paid out of capital or the
money of depositors. In order to keep
up the excitement the share market was
manipulated.
On September 21, 1892, B. J. Fink
met his creditors and presented his for-
lorn balance sheet showing debts of
£1,520,000, on which he paid |d. in the
£l. To this figure should be added
another £310,000 owed to the City of
Melbourne Bank, but secretly written off
by the directors of that institution. Thus
Fink’s debts really totalled at least
£1,830,000. Fink had cross financed and
cross guaranteed his multifarious enter-
prises, building an empire on the shift-
ing sands of unsecured credit. An extra-
ordinary feature of the list was the
willingness of even conservative bankers
to lend large sums to speculative land
companies on Fink’s personal guaran-
tee.
his debts by four or five
times to represent present-day
money values and it may be seen how
deeply this one man alone had eaten
into the financial structure of the com-
paratively small community.
Older residents of Melbourne remem-
ber his younger brother, Theodore,
as an energetic Pickwickian figure,
wearing one of his extraordinary hats
and a perpetually pleasant but enig-
matic smile. Theodore Fink was one*
of the most powerful men in Mel-
bourne, a close associate of the Col-
lins House group, a director and con-
troller of the “Herald” newspaper or-
ganisation for nearly half a century,
and a philosopher who had a discon-
certing habit of disappearing for days
at a time on long country rambles
where only the sun and the stars shared
his lonely secrets. With so many boom-
ing land companies among the clients
of his legal firm, Fink apparently could
not resist the prevailing mania, and was
soon speculating heavily on his owii
account. By 1891 he had involved him-
self in debts exceeding £70,000
although like everyone else he thought
he was amply covered by the value
of the property he was buying.
Fink realised that if his land and
share holdings continued to lose their
market value, and his creditors started
pressing him for payment, the inevit-
able end was the Insolvency Court and
ruin of his legal reputation. Was there
any lawful solution? Early in 1892,
when the need was greatest, Fink came
across a little-used provision of the
insolvency law called “Composition by
Arrangement.” The original purpose
of this statute was to enable certain
debtors whose livelihood would be
jeopardised by adverse publicity to meet
their creditors privately and arrange to
pay them so much in the £l, thus
avoiding the odium of public bank-
ruptcy proceedings.
The scandal of these “secret com-
positions,” or “compotes” as they
were often called, festered inside the
body politic. Few people knew for
certain who was solvent and who was
not. Bank managers and moneylenders

kept their own lists of these secret in-
solvencies, to guard against granting
further credit. Public confidence and
credit was severely shaken by the mys-
terious bankruptcies and took years to
recover.
Not long after his first composition
with creditors in January, 1892, of 3/-
in the £l, Fink called a second credi-
tors’ meeting on July 19 at which he
paid 6d. in the £l, thus giving him
the distinction of being the only debtor
in Victoria who ever compounded with
his creditors twice in the one year.
Theodore Fink did not include his
interest in his “Herald” shares (3 shares
of £lOOO paid to £4OO, equalling 10
percent of the capital) as an asset in
either of his secret compositions. Had
it not been for the existence of the •
process of secret insolvency, both Fink
and W. L. Baillieu would have lost
their “Herald” shares with incalculable
consequences for the future.

and Minister for Railways in the
O’Loghlen Government, fought his way
back to become Premier of Victoria —
and not the worst one, by any means.
Tommy Bent, Brighton, and the land
boom grew together. He bought up
great areas of market gardens for sub-
division, so that for some time Bent
was the largest landowner in Brighton.
A constant stream of loan money
arranged by Bent was put into street
construction and lighting. His improve-
ment of the railway service, and its ex-
tension to Sandringham meant that the
value of Bent’s and all other land in
the area soared to new heights.
In 1888 Bent immortalised his name
in the annals of land speculation by
floating a company known as the
Thomas .Bent Land Co. Ltd. The pur-
pose of this company was to buy from
Bent himself some 95 acres of land at
Hingwood. Attracted by the magic
of the Bent name, many people, includ-
ing bank managers and members of
Parliament, rushed to buy the shares,
which were paid up to Bs. Bent got
the cash for his land. But the sub-
divided blocks could not be sold, and
the company collapsed ignominiously.
“Honest Tom” was not downhearted.
The following year, he saved the Gillies-
Deakin Government from collapse by
crossing the floor of the House during
an equal division on the question of
increasing the Railways Commissioners’
salaries. A few weeks later, the Gov-
ernment paid Bent £27,000 for 500
acres of land alongside the Yan Yean
Reservoir. An official Government
valuation had priced the land at £lO
ah acre, but the Government’s payment
to Bent was shown to be £54 an acre.
The old warhorse was knighted in
1908, a year before his death. His
wayward life was aptly summarised by
Paddy Reynolds, licensee of the
Cathedral Hotel, Melbourne: “Say what

MAN ON THE LAND
Plans to Save Bobby Calves
PLANS to save the 1J million bobby
calves which are slaughtered every
year soon after birth in Australia
are not new. Such plans are as old
as the dairy industry itself. Before it
became an industry, there was no prob-
lem. The calf got a suck, after the
owner took enough for himself and his
family’s immediate wants. Enough
would be left so that the calf could
grow.
This system is still used today on
plenty of Australian sheep and beef-
cattle properties where a few milkers
are kept to provide a supply of fresh
milk. But when man moved, in ever-
increasing numbers, into cities, and
health regulations demanded pasteur-
ised and bottled milk, the old system
had to go.
Today, from the mild furore created
over the disclosure that calves are
slaughtered, it seems there are people
so removed from farming reality that
they actually believe that cows are
capable of providing milk without a
pregnancy and a delivery. What has
not been said, so far, about the latest
plan to save bobby calves is that it is
linked with concern over the future
markets overseas for butter and con-
cern over the possibility of a large
wheat carryover.
The latest sale to China (55 million
bushels) is reasonably good, and har-
vest prospects are better than reason-
ably good. It could be a 400 m.-bushel
record. Having said this, it needs to be
emphasised that the latest bobby-calf
plan may very well be the best yet.
It could work.
Anyone, however, who wants to get
away from office life in the city, and
who thinks there is a fortune to be
made out of raising bobby calves “in-
efficient” dairy farmers let go to waste,
wants to keep his eyes open. One of
the dairy industry’s real problems is
that it has a surplus of critics who
know little about it. Calves have been
slaughtered in the past, and still are,
because economically it is often the
most efficient process.
The new, and very important, factor
which could provide a way out is the
scientific development of stockfeeds
which might enable surplus wheat and
surplus dairy-factory products to be
turned into a replacer feed for calves.
Milk replacers, again, are nothing new.
In the past, their fault was that they
encouraged scouring in calves and
much of the benefit was lost.
We do not propose to give free plugs
for any of the half dozen or so calf
replacers currently available on the
market nor to go into details of their
manufacture. Suffice to say that most
seem pretty good and we have heard
few complaints from farmers on the
score of quality. The old bugbear, price,
still remains.
You can, in practice as well as in.
theory, rear a better calf on arti-
ficially made replacer than on its own
mother. But usually you will sell the
same calf at a loss. In practice, as well
as in theory, you can have a calf, so
reared, ready to go out to grass at 12
weeks. Climatic conditions in a parti-
cular district, quality of grass, and so
on all enter into it, so usually it takes,
a little longer than 12 weeks.
'YY'HAT they can do in New Zealand,
or in Britain, is interesting, yet
does not mean the same thing can be
done here. The difference between
Gippsland, Western Australia, and
Queensland, for example, can be enor-
mous. Stockfeeds have, however, im-
proved vastly in the past couple of
years. Even five years ago stockfeeds
were just about anything that stock
would eat. Today, stockfeeds have a
precise meaning. They are concentrated
feeds which come in either bulk or bags
and in the form of pellets, mash, or
cake. Stockfeeds can be made for
specific use. The ingredients are
accurately measured and selected to
meet the needs of poultry, sheep, adult
cattle, calves, horses, and pigs. Most
stock take to them readily.
For calves removed from their
mothers within 24 hours of birth (the
usual dairy-farm practice) liquid is
necessary. Wheat protein is a valuable
stockfeeds base. Additives might in-
clude salt, other minerals, and vita-
mins. With the addition of some sur-
plus milk product from the dairy fac-
tories, a milk replacer can be made.
In the United States there are milk
replacers which use no natural milk at
all. There •are fully automated farms
where the feed is piped out to the
calves. Both in Britain and the United
States calves are carried on from 12
weeks to yearling stage without ever
going out of the sheds. Neither of
these countries, however, can really be

related to Australia, where, possibly,
we have too much grassland for our
own good.
While we continue to have large ex-
panses of grassland, the intensive rais-
ing system for cattle will remain a
risky proposition The
meat we get from grass-reared stock
is too good to warrant a premium for
feedlot-reared beef, as in the U.S. and
Britain.
As a meat exporter our role is that
of a producer of lean, cheaper meat.
This does not mean that things will
not change. World demand for meat is
strong. It can only get stronger. Wheat-
grower organisations, dairy-farmer or-
ganisation, and the stockfeeds industry
(now positively an industry in Aus-
tralia) are all keen on utilising bobby
calves. Anything that can convert sur-
plus wheat and surplus milk into meat,
which the world does want, is a good
move?
It would be a shame, though, if
amateurs rushed in and got their
fingers burned. Even with the vast im-
provement in stockfeeds, the prospec-
tive raiser of bobbies would appear to
need a guaranteed market, and price,
if the venture is to be worth while.
Otherwise he will be providing possibly
beautiful stock for which no one will
pay the right price.
A SYSTEM of deferred contract pay-
ments may be worth investigating
at least. It works with other forms of
farm products; why not meat? If meat
companies want the stock at, say, 14
months, they could perhaps encourage
farmers to feed to a plan by advance
payments. Unless some form of guar-
anteed profitability is worked out, it
would seem that the raising of bobbies
might well be left to meat or dairy
companies themselves, or subsidiaries.
The recent submission by the dairy
industry on the stabilisation plan did
not mention bobby-calf rearing. This
document, which to our mind was a
thoroughly commendable and re-
strained plea on behalf of dairying, did
mention long-term loans to dairy fac-
tories to permit ratonalisation, modern-
isation, and conversion to non-fat milk
solids production. If dairy factories set
up bobby-calf-rearing units themselves,
it would appear to be quite within the
spirit of the submission.
There are, in spite of all the prob-
lems, some farmers doing very well out
of bobbies in Australia. They have
been doing it for a long time and by a
system which cannot be learned from
books. What they do is to get one
cow to suckle two or three calves.
Some, by clever herdsmanship, have
got as many as 12 calves reared on one
cow in a season (not all at once).
This involves a real understanding of
cows and a good deal of intimate asso-
ciation with them which, in view of
the dismay expressed in some quarters
over the knocking of bobbies on the
head, we had best not go into in de-
tail.

NAME ADDRESS
AGRISEARCH
New Ways in Tillage
THOUGH tillage gobbles up more
horsepower and cash than most
activities in agriculture, the whole
subject seems to have been woefully
neglected by Australian agricultural
scientists. While “minimum tillage” and
“chemical cultivation” are household
terms in many rural communities over-
seas, they are still almost unspoken here.
Indeed, the breath of them in agricul-
tural circles is often felt like a chill
wind. However, the wind has begun
to change lately.
Such time-honored practices as fal-
lowing, repetitious cultivation, and the
preparation of deep seedbeds are be-
ginning to be questioned. To comple-
ment this new interest among the
agrostologists, the engineers have be-
gun to look harder at digging machines,
the effects they have on soil structure
and the power they consume in being
dragged through the soil. They hope
to be able to design, eventually, tillage
implements that will cost less to tug
along, but which will treat the soil
more kindily while leaving it in a state
that seedlings really appreciate.
Unfortunately, not much is known
about what sort of soil conditions plants
prefer to grow in. The engineers must
be feeling rather exasperated with the
agrostologists. They might reasonably
have expected them to have studied
long ago such a fundamentally im-
portant relationship as plant growth
and soil structure.
That grand old father of soil science,
the German Pfeffer, did in fact address
himself to this question and investi-
gated it with determination and some
success before the turn of the century.
The next generation of soil scientists
would have caused him much dis-
appointment, as they quickly shied
away from a problem which they soon
realised was extremely complicated. But
the third generation seems to include
people of sterner stuff.
One of them, who, curiously enough,
happens to bear the German-sounding
name of Walter Arndt, has developed
some interesting new ideas about seed-
beds. His concept, which he describes
generally as “soil surface management,”
arose from extraordinary experiments
which he conducted in the improbable
locality of Katherine, N.T. He is now
continuing his studies on soil surface
management at the CSIRO Division
of Soils, Brisbane. A fascinating
account of his experiments appears in
the September issue of “Rural Re-
search in CSIRO.” Also mentioned are
similar investigations carried out by
others at the Waite Agricultural Re-
search Institute, Adelaide.
£jPACE does not permit these experi-
ments to be described here, except
to say that they were ingeniously de-
signed to measure the resistance en-
countered by seedlings in thrusting their
roots and shoots through soil of different
texture which had resulted from dif-
ferent types of tillage and simulated,
subsequent climatic conditions. The
work was done first on models in the
laboratory and then outdoors in the
field. Good agreement between the two
sets of results was obtained, though
the work needs to be repeated on a
greater range of soil types than were
available to Mr. Arndt at Katherine.
His labors and those of his col-
leagues at the Waite pointed up the
intrinsically contrary requirements of
shoots and roots while pushing their
way through soil. They found that a
seedbed constructed to favor root
growth will hamper the emergence of
the seedling’s shoot, and vice versa.
Thus, a deep, loose seedbed, while
suiting the roots, will reduce the chances
of shoots reaching the light. On the
other hand, a firm seedbed will slow up

could lead - to such an acute lack of
moisture, or even nutrients, that the
young plant would wither away. Mr.
Arndt suggests that the best hope of
escaping from the horns of this dilemma
would seem to lie in the direction of
shallow sowing.
If this view gains credence we may
see rather radical changes in the de-

build much lighter machinery. In due

Beating Brown Rot
PEOPLE with peaches will be
pleased to hear that they may
soon be able to save their fruit
from brown rot. All they will need to
do is wrap each peach in a ten-inch
square of tissue paper which has been
impregnated with an anti-fungal chem-
ical. Brown rot, one of the most in-
tractable destroyers of soft fruits, has
defied generations of scientists to find
a simple, foolproof defence. Even the
Americans admitted only recently that
they were quite unable to prevent large
losses occurring in the national.crop be-
tween the fruit-pickers’ bags and the
housewives’ shopping baskets.
Modern professional orchardists, of
course, have managed to suppress losses
to a considerable extent through the
diligent application of a chain of pre-
cautionary measures beginning a full
year before harvest. However, the back-
yard grower is rarely prepared to be
as painstaking.

deliberately infected ripe peaches by
spraying them with spores of the brown
rot fungus. After drying, they wrapped
them in the tissue paper soaked in a
phenylphenyl acetate or butyrate. Six
days later, though the fruit was simply
stored at room temperature, rot had
made little or no headway.
The only catch is that the concen-
tration of chemical in the tissues must
be carefully adjusted to fall between
close critical limits. If it is too high it
injures the fruit, if it is too low it fails
to prevent the fungus from growing.

Position of
REGISTRAR
The Interim Council of the Victoria In-
stitute of Colleges is now inviting appli-
cations for the position of Registrar at
a salary of $10,400 per annum.
The Victoria Institute of Colleges was
recently established under legislation by
the Government of the State of Victoria.
The Institute itself will not be a teach-
ing institution but, in accordance with
the State legislation, may admit to mem-
bership as an affiliated college any insti-
tution offering tertiary education, other
than the Universities of Victoria. The
objects of the Institute are to foster
the development and improvement in its
affiliated colleges of tertiary education
in technical, commercial and other fields
of learning, including the liberal arts and
humanities.
The Institute is empowered to award
degrees, diplomas and other awards to
students of affiliated colleges who have
attained the required standards in courses
approved by the Institute. Any degree
awarded will only be for courses of study
comparable in standard to that required
for the award of a degree in a Univer-
sity.
The Registrar shall be Secretary to the
Board of Studies of the Institute and to
such other committees as the Council of
the Institute may determine. He shall
act for the Vice-President'in his absence.
Subject to the general superintendence
of the Vice-President he shall attend to
academic matters of the Institute, in-
cluding courses of study, examinations,
admissions to degrees and other awards;
edit the publications of the V.1.C.; be
responsible for all academic records; and
carry out such other duties as Council
may direct.
The organization of the V.I.C. is in its
formative stages and the Registrar will
play an important part in its design and
development.
Other conditions of employment will be
the subject of discussion with the suc-
cessful applicant, but further information
may be obtained from the Secretary of
the Institute, telephone 32-1621, Mel-
bourne.

a recent photograph and should give full
name, date of birth, marital state, quali-
fications, experience, publications, previ-
ous appointments and present position,

Melbourne, Victoria.
SPECULATORS DIARY
An Exercise in Comprehension
And the director as investment adviser
EXTRACTS from chairmen’s addresses sometimes display unusual characteristics.
Take this one: “I hold firmly to the opinion better times may shortly come to
the Sugar Industry, which is not only vital to the economy of this State, but
whose structure is of essential consequence to the general defence position of Aus-
tralia in providing as it does a bulwark of physical anid financial protection in the
populating and consolidating of our north-eastern areas against external aggression,
and which, if for no other reason, should be sustained in vigor as an assurance to this
end, and not allowed to languish.”
Analysts are always trying to find
hidden facts in the published accounts
of a company. Trying to comprehend
a written message such as this is a
new challenge. The sentence of 88
words was not exceptional in the ad-
dress. The next sentence contained 65
words, and the following sentence fell
just short of the 100 mark with a
score of 94 words!
Several weeks ago, Mr. Blake Pelly,
the chairman of Mary Kathleen
Uranium, used shorter and more direct
sentences to express his amaze;ment
about the run-up in share price of
MKU. After a fairly sharp reaction
from $3.40 to $2.50, the shares have
now rebounded to $3.60. Where does
Mr. Pelly go from here?
As was observed in the Neon Signs
catastrophe, a sharebroker who is also
a director is placed in an invidious
position when giving advice to his
clients about that company. Con-
versely, a director who unwittingly sets
himself up as an investment adviser of
his company leaves himself wide open
to criticism.
A s a holder of MKU shares, I must
admit my relief that Mr. Pelly’s
views did not prevail too strongly on the
market. By selling 100 shares at $3.50
and 100 shares at $3.60, a profit of
$Bl was earned.
Of much smaller size was the $l9
profit on the AMI shares. The divi-
dend of $5O on those shares more than
offset the slight fall in market price.
Loaded with funds, I plunged into
yet another mining share. By paying
$2.83 for 400 Mt. Morgan shares, I’m
coming in very near to the top of the
market. Still, I was anxious to get in
before the annual meeting, A year ago,
Mt. Morgan was in a fairly desperate
position. Those who think that it’s
only the farmer who prays for rain
are wrong. Production was being cur-
tailed by a serious water shortage, and
as a result the company was running
at a loss.
The heavens opened out in Decem-
ber and the water problem was over.
By February, directors were anticipa-
ting that profits for the full 1965-66
year would be comparable with the
profit of $1,025,000 earned in the ’64-
’65 year.
In fact, the profit for the full year
was $1,482,000. To some extent it
may have been the higher grade of
both copper and gold. More likely
it was the increase in the price of
copper in April, when it was decided
to base the selling price of copper on
the three-month LME price.
The current year has got away to a
strong start, with production of both
gold and copper running at a high level.
If profits can be maintained at the
same level as the final six months of
last year, earnings per share this year
should be at least 70 cents. Throw in
the speculative element surrounding
both copper and gold and it all adds
up to an interesting short-term situa-
tion.

All Mildara Brandy is made by the traditional pot-still method. This means that selected white wine is
heated in a copper pot-still, and the vapours are condensed. This liquor (called “brandy feints”) is
distilled a second time and only the “heart of the run” is considered good enough for Mildara Brandy
other fractions are discarded. The new brandy matures in casks of imported oak for several years to give a
smooth finish and delightful flavour. MILDARA SPECIAL THREE STAR BRANDY is a light style brandy,
excellent in a long drink with water, soda or dry ginger ale—especially with a tinkle of ice. MILDARA SUPREME
BRANDY. Each year the new brandy destined to become Supreme is selected for its richer flavour, then
matured for up to ten years in oak casks, in the cellars beside the Murray, to develop its inimitable style.
MILDARA EXTRA POT-STILL BRANDY is the pride of Mildara’s skilled distillers and blenders, who select the
best original brandies which have won prizes over the years, and mature them for many more years to develop
the magnificent style and bouquet presented in the distinctive label for Pot-Still Brandy. MILDARA TOPAZ
BRANDY is the lightest style of quality Australian brandy with no sugar, and of special interest to those on
a sugar-free diet —a wonderful mixer. mb.st.fpc
