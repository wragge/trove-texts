DR. KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OP THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY EAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARB UNAWARE OF HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING, HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS :
IF THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OF THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OF ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OF DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE'POWER TOCURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OF AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OF OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL •
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM.
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
THE BOOK WILL ALSO

THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
r^NTFRAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
BB KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE FROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS?AGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.

The Co-Operative
SYSTEM, the nearest approach to Socialism that can be achieved under the
present conditions of life, has met with phenomenal success wherever it has
been applied to any object. In England, even the Co-operative Societies
benefit some millions of persons —their membership exceeding a million and
a-half, and hold invested capital to the amount of eleven millions of money.
This success is owing to the fact that the investor sees not only a fair com-
mercial return on his investment, but a proprietary division of profits, which
he would not receive from any other organisation. It has been left to Aus-
tralia to apply this communistic principle to

A Grave for Two.
The Queensland Coalition Government, like
the other and still more famous Coalition of
Victoria, has fallen upon evil days. So far
it has suffered no material loss, for its
majority is still intact, and its hold upon the
salaries is as firm as it ever was ; but its
political morals, if it ever had any, have been
woefully depreciated, and it has dug a deep
sepulchre for two reputations, both of which
were good in their day, though of them both
hardly a vestige remains. It is one of the
worst features of Coalitions in general, that
they usually furnish a fathomless grave for
the public character of everybody concerned.
The one enduring principle of Party Govern-
ment is the principle of contradiction, and
its one unfailing axiom is that the other side
is a liar of the worst order, and that no act
which it ever committed or contemplated
could, by any possibility, be other than
nefarious. Therefore, it naturally follows
that the leaders on each side are, by their
own and each other’s showing, the boss liars
of the House, and the individuals mainly
responsible for the evil practices of their
respective factions ; and when these two
leaders coalesce they thereby both go back on
their life-long assertion that the other man is
a person with whom no gentleman can asso-
ciate without being infected by the foulness
of his degraded intellect. Consequently the
nation, which formerly believed in at least
one of them, is convinced that neither is
of any account; and when they peacefully
swap the principles for which each had once
professed his willingness to perish, the only
reasonable assumption is that neither ever
possessed any principles that were sufficiently
fixed to be worth mentioning. And if, instead
of effecting a compromise in the usual manner,
the one patriot accepts the whole of his
antagonist’s creed and gives up his own, the
result is just the same : the first patriot, by
swallowing the programme which he had
always previously denounced, thereby writes
himself up as a fraud and a public delusion ;
and the second is also a delusion, else he
would lift up his voice in protest when the
principles which he has always endeavoured
to keep clean are swallowed by the person
whose foulness and loathsomeness had filled
him with so much abhorrence. The priest
who sees a dog consuming the sacred
elements, and yet makes no protest, is a
priest of too b*“ an order to command
respect.
* * *
In the old and comparatively honest days
of Queensland politics, when Griffith was
Avont to denounce M‘Tlavkaith as a thief
avlio had looted the Treasury and carried off
the proceeds, and Avhen MTlwraith was
accustomed to treat Griffith with pitying
scorn as one part fool and one part raving
impostor, the two political chiefs Avcre
apparently enemies to the death. Their
foud was more bitter than even the average
run of such feuds, and apparently the one
desire of each was to expectorate upon the
other s grave, and insult Ids dishonoured
remains. Yet life goes smoothly enough
with them in their new capacity as friends
and allies, though Griffith has never yet,
so.far as we are permitted to know, with-
drawn his assertion that M ll wraith should
be prosecuted for his dealings with the
public funds, and MTlwraith has said
nothing to explain away the position ho
formerly took up —that Griffith’s inherent
baseness and unreliability made his accusa-
tions not worth refuting. Of the two, how-
ever, Griffith has made by far the
smaller sacrifices. Ho has consented to
associate with the individual whom he
'formerly professed to regard as <r political
leper, and thus he tacitly gives the lie to his
old assertionsconcerninghis opponent’s moral
uncleanness, or else writes himself down as a
person to whom lepers are congenial society;
but otherwise he has lost nothing. His old
policy of Imperial grovel is still in the ascen-
dant. He is still the same alleged Liberal and
muddled Socialist who was wont to yearn
oyer the cause .of the poor, and whose yearn-
ings never did any good to any single human
being save himself. He drops the same tear
over the world’s inhumanity as before, and
writes the same noble sentiments as he used
to do, and treads on everybody—also-as he
used to do—who wants him to sacrifice some-
thing more than sentiment in the interests
of the democracy. In every sense ho is the
leading spirit of the Government—a Govern-
ment of militarism, loyal diivel, and ancient
Toryism, strangely disguised by alleged
longingsafter universal equality~an anomaly
as unaccountable as a republican monarch,
or a Christian hangman, or a gaol-flogger
who runs a society for the spread of humanity
in the intervals of his professional duties,

And MTlwraith, the strong-willed Re-
publican of old, now acts as the humble
follower and subordinate of his former
opponent, and blunders along with him to
one common grave. To do this he aban-
doned his claims upon the Premiership of
Queensland, and threw away the great politi-
cal following which he had himself organised
and led to victory. The situation was unique;
for a i arty to abandon its leader is by no
means uncommon, but for a successful leader
to abandon his party, his principles, and the
highest situation in the State in one act is an
astonishing conjunction of circumstances,
MTlwraith formed the National organisa-
tion, and then within a few short months cast
it overboard ; he drew up the National pro-
gramme and straightway jumped on it with
both feet. He ejected a Governor, and suc-
cessfully defied the authority of the Crown,
and then wrecked his own cause by joining
the party of Joyalism ; he was the most con-
spicuous Republican of Australia, and when
lie might have been the first President of the
free Australian Commonwealth ho threw
the chance away to be a secondary apostate
in a bitter enemy’s broken-down Cabinet. A
few years ago he was the one great leader in
all this continent who refused to have part
or lot in the infamous Naval Tribute policy,
and who fearlessly exposed that scheme as a
device which would place the country at the
mercy of its own fle^; a few months ago, in
his new capacity as*,*a very small politician,
he swallowed his own utterances, and ac-
cepted the scheme which he had so elo-
quently denounced. Sir Thomas MTlwraith
did not sell himself in the ordinary sense of
the term ; he rather paid for the privilege of
giving himself away. Other men have aban-
doned their principles for a consideration in
money or position; the Nationalist chief
abandoned his victorious following and his
position in one act for no visible considera-
tion at all. Possibly he did it simply because
he didn’t know what to do with the follow-
ing, and felt that he must get rid of it at any
sacrifice. He may simply have started
business as a patriot from motives of expe-
diency, and found that the trade of being
even a successful patriot was too extensive
an undertaking for his own moral capacity,
and that his soul was not large enough for
the position.

At all events, there is no shred or vestige
of national principle in the pblicy of the
dreary Coalition It is openly and undis-
guisedly a Government with a narrow and
grovelling policy—a Goyernment .of shifts
and expedients and mean devices, compared
to which even the dull and miserably
commonplace Coalition of Duncan Gillies
seemed almost pure and high-minded.
Queensland, under the Griffith-MTl-
wraith regime, is the one state in all
Australasia whieh travels on cheap-labour
principles, and taxes its impoverished popu-
lation to pay for the importation of foreign
paupers and the illiterate off-scourings of
Southern Europe and Asia. In a time of
universal distress and poverty, it exists
principally for the purpose of flooding the
land with Italian slaves and low-priced
niggers, so that the planter and the mono-
polist may be supplied with labour at
Chinese rates ; and meanwhile the white
toiler must cither starve, or else learn to
live like his imported competitor, on rice
and maccaroni, and become a more econo-
mical beast of burden than oven the sweated
operative of Eastern London. There is a
petrified, soul-blasting disregard of every
principle of humanity about this scheme
which should be sufficient, in itself, to sink
the Coalition into the lowest depth of the
great sea of oblivion. For not only is the
Queenslander ruined by the competition
thus forced upon him, but ho is taxed, in
the midst of his distresses, to pay for
bringing out the cheap competitor who
helps so materially to bring about his ruin ;
and at the same time the foundations are
laid for a new racial difficulty which may
require centuries for its ultimate solution.
And the twin authors of this scheme are the
alleged Liberal who built his reputation
on the abolition of Kanaka labour, and the
a loged patriot who rose to sudden fame on
the cry that Austra'ia should be for tire new
Australian nation, and for no other race or
people under the sun !
* * #
Moreover, Sir Samuel Griffith, who
sympathised so tearfully, in theory, with the
cause of the poor, has emptied the’"Queens-
land Treasury to express that same sympathy
with guns and military demonstrations ; and
now the same Griffith, in his capacity as
an opponent of the nefarious system of
private property in land, proposes to fill the
gap by trading off the public estate at 10s.
an acre to syndicates and land-grabbers and
other monopolists of all sorts and descrip-
tions. And MHI wraith, once about the
ablest financier in Australia, and now a mere
broken-down cash driveller, concurs help-
lessly in this scheme. Beyond this, the
Coalition has only two features in its policy;
to whoop for the interests of Imperialism
and to perpetrate some dark and elaborate
dodge with the electoral system which will
effectually cripple the rising Labour-party at
the ensuing election. It is a strange and
purposeless combination with a past that only
wants to be buried, and a future that is not
worth hoping for. Its leaders are a pair of
shrieking reactionaries ; its one ambition is
the conservation of the sacred interests of
Property ; and its diet is its own eaten and
digested principles ; and yet withal it pre-
serves, from sheer force of habit, some sem-
blance of a yearning after democracy which
may stand it in good stead when it cadges
for the democratic vote at the next dissolu-
tion. It has never done anything for the
democracy, but it has always looked as if it
was going to do something, and this weird,
unfinished appearance may yet do some
service to Samuel Griffith. As for his
colleague, the Coalition is his political grave,
and he and the Coalition will probablV end
together.

The Bulletin, at one time, was a pro-
found believer in Sir Thomas MHlwraith,
as being the best hope of the National Party
in Australia. It believed in him, not neccs-
Stirily from any absolute faith in his sincerity,
for sincerity is an unknown quantity, and
the man who takes even his own 1 0 U, or
discounts his own promissory-note, may be
surprised to find that he himself is of very
little account when he calls on himself and
tries to collect the money. But it believed
in him because he had staked his reputation,
his party,' and his political prospects on the
issue—because he had so much to gain by
adhering to his principles, and so much to
lose by abandoning them. The Bulletin
would trust even Duncan Gillies or Henry
Parkes— probably the two shiftiest of Aus-
tralian politicians—to be absolutely honest,
when there were large profits in honesty, and
dishonesty was a dead loss. But, as the event
showed, it made a mistake in trusting M‘ll-
wraith. His case was absolutely unique ; he
had everything to gain by being sincere, and
he apostatised in a falling market. He was a
man capable of being great, he spent half
his life in rising to be a great man, and then
he apparently grew tired of the situation
and became a very small one as a matter of
preference. He was a man of iron, and he
voluntarily degenerated into a man of fat.
To all outward appearance he bolted to avoid
success, and the contingency was one which
noonecbyld reasonably have anticipated.
The individual who goes back on his prin-
ciples for the sake of gain is sufficiently
familiar ; the individual who does the same
thing as a losing speculation is as rare as
hen’s teeth, and even more unaccountable.
About Gambling.
Making all allowance for the improved
luxuriance of denunciation that the topic of
gambling naturally evokes amongst the noisier
and more intemperate class of pietists, there
still remains a big residuum of ugly fact in con-
nection with the betting industry. It is a
saddening sight to watch the slender earnings
of the shop-boy and the domestic servant
engulfed week by week in the bottomless
pit of totalisators, wild-cat mining companies,
and other complex modifications, heathen and
Christian, of the unsophisticated pitch-penny
or fan-tan. It is deplorable to think of the
number of carefully-brought-up youths who
are led on by the seductive wiles of the
tempter into petty and punishable forms of
dishonesty, and so go to ruin at the
very outset of their career, instead of
growing up to a respected old age, and
rooking the public in a legitimate and
praiseworthy fashion by promoting finance
companies, and taking fixed deposits for three
years at 12 per cent. There is no escaping the
conviction that the modern prevalence of
gambling in its many forms is demoralising. It
discourages and unsettles industry. It is the
source of an inconceivable amount of crime and
suffering. People everywhere arc taught to
despise the old-fashioned process of amassing
a competence by a lifetime of honest, hard work
and thrift, and selfishness and foresight, and to
put all their trust in I lie chance of a lucky
transaction in land or shares, or of drawing the
winner in a big consultation. The industrious
clerk or artisan is apt to become very dissatisfied
with his weekly wage when he sees people
around him win by the turn of a card in a da\
more than 119 could hope to earn by the labour
of years. Perhaps he risks his own hard-won
savings on the chance that fortune may favour
him next time, and so embarks on the perilous
voyage that in all but about one case out of ten
thousand ends in shipwreck.
„ * # , #
Now, our moralist is quite right in declaring
that even from a business standpoint it is mad-
ness to exchange a certainty for that chance. T 0
say nothing about the moral wide of the question
when honesty, industry, and thrift can secure
to a man a competence for life and the certainty
of a restful old age, then do barter away such
realities for a mcry shadowy possibility of be-
coming wealthy at one stroke is the act of
a fool. But, unfortunately for this argument
there is a defect in the statement of the case’
To speak of the choice as being between a cer-
tainty on the one hand and a chance on the
other is a demonstrable fallacy. Honesty, in-
dustry, and thrift—nay, even selfishness— arenot
in themselves sufficient to ensure success in life.
A man possessing all these qualifications in a
high degree may starve, while around.him the
dishonest, the idle, and the improvident are
rising rapidly to wealth and honour. The
average wage-earner, however deserving he
may be, has no very, bright prospect to cheer
him on. The opportunities of lifting himself
out of the ranks of wage-earners into a position
of case and possible leisure arc of rare occur-
rence. As civilisation advances they become
rarer—and the interest legitimately obtainable
upon savings is all the while growing less. His
chances depend upon Ids power of becoming
possessed by some means of a lump
sum of money. With that he may set
himself up in business, he may find
remunerative investments, he may, if the
amount is large enough, bank it, and retire on
the interest. The possibility of acquiring such
a sum of money is the one thing that can
remove the want, or the fear of want, that
hangs like a shadow over his life. Accordingly
some such idea, as a rule, becomes the object of
his life. If he looks round to see by what
means others have succeeded, he soon discovers
that the slow plodding way is by no mean# the
surest way. It is one way, but not an infallible
way. To judge by averages, his chance is not
even a strong one. 80 far as the attainment of
this given object is concerned, he may put down
the odds at about ten-thousand to one that his
life is going to be a failure. The big fortunes
he sees accumulated around him are mostly, in
some way or other, the outcome of successful
gambling—or of unlovely usury, or both.
* # #
To gamble, then, is not necessarily to stake a
modest certainty against a remote chance. It
is chance against chance. We are now taking
the business view (business views rule the
churches and the world, and probably the next
world) of the matter, and disregarding
for a moment the moral side. The well-
to-do men, as a rule, have not become
so by force of lifelong practice of the
steady virtues. They have made their piles
by lucky speculations, by unearned incre-
ments, by the prompt seizure of casual
opportunities, by mercilessly using the power
which circumstance has given them of appro-
priating the produce of other men’s labour,
the work of other men’s brains. Even if they
have stood sternly aloof from sweeps on the
Melbourne Cup, their accumulations "represent
many ventures which were none the less
gambling, though they were not decided 011 the
race-track. These undertakings are beyond the
reach of the poorly-paid wage-slave. The
means of gambling ready to his hand are the
totalisator and the sweep. That he will lose is
only one remove from a dead certainty. Still
there is a chance for him—a poor and remote
chance, but the one chance he has of making
his life something more than a ceaseless, weary
grind. So he risks his coin, and if he loses,
and loses, and loses again, he feels somehow
that he did have a chance. We are not apolo-
gising for the spread of gambling ; we are not
justifying it; we are merely accounting for it.
Gambling is demoralising and debasing. But
so, on the other hand, is extreme poverty ; so is
hopeless, lifelong toil. If the moral reformer
can succeed in abolishing these last, he will not
need any special legislation directed against the
bookmaker or the tote, except such legislation
as is necessary to make these two machines
gamble honestly.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Upheaval of the “ Pauper.”
The New South Wales Assembly has decided
that the cornstalk pauper shall have a vote on
the same basis as any other citizen. It came to
this conclusion with considerable difficulty.
There was the usual hoot of derision from the
Conservative side of the House, and many pre-
sumably humorous members drew fancy pictures
of the pauper constituency of the future —a
constituency old, bald, hard of hearing, partially
paralysed, and with only two sound teeth in
its possession, which would put up a represen-
tative pauper as its member—probably the
oldest, baldest, and most grumpy and paralytic
patriarch in the crowd. There was the old,
old gag about that alleged rule of an alleged
constitution, whereby every individual who
pays taxes is entitled, to a share in the control
of the State, and the individual who doesn’t
pay taxes stands out, and there were various
other inefficient jokes, more or less flat and
ancient. But the old wheezes all fell through.
The Foreign-trade party, in particular, did not
sail in with anything like its usual vigour; it is
run by a pauper who has gone bung for an aggre-
gate of £IOO,OOO or so, and who would himself
be in a benevolent asylum but for public charity
and his neglect to pay 20s. in the £, and conse-
quently it hardly cared to sit too heavily on the
men many of whom have drifted into the work-
house through paying their debts. Moreover the
members who have friends or relatives enjoying
Covernment pensions, or who hope to enjoy pen-
sions of their own at some future date, felt their
position was weak and said little, for the man
with a pension lives in a benevolent asylum of


tjg own, and an exceedingly expensive one
at that; and his right to vote is just the
name as the right of the cheaper pauper who
lives in a public institution. He isn’t bald
r toothless because his share of the national
alms is sufficient to keep him in hair and false
teeth, but beyond that there is no differ-
ence whatever. The barrister with no
particular practice, who is boosted on to
|l ie bench, and gets disabled in a few
mouths, afld is pensioned off, is a fair
sample of the lofty kind of mendicant who
enjoy ß a vote and lives on charity at the same
time", and whose position is never even ques-
tioned. The semi-paralytic in the asylum is
a convenient subject for sensational humour,
but he is no more comic than the semi-paralytic
who is a life-long bore in the Upper House, or
the paralysed capitalist who has thirteen
separate votes, and uses them all in his loco-
motive chair, to help on the Foreign-trade
interest. And in any case the old gibe about
charity is played out. There is no charity
about a benevolent asylum, and every old and
indigent citizen has a right to go there if he
pleases just as he has a right to go to gaol if he
wants to. He paid for the asylum in his better
days; the institution is supported, in a great
measure, by taxation, and every tax-payer has
a vested interest in it, and has a right, under
certain circumstances, to realise on his in-
vestment. His provision for old age is
certainly less dignified than that of the
man who has laid up his money in an
insurance - office, and bought a portentous
annuity, but it is a provision none the less, and
the one man is no more a pauper than the other.
Moreover, the State owes a debt of gratitude to
many of these ancient individuals for another
reason, for many of them have reared sons who
are now in affluent circumstances, and who
have shunted their parents when they had no
further use for them, and employ themselves
in propping up the interests of Capital, and
in writing letters to the daily press about the
danger of giving the old man a vote. And, in
addition to all these considerations, the lie
about taxation and representation going to-
gether is altogether exploded, for the State
taxes women wherever it gets a chance, and
doesn’t give them a vote ; also, it taxes China-
men and lunatics and convicts —none of whom
have votes —when they have any property that
can be got at, and in various other ways the
alleged axiom of the Constitution is knocked
out in one round. Therefore, the principle of
extending the suffrage to ‘ ‘ paupers ” is not so
absurd as it looks, and the humour that has
been wasted on it is a very wooden substance.
The kind of pauper who isn’t entitled to a vote
has got one already, and the other sort may as
well enjoy the privilege too.

Queensland’s Little Invoice.
Premier Griffith has got his Provincial
Parliaments resolutions through the Banana-
land Assembly in their preliminary declaratory
form. How they will fare when embodied in
what Sir Samuel calls ‘ ‘ a concrete form ” —in
a Bill, in fact, the latest idea anent which is
that it ought to be submitted to the country as a
test-cry at the next election—seems doubtful.
That they will ever pass absolute majorities of
both Houses seems most improbable. It they
should be navigated through these dangers, and
also get the finishing touch of the Queen’s
assent, Bananalantl won’t be able to complain
of want of government. There will be South
Queensland with two Houses of Parliament;
there will be Central Queensland, whose
leaders, as yet, favour only one House in its
Provincial Legislature; there will be North
Queensland with two Houses ; and there will
he the Queensland Grand Parliament, repre-
senting the three Provinces with two Houses.
There will be one chief Governor, three Lieu-
tenant« Governors, three sets of Parliamentary
officials, three Supreme Courts with three Chief
Justices, and (say) twelve Supreme Court
Judges, &c., &c. To set down the Parliamen-
tary and governing expenditure alone, it would
probably appear like this :

The Prophet of the Poster.
Last Saturday the great Prophet of the
Century—he of the glaring coat and the
illustrated pants—made his triumphal entry
into Sydney. He was a long, withered-looking
man with a fierce nose—a man who looked one-
half Hebrew money-lender and one-half Yankee
book-canvasser, and his eyes were a little too
close together, and his hatchet face and his
haggard jaws were worn with much friction in
running after the cash. His ears were large,
and seemed to stand up with incessant listen-
ing ; they were the ears of a man who had all
his life been harkening to the footsteps of the
interest as it mounted up on the promissory
note, or the muffled tread of the subscriptions
that were yet afar off. He had long, bony
fingers—the sort of fingers that were built to
pick the missing threepenny-piece out of the
narrow cracks and crevices of humanity ;
and a wide, business-like mouth in which
anybody would feel naturally inclined
to post a letter, and after looking at it
one naturally glanced at the General’s stomach,
expecting to find there an inscription setting
forth that he would be cleared at 10 p.m. And
around him were the thousands of the Salva-
tionists, with their faces that seemed to be cut
out of one pattern —with their monotonous
sameness of expression, one-half silliness, one-
half burning fanaticism—a howling crowd of
unreasoning devotees with the glorified book-
canvasser for their god. It was the apotheosis
of the Gospel of advertising, and the man in
the triumphal ear was the embodiment of the
new Church—the Church of the big brass
trumpet and the screaming poster and the
flaring lithograph—the creed that is one-
quarter Bible and three-quarters ballet and
performing elephant. He rose to greatness
because he was the one prophet of the age
who knew exactly how to run the tabernacle
and the shop in the same contract. If you were
in a hurry you could call in and be saved in a
quarter-of-an-hour, and large parties were
saved by contract. The new seer recognised
the fact that all the old seers had failed because,
though the world might like redemption much,
it liked a circus more, and, therefore, he
gathered in the masses by embodying the circus
and the redemption in one and the same act.
He realised that his great Predecessor was des-
pised and rejected because He didn’t “bill ’’the
Land of Galilee and paste his gigantic poster on
the barren sides of Hermon, and that He died
poor because He allowed another man to carry
the bag; consequently the General keeps his
“ advance-agent ” always going, and hangs on
to the bag himself. Of all the enormous wealth
of the Army every cent is his, and either he or
his heir can sell off everything down to the last
inharmonious cornet at any moment, and burst
up the holy menagerie, and disperse all the
men in blue pants and all the men in
red pants, and then retire on the proceeds.
He is the preacher of religious freedom, and yet
even the Pope is a microscopic despot by com-
parison ; body and soul, the Army is his and
bis alone. The prophetic end of him may
possibly have risen against the hideous wrong
and injustice of this world, but the cheap book-
fiend section of his soul has always kept him
from denouncing them, and thereby making
himself unpopular in high places. When he
took up the cause of the “ submerged tenth ” of
Fiiigland, he did not heave all the combined
strength of the Army against the great land
monopoly, by which the legion of the lost is
created and maintained. It was more comfort-
able, and more flattering to the monopolists, to
hear of a plan by which the obnoxious resi-
duum could be taken away and allowed to
fester in our far-off land, and presently their
cheques began to flow in freely, and the
burnished nose of Booth began to gleam at
aristocratic tables,and his haggard jaws obtained
a place in “good society.” The Prophet of
Galilee took the opposite course, and came to
grief because he denounced the land-grabber of
old Syria instead of dining with him and gather-*
ing in his cheque. The last Prophet of Islam
died fighting a hopeless battle in the desert for
the same reason, whereas, if he had been a man
of more discretion, he would have said nothing
about national freedom, but would have softly
passed the hat round in Alexandria and become
a species of tame cat about the back door of the
Khedive’s palace. But both these prophets
failed, and Booth has succeeded. His triumphal
progress round the globe culminated in Satur-
day’s ovation at Sydney. The programme of
his reception was an able piece of stage manage-
ment, and there was no single hitch anywhere.
Unpremeditated applause was to burst forth
spontaneously at 2.30 p.m. sharp, and it burst
accordingly. The vestals of the cause were
there in force, mounted on the haggard
cab-horse and the tired and miserable steed
out of the ash-cart. There was a gleam
of exultation in the hawk-like eye of the
prophet, and his hatchet face was illumined by
a hungry smile. And then, amid wild and
general enthusiasm, the procession started, and
the great embodiment of the art of getting to
heaven by advertisement went on his way down
the street in glory. It was his day out.
Balmaceda was just dead in far-off Santiago,
and the papers were short of someone to fill
the column that that hard-fighting Chilian
soldier used to occupy, so Booth came in handy.
Drink and Weariness.
'riii', anti-liquor contingent rose the other night
in N.S.W. Assembly, and sailed, as usual, on a
trackless sea of figures and a shoreless waste of
heaving statistics, to prove that drink is a curse
which ought to lie instantly suppressed. In the
course of the debate the leading crank solemnly
and in all good faith told a pathetic story about
a Sydney licensed victuallers’ picnic, where 600
people consumed 14,088 bottlesof grog (being 23|
bottles to each individual, infants included)
but even this steep assertion fell flat; and if
the picnic had drunk 230 jars of sulphuric acid
per head, the statement would have fallen flat
just the same. The Prohibition party is fight-
ing a hopeless battle, for the incurable weari-
ness of the whole earth is against it.
Man does not live by bread and broad-
cloth alone. The earth is tired—very, very
tired, and it drinks to bury its mental exhaus-
tion. It wants to forget itself, and forgetful-
ness is sold in black bottles and not in ginger-
beer bottles; it wants new ideas and new
inspirations, and it finds them in liquor. Some-
times it dies of the liquor, but if it didn’t it
would die far faster of monotony and desolation
and grey solemnity. The craving for change
and excitement is ineradicable, and there is no
excitement in a teetotal meeting, neither is
there any wild, picturesque burst in the plain,
brown-covered tract; and no really joyous or
self-forgetful party ever sat up late and drowned
its anxieties in passing the big, cold-water jug
and the hymn. The unobjectionable oleograph
showing the drunkard’s family dying hori-
zontally in an attic awakes no happy recollec-
tions, and the teetotal gospel is the gospel of the
dull, humourless clod who goes to bed every
night at ten, and never smiles except when he
uses by chance some old, mirthless, disused grin
that was last employedin the middle ages. There-
fore, the teetotaller, especially he who publicly
makes a virtue of his teetotalism, generally
dies young—dies of horrible sameness, and the
old dead-level of existence. Men do perish of
these unrecognised complaints—they are more
deadly than the wildest orgie. The individual
who spends his entire existence in turning a
grindstone, even under the most improved
hygienic conditions, never reaches a good old
age ; he dies of the sight of the grindstone, and
goes to turn an invisible crank made of air in
the shadowy land. The person who is strictly
moral dies of seeing his own morals always
before him ; the man who neither smokes nor
drinks nor gambles nor possesses any other vices,
peters out because his brain is used up by
hard and incessant contemplation of his own
goodness. The men who drink much in the
nineteenth century live longer than the men
who drank a great deal less in the twelfth,
because even the hereditary capitalist of that
era grew tired of loafing in a stone castle with
no knowledge, no literature, no cards to gamble
with, and no reasonable-sized city to paint red.
Therefore the stagnation entered into his soul,
and he fell into a state of premature old age.
His modern prototype may be found among the
sad and sober Marquesas islanders, who can sit
down under a tree and die by scores at the
shortest notice, merely for want of anything
outside their own dead calm of existence to live
for. The epidemic can be stopped, as in
the case of the niggers employed on
Queensland plantations, by a general “drunk.”
The teetotal crank should consider this
circumstance. If he can offer any new joy
to take the place of drink, then drink can go,
but there is no joy in the dull lecture that is
delivered by the flat-footed teacher with the
umbrella, - or in the ghastly tract, or the
cold and soulless pump, or in the lemonade-.
bottle, which is so nerveless and so ashamed
of itself that it refuses to stand up on
its own bottom. Moreover, the advanced
crank also clamours for the abolition of novels
and tobacco and theatres and gambling and
boxing and horse-racing, and of everything
which makes man’s heart beat a little faster, and
when he is finished this world will be a smile-
less land of solid literature, hymns and tea, and
people will have nothing to do but sit round in a
dreary and frog-like way, and croak, which
is a vulgar synonym for die. The case
lies between liquor and horrid weariness, and
while this is so the pump theorist may bang
down statistics through all the long-drawn
cycles of time without any results.
—♦- '
Attorney-General Simpson, of N.S.W., has
distinguished himself a little more than usual
with his Bill for the better protection of
children. Some of its provisions are good;
many of them are old-womanish, grand-
motherly and ridiculous. It proposes, among
other things, that any person, in whose house
an illegitimate child is born, shall be required
to “give notice to that effect.” Supposing the
person in question doesn’t know that the child
is illegitimate, what then ? If the said
“ person ” is not also the mother of the child,
the chances are about equal that she won’t
know anything save what the said mother tells
her, and the chances are about twenty to one
that the woman won’t tell the truth. Then, if
the occupier of the house is the mother of the
child, she is already bound to give notice at
the registrar’s office in the usual way, and
if the one law can’t be enforced who is able to
enforce the other ? The Bill also proposes that
“ notice shall be given ” of the death of any
illegitimate child under the age of five years.
There is another law already in force which
provides that notice shall be given of the death
of any child, illegitimate or otherwise, as well
as of the death of any and every other person,
and if that old law is of no avail, what use will
the new one be ? Australia is suffering from
too many Acts of Parliament already. There
are enough statutes in existence to tackle
almost every vice under the sun, and if nobody
uses them what can be gained by passing a lot
more which will be left unused also ?
The Ballance Government’s Factory Bill
arrived the other day in the Maoriland
Council, and that body of patentates pro-
ceeded to amend it after their accus-
tomed fashion. The object of the Bill in its
original form was to abolish sweating, to re-
strict child labour, and to provide more security
for factory operatives. The old and hog-like
monopolists at once waded in, and reduced the
age at which children could be employed in
factories to 13 years, thereby increasing the
pressure of cheap infant competition instead of
reducing it ; and whereas the Bill enacted that
any place where four people were employed
should be deemed a factory, and come under
the operation of the Act, they altered the
number to six. Consequently, any brutal
sweater employing less than six people is
exempt from supervision, and can boss the
miserable children under his control into an
early grave if he feels that way inclined ; and
the Council’s amendment relieves a good many
hundred small tyrants, who would otherwise
have been carefully looked after, from any
serious control. Its members personally gain
nothing by this move, for they are large, whole-
sale sweaters—not small ones ; they were merely
actuated by that love of brutality and tyranny
which grows up in the soul of nearly everybody
who is trusted with irresponsible authority.
Then the Council of irremovable despots started
to consider Sir George Grey’s Friendly
Societies Bill—a measure designed for the pur-
pose of protecting the poor man who puts his
savings in a financial institution against the
richer individual who ruins that institution—
and cast it out by 20 votes against 5, after
which it adjourned in peace. This bit of
experience shows that the Maoriland Labour-
party was right in demanding the reform of the
Upper House first; and that the New South
Wales Labour-party wastes its time haggling
over Bills which are utterly useless so long as
there is an unreformed Upper House waiting to
provide each liberal enactment with a sepulchre.
At a meeting of the shareholders of the
defunct Australian Mercantile Loan and
Guarantee Co., held at Newcastle, N.S.W., a
motion was unanimously carried censuring those
members of Parliament among whom £BO was
collected for the defence of J. P. Howe, the
member under committal on a charge of having
swindled the company. This shows how un-
civilised at heart the community really is, and
how undemocratic are the democrats who allege
that in raising money for the purpose set
forth, Howe’s Parliamentary colleagues were
“ endeavouring to defeat the ends of justice.”
The Bulletin sees nothing in the £BO sub-
scription save steps to ensure Howe being
properly defended before a jury—should he be
convicted after enjoying an adequate defence all
the greater will be his damnation. The Bul-
letin sympathises with those who have been
the victims of such cold-blooded rascality as
has apparently characterised the operations of
the company, but it execrates, in this case as in
all others, the brutal and revengeful doctrine
that “the ends of justice” mean the handing
over of an accused man naked to those who
demand his blood. In times of panic there is
no justice in the public, and when, as is often
the case, the law joins in the frenzy there is no
justice in the land at all. Such delirium is not
the exclusive property of the poorer classes, for
the great advocate, Aspinall, was hailed as a
social leper and refused admission to the leading
Sydney clubs because he had accepted a brief
to defend at the bar of justice a citizen charged
with having shot a prince, whom boots the local
public were industriously licking. When civili-
sation really rules, all accused persons will be
defended as well as prosecuted at the expense
of the State, and when a man is convicted he
will be compelled, so far as in him lies, to
defray the cost incurred by the State in prose-
cuting him.

Hon. William Davidson Greatorex Fitz-
gerald, titled drunk, who formerly rode a fiery
charger in the Lancers and lately has driven a
Sydney milk-cart, has just got 18 months for
the forgery and uttering of a £5 cheque—his
third conviction (the two former having been
for embezzlement and theft respectively). Hon.
Great Wreck Fitzgerald is a lucky poten-
tate. The ordinary rum-and-milk man who,
with such a record, comes before the Quarter
Sessions for forgery, gets five years’ hard at
least, and sometimes seven or ten years. Please
let us know of any other third-timer who has at
Quarter Sessions got off with 18 months for
forgery ? It is not long since they sent up a
poor wretched Sydney baker’s driver for 18
months (first conviction) for embezzling 13s.
And pray how long is it since a New South
Wales Quarter Sessions Judge sent up a (first
conviction) man for seven years for a £6 Bs.
forgery? And even though Mr. Greatorex
Fitzgerald has only 18 months to serve, we
shall have to watch him hard to make sure that
he doesn’t get out before Xmas.
Various correspondents, some of them well-
meaning and some otherwise, have alluded at
intervals to this paper, in more or less kindly
terms, as “ the organ of the Labour-party.” In
response, The Bulletin hereby repudiates the
situation in the most vigorous and explicit
manner. It is not the organ of the Labour-
party, or of the Protectionist-party, or of the
Freetrade-party, or of any single Freetrade,
Protectionist or Labour member, or of any
other party or individual whatsoever, outside its
own office. It declines the billet for the suffi-
cient reason that every political party known
in history or out of it has gone back on its
principles and sold its supporters sooner or
later, if it lived long enough to do it,
and the present parties, in course of time,
will probably do the same. Therefore,
in case the Freetrade party should turn
Protectionist, and the Protectionist party
should turn Freetrade, and the Labour-party
should one day become K.O.M.G.’s and howl
for Property, The Bulletin (which has never
yet from the day it started been in any
way under the control of any member of
Parliament) is the organ of none of them
—if it were it would either have to turn
its coat along with them, or else take the
trouble of contradicting its past assertions, and
the exertion might make it feel tired. It is the
organ of purely democratic and Protectionist
principles, because, though parties come and
go, the principles stay for ever ; and it has a
him belief in no politician, alive or dead. It
believes in some a shade less than others, and
that is all the difference.
When Mrs. Ann Riley purchased the land
which came to be known as the “ Riley Estate ”
(Sydney), she paid £7OOO for it. In 1835, about
ten years later, Edward Riley, her eldest son,
was incarcerated *in old Sydney gaol for debt—
“ Price Waning” has the documents in the case
in his possession and a rough valuation was then
made of the property, which fixed its worth at
£lOO,OOO. Twenty-two feet frontage of one of the
by-streets of the estate were sold the other day,
at a price which would give a present value for
the original block of a few thousands short of
three million pounds sterling.

Mt Dhar Moorabinba,—
homebody tells mo that ahy of Governor Jersey’s
As.D.Ci who attend the Cup will experience a north-
easterly time of it at the hands of a section of Melbourne
top grit. There will be sneers instead of smirks, coupled
with surprise at the size of Goschen’s boots and the flap
of Ohumley’s ears ; also, fairy feet will go'out of their way
to trample on their outlying corns, and the cordiality of
former occasions will be not wanted on this voyage. And
all because the heiress to the profits of a big Melbourne
rag-shop was the only Melbournienne invited to gambol
at N.S.W. Government House this spring, while the
hab;tuds of other days (who all dutifully reported them-
selves at Government House on their arrival here) were
not once invited over (he sacred threshold ! And when a
woman comes over 500 miles to the tune of ten trunks for
the purpose of making a sister of Lady Jersey she
naturally wants to tear anybody up by the roots if they
bar her passage.
“Led Astray,” at Sydney Criterion, was witnessed by a
full circle on Saturday, and received with shrieks of rap.
ture. But it was rather funny to hear a row of obviously
married men all “out for a run ” endorsing, with hands
and hoofs, the high-falutin which Titheradge has to talk
about the way a man should treat his wife! Mrs. Brough
as “ Armande ” (she got a double reception) was a nicely-
dressed V earning Soul, rather incomprehensible in this
day of remorseless feminine common-sense, by the way,
and the robe she looked best in was the cream woollen
teatgown, the train lined with old gold, the front draped
in cream muslin, bordered with gold, of the “bouquet
scene.” Also the eau-de-nil satin and crystal bead
trimming of the ball act was soothing. Hilda Spong—
greatly improved in style, only why does she hold her
chin in a sort of dentist's first pose of the patient ?—looked
fresh and genuinely ingenue all the time—especially in
the simple white frock of the last act; and “Dot” 1
Boucicault, as the good genius of the piece, was got up
ala the President of the N.S.W. Art Society. Inlfront,
the most interesting woman wore crushed strawberry silk
and cream Spanish lace—only she would hide herself
beyond the box curtain.
There were two garden-parties in Sydney last week, and
these cheap and boring forms of polishing off your social
creditors seem to be getting a footing amongst people
who want to save their candles and keep other people off
their carpels. But the most captivating thing about a
Sydney garden-party is that you needn’t have the wear
and tear of it upon your own gravel-you needn’t have
any gravel at nil, in fact-hut just write a little note to
the obliging curator to let your guests raid in the Botanic
with, the polite hope that he won’t object to your boiling
the afternoon billy on the lawn—and there you are. Of
course there are one or two drawbacks to all this cheap
alfresco joy. It isn’t nice to have a hungry sundowner
(not looking so pretty as George Darrell) moaning in' the
vicinity and swallowing every time you swallow—neither
would every woman care to chatter and promenade with
a fringe of pic-nicking families and nurse-girls for
audience—just as if the bon-ton were going through a
matinee performance for the benefit of the rank-and°file.
Besides which if you give your ffites in a public place in a
democratic city like Sydney where the populace bursts
througli simply from principle should you put up a hurdle
in. the middle of the Domain, the chances are that your
gaping audience will insist upon mingling with you and
skirmishing round the biscuit-barrel—just as if it was the
good old prodigal relative multiplied by several.
And this reminds me that the other afternoon a big
man in a leather apron called in at The Bulletin office
wanting to know who authorised the Botanic Garden
officials to warn him off the public gardens lawn during
the progress of the private garden-party aforesaid.
Reading the fashion-jottings as they are concocted by
gifted local scribesses, one cannot help wondering where
“ Society ’’—really represented in all its beauty this side
of the line by wealthy or well-to-do folks, about whom it
is safest to ask no questions, but just judge them by the
size of their establishments or the silver on their harness
—begins and ends for some people. Under the heading
oft “Social Items,” the Miss Jenkins- of an evening paper
pens an ecstatic account of. a Sydney “ off-colour ” hop,
together with an inky shriek of rapture at the rags worn
by a. Gaiety dancer, now presiding over the domesticities
of a gentleman whose wife divorced him in consequence !
Of such, fortunately, isn’t “society,” but only- the “social
item.”
They are adding-new horrors to the surprise party in
Sydney. The invaders don’t even knock, but slip in
quietly with a borrowed latch-key.
On dit that when the long-expected naval wedding
comes off, the bride will be sister-in-law to her own siste”
as the gallant captain’s brother, an Albury surveyor'
married a sister of the former’s fiancee. Do you catch it ?
The second confessional-dodging of a “ Village Priest *
at Sydney Garrick on 20th ult., was a vice-regaTehullition
improved by a lovely managerial bouquet, hut even that
didn’t force a full d.c., from which one disloyally deduces
that V.R. in the amusement column isn’t so potent as it
used to he. The Faithful Few who did turn up, though,
were probably gratified at seeing more of dear Lady
Jersey than they bargained for. The vice-regal gown was
of black silk and lace, cut fore and aft in quite a capital V
with a cluster of cream and crimson flowers on the left
shoulder-strap, diamond and ruby necklace, and diamond
pins in her loosely arranged hair; wrap of scarlet plush
lined with quilted white satin and edged with ruchdd
silk to match. Mrs. Rupert Carington, who accompanied
her, looked pensive in pale pink, fairy-fied with cream
chiffon and a cluster of cream carnations, wrap in Indian
red cloth lined with pink silk. “ Chumley ” and “Girly ”
Goschen squired the party. There was no thrill about the
“Village P.” The actors mostly anticipated their cue 3
and tangled their English, like people who are too tired
Out to dot their i’s. Nethersole once said, “I snow’’for
“ I know ” (a gentle avowal, perhaps, that the Show was a
frost), at which Lady J. was wicked enough to laugh.
All through; the house regarded the tragic play With an
hilarious expression—especially in the cloister scene,
where the holy light is supposed to appear suddenly on
the Bible: As the Abbd led up to it by soliloquy the pea-
green heavenly radiance was being jerked all over the
stage—giving the Abbd green hair occasionally, and
suggesting that an ordinary bull’s-eye lantern can hit the
mark a lot sooner than a stage Providence. The dressing
was neat, but nothing startling. Nethersole, who took it
call gobbing in Cosgrove’s anus, revived that handsome
butterfly gown in grey silk and black-jet that she wore in
the “ warm ” scene of the “Idler.”
Upton what, I wonder, do women base their deep em-
phatic objection to going out by themselves? Women
always say “ I’ll go if you will,” or “I didn’t go—couldn’t
get a soul to go with me,” even when they’re only after
shopping. But the woman who really won't stir out
without what Becky Sharp calls a “sheep-dog” is the
dubious married flirt who hooks a companion to her
girdle and thinks she can chance it to rouge a little
deeper on the strength of her. One society woman—now
divorede—had a dowdy and demure female following cn
her heels up to the very last moment, who must have
been dreadfully in the way occasionally, or else her calm
and guileless face was a masterpiece; Actresses are never
seen without a mate—very ugly and hideously dressed as
a general principle; but always occupying the second
seat in the brougham cab. Indeed; the rule seems to be
that the smarter you are at adding two and two into four
the more need you have of a gooseberry. And yet it isn’t
the rule, either. I know one girl who simply won’t go
down the Block alone, and she isn’t a Very’ prettv girl
(now, I hope she won’t see this). She Cries out for a kin-
dred soul even if she’s only going to buy a reel of cotton.
Manly Wild Flower Show’ of ’9l can’t be counted in as
another big success because it was the most dismal floral
effort the industrious promoters have ever put forth.
Nearly every stall appeared to have been decorated by
the owner standing with her back to it and pitching the
native tulips over her head—when she could get them,
for there was a great scarcity of “ catch ’’ flowers, the
actinotus being especially few. Perhaps the stall one
least longed to throw’ stones at was the M.H.C.’s, with a
model of a yacht and the club houses; one dreary gap
was filled in by a stretch of sand and a contemplative
King Billy about to boil the last part of his nick-name on
a realistic Are. They disguised another hole in the show’
with bottled snakes, stuffed animals, and butterflies,
apparently because there weren’t enough flowers to go
round.
The thing began badly. Someone had seized the Jersey B
as they left their launch and rushed them, nolens volens,
all over the place, delaying the opening from 3.30 to
nearly 4 o’clock. Lots of Sydney people had come down
lunchless to be in time for the speeches, and these poor
starvelings couldn’t get even a sandwich until vice-royalty
had set “ it ” a-going ; so you can imagine the scramble
there was in the fodder-tent; where pretty amateur
waitresses spilt cups of tea, knocked over vases; and left
plates of pastry on the chairs, letting tat ladies sink
heavily on top of tarts and custard-rolls as if the thing
was a harlequinade. The Countess, who nervously set it all
in motion, sported <icrn; barred with yellow and trimmed
with gimp panels and vest, en sidle ; wide hat in black
gauze trimmed within a “tear a handful as you pass”
sort of way with convolvulus, buttercups, flowering grass,
poppies; all shrouded in a white tulle fall. The only other
lady on the dais was the local mayoress in yellow flora
pongde and a yellow bonnet trimmed with polyanthus,
and who presented Lady Jersey with a very elegant
bouquet of native flowers when she had finished the
speech. Then came cheers for the Jerseys, ending with
some for the Queen, but hardly anybody responded.
“ It’s not in nty line,” said one Manly celebrity, defiantly
Jamming on his grey silk belltopper. Sever before were
so many ’toppers seen in Our Village, which emphatically
sported its high hat On the occasion.
Talking about wild flowers, the Sydney Woman’s
Christian Temperance Union, which wants to abolish
everything but the pulpit and the tea-pot, has just very
fittingly decided that it’s emblem shall be a flannel-flower.
Flannel and old women are So inextricably mixed up that
a better symbol could hardly have been hit upon. And,
talking of the Union, the resolutions passed at their last
cackle show how some women love to run the universe
even if they only do it on paper. For instance, Mrs.
Harris (!) is “superintendent for influencing the pul-
pits!!” and Miss Laverty, ditto for “influencing the
press If!" I should just like to see her influencing the
heathen press with ginger beer 1
They are saying just now that you can’t have every-
thing, for if one Great Lady sets a bad example in one way
the next Personage is just as bad a model in another.
For instance, if Lady V. sets the female community
daubing its nose with powder, and its lips with carmine,
Lady Z., who doesn’t interpolate at all facially, puts rouge
out of court, but is responsible for a wide, blushable
snipping-ous of the tops of corsages de soirfe, because
she likes to be—er—cool after dinner.
When they give a ball at a hospital what becomes of the
inmates? Is the rheumatic sufferer carefully deposited
in the tool-shed, and the convalescent with the broken
leg stowed out of harm’s way k» the wash-house so that
the dormitory can be beeswaxed—in the same way as the
drawing-room chairs and tables hi Ordinary households are
carried into the back yard to make room? And doesn’t
the row interfere with the night’s rest of the patient with
brain-fever, and does the band bang loud enough to
smother the shrieks of the sufferer with the ear-ache ?
The story goes that Maud’s mamma, when up the
Mountains, was charmed by the usual gentlemanly
stranger whom she invited to visit her “in Sydney.” In
the interim Maud’s papa blew up, and the gentlemanly
unknown did call—as a bailiff. If this is all true, Sheriff
Cowper’s deputies must be improving vastly in their per-
sonal appearance.
The annual dance given by Professor West to his pupils
at Leigh Hall, on 24th ultimo, was a success, oven if it
did start at the weird period of 4 p.m. at which dread hour
the grown-up girl who came with a short petticoat under
her long white frock, somehow suggested thejnan in the
moon when the light got behind her. The dancing was
tip-top, especially the new dance (the waltz minuet) the
French cotillon and the English minueWtwo sisters in
cream Grecian dresses lined with yellow silk posing in the
latter with Sylvia Greyish grace. Also a random set of
eight little tibs went through an unrehearsed medley,
quickly picking out what dance was playing. Dainty
refreshments were served in the supper room, and the
card of 15 dances concluded at 8 p.m.
Yet another charity ball. Under the patronage and in
the presence of Gov. and Lady Jersey, the Mayor and
Mayoress of Sydney, &c., a hop will be held in Centennial
Hall on 10th Oct., in aid of the Illawarra and Western
suburbs cottage-hospitals.
Lord and Lady Jersey are to he present at the concert
in aid of the Paling Centennial Hospital, to be held in the
Town Hall on 15th instant.
The “Ho Tong” are rather puzzled about the goings
«n of a certain gallant A.D.C., whether he prefers lb- m”,
tately, pretty girl, who is without, or the petite dainty
little lady with the necessary “oof”; the knowing ones
are inclined to back the former, but “I don’t think he is
serious, my dear, ‘ merely amusin ’ himself.”
Mr. A. 11. Macarthur is to be married on the 30th
instant to Miss Blanche D.iveney, of New Zealand. The
wedding is to lake place in Melbourne.
1 hear that up to date Lady' Jersey hasn’t made up her
mind whether to attend or to successfully stay away from
the Tailorcsses’ ball, which comes off on the 23rd at Leigh
House, Gastlei’eagh-street. Probably if she isn’t broken
down and shattered with poems and literary 7 efforts, she
will ultimately' turn up.
£G1,450 worth of silver was last week
yielded by the Barrier mines.
It was remarked on Tuesday morning that
the Sydney daily papers, when they choose, can
be very “mum” on the subject of stoppages of
payment.
“ We, the Christian women of this land,
in convention assembled.” By’r lady ! The
Bulletin believes that the Lady Teetotallers are
half-sisters to the Female Gimlets.
Four N.S.W. barristers are in various
stages of bankruptcy proceedings, and ca sa
applications have, during the last month, been
granted against four others. These facts seem to
indicate a temporary lapse on the part of a gentle-
man who is said to “ take care of his own.”
A piece of “ the true Cross ” has arrived
at Bendigo, and it is stated that pilgrimages to
Bendigo are anticipated. They might as well
hold an auction of the wine that was made at
Cana. Native-born and State-school-eduoated
Australia is outside the region of such credulity.
Apropos of the labour troubles at Moonta
arid Wallatoo Mines (S.A.), it may be remarked
that the S.A. miners are worse treated and worse
paid than any others on the Australian continent.
Nearly all the best of the men who once made
these peninsula mining towns prosperous have
long ago migrated to Broken Hill.
N.S.W. Art Society keeps its exhibition
open till the end of the week, tip to date the
sales have been very bad. Under £lOO worth has
been bought for the National Gallery and the only
important canvas which has fallen into private
hands by straight-out purchase is Mr. Lister-
Lister’s excellent picture, bought by Mr. Wool-
cott-Waley.
One little fact from the case of the (Sydney)
Australian Mutual I. and B. Company (gone
bung)
Mr. Carl Simmat said he saw the manager of the com-
pany soon after payment was suspended, and ascertained
that all the properties were fully mortgaged. In Eliza-
beth-street there was a property which in 1887 was offered
for sale at £39,000, and he found that this now stood as
an asset on the society’s books of £77,000. (Cries of
“ Shame/’) The mortgage thereon was £32,000, whilst
the income was only about 30s. per week, from bill-
posters and other trifles.
The Bulletin takes the liberty of doubt-
ing the authenticity of the “ Diary of Lieutenant
Ralph Clark,” of H.M.S. Sirius —one of the
“hirst Fleet’’—which served as material for a
gossipy article in S.M. Herald of Sept. 20.
Where are the original MSS. ? How has the
Herald contributor satisfied himself that “the
typewritten copy ” is not a copy of screed vamped
from King and Hunter? In the given extracts
from the diary there is not a circumstance related
that is not to be found referred to in works
familiar to every student of the Australian past,
“ The British Government has recognised
the Junta, or Provisional Government of Chili.”
Just so. But yesterday the men who now com-
pose the Junta were scabby rebels, insurrection-
ists, insurgents, revolters, mutineers, traitors,
rioters, anarchists, seditionists, and—er—contu-
macious strikers. To-day, they form a Treaty
Power, whose flag must be saluted courteously.
Success justifies every rebellion, every crime even
—everything. A year ago, the working meri of
N.S, Wales were, in the eyes of the dominant
classes, so much trash and so much howling and
brutal discontent that Gatling guns and fixed
bayonets and knock-kneed special constables were
required to skim off their fermentation ; now, the
same dominant classes vie with each other as to
who shall bow lowest to their new-found idol, the
working man. And that is just why the Illawarra
working man should stick like wax to Nicholson
and Lysaght, and particularly toNicholson, at this
Saturday’s election.
David Christie Murray writes concerning
TnE Bulletin in the Contemporary Review for
August, 1801 :
The Bulletin’ is very capably Written and
edited. The brightest Australian verse and
the best Australian stories find their way into
its columns. Its illustrations are sometimes
brilliant, though the high standard is not
always maintained. And having thus spoken
an honest mind in its favour, I leave myself
at liberty to say that it is probably' the
wrongest-headed and most mischievous jour-
nal in the world. People try to treat it as a
neglectable quantity when they disagree with
it. But I have seen as much of the surface of
the country, and as much of its people as
most men, and I have found the pestilent
print everywhere, and everywhere have found
it influential.
The Bulletin is not at present concerned with
its critic’s opinions, but with his statement of
fact: “I HAVE SEEN AS MUCH OE THE
SURFACE OF AUSTRALIA AND AS MUCH
OF ITS PEOPLE AS MOST MEN 7 . I HAVE
FOUND The Bulletin EVERYWHERE.
AND EVERYWHERE HAVE FOUND IT
INFLUENTIAL.” Let people remember the
fact, known to every man who travels—that THE
BULLETIN is the ONLY paper which has a
thorough Australasian circulation. The inter-
provincial circulation of any other Australian
weekly is but a shadow of that of The Bulletin.
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Go’s. “Cascade”
80 & 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is just
the place; it is certainly the largest and best
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*
EPITHALAMIUM.
Let the bride blush—it is fit.
Slave in the market-place, sold
To the clinking and chiming of gold,
While all know the manner of it—
Let the bride blush when she meets
Bold, painted Sin on the streets.
And now, after this little thing of my own, believe me
to remain,
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

In “The Sundowner,” now being nlavnd
at Sydney Garrick, George Darrell starts, aphar
ently for the express purpose of outraging L,
bability, and adheres faithfully to the
throughout. The giddy but faithful young w f f “
of Ins hero, Major “ Ned’Mllversleigh, “ tllf S ,
downer,” having fainted, is carried off bv
husband’s false friend (Robert Inman) and lomidl
oil the settee into his arms, comatose but kicking
while the husband,*suffering from a spear-wonim
inflicted by the Zulus, spins round like a liuinmi
top and falls flatly, very flatly, with the top 0 f
skull to the footlights, a mountain of broadcloth
topped with a snow-white waistcoat. In the next
act he looms up largely, just out of a lunatio
asylum, though from his garb one might suppose
he had just stepped down from the window of a
waxworks. Arrived on the station of an idiotic
squatter and his impossible wife (Jenny Watt
Tanner) he induces them, aided and abetted bv a
tract-delivering incubus (Polly Emery), a badly
drawn dude (H. Diver), and the simulacrum' c f' a
young Australian (Arthur Greenaway), to s‘and
in a broiling sun for some minutes while
he tells them how he, “ Dare-devil Ned ”
rode and boxed, danced and gambled and
fought for the Queen and the honour of' Hold
Hmgland, and then, arrayed in a bed-curtain
shirt, corduroys and Hessian - boots, rushes
from the peaceful home, whence he would have
been sooled by dogs twenty minutes previously i n
real life, brandishing a bread-knife and an usher’s
wand, and yelling, “Up boys, and at ’em!”
This fraudulent attempt at the impersonation of
an Australian type, however, toon returns ap
parently for his billy, and, recognising his’wife
(Christine Darrell), now a governess, faints
again after a heroic struggle with her
abductor who comes on at this stage, promiscuou -
like. Somehow or other after this “the Sun-
downer” regains his reason and his bank-
balance unexpectedly. Then the noble young
squatter is stabbed by the villain, and the fourth
act, a histrionic horror, is devoted to the re-
conciliation of wife and husband and the un-
masking of the villain, who washes down bread-
pills witli cold tea in sight of the audience and
Walks off handcuffed to die a miserable death by
poison on his way to the dungeon. The play is
also illuminated by the conventional stage Irish-
man, who twinkles at intervals in the persoh of
Hi Shine ; an unearthly and unnecessary larrikin,
harmoniously handled by A. G. Poulton; and a
French maid of the “Bleak House” brand, but
much deteriorated by travel, convulsively wrestled
with by Constance Deorwyn. George Darrell
doesn’t seem to have much faitli in the drama
himself, and usually plays in a humble and apolo-
getic way as though to say, “ Don’t heave a brick
at me, I don’t mean any harm !” As for Christine
Darrell, she has a sweet voice, a nice stage
presence, and plays just about as well as We
expected;

The run of “A Celebrated oase,” at
Sydney Her Majesty’s, has been marked by
a continuous congregation of lonesomeness around
the pay-boxes and in the circle, doom has slid
silently into the stalls and stolen secretly upstairs
into the family circle and gallery. So far, how-
ever, it does not seein to have altogether taken
possession of the stage, where the company still
goes manfully on its uphill track. If Clifton
Alderson were not so stagey ho would prove
acceptable to most people, and Laura Yilliers
might become a positive favourite were her tasks
more apportioned to her abilities. The trouble
will be mitigated on Saturday night by a change
of the place attacked by the dramatic neuralgia,
for Jerome K. Jerome’s “Woodbarrow Farm”
will be produced for the first time in Sydney.

“ Led Astray,” having revived business at
Sydney Criterion, will occupy the bills until
Wednesday, October 7, when Marie Fraser will
make het first Australian appearance in a
brand-new play, “Sunlight and Shadow,” now
running at London St. James's.

Folks are getting a bit tired of the bar-
room and race-course jokes with which the “Blase
Roue” is upholstered, and so “Cinder-Ellen” will
be hailed with glee on Monday evening. A
decadence of theatrical taste as evinced in the
growing liking for burlesque and comic opera is
continually taken for granted, nevertheless, we
incline to think that the deterioration has no
foundation in fact. People simply go to theatres
for different reasons nowadays. In early days
they went to stimulate their brains, now they go
to ease them. In burlesque they have discovered a
gorgeous and brainless pastime which thoroughly
amuses them while enabling them to indulge in
that spice of vulgarity which is secretly dear at
heart to even the most straitlaced of Adam’s sons
and Eve’s sisters. Burlesque, especially Gaiety
burlesque, is idiotic and imbecile, but it requires
no translation or explanation, and keeps folks from
yawning, therefore it pleases. It has been re-
marked that Nellie Barren has acquired, oris
attempting to acquire since her American tours,
some twang of American speech and manner.
Indeed, one of her essays in melody is clearly a
plantation walk-around. It’s a mistake, the
humours are entirely different and don’t blend

Auguste Wiegand’s organ recitals continue
, draw more than half-houses in the afternoons
d fairly full houses in the evenings at Sydney
Town Hall. A great crowd, chiefly ladies, sat
entranced through a long programme, classic
Terns included, the other afternoon. The only
dissentient was a baby in the body of the hall,
vho swallowed a programme and at once entered
1 protest. Perhaps the most popular item was
Gounod’s lovely serenade, given with the remark-
able effect of the celestial voice singing the air
well in front with all the sympathy of a human
bein'*, sustained by a muffled chorus of far-away
gera phs. That sort of refining and educating in-
fluence should be given away free occasionally.

It is probable that the event of Eight
Hour Day (Monday, Oct. sth) will be the labour-
picnic to Rosehill. In addition to sports of
various kinds, in fact of every kind, prizes,

\Vyburd also celebrates the day by opening his
aquarium with 18 complete shows. At Coogee,

“The Gondoliers” at Adelaide Royal has
proved a source of revenue quite phenomenal,
and with the exception of the Sara Bernhardt
season, during which the prices of admission were
considerably raised, the takings, so far, have
knocked out the record. Treasurer Tallis is
haggard and prematurely aged with counting the
dollars, and Pete Hughes’ smile has been so hard-
worked that it had to be re-soled. The opera
itself has bewitched the Adelaide public—from
the viceroy down to the humble citizen who fills
the position of dog-drowner to the Corporation.
Violet Varley deserves special mention for her
bright, vivacious acting and charming ringing.
The little lady has shown wonderful improvement.
Flora Graupner does all she knows, and Florence
Young has captivated many a heart. Elsie
Cameron warbles like an artist; Charles Ryley is
a pronounced hit; Syd. Deane grows in favour ;
and the old favourites, Elton, Vernon, Bracy and
Co. maintain their reputation. M. Leon Caron
conducts the orchestra in a masterly style. Owing
to the limitation of the season, “ The Gondoliers ”
must give way to “lolanthe” and “Charity
Begum at Home,” which go up as a double bill.
Stacey, surrounded by a creditable little company,
a dog, and a swarm of “little kiddies,” has been
doing satisfactory business at Garner’s Theatre
with “Hans the Boatman” and “My Sweet-
heart.”

“Merry Wives of Windsoa ” did a good
first week’s business at Melbourne Royal, but
already the roars of public hilarity are relaxing
their vigour, and the crowd in the vestibule grows
stealthily less. People respect the production,
which is bright and solid and correct looking,
more heartily than they enjoy Shakespeare’s farce.
They do their best to accept the Falstaff of this
play as the “immortal creation,” and struggle
desperately to shake with merriment on the mis-
understanding that he is a barrel of personal
humour, instead of a butt for practical jokers.
All the while he is getting himself placed in
ridiculous situations, and lured on to make an
object of himself. This Falstaff is not the
unctuous plump Jack of “Henry the Fourth,” the
droll old soaker, the mediaeval J B. Buckstone,
who sets the tavern table in a roar, but merely a
hot-headed stout person, befooled by all who meet
him and held up to ridicule in a week’s “wash ”
a very dirty wash, too, suggesting that merry
wives never went in largely for Windsor soap.
And how, by the way, a buck-basket full
of linen manages to take in eighteen stone
of human fat without getting any fuller is a con-
juring trick which The Bulletin would like the
deceased Bard to explain. But no matter. “The
Merry Wives ” has many negative virtues in
addition to the positive charm of the scenery and
appointments. In the first place, it is more than
three hundred years old, and a valuable relic to
begin with. It is giddy in a ponderous sort of
way, and quite delightfully free from anything
resembling a stage villain, as tha.t old and popular
article is generally regarded. Seldom do you get
so much scenery without a villain, for even panto-
mimes abound in crime. Master Ford, indeed,
certainly does organise a picnic-party with the
idea of “showing them a monster,” but Ford,
who, en passant, is a deplorable ass, fails in his
fell purpose. The monster lies concealed amongst
a lot of stockings and unmentionables, and he
wouldn’t be really wicked if they fished
him out. Now, if Falstaff were a sur-
reptitious dude with an insinuating moustache
and a sidelong glance, and if the women
fainted when he told his love, instead of burying
him in shirts and chemisettes, then he would be a
reckless profligate and vile seducer of the deepest
dye. The boys would hoot him dreadfully when
he came, pale and languid, before the curtain. It
is a melancholy fact that the world, and theatre
gallery, excuse in an absurd fat man the very same
lack of principle which is so disgusting in the thin
roue. There is much about “ The Merry Wives ”
to set the philosopher pondering in the gloaming,
or cogitating over during the silent watches of the
eight (not that watches ever are silent in the night
when you wind ’em up). So there is in a football-
match or Sunday-school outing. Life seems to be
full up of reflection. The Rignold company are
still doing ample justice to Divine William’s
ancient jest, albeit Falstaff might well baste his
two myrmidons with more realism, and the
treasury ought to equal current liabilities for
another week.

“Jane” is about to leave off tickling
uncle Anson’s bald head with a spoon, at the
bijou, and even “Hook and Eye” must shortly
be withdrawn. On Saturday next (Oct. 3rd) they
intend to put on “ A Pair of Spectacles ” and tell
the rollicking, newly-married virgin to clear out.
She is a nice girl, and the finish of her is sure to
be in great demand.

“Rigoletto” secured four satisfactory
attendances at the Alexandra last week, but
“ Nonna ” was inclined to be a little off. Each
performance of the former opera has endorsed a
well-established opinion that Madame Simonsen
brought genuine talent over from Italy. Such
people as Melossi, the Cutticas, and Travaglini
act almost as well as they sing, and only need
more expensive surroundings to make their
strength properly appreciated. The performance
of the principals in “Rigoletto” is more than
good. It is first-class, Guidotti made her re-
appearance last Monday in “II Trovatore.” The
same artiste will give her well-rested voice a show
in “Norma,” during the week, and on Saturday
the Cutticas will wrestle with “The Barber.”

Considering that “musical comedy” at
Melbourne Princess’s seems almost as wicked and
irreverent as fireworks in a Baptist Chapel, the
general result of “ Kindred Souls,” on Saturday
night, was better than it might have been.
“Kindred Souls,” in its literary aspect, is witless
and maddening—a crazy patchwork of old devices
clumsily stitched together. Nevertheless the
people employed to lighten the darkness contrive
to do something extravagantly comic every now
and then, and a performance inherently silly
becomes as amusing as acting can make it. The
songs that some of them put their lips to when
they feel so dispoged, and which ought to be in-
troduced by a chairman with a little hammer and
a few words to the audience, don’t go far towards
condoning the offence. A solitary exception is a
drinking ditty—“ Flow thou purple stream”—
which Snazelle trolls forth in genuine
operatic style. One can’t call any purple
poison to mind, but that’s only a minor
detail. Perhaps the drinks provided by the
management are of a reddish cerulean hue.
Maggie Moore contributes a very poor
music-hall chant, and Gourlay seems to have laid
violent hands upon “ The Miser ” (which poor old
Georgie Leybourne sang of yore), and rung a
gruesome change on the words. Taking the thing
as it stands, with all its sins upon its head,
“Kindred Souls ” is an improvement on the last
Opera House revival, inasmuch as the ladies are
smarter, and Royee takes a part. Snazelle would
be the soul of the affair only it hasn’t got a soul,
and he seemed to make it go furiously at times.
“ Our Flat ” is likely to be wanted very shortly,
all the same.
** * *
Rice’s “ Corsair ” is to re-open the Opera
House on Saturday. The MacMahons announce
that “The Corsair” has been a remarkable success
elsewhere, and they “ rest with perfect confidence
upon the verdict of a Melbourne audience.”
Meanwhile they must be reposing on the non-
existent, which doesn’t alter the fact that “ The
Corsair ” is a wholesale leg-show coming at an
opportune moment.

Halls, Cycloramas, Waxworks, ete., are
flourishing as usual, but the new Olympia, in
Flinders-street, has closed its doors after a brief
tempestuous season of two hours, or so. A thou-
sand people, mostly bank-clerks and mashers of
middle grade, tried a shillingsworth of Olympia
on Saturday night, under the harmless delusion
that a Grand National Bazaar and Beauty Show
had commenced. It never struck them that
Saturday would be a bad night for getting beau-
ties together, and when they found a dreary
expanse of floor dotted over by eight small stalls, ten
fearful female apparitions and a brass band, the
boys wanted to take up their “bobs” and walk.
Unfortunately, the arrangements for returning
money at the doors were as defective as the beauty-
supply, and nobody came forward to explain that
the loveliest woman engaged had been unable to
come. In point of fact, the defaulting Cleopatras
were tubbing their grandchildren, or getting in
the vegetables for Sunday, and their absence was
unavoidable under the circumstances. They
couldn’t get themselves cleaned in time to roll up
and compete for a prize of £5O, set apart by
generous management for the angel who had
fewest squints and most teeth. A riot naturally
ensued. One by one the eight stalls were over-
turned, and from a wild chaos of nuts, oranges,
tobacco, scent-bottles and beauty, each patron
grabbed what he could. A rumour that one of
the oldest lumps of loveliness, who was too lame
to run away, had been torn to pieces and dis-
tributed as mementoes of the occasion was current
in Melbourne when this notice left.
At Poverty Point.
George Leitch has lately been lying low in various quiet
localities to let his hair grow, and having wandered to
Zeehan (Tas.) he, at latest advices, had organised a syndi-
cate, and was preparing to start a big theatre. This
establishment is to have a huge auditorium, billiard and
refreshment rooms, offices, shops, a commodious stage,
and, if possible, George Leitch himself to open the show ;
and already all the shares are taken up. If Zeehan Con-
tinues to boom it will be a great and noble speculation ;
if the bottom falls out of Zeehan then the grass will grow
on the stage, and goats will ponder among the scenery,
and the local farmer will rise up and grow corn in the
auditorium. For the present, however, everything looks
brilliant, and there are prospects everywhere. Gouty
speculators come along, and curse because they
damage their toes against the valuable specimens
that lie around in the roads. There are boulders
of virgin ore at every corner, and they come
in handy for dogs to rub themselves against, Zeehan
being the only place on the face of the earth where the
lost cur scratches himself with pure silver. The popula-
tion steals most of the macadam off the roads and
secretly pounds it up for the sake of the precious metal
in it, whereby the highways get into a bad condition.
Everybody is crawling under his house, and clawing the
silver out of the foundations, and in very wet weather
landslides of hard cash are frequent, and people have to
keep out of the way lest they should be brained through
specie payment falling on them. Consequently Zeehan
looks a promising place to run a theatre, especially as the
star comedian can fill in his spare time by grubbing the
money out of the foundations. These statements are
supported by the affidavits of all the horse-thieves of the
island.
The fact that Owen Harris joins Myra Kemble to play
the name part in “ Dr. Bill,” and Charlie Shackleton in
“ Jane,” shows that Owen is getting on.
The old Australian favourite, Sir William Don, was

Lady de Grey says she expects Frances Savile to create

When Dominick Murray, the Irish comedian, and

An apparently Hebraic tailor at Broken Hill (N.S.W.)
advertises that the original Holy Coat has been sent to
his shop for repairs, and somehow' this par got tacked
on to Alf. Dampier’s theatrical notice. Rossibly Dampier
is short of humour, for he writes to the paper repudiating
the unsavoury outrage, and denying that he has any hand
in putting new tails on the sacred garment.
The Simonsens can’t get an opening in Sydney with the
new opera company for some months to come, even if the
company manage to escape the influenza and hold
together. They are due in Adelaide and Brisbane at
earlier dates.
George Rignold advertised that though the part of
Master Ford was subordinate to that of Falstaff, he
trusted it would be considered to add additional strength
to the cast. No part can strengthen or weaken a cast of
characters, anyway. Besides, George’s mixed advt.
would almost seem to imply that he wrote the part him-
self.
Jonel Sullivan and Jack Ashton dropped into Melbourne
Royal the other night and sat out “The Merry Wives”
quite seriously.
Laurence Aubrey Desborough, known on the stage as

Sheridan’s agent, Vincent West, is in Hobart Hospital
with typhoid. West ought to be careful where nurses are
concerned. Not long ago a constable w'as placed in that
hospital to watch a suspected man. He entered the
establishment a gay, unfettered bachelor, but, falling a
victim to the charms of the nurse who attended the
suspect, he left it “ engaged,” in consequence of which
much tribulation has fallen on that nurse’s relations, and
she was packed off to Sydney straight away.
George Leitch took a cruel rise out of a brother artist
at the N.S.W. Art Society’s smoke concert last Saturday.
He gave a song which purported to be Johnel Sullivan’s
first attempt as an operatic star, said melody also pur-
porting to be Johnel’s own composition. The production
was so like what the slugger would produce, and the way
it was sung was so horribly and fiendishly like the way
the slogger would sing it, that if he had been there he
would have resigned his stage billet on the spot.
More parachute troubles to hand. Viola, the little
Ballarat girl who married Aeronaut “ Van Tassell” Price,
was caught in an upper air whirlwind at Kataming, W.A.
The parachute collapsed, but the lady, landing in the
branches of a dead tree, escaped with a few bruises.
Says New Orleans Picayune of Olive Berkeley, reported
dead at the same time as Harry Edwards: “It is safe to
say that no little woman in the world of no more than 12
years can play Galatea so well as Olive Berkeley played it

Olive is an old-fashioned twelve-year-old.

Adcock, the insolent Adelaide insolvent, got up an
amateur performance, at Melbourne Princess’s, many
years ago—two pieces of his own writing, one a drama of
the “Queer Client,”in which he acted, while the audience

He will be much regretted.
According to Pinero, nowadays we can have no real
comedy because strict comedy is an artificial reflection of
manners, and to-day we have no manners, we cannot
dance the minuet, handle a fan or cane, and know not
how to take snuff. Yes, but just look how we can smoke
cigarettes and stuff stick-knobs into our mouths.

Clara Morris had occasion to complain to the carpenter
of a way-back American theatre about the general mal-

“According to a statement in a Melbourne paper, Teddy
Royce was taken ill with rheumatism at Dunedin during
his last trip to Maoriland. Further, by the same authority,
liis landlady was a Good Samaritan who shed tears over
his sufferings, and resolved to cure him, and in pursuance
of this kindly resolution she rose early one morning, and
filled the bath with hot water. Then she burst into
Royce’s room, and next moment she emerged with a small
and three-parts-naked comedian howling under one arm
and a huge sponge in her hand. After that there were
wild shrieks and execrations from the bath-room, and
sounds like a very small actor being violently bobbed up
and down in very hot water, and kicking frantically in
the process. Apparently he was hanging on with all four
legs to the side of the bath, and the Good Samaritan was
shoving him in by sheer violence. Anyhow, the tumult
died away in course of time and there was a great calm.
And by-and-bye the landlady made a fresh bolt for the
bed-room with a bright-red but convalescent comedian
under her arm, and a towel in her other hand, and as Royce
re-appeared at the theatre that night the treatment was
evidently a success. As this story will roost likely be
denounced as a fabrication we rise up and indignantly
contradict it ourselves before going any further.
Answers to Correspondents.
“A.M‘G.”; We don’t so much object to the
anti-liquor laws as to the professional anti-liquor crowd
who are a hideous set of milk-and-water tyrants....
“F.A.C.”: Horrible rot... “R.R.W.” (Brewarrina): We
have read your verses. They are the very last human
possibility in the way of cow-headed drivel “ T.J.P.” :
We have read at least two stories with exactly the same
plot before. It isn’t much of a plot, anyhow L.J.P.”:
Acrostic first-rate. A bachelor 400 years of age even
might present it to a girl of 120 without any damage
Wish you every encouragement “Lothario S.
Tweezer”: Will publish when space permits “Jim
Christie ” (Townsville): We regret to dispel your illusion.
There isn’t an Englishman or a University man on the
premises. Perhaps just as well, for that combina-
tion is usually duller than a Dorcas meeting
“Verax”: Very likely you would be compelled by
the court to pay your lawyer £lO more than the costs
he collected from the other side. Your only remedy—if
you have a remedy—would be to consult another lawyer
with a view to taking action against him. However, dog
doesn’t eat dou, and your last? state would be worse than
your first. As he has only collared a quarter of your
money you may think yourself lucky “ Claus M.” :
Letter for you addressed to Oineo “C.W.” (Fitzroy) :
Thanks. Tub Bulletin laughs at the envious jibes of
such impotent competitors. The Bulletin has in Mel-
bourne alone a bigger circulation than the entire issue of
the paper from which you clip. Both the latter and the
rag it tries to boost up have the sweat of Death upon their
pallid brows “R.W.” (Qympie): Poem received. The
whole staff is coming up per cheap excursion, to ask you
with axes what you mean by it “ G. 8.” (Moonbi):
Thanks. Will attend to it “Wat Tyler”: Quite our
sentiments. By-the-bye, we rather like your expression
“ monarchs and other bloated gobble-crats,” although we,
as a rule, object to the cant phrases of politics.. “F.M.L.”
(Ballarat): Unctuous poems about food are not in our
line “E.C.U.”; Idea not bad. Metre horribly bumpy.
Rhyme nowhere... “ T.L.”(Brisbane): Many thanks...
“ R.S.” (Sydney): Declined with thanks “J.A.C.”
(N.Z.): With unobtrusive frankness we inform y6u that
the “Diary” is no good “F.. Somerset” (Melb.):
Many thanks... “R.S.” (Lucknow); Good story. The
bad odour will be excused for the sake of the plot.
Meanwhile the office keeps to windward ...“Poona-
moota ” (Essendon): We would just as soon publish a bag
of guano....“ Joseph R.”: Little goody : goody, Sunday-
school bun-struggle parables about sparrows and frogs
are treated with contempt and a sinful leer “ M.M.8.”
(Mansfield): Your paragraphs rouse us to fury. For the
sake of your aged mother, lie 10w... “ D. 8.” (Sydney):
Will look it up “Slim Jim”: Much good and pic-
turesque cursing in it. When the cursing is taken out
there is nothing left., “E.M.W.”; Humorous story, but
told in wild, coarse, disjointed bullockdriverese ..
“John Arum”: You don’t send address “Old Sub-
scriber ” : Truly this is poetry:—
he replied, oh, 1 only asked you the date.
I said, but why do you ask me ?
Said he, because I wished to know the date
& torn, said he, will you tell me ?
We publish this warning so that you may have as long a
start as possible before an infuriated nation is howling on
your track... “Treas.”: The daily papers shouldn’t gc
into matters of pedigree unless they are prepared to give
us the whole of the thing “F.C.”: The W.P.B. had
need of it:. ..“E. T. Cudmore”: Why shouldn’t a man
who has been committed for trial have a vote? Every
man is legally innocent until proved guilty. Besides, the
electoral disability under which the man who has been
committed for trial lies is on the average purely a mone-
tary one. A man is allowed bail in almost every case
save a murder charge ; so, if he has enough coin, he can
get out of gaol and vote, his pommittal notwithstanding.
“ Kunnnanavad Rinok”: Thanks “P.J.M’M.”
(Prahran): Horse-yarn pathetic, but utterly, hopelessly
improbable. When a horse saves a man’s life, he first
wallops the faithful steed and then sells it for sausages.
... “ Cooramin ” (Toowoomba, Q.): Too long. Moreover,
have article in type on same subject.. .. “J.F.” (Mildura):
Thanks ; but the article is long, and space is short, and
Wales is getting stale “C.K.” (Mudgee): Will read
carefully. ..“Daisy” (Brisbane): Poem found in your
brother’s clothes is'too riotous for a paper like The Bul-
letin, which circulates extensively in mothers’-meetings
and ladies' schools “ Mohawk”: Certainly.... “ A Tent
Dweller”: Received with thanks “Vagabond”: “A
Suicide’s Contemplations ” has many good points, and
three bad ones—(l) metre rocky, (2) rhymes dreadfully
weak, (3) the pious suicide who dies with the Bible in
one hand and the “goblet ” in the other is played out
“ J. 0.” (Murrumburrah): Will think hard over the less
blasphemous parts of your poem “W.T.” (Newtown):
Good story, but not in our line. Moreover, the “Judge’s
Address ” is an old white-haired chestnut that was un-
veiled 1000 years ag0....“0ne of the Geese”: The
Bulletin doesn’t believe in making the lawyer a State
official. Its conviction is that he is utterly unnecessary,
and that laws, as well as Sunday-school tracts, can
be written in plain English, so that any man can under-
stand them without expensive outside assistance. In
the days when only Latin Scriptures were allowed,
the priest had just the same monopoly as the lawyer.
But people have found out that he isn’t indispensable ...
“E. 0.”: No one claims that insane people should vote.
Asylum idiots should no more have voting privileges than
the life-privileged idiots of the Legislative Council
“An Admirer ”: If all your yarns are the same as sample
do not waste penny stamps on S.S “C.S.”: The Bul-
letin spends more in one week upon its illustrations alone
than its critic does in a quarter on literature—unless the
latter pays for its matter 400 per cent, more than it is
worth “E- Marcombe ”: You can buy N.S.W. Hansard
now for threepence a copy. Read it regularly for a month
and compare it with the press reports “Walter M.”:
We don’t yet know enough about the facts of the case to
say whether Balmaceda was a patriot or a selfish tyrant.
There is as much reason, so far as present evidence goes,
for believing him to have been the former as the latter....
“A.M'L.”: The amalgamated legal system has worked
splendidly in South Australia for years past with the
result that you have in that province a little more free-
trade in law than can be obtained elsewhere... “ Anti-Q.”
(J.E., S.M.): Letter for you addressed S. Melbourne
“ M.” (Inverell): We admit that District Court Judge
Murray has a faultless record, so far as a man can have
one, and that he, equally with Judge Backhouse, has
strong claims for advancement to the Supreme Court
Bench. There are, however, several D.C. Judges whom
it would be perfectly ludicrous to seat in the Supreme
Court—just as it is perfectly ludicrous to nominate to
that Court the battered, respectable, spineless weaklings
who often get there through political manoeuvring and as
the result of personal canvass. There are now on N.S.W.
S.C. Bench only three, or, at most four, men who, in the
opinion of lawyers and of the intelligent public, are fit to
be there at a 11.... “H.H.” (Sydney): The Bulletin has
said more, and said it more strongly against Booth’s
scheme than any other paper. It is utter bosh to
sav that the big-drum colonists would “strengthen
the democracy.” They are pledged to abject grovelling
obedience to the Army, which accepts its orders
from abroad, and no slave can help democracy.
They have learned to regard £1 per week as riches, and
would worship the boss who gave them 30s. And if they
were any good they would have shaken up the English
democracy long ago, but they didn’t, for there was no
fight in them.
An excess of animal food and a partial closing
of the pores of the skin, during the winter months
cause the system to become filled with impurities;
These a/-e removed and the blood purified by
taking Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.

•General Booth’s portraits flatter him.
A publican who is also an M.A. has just
retired from “ trade ” in Maryborough, Q.
Governor Sir William Robinson, of W.A.
is off to England again for six months. He’s a
regular six months Bill.
The presence of “ General ” Booth in Aus-
tralia naturally induces the question, “ What has
become of Blue Ribbon Booth ?
J. P. Abbott, Speaker of the N.S.W.
Assembly, was one of the party sent to Lambing
Flat “to maintain law and order.”
Be District Court Judges and the N.S.W-
Supreme Bench—Sir George Innes was a D.C.
Judge in Queensland in the sixties.
By this time almost everybody has heard
of the polite question asked at dinner of the
social lion Landor by the poet Parkes.
(hi dit that Mr. F. W. Ward, late editor
of Sydney D.T., has accepted an editorial position
on the Daily Chronicle— undoubtedly the coming
London daily.
Sir Henry Wylie Norman, of Queensland,
draws as his Governor’s salary exactly £4OOll
IDs, lid. The odd penny goes to swell the
unexpended balances.
It is remarked in Melbourne that General
Booth is not a bit like his Army, but still the
Methodist preacher. As different from his fol-
lowers as Disraeli from his.
“ I have actually given the last shilling I
have had to those who have wanted it more than I
myself did ; I have done that many a time,” says
Parkes. Creditors, we presume.
Seymour Lucas, R.A., killed last week in
a Spanish railway collision, is represented in the
Melbourne National Gallery by a very good
picture—“ The Armada in Sight.”
Most of the Free Kirk ministers in the
North of Scotland have decided that Tummy is
past praying for, and now omit his name from the
concluding prayer of their church service.
Tom Garrett is fast declining physically.
111-health hobbles him indoors, and he seldom
leaves his Newtown residence nowadays. Bis
quondam toadies now ignore his ebbing fortunes.
Sir John Hay will shortly retire,
rumour, from the chair of the N.S.W. Legislative
Council. His successor will be either A. H. Jacob,
W. H. Suitor, or John Lackey. The nomination
rests with the Governor.
When “Bobby” Lowe was at Oxford he
was president of the famous Union, and once fined
an obnoxious speaker a pound for disorderly con-
duct. The unruly one paid up—and became after-
wards Archbishop of Canterbury.
When W. S. Gilbert floated his Duke in
“The Gondoliers’’into a joint-stock company he
was, of course, unaware that years previously
Marcus Clarke, in one of his sparkling “Peripa-
tetic Philosopher ” papers, had prettily used the
same notion.
Rear-Admiral Stephenson, C. 8., is to
succeed Rear-Admiral Scott on the Australian
station, according to English authorities who
ought to know. The reason for his promotion
above senior veterans is—he is an Equerry to the
Prince of Wales!
John Lang’s well-known books, which,
under the titles of “ Assigned to his Wife ’ and
“ Botany Bay,” are to be seen in every bookshop,
originally appeared, the first in Fraser's Maga-
zine as “Emily Orford,” and the second in
Household Words.
Charles Dickens always had his eye on the
Australias. In 1849 letters were received in Syd-
ney from him stating his intention to settle in
Australia. In the sixties, again, he cast lingering
looks thusward. But he didn’t come. Only his
sons came ! Alas, and alack !
Mr. N. R. D. Bond, the nominal secretary
of the V.A.T.C., has we regret to hear returned
from a health trip to England—he was a fellow-
passenger with General Booth—in a very bad
way, mentally and physically. His medical
attendants in Melbourne consider the case hope-
less.
Sir Henry Parkes is the bread-winner of
three families. In addition to his young family
by his young wife, he supports an aged sister at
Faulconbridge, on the Blue Mountains, and the
daughters of his youth, several of whom are
widows, in a suburb easily accessible from Hamp-
ton Villa, Balmain.
The phrase, “my intimate personal rela-
tions with William Charles Wentworth,” has
fallen trippingly from Parkes’ tongue twenty
times within the last five years. We have no
reason to believe that Parkes ever spoke to
Wentworth in his life, though he satin the same
Chamber with him for some years.
The ashes of Madame Blavatsky are to be
divided between Madras, London, and New
York. If fat made ashes every town under
heaven might have a sackfull of the ugly old
witch. And if conscious imposture made ashes
you could with the remains of old Mother Blavat-
sky fix up all the cinder-tracks in Christendom.
Judge Windeyer is now regarded as a
probable Chief Justice of N.S.W. when Dnrlev
retires. Windeyer wears the trappings which Sir
Alfred Stephen wore so long as Chief Justice. If
Crick’s Bill reaches the Statute-book, the judicial
“duds” will have to do elsewhere, perhaps in
Yandemonia, which clings to its Stephen-made
laws.
“General” Booth still has the Notts
accent, but he has apparently been chaffed out of
rubbing his hands, like Varley’s reminiscence of
the old butcherly “ Buy ! Buy 1” With all his
experience, he hesitates somewhat in public speech,
and ever and anon catches himself up, repeating
words, after which he will stamp and pass both
hands through his yet flowing locks.
Clement Wragge, Queensland’s weather-
prophet, is an oddity. Some years ago, perhaps
in a fit of absent-mindedness, he took unto himself
a wife. Ihe honeymoon was spent in a trip to
Europe. Wragge was a source of amusement on
the mail-boat. At any and almost every hour of
the night he used to leave his bride to take some
observations; some nights he hardly left the deck.
Mr. Arnold Wise, son of the late Mr.
Justice Wise (N.S.W.), and brother to the
member for South Sydney, was married last
month in the Isle of Wight, to Miss Shorthand,
iii T U ? t er °f °ld Hr. Shortland, of Auckland,
(ALL.), one of the most accomplished Maori
scholars living, and certainly one of the most
interesting conversationalists in the Southern
hemisphere.
When Simpson, Q.C., reaches the S.C.
Pencil, Salomons, Q.C., will be the “father” of
the practising N.S.W. Bar, of which he has long
been the leader. Salomons was admitted to prac-
tice in January, ’6l, at Gray’s Inn. Henry Cary
Hangar, M.L.C., was admitted at Middle Temple
tour years before Salomons, but then he never
practised, although the legal members in the
Council style him their “learned friend.”
One of the Chief Justices of N.S : W. was
once arrested as a bushranger by the Penrith
police. Which fact confirms the old-time conten-
tion of The Bulletin that if the evening papers

SWAGMAN (to squatter): “Any work, boss?”
SQUATTER: “No!”
SWAGMAN: “ Well, can you give us a feed, then ? ”

SQUATTER “I have fed too many of your sort lately.”

were to pre-judge by their facial characteristics
the occupants of a certain Supreme Court Bench
as they now do to the point of conviction every
penniless man charged with a sensational offence
of a heinous nature, some of the wearers of the
ermine would be pronounced worthy of hanging.
When A. G. Taylor was ejected, years
ago, from the N.S.W. Assembly,'he was stone-
walling the military estimates. He had been cn
the qui vivc for some hours before these estimates
were reached ; and in order not to be starved out
of his revenge on his former military masters he
had come provided with a larder. A roll of
Tribune proofs, a box of sardines, a bag of
biscuits, and a soda-water bottle of something,
possibly whisky and water, weie lying by
Taylor’s side when the Sergeant-at-arms arrested
him.
Venerable James Bon wick—a name which
will be regarded with gratitude by generation
after generation of litterateurs —is quietly pegging
away at his researches in the Record Office,
London, for the Government of N.S.W. As was
only to be expected from a Government which
includes a poet—Parkes !—and an historian—
Suttor!! —and a patron of historians—Carruthers!!!
-"-and a frind of Dimosthenes an’ Diniehy—need-
less to name him ! !!!—the services of the fine old
antiquary are being remunerated at a noble figure.
“ Fifteen bob a-day and find his own paper ” is the
amount !
“General” Booth has no feai’s about a
future state. He knows exactly where he means
to go when the Salvation business doesn’t pan out
any longer in this sphere. Addressing his tur-
bulent “ Army ” at Melbourne the other day, he
grafted the parable of Lot’s wife into the thin
stalk of his remarks, and observed that “ The
Angel’s advice to Lot before the burning of Sodom
‘Fly! save your lives!’ was true Salvation
advice. When he got to heaven he felt he must
hunt that Angel out.” Ask him to come and have
a soda-and-inilk. There’s no pride about the
“ General,”
W. A. Guesdon, formerly of Hobart, who
didn’t leave his son, “Darebin ” Guesdon, a sov.
out of his £300,000, was the first to import the
bronze currency to Tasmania. On receiving £5O-
- with that good-natured eccentricity which
always characterised him, he ad vertised that every
man, woman, and child who called at his auction-
rooms would receive a new penny, halfpenny, and
farthing. In two days he had to shut down on
his offer —people were going half-a-dozen times
over. There is a grim and ghastly reason for
those provisions in Guesdon’s will which exclude
Roman Catholic institutions from benefiting by
his enormous charitable bequests—and the reason
isn’t “ sturdy Protestantism ” either.
Ex-Mayor Gatehouse, of Melbourne, died
on 21st ult., aged 65. He was the rowdiest aider-
man of his time, a “rorty” night-hawk of whom
many lurid stories are told. He was secretly held
responsible on one occasion, when a financial dead-
lock embarrassed the Government, for the sudden
appearance of a gorgeous pawnbroker’s sign
(wrenched from its customary shop-front perch
during the night) bestowed mockingly over the
royal coat-of-arms above the Victorian Treasury
portals. On another occasion a couple of score of
pint and quart-pots were prigged from a hotel,
and next morning, it being the Sabbath, the pious
people wending their way to church via Fitzroy
Gardens were delighted to find all the statues in
that picturesque reserve variously adorned with
these bacchanalian vessels—“ ringed ” on to out-
stretched arms or tied to their necks. It was
Gatehouse’s cheerful habit to go home at 2 a.m.
during his year of Mayoralty on a hot-sausage
cart with a shrieking steam-whistle attachment.
He spent more money in liquor for all hands dur-
ing his official term than any two Australian
Mayors ever did before. One incident of Gate-
house’s career is immortal ; It was he who, in his
civil capacity, placed the citizens’ gold’ laurel
crown upon the noble brow of Madame Ristori.
He put it on so lopsidedly that he made the stately
old dame look as if she had just come off a mid-
night excursion on his special saveloy-machine.
What’s in a name ? Sydney boasts its
publican “Grandfill.”
MacMahon did not receive the support of
the R.C. clergy at the recent Eastßourke election.
I he price of the official R.C. support is nothing less
than a solemn open declaration against the secular
Education Act.
Sydney Echo publishes an article “How
to Rest. The best and shortest way we know of
resting is to borrow the Echo and try to read it.
After once trying this plan, no one ever takes
chloral.
Bishop Reville, of Bendigo, has been ex-
hibiting an alleged morsel of the real Cross'
recently sent along from Rome by His Holiness’
It looks old and respectable, but nobody can
swear to it any more than they could identify s
thighbone of the reviling thief.— J
There is a Ballarat (Vic.) mine which
rejoices in the name of the “Temperance.” The
other day, a “pup” of the same lead had to be
christened, and a number of digger men had
gathered together to negotiate the ceremony
Their fertility of nomenclature was at first it
fault. “Call it the Single Bottle,” suggested
one. “The Local Option,” cried another. “The
Crystal Spring,” gurgled a third. “ Gentlemen ”
shouted the Chairman, with bellowing gravity
“ the claim is next door to the Temperance; there
fore, its name will be ‘ The Consolidated Jimjaim
and D.T. Extended,’ This meeting will now
adjourn for a drink.”
In a N.S.W. cattle district a grazier missed
a pure-bred shorthorn cow. He rode in hot haste
to the homestead of one whose pickle-tub was
likely to be empty. He saw his cow in the stock-
yard amongst beasts belonging to his neighbour
and so overjoyed was he at finding the animal
alive that he went inside for a social glass. On
coming out, he returned to the stockyard. Lo !
the shorthorn cow was missing, and an unidenti-
fiable carcase hung from the slaughtering gallows
He knew it would be folly to complain, so he
returned meekly homewards. But he drove before
him one of his neighbour’s beasts —a fine, red, fat
bullock, with a bell round its neck. Next day
the neighbour visited him and said : “I’ve come
to inquire about a red bullock.” “I shouldn’t
wonder if he’s strayed away with my shorthorn
cow.”_ A pause, and the neighbour spoke thus
with impressive gravity—“ Mind ye, Davie, it’s
no fair o’ ye to keep yon bell.”
One of the tiny blots on the political
reputation of J. G. Francis, once a Premier of
Victoria, and member of McCulloch’s famous
Ministry which broke the back of the Upper
House, and one which he felt deeply in his latest
and most conservative years, was that he had
signed the petition for a revival of transportation
to Tasmania. The sole signatories to that
iniquitous document were landholders, their
merchant - correspondents and dependents, and
the nominees of the official section, and Francis,
then a struggling merchant in Hobart Town’
could not resist the pressure from his sheep-
breeding clients. W. J. T. Clarke, father of
Baronet Clarke, was another signatory, and he
signed as a landholder, oivning 52,000 acres and
leasing 80,000 acres in Tasmania, and owning
40,000 and leasing 62,000 acres in Victoria ! No
wonder old “Alphabetical’’signed in the interests
of ‘ ‘ cheap labour. ” Shepherds were shepherds in
those days, and wire-fences were unknown.
On the 23rd October the first of a series of
great annual sales of Australian wines will beheld
by Messrs. Piggin and Co., of Corowa (N.S.W.),
when 300,000 gallons of the best and purest liquor
in the world will be offered to the nublic. So far,
Australian wine is probably the only unadulterated
drink on earth, and the unfailing security of the
purchaser is that it is so cheap that the elaborate
process of adulteration would be a dead loss.
With the costly alleged vintages of France, Spain,
and Portugal, however, this nefarious mixing pro-
cess does pay, consequently there is about twice
as much of them sold as all the vineyards of
Western Europe can produce. Therefore 50 per
cent, of them may be genuine the other 50 per-
cent. certainly is not. Anybody who wants to
drink cheap and pure wine, instead of expensive
chemicals grown in a city factory or back yard,
should make a note of this and buy the local pro-
duction.
The Sydney Chamber of Commerce yarded
ex-Treasurer M'Millan in a big dreary hall, the
other day, and gave him an illuminated address,
which set forth that the Lord made M‘Millan and
then rested because his work was complete.
There were one or two commercial magnates
present and about a dozen or two small men—men
"'ho owned a one-roomed office apiece, with a
battered table in it, and a fly-blown calendar, and
a directory with a shattered back, and, a seven-
shillings-a-week office-boy, and one dirty window
looking out into a wilderness of broken cart-
wheels and slush. They greeted M'Millan in a
dreary speech that sounded like a spectral dray
with an ungreased wheel going on for ever, and
M‘Millan unrolled his grey-headed platitudes in
response, and cut off a piece, and handed it over.
The following was his peroration:—
There is no social reconstruction that may not be met
by meetings of both parties on a basis of levelling up;
but if there is anything that keeps me in the public life
of this country, and makes me give up leisure, and time,
and family, it is the feeling that in this, as in all com-
munities, there is an element that would destroy the
very Constitution itself—there is an element ripe for
darkness and misrule; but if this community, as I believe
nine-tenths of it is, is true to the great privileges of our
heritage, and true to the Constitution, which is elastic
hut must not be broken, and true to the spirit of the
British Constitution, and true to the instincts of the
British race, this young community will yet evolve the
brighter Britain of the future.
This sort of thing makes us feel very, very old.
Anyhow, we were a young and giddy bachelor
when we started reading M'Millan’s speech, and
it aged us so rapidly that, before we got to the
end of it, our grandson was grown up and had
started a bank, with a capital of £1,000,000 paid-
up, and a reserve-fund of £480,000.
The Theatre Royal Hotel, Sydney, has
lately changed hands, and is now under entirely
new management. A splendid stock of wines,
spirits, liqueurs, and cigars has been laid in, and
an altogether new feature is provided in the shape
of an American bar, where all the strange,
curious, and refreshing drinks known in the
United States can be obtained. Their name is
legion, but among them may be mentioned, cham-
pagne cocktails, gin fizz, milk punch, mint julep—
probably the noblest liquor known to man-
imperial punch, Manhattan cocktails, and many
others. All mixed by American bar-keeps.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Copeland M.P. sighs because N.S.W. has
not as many marriages as the Cabbage Garden.
However, he didn't top-up the latter’s divorces.
And Haynes who trumped his trick by boasting
of the N.S.W. birth-rate, forgot to study the
local illegitimacy statistics.
What is the N.S.W. Treasurer going to do
for money when the £900,000 or so (which is all
that will be available for spending on public
works out of the recent £4,500,000 loan) has been
disbursed ? The time is coming when the fiscal
question must be faced in earnest.
Victorian Government proposes to place
a three-million loan on the London market early
next year. Premier Munro is, however, vexed
that N.S.W. has preliminarily hypnotised the big
tenderers with an alleged 4i-miilions, that really
brings in considerably less than that amount.
• Good old Sir Henry Parkes reproaches the
N.S.W. Assembly with verbosity. Now, the
more men the more talk. Who is the father of
verbosity ? Who gave a million of people a Par-
liament a quarter as numerous as the House of
Commons? Why, good old Sir Henry Parkes.
The London carpenters on strike would be
justified in resisting by \iolence the importation
of foreign labour to fill their places. A foreign-
labour invasion would be more deadly to them
than an influx of armed foreign enemies. The
right to import foreign enemies of the local Work-
man is the logical outcome of Freetrade.
It is cabled that that greasy organ, London
Daily Telegraph, states that Australia is
menaced by Chinese who meditate an invasion.
If Australia hears any more of this kind of Im-
perial bogey-raising she will probably proceed at
The German “nobility” appears to bo
itching for a war.
Political events in Victoria suggest a
possible shunting of Shiels into the Agent-
Generalshp.
J3rown '(—Brown 1 N.S.W, has heard that
name before. Let’s see. When was-it? Amlin
connection with what ?
J. P. Howe owes it to the Bourko
electors to say out loud as their member whether
he is guilty or innocent.
The impecunious members of the N.S. W.
Parliament are enraged because they are now
required to pay “ spot cash ” for all drinks.
S. A. Premier Playford announces that a s
theU.S. blocks Australian wool, South Australh 1 -
will not be officially represented at Chicago World’’'’
Pair.
South Australia is unique for constitutional
changes. The average life of S.A, Governments
U under 12 months. There have been 39 ministries
in 35 years.
S.A. Legislative Council struck out the
word “ Commonwealth ” in the Federation Bill
the idea being that the term threatened the rights
of Property.
The Bulletin prophesies that Dan O’Con-
nor will shortly leave the N.S.W. Government
anyh jw. More than one Minister badly wants to
get rid of him.
Another swashbuckler Gordon wanted in
China— to suppress the same sort of rebellion as
arose when Gordon’s Chinkie friend slew half a
town in cold blood.
S. A Civil Service Commission, when going
through the local telegraph department, found
that one officer was only getting £TCO a year after
twelve years’ service !
“ Supposing the Bill becomes an Act” is
the spirit in which Parkes now talks of his Elec-
toral Pill. Does it show which way the political
wind is likely to blow ?
Sir Henry Parkes devotes a large portion
of his ministerial labours to framing “diplomatic”
answers to Dr. Creed’s searching questions on the
N.S.W. military sham.
What a satire on the N.S.W. Parliament,
which has been reforming the electoral law for
some months, if Traill were to re-introduce his
One-Man-One-Vote Bill !
“Sworn to no Master, of no Sect am I,”
was the motto of the Sydney Morning Herald
—in ttie fifties ; “ Sworn to Mammon, no Politics
have I,” is its watchword to-day.
Railway Commissioner Eddy is understood
to have a commission to belaud the N.S.W. rail-
ways in England, and to do or say anything that
will placate the financial critics of the province.
Chinese are being indented into West
Australia in tidy-sized batches, and, on signing
labour contracts approved of by resident magis-
trates, are permitted to land without payment of
poll-tax !
The Marchioness of Londonderry gave a
ball to the Princess of Wales a few weeks ago, and
the ceiling caught fire, but they went on dancing
in the other part of the room. How symbolic of
the monarchy !
How much less rottenness is there in
N.S.W. Parliament than in the N.S.W. land-
companies? If all things were made plain how
would N.S.W. figure beside Canada in the matter
of corruption ?
Sir Samuel Wilson (absentee) holds by
lease and license 2,714,009 acres of Crown Lands
—including the famous Dunlop estate —for which
he does not pay, on the average, three half-pence per
acre per annum.
At the present rate of progress they’ll
have women in S.A. Parliament ere many years.
The Women’s Franchise Pill passed the local
Legislative Council by one vote, but drops owing
to an absolute majority not having voted.
Fifteen Palmerston (Port Darwin) store-
keepers got up a secret and selfish petition, asking
the members for the N.T. “to remain passive in
the matter of Chinese exclusion, and permit the
existing Act to pass out of existence at the end of
this year.”
Zox, M.L.A., says that Parliament is re-
sponsible for the present state of the Victorian
Railways. And seeing that the white-vested
angel usually cuts his Sunday mutton at the
Chief Commissioner’s table he ought to know all
about it.
All confinees in the prisons and peniten-
tiaries of N.S.W. who are not “under conviction
for any felony or misdemeanour ” have been en-
franchised on the motion of the Government.
And why not ? Every man is innocent until
proved guilty.
AT THE BALL.
SHE: “Now, what age would you really take me for, Mr. Sopht?”
HE: (thinking of something he had seen in the paper): “Why, about 40 I should say. That
is by taking an average. You look like a woman of GO, and talk like a girl
of 20.” [And it was only when she had called him a beast, and had gone off
in a rage, that he remembered that he meant to say the reverse.]
once to run into the sea all the Chinamen that are
now here, Imperial treaties to the contrary not-
withstanding.
The Governors of the Chinese Provinces
assert that the recent anti-European riots “ were
caused by the aggressive attitude of the mission
stations.” The same old story-buccaneers, first;
illicit and over-reaching traders, second; and
Christian missionaries, only as a background of
colouring. Saltpetre, sulphur, and Scripture in
the order named.
The present N.S.W. political situation i s
full of suggestion. The Legislative Council, if it
holds its ground on the Land Bill, will play right
into the hands of the democratic party in the
Assembly. Parkes should be told to “ flood ” the
Council with democratic blood; or to clear out.
As The Bulletin has continually pointed out,
Parkes is playing for a constitutional deadlock.
In two amendments intended to be re-
strictive of the wholesale alienation of land con-
templated by the Queensland Coalition Govern-
ment, Tom ‘Glassey, M.P.* found himself sup-
ported only by—in the first instance, Hoolan and
Salkeld, and in the second, Hoolan solus. He
had previously offered, if backed up by half-a-
dozen others, to stonewall the measure until
■ Doomsday.
Mr. R. B. Wilkinson, M.P. for Balranald,
is reaping the reward of Ids political perfidy in
turning out the last Dibbs Ministry. He has
brought forward two important bills (a railway
and an irrigation bill) in the interests of his
electorate; but the Opposition are deaf to the
claims of Balranald ; and the sooner it dismisses
its scpiatter representative the sooner will its
wants be served.
Old John Sutherland is nob the only
N.S.W. politician who left as .a legacy to his
family the dishonoured paper of a leading person-
age in the province. For when Sir George \Vigram
Allen was gathered home to his fathers, a pile of
promissor y notes was discovered among his papers.
The executors were pained ; the exalted personage
whose signature the paper bore was more than
pained ; he was disgusted with the carelessness of
his deceased banker.
Recently a Victorian politician called upon
Sir Henry Parkes at "the public buildings. The
Prime Minister was seated at his table studying
a sheet of ..foolscap on which was gummed an
excerpt frthSfiN Sydney D.T. The conversation
drifted to the mangling of the Commonwealth
Bill in the Victorian Assembly. “ I never
read the newspapers,” loftily observed Parkes.
“ Apparently not,” courteously retorted the other
nodding at the extract.
Apropos of the suggestion that Gladstone
or Parnell could be elected to the N.S.W.
Assembly under the new Electoral Bill, it may
not be generally known that Earl Grey, Secretary
of State for the Colonies, was elected in 1848 to
represent the city of Melbourne in the N.S.W.
Parliament, by a large majority, over a Mr. T. E.
V. Foster. The law officers reported that the
election was valid, and would, therefore, have to
stand until Earl Grey should notify his resigna-
tion. The seat was declared vacated in 1850, but
the election was never gazetted. The Duke of
Wellington, Lord Palmerston, Lord Brougham,
Lord John Russell, and Sir Robert Peel were
nominated for the representation of Port Phillip
about the same time.
Parkes : “ I have never been a willing
party to taking away any single hair’s breadth of
the power and authority of the responsible minis-
ter.” Wlio appointed the N.S.W. Public Works
Committee? Parkes! The Board of Railway
Commissioners ? Parkes ! The Land Court ?
Parkes ! The Civil Service Commission ? Parkes !
Government Asylums Inquiry Commission ?
Parkes ! And all the other boards and commis-
sions? Great Parkes !
The Parkes Cabinet boasted at the general
election that their political hands were clean.
The Sydney D.T. enthused over this singular
spectacle. It is now backing up Dismal Jimmy
Garvan in his exposing Dan O’Connor’s pur-
chase of a leasehold property from a Member
of Parliament. It is also raking the records
to find some mud to throw at the Post-
master:General. At whose instance is this.dead-
set made against the Jayniel Dan ?
“ It is my ambition, and I assert that it i s
an honourable ambition, to prepare for the tim e
when my sons shall legislate for their nativ°
country,” said Wentworth. Apparently, the son B
of “the first-born of the first generation of
Australians,” as Sir James Martin termed him*
differ in their notions of what constitutes an
honourable ambition from their honoured
sire. What a biting satire upon the old patriot’s
desire to create an hereditary order !
It is rather rough on the warlike news-
paper writers who recently pointed out that the
seizure of Mitylene by Great Britain was
absolutely necessary under the circumstances.
In fact, the events of one week always are rough
on the “ foreign politics” leader writers of the
week previous. Russia and Hingland seem to be
eternally conspiring to make daily journalism
look hopelessly absurd. Take this maxim to heart
and carefully • consider the drivellers how they
drivel.
A deputation representing 20,000 French
workmen waited recently on the Pope, and that
holy father urged them to avoid Socialism, and
trust to “ Christianity and thrift.” Which
reminds us a good deal of that prophet with the
glass eye, 11. H. Champion, and his weary,
hollow, supercilious drawl: “You must —aw —
obey the law—ah—and pwfserve aw-dah.” In
other words, you must let things slide and pray.
But unluckily the men who let things slide and
pray are always left, and the people who trust in
the Lord and wait are left waiting.
Luya, M.L.A., who moves to abolish
payment of members in Queensland, is generally
credited with being a wealthy man. He has in
the past made whips of money at sawmilling and
land-jobbing, still owns valuable areas of
suburban lands, and has been able to build a
costly mansion for himself on a commanding hill-
site in one of the most picturesque spots on the
south side of the river. He personally doesn’t
care about the payment of members; and it is
cheap humbug for him to propose its abolition on
grounds of pretended self-abnegation.
The Australian public don’t care a rap
which side prevails in the flunkoyfied precedence-
contest between the Australian Lieutenant-
Governors and Lord Charles Scott, who claims
that they should pay him the first visit of
ceremony. The Governors and the Lieutenant-
Governors, like the Admiral, are “ the nominees ”
of a practically foreign potentate, and their
appointments are to a great extent the reward of
grovel. As the people have neither voice nor
interest in the selections, they don’t care if these
potentates never pay any visits at all.
“I am no pensioner,” observed Parkes in
the N.S.W. Assembly. But he is very likely to
become a pensioner whenever his Government
falls. The leading men on all sides have been
sounded, and there will be a big majority to vote
him a big pension—or lump sum—-whenever he
gives the wink. However, Parkes will here run a
great risk, inasmuch as it will bo competent for
any member of the House to submit reasons why
such a career as his should not be rewarded with a
pension. And what a blasting indictment could
be drawn against the man !
The recently-deceased James Russell
Lowell’s old sentiments about England ;
T. Macdonald-Paterson, a Bananaland
M.L.C. :
The compulsory registration of letters containing
valuables which exists in Great Britain is a proof that
there is good reason for it.
The existence of a State Church in England “is
a proof that there is good reason for it,” but
Macdonald-Paterson would be hooted and booted
out of Queensland were he to try and introduce
State ecclesiasticism there. Conversely, the fact
that elected English M.’sP. aren’t State paid
should be “a proof that there is no reason for”
such payment; but the Bananaland Parliament
would consume Macdonald-Paterson on a funeral
pyre of his own law-books ere it would acknow-
ledge the justice of his logic.
When the historian of the Federal move-
ment in Australia comes to estimate I uglis Clarke’s
(of Tasmania) position, he will be driven to the
sorrowful reflection that, as in Griffith’s and
Barton’s case, the bias of the special pleader and
the legal advocate who has got to justify the brief,
the whole brief, and nothing but the brief, has
overlain the original patriotic impulse. Even
bucolic Tasmania —which is at about the lowest
tide-mark of political intelligence can’t help
laughing at Clarke’s preposterous contention that
to confer upon the Senate of the proposed Federal
Legislature the power to suggest amendments, is
the same thing as giving it the power to make
amendments. Next to Griffith’s, Inglis Clarke’s
was admittedly the mt st constructive intellect of
the late Convention. May Heaven, then, help
the nation which is dependent upon the brains of
mere special pleaders for the evolution of its
charter of national freedom !
Bavousky : “ Why should marriage turn a
healthy girl into an invalid? ’
“ Oh, God, what a fearful death !” written
with charcoal on a plate, was the only sign given
by a poor devil who stowed himself away on the
steamer Wilcannia bound from London to Mel-
bourne, beneath the furnace and between the
boilers, and was roasted to death ere he could
crawl out.
I tell ye England’s law on sea and land
Hez allers been : I’ve got the heavier hand.
Of all the sarse that I can call to mind,
England does mix the most onpleasant kind ;
It’s you're the sinners allers. She’s the saint;
Wut’s good’s all English, all that’s isn’t ain’t.
She’s praised herself ontil.she fairly thinks
There ain’t no light in heaven when she winks.
She ain’t like other mortals —that’s a fact;
She never stopped the Habus Corpus Act.
She don’t put down rebellions —let’s ’em breed,
An’s allers w illin' Ireland should secede ;
She’s all that’s honest, honnable and fair ;
An’ when the Yirtoos died they made her heir.

In dragging a speech out of Lady Jersey
on every possible occasion the N.S.W. public is
behaving with cruelty. The lady has obviously
not yet recovered from the effects of her severe
English illness, and when on the stump—as at
Manly the other afternoon —shows how keenly her
nerves feel the ordeal.
# # #
Lady Jersey, having seen, or heard, on
reliable authority, of certain alcoholic freaks on
the part of alleged young ladies high in Sydney
society, recently warned those concerned in unmis-
takeable terms. Notwithstanding this, a couple
of society beauties were much-malted at a big and
very fashionable hop the other night. Should
this kind of thing, coupled with midnight step-
dancing in the public streets, make much further
progress in “society,” it will really be time for
the prohibitionist women to have the franchise —
not so much for the purpose of sobering-up the
men as to stop fashionable beauties from elevating
their little fingers.

“ General ” Booth says that in England he
perpetually hears the remark: “We’re going to
send Jim to Australia ; we can’t do anything with
him here.” Well, The Bulletin is on the spot
for the express purpose of preventing Jim coming
to Australia. This country doesn’t want Jim,
nor his father John either. It wants them to stay
“ at home ” and make things hot for the greedy
governing classes.
# # *
The medical men who attended a widely-
known Victorian doctor, recently deceased,
during his last illness, have “billed” the executors
to the aggregate tune of £lOOO odd. The etiquette
of the profession is that no medico charges
another; should a medico’s wife be attended, the
custom is to make a present to the officiating
brother. The executors in this case will not pay,
but leave the debt to the residuary legatees.
A harrowing catastrophe took place the
other night in the dress-circle of the Garrick
Theatre (Sydney)—the sort of catastrophe which
reminds us that all flesh is indeed grass, and all
earthly things are unreliable and transient. The
shoulder-straps of a somewhat decollete lady burst
—both of them exploded at the same moment, in
fact; and as the lady's clothes depended entirely
upon them, it followed that when the gossamer
fabric thus sent in its resignation, her attire began
to slide down rapidly. She was looking hard at
the stage and didn’t seem to notice the disaster.
Other people, however, observed the hurried
escape of her wardrobe—they saw three-fourths
of her back arise gently out of the situation,
and a good portion of her chest ; in fact,
in just about an instant there was hardly anything
of her to be seen except woman, for all the rest
went in one act. The audience grinned, barring a
professor of mathematics who was sitting just
behind the patient. He simply looked at the
undressed apparition with a smileless countenance,
and then picking up her cloak he wrapped her in
it, and she was saved. He did it as coldly as if
he had spent all his life in coming to the rescue of
women whose clothes had fallen off—he didn’t
even seem to take an interest in the job. At the
next interval a blushing lady fled hastily to the
dressing-room, holding up her attire with both
hands as she ran.

A constable, whose official duty is to guard
public buildings in Bridge-street, Sydney, and
take charge of any simpleton who offers' Parkes a
£10-note for a billot, has lost £700 by the failure
of a Sydney^ budding society. He was- teinpted
to invest in bricks and mortar by the
bait of high interest. He is the onpoliceman
who is known not to have locked up his savings
in the proverbial terrace of houses.
A titled lady, who sojourned down South
last summer, is not going there again just yet,
probably because the local folks had a big joke at
her expense. While in Hobart she had some teeth
extracted with the aid of gas, when, as conscious-
ness returned, she heaved a deep sigh and ejacu-
lated, “ Thank goodness it's over —is it a girl or a
boy ?” It was her sister who told, not the dentist.

JohuF. Sheridan kindly treated the old
folks in the Invalid Depot, Hobart, to a “Bridget
O’Brien ” entertainment on Tuesday, Sept. 22.
That day happened to be visiting day with the
clerics of a certain denomination, who also wit-
nessed the performance and appeared to enjoy it
up to dancing-point, but - when the ballet com-
menced they modestly withdrew. However,
shortly after their disappearance attention was
directed to,the peculiar agitation of a window-
blind, and investigation discovered a reverend
gentleman surreptitiously enjoying the show.
Which reminds one of Mark Twain and the can-
can—“ I placed my hands before my face for very
shame. But I looked through my fingers.” A

The Eastern papers lately printed a tele-
gram concerning a horse-whipping case at Fre-
mantle, W.A. The facts appear to be these.
The local magistrate was surprised to find before
him one morning an < xalted member of society, to
wit, a stockbroker who was solid at Government
House. The charge against the broker was horse-
whipping an editor. Indignant at what he con-
sidered a reflection on his honor contained in an
obscure local print he had bought a cowhide and
given the editor “ beans.” Defendant with a smirk
admitted the assault and asked the price. The
magistrate in reply solemnly sent him up for seven
days. So far so good. But now for the sequel. The

upon the Government and asked for the stock-
broker’s immediate release. The Premier read the
deputation—an influential one inflated with scrip
a mild lecture on the difficulty of interfering
with the magistrate’s decision and promised to
see what could be done. Result: prisoner released
next morning.

A lively’ wedding story comes fcfrom Mel-
bourne’s suburbs. The joyful event had arrived
at the refreshment stage, and all seemed bright and
fair, when the bridegroom’s father began to throw
the dejeuner about, and compass the destruction
of his son’s elect with a carving knife, on religious
grounds. Before the old man had time, however,
to fight his way through a lot of bridesmaids and
disorganised relatives of the contracting parties,
he got hemmed in by the crowd, and then the
bridegroom struck down his uplifted arm with a
boiled turkey, or something as hard, so that the
angry parent ultimately stabbed himself, and his
gore spurted forth into the tipsy-cake and things.
The sight of a deep crimson stain upon the blanc-
mange set several maiden aunts shrieking, where-
up n the bride, feeling persuaded that her
husband had been cut down like a flower in the
dawn of his honeymoon, rushed off to the kitchen
and ate a quantity of rough-on-rats, whilst the
best man and several old friends of the family
were fainting in the fender. Then the bride-
groom, finding himself on the verge of becoming
a widower, was with difficulty restrained from
falling off the roof, and the old man, who was
bleeding away in the corner, burst into remorseful
tears and asked to be supplied with a list of the
killed and wounded before he passed away.
Ultimately a change for the better set in all
round. Merciful Providence and a stomach-pump
have done a good deal for the bride, who is in a
fair way to start married life shortly. Also the
bridegroom and other guests are recovering from
the shock. Even the old man has successfully
bound up his wounds, and his bandaged frame
trembles with emotion and gratitude to Heaven
as he thinks of what might have occurred if his
murderous intentions hadn’t been intercepted by
a ham-bone, or whatever it was.

When Labertouche, of the Victorian rail-
ways, was asked whether Sara Bernhardt had a
free pass, he looked scornfully at the questioner
and said, “Certainly not.” Yet he cheerfully
admitted that Johnny Toole was franked over all
the lines in the province. Dull old Johnny, of the
baggy breeches and stale jokes, came under the
“distinguished visitor” clause, but Divine Sara,
the great actress, the real genuine celebrity, of
which Johnny is a bad Dutch-metal imitation—
O, certainly not! But the dead-head system is
not so inconsistent after all. Toole comes a good
deal nearer to the typical distinguished person
than Sara. Toole, you see, is a pal. of Albert
Edward —like the coming Admiral.

Lady Hopetoun’s brother-in-law, Acland
Hood, will stand for West Somerset at the next
llinglish elections. The young man should top
the poll in the Unionist interest. He has a neat
head, with no development where the brains ought
to be, a well-ordtred moustache, small uninterest-
ing features, low narrow brow, and a mild expres-
sionless eye. As a public speaker he chiefly shines
in “ haw !” and his politics are vaguely suspected
to be “ sound.” His coats used to wrinkle across
the shoulders a good deal when in Melbourne, but
a good London tailor will spon put that all right;
and if West Somerset doesn’t roll up with its
chuckle-headed vote for Hopetoun’s retired A.D.C.
we shall be both shocked and astonished.

That dashing white sergeant of the Vic-
torian Army, who mysteriously disappeared on
the eve of his projected marriage with a pub-
keeper’s daughter, and crept ingloriously back to
barracks a week later, is a fine average specimen
of the heroes who play at wanting to do or die.
What says little Miss Gunnion in “The Squire?”:
“ Them soldiers pad their chests to make
girls think their hearts are big—but its all
wa-a-dding ”
A lady-witness, giving evidence at Sydney
sessions last week, stated that the fiist article of
clothing she put on upon a certain occasion was
her spectacles.

The odd thing is that while “orthodox”
newspapers are so fond of asking for Booth’s
balance-sheet, and of wondering what he is doing
with his £lOO,OOO fund, they never show any
curiosity concerning the Archbishop of Canter-
bury’s £lO,OOO a-year, which is mostly expended in
loading up duchesses with early strawberries and
cream. Sauce for the General, but soup for the
“dignified ” clergy.
The influenza is often a dim, mysterious
disease whiclr comes upon public men at oppor-
tune moments. As a rule, too, it spares the piece-
worker, and concentrates its energy upon the civil
servant with a large, regular screw. It is very
little about on the first of the month, but conn s
round again a day or two before the gas-collecior
and prevents the master of the house from drawing
a cheque. At interfering with the payment of
accounts it stands unrivalled in the histc ry of
epidemics.
In Sydney, one day last week, a thin girl
with spectacles, and exceedingly hard of hearing,
was awarded £9OO for breach of promise of
marriage. There were 300 letters in the case, and
the writer of them—a scanty-looking clerk with
fair hair—seemed exceedingly surprised when
the jury—being incited thereto by the amiable
and chivalric Judge Windeyer—thudded down
their verdict. The audience also looked sur-
prised. Possibly the court was aroused to
sympathy, and its inner pathos was stirred by
the plaintiff’s spectacles; anyhow, the lady cer-
tainly got several times as much as the average
girl without spectacles can ever hope for. Juries,
however, are unreliable things at the best, and
regarded as instruments for the assessment of in-
jured feelings they don’t amount to much. The
matter, in fact, wants to be put on a business foot-
ing, and perhaps the shortest way to do this would
be by making each party put up a deposit
and sign articles for the shindy when the
engagement commences. When two pugilists
agree to fight ten rounds the money is always
deposited at the very beginning, and when two
people agree to light off and on for life, the same
course might reasonably be adopted. Then the
individual who fails to come up to the scratch for-
feits the cash, and the other one takes it, and
everything is settled. Or, if this scheme is
unworkable, each man and woman, on reaching a
marriageable age, might be inspected and valued
and duly registered by a Government official
appointed for the purpose. Then any person who
contemplates matrimony could consult the regis-
ter, on payment of the usual fee, and find out
whether he was taking risks with a £5O girl or a
£l2OO one ; and the girl who wants to throw over
some gilded youth could ascertain how much the
gymnastic feat would cost her. In either case the
money would be recoverable by summary proce-
dure. All individuals on the register could be
re-inspected and re-valued every five years, but if
either party had depreciated during the engage-
ment, the other individual should not be allowed
to take advantage of that circumstance, otherwise
there are abundance of mean individuals who
would hang on to a deteriorating girl till she was
re-inspected, and then throw her over on the
cheap. If this scheme doesn’t meet all require-
ments, we would be glad to hear of one that will.

The papers in reporting Miss Mary
MTlwraith’s marriage at Brisbane mention that
the bride carried a tasteful bouquet from the shop
of Mr. —— in Queen-street. Somehow the man
who sells the bride’s vegetable always glares forth
conspicuously in print, and everybody else is left
out. No paper ever mentions, for instance, that
the lady’s female parent was overcome by emotion
and leant up against a wall constructed in a solid
and substantial manner by John Chump, and
afterwards plastered by Patrick O’Brien; nor
does anyone state that her father afterwards fell
down a stair erected by Daniel Brown, and was
consequently confined to a bed manufactured by
the enterprising firm of Smith & Co., furniture
dealers and repairers. It would add a little
variety to the thing also, if somebody would
announce that the bride was supported on the
occasion by her youngest sister, recently spanked
in an efficient manner by that eminent instructor,
Madame Bones, whose academy is so well and
favourably known in the best circles ; but nobody
ever does announce it. The fiend that the bridal
herb was bought from looms every time, and
everybody else is nowhere.

A prominent Southern gaol-official has

to part with certain private moneys and valuables
belonging to prisoners under sentence and placed
in his charge for safe keeping. He kept them so
safely that the poor wretches whose “time was
up'’ often had to leave their temporary abode
with less than they took into it. The little game
was “blown” by a man from whom a silver
bracelet had been taken. Upon demanding his
property at the expiry of his sentence he was
coolly informed by this model prison “banker”
that he had presented the bauble to his wife —

As “Charlie” or “Dave” Barclay goes

11th August, 1891.
To Radam’s Microbe Killer Company.
Dear Sirs, —I have been a great sufferer for over
sixteen years from pains in the legs from the hips
clown to the toes, and also in great misery for
nine years from a kidney disease, during which
time I found I was losing the use of my legs,
particularly the right one, from weakness in the
joints. I tried nearly every known remedy, and
received but little relief until I commenced to use
the MICROBE KILLER.
It is now eight weeks since I commenced its
use, and having used two one-gallon jars, I find
myself an entirely different man. I believe a
little more will entirely cure my complaints, as I
can say that I have not felt so well for eight or
nine years, and can now do my work as well as
ever I could, and also enjoy my meals, which for
many years I could not. —I remain, yours thank-
fully,

It was the death of old Jack Robertson
that killed the Sydney Reform Club. While old
Jack lived there was always hope for that whisky-
fed institution. A few years ago the Club found
itself heavily involved. It was left for Sir Jack
to suggest a remedy. “Let us drink ourselves
out of debt,” said he. And they did. Pretty
nearly every man who ventured inside the Club
was fined a case of champagne. Jack levied toll
on all-comers. Everyone who pleased him had to
shout champagne, and everyone who displeased
him had also to shout champagne. And from the
ukases which proceeded from his throne in the
eastern corner of the general room there was no
appeal.

In other words, Henry can now come home with-
out having the bootjack dashed at his head, and
instead of looking scornfully at the dinner and
then saying “ Damn !” and knocking the meat on
the floor, he consumes the victuals harmoniously ;
also, Annie Eliza has ceased to get hot tea in her
eye unexpectedly. In consequence of which the
cat’s tail, which was much broken and trodden on
in many domestic forays, is healing up again, and
the animal has got kittens; and the small, scared,
red offspring, which used to bolt for the back door
whenever the row started, is calmer now, and
snuffles peacefully, with a large slice of bread and
jam, in the corner. And, taking it all round, an
aspect of calm, domestic bliss pervades the scene,
to which Henry has been so long a stranger that
he feels he must advertise about it.

The W.A. goldfields are being boomed
with a vengeance. A S.M. Herald telegram
announces that on the Murchison “ two men
named Peterkin and M‘Pherson have quite
400 cwt. of solid gold.”
If the letter of an “ influential person ” to
Sydney Morning Herald, placing a value of
£5OO upon some note-books of Oswald Brierly, the
marine painter, who visited the Australias in
H.M.S. Rattlesnake a generation agone, induces
the Government to purchase those same pencil-
hnors, a monstrous job will be effected. They can
possess no antiquarian or historical interest, and
their literary and artistic value is brought to a
very depressed plane indeed, by the circumstance
that if they had been worth publication, they
would have been published. A key to the pro-
posed transaction may be found in the fact that
Brierly was the Queen’s painter, or something.
When the alleged |“ leading journal” of
the mother-colony of the Austi’alias dishes up old-
time incidents, the least that can be expected is
an approximation to accuracy of date, and evi-
dence of a faculty of research of a degree that
would be expected from a school boy competing
for a Carruthers’ prize-essay. The Bulletin
hereby informs the S.M. Herald that the first
dramatic performance in Sydney was not that of
“ The Revenge ” in 1790, but was on the occasion
of the presentment of the comedy of “The Re-
cruiting Officer,” and the tragedy of “The Fair
Penitent,” on 4th June, 1789.

About four more unchartered banks have
burst in Sydney within the last week. Most of
them went very quietly ; they have been so near
the ground for months past that they had only a
short distance to fall. They all went very much
the same way. Somebody whose fixed deposit was
due wanted to get his money back, and despite
the impassioned oration of the curled and oiled
“ teller ” he refused to re-fix the cash for another
three years. Then the teller went and told the
manager, and as there was nothing in the cash-
box but 3s. and a used stamp, the manager also
delivered an eloquent speech to the customer, and
adjured him by the memory of his aged mother
to leave that deposit in. When he wouldn’t do
it, the “board” went out and tried to raise the
money from another bank,.and couldn’t get it.
Then it burst. It would have borrowed the char-
woman’s savings to go on with if it could have
got them, but the charwoman, in many cases, had
been paid in scrip, and hadn’t any money in con-
sequence ; and even the office-boy’s wages were on
fixed deposit; and the butcher had got debentures
for the office cat’s-meat, and there was absolutely
nothing left to borrow anywhere.

History repeats itself. An item from
New York tells of a goldsmith who regularly
played the trick of wearing a well-greased thatch,
fingering gold-dust, and wiping his fingers on his
hair, thus carrying away nightly a good deal of
gold, and who is now in gaol. Old residents will
remember the hirsute bank-manager of a
N.S.W. up-country town, who, when a digger
came to sell gold, used to finger it carelessly, f
and then, with some simple remark, such as,
“It seems very light gold,” would carelessly
place his hands on his head and adopt ]
a thoughtful Napoleonic attitude. Then

he would weigh the digger’s dust, pay for it,
and bow him out. One day, a digger suddenly
returned to ask some question. Not seeing the
manager behind the counter, and the sitting-room
door being open, the digger walked right on and
in. He found Mi'. Manager dusting his head with
his hands, the gold falling in a fine shower upon a
spread-out paper disposed for its reception. That
acquisitive dodger was duly “ sent up.”

Gorgeous male millinery—or, should it be
called “third-sex” millinery?—was one of the
cardinal features of the Anglican General Synod
last week. Primate Saumarez-Smith was dazzling
in pink and scarlet robes cut bias, with puffed
paniers of rissoles and jambon a la Mayonnaise
rampant, with a salad of clerical fixings and
oecumenical feuilles setting forth his ample
physique dla bonbon de fatted-calf. Bishop Goe,
of Melbourne, appeared in cassock, stole and
hood, lightened up with wrinkles couchant and
upper-lip peduncular. The aesthetic Bishop Ken-
nion, of Adelaide, dittoed the dress items, but
contented himself with a smile supine with
aureolar variations. Bishop Montgomery, of
Tasmania, the Antinous of the. Synod, vied
in Cambridge tints with the Primate, with
frillings of shot salad and shell saladin.
The Bishops of Goulburn and of Perth donned
black silk- D.D.’s gowns, with scarlet Hoods,
knock-kneed en train, morticed with interdigita-
tions of pickled swansdown a la agapemone. A
lot of Oxford men wore black and scarlet, variously
decorated with petits pains au caviare, puffed out
fully with whiff - whaffs of cowslip pleats
reticulated with horse-collars jaccnt. No bustles
were detected. Every Bishop had his own
dressing-case cn evidence and plagiedral, with anti-
periodical supports astraddle. The Bulletin’s
man-milliner has offered to swear an affidavit to
the above allegations, which, howevei’, present
such a palpable impress of truth as to render the

Here is an original essayette on Mar-
riage. We do not give the writer’s name, lest
harm befall him. Australia can ill spare so
sprightly a young man :
Those who rail against marriage have either been
jilted or accepted.
Marrying for love is a white elephant. It is sacred, but
it eats its head off.
Marrying for money is an equal blending of avarice and
gold. It is the basest alloy known. Even the supreme
sovereign is only one-twelfth copper,
Love and silver form the combination that emits the
sweetest tone.
Love is to marriage what illness is to death. Those of
a melancholy temperament sicken and succumb most
readily.
Some get married because they think it is the best way
to live. This is like the fasting man—starving himself to
earn his daily bread.
Some get married for a helpmeet. They are like
hbi’ses -they go best when well driven.
To many love is a state of slavery with jealousy as
overseer.
Although many say marriage is a failure, none say
love is.
There is only one thing better or worse than marriage.
That is Death. Yet those on the brink of either cherish
the same hope—the hope of a better future.
A bride is wonderfully like a corpse. She is clothed in
white and “looks happier than she ever did before.”
A scholar-wife is often like a china bull-dog. Only good
for frightening friends.
Don’t marry a political gorgon. She holds on her
course like a tram-car. When you attract most notice,
then you are most like a dog harking in front of it.
The Church view of matrimony is like the keepers’ view
of the bear that was clawing the poor Frankfort woman
to death. Too precious to be interfered with.
Asking the reason why your wife is angry is examining
a blasting charge. It goes off. There is always safety iti
distance.
Those who agree upon everything before marriage
quarrel about nothing after marriage. This is because
love is everything before marriage—nothing after.
Some marry early, some late in life, others not at all.
Whichever you do, either of the remaining two will seem
preferable.
To marry a woman because she is clever is to pal with
the devil.
Marrying in haste is to be a fish. You snap the bait,
and if you get divorce the hook stops in your jaw. Marry-
ing deliberately is much the same thing.
All the difference between marriage and death is about
two per cent. Ninety-eight per cent, marry, one hundred
per cent. die.

Christian Temperance Union, which wants to

saved up for the purchase of millinery and
bassinettes ; his out-of-office-hours energy is to be
devoted solely to the— er—expansion of humanity.

All South Australians remember wealthy,
wicked, dirty, ignorant, old Crowe, whose estate
has been feeding the lawyers for years past. They
may also remember that his daughter—the darling
of ins miserable old heart—was killed by a fall
from her horse, and that when her grieving parent
arrived at the scene of the catastrophe he shook
the corpse once or twice before saying, “ Yes,
she’s as dead as a maggot.” A magnificent
monument, topped by an angel in white marble,
was erected over Miss Crowe in the Robe church-
yard. Dear father “ stood ” £BOO for this work of
art, and he went down one morning with the
monumental mason who had taken the order, to
see what sort of value he was getting for his
money. The one poetical incident in the whole
history of the family comes in right here. The
dead girl had been the only thing at all resembling
an angel that ever smiled upon the old man. And
as he came near to the tall, white-winged figure
over his daughter’s grave, a darned black crow
flew down from the clouds and perched itself upon
the angel’s head—an emblem of the name that the
original had often blushed for. The human Crowe
blew his nose uneasily, and admitted that “It
looked as though the bird had done it for the
purpose.”

Wherever, in the vicinity of Sydney, there
is a particularly dangerous and deadly railway-
crossing, it is an absolutely certain thing that
there is an undertaker’s shop right opposite. The
man of hearses loves to haunt such places, and
when he has erected his death’s-head sign, and put
a baby-coffin in the window, he stands about on
the footpath, ready at any hour to rush out
when somebody is squashed by a ponderous
engine, and measure the remains for their
wooden hide, and take an order for the last
resting place. If the deceased is so utterly
shattered that he can’t be moved except in a
jug then the nearest undertaker is bound to get
the job. And round the corner from that dealer
in deaders and skulls there is generally to be
found a tombstone merchant, who is also waiting
to bolt across and secure the order for the broken
pillar and the partially naked figure to go above
the squashed one’s dust. The presence of these
two persons is a great comfort to the nervous
passenger; when he sees a Baldwin engine bearing
down on him he knows that kind, loving hands
will gather up the wreckage, and measure them
on the spot, and that all will be for the best.

clerk to his superior officer, “ that this address
will be all right ?” “Yes, give him all his titles—
he is touchy about them,” replied the boss. Next
day the letter was returned by the Hon. R. 8.8.,
&c., with a memo, on the turned-down corner :
“Is not the title ‘Esquire’ a surplusage in this
connection ?” As if any title, however common-
place, could have been surplusage in such a “ con-

THE “SALVATION” DRUMMER’S HYMN.
I’m a ’allelujah shouter,
Which I castergates the drum,
And I thump the h’erring doubter
Into blessed Kingdom Come ;
They say our grammer’s ’azy,
And our music’s rather rough,
But I’ll send the devil crazy
If I whack away enough.
O, the General’s a-telling
Of his mishun here below,
While the multitoodes are yelling
And a-swaying to an’ fro :
We are bringing life eternal
To the loafer in the slum,
And that Satan chap infernal
Has to flee before the drum.
Our system of behaving
Seems a bit like “ makin’ game,”
But the souls we keep on saving
Always gets there just the same,
Our “glib and h’uncshus story ”
May be blasfemy to some,
Yet there’s dozens drove to Glory
By the ’allelujah drum.
You seldom find them clerics,
Who are quite the real cheese,
Get the women in hysterics
And the men upon their knees;
Our good effects are fleeting
Very orfen, we allow,
Still the drum is always beating,
And there’s virtue in the row.
Bang, bang ! for our Commander,
And another bang for luck ;
They can chaff, condemn, or slander—
But they can’t deny his pluck ;
He treats the ’ardened sinner
Like a brother and a chum,
Ay, and calls the prigs to dinner
With a thump upon the drum.
There’s a mob of parsons preaching
Holy ’ash that’s awful dry,
All the hearts that they are reaching
You could shove ’em in your eye;
With religion they are messing
And might just as well be dumb,
But we’ve got the Father’s blessing
On the ’allelujah drum.
. See, what a dreadful story’s told,
As bad a tale as one could tell —
That, miners in the search for gold,
Will venture to the Gate of Hell.
Lor, if they find that rush a snide,
We’ll bet a thou., and plank the same,
They’ll bust the Gate and swarm inside.
And jump Old Nick’s prospecting claim.
There’s gold in Heaven, for ain’t we told,
In language which should hearts compel,
That all its streets are paved with gold ?
And now we’re told there’s gold in Hell.
In Earth, Heav’n, Hell, it seems they use it,
This bait for passions homicidal ;
Well—so—if God, man, devils, choose it,
Then gold should be a worthy idol.

T IS INCONVENIENT,
UNPROFITABLE,
AND PARTICULARLY FOOLISH
To buy rubbish of any sort. If the best article of
its class cannot be obtained in one place it can in
another, and it is always bad policy to be bluffed
into buying the second best of anything, just for
the sake of effecting a temporary saving of either
tune or money. For the saving
and regrets, like curses, come home to roost.
This advice has a good, all round, general ap-
plication, but it is rarely heeded because it is so
cheap and common. The foolish housewife
listens to it and smiles, but vaunteth to herself
meanwhile her superior wisdom, -while the wise one
closes one eye in silent meditation, and scores a
notch upon the handle of the broom or the head
of her nearest offspring, whereby she may after-
wards refresh her memory
In no sense is this well-seasoned hint of so much
value as in its application to the purchase of oil
for domestic use, and in the best interests of every
consumer this should be cut out and pasted in the
hat of the head of every household. Never buy
inferior oil until you have discovered an insurance
company that will
And even then it would be an unwise thing to do,
because as the time, place, and probabilities of
the risk are uncertain, the premium must be
abnormally high. Higher even than the wreckage
might be expected to go, and the contemplation
of that alone should be sufficient to impress the
merits of Luxene, the new illuminant, on the
minds of all Christian peoples.
LUXENE HAS NO SMELL,
GIVES A BEAUTIFUL LIGHT,
IS VERY ECONOMICAL,
AND UNQUESTIONABLY SAFE.
Try it, and be for ever grateful for the advice,
which is as disinterested as it is sound.

LOST TREASURE.
Mr. Win. Morgan, Chairman of the Pukekohe
(N.Z.)East Highway Board, writes as follows:
“ During harvesting operations in January last
one of my boys had the misfortune to lose his
Waterbary, but where he had no idea. He
searched the paddock, but could not discover the
lost treasure. A few days ago, however, one of
our neighbours picked it up, wound it, and it
started to go at once, although it had been lying
on the ground exposed to the weather for two
months. Surely such a fact is worthy of record
for the popular Waterbury.”

Miss Griffiths (Eng.), who successfully

KEEP IT FOR REFERENCE
The following suggestions are not designed to
induce the public to attempt the duties of the
regular surgeon, but merely to place the reader in
possession of a means of treatment of the minor
accidents occurring daily in the household. No
family can be assured against accidents; the
broken bone, tiie dislocated joint, the severed
artery, these are misfortunes that may possibly
happen to anyone; and we scarcely need to add
that they demand the instant attention of the
most skilful surgeon within reach. But by house-
hold accidents we mean those which are constantly
occurring every day, in nearly every family, and
which, while not always dangerous in themselves,
are exceedingly annoying. Burns, bruises, cuts,
scalds, sprains, &c., are principal among these
troublesome and annoying occurrences, and
demand immediate treatment with the best means
at hand. In the kitchen, the dining hall, the
nursery, and the sitting room they are liable to
happen, and instead of fear and alarm at the
sight of the cut or smashed finger, or burned or
bruised arm, or scalded surface, a cool and quiet
manner should be assumed, and after washing
away the blood (if required), the injured parts
should be dressed with that most valuable remedy
~St. Jacobs Oil. Its especial worth for the
injuries named, and others of a similar nature, is
not based upon mere claim and assertion ; but its
constant use for a long term of years has given it a
reputation which is alwa3's increasing. Its sur-
prisingly quick relief, its cleansing properties, its
tendency to quickly remove all inflammation, and
its wonderful efficacy in the above, as well as in
all muscular and other pains, such as rheumatism,
neuralgia, toothache, headache, stiffness of the
limbs, joints, &c., these qualities render St. Jacobs
Od pre-eminently the best external remedy before
the people, which claim is fully substantiated by
the class of strong testimony voluntarily accorded
it by representatives of every class and station in
life.

“ Since I used (he Electric
Hair Curler my hair has
gained in strength and lustre,
and crimps and curls as if by
magic lam determined that
all my friends shall use it.'
Unsolicited testimonials, couched in the most eulogistic terms, have been
: received from all parts of the world by the inventor of this ingenious, time-saving,
and altogether admirable piece of mechanism.
By its aid the hair, beard, or moustache can be curled in any style in two
; minutes. It produces any form desired by ladies wearing their hair in the fashion-
able “ loose and fluffy ” mode. A beautiful article; handle of rosewood, other
part nickel-plated.
Entirely harmless to the hair. Saves time and trouble, and never fails to
curl or crimp in the most graceful, beautiful, and artistic style.
Ladies who wear crimps, or other forms of false hair, will find the Electric
Curler an article of the greatest utility. It is simple in its operation, and can be
used by everybody with entire success the first time. It has become indispensable,
and within a short time almost universally adopted by the ladies of England and
America.
Can now be obtained
through all Chemists and Per-
fumers, <fec., in the Colonies.

round. Ben Gaunt was the longest Englishman who ever
got into the ring, and when lie fought Bendigo the latter
was too smart for the long ’un, and would land a stinger
and drop immediately on his knees. This so infuriated
the giant that, upon Bendigo landing an extra hard one
and dropping tauntingly, Gaunt could not contain himself,
hut boxed Bendigo's ears, thus losing on a foul.

There are some men in the N.S.W. Parliament
now who were “no mugs with their hands” in bygone
days. “Jim” Garvan was no pick-up with the gloves,
and few men on the Castlereagh or the Barwon could take
a fall out of George Cass. Gedrge always carried a bit too
much beef, and qsed to go in and try to smash his man up
while his wind lasted, his whirlwind act usually coming
to a successful conclusion. One of George’s hardest mills
was at a town on the Namoi when he knocked out a noted
bully in short order by the light of three tallow candles,
held respectively by the police-magistrate and two Jus-
tices of the Peace.

Goldsborough and Marvellous head the list of
winning sires for the season, from August Ist, 1890, to
31st July, 1891, with a total of 28 each, Grandmaster
following closely with 26. In re value of stakes, Musket
comes out ahead by the help of ids wounderful son
Carbine, his stock having won in stakes over £17,500.

Although Dr. Carver was unsuccessful in the
recent match with Mr. L. Clarke, it was not bad shooting
on his part that lost him the match, as, out of his hun-
dred birds, he only actually missed one, several badly-hit
birds just managing to get out of bounds. The Doctor
was in great form at Lady Robinson’s Beach the other
day, when he accounted for 51 birds (regular hummers)
out of 52.

As The Bulletin has often pointed out of late
years, the only chance for the Hawkeshury Race Club is
their obtaining the privilege of holding their future
meetings prior to the Randwick gathering, as under the
present state of things the old institution is in a rapid
decline. In former days there used to be heavy betting
on the events weeks before, but now scarcely a wager is
hooked prior to the day of the race. This year the pre-
sence of H. Oxenham’s gelding Hero in the County Purse
a* the handy weight of 7st. 91b., including penalty,
reduced the field to eight starters, and there can be no
gainsaying the fact that a worse field never faced the flag
in the event. Hero certainly did not run up to his recent
Randwick form, but the course was exceptionally heavy
and not suited to h's long, striding style of going.

Long Jim Hall, the Australian middleweight, is
probably the most scientific man—bar Peter Jackson-
Australia has yet turned out. In Chicago, before some
300 people, Hall and Corbett boxed four rounds, when
Hall showed vast superiority over his opponent. Mr.
Steve O’Donnell, the Sydney atnateur, a pupil of Peter
Jackson, is a boxing wonder, and the writer doubts if
anyone living could give him a start for four scientific
rounds

John Roberts will require to show them all he

Mick Ives’ mill with Jim Barron, at Sydney
Gymnastic Club, was most disappointing. Ives appa-
rently showed the white feather and went out in the
eighth round. And yet he had previously been seen to
advantage with the gloves, and in several turns-up with
the knuckles had proved himself of good material. How-
ever, he did not seem in good condition on the occasion.
Whatever the cause, the splendidly-built little fellow will
find it easier to gain the reputation of a “ cocktail ” than
to lose it.

There is a story told of two horses trained at
Newmarket, of such equal merit that when they were
ridden by two lads of the same weight, they invariably
ran a dead heat, but if one of the boys carried the key of
the stable in his pocket, his opponent’s horse won by a
short head. Next !

There nearly eventuated a riot at one of the
Sydney pedestrian grounds, a few nights ago, in connec-
tion with the running of a professional handicap. In the
final heat the favourite, who went out at two to one on,
appeared to win comfortably by half-a-yard, but to the
dismay of his backers the judge decided against him.
There was some talk afterwards of matching the pair to
run for £5O from the same marks, but when it came to
staking the money the backers of the man who had
received the stakes declined to “ plank.”

Poor H. H. Simpson, the fine young American

There was an excited “Nap” party the other
evening in the Adelaide express. They numbered eight
altogether; they were playing a shilling game, and at
last there was a treble-header on and a big pool. Just
then the train stopped, and one of the players—a stolid
old man with a cold, hard eye-went out to get a hurried
drink. While he was away the others put up a base
deception upon him with a view to taking him in. They
dealt him a hand consisting of ace, king, queen, knave,
and nine, and gave another player a hand consisting of
the ten, six, four, three, and deuce. Then they smiled
softly as they thought how the old veteran with the cold,
hard eye would be inflamed at the sight of his hand, and
how he would go “nap” wildly and tumultuously, being
goaded on by the thought of the big pool, and then how
he would fall with a crash and a curse on the last card and
sit swearing among the debris of his shattered fortunes,
while they collected from him 15s. each. They were still
thinking of these things and getting cramps through
smothered laughter when the ancient one came back and
picked up his cards. Then with a dull and fish-like ex-
pression of utter unconcern he went four, and took from
them 12s. each, and the faces of the company fell so
violently that they nearly fell off altogether, and the
event cast a gloom over the entire journey,

quantities of Automatic Reed Organs, Organettes, &c., it has ever been our aim to produce at a low Price an Organette capable
of a VARIETY of TONES, the Organettes heretofore placed before the Public having but a limited compass, and but one range
of tone. While we have given universal
satisfaction, we still have had as our
motto, “Excelsior," and now can exclaim,
“Eureka!” because, without increasing
the price of the Orchestral Organette
(our latest production) over other
instruments in the market, we have
succeeded in producing the very ACME
OF MUSICAL INVENTION, an instru-
ment with as much variety of tone as an
organ costing £25. The illustration gives
you but a faint idea of general make and
finish, but every Orchestral Organette is
supplied with 28 FULL SIZED
AMERICAN ORGAN REEDS, the same
size and quality as those used in a cabinet
organ. The reeds are placed in a novel
manner over a double suction bellows,
and are controlled by THREE STOPS,
as follows, viz., Flute, Expression and
Vox Humana. The music is produced by
perforated sheets, which pass around the
Organette in endless bands, enabling
a tune to be played over and over
again without stopping, furnishing
the GRANDEST ORCHESTRAL
EFFECTS, either in sacred, secular,
dance, or vocal music, affording a rich,
sonorous, and powerful accompaniment
to the voice, requiring absolutely no skill
in the performer, and THE RANGE OF
MUSIC AND TONE IS PRACTICALLY
UNLIMITED. By the manipulation of
the stops, a tone as soft and sweet as a
zephyr, or a loud, long and swelling
melody may be produced; trills and high
falsetto, as well as reverberating bass,
and all manner of pleasing combinations
at the will of the performer.
We wish to introduce one of these
Orchestral Organettes into every town
and village in Australasia. We caution
you against the many worthless auto-
matic instruments being sold under
various names. We are the SOLE
PROPRIETORS of the ORCHESTRAL
ORGANETTE, and you must order
direct from us or through our authorized
agents. Remember, the Orchestral
Organette is a LARGE and POWERFUL INSTRUMENT, built exactly on the principle of CHURCH ORGANS; they are
made in the most substantial manner, highly polished and decorated in gold. The reeds are the product of machinery costing
thousands of pounds, and are so powerful they produce srig uent volume of music for the drawing-room, chapel, lodge, or ball-
room. There is nothing about them to get out of order. Tney positively improve with age, producing richer and sweeter tones
after having been used a few years. For HOME ENTERTAINMENTS THEY ARE UNSURPASSED. Bear in mind that
each instrument has FOURTEEN MORE REEDS than any other Organette in the world and they are ORGAN REEDS, and
the special feature is THREE STOPS, a characteristic of no instrument except a costly organ. Our regular price for the
Orchestral Organette is Five Pounds. Having just put it before the public, we will sell a limited number to the readers of this
paper at £3, Carriage Paid to Any Address in Australasia, UNTIL DECEMBER 26th, 1891, provided the attached Coupon is cut
out and sent with order not later than that date, and we furthermore agree to REFUND THE MONEY and PAY
CARRIAGE to any one not entirely satisfied after receiving it. By the aid of the Stops, viz.. Expression, Flute and Vox
Humana, there is not a piece of music which cannot bo played with all the varying effects of an orchestra; a false note is an
impossibility, and the most difficult operatic air is played with as much ease as the most simple hymn. In many homes will be
found a Grand Piano or Organ, with not an inmate of the household, even the most expert player, who can interest company on
either so well as a child of three years old can on the ORCHESTRAL ORGANETTE. Remember, any tune can be played with
artistic effect by any one, young or old. You can play DANCE. SACRED, or SENTIMENTAL MUSIC with as much effect as
that produced by a FIRST-CLASS FOUR PIECE ORCHESTRA. Remember, our regular price is £5, but as we have found a
well pleased customer our best advertising medium, have decided to sell a limited number, as an introduction to the readers of
this paper, at £3, carriage paid, provided tire order is received not later than December 25th. 1891, and we will give a selection of
MUSIC FREE with each Instrument. Send mone.y and Coupon by Registered Letter, Crossed Cheque, or Money Order to

A N.S. W. clergyman states that out of
117 marriages officiated at by him last year 20
were celebrated at or near midnight.
Some years ago, Phil. Garland, a well-
known North Queenslander, had the luck to find
an aboriginal mummy forked in a tree after the
autocthonal fashion. He annexed it, of course,
and was conveying it into Cairns. He camped
one night at Alley’s, which was then a tent only.
At this very time Sam Griffith and the late Billy
Miles were making from Herberton to Cairns, and
they also got belated at Alley’s. Alley roused out
Phil., who was a Griffithite at that period, and
readily turned out to oblige the Liberal leaders,
but thoughtlessly left his precious mummy on one
of the stretchers. At sparrow-chirp next morning
Phil, suddenly thought of his deceased. Entering
the tent without ceremony, he asked Sam if he
had noticed a corpse kicking around. Billy Miles
rushed out of the tent at once ; Griffith only sat
up and asked, as if in cross-examination—“What
corpse ?” “My corpse,” quoth Phih —“ a corpse
of high degree. . . Ah ! here it is, I see you’ve
been using it as a pillow,” “But what is it?”
“ A blackfellow’s mummy I found, and I mean to
sell it to some Museum or other.” “ I thought I
smelt something of very high degree,” murmured
Samuel, “but put it down to malarial emanations
from the soil,”

The Argus “ social gossip ”-er sends a
cock-and-bull yarn concerning blackmail levied
upon London managers by critics, and “leaders
of the ‘ educated pit,’” who plant original trage-
dies and comedies upon the boss and expect him
to buy them right out. A stupider lie never got
into a Tory publication. Influential critics may
occasionally rush a manager into paying for a play
he doesn’t require, or dream of producing, but the
suggestion that “almost every critic” sends in
these dummy plays “with the regularity of the
rate papers,” is hare-brained bosh. Yet it has
more colour of possibility than the story that
certain imaginary educated pittites “have it in
their power by organising a sort of first-night riot
to paralyse the powers of the players, and thus
bring about a fiasco.” Eirst-night riot—first-night
rot! The man writes as though he doesn’t know
that Australia is about one-third full of ex-London
theatre-goers, many of them quite modern. These
latter are perfectly well aware of what would
happen to the “leaders ”—ye gods !—who started
a sort of riot in the pit (of all places) in order to
spoil an interesting show. Why, the others would
knock the leaders silly and then sit on them so as
to get a better view. There is but one rational
explanation of the Argus man’s yarn. No doubt
he once had a ghastly play of his own produced
for a single consecutive matinee, and the pit gave
it slops. That’s what’s the matter with Jacob.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
!%
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuxi-
CURA Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, Cuticura Soap is simply incom
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure,.delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.

Dear Bulletin, —That you, above all,
should lend your breath to puff that bladder,
A. Patchett Martin, a degree or two bigger !
Why don’t you prick it once and for all? That
Murray’s Magazine article on Gordon was a
mere rechauffe, of poor Tenison Woods’ Victorian
Review “ Notes,” Sutherland’s contributions to
Argus, Australasian and Melbourne Review,
and Hewlett Ross’ pretentious and inaccurate
bit of book-making, “ The Poet of the Centaurs”
—how did this fact escape you? In your par.
you attach to Martin the merit —poor, perhaps,
but still a merit—of unearthing original communi-
cations as to Gordon’s Australian career. Nothing
of the sort—nothing can be more remote, ap-
parently, from Martin’s method of work than
personal research or enquiry. His paper is
diluted Woods, tinctured by Sutherland and Ross
—the work of which last was wiped out of the
category of trustworthy biographical data by half-
a-dozen lines from Gordon’s widow—now Mrs.
Peter Low. There is absolutely nothing original
in it except its blunders—-a characteristic that
prpves its kinship to the Temple Bar article of
seven years ago which was the vehicle chosen by
the author of “Fernshaw,” to introduce himself
and Gordon—don’t alter the order of the words—
to English readers. The Temple Bar screed was
illumined by the wonderful discovery by Martin
of tiie “hitherto unpublished” MS. of “The
Exile’s Farewell,” a peerless triumph of research
and industry which was only slightly discounted
by the fact that these particular verses are to be
found in the small and rare volume of Gordon’s
Poems, published at Mount Gam bier, S.A.,
twenty-odd years before! Of course, Martin
never heard of the Mount Gambier issue, and in
this respect he is not singular among the poet’s
critics and biographers. Not one in fifty of ’em
has heard of it. But —in presence of this simple
fact —what a farce it is that these parasites of our
growing Australian literatui'e should be permitted
to float in the irridescenoe diffused by a strong
writer’s fame ! And, O Heavens ! to think that it
is A. Patchett Martin who guides Literary
Opinion ! The noble function performed erst-

“ Bhei ney ”is defined in a new American
dictionary (run by an Irishman) as a “shrewd

an Irishman.”
The look-out man on the Gambler at th e

approaching smash would furnish some good

A certain wealthy Gwydir district, N.S. W.,
squatter has his sheep mustered by blacks, and
shorn by Chinese. There are 40 stands in the
shed, but the squatter keeps about 70 Chinkies on
hand, allowing a 75 per cent, surplus for deaths,
desertions, opium - trances and lepers. The
Pastoralists’ Association, in the first flush of the
new Conference compromise with the Shearers’
Union, has repudiated the squatter and expelled
him from the shade of its umbrella. This may be
fairly classed as a fresh shearers’ triumph.
Dear Bulletin, —Your paragraph upon
the humours of the Australian sub-contract might
lead people to believe that wages-men slipped up
by a levanting sub-contractor are without a
remedy in all the provinces. It may be useful to
point out that, by the N.S.W. Contractors’ Debts
Act, 1879, a contractor sub-letting any part of his
work is responsible to the extent of two months’
pay for the wages of the workman employed by
the sub-contractor, and a workman employed by
a sub contractor may proceed under the Act
against the contractor as if he had been directly
employed by him. The amending Act of 1888
extends this remedy to the case of persons wl o
have supplied material to the sub-contractor.—
Yours, Unionist.

Let it be distinctly understood that this is no
scheme of quackery to draw money out of the
afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent medicine
humbug, since there is not a grain of medicine of any
kind required in the treatment. Notwithstanding
this fact, it takes directly hold of the worst cases
of constipation, dyspepsia, liver complaints, head-
aches, heart disease, incipient consumption,
diabetes, and Bright’s disease of the kidneys, in-
cluding fevers and inflammation of the lungs, and
of other internal organs—not by attacking these
so-called diseases directly, but by radically neutra-
lising and removing their causes, thus alloiving
nature herself to do her work unimveded.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation without the least danger to the most
delicate constitution, that there is not a form of
disease that flesh is heir to, which will not be
affected favorably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of treatment.
In selling this Pamphlet we are obliged to re-
require a “Pledge of Honor” from those purchas-
ffig it, not to show or reveal its contents outside
°f their own families. This is for our own protec-
tion, and as the only means by which our just
fights in the discovery can be ma ntained.
Doctors, of course, who purchase are not debarred
from using the treatment in their own practice,
providing they do not show the pamphlet or do not
reveal the rationale of the treatment.
The Australian Temperance World says;—“We can
thoroughly recommend it as a genuine treatment that
must benefit most all disorders. It requires no outlay
after purchasing the pampnlet. It is based upon
thoroughly hygienic principles, and we believe every
thorough user must receive benefit. One great considera-
tion with ladies will be that it secures a clear skin and
speedily does away with a muddy complexion, and
removes all eruptions arising from diseased conditions of
the blood. We have made ourselves familiar with the
pamphlet, and heartily endorse it.”
Presbyterian, of July 4, says:—“We have seen the
pamphlet, and can thoroughly recommend its rationale.”
The Freeman’s Journal says:—“ After a careful perusal
of the pamphlet we have no hesitancy in recommending
the treatment which Dr. Hall discovered.”
The Sydney Mail says:—“ We have seen the pamphlet,
and, although we cannot reveal its secrets, we can bear
testimony to the bona-fides of the advertisement.”
Martin’s Home and Farm says:—“ We can recommend
it as a genuine thing.”
The Aultralian Star says:—“lt is thoroughly purify-
ing. hygienic, and rational in the highest degree.”
Truth says; —“ It is beyond a doubt all that is claimed
for it.”
Sunday Times says“ It will, we believe, where cure
is not possible, assist in alleviating ; and to folks suffering
from habitual constipation, indigestion, deficient cir-
culation, and poorness of blood, it cannot fail to be of
benefit.”
Brisbane Evening Observer says A feature of the
treatment is that it requires no extra expense after the
first cost of the pamphlet, and can be applied as easily in
the bush as in the city.”
The Echo, Bulletin, and other leading papers speak in
similar unqualified terms.
Australian Independent says:— “To suffering humanity
we regard the discovery as a wonderful boon,”
The following testimonials from ministers, doctors, and private persons speak for them-
selves and they are but a drop in the bucket of the thousands received :
DR. R. F. STEVENS’ INDORSEMENT.

physical structure a greater degree of solidity, or, in
other words, a higher specific gravity than that possessed
by any other man living. I learn that he has persistently
continued the treatment to the present time-forty years
in all-and that his present health and vigorous condition
may rightfully be compared to the ‘bloom of youth,*
though he is nearly seventy years of age. The tests I
have made of the treatment upon myself and in my prac-
tice in the twenty years past, have convinced me that
great practical benefit may be derived by members of the
medical profession and others from a careful study of the
rationale of the treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall, the
details of which he proposes to give in his forthcoming
book. A debt of gratitude will surely be due to him for
whatever scientific advances he may be able to unfold in
the line of assisting nature to ward off disease, and in the
restoration of health.-R. F. Stevens, M.D.”

use of Dr. A. W. Hall’s treatment for about two months
I find myself entirely cured of that very painful com-

“ Mr J. C. Oakman, 8 O Gonnell-street, Sydney.-Dear
Sir—Yours of July 14 to hand. Thank you very much
for’your kind offer, to help me in case I could not under-
stand thoroughly the pamphlet or if 1 found difficulty in
applying the Irealmont. It is not the case. I understand
Enghsh'as well as French, and as for the treatment it has
already done a world of good, and the pamphlet is worth
hundred times the money. If it had been translated in
French I would have advised some friends a|id
relations at homo to buy it. This is the
reason why I was asking, and I hope it will'soon
ho translated in every known language and spretad
all over the world. I have been suffering from dyspopita
for the last 20 years, and a few days of this treatment
has done me more good and given me more relief than
all the remedies I ever tried before.—l am, dear sir, yours
faithfully, Jude Derbrxy.”
The distinguished pulpit-orator and evangelist,
Rev. Miles Grant, Boston, Mass., writes,
October 7 :
“ ***Touching your wonderful discovery, I take much
pleasure in saying I am delighted with its effects upon
my system. 1 sent for it that I might know its influence
on a healthy person. I have now’ used it about three
months, and intend to continue its use during my mortal
life. The treatment produces a general refreshing, in-
vigorating effect: sharpens my appetite, sweetens my
sleep, and makes me feel as though I had a new lease of
life. I have persuaded several of my brethren of the
ministry to send for your Health-Pamphlet, and so far as
I have heard from them they are exceedingly pleased.
One of them said to me a few days ago, ‘ I would not
take $5O for it. It knocks the bottom out of disease.’ I
can say for myself I never spent cash to better advantage
than when I bought your pamphlet —Your brother in
Christ, Miles Grant.”
“ Sydney, June 3, 1891.
“ Mr. Oakman.—Dear Sir,—l have now used for one
month the treatment described in Dr. A. W. Hall’s
health pamphlet, and I certainly feel a wonderful
improvement in health, so great that 1 cannot describe
how very different my feelings are, for life is now enjoy-
able ; but for nine years past it has often been very
miserable. In the head I have suffered dreadfully, owing
to softening of the brain, and often partial temporary
paralysis of tongue, and other parts; also frequent
severe pains at the heart, with less and less capacity for
work, and other troubles, all of w’hich have ceased to
trouble me except a slight occasional reminder at the
heart. lam exceedingly thankful to the Almighty, and
to Dr. Hall, and yourself, that I am so well, for a month
ago I felt as if some dreadful climax was near.—Yours

“J. C. Oakman. Dear Sir,—l have very much pleasure in
testifyingto the efficiency of Dr. Hall’s hygienic treatment.
I have been a sufferer from indigestion and constipation
in its worst forms for the last eight years, and during
that time I have consulted four (4) medical practitioners
of great skill, but have received very little relief. I have
used a terrible lot of pills and patent medicines. At first
they used to give me a certain amount of relief, but for
six months before using Dr. Hall’s remedy they were quite
useless. For three months before using the hygienic
treatment I suffered terrible pain in my stomach and
bowels, especially at night. I could not sleep but very
little, and had frightful dreams. Mrs. MTnnes had to put
mustard plasters and hot flannels across my stomach
before I could get any relief. I have been using the
hygienic treatment for five weeks, and thank God it has
given me great relief. Since I have started to use it I
have not felt any pain, and can sleep quite sound every
night. I have not felt tltyj slightest touch of indigestion
since, and can eat three hearty, good meals every day.
Everybody says how well I begin to look. My wife and
daughter also'use it with good results. I have not the
slightest doubt but that it wull cure diseases of the
stomach, liver, kidney, and bowels.—Faithfully yours,

Tales of Old Sydney.
No. XII.—“ The Hanging of the Eight.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A July sun parted feebly and sullenly the
sombre clouds which dropped a drizzle upon the
town; and the Reverend Mr. Cowper and the
Reverend Father Therry, meeting at the lumber-
yard gate, shook hands in a manner that showed
their susceptibility to the depressing influences of
the atmospheric gloom.
“A miserable day, Father ! ” was the Church of
England Chaplain’s salutation. “But not in-
appropriate to the, ah—the event.”
“Well, Mr. Cowper, I must say that for the poor
ifellows inside I would have preferred a brighter
■sunshine. If men like ourselves yield readily in
temper and mood to the character of the day,
what wonder is it that those poor half-brutes
■■should be still more impressed by damp and
igloom, or exhilarated by warmth and sunshine.”
“None, indeed ! ” sighed Mr. Cowper. “ They
are, indeed, little more than animals, and as such
love to bask in the sunshine and shrink from wet
and darkness. How are yours ? ”
“Ah, poor boys, they were in a bad way when
I left ’em yester eve. And that Moore callant —
any heart bleeds for him—l believe he is inno-
>cent ! ”
“ You really think so, Father—how awful if it
should so prove later. You’ve seen the Governor,
■of course ? ”
“Yes, but it’s the old story, he said. There
ns never a sessions which leaves a string of con-
■demned but what I have the same tale to tell, and
Teally he would beg leave to be excused this time,
‘having already reprieved fourteen, from extending
'the prerogative to another soul of this batch.”
“ But why should he not have reprieved Moore,
if there are doubts ?”
“In the first place, the doubts have no legal
value. Doubts are not proofs, and, in the second
place ” The priest lowered his head to
whisper into the other ecclesiastic’s ear.
The Reverend Mr. Cowper started back.
“ Lot!” he ejaculated, the sharp note expressive
of horror giving the key to his intonation.
“Lot! I thought all such practices had been
(abandoned!”
Father Therry had lifted his cane to beat
the wicket. Now, he re-lifted it. The
action was simple enough, but there was some-
thing in the gesture suggestive of accusation and
-denunciation. It was as though he was hurling
an anathema against the Evil Powers. Perhaps
die was.
“ Abandoned ! So did I! But I know this for
iafaet. I was waiting to see the secretary in the
ante-room, which is the next room to the clerks’.
They did not know I was there —and they went
»on in their devilish game !”
“ Father !”
“ On my oath, as a priest, Cowper, it was so!
fßut, perhaps, it’s the word ‘devilish ’ you object
cto? Isn’t the tiring devilish, and shouldn’t the
,proper word be used for the thing ?”
“ The thing is—devilish !” assented the scarcely
iless-heroic but much less fiery Protestant Chap-
Hain. “ But I could not conceive that such things
were still done ! In the olden days I knew they
were, but now !”
They’ll always be done, Cowper. I
Tdlßyou, while the men at home deal with men’s
lives with Jess thought .than they give to their
dogs and horses—while they think a head of game
is worth more than ah immortal soul* and a human
life of less value than a few pence worth of pro-
perty. Done ! It was done on Friday ! It will
be done for many Fridays yet!”
The wicket in the huge gates now swung open,
and the two clergymen, divided by unbridgeable
differences of faith, but alike in largeness of heart
and purity of conduct, went in to administer the
last consolations of their respective creeds to the
Condemned.
For this morning was that of an Execution
Monday, and Eight had been left, and fourteen
had been withdrawn by the vice-regal mercy in
conjunction with the turn of the dice-box.
# # *
Twenty-two criminals, without, as it hap-
pened, including a solitary murderer in their
number, had been cast for death at the last
sessions of the Supreme Court. And fourteen
had been reprieved.
On what principle the reprieve had been granted
no one, unless it was the Governor himself and
the Colonial Secretary, and the Judge who had
passed the sentences, knew. At least, that was
the popular, the general, impression. As a matter
of unambiguous fact, it is exceedingly improbable,
however, that even the three great men just
referred to were any more precisely informed than
the unpotential mob outside official circles. If it
had been possible to put such august personages
into the witness-box, the only answer that could
have been obtained would, to a certainty, have
been that no principle at all had guided the vice-
regal hand in “pricking the remissions.” Pure
chance ruled the game, and, as men’s lives were
the stakes, perhaps Father Therry’s epithet of
devilish was not altogether misapplied.
Fourteen were taken and the Eight were left;
and this is the manner of the taking.
* * *
Judge’s report, sir !” greeted the Colonial
Secretary, as he called in his Under-Secretary.
“Sessions closed, then? How many capital?”
questioned the great man.
“Twenty-two, sir, and five death-recorded.”
“ That all ? Then we’ll not require an extraor-
dinary Council. The regular meeting will do.
Make usual enquiries as to special circumstances
attaching to any of the Condemned which would
warrant his Excellency exercising his preroga-
tive.”
“Very well, sir. Any thing else ?” The Under-
secretary was minuting the instructions.
How many did you say ? Twenty-two ?”
“Yes, sir.”
“ Then instruct the Sheriff to prepare for, say,
eight or nine. ” ,
“ Shall I get warrants ready in blank for that
number, then ? ”
The Colonial Secretary and Registrar of
Records assented—and passed on to consider some
tenders for the supply of handcuffs. There was
an hour’s, work in the tenders. But five minutes
then and twenty later on would polish off twenty-
two condemned.
* , • •
When Mr. Under-Secretary Harrington
retired to his own room, he called in his immediate
subordinate, and passed on the instructions.
“As to the 22 Condemned. Make enquiries as
to special circumstances attaching to any of them
which would warrant His Excellency exercising
mercy. Report at once, and get execution-orders
prepared as far as may be in blank for, say,
eight.”
“Yes, sir!”
Then the First Assistant Clerk went into
his room and delegated his assistant to wait
upon the Principal Superintendent of Con-
victs, and the Sheriff, and the Clerk of
Arraigns, with the view to procuring the
information necessary or desirable to be placed
before His Excellency the Governor-in-Council,
in order that that Providence in miniature might
decide which of the twenty-two were so fit for
Heaven that they could not longer be allowed to
pollute earth. And the assistant of the First-
Assistant listened deferentially, and made up his
mind that as they—the Executive—would not
hang more than eight or nine, he Would bother
his head about that number on the list and no
more. What was the use of looking up the
records of twp-and-twenty, when the work of
investigation as regarded two-thirds of that
number was foredoomed to be wasted? So he
reasoned and so he acted.
His assistant was a convict-writer. “Jervis,”
he ordered, writing out a pass as he spoke, which
would permit Convict-writer Jervis to pass through
the streets on public business ; “Jervis, goto
the Prin.-Sup.’s office and get the records of some
of the fellows condemned yesterday. You’ve got
the list there?”
“Yes sir. All, sir?”
“ No, take a dozen—no, eight will do !”
“ First eight, middle eight, or last eight, Mr.
Flippe?”
“ Oh," give ’em all an even chance. Throw the
ivories ! If you take first eight, the pris’ners in
the last case on the list won’t have a show at all.
You’ve got the pips there ? ”
Occasionally, Mr, Assistant-Clerk Flippe had
felt that the System subjected him to a severe
strain during office-hours, and he had recreated
himself after those times of stress by a judicious
handling of the dice-box. There was always the
c nvict-writer to play against, even supposing
that a brother free-clerk was indisposed to risk a
damn or a ring-dollar on the hazard of the die.
And’then, too, the dice-box and its cubes saved,
at other times, unnecessary mental wear and tear,
Suppose, for instance, some hundred or two appli-
cations for tickets-of-leave, duly authorised and re-
commended, were received during a single month,
it would be impossible to submit so large anumber
in one batch to His Excellency. A process of
selection would be indispensable, and nothing
would be easier than to throw the dice to decide
which applications should go in this month, and
which next month, unless, indeed, the simple plan
of throwing the names into a hat and drawing the
successful Ipplicants therefrom was resorted to.
But the dice box had an advantage over the
simple ballot, for the excitement which follows
upon the determination of competing chances is
greater than the excitement of mere selection,
As a means of deciding which good-conduct
transports were entitled to remission of servitude,
the use of the pipped “ivories ” was thus, you will
agree, unquestionably superior to anv other device,
It was so impartial. And this being so, what better
method could be adopted in deciding which of the
Condemned should live, and which should die?
Fate herself must use the dice in allotting their
destinies to human creatures, and there could be,
therefore, no valid objection to the lesser Fates of
the System employing the same machinery. But,
objection or no objection, it was all One to
Assistant-Clerk Flippe and his subordinate
Convict-Writer Jervis.
# # .■
They began.
Jervis took the slip on which was inscribed the
names of the Condemned, and pencilled figures 1
to 22 against the names, and then repeated the
same progression of numbers on ahother sheet,
“ Ready, sir!” he informed Mr. FHppe, And
Mr. Jervis twirled the dice-box, and flung the
paltry bits of bone out on his table. One of them
rolled on to a sheet of blue paper which had been
carelessly thrown down to wait registration and
filing. It was the Sheriff’s report of the previous
month’s executions which thus received the cube,
Flippe noticed the circumstance, and laughed.
“ That’s bad for No. 1, surely! He’s eager to
get on the coffin-list, isn’t he, Jervis ? NoW, how
many for him ?” He counted the three dice,
“ Six—five—two—total, thirteen I That one on
the coffin-list did him, Jervis ! It didn’t keep tip
the average for him. Put thirteen down to No. 1,
Jervis. Who is he?”
“ Moore, sir. ■’
“ Then I’ll sweat Moore Will be scragged,
Jervis !” _
Oh, thirteen’s pretty fair, Mr. Flippe. He’s
not half a bad chance.”
“I’ll back my judgment, Jervis—a fig of
tobacco against half-a--day’s work that Moore’s
left in?”
“Make it two figs, Mr. Flippe, and I don’t
mind. I’ll have to do the work at night if I lose,
and two figs are little enough for running the risk
of being nabbed by the watch before I get to the
barracks.”
“All right—it’s a Wager. Now, let’s see what
luck No. 2 has.”
No. 2 had worse. Flippe threw for him—Keyte
—a miserable, contemptible nine.
“Ha, ha, Mr. Flippe I” laughed the exultant
writer, who felt himself already in mastication of
two figs of succulent negrohead, “ ha, ha, Moore’s
chance is improving !”
“Jervis, you ass, you forget there are twenty to
go yet. It’ll be strange if I can't throw twelve
out of twenty above thirteen —deuced strange,
considering my usual luck with the beauties.” He
threw a third time, and confirmed his judgment
by turning up three sixes—a feat which he
repeated on the fourth throw,

With a lighter heart, for he did not enjoy the
rospect of doing Flippe’s work after hours, Jervis
noted No. 20’s eleven points. Connor was No. 20

that fact, Convict-writer Jervis trusted the Scrip-
ture would be realised in this case—that of two
men one should be taken and the other eft.

another. Now, here goes for the last —No. 22 !

“ That’s thirteen —they’re as good as reprieved,”

“ One each 12, 11, 10, 9 and 6, and two with 7.”
“ That makes 21. Now for No. 22. Who’s
No. 22, Jervis ?”
“Fleming, the bushranger, sir.”
“ Then it’s Fleming and your man, Moore, for
it. Here goes !” The dice clicked in the twirling
of the box, and were cast out glibly.
“Thirteen, as I live ! Double fives and a tray !
They’re running neck and neck, Jervis ! ”
“ And made a dead-heat, Mr. Flippe ! ” The
Convict- Writer applauded with as hideous a joke.
* * #
Neck and neck, and a dead-heat it was, on
the first running, but in the throw-off (for as
eight were to be hanged, it was useless bothering
to send nine names in on the list) the last com-
petitor won.
“Now, Mr. Flippe ! ” Jervis humorously
pleaded, as Flippe intimated he was about to
throw on behalf of Fleming, the robber-under-
arms. “ Now, Mr. Flippe, don’t cast heavy this
time! Give mo a chance ! Those extra returns
of yours are very complicated, sir ! ”
“ I know they are, and that’s the reason I am
going to throw large if I can ! There ! ” The cubes
faced to the tune of seventeen.
Flippe sent his loud merriment into the adjacent
rooms. “You’ve as good as lost, Jervis! And
just to show you there’s no trick, Jervis, throw for
Moore yourself! ”
Jervis grasped the box, shook it, and sprawled
the dice eagerly. Perhaps he may have given a
thought to Moore’s fate, perhaps his thoughts
were intent only on evading the task of preparing
those troublesome returns. We cannot say.
All we know is that he threw seven.
* # #
That was the manner of choosing which
Eight should be consigned to Paradise. As soon
as the choice was made, Convict-writer Jervis was
sent out (on pass) to get an assortment of records;
and as soon as he obtained them, he prepared a
list of “suggested commutations,” which included
14 names, and transmitted it to Mr, Assistant-
Clerk Flippe. And as soon as Mr. Flippe re-
ceived it, he initialled it and passed it to the First
Assistant Clerk; and the First Assistant Clerk
initialled it and filliped it forward yet another
stage into the hands of Mr. Under-Secretary
Harrington ; and then the Colonial Secretary got
it, looked to see if it bore the initials of Mr.
Under-Secretary, and being satisfied upon that
point, put his initials upon it, and delivered it to
the Clerk of the Executive Council for presenta-
tioir to the Governor-in-Council. And when the
Governor-in-Council had done with it, there re-
mained but the filling-in of the death-warrants,
and the trifling little ceremony on the scaffold.
Now, Father Therry had grown wise with a
grim, ghastly wisdom. He had learnt that fight-
ing with men of the System was next to useless,
and that if he complained against subordinate
officialdom and were so far successful in his com-
plaining as to obtain the supercession of the
offenders, he would not succeed in permanently
improving the quality of the administration. One
subordinate official was just as indifferent as
another to considerations of propriety ; and if A
were reprimanded or removed from office, B, his
successor, would carefully plant his feet in A’s
footmarks confident that the spirit of reform had
exhausted itself for the time. Consequently,
Father Therry did not waste time in reporting to
the head authorities the way in which the death-
list was made up. That was the sort of crude
thing which he attempted in the Early Twenties.
Now, this epoch being that of the Early Thirties,
he was wiser. After all, this method of selection
was, he reflected, likely to be as just as any
other which the System would adopt. The
ballot for reprieves had old-time custom to
sanction it, and it was no more a lottery than
sticking a pin blindfold into the list of names,
which was the pretty method that had commended
itself to the graceful fancy of Mr. Secretary Goul-
burn when the “ capital ” report from the Sessions
had been inconveniently crowded. So he held his
peace, but prayed the more fervently for the early
downfall of the System and for the souls of the
Unreprieved.
* * *
The dice-box and the Governor’s preroga-
tive had taken the fourteen ; and the Eight who
had been left came out on the damp, drizzly
morning to offer themselves sacrifices unto the
gods of gloom.
There were Moore, Keyte, Kelly, and Connor 1 ,
condemned for a burglary and “putting in fear”
at a hut on a farm belonging to Gregory Blaxland,
Esquire, at Illawarra; there were Walley and
O’Hara, for burglary and “putting in fear” in
the dwelling of J. Raymond, Esquire, Postmaster
to the Territory ; there was Welsh, for cutting
and maiming at Norfolk Island—Harris was the
ruffian who perpetrated the assault, but Welsh
had stood by and had not interfered ; and there
was Crampton, for high way robbery with violence.
Eight—two Protestants (Crampton and Walley)
and the rest Catholics.
They came out into the lumber-yard, where
their coffins were before them. And though the
morning was sombre, they blinked at the light,
for each of the cells they had left clasped lovingly
in its recesses the darkness of the graves they
were so soon to occupy. Still, they would have
liked a brighter day.
The two welcomed Mr. Cowper with wan
smiles’. And most of the others, when their
irons were struck off them, grouped themselves
round the priest. But Moore, a lad of twenty or
thereabouts, stood, white-faced and shivering, by
himself.
A warder pushed him forward, gently. “There’s
the praste, Moore, honey ! An’ don’t yez lose the
blessid moments as is passin’, me bhoy !”
Moore dazedly listened, but didn’t move. _ The
numbing of death was already upon his spirit.
The anxious priest looked in his direction and
sought to draw him to join the now kneeling
group by a tender glance of sympathy. But the
lad either did not catch the look, or refused to
understand its import. He was a shapely youth,
with eyes that should have been bright blue in-
stead of bearing in them a dull glassiness, and
cheeks that should have been rounded and tinted
with flower-bloom instead of being drawn to sharp
angles, and pallid with the fear of the dark,
mysterious sleep symbolised by the coffin at his
feet. That he was swayed by terror of the direst
kind was apparent to the Father, who would have
gone to him, but that the others were clinging to
him.
“Moore!” at last, in a momentary silence,
which followed upon a response of the Condemned,
who were kneeling before him, he dared to say.
“ Moore, my son, come here !”
The call did not rouse the lad from his lethargy
but it drew Mr. Cowper’s attention to the diffi-
culty in which his brother cleric was placed. He
looked round ; his own charges, Crampton and
Walley, hardened in features though they were,
had softened into a reverence of demeanour ; they
might be left to themselves for a moment, he
thought, and he stepped toward the poor, stupi-
fied lad, with the purpose of persuading him to
attend the priest.
“ My dear lad,” he said, thrusting his right
arm from the surplice folds as he spoke to clasp
Moore’s hand, and putting his left hand, which
held his prayer-book, affectionately on the lad’s
shoulder, “ there’s no time to lose. Come to
Father Therry!”
The touch, more penetrative than the words,
stirred the drowsy faculties of the boy. A great
spasm, epileptic almost in its intensity, seized
him, and he writhed in the convulsions born of
his fear. The clergyman tightened his clasp, else
the condemned youth would have fallen —tightened
it, and drew the boy’s head close to his own
breast.
Just then the measured sound of tramping feet
overbore the murmur of the praying Condemned,
and by another door than that by which the eight
had emerged into the Lumber-Yard, the Sheriff
entered attended by four Javelin-men. Fearfully,
with the poignant agony which cannot express
itself, like the dog or the rabbit under the
vivisectionist’s haire, Moore looked round —and
He clutched the clergyman in a vyee-like grasp,
awoke, fully, to the imminence of the dread doom,
and then drew the surplice-skirts over his head.
But the linen could notmuffle theory with which he
followed his sudden movements: “Oh, sir, save
me, sir—l am innocent, I was never near Mr.
Blaxland’s —never, sir. Do save me, sir, for
Father Therry can’t, an’ I’ll join your Church,
sir ! I’ll be Purtestant, I will, sir! ”
• # « .
Cut to the heart as “Old Man” Therry
was by that piteous cry, he was tenderestto Moore
once the fatal procession was formed.
“Never mind us, Father!” said O’Hara.
“There’s that poor Moore, sor. Luk to him!”
And the others of his penitents motioned consent,
and freed him for that painfullesb of ministra-
tions.
The boy was being helped along the muddy
path which led to the gateway into the street by
two of the Javelin-men when the priest spoke to
him, with an accent of authority in his tones. It
hurt him to use it, but he thought it best to do so.
“ Moore, be quiet, lad ! Be quiet, I say ! ” ——
“ I’m innocent! I was not there !” moaned the
lad. “ I’ll not die !”
“ If you are innocent, you die a martyr, and
the greater glory yours, dear Moore ”
“ I’m innocent! I was not there 1” went on the
plaint of the Condemned.
“Ah, Moore, lad”
“ I’m innocent. I was not there!”
“ I believe you, Moore! The Blessed God
knows I do”
“You believe I’m innocent, and yet you—you
let me die ! You’re no priest! You’d have saved
me else !” The moaning cry changed horribly to
an imprecatory bitterness.
“You’re no priest! I’ll turn Protestant, I
will!”
# * *
Because the morning was dull, perhaps, or
because there had been several like ceremonies
during the previous month or two, the crowd was
not very numerous. Had it been, however, five-
fold in number, it would have been thrilled to its
farthest margin by the words spoken from the
scaffold.
“ I’m innocent! I was never there !” cried the
boy, as the Sheriff asked him what he had to say
before he was capped. “ Was I there, Keyte ?”
Through his capped lips, Keyte muttered a
monosyllable: “No!”
“Was I there, Connor?”
Connor was not yet capped. His “No !” rang
out clearly, unhesitatingly, gladly.
“Was I there, Kelly ?”
Kelly was capped. He either did not attempt
to speak or could not make himself heard. But
he moved his head from side to side, in ah unmis-
takable negative.
“ There, sir ; there, Mr. Sheriff, will you let me
be hanged now !”
For answer, the Sheriff lifted his eyebrows.
And the cap was over the turning, twisting head
in half a second, and the clench of an assistant-
executioner’s hands held the convulsed limbs
firmly.
The Sheriff glanced down the row of capped,
pinioned creatures. He gazed in the eyes of the
chief hangman who was waiting, and
“Stay, one word!” cried Father Therry. “I
now declare to you Mr. Sheriff, and to you, good
people, that I believe Moore to be innocent! God
and all His blessed saints receive you, Moore !”
The Sheriff turned down his thumb.*

From an “elegy” by a new English
poet}—
(the wo6d is bare ;■ a river-mist is steeping
The trees that Winter’s Chill of life bereaves,
Only their stiffened boughs break silence, weeping
Over their fallen leaves.
In the early silver days of the Barrier,
two “ bushies ” cast anchor at a pub, a few miles
out of Silverton to go through the lambing-down
operation, One week sufficed to kill one, and
leave the other just alive. Things were done off-
handed in that shanty, and no time was lost
sending to town (some 14 miles) for a “box,”
which on arrival was found to be about a foot
short. Solemn council was held to bridge the
difficulty. Present (as the reporter says)— the
landlady, two of her friends, and deceased’s mate.
Business was gone into straight. “ Break ’is legs
and turnemup,” suggested the landlady; “don’t
see no other way.” This the landlady’s party
would have made the resolution of the meeting,
but for the blurted-out soliloquy of the mate—
“No ! damme if I'll see Tom’s legs broken.”
Then a long pause, which was broken by the
landlady addressing the question to the soliloquiser
—“What would yer do, then?” Tom’s mate had
not thottght of a way out of the trouble till the
query was put, but with a sudden, happy smile on
his boiled-looking countenance, he said—“ Cut his
head off and stack it in ’long with his legs !”
All parties joined in a discussion on this at once,
which Was only terminated by an appeal to a
thirsty soul who had just stepped in. “Wy!”
said he, “knock the tail o’ the blessed corfin out.”
And Tom now sleeps on the hillside with his feet
out in the cold.—P.N,

The Ancient Sailor-Man.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
According to a Melbourne paper, one of the
incidents at the wreck of the Fiji was the escape
of an ancient sailor, who came ashore grasping a
Bible. It had been given him by his mother, and
in three separate wrecks he had come ashore with
the treasured volume, everything else being lost.—
He was an ancient sailor with a dark, storra-
' beaten nose*
And he had a tattered Scripture that was hidden
in his clothes;
On the blackened rocks he sat and told the story
Of his Woes;
His mother gave the book to him in the joyous
days of old,
And often he had read it by a slush-lamp in the
hold,
When the frozen gale was shrieking and the
crested billows rolled.
And then, one day of gloom and wrack, the ship
fell overboard,
While in the wintry gloaming the frantic tempest
roared,
And the blast fell on the captain, and that officer
was floored:
Bdt this Saiibt seized his Scripture and started for
'the land ;
He reached it, damp and naked, with the Bible
in his hand,
While the other men were eaten by the prawns
along the strand.
He sailed again—the barque was loaded up with
kerosene,
And floating by some coral isles with hills of living
green,
The lightning struck it, and that vessel vanished
from the scene.
The starboard watch was shrivelled up and perished
in a heap,
The evil-minded second mate was frizzled in his
sleep,
And the steward seized the anchor and vanished
in the deep:
ilut this sailor-man arose, and o’er the blazing
bdlwarks he—
With all his whiskers flaming and his hair oil
fire -did flee,
And quenched his smouldering Bible in the silent,
emerald sea.
For months he lived alone upon an archipelago,
With his half-combusted Testament, and watched
the seasons go,
And the weary, glassy ocean in its ceaseless ebb
and flow.
He listened to the moaning winds and heard the
land-crab roar,
And watched the winkle as it walked upon the
ocean floor.
Till he was picked up by a ship bound for Aus-
tralia’s shore.
Its captain was a reckless man, and now and then
he cussed,
And sometimes, in his earlier days, had gone upon
the bust,
And the language of the crew would fill a Christian
with disgust.
So when the winds arose, and ghosts were shriek-
ing on the blast,
Hat sailot knew the voyage was the evil vessel’s
last,
And he took his Bible in his teeth and hung on to
the mast.
Next with a gruesome crash the noble vessel came
to grief,
And hung in fragments on the teeth of a black and
jagged reef,
And the sea was full of anchors, and jibbooms,
and kegs of beef.
But sundry natives lit a mighty bonfire on the
strand,
And presently they saw an aged sailor come to
land,
And put a sodden Scripture down to dry upon the
sand.
Then he sat down beside it with a sad, abstracted
look.
And musingly he chased the whelks from off the
sacred book
Till it was dry—and then be picked it up, and
took his hook.
TITUS SALT.
SHE PUT IT IN THE CUPBOARD.
What a weary thing it is to be ill, especially for a
long time. You are tired of advice, tired of try-
ing this, that, and the other, tired of fancying you
are a trifle better, tired of taking precautions
against getting worse. You are tired of pain, and
half believe the sooner you are under the ground
the better for you, and the more agreeable to your
friends.
Here’s a little story. A woman told it lately.
She says:
[Copy,]
“I, Mary Jones, of 3, Gal ton-street, Great
Howard-street, Liverpool, declare as follows :
“I have suffered all my life from weakness of
the stomach and sluggish liver. I was always
tired and languid, and often troubled with bilious
headache. My appetite was poor. I never had
desire for food, and what I did eat did not digest
properly. I had always a bad taste in my mouth,
and a slimy scum would cover my mouth and
teeth, and so bad was this that I was obliged to
rinse it away before eating. When I was in my
teens I was very weakly and would faint after
sitting down to my meals. I had trembling at
the heart, with a heavy weight at the chest, pain
at my side, and a strange giddy feeling would
come over me. When out walking in the street I
used to have to stand and rest for fear of falling.
I was also so weak that when going about my
work I often had to sit down and rest. At times
I had a bad cough and pain in my lungs. I saw
doctor after doctor, and was under medical treat-
ment for more than twelve years. One doctor
said I was suffering from an enlargement on the
liver, another said I had heart disease, a third
said my lungs were congested and that I could not
recover. Thinking I was now in a consumption,
I went to a consumptive hospital and was under
treatment there for some time. The doctors, after
sounding my chest, told me I was in a decline,
and that my left lung was congested. They gave
me cod-liver oil and other medicines, but I got no
better.
“ In July, 18£0, after a bad fainting, I became
so bad I had to take to my bed, and was attended
by three doctors for a month. The first doctor
who saw me said I could not recover. I had
intense pains in my stomach, and could get
nothing to pass my bowels. Various means were
tried and found useless. I could take liquid food
only, and was fast sinking, my case being con-
sidered hopeless by both the physician and the
nurse. At this time it was that my husband
heard through Mr. Parry, the chemist in Great
Howard-street, of a medicine called Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup, and we were presented
with a book which described a case just like mine
having been cured by it. My husband procured
a bottle of this medicine and I began taking it.
After a few doses I passed a motion as black as
coal and experienced great relief, and shortly after
felt as if I wanted something to eat. When the
doctor called the next day he could see a marked
change in me and said, ‘Mrs. Jones, we have
given you the right medicine at last.’ He thought
it was his last bottle that had worked the change,
whereas the nurse had put the medicine in the
cupboard untouched. 1 went on with Mother
Setgel’s Syrup, and to the delight of my husband,
father, and nurse I never looked behind me. All
the pain at the heart and chest gradually left me,
and in a fortnight I was strong enough to be
removed to the seaside, and have ever since been
in good health,
“I never felt so w r ell in my life as Ido now.
All my friends consider the cure as a miraculous
one, and I wish others to know by what means
my life was saved. lam willing that Messrs. A.
J. White, Limited, shall make whatever use they
may think fit of this statement, and I hereby
authorise them to do so.
“Dated this 3rd April, 1891.
“(Signed) Mrs. Mary Jones.”
There was nothing “miraculous” about this
lady’s recovery, although it may have been, and
indeed it was, remarkable. But it was all along
the straight lines of nature. She had suffered all
her life from indigestion and dyspepsia, and her
other ailments arose from that, and that alone.
She could not digest her food, and the whole sys-
tem was perishing from the poison in the stomach
and from lack of nutrition. Mother Siegel’s
Syrup did its one work : it cleansed away the cor-
rupted matter and set the digestive organs (the
liver, stomach, and bowels) in natural operation,
and immediate improvement and final recovery
followed as necessary consequences.
Especially should the reader notice the close
resemblance between the symptoms of dyspepsia
and those of consumption, through which most
unhappy mistakes are constantly made. Never
conclude you have consumption until you are sure
it isn’t dyspepsia. The chances are that the
results will be the same as in Mrs. Jones’ case.

Australian Cruelty.
In a recent cablegram the Australian temperament
is branded with “cruelty” on the authority of
-r rancis Adams.
_ tendency to cruelty is derived from our
English parents, who, among other things, said,
It will cure you ” because the nearest farmer
raked us aft with coarse salt from a blunderbuss,
as we struggled over his fence laden with green
apples.
Who shut us up in a dark room with the devil,
because we d d the eyes of the parson, for
mangling our baby toes as he crumpled our tiny
paw after morning service !
Who threatened to transfer us to the “Vernon ”
and to have us put in irons because we asked the
Lord in a prayerful whisper to note how we would
er w ° en we f> rew U P to man’s estate?
Who opened the oven-door and thrust us in
because we held the kittens near the fire to make
em squeak ?
Who tied us to the bed-post and menaced us
with a red-hot poker, because we struck matches
on the cot, in which that blessed cherub baby-
sister was slumbering ?
Who stuck a skewer into our leg, because we
angled the neighbour’s pet game-cock with a
large bread crumb, a bent pin, and six feet of blue
twine ?
Wliorwhipped us because we hitched an un-
healthy male goat to a go-cart and knocked the
“ stuffin ” out of him because he wouldn’t pull.
Who threatened to hang us by the neck till
dead, and actually suspended us by the body from
a beam because we tied a piece of cord across the
garden path, and then told our infant brother to
run down hard, which he did and spilt himself on
the gravel, making his flat nose flatter and
disfiguring his noble baby brow ?
Who threw our fireworks (representing four
months’ frugality) into the wash-tub because we
fired a rocket from the cook’s ankles ?
Who found a loose tooth in our head and
yanked it out with crochet-cotton, because we
fractured the butcher boy’s tooth with our
shanghai ?
Who held our nose and tipped half-a-bottle of
castor oil into us because we swallowed a taw ?
Who put us on dry bread and water for a day
because we gave the monkey at the Zoo a pebble
tied up in a few sheets of brown paper?
Who chained us by the leg to the dog-kennel
because we tied our new “ play pannikin ” and a
jam-tin to the poodle’s tail ?
Who grinned when we were chained because the
next door boy got upon the fence, leered at us,
defied us, thrust out his tongue laying it flat along
his chin and then curling it upwards to the tip
of his nose, closing one eye as he did so, put his
fingers to his nose, yelled—“ Here’s a lark ! Rats !
Rats! Sool ’em, Mungo;’’spat on a chip, flung
it away and shrieked, “Fetch it; ” ate an orange,
“ shied ” the peel at us, peppered us with the pips
through a pea-shooter, and cheeked us beyond en-
durance ?
Who christened us “ Sikes ” when we knocked
the next door boy off the fence with a shin-bone
and laid him up for five weeks with brain fever?
Who banished us to a boarding-school because
we fired at the stable-door with our air-gun and
drove a pellet through the stove-pipe hat of the
governor, who was inside the stable inspecting
our new pony ?
Who firstly and lastly recognised in us the dis-
position of our mother’s brother, and the nature
of our father’s mother ?

The men who saw Mayfcown in the heyday
of its prosperity would not now know the place.
With empty dwellings, deserted streets, and its
population of disease-stricken niggers and opium-
smoking Chows, the town presents a true example
of the yellow agony’s inevitable results. When
the news of the great Palmer Eldorado reached
China, the Chows flocked to Cooktown in scores
and hundreds till, during the height of the rush,
there were between 18,000 and 20,000 of them on
the field. Most of this horde have returned to
China, many have died, while others, worse luck
remained, and are now merchants, butchers, bakers
and hotelkeepers in and about Maytowu—in fact,
Maytown is nothing but a small Canton. There
is now not an English storekeeper or baker in the
place.

THE DIPSOMANIAC.
Dear Bulletin,— Having lived 13 years in
N.S.W., I can endorse all Christie Murray’s' assert inns
about the native-born Australian. 3 here is one thinir
Mr. Murray forgot to mention: the dishonesty of the
native-born Australian. With few exceptions here and
there they are mostly dishonest. There is another feaUne
in the native-born Australian I wish to mention : ho can
absorb any amount of false flattery and puffery, but a
word of honest truth sends him raving mad. — Balm aiv
[Next! Ed. B.] AW '
The latest natural-history yarn is told by
selector Le Mortemore, of Tinana Creek (Q.). He
has captured a tree-climbing pig, weighing about
1 cwt., and furnished with “ bristly brown fur ”
small black spots, pig’s snout and ears, front teeth
like a rat, large canines and powerful grinders •
fore-feet with hook-like claws, hind-feet with two
hook-claws each ; thick, prehensile tail a foot
long, generally carried in a Flemish coil ; a pouch
in which it carries its surplus food while “on the
wallaby.” Le Mortemore killed and ate this
“pig,” and avers that the flesh is excellent, and
tastes like veal and-ham pie. The animal climbs
trees and hangs cn to the boughs by its tail, while
it gathers grub. Le Mortemore is going to send
the skin to the Maryborough Exhibition, (Q.), and
intends to capture some live specimens and breed
from them. One theory lias been started that the
animal is a hybrid, the progeny of the marriage of
the common pig with the tree-climbing kangaroo.
Another theory is feasible : that the tale of Le
Mortemore is like the tail of the pig—thick, pre-
hensile and a foot long, and carried in a Flemish
coil.
Thus a correspondent ;—
“Price Warung’s” bookworm reminds me of a some-
what similar character, not unknown to Sydney people a
quarter of a century ago. Robert Vance had been a
clerk in the N.S.W. Treasury in the days of the old
Regime, and was enjoying a pension, that is, he enjoyed
it in his own fashion. He owned a terrace of three or
four houses in Sussex-street near Liverpool-street, in one
of which he lived alone, a miser’s life, in the midst of
filth. In an upper room, which was used for all domestic
purposes, he had a splendid library of standard authors
in elegant bindings stowed away in all manner of boxes
and other receptacles. He wished the writer to find him
a customer for the lot, but on visiting the place the odour
was so overpowering that a hasty retreat was beaten.
He was recommended to offer his library to Sir
Redmond Barry, but with what result is not
known ; certain it is that on his death the
books had disappeared. The old fellow dressed in a
most singular manner, an old watch coat down to his
shoes, an old cotton handkerchief round his neck, and the
most ancient and oddly-shaped of stove-pipe hats. Not a
hit of white was v isible, and people used to say that the
hat, the coat, the shoes and the cotton “ wipe ” were the
only clothes he wore. He was supposed to be without
relatives, but when his death was announced a nephew
substantiated his claim, and succeeded to the property.
Then a claimant appeared in the person of a now M.L.C.,
who sued for some hundreds of pounds sterling, which
he claimed to have advanced to the old man. The
accounts w ere kept in what is known as a “ penny pass-
book,” and were disputed by the heir-at-law. A Supreme
Court jury, however, found for plaintiff. The old house,
in Sussex-street, was demolished, and the land now lies
idle.
Good old Ambrose Bierce in the S.F.
Examiner :—
I assume that this paper’s account of Mrs. Lucy Pratt
submitting to the removal from her body of 45 square
inches of skin to patch up a railway mail clerk scalded
in a collision is true. I assume that it is true that she did
this in order.to obtain a reward of one hundred dollars
offered by him and that she needed the money for sup-
port of herself and her children. Well, I have not the
gratification of approving the transaction. I do not
think the life of any male of our species worth 45 square
inches of skin taken from any part of a good woman’s
body. It is to he hoped the brave woman will recover,
and that the selfish man (whose name is Daggett) will
live or die, just as ho would have done without the patch-
ing. If men are ever too mean to die he will be spared
to us until he experiences a change of heart. An
honourable man would have suffered a thousand deaths
rather than accept his life on such terms as the mutila-
tion of a good woman; her assent cuts no figure
in the matter. On learning that she was willing
and needy, Mr. Daggett should have given her
the money and died like a gentleman. This
peeling a woman to re-cover a man will not do—
emii ently not. There is law, too, for its suppression. If
the three physicians—one a woman who seem to have
been concerned in the Prat,I-Daggett affair have not
subjected themselves to indictment, I’m a crop of
barley! It would he very funny to see my good and
clever friend Dr. Chismore playing at checkers with his
nose because he could not curb the lust for skin-grafting
nor refrain from joining together what God had put
asunder. Nay, he was not required to curb, but only
regulate: to the right and sufficient gratification of his
ambition he might have repaired the Daggett with a
broad slab of congenial dog. Or he could have half-soled
the fellow with cow, and then the chap would have “ had
good leather in him.” But the skinning of women for
any purpose whatever is not in harmony with the spirit
of the law. Consent be jamboozlcd I A woman’s skin ia
inalienable ; she has no right to shed it. She is not that
kind of snake.

SM O It\ CERTIFICATE, — One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong, ‘
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugblmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left l.ung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectoratingevery day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken had one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.

Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.
