The Garden Palace Fire and the “Occu-
pation Branch.”
Among the papers in the Garden Palace were
certain records in duplicate belonging to the
Occupation Branch of what is absurdly called
the “Department of Mines.” There is a history
pregnant with meaning attached to these docu-
ments. Till within a few years, the occupation of
the squatting lands was mainly administered by a
staff of District Commissioners. This staff was
part of the organisation inherited from the old
Imperial system. These commissioners took a
high position as administrators and magistrates.
They were generally experienced colonists, as well
as men of education and culture. Many of them
were pioneer bnshmon, besides being trained
officials. One or two of them had been familiar
with the interior sinoe the time of Sir Thomas
Mitchell and the first opening of Rivenna, and
their reports' often possessed lha value of State
Papers. The least experienced of the staff kpew
’ more about the great grassy wastes df Australia
than those who are in these times believed to be
chiefly interested in them,' whether as modern pas-
toral lessees, Melbourne financiers, or Sydney
politicians.
To make the position of these officials clear, it
Is necessary to explain that in the school where
the senior commissioners were reared—through
whom the whole body acquired a certain character
and stamp—there was encouraged a certain in-
dependence of opinion, and it was usual for omoers
occupying such positions of trust to state their
views on questions of administration when they
believed that the public good required it. A
Government functionary was supposed, in the
Imperial service, still to retain in some measure
the public spirit of a citizen, and the independence
of feeling natural to a gentleman. In connection
with the supervision exercised by him, each oom-
missioner had a local office, and there the records
of the district since pastoral oooupation began
were kept, duplicate copies being sent to the De-
partment in Sydney. Papers at head-quarters,
we all know, are not easily got; but these district
records were, and when any local question arose,
the commissioner could and did refer to the docu-
ments with a precision and cogency that made the
real facts apparent at once.
• • •
The existence of these District Offices and Local
Records did, in fact, provide a standing protest
against centralised muddle and misgovernment,
and they afforded the most excellent evidence in
favour of the advantages of localised administra-
tion But, so much the less were the commis-
sioners with their records in favour at the centre
of politics, for, in the measure of their efficiency
and thorough grasp of their work, they diminished
the legitimate advantages to be derived from
Ministerial patronage and Parliamentary agency.
In short, the oommisioner occupied an honourable
position, which he filled-or was expected to fill,
under the traditions of the old regime—with be-
earning independence and dignity. But this har-
monised badly with modern politics. As
parliamentary life developed in the colony, the
anomaly which the Occupation Branch presented
became more marked. Under this political view,
the Local Records were most objectionable, as
they contained matter which should be used only
for Ministerial purposes, and the men who held
them in their custody were quite unsuited tor the
practical duties to be expected from subordinates.
These functionaries settled questions brought
before them simply according to the facts or each
case without deterring to or ascertaining before-
hand the political interests of the Ministry. And,
to the last, they continued to send in their reports
and assessments in conformity with their daily
observations, and the evidence brought betore
them, without qualifying their official deliverances
to suit what the head of the Department had
stated in Parliament.
• • •
A staff of officers like this could not well but be
abhorrent to the politicians who have been in power
for the last five or six years. A Minister for Minos
or far some other Augean chaos, who had jumped
from a mining rig or an oyster saloon inta office,
naturally felt that the existence of such a body of
man was a standing insult and injury to himself.
Certainly, to any Ministry that wanted to introduce
a statesmanlike Land Act, such as has been framed
in New Zealand and elsewhere, a staff_ of officials
like these would have been of inestimable ser-
vice. Their long experience of various methods,
their observation of the cause of settlement, their
knowledge of locality and experience of climate,
would have provided material of priceless value
both as conveying ideas in shaping legislation and
in its practical adaptation subsequently. But no
Ministry of New South Wales has yet aimed at
snob high game The dominant policy is much
narrower, but infinitely more practical. Their aim
is usually to keep in, and subordinates with opinions
are undesirable. Consequently, a commissioner of
the old stamp was not the sort of official wanted
in the political exigencies of the times. Something
more ductile, more crawling, with less head-piece
and no backbone, was the kind of creature wanted.
• • •
The chance to get rid of the staff came in due
time. For years the cream of the territory had
been selling to the extent of millions of acres
annually. Frontages, choice spots, all the good soil
and water—in fact, all the eyes were picked out over
the best districts. The public estate was being fairly
gutted, and yet, withal, the public voice declared
both through the Assembly and the Press that the
squatting rentals were quite inadequate. Some
authoritias said they should be five times what
they were; all agreed that they should be doubled
at least; in effect voxpopuli said that they “ would
eat their cake and have it, too.” The Ministry
paid no heed to any arguments on the other side.
In vain it was pointed out that if a lessee bought
up the greater part of the land on his run, or ail
the bast spots, the rent would, under any possible
assessment, be lowered and not raised in proportion
to the value and area of the portions withdrawn
from lease. It was also shown cleariy'that a groat
deal of country remained oompafatfvtly unim-
proved and unused under the ever-impending
menace of selection ■, while the coat of dam-making
and other improvements was trebled by the in-
security of tenure and the black mail levied by
the land-pirates. The rental value of such country
naturally diminished from these reasons. A run
was worth very little if it could be disembowelled
by three or four selectors on the next Thursday.
This reasoning was aeoepteii only by outsiders.
It had no weight in the fiotise, little in the Press,
and was not recognised at all Ministerially. It
happened that the last appraisement sent in by
the commissioners was very unsatisfactory. It
had not been drawn up in any way in conformity
with Ministerial opinions. The return was not
based at all on such generalisations, or theories of
policies, as those which we have quoted, but was
framed from measurements, figures, and calcula-
tions derived from ascertained facts. Still they
pointed to the very same conclusion. The rental
could not be increased in anything like the ratio
expected if the best of the runs were sold. If
a minimum rate was imposed on unim-
proved lands, much new country would be
thrown up, and would pay no rent at
all. So said the commissioners. This
was enough. They were dismissed with six
months’ notice, and a new staff of appraisers was
appointed. If the commissioners nad recom-
mended that the rentals should be trebled all
round without going into minute inquiry, high
places and good Ithings would have been open to
them. They might even some day have eat at
Ministsrial banquets. But they were not politi-
cians. They had no friends keeping public-houses
in the city or engaged in copper-mining on
the Laohlan, so they were dismissed with less
ceremony than would be shown to a railway
swabber backed by the interest of an East Sydney
C.M.G.
« • •
Before they had finally surrendered thoir func-
tions, the first return of the new appraisers earn*
in i and, strange to tell, though it had been con-
ducted under strict rule laid down by the Minister,
it corresponded to a wonderful extent with the
returns of the previous year the condemned
work of the old commissioners. The more
minutely the grazing country was scrutinised, the
more the substantial accuracy of the staff was
confirmed, and the anticipations and foregone
conclusions formed by the Ministry and the public
“ intelligence ” were stultified. The Government,
dissatisfied, determined on a re-appraisement, and
the pastoral rents of 1881 remain undecided to
this day. But the friends of centralisation and
Parliamentary jobbery had scored something in
the game. The obnoxious commissioners were
abolished, and their district records were safely
looked in the archives of - the Department.
• • •
It is useless to think now of what would have
been saved if the detestable greed of patronage
and jobbery, and the social envy and jealousye
which broke up the commissioners’ staff and,'
removed the records, had not been indulged, ana
things had been left as they were.
• • *
Sir John Robertson has chosen to make
light of a loss that in value of material and work-
manship must have approached half a million. The
losses of Art and Science are incalculable. But, the
destruction of our pastoral records may
involve evils which cannot be forecast,
and which cannot be measured by any
standard. The possibilities of fend and litigation
liable bo spring from this calamity, place it among
the category of events which are not suitable
subjects for pot-house jokes. We have suffered
enough already from these evils, in the ordinary
working of our land law without a new dislo-
cation which may multiply them tenfold. How the
mischief is to be mended, offers an enigma to
every maa in the habit of thinking, for all the
descriptions of runs and the rights of lessees, as
registered officially .representing an industry cover-
ing six-sevenths of the colony, went up in black
smoke on the morning of the 22nd September.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“So Help Me, God!”
A bill was brought in to substitute a simple declara-
tion for the blasphemous old oath, and Sir Heniut
Parkes opposed it successfully. He took the high
ground that " this nation is built on a Christian basis,”
and that therefore, before permitting Jokit Honan to
affirm in Court that his goat did not stray into Mother
Muggins's bock yard, it is necessary for John to call
on the “ Loan of all Power and Might,” the “ Lord
God of Hosts,” the “ Everlasting One,” and ‘‘Kino of
Kings,** to come down and bear witness he is speaking
the truth. Christianity has advanced to a startling
stage when the Master’s words, ‘‘Let your yea be
yea,” is ruled out of order as impracticable, and mem
of our Premier’s type stand up and plead for the reten-
tion of a formula more blasphemous than the lowest
idolatry is capable of. The Pagan swears by his idol,
and we smile. To us, living in these days, and having
advanced to the idea of One Supreme Power, whose
greatness is unnameable, is handed forth a form of oath
that would disgrace the raauuderings of a joss-house.
Sir Henrt lightly turns from the opinions of Whachi.y
or Buckle —and prefers the opinions of " eminent
jurists ’’—Sir James Martin, say. He does not think
a person who believes not in the existence of hit
Gon is fit to hold high office under the State. He has
taken the oath, and is in office, representing the
triumph of Christian principles, aud pleading for them
in open Parliament. But who or what is Sir Henrt’*
god P Is he the One who “ took flesh aud dwelt among
us,” leaving au immortal example of unselfishness and
absolute truthfulness t To what a depth of blasphem-
ous Indifference to Truth have we come, when it*
championship is permitted to drift into the hands of
proved charlatans, and the holiest precepts are lightly
wielded by such to carry out the ends of a
paltry and contemptible ambition ? It was such
spectacles as this that made Thomas Carlyle’s
heart heavy, and made of the old man’s life one
long moan. The foib.es of men are bitter enough
to see; but when the few high ideals of humanity fall
a prey to the ignoble purposes of unscrupulous men
when to conciliate/the miserable prejudices of the joss-
house —what we call sectarianism —a plain stride in the
direction of common sense and increased reverence feu:
truth is coolly obstructed as tending to atheism, —what
words can describe the horror of it? Every man in
Parliament is ntcova in. Is there a fool in the com-
munity who can see, that from the Premier down, the
politician’s vote on any question is determined in the
slightest degree by his oath ? Or that the truthfulness of
any witness is guaranteed by the fear of any penalty
other than human law has fixed ? The bill is thrown
out. Premiers and hon. members have recorded their
horror of atheism; and we swear away as usual. W*
are a Christian nation. Every man is ignoring himself
and hunting up the good of 7vi« fellows. ■ And to this
the whole majority, who assented to Sir Henry’s
motion, will say, “ Yes, so help me, God.”

d»as figured rather largely in the public eye. Ha came
with a blare of trumpets as the defender of old beliefs
and the reconciler of traditional doctrines with new
knowledge. He has been accepted as such by large
audiences. What have we to say of such men ? Hia
name has been openly flouted in the face of thinkers of
greater ability, and his deliverances have been paraded
as oracles. We have this to say. Before Joseph’s
beard was fairly grown, and when, from his own account,
lie had just gone through the usual course of barren
academics, he made up that callow hit of pulp which he
was pleased to call “ his mind,” and deliberately laid
himself out for a campaign. Against what ? Against
views and speculations which have revolutionism!
modern thought as thoroughly as ever the Copemican
theory upset the drivel of ages. He would put down
“modern infidelity;’’—that’s the word he applied to
the manly blows which have shattered for ever the old
rattle-trap speculations of our grandmothers. To this
end he appears to have travelled, and also to have gone
through most of the works of modern thinkers—not, as
Bacon says,to “weigh and consider,’’but to “contradict."
A beautiful programme, truly. When every ether man
with a serious thought in his head enquired concerning
old beliefs “ whether these things be so,” Joe donned
his war gear 20 years ago, said they are so, and went out
to collect scalps from amongst the infidels. A mighty
collection now swings in his wigwam, and he caa
point you out scalp locks from all tribes and all ages,
from the pig tail of the Confucians to the poor
old feeble head-gear of Spencer or Schopen-
hauer, Job is never short of a pipe light while the
scanty pows of the old or new philosophers dry on the
peg; and to all and sundry of the venerable welcomers
who come out and call him king, he will strike you a
match. Out pipes, you superannuated clerics; and all
ye Christian Young Men, haul out your meerschaums,
and let us smoke the gods 1 Australia’s religious future
is assured! They listen to Joe and) must therefore
have a population of 100 millions soon—all believers in
Joe. You hand him money for his cool effrontery in
summing up men who have warped a generation; and
he hands you in return a blessing from Isaiah. A very
few years settle men of Joseph's stamp. They pass
into the oblivion of the old disputants. Their imagin-
ary stately craft sails only on a painted ocean. They
must came off the stately Pacific of their imagination
and mend their fishing smack in the Straits.
The Judgment of Solomon.
When that much-married monarch was appealed to, to
settle the ownership of a child, he declined jurisdiction
by proposing to cut the youngster fairly in two. When
George R. Dibbs suggests the appointment of a Council
of Conciliation to settle strikes, he proposes to con-
stitute it on similar principles; that is, following the
notions of Solomon and the French Prud'hommes, he
does not consider that the first instinct of “ short and
sweeping ’’ measures should be adopted; but that in
difficult cases, no harm is done in giving disputants
time to cool down and solve their troubles in less
heroic fashion. Not clearly seeing his way to a straight-
forward and immediate solution of the difficulty, the
astute monarch suggested that the parties disputing
should use their own wits to settle their differences. Mr.
Dibbs’s proposal for dealing with our strikes is on
somewhat similar lines. The relations of capital to
labour are of such a complicated nature that he advises
the commonsense course of relegating disputes, as
they arise, to a tribunal consisting of members selected
from amongst employers by employes, and vice versa.
On a dispute arising, it is proposed that the grounds of it
belaid before the Council; that work go on as usual; and,
ns in the case of a disputed mining tenement, someone
act as receiver for the amount in question ; both sides
to be bound to receive the decision of Council as final.
One has only to consider the lasses both to employers
and employes from the present impracticable system,
to see the feasibility of Mr. Dibbs’ suggestion. Means
should be adopted to prevent the loss of time and
temper which now follows any attempt at strike.
At present the workmen refuse to budge, and the
employers refuse to be dictated to. Result: annoyance
and mutual dissatisfaction. But, with a fixed arrange-
ment for referring disputes to a trusted tribunal as they
arise, a good deal of the bitterness might be done away
with, and some approach be made to a peaceable and
common-sense adjustment of differences. If any hitch
occurs in adopting some such plan, it will not be the
fault of the employes.
Australian Wines.
Australian wines are coming into prominence at home
through our exhibits at the Bordeaux Exhibition. As
usual, Victoria has eclipsed New South Wales there.
Recognising the necessity of making a good show, if
any, our neighbours have gone into this metier with
their usual energy and go-aheadism. As a result of
this, their colony occupies, in her own name and right,
no less than two-fifths of the area allotted to colonial
courts; New South Wales and South Australia taking
a subordinate place with only two-fifthe between them.
The consequences of Victoria’s foresight are already
making themselves apparent, in the order received by
Messrs. Castella and Rowan, of the St. Hubert’s
Vineyard, from a firm of London wine merchants,
or fifty hogsheads of various wines at prices from ss.
to 10s. per gallon. The value of the whole will be £l2OO,
being the largest order yet received for Australian
wines. It is gratifying, of course, to see this growing
demand, but the question here arises as to whether the
colonial wines thus ordered are merely for “ blending,’*
or for sale on their merits ? Our Commissioner’s letter
—replete with “wholesome fan"—throws some light
on this. He says that we have the reputation of a
wine-growing but not a wine-making community. We
are, therefore, good only, perhaps, to supply welcome
material for French and English vintners. This is
not a pleasant outlook for our wine trades, if really the
the matter stands thus. It is matter too suggestive of
the fate of our Australian mutton trade. It will soon
be possible for a man to sit down in London or Paris,
and dine on Australian mutton and Australian wine
under other names.
Reform of the Civil Service.
In various ways and at different times a general com-
plaint rises about the inefficiency of the Civil Service,
Now it is the Post Office, now the Lands, again the
Education Department. One complains that ho can’t
get his papers, another that if he writes to tbe Lands
Office he never gets an answer, and a third has got a
grievance against some other department. There
must be something radically wrong in a service when
there is a continual complaint about it. And when wo
examine the matter a little, it does not seem quite so
strange that this should be the case. For the Civil
Service of New South Wales is badly manned, badly
directed, and badly paid. It is badly manned, because
there is ro other method of gaining a place in it than
through intrigue; it is badly directed, because there is
no inducement for able men to Join it; and it is badly
paid, because the bad personnel of the Service renders it
necessary to employ more men to do a given amount of
work than otherwise would be required. We may as
well say at once that we do not expect any improve-
ment of the existing order of things until the present
system, if system it may be called that system has
none, be displaced in favour of competitive examina-
tion. Passing in the following subjects makes the
pa-see eligible for appointment to the C.S. of N.S.W.:
—English, simple arithmetic, history, geography,
writing from dictation. In England, a similar examina-
tion is only the threshold to trial in the following
subjects English composition, history of England,
English language and literature; language, history, and
literature of Greece, Rome, Italy, Germany, and
Prance; mathematics, natural science, moral science,
jurisprudence, and political economy. Of course, all
these subjects are not obligatory, but the would-be
English public servant must make a good show in such
as he chooses. Th# system of competitive examination,
to be sure, has its defects. Readers of Mr. Herbert
Spencer’s works will remember a luminous chapter in
his “ Study of Sociology," upon this subject, wherein
the great Englishman shows no love of the system.
We may admit that a man may come out of a
literary examination with fiying colours, yet be no
fit man for a position of responsibility. Still we
do not out the ground from bonsath our feet.
To have an efficient public service you must have an
educated public service. And the way to gain this is to
make the gate so narrow that the minimum of numb
skulls shall pass in, and, 2ndly, to make the position
worth gaining and worth retaining. Let us insist on the
Government taking example from England in this
respect, naming a commission of competent persons to
frame a code of subjects, and to make arrangements for
a stringent examination; then let the Government
draft those who shall pass this examination into the
public service. Thus we shall have educated men
filling the offices of State, not raw youths and brainless
athletes and valetudinarians. And let the Government
pay such salaries as shall make those offices worth
striving for, an object of ambition to the aspiring and
able youth of the country—not as now, mere refuges for
the idle, the infirm, the superannuated, and the unam-
bitious. Then shall we have a Civil Service that will
really serve the people, that will earn its pay by ster-
ling work, not pretence of work, and that will
command respect. By this means India has a
Public Service that is second perhaps only to
Germany’s in many-sided efficiency, in sterling
working qualities, and in adaptation to the needs
of the people and the emds to be gained. We commend
these suggestions first to those who administer the
affairs of this country, and then to those who pay for
such administration —to the Parliament and to the
People. It must in fairness be acknowledged that there
are good men in the Civil Service of the colony, but
tkey are to the incompetents as the bread to the sack
in Sir Jong Falstaff's tavern bill. A measure glibly
promised at the opening of Parliament was one to place
the Service upon a satisfactory basis. If that can be
done, if the Service can bo so remodelled that the square
ma* shall not get into the round hole, then wa will
welcome the chaage, come it whence it will.
A Tedious Process.
The body of Francis Heenan, who is believed to have
been poisoned by Burrs, at Wicklifle, in February,
1879, is to be exhumed. This makes the third exami-
nation of the bodies of suspected victims of this man
Burns. TMe headless corpse mystery remains unsolved,
and an endeavour is being made to come at a solution
by this grisly method of inductive ratioaination. Burns
is either a very unfortunate man, or a most bloodthirsty
miscreant, and the people with whom he has come in
contact the most unemotional and invertebrate beings
on the surface of the planet. In California, in the old
days, a short shrift and a long rope, in the hands of
“ the Vigilance,” would long since, fummarily, if un.
satisfactorily, have solved this gruesome mystery. But
we have not had a single instance of lynch law in these
colonies. Either the detestation of crime, or the strong
vitality of ths early American pioneers, has been want-
ing, or else the respect for the tedious processes of law
is very deeply ingrained in Australian society. This
man Burns has been tried and re-tried for murder.
Now he’s to be arraigned again. Some of these days
these repeated trials will influence the minds of a jury,
and they will promptly hang him out of hand. Judge
Lynch had more mercy for his victims than that. He
either hanged his man, or let him loose. But the
gradual nerve shattering process of law and order is a
refinement of cruelty which the simply virtuous and
strong-minded advocates of law in the pioneer’Frisco
days never soered up to.
The Herald (Sydney Morning, of course) comes down
rather roughly on the House of Commons, Fortnightly
Review, Pall Mall Gazette, Daily News, and a whole
bundle of snch latter literary tra«h, for their etriciures
on Colonial Governors and Governments who have
winked at the game commenly called “ black-birding,”
and shut their eyes altogether at the innocent pastime,
practised up till very recently by our own squatters, of
“ potting darkies.” The Herald has not heard of the
game, and for this very small reason concludes that it
was never played. We don’t for one moment suppose
that our backwoodsmen ever ran a flock of darkies
down into the Herald’s composing-room to butcher
them, and, if not, how else could the Herald hear of
the occurrence? If, however, the Herald will send
some one up to enquire how many aborigines there
were living on the banks of the Darling, Warrego,
Paroo, Bulloo, and other rivers in New South Wales,
only twenty years ago, and then deduct the number
now alive from that total, the question will suggest
itself: Where are the blacks ? Bad rum and good lead,
if these things could but speak, might answer: “ We
cooked 'urn.”
Isn’t it high time that the parsons set about praying
for rain ? It’s well known—in fact everybody is con.
vinced of the fact —that our medicine men and white-
tied tom-tom rain-beaters have the power of bringing
down water from the clouds; and this being so, how
can they justify their present indifference to the
deplorable condition of the back-blocks ? The wind, it
is true, is still from the west, but this can’t be regarded
as a legitimate excuse. What are we supporting these
people for? It would nay any big station-holder to
procure the services of half-a-dozen rain-beaters in
opposition to the diamond-drill, which gets water from
Below instead of from Above. We have it on good
authority that the average of a well-known anti-Art
Gallery fakir, who used to howl the leaves oft the trees
in the Domain, is six inches of rain to every four
hours marrow-bone incantation ; and we hear that the
reaaonl that Archbishop Vaughan hasn’t prayed
publicly is that the Hawkeshury people haven’t got
their crops in yet, and are afraid of a flood.
The Corporation has adopted the finding of its finance
committee re the “Coonanhara” charges against the
eminent Alderman John Davies, C.M G. It has like-
wise declined to pronounce that Davies has been found
guilty of conduct unworthy of an alderman and should
be called on to resign. In other words, though the
city fathers concur in the verdict of “ guilty,” they
censider the little transaction imputed to Davies by
no means calculated to damage the character—of an
alderman. Here, perhaps, they are perfectly in accord
with a large section of public opinion. However, the
Council is going to find funds out of the City treasury
for the Mayor’s defence in the slander action brought
against him by Davies— whose lay counsel and journal-
istic marionette, the Morning Rum, has raised a howl
of indignation. The Rum argues that the proposed
expenditure* is ultra vires. The white men of this city
—all who wish to bring about a purity of public life
unknown in Sydney—will and must hold that the
contemplated disbursement is just as legitimate as
an expenditure devoted to cleaning out sewers. Mean-
while. Mysterious John’s mauyjpuppets will probably
go for an injunction.
Mr. H. S. Badgery, M.P.
On the front page of our supplement appears a por-
trait of Mr. H. 8. Badgery, one of the members for the
Monaro. Few men are more widely known in con-
nection with the great pastoral industry ef the country.
In politics Mr. Badgery is a worker, not n talker, and
one of the few independent members of the Assembly.
TO CORRESPONDENTS.
[Correspondents who give neither name nor nom-de-plume
cannot expect to have their communications noticed .]
“E.J.K.”: Right “W.S.L.”: Thanks
"EB,’ 1 ! Simply “immense.” “G.W.S.”: Neverad*
vertise for a very poor friend. You can’t expect a man
who k»a not saen hia breakfast to have seen the Herald.
“ Peterahamite ” : A mere verbal error “ Upper
Port-street”: Should he survive this defence, he may
be quiescently happy, whatever Fate may have in store
for him Nothing worse than this can befall him if he
live as long as a toad in a stone. For
A man may live down scorn whose skin
Is thick as hide of mule,
But he’s hard to kill who doesn’t die
When friended by a fool.
“ Ashfleld” : Your contract yarn may be quite true, but
it’s too straight. It’s as straight as the remark of the
lawyer who described the witness’s face as “stretching
across the wide desolation of his face, the sepulchre of
rum and the fountain of falsehood.” “ W A.”:
Thanks, but it doesn’t matter ”E.B.’’: Thanks.
We have received the same item from half-a-dozen
different quarters “Hunter”: No. Since the acces-
sion ef Queen Victoria, in 1837, there has been war, on
the average, every three years “ Gordon and Co.’’:
Xo\x don’t lay before us a statement of the whole case.
J.C.H.”; Will read and consider “J.C.”: We
can find no authority for demanding a fresh deal. As
the game is most played in America, there is much to
be said in favour of any practice that holds good in that
country “G. 8.”: Thanks; but Joseph is a bit
played out now. With regard to his charity, it is like
that of many other gentlemen in the same line, “it
begins at home —and stays there.” “ H.J.” Thank
yon, dear Ker-istian brother “Lynceus”: A
bad choice of subjsots—but not bad form
*‘H,M.”: Yeu say it is “ decidedly low” of us to call
Mrs. E. Lynn Linton a “deaf old woman.” Why, sonny ?
We presume it she is a Mrs. she is a woman? If she is
55 she can’t be yonng. And if she can't hear, well what
the deuce can she be but deaf ? Supposing you were
someone's valet, would you designate yourself “ a
gentleman’s gentleman P” ” S.L.H.”: Acceptable,
but too long. We shortened considerably “ Bur-
netta” : We did receive a par, hut did not publish, as
it was palpably spiteful “Marsupial”: WeTl let
Syntax rest “Protos”: Thanks; but next time not
too much dress, please “ E.R.P.” : Merely inferior
verse " G.B. (Waverley) : You neither gave us
names nor slightest clue to identity of the people.—
We must know what we are publishing ‘"China-
man ’’: Your letter will be published “ J.W.8.” :
Will attend to it “ A Subscriber ”: Thanks
“ Artillery Man ” : A good illustration, *f which w#
shall gladly avail ourselves “ Draftsman ’’: Next
week “ H.” : There does not now seem to be a
single department concerning which allegations of
internal corruption are not made. However, you
must send us some specific information “ Spes ” :
Too late for this issue “ A. T. J.” : Why don't you
tell us why ? “J. N.“: Will see what can be done
with it “ Vessels to arrive Thanks. Will fix it
up “J P.“: You shoald have given us names
“ A Subscriber” : We think you’re a little rough on
Sir Julius.
At the New Zealand Exhibition, just concluded,
Singer’s Sewing Machines have carried ove*spthlng fee-
fere them, taking a first order of merit, two gold medals,
and two silver medals. The New Davis was awarded a
silver medal,
THE PEELER’S ROMANCE;
OR, THE COOTAMUNDRA CONSTABLE.
At Cootamundra, once, a trap
With love a young: gal filled her.
The peeler’s name was Richard, and
The gyurl was called Matilda.
Their troth they plighted and, ah, oft
The paddock they walked through it;
His hand around her waist—her head—
But you know how they do it.
They laughed, and sang, and played,—oh, they
Were blithe as two young kittens ;
A book of poems be gave her, and
She knitted him some mittens.
And all went gay and merry, till
Dick struck another dart; he
Observed a nice girl smiled on him,
So smole on that fair party.
While Tilly was away (of her
Soft eye he was the apple)
He took up with the other one,
And bore her off to chapel.
“ What! wedded ?” cried she; “ peeler false ?”
" Now, dry up, ’Tilda,” hissed he ;
“ You’ve * carried on ’ with Deherty,
And * giddy ’ been with Christy.”
The case came on, but, lo ! the Judge
Pooh-poohsd that lover shifty :
The peeler got a nasty deal—
Costs and a cool “ one fifty.”
The constable now groans all day,
His grief he ill can carry;
While Tilda’s booked a passage for
The “ Continong ” and “ Parry.”

ONE OP THE WORLD'S GREATEST
OARSMEN.
IK a Meant conversation in Kingston, Canada, with
a representative of one ef the foremost journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Triokott, the celebrated
oarsman, who is at present open to row any man in the
world, gave the following as his opinion.
*' I have found St, J ACOB’S OIL a sure and certain
care, and one aneq nailed by any medicine. It cored
mo of severe pains in bank, brought on by over-ex,
ertion la rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sore
remedy, penetrating at onoe to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without farther trouble."
The writer listened attentively to the above. It was
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who knew what ho was talking about; and now he rays
that St. JACOB’S OIL am good athletic training, ar
what all Our young men want.

certificates of merit from the managers of all the

bruises, sores, san-bums, corns, bunions, and baa a
cdkative effect on lung complaints, when rubbed into
the chest. Every Householder should keep a pot.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
The Marquis of Bute is building a house that
has cost £250,000. The noblo Marquis went to school
at Harrow, and was much celebrated for bis proficiency
with the pea-shooter.
In Melbourne there’s a rumour that some luoky
man has won a most aesthetic, promising, and pretty
prima-donna. We don't say, though, for a moment that
the gossip i* gospel. Though this we write down with
a sign— ** We're not the least bit in it.”
Major Harry Albert Atkinson, the present
Colonial Treasurer of N.Z , and leader of the Lower
House of that colony, is perhaps the ablest financier in
the N.Z. Parliament. Ho is a deliberate, forcible
speaker, powerful in debate, and keen in ridicule. He
may be said to be the corner-stone of the present N.Z.
Ministry. His greatest quality is “ bounce; ” so much
so, that be would have made a wonderful Old Bailey
lawyer. Tot he has great tact, and can wheedle the
most incorrigible round to his views.
Mr. Julian Salomons, Q.C., will not appear on
either side in the slander action, Davies v. Hama. It’s
quite likely that Mr. Salomons, for many and obvious
reasons, doesn’t particularly care about being mixed
up with the case at all—at any rate, he is understood,
despite the most urgent entreaties on the part of
Mr. Davies' friends that he should accept a brief for
the C.M.G., to have pleaded that the fact v- t hie holding
a general retainer for the Corporation places him in a
position of some delicacy with respect to appearing on
behalf of one alderman against another in this special
instance.
A correspondent draws attention to a par.
published by us the other day. Col. Fitzroy, the
dashing blonde of Adelaide, who has recently gone
borne, is, he says, a son of Lord Charles, one or the
sons of the Duke of Grafton. While at school he fell a
conquest to his present wife, whom lie married ont of
bravado, because his schoolfellows taunted him to the
effect that he “wasn’t game to." “ Family lawyers,"
continues our correspondent, “ tried for years to trip
her, but without avail, and the present charge of
bigamy is apparently groundless. She has ran him
into tremendous debts, bat intends becoming a duchess
and has trimmed her sails accordingly."
Ingham Bell, the young man who shot his father
at Bundaberg (Q.), the other day, has been sentenced
to four years* imprisonment for manslaughter. The
father was a very old Bundaberg settler. Years ago he
married an aboriginal native of N.8.W., by whom he
has a large family. Ingham Bell is a son of Mr. Bell’s
first wile, a white woman. He has lived in Sydney for
a number of years, and recently returned, with his wife
to Bundaberg. Some time ago, the parricide was
brought up at the local Police Couit, charged with
brutally beating a black gin, and was fined.
A colonial divorce case of interest was recently
tried in London. J. W. .Reeve, who petitioned for a
dissolution on the ground of adultery, was a well-
known engineer, and contractor for the Tasmanian
Railway some years ago, and he married Miss Roope in
Hobart, in 1873, In defence, Mrs. Reeve denied the
charge against her, and charged her husband with
cruelty. The co-reepondent was Dr. Scott, of Exeter.
The peculiarity of the case was, that nothing was
proved on either side, and the petition was dismissed.
The result caused great surprise in Hobart, where the
parties are known, and to which place Mrs. Reeve is
again coming, to join her relatives.
The Wide Bat and Burnett News, and the
Maryborough Chronicle have had a row, and at pre-
sent the affairs of the universe are in a state of chaos in
consequence. It seems a Professor Gilbert laotured in
Maryborough (poor fellow I), and while the W.B. and
B.N. gave him a show, the M.C. ignored him. The
Chronicle in Its next issue scorches Its rival with the
remark; “We must express our surprise that re-
speotable journals In this district and in the South
should have allowed members of their staffs to be
inveighed (sic) by this designing quack into hushing up
the nefarious obscenities which we deem it our duty to
refer to in this manner, and hope, for the sake of public
morality, that the police and the press will, in future,
be more vigilant." To which the other rag replies in
an exceedingly happy manner as follows" We will at
once accept the position that the allusion as to the re-
spectable journals in this district is intended for ns.
Indeed, as this is the only respectable paper in the dis-
trict, we have no other alternative." In the meantime
the Professor is humping his drum on to the next
township, quite unconscious that his little “ pitch " has
caused such thunder in the air.

THE DEATH-ADDER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BY D.
We were returning from the funeral of a lady
whose tragic death shocked the people of this city not
long ago. It was dark before we began the home journey,
and this oast an additional gloom over our thoughts.
The white houses on each side of ns looked, as we flitted
silently by them, like rows of sepulchres, and the lamps
shone like fiery plumes on hearses driven by devils down
the road to helf. I was in the same coach as the hus-
band of the deceased. There were no other occupants.
As he had said nothing since we left the burial-ground,
I thought ho was brooding over hie grief too much, and
said a word or two of consolation to him by way of
drawing him out of the shadow of death for a moment.
When I sympathised with his “natural sorrow at the
sudden and dreadful end of a young and beautiful wife,”
he smilsd so strangely that I began te fear he was going
insane. He seemed to notice this, and smiled again—
this time with such grotesque cheerfulness that it was
all I could do to keep myself from laughing aloud.
Then we relapsed into silence once more,
" Keep your spirits up," I remarked, encouragingly,
as we reached our destination. “ Ton are not yet a
broken man by half."
“ My other half being under the sod I suppose ? ” he
replied with the same dubious smile, and then added
ominously, “ after all, there is only one thing in life
worth living for."
“ Which is? "
“ Death."
• • •
The next time I saw this man he was on his
death-bed. He had sent for me, though I was an
almost total stranger to him, to give the secret of his
life into my keeping. His face looked so ghastly in the
dim light of the sick chamber that the fancy seised me
for a moment that it was not his at all, but the face of
Death, who had carried him away and lain down in his
place to laugh noiselessly at the solemn-eyed attendants
whose shadows, as they crept round the room, bowed
and wavered and flickered about like evil spirits dancing
the dance of the Seven Deadly Sins. After a few
minutes they left the room, and the sick man and I were
alone together. Then, as,one to whom every moment
is precious, he began rapidly to explain to me that,
though it might seem strange that he should select a
person whom he bad only seen once before to make a
confidant of, yet he was convinced he had chosen
rightly. He said he could not leave the world without
confessing his sin to somebody, and authorised me to
make the confession public after he was dead. Here it
is—
* • •
“ lam a murderer. It was I who killed my wife.
Nobody ever suspected me. I am considered a good
citizen, and a pillar of the church, by everybody who
knows me. I have gone about with a smile, while this
terrible secret has been burning my heart out. But it
was at night, when I was alone with my guilty soul, and
the lamp shining on my out-stretched blood-stained
hands took colour from them, and flooded the room
with a sanguine glare, that I shuddered and wished 1
had never been born. Yet it was not all my fault. The
beautiful creature I married was a fiend. Slowly we
grew to hate each other, though the forma of love were
still kept up. At night, when her arm has crept car-
essingly round my neck, 1 have trembled lest she
should be trying to strangle me. I resolved to be be-
fore-hand with her. So one day I went to a surgical
instrument maker, and got him to make for me a hypo-
dermic syringe, with two injecting points about less
than half an inch apart. The marks left by this
correspond exactly with the impression left by the bite
of the death-adder. I'hen I got a drachm of morphia
in solution. All I wanted now was a death-adder. For
months I was like Satan, going up and down the earth,
and to and fro upon it, searching for this species of
reptile. At last 1 found it.
• • •
“ Even nojv, lone after the deed,” continued the
dying man, with a fierce gleam in his eye, “ and not-
withstanding all the remorse I have suffered since it
was committed, I cannot speak of it without feeling
something of the mad joy which I felt that bright
morning, when, having fallen across the adder in the
busk and killed it, I brought it home, where I found my
wife fast asleep. She had not yet risen, and one of her
white round arms was spread wantonly upon the pillow,
making a frame of ivory for the little head crowned
with night-black hair, a look of which was once worth
more to me than the key of heaven. Her Ups were
half-parted in a happy smile at some deUght she saw in
her morning dream. Slowly I took the syringe out
and poured in the morphia. And, as I thought
how charming she would look stretched out
in her coffin with her fine hands clasped together and
lilies on each side of her, it seemed to me that I would
like to kill all the women in the world, one after the
other, if they were as beautiful as she. With a struggle
I at last shook myself away from my epicurean contem-
plation, and injected the solution of morphia into her
arm, just where the blue veins showed, like the blue
sky through white clouds, through the white and
dainty flesh. The poison crept through her body; she—
well, she slept to death. I then put the dead death-
adder on her breast, with the upper part of its body
coiling round her arm and the head just touching the
red fang-marks thereon, after which I raised a great
cry, and the neighbours rushed in and found me lying
flat on my face in an apparent swoon. The case was
clear. The adder had bitten my wife to death, and I
bad killed it and fainted with grief afterwards. The
rest yon know. But, standing by the grave that day
when first I met you, I prayed that each clod that fell
on the coffin of the woman who had been bone of my
bone and flesh of my flesh would drive her down to the
nadir of nothingness, and that the shadow of her evil
soul should cross the pathway of my existence never-
more. But it may not be. lam dying, and I feel that
she is waiting for me on the threshold of the life to
come. I shall be a murderer once again."
• * •
The morning sunlight streamed into the room,
and danced cynically around the features of this one of
the thousand dead whose ghosts bad gone out shivering
into the dreadful night. The lamp was still burning
dimly upon the table. A nameless horror came over
me as I sat there looking into the glazed eyes of
what was once a living man. I thought I saw
the life of decomposition setting in, and a fright-
ful soul of decay being generated under my very
eyes. And the kingdoms of the dead were made visible
to me with all their countless myriads of inhabitants,
till the living seemed a lonely handful hemmed in by
them and being slowly swallowed up and gathered into
the darkness. I rushed out into the morning air, and in
the bustle and traffic of the city tried to Forget these
phantoms of the night. That day an obituary notice
of the deceased appeared in the daily papers, from
which it appeared that he was a model husband, an
ideal citizen, and a very phoenix of fathers. The in-
scription on the headstone over the grave confirms this
good report, while everyone who knew him swears to
his exactitude. And yet there is his dying confession 1
Was he a murderer or a maniac f

one will be admitted to membership without a certifi-
cate that be has passed the Oxford or Cambridge
Senior or Junior Local, or the London University
matriculation, or some equivalent examination, and
all certificates must include both Latin and mathe-
matios. The final test is, that each candidate must
pass an ordeal of actual note.taking in court. Socially,
a professional shorthand writer in England ranks on a
par with a lawyer, and a first-class “flying pen”
makes an income of four figures. Some earn three or
four thousand a-year.

The House-Furnishing Guide, issued by Messrs.
Campbell Bros., of tho Koyal Furnishing Arcade, has
proved a very acceptable publication. Generally speak-
ing, people set about furnishing with but little
experience in the matter. Messrs. Campbell Bros.’
7urnishing Guide affords bona fide information,
people to furnish completely, elegantly, and
Theatrical Bohemianism.
Is it possible for a man or a woman to adopt
the (Stage as hie or her profession and preserve in
other affairs of life a complexion which shall not
smack of the tinsel and mock heroics of that
business f Many of the old serious objections
against histrions have vanished. Comedians are
no longer considered vagabonds. The stage is an
acknowledged institution, and its professors are,
or should be, worthy the esteem of all sections of
the community. It is trite and of no real value
to say that the Puritans produced strollers, for
astrologists preceded astronomers, as alchemists
preceded scientists. Yet the social standing of
modern astronomers, physicists, and chemists,
has nowise suffered sequentially. So much can-
not be said for the interesting class under review.
Disguise it as we may, ordinary landlords prefer
to deal with ordinary ratepayers rather than with
ordinary actors. The fact that theatrical work
keeps its professors out late at night cannot
surely account for the existence of so solid a pre-
judice. Doctors, for instance, are often out later
at night than are actors, yet what agent
ever doubts as to the propriety of
letting a house to a medical man ? Nor will the
presence of a purse-proud, vulgar lessee justify
any suspicion regarding men and women who toil
for him. Apply the same characteristics to a
bank manager, as, without malice, we may often
do ; yet who would, generally speaking, think
less of that bank manager's clerks P That the
feeling indicated with reference to the dramatic
profession does really exist ie indisputable. That
it exists, however, as a remnant of puritanical
prejudices, cannot now be assumed. That it
exists as a condition of their calling is untrue.
That its existence ie inseparable from the exlsteaoe
of aotors and actresses is a statement self-refuted,
unworthy toleration, yet too often addaced as an
apology for social shortcomings. In this latter
connection it takes the cabalistic form
Bohemianism.
• • #
If men and women outside the dramatic pro-
fession were to adduce any such reason for
offences against good taste and social usages, the
plea would be instantly and properly disallowed.
Bohemianism covers a multitude of cine—merely
raises sentimental dust, disguised by which re-
sponsibility for outrt, and pernaps inexcusable, ac-
tions is avoided. It is, after ail, merely an appeal
ad misericord!am, unjustifiably made, and, in nine
cases out of ten, indolently assented to. Why
should not theatrical performers when off the
«tage deport themselves after the fashion ot
ordinary men and women P Why should these
latter hesitate about associating with those former
on terms of equality and intimacy P Of course,
every profession permanently influences the
mental, moral, and physical condition of its
votaries. Yet iu ordinary eases such an influence
is not a preternaturaily absorbing one a
maelstrom, which engulpfcs man’y of the attributes
whereby ladiee and gentlemen are distinguished
from feminine and masculine cads. It remains
no really eufficient reason in the abetraot.
• # *
There may be one thing in connection with the
histrionic craft which differentiates it and other
pursuits. Let this claim be clearly specified.
Actors and actresses ply the active portion of
their trade directly under the eyes of » large and
often nndiscriminating audience, who having paid
an admission-fee have a perfect right to applaud
or contemn in a marked manner. This faot, on
eonaideration, may favour the plea of “Bohe-
mianism " more than others which are frequently
advanced. Constant work under the stare of a
thousand pair of eyes, and in the glare of gas-light,
points in the direction of peculiar results, even
with minds above the usual calibre. Perhaps the
only other mortals who follow their calling in so
public a way are parsons ; and parsons, as we
know, form a distinct genus, and possess the
strangest ideas on the subject of their relative
importance among human beings.
« * •
We are not seldom told that aotors live in
another world, are continual factors in imaginative
scenes, and incessantly represent existence as it is
found nowhere beyond the stage. But all artists
are so situated. Both writers and painters live in
imaginative worlds ; and, if this be allowed
sufficient, may also urge exemption from the
recognised amenities of citizenship. Their demand
for such exemption would, in addition, be more
reasonable, seeing that they are creators, while
histrions are but elucidators and dealers at
second-hand in other men’s ideas. A sounder
reason for what is termed Bohemianism, or,
rather, falsely allowed as Bohemianism having
regard to Thespians, may now be stated. Num-
bers of illiterate and underbred people as members
of the dramatic profession occupy positions
which, socially, cannot be approximately
equivalented. In other words, many actors and
actresses possess talents for the stage, but
are destitute of manners or education
sufficient to fit them for a parallel
social status. We may add that until the pro-
fession is openly allowed as honourable a large
percentage of its members will always be thus
unfortunately circumstanced. Speaking gene-
rally, it is only of late years that ladies and
gentlemen havs looked on the Theatre as a
legitimate and even decent mode of obtaining a
livelihood or as a means of approaching and
pursuing a worthy career. The educated pro-
fessional actor is of greater value to his manager
than the uncultured professional. If admis-
sion to the practice of stage-life were based on
proper examinations and the issue of degrees in
liberal arts as in the ease with recognized profes-
sions—if the theatrical profession were, in fact,
more equal with other professions, multitudes of
scholarly and high-bred candidates would instantly
come forward wao will now be never hoard of in
connection with matters theatrical. Time will
eventually break down the remaining barriers of
prejudice and Governmental inattention and the
dramatic profession no longer form a refuge for
thousands who bring discredit on what should be
a very noble and literate occupation.
* * •
Till such a oensummation, we are afraid that
with reference to three-fourths of theatrical pro-
fessionals much hesitancy will continue among
ordinary respectable people when the question
arises whether this or that “ Bohemian ” shall be
received and treated as a social compeer.

Miss Emelie Melville has written us a duck of a
letter surmounted by an elegant red monogram, which
not only contains two-thirds of the letters in the
English alphabet, but the counterfeit presentment of
an owl also. Our fair correspondent states that she
has secured the services—we will quote her—of * Beau-
mont, Earley, and Casseli (who is the bsst comedian
you have ever had here), John Ford, Misses St. Clair,
Miss Ida Osborne, and others whom I am
arranging with ; a chorus of thirty good voices.” Miss
Melville also states that she has been badly treated by
“the firm,” while the firm stale they have been badly
treated by Emelie. Miss Melville says that Messrs.
Williamson and Co. “insisted on only playing the
oldest operas," but on the other hand Mr. Williamson
—well, says something else. Complications are in-
creased by an avowed determination on part of Miss
M. to play the “Mascotte" on her arrival here in
October, while Messrs. W., G. and M. assert that they
have purchased the exclusive Australian right both to
Farnie’s libretto and to the music. It will, therefore,
bo seen that there are lively old times looming ahead —
that i* if they don’t kiss and make friends before the
battle wages. We shall bo delighted to welcome
Emelie, anyhow; and if she’ll do the making friends,
we ll do the—Coming, Martha.
* * *
The Mastodons have drawn a bigger biz. than has ever
been known at the Yictorieral. It is not too much to say
that thay have completely taken the starch out (pecu-
niarily) of the “crumpled roaebud ” opposition, and
hold tbair audiences in shrieking amazemant nightly.
There is a legend that Billy Wilson, being finished
early, walked round to the Gaiety, the other night, and
swallowed Walter Reynolds. It is on record, however,
that, hie attention being called to the circumstance by
a by-stander, ho immediately rendered back Walter to
his small bnt affectionate familv. “Come and tee ns
and be happy,” says their ad. We went to see them and
were exoe«iißgly joyous. Little Abrahams—otherwise
Mr. Hetty Croucber—ls on the door; and Wolfe, in a
ten-guinea smoking-cap, is on hand to make np the
house aad kill oomntry editors. Some of the farces of
the Mastodoas are very funny. One in which Billy
Wilson strives fruitlessly to break Hosea Easton’s head
with a brick is sublime. We recommend this farce to
all rellgiouely-dispossd persons. It is awfully like what
occurs in the second book of Kings. The odour, how-
ever, is still high.
** * *
And talking of the Gaiety, Frank Towers opens
with Pomeroy there on Louise—and this is
what ws clutch at I —brings with her Bill Holloway,
Q. P. Carey (the Native of the Sydney Female), Sam
Pools, and several others, with Frank Weston as
manager. We understand that Miss P. is to play
"Hamlet" daring her season, and as a good deal of
curiosity has been evinced with regard to —[A passage
hers which is not legitimate dramatic criticism, has
been struck out by order of the editsr.—Printer] Any-
how, Louise is certain to draw a crowded house in that
character, and we trust that her pecuniary success will
be only equalled by her anatomical triumph. Louise,
by the way, we hear is studying “ The Doge of Venice."
It will be interesting to see her—yon know our lisp
walk over the Bridge of Thighs.
** * *
Eignold’s “ ben.” is oh Friday (to-morrow), and
in connection with this event we may state that we have
received a communication (we are just reminded of it)
from a gilded youth re Miss Roland Watts-Phillips.
“ I send you," he says, “ her biography." “ Miss Watts-
Phillips is the daughter of Mr. Watts-Phillips, the
author of many successful dramas played at the Adelphi
Theatre She was requested before leaving England to
play before the Prince and Princess of Wales at Sand-
ringham.” Ibis is the kind of biography we adore,
and, therefore, we readily print it. If it were a bit
shorter, we would print more of it.
** * *
As we write' this, we drop a tear which blisters
the baek of the grocery account. Before ns is an
announcement of “ the last two nights of the Clark and
Ryman’s Minstrels." Tom Saysr?, Esq., would seem
to have seceded from the company. He drew £4O for
two weeks, and then, we snppose, travelled up to buy a
station on the Darling. Sam Dearin’s benefit is en
Friday (to-morrow), and wo hope he will have a good
one. We respect Sam, because he seems to be able to
bring music ont of anything. We intend to kill a
Baptist preacher, shortly, and if he can bring music out
of that, we will crown him with a wreath of Evukooze
poetry.

Miss Theresa Horan recently had a benefit in

The Mastodons at the Yictorieral —a thousand
pardons 1 the Cademy o’ Moosic —are about to produce
a s etch, freely and easily adapted from the “ Pirates of
Penzance,” entitled “1 he Pashas of Pensunkles : An
Egyptian Hopera Buffer,” iu which Billy Wilson will
enact the part of Mabel 1 The bombardment of Alex-
andria will conclude this classic spectacle.
** * *
George E. Sims’ “ Eomany Eye,” wo are told
(which is a disappointment), is a spectacu'ar success,
and a literary failure; but his “ Wi-« Child” appears
to be a yell throughout, though some of the allusions
would seem to be just the very least hit giddy. This
is very good. But what is of more importance is that
we have received a letter from Mr. Arthur Vivian,
dated from the Royal Hotel, Maryborough, in which he
states that the company in Gympie had to wash in beer
—water being so scarce—and clean their teeth with
kerosene. The success of the Clara (sweet Clara I)
Stephenson com bination appears to have been electrical,
and Arthur (as we understand) got the town as Rosen-
crantz, and subsequently electrified it as one of the
“ two citizens meeting." Arthur is kind enough to send
us the missis's kind regards, which we are afraid to
divide for fear of having a row in the office.
** * *
Mr. Bichard K. Fox, who runs a paper in New
York, seems to hit it indifferently with the perfesh.
Learning that the Jersey Lily is about to “ star " in
America, he says:—“ And then at out that old ruin, the
Langtry woman, whom he is going to import. How
deftly and aiguiftcaatiy tha reporter makes Abbey werk
in the fact that «ho ia going to leave her husband
home to give the * mashera ’ on thia aide a chance to
go broke." Then he says that Fanny Davenport, who
atatea through tha Pres* that the la raatiagln England,
ia, with other "atara,” “hidiag away in cheap
boarding-houses, and allowing the public to enjoy the
delnsieu that they are jpuniag health and onltnre for
ihe next season.” To Mary Anderson he is
equnlly disrespectful. “ Her; guardian, old Ham.
Qr.ffiu," he says, " is flapping his huge ears at the poor
girl b shoulder. Poor thing 1 No wonder she tnrows
away her toys and refuses to be comforted. She wants
a doll—a male one—with real eyes that roll, and real
hair parted in the middle.” Mr. John Stetson, whom
we really respected as the proprietor (if not the author)
of that classical drama, “ Neck and Neck,” Mr. Pox
characterises as " the very arch apostle of dramatic
flith.” Bat the manner in which he chronicles the
collapse of a well-known opera company it perhaps the
most heartless thing wo have read since we perntei the
account of the lowtrinjr down of Je-M«ph. Here it
is “ Last April Alice Gated* opera eotnpemy went to
pieces in Bay City, Michigan. The remnants of the
company are in the town still, nnakle to either walk
oat or to raise funds to ride out. A baritone is engaged
in piling lumber in a saw-mlll, a tenor is touter fora
cheap clothing store, and a contralto slings hash as a
waiter girl in a dining room ef the principal hotel.
Alice will probably be poisoned if she ever tries to play
in Bay City again and steps at the hasbery.” A calm
perusal of this leads ns to the conclusion that R. K.
P. mnet keep his own supply of libel-case jurymen en
hand, and has specially engaged the serricee of all the
most accomplished foremen.
** * *
Adelaide theatrical news is a bit flat this week.
Onr correspondent Informs ns that the performance of
“ Der Preisohutz ” by the Simoneen Company was
“ ludicrously ineffective." That is a question of
crackers. Martin used to get 1 hem here for something
like threepence a hundredweight. The same Company
have ventured on staging an American versiea of
Yon Suppe’s " Boccaccio, and they dirt it in sueh a
phenomenally curious style that even Dexter Smith,
the writer of the fearful libretto, would have been hurt
if he had witnessed it We shall wade through this
libretto one of these days when wo want to get mad. It
seems that Dunning and Wallace own Australian
rights in the English edition. We would, judging by
the American version, just as soon be sole proprietor of
a license for rag gathering. Wybert Reeve opened this
week in the *' Crushed Tragedian."
** * *
Mr. Frank Towers returned from Melbourne on
Wednesday, having completed bis arrangements for the
opening of the Gaiety Theatre on the 21st instant, with
the Rosa Towers Comedy Company. The young lady
who heads the bill will be remembered here as a
phenomenal child, but reports say that she has developed
into a remarkably clever actress. Miss Towers will be
supported by *‘ a company of exceptional ability," as will
be seen when we name Mr. Frank Towers, Mr. Prank
Cates, Mr. G. E Ireland, Mr. J. H. Rainford, Mr. T.
Bsciley, and Misses Nellie Playfair and May Vivian,
and Mrs. Stammers, and others.
** * *
If the London Figaro goes on like this,
it will get itself disliked. Listen:—‘lt appears,”
says this vandal journal, "that in Sydney a sequel to
‘Patience’ has been written by Mr. Thomas Meses
(sic), a local journalist. If the specimen printed by
The Bulletin be a fair sample of the rest, we ar# not
likely soon to have this precious work iu England."
We are naturally indignant at this flippant notice of
what will, in all probability, be an immortal work.
“ Mr. Thomas Moses ” indeed ! But this affectation of
not knowing a genius whose fame as a librettist has
extended from barber’s polo to barber’s vole, is con.
temptlbls. Theoretically, for this insult to one of our
most cherished colonial litterateur* wsspltat our grovel-
ling contemporary. And this is all we can do—being a bit
late going to press—for Mr. Moser in this issue.
** * *
The great “J.C.” is a nice man. He keeps it
in a cupboard at the office. There are rows of clouded
bottlee of inviting appearance in thst mystic sanctum,
and a gln-cass nndsr the table full of " ginger ale "
(what ia ginger ale?) and soda-water fer the Good
Templars. Wi knocked nervously at the door, the
other night, when the great man was “ in bis connting-
hsuse, oouating ont hTs money,” In answer to the
snmmens with onr knuckles, he looked out, and said:
"No, my good manj I don't want aay fish this svsn-
j inf." ,f W#don’t sell fish," ws replied, with a curl of
! the upper lip. “ Then it's bottles,” he eald; " I don’t
« buy them, either." “ Bat ws sre on the Press," we
1 gently stated. "Oh, come in,” he raid then, with a
genial smile; and then he musically murmured to
; Goodie to run round to the ham-and-beef shop. Having
; been regaled In a fitting manner, and, having borrowed
a basket from the management in which to bear away
i the fragments, we took a bite off Goodie’s plug and
I gave an sar to the oracle.

For the information of a few million of
damask-cheeked and bine-eyed readers, ws may state
that Mr. Williamses is a gentleman with a face of such
Cupid.like appsarasse, that every known painter has
offered him huge subsidies to sit ss the God of Love,
, sipping heusy from a rose-bud. "We produce," said
I Mr. W,, with a pleasant inflexion of voice, end in
simple sentences framed so ss to come within tbs in-
tellectual esmpass of a reporter, *• • Patisne#.' on
Saturday, with Nellis Stewart as the Dairy Maid,
and Madame Navaro as Lady Jans—the cast, with a few
modifications, being very much the same as befere
And after ‘Patienee’ ‘the Mascette,’ Maggie Moore,
whom you hare perhaps heard of ” "Neverl ”we
interjected. He then rose leisurely, and opening a enp-
board took oot a club. All of a sudden, then, we remem-
bered her. " Maggie Moore," he resumed, twlrlirg the
truncheon in a skilful nianher, " will play the title
role; the new tenor, Woodfleld—a coming Metropoli-
tan maaher—will do Hippo ; and there T 1 bs Harwood,
Ned Kslly.jVerdi, and sixty in the chorus.' “ And after
■ the 1 Mascotte ?”* we queried, in a voice rendered husky
by German sausage. "The pantomime," he said.
" Nellie Stewart is to play the boy-part, and I have im-
ported an author expressly to do the locals and songs.
He is daily expected, and after he is washed on arrival
—the process being superintended by Goodie—he will
be duly inducted into the political situation. The
titleof the pantomime will either be " The House that
Jack bailt,* ‘Little Boy Blue,' ‘Pixie Paraiin,’
‘Blue Beard,’ "Aladdin,’ ‘or the Old Woman who
Lived in a Shoe.' ” We humbly thanked John Stofel for
allowing ns to be beforehand with our contemporaries
in this announcement. And then having borrowed our
omnibus fare from the management, we majestically
left.

Another big thing—this time on wheels. Mr.
Seymour, a gentleman with a life-guard’s moustache
and a smile as broad as a tea-cup, is inaugurating a
bicycle tournament at the Exhibition Building. The
contest will last seven days, and prizes to the value of
£135 will be given. The entrance-fee will be a pound
to the Champion Race —sobriety of the competitor
indispensable ; and we suppose that the riders will be
clad in chaste and appropriate attire. There is a kid
in the show named Roife, who rides “ the greatest
bicycle ever known j” and ginger-beer will be on sale
in the hall at threepence a bottle. There is millions
in this show. We intend to contract for picking up
the waste corks, and snavelling the heels of the sand-
wiches.

Donizetti’s opera suits the principals well; but
perhaps the best thing they will do will be the “ Lily
of Killarney” on Saturday. Mr. Turner and his wife
are both great artistes ; but they are not the whole of
an opera. Neither is Patti, who is getting £lOOO a
night, nor N ilsson, who scoops in £4OO.

Yet one more letter from the gifted George.
He says he intended to have played at Cape Tewn—
presumably in an entirely original drama,—but was
prevented by the amall-pox epidemic This will be sad
news for the Cape Town people; very oad news Indeed
However, while the sorrow i« their* the joy is ours, for
the gifted actor-author aiguilles that he will produce

young Mr. Sara Bernhardt can’t stand Damala, at any

youngster pacned off, and she and Damala could enjoy
their morning hot roll and bloater without fear of a row
to interrupt the entente cordiale, than “ the villain still
pursued her." It would appear that Damala came to

her as a member of har company. Well, in this com-
pany was also a Madelle. Minelli, to whom, prior to
freezing on to the divine Sara, Damala made honour-
able proposals. But directly Mdelle. Bernhardt gave
him ene night, in an oyster saloon, after the show, the

wrote her a letter, in which was the following passage:
—** Tn es ma femme devant Dieu. Bientot, j’espoie, tu
seras ma femme devant les hommes;" a passage in tho
Muscevitisk tongue which may be liberally translated:
—*• You are my wife before heaven; I hope soon you

to give Mr, Sara a showing up. The action is pending

Mr. Alfred Roberts.
The name most prominently associated with the
success of the Prince Alfred Hospital movement
is that of Mr. Alfred Roberts. The history of
this institution, from the time of its inception,
when a cowardly attempt was made on the
life of H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh, down to
the auspicious opening, a few days ago, exhibits
unflagging energy and remarkably disinterested
services on the part of this gentleman. Nor, in
respect of this institution alone is it that the pub-
lic are indebted to him. Mr. Roberts has been a
consistent champion of hospital reform, and has
effected much good in this direction all over the
colony. He has lent valued professional aid at
times of serious crises—his services in every way
justifying the reputation, as a surgeon and other-
wise, he enjoys to-day. Mr. Roberts is a son of
Mr. John Roberts, surgeon, and was bom at
his father’s residence, Finsbury Circus, London.
He was educated at St. Paul’s School, and studied
for »ix years at Guy’s Hospital, when his health
failed and he took a yachting cruise for twelve
months. Returning to England, he settled at
Eye, and married ; but, after a few years’ prac-
tice, ill-health again compelled him to travel, and,
coming te Australia, he was induced to remain in
Sj dney. At the invitation of the medical staff of
the Sydney Infirmary, he accepted a position as
honorary surgeon. This post Mr. Roberta
held for eighteen years, at the expiration of
which ho was elected honorary consulting surgeon.
For a considerable period Mr. Roberts represented
the Surgical Staff at the Board of Directors, and
the experience gained by him during his connec-
tion with the institution impelled him, about
seventeen years ago, to endeavour to get the main
bnilding of the Infirmary gutted and restored, or
rebuilt, as the only means of obviating the danger
of “ hospitalism." The foundations of the struo-
ture would not admit of this improvement; be-
sides, it was found that the site had never been
formally transferred to the directors. When the
Duke of Edinburgh was recovering from his
wound, it occurred to Mr. Roberts that the loyal
feeling of the colonists might find a most appro-
priate outlet in raising a permanent memorial
hospital, and that it might be erected on the site
of the Sydney Infirmary. Many well-known
citizens heartily endorsed the idea, and actively
co-operated in the project, with the result that
the first meeting was a great success. Sydney
and the colony generally were in a very depressed
state at the time, and it was thought by many im-
possible to raise more than .£7OOO. In a few
weeks, no less a sum than .£20,000 had been sub-
scribed. This amount was offered to the directoi a
of the Infirmary, and at first accepted, but it wsa
finally declined in October, 1870. After much
difficulty, and through the liberality of the Senate
of the University and the Government, the present
site of Prince Alfred Hospital was secured for the
, memorial. At this period, Mr. Roberts was com-
pelled to seek change and rest, and he resolved on
visiting England and the various centres cf
Europe—to enlarge his professional experience,
to study improvements in the arohitectuie and
organisation of hospitals and lunatic asylums,
and to make himself thoroughly acquainted wii h
the working of the various Contagions Diaeasi a
Acts. Upon returning to his practice in Sydney,
he submitted his notes to his colleagues, the
Directors of the Prince Alfred Hospital, and he
has in the capacity of their hon. see., worked
with them to render it worthy of the colony and
its high object. Since his return, Mr. Roberts
has also recommended designs for the new hos-
pitals at Mndgee and Glen Innes, and prepared a
full and valuable statistical report of the
hospitals of N. S. W., Victoria, Queensland, South
Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. This
report entailed great labour, and its production,
recognized by all the Governments of the
colonies and the profession, is a testimony to tlo
untiring industry of its compiler. When the late
epidemic of small-pox assumed a serious aspect,
the Government offered Mr. Roberts the position
of executive member of the Board of Health, for
the purpose of organizing a system by which the
disease should, if possible, be stamped out. It is
known that this undertaking, with the most cor die I
assistance of other professional men, and the
00-operation of the Government, was completely
successful a result, as already observer,
which was thought absolutely impossible by the
medical men of England. Mr. Roberta has for
many jeers held the position of President of me
Boerd of Visitors of Hospitals for the Insane,
and was hon. surgeon to tne Destitute Children’s
Asylum when it was located at Paddington. With
the assistance of Sir William Denison, he planned
the scheme upon which the present Rand-
wick Asylum was designed. Mr. Roberts has for
many years been a trustee of the Australian
Museum, and was one of the committee of three
who organised the Industrial Museum destroyed by
the recent fire at the Garden Palace,

Some time ago a person advertised in
Sydney furnished rooms to let, with "Chris-
tians preferred ” in the ad. as a warning to the
ungodly not to apply. In due course a Christian
called, bringing with him a Gladstone bag and
a very large Bible. He was aeoepted and in-
stalled. His quarters consisted of half the
bed-room occupied by another Christian, who
had arrived a few days previously, bringing as
credentials a letter of a clergyman in Seringa-
patam, and as luggage a tin travelling ease of
bulbous appearance. One night the new’lodger
presented the family with tickets for a temper,
anoe entertainment, and humbly proposed to
escort them in person. The family were de-
lighted. So they all started together, the new
lodger with the lady of the house and her bus-
band with the only daughter—all so nice and
genteel that the neighbours quite envied them,

evening, about 10, when the good young man
suddenly discovers that both his bag and the
other Christian have disappeared. This dis-
covery is succeeded by a yell from the land-
lard that his cashbox has gone, while with a
piercing scream his wife opens her wardrobe
and exposes to view a beggarly row of unoccu-
pied hooks. The police are summoned the next
morning by tho landlord, and, on being ao-
qnainted with the facts, enquire casually for

Last week Mr. Chapman gave an elocutionary
entertainment in the Woollahra sohool-room. The
programme consisted of a choice selection of only
eighteen pieces. A man sat down at the commencement.
and after an hour he was oalled out to attend the
death-ked of hia motker-in-law. After watching her
breathe her last, and bearing away tearfully as a keep-
sake what small change there was lying about, he re-
turned to the school-room. Chapman was still eloont-
ing. Half-an .hour elapsing, he went out for a drink,
and, an alarm of fire being given, he strolled over to
Ultimo to have a loek at it. Having helped to put out
the " disastrous conflagration, ’’ be had a light supper
and went back to the entertainment. Chapman was
still declaiming. After listening with great enjoyment
to the “ Eaven,” the spectator slipped out, and, taking
a cab to Balmain, got his ulster, a pair of slippers, and a
pillow. Then he returned. Chapman was still in full
blast. On this ho lay down, and awoke when the silver
grey of dawn was faintly glimmering in the air, and the
first sound that met his ear was : “ To be or not to be,
that is the question." Then ho died.

The journal for which the world panted is before
us. It consists of eight paves et three small columns
each, and is called the Australian Exchange and
Mart. The paper has many peculiar points j— for
instance, although wo have before us the Arst number,
we see that 't contains several “Answers to Corres-
pondents ” For example, one “Jean la Questionneur"
(sic) is told that “ Ava feet two inches would be con-
sidered rather short for a man;" and “Sit Roger do
Coverly" (sio), “None but the brave deoeeve the fair." n
We glean, also, from the pages of this journal that “a I
gentleman 25 years of ago, recently from ’Frisco, is J
desirous of meeting with a yossg lady of 80 to 25, with
a view to matrimony; photos, exohnnged;" and it
seams that “ a lady " wants to exchange her riding-
habit (dark green, and made by a leading tailor) for an
accordeon (I) We are glad the paper’s come out, for we
have a lot of things we wiqt to get rid of. The first
thing, however, that we will take either an oyster-shell
grotto or a mule for, is our copy of the Exchange and
Mart. The published price of the E. and M. is 3d. , and
we should say it the proprietors persevere, it will soon
attain a circulation of several copies.

There is a little moral stor
in a late issue of the Presbyterian
about a boy who " got a going and
couldn't stop." He was a very
wicked boy, and his father didn't
subscriba to the religious papers.
The first step on the way to the
gallows was made when he went
out to Botany with some other
boys and got drunk. The reverend
scribe who wrote the story forgot to
mention that he (the boy, not the
scribe this time) got drunk on
Presbyterian whisky. This is
enough to briag anyone but a
sectarian scribbler into an un-
hallowed grave. We knew another
boy who ** got a going " also. He
used to deliver a religious journal
at the house next door to where we
lived one time. One day he cleaned
out the umbrella-stand and hat-
raok. Then he get a going. He
has stopped since—in gaol.
“It is pleasant,” writes a
correspondent, 14 to witness the
fraternal friendship which exists
between the boarders and the day-
scholars of a big college in a Syd-
ney suburb. Nearly each pair of
chums in the school consists of a
boarder and a day-pupil. And the
mutual love between them is so
strong that the day-scholar iuvari-
ably shares his dinner with the
boarder. The atmosphere of that
college is so invigorating that the
boarders have apparently insatiable
appetites. A large portion of their
pocket-money, even, finds its way
into the till of a neighbouring
baker. Yet the day.scholars who
bring their own dinner with them
don't seem to prefer to bny bread
instead of the ordinary schoolboy’s
treasures. And you never catch
one of them trying to sneak a por-
tion of the collegiate sticky pud-
ding which winds up the daily
dinner served out to the boarders.
Of course, the latter are not half,

Mr. Lackey is not to resign his office as Secre-
tary for Woiks. The announcement has caused some
disappointment among the faithful of the Government
followers. Mr. Cameron, for instance, looked upon
the position as a moral certainty. It is said that it
was arranged that Mr. Jacob should be made Chairman
of Committees, and n man batter qualified for the
tffica does not exist—that is, presuming he is not
nominated for the position by John Darks, whose
sickly smile he seems to court.
Mr. Jacob, in speaking of the petition pre-
sented to the Assembly, asking that trains might not
run o n Sunday, said that he know for a faot that a
person who was asked to sign the document, and who
thought to stagger the old lady who had charge of it,
enquired what wonldibe done with the bodies of dead
people if the Sunday funeral trains were discon-
tinued ? The old woman did the dying-duck-m-a-

Sir Henry Parkea made his re-appearance in
the Assembly on Thursday evening, and, naturally
enough, met with a magnificent reception at the hands
of hie satellites. Some one asked a question to which
the Colonial Secretary had to reply. Mr. Speaker
announced "Sir Henry Parkes” with nnneual
emphasis, the intention being, of course, not to direct
the attention of members to the faot that the mighty
man was about to rise to speak—or, in other words, to
give the “cue” for applause—oh, no! but to remind
the hon. member that a question would be put to him.
The holy holies mustered in great force, and they
started the round of applause which was given.
Vanitt Fair “ ‘ The stain of blood may be

chised Nonconformist, he declared that he could speak
no more on this painful topic (of Blood). He ‘ must
refer the reader to the striking and powerful sermon of
Mr. Spurgeon, preached on the 13th of July, 1879.’

In London, a Mr. Guy got into trouble and lost
a Government billet for an alleged libel on the 60th
regiment. He imputed cowardice to some of its mem-
bers. Yet Archibald Eorbes, in the Nineteenth
Century, boldlv told the story of how Sir Evelyn
Wood, in the Zulu war, had several men severely
flogged for flying in battle. And quite recemtiy Matthew
Arnold gave, in the Fortnightly Review, an account
of the desperate funk which seized some British tioops
at Ghingilhovo. The poor fellows could not hold their
guns straight owing to fear. Yet neither Matthew
Arnold nor Archibald Forbes have been hanged yet.

There has been a universal expression of satis-
faction at the result of Mr. Copeland's motion in favour
of the opening of the Art Gallery on Sunday. The
Svbbatarians did not expect such a crushing defeat;
indeed, a fortnight ago, they anticipated n small
majority on their side. However, the petition presented
by Mr. Copeland could not be ignored by the “doubt-
ful ” men. It would have been a lasting disgrace to
our so-called representative institution if a spontaneous
expression of opinion such as was conveyed in the peti-
tion had not had the desired effect. Forty-one mem-
qers voted for the motion and twenty-four against it;
and it is said authoritatively that 63 out of the 108
promised to vote fer it.
The name of the midshipman who was captured
by Arab! Bey while conveying despatches was Mr. Da
Cnair SailJVANirx Pair on the circumstance " It
semed to be expected that Arahi would put him to
de-th as a pirate, which, according to the Law Of
Nations, he might have done, since the English nation
U not at war with anybody, and the individual English-
men who are committing murder in Egypt are there-
fore amenable to the laws of that country. Mr.
Gladstone is doubtless convinced that an order from
him is sufficient authority for ihe taking of any man’s
life abroad; bat in oonsideiation for the troops that he
is sending out, be onght to give them the protection of
a Declaration of War against eomeboa, or other.
Arahi has got him out of the difficulty as regards Mid-
shipman Do Chair, whom he his sent to Cairo, and
allowed to write to his mother. But suppose the Duke
of Conaanght were taken prisoner ? It would not be
pleasant f r one of the Royal Family to owe his escape
from the gallows to the generoiity of a man who has
been tie«ted as a mere military adventurer.”
The lawyers in Parliament are determined to
convince the public that they are desirous to facilitate
and cheapen proceedings in the law couits. In the
Criminal Law Bill there is a provision copied from the
English law that the judge may order compensation to
be paid to an injured person out of the prisoner’s
estate. Thus if a man maliciously kills another man’s
cattle—and this is said to be a common practice—in
addition to tfce imprisonment to which he is liable for
the offence against the laws, he may be called upon to
pay to the owner of the cattle their value. To one not
acquainted with the mysteries and miseries of a
lawyer’s office, this would stem a reasonable provision;
but the lawyers strove hard I t several hours to con-
vinoe themselves—aa thee could not possibly convince
any one else—that it was not. And why ? Because the
injured person ought to be foned to ett rsdrsss in a
civil oourt —and probably pay more to the lawyers tkan
he would receive. These gentleman are continually
assarting that they are representatives of the people,
and that (heir only oljeot is to promote the public
good. If they could have their way they would do this
with a vengeance. Wo should prefer to entrust out
liberties to a Parliament composed entirely of parsons.
Mr. Purves, the member for Clarence, has not
been breathing the pure alt of the Assembly atmos-
phere during the last three weeks. The Elections Com-
wittee have been ” sitting upon ” him, as the journals
of the House would say, and the incubatory process has
produced a remarkable result. The question referred
to the committee was whether Mr. Purves had, as a
member of the firm of Bait. Rodd, and Purves, entered
into a contract with tbe Government, and derived a
benefit therefrom. The committee report that ho did
enter into a contract, bat did not derive any benefit, as
wh-n he found out the danger in which he was plicing
himself he withdrew from the contract. But it is not
denied that the Arm did the business for the Govern-
meat, and received nearly £h.O cemmiision. Sir
Henry Parkes a&ys that the Government do not intend
to take action on the report, but he did not sn y why. The
reason is that Mr, Purves Is a pronounced Government
supporter. It an auctioneering 11. m, one of the mem-
here of which is an M.P , is to get Government work,
there is the possibility of any amount of corruption, and
the formal withdrawal from the firm—as tar as the
Government business is concerned —of the HP.,
ought ;not to shield him from the previsions of the
Constitution Act. Of course, we are ready to believe
that in Mr, Purves’ case, the trouble was due to a mere
oversight.
It is reported that a lawyer is likely to succeed
Mr. Hoskins, the ex-Mmistt-r for Lands, who has a - ,
last resigned his s-rab for Tumut. There are nearly
thirty members of the profession m the Hons* at pre-
sent, and the opinion of people who have bad oppor-
tunities to waten their condu it is that any accession to
their strength will be a national calamity. Lawyers
are supposed to be nun of sense; if they are, the wrong
sort must have got inte Parliament. Take figott,
Triokett, and M’Laughlin, for example who are
all good fthows-outside Parliament. They are
mem hers of tne Opposition, but in everything that they
do they play into the 1-auos ef the Government. The
leader of the Opposition sees, and so would any man
but a dull-vi»ioned lawyer, that the only way to
“ corner” the Government is to foron them to introduce
the Land Bill and the Local Government Bill by allow-
ing other measures to pass as quickly as possible. But
Pigott, Triokett, and M’Laughiin—the former and the
latter especially—ate incessantly talking; and
considering that it takes (he Canterbury ite an
hour to convey what an ordinary man could
nut emphatically in ten words, the Govern-
ment gain the advantage. It is not neoes-
sary that a man should be an old politician to
understand the interjections which the Attorney-
General makes when the man of spectacles and conceit
is on his legs. Mr. Pigott is like thoflverare slanderer of
vocal music—he is an inordinate admirer of his own
voice, which has a sound something between the marrow
freezing whiz of a circular saw when cutting through
the middle of a red-gum log, and the flate-hke tremolo
of a stone crusher. The sensation experienced by the
men who have to work In front of sawing machines
must be pleasant compared with that of officers of the
House who 1 ave to listen to this legal luminary for
more than five minutes.
We do not know whether sulphur is used for dis-
infecting the Colonial Secretary’s office, but we know
that Sir Henry’s Pirkes’s recent actions indicate that
he must have had a sniff of brimstone, and that he did
not appreciate it-or, rather, that he did not appreciate
the idea of b-iag treated to it perpetually. He is
evidently determined to book himself for Heaven hrst-
class, though we have no grounds for believing that t hoee
who represent themselves in Sydney aatiokot-agentsfor
Paradise are at all known there. In no other wav can
we account for Sit Henry’s extraordinary speeches on
the Art Gallery question and the Oaths Bla. Such out-
ragoously sanctimonious yowling# were never uttered
by the most shallow-minded Methodist revivalist or
Domain open-air ecclesiastic* Sir Hearj ought to read
Dante’s “ Inferno,” and make himself acquainted with
the prospective fate of the sterling snsffler. Yet, there
was a time, when the man who is now Premier posed as
a Freethinker. After all, what the average mortal
believes regarding a future state depends, firstly, on
what he was taught when he was young, and, secondly,
on the present state of bis fiver. " The bogey man is
invoked by the nurse to still the puling infants cries;
and, when the infant becomes too knowing for the
nurse, it is banded over to the priests and parsons, who
trot out the devil in place of the “ bogey man.” Then,
in course of time, the idea of a devil becomes exploded.
For many years, Sir Henry Parkes, judged by his
private actions, has been travelling rouad unhampered
by bogey or devil. His second childhood now looms
ahead, and he has again placed himself under the
control ot the Old Gentleman of his earlv years. The
people of the coleny are therefore, until it snail please
Parliament or the Almighty te remove the holy one
from the Treasury benchrs, governed by the Fear of
Hell.

down for charitable treatment. The Queensland
Government, however, soon bucked at a trifling
expenditure, and, upon the first opportunity, the
blacks raised their camp, and started back for Messrs.
Byrnes Br «*. station, whtre they knew they would get
“budgery” treatment. These gentlemen collected a

to that officer it inu«t he remarked ths.t they are of a
somewhat shadowy character. One of Mr. Winch’s

Graces. We have acquired, somehow, a comfortable
way of mooning about in a flannel jacket, sarpet
thirty-sixes," with one waiscoat pocket full of cough
lozenges and the other full of snuff. This costume,
however, instinct told us, would hardlr be a fitting
style of attire for the Congregational Church on a gala
night; so having taken counsel with the neighbours,
we finished by inducting ourselves into the gorgeoas
attire hiated at. Using popular—we trust deservedly
so-where we reside, no inconsiderable amount of in-
terest was taken in the figure we should out in setting
out oa our religious pilgrimage. It was generally felt
that the reputation of the voisindge was at stake, and,
therefore, tong before It was time to bedeck ns for the
fray, many were the offers from all sides of miscella-
neous articles of apparel. One lady, indeed, allowed
her friendship to carry her to aa extreme lengtn.
Standing in the middle of the road with a villainous
pair of flve-and-sixpenny everlasting wear," she cried,
“Hi! 1 pulled Charley’s boots off while he was aeleep.
Hero ye are. W hen you com# home put 'em in throagh
our parlour winder.'*. Then, with au anti-Sabbatarian
44 whoop," she tripped into her own residence, hila-
riously shutting the door after her with a bang that
made every “ ohiney ornament" dance in the row.

Of Sunday, in Sydney, we have seen very many
phases. We have done the Corso at Manly—gay dogs
that we are—and, seated by her, in full view of the roll-
ing billowe of the mighty Pacific, we have told the tale
of our passiom in several chapters. Manly possesses a
fascination of its own. Under the Influence of the
invigorating ozone, there (and for the benefit of the
Department ef Education one would mildly hint that
ozone does not mean beer), even timid men muster up
courage to do a “ maeh " on the pier; while those who
in *y dney have but gasped and palpitated at her side,
plunk up spirit, ia the crisp freshness of that delightful
marine -üburo, to squeeze the hand that holds the
Saraso), and softly pat the cheek with the laughing
imple. For ns, however, Manly is just a trifle too
asathetio. Sandriaghaa is plcturefque, but it is too
far. And besides It hae other disabilities. We hired a
buggy and drove down there one Sunday. It was a very
nice vehicle, indeed, but ths horse was too Inquisitive.
Several time*, just as we were about te commence by
softly asking •• what fairer occasion could there be,
when the sun was softly glowing on the universe, when
the rhythmic murmur of the boundless ocean was but
an echo of out fluttering heart—" that horse would stop
short, turn shaiply round, and stare ns ent of counte-
nance. Then at Sandringham itself I There was a cruel
jar there. She’d looked lovely during the drive down.
Slue muslin dress with pink bows, straw hat trimmed
with a black baud and a tin arrow, bronze ehoee, and a
red shawl ever her left arm. Quite the lady, in fact.
But In those ground* to see etar actresses In bewilder-
ing morning eoetumas paddling about in the water was
a cruel crusher. They bad diamonds that sparkled and
daneed in the sunlight, they had laughing eyes and
mua.oal voices—and they had no red shawl.
» « •
Now, what wo dearly cherish is a trip on Sun-
day to 44 Watson’s." We like to go wheezing down the
harbour in an asthmatic steamer with 'Array before ns,
and 'Array behind us " blowing his ’baeca.” And then,
when you arrive there (in the words of many of the
lady.excursionists), "ain't it loverly 1" On the pier there
are all the giddy tars wh# have put om their cricketing
pints and their football jerseys and come wobbling
down in a eeven-and-aixpenny centre-board. And the
hotel 1 " Ain’t that grand, too, just." How the bar is
rushed on the arrival of the steamers by the thirsty
people of the metropolis. “ Hi 1 beer, ’ere, mist er."
•‘hum and pepperment for the lady, please, young
’oomau.” 41 A threepenny purge, old 'un.” These are
the fairy voices you hear in the first rush. And the
Gap I 44 Ain't that grand 1” Many’s the time on a Sun-
day afternoon we nave reclined on that breezy hill and
revelled In the conversations that have been going on
around ua—to say nothing of the spectacle. Heavy-
headed children would stray away from their parents,
when suddenly a female voice in anguish would cry:
44 Oh, Bob, kitoh up little 'finery, he's close to the
hefige, and in another minnit will be rolling down the
ohazzam.” And the yoang men in their best are a
weird and wondrous sight. Such inquisitorial collars,
such resplendent ties, and such bell-bottomed inex-
pressibles 1 And such pale and pimply faces, too, set off
ny Ned Kelly oadies i And tne ladies 1 Sweet crea-
tures I Gambolling guilelessly over the verdant sward,
and flipping each ocher now and auon in the breeze
with tent-fly mouchoire, redolent with “scent" of Mon-
golian antecedents. Happy sylphs 1 41 Hemily " was
in it then, and “’Melia" the heroine of the hour. A
blissful time, truly 1 Nothing wis wanting to make the
trip “'eavenly." They had lollies and oranges, and
bananas and beer. And there was Jack a playin' of his
concertina on the rocks, and father and mother a takin’
of their drop along of Uncle George in the public-house
parlour. On, yes, Watson’s Bay is the place for a Sun-
day's outing—that is, if you are like us—untrammeled
by patrician notions, and the true and honest friend of
the worrnkiu man. But, to return to our muttons.
• • *
The announcement, however, that the Eev.
Joseph Cook was to make his final appearance prior to
leaving the colony at the Congregational Church put to
flight all thoughts, last Sunday, of other recreation.
We resolved at the first glance at the 44 ad." to be
present. Joseph had announced to held forth on the
• 4 Religious Future of Australasia,” and we were espe-
cially anxious to tap the prophetic soul of this dis-
interested vessel on such a momentous subject. It was
a nice calm evening, with a twinkling canopy above and
fugitive scraps of breezes that went lapping throagh the
streets below. As we strolled down Pltt-street, one of
a stream of smug black.ooated gentlemen, and garishly
attired ladies, we felt convinced that Joseph’s farewell
benefit would be well attended. Outside the church
were a large namber of olean-looking young men, who
regarded the building with a proprietorial air, and who
contemplated the inoomiag stream with supercilious
glances. We recognised those young men at once.
They formed tte Hbrald staff. Strolling up to one
cdterie, we said 44 Are all the seats in the parquette
reserved f" This eliciting no reply, we said, faintly,
“Please tell ua where’s the pay-hole." But they went
on talking about the history «f Joseph and his brethren
—so mounting the steps in desperation, we passed into
the building.
• • •
There was a little mob waiting at the end of the
passage, but before we had completely threaded it they
had filtered in, and behold we were confronted by a
stout old lady with a Puritanical bonnet and a severe
expression. This was the female Deacon. She wasn’t
labelled thet, and we had never been told about her;
but we read the intelligence in her calculating eye.
41 Can you squeeze in a little one, ma’am P" wo said,
trying to oouueal the nnsaamtss we felt under a ghastly
semblance of jocularity. She nude no reply, bat dart-
ing at us a glance of intense dislike, the beckoned iu a
spectral manner, anl without a word led the way to a
pew near the pulpit. Once there, we smalt our hat for
vhe orthodox minute and a-half, and then rising to the
service, proceeded to loot about us. The place was
crowded with a congregation, which, though eminently
respectable, lacked that chio element, which since the
return of Chris, from tue Gontinong, has been the
ruling characteristic of St. Mark’s. Trade—the retail
trade—was strongly represented, and we wore made
uncomfortable from the jump by the close proximity of
a storekeeper to whom some little while since we had
addisteed a farewell letter dated front the Austral
“ within an hoar of sailing." There were five in our
yew—three naan in gorgeous array, and next to ue a
J'ooag lady In grey alpaca and silver jewellery, the
ooket of which, whenever she moved, clanked np
against the bone-buttons of her costume with a sound
which had the effect of at once recalling our thoughts
to earthly matters. This young person we knew would
cause us some discomfiture. She bad come armed with
a volume of lyrics marked (with a pleasant journalistic
flavour/ 44 Congregational Hymn 800k —with Supple-
ment," and alio an appalling tome containing the tunes
pertaining to the same. She was a devent little lady
and prayed exceedingly; and on catching sight of our
note-book, very properly looked horrified in the ex-
treme. We watched her as she fixed her sin-attacking
battery, and we shuddered. Instinct told us that we
should be asked to hold a corner of one of those holy
works, and knowing our nnworthiness, we trembled.
• • *
The Congregational Church is an edifice built very
much on the model of the modem Music Hall, and
decorated in precisely the same manner as are dozens
of the haunts of the 44 lion-comiques." '1 he colours
employed are green, gold, and buff, and the ceiling,
which is dene in green squares, with a star in the
middle, exhibits some very pretty stencilling. At
the east end is the orgin, which is in an em-
brasure, the roof of which ia painted to resemble
a starry canopy, the blue being sadly out of
harmony with the gaudily-painted ornamental pipes
of the organ. The choir was rather numerous.
It consisted of ten thin little girls in the front row,
and a corresponding number of 44 gents” behind;
these being led by an ancient party with a grey
moustache, who opened his mouth so wide that it
seemed a miracle every time he went for a high note
the lady vocalist in front was not sucked down like an
oyster. There was a little girl in black with a
44 Patience" hat on, one in gre-y with ted jockey
sleeves: a stout youfig person in white, who, when
she smiled, looked like the Countess’s confidante in a
lever dt rideau ; and one in a dark stuff dress, with an
elegant display of ruffling. The midd o lady, who
44 had a voice," was in striped mohair, and an elderly
lady In black, a demure party in green, and one or two
shadowy yonng ladies iu gowns Of neutral tints, made
up the complement. The pulpit is very roomy—it is a
triple pulpit in fact, and below is a large space with a
table, in which the deacons give out when there is
going to be a collection. A proper precaution, however,
has been taken by the Church authorit es to have this
part securely railed in. The deacons’ nreeeut risk
may, therefore, be said to be reduced to a minimum.
• • •
The service opened with an extempore prayer,
delivered by Mr. Cook, whose appearance—this is
a positive fact—was the signal for suppressed applause.
Mr. Cook’s prayer was eminently practical. Ha
prayed for onr hearts, our families our business, and
our Government, in precisely the order in which we
give them. We had a good look at Mr. C. while he was
thus employed, and the conclusion we came to was that
though we are very gool and religions and all that, we
don't somehow feel impressed by the prayers of a
fellow who seems so full of beef. Mr. Cook is a
stent gentleman who appears to feel the heat a good
deal—the more so, perhaps just after a tea. the in-
gredients of which were most likely the test of the cold
veal and a stack of generously-bntteied muffins. He
has a high forehead, a long grey goatee, and a face, tha
general expression of which is more hard than holy. But
then Mr. Cook has expressly given out that he is not a
clergyman—and yon can’t reasonably expect a man to
come all the way from 44 God A’mighty’s Great U-nited
States "—we are quoting Martin Chuzzlewit —and look
holy, without he is paid for it. After the prayer came
a hymm—and then we were in for it. The young lady
next to us found the places in her books, and on the
organ striking up, offered ns a corner. We took a
corner of tbe email one, instead of supporting the two,
and down wont the mueio score with a crash. Then
both stooping at once we knocked onr heads together.
44 A thousand pardons I" 44 Oh. not at all " 44 Could we
trouble you for a moment f" 44 Sir 111" 44 Of no conse-
quence, madam, but you've got your foot on our hat."
• * *
There was a “ chapter ” after this, or rather
what, perhaps, we might term, without irreverence, a
Scriptural olio. This was succeeded by a very loud
'• chant," in which we detected ourselves feebly chirrup-
ing out something about trumps and halos, emulated
thereto by the proprietress of the library, who frown-
ingly abjured as to 44 join In the heavenly praise, 4 ’ and
smiled on ns when we did so. Wa have many accom-
plishments—a great many—but singing is hardly one of
them. At writing a tract, or the prospectus of a cop-
per-mine we are all there, but onr vocalisation is by no
means gorgeous. There was a devout young lady in
black in the pew immediately behind us. Her face bad
been calm and statuesque, and her eyes filled with
admiration of the preacher. Directly we began to sing,
however, she looked with amazement up to the
reof, down to the floor, to the right and to the left. We
watched her (still singing) and then shrunk within
ourselves. We knew that she was wishing that carpen-
ter wsuld leave off sawlug his planks during church
time.
» « ft
A tremendous long prayer, a hymn sandwich,
and then the sermon. During the prayer, a special
appeal was made for the little children—probably
Grlbble’s (we mean, ef course, those under Oribble’s
owe) —who 4 ate far Irom any chance of culture," and it
concluded by a peroration which, being of the 44 com-
foitably religions” order, ptoved eminently effective
with the congregation. Tbe texc of the sermon was
taken from the 1 Lth and 12th verses of tha 21st chapter
of Isaiah, a portion of the scriptures to be found—when
tbe Bible is non-mutilated- m the Old Testament.
Here they are
44 11, The burden of Dumah. He calleth to
me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night ?
Watchman, what of the night?
12 The watchman said. The morning cometh,
and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire
ye; return, come."
This text clutched by Mr. Cooke was remarkable for
the simple reaeou that he did not include the next verse
in his selection, which, his being almost an entirely
secular discouise would have given him—having tbe
reputation of being a shrewd observer of men and
things—a grea- deal more scope tban tbe two veisea
which preceded it. Jugezen .-
■ 4 The burden upon Arabia. Ia the forest in
Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies
of Dedanim."
• • •
Mr. Cook preached from notes, and before he
had ejaculated half-a-dozen sentences we perceived
that he was dishing up a discourse from the material
he had jotted down for his American 44 work" on
Australia. He told us that he had been to 44 thirteen
of out cities ” during a period of three months, a p’eoe
of intelligence which doubtless caused astonishment
in mind* of his audience that he had uot learntd in
that time to pronounce the names of them correctly.
He had gathered in Brif bane that 4 ‘servile labour
would never be tolerated in Queensland because we
were colonised here ” by the English, Scotch, and
ha.hum, a fair sprinkling of Germans Me ignored tho
Irish, and jet there was a member of the ferce out-
side wko had a Ballinasloe smile, and a Mulligan
Guards attitude. He then 44 t»ld us the trooth about
our institootions." which, in the opinion of the gifted
lecturer, were susceptible of muck improvement.
“ You," he said, 44 are but an offshoot of England. 44
Well, England wants improving, Yet yen can’t tell
England she requires to be Americanized. She
would be offended; but yon Pan tell her without
offence perhaps that she would be the better
for being Anstralianised." Tae 44 Confederation of
the colonies ” he trusted to see, ai d con.
sidered that it would be speedily brought
about if 44 a couple ef Russian privateers” attacked one
of our coast cities. A mutual copyright law (ths ely
dog 1) between England and America was his dearest
dream; and he considered that, ere long, the British
empire would become like America—a gi eit Republic.
He believed in prayers for rain, and also "players for
the building of reeervoiro" —no 4 * dams," thank you landI —
and txpressed a decided opinion that in all cases the
churches should be the ruling power in polities—a sen-
tire ent which leadens to the conclusion that the rev.
gentlemau hae bten taking considerably more of the
Protestant Standard than is good for him. Mr. Cook
was very hot all through tho service, both bodily and
oratorioally—the former more especially. Indeed, at
one point, when the deacon came under the pulpit to
dispel the pleasant allusion that it was a free 44 pitch 44
by telling us to get our shillings ready for th# plates,
Mr. C. happened to look dowu on him approvingly,
when the worthy subordinate gaye a start, and looked
wildly about for his umbrella.
• • •
It was a quarter-past nine aa we all filed out of
the doors, every one of which was jealously guarded by
a deaooa, who significantly rattled silver coin ia a soup-
plate. We put a shilling la, and then, asking the
d*acon 4 s blessing, went home to pray for ourselves.
We may remark that during the evening a very long
prayer was offered up for MJefferis; aud as we were
jogging homo throagh the starlit streets, we could
hardly refrain from tha temptation of turning back,
knocking at the Rev. James’s door, and asking him,
in the words of Mr. Weller, senior, 44 how he felt
I arterit.”

It was a judge ; it also was a black gin tried for
Stealing a watch ; and it dually is an Irish shepherd,

without auy more stains on her character, the judge

The Evening News has been shown a snake
with sprouting toes and nails, which was allied recently
at Kushoutt«r’(i Bay, and Alfred, in his usual happy

he was letting the reptile out as a oaryst-beater. We

No, you don’t, Wear boy. “ Decay” la a geod mu«, for

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
The Rockhampton J.C. have decided to have a
Midsummer meeting on Boxing Day.
The West Australian Athletic Club held their
rst meeting at Perth on Tuesday.
The stewards of the Melbourne Hunt Club
have disqualified P. Leng for six monthe for mis-
conduct.
Cunnamulla was not seriously injured after all.
He has regained his position amongst the favourites
for the Melbourne Cup.
The Australian Eleven left Liverpool on 30th
September for New York on board the Guion Com-
pany’s steamer Alaska.
The foot-race on Saturday at Wallsond for
£25 aside, between Toull and Taylor, resulted in an easy
win for Youll.
The* Australian Eleven were escorted to the
Alaska by a band, and wero heartily cheered as the ship
left. Midwinter accompanies the team to Australia.
The Wagga Wagga Bicycle Club have adopted
the Sydney Suburban Bicycle Club rules with slight
Iterations. Twenty-one members have been enrolled.
The final match for the N.S.W. Bowling Asso-
ciation champion modal came off on the King's School
ground on Friday last, between Mr. John Forsyth and
Mr. John Toohey. The former made 31 points against
his opponent’s 12.
There is to be a Press match at the New South
Wales Rlfls Association meeting. The conditions are
seven shots at 400 yards, and it is to come off ox the
14 th October. Anybody who has an old gun to lend
will kindly call at the Rum office.
A three-mile trotting match for J!100 took place
at Randwiok racecourse on Saturday, between S. Ross’
Grey Paddy and W. Gates’s Sir William. The latter won
easily in 10 minutes 15 secs. Grey Paddy was ridden,
while “B lotty " drove Sir William.
The Prince Alfred Yacht Club were the guests
of the vice-commodore, Dr. Milford, on Saturday, at
Manly, in order to wish bon voyage to Mr. J. H. Want,
who is about to do the ** oontlnong ” and other plaoes.
Fizz, farewell, and felicitations.
Mr. De Mestra lost a valuable horse by Trump
Card, at the I.S.N. Co.’s wharf, on the 29bh September,
The staging from the steamer to the wharf was devoid
‘of sides, and the horse, whilst being led across it,
began .to plunge. He fell into the water, and was
drowned.
Several improvements have lately been effected
in the Caulfield Racecourse. Amongst other altera-
tions a large ring, 40 yards in diameter, is being en-
closed, outside which no bookmaker will be allowed to-
ply his vocation, and a charge will be made for admis-
sion to this ring.
The Bill for the Suppression of Sweeps has been
read a second time in the Victorian Assembly. The
Bill is to come into operation on Ist February, 1883,
so that existing events may not be interfered with. The
measure will not touch sweeps got up privately at
aoing and other sports meetings.
Fryingpan, Guesswork, and Transferred are
well supported for the Caulfield Guineas, but the tip of
the talent ia Hecla. Navigator is favourite for the
V.R.C. Derby, but there are still many nibblers at
Segenhoe. Sweet William is still the nominal first
favourite for the Melbourne Cup.
At a race-meeting up at—well, Timbuotoo —
there were sixteen gambling tables at work, and the
local police were the best customers. When they
were athirst, they drank at the neighbouring booth at
the expense of the landlord, who dared not grumble for
fear of a future conviction under the Licensing Act.
The local *• beak " is a Spaniard, and is in business in
the town ; consequently the law is blind to the delin-
quencies of his customers.
The Daily News, in an article analysing the
result of the Australian cricketers’ tour in England,
expresses an opinion that they have taught the home
cricketers to be more humble and less self-oonfldent of
their prowess in the field and at the wicket. The
Daily News, evidently, thinks that the English
cricketers want a lesson in One thing or the other —
perhaps it lain cricket.
The opening match for the Printers* Challenge
Cup was commenced on Saturday, the Herald and
Caxton Clubs being the contestants. The Herald took
the wickets, and were disposed of for 65 runs—
M'Qoveney 16, and King 16, being the highest scorers.
The Caxtons were disposed of for 25 runs, principally
through F. M'Qoveney’s elf active bowling. The match
looks like a win for the Herald.
United C.C. v. Osborne C.C. Surry
United, 76j Osborne, 33. O. Ogiivy bowled seven
wickets for 18 runs. Croker (not out) 22, Arkinstall 21,
Thomson, 14, were tha highest scorers. The Surry
United have commenced this season auspiciously, three
strong clnbg—Balmain Surry, Osborne, and Oriental —
having had to lower their colours before them.
The aporta at the Eight-hour picnic were exceed-
ingly well contested, J. Sara, with i 2 yards, won the
yards handicap. The Society Men’s Race, 45 years
and over, 150 yards, handicap, was won by 0. Arnold, 4
Tne Two Miles Walking Handicap was won by
;? Lindsay, 5 yards. P. Richards won the one hour
ilo-as-you-please. The Veterans’ One Mile Walk, 55
eira and over, was won by W. Bishop. P. P. Cai-
han, with 18 yards start, won the 400 Yards Handi-
cap Hurdle Race. The great event was the All Comers
v-nampmn Handicap, 220, 440, and 880 yards, which was
won by T. Collins, who was second in the 220 and first
in tho 440 and 880.
The farewell banquet to the Australian cricket-
ers by the colonists resident in Louden, was given on
28th September, with great icldt, at the Criterion Hotel.
Nearly 300 persons were present. Sir Henry Barkly
proposed ** Our Guests." Murdoch, who was greeted
with enthusiasm, responded, and in concluding pro-
posed "The Cricketers of England," coupled with the
names of Hornby and Thornton. Hornby responded.
Apologies were read from Lord Harris and the Earl ot
Beesborough. Amongst those present were Sir Charles
Du Cane, Sir Saul Samuel, Messrs. W, Westgarth,
E. C. Want, F. H. Danger, and W. Q. Grace,
At the Maryborough (Vic.) races Cracksman won
the Selling Hurdle iuoe, Berlin was second. Two
other horses started, but did not go the distance, rive
started for the Maryborough and Carisbrook Handi-
cap, which was won by Plying Jib. Only two started
for the Novel Selling Race, which was won by Want-
age. Squireen won the Half-mile Flatter by five
lengths. Beadsman won the Tullaroop Handicap,
Plying Jib being second. Cracksman was again the
winner of the Hurdle Rice. Incognito won the
Stewards’ Handicap, and Plying Jib scored another
win in the Town Plate.
The football match between N.S.W. and
Wellington (N.Z.), resulted in rather an easy victory
for the former by two goals and two tries to Welling-
ton’s one try. The attendance was esti mated at 5000.
The Acting-Governor, Sir James Prendergast, was
present. The play of the N.S.W. men was much
admired, especially their passing. The Wellingtons
had the best of the scrimmages, but their backs were
deficient. Both teams dined together in the evening.
The return match came etf on 20th September, The
weather was unfavourable. Sydney won by a goal and
two tries to Wellington nil.
O’Connor and Burk ran a return mile at Dunedin
for the championship of New Zealand. Pour thousand
people were present. Burk led by five yards in the first
lap, then O’Connor eame up and passed him, and took a
strong lead, eventually winning by forty yards in 4 min.
29$ see. The first half mile was done in 2 min. 13 seo.
There are some ugly rumours afloat with reference to
this match. It is alleged that O’Connor was squared
by the Burk party, and that he afterwards made up his
mind to run straight. However, he did not let them
know of bis changed mind, and they laid many sixes to
tonra on Burk. Among those in the “know" were,
it is said, a well-known N.Z. “ book ” and an ex-luminary
of the P.E., who must have netted a few hundreds.
The second contest for the Furness Junior Cup
was commenced at Moore Park on Saturday, between
the Oriental and Clio Clubs. The latter went first to
the wickets, and scored 65, Abel 18, and Sweetman 16,
being the highest scorers. The Oriental batsmen were
dismissed for the small seore of 26, not one obtaining
double figures. The Olios were less fortunate in their
second innings, eight of their wickets having fallen for
28 runs when time was called. The match is still very
open, and the Orientals will not probaoly have more
than 60 runs to go against. There were some com-
plaints about the matting interfering with the batsmen
through being badly laid down. This will be a matter
for the O.C C. secretary to look after next Saturday,
seeing that his club have to make the rnns.
The New South Wales team were favourites at
2 to 1 for the football match against Wanganui (N Z )
Richmond played in the place of Jennings, and the game
consisted of two spells of 40 minutes each. In the first
Wanganui had the best of it, Sydney touching down no
less than fonr times in self-defence. The second spell
was marked by the united play of the Sydney men, and
especially that of Baj iss, who on two ur three occasions
successfully dodged the whole of the Wanganui men,
only being caught when near his opponents’ goal. T’le
play on both sides, throughout the game, was good.
The Sydney men won by a goal and two tries (9 points)
to Wanganui’s one try (2 points). Bayley, one of the
Wanganui half-backs, received a nasty blow on the fore-
head through colliding with one of the Sydney men, and
had to retire.
Another All-England Eleven had the temerity to
tackle the Australian Eleven at Harrowgate, and (of
course) the Australians won by four wickets. The Eng.
lish team scored 72 in their first innings, and the Aus-
tralians 134. The English Eleven made a better stand
in the second innings, which closed for 165, leaving the
Australians 104 to get to win, which they did with the
loss of six wlokets. It was evidently the intention of
the English team to wipe ont their defeat on the Uval,
bat the result of this match will now tend to confirm
many in their convictions that the best snex won on
both occasions. We are magnanimous, and respect the
feelings of our fallen foes by not expressing our firm
opinion on the subjeot.
The American knook-me-down Johnny Sullivan
has had his lustre tarnished since Wilson stood up
before him and was not knocked out ia four rounds.
Now Wilson is inundated with offers of matches, and
those who were frightened of Sullivan before are coming
forward to take up his challenge as Wilson did.
Richard K. Pox, the proprietor of the N.T. Police
Gazette, who backed Ryan in the great Eyan-Sullivan
fight, is the man who brought Wilson over from Eng.
land to take up Sullivan's challenge. Now he offers to
back Wilson to fight Sullivan for the championship of
the world and 5000 dollars aside. This match is likely
to come to a head, and Wilson will either win or get
his head broken in the first or second round. Paddy
Byan intends to tackle Sullivan again, and Elliott, whom
Sullivan knocked out, wants to light Wilson. The noble
art is looking up in America.
The attendance was not large at the Melbourne
Hunt Clnb’s races at Plemington on Saturday, but the
racing was very interesting. The Governor and suite
were present. Six started for the Handicap Hurdle
Race. A splendid race took place between Qimbler
and Red Rover, the former winning by a short head,
Dundreary being a bad third. Pour started for the
Amateur Hurdle Race. Elector, the favourite, ran off
the course. Blue Peter won easily. Van Tromp, who
was third, fell. In the Selling Rice, Kanaka got the
lead and held it to the finish, winning easily by six
lengths. Eleven started for the Hunt Club Steeple,
chase. Alhambra ran an excellent race, and won easily
by five lengths. Delusion won the Plying Stakes,
beating the favourite (Breeze) by a length. Abdallah
won, easily, the Open Steepleohaee. Brim, the favour-
ite, fell at the first fence. A good race took place for
the Handicap Plat Rice; won by half a length by

Perhaps the most successful and improving of
onr amateur pedestrians is the sprint runner, Mr. F.
Russell. At the 8. A. A.O. sports ha succeeded 1h show-
lug Rush the “full front of his back" on two occasions,
and on Saturday, at the H.H.A.C. sports, he won the
100 yards and the Forced Handicap of 15) from scratch,
besides getting places in other events. We are glad to
offer a word of encouragement to one who has the real
grit in him and who undergoes the necessary prepara-
tion for a public race. As a matter of fact, very few of
our amateurs come fit to the post, notably in the long
distances. In nearly every race from a quarter-mile
upwards, the winner or placed men have to be led or
carried from the field. The champion amateur pedes-
triau of N.B. Wales is not to be found amongst this lot.
We want to sea a man trot in yards ahead of every hing
else in good time, and then run to his quarters with-
out assistance. Over-taxing the untrained physical
powers will never produce a champion, and will do more
barm than good to the ambitious pot-hunter.
The Eyde Races were well patronised by Sydney
visitors. The racing was not very excellent, though
the arrangements were most complete. A number of
roughs gate Mr. Empson some trouble by setting fire
to his booth, and carrying off his oash-box containing
about £6O. These gentry seem to be emboldened in
their malpractices by a recent magisterial decision. It
must certainly be said that at the last Rand wick meet-
ing there was an unusual number of the lowest class of
thieves and swindlers, and Ryde must have been
favoured with a visit from some of them The race
officials intend to recoup Mr. Empson out ot the profits
of the meeting. The Hurdle Race was won by two
lengths by Clemsntina, Darby the Blast being second.
Eva and Chance ran a good race for the Eyde Handicap,
tha former winning. Tinoy w->n the Selling Rase, and
was bought'by Mr* E. Bedford for £29 Three shorted
for the Steeplechase. .Merton ran round the first fence,
but the others oould not be got over the water-) amp,
which allowed him to come up He refused the first
time, but went over at the second attempt, and led for
the rest of the way. Lady Power got over the first
water-jump, but stopped at the second. Merton came
down at the last water-jump, but his rider re-moun' -d
him and rode him home an easy winner. The District
Handicap was the beat race of the day. Chance and
Maid of Australia running a dead head. In the run-ott.
Chance won easily.
The athletic season closed on Saturday on the
Association Ground with the Hunter's Hill Amateur
Athletic Club's sports, which were very interesting, but
the attendance was not large. The Club may be con-
gratulated upon the completeness of its arrangements.
The 150 yards’ handicap for boys under 16, residents of
the district, was won by E. Fitzgerald, scratch, in
19 210 sec.—E. Pearson, scratch, being second. The
handicap 120 yards hurdles fell to H. Phillips, from
scratch, in 19 sec. The handicap mile walk was won by
P. W. Maddocks, with 15 sec. start, in 8 min. 12 8-10 sec.
A. James, scratch, was second. The 100 yards’ race
went to F. Russell by half a yard, in 116 10 sec. The
schools' 220 yards’ champion race was won by J. Parker,
Sydney Grammar School, in 254 »eo. The half-mile race
for the President's Challenge Cup, for residents of the
district, was won by P. E. Pedler. This being his second
win, he becomes permanent holder of the trophy. The
3-miles bicycle race was won by R. Shute, 50 yards, in
11 min 25 sec. The 150 yards’ handicap was won by
P. C. Pairland, 3 yards, by a yard, in 15 810. sec. F, L.

cap, in 4 min. 47 se®. ; D D. Middleton, 25 yards, being

being turned towards the bowler. Mr. O’Neill was the
b&tsman, and Mr. Headrick was the bowler. The
bowler was to bowl the batsman in six balls. O’Neill
batted splendidly until the sixth ball, which Headrick
let fiy with Spofforth-like pace and Evans-like precision,

with the Boston wine-clerks in a game with the Pro-
videnoe wine-clerks, played July 27 in Providence, R.I.
The Providence team won after a close contest by a

other side If it could knock him out in the first four
innings “Stonewall” Barlow, in a recent game
between Lancashire and Nottingham, in England,
carried his bat right throngh the second innings of his
county, being in two hours and a half for five runs.
Remarkably slow scoring this, and it completely
eclipses all previous performances in that particular.
It may be considered the best of orieket, bat some
persons will, perhaps, think it a trifle tedious

mile single scull working-bout contest in 22min. 22ne0.,
three lengths ahead of his brother Richard The New
York Spirit of the Times says the follows who style
themselves the Amateur Rowing Association, and
assume to control British aquatic sport, seem to be an
exceedingly disreputable but noisy minority of Eng-
laud’s amateur oarsmen. English conservatism and slow-
ness have thus far endured their arrogant impudence,
but disaster and disgrace threaten them in the future...

besio, near Manchester, N.H., July 22, between Fred.

bary, one of the Atalanta crew who visited England in
1872, sent £25 to the Hillsdale fund, with this com-
ment : " I hope they may be enabled to remain in Eng.
land long enough to determine whether it was ignorance
or fear which controlled the action of the clubs refusing
to compete with them.” However, the Hillsdales have
been beaten The Thames Club crew accepted the
challenge of the Hillsdale crew against the will of the
English Amateur Rowing Association. The latter
body afterwards made inquiries and satisfied them-
selves that the Hillsdale crew were “ gentlemen."
The American Press discovered that one of the
most prominent members of the Association was a
"peddler of bottled beer,” and they rang the changes...
Revue dbs Spoets, writing on the amateur question in
connection with the late Henley Regatta, suggests the
following rule for adoption by the Henley stewards
“ No foreign rowing man shall be considered as an
amateur by the Henley committee should they entertain
any scruple as to his being able to defeat an English-
man." With his innings of 30 against Yorkshire at
Dewsbury, Murdoch completed 1000 runs In England.
He had then taken part in 17 matches, scoring 1013 runs,
at an average of 42 per Innings. Five days later, C. T.
Studd. with 39 not out for Middlesex, raised his record
to 1037 runs, also obtained in 17 matches, giving him an
average of 39. These two batsmen stand at the head of
cricketers in England this year; and their enormous
totals had been reached, be it remembered, while) the
season had still some two months to run.

THE BALLAD OF THE COMET.
Belinda was a nice young girl
(For short, they called her Biddy),
And most demure, the neighbours said,
** Oh, not the least bit giddy I "
All day Belinda was on view.
Her work she never shirked it 5
She toiled at a machine-shop, just
To show folks how they worked it.
And howling swells would come in cabs,
And silver lockets bring her;
They’d chat a hit, and then they’d buy
A Wilson or a Singer.
So time went on; at length there came
A smart man from Amurker,
Who haunted all day long the shop
And mashed the lovely worker.
Her pa (who kept a boarding-house)
Knew naught about this masher;
His surname we have quite forgot.
His Christian name was Slasher.
One mern he thought he hoard a noise
As he awoke, and, yawning;
Ho listened and he saw the day
Was only after dawning.
Ho heard a voice si:y " Lovely Bid!
Dress quickly, dear; so rum it
Looks just now at this early hour
That gorgeous, flashing comet.”
** Hush, hush,’’ she cried; " Oh, Pitzjamea, don’t
Thus be, my duck, a roarer,
For there’ll be 'ructions if you wake
That hoary-headed snorer.
** Go over there, beneath the tree,
Where it is dark and shady,
Amd I’m there quick."—The father cried 1
** Oh, wo will see, my lady,"
Ho hoard her ” pass " her morning gown
Above there In her attic.
And then he took a stick and watched
For that child so erratic.
** Why don’t yon come f That you're asleep
Again I am a fearer."
And then a low and muffled voice
Said—“ Darling here; come nearer."
** I come, I fly," ho cried as he
Her little head quick spotted.
He came, he flew, and then. Great Scott I
Ton just believe he got it.
She cried at first, she smiled soon, then
She yelled as she regarded
That Mnrkan man with flower-pots
So skilfully bombarded.
When on the ground he heard her laugh j
At this with rage he started,
And with an eyeball in his hand
He limpingly departed.
** How came this thus ? ” the chemist said;
** A hard bout I fear from it ”
I’m subject to these things at times,"
Ho groaned—** It’s—er—the comet.”

CHEAPEST DjRAPEES IN AUSTRALIA,
SOCIAL.
A grand ball was given by Mr. and Mrs. Henry
Mort, of Mount Adelaide, last Tuesday, in the Nitha-
dale rooms, which were lavishly prepared and beautified
for the occasion. Greenery and real flowers, coloured
lights and festoons, draperies and danoefs made ft
brilliant picture. Refreshment tables ware placed in
the cousuvatory, amid the coot, fresh ferns, and the
mellow notes of a beautifully soft orchestra floated
through the rooms. Society belles shone their
brightest in the radiant assemblage, “ middies ” and
maidens mingled ia the throng officers, professional
men, and " eligibles ” paced the floor, and ihe attaches
of vice royalty came one and came all. Though the
dresses were grin , they were not gav, for simplicity
in colour was the dominant feature, and more than half
the oostucres were pure white. Trains there were, of
course, for how cm a lady be en grande tenue without
one F Nearly 300 guests had accepted invitations, and
the fashionable gathering and complete arrangements
stamped it as one of the chief halls of the season. Of
the moderate programme of eighteen danies, nice were
wait zes; not too large a proportion for those enthusiasts
to whom the waltz is all in all, and other dances merely
times to rest. And no wonder, for very ideals of easy
grace were some of those earnest pairs. An early hour
brought the brilliant scene to a close, and fair ones and
fond ones went home through the chilly morn “ to sleep
—perohnnou to dream," to dream of sweet moments
flown, of burning eyes, and of whispers that witoh the
soul.

i The anniversary of the Robert Burns Masonic
Lodge was celebrated on Thursday by a Garden Party
«,t Botany. Most of the party went out early in the
afternoon, others followed later. Cricket, croquet,
garden walks and talks, and refreshers, occupied toose
who didn’t care to dance, while those who did had the
pleasure of skimming over a glassy floor suih as they
can’t find every day, in unison with the well-timed music
of the f oucg Australian Band. This band really gives
excellent ctauce music, and by perseverance its member*
may become celebrated some day: the only danger is,
that, being in such popular request, they may possibly
blow themselves out of this vale ot vain shows before
that day arrives The lich dresses of some of the
croquet parly showed to advantage on the emerald lawn,
and the cricket ball whion the Masonic demon bowlers
sent vigorously in all directions added animation to the
scene. There was ample room for those who ohose to
dance, for whom Mr. Evan Jones acted as M.C.; and
conspicuous among them were a slender blonde in pale
blue, and a short and chic y«ung lady from Paddington
Road, whoso footsteps were as "springy" as her new
season's sateen Best of the dres-es were thosa worn
by two fair sisters from Danington: one was ivory
China bilk and Cardinal satiu, the other a tasteful com-
bination of light figured satin and cream drapings and
lace, wi*h bonnet to match. Leopard stripes rendered
a pair of nwdans very interesting as works ot art; and
a crimson cloth dress, with gimp trimming. *&• ex-
tremely neat on a Woollahra young lady. A few dresses
were very gay : one seemed to be a picture of a flower-
show, another a piece of bedroom wall-paper, and a
fanciful sateen made a lady look like a garden lawn up
above and a gold-mine down below. About 150 sat
down to a excellent banquet at seven o’clock, provided
by Prank Hmith, the pavilion being lighted by the
Needle’* vas chandeliers and the portable Era lamps as
well. When Ihe dinner disappeared, a few toasts were
given, with the usual six bars of music to drown the
gargles. The change from the wonted ball to a garden
party was quite successful; aud whan the midnight
- -urn took them home, all were satisfied with a capital
clay,

Saturday's attendance at the Hunter’s Hill
sp irta was meagre, and the meandering maidens who
trod down the top-dressing on the lawn wete not
remarkable for toilettes. Most eye-oatohing were a few
sateens ; especially so were those of two tall listers,
who wore large-patterned paaiers, very full, with
kilted skirts and p quant hats. Two short sisters
were seen in deep blue sateens, with white flowering in
rows on the skirts, and a row of the same forming a
shoulder-cape tor each ; straw-coloured belts and hats.
A sky-blue silk was as noticeable for the very large
white flowers on it as for the decided "tendency to
roundness ** of the figure that was in it,
unobtrusively dressed, a surveyor’s wife, in dun
cashmere pud striped brown satin trimming, was belle,
by virtue of her classic face. A cambric aud lace, ail
cream, was very dainty.

The third annual ball of the Ivanhoe Assembly
on hriday, in thi lowa Hall, was their most ambitious
effort yet. Thera were over 100 present, nearly all
good dancers. At nine they staitsd, *nd at four
stopped. The style of dre-s was opuonal, but among
the gentlemen, with the exception of a Beadle and a
Mexican, there were no novelties. A Harlequin, a Cap-
tain, and some Sailors were not new. And there was
a gentle youth overcome by a surfeit of—»pongo cake
or something—but that wasn’t novel, by any means.
Among the ladies, some really pretty dre*ses
were dieplsycd. From Oxford-* treat came a cocoa-
brown satin, with scalloped edging of cream lace, that
was handaom*, and well-tilled, and balloon sleeve* of
airiest loco, shewing a plump arm, wire effective. Mm
Cunningham was '‘Night," »o wai someone else.
Miss Campbell, "Queen of Be*d«," and from the
qnautit j ehe carried, ought to bend*ear for
next few jeorp. Miss Webber was a good “Claudine '
and dancer; aud a nsmesake of hers was "Folly," in
bluo and cream fratin. ft would bo hard to namt the
best dancers; but the small* sf- lady, as "Kuih, und
the tfl eat in •’ guarautiue" «atin, pearls and ivy leaves,
could not be excelled. Miss Clark was another
"Ruth," with gold network bodice. Miss Alice Wil-
liams was iu black satin, steel beaded, black laco
sleeves, sash of bluo ratin crewelled, as a Spanish Girl —
pailioularly span-niah round the waist, sJho also had
n naw>o-ake, who made a very pretty Lizzie Stofal.
Miss White was bluo; and M an Brooks blooming, as
"Dolly Vard< n ’’. Misses Bone ami Amy Baldook
were each "Poly." a very pretty dress was of twi
shades of grenat satin, with the amber front cf the
skirt richly gathered and looped with fine pearls,
cream lace collar of heart shape coming on to the
VroHßt Mis* Ryan wore n handsome cardinal satin,
with old gold lace and pearls, and danced eleverly. A
iovclv dr-'*s was of cardinal and pale straw s -tin com-
bined. with alternate rows of gathering and kilting
very flae’y done, and studded with Single pearls. The
w-srer was a tall brunette, Mies BaMock, who divided
with Miss Chate, in umber the honour of bade. Masio
came rom a string band, and Compagnoni catered
satisfactorily iu the " photo, room,"

A complimentary dance was given in the Rand-
wick Town Hall, last Thursday, to Mr. and Mrs.
Femell, by the gentlemen who have practised acrobatic
feats aud genuflexions in their big roorn during the
winter, on rollers The patty was a comfortable one
of abnut 100, and blue aud white were chief colours.
Mrs Pi.mell wore blue silk, flounces t f white lace. A
young lady from Clythn was in cream with blue facings,
one from the Floral House in white and bln*, and
necklet of flowers. Frem Mandeson, Woollabra. cam#
a nioo girl in pink aud roses; from Darlinghurst, a
belle in blu« and white; and, from Llanfojet, ou* lady
in ore in, and one ditto in the epidemic blue and white.
A " weaker vessel" was decked with cream brocbfi, and
she ia to gladden a surveyor’s heart. Compagnoni’s
catering was de luxe; music timely, and, after the
pro ” players bad made tracks for the last tram, fun
was kept agog till after 2 a.m. Mr. H. Stutohbury
was M.C.

At Petersham, the third and last private assem-
bly of th« season took pi oe in the local Town Hall on
the 28IL Sopt. Most of the guests (whosenumbers went
into three fignm some of them very nice figures, too)
came from Petersham and vicinity Eighteen dances
were executed, including eight waltzes. In most oases,
they wore done well; in others, the pe pie who did them
ought to have been executed, too. But we’ll turn on
tb’l ft tie panorama of fair women. Two Burwood sisters
npprfl.r, one in old gold and black, but both worshipped
idolatronsiy; a lady from Forest Lodge in black ; next,
a little lady, with a royal name, from Darlinghurst—
and no hag of a-versions was ever guarded more de-
votedly by a bank official than she in black; thee, in
cream Katin, comas from not far off the fair bode her-
self. a train of admirer? basking in the bbss of her
shade'-, aml two naval offle-rs foremost among her
nttondai.ta; lastly, two daughters of a gallant captain
of Pc t iTf-h-itu, with a foreign name. Others were bright
and shining stars in the constellation of beauty, but we
don’t want to dazzle with too many at once. The
assembly separated soon after midnight.
A pleasant gathering of some of Mdlle. Ghar-
bonuet’s pupils took place a f her ievidence. Orwell

(these two very clo«o, Mies Hill gaining in expression,
while Miss Br>>dziek had the advantage iu correctness

pupils on their excel eme, and added that he hid not
found it easy to "flace" them.

The first Tradesmen s Spring Ball was held at
Braid wood on the 28 h iept., and proved a euc»a«».
Among the elegant dresses was a cream satin with
cardinal trimming, a pale green with black lace, and a
pale pink with black velvet bodr. Belle was a brunett*
in white and cardinal; two sisters in grey, trimmed
with shaded satiu, were attr olive, a* wore also a till
hdy in pink, another in pels grey and pink, aud two
friends in light blue and white laco. Some fifty oonples
were pre»ent, and t most remr.lmd - ill nearfy four o’clack

The first social evening of the Newcastle
Liedertsfel took place'in the City Hall on the 28r,h ult.
There was a large audience, and between tbe parts
refreshments.were hamdel round. Speaking freely,
many ot th* piece* were fairly given, the choruses wer*
not of a difficult class, but discord was not entirely
absent. The chorus "Banish, oh maiden," as »l>o
** Come away," was well rendered, and evoked an en-
core. Of the soloists, three were ladies, and one of the
fair singers, aetrangortoNewooetle, created enthusiasm
by her excellent performance. Signor Lardelli was
conductor,

On Thnr«day evening last, Captain and Mrs.
Miller reoelved a large party of friends on board the
g.B Cattrrthnn, at Smith's Wharf, Miller’* Poict, prior
to the departure of tke vessel for China. Flewer*,
evergreens, and bunting decorated the steam*r, and the
general arrangements tor the comfort of guests were
excellent. Dancing was the principal amusement, for
which the spacious main deck was suitably prepared.
Under a large awning running fore and aft Chinese
lanterns were suspended, while lamps hung romi4 the
sides of the ship. The saloon was *< t apart for refreih-
menta; excellent music waa provided; and at eight
bells a capital supper, prepared by the ship’s s'afl, was
served on the poop deck. After more dancing, A* , the
company ■eparated, just as tke comer, was becoming
visible. Mrs and Capt, Miller, as well a* the officers
of the vessel, used every exert! m to moke th* enter-
tainment a pleasant one, and " Anld Lauj Byne'*was
the finale.

Mr. and Mrs. Jones, of Tangley, Ashfield,
gave a most delightful dance on Fridiy 29th ultimo.
A large room and hall were admirably suited for the
purpose, ant about eighty guests carried on the dan.
cing with spirit till two o’clock, accomplishing twenty-
ens items, i • ostly waltzes. Mr. Saurbier presided at
the pian -, and his time was excellent. The kind
hostess wore a black sil* handsomely trimmed with
real! white lace, aud headdr-ss of lace and flower*.
Her two daughters were—one i* cream *atim and
bro’W, scarlet flow rs; the other in pure white,
pleasingly tasteful. A marriel lady from near the
line wore a magnificent cream and old. gold brocade
train. Bright cardinal suited a verv tail dark lady
well; and «. maiden, with short eurly locks, wore a
beautiful white satin, trimmed with white jet and
floss lace. A pale cream surah sil*, with old go d
I rochd and Spanish lace was e egant; ani pearl satin
became a bride. Many pretty d esses, too numerous
to mention Though some couples were all for-lawr,
yet they were not unhappy.

Asa financial speculation, the People’s Ball at
the Exhibition con la have not mode its promoters rich
—unless about 200 half-crowns w*«ld do it It was
hardly a success, either; for the fair wer* lacking. There
was about half a one to *aoh young man Neither of
these cironnaatanoes. probably, was tne fault of th*
"joint secretaries," who, to do them fsirncs-, con-
ducted their inexpensive shlvoo in a creditable style.
Order was well observed, a*d everyone <ook his hat off
on entering. Like a peppy is a cornfield, a so itary
c'awhammor shone resplendently, thn only one of its
kind. To make up for this oneness of dress coat, some
guests bed overcoats; some had r o coat*. Two gentle-
men pr< santed an extremely disllngiU sppearanre
though it was uncertain wtielhet toey wore lo readois
in lull flv, «r on.y those ui.ful Co»poration i ffl -,ers who
turn on" the waterplngs. Their habllimant* com-isied
of a suowy embroidered sh’rt, cream calico pants with
silver stripes, blue sashes, Bilk stockings « u piinfully
emu-like limM, and ladies’ boots with clinkers under
ihe foot; stiff collate and hair oil. Fewdre'fes wars
coetlv. For instance, a magenta Batin seemed to have
exhausted the fair wearer's pur*e, and ihe had finished
off with purple wincey. A gay atlk brocld w*r* by a
pert little votary with a regular " roy-ooloui»l ” kind of
strut, hid probably bee* h*r big sister's, and w«« out
down for its second owner. A matron in black bad
that peouliarly bulky app»Rra«oe sugroetive of a »n»tle
all round. A maroon velvet body glared dowa on a.
peagreen muslin skirt; and a pink tl-zed calico
blushed modestly beneath a covering of white morqalte
net. Jack Tsr was revolving with a stout Udy rnoa«*d
in nioely starched white piqufi, embellished apparently
with obarooal sketches; am wo thought of "theslati
of granite sogroy" that the poet talks a out, every
time a tall atteuoatid damsel in a pepper coloured
alpaca went gliding by. An attractive little character
iu a fancy dresa of red and black tkirt, with white
mualin npperworks, was decidedly belle of the motely
throng, and a grand dancer. A youth not ns»d to
" people’s balls," asked her young man for an introduc-
tion, on which that astute individual replied—'’ Oh I
no; girls is scarce ’ere. As I bring her, I’m goln’ tc
keep her, and not let other coves ’ave her."

The Warrene Assembly Reunion, on Friday, waa
quite a jovial affair, and some forty oonples did an-
limited dancing. Waltze* prevailed, mn»lo woe per.
feet, and the company sociable. Evening Arena was
chiefly worn, a tall yoang lady im pink being noted for
her charms ; also a French Peasant, likewise lengthy vt
stature. A brown satin trimmed with cream lace wem
pretty; and a petite Pyrmont maiden oe a Scotch
Lassie was an exquisite dancer. Don Caesar de Bazan
was unhappy, because his stockings kept slipping down.
Owing to inexperience, he had omitted certain trfles—
not Don-ned enough, in fact. It is said "Warrene"
was the blackfellowa’ name fer the ground on which

sward"—which ia very nice in theory, and is, more-
over, recommended by the clergy. But a little of it ia
enough. The Pennant Hills Band played all dor—-yet

In New South Wales 68 73 per cent, of the
people are Protestants, and 27’55 per cent, are Catho-

Mr. Llewellyn Hartre, of Somersetshire, Eng-

flopping down on his kness and answering a dose of
uncomfortable quartos, he declared: “I, Llewellyn

sin, for which I de heteby ask ior» Irenes* of my fellow-
men and of the woman I have wronged, and of Almighty
God.” The " wronged woman,” however, is in gaol

in a real, personal manner; after which, death will be

Mr. Robert Butcher, Mayor of Woollahra
The subject of our sketch, Mr. Robert Butcher,
Mayor of Woollahra, who comes of an old Lan-
cashire family, was born in Liverpool, England,
in 1834. He left school at an early age to enter
the office of Messrs. Gibbs, Bright, and Co., and
remained there for three years, at the termination
of which period, in 1852, he came to Australia,
being attracted, like many others, by the news of
the rich gold discoveries of the time. He tried
his fortune with varying success at mining pur-
suits, but he found mercantile business more suit-
able, and, returning to Sydney, he entered the
warehouse of the late Mr. William Long, wine
and spirit merchant, of whose business he eventu-
ally became manager. On the death of Mr. Long,
in 1876, the business was transferred to Mr.
Butcher, and with good tact and enterprise it has
been very largely extended. At the International
Exhibition he was one of the jurors in an im-
portant section, the awards in which were signally
endorsed by popular approval. In 1878, Mr.
Butcher was elected an alderman of Woollahra,
and in 1881 was unanimously chosen Mayor;
and he is now for the second time iu
the place of honour. In 1880 he was elected to
the City Council by a large majority for Macquarie
Ward. One of his principal works in the Council
is his effort to improve the great thoroughfares of
the city without delay. To this end a Bill has
been sent to Parliament, authorising a loan of
.£200,000, and in the passing of this measure it is
proposed to re-form the principal streets with
wooden blocks or blue cubes. No more important
work forces itself on the attention of the Council
at the present time. In financial work Mr.
Butcher has proved himself of unusual ability, the
building societies and other kindred institutions
with which he has been intimately associated,
having been very successful.
Mr. James M'Guigan, Contractor for the
Prospect Water Works.
Our portrait this week is that of Mr. James
M'Guigan, the well-known contractor, whose
tender for tne great undertaking at the Prospect
Water Works was recently accepted. Mr.
M'Guigan was born in the County Down, Ireland,
in May. 1835. At the !age of sixteen he left the
paternal roof, and went over to Sutherland,
England, where, under the charge of an elder
brother, who was a successful road contractor, he
took his first lessons in the business of a con-
tractor for public works. In 1854, at the request
of another brother, Mr. Henry M'Guigan, wine
merchant, of Elizabeth street, Melbourne, he left
England and came out to Melbourne. At that
time, the rich gold discoveries distracted the
population from legitimate enterprise, and, like a
good many other hard-headed men who subse-
quently proved themselves the backbone of the
colony, Mr. M'Guigan tried his hand at mining,
and was unsuccessful. Ha returned to Melbourne,
and under the auspices of his brother, embarked
in road-making. The first work of importance he
contracted for was the large dam at Malmsbury,
in connection with what is called the “ Coliban
Water Scheme”; but, owing to partnership
differences, he retired from the contract soon after
the work began, and, is, therefore, in no way
responsible for any of the failures of that work.
He afterwards entered into a fourteen years’
partnership with Mr. George Young, during
hich time* some important works were carried
out by the firm, notably, the Stony Creek
aqueduct, which supplies the town of
Geelong with fresh water. This work con-
sists of a series of tunnels, iron flaming,
and open cuttings lined with brickwork.
The Ballarat and Creswiok railway, and the famous
and noisy Gong Gong dam to supply the city and
town of Ballarat with water were constructed
by this firm. The latter work has been
completed five years, and time has proved
that it has been well and faithtully executed.
Mr. M'Guigan was attracted to this city two years
ago by the numerous advertisements calling for
tenders for Government works ; and, after a few
trial shots, he got the range, and secured the
contract for the North-western railway extension,
Gunnedah to Narrabri, which, in conjunction with
his old partner, Mr. Young, he has now nearly
completed. This brings our brief sketch down to
the more important contact —and, indeed, it may be
said, one of the most important works of the kind
in this hemisphere—the Prospect dam, which, in
his own words, he has taken on “a lone hand." A
few facts and figures may not be here out of place
in reference to this great work. The site of this
large reservoir is situate about six miles in a north-
westerly direction from Parramatta, and when the
watertight wall is completed will be capable of
holding 11,000,000,000 gallons of water. The earth-
ern wall that is to retain this enormous quantity
of water is designed to be 7000 feet long, and
80 feet high ; the cubic contents of which,
including earth, puddle clay, turfing, soiling, stone
pitching, and broken stone is nearly 3,000 000
cubic yards. The water is taken out of the re-
seyoir basin by means of pipes of large diameter
laid in a tunnel to be driven through the hill at the
eastern end of the dam, so that one of the common
errors in dam building—laying the pipes through
the _ earthwork of the damat its base—will be
avoided in this case, This error has been made in
the Yan Yean in Victoria and other places. The
works of the Prospect dam appear to be well and
ably designed and reflect the highest credit upon
the talented engineer who is responsible for them,
and we have no doubt that, as the execution has
fallen into the hands of an experienced contractor,
the result will be a complete success ; indeed the
public have_ a right to expect nothing less, for
failure in this instance would be nothing short of
a calamity. We have good reason to.believe that
no such catastrophe will happen.
Messrs. R. G-oldsborough and Co.’s Wool
Warehouses, Darling Harbour, Sydney.
We give in this issue of The Bulletin, an
engraving of the splendid new wool warehouses,
now about to be erected at the head of Darling
Harbour by the well-known firm of R. Golds-
borough and Co. This grand edifice will be the
most extensive pile of buildings of the kind in
Australia, and the enterprise in thus arranging to
meet the development of our great wool industry
is worthy the history of the firm whose name is
mentioned in connection with it. The extent of
the storage accommodation of the building may be
gathered from the following:—Tne warehouse
with frontage to Pyrmont-street is 354 feat long,
106 feet wide, five stories high, divided into two
warehouses, each 160 feet long and 106 feet wide,
the centre space between the warehouses being
for offices, except the top floor which is connected
with both warehouses with doorways closed with
fire-proof iron doors. The whole of the upper
floors in both warehouses will be used for exhibit-
ing the sample bales of wool, and will bo lighted
with continuous rows of windows 16 feet apart
facing the South. Over the whole area of the
root the windows will be glazed with rough rolled
plate glass, and will give a uniform diffused light
over the whole of the upper floor. Eight wool-
presses will be fixed on the upper floor, and the
lower floor will have hydraulic dumping presses.
There will be seven hydraulic lifts in the
warehouses, one of them being fitted as a
passenger lift. The lifts and presses will be
worked by a steam-engine fixed in the yard be-
tween the buildings. The whole of the buildii ga
will be constructed of stone, the^ floors supported
by iron columns and girders, designed so that the
side of girders and the under edges of ihe
floor-joists are flush, preventing the loss of space
caused by girders below the joists. There will be
six hundred iron columns iu the two warehouses.
The floors will be Kauri pine. The spaces between
the rows of columns are so planned as to allow
for a double tier of bales of wool and a passage
between each, the windows being po arranged aa
to light down the passages from each end. The
warehouse with a frontage to Harris-street,
Pyrmont, is 120 feet by 80 feet, five stories high,
and similar in every respect to the warehouse in
the adjoining street. It is estimated that the two
warehouses will have ample storage for fifty
thousand bales of wool, besides leaving room for
working, and the top floors for sample rooms. The
buildings have been designed and the plans pre-
pared by Mr. W. Pritchard, architect, Melbourne,
and will be erected under the superintendence of
Mr. W. W. Wardell, C.E., of this city. These
warehouses will not be completed for the coming
season, but will be ready for the wool season of
1883. Meanwhile, the firm have made arrange-
ments to sell the wool and other produce in the
Exchange, and show clips at the Central Wharf
warehouse, where excellent storage accommodation
has been secured. The buildings are lighted from
the roof like the Melbourne warehouse, showing
the wool to the greatest advantage. Every
facility is offered for the sale of wool in the Mel-
bourne market, if desired, the Company having
completed arrangements for the delivery at Mel-
bourne from Newcastle or Sydney railway stations
all wool at the extremely low rate of £1 per ton,
inclusive of insurance, &C/; and if the price is not
realized at Melbourne, all consignments are
shipped to London at an additional cost of only
10s. per ton. The Sydney branch of the firm’s
business is conducted at No. 1 Spring-street, the
manager being Mr. Waller. In conjunction with
the wool business, Messrs. Goldsborough and
Co. are now carrying on in Sydney the business of
stock and station agents, which important lines
are in the hands of Mr. George Maiden, recently
of the firm of Maiden, Hill, and Clarke.
Mr. E. R. Cole’s Book and Stationery
Warehouse.
WK give herewith an engraving of Mr. E. R, Colo’s
well-known book and stationery warehouse, corner
of George and King-streets. These premises have
been occupied by Mr. Cole for the past twelve
years, during which period a very extensive busi.
ness has been built up, the establishment being
made the great emporium of the metropolis for all
the latest publications and the most striking novel-
ties in artistic printing and stationery. For a
long period there was a great want in this colony
for a certain and regular supply of the moat
recently-published standard works on the indus-
tries of the country; and, some years ago Mr
Cole arranged to supply this want. The result
has been that Cole’s in King-street is now the
recognized house for practical works on grazing
farming, horticulture, gardening, engineering
ship-building, road-making, mining, building
finance, education and science generally. Most
of the works on these subjects have been supplied
at the figures ruling in London, and are trans-
mitted to all parts of the colonies by means of our
improved book-post system, at a merely nominal
cost. Mr. Cole has, likewise, arranged for the sim-
ultaneous production to the public in Sydney of all
new novels by the recognised English authors, and
a constant supply of the whole literature of the day
is obtained per each mail steamer. A few years a» J
Mr. Cole, seeing the growing taste for artistic
Christmas productions, arranged with a London
and Parisian house for the supply of these novel-
ties each year. Last Christmas Mr. Cole placed
before the public a unique collection of this
description of goods, and the success was far
beyond expectation. For the approaching season
more extensive arrangements have been made and
some of the shipments being already to hand.’The
style and design all through are thoroughly
Australian ; and for artistic finish and cheapness
no attempt is likely anywhere to approach them,
Nor is the stationery business overlooked. In
this department the business of the house is very
large, a most varied and valuable stock bei g

The Clarendon Hotel, Park and Elizabeth
Streets, Sydney.
The neighbourhood of Park and JElizabeth-streets
has undergone a great change during the laso
few months, for here we find some of the dingiest
houses m Sydney displaced by the fine ware
houses and an hotel that is, at least, equal to
the pressing requirements of this go-a-head
metropolis. The Clarendon Hotel, which is here-
with illustrated, is situated at corner of
Elizabeth and Park streets, and was opened
recently, for the first time, by Mr. A. Gorman,
for years known in connection with a most suooess-
M £ ostelry 8t i nver ell. The Clarendon is built
on pi anB greatly beyond what is required, even
present strict law, the intention of the pro-
prietor being to have an establishment, not only up
to ordinary local requirements,but one whiohshould
also prove a first-class family hotel, suited to the
numerous visitors to Sydney from our interior
districts. Thus the house, standing on a splendid
site specially suited to the business, has been so
constructed as to afford large first-class aocommo-
daiion to visitors or families—as many as
forty rooms being provided, with suites of
apartments, private departments, parlours,
drawing rooms, smoking and commercial rooms,
&o The bedrooms are capitally designed, being
large, well-lighted, and well-ventilated. And the
whole house from top to bottom is richly furnished
direct from the first Sydney warehouses, the apart-
monts for families being furnished like a home,
The dining room is a feature of the hotel, being
large and brilliantly lighted, with appointments to
match. The bar is very large—much more ex-
tensive than usual—and is richly decorated. In
the Park-street front is a very handsome bar for
the better class of trade—a desideratum long
wanted in the neighbourhood. A capital cellar
extends the whole length of the two bars. The
hotel is supplied with hot and cold water baths,
&o. The situation is unsurpassed, being directly
opposite Hyde Park, ensuring that its view can
never be obstructed, and the trams for the
suburbs, the Railway, and the Circular Quay,
pass the door every few minutes throughout the
day. In this respect the hotel has special attrao-
tions for country visitors ; and to men of business
from the country it has the recommendation of
being situated in the centre of the city. The views
from all parts of the house are both grand and
refreshing; the whole of Hyde Park stretches
before the view, giving to the hot* 1 the aspect of &
country residence. Mr. Gorman will be assisted
in the management of the hotel by Mrs. Gorman.
The architect for the building is Mr. C. H. May,
■who has been very successful in bis design.

Patent Portable Gas for Everybody.
The inventive skill of the age is fast adding to
the comforts and conveniences of life. If there
be one thing more than another that has troubled
human existence, it is the great question of light.
It is doubtless an admitted fact that houses have
been rendered uncheerful and sight impaired to an
immeasurable degree by the defective means long
at our command for actually “ lighting our dark-
ness.” The common experience ranges from the
penny dip to the unsavoury and dangerous kero-
sene, till at last it deals with ordinary coal gas,
which is either costly to lay down, costly to burn,
or not procurable at all. The Patent Portable
Gas, however, appears to be the desideratum of the
age—the one simple thing which must prove a
real boon to the household, the workshop, the office,
the street, the mine, the ship, &c. This patent
portable gas is so simple an affair, and so effec-
tually meets requirements, that it is astonishing
the invention has been so long delayed. The word
“ portable ” simply means that gas can be burnt
down a mining shaft or aloft on the mast of a
ship; can be supplied and used in the most
distant town or the most distant home —
away from gasometers or the trace of a coal bed ;
can be used in a dwelling with absolute safety
(no more danger, in fact) and removed with the
utmost facility and safety while alight from one
room to another. The gas gives a rich, steady,
white light of six times the brilliancy of kerosene,
and twice that of ordinary coal gas, and the saving
in its use is simply extraordinary. For instance,
two gallons of the fluid give a five-hour light for
one month at a cost of 4s. 6d., equal to 245. worth
of kerosene. The gas burns with great brilliancy
and freeness, and emits not a particle of odour. The
wall lamp shown in the engraving, bums 7\ hours,
costs 15s ; and one to burn 15 hours, costs 17s 6d.;
the globes, if required, being ss. extra The lamp
may be hung on the wall and removed from room
to room with great safety. Then there are gasaliers
suitable for drawing, dining, and billiard rooms,
churches, stores, hotels, &c. _ A three-light gasa-
lier is priced at 50f1., and two-light at 355. Lanterns
for mines, batteries, &c , are supplied at from 30s.
upwards. Each jet, it must be remembered, is
equal to about twenty candle power, or six kero-
sene lamps, and less than a quarter the cost.
Each light is quite independent of the others.
Lamps for hotels and shops are so supplied as to
allow of a portion to be used when required for
the dining-room, parlour, &o. No wicks are re-
quired. The reservoir has to be filled with the
non-explosive -fluid, and the lamp is ready for
use. At St. Leonards, in this district, one
of the churches has four of these simple wall
lights, which take the place of twenty-four
kerosene lamps, and give a much better light.
Testimonials of the most satisfactory character
are forthcoming from insurance offices, jewellers'
establishments, and newspaper offices, where they
have been found simple, safe, and brilliant. The
supply of fluid is guaranteed with each lamp, and
is furnished at 2s. 3d. per gallon, in cases of eight
gallons or tins of four gallons. With this extra-
ordinarily cheap and effective invention before
them, no country municipality should any longer
use the dismal kerosene; and there can be no reason
why the inland hotels and private mansions should
any longer be deprived of this boon of cheap and
brilliant light. The practicability of the thing can
be easily tested in any township or residence at an
expenditure of a few shillings. The street lamps
are so constructed as to allow of the reservoir giving
a supply of the fluid as long as the light is required,
so that half the labour of street lamps is saved.
The business of the Patent Portable Gas Company
is carried on at 52 York-street, Sydney. [Since
the above was written, Croydon Railway Station,
and the tramway terminus, have been lighted with
the Patent Portable Gas. The effect at Croydon
Station indicates that it is a complete success, and
must take the place of kerosene at all inland rail-
way stations. At the tram terminus the change
is a perfect boon to the department.]
Mes srs. Watson and Crane's Steam Brass
and Electroplating Works.
We give herewith a sketch of the plating room
at Messrs. Watson and Crane’s steam brass and
electroplating works, 336 Pitt-street. A very pro-
mising industry has been established here for some
time, and the success which has attended it has de-
manded new and extensive premises, which the
firm have just now completed. The works have
a considerable depth from Pitt-street. The rear
is occupied as a brass foundry, where there are
appliances of the moat modern description. Steam
power is available all over the premises, and the
most capable artizan skill procurable is always
employed. The work turned out has won numerous
prizes in very severe competition, notably the
beer-engines, brass or nickel-plated, which have
won the highest awards in this and the adjoining
colonies. All kinds of plumbers’ and engineers’
brass ware is kept in stock or made to order, and
the workmanship is admitted to be about the best
in the colonies. The nickel-plated beer engines
are supplanting all others in the market, having a
very elegant appearance, and being of excellent
workmanship and durability. In the upper portion
of the front establishment (see illustration)
he nickel-plating is carried on. This industry
was established, for the first time in this colony,
by Mr. Watson, and since his partnership with
Mr. Crane in January last no expense has been
spared to extend the facilities tor manufacture —
ensuring excellence and promptness in the execu-
tion of all work. The department for the plating
is furnished with several baths, and the nickel-
plating is deposited by the electro process, being
applicable to all metal surfaces. The plating is
cheaper than silver and far more durable, being of
the same hardness as iron, and it stands a great
amount of heat. The process is peculiarly adapted
for ship fittings, fire-irons, bedsteads, surgical and
dental instruments, swords and scabbards, bits
and spurs, bath fittings, name-plates, and all
other metal goods exposed to wear. The nickel-
plating is applied with marked success to shop-
fronts, which are fitted up in this novel style,
complete at the works. The whole of the brass
saloon fittings of the Coonanbara have been
nickel-plated at these works, and the appearance
of the saloon is improved very much thereby.
Other similar work is to follow. In addition to
the nickel-plating, a large quantity of silver-plat-
ing is done on the works, and old electro-plated
ware of every description—spoons, forks, cruets,
salvers, Ac. —are re-silver-plated equal to new at
very reasonable prices. Silver-plated copper
sheets are also produced here, and they have
proved themselves greatly superior to the ordinary
copper-plate, both in gold-saving properties and
simplicity of management. Every description of
carriage and buggy ironwork, such as cabflies,
dash rails, lamp brackets, &c. are plated, the
work being of a very superior description. Gild-
ing of jewellery, and other similar articles is done
at the establishment in a very superior style.
Messrs. D. & R. Bradford's Foundry.
The foundry and engineering works of Messrs.
D. and R. Bradford are situated in Elizabeth-
street, near Bathurst-street and in Liverpool-
street, near Pitt-street. The extent to which
operations have been carried in both these estab-
lishments shows that the city is fast becoming a
great manufacturing centre, the factory or work-
shop displacing the residence, and pushing the
population out to the expanding suburbs of the
metropolis. The premises in Elizabeth-street are
mainly used for foundry work, where every
branch of the trade is exercised; but the better
description of engineering is likewise done, the
appliances for the purpose being very superior.
The foundry work includes the new description
of lamp-posts, palisading, steam chests, piping,
girders, and the general trade —the workmanship
throughout being as good as can elsewhere be
found in the colonies. On the premises are
seven blacksmiths’ forges, operated upon by a
fan ; and there are also a powerful steam hammer,
drilling, planeing and shearing machines, lathes
&c., all driven by ten h.p. engine. The works in
Liverpool-street are very extensive, and the
heavier castings are executed there. The prin-
cipal portion of the casting, in fact, is done in
Liverpool-street, and the fitting carried on at
the Klizabeth-street works. All descriptions of
builders’ ironwork are executed at both estab-
lishments.

Some years ago a fire occurred at a North
Queensland branch of a Sydney bank, and about £2OOO
was stolen. There was for a long while no trace of the
missing coin. That money has since found its way to
Sydney, and the th ief is well off in this city.
An immense number of conditional purchases in
this colony have been taken up by proxy. A land agent
or the super, of a station takes them up in the name of
bis absent employer. According to the Act this course
is thoroughly illegal, and holders of ground acquired
in this way have virtually no title to it.
Writes a correspondent“ Here’s a hint for
Insurance Companies: Supposing a man at the age of
30 insures his life for £lOOO. The Company agree to
pay him the whole sum on attaining his 60th year, or
one half to his heirs if he die in the meantime. Any
company bold enough to make this innovation would
put money in its coffers.”

The inhabitants of a Western town have
been for the last ten years making vigorous attempts to
get rid of their pastor and the organist. But they are
a couple of Mr. Gregsburys at retaining their appoint,
ments. To all written communications they merely say
“ Bah to you," and the interviews end very much in the
same manner as Mr. Pngstyles* deputation did to the
tenacious member of Parliament we have mentioned.
For instance : —“ • Then you will not resign, under
any circumstances ?’ asked the spokesman. Mr.
Gregsbury smiled, and shook his head. ‘Then,"
good morning, sir,* said Pngstyles, angrily. ‘ Heaven
bless yonl* said Mr. Gregsbury. And the deputation,
with many growls and scowls, filed off as quickly as
the narrowness of the staircase would allow of their
getting down.’"
If this story is new, laugh at it, and applaud it.
If it is not new, then its age at least will entitle it to
respect. Ada Ward is, it is well known, now doing the
States, only, we are grieved to state, receiving a
moderate meed of pecuniary support. On arriving,
recently, at rather a bad show town, the gifted lady was
surprised to And a full house, and with pardonable
pride called the manager to her and drew his attention
to the fact that she had been the first star to draw a
profitable audience in Blocktown within the memory of
the oldest inhabitant. The manager merely smiled, and
the play, which was “ The Woman in Bed,” in due
course came to an end. When the actress regained her
dressing-room, she found one of the local day bills
spread out on the table. Then she saw that the printer
*Lad blundered for her profit. He had announced the
piece as “ The Woman in Bed.”
Here is a case for the breach of promise aboli-
tionists. Away in the Par North, on the shores of a
shining river, there is a young sugar-planter, who, in
an unguarded moment, oast eyes at the long daughter
ef a solemn-faced eld storekeeper. He never bad a
chance from the beginning. Now she smiled, and now
with witching coyness she repulsed the ardent youth.
She drew him out like one of Cripps’s waiters would a
soft cork; and he popped. Her respons* was prompt;
she snapped him up with the swift tenacity of a crab’s
grip, or a double-action spring rat-trap. And now he
is a suicidal man. Her coyness is gone, so is £5O he
lent to her funeral-faced old Fa, handsome presents are
•‘ put down to his account,” he has to take her ont
every day and court her in the old man's presence nine
nights a week, and she has industriously told all her
friends that “ he insists on being married very soon.”
That is how matters stand at present; and the sugar-
man is weighing whether he’ll knock under and be hen-
pecked, or go to conrt as the “ruthless trifler with
virgin innocence.”
He was musical and genial; he was round and
sleek, and took not only a little, bat a great deal of
God’s “ good creatures ” for his “ bingey’s ” sake. He-
was on his way to fulfil an invite to a dinner, which be
knew would be one of the most “rekerky” in the
country town where he hung out. He neared hie des-
tination, when, squeezing his “full round belly”
through a fence, which barred a short out, his glossy
black pants, a tight fit withal, “ got tore,” just when
and where they shouldn’t. The situation was dreadful,
but that dinner ahead rendered him equal to it. Ex-
panding his umbrella (his constant companion), and
passing its handle between his “ pins,” as youngsters
do sticks, playing “ horsey,” he made sail ahead, the
expanded gingham gracefully enshrouding bis rear.
Five minutes after a number of the gentler sex were
amazed by the appearance of this ludicrous figure on,
the verandah, while, with a hurried “ 'Sense me,
ladies. I’ve had an accident 1” the dinner devotee made
a dash for the nearest room. Explanations followed
through the key-hole, and, after getting repaired and
copper-fastened, the genial and musical steamed ont of
dock, and hove in a dinner cargo that bade fair to
wreck any fabric but a patent corrugated moleskin. A
fact.
Details of a de.iberately-planned and ghastly
murder are from Paris. The murderers were Marini
Penayron, his wife Oabrielle, and his brother Luoien.
Their victim was Louis Aubert, a chemist in the Boule-
vard Malesherbes, formerly an apprentice to Fenayron,
and the lover of the latter’s wife Gabrielle. Early m
May of this year Fenayron discovered his wife's in-
fidelity, and as the price of her life and that of n®
children, as she alleges, made her decoy Aubert to a
lonely house at Chateu, five miles from Pa is. T “ 6
three assassins supped well and cheerfully at a neigh-
bouring restaurant. The decoy Gabrielle then spent
half-an hour on her knees in a chapel hard by,
her accomplices went to make ready for their victim-
Aubert met Gabrielle; went to Chatou; togetn®
they entered the honse, which they found in darkness.
Aubert was striking a match when the Fenayron
behind made 8 sadden attack, the one with a heavy
hammer, the other with a sword-cane; a struggle she
and sharp followed, and the man was killed. Th o
was then doubled in two, a long leaden gas-pip o w .
wrapped round it, the mouth gagged by a cloth
with a pin through the lips; and, finally, the body w
g laced in a perambulator and wheeled to one ot i
eine bridges, whence it was thrown into the waber .'
was found floating near Paris on May 29. Suspi« _
falling on the Fenayrons, they were arrested, and tn r
at once confessed. The wife was married toh or ‘
band in 1870, and is now thirty years old. 1161 zL.
Lucien's plea was that they acted entirely on®
pulsion, and from fear of Marin Fenayron. At . 0
proved that the woman held Aubert’s arms wtu»
was fighting for his life with the two Fenayrens.
