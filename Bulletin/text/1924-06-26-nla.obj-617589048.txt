AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and find
themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s Eumea-
thol Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties prevent
abnormal fermentation of the food, thus allowing the natural digestive ferments to act,
and if taken regularly after meals they so
improve the digestion that a strict diet be-
comes unnecessary. Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes are most useful to those who suffer
from Heartburn, Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

The Red Page
Katherine Mansfield
She will come back—she will come back
again
And linger here among our leafy ways,
When tuis sing their gay-glad song of praise
To lovely Spring and all her merry train.
When sweet, expectant notes of love and pain
Trill out their message, she will come to gaze
On what we, purblind, see but through a haze
And only dimly hear in minor strain.
’Neath moonless skies, her little torch held
high,
She’ll walk afar through dusky forest trees,
Where baby owls give out their w'istful cry
And night is full of husky melodies.
Only nocturnal things, like kiwis shy,
Will see her pass on misty nights like these.

R. E. RAWLINSON.
The Essay
A recent Red Page essay was devoted
by its writer to a denunciation of all essays
whatsoever, and a depreciation of essay-writ-
ing—which, by the way, lie called a “lost
art.” Most egregiously he selected for his
flagellation such masters of the essay as
Charles Lamb and William Hazlitt, though
ho conceded to them “pale grace and languid
edification.” This sort of qualification ap-
plied to the writings of Lamb is absurd on
the face of it; whilst as to Ilazlitt, his work
displays a vehement red-meat substantiality
it is impossible to mistake for anything else,
and his utter lack of pallid gracefulness puts
him in the very front rank of the virile flesh-
eaters of an age no less vigorous than our
own—an age whose vigor was more muscu-
lar, and emphatically less neurotic.
To proclaim essay-writing a “lost art” is
a patent absurdity. Every day, the wide
world over, thousands of pens are occupied
in writing essays for the daily press and the
periodical magazine—albeit they appear as
“leading articles.” But what, in the first place,
is an essay? Dr. W. T. Harris defines it as
being a piece of writing which is distin-
guished from a treatise or a dissertation in
being less systematic and formal; from a
thesis in not being restricted to formal argu-
ment; and from a history or a biography in
treating its subject in a single aspect rather
than in its whole scope. Yet even an
entire book, as Locke’s “Essay Concerning
Human Understanding,” or a long and com-
plex poem, as Pope’s “Essay on Man,” has
been so designated. Thus it happens that
some of the most valuable and permanent con--
tributions made to the literature of all civil-
ised nations, and particularly to English
literature, have been in the form of the essay.
Alexander Smith, the author of “Dream-
thorp,” wisely considered that Addison’s
“Essay in Westminster Abbey” was more
valuable than his tragedy, “Cato,” and that
Macaulay’s “Clive” and “Warren Hastings”
were as brilliant, as powerful and as instruc-
tive as any single chapter of his “History”—
with the additional advantage that they
could be read at a sitting. Sedulously as the
English have cultivated the art of essay-
writing, its great inspirer must be looked for
in France, in Michael Eyquem, Sieur de Mon-
taigne, whom Sainte-Betive styled the Horace
of France. Bacon, first of English essayists, re-
flects the thought of Montaigne—a proof of
how rapidly the French writer’s influence
spread, considering the intellectual leisureli-
ness of the period; for Bacon was only some
30 years of age when Montaigne died at
almost 60. Ben Jonson, in his “Discoveries,”
was rather a translator and re-arranger of
sententious paragraphs from classical sources
than an original essay-writer; but his style
has all the vigor of a strong mind. Though
not regarded properly as an essayist, Robert
Burton, of “The Anatomy of Melancholy,”
produced a book which is a collection of
essays about everything that ever entered
the author’s old curiosity-shop of a mind.
Thomas Fuller is another essayist who did
not write essays; but he is orderly, precise,
wise, sententious, profound and sometimes
witty. It is Cowley who revives the tradi-
tion of Montaigne, and shows the world how
smoothly he can phrase in prose the thoughts
of one of the most crabbed poets in the
whole range of the metaphysical school.
Milton’s trumpet-blasting prose is almost too
sonorous for the essay-form, and personally
I must confess a wearisomeness from his very
strenuous pertinacity of vehemence; albeit
the “Areopagitica” contains some glorious
passages, and single great sentences shimmer-
ing like the flash of a scimitar. Sir Thomas
Browne is one continuous essay, of linked
sweetness long drawn out. Sir William
Temple w r as not a specially profound thinker,
but he was a charming writer—courtly, dig-
nified, genial, urbane, the perfect prose gentle-
man of a highly polite and ceremonious
epoch. John Locke's so-called “Essay” is
nearly a treatise; and his style has the great
merit of clear and precise exposition. John
Dryden is a writer of another sort —apart
from liis somewhat fulsome “dedications” his
prose is delightful, and his essays onklramatic
writing are a joy for ever.
The eighteenth century was the century
of the essay in excelsis. De Foe, of course,
the universal grey grandfather of all journal-
ism, is to the fore with the Review, which
he conducted, and of which he was practically
sole writer, from 1704 to 1713. But the
essay proper, according to Austin Dobson,
a not-to-be-questioned authority, began with
the Tatler, by “Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq.”—
the first number of which is dated “Tuesday,
April 12, 1709.” Its price was a penny, and
it was issued three times a week. After SO
numbers had appeared Steele was perma-
nently joined by Addison. It is computed
that four-fifths of the Tatler, the Spec-
tator and the Guardian was the work of
the two friends. Pope, the poet,
wrote a couple of papers for the Spectator.
Swift contributed twice or thrice. Between
the Guardian and Dr. Johnson’s Rambler
many essayists of varying merit appear—•
and disappeared. Philips projected the Free
Thinker ; Henry Fielding, the novelist, the
Champion (in conjunction with Ralph)
and the Covent Garden Journal —the last
appearing concurrently with Johnson’s Ram-
bler, which, in the sprightly phrase of Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu, followed the Spec-
tator as a “packhorse would do a hunter.”
Then came Dr. Hawkesworth (the editor of
Captain Cook’s “First Voyage”) with the
Adventurer, who got Dr. Johnson to assist
him in the periodical; followed by the lexi-
cographer’s own Idler, with its creation of
“Dick Minim.” With the exception of Gold-
smith’s Chinese Letters (“The Citizen of
the World”) in the Public Ledger, the most
noteworthy of the essayists of the period were
the World (1753-56) and the Connoisseur
(1754-56). Edward Moore, author of the
once-popular “Fables for the Female Sex,” was
the editor of the World. This became, as
one of its own writers puts it, “the bow of
Ulysses, in which it was the fashion for men
of rank and genius to try their strength”—
a journal “Written by gentlemen for gentle-
men.” Scottish contemporary essayists were
the Mirror (1779-80) and its sequel, the
Lounger (1785 87), projected and written
mainly by Henry Mackenzie, the Edinboro
“Man of Feeling.”
The nineteenth century opened with a bril-
liant band of essayists; for it was an era of
new poets, new factions ab 3 new reviews.
Samuel Taylor Coleridge was all Ms life a
journalist and an occasional lecturer and a
prolific producer of literature in the essay-
form. John Foster was a professional essay-
ist on moral and philosophic subjects. Sydney
Smith, with wit, logic, commonsense and
geniality, helped to found the Edinburgh
Review, and wrote delightfully on every-
thing, from Religious Disqualification to
American Blankets. But the two writers
who reigned without peers as social and liter-
ary, dramatic and artistic critics and com-
mentators were Charles Lamb and William
Hazlitt. Leigh Hunt, John Wilson (“Chris-
topher North”), De Quincey and others were
by this twain cast into relative shade. Car-
lyle, Macaulay, Ruskin and the younger gen-
eration whom these giants captained
were the unknowing heralds of a new order,
when the boundary-lines between literature
and journalism would be in peril of disappear-
ing with the new developments of the periodi-
cal press. But in Lamb and Hazlitt the
essay reaches the climax of its evolution into
a literary medium accommodated to all the
uses of accomplished and complete expres-
sion. And let it be said with emphasis that
as men they were no less teachers and exem-
plars than as writers. The tragedy of Lamb's
life is capable of teaching any modern young
man of the professional” or “mechanical”
(or any other) calling wonderful courage and
sublime endurance ; whilst the marital comedy
of Hazlitt’s life, with its alternating brandy
and teapot excesses, might teach courage of
another kind, but backed by a fighting spirit
and a bulldog kind of grim outlastingness
worthy of any cause that ever challenged the
constancy of man or the pride of philosophy.
FRED J. BROOMFIELD.
Too Much Kindness
Ever since Dickens wrote his sob-producing
tales of predatory pedagogues there has been
growing up the popular habit of decrying our
teaching methods as being out of keeping
with the supposed tenderness of the child-
body and the supposed innocence of the child-
mind. People have, indeed, so often said
that children should be taught softly and
cudgelled kindly—some of them have said it
lately on the Red Page—that many educa-
tionists have come to think so, and in some
parts of the world they have gone to the
very limit of possibility in an endeavor to
bring education into line with these supposed
needs of childhood. America is an outstand-
ing example of this. There are large sections
of that country where almost every whim of
psychology has been applied to teaching;
where the curriculum has been altered and
re-altered to fit every supposed new discovery
championed by sentimentalists. I spent some
of my childhood in those American schools,
where the classics are held lightly, and
where every new fad with any semblance of
scientific or sentimental - grounding is
eagerly put into practice. A large portion
of the present-day manhood of America has
been trained in such places, and their fruits
do not justify them. Those fruits are an
uneducated people who live entirely on the
surface.
A. S. Neal, in “A Dominie in Doubt,” brings
psycho-analysis to bear on this subject, and
while defending the faddists and advocating a
more faddish faddism than any, yet reveals
the' cause of the failure of such attempts.
He divides mankind into extroverts and
introverts, and points to the influences that
make for each state. The extrovert is the
person who is entirely at peace with his
surroundings. He throws himself into the
interests and doings of his fellowmen. He
lives on the surface, and acts instead of
thinking. The introvert withdraws himself
from life. He is at discord with, and to
some extent afraid of, his surroundings. He
lives within himself, in thought and in day-
dreaming. In this class are the artists, the
poets, the philosophers, the thinkers.
It is a hard but certain fact that con-
genial, kindly, sugary surroundings for child-
hood produce the extrovert. Finding the sur-
face of life pleasant, he lives there, and thus
lacks both the means and the incentive to
examine those surroundings critically, to
evolve a possible improvement of them, or to
add any new glow of beauty to what he finds
already so satisfactory. Of course, the extro-
vert is necessary, for it is he who does hard
and disagreeable work most willingly, and
it is he who, after a fashion, keeps the world
going; but a nation of extroverts is a nation
without the color of noble dreams, without
the splendor of art, without the grandeur of
high thoughts. Such a nation is the U.S.A.
with her reformed education.
The introvert is one who has been driven
inward upon himself-by encountering upon
the surface of life something bitter and fear-
ful and ugly. He has been disgusted or
appalled by these outward things and cannot
live at peace with them. He turns within
himself and seeks there for peace and mental
security. I suppose many of those who turn
inward find nothing but a barren waste. I
suppose the effect of social and educational
cruelty upon many is merely lifelong misery
and despondency. But that is because they

LESTER WAY.
The Dramatic Touch
Joseph Conrad, in an essay he once wrote
on “The Titanic Inquiry,” said of that dis-
astrous wreck that it was neither drama nor
melodrama, but the exposure of arrogant
folly. But what is drama at any time but
the' exposure of folly, and nearly always
arrogant folly? Man, dressed m his little
brief authority, and with all his attention
taken up with his little day-to-day affairs,
is very apt to forget that there is a Be-
yond, and that he is not a final and com-
plete thing in himself. He is apt to forget,
if indeed, he ever remembers, when he goes
down the street to catch a tram, that whether
he is to catch or miss that particular tram
was decided millions of ages ago. lie is
a puppet of Fate. This Fate sometimes re-
mains invisible to him for so long a time that
he is apt to forget its existence. It is the
dramatic artist who gives a form and color
to this Fate —the dramatic artist and his
master, Nature, the greatest dramatic artist
of all. , „ . .
In the drama the man, whilst still re-
taining his personality, ceases to be an m-
dividual and becomes a type. The eyes ot
the world are, as it were, focussed on
all his doings. He becomes a representative
of mankind. We don’t want to know, the
color of this man’s hair or his eyes. We
don’t want to know anything about his little
daily habits or what he likes to eat or
drink. If we know all these things about
him he becomes an individual. He becomes
one of us. And he must be all of us. He
is our representative in mankind’s fight
against the mysterious and “beyond forces
that have certainly got vastly more control
over us and our ultimate ends than we have
ourselves. Be he bad man or good man,
he is our hero, and the fight he wages is
our fight. It is the dramatist’s task to show
him putting up that fight. .
Shakspeare puts the witches rags and
faces upon Fate, and shows us Macbeth,
our representative, with the goodness and
badness and strength and weakness that is
in him, facing the inevitable that is fore-
told by those witches. And Nature in the
Titanic disaster and the Scott expedition
does what Shakspeare does. Scott and his
party going through the gateway to the
Beyond in the great, magnifying light that
Nature, disguised as circumstances, throws
upon them, cease at once to be just ordinary
men.
It is very difficult for the most imaginative
of us to put much feeling into the beings
of our imagination unless there is some-
thing very dramatic in their circumstances.
I see a man knocked down in the street,
and I immediately become the man knocked
down. I feel the pain he feels; I know
the fear. But if I read of the man being
knocked down, the reading leaves me un-
moved, unless the writer can put a dramatic
atmosphere into the writing. It affects
me more to see a dog killed than does the
reading of the bald newspaper accounts of
the Japanese earthquake. And it affected
me more to read of Lieutenant Warneford s
death after bringing down a Zeppelin and
being decorated by the King with the Vic-
toria Cross than it did to read a vague
statement that thousands of men were killed
in one day in the Battle of the_ Somme. The
dramatic artist makes the incident so near
that we immediately enter into it. Mac-
beth and Hamlet and Captain Scott and
the people on the Titanic faced the inevit-
able that we have all got to face, and be-
cause of the light that was focussed upon
them we saw them as I see. the dog killed
and the man knocked down in the street.
In London recently I was privileged to
see the American drama, “Anna Christie.”
This play, at its first appearance, was mis-
interpreted by practically all the dramatic
critics. They all cried, “But it has a con-
ventional ending,” and by saying this they
showed that what was really dramatic in
the play had escaped their notice. For
Eugene O’Neill is a true dramatist. . Cer-
tainly Anna and her man, seemingly inevit-
ably separated, do come together and marry;
but though this takes place at the end of
the last act, it is not the end of the play.
The ending is most unconventional. In
this play, Fate, the weaver of the inescap-
able destiny, is disguised as the sea. You
know before you have gone very far that
the sea will get these people, just as you
know that wliat the witches have foretold
will come true in “Macbeth.” Old man Chris
hates and fears the sea. It has taken all
his people, and made him its slave. But
he will escape from its clutches. He takes
a position in a barge that never goes out
into the sea, and he sends his little girl away
inland so that she will be safe. One can
almost hear the sea laughing. The . old
man’s planning to make the girl safe brings
her back to the sea he would save her from.
And, terrified, he notices the sea-fascina-
tion begin to stir in her at once. Then the
man from the sea comes to take her, and olu
Chris sees his doom approaching like an
inevitable vast tide. At the end the man
and the woman marry, but both the man
and old Chris have signed on to sail on a
long sea-voyage on the morrow. Anna and
the man drink and try desperately to throw
off the uneasy thoughts that have settled
upon them. Old Chris opens, the door of
the barge-cabin, and looks out into the night
and a sea-fog that has suddenly come up.
The play ends with him standing there shak-
ing his head and muttering, “Fog, fog, fog!
You can’t see vliere you vas going. No,
only dat old davil sea, she knows! while
the two others stare at him, and from the
harbor comes the muffled mournful wail of
steamers’ whistles. .
In melodrama the hero fights against the
villain and the villain’s puppets and machi-
nations. and the hero flways wins. But in
the real drama the hero fights directly
against Fate and the puppets and machina-
tions of Fate, and he always loses. But
a world of exaltation comes to us from
watching this hero fighting his losing fight.
That exaltation seems to suggest in-
stinctive awareness, deep down in all of us,
that some day man will win In's fight even
against Fate.

When Genius Nods
As to that Kipling spoof in London Times
< R.P. 12/6/’24), my sympathies have always
been with the editor. Kipling shares with
Byron the discredit of being criminally care-
less. (Byron said of himself, “I write as
the tiger springs,” meaning really that lie
would not revise his work.) Byron thought
any drivel was good enough to fling in the
face of a fool public, and Kipling, who, like
Byron, is a great artist in patches, is also
capable of complacency about utterly rotten
work. “A Song of French Roads in the
current Strand is an example. The last
two lines of the first verse contain the re-
frain and the motif —such as the latter is:
Now praise the gods of Time and Chance
That bring a heart’s desire,
And lay the joyous roads of France
Once more beneath the tyre—•
So numbered by Napoleon,
The veriest ass can spy
How Twenty takes to Bourg-Madame
And Ten is for Hendaye.
A promising beginning, but the poem tails
off into a meaningless litany of place-names
which could be bettered, for euphoniousness,
by a reference to the nearest collection ot
champagne-bottles: —
The dust is white at AngoulGme,
The sun is warm at Blaye;
And Twenty takes to Bourg-Madame
And Ten is for Hendaye.
There is no significance about either of the
frontier towns he stresses, except that roads
lead to them, which is a common enougn
phenomenon. He excuses his rhyming, which
is barbarous, by putting “English accent in
brackets under the title, let if Hendaye
rhymes with “spy” in English, it certainly
does not with “Cambrai,’ which the msulai
Briton pronounces “Cambray, ’ and by no
means can it be made to harmonise with
“Versailles.” The English sound the second
s in this word (“Vursayles ) ; the French
don’t. On the other hand the French make
Hendaye a word of three syllables, which
might be written phonetically Ondayer.
But worst of all is “Bourg-Madame. In
French it is a beautiful word: m English
( “Bourg-J/etddam”) it is hideous and does
not scan. By every test this is a fifth-rate
poem, and any editor would justified in
rejecting it as a parody on Kipling—which.,
of course, it is. He is often his own cruellest
parodist.
J. B. D.
Penny Poets
In 1915, while travelling by the Manawatu,
I met a personality of great interest. My
new acquaintance was a jeweller, with incli-
nations towards adventure. No corner ot Aus-
tralia was foreign to him. At parting he pro-
duced with pride a sheet ot printed matter
a poem written by himself and sold tor
threepence in aid of the Patriotic h und. Phis
poem, destined to be the nucleus of my col-
lection of Penny Poets, was entitled bons
of the South.” Its merit can best be judged
by an extract: —
Let us hope the war will soon be o’er
And give them back their liberty,
And bring them back to their own dear native home,
In health, wealth and prosperity
They take one last look on that gloomy battlefaeld
Where lie comrades in their lonely graves.
Let us sing that song, see our Conquering Heroes
come, , ~
And dear old Britain always rules the waves.
Since acquiring this first example, I have
gradually accumulated a collection consisting
entirely of broadsheets of this type, pur-
chased sometimes in small suburban shops,
sometimes from street vendors or itinerant
beggars, sometimes direct from the authors
themselves. Roughly speaking, they may
be divided into four classes—personal,
narrative (usually pathetic), patriotic (re-
member that this collection was accumulated
from 1915 to date), sporting and general
(nearly always humorous).
Among the personal poems, we have ' bad
Blasting Accident at Brunswick, Victoria,
by which lost his sight at the age of
23”: —
It is a sad storv to-night we must relate,
How John’s young life was blighted by that sudden
stroke of fate;
But hope’s bright star will rise once more, with its
bright, cheering ray, , . ... ,
And newer sounds through ear and brain will make
night like the day. .
A sudden trembling then took place, which caused
those rumbling shocks
That shook the ground on every side, and split those
bluestone rocks.
In life all sorts of accidents will befall the human
race,
And on the fourteenth day of March this happened in
John’s case.
Another poem of the personal type is en-
titled “A Poem of Part of Capt. Mac ’s
Experiences, from the age of 14 to the year
1901,” and apparently deals with incidents
in the life of the author, a retired naval
man. The style is well indicated by the
opening stanza (there are 15 altogether) :
I have written you a ditty of my past and present
life,
It helps to occupy my mind since l lost my cherished
wife.
I joined the British Navy when I was but fourteen,
At twenty-four I served ten years for our late Most
Gracious Queen.
And then I went to school to be taught to navigate,
And received twelve months’ teaching' when I shipped
as Second Mate;
The ship she was a clipper, and the Captain’s name
was Clarke—
She was a well-known vessel and was called the Cutty
Sark.
Of patriotic poems there are many in the
collection, representing an amazing variety
of themes. There is a sonnet, or, at all
events, a 14-line poem, “To the Kaiser, on
the sinking of the Lusitania” :
Ah, Ah, Mad Kaiser, now you’ve sealed your doom —
This one mad act may cast the world in gloom;
And you may laugh and chuckle at the crime,
And laugh your mad laugh for a little time —
But God will punish you and yours. It’s true. ...
A most affecting song is entitled “It’s a Long
Way to Dear Australia.” The last verse: —
He knew that he was dying, for the doctor shook his
head,
And nurse was looking tenderly beside him at his
bed;
He heard his comrades singing as they gently passed
along,
He saw their heads all drooping, as they sang this
touching song.
Surely a most pathetic picture of the Aus-
tralian troops at the Front! But if one
may be permitted to ask it, why was the
nurse loooking tenderly at his bed?
Dying soldiers were very popular with
these writers; witness “The Dying Soldier”:
The Transport sped on to the scene of the slaughter,
And landed our boys near the thick of the fray.
Our Hero was shot at the Dardanelles Battle,
Kell mortally wounded, and dying did say:
“Give this watch to Mother, my poor darling Mother,
And send little Daisy my locket and chain,
The rest kindly send to my poor wife and brother,
For God has denied me to see them again.”
Or again (from “What Australia’s Sons
Can Do”) :
Oh, Mothers, wives and sisters dear,
Be brave and do not weep,
Your loved ones are not truly dead
But in a peaceful sleep,
They have only just gone on before,
To watch and wait for you,
And this is perhaps the noblest thing
That Australia’s sons can do.
From “Australian Anzac Boys” we learn that
Australian Anzac Boys stowed away all tools and toys
To rally round the dear old Union Hag;
They have proved to all that’s worth there’s no braver
band on earth,
All bom for deeds they never say or brag.
Our boys went out for gore, and they are thirsting
for it more,
Dare-devil boys they are to gather fame,
High-born, with firm warm feet, they have never yet
known defeat,
Bold Australians always play a winning game.
The “firm, warm feet” perhaps reach the
sublimest heights of the whole collection.
Another delightful stanza is provided by a
gem entitled “The Splitter’s Dream,” in
which the growing realisation of his duty
leads the splitter to the following:—
Now, Mother, I have enlisted,
My action do not resist,
But let me have your blessing
Sanctioned with a kiss.
My son, you have my blessing;
Arise from off your knees,
May you be as good at falling Germans,
As you are at cutting down the trees.
Sporting poems are almost invariably con-
cerned with horseracing and frequently give
tips. We have thus “A Dream of the Nevv-
market Handicap,” “Caulfield Cup Acrostic,”
and so forth. Most of these naturally lose
much of their point as time goes on, but
there will always be pleasure in store for
the reader of "Honest Australian Jockeys
Killed on the Turf” :
McGowan (Chirnside’s jockey)
Old timers all must know,
Was killed while riding Linburn
Some twenty years ago.
'Phis honest, clever jockey
(Whose Christian name was Pat),
Was skilful over fences
As well as on the flat.
Frankie Kuhn —great horseman
(Though only quite a dot)—
Met sudden death at Randwiek
(Was accidentally shot).
General poems naturally treat of many
subjects, including “Human Kinship,” “Syd-
ney Bed Bugs” and “Kookaburra.” “Sydney
Bed Bugs,” we are informed, is a humorous
recitation: —
Old Sydney fairly beats us
For “harbor,” “parks” and “trees,’
She also takes the pancake
For lively “bugs and fleas.”
The subject is elaborated in 14 verses.
Confusion of meaning is best illustrated
by the following lines from “The Splitter s
Dream” :
The Splitter’s axe is falling
Far down the distant glen,
The forest giants crashing
Earthwards now and then,
The gaily-plumaged parrot
Is swinging on the bough,
But he only sees his mother,
For he is dreaming of her now.
No better example of mixed metaphors has
ever been quoted than the following lines,
from “Human Kinship” :
Time, like a mighty river, speeds
Our onward course to where it leads
In the great ocean of our lives
Like busy bees in different hives.
One of my favorite authors once wrote to
me in reply to a letter of mine: “I do not
sing to the birds and fishes. I simply write
for a living, and a child could do them as
well. Poets who write to the stars and moon
no doubt write very deep, but they also
sigh very deep, as they do not sell. So my
works are very simple but also very, very
saleable.” This, I think, sums up the whole
object of these penny poets and, in part,
explains the reason for their apparent com-
plete satisfaction with their art.
A. A. ROSENBLUM.
“A.G.L.”: David McKee Wright in his article
“To a Finish” (B. 22/5/’24) omitted to m<ntion
the pioneer in this literary by-way. What enthusi-
astic admirer of Ivanhoe but can be grateful to
Thackeray for taking up, in his delightful “Rebecca
and Rowena,” the cudgels on behalf of the rejected
Jewess and giving her, what Scott did not, a square
deal ? I was only a youth when I first read this,
and now, after half a century, am still convinced that
the last chapter of Scott’s work should be removed
and Thackeray’s version substituted. What more
probable than that the somewhat insipid Rowena
should have developed into a blowsy, nagging wife?
Or that Ivanhoe, now fat and indolent, should at
last have became full up of it, and with his witless
but equally disgruntled dependant chucked the whole
business and struck out for the Levantine Never-
never in search of sympathy? Or that, meeting
his old love, he should have conformed to her
religion, married her and died, full of years, a
revered and learned Talmudist! Scott would never
have Written powerfully enough to convince one that
the whole auair did not end exactly as Thackeray
suggested.

Why are Goodyear Heavy
Duty Cushions Better?
The Goodyear All-Weather
1 read Heavy Duty Cushion
Tyre (replacing the All-Weather
Tread Solid Tyre) embodies
many improvements which
greatly increase its efficiency.
For example:
1. It has been made wider across
the tread. This gives a wider
cushioning surface, and thus
increases the traction
qualities.
2. It now cushions better, for
the rubber when under
pressure has a natural and
larger outlet for flow in the
wide, deep grooves of the All-
Weather Tiead, and in the
small cups on the sides.
3. The diamond blocks are now
somewhat smaller, thus per-
mitting of more rows of them
on the tread. This presents
more edges to prevent skid-
ding.
These changes—an increase in
width, smaller diamond blocks,
more rows of blocks, and the
addition of the small cups in the
sides—combine to make the
Goodyear All-Weather Tread
Heavy Duty Cushion Tyre
betterthan any SolidTruckTyre
you have ever known bef re.
Goodyear means Good Wear.

Again Proves
GREATER POWER
STRONGER BRAKES
BETTER SPRINGING
THE ability of the Overland car to go
wherever you want it to go, no matter
how rough the road or steep the grade,
was again proved beyond any shadow of
doubt on Wednesday, June 4, when Mr. Victor
Salek paid a visit to the Sydney Town Hall
by driving in his Overland Car (a stock
model) up the two steep flights of steps to the
Druitt Street entrance.
One of Sydney’s leading motorists and the driver of a high-
powered six-cylinder car learnt of the driver s intention and
said: “Impossible! An Overland has not sufficient reserve
power, large enough brakeing surface or strong enough springs
to perform such a feat and withstand such a strain.
Imagine the motorist’s surprise when he watched the sturdy
little Overland quietly mount the two flights of steep steps
with practically effortless motion. So enthusiastic did he
become that in company with many others he said, I m going
to wait and see the descent.” He did not have to wait long,
for in a very feiw moments Mr. Salek quietly emerged from
the Town Hall accompanied by a friend, and taking their
seats in the Overland, the driver moved off to descend as
though it was an everyday occurrence to travel up and down
stairs in his car.

|
THE OVERLAND travelled down with
the greatest ease, although at times
it seemed to the onlooker as though
it would topple because of the sheer angle,
yet the driver knew his car better than
to think such a happening at all likely, and to
prove to his passenger the wonderful brakeing
power he even pulled up twice during the
descent.
Needless to say quite a crowd had gathered round the Town
Hall during this unusual episode, and the Overland became
an item of close inspection to find out if it was any the worse
for its peculiar journey, but so perfectly intact and unhurt
was it that it quickly answered to the driver’s touch and sped
away down George Street. One interested spectator was so
thoroughly convinced of what an Overland was capable that
he went straightaway to the Agents and bought one, saying,
“That’s the car for me, because my roads are nearly as bumpy
as the Town Hall steps. Greater Overland Power, strong
Overland Brakes and Overland Patent Triplex Springs—which
no other car possesses, are the reasons for this Overland doing
what no other car has ever done.

THE NEW BEALE PLAYER-PIANO
IN any of the arts individuality is the distinguishing feature of artistic
performance. Personality has lifted the motion picture film from the
humble niche where motion itself was sufficient to produce the whole effect,
till to-day the movement of the artists is completely submerged in the prob-
lems, loves and hates of the characters themselves. The player-piano, in
much the same way, has developed until instruments may now be obtained
which enable the greatest degree of personality to be expressed.
The New Beale Player-Piano is an instrument
of the strictly interpretative type. The piano
fulfils every dynamic demand of virtuosity and
the tone control is absolute. Many manually
proficient musicians have a technical limitation
which places the enjoyment of personally play-
ing many very lovely but difficult compositions
completely outside their experience. This does
not happen to the owner of the New Beale
Player. It is a complement to his musical
knowledge that has no limitation of execution.
To the full extent of one’s understanding the
instrument instantly responds.
For those musically minded people who wish to use
the New Beale in its fullest interpretative character,
we have created a Service Division with which are
associated some of the best known concert pianists
resident in Australia. Almost all of the great piano-
forte compositions, along certain broad lines, have
methods of interpretation that are endorsed by the
musically educated. It is the work of the Beale Ser-
vice Division to expound the great masters’ work to
the Beale Player-Owner who may not be familiar
with the accepted interpretation of a particular
composition.
Thus is obtained, not merely a piano that has been
endorsed by many eminent musicians as a concert
instrument of the highest type, and a techique that
years of arduous practice could not hope to rival, but
contact with the intellectual side of music is also
acquired. And no acquaintance with the arts, least
of all music, can give the utmost pleasure if the in-
tellectual aspect is neglected.
The New Beale is encased in Walnut, Rosewood, Mahogany
or other rare woods to order. Sold on a liberal Extended
Payment Plan and used pianos accepted in partial exchange.

What protean beauty lies
Just beyond the sight of eyes '....
Ah, those mountains, spirit-blue!
No unwinged feet may pursue
Peril where, like dragon’s teeth,
Peaks that know no forest-sheath
Pierce the level morning’s flood,
Red as roses or as blood.
Walls of lapis lazuli
That uphold the bow-bent sky,
Fall of waters downward poured
Like a league-long silver cord,
Ranges piled on naked ranges
In a dawn that never changes! .
What should scale these heights of air
But the pinioned steeds that bear
Valkyr-riders? Stallions white,
Screaming on the hills of light.
In immortal morning-flight,
Mine your splendor and your speed —
Stripped, helmed, raptured, body-freed....
droves that check th’ expectant breath,
Temples of enchanted death!
Oil, the silence! Underfoot
Matted violets spread their sweet.
Mirk more thick than middle-night:
Fear twin-born with strange delight!
Fain am I to be afraid
Where the column-crowded shade,
Like a shrine with opened doors.
Shows dark, fragrant threshold-floors.
Who would not hunt Mystery —
She, the sphinx of ecstasy?.. ..
Have you trodden colonnades
Where a light that never fades
Bids the golden marble glow?
There the titan stairways go
With their thousand steps of snow;
There smooth Doric pillars tower
Where the first cloud-tendrils flower.
Tireless, timeless, lightly pace
All this dream-desired place.
With the rolling panther play,
Note the married night and day;
But for one thing only feel
Awe that makes the spirit kneel—
Here blind love alone is wise.

The Journey.
With rosy hands held up in hail
The new day shouts its greeting;
But sunshine wall not quite prevail
Till Nancy keeps our meeting.
The shadows sink, a sudden beam
Upon her pane is falling;
But Nancy does not seem to dream
That day and love are calling.
Full many leagues have we to go
Till, down where grasses quiver,
We lie on banks with sun aglow
Sloped gently to the river.
Full many leagues to-day shall we
Walk in the lands of fancy
Where flowers of thought shall tell for me
The love I have for Nancy.
We’ll climb those hopes whose rosy crown
Lures to the view far-flinging,
Or to the tender vales go down
Whose brooks of love are singing.
There’s turn and rise, a grot beneath,
And flow-ers and ferns and heather —
Shared thoughts to make a verdant wreath
To bind our souls together!
I'll show her all the sweet delight
That love, when bid, will carry.
Far leagues have we to go ere night;
So why does Nancy tarry?
The blind is blank behind her pane....
Like death, the shadows chill me.
If Nancy should not come again,
What po-wer has day to thrill me.
The curtain moves! The blind goes up,
And Nancy’s face smiles after.
Sure, full of wine.is Nature’s cup,
Old earth is full of laughter!

Wandering Wind.
Where I cannot wander the wind sweeps by,
Gleaning dreams from the sea and sky.
It gathers musk from the jungle trails,
A breath of brine from the merchant sails,
The dry, hot whip of the desert air ;
For the wind has a key to Everywhere.
Tt climbs the spikes on an emperor’s gates;
And high on the rampart rocks it waits
In the yellow dawn by the walls of Ming
For the voice of Asia murmuring.
The feet of the wind have found a town
Where a thin green river ribbons down
Green river banks where willows ran,
And stealthy Arab and Turkoman
Could stain its shallows in raiders mood
With threaded rubies of Tartar blood.
Far on to the Kashmere vales it goes
To stir blood feud to a foam of rose.
Oh. wise was the wind that westward ran
From frowning turret and bartizan
To a garden snowed with the almond-bloom.
To the wmtcr jar and a darkened room!
There are jasmine scents in the shaken xold
Of a gown all ’broidered in jade and gold :
Through the guarded casement it knows she
sees
More things than blossom on mohur-trees.
The wind may go where I cannot go.
But the wind may change and come back;
and so,
Wearv with wandering, give to me
Dream fruits it found in the sky and sea!
QUEENSLAND.

THE DECENTRALISATION OF
CULTURE.
The issue between Sydney University Senate
and the Extensionists was sharply joined re-
cently when the Chancellor committed him-
self to the following statement: —
Whatever the ultimate decision is to be, it needs
careful thought whether it would not be better to
strip the University of Sydney of part of its State
endowments and to pension oif. the professors and
staff engaged by the Senate on the strength of this,
than to compel it to issue degrees to country students
on less effective preparation than is now afforded and
required.
The Senate has two main arguments against
decentralisation. The first suggests the story
of the apologetic housemaid’s irregular in-
fant :
Bathurst is connected with Sydney by a train
service of some six hours. Maitland and Goulburn
are still nearer. Farther away are Dubbo, Tamworth
and Armidale, each about 280 miles from Sydney,
and occupying 10 to 11 hours on the train journey.
Wagga is 320 miles away, Narrandera 360, Grafton
430, and Lismore nearly 90 miles farther away still.
Such journeys are “only little ones,” of
course, compared with those undertaken by
Australians who aspire to graduate at Euro-
pean or American universities. But they
are all too great for thousands who are tied
by family or financial obligations to the
country. It would be easy to find bright
young men whose work chains them to Picton
—barely an hour from Sydney—making it im-
possible for them to enjoy the privileges of
a University education. What the Exten-
sionists say is that for a large class, the
inevitable product of free and compulsory
education, a University course is a logical
and nationally desirable thing; that most
members of this class cannot go to the Uni-
versity, and that accordingly the University
should be brought to them. But the Senate
answers:—
The possession of a University degree, apart from
the training that lies behind it. is not so excellent a
thing in itself that country students should be put
off with any kind of a “second best,” it being better
to do without, as so many of their best prefer to do.
This second objection, which is really the
basis of the Senate’s hostility to the changes
advocated, pre-supposes (1) that a degree is
the chief aim of a University course, and
(2) that only a second-rate degree can be
got by a correspondence course.
As to the second of these conclusions,
the experiences of Queensland and the U.S.A.
disprove it. Students of human nature would,
however, be disposed to doubt the theory even
without the disproofs. Man does not value
what he gets easily, and similarly he prizes
what he lias to struggle for. The citizen
who is sufficiently eager for the higher cul-
ture to work for a city degree in the country
is rarely the stuff of which failures are made.
Where this type of student did prove a
failure academically—where it was found
that absence from Newtown or some other
factor had made it impossible for him to
assimilate the requisite amount of learning
—then the course of the University exami-
ners would be clear: they would have to fail
him. But who shall say, even then, that lie
would not have benefited by his effort, and
the community with him? H. A. L. Fisher,
the most scholarly President of the Board of
Education Britain has ever had, put it this
way to the boys at Sherborne School while in
office: —
What did we mean by an educated person? We
meant one who was alive to the best things—-one
who had preserved the faculty for admiration and
veneration. Is a man fond of a good book? Can lie
be moved by a beautiful poem or a passage of elo-
quence ? Has he intellectual curiosity and zest ?
Those are the tests.
The Greeks of Alexander’s day and before
well understood the principle, and they had
an effective means of getting results. They
made cultui’e competitive. A citizen of
Assyria or of Egypt was only an Assyrian or
an Egyptian—one of a mob. But a Greek
was something more than a Greek: he was
an Athenian, a Theban, a Thracian. As Van
Loon (“The Story of Mankind”) observes:
“The Greeks felt that their intelligent neigh-
bors were watching them....ln this hard
school they learned to excel. They created
new forms of government and new forms of
literature and new ideals in art which we
have never been able to surpass. They per-
formed these miracles in little villages that
covered less ground than four or five modern
city squares.” It is not too much to hope
that, given the chance, the same forms of
local patriotism may be stimulated in Aus-
tralia. The country plays the city periodi-
cally at tennis and polo and cricket. Is there
any reason why Orange, say, should not in
time become as proud of its local scholars as
it now is of its local League footballers?
There is no reason whatever —except that
the policy of Sydney University is to con-
centrate the whole of the State’s higher edu-
cation in Sydney, and that hundreds of
ambitious and able young backblockers can-
not afford to live in Sydney.
* * * *
The plain fact is that Sydney University
Senate and the decentralisers have two radi-
cally divergent concepts of how our educa-
tional system should develop—and it is the
humble country-dwellers who are on the side
of the angels. The Senators are admirable
characters to a man, but in many cases
neither environment and training nor age
renders them receptive to new ideas. To
them whatever is is best. Sydney University
is a blend of Oxford and Cambridge, institu-
tions of world-wide fame. Let it remain so;
let those who can afford to absorb culture
after the Oxford-Cambridge model be thank-
ful; and let those who cannot be equally
thankful that they are debarred from acquir-
ing culture on other (and hence inferior)
lines —such are the sentiments of the Senate.
But Oxford and Cambridge, for all their
splendid achievements, are the last examples
that any modern educationist would look to
for light and leading in view of the social
changes produced by popular education in the
last half-century. Despite post-war changes
the dilettante touch is still predominant
there. At least 50 per cent, of the under-
graduates still go up to round off sporting
and social careers begun at expensive public
schools—careers which may prove educative
for those destined to be county landowners
or London society men, but which have little re-
lation to the life-struggle in which most people
have to engage. The very shortage of money of
which the Sydney University authorities com-
plain so often is due partly to their deter-
mination to emulate the expensive habits of
the English homes of learning. Sydney pro-
fessors may not do themselves quite so well
as Christ Church dons; the gardens and
lawns at Newtown may not cost so much in
upkeep as those of Worcester and St. John’s;
plate and pictures may not represent idle
fortunes to the extent that they do in the
great Oxford and Cambridge colleges—but
things are getting on that way. And it is
the same with sport. Plenty of sport is an
excellent thing—for those with plenty of
leisure. It has bulked too large for genera-
tions in the lives of Oxford and Cambridge,
and it bulks too large in our copies of those
universities. It was by way of protest (1)
against the costliness of going into residence
for at least three years at the historic Eng-
lish universities, and (2) against the undue
importance which they attached to sport that
their rivals appeared. Most of them de-
veloped from local schools or teaching centres,
as would certainly happen in time here. Thus
Leeds University (constituted 1904) grew
out of Yorkshire College; Liverpool Univer-
sity (1903) from University College; Bir-
mingham University (1900) from Mason
University College; Bristol University(l9o9)
from University College, Bristol; Manchester
University (1903) from Owens College, and
so on. When London University was founded
88 years ago its speedy and ignominious col-
lapse was predicted by orthodox educationists
who argued that those who could not afford
the cultural best would only be prejudiced by
something demonstrably not so good. To-day
London outshines in many respects, not only
the universities of the U.K., but of the world;
and notably in the high general level of
its teaching staff and students —a matter
of earnestness, of putting work first and
sport, social gatherings and the rest of the
activities that are grouped under the headings
“Esprit dc corps' ’ and “Atmosphere” far in
the rear. The decentralisation of education
must come in Australia as it has in other
civilised countries. The pity is that those
who are opposing it cannot see that they
are fighting a useless battle, and that the
wisest step in the interests of their universi-
ties as well as in those of culture-hungry
folk up-country is to meet the situation in a
spirit of compromise.
THE BRITISH ELECTION AND
AUSTRALIA’S SHARE IN IT.
Rumor, that talkative ghost with no fixed
address, states persistently that Britain will
enjoy (or otherwise) another general election
within a few months —that either the Ram-
say Macdonald Government will go to the
country in search of a real majority, or the
King will refuse it a dissolution and it will
resign (though it will more probably hang
on), and Baldwin or his successor will
become Prime Minister as head of the big-
gest party, and, being promptly defeated, will
go to the country in search of a majority
instead. Certainly the present situation is
not tenable for any length of time. It is
tenable enough for the Ministry so long as
Asquith and Lloyd George, out of their
old-fashioned hatred of assisting local in-
dustry, are willing to keep it in office and
wages, but it is growing untenable for the
Government’s more advanced supporters, who
want it to find a following which will enable
it to do big things as well as draw big pay.
They even want it to find a following strong
enough to bring pressure on the House of
Peers when some of the big things get as
far as that body. It has massive schemes
for which to ask a definite mandate, includ-
ing increased old-age pensions, unemployment
relief all the year round, the levy on capital,
which still appears at intervals in the offing,
and the proposed building of 2,500,000 houses
at a cost of £1,376,000,000, all to be let at a
cheap and unpayable rental. It is a large
question whether the demand for a definite
“yes” or “no” on such matters will drive
the Liberals, who now keep the Macdonald
Ministry in office, to declare for putting it
out of office. It is difficult to imagine them
turning whole-hog Laborites and. adopting the
programme, and it is difficult to imagine them
finding any comfortable and commodious rail
to sit on, so that they can resume the work
of keeping the Government in while keeping
its most important devices out. An elec-
tion looks like a case of waking up the
somnolent dog, which was the rash and dis-
astrous act that Baldwin performed. But
voices from various places, notably the Clyde-
side, begin to shout to the Cabinet-in-a-tight-
place, “Get on or get out!” And the only
way to get on at any appreciable pace is to
gamble for a majority. At the worst it is
more dignified to be killed by an enemy in
front than by a friend from behind.
* * * *
The Macdonald combination began with
many troubles and they don't decrease.
The cost of unemployment insurance
grows: for 8-J months in 1923 .it
was more than for the whole of the previous
year, and the previous year was a record.
The value of coal exported falls, and the
price affects the wages, and the wages affect
the temper of the miners, who hold that a
Labor Government exists to solve little
problems like that offhand. If local prices
are raised, which could be done by a process
of strenuous interference, it might raise
wages, but it would also close factories,
which would be less able than ever to struggle
against competition on Freetrade principles,
and there would be more unemployed artisans
and miners. Freetrade began on the basis
that the Briton was the most skilled opera-
tive in the world, and that, with cheap raw
material, locally produced or imported free
of duty, the record coal supply and cheap
ships to carry his wares to the backward and
benighted foreigner, there was a briliant time
ahead. Now it is alleged that the Yankee
miner produces on an average 986 tons per
annum against the British miner’s 238 tons;
and that item and a few others like it knock
a large hole in the cheap-material idea, and
even raise doubts about the superior skill of
the British operative. The reasons in favor
of Freetrade were fairly good once; but as
they have all vanished, save the fact that
Britain remains the world’s greatest ship-
owner, the doctrine remains like a mediaeval
fortress, which would still be a very good
fortress if times hadn’t changed.
* * * *
It is up to Australia to prepare for the
British election whether the same be near or
far. Its first obvious bit of preparation is
to make an end at the earliest moment of the
British preferential tariff, though there is
nothing to prevent a renewal some other
day. Then, if the thing is done in time,
Ramsay Macdonald can go to the country
an absolutely Freetrade Government, with all
the advantages of its policy thick on its head
—it will not go as a non-tariff concern which
is bolstered in even a small degree by our
tariff. The British Government having de-
clared wholly against preference, it would be
common civility to take it at its word. The
Australian general tariff might even be in-
creased in places, so that we will have more
concessions to offer when concessions begin
to be talked off on a mutual basis. Should
other Dominions follow the same line, and
do so early, the next British election might
show a remarkable awakening of the Protec-
tionist spirit, for J. Bull’s material benefit.
Furthermore, if any power on earth or in
Heaven can awaken this country to the
futility of the foreign loan habit, the rigid
restriction of that would also be opportune,
even if it was considered necessary to stop
the export of gold in order to help the good
work along. There is a streak of absurdity
in the borrowing of great sums at a great
price, wlien the money only comes, if it
comes at all, in the form of goods. The
making of these goods may put a thin varnish
of prosperity on a few British industries,
but it is no business of ours to put even a
trace of varnish on anybody’s affairs. The
act savors of impertinence. In short, this
appears to be the time to do the Old Man a
good turn even against his will, and if it
proves ultimately to be a good turn for our-
selves so much the better.
THE PRESS AND DIVORCE.
The judgment of the House of Lords, dc
livered by Lord Birkenhead in Russeli
v. Russell, that the petitioner cannot give
evidence to prove the illegitimacy of the
respondent’s son, brings to an end a divorce
suit that, from the point of view of pub-
licity, must have broken all records. When,
with the passing of time, the infant takes
the title of Lord Ampthill, he will have
good reason to curse the impoverishment of
the family’s coffers as well as the taint that
the mother’s indiscretions has attached to
its name; and if he inherits any sensitive-
ness, he will agree with the New York
Nation that reputedly respectable English
newspapers shove disgusting details of
divorce cases under the noses of those least
desirous of devouring them or of feeding
their children upon them.
In this instance the Press probably justi-
fies its acts by saying that the whole affair
provides an excellent indictment of modern
civilisation. But the fact remains that the
Press has made it a martyrdom for people
of wealth or position to commence, or be
involved in, court proceedings—and, in par-
ticular, proceedings in divorce. It has be-
come a pillory of such gigantic dimensions
that many of refined natures prefer rather
to bear their burden of squalid misery or
marital infidelity than to expose themselves
to a gaping mob manifesting the diseased
appetite created for it by the newspapers.
The defences upon which the Press relies
in support of its contention that the out-
pouring of filthy details is in the best in-
terests of the community are that in camera
methods would lead to injustice, and that
the featuring of the incidents of divorce
acts as a deterrent. But the latter asser-
tion loses much of its force when it is per-
ceived that the newspapers urging it deck
such viciousness in as attractive a garb as
they can. Then it is suggested that the evil
of keeping secret what goes on in Courts
of Law is that arbitrary conduct on the part
of Judges and magistrates might result.
Those who advance this contention forget
that the law has adequate machinery for
reproving or punishing any of its officials
who overstep the bounds of justice. At the
same time, although divorces in France are
held in camera, the practice is not entirely
commendable. There is, however, a wide
difference between hearing a matrimonial
suit in private and hearing it in public, but
forbidding the publication of the evidence.
I agree with Mr. Justice Darling that the
presence of spectators removes a great incen-
tive to the commission of perjury; yet the
mere exclusion of the details from the gaze
of a large section of the public not interested
in them would not provide a similar tempta-
tion. During the recent ML. Sessions, a
Crown Prosecutor, on requesting Mr. Justice
Chapman to take in camera a case with dis-
tinctly unpleasant features, was met by the
statement that no such order would be made,
the spectators who remained doing so, accord-
ing to the Judge, in exceedingly bad taste.
Almost everyone having no direct interest
in the trial thereupon left the court. The
evidence was published, nevertheless.
The function of the Press is to purify and
not to pollute the streams of human life.
It. has not the slightest justification for
being, directly or indirectly, an instrument
for the dissemination of obscenity, for the
contamination of minds that would other-
wise be pure and undefiled. Some people, no
doubt, have an instinctive objection to shut-
ting out judicial matter from the view of
the country through the Press, on the ground
that such a remedy might open up the way
to abuses, graver than those existing at the
present time; but, if the public has con-
fidence in those who administer the law,
these fears would be groundless. Not, I
admit, that this confidence can always be
felt. Last year a deputation from the M.L.
churches waited on the Attorney-General
with a view, to his taking steps to prevent
the publication of details in divorce cases.
In a non-committal reply he assured the
members that the Press had not transgressed
the bounds of decency, and that it was a
powerful engine for political purposes. Yet,
12. months before, when an M.L. weekly
printed bona fide Siegfried Sassoon’s
“Stand-to: Good Friday Morning,” in which
the young Cambridge poet attempts to show
war as the filth and the pestilence that it
is, this self-same Attorney-General had no
hesitation in authorising the Crown to bring
a criminal action against the publisher and
the editor for blasphemous libel.
The defence, most resorted to by the Press
is that publicity in divorce acts as a deter-
rent. Now, anyone reading a newspaper re-
port to th© effect that James Jones was sen-
tenced to six months’ imprisonment for theft
can easily see that the publicity given to
such punishment acts, as a deterrent to per-
sons who have an inclination to commit
crimes of a similar nature; but what pre-
cisely the featuring of divorce sordidness is
supposed to deter it is difficult to imagine.
It is ludicrous , to suppose that the details
have any value in preventing marital infideli-
ties. Indeed, the course of our develop-
ment supports the opposite conclusion—that
the eagerness of the Press to give undue pro-
minence to adultery has led this diversion
from the realms of fashion into those of
respectability. As far back as 1908 St. Loe
Strachey told a Royal Commission that, in
his opinion, publicity was no deterrent.
But does it prevent the obtaining o£
decrees? Here the question goes deeper.
Granting to the Press its contention that the
publication of sordid histories of married
life does act as a deterrent against divorce,
and keeps men and women from bringing
their troubles before the Court, then I ask
what right the Press has to set itself up as
a Petronius Arbiter, and to demand that
where a marriage is a failure the parties
must brave its high gods before freeing them-
selves from the union? The harm is obvious,
especially when it is remembered that there
is virtually no escape from the newspaper,
and that with the. spread of education the
young are indiscriminate and omnivorous
readers of the Press. Instead of being
directed by it into channels from which
they intellectually benefit, they are more
often swept by this flood of corrupting matter
into sewers from which they vision marriage
as a thing of laughter, misery or shame. The
natural consequence of it all is that marriage
is brought well nigh into contempt by the
bruiting abroad of the wretched details of


domestic unhappiness and vice, and tile con-
centration of the pubhc mind on breaches of
the marriage contract. Under Our system a
mistaken marriage can hardly be remedied
without the disgrace of one or other of the
.'ties Matthew Arnold went so far as
o describe the Divorce Court as an insti-
tution which allows a man to get rid of his
wife or a woman of her husband, but which
mflkps them drag one another first througn.
a mire of unutterable filth for the public
edification. And John Galsworthy, him-
self an Inner Temple lawyer, struck the
same note in his "Country House :
Gregory pressed liis hands to his forehead.
"I’m trying to think,’’ he said, ‘‘what will be
the consequences to my ward of this divorce.”
“My iiiend listen to some plain speaking. Your
ward" ind her husband and George Pendycf. are
iust tne sort of people for whom our law of divorce
is framed. They’ve all three got courage, they’re
■ill reckless and obstinate, and —forgive me —thick-
skinned Their ease, if fought, will take a week of
hard swearing, a week of the public’s money and
time It will give admirable opportunities to eminent
counsel excellent reading to the general public, first-
rate sport all round. The papers will have a
regular carnival. 1 repeat, they are the very people
for whom our law of divorce is framed. There’s a
great deal to be said for publicity, but all the same
H puts a premium on insensibility, and causes a
Yas t amount of suffering to innocent people, t told
vou once before, to get a divorce, even if you
deserve it, you mustn’t be a sensitive person.
A MAOBILAND BARRISTER.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Let the Electors Decide.
Bruce’s arrangement with Page that members
now sitting behind the Government should
have the united support of Nationalists and
Cockies at the next House of Reps, election
was discussed in Melbourne last week by the
Farmers’ Federal organisation. About half
the delegates were Country-party politicians,
and the whole crowd were more or less un-
comfortable. On the one hand, they had
been warned that if they didn’t ratify the
agreement or treaty on the basis of uti pos-
sidetis the Government would crash, and
Page would cease to be Agrarian leader.
On the other hand, ratification might in-
volve such unpleasantnesses as the resigna-
tion of Stewart, Minister for Works and
leader of those hostile to the pact, a party
split in Victoria and perhaps three other
States, and considerable secessions to Labor.
General relief was felt when someone pointed
out that the National Federation hadn’t made
its views known, and that it would be bad
policy for the Cockies to commit themselves
to an alliance that the other people might
reject. So the half-Priministers were com-
plimented in a politely-worded resolution
(“This Conference commends the work of the
Bruce-Page Government, and endorses its
programme of legislation”), and it was
arranged to renew the discussion about the
middle of July, the Nationalist organisation
having agreed to deliberate at the same time.
The postponement has been described as a
tactical success for the ratificationists, but it
is really more advantageous to the malcontents
in both parties, since it will give them time
to mobilise the arguments against acceptance
of the pact in its present form. Some of
these arguments are subjoined:—
The present understanding has worked tolerably
well. Since it was arrived at, 17 months ago, the
Government has never once been endangered, or even
embarrassed by unruly followers: and that couldn’t
have been written of Hughes even when he had a
majority. The two parties have usefully co-operated
without sacrifice of entities or principles; the Ad-
ministration, with aIT its faults, is a long way better
than the one it succeeded. But if the pact is
approved there will be sacrifice of principles (the
Cockies, for instance, will have to accept pre-4
selection, which they have hitherto denounced), and
the stronger party will inevitably absorb the weaker.
There will be a coalition in fact if not in name,
and in normal times Australia doesn’t love coalitions.
Deakin’s Protectionists coalesced with Cook’s Freef
traders in 1909 ; the resultant Liberals were heavily
defeated at the 1910 election. The Labor conscrip-
tionists coalesced with the Liberals in 1917, and.J
thanks to the war feeling and the imbecile pacifism
of the Labor Opposition, two-thirds of the Represen-T
tatives and all the Senators elected that year were'
Nationalists. In 1922, however, only 28 of the 75
Representatives were Nationalists. Once the war-
feeling had vanished the general dislike of coalitions
reasserted itself.
The pact would introduce an odious form of pre-
selection. Pre-selection by party ballot is bad
enough, but pre-selection by party leaders who de-
liberately confine their choice to sitting members —
end this 18 months before the event —would be an
intolerable invasion of popular rights. Intolerable
also is the implied claim that the growth of the
parties associated in the Government should be sub-
ject to private arrangements of Bruce and Page,
instead of being determined absolutely by public
opinion expressed in the polling-booth.
In 1922 Massy Greene, Wise, Chanter and Bell,
Nationalist members, were beaten by Country-party
men; McWilliams, Fleming and Jowett, Cocky
members, were beaten by Nationalists. Greene had
been Minister for Defence and M.H.R. for Richmond
(N.S.W.) since 1910, and Wise Postmaster-General
and M.H.R. for Gippsland since 1906; Chanter was
an original member of the Commonwealth Parliament,
McWilliams a product of the second (1903) vintage
and sometime leader of the Country party, and
Fleming deputy-leader of the Cockies and an M.H.R.
for 10 years—like Bell, also, he had served in the
war. Each of the seven polled well (Bell, indeed,
scored 482 more primary votes than his conqueror),
and, like the others, is clearly entitled to ask his
former constituents for another chance, especially as
only 43.82 of them voted in McWilliams’s electorate,
46.52 in Bell’s, 52.3 in Fleming’s, 55.93 in
Greene’s, 58.29 in Chanter’s, 56.07 in Wise’s, and
63.34 in Jowett’s. But if the pact goes through not
one of these men will get a party nomination for
his old seat. He will have to stand aside or run as
an Independent. The rank ingratitude and injustice
of this are so manifest that no defence has even been
attempted.
There are only 14 Cocky seats in the House of
Reps., and at least six are independent of any pact.
In case of an election, the party might contest 22
seats —not so many perhaps; certainly not more.
Although Hughes and Page were at daggers drawn in
1922 each group got most of the other’s preferences,
only one seat (Wannon) being lost to a Labor man
because the retiring member (Rodgers, the Minister
for Trade and Customs) didn’t get enough of them.
And Rodgers’s defeat was due less to ill-feeling be-
tween Cockies and Nationalists, as such, than to
local unpopularity he had earned for some reason or
other and the general aversion to Hughes.
Nationalists like Chapman are congenial to the
Cockies; Cockies like Hunter are congenial to the
Nationalists. The number of Ministerial seats that
both groups will want to contest may be reduced to
a dozen at the outside. If these sbats could be
won with an “open go” iu 1922 they can be won
with an “open go” in 1925, seeing that the parties
then at war one with the other are now’ associated
in a Government under a leader congenial to both.
Any other arrangement would be an intrigue.
It is not in the constituencies affected by the pact
that the great danger lies. The Government may be
rudely defeated even if it holds all the seats affected
by the pact. Its fate will probably be decided in
a dozen or more constituencies, urban for the most
part, where there was no Country party opposition
in 1922 nor is there any likelihood of it in 1925 —
such constituencies as Corio, Ballarat, Batman and
Fawkner in Victoria; Lang and Reid in N. S. Wales;
Brisbane, Oxley and Herbert in Queensland; Perth and
Fremantle in W.A.; Denison in Tasmania; and
Boothby in South Australia. In Corio the Nationalise
majority was only 400; in Fawkner 938; in Herbert
1137 ; in Brisbane 1234 : in Boothby 1861; in Oxley
2406. Nearly all the seats mentioned have been
previously held by the Labor party.
In the present temper of the Commonwealth
Labor party a Charlton Government would
be a calamity. But a Charlton Government
will not be kept out by restricting the
people’s choice of representatives and Stifling
the normal growth of parties —by an arrange-
ment, in short, which will be rejected by
many Nationalist and Country party elec-
tors who think more of principle than of ex-
pediency, and set a higher value on their
rights and privileges than on the convenience
of any Government.
The Boer Republican Comes Again.
The Smuts Government has fallen in South
Africa (so great was the fall that the
Prime Minister himself was defeated), and
has been succeeded by an Administration
no more friendly to the British connection
than the one in Dublin. Barring accidents,
the new crowd will be in office for five years,
mid lots of things may happen in five years.
In an Assembly of 130 members it will be
supported by 59 Afrikander Republicans and
IS Laborites permeated with Red. All will
have to take an oath or affirmation of alle-
giance, and there is an understanding that
the separation question will not be raised
during the lifetime of the impending Parlia-
ment ; but the understanding was made before
anyone dreamed that the pro-Britisli party
would be beaten so badly, and there is an
obvious possibility of its being reviewed in
the light of that event. A section of Boer
irreconcilables has already denounced it. No
doubt thousands of those who voted for the
victorious allies have no sympathy with Re-
publicanism of either Dopper or Russian
brand. Many were unquestionably moved
by the feeling that the Government had been
too long in office, and that it was time to
give the other fellow a show. People in-
evitably grow weary of an Administration
that has been running things for 14 years.
Smuts, it was held, moreover, was too thick
with the Rand capitalists; too severe on the
Rand strikers; too fond of rushing away
periodically to settle the affairs of Europe
while neglecting those of South Africa. These
convictions were strong among wage-earners
who desire neither a Soviet Republic nor one
dominated bv back-veldt Boers. Still, there
is no disputing the fact that Hertzog and
his Nationalists (their aims are very dif-
ferent from those of the Australian party
sporting that label) owe much of their suc-
cess to the growth of Republican sentiment.
In i 915 there were, only 27 Nationalist mem-
bers ; by 1921 the number had grown to 47 ;
now they need only seven more seats to get
a clear majority. In the same period the
Coalition party supporting Smuts has shrunk
trom 94 to 52. The Orange Free State, as
always, was solid for Republicanism; Natal
and the British parts of the Cape mostly
adhered to the Government; but Labor
gained solidly on the Rand and the National-
ists in Transvaal farming electorates, such as
Heidelburg, Ventersdorp, Potchefstroom and
liustenburg. This ominously suggests that
Boers who once supported Botha and Smuts
and the Dominion status for which they stood
have gone over to Republicanism.

The “Pony” Curse in N. S. Wales.
The N. S. Wales Committee of Inquiry into
pony racing concluded its investigations last
week. It was unfortunate that the members
should have been Parliamentarians with in-
fluential constituents holding large financial
interests in the clubs under review, and sug-
gestive that the clubs should have thought
fit to brief one of the strongest members of
the junior bar to defend them. However,
the disreputable truth leaked out, and its
effect on the Committee was revealed by a
question put to the last witness, the chairman
of the A.J.C.: —
Mr. O’Hallorak : If the A.J.C. is requested to
supervise proprietary pony racing in the same way
that it does registered proprietary racing, will the
A.J.C. Committee take over that added responsibility ?
Mr. Curtis (for the clubs) : Does that mean
appeals ?
Mr. O’Hali.oran : Everything. The whole super-
vision and control of pony racing.
Mr. Colin Stephen’s answer was: “We
would have to consider it. I think we would
be ill advised to turn down such an applica-
tion, as it would be in the public interest.”
His idea was subsequently shown to be that
the present situation can be met by govern-
ing the pony courses under the constitution
which has proved fairly satisfactory in regis-
tered racing. But here The Bulletin differs
from him. It is not possible to mend a
sewer with gum, and it is similarly hope-
less to expect to clean up pony racing with
any instrument less drastic than an auto-
cracy. The model —at any rate for the first
years of the venture —should be the English
Jockey Club. This body investigates and
acts without regard to the accepted conven-
tions of British justice. A classic illustra-
tion of its methods was the case of Tod
Sloan, who at the height of his career as a
jockey went out for life for betting. There
■was no suggestion that he had backed any
mounts but his own, but the Jockey Club
was satisfied that his departure would im-
prove the aroma of the turf, and from that
decision there was no appeal. An intolerable
situation in a normal industry, of course;
but the universal tendency of the so-called
Sport of Kings is to develop into a Sport of
Criminals unless ruled with an iron hand.
The N. S. Wales pony courses have become
what they are—haunts of thieves; places
where the professional “gun” goes in quest
of the flash “mug” and is seldom dis-
appointed; convincing-grounds on which
ramps and “jokes” for the fleecing of a fool-
public are so common that the sporting
intelligentsia guffaw at talk of an honestly-
run race —because they have been free for
years from the only kind of control that
habitual malefactors understand. It would
be safe to give men like Mr. Stephen powers
that have been exercised in England for a
century by men like Lord Derby. They
could always be trusted to act in what
they believed —whether mistakenly or other-
wise—to be the best interests of the public
and of racing. The only satisfactory alter-
native is to abolish this outlet for criminality
altogether. The cult of the under-sized horse
is confined almost entirely to Australia, and
large parts even of this nation of starting-
price punters manage to do without it—for
example, S. Australia. In either event a
Government that had the nerve to act in
defiance of the massed displeasure of the
State’s racecourse thugs, urgers, whisperers
and other shoddy rogues would rally a sur-
prising number of decent supporters to its
banner.
+
The Cadgers.
Tasmania receives little sympathy and a
great deal of cold shoulder from its richer
and more arrogant neighbors in its financial
troubles. In fact, one paper lately suggested
that “a State so dependent on the National
Government for its financial integrity” should
be annexed to some other State, or made into
a Federal territory, and run as the North is.
Yet all the little island asks is a grant of
£85,000 per annum till it turns the corner,
and that the Commonwealth should cease to
tax its little'lottery, and leave it that scrap
of revenue. Tasmania has had poor luck
among the loaves and fishes. It certainly
got a small allowance-in-aid from the Com-
monwealth; but Westralia, wallowing in
gold, did as much, and in addition secured
the right to collect a separate tariff of its
own for a term of years. Tasmania wasn’t
supplied with an exceedingly costly railway
at the common charge, as Westralia was. It
hadn’t the luck to sell a money-losing line
to the National Government, as S. Australia
did. It didn’t even insist on the Federal
capital being deposited inside its territory,
whatever that concession may be worth. And
in asking for Federal assistance Tasmania
has still plenty of company. N. S. Wales is
negotiating hard for an aid of a million or
more in the shape of a Federal grant for
building a railway over a purely local water-
way, the Clarence, the plea being that it is
a “national work.” Queensland and N. S.
Wales are jointly negotiating for the con-
struction, at the general charge,; of a rail-
way “link” which will provide a uniform
gauge from Albury to Brisbane. A Federal
line between Port Augusta and Hay or some
other spot in N. S. Wales, to un-
broken communication from Kalgoorlie to
Sydney, is under consideration, and is ex-
pected to eventuate. A track has been worn
on the official carpet by the feet of deputa-
tions with schemes for a Federal railway to
open up the northern parts of Westralia, and
another track by the hoofs of other deputa-
tions advocating a “national” line at the
general charge from Bourke (N.S.W.),
through Western Queensland, to some port
on the coast of Northern Australia. S. Aus-
tralia is, of. course, insistent in its demand
for the construction of the South-to-North
line, but as that has been paid for in advance
by a land-grant it isn’t so much a cadge as
an unpromising attempt to collect a debt.
Amid all this rush Tasmania is at a dis-
advantage, for being quite isolated it has no
work of its own that it can charge up to
the Commonwealth as “national.” It is in a
perfectly good position to subscribe toward
its neighbors’ jobs, and in a hopelessly bad
one for getting through with an occasional
job of its own. Its standing troubles in-
clude a poorly-paying railway system, which
has to compete with sea-carriage to an ex-
tent unknown on the mainland; poor land
revenue (about Bs. Id. per head per annum
as compared with a general average of about
165.), due to the fact that it is a fairly well-
peopled country, and too much of the land is
only scenery; and a comparatively poor re-
venue from income-tax and the like, because
when a manufacturer wants to start business
inside the Commonwealth’s tariff wall he
naturally, nine times out of ten, sets himself
up alongside the big populations. Tasmania
knew perfectly well that Federation w r as
going to hit it hard; its representatives said
so again and again in the Federal Conven-
tion. But it was a good enough Australian
to recognise that, with its magnificent harbor
of Hobart, its inclusion in the Australian
Commonwealth was imperatively necessary.
Of recent years it has been struggling to over-
come the handicap of its smallness and its
insularity by developing its water-power.
Unfortunately it struck dear money;
and that proved too much of a bur-
den in the long construction period. Still
its prospects are bright; and it deserves
something more than the sneer which is too
often thrown at it. If it is a cadger it is
only one of a crowd. And while some of
the others are healthy, lusty mendicants, it
at least can claim that it received wounds in
the cause of Australian Federation.

The Live Heart of Australia.
The member without a vote from the North-
ern Territory earned several years’ salary
in advance when he spoke on the latest
scheme for the disposal of Northern Terri-
tory lands. It recently occurred to some
of the Crown tenants who occupy vast
areas in the Territory, and pay next
to nothing for them, and do little good
with them, that it would be good business
to secure new leases before the old ones ex-
pired, and a Government which neither
knew nor cared proceeded to oblige them.
It set to work to lock up a great province
for another lifetime, as casually as it would
have locked up a dog or a drunk; and the
monstrous job was about to put itself
through when Darwin came on the scene.
Apparently no one had looked at the ordi-
nance, and one member, who shouted “Who
on earth reads the Government Gazette?”
seemed quite proud of neglecting the work
he was paid to do. The case put forward
by Nelson, of the Territory, and since en-
dorsed by correspondents at Darwin, was
illuminating. This country really possesses
some fine robust desert; but there is also
much fine country, fit to carry one to three
slieep per acre,' and the simple and sufficient
reason why there aren’t sheep is the lack
of a railway to carry away the wool and
bring in supplies. When the w’ant of roads
is added, and the means of conveyance for
wool, fencing wire, machinery and all man-
ner of light and heavy goods is restricted, in
many cases, to a slow and humpy animal of
foreign descent which has to be unloaded
every night and loaded every morning, the
difficulties in the way of doing a large busi-
ness are obvious. There is also much good
cattle country in the big Federal Possession,
though the best of that, too, is not on the
muggy coastal strip; and there are minerals
waiting for heavy appliances, which in their
turn are waiting for cheap freight. The
Territory is miserably under-stocked, and the
typical squatter could keep his animals on a
fraction of his principality; but it costs
next to nothing, it gives a sense of posses-
sion, and there is some remote chance c£
collecting compensation some day for get-
ting out of the way of progress. So strong
is the sense of possession that, a storekeeper
in one of the overland settlements was re-
fused permission by the local duke to fence
in one square mile of the unused immensity
that his animals might not stray; yet a
storekeeper is a necessary being, and might,
expect encouragement. The latest available
Federal figures gave the number of cattle,
sheep, horses and pigs on 523.620 square
miles of country (97,800 of them in the tem-
perate zone) as 614,000, while Tasmania,
one-twentieth the size, possessed 1,860,000.
Agriculture was set down as practically nil,
population as going, trade as practically
gone. Yet, until a local member came from
the previously disfranchised land to stir
up the muddy pool of torpidity, the only
inspiration on hand was to stolidly pursue
the three old ways which are: —
(1) To leave the big squatter in possession for an-
other generation, if people who own this mere hand-
ful of animals are squatters.
(2) To leave the railway to which the Common-
wealth is pledged still at. a dead-end in a dry and
unsatisfactory section of S.A., though there is a Land
of very respectable Promise ahead, including a cool,
elevated region with real rain and things that look
like rivers.
(3) To still hope that settlers will come, per the
ships that have practically left off coming owing to
the Navigation Act and other circumstances, by the
long sea trails, and drop ashore at the hottest and
most discouraging end of the Possession. From there
they can go inland by the fortnightly train, and see
if some squatter has a square mile of land that he;
doesn’t want.
The New States Commission.
The labors of the New States Commission in
the northern parts of N. S. Wales tend to
look almost ridiculous through the business
being commenced at the end, while the be-
ginning and middle are ignored. The Com-
mission can get more opinions than it has
time or space for in favor of subdivision.
But though public sentiment is plain enough,
there is an air of unreality about the whole
proceedings, as if public sentiment, even if
almost unanimous, didn’t count for much.
The difficulty is that no one has ever contrived
to get the State Legislature to answer three
preliminary questions to some such effect as
this: —
1. If an area which is large and populous enough
to set up for itself shows signs of a desire to set
up for itself, has it the moral right to a chance
to definitely express that desire? (The fact that
there are signs of a desire for separation was
admitted by the appointment of the present Com-
mission ; but apparently a Commission was preferred
to a referendum because it was expected to take
longer, cost more and supply absolute proof of
nothing.)
2. If the definite expression of a large area like
the north-east of N. S. Wales is in favor of a new
State, should this fact count for anything? Or
should the people be told that, unless the congested
majority in Cumberland County consents, there is
nothing doing, and that as the congestion round the
capital grows more overwhelming, there will never
be anything doing in a lawful way?
3. In short, is the only way for a local majority
to really get any consideration by bloodshed and
arson ? (British statesmanship told Ireland for a
long time that there was no other way, and it is re-
markable how pig-headedness repeats itself.)
If any party was sufficiently strong and per-
sistent to extract from the N. S. Wales
Parliament categorical replies to these
queries, it might clear up a lot of doubt as
to the best course to pursue, and about the
value of the present intensely dubious Com-
mission. No doubt the obstacles in the way
of securing categorical replies are great.
Three elusive answers are always available
when trouble is looming and big events are
afoot: (1) That as soon as the speaker is
satisfied that there is any real demand he
will, as a sound democrat, lend a willing
ear. (The difficulty is to get him to let the
popular demand express itself, expressions
at a general election being always described
as too indefinite.) (2) That he hasn’t made
up his own mind, but is concentrating on
the problem. (This has been Hughes’s con-
dition about most matters of heavy respon-
sibility all his political life.) (3) That
the plaintiffs may really be better off as
they are, only they don’t know it. (This
craving of heavy-minded infallibles to do good
to their fellow’s, even if their fellow's don’t
want that kind of good done to them at any
price, has kept people inside empires and
kingdoms and churches that they heartily
disliked all through history. In fact, people
used to be formally and categorically damned
for their own good; and unfortunately they
never came back to tell the result.)

More Stefansson.
Arthur Ryall also remembers: —
Dr. Stefansson has a large capacity for finding
the familiar. According to a Sydney paper he
“discovered a blue-eyed type of Eskimo.’’ When
the late C. D. Melvill returned from an expedition
W'hich had wintered on the north shore of Great Beat-
Lake he came in contact with some of this tribe
in the region of the Coppermine River. On his
return to Edmonton, Alberta, he was interviewed on >
the subject, and his interview was published in the
Edmonton Journal and Edmonton Bulletin. Later
on, before my battalien left Winnipeg, I met the
late Roderick Macfarlane, a man who had spent
his life in the service of the Hudson Bay Co., most
of it at Fort Anderson on the Anderson River. He
told me that blue-eyed or blonde Eskimos, of tin-
type which Melvill had met, were frequent
visitors at the Fort, and that mention of

them eouM be found in the journals kept
by Hudson Bay factors, at Fort Anderson, and
previously at Fort Norman, as far back as 1840. These
journals, by the way, have been kept for over a
century. Some years ago they were collected from
the different forts and stored in a library in London,
where no doubt: they are available for the informa-
tion of explorers and other discoverers. Macfarlane-
told me that both he and Anderson wore of
opinion that the blue-eyed Eskimo originally came
by way ot Greenland from the north coast of Scan-
dinavia ; they were quite different from the inland
tribes. Again, this Dr. Stefansson declared in
Sydney that he was unaware of the Great War
while it was in progress, as he was away from
1913 to 191 S. Still, he seems to have been in
some soil of communication with Fort Norman
(Herschell Island) and Dawson City (Yukon) ; and
news of the war reached Dawson City by telegraph
directly war was declared (a machine-gun con-
tingent left there very soon after), while the news
was at Herschell Island about Christmas, 1914.
Incidentally, if Stefansson really has knowledge of
14,000 words of the Eskimo language, it would he
of great value to the missions if he would commit the
same to paper. Bishop Brennan had an Eskimo family
at his headquarters at Fort Resolution, and two
men of learning were trying to get some smattering
of their language to build upon, so as to establish
a mission at the site of old Fort Confidence in
the heart of the Eskimo country. In 1919 Bishop
Brennan told me no white man had any conception
of the language.

The Militarism of the Proletariat.
Sydney Worker, once a supporter of the
Australian defence movement but now an
organ of local pacifism, objected the other
day to the dictum of Vic. Chief Justice
Irvine that “when the King’s Government
is at war we are all at war” :
The workers of Australia should make it perfectly
clear that they will take no part in another organised
murder. Nothing can be plainer than the fact that
if the pullers of the strings succeed in their hideous
object there will be a huge attempt to stampede
young Australians into the shambles. Let us prepare
lor any possible capitalists’ war by determining that
Australia shall remain at peace.
This Pharisaical assumption that all the
militaristic sinners are on the other side is
characteristic of class and sectarian publica-
tions. The greatest army in the world to-
day—an army seven times greater than that
of capitalistic Britain —is controlled by the
Soviet Government of Russia. Germany,
another European nation which has achieved
government by proletarians for proletarians,
shows no signs of regeneration along paci-
fist lines. The strongest individual force in
the Fascist organisations of North and Cen-
tral Germany is the National Socialist party,
and in Silesia 80 per cent, of the Fascisti
are miners. These are no doubt among the
manifestations which caused the idealistic
and formerly optimistic Lord Cecil to re-
mark during a lecture in Amsterdam a few
days back:—
Germany’s admission to the League of Nations is
doubtful. I am of opinion Germany will keep her
hahds free in order to neutralise her “grievances” bv
means of a new war.
Australia’s immediate menace, however, is
not from debilitated Europe, which has no
grievance against us, but from vigorous Asia,
which has several grievances. If proletariat
Germany is prepared to go to war with
republican France for revenge, and if Com-
munist Russia is prepared to commit “organ-
ised murder” in Roumania for territory, why
should au Asiatic Power, which is frankly
imperialistic, nationalist and militarist, be
any more forbearing as regards the Common-
wealth? Happily for us there is an answer
-—to amend the Vic. Chief Justice’s platitude,
“Because when we are at war the King’s
Government is at war.” But for that fact
our position w r ould be most perilous, seeing
that the Commonwealth is virtually unarmed
at sea and on land, and that Federal Labor,
which seems to have a sporting chance of
reaching the Treasury benches at next elec-
tions, has announced its intention of per-
petuating that state of affairs. In the cir-
cumstances, the least w r e can do is to avoid
being offensive to our protectors. If we want
to strike a fine moral attitude directed
against string-pullers who wish to “stam-
pede young Australians into the shambles,”
there is but one way to do it safely and self-
respectingly—by becoming independent of
Britain financially, industrially and, above
all, navally.

A Word with a Bore.
With his incurable habit of making a noise
like a melancholy turnip in the distance,
N. S. Wales Opposition-leader Lang fled
into print when a cable came through to the
effect that the underwriters were holding,
for the time being, 85 per cent, of the Ma
State’s 5 per cent. £10,000,000 loan. Some
of his language was almost hobnailed in its
earnestness
The complete failure of the State Treasurer’s latest
London loan is a fitting climax to the Fuller
Ministry’s record of bungling in public finance.... A
comparison between the success of the Queensland
loan and the absolute failure of the N.S.W. loan
shows quite clearly that the only way to restore
the credit of the State is to immediately place a
Labor Government in charge of the affairs of the
State. If the Fuller Ministry is allowed to con-
tinue on its ruinous course even the underwriters
will refuse to have anything to do with it.
TV hat humbugs these politicians are! The
Fuller Government got the whole
£10,000,000 it asked for, and it got the money
at what is now regarded as moderate interest.;
and Fuller didn’t have to go to London in
person as Theodore did, and hang round
there for weeks, and finally make a promise
of fair dealing to the State tenants in future
before he got the money he wanted, and even
then pay an extra -A per cent, and allow a
discount. Theodore’s mission came off, like
that of the other pilgrim who went to Can-
ossa ; but going to Canossa is always a trifle
absurd, and it is a cold place for penitents
in hair shirts. Speaking of complete failures,
there have been tw T o in recent days. One
was Theodore’s, when he paid his first visit
to London, and asked for £9,000,000, and
came away raving, without a cent. Another
was that of Lang’s own chief, Premier
Storey. Just when Attorney-General
Fihelly had made rather a fiasco with his
Profiteering Bill, and Treasurer Lang had
outlined his scheme whereby the Government
could take almost anybody’s estate, and pay
for it with long-dated and low-interest-bear-
ing paper, and start selling it for cash,
Storey went to London to look earnestly at
the loan market. There was a great deal
of secrecy about the proceedings, but it was
THE BAD GIRL OF THE FAMILY.
“Melbourne is still upholding its unenviable reputation for serious crime and lawlessness.”
MR. JUSTICE AUSTRALIA: “You have a shocking record — you're always coming here. I
don’t know what to do with you, I’m sure.”
THE INCORRIGIBLE: “’Ow about givin ’ me a season-ticket, yer Honor?”
attested most solemnly that John had been
received with open arms, and arrangements
had been made for all the money that the
human soul could wish for. Yet the alleged
money didn’t turn up. But Lang’s wooden-
headed Land Bill was dropped, possibly on
the demand of the big financiers of England,
who would object as much to be looted by
him as by Theodore. And Lang put a loan
on the local market, and when a couple of
the Government’s own departments sub-
scribed their bit the Treasurer declared him-
self profoundly gratified at the vigor of the
public response!

“Hooshta” : As a lover of a “fair go” I dis-
agreed with “Solomon Malaprop’s” criti-
cism of Stefansson. Now, after reading that
Dr. Stefansson’s examination of our “in-
nards” is to be made between Oodnadatta
and the Macdonnell Ranges, with the assist-
ance of a Lizzie, I am crossing right over to
“Solomon’s” corner. The discoveries to be
made in this “stupendous undertaking” are,
in accordance with the Arctic traveller’s in-
tention. to be embodied in “A Geography of
Australia by Viliijalmur Stefansson,”
which learned work is to be used as a text-
book in the schools of Canada. The Federal
Government is paying the expenses of the
joy-ride, which will include Keith Ward,
Government Geologist of South Aus., who
had a similar ride about six months ago,
also at Statd expense. Ye gods! Has not
the Federal Government sufficiently misre-
presented the geography of Australia per
medium of its Australia House staff without
finding it necessary to frank a well-paid lec-
turer on Arctic affairs over a well-beaten
road in order that he may make “confusion
worse confounded”? If in three weeks be-
tween Oodnadatta and Alice Springs, taking
in Arltunga and Hermansburg, sufficient
material can be amassed to write a new
geography of Australia, why not let Mr.
Ward write it and save expense? He has
already been over the ground and picked a
site for a well. Better still, relegate the
job to Mullah Dad. He has been over the
course a hundred times, and knows every
waterway within hundreds of miles of the
road. And Mullah Dad is nobody’s fool
either.

Richard Arthur, M.L.A., writes:—
Six years ago, when I was a commissioner to report
on the V.D. question, I urged the directors of the
Sydney Hospital to close the V.D. clinic there on
account of the scandalous accommodation. This
would have thrown the responsibility, on the Govern-
ment, as I intended it should. Neither at the Syd-
ney nor Prince Alfred nor at any country hospital
has any additional accommodation been provided
since the passing of the V.D. Act. It makes one
despair at the blindness and folly of those in
authority. Many years ago I took an unfortunate
boy of 15 years, who was under my care at the Syd-
ney Hospital, into Parliament House and placed him
in the midst of a number of members. The poor
lad was of the stature of a boy of ten years; he was
totally and permanently deaf; he was almost blind,
but some of his sight might be recovered; his nose
was flat on his face, and the interior of the nose was
simply a mass of decayed and horribly offensive
smelling bone. 1 said: “There is an innocent victim
of hereditary syphilis—there is a problem you have
to face.” It hasn’t been faced yet.
7 — * — :
“Solomon Malaprop” : There is too much
looseness about the expression the “interior
of Australia.” Some people seem to think
that the centre of desert Australia is Alice
Springs—a townlet nearly 2000 ft. above sea-
level, backed by “a huge red wall of granite
400 miles east and west,” and 4000 ft. high
in places. Such a centre didn’t require much
discovery, especially as even the unimagina-
tive statistical man estimated the length of
the principal river thereabouts at 1000 miles
■ —nothing navigable and not quite permanent,
yet wet and capable of being dammed. It
is reported now that Stefansson is going
to Alice Springs. It is what I might expect
him to do; but he should be told beforehand
that Alice Springs is no more “the desert of
Australia” than Sydney’s Hyde Park is.

A Sydney clergyman, grieved at press sug-
gestions that the U.S.A. Government is as
militaristic as any, wrote to S. M. llebai.d
last week in this naif strain:—
It may be of interest to your many readers to
know that Senator T. Wilbur has recently been
elected a deacon of the first Congregational Church,
Washington, in which church President Cooluige a
few months ago became a “member,” by public
profession of Christian faith. Ought not the public
acts of these officials to be judged in the light of
their private religious profession?
It is not necessary to go back farther than
the war which ended f>4 years ago to dis-
cover that public professions of Christianity
have no relation whatever to pacifism. In
all the belligerent countries the Churches
were vigorous recruiting agencies. The Aus-
trian clergy, through their newspaper the
Vienna Reiciipost, had a deal to do with
starting the tragedy, and the German Centre
(or Clerical) party advocated frightfulness to
the last. In England the leaders of the
Established Church preached what they
called “a righteous hardening of hearts
against the enemy,” and Father Vaughan
adopted the amiable slogan, “Keep on kill-
ing Germans.” A clergyman sat on each
tribunal formed to deal with Britain’s con-
scientious objectors, and, according to the
testimony of the eminent Quaker who re-
cently published a history of the movement,
the clerics were as ruthless as the lay mem-
bers, and more so. No divine of the Vic-
torian era preached brotherly love more
eloquently than Charles Kingsley during
the peace years, yet, when the Crimean War
came, he proclaimed it t,o be “a just war
against tyrants and oppressors.” “Be sure
of it,” he concluded, “for the Bible tells you
so.” And just here may be found the catch
in all religions regarded as a pacifist influ-
ence. Almost all ecclesiastics, Christian or
otherwise, argue from the premise that the
Lord of Hosts is on the side of their nation,
and the conclusion is naturally drawn that
any methods are justified that promise a win.

“C.H.R.” on British and German gunnery:
“X.N.0.” (B. 19/6/’24), dealing with comparisons
between British and American naval gunnery, inspires
another comparison which shows that a useful medio-
crity is almost certain in the actual test to be more
effective than devastating efficiency. German range
finders w r ere accurate to a degree, being constructed
on a stereoscopic principle as against the direct-
angle measuring method used in the British Barr and
Stroud instrument. This had something to do with
the accuracy of their shooting, but the terrible
efficiency of their calibration defeated the advantage
gained by accurate range-finding. If a British salvo
missed by an average distance of 500 yards, the
fact that the shot would be spread over a distance
of 200 yards would mean that an “up-corfection” of
400 yards would bring the furthest gun on to the
target, though the mean range of all guns would be
100 yards wrong. An enemy ship altering course
when hit would also have to travel 200 yards directly
towards or away from his assailant before getting out
of the danger zone. On the other hand a German
salvo missing by 500 yards would, on account of
the almost complete absence of “spread,” have to
be corrected by the exact amount of error—-neither
more nor less —in order to hit. If the exact correc-
tion were rightly guessed, probably every German
shell would hit; but this would only happen now
and again, and more by luck than anything else.
The result might be that a British ship would be hit,
by four or five shells all at the same time, say
every 20 minutes, whereas the German ship would be
hit by one or two shells, but at more frequent inter-
vals. The material damage might be much the same,
but the moral effect of being hit by something fairly
frequently is much worse than the moral effect of
being hit by a whole bunch of stuff at long inter-
vals. The actual result was that the Germans might
get one good salvo home—and then go to pieces
under the less violent but more frequent bursts of
the British shell. British naval officers realised that
gunnery at sea is not, and never can be, an exact
science, and that the best results would be obtained
by not aiming at anything better than good average
results. The Germans tried to make it an exact
science and were beaten because they forgot the
law of averages. Jutland was a case in point.
Though the Germans actually sank more of our ships
than we did of theirs, they became a disintegrated
rabble, and next time their Fleet was ordered to
sea the ships’ companies refused to go.
A point which the uproar in Italy over
the Matteotti crime establishes is that mis-
timing is as fatal to success in high politics
as in tennis or the prize-ring. A year ago
the Fascist leaders who dealt so vigorously
with the socialist deputy would have been
hailed as patriots and heroes: whereas
to-day they are outcasts who will be lucky
if they escape with their lives. They have
overlooked the iron law of periodicity. This
is more unforgivable since a glance at
Russia would have shown them what was
presently inevitable in Italy. In Russia
active pacifism and attempts to enforce Com-
munist principles are now liable to be pun-
ished with death.

Either J. W. Sanger, the U S. commercial
attache at Melbourne, has struck a *oocl
phrase, or the Chicago Tribune has struck
ft for him. “Nearly all Australians, the
Tribune says, reporting Sanger s visit to
Chicago, “have a guaranteed ‘living wage.
The theory that wages can be paid out oi

It was by a mere six votes that the Ram-
say Macdonald Ministry avoided being told
to make a light lunch of its principles and
cive preference to the Dominions in the n <
ter of dried fruits—there were tour divi-
sions, and the figures were steadily 278 and
*>72 The preference on wine, tobacco arm
sugar was defeated by 17 votes It is un-
likely that the Mac Cabinet would have re-
tired even if defeated; but, all the same,
the way is getting rough. Presumably a new
S. African Ministry will find in this a reason
for abolishing its preference to the Cold
Country, and that may be the beginning ot
a landslide. . .
Tariff discrimination in favor of Dominion
raisins, currants, apples, wine, etc., tailed
of the necessary majorities in the Commons
last week, and Charlton, the gloomy Austra-
lian Labor leader, is not exempt from blame.
The proposals were the outcome or the
Economic Conference held when Baldwin
was Prime Minister, and Macdonald, though
personally hostile, agreed to let the House
decide. The Baldwin party voted tor prefer-
ence, and it was significantly joined by a
band of Labor members, whose faith 111 tne
Cobdenite superstition is weakening, hour
more Labor votes would have done the busi-
ness for the growers of raisins and currants,
who are in a bad way, and they ought have
been forthcoming if Macdonald liadn t ae-
clared that Charlton believed in giving
Britain tariff preference but didn t expect
the Old Man to reciprocate, or words to
that effect. No one seems to have questioned
this interpretation of Charlton’s attitude, and
the proposals were voted down. A word in
season from Matt tlie pacifist might have
done the business for the hard-pressed
growers of currants and raisins; and a iavoi-
able opportunity arrived when Bruce met
Parliament in March with the resolutions ot
the Imperial Conference. But Charlton was
so shocked at the discovery that it was pro-
nosed to defend Australia with real forts and
warships, instead of with Communist propa-
ganda and selection-ballot boxes with sliding
panels, that he relapsed into a sullen silence
on the topic of preference and didn t breaK
it until the mischief had been done.
Barr, Lock and Tanner, the Yic. Licenses
Reduction Board (they also constitute the
Liquor Licensing Court) are again making
things lively for hotel landlords and
licensees. They have delicensed another
large batch of Melbourne pubs and
wineshops, and insisted 011 improvements
('450 more bedrooms, for instance) in
other cases. Publication of the Board s
fine work is very embarrassing to Green-
wood and other fanatics who demand the
restoration of local option, which has so
little practical achievement to its credit ana
is so exasperatingly capricious. The Board
has shut 160 dingy grogshops in districts
that voted continuance at the last local-
option poll. , .
“Old Banker”: Many intelligent citizens
fancy that the new bill will permit the Com-
monwealth Bank to take charge of the Lon-
don exchange situation with beneficial effects
to the country. The Treasurer, by intro-
ducing exchange and currency so prominently
into his speech, no doubt gave that impres-
sion But the only vital change in the bank
will be the transfer of control from one man
to a directorate; and that isn’t necessarily
going to accomplish anything. On the other
hand it would apparently be within the
rights of the new Board to decide by a majo-
rity vote that the trading section of the bank
should cease to function. It is said that of
course the Board must determine the policy
of the bank. There is no “of course” about
it The people who own the bank should
lav down the general lines their servants (in
this case the directors) must follow.
Lloyd George voted for the Baldwin-Bruee
preference resolutions ; Asquith opposed them
venomously. The interesting pair are re-
ported to have had other disagreements,
mainly on the subject of the Ramshackle
Ministry, and it begins to be suspected that
the little Welshman, realising that the
“Liberal” Freetraders are hopeless, is pre-
paring for another arrangement with the
Conservatives. One of those who took the
Little England view of preference was Fil-
kington, once a Eerth K.C. Pilkmgton served
a term in the Westralian Assembly, and there
distinguished himself by moving for a reduc-
tion of £150.000 (40 p.c.) in the Education
Department vote. A more reactionary poli-
tician never sat in the Perth House, yet, gee
ing to England, he calls himself a k Liberal
and is elected as such. No wonder the
Liberals are losing their deposits at by-
elections.
From the Gallery:—
If the Cockies are split up over the Bruce-Page
pact, the smaller and more pugnacious fragment will
probably be composed of Stewart and Whitsitt.
Whitsitt, who would easily pass for a retire!
American colonel, gives no hint in his bearing of
the thoughts that frequently boil within him. It
is only when he is on his feet, with a ribald House
encouraging him on, that he splutters furiously to
get his opinions down in Hansard before his tem-
perature has returned to normal. He is the emo-
tional antithesis of Stewart, whose cold ruthlessness
of speech—never so disconcerting, it is alleged, as
at Cabinet meetings—has won him a reputation as
an intractable character. Though admired for his
courage the man from the Mallee is not highly
popular with colleagues like Hill, Gibson, Prowse
and Gregory. His radical views make them shiver.
Lang, of N. S. Wales, who sounds the
most insincere leader that Labor ever had,
has developed what he calls a policy ; and
the two ends of it are in hopeless conflict.
First he wants socialisation; and then he
wants a people’s bank. The present Savings
Hank fills Lang with a fine pretence of
scorn. What does it do? Why, instead ot
the people’s savings going to finance the
people’s private undertakings, the money is
lent to the State to finance public undertaK-
ings. In other words, the money is used to
advance that socialisation of which Lang so
strongly approves; and he professes to be
angry because it isn’t used to promote pri-
vate enterprises of which he strongly dis-
approves. Lang is a clumsy leg-puller.
“I THOUGHT I SMELT CHEESE ”
“The Commonwealth Bank Bill. proposes that the bank shall have eight directors and an unlimited
number of local boards all well paid."
Bananaland has lagged behind the other
States in the matter of abattoirs —it was only
last year that Premier Theodore first talked
seriously of establishing them. The Meat
Advisory Board is in favor, but has not yet
decided whether new shambles should be
built, at Wilston or elsewhere, or whether one
of the meatworks in Brisbane should be
bought. The latter would be the cheaper.
But the question ought first to be faced
whether it is a job for the State or the
municipalities. Why should Cairns and
Cooktown sign a bill to pay for Brisbane s
slaughteryard?
At the eleventh hour: —
Victoria is engaged to-day in electing two-thirds
of a new Legislative Assembly, the other third
having got back unopposed. It looks as if Laboi,
which already has 12 uncontested seats, will ha/e
a tally of 25 or 26, as compared with 22 in the
last House. It is certain to make some gains; the
only question is how many. The Cookies went out
with 13 (including the newly-elected Walter) gnd
are confident of adding Grenville to that lot. They,
too, will in all probability increase. But the Gnashers
will return chastened and weakened —weakened in
numbers and by a cave consisting of some, at least,
ot the rebels who voted against the Redistribution
of Seats Bill. In the former House they had 29,
and 27 is now their rosiest expectation. MeLach
lan, an independent radical, may vote with them if
he gets back. The possibilities are, in this order:
(1) Another Liberal-Cocky Government; (2) a stop-
gap Cocky Ministry; and (3) a Labor Cabinet with
Radical Hayseed support.
In a bad week for Buckley, the expelled
Labor politician wlio is N.S.W. secretary of
the Australian Railwaymen’s Union, a Syd-
ney Industrial Magistrate ruled that a mem-
ber of the organisation who had resigned
wasn’t liable for the arbitration levy of
fl 6s. or a £5 penalty for non-payment. Also,
the State Arbitration Court made hash of the
proceedings of a “special” conference, at
which a governing body was nominated with-
out reference to branch members, Buckley
was secured against summary dismissal and
the rules were “amended” to admit ot a £lO
fine being imposed on any unionist who criti-
cised Bucklev or attended a meeting to dis-
cuss him. The costs in both cases will come
out of branch funds. Union bosses like
Buckley are expensive luxuries.
G. M. Prendergast, who declares that lie
is not unduly optimistic, expects to hear six
additional voices in the Labor Caucus after
to-day’s election in Victoria. He counts* on
capturing Wallialla, Bulla, Mornington, Bal-
larat East, Ballarat West, and cither P ran
or East Melbourne, and he wouldn’t be sur-
prised if Laborite Minogue was returned for
Upper Goulburn. It shows the state of Labor
feeling when its organisers profess hope re-
garding the chances of ex-senior-constable
Cummins against the absent McPliairson in
Hawthorn. Cummins, who lost his job m the
recent police strike, and played more than
a super’s part in the subsequent altercations,
is a line upstanding talker, who holds the
S’African War medal with five bars and the
police medal for valor. But even if he had
a crate of decorations and played goit
with S. M. Bruce, lie couldn t win
Hawthorn. He is the wrong political color,
with the additional disadvantage of having
been connected with a disturbance which
that respectable electorate shudders to re-
member.
Months have elapsed since the Sydney
Communists gave it out that something like
£800” had been subscribed to the Russian
loan —this in a country where it is reckoned
nothing out of the way for one union to
raise £160,000 in strike levies, another to
lose £30.000 in a newspaper and a third to
spend £20,000 on an Arbitration Court case.
Since then Russian bonds have been offered
for sale at every Trades Hall in Australia,
but the result has not been announced. In
fact the subject has been dropped. Asked
what would be done with the money that
came in, Howie, the Sydney Red, thoughtlessly
replied that it would be spent in Australia
on things like agricultural implements and
coal-cutting machines “if it is Possible to
buy the goods cheaply.” Maybe the last ill
chosen word, by summoning up sin *
thoughts of low-wage labor, settled what
little chance the flotation had.
“Afrikaans” explains it: —
The defeat of Janie Smuts for Pretoria West sur-
prised even some Australian pressmen who have a
nodding acquaintance with Africa. They iound it
hard to understand how the Labor man could poll
so heavily in what was once the very heart ol
Boerdom and is to-day the roosting-place of Admini-
stration” civil servants—a class which doesn t vote
numerously for Labor anywhere. A reason for bmutss
defeat may be found in the “Railways Township
which has grown up in West Pretoria s' nce >-
last Boer war. These works are a lesser edition
of Eveleigh (N.S.W.), and are quite as militantij
Labor- a great proportion of the skilled workers aie
English and Scottish artificers. The Labontes weie
determined to get the scalp of the man wlO CIUS '
the Rand strike and the Red rising. Thanks to the
Railway contingent in his electorate, they made a
good job of it.
The Mexican Government's action in
almost kicking the British ( barge d Alt •
out of the blood-stained republic sets the
British Government a problem; for direct
action in reply is almost impossible, m view
of the Yankee’s ever-increasing admiration
for the Monroe doctrine. Probably the
oil combines are the real instigators of these
moves against British interests m Mexico.
It is not long ago that Uncle protested bit
terly against Britain extending her oil in-
terests in Mespot; and he would give a lot
to get his claws ’into British oil interests
in Mexico. The galling part of it is that
it was Canning, a British diplomat, who
first preached the Monroe doctrine to its
Yankee godfather.
On some misguieled enthusiasts
The well-meant murder of the socialist Mattcotu
bv Mussolini’s Fascist supporters recalls the slaughter
of Thomas ft Becket. The assassins meant to please
the King, and, instead, forced Henry to make public
submission to Rome and restore freedom of election
to the monasteries. On Mussolini two disastrous
effects of the later tragedy are that he lias been
compelled to take his enemies, the ex-Premiers
Giolitti and Orlando, into a “Concentration Minis-
try ” and that the British Parliamentary Labor 1 any
has* been given an excuse to express “profound detes-
tation” (of his methods of “trampling on the
fundamental principles of liberty and democracy.
It is quite possible that the Matteotti affair, which m
its genesis was no more, doubtless, than a quiet
castor-oil-and-flogging outing of the conventional
Fascist' type, may bring the crazy Mussolini super-
structure of modern aims and medieval methods to
the ground.
The mail brings details of that report of
the N’York Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.
which has done prohibition no good. Heaths
from alcoholism among members last year
numbered 436. In 1922 there were 293 m
1921 122. And in 1920, before the dry law
became effective, there were only If.
War lias been declared by the Independ-
ent Order of Good Templars, the best-
organised and strongest section of the Pro-
hibitionists in N. S. Wales, the declaration
being practically a breakaway from the
N.S.W. Alliance. The Templars, wlio stand
for an immediate referendum, no compensa-
tion, and no compromise over Prohibition
principles, are annoyed at the willingness
of the Alliance to accept less to go on
with. The members of the Order are
advised, whether they are Nationalists or
Laborites, to get into their local political
leagues and vote for the selection of I rohi-
bition candidates. It appears likely to make
the fight of Brolly v. Bottle warmer than
CV “Poliio”: Dr. Watson, the Commonwealth
historian, scarcely “broke fresh ground
when he ''disparaged the site of Sydney,
though he may have been the first to get his
protest into the Sydney press. The objec-
tions to Port Jackson as a shipping centre
for any part of Australia except the County
of Cumberland are so obvious that even the
London Times as far back as 1910 was
moved to enumerate them. On August - <
of that year it announced gravely that Cap-
tain Cook discovered the wrong place: as for
Port Jackson, “magnificent and almost incom-
parable though its facilities are, it remains
an inlet in the midst of mountains It has
been at once the pride and the bane of New-
South Wales.”
From an exile in Chicago (U.S.A.) :
The Afnerican ballot-paper would baffle a Philadel-
phia lawyer, but the trouble is overcome by the general
advice of “Vote the Ticket.” If one is voting Re-
publican-well, place your X in the circle above
the Republican list of candidates. Democrats the
same. The cosmopolitan hordes that go to the poll
place the X in the circle, and thus dodge the necessity
of an X before each candidate. And so the Boss
and the machine score. Truly it is the day of the
Boss and the machine. Some of the new Central
European republics have gone even further. There
the ballot-paper doesn’t even mention the name of
the candidate. You just vote for this or that party,
and leave it to the bosses of the party to provide
the party representatives. Poor old democracy is
getting a pretty rough deal these times one way and
another.

were nearly £55,000 better than in the half-
year of 1921 which gave abnormally large
exchange earnings and prompted the direc-
tors to distribute a lOs.-per-share bonus as
a “special exception.” During the past six
months, however, the Wales paid only
£106,635 in taxes against £153,429 in the
1921 term; on the other hand, in order to
transfer accumulations in London for em-
ployment in Australia, the management says
it was put “to great cost.” The published
accounts do not go into details, and there is
no way of learning how the shifting of funds
affected earnings. Possibly the disclosure of
record profits was prompted chiefly by the
brighter outlook all round, especially for the
agricultural and pastoral industries; with
prospects of a good season and favorable mar-
kets, the B.N.S.W. management probably
decided that at this latest balance there was
less need to add materially to its already very
large inner reserves, which provide for
numerous contingencies.
The most striking feature of the introduc-
tory table is that, though in 10 years paid
capital has moved from 3J to six millions,
and though the 10 p.c. div. has been
paid throughout on all this new capi-
tal, the lay-by was greater for the
past halt-year than for any other term,
notwithstanding much heavier running
exes., greatly increased taxation and the cost
of the abnormal exchange position. Dis-
closed profit-earning is not, however, quite so
good as it used to be: just prior to the war
six millions of funds were producing profits
at the rate of 9.2 p.c. p.a. j lately more than
10 millions have been giving slightly under
9 p.c. The figures manager Oscar Lines
shows his Board may. of course, be very
different; indeed, though costs have no doubt
increased in every corner, it is not impro-
bable that the Wales is doing quite as well
as it did 10 years ago. Certainly interest
rates are higher, and so is the proportion of
revenue-earning assets. In 1914 23.3 p.c. of the
liquid assets were in Government securities
and out at short call; at March 31 last the
interest-earning portion was 30.6 p.c. of all
liquid assets. Here are comparisons of aggre-
gate figures :

years ago. Altogether £21,400,000 more is
contributing to income.

ments over 10 years and for the past 12

The Wales continues to maintain its cus-
tomary strength for the people who have en-
trusted their money to it. Slightly more
than half of all outside debt is in liquid form
and the best Government securities. The
bank’s own visible funds now total
£10,213,159, and for every £1 of them it
holds £6 Bs. of the public’s money, which is
well within the recognised safe trading limit.
One interesting feature of the table of
balance-sheet figures is the increase of notes.
,y^ a^es s issues its own paper in
Maoriland, and the printing press was put
mto action during the past 12 months to re-
lieve the strain of financing produce bills on
London.
Exchange and currency are at present the
two big problems of the banker, and thev
are closely inter-related. The published
balance-sheets of the banks are not illumina-
tive on the subject of the amount of money
..,. U P in London ; but without doubt there are
millions there which cannot be shifted to
the Commonwealth, because at both ends are
inconvertible paper currencies. Mostly
on account of the. good prices obtained for
products, deposits in the Commonwealth and
have expanded more than 16J
millions in 12 months. But while the pro-
ducer and others have been credited with
the proceeds of these sales by the banks
negotiating the bills, the banks have had no
corresponding increase in their cash holdings.
Returns for the March quarters of the past
three years show that the preeentage of bul-
lion, coin and legal-tender notes to all liabili-
ties to the public has declined from 21.3 p.c.,
to 18.7 p.c., to 17.6 p.c. this year. So
though the Commonwealth is, on paper, better
off, because other countries have bought our
produce at remunerative prices, we haven’t
received the money; the only acceptable
international means of payment, gold, hav-
ing been abandoned, buyers’ financiers in
London have been unable to effect a
settlement in the Commonwealth. Funds
banked up in London are at present
employable there only; and a large
Part of the additional “income” which the
public wishes to use in the Commonwealth is
not represented by available money. The
banks unanimously say that the circum-
stances warrant at least a temporary increase
of the Australian note issue. The bank? in
Maoriland, having a free hand within statu-
tory limitations, have enlarged their issues
of paper. But the Australian Notes Board,
evidently scared into inaction by the “infla-
tion” bogey—-which, of course, can be a very
real menace if not properly curbed—refuses
to budge. The Notes Board’s attitude is
governed largely, if not wholly, by academic
theories, instead of by actual experience of
currencies;. and, in the circumstances, the
opinion of life-long bankers should carry more
weight. The squeeze in the Commonwealth
lias been felt in Maoriland, and as the
Dominion is working with an elastic currency
the opinions of the Bank of New Zealand
management on the Australian nosition. pre-
sented in Wellington only last Friday, are of
interest:—
Ihe Australian Note Board lias recently decided
not to make any further issues of notes, even in
exehange for an equivalent of sovereigns That
the Board has adopted this policy in what it believes
to be the best interests of the Commonwealth is not
questioned, but the point is this: Have the members
ot the Board the information at their command to
enable them to determine what amount of currency
is required from time to time to satisfy the needs of
commerce and production? Surely the joint-stock
banks, with their intimate and detailed knowledge of
financial conditions, should be the better jud«-es' -
Another consequence of the shortage of currency is
that the average rate on overdrafts is higher than in
Maoriland, despite the much-heavier income-tax paid
by the banks in the Dominion. ... Opponents argue
that extension oi the note issue would lead to inflation
and consequent increase in the cost of living. It
would seem, however, that this is not even’ good
theory, much less practice, for the highest authorities
on finatice and banking in England have declared that
there can be no inflation in a country where the
currency is properly adjusted to its real needs. In
M.L. the banks see to this, and having both theory
and practice to guide them, the currency question pre-
sents no difficulties. It is worth mentioning that
the notes in the hands of the public in Australia are
less on a population basis than in M.L. Develop-
ment of the country and extension of its trade are
beneficial to the banks, but inflation is not, and is
therefore not encouraged.

The Provident Life took over a small Indus-
trial business 20 years back and has been
writing Ordinary policies only since 1908.
Development has been on' sound lines; con-
trol is from Dunedin, and the management
has handled the bawbees thriftily. The co.
has never engaged in costly policy-writing
campaigns, which are generally a gamble on
the future recouping the outlay; instead it
has been satisfied to harvest small volumes
of healthy business. Consequently the
figures are not large considering the co.’s
age. In recent years, however, progress has
been more rapid: in 10 years premium in-
has almost trebled, and assurance
funds are six times greater. Ordinary, Acci-
dent and Industrial figures combined give
these comparisons:—

The results of the management’s conservative
policy is shown in a striking manner by the
report of the actuary, the latest quinquennial
investigation having been made as at Decem-
*3eV. . l as C When valuing liabilities under
policies the Provident assumes that funds
will in future earn only Si p.c., a half-point
less than most small offices allow. The
Ordinary funds were found to be
£26,228 in excess of the estimated liabilities
to policy-holders, and that was sufficient to
warrant the allotment of reversionary bonuses
as follows : Whole-life, 30s. per £lOO of assur-
ance; endowment assurance, 255. p.c.; pure
endowment, 10s. p.c. In the Industrial
branch, where the rate of interest assumed
is also 31 p.c., a surplus of £4llO was dis-
closed. Ihe generally improved position has
permitted the management to increase the
div. rate a point for shareholders. For some
years they have had 5 p.c. p.a. from the In-
dustrial branch and 1 p.c. from Ordinary
and Accident operations; so even the extra
bit for the current quinquennium won’t make
shareholders bilious. However, if expansion
continues on the recent scale, proprietors
can confidently expect something fatter.
The all-in expense rate in the Ordinary
branch last year was 17 p.c. of income, a
slight increase on the previous 12 months.
Nevertheless, costs are still moderate: on the
reckoning that new business (1104 policies
assuring £314,031 were written during the
year) is 10 times costlier than old, the Provi-
dent’s renewals rate is 10 p.c. and the new-
busmess cost 100 p.c. Ten years back Indus-
trial exes, took 60.5 p.c. of the income of
that branch, but they had been steadily pruned
to 40.75 p.c. last year. Meanwhile, other
factors contributing to surpluses are satisfac-
tory: (1) the claims experience has been
well within the expectancy; (2) Ordinary
funds are averaging £5 17s. 3d. p.c. interest;
(3) the Industrial section is earning interest
at the rate of £5 ss. 2d. p.c. on funds ; and
(4) the balance-sheet position generally is
healthy. No goodwill account of any sort
disfigures the balance-sheet. At December 31
Government and municipal securities and
other gilt-edged investments accounted for
89 p.c. of all assets; loans on policies, 4.2
p.c.; mortgages, 2.5 p.c.; premises, 1.4 p.c.
A feature of the balance-sheet is that on a
total premium income of £133,000, at the bal-
ancing date there were no outstanding pre-
miums whatever in the Ordinary branch and
only £lB5 in the Industrial.

This Extended co. controls three subsidiaries :
(1) Arthur Rickard & Co., Ltd., subdivisionists and
property salesmen. The co. holds every one of the
275,000 £1 shares.
(2) Hotel Sydney, Ltd., a reconstruction of the
Central Railway Palace Buildings, Ltd., which put
up the Hotel Sydney. It holds 100,874 of the
130,000 £1 fully-paids.
(3) The Haymarket Permanent Land, Building and
Investment Co., I.td., an old concern which was taken
into the Rickard stable 10 years ago by purchasing
49,722 of its 50,000 £2 shares fully-paid.
The Extended is an unusual type of holding
co.; greatly to its credit it issues reports and
accounts for each of the three subsidiaries,
and the investor who cares to go to the
trouble Can get some idea of how each enter-
prise is faring, and how the money he put
into the parent co. has been employed. The
parent makes its published accounts a little
brighter by taking into its reserves, quite
legitimately, its share of the undivided pro-
fits of the subsidiaries. These transfers
have totted up: A. R. and Co., £35,208:
Haymarket, £21,878. The two thus account
for £57,086 of the parent’s total reserves of
£70,424 when the past year’s divs. had been
paid.
The principal event of the year was the
reconstruction of the Hotel Sydney co. Its
earnings had been so handsome that the
directors decided to issue scrip against the
appreciation of city property values. In
one move paid capital was increased from
£65,000 to £130,000, and the parent co. added
£37,428 to its reserves as its share of the
paper profit. Its holding in the hotel co
at December 31 last was £100,874 against
£82,876 12 months previously. The Hotel
Sydney has been paying 10 p.c. on its in-
flated capital, but whether the business can
pay that rate regularly and provide fully for
renewals and lease-depreciation is more than
the “Wild Cat” would care to guarantee.
The expansion of reserves by the bonus scrip
issue from the hotel co. prompted the parent
to capitalise £50,000, and just prior to the
accounts closing one fully-paid ordinary was
issued for every three previously held. These
new shares have so far carried no div. If all
the ordinaries are to receive 8 p.c., much
larger earnings will be needed; divs. and
interest last year gave the parent co.
£34,324 after paying its own exes. The
surplus held by the subsidiaries, though taken
into the Extended co.’s accounts, cannot be
treated as distributable profit. A new issue
of 50,000 8 p.c. £1 prefs. is now being
offered, and pref. divs. alone will in future
require £24,000, while 8 p.c. div. on all shares
will need £40,000, which is some thousands
more than present distributable surpluses.
That, of course, makes no allowance for
earnings of the new capital. On the evi-
dence available, the issue of bonus shares
does not appear to have been justified.
The outstanding feature of the Arthur
Rickard business is that the laud-selling and
subdivisioning co., which in the active markets
of recent years might reasonably have been
expected to show handsome returns, is earn-
ing only small profits. On total capital and
reserves, last year’s £15,259 gave a trifle
under 5 p.c., and on paid capital alone only
0.0 p.c. Indeed, profits are decidedly lean
considering that at December 31, besides its
own funds of £310,208, this subsidiary had
the use of £145,198 raised on mortgage or
owing on properties, and had borrowed
£11,741 from the parent co. If 5 p.c. is the
best the co. can show under fairly favorable
conditions, what can be expected in depressed
times? The Hotel Sydney is the best-paying
subsidiary: it returned 13f p.c. on the Ric-
kard holding last year. Meanwhile, the Hay-
market Co. is doing better: profits last year
were a' trifle more than 10 p.c. on its capital,
but only 6 p.c. was distributed so that the
co.’s position could be strengthened.
Outside liabilities of the parent and three
subsidiary cos. at December 31 were as fol-
lows :

A big unexplained item is the £142,451 of
shares and debentures which the Arthur
Rickard sub®diary holds in “others cos. and
joint enterprises.” What they are and how
they fare arc office secrets, and shareholders
might reasonably seek infortaation about
them.
The notable features of the amalgamated
figures are (1) the size of outside liabili-
ties and smallness of liquid assets; (2) the
amounts locked up in properties, both rent-
earning and unproductive; and (3) the vol-
ume of purchasers’ balances and other boob
debts. The» position of the associated cos.
generally defends on the soundness of book
values, especially of those assets for which
a mar ket has yet to be found. On that point
there is no evidence, though the writing up
of the Hotel Sydney tells what has happened
in one corner of the business. Obviously
Arthur Rickard Extended is not an invest-
ment for the weak-hearted; moreover, con-
sidering the risks, 8 p.c. is not an attractive
rate for ordinaries. Their scrip tots up
£200,000, and ahead of them for divs. and
security are two lots of 8 p.c. prefs. totalling
£250,000, which will be increased to £300,01K)
if the new issue is fully subscribed.

ThP position at the Barrier does not alter
these days. With the exception of the
recently! labor thought the time oppor-
tune to hit the boss up. Negotiations were
K but by then lead was dropping, so they
came to naught, and work continues on the
old basis. ....
George Weir’s North-British combination
continues to treat nearly 9000 tons weekly.
Work proceeds on each of these mines exact y
us it did prior to the fusion, and the on y
Moparent economy is that there is no British
directorate to get fees. Cyril Emery remains
at the British, and there is no sign of any
attempt to consolidate treatment plants, llie
North accounts for the year closing June 30
will be interesting, as they will incorporate
the British assets for the first time. A big
credit balance in the P. and L. account should
be shown in view of the high average price
of lead. ....
At the South production and grade of ore
have been affected for months past by the
bottom levels having been rendered inacces-
sible through the burning Central s flooding
operations. Drastic measures are being
adopted to prevent a recurrence of such
trouble, and a big addition to the pumping
plant is in hand. Later on increased output
may be looked for. The South staff has been
compelled to face some mighty tough pro-
blems since the Central fire started, and these
have been handled in a highly creditable man-
ner. It has required keen generalship to keep
the'output going. ....
The new treatment plant of the Zinc Corp.
has received its christening, and is now being
got into form. Z.C. costs are about the best
on the line, and although silver values are low
in the South Blocks, the lead content has im-
proved, and high metal recoveries m treat-
ment have made work very profitable. Un-
derground developments have been very satis-
factory, and there is promise of a long file
for the show. The co. is in a snug position,
and although there is an irksome preference
share plaster the income from invested tunas
nowadays just about takes care of the pref.
dividend. Rumor says there will eventually
he a South-Zinc fusion. Bill Robinson is now
on the London Board of the Zinc,. and it
won’t be his fault if the amalgamation does
not come about. Certainly it would help the
South eventually in determining its policy
in connection with the working of its large
more or less low-grade ore-body running on to
the South Blocks boundary.
The Central position is not improved,
judging by the official silence. Various
attempts have been made to re-open certain
sections of the mine, but it is evident that
the fire is still burning. The vast width of
the original ore-body filled with tens of thou-
sands of tons of splintered oregon makes tor
insuperable difficulties in fire-fighting.
General-manager Courtney came trom Lon-
don recently to confer with the men on the
job. Meanwhile the recently-acquired Junc-
tion is producing about 1000 tons weekly, and
this, added to some dump slime, keeps the
Central mill going one shift daily. Even
this programme is, however, dependent tor its
continuance on high metal markets, and the
Central staff is not happy.
The Prop, is treating its own and Block 14
ore, and has had to clear up some of the
troubles which always come up with a radical
change of treatment such as it adopted early
this vear. The Prop, has just aemured Block
10 at a salvage valuation of £BOOO, but it is
doubtful if any substantial percentage of the
remaining ore can be won from the latter
property. This sale recalls that a couple ot
years ago two or three Adelaide brokers
offered to amalgamate Block 10, Block 14
and the Junction, and provide substantial
working capital, but negotiations fell through,
the principal reason being that .Block lv
would not agree to the Junction being valued
at about the same figure as its own mine.
The Junction was afterwards sold tor £7o UUU
—more than nine times the amount now paid
for Block 10. ....
Junction North is re-opening its mine, and
that means hard work ahead for someone,
because, with the exception of a Period ot
a few weeks at end of 1920 and early 1921, it
has been closed for five years. Dump slime is
being put through the retreatment plant,
but the tonnage remaining is not great, home
work is being done at the but that
will be an expensive show to handle..
De Bavay’s is closed, and some of the
plant is being dismantled. It will take a
long time to ship the many thousands ot
tons of zinc concentrates on hand, and this
will keep a few men employed. The show
might easily have been given a little longer
life by purchasing the big slime dump of the
North Co. for treatment. This dump of
nearly half a million tons of rich slime is
right alongside the De Bavay plant.
The two explosions at the Commonwealth
Oil Refineries plant were nothing to the row
that threatened when Prime Minister Bruce
asked for an additional quarter-million to
put into that 50-50 show—the Commonwealth
and the Anglo-Persian Co. have each a halt-
share. Already a half-million has gone in
works, which, after four years _ of weary
waiting, have got to the exploding stage,
suggesting that there may be a part ot tne
Anglo-PerSian plant which isn t what it
should be. A big burn took place not long
back in a Persian Gulf works, and informa-
tion about that would be welcome, if it could
be got. The quarter-million is to be bor-
rowed, and will be used as working capital
to run the distributing side of the business.
Bruce’s plea is that the refinery is needed to
relieve the Commonwealth of the stranglehold
which the foreigner has on the Australian
market, and also to assure a market for
crudes if supplies of petroleum are tapped
in the Commonwealth or Papua. But
it isn’t going to be an easy win: this
Australian market has yielded too many
profits to be given up to a semi-State
project without a fight. Parliament having
voted the funds, it will be interesting to
watch market prices; though the Government
is nominally the controlling shareholder m
the C.0.R., what part it will play in price-
fixing remains doubtful. Some people
don’t forget that, though the British Gov-
ernment is a big holder in the Ang o-
Persian, there is nearly as much growling
about oil prices in England as in Australia.

“W’gabba” on the Isa-Broken Hill com-
parison:—
“Argent’s” remarks on Mt. Isa (B. 19/6/’24)
are rather depressing. A few irresponsibles may
have called it another Broken Hill, and the com-
parison was inevitable as soon as it became apparent
that Mt. Isa was destined to be an important silver-
lead field. But neither Corbould nor Govt. Geologist
St. Smith, to cite two of the principals, thought of
it as another Broken Hi If. The two deposits in
mode of occurrence and mineralogical association
are widely divergent. B.H. dazzled with the rich-
ness of its oxide and carbonate zones. Mt. Isa lias
a chance of dazzling with lower-grade ore; from
indications in work to a depth of 100 ft., Mt.
Isa’s reserves have a big chance of proving
larger. Corbould himself does not consider that there
will be any wonderful enrichment at Mt. Isa, but
for all that several small patches of ore assaying
up to SOOOoz. have been unearthed. Last November,
St. Smith reported samples from the Crystal assaying
62.3 p.c. and 62.4 p.c. lead, with 19600 z. and
20900 z silver respectively. The occurrence of several
gossan bodies points to likely enrichment “Argon,
is misleading as to ore values in the statement that
the lodes in places contain from 10 to 30 o ™ ces
silver and 20 p.c. lead. Silver is rarely below 50oz.
to the ton, unless there is a considerable amount 01
country in the ore taken. St. Spilth’s average
analysis of the whole of the ore sold up to September
last' was lead 64 p.c., silver 550 z. per ton. Some
of the lodes have already Deen proved for a vertical
range of 300 ft. by the outcrops on the high ridges,
plus the workings nearly 100 ft. below the surface.
1 venture the opinion that if the lodes live down
IOOOft. in anything like their present form near the
surface, Broken Hill will be surpassed in output.
Only fools would rush in to predict what they will
be like at 1000 ft. to 2000 ft., but meantime, until
some deep shafts go down, let us take comfort from
the following interpretation of present evidence by
B. Dunstan, Chief Geologist of Queensland: The
abundance of ore-bands and lodes is a marvellous
feature of the field, and although their outcrops
ale no- the surface have not yet been proved to lie
continuous in the regularly bedded rocks, _ it seems
almost impossible that tney do not continue both
along the surface and to considerable depth below.
1 * * *
Tlie probable importance of the Mt. Isa
field, and consequently the need for an
early geological survey, has been respon-
sible for the Queensland Government
approving of an aerial survey for the purpose
of rapidly compiling a map showing the topo-
graphical features of the field. Dunstan will
personally take charge, and his staff will be
camped on the field. A contour map will be
produced, and a second geological report is
promised in the near future. The aerial sur-
vey is an innovation for Australian geolo„i
cal practice, but it has been carried out
in Canada and U.S.A., and probably else-
where. A theodolite survey of the area 91
about 20 sq. miles would probably take six
months, as there is considerable surface re-
lief so that at least five months should be
saved in this work. The first report on the
field was a general one, but m the next
Dunstan will tackle the question of values
and permanence of the ore bodies, and
general methods of development will be dis-
cussed.
When W. H. Corbould was gathering
leases for the Mt. Isa Mines float, the south
end of the field did not appear to offer much.
Then came John Brandons Mt. Isa South
float and development has suggested that
there is much more in that section than was
expected. The big co. has, therefore, sug-
rrested a merger; it has offered 3ooQ fullj-
paid' shares for the properties. This gives
the South holder 31 £2O-paids for every 100
£1 shares in his co. The South had a pre-
liminary meeting in Melbourne on Monday,
and the directors urged shareholders to accept
the terms.
From Randolph Bedford :
Pars, re Isa Prop. (B. 19/6/’24) are misleading.
To quote:
The Prop, is bagging some of the high-grade
stuff, no doubt with the object of easing finances
for the purchase of the properties; it raised £20,0u0
in contnbs., paid £2500 cash and 60,000 shares to
vendors, and to acquire the leases it must find
£26,250 cash, besides allotting £15,000 of shares.
The £2500 cash to vendors was part of the pur-
chase ; after the July payment of £2500 completion
of purchase is made by payment of £21,250 m
January, 1925, and no further shares are to be
issued on that account. As to the amalgamation
suggestions,, 500 Mt. Isas cannot be taken at
£200,000, but only at half that, the face value
the only way to estimate unissued and deterred
shares. But for “amalgamation” talk, Prop, shares
would probably have doubled their market value oi
£35,000 ; developments entitle them to that. VVe
did not seek amalgamation ; the other co. did, where-
upon I mentioned the only figure to be considered
as “all the reserve shares” in Isa Mines, Ltd.
Their suggestion was on an acreage basis, and the
Proprietary isn’t mere acreage, but real mines in
the making.
No. 4 North Phmnix, Gympie (Q.), cleaned
up a crushing of 130 tons ore last week for
of 7780 z. smelted gold., an average
of almost 6oz. The ore is coming from the
north stopes above and below the 7841 t. e ,
and the reef is averaging only bin., thus
explaining the limited tonnages available re-
cently. Indications are that this reef wil
see the year out at about the same pace.
For the first time in its 26 yearsTvanhoe
(W.A.) operated at a loss for the 12 months
ended December last The mill put through
148,036 tons for 59,5310 z. (fine), worth
£270,313, and interest earnings were TS2BJ
but mining and treatment costs took ££o4,,
£16,008 was spent on development and plant,
and when administrative ,exes-
debited and provision made for taxes, a loss
of £5341 showed up. The worst feature was
that the 148,000 tons treated were from the
co.’s best reserves. One trouble is that treat
ment and power plants are too large for ton-
nages that can be won under existing condi-
tions The average for 645,276 tons of. re-
serves is 325. 5d., but last year costsi ran into
365. 6.4 d. against an extraction of 345. l.Jd.
from the better-grade stuff mined. it
output could be increased to 20,000 tons per
month, profits could be squeezed from ore
averaging 325.; but as tonnages cannot be
improved, the only alternative to r e-arrange
plant on a smaller scale. The directors
called in manager Vail, of the Lake View and
Star, which has remodelled its plant, to help
them decide on a policy for future working
The result of the conference is that an amai
gamation of the two cos. is now proiiosed
Since 1897 Ivanhoe has won 2 3 million
ounces gold from 4.682,470 tons, and from
earnings of £10.925,387 has given share-
holders £3,952,500 in divs.

Miners on the Westralian goldfields intend
asking the Arbitration Court for a 00-hour
week and £1 per shift, which is now paid
tributors’ employees in most of the mines at
and beyond Kalgoorlie. Judged by the rate
of wages ruling in other industries, the re-
quest seems reasonable enough, but the fly
in the ointment is that gold-mining is not m
a condition to carry any increased expendi-
ture. * ,
Hampton Properties (W.A.) is ! tree-
ing ore on its Mt. Martin mine for a return
of less than 255. per. ton. There is no hope
of a profit from this grade. Nothing less
than 40s. ore seems to be profitable in the
West just now. Even Kalgoorlie cos. witn
their big outputs cannot get all-in exes, much
below that figure. #
Some Westralian shareholders object to
being kept in the dark regarding the doings
of the Sydney-controlled Lloyd George. In
January'last the mine was handed over to
tributors. Since then no returns have been
rmblished locally. Tributors are known to
have done very well, but to what extent the
co. has benefited is not revealed; hence the
complaints. #
The 12 tributors in the Lloyd George
fW A ) have had another crushing; old tons
gave 3600 z. of £4 Is. 6d. gold, thus demon-
strating that the 360 tons for 4200 z. m May
was no fluke. #
On the advice of Teddy Dyason the Ben-
digo Amalgamated has decided to a Uow th e
liquidator to pay a sixpenny cal at once,
and others as he may decide, on the holding
of 11,390 shares in the Ironbark mine. Mean-
while 10.000 fully-paid Carlisles and the same
number of Hercules shares are to be distri-
buted among Amalgamated shareholders. The
Ironbark is to be tried to see if the Hercules
run of stone extends into it, and as the Her
cules is rising in the south end of its loSOtt.
level it will soon be found out if the shoot
of gold extends that far. # #
“Old Alluvialist”; New Langi Logau
admits to a debit of just on £200,000 in its
development account; and plant and adminis
tration costs have taken all the gold won.
R. L. Ray is at the helm now, and has
as skipper George Bryant, but neither he
nor the astute Alex. Peacock let out what
area of wash is awaiting the pick. Neither
do they tell if the ground is green or
drained, nor whether the 2oz. average of the
small lots sent to the machines during the
last six months can be regarded as a lair
sample of the dirt being drained. These its
and doubts as to how many miners will return
to the industry under contract conditions
haven’t stopped the directors from slicing
calls down to 2d. All the talk about more
miners being available, is explained by 1W
sewerage workers having been sent to the
rightabout at Ballarat. Bryant s estimate
is that with 25 p.c. more work done under-
ground the 35dwt. dirt im the north end of
the mine would give profits, and he talks
of thousands of fathoms of wash to come out.

“Van Cat” : At Corbie the incoming Aus-

thing. Immaculately attired in frock-coats
-rid top-hats, a party of hilarious souls
arrived at American H.Q., where
speaking broken English, asked for the com-

officers to enable the Governor to convey the
thanks of the Department to the glorious
American Army; and in reply the Yankee
officer assured the visitors that the days
function would cement the bonds of affection
more firmly than ever between Ins country
and France. After a visit to the mess-tent,
the Governor and his party were ceremoni-
ously escorted to the camp boundaries and
footed it back to Corbie. When the story
leaked out it was with great difficulty that
Governors of other Departments were re
strained from paying their compliments to
Uncle Sam’s warriors.

“V.C.”: Nugget was 48 and short-winded;
he had sneaked into the A.I.F. by subtracting
seven years from his tally. On the voyage
over he was let down lightly, but on Sails-
burv Plain we were handed over to an un-
discriminating Tommy jerks-instructor, who
soon had all of us going for our lives. It
was a case of bellows-to-mend with Nugget,
and he fell out. The instructor swooped
upon him. “What’s the matter with you, , my
man?” “I’m too old for that sort of stuff,
puffed the veteran. “How old are you?
“Forty-eight,” replied Nug, adversity making
him truthful. “Forty-eight,” snarled the
Tommy. “Why, the Romans did this exer ;

panted Nug; “I’m not a Roman, Im a Wes-

“Centurion”: “Saaedi’s” remarks on the
delousing ceremonies carried out in Egypt (B.
5/6/’24) recall that Jerry occasionally
added some features to these shows that
were quite outside the official programme.
When El Mazaar was the terminus ot tne
Desert Railway, before El Arisli was occu-
pied, a “delousing tank,” something like a
big petrol waggon, was run up and put on
a siding. The regiments of the Anzac
Mounted Division used to ride m to the line,
strip to the buff, and stand to horses while
their togs were being steamed. On several
of these occasions German airmen arrived
on bombing bent. The target afforded by
the massed neddies along the line was so
obvious that nobody lingered in the vicinity,
and the sandy landscape would be covered
with blaspheming nudes scattering with their
beloved prads in all directions. It was just
before Christmas, too, and it can be chil y
even in Sinai in December. Queerly enough,
many horses that hailed their clothed riders
as blood brethren were anything but enthusi-
astic about them in the altogether.
“Yarriim” : Once, in my youthful days at
Wollongong (N.S.W.), I was beguiled into

There were 50 investors; 1

two more people to throw.

walked up the street, where
a bloke offered me £3 for my
chance. I took it. On
going back we found one of
the late arrivals had tossed
53. Next morning, early, the
winner, with a new halter,
went after his neddy and
found him dead. Ife had,
apparently, been that way
for a week. Yet some people
take exception to two-up!

“Anaf” : A Sydney profes-
sional man owns a collection
of carvings in stone, marble
and other media, made by
prisoners serving sentences
in different Australian
gaols. The production of
curios like these is a fre-
quent occupation in gaols;
it is done furtively, and the
artists are generally men
serving long sentences. Often
their only tools are pieces of
metal smuggled into their
cells from the workshops—
one man completed in gran-
ite a piece containing three
figures and a lot of detail
with no other instrument
than a broken cold chisel.
A feature that xnay interest
psychologists is that the
subjects of the carvings are
nearly always of an unplea-
sant and repellent nature,
some of them revoltingly so,
for which reason a collection
like the above could never
be exhibited publicly. Many
of the objects in it took a
year or more to finish, and
when completed were
smuggled out of tlie prison by released con-
victs, who subsequently sold them.

“Pancliaz”: “Trooper Ketch’s” tale of the

he and his five co-operators fired to kill in
order to spare the shuddering sergeant of
the provost-marshal’s guard the task of kill-
ing the victim. Did their consideration spare
the sergeant much? At all military execu-
tions the revolver is used even when, there
is not the slightest need for it. -The officer
or sergeant detailed for the business marches
up to the victim and places the revolver
against his ear and pulls the trigger. That
precaution wipes out the last flickering
doubt.

and mended an
occasional broken

due time, he
broached the matter
he had in mind.
“Mrs. Jim,” said
he, “it’s pretty

“M.” on some naval pioneers:—
“Delver” (B. 8/5/ , 24) is
right when he states that the
Lady Nelson, in charge oi
Lieut. Grant, made her flr.it
appearance in Port Jackson on
Dec. 16, 1800. But he is m
error when he adds that two
months later the same little
ship, commanded by Ll ® ut ;
James Murray, entered Port
Phillip,” and that, a month
subsequent to that discovery,
“the Lady Nelson, with Grant
again in command, was sur-
veying on the Victorian coast.”
Grant had left Australia ior
good nearly a year before. As
for Murray—John, not James
he was doing duty on a.n-
other ship when “Delver” pic-
tures him as entering Pent
Phillip. Three months after
her arrival in these waters, the
Lady Nelson, under Grant's
command, was despatched on a
cruise in Bass Strait, but on
that occasion got no further
west than Western Port. On
returning to Port Jackson aftei
three months’ absence, Grant
threw up his job and embarked
for England. He was succeeded
by Murray. Another cruise
was undertaken in Nov., 1801,
when Port Phillip was seen by
Bowen (the mate of the vessel)
on Jan. 5, 1802, and entered
by the Lady Nelson on Feb. 15
—just 15 months after her first
arrival in Port Jackson. It
is worth noting that when the
Lady Nelson visited Port
Phillip, her crew included the
notorious adventurer, Jorgen
Jorgenson —under the alias of
Johnson the future ruler of
Iceland was then serving in
the humble capacity of cabin
steward; later he rose to the
position of mate. By- his own
account, Jorgenson first joined
the vessel at the Cape, of bis
own free will, but on Grant’s evidence he was
shipped from there as a convict, and received his
ticket-of-leave on his arrival here. He claimed to be
the first man to harpoon a whale in the estuary of
the Derwent; this was after he left the Lady Nelson
to become mate of the whaler Alexander.

“Machete” : Louis Hart, habitual criminal
and gaol-breaker, may have much to answer
for, but his attempt to annihilate a press
photographer ought to count to his credit.
When landing from the train in Sydney,
after his capture near Bega, he found the
usual army of ghouls waiting to broadcast
the spectacle of a hunted wretch securely
fastened up with “the ratchets” between two
detectives. He made a frantic rush at the

by his escort. The detestable custom of
photographing accused persons in custody
long before the question of their guilt can
possibly be settled is so unjust as well as
cruel that it might well be ruled out by law.
In this matter Hart has a better sense of
justice than Parliament has shown.

And now will come the sunsets wild again,
The cold grey evenings; and along thepane,
mown branches, tapping, tapping. In the sticet,
Muted and covered o’er with quiet rain,

And now will come, swift o’er the barren tree,
A darkness brooding in the heart of me—
A yearning mournfulness that has its biith
In every drooping cloud hung drearily
And the dead leaves that stain the sodden earth.
And now will come sweet dreams of lovely things—
Pale almond-boughs and the wet purple wings
Of fragrant violets, hills flowery gay
And the first mornings when the blackbird sings.
But, heart of joy, these are so far away!

“Hoi semarine” : In answer to ‘‘Delver s
inquiry (B. 8/5/’24) it may be stated that
Cape Liptrap was named by Lieut. Grant, ot
HM S Lady Nelson, after one of Ins junior
officers. Most naval officers who in those
times were associated with marine and coast
survey had their names perpetuated on
Admiralty charts. The custom has been
carried on up to the present, and the naming
of an island in the Gulf of Carpentaria after
a somewhat celebrated Mrs. Publichouse
which was recently done on an Admiralty
survey is no change for the better, -the
native name was Mulawaddy, and it should
have been left at that.' The serving of grog
a thousand miles away by an elderly Hebe
does not seem to be a justification for the
honor of inclusion in the world s geography.

“Gouger”: It is a fact that a big-gun shell
in full flight can sometimes be seen by the
naked eye (B. 5/6/’24). On Gallipoli a
howitzer used to fire from near the beach
straight over our regiment- As the flying
shell passed immediately over the crown of
the big ridge on which we had our trenches,
and providing there was a low, darkish cloud
right above, keen eyes could distinctly see the
shell in its crescendo flight. The eyes had to be
fixed on the exact line of flight; in the
same way one could at times follow the
course of a bomb dropping from a plane.
I suppose thousands of men saw the hand-
grenade coming that hit them. I know I
did. Or, rather, the sparks of the fuse, lhe

“Pusser” : Despite “X.N.0.” (B. 12/6/ 24 )
on the Navy idea of desertion, intent does
count. The Navy defines a deserter as one
who absents himself from his ship or place
of duty with the intention of not returning;
It follows that a man may be declared a
deserter at once if his intention not. to re-
turn is clear. Normally desertion is pre-
sumed after seven days’ absence; this places
the onus on the offender to prove that he
meant to return after his fling. I once knew
a budding Nelson who had the misfortune
to burn a farmer’s cart whilst on a long-
leave camp. Unable to foot the bill, he
volunteered to take it out as a workmg-hand.
The offer was accepted, and after something
like four weeks’ absence the lad returned to
his ship with documentary evidence of what
he had been doing, and why. The charge
against him was amended to read: Did re-
main absent over leave 600 hours without
intent to desert.” He was punished as an
absentee only.

“Morob” : “Jimmy Darwin’s” abo. who was 1
upset at being nearly locked out of the gaol
one night (B.
29/5/’24) woulu
not be counted an
unusual person in
New Guinea and
New Britain. I
remember one bush
Kanaka in the
Morobe district who
was sentenced to
six months by the
District Officer. It
was almost impos-
sible to make him
realise that he was
being punished, for
the regular an d
substantial prison
rations, blankets,
and a comfortable
place in which to
sleep, to say no-
thing of the pos-
session of a fetch-
ing blue “lap-lap,”
charmingly deco-
rated with large
white arrows, gave
him the idea that,
the D.O. had taken
a particular liking
to. him. The six
months passed' all
too quickly, and
when the prisoner
found himself sud-
denly at liberty he
was anguished be-
yond expression by
the deprivation of
his possessions and
perquisites. Next
day he turned up
as usual at the
roll-call, and was
promptly ejected by
the indignant
police-boy in charge
of the gaol. A few
hours later he was
back again, and
thereafter how to
get rid of him be-
came a stiff pro-
blem, especially after he had broken into the
prison three times in two days. It happened,
however, that just then there was a vacancy
for a warder, and he was presented with the
job.

“Te Babarantiko’’ on a far voyage*:—
Swains Island, the mid-Pacific dot which is about
to be officially included in Uncle Sam’s possessions,
is nine miles in circumference,;
it lies 90 miles from the
Tokelaus and 160 from Samoa.
The island belonged to a Mr.
Jennings, son of an American
father and Samoan mother,
when early in June, 1899, 1
visited the idyllic spot while
on my way to the Marshall
and Gilbert islands. It . was
understood then that Swains
was American soil; anyway,
the Stars and Stripes flew
from the flagstaff by the copra
store above the beach. The
island is densely wooded with
cocos-palms; the rim of land
encloses a lagoon so nearly
landlocked that its shallow
water is merely brackish. In
a grove of bananas and flower-
ing shrubs by the lagoon
beach, crowned by two gold-
lettered tablets, the old Ameri-
can rover and his Samoan con-
sort sleep. Except for the
calls of the old s.s. Archer
from Sydney, at long intervals,
and an occasional cutter from
Samoa, it was left alone by
the outer world. To turn the
cocoanuts into copra Mr. Jen-
nings employed a few Samoans. Incidentally,
Swains Island is undoubtedly the “Gente
Hermosa” of the early Spanish-Peruvian explorers.
Another even more remote dot over which I have
seen the American flag wave is Baker Island, a tree-
less (now worked-out) guano islet, 13 miles north of
the equator and 600 miles east of the Gilbert group.
“Old Glory’’ was hoisted by the English-Australian
Pacific Islcnds Co., which, under a lease from Ameri-
can owners, had 70 Nui boys delving for guano.

“Ex-Dig.”: Sometimes Diggers married
British women, but quite as frequently
British women married Diggers, in the
absence of any definite objections from the
prospective bridegrooms. In the Perth
Divorce Court recently there was unfolded
the tale of an Aussie who was visited in hospi-
tal by a distant feminine relative. She had
never seen him before, but a few weeks later,
when he was in camp, she applied, without the
man’s knowledge, for marriage leave for him.
Although the soldier didn’t know anything
about the proposed union, he took the leave,
and presumably the matrimonial plunge
also, knowing that if he couldn’t produce a
marriage eertilicate on his return to camp
there noiiid be trouble. This sort of thing
was not infrequent. One careless Digger of

my batt. applied, with the connivance of a
woman who, being already married, was not
really available, for the easily obtained mar-
riage leave. He overstayed it", and, to
avoid trouble —he said that he would
probably be killed, anyway, when he re-
turned "to France, so it didn’t matter mar-
ried another woman, quite casually encoun-
tered, who frankly admitted that she wanted
the cover of some man’s name, preferably a
soldier’s, for the child that was shortly to
arrive. He did die in France, and doubt-
less pensions are still being paid on his
account to his casual widow and the infant
that wasn’t his.

“FY7”: If further proof were wanted of
the Dago invasion of the North Queensland
sugar country it would be supplied by the
decision of Dr. Cumpston, Director-General
of Health, that notices and regulations m
connection with the campaign _ against hook-
worm must be printed in Italian as well as
English. The Department claims that this
is the first time its regulations have been
printed in a foreign tongue. But it was once
not unusual for some official notices in
Southern Queensland to be printed in Ger-
man. For a long time before the war the
Courier used to publish its produce market
reports in German and English; and even
after the war had started a circular m Ger-
man was issued by a South Queensland can-
didate for Parliament. The document re-
minded the recipients that the candidate was
himself of Hunnish descent, and dot blut vas
dicker dan vasser, or words to that effect.

“Chamband”: Re the Waterloo BayfS.A.)
massacre of blacks (B. 22/5/’24). I have
stood in the ruins of the hut where the
murder took place which led to such terrible
reprisals. Two brothers, returning with the
sheep towards evening, met some niggers,
who laughingly told them that they would
“find ’em plum pudding longa camp-oven.
On entering the hut they found no sign of
the hut-keeper (their father) till the lid
was lifted from the oven. There was his
freshly-severed head ! Mustering every avail-
able settler in tlie district, and armed with
rifles and shotguns, they rounded up the
blacks—some 80 or 90, I am informed by
an old settler —and the massacre began. Gut
off from retreat to the bush the natives were
forced towards the cliffs, at this point about
70ft high, and were either driven over or
shot on the edge and fell to the rocks below.
I have, at low tide, seen the crevices amongst
the boulders still carrying a fair quantity of
whitened bones, and that was 50 years after
the occurrence.
“Topee”: The Royal Navy stands for
thoroughness. Forty years ago, at artillery
sports at Victoria Barracks, Sydney, a visit-
ing Indian ofi*er gave a £5 prize for the
“best turned-out soldier.” Eliminative tests
reduced the competitors to two, both ex-
Imperial men, the one a heavily-built garri-
son gunner, the other an athletic “Blue
marine. Both men were so spotless and glittered
so dazzlingly from buttons in front to canteens
slung on belts behind that it seemed im-
possible to decide between them ; the donor of
the prize, when asked,' excused himself from
making the choice. At length an old ser-
geant-major in the crowd was invited to
adjudicate. After carefully inspecting the
candidates’ exteriors, he gave the following
orders: “Stan’ easy! Hoff belts! Display
canteens!” This being done, the arbitrator
promptly awarded the prize to the marine,
who had taken the precaution to burnish the
interior of his utensil. The gunner hadn't.

“J.H.M.A.” has his doubts:—
As I write this from a hospital bed, the garrulous
old humbug on my left continues to pour forth his
occasionally amazing reminiscences .of early Sydney.
Though I am convinced that he possesses the eminent
characteristic of many Old Inhabitants—that of a
vivid recollection of things that did not happen —
much may be gathered from him that is of genuine
historical'interest. In 1857 he was nine years oil,
and two of the red-letter days of that year were
those when his father took him to Parramatta in
the first passenger train that ran in Australia, and
when he accompanied the same indulgent parent to
look at the bodies of the victims of the Dunbar
wreck washing about in the sea at the base of the
South Head cliffs. These are probabilities; but
what I would like to be certain about is whether
he really did see drunks confined in the stocks in
York street outside the police-station which stood at
the southern end of the Old Markets built in Gover-
nor Macquarie’s time. They were, lie says, placed
on a bench at the edge of the kerbing, with their
wrists and ankles secured between the locked timbers
of the pillory, and their boots removed so that the
small boy of the period might entertain himself by
tickling the soles of their feet with straws. Were
the stocks still in use in the early ’fifties, or is
the old gentleman giving his memory more credit
than it deserves?
* * * *
“Adelaide”: S.A. Supreme Court has had
to decide a really interesting point. A
wealthy merchant of the last generation lett
his property to the widow for life, and then
to the children equally, but added a clause
not unusual in those times, that any son
becoming insolvent should forfeit his snare.
The widow lived a long time, and one of the
sons predeceased her. His estate was described
for probate as consisting of cash £5O and debts
£3OOO odd, but his expectant share in his
father’s estate was over £3OOO-odd. Ine
Court was asked to decide whether he was
insolvent or not, and has said no. He had
not committed any act of insolvency or at
any rate of bankruptcy, though the two are
much the same thing in S.A. —and so did
not forfeit his share. If. his widow (and
executrix) lias to pay creditors with it, that
is her concern, said the Court., doing sub-
stantial justice, though probably defeating
the first testator’s intention.
THE OBVIOUS WAY.
“But, dear, I can’t afford a chinchilla for
you. The hank's overdrawn."
“Well, try some other bank—they can’t ALL
be overdrawn, darling."
“210”: Paragraphs about soldiers who
were court-martialled for trying to get to
close grips with Fritz interest me; for I was
one of them. Wounded at Fleurbaix in 191 b,
I spent a period in an English hospital, mi<l
when convalescent was forwarded to a 1 er-
ham Downs depot. After enduring the hor-
rors of camp life for a few weeks I ‘bor-
rowed” an equipment and mixed myself up
with a draft proceeding to France. I got
as far as Etaples, only to be arrested, escorted
back to the Downs, court-martialled and con-
victed for (a) proceeding overseas without
permission, (b) being in unlawful possession
of an equipment which had not been issued
to me The sentence was that my seniority
be reduced by six months. The members com-
prising the court knew perfectly well that
such seniority (at any rate, so far as n.c.o. s
were concerned! didn’t matter more than

Two Points You should know about Probate!
HP AXATION to-day is heavy. Probate duty on
1 property may reach as high as 35 per cent.
Another point to remember is that some months
must elapse before Probate is granted and the
Estate made available to dependants.
Both points are covered by the P. & C. Probate
Policy. Such a policy provides for payment of
Probate Duty, thereby obviating the possibility of
a forced sale or mortgage to meet this tax.
It makes immediately available ready money to
dependants— a matter of vital importance to them.
Let us explain Probate to you—to do so is a
pleasure and places you under no obligation.

Labor in Vic. lost one of its stalwarts by
the death of Stephen Barker. His election
to the Senate for two terms was a sort of
reward for much strenuous trades-union work
—-when he was sec. of Melbourne Trades
Hall Council, he must have regarded the
“8 8 8” then emblazoned on the grass plot of
the hall as ironical, since he himself worked
about 96 hours a week. It was the dream of
bis life to get into the Senate. In 1903, when
he asked the Vic. Parliament to elect him
on the death of Yardstick Sargood, he secured
only 14 votes (all Labor). The victor on
that occasion was Robert Reid, who beat Alec
Peacock, the present Premier. Those who
smiled at the idea of Barker nominating

at all lived to see him chosen Senator twice
by the people. Especially was it gall and
wormwood to them to see him beat Swinburne
in 1022. Perhaps the Vic. Parliament at its
joint sitting on or about July 15 will put
Swinburne in if he nominates. Lawson,
ex-Premier, can have the seat if he will take
it; and Labor (perhaps with Lemmon) will
have a shot for it.
Sir Henry Kellett, the Kew (Vic.) council-
lor, who was killed in a motor accident on
Friday, only assumed his title in 1906, though
he had then been a baronet for 20 years. The
founder of the family was an English volun-
teer in the army with which William of
Orange invaded Ireland in 1690. He was re-
warded with an estate in Tipperary, and
members of the family have prospered ever
since as squires and soldiers. A Tipperary
Kellett commanded an infantry brigade in
the World War, and retired with the rank
of Major-General. Henry, the father of the
dead councillor, arrived in Australia in 1839:
he was a younger brother of the first baronet.
The heir to the title lives at Roseville, Syd-
ney, and is in Dalgety’s.
By annexing Vic. Railway Commissioner
Miscamble to run its lines, the Speck is get-
ting even for the loss of Charles Hudson 21
years ago. Irvine and Bent induced Hud-
son to migrate from Hobart in 1903 to
become third commissioner at the time
Thomas Tait, of Canada, and W. F. Fitz-
patrick, of Vic. Railway Department, were
made the “strong” triumvirate to take charge
after the loco, men’s strike. Miscamble is the
Vic. Department’s cabin-boy-to-Admiral illus-
tration, as he joined as a train-door slammer.
Why he should, at 62, cross over to the
little island for an extra fiver a week is not
easy to understand. Perhaps he thinks he
can do big things. And he may.
“0.P.H.”: It was 18 years on June 10
since Dick Seddon died while voyaging back
to Wellington from Australia. I met him
down the bay, off Williamstown, the morn-
ing he came to Melbourne on that last visit,
and I recollect that he gave the go-by to mayors
and others in order to oblige me with a hur-
ried interview. That was the time he de-
scribed himself as a
humanist in politics. A
humanist, he explained,
was something more
than a Radical
Liberal, and better
than a Laborite. In
his hurry Seddon an-
nexed my umbrella,
but I regained it,
quite as uncere-
moniously, after he
had given it an air-
ing in Adelaide. He
was the best visiting
big-gun for copy I
have ever handled.
Incidentally, he forced
me to have a late
breakfast with him
one morning I went to
see him.. “No break-
fast, no interview,” he
said, and so I had
both.

tion for old members of the Light Horse. In
the Reps, are General Ryrie and Col. Cam-
and the Senate lias Generals Glasgow
and Cox. Col. Bruxner, leader of the Ma
State Progressives, was a squadron leader in
Palestine, and Col. Bourchier, who handled
the 12th A.L.H. there, is a rising voice in
the Vic. Country party. One of his old
squadron-leaders, Major Chanter, son of the
former Chairman of Committees in the Reps.,
is trying to capture Rodney in to-day’s elec-
tions in Vic. Cr. Neale, who is having a
shot for Albert Park, also had a mount in
the A.L.H., but later transferred to the artil-
lery. It was this Neale who polled 7000
votes against the impregnable Jimmy Mat-
thews for the Melbourne Ports seat at the
last Federal elections.
Catherine Barker Colyer, who went out
at 91 recently, was the oldest native-born
resident of the northern districts of
N.S.W. A daughter "of that Edward Peter
Capper who established the first ironmongery
business in West Maitland nearly 90 years
ago, she never changed her ‘ place of
abode. When she married Parson Colyer
they established the original C. of E. Gram-
mar School in West Maitland, and that was
over 60 years ago.
Adelaide ’Varsity, following its practice of
choosing professors from young Australians

Melbourne Grammar and the Uni., held a
lecturership in Westralia for two years, was
given the special Rhodes Scholarship in 1922,
and after a brief brilliant run at Oxford was
offered a fellowship at All Souls’. His Adel-
aide engagement allows him to remain at
Oxford till the end of next year, specialising
in his future Australian work.
“Uramao”: Henry Rayne, author of “The
Ivory Raiders,” reviewed in a recent Bulle-
tin, fired the last shot on the British side in
the Boer War. Rayne, who is a native of
Otago (M.L.), was a lieutenant in the
N.Z.M.R., and two days after the fight was
declared off lie and another officer, while out
hunting, were bailed up by three Boers igno-
rant of the “Cease fire.” They were in rags,
and ordered the officers to disrobe. As the
latter had left their rifles near their horses a
little distance away, they started to comply;
but while Bayne was kicking off his nether
garments he seized his pistol, which con-
tained only three cartridges, and shot two of
the Boers dead and wounded the third. The
wounded Dopper fired, killing the other officer
and wounding Bayne, who hobbled back to
camp.
J. C. B. Moncrieff, dead in Adelaide at 75,

when Minister for Public Works in 1910
discovered J. C. Bradfield, the engineer who
has come into world prominence over the
North Shore Bridge. He found him an
assistant-engineer in the drafting-room of the
Railway Construction Branch on £4OO per
annum, made him Engineer of North Shore
Bridge and Metropolitan Railway Construc-
tion, and raised his salary to £lOOO in one

Another romance of business was touched
when the palatial new premises of the Mick
Simmons firm in the Haymarket, Sydney
were opened a few days ago. Half a cen-
tury back, when the original Mick was 21,
he started business as a tobacconist in a
shop 12ft. x 12ft., his capital being a bor-
rowed fiver. A name which suggested a
sport was additional capital when he began
to specialise in sporting requisites. Michael
himself is under the sod. but three sons were

Lemmon, sec. of the Vic Labor party, is
credited with getting a letter from his son,
an agricultural college student, congratulat-
lng him on the Williamstown walk-over, and
adding that the saving in exes, ought to
bring nearer to materialisation that bike
you sort of promised me.” That’s what
comes of being reared in a political atmo-
sphere.

since been transformed into the town of
Kilcoy. In April William was born, and the
night of his arrival was the one chosen by the
blacks to attack the 18 white people who
comprised the population. The settlers
sought to hold off the assault by firing through
loop-holes in the walls of their slab huts •
but although many blacks were killed it
looked as though they would be overcome bv
superior numbers, until Fraser senior seized
his bagpipes from the wall, and, striking' up

to the formation of the Political Labor

his own account; and at a recent election
became president of the Boot, Shoe and

“Who loves not wine and women and song
Is a blinkin’ mug,” said Martin Luther —
His version, p’raps, was not so strong,
And mine may read a bit uncouther.
But note this wight of simpler mind,
All he desires, from A to Z,
Is here explicitly defined:
“A dog, a bottle and a bed.”
Above all friends a dog is true;
His is a faith no fear can throttle.
When elsewhere all is bleak arid blue,
There’s golden sunshine in the bottle.
No guide he needs who doth engage
The midnight’s darkling maze to thread
So he command this appanage,
“A dog, a bottle and a bed.”
Let others seek beneath the bough
To waste their time with vamps and verses,
While some find paradise enow
In slitting throats or picking purses.
Far happier he who asks no more
Of life, when all is done and said,
But just of goods this simple store,
A dog, a bottle and a bed.
Blown to a bubble is the game
That turns by every trick to women,
And what is gold, or might, or fame
To him whose natural acumen
Sees through the pinchbeck of their lure,
And ere th’ appointed span is sped,
On these things only builds secure:
A dog, a bottle and a bed!

“Wee Bobbie”: “Bouragi” (B. 5/6/’24) is
right when he denies intentional cruelty in the
Papuan, and this applies to all the South Sea
natives with whom I am acquainted. In 20 years,
on and off, among them I have never known of one
case of deliberate cruelty. That they are aware of
what unpleasant things could be done to a prisoner
1 have no doubt. I have heard natives say in places
where mosquitoes are bad, “My w'ord, suppose you
tieum up man here, moskit make him savvy.” The
same remark I have heard regarding antbeds; nut
l have never known any of such things to be done.
To illustrate the mentality of the native in regard
to cruelty let me quote an incident. I took charge
of a plantation some years ago, and cn going through
the cattle found three suffering from tuberculosis, and
decided to shoot them. The stock-boy followed me
round with an axe ready to heap a fire on them and
burn the carcases. I dropped the three of them with
SEEMED EASY TO HIM.
"Don't forget what I’ve told you; and, above all things, mind you
keep mum."
“Keep mum! Who d'yer think 'd want ter take ’er away?"
tmllets in the brain. Coming back later I asked
the stock-boy if he had burned all the bullamacows.
“Yes, master,” he said, “me burn him; but one
fella sing out too much when fire he catch him.”
“Did you hit him alonga head and kill him?” I
asked. “No, me no hit him along akis; him he
can’t get up,” he said simply. I raced to the fire
and found the unfortunate animal still alive and
soon put it out of misery. Had I had less experien le
that native would have got the thrashing of his life,
but I knew that the bellowing of the animal meant
no more to him than the crackling of a living tree
toppled in the fire. It was therefore quite sufficient
that the animal couldn’t get up, and must be burned
presently.
“Troop Horse”: The name Ant Cliffs was
given to a landmark on Melville Island (N.T.) by
Captain J. L. Stokes, of H.M.S. Beagle, in June,
1339. At that place Stokes sent a party ashore to
take observations. They picked upon some cliffs
suitable for the purpose, and one officer, wishing
to get a better view of the locality, climbed a tree.
In doing so he burst a green-ants’ nest and spilled
the indignant contents over himself and his brother-
officers beneath. Then he fell out of the tree, carry-
ing an extra supply of ants with him, and in a few
moments the whole party had tom off its clothes
and was jumping around in a state of nature trying
,to get rid of the ferocious little devils. The green-
ant is a sticker; his bite is red-hot, and the only
way the men could relieve themselves was by get-
ting in a ring and picking off the ants singly. The
performance seen from the ship greatly tickled Cap-
tain Stokes, who thereupon gave the place the name
it bears.

“Larry Longun”: “H.V.E.” says the
spoonbill is apparently not gregarious in habit and
usually appears singly or at most in odd couples (B.
8/5/’24). As a boy in the inland parts of S. Queens-
land I remember seeing, time rnd again, flocks of 50
and upwards of these fine birds feeding in a lucerne
patch in a flat more than a mile from the nearest
water and close to the main road. They usually
camped at night in the tops of the dry gums in the
neighboring swamps, which, in those days, teemed
with aquatic wild fowl of all descriptions.
“Ento”: “Billy the Bird” (B. 29/5/’24)
need not have flown as far as Samoa in order 1,0
alight upon an expert hunter of household flies in die
form of a small grey spider, because a similar
Arachnid (Diana) is in Queensland. During the
last couple of years I have been amused by the
antics of this chap around the blowflies which l
have been holding for research purposes. It tries to
catch them from the outside of a glass conta'n.-r
in which the flies are kept captive. Has “Billy”
ever noticed about his Samoan pets an astonishing
capacity for jumping off a vertical pane of glass ami
landing one or two inches away in a horizontal line?
When doing this they neither rise nar fall —defying
gravity they leave the upright glass and return to it
again without dropping. While watching the per-
formance around the convex side of a glass bottle 1
solved the mystery of this action, and with it why
the spiders, when stalking on a vertical plane, seldom
pounce upon their prey other then in a horizontal
direction. Has any Abo. witnessed the drama on a
ceiling? A jumping spider seems to hunt there
sometimes with success, but I have never had the
good fortune to be in at the catch.

“Chhota Peg”: On two occasions lately I
have seen friend kookaburra sitting on a fence near
Maffra (Vic.), carefully battering the life out of a
fluttering starling; and a few days ago I saw a
couple of magpies vigorously attacking a starling on
the ground. Which makes me wonder whether a
racial war has broken out. Incidentally, does
Maggie make a habit of slaughtering smaller birdß
for the family stewpan ?

. “Ragar” : Reverting to luminous fungi, I
discovered a light biscuit-colored mass growing on
the base of a semi-rotten tree stump in the bottom
of a gully behind Beacon , Hill, near Brook vale
(N.S.W.). The stuff looked so like the edible species
fehat I tried it by smell and taste. It was slightly
bitter and hot to the
tongue, with a faintly
sour scent. I was
camped beside a small
stream, and found the
fungus while searching
for dead wood for the
fire. After dark my
attention was drawn to
a light some distance
from the camp. I
went over to investi-
gate, and found that it
was the same mass of
fungus, brightly lumi-
nous, the light glowing
strongly on the under-
side, and more faintly
through the surface
skin, as though from
a light within. I de-
tached the entire mass,
and on weighing it
found that it was over
71b. The light was
strong enough to en-
able me to see the
time when the watch
was held close to it,
and large print was
readable also. This is
the second variety <f
luminous fungi I have
found in the hills close
to Sydney. The first
was a creamy-grey v also growing from rotting wood,
and the light was distinctly green, whereas that of the
second was white. Can any Abo. mycologist say
whether there are any edible species among the
luminous fungi of N.S.W. ?

“ J.C.”: “Gouger’s” par. about his feline-
sighted mate (B. 15/5/’24) is interesting, but 1 would
like to know whether his sight was of the best in
daylight. If he could t see distinctly at 300yds.
on a dark night, his retina must have been unusu-
ally sensitive ; but this very fact would have caused
him a good deal of pain in strong light. The phos-
phorescence seems to have been incidentalto his keen
sight, and not the cause of it. A cat’s eyes shine
in the dark merely by virtue of stray light reflected
from the retina, and colored by passage through the
sclerotic. A dog’s eyes flame in a similar manner, and
in favorable circumstances a human being’s eyes will
glow, not with the usual yellowish-green of phospho-
rescence, but redly. The color is due merely to light
reflected from the red blood-vessels of the retina. In
a dark-eved person a large proportion of the reflected
light is absorbed by the pigment of the eve, so that
the effect is not readily seen; but a blue-eyed subject
will nearly always show it, and albinos almost invari-
ably have pink eyes, since they are entirely devoid

of any pigment. Perhaps “Gouger’s” mate was cor-
rect in describing his faculty, as a. curse, for some
bacteria (notably putrefactive bacteria) are phos-
phorescent, so that the phosphorescence in his case
may have been due to some organic disorder.
* * •# * .
“Morob”: “H.L.S.’s” story of how a blacks’
camp was scared into thinking that devils were about
at night (B. 5/6/’24) reminds one that in practically
all parts of New Guinea the natives believe that the
“tamarangs” or evil spirits come out as soon as it is
dark, and are constantly on the watch for stray nig-
gers. Fortunately, however, the devils are quite un-
able to pass fire at night, so a village is protected
by a ring of small fires about it. Sometimes the fires
are placed in a circle around the settlement, and
sometimes just four are made, one at each corner of
the place. Inside this protective belt the nigger has
no fear whatever of the “tamarangs” ; but, in the case
of the bush-natives especially, all the tinned meat
and jew’s-harps in New Guinea would not tempt him
outside it before dawn in districts known to be
afflicted with devils.
“Colub”: It is difficult to realise how the
mud which “Gagi’s” black gin ate (B. 22/5/’2l)
could be any good as a snakebite cure. Though
it might be possible: to administer a real antidote
per the mouth, a substance like mud could not be
absorbed through the stomach and into the blood,
which it, would have to reach before it could neu-
tralise the snake-venom.
* * * *
“Colub”: I cannot say whether “J.G.’s”
eels died from heart-failure or from the bite of the
black snake that was, in the can with them (B.
6;'6/’24) ; but if the snake had. bitten them deeply

LADY OF THE LIMOUSINE : “Look, Alfred. The
poor, degraded creature!' Did you ever

sign of refinement?”
enough to get some of their blood into his own sys-
tern, the reptile would himself have died. The blood
of the eel contains a body which is extremely toxic
more so, comparatively, than is the venom of poison-
ous snakes—and, although next to nothing is known
concerning its chemical structure, it is believed to be
allied with the animal venoms. Experiments have
shown that an extremely minute dose of eels’ blood
may be fatal when injected into the vascular system
of other creatures, its action resembling that of the
colubrine venoms, and the snake does not possess
any immunity to it, as it does in the case of a
number of the animal venoms. Unlike nearly all
the rest of the venoms, which are practically
harmless unless they be introduced directly into the
blood, this body is able to exert its toxic action
\vhen taken into the stomach, and has even caused
death in such circumstances. It is easily destroyed
by heat, fortunately, which is the reason why cooked
eels can be eaten with safety.

thing so much as a lively wrestling bout, with much

scratching when the contestants were down on the
ground. The rattle of'their strong-nailed toes over

“Wax”: Tell “J.A.” (B. 5/6/’24) that
the other two bees did not come to rescue their mate
who was caught in a spider-web, but to deal out
stoush to whoever or whatever was hurting her. When
a bee is annoyed—“gets her sting out,” so to speak—
she emits a peculiar odor which acts as a battle-call
to her mates. The breaking of the web was purelv
accidental. Bees may often be seen attacking wood-
swallows who have been dining on their relations,
the attack being caused by the above-mentioned odor
clinging to the birds’ beaks.

mammoth murphies recall a number of whoppers
grown by a relative of mine on the North Coast,
Bananaland, in 1904. The “sweet bucks,” which
were of the snow-queen variety (one of the best
sweet potatoes grown), ranged from 61b. to a shade
under 301 b., and were sound and of good quality. A
peculiarity about the crop was that there was
scarcely any vine, which caused my relative to think
the spuds were a failure till the bandicoots disclosed
what was beneath. On the same farm (light vol-
ernic. scrub land) about three years ago a root of
26 potatoes was lifted, one of the murphies measur-
ing 22in. in length.

“Bob Sawyer”: Queer bush accidents?
Fifteen years ago a farmer brought his six-year-old
daughter to the surgery. He had found her lying
dazed in the mud. She
had a broken nose,
contused eyes and
lacerated face, and it
was some days later
that we heard her story.
She had gone out into
the road to watch for
her father, and, seeing
a big horseshoe on the
ground, remembeivd
that if you spat on
one and threw it over
your left shoulder and
wished, etc. It was
too muddy to handle,
so she stooped, put her
pinny over it, and
picked it up. The
protruding nails must
have caught in her
garment, because, whe.i
she heaved the chunk
of ironmongery, in-
stead of going over
her shoulder it struck
the poor kid squarely
in the face. Last
Easter, while I was in
Sydney on a ferry, a
lady looked at me a
while and then spoke to me. It was our child-
“fueky’hoTseThoeT 6 b ° re permanent reeord her
“W. 8.” (M.L.) : “B.” wants to know (B.
15/5/’24) what flavor a fish diet would give pork.
Let me tell him. Something- between whale-oil and
pcfijk. In the early trading days my father bought
a lot of Maori pigs, and one day when a shoal of
trevally covered about half a mile of our beach, the
Old Man, thinking these would be good fattening,
sent us boys with dray and shovels to cart the
manna home. Result: The flesh of the porkers—
even after leaving the smoke-house—could be neither
sold nor eaten. The same thing- will happen with
pigs fed on seaweed, kelp-maggots or san ljumpers;
so also with ducks and their eggs if the birds have
fed on kelp-maggots, etc. In fact, its true of all
animals that have lived on seafoods of whatever sort,
except scaled fish and conger eels. Gulls’ eggs inherit
their special and (to some) offensive taste from
their trainoil-flavored mammas. These are steel-
shod facts, and the moral for “B.” to paste in
his hat is: Don’t feed pigs on fish if you want to
feed on the pigs.
* * * *
“AdeL” (N.T.) : Odd miners who have
made their homes at some of the
springs up here, south and west
of the Lawn Hill silver-lead field,
have been at war with the black-
headed python ever since they
started to biyed chickens. Bat-
talions of these squirmers are
entrenched in the rocky gorges
whence the springs are flowing,
and although none have been seen
over 10ft. in length many have a
girth of 20in., which gives them a
formidable appearance. They are
game fighters and cunning thieves
with a sweet tooth for poultry.
Now another of the crawling tribe,
a monster pale-green water-snake,
fully 20tft. long, has joined the
pythons as a poultry marauder.
A boundary-rider on the Queens-
land-Northern Territory border-
fence, which runs through this
locality, put up a 12ft. netting-
fence, and twisted several rounds
of barbed-wire round the base of
the bohinia-tree on which bis
chooks roosted, but at regular in-
tervals a bird disappeared. At
last, hearing a commotion in the
fowlyard, he sallied forth in the
moonlight with his gun, and found
a huge green snake lazily going
over the fence. He shot it, and
a post-mortem revealed the
victim of the night safely
pouched in its tummy. This
specimen taped 21ft., and be-
longed to a species of water-
snake often seen in deep pools
amid the hills in this locality.
What does the Council know of
these gentry?
A weighty matter:—
“Harvib”: Toll “Trevdee” (B. 29/5/’24) that F.
Bull, of Waddington (M.L.), recently sold through
the Addington markets a pen of wethers at £l4
10s. that averaged 2091 b. butchers’ weight.
“U.P.”: I remember that some years ago, at the
Pinjarra (W.A.) Show, a sheep was on view which
weighed 3061 b. This was a Border Leicester, and
some of the same breed sealed 2151 b. dressed.
“Patiti”: “Trevdee’s” wether which fetched £4 7s.
for its dead weight of 1901 b. may hav'e been the
heaviest sheep ever killed for mutton, but the other
day, in Maoriland, £3-odd was given for a jumbuck’s
overcoat, and as nothing was said about the carcase,
it was most likely sold as that of a bullock.
“Hopalong” : Re “Billy the Bird’s” hunt-
ing spiders (B. 29/5/’24). I back the little black
Queensland house spider as a destroyer of flies. Al-
though he does not actually spin a trap web, he
uses a single strand with great dexterity. His
method is to edge up to within about 6in. of a fly
and fasten down the end of a single strand of web.
He then sidles off at right angles for about 9in.,
after which he moves round the circumference of a
circle with the strand as radius, until it touches the
fly, and before the latter has time to free itself it
is pounced upon.
“Gecko”: Unlike “Fordson” (B. 29/5/’24)
I have not been introduced to a one-eyed jew-fish, but
I have extracted the sightless eyeball from the socket
of a frowsy frog-mouth (Podargus strig aides). That
freakish orb (in life) resembled a green, glassy,
bottle-o marble, while the other optic was perfectly’
normal. As freaks in blue-blood wild life are ex-
ceptionally rare, allow me to throw in a frog with
five legs as a draw line. The fifth limb (fully
equipped with bones) hung loosely from the wish-
bone.
* * * ,
“Perdix” : Apropos the discussion as to
the unintentional cruelty of the Papuan savage to-
wards animals, you’ll find here and there exactly
the same mental quality among white people. At
Ulverstone (Tas.) the other day a man pleaded guilty
to a charge of cruelty to animals, he having sent
by rail a bag containing a number of live rabbits,
each with one or two legs broken. They were
destined for west coast mining towns, at least 36
hours’ distant, and this method of forwarding was
adopted in order to ensure their arriving in “good
condition.’’ The practice, it was admitted, had
been in vogue for some considerable time. The
Bench imposed a fine of £2 with 10s. costs, and
intimated that should there be a similar case in
the future the sentence would be imprisonment with-
out the option. Incidentally, this was the first case
in the Speck to come under the heading of “Cruelty
to Wild Animals.”
* * * *
“Ragar”: A recent storm disturbed the
winter sleep of at least one black snake. He was
camped in the tube of an ancient gumtree when the
w’ind snapped it off at that point where the hollow
had been filled in by white-ants, earth and other
fairly solid matter—the bed on- which the snake
slept. In breaking the tree had in some way
gripped part of him and held him prisoner, about sft.
of the head end hanging outside, and about a couple
of feet being still on the tree stump. I went fairly
close up to examine the situation, when his nibs sud-
denly showed me he was neither dead nor asleep by an
attempt to reach me. Whether he’d have remained
awake until he had starved to death, or would have
gone to sleep again, I’m not prepared to say ; but, in
case some other stiekybeak went investigating, as I
did, I finished him with a waddy. It’s the first time
I ve known a snake, whether prisoner or not, to be
sufficiently awake at this time of the year to attempt
an attack on anyone.
a y* * * *
“Windie”: The local wiseacres are scratch-
ing their heads over a curious phenomenon which has
presented itself at a spot in the Tower Hill Lake, near
Koroit (Vic.). Many years ago, when an attempt was
being made to construct a gravel-track across the
swampy portion of the lake-bed, to the island in the
centre, the work was held up because no amount of
gravel would fill up a waterhole in the course of the
proposed track. It is estimated that between 50
and 60 tons of gravel were poured into this hole
without any effect whatsoever. Like a quicksand, the
spongy bottom absorbed load after load, which disap-
peared at once. Yet during Hit recent dry season
that same waterhole dried up and revealed a surface
underneath as hard as a rock. And now, when
rain has again fallen, the same quagmire effect has
returned.
Li] y Beale”: Some bushmen have a trick
of tying a bag to a stick and letting a snake strike
it several times. The bag absorbs the poison and
t le wriggler can then be picked up with impunity,
as half an hour will elapse before there is any
chance of any further venom being secreted in the
glands. An old abo., Gingie Charlie, well known in
the Brewarrina and Walgett (N.S.W.) district, used
to do this for driilks at the Boorooma pub. I have
seen him let a black snake coil around his neck after
playing it with the bag for a few minutes. He would
then give a yell, gammoning he had been bitten, and
appeal with a whine; “Gibbit rum longa poor
Charlie, boss.”
“Bung”; At Bywong (N.S.W.) recently,
after a wet night, two teams, turning out for an
appointed tehnis-mateh, found their courts partly
under water. It seemed as though, the game would
have to be abandoned, until a genius among the
players appeared. Bringing a tin of benzine from
his car, he added it to the unwelcome moisture
and applied a light. In less than half an hour
the grounds were dry enough for play. There
is a theory that that is how the waters of the Bed
bea were divided on a historical occasion. Some-
body merely poured a line of kerosene across it and
set it afire.
* * • *
Some serpentine co-re’s:—
“Jimmy Possum”: “Colub” (B. l/5/’24) not-
withstanding “H.V.E.” is right when he says a
black and a browm snake will sometimes mate. An
indisputable instance of this cross-loving occurred on
the North Coast (Q.), the pair being despatched in
flagrante delicto. There could be no mistake about
the species, as the lady was of the red-bellied type
of black, and the Don Juan was unmistakably brown
—and their executioners were bushmen who knew
both species well. I have seen and also killed several
melamstic specimens of the brown snake: but I
never suspected them of being anything other than
what they were, despite the darkness of color. The
heads of the brown and black species are so dis-
similar that only the most careless observer could
tail to distinguish them.
‘ V.C.J.’’: I have seen a cobra mate with a rat-
snake. The latter is the same color as the
cobra, but more elongated, non-venomous and hood-
less. -Such mating is so common that the Cinga-
lese m some localities believe the rat-snake to be
the female cobra. That this is not the case is
proved by the fact that a community of cobras may
be observed with none resembling rat-snakes among
them. Incidentally-, I once had a large chow dog
mu” by ?■ c °bra, which he had amateurishlv tackled,
lhe poor brute, which was probably bitten in severai
places, suffered more agony than I have ever known
OUTWARD BOUND.
“Look at that for scenery! Ain’t it bosker?
I better ’ave another afore th ’ effect
wears of."
either dog or human go through from snakebite.
The chief cause of pain appeared to be a bite in
one of his forepaws, in which a fang remained em-
bedded. This wound the dog continually bit at
and licked until just before death. The blood flowed
freely most of the time, which is, I think, unusual
The snake had been domiciled with another in a
teimites nest in a rubber field, and for some days
after this the coolies were unable to tap the trees
in the vicinity, as the mate of the dead snake came
out and gave chase if they ventured too near It
was eventually killed.
DINNY MURPHY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In forest depths, where no one comes,
There is a clearing in the gums,
A straggling farm, a patch of maize:
Here Dinny Murphy spends his days
Alone with Nature’s startled brood,
A queer old man, in solitude,
V ithout a wife or child or friend,
Content to battle to the end.
For thirty years he’s lived alone,
A frontiersman who holds his own
Against the bush. He still can ride,
Fence, plough and keep his hut with pride.
He s always on the move ; no cares
But illness brought his first grey hairs.
“I’m just a young chap yet,” says he,
Though Dinny owns to seventy-three.
Around him is a silent scene
As though man there had never been
Mountain and bush; no town nor mart
Where Dinny Murphy plays his part.
He sees the dewdrops on the grass,
The blazing noon, the shadows pass ;
And when night falls, worn out with toil
He sits and sees his billy boil.
Great trees sweep round him far and wide—
It’s hard to clear that mountain-side.
He has a grudge against those trees
And kangaroos and wallabies.
Sometimes an old-man kangaroo
Breaks down his fences, crashing through.
But Dinny’s ready for the job;
“I’ll fix it now,” he says, “be gob!” .
His wife is dead, he has no child.
Yet still he struggles with the wild,
Faces bush fire and flood and drought
To shift man’s outpost farther out.
For this he leaves the settled ways,
For this he spends his dwindling days,
The pride and glory of the strife—
This is the faith that thrills his life.
For Dinny is the only man
Between the valley of the Cann
And Ginoa farms. He means to hold
His patch of land, now green and gold.
For though the work is never done,
He feels his fight is nearly won.
Fie holds the fort. The rest have gone ;
But Dinny Murphy battles on.
VICTORIA.
LOUIS ESSON.

LETTER
SAY-

SILK GLOVES
Those who were in the vestibule of Her
Majesty’s on Saturday night when the vice-
regals arrived had the joy of noting a George
Rambert entrance. His leap up the steps of
the theatre was timed to the second : the
limelight for the just-arrived Government
House parties was still turned on full. In
fact, the kiss that Mrs. Pitt Rivers quarter-
way up to. the dress-circle blew down had for
a dizzying moment the look of being flung
at George’s bald patch, though it was really
intended for Mrs. George Armstrong, who, in
a wonderful ermine coat, languidly toyed
with a three-foot flame-feather fan, rather
with the air of one who has from infancy
played with G.-G.’s and such.
Bady Forster and the State vice-reine were
magnificent, the first covering black and gold
brocades with a luxurious black fur coat,
and topping the lot with a diamond tiara.
Bady de Chair shone like a sapphire under
a regal cape that might have been beaten
gold; and Mrs. Pitt Rivers was folded in
tender pinks and blues, a white fur collar
finishing off her blue cloak. Dord Forster
apd Sir Dudley, aides Coote and Eawrence
and the nice Commander Grant couple
were in the party. They were shep-
herded into a golden poinsettia-blooming re-
serve in the middle of the dress-circle. The
Tony Hordern box, on the right, and the
E. J. Taits’, on the left, were beautified in
the same way.
In the stalls sat Borgioli’s wife (she was
Patricia Mort, of Sydney), very smart. The
Taits’ party included nightingale Toti, her
pretty plumpness enfolded in gold brocade
and ermine, diamonds like dewdrops winking
in her hair; the beauteous Scavizzi; and
others of the warblers. The hostess wore
diamonds and black velvets. It was from
Toti the first bouquet was thrown at the
feet of Melba, and after that at each cur-
tain the frozen poet and his friends got
warmed up . gathering in the horticulture
when they weren’t playing Nuts in May,
taking calls with Dame Nellie. Other first-
nighters were the Earle Pages, the Mayoral
couple, the John Bemmones, Arthur Allens
and everybody in (or nearly in) Sydney’s
Who’s Who.
From the silk-calved, powder-wigged and
gold-braided personage on the steps of Her
Majesty’s, it was purple and gold all the
way to the dress-circle. Grand opera had
come to Sydney, and the Firm had responded
with new upholsterings of royal gold and
purple in the lounge and at the entrance to
the circle. Gorgeous new shades sprayed
soft rays of light on a glowing parade of
evening wraps. Silver, gold, ermine; em-
broidered tissues proud with peacocks’ hues;
shawls from Spain, the Indies and the Near
and Farther East; and in each snuggled a
fair or unfair, whose head flew a shingle,
glittered with a jewel-spangled bandeau, or
occasionally effulged with diamonds. Mrs.
Thornett’s shawl was one of the evening’s
eye-arresters; another was Miss O’Keefe’s
gold cape, bolster-collared to the eyebrows.
When Melba walked to the front of the
Tony Hordern box on Monday night there
was a storm of handclaps from the big audi-
ence waiting to hear the new soprano in the
part wherein Dame Nellie first revealed the
unrivalled purity of her own notes. In
Persian blue georgettes, with an opera season
or two in diamonds on her head, Melba took
her mead of praise, and then sat in company
with Mrs. Pat Osborne, Mrs. Pitt Rivers and
Captain Lawrence. The two sets of vice-
regals were again present, Lady Forster
cloaked in bronze, and our own Viking's
lady in stately black with pearls and dia-
monds to cheer up the effect. By-and-bye
Dal Monte blew kisses to Melba and her
sister-warblers; and then emptied half her
flower-show over on the orchestra, the flaut-
ist getting a special buttonhole.
Shawls from far Kashmir, the Indies and
Spain flung their rainbow brightness over the
Wentworth the other night when the animals’
friends disported themselves in honor of
Waterloo, and to swell the exchequer of the
S.P.C.A. They were worn swathed after the
style of the Spanish dancer’s, they were cross-
overs, they were draped. They were Paisley,
silk crepe, embroidered and painted. They
were such as might have been worn at the
ball where “Bright lights shone on bare
women.” The attic and the family chest had
been ransacked for grandma’s and great-
grandmamma’s treasures, and the Wentworth
was brilliant with their colors, and so im-
pregnated with the tenderness of their mem-
ories that the old-fashioned waltz competition
made the hit of the evening—Binns Rabett
who was (she is Mrs. Turle, of India, now)
won it, partnered by brother Bob. The Gov-
ernor and his lady, who did not arrive till
after dinner, were guarded by aide Coote, and
welcomed by Miss Eadith Walker, whose
black silk cr£pe shawl was appropriately em-
blazoned with dog roses. Bady de Chair’s
beautiful claret-hued shawl had belonged to
Sir Harry Rawson’s mother. Sweet Nell,
herself enfolded in a square of rich Canton
cr@pe, weighed the merits of the different
heirlooms, and finally added up in favor of
Mrs. Rose’s Spanish shawl, rich in fringe
entanglements. Dorothea Collins, the Bang-
tree girls and Judith Jenkins were among
the dancers, and the Colonel Cox-Taylors and
the George Earps added military and consular
support. Mrs. Bayly Macarthur and Mrs.
Evelyn Andrews organised the flutter. And
if the frost keeps up, other popular nights
should be the Fur Coat Hop and the Radiator
Ball.
One of the nicest parties of the week was
given to Eadith Walker by the Red Cross
and some of her Digger friends at Rose Hall
on Saturday afternoon. Miss AValker, in un-
obtrusive grey, blushed rosy red when for
once she simply had to listen to what others
thought of her. Knight William Vicars, for
instance, considered her a mixture of Joan
of Arc and Florence Nightingale, and a
combination of man’s brain and woman’s
heart. Bady Forster presided and Chief Jus-
tice Cullen’s lady added her gentle looks to
a group that included Gladys Owen and Mrs.
Johnstone. Capable and enthusiastic Mrs.
James Ashton organised the party, and Mrs.
Marie Irvine and Alice Friend, both in their
V.A. regimentals, saw that the billy boiled.
St. Paul’s within the Uni. held its jolly
yearly dance last week, and in spite of the
icy edge to the night stuck to the time-
honored custom of jazzing in a marquee
erected in the grounds. This was hung around
with Christmas-like festoons of greenery
which burst into pink blooming, and baskets
spilling over with crimson roses and autumn
leaves helped the decorative scheme. Warden
Garnsey and his lady did the honors, she in
satin frocking that held the tone of a la
France rose, and was embellished with a
train of black Spanish lace. The common-
room was cosy with shaded lights and fire-
glow, and even a wallflower couldn’t feel out
in the cold. Representatives of all the other
Uni. colleges were among the nearly 400
gitests.
This clever head belongs to the matron of
the new cancer home at Ryde, which by the
grace of God
in the heart of
knight Hugh
Dixson has
been made
ready for open-
ing this after-
noon by Sir
Dudley de
Chair. T li e
matron, who
hails from
Bowral, has

tal, and during

The movie world turned out in the bitter
chill of last Thursday in a concerted effort
to keep the wolf from the doors of the Child-
ren’s Hospital and the old-established Crown-
street Hospital for Women. Of course, there
were other ingredients in the m@lee, but they
were rather in the proportion of the currants
in the bun. By 8.30 the new arrival could
scarcely step without treading on a Cossack
or a Mack Sennett bathing-girl, or bumping
into Sheiks and Toreadors. There were
young things as satin-brocaded princelets dis-
playing figures planned more or less on Ein-
stein lines. There were modern Eves with
nothing to keep the breezes off between the
line where the jazz trunks ended and the
socks began. A group of crimson-clad
girleens, Cossack-booted and white-furred,
came from “Where the North Begins” ; and
a pearl-shell large enough to have a bath in
made an impressive entry, enclosing the Sim-
plex twins. The Beau Brummel party in-
clued the Beau himself, the fleshly Prince
of Wales of those days, the poet Byron and
Admiral Byng. Secretary Bouis Brown
came as himself, and co-worker E. A. Jones
disguised as a coy pierrot guarded the vice-
regal bouquet till it was time for Stuart
Doyle’s wife to pass it to Bady Forster. The
vice-reine flew Borelei green brocaded in
silver that drew a shimmer of silver lace in
its train, and Mrs. Doyle flung a glowing
Javanese shawl over shell-pink sleekness.
Dr. Clubbe and his wife came, she in golden
brown brocades ; the Waley lady was in Dutch
blue georgettes, weighted with coral embroid-
eries ; and Mrs. R. M. Sly. in grey frock-
ing, held the brief for the Crown-street
Women’s Hospital.
The prettiest evening wedding of the week
was blessed by Canon Bellingham at St.
Philip’s. The girl of the hour was Bella
Haines, only chick of the Haineses of Har-
lowe, Cooma; and the young man in the case
was Roy Russell-Jones, of Bowral. The
bride and her maids chose sheath frocks with
the new circular frill below the knees; Bella’s
was carried out in the orthodox ivory satin
and tulle; while cousin Myra and ’groom's
sister Pete wore chiffon velvet in cyclamen
and powder-blue tones. Bater the bride s
father and mother held a reception 200 strong
at the Wentworth.
The remarkable girl in this picture is Vera
Bedford, daughter of writer Randolph, whose
name is known
in three conti-
nents. Before
her marriage
Vera was one
of the best-
known figures
in the Sydney
Cons ervator-
ium world. She
allies a big
singing voice
to sound
m u sieianship,
and is a small-
part player in
the present
Grand Opera
com bination.
She has that
rare quality in
singers in
fact, among
actresses gen-
erally—a fine
sense of comedy. Her Martha in “Faust”
is a clever piece of work.
Another job for Canon Bellingham was
provided by Marjorie Rutledge, of North
Sydney, and Dr. Stanley, of Gunnedah, heir
of tne medical Stanleys of Tamworth. Maro-
cain as blue as lobelias clothed the bride;
and bridesmaids Rosalind Stanley’s frocking
was a symphony in autumn tones. Mar-
jorie’s mother spread the feast at Farmer’s.
At St. John’s in Darlingliurst on Satur-
day evening pretty Lynda Quinn,_ of Coogee,
was linked up with Harry Perdriau —son of
Henry Perdriau, of the rubber firm. Lynda
forsook the conventional trappings of satin
and lace, and stood up to her promises in
French grey velvet and a black hat that fitted
snugly to her bobbed head. Mildred Russell
’maided in navy blue smartness cheered by
a bunch of crimson roses. .The Pavilion
housed the wedding dinner.
Bright-eyed Valetta Cohan, who has played
many interesting parts with the Vagabonds,
has promised to play leading lady for life
to Noel Linton. Noel, when not assisting
father to sell law, acts with the clever band
of amateurs. He was an active small-parter
in the Great Drama that began in 1914.
When Arundel Orchard took over his job
of Director of the Conservatorium he found
it rather like a sucked orange. The orches-
tra and the string quartet, as necessary to
the life of a Con. as lungs to the human body,
had faded away. The orchestra was revived
a week or two ago, and now the Director
has conjured up a string quartet. Gerald
Walenn is its leader, and Lionel Lawson,
Alfred Hill and Gladstone Bell are the other
parts. They made their first bow to the
public last week in Haydn’s String Quartet
in G Minor and Brahms’s Quintet in F
Minor. In the latter Myrtle Meggy’s clever
fingers were at the piano.
There were gay doings on the Osterley
when Captain Cameron and his crew took
charge of the children’s party in aid of the
Deaf and Dumb Hostel, and gave the little
guests the time of their lives. Dips, gay
caps and balloons helped the atmosphere of
an afternoon that was steely still. Exciting
events like egg-and-spoon and potato-races
were fiercely contested, and tall sailormen
danced the afternoon away with the little
ones. And when all else palled there was
the funniest clown in the world with a box-
ful of tricks.
Charlie Bean, the Anzac historian, leaves
Australia in July for a six months’ holiday
in Europe. He is just about to write Finis
to the second volume of his history, and after
shovelling and sluicing a mountain of data—
French and German as well as Digger—he
feels he’s about lue for a spell. Charlie
chose the Federal capital for his workday
background, and the effect of Paris on top of
Canberra should be as exciting an experi-
ment as w’hisky on top of champagne.
Australian poet Henry Lawson had a birth-
day last week; and though most of the con-
tinent forgot, the school kiddies remembered.
They've gathering funds for a memorial to
be placed in the Domain, and the educational
world was a round of lectures, concerts, com-
petition essays and collections. Public
librarian Ifould and Minister for Education
Bruntnell aid the rounds of the schools, and
spoke the cheering word to scholars and
teachers intent on the big idea.
Mrs. Ewan Fraser, who sails for England
again next week, mingled a monster tea-
drinking with farewells at the Queen’s Club.
For the past few weeks she has been the
centre of innumerable gatherings, one of the
most intimate staged by the medical Nigel-
Smiths at Double Bay. There were about
50 guests, who were entertained with music
and tennis and bridge. Carnations, roses and
violets filled the rooms with warm color;
and both the hostess and guest of honor
wore triumphal simplicity in black —the
hostess’s carried Chinese embroideries. As
the afternoon waned Mrs. Ewan Fraser sup-
plied by urgent request a piano programme
of unusual charm.
Lady Lawford, who is in Sydney with her
six-foot-two son, has come primarily on busi-
ness. Oswald Watt, her first husband, made
her a large allowance after the divorce a
dozen years ago, but it lapsed as a right
when he died. The son, who is entering his
father’s college at Cambridge next year, in-
herited, in addition to much personality, How-
long station, which was left to Oswald Watt
by his late brother William.
A private cable announces the death in
England of Commander Mortimer, R.N. He
married Kathleen Toohey, sister of Mrs.
Lean Lyon, of Queensland, and niece of Miss
Egan, one of Sydney’s most tireless Red
Crossers. He was mere in command of the
Penguin two years ago.
The old Sir Moses Montefiore Jewish Home
at Moore Park, from which the aged of
Judah have been moved to new quarters at
Bellevue Hill, has been remodelled by the
Salv’army as a hostel for women. The place
was built in 1887, when Darling-street was
quite out in the country, Rabbi Davis hav-
ing promoted a movement of which George
Judah Cohen was the first provisional presi-
dent. For Salv’army purposes the place has
been doubled in size; and the transfer of its
young-women boarders will enable the old
hostel in Eliza beth-street to be used as a
shelter for destitute women.
Sir Derrick Wernher, who has been
arrested on a perjury charge in London, is
connected by marriage with the royal family.
His younger brother —the present heir to the
baronetcy—married one daughter of the
Grand Duke Michael of Russia, and Lord
George Mountbatten, who was in M.L. on
the New Zealand in 1913, is the husband
of the other. The baronet, who is one of
the most persistent insolvents for his age in
Debrett, is not persona grata with his enor-
mously rich mother —the Lady Ludlow who
was robbed the other day of a quarter of a
million pounds’ worth of jewels. This means
that the whole of her colossal fortune will
probably go to the other young man, who
had a distinguished front-line career during
the war, and has sober Parliamentary ambi-
tions.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Sir Matthew handed Queensland’s appreciation to
Allan Wilkie and Miss Hunter-Watts at the close of
•‘Cymbeline” in His Majesty’s Theatre—a performance
which marked Wilkie’s 1000th staging- of Shakspeare’s
plays. His Ex., who had a party with him, made
a jolly little speech, and Mayor Barry read aloud the
illuminated address. Professor Stable was among
those on the stage at the presentation, which included
an inscribed gold watch apiece to the principals and
a handy cheque. The eo. is now in the sunny
North, but before it left the actors gave a dinner
to the Wilkies at Lennons, at which his Ex. was
a guest—also the Stables and Charles Dearden.
The Albion Cup was run on the same day and
the Oxlade and Dash matrons poured tea for a
number of friends in the committee room. The
Cecil Palmers had a verandah party to view the
races from Palma-rosa, the guests including Mrs.
Glynn Connolly, the Cadell Garricks, Justice and Mrs.
Isaacs (Melbourne), the Mustards and Millses, Col.
Bob Stodart and his spouse and the Lipscombes.
Archbishop Duhig was in the audience at Gertrude
Concannon’s concert. The star wore jewelled net and
got many vegetable tributes. Josephine and Eileen
Concannon, who helped, wore pale blue and pink
respectively. The big house held Mrs. Tom Ryan,
the Gillies pair, the Moores and Rogerses and a troop
of girls from All Hallows.
Blood poisoning after an innocent-looking scratch
carried off Mrs. Ragnar Hyne with startling sudden-
ness. She used to be Betty Woolcock, second
daughter of J. L. Woolcock, and was little more
than a girl. She had many friends here, and had
come over from Tonga On a holiday.
Justice and Mrs. Isaacs were dined by Sir Matthew
with our Chief Justice and Mrs. McCawley, Justice
Starke and his wife, Judge Shand and his, Judge
Lukin and his, the A. J. Thynnes and several others.
A.D.C. Turner and Private-Sec. Saunders backed
Sir Matthew up in giving the cheery hand to about
70 guests at a Government House dance. Ivory
and gold sheathed Mrs. Glynn Connolly; Mrs. Yalley-
of-Lagoons Micklem was in blue and silver; Mrs.
Bluff Downs White in black tulle; Mrs. L. Turner
in black panne and fur; Mrs. Lipscombe in her
bridal gown of ivory tulle and sequins; Irma
Dearden (who is soon to change her name to Flower)
in silver; Olga Bruche in blue; and Feo Beith in
gold lace.
Bride-elect Nell Tully has been a much feted
young lady. Margaret Wilson staged a dance m
her honor at Montpelier; Berenice and Cecily Cadell-
Garrick gave her a bridge-and-tennis party; Jean
Graham entertained her at a bridge and ma,h jong
affair; Arthur Feez asked her and some other guests
to lunch at Lennon’s, and Mrs. Cecil Palmer, the
Glynn Connollys and the J. M. Thomsons poured
tea for her at well-attended stances.

The public got its final helping of grand
opera in a quartette of special souvenir per-
formances, each featuring a different leading
lady, with Phyllis Archibald and Augusta
Concato ‘‘twinned” in the two-star “Aida.”
Melba led off on the Monday night as Mar-
guerite. The flaxen locks were worn a-hang-
ing down her back instead of in the conven-
tional brace of side plaits—possibly to dodge
the risk of a middle parting. The Best
Known overflowed the house in their glad-
dest rags . and thundered applause, and the
diva afterwards voiced her thanks from a
garden of flowers. The Stradbrokes scam-
pered round from their circle pew to a side-
pen to hurl laurel wreaths at Melba, who
promptly slung the biggest hoops round her
middle, lifebelt fashion. Gusty cheers greeted
the Dame’s intimation concerning the co.’s
extra week here after the Sydney season, but
there was a chorus of “No, no !” when she
added, “Then I shall sing my Australian
swan song.” The last night of the forth-
coming week’s opera will be substituted for
the concert with which Melba hoped to bag
£20,000 for our tubercular and limbless war
heroes; and after confessing that her meen-
ister had dubbed her Empress of Pickpockets
the Dame opened up her campaign of brigand-
age by selling twin seats for the night at
100 guineas, with a gradual descent to 25.
Lord Stradbroke started the offers. Melba
herself threw in 100 from granddaughter
Pam. Thereafter the Best Gilded rushed in
with bids, and the total eventually mounted
to 2500 guineas.
On the last opera night of all there was a
sparkling performance of “The Barber,” with
Toti dal Monte as the engaging Rosina.
Every seat had been snapped up two days
beforehand. The Stradbrokes had another
engagement at the Alan Curries’ Western
District homestead, but daughter Helena’s
white-fur coat was visible in the circle
between Bettine Browne and Tom Cochran.
The scene at the final curtain recalled the
cartoon in last week’s Bulletin, for besides
a ton or two of flowers all sorts of mer-
chandise, including dolls and a miniature
motor-’bus, were unloaded on to Dal Monte.
Careful mothers nearly shrieked when the
few-weeks-old Tornari babe, encased in what
looked like a white satin slipper, was brought
on to hand godmother Toti some flowers with
the aid of the maternal hand. The male stars
jibbed at the calls for speeches, their English
being not up to the strain, but Dal Monte, who
had learned up her piece, spoke her apprecia-
tion, and, brimming over with the joyous
moment, finally chortled. “You are all a
dear!”
Bird-lovers in the “Aida” audience on the
Wednesday night frowned when they saw
20 terrified canaries flutter blindly out of
traps set in a mammoth floral obelisk sent
to Augusta Concato, presumably by a fellow-
countryman. But their displeasure mounted
to something like fury when con-
ductor Piccaluga playfully seized on one
wretched bird and flung it out towards the
audience. The unfortunate little creature
sought sanctuary on the curtain, where it
beat its wings in terror. One wonders if
all the birds were subsequently recaptured
or if any of them are now starving some-
where up about the roof of the building.
Those responsible might have thought that
the release of a flight of prisoned songbirds
on such an occasion was a charming inspira-
tion ; but its picturesqueness hardly justi-
fied its cruelty.
Ken Macdougall and Brenda Syme had
their matrimonial links truly welded at
Trinity Church, Kew, by Canon Sutton.
Herbert Syme led his second daughter to
the wedding forge, sister Maisie and Helen
Elliot ’maided, a smaller sister had charge
of the bride’s train, and Keith Klingender
and Eric Corney looked after the ’groom.
Mrs. Herbert Syme and Mrs. D. Macdougall
both wore black at the wedding feast, and
among those who partook thereof were the
Geoff Syme pair, with daughter Mardi Ilag-
gard and her husband, newly-knighted Sur-
geon George Syme and his dame, the other
medical member of the clan from Lily dale,
and State Attorney-General Arthur Robin-
son and his wife —he wearing a thoughtful
before-the-elections look. Bridegroom Ken,
who ended his Melbourne Grammar days as
school captain, is the elder hope of the D.
Maedougalls, of Kooyong-road, Toorak.
Phyllis Archibald beckoned her friends
into the Oriental’s cosy winter garden for a
farewell over the teacups. And a frightfully
gathering it was. The guests thrilled
expectantly to the sight of a baby grand nest-
ling among some potted palms, and their
hopes were justified when, cups having beeu
downed, their hostess, looking youthfully
attractive in a dove-grey frock, rose to say
she would show how much she loved her com-
pany b.v singing for them. With Mrs. Theyre
n eigall on the piano-stool, the operatic con-
tralto released a flow of song which held
her audience spellbound.
Birdman Clement Foden started out on
his matrimonial flight with Rosalind Boyd
last week, taking off at the Melbourne Gram-
mar Chapel. Fair Rosalind, who is a daugh-
ter of the late Dr. Boyd, of Bendigo, Was
convoyed to the meeting-place by brother
Hugh, and faced the ordeal without help of
bridesmaid, in bronze satin fused with Orient-
ally colored beads, and topped by a feathered
brown hat. Darcy Power took charge of
the ’groom. The fizz was uncorked at the
Occidental, where the bride’s brother-in-law
and sister, Dr. and Mrs. Bob Strong, spread
a mid-day feast for relatives only. The pair
have now headed for an English ’moon, with
a peep at the Stars and Stripes on the way.
Trinity College students had their annual
feast of jazz and jollity in a well-decorated
St. Ivilda Town Hall on Friday night. Col-
lege Warden Behan and his blue-frocked wife
defied the icy blast to smile approval on the
revel, and Sub-Warden Blackwood, the Re-
gistrar and Profs. Scott and Skeats, all with
their other halves, were there, as well as
quite a lot of old collegians, including big
W. ,T. T. Clarke and his wife, the latter with
her best diamond crown.
Mrs. Everard Browne and her invalid hus-
band started for England last week in com-
pliance with a medical order that the sick
man should take a voyage. This means that
they will miss daughter Gwynnedd’s wed-
ding with Dermot Casey late in August.
Auntie George Chirnside will probably act
for them.
Tenor Borgioli’s wife —she was Patricia
Mort, of Sydney, and is a niece of the alder-
manic Cabenas —epilogued the last Melba
night with a cheery supper-party at her
Garden Court flat. Dame Nellie headed the
string of opera notabilities, who included
Toti dal Monte and Paolantonio; and Lady
Stradbroke slipped the official chain to join
in the revelry with daughter Helena.
Artist Rose Gayer Phipps, wife of the new
medical head of our Navy, is holding a
show of paintings at the Sackville Gallery.
The lady, who was formerly Rose Dakin,
scored her first South Kensington pass at
the mature age of eight, having faced the
exam, ordeal perched atop of a table with
a box for an easel. She naively galloped
through her
drawing in one
hour instead of
the allotted
two, and was
then co n-
dein n e d to
roost on her
perch until all
her elders’ pen-
cils were
downed. She
studied paint-
ing under Stan-
hope Forbes,
R.A., and A.
Newlyn, and
then switched
over to Alyn
Williams for a
course in mini-
ature painting.
Before perma-
nently setting
up her easel
Rose Dakin had begun to make a name for
herself as a sculptor, working under New-
bum Cooke, but a serious accident blue-
pencilled her ambitions in that direction
until last year, when she tackled her clay
again to model a memorial of Professor
Cleghorn for the Calcutta Cathedral, and
also a group of figures for the Darjeeling
Gilds’ School Chapel. Mrs. Phipps, who
for some years has been a regular exhibitor
at the Academy, Paris Salon, etc., is a
member of both English miniature painting
societies, and her work was among that
chosen to represent English miniaturists at
the international exhibition in Canada last
year.
A motor smash last week deprived the
Kew Council of its locally celebrated baronet,
Sir Henry de Castres Kellett, who had lived
long in the suburb as a land-and-estate agent.
Though he came into the title in 1886, he did
not acknowledge it until 20 years after, and
even then did not publicly advertise it, pro-
bably because he found it burdensome in
business. His forebears originally settled in
Norfolk, and a section followed William of
Orange to Ireland, ultimately acquiring land
in Tipperary. The deceased was more in-
terested in amassing a reputation in muni-
cipal politics. He had been 40 years in the
Kew Council, and had sat for a long time on
the Melbourne Fire Brigades Board and Met-
ropolitan Board of Works. The new baronet,
a Sydney man, is married to a daughter of
Easton Johnston.
The two old Ararat families of Gossip and
Hargreaves were tied together by the wedding
of Ella of the former and Arthur of the
latter on June 10, and ceremony and recep-
tion at the Masonic Hall shook up the old
town. Bride’s future home is to be at Hamil-
ton, and Adelaide is the cooing place for the
’mooning doves.
Lafayette thus pictures B’Ldward Mit-
chell’s brainy youngest daughter, Janet. Slid
is the head of
the educational
sector of the
Y.W.C.A., hav-
ing been at-
tracted to the
job by the
possibilities of
educational im-
provement
among femi-
nine wag e -
earners, and
by the call for
method in the
work. Already,
after scarcely
four months,
in office, she
has opened up
nightly classes,
together with
several ne w
channels o f
learning, in-
eluding a series of lectures by experts on a
wide variety of subjects. The young lady’s
intellect lias not been derived from the
Mitchell side of the house only. Her
maternal grandfather was the late Dr. Mor-
rison, the famous Scots College head, who
was a bi-other of the late Geelong College
pedagogue, and thus an uncle of the late
“Chinese” Morrison. Janet Mitchell, who
is a gifted musician, spent three years in
England at the Royal Academy of Music,
after which she sidetracked her musical
career to enter London ’Varsity. She
acquired her B.A. with honors in English,
and then worked at Bedford College under
Professor Caroline Spurgeon, befoi-e steam-
ing back to her native gumtrees.
A striking feature at the recent diamond
jubilee celebrations of Ballarat College was
the vitality of the veterans. The first, second,
third and fifth boys who entered the school
60 years ago were all present at the jubilee
dinner. The four consist of Sam Baird (Mel-
bourne), J. C. Brown (Geelong), C. Hender-
son (Melbourne) and W. G. Finlayson
(Ballarat). All are still in business. Promises
were received from old collegians of nearly
£9OO for the advancement of the college, and
upwards of £2OO for the War Memorial Hall
in addition to the £2OOO that has already
been raised for the latter. The College war
record is probably unbeaten by any Austra-
lian school of this size. Out of a total en-
listment of slightly over 300 no less than
65 made the supreme sacrifice. The decora-
tions won numbered 46, General “Pompey”
Elliott topping the list with six.
James Rudall, the Collins-street eye-
specialist, who, as an amateur, helped the
grand-opera orchestra through its Melbourne
season with his Cor Anglais, was called up
on Thursday night by Nevin Tait to receive
the Firm’s order of merit in the shape of
a silver writing-set of solid proportions. The
medico inherited his professional and musical
leanings frdm his father, who was Mel-
bourne’s foremost eye-doctor in the days be-
fore specialism threatened to extinguish the
general practitioner, and was also a notable
performer on the flute.
Austral Salon members called singer Phyl-
lis Archibald into their temporary shelter of
the Women’s Automobile Club rooms the
other afternoon to receive their blessing.
The comely star made a cheerful entrance in
an opulent musquash coat and black velvet
hat. A musical menu was served up by
Anita Roma, Neville Towne, mandolinist
Manzoni and Natalie Dawson; and Winsome
Thomas and Iris Shaw staged a playlet. The
gathering was an outsize one, and included
Mrs. Horatio Webb, Mrs. Barry Thompson,
ex-Mayoress Stein, and, of course, Mrs.
Quinnell, the Salon’s active hon. sec.
Mrs. Lucy Amelia Boothman, just dead
at St. Kilda, aged 102, had an adventurous
voyage to Sydney in iS39, as a girl of 17.
A mutiny occurx-ed among the crew, and
the. passengers were locked in their cabins
while the men fought the matter out on
deck. In 1840 she went to Tasmania and
was married to Edward Westlake Booth-
man, son of the then Governor’s private sec.
She leaves a numerous clan of four genera-
tions of descendants.
The “Garden of Allah” drew a big crowd
to the Royal on Saturday night, but owing
to the piercing cold the sartorial view was
to a great extent smothered under fur. Mrs.
Geoff Syme, boxed with Mrs. Charlie Camp-
bell and a party, smiled above the cosy
recesses of an ermine wrap, and little Mrs.
Charles Wenman, in a lower pen, was com-
fily snuggled into a darker fur cloak. The
Arthur Spragues, Edna Armytage, a Whit-
ing daughter, Mrs. Walker and the medical
Maudsleys’ daughter Cecil were all in the
circle. Muriel Starr, who has mislaid her
former personality in her new slimness dtiG
a shingled head, is not always iil the picture
with her cityfied frocks and mannerisms:
Mrs. Stapley. who died at the week-end
at South Yarra, was Mayoress ijf Melbourne
in 1917-18. She had beep ib ill-health for
years, and the climbers had almost forgotten
her hospitality and charitable efforts.
Simon jStajugliton has sent word across-
seaS that he has booked for an August wed-
ding with a Canadian girl, youngest daughter
of Professor and Mrs. Howard Jones, of
Halifax. Young Simon inherited the old
family homestead at Melton from his father,
the late Captain S. Staughton, who passed
out soon after bringing back a D.S.O. from
the Boer War, but the greater part of his
life has been spent oversea with his mother,
Mrs. Tom Skene.
It would be interesting to have a reliable
estimate of the number of citizens out of the
thousands whose patronage earned the Opera
Co. £120,000 in Melbourne who honestly
give two straws for good music. This, any-
how, is certain: except when Melba or some
other well-boomed star is in evidence, tin*
vast majority of those who swarmed to the
opera throughout the season that has just
ended here jazz contentedly to the strains
of “Barney Google” or “Yes, We Have No
Bananas” in the intervals of pursuing the
musical-comedy habit. It is not that they
cannot get classical music beautifully ren-
dered if they want it. Melbourne always
has singers, male and female, eager for em-
ployment, and as well fitted by nature and
training to render any Italian opera number
as most of Melba’s importations. Walter
Kirby, for example. Most of the artistic
culture in the higher social reaches would
seem to be compounded partly of gregari-
ousness (to give the thing no harsher name)
and partly of a well-aimed publicity bar-
rage. Society’s love of a good horse —evi-
denced by the rush to the racecourse on the
days that are reported at length in the social
columns of the papers—is an example of the
same spirit. Not five per cent, of these
people would walk a hundred yards to see
a champion thoroughbred if it was detached
from a vice-regal atmosphere; and not two
per cent, would recognise the animal as a
champion unless informed of the fact by
recognised authorities.
Anglo-Australia seems to have crowded out
Holy Trinity Church in Sloane-stret. Lon-
don, on May 3, to see the Sibbald Curries’
elder daughter, Madge, married to Naval-
Lieutenant Harry Mangles Denham. As
her squatter father could not leave his
Western District acreage to hand the bride
over, cousin Stewart Lang went on as under-
study. Sister Nora Currie, Marcia Faulk-
ner and Joan Jackson ’maided, and Tank-
Capt. Willis took charge of the ’groom.
After the newly-weds had passed under the
conventional arch of steel there was health-
drinking at Lincoln House, Basil-street,
with the bride’s mother as hostess. The
inviteds included the bride’s aunt, Mrs. Cal-
vert, the McWhaes, the Alec Landale widow.
Norman Bayles and his wife, the two
Walter Bayles daughters, Estelle Manifold
and Mary Buckley. Among the congratu-
latory wires received by the ’groom was oiie
from Edward P. to his old shipmate on the
Renown’s Australian cruise, and another
from Admiral Halsey.
Young Maoriland water-colorist Betty
Gilfillan has returned to her boiling springs.
During her stay in Australia the talented
girl studied under MacNally, who is much
pleased with her progress.
A few lines from Adelaide:—
Lady Forbes-Robertson and the feminine members
of her eo. (she in black with a touch of cherry, arid
a fur coat) were tea-ed at the Town Hall by the
Mayoress, with the Children’s Hospital Ball com-
mittee, a suburban mayoress or two, and City coun-
cillors’ wives to meet them.
On the same evening there was a bachelors’ ball
at the Osborne Hall, with 13 hosts, vast “13’s” os
features of the decorations, open umbrellas, ladders
and anything else that would make the superstitious
tremble. The hosts included some of the “Healo”
cast, and among the guests were the show’s star
dancer Maxime Tolley, Jean Mcholls, Florence Hill
and her sister, Lilian Henderson and the Kenneth
Duifields.
The latest farewell has been that for Ariel Shearer,
who had William Silver to help her at a second
piano in her opening number, and whose playing
roused the audience to a clamorous pitch. Hilda
Gill, Vera Thrush, Richard Watson, George Pearce,
Harold Parsons, Charles Schlisky and Harold Wylde
combined to make tne benefit a success, and the
Bridges, Mayoral Glovers and Harold Davies were
there to lead the applause.
One of the biggest efforts for the Children’s Hos-
pital Appeal was the ball at the Palais—a frivol
which attracted most of the dancing set and some
of the older generation as onlookers, and to which
90 per cent, of the Hugh Ward co. came after the
curtain had been rung down at the theatre. It whs
in the hands of a committee headed by the Mayoress
and Miss Murray, and practically a replica Of that
which ran the Fleet Week festivities. The Bridges
were there (she fresh from a Girl Guide meeting at
the Women’s Club in a draped tissue frock with a
bandeau of gold and pearls in her hair), and with
them came Miss Judge, in black and silver, arid
Capt. Hambleton.

19 Trips around the World!
In 51/2 years of constant, gruelling service, a
Studebaker Big-Six travels half a million miles
—equivalent to 19 trips around the world
ASTUDEBAKER Big-Six, built in 1918,
recently completed its 475,000 th mile
‘ in service. And not easy service either.
Its daily task for the past three years had
been to carry a huge cargo of newspapers
a 400-mile mountain course.
To crown its record for long life and bull-
dog endurance, this venerable old car recently
made a sensational run across North Ameri-
ca. And it arrived in New York on schedule
time. Not a single mechanical difficulty was
experienced in its 4,000-mile dash across the
United States in the dead of winter.
Think of the significance attached to this
feat. This veteran Big-Six had already tra-
veled nearly half a million miles —a distance
equivalent to 19 trips around the world.
And still it was going strong!
A veteran performing like a youngster!
We know of no finer demonstration of
motor car endurance.
And yet factory records show that there
are many Studebaker cars that have traveled
250,000 miles. And scores with service
records of over 100,000 miles.
Such remarkable endurance in Studebaker
cars—this ability to deliver long and satis-
factory service—is not attained by accident.
It is due to finer steels that Studebaker uses,
on some of which a 15 per cent premium is
paid to secure better than average quality.
It is due to careful, exacting workmanship.
Every Studebaker car receives 32,000
inspections before it leaves the factorjl.
For 72 years, Studebaker’s only objective
has been QUALITY. The reward of its
manufacturing endeavours is the world-wide
endorsement of Studebaker products. To-
day, Studebaker is the world’s largest pro-
ducer of fine cars. In justice to yourself,
you should see what Studebaker offers you
before you buy a motor car!

SURE CATCH TACKLE
After Rahda’s success, with list. 61b., in
the V.A.T.C. Toolambool Hurdle, he looked a decent
bet for the V.R.C. Grand National, in which he will
have 181 b. less. The Sea Prince gelding disposed of
a strong field—it included Mnemar, Moogana, Jack-
staff, Bronzillet and Gay Serenader —-in most con-
vincing stjte, and landed some nice bets for his
owner, a |shner West-
ralian bookmaker, who
served with distinction
in the war. Another
good National trial at
Caulfield was that ol
the trustworthy Chry-
sostom (2’s), who regis-
tered his fourth suc-
cessive , win in the
Wanda (Steeplechase
and was in front all
the way. Haoma chased
him most of the time,
but the weight (13st.
21b.) told on the game
little South Australian
over the last half-mile,
and Sing didn’t punch
him out. The black
carried his National
weight, list. 131 b ;
and Haoma will meet
him at Flemington on
121 b. better terms.
SYD TORR,
owner of Wynette.
By winning the Flying Welter at Rosehill
(N.S.W.) Pixy Ring (The Welkin—Quintanona)
earned a small fortune for “A. Fuller,” who is
about the biggest amateur punter in Australia.
But a lot of the money went back into the bag
when the mare was downed by Otacre in the Prince
of Wales Stakes on the second day of the meeting.
Though one of the last away, and disappointed of
an opening in the straight, the black Linacre stallion
finished grandly on the outside and got there by
half a length in lmin. 141 sec. for the six furlongs.
Decent time in the circumstances, and considering
that he was burdened with 9st. 71b.

“H. Hardupp”: The monotony of the pro-
ceedings at Taletellers’ Park was brightened recently
by a dispute between Kohanstein, the bookie, and
Wholagan, his offsider, who used to be an M.L.A.
Wholagan had gone astray in his figures, and Kohan-
stein shot vicious insults at him in the intervals of
calling the odds. Presently paying-out was suspended
to admit of Kohanstein rising to the height of his
argument. “Spare me days,” he cried, “ cahn’t yer
vake up ? Ye’re not runnin’ the blarsted gountry
now—ve’re vorkin’, man v or kin’! Y’y doncher vork?”
* * * *
“15-30”: Before he left Melbourne Gerald
Patterson talked confidently about bringing home the
Davis Cup, but little William Johnston declares that
the Australians haven’t a hope. The Californian has
shown how he feels about it by decisively hammer-
ing Patterson in two or three exhibition matches in
his own State. Incidentally, he supports my long-
held view of O’Hara Wood as a singles player by
remarking that he expects Wood to give him more
trouble than Patterson. The latter’s game is charac-
terised by an almost unchangeable routine in service
and ground-work. There i* little variation in his
attack, except in the occasional use of the old Ameri-
can reverse service, which, through lack of the
proper control, is nearly always a “fault.” Playing
off the ground he relies a lot on a heavy cut, but,
not being a Wallace Johnson, who is expert in
this practice, he cannot place the balls well enough
to make them effective against first-class men. I
fear that Patterson’s trouble is sheer inability to mix
his game and try odd lines of tactics. He is not
a strategist, as Tilden is—he will never experiment-
alise with an opponent just to discover the strength
of his stroke equipment—and in the result Johnston
and Tilden regard him with less respect than they
have for Wood, who is decidedly his superior in volley-
ing and backhand play, even though the Wood
service is not nearly so prolific in aces.
* * * *
France speedily settled India’s chances for
the Davis Cup. The Gauls put the issue beyond
doubt by winning the first three matches, Cochet
and Lacoste taking the singles from Sleem and
Jacob, and Cochet and Brugnon beating Hadie and
Fyzee in the doubles. Curiously enough, Cochet
and Lacoste registered the same figures, losing a set
each in their respective battles; but Lacoste scored
the more meritorious victory over Sleem, generally
acknowledged to be one of the finest exponents of
the “passing shot” in the world. He plays entirely
from the baseline and prefers to let most “drop
shots” go sooner than leave his favorite position.
Without anything like a first-class equipment of
strokes Sleem has put up some amazing fights on
British and Eruopean courts. Over in Copenhagen,
little Denmark has been gamely holding its own, the
latest victims being the Italians Mopurgo and
Colombo, who played in both singles and doubles
Mopurgo, who has a strong service, was responsible
foi Italy’s two wins in the singles, but the Danes
were much too good in the other matches; the last
set of the doubles Was 6—o in their favor.
* # # *
Helen Wills, the American, has made a
sad beginning in England by losing in straight sets
to Mrs. Covell and Miss McKane. Playing in her
own country, she decisively defeated Miss McKane,
who was puzzled by the high bounce of the American
ball. No doubt the young Californian’s play was
affected by the comparative restfulness of the Eng-
lish missile. As soon as she gets more accustomed
to the new conditions-'—she has been a little over
a month in England—there may be another story to
tell.
* * * *
A sterling performance was that of L. J.
Brodie, a Westralian naval man, in winning the
novice cross-country championship of N. S. Wales
at Rose Bay. Going to the front at the gun,
Brodie, who ran in the St. George club’s colors,
soon had a substantial lead, and when the five miles
had been traversed he was 38 seconds ahead of the
next man, J. Waters. His time, 29min. 485e0.,
was 27sec. faster than that of Frank Bailey last
year, and Bailey’s subsequent performances were so
good that many thought he should have gone with the
Olympic team. The Jarrahlander will be a formid-
able opponent for Bailey, Sheaves, Kohlman and the
rest in the more important races ahead.
* * * #
“Nollig”: Talking of overworked school-
boy athletes (somebody was a while ago) was there
ever a worse case than that of Reg Broomby, of
Launceston (Tas.) High Schools? In one afternoon
Broomby won the 100yds. in 10 3-ssec., the 220yds.
in 24 l-ssec., the 440yds. in 55sec., the 880yds. in
2min. 18see., the mile in smin. 14 2-ssec. and the
high jump (4ft, Bin.). He had to run a heat before
winning the hundred; moreover he came second in
the 120yds. hurdles, and pulled in the tug-of-war.
The S.P.O.A. ought to give its attention to such
cases. Man, it has been written, is merely a two-
legged animal without feathers.

The supply of 20-round boxers having tem-
porarily given out, the Sydney Stadium management
put on a programme in which Pat Gleeson out-
pointed Les Reynolds in 10 rounds, and Frank Locke
stopped Charlie May in seven. They were quite
animated little arguments, but there was not much in
them for the bruisers, all welterweights—only about
a pound each per round after the proprietary’s 50 p.c.
and Locke’s expenses from Queensland had been de-
ducted. Sydney won’t pay 21s. Bd., 10s. 10d., ss.
6d. and 3s. 3d. to see second-raters, however spiritedly
they may fight.
* * * *
Judged on his showing against Ern Waddy,
at Melbourne, Billy Shade has learned little since
his first visit to Australia. The short-haired Crow-
eater, who is quite 15 years older than the Ameri-
can, gave as good as he got for nine rounds; then
the referee declared him the loser on a hotly-disputed
foul. There was once talk of matching Shade
against Carpentier for £5OOO of John Wren’s money.
Carpentier missed an easy £5OOO.
* * * •
“Snow” : Now that little George Mendies is
gone, those of our pugs, who shape up right hand
foremost are a poor lot. I't would be harsh to
compare them with such as Peter Toohey, Fred Kay,
and the Queensland abo. Jerry Jerome. Toohey
was a great bantam in his day, Kay outpointed
Saylor and Clabby when both were at the top of
their form, and Jerome might have been a world
beater had he been caught young and made to train
properly. And there was George Seale, the brilliant
all-round amateur of the ’eighties and probably the
best of them all. Old-timers still talk of the punch
with which George flattened out Steve O’Donnell,
Peter Jackson’s pet pupil and afterwards a crack
heavyweight in America. It was a perfectly-timed
left on the solar plexus, and Steve—very much the
weightier man, for George was a mere eleven-stoner
—dropped like six feet of pig-iron.
* * * *
“Zanthus”: If “Topee” wants to find some
of the “butcher-boats” whose disappearance from
Port Jackson he laiffents (B. 12/6/’24), he should
look on the Clarence River. And if he can get
together a butcher-boat crew to beat the crack
Clarence River four, which includes three Searles,
nephews of the famous sculler (poor Harry learned a
lot in butcher-boats), there is a pot of money in it.
The last time I was in Grafton enthusiastic residents
of that stronghold of Dr. Earle Page told me that
they would back the local champions against any
four in Australia in a butcher-boat race. I gathered
that they had the Federal Treasury behind them, for
they offered to make the stake anything from £200.0
to £5OOO.
* * * *
“Toosday” (U.S.A.) : No advertising cam-
paign was needed in the U.S.A. to get money for the
Olympic Games. Newhaven, the town I live in, con-
tributed 5000 dollars in a few days, yet the popula-
tion is only 15,000, and one-third are Italians. The
Murray Bridge crew will be up against weight,
strength and money. For example, the Duluth
Chamber of Commerce, which presented Hoover,
winner of the Diamond Sculls, with a 25,000-dollar
house, has had the Duluth eight training at Miami,
Florida, all the winter; the oarsmen, with Hoover,
are now quartered in Philadelphia. The rowing
colleges, from Harvard to Washington, are battling
for the Olympic selection, and the Naval Academy eight
of 1920 have been collected from all the States of the
Union. Who pays their expenses hasn’t been men-
tioned. Whether Yale, Washington or Cornell, of
the colleges, or the Duluth or Philadelphia “Vespers,”
of the club eights, are finally selected, there can be no
doubt that the Yank quarters in Paris will outshine
those of their rivals in all things necessary for keep-
ing men in first-class fettle. The Cods will meet a
MORIARTY, the Fitzroy (Vic.) goal-sneak.
boatload averaging at least 12st. 41b., rigged in big

oars. In style the unorthodox Bridgers will see
something more unorthodox in the way of short
swing, bent arms and lugged finishes. They will
have to travel the 2000 yards in something better
than 6min. 9sec. —6min. ssec. was the Antwerp
time —to win.
* * # *
The English Rugby Leaguers have struck
form with a vengeance. After a defeat at Brisbane
and another at Toowoomba (the fine local club
scored 23 to 20) the tourists, strengthened by
Hurcombe, made a N.S.W. XIII look third-rate,
overwhelming them by 43 to 5. Yet they played a
man short in the second half. The crowd reliev’d
its feelings by counting out the Sydney XIII, who
were without Horder, Blinkhorn, Latta, Oxford and
others. Greatly encouraged uy their success, the
Englishmen, now led by Param, met Australia in
a hard, rough game, witnessed by 65,000 Sydney-
siders, and emerged victors by 22 to 3. The
Aussies held their own in the opening half, but
went to pieces after Potter had been ordered off
for plugging one of the visitors, and the burly
British forwards made it easy for their backs to
score. Behind the scrum, Parkin played a splendid
game; he got over twice himself and helped both
Price and Rix to cross. And the full-back, Sullivan,
marked and kicked beautifully, contributing 10 points
(6 goals) to the total, while Gallagher and Burgess
were of great service among the forwards. It wasn’t
Watt’s fault that the Australians were beaten, for
the Balmain hooker did better than Bennett, and
Potter played grandly till he was compulsorily
retired. Latta, Aynsley and Frauenfelder were also
serviceable. But Craig hung on far too much, Horder
and Blinkhorn were never conspicuous, and the tack-
ling was noticeably inferior to that of the invaders.
Hence the heavy defeat, which a section of the
huge crowd took badly—in an utterly rotten spirit,
indeed.
* * * *
“Past Grammar”: N.S.W. Rugby League
seems to have given up its eiloits to cstablisn uie
professional code in Maoriland. The last side it
sent over had to cancel the latter part of its pro-
gramme because teams could not be raked up to meet
it at the centres selected for propaganda. The
Sydney authorities have cut M.L. out of the itinerary
of the English team, though previous sides have
visited the Shivery Isles. Nor will they bring any
Maori or M.L. combination across. But the final kybosh
has been put on the League’s pretensions by the figures
of the Government sports census taken in the
Dominion. Rugby Union heads the list with 40,000
active players, compared with Soccer’s 6000 and
League’s 3818. Racing claims 25,000 club members
(including trot fiends), and tennis, golf, cricket,
hockey, swimming, athletics and bowls are all more
popular than the League code, which finishes a short
head in front of croquet and rowing.
* * * *
“Centurion”: The N.S.W. Rugby Union
selectors have picked A. E. Toby, of Y.M.C.A., as
first choice for the full-back position in the match
against the All Blacks on July 5. For some years
past, Otto Nothling, of Uni., has had a mortgage
on the position, but Otto has been messed about
by his club, which has been utilising him as a
wing threequarter, and has thereby lost his grip on
his natural game. Toby, who only came into first
grade with his club last season, has played with
Y.M.C.A. since he was 14. Though barely a middle-
weight, he is a deadly tackier, as well as a fine
field and kick.
* * * *
“Centurion” : Few of the All Blacks to
visit us next month are better known than H. G.
(“Baldv”) Munro, who has four times come to Syd-
nev with the combined M.L. Universities. Though
in' the pony class as forwards go (he scales list.
121 b.), Munro is a rattling all-rounder in ruck and
loose, and on his last visit here with the ’Varsities
he hooked with conspicuous success. Only 27, he
is as bald as an unconvincing narrative, and his
shining occiput is a rallving-point for his mates
in the close stuff. Naturally, he is a favorite with
barrackers, who invariably prize a bald or red-
headed player far above rubies.
* * * *
The third international Soccer match, at
Sydney, was easy for the Australians, who kicked
tour goals to the Canadians’ one. The umpire had
to read the Riot Act to some of the players and
one of the Australians was sent off. The crowd
angrily resented his breach; on the other hand,
one of the English Leaguers was hooted on leaving
the field by larrikins on the Cricket Ground, and
in the members’ pavilion at that. Followers of
British Association and Rugby Union, in Sydney at
least, have a much better sense of what is due to
visiting teams than the “sports” who talk through
their pockets at League matches.
* * * *
“Lond.”: There were no moving-pictures
of this year’s Soccer Cup final in England. Last
year the Football Association had Topical, Paths and
Gaumont all bidding against each other, and the
first-named paid £lOOO for the film rights. They
have since consolidated, as the British National Film
League, and this time it made a mere £4OO offer,
which the association turned down. Neither side
would budge, so there was nothing doing. It was a
struggle worth recording, too. Pretty well all
through Aston Villa showed up best, but could not
beat the Newcastle goalkeeper; a mere substitute, he
became famous in one afternoon. Just as the thing
looked like being a goal-less draw, Newcastle had a
delirious 90 seconds in which they scored twice.
And then the bell went.
* * * *
Bitter weather on Saturday kept the
gross attendance at Melbourne’s four League games
down to about 76,000. The play was more vigorous
than spectacular, especially in the Collingwood-Fitzroy
match, where illegal fist work and wicked elbow
jabs were very much in evidence. The Magpies
seem to have forgotten their famous “system,” and
Fitzroy were always a little too good, winning by
68 points to -61. They have an unbeaten record to
date. The South-Geelong collision was likewise strenu-
ous and unscientific. There were never more than
five points between them, and the Red-and-Whites
emerged with three to the good-—South 48; Geelong
46. Richmond and Carlton also bogged in regardless
of consequences, bowling each other over with an
enthusiasm that kept the trainers and assistants busy.
The Tigers gathered in 38 points to Carlton’s 28.
Essendon pushed Melbourne a step further down
by annexing 71 to 42. The conclusion of the first
half of the home-an 1-home matches leaves “Roy”
with 32 points; ’Don next with 22; South with
20 ; and ’Wood, Richmond and Geelong with 12 each.
The others don’t count.
“Tren”: Because the conservative Melbourne foot-
ball authorities will not borrow a rule from Rugby
and allow’ substitutes for players badly injured, it
has become a point of honor among footballers to
stay on the field while they are conscious. So, every
week occur spectacles that are on a level with bull-
fighting. At Collingwood on Saturday Gordon Coven-
try’s collar-bone crumpled in the first quarter, yet,
rather than leave the Magpies shorthanded, he kept
a position on the attacking line for the remaining
three quarters. When he got the ball he was as
dangerous as ever. Fitzroy backs, therefore, took no
chances but rolled him as if he were uninjured.
Time and again he would reel from a bump or a
crush and go down in agony. Then the abuse from
the spectators was worthy of the disgusting scene.
* * * *
“Wink”: Melbourne footballers who yearn
for bigger money than the metropolitan clubs, with
their uniform wage systems, allow are getting lavish
offers from the country. Stawell, for example, has
been trying to lure Shorten, the Essendon midget,
with £lO a week, a suitable job, first-class accommo-
dation for himself and family, and a motor-car
thrown in. Shorten accepted, too, but when Essen-
don him a clearance and promised him dis-
qualification if he left without one, he decided to
stay amid the applause he loves so much.
* * * *
“Wilfrido”: Major H. D. Gillies, whose
10-inch tees seem to have made the English golf die-
hards nearly cough blood, hails from M.L., where his
brother pursues law for a crust and laid out the
Hamilton links as a. pastime. Gillies is a surgeon
with a brilliant ’Varsity record, and is widely
esteemed in his profession. He argues that by
perching the ball on top of a rubbered spike he can
obtain better control over it and achieve a longer
drive.

“Tu Hawaiki” : Athletes are usually mus-
cular brutes who know little and care less about
psychic forces, or the supremacy of mind over matter.
Otherwise they might take a hint on training from
“Under the Southern Cross,” in which Horace Leaf
tells the story of his spiritualist pilgrimage to Aus-
tralia. In Adelaide Horace met H. G. Wilson,
“amateur champion walker of South Aus.” Wilson
“assured me that although he was invariably scratch
man in long-distance races he had never trained
on the course or road. His method is what he
calls muscle-control; it consists of standing before
a mirror for about seven minutes each evening,
and willing that his muscles shall move and be under
his complete control. He imagines himself walking
and winning, contracting and relaxing his muscles
and swinging his arms as if he were actually taking
part in a race. This method of training, he assured
me, worked out more satisfactorily than the orthodox
methods ; and it was much less trying and Required
less time.” Perhaps so; but if Dempsey prepared
like that for a meeting with Wills, it would be a
million to one on Wills.
* * * *
“Post Grammar”: “Adelaide” (B.
12/6/’24) questions whether the C. T. Studds will
get the hundred young missionaries they are seek-
ing. Why not? Missioning in Africa is not half
a bad game. Living is good, and even missionaries
can get decent shooting. These inducements, and the
fact that thousands of educated youngsters are at a
dead-end since the war, will certainly help recruit-
ing in England, where cricket and religion seem to
go hand in hand. One recalls that Lancashire
parson who was so superior and sanctified that when
old Tom Emmett, of Yorkshire, at last got past
his defence, Tom said, “Thank God, there goes his
pulpit!” We had a candidate for holy orders out
here in Norman Druce, the Cambridge-Surrey crack
of one of Stoddart’s teams. A godly youth was Nor-
man, and a magnificent outfield withal. The only
time he was known to drop a catch was when fielding
near the old cement track on the Sydney Cricket
Ground. As he waited for one of Howell’s sky-
scrapers to come down, a voice from the “Hill” said,
earnestly and convincingly, “Drop it, Norm, an’
you can kiss my sister.” Dropped it was, but no
one ever heard if Druce collected the wages of
butterfingers.
FURENS QUID FEMINA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘You shouldn’t take any notice of a woman’s
remarks made in the heat of a game or a contro-
versy,’ Mdlle Lenglen told an interviewer who re-
called her outburst at Cannes when an English
linesman foot-faulted her. ‘I am liable to damn
anybody when I am feeling cranky, but l don’t
mean it.’ ”
What did I call the English? I regret it,
Whatever it was, but please to tell me what
Was the expression. Cochons! Oh, forget it!
Fierce was the tension and the day was hot,
And in extenuation you should set it
My goat, in ’Murkan idiom, was got.
Or, putting it in English if you like,
I had the spike.
I must have rapped it out before I listed,
I didn’t really mean he was a swino
Who, spite of my assurances, insisted
I had a toe or two across the line.
My mental outlook was a trifle twisted
Seeing I was annoyed—and feminine.
Blame not too harshly from a woman’s lips
These little slips.
There’s many a sport—Castilian or Yankee,
Phlegmatic Saxon or impetuous Celt—
Bites on a blunter, bluer word than blanky
If he believes he’s biffed below the belt,
And when a woman feels a little cranky,
As on that day I quite admit I felt,
’Twould take a bigger miracle to stop
Her going off pop.
He faulted me! Whereat my temper vaulted
All boundary lines. But this is my amende.
Whether or not with quivering foot I faulted
My lapsus linguae I can scarce defend.
Convention’s rules I patently assaulted,
But what I hissed at him I didn’t intend.
When angry passions in her bosom buzz
No woman does.

“Lond.”; H. W. Lucy, who died a rich man, made
a lot of charitable bequests, two of which touch his
life-long profession. £lOOO goes to help any mem-
bers oi tne Press Gallery in tne House of Commons
who may need it; and the interest cn £lOO is to
buy, four times a year, a box of 25 cigars, for
smoking at the staff dinners which are still a
feature in the office of Punch.
“Billy See”: W.A. got its first printing-press in
1831. It was a small, hand-worked aiiair, imported
from Van Diemen’s Land, and previously responsible
for the Speck’s initial newspaper. The owner hired
it out at two guineas per week to C. Manfaull and
W. K. Shenton, who thereupon produced the Fre-
mantle Observer. When the first copy was being
impressed the first bushel of wheat grown in the
colony was being ground in the same building.
“Kyver”: As a free lance my grouch is
that some Sydney weeklies and monthlies pay
even the smallest amounts by cheque. I live in
Melbourne, and recently 1 received a cheque
for 7s. 4d. in payment for a contribution. It cost
me lid. stamp to forward the claim, Is. exchange
on the cheque, and a lid. stamp to send back a
receipt, reducing my remuneration from 7s. 4d. to
6s. Id., or from 21d. a line to 2d. Payments so
small as these might be made by postal-note or money-
order.
“Bonang”: As a steady job Teddy O’Loughlin
tries to read Fuller’s mind and to guess Bruxner’s
next move for the Sydney Evening News; but he
gets to something a little more adventurous in his
spare time. The other day he and a mate walked
from Cooma (N.S.W.) through Delegate, then clown
through Bonang and Bendoe, and on through Gipps-
land to Orbost. It meant a tramp of over 150
miles; but it was child’s play to the walk they
would have taken, over Kosciusko and through to
Omeo, if the weather had been warmer.
A correspondent reminds The Bulletin that an
old desk on which the late Edmund Fisher wrote
many a bright paragraph and piece of verse had an
interesting history. The desk, which went up in
smoke along with The Bulletin’s Melbourne office a few
months back, was formerly on the bench of Melbourne
Criminal Court, and over it the late Justice Stawell
lesnt when sentencing Npd Kelly to death. Fisher
also possessed a gruesome memento of the late
Deeming—-a realistic sketch of the criminal hanging
after death, the work of G. Rossi Ashton, for some
years The Bulletin’s Melbourne artist.
“The Rumpus”; I’ve written a hoodoo story. The
first editor into whose hands it fell accepted it,
and died a week later. Apparently he had been so
loath to let the MS. out of his sight that he
had taken it home with him; his widow returned
it to me. The next. editor notified me that he
would publish the yarn at an early date, but before
he could keep his promise his journal ceased publi-
cation. A third editor proclaimed the story a master-
piece, but about this time he had to face a libel
action and a printers’ strike; and in the stress laid
upon him he lost my MS. I have rewritten the
thing better than its original, and am wondering
to which paper I owe a bad turn.
“Huffin-Guffin”: The inventive pressman who an-
nounced the prospective marriage of Marie Corelli to
a M.L. squatter (B. 5/6/’24) has had predecessors in
the leg-pulling business. W. T. Reay, now of
London, formerly of Melbourne Herald, once printed
a yarn that went all round the world. It was in
the early ’eighties, when he owned and edited the
Coleraine (Vic.) Albion. ’ One week, when local
news was scarce, a half-column article appeared an-
nouncing that the fossilised remains of Noah’s Ark
had been found on Mount Ararat. The article was
acknowledged as being from the Levant Herald.
It was copied in so many papers that it wasn’t till
long afterwards that Reay was game to acknowledge
the fake.
“Dido”; “Te Pana” states (B. 5/6/’24) that “the
freelance fills more and more of the papers.” I
should like to know where this is a feature of daily
or weekly journalism. I am a freelance myself, and
have been so for 40-odd years, with one brief recent
intermission of a few months. Coming back to free-
lancing, I find practically all the old avenues closed
to me. Of half a dozen papers I formerly worked for,
The Bulletin alone continues to accept outside mat-
ter ; the others have all closed or are closing their
doors upon the freelance. The fact is the Australian
Journalists’ Association has just about killed • the
freelance —killed him with kindness, having so im-
proved his prices that dailies and weeklies find it
more profitable to keep full staffs to satisfy their
needs.
“Marminga”: The Mitchell Library trustees have
recently acquired a file of the 68 issues of the ex-
ceedingly rare Shearers’ Record, first printed at
Allendale, near Creswick (Vic.), in February, 1888.
Later, publisher-printer Andrew removed his plant
to Newport, Melbourne. The A.W.U. —though it
wasn’t called the A.W.U. in those days—and its offi-
cial mouthpiece were founded by a Creswick native
named David Temple, a shearer, who followed the
industry in three States. He was assisted in his
organising work by Alex. Poynton, Ed. Grayndler
and the latter’s brothers, Charles and Joe. The
Shearers’ Record was succeeded by the Worker,
which was firstly the Hummer, published at Wagga
during the early ’nineties. One other file of the first
A.W.U. paper is known to be in existence —at the
Melbourne Public Library.
“Bloggs”: A Sun criticism of Mrs. Forrest’s “The
Wild Moth” printed a sample of what it called
“sloppy places”:—
“Her pink garden! After to-day she would plant
all white flowers there; the kind one places over
the dead who die young. Clear white azaleas that
bruise as easily as a woman’s reputation, dainty vir-
gin lilies that are like old maids shut round by
little green hedges of convention, white roses that
have no passionate golden hearts, no scarlet strains.”
“There speaks the poetess,” .commented the reviewer
—“real folk do not think like that.” Apparently the
writer considers that eminently sane and solid citi-
zens like Shakspeare and Milton were “unreal,” and
that the exquisite dreams which the poet-novelists
(Hardy, Meredith, Flaubert, Anatole France) have
put into the hearts of their characters should De sub-
edited out of existence as “sloppy”! The sooner this
type of perky illiterate goes back to police-court
reporting the . better, it seems to me, for the pros-
pects of Australian literature.

In the third act of “Bohfeme” at Sydney
Majesty’s on Saturday Melba came into her
own, and the Indian-summer gold of her
voice in Mimi’s melodious scene with Rudot-
pho thrilled the ear and melted the heart.
From the crystal purity of the first piteous
“addio” the Voice swept to its triumphant
end. It is unfair to the Melba of other days
to claim that her Mimi is as good as new.
Those who recognise that can at the same
time admit that here is the great artist who,
in spite of unbecoming costume, and in spite
of the cold fingers of time on the larynx,
can exalt her audiences with the love story,
and sway them to pity at the fragile flower-
maker’s end. Tenor Dino Borgioli can be
recommended as a model by which all poets
might plan their appearance. An attractive-
looking person whose poverty didn’t interfere
with his laundry bills, judging by the im-
maculate look of his socks, he sang the part
of Rudolpho pleasingly but never entranc-
ingly. Yet he won his audience from his
first musical argument with the other occu-
pants of the attic; and when he, melodic
and noble, saved some poor overworked editor
the job of reading his poems by burning
them to thaw the garret, a dress-circle ten-
anted by hosts of editors and near-editors
could scarcely refrain from cheers. Unlike
most tenors, Borgioli doesn’t depend solely
on his warble to get his applause. His
acting was earnest, and he was eminently
convincing as the young poet. Of the other
Bohemians (or should they now be called
Czeclio-Slovakians?), French baritone Alfred
Maguenat as Marcello introduced a melodious
baritone and a dashing air into F'“ ■ r ’ggle
for daily bread; while Gustmq F Vrdeau
philosophised in a resonant lvisn, and paid
a touching farewell to the ovo-' o th was
pawned too late. As Musette. A • •or ■ Ret-
tore displayed a graceful little f -nr.', and
got every ounce out of the attractive parr.
Antonio Laffi as the musician made a good
first impression, and Azzolini. who double-
banked the parts of the landlord and the
Councillor of State, proved a comedian who
runs to exuberance. The production of the
Puccini work was an artistic achievement,
and the orchestra was just as near perfect
as this Page expects ever to hear. Conductor
Paolantonio richly deserved his share of the
curtain calls.

Donizetti’s “Lucia” further warmed up the
Sydney opera-going public on Monday night;
and from now on the rush for the box plan
may be expected to be as great as it was in
“WHIRLED INTO HAPPINESS .” AT
MELBOURNE HIS MAJESTY'S.
Kitty Reidy, as Florrie, has her first leading
part; Cecil Kellaway, as Albert ’Orridge,

Frith, as Matthew Platt.
Melbourne. The quaint old story, set to
syrupy music, introduced Dal Monte to audi-
ences that are going to marvel more and
more at the heights to which her sparkling
voice can fling itself, at a technique that can
make trill and sob equally realistic. The
plump little lark proved herself a clever actress,
too, and wove herself into a fine pattern of
frenzy, on her stiletto-like heels, in the Mad
Scene. Her frocking, though, is lament-
able—surely Scott’s bride of Lammermoor
did not trill about the green lawns in
magenta velvets. If that is tradition, tradi-
tion should be made to change the color of its
coat. The part of the unfortunate Ravenswood
was taken at the last moment by tenor
Antonio Marques in place of the billed Bor-
gioli. Neither Marques’s voice nor figure is
suitable to the part, his voice sounding pecu-
liarly uneventful throughout. It is a good
voice, and Marques is a master of his craft;
but. somehow, the always silken-smooth
music became oily through his medium. As the
tyrant brother, Grandini was not an aesthetic
success. He is the owner of a big baritone
that did its best work in the immortal sestet.
Luigi Cilia, as the unlucky bridegroom who
was punctured by Lucia on the wedding
night, deserved a better fate in view of
his fine singing and acting. Di Lelio,
the basso, as Raymond, the family friend,
made one of the hits of the performance.
There was a nobility about his peace efforts
that makes the League of Nations look
second-rate. The scenery and the dressing
were rich and artistic, and the most lavish
ever seen by “Lucia” devotees in this coun-
try. The staging of the Castle Hall with
the clans gathered in their braw velvets and
best tartans caused a pleased “Oh!” through
the house. The orchestra, under Paolan-
tonio, was again as close to perfection as
mortal ear can hope to record; and the stir-
ring entrance of flute and harp into the
melodic argument made bits of sheer delight.
Hearers cannot soon forget poor crazy
Lucia’s cadenzas to flute accompaniment.

In “Old Bill. M.P.,” by Bruce Bairns-
father, the author (personated by Vivian
Edwards) muses in his studio on the sad
state of post-war Britain, and invokes the
assistance of the genial character with ihe
walrus moustache whom he invented in 1914,
and who can always be depended upon to
save England and keep a chicken boiling in
the Bairrisfather pot. Thus commissioned,
Bill (Seymour Hicks) gets work in a coal-
mine, along with his rather trving associates
Alf (Fred Lloyd) and Bert (Frank Hather-
le.y.), and there foils a Bolshevist plot, the
work of Les Warton. who used to be an in-
offensive black-face comedian, Austen Milroy
(Newtown always had its suspicions of
Austen) and Reginald Collins. Rescued
from the wrecked pit. Bill establishes peace
between the miners he has saved and tlicir
employer (George Dean), an incredible peer,
is encouraged by the latter to stand for Par-
liament, and conquers a doubting electorate
by making a speech in his old trench outfit,
tin hat and all. On his way to Westminster,
overcome by thoughts of his first speech, he
strays into the Abbey, sees a vision of the
Unknown Soldier, and lays a flower on the
tomb. There are 14 scenes and a mul-
titude of characters, some of whom
are reminiscent of Bland Holt melo-
drama and others of “On Our Selection.”
It would be base flattery to call it a first-
class play, but Hicks is a commanding figure
always. His make-up, both as miner and as
M.P., is a triumph of drollery, and he is
highly effective in the scene where Bill, the
homespun humorist, figures as a grave
veteran of the wars, exhorting his country-
men to remember the camaraderie of the
trenches. Besides those mentioned, Hicks is
supported, capably enough, by Mione Stew-
art, Emma Temple, Leslie Donaghey, Frank
Hawthorne, Norman Lee and Cyril Gardiner,
but he has the only part that matters.
“Lilac Time” still flowers, in a manner of
speaking, at Sydney Cri. There is no slack-
ening in its dainty musical appeal.

At the New Palace, Sydney, Carter the
Great is handing out stupendous illusions
and urbane patter in equally generous quan-
tities. To turn a guinea-pig into a bunch of
roses or pour a dozen different drinks out
of one bottle is child’s play to Carter; to
saw a really nice girl in halves without hurt-
ing her a scrap is a mere before-breakfast
exercise. Miss Evelyn Maxwell reads minds
and answers questions with the quick discern-
ment and emotionalism expected of prophet-
esses. The entertainment is full of variety
and novelty.

There is no new hlood in this week’s bill
at Sydney Tivoli. Admiral Arthur Prince
is still in command; and Ruth Astor, who
would be an ideal theatrical spare-part and
make managements independent of their most
tyrannical stars, scores well with a new
batch of impersonations. She is just a little
too versatile —from a Muriel Starr climax
to a Cockney sheik-song is an over-long step.
Norman Lindsay gives a show: —
The 14 etchings which he is exhibiting at Gayfield
Shaw’s Attic Gallery, in George-street, emphasise
Norman Lindsay’s confident mastery of this medium,
and in such plates as “The Apex of Life,” a charac-
teristically crowded subject set in an uncannily
luminous atmosphere, his art is seen at its full
strength. He strikes an engagingly new note in “The
Windmill,” and his treatment of “The Pool” is
broader than usual; for the rest his manner and
matter are in the style he has led his public to expect
of him. (Though that public would not now regret
the absence of such gratuitously unedifying subjects
as “The Black Hat.”) Two or three dry-points are
included in the show, and among them “Delight”

stands out for the sheer life of its line and the
soundness of its drawing, a qualitj vhich Lindsay in
his ebullience sometimes allows to lapse. To layman
and artist alike one pf the most interesting items in
the show is a series starting with the original draw-
ing for the fine “The Ragged Poet,” and running up
through the various “states” to the finished etching.
“The Garden of Allah,” which has crossed
over to Melbourne Royal, is poor stuff. Its
lingering attempt to create an atmosphere
in the first two or three scenes is almost as
tedious as the lofty fustian in which the
principals expound their creed of life. The
chatter would be pardonable if it showed a
gleam of original observation, but whether
coming from the worldly lips of young Cap-
tain de Trevignac or issuing in quasi-reli-
gious throbs from the uplifted heroine, it
is stagey to the last degree. Even the long
speech, wherein the fugitive Brother An-
toine relates his amazing spiritual rebound
after 19 years in a Trappist monastery, is
cast on melodramatic lines, and it is only
due to the fine art of Frank Harvey that its
bathos is not fully exposed. On the pictorial
side, however, the play is commendable. The
sandstorm that sweeps over the Sahara, blot-
ting out a night of stars, is a fetching spec-
tacle of murk and wrath, and Count An-
teoni’s garden, where he and his guests
nibble at an Oriental repast, pours all the
changing mysteries of twilight on to a burst
of North African vegetation. Also the camels,
the tall, striding Arabs, the distant muezzin
and the sand-diviner, cleverly impersonated
by J. B. Atholwood, are all details redound-
ing to the minor glory of the producer. Dra-
matically Frank Harvey, as the escaped
monk, is the body and soul of the show.
Muriel Starr comes back to Melbourne in a
part that is a straightjacket for an emotional
actress. Nevertheless she is far from color-
less in her quiet. Kay Souper musters all
his gravity for the job of Count Anteoni, and
Leslie Victor, as a conventional French
priest, ministers his kindly philosophy to
souls distressed. Harvey Adams’s bright
personality suits the small part of Captain
de Trevignac, but a brown stain and a
burnous are not sufficient to disguise John
Fernside, effusively attending Muriel Starr
as the servant, Batouch. Of a number of
other characters, plain and colored, two
maidens, hip-wagging to the snaky music of
an Arab “dive,” are understood to repre-
sent the night life of Beni-Mora. They mean
well, but they are rather sad.

A Darby and Joan show: —
Though Mr. and Mrs. Daryl Lindsay go for the
same results in their show of water-colors at the
Fine Art Society’s Gallery in Melbourne, there is
considerable difference in their performance. The
lady, formerly Joan Weigall, has apparently assimi-
lated her husband’s methods without acquiring his
quality, with the result that most of her work looks
shy and experimental. But a bowl of cosmos is
better handled, and one landscape, “A Quiet Bend,
Warrandyte,” was evidently left just when it
threatened to become a thing of beauty. Daryl
Lindsay is suaver and more confident, but his color
is never entirely satisfying, anl he is not above
attempting an unfair emphasis by outlining objects,
as, for example, the trees in “The Homestead” (No.
23). His finest effects are seen in those narrow
strips of rolling field, with cloudy skies overhead,
which M. J. McNally made popular. In these pictures
McNally revealed himself as a craftsman of singular
cleverness and imagination, and Lindsay will stand
some comparison with his elder. One or two of
his impressions are charming. No. 34 is really,
great. The light stealing over the middle distance
is brilliantly presented.

Good News Indeed!
A new razor built in a less expensive way on
the well-known “VALET” model, with the self-
stropping principle that is now famous through-
out the world, for three and sixpence.
In it is the same service as in the 25/- “VALET”
- —it strops its own blades.
A touch and it springs open ready to be stropped or cleaned. A
few seconds on the strop and its blade has a brand-new edge every
morning—as good to use thirty days hence as it was to-day.
For every shaving reason—for comfort, efficiency, economy
and speed—whether you spend 25/- on the “VALET”
de Luxe, or 3/6 on its more modest brother, you must
shave the “VALET” way.

“Santander”: In my experience of grand
opera I have found the star baritone a more
efficient mummer than the leading tenor or
the bass. Looking no further back than
the Gonsalez Co., I recall that the acknow-
ledged artist of that crew was the head bari-
tone, Scamuzzi. What a character he was,
and what a capacity for mischief lie showed
when he smoked a short clay as Alfio in
“Cavalleria” ! Scamuzzi never failed to im-
part personality to the stodgiest operatic role.
And now, after sorting one’s memories of the
recent season in Melbourne, one has the
strongest recollections of baritone Granforte.
Tenors Piccaluga and Borgioli did very well,
but they are singers rather than actors. Azzo-
lini, on the other hand, is more of a mime
than a singer. The one man who was strik-
ing in both departments was Granforte. He
was dramatically at home in both tragic and
comic parts, and his singing is unimpeach-
able.
“F.L.H.”: “Don F’asquale,” the last of the
.T.C.W. opera productions, had not been done
in Melbourne since 1878, when Amy Sherwin,
the Tasmanian soprano, sang the part of
Norina. In the initial showing, a decade be-
fore, Ida Vitali, Devoti, Bertolini and
Antoni, four Italians imported by Lyster to
strengthen the Eseott-Squires combination,
were prominent; Verdi’s “Un Ballo in Mas-
ehera” was also presented that season. “Don
I’asquale” had three or four repetitions in
the early ’seventies, Grandi, the comic basso,
carrying off the honors with a superb imper-
sonation of Pasquale.
“F.L.H.”: According to a U.S.A. musical
magazine soprano De Vere Sapio, whose
Lucia and Gilda were operatic features here
20 years ago, is teaching in New York along
with her husband, Romualdo. They first
appeared in Australia just 30 years back,
and their concerts, with violiniste Camilla
Urso and an orchestra of 40. are still agree-
ably remembered by old-timers, who haven’t
got used to the contemporary concert-
promoter’s habit of hiring a pianist, or a
tenor and a fiddler with an accomplice at the
ivories, to supply the whole show. Weston,
who led the orchestra, was with us till last
year; Urso’s music ceased in 1902.
“H.S.’s” advice to travelling stars:—
The ancient theatrical tradition which governs
the off-stage relations between Hamlet and Ophelia
will have to be revised as regards Australia. It has
been found that the best publicity is to be got from
the domestic touch. Let the student of the boards
gc back, say, ten years, and consider the eminent
artists who have come here in that time without
their wives or husbands, as the case may be, and he
will find that hardly one of them had a satisfactory
spin. An explanation is that it takes a deal of
social influence these days to persuade Government
House to overlook infractions of the moral code by
stage performers; and there is a certain unwilling-
ness to extend the hand of advertised friendship
even where mere suspicions of irregularity exist. The
approval of Government House means a lot more
than a bald notice or two that “Mr. and Mrs. Foot-
lights (Miss Muriel Grease-Paint) had the honor of
lunching with their Excellencies at the races.” It
causes the favored pair to be rushed by every social
climber in the city—in Presbyterian Melbourne in
particular—with the result that they get thousands
of pounds’ worth of free advertising in the news
columns of the papers that theatregoers most patro-
nise. If developments continue as at present the
first two proofs of competence that an entrepreneur
engaged in booking stars for Australia will require
of his quarry will be the latter’s marriage-lines and
a certificate from their local police-sergeant that to
the best of his belief they live together. .
“Norbell”: I broke the pledge this week
and went on a pitcher jag. I saw Gloria
Swanson in “The Humming Bird,” and was
interested to find our old friend Mario Maj-
eroni in a leading part. Then I saw Mary
Pickford in “Rosita,” and there was Charles
Belcher in the “second lead.” Charlie used
to be property-man under Rock Phillips for
George Rignold at Sydney Majesty’s. He
played parts occasionally, too, the industrial
crime of “intermingling” not having been
invented in those far-off days. Later we fore-
gathered in Alfred DampieFs co., and still
later we toured Australasia together with
William F. Ilawtrey’s “Message from Mars”
co. A good chap, and an excellent actor,
his weak voice kept him back in the spoken
drama. He finds his metier in the movies.
I’m only sorry he had to go to the land of
the Bar-Strangled Banner to do it.
“Hambone”: In 1923, according to the
U.S. Department of Commerce, the Animated
States sent out 148,434,916 ft. of exposed
film. Australia took 19,377,439 ft., which
was 1,909,705 more than was distributed
among 10 European countries—Belgium,
Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, Germany, Holland and Spain.
Britain bought 13,490,193 ft., Argentina
14,312,144 ft. and Canada 17,529,190 ft. In
effect, Australia imports more Hollywood
muck than any other country in the world.
It is a distinction of which no nation that
values its reputation for taste and intelli-
gence will seek to deprive us.
“A.P.”: Ristori’s Melbourne season (B.
12/6/’24 ) began at the Opera House on Aug.
28, 1875. “Medea” was played then, but at
a subsequent benefit a gloomy tragedy, “Pia
de Tolemei,” was staged, in addition to the
sleep-walking scene from “Macbeth.” In that
she wore just a nightdress and spoke in
English—very good English, too. Harwood
played the doctor.
A DIRTY
TRICK.
THE ARTIST:
“When I am
dead those
sketches will he
worth hundreds
of pounds. Yet
here I am starv-
ing to death.”
Cohen : “Yes, and if I lent you five hot on
’em you’d go and eat and save yourself."
“Exile”: Two new plays (two, and no
more) were produced in New York on April
22. In each case a young Australian actress
headed the cast —an event without precedent,
surely. In “Cobra,” described as a gripping
melodrama, Judith Anderson plays the
heroine; in “Time Is a Dream,” which deals
with the Einstein theory, Esther Mitchell is
the sensitive visionary overcome by Fate.
Both girls were plenteously praised for their
work.
A lawyer at the play:—
What a welter of impossibilities—not thrown at
you as in melodrama, but underlying—is “Smilin’
Through” ! One sees merely Carteret living in an
old garden, and frowning on the affection of his
ward Kathleen for young Wayne, and learns later
that just half a century ago her aunt, Carteret's
bride-to-be, was shot dead on her wedding day by
Jerry Wayne, the father. The breaking down of
the old man’s hatred and the pathetic appearances
to him of the departed spirit put cold reason to
sleep. But when one gets away and thinks it over
these desperate propositions marshal themselves: (1)
Carteret’s home is the old home of his fiancee; (2)
he is sole guardian to Kathleen, who is no relation
of his; (3) she, living on the exact scene of the
murder, has never heard of it; (4) with •50 years
gone, Jerry Wayne’s only son is about 24. As an
honest advocate, I must admit that some sort of
an answer might be faked for each point so far, but
—(5) nothing was ever done to Jerry Wayne for
murder; (6) his son, coming from foreign parts, ins
lived on the scene for a year without learning why
his name might be unpopular with Carteret; (7)
Kathleen, only child of the murdered girl’s sister
(also about to be married in 1864), is 20 or so in
1914 ; (S) a wedding was taking place, in the England
of 1864, at a private house and in the evening. This
last, sheer absurdity must be due to the play's
American origin, otherwise carefully suppressed.
BEAR TO HIS HEART.
“I’m surprised at you applauding that old
chestnut."
“Can’t help it—force of habit.”
“A.P.”: In a Melbourne flicker-show the
other night I spotted Ercole Ortori in the
orchestra. Ortori came here 45 years ago
and fiddled on many a concert platform. He
supported the late Madame Charbonnet-Kel-
lerman at her first appearance in 1879, and
other notabilities he appeared with were Miss
Christian, Mi's. Cutter and Elmblad, the
Swedish basso. After a long absence he is
teaching in Melbourne and showing 'the
youngsters how Vieuxtemps and the old
school plied the bow.
“Geo Rich”: Small touring companies
which used to depend on the railways are
now getting round in motor-trucks. In the
course of two months three well-known
troupes have pip-pipped past my lonely look-
out in South Groperland. The boss of one
outfit, who stopped to repair a puncture, told
me he found the petrol waggon cheap -r and
more convenient that the train. “We haven’t
to hire carriers,” he explained, “or hang
round pubs waiting till 3 g.m. for the mid-
night express.”
“Tino”: “D.W.” (B. 22/5/’24), in men-
tioning the crudities and errors of construc-
tion in Chaplin’s “A Woman of Paris,” over-
looked those Parisian taxi-cabs. Their num-
ber-plates all bore the initials L.A., short for
Los Angeles. Again, France could be ran-
sacked from north to south without finding
in a village home the modern Yankee tele-
phone-set on which the girl rings up her
first lover. There is only one character with
the real French touch —Menjou, the wealthy
bachelor; the other players have Pawtucket
and Poughkeepsie written all over their hard
“dials.” As for the heroine and her at-
tempts to portray Gallic vivacity and charm
—Lawdelpus!
“Stage Wait”: Recent happenings at the
King’s, Melbourne, recall the unfortunate
occurrence in Adelaide a few weeks ago,
when the Asche company was suddenly
thrown out of work —and the tour abandoned
—owing, it is alleged, to certain misguided
importations (since deported), assisted by
Oscar Rash, employing “direct action” to-
wards the Firm. In the latest turmoil, be-
fore the climax on June 13. Oscar threatened
an injunction against the Firm for using his
“production.” Immediately another “produc-
tion” was got together—dresses, props, and
scenery—a unique experience in theatrical
history. So the curtain went up as usual,
and the actors were not thrown out of work. •
Only one of the cast did not choose to stick.
But with more experience she may learn
better sense.
“Lex” : The producers of “Flaming Youth”
—the film which was accused of “brutal in-
delicacy” by Archbishop Duhig—gave a pri-
vate screening of it last week to satisfy a
section of the press that the thing had been
maligned. But no charges made by anyone
were half so lurid as those embodied in the
advts. published by some of the papers whose
representatives went to see Duhig proved “a
slanderer of honorable business men.” F'rin-
stance:—
lf> ( Screen Sensation of the Year, “Flaming Youth"
other book you carry in a brown-paper parcel
Whoops m’dear, who cares? Hush! We’ll give
I*" i ust ' on e glimpse of the naughty midnight
bathing party ! 6
One of the evening papers printed about half a
page of provocative vulgarity on these lines.
\Y hat it amounts to, then, is this: either
the picture is all the Archbishop said it was,
or the exhibitors are getting money by
lalse pretences. They can’t have it both
ways.
“Second Murderer": Touching Allan Wil-
kie s thousandth performance of Shakspeare,
played without any baser dramatic alloy,
Augustus Neville deserves a hoy, too. lie
played in every one of the thousand.
- ® Ghost”: “Sweetie,” who figured
in ‘The Garden of Allah,” and was a col-
league of Oscar Asche in “Chu Chin Chow,”
finished his contract recently and was carted
to the bonemill. But the joy of his fellow-
mummers at getting rid of him is damped
by the knowledge that a new camel is to
take his place. “Sweetie” was a picturesque
beast, but his habits were unpleasant; still,
I suppose he earned his provender. Drome-
daries first shuffled across the Australian
stage, in the .T.C.W. production of “Ben
Hur.” Asche has a weakness for introduc-
ing animals into his plays; so had Bland
Holt; ana Charles Arnold’s Newfoundland
dog was as noted a figure in his day as
the horse that George Rignold bestrode in
‘Henry V.” But I have never heard of any
Australian manager embellishing his show
with an elephant.
“Orb”: That reference to Oscar Wilde
(B. 19/6/’24) recalls someone’s discovery (if
it was a discovery) that the family’s real
name was O’Flaherty. Jimmie Glover
tells in his book of a song sung in “The
Poet and the Puppets,” a burlesque on “Lady
Windermere’s Fan.” One verse ran:—
They m->v bobble with jest at the way that I’m
dressed,
They may scoff at the length of my hjfir,
They may say that I’m vain, overbearing, inane,
And object to the flowers that I wear.
They me- laugh till they’re ill, but the fact remains
still,
A fact l’ve proclaimed since a child,
That it’s taken, my dears, nearly two thousand years
To make Oscar O’Flaherty Wilde.
“Val D.” : “J.N.” (B. 5/6/’24) says Emily
Soldene played in “La Sonnambula” at the
Opera House, Melbourne, during ’75 or ’76.
He must be thinking of some other Emily.
Soldene landed in Sydney during September,
1877, and sailed from Melbourne for London
aboard the Chimborazo on May 27, 1878.
-During the intervening months she played
lead in her own company. Emily did not
visit Australia again until July. 1892. settling
in Sydney until July, 1895. “J.N.” owes a
humble apology to “A.P.”
“T. 0.1.”: From the estate of my late
brother I have received several volumes of
playbills, some dating back to the ’sixties.
One is of particular interest. The Mel-
bourne newspaper-men of the period gave an
amateur dramatic performance in aid of
the widow of W. M. A khurst,, a pressman,
who, on leaving for England after some
years in Victoria, had to his credit 30
burlesques, farces and pantomimes. Setting
out again for Melbourne in the ship Badajoz
he died of paralysis of the brain, off the
coast of Africa, and was buried at sea, June
6, 1878. The plays selected for the benefit
were “The Rivals” and “An Actor Out of
luck.” In the former were Whitworth,
Walstab, Edmund Finn (Sir Lucius O’Trig-
ger), Massina, Jos. Brown, Fenton, Rider,
McWhirter and Hollyford. Lydia Languish
was played by Rose Edouin (Mrs.
G. B. W. Lewis), the last of the Edouin
family, and now living in England. In the
farce Jos. Pickersgill, a noted man about
town—Richard Goldsbrough, the wool king,
left him a legacy of £2OO a year so that
he should not want—was Sylvester Dagger-
wood.
“Dido”: Sympathy with the crook attains
the limit in “The Crooked Alley,” a U.S.
film that has reached us. The story tells
of a domineering wretch of a State Gover-
nor who hard-heartedly refuses to liberate
a dying yegg man—a criminal of sorts. Be-
cause he allows the good old thief and spieler
to die in prison, the yegg’s virtuous daugh-
ter conspires with a member of dad’s old
crook gang to ruin the Governor’s son by
luring him into the lady’s toils, and then in-
ducing him to rob a safe. The criminals
throughout have the sympathy of the author,
and such of the audience, of course, as have
not learned discrimination. When they are
not garrotting a simple citizen, or taking
down a mug with a gold brick, they are cast-
ing benignant attitudes about an angelic old
lady who is their good angel, and whom the
crooks call “mommer.” The story ends hap-
pily for the daughter of the addled yegg and
the Governor’s son, and the Governor, de-
lighted to find that his heir is about to marry
into the criminal classes, invites all the crooks
to come and live with him, to soften his hard
heart. Never have I seen standard morality
tumbled head over heels so recklessly.
THE SCENE-SHIFTER’S STORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now gather around the bar, my lads,
An’ I’ll tell you a painful tale —
A tale as 'll make yer blood run cold,
And yer brows turn sickly pale.
It deals with a blow that was struck by Fate
At one who in every sense was great.
La Belle Colosse was our star that year,
An’ she loved to put on “Boheme” ;
Her Minii from Cairns to far Cathay
Had won her no end of fame.
The public were wont to go barmy clean
When she starved and shrieked in the garret scene.
I had to shove up a wall O.P.
In the room where the famished band
Complained in song of the wine and food
That they couldn’t find in the land.
(’Twould ’ave broke yer heart to ’ave seen La Belle
Contending with ’Unger’s orful spell.)
Her song was done, and consumptive, frail,
She Staggered and threatened to swoon.
And now it was that disaster came,
As I shall reveal to you soon:
She staggered, 1 say, and —eyqs closed, head bent—
On my wall ’er twenty-stone-odd she leant!
It never rains, so the proverb says,
But what it don’t also pour,
An’ so it was with La Belle Colosse —
She fell, and went slap through the floor.
Yes ; the stoutest soprano of the age
Crashed, wall and all, through that rotten old
stage!
They never punish the great, my lads!
She wasn’t rebuked for ’er weight.
They didn’t say she shouldn’t have got
Into such an adipose state,
Or —failing such conduct as fatness stops—
Have avoided leaning on frail stage “props.”
Not they! They put all the blame on me
As ’adn’t offended at all,
And so did she (I can ’ear ’er now)
When she come to after ’er fall.
“Get out! ” she yelled at me, greatly annoyed.
And that’s how 1 come to be unemployed! ”

CAN YOU DRAW?
You may think you can’t, but really
you can, for if you can write you can
draw; the same principles apply in
each. With the thorough tuition you
receive from the Weston Course, there
is no reason why you should not in-
stantly dash off free, bold sketches
similar to the one above.
THE HARRY J. WESTON
Postal School of Drawing
takes yon step by step from the rudiments of
sketching to the highest branches of art.
The lessons are simple, interesting and effi-
cient.
Remember, we teach to DRAW not to COPY.
Learn more about the Course! Post three
stamps with your name and address, and you
will receive a copy of Mr. Webton’s interest-
ing Booklet—“ There’s Money in the Pen”;
it explains all about the Course.

Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
H.E.G.: Interesting, but doesn’t suggest
much that the original article didn’t.... Civis: Don't
write in riddles. When you’ve established yourself
as a genius, people will chase your meaning. Until
then you will have to deliver it plainly into their
hands F.T.M. : Too late Wandella: “He had
even been in Sydney.” This suggestion that Aus-
tralia ought to be surprised and very grateful when
anybody it deserves a large, heavy brick....
Rococo: Put it in 10 lines 0.K.M.: Good item—
if you’d mentioned where showmen were liable to
that fine... .A.E.W.; Let them have the ring to
themselves Woodnead : But the U.S. plan is to
divorce the State power from the great cities. The
capital of New York State isn’t N. York, or Buffalo,
but Albany (113,344). Of Illinois, Springfield
(59,183) is the State capital, not Chicago. Even
in States like New Hampshire, where there is no
town of 80,000 people, the capital is something
with still less pull—Concord (22,167) Mombak :
“Help, Brothers, Help!” has a genuinely tragic note!
Middle-aged she was, she’d lost her bloom,
In dark years to come old age did loom.
“Living is going up.” She listened to the rumors,
And foolishly she stole three pairs of bloomers.
She could not have resisted if she would
Temptation strong, for the garments seemed so good;
And as she pondered o’er the matter she found
Herself stealing them, without a sound.
Silently, I said; but some cursPd minion of the law,
W ith eagle eyes her deadly trespass saw;
One silent step ere the awful evidence was hidden
She found herself before a police court bidden.
Next day, the third, I think, was the date,
Unwillingly she was arraigned before a magistrate.
“Two pounds,” he said, “I’ll fine you: the costs are
fifteen bob.
Fourteen days to pay.” She gave a silent sob.
Dear Bulletin, consider, how very sad her case,
And in your generous columns give a little space;
Winter is coining with nights so cold and drear.
Start a fund, I pray you, for ladies’ underwear.
J.B.W.; A man with the aid of glasses saw a
cat! Well, we 11!... .H.E.L.R.: Not for u 5....
Buzz; Indifferent imitation of a well-known writer's
work... .G.M.8.; They miss, but not by much....
Enid H.: “Home” doesn’t get near it....E.M.E.: Not
well enough upholstered... .G.W. (Glebe): Botn
miss... .C.W.: “On the Other Hand” fell at the post.
Bettie R.: One still has a sporting chance....
R.T.K.: Both are a bit too rough... .R.D.F.: The
verse isn’t strong enough to carry “Calm”....
Mariette: Doesn’t strike us hard enough... .Cork-
screw: It goes stumping along, with a special bang
to indicate each rhyme... .Nemo: It hasn’t the
touch. .. .Aboriginal: Verse of the worst sort....
George W.: Had to keep the alarm-clock going all
through the reading of it.... Takurua: “Myth” fails.
.... Esperance Bay: Commonplace, and it is hideous
verse. .. .Nclle T.: Falls far short... .J.H.8.; No
thrill in it ... . Auto-S.: The verse is so rocky that
we wore out a pair of boots tramping through it....
Rikki T.: Not up Ronnie . G.: Doesn t move us.
....Ted B.; First get a yam to tell; and then
write it as simply and. directly as you can... .G.R.V.:
Shocking... .S.R. (Elsternwick) ; Regret to say that
it’s rubbish... .F.D. (Jolimont) : No g00d....K.C.:
This is a poor market for that kind of g00d5....
W.S.H.: Why drag the tale along by the hair in
that dull fashion?... .F.S.S.: Doesn’t get near enough
to coo-ee.... Csesar: Crude stuff... .R.M.C.: Aim at
sincerity. Don’t sacrifice that for anything....
Deni; You’ll have to learn more about the English
language before you c: n use it effectively in that
verse form.... Hare Hongi: Topical verse must be
better than that.... George G.: Infantile prattle done
woodenly... .Phelps; Don't know what it’s all about.
....Galen: Too weak to live.... Gus A.: Poor
attempts.... E.H.F.: The nursery rhyme is bad;
the others have some quality, but need more work.
. ...V.K.T.: A bit commonplace and gets too often
out of tune... .E.L.P.: The worst sort of picture-

Girls! Beautify
your Hair.
Do you know that in less than ten minutes you can double
the beauty of your hair? It becomes light, wavy, fluffy, abundant
and appears as soft, lustrous and charming as anyone could desire,
after a simple wash with Rexona Soap. A delightful surprise
awaits those whose hair has been neglected, or is scraggy, dry, brittle
or thin. Rexona Soap cleanses the hair of all dust, dirt or excess
oil, and in a few moments you have doubled the beauty of your
hair. Rexona Soap dissolves every particle of dandruff, cleanses,
purifies and invigorates the scalp, for ever stopping itching and
falling hair. If you care to have pretty hair and lots of it, get a
tablet of Rexona Soap to-day.
Why Not Enjoy a
Good Complexion?
You cannot if you do not care for the delicate skin of the face.
When you wash your face, do you realise that it is not enough to
simply remove the dirt, but that your skin needs a soothing, healing
influence to keep your complexion fresh and free from blemish?
Scented toilet soaps are often very pleasant, but do not assert this
influence, as you are well aware. Many of them contain free alkali,
which tends to dry up the skin and destroy its delicate texture.
Even the better class of such soaps do not in any way help
to improve the skin, but Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is not only
an absolutely pure soap, but is medicated on the same principle as
the famous Rexona Ointment, which is famous throughout all of
Australasia as the Rapid Healer. . That is why Rexona Soap really
does for the skin and face what cosmetics are supposed to do, by
ensuring not only a clean face, but a pure and healthy skin and
thus gives you a clear complexion.
“Rexona Soap is worth its
weight in gold for the skin and
hair.” i

From the Acting Director:—
The N.S.W. Government Tourist Bureau is glad of
the opportunity “Thersites'’ offers it to state that
the illustrated book, “Pleasure Resorts of Sydney,”
printed in Prussia, is handled not by the Bureau’s
officers, but at the Photo Kiosk at Ofiallis House.
The publication was ordered and printed before the
war, but was delivered to distributors only this year.
*•* * •
“Jumbuck”: In “The Banking Burden”
(B. 5/6/’24) an alcountant, dealing with
wool-drafts on London, states that “the re-
moval of the wool from the sheep’s back
costs about -Id. per £l.” I would like to
point out that, under present Queens-
land award rates (40s. per 100), it costs
4.80 d. per head to divest flock sheep—ewes
or lambs—of their jackets. On a 7ilb. clip
the wool would require to average 32d. per
lb. in the grease to return £1 per head gross.
How many pastoralists’ books show this
weight, cut or per head revenue?
* * * *
“ Jan-Os” : Lawyers’ costs may be taxed,
but is there no limit to what a "doctor may
charge a private patient? An ailing friend
(lady) consulted a Macquarie-street practi-
tioner and was told that an abdominal X-ray
photo would cost five guineas. Unable to afford
this fee the lady went to a suburban hospi-
tal. There the X-ray apparatus happened
to be on the casualty list at the moment, but
she was given an introduction to a Macquaric-
street doctor who, when the hospital appara-
tus is out of order, does the hospital work
at the hospital rates —in this case 10s. 6d.
And so it came about that the patient was
duly X-rayed for half a guinea—by the very
operator who had required five guineas in
his private practice.
# * * #
“Borom”: The reason why ambergris is
quoted at so low a price (B. 29/5/’24) is
that synthetic chemistry can produce the
stuff for one-tenth the cost of the natural
substance. The same thing has happened
with many other natural products such as
perfuming and flavoring essences and vege-
table dyes. The analytical chemist discovered
that most fruit flavoring-essences are simply
compounds of a primary alcohol and an acid,
joined together in Nature’s laboratory, and
that they can be much more cheaply produced
in factories; the same applies to dyes for-
merly obtained from plants. It is quite pos-
sible, too, that artificially-made silk will in a
few years entirely drive off the market that
made by the silkworm.
* * * *
“Ike Hollar”: Another point in the “equal
pay for equal work” campaign has been
scored by woman in Victoria. Two girl
clerks employed by the Camberwell Munici-
pal Council at 355. per week were dispensed
with, and immediately claimed the difference
between the wages they had received and the
rate which the award says should be paid
for clerical work of the kind they were doing
—£4 per week. The award made no special
provision for women, so the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court had to take it for granted
that the rates applied all round, and
the girls will divide £479 of arrears between
them. But what is meant by “equal work”
still remains to be decided.
“H.K.”: A new 500-tou vehicle punt, with
a speed of knots and capable of accommo-
dating 70-odd motor-cars, has been ordered
by Sydney Ferries, Ltd., from Leith, Scot-
land. It is a far cry to 1842, when this form
of harbor transport was represented by one
wooden steam-punt, built for the North Shore
Ferry Co., and named the Princess. It was
intended for both vehicular and passenger
traffic, and a 20-h.p. engine had been im-
ported to propel it. It plied from dawn to
dusk between Windmill-street and North
Shore, carrying passengers for 3d. and
vehicles for 2s. 6d. But its career was brief;
and when the craft was broken up in 1844,
the hull, originally costing £l3OO, was sold
for £6O. The engine, installed at a cost of
£lBOO, realised only £275, being acquired to
drive a steam flour-mill at East Maitland.
* * * *
“Herodot” : Among queer diving accidents
is this beatable? An American cargo-ship
ran on a reef among the Islands, and "subse-
quently sank in about 20 fathoms. There
was gold in her strong-room, and other valu-
able cargo that looked recoverable; wherefore
an expedition, with a couple of divers, was
despatched from ’Frisco to the wreck. On
the second day of operations one of the
divers was being lowered to join his mate,
already busy on the deck of the sunken ship.
The second man did not arrive, however, and
when the other diver could find no signs of
him he signalled to be hauled up. Subse-
quently it was found that the missing man
had been lowered into the funnel, and had
gone down almost into the fire-box. His
signal-rope having fouled, and the air-pipe
becoming entangled, he suffocated miserably.
“Thersites”: For reasons of my own I
want to cash my Gratuity Bond, now that
the time is ripe. So I made for the nearest
p.o. last month, and filled in an application-
form. A week later I got this, printed on an
open postcard:—
Commonwealth Sub-Treasury,
, r , Sydnev,
vl emorandum. 31 /5/ * 2 4
Your application for the cashing of your War
Giatuity Bond on the 31st May, together with the
Bond, has been received, and is being attended to.
R. W. Hamtltok.
Registrar of War Gratuity Bonds.
Of course, everyone in the warehouse, from
the liftman to the boss’s pet typist, read if
before I did. The fatherly old accountant
asked me if I was in financial, difficulties,
and advised me to tell all. I was just getting
used to the ledgerkeeper’s nasty insinuations
when this came to light, also printed on a
postcard:—
Commonwealth Sub-Treasury,
, Brisbane,
Memorandum. 5 j une> 1924 _
lour application for the cashing of vour War
Gratuity Bond on 31st May, 1924, together with
the Bond, has been received, and is being attended to.
J. Brophy,
Registrar of War Gratuity Bonds.
The boss called me in to-day and wanted to
know if I was leading a double life. And
yet, when I was qualifying for that Gratuity
Bond, the brass-hats would only allow me to
date my sealed letters from “Somewhere,”
But I am hopeful: when I hear from the
other States and Papua the letters may be
in envelopes.

“Axholme”: One Oscar Winkler, picking
wine grapes for the Stanley Wine Co., Clare
(S.A.), tilled 103 petrol cases within eight
hours. Can any grape snatcher on the Vic-
torian side show a bigger tally?
Albert Mullett, Commonwealth and State
Government printer (Melbourne), who is re-
tiring on June 30, is taking send-offs from
friends in the Federal and Vic. services. He
has a big orchard at Healesville to supervise,
and will drop in once a month at the shire
council to help 11 others run local affairs.
The ancient fetich that every Chinaman is
a model of industry got sadly fractured at
Parkes (N.S.W.) the other day. The dis-
colored alien, by name Ah Hong, collected six
months from an indignant Beak when it was
proved that he had steadily refused to tackle
any sort of toil for 30 years!
“V.8.H.” : Queer accidents are still piling
up. At Midland Junction (W.A.) a little
while back a railway callboy was sent with
a message to an engine-driver, and when
sprinting on the verandah a meathook, on
which a birdcage usually hung, caught him
in the throat and suspended him. He was
discovered unconscious, and treated only just
in time.
“Derf Commor”: Mulgrave mill (N.Q.)
commenced cane-crushing operations on June
4. Last year this mill treated 138,864 tons,
from which sugar valued at £500,000 was
squeezed. This season the available crop
is estimated at 173,000 tons. With new
land being taken up each year for cane-
growing, North Queensland is fast ceasing to
be one of Australia’s empty spaces.
“Sinexate”: A thief who must wonder
whether the game is worth thq candle was
fined £ll 10s. in a Sydney court the other
day for stealing a stump of lead pencil. It
was all the booty he secured during a hurried
raid on another man’s waistcoat-pocket. But
some comparatively recent transgressors have
fared even worse; one was a pickpocket who
was caught as he dashed away from his vic-
tim with a packet of cigarette-papers.
“Pick”: On the northern bank of the
Cudgegong River (N.S.W.) a unique indus-
try has been established that turns in many
a shekel for its enterprising proprietor. He
runs a worm farm for the cod-fishers of the
western river. Over an extensive, well-
soiled flat, which he keeps well irrigated, are
spread hundreds of damp corn-bags. A few
inches below the ground surface under the
bags the worm mobs are rounded up by the
billyful whenever a patron applies for "fish-
bait.
“Sturt”: Owen Smyth, who has returned
to Adelaide to end his days after trying
England first, is giving to the Register his
memories of the 40 years he spent as' a genial
autocrat and adviser-in-general to Governors
and Governments in S.A. His best yarn to
date is of the son of a member of Parliament
who was made a mounted trooper, and came
into Port Lincoln with a prisoner from out
back, by coach. The trooper was without
his belt, and very sozzled; but the prisoner,
“a quiet-looking man,” duly delivered himself
and his alleged captor at the police-station.
“Pantagruel”: There is an ill-fated spot at
Dalma (C.Q.). A Dane named Charlie
Trolson settled there, building a house and
dairy. His eldest child was drowned in a
creek near the homestead; after this tragedy
the house was shifted to a spot a few
hundred yards away. Then one day Trol-
son, helped by his wife, was yarding some
horses, when they got away and raced over
the woman, killing her. He" married again,
and a few years later met his death at the
same place and in exactly the same way.
Father, mother and eldest child lie buried
together.
“H.K.”: Sydney’s first street-lamp shone
in that historic thoroughfare, Macquarie-
place, on the night of April 7, 1826. In
March of the following year one John White,
of George-street, successfully tendered for
the supply of oil and wicks and 100 lamps.
He further offered to keep them lighted every
night from half an hour after sunset until
sunrise next morning for £346 per annum.
When the first City Council took over
in 1843 the total number of public lamps in
Sydney numbered but 76, of which 51 were
oil and 25 gas—the latter having been first
used for street lighting on May 25, 1841.
“P.P.”: That even the tidiest and most
methodical person may mislay his relatives
was shown in the case of a patient, one John
Owen, who died in Sydney Hospital the other
day. When his room in Darlinghurst was
visited in the hope of finding some particu-
lars about the deceased, they found his birth
certificate, showing that he was 78, his pur-
chased discharge from the Army dated 1866,
an album full of old-fashioned photographs
and a number of other papers, all systemati-
cally kept, but no word about any possible
relatives. Yet the ancient left nearly £1260
for any claimants who may come forward.
“Harold Hardupp” : The march of progress
has reached Bathurst-street, the sometime
Petticoat-lane of Sydney. _ For years, while
big buildings and brisk businesses were grow-
ing up all around it, the thoroughfare itself re-
mained untouched, the only alterations being
new shop-fronts let into old buildings. When
the Worker and the A.W.U: first came to
Sydney they found the cheapest land avail-
able in this street, and made their habitation
therein; but paper and union have moved
out. The street is the home of the Jewish
second-hand dealers, at least two of whom
have amassed great wealth there. Now,
however, a number of the dealers have been
given notice to quit, and their ramshackle
buildings are to make room for something
modern.
An Adelaide jury has for once found no
reason to recommend a convicted murderer
to mercy on account of youthfulness, un-
balanced mind or anything else. Hori George
Arthur Morse described himself in the dock
as born in Wanganui (M.L.), 27 and single.
In 1914, at the age of 17, he enlisted in the
Expeditionary force, and went straight into
camp from school. After the war he joined
the Irish Constabulary. Coming to Aus-
tralia with a Mrs. Hunter, whose husband
had left her, he lived at Manly, Bondi, Pad-
dington, Darlinghurst, and “in a tent at Kal-
lara, 150 miles from Bourke, shearing.” Last
February she left him. He found out by
wireless what vessel she was on, went across
to Adelaide by train, and shot her dead as
soon as she landed on the wharf at the
Outer Harbor.

“I have been a master hairdresser in Sydney for
the past 35 years, and during that time have tried
many shaving soaps, with a view of discovering one
suitable for use in my saloon, and after giving the
Rexona Triangular Shaving Stick a trial, great was
my surprise to find I had at last secured a suitable
soap, one which has given entire
satisfaction. It lathers excel-
lently and softens the beard
Ijetter than other soaps I have
used, and at the same time it
leaves the face free from all
irritation.
“I have always been a great
advocate for Rexona Tri-
angular Shaving Stick, as
I realise that it has no
equal, both for preserving
the skin and its economi-
cal value.
“I will recommend
Rexona Shaving Soap to
my friends and customers,
well knowing that they
will be rewarded after a
trial.”

Rexona Shaving Soap—
The Triangular SticK.
Rexona Shaving Soap will be found the most economical Shaving Stick on the
market but care should be exercised not to dip the Stick in the water, but wet
the face and apply the Shaving Soap dry. A few applications with the shaving brush
will Quickly produce a thick, creamy lather, which lasts and thoroughly softens the
beard, leaving the skin in a healthy and hygienic condition after the shave.
Everyone should use a Medicated Soap for shaving, for,
after going; over the face with the razor and removing the
beard, the skin needs a protection from the germs carried
by the dust which everyone has to face.

Getting Back.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT the sound of the ship’s anchoring
Prestidge ran eagerly on deck to
survey his old station. It was the
same dear old place. Dear old place! That
was an epithet he would never have dared
to apply to it in the hearing of any of the
company’s messes. How they would have
chaffed him for it! All the same, he had
always had a sneaking affection for Banyu-
wangi. It had been his first foreign station,
his first glimpse of “the romantic East.” He
had put in four years at it, and when he
had been transferred back to Australia he
had left it with a certain amount of senti-
mental regret. He had thought constantly
of ft since, and in the course of time had
gradually forgotten its inadequacies and re-
membered only its glamor and romance. In
the prosaic setting of his later service in the
temperate South it had gleamed like a magni-
ficent jewel which he had kept hidden in the
secret recesses of his soul.
And now, after fifteen years, here he was
again. Although his firm had sent him on a
mission back to the East, he had never
expected to reach Banyuwangi. It was too
far out of his route for his presence there
to be reasonably explained, and he was too
shy of his precious jewel to wish to expose
it to the gaze of scoffers. It was mere
chance that the little boat which dawdled
round the coast of Bali, picking up pigs for
Java, should have been in port at Buleleng
at the same time as the direct mail, and
that on its way to Surabaya it should be
calling in at the very place he most wanted
to get to. He would get off and have a look
at Banyuwangi while the steamer was in
port; but he would be careful not to go
near the Presyn girl.
Prestidge discovered to his surprise that
his body was trembling inside his starched
white suit.
“It is now 1 o’clock,” the captain warned
him. “I stay but two hours. You shall
be on board at 3 o’clock already, yes!”
Prestidge hardly heard him. He ran down
the gangway and got into the sampan. The
brown faces of the rowers were in front of
him. A brand-new jetty poked its thin legs
into the sea, but he made them take him to
the old “boom,” where he had first landed in
all the ardor of his splendid youth. The
long white coral road to the town blazed in
the mid-day stm before him. He stepped out
briskly, avoiding the pleading eyes of a
c/w7c«r-driver huddled with his dilapidated
vehicle and his rat of a pony in the shade of
a solitary chemara- tree. He chuckled when
he heard the chikar-driver stir up his steed
and come rumbling after him. Everything
was just the same! He would walk a few
hundred yards and then, of course, succumb
to the heat and the enticing murmurs of the
man. On his left were three black oil-tanks
with “Bataviaasche Petroleum Maatschap-
pij” printed in huge white letters across
them. New since his time. He repeated
the words to himself, and there seemed to
be something subtly allusive even in those
uncouth syllables. He paused at the old
bridge to look again at Kampong Melayu.
He had always liked that malodorous vil-
lage, because its inhabitants were aliens like
himself. There was nothing new in it,
thank goodness, except the high-roofed
mosque which did not offend the land-
scape. The djukongs had finished fish-
ing early, and were gliding in on
the last breath of the sea breeze, their
twin outriggers clipping the little waves
lightly, like dancers’ heels. He watched,
over a bank of smooth and gleaming sand,
their tall triangular sails nod across the
bar, watched them run swiftly along the
narrow channel and sweep across the
enamelled surface of the lagoon up the slop-
ing beach. A barking of dogs and a rush
of naked children and women gay as parrots
greeted each fresh arrival. Above the red
roofs of the kampong and the line of starry
cocoanut-trees, the mountain chain slowly
unveiled itself. His three lady mountains
—Merapi, Rantei and the Raoen! For his
delight alone they were exposing the con-
tours of their lovely flanks, which, at this
time of the wet monsoon, should have lain
packed- in clouds from dawn to dusk. It
was all most noble. He could have nearly
wept, and no longer could he resist the
pleading eyes of the chikar-dtiyer who had
halted almost in his shadow, patiently to
await the conclusion of his reverie.
He climbed into the crazy cart and rattled
half a mile into the settlement, getting
down again on the edge of the aloon-aloon,
He started walking round the great green
square fringed with stately trees. Every-
thing was most beautifully the same. There
was the regent’s “palace” with a few of his
retainers dozing in the gateway, through
which he could see the numerous pillars of
pendoppos, and natives crouching, squatting
or drifting about them. There, too, on the
other side of the sauare was the Resident’s
kantoor, plain, businesslike in appearance,
shut up for the noonday siesta. There was
the little club where he had drunk gin -pahits
till 3 in the morning, and the hotel where
he had had his birthday sprees with his
messmates. There was the old Dutch fort
embowered in ancient trees, but with its
high embankment removed and the mos-
quito-breeding moat filled in.
He wondered if the malaria was as bad
now as it was in the days when he was
stationed here. He passed some children
playing in the shade, white children and
near-whites, watched over by a regiment of
natives nurses. The children’s skins gleamed
in the shade with an unearthly pallor as if
in this land of everlasting sunshine their
bodies had never been allowed to feel the sum
There were dark pouches under their eyes
and their play seemed listless. He watched
one little autocrat kicking his native nurse.
Thank goodness, his children had been born
and bred in the South! He would not have
liked to sec their cheeks as white as these.
The old waringin- tree in front of the office
was gone, but the quarters were still there.
He slipped through the gate, past the super-
intendent’s house, which seemed to look nar-
rowly at him under the half-closed lids of
the verandah blinds as if it knew exactly
who he was but did not think it worth while
to claim acquaintance. Drifting through the
cool shadows of the garden he reached the
tennis-court, whence he could see the long,
barrack-like building in which he had spent
four of his adolescent years. It looked
drugged and oppressed, like a sleeper who
has commenced his slumbers in the moving
shadow of a tree and now lies exposed to
the full glare of the sun. The palm-tree
which had once shaded his balcony now hung
ineffectively 60 feet above the roof. He
could see his old room. There was a new
man in it, he supposed. No use to go and
knock him up. He would be sleeping after
tiffin; and, anyhow, he would be some young
cub who would not understand.
It was silent as the grave. Only the ter-
rible sunshine seemed to be shouting in his
ear. He crept out of the sleeping compound,
feeling strangely friendless. It was perhaps
that lonely feeling which made him turn
to the right and complete the circuit of the
aloon-aloon. The Presyn girl lived on the
third leg of it. He could see the dirty-white
front of her ancestral home glimmering
under the trees. He would go and look at it,
at any rate. He wondered what had become
of her. She had always been keen on catch-
ing a white man, and he wondered if she
had succeeded. Quite likely. Fifteen years
ago she had been a dashed fine looking girl
for all her colored blood; and doubtless some
poor simple devil had fallen victim to her
fleeting charms.
A cold sweat came out all over him at
the thought that he might easily have been
that simple fool himself. The bare idea of
being fixed for life in that Eurasian menage
positively palled him. He stood stock still
in the middle of the blazing street to look at
it: at the absurd garden of bare earth set
with precise rows of pedestal pots in which
palms and shrubs drooped sadly in the heat,
at the stumpy white columns of the low-
pitched verandah supporting the low-
pitched rusty iron roof. There was a fat-
bellied, broken-backed pig rooting hopefully
around the flowerpots, two red-haired mon-
keys quarrelled in the shade, and a ragged
cockatoo, unaffected by the heat, roamed to
and fro on its perch, screaming harshly.
Prestidge compared this picture in his mind
with his own little red-roofed cottage on the
heights beyond North Shore, the tiny front
garden with its blue, mauve and yellow-
asters and its patch of buffalo-grass with the
redgum growing out of the middle of it, the
sandy back yard with its clean, w-hite poul-
try, his workshop crammed with tools and
rubbish, the little view 7 of Sydney between
two hills, and the voices of his fat and
rowdy children playing in the bush, mixing
with the muffled clatter of his wife inside
the house, laying the table for high tea at
6 o’clock.
The slap, slap of sandals crossing the
cement floor of the Presyn girl’s verandah
broke through Prestidge’s meditations. The
Presyn girl! The little Leentje ! Prestidge
stared dumbly at the ruins of that dark
pretty face w-kich had once fascinated his
romantic soul, wnile the woman glared at
him, wondering who the strange white man
was who was crazy enough to walk about
the streets at mid-day. Thank Heaven, she
didn’t recognise him, but turned aw-ay and
projected an angry stream of clipped Dutch
and Malay at two half-caste children play-
ing in the street.
A feeble protest came from behind her,
and a man’s shadowy form laid out on a
long chair stirred irritably. Prestidge could
see he w T as a European. Looked like a Brit-
isher, too. Poor beggar! He couldn’t help
feeling sorry for the man. Looked as if he
was full of gin and fever! Sacked by his
firm and ostracised by the English com-
munity, of course, and living with his wife’s
family because he couldn’t afford to buy a
house of his own. Might have been quite a
decent chap, too, once. Might have come up,
like himself, as a youngster years ago, full
of romantic nonsense about the East and
melancholy passion for the white girl he had
left behind him. The old story. Kept out
here a year too long. Loses hope of ever
getting back, starts messing round with the
Eurasian girls through sheer boredom and
despair. Gets to telling them in broken
Dutch and Malay that he loves them. Then
one evening this Presyn girl falls on his
neck and tells him she has broken off her
engagement with that fat half-caste, Rodri-
guez, because she has believed his protesta-
tions. Father and mother listening behind a
screen, probably, ready to threaten breach of
promise.
That was what had happened to Prestidge
—to himself. But. of course, this chap,
being full of youthful notions of chivalry,
did the honorable thing and married the girl,
which was just what he would have done
himself if his superintendent had not been
a man of action and transferred him back
to Australia within a week.
Prestidge shivered violently at the thought
of the danger he had missed so narrowly.
He wondered who that chap could be. His
shape looked familiar. Perhaps he had
known him once. Might have lived in quar-
ters with him. He could see his profile now
and it was amazingly familiar.

A TREACHEROUS TROUBLE
Kidney diseases are very dangerous. They come on
silently, gain ground rapidly, and cause thousands of
deaths that could have been prevented by proper
treatment in the beginning. Nature gives early
warnings of kidney disease —backache, twinges of
pain when stooping or lifting, headaches or urinary
disorders. If these symptoms are unheeded there is
grave danger of fatal kidney disease. Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills have earned a reputation for
their effectiveness in kidney trouble and are known
and recommended the world over.

EXPERIENCES OF SYDNEY PEOPLE
Mr. Lewis Williams, 602 Botany Road, Botany, Sydney, says:—“l was
a great sufferer with my back and the pain was at times so bad that I had
to leave my work and go home. I was bent almost double and could not
stand up straight without increased suffering. I used various preparations,
but only got slight relief. Reading of cures effected by Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, I decided to try. them. One bottle eased the pain and the
second completed my cure. This did not happen yesterday, but about two
years ago, and I have had no sign of backache all that time, so it is not
mere temporary relief, but a perfect cure. I am always advising my friends
to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and am glad to have an opportunity
to publicly recommend them.”
Twelve years later Mrs. Williams says:—“My husband is still well
and has been free of backache since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured him
14 years ago.”
Mrs. W. Sullivan, 61 Kellick Street, Waterloo, Sydney, says:—“l
suffered terribly with my kidneys for some time. I had terrible pains in
my back and could hardly move without suffering torture. I was also subject
to bad headaches, dizzy feelings, and had urinary trouble, the secretions being
thick and cloudy and difficult to pass. Nothing 1 took seemed to suit my
case, and I suffered on in spite of treatment; but at last I got a good remedy,
and that w r as Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. A friend advised me to take
a course of these Pills, which I did, and I am pleased to say they cured
me of every distressing symptom mentioned. I used 10 bottles in all, and
my cure is perfect, for I have been as right as rain for the last 12 months.”
Ten years later Mrs. Sullivan says:—-“Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
cured me of backache and kidney trouble 11 years ago, and I am still well.
I always keep this remedy by me and take a dose or so now and. then, just
as a help to the kidneys.”

Prestidge rolled his head in the direction of
his wife’s aggressive figure standing between
the pillars of the low verandah.
“For God’s sake, Leentje,” he shouted
irritably, “take that infernal cockatoo some-
where wdiere I can’t hear its ugly voice!
And Leentje! I wish you wouldn’t be for-
ever rowing at the kids!”

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Kenneth macpherson rapped
sharply on the door. There was
something decisive in all Kenneth
Macpherson’s actions. His face was decisive,
with its rigid jaw, and its thin-lipped, com-
pressed mouth drooping slightly at the
corners. Yet Kenneth was a good-looking
man, if not an attractive one. His head
was shapely under its close crop of sandy
hair, his nose was straight and neat, and
his eyes were fine. He was tall and trimly
built and well dressed in a suit of rough,
dark-grey tweed.
Kenneth Macpherson rapped again with a
touch of impatience, and a moment later
the door was opened by Mrs. May herself.
He had never seen Mrs. May in his life that
he was aware of, consequently her behavior
struck him as peculiar. She looked him
in the eyes, and her pale face greyed visibly.
“You have come,” she said with nervous
energy.
“Yes, ma’am; were you expecting me !
Macpherson replied. “I was told at Black-
butt that I could get comfortable board and
lodging with a Mrs. May here at Coach wood.”
"Yes, sir,” said the woman in a low voice.
Her face had gone pink and was growing
white again.
“My name is Macpherson—’Kenneth Mac-
pherson.”
“Yes, sir.” Her tone implied that she
knew this much.
“I am assistant engineer supervising the
building of the iron bridge over the river."
“Oh, indeed! Will you come in?”
So Kenneth Macpherson entered into pos-
session of Mrs. May’s best bedroom, and
became the object of Mrs. May’s tenderc.st
solicitude.
The latter advantage was hitherto enjoyed
by Cope, the invalid up from the city to
rest and recuperate after a long illness. Cope
witnessed the transfer of affection with a
bilious bitterness. It was always so, said
< ’ope. They were never too old to be flustered
off their pins by a handsome young man.
Mrs. May was certainly disturbed by the
advent of the new lodger; she made no
attempt to disguise her preference. She
was entirely at Macpherson’s service, al-
though he seemed reluctant to take advan-
tage of the woman’s predilection, and made
small demands upon her. But he was always
first served and best served; his room was
gaily decked with fresh flowers every day
•>nd lacked nothing that might conduce to
his comfort. Although there was a
maid for such work, Mrs.* May herself did
out Maepherson’s room, with a minute
attention to detail that did not escape the
eye of Henrietta Bolger. Henrietta, too,
was up from the city enjoying rest, and in-
dulging herself in the invigorating air of
Coaehwood.
“It is shameful, and at ber time of life,
too !” commented Henrietta.
Macpherson alone remained unimpressed.
He accepted the service as though it were
a thing to be expected. Mrs. May’s un-
concealed regard he met with a dour Scottish
reticence that anybody else might have found
repellent. He was self-contained and un-
communicative. Cope found his efforts to
lure him on to euchre entirely vain, and Miss
Henrietta could never inveigle him into an
expression of appreciation, although she
played Chopin all day, and her execution had
g ei , n Jngjdy praised by experts.
Mrs. May discovered that Macpherson
a nobbier of whisky with water and
lemon before retiring at night, and. although
her establishment had hitherto been con-
ducted on dry lines, she provided the whisky
}m(J wjth h J own hands prepared the toddy
j or the young man, and placed it on the
small table by bis bedside,
T’he o fher two lodgers saw Mrs. May’s
devotion. They did not see her suffering;
there was no display of deep feeling away
f rom the privacy of her own room. There
Mrs. May would sit alone, grey-faced, hag-
gar(j with misery, musing on her failure to
aw aken any manifestation of feeling in this
stern young gentleman.
“How can I tell him? How can I?” The
appeal was reiterated with a sense of tragic
helplessness. “Nothing appeals to him, notli-
jri g touches his hard heart. Heaven pity me.
j am afraid—l am afraid ! He beats me off
with his cruel indifference. Instinct tells
])j m nothing. Nothing whispers at his heart.
f| ow will lie judge me? How has he judged
me v Coldly, critically, with no touch of
forgiveness. O God, he is so like, so like!”
Meanwhile Kenneth Macpherson went
calmly about his work, and the bridge began
t;a^e s j ia j, e He was utterly unconscious
of the fact that the tall pale woman who
wag jjj s ] and lady was eating her heart out
because of him, his hard inflexibility and his
obvious puritanical sympathies. Kenneth
Macpherson walked all the way to Blackbutt
to church service every Sunday. Although a
strict Presbyterian lie attended the Church
of England, declaring the Anglican church
to be better than no church at all. He was
stern and bitter towards the men under him,
but strictly just, doing the right thing in the
wrong way with a rigid attention to duty
that might have been acceptable in a much
older Scotchman.
Mrs. May studied his wishes and his predi-
lections to the minutest detail; there was
something dog-like in her devotion, and when
Macpherson noticed it it was only with com-
pressed lips and a dour shake of the head,
He was coming to give heed to the favors
bestowed upon him. He had seen the look
of almost worship in the woman’s eyes, and
it troubled him so that he meditated ehang-
ing his lodgings. But there were several things
to deter him from doing this. He was most
convenient to his work at Mrs. May’s, his
material comforts were meticulously attended,
and the only alternative lodging was at the
hotel, and Macpherson disapproved of hotels
in general and Smike’s hotel in particular.
The revelation came unexpectedly, and
without premeditation on the woman’s part.
Mrs. May was in Kenneth’s room, busying
herself with some flowers, when Kenneth
entered, coming from church. She had taken
up a portrait of an elderly man from the
table and was studying it with rapt interest.
“You are very much alike, you and your
father,” she said.
“You could not please me better. I am
proud to be like my father.”
“Yet he was a hard man.”
“He was a just man—a God-fearing man.”
“His fear of God did not make him lovable
to God’s creatures.”
“So-called lovable men are often merely
weak. But what do you know of my father
—were you acquainted?”
“1 was Alan Macpherson’s wife!”
“His wife! You were my father’s wife!
Then you are”
“Yes, I am your mother, Kenneth.”
Macpherson turned grey under his tan. He
backed away two steps, and leaned against
the wall. “I have often thought of meeting
you,” he said. But there was no weakness
in his voice. His face was hard.
“And I have often thought of meeting you,
Kenneth. Thought of it with an unutter-
able longing.” There was a piteous strain
in Mrs. May’s voice; she was looking at him
with pleading eyes. “I have pictured this
meeting. I have thought of you taking me
into your arms, and kissing me. I have heard
you say ’Mother!’ You have pressed me
to your heart. You have whispered: ‘Thank
God, 1 have found you! Now nothing shall
ever part us’!” She sat in the chair on
which she had been leaning, a hand pressed
hard over her heart to still its beating.
“You forget your history,” said Kenneth
coldly.
“I forget nothing. I remember I am your
father’s divorced wife, cut off from my son
when he was a mere babe, denied access to
him, driven out into the world to fend for
myself. I took part of my maiden name, and
sat alone, feeding my soul on the hope of
one day meeting you and finding you brim-
ming with love for your ill-used mother.”
“The sentence was just.”
“There speaks your father.”
“My father was the most honorable man
I have ever known, the most righteous.”
“Your father was cold and cruel. He
used every device within h'is power to ruin
me. I was guiltless, he spent money freely
to prove me guilty—a man who would spend
money on nothing else.”
“You had a fair trial, you and the man.”
“The man! There was no man, only one
who had been my good friend; who remained
my good friend as long as I would accept
his friendship; who wished to marry me. But
I would not concede even that much to the
suspicions of my enemies, nor would I take
advantage of a good man’s generosity.”
“I cannot believe, 1 will never believe, that
my father was capable of doing anyone a
grave injustice. I will not believe so astute
a man was so greatly at fault —especially
where his own loved wife was concerned.”
“Loved wife! Forgive me, I cannot laugh.
You lived your life with your father, and
never found him out. It is hopeless to ex-
pect you to see him now in his true light,
But he loved his respectability more than
he loved his wife, he accepted himself at
other people’s valuation, and all said he was
upright aud just and God-fearing.”
“I will not listen to your abuse of my
dead father.”
“Not even for the sake of your live
mother?”
“I can never believe that anything but jus-
tice was done you.”
“Then believe I lie when before my God”
(she went on her knees and raised her
clasped hands) “I swear that I was an
innocent woman.”
“I believe my father.”
“Kenneth, have a little pity—l love you!
All my life I have loved you. I have been
a lone woman nursing a shadow close to. my
heart, the shadow of my son. When I saw
you first at my door I thought you had come
seeking me, and a wild, hungry joy seized
upon me. I almost fainted. You cannot
conceive what your love means to me. 1
have deserved to be loved. I have been a
forsaken woman, a faithful soul, faithful to
my son’s memory, determined only to be
worthy when he came for me. Often I
thought of going to you; but I had seen
you, and your likeness to your father fright-
ened me. I had only this one terror, that you
would grow up like him, behaving like your
father, thinking like your father, looking like
him.”
“I have grown up like my father. I know
no finer example.”
“God help me, yes!”
“Mrs. May, I have been thinking of leaviug
your house. I shall go to-night.”
“God help me!”
He turned abruptly and walked from the
room.
The woman was on her knees by the chair,
her face between her arms. “God help and
keep me!” she moaned. “Alan Macpherson
lives on. My son is dead !”
