THE “KEEPER” PILE FILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, hut know-
ing l as Ihey do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ”
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make

colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic cases by a single
dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL OASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim tor this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER”
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if*you are jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRY
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
onlv (brown label), 6 6 per box.
The title the “KEEPER” PILL is registered as our
trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors,

We wish it to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely inclusive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything w'e' sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life—honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few-
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, butit the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
never cease from their toil; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

Editor Bulletin, —“ Why are bulls more
savage in England ?” Answer : Because they
aren’t. In England they are allowed less liberty,
and the country is more crowded. In Australia a
herd-bull will hardly see a human being except
the stockman in twelve months, and the stockman
is always on his guard, and doesn’t mind a charge;
while in England people who are not on their
guard may any day come in the way of a farmer’s
bull.—R.
Gov. Hopetouu kept in his scrap-book
every paragraph or picture he could find in any
Australian paper, either about himself or Lady
Hopetouu, including “ the one referring to Lady
H.’s accident, and congratulations on the safety of
her little Irish nose.” That was the par. in which
The Bulletin expressed its felicitations on the
fact that the bandages upon the dainty little
“organ” relieved her from the eternal insistanoe
of the predominant characteristic of marvellous
Smellbourne.
As a young barrister, Higinbotham sank
to a penniless condition in Melbourne, for the
attorneys did not believe in him, evidently regard-
ing him as a visionary. His luck came round
through a mighty barrister getting drunk, where-
upon five briefs devolved on Higinbotham within
two days. He rose to the occasion and was a
made man. Higinbotham’s conscience prevented
him from ever making a very first-class Bar
income, and he gained financially by being hoisted
to a judgeship.
Newspaper reporters help to inflate the
gallant captains, and pursers, and other profes-
sional lady-killers of the mercantile marine. A
ship’s officer is, apparently, something to he
greased down by an admiring press, after the
passengers have thanked him all round for a most
delightful voyage, and left him in a puffed-up con-
dition. The other day a Melb. bird - fancier
received two pairs of choice canaries by a certain
steamer, and the local evening journal screamed,
“ Too much praise cannot bespoken of the manner
in which the birds were cared for on the way
out by Mr. Blank, the- chief steward.” Why con-
fine all the adulation to the gentleman who fed
the four canaries ? Probably the captain, his sub
ordinate mates, and the leading engineers deserve
public gratitude for their courtesy in saying,
“ Chirp, chirp !” every time they visited the birds
of passage.
The only known cure for influenza is Cole-
mane and Sons Bucalypte Extract.
The writer of “Fugitive Notes” in S.M.
Herald naturally dislikes literary brilliancy.
What we want is “ a novel in which there is not a
clever saying in the whole book.” Now, if
“ A.8.C.” would only write a novel ——! The
Herald, now but a penny, is still tuppenny at
heart. In fact, it is now so dull that it is becom-
ing threepenny. Once, there were 'oases in
the desert—when the clever, cynical Dr. Neild
wrote a “Melbourne letter,” and Nugent Robert-
son contributed “As you Like it,” and Francis
Myers occasionally wrote an eloquent column ; but
now all the brightmen—theborn journalists, not the
dull clergy and the dry-as-dust lawyers—are on the
Daily Telegraph : Farrell, and Courtney, and
Peters, and Blackwell and TaperelK

The Chinese of Sydney, some months ago,
collected amongst themselves £25, in Is. sub-
scriptions, as prizes fora “poetry-contest.” The
head of the movement was a Celestial fancy-goods
dealer, and competitive verses were received from
all parts of.N.S. Wales. The compositions were
forwarded to a Chinese literary society at Hong-
kong, and the awards of the judges have now
reached Sydney. The principal prize-winner is a
litterateur named Lee Choy Chong, who was
living in modest retirement in a suburban garden,
and it came as a surprise to the local Chinese that
a person possessing so much talent should not
have received earlier recognition. The gifted Mr.
Lee Chov Chong has now abandoned cabbagee
pursuits," and has been installed on the literary
staff of the Sydney Chinese newspaper, Quong
Yik Wah 80. He is perhaps the only poet in
Australasia who is.getting a living at the game.

Ed. Bulletin, —
Trenwith’s grievance is the attempt to form a Liberal
Association in' Victoria while there is already the Labor
and Land League, which, he contends, is doing all the
work.
Thrice is he armed, etc. Is Trenwith justified?
The trail of the hob-nailed superstition is over
the Labor League, and the taint on all its utter-
ances is that the manual laborer and his union are
the two objects for which the democracy exists.
Prominent among these men are certain J.’sP.
who adopt the Fat Man policy of packing benches
when semi-political trials are on strike oases,
etc. This putting of new wine into old bottles—
of compromising the new ideal with the old injus-
tice—is not a necessary adjunct of the Labor
League; hut it is typical of that class of men who
wage war on oppression without a reasoned plan
of aotion. Trenwith himself does not suffer this
blame, but the League does. The proposed Liberal
Association would fight for government by the
people for the people. The League fights for
government by the “ working man ” for the
“ working man.” This distinction may be a little
too broad, hut it indicates the difference. This is
not written in any spirit of disrespect for the
“ working man ”as popularly defined —he has his
place and value in the democracy.—Fluffy.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
ffon
The only really successful prevent
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
CURA Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, Cuticura Soap is simply incom
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for, tbe Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it proc uces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest o
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.

Prisons and Criminals.
Herbert Spencer has spoken the last word
on the ethics of prison discipline. He has
laid it down that “ such portion of a crimi-
nal’s right is only justly taken away as can-
not be left to him without danger to the
community.” This implies that the term
“ penology ” is a misnomer, and that any
punishment attendant upon the treatment of
offenders should be purely accidental. Pro-
tection is the end aimed at by society :
punishment follows or not according to the
disposition of the offender and the nature of
the means taken to achieve the end. Further,
it implies that the better the means employed
towards the end the less punitive will be
their effect. It is a question of achieving a
maximum of cure with a minimum of pain.
# # •
Australasian prison systems are concerned
neither with science nor with ethics. They
are plants with their roots in convictism and
their branches in the fog of penal tradition.
They suck in the sap of barbarism and draw
in the blight of miscalled civilisation. Every
province has been content to stick to the old
order of things, grafting on occasionally an
unsuitable sprig of something new. There
has never yet been a prison administrator in
Australasia who put his heart into his work
with enthusiasm, and his head into it with
scientific method. Each has been content
to take up his task like any ordinary civil
servant, and perform it in mechanical red-
tape fashion. Now and again a Commission
has sat and digested several British Blue-
books, embodying the result in a more or
less satisfactory report. Sometimes the
recommendations have been adopted ; some-
times not. Often they have been partially
carried out, and consequently botched. Any-
how, it doesn’t matter, because uncompre-
hending imitations of English or any other
methods are useless. There is no prison
system in the world that can be exactly
copied with advantage. What Australasia
needs to do is to eclectically construct her
own system, and set an example to the world
as she has done with the ballot-box, woman’s
suffrage, the larrikin and the fighting kan-
garoo.
# # «
In Australasia, as elsewhere, the Judges
create difficulties at the very outset by in-
congruous sentences ; and, so long as periods
of imprisonment are left under the influence
of judicial fads, fancies, and prejudices, the
difficulties will never grow less. This subject
is stale, yet as important as ever. A single
recent example will serve to show the
ludicrous irrationality of the system. Two
men were arraigned before different Judges
for perjury. In passing sentence on the first
the ermined dignitary solemnly declared,
“ This is one of tiie worst cases of perjury I
have ever tried. Your sentence will be 12
months.” The other was hapless enough to
fall into the cruel clutches of Mercy. To him
the presiding Solomon said : “ I fully concur
in the verdict of the jury, but, as there seem
to be some extenuating points in your case, I
shall only sentence you to two years’ im-
prisonment.” Each Judge may be deemed
right according to his own views. But that
such a farce can be daily played shows that
the crude principles of our criminal laws are
hopelessly wrong.
• * #
When the victim of the law enters a
“ first-class ” Australasian prison the sterile
farce is continued, tie is usually first sub-
jected to a course of separate and silent
treatment ; he is known only by a number,
and when he marches out to exercise in the
radiating yard he wears a canvas mask. He
works only in his cell, picking oakum or
plaiting straw. His food is plain and scanty.
He is only visited by the parson, who fires
into him periodical doses of premeditated
piety. This continues for three months at
least, and nine at most, according to the length
of sentence. It is fatuously intended to
achieve various objects. First, it is sup-
posed to encourage remorseful meditation ;
secondly, to impress the victim with all the
horrors of prison life ; and, thirdly, to pre-
vent old offenders from mixing at once with
old-time companions and giving them a
budget of news fresh fiom the world ; while
there are many more alleged benefits con-
ceived with equal guilelessness.
* • *
At the end of his edifying seclusion the
prisoner is passed on to a gang. His num-
ber is dropped and his name disclosed ; the
rest of his history comes out by degrees. No
matter what his offence, venial or cardinal ;
no matter what his career ; he is usually
associated with the worst of the province’s
criminals. He may be only a first offender,
and a mild one at that; but in Victoria, for
example, it is all a matter of chance whether
he is sent to a first offenders’ prison or to a
place like Pentridge. The chances are
against him, for no Australasian province has
sufficient gaol accommodation to keep the
first offenders apart. All that the p isoner
has to do at this secondary stage is to keep
straight before the eyes of the officials, so
that he will get his full complement of
marks, and the consequent remission in sen-
tence. That ensured, he can traffic ; frater-
nise with the heroes of the establishment;
indulge in nameless immoralities ; do, in
short, whatever he is tempted and inclined
to do. The authorities are utterly indif-
ferent. All they expect is that their charges
shall conform to the prison rules. Official
concern begins and ends with the prisoner’s
good behaviour in gaol. It is callous as to
his future career when out, or as to his
prospects of coming back. Up to the last
hour, the prisoner is associated with his com-
panions in bond, so that, if inclined, he can
carry out all kinds of messages to free
friends. Hardly a prisoner liberated from
an Australasian gaol fails to bear some mes-
sage or messages of this kind. Thus is kept
compact and complete the confraternity of
crime.
* # #
Very often, if offenders were liberated at
the end of their preliminary separate and
silent dose, they would re enter the world
not worse, even if not absolutely better men.
The subsequent association, soul-petrifying
as it is, spoils all. This is not meant to be
an argument for solitary as against associated
treatment. It means simply this : that
where, as at Pentridge and other large Aus-
tralasian prisons, a short course of separate
is followed by a long course of associated
treatment without classification, little, except
evil, can result. The process is simply one
of developing into matured criminals the
large number of moral weaklings who
undergo it. The authorities will say, of
course, that any other system is “im-
possible.” “Impossible” is the “blessed
word ” of officialdom ; and, to the official
mind, it merely signifies that a suggested
reform is not in accordance with traditional
routine. If the reform is “visionary” as
well—that is, if its goal is admittedly one not
easy to reach in the present imperfect state
of human appliances, then its official
epitaph is finally written. The atti-
tude is as stupid as most official atti-
tudes are. It is admitted, of course, that
however high our ideals we must be limited
by wliat is expedient—our utmost ethical
obligation being that we shall make the ex-
pedient conform as far as possible to the
equitable. But the Australasian penal
authorities have probably, like the Austra-
lasian public, never given the equity of their
business a thought. Their adoration of the
expedient wholly excludes the ethical. They
are hopelessly possessed with the fallacy that
imprisonment is merely a process of punish-
ment and revenge.
Without a disturbance of the present
slumbrous system greater than that involved
in a re-arrangement ..of its Bed-clothes, an
effective reform could be achieved. Every-
body is agreed—intelligent criminals and all
{vide criminal literature from “ Vaux’s
Memoirs ” onwards) as to the evils of in-
discriminate association. These would be
considerably diminished if prisoners were
subjected to separate treatment at the end as
as at the beginning of their sentences. Were
they suddenly withdrawn from the gangs
without notice, the eggs of many plots would
be addled in the hatching. Michael Da vitt,
for different reasons, recently suggested such
an alteration in English prison discipline.
A few years ago Victorian authorities con-
demned the proposal as impracticable, mainly
because it had not been adopted in England.

Again, the Court, higher and lower, is too
often the ante-chamber to the sraol. Re-'
vised statutes are the only remedy. At
present there is in our laws too much of the
phrase “at the discretion of the Court.” It
would not matter so much if the Court
displayed even the average amount of dis-
cretion ; but it too often exhibits none what-
ever. The classification and sentencing of
offenders is too great a tax on the discretion
and liver of any individual or institution.
The laws conferring the powers are archaic ;
and the time for careful and scientific
revision by Parliament is over-due. The
weak and friendless too easily become classed
as criminals : the influential scoundrel has
too many opportunities to escape scot-free.
• # #
The jurisdiction of the lower (magisterial)
court should be more sharply defined. It
should have no power to imprison, still less
to flog, but only to summarily dispose of all
venial offenders by fine, or other means yet
to be mentioned. These offenders should be
classified by scientifically-inspired and care-
fully-constructed law, not only according to
offences and social positions as now, but also
according to age and the number of previous
convictions. A certain number of previous
convictions would, upon a fresh prima-facie
case being made out, pass the offender out-
side the jurisdiction of the lower and into
that of the higher (judicial) or Criminal
Court.
* * *
The prison should be solely a place for
criminals, and no tribunal except the higher
court should be allowed to wield the grave
power of declaring a citizen to be a criminal
within the meaning of the law. The pro-
vince of the Judge should be confined
strictly to seeing fair play and to applying
the verdict of the jury. Every safeguard
should be erected against justice-by-Jiver-
complaint. Therefore, the Judge should not
have the power to determine sentences, but
only authority to simply commit the offender
to a prison.
• * #
The period of a prisoner’s detention in
prison should be almost as indeterminate as
that of a patient in a lunatic-asylum. It
would require to be regulated by a minimum
to be served before release or probation
became allowable, and a maximum beyond
which the prisoner could not be detained
without further authority obtainable from
the court by the prison department, if justi-
fied. The principles upon which sentences
should be determined would obviously require
exhaustive deliberation before being em-
bodied in law.
* * *
The gradual consequence of preliminary
classification of offenders by the law would be
that the community would soon have its actual
criminal class reduced to correct and compact
proportions. As adoption of the indeter-
minate sentence would mean that a greater
number would be detained for long periods,
it would be more than ever necessary that
prison discipline should be relaxed. Ihe air
of dismalness in which the prison is shrouded
must be dissipated : cells should be less like
tombs; and social recreation should not be so
diligently suppressed. It is not necessary—
nor, indeed, is it just—that prisoners should
be hideously attired, or be miserably and
monotonously fed. Also, there is no decent
reason why the pipe or harmless games such
as draughts, chess, dominoes, etc., should be
forbidden. >
•' • «
Meanwhile, venial and infrequent minor
offenders would never enter prison at all.
Their offences never justify such a drastic
and complete restriction of their rights.
There are other means (alreadyin operation in
some shape elsewhere) of keeping them under
sufficient supervision. Among such means
are : (1) The probation system, coupled with
a scheme of restitution, whereby the petty
larcenist, for example, might retain his
freedom under supervision, and expiate his
offence by restoring the amount stolen with
a small sum as a fine. The supervision
would be best entrusted to special confi-
dential officers unconnected with the police.
(2). A system of military discipline, under
which all human waifage and wreckage not
probationable could be furbished up and
drilled into an appreciation of clean, decent,
industrious and regular life. Under this
scheme the Melbourne, or any other city
prison, would become an open barracks, the
occupants of which would be as restricted,
and, at the same time, as free as soldiers.
# * * '
With the worst of the venials grouped in
barracks and the criminals safe in gaol, the
troublesome question of employment would
remain to be settled. So far as the prisoners
are concerned, the problem would lie solved
by the reduction in their number by
classification. With the prison to keep
in order, and a little Government work
besides, there would seldom be any sur
plus labor' availab’e for fulfilment t) f
orders for civil servants’ boots, &c
As for the army of venial*, they would bo
engaged at drill and fatigue duty, the latter
to consist chiefly of useful public work, which
would not be done at all were it not done by
the employment of such labor. At first, the
cost of the new system here proposed would
be comnaratively great ; but gradually, when
the right principles were got into good goiuo-
order, the expenditure on prisons, police'’
&c., would probably fall much below that at
present incurred by any province. Anyhow
the immediate simplification of the terrible
tangle in which so-called Wine statistics are
tied, would in itself be worth some extra
expense.
* # *
The criminal has to be rescued from the
Pecksniffs of piety and pseudo-philanthropy;
and science is attempting the task. The
Italian school, led by Lombroso, has done
and is doing, much to give crime its proper
place in the student’s curriculum. Perhaps
the Italian method is carried too far. There
is too much measuring of brains ; too much
analysis of faces: altogether too much
picking to pieces of specimens. The
social failure is neither a victim to be
bailed up in a ■ cell and bombarded with
Bible-readings by the leisured snufflebuster ;
nor a peculiar kind of insect, to be dissected
and vivisected, measured and weighed, stuck
through the head with a pin, and generally
made up in a parcel and put under a micro-
scope by the scientist. He is to be trea’ed
justly by human methods, aided by the
highest dispassionate, yet sympathetic, in-
telligence. tie is to be restored to society
where possible, to be restrained by society
where necessary, but tortured by society not
at all.
# # #
So absolutely wrong are present prin-
ciples, so rotten is the administration of
them, that only revolutionary reconstruction
can set things right. Admittedly the crimi-
nal and social-failure problems are difficult;
but that is no reason why they should be, as
they have been, persistently shirked. Upon
their satisfactory solution must follow a
material diminution in crime and vice.
Society’s safety, as well as its conscience,
calls for a change.
The Gospel according to St. Jeamos.
It isn’t long since Paul Bourget remarked that
Americans gravelled for lack of occupation could
happily put in their spare time trying to
find out who their grandfathers were. A good
many Australians—on the evidence of “Burke’s
Colonial Gentry,” the second volume of which
has just been published—have been engaged
upon a similar problem, with such unexpected
success that the welcome discovery of the re-
quired relative appears to have sent them
flapping boldly up the ages upon the wings of
imagination—the general result being aptly
symbolised by the fact that these two volumes
of vain-glory are gilt-edged only upon top.

Searching the preface of this elegant work of
fiction for extenuating circumstances, The Bul-
letin respectfully notes that “many distin-
guished families at home have sent their younger
sons to win their spurs in the colonies. ” The
Bulletin remembers more than one “cadet,” at
all events, who was winning, with his spurs, the
modest remuneration of a stockrider; but it has
known a good many more who “added new
lustre to the family-name ” by boozing indus-
triously from remittance to remittance, and it
has more than once beheld the haughty scion of
a “ house ” entitled to “ supporters ’’ provided :
therewith in the shape of “ two Hibernian ,
salvages grasphaut, azure, boutonny argent,
helmeted sable.”

Humanity—or most of it—is a flunkey, when ■,
it isn’t a snob! Even Walter Scott could
make a fetish of a glass which had been used i
by that mangy rascal, George the Fourth..
But Scott, in the tradition of his education !
and environment, had an excuse which will not
fit the squalid rank-worship that fathers the :
eagerness of so many Australians to be deemed I
“the tenth transmitter of a foolish face.”’
There are, of course, men amongst us who can i
establish as undeniable a descent from those ■
robbers and murderers of the 11th century who ■
wore iron all over them as certain others of us ;
can from those of the 18th, who wore it only,
round their ankles. But it is to a third class—
loftily contemptuous of the second, and yet
feverishly anxious to identify itself with the
first—that the examiner of this Gospel of St..
Jeames will be chiefly indebted for an exposi-
tion of the genealogic feats that can be per-
formed with the aid of the four simple little 1
words “alleged,” “reputed,” “ presumed,” and!
“ supposed.”

In the matter of “arms,” however, the 1
compiler of this precious record has been
inconveniently careful to discriminate between,
“bearings legitimately used” and “those,
which, the editor regrets to say, are mere
assumptions from families with which no.
relationship can be proved.” Unholy trifles,
with the august blazonic mystery, however,,
may soothe their aspiring souls with the reflec-
tion that amongst the arrnorially orthodox are.
such nouveaux arrives as “ Cooper, of Wool-
lahra,” “ Wilson, of Ercildoune,” “ Clarke,.
of Rupertswood.” The would-be feudal twang,
of which style of nomenclature 1 , by the way,,
turns the laugh badly against itself when, the.
mere fancy-name ofa'house is made vaguely to.
masquerade as a territorial designation..
“Sargood, of Rippon-Lea !” “ Ueakin,. of.
Llanarth !” As who should say “ Egerton,.
of Tacton,” or “Stanley, of Alderley.”'
Most notable amongst colonial “coats” is the 1
modest quartering of the arms of France, Eng-


land, Scotland and Ireland, with which one
lofty-souled individual commemorates the trans-
cendent privilege of descent from that bastard
son of Charles 11. to whom Thurlow referred
when he stigmatised another descendant—the
Duke of Grafton— as “the accident of an
accident.” Not that in bastardy itself inheres
the disgrace, but in the slavish eagerness with
which a circumstance which would otherwise
be anxiously concealed is advertised to the
world when it happens to make connection with
a crown —even when worn by such a des-
picable animal as George IV. —to whom a con-
tributor to the corrigenda in one of the volumes
appears nakedly anxious to refer the illegitimate
parentage of his own mother ! Surely, surely ,
someone must have been hoaxing Burke ! Said
the late Professor Jowett to a tuft-hunting
student —“ This miserable rank-worship is the
social leprosy of England ! Keep clean, young
man ! keep clean ! ” Let every Australian
paste the words in his hat, and look forward to
that not impossible time when some conscience-
striken culprit, charged with wilfully and mali-
ciously making use of a title, shall be heard to
murmur from the dock—“Oh, my offence is
rank 1 it smells to Heaven ! ”

For the present, however, the number of
hitherto unsuspected persons who—according
to their own confession—are “ entitled to write
themselves armigeri in any bill, quittance,
warrant or obligation,” is most democratically
.discouraging, though, on the other hand, many
, reasonably suspected individuals turn out not
.even to have committed themselves as far as a
trumpery little crest. The New South Wales
(Chief Justice, for instance, who goes back only
five generations, makes no pretence to armorial
.distinction any more than does Judge Innes,
who modestly contents himself with two re-
imoves. And Chief Justice Madden, of Vic-
itoria, also seeks to question antiquity no further
.than a grandfather.

rage,” upon the bosom of Edward 1., while the

iimportant Victorian person, who, with nine
pages of evolution, achieves the proud dis-
tinction of getting nearly level with Carbine.
The antidote to which style of thing is supplied
by Railway-Commissioner Eddy, who —by
being, like the doughty Marshal Junot, “his
own ancestor”—occupies by far the most dig-
nified position in the x’ecord— unless, as in
certain other cases, the lineal exposition is
perforce withheld, “pending reconstruction.”

Little Dr. Renwick, as a matter of course,
staggers under a mountain of ancestral magnifi-

ness their weakness for double-barrelled names
—put on a genealogic “frill” which is badly
discounted by Dr. “ Plevna ” Ryan’s record of
what he did “per se,” and not “per proyealtores
■ stios.” The ecclesiastical cranium, also, is
, quite large enough for its reverent hat, as re-
gards conceit of extraction, though the most
(Unimpeachably blue-blooded cleric in Australia
.tootles much more mildly on his ancestral
(trumpet than the episcopal person who is

:suspect the hierophant of this fantastic
<cult of poking occasionally at the vota-
ries thereof a solemn and respectable kind
«)f “ borak,” as when, for another instance, he
dumps down the genealogically-naked “0. J.
Roberts, Esquire,” right in front of a six-page
procession of Egerton-Warburtons. There’s
a flavor of cold joke, too, about the insinuation,
per italics, that a certain efflorescent journalist
has very possibly no right to the arms he arro-
gates —even after that distinguished person has
been allowed to expand his chest about the pos-
session of a family whisky-mug, reputed to have
assisted at Caledonian coronations. The
Bulletin, as far as that goes, gives itself no
airs over the ownership of a beaker which can't
be proved not to be the veritable article out of
which the late Mr. Noah drank, not wisely,
but too well.

In connection with which prototypical vig-

ihaving meandered through 30 generations from
the brass-bound marauder who played “ second
ruffian ” to Strongbow— links thus happily
together the aristocracies of pillage and swill-
age. Yet, what is such poor, fag-end twinkling
of distinction to the brand-new effulgence with
which “ Hereditary-Roman-Marquis-Sir Pat
Jennings ” outshines a batch of mere guberna-
torial earls, about whom the only thing
blazonically remarkable is that John Adrian
Louis, of Hopetouu, is “ supported ” by “ two
females in loose garments, with dishevelled
hair,” for whom it is apparently considered
necessary to vouch promptly as “ all proper ?”

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Alleged Australian Squadron.
Australian Parliaments, over-persuaded by
Jingo-bribed and Jingo-bewitched politician s,
vote £126,000 a year for the up-keep of the
“Australian” Defence Squadron, over which
they have no control whatever. The Australian
people pays for the gold lace of every officer, the
blue jacket of every seaman, and has not the
smallest voice in appointing or governing the
servants whose wages come straight out of its
pocket. The squadron is nominally for the
defence of Australia, and we have the pleasant
assurance that the Admiral (whose screw we
have to find) doesn’t care a brass button for the
wishes of his employers, and can steam away to
“ defend Australia ” in the Red Sea or at Vladi-
vostok the moment it suits his real masters at
the British Admiralty (who pay not a cent
of his wages). The bargain, apart from
its infamous unpatriotism, is the most irra-
tional Australia ever entered into. What
Bulletin reader, in his individual capa-
city, would dream . of paying men for some-
body else to boss about, without him or his
representatives having the right to lift a finger
in approval or remonstrance ? But the congre-
gation of Bulletin readers, in their capacity of
Australian taxpayers, must perforce sit still
and see their money spent at the nod of a clerk
in an office at the other end of the earth.
The most glaring irregularities, the utmost
brutality, the silliest tomfoolery, on the part of
the naval gentry who get their living out of
Australia, find Australia helpless to protest.
So, when the Mildura stokers were all but
roasted alive in their floating purgatory, we
could not stir to protect them. When a man
walking an Australian street is pounced on,
and shipped off to England, away from his Aus-
tralian wife and children, no Australian court
dare interfere. The man may be charged with
desertion : is he, or is he not, a deserter? No-
body knows. It may have been years since his
alleged desertion took place ; identification is
uncertain ; but pleading is useless. Habeas
corpus is a myth; liberty of the subject a fable:
the man is transported then and there without
the vestige of adequate trial. And Australia
suffers that ! She also suffers mockeries like
the recent Ringarooma court-martial in Sydney,
when a captain and a doctor—both in receipt of
Australian salaries—quarrelled as to their
respective rights and duties under the
naval regulations ; and a jury of captains
—some of them also paid by Australia—
defended their comrade, censured the doctor’s
chief witness, excluded the doctor’s most
material evidence, and finally dismissed him
with contumely from the service, after an inves-
tigation in which bias and iucompetency stuck
out 10Q yards. Naturally the captains, how-
ever well-intentioned they may be, had a bias in
favor of their pal. No doubt a jury of doctors
would have sided with their pal. But what is
wanted is not partisanship, but justice. The
doctor put the captain on the sick-list, as he is
empowered to do at any time he sees fit. The
captain refused to go on the sick-list, and
ordered him to go under arrest. The
doctor refused to go under arrest, and
the court cashiered him for it. Not a
word was said about the captain’s refusal
to go on the sick-list, an almost equally grave
offence under the regulations ; and the court
actually refused to permit the doctor to bring
evidence to justify his action. Thus, to take
an imaginary case, if a naval warrior suddenly
goes off his head, and the ship’s doctor, doing
his duty under the regulations, puts that
warrior on the sick-list, he will be quite
warranted in refusing to go, and may play
old Harry with his ship in perfect con-
fidence that an appreciative jury of
brother officers will hold him guiltless.
As to the real merits of the Ringarooma
dispute The Bulletin knows little, seeing that
only half the evidence is before it. But it
knows that the alleged trial of an “Australian”
officer on an “ Australian ” ship was a mere
burlesque of justice, and that the alleged Aus-
tralian nation, having bound itself hand and
foot and delivered itself over to the enemy, can
only look on stupidly and do nothing. The
suspicion grows upon this paper that Australia
is an ass.
Exit N.S.W. Local Government Bill.
New South Wales Local Government Bill has
fallen with the same old thud into the same old
gutter; and Parkes is glad. He can’t get
the credit of passing it; but, at all events,
there is every probability that nobody else
will. That Local Government Bill has
been about to pass ever since Parkes
was a raw Parliamentary recruit, and Parkes
(as he was careful to inform a reporter, the
other day) has been saving the country for 41
years now. Every prominent politician has
tried to pass it, or has boasted that lie tried to
pass it; but the Bill beat the lot of them. It
bested Parkes; it bested Dibbs ; it bested
half-a-score of others ; and now it has bested
Reid. The Bulletin cheerfully anticipates
that the Bill will see every member
of the present generation of politicians
safely in the land of shadows before it ever
dreams of leaving the land of shadows itself.
Its most recent opponent, Premier Reid, is not,
however, disgraced by his defeat. “ The gods
themselves fight in vain against stupidity,”
says Schiller ; and it is chiefly to the stupid
obstinacy of the Labor-party that the wreck of
New South Wales Local Government Bill is
due. They insisted on applying the One-man-
one-vote principle to municipal suffrage. This
paper is not prepared to say it should not be
applied to municipal suffrage, but the point
seems doubtful. r l he association of citizens to
govern a community rests on a different basis
from the association of ratepayers to govern a
municipality. The community is given autho-
rity over the lives and liberties of its members,
anil one man’s life and liberty arc as good
as those of another, hence all have an
equal right, and should have equal powei,
to decide how life and liberty shall be
dealt with by the community. These are
“stakes in the country” which outweigh all
others. The possession of property can no
more be put in the scale against them than a
leaf can be put against a forest. One-man-one-
vote for representation in Parliament is no less
just than expedient. Hut the municipal council
exercises not a direct but a delegated authority.
It governs a restricted area, fixed by Parlia-
ment, to a restricted extent, also fixed by Par-
liament. Its chief concern is, subject always
to tl>3 oversight of Parliament, to promote the
local welfare of those who reside within
the limits of its authority. It expends
funds derived from local contributions,
and the contributors naturally expect, and
generally obtain, control of the expendi-
ture in proportion to the extent of their
contributions. And this seems reasonable.
The ratepayers’ lives and liberties are protected
by the State, and, as equal voters under the
State, they have an equal voice in deciding how
far the municipality shall deal with their con-
venience. But the State does not undertake
to secure their convenience, and surely the
measure of their contribution should be the
measure of their right to influence the way in
which the contributions of all the ratepayers
are expended to promote the general conveni-
ence. If the man who pays ss. in rates should
have, on the ground of his equal manhood, the
same voice in controlling expenditure as the
man who pays £5, then the man who pays
nothing is as much entitled to a voice as either.
Endowment by Government does not complicate
the question. The large ratepayer is just as
much entitled to spend Government endowment
as the small one, and the non-ratepayer as
much as either—that is to say, none
of them has any logical claim to
spend it. The State which endows municipal
councils should have direct representation
on municipal councils. But whether the Labor-
party was right or wrong on the point of prin-
ciple. it was manifestly wrong on the ground of
policy. Half a Local Government Act is better
than no bread ; and it was a matter of cer-
tainty that the Leg. Council would not grant
the whole loaf. The Labor-party pushed its
obstinacy to the climax of a division ; some
Government supporters were treacherous; many
Opposition members deliberately and disgrace-
fully voted against their professed convictions
in order to weaken the Govt, and wreck the
bill; and the Govt, was defeated. Naturally,
it dropped the Bill ; there was no other course
open consistent with self-respect. And, as
before said, The Bulletin stands ready to
welcome Local Government in New South
Wales somewhere about 1955.
The “ Meejum of Exchange.”
A Maoriland paper succeeded the other day
in casting a new light on the old, tired problem
of bi-metallism. The purpose of bi-metallism,
as a good many people know, and a much
greater number, probably, do not, is to make
silver coin legal tender, in the same way as
gold, to any extent, so that the man who owes
£lOOO shall be able to pay it with 1000
sovereigns or 20,000 shillings as suits him best.
Bi-metallists claim that there is not enough of
gold to serve for purposes of buying and sell-
ing, and that owing to its scarcity the price of
gold has gone up, and it takes twice as much
tea or wool to buy a sovereign as it used to do ;
in other words, that a gold standard has
reduced prices and is making the world stone-
broke. Mono-metallists claim that prices have
gone down because more railways, more and
faster ships, and better machinery have made
production easier, and have increased supplies ;
and point out that most of the world’s gold coin
lies idle in banks while business is conducted by
means of cheques and notes; that there is
nearly twice as much silver in use as
there was in the bi-metallic days, much
more gold and paper, and about 60 per
cent, more currency altogether. Also, they
demand aggressively why the world wants
more coin, either gold or silver, when it doesn’t
use half the coin it already possesses. As no
one can get together enough reliable statistics
to prove the case on either side the combatants
claw at each other to very little real purpose.
Most silver-producing countries want bi-
metallism because it will raise the price of
silver and make things boom in their particular
line of business, and most countries which
don’t produce silver view the subject with
gloomy indifference. The combatants on either
side are dreadfully in earnest, and the subject
itself remains vei-y much where it was. Maori-
land, as a land which produces little silver, takes
little interest in the subject. But the island
province is blessed with vast deposits of copper,
and one Maoriland editor raises the very
reasonable question why not have tri-
metallism instead of bi-metallism, and make
copper also legal tender to any extent?
If this were done, he points out, copper
would go up enormously, and Maoriland
would grow so rich that she could, in
a few years, pay off her public debt of
£39,000,000 by shipping to England in bulk
9,360,000,000 coppers. And The Bulletin, after
much serious consideration, doesn’t see any
reason why tri-metallism shouldn’t be as good
as bi-metallism, and it isn’t quite sure that
mono-metallism isn’t as good, or as bad, as
either of them, and it is still trying, without
much success, to arrive at a definite opinion as
to the merits of the w'hole conflict. Of one
thing, however, it is certain —that the introduc-
tion of an iron coinage, which would also be
legal tender to any amount, would help along a
hitherto neglected Australian industry, and
that an iron coin weighing 2cwt. and valued at
20s. would be an inspiriting spectacle. The
“meejum of exchange” is a subject which grows
more perplexing the more it is considered.
Inter-Ausbraliaa Reciprocity.
Editor Bulletin,— On a former occasion I sub-
mitted a plan for a measure of inter-provincial
Freetrade—it provided that all tariff-identities
should be taken advantage of without further
parley. Numerous instances of present agree-
ment were pointed out, and it was also sug-
gested that every tariff revision in Australia
should be carried out with an eye to assimila-
tion with one or more of the other provinces.
A draft report of the Vic. Tariff Board has
been published, and I submit notes thereon
from the reciprocity standpoint:
Agricultural Implements.—The proposed reduction on
taxed implements from 20 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad
ral. will brin/ Vic. into line with S.A., and is, therefore,
to be commended. N.S.W. charges 10 per cent. Biscuits
are at present taxed 2d. in every province. The board
proposes to diversity this agreement by altering the Vic.
dutytoljd. . ~
Candles.—The proposed reduction from 2d. to Id. per
lb. makes a complication. At present N.S.VV. (with IJd.)
is the only exception to the 2d. rate, and the proposed
Vic. Id. rate, therefore, seems unfortunate.
Chemicals.—Certain medical poisons are put on the free
list, presumably for the benefit of anti-federalists
Fruits.—Green fruits, which came into Vic. free for
years, are to be charged 6d. per bushel. This is a tax
exclusively on iuterprovincial trade, and is to be con-
demn'd.
Hats.—Tlie Australian duties on hats are now almost
as tangled as the timber tariffs ; but the board proposes
some brand-new varieties.
Mustard.—The duty on this in Q. and S.A. is 3d. —in
S.A. and Vic. it is 2d. The new proposal for Vic. is Id.
per lb. This is a considerable error in kind, though per-
haps not in degree.
Paper bags.—The proposed reduction will place the
duty somewhere about the average of N.S.W., Q., and
S.A., which is praiseworthy.
Rice.—The duty on rice is treated in an extraordinary
fashion. Hitherto there has been an advantage of 2s, per
cental to dress rice in bond ; this advantage is now to be
almost obliterated. The alteration destroys it as a pro-
tective duty—and as a revenue duty it should be swept
out of existence.
Soaps.—The reduction of Id. per lb. will make the Vic.
duty fall into federal line.
Starch.—The Vic. 2d. per lb. on starch agrees with Q. and
S.A. Id. per lb. would agree with N.S.W. and Tas. ; the
proposed IJd. per lb. agrees with no one.
Spirits—perfumed. —The free port to “spirits of wine
for perfumery ” made from Vie. distilled spirits is a first-
class idea—but it does not come into the federal question.
Saddlery.—The present Vic. duty is 45 per cent, ad val.
—a reduction of 10 per cent, is recommended. S.A. is
25 p.e. ;Q. is 15 p.c.; N.S.W. is 10 p.c. ; certainly Vic.
could not come down to the highest of these before
Federation.
“ Stereo-plates.—Duty to be charged as in N.S.W.” This
is proper talk. Every alteration should be made with an
eye to assimilation.
Timber.—Australian timber duties are the chaotic con-
sequences of independent action—their diversity is magni-
ficent, titanic. The Vic. Board proposes more wooden
differences.
Woollens.—Vic. could not possibly make a Federal
adjustment at present. The highest other (Q.) is 25 per
cent. The board recommends a reduction to 35 per cent
from 40 per cent.
It will be seen that no considerable amount of
attention has been given to adjusting the Vic.
tariff on an Australian basis. With several of
the important duties it would be impossible.
But I believe I have indicated other directions
in which the Vie. Tariff Board might have done
more towards the Federal tariff.— Fluffy.
Howard Willoughby (“Timotheus,” of the
Argus) wrote, some time since, an article —
“State Socialism: Its Coming Failure ” —and
it has been thought worth while to cable the
foregone conclusion that it pleases London
Times. Willoughby’s prime argument was
that State Socialism abolishes a desirable form
of repudiation. A joint-stock co. which built a
railway failure could go insolvent and the debt
would cease. Under the same circumstances a
State would have to continue payments on a
dead concern which ought to be buried. Thus
Willoughby. Nothing could be more worthy
of admiration than the cynical courage which
enables “Timotheus” to tell Australia at the
present time that joint-stock repudiation doesn’t
matter. The ’93 “Reconstruction” involved
£103,000,000 in “legitimate banks” —and
about £15,000,000 in illegitimate banks—and
Australia is still reeling from the wholesale
repudiation of that time, whereof Individualism,
not Socialism, stands accused. Socialism and
Individualism may both be on their trial; but
it is Individualism that is now in the dock.
Editor Bulletin, —I was surprised to-day at
finding the enclosed letter returned me by the
N.S.W. postal authorities. The letter, ad-
dressed to Mr. Geo. Adams, contained no money
and no application for shares in any illegal lot-
tery or sweep, but simply asked a question in re
the V.D.L. Bank Lottery, which is legalised by
Act of Parliament in Tasmania, where the
lottery is being held. It appears to me that in
refusing to deliver the letter in question the
Sydney authorities are, first, assuming a censor-
ship over the legislative acts of a neighbor-
ing province ; and, secondly, assuming a dicta-
torship over the citizens of their own region in
re the particular speculations in which they
may or may not invest their money outside
N.S. Wales. Surely the New South Wales
postal authorities must be, or imagine them-
selves to be, possessed of very highly-developed
moral and intellectual faculties when they
undertake so big a contract in a single line.
We may expect to hear that orders for Sun-
light Soap and Lightning Pills are being
returned from the G.P.O. to the senders, or
that applications for shares in Coolgardie mines
will not be delivered to the brokers in Sydney.

Pearson’s Weekly (London), March 16, revives
a venerable friend :
The characteristic climate of Australia and the pug-
nacity of the kangaroo make hunting the hides danger-
ous. Winter starts in May and ends in December in that
country. The rest of the year the heat is intense, the
thermometer frequently reaching 140 degrees.
Eight men hunt together for kangaroos. They are
culled a “see.” When brought to bay the kangaroo jumps
like a flash for a hunter’s breast, and tries to crush it in
with his fore feet. To prevent this each man wears across
his breast a square of matting.
Armed with a spear, with a club attached to the other
end, they ride upon swift horses into a herd. With the
agility and balance of circus-riders they stand erect upon
their liorses and use their spears and clubs.
The kangaroo is able to jump clean over a horse.
Our contemporary makes several serious mis-
takes. The hunting of the kangaroo was long
since stopped by the Government owing to the
loss of thousands of lives. In 1893, 6000 men were
killed in hunting the green kangaroo, which
chiefly depends on its poisonous breath for its
defence. This daring animal suffers from de-
cayed teeth, and the hunter who goes within a
mile of it when it is picking its teeth forfeits
his life. At one time, hunters habitually
carried a tooth - brush and a pot of tooth-
paste, on the principle that if they could get
near enough to clean its teeth there was some
chance of capture, but the theory failed in
practice. The blue kangaroo was hunted suc-
cessfully until recently, but it is now extinct,
except in the remote forests north of Torres
Straits ; and it is to be feared that its dis-
appearance is fraught with much danger to
Australia, as it was the only indigenous animal
able to wage successful war on the rabbits.
Annual cost to Australasia of keeping seven
Agents-General in London;—N.S.W., £5910 :
Vic., £5925; Q., £5550; Maoriland, £3700:
S.A., £3631; W.A., £3130; Tas., £1987-
total, £29,204. And one Agent-General and
staff costing, say, £5OOO could easily perform
all the real work done by the lot. The main
tenance of separate Agents-General is a useless
and expensive tradition; the offices will be
merged into one with the advent of Federation :
why not defy tradition, save money, and hasten
Federation by combining the offices wic’-Why
not? Because the billets are handy for vain

The success that Amykos has met with,
and the universal favour it enjoys both in the Old
and New Worlds, is a sufficient guarantee of the
advantages resulting from its use as a mouth-
wash, gargle, cosmetic, &c. It is unanimously
acknowledged to possess a mild and, at the same
time, energetic efficacy as an antiseptic water,

to science, as expressed by Professor Sir Joseph
Lister, of E linBurgh, in the Lancet— which alone

The reading-lessons in Australian schools are
seldom a credit to the authorities. The absurd
“ Royal Readers ” are typical handbooks of the
drivel of our fathers—with this further defect
that the drivel is diluted for the sake of the
young person. Victoria is so enamoured of
this sort of illiterature in its schools that it pro-
poses to buy certain copyrights in England to
perpetuate the same nefarious assaults on inno-
cent scholars. The schoolbooks of Australia
might advantageously be made a matter for in-
terprovincial action. That each province should
devise and maintain a separate series is waste-
ful and ridiculous excess. Concerted action
between the several departments should result
in a creditable standard of lessons being
reached, and thenceforward the production of
the books could be proceeded with economic-
ally, and with good literary results. But the
miserable jealousy of the departmental authori-
ties is the lion in the path.
The prosecution of the English Jockey Club, for
keeping enclosures on Newmarket Heath to be
used as gaming-places, was doomed to failure. In
the first place, the Anti-Gambling League had
to take proceedings on the spot, and an appeal
to a Newmarket Bench for the conviction of
Jockey Club stewards couldn’t expect to suc-
ceed. Also, the Bench was packed, anyway.
But if the Bench had consisted merely of the
parson who acted as chairman and the other
reverend gentleman who assisted his spiritual
brother’s search for the terevvth,.it would have
been all the same to the A.G. League. Parsons
in that district subsist on horse-racing. Jockeys,
trainers, owners and betting folk of various
descriptions are the Church’s only supporters —
at Newmarket. After the Bench had con-
sidered the case for an hour in private the pre-
siding vicar delivered a characteristic ver-
dict. They couldn’t say the betting rings
were not common gaming places, but they
said that they (the Bench) didn’t feel satisfied
that the Jockey Club “ permitted the enclo-
sures to be used for the purposes of betting
within the meaning of the Act of 1853.” A
further prosecution of bookmakers for betting
in a public place was to have followed, but
the Bench prudently resolved to fix a day
“later on” for that tough job. A crowd of
horsey individuals, mostly with straw in their
mouths, gave three cheers for the local law,
and there the matter ended for a time. Only
for a time. What The Bulletin said before
this farcical event was said in the Referee, by
G. R, Sims, afterwards—“ Thanks to the action
of the Anti-Gambling League, we are within
measurable distance of a thorough reform of
the laws relating to betting, and gambling and
turf speculation generally.”

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
May 7,' 1895,
My Dear Mookabinda—
A paragraph published in this column on
March 30 appears to have been taken by some
people as applying to, and consequently reflecting
on, the character of Mr. Chas. Seymour Allen
(inventor of the submarine torpedo boat of which
so successful a trial was recently made before the
Admiral of the Australian station); and from
enquiries I have since made it appears there
was some show of reason for their misappre-
hension. A misapprehension it undoubtedly was ;
for nothing was further from my thoughts
than that either the paragraph or the material
upon which it was founded could be taken as re-
ferring in any way to anybody in Australia-let
alone to Mr. Seymour Allen, of whom I had never
heard anything that was not entirely favorable,
and with whom I much sympathise in his en-
deavors to trace the authors of certain utterly un-
founded and malicious statements which he
warmly resents.
An entirely new and original horror invests the
complicated position of station-overseer inN.S.W.
The occupier thereof (if a bachelor) generally falls
a victim to the charms of the governess (who is
always single), and is actually sometimes called
upon to engage her ! Imagine a bronzed and
bearded youth, just down from the edge of the
horizon, having to run the blockade of the gover-
ness-agencies—catechising beauty in search of a
job after the manner of Peter Amos Dunn in
“Niobe” (with very similar results, I should
think), and travelling back with his choice and
all her luggage !
And yet that is the burden some station-holders
bind upon the souls of their helpless he-hirelings.
One squatter, whose “ supers ” invariably marry
the governesses and leave his employ, always sends
the new men to Sydney, with instructions to look
out a new governess for Mrs. Saddlebags, The
last overseer who underwent what might be called
the ordeal by governess - agency, expressed his
surprise to a friend (named Bill, I expect) that he
should have been called upon to perform such an
unusual task. “Oh,” said Bill, “ old Saddlebags
always does that. His last three supers married a
governess apiece, so he thinks it only fair to the
newcomer to give him a chance to suit himself!
Anyway, after a man has beguiled a girl
on to a back-block run he feels, in a measure,
responsible for her, and pays her more attention
than he otherwise would. The result is, they both
stop longer on the place.” Quite like a glimpse of
Arcadia, isn’t it ? But if this untrammelled state
of affairs grows into a vogue, I should advise all
instructresses-of-youth on the shady side of 40 to
take in their signboards and retire from business.
A woman wrote to a Sydney paper recently
deploring the absence of an Australian substitute
for the London Harley-street institute which
Walter Besant sodrearily describes in “ Katharine
Regina.” As tilings are, country people certainly
buy a pig in a poke when they engage a governess
in the happy-go-lucky way peculiar to Australia—
through registry-offices or in answer to advts. —so
nobody is surprised when high-priced finishing
governesses turn up spelling pumpkins without
the intermediary “p ” and translating “ Jones v.
Smith” as “Jones via Smith.” There is also a
great deal to be said about the present careless
system from the governesses’ point of view. Many
girls reply to a “squatter’s” advt., to find that
the “squattage” is a bush hotel or something
worse, whence no escape is possible until they earn
enough money to pay their passage back to
civilisation. 1 think that a governesses’ home on
a scientific basis really is a long-felt want. An
attempt was made three or four years ago to set
such an institution moving, but it fell through.
Perhaps the time is ripe for another attempt. So
many “leading” parents have seen tlrir daughters
forced to take up teaching as a means of bread-
winning that the movement would probably obtain
much more cordial support nowadays.
Vice-regal governesses (who are, in Australia,
at least, the little tin-goddesses of their calling, I
supoose) don’t seem to be very lucky folks as far
as matrimony goes. One of them certainly mar-
ried a well-placed swain, and was given away by
her vice-regal employer, with her ladyship much
moved in the front pew; and I suppose she creates
a rosy and glorious precedent most encouraging to
the others. But it must not be forgotten that she
is the exception that proves the rule. I remember
one gouvernante whose slender figure, vivacity,
pearly complexion, and absolute bravery in sport-
ing the same frock times out of number ought to
have rendered her attractive to men, but she re-
turned a spinster as in the first chapter. E located
women who think that attachment to a kawlonial
Governor’s sweet is a passport to the heart of the
Australian eligible, are advised to look up the
ordinary fate of their predecessoresses before sign-
ing articles, as the sailors say.
What an operatic patchwork we’ve been having
lately at Sydney Lyceum ! “ The Mountebanks ”
will be raging when these lines appear, but, all
the same, I want to congratulate the firm on a
most radiant revival of “ The Mikado ” last Satur-
day. Tapley topped the record as Nanki-Poo,
althoug i lie dodged the high-ascending notes in
“ Here’s a how-de-do ” (the “ with a passion that’s
intense I worship and adore” part of it), which
ordinarily give such a skylarkv effect to the trio ;
but Mr. Vi. Varley’s legs, clothed in salmon-pink
fleshings, were most edifying. Altogether, I con-
sider Nanki-Poo one of “ the gentlemanly tenor’s”
very best parts. Nellie S., as Yum-Yum (one of
her pet roles), was not quite so lovely to look upon
as usual—for one thing, the exigencies of Japanese
art necessitate a pair of tomato-red cheeks which
look as if the lady had been frost-bitten, but
otherwise I found no flaws. Yum-Yum must be
a very easy part as far as dressing goes. The
creamy, pink-flowered silken wrapper, edged with
yellow bands, and the big yellow pack-saddle,
were worn bang through the operetta. Marriage
doesn’t much agitate the wardrobe of a Mdlle.
Chrysanthibme, apparently; though Nanki-Poo
broke out into a violent toga, like an ecclesiastical
window-ourtam, when he was going to be married,
Ida Osborne was Pitti-Sing, with her front hair
trimmed in a manner that suggested curl-papers,
at a little distance; and Florence Young played
Katisha, so the playbill said, but she was so
hideously got up that I don’t believe I would have
recognised her a bit—at any rate, not until she
began to talk about showing her left elbow on
Tuesdisand Fridis. The melodious Miss Young
has a fatal habit of clipping her words that would
enable one to discover her even under burnt-cork,
I think the chorus ladies always look very fetch-
mg as part of the Japanese crowd. And very
convincing, too, until you get a broadside view of
their feet.

Wallace Brownlow made an excellent Mika, and
was in mellow voice; but still (I venture to speak
as the mouth-piece of d.c. damseldom) it did seem
a pity that this popular youth should come forth
with his twinkling shanks bundled up in black and
gold millinery, and his fatal countenance to match
—it seemed such a waste of good material, don’t
you know. Apropos ugliness—Vernon looked
absolutely hideous as Ko-Ko lie was as ugly as a
Chinese paper-knife; but yet he has the impudence
when ordered to marry Katisha to talk in an
aggrieved manner about a “caricature of a face.”
But it’s quite true to nature, all the same. The
only thing that would make me work for sex-
equality would be the hope that, by so doing, we
might gain the invaluable masculine prerogative
of being as ugly as possible ourselves, and yet
privileged to talk scornfully about the absence of
facial attraction in somebody of the opposite sex.
Talking of “The Mikado” somehow reminds
me that Dr. and Mrs. On Lee gave a very enjoy-
able “ at home ” at Wynyard-square last Friday,
at which the members of the Esty-Marsh Concert
Co. turned up, and were, of course, the lions of
the evening. Mrs. Marsh (Miss Alice Esty) wore
a gown of heliotrope brocade with fuzzy bodice of
black chiffon, diamond brooches and a big bouquet
completing a successful turn-out; and Madame
Enriquez (who is rather too meditative a per-
sonality to be a drawing-room success) sported
pink and blue with crystal headings, and carried
two bouquets, spoils from that evening’s concert.
Mr. Tenor Cunningham, of the easy-going appear-
ance, turned up smiling as usual; and talkative
Herr Vollmar, with his aureole of ginger hair,
and Mr. Van Vleet, who certainly possesses the
smallest male mouth at present appearing in pub-
lic, were also on deck.
So, also, was “ the greatest baritone who has
ever appeared on the ’Stralian concert platform ”
—Mr. Alec. Marsh.. Mr. Marsh is loud in praises
of Our Organ, Our Harbor, and Our Town Hall,
even going so far as to find something pic-
turesquely appealing about the naval storbs on
Garden Island. „
“In Town,” my Melb. correspondent writes,
does not lend such scope for gowning as its pre-
decessor, “ A Gaiety Girl.” In the first act
simple walking-dresses—or the stage-land equiva-
lent for them—are worn, and in the second most
of the principals disclose their very charming
forms in tights. Maude Hobson, in her first-class
dress of celestial blue moirb antique with fixings
of black velvet and yellow lace, as usual makes
the girls round her look almost insipid, and in the
Romeo costume of black velvet with peaeh-satin-
lined cloak, she shows that her splendid figure
stands undressing quite as well as it does dressing.
Blanche Massey, whose little-head-running-over-
with-curls style of head-dress gives her a some-
what childish and forlorn appearance, wears an
innocent-looking white frock begrilled and be-
tucked in a way strongly reminiscent of an infant’s
long-clothes. With this she dons a bewitch-
ing black-plumed hat, tied under the chin with
broad pink satin ribbons, and balanced on the
head at an alarming angle. Grace Palotta’s first
dress reminded one of an agitated French hen,
covered as it was from neck to hem with absurd
tiny flounces. When she asserted that it had cost
a “very pretty figure” every woman in the audi-
ence leant forward and examined it critically, and
doubted her statement.
Tiny Decima Moore, continues my informant,
affected pale-blue, and looked like a forget-me-
not from the bunch which she carried through
the first act. Her Juliet gown in the second act
is of bespangled white chiffon. The, men in the
piece appear to be a cold-blooded lot, for, with the
exception of Kitty Heatherdon (who is beloved by
the fascinating though stony Capt. Caddingtnn),
not one in this group of beauteous maidens is provl-
ded with an admirer. Certainly the “Ambiguity"
girls chatter a great deal about adorers, who pro-
vide them with diamonds, broughams, and trifles
of that sort; but they don’t bring them on, to let
us have a look at them. They have always “just
said goodbye to them,” or “expect to meet them
at the stage-door at half-past 11,” or have some
excuse or other ; and, as boom-prosperity has not
returned suddenly to this city, and as the only
man at the stage-door was a gentleman with a
basket and a tallow-candle, selling trotters, we
Melb. girls take these inflated statements for what
they are worth, and opine that the “ Ambiguities”
are just “giving us guff” (as the rude little boys
say).
Under the thin disguise of “a grand fete," or
words to that effect, the supporters of what Mdme.
Sarah Grand calls a “ fire insurance office ” (they
call it All Saints Church on its notepaper) really
held a common or garden bazaar at Norwood
Park, Stanmore, on Monday last, in aid of the
bag as usual. The Acting-Governoress set the
affair afloat in the afternoon, but I went to hear
the moonlight concert at night, for which a great
success was locally anticipated. I approve of
moonlight concerts, brass band music, and red
umbrellas as things for which Australia
has plenty of room ; and so (although
rather late in the season for evening pro-
menading) this moonlight concert to which I
allude would have made “ one great effect,” as the
musicians say, if only the moon hadn’t winked
such a watery eye on it. Though, mind you, the
singing was occasionally very local. One lady
sang in a reedy voice, and another rendered con-
tralto music in mezzo-soprano, and the artistic
truth was not in them. The Titan of the pro-
gramme was the baritone, Dr. Maguire, who sang
“The King’s Champion.” in an even and cultivated
voice, yet with lots of color and no exaggeration
of force. I believe that the doctor is to be one of
the singers at next Sydney Liedertafel smoke oh.
The birth at last of a son and heir to the Car-
ington estates arouses much interest in Australia
where the parental experiences of Lord and Lady
C. were a source of universal solicitude. The
aristocratic matron who fails to furnish a boy to
keep the direct succession intact cannot consider
herself in any other light than a scorching failure
from her husband’s point of view, although I sup-
pose a matron who has a quiverful of daughters is
a dear and cherished object to the next-of-
kin or heir-at-law, or whatever it is proper
to call the earth-hungry relative who exists
in castles-in-the-air in constant terror of having
his family nose put out of joint. Not being the
heir-at-law, I am rather glad the Caringtons have
a boy at last. People of such laudable perseverance,
even in the teeth of what looked like a very
forlorn-hope, always deserve to succeed. By the
way, Premier Georgey Porgey Reid is also the
happy father of a bouncing babe. I have noticed a
tendency on the part of our Premier to go without
his eyeglass of late. He has even been photo-
graphed without it, and I think the appearance
of Reid, junior, explains the phenomenon. It has
been given to the baby to play with.
A leading Melb. tea - room is run by the
nieces of two very popular Melb. Clubsters of
old standing. By the way, why don’t women
start a restaurant where men might feed— i.e,,
where men might like to feed ? People are tired
of spooning-places, founded on buns and tea, into
which masculinity plunges with variegated needs,
and takes, lamblike for the nonce, whatever soggy
scone or washy liquor is set before it, provided it
be served by the right person ? That is the only
phase of tea-room “mashing ” that almost touches
the heroic—the determined battle a man will wage
with hide-bound pastry, laying his digestion, so
to speak, at the feet of his divinity. But men (I
don’t use the word in a generic sense merely) are
not built that foolish way, and usually avoid
femininely-run tea-rooms (I am not writing in a
Japanesy sense) as they would church-bazaars and
other one-sided places, where they don’t get the
worth of their money and are expected to smile
at grief, as it were.
When you come to reflect about him, man really
seems to be a greatly-suspected person if he only
stirs one inch out of his beaten track, or else how
is it that he cannot buy a pair of gloves in a
hosier’s shop—especially women’s small sizes—
without becoming an object of speculative interest
for every woman within cooee of him ? Men have
been known, I believe, to run wives and daughters
and such like expensive luxuries, but Society has
arbitrarily decided that these ladies superintend
their own outfits, merely trusting the old man
to foot the bills; therefore a youth cannot hope to
keep above suspicion who buys ladies’ kid gloves
in the open market. If he is a bachelor (though
even bachelors sometimes have sisters and maiden
aunts who presumably don’t go about bare-
handed), a first-class prima-facie case is made out
against him, but if he is a married man (who
might be allowed to dabble a little in such things,
one would think), the culprit is tried, condemned
and morally executed before he has made up his
mind what color he’ll take. It must be a curious
thing for a man to reflect that the unwritten
laws of his country absolutely forbid him to pur-
chase a pair of women’s gloves. What would
happen if he branched out personally and bought
a French corset, or a pair of silk stockings, is
beyond my calculation!
Women who seem to find so much to revolt
against cannot at least quarrel with their freedom
to shop. They have an absolute liberty to buy
whatever they choose, from a pin to a pair of
pants. For instance, nobody suspects a girl buy-
ing a necktie in a man’s shop of any baser inten-
tion than wearing it herself, or making an<
allegorical slip-knot of it for some matrimonially-
doomed young man’s neck. The only thing
women are suspected of in the market-place isj
ordering down bales of the goods from near the
roof, arid going out ultimately with a pair of shoe-
laces.
The story comes to me from Melbourne, par
exemptc, that a woman went into a very big
drapery and asked to be shown some prints to
match with a pattern she had brought to the shop l
“in her eye.” At last, when about the 42nd
bale had been dashed on to the counter, she found

“ Crom-a-boo,” the irresistibly funny and
rollicking Irish song of the Hoben Brothers, which
Sappho Smith opined would prove “a terrible
success,” is already proving. Lonnen has taken
it up in London, and Lauri is to sing it in
Australia; it is to be well introduced in America,
and in Maoriland. where that clever comedian,
Percy, of the Pollard Lilliputians, is making a
feature of it. It is also a universal success and
heard everywhere. Paling’s have already cleared
the first big edition, and have got out two others
in E flat and F. It is certainly the funniest Irish
football-song ever written, and the press every-
where has risen to describe it as the best comic
song of the day, and funnier than “Killaloe” or
“ Ballyhooley.” It is just the thing tor an aspir-
ing oomique, pro. or amateur.*
A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback-the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.
the thing she wanted, of which she purchased a
quarter of a yard at one penny. And the white
slave behind the counter had to make out an ac-
count, and get it signed by one of the partners of
the firm I Shopping must be at a low ebb in Mar-
vellous Melbourne.
I read the other day that a “ pretty ceremony
was performed in the hall of the Stewards of
Truth, .Tatter-sail's Chambers, Hunter - street,
styled a dedication service, when two children,
the sons of the president of the body, were dedi-
cated to the service of God anil humanity.” The
hall was trimmed witli masses of white flowers,
and white roses were showered <m the little young-
sters, and white wreaths placed on each as emblems
of purity! It is all very bathetic. Such things
niay be well enough to give the Australian boy
the moral, mystical tilt he would be somuch the
better for possessing within certain Well-defined
limits—but accounts of them sh mid never be pub-
lished. Think of the result. The eyes of a cyni-
cal world will follow these two young angels right
up to, and even past, the time when they become
aldermen or company-promoters.
It is somewhat astonishing to see how a “great”
daily, whose penlady always was wont to minutely
describe the outward and visible raiment of the
firm’s lady relatives in all their ramifications, took
no sort of heed at the recent A.J.C. meeting as
to what all these interesting people wore ! Simply
a calm statement that Mrs. Su-and So “ was pre-
sent ” not looking nice as usual ; and the result
was a more seemly and modest paper than ever
before issued from that particular office. But the
gowns of the ladies in question got there just the
same, for the rival pen woman had them all down
to the very shoe-laceis in the opposition news-
paper. Which strikes me as being a much more
decent way of doing things.
The way one wealthy woman (who could
import half Baris if she liked) turned out
at a public function the other day—black
skirt, plum-pudding blouse and a brown hat—
seemed to point the moral that every woman is at
heart a guy. Nearly every woman thinks she
would dress to the ends of her nails if her banking-
account would let her ; but directly your critics
know for an indisputable fact that you can be clad
in silk oap-k-pie, then you lose interest in the game
and come out in calico. There’s method in it,
after all. Miss Kilmansegg makes far more of a
sensation and is infinitely more talked about in a
giinea suit than ever she would be in jewelled
brocade. It’s only beggars who mustn’t wear rags.
In Cosmos for April, the photo, is a very faith-
ful one of Essie Jenyns and her child, and an in-
terview with the lady is given by Mrs. Charles
Bright, under the heading “Juliet Married—and
Happy.” Juliet, however, doesn’t seem to have'
very much of interest to say for herself, and her
diction is at times unearthly—like choice pickings
from “Pamela.” Fur example, re the new
dramatists: “Ask me not,” she says with impul-
sive scorn, “ what I think of them.” And again:
“ Bernhardt we saw in Paris. Of her I must nob
speak. She is beyond words to express.” I
wonder if she always speaks in that “sirrah ” tone
of voice? The best thing in Cosmos is a sketch
of “Mucus Clarke,” by Charles Bright, in which
the subject is freely quoted; but I cannot con-
gratulate the management on the sequence of the
items in the latest number of Sydney’s baby mag.
For instance, a dissertation on “Headache,” by
Dr. Sehwartzbaoh, is placed immediately before
“ Musical Notes,” by Henri Kowalski.
A ball in aid of the Orphanage of Mercy is

I have received a copy of Madame Weigel’s
Journal of Fashion, and I must confess that I
haven’t fellowship with quite all the novelties
this up-to-date periodical springs on us. For one
thing, it is alleged that a good many ladies are
wearing “ bodices with the pouch effect.” Just
think of that as a fashion for Millie. Kangaroo,
who already hangs her hands d la marsupial, and
who, in a long, narrow-trained frock and one of
the “new pouch bodices,” would almost come
under the operation of the Marsupial Act, I should
imagine.
I see that the talented Sydney Amateur Or-
chestral Society is advertising for new subscribers.
The A.O.S. (which mourns Signor Hazon, who
brought the Society along more than nicely)
looks more like the nucleus of a really suc-
cessful long-lived musical society than a great
many of its Australian contemporaries. The
average short-haired person rather pins his
musical faith to choral societies, where the words
enlighten his darkness as to the meaning of the
composer, and the V-shaped soprani appear now
and then; but the A. 0.5., which is purely instru-
mental, shows every sign of overcoming the com-
mon prejudice in favor of human voices. Apropos
of music, I hear that the handsome and dark-eyed
Mrs. Vauderveer-Greene is havinganextraordinary
success in London on the ballad-concert platform.
Mine. Emily Soldene, who is on the eve of
departure for London, where she purposes pub-
lishing a volume of theatrical reminiscences, is
to be tendered a complimentary benefit at Sydney
Lyceum on Wednesday afternoon, sth June. A
strong committee has the affair in hand.
I have lately received two waltzes, “The Bell”
waltz, by George Castledean, and “The Lobelia,”
by M. J. Hogan, and I really must say I don’t
know what I have'done to deserve two such com-
positions at one blow. Both are irritatingly tum-
tum and without sequence. '
Yours affectionately,

abruptly of heart-disease, while the remainder is

Agnes Knight is the lady who shares his hand-
some features and fortunes after desperately
endeavouring to hnry herself out of sight with a
guilty secret which isn’t guilty. At the beginning
there is a strike at a steel-works, with an
agitator haranguing the men until Ids throat is
dry, when they march into a pub. behind the
scenes to get beer. It is quite obvious, however,
from the dispirited look of the men when they
come out into the green limelight of starvation,
that the pub, is a mere dummy, and The Bulle-
tin denounces it accordingly. Harry Plimmer,
the wicked employer, walks round and allows the
men to cheek him sociably ; and D’Orsay Ogden
is a blackleg whom everybody knows at once for
a foreigner from Ids way of saying “ Ze ” and
spreading out his hands with bony emphasis. It
seems that the wicked employer has ruined the
blackleg’s daughter Adele (Athena Claudius);and,
later on, he shoots her as well. Before this, how-
ever, George Rignold, as foreman of the steel-
works, matures a great invention, and about the
same time his wicked employer (who hates him
virulently) matures an explosion, which comes
with a boom and a flash and a roar, and nearly
kills George—but not quite. Meantime Scot
Inglis is a handsome lord who stands round and
makes copy-book reflections, and Mr. Sweeney is
a comic Irish personage who stands round and

Plimmer is killed off at 11 p.m. everybody goes
away loaded with aggressive precepts and impres-
sive maxims.

“ Aladdin Junior,” which draws near its
close at Sydney Royal, is chiefly a brightly-acted
excuse for vehemently applauding Maggie Moore
in the name-part, and H. R. Roberts as his
or her historically male mother. The difference
between one burlesque and another burlesque now-
adays is that they are botli the same burlesque;
and, if there is a third burlesque, then they are that
burlesque also. The actors and singers get out of
burlesques precisely what they put in; and, as
much ability and energy are put into ‘‘ Aladdin
Junior,” the public have also extricated much
profit. Particular notice is due to the pretty
dancing of Miss Nellie Osgood Moore, the little
11-year-old (so she says) maiden from Yankeeland,
whose portrait appears on page 10 of this issue.
Nellie (otherwise Aileen) is the daughter of
Maggie’s sister in Murka, and first appeared at
Hobart the other day, playing Bertie (the little
boy), in “Meg.” She proves conclusively that her
aunt has not absorbed all the family talent and
vivacity.

The revival of “ The Mikado,” at Sydney
Lyceum, was welcome, for Gilbert’s humor and
Sullivan’s music are both evergreen. Howard
Vernon, as usual, was the mainstay of the per-
formance, and one’s pleasure is none the less
because familiarity with his methods brings
admiration in its train. There is an intellectual
quality in Vernon’s rendering of rdles like
Ko-ko and Bunthorne which rarely shines
in his coadjutors, and the delicious fun
of his wooing of Katisha (including the
“tit-willow” song) reached on Saturday night
a very high artistic level. The other performers
did not let themselves go, and the opera as a
whole lacked dash. A six weeks’ season, with a
part every night, and a change twice a week, is
indeed enough to damp enthusiasm and hoarsen
throats. “The Mountebanks ” was to be played
on Wednesday.
¥£ * * *
Of other Sydney shows, “ Fun on the
Bristol” is creditably played to popular prices at
the School of Arts by a hard-working company ;
and the Tivoli’s patrons show by their numbers
their gratitude for the excellent programme. 1 he
Brough-Boucicault company are getting good
attendances at Brisbane Opera House, this week s
bill including “The Masqueraders” and “Re-
bellious Susan.” Altogether, the theatrical tide
of Eastern Australia is just now about high-water
mark.
“ In Town,” the second of three items on
Mm George Edwardes company’s list, struck Mel-
b mrno as violently as “ A Gaiety Girl ” would
liave struck that thick headed city if tluyiopula-
tion had been quite ready for it. “In Town ”
was the pioneer musical-comedy in London, where
“ A Gaiety Girl” is presumably reckoned an im-
provement on the original pattern. A reversal of
this order of things has happened in Melbourne,
and the result is worth remembering. An entirely
new kind (leaving the poorly-acted “ Morocco
Bound ” out of the question) of light entertain-
ment was offered to the public. They got the best
brand Hist, and 50 per cent, of them criticised the
unusual tipple ignorantly. But their palates were
becoming educated the while, and when they
came to sample a rather inferior article it was
voted nectar for the gods—by the gods, also by
the stalls and dress-circle. “In Town ” was
an emphatic success on Saturday night. If
the management were able to reproduce “ A
Gaiety Girl ” presently for the final week of the
season, it would no doubt achieve a much more
howling triumph than before. This remark is
made in justice to the clever ladies of the com-
pany, who formed the body and soul of the former
comedy, whereas they are merely the arms and
legs of the subject under discussion.
“In Town,” like everything associated
with the name of Arthur Roberts, the king of
Cockney humor, is mostly run by one man. Louis
Brad field is the Roberts of the piece, and nobody
else goes for very much. He impersonates an
insolent captain, a whirlwindy child of pleasure,
who is responsible for a rush of stage ladies to a
fashionable hotel in the first act, and a rush of
sassiety people to the greenroom of a theatre in
the second act. The captain represents the plot;
the rest is padding—dancing, songs, bustle, and
spectacle. In respect of satire, wit, and incidental
music this airy nothing is not equal to “ A Gaiety
Girl but no matter. It makes a flying start,
and travels faster in the estimation of the audience.

Mr. Brndfield rejoices in his great chance.
He is an easy, happy, droll comedian, a capital
dancer, a sufficiently good singer of the cheap
melodies provided for this show, and a fertile pan-
tomimist. Moreover, he takes the cake modestly,
and is by no means a hot, aggressive mummer.
Mr. Fred Kaye, as a love lorn call-boy at the
theatre; Mr. Bantock, as a private chaplain with
a comic hair-tuft ; and Mr. Ryley, in the serious
(not to say heavy) capacity of a British dock, fill
places in the middle distance. The importance of
the radiant ladies is collective, rather than indi-
vidual. Miss Decima Moore, whose small voice
was somewhat “off” on Saturday, plays a re-
spectable prima-donna in her own pretty little
way. A duchess and her daughter are played by
Mrs. Phelps and Miss Blanche Massey, but after
opening with a neat duet this blue-blooded pair
do very little. The other angels are actresses,
coming and going in clusters, and Miss Maud
Hobson is perhaps a few degrees lovelier than her
rival heavenly beings. Miss Florence Lloyd
comes to the front in trousers on the present
occasion. Miss Lloyd is the duke’s son, and
The Bulletin, being a democratic journal,
objects to her charming impersonation. If
dukes produced such lineal descendants, the
House of Peers wouldn’t be tottering. Miss
Madge Rossell’s solo-dance falls comparatively
flat, because it isn’t as Frenohy as her “Gaiety
Girl ” effort; but the pas de trois and the dresses
(Misses Hobson and Palotta wear tights occa-
sionally), and the scenery, and many other matters
not already specified, are d lieious.

“ La Pompadour,” by Sydney Grundy and
the late W. G. Wells, was dumped hastily upon
the stage of Melb. Bijou last Saturday. A his-
torical play, performed by a scratch company who
lose themselves in its rounded periods and bruise
their shins against the historical situations,
is not a thing to be lightly spoken of.
A masterly silence will meet the case. Mrs. G. B.
Lewis did justice to the lines of the name-part, and
on Friday that time-honored artist will positively
appear as Hamlet, for one night only. On Satur-
day, it is said, Frank Clarke intends to set up a
variety show in succession to Shakespeare’s im-
mortal tragedy. Bijou arrangements are hardly
to be depended on, however. As for variety
shows, Melbourne has enough of them to go on
with. The Rickards speculation flourishes at the
Opera House, whilst the Coghill Bros, have
brought the Oxford prices down to one “ bob ”
and sixpence. Also, the Cambridge theatre is
determined to work itself into popularity, so, in
the face of all this opposition, the Bijou had better
pause and consider.
** * *
At the Royal there is no visible falling-off
in the demand for “The Span of Life.’’ Of late
Mrs. Bland Holt has walked across the span
instead of Miss Hilda Spong, and the span looks
grateful for this new arrangement. Miss Spong
had a way of stopping awhile to ruminate upon
the spine of the middle spanner, and the b-tting
against her sudden disappearance down the yawn-
ing chasm was never more than sto 1. Mrs. Holt
makes the perilous journey with characteristic
sprightliness and a reassuring smile. Indeed,
that clever little lady would have to be in a very
tight place ere her disposition to laugh deserted
her.

Parson Haweis is bettering his Sydney
success at Melb. Athenaeum Hall. The reverend
philosopher and funny man has proved himself
no indifferent comedian, and his two extra
farewell lectures, to-night (Thursday) and Friday,
are expected to produce a state of standing-room
only. The D.aores give two shows at the
Athemeum on Saturday and Monday, and the
Esty-March ooncertists were to start proceedings
in the Town Hall on Wednesday of the present
week.

Joe Dias’ little room at North Fitzroy,
Melbourne, adjoining the Old Colonists’ Horne,
and within a stone’s throw of Merri Creek, contains
relics of a bygone time, when booms were not. Two
ancient playbills hang upon the walls. One, dated
Feb. 10, 1852, is a very mixed bill, presented at
the Queen’s Theatre, Melb., with Mr. and Mrs.
Young in large type. The Youngs starred in
conjunction with Ethiopian Minstrels; also,
Lachlan M'Gowan and Joe Dias appeared in this
special entertainment, whieh concluded with
“The Eleventh Hour, or The Murder on the
Moor.” Horrors were fully described in those
days. A second bill relates to the Montezuma
Theatre, Ballarat, year 1855. G. V. Brooke
played “The Stranger;” George Coppin, too, is
prominent on this tattered curio, and Joe Dias ia
down for a part in “ The Wandering Minstrel.”
An even more interesting document, framed over
the mantelpiece, is a travelling showman’s license
granted to John Musgrave (lie died awhile ago)
and Joseph Dias, in 1858, by Sir Henry Barkly,
Governor. A letter from Buddy's haydekong,
the Wellington of the period, mentioning that the
permit has been posted, adorns a separate frame.
According to old Joseph, the license aforesaid was
the last one issued in Victoria. It entitled him-
self and partner to give theatrical entertainments
anywhere in the province outside Melbourne and
Geelong. No restrictions were imposed upon the
company. They could produce “ Hamlet ” and
do a tumbling act on the same evening, or, if they
preferred to hold a circus, the license offered no
objection.
» * *
Joe Dias is nob a rippling stream of anec-
dote as a rule, but he begins to unburden himself
of old recollections when you get him in the
kitchen. Light wood for the kitchen-tire is sent
down by W. and M., from the Princess’s, it ap-
pears. Scene-frames and the debr/s of “heavy
sets’’ serve to boil the superannuated mummer’s
kettle, and the sparks turn his thoughts to the
profession as they fly upward. Then lie remem-
bers how he was prompter at the Victoria Theatre,
Sydney, in ’54 or '53, and passed the word occa-
sionally to Mrs. Guering. This sounds interest-
ing, because Mrs. Guering is Mrs. Dick Stewart,
and mother of the immortal Nellie. One feels
glad to hear that Nellie’s papa was not even ac-
quainted with Nellie’s mamma, much less married
to her, in ’54 or ’53, which is convincing evidence
against certain sacrilegious creatures who would
make our youthful vision a good 10 years older than
her birth-certificate. Joe Dias nearly burnt him-
self out of the Dramatic Home a few weeks ago,
but, when the angry flames had licked his couch
and devoured his curtains, and started to consume
the premises, Providence sent along a gardener,
who syringed the conflagration and preserved the
old man from a smoky doom. He scarcely at-
tempts to dissemble his natural pride in this melo-
dramatic incident.
The photo, of Capfc. Johnson, of the war-
ship Ringarootna, as printed on page 13 of this
issue, is from a print by Kerry & Co., George-
street, Sydney.
Melb. Trades Hall seceded from the May
Day movement solely because H. H. Champion,
in whom it “hadn’t confidence,” occupied the
position of 00-sec. The southern democracy is
thus divided into two discordant factions clawing
at each other’s hair and eyes. Nobody catches
Fat Man making such an ass of himself as to split
his party at a critical moment over some trumpery
side-issue; it is restricted to the man with hob-
nails on his boots to prove that he has them also
on his brain.
Dooley, the Melbourne savage who chopped
np his wife and mother-in-law with an axe (like
many other celebrities now before the vari-
ous tribunals —he was suffering from syphilitic
brain-disease) took arsenic before his capture, and
died soon afterwards. Thus was the hangman
cheated of his prey. If Mr. Dooley had only per-
formed in Sydney, the law authorities would, of
coarse, have given him lOgrs. of strychnine on top
of the arsenic, and pulled him round—and then
turned him over to “Nosey Hob ” as good as new.
Thanks to its benighted policy of Protection, the
miserable cabbage-garden hasn’t got a grip of the
very first principles of toxicology.
Salomons, Q.C., it is said, was invited to
preside oyer the Dean Commission, but declined—
on the ground of Ins former little unpleasantness
with the Judge concerned. By the way, it will
be a pity if Dean’s case is not conducted before
the Commission by either Salomons or Pilcher,
Q.C’s. With the composition of the Commission
the public is, on the whole, well satisfied, though
it is recognised as anomalous that (the matter
having to some extent assumed a political aspect)
anyone in any way dependent on Ministerial
favor Should take part judicially in the proceed-
ings. Ami, as the issues are of grave moment to a
certain Supreme Court Judge, it would have been
much better had it been found possible to arrange
that the case should not be judged by a practising
barrister of the Court.
The Bulletin has before it a copy of a
disreputable London baronet - conducted thief-
paper called Tit-Bits (visions here arise oi
a scrofulous fat boy eating grease with his
fingers), dated Kith March, 1805, wherein is pub-
lished a three-and-a-quarter-colnmn story headed
“The Little Duchess,” which, a notice, over the
heading states, “has been judged by the arbi-
trators to be the best sent in, and has, therefore,
gained the prize. A cheque of one guinea has
been forwarded to the sender, Mrs. E. Holland,
24 Burnt Oak Terrace, New Brompton, Kent.”
The name of the author is not appended to the
story, and, no notice to the contrary being visible,
it would appear that Mrs. E. Holland, aforesaid,
is the authoress of “The Little Duchess.” Now,
“The Little Duchess” was first printed in last
year’s Xmas number of The Bulletin, and was
the original work of that talented young Aus-
traiienne, Miss Ethel Turner, whom The Bulletin
was glad to have the privilege of paying for her
prettv story. A mail or two ago The Bulletin
got a letter from Sheffield (Eng.) Telegraph
enquiring terms for the rights of “The Little
Duchess ” and any other stories by the same
authoress for syndication in England, whereupon
this paper, not claiming copyright as against any-
one contributing to its columns, referred it to Miss
Turner herself. If Baronet Newnes stole or re-
ceived valuable stolen literary matter taken from
an English paper he would have to pay damages ;
but as Miss Turner happens to be an Australian
writing for Australian papers she cannot claim the
protection of the English copyright law ; for
while English copyright applies to all English
possessions and so runs in Australia, Australian
copyright is not operative in England 1 If the
English thief-papers continue to steal Bulletin
stories without acknowledgment this paper will
take legal means to prevent the issues containing
such stolen matter from being sold in Australia,
anyhow.

Boiled down, the great Australian naval-
court-martial case stands thus. Surgeon Lea, of
H.B.M.S. Ringarooma, sick-listed Capt. Johnson,
of that vessel, on the ground, it would appear, of
alleged mental derangement. Whereupon the
captain charged the surgeon with insubordination,
proved his case (to the satisfaction of a court of
Ids brother captains), and had Surgeon Lea
cashiered. The court refused to hear any evi-
dence as to the captain’s state of mind, say-
ing that what they had to enquire into
was the charge of insubordination only.
Now, the doctor had, under the regulations, full
power to sick-list the captain, and when an officer
is sick-listed (especially on the alleged ground of
mental alienation) he is relieved of duty and is for
all practical purposes just as non-existent as if he
had had his skull sawn open and his brain dropped
into spirits-of-wine. Not that the Court had
to decide whether the captain was mentally
incapable or not; the only question really before
it was whether the doctor acted bona-fide, and
within his duty, in certifying to the eapcain’s
unfitness. If the doctor was able to show full
cause for his action, then the captain, whether
mentally ill or well, had no ground for complaint.
In declining to allow the doctor to attempt to
show cause, the Court acted foolishly and tyran-
nously.

The S.M. Herald’s truculent attitude over
the Dean trial, and its apathy re the flagrant

that in the paper’s veins now runs only just

should be the Herald’s motto.

People are amused at the rupture in a
certain literary household caused by the wife’s
persistence in wearing cycling breeks. She is pen-
woman for a weekly paper ; he indites a column
in a more pretentious organ. Having quarrelled
over the Week dispute, she forthwith proceeds to
attack hubby under a thin disguise in her column
of feminine malice. He responds in his column
with a squelching par. on the asses some married
women make of themselves. They were left
lashing one another as we went to press.

“The police produced the head of the
deceased woman as a piece of evidence,” says a
press telegram, in re the murder in N.Q. of a gin
by a blaekfellow. Now, that was something like
evidence. The Windeyer of those parts might
reasonably declare that he felt as sure that the
murder had been committed as if he had seen it
done.

A queer phase of the Dean poisoning-
case was that the stipendiary magistrate, who
presided at.the preliminary proceedings, seriously
considered the advisableness of dismissing the
charge, on account of the prosecution not having
made'ouc a prima-facie case! And the police-
court evidence was not substantially added to at
the Supreme Court trial.

lb is significant that the presiding Judge’s
notes, as summarised in the S.M. Herald, attri-
bute to Dr. Newmarch this blunt and unqualified
statement (the accuracy of which the Dr. is under-
stood to deny):—
Supposing a person took a dose of arsenic, and then
took strychnine, it would be an antidote to it. Arsenic
deadens the pulse, but strychnine would quicken it.
Then comes this ;
Dr. Geo. Rennie, Government Pathologist, agreed that
the symptoms described by Mrs. Dean were those of acute
arsenical poisoning. Strychnine taken with arsenio
would account for the steady pulse described. Arsenio
deadened the heart’s action ; strychnine stimulated it.
As both medicoes allege that they much qualified
the foregoing statements, it is here plain that in
future the evidence in every capital case should be
reported verbatim.

Apropos the Dean case. In London, years
ago, Edward Layton and his wife were unhappily
bonded. The wife died of arsenical poisoning, a
quantity of the drug being found in her bedroom.
Layton narrowly escaped the rope, and was on
the point of execution when it was established
that the wife had been an habitual arsenic-eater.

“ The solicitors of Sydney ” (says a country
paper) “are suffering more severely than other
professional men. One runs against a solicitor at
every street corner, and the cry is nothing to do.”
Which accounts for a lot of things. Amongst
others, for the fact that a person libelled in
Sydney the other day was interviewed by no less
than eight law-sharks by 2.30 p.m. of the day
after which the libel appeared. They all wanted
to conduct the case.

The perennial rascal who advertises for a
clerk (with cash security) still flourishes. Last
week one of these gentry was tripped up in a Syd-
ney Police-court on two charges of misappropria-
tion, and although in both cases the accused had
aimed at securing =Bl5, and was only partially
successful, the miserably inadequate fine of ,£3O,
or one year’s imprisonment, was all that was
inflicted—a sentence about equal to that of a man

risiter, is applying for admission, and may slip
through with the help of a curious section in the

fessions Act which flies in the face of the time-
honored gag that every man is presumed to know

Dear Bulletin, — A suggestion to Gover-

boozy J.’sP., and it is a shameful fact that there
are at least a score of these gentry in and around
Melbourne available for packing purposes at from
2s. 6d. to ss. a time. In a recent very dirty case,
where defendant was acquitted, the Bench con-
sisted of two or three local J.’sP. and nine itiner-

FREDERICK VILLIERS, artist and war-
correspondent.
Frederic Yilliers, whose portrait is printed
on this page, is due in Sydney by the Warrimoo
tliis week. As war-artist he has a veteran’s
record. He was all through the China-Japanese
campaign, and it was his ninth. He was artist-
correspondent for the Graphic through the
Russo-Turkish war, was on H.M.S. Condor at
the bombardment of Alexandria, and represented
the same paper through the Afghan war, 1878-’BO,
the Nile Expedition for the relief of Gordon, the
Servian and Bulgarian war, and the Burmese
campaign. Yet he is still in the flesh, ever eager
for the fray; and although, thanks to the enterprise
of R. S. Smy the, he has come to Australia to relate
his experiences of the War of the Yellow Nations
before returning to England, and to exhibit his
pictures of the various battles and the taking of
Port Arthur, he a'ready, doubtless, like the war-
house, sniffs more battles not very far off. Thus
he is announced to give his opening lecture in
Sydney Centenary Hall next Wednesday ; but it
is quite possible that before then he will have re-
ceived instructions from Fleet-street to go to a
much bigger war than the last. Forbes, who is
not the most amiable of personages, was always a
staunch comrade of Yilliers. “Whenever,” says
Forbes, “the war-tocsin sounded, it was the
signal, too, of a call from Yilliers to know when I
was setting out; it went without saying that he
and I were to go together.”

light in the clearing-up are three noteworthy and
well-preserved, the first bearing the following
inscription:—
Erected by Henry and Glarind i Parkes to the memory
of their infant children, Mary Parkes, bom Feb. 16, died
Dec. 5, 1846, buried underneath. Thomas Campbell
Parkes, born April 18, died May 5, 1837, buried in St.
Paul’s churchyard, Birmingham. Clarinda Martha
Parkes, born June 23rd, died June 24, 1838, buried in St.
Paul’s churchyard, Birmingham.
The second :
In memory of John Sampson, Esq., sometime Ilia
Majesty’s Solicitor-General for the colony, who departed
this life, deeply regretted, on the 27th Oct., 1829, aged 32
years.
Mr. Sampson arrived as Solicitor-General in
March, 1828. The third tombstone is inscribed :
Sacred to the memory of John Putland, Esq., captain
H.M. ship Porpoise, chief magistrate throughout the
territory and aide-de-camp to his Excellency Governor
Bligh, departed this life Jan. 4, 1808, aged 27 years.
Capt. Putland was the husband of the plucky
lady, Gov. Bligh’s daughter, who stood between
the Governor and the soldiers when the latter
endeavored to depose her father. The captain’s
bones were in the George-st. cemetery, but were

ference—that they get no salary;
a scamped half-hour from a \ bit-

and board and lodging being

Dear Bulletin, Why
don’t men go to church ? T hey
do go. Some churches attract
more men than women ; some
more women than men ; some
attract the two sexes, about,
equally. Taking things all
round, however, there is little
to choose between the sexes.
As a general rule, where the
parson is mild and young and
has his hair parted in the
middle, the women predominate;
and where the parson is bald and
talks much about hell, there the
men are more numerous. The
balder be is, and the more he
talks about hell, the smaller the
female element in the congrega-
tion. —Yours, &0., T.S.

OUT OF RESPECT TO THE GOVERNOR.
What a terrable fuss
There is just now in the bush
About tb u death off
The late Governor Duff.
My wife she’s got a bad atack.
And wanted me to buy some black
For her to wear on the wallaby l rack
Out of respect to the Governor.
I tried to persuade her
But it was no use
That people in the bush
Was though no more off tha i k n raroos,
But I had to give in
And buy her a pair of blacks - ■>•:<! igs
For her to wear on the wallaby t uck
Out of respect to the Governor.
How many in Sydney will we u- black
For which me and my mate-i
Will have to oontrihut a whack.
As for me I pick d up a old co i t
Which apeard to be black
I tore off a strip to make ms a I rip
To itch up my pants and wear it t iere
Out of respect to the Governor.
Our little one died
Before he could toddle
Perhaps no one was sorry
But me and its mother
There was one simple reason-
We did not wear black
Apd that was because we hadn't tiie cash
But that was no fault of the Governor.
Our parsons too of every creed
Will utter a prayer
And with much sympathy feel
Tho they preach and tell us
There is only one heaven
And with the man up above
We are all on a level
On a level with the Queen and the Governor.
But the man that dies on the track
What a different tale
He would be buryed more decent
If he had died in jail
They will bury him there
Without prays or coffin
They will tumble him in as if he was nothing
Without any respect for his Governor.
But how it makes me shudder
For we know he like Duff
Once had a mother
But what can we expect
When the Premier tells us
That a bad man not so good as a dog
So now I will finish my prattle
Without any disrespect for the Governor.

At Poverty Point.
Deoima Moore has cousins in Brighton (Vio.) who will
never have the pleasure of seeing their charming relative
act, as they consider the theatre very wicked indeed.
Miss Massey, of the Gaiety, is siniiularly like the Rose
Massey of 20 years ago, dame of Harry Montague, the
fashionable comedian, and complainant against him in a
breach-of-promise case. There used to be a photo, of her
as a basket of mischief, with her smiling face emerging
from a hamper.
The Melb. Y.M.O.A. liberalises. At its May Day con-
cert two actresses sang: Ida Osborne, and Isabel Webster,
who was in Coppin’s panto.
Pretty actress after rehearsal with one of the Firm’s
companies : “ Williamson says that I shall not he wanted
to do that dance in the second act now. Isn’t itashame?
And after I had got a new yellow silk petticoat to dance
it in, too. Never mind, I’ll take good care that the
people see I’ve got the petticoat, anyhow.” And no
doubt she did.
Maud Hobson never, on any account, gives the audience
a view of her legs in the “ Gaiety Girl.” In the bathing-
machine scene the performers wear cloaks which cover
bathing-suits, some fitting closely to the limbs, and
others which, as in Decima Moore’s case, are baggy
knickers. All the girls but the fair Hobson let the cloaks
flutter apart for a minute or two, but Maud keeps hers
tight round her limbs. As it is of soft, clinging muslin,
however,it does give a little comforting consolation to
the johnnies in the stalls, in the shape of the outline nf a
pair of substantial and shapely pillars, the upper regions
i f which are dimly seen’to be clothed with loose white
silk trouseretles. The Book of Revelations is onlyopened
in the new piece, “In Town.”
The contract between the Dacrea and Phil. Stuart,
which was for a year, has mutually been declared off.
Dacre and his wife, Amy Roselle, are arranging for short
seasons at Adelaide and Sydney, “on their own.” Then,
it is said, they will return to Melb. under “the firm’s”
management.
So far, the Gaiety Co. has returned a good profit to
“ the firm,” but nothing like so substantial an amount
as the Leslie-Lonnen co.’s.
The Comic Opera Co., now in Sydney, was the first co.
formed by Williamson and his partners, 15 years ago, and
it has been the most profitable and successful. It has
survived the competition of a dozen other similar com-
panies, long since dead and buried. Also, it has the
largest repertoire of operas in the world, some 30 in
number. During the eight weeks Sydney season 13 of
them will be produced.
The Melb. bald-heads, discussing the Gaiety girlhood,
plump unanimously for Maud Hobson as a beauty and
a woman ; Johnniedorn elects Grace Palotta, with her
fascinating lips and chic Parisian manners, as its queen ;
the “gods” vote for the leggy and olive-skinned Florence
Lloyd ; the d.c. maidens place their admiring faich in the
fragile, porcelain beauty of Blanche Massey and Decima
Moore; while everybody admits that so large and varie-
gated an assortment of feminine loveliness has never
before thrust itself on the gaze of the Melb. public.
J. O. Williamson, of “the Firm,” has played as a star
in every English-speaking city in the world.
Harry Rickards meditates a trip ’Ome in search of fresh
variety talent. The sprightly Alice Leamar is said to
have already decided to come out again under his manage-
ment.
Item omitted from Melb. version of “The Gaiety Girl. 1 ’
Lady Virginia: “Marriage is an ancient institution;
divorce is a mere mushroom.” Sir Lewis Grey (with a
leer): “ And, like a mushroom, it often springs up in a
single night.”
Charlie Brighton, Augustus Harris’ brother-in law, is
now “doing the colonies,” looking out for new talent for
their London Xmas show. Had he been a few weeks
earlier in Melbourne he might have had Will. Barnes’
Australian Bird Ballet to take back with him. Anyhow,
as the old country is coming to Australia for theatrical
stars it may just as well come for theatrical notions.
Dear Bulletin,— When will some live “variety”
manager rise to the occasion and banish the “serio-
comic ” from the stage for ever? The gallery like it, do
they? It would be interesting to have statistics of just
how many variety connoisseurs—the backbone of such
shows —are driven away from otherwise good combinations
by these hybrid monstrosities. Perhaps the introduction
into the “halls” of genuine, well-trained vocalists like
Norrie, Isabel Webster, &e., may eventually banish the
seriocomic. Another outrage is the “descriptive
vocalist,” who, though he doesn’t, fortunately, get a
show to play Hamlet., always goes as near it as oppor-
tunity allows. — Baldy.
Quite a rage has set in for photos, of pretty and shapely
Ethel Haydon in London. She has sat to nearly every
photographer of note, and some of the pictures of the
egg-shaped little woman which have reached these shores
are simply ravishing. Ethel has filled out and become a
great deal more womanly and “ grown-up’’-looking since
she went ’Ome.
Melba tells how she sang Siebel in “Faust” at a few
minutes’ notice under distressing circs. She hadn’t any
tights for the part, and had to fall back on an extra
capacious pair which the fat Italian tenor had in his
trunk. They were so roomy that the heels of the feet
reached to the fair warbler’s dimpled knees, and she had
to cover the creases up by pinning a long cloak round her
limbs.
Dear Bulletin, —ln his book, “My Musical Life,”
Pastor Haweis quite gives the reader to understand that
he was a very superior player. If I remember rightly, he
says: “ I know I always had the instinct of a virtuoso”;
in'fact, throughout the first portion of the book he makes
no secret of the fact that he was quite in the first flight.
I once asked a celebrated violinist if he knew anything of
Haweis’ playing. He replied : “ Well, he says he is a
great fiddler—and,” he added after an eloquent pause,
“ he is a clergyman.”—M.
Ada Crossiey sings for the first time to a London
audience in June.
It Sydney can’t support two variety shows, it is hardly
likely three will pay in Melb.
Corney Grain, seized with the fatal influenza, the other
day, wrote jocularly to Grossmith that Reed would tell
him the date of the funeral; but it slew Reed, too.
“ Ah, Duke, when you carry out your repressive legisla-
tion against women of evil lives, don’t fail to include in
your schedule the unsympathetic wives. They are the
women whose victims show the sorriest scars ; they are
the really ‘ bad women ’of the word—all the others are
snow-whitejn comparison.”— The Notorious Mrs. Ebb-
smith.
Elton’s first engagement lives fresh in his memory. It
occurred at a small town near Liverpool, when he was
quite a lad. He played for a fortnight, and after the
closing night’s performance he was called into the trea-
sury, where ss. in coppers and threepenny-bits was
placed in his hand. He had agreed for £2 10s., and, as he
had incurred two weeks’ hotel expenses, the unexpected
shrinkage fairly staggered him. In a deeply-depressed
state of mind, and pondering over the misfortunes of life,
he wandered out of the theatre so thoroughly immersed
in his troubles that he walked straight over the bank of
the local canal, and fell into the slush below. He managed
to struggle out of the 4ft. of mud and water, still holding
his heap of coin, not one being missing!
Marie Luella, Polly Emery, Edith Courtenay, Katherine
Hardy, Wheatley, Martin Hagan and his wife go with W.
and M.’s Co. to M.L. A six months’ tour ; shows—“ Cin-
derella ” and “ Red Riding Hood.”
Mrs. Cheveley’s inconsequential remark, in “An Ideal
Husband,” that there had never been any moral sympathy
between Gertrude and herself, because the former lady
“always wore 7J gloves,” is something more than an echo
of Wainwright, the poisoner :—“ It was a dreadful thing
to do,” he said, when reproached for the murder of the
beautiful Helen Abercrombie ; “it was a dreadful thing to
do, but she had such thick ankles.”
“Melba loosens a lark from her bosom, and it soars
upward in song.”— Critic.
Ed. Bulletin,—Wilde's plays are incidental to his
“ epigrams ’’—not the-epitframs to the plays, which are
little more than settings for the superficial cynicisms
which Oscar kept in stock, and which he manufactured,
for the most part, by the simple mechanical process of
standing some common sociological axiom on its head.
Factory-made epigram, in a word—as distinguished from
that spontaneously whimsical correlation of ideas lor
which we have still to go to France. —M.
A strolling co. was in the Q. back-blocks and the actor
billed for the detective gave way to what he called dys-
pepsia. To fill the emergency the local policeman con-
sented to take his place. “ You have only to arrest him in
the usual way,” said the manager, encouragingly. The
cop. grabbed the heavy villain, knocked him down and
leaned on his chest. Then he tore his coat off, searched
it, ripped up his waistcoat and found nothing. After
running his fingers through the villain’s hair, he was pro-
ceeding to see if there was any stolen property in his shirt
when the curtain went down.
Talma, the Melb. photoer, has achieved a splendid
picture of Maie Saqui, in the tableau of “The Morning
After the Ball,” taken at 11.30 p.m., by electric-light.
That odd fish on the boards, Capr. Morin Humphreys,
used to tell in Melb. a yarn about Bandraaim and George
Leopold. Bandmann told George, condescendingly, he
might be a leetle funny, in “The Robbers,” as Spiegel-
berg. In the last scene, at night, Spiegdberg rushed
on with “The soldiers are upon us!” Bandmann:
“ How many, knave?” George: “As many as the hairs
of my head !”—pulling off a red nightcap and showing a
bare scalp.
“ Granville Bantock ” sounds like one of the impossible
names of the “ perfesh,” but G. 8., the musical director
of the “Gaiety Girl” Co., and Leedham Bantock, one of
the comedians of the crowd, are sons of Dr. Granville
Bantock, a West End, London, medico.
An Argus correspondent re the chattering-in-theatres
nuisance: “ It would be charitable to impute their con-
duct to the spirit of democracy abroad in the land.”
Ignorance again—the chattering is always dress-circle,
the “ hush ”is gallery. The cackle and gabble in Sydney
Lyceum dress-circle is unendurable, whereas you could
hear a pin fall in ttie gallery.
Mark Twain is coming to do Australia in the charge of
R. S. Smylhe. Mark will probably be run as a clergy-
man in keeping with Smythe’s joke—running recent
parsons as humorists. Talmage was described as “having
a good deal of Mark Twain humor, with none of his vul-
garity.” The people will find when the “Innocent
Abroad ” arrives that the humor of the Brooklyn pulpit
bruiser was really Twain’s. They already know that his
vulgarity was all his own.
There are now four juvenile minstrel co.’s touring
Melb. suburbs, in addition to six dramatic co.’s (inclusive
of Dan. Barry’s, Charlie Taylor’s, and a contingent from
the Bijou, which plays in St. Kilda). In Colling-
wood Town Hall alone Hayes’, Dan. Barry’s and Charlie
Taylor’s companies are billed to appear on separate nights
in the one week. Ail these co.’s, with the exception of
the Bijou contingent, play to “silver coin” audiences.
In short, the Melb. suburbs are theatrically glutted, and
it is a desperate fight to see which will hold out the
longest. This is “ sapping ” the theatres with a ven-
geance.
Letter penned to Fanny Brough, the entertaining
comedienne and sister of our Robert, by an embryo Aus-
tralian Leslie :—“ Dear Miss Brough,- The one who pens
these lines to you is an Australian youth (19 on the 26th
of this month). For twelve years he has set his thoughts
on the stage, not with the idea of it being a fairyland, but
knowing it to be the place where he knew he could make
a name for himself. Among many artists who have come
to Australia, and who I have seen (giving out pro-
grammes, &c., every night of the season), Leslie, Lonnen,
and Terry have been carefully watched by me. One can-
not do nor say half of what they would like to in any
number of letters, and it sounds very tall talk to say that
within six or seven months I would he able to give Lonnen
a start. Such, however, I feel to be the case. An outsider
like myself has little or no chance to get on the
Stage out here, where, if they want a corpse, they
would seek to get an order to open up the grave of one of
the stage hands’ grandmothers. 1 have not any parents,
some day I may have money, but in the meantime I am
unable to get £l4 14s. to get to England. Tickets can be
sent out to people so as to enable them to join their
friends at home. Could not you get up an art union and
have me for the prize, or, better still, if you send it your-
self. I have formed a high opinion of you from what I
have read of you, the proof of which is the letter. I will
look out for an answer when I think it is due. Wishing
you a happy New Year, &c., &o. P.S.—Trusting for an
early answer and your pardon, should anything be out
of place, as I was in a hurry to catch the overland mail-
train.”
Both the Gaiety Hopes are engaged—one to Decima
Moore and the other to Florence Lloyd.
When parson Haweis lectures on sacred subjects he
dons priest’s garb. Other times he sports faultless
evening dress, with a large ruby in his boiled shirt-front.
The sight of a very lovely woman in the stage-box is
sometimes rather distracting to the actors on the stage.
This was demonstrated the other night in a Southern
theatre, when one of the local belles entered the box with
a party of friends. The hero in the play fixed his eyes on
the lady, and addressed the rhapsodies intended for the
heroine directly at her. It was most embarrassing for
the beauteous one ; and when the audience began to
notice the too-evident admiration of the actor, the lady
retired behind the curtains of the box covered with con-
fusion, and so lost the two best acts and thrilling situation
in a capital play.
In the play of “Charlotte Corday,” Bellew and the
beauteous Potter’s vessel lately had a nasty contretemps
in America. She capsized Marat in the bath, showing
there was no water in it, and Marat was fully dressed.
What a chance to emulate the actor who blacked himself
all over for Othello !
That plucky seronaut, Miss Viola, lately found herself in
a trying situation at Gympie. The balloon caught fire
at the moment of ascent and the aeronaut rose into the
air like a veritable Elijah, off to the heavens in a
flaming chariot. During the ascent the lady calmly
waved her handkerchief to the crowd from her perch on
the trapeze until the balloon attained a height of some
2000 feet and commenced to descend. The parachute was
entangled and acted badly; but Miss V. eventually
alighted safe and sound.
“Tommy” Hudson, just fresh from Hindostan, has
opened with a strong 00. in the usual variety biz. at Perth
Town Hall. “Tommy” ages well ;so do his jokes.
Carlyle Smythe, when in Adelaide with Pastor Haweis,
received a vice-regal shock. He has been used to deal
with the real Governor, and, therefore, was not prepared
to receive the cheque which Mr. Way sent in return for
the seats reserved at one of the lectures.
Dear Bulletin,— Why do we tolerate applause in theatres
and yet eject the person who vocally expresses disappro-
bation? At the first glance, it would seem as reasonable
to hiss as to shout encore, “ but, when you come to think
of it,” the object of a play is to excite the emotions
pleasurably, and any conduct on the part of the spectators
generally conducive to this is permissible. To guy an
actor is sure to detract from his ability to please: an
organised claque, though a nuisance, is hound to encourage
him. Hence, following long-established custom, theatrical
entrepreneurs condone the demerits of the applause-giv-
ing system.— Junor.
On the night when Haweis preached in South Yarra,
the choir of Christ Church sang the anthem, “ The Lord
is my strength.” R. S. Smythe remarks that however
this may be in London, he (R.S.S.) is Haweis’s strength in
this country.
’Tis said that Florence Young intends going ’Ome with
the Gaiety girlhood in quest of a London engagement.
Her place in “the firm’s” co. will be filled by Miss

Florence Lloyd, of the Gaiety Girl Co., is Mrs. Henry
Bracy’s niece.
Williamson and Musgrove evidently don’t regard “ The

Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis’s Hamlet is announced at Melb.
Three others, by ladies, are remembered there : those by
Cleveland, Pomeroy and Rose Evans. Perhaps Mrs.
Waller acted it, in the geologic era of Billy Dind : but
Rignold’s mother oould whip the lot in Hamlet, Romeo
or lago.
Wybert Reeve staged “A Night Off” (in conjunction

“In ‘Gentleman Joe,’ the handsome cabby, Arthur
Roberts has a part after his own heart,” writes The Bul-
letin’s London correspondent, “with abundance of oppor-
tunity for risjue gag and suggestion, especially in his
song • What I saw from the top of my hansom.’ You can
judge what use Arthur would make of such a chance.
For once in a way there is something like a plot, which is a
novelty for Arthur.”

One of the reconstructed banks takes its
deposit-receipts at their face value in payment of calls.
Therefore, the knowing shareholder, instead of paving
cash, buys deposits at a big reduction, and wipes off his
liability cheaply. There are a good many different
aspects to this case. If the bank got its calls in cash and
then bought deposits with the proceeds, it would make
25 per cent, profit for the shareholders, but it is a hard
business to get calls paid in cash, nowadays, so it lets the
shareholder annex the 25 per cent, instead. He pays up
promptly, too, because the deposits keep rising in price,
and he wants to get them while they are cheap, and his
purchases make them keep on rising, so that people think
confidence is really being restored. Also, the promptness
with which the calls come in makes the bank look
healthy, and further assists to restore confidence. And,
in any'case, the concern isn’t likely to pay divs. on its
ordinary capital for the nextseven years, and seven years’
interest saved on the deposit is over 30 per cent., so all
parties feel satisfied.

Several banks which used to publish their
balance-sheets as great two-column advts. above the lead-

obscure corner among the pills and the lost dogs. It is
cheaper, and, besides, the fewer people who see a balance-
sheet the better nowadays.

According to the Australian Tory press, lying
dismally and deliberately in the face of every kind of
evidence, Maoriland, under the most democratic govern-
ment in Australasia, is a miserable and accursed place.
Population flees from it in shoals ; capital is driven away
by the graduated land and income-tax; there is to be an
immense Treasury deficit at an early date ; its financial
legislation outrages all economic maxims. Yet it is this
poverty-stricken province which has turned over a fresh
page in the book of Australasian finance, by floating suc-
cessfully a £1,500,000 loan at 3 per cent.—the lowest rate
at which Australasian securities have ever been accepted
on London market. The Conservative curses turn to
blessings under the enraged prophets’ eyes.
The loan was covered nearly four times, the
total subscription being £5,963,400, at an average price of
£94 Bs. 9d., or £4 Bs. 9d. more than the fixed minimum.
The province thus gets its money at about £3 3s. 3d. per
cent., or 11s. 3d. less than the price paid for the £2,700,000
loan of October last. This improvement in credit is in
the face of all the “disastrous legislation” which has
made the S.M. Herald and Melb. Argus wail so violently,
and in face, too, of the fact that the £1,500,000 is wanted
for the set purpose of advancing money to settlers, in
defiance of all Tory ideas of governmental rights and
duties.
The Maoriland Treasurer now proposes a
gradual conversion of the whole of the province’s debt
into 3 per cent, stock, thus aiming to do single-handed
what it was thought only the treasurer of the Australian
Commonwealth could accomplish. He may have to bonus
investors in order to achieve his object, but the annual
interest saving should more than make up. The market
is exceptionally favorable just now, and if Maoriland gets
over the stile there will be other provinces eager to follow
her.
These remarks apply to conversion schemes only,
and even conversion should be managed locally as tar as
possible. The most successful loan in London is really
a failure, and the more successful it is the bigger
is the failure; for the gain merely serves as an
inducement to these provinces to borrow more
violently than heretofore. The restoration of credit
in London is a curse ; and the best thing
that could happen to Australasia would be the
utter destruction of its British credit now and
for evermore. The Maoriland Government, with its
alleged national policy, should have done its bor-
rowings locally, and not gone back to wallow
in the mire of Vogelism. The new loan will probably
prove a paying investment, but even that does not fur-
nish any excuse for the folly of Seddon and Co. in having
recourse again to the British usurer. Moreover, there
was no real reason at present for having recourse to any-
body. The State’s credit is quite good enough to keep
afloat £1,000,000 worth of paper-money, and that sum
would at least have given the Credit Fonder a good start.

An Australian bank-manager, who is universally
allowed to be the “deoentest fellow going,” earns his
reputation by a simple device. _ He has a lot of letter-
paper imprinted with the heading of “Head Office, Lon-
don.” Assuming that a customer is getting too much
overdrawn, this philanthropic manager has a long letter
type-written in his own office to the effect that “ ths
(London) directors note with alarm that Mr. So-and-So is
far too much ahead, and that unless he can put up
additional security the account must be instantly re-
duced to £ Mr. So-and-So is sent for, and is shown
the letter. Mr. Manager commiserates with him, says it’s
a d d shame, and that so far as he (Mr. Manager) is
concerned he could have another couple of thon., but it’s
more than his position is worth, &c. Is sorry to say it
must he reduced so much. Hence his popularity, yet at
bottom he’s a perfect sneezer.
In these dull times, when money (with the excep-
tion of diva., of course) has almost double the purchas-
ing power it had a few years ago, the gigantic
Colonial Sugar Co. still manages to pay its 10
per cent, to the numberless widows and orphans and
ladies-in-reduced-circumstances, who are dependent on it.
The year’s net profit was £172,829, out of which 20 per
cent, could easily have been paid, but the enormous
amount of £87,830 was carried forward.

The unlucky Orient S.N. Co, made a profit of
£50,800 last half-year, but has to put it to reserve for
depreciation ; and the shareholders once more sigh for
the vanished div. The Chimborazo loss wiped out
£66,800; and the stranded Oroya will probably take five
figures out of this half’s profits. The reserve now stands
at £423,800. As the Orient Co. consistently employs
white labor, while its great rival, the P. and O. as con-
sistently employs black, The Bulletin’s sympathies are
all with the former: and it hopes that the luck will soon
take a turn.

During the past fortnight two reconstructed
banks down South have, by not being in a position to
afford certain of their customers larger facilities than
heretofore, lost at least 15 very choice accounts, w hich
have been eagerly snapped up by non-reconstructors.
The lean kine have only skin and bones left, whilst the
fat banks are getting such good biz. that they are shunt-
ing “weak” accounts altogether. So far as Victoria is
concerned, the “little man” will shortly have no bank at
ail to go to unless he pays for the privilege of trusting a
“ big ” bank with his money.

The Westralian loan of <£750,000 (half the
£1,500,000 “sop” which secured the triumph of the
Forrest Ministry at last year’s elections) was floated very
successfully at an average of £lO3 Is. 4d.—a price for 3J
per cent, stock rarely bettered by any Austra-
lian province. The total amount subscribed was
£2,860,000. With this addition the W.A. debt will stand
at £4,167,339 (including £185,085 Treasury Bills), in-
volving an annual charge on revenue for interest and
sinking-fund of £159,512. The sinking-fund accrued to
June 30, ’94, was £138,531 —not much ; but a good
deal, seeing that S.A., N.S.W., and Queensland have none
whatever. Taking the present Westralian population at
83,000, the public debt will now stand at about £52 per
head, about £4 over the Australasian average, but 120
below the magnificent figures of £72 which represent the
indebtedness of every Queenslander.

The gradual revival of Vic. trade has been
apparent in the real estate market for months past. Even
in suburbs such as Brunswick and Coburg, where houses
could have been had rent-free a little while ago, a decent
dwelling brings a fair rent —as rents go nowadays.
* * * *
The noxious supported-aecount system, respon-
sible in the past for the downfall of many a minor mer-
chant, and which was much curtailed during the past few
years, threatens, with the prospects of renewed trade, to
blossom again in Victoria. The big houses aln ady begin
to snap up any poor devil who may have a hundred or
two, and with glowing promises collar his " ready ” and
plant him in some decayed one-horse township with a
rotten and out-of-date stock not worth removal. But the
smaller city houses, agents, &0., who have been bitten in
the past, trade too cautiously now, and it will take years
before the “ big ” men will be able to work the “ sucked-
orange” game so successfully as of yore.

A pitiful sight in Sydney just now is the terrible
competition between bum-bailiffs. There’s a boom in
their business, but the recruits added to their ranks have
made even this trading on the misery of others a constant
fight to a dead finish. Squads of these professionals
may be seen at set hours promenading opposite a money-
lending establishment. Suddenly Hooknose Eshkvire
appears at a door, and there is a rush and a scramble,
and a threatened battling for first place and employment.
N.S.VV. is turning the corner, and Mordeoohen means to
close down before it does turn it.

A Melb. estate-agent sold a house, and by
appointment waited on the purchaser and his solicitor.
As it was after bank-hours he thought compli lion would
have to be deferred, but was asked to wait till the pur
chaser went across to the Safe Deposit, whence he re-
turned with 500 sovs., the purchase-money. Yet the
Argus does not think private hoards exist to any extent.

Pounce: “ One objection to the amalgamation
of the professions in Victoria, anyhow, is that so many of
the solicitors are ‘ cronk,’ whereas there are but few-
crooked barristers. A certain counsel was offered £2OOO
(£5OO down and balance on finality) to let a certain
accused get ‘potted,’ and promptly refused. How many
attorneys would have jumped at such a chance 1”

The Guernsey market scheme of finance has
often been brought under notice of Australian Parlia-
ments, but as Fatman would rend Heaven with his cries,
were any attempt made to reduce the wages (interest) of
money, nothing has been done. The old bogie of gold
reserve would be trotted out, as though 90 per cent, of
business was not done without it. Interest is falling fast,
and if the Guernsey scheme were applied to works
assuredly reproductive here, it would compel capitalists
to lend to manufacturers at rates that would enable
them to establish industries which, under the present
rates of 10 and 124 per cent., are impossible.

Judge Molesworth, of Victoria, deserves sym-
pathy. He is called upon to administer two Acts-the
Insolvency (an ineffective thing of shreds and patches)
and the Licensing (the worst example of incomprehen
sibie muddle extant). In the Insolvency Court he haa
remedied abuses as far as possible under the circum-
stances, and “cronk ” trustees are being gradually wiped
out. Until a big boomer made a rush and got out by
way of the Full Court, he held the insolvents in fair
check, but now they are making a big race for the gap
made'by the aforesaid bonrjer. In the Licensing Couit
again he does his best, but is seriously hampered by th •
Act’s ineffectiveness and incomprehensibility. To have
to administer two such statutes is enough to kiil any
Judge’s reputation. You might as well tie a man’s arms
and ask him to sprint.

the societies the syndicate proposes to absorb is making

Or any symptoms of a disordered digestive ap-

so safe and sure to give relief as Fletcher’s Pills
and Clements Tonic. Don’t be misled into waist-
ing time and money on any of the “ All-failing
nostrums so speciously advertised by designing
quacks and dishonest rogues. Remember, these
two remedies have stood the test of time, that
their merits are proved, and that a few shillings
invested on tlfem may save you weeks and months
of suffering, and, perhaps, pounds of expense, for
they have done so in hundreds of cases, and we
will send you evidence to prove our assertions on
receipt of your name and address. Remember,
delay is dangerous, and that every hour you
neglect your case the complication increases and
a cure becomes more difficult. Shun the cheap
quack doctors and designing nostrum com-
pounders ; stick to the remedies Clements Tonic
and Fletcher’s Pills. They are absolutely genuine,
and have proved their efficacy in hundreds of
cases and will do so every time. They are sold
everywhere and made only by F. M, Clements,

JUDGE MOLESWORTH,
of Victoria, who thinks and

“Pat” Jennings, M.L.O. (N.S.W.), who
has long been very unwell, is lying in a rather
dangerous state at Petty’s Hotel, Sydney.
The world has, of late, not gone too well with the

physical condition will excite sympathy far and
wide, for, in his heyday, he was the most generous
of men.
Michael Davitt, the Irish patriot and demo-
crat, who sailed for Australia the other day,
has only one arm, and is not unlike John
Burns in ruggedness of countenance. Three
times he has seen the inside of prisons
for political offences, and the other day, in
evidence before the Prisons he
described penal servitude in England as “the
most rigorous, most heartless, and most scientifi-
cally refined system of punishment that the
wit of man could devise.” The extraordi-
nary thing about Davitt is the sincerity
of his convictions. During the Parnellite
split he left his Irish chief, and stuck to Glad-
stone, notwithstanding that it was the G.O.M.
who prosecuted him in 1870, and the same man
who sent him back to prison in 1881. Some
of the best years of his life have been spent
in gaol, and instead of nursing bitterness
and planning vengeance he was thinking out
schemes for the benefit of his fellow-country-
men. He professes the doctrines of Henry
George, and speaks with great fluency and
earnestness. More than any other Irishman he
has labored for the advancement and regenera-
tion of the working classes.
“ Speranza ” (Oscar Wilde’s mother) has
generally got the credit for hav-
ing, from the court gallery, con-

in the course of Duffy’s trial, when
it was sought to attribute to accused
the authorship of a certain article
which appeared in the Nation. It
was Mrs. Callan, editress of the
Nation during Duffy’s detention,
who actually gave the lie to the
lawyer’s assertion in the words,
“ That is not true. I wrote that
article.”
Prior to “Jack” Want’s appearance in
Dean’s case, “Bob” Wisdom was the last Attorney-
General to prosecute in person at Sydney Criminal
Sessions. The case was one of fire-raising, 15 years
ago. A man cold-bloodedly set fire to premises in
George-st. for the sake of the ss. reward given for
first information! and life was lost in the fire.
Justice Windeyer presided. Dunn got a sentence

According to ex-Premier Parkes there are
bub seven members of the old combined IN.B.
Wales Parliament now living : Henry Parkes,
Francis Lord, Charles Nicholson, Augustus
Morris. W. P. Faithful!, Saul Samuel, and Daniel
Cooper. And of these the youngest and most
energetic is Mr. Morris, now a N.S.W. official
assignee.
William Milne, ex-President of the 8. A.
Legislative Council, began his life in the province
in 1839 as a barefooted youth tailing cows in the
district which afterwards returned him to Parlia-
ment. He ran away with his employer s daughter
and married her, his golden wedding having been
celebrated three years ago. He was nob a bril-
liant man. but he was honest. He was reputedly
wealthy. , . . . ,
The death of that accomplished chemist
and metallurgist, Cosmo Newbery, is distressing.
Only 52 years old, he might have been fairly
booked for another 20 years’ work, but for the
Windsor railway smash which first discredited
Speight. Newbery invited his friend Dunn, a
clever professional rival, out to dinner, and they
embarked in the luckless train, which nearly killed
them both.
Justice Windeyer’s father was a leading
Liberal in his day, and was regarded as an
obnoxious Radical by many of his contemporaries.
During his canvas for a seat on the elective branch
of N.S.W. Legislative Council he was, though he
eventually won, bitterly denounced as a man of
dangerous and unconventional opinions. His
obstinacy in resisting a Government tax on one
occasion led to a sheriff’s execution on his domestic
property. .
General Hutton is refreshingly undiplo-
matic and natural. At a military inspection
soon after his arrival in N.S.W. he spoke a few
words of encouragement to the men, whereupon
the local field-marshal, probably a warlike and
aldermanic garter - merchant or sock-vendor,
thought he would congratulate the men too, and
straightway proceeded to do so. The Major-
General stood it with difficulty and raised his
eyebrows very high, but when another held-
marshal or general started to wag his jaw, and it
became evident that all hands, right down to the
little drummer-boy, were going to blather, then
the General arose and spoke in his wrath. He
said—but no matter.
There is one Australian Judge who is
rarely crushed by counsel, yet it does happen
sometimes. In a recent unsavory case the prisoner
was defended by Mr. 0., a barrister apparently
somewhat obnoxious to his Honor, and when that
learned counsel asked a question of which the
Judge did not approve, his Honor first of.all
affected an air of extreme amazement and then
spoke majestically, and in a very loud voice . i
had a long experience myself both at defending
prisoners and prosecuting, but I would never have
asked such a question as that.” “ Ah,’ replied Mr.
0 “other people besides your Honor have had
experience.” Then his Honor, finding that he could
not have his own way, became angry and undigni-
fied : “I tremble for prisoners,” he snapped, with
pointed emphasis, “ when I see them defended by
some counsel.” Whereupon the rude Mr. 0.,
fixing his Honor with a meaning look : ' 1 also
tremble for prisoners, your Honor —but for very
different reasons.” Then the learned Judge sank
back in silence, but he bore his reverse badly, and
in summing up alluded in lachrymose tones and
plaintive snorts to the way in which he had been
insulted when he offered a “most friendly sugges-
tion to counsel.”

Antarctic explorer Borchgrevink tells of a
scientific magnate who tried hard to trip him up
at a meeting of the Melbourne learned, by asking
him conundrums. “ Hid you encounter insect-
life throughout your voyage ?” “ Oh, yes ! the
magnate was triumphant. “ I always understood
that no insect-life existed so far South? Well,
answered Borchgrevink, “ the unfortunate busi-
ness was that we had taken the troublesome
creatures with us.”
Bernard Hall’s picture of the late Vic.
Chief Justice (painted from photos, under great
disadvantages) has been aptly described by a man
about the courts as being neither one of ‘ the
Chief ” nor of “ George Higinbotham. The
statuesqueness of the great democrat is entirely
missing, and there is nothing to suggest that
wonderful mingling of strength and “sweetness
which charmed everyone who knew him. The
picture is stowed away at present in an upper
room of the Court Library, and it is to hoped
that it will remain there. “It’s not him ! ”
J. B. O’Hara, a Melb. University poet,
has a commission to supply a London firm with
material for an Australian birthday - album.
Someone should provide him with a spray
wattle-blossom and the carcase of a dead hush-
man. Apropos of which, Reginald Roe, head-
master of Brisbane Grammar school, joins
in saying “ there is no such thing a*
Australian poetry —it doesn’t exist, in fact.
Which is mere hypercritical hairsplitting, justified
by arguments which would prove also that there
is no American poetry, or no English poetry, or
no poetry at all.
Gregory Blaxlaud, whose exploring prowess
Mount Victorians—Vhforians, it should be—pro-
pose to honor with an obelisk, merits remembrance
for other and more far-reaching achievements.
He was the first to make Australian wines known
in England, obtaining a gold Ceres medal for
samples he submitted there in 1828 ; and he was
also the first in N.S. Wales to systematically
cultivate oaten hay. A Sydney daily last week
confounded Gregory with John Blaxland, whose
statue is found just inside the door of the local
Art Gallery, and who figured for many years as a
self-willed and independent member of N.S.W.
Legislative Council.
Capt. JOHNSON, of the warship Ringarooma
Adelaide believes that it has been left to it
to provide the Australian Rosa Bouheur, in the
person of Mrs. Lermitte, the clever wife of a
leading local medico. The lady quite suddenly
disclosed a talent for painting animals, and an
experienced sportsman said of her pictures of two
of his favorite horses: “She seems to have gob
under the skin, and to have found out all about
their anatomy.’’ Mrs. Lermitte appears to have
painted an excellent picture of Carbine (which
was bought at once fora good round sum); and she
has also most satisfactorily depicted the two
hunters ridden at every meet during the last
season by Godfrey and Miss Blanche Watson, son
and daughter of the veteran starter —Lord and
Lady Hopetoun’stwo inseparable hunting cronies.
It was to these two that the ex-Governor and his
wife made parting gifts of their own favorite
horses, Snowball and Goldtop, in token that they
would never ride with more companionable
friends.

TIRED NATURE’S GREAT RESTORER,
Mr. J. P. Halls, cab-proprietor, Burra, South
Australia, who writes on May 12, 1893 : —As a
testimony of the wonderful efficacy of the cures
effected by Clements Tonic, and as one who has
taken Clements Tonic, I willingly submit the fol-
lowing statement :—Some twelve months since I
contracted a most violent cold and suffering with
pains in the head and chest, back and kidneys.
My water was highly colored, and left a purplish
sediment matter always. I was quite prostrated,
and became very ill; while in this condition I tried
Clements Tonic, and am most truly happy and
thankful to state that before finishing one bottle I
was quite cured, and have never suffered in like
manner since. I am positive Clements'Tonic saved
me from a prolonged illness, or possibly death,
therefore it is with the deepest feelings of grati-
tude I can testify to its admirable qualities.—I
am, yours, &o., J. P. Halls, cab-proprietor, Burra,
S. A.
I can testify to the above facts to my knowledge
to be a true and correct statement.—Thos. Walsh.
Michael Davifcfc honestly says he is coming
to Australia to make money. He lost all he had
on the Labor World, the paper he started in
London, but which soon followed in the wake of
nearly all exclusively labor organs, and died. The
workman does not care for purely labor papers.
He prefers a paper that is of general interest,
whilst being sympathetic to his own cause.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Victorian: “ I back Trenwith' at odds,
for Premier, within five years.”
Rumored that the Vic. railway and lunacy
departments are to be amalgamated.
In the N.S.W. member’s creed:- —“I
believe in the resurrection of the roads and bridges
member.”
Someone ought to write James M‘Cul-
loch’s biography, with the real Higinbotham as a
set-off to Morris’s wish-wash.
Of N. S. W. Parliamentarily-pledged Labor
party, all are members of some trades-union, ex-
cept Law, Loughnane, Kirkpatrick and Smailes.
A loudly-heralded Freetrade meeting, held
at Echuca, Vic., the other night, resulted in seven
orators and an audience of one. It was the most
unanimous meeting on record.
The puzzle is how Service came to be so
entirely out of the disputes in the Higinbotham-
cwm-M‘Culloch era. This gave him such a splen-
did free hand when he re-entered politics.
Q. Colonial Secretary George Washington
Tozer declared, up North, that there were only 11
unemployed in Brisbane. Next day the official
bureau returned the number as 640. The official
bureau is a gentleman.
Jenkin Coles, the wealthy S.A. Speaker,
is leading a National Ass campaign against free
education, payment of members, and direct land
taxation. Years ago, when the now knighted
Jinks was a policeman, he was a violent democrat.
Ex-Premier Patterson comes out of his
shell a bit, dodging round Chambers of Com-
merce, and those places, with tentative speeches.
Patterson is small, distinctly small. His koo-toos
to Turner have been too thin. He is a sort of
converted wolf.
Most desperate underground efforts were
made to have the Dean poisoning case inquired
into under the 383rd section of the N.S.W. Crimi-
nal Law Amendment Act, instead of by Com-
mission. But the public was emphatic, and the
legal straw-splitters went down.
An attempt was made to amend Griffith’s
motion—rejected by 23 votes to 21—against the
admission of aliens to N.S.W. public service, by
substituting “bacchanalians” for aliens, thus
showing the genial influence of Oliver Wendell
Holmes on the political desert.
After wasting over 200 words in a telegram
to S.A. Premier Kingston, in historical recapitu-
lation, comment, explanation and recrimination,
Premier Turner (Vic.) concluded: “I deem it
best to allow you to have the last word, and there-
fore simply acknowledge your letter.” A superb
bull!
Premier Turner, snorting over some Argus
reflections re his connection with the defendants
in the “ big gun case,” said, in his anger, that he
would rather have thrown over the Premiership
than have deserted his clients. Which is quite as
much justification as the Argus could possibly
wish for.
Wanted, a democratic member of every
Australasian Legislative Assembly to move the
following resolutions : “ (1) That, in view of the
intelligence that the British Premier intends to
introduce in the Commons a bill permitting
‘ colonial ’ Judges to sit upon the Judicial Com-
mittee of the Privy Council, this House resolves
that, so far as the province of Blank is concerned,
the proposal is unnecessary and unwise. (2) That
the Governor be requested to communicate the
foregoing resolution to the British Government.”
It is better, instead of waiting till the Jingo plot
is mature, to stifle it with firm fingers now.
The ironworkers of Mary-
borough (Q.) wished the Boodle-
wraith to compel all persons
erecting mills under the Sugar,
Works Guarantee Act to get
their machinery made in Q.
The Govt, is not willing, any-
how. The ironworkers logically
urge that they have as much right to
protection as the planters.
An Argus cable reports that the Times
“ compliments Mr. Howard Willoughby upon Ins
article dealing with the coming failure of State
socialism,” recently published in the Argus.
Howard Willoughby is a conspicuous ARGUS-man
—and isn’t he Melbourne correspondent for the
Times?
The defeat of N.S.W. Local Government
Bill gives Premier Reid an opportunity, which
some of his friends urge him to take, of so greasing
the constituencies with giftsof “roads and bridges”
that, in the first place, he will demoralise his
political enemies; and, in the second, arouse
public indignation against those who voted against
the Bill—even such as it was.
The Vic. Railway Commissioners con-
sulted Crown Solicitor Guinness as to whether
a prosecution would lie against an ex-M.P. who
was alleged to have illegally travelled on a mem-
ber’s pass. Gist of answer : “No, unless the ex-
member travelled on the pass with intent to
defraud.” Presumably the intent to defraud is
just as obvious as that of the man who travels on
r tqbacco-tag.
Gov, M‘Gregor asserts that the New
Guinea natives are not to be dispossessed of their
lands, and yet asseverates that they will prove
very useful to the European planter. Surely the
Gov. must know that a native settled on his tribal
lands will work regularly for nobody. By the
way, Minister Byrnes asserted the other day at
Mackay that the Queensland planters still look to
New Guinea for labor.
The quidnuncs say Premier Turner will
resign after next session, but nobody has the
faintest idea that he will be thrust out, after
financing the province so ably. He begins to see
that when he has squared off things he can retire,
make his pile in business, and come again when
he likes, as the man who saved the nation. But
Sir George and Lady Turner must come first.
S.A. returning-officers refuse to register
women as voters for the Leg. Council on the
strength of a claim as “joint tenants” or “joint
owners ” with their husbands or brothers of pro-
perty of sufficient annual, or fee-simple, value to
qualify both. Yet two men under similar circum-
stances would be registered without demur, and
the Act says that women shall receive the vote
on exactly the same terms as men.
Near Penola (S.A.) over 60 families make
good livings on land owned by Squatter Riddoch,
M. which five years ago was virgin soil,
looked after by one boundary-rider. Mr. Rid-
doch, fearing land taxation, had his run sub-
divided. The land consists of beautiful volcanic
soil, and was originally sold by S.A. Govt, for
10s. an acre—another illustration of the folly of
the State parting with the fee-simple.
‘ ‘ How do the Maori women use the fran-
chise?” asked Fitzgerald, ex-M.L.A. (N.S.W.), of
Hone Heke, M.H.R., the other day. “Splen-
didly,” said Heke ; “ every one of them votes.”
“For any candidate they choose?” “Oh, no;
just for whoever their chief nominates.” The
whole of Ngapuhi (Heke’s tribe) womanhood voted
solidly for him—but then he is very young, very
handsome, very clever, and very unmarried.
The removal from the Bench of an Aus-
tralian Supreme Court Judge is difficult, but not
the impossible thing which some people suppose.
Justice Willis, who opened the first Court in
Bourke-street, Melbourne, and whose rank was
that of second Puisne Judge, was complained
against as not possessing the confidence of the
public, his petulance being the chief objection, and
was, after investigation, formally removed from
the Bench. Though present conditions differ, the
precedent is valuable as showing that, when the
public has a will, it can always make a way.
The fine of £2O, lately imposed on the
Queanbeyan gaoler, for neglecting to supply
the Circuit Court with a full list of prisoners in
his charge, was on appeal confirmed by the Full
Court, but has now been, by an unexplained con-
junction of influences, wherein Lieut.-Gov. Darley
and O’Sullivan, M.P., take the lead, remitted.
N. Wales now possess so many different
kinds of legal tribunals—lay, ecclesiastical, and
military, with such varying and mystifying pro-
cedures, all topped by a star-chamber finale—that
it is impossible to say where any trial will
definitely end.
That the financial statement of N.S.W.
Premier Reid to-night (Thursday, May 9) “ with-
out fail ” (bar accidents ?) is likely to contain a
surprise or two, is evident from the fact that,
despite the Premier’s emphatic assertions that he
is “going the whole hog ” in Freetrade, Sydney
D.T. says, without a muffler: “The destruction
of the Local Government Bill will seriously dis-
rupt the tvhole financial policy of the Ministry,
and hinder the present carrying out of their man-
date from the people." Eugh ! In other words:
FACILIS DESCENSUS .
“Yes, it’s the way with all us chaps. Came to this pub. three days ago with thirty notes.
First day, it was the bar-parlor; the second, the blanky bar itself; and the
third, the double-blanky wood-heap you see me at."
“Hedge, dear boy, hedge. We’ll invent excuses
for you.”
Sydney Telegraph : —“ Many Maclean
(N.S.W.) Freetraders are assisting in the move-
ment to oppose the abolition of the sugar-duty.”
Of course they are. The Maclean Freetrader
lives, directly or indirectly, on the sugar-industry,
and every Freetrader wants Protection for his own
industry. The only difference between him and
the Protectionist is that he doesn’t want protec-
tion for anybody else’s industry. To state that
the Maclean Freetrader wants the sugar-duty
retained is just as needless as to mention that the
Freetrade Telegraph, though it objects to subsi-
dising local industries in general, approves of
being subsidised itself by free postage.
The Q. Patman
is organising for the
next general elec-
tion. Funds are
available for a close
scrutiny of the rolls
in every district,
and in the West
workers are kept
on the move so that
they shall not put
in the six months’
residence necessary
to qualify for enrol-
ments. If the De-
mocratic - party is
not galvanised into
action, the Nelson
element will con-
solidate its ma-
jority, weeding out
the doubtfuls.
The chief ob-
jection to O’Sulli-
van’s proposed Bill,
whereunder a mem-
ber of one branch of
N.S.W. Legislature
may attend the
other branch to ex-
plain a measure he
has introduced, are
that it will be abso-
lutely valueless in
respect of conse-
quences, and that it
formally recognises
an existing piece of
farcical h u m'b ug.
What real conver-
tive effect has any
speech ? What good
would Jacob do
with one of his Bills
in the Assembly, or
O’Sullivan with one
of his in the Coun-
cil ? Then, again,
each House in Aus-
tralia knows what
the other House
does, and the send-
ing of a member
from one to the
other to explain
matters would be
to perpetuate the
state of humbug
which is now barely
tolerable.
Dear Bulletin,—lf “Jack” Want’s con-
nection with the Dean case, first as prosecutor and
afterwards as a member of the Executive Council
considering on commutation of sentence, is a shame-
ful illustration of the indecency of the Attorney-
Generalship being a political office, how much
more so is the position of the Yio. Attorney-
General, as pourtrayed by you last week ?
J
counsel for the defence of a firm condemned to
pay a large sum for infringement of patent; and
then the Crown officer whose duty it became to
consider whether or not his clients should be pro-
secuted criminally by his Government! The
conscience of any man who can undisturbedly
accept two such positions (and the payments
attached to them) is simply beyond the under-
standing of common sinners like —Yours, D.
The N.S.W. Ministerial concession of a
commission to inquire into the Dean case was a
back-down on all-fours with that which led to the
hasty commutation of the man’s original sentence
with a view to prevent discussion in Parliament.
The Ministry has done the right thing in the
wrong way. N.S.W. will never be properly

governed until it possesses a Premier who, reck-
less of consequences, will stand up in the Assembly
and heave a thunder-blast right away at any
Judge who dares to bring justice into contempt
by such outrageous proceedings as have frequently
characterised the criminal division of the N.S. W.
Supreme Court. What, The Bulletin asks,
would happen to the administration of the law
were every division of the Court's jurisdiction
brought into the public odium which followed the
(not to mention others) Mount Rennie and Dean
cases ?
Rosebery intends to convene another
Colonial “silken-bond” Conference in London
this year. The most recalcitrant Republican at
the Antipodes becomes quite tractable when
gently tickled at Windsor and battered at
Sandringham. The last big Conference was
that of ’87, which ruined Griffith ; and there
are at least two big men now needing to be
similarly bulldozed — Seddon and Kingston.
Wobbler Reid is of no account —his price can be
paid at any time if he lasts long enough to make
it worth while; but the others are more uncer-
tain. By all means, then, another “Conference,”
and let the Jingo spider smear her flies before
devouring them.

A big mining sal© may be invalidated owing to
the quorum of the vending co.’s directors including an
individual who was, it is averred, illegally on the board.
The vending co.’s articles of association stipulate that a
director becomes ineligible if he becomes “ bankrupt or
compromises with his creditors.” This director is said
to have privately compromised, by arrangement, soma

companies, on which he has been a leading spirit since his
compromise, that could be challenged on aim bar grounds.
Thera was an apoplectic bailiff in possession of
the lower floor premises of a certain insurance co., the

get fresh air, but lie did so at such irregular intervals
that the clerks in the offices of the building that
f&es the insurance co. were engaged nearly all day on
time wafers as to the exact moment the hummer would
come up. One shrewd clerk, who endeavored to square
the bummer to arrive at preconcerted moments, lost over
J3lO in wagers, owing to the bailiff having a fit—possibly
on account of the co. paying him out.

Lately judgment for a large amount was given
against a firm who, ere the successful plaintiffs could

very trifle, that was fheir loss and their business. Also,
that the rather trifling sums they had sold very valuable
assets tor were all expended in feeding the lawyers who

" Abrahams’ bosom ” must have been an un-
comfortable place after the £5500 verdict of Saturday
week What to do? was the agitating question. Another
big claim by Elev, the cartridge-manufacturer, was to be
brought forward, and another gun-maker threatened
them with an action. There was, besides, the criminal
prosecution for a conspiracy to defraud to be met.
’Tia said the Abrahams will move for a new
trial on the ground of excessive damages and “against

In the United Kingdom, at the end of 1893,
423 gas-works were owned by companies and 192 by
municipalities. Municipal ownership « steadily in-
creasing ami is an all-round success. In 1888 (the last
vear for which figures are available) municipalities
charged, on the average, 2s. lid. per 1000 feet against
Hs 4d4 charged by private enterprise ; they worked more
economically! their exp-nses being 2s. Id. for every 1000
feet manufactured against 2s. 3d. by private enterprise,
and they produced £1,400,000 profit, which went to relieve
the local rates. Yet the Australian Fat Man paper keeps
on rising to state the old, old lie that municipal enter-
prise has been a failure wherever attempted, and that the
bloated monopoly is the only true road to happiness.
Rumored in Melb. that the local big retail
drapery houses will shortly dispense with the Saturday
half-holiday and keep open until 6 p.m. If this happens
an extension to 10.30 p.m. will quickly follow.

Harcourt’s British Budget shows a surplus of

doesn’t seem much in an income of 94J millions. The 6d.

deficit of £319,000, and a decreasing consumption of
whisky will be checked, if possible, by a 6d. per gallon
duty reduction. t ,
F : “A phrase that is very popular with com-
batants in the currency tangle is “demonetisation of
silver.” It is used constantly, and with an emphasis that
is very convincing. But the statement that silver was
demonetised in 1873, or about that time, is altogether
misleading. Not an American dollar, or an Indian rupee,
or a French franc, has been demonetised. There is more
silver legal-tender money in the world than ever before.
I am reminded of the immoral use of this phrase by bear-
in'' the S.A. Treasurer in Melb. lecture to the unemployed
on how to increase the price of the necessaries of life.

The oableman alleges that
have a gold currency. The Czar coined £477,519 in gold
imperials and half-imperials during ’93-an inconsiderable
quantity. The cable news means either that he , lB *°
strike a new coin to his own glory, to restore the depre-
ciat. d paper rouble to par, to adopt gQ'd mcnMieta sm
or, more likely still, he is going to do nothing more in the
money line than spend the taxes. Russia has a State
hoard of about £100,009,000 sterling in gold, which is
generally reckoned as lost to the world’s currency.
Numerous wild guesses have been made at the reason for
this vast hoard. It is either a war fund or a fund to re-
establish the currency, say the knowing ones. But hard
cash can be used at a moment’s notice for the purpose of
the moment, and the Czars have mostly known enough to
keep money about them. Russia may be deciding for
gold monometallism, as Germany did 22 years ago, and
Austria, Chili, Afghanistan (!), and Japan have done
since. If Russia does this, the bi-metallists will have
something new to say, or will be expected by the other
side to say something new. In the meantime, Russia’s
population worries along with a paper rouble depreciated

Westralia breeds suspicion prolifically. The
legend about the nine men who made a big find in the
Far North-West, and thereafter had their meals and camp
apart to avoid murder by poison, is an illustration to the
point. No man on that side willingly confesses to having
found gold. It is naught, it is naught, saith the digger,
but when he is gone he boasteth. Once home again the
digger boasts of the high quality of his gold. But
Westralian alluvial gold is only fair quality. The frequent
digger-story that the banks gave him £4 2s. fid. an ounce
is pure fiction. There are no reliable statistics published
of the value of gold on the various fields—but The Bul-
letin has some figures before it, obtained from a reliable
source, concerning gold from various fields.
It must be premised that the figures do nob
relate to gold in the rough. The characteristic red earth
that clings to the alluvial gold out yonder can only be
economically taken out in the melting-pot. The assayer
nuts the parcel, with the usual flux, into his crucible and
melts it. When the result has been poured and has cooled
it is assayed. This gives the value of the gold in a cleaned
state. The parcels “lose” variously, up to 5 per cent.
The “ loss ” is generally less in winter, or when water is
used. &0., &c., so the quotation of values gross would be
misleading. Here are the values (after melting) of cer-
tain parcels of gold actually assayed
Coolgardie, £3 19s 9d, £3 17s lid, £3 18s 6d

Murchison, £3 19s 7d, £3 18s 9d, £3 18s lOd
White Feather, £3 17s Id, £3 16s fid, i 3 17s 7d
It must be remembered that the amount realised per oz.
on the digger’s parcel would be Is. to 3s. fid. less, accord-
ing to cleanness.

One grievous burden of Australian mining is
the cost of dynamite. It is made for 4d. a pound in Ger-
many and other parts of Europe, as well as in America,
where it is retailed at fid. ; but in Australia, where the
price is controlled by a convention, it varies only between
Is 8d and Is. lOd. This is an outrage. The consump-
tion in Australia must he at least 2000 tons a year which,
in round numbers, costs a quarter-million sterling too
much. , , * »
The veteran Lansell is preparing to sink the 180
shaft at Bendigo to 4000 feet-only awaiting a trial
of his new idea of lifting water bv compressed air, taking
the weight of the water off the valves every few hundred
feet Success is doubted by many practical miners, but
T.anaell is giving it great attention and, although he
never goes below, he knows all details and spends much
time at the mouth of the shaft.

Time and tonnage tell on small gold-reefs. The
West Volunteer (Tas.) shares have backed from 60s. to 30s.
Too late for many people, it was found they struck the
reef in one of the rich shoots. That noh 10-oz. crushing
could not be kept up, and now the mine wants a new
shaft, a new lift and more backs. Blessed are they who
know enough to sell at the top. A good mine, neverthe-
less, when the new manager gets ahead of his work.
The Volunteer, too, has nob enough ground
opened up to blow about, and proposes to take out some
crushings by means of an “ intermediate, dragging it
out per windlass rather than wait until the levels are
pushed ahead. In every other respect the mine is well
handled. ,

Dear Bulletin,—Re Tasmania G.M. ; your last
figures published are 0.K., but they are misleading. The
mine—ask “Billy” Jones-is better than she looks
in vour column. She is a really magnificent property,
but is “religiously” mismanaged, as is locally
well-known. Several years’ tailings from her batteries lie
distributed over a wide area in an arm of the River
Tamar, where they are so mixed with slurry as
not to be payable. The directors bless their
innocent little hearts-are now erecting a Luhng,
and patching up their old battery where neigh-
boring stamps once fell together as best they could,
the cams not having been properly adjusted. Beacons-
fleld rock is softer than Bendigo stone, yet a Bendigo
stamp crushes a third more than its Beaconsfleld-brother
in an equal time. There has been much waste of
time all through the mine-not. mind you,
that any one of the directors has ever been co f , ’ s^'°'J i 9 '7
extravagant to the extent of a sou. Heaven forefend!
The mine was bought for a song, and has been more or
less mismanaged to some tune almost ever since—prob-
aldv a hymn-tune. Fact is, some honest and well-inten-
tioned and even clever people know more about a gospel-
mill than a gold-mill. —Theta.

A very puffy West Coast mine-manager once
landedi n a N.Q. camp, blowing his trumpet loudly with
the object of bringing down the local Jericho. He was®,
marvel of a manager at one end and a metallurgist at the
other end, besides being the trusty parasite of some
millionaires. But he came to grief as soon as he d got
steam up at the battery. Taking up a lump of sodium
he started to rub the plates. Then a fact of chemis-
try was driven into him quickly, for an explosmn f -
lowed, in which he, fortunately, escaped with the loss of
his hair and some skin. Then the legal manager -ung

Leslie Norman, Coolgarrlie, writes
that Tub Bulletin “ occasionally does that Held an injus-
tice says there are 20 mines within a radius of 15 miles
the success of which may be regarded as certain. Bur-
bank’s, according to this authority, is a “ tidy little pro-
perty of great promise.” Tindall’s is one of the absolute
certainties of the field(Mr. Norman is managing-director);
Bayley’s is good enough for a consistent milling show.
The Westralia and New Victoria “ are mines of the finest
calibre,’’ and we are told that “ the Bendigo-Coolgardie
should turn up trumps under better management. The
latter statement quite upsets Leslie Norman. The mine
was opened by as good a miner as ever left Bendigo, auu
the writer, having seen the show, knows it to be a duffer,
which could only be redeemed by striking a richer reef.
Better management! A good mine at Coolgardie will
stand a lot of bad management. This M.A.I.M.K. con-
cludes: “I suppose no one doubts the value of Mount
Bur<>-ess mine?” The Bulletin is beginning to very
much doubt it. Like hundreds of Short-lived mines, it
started well with several ounces to the ton. Already it
is under an oz., and another fall it cannot stand.

Marks, now in London reporting on Coolgardie
mines, has had persistent hard luck in gold-mining.
Israel generally has—how is it? He succeeded in winning
what was considered a valuable lease from George Lansell
on Bendigo, a few years ago. It proved worthless. At
Coolgardie he was one of the employes of the London-
derry owners, and was laid down with fever just when it
began to dawn upon him from their conduct that they
had something remarkably rich about the lease. The
dolly was at work about this time. After he came out of
the hospital its richness was disclosed. He arranged to
peg the West Block at daylight, and found that young
Carter and Dawson did not wait even for daylight. He
lost the chance of making thousands by waiting an hour.
Poor Marks ! Why is the mozzle of the tribes so per-
sistently “out” in gold-delving?

How a well-seasoned Westralian sold his mine.
He first banked lOOoz. ; after a few weeks drew it out,
added 500 z., and banked the lot next day—each time
taking a receipt for the amount of gold which was only
left for safe-keeping, saying he intended leaving the held.
These tactics he pursued until his receipts represented
a good total, and a big bag of specimens was always handy
at the mine. In the end, a big cash sale.

hydraulic co.’s have made nothing out of it. The Spa

Criticising “ Mortgaged Years,” an alleged
Australian story, by R. K. Dee, that weekly

Oscar Wilde’s trial resulted in a disagree-
ment of the jury, and he will be tried anew on 20th
May. Meantime, he is set free on an aggregate bail
of ,£5OOO. It is worth noting that British justice is
still, in some respects, superior to much of the
Australian variety. Wilde’s Judge did not hesi-
tate to remind the jury that the evidence against
him, after all, was only that of hlackmailers-and
how much was a blackmailer s oath worth . Of late
in Australia we have had a Judge who, instead of
laving stress on the fact that one of the witnesses
against a prisoner capitally arraigned was of note-
riously immoral character, seemed to rather seek
to minimise the fact, and seemed to grieve that
the prisoner’s counsel had the bad taste to refer to
such matters. Likewise, his Honor went out of
his way to discount the unquestionably good char-
acter enjoyed by the accused.
Some samples of alleged Vic. Govfc.-
stamped butter, supposed to be pure, have been
found, on analysis in England, to contain from 14
to 17 per cent, of foreign fat. This, however, was
no doubt added in England, where there are manu-
factories which turn out as much as 50 tons of
margarine apiece da.ly—the materials being beef
suet, milk, and nut oil. English purchasers of
Australian fowls complain, too, that a number of
alleged Vic. “ chickens ” were merely tough old
birds with the spurs cut off. And only the other
day a Tasmanian fruit-exporting association had
to complain of one of its members packing off
miserably small apples, to the detriment o the
general trade.
The Earl of Pembroke, who only the other
day wrote the preface of Louis Becke’s “ By Reef

authorof that charming book, “South Seaßubbles,
and took high rank in Europe as a naturalist.
The Ear), who was extremely rich and good-
natured, had for some time been very ill,
apparently with a gastritic trouble; but in a
recent letter to Sydney he hoped for better things
than so sudden an ending.
THE HISTORY OF A SCAR.
On the bank if my right hand —just about the
middle of it—there is a small scar, half as big as
a threepenny piece perhaps. You would never
notice it unless I showed it to you, and even then
you would have to look sharp to see it. But it s
there, all the same, and will be until t e hand is
returned to dust. It dates back forty years, that
scar does. Going home from school one day
another boy and I quarrelled and fought. Strange
to say, it wasn’t about a girl either. Anyway he
drew his jack-knife and stabbed me in the back ot
the rig n t hand. The wound, I remember, was
slow to heal. It was sore and inflamed for month?,
and hardly a day passed but something hit it, or I
knocked it against something, and so made it
worse. My whole available body appeared to be
concentrated in that sore. You know how such
things are. They are like boils, and if th-reis any
comfortable spot to have a boil there are loads of
money waiting for the fellow who discovers it.
Lately we have received two letters, both con-
taining an identical expression, namely, this:
“ Every thing seemed a trouble to me." Now, none
of us are so tough as to be proof against trouble,
but when everything is a trouble to a man the very
heart inside of him must be tender and touchy.
And, mercy knows, it is so often enough. Grief
will do it, worry will do it, and illness too.
One of these letters, or, at least, the writer of it,
goes on to say;—“lt was in March, 1880, that I
felt tired and languid, and without my usual
energy. Before that I had always been strong
and active. Now I was low-spirited and melan-
choly ; everything seemed a trouble to me. At
first I had a bad taste in the mouth, a poor
appetite, and all I ate gave me great pain in the
chest and sides. Even fish and poultry gave me
as much distress as more solid _ food. I was
constantly spitting up a sour, acid fluid which
caused a miserable feeling in my throat and
mouth. , ,
“After I had been for some time in this con-
dition I was attacked with gout in ray hands and
feet, which confined me to the house now and
again for a week or two at a time. The parts
became inflamed and swollen, and gave me excru-
ciating agony. I could not bear anything to touch
them. For four years I was subject to these
attacks. The doctor who attended me was able
to ease me temporarily, but I was soon as bad as
ever. _ , ,
“ In the middle of April, 1888, I read that cases
like mine had been cured by Mother Seigel s Cura-
tive Syrup, and I thought I would try it. I hadn t
taken more than half a bottle when I felt relieved.
This encouraged me to keep on with the Syrup,
and in a comparatively short time all symptoms of
the disease left me. Since then I have enjoyed
excellent health, and whenever I feel a twinge of
my old enemy a dose or two of Mother Seigel
soon sets me right.—Yours truly, (Signed) M.
Leahy, 49 Grosvenor Terrace, Grosvenor Park,
Camberwell, London, September 22nd, 1892.’’
So much for the facts as Mr. Leahy felt them.
What has science to offer in explanation of them ?
This. Gout, rheumatism, and biliousness are three
complaints arising indirectly from an overworked
liver, or, more properly, from indigestion and
dyspepsia. The poisons so engendered may lie
hidden and unfelt for a long time, and then be
suddenly rendered active by mental worry,
exposure, over eating, wrong eating, or any of a
dozen other causes. The kidneys fail (following
the stomach and liver), the acid poison remains in
the blood and sets up inflammation in the joints,
and the retained fluids produce dropsy. All sorts
of disturbances are apt to go this condition
of things, every one less a disease in itself than a
symptom of the one cause— indigestion and
dyspepsia. The heart and lungs are often attacked
in sympathy. Cure the torpid digestion, and an
all round improvement at once succeeds. To do
this is in the power of Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup—as, perhaps, in the power of nothing else.
It was most unfortunate that this gentleman
suffered for eight years; and no wonder, mean-
while, that his mind was sensitive as his body to
every approach. Knowing what he now knows he
feels safe. There is no darkness but ignorance, and
the German Nurse shows “The way out.”

Some of the Sydney nobodies bid, at the
late Govmentouse auction-sale, nearly twice as
much for effects as they cost when new.
Boy newspaper-runners combined, a few
nights ago, to drive girl newspaper-runners off the
Sydney streets, contending that a girl’s proper
sphere is the home and that it demoralises her to
enter into competition with boys. The ‘‘com-
bine,” which lasted about an hour, was supported
by all John Haynes’ and several other arguments
against women’s rights.
An unknown foreigner was run in to the
Sydney Central lock-up the other day, charged
with being drunk. He gabbled some gibberish,
but was cast into a cell. At 3 a.m., something
about him struck the officials as an out-of-the-way
phase of intoxication, and lie was carried off to
Sydney Infirmary. The authorities there declined
to receive him, and he was hawked back to the
cells. At 6.30 a.m., he was in such unmistakeable
extremity that he was taken again to the hospital
and admitted. He died within an hour. And
no inquest was deemed necessary !
A new amalgam has been discovered
which is a wonderful substitute for gold. It con-
sists of 94 parts of copper to six parts of antimony.
The copper is melted and the antimony is added.
Once the two metals are sufficiently fused, a little
magnesium and carbonate of lime are added to in-
crease the density of the material. The product
can be drawn, wrought, and soldered, just like
gold, which it almost exactly resembles when
polished. Even when exposed to the action of
ammoniacal salts or nitrous vapors it preserves its
color. The cost of making it is about a shilling a
pound avoirdupois.
BILIOUSNESS, LOSS OF APPETITE, AND
general debility : —“ln testifying to the value of
ENO S ‘ FRUIT SALT,’ I have great pleasure in
pronouncing it to be a most efficacious remedy in
cases of biliousness, loss of appetite, and general
debility. I have tried all kinds of Saline at
different times, but none of them have afforded
me that speedy and lasting relief which makes
such a feature in your ‘FRUIT SALT.’ You are
free to use this letter in any way you think most
c mvenient. It comes quite unsolicited, and
many of my friends are willing to endorse the
remarks made therein. —S.G.S., Epping, Essex.”
Caution. —Examine each bottle, and seethe capsule
is marked “ENO’S FRUIT SALT.” Without
it you have been imposed on by a worthless imita-
tion. Sold by all Chemists and Stores.
Dear Bulletin, — Re critic Craig's recent
allusion to “ prose tales told in verse.” What are
the best poems in the English language but prose
tales told in verse? Most readers will agree that
a good story dressed in rhyme is like a pretty
woman in a well-made gown—all the better for it.

The Australian explosive Ripp-Lene has
proved a success in India. Mr. Harold Boyd, the
inventor, has now gone to Egypt to clear the
track on the new Syrian railway, and arrange for
placing Ripp-Lene in the tunnel to be cut through
the Nubian mountains as a water-way for the Nile.
It is alleged that ex-Premier Stambouloff,
of Bulgaria, is the only politician who ever rang
up his monarch on the telephone. Stambouloff
was a genius, but he was also a hulking person
with no manners, and his sovereign—who has fifty
pairs of embroidered pants, and several hundred
garish waiseoats, and belongs to the cult which
languishes over the lily—sacked him as a con-
sequence.

THE RABBIT INVASION!
Melbourne Age of 12th February, 1895, published the following telegram
Albury Monday.— Good evidence is forthcoming that some recent bush fires in the northern part of Riverina
have been occasioned through the ignition of the phosphorus used for rabbit poisoning. A fire winch is supposed to
have originated by this means destroyed over 30,000 acres of glass.
Itsgr- taya the only scientific destroying specific, has no inflammable constituents. TOXA WILL NOT
IGNTTK either spontaneously or otherwise. Horses, Cattle and Sheep WILL NOT BAT TOXA. This poison
is SAFE, EFFIC ACIOUS and CHEAP ; cheapness is incompatible with risk or uncertainty. Half-a-crown s
worth of TOXA has poisoned 550 Rabbits. Write for particulars.

The last turn of the rack, in Melb., is the
P.O. bells excruciating “Sweet Marie I Sweet
Marie!”
It is said that what appears to be an elderly
invalid gentleman, driven once a week by a foot-
man in by the back way to a Melb. hotel, is really
a figure filled with illicit spirit.
A burglar lately broke into a Melb.
Chinese store, and got away with what appeared
to be the strong box. On opening it at home, he
found—a complete skeleton! No beans, only
bones !
Melb. matrimonial agencies are evidently
profitable concerns, judging from the fact that
one leading matchmaker has expended .£3OOO in
new premises, gorgeous furniture, &c., for the ac-
commodation of clients.
What the recent local meeting of the Aus-
tralasian Association for the Advancement of
Science did for Brisbane. Young lady, leaving
hall at end of session ; “ Well, I am glad I
attended those science-lectures. I met two of the
most fascinating men there I ever saw in my life.”
At the Melb. Easter Monday sham-fight.
Captain Buggins coming out from behind fence,
waving white handkerchief to enemy: “Will
Captain Jobson oblige with a few hundred rounds
of cartridge ? If not, we must retire.” Cartridges
sent, and, to the amusement of the crowd, the
firing was renewed.
N.S.W. Marine Board’s annual lighthouse
picnic cost last time .£450. So far as can %e
gathered, there were 8 unofficial and unnecessary
guests to 0 unnecessary or official. A special
steamer was engaged, and tilings were done in
style —as they always are. So the province’s
money is muddled away. Three men—an engineer,
a sailor, and an architect—could perform the in-
spection in one of the Board’s own boats at a cost
of ,£2O in addition to their regular salaries as civil
servants. But as the country has to bleed, why
shouldn’t the Marine Board bleed it as well as
others?
An enterprising Newcastle man wanted to
reach Westralia, but hadn’t money enough to
carry him through. He stowed away on a Sydney-
trading collier, and was subsequently gaoled for
three weeks in Darlinghurst. He adopted similar
methods to get right round, and reached Perth
after a. three months’ journey, mainly spent in
working out a fortnight in Melb. gaol and a
month’s durance in the Holy City. Finally he
s rved six weeks in Perth, as an example. Being
s'ill idle, and likely to remain so, the enterprising
Cornstalk occasionally deplores his numerous
transhipments.
Raymond Blathwayt, the English press-
man who has come here to lecture, may be a good
interviewer, but as an interviewee—well, it is
plain he doesn’t yet know his Australia. From
what he poured into the note-book of a Sydney
D.T. man, the other day, Mr. R. B. apparently
imagines that this beastly rubbish-dump is pre-
pared to worship even the mere names of the
British alleged aristocracy. “Lord Beresford is
a personal friend of mine and I often stay at his
place;” “ Some of my introductions are from
Lord Winohelsea ” —or words to that effect. Let
him say, or be reported as saying, anything like
that again, and Australia will earthquake and
chasm right across from Cape York to Cape Otway
in order that it may vomit freely enough to ex-
press its sentiments.

Dear Bulletin, — Be “P. M.’s” assertion
that the vegetable Chow more often than not
buys his goods before he sells them. If the
vegetable Chow’s Australian operations were con-
fined exclusively to the largest cities, “ P. M’s.”
statement would be partially correct, as in
Melbourne, for instance, Chinamen do to some
extent buy in the open market, although the same
market is partly supplied by Chinese. Unfor-
tunately, the Chow’s ramifications are not con-
fined to" the largest cities, but extend throughout the
length and breadth of Australia. In Victoria,
especially, he has taken such a hold upon almost
every country town and village, that his price is
“ the price,” all white rivalry being annihilated.
In country places, yellow men with their co-oper-
ative gardens hold an impregnable position. For
instance, the Chinese of Minjip, a Wimmera
town, supply customers within a radius of 30
miles, hardly a white person within that limit
being able to grow for sale any sort of vegetable
whatever. Before the Chinese advent two white
men were growing vegetables at Minjip, but did
not, and could not, compete with Bung Hi, either
in price or quality. Now, these Chows do not buy
their goods before selling, neither do the Chinamen
in other districts outside of Melbourne. Further,
“P. M.” says the Chinaman “is never cheap.”
I did not say he was, but that he had the ability to
sell cheaply or fix his prices to suit himself. Now,
at Minjip, Ballarat, and scores of other places in
Victoria, the co-operative garden system, which
makes each Chow more or less of a principal, is the
very means to the end of cheap production. Every
man working with a will for Ids own, if not for his
partners’, benefit, saves all middleman waste.
Then the men who grow the vegetables hawk and
sell them, being thus able to sell at “ absolutely
cost price.”—P.B.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Interprovincial Lawn Tennis Tournament
began at Sj dney Cricket Ground last Saturday and was
columned all through the week. Lawn-tennis is not a
game of strength or heroism ; it is not so dangerous as
football, nor so reckless as steeplechasing ; hut it needs
accuracy and quickness of eye, and the nimbleness and
long-windedness of a hare, A lawn-tennis player, too, is
all the more popular for good calves—and just here it is
fitting to remai k that Colquhoun might easily find a buyer
for a shapely pair among the London Gaiety dancers.
The tennis was well-patronised by society, and
many of the local ladies, who shake hands high up in the
air, hoisted their parasols so that the men standing behind
their chairs saw no tennis whatever. Twelve single-handed
matches were played ; Victoria won the first and the last;
N.S. VV. the intervening 10; and the day closed with 27
sets to N.S. \V., and 9 to Victoria. The surprise of the
day was the brilliancy shown by Dewhurst in beating
Green, the crack Victorian ; but undoubtedly Dewhurst,
at his best, is the pick of the present bunch of contestants.
The matches were of a sameness; the Victorians
frequently made the mistake of following a weak service
up to the net, and they lost twice as many points as they
won by repeatedly trying for the volley. The last match
of the day, between the old opponents Webb and Green,
warmed interest into enthusiasm. For Green had been
beaten by Dewhurst, and Webb had won his contest
against Waters; and yet in past matches Green had
invaiiably beaten Webb two sets out of three, and Webb
as invariably had won three sets out of five. And this
was a three-set contest.
The crowd stood three and four deep around
the ropes, and Judge Manning, now happily much
improved in health, presided. Webb played with
his accustomed coolness and adroitness, settling
himself to win the game by his skilful placing of the
ball, and Green responded by flying hither and thither
about the court, springing in and leaping out, and work-
ing himself into a fever-heat, ending in baths of per-
spiration which he frequently mopped up with a towel.
Webb won the first set, and Green the second, and both
men gave exhibitions at times which made even stiff
society matrons applaud. But in the third set Green
re-doubled his efforts and won the rubber rather easily by
six games to two.

Australian cyclists look forward with ardour to
the coming of the unbeaten flyer, the famous Zimmerman.
He will be here in three months or so, and then Megson,
the Sydney champion, must set his strong jaw. Megson
is now on an overland trip, vid the back country, from
Sydney to Brisbane. Bennett, who looks after Megson
upon the race-track, does not approve of his man’s trip—
says that delving at a heavy machine along roads and
carrying blney into the bargain, is training a racehorse
by putting him to hard graft in dray-shafts. A big con-
sideration is that Zimmerman has done his wonders upon
concrete and asphalt tracks, and he may, therefore, find
Megson upon a grass track an unusually tough customer.
It was not Beach, but the Parramatta River, that beat
Hanlan—so Hanlan always said.
* » * *
Many of the cricket powers are urging that the
next Australian team for England be composed of teeto-
tallers. “We have had enough of the heavy drinker and
small scorer; we want the small drinker and heavy,
scorer.”

The hungry Vic. footballers “ killed the goose.”
Last season they gave no passes out, and sold hogwash at
sixpence a glass, while pubs, opposite were vending it at
3d. per pint. Children with their parents were charged
full price. Yet the very grounds they play on belong to
the public.

Victorian football will seriously suffer this year
owing to the many other forms of” winter sport now
indulged in. Cross-country running is growing in popu-
larity; as instanced by the recent opening run at Malvern
(Vic.), in which 239 harriers appeared in full costume.
In addition to thfS.the Rugby game is making good head-
way down South, while lacrosse and baseball also have
their partisans.
» » * »
Rugby football is going to have a good time this
year in Melb. An admirer named Nash has presented
the Vic. Union with a 20-guinea cup for competition
during the season, while an offer has been received from
Sydney for a team to visit N.S. Wales next year, the
N.S. W. Union paying all expenses. Needless to say the
offer was accepted, and so the matches will take place in
August next. Besides all which visits are expected from
Maoriland and English teams.

Essendon’s 8 goals 17 behinds against Richmond
an Saturday eloquently demonstrates the loss of Thur-
good, last year’s champion goal-kicker.
• * * *
There is a glut in the market for football um-
pires. In Adelaide alone there are at least six Melb.
umpires seeking billets at 30s. per match—a fair remu-
neration for a Saturday afternoon’s work. When tie
Australian footballer Icfees his youth, is discarded by his
jlub, and misses his £2 per week expenses, he takes to
umpiring.
• * * *
When are the football associations playing the
Australian game going to legalise professionalism ! At
present every footballer is hypocritically called an
‘‘amateur,” whereas the majority are out-and-out
“pros.,” making a direct living from the game. Cricket
profits, although not nearly so large as football profits, go
in improvements to the plaving grounds, but the enor-
mous “ gates ” taken at football matches seem to be
poured into the bottomless sink of professionalism. Yet
the footballer must not be called anything but an “ ama-
teur.”
» ♦ * »
Sydney footballers are going to have a ground
of their own. As this move is the outcome of a difference
with the Cricket-ground authorities, and as the new site
will be on the old rifle-range, exactly adjacent to the
Cricket-ground itself, the latter’s management will
gnaw its nether lip when the football next door clashes
with cyclists’ and other meetings.

A Johannesburg correspondent tells The Bui,-
tiBTIN that “the fight between Burge and Murphy was
the toughest thing since the Heenan-Sayeis match. The
two Jims had been matched for a 35-round glove-fight,
and the day before the event it was said that they had
arranged matters very comfortably. Each accused the
other; dirty linen was washed ad nauseam-, and each
wanted to demolish the other. So one fine, sunny Sunday
morning as wicked and gory a fight took place as has been
seen in this or any other country. *No amphitheatre and
no gloves for me,’were Burge’s sentiments, and ‘Right
you are,’ quoth Murphy. Out. on the veldt, under a
blazing sun, they put in 2hrs. lOmin. working their way
through 35 rounds in a way that would have delighted
Jem Mace. Murphy very nearly went out in the second
round, when the old ’un fell on him with his elbow in Ins
stomach. After that Burge took his gruel with all the
oid-time indifference. Had they not made it a draw, I
believe it would have ended like the Kilkermy-cat episode
—there would have been nothing left of either. Murphy
is now off to England after Valentine’s scalp ; and plenty
of Rand money will be on him, for, rightly or wrongly, the
opinion is pretty general here that he has no equal at his
weight.”

Yankee papers tell how Griffo gave the mighty
" Jem " Corbett bis quietus with a right-footer on the
point of the jaw. Griffo having annoyed Corbett in a bar,
Corbett knocked the little ’un down with his open hand,
and then stooped over him, whereupon Griff, landed the
heel of bis boot on the jaw of Mr. Corbett, who fell
back and split his head open against an iron pillar. Griff,
and his party then made tracks.
And, by the way, Griffo is credited with having
the toughest crowd to be found in the States at his back-

a knock-out was recorded. O’Donnell is to meet Peter
Maher on May 15, and the Irishman is just about good
enough to prove conclusively what Steve is made of.

The inclusion of Dawson (Mercantile R.C.) in
the Vic. interprovincial eight practically amounts to the
Vic. Association throwing down the gauntlet to N.S.W.
A month nr two hack the Sydneyites announced that they
would insist on the strict interpretation of the amateur
rule, evidently having th< ir eye upon Dawson, who
was a “cash amateur” cyclist at the time. Now that
the selectors of the Vies, have refused to listen to the
Northerners’ protest and put Dawson in, everybody is
waiting to see the next move. At any rate, the N.S.
Welshmen are consistent, while the Vies, are acting in
absolute defiance of their own constitution. Both asso-
ciations, at the present, rule that a professional in one
sport is a professional in everv sport, yet the Mel-
bournians, though well aware that Dawson has pedalled
for cash prizes, pretend to accept the cyclists' gag—
“ cash amateur.”

Coursing flourishes in Maoriland. Every centre
has its club, and rich stakes are offered for competition.
In N.S.VV. the sport is almost entirely neglected. Among
the 69 dogs left in the Dunedin Challenge Stakes, to be
decided this month, are Vic. and N.S.VV. owned animals.

Boats seem to he as great a drug in the market

Miller’s good horse. The Indian, won his last
hurdle-race in Victoria on Saturday last. He has been
bought by Uphill, “ the Indian buyer,” who now justifies
his title. Uphill was not to take delivery till after Caul-
field, so that, despite his big weight (12st. 71b.), he was
well backed by his party, and won meritoriously. Cer-
tainly Mr. Sep. Miller made the most of his opportunities
with this horse, who is ab nit the most consistent prad
running. The much-talked-of Captain Webb started
favorite, but didn’t get even a place.

Mr. Palfrey’s mare, Rita, trotted the final heat
of the Champion Stakes mile, at Christchurch, M.L., in
2.30. It was hoped by lovers of the sport that Sydney
Agricultural Show’s trot would have given the game a
fillip locally, hut nothing has come of it. Pastime, one
of Sydney’s best, has now gone over to M.L., and is not
likely to come back.

The new watch-tower at Randwick must surely
be in a bad position, as the stewards mounted therein
were, the other day, unable to see what was patent to
pretty well every racing man on the course—that a certain
jockey had all his work cut out to stop his mount from
winning.

Eiridspord’s (third prize in the St. Alban’s art
union) dam, Sonsie Queen, is a Musket mare, got by that
great gun before the English breeders knew the value of
the blood. Eiridspord’s sire, Isonomy (sire of the cham-
pion Isinglass) was perhaps the bestmodelled thorough-
bred ever seen in England. It is no wonder Mr. Wilson’s
horse has been a success at the stud—giving us Eirids-
ford, Challenger, Alveary and The Moor in so short a time.

The best of the seven M.L, racers now due in
Sydney from Auckland is, of course, St. Hippo, Maori-
land’s crack horse, albeit he»has not raced for a s ason or
two. His three-year-old career was remarkably brilliant,
but when taken to Melb. he was palpably off. A season
at the stud has done him no harm.

In the appointment of their new handicapper,
people discerned an inclination on the part of the A.J.C.
to countenance pony-racing. But there has yet been no
active sign of the expected change.

Judging by recent events, the cableman will soon
be giving us details of Carbine’s amours.

The St. Alban’s people, as The Bulletin hinted,
are scarcely wise in putting Trenton iu a “raffle” when
so big a price could undoubtedly be secured for him in
England. On the turf he was scarcely inferior to
Cirhine. Dan O’Brien, who brought both across-front
MaoriUnd, according to an interviewer, stated that
Trenton was, in his opinion, the better. Trenton has
proved a very successful sire, and the same can hardly be
said of Carbine, so far. The fact that the great Ormonde
begot Orme, and nothing more, is sure to influence
breeders.

and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known. _ ■ ,
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Inver.

Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, sucli as Gravel, Chronic Calarrh, morbid Irrita
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affeclions. The action of
Buchu on the~human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read wbat Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. 'The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting ii
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB-I find tin so Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges
tion. 1 therefore thus recommend them.

The Dairy Exports of N.S.W.
For imported butter, Great Britain pays annually
£13,000,000, of which Sweden and Denmark get
£7,000,000, and Denmark’s share gives her £8 10s.
a year per head of her population.
• * •
N.S.W. is hardly felt in the competition, her
portion of the total last year being but £150,000.
Victoria sends five times as much farui produce to
London as N.S.W. does, yet she beg.m but nine
years ago, whilst the older province exported
frozen mutton in ’7B and frozen
butter in ’B4. South Australia, which
began the year before last, is fast
catching N.S.W. in the competi-
tion. Maoriland is far ahead ; and
Queensland, possessing, as she does,
three times as many cattle, is taking
the lead in frozen beef. N.S.W.
holds her own in mutton ; some
850,000 frozen sheep were exported
last year. Of these, over 500,000
were frozen by the N.S.W. Fresh
Food and Ice Co.
* » •
In addition to their great butter
trade, Denmark and Sweden send to
Great Britain annually pork and
bacon to the value of £2,300,000.
These two countries act in alliance in
bidding for the spoils of the British
market. Their system is scrupulous,
comprehensive, and progressive, con-
trolled and directed scientifically by
wise Governments. They hold dairy
shows, at which either country may
compete, every fortnight throughout
the year, and at the end of the year
the factory securing the highest total
of points is declared the winner;
the prizes amount to £1350. The
experts of the respective Agri-
cultural Departments are the judges
at these shows, and if anything radi-
cally wrong is at any time dis-
covered in a factory’s butter, a Govt,
expert is on the spot atonce to cope
with the evil. Besides this there are
efficiently trained agents stationed over
Great Britain to look after the trade there. And
thus N.S.W., and Australia generally, in sending
butter to the London market, have to compete
with countries whose long-established Government
control ensures the excellence of their exports, and
whose agents are familiar with every phase of the
British market, and every peculiarity of the
British palate. All these portentous facta were
carefully studied and noted by Mr. Pateson, the
active and far-seeing manager of the N.S.W.
Fresh Food and Ice Co., during his recent eight
months’ business tour through Europe.
• * •
“And,” says Mr. Pateson, “N.S.W. has abso-
lutely no system ; her farmers plod on in ignor-
ance of the scientific methods of the day, and her
uon-Legislative Assembly makes no effort to
instruct or help them on this subject of vital
importance. The other provinces will
soon leave her last in the race. There
is a fairly-managed Governmental system
in Victoria, and through that aid the
farmers there are more energetic- more
up to date than those of N.S.W. It is
no use blinking that fact,” Mr. Pateson
is as patriotic as he is vigorous, and he
insists that if a Governmental plan were
instituted on the efficient principle of
the Danes and Swedes the local butter
would soon rival that of those older and
successful countries. “ But we must have
experts, not " inspectors ; ” intellects, not
politicians’ friends and relatives.”
* * *
The Fresh Food and Ice Co., which
was founded by the patriotic T. S. Mort,
will not keep abreast of the times ; it
will lead the way. A new creamery,
on the latest principles, is to be erected
at Grafton at a cost of .£5OOO, and
thence the butter will be exported to
London. At this new creamery, for the
first time in N.S.W., the cream will be
raised in temperature to 180, and then
cooled down to 40 for the purpose of
destroying all possible noxious germs.
* * *
“In dairy produce,” says Mr. Pate-
son, “ the English people will have every-
thing mild and first-class in quality.
They want butter exceptionally good,
with a minimum of salt. Even in the mining
districts they are strict about quality, although
they do not object to a little more salt. A good
deal of execrable stuff has been sent from here to
England, and the senders have lost money upon it
as they deserved to do. When I went to London
I took with me samples of all Australian produce,
and I found that our mild butter of the best
quality, with but one per cent, of salt, was in first-
class condition after being kept ten weeks.
* * *
“And the English people want cheese so mild
that they can eat it by the yard. They will posi-
i\vely not buy strong cheese, and that fact cannot
tie too deeply impressed upon the Australian pro-
ducer. The Bodalla Cheese and Bacon Co. is
making cheese on the Canadian Cheddar principle,
which yields the mildest cheese known, and this
cheese will become very popular on the English
market. This Company is taking a strong lead.
The late T. S, Mort spent =£30,000 upon it before
one cheese was made, and close upon .£200,000 has
been spent upon the estate. But good dividends
are in store.
# * *
“The Fresh Food and Ice Co. is sending
beef mutton, hares, rabbits, butter, cheese, and
honey to England, and it will take the lead now
by sending pork, veal, and poultry. It wi 1 not
pay us to send game. Poultry, like everything
else for the English market, must be the very best:
good young roosters, fattened up to perfection by
artificial means. After being killed, they must
he plucked only, not drawn, before being placed
in the refrigerating chambers ; this method keepr-
the flesh moister.
“When the late T. S. Mort began sending
frozen mutton to England, freights were from 2d.
to 2£d. per lb. ; now they are from three-farthings
to fifteen-sixteenths of a penny. Ido not think
that much success awaits the venture in chilled
meat, but I feel confident that Nelson’s defrosting
process will revolutionise the trade in frozen meat.
After frozen carcases have been thawed hy this
process it is impossible to tell that they have ever
been in the freezing chamber.

“There should be no prejudices against ‘colo-
nial ’ products in England : our beef is among the

sent day, and the N.S.W. people and Government
will have to wake up thoroughly and work un-
ceasingly to develop this great indi s ry. And
then a splendid success will reward us,”
The St. Albans Estate, situated within
about three miles of Geelong (Vic.), is by far the
most charming country 7 property in the Southern
province, and is more suggestive of the wealth,
taste, and leisure which enable the privileged
classes of Great Britain to make even the desert
smile and the wilderness blossom like the rose,
than of anything characteristically Australian. A
couple of illustrations showing the house and a
view taken in the garden appear in this issue.
The house, a single-storied brick building, concedes
everything to comfort, and little or nothing to
vanity. But while it is absolutely unpretentious
it forms a very fitting centre to the spacious and
admirably arranged grounds which surround it, and
is, in fine, a gentleman’s residence perfect in all its

appointments, and adequate in every respect to
the requirements of modern life. During the
hospitable regime of the present owner (Mr.
W. R. Wilson), St. Alban’s has fre piently
entertained large parties of guests, and the
housekeeper is now and again disconcerted by the
sudden arrival of 20 or 30 of Mr. Wilson s
friends for a few days’ stay. The estate itself
consists of 842 acres, divided into 30 paddocks,
separated by growing hedge fences. The land is
extremely fertile and sound, nearly all the pad-
docks being laid down in English grasses. The
Barwon River (2 chains wide and 20 feet deep)
intersects the property, thus ensuring a never-fail-
ing supply of fresh water, for irrigation and domestic
purposes. The system for the former is perfect,
the drains being most extensive ; and the steam
pumping plant has a capacity of 120,000 gallons
per hour. The rainfall is, however, so good, that
it is rarely necessary to irrigate more than two or
three paddocks during a summer. The plantations
and hedges, of which several miles exist, add to the
usefulness and beauty of the estate in a marked de-
gree. As a breeding and racing establishment it is
Questionable if any more complete place exists in
Europe; certainty it has no rival in Australia.
Originally selected and laid out by Mr. James
Wilson, one of the keenest Australian judges,
money has continued to be freely emended onim-
proving and perfecting it by Mr. W. R. Wilson,
its present owner, so that it is now one of the sn
places of Victoria. The property as f ' vho '®’

tralians that everything will be conducted in

The shares are going off rapidly.
The April number of Cosmos is much the

by Ciias. Bright; on “An Australian School of
Literature,” by E. A. Badham ; on Horne and
Deniehy, by G. B. Barton ; and on Charles Brad-
laugh, by Ernest Besant-Scott, are particularly
interesting, but by no means exhaust the interest.
“ A Man of Method,” by “ Samuel Oliall White,”
is a slight but entertaining story ; and the
“poetry ”is beneath notice. One bard (Scottish,
of course) begins—
An upturned boat on the beach lay dry,
And the little waves tickled the shells thereby.
“ Tickled ! ” “ Thereby ! ” Eh, mon ! but yon’s

Mitchell’s “ Newspaper Press Directory ”
—the best publication of its kind with which The
Bulletin is acquainted—reaches, with 1805, b
50th year of issue. The jubilee is celebrated, so
far as Australasia is concerned, by interesting
historical articles on the press of each province,
well written and rarely inaccurate. The “Direc-
tory ” is up-to-date and reliable, and does credit
to its editor and his helpers.
Many ladies who favor that most becoming
fashion of tailor-made gowns have lost sight of the
King of Ladies’ Tailors in Australasia—Mr. B.
King, late of Coll ins-street, and, we are sure, will
be pleased to discover him again. We are able to
give the information. Wo. now find him with
Messrs. Hicks, Atkinson and Sons, the successors
of the old-established firm, Moubray, Rowan and
Hicks, who, under his guidance, have made a
special department for Ladies’ Tailoring—a branch
which it is not surprising to see daily increases in
favor. It is to Mr. King that ladies have to be
grateful for a new patent riding-skirt, which
minimises the danger of a fall.

A number of Chows were fined =£10 and costs
at Melb., the other day, for running ticket-lotteries. Tne
profits of the business will, however, stand a lot of such
hues. A clerk in one of the most religious Melb. houses
was engaged in the nefarious occupation of “ marking a
ticket ” in one of the branches of the lottery-bank, the
other day, when a policeman appeared in the doorway.
Police-court publicity meant certain dismissal, and there
was no opportunity for flight; so, great was the relief of
the when the Celestial welcomed the minion of
the law in a familiar and friendly manner with: ‘‘Well
you blank, dash, crimson, red-headed Ilishman, what you
want? ’ And the latter replied in a similar vein, winding
up with a demand for a ticket. Later that evening the
raid xvas made.

London papers to hand announce the death and
burial of W. H. Sprague’s buli-dawg, Don Pedro. The
obsequies were of an imposing character. Deceased went
to his last home in a polished oak coffin, covered with the
Union Jack and a mass of floral tributes, whilst one of ins
sons, dressed in black canine garments for the occasion
acted as chief mourner. The coffin’s brass plate bore the
inscription, “Don Pedro, an old English bull dog ; born
August, 1882 ; died February, 1895.’’ There is something
very touching about cockney reverence for bull-dogs,
which are popularly regarded as the representatives of
‘ true British pluck” among the animal creation. The
smaller and flabbier the cockney the greater his belief in
British pluck.

At Lake Macquarie, N.S.W., not long ago, the
crews of three fishing-boats were wuicning, with nets for
the incoming mullet-schools at the narrow channel con-
necting lake and ocean, and when the record school
came along the fishers spliced together all their nets
making a total length of about a mile. For three weeks
the three boats were carrying the fish to market. The
fish, during their captivity, were held in the nets and fed
—which could only he accomplished in a place like Lake
Macquarie, where the tide rises and falls just about 18in.

Dear Bulletin —In Victoria I’ll concede the
palm to no one as a fish-liar, but Tasmanian talent drives
me out of the big. Whilst fishing at St. George’s Bay
St. Helens, during the holidays, I had the rare luck to’
catch a genuine English mackerel (i.e., identical in every
respect with the mackerel caught in English waters) The
friends who were with me regarded it as a rara places
and it was much admired in the local pub. by everyone
except the local “know-all,” who assured us that it was a
very common fish in St. George’s Bay indeed, he
himself had, with a rod and line, only a week before com-
pletely filled this same boat with the same fish in’three
houis. The carrying capacity of that boat was seven and
a halj tons.— Moorite.

Melb. football clubs’final rehearsals on Saturday
week were mainly devoted to settling the claims of new'
talent. The chief match, Esiendon v. Combined Juniors,
showed that last year’s premiers have some remarkably
good men to replace losses, Norman Waugh, Jones, and a
darkie named Johnson being top-sawyers. In fact, it is
doubtful if Essendon will not he stronger than last year.
In any case, this year’s premiership going to Melb. F.C.
is by no means a foregone conclusion.

THIS Company is formed to acquire Fifteen auriferous sections, immediately adjacent to the cele-
brated Harris Reward Cold Mine, at Mount Jukes, West Tasmania, and to work or re-sell all
or any of the same. Ihe sections are known or numbered as follows on the accompanying plan of the
district: Nos. 7 (otherwise Sailor Jack), 9, 12, 14, 34. 36, 39, 44, and A, B, C, D, E, F and G. The
sections comprise an area of about 140 acres.
As will be seen from the plan, what is believed to be Harris’ Reward rich reef, has been found on
section No. 9. An auriferous reef has also been located on section B, whilst a third reef is proved on
section No. 7 (Sailor Jack).
The developments now taking place on Harris’ Reward Claim prove the existence of an enormous
body of highly payable quartz, the reef being from 8 to 12 feet wide, and in the opinion of the Manager
(Mr. Nugent) good for 6to 7oz. per ton. In his report of 16th April on the Harris claim, Mr. Nugent
states :‘ 1 have extended Harris’ trench 6 feet further South. There is a splendid show in it The
reef is 12 feet wide, and every stone a good specimen. I sunk a shaft 28 feet deep on the Western
wall, at the extreme Northern end. There is a grand reef in sight, very rich, and a 6-inch leader
extremely rich.
aurif * W llH ' l,BVec * t,iafc ever y Ol >e of the sections proposed to be acquired by the Company will prove
S . i ..portant are the developments on the Harris Reward Mine (which was only discovered and
taken up last N-w Year’s Day) considered by the Government of Tasmania that despite the depleted
condition of the treasury, the Government are constructing a road thereto at a cost of .£450—,£300 to
be paid by the Government of Tasmania, £5O by the Harris’ Reward Gold Mine, and .£lOO by this
proprietary. J
The intention of the proprietary is, as developments proceed on the Harris’ Reward, and on the
section! belonging to the proprietary, to re-sell to subsidiary Companies on favorable terms a portion
oral of the proprietary sections. It will easily be understood that a considerable profit may be
den ved from the re-sale of these sections.
There is no doubt that the rich alluvial gold, worked in the immediate neighbourhood of Mount
Juk es, was derived from the line of reef traversing these sections.
As an evidence of their belief in the mine, the Vendors are content to take a large portion of the
purchase consideration in contributing and other shares.
If no allotment, the purchase money will be returned in full; in the case of allotted shares, if the
allotment-money is not paid within eight days of the allotment, the allotment may be cancelled and
the application deposit forfeited to the Company,

RESTORED TO HEALTH
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. M. A. Cumming, of Yarraville,
Victoria, Australia, says:
“About a year ago, I had a severe attack
of Influenza, which left me very weak, with-
out energy, appetite, or interest in life. Ob-
taining little or no relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recommended to me,
I finally tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, and from
that time, I began to gain health and strength.
I continued the treatment until fully recov-
ered, and now have very great pleasure in
telling my friends of the merits of Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla, and the happy results of its use. I
consider it the best blood-purifler known.”

great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger's Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her tothe

strength."

THE LITTLE ABBEY OF CARENNAC.
(On the Dordogne).
jjere—in God’s house of the open dome—
Vigil is kept by the pilgrim breeze ;
Here, from its sun-illumined tome,
Labor intones its litanies.
For discipline, here is the chastening rain ;
For burden, the fruit of the bending tree ;
The thorn of the rose for a pleasant pain,
And palm for a costless victory.
Oh ! if my vow but bound to these,
. Twere long ere this laggard step grew slack.
O, that the wilful world would please
To leave me my flocks, my birds, and bees,
My ivied stall and my hours of ease,
And my little Abbey of Carennac !
Far from the city’s guarded gate,
Free from the crush of its silken crowds,
I see the sun in his purple state,
And,the changing face of the courtier-clouds.
My thoughts are mine when my task is sped ;
My head aches not, and my heart is full ;
And the laurels that cumber my careless tread
Are the only ones that I choose to pull.
Away from my friends I love them best;
Away from my books no lore I lack :
H-re—no longer a flying guest,
With wavering foot that finds no rest—
Truth comes home to this lonely breast
In the little Abbey of Oareimac.
Thus, half-hid from the smile of Spring
Under the bough of a blossomed tree,
My single wish is the grace to sing
The praise of a spot where a bard should be.
Sounding clear as the forest call—
Wakening man in the monarch’s breast,
Many-voiced as the waters fail—
Speaking to every soul’s unrest.
My song should seize with a minstrel sway
Yon green twin-isles and their busy bac,
The hamlet white and the convent grey,
And the lodge for the wanderer on his way,
And thus tn mv France in n.v lit.fle lay
Give my little Abbey of Carennac.
To journey again o'er the hard highway ;
To enter a garrulous, troublous train ;
Uncalled to come, and unbid obey,
To feign it pleasure, and feel it pain.
To float—a straw on an idle stream ;
To glitter—a mote by the sunbeam sought;
To walk—a shade in a waking dream ;
To strive for nothings where all is naught.
An iron tongue to summon away,
And a rope of sand to hold me back,
Are the call to go, and the will to stay—
Clamorous duty and still delay ;
0 gilded gloom ! O green and gay
Of my little Abbey of Carennac !
Fields that teem with the fruits of peace,
Let your reapers reap, and your binders bind,
1 cannot flee for a fond caprice
Yon stony spot to my hand assigned.
To me are numbered the seeds that grow ;
Not mine the loss of the perished grain,
If working I watch for the time to sow,
And waiting pray for the sun and rain.
My day to God and the King I lend ;
The wish of my heart will bring me back
A few last, lightsome hours to spend,
And to pass with my lifelong looked-for friend,
Through a quiet night and a perfect end,
From my little Abbey of Carennac.

HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE
Prince of Wales
On a Wet Day.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is raining heavily and hopelessly in a very
small township among the mountains some seventy
miles from Sydney, The landlord of the big,
empty hotel Jeans over the counter of the empty
bar, and looks out speechlessly at the muddy road
which leads both ways to nowhere.
Presently two bright young Australians enter
and demand whisky. The landlord apparently
knows them well, for he says, curtly : “ Got the
money ?”
They haven’t got the money, but one of them
opines that the landlord might trust a blanky
bloke.
The landlord responds, briefly : “ I’m off you.”
The pair take the rebuff in good part. They
remark, in a friendly manner, that the landlord is
“a blanky hard case, blanked if he isn’t.” Then
they wander to the door and look out at the thick
atmosphere, which is full of strange noises like
those a cow makes trying to get its foot out of the
mud, and at a forlorn bullock-team going past,
and at a wet hen scudding under bare poles for a
place of shelter.
After a while one of them says, in an abstracted
fashion; “Gor’ strike me blind,” and the other
one silently acquiesces.
By-and-bye, eight road-men tramp in heavily
and remark that it is a blanky sort of a day, and
call for whisky. The landlord regards them sus-
piciously, but fills the order. The spokesman puts
down some money and offers to owe him the other
sixpence.
The land lord e vid ently disapproves of this arrange-
ment, but the customers remind liim that five of
them have had the blanky horrors in his house
within the last month, also that they had all spent
all their blanky cheques there, and they state that
he might trust a crimson bloke, and one of them
offers to fight him or any other blanky hiatus for
the dashed sixpence, and at last peace is restored.
Then there is an interval of silence until the
man in the corner lifts up his voice in a monologue
and utters eight oaths and five indecent expres-
sions. He addresses himself to nobody in par-
ticular and nobody answers him. After he has
finished off with a specially bright and exhilarating
curse there is more silence.
Suddenly, at one end of the room, a great and
violent shindy arises out of nothing.
The man with the patched pants is holding forth
at a great rate to the man with the torn hat.
“I can fight the best blanky man in this room,”
he says, enthusiastically. “I can fight the best
blanky man in the town. I’ll fight the best
blanky man in Australia an’ knock him out in
three blanky rounds. I’ll fight you now for a
blanky quid.”
The man with the torn hat simply says : “ Yer
a blanky cow,” but the smallest man in the room
sails in with a yell; “ I’ll fight -you for a hundred
blanky quid an’ put the money down.”
Then there is chaos and pandemonium. One
after another drifts into the riot until eight men
have agreed to fight each other on the spot for an
aggregate of .£lOOO or so. In the course of the
discussion each man has called every other one a
blanky liar at least twelve times, also each one
has called the rest nearly every indecent expres-
sion he knows of. The yells and vociferations of
the company can be heard all over the township.
Meanwhile the landlord looks on in sleepy unoon-
ctrn, and the wet hen, who has evidently beard
it all before, steps in out of the rain.
When the parties have all agreed to fight imme-
diately for enormous amounts they sib down or
lean against the wall, and the subject drops.
Apparently any person who proposed to fight in
real earnest would be scouted as a lunatic. No
one hits another. No one offers to put up any one
of the vast sums that are to be fought for. No
one even seriously resents being called a liar and
various other things as well. The fiercest-looking
desperado in the crowd steps out to look at the
weather and comes back disgusted.
After a while one of the party asks another to
sing some thing or other. The general con-
sensus of opinion is that the person in question
can’t sing worth a cent. He settles the point
by lifting up his voice in a rough but pathetic
melody with the refrain : “ Do you ever think of
mother.” It is tolerably well sung, and the com-
pany stops swearing till it is finished. Then one
person, who seems almost affected, states that it
is a good song. He also adds, approvingly,
that the melodist is a blanky hog at singing.
Two more men drop in. One is very wet; the
other partially drunk and cross. The former
shouts for the crowd; the latter states that the
audience are all —— cows.
Someone asks the wet intruder if he has heard
from Dick.
A voice from the corner interposes the state-
ment that Dick is a cow.
Someone else remarks irrelevantly that Dick can
jump all right, and asks, in a large and general
fashion, that Providence may strike him pink.
Then the drunken intruder says that Dick can’t
jump over a blanky egg, and a shambling person
says that he can jump sft. lOin, standing, and the
man with the worst hat says he can jump six
blanky feet, and another person offers to jump the
best flaming man in New South Wales for fifty
flaming quid, and everybody talks at once, and
calls every other person a liar with embellish-
ments, and the old pandemonium starts all over
again.
And, in the midst of it, a peaoeful-looking man
who is sitting in the corner lifts up his voice on
his own account and altogether apart from the
question at issue, and says : “ !! 1
,” and much more to the same effect. The
most striking feature about this statement is that
there isn’t one publishable expression in three
sentences. Nobody takes any notice of him. By
this time a tall, slab-sided man is holding his belt
at a height of seven feet above the floor and offer-
ing to jump over it there and then for a hundred
blanky quid. Everybody agrees to jump imme-
diately for a hundred blanky quid and put the
money down. Then the subject drops. Nobody
puts down a single copper and nobody jumps.
A cracked bell rings, and a few who are ap-
parently more solvent than the rest go in to
dinner. They ask each other to pass various
things, and blaspheme cheerfully all round. The
landlord’s wife and a rather pretty girl who waits
at the table take it all as a matter of course. After
dinner one sneaks away into the kitchen and
makes a matrimonial proposal to the waiting-
maid. It transpires that he is aconstant admirer,
and proposes ineffectually at every visit. On wet
days he hangs about the hotel and proposes more
or less all day long. As I pass the kitchen-door
some scraps of his wooing are wafted out along
with the odour of hash and other things. He is
telling the girl that he will blanky well marry her
any blanky time she will have him. He also
expresses a wish that Providence may strike him
blue. As he is struck considerably blue already,
with four days’ stubble on his face, this seems
superfluous.
It still rains dismally. The landlord lounges
about and refuses to be negotiated with, and the
damp hen cruises round dejectedly.
All through the long, dank afternoon the men
sib around and lie. There is a great and dreadful
sameness about their lies. One of them once
owned a dashed horse that was faster than any
other blanky horse in the country. Some of
the others call him a liar with many choice varia-
tions, and the rest all owned another dashed horse
which was much faster still. Another of them
had licked the most formidable pugilist ever known
in Australia, and the rest had licked a much more
formidable one. A small, lank-haired man had
run 100 blanky yards in nine seconds, and it pre-
sently transpires that almost all the rest had done
the same blanky distance in eight seconds. They
had all ridden fabulous distances in the shortest
time on record, and had jumped quite unprece-
dented heights, and each one had utterly extin-
guished everybody he met in every possible line of
industry. They are all prepared to bet fifty
blanky quid that they did all these things, and a
hundred blanky quid that they will do them
again, on the spot, at that very instant if required.
Most of them call each other many different kinds
of liars, and almost all of them bet a hundred
blanky quid that they can do all these things better
and more effectually than any one else present.
Nothing happens.
About five o’clock the two young Australians
have a disagreement, and undertake to tear each
other’s liver out for twopence. Nobody is
injured, however.
The lying, and the disagreement between the
two young Australians, and much plug tobacco,
fill in time somehow till tea. Then the bell rings
again, and the same crowd go in and blaspheme in
the presence of the pretty waiting-maid as before.
Also, the same individual drifts into the kitchen
afterwards, and doubtless renews his overtures in
the same form of language as heretofore.
Then they fill in the long, wet evening with
more plug tobacco, and tell all the old lies over
again without variations, and get up the same old
rows, and agree in the same old language to fight
each other for a hundred quid, and to run
each other for a hundred quid, and to jump
each other for a hundred quid, and to do
all manner of things for the same large and pro-
fane sum of money. Yet nobody fights, or jumps,
or runs, or does anything worth mentioning.
At nine o’clock I go to bed, but the voices of
the company rise up from below and keep me
awake, and the same old horse-lie comes up again
and again, and so do all the other lies and curses,
and until eleven o’clock or later a dissonant voice
is heard every few minutes agreeing to fight some-
body else for a hundred blanky quid. Then there
is silence, and more rain, and a holy calm.
Next morning it is still raining, and the same
crowd, or another just like it, is there again in
the middle of the same old performance, so I
decide to go on my way. And as I depart I hear
the voice of somebody who is telling his weary
horse-lie over again for the fiftieth time, and
somebody else who is relating how he licked a
champion pugilist in three rounds, and another
man who has jumped sft. 10in., or more, stand-
ing, and they are all backing themselves to do it
again on the spot for more blanky quid than any-
body can remember.
If I ever meet any of these men again in this
world I will know them by that dismal horse-lie
they are always telling. And if I ever meet them
in the next world I will know them, for I will
hear a discordant voice offering to jump'Gabriel
the Archangel for a hundred blanky quid."
TITUS SALT.
Face-massage—not the good old style of
treatment to be obtained for the asking in Mick
Nathan’s saloon—is becoming popular in Mel-
bourne amongst the few who can afford to pay for
it. The art is, however, as yet in its infancy.
There is a fortune waiting for the man who dis-
covers how to restore red noses to their original
color.
Panton, P.M. (Melb.), complains bitterly
that prisoners are too well-fed in the local gaol,
and offenders often let him see when he is sen-
tencing them to three months that they take it as
a kindness. The crying need of the city, it seems,
is a damp, cold, slimy prison for winter male-
factors, with long waits between meals, and un-
stinted lumbago and cold in the head for all
boarders. The magistrate, full of dignity, who
thinks to strike terror to the heart of a vagrant
with an eight-weeks’ sentence, and is pathetically
requested to “make it three months, couldn’t
you, please, guv’ner?” feels that he has outlived
his usefulness and is only an empty show.
It is said, on apparently good authority,
that one of the Syme clan, is chewing over plans
for t'u* establishment of a second evening paper in
Melbourne. There is a feeling in press circles that
a rival to the Herald is inevitable shortly.
Meanwhile, the only evening paper in the
Southern capital is about to shift its quarters.
It is leaving Collins-street, and taking up its abode
at the old De Graves bond building in Flinders-
street.

At Bathurst (N.S.W.), the other day, the
“ first Convention of local preachers in connection
with the Wesleyan Church ” was presided over
by Mr. J. 0. White, who has resided in the dis-
trict for over 50 years. Mr. White has a unique
record. He was one of the earliest settlers in
South Australia in the time of Hindmarsh and
Light, and built the first Wesleyan Church at the
Port with his own hands. The building still
stands but is now used as a printing-office. Mr.
White was one of the pioneers of the press over
the Blue Mountains, having for many years owned
the Bathurst Free Press newspaper, which he
bought from the founder, Mr. Farrer.

By writing as they best think fib
Of bushmen on the wallaby
That stab and shoot and drink and die
And show true Anglo-Saxon grit.

Where print and picture doubly lie, .
The libel never brings a writ
In London.

A like atrocity, to wit—

Oh, why are bonfires never lib

Our Pipes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The moon rose away out on the edge of a smoky
plain, seen through a sort of tunnel or arch in the
fringe of mulga behind which we were camped—
Jack Mitchell and I. The “timber ” proper was
just behind us, very thick and very dark. The
moon looked like a big new copper-boiler set on
edge on the horizon of the plain, with the top
turned towards us and a lot of old rags and straw
burning inside.
We had tramped 25 miles on a dry stretch on a
hot day—swagmen know what- that means. We
reached the water about two hours “after dark ”
—swagmen know what that means. We didn’t
sit down at once and rest —we hadn’t rested for
the last ten miles. We knew that if we sat down
we wouldn't Van t to get up again in a hurry—
that, if we did, our leg-sinews, especially those of
our calves, would “draw” like red-hot wires.
You see, we hadn’t been long on the track this
time—it was only our third day out. Swagmen
will understand.
We got the billy boiled first, and some leaves
laid down for our beds and the swags rolled out.
We thanked the Lord that we had some cooked
meat and a few “johnny-cakes” left—for we
didn’t feel equal to cooking. We put the billy of
tea and our tucker-bags between the heads of our
beds, and the pipes and tobacco in the crown of
an old hat, where we could reach them without
having to get up. Then we lay down on our
stomachs'and had a feed. We didn’t eat much—
we were too tired for that—but we drank a lot of
tea. We gave our calves time to tone down a bit;
then we lit up and began to answer each other.
It got to be pretty comfortable, so long as we kept
those unfortunate legs of ours straight, and didn’t
move round much.
We cursed society because we weren’t rich men,
and then we felt better and conversation drifted
lazily round various subjects and ended in that of
smoking.
“ How I came to start smoking?”said Mitchell.
“Let’s see.” (Mitchell reflected.) “ I started
smoking first when I was about 14 or 15. I smoked
some sort of weed—l forget the name of it—but it
wasn’t tobacco ; and then I smoked cigarettes,
not the ones we get now, for those cost a penny
each. Then I reckoned that, if I could smoke
them, I could smoke a pipe.”
Mitchell reflected.
“ We lived in Sydney then —Surry Hills. Those
were different times—the place was nearly all
sand. The old folks were alive then, and we were
all at home, ’cepting Tom.”
Mitchell reflected.
“ Ah, well! . . . Well, one evening I was
playing marbles out in front of our house when a
chap we knew gave me his pipe to mind while he
went into a church-meeting. The little church
was opposite—a 1 chapel ’ they called it.”
Mitchell reflected.
“The pipe was alight. It was a clay pipe and
nigger-head tobacco. Mother was at work out in
the kitchen at the back, washing up the tea-things,
and, when I went in, she said : ‘ You’ve been
smoking!’
“Well, I couldn’t deny it —I was too sick to do
so, or care much, anyway.
“ ‘ Give me that pipe ! ’ she said.
“I said I hadn’t got it.
“ 1 Give—me — that — pipe ! ’ she said,
“ I said I hadn’t got it.
“ ‘ Where is it ? ’ ” she said.
“Jim Brown’s got it,” I said, “ it’s his.”
“ ‘ Then I’ll give it to Jim Brown,’she said, and
she did ; though it wasn’t Jim’s fault, for he only
gave it to me to mind. I didn’t smoke the pipe
so much because I wanted to smoke a pipe so bad
just then, but more because I had such a great
admiration for Jim.”
Mitchell reflected, and took a look at the moon.
It had risen clear and had got small and cold and
pure-looking, and had floated away back out
amongst the stars.
“I felt better towards morning, but it didn’t
cure me—being sick and nearly dead all night, I
mean. I got a clay pipe and tobacco, and the old
lady found it and put it in the stove. Then I got
another pipe and tobacco, and she ‘laid for it,’
and found it out at last; but she didn’t put
the tobacco in the stove this time—she’d got
experience. I don’t know what she did
with it. I tried to find it, but couldn’t. I fancy
the old man got hold of it, for I saw him with a
plug that looked very much like mine.”
Mitchell reflected.
“ But I wouldn’t be done. I got a cherry pipe.
I thought it wouldn’t be so easy to break if she
found it. I used to plant the bowl in one place
and the stem in another because I reckoned that
if she found one she mightn’t find the other. It
don’t look much of an idea now, but it seemed
like an inspiration then. Kids get rum ideas.”
Mitchell reflected.
“ Well, one day I was having a smoke out at the
back, when I heard her coming, and I pulled out
the stem in a hurry and put the bowl behind the
water-butt and the stem under the house. Mother
was coming round for a dipper of water. I got
Out of her way quick, for I hadn’t time to look
innocent; but the bowl of the pipe was hot and she
got a whiff of it. She went sniffing round, first
on one side of the cask and then on the other,
until she got on the scent and followed it up and
found the bowl. Then I had only the stem left.
She looked for that, but she couldn’t scent it. But
I couldn’t get much comfort out of that. Have
you got the matches?
“ Then I gave it best for a time and smoked
cigars. They were the safest and most satisfac-
tory under the circumstances, but they cost me
two shillings a week, and I couldn’t stand it, so I
started a pipe again and then mother gave in at
last. God bless her, and God forgive me, and us
all—we deserve it. She’s been at rest these 17
long years.”
Mitchell reflected.
“ And what did your old man do when he found
out that you were smoking? ” I asked Mitchell.
“The old man ? ”
Mitchell reflected.
“ Well, he seemed to brighten up at first. You
see, he was a sort of pensioned-off by mother and
she kept him pretty well inside his income. . . .
Well, he seemed to sort of brighten up—liven up
when he found out that I was smoking.”
“Did he? So did my old man, and he livened
me up, too. But what did your old man do—what
did he say ?”
“ Well,” said Mitchell, very slowly, “ about the
first thing he did was to ask me for a fill.”
Mitchell reflected.
“ Ah ! many a solemn, thoughtful old smoke wo
had together on the quiet—the old man and me.”
Mitchell reflected.
“Is your old man dead, Mitchell?” I asked,
softly.
“Long ago—these twelve years,” said Mitchell.
HENRY LAWSON.
The Duchess of Albany is 34. A London
weekly observes : “ Her Royal Highness looks
very fit and well, and it is a pity, if it is true as
alleged, that the Queen will not yet allow the
Duchess to marry again.” A fit-and-well widow
prohibited from matrimony is indeed a subject for
compassion.
At East Brighton (Vic.), a little while ago,
a gardener found a black snake and out it in two
with his scythe. The top half escaped, but the
tail end remained and was killed. Later on, the
family cat found the upper end and brought it on
the verandah, and a few hours afterwards the
half-snake bit the gardener’s little daughter and
killed her.
Charles Gavan Daffy’s autobiography is on
the point of issue in London. In his treatment of
his Mel bourne experiences O’Shanassy must surely
loom up. When this very big man joined in the
effusive welcome to Duffy, which included the
presentation to him of a house and land at Haw-
thorn, the Melb. suburb, total cost, .£2OOO, all
raised by subscription amid the “rebels to the
backbone and spinal marrow,” ’cute critics saw
the rift, because two such Hibernian lions could
not both roar along one shore. Sure enough, they
had a fine old row, because Duffy thought the
great O’Shan, conspired, as Premier, with Attor-
ney-General Dick Ireland, to make the Duffy Land
Act abortive.
Bernard Shaw, Tas. Commissioner of
Police, is also acting P.M. for Hobart, and, in the
former capacity, investigates a case one day which
he has to hear in the latter capacity the next!
When he first mounted the Bench, he departed
considerably from the policy of his predecessor
(who hung tenaciously to the practices of the old
days—fining a first-offending drunk ss, with the
option of seven days, and other offences pro rata),
by letting the aforesaid first-offenders off with the
option of 24 hours’ gaol, and exhibiting similar
leniency all round. A man lias now got a much
better chance against the policeman than in the
days of the late P.M. Shaw has also dispensed with
the old laborious process of taking evidence in the
numerous trivial cases which crop up in police-
courts all over the world.
Rev. J. D. Langley, appointed to be
Archdeacon of Cumberland (N.S.W.), was, like
temperance-advocate Boyce and several other
Anglican clerical lights, a bank-clerk and manager
in early life, alternating the computing of interest
with the interpreting of texts in Newcastle
(N.S.W.) for many years. His last church, St.
Phillip’s, Sydney, was, in its first stage of exist-
ence, burnt down by convicts who hated to be
dragooned to prayers there every Sunday, and it
is worth noting in illustration of the logic of that
far-off period that the Governor, feeling satisfied
that the incendiary convicts desired a lazy Sun-
day, got even with them by ordering all the work-
ing gangs to be occupied on succeeding Sundays
in the building of a new church. Pastor Langley,
while at St. Phillip’s, fiddled at philanthropy,
and was a species of civilised Rev. Phillip Moses.
The N.S.W. Civil Service Inquiry Com-
mission has been posting complaints about the
enormities committed under claims for “ex-
penses.” ’T was ever thus inmost grades of life.
The entity travelling for himself and the entity
travelling for a firm are two distinct and separate
creatures. In the “good old” ante-telephonic
and ante-country-correspondentdays of journalism
in Melbourne, the “ex’s” often overtopped the
salary. David Syme, of the Age, was fairly
liberal, as things went, but once ho got a
“ scorcher ” from a “ rantin’, roarin’ ” reporter. It
was Gov. Bowen’s last public function in Victoria
—the opening of the Stawell-Horsham railway, at
Horsham—a three-days’ absence from Melbourne,

days, the more direct Ballarat-Melbourne line
not having been then constructed. A special
carriage and refreshments were provided for the
press, so that transit ex.’s were actually nil. The
little township of Horsham, when reached, was
so crowded that a bed couldn’t be had for love or
money. So that (given the banquet), beyond break-
fast next morning, and a late bowl of bread and
milk at Craig’s Hotel, Ballarat, on the return
journey (that was Peter Lalor’s suggestion), and a
tip to Craig’s night-waiter, the expenses were still
nought. But the press boys played Nap., and the
Age man lost <£B or so. Quo’ Pugh (now dead,
poor fellow), of the Argus, drily—“ Stick it on tc
your ex.’s.” “I can’t ; there are so few ex.’s this
trip.” “Ah! but it’s a bad precedent on your paper
not to have ex.’s ; or they’ll expect the next man
on a really costly journey to do it cheap.” Pugh,
of course, was only “guying,” but the thought
stuck. The Age man did put it in his ex.’s,
lumped up baldly as—“ Three days, Stawell to
Horsham, £9.” That bill stuck so long on
David Syme’s file that at last the bold author of
it bearded the boss and asked after its welfare.
“Aw don’t onnerstan’ it,” said Syme. “Simple
enough —expensive trip—three days away.” “Yes,
but ye had free railway.” “Of course, bub the
night at Horsham—township crowded—exorbitant
charges—and, of course, I had to represent the Age
worthily.” “ Weel, that may be; but gie me
items.” “ Oh, it’s items you want. Certainly !”
The reporter spoke gaily, but his heart was
beneath his diaphragm as he went to concoct
trie items. Presently he returned with a formid-
able list. “ I find, Mr. Syme, I’ve been cheating
myself. I lumped it at'£9, but I find, by the
items, that it’s <£9 Bs. 4d.” And he handed over
the account. He had overshot the mark in his
imaginative itemisation, but was too exhausted
with excitement to go through the trouble a second
time. Syme commenced reading half-aloud -
“Special cab, 6 a.m., from Emerald Hill to
Spencer-street station, 7s. 6d.; Age, Argus (3d.),
Daily Telegraph, 6d.; cup of coffee and a bun,
Is.; book to read on journey, 2s. fid.; flask of
brandy, 3s. fid.; mutton chop and a bottle of
porter at Geelong, 2s. fid.; bottle of porter for
friend, Is. fid. ” “There, there,” bursting out
laughing and appending the magic initials “D. 5.,”
which made the bill cash downstairs, “I’m satis-
fied !” So was the rep.

"THE BULLETIN."
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly-Australia's Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Js the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tinctive Australian National Policy,
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System - one House to
H be elected by constituencies'as at present;
tiie other to be chosen by the whole

A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility. ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless newspaper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushrnah of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
po[)ular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent Bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than an
other paper, because its vast mass of original an
specially written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.
