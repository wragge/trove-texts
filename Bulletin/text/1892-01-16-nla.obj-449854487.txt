ful information for every sufferer from the following com-
plaints, viz Loss of Energy and Will Power, NERVOUS

enced by Nervous Sufferers.
This Pamphlet is sent Free on Application,
and all in any way suffering from the above would derive
benefit from the perusal of this work.
If the patient’s case is of long standing, and, therefore
in need of treatment, ho should lose no time in writing
me a letter detailing in full his symptoms, on receipt of
which I will at once reply, explaining the nature of his
complaint, and if I can effect a cure, the time it will take,
and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the
treatment of Nervous Diseases has made me thoroughly
conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to
Guarantee a Permanent d Complete Cure in every caee I undertake.
I invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some time I was House Surgeon to the Great
Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of investigating the causes of Nervous Diseases, and
became perfectly acquainted with the most approved scientific and successful methods of affecting their cure.
ALL CONSULTATIONS, either by letter or in person, FREE. Hours of Consultation—From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
daily; Saturdays, 10 to 12 a.m. ; and from 7to 9 p.m. on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Address all letters—

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hi i
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. 11 is practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
•j) r Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25 000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to

DR. KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OF THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES, MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER.
ARB UNAWARE OP HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING, HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OF THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OF ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OP AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS. AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE PROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE dTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.
SEE HIS PALE AND SALLOW FACE, UPON WHICH
DISEASE HAS LEFT ITS MARKS.
AMONG WHICH ARE
ACNE (FLESH WORMS), PIMPLES (ESPECIALLY ON THE FOREHEAD),
DARK CIRCLES ROUND THE EYES, SLUGGISH PUPILS, AND EYES
WITHOUT LUSTRE, HE HAS A HAGGARD, TROUBLED LOOK, HIS
MANNER IS ECCENTRIC, LISTLESS, SHY AND EASILY CONFUSED,
HIS MOVEMENTS ARE SHUFFLING AND UNCERTAIN, AND
BETRAY A MIND ILL AT EASE, HIS MENTAL OPERATIONS ARE
ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT
ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO
REVERIE AND DESPONDENCY.
IF YOU‘ARE DOUBTFUL AS TO WHETHER YOU REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE,
YOU SHOULD WRITE TO THE DOCTOR WITHOUT DELAY.

“There was an ocean pilot, and his eldest son was blind,
And deaf and dumb from childhood, likewise vacant in
his mind ;
But of course he was a pilot when his daddy’s course was
run,
And navigated vessels as his father’s eldest son.
There was a learnfcd justice who sent criminals to gaol.
He’d an eldest son—a forger who’d absconded from his
bail ;
But when the judge went upwards through'a tin-tack in
a bun
His vacant place was taken by his outlawed eldest son.”
In a current issue of The Forum, Henry
Labouchere, himself commonly regarded as
a conspicuous Republican, writes what he
evidently considers to be the funeral oration
of British republicanism, and plants the
flowers of his rhetoric over its grave.
According to his theory, either the repub-
lican party is dead in England or else there
never was any such party at all. There is
no enthusiasm, he asserts, fcr the cause of
royalty, but there is no enthusiasm for the
other cause either, and amid this general
want of enthusiasm the British monarchy is
likely to last for many years to come. The
British royal family, in his view, will become
more and more a family of automata ; the
reverence that is paid them will keep on
fading by imperceptible degrees ; and the
monarchy, having descended in three
centuries from absolute authority to
comparative impotence, may spend three
centuries more in the slow descent from
comparative impotence to utter nothingness,
and yet survive the process. And then,
the British monarchy having become merely
a name and a salary, without the smallest ves-
tige of influence or usefulness, Labouchere
evidently imagines that it. may still go on
living. All the pomp and flunkeydom will
be gone ; the king with the sceptre will be
exchanged for a king with a cotton umbrella ;
the crown of gold and gems will degenerate
into pasteboard ; but still an unconsidered
shadow may wander round and be tolerated,
like a ghost in the daylight, simply because
it is the son of the shadow that went before
it.

It is a solemn picture, but still it is pos-
sible —in England. For the length and
breadth and thickness of British Conservatism
is incalculable. There is a weird grotesque-
ness in the situation, and in any country
save Britain the monarchy, as it now stands,
would die of public laughter, but the
Englishman never sees the humorous aspect
of things. Year after year the nation has
been at work stripping from the Crown
every vestige of real authority. It has
declared, by its acts, that the present royal
family, like the ones which went before it,
is too vicious and stupid to do the work for
which it was supposed to be created—that it
is tpo incapable for almost any purpose under
the sun —and in almost every constitutional
method that it can think of it has chained
up the dynasty as a thing that is unfit to
be at large. Yet it keeps on paying the
miserable object a huge sum per annum, and
gains no possible benefit from it, and seems
quite content with the arrangement. The
whole situation is very much akin to that of
the man who keeps a big snake in his cellar,
and is almost ruined through feeding the
animal, and is compelled to spend much of
his time watching it lest it should break
loose, and who yet declines to part with it
because it is an old-established and constitu-
tional snake, and the descendant of other
snakes that occupied the cellar of his fore-
fathers. It is a supremely English mode of
procedure, but the country which tolerates
the House of Lords and its entourage, and
the Lord Mayor of London and his en-
tourage, and a thousand other costly and
bumptious excrescences when they have
long since lost the power of self-defence,
and which pays them when they have no
longer the power to enforce payment, is
capable of anything.

England is almost the only country in the
two hemispheres which retains a hereditary
monarchy from choice. France, Switzerland
and the American republics all gave their
potentates notice to quit as soon as they
found themselves strong enough to do so, on
the ground that monarchy was an unmixed
evil, and that the system whereby a country,
for the sake of one strong and capable ruler,
is compelled to endure twenty generations of
his imbecile descendants, is unspeakable
folly. The kingdoms of Asia and Central
Europe still endure their hereditary
sovereigns because they have, so far, found
themselves unable to get rid of them. Eng-
land alone has practically abolished the
monarchy, and still pays a salary to its
ghost. The power and dignity of the Crown
is extinguished. The royal family exists to
play baccarat, and lay foundation-stones, and
make dreary speeches at dreary institutes, to
distribute flannel petticoats at long intervals
to hypothetical old women, and write
“ Leaves from a Journal in the Highlands,”
to yawn vacuously over addresses from
bumpkin corporations, and to be fat and
stupid and unutterably weary. A British
king of the nineteenth century is not a man,
nor is he exactly a woman, nor any other
thing that is definable. He is only paid to
be harmless. He has no authority to do
anything, for if he had such authority the
chances are that he would do something bad.
The only thing on earth that resembles him
is the wooden god in a gorgeous Asiatic
temple—the impotent article which the
Hindoo grovels to from force of habit—
which never does any good and seldom does
much harm—and which, when it is kicked
by its worshippers, can’t kick back. He is
out on bail for the evil things that were done
by his ancestors, and for those which he
would do himself if he got the opportunity,
and in a general way he resembles a closely-
watched and partially-trusted lunatic. In
Rome the consular title was preserved long
after the had abolished the consular
authority, and one of the wildest of the
emperors made his horse a consul by way of
a practical commentary on the situation. If
there was any vestige of humour in the
British nation it would make a horse its
king for exactly the same reason.
* * #
The Englishman, more than any other
individual on earth, reverences anything
that is old, merely by reason of its age. The
principle of hereditary monarchy is old—
like' mud and leprosy and premeditated
homicide and, therefore, its hideous
grotesqueness never occurs to his intelli-
gence. Most dynasties begin with one
strong and vigorous sovereign, and after him
come, as a rule, a long succession of dreary
imbeciles—for no wise sovereign ever yet
left a wise successor, and in every walk of
life the philosopher is sandwiched in between
two or more fools—and it seems perfectly
reasonable in Ids eyes that the nation should
put up with these imbeciles simply because
they are the descendants of their father. If
the surgeon s son should insist on sawing off
legs and arms merely because he was his
father's offspring, or the artillerist’s son
should insist on tiring off guns at random as
heir to his father’s bombarding connection,
he would doubtless perceive something
absurd about the situation only because it
was new, but the other situation is hallowed
by old age and has become respectable in
c nsequeuce. Yet in a certain clumsy and
patchy sense he has realised that there is a
failure somewhere. The original monarch
was created to bo, in some degree, a bulwark
to the nation in a barbaric and dangerous
age. He was to be its leader in war and
its brains in political life, and he was
paid accordingly. His descendants, prov-
ing unequal to the work, arc now paid
to leave it alone the idea of abolish-
ing them never occurs to the British
mind. The British nobility, in the same
remote period, was the strength of the
country in war and its legislative,, force in
time of peace ; its descendants are
race of fat and unwarlike drivellers in the
House of Lords, and the utmost efforts of
the nation are mow spent to induce them to
leave it alone also. If the House of Commons
had been a hereditary governing body in
earlier days, it would likewise have to be
paid not to govern, but it happened by acci-
dent that out of three governing bodies only
two were authorised to hand down their
ower to any drunkard or imbecile who
night come after them, and therefore only
two-thirds of the British Government has
become utterly useless. The Briton is proud
of this fact; he whoops with unreasoning
glee because one-third of his Government
isn’t dead, and calls that fact the British
Constitution, and sings “God Save the
Queen ” over it with unnecessary vehemence.
And he is so well satisfied with these results
that Labouchere regards the prospects of
the Republic as very far off and indefinite.
Evidently the Briton is easily satisfied.
# * #
Apart, however, from its extreme age—a
quality which it shares with stale meat and
the Great Wall of China—the chief feature
which makes the Englishman feel proud of
his monarchy is that it doesn’t do very much
harm. He is eminently suited by nature to
grovel to an institution which doesn’t do
very much harm. The British monarchy is
enormously expensive. It makes sycophancy
fashionable, and the British middle-class
abases itself before it, like a naked China-
man before his Joss, till it forgets how to
stand upright, and becomes mentally bowed
and bent. The royal family has for many
years done a profitable business in seduc-
tion ; it has made immorality fashionable,
and has cast a halo round the divorce-court,
and still more questionable institutions. It
has produced idiots and drunkards and pro-
fessional gamblers, and other dubious char-
acters, and for two centuries this is the best
that can be said of it. The English nation
recognises these facts, and cheers vocifer-
ously because its royal family isn’t any
worse. It pays it immense sums of money
for not being any worse, and yet without
the slightest hope that it will ever become
any better. No hereditary monarchy ever
does become better. The atmosphere
of grovel and adulation in which it
lives makes it grow more and more
vicious and ignorant. Its dreary, pur-
poseless existence, its shoddy pretence of
usefulness, the incessant fooling at dismal
ceremonials vyhich make up its whole being,
leave it one-half gilded waiter and one-half
bedizened flunkey. Its business is to feed
and smile, to make horrible speeches that
no one listens to, and which would do no
one any good if they were listened to, and
generally to be fat and stupidly good-
humoured. Still, after all, the matter is
one which principally concerns the British
race itself, and if that race w'ants a
king or any other such property it is
nobody’s business save its own. The nation
that pines after a monarch is generally the
sort of nation w r hich deserves to have a
monarch. And even if the British republic
never comes at all it makes little difference
to the people of Australia. Possibly Eng-
land is getting too old for serious political
changes. It is an unsafe thing to put new
wine into old bottles, and when a new Com-
monwealth is put into an old, cracked race—
well, the race might burst.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Finality.
The man who cables so many strange asser-
tions from London has sent out the following ;
In an article on constitutional politics to-day, the
Times quotes from the speeches of Sir Henry Paekks and
Sir Samuel Griffith, delivered at the Federation Conven-
tion, as distinctly supporting the paper’s contention that
the realisation of Mr. Gladstone’s scheme for Horae Rule
for Ireland will not secure unity or finality in legislation.
What Parkes or Griffith says on the subject
of Home Rule, or on any other subject, or what
the Times says, or what the Times says that
Parkes says, is, of course, a matter of small
account. The one noteworthy circumstance is
that the Times evidently thinks it has uttered
a blasting condemnation when it says, in effect,
that Ireland will never be satisfied, and that
when it gets Home Rule on the Gladstonian
plan it will still want more and still more—in
short, that there will be no end or finality in
Irish legislation. And seemingly the cable-
man also thinks that there is something im-
portant about the statement or he wouldn’t send
it out, and the Australian dailies think that there
is something remarkable in it or they wouldn’t
publish it. The Times opposes the Home Rule
Rill because the Irish nation will immediately
ask for something more, just as the Argus
opposes any concession to Labour, because,
when it is granted. Labour will immediately
want more concessions. The Tory paper is
always calling out for some finality in legisla-
tion, and it never realises that there is no
finality anywhere under the sun. It shakes its
solemn old head, and remarks in a deep, fat
voice that the other party is a party with an
ill-regulated mind and is never satisfied, and,
therefore, it must be “kept down.” And,
strangely enough, it never occurs to the Times
that there is no end to English legislation
either—that nobody looks forward to any time
in the future when Parliament will have made
all the laws that the nation will ever want, and
will adjourn for evermore because the con-
stitutional machine is complete, and can be
left to run the empire without supervision.
The Irish Home Rule party, and the Austra-
lian Labour-party, and every other demo-
cratic party in existence, are solemnly re-
probated by the orthodox Conservative organs,
because they are never satisfied, and their
demands have no end. But then nobody is
ever satisfied, and the discontented organisa-
tions which incessantly ask for more only do
what all the rest of the world is doing. There
is no finality about the Times, even ; if there
was, that paper would stop publication some
morning, and there would be a notice on the
door stating that the proprietors had made all
the money they wanted and had closed up. The
Argus has no finality about it; the< labourers
whom it complains of so vicious!yjS'flways want
more wages, and the ancient paper always wants
move advertisements and more subscribers.
When the One-man-one-vote Bill came before
the Victorian Assembly the Argus complained
that if that measure was passed the democracy
would still be dissatisfied, and plainly regarded
that as a good and valid reason why it should
be rejected ; at the same time there were nearly
60 other Bills on the notice paper, and it was
an admitted fact that if they were passed 60
more would turn up next session, therefore it was
quite evident that the whole nation was equally
dissatisfied. If finality is a desirable thing then
the Legislature should reject every measure
that comes before it and shut up definitely,
and the papers should stop publication, and the
parsons should stop preaching, and the money-
grubbers should stop grubbing, and everything
should come to a sudden stoppage. The old,
hide-bound Tory always wants to know, with a
howl of consternation, where the other party is
going to stop, and the natural answer is that it
is going to stop when the world stops, and not
before. And till then there is a horrible
absurdity in anybody cabling out that there is
no finality in the demands of Ireland, or any
other place, for there will be no finality in
anything right up to the day when everything
bursts and shrivels up and dies, and probably
even that won’t be final—who knows ?
Why are Irishmen Protectionists?
It may be safely asserted that 'were there no
“Irish Question ” there never would have been
a fiscal question. After 1840, the Freetrade
agitation began to decay in England. The
votaries of Bright and Cobden were so few as
to scarcely deserve the name of a party. In his
“ Life of Bentinck ” Disraeli shows how
people regarded them as cranky faddists, akin
to the vegetarians and vivisectionists of our
own day. Years afterwards, when Cobden
died, Bright admitted that famine itself had
come to their aid. As a matter of fact, it won
them the battle. It was the Irish famine, and
nothing else, which produced Lord John
Russell’s Edinburgh letter and Peel’s sudden
conversion. But for that terrible event, Eng-
land would possibly be a Protectionist country
to-day. Terrible as the famine was, the
effects of Freetrade on Ireland have been
worse. A man may quickly recover from
violent disease, but slow poisoning is sure
in its results. Up to the famine, Ireland’s
population increased and her material progress
was considerable. Since that event, though
seasons, crops &c. have been as good as they
were before, she has year by year declined.
The result is due to Freetrade. The abolition
of the corn laws forced the Irish farmer to turn
his arable land into pasture. This dispensed
with the agricultural labourers, who emigrated.
Their presence as hewers of wmod and drawers
of water—competing in the unskilled labour
market all over the world—is a tribute to Cob-
denism. For some years the farmers were able
to make a bare living and meet the landlord’s
rents by raising stock. But, like the labourers,
they too soon realised the blessings of Free-
trade. It is claimed that Michael Davitt
founded the Land League. The most powerful
man—and Davitt was poor and friendless—
could not of himself establish such a movement.
Had Davitt died in prison we probably would
have a Land League all the same. The Irish
farmers could not exist without a League or a
rebellion. Towards the end of the seventies
the ocean steamers introduced the refrigerating
apparatus and were able to land the beef of
Manitoba and the mutton of Maoriland in
the English market at a price impossible to the
local producer. The Irish farmers could not
compete with rivals who knew neither landlord
nor bailiff. Nor could they avail themselves of
the favourite freetrade device by “turning
tlieir hand to something else.” They had done
so once already, but now they must either emi-
grate like the agricultural labourers, and thus
abandon the holdings in which their all was
sunk, or fight the battle of the desperate. They
preferred to fight with a result now well known,
though people ignore the fact that Bright and
Cobden were the real fathers of the Irish Land
League. A Roman Catholic is not necessarily
a Protectionist; logically an Irishman is.

“ England’s Natural Granary.’
At last advices Britain, France, and Spain
seem about to join in a murderous scramble for
the possession of Morocco. Britain wants it
because it wants everything ; the British nation
has already got one-sixth of the globe, and it is
as hungry for more land and more conquest as
it was when it had nothing save its own little
island. France wants it because its solitary
little colony of Algeria is alongside Morocco,
and if its octopean neighbour gets Morocco it
will want Algeria too. Spain wants it because
Britain has already stolen Gibraltar on one side
of the straits, and if it gets Tangier on the
other then the chance of getting rid of the
Anglo-Saxon land-grabber is rendered more
hopeless than ever. And lastly the Moors want
to keep it for just the same reason that the
Englishmen want to keep England, but the
murderous Christian takes no account of them
as they are weak and badly-armed and few in
number. Up to date Britain, as usual, was
ahead in the rush for plunder. There is a
wondrously cold, brutal, callous, and utterly un-
feeling style about the British Christian, and his
utter inability to look at any question from any
standpoint save his own is a marvellous thing to
contemplate. Ordy last year Premier Salis-
bury prophesied that Morocco would presently
become “a trouble to Europe ” and “a menace
to international peace,” which was, taking it
all round, about as capacious a lie as can be
found anywhere. And now the British news-
papers unanimously agree that the prophesy has
come true, and that Morocco is a menace to the
tranquillity of Europe. Not one among them
seems to realise that Morocco isn’t a menace
to Europe, but that Europe is a menace to
Morocco ; they all speak as if the little Moslem
State was threatening to carry fire and sword
through Britain instead of Britain threatening
to deluge it with blood and then devour its
remains. The “Moorish trouble” begins to
loom up in large print in the papers just as the
“Turkish Question” used to do, but the only
Moorish trouble is among the brigand states

■who are quarrelling over the plunder of the
Moors, and there hasn’t been a “ Turkish
Question” for 300 years save the question
among the pirates who longed to gnaw
the bones of the dying empire. This
blatant hypocrisy glares forth in every paper in
England and in every purely English paper
in Australia —and unfortunately they are very
numerous. The Argus, for instance, is purely
English ; so are the S.M. Herald and the
Sydney Telegraph— there is not one Austra-
lian feeling or aspiration among the lot. This
slab from the Telegraph is a fair sample of
English sentiment in its stupidest and most
callous sense, as that sentiment is imported for
Australian consumption :
The once potent, stronghold (Gibraltar) being thus
rendered obsolete by these new conditions, and the neces-
sity of thus protecting British traders passing through
the Straits being now greater than ever before, it is
essential that means of affording this protection should
be obtained. . . . But, apart from this, Morocco itself
is regarded as the only natural granary of Britain.
Fatuous drivel ! Britain sends ships through
the Straits of Gibraltar — therefore, Britain
should steal both sides of the Straits for
the protection of its ships. Nearly every
other maritime power on earth also sends
ships through the same strait, but none of them
should steal it because Britain is the only
country to be considered. Britain sends ships
to the United States, therefore, on the same
basis, it should steal the United States. France
sends ships to Britain, consequently France has
a moral right to annex Britain. Every country
that sends"ships to another country has a right
to annex that country, by the same logic.
And Morocco is the natural granary of England.
Why “natural?” England claims India because
it is the “ natural ” stamping ground of her
freebooters, and Egypt because it is the
“natural” highway to India, and South Africa
because it is another “ natural ” highway, and
Morocco because it is a “natural” granary.
Everything is natural so long as it means loot
for the British highwayman and the British
snuffler. The dull egotism of the thing is so
vast that no one but an Englishman could have
perpetrated it. If Morocco is the natural
o-ranary of England, where is the natural
granary of the Moor ? Isn’t England
itself the place that Nature meant to
be the Englishman’s granary ? and wasn’t
Morocco obviously intended as a feeding-
ground for the Moresco population ? Or, if
Morocco is the granary of any outsider, why
shouldn’t it be for France or Spain, and how is
the Telegraph’s Anglo-maniac so dead sure
that everything was constructed for the use and
convenience of one blatant little island ?
A Prisoner’s “ Privilege.”
Dear Bulletin, —Some anonymous person has
been groaning his soul out in the papers over
the provision in the new New. South Wales
Criminal Law Amendment Bill that allows a
prisoner to give evidence on his own behalf sub-
ject to cross-examination. He is troubled to
think of the number of criminals who are going
to perjure themselves and go scot free. Of
course that is all bunkum. Everyone with even
the slightest experience of criminal trials
knows that the “privilege” will “shop ” about
ten times as many as it gets off. So long as it
only gets at the guilty, it is, on the whole, an
improvement in the law ; though with the
criminal law, as it is in New South
Wales, the breaking-down of the case against
a man who is technically guilty is often the one
chance he has of getting justice. But the real
danger of the enactment is that it will bring
innocent men to grief. The two main principles
to be kept in mind are that all men are liars,
and that every accused person is considered
guilty until he is proved innocent. The reverse
of this last proposition is the theoretical legal
doctrine, hut in practice it is applied as I have
stated it. Being primd facie guilty, every
word the prisoner in an ordinary case may
say on his own behalf will be looked on by
the jury with suspicion, and disbelieved at
once if it conflicts with the independent testi-
mony of, for example, the prosecuting constable.
Hitherto, the prisoner has been allowed to
make a statement, and, as a general rule, the
best thing he could do was not to make it. If
the facts proved against him are ugly, and he
tries to explain them away or disprove them,
the jury feel that it is just what they would do
in his place, and marvel at his simplicity in
doing it so badly. If he does not contradict
them or try to put them in a new light, then
his silence is treated as an admission of guilt.
The fact of his making his statement on oath
will not help him. The jury will quite appre-
ciate the weight of his temptation to commit
perjury, and if his story be at all improbable,
they will assume that he has committed per-
jury, and not think much the worse of him for it.
If the positions were reversed, they know
that they would do the same. But every
admission he makes on cross-examination
that tells against him will have its full
weight. With the Crown Prosecutor it
will be “ heads I win, tails you lose.” Further,
even the innocent prisoner will almost invari-
ably tell lies, that will convict him to a dead
certainty if he is bowled out. It is very rarely
you find a witness who can resist the temptation
to throw a little embellishment into his story
to make the case look better for his side. Wit-
nesses do it unconsciously, and many an honest
witness has the whole of his evidence discredited
because on some insignificant point he is proved
to have made a mis-statement. This is so even in
civil cases when a ten-pound note is in question.
Think of the position of a man charged with a
crime of which he is innocent, but in a blue
funk at the thought of possible conviction and
the black look of the circumstantial evidence
against him ! If he has not a level head and an
unusual amount of intelligence or experience—
and these qualities are not conspicuously pre-
valent in the criminal 'dock—he will jump at
the chance of improving the appearance of his
case by a little innocent exaggeration. He will
see no harm in stretching the hundred yards
into half - a - mile, or changing the dusk
into bright moonlight ; and the evi-
dence which upsets his testimony on
these points will bring his whole case tumbling
to the ground. On the other hand, if he is
warned of the danger of going into the witness-
box, and holds his tongue, the jury will look on
that fact as affording in itself a strong pre-
sumption against his innocence. I t is merely
an expansion of the old formula : “ You are not
obliged to say anything unless you desire to do
so, but whatever you say will be taken down in
writing and may be given in evidence against
you upon your trial.” Any man accused of a
crime can go into the witness-box and give
evidence against himself. It is in very rare
cases that even an innocent man can say any-
thing that will really tell with the jury in his
favour. — Horsehair.
The other day, in one of the New South Wales
Labour-leagues, a whole squad of Single-taxers
rolled up to join the organisation. They were
all members of the Single-tax League, and had
sworn allegiance to that body, and they also
proposed to swear allegiance to the Labour-
league, quite irrespective of the well-known fact
that no man can serve two masters. There-
upon, one old member pointed out that, when
the next election came round, the two leagues
would both, without doubt, nominate candi-
dates in their own interests, and as nobody
could well vote for both parties, he wanted to
know whether the new men intended to break
their pledge to the Single-tax-party or to the
Labour-party. They unanimously declined to
take any notice of this very natural question,
and the conundrum still remains unanswered.
The explanation, however, is sufficiently simple.
The Single-tax men join the Labour-leagues,
not with a view to supporting Labour, but in
the hope of bossing the leagues, and securing
the nomination of Single-tax-cum-Foreign-
trade candidates on the Labour-ticket. In
other words, they hope, by careful mani-
pulation, to get the support. of the Labour-
partv for their own fad, and Labour itself
may" go to Tophet so long as Foreign-trade
and the Single-tax get through. The situation
of the Single-tax men who join a Labour-league
is just the same as that of the libertine who
joins the Social Gimlet Society—in one or other
of-his two diverse capacities he is obviously
acting as a spy and an enemy in disguise. If
the Labour-leagues are not warned in time, a
split is inevitable in the near future. They
might as well hope to strengthen themselves by
recruiting capitalists and bankers and pawn-
brokers as by taking in Single-taxers, When a
person pledges himself to one society to put
Georgism first on his political programme, and
to another that he will strictly adhere to the
Labour platform —which has no connection
with Georgism—then he is lying in one of his
two capacities. And you can generally tell
which capacity he is lying in by noting which
society he joined last.
The New South Wales scourger having been
given full charge of a country gaol in recog-
nition of his faithful services (the Deniliquin
people, by the w r ay, declare that they will never
tolerate his presence as governor of their prison),
the question arises, how are the authorities
going to suitably recognise the services of the
hangman ? If the fiogger can be made into a
full-fledged gaol-governor, why should not the
hangman also govern a gaol ? Of course, the
authorities will point out that this particular
fiogger is, and has for many years, been a
warder on the Penal Department list, whereas
the hangman is only a minion of the Sheriff,
and is not a penal officer at all. However, this
purely technical plea by no means disposes of
The Bulletin’s contention that the appoint-
ment of a person holding the revolting office of
stipendiary torturer, to the complete charge of
an institution both penal and reformatory, is an
unspeakably horrible example of the coarse-
mindedness, not to say brutality, of the
traditions of the New South Wales Penal
Department. It is a loathsome thing that the
fiogger should be a gaol-warder at all. Let the
Penal Department strike off this official from
the list of warders and set him down as what
he is—a man-flayer. And if the fioggers of the
future are to have promotion, let them be made,
not into gaolers, but into hangmen and night-
men, and so on. If the fiogger is entitled under
the regulations to promotion of an impossible
character, let the Government give him special
compensation —and take care that the next
creature whom it employs to skin people alive
thoroughly understands that there is no pro-
motion for him until he goes to Heaven, or gets
the hangmanship.

Dr. Patrick Moloney, of Melbourne, had the
pluck to maintain, as a medical expert witness
at the inquest, that the proof of Mr. T. P.
Fallon’s insanity when he committed suicide
lav in the act of suicide itself. That any man
of sound mind can deliberately kill himself in
cold blood is a supposition which has never
commanded the support of common-sense, nor
ever will so long as millions of unfortunates are
to be found fighting for the means to eke out a
miserable, hopeless existence. Doctors in
general—notwithstanding that the habitual
practice of professional humbug is apt to
fuddle their common-sense are loth to
accept the time-honoured verdict of felo-
de-se, inasmuch as it is not in accordance
with the first law of nature. Yet medical
witnesses seldom or never have based their
theories of suicide - insanity upon the simple
fact that the natural desire of every living
thing, human, animal, or vegetable, is to live
as long as possible. They testify to the appar-
ently disturbed condition of the corpse’s mind
before the act, or perhaps to certain evidences
of insanity in the family history, if it has a
history. But the fear of offending silly old
prejudices, combined with professional love for
indulging in technicalities, and making a moun-
tain of a molehill, has deterred doctors from
expressing a candid opinion that suicide, while
the average unhappy survivor is recognised as
a sane person, must be madness.
The high Tory St. James Gazette rises to
prove that republicanism and mediocrity go
together, and that monarchism is the only
system which brings men of genius to the front :
What manner of men have been the Presidents of the
United States and the Presidents and Premiers of France
in our own days? With the solitary exceptions of Grant
and M'Maiion— skilful soldiers, but little more—Abra-
ii\m Lincoln and Gambrtta, they have been medio-
crities or nonentities. Sometimes they have been worthy
citizens, like Grew and Garfield 1 ; sometimes they have
been Andrew Jacksons and Rouviers. For the most
part, good men of business, irreproachable in private life,
capable of conducting themselves with dignity, free from
ostentation, and discreet in word and deed, but, so tar as
real ability or powers of leadership are concerned, no
better than thousands of their fellow-countrymen. During
the same period monarchies have been governed by men
like the three German emperors, by Prince Bismarck,
Cavour, Palmerston, Beaconsfield, Mr. Gladstone, Lora
Salisbury— men whose place in history is assured ; and
yet the delusion still prevails that not only do republics
provide political careers for men of genius, but that in a
republic the man of genius must of necessity become the
ruler.
This is genuine Tory logic. Of the three Ger-
man emperors, one was only a drill-sergeant,
the second was a shadow who did nothing as a
ruler except die, and the third is a meddlesome
person with a sore ear. Lord Salisbury is, as
Premiers go, mere mediocrity ; Beaconsfield
was a mountebank and a political scene-shifter,
and Bismarck, Cavour, and Gladstone are
the only great men of the lot. It took three
monarchies to supply them, and two republics
turned out four great men in the same period
—not counting Thiers and Jeef Davis, both of
whom were about as great as Cavour. Then
the short-lived Spanish republic produced
Prim, Castelar, and Serrano each of
them worth six or more of Salisbury,
and a whole crowd of other monarchies
—Sweden and Norway, Portugal, Greece,
Holland, Belgium, Bavaria, Wurtemberg,
Saxony, Russia, Servia, Roumania, and Turkey
—failed to grow one ruler of common intelli-
gence among them. Even Victoria doesn t
amount to much in point of intellect, and no
republic has yet grown a ruler like Collars and
Cuffs. Moreover, the great end and purpose of
republicanism is not to raise a crop of geniuses
in high places, but so to organise the state that
it can get through without them. The heaven-
born statesman, by virtue of his brain, generally
becomes an autocrat, and then some fool comes
after him and inherits his autocracy, and it
would have been better for that country that
it had possessed no heaven-born statesman

The meaning of “12 months’ imprisonment’
varies considerably in Victoria. Jimmy
Mirams and his brother Edward are cases in
point. The year served out to James was
found, first of all, to include the time that
elapsed between his conviction and the passing
of sentence upon him, and this liberal discount
on the gentle penalty of the law was further
increased by the “ usual allowance ” (which
isn’t so very usual) for good conduct. The little
man of figures proved, in fact, that 12
months go into 9 once and none over. As for
Edward Mirams, convicted of embezzlement
as a public servant on July 15 last, his 12
months were commuted to 6 months by the kind
Governor for the reasons that he had restored the
stolen money, and wasn’t looking well, and was
supposed to feel peculiarly degraded at having
been found out. Now, six months from last
July 15th would, in the ordinary way, expire
upon January 15th of this glad New Year, but,
by some new and improved system of reckon-
ing, Edward Mirams’ commuted sentence
expired on December 24th, in time for him to
toddle home to the Xmas goose. Let this
touching illustration of Hopetoun’s clemency
be remembered when the next hanging job is
brought under his notice.
A Male View of Marriage.
In a forceful article on the difficulty experienced
by marriageable women in getting husbands,
London Referee, after pointing out that the
present monogamic system of marriage embodies
the triumph of woman in civilisation, and show-
ing that though Christianity has helped woman to
secure the exclusive right and interest in the
father of her children, she would have attained it
all the same under Paganism, proceeds thus
While the men have been occupied with their politics,
arts and sciences, the women have been slowly improving
and consolidating their position inch by inch. We have
been too good-natured and too chivalrous to attempt to
wrest their advantage from them, and the result is what
we see—that marriage is an institution with almost indis-
soluble bonds and far-reaching responsibilities, all de-
signed in the interests of the weaker party to the con-
tract.
* * *
Well, having got matrimony into its present condition,
how' do the women work it? Being strong, are they mer-
ciful ? I think married men will agree that the tendency
is to work the system with considerable rigour. There
must be no late' nights at the club, no unusual expendi-
ture of money that is not accounted for, no polite
attentions to a strange lady. 1 have even heard of
an agitation against latchkeys, tobacco in the drawing-
room, lazing on Sunday afternoons, and other entirely
innocent forms of masculine indulgence. The modern
theory of marriage, of course, is that the wife,
having drawn a husband out of the lottery, stands
watch and ward over' him so as to keep at a distance
all possible rivals. This position men have tacitly
accepted, and if matrimony meant this, and only this, there
w'ould not perhaps be so much fault to find with it. But
the woman, as wehave seen, is inclined to push heradvan-
tagetothe verge of tyranny. To return to the com-
mercial metaphor, she sets a very high price upon marriage
indeed. Foi* the helpless man who becomes involved in it
it is too often a state of continued self-denial, verging upon
privation. I do not mean in the money sense exclusiv el,\,
though that also has to be considered, but as regaids the
general amenities of life. Now, commercially, you cannot
legitimately run up the price of an article without giving
value for it. If you do not give value for it you must take
the risk of the article remaining on your hands, and this
is just the point, it seems to me, at which we have arrived
in this marriage question. The average young man who
puls his head in the matrimonial noose renounces
(1) the enjoyment of a considerable portion of a
slender income, (2) a good many of his customary
evening pastimes, (3) the delights of indis-
criminate larking with the young persons of his
acquaintance. And, in return for this, what does he
obtain ? (1) A home which is not much better, although
considerably dearer, than the one previously furnished
him by his landlady; (2) the companionship of a wife
who with her newly-acquired airs of authority, has
ceased to be as nice as the unattached young ladies of his
acquaintance, all of whom were wont to buzz around him
like a fly in a jam tart; and (3) the paternity of children,
a boon which many authorities in these Malthusian times
are inclined to view askance. Is the bargain an altogether
desirable one for the average young man ? The women
may shout “Yes” in chorus until they are black in the
face but, meanwhile, the average young man, who is the
other party to the bargain, shakes his bead and walks
away. In commercial language, he is not taking it on.
m * *
It is a matter of common observation that if men do not
fall into matrimony in the callow period of the early
twenties they take a run of bachelorhood till they are
forty or more, and in a good many cases never marry at
all There must be something wrong with a system
which, while it entraps ufl-wary youths, tends to repel the
man who is fully arrived at years of discretion. No
amount of theorising about the blessedness of the married
state will do away with this significant fact, that among
men, after two or three-and-twenty, the marriage cuivc
declines, not to rise again until they are getting into the
sere and yellow. The conclusion clearly to be drawn is,
that for men with all their wits about them, and in the
prime of life, marriage, as at present organised, is not
usually thought to be good enough. They find it rather a
one-sided bargain, and they will have none of it until
they begin to want gruel o’ nights, when the wife comes
in handy as a sort of confidential nurse. The cry is not
that women want to marry more than they used to do,
but that men want to marry less. Every woman still
wants a husband, but every man does not nowadays want
a wife. Commercially speaking, wives ask too much for
themselves, and the marriage market in consequence is
dull. For it does not matter whether you pay for an
article in hard cash or in self-denial, you pay for it all the
same.
* * *
Matchmaking is no longer a question of bringing two
congenial souls together. It is almost synonymous with
trickery, and the reason is that it is hardly conducted
upon fair principles, the young man being often lured
into an alliance from which his better judgment, if left to
itself, would probably recoil. I was discussing this ques-
tion the other day with a marriageable young man of
about thirty—rich, cultured, and idle, and living in a
fashionable flat in the West-end, wdiere he is waited upon
hand and foot by servants. Many have been the attempts
made to capture this desirable husband in posse. To me,
he talked of them with undisguised amusement. “ I
was nearly caught once,” he said; “ but that was some
years ago. I was actually engaged for about a week. At
the end of that time, thank Heaven, we had our first
quarrel, my Dulcinea and I, and I took devilish good care
that it should be the last. All the time I was engaged 1
felt I had been let into doing a foolish thing.” “And
now?” I enquired. “Ah, now,” he replied, “lam a bit
wiser. You won’t catch me at that sort of thing in a
hurry. In vain is the net spread in the sight of the bird.
Look at me,” he added ; “why should I marry? 1 have
everything I w : ant.” And he laid a stress on the every-
thing. This is not an exceptional case, and the more’s
the pity. London is full of such young men. They are
not all rich or idle, but they are all pretty much of the
same way of thinking. They have practically everything
that they deem it worth while to live for. When they
come to be fifty, perhaps some of them will reconsider
their position ; "but, meanwhile, the women they ought to
have married will have been stranded in old-maidenhood.
~# * *
The only remedy for this state of things is to cheapen
marriage—in other words, to make it more attractive.
Women have screwed up the bond so tight that it is in
many cases irksome to bear. This bond must somehow'
be loosened so as to allow a healthy amount of play for
masculine idiosyncrasies. I am not prepared to say
exactly how the thing is to be done, or \vhat is the best
way of doing it; but, in a general w 7 ay, it may be said
that the constraints of marriage have been pushed a little
too far in certain directions, and that the worst enemies
of the bond are precisely the well-meaning people who
are agitating in obvious defiance of Nature’s precepts for
a further equalisation of the sexes. It is worthy of
note that the working classes are the marrying classes
of our day. Now, it is precisely amongst those classes
that the constraints of marriage are least felt. Work-
ing men and women know little of the deadly struggle
of keeping up appearances, and, among them, the
wife is, in sober truth, the helpmate of her husband
which in the upper classes she so often fails to be. Un-
doubtedly the natural inclination of the sexes is to come
together," and if any considerable number of eligible
women remain unpaired the reason must be sought in the
artificial conditions of marriage ala mode. I attach little
importance to the natural inequality of the numbers of
men and women respectively. It is the fact no doubt
that the consumption of male life is greater than that of
female, and that, although the males are in a majority
when born, at fifty years of age they are in a slight
minority. About the marrying age, or what ought to be
such, however, the sexes are tolerably equal, and if every
Jack paired off with Jill the residue of single women
would not be worth agitating about.
* * *
On the part of men there is probably as little real
repugnance to marriage as there is on the part of Church-
men to the burying of Dissenters. It is not the end but
the means that is objected to. I can imagine a young
man who hears of the hardships of nice young women in
failing to find husbands, and in being denied the joys of
maternity—l can imagine this young man, I say, re-
pudiating warmlv and very sincerely the alleged dis-
inclination of his class to make the pretty dears happy, and
exclaiming, “ Not marry them ! Why, I shouldn’t mind
marrying a dozen, if they will only say the word.”
It is invariably the case that when a law is made too
stringent for the ordinary necessities of human nature it
defeats its own purpose; it either falls into abeyance or
human nature dammed up in one channel overflows into
another. The extremely complicated provisions of the
French law of marriage are probably responsible for the
excessive number of irregular unions in France, and the
indulgence with which they are regarded—a point I com-
mend to the attention of the morality-mongers in our
midst. That polygamy is the true remedy for the exist-
ing state of things, as" some bold spirits have suggested,
I doubt; for in the countries where it prevails it is
defeated partly bv the natural instincts of mankind and
partly by the fact that there are not women enough
to do much more than go round. Possibly increased
facilities for divorce would have the effect of rob-
bing marriage of some of its terrors. I make this
suggestion with diffidence, and only because the
case seems almost a desperate one, But, after all, it
is a terribly serious business putting your hand into the
bag and drawing out a partner with whom you are com-
pelled to pass the remainder of your life whether you
prove to be congenially mated or otherwise. There is a
very wise Italian saying to the effect that all the brains
are not in one head. It applies to nations no less than to
individuals. Now, over a very wide stretch of human
history, and even among civilisations that have been
little, if at all, inferior to our own, a comparatively
slight matrimonial bond has been deemed sufficient to
safeguard the interests of the community. The tie of the
children might be trusted more than it is to hold couples
together. At the same time, divorce being rendered
possible, say, by mutual consent, men would probably
hesitate less than they now do to incur the responsibilities
of # *
# I fear there is nothing for it but to apply to the matri-
monial market the same inexorable laws that regulate
other markets. The possible purchaser cannot be forced
—he must be induced—to buy, and the most obvious
means to this end is that women should abate some of
those pretensions of theirs which are the bane of middle
and upper class life. Their fault, like that of the Dutch
in commerce, is giving too little and asking too much.

T. S. RICHARDSON,

[?]
846 Macquarie-slreet North, Sydney, January 13, 1892,
My Dear Moorabinda, —
This is what a visitor saw at a certain Sydney suburban
clergyman’s house the other Sunday. During a heavy
thunderstorm, in the afternoon, the household cat
brought her half-drowned kitten into the rev. gentle-
man’s drawing-room. Of course, the expounder of the
gospel of love called for some warm milk—of course. But
first he merely screwed the baby-oat’s neck and then
dashed it down on the hearth. Next he pitched its ma
out of the window. The same evening, in the pulpit, the
same shepherd, with upraised finger and eyes rolling
heavenward, read out the hymns with most melting
pathos.
The actor-man and his female prototype have astonish-
ing little ways of their own sometimes. For instance, on
Ihe very day that a pair of well-known Thespians got
their decree nisi made positively absolute, the lady to
have the custody of the che-yild—on the very day that
Justice realised their hope of you-go-your-way-I-go-mine,
the ex-husband was observed parading the lawn at a swell
cricket-match, with his stagey infant held by the damp fist,
prattling gaily to its ex-papa, while the divorced mama
beamed lovingly' on the twain. What angels of forgive-
ness and mercy some women are 1
I read that “diamonds and an uncramped waist are
Mrs. Bernard Beere’s drawing cards,” so I want to
wearily rise and submit that the intelligent Australian
public yearn, histrionically, for something more than
these. A spreading, unbusked diaphragm leading to
those eccentric-looking up and down night-gowney gar-
ments belted in round the place where the lady generally
feels hungry first—makes the weary seeker after Paris
fashions a prey to fitful melancholy every time the star
t rips over the trail of her slim fit bandaging in crossing
the stage. And, as for the diamonds—we have had so
many gifted precious stones playing lead to enthusiastic
houses, and then discovered that they were only bogus
stuff—paste and brass, while the real stingo were looked
up safely at “my bankers,” that we view the advent of
these sparkling jewels with an expression of tired incre-
dulity. What we want most is the actress whose trump-
card is simply heaven-sent genius—what histrionic charm
is there in a jewelled stick with no stays on?
And—still growling about “ no corsets”—these brilliant
London actresses who kindly take our breath away now
and then in one way or another may say they don’t wear
stays, but they forget that a belt by any other name will
pinch as tight. What do we find really supports their
lissome shapes? Heart-breaking cuirasses of leather ;
gaspingly tight barrel-shaped bandages of iron-strong
material. The dictionary definition of stays is “ any
support”—and if a length of tanned hide bound round
your carcass isn’t a support it would be interesting to
know what is. All actresses are kept straight (physically)
by something or other—perhaps not of whalebone, silk or
rushes, but what is equally effective. They never go out
d la Nautch girl, lithe and straight, with their undulating
bodies simply bound round by a yard of muslin. And
don’t you forget it.
In one or two weddings that have eventuated lately, the
most pitiable sight (after the bridegroom, of course) was
the chief bridesmaid, making a plucky attempt to un-
button the bride’s glove and lift her veil—the veil-lifting
process, by the way, always makes me think of a Chinese
matrimonial sacrifice, where the groom only gets a glimpse
of his Pansy Blossom in front of the priest, for the Cau-
casian happy man always glares at the drooping, unveiled
visage as if he had never seen it before. But this is a
frivolous digression. The first bridesmaid can’t juggle
with her own vegetables, the bride’s bunch and glove,
and lift the piece of tulle which catches on every projec-
tion, all at the one moment, so it is now the best man’s
pleasing task to relieve the burdened maid of her flowers
when she commences to grapple with the bride’s etceteras.
But at a recent marriage honoured by my presence, the
best-man stood and never lifted a finger, and clumsy was
no word tor the full-fisted gambols of the head-maid round
the white sacrifice of the hour. She couldn’t help it, poor
girl, for she was laden like a pack-horse, but I hope some-
body let the best-man know what a prize idiot he made of
himself at the top of the church.
Talking of weddings—a fresh-caught specimen from the
shady side of Pall Mall tells me that “ chief bridesmaid ”
is an obsolete expression that would be Choctaw to a
whole club of Johnnies, and that “best woman” is now
the correct terra, dontcherknow, old chappie. But I
don’t think it will answer very long, do you ? No brides-
maid would stand it, and when the anxious query rose on
the breeze, “Where is the best woman?” it’s ten to one
the bride would modestly rise and intimate she was just
here and the bridesmaid would rise, too, and glare at the
sacrifice and remark in a choked voice that Somebody
wanted to be Everything, and the whole misunderstanding
would end in a whirl of hartshorn and cut stay-laces, pro-
hably. The bridegroom doesn’t mind coming nominally
second, but a woman must be the superlative of the
whole ceremony all the way from “ dearly beloved ” to
the end.
The strange, fantastic collection of alleged art sent in
by Sydney amateurs to the annual art contest, and tem-
porarily hung on screens (the work, not the artists) in
Sydney Art Gallery, had a few redeeming features,
although one grows sceptical in front of an unequal
oanvas with weak work everywhere but in the principal
effect, where one or two nervous strokes incongruously
redeem an otherwise spineless composition. It suggests
that the “ teacher ” did something more than throw his
shadow across the canvas (not to put too fine a point
upon it), but what can you expect? The childlike trust
of the promoters of amateur art contests simply invites
double-dealing—no othe* coni] on is so left to th
honour’ of the student. For instance, what a lot o
passes would come out of the University if candidates
were allowed to deal with their papers at home I The
only way to honestly get at the true qualifications of
these artists-elect is for one of the committee to bo
wherever they pitch their easels and throw bricks at any
mysterious individual with long hair and a slouch hat
who hovers in the neighbourhood.
hy the way% the unplaced amateur studies of ladies and
gentlemen mit nodings on took a trick. I have often
wondered where artists find these perfectly-proportioned
women with “languorous languid limbs,” and I know
now that they' simply pad ’em out. These amateur
nudities I have just been inspecting are honest human
beings drawn just as Nature made ’em. Hence one lady
has razor-sharp shoulder-blades, fore-arms as fiat as a
lathe, and a head set on her collar-bone ; and one gentle-
man in a bathing-suit is quite a little Falstaff round-
about. They don’t look pretty, but just think of the
realism of it!
Sydney Nurses’ Home has declared a deficit for ’9l,
simply because the typhoid didn’t blossom in the winter
with its usual vigour. The influenza god-send (I am
writing strictly' from the Nurses’ Home point of view)
threw a lovely radiance over the merry Spring, and
created a mild boom in the Sisters Dora, but the sinful
effects of the sanitary state of the winter could not be
kept away by the common or garden sneezing of a ration
of cheap invalids, who only wanted their gruel reg’lar,
and had none of these welcome whims which provoke
extras in the nurse’s bill. It’s a very sad state of things
if the lay community could only’ see it—-a bevy of sacri-
ficing females, eager to smooth the pillow of pain and
supply the whole population with a deluge of barley-
water, only nobody sets up a pillow, and nobody cries
out for pap. But things are often contrary like that, and
there is, after all, a silver lining to every cloud. Perhaps
smallpox, trimmed with jaundice and finished off with
brain-congestion, wdll be the fashionable indisposition of
to-morrow,
I don’t know w’hether men get reckless about their
artificial rind when “everybody” has scooted and the
Block is the loveliest spot in town, but I do know that the
summer young man in the city' is the funniest free
spectacle going. He is so woefully patchy, with the air
of an economist who amalgamates the—that is to say,
continuations, of a bygone suit, which have borne the
wear and tear better than the other concomitants; the
coat of another, which kept gamely’ on, elbows and
all, when the rest of the set was fluttering on the
family tramp, and the absolutely’ new-looking vest of a
third. There isn’t much fault to be found with his
apparel separately—but it’s the inharmonious whole
which makes you wonder whether his tailor forbids him
to mention his name under pain of attachment for libel,
and if he had stood out in a storm of slop clothing and
grabbed what fell nearest he couldn’t look more haphazard
than he does. Now, if I were a bank-olork and wanted to
knock out the residue of my wardrobe liae that, I would
carry a fishing-line with me wherever I went. The
heterogenous what-is-it I have seen goin’ fishin’ leaves
the summer clothes economist nowhere for sartorial eccen-
tricity, so people don’t wait to waste criticism on a man
with a hook hanging out of his pocket.
We don’t hear so much about the Sydney tailors’ strike
as we used to, but there is at least one man in Sydney
who will never forgive nor forget it. A Sydney hostess-
presiding genius of an establishment to which he had
long and hungrily wished for the right of familiar entree
invited him to an afternoon at home, and he, meaning
to blossom like a dummy’ in brand-new rags, went on his
knees to his own particular ninth part of a man and
begged him to run up a suit by such and such a day. The
day came, and the youth joyously hied him to dress at
his tailor’s, but, alas ! owing to the belligerent attitude
of the wielde.rs of the yard-measure the garments w’ere
still in dock ! The tailor seeing he had a desperate man
to deal with, hit on a desperate expedient: "We are
much of the same height,” he said, “I will lend you one
of my suits - but remember, I must have it back before
the shop shuts at six p.m.” Of course the frantic dude
adopted the conditions, arrayed himself and went, and so
ingratiated himself with the hostess that he was warmly
pressed to stay and dine. Then the iron thraldom in
which he was held by his tailor’s suit of clothes obtruded
itself. He refused in the most embarrassed manner the
soft pressure of the lady, and at 5.30 fled precipitately
from his Paradise mortally offending the hostess by bis
unfaltering haste. He got the get-up back on contract
time—a hollow consolation, for Mrs, de Potts Point has
never seemed to see him since 1
Viewed again—from a mobbed auditorium with Dion
Boucicault hanging so far out of the manager’s box that
his head was an inky blot on the gorgeous stage pictures
(en parenthise it didn't look well to see him effusively
bowing to friends behind the scenes—but this may be a
mere matter of prejudice), and a pretty girl in filmy
oream robes and a twinkling diamond necklace rendering
the d.c. radiant—“ Forty Thieves ” was revealed again to
be the same glittering patchwork ; the only signs of wear
and tear are the Fairy Bobby’s wings which are a little
out of plumb, and the big hole in Zaide’s black silk
thumb. The dresses in the first ballet are angelic—white
gauzy fabrics lavishly constellated with gold stars,
draped over flesh-pink limbs with white doves nestling on
shoulders and in hair. Amanda Noel, the limber
premiere danseuse, whose dancing is sylphish in the
main, only she oughtn’t to try to come thud onto the
stage until the big drum gives the rub-a-dub-dub which
conceals the fact that her jumping weight is 11 stun—
rather spoils the effect of her heliotrope ballet-skirts and
etceteras by the oily way she fixes her raven hair. A
little more furze like the down of a thistle is one of the
things which makes the gallery whistle.
The return to the native “kawdiny” of the festive
sassiety matron whose notion of living down a shrieking
scandal was a trip to England whither her Petrarch also
hied him, and where she was seen cabbing it with
him in London by several sharp eyes—has thrown
Southern sassiety into a ferment and one ex-
friend of the offending angel’s, who was very chummy
with her in the old days, has packed up and fled to Eng-
land with her husband to avoid the unpleasantness
of her arrival. Society is going to glare at her with
a stony expression in its eye—more particularly since it
has come out that her husband called at Government
House recently and implored the Governor to ask the
repentant sinner to dinner immediately on her arrival-
just to stop tongues from wagging—hut the head of
sassiety refused to apply the whitewash-brush on this
occasion. A reply w’as sent to the effect that “ her name
would duly be considered when it appeared on the visitor’s
list,” and the applicant faded away into impending social
darkness. On <Ut that this latest discovered frisky isn’t
so very sorry about it as hubby wants to make out. It
was her fault, the whisper goes, that the engagement was
broken off between her aristocratic “ friend ” and the
English “gal.”
The true social inwardness—or social outwardness,
rather, of vice-regal receptions was, a correspondent tells
me, beautifully exemplified during the ceremonies in
connection with the opening of the Tasmanian Exhi-
bition. The Hamiltons, it seems, “ recepted ” at
their Launceston residence, and the representatives of
the various Exhibition Courts were cordially bidden ami
characteristically entertained, and seem to have retire
>n the usual “ me and the Governor ” frame of mind that
an hour or two’s tolerance on the part of the top of
any kawliny always seems to engender in the male
and female haunters of Guv’ment House. But alas ! the
reception was sadly and sternly official, though the
received didn’t think so, and continued to tell little
pointless anecdotes about what “’Amilton says to
me”—until the Governor’s bail, when not one of
the Exhibition gods was invited to join in the
mad surge after sardine sandwiches ! Chaos
came again and the air was filled with the gnash-
ing of disappointed teeth—especially on the part of the
Berritish representative who blenched at the insult to his
evening suit, and sat down on the spot and stated his
bitter grievances-on six sides of foolscap which he posted
Home first chance. But it seems a great waste
of nervous energy because (I am informed) the
ball was a very ghastly business—haunted by all
the people who had managed to keep afloat during the
Van Diemen affair—but with a wee bit only in the stock-
ing, and no money to buy new frocks. Yet the repre-
sentatives “ cut up nasty ” because they weren’t bidden to
waltz with first family insolvency in last season’s tulle
and satin, and hand fat, stone-broke dowagers down to
supper six times in the hour ! Beally, I believe there are
some people who w ould esteem it an honor to be invited
“ to meet a bailiff at Government House ! ”
During the vice-regal pic-nic-ish"pause at Kiandra two
alleged mountains were rechristened by Lady Jersey and
Lady Galloway. The latter (who holds the proud position
Of being the first woman Her Excellency has regularly
chummed in with in this heathen land) called her emin-
ence “ Mt. Salisbury,” after her brother, her naive
explanation being, “that its position in the range corres-
ponded exactly with the position occupied by my brother
in England”—British family pride is truly a shy and
timid thing—but, all said and done, the distinguished
women might have dubbed the everlasting hills Mt.
Smith and Mt. Tomkins for all it really signifies. “ The
district ” will cling to the same old, quaint, aboriginal
christening of these points in the landscape, and the new
and strictly English appellations will be out of use before
the baptismal wine has dried off the tree-trunks. Who,
in South Australia, minds any of the brand-new names
which Governor Kintore distributed about all over the
place in his memorable journey in the shade of the
telegraph wires?
In re the newsboys’ night at Sydney Criterion, it is
interesting to hear a local daily talk pathetically about
“300 youngsters—many of whom probably had never
been inside a theatre before.” The little impish oddities
who swarm in the streets with their ephemeral stock-in-
trade are regular patrons of Saturday night drama.
“ Are yez goin’ to the play, Bill ?” is a leading question if
you listen to them, and their chief hope is the man who
comes out of a theatre at half-time in disgust, and who is
besieged by these self-possessed mannikins for his pass
out, on which they, of course, pass in triumphant.
Sometimes they achieve a ticket of a good-natured dress-
oircler, but it’s generally stalls and gallery. I remember
going into a Sydney theatre as the smoke-and-have-a-
look-at-the-w’eather gentlemen surged up for the second
act, and among them was a little ragged robin of the
newspaper variety, who stepped briskly up to the aston-
ished Cerberus with his pass and then surged on with the
rest into the realms of fashion. Ten minutes later he was
lounging in a velvet chair leading the applause.
The “Doll and Pincushion” contest, in aid of the
Centennial Convalescent Home, will eventuate in Sydney
Town Hall during Easter, and I am glad to see that (com-
prehensively) “a fair” will help the rather silly main
ideas of the bazaar on to a substantial gate. Miss L.
Oreagh and Miss Addison, 11 Elizabeth Bay Road, are
hon. secs.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Go’s. “Cascade”
80 & 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is just
the place; it is certainly the largest and best
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
fiarcels sent there so that they can call for them
ust before taking the tram for home.*

With the recurrence of the pantomime
season bobs up serenely the refined and cultured
individual who can see nothing in the seasonal
show but the baldness of the dialogue, the incon-
sequence of the topical gags, and the entire
absence of anything like a plot or a story. We
grant this complete category of objections, and
more also ; but when pantomime is manned and
mounted like the “Forty Thieves,” at Sydney
Koyal, there are points about it demanding some
other attention than mere wholesale and conven-
tional condemnation. In the first place, Gordon’s
scenery is the substance of things hoped for and
the evidence of things not hitherto seen; the
stage groupings and costumes are superb; Pattie
Frown, John Gourlay, Fred. Mason and Harry
ohine are clever and versatile people whom no
pantomime drivel can extinguish, and the
wonderfulness of the Graggs is genuinely
011 a P ar with the adjectives of the
show-bills. Often a Shakespearian play is
revived for no other earthly reason than
that it affords an opportunity for a magnificent
spectacle spectacle being thus recognised as
worthy legitimate theatrical effort. This being
so we have a right to regard spectacle for its own
sake, and the “Forty Thieves” fairly bristles
with it. Ensembles like the marshalling of the
nations, the Grand Bazaar of Bagdad, the gather-
mg of the “Forty ” in the forest cave, and the
bridal procession in the last act, are things of
genuinely artistic beauty. Nobody in his senses
expects a pantomime to be a tragedy or a grand
opera, and, taking the Royal’s show for what it is,
we must recognise it as a real and solid success.
One of the features of the entertainment is the
Gragg family, who come on in aristocratic even-
ing-dress attire, and execute wonderful things in
many varieties of tumbling. Ihe Graggs have for
ever redeemed the profession of the acrobat,
ihey are so irreproachably costumed that one
might easily mistake them for peers of the realm.
Henceforth dukes and earls may execute double-
threes and human ladders for the delectation of
fashionable drawing-rooms, and the Lord High
Chancellor may indulge in ground and lofty
tumbling for the amusement of Her Majesty the
Uueen, the Prince of Wales, and all the Royal
Family.
** * *
At Her Majesty’s the babes are nightly
prospecting the wood in the presence of good
houses, this is about the most wonderful panto
mime we have ever seen in our life, based as it is
on a dreary exhortation to a flaxen-haired maiden
to pull up her socks. This phrase is repeated
with variations of intonation for nearly three
hours and a half, and if there ever was any
originality in it by the time the curtain falls it
is pretty thoroughly exhausted. Of course Her
Majesty’s pantomime is Maggie Moore, whose
infinite variety, like that of Cleopatra, can stand
the wear and tear of successive pantomimes
without losing its bloom, or showing any signs of
withering. The Babes themselves are uninterest-
ing little scamps, whose chief concern in life
appears to be an exaggerated tendency to undue
interest in the fate of cheap hosiery. The wicked
uncle,_ Sir Rupert, has injured his foot, and his
pla.ce is now filled by the erstwhile Friar Tuck,
and this monster of iniquity—Sir Rupert, not the
Friar—with the aid of two versatile valets, who
play upon uncanny musical instruments in their
leisure moments, wades in a highly picturesque
fashion from villainy to virtue, in the short space
of three hours, to take up his scoundrelism in. a
reprobate fashion on the following evening at
half-past seven. But nobody worries very much
over the uncle or his accomplices; or evqn over
the historic babes themselves. The centre of
interest is Robin Hood (Miss Maggie Moore)
and Maid Marian (Miss Bella Bashall),
and on their amours, songs, dances, dresses,,
and general achievements the fate of the"
pantomime _ reposes. The scenery at Her
Majesty’s is good, and the groupings are
brilliant and effective. The bird ballet and the
fairy dolls’ ballet are the plums of the piece, which
is as well staged as anything hitberto produced
by the management.
** * *
Talking about pantomimes reminds
that the transformation-scene at Her Majesty’s is
introduced by a flap-trap variety of gigantic
Christmas card conveying the compliments of the
season to everybody in particular from one
“G.R.”—which, of course, stands for Georgeous
Rex. Now, why should handsome George thus
go back on the triumphs (and otherwise) of his
youth, and forget the happy days when Henry V.
bossed the limelight and shed a benediction on
the tank ?

Pollard’s Juvenile Opera Co. continues to
hold the boards at Sydney Criterion, but “La
Mascotte ” has given place to the “ Mikado,” who
appeared before a good house on last Saturday in
the person of W. Percy, and his presentation of
the name-part was as artistic as one could expect
from so young a performer. In the revival of this
opera two youngsters have been added to the
troupe Robert Clough, soprano, and Harry
Leader, alto—and a decided acquisition they are.
The success of a juvenile troupe is always conn
parative—we do not say “it is good, intrinsi-

caily;” we say ‘‘it is good— for children.’’ The
child usually spoils his work, at first, by nervousness
and stage fright. When he has gained confidence
lie spoils his work by over-confidence, slipshod
oarelessness, or downright exaggeration. Now
young Robert Clough as Nanki-Foo, and Harry
Leader as Pooh-Bah, although obviously nervous
and lacking in knowledge ot stage business, sang
correctly and acted intelligently, and, by contrast
with their evident earne tuess, the playing of
Ko-Ko (Alf. Stephens) and Pish-Tush (H. Quealey)
seemed over-done and the characters somewhat
burlesqued. The opera goes very well on the
whole, and suits the capabilities of children much
better than “La Mascotte.” Certainly one must
expect a lot of squawkiness in juvenile efforts of
the kind ; but the singing of Clough and Leader
was remarkably free from any straining after
effect, and was' also, for children, fairly artistic
and cultured. Little Lily Stephens was admir-
able in the character of Pitti Sing, and her song in
defiance of Katisha was encored to the echo. Miss
Flo. Russell deserves high praise for her make-up
as the Mikado’s daughter-in-law elect, and the
scenery and mounting of the piece are of respect-
able calibre.

. If anybody desires to be moderately
astonished they should pay a visit to the Poly-
technic, the management of which cool retreat
has secured the services of Mr. E. Lloyd Lewis,
one of the cleanest-fingered and gentlemanly con-
jurers we have ever seen cheat the senses. He
appears to have mastered the secret of the fourth
dimension and to have brought Mrs. Besant’s Ma-
hatmas within the range of conceivability. He also
thumps the piano with more than mere muscular
ability. At the Garrick the Coghill’s “ Brook ”
is trying against adverse shows and diverse cir-
cumstances to emulate the eternal “ goingness ” of
Lord Tennyson’s rivulet, with Horace Bent as a
fading show-name ; and Sheridan is rather in-
effectively attempting to seduce theatre-goers to
the wilds of Darlinghurst; but during the panto-
mime season the big theatres have all the variety-
show attractions, and the lesser establishments
have a hard job to draw a respectably-filled house.

Melbourne theatres are fighting hard
against Prevailing Depression, but depression
threatens to prevail in most cases. The banks are
vaguely reported to be putting the screw on the
dress-circle, and the stalls are suffering from a
reduction of salaries. Also the pit has a dark,
gloomy appearance of not being on the job, whilst
the family-circle stops at home a good deal and
takes out its dissipation on the concertina. As
for the gods, they display an unmistakable ten-
dency to chuck up the legitimate and heave their
bloomin’ patronage at the circus. Not but what
Sells Brothers’ big variety show attracts people of
every class and gives pleasure to all. There is
much virtue in a mob of elephants, and the out-
line of a hippopotamus is something that touches
the soul gently, so to speak. The wild Bedouins
of the Desert carry on in a manner that meets
with general approval, nor has custom altogether
staled the clever performances of the Silbons and
the Shirks. The lady who coyly submits herself
to a boa-constrictor’s cuddle is an especial
feature of interest for men who have seen
snakes under less enchanting circumstances,
and the artists handicapped with the appel-
lation of ‘‘funny clowns” seem indefati-
gable in the pursuit of humour. The horse por-
tion of the entertainment is creditable, consider-
ing that the quadrupeds are as yet but raw
amateurs at their work, and a dozen other items
in an immense bill are remarkable for everything
except originality. Moreover, the entertainment
calls for respectful mention as a leg show, one of
the lady jugglers being joyously draped in next to
nothing at all. She resembles an angeUrathing in
a short length of silvery waterfall. Taken alto-
gether, Sells’ Circus deserves to boom. The com-
pany, exclusive of elephants, hippopotami, and
beasts of prey, is colossal, whilst the Friendly
Societies Gardens, situated at a respectable dis-
tance from the madding crowd, offer many attrac-
tions to the girl who means to extract a definite
statement on the tender passion question as she
drags her male victim through the dark and
stilly night. The weather thus far has been very
favourable to widows and spinsters of strong
determination.

“ Dick Whittington " keeps up a big
average at the Theatre Royal, nevertheless. The
literary structure of this glittering annual is
nearly as shaky as it could be, and the good old
story has been brutally knocked out of all
coherence, but splendour atones for stupidity in a
great measure, and two or three nice new girls
cover a multitude of sins. The fact that a far
better pantomime might have been fixed up at the
same high price has probably escaped the notice
of the parties chiefly interested, and will not make
more than i>2ooo difference in the gross receipts,
perhaps.

a live boy at evt ry meal. It looks as though th ( '
monster would soon have to get fed by contract
from a baby farm, where human vittles are as
cheap as chips and no questions asked. A topical
duet is about the saddest feature of “ Jack the
Giant Killer,” although a melancholy individual
in a kilt runs it pretty close. Sometimes, indeed,
the skirted Scotchman makes a violent effort and
gets his knees first past the post. That’s when he
has one of his worst fits of humour on him.

“The Merry Monarch” improves some-
what on acquaintance at Melbourne Princess’.
Always gorgeous and regardless of expense, this
American novelty has been touched up in the
musical department, and seems less like an under-
done pantomime than it did at first. The Nautch
dance, too, grows in favour, and the subtle inanity
of King Elton’s policy towards ambassador Lanri
is better appreciated. Furthermore, Florence
Young becomes a sweeter vision every time. Her
flimples make one glad to begin with, her voice is
always in good order, and her beau but the para-
graph has broken down under its emotion.

There is nothing new to observe concern-
ing “ Much Ado About Nothing ” except that
love-sick Claudio is commonly regarded as a
richly-upholstered lunatic. Any young man who
engages a prince to do his courting for Jnm must
be hopelessly wrong in the upper storey. It’s
against nature. What would the world say of a
modern Claudio, who went gasping and snivelling
to Albert Edward, and asked him to do a gracious
mash on behalf of his timid myrmidon ? The
world would say little, but think a terrible lot.
The idea is entirely monstrous—sending a prince
to tell your love, and canoodle with the girl of
your heart in a moonlit shrubbery. One might as
well despatch his romantic passion to the cook by
means of a policeman. The erudite James Smith
has supplied the Argus with a two-column dis-
course on the birthplace of Dogberry, in which he
observes that the breath of a new life is already
blowing over that ancient city. High time that
it did. Unfortunately the popularity of B. & B.’s
Shakespearian production is beginning to blow
over likewise.

The Gaiety Hall show has been strengthened
by the engagement of a high-toned and elegantly-
embroidered troupe of Japs., who do all the feats
peculiar to their country with a bland and trustful
smile. They travel under the name of Godayon,
and constitute a select family party, the blushing
marriageable daughter being in the habit of blow-
ing canaries into a cage whilst her progenitor
spins a top along a thin string. The Victoria
Hall, Waxworks. Cydoramas, and Exhibition
Concerts are getting a'ong-as usual, but the Alpine
Picnic collapsed at St. George’s Hall several days
ago. It is horribly cold in the Alps and the picnic
soon froze up.

A matinee at Melbourne Princess’ last
Saturday benefited the Australian D. and M.
Association to the handsome tune of £2lO. An
act of “ Merry Monarch,” ditto of “ Much Ado,”
and a bright performance of “Trial by Jury”
(with Brough on the bench), were assisted by a
strong variety show. The novelties were A 1 an
Morris, the new baritone, who gave an air he had
previously sung at a Liedertafel smoko concert
witli much success, and a Miss Adey Brunell.
The lady recited “ Godiva ” in a dainty, spiritual
style, and overcame the difficulties of her subject
like an artist. But Maccabe, who tipped 'em the
Wandering Minstrel’s top-note and immortal
cough for about the ten-thousandth time, carried
off the cake from all com ueti tors. The Minstrel
never seems to grow any infirmer or older as the
years roll on. He simply grows funnier.

George Musgrove has arranged with Sir
Augustus Harris for the importation to Australia
of a magnificent grand opera company, including
musical director, stage manager, costumieres,
armourer —to fix up the mediaeval knights in mail,
we presume—and all other attachments. The
company will play six weeks—or 3(5 performances
—in Sydney, and produce at least eight operas,
including Wagner’s “ Lohengrin,” Gounod’s
“Romeo and Juliet,” and other expensive
rarities. The condition attached to this enter-
prise is that £OOOO must be subscribed at once,
as follows ; 320 d.c. tickets at £0 (each good
for 18 performances at 10s. each), A2BBO ; (500
reserved stalls at £4 10s. (or os. each perform-
ance), ,£2700; 600 stalls at £2 145., £1(520; 1000
amphitheatre at £1 165., £lBOO. The terms are
so low that if there is any possible demand for
grand opera in Australia the subscription list
should be filled at least six times over.

The recent suicide of the lady-help in Dampier's house,
calls to mind t he still stranger one at G. B. W. Lewis's, St.
Kilda Hoad. He had a lot of old theatrical scenery stored
in a shed, and the servant girl was found inexplicably
dead, between two of these flats. We suppose a romantic
atmosphere is bred in an actor’s house, with the awe-
struck and yellow-covered-novel-reading girl listening at
the chinks to Otheller and Hamlick.
G. V. Brooke’s life, by Lawrence, is positively announced
to be issued this month, January, in London. Brooke’s
sister, wife of Kev. Canon Heatley, contributes Brooke s
letters from Melbourne, and there is one from Forrest to
Brooke, about the Macready riots, New' York. Strange
to say, Brooke wrote a poem on the drowning of the
tragedian Elton, in a shipwreck between Edinburgh and
London.
Here is how dramatists make money: Boucicault,
£40,000 in one year ; author’s profits £lOOO in one week
for the last successful Drury Lane drama ; Grundy,
besides a heavy lump sum, takes 10 per cent, of Hare’s
profit, £lB,OOO, on “A Pair of Spectacles;” Jones
grumbles at having only £3OOO for a play, because the
manager got £10,000; Gilbert has received £90,000 in 11
years, while the whole profits of the Gilbert-Sullivan
operas tot to a million ; provincial rights of “ Carmen Up
to Data ” sold for £3OOO.
Bland Holt opened his Tasmanian season a few nights
ago with the “Bells of Haslemere,” and did the horse-
shoe-making business to,rights. When he proudly held
up the shoe, a gallery expert yelled, “ Where’s the .clip?”
This is the turn-up at the toe, very difficult to make, but
Bland is resolved on perfect realism.
Everybody, except three managers, is delighted over
Coppin scoring with his pantomime, but the scenic-artist
is more in evidence than any artist in all the Melbourne
productions. “Much Ado About Nothing” goes with
liardlv a laugh—how unnatural! under Bouoy’s perfection
of wooden marionette stage management. With Barry
Sullivan and Mrs. Heir, or Montgomery and Miss Cleve-
land, the laughter rippled from end to end—but Sass
ought to take Benedick.
The pantomime at Melbourne Royal will be followed by
“ Little Jack Sheppard,” with festive Billie Barlow as the
desperado, in place of almost forgotten Fanny Robina.
The late William Florence played a season at London
Gaiety, some ten years ago, in “The Almighty Dollar,”
but not even the recognised ability of the American
comedian could make such a preposterous play hum
outside his own country. Florence’s caricature of the
’Murikan politician was delightfully humorous, and his
wife, as the florid widow’who prided herself on having
“lived so much abroad,” made a hit. The rest of the
performance was rubbish, how ever. In fact, the “serious
inteiest” of a successful American play is usually so
stupid, as to make one marvel at the existence of any
sense of the ridiculous in that great country.

A member of the Early Closing Association, writing to
a Sydney daily paper, calmly says: "Theatres are only

amusement and recreation and not of work.” Lovely.
It is cabled that " Mr. Lawrence Irving, a son of Mr.

it was, but why does the cableman here use the formula

an attempt at suicide ?
The London Savages, writes our correspondent, gave
W. H. Vernon a great send-offi the evening before he
sailed for the Cape. Everybody of note turned up, and
it is long since so much talent was available to make up a
real good night. Amongst those who contributed to the
musical portion of the entertainment was Harding, late
of Harding’s Opera Company, of whom you know’ some-
thins:. By tlie way, Oracle I’Uisted is ptoj ii»g hi Cali-

Henry Arthur Jones, in spite of the critics, says our cor-
respondent, has scored with “ The Crusaders ” at London
Avenue, where it is almost impossible to secure seats
under a week’s notice. It was impossible that such a
clever and unconventional play should fail, interpreted as
it is by so many admirable actors. Henry “Avenue,” as
he is now called, has had trouble with the “no fee”
brigade, who gave a Jot of annoyance the first few nights.
He has explained that he is tied by the foot, as the re-
freshment contractor has the rightof selling programmes,
and that he asks an absurd price to cancel this privilege
something like £OO a week. H. A. has now adopted the
plan of giving the programmes away outside the door of
the theatre, but as this creates some confusion it is feared
that the police will put a stop to it. This monopoly is
certainly hard upon a manager who wishes to popularise
his theatre.
“Billy” Florence used to tell this yarn of his early,
struggling days. To celebrate a rise in salary of another
dollar per week he treated his sweetheart (subsequently
Mrs. F.) to a banquet of oysters and lemonade in a New
York saloon. On going to the counter to pay he found
his pockets empty, and as poor Juliet was also bare of
capital, a distressing scene ensued. The oyster-man
sneered aloud when Florence gave him an address at a
theatre. He would put no trust in theatrical princes and
preferred to send tor the police. Just then a grave, long-
bearded man stepped forward. His cheek flushed with
indignation ns be called attention to the evident respect-
ability of the young couple, and begged the honour of
settling their oyster account on the spot. Planking down
a ten-dollar bill and picking up the change with a care-
less, haughty air that, made the purveyor of shellfish
realise his own meanness, the venerable stranger escorted
Florence and his frightened mash out of the place. They
both showered thanks upon their friend-in-neul, and
Florence asked for his card, with a view of repaying the
oyster loan and expressing more gratitude next morning.
“ Never mind that,” said the old gentleman—“ I did very
well out of the affair. It was a had ten-dollar hill.” lie
whisked round the corner, and Florence never saw him
more.
So far, U'Oyley Carte’s experiment with English opera
has been a very expensive failure. The artful D’Oyley,
however, does not lose much, you may he sure. The
principal sufferer, says our correspondent, is Mrs.
Ronalds, a very rich American lady, who can afford with-
out inconvenience to indulge her taste for musical art.
She went into this opera spec, in order to bring out
Eugene Gudin, whose fame it has really established. It
is not by any means had for trade that so many wealthy
American women have some hobby or other. The mis-
fortune is that they don’t always get into such respectable
hands as those of D’Oyley Carte.
Kyrle Bellew, says our London correspondent, has been
trying all he knows to obtain the lease of a theatre in
London for Mrs. Brown-Potter, without success. The
only houses that can he had at any price are the Royal
and the Globe, neither of which, of course, would suit
such a pair of swells. They have accordingly closed with
a voiy favourable offer for a tour in South Africa, and will
start almost immediately for that new theatrical Tom
Tiddler's ground. They declined a very tempting pro-

very do htful if a second edition of Brown-P. would be

Charlotte Cushman, I he great actress, once met and fell
in love with an actor named Clark and got him promoted
to leading parts. One night she was waited upon by a

her in her own dressing-room until the play concluded,
when she sent for Clark. Tableau ! That cured her of
loving actors.

There was a hit of sharp practice over the purchase of
the Australian rights of “True Hearts.” A man from
Sydney, lunching at the Savage Club one day, happened lo
mention that he thought the play would suit George
Rignold, and that he would buy it if lie could find out
who owned the copyright. Somebody overheard this,
and the result is that George, or someone else, has the
rights for the modest fee of three guineas a performance.

Among his other gifts Snazelle includes the useful one
of flattering an audience suitably. On his way hack from
Adelaide he put in three nights at Warrnamhool (Vic.),
and at the close of the first performance to a good house,
he told them that he had intended to go straight on to
Melbourne, his experience of country audiences in S. A. not
hating been favourable. “But,” said he, “my friends
strongly advised me not to miss the Athens of the South,
the home of culture, Warrnamhool; and now 1 do not
regret having taken their advice,” and so on, and so on.
And didn’t they roll up on the two succeeding nights !
A Sydneyite, recently visiting-let us say-Tasmania,
found himself in a pretty little town, and went into a

Premier Bibbs displayed real political tact
when he got the reporters to wire this nut to the
Sydney press for the associated masters to crack :
‘ The men are justified in resisting the lowering
of the price of coal if it affects their wages. The
associated collieries have no need to reduce the
price of coal, as it cannot in any way affect the
export trade. lam opposed to the reduction in
the hewing price, as it will have the effect of
lowering wages. The reduction is unjustifiable,
and is almost a criminal act on the part of the
associated collieries. ’’
How far the English “tipping” habit
sometimes increases wages was shown in a case
tried the other day in London. Plaintiff was a
t rim young servant in the house of Lord North-
brook, where defendant also was. There had been
love passages between the pair, and a sympathetic
jury decreed that the male must pay the sum of
*.£125 and costs for breaking his promise to marry
Bertha. It transpired that, while the salary of
the defendant, T. Smith, was £5O a year, his
annual income amounted to £6OO. The balance
consisted of tips !
According to the Hummer, leaving out a
few big cheques made by extra-good men, and
concerning which the squattupressocracy have
“blown” much, this is how the average shearer
panned out last season:—Shorn 3690, for which he
was paid .£36 18s. ; deduct £4 for travelling
expenses (fare only, not his ex. s) to the different
sheds—£32 18s. ; deduct rations. &c., <£6 ss.
.£26 135.; divide by 13 weeks (the time employed)
£2 Is, per week. This, taken from actual tally !
Very much worthwhile to come up from Maoriland
for that. If you take out also any generous man’s
personal ex.’t — clothes, drinks, a shilling or two in
(say) the church plate, the hospital collection, and
in subscriptions for disabled shearers, and you get
to understand what a lordly time the shearer has.
A yarn is told on the Murrumbidgee of
how a union shearer met a station manager.
“ Any chance of a job, boss ?” “No ; the unions
have set the (carnation) country on fire. Shearing
will be £5 a hundred next year, an’ I s’pose the
(ruddy) ronseabouts will want £2 a week. Yet
the (naindattity) unionists have the cheek to ask
for work. See you (sheep a ashingly) well (gorry-
bunkited) first. I'll employ non-union men when
I want ’em.” Next day, as the same boss was
rushing to put out a fire which had drifted into his
own rarns’-paddock, he met the same man, and
said : “Gome along, yon, and bear a hand to put
out the fire.” The unionist coolly sat down on
his swag, and expectorated. “Well, are you
going to sit there all day, like a dam fool, and the
grass a-blazing away to damnation Hades?” “You
keep yer’air on, now; wotyer growlin’ at? If /
was a squatter as thought unionists set my grass
a-fire, I’d only employ scabs to put it out. Would
yer like ter see ray ticket ?” The squatter apolo-
gised, and the pair went over together like
brothers and soon had the fire out.

It was a strange whim that led Graham

About once in every minute and a half the lid of
the right eye drops completely over the ball. The

extent, no other feature of the face having moved
meanwhile. People who see the prince for the
first time are tempted to believe that he is de-
liberately winking at them, an impression which
is strengthened by the prince’s reputation of
geniality toward men and gallantry toward
women. Of course, however, the wink is altogether
involuntary, the result of a tic nerveux.
Miss Isabel Hapgood, an American literary
lady, has been on a visit to Count Tolstoi. She

We went in, great and small, but with no bathing-dress.
The use of such a garment on such an occasion would be
regarded as a sign that one was afflicted with some bodily
defect which one was anxious to conceal.
If this means anything at all, it means that Miss
Hapgood went in without any clothes on, in
company with Tolstoi and his friends. You need
to go to a strictly godly publication run by a very
profound saint to find cheerful little things of this
sort. For really “high” information, always
apply to a saint."

Three young men were brought to the
fore at Carlton (Melb.) Police Court, last week,
on a charge of stealing ducks. Two of them
obtained a free pardon, after explaining that they
required the market price of their share of the
plunder to buy railway-tickets for a trip up-
country. The third young man, being too town-
bred in appearance to work this “ up r country ”
theory, fell back upon a kick from a horse, which
had been administered to his brain in childhood,
and caused him to suffer from fits of duck-stealing
ever since. This unfortunate was also discharged
without the option of a fine, but the magistrates
thoughtlessly omitted to grant him a small gratuity
from the poor-box. It now remains to be seen
how the Carlton magistrates will deal with the
next Chow convicted of hen-lifting, in the event
of the heathen pleading that he impaired his
intellect by falling out of a window when he was
young.
An enthusiastic humourist who signs him-

on him suddenly, and he fled like an
ostrich to the telegraph-office so as to make
sure that it would be in time for next issue
of The Bulletin. It was charged extra because
the department took it for a cipher. The same
day another man telegraphed to ask us if it was
really true that London was larger than any other
two cities on earth, and asked us to wire back an
answer in red-hot haste. He had made a bet on
it with another man, and they were both prowling
round with a famished expression waiting to seize
the money. This sort of thing helps to lighten
the path of the tired newspaper man. We have
telegraphed back a lot of geographical information
to the men with the bet, and herebv thankfully
acknowledge the joke from Cairns, "and we now
sit down to have a well-earned rest.

Dear Bulletin, —In re “Rolf Boldre-
wood’s ” assertion, in his “Squatter’s Dream,”
that the aborigines were constantly “ensnaring
of eels ” in Riverine waters, I cannot, probably
through natural denseness, understand what light
your correspondent “Delcomyn” has thrown
upon the subject in a recent issue of The Bul-
letin, or even what meaning he wishes to convey.
I simply deny that eels have ever been found in
Riverine waters, and emphatically affirm that
their existence in those waters is unknown to all
our great scientists. I don’t care a brass farthing
for “travelled bushmen ” or what they think or
say. I never spoke about cod-fish ; and let me
tell your correspondent “ Delcomyn ” that the
fact of cod-fish being found, as he says they have,
in the “Logan and Albert rivers in South
Queensland,” has no bearing upon the question in
dispute.—Yours, H. J. McCooey, Redfern, Jan.
7th, 1892.
Pene Parekuku, the most famous native
doctor in Maoriland, and the oldest in all Aus-
tralasia, has just passed in his checks at the
reputed age of 103. He was semi-paralytic, and
one side of his face was dragged right round to his
ear. Also, he was tattooed in blue patterns, and
his body was shaped like a corkscrew; he was
hideously ugly, and in his latter days he was
partially deranged and subject to fits. But he was
a successful physician in his way, and in his last
hours he bequeathed his prescriptions by word of
mouth to his bereaved tribe. His remedy for
fever was a mass of treacle on top of the head.
For jaundice he gave soap pills, and he treated
lethargy by putting snuff up the nose, and suffo-
cation —from whatever cause arising—by blowing
down the patient’s throat with a pair of bellows.
In cases of dropsy he made his patients eat tar,
and in attacks of raging madness he tied the
sufferer’s head under a pump and pumped on him
till he was healed—or the pump broke. In very
obstinate cases he used to pour hot water on the
lunatic’s head and ears out of a kettle, and try
incantations. Probably his most practical remedy
was the one he recommended in cases of dog-bite—
“ Kill the dog.” Pene Parekuku had, for nearly
twenty years, about the worst cough in Maori-
land, and in later days he had cramps as well; he
was also suspected of witchcraft, but his followers
stuck to him, and he did a good business to the
last. Parekuku was exceedingly popular among
his female patients, and was a man of great
resource, and equal to any emergency. Once
and only once he came in contact with a
case of alleged strychnine poisoning, the patient
being a girl of 17-or thereabouts. The old man
diagnosed it as insanity at first, and pumped man-
fully on the sufferer without avail. Just here he
noticed that she was tying herself up in all manner
of hard knots and making her body into an arch
in a curious fashion, and he went straight to the
root of the complaint. Under his direction two
powerful old hags seized her by the feet and two
more by the shoulders, and among them they
straightened her out so violently that she had to
stop her convulsions on the spot. Then the
doctor pumped like a fiend for nearly four hours,
and ultimately the sufferer recovered. As a
remedy for strychnine-poisoning, this process is
worth noting.

Bankers’ Monthly.
During the last six years N.S.M. has
added 20 millions to her public debt, and has
decreased her annual expenditure by two millions.
The N S.W. Socialists are going to have a
big innings shortly. The reasons for this assertion
will be seen in a week or so.
Just listen! The whole of the N. S.W.
Permanent Force are entitled to free passes on the
State railways when on leave of absence for their
holidays!
Says the Australian Star We do
not express an opinion whether the N.S.W. tram-
be syndicated.” What! Are they
in it too?
Robert Dixon, whose death Is cabled from
England, was formerly in S.A. Parliament, and
was one of the first and most abused advocates of
Protection in that province.
The bad language used by Premier Dibbs
to an interruptive elector, the other night, was a
mild paraphrase of Parkesian phraseology and
shows how forceful is example.
Sir John Bray, the new S.A. Agent-
General, represented East Adelaide in b.A.
Assembly continuously for 20 years. The first
break would have been in 1894.
Parkes justly says that Daniel O’Connelb
the Irish “Liberator,” was one of the foremost
champions of Freetrade. How does this suit the
“ more Popery than fiscal ” theory ?
E. W. O’Sullivan denies that he has
auarrelied with Premier Dibbs over Major Parrott.
We notice, however, that he does not say the same
with regard to the military and other estimates.
Only two titled Premiers in the Australias!
Forrest (W.A.)and Griffith (Q.) Dibbs (M.S.W.)
and Playford (S.A.) have declined the honor of a
knighthood. Munro (V.) and Fysh (T.) covet the
bauble.
Australian Economic Association has just
awakened to the fact that the Trades and Labour
Council (N.S.W.) do not follow the “orthodox
economic reasoning” on social, industrial, and
political questions.
The leading potentate of the anti-demo-
cratic “National” Association of N.S.W. was,
not so many years ago, an ordinary storeman at
£2 10s. weekly. Having speculated luckily, he
takes his politics from Sydney Exchange.
The accession of Kingston to the Playford
Ministry was a surprise. Kingston also sacrifices
a large legal business which would have increased
when Symon, Q.C. went away. His greatest
friends say that he has made a big mistake.
Berry will be quite in the political dark
until he confabs with Munro. The pair will pro-
bably meet and palter, haggle and bargain. Han-
cock sharpens his knife and declares that the
general election will produce the Man of the
Hour.
Who is to be the next Pope ? The under-
stood candidates are three : Cardinal San Felice,
Archbishop of Naples, in the Anti-Jesuit interest;
Card. Vannutelli, for the Jesuits; Card. La
Yaletta, by the Moderatists, the party supported
by the king and court.
Hancock, in a political Pickwickian sense,
squirts a mouthful of tobacco-juice over Berry.
Even the Berry who left Melbourne wouldn’t do,
and as for the returned empty! Meanwhile,
Trenwith has gone to Queensland, and rather sits
on a rail over his old love Berry.
Parkes’ assertion, that he never assented
to the passing of the N.S.W. Treason Felony
Act, although he was Colonial Secretary at the
time, is unanswerable, for, excepting Parkes, all
the members of the “O’Farrell” Ministry are
dead, and dead men tell no tales.
The S.A. Licensed Victuallers are so
incensed with the “treacherous” action of the
Playford Ministry in supporting the Sunday
Closing Bill at the last moment that they have
instructed their president to absent himself from
the farewell banquet to Sir John Bray.
Sydney Daily Telegraph is evidently
run by two mules. One of them curses Protection
every day in the leading article because it makes
food dear, and wails over the “ consumer.” The
other one curses it because it makes food cheap,
and weeps about the ruined “producer.”
Has a workman with a wife and six
children and no allotment “ a stake in the
country”? Q.C. and M.L.O. Pilcher (N.S.W.),
the landed proprietor, avers that a bit of the
crust of the earth, a convertible asset, is the
only genuine “stake” a man can have in a
province.
Dear Bulletin, —One sort of Queensland
democrat are those idiots who couldn’t wait to
hoot Premier Griffith until the body of Rev.
Maclaren was landed at Cooktown. Parson
Maclaren was “ a white man,” and none know it
better than the labouring men of the North.
Wai Rimmkrai.
Sir William Manning (N.S.W) likes, as
well as one man two votes, one man two pensions.
His pension, as an ex-judge, and as ex-Solicitor-
General, is greater than was his salary as a judge,
and far greater than is the pension of ex-Ghief
Justice Stephen, after putting in 30 or 35 years’
service on the bench.
Tasmanian M.P.’s are gnashing their
teeth because a local paper has published a return
of the attendance of each member at the divisions
of the session. The country members especially
—-scenting domestic cross-examination from afar—
are puzzling their brains for yarns that savour not
of the “ same old lie.”
If Sir Saul Samuel is civil servant of
N.S.W., as his friends claim, why not pension
him on the ground of old age, and appoint an
Agent-General in touch with the people of the
province ? Sir Saul is old enough to be the father
of Bray and Munro, and almost old enough to be
the grandfather of Braddon.
The economical views of the democratic-
party in N.S.W. Assembly have caused a big
commotion amongst the “ distinguished ” officials
of the public service whom Parkes, for occult
reasons, honoured with big increases before the
last elections. The reductions in officers’ screws,
above certain grades, threaten to be of a sweeping
character.
“A CLEVER INVENTION."
She (a young-old gusher) : “Yes, that Mr. Edison is an awfully clever man. He invented

He (a cynic): “My dear madam, you must mean a woman."

Eye-glass Reid congratulates the invisible
Freetraders of Victoria on having “ risen superior
to the vulgar taste for being on the winning side.
Up till about three months ago Reid had the
vulgar taste to be on the winning side. And now
that he has been compelled to “ rise superior to
it his language is just awful.
The N.S.W. Assembly is likely to be the
scene of the biggest stone-wall ever raised by a
political party in the Austrahas—if the free-
traders don’t shake in their shoes at the critical
hour. M'Millan’s cry at East Sydney, last June,
is still ringing in their ears—“ Freetrade is safe,
federation is safe, and good government is safe.
A Maoriland paper declares that the so-
called “ books of reference” in the Parliamentary
library at Wellington are, in many cases, only
semi-obscene literature, purchased at the expense
of the country for the amusement of dirty poli-
ticians. After this, somebody had better overhaul
the N.S.W. Parliamentary library, and see what
it is stuffed with.
What is to cure the jar between England
and France over Egypt? Gauibetta was for
plunging in, and preventing England fiom getting
such a headway. Wise was. Palmerston in
fiercely opposing Waghorn’s overland route, and
Lessep’s Suez Canal, both terrific blows at
English prestige. Vasco di Gama killed Venice,
with the Cape route.
An English jockey wagered ho would win
the Dei by and get married within a week, and
some such an impulse leads the sportive Rosebery
to re-marry and publish his life of Pitt. Of course
the book is a sort of conservative glorification, but
in sooth Pitt was a villainously-iminoral politician,
a Liberal at heart, unable to resist the temptation
afforded him by King George.
Berry, Service, and Parkes have lived
down a lot. Twenty years ago Berry was all but
ruined, when his enemies secured a parliamentary
committee of inquiry, on damnative charges.
Garratt, Geelong M.P., followed him up with
vindictive fury, and the story goes that Berry
actually went on his knees to the committee to
pray that the evidence might not be published.
It never was.
Premier Playford, of S.A., is going to
India to “inquire into the best class of Indian
labourers for the initial settlement of Hindoos on
the banks of the Daly or Adelaide Rivers,
Northern Territory, which it was decided by Par-
liament to establish.” If there is any energy or
any reasonable intelligence among the working
classes of S. A., Playford will never get away alive
on such an errand.
Sir Geo. Yerdon has been visiting his old
constituency, Williamstown, with an eye to the
next general election. When he retired before,
old Tommy Mason was pitchforked in to keep
the place warm for him, but Williamstown has
been steadily growing more radical ever since.
The Yerdon originally ran a ship-chandler’s busi-
ness there, in partnership with one Probert, but it
is so long ago that he must have nearly for-
gotten it.
What journals were in the mind of the
S.M. Herald editor when he wrote: —“The
freedom of the press is a glorious thing, but the
gross abuse of that freedom and the degradation
of the press to the dissemination of vileness are
what no true friend of the freedom of the press
can sympathise with.” Was he referring to the
dissemination of the seeds of sectarianism by the
S.M. Heraldette— the uncommercial edition of
the Morning Luminary ?
President Harrison’s threat to use recipro-
city as his commercial weapon of offence and
defence against nations who do not burst with
Pan-American sympathies, will assuredly precipi-
tate the accomplishment of Salisbury’s predicted
war of hostile tariffs. It is but the latest fancy
invention in a truly Protectionist arsenal, and is
the dead block to Freetrade advance, unless such
a chimera as universal Freetrade ever became
possible. It is the principle of mutual accommo-
dation added to that of Protection.
How many heads of departments, over 60
years of age, are on the N.S.W. Civil Service
Board? Collector of Customs Powell, a connec-
tion of Premier Dibbs, by the way, is the latest
recruit: the appointment is worth a rise of .£lOO
to Mr. Powell. Is it feasible tha,t a board, of
which Parliamentary Draftsman Oliver, Collector
of Customs Powell, and Pensioner Rae—all oyer
00 years of age—constitute a majority, will retire
the fossils of the service? The board is a protec-
tion to the old fossils, and a bully to the widows
of civil servants—except in favoured cases.
Eye-glass Reid, in an oration at Mel-
bourne, said that “ neither in Victoria nor
N. S. Wales would the protective policy have
gained ascendancy had it not been for the
apostacy of the freetraders.” Quite likely. And
freetrade would never have gained ascendancy
but for the apostacy of the English protectionists
some 50 years ago. And Christianity would never
have got started but for the apostacy of the old
pagans. And Protestantism wouldn’t have began
but for the apostacy of the Catholics. Also nothing
would li ive been but for the apostacy of something
or somebody. Poor old Reid is always hunting
up some circumstance that is as dull and cominon
as a wooden fence, and firing it off as an alto-
gether new discovery.
Dear Bulletin, —The anecdote about the
late Sir E. Deas-Thomson and Alfred Stanger-
Leathes is incorrectly told. Your informant, who
got the story from “ Grundy,” I suppose, has
turned things upside down. These are the facts :
Mr. Deas-Thomson (loq.): “Mr, Deas-Thomson
if you please, Mr. Leathes.” Mr. Stanger-
Leathes (promptly): “Mr. /Stem/er-Leathes, \iyou
please, Mr. Deas-Thomson.” A great calm
among the venerable members of the board fol-
lowed the episode. Mr. Leathes was the last man
to take the initiative in such a matter. I was in
daily intercourse with him for more than 20 years,
and never addressed him, nor heard him addressed,
even by his most intimate acquaintances, other-
wise than as “Mr. Leathes” or “Leathes.” —
Yours sorrowfully, Charlton Park.
The S.A. Legislature has no sense of
humour. It keeps pegging away wearily at the
Commonwealth Bill and doesn’t even know that
the thing is dead. All the other provinces of
Australia have about forgotten the existence of
that Commonwealth Bill. Nobody cares for it
any more. Nobody takes any interest in it.
Hardly anybody even remembers that such a
thing ever existed. Barring G. H. Reid and
Bryan O’Loghlen no section of the community is
violently hostile to it, but then, no section of the
community is violently hostile to the planet
Jupiter either, and yet Jupiter doesn’t excite any
special interest all the same. The Commonwealth
Bill, and the millennium, and the Tichborne
claimant, are all in very much the same category.
Nobody could raise a passing enthusiasm about
any of them now—not even if he paid cash for it.
Premier Griffith was most struck in New
Guinea by the manner in which the Papuans
cultivate the soil. “In fact,” says Sir Samuel,
“they live on the land.” He saw on the coast
townships that contained 2000 inhabitants, all
apparently industrious and thriving. Wait till
the missionaries get a footing.
Says a recent American writer : “ There
is no truth in the assertion that the nigger will
yet dominate the whole of this country. We have
not had an honest negro census since the war, nor
are we likely to have one under political auspices.
The death-rate among the negroes is invariably
greater than among the whites in every town and
county in the South. The negro is more prolific,
because he marries early, and often regardless of
circumstances and ignoring the moral checks to
population which prevail with the white man.
With increased education and moral growth, he
will become less prolific. Even now his greater
birth-rate is over-balanced by a greater death-
rate. From the increasing immigration of whites
the surplus of negroes will ultimately be driven
into Mexico, the West Indies, or even over into
Africa, the natural habitat of the black man. ’

WARNER’S “SAFE” DIABETES CERE
the only preparation known permanently to
conquer both sweet and insipid Diabetes —
WARNER’S “safe” NERVINE,
an invaluable nerve Tonic, totally free from
opium or any preparation thereof, or any other
deleterious drug—most useful in instances of
nervous prostration arising from mental worry or
physical over-exertion — severe headache, in-
somnia, or sleeplessness &c., It possesses the
advantage of producing no re-actionary effects —
warner’s “safe” RHEUMATIC cure
for Lumbago, Sciatica, Gout, and all Rheumatic
affections—has cured numerous oases of long
standing—
WARNER’S “SAFE PILLS
are often necessary in conjunction with the above
Medicines, and are also to be taken for Indigestion,
Constipation, Diarrhcea, and Biliousness. As an
independent Family Pill, they are without a
rival, being purely vegetable in composition, and
mild, but effectual in action. They are already in
good repute with mothers—
WARNER’S “SAFE” PLASTERS
are Porous, Electrical, Counter-irritant, and Pain-
relieving to a high degree—suitable to every pain
that can afflict the human frame- are particularly
soothing and rapid in operation. May be applied
for Rheumatism, Lame-back, Lung-troubles, Con-
gested-liver, Stiff-joints, and Lumbago. Every
household should keep a box by them—
warner’s “safe” ASTHMA cure
gives instantaneous relief in the most distressing
paroxysms of spasmodic Asthma —is in powder
form to be burned and the fumes inhaled by the

warner’s TIPPECANOE.
What Warner’s “ Safe ” Cure is for the treatment
of diseased condition of the kidneys, Warner’s
Tippecanoe the Best—a, stomach tonic and in-

for Dyspepsia, Mal-assimilation, and Malaria.
Any person afflicted with Stomach derangement

Warner’s Tippecanoe, the best, in connection with
Warner’s Safe Pills and Safe cure, <prater and

Two absolute essentials for the existence
of the human race are—land and air. Many
economic and political systems have been invented
and are advocated for obtaining land for each
individual to live upon, but it has been left to the
Hydraulic Cooling and Ventilating Co. to intro-
duce pure air into every habitation in Australia,
by means of their “Perfection” Cooler and
Ventilator. By attaching this machine to your
water supply or tank, and simply turning on the
tap, a constant stream of pure, fresh air can be
obtained in any chamber you desire. Punkahs
are thus superseded, perishable goods can be kept
at a small expense without ice, and you can enjoy
the luxury of a cool chamber on the hottest day or
night. The machine, which is simplicity itself,
works at the cost of one half-penny per day, while
the price brings it within the reach of most.
Send for particulars or inspect the machines work-
ing in our offices. T. A. Knight and Co., St.
Janies Chambers, King-street, Sydney.

The Sydney Morning Herald special
oommissioner'insinuates that the junior bar is brief-
less chiefly because it isn’t fit to be trusted’ with
briefs. He says that if a junior possesses the
necessary elements that go to make a successful
advocate he rapidly progresses after his first case.
“Elements?” Why the plural? A barrister
can’t well have two fathers-in-law.
* * *
“Burke’s Colonial Gentry” only recalls
the proverb that one must go from home to hear
news. Burke displays much adroitness in sur-
mounting steep “pinches” and getting round
awkward corners on the mountain road of Aus-
tralian pedigree. For instance, he tells us that
the father of a potentate we all know was “a
civil engineer ” —the fact being that the ancient, a
decent old fellow, by the way, was a hard-working
blacksmith without any frills. And so on, right
through the volume.
James Tyson, junr., the unsavoury hero
of the Logan nullity of marriage case, has, it is
stated, settled £2OO a year for life upon his
quondam wife, and will, it is rumoured, shortly
enter into matrimonial bonds—legally, this time,
it is hoped—with a young governess in the Hay
district.
# * *
A Sydney junior barrister has become so
infatuated with Rev. Grubb’s teachings that he
now refuses, like Abe Lincoln, to hold briefs in
cases in which law is opposed to justice, and he
has followed this up by a new departure in legal
etiquette—namely, sending tracts with memos, of
his fees to solicitors.
* # *
That “private fortune” of Mrs. G. N,
Taylor, alleged to have been lost in her husband’s
land speculations, was a convenient family fiction,
seemingly. The “ heiress of West Indian ex-
traction ” hailed from Williamstown (Melbourne)
they say, and subsequent to her marriage with
Taylor she ran a little millinery shop in that un-
fashionable district—which would be scarcely the
cheese for a lady of vast wealth, anyway. It is
more than likely that she came into her property
about the time she started an overdraft at the Land
Credit Bank. Apropos —the wife of another very
big defaulter “ took in dressmaking at home ” not
so many years ago, so the evidence in these two
cases goes to prove that industrious wives choose
industrious husbands.

Here is an interesting story of the Ben-
jamin Trovato order :
Dear Bulletin, — Perhaps everybody doesn’t
know that away back in the forties Sir Henry Parkes was
employed at Regentville, N.S.W., at ten Bishop Smiths a
week and a single ration (viz., ten, ten, two, and a
quarter) to “ shoo ” cockatoos, parrots, and sich like
varmint off a corn-crop. Yet he was. But he didn’t
“ shoo ” much, for he used to borrow powder regularly
from my father (a native of that district) and “bang’’
it off at the birds periodically out of an old borrowed
‘‘Joe Manton,” thus scaring them and preserving his
voice and his legs in one and the same act, so to
speak. My father's powder, and the old borrowed
gun saved “Harry,” as he was then commonly
called, from running round and round the
paddock gesticulating and “ shoohooing,” an«f
gave him time while doing his work to the satisfac-
tion of his boss, who, by the way, was a “ nipper,” to lie
in his bunk and read books and newspapers, which he
did with a vengeance. My father told me that “ Harry ”
Parkes seldom “ shoohooed,” but when he did, his “ sboo-
hoo” was something awful, an assertion which, I venture
to think, few will doubt or deny. Painful and strange to
relate—and I am calling my departed father as a witness
—the appearance presented by “ Harry ” Parkes at that
time was neither handsome nor cleanly, neither dignified
nor statesmanlike. There is nothing funny about the
foregoing, except that it’s true.—Yours, H. J. Mao.

The South Melbourne Council once invited
tenders for certain works. The Treasurer, it was
said, used his influence on behalf of a tendering
friend. Some of the Councillors raised a virtuous
dust. “An officer to an important Council,” said
one indignant Councillor, “should be free from all
intrigues. The treasurer should respect himself
and his office —a person in his position should be
above suspicion.” The indignant one was Mr.
Matthias Larkin, and the upshot of his virtuous
opposition was the resignation of the Treasurer.
The day after Larkin had been admitted to bail
upon the first charge the ex-treasurer called to see
him. “Mr. Larkin is engaged,” said the door-
attendant, “ could he leave a message? ” “No,”
he wished to see him personally. “Was it very
particular?” “Yes, very particular.” After a
short absence the intermediary returned. “ Mr.
Larkin was very sorry, he was really too busy to
see anyone.” The ex-treasurer was grieved, but
“Never mind,” he added, “give him my name,
and tell him I called to congratulate him upon his

It begins to look as though “guinea-pig”
Manchester’s widow will never become Duchess of
Devonshire after all. Hartington was to have
married her several months ago, but he didn’t,
and now the death of his ducal progenitor will
put the ceremony outside the range of sassiety
politics for some time to come. Meanwhile old
age is creeping over Manchester’s “relic” (she
must be the senior of her faithful adherent, and
he’s sixty)' so if she should finally succeed in
worrying the new Duke of D. up to the scratch
she will find herself hopping feebly to the altar on
the leg that isn’t already in the grave. By the
way, it is noticeable that the lords of “highest
degree” and greatest family possessions have
little of the wealthy bourgeois ambition to leave
at least one legitimate son behind them. Distaste
for marriage under any circumstances runs in
several strains of deep cerulean gore, whilst the
present Devonshire’s possible sop to Hymen could
do no more for the next generation than that of
Lord Derby, when he endowed with his young
affections the Marquis of Salisbury’s mother.
* # «
Writes our English correspondent:—
“ Why has not the marriage of the Marquis of
Hartington and his innamorata, the Dowager
Duchess of Manchester, taken place before now ?”
everybody asks. It was announced for last May,
but the lovers are still two. The answer appears
to be that the old Duke of Devonshire (since
dead), to whom his son’s connection with the lady
has always been a matter of much grief, has posi-
tively “forbidden the banns.” He declares that
the marriage shall not take place with his consent.
He has not long to live, and what they may do
when he is entombed in the family mausoleum, he
cannot say, but whilst he lives he will veto the
match. He set his heart upon seeing the Marquis
have an heir, but that is manifestly impossible
even if he should marry the Duchess, unless the
laws of nature be specially abrogated in the
lady’s favour, for she is well on to the 50’s.
Hartington won’t marry any one else, so young
Victor Cavendish is the apple of his grandfather’s
eye. What a catch he will be? There was
nothing, after all, in his attentions to that Sydney
girl. A mere flirtation, that’s all. But still it
was playing with fire, for she is pretty, and if she
had half her mother’s tact and cleverness, she
might have landed the Devonshire millions.

Here is an heretical paragraph, sent to
The Bulletin by an Australee man who has
become acclimatised in England and has learned
to say “ haw ” quite naturally : —“ London is fast
cutting Paris out as the haven of rich Americans.
Only the very best come here, though, and the
American colony is composed of a great many
charming people whose accent is the only thing
against them. But this is nothing, for the Yankee
‘twang,’ as we are accustomed to call it, jars far
less upon English ears than the abominable Aus-
tralian tone of voice. This seems to grow worse
and worse every year, and really one almost
requires an interpreter when some of them speak ;
yet I doubt if you could find a Sydney girl to
admit that she did not speak with the most per-
fect English accent. The Dublin girls labour
under the same delusion, but in their case the
brogue is pretty, which is more than can be said
for the Australian twang.”

There are in London two new Bohemian
clubs which owe their existence to the financial
difficulties of the Savage—which difficulties, thanks
to Somers Vine and an energetic committee, have
been surmounted. These are the “ Wigwam ”
(purely and simply a dining club), which meets at
Simpson’s in the Strand, and the “Yorick,”
which has a location in Savoy-street, facing the
theatre of that name. This last club is going
ahead fast, and the committee are getting quite
’aughty, as regards admission. Old Sir James
Cockle, quondam Chief Justice of Bananaland,
who seceded from the Savage (of which he was
once president) when there was talk of a call to
clear off debts, is a regular attendant at the Wig-
wam dinners. He is a thorough Bohemian in his
instincts, and in the ancient days of the Savage,
before they moved to swagger quarters on Adelphi
Terrace, the old chap was a regular feature in the
smoking-room, ever puffing at his short black pipe,
reeking of Barrett’s twist, which he thinks the
only weed worth smoking,

Wanted, protection for the male sex. A
Tasmanian matron of 35, the mother of three
children, has sued a youth of under 19 for the
support of one infant, she alleging that he had
been her (unlawful) husband for a matter of three
and a-half years. Joseph’s case was that he had
been dodging the lady since she first started to
mash him as a boy of barely 15. After being
followed by the erotic female through all the'
boarding-houses of Hobart, the poor persecuted
youth took unto himself a male companion, and
started housekeeping on the mutual protection
principle, but the indefatigable woman planked
her trunk upon the threshold and announced that
she had come to stop. Joseph flew to his room
and looked the door. She demanded admittance,
and intimated that if not let in at the door, she
would break through the window. A compromise
seems to have been here effected, and to have
worked well, until the conquered Joseph heard of
the existence of Potiphar and the other three kids.
Then he rose in his wrath and bundled his wicked
seducer out. Revenge—a summons'for mainten-
ance. Denouement —virtue victorious-vice van-
quished—ease dismissed !

Primate Barry, predecessor of Primate
Saumarez-Smith, once exhorted a Sydney audience
never to give away money in promiscuous charity.
“I never give money in the street,” said his
reverence; and the other day we heard of a
Sydney clergyman, a well-paid saint and fat, who
had the Christian nerve to tell a deadbeat man, “ I
never administer relief at my—ah—private resi-
dence.” Bishop Smith’s quarrel with the Sydney
cabmen over his pound-of-horse-flesh is, like the
never-give-money-in-the-street doctrine of Dr.
Barry, a symptom of what may be called the
Englishising of Australian social manners. Eng-
land, for a broken man, is a cold, brutal, accursed
country. The hungry man goes into a London
shop, says he is dying of starvation, and asks in
the name of God for help. The shopkeeper “ sees
lots of his sort ” every day, and looks him
straight in the eye, just as a bullock-shooter
looks along his gun-barrel at the doomed
beast; “No, clear out, or I’ll give you
in charge.” If he happens to be a very
humane man he recommends him to the Charity
Organisation Society or the workhouse. In Eng-
land well-fed clergymen give miserable, wasted
people in charge for soliciting alms—yes, and
actually appear as witnesses against them at the
police-court. The Lord be praised for the fact
that the spirit of good-fellowship and genuine
hospitality born of the wild bush and digging
times has not yet been quite stamped out of Aus-
tralia by the imported formalists of later times —
that while there is a feed in the tucker-bag, or a
pannikin of tea in the billy, or a pipe of tobacco
in the pocket, part of it is at the service of the
stranger, of however low estate, who has just come
along and whom we may meet no more. We sup-
pose that, in the course of “civilisation,” a day
will come in Australia when the rich man, lay or
clerical, will wait expectantly on the footpath
until the cabman gets him sixpence change out of
his half-crown tender, and when, as in England,
people will drink by themselves in presence of
their friends, and will say when they are asked
for a few pence by some broken-down wretch,
“Ah, no, I will give you some bread and meat,
but I cannot give you money to spend in drink.”
When that day comes it will be time to find
another country. And yet that day is coming
along all the time.

Thus a correspondent:—
The old-time news-agency firm of Gordon and Gotch
has practically ceased to exist, although the new people
—trusted employes of the well-known house—trade under
the old names. The writer well remembers the founder
of the firm. “ Old Gordon,” as the boys called him
behind his back, was a big-framed Scotchman with a very
large nose, always surmounted by a pair of huge brass-
bound spectacles. He must have been 60 years of age
when I knew him first—in the fifties. In those days,
when the P. and O. boats arrived monthly in Mel-
bourne the old man would shoulder his sack, dis-
daining a coat, and hie him off to the ricketty wooden
building doing duty for a post-office, to take his chance
in the general scrambling for a first supply of the news-
parcels. It was a point of honour with each of us to get
his parcel first, if possible, so that our customers for the
Home News and the illustrateds, who were generally
waiting in crowds in our respective shops for the papers,
should be first served—the runners, always on the
alert for the agents having first supply, watching
with keen eyes who should be ahead, and pat-
ronising them accordingly. The Home News, which
then had a monopoly, was in those days sold at 18d.
“ Old Gordon ” having succeeded in getting his sack full,
would shoulder the lot and hump it off to the office in
Collins-street, opposite the Western Markets, repeating
the operation until he had obtained the whole
of the mail. The old man was slow but sure, as the
big business which he fathered can testify. There wasn’t
a boy amongst us who would not do the old man a good
turn if we could, for with a rough exterior, he had a
kindly and homely nature. There can be little doubt of
his status in the happy hunting-grounds.

The story goes that” a certain well-known

employment of that company as a peripatetic
agent, at a fixed salary of <£looo or £l5OO per

which brought his income up to close on £4OOO a

of the eyes and obtained six months leave of
absence. At the expiration of the time he applied
for a similar extension of leave, but the board
demurred. He pointed out his valuable services,

To fly with coloured sails ?

“What,” enquires a correspondent, “is
the subtle influence that leads embezzlers, on the
millionaire scale, to purchase magnificent libraries
and exult in gorgeous bindings? Larkin, of
South Melbourne, has his peerless library of
books on Australia, and Draper, the renowned
Commercial Bank (Melb.) defaulter of yore, had
his sumptuous library, in special morocco, and
naught wicked or frivolous, because he repre-
sented the Wesleyan interest in the bank. I have
read of the same peculiarity in famous English
defaulters.”

That the establishment of a Sydney Labour
Co-operative Store should, within a few months,
result in a charge of embezzling ,£2852 against the
manager, Andrew Fitzgerald, is a melancholy
example of how the workmen groan under the in-
capacity and worse of those who do business
for them. A queer fact in connection with the
police-court hearing of the case last week is that
everybody concerned was Irish, including the
prisoner, the Police-Magistrate, the prosecuting
and defending attorneys and the witnesses.

Prince George of
Wales has been ill of
late and consequently
there is a muffled note of
woe pervading the last
batch of British illus-
trated papers. There is
no grovel on earth like
unto the grovel of the
illustrated British papers.
The one point on which
they are all agreed is that
the working classes of
England are haggard
with'anxiety about George
of Wales, and can’t get a
sound night’s sleep for
thinking of him. They
toss about restlessly in
the hours of darkness,
and doze off fitfully, and
in their dreams they see
George of Wales with
his noble royal brow
furrowed with pain. And
then when the boards
creak or the furniture
groans mysteriously at
night, they start up in
alarm under the fear-
some conviction that
they can hear George
getting worse, and
they heave a long sigh
of thankfulness when
they realise that it is all
a delusion. The Daily
Gbaphio in particular
comes out strong with
a picture of a horny
son of toil standing out-
side a newspaper office,
his bag of tools on his
shoulder, and on his face
a look of suspense, like
the look of a hanged
workman at the end of
a rope. He has stopped
on his way home to
inquire if George is
better, and you can
see by his countenance
that if George isn’t better he will fall heavily,
in a dead-faint, on the pavement, or weep
against the nearest fixed object that pro-
mises to support a strong groveller in his agony.
Of course, he is a soul-blasting lie from first
to last. If he stopped there at all, he did it
because he was wondering whether he could
afford a ha’porth of shrimps for tea. If he ever
wore that look of agony, it was because he was
hungry and cold and exceedingly hard-up. He
didn’t care a straw for George of Wales; he
hardly even knew that there was any George ;
and it wouldn’t have concerned him in the least if
a house had fallen on the entire royal family, and
blotted them out. But the spirit of grovel has its
roots deep down in the illustrated paper, and
nothing will ever cure it till the statue of Albert
the Good drops on its head and flattens it out into
one unpleasant mass in front of the throne.

At Melbourne last week the blotchy bar-
nacles who attach themselves to cricket and are
humorously described as leading patrons of the
game, rose in a fat, unwholesome mass to protest
against the abolition of that four o’clock interval
for refreshments. W. G. Grace and brother
Britishers, not forgetting his ludship, have
been nobbled on this point by the guzzling
identities of the pavilion. The interval was only
scotched, not killed, by W.G., when he declined,
during his first innings on the Melbourne ground,
to recognise any necessity for stopping the show
in order to push the liquor-traffic. The dear old
boys of the booze brigade besought the English-
men not to interfere with any more adjourn-
ments—for the sake of the club caterer, you
know—and so the swipers of the ball gave
m to the swipers of the bar, and a good chance to
make cricket livelier was sacrificed on the altar of
Bacchus. Even the excuse of fatigue in the field
is dispensed with at times, as when on .Tuesday
afternoon (last week) the drink-bell tinkled after
minutes’ play, ten minutes of which had been
lost by the breaking of a bat-handle. The crowd
roared their disgust when the umpires and Aus-
trahans tripped off to the grog-shop, and Grace
hegitated a f* t before ]eaving his wicket . Ditto
Stoddart. They were both trying to make runs
against the clock, indeed, but as visitors, they
couldn’t encourage a row round the oval by setting
a decent example to their adversaries. They

Wrixon, the new Victorian knight, is the
man who married one of millionaire Miller’s
daughters, and passed a wretched little Bill for
preventing the publication in Victoria of Sunday
newspapers. For this latter service to the Grown

smug and godly lawyer gets his precious handle.
Or perhaps it is an official recognition of the wife’s
money, just as Fitzgibbon’s sop of O.M.G. is the
result of his having risen to notoriety by the grace
of another rich father-in-law, Mick Dawson. Is

profession than the law,” said Major Pendennis.
And Wrixon, who, by combining the two pro-
fessions, was able to walk into the billet of
Attorney-General on the strength of his “social
position,” ought to fall down upon his respectable
knees and sngjfle “Amen” to the majah.

Sir Salmon Wilson, says our correspon-

borough has still enormous social influence, and
she may be relied upon to push forward the
family to which her own has recently been allied.
At the Wilson-Churchill wedding Australians
were conspicuous by their absence, whilst Ameri-
cans were, on the country, as plentiful as black-
berries. The young couple are to have a big
allowance. Of course “Poppa” Wilson finds this,
for young Australians of ig—well, no, im-noble —
birth don’t marry Duke’s daughters every day,
and the luxury must be paid for.

Dear Bulletin, —There is a chap down
here who claims to be a nephew of Lord Salisbury.
He is a copra-trader, and taken all round is what
Artemus Ward would call an “amoosin’ cuss.”
Shortly before Christmas the trading-steamer
Croydon, on her trip round the islands, called in
at Salisbury’s nephew’s station to get copra. The
captain one morning waited on the English
Premier’s relative who assured him he couldn’t
do any trading as he had very important business
of a private nature on hand. The nature of the
private business transpired later on, in the after-
noon, when an apparition armed with a large knife
and with blackened legs, abbreviated loin-cloth,
and feathers in its head appeared on the' beach—
it was Salisbury’s nephew on his way to a native
“sing-sing” (i.e. corroboree). Late at night a big
fire was lighted on the hills, and with the aid of
glasses we saw the whole performance, Salisbury’s
nephew taking a leading part, dancing, howling,
and playing the goat generally. It is pretty hard,
don’t you think, that while old Salisbury is doing
his best to keep up the tone of the aristocracy “ at
home” his nephewshould be encouraging savages to
make angoras of themselves ?—D.B, Anietyum,
New Hebrides, 24th Dec., 1891.

In St. Kilda (Melb.) Cemetery may be
observed a flat, square tomb, the top slab of which
weighs a few hundred tons, or so. The gentle-
man inside was an R.C. who married a Protestant
lady, and the bereaved widow put him to rest
amongst other quiet people of her own particular
persuasion. The relatives of deceased, enraged at
this breach of faith, threatened to storm the bone-
yard and carry off their late lamented co-religionist
to a proper place where the blessed saints would
be able to keep an eye on him. But the widow
simply fixed up her treasure in a burglar-proof
sepulchre, as aforesaid, and defied the whole
Catholic Church to shift that lid. A future
resurrection is out of the question.

The London correspondent of the Argo-
naut pleads in excuse of Albert Victor: —“As
for his dullness he is not exactly to blame for that.
I do not think any disinterested person ever
accused the Prince of Wales of being brilliant,
and we all know how deficient in conversational
powers and accomplishments the Princess of
Wales is.” All of which is very shocking.
The Theatre Royal Hotel, Sydney, has
lately changed hands, and is now under entirely
new management. A splendid stock of wines,
spirits, liqueurs and cigars has been laid in, and
an altogether new feature is provided in the shape
of an American bar, where all the strange, curious
and refreshing drinks known in the United States
can be obtained. Their name is legion, but among
them may be mentioned champagne cocktails,
gin fizz, milk punch, mint julep—probably the
noblest liquor known to man —imperial punch,
Manhattan cocktails, and many others. All
mixed by American bar-keeps. James A. Walsh,
proprietor, late of the Occidental Hotel, San
Francisco.*
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills are suited to every age.
They are mild and pleasant in action, thorough
and searching in effect, and, being sugar-coated,
are easy to take. These Pills never fail to give
satisfaction.
Ayer’s Hair Vigor stimulates the hair to a
vigorous growth. It contains all that can be
supplied to make the hair beautiful and abundant,
removes dandruff, and renders the hair flexible
and glossy.
A BOON TO HUMANITY
Tis food for young and food for old,
It gives new life and vital power,
There’s nothing in the market sold
Like Pbmkll’s patent Show white Flour.
ANOTHER DISILLUSION.
Ye sods ! we mutely gnaw our nails,
We also blush and wince—
The world had represented Wales
As quite a brilliant Prince ;
Amongst the men of wisdom rare
His Highness has been starred —
’Twas rumoured that he lost his hair
Through thinking very hard.
It gave one joy to sit and preach
A sermon on his sense:
His royal after-dinner speech,
On paper, looked immense;
And when he laid a corner-stone,
Or opened “ homes ” and parks,
We always thought he stood alone
At making neat remarks.
And as for Bertie’s dear Princess—
The blushing Denmark Rose —
She seemed an angel (nothing less)
Prom bon ret crown to toes;
A poetess of high degree,
A “ gem ” to sing and paint.
Chock full of wit and repartee—
But now they say she ain’t.
Does Clarence come of parents dull—
O ! does his royal gore
Explain the texture of his skull
And make him such a bore ?|
Our legs collapse, our reason fails,
We slap our dizzy head :
We pray God Bless the Prince of Wales,
And tumble into bed.
Good, loyal subjects we were born,
And loyal we will die,
From morn till night, from night till morn
We bless the Monar-chy;
And though, perhaps, our future king
Is not exactly smart,
He’s bound to have (and that’s the thing)
A very gracious heart.

NV illifim '() Connor, of Sf. Leonard's Hill,
Daylesford (Vic.), wagered that ho could cut and
H{ilit 7 cords, or \"h tons, of sft. lengths firewood,
s!)ft. to the ton, in one day. He did it, it is
said, in 10 hours. In the first hour he cut and
split cords, or 3J tons, thus beating top record
(a Melbourne policeman’s) by 20 minutes in time
and a-half cord in wood. He filled a railway
truck, which holds 7 cords, and had one load to
spare. There were 14 drays to cart the load to
the station. Most worthy Gumsucker.
The Central Press Agency, Sydney, has
issued a taking little volume of well-printed stories
under the general title of “ Kamboola,” by the
“ Voyageur.” The book consists of twelve stories
and sketches which smack of the sod, and are
evidently the work of one who has travelled much
and often throughout the length and breadth of
Australia and Maoriland. They are for the
greater part the reminiscences of an up-country
bank-clerk, and one or two have strong dramatic
interest. The best of the series are “ Kamboola ”
and “ Meredith’s Manager,” though “ Mr.
Shillingsworth’s Speculation ” and “ The Story of
a Race ” run these pretty closely. The last sketch
in the book, “His Last Breakfast,” is so good
that we are sorry the author did not cultivate this
vein a little more. He is lacking somewhat in
literary technique, but he has a good “feel” for
strong dramatic incident, and with practice ought
to be a coining man. The main body of the little
volume is made-up of shark, crocodile and kanga-
roo hunting and racing experiences, but we do not
think that this is “ Yoyageur’s ” genuinely strong
and original work—and he is so promising in more
promising material that we await with something
like interest his next essay.
A HUMAN BENEFACTOR.
We consider that any man who devotes his time,
energy and money to alleviate human suffering, is
entitled to the gratitude and thanks of the nation.
There resides among us a comparatively young
man who deserves to' be publicly mentioned for his
wonderfully successful efforts in discovering the
many healing properties which have long been
believed to exist in Australian plants. Herr
Rassmussen, the celebrated Danish herbalist, is
the enthusiast we are referring to, and his name
as a medical wonder is familiar to all Australians.
He is practically qualified by the unanimous ver-
dict of the Australian press and people as a clever
and earnest medical practitioner. His credentials
are open for all to inspect. Herr Rassmussen’s
.‘■uccesses are not only genuine, but really wonder-
ful, and may well be envied by most of his
less successful medical brethren, and he is
in Australia what Koch is in Europe—
the very champion of medical discoveries.
He came to Sydney about 10 years ago a com-
paratively unknown man, and within such a short
space of. time he has literally climbed to the
highest step on the medical ladder, and is able to
hold his own to all-comers. He is the lucky
possessor of a magnificent gold medal, awarded
to him for some wonderful cures. His office con-
tains piles of genuine testimonials forwarded to
him by grateful cured patients, but not all for
publication, several of them sworn to before
magistrates, and there is hardly an Australian
journal of any importance which has not some
time or other referred to Herr Rassmussen’s
wonderful medical skill. He is entirely inde-
pendent of medical practice, and it is a well-
known fact that Herr Rassmussen is aiming more
at the welfare of his suffering fellow men than at
pecuniary benefits, and we hope that he will con-
tinue in his noble mission of lessening suffering
which he has been so successfully engaged in for
so many years, and he will not only immortalise
himself but reap the highest reward obtainable in
this world —the respect, thanks, and gratitude of
his fellow men.*

CORRESPONDENCE.
“EmJacey”: “An Old Man’s Story” is full
of vim and vigour, but lacking in technical workmanship.
The women of the very poor are not so often bought with
“gilded lies,” they are forced to sell themselves by
necessity. In writing a “ Socialistic ” poem it is always
well not to scream too much.... “ Will VV.” : “ Workers
arise !—arise in might and glory ” is bad for an opening
line ..." W.A.S.” (West Maitland); Your “Novel in five
volumes” could be boiled down into a sentence
“ T.V.0.0.” (Melbourne): “New Chum” trite in senti-
ment and bald in style; try again Hubert Y.” :
Good descriptive verse “ The Return of the Dreamers,”
but crowded with reminiscences of poetical reading. Why
not go for purely Australian scenery and incident and let
memories of old-world poets alone ? “ Christmas Night ”
is alike objectionable. It is, however, very good verse....
“Othello”: (1) If printed will be paid for; (2) you can
please yourself. .. “ Sweep ” : Thanks. But ’twould look
too much like a mere consultation puff “Nododo”:
Evidently a first-class libel, but will read “R.8.W.”;
Thanks “5.J.8.”: “Come, fill your glasses, mess-
mates,” is not digger lingo “R. Ford”: Letter for-
warded .., “ J.R.” (G.C.0.P.): Thanks “Ora”: We
are tired of descriptions of abandoned gold-fields. Like
the wattle-blossom and the dead bushman, the thing has
been overdone “Wai Rim”: Think it was The
Picayune, but forget date—years ago,...“Anti-Humbug”:
The Bulletin is not written for people of your kidney,
and we have no desire to please them. We would rather
die in a benevolent asylum than that. We are prepared
to respectfully consider all intelligent advice and criti-
cism, but we loathe and resent your unspeakable
ignorance. Edward M.”: What was it about?....
“ Mo” : The man too lazy or too incompetent to pass the
present N.S.W. test would make a sorry barrister...
“J.8.D.” (Monteagle): Many thanks; have written
“ Mao.” : Pah ! The Freetrade papers merely confine
their extracts to American papers subsidised by the
Democratic party and ignore the Republican newspapers,
which tell an exactly opposite tale. The Tory press here
never argues out a question on its local merits, even by
accident “ A.C.T.” (L. 0.): “Lost Tribes” is not bad,
but it is also not specially good, though the metre jogs
along respectably and rhymes are all right. “ A Frag-
ment” is leagues ahead of your first effort, but the senti-
ment is too slight to hang a poem on “ The Breaker”:
A. L. Gordon has written so much on the subject you
treat in “Night-fall,” and he has moreover done it so
well that further poetic remark on your part is superero-
gatory “Martin Turner” (II.): “Pastoral Poem” is
thin, and the versification thereof weak “ Wen-
dourie”; Thanks ...“Ah Ohee”: Address, please....

SPORTING NOTIONS.
“ All Australia ” succeeded last week in beating
Lord Sheffield’s Eleven by 54 runs, and the result has
been generally described as a glorious victory for the
local men. The fact that they won, on a wicket that wore
so well as to make the luck of the toss but a small cir-
cumstance in their favour, quite disposed of the theory
that Grace and Co. were a vastly superior team. All the
same, the Englishmen have good grounds for complaining
that the Australians played a dull, irritating game, with
less idea of winning on their own merits than of getting
the other men beaten anyhow. To start with, it was
understood that the match would be limited to the four
days it was advertised to last, and had the Australian
batting been regulated accordingly, the four days would
have more than sufficed. As things went, the English-
men (who had already knocked up the biggest innings
of the match in a few minutes less than a cricket
day, which is five hours, allowing for intervals) found
themselves going in again at 3.15 p.ra. on the fourth
day with 213 runs to make in (allowing for 4 o’clock
“ rest”) exactly 2J hours. There was a picnic “on” for
the next morning, so the Britishers, who are whales for
picnics, started to play a forcing game. That they might
have pottered through the afternoon with a loss of not
more than two or three wickets was as obvious as the
fact that they w'ere entitled to take the consequences of
risky slogging, They tried to punish the bowling with
the result that a fair portion of the two and a half hours
was lost in batsmen’s walking up to the wickets and
walking down again to the Pav. The superiority of the
Britishers as showmen for the crowd can be judged from
a few figures. They had no individual score as high as
Bruce’s, or bowler with an average as -low as Turner’s or
Macleod’s, yet their rate of run-getting distanced the
Australians. In Bhrs. 20min. of actual batting they made
54 runs less than the winning side made in exactly 13hrs.
After luncheon on the second day they made 240 runs,
whereas the Australians made 191 in the whole first day,
on the new, perfect wicket, and only 119 after luncheon
on the third day. Roughly speaking, the visitors were
alw’ays good for about 14 runs an hour more than the
Australians, a huge consideration for the people who pay
their shillings to see some fun. On Saturday afternoon
they hit 33 runs an hour faster than Bannerman and
partners did on Monday afternoon. Evidently, however,
the English team is not as good as was at first supposed,
and after seeing them knock balls into the air just when
safety hits were most necessary, one is disposed to think
that some of them can’t be cautious. Moreover, the old
bowlers had lost their dash.

W. G. Grace’s manners haven’t improved. He
went regularly amok in his rage over the Melbourne
defeat and grossly insulted a newspaper-man who asked
him in a civil way for information. W. G. thought, he
had a “soft thing” on hand. Years ago Grace, while
playing in Melbourne against a Victorian eleven, was in-
troduced to a well-known Sydney man who was to play in
the then forthcoming match between the Englishmen and
the Cornstalks, at Sydney. “ Ah,” said Grace snappishly,
“ we may have a bit of work over the Melbourne match,
but you fellows at Sydney we will lick in one innings.” It
so happened that the Sydneyites beat the Englishmen,
and that the man to whom, on making his acquaintance,
Grace rudely addressed the foregoing prophecy, was
batting when the winning hit was made. He reminded
the English captain of the prediction, but Grace had quite
forgotten all about it.
* * *
The fickleness of a crowd was never more
strongly demonstrated than during the intercolonial
cricket-match between N.S.W. and Victoria, and the suc-
ceeding match between the combined Australian Eleven
and Lord Sheffield’s team. In the former, Alick Banner-
man was hooted and reviled for letting oil-balls pass with-
out trying to hit them (the field being nearly all to the
off), and in the later event, cries of “ Good boy, Alick,”
and “Well let alone,” were shouted, and the English
tnmdlers were saluted with yells of “ Keep them on the
wicket ” and “ Bowl straight.” A few police sprinkled
among the average Victorian crowds at an important
cricket-match would go far toward checking filthy pro-
fanity.

known as Young Sandy, stepped into the ring, and took
the old man’s place. After a desperate battle Richardson
won on a foul, and thus beat father and son in the one
ring.

Thus London Truth
While the ladies—dear,, gentle souls—are canonizing
Mrs. Mavbriok for having very properly poisoned her
wretch of a husband, let us suggest that the men start
a subscription for Mr. Brierly. Mr. Brierly is the gentle-
man to whom Mrs. Maybrick wrote: “ I cannot answer
your letter fully to-day, my darling, but relieve your
mind of all fears of discovery now or in the future. He
is sick unto death. The doctors had a consultation

strength will hold out."
An Ideal Marriage.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
They had, long before they decided to join their
forces, met very frequently, at matinees, concerts,
and “first nights”—she as theatrical critic of
Pioallili, and he as representative of the Peanet.
They were both connoisseurs in sarcasm and
epicures in metaphor, and had been for months in
the habit of interchanging glances over pieces of
bad acting, and frowns when a note went wrong.
At last they were introduced. ’Twas at a
garden-party and she in conversation proved to be
even more piquant than her phrases, and as
brilliant as her paradoxes.
Under these circumstances there was very little
to do in the way of proposing. A very natural
desire to have some one about the place to read
one’s best copy to before sending it in, was common
to both of them, and held them together as Love
is supposed to hold the rest of mortals. Like
other purveyors of ink, they were both poor, and
presents during the engagement consisted mostly
of apt quotations and happy thoughts. They lent
each other adjectives as the London poor lend
flat-irons, both being marketable commodities.
One day—about the middle of the silly season—
there being little else to do, they married, and the
day afterwards continued their work as usual.
They took a cottage in Bayswater, joined the same
club (a cock-and-hen establishment in Albemarle-
street), and dined sometimes there, sometimes
with friends, rarely at home, and still more rarely
together. They had separate banking-accounts,
and when editors were unpunctual lent each other
sovereigns.
When first I met them they had been married
six months and I had known him a fortnight
before I discovered it; then it came upon me as a
wonderful revelation, for to all intents and pur-
poses Harry was a free-lance —going out and
coming in when lie liked, dining where it pleased
him best, and behaving for all the world as though
he was unencumbered.
He had promised me a copy of verses, and we
had strolled from the club down to his cottage for
them.
“I’m hanged! well I am hanged!!” he ex-
claimed as he closed the front door and seized a
silver-mounted umbrella in the stand; “ Jack’s
in, this is luck.” He examined the umbrella more
carefully. “By Jove, yes, that’s her’s.” Then he
went to the bottom of the stairs and shouted up :
“Jack, are you there?” And from above there
came the reply in the freshest of voices—“ Yes,
don’t go, Harry, I have a really good yarn for
you.”
“If it is not a rude question, who is Jack? ” I
asked as we settled ourselves in the dining-room.
“Jack,” he replied with eyebrows raised in
astonishment at all the world not knowing Jack—
“ Jack is ‘ Admetus ’ of Pioallili and my wife.
I’ll introduce you directly.”
As he spoke the door opened and she came in,
and putting out her hand welcomed her husband
heartily, wholesomely and without kisses. She
struck me as being the most glorious woman I had
ever seen ; her face was alight with real pleasure
at seeing Harry, And as she was leaning back
against and half sitting upon the table I wrote
her down in my own mind as quite the
queen among things natural. I was just
analysing her dress, which, by the way, was
of rough grey serge, short, and very plain, with a
hat of the same material, when, turning to me,
her husband said, “ I’m forgetting, let me intro-
duce ”
Then my turn came, and we sat down, heard
her good things (which were indeed good, but just
too racy to be publishable), exchanged gossip, had
tea, and rose to go. A.s we rose, she asked us
where we were dining. Hearing that we had no
engagement, she invited us to dine with her at an
Italian place in the Euston Road —up stairs—an
invitation we gladly accepted. And what a
dinner it was ! She, in quiet evening-dress, played
the part of both host and hostess, and played them
well. Me, she treated with the freedom I was
entitled to as Harry’s friend, and Harry, some-
times as a big hungry school-boy—then as a twin
brother, and again as a sympathetic fellow-
struggler in the field of letters. The conversation
never failed, for we had all been gleaning among
the wits, and had good things to tell, editors to
curse, and friends to laugh at.
At half-past nine she rose to go—“ I will be in
time for the last two acts,” she said, “and
business must be attended to.” Harry, all smiles
and although six months married still her sweet-
heart, rushed for her opera cloak and adjusted it
with the tenderness and care of one still in love.
And when the' wheels had died away he turned
suddenly to me and, as though conscious of my
thoughts, said : “I don’t mind it half as much as
I thought I should. ”
MANNINGTON CAFFYN.
Ellen Terry: Woman cannot be man’s
equal, because she is so much superior.
This sample of police ingenuity is a strange
contrast to the slow and bungling methods of the
bull-headed Anglo-Saxon “cop.” Last November
a headless and naked corpse was found in the
cellar of a vacant tenement house in the east end
of Paris. The clothes could not be traced, neither
could the missing head ; in fact there was no
evidence at all. There was apparently no place
even at which to begin an investigation ; to all
intents and purposes the dead man might as well
have been an unrecognisable corpse found floating
in the middle of the Pacific. But the locality was
one chiefly haunted by criminals, therefore there
was a fair chance that the deceased was a criminal.
If so, he could be identified by the record which
is kept of the measurements of every offender
who passes through the hands of the police. The
head being gone, its dimensions could not serve as
a guide, but the detectives took the height of the
deceased to the shoulders, the breadth of the
shoulders, the dimensions of the chest, the feet,
the fingers, and the outstretched arms, till at
last the headless, disfigured, naked object was
tracked down in the police records as a man named
Boutry. Then these same records put them on
the track of Boutry’s history and associates, and
these latter were shadowed and their past
history looked up, till within three days one
was found who had been in the dead man’s
company on the night of the murder.. He
was arrested, and by the same process of
measurement was identified as an old offender
travelling under an alias. Then some more
ancient records revealed his favourite haunts,
and buried near one of them the lost head was
discovered. Upon this the prisoner confessed.
The inflexible and seemingly omniscient police
machine had scared him into abject submission.
It seemed to know everything and to be every-
where, and he gave up just as a man might do
when he found himself helpless in the grasp of an
octonu^'jj^

Somebody upon whom the mantle of Bul-
wer Lytton, or the smock-frock of Edward Bel-
lamy, has not fallen sends us a Utopian romance
entitled “ Laws and H abits of People who live in
other Worlds.” This brochure is technically poor,
and humanly twaddlish. It has neither wealth of
incident, originality of imaginative power, nor
literary ability to recommend it. The narrative
upon which the transcendental experiences are
strung is childish and narnby-pambyish, and the
experiences themselves are a very miserable re-
chauffe of every fag-end of Utopian literature the
author has ever read, with a very decided weaken-
ing of effect in the process of re-telling. The
booklet is published by Hector Ross, Sydney.
Plodding wretchedly up and down Sydney
harbour, there is a little steamer that owns the
saddest, weirdest whistle ever heard by human
ears. On calm summer nights its soul-destroying
toot comes over the still waters like the cry of a
woman in her last agony, and when the air is
thick with the winter mist it has a harrowing
groan in it as if a broken-hearted mother had
thrown herself overboard with eleven children.
When that vessel blows its heartrending wail at
Circular Quay policemen often run long distances
to save some imaginary female who is being ill-
used down the street, and at midnight’s solemn
hour scared citizens hear it, and get out of bed
and look from the window for traces of some
’orrid deed on the footpath. It is a whistle whose
dreary cadences awake sad memories of home and
mother, and unless it is suppressed its note of
woe will end by driving somebody to an untimely
grave.
“ The New Evangel, according to Richard
Proctor, Christian Socialist,” is a religious contri-
bution, of Australian origin, to the Utopian and
socialistic literature of the day. It is neatly
printed by Dimmook, of Maitland (N.S.W.), but
there is no special reason in the world why it
should ever have been printed at all by anybody.
Mr. Proctor has found a mare’s- nest! He has
made the wonderfully original discovery that
Christianity means self-sacrifice, and he further
tells us in decently-written English that those who
are whole have no need of a physician. The
author is very much in earnest and means parti-
cularly well; but as everybody, from St. Paul to
Charles Kingsley, has said the same thing, and
said it a deal better, the booklet calls for no more
than a word in passing. By the way, Mr.
Proctor should look up Count Tolstoi’s “ What
to do !” He will find his position very much
more strongly stated in the gifted Russian’s work
than in his own well-meant little volume.
Dear Bulletin, — A discussion has been
started in the daily press about the failure of a
large proportion of the Sydney University under-
graduates to pass the first-year Arts examination.
One of the plucked students, apparently a woman,
writing in support of the contention that the
failure was the fault of the examination and not
of the examinees, argues that the fact of her pass-
ing the matriculation exam, proves that she is not
a fool, and that as she worked, on an average, 16
hours out of 24 for weeks preceding the last
examination, her being spun cannot be attributed
to indolence. Now, in the first place, you can’t
prove a negative in that off-hand way. In the
second place, the woman who habitually reads 16
hours out of the 24 and thinks she is fitting her-
self for examination, is one of the worst kinds of
fool. If she had spent twelve months at the
University without learning the distinction
between 6 hours intelligent work and 16 hours
stupid grind, she deserves to be plucked. The
person who can do 16 hours’ daily work for exam-
ination 'purposes, and do good work, does not
exist, or else he is a genius. And, genius or not,
he is a fool to do it. Bigger genius, bigger fool.—

THE BEALE PATENT
HIGH ARM SEWING MACHINES
Have, by their continued merits and the general
satisfaction they have invariably given, won the
first place in public esteem, and are on all sides
admitted to be the best and most useful sewing
machines in the market.
FOR USE IN THE HOUSEHOLD
The Beale Machine presents innumerable advant-
ages. Tlie mechanism and the adjustments are
perfect, while the working is most simple; and
the addition of all the most recent inventions and
improvements renders the manipulation of every-
thing connected with the machine a matter of
perfect ease. The result of this is, that with
ordinary care the machine will last for many
years, nothing can get out of order, and no time
is wasted in tiresome meddling with the parts.
It is a servant that will never grumble, never
rebel, never want nights out, willing even on
washing days. It only asks for a careful cleaning
now and then, a snug, dry corner and a little
genuine sewing machine oil. Any other oil will
make it sick, and dirt of all kind it abhors.
The Self-threading' Shuttle, of solid steel,
saves the trouble of threading by the end of the
cotton. It has an excellent tension, is strong and
simple.
The Bobbin Winder is a marvel of in-
genuity, winding and guiding the cotton by
itself, as evenly as upon the reel whence it came,
and stopping of its own accord when the bobbin
is full.
For all kinds of family sewing and fancy the
Beale Machine has the greatest capacity.
The Improved High Arm. A great de-
sideratum with ladies has been the raising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
sewn freely to pass underneath. This had to be
accomplished without increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonderful
ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all clicking
sounds having been obviated. As is well known,
a good test of the finish of any mechanism is its
silence when in rapid motion.
With the Wonderful Beale Machine,
whether for hand or foot use, you can hem any
width, make double seams or fells, braid stitch
with chenille, Berlin wool, or gold cord, and such
like fancy work ; you may make a pretty lace
stitch, tuck ever so finely, bind dresses, coats, or
carpets ; sew on trimmings without guiding, make
frilling, ruffling, or niching; quilt, weave your
own braid with any combination of colours and
stitch it on at the same time ; make thick, woollen
door-mats, embroidered antimacassars, window
curtains, and so forth ; you can easily and rapidly
perform the fashionable shirring or gathering so
popular for sleeves, bodies, or skirts of dresses
with an appliance supplied gratis ; lay the small
cords in hoods and stays ;do large cording; gather
with or without a band, and generally do all
kinds of straight sewing upon any material what-
ever. You can darn upon any woven goods, and
[do crewel-work. The Beale Patent will pass
from eight folds of tweed or twenty of calico to
two of thinnest muslin, or even mosquito-net or
tulle, without the operator changing needle,
cotton, stitch, or tension, and the fine material
will not be gathered in the slightest. You may
make jbutton and eyelet-holes, do over-casting,
make herring-bone stitch upon any materials.
This work is absolutely unique and can only be
accomplished upon the Beale Patent Machine.
Any of these performances will be shown at our
shops at any time. The Beale Patent makes
a lock-stitch, which cannot ravel, yet by a momen-
tary alteration the sewing can be done so as to
rip from end to end, if desired. This peculiarity
is sometimes useful when children’s clothes are
intended to be altered.
Nickel-plating. —In our climate the exposed
parts of the machine, and the applicances, need
to be protected from rust. We have, at consider-
able expense, added a handsomely nickeled wheel,
nickeled plates, screws, appliances, treadle-bar
and cones. Heightening the appearance, these
improvements also tend largely to preserve the
parts. This plating is imperishable.
A special feature of The Beale Machine is
that
ALL THE CABINET WORK
is made at our factory in Sydney from registered
designs, and of the choicest
AUSTRALIAN WOODS,
some of which are without doubt the most beauti-
ful in the world. Suitability to the climate is
thus insured, and we are enabled to offer a greater
variety of styles, most handsome in design and
conveniently fitted for all the requirements of a
lady’s work-table.
These machines can be inspected at any time at
our principal show-rooms in Sydney, or at any of
our suburban and country branch shops, or from
travellers who are continually visiting all parts.
All the machines may be had upon easy time-
payment, or for cash less three shillings in the
pound.

STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen :
Statutory Declaration.
. £< l> George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
t T EAN ®BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
ROW’S
DANDELION
BITTERS.
We recommed these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, in more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M R.C.S., England.
Port Adelade, October 30, 1886.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned :
“I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, bein<>-
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpected and wonderful effect and change
in my system, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment I have so unhappily ex-
perienced for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are affieted as I have
been may take advantage of them.
“ I remain, dear sirs,

~ cause which determines the mating
of individuals has a direct influence on the quality
of the human race. All artificial social induce
ments lor the mating of unsuitable individuals are
instruments for the multiplication of the unfit,
lo prove how detrimental our present social life
is to the human race, we have only to ask how
many of the marriages which take place would be
consummated if there were no social inducements,
no fear of public opinion, no regard for the law’
if there were no other inducement but the fact
that he is male and she female, and that they are
physiologically mated. How many who to-day
are not mated would under such a state come
together and propagate, and how many who to-
day propagate from other inducements than love
would no longer do so ? One great cause of
the rapid multiplication of the unfit over the fit,
is our false social system which places so many
obstacles to prevent the coming together of our
best men and women,”-Victoria C. Woodhull.

played between N.S.W. and Victoria, from the
first in 1850.
In London the other day a wife, 18 years
of age, sued her husband for maintenance. They
had been married about three months, and the
day after their marriage she had to pawn her
wedding-ring to procure food, the husband having
paid his last live shillings for the wedding-
ceremony. The ring, as it happened, had been
obtained on credit, and the hungry bride nearly
got arrested for pawning it. Her husband was
out of work when he got married, and had
remained out of it ever since. He was still out of
work when his wife sued him, and when the
magistrate ordered him to pay 10s. -a week he
replied sadly that he might as well go to gaol.
Then the bride asked with tears where she was to
go to if her husband got into quod, and she was
informed that she had better apply to the parish,
js marriage a failure? Yes.

DECLARED BEFORE A MAGISTRATE,
J.-5 TITOS. MUDIMAN, of 515 George Street, Sydney, in
the colony of New South Wales, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows :
Whereas, I suffered very severely from a very
troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so
much that I was quite unable to attend to my business—
that of a Merchant Tailor. I tried several Doctors and
many Remethes, but all of no avail. Whereas, I, as a
last hope obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s
PURELY HERBAL “ DENMARK UNI-
VERSAL PILLS,” which I hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare COMPLETELY CURED ME within a
few weeks, and although this is now over five years ago, I
have remained well ever since.
The DENMARK UNIVERSAL PILLS also cured
my wife, and I make this solemn declaration, conscientiously
believing the same to be true.

The Ballad of Mabel Clare.
An Australian story to he read and sung hereafter.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Ve children of the Land of Gold
I sing a song to you,
And if the jokes are somewhat old,
The main idea is new.
So, be it sung, by hut and tent,
Where tall the native grows ;
And understand, the song is meant
For singing thro’ the nose.
There dwelt a sound old cockatoo
On western hills far out —
Where ev’rything is green and blue.
Except, of course, in drought—
A crimson Anarchist was he,
Held other men in scorn,
Yet preach’d that ev’ry man was free,
And also “ekal born.”
He lived in his ancestral hut —
His missus was not there —
And there was no one with him bub
His daughter, Mabel Clare.
Her eyes and hair were like the sun ;
Her foot was like a mat;
Her cheeks a trifle overdone;
She was a democrat.
A manly independence born
Among the trees she had,
She treated womankind with scorn,
And often cursed her dad.
She hated swells and shining lights,
For she had seen a few,
And she believed in “ women’s rights ”
(She mostly got ’em, too).
A stranger at the neighb’ring run
Sojourned, the squatter’s guest,
He was unknown to anyone,
But like a swell was dress’d ;
He had an eyeglass to his eye,
A collar to his ears,
His feet were made to tread the sky.
His mouth was formed for sneers.
He wore the latest toggerie,
The loudest thing in ties—
’Twas generally reckoned he
Was something in disguise.
But who he was, or whence he came,
Was long unknown, except,
Unto the squatter, who the name
And noble secret kept.
And strolling in the noontide heat,
Beneath the “ blinding glare,”
This noble stranger chanced to meet
The radiant Mabel Clare.
She saw at once he was a swell—
According to her lights—
But, ah ! ’tis very sad to tell,
She met him oft of nights.
And, strolling through a moonlit gorge,
She chatted all the while
Of Ingersoll, and Henry George,
And Bradlaugh and Carlyle—
In short, he learned to love the girl,
And things went on like this,
Until he said he was an Earl,
And asked her to be his.
“ Oh, say no more, Lord Kawlinee,
Ob, say no more !” she said ;
“ Oh, say no more, Lord Kawlinee,
I wish that I was dead :
My head is in a hawful whirl,
The truth I dare not tell—
I am a democratic girl
And cannot wed a swell 1”
“ Oh love !” he cried, “ but you forget
That you are most unjust;
’Twas not my fault that I was set
Within the uppercrust.
Heed not the yarns the poets tell—
Oh, darling, do not doubt
A simple lord can love as well
As any rouseabout!
“For you I’ll give my fortune up,
I’ll go to work for you:
I’ll put the money in the cup
And drop the title, too.
Oh, fly with me ! Oh, fly with me !
Across the mountains blue—
Hoh, fly with me ! Oh, fly ivith me! ’’
That very night she flew.
They took the train and journeyed down
Across the range they sped—
Until they came to Sydney town,
Where shortly they Were wed.
And still upon the western wild
Admiring teamsters tell
How Mabel’s father cursed his child
For clearing with a swell.
“ What ails my bird this bridal night,”
Exclaimed Lord Kawlinee;
“ What ails my own this bridal night—
Oh. love, confide in me !”
“ Oh now,” she said, “ that I am yaws
You’ll let me weep—l must —
I did desert the people’s cause
To join the upper crust.”
O proudly smiled his lordship then—
His chimney-pot he floor’d—
“ Look up, my love, and smile again,
For I am not a lord !”
His eye glass from his eye he tore,
The dickey from his breast,
And turned and stood his bride before
A rouseabout—confess’d !
“Unknown I’ve loved you long,” he said,
And I have loved you true—
A-shearing in your guv’ner’s shed
I learned to worship you.
Ido not care for place or pelf, •
For now, ray love, I’m sure
That yon will love me for myself
And not because I’m poor.
“ To prove your love I spent my cheque
To buy this swell rig-out;
Bo fling your arms about my neck
For I’m a rouseabout!”
At first she gave a startled cry,
Then, safe from care’s alarms,
She sigh’d a soul-subduing sigh
And sank into his arms.
He pawned the togs and home he took
His bride in all her charms ;
The proud old cockatoo received
The pair with open arms.
And long they lived, the faithful bride,
The noble rouseabout —
And if she wasn’t satisfied
Bhe never let it out.

A sample of Swinburne’s prose from the
last Forum. It reminds one of A. G. Taylor :
Nor would it be as easy for the most magnanimous
mouse of a Oalabanic poeticule to write a ballad, a
roundel, or a virelai, after the noble fashion of Chaucer,
as to gabble at any length like a thing most brutish in
the blank and blatant jargon of epic or idyllic stultilo-
quenoe.
“ Herbert Spencer, ” remarks an American
writer, “ thinks women would enact pernicious
laws by reason of their narrowness, short-sighted-
ness, and impulsiveness; but this is just what men
do. See the legislation in the States, in the
British Parliament, and in the French Assembly.
The women organisations during the last quarter
of a century show as much order, breadth of
thought, and consistency as the same number of
organisations composed of men. Spencer repeats
the old argument drawn from women’s inability
to do military service ; but that argument would
exclude also the crippled and the diseased from
the right of suffrage. Suffrage is not based upon
ability to carry a musket. In war women render
service in a thousand ways. The risks of maternity
are greater than the risks of war, and a woman
goes down to the gates of death to give birth to
every child who becomes a soldier. The use of
old, worthless arguments by Herbert Spencer
would seem to indicate the encroachments of age
upon the greatest thinker of the century. He has
been too much of a closet philosopher, perhaps, to
deal with practical questions.”
THE PRINCE OF WALES SPEAKS ON
HEALTH.
In his able and timely remarks at the opening
of the International Congress of Hygiene, at St.
James’s Hall, London, August 10th, 1891, the
President, the Prince of Wales, said “ The
highest possible prosperity is when rich and poor
alike can do such useful work as they are fit for ,
and to this end it is essential that they should enjoy
the best possible health and vigor.
Very true, but how can the public health be
best promoted ? Clearly by such preventive
measures as the Congress meets to consider, and
by reliable remedies so long as certain diseases
continue to prevail.
We submit an example of the latter necessity in
the form of a statement which cannot fail to con-
vince the minds of all who may read it.

I, Margaret Morland, of Throstle Nest Farm,
Haya Park, near Knaresboro’, Yorkshire, do
solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :
“1 have suffered all my life from a weak
stomach, indigestion and liver complaint. I was
never properly well but always ailing and never
seemed to gain strength. I had a bad taste in the
mouth and a strange sinking feeling at the pit of
my stomach. I had always pain after eating, no
matter how simple the food was. My appetite
was poor and what little I ate did not seem to
give me strength. I had great pain at the chest
and sides and felt as if I was held or bound round
my waist. I was much troubled with sickness
and very often found no ease until I vomited all
the food I had taken. I felt low, weak, and de-
pressed, as if something was hanging over me. I
could not sleep at night, and got so bad that I
even dreaded going to bed, for I would lie awake
for hours together, and on rising in the morning I
felt more tired than when I went to bed. As
years went on I became a bad colour, my skin and
particularly the whites of my eyes were tinged of
a yellowish colour, and at times I was as yellow
as a sovereign. In August, 1880, my stomach
became very irritable and everything that I took
turned sour on my stomach, and I was constantly
vomiting a foul bitter fluid or gas. I took little
or no nourishment, and after each morsel of even
liquid food I strained and vomited as if my
poor inside would come out. The pain at
my heart now became so severe that I be-
came alarmed and sent for our doctor, who
attended me for ten or twelve weeks, but all the
medicine he gaveme did no good. The doctor
seemed puzzled with my complaint and changed
the medicine over and over again, but still I got
worse instead of better. At last I lost all faith in
physic and gave up taking it. Now better, now
worse, I continued until July, 1888, when my
kidneys became affected. I had dreadful pain in
the back and could not void my water. My skin
was dry a,nd hot, my lips parched and feverish.
After a time the water lodged so bad that I
thought I should have died. I grew weaker and
weaker every day, and felt that if a change did not
soon take place my condition would be critical, for
the pain was more than I could bear. I could not
even bide to lie in bed, and had to get out of bed and
walk about the room.- I took all kinds of medi-
cines, but nothing gave me more than temporary
relief, and I dragged on in this miserable state
until December, 1888, when Mr. Day, the chemist,
at Knaresboro’, sent me a book telling of a medi-
cine called Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup, and I
read of a case similar. to mine having been cured
by this medicine. 1 determined to try it, and
sent to Mr. Day and procured a large bottle of the
Syrup and commenced taking it. I soon began to
find relief, my food digested better, and gave me
strength, all pains in my back and sides left me.
I could now sleep better and gradually gained
strength every day, and by the time I had taken
a 4s. 6d. bottle I was better than ever I was in my
life, and by taking an occasional dose I have since
kept in good health. 1 may mention that I paid
over six pounds to one doctor and did not receive
any benefit whatever. I feel very grate‘ul for
the great benefit I have received from Seigel’s
Syrup, and I wish others to know of it. I have
recommended the medicine,to many people in this,
district with great benefit. My daughter, Mrs.
Ware, living at York, was cured of severe dys-
pepsia after every other means had failed. If by
publishing this statement others may be benefited
I shall be very glad, and I hereby give permission
to the proprietors of Seigel’s Syrup to make any
use they may think fit of this testimonial, and I
make this solemn declaration conscientiously be-
lieving the same to be true. By virtue of the
Provisions of the Statutory Declaration Act. 1835
(William IV. c. 62).
Declared before me at Leeds,
in the County of York, by
the said Margaret Morland,
on Monday, the 10th of-
- 1891.
(Signed) Alf. Cooke,
Mayor of Leeds. ,

Mr. William Morland, the husband of this lady,
is a farmer, well-known and highly respected. He
has lived on his present farm at Throstle Nest,
Haya Park, seventeen years, and in the district
all his life. He was present at Leeds when the
foregoing declaration by his wife was read, and
vouched for its accuracy and truth. Mrs. Mor-
land’s malady, indigestion and dyspepsia, is suf-
ficiently common and fatal to make it a duty to
give the widest publicity to any remedy that
will cure it. Hence our mention of the above
case in c®t»pectiQU,mth' the work of the society of
which His Royal Highness is President.
PEOPLE
WHO
CAN'T SLEEP
One of the most distressing of all complaints is
that technically known as insomnia. Those only
who have actually'experienced what it is to lie
awake through the long, dark hours of the night
vainly courting “nature’s soft nurse” by such
devices as taking tally of an imaginary flock of
sheep escaping a fence in single file, or endeavour-
ing to centre undivided attention upon the
monotonous tick of a clock, can form even the
meanest estimate of the mental suffering borne by
the victim of this cruel malady. A celebrated
doctor once speaking on the subject said : —“lf
you cannot sleep the probability is that it is
because your stomach is empty. Get up and eat
a biscuit or two and drink a glass of milk and go
back to bed ; then you will sleep. Beer is not so
good as milk, but a bite of some light food is
better than either.” The advice is good, but there
are other predisposing causes of sleeplessness,
besides.that of an empty stomach. There is the
sleeplessness that arises from a diseased mind —
the consciousness of a wrong action committed ;
as well as that which is the direct effect of bodily
suffering. The latter class of patients too often
have themselves to blame and are without excuse
in permitting their woes to be intensified and
increased, when instant relief from pain linked
with the natural accompaniment of refreshing
slumber may be secured by an intelligent use of
St. Jacobs Oil, the infallible remedy that has ever
been found “ the right thing in the right place.”
This marvellous oil is a sure antidote tp all pain
troubles, and the most stubborn case of neuralgia
or rheumatism is forced to yield before its magic
power.

England and Australia.
Dear Bulletin, —The last time I wrote you
it was to report on what seemed to me the
democratic -situation of the hour, and to pro-
phesy portentous things within the immediate
future. Well, in the last few months the
political peace-barometer all over Europe has
dropped with a run ; the dejection of the demo-
crats has passed into hope and activity, and
now the old war-scare spectre rises up once
more to the sound of silvery music, like the
ghost in the 4 4 Corsican Brothers. ” This is, you
may remember, exactly what I anticipated, and,
H p to date, I see no reason to doubt that the
rest of my prognostications may come true
within another six months, and certainly will
come true before another six years, or half six
years, are out. France is just now wildly
exultant over her 44 finding ” of her army again
at the late big manoeuvres, and the next fron-
tier 44 incident ” with Kaiser Wilhelm will be
a grave one. For the 44 war” which it may
cause will be but the prelude of the social trouble
to follow, and everyone knows it.
* # *
But what I want to write about on this occa-
sion is something quite different. It happened
that in the months of August, September, and
October Mr. Christie Murray, in the Con-
temporary, and myself, in the Fortnightly,
were let loose by the respective editors on the
subject of Australia and the Australians. True,
my first article was more especially devoted to
the Labour movement, the text in hand being
the recent Labour victory at the New South
Wales polls; but the whole six articles more or less
turned on the subject of the Australian people.
I have no intention, of course, of criticising the
criticism thus produced. That is for other
people to do ; on this occasion all I want
to say about the matter is that it has
afforded me, direetly and indirectly, a really
first-rate opportunity of seeing the facts of
a case which interests me profoundly. And
this case is the genuine and actual condition of
the English attitude towards Australia. The
pother made over my articles, and especially
over the first, has been the means of teaching
me more in three months in this matter than I
might have learned in three years. All sorts
and conditions of interesting and uninteresting
people have I seen, all of whom were fully arti-
culate to me, whether in praise, blame, enquiry,
exposition or abuse, concerning these things.
Politicians, editors, the rank and file of birth
and wealth, and the rank and file of neither —a
motley crowd—to all have I presented an atten-
tive ear ; and if I have not now a pretty clear
idea of what Australia has to expect at the
hands of British Tories, Liberals, Radicals and
Democrats, then I am much mistaken, which
is possibly the case, it being human to err,
* * *
Let me at once start away by announcing
that I fear less now than ever I did for Austra-
lia. At times I have feared a little : at times I
have feared a good deal. There are forces
arrayed here against all that, to me at least, is
best and most distinctive in Australia—all I
trust for, hope for, and love in her—which no
one but a fbol would under-estimate, let alone
ignore. English greed has fixed its basilisk eye
on the colonies of the Southern Hemisphere,
and with its adopted sister in iniquity, viz.,
English caste tyranny, hates the true Australia
to-day as steadily and severely as it hated the
true America of yesterday, the America of
1851—’65. The psean of exultation that, in
more or less suppressed form, went up here
from the press over the collapse of the Big
Strike is a thing I shall not readily forget,
Dominant England, which was for the slave-
owning American South yesterday, is for the
would-be slave-owning Australian Capitalism
to-day, and is almost as eager to give
“practical force” to its sentiments. Almost
as formidable as English greed and English
caste tyranny is English national, or rather
now it is called “Imperial ” cant, and this also
has the keenest interest in “ the colonies.” Any
estimate of the Anglo-Saxon race, which leaves
out its passionate and innate snobbishness,
recites the play of “ Hamlet ” without the part
of the Prince of Denmark. In other countries
clever and vigorous enemies have to be “ grati-
” i. n the sheer shape of legal tender, if
y° u wish to silence them or bring them to
a “ right way of thinking.” In England alone
bribery and corruption cost nothing. You wish
to capture a journalist who is really hurting
“ the classes ” by his attacks? Very well, get
Lord Tomnoddy to ask him to lunch, and, if he
s tiA resists, set a pretty countess or two upon
him, and the thing is done. The same system,
in a slightly varied form, ensures the subjection
and corruption of every Australian of political
influence or of wealth who comes to London.
* * , *
The best, the most self-respecting, hold out for
a few months. Not one, up to date, has been
able to stand a year of it. They Anglicised
the Anglophobe Lowell in about nine months,
and before he had passed from his post as
ambassador at St. James’, the poor wretch used
to fly into a temper if you called him an Ameri-
can ! The man who, after six months of any-
thing approaching London “ society ’’ life, takes
occasion to say calmly, “I am an Australian,”
lives with the honest man Diogenes is reported
to have run round after with a torch. He is a
phantasm—an ideality. It isn’t that every
Australian with a pile or a name who-
comes here is a hopeless snob. The reverse
is frequently the case. He begins by thinking
himself as good as lords and baronets Bind
“society” gentlemen (as good, no better), and
is quite prepared to be friendly and kind to all
of them. In a month or two he discovers
that nobody else shares his opinion. For a
few weeks he is angry and disgusted.
Then he succumbs like all the others, and
takes his “ society ” gentlemen and baronets
and fiords extremely seriously, that is to say, he
is servile, and spends his money lavishly for
them, swallowing the patronage and insolence
with which they pay him with an unctuous and
grateful grin. Americans have stuck out for a
high price, and have usually got it—at least
their rich girls have ; but then America has the
prestige and power of a big nationality behind
her, and that makes Americans persistently
take themselves just as seriously as other people,
and in the long run it. makes them accepted
almost on their own terms. It is bluff for bluff,
and the American bluff, when backed with the
mighty dollar, is the better and stronger. I
would not trust any living Australian politician
or Australian man of money, with regard to his
true loyalty to his own land, after twelve
months’ residence in London, and, for nine out
of ten of them, three months will suffice to make
them nothing but the tools, unconscious it may
be, but none the less the tools, the abject tools,
of the English governing classes. The day will
come in which this will be put to a terrible test
—terrible, I mean, for Australia. Let her be
warned in time. What vitally concerns Aus-
tralia as a nation must be decided on Australian
soil. Englishmen can trust English ambassadors,
because England has a long past national his-
tory and a sort of national policy which all in-
stinctively recognise and act on, and, besides,
her ambassadors are by birth and training and
generally by fortune, above, or at any rate
on a level with social and monetary in-
fluence. Australians must send as ambas-
sadors men on whom social influence can be
worked with the greatest ease. The
Colonial Conference ended in one of the most
barefaced swindles ever worked by one com-
munity on another, and it is, of course, humor-
ously regarded here as such by all those who
know anything of what really took place.
England palmed off her old guns and tenth-rate
war-ships on innocent and 44 loyal ” Australia,
and then she extorted a pledge from her infant,
to support a worthless fleet which was to
defend 44 Australian ” shipping, 93 per cent,
of which is owned in England ! And how did
England do it ? She did it by social influence.
She petted a little gang of Anglo-Australian
politicians, or (in the English phrase) 44 no-
bodies,” in her London 44 Society” drawing-
rooms, till the poor fellows didn’t know whether
they were standing on their heads or their,
heels, talking to 44 real live lords,” and flirting
with 44 real live ladies,” and were ready, in
their fervent 44 loyalty” to 44 the Empire,” to
do just anything they were asked to do.
* * *
So much for the danger of diplomatic
treachery, a danger very real and very serious'
for Australia in the immediate future, and all
the more so because it is unknown to 99 Aus-
tralians out of TOO. and only vaguely suspected
by the remaining one. For the more direct
dangers—those of commercial greed and caste
tyranny—Anstralia is naturally better pre-
pared. The absolute instinct of self-preserva-
tion is affected here, and Australian Commerce
and Australian Labour can be expected to look
a little after their own concerns. At the same
time, it should never be forgotten that the
danger, when it comes, will come first of all in
a concealed shape. It is just like 44 the advance
of Civilisation;” First, the missionary to
quiet the irreconcilable temper of the free
savage. Then the trader to exploit him.
Then the soldier to crush out his angry revolt,
and then the full flood-tide of Civilisation itself
to sweep him out of existence. First the cant
of Imperialism, “ the silken bonds,” 44 the
union of hearts,” and all the tinsel sentiment
that catches the simple. Then the committal
to the support of ‘ 4 Imperial ” armed forces,
naval and military, nominally to defend, but
always under the thumb of faT-off central
authority. Then the corruption of the traitor-
ous upper-class, which prefers its pound of
flesh of privilege, whether of wealth or social
privilege, to the common rights and liberties of
all. Then the armed tyranny of subsidised
legions over the people that subsidised them —
the eagle killed with the arrow its own plume
feathered, and then (may the shameful sun
never look on the sight !) the swoop of the
birds and beasts of prey into the dead and dis-
membered carcase.
* * #
Is this future inevitable ? I trust no !
Is it probable ? I hope no ! Is it possible ?
I cannot but say, yes ! But what may,
and shall, prevent it? English commercial
greed, joined with English caste tyranny,
and wielding the sword of English Imperialistic
cant and armed force, what shall save Aus-
tralia from them ?—the English Democracy ?
God knows ! I do not nowadays trust the
English Democracy so much as I might or used
to do in a question where only justice and
righteousness can be shown on the one side,
and where self-interest and the power of
plunder can only too readily be shown
on the other. The Australian Demo-
cracy ? All that I love and hope for, and
trust in with all my heart and all my mihd,
with all my soul and with all my strength. It
is the one great human thing which I have
known for years in this weary world of
disillusionment and disgust and despair,
and yet never doubted of its essential good-
ness—whose faults and limitations are as clear
to me as daylight, and yet they never did any-
thing but increase my central love and hope and
trust in the splendid virtues and intentions,
which make Australia to-day the banner-bearer
of the world’s aspiration towards the brighter
future. The Australian Democracy will save
Australia to-morrow as the American Demo-
cracy saved America yesterday in ’6l-’65, and,
if needs be, as it did with blood and iron,
with fire and lead. But to that bitter pass of
darkness and death, I pray the nation I love
may never come. For there is a potent pre-
server in the road to it, and that potent pre-
server from English greed and tyranny and
cant is just this— English stupidity.
* * #
Look! The cards are already on the table where
English stupidity has flung, them. Here is a
king. It is India. We know what England
has done with India, from the point of view of
empire, religion, commerce ! We know Eng-
lish Freetrade has crushed the nations there as
English legions never did or could. Well, next
here is a queen. It is Ireland. The history of
Irish industry you know, as well as Irish social
and religious and military history. And lastly,
here is an ace. This is the present attitude of

England towards Australia, This is the tacit
conspiracy of her political and social leaders to
lie impudently to the world of all things Aus-
tralian, and this is the tacit conspiracy of her
press to burke all protests. Nowhere shall the
Australian get a hearing. A tenth-rate aspirant
to politics, a brainless young lord, shall send
“ home ” his shallow disingenuous report, say-
ing that the Australian tropics can only be
developed by servile labour. Globe-trotting
lords and capitalists shall rise everywhere to
corroborate the latest re-statement of their
ancient lie. At Institutes ex-Governors, rich
Anglo-Australian sycophants and all the crew
of greedy mediocrities that follow in their train
shall out-echo echo over the text laid down for
them by their leaders. Nowhere shall a voice
of protest be allowed : nowhere even a moderate
word of explanation of how all this seems to the
Australian democracy shall be listened to.
Either pander to the “ Imperialistic” sentiment,
rampantly current at the hour, or be silent.
That is the dictum of Press and Platform alike.
* * #
It makes one laugh. How they are overdoing
it! How they are playing into the hands of
their opponents ! If they only will keep on like
this for a few more years, these “ Imperialising
propagandists,” they will leave no choice, even
to the most moderate Australian, of being any-
thing but a traitor or a patriot. Either an out-
and-out patriot or an out-and-out traitor.
Nothing between. It is like America in 1776.
Even Washington and Franklin had to see
there was nothing to do but fight. The
terms these men proclaim and proffer are such
that even Mr. Armytage, the Victorian M.L.A.,
who would sooner be in hell than in an Austra-
lian'Republic, will have to hesitate to accept
them for fear they should act like an emetic.
Even a Victorian Armytage can’t swallow
everything. At times, I say, I have feared a
little for Australia : at times I have feared even
a good deal. Now I fear less than ever I did.
And why ? Because, my friends, I realize at
last, and to the full, the stupidity of England.
It is Australia’s buckler, her very sure defence
in the future time of trouble—the absolute,
sheer, prodigious, incommensurable, superhuman
stupidity of England.—Truly yours,
London, Nov. 14. ~

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was in the hard, hard times of the first of the
seventies. Station property was down, down, away
in the bottomless abyss, and sheep came into the
world only to be cursed as white elephants. The
alleged owner of the station, whereon I was a
lately emancipated jackeroo, had gone down to
Sydney to face the inevitable music in the bank
“ sweating-room,” and I was installed in charge,
with a rebellious cook whose wages had not been
paid for six months, several mutinous shepherds,
and a nearly empty store. I prayed hourly that
the long - expected man from the Queensland
Smashemall Bank would put in an appearance,
and take things off my hands ; to further which
consummation I would willingly have forfeited
the problematical cheque due to me for salary.
As I have just stated, it was in the days when
there were shepherds in the land, and amongst
the crowd who were bringing me to a premature
old age, or a lonely grave, were two old fellows
whose good deeds compensated for much of the
contumely I had to undergo. If I had possessed
any personal estate I would gladly have paid
Wooden Bob and Cranky Rob their long-overdue
wages out of my own pocket. But I had not got
a sov., so they received nothing but the blessing of
a harassed jackeroo.
Both were old men, unequalled shepherds, and,
strangest fact of all, never growled. They lived
together in a hut eight miles down the river, and
between them looked after as many sheep as any
four of the other crawlers put together. Wooden
Bob was as deaf as a post, and Cranky Rob as
mad as a March hare. Bob’s weakness was
tobacco and newspapers ; his pipe was never out
of his mouth, and all he wanted beside was, that
all the papers that came to the station should be
kept for him —and he solemnly read every word
they contained. Cranky Rob never read a line,
but he was an inspired naturalist. He could
tame and turn into a pet any living thing; the
hut was a menagerie; but, strange to say, money
would not induce him to part with one of his
dumb playmates ; and the currently received idea
of his insanity prevented anvone" risking inter-
fering with him. Not that Rob had ever shown
any dangerous symptoms, but men with a bee in
their bonnets are always best left alone.
Rob and Bob were the firmest friends, although
they scarcely ever exchanged a word. One fed
his flock up the river, and one down. If they
crossed, then they reversed the order.
. One night I was trying to forget ray troubles—
including the now openly defiant cook, who
gave notice and requested his gory cheque every
meal-time in a broken sleep, when someone
roused me by shaking me by the shoulders. I
started up, the moonlight flooded the room, and I
saw to my surprise it was Cranky Rob.
“Bob’s sick, I’m afraid he’s dying.”
I got out of bed and commenced dressing,
“ What’s up with him ? ” I asked.
“ Griping pains and cramps,” he replied.
“ Bring something with you,” he continued,
and without another word left the room and
started walking back to his hut.
It was all very well to say “bring something,”
but there was nothing to bring. I had a bottle of
chlorodyne, and there was some “ pain-killer ” in
the store. After catching the old horse we kept
for bringing up the cows in the morning I started,
armed with the restoratives in question.
Rob was before me, although I had not
dawdled ; he was sitting by poor old Bob, who
looked like a corpse. I gave him a dose of
chlorodyne straight away and it seemed to ease
him. I told Kob to turn in and I would
sit by Bob, who seemed a little better. Rob
lay down on his bunk, I drew a block up to
the rude table and tried to read one of the papers
by the flickering slush-lamp.
It was most uncanny ; all the nocturnal animals
amongst Rob’s pets were out on the loose and
evidently regarded me in the light of a play-
fellow. A ring-tailed ’possum had established
himself on one shoulder and a native bear on the
other, and they were holding converse across my
head. I couldn’t understand their language, but
I should say that each was inciting the other to a
breach of the peace.
Old Bob’s pains recommenced ; I dislodged my
visitors and gave him another dose of the seda-
tive, then resumed my seat, but the two did not
come back—a most unpleasant individual came
instead. A black snake, to my intense terror,
came swiftly across the mud floor, glided up the
leg of the table, and reared up looking me full in
the face. 0, those horrible, evil eyes ! The
sharp-fanged, cruel jaws that menaced me, and
the greedy, wavering, forked tongue. I tried to
call Rob, to persuade myself that the thing was
harmless, but I was spell-bound and could not
move.
I sat there in agony for what seemed hours, but
in reality were only minutes; then I heard a
movement in Rob’s bunk and an exclamation.
“What’s this?” he said in a tone of astonish-
ment, and I noticed that his voice was changed.
“ Princess Jezebel, out of bed at this time ! So,
old beauty, what’s he been doing ?”
I tried to tell him to take the thing away, for
those glittering eyes that held my will enchained
told me that if I moved I would be bitten. I
could not find my voice and the madman rambled
on.
“Watch him, old dame; not a stir or a move
out of him. I’m going out in the jolly moonlight:
the full moon that I love so. Watch him, cat;
don’t let him move,” and he strode out of the
door. As he went, he gave a low, melodious call,
and by the noise that ensued I guessed that all his
pets had hastened to join him, all but Princess
Jezebel, and she watched me, coiled for a spring.
. If I stirred a finger, the wicked eyes glittered
like fire. I could scarcely breathe, and to add to
it all Bob began groaning again, and I could not
go to his relief. I made an effort to call out, for
Bob was now groaning violently, and I forgot his
deafness. I thought he might withdraw her
attention ; but no, the wicked tongue seemed to
lick the cruel lips, as though eager to poison my
blood ; and I could not find my voice.
. May my worst enemy never suffer what I did,
sitting there fascinated by the venomous brute,
and listening to poor Bob writhing in agony ! A
thousand years passed, before I heard a footstep
approaching the hut, a skurrying noise, and the
’possum climbed up my stiffened limbs and
perched on my shoulder.
“Princess Jezebel, go to bed ! ” said Rob, as he
held out his hand, and the loathsome reptile
wound itself round his wrist and arm, and he
walked over to the box where she slept and she
slipped into it.
I sprang up and gave Bob a strong dose of the
sedative, then I turned on Rob.
He was sitting on the edge of his bunk, clad
only in his scanty shirt, just as he had walked out
in the moonlight; regarding me with mild com-
placency.
“Better?” he asked.
“Yes,” I said, remembering that he was not
responsible, “Can you sit up with him now?”
He nodded and came over; and I threw myself on
his bunk, and after fighting hard against it went
off into a half faint.
Bob was well in the morning ; he had cut him-
self with the knife he had used for putting soma
poison into baits, and inoculated himself. I
believe the chlorodyne cured him.
The man sent up in charge by the Smashemall
Bank turned up when I got back to the station,
and I gladly gave up my position as deputy,
manager.
Before I left I had an interview with Wooden
Bob, who considered I had saved his life. He told
me that Rob was always bad at full moon, but
the walk to the station and back under the bright
heavens must have made him worse. As for
Princess Jezebel, she was a cantankerous slut,
and, he believed, would bite, but then, he was
used to her.
I met the late alleged manager down in Sydney,
and he said, “By Jove, old man, they took it out
of you—you look ten years older.” I wonder I
didn’t look a thousand.

“Five hundred children under ten years
of age were taken into custody last year in London
as drunk and incapable.” Christie Murray, please
note.
Dear Bulletin, —The investing public is
an ass and totally unable to appreciate the mode
of construction of ordinary balance-sheets. Most, if
not all, of the recently-suspended Melbourne institu-
tions have, large assets consisting of loans on mort-
gage, reserve-funds, &c., but the fact that all such
funds are locked up in real estate is overlooked.
There are 17,000 vacant houses within a radius
of 10 miles of Melbourne, and the great majority
are the property of building societies, banks, &c.,
into whose hands they have fallen by default of
mortgagors. One society, almost the last to
stumble, owns nearly 800 tenements, the great
bulk of which are untenanted, and almost
unfit for habitation. Some of the properties on
which it lent =£1200 each are let on terms from one
to three years at annual rentals of £45 ! Deduct
taxes and percentage for depreciation, and
what is the return of interest on the in-
vestment? The great mistake was, and is,
in _ building societies lending to speculative
builders. Legitimate building society (indus-
trial) business is all right, but “ spec.”
building loans will wreck any society. The real
cause of the Commercial Bank putting on the
screw was probably the announcement by Premier
Munro that the Victorian ten-million loan would
not be proceeded with, and the certainty that
heavy shipments of gold to London to pay interest
will be necessary during the first quarter of ’92.
Watch the next few mail-steamers, see what the
associated Banks send to the “world’s money
mart,” and_judge if my contention is right. There
is a black time in store for those same depositors
when the term of forbearance expires, unless some-
thing very strange should happen.—Yours, G.H.

‘ Jim ” Carroll, the well-known Sydney
Police Court attorney, was once defending a pub-

“ Does your worship really believe that my client
was guilty of the grave offence of selling beer to a
small boy in a bottle ? ” Case dismissed.
The just-published “annals” of Bishop
Wordsworth, aged 85, are calculated to make the
hierarchy sit up. Some of them are in the form
of poetry, and the most surprising poem of the lot
is an apostrophe to a partially-dressed girl looking
out of her bedroom window early in the morning.
Another is a wild and fervent address to Polly, in
24 verses, two of which go thus -
And when you fain would shrink, Mary,
From me—I look and think, Mary,
There’s naught for you
I would not dr t
/ Should you but omy wink, Mary.

Thy simple look meanwhile, Mary,
To soothe me, or beguile, Mary,

To see thee is to smile, Mary.
The poor old sacred spectre publishes this in all
good fafth, and plainly enjoys it.
The Canterbury (M.L.) Times thus sums
up the ancient S.M. Herald :—
The most casual glance over the Sydney Morning
Herald must amaze any stranger who sees that great
newspaper for the first time. If one places the London
Times beside it and compares the papers, one is forced to
the startling conclusion that of the two the Herald must
be the better property. Nothing more perfect in the
way of a newspaper is turned out of any city in the
world. And, as far as mere news and advertisements
(about which there is no “mereness” anywhere) go, the
Herald is simply perfection. It neither leads nor follows
public opinion, however ; and I never see it quoted as an
authority or otherwise on any controversial matter. It
serves up dally three or four columns of the most respect-
able leading articles without backbone, or a particle of
any other sort of bone, reminding one of the tables
spread daily in some great hotels for guests who never
come—for no one reads these articles or cares twopence
about them. The people of Sydney call the Herald
“Granny”—and bring all their advertisements there all
the same. I don’t know why they call the paper
“Granny,” for the Herald articles are not at all womanish
and yet are not manly ; they seem to be written by
creatures more manly than women, and not so manly as
men. Namby Pamby lives in the office, and sits every
day in the editorial chair, with milk and water in the
sub-offices. I never knew anybody who really valued, or
loved, or liked, or disliked, or even respected Namby
Pamby, or milk and water. No doubt their tone is always
decent, and their English is not bad.
From the Muttaburra (W.Q.). there dis-
appeared by night a well-known horse belonging
to a neighbouring station, and the thief had the
audacity to ride it through the township. This
Was no ordinary case with which a mere police
sergeant or trooper could deal. So, adopting the
rdle of a shearer with the usual soiled moles, loud-
coloured Crimean, and dilapidated soft felt hat,
the dashing and astute inspector set out on an
ancient “crock,” with a saddle to match, and
leading an equally worn-out pack-horse. At
Tablederry the pursuer overtook the thief, camped
for dinner close by a waterhole, with the stolen
horse hobbled out. This was not quite enough
for the inspector, who, to make a “case,” required
to catch the thief with the horse in his possession,
and so he rode up to the camp bidding his mark
“Good-day,” just mentioned in a casual sort of
way that he too thought he would have a “ snack,”
unsaddled, boiled his ancient quart-pot, andmadea
few general observations on the shearing prospects
and the coming season. Our horse-stealer dropped
a hint that there was not a “ full board ” at Rook-
wood station, and that he was bound thither,
whereupon, of course, the zealous officer agreed to
try his luck there top. Dinner over, he caught
his horse, saddled up, and waited. But the thief
tolled his swag, and when ready threw it over his
shoulder, and went along. “Eh, halloa ! ain’t
you going to take your horse?” Called the inspec-
tor, who here felt “ violently shook up. “ Horse ?
No.” “Whose saddle is this, then?” “Oh, T
don’t know. It was there when I came,” replied
the honest shearer, “good day, mister.” Said
the inspector when telling the story afterwards :
“ Begorra, he was a hard case. You see he must
have knowed me from the jump.”—Townsville
Bulletin.
In spite of the tremendous efforts of the
British press to hush up the suicide of Lydia
Mantoli, the Gaiety girl who died for the sake of
a prince, things are growing unpleasant for that
pale and fish-like scion. Lydia Manton suicided
in a horribly clumsy and agonising manner, with
carbolic acid ; and she left two letters behind her
which were duly suppressed. The inquest was
held with closed doors, the reporters’ notes were
bought up with many sovereigns, and the coroner
declined to supply any information to the press.
But Lord Charles Montagu, an impecunious
hanger-on of royalty, stated that he knew the
deceased in a strictly honourable and platonic
way, and that she suicided simply because he had
promised to lunch with her and didn’t come —
which seemed a painfully thin explanation. This
story fell through. Lydia Manton was cheap
chorus girl who wore dresses valued at .£250, and
died with a rope of pearls round her neck, and
several hundred pounds worth of diamonds on
her taper fingers. She had a pony trap, an
elegant house, five servants, and a large bank-
account—none of which came from Lord Charles
Montagu, who can barely raise enough money to
ge;t his Waterbary repaired. The dreary Prince
used to spend most of his time behind the Gaiety
scenes, and was known to everybody, right down
to the scene-shifter and the limelight artist, as
Lydia’s protector ; he haunted watering-places
incoij. along with her ; and he was known to most
of Lydia’s friends, and apparently had many high
old times among them without the slightest
disguise. Then his agonised father—having
the fear of Stead’s all-seeing optic upon
him — interfered, and abducted his son by
violence. That miserable spectre promised to
have one last farewell lunch with his lost love,
and to rest his pear-shaped cranium on her
shoulder before parting, but he didn’t come.
Montagu came instead with a badly-composed
apology, and fled in haste because Lydia showed
signs of dashing furniture at him ; and when he
was gone the distracted and harried female banged
things about for a while, and then swallowed
enough carbolic acid to poison a camel, and died.
When the alleged inquest was over, and the row'
began in the press, the “ loyal” papers solemnly
asserted that the coroner’s sole reason for lying
low was that he wanted to spare the feelings of
Lord Charles Montagu, who had inadvertently
driven a wealthy chorus-girl to suicide by break-
ing a lunch engagement. But Montagu is only
the stone-broke younger brother of “ Uncle Kim,”
Duke of Manchester, and no coroner ever put
himself into such a tight place for the sake of a
younger brother.

GOLDEN SPECIFIC CO.
145 & 147 Collins St., MELBOURNE, VIo, 1
In years gone by an engagement on the
parliamentary staff of a certain big paper was
regarded as the blue-ribbon of an Australian
pressman’s life. Of recent years, for some in-
rcrutable reason, that journal has not attracted
first-class pressmen. Perhaps it is because there
are too many “bosses,” or perhaps it is because
the machine-like system of the opinionless paper
spoils the style, and necessarily the marketable
value of good men. In the orthodox old days, the
day-editor flaunted a list of applicants as long as
his arm in the face of an applicant; and pretended
that good men could be got easily for the asking.
But, in these days of competition and heterodoxy,
the paper has to snap at men of even mediocre
ability and astuteness.
John James Rainbow Bignell, who was
found drowned at Yarra Flats, not far from
Melbourne, a little while back, wafts to memory as
a leading man in the atrocious scandal of Fisher,
the “Nunawading Messiah.” Fisher established
a sect, still existent, called the “Church of the
First Born,”a combination of Evangelicalism with
Wroeism, Mormonism and Freemasonry, and it
proposed to sweep over the land as the Salvation
Army has since done, “Bignell, one of those
cunning-looking, little, small-eyed men, familiar
in church life, was John the Baptist; one Andrew
Wilson was Simon Peter; but where the bogus
Messiah evinced the most haste was in getting a
stock of Queens of Sheba, Rahabs, and the
like. Bignell, in response to heavenly visions,
“turned dog,” and founded anew order, with
a Mrs. Henderson for High Priestess; in this
connection a too venturesome Melbourne paper
got mulct at law, for alleging hanky-panky.
Wilson split off because the Prophet got a celestial
telephone that he was to have Wilson’s wife, but
ere this he got £lO to raise Wilson’s baby from
the dead, and la Elijah—and he couldn’t. Fisher
said he must have four sisters, and the husband
of one of them joined in a roaring farce, by which,
they say, he was done out of £3O, which he paid
on account of mock regalia for his induction, at
Prahran, as head of all the Freemasons in the
world. The circumstances showed him the dupe
of his own imposture. They persuaded him that
the Chief Freemason’s wife had come all the way
from Denmark with a chest of treasure for him,
and they actually showed him the woman, in Mel-
bourne. The whole affair beats the wildest fiction,
and Fisher flourishes yet.
At Christchurch (M.L.) on 12th Septembe r
last, John Bassett tried to shuffle off his earthly
responsibilities by hanging himself at the end of a
rope. He was an amateur at the work, however,
never having hanged himself before, and he was
so long in dying that Perleeceman Hex came
round the corner, and surprised him in the middle
of the unfinished operation, and ran him in.
When he recovered his second wind he explained
the situation. He had worked hard for fifty
years, and put his earnings into some investment
or other which collapsed. His relatives were all
dead. When he applied for work anywhere he
was told that a young man was preferred, and
nobody seemed to want an old man anywhere,
or under any circumstances. There was no
room for him to live, and Perleeceman Hex
wouldn’t let him die. The law remanded
Bassett off and on for a while, and then
committed him, and when he came up for
trial the judge didn’t know what to do with
him, so he bound him over in his own recog-
nisances not to do it again. It was the only thing
he could be bound over in, for his recognisances
were the only property he had. And now Bassett,
like The Bulletin and a good many other people,
probably thinks that the great want of the age is
a convenient public building for an old man to
die in. It should be a comfortable structure with
an outer office, where the registrar of births,
marriages and deaths could hang out with his big
book, and enter the particulars of each customer.
Then the man or woman who wanted to suicide
would be required to state his or her name,
age, and address (if any); also the cause of
suicide, and the mode of death preferred. The
Government would supply facilities for almost
every kind of painless and unobtrusive extinction.
There would be a huge bath where the customer
could step gently in with ten pounds of lead
linked round her waist—it is almost always a
woman who wants to die by drowning—and sink
down in the cool, clear water, and remain there
till her remains were fished out by the coroner.
There would be hanging accommodation, and no
obtrusive policemen to rush in and interfere ;
poisons of all sorts—barring those which make
the patient yell in his last moments, and similar
conveniences. No shooting would be allowed, for
the average suicide is a horribly bad shot, and
generally only maims himself ; there would be no
inquests, no information supplied to the Evening
News reporter, no snufflebusting, and no binding
over of anybody in his own recognisances. Every-
thing would be done peacefully and in order, and
then the longest-felt want in all the world would
begin to be supplied, for the first time since the
day when the first primeval policeman began to
interfere for the first time with the right of man
to die when he felt that way.

The large amount of public charity diverted
to the pockets of “ General ” Booth in England
has resulted in the total income of the London

that the Salvationist Annual Review is enthu-
siastic over the “General’s” marvellous cam-
paign in Australia. The fact is, the “General”
gave himself clean away by ever coining here at
all. The only well-advertised “distinguished
visitors” who have upheld and increased their
reputations in Australia during our recollection
are the Earl of Rosebery and the late Richard
Anthony Proctor, the astronomer.

A number of Hobart society ladies formed
part of a suffocating crowd which assembled at
Hobart Police-court the other day to hear the
depositions of the principal witnesses in the case
of alleged malpractice, prior to the despatch of an
officer, to Colombo for accused. The crowd was
disappointed, for the evidence was heard with
closed doors.
“Early marriages,” writes G. R. Sims,
“have a good deal to do with filling the workhouses.
I knew a young fellow of seventeen who, without
a penny in his pocket or a job to go to, married a
girl of his own age, and when they were married
they didn’t know where to. lay their heads.' So
eventually they went to the girl’s father, who
with his wife and eight children occupied two
rooms in a slum, and the bride brought her bride-
groom there, and that’s how they started married
life.” Which reminds us of Marcus Clarke, who
left his bride with her friends after the ceremony,
while he went to hunt for lodgings.

Dear Bulletin,—Now that N.S.W. Go-
vernment intends to impose a toll-tax on all
travelling stock, it is to be hoped it will also
protect the travelling-stock reserves, and permit
them to be used only by bond fide travelling stock.
All present leases of travelling-stock reserves
should be at once cancelled, and the reserves
placed under the protection of stock inspectors,
while heavy fines should be imposed on all tres-
passers. At present, most of the reserves are
leased (at nominal rates) to’ the adjoining lessees,
who fence them in from their other holdings, and
then keep them eaten down as bare as the centre
of a macadamised road. Though this year has
been one of the best for grass ever experienced in
N.S.W., I have seen,large mobs of cattle travelled
day after day without getting a feed ; while,
inside the lessees’ fences, the pasturage could not
be bettered. Any drovers cognisant of the present
condition of the travelling-stock routes between
Cannonbar and Wodonga will tell you the same,
