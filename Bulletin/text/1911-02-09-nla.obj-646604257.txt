Some Plays and the Theatre
If we have aothad dramatic poetry of the
highest order in a decade altogether weak in
English poetry, we certainly have had prose
dramas of fine literary and acting qualities.
The plays of the Irish writers would be not-
able in any period. The late J. M. Synge
left 6ome comedies and a tragedy stamped
with genius. Yeats deserted English poetry,
of which he is the finest living exponent,
to aid in the creation of an Irish folk-drama.
His own contributions ‘have rather too much
poetry and too little dramatic action to be
entirely successful. The most prolific play-
wright of the group is Lady Gregory, whose
comedies, though slight,, are as successful in
book form as they are on the stage. Padraic
Colum and the others have done well, but
have yet to arrive. They have wisely left
alone the sorrows of far-oif Deirdre and
endeavored to get drama out of their con-
temporaries.
Galsworthy’s Strife and The, Silver Box,
Granville Barker’s Waste, and Masefield’s
Pompey the Great are the most distinguished
of a number of plays which mark a new era
in English drama. No great creations in
comedy have been made ; but, under the in-
fluence of Ibsen, the tragic idea has been de-
veloped in new ways ; realistic and literary
in form. Galsworthy went to the common
people for his subject matter, and The Silver
Box, in which the unfortunate Jones is up
against the whole force of Society, has the
same essentials of tragedy and is handled as
artistically as Wordsworth’s Lucy Chray.
There is plenty of ready-made material of
tragedy in the story of Pompey, whose
stately figure is elevated not only by his own
greatness but by the perspective of 20 cen-
turies. While this gave Masefield some
advantage over one who was dealing with an
obscure person named Jones, it had mani-
fest drawbacks. Yet Masefield has suc-
ceeded in realising the best conceptions of
“ the noble Roman” without a slavish ad-
herence to the classic historians. (After all,
what history is accurate ? Bram Stoker, in
Famous Impostors, argues plausibly that
Queen Elizabeth was a man, and there are
grave doubts about others.)
Masefield gives the spirit that made Rome
great in this speech by Cato :
There are two Romes, Metellus. One built of
brick by hodsmen. But the Rome I serve glim-
mers in the uplifted heart. It is a court for the
ealm gods. That Rome. Let me not shame that
city. Advance the eagles !
Pompey declined at first to fight in Italy,
so that ‘ ‘ Caesar's rabble shall have no excuse
for sacking Rome ” ; and this statement of
his motives lifts the conflict above a mere
fight for boodle :
You think that I am fighting to be a master?
Not so. I am fighting because I know what
Gsesar wants. I have watched his career step by
step. Caesar means to be king... You see only
the brilliant man, winning—what he has the
power to win. I look beyond that man. I see 1
Rome under a secret, bloody domination and a
prey to future Caesars. That shall not be lam
an man now, Aeilius. I have been fighting
this battle all my life. I hope now to end it.
Masefield has daringly introduced a number
of modern phrases into his dialogue. A
“Greek writer-fellow” calls himself “a
contributor to Time’s waste-paper basket.”
Cato is described as “a lath and plaster
Spartan.” These are in harmony with the
general treatment, but “lammed it in with
a maul ” and similar expressions are jarring
notes in diction which is otherwise admirable.
The poet is manifest in this prose play, which
ends with a chantey and includes this dirge,
recited by the centurions as they carry out
the dead body of an officer :
Man is a sacred city, built of marvellous earth,
Life was lived nobly here to give this body
birth.
Something was in this brain and in this eager
hand.
Death is so dumb and blind, Death cannot
understand,
Death drifts the brain with dust, and soils the
young limbs’ glory.
Death makes women a dream and men a
traveller's story,
Death drives the lovely soul to wander under
the sky.
Death opens unknown doors—lt is most grand
to die.
\!>
This play and the others mentioned are
obtainable in book form from the principal
Sydney and Melbourne booksellers. You
can also get Fagan’s The Earth —a play re-
sembling but inferior to Waste —Besier’s
Don, and translations of some of the best
continental dramatists —Sudermann, Strind-
berg, Maeterlinck, etc. Although the read-
ing of a play is like reading the score
of an opera without hearing the music,
it is better than nothing. Even in
England it seems impossible to get plays
with ideas on to the regular stage. G. B.
Shaw has been acted fitfully in small
theatres ; but “ the books of the words,”
with elaborate prefaces and stage directions,
have had much success. Perhaps that was
due to the literary interest surpassing the
dramatic. In the case of Pompey the Great
the acting value has been proved in a per-
formance by the London Stage Society.
This society has brought out a number of
good plays which might not otherwise have
seen the boards ; and now that Charles
Frohmann’s repertory experiment has failed,
it is likely to be more useful than ever.
The repertory theatre, with its frequent
changes of bill (no play being acted more
than two or three times in uninterrupted
succession), gives an opportunity to new
dramatists and to the interested public to
see new ideas worked out. The ordinary
theatres will not entertain experiments, and
aim at the largest public in the hope ©f a
long run. P. P. H'owe, in a record and
criticism of the commercial Frohmann’s trial
of new drama— The Repertory Theatre (Angus
and Robertson) defines the movement as . . .
The secession from the conventional theatre of
those dramatic authors whose interest is in ex-
tending the scope of their art, in trying experi-
ments, and in satisfying their own sense of beauty
and fitness—as the artist in every other medium
is free to do— rather than in ensuring the highest
commercial return by subscribing to the conven-
tional ideal of the largest possible run for the
safest possible play.
Although the scheme failed in London the
repertory idea is at work successfully on
a small scale in Dublin, Manchester and
Glasgow. In Paris it is the guiding prin-
ciple of the Comedie Frangaise which is sub-
sidised by the nation.
V
Imagine what it would be like if you could
get no other fiction than that of Marie
Corelli, Guy Booth by, Frank Richardson
and their like, with an occasional piece of
Shakespeare ! That is virtually the posi-
tion with regard to the acted drama in Aus-
tralia. At rare intervals we get the equiva-
lent of an Anthony Hope or a “ Q ” story.
It is idle to hope for anything equal to a
Hardy or Meredith novel, and of Australian
yarns one kind only is permitted on the
stage.
Theatre managers are not in the business
for love, and are not conscious of a duty to
the minority who desire stronger meat tlmn
The Rosary and more delicate stuff than The
Devil’s Motor. With the hand of the box-
office on the pulse of the great public, the
managers know that they may safely con-
tinue to supply melodrama, spectacle and
frivolity. These things are enjoyable at
times ; as a regular diet they are lowering,
and tend to deprave the taste. Audiences
brought up for years on railway collisions,
blood-stained wills and “ Hi-tiddley-hi-ti ”
with ballet accompaniment, may not clamor
foranythingelse. Those whohavehad fleeting
glimpses of better things, and have read the
great plays never acted here or the new
plays which break fresh ground, would make
a considerable audience in themselves, and
there is a rising generation at the door—but
they do not offer dividends and they might
mean bankruptcy.
Dissatisfaction with the commercial drama
of the day has been made visible in the
formation of stage societies in three of our
cities. As staging and acting are not the
least important factors in the success of a
play, amateur companies with very little
capital cannot supply the deficiencies of the
regular theatres. They warm the air oc-
casionally ; but unless some benevolent
millionaire is willing to do what Miss Horni-
man did for the Irish Theatre Society, there
is no hope of seeing the interesting new
plays or many of the fine old plays until
we have a repertory theatre subsidised by the
State.
The demand for a national theatre will
come as the reading of good drama creates a
desire to see it acted. There is now slowly
growing in Australia the hope of a drama
which will crystallise Australian ideals or
reflect the life of our people. There is
raw material for drama here, and no neces-
sity to stress the Australian note by dragging
in the bushranger or the bullocky’s expletives.
Doubtless potential dramatists are nearly as
numerous as poets. The dramatic writer,
hofvever, is at an immense disadvantage
compared with any other artist. There is a
local market for stories, verse, pictures and
music. Other markets are open to pro-
ducers of these things, and a good many
Australians have struck oil abroad. Unless
the Australian playwright goes to London,
as Haddon Chambers did, and beards the
star actor in his den, or batters the managers’
doors with a storm of manuscript, he must
continue to yvrite for his own amusement,
or, at best, for solitary performances by
amateurs.
' .
Albert Dorrington is climbing rapidly to
top place amongst the suppliers of sensa-
tional fiction. His Children of the Cloven
Hoof, a horse-lifting bush yarn, now running
serially in two papers, is announced for
book publication ; also a series of yarns
about the over-worked Bully Hayes. The
Radium Terrors, which is given front place
in the January Pall MaU Maga., proves
Dorrington’s right to be considered the legi-
timate successor ©f Guy Booth by. In the
last Christmas number of the same maga.
a new Bully Hayes yarn appeared, in which
the sailors on Bully’s schooner chant these
words :
The sea is deep, the sea is wide.
But this I’ll prove whate’er betide
I’m bully in the^Jlley,
I’m bull-ee in our all-ee.
—which are part of E. J. Brady’s “Lost
and Given Over,” written some time after
Bully Hayes had ceased from troubling the
South Seas.

S. H. Leeder, being much in love with the
Arabs, went to Biskra, on the edge of the
Sahara, and spent some months in studying
the natives. Finding that religion entered
into every phase of their life, he also read up
Mahomet and the Koran. All the miscel-
laneous old 'and new information gathered
so enthusiastically he has crammed into The
Desert Gateway (George Robertson & Co.).
Anyone wanting to know about Biskra, which
is the “ Beni-Mora” of Hichens’ The Garden
of Allah, can get as much as is good for him
in Feeder’s book.
The Real France, by Laurence Jerrold
(Lane), by its title, leads one to expect
something more comprehensive and illumi-
nating than usual. Except for views of the
Black country in strike time, and of Lourdes,
Jerrold presents only the politicians, writers
and actors of Paris, and implies that Paris is
France ;
Montmartre going mad in a dozen night cafes,
and Paris up and out at dawn to work from homes
neat as bandboxes—these are miniature images of
France.
The book is a collection of magazine articles
about Briand as a realist in pblitics, Presi-
dent Fallieres, Jaures and the Socialists,
Delcasse and foreign policy, “the young”
writers and the stage of to-day. The chap-
ters on the dramatists are good.
Mecca
Augustus llalli’s ChristiansinMecca(Heme-
mann) satisfies any craving that one might
have for information of that mysterious
Arabian city. Although Mecca had a history
long before Mohammed kicked up the dust,
Ralli’s book deals exclusively with the ex-
citing history of the various Christians who
have managed to reach the city despite the
order of Mohammed, issued in 629 a.»., that
henceforth no unbeliever should set foot in or
gaze upon the holy place. The very fact that
it was forbidden started a regular trickle of
adventurous unbelievers towards the barren
valley in which the place lies. The gentle
Meccans had a pleasant way of rewarding
those who managed to reach the city and had
the luck to be discovered. They hung them,
alive, on hooks on the wall of the city, and
allowed them to stay there till they disap-
peared in the course of nature. Yet some
got through and came back to tell what they
had seen. Two of them were photographers,
and brought back good negatives.
The first of/living European pilgrims to reach
Mecca was John Fryer Keane, who, in 1903,
worked 95 days of 12 hours each in the cane
brakes of Northern Queensland to prove that
a White Australia and sugar growing were
not incompatible. He was born in 1854
at Whitby, England ; the son of a canpu.
At the age of 12 he ran away to sea and
spent seven exciting years among Moham-
medans, which made him so accustomed to
their ways and language that he was easily
able to pass himself o|F as a true believer.
He went to Mecca in tlie train of an Indian
ameer, and was one of 200,000 pilgrims
assembled at the same time % in the desolate
city. An Indian child accused him of being
a Christian, and a mob attacked him, but his
proficiency in Arab swearing convinced the
crowd it had made a blunder.
One of the things that paralysed him in
Mecca was a house fronted with a large
blackboard bearing in yellow letters the
magic word “ LODGINGS.” This roused
Keane’s interest immensely. In spite of
himself he was driven to investigate, and
found the owner was a Cape of Good Hope
Malay. The Malay was not pleased at being
addressed in English, and informed Keane
that Englishmen often turned Mohammedan
to see the Pilgrimage, and then wrote books
about it. ... “ Just now there are three of
them, with iron collars round their necks,
chained among the hills.” Keane took it to
be a lie. The Malay’s manner was not re-
assuring, so Keane denied being English, or
even European, and got rid of his dangerous
friend by trying to beg a few coins from him.
The Malay left at once.
Keane found an Englishwoman in Mecca.
She was about 40 years of age, and had been
20 years among the Mohammedans. She
was one of the English children who had
fallen into the hands of the mutineers at
Lucknow, and had been married, whether
she would or wouldn’t, to one of the leading
mutineers. And she told him that many of
the leading rebels whom the English had
tried to capture by setting a price on their
heads had taken refuge in Mecca. Her
name was Macintosh, the daughter of a
doctor, and she was making a precarious
living in Meeca by embroidering skull caps.
Ralli’s book is brightly written and ab-
sorbingly interesting.—C. A. J.
W, W. : —At last, after about 300 years, the
dramatic and poetic works of George Chap-
man are being issued in a really good collected
edition— The Plays and Poems of George Chap-
man edited by Thomas Mare Parrott, (Rout-
ledge, 3 vols., each 65.). The first volume,
which contains the tragedies, has just ap-
peared. In a note on page 563 there is a
reference to Brereton’s review of Boas’s
Bussy D’Ambois, “ published in the Sydney
Bulletin (Australia).” Brereton’s article
was published at the University.
Chapman is better known to fame as the
author of Chapman’s Homer than as an original
poet and dramatist, but this volume of
tragedies is full of splendor ,and sonority, the
fitful light and heart-lifting niusic of a
stormy night. Few of his plays are excel-
lent in construction, and among the tragedies
only one—if severely edited—could hope for
even a moderate suceess before an excep-
tionally intelligent audience of our day. The
poet may sometimes be obscure and some-
times strenuous to deformity, but he is
never weak. His energy and lofty pride are
a continual joy.
THE HEAD MAN.
" (^, ood ®Y enin ,K.” said the Dead Man, who had
nf'rh 10 f w , lnt;o the chair on the other side
ot the table. I recognised (from photographs) a
man who for half a century was very famous on
the earth Revolutionary or Redeemer ; madman
or Messiah; at any rate, one of the giant figures
of the world in the century 19-20.
abrutl at they Saying ab ° Ut me? ” he asked,
lhe usual things,” I replied. "The news-
papers vary from two columns to a page. Poets
ana novelists are writing eulqgies, and amateurs
in psychology are dissecting your soul. You are
•titantic or eccentric. It is all flattery, so far.
Jjater, toe biographers will cheapen you.”
1 know,” he said.
I have seen your name spelt in seven different
ways. But though they boggle at your name,
they all say that you will survive as a potent force
in human history.”
He laughed ; that is to say, I received an im-
pression of brief laughter, with a note of easy
scorn in it. "Until,” lie said, "human history
adopts its usual plan of forgetting me.”
"A great man of modern times,” I said, sen-
tentiously, "will find"it difficult to be forgotten.
Printed records endure, and can be easily repro-
duced. In every generation there are regiments
of students rummaging in obscure corners of his-
tory for picturesque remnants.”
He laughed again. “Down there,” he began,
with a vague wave of his hand... I felt as though
his hand had scooped open for my eyes the vast and
ancient earth, full of unnumbered graves. The
vision was huge beyond thought. Incalculable
billions of dead men drifted before my sight.
“ Down there !” I echoed. “ What—what is it
like down there ? ”
“It’s queer,” he said. “Strangely im-
mense. You cannot think what a population the
grave contains. We don’t speak, we don’t move,
we don’t meet; we are just aware of oneanother;
that is all. Yon talk of my being remembered,
immortally. Listen. Stretch your mind to its
grandest conception, and yet you will not realise
how many there are among us, who were as great
in their lives as I was, but are forgotten. Count
us, and you are counting the grains of dust in the
earth.”
“Yet there are unforgotten, unforgettable,
men,” I murmured, and grasped names at random.
“King David, Homer, Tamerlane, Shakespear.”
At this I felt quiet laughter rising round me.
“Scratch with si pin at the past,” the Dead Man
said, “ and you will go back some few thousands
of years. Behind those is the measureless anti-
quity of mankind. Poets before Isaiah, law-
givers before Moses, brave men before Agamem-
non. I tell you we are innumerable. Do you
know what that means? All the dust in the
streets is the dust of dead men who were proud
and great in their day.”
“ We have heard of them.” I said stubbornly,
“Heard!” he cried. “You have heard me
preach renunciation and humility. Heard of
John the Baptist eating locusts and wild honey ;
of hermits, stagirites and saints. There were
millions-before them, as great and greater. Your
poets sing heroes. Only one poet whom you know
told the truth :
When you and I behind the Veil are past,
Oh, but the long, long while the World shall last.
Which of our Coming and Departure heeds
As the Sea’s self should heed a pebble-cast.
Some tens of millions of poets said it before he
thought of it, and they were of creeds apd colors
of which you have never heard.”
“Go away and write me down Immortal,” he
added. "As for me, I know where I am. lam
Dead.”
And he was gone.

Clements Tonic Saved Life
It may Save Yours if You Need Health. Read this Wonderful Letter.
(Exact copy of letter received.)
CLEMENTS TONIC LIMITED.
It is with the deepest feeling of gratitude that I write to tell you that in my
opinion Clements Tonic is a remedy of most marvellous powers and the most
wonderful medicine known.
I have been for 28 years in business in Hobart. lam well known to every-
one there, and 24 years ago I was taken very ill with Hydatids of the Liver,
which resulted in several serious operations, and which led to continuous ill-
health afterwards. Like a sick woman will, I tried many experts and their
medicines, and these failing, I resorted to advertised medicines, without regain-
ing my health or strength.
I suffered, as the result of the operations, from LOSS OF MEMORY,
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, DIZZINESS, CHRONIC INSOMNIA or
LOSS OF SLEEP, POOR APPETITE and INDIGESTION. I could not
walk across the room I was so weak; in fact, I thought I would never be able
to attend to my business again.
Seeing Clements Tonic advertised, I decided to try a bottle, and found it to
act like magic in giving me an appetite and better nerve strength, sol decided
to continue it, and this is the result: To-day, lam alive and well. Although
this critical period of my life happened 24 years ago, I am here in the flesh
to-day, thanks to that splendid medicine, which cured me of the ailments
specified in this letter, NERVOUS BREAKDOWN IN PARTICULAR. I
had no more sleepless nights, and in a few weeks, after taking it, I was strong
and well, and used to rise in the morning as happy as a lark. I can give you
the names of dozens of Hobart citizens who know these words are true, also the
name of the chemist there who sold me the tonic, Mr. A. P. Miller, Liverpool
Street, Hobart, and from whose pharmacy I have often bought it since.
I always recommend Clements Tonic to persons in ill-health, because I
know what it is and what its use means for women, and I hope you will use this
letter in the great cause of suffering humanity.

All the Clements Tonic testimonies can be fully verified. In this instance Mrs. Nietom called in person,
whilst on a visit to Sydney, and gave this splendid testimony without any request for it. It proves what
this splendid medicine can really do, and what a boon it is to the run-down man or woman continuously
out of sorts and ill through worry, over-work or study, hereditary weakness, insomnia or loss of sleep,
constipation, sluggish liver, or kidney irregularities. Women who have a tendency to anaemia, sick
headache, neuralgia, melancholia, nervous breakdown, the result of fever, periodic illness or shock
should get it and get well. Thousands swear by it and recommend it for use all over Australia, and to thia
general end all CHemistS and Stores sell it throughout the Commonwealth. Gst ifa.

absolute cure for your trouble with-
out any inconvenience.
The Vecsey Method of

less, external treatment that at once
alleviates the pain caused by Vari-
cose Veins and then rapidly reduces
and ultimately entirely restores the
vein to a normal state without laying
up or detention from business.

Plight not in this, the hour we part,
Fond vows to love for aye ;
Each red rose has its hour, sweetheart,
And every love its day.
Clasp hands and kiss !—ah, burning tears
To-morrow’s winds will dry,
No ripple on the tide of years
Shall tell of this good-bye.
For you may live a time, a place,
A word, a light-flung gage;
For me, a half-forgotton face
On Memory’s wizard page.
Clasp hands and kiss ! —ah ! lips that cling.
Ah ! flesh that cleaves to flesh !
The wanton moments haste to bring
New victims to the mesh.
Clasp hands and kiss !—to-day we part,
To-morrow ?—pluck who may

Ghosts.
There is no hour in all my days
But bears its pleasant ghosts along:
In strange scenes and in common ways
A host of old companions throng,
Reminded by some present view
To glad me with their company ;
And so 1 meet old friends anew' —
The things we love can never die.
When the bright moon with silver lance
Has touched the world bewitchingly
And cast an edging of romance
On passion’s shadowed mysterv,
Fair faces all about me hem
(And she has little need to sigh
Who has the love of all of them)—
I he things we love can never die.
When chinking glasses go the rounds
Departed friends still drink with me ;
They aid the feast when joy abounds
And cheer me in adversity.
There is no lover I have known
But swells some present ecstasy ;
The grossness and the ill are flown ;
The things we love can never die.
N.s.w.
HANER.
In Town.
I have a few good pals in town—a decent bunch
of chaps
Who do not bathe in milk, nor take pink poodles
in their laps;
Who get no nervous twitchings when the Governor
goes by,
But watch his horses’ action with a clear and
quizzing eye ;
Who do not, if they meet a man, go crawling
round his boots,
Nor put an English accent on—like those poor
slavish coots
Who think their dreadful dignity will fall off if
they grin;
I know a few white men in town— good pals
through thick and thin.
But O, the long, grey line of those who track
about the town,
Loose-jointed racks for English rags, who love to
mark you down,
And grab your coat-flap lovingly, and put a
clammy claw
Upon your arm as you go by; to lay down silly
law
On parlor politics and such, to spout their little
slabs
Of foolish talk on “sport” and skirt—the lop-
eared It that blabs
Weird secrets of the trysting-place, strange men-
things, knave-and-fool,
Who wear tight stays, and, socked in silk, tell
cads’ tales out of school.
They wallow daily in the small, stale scandal of
the streets;
They know each other’s pedigrees ; their sad con-

At mayoral balls, and seeks the shade of paper

With simpering slips of frill and fluff—swift,

And always, when I stroll and catch the pale,
effusive eye, .
O, Lord 1 I hate such trifling trash—when Willy

I want to fling my wardrobe off and wear blue

To drop my starchy shirt and run wild in the

The Early Birds.
I wandered in the wintry morn #
Cold, damp and utterly forlorn.
And saw them passing in the grey,
Chill drifts of mist, ere yet ’twas day.
The workers huddled in their clo’s,
Like ill-drilled reg-i-ments in rows,
They hastened to their daily graft.
I leaned upon a fence and laughed.
From Queen Ann villas half a score,
I heard their portly masters snore.
And yet the proverb doth affirm
The early bird will catch the worm.

methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-

but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bullktin,” is the proper
superscription for "copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there ; the official

HIGH PROTECTION, IMMIGRATION AND
NATIONAL PRESERVATION.
Mr. Bowman, Queensland Labor leader, said he opposed
tlie introduction of free laborers as immigrants. The
effect would be to bring wages down .—Daily paper.
The Labor party has hitherto struggled along in a
more-or-less sort of fashion without any defined
fiscal policy or any comprehensive official views
on the subject of immigration. It is time it
remedied the defect, for though a party that is in
chronic Opposition can get along without a
lot of important views, the position is dif-
ferent when it begins to be the party in
office. For any Australian Government to
be opposed to the immigration of desirable white
citizens would be a calamity in a country which
wants defenders so badly, and would also be a
shameful acknowledgment of the Government’s
incompetence. Australia is no mean land. It
isn’t the desert which it used to he described. It
is the most thinly-peopled country among the
desirable countries of this earth ; in fact, there
are as yet mere traces of human habitation on its
surface. If a continent of such possibilities
and suqh conditions can’t admit hundreds of
thousands of intelligent, healthy and well-
conducted white citizens without bringing
financial disaster on the smattering of citi-
zens who are already here, then the admini-
stration of its affairs must be rotten in the
extreme. Provided there is available land for the
agricultural settler and available work for the
artisan, there is nothing wrong with a vigorous
immigration policy, and now that the Labor
party controls the tariff and the progressive land-
tax, and has a great territory of its own to dispose
of besides, the fault rests with it if this land isn t
clamoring for immigrants with a clamor that
ascends to the roof of Heaven. Its efforts to make
this a desirable p'.aee for agricultural settlers may
be nullified to some extent by the congestion
policy of State railway managements ; but State
railway management, with its narrow-mindedness
and incapacity, can be wiped out at
if the Federal authority is in real earnest. There-
fore the anti-immigration attitude, which was
justifiable when the Tories were in full possession
of the political citadel, is justifiable no longer. It
is one tiling for a party to say that its enemies
have made the country unfit for a white immi-
grant to come to. It is quite another thing to say
that in this respect it isn’t a whit better than its
enemies.
Australia is confronted by two alternatives. It
can be Freetrade and import goods, or it can be
genuinely Protectionist and import a lot more
men so that it may be able to make the goods
here. The former is a cowardly process whereby
the community winks at evils abroad—at long
hours, poor pay, the exploitation of child labor,
dirt and starvation—which it wouldn’t tolerate
for a moment in its own territory. It is a process
by which it buys and uses goods made under
sweating and non-union conditions such as it
would regard with horror if they existed at its
own door, and professes to consider that its
sin doesn’t count because the horrors are
outside certain artificial boundaries. On the other
hand, by shutting out the goods and importing
the workers, Australia could be sure that the
things it eats and drinks and wears were made by
people who live as white people ought to do. If
the articles cost a little more in consequence, it is
worth while to pay a little more in order to make
certain of being free of the shame of buying from
the sweater and patronising the individual who
grinds the faces of the poor, even if he sweats
aliroad and grinds the countenances of the poor
afar off. If the bringing in of white
immigrants, under good Protectionist and in-
dustrial conditions, reduces the wages of
the people already in the country, which
seems a most improbable circumstance, it can only
he because part of these wages represent the pro-
fits made by buying cheap goods from the extrane-
ous sweater. There is no other way in which such
a result could he achieved in a place which is
not overcrowded, and in which there is still suffici-
ent land to meet all legitimate requirements. So
Australia lias these propositions in front of it. It
may believe in Freetrade, low wages and sweating,
or it may believe in high Protection and immigra-
tion.
* * * *
Now that the Labor party is at the top of
affairs, it is time for it to decide that it is the
party of high Protection and desirable white im-
migration, and that no one who doesn’t be-
lieve with all his soul in these two prin-
ciples can belong to it. There is far less
blinking of the fiscal issue to-day than
there used to be; but still there is a
great deal too much, and even among those
Labor men who call themselves Protectionists
the fiscal faith is often rather casual and some-
what perfunctory. Last year the Commonwealth
imported nearly £60,000,000 worth of goods,
which was the biggest figure on the country’s
record. Every pennyworth of that amount got
in on the merits of its cheapness. There was no
inquiry as to how long were the hours, how small
the wages, or how horrible the conditions of the
folk who made the goods. It was a case in
which the most successful sweater got the pref-
ence—on which the output of the boniest
female skeleton toiling hardest in the cheap-
est London attic was taken, while that
of the better-paid employee was left. The
fact that the skeleton might be in London
instead of Melbourne or Sydney made no
difference in the fact that Australia was the
buyer of the goods, and as such was, in the last
resource, the skeleton’s employer and the person
ultimately responsible for its hunger and its
bones. Of course, Australia doesn’t actually
know how bad are the worst conditions under
which its imports are made, but it knows that it
could find out if it really wanted to. Also, it
knows for certain that in the importing game it is
the worst that survives, and that it is deriving
any profit that is to be secured in the business
from the survival of the most damnable. If it shut
down to the utmost of its ability on the purchase
of foreign articles, and instead imported the
workers and had the goods manufactured here, it
would be compelled for very shame’s sake to see
that fair wages were paid and fair conditions
observed. That would involve a certain amount
of trouble. Also, if the importing business means
wholesale patronage of the non-unionist and the
sweater, then local manufacture, with the non-
unionist and the sweater eliminated, would cost
more. On the other hand, if the imported goods
are made under conditions which a good Australian
unionistneed not be ashamed of, then local manufac-
ture need not cost any more. In other words, local
manufacture would cost more, provided importa-
tion is a sin which is dragging this country’s
soul down to Hell, and not otherwise. And apart
from financial considerations, local industry means
a chance of national safety, while importation
doesn’t. The artisan will fight when called upon,
but the bale of foreign shoddy never shouldered a
rifle in its life.
THE POSSIBILITY OF LAND
NATIONALISATION.
One day last week the Labor Conference decided
to retain land nationalisation as a plank of the
party platform, and next morning both Sydney
morning papers leaped in the air with cries of loud
amaze and asked how the thing was to be done.
They both preserved their usual cumbersome
attitude of grief at the financial incapacity of the
Labor party, and they put on the customary aspect
of the schoolmaster who laboriously instructs the
infant class in matters of elementary know-
ledge. This, for instance, was part of the
Telegraph’s jeremiad on the subject:—
The country delegate to the Labor Conference who
said that, after “ working it out in figures,” lie found it
would cost £800,000,000 to nationalise the land in-
cautiously called attention to the snag which lies direct
in the course of any party proposing nationalisation.
There are two ways of obtaining what belongs to other
people, one being by buying it and the other by taking
it, and the question has the same two sides for Labor as
it would have for the private individual covetous of his
neighbor's goods, except that a political party might try
to effect the grabbing process by the gradual method of
taxing the value off the desired property. Nationalising
the land by paying for it, however, is hopelessly impos-
sible, because it is at least doubtful whether the amount
of the price could be raised, and if it could it would have
to be borrowed with the land as security so that the real
owner would be the big capitalists, and things would be
worse than ever. Hence the cherished purpose of con-
cealing the impracticability of the honest course and
keeping silent about the alternative one, which is con-
fiscation without compensation.
And this was a portion of the speech of the S. M.
Herald on the same topic :
It is a very notable thing that the Conference would not
allow any descent to details. Awkward questions were
either ignored or shelved, and ways and means were not
even discussed. No one can say that the State will buy
out present freeholders. Several delegates insisted that
as the State could tax all land as heavily as it pleased, it
was practically in possession ; and while this was, no
doubt, intended to turn the flank of the “ whole lioggers
led by Mr. Watson, it showed the mind of the Conference.
Mr. Watson was determined that the State should have
the unearned increment of land, but he would not say
whether estates were to be purchased right out or taxed
out. In the latter event the State would stand alone as
possible purchaser, and make its own terms. Where
could the hundreds of millions sterling be raised that
would be necessary to buy out the freeholders?
* * * *
These hundreds of millions are evidently the
great boss bugbear of the anti-Labor party. Con-
fiscation, of course, is utterly unthinkable as a
means to land nationalisation —just as much so
as would be repudiation of the public debt.
And any form of taxation that is meant to
l>e confiscation in disguise is unthinkable also.
Having got that far, the Tory press announces
that the only other possibility is repurchase,
which statement is true enough ; that the only
possible way to repurchase is to borrow the
money, which yarn is wholly untrue ; and that,
consequently, the entire idea of land nationalisa-
tion crumples up and falls down dead, which
narrative is plain lying and insensate folly.
Whether land nationalisation is the best all-round
policy or not has never been quite decided. It is
almost certainly the best in cities, where great
blocks of offices make it impossible for every
tenant to be his own landlord, But so far as
agricultural and pastoral lands are concerned, it
doesn’t seem to matter much whether they
are nationalised or not, so long as the
aggregation of big estates is absolutely
prohibited, and there is provision, by a
tax on rents or otherwise, to eliminate the mere
loafing proprietor and make sure that the tenant
and the owner will be one and thesame individual.
Still, if it is proposed to repurchase and nationalise
all the estate with which the Government has
parted, the thing isn’t impossible. It can’t be
done in a day, certainly ; in fact, it will probably
spread over many years. But the fund which is
to be the beginning of the work can be established,
and the work itself can be started with the assur-
ance that it will soon be going on a fairly large
scale, and that when once it is started it will pro-
gress faster and faster with each succeeding year.
And all this can be effected without any
£800,000,000 loan—in fact, it can be done without
any loan at all.
Taking the case of N.S.W. as a fairly typical
one. Among the great assets of that State is the
ground value of Sydney. Leaving out the values
created by expenditure on roads, bridges, wharves,
reclamations, etc., there is a gigantic asset which
has come into existence simply because the place
is Svdney—simply by reason of the gathering to-
gether of people. These people do more than create
mere ground values; they also cause the railways
and tramways and other Government services to be
highly profitable assets. Therefore the people
are a stupendous asset —especially to those who
own the land they live upon. If the Government
was sole ground landlord of Sydney and its
suburbs, it would have made an enormous stride in
the direction of land nationalisation, and its
ground rents would provide a fund for the com-
pulsory and continuous repurchase of alienated
lands, and their rents would add to the fund and
made the process of repurchase more and more
rapid. In fact, if the Government was the
sole ground landlord of Sydney, it would
be its own fault if the complete nationali-
sation of the lands of the State was not in
sight. The position would be the same if it owned
another city like Sydney or one which wassteadily
growing to be like Sydney. It would be the same,
only more so, if it owned two or three such cities.
And it could own two or three such cities if it
wanted them. The deep-water harbors are there.
The sites are there. The need for the cities, to
save useless haulage and to supply cheap and con-
venient outlets for rich districts which are blighted
for want of them, is so great that it is only by the
most desperate efforts that they have been pre-
vented from arising long ago. The country
is paying a lot of money to-day to de-
viate the North Coast line in a wide
semi-circle lest there should be a great and pros-
perous seaport and a valuable public asset at Port
Stephens. It is spending another vast sum to
lengthen a hopelessly unpayable line in order to
carry the Monaro trade some 300 miles further
than it need go lest there should be a city and a
great public asset at Twofold Bay. All it
requires to do is to abandon this policy of
paying away money to avoid making money
—acquire certain large uninhabited areas at
their present prairie value ; to make a few short,
cheap and, it is almost certain, highly profitable
railways, instead of wasting its money on long and
immensely costly lines which don’t show any
reasonable immediate prospect of profit; to
lay out the plans of certain cities, grant
building leases to all desirable applicants, and
then Collect the rents. The cities would grow of
themselves. There would be local authorities to
construct wharves, jetties, docks, water-works,
sewers, and all other essentials —at the expense of
the people who had put up buildings on Govern-
ment land. The Government would merely sit
down and watch the land which it had bought at
very little per acre become worth a very great
deal per foot, and collect, in addition to these
profits, the profits of the railways which had made
such things possible. In fact, it would be the be-
ginning of Melbourne over again, only with better
prospects, a better harbor, and the private landlord
eliminated. In addition to this, there are great
possibilities in the way of the establishment of
new State-owned border towns when the policy of
refusing to connect railway lines with those of
tiie next State is abandoned and matters are per-
mitted to take their natural course. In fact, the
possibilities are almost illimitable.
* * * *
If the N.S.W. Government would give up the
desperate and costly struggle to prevent all this
money reaching it, the way of land nationalisation
would be comparatively easy. Probably it could
nationalise half the State east of the Darling-
half, that is, in point of value—without turning a
hair, and with the revenue from that it could
nationalise the other half without turning a hair
either. The process might be lengthy, but it
would probably be shorter than any other pos-
sible method, and vastly cheaper and far less
calculated to raise a storm which might, in the
end, prove fatal to the party and all its projects.
Unhappily, there is always a doubt whether the
Labor leaders really desire to nationalise the land
or only want to talk about doing it. Certainly,
the State Labor men in N.S.W. have shown very
little sign of enthusiasm in the matter. By their
conspicuous lack of energy in the cause of decen-
tralisation they have steadily identified them-
selves with the private landlords of Sydney,
and these stand for nearly half the pri-
vate landlordism of the State. When an
actual and definite opportunity came along to
nationalise a city—the Federal city—and a bit of
land around it, and a seaport, most of them were
found fighting their hardest to make it a very
small city, and a very hopeless port, and a very
meagre and barren scrap of land. It was the
very first chance to do some land nationalisation,
and they toiled as energetically to reduce that
chance to the lowest possible denomination
and to make it as poor and ineffective as possible'
as did any Tory of them all. In fact, it was this
question winch drew James McGowen and
OrKEGOKY Wadk together, and reduced the former
to a state of gibbering admiration for the latter
that was painful to contemplate. These things
do not necessarily prove that all the Labor
leaders are dead cold on the land nationalisation
question except as a useful war cry, but they cer-
tainly suggest that a fairly large section of them
is much nearer to the temperature of the feet of
an Arctic expedition than it should be.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Woes of Holman and Meagher.
The State Frights bogey appeared in full force
last week at the Political Labor League confer-
ence, and, as might have been expected, Holman
and Meagher were in charge of the terrifying
object. They had failed to persuade the Labor
party to vote a solid “No*” at the Federal
referendum next April—in fact, the conference
rather held that the party ought to vote a solid
‘‘Yes.” So the State Frights section dug up a
side issue to the effect that it was undemocratic
for large and small States to be equally repre-
sented in the Senate. And it blandly proposed that
the transfer to the Commonwealth of the control of
industrial legislation and other matters should
be effected —after the Senate had been reorganised
so as to represent the States on a population
basis. That meant, of course, an indefinite post-
ponement, and it also gave an opportunity to drag
the cadaverous red herring of the Ma State’s
grievance across the track of the matter under
discussion. The brilliant and courteous Meagher
put the case as follows :
After 11 years the truth of the old adage that he who
sowed the wind would reap the whirlwind was coming on
them with full force. . . . Every voter in Australia
should stand on his own base. He refused to allow 30
cabbage-growers in Victoria to outweigh 100 intelligent
people in this State.
The remarks were hardly relevant to the subject,
but they revealed the ignorant, frenzied and hog-
like hatred cherished by a certain undesirable
species of Waler against the one State which did
the unpardonable sin of overshadowing N.S.W.
in population and wealth for something like 40
years. The off-hand assumption that Victorians
are agricultural clods, and not intelligent like
Meagher’s own people, isn’t a matter of
much importance; on a point like that every
legal gentleman is entitled to his own opinion.
The really interesting feature of the case is that
Victoria is the most under-represented State in
the Commonwealth bar N.S.W., and that on a
population basis it would have 11 senators instead
of the six it actually possesses ; also that it takes
84 (not 30) Victorians to count for as much at a
Senate election as 100 brilliant N. S. Walers like
Meagher. So that person was talking violently
through a very inefficient hat. On the other
hand, this was Holman’s complaint, if the S. M.
Herald’s report is accurate
They could measure the relative importance of the
States either by their population Or by their respective
contribution to the strength of the Labor movement in
the Federal Parliament. Tims New South Wales sent
into the House of Representatives 18 out of the 42 mem-
bers in the Labor party. Yet on important questions of
policy which might make or mar the success of the Labor
movement in this State, which was the body and bones
of the cause, it was. quite possible, with the inter-State
conference constituted, in such an undemocratic way,
that the N.S.W. delegates would be outvoted.
So Holman’s woe, which seems even a madder
one than Meagher’s, is that 18 Labor mem-
bers from N.S.W. are not allowed at all times
to overrule 24 from other States. In these cir-
cumstances the basis of the present State Frights
movement looks shaky. Certainly the system by
which States of large population like N.S.W.
and Victoria have no more representation
in the Senate than small ones like Tas-
mania is undemocratic in theory, but in prac-
tice Ma State hasn’t got left to any great de-
gree. It has secured the Federal capital, and
lias got it where its State Government
demanded. It has got the Federal port, and the
arms factory, and most of the bonuses that have
been paid up to date, and a recent return shows
that it has had more of the Defence expenditure
than would come its way on a strictly population
basis. Also, it is going strong with a demand for
the naval base, the Federal shipbuilding yards,
the military headquarters, and about one-third of
the Port Darwin railway, the rest to be divided
between Queensland and the Territory.. Vic-
toria’s share of the things that are going appears
to be the temporary possession of the Australian
Parliament, and Tasmania’s (though Tasmania has
more Parliamentary representation in proportion
to the numbers of its people than any other State)
seems to be absolutely nil. Thereis certainly a theo-
retical grievance about the Senate membership,
but as the State with the worst grievance has
come off so well, there is very little immediate
basis for the Holman-Meagiiek worry. More-
over, those two persons represent a party which
has always sacrificed N.S.W. to Sydney, and
treated all N.S.W., which isn’t Sydney, as a
foreign and accursed land only existing to pay
tribute to the capital. One reason why a large
section of N.S.W. will vote ‘‘Yes” on the refer-
dum and on many other referenda is that it would
sooner trust for justice even to the over-bloated
Tasmanian delegation in the Senate than to llOL-
man and Meagher and people of their way of
thinking.
♦
The Manufacturer, the Factory Hand and
the Keferendum.
Two industrial difficulties at present agitating cer-
tain sections of Victoria afford strong reasons
why the electors should vote “Yes” in April.
Out of the depths of its wisdom the Weary
Government has given the contract for the electric
installation at Wontliaggi to a foreign co., whose
tender was a few thousands under those of Aus-
tralian engineers. In excusing the Government’s
folly, Treasurer Watt says that he has to spend
the State money to the best advantage —which is
begging the whole question —and that “a big firm
like the one that lias secured the contract does
things on such a large scale that it can manufac-
ture more cheaply than the local firms can.” To
this, the Australian engineers reply truly that
every contract the State Government sends out of
the country renders the Australian less able to
compete with the foreigner. Also, they ask how
they can hope to compete with the American or
German under existing conditions. Ihese
foreign manufacturers have their own home
market reserved to them by a high Protective
tariff, and have little if any restriction by industrial
law; while the Australian has to pay a minimum
wage for the maximum 48 working hours, yet
gets only a ridiculous per cent, of Protection
for his generators and motors, while on liis engines
he has no Protection at all. The other difficulty
bearing on the same subject refers to the starch-


making industry. On this article Parliament has
placed the choroughly Protective duty of P^
l‘>.—2d. to British-made starch—equal to over DU
per cent. Consequently the Australian starcn-
maker has full control of his home market, and
can scoff at the foreigner. Here, also, a Wages
■Board has fixed the workers’ minimum pay ana
their maximum hours. In June, 1907, the Board
fixed the minimum wage for most starch-makers
at 365. for 48 hours, and on appeal Justice
Hood confirmed this decision. Last Septem-
ber the employees appealed, asking ttiat
the Board might revise its finding, and,
the appeal being granted, the matter was thrasned
out afresh. The decision finally rested with the
chairman, who determined that there was no
reason to disturb the rates fixed in 1907, and that
365. was a proper wage for an adult male starch-
worker. Wherefore, when many democrats are
asked why they fail to see the urgent necessity of
a high tariff, they instance the 50 or 60 per cent,
duty of the starch trade and the 365. per week
minimum wage, and ask, “ Where’s the good ot
the Protection?” There is an answer to that.
Without the Protect.on, as in the electrical
machinery case, there wouldn’t be 365. a
week to be earned or even 36d. But with
High Protection, there ought to be higher wages,
i'he two tilings ought to move together ; and the
only way to establish that is to give to the body
that grants the tariff Protection the power
to direct a fair proportion of that pro-
tection into the pockets of the employees.
Vice versa, when higher wages are thought neces-
sary, the power to increase the wages should be
in tlie hands of the authority which has the ex-
clusive right to raise the tariff. If that proposition
is accepted—if it is agreed that the same authority
should control the two things (which are really
one thing)—then a “Yes” must be recorded on
April 26.
Tlie Tory Prophet, and the Laborite Who
Was Inclined to Accept Him.
One of life’s diverting spectacles is the smug
satisfaction of the Tory when a prominent Labor-
ite shows signs of adopting an anti-democratic
attitude. So often as that occurs, the hide-
merchant and the tallow-retailer and the small
solicitor round the corner and the frowsy com-
mission agent in the cellar below the basement
floor, come together and point out loftily that
these things are bound to happen when persons of
the laboring classes achieve education and the com-
mon sense that marches with maturity. This coined y
was duly enacted last week when it became known
that W. A. Holman was wavering on the State
Frights or Reactionary side of the Referenda fence,
There is a blatant dogmatism about the Tory, in
these circumstances, which says a lot for his
optimism, his disregard of past defeats and so on.
When chatting with tolerant pity of the mad,
freakish proposals of Labor, he omits to mention
—in fact, hardly seems to realise—that nine-
tenths of the Labor theories which he denounced
as “ wild ” and “impracticable” yesterday, are
accepted by him to-day without a protest. it is
not a decade since the same daily paper students
who, last week, applauded Holman, what time
they gravely laid it down that the carrying of the
Referenda proposals would mean the ruin of
N.S.W., were shouting themselves hoarse concern-
ing the wicked futility of the White Australia
ideal. How many of them would have the nerve,
to-day, to get up m a public place and advocate a
piebald Australia? Holman’s allies of last week
are the same short-sighted people who bitterly
opposed the Aliens Immigration Restriction Act
(the Act which we borrowed from America, and
which England subsequently borrowed from us);
and by their lies concerning drowned Lascars and
gaoled hatters rendered Australia’s name a by-
word in foreign parts for years and years. They
are the folks who foresaw in Protection a curse
that would transform the Commonwealth into a
necessitous and pauper-ridden land. Also, they
are the lamentable strategists who propounded
the view that compulsory service was an in-
famy, and an Australian navy a scheme no
thinking patriot would entertain. And they
put forward an alternative defence policy—
Dreadnausea. Supporters of the preposterous
‘‘Dreadnought scheme” are rarer than Free-
traders nowadays ; and the general tendency is
to treat the man who argues against local defence
as a freak. Those who cheered Holman last
week, because they understood that he meant to
oppose the Referenda and help save N.S. W. from
“ disaster,” are the identical citizens who foretold
doom to the Ma State from the introduction of the
Arbitration and Conciliation principle. They are
likewise the foolish ones whose legs Georgk Reid
pulled violently in his Anti-Sosh campaign. They
took the stout jester’s Socialistic Tiger seriously
as lately as three years ago. They swallowed
his calculations re the number of quadrillions
sterling Chuis. Watson would have to raise to
“ socialise every fruit, lolly and other shop in the
Commonwealth,” as readily as they did the absurd-
ity, printed and approved by the Telegraph a few
days back, to the effect that the land nationalisa-
tion plank in the N.S. W. Labor Party’s platform
imposed on McGowen the obligation of imme-
diately borrowing £800,000,000. The excited folk
who are yelling Socialism, confiscation, burst
marriage bonds, filched rights and blue ruin gene-
rally, because there is a prospect of the Australian
Government’s Referenda proposals being carried,
uttered all these yells when Factory Acts, Pure
Food Bills and Early Closing legislation first
loomed. In brief, they are the most futile of all
prophets. Even Old Moore and the dilapidated
female in the remote suburb, who tells your for-
tune for a bob, occasionally blunder on a correct
vaticination ; but the Tory Forecaster of Doom,
never. Which makes their recent kindly, supe-
rior approval of the N.S.W. Labor Attorney-
General the more humorless. So much so, in-
deed, that one wonders, at the time of writing,
whether he isn’t sorry he ever achieved it.
Freetrade in Ships.
The need for a heavy duty on imported ships has
stuck out for many years past, and .it doesn’t
become less conspicuous with the passage of Time.
Shipmaking is one of Australia’s dead industries,
and there are times when it threatens ,to become
one of Bull’s dead industries also. In earlier
days there was much marine architecture done in
these parts. The local timber was first-class, and
the workmen were equal to any others on
earth, and Hobart was as good as Glasgow then,
and Balmain looked like rivalling Belfast. But
steam superseded sails, and iron ships became the
fashion ; and iron plates didn’t grow on trees ;
nor did steel machinery; and a generation of
fools hesitated to create an iron and steel indus-
try to keep the shipbuilding business alive. So
it perished to all intents and purposes, and of all
the great fleets of big swift steamers owned in
Australasia not one vessel of the slightest import-
ance is of local manufacture. Nothing marine is
built here now save the tub that has to be built
here because it is too small to be imported. In
fact, a certain type of Australian would rather
be a homicide than encourage local industry ; ho
even imports dredges to avoid giving employment
to Australian workmen by having them composed
on the spot, though a dredge is about as fit for a
long voyage in tempestuous waters as is a ton of
loose scrap-iron, and the complete disappearance
in quick succession of two of these unhandy
craft and the drowning of all the folk
on board is a big bloodstain on somebody’s
memory. Australia has, so far, taken the disap-
pearance of its shipbuilding industry in a light
and friendly spirit. It got on well enough
without the vanished article. But now the situa-
tion is changed. Circumstances drive this country
to possess a navy, and if that navy is to be
efficient we must learn not only how to man
the ships but how to build them. There
is no record that any nation which' didn’t
know how to build its own ships ever amounted
to more than a row of pins in marine enterprise ; its
men were like Rodjestvenskv’s luckless crewsr—
mere ploughmen afloat in reach-me-down ships qn
an unfamiliar element. But there is no hope of
reviving this lost Australian art by the mere build-
ing of war vessels locally. It is an art that re-
quires to be pursued on a large scale, with ap
immense amount of costly plant; and, to make
the plant worth while, there has to be more
employment for it than Australia’s navy
is likely to supply for a very long
while. Australia must begin to build its
own big coasting vessels—vessels like the
Kyarra and Kanowna and Riverina—in its own
yards, so as to get its hand in, and to bring that
about a heavy duty on the imported ship is
essential. The business is not one which can be
built up under Freetrade conditions —it is ques-
tionable if it can even be kept alive under
Freetrade conditions after being built by the aid
of high Protection. At least this is Britain’s
recent record of new ships launched, and it isn’t a
cheering record: —
1900 1,828,343 tons
1907 .. .. .. .. 1,607,590 ~
1908 929,669 ~
1909 991,066 ~
1910 1,143,109 „
There is a sort of revival, but even then the posi-
tion isn’t encouraging. Certainly it doesn’t en-
courage Australia to try the restoration ,of its
ship-manufacture in Freetrade circumstances.
There has been Freetrade in ships for many years,
with unmitigated disaster as the sole result, and
there is no reason to expect that the future,
if the same conditions are maintained, will differ
in any way from the past. Why Freetrade in
ships should have been a tradition, even with
convinced Protectionists, nobody knows. It is a
foolish old tradition anyhow, and one that can’t
be too speedily abandoned.
Is the Unpaid Alderman Worth While?
The S. M. Herald lately took exception to the
N.S. W. Labor party’s municipal campaign, mainly
because it ‘‘proposes a new charge on the public
in the form of payment of mayors and aldermen
for services that aldermen have always been read-
ily available to perform for the distinction of the
office.” This musji have causer! the ingenuous
reader who takes his Herald seriously,
and yet has a just estimate of his local
alderman or councillor, to leap as though
a death adder had kicked him. It is
quite true that the services of mayors and
aldermen have always been available “ for the dis-
tinction of the office” ; but how have the services
been rendered ? Being unpaid, the Sydney subur-
ban alderman, for example, has always made an
appeal to the ratepayer that the ratepayer couldn’t
possibly be money in pocket by abolishing him.
So 40-odd municipalities have been maintained ;
and as these 40-odd haven’t been able to hit upon
any common scheme or course of action, chaos
has reigned. The slum evil has grown up
because the squabbl ng herd could not agree
on measures to check it. Also, the metropolis
has to share the profits of its electric trams with
the State at large, because on those terms alone
would the jealous municipalities agree to the
tram system being started. Its gas monopoly
would be in the hands of a Central Council —with
the resultant benefit of moderate-priced gas for
all—were it not that the unpaid councils and their
upholders oppose the Greater Sydney movement.
In a hundred other ways the evil of divided and
subdivided control shows itself; but always the
flimsy excuse is : How can it pay you to abolish
this or that council when the council is costing
you nothing? What Sydney needs, primarily, for
its municipal salvation is not two score of coun-
cils, as at present, but one. But whether it has
one or 40, the members should be paid, and paid
decently ; and then, if they were not earning
their money, there would be no compunction
about abolishing them. The old time amateur
legislator was bad, but the amateur municipal
councillor is worse. An amateur engine-driver or
deep sea pilot hasn’t more power than he has to
produce public disaster.

A Sample of Official Logic.
On the question whether bequests to charities in
Victoria should continue to be exempted from
probate duty, the Murray Government is seem-
ingly collecting illogical evidence with a view to
abolishing the exemption. For instance, Prout
Webb, the Commissioner of Taxes, has informed
Treasurer Watt that, whereas the existing law
“causes the State to lose revenue, it has not
brought any compensatory advantages in the
augmentation of charitable bequests.” For three
years the clause has been operating, yet there is
no increase in the total amount of money be-
queathed to charities, nor in the number of per-
sons addicted to post-mortem philanthropy. In
those three years the State “forfeited” only the
small sum of £2219 by exempting the bequests
from probate duty, says the Commissioner. There-
fore the Ministry, says Willik Watt, “ will be
compelled to consider whether it is worth persever-
ing with the exemption.” Between the argument
of Prout Webb and the summing up of W. Watt
there is nothing to choose in point of absurdity.
It is clear that, if the State forfeited £2OOO-oddof
probate duty, the charities gained that amount.
Also, it is evident that the State was spared a
little trouble in collecting an amount of money
which, had it been collected, would presumably
have had to be returned in the form of State
assistance to the charities thus benefited. Quite
apart from the reasonable supposition that post-
mortem philanthropy is encouraged bv exempting
it from probate duty (people who seek salvation,
by giving away what they can no longer make use
of, being naturally anxious that their charity
shall not be sweated) —apart from this theory,
there are the figures showing that the State under
the exemption law contributes on an average
£740 a year to charities without wasting a drop of
ink or spending a moment of trouble in the good
cause. So The Bulletin would ask where, in
the sacred name of Charity, is the necessity for
meddling with the present arrangement? Does
Treasurer Watt wish to benefit the Exchequer at
the expense of the hospitals ?
Concerning Eaked-Foods and Half-Baked
Tariffs.
On the recently-discussed question of eccentric
bread: —
I will discount my remarks at the outset by stating
that I am the local agent for one of those wicked Yankee
Bieakfast Foods, backed up by “ skilful Yankee adver-
tising puff,” against which The Bulletin's diatribe
(26/l/’ll) is launched.
Has The Bulletin anything to say against the whole-
some nature of these foods? If so, it can invoke our
excellent Pure Food Act to prohibit their importation.
A liberal measure of Protection for the local producer
is a just and patriotic policy, and the writer lias, for the
past 20 years, consistently advocated such a policy,
though apparently (only apparently, mind) against his
personal interests. And the local producer already has
what should be ample Protection. The duty on ready
cooked cereals is 20 per cent. This, with the freight
(heavy on account of their great bulk), insurance, ex-
change and landing charges represents a Protection of
from 40 to 60 per cent. The Bulletin may have exact
figures, if necessary. If the local man, with the best of
raw material at his hand, cannot compete with such a
measure of Protection as this, he had better go to plough-
ing wheat and quit trying to bake it.
That the Protection is ample is shown by the; fact that
tlie locally produced cereal, cooked or uncooked, is in-
variably sold far below the price of the imported article.
Take the single instance of oatmeal. The best Austra-
lian rolled oats are retailed for 6£d. per 21b. packet. The
price of the imported article is 9d. per 21b. packet. Yet
there are Australians who perversely buy and con-
sume tlie higher-priced imported meal, just as there are
other good Australians who celebrate any joyful occasion
in French champagne at three times the price of the Aus-
tralian tipple.
Americans of late years have Set the pace for nrany
tilings in Australia. Boots, hats, clothing, furniture,
machinery, printing, tlie drama, fiction and breakfast
foods. New York, rather than London, is rapidly be-
coming tlie Mecca to which the young- Australian turns.
“Yankee” breakfast foods have caught on in this
country, for the excellent reason that people like them.
Yet they are not used to anything like the extent The
Bulletin evidently supposes. The sale of the particular
food in which I am interested siiows that but one person
in 300 uses it, and then only sparingly. (The Bulletin
may have proof of this, if required.) Yet it is one of tlie
best known and advertised. We eat too much meat.
Personally, I welcome every newcomer in the field. It
means just that much additional interest aroused; just*
a few* more folk learning to use cereals in place of meat.
Americans are admittedly the exemplars in the pre-
paration and use of cereals. To prohibit them would
mean stagnation. It needs the stimulus of example and
competition to keep the trade alive. To admit them,
and at the same time tax them, means healthy competi-
tion with a consequent improvement in the local article,
while incidentally it increases the immediately available
revenue of the country.
By all means let us have a just measure of Protection
to give the local man a sjrow. But don’t protect him to
sucli an extent that he won’t have to put up a fight.
That would destroy him.
Also, the local agent for the Yankee bake shouldn’t
put a lock on his safe that will keep the burglar
out for certain. It will destroy him if he doesn’t
have to put up a fight with \V. Sikes now and
then. Americans, the Yankee bake agent re-
minds The Bulletin, have set the pace for many
things in Australia. Why? By letting in
the foreigner? Not much? By making the
foreigner go to America if he wanted American
trade. So, if the door is slammed hard enough in
the face of the Yankee baked-goods manufacturer,
and if the Australian trade is worth having, lie-
will come here and manufacture. If it isn’t worth
while to-day it will be to-morrow ; and it will pay
Australia to wait till to-morrow. That there are
a few tens of thousands of people who live
in Australia but won’t consume Australian
goods, even if they have to pay twice
as much for foreign goods, is true enough. The
remarks of the agent for the Yankee baked flour
really amount to a plea to be allowed to couie in
to cater for these people. This paper hasn’t
enough sympathy for these worst enemies of Aus
tnil'a to try to stop the tariff when it has hit them
with a2O per cent. duty. The person who lives
? n Australia and turns down Australian goods
because they are Australian, and buys the foreign
goods even if they are three times the price
can t be fought effectively with a 20 per cent.’
rose-water squirt. If a commandei were asked to
give facilities for the supply of food and news to
traitors in the camp, lie certainly wouldn’t meet
the request with that sort of weapon, no matter
how many specious yarns were whispered into his
ear.

On Putting Manure Pits in Parlors.
One of John Weary's numerous Boards is con-
sidering the question of shifting Melbourne’s
“noxious’’ trades—slaughteries, boiling-down-
eries, artificial manure factories, and the like •
and last week it got some wholesome truths
heaved at it. The chief heaver was Dr. Ch'Vs
McCarthy, now Health Officer of Braybrook
but formerly of Footscray. He had once, lie
said, got the late Bent to think over the removal
of the smelleries; but Dr. Morris, of the Board
of Health, had reported that the removal was
“inexpedient,” and that settled his effort.
McCarthy was no alarmist; he wouldn’t swear
that these trades affected the death-rate of the
district, but he was quite sure they affected the
health rate—which idea seems feasible. That the
fumes could be felt for over a mile was proved by
the state of the iron roofs in the vicinity; anil
when fumes attack iron they may possibly have
some effect on even an alderman’s stomach. He
recommended the shifting of the whole outfit-
cattle yards, abattoirs, manure works, boildown-
eries, etc., to Werribee (which, incidentally, is
rough on Werribee) ; and other witnesses, includ-
ing Byron Moore, Walter Hiqinbotham, and
Water Supply Commissioner Catanach backed him
up. It is an amazing thing that Melbourne has for
so long allowed the bad smells to stay on its door-
step and crowd its front room. The fact that
they have been there a long while is no reason for
allowing them to remain for ever. They are in
just the same position as the big squatter, who
must give way to population and hang always, so
to speak, on the outer skirt of civilisation. It
may be awkward for the man who runs the smell-
factory ; but the shifting process is one of the
risks of the business—and there isn’t any business
without a risk of some sort.
Adelaide City Council has resolved to let this
generation pay for the improvements it enjoys,
instead of sticking them on to posterity in the
shape of a loan. It is an odd coincidence that the
name of the Mayor, the special upholder of the
honest and anti-loan policy, is— Cohen. A man
with a name like that naturally knows what the
pawnshop habit leads to. Anyway, this energetic
person—who has broken even E. T. Smith’s old
record in the number of times he has held the
Mayoralty—has beaten down all opposition, and
got the rates raised by 3d., making 2s. in all.
This is still the lowest among the Australian
capitals, always excepting Melbourne, which
has about £lOO,OOO a year coming in from
rents. It does not challenge comparison with
Sydney's recent ninepenny jump, or with Bris-
bane’s startling total of 4s. 4d. Nevertheless,
the rich city property-owner (with his six votes
on municipal matters, in as many wards) is up in
arms already, and “Watchdog” writes to the
Register (3/2/11) clamoring for a “strong vigi-
lance committee” to be formed at once—to see
that this generation passes its liabilities on to
the next instead of paying cash.
T -« :
There is something almost pathetic in the pater-
nal proprietary interest manifested by the Kaiser
in “ Our Bertha,” the representative of the great
Essen Krupps. But Krupps, with all its im-
perially-implied aroma of patriotic service, is
essentially a private-enterprising, money-making
concern, as readily prepared and enthusiasti-
cally willing to furnish to the enemies of
Germany the implements of lethal warfare
(at a profitable figure) as to his Teutonic
Majesty himself, their own war-lord and racial
champion. It has been said that international
morality is a contradiction in essence as in terms.
The same may be said with equal correctness of
commercial morality, on the high plane of inter-
national obligation. Krupps, Vicars, Maxim,
Armstrong, and the rest of the world’s big
ordnance manufacturers, are virtual traitors to the
countries of their pretended allegiance. This
condition of things is, of course, largely the fault
of the various Governments concerned, which
should nationalise defence in the largest and
broadest sense, as the French have nationalised
defence in the State foundries of Creuzot. Left
to its own devices, Grease will chase the elusive
dollar even to the cannon’s mouth of the profit-
able enemy, and snatch dividends from the
legalised murderers of his own countrymen.
In the initiation of a national defence scheme, the
Commonwealth Government is acting with a right
conception of the spirit of nationhood by estab-
lishing State factories of small arms and ammuni-
tion rather than by subsidising private firms,,
whose plants might, sooner or later, be utilised,
by promptings for greed and profit, to supply the
military requirements of Australia’s enemies.

There is something suggestive of the digging up
of an old friend about the announcement that the
N.S.VV. Public Works Committee will proceed
next session to inquire into the advisability of
connecting Sydney with North Shore by bridge or
tunnel or both. Everybody knew 50 years ago
that the connection was required. It is only
necessary to look at the Private Enterprise ferry
service, the bailing up of the whole cart and van
traffic when the Private Enterprise punt breaks
down, and the wild, mad congestion at Circular
Quay, to know that it is now wanted worse than
ever. To start inquiring again into the advisa-
bility of building a bridge or tunnel is like a be-
lated inquiry, into the advisability of breathing.
The matter has already been inquired into till it is
tired and almostfrayed to death, and commissions
have recommended bridges and tunnels and
almost every other means of communication that
could be imagined except balloons. But it has
been with this as with the Sydney city railway.
Apparently, if a thing has been urgently requ.red
for a sufficient number of years, and has been in-
quired into oftener than anything else on earth,
and the habit of howling about the want of it has
been handed down like a precious heirloom from
generation to generation, it becomes practically
impossible to get it. It looks like sacrilege to
disturb the old grievance.

And all the world aflame !
This is no fight on narrow seas,
No battle on a plain ;
No more two little victories
For white mankind can gain
A century of jealous peace ;
The nations, full of hate,
To give the armies their release
Upon one bullet wait.
The golden threads of Finance hold
The round world in a net;
But flames will melt the yielding gold,
And he that is in debt
Will find how Credit comes to smash
When siege guns shake the Jew ;
And how a dazzling rifle flash
Licks up the I O U.
How long have we ? How many years
The battle line to form,
And fill the empty bandoliers?
The rumble of the storm
Is, heard! The sullen armies wait
The sudden shrill alarm !
Behold ! we sit at Asia’s gate,
And we have still to arm !
The nations for the Test prepare ;
A far I hear a shout:
These words Time’s scoring tombstones bear:
'‘Nil—Hands of Peace—Run Out.”
The crowd is still, likewise the band,;
The captains, white, perplexed,
A re hoping for a stubborn stand.
Australia goes in next l

covered with blue gum and ash; but the Government
threw open these forests to the persistent settler
—instead of forcing the western and other land
monopolists to unlock their lands —and the State
mine had to fall back upon such messmate and
stringy bark as remained. These handy supplies
were soon mopped up, and to-day the managers
have to go as far as Foster —away up at the end of
the southern line. Yet, in spite of the birth of
this new wood-eating giant, there is still no
genuine attempt at replacement. Here and there,
as in the Mornington Peninsula, the State has re-
planted a thousand acres or so; but what
are the}' in face of the enormous consumption ?
The Labor party is much more interested in this
matter than it seems to think. The cost of build-
ing and all other sorts of construction work has
been steadily moving up ; and “ this cursed Labor
legislation ” has to bear all the blame, whereas a
great deal of it ought to be borne by the increasing
cost of timber supplies. The rise in price of
other things gives Labor’s enemies a chance to
throw an undeserved brick at the party and the
movement; and the best way to avert the brick is
to destroy the pretext for throwing it.
One of Sydney’s most persistent skeletons was
dredged out of its cupbourd last week by a polite
wrangle between the Harbor Trust and the Orient
Co. ; after which a non-committal morning paper
repeated once more the vague statement that
something should be done about the congestion at
Circular Quay. Pretty well everyone has said
something equally indefinite at some time or
another; consequently the paper’s remark didn’t
give anyone a shock. Theempty repetition of the
obvious fact for even the 300,000 th time does not,
however, clear the sea or comfort the man who
knows that, in the event of his death in a ferry
accident, his wife would be compelled to open a
small boarding-house or get a job in one as cook.
Even the Harbor Trust sees that present con-
ditions are too much like a challenge to Provi-
dence ; but when the Trust starts to do a little
thing like limiting the size of the tenders that wait
on the big ocean passenger and cargo boats, the
shipping people rage furiously and want to know
whether the Commerce of the port is to be de-
stroyed. If a railway ran to Circular Quay, and if
it ran nowhere else, there might be some
sense in making this profound remark about the
destruction of Commerce. But, seeing that there
is no such virtue attached to Circular Quay, it
would be just as sensible to declare that the wool
and wheat businesses of the country would go to
pot if the wool and wheat trucks were not allowed
to come in and trample on the toes of the suburban
passenger traffic at the Central Railway Station.
The other day the Melbourne Argus noticed
that London Engineering had been considering
Australia’s railway systems (those amazing worms
which wander over vast unnecessary distances to
bring produce to a superfluous agent in a State
capital; which boast among them pretty nearly
all the different gauges under the sun ; and
which, in eight cases out of 10, ignore the short
and straight path to the nearest port in favor of
the roundabout one that may serve a political pur-
pose). Engineering decided that the only feasible
remedy was the federalisation of all the railways
of the Commonwealth. Whereupon, the Tory
journal delved into the pillbox where it keeps its
scientific knowledge, and declared that “all that
was wanted was a linking up of dead ends on the
borders, and facilities to settlers to send their pro-
duce to the nearest markets.” Also, it opined the
States could do the job much better than the
Commonwealth. But the Argus didn’t explain
why the States haven’t done these things already;
also it didn’t explain why, instead of producing
uniformity, they are just rushing into a borrowing
boom, and propose to spend tens of millions of
Cohen’s money in building more lines on at least
three different gauges; further, it didn’t explain
why, though the States might stop this mad border-
railway competition, they are spending hundreds
of thousands on building more border lines. As
the Argus says, no doubt the States could reduce
chaos to order ; the awkward fact it has to explain
away is that, instead of doing anything so sensible,
they are making chaos more chaotic, and doing
mad things that will eventually cost the country
millions to undo.

One of the clauses of Wade’s “ Coercion Act ”
prescribes various unpleasant penalties for “any
individual” who shall incite any body of men to
strike. Peter the Disappointed did this in the
Coal Strike, and was gaoled. Yet Peter didn’t
do much more than various State Fright papers are
doing in connection with the alleged “seeth-
ing discontent” in the Post Office. Sydney
Bloodstain has almost every day been printing
articles containing such remarks as these;
“ There can be no doubt but that the postal em-
ployees have just cause for complaint right
throughout the Commonwealth ” ; and “a strike
would appear inevitable ” ; and “ there have been
strikes before to-day in which the men concerned
have had much less to complain of than the postal
officials have in the present matter.” Likewise:
“To-day Mr. So-and-So waits on theP.M.G. to
discuss the grievances of the men, and it is freely
whispered that unlesssome satisfactory settlement
is arrived at the men will be advised to come out.”
These remarks may not be intended to induce the
Commonwealth’s employees to strike. But when
a mischievous small boy has a grudge against
some other youngster who has walked off with
his best girl, and fools with a pea-rifle, and
has the misfortune to pull the trigger while the
gun is pointed at'the other small boy who lias cap-
tured the girl—well, the small fool-boy who plays
with the weapon, and does the damage, is liable
to get a whipping, no mattter how loudly he may
howl that his intentions were strictly honorable.
When S. J. Mitchell, Government Resident in
the Northern Territory, read the Proclamation
declaring that the backward infant had been
favored with a change of nurses, the usual flag-
hoisting was included in the ceremony. A brand-
new Australian flag had been produced for the
occasion; and when Crush, late M.P. for the
Province in the S. Aus. Assembly, smelt round, he
discovered that the drapery provided for the occa-
sion had been pieced together in a Chinese
tailory ! Further, Crush discovered that, in the
time available, there wasn’t a hope of getting any
other flag of Australia that wasn’t the work of
China. However, he rushed round, and finally
raked out of a coasting boat an old piece of bunt-
ing that was alleged to be “white, and this
was the flag that was used. But Crush’s victory
was short-lived, for it seems that that flag, t<x>,
came out of a Chinese shop 15 years or so ago. in
fact, it is hard to get hold of anything ip
Port Darwin that hasn’t the yellow brand
upon it. According to all the rules laid down by
B. Smith and other pro-niggers and pro-any tning-
except-whites, the Territory ought by this time to
be consequently overflowing with prosperity and
riches ; but somehow the rules of B. Smith fall to
ruins when they are told to get to work.

“ The Whip,” now in its eighth week at
Her Majesty’s (Sydney) bids fair to be the most
persistent horse drama Australia lias yet seen.
Yet no one would swear recklessly that it is the
best of its kind, except, perhaps, in the matter of
the mounting and appurtenances. Perhaps a sort
of special and pathetic interest or halo or sunset
radiance begins to attach to the horse as a doomed
animal which the motor-car is chasing to its grave,
and the public may, for this reason, be prepared for
a recrudescence of it on the stage. It may, in fact,
be sitting up in the shafts of the cab and singing
its swan song into its nosebag, and the community
may be moved to tears without knowing it.

Time and space do not prevail against
“ Miss Gibbs,” who still holds her own at Sydney
Royal. There is on record a certain vague state-
ment by a prophet who saw Death riding on a
pale horse while Sheol followed after carrying the
luggage. Probably when the day of that great
event comes, Miss Gibbs will walk behind, and
shove Sheol along:, by way of finishing the proces-
sion. Her durability certainly suggests that she
will be around in one capacity or another.

At the Palace Hugh Ward is doing “Seven
Days,” not for riotous behavior, at the Sydney
Stadium, but because his Japanese cook has the
chicken-pox ; and he is serving his sentence with
so much success that the term is bound to be ex-
tended on account of good behavior.
* * * *
The trouble begins when Tubby McGirk
(H. H. Wallace), a burglar, forces the door and
enters James Wilson’s house in semi-darkness.
He hides behind a screen and listens to Jantes
Wilson (Hugh Ward) telling his friend Dallas
Brown (Aubrey Mallalieu) about his loneliness
since he got a divorce a y6ar ago. Dal suggests
that he propose to Kitty McNair, who takes him
on a trial engagement. At about this point
Jim receives a telegram from Aunt Selina (who
“ is sure she would have been arrested if she had
only stuck to the Cause for a few weeks more ”)
breaking the news that he may expect her that
evening. Auntie, who belihves that Hades is com-
posed of spirits, low-necked gowns and divorces,
knows nothing of the matrimonial smash ; and,
to hide the knowledge from her, Kit consents to
act as Wilson’s wife while auntie is around.
Belle Knowles, Wilson’s divorced wife, “hap-
pens to be passing,” and thinking that no
one is at home, drops in ; and when she finds
her mistake, says she has called to see the cook.
Tom Harbison (Reginald Wykeham) Kit’s real
lover, likewise calls, and is naturally upset at
Kit’s sudden marriage to James. It is just here
that the Japanese cook breaks out with chicken-
pox, which is mistaken for small-pox, and the
house is quarantined. Thus James, Kit, Dal,
Selina, Kit’s real young man, Dal’s wife and
various other people are all quarantined in the
same house, with the usual complicated results.
Aunt Selina takes charge, and the others have to
draw lots for positions, with the result that
Flannigan (who represents the Law) becomes
chambermaid, while Jim wins the lady’s maid
ticket in the sweep. Kit’s triumph in the
cookery department is an omelet, which
James unfortunately mistakes for a linseed
poultice. Finally, everybody takes to the roof,
whence James “pots” reporters and photo-
graphers (he counts 19 dead ones); and Dal dis-
covers that the cook has only got chicken-pox ;
and the house is unquarantined, and the 12-
inouths’-old divorce is shoo’d off the premises.
* * * *
The farce might have been built for Hugh
Ward and his bright company. Celia Ghiloni, as
Aunt Selina, and Maud Chetwynd, as Mrs. Brown,
who believes in spooks, have the broad comedy
parts which win the easiest laugh. Mrs. Brown
has her spookish triumphs. She is sure she saw
the screen move about, and commands it to move
along, which it accordingly does—the burglar being
behind it. Another time she sees the table jump,
and she commands it to go on jumping. Tubby
being concealed thereunder, it naturally obeys.
Miss Palotta’s artlessness as Kit helps out the
general conspiracy. The plot covers seven days,
and at the end the audience wishes that Hugh
Ward had killed “ Snowy ” Baker and been con-
demned to make it seven months. Seven days
pass much too quickly.

“Tom Jones” is rollicking through his
final fortnight at Sydney Criterion, and German’s
fine music will be turned off by Musical Director
Victor Champion about 11 p.m. on Friday, 17th,
to make way for a week’s revival of “ Miss Hook
of Holland.” Comedian Cromwell is to sail shortly
for England; and the tuneful play, with its
setting of Dutch round cheeses, is being put on
specially to allow the popular jester seven farewell
appearances as Slinks, the nervous loafer, who,
having accidentally picked up the recipe for
Hook’s famous liqueur, endeavors to pass the
dangerous treasure on to Miss Hook’s handsome
but poor bandmaster-lover —whom he doesn’t
know to speak to. Slinks’s panic-stricken but
impudent method of introducing himself to the
haughty stranger is a delicious bit ot comedy :
“ Excuse me, sir, but I’ve lived about these parts
all my life and I know all the local gossip ! ” If
anyone neglects to hear Cromwell deliver that
speech it will be his own dull funeral.

One of the cheerful features of football by
dogs, as played at Sydney Tivoli, is that the
players also provide the barracking. The bull-
voice of the blackguard who roars for a brick or a
picket is replaced by the shrill, excited yapping_of
the bounding dogs as they leap at the ball swing-
ing from the wire, which runs from goal to goal.
Not for long years has the Religious Editor heard
barracking that was so devoid of bad language
and brutal expressions, or made one of a crowd
that was so genuinely amused. No church foot-
ball team could ever hope to equal the field-
deportment of Velanche’s Dogs. Years ago, on a
ground which was interrupted considerably by
spreading gum-trees, a church team used to rage
and perspire. A sudden yell of “ Git to'em I”
calls up to the Religious Editor’s mind a vision of
the St. Basher’s team in action. Picture a num-
ber of striped and snorting hangmen rushing
from the horizon and jumping on one another’s
faces. They are all extinct now, and serve them
right; but to this day hundreds of people speak
respectfully of the dashing and refined football of
that wild but sainted horde. No doubt when we
are less barbaric than at present football will be
played entirely by teams of trained dogs. Wild,
Willie and West, Miss Yetta, Ethel Loftus, the
Pounds girls and Baby Watson supply the other
turns over which no shadaw of last nights is cast
by the advertisement. Julian Rose’s season is to
conclude about the 17th ; and the Blessings and
Frank Harwood are thinking of packing up.

Both of Sydney’s leading picture firms are
coruscating these nights. And both houses,
Glaciarium and Lyceum, are showing the “ Battle
of Houndsditch ’’ in whatever luridness it pos-
sesses. West’s people have a humorous touch
in their advertisement, wherein close details
are given, including “The Active Firing.
The Desperate Shooting By Thk Dastardly
Assassins.” These anarchists, whatever they
Inny have been, were not dastards. At least
they had the saving grace of courage. On Thurs-
day night next Spencer will show at the Lyceum
“Captain Midnight, the Bush King,” a bush-
ranging drama acted for the cinematograph by
Miss Lily Dampier, Alfred Rolfe and a selected co.
And, as everybody knows, Spencer’s films are
always at the high-water mark of quality. West’s
Pictures are among the nature-worshippers.
There the star item is “The Call of the Surf,”
which is further enhanced by the portraits of the
prettiest of the Sydney surf sirens, photographed
specially for cinematograph purposes.

“The Gay Grisette,” happening for the
first time at Melbourne .Royal on a very hot
Saturday night, kept the principals steadily en-
gaged in mopping heat drops from their brows.
It was hard work. The libretto has the character
of an inferior sausage, being stuffed with plot-and-
nonsense of the crudest kind. Twenty or more musi-
cal numbers, with incidental dances, are crowded
into this same libretto, and the performers, with
a superabundance of poor stuff to get through,
seem to be bolting their food, as a rule, because
it isn’t worth chewing. There are exceptions,
of course. Frank Lanby’s song, “Captain
Ginger,” which comes late in the show and needs
to be promoted to the first act, is a very bright
item. Two or three of Miss Florence Imeson’s
songs (one has a capital male chorus to support it)
and a children’s sextet, in the second act, also
stand out from a chaos of recollections of “ The
Gay Grisette.” And the foolishness of its crowded
The umpire who no-balled Pitcher evidently
meant he was not a pitcher within the meaning of
the act. Anyway no wise umpire could no-ball
or discount D.C.L. as a stimulant of the highest
merit in inducing enterprise and brilliancy of
effort. The best averages and biggest scores on
Life’s, wicket are made by bowlers and hitters in-
spired to their topmost pitch of capacity by

plot has at least the merit of audacity. The lady
with a blackened face prances into the proceed-
ings like a reminiscence of a cake-walk. When
she is introduced as a cannibal African queen from
Capetown, the absurdity of the idea is almost
humorous.
* *
In this “ musical frivolity,” one’s first im-
pressions of ‘‘The Gay Gordons” Co. are con-
firmed. Frank Lincoln, Miss lineson and Miss
Finnis (as the German spy girl) are active and in-
telligent comedians, who act better than they
warble and have no strength of personality.
Frank Danby is a chirpy dramatic humorist, and
Fred Winn a sufficiently genial funny man. Miss
Cozens (as the colored lady) has an angular style
and a buoyant spirit. Among the others nobody
gets a chance to wear a garland of praise, though
some of them have plenty to do. The chorus
work ranges from good to admirable, the orchestra
under Albert Vernon gets every available ounce
out of the uneven music, and Goatcher’s two
backgrounds are the most soothing features of the
entertainment.
** * *
“ My Mate,” the latest Australian drama,
at the King’s, is a thin, heavy-eyed play which
begins with love in a bushland scene, and hops
and skips to a familiar conclusion. Its chief mis-
creant, Ralph Seymour, is little more than a faint
and fleeting dramatic chimera. The first time he
appears he is spurned and expelled by an honor-
able company of cocky farmers. The next time
he is shot for attempted assassination. In this
way all interest is destroyed in the vicious and the
plain, and the eye is fixed on the virtuous and the
beautiful. The latter department is in charge of
Melton and Fernleigh, who own a big selection.
They are both in love with the same young
woman, who has been created according to a com-
mon formula. She is fearfully proper, and never
permits her tongue to misbehave, while they are
exceptionally modest, and would put their
thoughts in petticoats if they could. But, unfor-
tunately, with all their moral perfection, they do
not make the genuine appeal.
-* * * *
Some comic-relief policemen and a nigger
have been introduced to provide a little action
and some odd sensations. The sensations, though
unsurprising, come as a blessed relief to the
severe inertia of the opening act, where nothing
happens at all, and nothing is heard but colorless
English, Happily the acting partially expiates
that piece of feebleness. Roy Redgrave and
Harry Sweeney play the parts Of the two sworn
mates like thoroughly-respectable English gentle-
men. When they stroll on in the first act, they
look especially like the products of those exclus-
ive academics where theology and table manners
are taught. Ned Duggan orates as the heavy
father, and his wife (Miss Lillie Bryer) occasion-
ally adds a soprano obligato. Miss Olive Wilton
is an amiable Jessie Moreland, and Bert Bailey
deserves honorable mention among those who
also speak. J. H. Nunn and Temple Harrison
are ordinary bobbies; Max Clifton is a wily
aboriginal; and Beckett sneers but once as the
villain Seymour. Miss Duggan tries to portray a
girlish heroine, sweet like the odor of the rose or
the dew of the morning. To say the least about
it, her heroine is not girlish looking.

When “The Luck of Roaring Camp ” was
staged in Sydney •by George Marlow, Ltd., a
year ago. The Bulletin remarked that the bellow-
drama had taken the name of Bret Harte’s novel
in vain. Probably the audience at Melb. Prin-
cess’s last Saturday didn’t seek for Bret Harte’s
story in the drama that wore its title, but was
merely looking for a mining camp and listening for
roars. In which case the audience’s expectations
were fulfilled. The mine, located in America,
provides Diver with lurid opportunities in the
way of murder and false accusation; but he is
ultimately brought to grief by a hero who wins
the girl and secures the property, and, in fact,
gets the Luck. Many things, including some
stirring episodes of comic relief, happen before
the ends of poetic justice are served. If the
people who goto the Princess’s are fond of this
sort of melodrama, this is the sort of melodrama
which should suit them down to the ground and
up to the roof.

The panto at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne)
is the same enormous success as usual, except
on the warmest nights, when it loses a trifle
of its enormity. Also, the performance has
always been as usual, save on one matinee
occasion, when pretty Miss Arundale took an
afternoon off, and another lady slew the Giant
in her stead. The emergency Jack was the
lady who at other times is the Fairy Queen, her
magic wand being entrusted for this occasion to
an angel from the chorus.

At the Opera House the programme was
handsomely refurnished and decorated on Satur-
day. The Six American Dancers, new to Mel-
bourne, are not more skilful in their rhythmical
step dancing than picturesque in the manner of
their turn. They get good effects with their feet,
their costumes and their organisation, and their
performance has a charm of its own. A new sketch
by Cooper and Lait presents the masculine
member of the firm in a striking resemblance
to Hugh Ward. Cooper was suggestive of Hugh
J.W. in the previous farce; but now he is mOre like
him than H. J". Ward is like himself; whilst Mabel
Lait adds a touch of naturalness in her acting to
her physical endowments. Fasola the Fakir is
keeping his end up by means of the Lady and
the Lion, which is somehow a less impressive
illusion than it ought to be. The Lady is put into a

Tait’s Melbourne picture-programme is
packed with various dramatic and comic inven-
tions. One of the principal pictures this week
illustrates the capers of a French comedian
yielding to a cruel hypnotic suggestion.
“The Foreman,-” a Yankee story, instils
into the beholder the heavenly essence of
Dead wood Dick. “An Attack on Fort
Ridgely” keeps one thinking of the brindled
romance in “The Squaw Man ” play. The tragic
touch is supplied by the film showing the micro-
scopic studies of certain foods. Here the gourmet
will see the aquarium he swallows with his vinegar
and the menagerie he eats with his cheese.

At Melbourne Olympia there is just now a
very good scen e study showing the busy life
along the German River Elbe. There is
some home-made pathos about “Sunshine Sue,”
wherein a girl surrenders to the beguilements of
the usual handsome stranger. There are some
further thrills in “Value Beyond Price,” which
contains some allusions to the pawnshop trade.
As for “ Tweedledum’s Tragic Part,” it pictures
such a state of riot that it can be shortly described
as a flashlight of Chaos.

Adelaide, which takes its pantomimes
when it can get them, is duly grateful to William
Anderson for an early view of Liddiard’s Lilli-
putians. • “ The Old Woman ”is not great, but it
is satisfying, and some of the youngsters should
have a future. New songs have been dropped in
for the second week. The Johnson v. Jeffries
controversy has been worked out nightly at the
Town Hall. It is a harmless and even soothing
film, and all wowserish anticipations of the evil it
was to do have apparently been forgotten. This
fighting at second-hand is a feeble game. The ab-
sence of noise alone renders it unlike any ring-side
one has ever seen. There ought tobea lot of money
in a fight-for-exhibition ; but it would need to be
one in which the men stood off and sparred,
and never hugged or pushed or rested on each
other’s breast. There should be at least two
knock-downs every round, and the man eventually
beaten should go over backwards —not slip down
as if he were tired. West’s and the Empire have
each rushed off the mail steamer and on to the
stage certain films of what they call “ The Anar-
chists’ Last Stand,” in East End, London, a month
ago. The Tivoli has lost Miss Odeyne Spark, of
the Parisian manners and the London voice; popu-
lar as she made herself, she would have the audi-
ence join in the chorus —and Adelaide crowds
(unless in an occasional holiday after-dinner mood)
simply hate being dragooned into doing that.
Travers and Cuzco, newcomers to Australia,
present a turn more familiar in the circus than on
the stage. They do some clever hat-spinning, and
introduce a monkey, also a high-jumping dog,
which clears all obstacles with the ease of a rich
motorist surmounting an Act of Parliament. Miss
Jjucia Collins is presenting her mother’s old suc-
cess, “The Little Widow.” The familiar change
from the demure to the devilish, from black outer
clothing to scarlet under-ditto, is brilliantly done.
At last week’s meeting of the Melbourne
Tramway Co. the chairman announced thait
the charter granted to the co. by the Gillies-
Deakin Government of old was an even more in-
iquitous contract than was supposed at the time,
and has been generally considered since. The
concession of penny sections to the travelling
public used to be talked of as an inevitable result
of the Tramway Co.’s prosperity. It was under-
stood to be practically bound to come in time,
according to the. charter; but the chairman last
week congratulated his brother shareholders on
the fact that “the directors have had the oppor-
tunity of informing the Royal Commission that
Parliament cannot impose one penny without
breaking the contract upon which the enterprise ions
started , which, would, under the Act, involve
compensation to the company.” In short, the
Gillies-Deakin Parliament gave the public no
chance of getting the reduction of fares which was
vaguely promised ; and the company which ac-
quired this impregnable monopoly speaks of itself
nowadays as an “ enterprise.” An enterprise !
Yet perhaps the chairman is right—it depends
upon the point of View. The dictionary says an
enterprise is “ a bold or dangerous undertaking.”
AT POVERTY POINT.
“One Who Pays”: Pietistic drama again in “The
Christian ! ” Not so bad as “ The Sign of the Cross,”
hut deformed by the mawkish ; and femininity is brought
in too large. Piety must always have something to do
with a gal. She is the backbone in its drama—except in
such an admirable play as “ The Hypocrites,” which pos-
sesses the only real clergyman on the stage. John Storm,
in “ The Christian,” is a daub out of a mediaeval church
window, before Art was Art—akin to the Kev. Julian
Gray in “The New Magdalen,” and the Kev. Marcus
Superbus. A sort of foolometer in the reading world is
the degree of your admiration for Hall Caine and Marie
Corelli. The lady’s “Barabbas” is worse than Caine’s
foolery ; yet she is a better artist than Caine. She is
driven by a kind of baleful Sibylline inspiration, whereas
Caine has to flog it up. I set him doyfn as the worst im-
postor among readable novelists. -
Shortly promised, a dramatic hash of “The Sorrows of
Satan.” Anderson, it is said, is behind the production,
and will stage it in Melbourne regardless of expense and
everything else. *
“Harrison O.” : The decentralisation of Melbourne’s
amusement factories continues. A few years ago the
Yarra city’s theatrical district was bounded by Bourke,
Exhibition and Spring streets. Then Fitzgerald started
a show’ on the other side of Princes Bridge, where
West’s, Wirth’s and others have established their head-
quarters. Then the St. Hilda boom set in. Next, the
Lyric Theatre was opened in the busy suburb of P’ran.
Now another suburban theatre is promised, this time in
Brunswick, where a shindykit has secured a piece of the
universe in Sydney-road. It is intended to erect a
theatre capable of holding 2500 blokes, persons ahd
princes, and as a decent stage is to be built, musical
plays and the legitimate drammer will be exploited, as
well as the inevitable pictures.
“Theorbo ”: The Melba-Williamson undertaking is the
largest in our history. I reallybelieve that artistic con-
siderations enter, apart from money-making. William-
son has somewhat of the spirit of Lyster, who said : “ My
passion is grand opera.” Lyster did well; and he did
much. Try to cramp some of his repertoire into the
least space : “ Aida,” “ Africans,” “Bohemian Girl,”.
“Borgia,” “ Barbiere,” “ Belisario,” “Carmen,” “Crjs-
pino,” “Dinorah,” “ Ebreo," “ Elisir d’Amore,” “ Er-
nani,” “Fra Diavolo,” “ Freischutz,” “Faust,” “ Gua-
rany," “Giovanni," “Huguenots,” “lone,” “Juive,”
“Lohengrin,” “Lurline,” “Lucia,” “Louisa Miller,”
“ Linda diOhamounix,” “ Martha,” “ Maritana,” “ Most,”
“ Marriage of Figaro,” “ Maschera,” “ Macbeth ” (Verdi),
“Norma,” “Oberon,” “ Pasquale,” “Pipele,” “Pro-
phete,” “ Puritani,” “ Rigoletto,” “Rose of Castile,”
“ Robert le Diable,” “ Semiramide,” “Secret Marriage”
(Cimarosa), “Satanella,” “ Sonnambula,” “Sicilian Ves-
pers,” “ Traviata,” “ Trovatore.” Were those barbarous
times? To be sure, hardly one of the representations
would be a patch on what Melba and Williamson will
give ; but look at the range, look at the education ! The
best thing Melba can do will be to inspire us with a crav-
ing for the whole range of grand opera, by Australian
performers, with a cheap orchestra, and any kind of
scenery and costuming, at 35., 2s. and Is.
“ R. 8.” : Went to the Maori Village at The Bulletin’s
old favorite spot, Clontarf, and was pleased and saddened
and charmed and bored. Maggie Papakura is a “ high-
brow announcer,” as the Thirty Seventh-street and Broad-
way district has it; and Bella is a dramatic and vivid
dancer, loaded with a cheerful, unabashed devilment,
excellent to meet in a world of mostly hypocrites ; and
the girl Iwa sings Alfred Hill’s “Waiata Poi ” songs
finely; and the poi dances and the hakas and the titi
torea and the canoe poi dance are good enough to carry
the crowd triumphantly all the world over, hav-
ing all the primitiveness and the wild energy of
youth for which a tired human nature pays
fancy prices. But English glees, and “ Barbara
Allan,” and tripe music on large brass instruments of
torture serve only to show the more-than-passable choir
as a collection of clever monkeys, which they are not.
There is plenty of music—his own music—in the Maori ;
and Alfred Hill has the key to most of it. The manage-
ment should engage him to score a full programme of
Maori melody, and cut out “ Barbara Allan ” and that
dreary and only partially truthful ditty, “ Home, Sweet
Home.”
The Pat.he pictures of “Australia at Work,” touring
under the guidance of M. P. Adams, have already been
shown at 140 orie-night stands in Victoria, and before the
year’s tour is completed they will be sheeted home to the
understanding of another 170 townships—say 300 in all.
Everywhere the pictures of local industries seem to strike
the audience as good arguments for Protection against
foreign goods ; but as regards Protection against
foreign arms the patriotism of the up-country
farmer is a negligible quantity. Fine pictures
of the pioneer vessels of the Australian Fleet
entering Hobson’s Bay, and of an inspection of
troops incidental to that stirring occasion, somehow fail
to stir the cocky farmer to a handclap. He remains
deeply uninterested in the arrival of the Yarra and the
Parramatta. They are presented*to the accompaniment
of Australian patriotic airs, but the sons of the soil sit
unmoved. Their imagination doesn’t run to the possi-
bility of a detachment of little brown Japs patrolling
their district, whilst the officer in command jots down all
particulars of the properties in a new Domesday Book.
“Harrison O.” : “S.S.” is right (B. 19/l/’ll) when he
says that most of the smartest acrobatic turns are the
work of “foreign devils”; but he was unfortunate in
going to the Pantzers for proof. The senior Pantzer is a
foreigner who has lived all his life in the Land of the Sky-
scraper and the Doubtful Sausage; but the other three
members of the troupe are natives respectively of N’Yark,
Newcastle (Eng.) and London. The two kids, or Pant-
zerettes, are English.
“ Klifton ”: The feature of Barnold’s animal turn that
knocks the crowd hardest is Dan’s lip-licking business
each time he emerges from the pub. And yet there is
nothing in it. Daniel licks his lips because mutton fat
has been smeared on them. The most unintelligent,
untrained hound might be relied on to do likewise in the
circumstances.
“ H.S.” : A difficult point to resolve in connection with
the theatrical business is why a musical comedy, which
is taken off, and, after a few weeks, revived, invariably
slumps—and that, regardless of the fact that it was
booming: when the end came. Take the recent case of
“The Arcadians.” When Clarke and Mevnell, shifted
their fine show from Sydney to Melbourne, it was going
great guns. Doody and his associates came back to the
Cri. last month, in no wise less alluring or diverting than
of yore, and lo ! they found themselves neglected; so
that the management was driven to a change of bill. It
is the same with musical comedies, seemingly, as it is
with whiskies. If the public gets out of the habit of
patronising any given brand, it is parlously hard to lure
them back to it.
There is a growing London custom of specialising in
Christmas prices for children apart from pantomimes.
“Peter Pan” is revived every year; so is “Alice in
Wonderland”; Maeterlinck’s “Blue Bird” was back
again this Christinas, and a new version of Anste3’’s
“Vice Versa.” Even “Charley’s Aunt” was making
its fifth consecutive annual appearance. Also, “The
Arcadians” was given nine times in Christmas week, and
incidentally reached its 600 h performance.
Septimus Lawson, Mus. Bac., who died in the Kiama
(N.S. YV.) Cottage Hospital on Sunday, aged 77, was
organist at St. Paul’s Cathedral, Liverpool, and conductor
of the Philharmonic Society in that cit3 r before coming
to Australia in 1887. Right to the time of his death he
had been making a crust in the country township as
a teacher of music and voice production.
Baritone Arthur Crane, lately of the “Madame Butter-
fly ”Opera Co., has settled down in Brisbane as a teacher.
Holland and St. John have now settled down comfort-
ably to the belief that a Brisbane music-hall can go on
for ever. Holland, after giving the place a sir years’ trial
—a reasonable time for anv trial to last—arranged for a
long lease of a new theatre, the Empire, which was
finished and opened on Jan. 14. Apparently, the Bris-
bane firm is working on its own ; but 11. Rickards seems
to have a disposition towards it, wherefore
the latest bills include—“ Lydia-Yeamans Titus, the
dainty, delightful society entertainer —by arrangement
with H. Rickards, Esq.” The one-theatre or one-hall
firm has a preMv hard row to hoe, especially if it wants to
turn up an occasional star; but if E. Holland can
arrange with H. Rickards, and H. Rickards can now and
then arrange with E. Holland, it ought to be good for
the health of both of them.
“ Sr” : Sam Elton, the plate juggler in the Beans Talk
panto., has the stage to himself for 15 minutes whilst he
dashes about the boards with k thousand (or so) plates.
Moreover, he is billed as a large star and the only cove
who ever tickled the Shah. Yet I haven’t the least doubt
we-see every week of our lives just as wonderful plate-
carriers who don’t get starred at all and wouldn't tickle
the Shah worth tuppence. One girl at my cafd serves 25
diners simultaneously—most of them hurried, impolite,
hungry chewers. Then she has not anything like a clear
run for her mone3’. She has to dodge a screen in front of
the kitchen, sidestep a dozen other girls rushing to the
kitchen with orders, get behind tables that are almost as
near to one another as the new Siamese twins, remember
who ordered the “ Irish ” and who takes the fisja without
sauce, and pick up fresh orders on the way without pour-
ing soup down the crack between anybody’s neck and his
collar. It is a star turn, and the girl who does it earns
about .01069 of Sam’s salary.

“ Harrison O.” : The offices of our “ great ” dailies are
not the only places where public opinion is manufactured.
There is the theatre. By a bit of judicious bluff audi-
ences are often persuaded that a first night failure has
been a howling success. At a first-night performance in
a Melbourne playhouse recently when the final curtain
dropped there was a tremendous outburst of silence.
The cloth was raised to disclose the principals bowing
their acknowledgments of the cheering which hadn’t
happened. They again lifted and lowered the curtain,
and the ushers at the back of the dress-circle applauded
enthusiastically. A third time the rag was dropped and
hauled up; and the principals kept on bowing. Then,
evidently under the impression that they were perform-
ing a difficult acrobatic feat, a man in the stalls raised a
cheer, and it was taken up by five other misguided
persons. And still the curtain kept on rising and falling.
After it had been elevated for about the eighth time
everybody who had not managed to get outside was
applauding vigorously ; so that on Monday morning the
dailies were able to announce that another insult to the
intelligence of Melbourne had met with an “enthusiastic
reception.”
Australia, plodding around with its muddy
gamp in its hand, and its damp tail drag-
ging behind, will be pleased to recall that
this country is now right in the middle of
Wragge’s great drought. Wragge apparently
had a cycle theory, but the weather is a feckless
beast and has a reprehensible habit of leaving
prophets in the lurch.
Melbourne builders had a busy time of it
during the hustling year 1910 —the year of bust-up
and revolution which saw the return to power of
three Labor Governments. During the 12 months
Caulfield rushed up 352 new shacks. Brunswick,
the other side of Melbourne, accounted for 349.
Prahran built 313. Records of 2824 new houses
and shops in important suburbs are also to be
found in the municipal books, and there is an air
of prosperity in the building world—all of which
goes to show how bitter and black is the Labor
blight which has spread over this blasted country.
Labor, when it comes to disturbing the placid
course of events, is a fair devil, and no error !
Lonsdale, M.L.A., the preachy Wadeite
representative for Armidale (N.S.W.), who has
been a single-tax joss for some years, has been
battered in the single-tax paper. It says that on
outside platforms, the regrettable Lonsdale de-
nounces monopolists, delivers mighty speeches on
the taxation of land values, and advocates the
complete Government absorption of all unearned
increments; yet in Parliament he sits “shoulder
to shoulder with the identical conservatism that
he so ably and vigorously denounces.” Parsons,
the writer, then shows that Lonsdale supports the
crowd which demands that Crown leaseholders
should be allowed to convert their leaseholds to
freehold ; in fact, he supports tlite crowd which
hopes to get back to power bv opposing the lease-
hold policy of the McGoweri-Nielsen Government,
yet that is the very policy that Lonsdale barracks
for when he is talking to his single-axe friends.
A tortured landowner writes in agony to
the Melbourne Argus. “ What an army of clerks
it will take to check all these land-tax returns,
paid for by the unfortunate taxpayers! ” he
groans. Of course, and it’s the same with the
brutal income-tax, and the bestial dog-tax, and
the pestiferous excises on tobacco and whisky.
And on the night of December 31 the writer was
passing the bank which keeps his overdraft, when
he saw lights inside. Suspecting that a burglar
was tampering with the I 0 TJ, he pushed his way
in, and saw an army of clerks busy reckoning up
interest on overdrafts. Naturally, he said : “This
is a shocking waste of time,’’and at once urged
the boss to drive the clerks home, and let the
interest on the overdraft slide. And the boss
wouldn't!
The most humorous thing about the recent
N.S.W. municipal elections was the triumphant
“ cock-a-doodle-doo” of the collective Tory fowl
over the result. The fact that Labor, in its first
effort in municipal politics, didn’t win every-
where was sufficient. Ex-Premier Wade, S. M.
Herald, Telegraph and the rest rose and rap-
turously pointed out that “ Labor had passed its
zenith, and was obviously on its decline”; also,
that “the public had awakened from its dream,
and was coming around again to the sphere
of practical politics”—not to mention that
“ the public reaction against caucus methods was
now unmistakable.” Seeing that, outside the
city of Sydney, the municipal franchise is still to
a large extent a propputy franchise, and that the
total municipal enrolment is just about 5 per cent,
of the total adult enrolment—remembering these
small items, inter alia, a municipal election is
about as indicative of public opinion as a “ shop ”
egg is representative of a zoo.
Private Enterprise, in the shape of the
Melbourne Tramway Co., has been having dis-
cussions with its friend the Argus as to the
desirability of running a tram or two through
the night, it having dawned on the Tory paper
that such a service would fill a long-felt want.
The co. first remarked that a cable system doesn’t
lend itself to casual traffic like that, and the cost
would be prohibitive—which is doubtless a fact.
Thereupon the paper suggested horse-cars; to
which the co. replied that its horse-lines to Kew
and Hawthorn were losing propositions, and it
didn’t feel inclined to throw away any more cash.
Also, it averred that its Act fixed the hours during
which it must carry on traffic, and any variation
would be a breach of contract, and so forth. So
Melbourne’s antediluvian transport arrangements
are likely to remain as they are till 1910, and the
intervening years will give the Argus and other
citizens a further taste of the folly of handing over
public services to Private Enterprise.
A bunch of brave Melbourne boys of the
blackleg breed lately took on the job of unloading
the Arawatta and Marloo, berthed in the Yarra.
The well-plucked ’uns were clerks employed by
the A.U.S.N. Co., and they did what they did in
response to a “call upon their loyalty.” This
“loyalty ” sounds very well; but there’s probably
something more in the matter. It is understood
that the clerks went in a body—all the clerks in the
office who were asked to go ; and unless this lot of
clerks is a most unusual lot, the conclusion that
one can’t dodge is that the youths took the other
fellows’ job because they wanted to keep their
own. In that case the “ loyalty ” boils down to a
desperate struggle on the part of the clerks to
hang on to their 30-bob a week ; with the further
probability that, if they didn’t hate their job be-
fore, they do now. This is the “loyalty” of the
animal which does the circus trick under the
trainer’s whip—and, when the time comes, rends
the trainer with a fury proportioned to the bite of
the lash. Still there is something to be said for
the circus man—he isn’t fool enough to advertise
that his animal’s docile behavior is due to
“loyalty.”
The Sydney Telegraph of February 1
came out with-wild, tall headings: “A Lost
Cause! The Protectionist Wail ! Higher Duties
Urged ! A Meeting That Failed ! ” There was
a terrible feeling that the bottom had fallen out
of things in general, and that perdition had
frozen over, and the Devil was suffering
from frostbite in the tail, and Beelzebub had been
eaten by his own flies. And then the reader
came upon this :
The first motion expressed alarm at the increased im-
portations of boots and shoes, and implored the Federal
Government to have the tariff reconsidered, with a view
of checking the introduction of any more footwear from
abroad. . . .
When the motion went to the vote about two-thirds of
the meeting held up their hands in favor. The chairman,
who evidently couldn’t see very well, or was not an
efficient judge of numbers, declared, amid much laughter,
that the motion had been carried. . . .
Why the chairman shouldn’t have declared the
motion carried, when two-thirds of those present
voted for it, no one is likely to know except by
earnest inquiry at the subterranean Sydney den
where the Liberal and Reform League hangs out.
Yet the shoddy importing paper seems to see a
joke in it somewhere. „
The Chow New Year happened last week ;
and Mordialloc, which smiles by Port Phillip, suf-
fered an invasion of yellow silence and large black
umbrellas. It came down on the little seaside place
in a caravan of drags decorated with red and yellow
dragon flags and the usual white girl-teacher whose
mission in life is to be a sister to the placid, slum-
dwelling Chow. The grateful yellow pupils took
the white girl-teachers out rowing on the blue
Australian sea, and the color scheme would have
been complete if there had been a few Red Indians
in the party. During the afternoon a lot of the
gamboge picnickers gathered in a shed on a hill
to soak in some European culture and religion;
but before the proceedings started, a packet of
crackers were exploded to scare off the Devil
and his relatives.. Then a clergyman started,
amidst acrid blue smoke, to fire off amiable but
futile remarksabout there being “no bridgelessgulf
between East and West,” and that social inter-
course was possible between all. About the only
interesting thing he said was that Gordon and
Wolseley had paid tributes to the efficiency of
the Chinese soldier. The Chows sat round cheer-
ing internally, and, after all the talk had run out,
let off some more crackers to drive off the Devil
again. Then they indulged in dead silent sports,
and perspired without enthusiasm until the ap-
proach of evening, when the yellow and white
boating parties came back off the blue sea in
which an apoplectic sun was doggedly drojvning
itself. It was a great and terrible day, and it
concluded about 11 o’clock in Lilly Buck-stleet by
an avalanche of silent, brolly-laden Chow sliding
from a funereal line of drags.
THE UNHEROIC HERO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Speaking to a press representative at the Palace
Theatre, Hugh Ward said : “ I met Baker for the first lime
last night. He came to my dressing-room, and was in-
troduced by his brother, ‘Snowy’ Baker. The first thing
that impressed me was Baker’s wonderful modesty. I
assure you it is quite a remarkable feature of his charac-
ter. I felt it difficult indeed to realise for the moment
that the man who stood before me so modestly and unas-
sumingly had risked his life not once but a hundred times,
and would no doubt repeat such conduct to-day.”—
Sydney Sun.
The hero entered, unobtrusive, grave;
His clothes were as the clothes of other men ;
His hatband did not shout the words, “ I’m brave!
Observe me ! I have risked my life some ten
Or twenty times my fellow men to save.”
He flung no haughty glance from left to right,
No proud, repellent, Jove-suggestiveglare,
As some romantic actor-person might.
Far from it. By the look of him you’d swear
He’d not so much as heard of Julius Knight.
Anon he spoke. And lo ! his voice was soft—
At any rate, he ranted not nor roared.
And in the minds of those who, time and oft,
Had viewed stage heroes, wonder fairly soared,
And people gasped and flung their hands aloft.
It was not strange that Hughie Ward should show
Blank stupefaction at such waste of “ lime.”
Why risk one’s life, then shun the calcium glow?
That is a point which baffles your true mime—
One of the things the pro. can never know.

< The Waratah inquiry is finished at last,
«uad the balance of evidence is that it was an
-absolutely safe vessel which disappeared. But
■what shall it profit how safe a vessel may he when
at is at the bottom of the ocean ? As the legendary
■U.S. Judge put it in his summing up : “This is
the case of a scrupulously honest man who stole a
horse.”
If a man lies awake on a windy night and
wonders if that really is a burglar fumbling with
the window of the spare room, he will be dead-
sure it is a housebreaker before ho can decide
where he left the matches ; likewise, if a man at
the seaside stares into the murk long enough and
with sufficient intensity, he will be able to con-
struct an 800-ton ship in distress out of a birth-
day party’s rockets and colored lights. A hurried
telephone messige late last Thursday night set
the Morse lamp at the South Head signal-station
winking at the pilot steamer Captain, Cook,
which swings at a buoy in Watson s B'ty
and acts as a sort of marine hall-porter to byci-
ney. The long-suffering Cook, on receipt of the
message, slipped quickly out the Heads and nosed
along the gloomy coast for the supposed 800-ton
vessel in trouble. It didn’t find the craft. Safe
and snug ashore a birthday party, its fireworks
used up, sat indoors and listened to gramophone
selections. On a dark, windy eminence a cold-
nosed alarmist stared and wondered ; and out on
the tumbling sea a very mad pilot steamer searched
patiently for a tragedy, and found nothing but
ice-cold spray and the wild, wet nionsoonal wind
that has been blowing rain down Sydney’s neck
for the last six weeks.
There is a sizeable moral about the disaster
that overtook Allen Jones, at Bendigo, the other
day. Jones, who “travels,” was sleeping the
sleep of the “commercial” whose book is full of
orders, when, he says, the Jjord appeared to him
in a vision, and, saying it was Resurrection Morn,
desired him to go on the balcony and try his now
wings. He stepped out accordingly ; but, unfor-
tunately, the law of gravitation hadn t been sus-
pended, so Jones reached the street with a broken
wrist and other damages. When he recovered
consciousness, in the hospital, lie recollected that
there had been a text over his bed—“ Trust in the
Lord ’’—and he is lightening his convalescence by
planning to recover damages from the publican for
supplying him with misleading instructions.
* * * *
The Law can make things horribly un-
pleas mt for Mr. or Mrs. Bung when it really lays
its ears back to the job. The other day a Ballarat
licensee was summoned for allowing a drunken
man to be on her premises; and she had a hard
job to persuade the Law that she couldn t very
well help it, seeing that the man in question was
her husband. If she had put him in the gutter or
the horse-trongh, the Law would certainly have
asked her what she meant by it, and, anyhow, he
was in a private room in her house, and if she
couldn’t put him there she really didn’t know
what she could do with him. The Law refrained
from arguing the point, but told tlie lady to lie
careful in future, and then bowed her out.
* * * *
At Ballarat, the other day, the Law col-
lided with a submerged snag, in its pursuit of one
Diggory Pearce, aged 54, a chimney sweep, on a
charge of bigamy. Last year the rash old flue-
scourer had bestowed his income and affections on
a damsel of 24—who said he was a model husband
—his previous wife, Lavinia, being then alive. The
Law had Lavinia on hand to give evidence, but
was somewhat surprised as well as annoyed when
, that lady asserted that, though she had married
her Diggory in 1897, he was then possessed of a
more previous wife, who was not as dead as he
represented, but whom he thoughtfully divorced
in 1907. Consequently, it appeared to the Law
that the second wife wasn’t really the sweep’s
lawful wedded wife at all ; and, consequently
again, the sweep was legally entitled to dismiss
her from his thoughts when the third lad}' tran-
spired. So the Law took a long breath and pon-
dered awhile whether it should charge Pearce
with a bigamous marriage as regarded the second
wife. Finally, it concluded to drop the matter,
as he was evidently a persistent marrier, who pos-
sibly had other wives before the first, in a manner
of speaking; and there was no knowing where
the thing would end.
HOT ON HIS TRACK.
No. 1: “Is your daughter engaged to young Smith ?”
No. 2: “ Well —not quite, hut very nearly."
One of the Melbourne women—and a
brainy one at that—agitating for a reprieve of
the young man who was sentenced to two years
for shooting his father dead in the cause of
domestic decency, told the Gaud Mayor last week
that “ it comes as naturally to a man to fire a gun
as to a woman to button a glove.” The Gaud
Mayor’s reply was the crushing “Not at his
father, I hope !” When a woman leader of femi-
nine thought declares that a young man fires a
gun at his dad as casually as a woman buttons her
glove with a hairpin, it is time to ask her whether
he would “pot” his mother with equal natural-
ness. And if not, why not ? It seems impossible
for wornen-champions of sex equality to upend
their arguments and look at them that way. The
lady in this case was practically championing the
wife, whose son had sided with her against a more
or less brutal husband. Had the victim been a nag-
ging, violent, exasperating wife, and the shooter
been her impulsive son, the chances are that the
sisterhood would have waited on the Mayor to
draw his attention to the injustice of letting the
shooter escape with a mere two years’ gaol.
THE WINDY DAY.—THE TRIUMPH OF
THE HOBBLE.
At a recent meeting of the boss barbers of
Victoria a dreadful calamity was foreshadowed.
The secretary announced that, “ within a short
space of time, members might look with confi-
dence for an increased price for hairdressing ” ;
Is., he said, would soon be the general rate for a
haircut throughout the Commonwealth, “pro-
bably in March, but at any rate very shortly.”
The mind shrinks from contemplating the pro-
bable consequences ; for, if there is one thing the
harassed citizen can’t boycott it is haircutting—
unless he is' prepared to endure the dreadful sus-
picion of having a poem or a two-line part con-
cealed about him.
The suggestion made recently that George
V. should have a gramophone record made of his
Coronation address, by way of making himself
known in every suburban drawing-room, doesn’t
appear to have interested anyone. Yet, if George
V. could be induced to speak a piece into the
machine to the effect that he has only been mar-
ried once, and that the old story about the
Admiral’s daughter is all wrong, he would
probably make enough out of his royalties to buy
a squadron of Dreadnoughts. Bald platitudes
about the Empiah would hardly be listened- to by
an impatient gramo. audience, with Caruso,
Melba and Harry Lauder all waiting to be heard ;
but a few pointed remarks in a severe, kingly
voice about the Mylius case would grip the circle
every time.

The fact that a Victorian farmer lias been
fined £5 for consigning three black wallaby skins
to a dealer in Melbourne is refreshing ; it evinces
a glimmering of the idea that Australia's native
game is worth preserving. The agricultural
slayer said that he shot the wallabies because
they injured his
crop, hut as lie
had also slain a
native hear,
which cost him
another 305., the
excuse di d n’t
look healthy
enough to pass
the doctor. But
if the law allowed
the inspector
who saw these
things at Spen-
cer-street to fol-
low them to their
destination, and
clinch a £lO fine
on to the dealer
who to’ok de-
livery, the value
of the measure
for .preserving
our fauna would
he considerably
augmented. If
anyone found
selling or hand-
ling protected
skins were liable
to heavy penal-
ties, a lasting boon would be conferred on
many interesting little animals whose only
crime is that they eat a little grass or a few
gum-leaves. A close season which is open at one
end is necessarily a one-sided and generally useless
affair.
“Stony” : This Citizen Army business is
going to kill the Boy Skite foolishness quite dead.
As a Commonwealth area officer lately put it:
“ No, we won’t stop ’em performing. They’ll
just peter out, once we get going. D’ye think
you can see the bold Boy Scout doing double drill
once he’s under the eye of the Government—one
lot of drill which he’s got to do and one frilly sort
which isn’t compulsory ?” And I admitted that I
couldn’t.
A BEREAVEMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We will miss the time-worn stories
Of a certain Fatal Wedding
Which have “ spoofed ” so many Tories
Into casually shedding
Sighs of grief, because the lady
In those narratives fallacious
Had attached a scandal shady
To the person of His Gracious
(England mourns when scandals shady
Dim the splendor of His Gracious).
Tol-de-rol!
There was deep, unconscious humor
In their tone of melancholy,
When they spoke about the rumor
Of the Prince’s “ youthful folly”
Having “ even reached the masses”—
Them who slave beyond the borders
Of the vulgar middle classes,
And are known as “ lower orders ”
(Tories sometimes speak of “ masses ”
When they mean the “lower orders ”),
Tol-de-rol 1
Truth has killed the allegation
Re the admiral’s fair daughter
At the British naval station,
And the Prince who stoop’t to court her.
If she never even met him
When his Highness was at Malta,
Ir. is plain she didn’t let him
Lead her blushing to the altar,
Or the registrar. (The libel
Didn’t specify an altar.)
Tol-de-rol.
W ■, the social Goths and Vandals,
Are profoundly disappointed,
For we love all sorts of scandals
That involve the “Lord’s Anointed,”
And in which the wicked story
Islands just near enough to reason
To alarm the sturdy Tory
With the thought that truth is treason.
(In the gospel of the Tory
Truth is oft akin to treason.)

THE LOVELY LUMPER.
[FOR THE BU LLETIN.]
The wharf laborers engaged in unloading the Marloo
and Arawatta met tins morning to consider the position
in regard to handling cement and superphosphates. It
was decided that .. . the men should come but. Shortly
after 2 o'clock, a company of smartly-dressed clerks
marched down from the A.IJ.S.N. Co.’r office, fortified by
luncheon and a call upon their loyally, and commenced
to unload the general cargo. A hall mark of their order
was the vision of striped and spotted, flowered and parti-
colored socks which their turned-up and tightly-cut
trousers revealed. —Melbourne Hkrald, 28/1/11.
Oh, see the verdant lumper stand
Upon the wharf —a sweet
Young thing, with cargo in each hand,
And rainbows round his feet!
He wears a sunburst-vest. His pale
And lovely cheeks aflame
With loyal fewer—he’s a whale
For lumping 1 Ain't he game 1
How strong he is, and oh, how brave !
A large, blue cop stands by
And watches loyal Cyril slave
With broad grins in his eye.
Backed up by fourteen stone of Law,
Painstaking Percy throws
Mixed cargo here and there to draw
More cash for hotter hose !
Just watch the bright, green lumper hump
His beauteous self around ;
Oh, look ! with Arthur on the jump,
Rainbows at every bound !

The fool Victorian J.P. continues to treat
the wife-beater as a brother. At the Collingwood
Court a week ago a gentleman named Marks was
charged with having assaulted his wife and his
sister-in-law. Mr. Marks had clouted his missus
across the face, kicked her out on to the roadway,
and then dealt out stoush to other members of the
family. The Law stated that one of the women
had been knocked down four times. There were
six prior convictions against Marks ; but the beak
took into consideration the fact that he had only
knocked the woman down four (4) times, and fined
him 20s. On the same day or thereabouts another
case happened at Camperdown. A citizen had a
disagreement with his wife, and proceeded to
correct her with the business end of a tomahawk.
The woman was cut about the head and hands ; so
the Bench decided that the case called for a certain
amount of disapproval—2os. worth, to be precise.
It isn’t added that the magistrates invited the
accused to have a drink at their expense. Per-
haps they didn’t think of it.

“ Adelaide ”: Keeping this land White is
all right; but what about keeping it, when
reasonably possible, Australian too? Most of the
literature coming this way from other States seems
to take it for granted that every laundry and every
market-garden must be kept by a Chow ; and
“Melb.” (B. 5/l/’ll) talks of a “sumptuous Pekin
Cafe, and more sumptuous Canton Cafe,” patron-
ised by whites. It’s aim is—and this is my point
—“ to undercut the Spaniards and Greeks.” Now
why should Greeks and Spaniards bo the typical
feeders of an Australian ? Why
should The Bulletin itself make
every person who opens shellfish in a
yarn say “ Have-a da oyst?” If
things are that way in Sydney and
Melbourne, go to work to patronise
the other fellow. Meanwhile, put
it on record that in Adelaide—(l)
The great body of market-gardeners
—and the supply of fruit and vege-
tables here is possibly the best on
the continent—is good white Aus-
tralian of the second or third genera-
tion ; (2) the Dago has no grip
whatever on the fish, fruit, oyster or
catering trade—there are only two
restaurants at all with foreign
, names, and one of those is run by
) a French cook of many years’
standing, and a good Australian ;
(3) there may be obscure Chinese
laundries, but they are no-class,
and the average citizen would be
puzzled to find one, or to name
a family that employs them. This
city is Australia for the Austra-
lians—in practice, as well as with
its mouth—every time.
In view of the fact that
several more people who are said
to be walking, dodging or trund-
ling around the world for stupen-
dous wagers have lately struck Aus-
tralia, it is pertinent to ask what on
earth they come here for. Aus-
tralia isn’t on anybody’s pedestrian
track round the world, and it is
difficult to see how anybody save
I a fraudulent foot passenger would
take this road. Of course, nobody
can really walk round the globe ;
I but the conditions would presum-
ably he fulfilled if he took the route
on which there was most land and
least water. That is from Eastern
Asia to Western Europe, and then
across America. Australia’s only
qualification to be part of the route
seems to lie in the careless generosity of its
inhabitants and their readiness to hand out food
and beer to very unconvincing strangers.
There is something beautifully strenuous
about the daily paper man when he gets to work
on a really exciting cablegram. For instance,
take this from Sydney E. News (2/2/T1): —
The Plague in China.
Thousands Dying Daily
Bodies Thrown into the Streets.
It reads well; yet consider it, and the folly of it,
in cold blood ! Who ever threw a body? Who
ever waved a cadaver three times around his head,
and then gave a cheer and cast the human tene-
ment of clay into the middle of the highway or
next week? A body may be lifted, dragged,
hauled, shifted, carted, sledged, wlieelbarrowed,
humped or shoved ; but this airy, cheery idea of
throwing remains—sending them hurtling through
the air, so that they will leap two feet when they
strike the hard surface of the earth or fall on a
stray dog—seems absurd. Why should it be done?
Who gains anything by it ? If there was a com-
petition on—something of the club-swinging
variety—and a pair of eminent Chinese athletes
waved two defunct plague patients apiece for 66
hours, the winner to take the gate money, the
affair would be understandable. It might be
gruesome, and if the deceased were waved by one
leg it might be untidy, but there would be no
mystery about it. In the present case, however,
it seems that the bodies are hove gratis. And it
isn’t a mere question of one remains or an occa-
sional cadaver; the plague is a gigantic business,
and something like half of China may soon be
flying in the air, to land with a thud on the tram
line and block traffic. It may be picturesque,
but it doesn’t seem real.
THE TROUBLES of DIGESTION, pain, flatulence,
acidity, and so on, are happily in most cases simply the
expression of some fleeting disturbance of function. The
best way to restore tone and regularity to the intestinal
tract is by taking a wineglassful of “ Hunyadi Janos ”
natural aperient water the first thing in the morning
every second or third day.*
So many wires are being pulled and so
many logs are being rolled these times that, in
Victoria especially, citizens can’t .‘deep for the
creaking and bumping. The latest brilliant idea
is that some chosen men of the Victorian police
should attend the Coronation, “ to study European
methods of detecting crime.” Of course. Not
that Victoria can’t detect the crime already. Its
trouble is that its discredited O Callaghan can't
catch the criminal.

“Hamer”: Talking of the hardships a
callous Labor Government
is heaping on the inoffensive,
well - meaning Australian
landlord, I was recently
shown some rooms in a well-
populated Sydney house,
the walls of which, after a
few days’ rain, were a mass
of mildew. The rooms smelt
like particularly dank cel-
lars. The landlord had been
shown the wreck, and had
said vaguely that he would
consider the question of
having something done. He
hasn’t done anything, and the betting
is a million to one he never will. In
Germany a tenant with anything of the
sort to complain of would simply send
along for a municipal officer; and if
things were not put right within a few
days that officer would send workmen to
do what he thought necessary. The
expenses plus a fine would be charge-
able against the landlord, and recover-
able, if unsatisfied, by sale of the
premises. They don’t need to worry about
immigration in Germany.
The summing-up of “Common Law Side ” :
Doubtless King George never married Miss Seymour ;
but, judging from the cabled reports of Mylios's trial, his
legal advisers were unfortunate in the measures they took
to scotch the aged lie. A foreigner, described as “of
uncertain nationality,” was grabbed, and charged with
circulating the slander. He was hurried before a Judge,
who, sitting in camera, fixed his bail at the prohibitive
figure of £20,000. After he had been a few days in gao;
the trial began. One may take it that Mylius could not
have proved his story, anyhow ; hut even if proofs were
available, it would have been hard, not to say im-
possible, for him to hunt them up situated as he was.
The Crown was represented by the Attorney-General (Sir
Rufus Isaacs), the Solicitor-General (Sir John Simon) and
Rowlatt and Muir, K.U.’s., about as powerful a legal team
as the U. K. could furnish. The accused was undefended.
He desired to challenge certain jurors. He was told he
might not. He asked for his letters and papers, which
were taken from him on his arrest. They were denied
him. The only witness who might have helped him, had
the story been true, might not appear.
According to Rufus Isaacs, A.-G., the proceedings were
brought, not in the interests of the monarchy, but “to
protect the King as a man, a husband and a father.” It
is a pity some gase of the sort was not initiated long
ago, when the man, the husband and the father might
constitutionally have gone into court and denied the
libellous tale. As W. T. Stead remarked, the other daj':
“ For years nearly everybody in any general company
has been telling more or less circumstantial stones of
how Prince George was married to an Admiral’s daughter
at Malta at a time when he never expected to be called to
the throne.” Half a dozen British papers were in the
habit of periodically dishing up the story, and could
have been dealt with accordingly. As things are, the
main advantage gained by the Mylius trial is the estab-
lishment of the fact that, henceforth, anyone who pro-
mulgates the unpleasant old back-stairs scandal is a
certain starter for the Gaol Stakes. It is all to the good ;
but it might have been better.
“George Sharkspaw”: The glorious Coro-
nation approaches, and all true and loyal Britons
will rejoice to strengthen the Bonds of Empire !
The Maries, big and little, are uniting; the
pennies chink merrily in the hat. But what of
the Georges? Is this mighty empire to fall—to
be broken and smashed irretrievably like the
bottle of a precipitate inebriate? No, No! \
thousand times NO ! Awake! Arise! Get tip!
Let the Georges, Gargets, Guys (ancient and
modern) and Guidoes send you their spare
cash. (Herewith please find* my cheque for
3pd.) Let us have a self-denial week (when
the weather cools), and, with the cash saved
buy his Majesty a (Sh ! Keep it dark !) a
sceptre stand and crown rack. Hu hasn’t one.
I have it from the upper housemaid at the
palace, through my valet, that “the crowns is
left lying about disgraceful.” Those are her
words. Recently one of the maids of honor left
without giving notice through treading on one of
them in the dark. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could
give him a surprise? When he returns from the
Coronation, flushed and happy, or bored to death
to find all his headgear dusted and nicely arranged
in a brand-new rack, covered with the loyal sig-
natures of all the Georges, Garges, Guys and
Guidoes of the empire !

“Carbide”: Now that an explosion of
acetylene gas has killed a popular M.P., some-
thing may lie done to regulate by law the storage
and use of this violent substance—how violent may
be judged by the fact that the luckless mechanic
alongside Edwards was blown 27ft. Many country
pubs are fitted with acetylene plants, and while,
ordinarily speaking, they are safe enough, a care-
less or squiffy person has the means at his dis-
posal to wreck the whole establishment. It is
illegal to store more than a certain quantity of
kerosene, but there is no limit to the quantity of
the explosive gas that an amateur can let accumu-
late in a receptacle fit to hold half as much.
THE DEFUNCT HEN AS A HAT.
JESSIE: “ She was cruelly disappointed. He
promised her a dead bird, and wriggled out
of it by giving her a wretched tip for the
races.”
“ Timothy Tufthunter ” : Some time ago
The Bulletin felt a bit narked about the row
caused by church bells. It evidently did not con-
sult the Religious Editor, whom I take to bo
Hop. Now, as Hop could have told, the bells
have rather a large contract to perform, which
should not be sacrilegiously interfered with, or
have borak poked at it. Here is what Wynken de
Worde, who was an associate of Caxton in the
early part of the 16th century, says
It is said the evil spirytes, that ben in the reiryon of
thayre, doubt moeke when they here the bells rongen ;
and this is the cause why the belles ben rongen when it
thondreth, and when grete tempeste and outrages of
wether happen, to the end that the feinds and wycked
spirytes shold be abashed and flee, and cease of the mov-
irjge of tempeste.
The Bulletin will, I am sure, see that church
bells are not to be scoffed at, and will apologise in
sackcloth and ashes. The spelling of the quota-
tion, is not mine, but Wynken’s.
JUST CAUSE FOR COMPLAINT.

Another grievance of post-office employees is stated to
be the working of the boy telephonists during night
shifts.— Daily paper.
The mailbags loomed in the gloom like ghosts, or
corpses of font things dead ;
The sorter slept in the dust-strewn dusk, a mail-bag

M hen from the shades of the G.P.O. a riot of sounds
outbroke.

“ ’Oo kicked me neck?” (Whop!) “Do a bend, or yer’ll

“See Ginger funkin’ tlier leaps?” (Thump, thud!)
“ ’Ere, give us a decent back !! ”
Then up from bis pillow of postcards dim rose a sorter

Six years ago the directors decided that, though they had
just previously written off the whole of the reserves, some-
thing more still ought to be done to bring the bank
back to its old sound position. The dividend was
therefore reduced to 2£ per cent.; and it has
only now got back to the 4 per cent, which was
being paid before the management decided to cut
deeper. Somehow the City drifted into the back
waters, and no very vigorous attempts have been made
to pole it out. “ We’ll just lay here, snug and comfort-
able,”, the management seems to have said, “and pull
ourselves together.” Other banks, which nominally were
in a worse state than the City when the boom of the early
'9o’s smashed, cleared the old wreckage out of the way,
scraped off the barnacles (a long process in some cases),
and, getting out on to the hustling highway, pursued
trade vigorously. The City didn’t. It didn’t even
suspend payment. It just went along pretending
not to notice the wreckage and the barnacles. Of course,
investors guffawed, and quoted the £8 shares down to
£3. The bank would really have been much better off if
it had owned up frankly to some loss and written it off.
It is tfie unknown that is feared ; and the loss in this
case was unknown. Therefore, in the past 10 years—
very fat years, on the whole—the bulk of the business has
not increased largely, and only this change has taken
place in the figures :

Advances .. 1,157,974 1,350,318 16’6
Premises .. 135.821 173,008 24’6
Very likely the position has improved much more than
those figures suggest. Ten years ago there were probably
many rotten securities among the £1,157,974. If those
rotten securities had beep gradually got rid of (the loss on
realisation being made good out of undisclosed profits), and
if they had been replaced by sound assets of the same
face value, solid progress would actually have been made,
even though the figures would show no change. What
has been done in the way of changing new lamps for old
can’t, however, be told from the published accounts ;
but certainly, with the high prices and abundant money
of the past few years, the bank ought to have done a
great deal in this way". If it hasn’t, it has missed an-
other rare opportunity.
The visible movement in the past 12 months has
been fairly satisfactory :

The growth of deposits shows that the public is beginning
to put more confidence in the bank. And that is
very proper ; for there is no reason for any nervous-
ness whatever, so far as one can see. If -the non-
liquid assets were worth less than 15s. in the £, the
depositors and other creditors would still be covered ;
and after all these years, with the nose kept to the grind-
stone, there should be nothing like that amount to be
written off.

That Commission Reserved account must first have a
word or two. Supposing you were sensible enough
to make this co. your executor, and assuming that you
were then considerate enough to die, the estate would
have two charges to meet. First, if it were an estate of,
say, £lO,OOO, the co. would be entitled to one corpus com-
mission of 2£ per cent., and then to 2£ per cent, on the
annual income. Now, 2£ per cent, on £lO,OOO is £250
and 2£ per cent, on £5OO (assuming that the estate earns
6 per cent.) is £l2 10s. Different cos. treat that lump of
£250 on the corpus, or capital value, in different ways.
Some put it into an account and don’t say anything about
it, but draw upon it and drop the drawings in with the an-
nual earnings, equalising their declared income in that
way. Others take credit for the whole lot at once. This is
the worst way of all, because some of the cost of adminis-
tration ought to be charged against this corpus commis-
sion. In other words, the co. really hasn’t earned
that commission until the estate is finally out of
hand; indeed, the 2J per cent, annual com-
mission doesn’t always pay expenses. Then, if the
corpus commission has been absorbed, there
is a danger of the trustee co. scamping its work. A third
small section of these cos. drops the unearned or only
parly earned commission into a visible fund, and draws
upon it as the estates proceed towards their end. The
Perpetual of Sydney is among this number. In the past
year a good many rich people who had made this co. their
exeebtor have died ; consequently there has been a large
increase in the amount of reserved commissions. The
growth of the estates in hand is shown next
1895 £2,424,413

1905 .. •• 5,758,223
1909 6,957,912
1910 .. .. • - 8,175,990
All the time trusts are of course being completed, the
estates being- wound up and divided according to instruc-
tions. The growth of the figures therefore shows the
spread of confidence in the trustee co. (which doesn’t die
or disappear) as against the private trustee (who always
dies and sometimes disappears prematurely).
The profit for the past 12 months (including the
net amount added to the commission reserved fund) was
£10,568 ; but £5OO is written off premises. This is an
amazingly fine return on the capital of £25,000 ; even on
capital and reserves combined it amounts to just over 12J
per cent. Certainly the great prosperity of Sydney helps
the co. High capital values mean big corpus commissions,
and high rental values mean big annual commissions (5
per cent, is charged on rents). Hence, though it seems
inevitable that the trend of total profits will continue up-
wards, it is quite likely that recent profits will not be
sustained when the present boom expires. The margin
between profit and dividend is, however, so very wide
that only a great disaster would be sufficient to reduce
the dividend. *

This co. represents the Law and the Profits. There are,
as a rule, more leading barristers on the Equity’s Board
than on that of any other financial concern in Australia.
And the accounts smell of it. The statute says that
assets and liabilities shall be set out according to
schedule; wherefore the balance-sheet runs this way :
Debts owing to depositors on mone3’
deposited at interest .. .. .. Nil
Debts due on mortgage not already
included in this statement .. .. Nil
Amounts due on notes and bills not in-
cluded in any previous item .. Nil
More than half itssime the balance-sheet is busy epito-
mising the things Which the co. neither owes nor owns.
But while the co. says all that the law says it must say,
it doesn’t say a thing which the law says it needn’t say.
It lumps ali its receipts into one item, and doesn’t
separate income from the trustee business and income
from investments. This is unfortunate, because in most
cases, unless one knows the income, one can’t tell
whether the assets are grossly overvalued or not; and
not knowing that, one can’t tell whether the reserves are
real or not. This is especially the case where, as in
this instance, the real estate is set out at cost ;
and the same applies, of course, to mortgages. They may
be boom values ; or they may be bargain values. As a
matter of fact, there is probably little or no over-valua-
tion here. At December, 1898, the co. had no real estate
and only £5988 out on mortgage ; so the co. wasn’t
choked with boom-time froth. At that time —12 years
ago —the co. had £20,610 of liquid assets, mostly Victorian
public securities. It holds now £31,246; and besides
adding that £10,636 of undivided profit, it has paid
£15,962 for premises. Here, however, are all the material
items:—
Dec., ’9B. Dec., ’O5. Dec., TO.
Liabilities .. £149 £72 £33
Real estate .. Nil . 15,962 15,962
Advances .. 9,832 8,298 7,754
■Liquid assets .. 20,610 19,004 31,246
As the result of 12years’ work, after paying the dividend,
the co’s. premises have been bought and paid for, and
about £lO,OOO added to the liquid assets —or, say, £BOOO
after allowing for the reduction of mortgages and other
advances. Beyond that no information of much value
can be dug out of the accounts. How it treats its
corpus commissions, whether it has a reserved corpus
commission account, whether its business is increasing
and what the? estates in hand are worth—these and most
other things are hidden from the vulgar view. The co. is
in 50,000 shares of 50s. paid to 10s. ; so shareholders take
a solid little liability of 40s. a share to bed with them.
And, on the other side, the co.’s clients take that much
extra protection with them to their little cots.

On the whole, this is probably the finest gold mine, in
N. S. Wales, and one of the finest in Australia. There
used to be two Manly cos.; then they amalgamated,
whereupon this co. represented its position as follows
Capital, 20,000 shares, at £2 19s. each,
paid to 255. .. .. .. .. £25,000
Debentures .. ... 20,000
Interminable debentures (Manly Co-op.
Co. Ltd.) ■ " 8,745
Things stood like that down to 1906, when the tefihinable
debentures were paid off and the interminable debentures
were converted into shares, the shares being issued at 100
per cent, premium. The new capital was then £29,335'in
23,468 shares paid to 255., with £4372 of premium capital
in reserve. Next year there was another juggle. The
old co. was nominally wiped out ; each old share was split
up into five new ones of ss. each = £88,005. That is to
say, the stock was watered to the extent of 300 per cent. !
And still it wasn’t enough to absorb the profits ; where-
fore, 18 months later, another £17,601 of water was added.
The present capital is therefore £105,606 —
Capital actually paid .. .. .. £29,335
Ditto paid out of profits 76,271
Total .. .. .. .. £105,606
Even if the £4372 worth of debenture's which were trans-
ferred to reserves! are reckoned as Capital, the 13J per
cent. div. is thus equal to 42 per cent, per annum on the
capital actually put up by the shareholders.
• > "
For years past the co.’s trouble has been, not to
make profit, but to hide it. For the past half-year the
net profits are alleged to have been £6503—“ after pro-
viding for all costs and charges.” The difference between
that £6503 and ,the £18,971 shown in the table is
explained hereunder :
Added to Public Risk Reserve .. .. .. £1,257
Steamers’lnsurance Fund , . .. .. .. 1,280
Reserve Fund .. .. .. . » .. .. 10,000
Workmen’s Compensation Fund .. .. .. 500
Alleged Net Profit 6,503
Total £19,540
Less Reduction of Plant Renewal Fund .. 569
Profit as per table .. .. £18,971
It is possible, no doubt, that some of these amounts may
be called for later on. The three Insurance Funds—
Public Risk, Steamers’ and Workmen’s Compensation—
are accumulated premiums in excessjof current claims ;
but the time may come when the co. will be struck with
a claim far in excess of the then current half-year’s
premiums. Then, of course, these funds will have to be
drawn upon. A disaster, for instance, caused by the
default of any of the cd’s servants might quite easily cost
the co. as much as Sunshine and Richmond have together
cost the Victorian Railways; for one crowded Manly
ferry carries more passengers than two trains. Further,
there is depreciation to consider; but to provide
for that, the co.’s practice has been to write
off large sums from undisclosed profits. Thus 12
months ago steamers were valued at £78,201 ; now,
apart from the newest boat, they stand in the books at
only £71,096. Nothing has, however, been written off
the item during the last six months; but the chances
are that depreciation has been provided for otherwise.
Two and a half years ago the actual cash in excess of
liabilities was £4294. It is now £39,205. Meantime, over
£50,000 has been paid for two new steamers; the Bellu-
bera alone cost at least £26,443. Considerable addi-
tions have also been made to freeholds and leaseholds
and other property. That £35,000 in cash and £50,000
in vessels represents 2J years’ work after paying the fat
dividend already' alluded to—all on a paid capital, in-
cluding premiums, of £33,707. The opening assertion
that the co. has the finest gold mine in N.S.W. seems
justified.
The question is, Will the reef last ? There are
risks. Apart, from the possibility of very heavy claims in
the event of a bad mishap, it seems certain that the
Labor Government will take the view that the profits
show the co. to be charging the public more than a fair
thing ; and, that being so, if the business is not taken
over, facilities will either be given for a competing co.,
or the lease of the necessary jetties will be refused unless
concessions are made to the public. Minister for Works
Griffith is already stirring up the pot, and is saying very
firmly that the public must get a helping.

This is the best addition to reserves that the co. ha*
shown lor 10 years. Certainly it is not the best profit ;
but the dividend has been reduced to a more reasonable
rate, wherefore the lay-by’ is larger. The table shows a
deficit to start with. This is in consequence of
a goodwill; item of £15,000 not being reckoned
Among the assets. This item consists of Parliamentary
rights and concessions. Those rights are worth nothing
for breaking-up purposes. You couldn’t make bricks of
them, or fry' them, or use them for poultices. Passing from
this intangible and dubious asset, it will be noted that
the other arid more substantial assets are shown at cost.
Even after dedupting the goodwill item from the reserves
shown in the accounts, it is therefore doubtful
whether the balance is a genuine reserve. That
is to sa,y, it is probable that some of it is
merely a set-off against actual depreciation. However,
though no depreciation has been written off the works
and other assets, renewals are paid for out of revenue ;
and if those renewals are kept well up to date, the
present value of the plant, etc., is probably very little if
any less than the book value. The co.’s principal trouble
is that it has to meet keen electrical competition, and
that means cut rates. Consequently, in spite of the great
increase of new buildings in Sydney and the modernising
of old buildings, the gross revenue for the last half of 1910
was actually less than for the corresponding half of 1902
the first year after the Engineering business was cut off from
the parent. The figures are—l9o2, £12,519; 1910, £11,852.
Proposals have been made that there should be an amal-
gamation of the two big competing concerns ; but- no pro-
gress has been made with the matter, though a disposition
has been shown by a strong section of the shareholders of
this co. to “ shake things up.” The financial position is
easy. The only liabilities are a few small trade debts
(£1113), while liquid assets on December 31 amounted to
£11,307.

Three issues of shares now figure in the accounts —an
original issue of 50,000, fully' paid to £1 ; a No. 1 new
issue 6f 25,000, now fully paid to JET; a recent issue of
25,000, sent out at a premium of 2s. 6d., and now paid to
2s. 6d. When the last lot of shares were issued it was
thought that probably the div. would come back to the
old-established 10 per cent. ; but not only ,is the extra
2J per cent, “bonus” still forthcoming, but a larger
amount is put. to reserve than in any term
for five years. Still the new issue doesn’t
really impose any extra burden at present. As
mentioned above, the premium is 2s. 6d., all of which
has been paid, and only 2s. 6d. of the capital has
been called ; so the 12£ per cent, on the new capital actu-
ally means only 61 per cent., and even the most highly
respectable of uncles should be easily able to make 61 per
cent, on his capital. It is very hard, though—practically'
impossible, in fact —to tell the real strength of the posi-
tion of a co. of this kind. The capital is £78,114, the
reserves are £32,715, and other people's money in .the
business totals £12,144 ; and three-fourths of all this
is represented by “ Advances on mortgages, pledges
and other securities, and other assets.” But if all
Israel were. gathered and asked to make man
his own valuation of the miscellaneous lot, the chances
are that no two valuations would agree. On the other
hand, it is quite possible that nine-tenths Of all the tribes
would admit that the co. could get more than the book
Value of the pledges if it had to realise ; and that is really'
the important point. Besides the miscellaneous lot men-
tioned, the co. owns the freehold in Castlereagh-street
(£19,834) and (on Dec. 31) held £9964 in cash.

In comparing the past half-year’s profit with that of the
corresponding fraction of 1909, it should be noted that
more capital has been in the business throughout the
past six months, wherefore the 10 per cent. div. calls for
an extra £5OO. Still, provided that depreciation has been
allowed for on the same basis in each case, an improve-
ment is undoubtedly shown by this very successful co.
The allowance for depreciation is an entirely unknown
quantity. The published Profit and Loss account is only
the shadow of a skeleton ; there is but one item on either
side. “ Gross profit on manufacturing: and trading after
making: provision for depreciation of leasehold premises,
plant, fittings, machinery, etc.,” is the heap into which all
receipts are thrbwn ; and the investor has to depend
wholly on the management with regard to the allow-
ance for depreciation. Obviously, by steadily increas-
ing the deduction, profits could be shown to be steadily
declining; or a bright pink tint could be given
to the co.’s history and outlook by the simple plan of
cutting down the unspecified deduction. And, fora while,
not a soul would know except the 11 insiders.” Moreover’,
it has to he remembered thai, whatever the deduc-
tion, it is a matter of estimate only ; and two equally
honest men may be hundreds apart. This applies more
or less to all trading cos., but particularly to one in Sar-
gents’ line of business. The co.’s other weak point is
with regard to paper a-sets. Of the present capital of
£90,000 just half is represented by nothing more tangible
than goodwill. A certain (or uncertain) number of
people were in the habit of dropping in to Sargents'for
their bun ; and that habit is reckoned an asset worth
£45,000 to this co. It moreover actually represents
£45,000 of the capital ; and if the public for
any reason dropped the habir, that much capital
wouldn’t be represented by anything at all. No doubt
while the habit lasts it is worth a lot of money ;
but it is so unreliable that it ought to be replaced out of
profits with something more solid as rapidly as possible.
Other assets include freeholds (£19,100), leaseholds
(£15,400), and plant and stock. Liabilities were £12,941);
on the other side on Dec. 31 there was cash £7214.
The financial position is, therefore, satisfactory
enough. The business has been extended rapidly,
and a whole drove of new premises opened. This
has obviously been done at little expense to capital—
which is satisfactory from one point of view, but carries a
sting in its tail; for it means that the new premises are
leaseholds, and every leasehold involves a contingent lia-
bility, spread over some period or other. Moreover, when
the term of the lease expires, the landlord has a habit of
chipping in and demanding practically a share of the
profit, if a profitable business has been established in his
premises. So, though the co. hasn’t increased its vbible
.debts through opening so many new branches, it has only
avoided doing so by increasing (1) its contingent lia-
bilities and (2) its risk of having to share some of its
profits by-and-bye with its landlords.

£lO,OOO in excess of the value at which'it stood in the
books. Pending completion of payments, the co. carried
the £lO,OOO to a “ suspense account for dividend reserve
fund.” Recently, though the final payments had been
made by the council, this account was still £5lOO in credit.
The directors now pay Is. 6d. per share out of the fund
by way of a bonus; which explains the last two lines in
the table. This sort of thing won’t be a shock to these
shareholders as it would be to those of a good many
Queensland cos. There are very few Queensland con-
cerns, in fact, that have had so few ups and downs
downs especially. Even in the days when Brisbane was
suffering a recovery, and when the headache was at its
worst, Brisbane Gas paid 9 per cent, ; and when
things started to get a Dit better it was able
to transfer £20,000 of reserves to capital, issuing one
new free share for every seven old ones. In
spite of the payment of a very solid div. on this watertd
capital, the co. has gone on not only paying for exten-
sions of plant and mains, but also accumulating cash and
other liquid assets. This shows what has been done m
the latter respect
Dec., 1902. Dec., 1910.
Liquid assets .. ..£33,851 .. £44,853
Liabilities .. .. 3,685 .. 5,298
Surplus .. .. £30,166 .. £39.555
Meantime, as mentioned just now, plant and mains have
been extended —largely extended. In other words, the
consumers, besides paying for all renewals and additions
made during these eight years and providing a handsome
dividend, have put £9389 into the co.’s store of liquid
assets, besides adding a few trifles to the stock of resi-
duals, etc. It is impossible to say how much has been
added to the plant, land and buildings ; the book value
has been increased by £38,132, but that isn’t necessarily
all that has been spent by any means. It looks, in fact,
as though a good deal more had actually been spent, see-
ing that the sales of gas, etc., have increased from
£22,056 in the last half of 1902 to £32,194 in the past six
months. On the admission of its own figures the co. is
on a wonderfully good wicket; and in these days when a
jealous eye is cast upon gas cos.’ profits, the directors are
not likely to give the lily more paint than is absolutely
necessary.

The condensed remarks of C. S. Cross, Sydney :
The Secretary of the Maoriland Rheumo Co., Ltd., stafc s
(B. 2/2/’11) that the prospectus of the Australian co.,
issued in Sydney, is a tissue of misstatements ; but h
only proves oneitem, and then simply to his own satisfac-
tion. The prospectus of the Australian co. says the
Rheumo Co. of M.L. was a co. of £3OOO paid-up, and that
the dividends were about 7J per cent., besides bonuses.
The M.L. sec. agrees as to the capital paid up, but
joins issue in regard to the other figures. A few
shares were issued on payment of 55., he says. This proves
to my mind that the “ few shares” represent (say) 100 ;
not more, or Mr. Menzies would have said a few
hundred.” Therefore £25 was put into the business; and
on that capital a 5 per cent, dividend has been accorded
the lucky holders of the whole 3000 £1 shares fully
paid up—shares which cost them nothing. A 5 per
cent; on 3100 shares means £l5l 55., equal to
605 per cent, on the actual capital invested.
The fact is that a Rheumo Co. of Australia would hurt
the pocket of a M.L. co., because the latter has been
notified that an injunction will be sought to prevent ini
po.rtations of the manufactures. You will note that in
the prospectus issued here (but sent from M.L.) the
statement in regard to profits was said to be based on the
vendor’s knowledge, obtained from last year s balance-
sheet shown to him by one of the shareholders ; never-
theless the promoters said: “But no positive infor-
mation is available, none being procurable from Maori-
land.” The shareholder still informs me that he received
his share of the first capital, besides a £l2 bonus, and
then sold his rights to the original syndicate, now the
company. I cannot apprehend why no information was
accorded a courteous request of November last, while it
is publicly given unasked in February. The question
one naturally asks is : Was there anything to hide ! Oi
were they fearing further investigation?
The sensation of the week has been the arrest of
Harold Greenway, Dyason and Bonwick in connection
with the Chaffinch business. The charge is that they
conspired to depreciate the value of shares by the pro-
mulgation of false statements. All three are well-kno\vn
mining men of the younger school; two, if not the whole
three, are University graduates in mining science.
Apparently the evidence relied upon by the Westrabap
Government, which has taken the proceedings, has been
got mainly from the telegraph office, backed, probably,
by the share transactions of the accused. Thmr.lawyers
all took an early opportunity to say that tlT&jr clients
were not guilty ; they suggested, in fact, that the men

From an old mining man who swears he hasn t
a penn’orth of personal interest in the matter The
only work of any importance done on the Bullfinch ”ro-
prietary mine consists of two shafts. No. 1 was sunk
100 ft. and bottomed on country rock. Driving westward
was then done, and a crosscut east was put in, but failed
to find ore. The only sign of any extension eastward of the
ore exploited by this shaft is the ISin. vein on the side of
the plat. The owners then went 30ft. east of No. 1 shaft,
and there sank 64ft. in very rich ore, and again bottomed
on rock. Seems to me a fair question to ask the owners
why two shafts were sunk within 30ft. of one another,
when a very few feet of driving would have done as weil
as 100 ft. of sinking. Was it for ‘ window dressing’ that
the second shaft was put down? A short distance east
of No. 2 shaft a third shaft was sunk, and some cross-cut-
ting done therefrom ; but no ore was found. I think
it can be safely said that 25ft. or thereabouts east from
No. 2 shaft is the eastern limitof the Bullfinch rich deposit.
West of No. 1 shaft there are indications on surface of
three, and perhaps four, formations swinging in from the
south-east, and turning in such a manner-as to make up
a fairly continuous line of ore ; but it is quite safe to say
that values in these deposits, although perhaps payable,
are not rich. The only other work of importance on the
Proprietary is the Water shaft; and some idea of the
speculations indulged in as to values can he gained by the
information received about it by a visiting engineer. He
u'ked the chief owner, the prospector and the manager
the values, interviewing gentlemen separately, and
received the following figures : 2£oz., 3Joz., loz. He was
able to obtain a sample, and found that it was worth
9dwt. There is no doubt that some very rich ore
was developed in Nos. 1 and 2 shafts, but a large
proportion of the best of it has been extracted
and sent away, although sufficient has been retained to
make a sensation when required. Statements made
regarding ore reserves have also been exaggerated. For
instance, Mr. Jones, the prospector, on October 30
stated in Perth that he estimated reserves at £640,000,
and that the vein had been proved to carry high values
for an additional distance of 280 ft., making in all 400 ft. of
high-grade ore in sight. On the date of this report the
only ore that could be called even probable ore
was that opened up in No. 2 shaft, say 40ft. in length,
together with a further 40ft. or 50ft. driven upon from
the bottom of No. 1 shaft. Finally, the vendor and his
agents, who still run the whole show, have closed the
mine to independent experts, which may be all right, but
looks bad.”

Kuss’s full report smites the disabled Golden
Horseshoe (W.A.) hip and thigh. Among other things,
it states that there are absolutely no grounds for hope
that dividends will be resumed for years, and that tiie
small profit which may be won in the interim (Kuss
reckons it may amount to 4s. per ton of ore treated) must
be usbd principally for development. He recommends the
creation of a special reserve fund of at least £lOO,OOO
before anything is put by for dividends, such fund to
serve the further purpose of allowing the co. to search
for other properties. Seeing that the co. already has a
debenture debt of £lOO,OOO, as well as other big creditors,
it looks as if it will be years before it gets even, and years
after that before it will be in a position to give share-
holders anything. And judging by the appearance of
the bottom workings of its next-door neighbor, the Great
Boulder, there is a danger of the co. never again being
in a position to distribute anything at all.

Accounts of the Kalgurli Co. (W.A.) now show
no bullion in transit. All the gold is sent to the
Perth Mint instead of being shipped away, and the
cash proceeds are remitted to England in due course. The
co. still keeps well ahead in the matter of cash resources,
the amount standing to its credit at the end of the year
being £68,000. Then there was £25,000 or thereabouts
invested in Indian rails.
■* * * *
A growl comes from Kalgoorlie about the way
in which South Kalgurli is alleged to be worked. Some
good makes of ore are stated to have been lately un-
earthed in various parts of the mine ; but somehow these
finds have not been made public. Maybe the management
has something to say on the point.

Geologist Dr. Maclaren on the Great Fingall
position : “To September, 1910, the Fingall lode produced
more than a million ounces fine gold. The true course of
the lode fissure is north and south, but when it meets the
unsheared mass of the ‘ Fingall ’ dyke it takes the line
of least resistance—that is, the shortest line across i.t—
resuming its original course on the other side of the dyke.
It is, moreover, only where it crosses the ‘ Fingall ’ dyke,
a distance of 1200 ft., that the fissure is auriferous, thus
displaying a remarkable relation between the nature
of the enclosing rock and auriferous The
breadth of the dyke, in short, constitutes the maximum
possible length of the shoot. Since the dyke dips north-
west, the shoot naturally pitchesinadirection compounded
of the dip of the fissure and the dip of the dyke—that is,
due west. The fissure carries quartz of two ages—(a) an
older dark blue to blackish quartz, and (6) a younger white
quartz deposited during re-opening of the fissure. The
former alone is auriferous ; the latter is barren, and,
according to the conditions prevailing at the time of its
deposition, may lie on the hanging wall or on the footwall
of the old lode, ormay occupy, as between the No. 14 and
the No. 16 levels, the whole width of the fissure. Where
the old lode was much crushed, it is either laminated
with younger quartz or is impregnated and cemented by
it, giving a characteristic mottled appearance.
“In view of the surplus crushing plant of the
Great Fingall Company, considerable attention was paid
. to the possibility of now abandoned lodes being reopened
to furnish ore ; but there is, on the present showing,
nothing worthy of attention outside the Great Fin-
gall leases. Within them future exploration can be
recommended only for the deeper levels of the
‘Fingall* lode, within the ‘Fingall’ dyke, and
for a narrow shoot on the ‘Golden Crown ’ lode. Exami-
nation of the ‘Fingall’ ore body indicates that the con-
ditions now obtaining at No. 17 level duplicate those on
No. 1 level. There is, therefore, considerable ground for
hope that the ore body below No. 1 level will also be re-
peated below No. 17 level. The geological conditions
favor this view. There is no change in the character or
dip of the country, the fissure is as strong as ever, and
the proportion of the older black auriferous quartz is
now increasing with depth. The only lode known en-
tirely analogous to the ‘Fingall’lode is the ‘Champion
Reef ’ in India, where, after passing through poor zones,
the lode is as strong and rich at 4000 ft. as it was near the
surface.”

The little party of half a dozen or so who own
the Fenian, at Meekatharra (W.A.), continue to thank
their lucky stars that they didn’tsell the mine for £30,000
a few years ago. In those days Meekatharra was unproved
at depth ; and the northern fields of Westralia had been
mostly cold disappointments when prodded. Last year the
Fenian’s monthly divs. were continued —never under £2OOO
and sometimes £3OOO. Plant has also been added to.
Hitherto the average grade has been about loz. Bdwt. ;
but with the plant duplicated the grrade will be reduced
to a shade over loz., and the monthly profit should work
out at about £4500. The mine is developed down to
600 ft., and approximately four years’ supplj' at the in-
creased rate of production has been proved. Recently an
option was given over the property with a view to flota-
tion in London. The purchase price fixed is £250,000,
£200,000 payable in cash and the balance in shares at the
option of either party. If the option is exercised the
first payment will be made next month.
* * * *
Queen of the Hills, Meekatharra, has been
taken over by 8.,M. and Co. for £6OOO. The working:
option was eight months long; and at 250 ft. the lode has
been cut, but not proved for width. Leslie Williams,
who got a pat on the back at Oroya Exploration Co.’s
general meeting the other day for his work in connection
with the Youanme options, engineered the Queen of the
Hills deal.
* * * *
The news has leaked out that the Gt. Boulder
lode is worth next to nothing in the bore at 2800 ft.
Coming on top of the blank drawn by the co. at 2650 ft.,
this disappointing development is bound to send an icy
shiver down the backs of some shareholders.
***■*■
Associated Northern (W. A.) has been officially
given another year’s lease of life, but the mine will pro-
bably last a little longer than that. Between now and the
time fixed for its demise, profits amounting to between
£15,0u0 and £20,000 are expected to be earned ; hut this
includes revenue derived from public crushing. The co.
is still on the lookout for a mine or some other delusion
in another part of the world. -
Mines Inspector Crabbe (W. A.) has just given
the Minister his views on the newly-discovered Mt. Jack-
son field. Crabbe says that granite is the predominating
rock in the district, and reckons that the present shallow
workings on the more or less rich schist veins should not
be regarded as important or as giving reliable results, and
that the future can only be determined when the sulphide
zone is reached. He also mentions the existence of
immense outcropping lodes which he considers well worth
prospecting.
* * # *
Announced that CHilde Harold (W.A.) is to be
re-opened after six years’ idleness; also that its old
crushings averaged 9dwt. They didn’t do anything of the
kind, and the Mines Department records will prove it.
Anyone who puts money into this venture had better pre-
pare for the worst.
* * * *
Paringa (W.A.) lately came out with a report
for 15 months ended October last. This states, among
other things, that the revenue earned more than defrayed
the cost of management and supervision, and that the
value of the co.’s property has been considerably en-
hanced by a new discovery. The Bulletin', however, is
unable to persuade itself that this newly-found patch of
good ore is likely to he permanent. This co. now has
mining interests in West Africa.
* * * *
The Northern, at Lawlers (W.A.), has lopped a
bit off the monthly tonnage on account of increased
hardness of ore. 8., M. and Co., who boss the show,
state, however, that the smaller quantity treated will be
more than made up by improvement in grade. The co.’s
Erincipal workings in the Waroonga lease are claimed to
e looking well in depth. Meantime, shareholders are
buoyed up with the rather faint hope that a dividend*
will come along some day.
■* *' » *
Last year the much -improved Broad Arrow
field (W.A.) yielded 15,4870 z. gold, a little of which came
from the dolly-pot and dryblower’s shaker. Both Ora
Banda and'Waverley, which are included in the area, have
shown, up a bit lately; and the Gimlet South, in the
former district, stands a good chance of being mopped up
by Lionel Robinson and party for flotation in Lunnon.
The most attractive show at Waverley is the Siberian
Consols, where 1000 tons of 3oz. stone is said to be stacked
on the surface. The locality, however, is notoriously
patchy, and the gold has an annoying habit of cutting out
very suddenly.
Kyloe (N.S.W.) may repeat its history. For
years it lay idle because the shallow ore bodies were ex-
hausted ; but deeper prospecting revealed another shoot.
Lately it has looked as though this shoqt had been
passed through at No. 5; but lately they have been fol-
lowing a channel from 4ft. to sft. wide, and now ore a
few inches wide is making on the west wall. This is at
150 ft. north from the shaft. You can’t call it a new ore-
bodv yet; but it may be the beginnings of one.
* * * *
Harden (N.S.W.) made a lucky stroke when it
picked up the Harden Central for a song. Its own wes-
tern drive at 450 ft. is now well into the old Central ground ;
and fbr the last 50ft. there has been a payable body
of storie. The face assays £3 Is. for a width of 3ft. The
find has completely changed the outlook.
The Tolwong (N.S.W.) complex-ore proposition
pipes “ Eureka ! ” The furnace is a success, and the first
lot of copper matte has been sold. Row, about costs?
* * * *
Though Kangiara (N.S.W.) must have a very
bitter tiste in the mouths of many trustful people, some
more tnbney, it seems, has been got in, and deeper ex-
ploration is to be tried. Of course, the cash could only
be got On pref. terms; and, after the prefs. have had
their cut, the outlook for the other shareholders is
almost black enough to paint a fireplace with.

Cobar Copper, Ltd. (late Young Australian and
Mt. Pleasant) couldn’t work its property owing to short-
age of funds ; so a tribute was let in the Young Australian
portion of the property. The tributors were not long in
getting 60 tons of dirt going 8£ per cent, copper and
2dwt. gold ; and more of the same quality is being raised.
But it isn’t big—only four or five men working.
•*r * * *
At Wyalong (N.S.W.) recent developments at
the Junction and Amalgamated leases are very satisfac-
tory, compared with the big slump in the value of ore
that took place some time ago. On other properties
very little of importance is being done, though Neeld’s
are still prospecting for the lost shoot at the 900 ft. level.

Most news about the English-owned Mount
Boppy, near Oobar (N.S.W.), has to drip down from the
Fogland. During November the mine crushed 6752 tons
stone for 12150 z. gold ; but the total production for the
month was 36070 z. Mount Boppy thus obtains two-
thirds of its gold from by-products ; and it had to handle
13,868 tons of stone, tailings, slimes, residues and con-
centrates to rescue ils 36070 z. The mine is developing
well at the northern end of the 600 ft. level, and it is
intended to sink Henry’s shaft another lift and spend
£lO,OOO on machinery. This co. is extending its opera-
tions to the Hargraves goldfield, where it has a promising
mine—the old Blue Spec—under development.

The Mines Inspector has vetoed the use of a
benzine engine in the shaft of the Cosmopolitan
(N.S.W.); and in consequence the mill is only running
half-time on low-grade ore raked up from the top
workings.

Electric cranes, drilling machines, rollers, and
other rail-making machinery are being screwed together
at Lithgow (N.S.W.); and this department will soon be
turning out 601 b. rails. The steel has to be up to the
department’s severe test; but the Hoskins people have
no fears on that point. They are drawing their iron-
stone supply for this metal from Careoar and a quarry
near the Mudgee railway extension.

Unless something 1 extraordinary happens within
the next few months Broken Hill is going to be badly
tied up for labor to work the mines. At the present time
what are now the leading mines of Broken Hill —the
South, North and Central—are experiencing serious diffi-
culties in doing things on the desired scale. The under-
ground men were never furiously overjoyed with the
terms of the new wages agreement, because they knew
from experience that, when the surface men pocketed a rise
of ss. 3d. per week, there would be less chance of the
contract men making big pays. In other words, the}'
accused the companies of entertaining the project of cut-
ting the price of contracts as fine as possible in order to
save in one department what the new wages scale was
costing them in another. So contract parties began to
pull out wholesale, and the companies found it difficult to
obtain men to fill the vacant working places. New im-
portations were tried, but the hands proved so green
that they were more trouble'than they were worth. At
one mine a party of imported truckers were set to work
at the bottom stoping level. They had to urge the loaded
trucks of ore from the shoots to the plat, from which
they would be hauled to the surface. But, unfortunately
for them, they took the wrong track, and passing the
plat, ran their trucks to th» dead end of a long- drive and
left them there. The mistake was discovered when the
platman began to yell for ore.

The cat is out of the Waihi (M.L. ) bag at last, and
shareholders are in future to receive quarterly dividends
of 2s.—just half of recent payments. The descent, how-
ever, is to be eased off by a last distribution of 4s. in
March, and one of 3s. in June, thanks to the large carry-
over of profits. Hope is also held out of a small bonus. It
is a serious setback, and all the more likely to be acutely
felt because many people bought in at about £lO a year
ago in the belief that they would get £1 per share per
annum shortly, with a prospect of more. Since then
shares have fallen to 755., a shrinkage of over three mil-
lions in the market value of the stock, and these folk have
seen their 10 per cent, investment dwindle to about 4.
It is another illustration of the folly of reckoning any
metal mine as an investment. Probably the Waihi has
attracted a bigger proportion of widows’ mites than any
other in Australasia. There are people in the Dominion
who had got into the habit of putting all their spare cash
into the scrip. In illustration whereof writer heard re-
cently from a man who bought a fair-sized parcel,
100 or so, and whose purchase was made up of little
holdings, the largest of them being nine shares.
The circular, which, in view of continued reassuring
statements, falls like a bombshell on those not in the
know, makes some amends by its straightforwardness.
The greater part of it consists of a very frank report by
R. E. Williams, the Co.’s engineer, who has eight years’
experience of the property. Williams admits that the
outlook at No. 9 level is gloomy. There the crosscut
from No. 4 shaft to No. 6 shaft has run into soft country
rock similar to that at the surface. “ A bad indication
the world over,” he remarks. In other words, it looks as
if the big Martha lode, which has hitherto supplied half
the tonnage for the mills, has been lost. The big stoping
blocks of ore 80ft. wide have dwindled (o 15ft. and 20ft.
Ore reserves are estimated at 1,003,000 tons in sight,
while about 600,000 tons remain in arches in the upper
levels. This gives about five years’ supply ; but the chief
reason for reducing the tonnage is that the arches
cannot be removed quickly enough. Hence, Williams con-
cludes that the output must be reduced to 1000 tons
per day by next December. As to prospects, he believes
that good rhaltes will still be found, but more and more
in lenses or bunches ; the long and continuous shoots
which made the mine such a big bullion-producer are
apparently a thing of the past. The directors have
adopted Williams’s recommendation and cut down the
dividend to fit, while an extra-vigorous development
policy, with No. 12 level (1450 ft.) as its object, is to be
undertaken,

The Charley Coal Mines Proprietary, Ltd., held
its first meeting in Sydney the other day'. The Charley
C. M. Prop, is, no doubt, mostly Philip Charley—he is
“controlling director,” and no other director is men-
tioned; but Dr. JaCk, formerly Government Geologist of
Queensland, is consulting geologist and secretary. The
properties are at Tryphinia, 70 or 80 miles from Rock-
hampton ; and the area secured runs to 16,000
acres. The coal lies in a basin, and has been
prodded by numerous drills; and the idea now
is to sink an incline shaft to Cut three seams,
and then crosscut about 2000 ft. to ascertain more
precisely the thickness and quality of the coal
contents of the basin. As far as they have gone, the
people who are making this bid to open up a new coal-
field declare that their coal is “ smokeless, and ranges
from'7s per cent, to 86 per cent, fixed carbon, and is
therefore of a higher calorific value than any other Aus-
tralasian coal ”; and they have their eye on the naval
stokeholds.
Philip Charley deserves a cheer. As a youngster
he fell into the Broken Hill Prop. He was among the
originals ; and his interests were closely looked after by
George McCulloch, of Mt. Gipps station, for whom he
was working. Many a youngster, with half a million or so
ahead of him, would have followed McCulloch to London,
and buzzed among the fleshpots there. Instead, Charley'
set himself up (nr down) as a horse and cattle breeder
at Richmond (N.S.W.) ; and, besides doing good work
for Australia that way, and incidentally taking an in-
terest in Defence matters, he has always been ready to drop
a few thousands into mining ventures. Not the dead-
sure things either ; but things that called for more pluck
than the man with the average purse can afford to show.
And he doesn’t sit down in town and pour out the coin ;
he puts his own brains into the development work,
whether it takes him to Tasmania or to Papua. As for
the men and machinery to help him, if they can be got
in Australia, no other place is in the running ; and if
they can’t be got in Australia, he mostly wants to know
why, and is prepared with another few pounds to supply
the deficiency.

Many Peaks pyritic deposit, in Central Queens-
land, though regarded by many' as a mere flux quarry',
stands out as one of the most important of recent Aus-
tralian mine discoveries. Of course, it isn’t nearly so big
a proposition as its foster mother, Mt. Morgan ; for the
value of the Peaks’ reserves, reckoned at 840,000 tons,
doesn’t run to a round million, while Mt. Morgan, 140
miles away, can sometimes produce that much in a single
year. They are, however, only down to the 470 ft. level
at the Peaks, though numerous bores indicate that the
deposit lives at least 300 ft. deeper, with values averaging
1£ per cent, copper. Except that the metal contents are
about the same, there is no close parallel between Many
Peaks and Mount Lyell, because at the latter mine the fur-
nace charge contains practically' twice as much pyritic
ore as silicious. At Mount Morgan these conditions are
reversed, for less than one-third of the total charge of
ore fed to the furnace is pyritic ; and even that pro-
portion’appears to supply a superabundance of sulphur.
Sulphur facilitates the production of matte, but if the
matte is of low' grade for copper it requires re-treatment
to bring it up to 30 per cent, converter grade.

• Cumberland P.C., near Charters Towers, re-
cently put through a crushing obtained in deepening the
shaft for an average of £5 7s. per ton. They are now
driving No. 3 level to the west, and after traversing a bar
the reef has opened out to ISin. of heavily mineralised
stone. These workings are comparatively shallow, being
only 230 ft. vertical; but the shaft, following the dip of
the formation, covers from 300 ft. to 400 ft. These develop-
ments on the Cumberland reef are worth watching.
Cumberland Golden Ant, about 100 ft. from the P.C., is
sinking a shaft, and at a depth of 63ft. the reef has
widened to 18in. of good-looking stone. ■

The King George syndicate is prospecting some
old tin shows about 60 miles north-west from Charters
Towers. There is a battery on Stockyard Creek, 14 miles
away, and carting of tin ore is done at a reasonable 15s.
per ton. Daintree’s mine, named after the geologist and
surveyor who discovered the Einasleigh, was found and
worked between 40 and 50 years ago. It has been stoped
along the surface for 200 ft. The workings are all shallow,
and a fairly strong shoot of ore is left underfoot in places ;
so there is a good chance for the prospecting: syndicate.
It is reckoned that £lO,OOO worth of tin was ob-
tained down to an average depth of 40ft. ; but
that includes the product of a group of old mines.
This paper never has much confidence in the yarns it
hears about highly-payable gold being left showing in an
abandoned mine. But with tin it is different; for the
metal has frequently sunk to a third of its present price,
wherefore the highly-profitable ore of to-day might have
been highly unprofitable when the last pick-stroke was
put in.

Durham Consols, on the Etheridge (Q.), has
struck a few inches of fairly' good stone at 750 ft. vertical.
The Etheridge is an old field, but it has never been
worked to that depth before. It will take solid evidence
of permanency to give Dill-hams a hold on the market.
The field hopes for the best, however, and has shouted for
itself once or twice to go oil with.

Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in trans-
mission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings
save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent, of oil, so one of
the first duties is naturally for engineers to direct their
special attention to these bearings and to car boxes for
trucks. Hyatts are in continuous use in Cement Works,
Ore Dressing Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bush-
ings of flexible rollers may he applied to loose pulleys or
truck wheels, etc. Should engineers require further
details, they can apply to the Australian Agents, YV. &
J. Lempriere, Melbourne ; or E. W. Hursthouse & Co.,

The most modern, simple and effective Vacuum
Slimes table is the “ Wilfle.v.” It is continuous, and con-
sists of a revolving drum which is partly submerged in a
tank of slimes or material to be filtered. The drum is
covered with a filter cloth supported on grooves on the
drum, which are connected by means of holes to the
interior to allow the liquid to be withdrawn. Through
the trunnions at the ends of the drum the vacuum pipe
passes to the interior. This pipe connects with the
interior of the drum, through which the liquid and air
are withdrawn by- means of a vacuum pump. The filtered
slime is removed by- a simple apparatus placed at or
below the level of the pulp in the tank. So that directly
the cake is removed the surface of the filter cloth as it
revolves is immediately- re-immersed in the pulp ready to
receive a fresh cake, thereby preventing the sucking in
of air, and consequent loss of vacuum between the time
the cake is removed and a fresh one is forming. The
residual liquid in the slime cake is removed by distribu-
ting water over the surface of the semi-dried cake. Owing
to the fact that the filter is circular in form, it will be
seen that it is continuous in operation, and has no com-
plication of valves to get out of order ; furthermore,
work is being done continuously during the whole revolu-
tion of the filter drum. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company-, of South Melbourne, have the sole manufactu-
ring rights of this filter.* [2

“ Calafane ” : “Gilgunnia” asked the
Religious Editor to give an opinion whether the
gidyea tree repels ants. Well, lam neither reli-
gious nor an Editor (Hallelooyer !), but as I have
been laying gidyea low for the greater part of the
last three years, I feel qualified to speak on the
question before the House. Gidyea does not
repel ants, as “Minaritchee ” would soon find out
if he were to hang an uncorked waterbag on the
timber in question. The evil smell is there all
right, though, especially in muggy weather or
before rain; and the odor is a cause of severe
headache to those obliged to work adjacent
to the scrub. Gidyea runs a good second to
the der-rink in that respect. I should say
that the stench emanates from the leaves,
as the wood itself has a pleasant aroma, similar to
that of yarran, myall and boree. The itch which
takes its name from the gidyea, may come from
the coating of the leaves, or more probably from
the snuff-like contents of the hairy caterpillar’s
silken home on the ljreezy heights of Gidyeaville.
Finally, the cutting of gidyea, per medium of
Douglas, is heart-and-axe-breaking work, and
creates a surprising demand for beer.

“J.W.R.”: “Yigilans” is partly wrong
about the frilled lizard (B. 5/1/T1). He is not
confined to the far North. A smaller variety of
him lives on the Paterson River, near West
Maitland (N.S.W.). Met one on the bank of the
river some months ago. He was perched on the
top of a stump, and was gazing intently Heaven-
ward, wrapped in Sabbath thoughts. When I
disturbed him he looked at me with a cold eye and
took to the water, using the breast stroke.
Wanting to know what he would do next I
heaved a stick at him, and immediately, with a
contemptuous look at the troublesome biped, he
dived. I waited several minutes to see him come
to the surface, but he didn’t. About 30yds. up-
stream a willow soaked its leaves in the water.
When I passed under it, I heard a rustle among
the leaves, and there was the Elizabethan lizard
perched on a limb. I know it was the same
Lizzie, because of the truculent angle at which
the frill was worn.

“The Scapegoat”: “Pick” proves him-
self (B. 5/1/Tlj to be a person of little discrimina-
tion when he upholds a feathered vulgarian and
nuisance like the soldier-bird against my gentle-
manly thrush. The thrush has a certain'dignity
and old-world courtesy ; his rival is merely familiar
and coarse. The remarks of the former are de-
livered in a clear, bell-like tone; the soldier-
bird’s insistent, raucous squawk is calculated to
grate on all but the most uncultivated ear. I
admit that “Pick’s” friend hunts other birds
from fruit, but it is only to gorge on it himself.
He is always a meddlesome busybody, as any
sportsman who has had game startled by his loud,
tactless chat will agree. In fact, and finally, he
is impossible. I will go further and propound
the theory that he is a Cow.
“Jack”: Be “ Rastus ” (B. 29/12/TO)
and the Maori (or Polynesian) word “ pa.” Cor-
rect. Re the terminals ending in vowels, correct
again. Every second letter in Maori is a vowel
unless preceded by “wh ” or “ng ” ; then it is
the third. Re the word which, he says, means “I
don’t know.” He’s also right there. He doesn’t
know. The two words are “ aua hoki.” “Ana”
is all that is necessary. It is not a contraction.
The “hoki” isemphasis,
just as whites say “ex-
actly,” or “ exactly so.”
It not only means “ I
don’t know,” but it is
also intended to convey
“I don’t cure.” Prac-
tically, “my trubs. 1” I
have earned part of my
daily bread and beer
through a knowledge of
the language, and I
guess I know. Re " Ko-
whai” (B. 5/1/T1), He’s
right in most of his
assertions, but when he
says “the only reason
the half-caste doesn’t
appear so frequently as
of yore is because the
Maori girls know more
than they used to,” he
lies. Maoris live truer
to Nature than whites,
but they are dying off
all the same. Do “Ko-
whai,” “Bros.” and co.
know of any good trait
in the Maori character ?
Here are some. Un-
bounded generosity.
You are welcome to
a share of Henare’s din-
ner, be it Christmas
cake or dried shark, at
any time. Second, an
intense love forchildren.
A Maori woman is con-
tent to nurse anybody’s
child, and it is cared
for just as faithfully as
if it were being tended
by its own mother.
Also, in their own way,
they are clean too. A
Maori won’t cook his
spuds and eels in a
vessel that has been used
for washing, clothes.
He considers this the
acme of filthiness. Many
white bushmen and boardinghouse-keepers don’t.
The trouble is that men live in certain districts
for a while, or Fosterfraser this land o’ quakes,
and form parochial or superficial ideas from their
few contacts.

“ Jerry B.” stakes his honor on it :
“Gip” makes a request for a prescription to keep ants
and other beasts from mooching about the precincts on
the weatherboard cottage of the busy bee. We used to
keep bees when I was out West, and had the same ex-
perience as “Gip” is having. Tried everything, from
painkiller to an electric belt; but all failed until one day
Dad arrived from town with a new recipe—adead-suie
thing, viz., chloride of lime. If “Gip” cares for a little
gamble. I’ll bet her my 53 last year’s Bulletins to her next
week’s issue of scones that not even Footballer Messenger
of antdom will dare to cross a line of the said disinfectant.
Just run aline of the chloride along the ground around the
hive, and in the event of failure, I will undertake to walk
backwards to “Gip’s” residence, even unto the valley of
Jehoshaphat, and hang, draw and quarter every ant
within a 10-mile radius.
“ Gecko ” : The surest way to dispose of
a carpet snake is to give him several severe swipes
across the liver with a divining rod. It’s useless
to bang him on the brainless skull. In three-
score and ten years in the Australian hush, I have
repeatedly handled and thoroughly examined all
species of snakes ; and as sure as snakes multiplv,
the carpet is brainless. Thrice have I jabbed the
iron-shod heel of a bluoher, with a I4st. pressure,
on the head of the species, crushing it to a pulp,
and then left it doing a George H. Wriggle with
its cranium as flat as a long-drawn beer. On the
following day I have returned to see what pro-
gress the ants had made with their skeletonising
operations; and, to my astonishment, every time
I have found the carpet-pattern python with a
natural, normal noddle playfully poking out its
tongue as if nothing unusual had transpired.

“J. 5.8.”: “Stan’s” remarks(B.22/12/TO)
on the Queensland Matilda are an insult to the
lady. It is impossible to roll an elegant horse-
collar swag with less than six straps. There
must be a strap at each end. and if “Stan ” can
roll about 7ft. of the lady, bend her round and
make a good figure of her without corsets, he
possesses a secret worth a fortune. Without four
morestraps he will find she bulges in the middle
in a most unfashionable manner. Also the swag;
he describes is not rolled in the “shape of a,
log”; two sides are flattened a little so that it.
won’t roll about on the back of the wearer. When
I first met Matilda, in 188(5, she was a calico-
covered female, cut out for hard work ; but I sus-
pect the creature “Stan” mentions is of the
hobble-skirted, cartwheel-hatted variety. In fact,
I believe I met “ Stan ” once on the Paroo carry-
ing a swag consisting of an empty oil drum, round
which he had rolled his blankets. He also wore
corks round his hat; and when I dropped on him
he was sitting on Matilda and fishing in a gil-gi
hole for Murray cod.

“Uncle Jim”: After many years’ resi-
dence in M.L., lean endorse “Kowhai’s” opinion
(B. 5/1/T1) that Jack Maori has the tired habit
abnormally developed. Remember some 40 years
ago, at the Bluff, where the contractor for clear-
ing away the sand for the railway station yard
had a gang of navvies filling trucks. Each day a
number of male Maoris sat for hours watching the
men until one day, when some trouble arose, tools
were downed and the work stopped. The Maoris
offered to take the place of the strikers, and
were immediately put on. Away they started,
and in a few minutes the surrounding atmosphere
was thickly peppered with sand. In less than 10
minutes, however, they began to flag, and in about
five minutes more, with one accord, they shook
hands with the job and went over to the pub to
drink its health. With regard to “Kowhai’s”
other assertion, that he did not think much of the
boasted chastity of the Maori women, I do not
think he is doing them justice, I have met many
nigger tribes in my wanderings, and I confidently
assert that the Maori women are far more chaste
than any others I have ever met, and, as a race,
could give points in this respect to the women of
so-called civilised countries.

A DEAD HOUSE VISION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A arhost of twenty years ago arose ;
I heard the jingle of a bridle-rein ;
I said within my heart: “ Now I suppose
Ned Kelly’s come to haunt my dreams again,
“ Or Morgan, or some riotous dead man,
Who held up half the country with a gun,
Rises from places subterranean
To walk the earth like a pale spectral dun.”
I heard him hitch his horse up to the post
While in my bunk I made pretence to snore,
Resolved I would not open to the ghost
However hard he hammered at the door.
But he came in. Dim light was round his head,
A colored muffler swathed his bony throat,
Fixed with a horseshoe. He was plainly dead
Although he wore a heavy overcoat.
Gathering the blankets underneath my chin,
I sat bolt upright. “ Who and what are you ? ”
His laughter was exceeding cracked and thin,
“ I have some verses here,” he said, “ a few
“ Bright jingles, racy of Australian soil—
Things that the papers here might like to print.
We corses sometimes burn the midnight oil,
Or rather phosphorescence. Have a squint
“At these.” He handed me a bulky pile
Of eloselv-written manuscript that felt
Clammy with grave-damp. His appealing smile
Might well have made the jaded reader melt.
I scanned the paper. “ How We Beat the Dook,”
“ The Maiden Plate,” “ The Man that Rode the
Deuce
Hoary horse-rhymes that this lost soul mistook
For marketable song. “ I said “No use,”
And sadly shook my head. “ Not good enough ? ”
He queried as his wide smile went to rout.
“ Oh, good enough.” I ahswered, “ but this stuff
Is only fit for corses—quite played out
“ Within the living world. You still may write
Of love and wine, and many other things,
But the horse-song is dead. Its withering blight
Descends no more. The poet now on wings
“ Of nobler flight ascends the Austral sky,
Singing of engines, warships, Wowsers, cows,
Japs, oysters and the light in Mary’s eye,
And anything but horse. E’en pig-tailed Chows
“ Are sweeter than the stable.” “Woe is me 1 ”
The corse replied, and, through' a panel crack
In the closed door, he faded solemnly
After the fashion of “The Third Floor Back.”
Yet, still in circles round and round we go
And Mary’s dresses, kept for twenty years,
Will almost certainly come in, you know,
To deck in newest style some modern dears.
Though last year’s fashions and last season’s verse
Are each, by some, regarded as a corse,
Who knows? Some lofty bard may yet rehearse
Anew the wonders of Australian Horse.

“ Les Another Australian name goes up
on the world’s list of champions —“Professor
Fred Fox, of Botany (Sydney), snake expert. I
saw him for the first time at La Perouse last
week giving an exhibition before a crowd tha*
stood at a respectful distance while he poured
snakes over himself from half a dozen sugar-hags.
There were brown snakes, tiger, black and carpet;
nearly all loaded to the teeth. Fox has abso-
lutely no fear of these descendants of the original
destroyer of the home, and is happiest
when he has tormented them to a stage
of fury. Dozens of times he has been bitten,
but be swears by his antidote, and so far
the bite has seldom killed him. Some day, of
course, he’ll leave the bottle at home, or the cork
will come out and the liquid won’t he available on
sudden demand, or it’ll become a member of the
amalgamated Serpents’ Union of Poisoners and
go on strike without giving the notice required by
the Act of Emergency, and then there’ll be a
vacant professorship and the lunatic risk-takers
of this country will be another madman short.
But there is no doubt that Fox has a remarkable
influence over the beast that walks on its chest,
and the most vicious of the species, after the first
hostile expression of opinion, will sit on his
shoulder and whisper abject apologies into his
ear.
“ Bad Egg ” : I observe with sorrow that
the papers are chronicling the records of infants
who have attended school with consummate
regularity for an awful period. The latest
is Celia Goldsworthy, of Northeote (Vic.), who
never missed a day for 12 solid, stodgy years. I
want to assure Celia that she has missed a lot;
so much, in fact, that she hardly knows she
is horn yet. I spent a period at school my*
self, and I won a few prizes, certificates,
etc.; yet my choicest and most enduring
recollection is of the day I first “wagged
it.” We were five or six, and we went
fishing, till the monotony of catching
nothing palled. (Probably the fish were
also confirmed scholars.) Then we in-
vestigated a field of turnips and sampled
several. The farmer presently chased
ns with a whip and a dog ; but we
“fused ” with the dog, and the farmer,
being a bulky person, merely added to
the day’s joy. After that we took stock
of certain orchards, and I nearly broke
my neck in descending hastily from a
mulberry tree whose owner was making
rather good time towards us’; and,
finally, we topped off with a satis-
factory feed of half-ripe blackberries.
I fancy I indulged in these to a slight
excess; but, of course, I dared not
say anything. Several times I felt
sure I was about to die, and, towards
morning, as the blackberries came to
the boil, so to speak, I fervently wished
I would, and be done with it. Never-
theless, I managed to attend to a
liearty breakfast and felt so gener-
ally satisfied that I wagged it again a
week or two later. But the memory
of that first time always stays with
me—and that is one of the delights
Celia will miss. It is not too late for
her to reform; but she can never do it
cheerful irresponsibility of childhood,
fore, I say “ Poor Celia ! ”

THE VERNACULAR.
COUSIN JACK MINE CAP’EN : “Billy, boy, go'st
long hoame and tell thy faither that I do
want ’e fer t' come in fer to tranimy last
coore by night." (Which, being interpreted.
means: “ William, go home and tell your
father to go on night shift to-night. He is
to go trucking.”)
“Spade”: N.S.W, Works Minister
Griffith, having restored Barren Jack to its native
Burrinjuck, might next turn his lamps on Barren-
joey, the ridiculously-named peninsula which
carries the Broken Bay lighthouse. Itsaboriginal
name is Baranjue, for which the modern name is
grotesque substitute.
“ Berkeley”: Re “ Jamble ” (B. 12/l/’ll).
The carpet-snake is a maligned native. He may
look menacing, but he is perfectly harmless.
Whenever a grief-stricken agriculturist or other
bucolic tells me of the death of 1-o-v-ely cows,
b-e-a-utiful dogs, s-p-l-endid turnips, and so forth,
at the fangs of the carpet snake, I know that the
trouble has been occasioned by the deadly broad-
headed snake. Its markings are somewhat simi-
lar to those of the carpet snake, but, as far as I
know, it never reaches a greater length than sft.

“ Bash ” : An old forest-nurseryman, who
has his profession at his boot-toes, so to speak,
assures me that if young eucalypti of any variety
are “ planted out,” hares and rabbits will attack
them with readiness and a sharp tooth, whereas
if they shoot from seed sown directly in the soil,
the young trees are immune. If this is so, back it
up, somebody, and let me know incidentally why
bunny should regard the transplanted seedling as
a lawful tooth-sharpener, and the directlv-grown
plant as an object of fear or respect —or both.

“Gil Gunnia ” : “ Wealsman’s ” use of
the bike lamp as an aid in spearing Tasmanian
flounder (B. 26/l/’ll) reminds me that the Binghis
on the Fitzroy, Nor’-West Australia, still use fire
and spear for capturing their fish supply. They
light a torch, which they hold overhead, and their
keen eyesight can detect fish at a depth of four or
five feet. They use a single iron-headed spear
with a wooden handle. The flaring, unsteady
light bewilders the fish, but it also makes the
retraction more difficult to gauge, and the new-
chnm can do no good at the job at all. But the
native fishermen become amazingly expert. I
have seen a party of five spear over 50sand-perch,
parrot-fish and mullet in a couple of hours on a
cloudy night.

“Marloo”: Re “ Nunawading’s ” query
(B. 12/1/T1) re tea-tree or ti-tree. It all depends.
Which tree does he mean? Presumably the
gentleman which grows by swamps and flats and
wears a light-colored tattered overcoat. Then
the name is spelt “ tea-tree.” Its classical name
is Melaleuca, and it grows only in Australia and
Maoriland. As Webster states, “It is often erro-
neously spelt ti-tree or ti-tri.” Still, there are
several species of ti-tree (Corduline lerminalis,
G. australis, etc.) found in Asia, Australia and
the Pacific Islands. It grows to a height of 10 or
12 feet, and has leaves of a reddish hue, which
the natives use for thatching. The roots have
food properties, though I prefer roast lamb my-
self.
PERSEVERING BILL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Viola did not resist when he drew her towards him and
kissed the fragrant coils of wavy golden hair. — Conclu-
sion of a lovely love-story.
The gums above them softly sighed, a sigh of perfect
bliss,
And Bill sat in the dark and tried his best to score a
kiss ;
He kissed her, yes, he kissed her, there with vigor and
in haste,
Fair on her lovely golden hair, his arm about her waist:
A tangled, golden-hairy kiss . . .
In language plain and blunt;
A foozled kiss! Itavas small bliss
For Bill to kiss his lovely miss
Fair on her golden front—
Fair on her fragrant, peroxided front.
Her fluffy head-fur did abound in various scented oils ;
’Twas padded, piled and wreathed around her beauteous
brow in coils ;
And William tried again, and snatched another one,
although
She said : “ Oh, Bill and then he took to breath-
ing, soft, and low,
All sorts of words which were not right. . . .
He felt a hitter pang
Because her lips were out of sight ;
He’d kissed her [blow it!] in the night,
Once more upon her hang—
Squandered more kisses on her golden hang!
The gums above ’em sighed ; up-creek all sorts of night-
birds cried,
And Jane sat tight and did not speak, with William at
her side ;
And William muttered grimly, just as he had done
before,
Thinking upon his foozles. “Bust it!” he remarked,
once more,
Then holding his bush-princess fast
In Cupid’s patent grips.
Triumphantly he won at last,
Ere half that moonless night had passed,
Her pretty cherry lips !
He dodged her fringe at last and found her lips.

Jabez : There is some force in your plea that
as this country is part of the British Empire, we ought
to admit Britain’s alii’, the Jap. Provided the terms are
equal The Bulletin sees no objection. Britain’s alliance
with Japan expires in 1915, and if every Jap in Australia
will also expire in 1915—why, let them come. But we
want to be sure about that expiry... .J.M. A.: Choicest
sample of rubbish we’ve had this year. The last man
this present writer talked to on Thursday Island,
instead of wasting to a sallow shadow, had put

Australit: Both fail. Please get some ink. Our weary
eyes object to pencil... .O.S. : When we read the first
verse of the spasmodic love-poem, we remarked : “ This
is a trick poem. It is all about a mosquito.” The fol-
lowing verses confirmed our suspicions—we could see
you waving the insect off. When at last we arrived at
the last verse and found that you really had been writing
about a girl all the time, we felt we had been misled.
Now look at the first verse and see if it doesn’t suggest a
mosquito :
“ Get out! Get you gone ! ”
Says the voice, but the will
Won’t assent ; and anon
She’s disturbing me still.
And consider these:
So that when night falls and
Sleep should give some relief
Prom a realm of dreamland
That is troubled and brief
I awake and resume
Daily toil quite oppressed
While she, I presume,
Quite ignores my unrest.
....Maxim (Cape Town): S’African politics are oft our

“ Rooinek ” (B. 24/11/’10) said the Boer reps, were mostly
ahead of the others, he didn’t know what he was talking
about E.O’L.: No doubt the best pressmen do get to
the big cities sooner or later. But of the people in this
shop, one started to get his training at Rockhampton,
and another at Bendigo, and another at Bathurst, and a

A day’s hard work—the sun went down.
We met at Murphy’s hut;
There some gambled, others drank,

They staggered, and Bill sent
A blow across his head.
He fell a pale, pale corpse,
An awful moment—he lay there dead.
Disgrace nojv to the home must go,
And 1 the news take back ;
Do you wonder why I love the home
And not Outback?
I cannot hate the day I went,
For we went out to win ;
Success and shame and Bill’s good name
Were sacrificed for cun.

E.F.L.: Second instalment of “The Chalice” to hand.
On examination, we find that it consists of 44 faintly-
pencilled verses and the warning “ Unfinished.” Suggest
that you re-christen it “The Burrinjuck Dam.”
Besmot: Regret unsuitable Abel F. : Sawmill verses

of planing down... .A.C.E.: Afraid he won’t sing' to you

it M.R.E.: There are some really impressive words in
it, and you juggle with them deftly ; nevertheless, the
yarn is quite hopeless....Up-to-the-Minute : No, thanks.
Billo : Certainly. If the population of England and
Wales increases for two more centuries at the same rate
as between 1801 and 1901, that little country will contain
about 128,000,000 people in the year 2001 and 512,000,000
in 2101. It is a simple matter of arithmetic

Discons’late ! Can I get nothing past you—
You vile, vitriolic varlet? Blast you !
The second verse of the curse is feeble. To merely curse
as an unvaceinated knave a vile, vitriolic varlet who had
been effectively blasted is whitewashing the lily—or
words to that effect.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
Roba : The first and the last are the best. The others
may be original XXX: One' may do Admirer:
That yokel joke is a very' old friend. For years he wan-
dered into the office and asked for the usual-ss. Nowa-
days he merely asks for the silver as a matter of form,
and then curls himself up snugly in the wickerwork.. ..
Spero : Jokes too involved. A quip which demands five
verbose sentences to explain itself is fatally over-dressed.
“ Pick ” : If Aboskifces have done assailing
me because of my assertion that rabbits belonged
to the cold-water party and could not live with-
out moisture, I would remind them that, contrary
to their apparent fixed conclusions, I never did
insist that it wanted rivers or acres of liquid for
the requirements of rabbit, sheep, goat or’roo. My
contention is that the moisture provided by occa-
sional rain, dew and green herbage is sufficient
for those animals ; and in regard to bunny I have
taken the trouble to prove that, if kept without
water, and fed on dry stuff only, he will throw
the seven in less than that number of sunsets.

CHINESE NEW YEAR,
Since Sunday evening the neighbor-
hood of Little Bourke-street has been
strewn with fragments of fireworks.
Street-cleaners endeavor to clear the
thoroughfares, but the debris inevitably
reappears. The Chinese New Year is
responsible for this. The noise of ex-
ploding crackers tells that the Chinese
are attempting to frighten stray devils
from their residences.

Z132: “ Lucky for you, old chap, we haven't got
wireless! ”
Ex-Railway Commissioner Felion, of N. S.
Wales, died last week, aged; 77. He had done a
bit of railway work in England and Canada before
coming to Australia, but was with the McCulloch
Carrying Co. when the Government made him the
colleague of Eddy and Oliver. He had made a
fair pot of money out of McCulloch’s, but dropped
on to Corona Station, in the Ear West, just before
rabbits and overstocking helped the drought to
finish off most of the squatters of those parts ; so
he had to give squatting best, and keep his nose
to the Railway grindstone. He only retired on
Johnson’s arrival, three years ago.;
T. F. Quinlan, Speaker and Father of the
Legislative Assembly of Westralia, is retiring
from public life.
Mr. and Mrs. J. Davis, of Buladelah
(N.S.W.) —he is the local schoolmaster—have 16
children, and not one of them has yet left home.
If it isn’t a record, it is surely close up.
Last week there was a certain amount of
wailing in Lillie Buck, for the Rev. Moy Ling
was dead. Ling, who was 79, had for many years
been chief of a Melbourne Mission for Chinese.
He came to Australia as a very young man, and
for the greater' part of his life industriously angled
for souls. He also fathered a family, one member
of which is the Collingwood clerk of courts.
Norman Lindsay recently went about
London sketching various venerable institutions,
inter alia, the Tower of London. Before he had
done more than a hundred pounds’ worth a police-
man seized the sketches and confiscated them.
Lindsay wrote expostulatory letters to the “ haw-
thorities,” who replied on superfine paper that
they did not know of anything which would pre-
vent the artist from sketching the Tower. Lindsay
retorted by asking if they had never heard of the
London police, and hinted that anybody who
wanted anything larger than a London policeman
to prevent him doing something was a glutton.
“ Tarboy ” on the shearing champion-
ship :
It seems as if it is to be settled at last; for Charley
Maurer, of N. S. Wales, has challenged Fred Zimmerle,
whom Southern Queenslanders have long considered to
be the best shearer in the world. The pair have signed
articles to shear for £5OO, and a side wager of £lOO and
the championship, at Toowoomba. The match will pro-
bably take place on February 15 at the Austral Hall.
Whoever wins will find a crop of challenges on his hands,
for there are at least, a dozen who are in the championship
class, and a dozen times as many who are near it. What
a match it would he if such giants as Harry Livingstone,
Fred Zimmerle, Charley Maurer, Larry Dryden, Frank
Horsburgh and Charley Fleming,to quote a few, could only'
he brought together! There are also such men as Danny
Cooper, who sprang into prominence last season by up-
setting the long-standing tally of the late Jimmy Power,
put up at Barenya (Q.) nearly 20 years ago. The tally
stood at 315 ail that time, and is now 316 for one day’s
shearing with the machine. Of course no one man can claim
the championship, for the event has never been shorn
for; but now that the matches have been started, the
question will be settled within the next year or two.
“Historicus ” : Derwent Wood, the most
brilliant sculptor in England to-day, has just
done a bust of Tom Roberts, the Australian
artist. When the last London mails left he was
putting the finishing touches on a statue of Wolfe.
It is not generally known that Captain Cook was
with Wolfe at the Battle of Quebec (Plains of
Abraham). Cook and Wolfe are the two men
who gave the British Empire its only two really
valuable possessions—Australia and Canada. Yet
neither is represented by any memorial in the
entire length and breadth of England. The only
two white persons in the whole Empire who
have so far been commemorated, sculpturally
speaking, in England are W. B. Dailey, of
N.S.W., and Macdonald, of Canada. Wolfe will
make the third. His statue is to stand in Wes-
terham, the Kentish village where he was born.
Derwent Wood’s career has a personal interest for
Australians; he married Florence Schmidt, our
singer.
McClelland, recently appointed Victorian
Railways Commissioner, was a clerk in the ruck
of the service when old Jock Mathieson took
a fancy to him and placed him in the sec-
retary’s office as assistant to R. G. Kent, who
was little more than a figurehead. Jock was a
hitter devotee of the Yellow Pup, and poured
his heart into the ear of McClelland, whom
he regarded as anti-Irish too. One day they
were touring together, and at dinner the old
man noticed that McClelland was abstaining
from meat. It was a Friday, and a horrible
suspicion assailed him. Leaning across the
table, hedemanded, in afierce whisper : “Why
don’t ye have a decent meal, mon? Ye’re
not a demned Catholic?” McClelland ad-
mitted the offence, and Mathieson never
forgave him. Heaven only knows what might
have happened to Mac. if the old chap’s
thoughts hadn’t been soon distracted by the
offer of a fat job in the Cold Country. I
“Char”: Met the ex-Australian,
Arthur Lynch, M.P., recently, in London.
He has had an eventful career since he left
Melbourne, in 1888. His wife,a bright and
charming little Irish lady whom he met in
Paris, when he was acting as correspondent
for one of the London dailies, fought a
ard battle for his release when he was im-
prisoned for treason over the Boer business.
She interviewed Home Secretaries and other
influential people, and at last went, on advice,
to Sir Thomas Lipton, who was on friendly
terms with the late King. That did it.
Afterwards Lipton told her: “I just said
to his Majesty, ‘ It’s this way, you see.
The laddie was just carried away the same
as we might have bceen oursel’s.’ And the
King laughed, and that did it.” Lynch, by
the way, is related to some of the very pursiest
of Victorian Fatmen—the very pillars of
smug Toryism.
The most interesting feature of the libel suit
which ex-Sergeant-Major Edmondson brought,
and lost, last week against L. S. Amery, editor of
“ The Times History of the Boer War,” was Tim
Healy’s appearance in court for the plaintiff.
Healy, who is now out of politics for good, only
took silk at the English Bar a few weeks ago,
and the Edmondson case Was the first in which
he was briefed outside Ireland. In Dublin,
Healy was Carson’s rival, and eight times out of
ten liis master. The big English leaders are
getting out of the business to a large extent; thus,
in the last couple of months, Eldon Bankes and
Lush have gone on the Bench. Rufus Isaacs has
become Attorney-General, and Sir John Simon
Solicitor-General. Healy, who is a brilliant law-
yer and an amazing advocate, should move to the
top in record time.
Lawyer and Councillor J. F. Hamilton, of
Brighton (Vic.), is dead. He was a partner in the
Melbourne firm of Hamilton, Wynne and Riddell,
and later was the senior man in the business of
Hamilton and Wilkes. Awhile back he had
thoughts about politics, and fought Orangeman
Snowball for the late Bent’s seat. Unfortunately
he was defeated, although intellectually and
politically he was the better man. The con-
stituency that preferred Bentofold to the brilliant
George Higinbotham never did want the better
man.
QUOTH THE RAVEN, “ NEVERMORE”
Mr. Holman said never again would he go to an inter-
state Labor Conference while things were on their pre-
sent basis. “The events of the last few days have
opened my eyes. I feel strongly upon a certain point,
and unless I can see the inter-State Conference reformed.
I am afraid I shall have to step outside a movement to
which I have devoted my whole life.” —Daily Paper.
Though Justice Cohen is 70 years old and
entitled to a pension, he expects to return to the
N.S.W. Bench when he has finished his six
months’ holiday. The Supreme Court pensioners
now include M. H. Stephen, G. B. Simpson and
Wm. Owen, who draw £lB2O each.
Alexandra will not, it is reported, attend
the Coronation of George and Mrs. George, there
being no precedent for the presence of a Queen
Mother on such an occasion. Probably what is
really meant is that there is no precedent for the
presence of a Queen Mother who feels even half
as angry as the Danish lady does.
Edward Green Snowden, brother to Mel-
bourne’s legal ex-Mayor Arthur, lias gone along
to the Taxing Master, aged 83. He and brother
Arthur were in partnership for many years ; he
kept his nose close to the tape and wax, while
Arthur did the social hobnobbing more or less
necessary to bring business in a profession which
can’t advertise its virtues in the press or send out
circulars announcing that it will hold a Great
20 Days’ Bargain Sale of Opinions. E. G. Snow-
den’s specialty was real estate and conveyancing ;
and he worked it to some purpose as Examiner of
Titles for a fair slice of liis long and generally
uneventful life.
G. B. Edwards, the M.H.R. whom an
acetylene gas explosion killed last week, was
wandering along the dusty Inky Way of Hobart
when father-in-law Peacock, one of the early
Tasmanian jam-makers, invited him to quit it;
and he quitted promptly. First, he looked after
the boiling fruit in Melbourne ; then he passed on
to Sydney, and was still piling up wealth there
when a year ago the Henry Jones Co-opera-
tive Co. was formed, and the Peacock business
was absorbed with various others. While he was
potting stewed-gooseberries and such-like, Ed-
wards kept up his bookish habits, and was one of
the best-read men in the Reps. Also, he held
many views that gave great pain to the red-tiled
roofs of Wade’s neighborhood. Thus 1 a visit to
Europe made him throw the old “ voluntary
training” fetich overboard; and he was a most
persistent advocate of the principle of Elective
Ministries. Also, The Bulletin remembers that,
when a memorial to Charles Kingston was pro-
posed, G. B. Edwards was the first member of the
Reps, to send along his cheque.
B. Jove : In view of the many defects
that have shown up in the Victorian railways
since Tait left, I think George V. might consider
the advisability of making him something less
than a knight. Personally I am of the opinion
that justice would be done by reducing him from
a knight to a Judkins Pleasant Sunday Afternoon.
A little exodus of pressmen from Mel-
bourne to London is in progress. Besides James
McLeod and John Reay Watson, who have just
gone, two others are packing. J. V. Macdonald,
of the Melbourne Argos, leaves one of “the
prizes of Australian journalism ” next month, and
another Argus man is throwing away a similar
“ prize.”
The leader of Boy Skites in America is a
Braidwood (N.S.W.)native, Dr. P. J. H. Farrell,
who went abroad for adventures in the ’Bo’s
studied medicine in Chicago, fought Injuns and
such like ; was in Cuba ; went as Surgeon-General
with the American army which conquered the
Philippines; was in China with the American
Pekin contingent; and, in short, has been in every
land scrap that the Americans have been in lately.
There are lots of Farrells dotted over Australia—
alrnosta.il typically fine Australians, who attend
to the birth rate religiously.
General Piet A. Cronje, the man who
made Jamieson look and feel so foolish at the
time of the “Raid,” is dead. Both then and
during the war the illustrated papers pictured
Cronje as the usual large, heavy, truculent-looking
Boer, armed with a bludgeon. As a matter of
fact, Cronje was an undersized man of delicate
appearance and a wonderfully active brain.
Sir John Fuller’s appointment as suc-
cessor to Sir T. Gibson-Carmichael, of Victoria, is
another instance of the slump in the office of
State Governor. According to “Who’s Who”
the new man has been an A.D.C. and, subse-
quently, a vice-chamberlain at Court. Also he
has been defeated three times as a Parliamentary
candidate. On the other hand, “ his family is
well known in Wiltshire ” ; “ he possesses a fine
property in Wiltshire”; “in 1900 he wrested
the Westbury (Wilts) seat from Captain 01ml-
loner” ; and “in 1898 he became allied with one
of the oldest families in Wiltshire.” Plausible
reasons, doubtless, why he should be the Emperor
of Wiltshire; but they don’t give him any par-
ticular claim on the Governorship of Victoria.
Lady Meux, once among the richest of
British widows, died a month or so ago in Eng-
land. She captivated beer-
maker Meux through appear-
ing in a Surrey pantomime;
and after that there was no
more occasion to twist her
heel and shake her toe.
Meux left her £50,000 a
year besides Temple Bar,
which he bought and had
removed piecemeal from
London Strand and
erected on the Meux
estate, Theobald’s Park,
near Enfield, Herts.
She was horsey, like
Connie Gilchrist, and
had the luck to win a
Derby. But the monster
brewery was her chief
concern ; her rule over it
was absolute up to 1902,
when the public took one
of its fancies that the
“swipe” was not so
good as it used to be,
whereupon Lord Tweed-
mouth was allowed to
choose a minority of
the directorate. Still
the public went on
shaking its fickle head,
and the consequence
was that for some years
before her death Lady
Meux —ent steadily on
the dwindle. She gave
£20,000 for an artillery
battery in the Boer
Blunder, and, altogether,
was no close-fist.

G. A. McKAY, the
Commonwealth Land-
tax Commissioner.
Frere, the biff mount of the Bellenden Ker range, I
came on a relic of Linlithgow, who, as Hopetoun,
made a brief but gorgeous display as thb Common-
wealth’s first Governor-General. ; It was a deserted
coffee plantation, which, in itis infant days, gave
promise of providing' much of the brown berry
for Australia’s use.. When Hopetoun first struck
these shores with his wonderful chariots and other trim-
mings—he was then Governor of Victoria—there came
the Messrs. ,f)e Moleyns—formerly Mullins —brothers of
that icy dajiie, the Countess. About that time the scrub
lands of North Queensland were being discovered in a
productive sense, and the De Moleyns took up a big
selection, and, with the financial backing of Hopetoun,
felled many acres of thick scrub, made roads, and planted
thousands of coffee trees, as well as sugar and bananas.
They topped off the panorama of industry with a beauti-
ful homestead perched on a natural plateau, command-
ing a view of glorious scrub and silver creek, backed by
the mountain, down which a glistening ribbon of water
cascades for a sheer 900 feet—a place of exquisite beauty.
They also built a big coffee mill, and harnessed the water
from the fall. All of which cost a mint of Hopetoun’s
money. The local historian has it that the De Moleyns
did not get enough back to pay their mine bill, or
satisfy' a nice taste in pdte de foie gras ; and much to the
sorrow of certain suppliers in Cairns, who had found
them excellent customers, they closed up. Now Ichabod
is writted over all. Hopetoun paid a few visits to the
place, arid no doubt the manly view he expressed when
he said—“ The North seems to me to be a very desirable
place for a white man to work in ” was framed from per-
sonal observation whilst on one of these junkettings.
TALE OF A MOTOE-OAB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London, Tuesday Evening.—An action was brought in
the High Court to-dav by’ Mr. Daniel O'Connor to recover
damages from Mr. Kilby’, a merchant, for injuries received
by’ being knocked down by a motor-car.
Counsel for the plaintiff said he was a member of the
Legislative Council of New South Wales, which was
equivalent to being a memb-r of the House of Lords.
Mr. O’Connor gave evidence that he left Australia at
the wish of the Government to encourage emigrants and
generally boom Australia. Prior to the accident he was
a s rong man ; now he was a wreck.
The action was settled, on terms which were not dis-
closed.—Cable.
Dan ! Old Dan, of the matchless brogue,
The shiny hat ar.d the snow.v fleece—
Like to that which was once the vogue
In the days of Ashur (on whom be peace !).
What is the word that conies from far,
Filling our souls with grief and awe ?
Dan knocked down by a motor-car !
The Jaynial Wan in a Court of Laio !
Say, O ye gods, what age or clime
Such an imposing sight affords !
Does England hold such a soul sublime?
Where’s his like in the House of Lords 5
What are marquises, dukes and earls,
Or all they ever have said, or done,
To our oratorical Pearl of Pearls—
Dan O’Connor, the Jaynial Wan?
Picture him in the witness hqx !
Eloquent, sonorous, suave, precise ;
Tossing unparalleled hoary locks
Like Abraham at the sacrifice !
“ Ah, me Lard, wud ye cast an oi,
A calm, compasshunate oi me way?
Shure Oi’m a wreck, and loike to doi
An’ nivermore see Austhra-li-a !
“All Oi recall, as yerLardship knows,
Was the didly shock an’ the sickening thud,
An’ the saponin’ mud on me iligant clo’es,
An’ the crowd an’ the cries an’ the strainin’ blud.
Oi lived, ’tis thrue, as yer Lardship sees ;
Shure ’twas a merricle sint from Hiven !
But Oi’m a wreck that was onct, if ye please,
A hale, shtrong malm iv sivinty-sivin ! ”
Need it be added the case was closed—
“ Settled,” of course, in a friendly way?
Can it be hoped, if so disposed,
Dan may return to Austra-li-a,
Here again lo flourish his hat,
Air his Beard, his Brogue and Cigar ?
Will he take u* apart for a friendly chat
And tell us the Tale of the Motor-Car?

BATTLESHIP BELLS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London, Feb. I.—The death is announced of Rear-
Admiral Sperry, of the United States Navy.— Cable.
While the slow years their giant circles roll
On towards the hour of victory or shame,
Death of the White Sea Legion takes his toll,
And leaves the foeman nearer to his goal
By one more sword-blade—one more honored name
Upon the heights we watched his resting fleet,
And of its greatness spoke with reverent lips ;
Along the tide in solemn notes and sweet
We heard each ship her iron sisters greet.
Who can forget the bells of battleships?
Around the world those mellow voices told
The flight of Time—not shrilly as in fear,
But tenderly in notes of liquid gold ;
Well-armed and watchful, they could never scold
A careless coast, those sisters strong, austere !
Now he is gone who led them out in pride
Across the blue arena of the sea !
No more his flag will call them to his side,
Or drive them forth to span the conflict wide !
One seaman less —the battle yet to be !

HEADACHES,
Like many other human ailments, have been
wrongly diagnosed and altogether misunderstood.
The headache itself is not the thing to treat, for
the reason that it is simply a symptom and is
wholly dependent on the action of other organs.
Not infrequently the direct cause of headache is
an inactive liver. If you are troubled much
with headaches, then try Chamberlain’s Tablets,
the reliable, tried and true liver medicine that
sets that organ right. One box is medicine for the
whole family, and costs but Is. 6d.*
Gout and Eheumatism.
These complaints arise from the poisonous waste
matters accumulated in the blood consequent on
the kidneys, through temporary disorder or
through some disease, being unable to carry out
their work. Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills rapidly reach
the root of the trouble and soon afford relief.

INDIGESTION FOR
OVER FIVE VEARS.
O
This woman had a Miserable
Existence*
*
Cured after everything else failed
by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
*
After putting in five miserable years with indi-
gestion, Mr 3. David Watt, of Perkins Street,
South Townsville, Queensland, was cured by Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills. That these pills have cured
a very large number of sufferers from indigestion,
who have publicly spoken of their cures in the
newspapers, is the highest recommendation they
could have. The following statement was taken
down word for word by a reporter who interviewed
Mrs. Watt :
“Some years ago indigestion came on me by
degrees and I was a confirmed sufferer with it for
over five years. My food began to disagree with
me. I found it lying heavily on my chest and
causing quite a tender aching pain at the end of
the breast bone and running right round to my
shoulder blades. I only found relief by retching
up the little I had swallowed, and there was
hardly a day when I could keep it down. I could
not wear a belt or any tight clothing, I would be
so distended with wind for hours. I was as thin
as a rake, as you may say ; my clothes fairly hung
on me. My skin was a saffron color. I never had
an hour’s peace. I slept restlessly at night, and
woke up heavy and drowsy with my tongue coated
and my mouth tasting nasty. Mv heart would
palpitate furiously if I walked a few yards, and I
would have to stop and get my breath in gasps.
My head was always throbbing furiously in the
forehead. For days I would hardly eat a morsel.
I had to get in outside help to do the housework,
as I would be fit for nothing. I would faint off
sometimes and a cold perspiration would breakout
all over me. I was so low spirited I would sit and
cry for hours. I went to doctors, and tried many
medicines without getting any relief, but I am glad
to say my health was restored by Dr. Williams
Pink Pills. Little by little my appetite improved
and the chest pains wore off. I kept on with them
and never looked back. My health since I took
the last box has been perfect. I filled out and got
a healthy color, and now I can eat whatever I
fancy ivithout suffering. I also tried them for two
of my children with good results.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
The craving for importation recently led
certain Victorian authorities to buy a couple of
dredges abroad. Neither of them ever turned up.
Dredges are not intended for long sea voyages,
and any importing crank who induces them to go
on such adventures is liable to find himself some-
thing little short of a murderer. The Melbourne
Harbor Trust’s pair of vessels—the Walrus and
the Octopus—evidently wentdown with all hands.
After a bitter fight at law with the marine insur-
ance co., the Trust recovered something—exact
amount unknown ; but that doesn’t help the dead
people very greatly. Wlmt is the matter with a
100 per cent, duty on imported dredges?
The Australian (Sydney) Gas 00. is quite
a saint these latter, Labor days. It was different
when Labor was merely able to run and yap at
the wheels of the coach. A sample of the co.’s
modesty in those days-—only a very few years
back, too —was its proposal to the Royal Com-
mission on city improvement, when, in estimat-
ing the compensation required for the resumption
of the Kent-street premises, it coolly asked, not
only for the price of the present site, plan and
premises, but for that and the price of a fresh site
as well. Said Henry Gorman, one of the Com-
missioners, to the co.’s secretary :
Having paid you £125.000 for the site on which the
works now stand, you cannot expect us to buy you a new
site?. . . If we were to resume your house at Ashfield
for some public purpose, we would not pay you for that
house and also give you a new one at Struthfield?
But Mr. Lukey’s reply was that that was just the
idea he intended to convey. Now things are so
changed that, on occasion, the co. even says:
“ Well, we’ll refer the matter to Mr. Watson.”
THE AUSTRALIAN SNOWBALL.
Unless the Federal Labor Government
develops a little more interest in the tariff, even
at the expense of worrying a little less about
coronations, there will be trouble ahead of it. It
stands for a party which has done its best to
shove up wages, and in some cases it has shoved
recklessly. For instance, the Victorian boot-
maker has had his average pay put up from 425.
to 545. per week, which looks pleasant. But
there has been no increase in the wretchedly
inadequate tariff, and the rise of wages has raised
the price of the local boot just high enough to
enable the importer to climb over the stunted
barrier. So now the Victorian bootmaker has so
little work that in many cases he is worse off at
545. per week than he used to be at 425. That is
the one-eyed sort of arrangement which is only to
be expected when the Labor Attorney-General is
a mere slave to the importing interest, and unless
someone gets to work pretty quickly with a
remedy it will probably cost a heap of votes at
next election.
“Red Tape Junior” : The Sydney
Water Board players are on a bad
wicket. The Service has a regulation
which reads that after 20 years’ toil
you may get six months. Note the
“may.” When Wade was up against
it on the hustings he reached out for
the Public Service vote with the un-
expected statement that the public ser-
vant was not merely entitled to six
months (leave, not gaol, I should have
said) during his life, but he was also
entitled to it after he was dead. In
other words, Wade’s theory was that if
a 20-year public servant succumbed
without having taken his long leave,
then his widow was entitled to its
cash value. The Service glued
on to this statement: it forgave
Wade everything—or nearly
everything. Half a year’s
salary at death without
a penny to pay for pre-
mium ! Whether Wade
meant it or not, the Ser-
vice kept him to his word,
and is now busy trying to
persuade McGowen that his
predecessor’s word is holy and
his bond sacred. Well, the
Water and Sewerage Department
apparently had a poor idea of
Wade’s opinion, or believed that
he was merely fishing for votes,
or something ; so it did a dirty
trick. It referred the matter to
Jock Garland, barrister-at-law,
for counsel’s opinion. Now, Jock
was Minister for Justice in
Wade’s Government; and Gar-
land advised the Board not to
pay. So the Board won’t pay. J
It would have been interesting to
have heard Jock’s opinion if the
Wade Government hadn’t been thrown
out. With Wade saying “Yes” and Gar-
land saying “No,” things would have been lively
up at the Crown Solicitor’s.
Sydney Daily Telegraph has a good deal
of bad luck. Last Friday it printed an article,
asking Sydney to go and kick itself for not letting
Private Enterprise do various things for it in the
past—including the bridging of the harbor—and
pointing out how beautiful and comfortable P.
Enterprise would have made things by now.
Treading on the heels of that article was one
pointing out what a horrible mess P. Enterprise
had made of various things it had been allowed
to do around the harbor, and calling on the public
to spend vast sums to repair the damage :
People get their first contact with the city at Circular
Quay, and what do they see ? A shoreline promiscuously
occupied by buildings of variegated architecture and in
various stages of ugliness, altogether a ragged spectacle,
suggestive of a community too hurried, too indifferent, or
too deficient in taste to clear up its litter or lake a
thought of appearances. And when the new arrival lands
he steers his cityward course past skin warehouses On one
side of the bay, or through drays and dust on the other.
It was bad luck—to write a beautiful article about
the advantage of leaving things to Private Enter-
prise, and then find another, dropped just after it,
shouting “ Yah ” at the top of its voice.
H. D. Morton, M.L.A., has spoken a
fragment at Kempsey (N.S.W.) about the Re-
construction policy which folk of his kind insist
on calling Unification. A bit of his fragment
follows:
Another country which is overburdened by this ex-
cellent system of central Government is Russia, where
the blood of humanity runs in rivers.
And a country which carefully avoided centralisa-
tion was Poland, where some 300,000 noblemen
were a law each unto himself, and somehow
Poland faded off the map. Other non-centralised
States were Anarchy, the Kilkenny Cats and
Chaos.
Sydney Daily Telegraph is, of course,
disgusted with the Labor League’s Conference.
Dear Mr. Holman and dear
Mr. McGowen are State
Frighters, and the Labor
Conference, being Australian,
told Holman and McGowen
some plain truths. Said one
prominent leaguer : “ If Mr.
Holman wanted greater free-
dom, he could find it inside
other parties.” Says the
D.T. : “ There it is in a nut
shell. Mr. Lamond and his
friends must do the thinking
for Mr. McGowen and Mr.
Hqlhnan. It is tyrannical,
vindictive, unreasonable,
and” (blessed word!) “un-
constitutional.” And all be-
cause some people said that,
if McGowen and Holman
disapproved of the Labor
party, their proper course
was to leave the Labor party.
The D.T. said exactly the
same thing lately about
David Storey and his friends
and the “Liberal” party,
and when they did leave that party, the D.T. said :
“ All right; you are marked for slaughter.” But
that wasn’t tyrannical or vindictive, or unreasonable
or unconstitutional. It was just the discipline that
the highest conception of patriotism demanded
from any honest party, or words to that tall-
sounding effect.
A NEAR TIDING.
BILL: “I hear your missus, has presented yon
with twins , Jim!”
JIM: “Very nearly, be cripes! She went within
one of it.”
After the repeatedly expressed fears that
the machinery for attracting immigrants would
break down somewhere, it has turned out, as
usual, that Private Enterprise has collapsed first.
Though the Murray State hasn’t shown any tre-
mendous haste about having lands ready for in-
tending settlers, so far it has managed to cope
with the demands of those who have arrived ; but
Private Enterprise has failed to do so, and the cable
tells that Victoria is losing settlers through their
inability to get passages. Yet if anyone suggests
a State-owned line of mail boats. Fat straightway
splutters that “ Private Enterprise, can, of course,
do the thing much better.”
There was a small strike on the Mel-
bourne wharves the other day, and the Argus
was moved to sympathise snufflesomely with the
self-sacrificing worker and expatiate on the loss
he would have sustained had he continued his
self-denying policy. Every time men knock off
work in order to get better pay or conditions some
Fat paper breathes into their ear the same yarn
about their losses. For a change, why doesn’t
the Fat paper breathe the same yarn into the ear
of the Fat landlord? “Here,” it might say,
“ you’ve got a house empty. It’s been empty
for months. You’re losing £1 a week. You
want 255., so you shut it up. You can get 20s.—
why don’t you take it ? What a fool you are ! ”
If that cock will fight, an attempt is ap-
parently to be made to get the Labor people to
start howling at the “undemocratic” Senate—
the body for which every adult Australian has a
vote, whether he or she has Propputy or not.
For the present, however, it is pretty certain
that that cock won’t fight. Labor has some-
thing better to do for a few months: it has
the job of removing the control of industrial
legislation, monopolies, etc., from State Par-
liaments, each of which includes a House rep-
resenting Propputy and nothing else. After the
Labor party has rescued these concerns from the
various State Houses of Fatmen, it will be quite
time enough to consider whether Billjim, the
Tasmanian Laborite, should continue to have four
times as much voting power as Moneybags, the
Sydney coal-mine owner.
From the Young Soldier :
Australia’s fixed port defences are not for ornament;
and in their present state they are not useful either.
For instance, Port Phillip has four military stations
which nominally protect the channels leading to Mel-
bourne. At Queeuseliff some attempt is made to man all
guns with a full corps of gunners ; but at Fort Nepean,
Fort Franklin and South Channel Forts there are not
enough to man more than four out of the 22 guns. At
present Fort Franklin (Portsea) is in the anomalous posi-
tion of having more officers than privates. Nevertheless,
on a recent Saturday afternoon and Sunday, men were
drafted across to Queeuseliff to maintain the supremacy
of the R.A.A. at cricket, leaving three officers and the
canteen attendant to look after six or seven guns. The
military launch Mars has, in fact, made special trips
across to Portsea to take one cricketing’ gunner to Queens-
cliff. These forts are getting in smaller and quicker-
firing guns, and one has to know a good deal to use them
effectively. The R.A.A. gunners will therefore have to
re-learn much of their artillery drill, and this cannot be
done while ability to hit or howl or kick or punch a ball
is the chief thing that’s looked for in the model gunner.
The women’s branch of the N.S.W. Libe-
ral and Deform League has got busy, and dis-
tressed females from the city are talking to their
benighted country sisters and telling them of the
smash and ruin that will follow “ if the Federal
Government controls everything from one centre.”
Passing over the trifling fact that the Federal
Government doesn’t propose to control everything
from one centre, the distressed females might
drive home their argument by pointing to the
shuddersome failure of the A.M.P, Society,
which does business in every nook and
corner of Australasia and controls it from Sydney.
Then they might instance the tremendous dis-
aster which happens every half-year to the Bank
of N. S. Wales, which also controls business all over
AustraliafromGeorge-street, Sydney. The horrible
chaos that springs from the attempt of the
Colonial Sugar Refining Co. to do business in
more than one State might also be pointed out.
In fact, these»distressed females will scarcely be
able to move without tripping over some Fat
gentleman who has to put up with the privations
of wealth just through doing business in more
than one State.
The decision of Melbourne Harbor Trust
to have one of its new dredges built by the
N.S.W. Works Department (the other is to be
imported from Holland) recalls a tariff anomaly
which seriously affects the iron trades in Aus-
tralia. There is a heavy duty on much of the
material which the N.S.W. Works Department
will be driven to import. But the finished article,
the dredge ordered in Rotterdam, will be admitted
duty free. It is a flaw in the Tariff schedule
which can’t be mentioned too often in the hearing
of the Fisher Government.
Now that the great deviation is finished
and £1,000,000 worth of N.S.W.’s permanent and
reproductive Zig-Zag has gone into the waste-
paper basket, it almost looks as if the Sydney
city railway was possible at last. For 30 years or
more the old Zig-Zag was a curse. For 25 years
it was known to be an absurd and loony mistake,
just like Sydney’s Central Dead-End Railway
Station. But there wasn’t enough loan money to
build all the railways that were wanted, and it
was regarded as immoral to build one or two out
of revenue, so the Zig-Zag remained to block
traffic and add many thousands a year to the cost
of haulage till the other day.
What a tragic spectacle is the confused
female Liberal who states on a public platform
that she is opposed to the Labor party “owing to
its tendency to Socialism,” and, being asked for a
definition of Socialism, hurriedly answers : “Ask
Senator Pearce ; ask Mr. Fisher ; ask Mr.
Prendergast; they will tell you ! ” At an alleged
Liberal “rally” in Fitzroy (Vic.) last week, a
Mrs. Berry, who spends considerable time
fighting the Sosh tiger, when asked to describe
the beast, hobbled out of it in the above manner,
and then denounced the derisive ones in the audi-
ence for their want of respect to a woman. Hardly
surprising to read that, when the chairman ap-
pealed to the meeting for fairness to the speaker,
there was an answering chorus of groans. Con-
sidering the speaker’s want of fairness towards the
meeting, a few groans were excusable.
Hay (N.S. W.) offers another example ofttie
land-monopolising curse which the Graduated Tax
is designed to sprag. It was the first inland town
in the Ma State to acquire a decent water supply,
and this was followed by the installation of septic
sewerage, as a result of which the town is one of
the healthiest in N.S.W. These things were done
in the days when Hay was surrounded by small
farmers. But after a while the Tysons of Cies-
wfck, the Naughtons and the rest started buying
out the little men, and desolation commenced to
settle on the go-ahead place. The process of
absorption has continued, until where there were
once dozens of holdings there is now only one;
and where Hay had formerly hundreds of
families to trade with, it novv has a few stray
boundary-riders and station cooks, with the
natural result that the township’s own population
is steadily dwindling, and the voice of the auc-
tioneer hardly ever ceases.
THE MEETING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is to be a meeting of State Premiers to organise
the opposition to the referenda. —News Item of October
last.
Mr. Kidston and Mr. Murray met yesterday and dis-
cussed the referenda. —Neivs Item of last week.
’Twas a damp and cheerless meeting.
Premier Weary’s hearty greeting
Had a mirthless sound,
Ividston glanced around.
Where were all the other fighters?
Where the band of staunch State-Frighters?
What a sad and mournful story !
Oh ! what thoughts of vanished glory !
Where was Wade, his tin sword waving?
No one came from South Oss. raving ;
Groperland was dumb.
Why would no one come ?
And, instead of columns (leadtd)
With the largest black type headed,
Shrieking news afar,
Tiiere was just a par 1
Who was audience? Who presided ?
Points of order who decided?
Mayhap Kidston started weeping
When he saw his comrade sleeping.
So, when ends the comic meeting,
There is nothing- worth repeating—
Nought but grief and gloom
Filled the silent room.

ROBUR
Mamma sent me to the shop
foi Robur tea to-day, and the
man gave me some what wasn t
Robur. Mamma said: “take it
back, and tell him if he does not

not buy any other fings from
him.”
He was a naughty grocer

QUALITY—BUCHANAN WHISKY
“BLACK & WHITE.”
A WOMAN'S
LITTER
Sydney, February 6, 1911.
My Dear Arini,—
An acquaintance just returned from London
babbles pleasantly about an association called the
Souls. 1 can’t quite make out whether it is still in
good going order ; but, at all events, it was flourish-
ing very recently. The Souls are spiritual, intense,
passionate, and filled with a far-away expression.
They have Deep Thoughts—so deep as to be
almost bottomless, though I don’t suppose there
are any fish in the abyss. And they swear off
small, sordid considerations, like a certain shrill
poet once played by Dot Boueicault when he ran
his show at the Criterion. He was telling his
family troubles to Brough, an old lawyer and man
of the world. “When we married we agreed
to abjure everything that was mean and
ordinary and commonplace,” he said, his words
scuffling out like a drove of galvanic rabbits.
“Then we went to live in Paddington.’’ And
Brough, as the wise old shark, repeated the
statement gravely : “ I see. You agreed to abjure
everything that was mean and ordinary and com-
monplace. And then you went to live in Pad-
dington /”
But this is a digression. The Souls (Mrs.
Prime-Minister Asquith was—or is—one of them)
are an ethereal crowd. Etherealness is their
strong point. They don’t eat sausages or pork
pies. If one Soul asks another Soul what
she had for breakfast, and the second Soul
replies: “An egg beaten up,” the first Soul
says, with a shudder: “How gross!” and
passes on. Butchers’ wives, boarding-house
keepers and mothers of ten policemen are not
eligible to be Souls. These quaint but first-class
folk recognise beauty in unexpected places. In
fact, the recognition of unsuspected beauty is
their long suit. When it heaves in sight they
stop short, assume a fixed-deposit sort of expres-
sion, and seize the air with both hands. One of
them recently brought up with a crash against the
atmosphere right opposite a battered and uncom-
promising old peeress—one of the kind who likes
to have the beer brought in a jug so that she can
froth it up personally with a tablespoon.
(I learnt that from my laundress.) She brought
up with a crash against the atmosphere, as
already mentioned, and gazed ahead like a
kitten gazing hard at the fourth dimension.
Then sne approached the battered peeress like
one who totters perpendicularly in her sleep.
“Your Grace,” she said, “ you are indeed beauti-
ful.” “ You hussy,” said the lady, who liked to
froth up the beer in the jug ; “ if I had you alone
I would box both your ears.”
If ever I become very rich I am going to London
to find out all about the Souls. Then if they have
any fixed premises I will acquire the building ad-
jacent—acquire it regard less of expense—and there,
with malice prepense and biliousness aforethought,
I will start a feminine club called “ the Carcases.”
To be eligible it will be necessary to be affluent,
red-faced and vast in the circumference. Prefer-
ence will be given to butchers’ wives and mothers
of ten policemen. The club will know no poetry.
It will drop its “ h if possible it will drop it
outside the door of the Souls. And when the
meeting of the Souls is in full blast the rival insti-
tution will fry tripe and onions over a portable
stove, and let the breeze of it drift through the
ventilator. I never expect to be so madly affluent
that I can spend £lO,OOO on a joke, but if I do
find myself with all that money to waste I will
spend it on the Souls.
According to Mr. George Musgrove, Miss
Stewart’s manager, the real rulers of Maoriland
are the hired girls. At least theirs was the only
rule of which he was always conscious. Actors
and their managers are not, as a rule, early risers ;
and the “ After nine no breakfast ” notice weighed
like Ossa on Musgrove’s weary soul. One morning,
after the fatal hour had struck, Musgrove went
out from his hotel to hunt something to eat. He
wanted fish and all around him the quarry,
in its raw state, was in sight. Walking into a
shop that proclaimed itself as supplying
fresh fish and meals at all hours, Musgrove asked
the man behind the flounder : “ May I have some
breakfast—fried fish?” “I haven’t any fat to
fry it with,” replied the man. “ Well,” said the
hungry one, pointing, “there’s a butcher’s shop
opposite.” “Would” you expect me to go for
fat?” asked the schtiappers’ caretaker in cold-
storage tones. For half a second Musgrove
thought of going for the suet himself. Instead he
strodejout of the shop and into another. This one
had “Welcome” overthedoor; andon the window,
beautifully written in soap, was the intimation :
“Fresh Fish Cooked at Any Hour.” A young
woman, with the eyes of a grazing cow, stood be-
hind the welcome, the soap and the counter. To
her the eager Musgrove: “I would like some
fish—fried or grilled, please.” “Oh, we don t
keep fish,” answered Ox Eyes; “ but I can sell
you soft drinks.” Pointing a finger of scorn at
the ultimatum in soap, the manager asked:
“Then why have you t.iat falsehood on your
window: ‘ Fresh Fish Cooked at Any Hour?’”
An expression of human surprise came into the
bovine eyes of the woman. “ Oh,” she mooed,
“is that what it says ? We have been here only
three weeks, and that notice was there when we
came. You can’t read it from inside, and when I
was outside I never noticed it; but I’ve often
wondered why people come in here asking for
fish.”
The manager comments that he doesn t suppose
there is more mental clod-breaking to be done in
M.L. than elsewhere, but when a man is hungry
the work is harder.
Miss Nellie Stewart and her company ought to
be well qualified as guide-book compilers by the
time they have compassed the tour which began
in Maoriland and is now resuming in Tasmania.
In that island, famous for the production of the
fruit “ that brought death into the world and all
our woe” (Milton— and probably incorrect in
application, for the Tasmanian apple may not be
related to the Eden variety), Miss Stewart will
“do” nine towns. In Victoria she will give a
treat to 30. N.S. W. will welcome her in 40, and
Queensland in 20.
The Hon. Edward Courtenay Haworth Leslie,
an uncle of the Earl of Rothes and one of Syd-
ney’s little-known Debretters, passed unobtru-
sively over last week. He married a Miss
Biddulph. of Shoalhaven (N.S.W.), 20 years ago,
and had lived in this State ever since.
The Dudleys won’t be with us for yet another
pair of months.
Mr. and Mrs. Dick Horsfall got back to Sydney
last week, after spending much time in Europe.
She is the handsome daughter of Fosbery, M.L.G.,
and he will inherit the million or so made on
Widgiewa and other classic sheep-runs.
Mr. “Sep” Kelly, one of the extensive “Tin”
Kelly family, arrived on the Malwa. He is a
pianist of some note and a one-time Diamond
Sculls winner.
Lord Dick Nevill has just left us. He came
over from Melbourne on the Malwa, and returned
aboard the Orient boat last Saturday.
There is a Dalton party at the Australia—Miss
L. Dalton, of Duntryleague. Orange; her sister,
Mrs. McKillop, widow of Willie McKillop. Nation-
alist M.P. for North Sligo; and Miss Butler.
Duntryleague is the town in Munster, Ireland,
from which the Dalton family hails, the family,
driven from Ireland by the famine, arrived in
Sydney in 1840, and at once pushed over the
mountains to Orange, where the father opened a
store with son Janies—the present head of the
family—to help him. Then gold was found at
Ophir, and the Daltons began to prosper amaz-
ingly.
Mr. G. B. Edwards, M.H.R., whose fearful
death has shocked Sydney, was a bookish man
who married into a bookish family. Mrs. Edwards
is a sister of Miss Peacock, who runs the Roy croft
Library in Hunter-street.
To give the weather its due, there is plenty of
sunshine about this washing-day—Monday, Feb-
ruary 6. It blazed out so as to let David Jones,
Ltd., show their new season’s goods to ad-
vantage. Their invitation view begins to-
day. Coat's of thick, hand-knitted, cream
and colored silks were new to most viewers.
Skirts of the model frocks are nearly as narrow as
when hobbles were worn. Less than two yards
wide, but cut straight, most of them. A black
tunic, fine as a mist, was embroidered, body, skirt
and sleeves, with huge trails of milk beads. There
must have been pounds of milky glass hanging on
to something that looked as unreal as a few yards
of atmosphere cut out of the middle of the night.
The next freak fashion will be the bird petti-
coat. It is to be a skimpy garment with a deep
flounce, and reproduced in natural colors on the
flounce will be birds of every sort and hue.
Stockings will be en suite. For morning wear the
humble house-sparrow will, I suppose, perch on
our stockings. For a concert, canary birds, no
doubt. This fashion may be expected to catch
on tightest in wet weather ; for i(; would be such
dreadful waste to have an expensiye.fowl blushing
unseen on one’s underskirt.
“Behind the Scenes in the Dressmaking
World” is the title of an article in the Pall
Mall. It deals with the work'of-some of the
great designing houses in Paris, especially with
that of Cal lot and Poiret, two studios thatare
more than usually fashionable this year. The
designer of . dress models suffers nervous p;ings
when she or he exhibits work to fellow workers,
just as an artist does when his picture goes before
the hanging committee. For mere public opinion
these designers care nothing. Evidently
tingaled and sheath skirts won the critics’ ap-
proval. Clever saleswomen can impose almost
any freak on the public. Most of the fashion de-
signers pass through the art schools, and a few
big dressmaking houses have good reference
libraries to help them further. Then there are
designers who give themselves to the study of old
church embroideries, old laces and tapestries,
which they set their embroidery-makers to copy.
But the very air of Paris, says the article, seems
to be filled with clever thoughts on dress, and
some of the behind-the-scenes workers, who come
out of grey, sordid surroundings, have an astonish-
ing sense of color, and weave things of beauty out
of such materials as oilcloth, strings, buttons and
the like common materials.
Which reminds me that in the new season’s
goods opened to-day at one of our big Sydney
shops is an embroidery for tailored frocks made
principally of rubber and straw. The rubber is in
little bead-like bits and of its own slate-pencil
hue, and the straw is amethyst or violet. The
remainder of the braid is like black silk crochet.
“ The lace-makers,” continues the article in the
P.M. "stand quite apart, for they generally in-
herit the gift nowadays. One of the largest lace
makers in France told the writer that he has
women working for him who have eight genera-
tions of lace-makers behind them. It takes at
least three generations of lace makers to make a
good one.” The lot of the workers in the dress-
making places is not so bad. Anyhow, the
majority of them would not change their lot for
any other, unless it were a beau mariage , and in
this particular they grow most difficult to
please. One clever little designer the writer
knew was earning £3O a month. “Sales’
also are well paid. Some earn salaries running to
between five hundred and a thousand a year.
Mannequins get about a hundred a year, and
the average wage of the girls in the atelier is
four-and-six a day. The least of them seems to
have a natural talent for handling chiffons.
In the same magazine another writer credits the
homeless, rich American with being the primary
cause of the “ huge extravagant hotels, out-
rageously palatial.” now found in every
great city in Europe. The fact of Ameri-
can millions “pouring unhampered by here-
ditary obligations into their opulent laps has
set a reckless pace for the world at large. These
outrageously expensive hotels are crowded with
homeless rich—mostly Americans, bent on having
a “good time.” Their women seem to exude
extravagance. Most of them wear some £23,(XX)
worth of jewels at dinner, and the dinner itseil,
without wines, would come to about 255. tor
each diner.
••Who is that standing over there?” asks
someone in a hotel corridor.
“It’s a Doucet dress and a Rebouxhat? I
don’t know her name,” was the reply. She would
be one of the “homeless rich.” Did any ot
us Australian innocents ever realise that the
increasing mania among fashionable women tor
being quite slender was one of the great elements
of waste? “The real secret for losing flesh, re-
marked one of the skeleton adepts, “ is to come to
the table without any appetite and to go away
hungry.” Yet the mditre cl’ httd must make out
his menu just as elaborately as ever. One of the
homeless, thin, unknown ladies bought a house,
and her neighbors, piqued by signs of colossal
wealth, condescended to question the ash-man. 1
can’t tell you who she is,” he declared ; “ but her
swill is magnificent.”
What a study will be the hordes of homeless
rich, both English and American, who will flock
to London for the Coronation and fill up the
super-fatted palace hotels !
Under the headings of “Effect of Hobble
Skirts,” “Failure of a Petticoat Company, ’ a
London paperreportsadebtor’s public examination
in court. Uesaid that the failure of his company,
which carried on business as petticoat manufac-
turers, was due to a change of fashion. Women
had given up wearing petticoats, and his business
disappeared. Clearly, the wearing of the tight
skirt and the craze to appear slender are wide-
spread calamities.
Mr. Dan O’Connor, who, by a recent cable,
would seem to have got damages from one Kilby,
of London—the latter’s motor-car smote Daniel in
the public street, occasioning him mental, moral
and physical damage—is doing pretty well out of
his miseries. The other day a French countess or
princess or something broke her plighted troth to
Dan. He sued her for breach of promise, and
secured a sufficient sum, by way of damages, to
keep him in wine and cigars for the rest of his
life. Then he joined the Imperial Pioneers. The
Pioneers are a species of elderly Boy Scouts.
Their deeds of valor are performed, not in the
tented field, but on the public platform. Dan got
well egged for his pains. But there was money in
it; also a modicum of that fame which is second-
cousin (four-times removed) to Glory. In the
heart of a nation which is drifting rapidly towards
the vortex of what our local dailies term “ Protec-
tionism,” Mr. O’Connor remains the sturdy Free-
trader he always was. He went Pioneering on
the Universal Service ticket alone.
A Sydney storyette, now being over
although it occurred some time agone. There
was to be a great Review of the Forces,
preparatory to which it was usual for Colonel
Blank’s orderly to clean up the Colonel’s uni-
form. On the morning preceding the great event
Mrs. Ironjaw Blank came into the yard and saw
a gunner leisurely brushing a pair of military
pants. The lady was disgusted with the way he
was doing it, so, with much vigor and strong lan-
guage, she took them from him and showedhimhow
the work ought to be done. W hen she had become
dirty and moist she returned the pants with the
remark, “ That’s how the Colonel wants them
done ! ” “ Excuse me, madam,” said the gunner,
“but they are mine!” That orderly got a free
discharge within three minutes, with less red tape
than had ever been used before in the service.
Revised version of the O’Connor-Castles Merry
Widow Co. Mr. David O’Connor incepted (no,
not intercepted) the revival, and he and Mr.
George Castles are putting their own red gold into
the venture. Also, Mr. O’Connor has done
more than understudy Higginson in the r6le
of Danilo. He has portrayed the flirtatious
Danilo in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide,
and has been publicly complimented on the
stage by J.C.W. for his rendering of the part.
The Firm has yielded the two young guardians of
the Widow her original scenery and costumes ; a
good orchestra will be included in the venture,
and several members of the original co. will join.
Young Nicholson, who gave such excellent comedy
account of himself in the operations of the
Petersham Amateurs, has also been annexed by
the O'C.-C. pair. They are not yet sure whether
Eileen Castles will join their co. or- go into
J.C.W.’s employ. She is on the Otway, by which
liner Mr. Williamson is also returning here.
Mr. O’Connor began his comic opera career
some 13 years ago with the Pollards in M.L.
Then he went to London, studied with Santley,
joined the Bandmann Opera Co., did pretty well
a world’s tour with that group, and presently took
over from Bandmann a disbanding company and
toured it through India, China, Japan and Java.
So he is not quite a bantling among theatrical
managers.
Miss Elsie Una Roberts, a pianist of Truman
production, is to have a first recital at the
Y.M.C.A. Hall on the 16th. Otherwise concerts
are as rare as sunshine in Sydney just at present.
Mr. Hugh Ward must feel like recommending
Fate for at least seven days’ hard for attempted
arson. About the time he was getting his face
into a mask of grease-paint for the first
night of “Seven Days,” at the Palace, his
house at Double Bay had begun to burn merrily.
Gas left burning in the bath heater was the cause,
However, various fire brigades with cold cascades
quenched the conflagration after it had damaged
a few rooms.
Miss Josephine Marks, a handsome Sydney
girl, well known here as a soprano and much
addicted to singing for charities, will give a con-
cert in the Town Hall at an early date. A meet-
ing to arrange will Vie held at the Australia on
Thursday, the 9th, at 3 p.m. Miss Marks is bent
on European study.
Until quite recently the name of Maudi Darrel
was well known on the London Gaiety stage.
She was a dancer who never showed her legs.
Pantalettes to the ankles intimated, without pub-
lishing, her lower supports. Miss Darrel married
a few years ago a Mr. lan Bullough, of some castle
in Scotland, and a few weeks ago her death
occurred at her husband’s donjon.
Miss Burrows, of the Girls’ Realm Guild, is
back from a trip to the United Kingdom, and
from trying to enlighten its ignorance about Aus-
tralia. One man said : “An . Australian ? Then
you know all about horses and dogs? ” “ I know
one from the other ” was her reply ; “ that is all.”
Societies in England are more numerous than
religions. “ The Society for Providing Christmas
Dinners for Poor Horses,” especially took the
Sydneysider’s fancy. The guild pet, Eva Cham-
pion, is reported as progressing capitally in her
singing work.
lam sorry—more sprrv than I can say—to read
in a London paper of the death of “Senator
Stephen B. Elkins, cetat. 70.” My grief is not
personal, for I never knew the Senator ; it arises
mainly from the following, which occurs in the
obituary notice :
His death probably removes the last obstacle to the
marriage of Miss Kate Elkins and the Duke of the
Abruzzi.
But a month or so ago I told myself cheerily that
the interminable Abruzzi-Elkins affair had finally
and for ever sizzled out. It appeared to be as
surely tombed as Mr. George Reid’s Socialistic
Tiger. Now the whole dreary business—the
Duke’s frantic dashes to and from Washington
(U.S.A.), the objections of his female relatives,
the haughty protests of Miss Elkins’ female rela-
tives, the Duke’s heart-broken exploration trips,
the ancient controversy as to whether Miss Elkins
has or has not gone over to Rome—bids fair to
recommence. And all because an American poli-
tician omitted to keep alive !
Jezebel’s husband, the late King Ahab, got a
free advertisement the other day when some scien-
tists, whilst searching in Samaria, found 100 clay
tablets, one of which was an invitation to dinner
or something of the kind from an unknown
Assyrian king, and the other an inventory of the
furniture in Ahab’s palace. In those fine, spacious
days you bought your stationery at the State
brickworks, and carried it home m a hod. Also,
when the frolicsome young woman of the period
decided to secure a young man and settle down,
she didn’t sit before the fire one winter’s night
and burn her giddy love letters one bv one.
Instead, she stealthily borrowed the coal-hammer,
and went out and worked like a stonebreaker till
the tile was safely smashed.
The fancy socks contest is the latest idea for
brightening up the twilight gipsy tea among the
sand and ants. The serving-rnaid of a friend
appeared radiant the other morning at breakfast
time witli the intelligence that her brother had
won the prize offered for the most thrilling socks
worn at a harbor picnic. The triumph was
achieved by buying some extra brilliantly-pat-
terned hosiery and having it further decorated at
home by a skilful and enthusiastic sister. From
another source comes the story of a jaded youth
who, on being reproached for appearing in public
wearing black socks, remarked sadly to a friend :
“I simply don’t care now, old man! I find I
can’t worry about my socks like 1 used to ! ”
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHL

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, February 6, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Governor Carmichael, clad in a khaki suit,
and buried in a khaki petrol car driven by a
dust-colored shover, dashed up to Parliament
House one recent hot morning. lhe khala
Governor hurried up the stone cataract of steps
followed by a khaki secretary bearing an im-
portant-looking bag of papers. They disappeared
through a side door of the deserted House
while the shover, who had just steered the chariot
from the slopes of Macedon, mopped his brow
and looked fondly down Bourke-street. Next
morning the papers announced that our only Car-
michael would shortly be leaving us to go and
govern Madras. It will be a knowledgable
Governor who leaves here in May ; since the well-
liked Hopetoun departed, we have not had a man
who was so eager to get round and see things for
himself.
Last week whilst Frank Clarke was hosting the
G.-G. at Thule, in the Riverina, his neighbor,
Norman Falkiner, had the much-travelled Car-
michael for guest at Berricoota. It was a sort of
joint-stock hospitality. The best duck shooting
in Victoria is claimed for the district; and Duncan
Mcßae, Everard Browne, Harold Armytage a.nd
others shared in the awful slaughter. Meanwhile,
the woinenkind of both hosts were at Macedon
helping to put to gastronomic uses any dead birds
that oame their way.
The Countess is taking a fresh interest in her
infant Bush Nursing scheme now that the Car-
michael lady has resuscitated it. She is accom-
panying Governor Carmichael and his lady into
the wilds of Beech Forest to see that the first
nurse is comfortably fixed.
The Admiral and officers of the French flag-
ship, now under orders to return home, are being
feted and dined at high pressure in Melbourne by
their compatriots, and the streets are full of
sailors in red top-knots. The long, grey Montcalm
seems able to conoeal myriads of them. The
deck is a vast promenade; there looks to be
enough room on it for a regiment to parade. Our
party had a French escort, whose password acted
like magic when sentries were encountered. Every
minute or so as we trooped along a fei’ocious sen-
tinel, with a long lance, presented the point and
exclaimed “Storp !” That one word of English,
learntfor a purpose, broughtthe procession to a halt
till the guide uttered his incantation. The torpedo
room was absorbing. A handsome torpedo man
discoursed with sparkling eyes and descriptive
gesture in French hopelessly tangled up with
technicalities. But the youngest girl of the party
just looked at him dreamily, and said she under-
stood perfectly. The poor man who actually
launches the deadly engines is really only a
machine himself; he never has the satisfaction of
seeing where the torpedo goes or how much damage
it does. He works blindly according to orders
transmitted to him by indicators from the lucky
man on the bridge, who sees everything and gets
shot at by everyone.
The party got past even the last and most fero-
cious sentinel, and was shown the very last hope
—a steel-caged space in the bowels of the ship.
It gave one a vivid idea of the horrors of
modern naval warfare. When the rest of the ship
is smashed, the men fight from this hole.
The steel-plated walls are lined by indica-
tors showing every move ; there is steering
gear that has been kept separate from the
steering gear above; finally, there are the guns
and torpedoes that may be worked from the
cage. The remnants are supposed to do their
best in this last ditch until the ship is sunk —steel
cage and all—or blown out of the water.
The officers are great dandies. All uniformed
creatures are—naval men especially. But the
natty Frenchmen are really dazzling. In the
inner den, right among the murderous machinery,
was a small mirror carefully placed. There was
one man who, I am sure, would carefully brush
his whiskers before he went down—or up. He
had the real French pinky-red auburn hair; and
his pink-red whiskers were parted exactly in the
centre, and brushed back with a saucy, brisk tilt
on either side of his chin. His white lounge
clothes might have been cut out of polished
alabaster.
The French residents of Melbourne dined the
Admiral and his men at Menzies’ on Saturday,
when the big, new room was fluttering with red-
white-and-blue-flaglets.
Toorak and South Yarra are spending their
days cleaning the carpet and shovelling silt off
the verandah; also the defunct dog and the
drowned hen are being hurriedly put under-
ground. All this bother because another playful
waterspout chose this drenched city to fall on.
At Collingwood the small boys had a swim with-
out having to go to St. Kilda. The Tram Com-
pany is thinking of fitting paddle-wheels on the
cars for crossing flooded streets. This is the
second cloud-burst within a month, and southern
suburbs are sick of it, and will take their capital
out of the country if things can’t be managed
better.
The disturbance on Sunday was responsible for
some grim comedy out Haw-Hawthorn way.
When the deluge was at its top, sundry coffins on
the premises of a local undertaker left their moor-
ings and drifted about the neighborhood ; and the
resourceful small boy utilised one of the craft
to ferry stranded passengers across the turgid
waters of Burwood-road. Simultaneously, the
undertaker’s wife was seized with sudden illness
of a serious nature, and the doctor who was called
by telephone had to be forded across the torrent
by the local first-aid corps.
Miss Yvonne Scott was married at Berwick,
just as January was fading off the almanac, to
Harry Walstab, son of that Walstab who was so
often Mayor of Brighton that it may be said to
have been one of his habits. Sister Mrs. Willie
a’Beckett lent the bride a wonderful bib of lace
for the wedding veil. Artist Pen Boyd, also of
the a’Beckett clan, supported the bridegroom and
looked after Miss Ashalie Scott, who carried the
bride’s gloves and other paraphernalia. Berwick
in its entirety came to the joining at Christ
Church, and looked on while Captain Watson
handed the orange-blossomed bride over to the
fortunate man.
Miss May Hepburn was married, the other day,
to artist Norman McGeorge at Trinity Church,
East Melbourne. The marrying followed the
most up-to date fashion ; only the most intimate
friends of the newly-weds were bidden to the
ceremony. Everything was the blue color of del-
phiniums—those sumptuous flowers that once were
modest larkspurs. The decorations were delphini-
ums, and thebride’soutfit wasdelphiniumblue; then
at the Vienna, where the party had afternoon tea
and wedding cake, Mrs. Hepburn McGeorge had
bunches of delphiniums at every guest’s plate.
Blue, blue everywhere —except that a small aris-
tocratic terrier, belonging to the bridegroom,
came to the marrying wearing a white satin
bow After the "ceremony, m the march
down the aisle, the bridegroom tried to lead
his dog by a string, but it pranced joyously
ahead of the procession, wagging congratulations.
The honeymooners have departed to the Southern
Lakes that twist round to the Ninety Mile Beach.
Nellie Mackenzie and Miss White acted in an
impromptu sort of way as maids-in-waiting.
The bridegroom gave them each remembrance
stones-bits of lapis lazuli set in silver. Katherine
of Russia had a room lined with the lovely blue
gems for her blue-eyed lover Orion. it is a
weird stone, the lapis lazuli; it is as blue as
the Indian Ocean on a good poet’s day, yet when
split up into fragments the reason of the blue can-
not be found.
Collins-street medico Eccles gives away daughter
Muriel, on the 30th of this month, to Alan Oiblin,
of Hobart. The ceremony happens in bt. John s,
Toorak.
There is an original feature about the Alfred
Hospital Bazaar—the nurses themselves are
engineering a stall. This shows real grit and
energy. The average hospital nurse can hardly
find time between work and rest, even for a flirta-
tion, let alone the work of getting up a whole
stall-full of material and then selling it.
The Mayoress of Prahran and her people are
piling up a mountain of sellable things for their
pitch. P’ran practically owns the Alfred ;so the
Donald McKinnons and other prominent folk of
the shoppy suburb are assisting their Mayoress
and working hard for a brisk, money-making
show. The Pierrots of the adjacent St. Kilda
beach charitably donated a nights’proceeds—quite
a conical hatful of cash—and poured it gaily into
the coffers.
A country stall is to be a sensible novelty of the
Alfred Hospital Bazaar. Sympathisers in the
districts where the cow and the hen grow wild
can then help things along by sending eggs, butter,
honey, bacon, chooks, and other rural luxuries.
With an army of housekeepers living round about,
the fresh produce is sure to have a good sale.
Miss Jeanne Czavkowski, a Polish journalist,
is carrying that swag of syllables around Australia.
She alighted in Melbourne for two days, and
then went on to Sydney. In Melbourne she
walked right into the Tourists’ Bureau, where
“Teddy” Boyce answered the fusillade of ques-
tions she fired at him. Then he put on his hat
and piloted the traveller round the city, showed
her its spires and foundations, caught important
people on the hop and made his lady known to
them. Miss Jeanne wants to inspect the whole
continent. She counted on getting through in
two or three months, but admits, after the glimpse
Tourist Boyce gave her, that she can’t see how
the job can be done in less than a year. (How
refreshing this is after the dust of Frosty Fraser !)
She looked round the principal libraries and
visited the University, where she applauded de-
lightedly when she discovered that Wyselaskie
Hall was the donation of a fellow Pole.
Colonel Stanley has been laid low in hospital
for an operation. He is recovering, however, and
will soon be in the 4 o’clock parade in Collins-
street. One misses the Colonel. He has such a
surplus of inches above the ordinary six-feet limit,
and holds himself so straightly amongst the desk-
bowed city people.
Osborne O’Hara is coming back to Melbourne
after gaining knowledge in an extended stroll
abrawd. Osborne is the darling of the amateur
theatrical fashionables, for he is a real grease-
paint champion and puts a deal of cleverness into
his stage work. Some of the acting youths are
busy preparing an extra-fine show wherein the
returning star is to twinkle.
Bobbie Jackson, the sassiety youth adored of
skaters at the Glassy Harum, gave his gifted
understandings some congenial work by under-
studying a Hielan’ dance in “The Gay Gordons.”
Then his principal thoughtfully had a sick spell,
and Robert did so well that he was “ placed ” for
“ The Gay Grisette.” It is an ill principal that
blows no compound interest to his understudy—
or words to that effect.
Women are barbarous creatures. The screwed-
on earring has, however, saved lots of women from
the ear-piercing ordeal which was part of the old
barbarity; but the loss of odd earrings, acci-
dentally detached by the tug of a veil or scarf, has
worn the temper of the decorated sex to shreds.
The new fashion of wearing “odd ” earrings con-
soles many bereaved owners ; as a rule, only one
earring is lost at a time, and the owner of a stock of
gauds can wear the survivor with any other old
survivor she has on hand. To avoid this fashion-
trick, however, the majority are going back to the
old ear perforations. Recently I met a pretty
woman with her small pink ear inflamed and
swollen. “ Dreadful, isn’t it ? ” she wailed. “ But
look at these! ” and she brought from hiding
some diamond and coral trifles. “I simply
couldn’t afford to lose these !” Pierced ears were
a sign of slavery or wifely serfdom in primitive
times. The boss of those days got the newlv-
acquired woman up against his door lintel and
punched a hole through the lobe of each ear.
Metal rings were then attached and the decora-
tions were complete. The boss refuses to do the
barbaric job any more, so his lady has to do it
for herself.
The debt-laden Dominion of Maoriland is
always ready for an expensive splash. The other
day High Commissioner Hall-Jones puffed out
his chest and announced that Maoriland would
spend £lOOO on a triumphal arch at Coronation
time. I wonder will they build it of frozen beef.
Canada’s wheat arch of years ago was, I believe,
admired by hungry thousands. The same people
—rather more ravenous by reason of the flight of
time and trade—are still available.
A Coronation departer is Mrs. Annie Turner,
the spookist of Fitzroy. She leaves on the
Otranto in March with her family and “Pro-
fessor” Abbott, her manager—nine voyagers in
all. The lady recently became acquainted with
a new spirit-guide (one Betsy, a Lancashire lass
of the last century); and W. T. Stead, hearing of
the occurrence, became consumed with the desire
to meet Annie or Betsy, or both. After giving Bed-
stead what is known in spiritualistic circles as “an
intro.” to Betsy, Mrs. Turner will pass on to
Jerusalem, thence to Salt Lake City (U.S.A.),
and so back to Australia.
The Ullathornes have been thwarted in a third
attempt to jaunt to England. Their first failure
was a stroke of luck, for they had booked pas-
sages in the Waratah, when business happened to
save them from the trip. Then they got away in
the Pericles and were wrecked ; and now the
illness of a little daughter has stopped them again
after they had booked passages in the Malwa.
They are nursing the invalid at Heidelberg. Tak-
ing one consideration with another, the Ulla-
thornes’ luck may be considered more out than in,
although their escape from the Waratah trip left
them with much to be thankful for. In fact, if
they had not missed the boat that went down
they would not have lived to enjoy any subsequent
misfortunes.
At Coronation time Mrs. George Keppel will
be tooting around Colombo in her motor-car, or
hiding her light behind a cocoanut palm, .tier
car and chauffeur went Ceylon-wards on a recent
liner ; but the car got badly smashed en route, and
will take some surgeoning. Mrs. Keppel, by the
way, was the unconscious cause of a hard blow to
one Australian girl in London. The girl s fathei
had been a friend of old Chappell, the big music-
man, who had given her a teaching-room rent free
in the Grosvenor-square building. Lately, it was
decided to turn the upper floors into a palatial
flat for Mrs. Keppel, at a cost running into five
figures, and, amongst others, the girl from Aus-
tralia had to go; so she bears a personal grudge
against the unconscious evictor.
I am reminded of Kipling’s “ Second Voyage .
We’ve sent our little Cupids all ashore—
They were frightened, they were tired, they were cold ,
Our sails of silk and purple go to store,
And we’ve cut away our mast of beaten gold.
Shipbuilding has not got to the gold-mast stage
just yet; but the firm of Vickers, Sons and Maxim
is building & war airship of the finest silk on a
framework of aluminium—which substance does
not rhyme as easily as gold, but is almost as dear.
The airship is an expansive and expensive lady;
her dress takes 46,000 yards of silk at a guinea
a yard ! The British Admiralty is the official
husband of the extravagant jade.
Bertram Mackennal, the Australian who
modelled the portrait of King George on the new
coins now trickling into circulation, will not be
able to complain of public lack of appreciation of
his work. Everyone wants as many replicas as
he or she can collect.
A wonderful business palace is to be the talk of
London next year. The “ New Whiteley’s” will
cover a four-acre site, and include almost every-
thing, from a wireless station to an Italian garden
on the roof. There will be a playground for
children, with all sorts of playthings and heaps of
sand to build castles with. Reading-rooms, rest-
rooms and a cafeare mentioned as matters of course.
There are to be hundreds of telephones and an
information bureau, and (at last!) smoking-rooms
with all sorts of comforts intended for men who
are waiting for their women-kind to get through
their shopping. In fact, almost the only things I
can’t see mentioned are a divorce court and a
laundry.
A lady-upholder of that remarkable institution,
the Wimmen’s National Limb, whilst endeavor-
ing to address a crowd at Fitzroy last week, was
hoist with anew and original interjection. The poor
woman was trying to tell the meeting that Labor
would regret the 13th of April, when a loud voice
advised her to “Go home to your Teddy bears!”
In the adjacent suburb of Richmond, some years
ago, a flushed and solemn chairman, after many
vain efforts to secure silence for his candidate,
rose to his feet and held up a large, red hand im-
ploringly. Instantly there was a curious lull;
then a shrill voice shrieked excitedly : “ It’s the
Benediction /” That interjection finished the
meeting and the chances of the mute, inglorious
Liberal on the platform.
The Kew Canoe Carnival—which takes saying
—is becoming quite a hardy annual. Blatchley, a
Canadian-Australian who is full of enthusiasm for
sport, from indoor skating to canoeing, is
the chief engineer of the show, which is to
happen on the Yarra, at Kew, where
that maligned river flows between beauti-
ful banks covered with picturesque herbage,
and big gums. An entertaining and well-decorated
show is promised, and will happen (water-spouts
permitting) on Saturday, February 11. The
affair is cheerfully libelled in advance as “an
annual treat for Kew and Yarra Bend Asylum
patients”; but some hundreds of other lunatics
at large go along yearly, to watch the slim craft
gliding and the paddles flashing in the sun.
From “ Rosna,” of Adelaide :
Our Admiral has been disclosing his cricket form. The
other Saturday he and some allies from his mountain
home took on the champions of Basket Range, and were
conquered. As a salve they were refreshed with some of
the best buns in the district.
There were races at Victoria Park on Monday in the
heat wave.. Two fat dividends —one of £l5, the other of
£2o—cheered the steaming racegoers. The Excellencies
were there, looking as pleasant as the hot, horrible after-
noon would allow.
Elma, daughter of cattle-man Syd Kidman, is to wed
Sidney Reid, of the Malcolm Reid family. The date of
the affair is not yet fixed.
Bishop’s Court, which has housed our gaitered divines
for over half a century, is for sale. A humble red-brick
palace—at present in the making—will be used instead.
The first Bishop’s Court, by the way, was a six-roomed
cottage at Kensington.
Sydney Sun, writing of Miss Amand Wright, lately at
the Science Congress, mentions that she is a member of
the Poetry Recital Society, “ which numbers nine Ade-
laide poets among its members.” And we didn’t know
we had ’em !
Last hot Wednesday night the Shakspeare Theatre
people presented some slices from “ Macbeth ” and a
plavlet written by that clever amateur mummer, Wilfred
Neill. The fragment was palpably suggested by Wilde’s
“ Dorian Grey.” Also, the plot was unnecessarily
laid in London —a handicap to the show in a com-
munity which is hungering for Australian drama.
Maude Plunkett, Douglas Walshe and the author did the
acting.
The politico-squatter folk, Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Duncan,
their two sons and two pretty daughters, left by the
Mantua on an eight months’ pleasure hunt. They return
through Canada and America. Mr. Duncan inherited
Hughes Park from his uncle, the late W. W. Hughes. It’s
a charming old homestead up near Watervale, and the
family dwells there when it isn’t decorating Sassiety in
town.
The same vessel removed the veteran machinist, A. W.
Dobbie. When not machining, he is a floriculturist;
also he dabbles in the occult; moreover he is on terufe
of intimacy with most of the stars and planets. He has
a private observatory in his garden at College Park, and
before departing he lent the Government Astronomer two
champion telescope mirrors, in case the City of Culture
decides to send anyone to superintend the eclipse of the
sun at Tonga in April.
The municipal Cohens will be away from Adelaide only
four months. They propose to dash back from the Coro-
nation in time to give the usual Mayoral Ball.
By the way, the Dick Nitschkes are returning to the
Cold Isle early in March, a fact which will be hailed with
enthusiasm by the Australian student throng on the
other side. Their house in London was a haven—and at
times a hospital—to numberless home-sick, failure-sick
art-aspirants during the years they dwelt there.
The dearth of Maryannery is becoming such a solemn
matter in South Aus. that frenzied marms are bidding
furiously for the first refusal of the services of the Coro-
nation gadders’ left-behinds. An offer of four figures a
year can’t assure you a Mary who doesn’t want every
night off, as well as Saturday and Sunday afternoons.
One well-known local dame declares she will do her own
Mary-Anning now and for ever more. She and her hubby
—a childless pair—entertain much and informally; but,
alas, always in the hours which every Mary has marked
as her own. The housewife reckons that if she is to open
the door to, and wait upon, her guests every evening, she
might just as well open the door to the tradesmen and
wait upon herself during the day. For her recent partiel
she has been getting excellent suppers, with waiters
attached, from a city restaurant, and paying for them
with the non-existent Mary’s keep, salary and breakage
money ; and she declares she is having a life of peace, for
the first time in years. A few others, who can’t cope with
the'sifcuation and breakfast chop, are trying-dusky Maries
from the aboriginal stations.
An Adelaide musician, interviewing prospective aids
for a delicate wife, nearly engaged a perfect jewel, who
only wanted four nights off and Sunday out. But she
stipulated for an hour a day to practise her violin. He
regretfully turned her down.
When women get into Parliament a severe and com-
pulsory uniform will have to be invented for them, or
there surely will be ructions. The newly-formed Liberal
Union, with adesire to rouse its fearsomely lax voteresses,
had a woman’s meeting the other night, with Grace
Watson to speak to it about the Referenda. The speaker
arrived in a fresh, much-tucked muslin dress. Further-
more, being a Queensland salamander, she was looking
perfectly cool and undisturbed by our puny Adelaide
heat-wave. This so irritated one woman present that,
when questions on the Referenda were invited, she asked
Miss Watson how much she would expect to be paid for
washing and ironing her dress. Miss Watson said as
much as she could get, but the questioner wasn’t out for
information. She was merely suffering from a burst of
■natural feminine rage against the one cool person in a
heated atmosphere.
An ancient land-mark, the Windsor Hotel, which has
cheered the thirsty traveller on the North-Enst-road for
30 years, was burnt to the ground in the middle of the
heat-wave. The old Windsor was five and a half miles
out of the city, too far for the kind attentions of the fire
brigade, so only a beerless waste of blackened walls is left.
Sincerely yours,
J OHANNA.
“ Horatio Breathless ” : Let us alter it to
“ The tomb is not yet ripe.”
Melbourne Chamber of Commerce is work-
ing up a big testimonial for Dr. Wollaston, who
was longtime the local Comptroller of Customs.
Wollaston is regarded as one honestly deserving
of the substantial compliment.

.22 CALIBER CARTRIDGES
pgp ms^
Different makes of cartridges look very much alike, but
you don’t buy cartridges for looks. What you want
is efficiency. That’s why you should buy Winchester
Cartridges. Winchester .22 Caliber Cartridges, Shcrt,
Long and Long Rifle, either black or smokeless powder,
are loaded by automatic machinery, which insures their
always being sure fire and of full strength, which means
accuracy and power. The smokeless cartridges are loaded
with Winchester Greaseless bullets, which are clean to
handle and prevent loss of powder strength. It is easy to
be a penny wise and a pound foolish in buying cartridges.

HAVE YOU PILES?
Remarkable Cure Effected by Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills.
Perhaps there is no disease more irritating and
annoying than piles. It is the result of imperfect
circulation of the blood. The venous blood settles
in the veins of the rectum, and expanding these
veins produces.the nodules known as piles. Ihis
is sometimes produced by an inactive liver, which
does not permit the blood to return freely to the
heait; sometimes it is the result of a weak action
of the heart itself, and often it is due to large
masses of faeces lodging in the bowels and pressing
upon the veins, so that the blood cannot return to
heart and lungs. This disease is not only most
painful, but also very dangerous, as the inflamed
nodules are very apt to take on malignant action,
and cancer of the rectum is produced. Dr Morse s
Indian Root Pills, in their action on the liver,
heart and bowels, strike at all these causes of piles
and remove them. “I have been a resident ot
Oamaru for 26 years, and for many years I was
employed in the Railway Department, writes
Mr. D. M. Blair, WansbackStreet, Oamaru, JN./-.
** Some years ago through frequently getting wet
I became subject to piles. I tried many remedies,
but none have given me more relief and had more
permanent results than Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. The bleeding and dreadful itching which
disturbed my sleep night after night was speedily
overcome when I commenced using these pills-
Mv wife was a martyr to biliousness, but vr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills have entirely rid her of
that trouble, and a pill taken occasionally has had
a most wonderful effect upon her health. We both
recommend your valuable remedy, and you may
use this in any way you desire.”*

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Huo-h J. Ward’s success with the Baker and
darken reward fund has moved him to greater deeds. Not
content with having rewarded the men who saved life, he
is now on the warpath to raise funds for the women the
drowned ones left behind them. Two of the men left
widows, one of them a stranger from England without
relatives here. Furthermore, there is a child coming
home, and money is urgently required and a fair
amount of it. The other woman is the mother of
the brave little lad who said he was all right, and told
the rescuers to goon and save the women.. She is a widow
also, and that plucky boy was her principal stay. Mr.
Ward proposes to get up a matinee or some big show in,
perhaps, the Town Hall on, sav, Saturday week. Mean-
time cheques, postal notes and other valuable tender are
earnestly requested. #
Since the Coogee surf mishap gallons of ink
have been used in suggesting bow to prevent similar dis-
asters, and at time of writing there is not the slightest
sign of any of the ideas being put into effect, in fact,
nothing has been done ; and unless someone does more
than write to the newspapers about it, nothing will be
done. One useful suggestion was that someone—munici-
pality, Government, or Tramway Commissioners—should
supply a small, speedy motor-boat, capable of run-
ning through the breakers, to cruise just beyond
the line during bathing hours. Certainly the
people to put up the money are the ratepayers of the
municipality and the ferry and tramway people. The
ratepayers at Manly, Coogee and other places where they
drown bathers are getting fat on people who go surfing.
Half these suburbs are boarding-houses, all charging the
residential surfer at least 30s. per week, and rooking him
for extras as well. Only one thing will make the local
party voluntarily shell out, and that is the drowning
of some Eminent Personage. It’s all very well
for Hugh Ward to raise thousand-pound funds
to reward rescuers ; but what is wanted from
that energetic gentleman is some action to prevent
rescues being necessary. If Ward desires to go down in
history as a man who did real good for his fellow men,
he will raise a fund for the drowning of an Eminent Per-
sonage. This would give Mr. C. G. Wade a chance also.
He might consent to crown his Mt. Kembla heroism with
immortality by allowing himself to be drowned for th. e
purpose of impressing - on ratepayers in surfing munici-
palities that they are a mean, penny-grasping crowd who
have no regard for the wet, partially-dressed person who
is making them wealthy.

The way Hugh Ward worked up the public
interest in his big show at the Stadium was immense. He
cmfided to a newspaper man that he had been something
of a don with the gloves in the past, and would take
part in the show if he could find a partner who would
make a reasonably willing go —a go sufficiently
willing to electrify the public. Then he discovered
his grievance against Baker: “It struck me this
fellow * Snowy ’ Baker was looking for trouble,
and he went on to complain of Baker’s rudeness. When
after much talk of morgues, etc., they met in the ring at
the Stadium, one of the best representations of a whirl-
wind fight ever seen in the place burst on the startled
spectators. It was excellently do ne - Presently Baker
was seen to suddenly go right over and land
on his feet, after being apparently knocked
through a complete somersault. Just for the
benefit of the people who come from where. jokes are
never understood, it is hereby announced wiih official
authority that Hugh J. Ward and “Snowy” Baker are
the very best of friends. It is not true that they are
both training for another scrap, and it is also untrue that
Ward chargees Baker with having set his humpy on fire
while he was grafting.
*.* * *
“I).”: Some time ago Dave Smith and Billy
Papke agreed to fight for the Middleweight Champion-
ship, and Smith lodged £lOO to bind the contest. But he
stipulated for ringside weighing. Whereupon it was
alleged that there was “absolutely no precedent for the
position Smith had taken up, and if the match which he
appeared so anxious to make did not take place, it would
be his fault,” Yet Smith is palpably in the right. He
undertakes to fight at the middleweight poundage—not
to be that weight an unspecified number of hours before
he enters the ring. To the bosh about “precedent I
reply, “Rats!” It is a recognised physiological fact
that a trained athlete puts on weight with extraordinary
rapidity, because his tissues are in a condition to greedily
absorb eyerj-ounce of nutriment that comes their way.
Thus boxers who have been formally, weighed and have
afterwards eaten and slept well, have frequently stepped
into the ring fully half a stone heavier than the}'were
eight hours previously. The pug who claims to be a
middleweight champion as a result of winning a contest
which he actually fought as a heavyweight, is a plain con-
fidence trickster. The contention that a boxer may be
weak from wasting, if he is forced to weigh at the ringside,
and that he should therefore be allowed to weigh hours
beforehand, is strangely absurd. If he is suffered to weigh
at 12 noon on Saturday, why not at 12 noon the previous
Friday or Friday week ? Why an honest middleweight
should give way in this matter to one like Papke, who is,
properly speaking, a light heavy-weight, doesn t appear
i,o the type of citizen who is not irrevocably wedded to
precedent, custom and the “proper thing.”
David Smith, Australian pug, continued his
career of conquest on Monday night in his postponed
battle with “Cyclone” Johnny Thompson, the 12st.
“ lightweight,” of Chicago, Yankeeland. A shocked moon
peeped out occasionally and then withdrew hurriedly, and
there were fears of another sudden downpour. Smith, as
before mentioned, is rather a handsome boy. Thomp-
son isn’t. And his home-spun appearance served
as quite a foil to Smith’s beauty. Johnny s
Maker was dreaming that He was back in the Mesozoic age
when He fashioned Johnny, and sent him into the world
armor-plated to do battle with the monsters of the
Jurassic seas, so that if the saurian smote Johnny s jaw
withhistail.it was the tail that would be broken. Jf
a man hit him with a hammer, it would be necessary to
get a new implement before putting up a. hatpeg.
Not onlv was he made hard for defence, but the Lord
deprived him of his neck so that it might not get broken.
He also gave him the least possible nose that a man might
breathe with, so that if it had to bend under a
blow, his granite face w-ould rescue it before it
was bent to breaking point. He gave Johnny
■dgantic shoulders, vast hitting powers, and Cyclo-
pean hips, where a mass of toughened muse e
makes him strong for the rough and tumble
wrestling to which Yankee boxing has degenerated. And
all these things the handsome Australian youth found
himself up against. One morning paper said Smith was
heavier than Thompson ; but in this writer s opinion it is
the other >vay about. And, anyhow, in hardness and
strength there was a vast gap between them, and the
margin was all in favor of the Cyclone. #
“ Cyclone ”is evidently a joke. Johnny is not
cyclonic : he’s glacial. It was said that, before the fight
the American had remarked that he expected to get,
chopped up for six rounds, and then he’d start to land a
few on his own account. And, sure enough for six
rounds lie got chopped up. The opening was ah\ aj s the
same. Thompson would whirl up his arms and walk
into battle deliberately. Smith would amble
across and hit Thompson right on what point Johnnj s
nose had. He did it regularly, and nevermnssed a round.
He pounded Thompson’s face with right and left, ana
blinded, but could not disconcert him. That
Yankee bored in resolutely, looking for the chance to
swing his sledgehammer right. The chance never came ;
although he swung it often enough, it always failed to
land Had it done otherwise, Smith would
have vanished. In the fourth he just grazed
Smith’s nose and chin, and got s oundly
slapped for his effort. Smith’s footwork was
beautiful, and the way he bashed Thompson
in the face was beginning to interfere wit h the
lie-lit By the end of the sixth round Thomp-
son couldn’t breathe through bis nose, and as
lie lumbered round the ring trying to get
Smith into position to be killed, his wind could
be beard whistling through his teeth. In
the fifth Thompson started to wrestle ;
it was quite evident he had realised that
his only chance of winning was to bore in,
worry his man and knock him out. Also,
he nearly lost the fight on a foul. In the
tenth he almost got his chance, but missed;
and as he was being smacked he brought a
right smash that dropped Smith. Smith took
the nine seconds, and then got up and showed
some of the prettiest of blocking. In the
eleventh Thompson made a desperate effort to
knock out, but only got pasted. As the end
drew near he increased his efforts. In the
twentieth round the “cyclone” act was in full
blast, but Thompson reminded one moie
of an elephant with two trunks than any sort of cyclowe
we see in these parts.
The decision was the only possible one, in spite
of what has been said about Thompson “ forcing: the
fight.” As he was useless in long-range fighting, Thomp-
son naturally got close. Also, when he stood off, Smith
pounded his weary and crushed snout, until Thompson
felt the thing: would give way. Much as one may dislike
his methods, it is impossible not to admire the
•n it and determination of the man. The way he bored
Fn was magnificent, and his capacity for receiving-punish-
ment is a wonderful and horrible thing. It has
been said that Smith hasn’t a knock-out blow
about him. And on Monday night’s form it cer-
tainly seemed so. But writer has his doubts about
Johnson himself knocking Thompson out. Wallop him
he certainly would —to mush. But Thompson is an
unusually ’ tough man. When we see Smith up
against someone with more of the human about him,
he may appear to be a hard hitter. He certainly seems
one in'his training. As for his rival, he can endure the
worst that can come ; so he puts his feelings aside and
wades in to gfive the killing stroke. Blit Smith took all
sorts of fine care he should not deliver it; and when he
did manage to deliver it, Smith was not there to take
delivery. And one naturally always prefers to see skill
and dexterity prevail over brute force. *
The weights for the Newmarket flutter must
have lift-d a load from the minds of a few rash punters
who had taken fancy prices about three or four of the
entrants before the handicap appeared. Blairgour, the
most talked*of candidate, is let in at Bst. 31b., which is a
comparatively easv burden for a big colt If the son of
Wakeful is nearly as fast as the knowing people assert, he
will, all going well, be backed down to a short price.
Likewise, Mala, last year’s winner, who is another of the
early selections. Mala is very small, and 9st. is commonly
said'to be a big weight for an animal of his size : but six
furlongs is a short distance, and, seeing that he
carried Sst. lib. to an easy victory last year,
the extra 131 b. seems a light penalty. As a
now four-year-old, Mala must be a stronger little
fellow than he was 12 months back. Hoax (Bst. 51b.)
is well treated on her best form. First impressions of
the handicap are favorable to the chances of the top half
of the entrants, two of the least unlikely ones among the
light weights being M’Culloch and the Queensland horse
Cowl, who has escaped with 6st. 131 b., whereas he is
given Bst. 51b. for the Oakleigh Plate. Strange to say,
none of the nags, bar Mala, that showed prominently in
the Newmarket a year ago, are entered for it this time.
The Australian Cup will probably boil down to
a small field for speculation ; but meantime there are
several besides Alawa and Trafalgar with paper chances.
The mares Apple Pie and Lady Lucy should be at their
best, and neither is overweighted. Tanami, in a good
humor, would have a show; and if the grey horse,
Nuwara Eliya, is a candidate for the 2i-mile race, one
would lend a willing ear to good accounts of that hand-
some steed.

The “ sport” of potentates is a wildly humorous
thing. When the bomb-haunted Nicholas visited the
Kaiser recently, one of the entertainments was an alleged
deer hunt. The “hunt” consisted of the royal “sports”
perching themselves on an elaborate structure, sur-
rounded by home comforts, whence minions “shooed”
half-tame deer on to the nozzles of their guns. Before
the royal “ sport ” gave out the butchers had accounted
for nearly 500 carcases. Even the German press became
offensive, and one editor has been “ nabbed ” for suggest-
ing that a cheaper way of satisfying royal ideals of
“ sport ” would be for the Divine William to put in a day
in the Potsdam backyard decapitating the ordinary barn-
door fowl.

“ Dux ” : “ Has anyone ever won the whole race
card?” Yes. A. Whittaker rode all .seven winners at
Huntly (M.L.) annual race meeting last year. The club

Maoriland’s new Gov. Islington is a good sport.
He recently acquired the crack Auckland yacht Viking a,s
a cruiser, and in the same breath offered £3OOO for the

offer. „

For the recently-ended English racing season
Frank Wootton, the Sydney jockey, had the greatest
number of winning mounts, viz., 137. Maher was 10
behind ; but Wootton had 630 mounts in all, while Maher
only started in 460 races. So the English rider had the
greater percentage of wins. Figures for the first four .
Wins. Mounts. Percentage.
D. Maher .. 127 460 27
F. Wootton .. 137 630 21‘7
W. Higns .. 70 . 450 15’5
O. Trigg .. 95 706 13’4
So, good as young Frank is, Maher’s longer experience is
having its sav. For the horses, Lemberg-holds pride of
place "with seven wins, bringing in £23,839. Neil Gow
won only three races, but these were worth £ll,OBO.

“Snaffle” : Yeend, who rode Flying Buck to
victory 52 years ago, in what was known as the Buck
Hunt, is dead. N.S.W. and Victoria had first met con-
spicuously on the turf with Veno and Alice Hawthorne,
Cooramin and. Tomboy, and Veno and Van Tromp. On
that eventful dav, at Flemington, N.S.W. conquered all
round. Afterwards, Tomboy, under Sammy Holmes,
beat Veno. Attempts were made to drag Tomboy on the
stao-e of the Princess Theatre at night, to receive the
acclaims. Orr, his owner, drove him in a buggy for a
number of years after. The next great meeting of the
States was in the Champion Race, three miles, weight
for age ; and it was of this that Yeend was the hero.
N.S.W., Vic., South Aus. and Tassy were all represented.
The Barber was made a bit of a favorite, through having
swum ashore from the Admella wreck, when Hurtle
Fisher and others endured such agony. But J 4 l.\ingr
Buck, ridden by Yeend, was sent ahead at the start, kept
the lead and won easily. Yuille was the owner ;he had
been a pastoraliSt, but became a-turf writer on the Au-
stralasian, as “ Peeping Tom." His son wrote as Play-
boy. ” Yeend was not a jockey, but was taken from ins
Grammar School to ride the Buck. After that, though,
he stuck to horses, and developed the Indian horse trade,
in which he reached the prominence formerly held by
Teddy Weeks. „

Melbourne Age, in an article on “ Abuses of
the Turf,” reiterates the old, old truism that the powers
that be ought to be more honest and more active. Ti.e
fact is laid bare that “some stewards enjoy the privilege
of having a couple of sovereigns with the stable whenever
it scores a win,” which implies that these fortunate
officials are never supposed to have their two » ovs - '
a moke that gets beaten. “Reform says the A«.
“is not likely to come from within. The State
has undertaken to licence racecourses; the State must
accept some responsibility for their good conduct. Jn
the provisions of the law controlling racecourses there is

AND THE STADIUM REFEREE.
abundant power to accomplish the desired purification of
the turf.” But, oddl.v enough, in' the very next column
there is a paragraph which practically sneers at the hope-
ful speculators who invest ss. in Tatt.’s sweep,
under the impression that they are safe from
the exactions of horse-owners in the event of
their five-bob ticket drawing a likely starter. Thus :
“Where no sweep money is forthcoming, owners
prefer to resort to the fatal scratching pen at the
eleventh hour rather than run for unknown people who
have drawn their horses for big prizes, and sit snugly
behind their tickets in anticipation that the owners will
run for the stake. . . . There are owners who would never
think of running their horses, especially when they think
they possess winning chances, unless the ticket drawers
unmask themselves and come forward with inducements
attractive enough to place possible prospective winners
in active commission.” It seems, then, that whilst advo-
cating “ purification of the Turf ” by the State, the Agk
sees nothing immoral in the system of blackmail which
has grown out of Tatt.’s sweep. To swindle the
outside punters by means of “ stiffening ” the runners
in a race is a turf abuse, but to levy a demand
on the possible winnings of sweep ticket-holders, under
threat of giving them no possible chance to win if
they ignore the demand, is a horse-owner’s privilege, lie
is not the w'ould-be robber. The owner of the ticket, who
“ sits snugly behind it,” with a “ mask ” on his identity,
is the person who commits the offence and must be pre-
pared to suffer for it at the owner’s discretion. In this
paper’s view, the horseowner who tries to squeeze out an
illegitimate profit in this way is a blackmailer whose
offence, when proved, should be punished by the State.
It is not even as though the t icket-holder had backed the
horse for a large stake and “spoilt the market.” An
owner has no conceivable sort of claim upon a sweep
ticket-holder —unless he asserts it in the form of black-
mail - *
Maori land has come to the conclusion that Pri-
vate Enterprise management of horse-racing is the Devil,
and has wiped it and the bookmaker out together. Hence-
forth, racing is to be run by a Racing Commission of five
members; and their despotism will exceed that of the late
j. Caesar. All the same, the control of racing has not
been handed over to the Wowsers, and the appointment
of the Commission, which was gazetted last week, has re-
moved a great fear from the hearts of the followers of
horse. Old George Clifford, Bart., is chairman, and
associated with him are men like Alf Cohen and G. P.
Donnelly, the man who was the husband of the late
“Princess” Arini. Any suggestion that that crowd is
tainted with Wowserism is impossible. But though the
Commissioners are straight men, it must be remembered
that they were the forefront men of the old system which
Maoriland has decided was so impossible that it had to be
slain quite dead.

The Springboks made an easy meal of a
Ballarat fifteen. The visitors closed at seven for 455
(Strieker, 146; Snooke, 85 ; Schwarz, 74 not out; Llewel-

an innings and 206. Pegler and Llewellyn accomplished
the hat-trick.

Foundation Day cricket in Melbourne was an
enthusiastic business. G. H. S. Trott, who is nearly 45,
plaved with the exuberance of 15. Appearing for South
against St. Hilda, his record was : Bowling, three for
nine; batting 130 (retired hurt). McCormack, also of
Skinner’s suburb, made 124 n.o. ; Peter McAlister, for East
against ’Rov, was 150 n.o. ; and Spencer clouted 112 n.o.
for North against Carlton. Still another “ not out ” was
Vaughan, of Melbourne, who knocked 112 off the Essen-
don bowling, and gave a bright exhibition in the process.
In fact, at one stage he ought to have been fined for
furious driving. * * *
The sensation of the Vic.-S’African match came
when the Springboks started their innings to the bowling
of Pitcher, of Collingwood, a maiden in “big ” cricket.
Pitcher takes a short run, and bowls a medium-paced
ball, with a peculiar right-handed action. The Victorian
selector, Trumble, had inspected his delivery closely and
was satisfied with its fairness ; also Pitcher had played in
club games before almost every Victorian umpire, includ-
ing Hannah, Barrass and Young, and had never been
called. But when he started to Zulch, Crockett no-
balled the first three balls; the fourth was a wide
and the fifth was no-balled. Naturally, Pitcher retired.
On Saturday Armstrong tossed the ball to him again,
this time at umpire Young’s end. Four balls passed, but
the fifth was no-balled, and as he couldn't maintain his
length while guarding his delivery, he gave place to Arm-
strong. It was unfortunate that having, at 30, arrived
at tip-top cricket class. Pitcher should be thus outed ;
but even Trumble, though satisfied himself, admitted
that his delivery was open to challenge.

Sydney’s First Grade cricket went to mush
through the continuance of rain on Saturday last. Two
matches were postponed, and the rest consisted mostly
of intervals. But in spite of all these drawbacks one
Tozer (a fearful name to carry through life, owing to cer-
tain political associations) heaped up 151 off his own
timber —almost half bis side’s total of 311. Thomas, of
Waverley, also did well with 72 ; and so did O’Neill and
Waddy of Central Cumberland. The O’Neill carried his
bat for 73, and E. L. made 70. But cricket in intervals is
a dreary game.

gear to H. V. Hordern for reclaiming the Sheffield Shield.
Prior to the N.S.W. v. Victoria match, it seemed that
only herculean efforts could bring the shield to N.S.W. ;
and in due time Ho»Jern produced the effort. In the
match Hordern gathered in 13 wickets for 87 runs, and
Vic. fell for 194 and 88. South Aus. and N.S.W. tied in
wins during' the season ; and the winner of the Shield
had therefore to be sorted out on averages, which panned
out thuswise: —
BOWLING.
Wickets. Runs. Average.
N.S.W 60 .. 1634 .. 27-23
S. Aus 50 .. 1586 .. 31 "72
Vic. .. ... .. 74 .. 2400 .. 32-49
BATTING.
Runs. Wickets. Average.
N.S.W 2007 .. 60 .. 33-45
S. Aus 1781 .. 54 .. 32-9
Vic 1832 .. 70 .. 26-17
Thus, while N.S.W. only just led S. Aus. in batting, the
mighty arm of Hordern put the figures safe from the
bowling viewpoint. All the same, S. Aus. went very
close to keeping the bauble in the Adelaide Art Gallery.
* * * *
The only alteration considered necessary for
the fourth Test, commencing on Friday, is to push
Macartney out and put “googly” Hordern in. The
S’Africans will, therefore, have to swallow physic similar
to that with which they have dosed Australia; and, on an
early prophecy, it is possible that the jumpy bowlers
will have full opportunities to splash their “googlies”
in the mud. Nevertheless, the Australian team doesn’t
carry the whole hall-mark bv a long chalk ; and, if the
Springboks win this Test and level matters up, the
changes which will happen in the next team are awful to
contemplate—though absolutely necessary even at
present. # # *
(Jarkeek’s wicket-keeping was of a high order in
the N.S.W.-Vic. match. In N.S.W.’s first innings, only
one bye was allowed in a total of 337 ; in the second in*
nino-s nine lives in 401—10 byes in an aggregate of 738.
On the other hand, Garter (of N.S.W.) allowed 10 byes in
194 and six in 88—16 byes in 282. Carkeek’s good work
should interest the Australian selection committee.
There would have been little grumbling had Oarkeek
been pushed into the pads in lieu of Garter for the fourth
Test.
S. Aus. recently revived its once-populnr
North v. South match to bring out any up-country
novices at cricket. Naturally, the selector for each end
chose the verv best team available ; but there is talk now
of imposing an age-limit. For the chief result of the
play was to show that Angel’s batting and Harry Hay s
fast bowling are the best things in rural circles at pre-
sent- and the former was prominent in Adelaide cricket
years’ ago, while Hay was the destroyer who bowled out
all Lord Hawke’s amateurs in 1903, and (aided by a cen-
tur.y from a youngster called Gehrs) won the match for
S.A., the first time Warner and Bosanquet set foot on
these shores.
* * *
Some time ago the Victorian Amateur Athletic
Association announced that a series of hpert-air bruising
and wrestling competitions for novices would be held early
this year ; but the contests are off for the present. Efforts
were made to secure the saucer track and other
notorious places ; but no could be secured.
Apparently the Vie. Football League’s plan of
seducing four of the leading Ass. teams and thereby
squelching that body, has fallen through ; anyhow, a
scheme for dealing with the semi-professional player is
being submitted to the clubs—which are pretty certafn
to reiect it. The scheme provides that all gate money is
to go to the League, which will credit equal shares to
each of the 10 clubs. Of these gate moneys the League
and the clubs will annex half, for administration, etc.
From the other half each player*—allowing 25 per club
will o'et 108. a week exes,-, and a bonus up to per
annum on retirement from the game, three years
service to entitle to participation. Thu*, if the
gate moneys in the season amount to 410,000, the
League and the clubs would take *5OOO, the players
43750, and £2250 would he left for the retiring bonuses.
The scheme doesn’t seem to advance matters much, as it
still provides that half the total gate-money shall go to the
players (whether as exes, or bonus it equally makes them
professionals), while the other half is to be spent by the
League and clubs in "administration, which pre-
sumably means “boots” and “hot baths, etc. More-
over, the scheme makes no allocation of the large
revenues received from club membership. (Carlton,
f’riristans, received £1053 in 1809 from the sale of mem-
bers’ tickets.) In fact, the scheme doesn t seem to
advance matters at all,
* * *
About those cricket ‘ ‘ extras.” William Swain,
who died at Brisbane lately, once played a match that
was all extras. Swain was a very old stager—born in
1830—and flourished when single-wicket matches (gene-
rally for a handsome wager) were popular. In 18t>l he
played a whole XI by himself—arid won. London Crickkt
revives the story of his game with one Barrett, in York-
shire in 1853. Swain did not make a single run ; and yet he
won by an innings and four. He bowled Barrett out twice
for 0 and 0, giving away one wide in the process. Swain
bowled him for 0, giving away five wides meanwhile.
Apparently the first straight ball Was always fatal, lhe
chronicle in “ Scores and Biographies’’—which is a kind
of cricketers’ bible —declares that the hall never once
touched the bat all through the contest.

YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT A
* SMOKE* IS TILL YOU'VE
tried MY CIGARS
OdAr\,
1"M going to have my Cigars smoked over every
part of Australasia—and the most confirmed
pipe-smokers are going to be the biggest'
smokers of my Cigars, too.
Talk about joy! Why, to sit round a camp
fire, over a billy of tea, pitching to your mates,
6ach of you smoking one of my Cigar®, joy isn't
in it! It’s just simply bliss!
As the yarns go round, the blue smoke
curling upwards in a fragrant cloud, the
smooth cool Havana flavor lingering on your
lips—l tell you, you'll spend some of the
happiest hours of your life.
ħ
Letters are coming in to
me in shoals from all over
Australasia, praising up my
Cigars. Take one I've just
got as I write this, for in-
stance—it’s from a chap on a
cattle station up in Northern
Queensland. He writes:—
“Those DIADEMAS Cigars
of yours are just alright. I’ve
always smoked a pipe—but
no more. Not that I’ve given
up pipe-smoking altogether;
but when I want a real smoke
-—something rich —I light up
one of your DIADEMAS,
and give myself up to its
pure enjoyment."
To make you acquainted
with my Cigars, and prove
their value, I make you this
FREE OFFER of
5 or 6 CIGARS
you may select.
Send for 100 of any of
Remit the amount, and
I will deliver promptly,
postage or carriage paid,
to any address in Aus-
tralia.
Smoke 5 op 6 of them, and if they’re
not superior to most Cigars at double the
price, send the remainder back to me, and
I’ll return every penny of your money —no
charge made for the Cigars you’ve smoked.
My Cigars are made from the very finest
mild, rich mellow Tobacco, the filling or inside
heart of the cigar being all straight long
leaf. The Cigars are hand-made by skilled
workers, and every box has to pass me before
it goes out to a customer; and is guaranteed
to burn freely and draw easily.
There s no “catch” about this offer—it’s just
plain and -honest. To prove it, you can refer
as to my financial position and way of doing
business tp the Manager of the Commercial Bank
of Australia, Collins Street, Melbourne. He’ll
vouch for me.
Send down for a box to-day—once you smoke
them you'll make it a habit, and buy regularly
from me. When ordering, say whether you
like light, medium, or dark colors.

IN BANANA LAND
Things are so good in the North just now
. that even Warrigal has turned Fatman. Chief
Protector Howard reports that in the Hughenden
district ICO blacks have £1282 stowed up in the
bank. Binglii will soon start spelling himself
Bingy.
Two heavy honors fell on the Digby
Denham household one day this week. While
Digby, sen., was being “sent for” to get the in-
vitation to slop about in Premier Kidston’s badly-
busted boots, Digby, jun., was rending the an-
nouncement that he had been chosen as Rhodes
scholar for 1910.
Brisbane papers publish indignant letters
from tender parents who object to subjecting
their boys to military training. One objection
strongly urged is that the system will deter immi-
grants from coming to Australia. And yet it is
nowadays almost impossible to get immigrants
from Germany—a country where military service
has become universal.
The Longreach branch of the A.W.IJ. re-
cently passed a resolution strongly condemning
the Phidston Government for borrowing money
for its proposed railways. If the Longreach Labor
men want to effect any good, the best thing they
can do is ’to put a stiff anti-borrowing plank in
the Labor platform. The plank that is in the
platform is so warped that it allows the Parlia-
mentary party to be borrowers almost to a man.
From the Brisbane Courier’s law report
(23/l/’ll): —
Mr. Dickson, Crown Prosecutor, stated that the
prisoner was a native of Victoria, and in addition to
this offence had committed several others.
Now, have State Frights got into the Queensland
law courts, or is it only the Courier’s awkward
way of putting things ?
R. T. Cassidy, a Queensland drover, has
been 50 years at the game, and is still going
strong. He has never been ill in his life, he says,
though he has waded through scores of floods and
has been compelled to wear wet clothes for weeks.
He pins his faith to the Queensland drover’s life
as the healthiest on earth. He is at 65 as active
as most men are at 40, and often rides 50 miles a
day without experiencing any unpleasantness.
Died at Maryborough on January 28, aged,
72, Captain John Evans, who was in the Queens-
land pilot service for over 40 years. As a young-
ster he was employed helping to carry slaughtering
material from England to the Crimea, and subse-
quently was a member of Livingstone’s exploring
expedition on 'the Copgo. In 1858 he came to
Australia, joined the Bananaland pilot service,
and stayed in it till his retirement, 10 years ago.
“Leo Lear”: Ban Ban cattle station is
the only Australian run I know of that is defended
by a big gun. The weapon—a dumpy, smooth-
bore 4in. cannon—was made back in the years of
George Rex No. 3, and found itself ownerless in
Australia over 60 years ago. A yacht, splendidly
fitted by English globe-sailors, arrived at Glad-
stone, and tied up to a wharf. The tourists
carried the gun to ward off niggers, bears and
other colonial terrors ; all evidently to no effect,
as they fled to Melbourne, leaving the boat in the
Northern harbor, and have not been heard of since.
The yacht lay for years in the road of shipping,
and was finally committed for vagrancy and passed
on to a sandbank, where it rotted away. Forty
years later a Mayor of Gladstone disturbed its
resting place, and pulled up a cannon. This he
presented to Mr. Wade-Brown, of Ban Ban, near
Gayndah, where it remains unto this hour. It is
occasionally fired, much to the risk of live stock
in the rear; it takes a jam-tin full of black-powder,
and bucks up 3ft. 2Jin.
This seems to be a good season for sea-
snakes on the Queensland coast. One was re-
cently caught by fishermen as far south as Nudgee
Beach, near Brisbane. Waite, in his book, “Aus-
tralian Snakes,” says there are 12 different
kinds of sea serpent in Australian waters;
but they are nearly all confined to tropical
areas, where the rum is generally strong
and the whisky frequent. All are highly
venomous ; but they very rarely kill anybody,
mainly because of their rosebud mouths and their
consequent inability to grasp anything large.
“ Leo ” : There is nothing lethargic about
one of Queensland’s summer storms. For reck-
lessness in the home-smashing line,, they leave
Socialism lagging behind like a wet hen. After a
mid-day of heated, vapory stillness, masses of
heavy, cumulous clouds gather out of space.
Then, on the first snarl of thunder, the air cur-
rents break loose, and the clouds cross and recross,
twist and turn, are tossed up and thrown down,
and curl round and over and under. Yet all this
manoeuvring is only a shuffle in the scheme of
cloud concentration. The effects are superb ; and
it Bananaland doesn’t produce the great Austra-
lian cloud-scape artist it is not for lack of en-
couragement. Soon all the forces are mobilised,
and the compressed electrical mass moves slowly
eastwards. The opening bars of the fantasia are
long, reverberating growls, that ramble in a
desultory way over immense areas. Then an up-
ward suck, a hurricane of wind, and the real
thing begins. The sluice-gates are thrown open,
and the earth is scoured to its foundations. The
wind changes from quarter to quarter with the
ease and rapidity of a political opportunist,
driving the deluge into every corner and through
every crack. Stabs of blue, pulsating light, fol-
lowed by thunder that rips the atmosphere, put
the fear of all the gods into the heart of things.
Old-men ironbarks that have withstood the
droughts and storms and white ants of many
decades are torn and battered. Sentinel trees,
receiving a quick perpendicular stab, are reduced
to splintered stumps. Suddenly the disturbance
ceases ; and a dead • calm falls over a soaked and
ragged .earth, while in the distance the ;storm
cloud moves off majestically towards the coast.
“ H.H.” : Whether Premier Kidston just
fell, or whether he was pushed, or whether
the trouble was partly one thing and partly
another, the fact remains that he has handed
in the insignia of his job, and Digby Den-
ham reigns in his stead. That over-rated
produce merchant will probably make a bad
mess of things, and he has men with him who
are well-calculated to assist in so doing. The new
political development ends a series of rather com-
plicated evolutions. First there were Kidston,
the strongly’Labor Treasurer in the purely Labor
Ministry of Andy Dawson, and Digby Dehham, the
Tory. Then appeared Kidston, the hot quite so
strenuous Laborite of the Morgan-Browne coali-
tion and Digby his Liberal colleague.
Next uprose Kidston, the semi-Labor half-
Li beral Premier and his colleague Denham, now
fast relapsing into Toryism, who presently left
him and rejoined Philp and the old gang.
Another shuffle of the cards found Denham
second in command of a Tory Cabinet, and Kid-
ston in Opposition. Presently Kidston, having
become sufficiently Tory to stand Denham’s
closest inspection, became Premier again, with
Digby, the produce man, for his subordinate.
And now Denham is Kidston’s natural successor,
and the Government is old, unadulterated Tory
once more. The new Premier has sat in five
consecutive Ministries, ranging from half-Labor
to wholly reactionary. An adaptable man is
Digby Denham.
SEEKING AN APPETISER.
MOULDY JIM: “I have a poor sick wife at home what has no appetite. Could yer spare me a
trifle, Miss, to yet snthin’ to give ’er a appetite ?”
LADY: “ Why, yes; but what are you going to get her?”
MOULDY JIM: “I’m goin’ to advertise, and get her a job, Miss. There’s nothing like work to
give a woman a appetite!”
J. H. Maynard, who has been head
master of the Bowen Bridge (Brisbane)' State
School for over 38 years, has been given a 12
months’ holiday. He has been nearly half a cen-
tury in the service of the Queensland Education
Department, and was a member of the first staff
of the Brisbane Normal School.
C. W. Mackay, of Dulong, near Nambour,
has patented allying machine. It is fitted with a
pair of wings, one edge of which is straight and
the other semi-circular. The winged seed of the
Queensland hickory suggested the idea. The
hickory seed has only one wing, yet sometimes it
travels more than a quarter of a mile before it
touches the ground. - ,
“Settled”: Some time ago “C.5.A.,”
writing about the probability of a serious land-
slip on the Cairns-Kuranda line, said he was
thinking of cornering the supply of mules—they
would be wanted for packing to the hinterland.
He should start at Parliament. There are plenty
there, easily got, though he might find even more
in the railways office. I came through No. 10
tunnel two years ago. It, was then common
knowledge that the hole was expected to cave in
any day; yet the Department allowed it to
actually fall in before anything was done. There
have been at least six slips since “ C.SiA.” wrote,
and it is expected that it will take tilT'ffast the
end of February to fix things up. When the bad
smash happened a fortnight ago, the Department
made mules of over 40 men, who carried coal and
food from the train to one waiting the other side
of the tunnel. I didn’t hear of any beer being
packed. Since then, the Department has built a
light line over the top, and men drag light loads
from one train to the other. Meantime, millions
of feet of timber continue to rot in the bush and
at the railway sidings. The contractors cleared
big fortunes out of the railway. That may be
partly explained by the fact that, where the
officials expected to find 18 inches of cement, they
meet with only about four inches. Still, the
Kidston Government is credited with an intention
to build the Great Western white elephant on the
same beautiful contract system.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbank, February 4, 1911.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The MacGregors (web-footed by this time, I
feel sure) returned from Stanthorpe show on
Thursday, lam told that the fruit of this garden
of Queensland made such an impression on the
Vision that she had to be forcibly restrained from
taking up land and going in for peach growing.
And she knows a thing or two about peaches.
Speaker Joey Bell’s recovery from the tedious
illness which has had him by the heels since June
last is very, very slow.
The E. and A. steamer Eastern, after sitting
determinedly upon a sandbank in the Ba3’ for a
week, while the crew of frenzied Chows cast
millions of peanuts and sacks of rice to the winds
and waters, suddenly came to the conclusion this
morning that she could hatch nothing but sand
out of the bank, and permitted herself to be
helped off by another lady by the name of Mus-
grave. With her hat at a reckless angle, she is
now staggering up the river to buy a new outfit
and get her face washed. One of the incon-
venienced passengers was Miss Hart, who was on
board, bound for the Chelmsford household in
Sydney. She had eventually to go down by
train.
We have got a new mayoress and, incidentally,
a mayor, and have acquired both of them at un-
usual speed. Usually there is a fortnight’s fight
over the business ; and, then, when everybody is
laid out, the Government has to come in and say
who shall be who. His new Worship is a staunch
advocate of the new Town Hall, and no doubt
efforts will be made again to bring the hovering
scheme to earth. The new man also deals in ink
in a large way, so that he should have a soft place
for the struggling reporter. Mrs. Diddams, what-
ever show her other half may make in the velvet
and ermine, will fill the position to a nicety.
Dark and statuesque, she possesses the art of
wearing her clothes. Toowong houses the new
first citizens, whose name, so far, is the only
visibly-weak link in the chain. Yet, after all, it
is more or less appropriate, for his Worship has a
wheedling way with him.
In spite of the howl that has been raised on the
subject of the referenda, many Queensland busi-
ness men have decided to support the change.
Queensland is not a low-wage State; and, while
it has only the same Protection against the
foreigner as the re?t, it has no Protection at all
against States which now, or in thefuture, may be
inclined to try low-wage manufacture and pro-
duction. Consequently, business men begin to see
that their safety lies in the Commonwealth con-
trol of industrial conditions, so that no single
low-wage State may prejudice the others.
The war which has lately been raging round All
Saints’ Church has now removed itself to the
quarters of the City Ambulance Transport Bri-
gade. The first whiff of trouble was scented
months and pionths ago, and had to do with some
alleged breaches of discipline. The committee
kept very little tact on the premises, and finally
a stand was made by the men against a sort of
polite ragging. Almost the whole of the central
staff has been dismissed or has resigned, and the
task of looking after the damaged population is
left to a much depleted honorary staff, ; where-
fore it isn’t safe to break your leg or chop
yourself with a bread-knife these times.
1 happened upon Horace Tozer yesterday,
lunching with daughter and family Norton. The
old man looks well, and his stories have lost none
of their old snap; but Time has frayed some of
his once very striking physical alertness.
By the adverse votes of women, a clever she-
doctor has been voted out of a billet on the resi-
dent staff of the Brisbane General Hospital. The
head doctor was willing, but the catmittee
scratched viciously and drove the other tabby
off. One particularly nasty claw tore at the
qualifications of the lady medicos who from time
to time have held peaceful sway at the Bowen
Hospital, while another snapped at the “in-
justice” of women going into the healing profes-
sion at all.
To the land of Spars and Swipes goes Mrs.
Denny Day to visit her son, who has been
worthily upholding the honor of Australia in the
way of hustle and sport at college over there.
Mrs. Day is one of our most popular hostesses,
and, as a reward of merit or as a warning to her
friends, has been “ guest of honor ” for weeks and
weeks.
Mr. Fitzherbert, the Martian in the Gregan
McMahon Co. is a young person who, when be
does anything, does it with all his might. In-
cidentally, he can do some of it with both hands ;
partly by reason of which the Pioneer Club is the
richer for an excellent sketch of himself, as The
Messenger, executed with the young man’s left
hand. Members of the firm, under the chaperon-
age of Mrs. Mac, tea-ed at the club last week.
The co., with its pretty little “lead,” has done
fine business in this very damp city. The season
finished up with a creditable outbreak of “The
Two Mr. Weatherbys.”
The Government agent who is to be sent out las-
sooing immigrants to shovel dirt in connection
with the Premier’s Borrow and Bust railway, is
a small, energetic person by the name of Main-
William Main. Also, he is Scotch, so that the
dwellers in the North may hearken peradventure
unto him. The most delighted person over the
whole business is a certain guid mother in
Glasgow, who thus unexpectedly gets back her
bairn for awhile.
There will be another representative of the
Feez clan in Sydney along with this. Miss Elaine,
of the titian hair and nimble piano fingers, goes
down with mother and the smaller children. The
latter are to be put to school.
The Lightollar homestead will open its doors to
a large assortment of folk on the 13th inst. to do
honor to daughter Dicky, whose wedding with
Mr. Murray Prior will follow upon the heels of
the shivoo ; and another tea and bridge gathering
will occur at the Pioneer Club during the coming
week, at which Mrs. E. A. Cullen will be hostess.
Queensland gives its scientific experts little
appreciation and less cash, and has in consequence
lost many of them these last few years. Nqw
Brownlie Henderson is being tempted to follow
Dr. Ham to Melbourne and pursue the germ and
adulteration fiends of Victoria.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
The Phidston Government proposes to
offer free passages to large numbers of European
laborers in order to supply the demand on its
Western boom line. The new-chum navvy who
can battle through a Western Queensland summer,
with its flies, thirst, bad water, sandflies, mos-
quitoes and other insect plagues, will deserve all
he can make at the job. But the chances are that
the hardened old Australian navvy will have to
finish it.
“ Saint Anthony ” from the Far West:—
Be the shocking allegations of the Mother Superior of
St. Mary’s Anglican Home, Rockhampton (B. 2/2/’ll), one
point is worth noting. There are hundreds of women out
here who are, for days at a time, left by themselves in
lonely out-stations and boundary-riders’ huts, and at far-
out coach stages, and who are then at the mercy of the
human beast. Yet, withal, there has been absolutely no
record for many years of an offenhe of the kind inferred
by Sister Mary St. Wowser. We do not deny that there
must be beasts out here ; but they know full well that
the bushman would kill them if they acted according tc
their desires. Mary St. Wowser has been with us for five
years, and we are now immoral, she says. I trust she
doesn’t stay six years.

Attractive—Decorative —Permanent—Economical.
There are two main considerations to be reckoned with when building a home.
In the first place —attractive rooms, artistically decorative, and, as far as possible, fire-proof, dirt-
proof and germ-proof.
In the second place —a good investment. The building of a home is often a costly undertaking,
and the investment side has to he considered. Some day circumstances may necessitate a sale,
and it is therefore necessary to build a saleable dwelling.
In addition to meeting these requirements, WUNDERLICH ART METAL Ceilings become a
permanent part of the building.

With Terrible Eruptions —Grew
Worse in Spiteof Doctors—Would
Scratch and Tear Flesh Unless
Hands were Tied—Mother Says
HE WOULD HAVE DIED
BUT FOR CUTICURA
“My little eon, when nbout a year
End a half old, began to have sores
/V, >
-:r
come out on his
face. I had a phy-
sician treat him,
but the sores grew
worse. Then they
began to come on
his arms, then on
other parts of his
body,and then one
came on his chest,
worse than the
others. Then I
called another physician. Still he grew
worse. At the end of about a year and
a half of suffering ho grew so bad that
I had to tic his hands in cloths at night
to keep him from scratching the sores
and tearing the flesh, flo got to be
a mere skeleton, and was hardly able
to walk.
“My aunt advised mo to try Cuticura
Soap and Cuticura Ointment. So great
was her faith in them that she gave me
a small piece of the Soap to try and
a little of the Ointment. I took them
home without any faith, but to please
her I tried it and it seemed to dry up
the sores a little. I sent to a drug 6toro
and got a cake of Cuticura Soap and
a box of the Ointment and followed
directions. At the end of two months
the sores were all well. He has never
had any sores of any kind since. He
is now strong and healthy, and I can
Bincerely say that only for the most
wonderful Cuticura Remedies my pre-
cious child would have died from those
terrible sores. I used only one cake of
Cuticura Soap and about three boxes
of Ointment.
“I am a nurse and my profession
brings me into many different families
and it is always a pleasure for me to tel]
my story and recommend Cuticura Rem-
edies. Mrs. Egbert Sheldon, R. F. D. 1,
Litchfield, Conn., U. S. A., Oct. 23, ’09.”

“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco
Habit by your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after
using tobacco heavily for seven years, sometimes
Boz. to lOoz. in the week. It is now 12 months
since I last used tobacco, and, although I am con-
tinually in the company of smokers, I do not have
the least desire to smoke, therefore I consider
the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my
former complaints, such as irregular Heart
Action, Dizziness, Nervousness and Stomach
Trouble, which I have every reason to believe
were caused through the use of tobacco, have en-
tirely disappeared, and are only remembered as a
hideous nightmare. I eat and sleep well, and feel
fit to face the world again. It will give me great
pleasure to recommend your remedy to others.”

Fearful Death List amongst Young Men /
The death-list caused by excessive smok-
ing of tobacco and cigarettes is an appalling
one in Australia, where men in thousands
become nervous and commercially-useless
wrecks.
Daily the sacrifice of human wrecks goes
on, the certain system of slow poisoning by
nicotine being proved by the yearly death-
list. Nicotine is one of the deadliest pois-
ons known to science, and no man can be
healthy whose blood is steeped in it. The
nervous system must suffer, as well as the
heart, liver, lungs and brain.
Would You Like To Be Strong?
You can soon overcome the habit or vice
of smoking and eradicate every trace of the
poison from your blood by taking a course
of “ SMOKDRE” Tablets, the great French
specific and nicotine antidote.- This re-
markable remedy restores nerve and heart
strength, makes the brain and body vigor-

The Inky Way.
“ Hassan Three at once ! Help ! Mr. T. D. Mutch,
the first of my assailants, is at least courteous ; but he is
also inaccurate. Our Melbourne “Journalists’ Associa-
tion ”is a real union. There are several kinds of unions,
the representative sorts and the unrepresentative. These
are the big unions which cut ice, and the little unions
which cut none, but abuse the big unions because
they were “not consulted.” I do not want to
annoy Mr. Mutch—l hate annoying people. But
the little union of casual writers, trade-artists,
and juniors to which he belongs does not represent the
Sydney pressmen, and he knows it. When his deputa-
tion went to Mr. Beeby with a request for registration,
Mr. Beeby, not seeing any of the daily paper staff hands,
asked them where the reporters were; when they showed
him their reporters he would consider it. The Melbourne
Association has every reporter on each of the three dailies.
Mr. Mutch seems proud of the fact that his little
unrepresentative union has objected to the re-
gistration of our association. The whole truth
of it is the Sydney unrepresentative union has
a bad attack of State Fright fever. It was indeed a par-
ticularly dirty action. Nor will it help the formation of
a strong United Association of Australian Journalists.
The Sydney Union should have come in with the Mel-
bourne men if they have the idea of organisation at heart.
The only difference between the two Unions is this : the
Melbourne body has a good seasoning of sound men in it
who see that the mere fact of organisation will do more
for the underpaid members of the trade than wild
hurrahs for Unionism, and wild yells for the Arbitra-
tion Court. The Arbitration Court, at all events, has
no power to act yet. The first thing is to organise. The
States Fright won’t help that. Mr. Mutch says that the
“Registrar was not to be bluffed, and told his visitors”
(the A.J.A.) “ that he would consider the matter and let
them know in 30 days.” Doesn’t he know that the law
prescribes 30 days as the time during which damphools
like the A. W.A.U. can lodge asinine objections to their
own cause? The Melbourne men do not wish to pre-
vent the ill-paid men from the country and suburbs
from receiving better wages. But they do de-
sire that the thing shall be done quietly, without
bombshells and alarums and excursions and shrieks
of rage. In regard to “Clarence O'Hagan’s ” remarks,
a few words may be of value. “Clarence” com-
plains that he had to do £9 worth of work for £4 10s.
a week for three years on one of the Melbourne dailies.
Is he sure that the work was all right? It does
not advertise his capacity as a reporter if he stayed for
three years upon the staff without an increase of wage.-'.
Audi have frequently noticed that the men who growl most
about the work they have to do are not the men who do
either the best or the most work. There are two kindsof
workers. The first is fond of his work and takes a pride
in it, and doesn't continually grizzle when a harassed
ohief-of-staff marks him for what he considers more
than his share. The second "is the man who works
only because of the screw he gets, aird not with any
enthusiasm or pride in his job. That man is dear at
L’4 10s. a week in a newspaper office. I would also liß.e to
point out that I also hold that a “ Pressman’s Union will
do a lot of good if worked adequately.” The only trouble
is the exact interpretation of the word “ adequately.” Will
it be worked adequately by a lot of boys and has-beeils
and failures, or will it be worked adequately by the men
who have the interest of the trade at heart add
who do not let their “wrongs” run away with
their intelligence? Deny it if possible—the men of the
metropolitan dailies are a keener, more level-headed and
more experienced class than those of country papers
and the little suburban news-sheets and butter-wraps.
“ Arcadian ” is the third and least of the three who call
me to account. “Arcadian” has bad manhers, a bad
temper, and a bad disregard for the truth. I refuse to
argue with him. Ido not know who he is, and I don’t
want to. “I pass ‘ Hassan,’” he concludes, flamboyantly,
“ but I grasp the hand of four-fifths of the rest of the
Melbourne boys.” Well, I never asked him to grasp my
hand. I had rather he wouldn’t —his hand may be like
his method of argument, dirty. *
“The Arcadian” : T. D. Mutch (B. 26/l/’ll) is a rascal
for finding out things. He’ll be a terror wheh he grows
up. He discovers that “ Hassan ” has “ let the cat out of
the bag” regarding the formation of the Australian
Journalists’ Association. In the first place there wasn’t
any cat, and there isn’t any bag, and if there were,
“Hassan” hasn’t any knowledge of either, because what
he wrote was what he hoped, not what he learnt at the
launching of the A.J.A., for he w'as absent from thecere-
’ mony. T. D. Mutch didn’t know, and therefore might be
pardoned his boyish exultation in picking the misin-
formed “Hassan” to pieces. How much “Hassan”
didn’t know about the A.J.A. and its objects may be
judged bv the fact that the Akous proprietary is now
credited With the intention of attacking its regis-
tration. The big Collins-street paper producers are
on the same ground in this respect as the Aus-
tralian Writers and Artists’ Union, of which T.
I). Mutch is an office-bearer. What a spectacle !
The A.W. and A.U., “ the only genuine trades union of
journalists,” cheek by jowl w ith the anti-union Ahgus in
opposing the„A.J.A. ! No one objects to the sacrifice of
“Hassan.” Anyone who voluntarily joins a union and
utters such sentimentsas “ Hassan ” deserves much w orse,
than Mutch. Of course, T. D. Mutch’s object in writing
was to show what a fine body the AAV. and
A.U. is; but he lets the blowfly out of the
mealsafe when he confesses that they have been
formed since September 9, and have not yet
been able to get the necessary numbers to apply
for registration. Apparently they haven’t been rushed
by the working journalists. The fact that the A.J.A. had
no difficulty in this respect calls forth T. D. Mutch’s
“swelled head” remark, and leads him on to
other imaginings, such as the alleged frantic rush
to the Registrar to dump the rules down “in
full expectation that the official seal would be
at once affixed,” and the decision of the Registrar not to
be “bluffed,” and his “ wild expostulation ” in telling his
visitors that he would consider the matter and let them
know in 30 days. Now, there was no frantic rush, but a
mild and orderly procession of two individuals (of whom
T. D. Mutch w'as not t>ne), who knew what any other
pressman ought to know—that the law provides that
every application for registration must remain
open to objection for a period of 30 days after it is
notified in the Gazette. Neither was there any evi-
dence that the Registrar was or was not to be bluffed, or
of any expostulation (mild or otherwise) on his part.
T. D. Mutch protests too much—Too Damn Much. Sup-
press™ Veri claims him for its own when he gloats with
defective-like pride in the A.W. and A.U. having meantime
“got hold ” of a copy of the A.J.A. rules, and sent objec-
tionsbased on them tot.he Registrar. T. D. Mutch knows
that the A.J.A. sent his body several copies of its rules as
soon as it was formed. This is how it “ got hold ” of
them! Who says that dog doesn't cat dog? ,; r

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is a youth who dwells in gloom,
As in a dungeon’s inky tomb,
Ye Bulletin’s Rejection Room,
Whence fancy’s birds fly back ;
A silent youth, with cynic eyes,
Who reads the Editor’s replies
To correspondents, nor denies
The thumb-screw and the rack.
Undaunted at his woeful task,
He wears no torturer’s sable mask,
In dying groans he seems to bask ;
On picture, tale and pome
His office is to stick the stamp
On masterpieces, still half-damp
With ink or wash ; to town or camp
With joy to fare them home.
Respect he hath not for the great,
Nor artists high doth venerate ;
He only knows the poet’s fate
And smiles behind his sleeve.
Damned manuscripts and drawings blue
He bloweth back to me and you ;
Nor stavs to offer homage to
“ The Wasp ” or “ Bellerrive.”
The milk of human kindness not
Hath touched him on one tender spot.
To scorn the talent is his lot
To lay the mighty low.
What stone for heart hath he within
This Headsman of The Bulletin ?
Alas ! What hardened man of sin
This callous youth must grow !

fFOREST DEVIL.
HOW A LADY WORKED
THE “DEVIL.”
Messrs. J. COOPfeR & SONS,
Melbourne.
PANTON HILL,
17th October, 1910.
Dear Sirs,—Just a few lines to let you know how we are getting along with the Bunyip
Forest Devil father bought from you three weeks ago. Father says it is the BESI
MACHINE HE HAS EVER USED, and he has seen and used a good many, and is very
pleased with it.* I inuSt lhtyou know a little what we have done with it. Our trees are
mostly white gum, box, and messmate. We have uprooted trees that were 4ft. 6m. in
diameter, or so thick tjhat the anchor rope was just big enough to go round them, with only
father and myself'oii the lever. There was one giant that, when I said to pull it, hither
seemed very dohbtfid, and. told me to wait until my brothers came home from school; but I
said, Put the rpfies on ” ; arid both of us got on the lever, and, in a short time, out came the
monster with toots in the air, and made a hole not less than sft. deep and 12ft. wide. We
had not seen a trfee pulled like it. Father would not have the hole filled up, but lets it stop
there so people ciin see WHAT A POWERFUL MACHINE THE “BUNYIP” IS. I
have PULLED THEEIS MYSELF, about 2ft. in diameter, without any help. Some of our
trees are dead about five years, and the roots are mostly green, and bring up a great dot of
soil, but it is all the same. THE GREEN ONES COME OUT JUST AS EASY AS THE
DEAD ONES. There is NO STOPPING when once the “ Devil” catches hold of them—
THEY HAVE, TO COME WITH THE BUNYIP. Wishing you every success in the
future, yours truly,* (Signed) MARIA NOISCHALL.

A PHENOMENAL BREAK
836
NO more positive proof of the worthiness of an Aleock ” billiard table could
be given than by the splendid performance of George Gray, the young
Queensland player, in his match with Fred Lindrum, jun.
A Standard “Aleock” Billiard Table was used, and certified to by the
Amateur Billiard Association of Victoria (which is affiliated with the Billiard
Association of Great Britain and Ireland).
Gray, who made 830-831 coming off the red, and thus made two world’s
records—used Crystallite balls, and the marvellous accuracy with which they came
off the cushions, the ease with which the most difficult shots were accomplished,
speaks for itself of the merit and superiority of “ Aleock ” Billiard Tables.
Write for illustrated catalogue—it’s full of information.

Suffered Terrible Pain —Doctors s many Treatments
Useless —Restored to Complete Health by Bile Beans
h
Mrs. M. Murphy, photographed
after her cure by Bile Beans.
WRITING of the striking success
of Bile Beans in completely
curing her of terrible indi-
gestion and biliousness, Mrs. M.
Murphy, of 16 Andrews Street, Ade-
laide, S.A., says :—“ My life was made
a misery by fearful attacks of indiges-
tion and biliousness. The accumula-
tion of wind in the stomach caused
terrible pain under the heart, accom-
panied by awful pains between the
shoulders. I also suffered from dizziness
and violent headaches. When these
attacks were very severe I could not do
any work. I would be thoroughly pros-
trated for days together with awful
biliousness. Violent fits of vomiting
would strain me internally and cause great
soreness, making me very weak.
** An eminent doctor attended me with
no success. 1 then tried many remedies,
but ail the treatment I went under was of
no avail. Nothing seemed ableto cure me. Then I adopted the advice of
a friend and commenced taking Bile Beans. After a few doses I noticed a
remarkable difference in my condition. The dizziness and headaches
ceased, and I was able to eat in comfort. I resolved to continue with Bile
Beans, and after a full course I was completely restored to health, and have
never been troubled with any of my old complaints ever since. Now
I always keep Bile Beans as our family medicine, and would not be without them.”

A Birthday Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY years of youth are many now :
The total grows apace—
’Tis scored to-day upon my brow
And written on my face.
But still I laugh, and what’s the odds ?
My Withers are UnwrUng ;
I’ve done my best to please the gods,
And whom they love die young.
When luckless striplings chance to die,
Like buds on blighted stem,
Dull commentators oft apply
The proverb old to them,
As though long life were punishment
And death a favor flung
To boys and girls whose friends lament
The fact that they died young.
But Youth is no allotted span
Of years that quickly pass,
As stated by the preacher man ;
Nor is all flesh as grass.
And if a tough of twenty-three
From gallows beam is swung,
The gods are not supposed to be
His cause for dying young !
The deities enthroned above,
For centuries untold,
Confer the favor of their love
On such as grow not old.
Despite the years which come and go ;
And I am one among
The players in the passin g show
Predestined to die young.
Let others taste the joys of age,
That I’ve no mind to share ;
Some men are wanted on the stage,
With grave depressing air,
And “fair round belly, capon-lined,”
Who long to life have clung ;
Let me be to the grave consigned
When I’m no longer young.
The blissful dreams of verdant youth
I’m dreaming as of yore ;
I’d never learn life’s bitter truth
Though were my years fourscore ;
My heart lilts sweetest songs of glee,
Long banished from my tongue ;
The giddy gods are fond of me,
And whom they love die young.
VICTORIA.
EDMUND FISHER.
The Wiltons’ Governess.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GEORGE Wilton owned a big cattle
station with an unpronounceable native
name, which custom had reduced to simple
Dilly. Dilly was 250 miles from the nearest rail-
way station, and consisted of about 1000 square
miles. It grazed a good many cattle when the
seasons were good, none when they were bad. It
was said that there was as much bone as grass on
its surface. Yet George Wilton had prospered,
mainly because he lived the simple, corned-meat
life.
After a succession of good seasons ending some
20 years before, he had built himself a big stone
homestead beside an artesian well. The water
tasted of magnesia. It would not grow cabbages
and with difficulty allayed a thirst.
When the homestead was ready he married a
city girl with a taste for romance. She found
romance, the simple, corned-beef life and a han-
kering for society incompatible. So she died a
few months after the birth of her third child.
Wilton had a hazy idea that she had died from
some internal complaint—which was true. Most
complaints are internal.
His bank balance grew and so did his children
—a wild girl, and two wilder boys, who had learned
the ways of cattle and horses and knew the huge
run from end to end, but were deficient in most
other knowledge. Their deficiencies did not
strike him till a brother died in Melbourne,
leaving a nephew to be taken care of.
The nephew was a city boy, whose knowledge of
the bush was derived from small excursions to
shoot tom-tits. But he had been to college, and he
was 20 years of age when he was dropped by a
bullock waggon at the slip-panels of his uncle’s
homestead. With him were three big boxes, one of
which contained a library of impossible advent-
ure.
The brothers and sister stared at their neatly-
clad cousin with eyes like cattle, and Harry stared
at them with eyes like a rat’s. The mutual dis-
approval was plain.
“ Any shooting up this way ? ” asked Harry,
swinging a gun and displaying two revolvers.
“ Kangaroos and sometimes a duck or two when
it’s wet,” said Dick.
“Any horses to ride?” The brothers and
sister laughed loudly.
“ We never walk, none on us,” said Jim.
“Where did you goto school?” asked Harry,
feeling that he had blundered.
“School! What’s the good o’ school, when
yer’s wanted fer musterin’ ? ” said Milly.
“ It teaches you to talk correctly,” said Harry.
Whereupon Dick offered to fight him. scenting a
reflection on his grammar. Milly interfered.
“Wait till father comes in, Dick, an’ let him
see if you’ve got anythink ter fight about.” Milly
had some intuition. Her father decided that
they had. The battle was a drawn one, because
Dick was inclined to be friendly. Milly was
referee, and Jim supported each impartially.
“Wbat was it all about?” asked George at
dinner.
“ He said we didn’t talk right,” said Milly.
“Your grammar’s awful,” said Harry. “ Where
did you learn to speak ? ” A heavy silence fell
upon them all, most heavily on George Wilton.
It suddenly dawned on him that he had over-
looked the educational problem. He couldn’t
imagine how the thing had happened. Possibly
it came of leading the simple, corned-beef life.
A month later an advertisement appeared in a
Brisbane paper. “Defin'd conversation and de-
portment essential ” were the concluding Words.
A month later Dick and Jim were sent With the
buggy to bring back Miss Weggs.
* * * *
The Wiltons were expecting a long, attgtiiat
lady of uncertain age to improve their English
and deportment. Miss Weggs Was 19* a pretty
girl of gentle manners and a soft voice ; and her
bright blue eyes looked innocently upon a wotld
of conventions which she totally failed to under-
stand. But she believed that she knew all about
teaching, because in her little bag were certain
papers that said so. Of everything else, herself
included, she was delightfully ignorant. And she
firmly believed she was a lady.
When Dick and Jim met her at the township
they instantly became shy. She was pleased to
see that they were nice-looking, and she stepped
into the dusty buggy with eager interest. She
patronised them maternally, and was surprised at
their silence. She spoke about the birds, made
some original remarks about the beauty of the
plains, and, when the sun began to set, admired
the great glow of color and the long, golden
streamers that shot athwart the sky. To all of
which the boys answered nothing.
When the sun set they pulled up, and took out
and hobbled the horses. Then they pitched a
tent.
“What’s that for?” asked Miss Weggs. It
was the first direct question she had put.
“ For you to sleep in. We camps under a tree,”
said Dick.
“Sleep in ! Where’s the hotel ? ” They stared
blankly.
“ There ain’t no hotels,” said Jim.
“ How much further have we to drive ? ”
“Two hundred miles,” said Dick.
“ Have I to sleep in that—that thing—often ? ”
asked the girl of 19, a suspicious catch in her
voice.
“Three more nights,” answered Dick. “We
can’t travel fast with a lady an’ only four ’orses.”
Then Miss Weggs lifted up her voice and wept.
“ Oh, take me home,” she wailed.
“Don’t be frightened, Miss. One on us will
sleep in the tent if yer feels lonely.” The governess
gasped, which checked her tears.
The second night she slept under a tree,
wrapped in a blanket as they were, and felt more
secure than she had ever felt inside four walls.
By the third night she felt that they ought to
have the certificates that appeared so valuable to
her in the city, only they did not cover the kind
of knowledge that the boys imparted.
When she arrived she asked for Mrs. Wilton.
Her question told George that she was quite
ignorant of what he assumed all Australia knew.
Both had taken things for granted. Her extra-
ordinary ignorance alarmed him. She appeared
scarcely well-informed enough to instruct his
children. Milly looked at Miss Weggs as if she
were a calf of unknown brand. It was cousin
Harry who answered her question.
“My aunt died some years ago, Miss Weggs.
Didn’t Uncle George mention that he was a
widower?” Both the information and the
question were superfluous. But in Harry Miss
Weggs recognised something she knew. She
stepped on to the verandah.
“There has been some misunderstanding, for
which lam as much to blame as anybody. But
we can make the best of it, can’t we, sir ! ” she
said, turning to Mr. Wilton. She had learnt
something already from the boys.
“That’s the way to look at it. By the way,
what’s your Christian name?”
“ Madeline, sir,” she said, with dignity.
“That’s all right, Maddy. Call me George.
The kids often do.” Miss Weggs stared aghast.
But she realised that remonstrance would be
totally misapprehended. Wilton raised his voice
and bellowed : "Dick, you bull ! Jim, you calf !
Come here.” They came from the stable together.
“ Now listen to me, you kids, I’ve brought Maddy
here to teach you all how to speak, to behave at
table, to dress properly, and you are to obey her
as you would me, or I’ll brand the lot of you with
raw hide. Do you follow ? ” The lanky girl and
more lanky boys grinned. Harry laughed.
“Ain’t we ter teach ’er anythink, George?”
asked Dick.
“What the blazes do you think you could teach
her ? ”
“She don’t seem ter know much about bush
whackin’.”
“Maddy may not want to learn . that, eh
Maddy ? ”
“I think I would,” she said, blushing a little,
and avoiding the eyes of Dick and Jim.
“ I’ll teach yer ter ride,” drawled Milly. Her
eyes suddenly lighted up. “Oh, I say, them’s
pretty togs you’ve got on.”
Miss Weggs explained the difference between
“togs” and a frock, and asked to be shown her
room.
“ Oh, this will never do ! ” was her first remark
at the sight of her apartment. Milly’s face fell.
She had taken great pains in cleaning up. The
dust had been swept into one corner. In another
was a heap of saddlery. The grease-spotted
cover of the dressing-table had been reversed, but
that had not made the grease lumps less promi-
nent.
“ Have you no maids?” asked Miss Weggs.
“ Only the black gin,” said Milly.
‘‘ May I have her services for an hour or two ? ”
“ Right-o ! But what’s the matter ? ” said Milly.
“You may come and see when I have done.”
Then the three young men came in with her boxes.
“ I’ll change my clothes now,” she said. Harry
went out. Dick and Jim sat on the bed beside
Milly.
“I’ll change my clothes,” said Miss Weggs
again. The Wiltons looked at her with a growing
wonder. There was a strained silence, the strain
wholly on the part of Miss Weggs.
“ Why don’t yer begin?” asked Dick at last.
“ We’re waitin’ ter see what yer other togs is like.”
When the governess had finished her first lesson
on etiquette, Dick and Jim were looking dazed.
Nor did they know in the least what cousin Harry
laughed at when he saw them.
The severest shock of the lesson was to Milly.
For her to tumble out of her clothes in the pre-
sence of her brothers had seemed the most natural
thing in the world. Then she turned scarlet as
she suddenly remembered Harry’s look of aston-
ishment at her lack of —what ? She was begin-
ning to discover that she was a girl. There was
some bitterness in it.
* * * *
But Miss Weggs was learning too. Some
things she had learnt not to see at all. The
Wiltons looked squarely at everything, and their
directness was taking something out of Miss
Weggs which she was beginning to realise should
never have been there. But she had the acute-
ness to see that theirs was a clean view, and did
not betray the dismay she felt, and she never
laughed at them. Wherein she was different
from their cousin Harry.
Then she saw the other side. With their
daring frankness was a daring courage, and a
loyalty to simple things that she had never under-
stood. Milly was the same as her brothers. Miss

WHEN BRIGHT DAYS ARE DISMAL
Sunny days bring joy to well folks. But to the man or woman
with an aching back, every day is dark—just a dismal round of
suffering. Can’t work well, enjoy play, or even take restful
sleep. Always that dull, throbbing backache.
Have you thought that your kidneys may be disordered ? Sick
kidneys signal for help. The first call may be lameness or pain in
the back —-scanty, painful or too frequent urination —recurring
headaches or dizzy spells —nervousness, or a constant dead-tired
feeling.
Avert the serious kidney diseases —dropsy, gravel, diabetes,
Bright’s disease. Cure the weakened kidneys with Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, a remedy that strengthens weak kidneys, stirs
sluggish kidneys to action, soothes and heals inflamed, congested
kidneys. Backache is cured, and a perfect filtering of the blood is
restored.
Two Sydney Men Cured.
Mr. Henry Adams, 44 Edith Street, St. Peters,
Sydney, says:—“For quite a long time I have suffered
from pain in my back. I got little rest at night, and
would toss and turn for hours. Consequently in the
morning I felt tired and weary. I began using Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and two boxes made a difference
in my health, and a course of this remedy completely
banished the pain. They have proved a marvellous
medicine, for it is eighteen months since they cured me,
and I have never suffered with my back since.”
Mr. Frederick Bradd, 34 Pearl Street, Newtown,
Sydney, says:—“l caught a severe cold, which settled
in my kidneys, and caused severe backache. I suffered
intense pain, and could not stoop or move about freely.
I did not know what to do to get ease, for the remedies
I used did me no good. Seeing an advertisement for
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills led me to try these pills.
They did me good right from the first dose, and in a
short time I was cured. I have no sign of backache
now, and attribute my cure solely to Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills.”

Weggs wanted her to ride side-saddle. Milly
only laughed. Then Miss Weggs procured pat-
terns of a divided riding-skirt and made them up.
The result in the mirror appealed to the feminine
in Milly. After that a healthy interest in dress
took as large a part in her as her interest in horses,
and in many subtle ways Miss Weggs made Milly
feel that she was not a boy.
One day Mr. Wilton looked round the great
dining-room, and realised of a sudden that it was
quite different from what he remembered it six
short months before. Order, cleanliness, snowy
linen and polished cutlery had replaced disorder.
Then he noted that there was much more re-
straint in the manners of his children ; that their
clothes were brushed and their hands clean ; and
that when they spoke their English was
noticeably improved. At the other end of the
table was a bright-eyed girl, not yet 20, and as he
looked at her a puzzled frown gathered between
his brows. She reminded him dimly of a woman
he had utterly forgotten for 10 years. He rose
ivith a jerk that capsized his chair and a muttered
“Damn.”
The fierce summer had been and gone with its
wet monsoons, and the first of the south-westerly
winds was bringing its coolness over the grass-clad
plains, for another good season had come. The
young stock had all been branded, and Miss
Weggs had learned to ride —astride and un-
ashamed. Harry had tried to make her ashamed
of it, and failed.
In the comparatively idle time following the
mustering and branding, the Wiltons made a pic-
nic of their work, and took the governess with
them. Long days they spent on the plains, sleep-
ing where the night found them, and surrounded
by 15 or 20 horses. The spirit of the free life took
complete possession of the city girl. The only
discordant note was from Harry. He was longing
for the city again ; to Miss Weggs it had becomes
dream and nearly a nightmare. Her soul was
now bare of all that was unessential to her civili-
sation. The veneer of self-consciousness was gone
from her, and she felt like singing all day long.
Then she discovered that in teaching the Wilton
boys that they were men, and Milly that she was
a woman, she had taught them more than she
knew.
It was on the last night out on the plains. Miss
Weggs felt that the stars were saying subtle
things as they blinked in the vault of the night.
The blue flame from the fire appeared to flash
answers. The talk had gradually died away, and
they were all buried under the vast silence of the
night, when Harry edged himself closer to Miss
Weggs.
“Are you asleep, Madeline?” His tone startled
her attention.
“No,” she murmured, aloud and guardedly.
“Aren’t you tired of this stupid life? I feel
like a calf.”
“Tired ! ” she exclaimed. The thrill in her tone
dulled him.
“Come out of it,” he said. She was silent. “I
want you to come away with me ; to Brisbane,
and then to Melbourne. We live there. Here
we vegetate. These uncouth relations of mine
don’t know what living means.” Miss Weggs
thought she saw a slight quiver in Milly’s blanket
beside her. “They are little better than
savages.”
“Hush!” whispered the governess. “I won’t
listen to you.”
“You are not safe amongst them.” It was too
dark for Harry to see the surge of color in Miss
Weggs’s face.
“I’m as safe as —as I want to be,” she said, and
turned away from him. Harry sprang up as n
he had been bitten by a bull-ant. Like shadows,
one by one, Milly and her two brothers rose.
Miss Weggs got up slowly, shaking and trem-
bling. The blanket fell from Dick’s shoulders,
and stepping forward, he took his cousin by the
throat.
“Kill him, Dick !” hissed Milly, stamping her
foot. Miss Weggs buried her face in her hands,
and dropped on her knees. The two men rolled
over, and Dick rose astride Harry’s body, silently
and savagely throttling him. Milly was standing
over the struggling men, her teeth gritting, her
hands clenched, her knees bent as if ready to
spring on them.
“Dick, Dick, for my sake, don’t!” pleaded
Miss Weggs. He failed to hear her. It was
going hard with Harry, who had ceased to
struggle. His eyes were protruding, and his face
was darkening. With a hard sob Milly threw
herself on Dick.
“ Ycu brute ! ” she wailed. “ Leave him
alone!” and, dragging Dick away, she threw
herself beside Harry in a storm of weeping.
Dick rose slowly, and, with a hang-dog air,
stepped to Milly.
“ I’m sorry I heard him. I didn’t want to lose
my temper.” Madeline began to cry. “ Don’t
be frightened. “You know you are safe —from
me.” Jim went and put his arms round Milly.
The fire twitted, and a stick flickered into flame.
Dick turned away.
“ Dick, come back ! ” When he turned he saw
by the light from the fire that Miss Weggs’s edu-
cation was completed.
Milly only sobbed. Her education had just
begun.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN the good, old spring-time, when the
days are beginning to grow longer and
warmer, men make more often for the long-
beer patch, to gather the juicy sleever which
there abounds.
“O’ course,” shouted the smallish young man
in the corner of the compartment, “o’ course, it's
a great respollibility—’sponsibility—when you
begin to make your run. When you start to make
it—make it! ”
The large, fat youth in the opposite corner
nodded solemnly. They had each spent a couple
of hours in the patch, very evidently.
“That’s right, Charlie—star’ make run, make
it ! ” he agreed.
“Maybe furlong, maybe half-furlong—when
you start to take on shishponsibility o’ makin’ yo’
run, make it! Don’ let ’em shtop you ! Make
it! Home fellers start makin’ run. Too soop?
Star’ pullin’ head off the horse. Spoil the run.
Star’ too soon? Well, nev’ mind ! —once taken
espontibility o’ startin’ to make a run, stan’ up
an’ make it ! Don’t let ’em beatcher ! ”
“ Qui’ right, Charlie. Qui’ right. I rum-
member ”
The smallish young man sat up, and pulled his
hat down over his eyes, glancing sideways at the
rest of the company—strangers all. His face
seemed to strike a chord of memory in my mind—
so to speak. It was not a hard face, by any
means, and memory’s strings were not greatly
agitated. Had I seen him weighing out at Flem-
ington ? Or perhaps in the bird-cage ?
The smallish young man sat up, pulling his hat
forward, and went on talking to his pal, without
giving him an opportunity to take any but a
listening part in the conversation.
“Edward!” he warned him, in the most
friendly fashion, with one bunch of finger-tips
gently pointing the emphasis on the fat youth’s
knee; “Ted! You can say what you like, but
the fact remains that there’s on’y one way to ride
a winnin’ race—if you’re ridin’ a horse. O’
course, if you’re ridin’ a crock, it don t matter
much. Ride um any way you like, Ted. But if
you’re ridin’ a horseflesh, Ted, ride um .with a bit
o’ brains, an’, once you take on susponsibility o’
makin’ your run, sim’ly ride um right out ! See !
Ride um right out! ”
“ Right, Sharlie—ride um right out ! I ’mem-
ber” —
“On’y one way to do it!” shouted the smallish
young man. “ You kin ride a horse, Ted ? ”
Tom nodded, confidently, leaning forward with
eager interest. It would have been impossible to
say, from his manner, whether he knew that he
and his friend were not the only two travellers in
the compartment.
“ Well,” urged the other, generously, “ I can’t
give you any berrer advice ’n this : If you’re out
to win, don’ be bustled—don’ be bally well
bushtled. Keep your eye on the field ; judge your
run; an’, once you shtar’ to take reshpon’—star’
to make your respon’ibility o’ your run, all I say
is, make it! Make it, an’ if you’re goin’ win-
why, you’ll win. You’ll sim’ly go on an’ win.”
The fat youth exhaled heavily.
“Charlie, you’re ri\” he affirmed, stoutly.
“ Y’ know —I rum —member ”
The train drew up at Malvern. I had joined
it at Toorak, and it had been a short, interesting
trip. Still, although I had not yet received any
information which might prove of value to me—
such as the winner of the big race in the week
following—l had to leave the train.
The fat youth stopped at “I remember,” and
glanced carelessly over his shoulder at the rest of
us. Then he turned sluggishly to the smallish
talking-works.
“Going Caulfield ?” he asked.
“ O’ course,” answered the horse expert, and
the train rolled on.
The day before the big race I went to get some
money. Things were busy at the bank, and
Horse was in the air. I handed up my cheque to
the ledger keeper to be marked. A hand snatched
it. There was a pause. Then I heard my name
called, and a face peered down at me over the
mahogany. A smallish young man held my
cheque down to me with an anxious look in his
overworked eyes.
“D’ y’ know anything for to-morrow?” he
asked mildly, as though he had never rioted
through a beer-patch in his life.
FRANK HENTY.
For the Men of Old.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
EVERMORE pledge ve the men of old !
(Each man in his own right place.)
To the hearts of gold of the days of gold
To the sires of the Austral race.
There were fierce extremes in that mighty birth.
When the Austral race was born.
They came from the depths of Hell upon earth ;
They came from the hills of morn.
Their metal rung true nnto every test,
No better this world has seen ;
And ever ’tis best just to think of the best,
Honest, and brave, and clean.
When hand struck hand, in the days of old,
Heart unto heart was clenched ;
And never by God was a true tale told
How a mate at a mate’s need blenched.
Purposeful men, from the threshold out,
They were keen on their quest and work ;
Ugly to heckle, and bad to flout,
And ill for a fool to irk.
They set their backs to the sky and sea.
They breasted the mighty land,
Saying : “ Here shall the gate of the New World
be,
And here:shall our city stand.”
They fired no roof and they sacked no town,
Nor captive took, nor slave ;
But they ravelled the breasts of the mountains
down.
And they harried the gold king’s cave.
They built their towns where the forest fell,
And they chartered each and all—
Where the white man won let the white man
dwell;
But never a white man’s thrall.
Their scorn was bitter of cad and clown,
As their love of a man was strong,
And they clanked their gage in the world’s face
down
’Twixt womanhood and wrong.
Aye, it’s well to remember them, now and then,
As we follow their tracks’ bold blaze—
Those men who were fit to beget true men,
Those kings of the golden days.
In the riot and rapture of roaring sprees,
In the glory of good gold won.
Or in lone, last camps by the she-oak trees,
Man’s day (and a glad day) done !
While the magpie poured from his half-sane soul
A bubbling brook of song,
That broke in a sob to the bird-bell’s toll,
As the strange thing passed along.
Evermore pledge ye the men of old
(With whom be peace, pray all),
And send us to camp in the self-same fold
When we answer the bell-bird’s call.

Dread of Indigestion
drives many men and women to a mistaken dietary regime,
and—chronic dyspepsia. It is the greatest mistake in the world.
Anybody who knows the supreme corrective value of Cockle’s Pills
can enjoy all the rational pleasures of the table with impunity. Cockle’s
Pills thoroughly purify, regulate, and strengthen the digestive system.
They ensure natural functional activity. Physicians have recognised
this for the last century.
PI LLS.
Yob Know What To Expect
in certain circumstances. All doubt is eliminated. The result is a
fore-gone conclusion. To persons in doubtful health this must surely
be welcome news : and yet how many spend good time and money in
useless experiments! There is absolutely no excuse for this, because
in nearly every ease of ordinary ailments a cure can be easily effected.
When Yob Use
Beecham’s Pills you can safely predict the result. They have been
tried by so many people for so many causes, and in so many parts of
the world with such unvarying good results, that you know what to
expect. This can be said of very few medicines. It is surely consol-
ing when your food disagrees with you—or if you cannot sleep or you
are bilious and headachy—to know that all you require is a course of
Btcchatn’s pills.
This preparation ensures the healthy action of the
Stomach, Bowels, Liver, and Kidneys.

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use ; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache—a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite
independent of Aperient Medieines.
