BYRON’S HOME—NEWSTEAD ABBEY.
WHILE love of poetry and admiration of genius endure Byron’s place among the great songsters of the British race
is assured. He may not be so extensively read today as, say, half a century ago, but still his “votaries” abound in every
part of the English-speaking world. When the Corporation of the City of Nottingham acquired the ancestral home of
the poet, they performed an act of the highest civic merit. Not that Byron entertained particular affection for the seat.
This is evinced in his ode on leaving Newstead and his Elegy on the Abbey. He regarded it with a certain pride, however,
and in a letter to his mother in March, 1809, gave the assurance he would never sell it. Newstead has every claim to
be regarded with historical interest apart from its association with Byron. The priory of Newstead, or De Novo Loco in
Sherwood, was founded about 1170 by Henry II and dedicated to God and the Blessed Virgin. It was in the reign of
Henry VIII, on the dissolution of the monasteries, that, by a royal grant, it was added, with the lands adjoining, to the
other possessions of the Byron family. The favourite on whom they were conferred was the grand-nephew of the gallant
soldier who fought by the side of Richmond at Bosworth, and is distinguished from the other knight of the same Christian
name, in the family, by the title of “Sir John Byron the Little, with the great beard.” A portrait of this personage was one of
the few family pictures with which the walls of the Abbey, while in the possession of the poet, were decorated. It was shortly
after the murder of St. Thomas a’Becket on the steps of the high altar at Canterbury Cathedral that Henry II founded
Newstead. Newstead sustained a considerable siege in the war between Charles I and his Parliament.

DRAKE THE TIGER.
A. E. W. Mason is the writer who
with one unforgettable sentence put him-
self in the forefront of those detective
novelists who are something more than
dealers in bodies and puzzles: No^other
tiger passed that way that night. A
second tiger, burning bright, gives him
another dramatic phrase in The Life of
Francis Drake (Hodder and Stoughton ,
Angus and Robertson):
In Spain a dark lustre shone hencefoith
about his name. It emptied the seas as
the roar of a tiger empties a forest. tenor
ran before him. Silence was only broken
by the distant roll of his drum... .Burghley
might well write “Truly Sir Francis Drake
is a fearful man to the King of Spam.
The Life is an admirable piece of writ-
ing. The ringing phrases, Churchillian
in flavor and, like Churchill’s, intended
to hearten a nation at war (for a life of
Drake is, of course, a Message for Eng-
land), are put together by a genuine
craftsman —
A commission was on the point of sailing
for Flanders, there to arrange an armistice
as a preliminary to a treaty of peace with
Parma, who, for his part, bnly thought ot
peace as a silence brooding over the ashes
of England—
and they come rarely enough not to
make the book too much of a roar of
tigers. The style for the most part is
pleasantly ironic:
It [the Pacific Coast of America, 200 miles
north of San Francisco] was a country in-
habited by a friendly and tractable sort qt
heathen who mistook Drake and his
countrymen for gods. They were a people
more, inured to the making of long speeches
than the crew of the Golden Hind were to
cold. They made speeches from canoes
when he arrived, offering him little baskets
of tobacco and bunches of feathers, but
would accept no presents in return except a
hat. A long essay could be written on the
passion for a hat which burns in every
primitive breast....
The tribe came down in a body to the
seashore on the following day with more
baskets of tobacco and more bunches qt
feathers. The women came down with it
and, tearing their faces and their breasts
with their nails, they flung themselves on
their faces on the stony ground. Drake,
shocked by these heathen signs of worship,
read from his prayer-book and led the smg-
ina of the psalms appointed for the day.
This afforded them great pleasure.
Mason’s biography would need to be
well written, for it’s an immensely long
book. Its point as a Message for today
is the defeat of the Armada and the
shattering of Philip’s hopes for the in-
vasion of England, but Mason has made
a work of art of it, as well as a work of
patriotism. The whole Elizabethan scene
is painted in, in all its richness, for back-
ground ; and against the passion and
squalor and comedy and vigor of the
age the portrait of Drake, not always a
“hero” in the Boy Scout sense of the
term, but always a man, stands out mag-
nificently.
It is anecdote always, rather than mere
statement or historical analysis, that
makes a man or a period come to life ;
and Mason’s book is crammed with
anecdote. The whole spirit of the Eliza-
bethan age —the adventurousness, the
earthy unscrupulousness, the humor, the
strange mixture of religion, patriotism
and buccaneering—is caught in the anec-
dote of Drake’s chaplain. Parson Flet-
cher, prospecting in South America:
They found a Spaniard lying asleep on
the ground, and, by the side of him, 13
bars of silver which were worth 4000
Spanish ducats, or, in our money of today,
£l4OO. They had no wish to wake the
man from his nap, Fletcher relates, but
against his will they did, and “seeing that
we had done him that injury we freed him
of his charge, which otherwise would per-
haps have kept him waking, and so left
him to take out (if it pleased him) the
other part of his sleep in more security."
It was Parson Fletcher’s lucky day. The
party met a second Spaniard, this time a
boy who was driving eight llamas each
carrying two leather bags, and each bag
carrying 50 pounds or so of refined silver.
“We could not endure to see a gentleman
Spaniard turned carrier so, and therefore
without entreaty we offered our service and
became drovers. Only his directions were
not so perfect that we could keep the way
he intended; for almost as soon as he was
parted from us we with our new kind of
carriages were come unto our boats.”
Most of Drake’s character —his venge-
fulness, his impatience of criticism, his
rough good humor qnd the qualities of
leadership that made him the beloved
master of his sailors —comes out in
Mason’s second irresistible anecdote
about Parson Fletcher—the story of his
“excommunication.” Somewhere be-
tween Celebes and Java on the way back
to England on the voyage round the
world (how close Drake came to Aus-
tralia!) the Golden Hind ran on a reef,
and Parson Fletcher, by way of helping
her off again, preached a sermon. He had
held a long grudge against Drake for
his execution of Thomas Doughty at
Port Saint Julian, and must have made
some reference to the incident (probably
he preached that the ship’s peril was a
Divine judgment on Drake). Drake was
too busy that day to attend to the parson,
but he had time now, and on the very
next morning his protest took the shape or
an excommunication.
It was the oddest form of an excommuni-
cation that was ever known. First he had
a staple knocked into the hatches in the
forecastle, and Fletcher made fast to it
by a chain and a fetter round his leg. Then
the crew was mustered and Drake, sitting
cross-legged on a chest with a pair of
pantouffles on his hands, pronounced the
sentence i —•
“Francis Fletcher, I do here excommuni-
cate thee out of the Church of God and
from all the benefits and graces thereof,
and I do denounce thee to the devil and all
his angels.”
Next he forbade him to come ever betore
the mast under pain of hanging if he dis-
obeyed. Finally he had a “posy” bound
about Fletcher’s arm, with this description
of him written upon it, “Francis Fletcher,
the falsest knave that liveth.” And if he
took that off, he would be hanged.
Drake and the parson had figured
together in a strange scene earlier when
Doughty, for intrigue amounting to
mutiny, was beheaded in the sombre bay
where there was still standing the fir
gallows on which Magellan had hanged
a mutineer.
Kneeling side by side, Francis Drake and
Thomas Doughty, accuser and accused,
judge and condemned prisoner, received
the Floly Sacrament from the hands of
Francis Fletcher, the chaplain, with rever-
ence and contrition. One may picture them
both with the tears running down their
bearded faces, for the men of those days
were hardly more reticent of those tokens
of emotion than children are today.
Dealing with this incident, as with other
unfortunate moments in Drake’s career
(Hawkins’s allegation that Drake “for-
sooke us in our great miserie” after the
battle of St. John de Ulua ; his humiliat-
ing arrest of Vice-Admiral Borough
after Cadiz; and the frequent charges
of arrogance), Mason adopts the sensible
attitude that Drake’s faults, weighed
against his courage, his generosity, his
care for his men and his colossal ser-
vices to England, are of little import-
ance. “No company of people lacks
some jealous ones eager to bring a great
man down to their own level by setting
a gloss upon his actions; the trial and
death of Thomas Doughty have come to
such a notoriety that if Mr. Pelman
says ‘Drake,’ you say ’Doughty.’ ”
A child of four living on a disused
hulk, listening to the tide lapping against
the planks against which his cot was
wedged; commanding, at 22, his own
50-ton ship Judith, slave-trading with
John Hawkins ; leader of an expedition
of two ships at 24, off to the West Indies
to harry the Spaniards ; raiding Nombre
Dios; the first Englishman to see the
Pacific when he climbed a ridge near
Vera Cruz, waiting to attack the Panama
treasure-train of mules; back to Eng-
land with only 40 of his 73 men, but with
wealth for those who did return, “the
English flag unstained by any charge of
cruelty, and a reputation which to the
end of time was to stand high in the
book of fame”; back to the Spanish
main, settling with Doughty, sacking
every one of his officers and then rein-
stating them, to demonstrate his authority
and to quell, by his personal courage, all
plans or even wishes for mutiny ; setting
free a negro—“Since thou wishest to
go, thou canst go with God’s blessing,
for I do not wish to take anyone with
me against his will” ; rowing by night
in hostile Callao harbor, cutting the
cables of the Spanish ships; loading on
to the Golden Hind gold worth £2,500,000
of our money, silks, porcelain, jewels,
flour, sugar and salt pork—loot from
the great treasure ship Nuestra Senora
de la Concepcion ; back to England, after
the hazardous voyage round the world,
with five million pounds’ worth of gold ;
intrigue and enmity at home ; the treach-
eries of Philip, Elizabeth shrinking from
open war ; to sea again, acceptance of
a ransom of £37,000 for Cartagena ; back
to England, the execution of Mary
Queen of Scots ; the “incomparable ex-
pedition” to Cadiz to strike first at the
Armada ; then the familiar story of the
game of bowls on Plymouth Hoe (Mason
accepts this as probably true, but says
'that Drake would have had to wait for
the tide to turn before he could attack
the Spanish, so he had to fill in the time
one way or another—he wasn’t being
careless or overconfident bv going on
with his game); and then, as the climax to
this great and turbulent career, the defeat
of the Armada: by English seamanship,
Mason declares, not by the winds.
Some of this is familiar stuff, but it is
made fresh by Mason’s masterly descrip-
tions of the great sea battles. A piece of
history that’s probably not so familiar,
since interest in the Spanish threat usually
dies out once the Armada is done with:
Suddenly [in 1599, 11 years after the de-
feat of the Armada] four Spanish galleons
with 600 sailors aboard, which had been
planning a raid on the Channel Islands,
missed their way and landed at Mousehole
in Cornwall. Mo one expected them;
no one opposed them. They burned up
Mousehole, Newlyn and Penzance, and
celebrated Mass upon a hill behind the
town. Then, hearing that Drake was still
with his ships in Plymouth, and that the
wind was blowing from the north, they
got back into their ships and scuttled away.
Mason is able to write so well of the
long naval war because he is (or was
in the last war) a naval man himself. He
recalls that he and other naval officers,
visiting Cadiz in 1915, were puzzled by
the Governor’s coldness towards them:
In the end he was asked with the due
courtesies, why. The Governor received
the question with profound astonishment
that anything so inevitable should not have
been understood; and he exclaimed with
an incredulity which his good manners
could not quite conceal, “Have you for-
gotten Drake?”
That is as good a summing-up as any-
one could make on Drake the “tiger,”
Drake the great fighter for England. As
for Drake the man, Drake the adven-
turer, there’s an enduring picture of him
stretching himself in lonely triumph over
a'rock on an island south of Cape Horn:
He told Sir Richard Hawkins upon his .
return that he had gone ashore carrying a
compass with him to make sure of the thing
he was about. He sought out with the help
of the compass the “most southernmost
part of the island, cast hiipself down upon
the uttermost point of it, grovelling, and so
reached out his body over it.” When he
had returned on board, he told the whole
company “that he had been upon the
southernmost known land in the world and
even further to the southward upon it than
any of them, yea, or any man as yet
known.”
Ajax and the Frogs,
“Where are you going for your week-
end outing? To a swamp? Splendid!”
Take along a bottle or two. Afterwards
they can hold specimens, of which
there should be abundant examples on
view, especially if Ajax is there, defying
the frogs-spit and other terrors, and
ready to help Homo ignoramus to see
what there is to be seen.
This isn’t the first Ajax nor the Aus-
tralian god of the same name, but the
nom-de-swamp (and elsewhere) of a
Westralian lady, a brainy one—Ada Jack-
son, M.Sc., daughter of Perth barrister
H. B. Jackson, K.C., and author of
Seashore, Swamp and Bush (Robertson
and Mullens). The author is brought into
the clinic by Professor Dakin, of Sydney
University, who, before handing her over,
gets off his chest one or two annihilating
wisecracks aimed at aspects of Australian
education:
This is not a textbook of biology. If
it were I should not be writing a foreword.
Australian education has been almost
wrecked on the worship of textbooks,
syllabuses and examinations.
And some more;
School Science—and that has meant the
only science for most people —has in many
cases been a travesty of the real thing. It
has been school chemistry or school physics
or botany adapted not for real life but
for examinations.
The author takes up the running
with chapters of curious nature lore.
As an example, the Portuguese raan-
o’-war the blue air-sausage creature
that brings profanity from stung
surfers —isn’t merely one being: he’s a
whole army. The blue sack isn’t the
animal, but a float for carrying on its
voyaging the extensive community at-
tached to it and to each other, some
catching and killing the food —their taste
runs to flying-fish and cuttlefish—others
with the gourmet’s-paradise job of doing
the eating for the whole community but
passing on to the rest a fair cut of the
nourishment, and the whole of them
working together on Utopian lines, with
a fair division of labor, and no strikes.
On the score of such lore —-ranging
from frogs and snails to sea-squirts and
grass-trees —the author is one of the live-
liest specimens brought into the clinic
for a considerable time.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
Stefan, the performing seal, was sick of
the glare of the footlights, sick of the
blank white faces staring at him night
after night. Pausing a moment while
balancing a glass of whisky on the end
of his nose, he snuffed the air. Ah! Borne
upon the night wind, faint but unmistak-
able amid the fragrance of humanity and
the perfume of King’s Cross ham-and-
beef shops, came the odor of the sea to
his nostrils. There was rain in the air,
and he thought of the great tide clutch-
ing at the seaweed on the rocks, like the
passionate lovers of Russia dragging their
women by the hair.
“Ungh! Ungh! Ungh!” he cried.
“Ungh ! Ungh ! Ungh !”
He reared upon his tail flippers. Sleek
and yet bristly, his head was high above
the front row. The audience was for-
gotten. The sea was calling him, and he
was calling to the sea, wild and wet to
wild and wet, primitive to primitive.
“Ungh! Ungh! Uffte! Ungh!
Ungh /” —the deep barking cough of the
bull seal.
Then he heard it. Low and miraculous
through the rainy night. He could not
believe it. The ferries had tricked him
before with their sonorous whistles.
Many of the keepers of the ham-and-
beef shops, when pained or excited, could
make such noises. Bristling, he listened.
Yes; it was! “Ungh! Ungh! Ungh!”
Softly, gently, maddeningly, the cry of a
female seal answering his passion.
He fell upon all four flippers. He
bounced upon the boards in a fury of
agony and delight. “Uffle!” he snorted.
“Ungh !” he sobbed. She was in the Zoo,
was she? Well, he would see about that!
Theatre, traffic, shoppers, N.E.S. wardens,
King’s Cross lovelies —he brushed them
aside as a maddened bull elephant
hurtles through the undergrowth in the
jungle. Within two minutes he was into
the harbor at Potts Point. He swam out
into the darkness. A shark got him. He
died.
That was the end of Stefan, and this,
is the end of this picture of the passion-
ate Russian waiter in the .third act of
Noel Coward’s “Point Valaine” at Syd-
ney Minerva.
Apart from the extraordinary resem-
blance, in make-up, antics and vocabu-
lary, of Arundel Nixon’s waiter to a
performing seal, “Point Valaine” is not
very interesting. For all his overacting,
Nixon gives it its only moment of life.
That it has none of the gusto that made
“The Man Who Came to Dinner” such
a success is due partly to the fact that
Edwin Styles is missing, but chiefly to
Coward’s tawdry plot and pallid writing.
A middle-aged woman who keeps a
hotel has an affair with her head waiter ,
a romantic young aviator comes to stay,
has an affair with her, learns about
Stefan and is disillusioned: thats all
there is to the plot. It is padded out with
some satire of the other guests which,
though mildly amusing, confuses the
action, is without a single memorable
piece of wit and is familiar stuff from
Coward. Marie Burke, Hal Thompson,
Harvey Adams, Richard Parry and the
rest do their best with it, but its a pity,
on the whole, that it’s not about the love
life of a performing seal.

A joint show by portraitist Norman
Carter and sculptor Andrew Meszaros at
the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney, in-
cludes a medallion of Carter by Mes-
zaros and a chalk sketch of Meszaros
by Carter. Both gentlemen are accom-
plished technicians in their respective
spheres, and Mr. Carter has the valu-
able gift of being able to perceive beauty
in (and educe it from) almost any sort
of countenance.
One of the most comprehensive call-
ups of Norman Lindsay’s nymphs,
gnomes and satyrs Melbourne has seen
is at the Sedon Galleries. It includes
most of the artist’s best-known etchings,
and when last seen the red spots were
spreading on them rapidly. A pleasant
atmosphere of peace surrounds the oxhi-
bition. At earlier, Lindsay shows, the
hair and feathers used to fly and elderly
dowagers wanted the artist s head
brought in on a platter. The dowageis
now look at the same pictures without
blinking an eyelid, because Lindsay has
become accepted ; yet his world of wild
rhapsodical humor and impish noncon-
formity is still the antithesis of the world
the dowagers stand for. Their world
is trampled over by tanks and over-
shadowed by aerial navies; few wound
deny that Lindsay’s is pleasanter. To
the dowager’s charge that it was immoral
he might retort: “What, then, do you cal
moral, madam*'?”

OUT OF THE
PAST
The Pawky Scot.
J.H.M. ABBOTT.
' ‘ I CANNOT believe it, sir,” said Cap-
I tain William Blake, Adjutant of
I H.M. 46th Regiment of Foot, as
he talked in the orderly room with
his commanding officer, Lieut.-Col.
George Molle. “ Tis incredible — fan-
tastic.”
“Well, my dear Blake,” replied the
Colonel, “there it is. You see the in-
structions I’ve received, in General Mac-
quarie’s own handwriting. There can
be no mistake about them. His Excel-
lency, you are as well aware as I am, is
Commander of the Forces, both military
and naval”—it was characteristic of
George Molle to reverse the usual order
of precedence in referring to the two ser-
vices—“and can do as he likes with us.
He is responsible to no one but the Sec-
retary of State for War. He’s quite at
liberty to move the regiment to any part
of the colony he chooses ; and, although
such an order as this may well provoke
subsequent inquiry—questions in the
House of Commons even —and result in
his censure by the Secretary of State and
possibly his Excellency’s recall by the
Colonial Office, there’s no question what-
ever as to the necessity of its being obeyed
immediately and without hesitation on
our part. Oh, damme, not a possible
doubt of it! That’s the situation, my
dear Blake.
Colonel Molle leaned back in the
wooden elbow-chair in which he sat
before the plain barrack-table whereon
was transacted most of the regimental
business of the 46th, and handed the
Governor’s letter to the Adjutant, stand-
ing at one end of it with anxiety and
concern writ large in his homely, side-
whiskered features —very closely-clipped
whiskers down to the angle of the jaw,
as was the military vogue of the day.
“Read it aloud, if you please, Captain
Blake. I want to assure myself that it’s
real by hearing it enunciated aloud. Even
yet it seems a little like a bad dream
to me. Read it out, if you don’t mind.”
TEARING his throat nervously,
v '-' Captain Blake held the paper up to
the light and read it to his commanding
officer, as desired:
“Sir, —In my Capacity as Com-
mander of the Forces garrisoning
His Majesty's Territory of New
South Wales, I hereby Order and
Direct you to proceed with the
Headquarters companies of the
Corps under your Command to the
Left bank of the Hawkesbury River,
and there to take up a position
opposite to Richmond Hill, com-
manding the entrance to the defile
of the River Grose. You will there
so dispose the Forces under your
Command as to be in a position to
oppose any invasion of this Terri-
tory by the tribes of Black Abo-
rigines inhabiting the Blue Moun-
tains. These orders are to be
executed with the least possible delay.
“I have the Honor to be. Sir,
“Your obedient Servant,
“L. Macquarie,
“Gov’r.”
“Great heavens, sir!” exclaimed the
Adjutant as he handed the letter back to
Colonel Molle, “what on earth does it
mean? Does his Excellency suppose the
colony to be in danger of a raid by
those few wretched nomadic natives who
eke out a precarious existence in the
ranges beyond the Hawkesbury? Those
poor creatures! As well to fear an
attack upon Sydney by the kangaroos
inhabiting the scrub betwixt here and
George’s River. I confess, sir, with all
due respect to his Excellency, that I
really am of the opinion General Mac-
quarie stands in need of the attentions of
Dr. Redfern. ’Tis a case of overwork,
I think, sir. His Excellency’s energies
are too much for him. He burns the
candle at both ends —with this deplorable
result. ‘To oppose any invasion of this
Territory !’ Ha, ha! Twould be laugh-
able if ’twere not so troublesome and
vexatious. To move the regiment forty
or fifty miles into the wilds on such a
wild-goose chase as this! Sir, as I’ve
said, ’tis nothing but fantastic.”
“It may be, Mr. Adjutant,” replied
Colonel Molle, with a gloomy shake of
his head, “but it has to be obeyed. You
and I know the temper of General Mac-
quarie. If he were to order us to pro-
ceed to Cape York, dr to quarter the
regiment on Goat Island in the harbor
here, we’d have to do it. So will we have
to march out to the Hawkesbury in com-
pliance with this extraordinary command.
There’s no help for it. You’d better
begin to make arrangements with the
Quartermaster, and also see to the draw-
ing of tents and other camp necessaries
from the Stores. You’ll have plenty to
do in the next few days. By God, so
shall we all!”
Captain Blake looked doubtfully at his
commanding officer, as though he feared
to express in words what was in his mind.
The Colonel realised as much.
“Well, Mr. Adjutant? You have some
suggestion to make?”
“Nothing very helpful, I fear, sir. But
doesn’t it seem to you that such an extra-
ordinary letter as this may lay itself open
to misunderstanding? That ’tis not so
clear as you’d like it to be? In short, sir,
that there might be some loophole for
escape in your not appearing to be quite
able to grasp its meaning? A question
or two about it to his Excellency, sir?
Something might develop. ’Twould be
worth trying, I think, sir. Indeed, so
far as I can see, something of the sort’s
our only hope.”
“You mean that I should seek an inter-
view with the Governor, Captain Blake?
Is that it?”
“Yes, sir—that’s what I had in mind.”
Colonel Molle stood up, slapping the
letter with his hand as he rose to his feet.
“Yes, by Gad, Blake, I’ll do it. I thank
you for the wise suggestion. I’ll beard
the lion in his den. ’Tis, as you say, our
only hope and resource.”
C“'OLONEL MOLLE’S progress from
'-"'the Barracks in George-street across
the valley of the Tank Stream, mounted
upon his black charger Nimrod and fol-
lowed at a respectful distance by the
mounted orderly who was his official per-
quisite as Lieutenant-Governor, was no-
thing short of magnificent. The Barracks
guard turned out on his departure, and
the Governor’s guard on his arrival at
Government House on the opposite hill-
side, while in between those points several
sentries presented arms to him. It wa?
an Occasion in Sydney when his Honor
the Lieutenant-Governor paid an official
call upon his Excellency the Governor.
Macquarie, seeing his wife into her place
in the vice-regal carriage-and-pair as she
was setting forth to take the air, saw him
coming from the front of Government
House, and remarked to his lady drily;
“Ah, my dear, our pompous friend
Molle! 1 think I’ll be able to show him
that we Scots can sometimes indulge a
sense of humor. Yes —I think so. I
think so.”
“Lachlan, darling, you must tell me all
about it,” she laughed as she drove away
—“everything !”
“Ah, my dear Colonel,” said Mac-
quarie as his visitor dismounted, “I’m
delighted to see you. And, pray, to what
good fortune do I owe this pleasure?
Won’t you come inside? A glass of
sherry, perhaps? No. Well, come into
my office, if you please.”
He led Colonel Molle down a
passage to the room in which he trans-
acted business Mr. Secretary Campbell
thus described the interview afterwards
to his friend Mr. Pilkington, of the Com-
missariat Department, The door between
his Excellency’s office and his own was
ajar, he explained, and he couldn’t help
hearing.
“‘Weel, then, Colonel,’ says Mac-
quarie, ‘so ye dinna understand plain
English? Will that be it?’
“‘Nae, nae, sir,’ says Geordie Molle,
as stiff as yon poker, ‘your orders are
quite unambeeguous—quite. I realise
that. But, after all, sir,* he says, floun-

But, sir, says Molle, ‘think o’ the

“ ‘Colonel,’ says Macquarie, ‘yon’s my

Colonel, how the other day when I sug-
gested sending those three young officers
of the 46th who were mixed up in yon
disgraceful riot at Jordan’s cockpit, down
by Cockle Bay, across to Port Dalrymple
in Van Diemen’s Land, by way of pun-
ishment, ye reminded me of your respon-

MYRA MORRIS.
"A VERY BRAVE SHIP"
[This remarkable piece of descriptive writing was not intended for publication.
It is an extract from a letter by an A.I.F. man to a friend in Sydney.]
At Sea.
Maybe this will be read. Maybe it
won’t. You see, it is being written in the
hold of an ex-sugarcane freighter as she
battles her way back to Australia —and
comparative safety.
I remember that back home on various
occasions, looking at parades and visits
of certain visiting navymen in ridiculous
little pork-pie caps, one had a rather
tolerant demeanor —maybe a slightly
supercilious type of condescension about
those blokes. They were all right in their
way, naturally, but couldn’t possibly hold
a candle to “us Britishers.” They were
just learners, of course. But now ...
Remember what happened to the
Prince of Wales and Repulse? They were
(if memory serves aright) attacked and
sunk by 54 Japanese bombers.
Yesterday I stood on the deck of our
old sugar freighter and watched the
approaching formation of nine Jap
bombing ’planes—long in wing, slender
in fuselage, and in color a dull silver.
Things of beauty really. But then some-
one called “Tjiere’s more of the .”
And again in another direction we dis-
covered more and still more. The count
finally disclosed 36.
I summed up the position. Fifty-four
sank the pride of the British Navy, Here
were 36 of them attacking us —a convoy
of but a few troopships, escorted by an
aged destroyer, two sloops and one
cruiser (call her “X”), manned by those
“learners” in the ridiculous pork-pie caps.
And no support from the air whatever.
Our chance of survival? Well, even a
bookie on the Randwick flat would let
you write your ticket on that bet.
(The freighter rolls in the swell. An-
other change in course.)
On the previous day our ship had sur-
vived the attack of a lone bomber. But
now... I heard an officer say “We’re
sure gone this time.” No doubt about
it. I walked up to my old friend Charlie.
“So long, Chas., old boy; it’s been
jolly nice knowing you.”
“Sure, Mac,” he said. “It won’t be
long now.”
We extended limp, lifelesslike hands, in
the fishy, unenthusiastic salute of the
dying gladiator.
But “X” and the two sloops were hard
at it with their “flak.” There was the
flash of guns, the sharp, hard, angry
note of the explosion, then away up —
high in the air—would be seen a greyish
or black woolly-looking ball gradually
unfolding itself. There were dozens of
those woolly balls expanding up there.
But the ’planes were above them and
continued on their indifferent way. Then
it was clear what their tactics would be.
Destroy that cruiser and the convoy was
at their mercy.
They split into flights for the attack.
Over they flew —high—but dropping their
bombs —“straddling” her with those 250-
and 300-pounders. She was flat out and
very fast —35 knots —over 40 miles an
hour, her bows throwing up clouds of
spray and spume, the white, foaming
frothiness of her propellers at her
stern. Covered in her own smoke,
huge spouts of water from those
crashing bombs twisting, turning,
propping and doubling back in her
tracks. God, what seamanship, and
always through that screen of noise and
water and smoke could be seen the angry,
defiant flash of those ack-acks, telling
those above, “Keep high, you merciless
swine! Keep high!”
They drew off. They went after one
of our sloops—a sweet, dainty little ship.
(I remember viewing her launching.) She
was fighting, fighting hard. Then up
came “X” —something sublime in her
courage, her audacity, her magnificent
efficiency. Again she fought them off.
They split up into groups of nine, and
made for the troopships. Half of our
unit are aboard another freighter, and
she was the first to be attacked. They
let her have it. Down came the bombs,
and she reeled so violently that I swore
she’d capsize. But then, high above
came nine bombers in perfect alignment.
“Take cover!” “Lie flat inside!”
“Mouths open!”—all kinds of cautions
shouted by officers and sergeants. We
were zigzagging violently. X dashed into
a passageway and fell flat. As I reached
the floor there was a short, sharp, terri-
fying whistle, then a dirty, horrible
yellow flash and a thunderous, hellish
explosion which lifted men everywhere.
Half-stunned, I raised my head to see
a clearing pall of white, filmy smoke.
Instantly there was a shout of warning.
Down came a lot of tossed-up debris,
and I felt a blow —not a hard one —on
my tin hat. I began feeling myself.
Dead? I don’t think so. Hurt? Don’t
know —think I’m O.K. Oh, yes, I’m
all right. Whacko, I’m still in it!
But what was it that hit me? I looked
around and found it. Believe you me
or believe you me not, I ’ad been ’it on
the ’ead with a loaf of bread!
Well, we collected our casualties.
“Sarge, there’s blood on your shirt.” But
it proved to be the blood from the chap
next to me, who had a nasty shrapnel
leg wound. A young chap standing just
above our heads was lying with his arm
blown off. A sailor near by was killed.
So it went on.
They drew off later—bomb racks
empty. “X” came along and took up
her place in the convoy. We proceeded
on our course —undamaged. The bombs
had fallen on both sides of us, but had
just missed the ship.
Later came the news “Singapore has
fallen.” Very shortly there was a change
of course. The convoy swung around
and...
(Do you notice the writing more wobbly
than its usual wobble? A bit “bomb-
happy,” I guess. But the ship is rolling
in a choppy cross sea ; it’s hellish hot
right here.)
This is just my little tribute to a band
of very brave fighting men and a very
brave ship. Maybe in history it will be
just an “incident.” Of course, books
won’t record its glamor, like, say, Gren-
ville and the Revenge. Nothing of that
type, of course, was it? Or was it?
I always considered that song “God
Bless America” a bit banal. With the
greatest reverence, with grateful humility
and even with a feeling of pride, I will
always drink to the toast “God bless
U.S. May she live long!”

AUSTRALIA AND AMERICA.
In Melbourne last week Mr. Curtin was
delivered of another admirable pledge,
this time in the presence of General
Blarney, though it was meant also for
General MacArthur. He said that, as
far as the actual conduct of the war in
Australia was concerned, neither the
Commonwealth Government nor the
Commonwealth Parliament would inter-
fere in its military direction.
Military matters are for military men,
and neither the Government nor the Par-
liament will override their decisions.
He went on to praise General Blarney's
“qualities of leadership,” demonstrated by
his appointment as Deputy Commander
in Chief of the British forces in the
Middle East.
Mr. Curtin mentioned also that a War
Council was about to be set up at Wash-
ington, “as well as in London,” and in
a later statement he gave an account of
“the prolonged efforts” his Government
had made to “secure the creation of
machinery for the higher direction of the
war, which would provide an opportu-
nity for consultation with those whose
fortunes are involved. The final goal,” he
said, “has been reached in three stages”:
(1) by Australian representation in the
British War Cabinet; (2) by the setting
up of a War Council in London, “though
the Commonwealth Government would
have preferred that it should have been
in Washington” ; (3) “by the establish-
ment of a War Council in Washington.”
In each case the Australian Govern-
ment had been “given full recognition.”
The war in the Pacific would “have its
proper place when grand strategy was
being decided, and Australia would have
a proper voice in the making of those
decisions.” He might have said truly
that his Government’s main object was
to remove the direction of the war from
the hands of Mr. Churchill, but without
any diplomatic training he has been an
apt learner of the language of diplomacy.
Indeed, he hardly ever says a foolish
thing.
The War Council at Washington has
had its first meeting, and Dr. Evatt has
testified that its proceedings were satis-
factory ; but, with the London Council,
such as it is, still in being, it would be
idle to pretend that the Washington im-
provisation has effected much of a change
for the better. Mr. Roosevelt’s prelimi-
nary references were noticeably lacking
in enthusiasm. Canada’s part in it looks
rather perfunctory. Canada is repre-
sented on a board which decides where
the United Nations’ war supplies are to
be sent. Australia and Maoriland are not.
Australia is indebted to Mr. Roosevelt
for his chivalrous championship of this
country in dark days. It is only fair to
him to recognise that he has to consider
not only the necessities of this country and
Maoriland but public opinion in his own
country and that of the Latin American
Republics, as well as the counsels of his
military advisers. It would be embarrass-
ing to him if representation on the War
Council at Washington were claimed by
all the Latin American Republics with
a Pacific coastline, and he has to recog-
nise the fact that a great many Americans
consider Germany the chief enemy and
the war in the Australian territories, even
if it should extend to the mainland, a
sideshow. Dr. Evatt, stressing the
“urgency of the need for complete and
speedy reinforcements for Australia,” has
come up against this problem. Friendly
as it is to Australia, the New York
“Times” has published an article, said
to have been inspired by “certain service
strategists,” in which its chief military
critic. Major Hanson Baldwin, declared
that “Australia, except to Australians,
is not strategically vital to the cause of the
United Nations ; it is an outpost, and one
that could be lost without losing the war.
Even in the strategy of the Pacific Aus-
tralia and New Zealand do not play
principal roles.” And the chairman of
the Senate’s Military Affairs Committee
has demanded the recall of General Mac-
Arthur for a conference with the War
Council at Washington.
In American eyes the Australian Gov-
ernment may seem to have been a bit
fc>° importunate, and rather ungenerous
m the affair of Mr - Casey. It will have
to show that it is prepared to support
p era i M a^ Arthur .to the Emit,” as the
Prime Minister promised and that it will
not allow political firebrands or trade-
union workstoppers to stand in the way.
Australia is no sealed book to the
Americans. Long before the war they had
investigators in the Commonwealth study-
• n7Ar L; nfY c • a
in S tne working Ot US methods of Indus-
trial arbitration and the history of its
conscription referendums and the results.
And it may be taken for granted that
p„ nor .] ° u .. «•
General MacArthur has about him
shrewd men ot affairs who know more
than most Australians do about the extent
to which the power of the central Gov-
ernment has been weakened by years of
surrender to the arrogance of Red trade-
union leaders and the demands of pro-
vincial Governments, and the fact that,
with the mines far better equipped and
the need for coal far grea ter than it ever
was before since petrol is a vanishing
commo dity, the N. S. Wales output was
only a trifle more in 1940 than in m 5

a war to decide wh ich group of million-
ab-e exploiters is to dominate the world.”
This Sydney Town Hall meeting, as the
American observers would doubtless have
noticedj was a “Russia first” show, de-
signed to support the pretence that Aus-
tralia deman ds a Second Front in Europe,
for which the b i oo dy affair of St. Nazaire

A report G f tbe Sydney Town Hall
meeting was published on the day that
£ be suppression of the “Australia First”
movement and tbe internment of 20
alleged principals were announced in
p a rli a ment. Eleven days after the an-
nouncement was made no evidence sup-
pQrting the startling accusations had been
pub ii s hed, nor had the public been pre-
wisely informed whether the accused
persons or any 0 f them would be brought
trial. Our American friends, while
do ubtless unwilling to believe that the
action taken could poss i b i y have been
influenced by Communists, may have
observed t hat the suppression and
tbe internments were demanded by
Communists, and that Communists
carry on a n active waterfront propa-
in por ts with which they
b ave become familiar and in which a
spec i a j commission has been set up “to
e^sure the d loading and unloading
of shi « And while Mr. Ward, the
Minister for Labor and National Service,
- s not a Communist, though he seems
tQ be a bero to tbe brotherhood, some
Q £ bis remar k s and proceedings must have
interested them.
j n ma k e -up and manners Mr. Ward,
as a politician, recalls the Sydney larrikin
of the c i d colonial school. Born in a
ruder age> be m j g ht have disputed the
leadership of the Rocks push with
“Griffo,” whom some of our Americans
w m re member. He has publicly gloried
£ n tbe f ac t that he did not serve in the
i ast war . Before he became a Minister
Q f tbe Crown he introduced a bill de-
signed to prevent men called up for home
service being obliged to fight beyond the
limits of the continent and Tasmania,
and with the connivance of a weak Gov-
ernment he succeeded in having conscien-
tious objectors who might be Commu-
nists, conscientious objection being valid
even if “not of a religious character,”
freed from the obligation to render mih-
tary service.
Mr. Ward hates wage-payers, banks
and “toffs” of all descriptions. In 1939,
when the Menzies Government proposed
to take a national register, he venom-
ously opposed the bill on the ground
that it was the forerunner of conscrip-
tion, and many of his noisy admirers re-
sisted the law to the point of publicly
burning forms. In the fullness of time
Mr. Ward had to introduce a national
register on his own account, and a large
section of the public, perhaps remember-
ing his previous attitude and the per-
formances of his noisy admirers, has
treated the obligation and the threats of
penalties for non-performance with con-
tempt.
As Minister responsible for the man-
power regulations, Mr. Ward placed
State Government employees (about
300,000, less those who have enlisted),
mostly organised in powerful trade-unions,
on the reserved-occupations list “in
Priority 2.” And although private em-
ployers are now forbidden to engage “a
male person” without a permit from the
National Service office. State Govern-
ments may without its interference en-
gage as much labor as they please. And
at Castlemaine (Vic.) last week Mr. Ward,
in an agreeable revelation of the sort of
mind he brings to bear on man-power
problems, explained how he had got
home on the banks. The sober Mel-
bourne “Age” reported his remarks in
the third person:
Private banks had been on the reserved-
occupations list, but he was of the opinion
that there was no need for private banks in
war-time. He had withdrawn their reser-
vation and had declared the Commonwealth
Bank a reserved occupation.... Labor must
demand a new order based on absolute con-
trol of production and ownership and social
justice for all.
The New Order is, of course, to be con-
trolled by Wards.
Yes, the Curtin Government will need
to be very careful of American opinion.
It would do well to study American
trade-union opinion, which is such that
the two great organisations, A.F.L. and
C. 1.0., offered no resistance when the
Roosevelt Government ordered soldiers
to occupy munitions factories in which
strikers were performing—and that was
before war broke out in the Pacific —
and last week transmitted to General
MacArthur specific assurances of their
support “to the limit.” Mr. Curtin’s best
way of ensuring American support “to
the limit” would be to dismiss Mr. Ward
and cease to parley with workstoppers,
whether louts, hoodlums or Communists,
adding disfranchisement for five years to
the penalties with which he has threat-
ened these “enemies of this country” (his
own expression), but has in no case
enforced.
"Thanks for the Scrap Iron!"
It is alleged and widely believed, two
being born every minute, that a frag-
ment of a Japanese shell dropped at
Rabaul (or it may have been Lae or
Moresby) bore the legend, scratched with
a nail (or written in chalk or indelible
pencil), “Thank you, Mr. Menzies, for
the scrap iron.” And thoughts (or what
pass for such) have gone back to “the
heroic stand” of the Port Kembla wharf-
laborers’ union, which refused, for a time,
to load scrap iron for Japan, and of which
Isaac Isaacs wrote that its “sturdy but
peaceful and altogether disinterested atti-
tude will find a place in our history
beside the Eureka Stockade stand against
executive dictatorship and an attack on
Australian democracy.”
The eminent Isaacs was not acquainted
with Port Kembla or its wharfies’ union.
People who are knew the “heroic stand”
for what it was —a nasty Communist
stunt; an attempt to embroil the Aus-
tralian Government with Japan at a time
when Australia would have been hard put
to it to fight Siam. It was followed by
proceedings inspired from the same
quarter and in no way “heroic”: a boy-
cott of the national register, with public
burning of forms (not, of course, Mr.
Ward’s; bushels of them have been
ignored); sullen campaigns against con-
scription and the A.1.F., and for
upwards of 12 months —denunciations of
“the imperialist war.”
It is not on record that the “peaceful and
altogether disinterested” wharfies’ union
came out against any of these stunts or
that it has denounced any of the ugly coal
strikes which have occurred very close to
Port Kembla since the Japanese came into
the war. Neither have this union nor the
Reds who worked up the strike against
the loading of scrap iron been noticeable
in demanding a Second Front in Siberia,
600 miles from Japan, though there are
vociferous Red demands for a Second
Front in Europe; demands which have in-
creased, if anything, since the grim warn-
ing of St. Nazaire. A Second Front in
Europe, with no friendly ports available,
no local piloting through minefields, no
wharf labor or machinery (perhaps the
idea is that the soldiers can swim ashore
with all the tanks, guns and supplies),
with the Royal Navy strained to the limit
after perhaps the worst four months in
its history, and with every merchant
ship that can be pressed into ser-
vice employed in other operations and
losses and damage accumulating danger-
ously! And, of course, with the Second
Front agitators, great mouth- and pen-
fighters, missing to a Pink clergyman and
a man!
Australian exports of scrap iron and
steel to Japan were comparatively small.
They amounted only to 49,210 tons in
1935, 47,424 tons in 1936, 66,795 tons in
1937, 46,268 tons in 1938 and 71,756 tons
in 1939, the last year for which records
are available: in six years 281,453 tons,
valued at £968,380 Australian. In the
same six years exports of wool to Japan
were valued at £38,634,500. If the scrap
iron and steel was used for military pur-
poses (it can be used for many other
purposes), so was part of the wool. The
sturdy but peaceful and altogether dis-
interested wharfies’ union never jibbed at
loading wool.
An American in the scrap iron and
steel trade has been telling a committee
of the House of Representatives how
much scrap Japan got from his coun-
try. He reckons pre-war imports at
10,000,000 tons, “probably sufficient to
keep all Japanese plants at peak produc-
tion for a full year.” The quantity lifted
in 1938 was 1,381,000 tons and in 1939
2,026,000 tons —more than seven times
the Australian total for six years. In
1939, moreover, the U.S.A. exported to
Japan $56,000,000 worth of raw cotton
and $45,000,000 worth of petroleum pro-
ducts —also, of course, usable for mili-
tary purposes. This trade went on with
the full knowledge and consent of Presi-
dent Roosevelt. His object was to keep
Japan out of the war by supporting the
peace party against the war party, and
in this he was successful until the policy
was changed ; that is to say, until the
U.S.A. and the British Commonwealth
froze Japanese trade and assets in retalia-
tion for the move into Indo-China. After
that, the militarists took control.
Why didn’t the Japs enter the war at
the same time as Italy? Their army and
navy must have been as strong then, and
their air force nearly as strong, as they
have proved to be since December 7,
1941, and we can now see how much
truth there was in the story that they
had been fought to a standstill in China.
They had nothing to fear from Russia in
the summer and autumn of 1940, and the
U.S.A. was not then a belligerent, nor
was it prepared for war against Japan or
any other Power, Its measure of assist-
ance to hard-pressed Britain was small,
and it could have spared nothing for
Australia or Maoriland.
The only feasible explanation is that
Japanese abstention was an effect of the
policy which strengthened the hands of
the moderates and left the militarists
without a popular war-cry. Considered
in this light, the refusal to load the small
quantities of scrap consigned at Port
Kembla was an act of madness which,
if the Menzies Government had sur-
rendered to it, might have wrecked Mr.
Roosevelt’s efforts to keep the Japs out
of the war and led to their coming in at
the worst possible time for the Empire.
The Mookerjee Convention.
Apart from other blessings, Britain has
given all who desire it in India a free
and fluent English education with such
openheartedness that it has produced
large quantities of Indian babus, who
are indistinguishable from British babus,
as witness the conferences which for the
last week have been discussing Indian
“freedom.” ... „
On the British side is Sir Stafford
Cripps. He is a sprig of the English
peerage, a product of a great English
public school, a “barrishtar-at-lah,” the
same as Kipling’s Hurree Chunder
Mookerjee, and he has a nice line of
“Leftist” patter. Reporters the world
over are convinced that he “brought
Russia into the war,” though actually
Hitler did it. Babu Cripps has made
£30,000 a year at the Bar. A “famous”
correspondent has referred to him as the
Messiah of the New Order.” He is a
vegetarian.
The leader on the other side is Mr.
laharwal Nehru. He is a member of the
bluest Indian aristocracy—a Kashmiri
Brahmin. He is a product of a public
school —Harrow —and professes to love
socialism, like Sir Stafford Cripps. A
blindfolded man who listened to speeches
by Sir Stafford Cripps and Mr. Nehru
could not tell which was which, either
from accent or matter. A “famous cor-
respondent wrote that “India regards
Nehru as little short of a god.” He is
a vegetarian.
Arrayed with Mr. Nehru is Mr.
Gandhi. Mr. Gandhi speaks the same
sort of English as Messrs. Cripps and
Nehru. He is somewhat at a disadvan-
tage against Mr. Cripps in that his legal
practice was worth only £20,000 a year
at its height, and Mr. Cripps has it all
over him in the fact of being a pure
vegetarian while Mr. Gandhi stoops to
goat’s milk. Mr. Gandhi has, however,
evened up by swearing a vow of per-
petual chastity—he did it when he was


in his fifties, having married at 13. A
“famous” correspondent has likened him
to the French revolutionary who was dis-
covered in a deserted street shouting:
“Where is the mob? lam their leader!
I must catch up with them!”
Sir Stafford Cripps has offered his
fellow-lawyers Dominion status directly
after the war (seemingly with power to
sever relations with the existing Dominions)
and a Constitution-drafting committee,
representing all interests, to formulate the
plan. Unluckily, the Cripps scheme has
had to take into consideration the fact
that Indians outside the Nehrus and
Gandhis are apt to regard “freedom” as
freedom for 250,000,000 Hindus to
wallop 80,000,000 Mohammedans and
enslave the “depressed classes” and lord
it over the 6,000,000 Sikhs. The Sikhs
are resentful —to put it mildly—largely
because the almost complete Indianisa-
tion of the civil service has resulted in
their being governed by beardless persons
whom hitherto they had regarded merely
as human bladders to be pricked.. The
Mohammedans are vocal through a Mr.
Jinnah. Like the other gentlemen, he is
a barrister-at-law, was educated in
England and is full of non-co-operation,
though on other grounds. He wants a
Mohammedan State.
Sir Stafford Cripps had to tag on to
his offer a proviso that States which don’t
want to be free in the Nehru way may
elect to be free in their own way. The
Nehru party rejects the whole scheme be-
cause it says that this is turning liberty
into license. In any case it will not con-
sider being free unless it is given instant
control of Indian defence. Neither the
British Government nor the Indian
minorities nor yet the rulers of the Native
States are enamored of the idea of being
defended under the supervision of a party
whose secretary was recently discovered
trying to smuggle out of gaol the detailed
plans of a revolutionary plot. Neither
do they favor Mr. Gandhis defence
policy—“non-resistance based on the
example of the prophet Daniel.”
The “depressed classes,” whose barrister-
at-law representative is merely a graduate
in economics of Columbia (U.S.), has told
Sir Stafford Cripps that his scheme, if
implemented, “will do the greatest harm
to the 50,000,000 members of the de-
pressed classes, which would be placed
under an unmitigated system of Hindu
rule.”
It seems that Indian freedom is where
it was in August when Mr. Amery said it
was a question of not “whether Britain
would grant it, but how.”
Meanwhile, about 390,000,000 Indians
will continue to live their normal lives
and rush the recruiting offices, which
have been almost wrecked by the spate
of volunteers in the last few months —
humble people who would not know a
barrister-at-law if they saw one.
The Rajahs of the Native States have
said nothing. On the outbreak of war
many of them offered Britain their private
armies—Hyderabad troops fought in
Malaya. Some sent cheques. One, when
he heard that the Royal Oak was sunk,
sent thousands of pounds by cable for the
dependants of dead sailors. Another
bought a squadron of Spitfires. These
princes in the main appreciate that
British rule can give India greater free-
dom than could a partisan society which
has wrecked the national and seven pro-
vincial Parliaments as part of its “war
effort.”
They know that, if John Bull were the
tyrant he is supposed to be, he would
long ago have collared the Native States
and made a clean sweep of the “bar-
rishtars-at-lah.”
PLAIN ENGLISH
The Income-tax Swindle.
No layman can be sure how the confused
mass of Australian income taxes applies
in particular cases until the many oracles
have issued their decisions, but the posi-
tion as regards men of the fighting ser-
vices seems clear.
“Residents” of Australia have for many
years been taxed on income from abroad,
and American service men are or will be
“residents” within the meaning of a litter
of Acts. And though a promise has
been given that they will not be taxed,
it will seemingly need to be implemented
by legislative amendments.
As for the Australian fighting men
recently returned, their liability to State
and Commonwealth income taxes began
from the moment they set foot on Aus-
tralian soil, though a promise has been
given that it will be shifted to some
future date. Here again legislative altera-
tions will be required. The general posi-
tion is stated by John M. White, the
able president of the N.S.W. Taxpayers’
Association, in a brochure (“Taxation of
Military Forces”) he has issued:
All service pay earned in respect of ser-
vice outside Australia is exempt from Com-
monwealth income tax.... Generally ser-
vice pay earned in Australia is subject to
Commonwealth tax, and the pay of home-
service units is taxable in N. S. Wales, Vic-
toria, Queensland, South Australia, West-
ralia and Tasmania.
For many years The Bulletin stood
alone in advocacy of one intelligible and
equitable income tax for Australia. Now,
with veterans of Bardia, Tobruk, Greece,
Crete and Syria taxable as soon as they
reach their native shores, and with citi-
zens taxed 225. and 235. in the £l, the
so-called “system” has become such a
public outrage that there are none but
State Premiers and their satellites to do
it reverence. However these superfluities
rage, it will have to be scrapped forth-
with. The saving in administrative costs
alone would enable the one Government
that matters to make a 50 p.c. cut in tax
on service men’s pay.
Two Millions for A.R.P.
The glibness with which a politician can
throw off a phrase about £1,000,000
(what’s a million?) and the belief in some
quarters that gold doesn’t matter any
more doesn’t alter the fact that a
£1,000,000 is a lot of money. Aware of
this, and aware also of their shocking
State taxation, few N.S.W. taxpayers will
be satisfied with Premier McKell’s airy
announcement that “about £1,000,000 has
been made available for N.E.S. require-
ments” and the “Government still faces
a very heavy additional expenditure of
about £1,000,000.”
“Many of the undertakings for which
these funds were provided have already
been completed,” Mr, McKell went on,
and he named a few: Controlled light-
ing, £184,900; fire-brigade equipment,
£28,000; reserve drugs, £50,000; equip-
ment for rescue and demolition, £4000;
training of A.R.P. personnel, £2OOO.
That leaves £731,000 of the first
£1,000,000 unaccounted for. There
has, of course, been a flood of printed
stuff issued to wardens’ posts and
the public-most of it either unnecessary
or promptly superseded by subsequent
feirmc fho/o lo
N.E.S. Minister Heffron’s announcement
that the public is to get 1,000,000 gas-
masks and that wardens wil be required
to go round measuring faces to fit them,
but the mystery remains.
■ r , . , ,
Preparation of emergency hospitals and
r- . K ....
for compensation to owners of buildings
taken over are spoken of by Mr. McKell,
and there is the matter of money spent
. ... XT j L. ,
m places like Newcastle and Port
Kembla. But something more definite is
required as to how the money is being
spent, especially as the taxpayers know
from bitter experience how State authori-
ties can lash it about and especially as
Mr. McKell must be thinking of the next
Premiers’ Conference and the need to
justify his argument—if he has one —
against uniform taxation. Besides, he
has to do something with the wages-tax
money he is still collecting under the
guise of income tax. And if this Premier’s
explanation of the fate of £2,000,000 is a
sample of what might be expected from
the other Premiers, it is time the Com-
monwealth, which has its own Ministry
of Home Security and should be the sole
authority for A.R.P., looked into the
matter.
Synthetic Hate.
Trying to defend “The Jap as he really
is” broadcasts. Senator Ashley adopted
the old familiar device of side-stepping
the issue, which is that the departmental
broadcasts were childish in conception,
low in quality and apt to produce an
effect entirely different from the effect
aimed at.
Charles Bean’s objection to them was
the soldier’s objection. As official historian
of the Old A.1.F., Bean has, as he says,
“studied the Australian soldier for 27
years” and “there is nothing he so hates
and despises as this sort of ‘skite.’ ” That is
equally true of the New A.I.F. and of the
Australian in general.
Sample of the language used:
The Japanese hate us with a vile, savage
hatred, but we do not hate them. We find
them too loathsome for hate. We shall
never stop till we have cleared such loath-
some, creeping creatures from the face of
the earth.
That sort of stuff is familiar. Australians
know that it is imported, though not
from any English-speaking country.
They have their own psychology and their
own language, and they do not require
instruction from departmental hate-
mongers as to their feelings about their
Asiatic enemy who threatens them with
invasion and who has 20,000 or more of
their fellow-countrymen in his power.
“Does anyone suggest,” asked the
Minister for Information, “that the
Japanese should be depicted as nice,
genteel people to be received with open
arms?” None of the critics suggested
anything like it. The protest was against
the language and style of the broadcasts,
which have been repeated in silly adver-
tisements in the daily press.
CONTINUOUS ULTIMATUM.
“For the nine-and-ninetieth time, are you going to force me to cut it?"


No More
Coughing or
Sleepless Nights
BUCKLEY’S CANADIOL Mixture cer-
tainly makes short work of these stub-
born old hang-on coughs and colds, that
no other cough remedy will budge,
according to Mr. H. A. Allen. Mr. Allen
says: “For years I suffered every winter
with a terrible cough. I have had many
sleepless nights and coughed until tears
ran, and my stomach ached. I started
again with the same old cough this year
—but after a few doses of BUCKLEY’S
CANADIOL Mixture my cough was gone.
You can’t go wrong on Buckley’s—by
far the largest-selling cough medicine
in all of blizzardly cold Canada. One
or two doses ends a stubborn cough
and even the toughest old hang-on
coughs leave for good in a day or two.

POLITICAL POINTS
The Bulletin is informed that one of
the 20 “Australia First” persons now
under detention and lying in the shadow
of dreadful charges is an Old Digger wno
served four years, was wounded twice
and gassed twice, promoted from the
ranks and decorated with the Croix de
Guerre, with palms. And “he has always
been a passionate supporter of the White
Australia policy.” Obviously a case in
which justice should move with all pos-
sible speed. In the affair of an English
Quaker, “detained under Regulation
18B,” a habeas corpus application led to
its being proved that the Home Office had
made a serious blunder and the man was
released.
According to Fadden, the accusations
against the “Australia First” people are
“without parallel in Australian or British
history since the plot of Guy Fawkes.”
The good Artie obviously needs a re-
fresher course in history. He might
tackle the Cato-street conspiracy for a
start; the character of Thistlewood
would interest him. It was Thistlewood
who said “May God —if there is a God—
have mercy on my soul —if I have a
soul!”
Somehow every concession granted to
N.S.W. coalminers leads to strikes. A
rash of them broke out after Badly began
paying pensions to old hands at 60, their
“mates” objecting to their continuing to
work until the date (February 21) pre-
scribed by law. And the Drake-Brock-
man award of the 40-hour week to sur-
face hands, with overtime at time and a
half and double pay for holidays, which
was to have “eliminated friction” (union
secretary), was followed a few days later
by a strike of surface hands at a South
Coast pit. On the third day of the stop-
page, it occurred to someone to mention
that the strikers were “defying the ulti-
matum issued by the Federal Cabinet,”
It is not quite clear how many N.S.W.
coalmine strikes there were last Thurs-
day when the pits were closed for four
days, but Monday brought a threat that
3500 miners would be out unless Curtin
did something or other. Wage-payers
and -earners in other industries were
ordered by the Government to work on
Monday or take severe consequences, but
the privileged caste which mines a vital
fuel when workstoppers permit was
allowed to take the day off, having made
it obvious that it intended taking the day
off anyhow. It was on January 9 that
Canberra issued National Security Regs,
aimed at workstoppers; one was to admit
of their being fined any amount and
imprisoned for any period “or both.”
The Dunstan C.P. Government has
broken all Victorian duration records by
celebrating its seventh birthday. Since
its accession to office it has suffered only
three Ministerial changes ; Tweedledum
was displaced by Tweedledee and that
person by Tweedlediddle. It was some-
thing like that, anyhow.
The McKell Government talks of in-
troducing a compulsory third-party-risk
insurance bill for motorists when the
Sydney Parliament meets today. To judge
by outlying roads at Easter, there may
soon be no motorists to compel, the
dreadful N.S.W. motor registration fees
having driven far more off the roads
than the petrol rationing.
“No striking miner,” says a Canberra
writer, “can now be ignorant that he
runs the risk of being snatched away
.... to compulsory service for the period
of the war.” And from the N.S.W.
South Coast went telegrams to Curtin,
James and—of course—Ward, that 3500
miners may come out. Apparently some
“striking miners” are ignorant of the
alleged risk.
N.S.W. Railway Department made an
inglorious showing over the restricted
holidays. It first announced heavily cur-
tailed train services; then it sold tickets
to all-comers, with the result that trains
were packed like sardine tins and hun-
dreds left behind—to line up hours after-
wards for refunds. The department is
lucky that no accident occurred to any
of its overloaded trains. There is sup-
posed to be a Commonwealth transport
control body somewhere about. Nothing
was heard from it, though it has full
powers over State railways departments.
If Churchill and Cripps have their way
India is to become a Dominion “asso-
ciated with the United Kingdom and the
other Dominions,” and with “power to
decide its relationship with other member
States of the British Commonwealth.”
And if the Dominion of India demands
the removal of immigration barriers
“Glad to see you, Dig. Of course you know you’re liable for State and Federal
income taxes right away, but we, the seven Governments, ’ll see what we can
do for you."
raised by “other member States,” what
then? Churchill and Cripps do not ex-
plain and it is one of the thousand
points which never occurred to Austra-
lian newspaper and radio oracles who
were so passionate for war.
“A Pacific War Council has been es-
tablished at Washington, and Dr. Evatt
attended its first meeting.” That’s how
the news was conveyed to the Australian
public, and it gave so much satisfaction
as to leave no room for carping at the
choice of terms. But an intelligent
foreigner might despairingly ask how
there can be such a thing as a Pacific
War Council.
One part of Curtin’s account, pub-
lished on March 31, of what happened
at Darwin on February 19 might have
been better expressed.
It is definite that the number killed did
not exceed 240. That figure may be re-
duced when some more waterside workers
communicate with the Railways Commis-
sioner or the shipping agents who employed
them.
It may have conveyed a baseless impres-
sion that the waterside workers were still
running.
With Clapp as chairman, a Common-
wealth board has been formed to control
rail and road transport in Australia.
There are to be a Director of Road
Transport and a Director of Rail
Transport and, outcropping from them,
a War Railway Committee and a
War Road Committee. By the time
committees have been formed for
the different gauges and each high-
way gets its committee, with committees
for control of wheat or wool or coal
haulage and committees to control pas-
senger and livestock loadings and road
committees for droving and so on, the
thing ought to be as good as any other
board.
Another charge against Fostars, the
army boot contractors, has been dis-
missed, and presumably the last has now
been heard of these cases. After a hear-
ing which lasted 35 days, a Sydney S.M.
was satisfied that the controllers of the
concern “had no knowledge of the manu-
facture, existence or use of any false
stamp or false impression,” had “bought
good-quality leather for their military
contracts at market prices and, at times,
slightly above market prices,” and had
“procured no financial benefit from the
alleged use of a false stamp, nor had the
Crown proved that the impressions on
three soles produced in the case were not
made by the genuine stamp.” The de-
cision could be read with profit by poli-
ticians and newspapermen with a marked
tendency to condemn before guilt is
proved.
In an otherwise excellent paragraph
from Brisbane’s “Courier-Mail” three
words are redundant:
The retention of sovereign rights by any
State depends upon the defeat of an enemy
who is already bombing our shores. More
and more revenue must be diverted to that
purpose. The Commonwealth must raise
and spend it through the States.
The three words can be spotted by any
taxpayer who has received his State
income-tax assessment.
A N.S.W. farmers’ organisation is to
ask Mr. Curtin to “take steps to estab-
lish a national organisation for the co-
ordination and planning of rural produc-
tion and distribution.” But aren’t there
an Australian Agricultural Council, a
Department of Commerce, six State mar-
keting authorities, as many State war
co-ordination bodies and a herd of boards
for milk, wheat, meat, apples, pears,
tomatoes, potatoes, chicory, peanuts,
onions, scunions and bunions? What
on earth are they all doing?
A stranger reading the Sydney news-
papers’ version of the tea-rationing would
have been justified in believing that the
nation’s morale had been torpedoed.
Actually, all that has happened is that
some people will have to drink less of the
stuff. If they have nothing worse to
endure before this war is finished they’ll
be lucky.
Last December the Commonwealth
exempted from income tax the allowances
received by dependants of fighting men.
Then it waited for the States to follow
the lead, a vain proceeding. Now the
Commonwealth’s War Cabinet has de-
cided to “ask” the States to grant the
exemption. “Ask”!
Heffron, Sydney’s N.E.S. Minister, said
the other day that he’d likely be dis-
tributing 1,000,000 gas-masks to civilians,
and A.R.P. wardens may be called upon
to go round measuring faces to make
sure of correct fitting. They should be
instructed to allow a bit in length for
those who have yet to pay their State
income tax.
Fate has played a nasty trick on Ward,
who delights in being nasty to people
not of his political color. Like all his
colleagues, Ward bitterly opposed the
national register introduced by Menzies
and boycotted by the Communists (with
mass-burning of forms), denouncing it
as a prelude to the introduction of con-
scription. Yelping against the measure
on June 9, 1939, he said “If a person
does not fill in his form accurately in the
first place, how is he to be compelled to
do it afterwards? Is he to be bullied into
doing so ? ” Ward now has to put the con-
undrum, vastly extended, to himself. It
fell to his lot as Minister to issue national
register cards on his own account, and 2
great mass of people, notwithstanding
threats of horrible penalties, have failed
to weigh in with them.
Being a chemist, McGirr, Minister for
Local Government (no other State has
one), is alleged to be crammed with milk-
trade lore, so he may be named chairman
of the new board at £2OOO a year. Mean-
while McKnell announces a Sydney price
reduction, “date to be fixed in April.”
The “reduction” is 2d. a gallon. In
January McKnell’s Government added
4d. a gallon to the previous price, even
then the highest in Australia.
Employers were ordered to keep their
shops and works open on Easter Monday
and employees were ordered to go to
work. Therefore it ceased to be a holi-
day, except for coalminers —they, of
course, made it one. Nevertheless, the
Government ordered employers to pay
holiday rates —in some cases triple time
■—for working on the day that wasn’t, by
Government decree, a holiday. In
America the two great Labor organisa-
tions have agreed to forgo double pay
for holiday work.
In January the “famous” John Gordon
wrote that “Hitler’s armies in Russia are
about to be completely destroyed ; Hitler
is on the edge of the greatest military
disaster in world history.” Now the
“famous” person, still held up as an
authority to Australians, is bawling hys-
terically for a Second Front in Europe,
not to apply the finishing touches to “the
greatest military disaster in world his-
tory,” but to relieve the strain on Russia.
Melbourne “Argus,” which has lost its
old sobriety, hailed this conceited noodle
as “the greatest journalistic discovery of
the war.”
Viscount Bennett, formerly P.M. of
Canada, said in a speech in London that
the old British spirit “had not asserted
itself as in the past.” He should have
been aboard a British cruiser in the
recent Mediterranean battle. During a
lull in the fighting, with the ship reeking
with fumes and drenched with water
from enemy shell splashes, with action
about to flare again, the gunners were
served with afternoon-tea. Phlegm is a
darned hard thing to conquer.
Wonderful is the vogue of Timo-
shenko, in Parliament as well as the press.
One of his ardent admirers is Rosevear,
M.H.R., who was a non-Com. Another
is Senator A. J. McLachlan, sometime
P.M.G. and leader of the Senate, who
says he is “delighted with the success of
‘Tam o’ Shanter’ —he is so like the Tam
o’ Shanter of old.” There is not the slight-
est resemblance. Moreover, Timoshenko,
like Rommel, has been extolled while
other generals as good or better have
been overlooked. At the end of Decem-
ber London “Times” mentioned that his
armies were “menacing the main line
from Kursk to Kharkov.” They were still
menacing it at the end of March.
The 20 members of the Australia
First movement “detained” by Forde
have perhaps been reminded that there
is, in Sydney, a Legal Rights Committee.
Its title suggests that it might be per-
suaded to take up their case.
So far there has been no confirmation
of an unofficial statement that red tape
has been rationed.
Victoria’s Dunstan has been warning
his people that no time should be lost
in launching a campaign to increase food
production. For years Dunstan watched
the steady flow of food producers from
country to city and did nothing to stop
it, though he leads an Agrarian party.
It will be interesting to see how he per-
suades ex-country people to give up high
city wages and certain incomes to go back
to the land and its perils, political and
otherwise.

a bit over the 23 years it has taken to
complete the history) became familiar on
Gallipoli as he dodged along the trenches
to verify the facts he chronicled. “He
used to come up to count the bullets,” a
Digger said of him. Born at Bathurst
(N.S.W.) in 1879, Bean was educated at
Bathurst and at Oxford, and became a
barrister of the Inner Temple in 1903. In
1908 he joined “S. M. Herald” and stayed
with “Granny” until his appointment as
official correspondent.
Harold Clapp, erstwhile chairman of
the Aircraft Commission, went back to
his old job of looking after railways last
week, with the assistance of a brand-
new Director of Road Transport, a
Director of Rail Transport and two ad-
visory committees designated War Rail-
ways Committee and War Roads Com-
mittee. Clapp used to have a short way
with committees in his old slogan-making
days as chairman of the Victorian Rail-
ways Commission, and it is to be hoped
that he hasn’t lost the art of red-tape
cutting. He is 67.
Here depicted by Counihan is the first
Australian-trained Archbishop of Mel-
bourne, though he was born in England.
In 1913 Canon Baglin suggested that
Joseph John Booth should enter Ridley
College, which he did. There he came
under the influence of Dean Aicken, but
ARCHBISHOP OF MELBOURNE.
to pay his fees for the next year he got
a job as a munition worker. Going back
to his studies, he took his Th.L. with
honors and was launched into the vine-
yard. He has seen service as an army
chaplain in two wars. In the first,
around the time when he gained his
M.C., he saw a lot of the late Will Dyson,
who was frequently a guest of the Bth
Battalion mess when the artist was
sketching the Australian soldier in the
trenches. During the archbishop’s five
months abroad in this war he was with
two of the recent promotees amongst our
generals—Berryman and Beavis. He
already knows what it is to be in charge
of the Melbourne diocese —he was locum
for Archbishop Head when that eccle-
siastic attended the Lambeth Conference.
He spends most of his leisure in his gar-
den.
In Melbourne, under contract to
“News of the Day,” is Newsreel Wong,
the Chinese cameraman who cashed in
on the most spectacular story in history
up to the time Hitler erupted. His name
is Wong Hai-sheng, and he was shooting
films for an American museum when the
Chino-Jap “incident” started. He turned
his lens on Shanghai and was kidnapped
by the Japanese. Released by the British,
he accompanied the retreating Chinese
armies on their trek to the interior, and
was bombed and machine-gunned times
out of number, on one occasion being
blown up with a bridge—he scrambled
out of the water on the wrong side of a
river. A journey that should have taken
him two days took him three months
and to French Indo-China. He has given
film fanciers the horrors from London to
New York and Moscow with his shots
of the Chinese shambles. His family is
scattered from Hong Kong to Shanghai
and a brother was killed in Chiang Kai-
shek’s army. Withal, he is a typical
quiet, imperturbable Oriental.
Major-General John Dalyell Richard-
son is here depicted by Frith as scouting
for a tank on which to place a Molotov
cocktail. He would take a double delight in
doing so, first, in striking a blow for the
CHIEF GUERRILLA RICHARDSON.

second, in demolishing one of the mech-
anised monsters which have displaced the

Richardson has been a horseman all his
life and was one of the best-known
cavalry leaders in the 1914-18 scrap,
during which he rose from lieutenant
in the 7th Light Horse to command of
that regiment. Born at Raymond Ter-
race (N.S.W.), he will be 62 in a couple
of weeks.
John Thomas Paul, Maoriland’s Direc-
tor of Publicity since 1939, is an Aus-
tralian-born journalist who made his
mark in Labor circles. Born in Victoria
68 years ago, he drifted to journalism
after cycling and farming by joining a
country paper as compositor. Crossing
to M.L. in 1899 he joined the “Otago
Daily Times” as a lino, operator, later
chopped over to its literary staff and
eventually became editor of the office’s
associated weekly, the “Otago Witness.”
He held secretaryships of various trade-
unions in Dunedin, was called to the
Legislative Council in 1907 and remained
among the lotus-eaters of that body till
1919, when he resigned to contest un-
successfully a Dunedin seat. Soft-spoken
and tactful, Paul has managed to stick
to his political principles while making
friends in all parties.
No germ is allowed to roam about the
wards or passages of Melbourne’s Alfred
Hospital without the consent of Dr. R.
A. Willis, who is pathologist there. In
1934 he was appointed to membership
of the Royal College of Physicians,
London, and is now nominated as a
Fellow of the institution. Not long ago
he was invited to an important job at
London University, but the seas and the
enemy and Australian medical needs pre-
vented his acceptance,
Down for hearing on the Sydney
Divorce Court list is Dickens v.
Dickens; Sam Veller co-respondent.
Sam Veller is a Maltese. The thing
would have delighted Edward Bulwer
Lytton Dickens, son of the great Charles,
who was M.L.A. for Wilcannia (N.S.W.)
for five years (1889-94). An easygoing,
carefree chap, he rarely made a speech,
but he once interjected smartly when Nick
Willis, a character of the period, was
stonewalling. “My late father,” he said,
“once wrote the words ‘Barkis is willin’.’
If he were here tonight he would make
it ‘Willis is barkin’.’ ”
“Errol Leslie Flynn, Cinema Actor,
Author ; b. Hobart (Tas.) June 20, 1909”
(that’s how it appears in Joe Alexander’s
Who’s Who in Australia), has been
divorced by Lili Damita, his actress wife,
for “mental cruelty.” A wanderer from
birth, Flynn left the domestic hearth for
long periods, and was away yachting
when Lili presented him with a child.
The lady is to get custody of the infant,
a half-interest in property valued at
150,000 dollars and 1500 dollars a month
while Flynn’s salary is 180,000 dollars a
year. That is about 28 times what he
made when he had what for him was a
steady job in Sydney.
“M.H.”: In Passport to Hell, the M.L.
poetess “Robin Hyde” (Iris Wilkinson),
who died tragically in England a couple
of years ago, did her best prose work.
The story was a fictionised account of
the war experiences of “Starkie” —James
Douglas Stark—who, at 45, has now fol-
lowed the writer into the silent land.
Stark was mentioned in dispatches 24
times and recommended for the V.C. —
his friends said he didn’t get it because,
like most of his reckless kind, he scorned
any form of discipline. Some of his
exploits were of little or no military
value ; they simply proved that “Starkie”
had no sense of fear. “That’s not war,’
an officer once told him. “It’s great sport
though,” was Stark’s reply.
Spuds have become news, and the light
of publicity has descended on John
Taylor Ramsay, the Victorian murphy
magician, going strong at 60 after a life-
time devoted to the vegetables. His studies
and practical tests have put many Vic-
torian growers in good heart and pocket,
and his introduction of the seed-storage
crate considerably eased the job of pre-
paring and sowing the seed, as well as
causing headaches to the variety of
insect and fungoid pests which battened
on it. It was Ramsay who standardised
the two manurial dressings commonly
used, and to him also goes credit for the
seed-certification scheme.
A crop of Royal Society Fellowships
has come the way of brilliant Victorians,
among them Dr. J. K. Roberts and Col.
Neil Hamilton Fairley. The doctor was
educated at Camberwell Grammar and
Melbourne University and went with a
scholarship to Cambridge. There, while
a pupil of Rutherford, he was threatened
with tuberculosis of the spine and spent
3i years on his back in Switzerland. He
didn’t waste his time: he wrote a notable
textbook, the doing of which probably
had more to do with his cure than
the air of Switzerland. He is now work-
ing for the Admiralty. The colonel is
also a Melbourne University graduate
who went to Cambridge, where he landed
a doctorate in tropical medicine. During
the last war he studied tropical diseases,
some of the dreadest of their kind, on
the banks of the Nile. Then he came to
the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in
Melbourne. He is a Harley-street man
now.
Kenneth Murison Bourn, who has been
juggling a baton for A.8.C., takes
charge as its conductor in Hobart. His
first quavering among the crotchets was
at London Guildhall of Music, and his
main hobby was going to concerts con
ducted by Beecham, Weingartner and birds
of similar plumage. He has made strings
his specialty in Australia —Sydney fre-
quently saw him leading its string quartet
—and a couple of new works he intro-
duced were Bliss’s “Music for Strings”
and Dennington’s “Concerto Grosso.”
He will need a clear wall in his Hobart
room on which to hang his musical
honors.
Into the silence:
In Perth, at 82 or thereabouts, “Plugger
Bill” Martin, a great track cyclist in the ’nine-
ties. Irish-bom, he came to this country, with
an established reputation, from America. Aus-
tralia has known no gamer or tougher bike-
pusher nor one who made more money, though
he didn’t keep it.
At Toogoolawah (S.Q.), at 81, David Charles
Price, Queensland’s oldest cattle judge. Born
in the Shoalhaven (N.S.W.) district, he was one
of C. E. D. Mears’s lieutenants when the latter
founded the Coastal Farmers’ Co-op. Society.
Went to Queensland in 1902, took over Nestle’s
Farms in 1908 and ran them for 15 years, then
carried on dairying and stock-raising on his own
properties. One of the best-known cattle
judges in Australia and one of the few who had
judged cattle in every capital in the Common-
wealth.
In Brisbane, at 72, John Ambrose Walsh,
solicitor and authority on common and con-
stitutional law, foundation member of Royal
Queensland Golf Club, and one-time president
of the Constitutional Club and the Law Society.
He was a Gympie native.
In Melbourne, at 92, Mrs. Frances Treadway.
She end her late husband, John F., opened a
small store in Smith-street in 1876. In 1901
they opened another in Prahran, were burnt out
and rebuilt along the lines of Selfridge’s in
London. Their business continued to spread,
and in 1925 invaded the metropolis. The old
lady was also connected with Ball and Welch’s —
the wives of both those shopkeepers were her
sisters.
In Brisbane, Mary Elizabeth Weedon, the
first qualified matron of that city’s General
Hospital. A graduate of St. John’s House and
Sisterhood, London, she came to Brisbane in
1885, and later, with Dr. E. S. Jackson, estab-
lished the first training school for nurses in
Queensland.
In'Adelaide, at 61, William Harold Langham,
a former President of the Adelaide Public
Library, Museum and Art Gallery Board. Inter-
ested in libraries and books for nearly 40 years,
he persistently opposed the Public Library Bill,
which, after being shelved for years, finally
split the tripartite institution into its com-
ponent parts in 1940.
John Metcalfe, who succeeds W. H.
Ifould as Principal Librarian of Sydney’s
Public Library, had his first job with the
N. S. Wales Taxation Department, but
tossed it in in 1917 for the more human
calling of Junior Library Assistant in the
Fisher Library. He graduated from
Sydney University in 1923 and trans-
ferred himself to the Public Library in
the same year, since when he seems to
have been occupied with the library, the
whole library and nothing but the library.
Metcalfe took the Beauchamp prize in
English literature in 1927, and did a good
deal of work outside office hours; his
analysis of Australian library systems
caught the eye of the Carnegie Corpora-
tion, which offered him 2000 dollars to
visit libraries abroad. He had to take
leave without pay, but he studied
LIBRARIAN METCALFE.
libraries in the U.S.A., Canada, England,
France and Italy, and his accumulated
knowledge and ability were recognised by
Dr. Grenfell Price, M.H.R., who said of
him after his evidence in the S.A. Libraries
Inquiry, “I do not think anyone in Aus-
tralia showed such a close knowledge of
modern library systems and their work-
ings as Mr, Metcalfe.” From his office
in the old library the new Principal
Librarian can look across at the fine new
public library of which he is, justly, as
proud as a pup with two tails, and in
which he is anxious to get to work.
Lancashire-born, he is 40, active and a
good fellow.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Bo”: Our Sydney suburb had had 15
inches of rain and, Monday being a per-
fect day, the thoughts of housewives
naturally turned to washing. Runnels
of water were still seeping from water-
logged ground, and Mrs. Neighbor was
squelching over the sodden lawn with a
mouthful of pegs when the side gate
clicked. As a man entered she was about
to tell him impatiently that she didn’t
want anything today when he announced
his mission. And, after all, she really
should have been expecting him —he was
one of the Water Board’s army of vigi-
lantes on the lookout for dripping taps!
“Oliver Filter”: There were some
amusing reactions to the report that the
Government was considering restricting
expenditure on women’s clothing to £35
per head per year. Melbourne “Argus”
reeled off the proposed list, including
such thingummies as’ bloomers, scanties,
corsets or corselets and brassieres, but
“S. M. Herald” drew her skirt over her
ankles and pruned the list of anything
that sounded like underwear ; the most
“Granny” would permit, and then with
a loud blush, was “nightdresses, art. silk,
at 9s. lid.” But “Granny’s” prudery
is a virtue considered alongside the
behavior of the Sydney “Sunday
Telegraph,” which opened its columns
for a gilded young woman to squeal that
£35 wouldn’t keep her in clothes for a
month and for another moneyed dame to
snort that it might buy her silk stockings
for the year.

“K.”: “Notaden” (B. 1/4/’42) claims
that the English speak at 120 syllables a
minute. If that includes Australians
someone has made a bloomer. An odd
outbacker or two might have drawled
at a fraction of that speed at the time
when Steele Rudd caricatured them ; but
these days they talk as fast as city-
dwellers, who certainly work the jaws on
an average to the tune of more than two
syllables a second. I should say that
the average male Australian talks at a
minimum of 120 words a minute, which
would run into twice that number of
syllables. As to the women

“Clooter”: I’m glad daylight saving
has ended. Being a person of set habits,
I found it impossible to reorganise my
life in the way the Government desired.
Going to bed an hour early and rising
an hour early was simply beyond me,
with the result that one who’d had a repu-
tation for punctuality in punching the
bundy not only lost it within a few weeks
but wore out a spot on the boss’s carpet
trying to explain the consecutive lapses.
But joy hath returned ; morning finds me
on the job on time, and now it is I who
greet the boss with a lifted eyebrow as
he creeps in, minutes late,

“A.R.P.”; Having regarded myself as
an air-raid warden for some months, it
was with something verging on shock
that I was informed I would have to
pass an examination. “What for?” “In
order,” said the voice of Authority, “that
you may have a certificate.” I reminded
Authority that I had an authority card
giving me full power under the N.E.S.
Act and amendments, together with
whistle, torch, badge, brassard, pencil,
report forms, warden’s book, household
register, tin hat, respirator, white patches
for blackouts and so forth, “No matter,”
said Authority, “you must have a certi
ficate.” Well, 1 managed to scrape
through the exam., and now, woe betide
any enemy bomb that falls in our street.
I’ll gallop up, show it my certificate and
order it off the premises. If I get knocked
during a raid, moreover, all I’ll have to
do is produce my certificate and authority
card and St. Peter himself won’t be able
to keep me out.

“K. Ley”: Observing my neighbor at
some dark deed in the dead of night I
investigated, to find him grubbing out
a fruit-tree that was the pride of his
backyard, “It’s these blasted women,”
he said bitterly; “they’ve been giving
my missus hell about it, an’ she’s been
passing it on to me. So there’s only one
thing to do —root it out.” And with a
heavy heart he began to convert his Japa-
nese-plum tree into firewood.

“A Major”: A recommendation by the
Parliamentary Committee on Broadcast-
ing that broadcasting stations, national
and commercial, should devote 2\ p.c. of
their music time to works by Australian
composers deserves a cheer because Aus-
tralian composers, compared with those
of most other lands, have been having a
pretty thin time for at least 10 years.
Many circumstances have restricted pub-
lication in this country, and there can
be no doubt that a good deal of worth-
while musical material has been ploughed
under, as it were, and will never see the
light of day. A better radio market
should help to relieve that position. There
is also the consideration that while the
works of our most prolific songwriters,
such as May Brahe, Edith Harrhy and
“ That's a zac you owe me, I told y' it wasn't shatterproof!"
W. G. James, make instant appeal, the
compositions of such instrumental com-
posers as Roy Agnew, Alfred Hill, Louis
Lavater and Ernest Wunderlich (to recall
four at random) are written for musicians
rather than the general public which
means that they must be made familiar
hpfnrc thpv ran hr fnllv annreriated
before they can be fully appreciat d.
There was a lot of wisdom in the remark
of the old Kappellmeister in a small
German town who was told by the civic
fathers that the people didn’t like Wagner.
“They must hear him till they do” he
renlied nlacidlv
p lea placidly.

“Antipedant”: One of the blithe lads
who dish out journalese revised some
utterances of Priminister Curtin with the
following quaint result: —
If any such attempt succeeded, Aus-
tralia’s capacity to fight against Japan
gravely would be jeopardised.
Curtin always writes and speaks clear,
unequivocal English. Note the awful
consequence of trying to improve it—
Australia’s capacity to fight gravely is to
“Wot about me Sunday Work? Don't I get double time for that?"
be jeopardised, so that we would have to
fight laughing.

“The Haythen”: Up at Caboolture (Q.)
some patriot burned down the Lutheran
Church about a year ago, doubtless feel-
ing in some vague way that he was aid-
ing the British cause. The faneless pastor
arranged for the use of the Anglican
church, but many Anglicans objected ;
then a threat was issued —it was
chalked on a blackboard at the
State school —that, if Lutherans did
get the use of the Anglican church,
that, too, would be burned. Later
it was announced on the Anglican notice
board: “This church is not being used
by Lutherans.” Presumably Anglicans
can now enter the place without laying
themselves open to a charge of consort-
ing with the enemy.

“Lao-dah”: Hedges, secretary of the
Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind,
is up against a man-power problem. He
employs 150 blind adults in a factory
which produces £60,000 worth of
material, mainly for the war effort. But
the sighted workers engaged are being
called up under the man-power scheme.
The blind workers are uncannily efficient
in fending for themselves, and they even
appreciate the change wrought by the
evacuation scheme which has taken them
from their home in St. Kilda-road to the
lovely landscape of Olinda which they
cannot see. But if there are too few
sighted workers they cannot work at all.

“Avon”: Wellington, Maoriland’s capi-
tal, lightening its war-time labors with
a spot of music, made a good job of
an amateur production of “Maritana,”
which, of course, provoked a flood of
biographical details concerning that very
picturesque fiddler William Vincent Wal-
lace, and equally, of course, a suggestion
that the inspiration for “Scenes That Are
Brightest” came to Vincent while he
gazed from the balcony of Barrett’s
Hotel, Wellington. There is also a pub at
Devonport, Tas., that claims the honor.
But Wallace had also sojourned in Syd-
ney and most of the cities of India and
South America before he scored “Mari-
tana” —a job which he started and fin-
ished in a back street in London, where the
scene was anything but bright. However
inspired, it was a remarkable perform-
ance—nowadays sneered at publicly and
loved privately in about equal parts.

“Lao-dah”: Funny how completely

Melbourne morning daily recently re-
ported the arrival of some Australian

My morning informer has become so
accustomed to clean-shaven or faintly-
moustached heroes, like Clark Gable win-
ning the V.C. three times daily on the
screen, that it unconsciously associates
beards with senility. This tyranny of the
associations found a queer extension in
the young Melbourne woman who told a
well-known artist at an art show that
she liked his pictures very much—they
were so virile; but she didn’t like his
beard because it made him look “so
effeminate.”
“Bumble” delves into Sydney’s muni-
cipal archives;
A contemporary account of Sydney’s first
municipal election, just a hundred years ago,
suggests that it was a livelier function than the
last one we had. The thing was written by
J. C. Byrne in a book called Twelve Years’
Wanderings in the British Colonies. “In an-
other part the writer saw a still worse scene
enacted. Near the signal station at the north end
of the town there had been erected a polling
booth. During the excitement the tent which
partly composed it had been pulled down, and
one of the candidates, a shipowner of the colony,
had been maltreated, and several others hurt
Without applying to the authorities the shipownei
proceeded to the bay, where he had several
whalers lying, and, arming some scores of their
crews with harpoons, whaling knives and other
formidable weapons, returned with them to the
place of polling, and with cold steel swept
mob and electors from the place, but not with-
out a desperate resistance, in which several
persons were severely injured. This was rather
a novel way of carrying an election; the gentle-
man—as he was called in the colony—was
afterwards tried for severely stabbing a person
with a cane sword on the occasion, and escaped
conviction with difficulty.”

“Uramao”: An 18-months baby in the
Wairarapa (M.L.) district has the medical
and dietary quidnuncs scratching their
heads and stroking their chins. Though
normal in other respects —it won first
prize in a show —its antipathy to milk is
pronounced. A drop of milk or even
the touch of a milk-stained cloth brings
out a blister on the baby’s skin. It has
been found that fluid extract from soya
bean best suits the child’s queer consti-
tution.
TEA.
Full many a bard in many a line
Has sung the praise of many a brew,
From humming ale to ruby wine,
Beloved by Bacchus and his crew.
And Burns’s favorite tipple, too,
Has had its meed of minstrelsy.
Tis strange how singularly few
Have penned a stave in praise of tea.
A score of tavern lays you’ll find,
Produced by bards in every age,
Invariably come to mind
When Prohibition takes the stage.
But only Olney’s poet-sage,
Cowper, so far as history states,
Enthused about the beverage
“That cheers but not inebriates.”
Innocuous and salubrious drink,
For long the product of Cathay,
Which Samuel Johnson loved to sink
At any hour of night or day,
Which helps the swagman on his way
Into the bubbling billy thrown,
Tis time and more than time, I’ll say,
You had a laureate of your own.
Will no aspiring bard pipe up,
No rhymer rise in bush or town,
And hymn the magic of the cup
To conquer care and thirst to drown?
A deeper note his lilt will crown
And with more poignancy he’ll speak
Now that our ration’s whittled down
To just one meagre ounce a week.

ALPHABETICAL ASHLEY.
Senator Ashley, Minister for Information, said
that he was not perturbed by sectional criticisms of
his anti-Japanese “hate broadcasts.”
He’s unperturbed. He’s made it his objective
To help to win the war by cutting loose
With slathers of hysterical invective
And solid chunks of rancorous abuse.
He sees his hymns of hate as a corrective
To poisons that the other side produce ;
The sort of stuff they hear who listen in
To what’s diffused from Tokyo and Berlin.
Fas est doceri et ab haste — learning
May well be gathered, even from the foe
Nor would he limit it to matters turning
On points that military men should know.
He’s just as keen on using tips concerning
Vituperative braggadocio;
He’d share whatever comfort Goebells gets
From snorting evil names and screeching threats.
He’s unperturbed. Flamboyantly and flashly
He blasts his way along the path he’s set.
Can no one muzzle this outrageous Ashley,
This chap who owes his job, one can t
forget— . , .
And who is there will hint I m speaking
rashly? —
To his position in the alphabet?
These vulgar outbursts decent men abhor
Are not the words to help us win the war.

“D.E.”: From that dear old-young
Labor paper “S. M. Herald”:
Mr. Gandhi is reported to have described
the British proposals for Dominion status
for India as a post-dated cheque. Ihe
definition is somewhat cryptic, if not neces-
sarily inimical. There is nothing wrong
with post-dated cheques as such.
Obviously the “Herald” writer is one of
those newspapermen who have never had
the experience of getting post-dated
cheques in their pay envelopes. I have
had it—and them —and I have always
cherished a regard for the next-door
publican who acted as the staff’s banker
for four hazardous weeks. And, like
Gandhi, I have a lingering prejudice in
favor of cash.

“F.S.”: Australia’s war-time re-
strictions on the manufacture of cosmetics
may yet be the unwitting instrument for
fixing new and more natural standards
of feminine beauty. How far those stand-
ards can be fixed along the lines of dis-
tortion is shown by the well-authenticated
history of the tribe in Central Africa
whose women distend their lips a foot or
so by inserting soup-plates in them. It was
the Arab slave-traders who unwittingly
fixed the fashion. In order to prevent
the traders getting away with their most
beautiful women the males of the tribe
compelled their girls to deliberately
make themselves unattractive by incising
their lips and sticking hard objects in
them. But what started as a deliberate
mutilation became an adornment and the
original purpose of it was forgotten. The
girl with the largest soup-plate in her lip
was the most likely to get a husband, and
a mother was only being unkind to her
daughter if she didn’t equip her in the
proper fashion. So a thing that most
other people can’t even look at without
their stomachs turning over became the
standard of aesthetic beauty,

“Yair”: Mention of Henry Lawson’s
unacademic language (B. 25/3/’42) re-
minds me of an acquaintance who never
mentioned Lawson without adding some
rather unpoetic comments about Lawson’s
father. “The old man had no right to
change the family name,” he said the first
time I heard him on the subject. “It
was a good Norwegian name —Laerson.
The Great Australian Poet should by
rights have had a good Norwegian name.
Damn’ lot of rot to change to Lawson
from the uncommonly good name of
Laerson.” “What’s your name?” I asked
suspiciously. “Well,” he said, “it’s not
that I’m prejudiced, but —well, if you
must know, my name’s Laerson.”

Melbourne’s police technical officer, says
it is impossible to install a siren system
which could be heard inside all city build-
ings and factories, and even inside subur-
ban homes in which perhaps a wireless
set or a vacuum cleaner was working.
If that were so, air-raid warnings
wouldn’t be very effective. But it isn’t
true, as any musician could tell Mr.
Arnot. The note selected for Melbourne’s
ridiculous sirens is exactly the same pitch
as the normal volume of the city traffic.
Increasing its volume doesn’t make it
more penetrating, a fact known to every
stockbroker. When a woolbuyer wants
to make his voice heard above general
conversation he instinctively raises the
pitch of his voice, and the auctioneer
gives him wholehearted attention. All
the A.R.P. people have to do is to raise
the pitch of their sirens a trifle.

“S.T.S.”: I have just found the play-
bill of the only time I was ever inside
Hec Majesty’s Theatre, Sydney ; it must
have been in January, 1889. George
Rignold (the only name in large type)
was playing lead in the Drury Lane
spectacle “Youth” ; Mrs. Rignold was a
young officer, in support, Sweeney,
Hazlitt (stage manager also), Greville,
Harcourt, Stirling Whyte, Kate Bishop,
Emily Fitzroy, Athena Claudius, Roland
Watts-Phillips, and an immense cast of
“soldiers, convicts, wardens, villagers,
sailors, etc.” Frank Eugarde conductor,
performance 7.30 to 10.45. An odd point
is “the magnificent scenery by Messrs.
Little and Clint.” No details are given,
though an accompanying puff stresses
“the large troopship moving off from
the pier,” and “the battle with Arabs in
the Seventh Act.” Also, Rignold had
improved on Augustus Harris and Drury
Lane by getting the British Army into a
tight place (after all, as Kipling reminds
us, Fuzzy-Wuzzy did “break a British
square”), and bringing “the Australian
Contingent to the Rescue; Death or
Glory.”

“Uramao”: “S.T.S.’s” reference to
Tom Playford’s preference for Prime Min-
ister over Premier (B. 21/1/ ’42) reminds
that Maoriland’s Joe Ward had a similar
fancy. When Maoriland was raised to
the status of a Dominion, Joe at an early
opportunity protested in the House
against being called Premier and ex-
plained that Prime Minister was his
correct designation. Sleek, plump and
well-dressed like M.L.’s mutton and
lamb, the baronet was not perturbed
when a facetious member asked whether
there was not some analogy between
Prime Minister and Prime Canterbury.

“Spokeshave”: A Melbourne citizen,
one of those very efficient fellows, de-
cided to carry out A.R.P. in the spirit

of sleep!”
air-raid test in the bosom of his house-
hold. Having carefully drilled the family
for several days in the correct manoeuvres,
one night he suddenly blew the alert on
a tin whistle and then the “Air Raid
Impending.” Without a trace of panic
his well-disciplined wife and family
walked out of the house to the air-raid
shelter in the backyard and waited. He
stayed behind to don his equipment, turn
off the gas, switch the lights off, open the
windows, etc., in accordance with the
regulations. The family waited. One
minute passed, then two minutes, then
ten, but no daddy. Finally his wife de-
cided that an investigation was called
for and sent out her daughter. The child
returned looking as if she had seen a
ghost. “Daddy must have been hit by a
bomb,” she stuttered. “He’s lying dead
at the back door!” He wasn’t dead: he
had only been knocked unconscious. He
had been so taken in by his own realistic
performance that he had rushed head-
long out of the back door into the
clothesline.

“F.S.”: One of the silliest of Austra-
lian newspaper shibboleths is the cry for
“young men.” Newspapers that indulged
in it now find themselves in
position of having to extol General Mac-
Arthur, who is 62. There is no funda-
mental merit in being young. Titian
painted his best picture when he was 90.
When he was 20 all he could do was to
repeat the prejudices of the academies
that taught him. So, though he was
physically older at 90 than he was at 20,
he was intellectually younger. Bernard
Shaw at 84 is mentally younger than the
youthful members of the intelligentsia
who call him an old fogey. Freud at 80
had younger ideas than the young lady
fresh from finishing school who believes
everything about sex that her grand-
mother and her teachers taught her. It
is the same with soldiers. A young officer
who has had a brilliant career at some
military academy may have his head
stuffed with ideas out of textbooks com-
piled by professors who never saw a shot
fired in anger. To all intents and pur-
poses he is an old man. But a general
who understands military science in terms
of his own experience may be mentally
younger at 60 than the textbook man
at 30.

“Hamer”: Saint Pathrick’s day, is ut?
Time was when the greenest day of all
the year was (with one exception) the
easiest day to buy a fight; the exception
was July 12. On both days there were
clashes both in Melbourne and Sydney
—more especially in Melbourne, which
always did take these matters more seri-
ously than Sydney—between the wearers
of green and yellow. I bought myself a
spot of bother one March 17 by inadver-
tently wearing a tie with a yellow stripe
in it. The elderly Pat with the shamrock
in his buttonhole opposite me in the train
was obviously working up a fury about
it as his eyes fixed on my neckwear; it
erupted as a hefty young chap with a
green-hued tie entered the train. The
smoulder in the elderly Pat burst into
flame as he began “Look at the cursed
Orangeman! It’s insultin’ us he is!”
with obvious intent to incite the young
giant. “It’s no business of mine,” said
the latter. “My name’s Moses.” Actually,
as I learnt on a subsequent meeting, it
was O’Sullivan. He was typical of the
rising generation of Australian Irish
which sees more significance in Wattle
Day than in the anniversary of the Battle
of the Boyne.
“Bumpkin”: War’s contrasts, is it?
Just before the outbreak a thief charged
out of a jeweller’s shop in Melbourne
with a tray of diamonds, tripped and
fell. The diamonds shot all over the
pavement. There was a wild rush of
passers-by to recover the stolen gems,
and eventually every one was restored to
its rightful owner. The other day a case
of tea crashed off a lorry in a suburb
and burst. The driver passed on un-
heeding. Housewives rushed out of their
dwellings with buckets, tins and sauce-
pans, and by the time the driver returned
to the scene there was scarcely a sker-
rick remaining.

“L. de R.”; I see that Colonel Hicks,
Inspector-General of Army Catering,
considers that an unbroken supply of
fresh garden and orchard, products is
essential for national health and morale
and that a start should be made straight-
way to repair the fall in fruit and vege-
table production. Well, a friend of mine
thought the same thing, so he got an
ordinary domestic tank, set it up next
to a Board of Works tank and then
wrote to the board for permission to fill
his tank from theirs so that he could
irrigate a patch of tomatoes and other
veges. He got no reply and wrote an-
other letter. After a month had elapsed
he rang up the department, but nobody
knew about his application. A personal
visit finally brought an inspector out to
see the installation. There followed an-
other long delay, and then the potential
savior of the nation got a letter from the
board telling him it had no objection to
his using its water, but the tank must
be taken down and placed further from
its own tank, presumably lest he try to
defeat the regulations by syphoning the
moisture out with a hose or dipping it
out with a spoon. In the meantime the
season for growing tomatoes had passed,
also the necessity for irrigation; and
there the empty tank remains.

“L.P.”: I like to hear of the scrap-
ping ability of the redoubtable Paddy
Finucane (B. 18/3/’42), but my Celtic
blood bubbles when radio announcers
pronounce his name “Fin-you-can,”
“Fin-you-cane,” “When-you-can,” etc. I
feel ’tis another “injustice.” The Gaelic
form of the name is O’Finagaun, the “O,”
of course, signifying grandson and Fina-
gaun “little fair man” —what an Austra-
lian might call “little snowy.” The clan
claims descent from “Conn of the Hun-
dred Battles,” and Paddy’s record should
soon equal or beat that of his pugnacious
ancestor —I can picture the long-deceased
Conn, if he recognises the much-contorted
name, grabbing his shillelagh and throw-
ing his caubeen in the air when the air-
man’s exploits are broadcast in Tir-na-
noge, the Valhalla of Milesian warriors.
The clan still, when in sentimental mood,
calls itself by the old moniker, but for
general purposes Finnagan or Finnikin is
near enough.

Our debt to the Dutch:
When Dutchmen came to Australia in the
early seventeenth century they followed two
tracks. The first led them along the south coast
of New Guinea and down the Gulf of Carpen-
taria, which they named after the Governor-
General of the N.E.I. When the Arnhem was
blown westward across it in 1623 her crew dis-
covered a country they named “Arnhemsland.”
Along the other path they came sailing from
the Cape of Good Hope to Java. Instead
of following the old route along the coast of
Africa they stood about 4000 miles eastward
from the Cape before they went north, and so
often used to strike the Westralian coast by
accident, several ships managing to get them-
selves wrecked on the Abrolhos islands. Ship
after ship sighted the coast of what they called
“the South Land,” and gradually their dis-
coveries were put together until, in 1628, a
Dutch cartographer drew an exceedingly accu-
rate map showing the western coast of Aus-
tralia—-New Holland to the Dutchmen —from
the Leeuwin to a river they called Willems
River, near the North-west Cape, and the
southern from Cape Leeuwin to the head of
the Bight.
“Red Earth”: The “pincers move-
ment” mentioned every day in the war
news is old stuff. The earliest reference
I can find is dated 54 b.c. Julius Caesar
used it during his second invasion of
Britain. It is recorded that, after crossing
the Thames, Caesar marched northward,
assisted by the Trinovantes, to Verula-
mium (St. Albans), where Cassivel-
launus, chief of the tribe of Catuvel-
launi, made his first stand. Caesar
attacked on two sides, and easily cap-
tured the place with a great quantity of
booty.

“The Ancient” recalls a duel: —•
Early Australian history has records of several
notable duels, such as that between John Mac-
arthur and Lieut.-Colonel Paterson, but there
are one or two still remembered of a much
later date. Near Westernport (Vic.) Dr. Barker
and Alfred Meyrick had an “affair of honor”
in the eighteen-forties. They were neigh-
boring squatters who had quarrelled over the
possession of a waterhole situated about a mile
from Meyrick’s homestead. Meyrick wanted
to clean it out, but as fast as his men exca-
vated the sand Barker’s lads filled it in again.
So Meyrick sent the doctor a challenge, and
a day or two later they confronted one another
with muzzle-loading duelling pistols, seconds
and surgeons complete. They tossed for first
shot, and Meyrick’s second won. Meyrick
seems to have meant business, for he sent his
bullet through Barker’s top-hat. Barker then
fired in the air. Meyrick was satisfied, and
the dispute adjusted itself, but for many years
the meeting was the great topic of those parts.
“Are we lucky, Joe? Got a signed contrack for two five-thousand
tonners."


ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”: The dry spell broke with
a deluge that soon had old Harry wor-
ried, The water was mounting on the
flat and beginning to lap at the hut door-
step. He decided it would be safe to
stay another night. Next morning the
water was a foot deep in the hut and
rising, and between Harry and safety
was a six-foot-deep torrent, and Harry
couldn’t swim. He thought the matter
over, then lashed a couple of empty kero.-
tins together, plugged the holes, tied them
across his chest and launched forth. A
hundred yards downstream the tins
tangled in a treetop, and there, despite
all his exertions, Harry stayed. Just on
dark the boat from the station found
him. They hauled him aboard, drained
most of the water out of him and poured
a double-header of whisky into him. He
sat up, looked at the flood with a shiver
and said feelingly “I’ll never dip another
sheep.”

“Sailor Bill”: Caught unawares while
nipping my banana suckers, the small
wallaby fled, hotly pursued by the fox-
terriers. The first dog was two feet
from its tail when the reddish-grey form
got clear of the bananas and dived from
view beneath a rock, the base of which
was covered with a straggling bush. The
dog tried to follow, but leaped back with
an anguished howl immediately he
touched the vegetable. The remaining
tykes plunged recklessly into the green
mass of the heart-shaped leaves, then
promptly went into reverse with pained
yelps. Two of them tore for home ; the
others wandered disconsolately abqut,
alternately sneezing violently and scrub-
bing their dials against the ground. I
knew then that the base of the “pudding
stone” and the entrance to the rock-
wallaby’s burrow were covered with
Gympie stinging trees in good stinging
condition after the heavy rains.

“Pat Pending”: “The coves y’ get work-
in’ for y’ these days ain’t got the brains
of a consumptive louse,” old Dan said.
“Y’ know that there dopey coot
Charlie I had graftin’ for me? Well,
we’re ridin’ the creek pullin’ out bogged
cows when we came acrost one. of the
missus’s greatest pets. In real bad she
was, and been there a few days, too, be
the look of her. ‘Cripes!’ I says, ‘the
missus’ll go clean mad if she sees this.
Here, you duck off home and sneak the
shotgun outa the shed and shoot her
before she finds out.’ I carries on up
the creek and sees no more of him till
I lands home about four o’clock and
get the daylights nearly scared outa me
be seeing him half hiding under a big
bush near the gate with the gun at the
ready. ‘Here!’ I yells, ‘what the hell’re
you doin’ there?’ ‘Aw, it’s orright,’ he
says, ‘only the missus has been away all
day over to Johnston’s visitin’, and I
been planted here waitin’ till she comes
back.’ ”

“Propalong”: Old Mac had the notion
that it was cheaper to run a station with a
large percentage of boy and jackeroo labor.
His boundary-rider out at Deadman’s
Well was imported and not exactly chock-
full of initiative. Nevertheless he seemed
to get along all right—so well, in fact,
that, needing him to help at a crutching
bee, Mac rang him up, asked about the
water supply and the big geared mill,
and told him to come straight into the
station for a couple of days. The couple
of days’ work extended into a week, but
as the March gales were roaring down
we knew there’d be plenty of water at
the Deadman. Then, after a final week-
end at the homestead, Choom went back.
He reached his camp and rang frenziedly
for the boss. Mac tore out in the buck-
board to find a few hollow-flanked sheep
hanging on the sand-filled troughs and
a useless windmill clanging like a boiler-
maker’s shop. The oil pump had broken
evidently a few days before Choom left
for the head station. The mustering
camp saved 2500 of the 3000-odd sheep
in the two paddocks. It cost Mac £6O
in repairs and labor as well, and he’s
not so keen on cheap labor now.

“Wire-buster”: Old Joe ruled the line
gang more by his ability to think quickly
on a cold wet morning and give a mild
reprimand where a hasty word would
have caused friction. A bitterly cold
westerly blew straight and low across
Breadalbane Plains one morning when
Joe said to his gang gathered round the
fire “We’ll shift them logs off the route
down by the road”; then, turning to
Curly, he went on: “You can take an
axe and clean them trees up down by
the five-mile.” Curly took a look round
the threatening horizon, shrugged himself
a bit further into his coat and said dis-
gustedly, “Cripes, if I’d known that last
night I’d ha’ sent the missus along and
spent the day in bed!” “All right,” said
old Joe mildly. “Fetch her along. You
can go on digging pole-holes.”

“Sur Cingle”; Of all the nuisances on
a saddle the old quartpot is the worst.
Whether it’s a half-round or oval
Queensland model or just the old round
type; whether it’s slung in a neat case,
buckled to dees or hung by a strap,
sooner or later, generally when its owner
is getting on, it will make trouble for
him. I’ve seen a man get a nasty buster
when a dirty mule slipped into it unex-
pectedly and, the rider being skied tem-
porarily, his loosely-hung pot flew up
between his seat and the saddle’s. Often,
as youngsters, we used to go without mid-
day tea rather than carry the things. But
one old-time manager would never allow
this. “Put your quartpot on, son,” was
his order. “You young blokes get too
liverish without tea and then you knock
your horses about or lap along home
with a job half done,”

of wire. The boss once pitched the camp
in a gully to be near the trickle that
spilled over a 10ft. weir a quarter-mile
farther up. One moonlit night with an
up-gully wind I was drafted out to lie on
top and keep a tally of those that came
to soak and fill their hides. Leaning
over too far to read a brand, I tumbled
in front of the gulping scrubbers, which
instantly wheeled. Bellowing and bawl-
ing, they tore down the gully in a mad
rush, smashing into the camp. Buck-
boards, bullocks, gear, tents, yells and
bellows surged and whirled while the
cyclone lasted. As I sneaked back in my
wet ensemble, I was relieved to see the
ringers and the boss following the circus.
They retrieved sufficient to enable our
camp to be known as “The Bitsers” by
the bush wags. The boss never asked
for my report; but here it is—a mere
hundredth of the mob that skittled Bill.

“Mat’s Mate”: The big fellow was
tramping down the Wakool and picked
up a mate near the Dead Hole bridge.
The mate didn’t have much to say but
he had plenty to sing, and mile after mile
"What makes you think I'd make a
good soldier?"
“ You're full of the offensive spirit!"
Mat was treated to a variety of ditties,
ballads, dirges and hymns, all beefed out
in a flat nasal tone and with little idea
of beat or tempo. That night, camped
under a culvert on the way to Kerang,
Mat’s patience broke. “Listen,” he de-
manded, “do y’ hafta sing all the ruddy
time!” The other seemed a trifle aston-
ished. “Gripes,” he said, “I thought y’
liked me voice. I thought I was cheerin’
y’ up.” He was so obviously pained that
Mat’s anger melted. “Aw, y’r voice is
all right,” he said gently; “it’s just that
I think if I was accompanying y’ on a
tin whistle your voice’d be pitched on
the wood between the holes!”

“Tonsilitis”: In a recent Bulletin
short story a character said of the eyes
of a possum about to be shot, “In a
minute they’ll be closed for ever.” If it
was meant only figuratively, well and
good ; but to me it conveyed the impres-
sion of the oft-believed fallacy that a
dead animal’s eyes are shut naturally.
When animals die their muscles relax
completely, and as shutting the eyes is a
muscular motion these organs will remain
open.

“Bell R.”: Out at Wellington (N.S.W.)
there is a store run by Australian-born
Chinese, at which no bagman is ever
denied an issue of tea and sugar. This
legacy was left to the padfloggers by the
former owner of the store as a mark of
eternal gratitude to the bagman who,
many years ago, dragged the Celestial’s
offspring from the flooded river at great
risk to himself. I’m reminding every-
body of it because I’m wondering, in
face of the ounce-a-week tea ration to
registered customers, how the present
owners of the store —if they’re still there
—propose to maintain the terms of the
legacy.

“Dairi”; A traveller had sold the boss
a wireless set, but the old man scorned
the suggestion that he have it
licensed. Then one day he came
rushing into the house all excited.
Throw a blanket over the wire-
ished towards the dairy suddenly
remembering the long-forgotten
registration and the long-neglected
dairy. The sergeant saw her. As
he was about to go into a long
discourse on the rules and regula-
tions she interrupted with “Have
an apple, Sarge—these Rome
Beauties are pretty good; and try
one of these and these,” filling his
pockets with fruit. When the Law
did manage to get a word .in he
humbly suggested that the dairy license
be cancelled—it wasn’t a place to keep
fruit, anyway. The boss went off to town
the next morning and took out a wireless
license.

“K. Gee”: Horses identify humans by
sound, smell and sight—in that order.
A quiet mare of my neighbor’s, on hear-
ing the voice of a former cruel owner
whom she had not heard for eight years,
immediately became alarmed and raced
to the farthest corner of the yard, shaking
and whistling with fear. Strange horses
tremble and snort when I approach them.
Suspecting I had an obnoxious smell a
friend put his arm around the neck of
his sulky nag and spoke soothing words
to it while I silently came up behind.
Although the animal could neither see
nor hear me it stamped about and blew
its nostrils in fear. I’m a tame horse-
boss, and nags that know me raise no
objection to my particular odor.

“Scuta”: Queerest bush memorial I’ve
struck is on the Murchison goldfield. Some
years ago a foreign doctor drifted to
W.A. and was appointed to an outback
hospital. By his ability and easy manner he
soon overcame local prejudice. But he
could not repel a frontal attack of pneu-
monia. A colleague, unwilling that, a
stranger in a strange land, he should lie
unhonored, set his brass plate over the
grave;—
Dr.
Hours: 9.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m.
2 p.m. to 3 p.m.
7 p.m. to 8 p.m.
He likes to think that the shades of the
departed, all language difficulties gone,
consult the spirit of the doc, about those
ills from which, he fancies, even the
dead are not immune.

“Don McM.”; Nugget O’Regan had
reached that stage in his consumption
of fermented and spirituous where
he developed fits of brooding over
the wrongs of his Irish ancestors. Just
as the tough-looking stranger entered the
bar. Nugget tore into the middle of the
floor, eyes blazing and fists at their battle
stations. “Who fears to speak of ’Ninety-
eight,” he bellowed. “Gripes,” drawled
the stranger, “ninety-eight’s nothing to
skite about.” In no time the room was
full of right swings, uppercuts and wild
haymakers. When the mob got the
would-be killers apart, Joe Chalker told
the stranger off for being such a mug to
bite about a rebellion that didn’t concern
Aussies, anyway. “Rebellion!” snorted
the stranger. “Strike me fat! I thought
’e was skitin’ about ’is shearin’ tally!”

“Beamish”: Thought I’d struck some-
thing new when in the Barraba (N.S.W.)
district I saw a black snake that had been
killed by wood ticks. Since then the
same fate has overtaken members of
the Blake family on the Liverpool Plains
(N.S.W.). Is this common?

“Ophir”: Over many years I’ve tested
pretty well every kind of snake, from
rock pythons to ordinary grass fellows
about six inches long, for staying power,
and my decision is that no Joe is good

it was bellows-to-mend after 50 yards.
Most I struck petered out after a gallop
of 25 yards.

To hold the design
Of his delicate web

With the sap of his body
A home in the leaves.

“Wippegong”: I am sitting by the
Murrumbidgee in the country which in-
spired All That Swagger, and in which
the tale itself was set. The river is low;
a flock of wood duck is feeding on a
sandbank downstream, a pair of herons
and a white egret are wading beyond,
three black ducks have whistled by and
a wedgetail is poised aloft. Long
shadows from the river oaks stretch far
along the bank and from the branches
above a strong southerly is drawing the
whine which was the wail of the banshee
to “me brave Johanna.” The road to
Mt. Franklin follows much the same
curves as those hewn by the Danny
Delacys who first trod them; but the
surface is good and in places winds
through ordered forests of young pine.
But in spite of this, and although the
mail ’plane has just droned over, it is
still wild country. The lapping of the
river behind me, the flood-piled hill of
sand in front, the native pine and lichen
gracing the cliff face which causes the
bend below, the waterfowl and the great
beetling ridges sharp against the sunset
all suggest countless ages ; and the very
smallness of man-made changes pays
tribute to the courage of those who first
attempted them. Sundown, and I have
far to go. But on the way through the
national capital I will pass the National
War Memorial, recently opened with
deserving dignity. There is room beside
it for a memorial to pioneers; that
record would help to explain the other.

“The 0.D.”: Old Dockerty had lived
alone down in the bend for so long that
most people believed he was the man
who’d dug the Murray. In our more
generous moments we frequently took
him food dainties, books, cast-off
blankets, etc., and when the wireless
came we gave him our old gramophone
and records. As the years passed
“Go an' get one of your own — there's plenty more!”
Dockerty failed until he was confined
to moving about the immediate vicinity
of his hut, but his independence was as
strong as ever and he maintained his
isolation. Then came the flood that
swept most of his camp away. We had
a working-bee, built and equipped a new
hut. The gramophone, his greatest
treasure, was wrecked, so we bought a
second-hand radio and batteries and
handed them over. About a month later
Tom called to see him and asked how
the set was going. “You fellers,”
wheezed Dockerty, “ain’t got any brains.
Y’ forgot t’ get a handle f’r it an’ I
can’t wind it up.” His amazement when
shown how to work the switch and knobs
iH d Tom with a tonic for months
provided tom wim a topic ror monins.

“Looby”: These outback heroes who
slice a sheep in double-quick time or
skin a kangaroo in less have nothing to
skite about. Give ’em a mosquito to dis-
sect and they’d have to be true artists.
According a tome I’ve been browsing
over it’s all very simple. You need
chloroform, dissecting forceps, micro-
scope and a few other trinkets, but other-
QriV . it a no
wlse an V swaggie could give it a go.
After the head and legs are off and the
mosquito is prepared and placed in the
r jght position (thorax first), you get to
work with forceps, etc., and finally “press
the cover glass down gently while you
move the mosquito to the left with the
ft hand. In this manner the glands are
ou( and , eft under » he cover
glass. ...” Isn’t that easy? To get a
mossie’s stomach out is even less trouble.
You start by making a small opening in
the dorsal wall of the abdomen (only the
dorsal wall, mind), and finally you grab
the tip of the abdomen with the forceps
and slowly and reverently draw the
stomach right out. Now, as any bush-
man knows, this is the ideal method of

In the days when the Cabbage Garden
was still a mining camp, and the rabbit
really was a plague, we kids used to find
wonderful sport chasing them around the
old mine dumps. At Haddon there were
hundreds of small dumps, each about
six feet high and 15 to 20 feet across ; in
the centre an untimbered shaft, perhaps
50ft. deep. Long abandoned, even then
Haddon was a rabbit city; every dump
a warren, riddled through and through
with burrows. But the oddest thing was
that, though the burrows opened freely
to each other, never would one be found
that opened into the central shaft,
Bunny evidently realised that danger lay
in that direction, and knew just when to

“Yair”: When the river suddenly de-

nuisance, Crowtown was soon completely
under water and the rain still showed
no sign of easing off. The whole town-
"All right— tenner a Week or I work in a munitions joint!"
ship was covered —that is, the post-office-
general-store, old Riley’s shack, the
Whitcombs’ place, the five assorted out-
buildings and the pigsty. Whitcomb and
Riley sat on Whitcomb’s roof, holding
a few fowls and a couple of suitcases
between them. Riley was positive that
help would shortly arrive from Warrigal
Bend, but Whitcomb was full of gloom.
“Me missus is away at her mother’s for
a bit,” he explained ; “when she hears
of this I’ll get it.” “Why? It ain’t your
fault,” said Riley, drawing his Shanks
up a bit further as the water sneaked
higher. “No, and I’ve saved what live-
stock and as much of her clobber as I
can,” said Whitcomb miserably, “but
she hates waste. And I forgot to turn
the tap off, so when the flood goes down
she’ll find I’ve let the tank go dry! ”

“M.Q.”: Judged by his criticism of
“Youanmi’s” statements re the similarity
of modes of propulsion in fish and ships
“Bughouse” (B. 18/3/ ’42) should examine
a bird’s wing more closely and visit
an aquarium. The frontal edge of a
bird’s wing is more or less rigid, the rear
tips composed of fine, lighter feathers. In
the up- or down-stroke of flight these
rear tips “lag” behind the forward
sections of the wing, with the result that
the surface is curved. From this curved
surface the air is “pushed” in exactly
the same manner as from the curved
surface of a ’plane propeller. In the latter
action the motion is circular, or really
from side to side ; the former is up and
down—that’s all. Exactly the same thing
happens when a fish goes into action.
Have a look at Auntie’s goldfish, and
note the graceful “wavy” motion of its
rear as it curves to and fro.
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: If the mob have finally
decided whether a Riverina amateur
meteorologist or Jupiter was responsible
for asking Hughie to send the rain down,
I’d like to get in with these: Was the
late Queen Ann the original Annie whose
upstairs room is always given as the
hiding-place of any article inquired for?
And who was Kirby, from whose demise
most things are dated? (“I haven’t had
a drink since Kirby died,” etc.) Then
there is the mysterious Billy Hicks, the
unknown gent, who leaves gates open
and suchlike. Little Audrey, the lady
with the keen sense of humor, is also
clouded in mystery. Perhaps the delvers
in the past can also explain why a man
with a grievance lugubriously refers to
himself as “poor Phil Garlick.”
* * $ *
“Sou’-west”: Have never seen wild cats
other than grey. Other colors, of course,
must be born into the litters, but they
probably fall victims while in the kitten
stage to predatory birds of the eagle tribe
because of lack of protective coloration.
And what terrible creatures these grey
wild cats become, especially to the settler
trying to run a few head of poultry. The
average domestic cat baulks at anything
much above the fluffy chi6ken stage, but
the bush-born cat will take full-grown
fowls, specialising in the snatching of
a sitting hen from her eggs. Have even
known big toms to take muscovy ducks.
It’s dangerous, too, for an unarmed man
to corner ope, for, being a veritable tiger
in miniature —teeth, claws and stringy
muscle —the cat will show fight, coming
straight at the only avenue of escape. No
cowering in a corner for him or her.
Difficult to trap, too, by any machine of
the spring-jaw type; though readily
enough taken in a box trap with a falling
door, a raw fish being an irresistible bait.
But though trapped this way the cat is
neither caught nor killed —that provides
the real thrill. For it takes some nerve to
hold a chaff bag to the opening while the
other bloke lifts the door and by means
of a stick persuades the yowling and spit-
ting occupant to enter the bag. And just
as soon as the cat comes charging out of
the trap the bag needs to be tied down
short, denying the occupant any move-
ment, lest its inch-long claws reach
through the sacking and fiercely rake its
captors. The cold water cure comes next.

“Esk. D.”: The two middle-aged city
women who with their respective broods
had sought safety in the rural fastnesses
of Drygrass occupied the place next to
Mullins. On him they soon learned to rely
for advice in their new projects, and as
Mullins reckoned he got good value in
free entertainment it suited both parties.
First, they acquired a cow and he taught
them to milk it; then from somewhere
came a broody hen, and they decided to
hatch some chickens. After preliminary
instructions had been given, one lady
asked how long the eggs took to hatch.
“Three weeks for fowls, four for ducks,”
replied Mullins. A puzzled moment, then
the other piped up, “And how are we to
make Clucky understand we want
chickens and not ducks?”

“Jayem”: We had taken shelter in
Murphy’s pub during a violent thunder-
storm. Following a vivid flash of forked
lightning there came a loud crash as a
big tree, struck on the side of the hill,
toppled down. “Funny thing,” said
Murphy, “I often wonder why it is that
lightning doesn’t strike twice in the same
place.” “That’s simple,” said Long
Flarry, who’d been sampling bottle light-
ning all the afternoon ; “after it hits once
the same place ain’t there any more.”

“West Boulder”: Fuse is an implement
which the miner ever regards with suspi-
cion, but for which he is unable to find
an absolutely dependable substitute. Most
non-miners ask why he doesn’t use the
electrical detonator. The catch is that
in mining a number of charges usually
have to be fired within a very short time
but not simultaneously. When driving a
tunnel in hard rock a V-shaped “cut”
must first be taken out of the centre of
the “face,” where resistance is least. This
is done by drilling a line of holes
obliquely downwards so that their ends,
6ft. in, are about level with the least-
resistance point. Sometimes a matching
set is drilled upwards almost to meet them,
three holes to each series being usual. A
further three holes are then put in nearly
level with the floor, and a further three
up near the roof or “back.” In firing
out, the whole nine or 12 holes are
charged, but the ones in the cut must
explode first, taking out a big centre
chop. This eases the pressure on the
other holes, enabling them to tear the
“face” right out. After the “cut” the
bottom holes do their work, then the top
or “back” holes. The miner achieves this
time series by cutting his fuses to the
necessary lengths, the “back” fuses natu-
rally being the longest. It is an intense
couple of minutes as he listens to the
succession of thuds that spell each explo-
sion, and a horrible disappointment when
a short tally indicates a charge missed
fire. It is in going back to the “face”
after such short count that the miner
really takes his life in his hands.
WHEN WAR IS DONE.
When war is done
We’ll take our measure of the peace that’s won,
And life will yield a treasure more than gold
Of books, and quiet, and friends as we grow
old.
Sometimes, dear heart.
We’ll go to places where great choirs are,
And on imperious song we’ll travel far.
(For all their art
I’ll whisper to you softly while they sing
And touch your hand while rising for “The
King.”)
I think we’ll build
That hand-wrought house we talked of, dis-
tantly,
And from its cliff look eastwards to the sea.
It will be filled
With dreaming, and with deeds that rise from
dreams
And music out of Memory’s many streams.
We’ll climb again
That little hill we loved near Coogee Bay
And watch a merry wind blow in the spray.
And when the rain
Comes down at dusk upon a star-edged tree,
We’ll shut out all the world save you and me.
So, tenderly, we’ll wait the setting sun
When war is done.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Sydney Beef Show.
“Bulago”; It needed no war-time
excuse for quality or numbers. There
were cattle from Vic., S.A., Queensland
and N.S.W, Several studs were not up
to the usual standard of preparation
owing to labor shortage and drought.
The show was on a wool display floor,
lighting and accommodation excellent.
Most well-known Shorthorn studs were
represented and the Coonong cattle stood
out. The progeny of Calrossie Red
Baronet upheld his reputation. Others
by Red Baronet bulls proved the value
of the strain. Out of 18 Shorthorn
classes, Coonongs won two open and
two junior championships, two reserves,
ten firsts and eight other ribbons.
The champion, Coonong Keyman, is
a dark roan two-year-old of great scale,
beautifully proportioned, with a wonder-
ful underline. Coonong Kiltie, junior
champion, a rich red, aristocratically bred
young bull, and Jean Jealousy, heifer
junior and open champion, are good
beasts. The Coombing, Antrim, Woomar-
gama, Hambledon, Calool and Peel River
cattle deserved the ribbons they gained.
Calool won junior and open reserve
heifer prize.
Poll Shorthorns sustained the improve-
ment the breed has shown in recent years.
Netherby (Q.), Antrim and Gundibri had
some excellent cattle. Noteworthy was
the all-round improvement in colors.
Herefords turned out some very strong
classes, although there was a pronounced
tail in some. Golf Hill (Vic.) had
several bulls unbeatable in their classes,
but the females were not so good. Both
junior champion bulls came from Golf
Hill. Call Boy’s age debarred him from
the open championship, but Golf Hill
Resolute went on to win it from another
Resolute, bred by Fenwick Bros. Thus was
seen the anomaly of a reserve bull win-
ning the grand championship. Windsor,
Bexley, Colly Creek, Bective and Fern
Hill won ribbons. The Myall Creek
females were a particularly good team.
Only two breeders snowed Polled
Herefords. J. H. Doyle, of Merawah,
won in every class. Competition in
Devons was better, but Havilah cattle
held their lead. Table Top and Aubyn
studs won several ribbons. The young
Table Top junior champion bull shows
great promise.
The Aberdeen-Angus support was
strong and wide, and competition in the
bull classes keen as mustard. Clifford
Minter’s Kahlua females swept the board
and bulls from the same stud won after
close judging. Kahlua Tania, a beauti-
fully-proportioned, typical A.-A. heifer,
collected junior and grand champion
ribbons. Kahlua Warrigal beat Booroo-
mooka Jacobite for the bull champion-
ship by a very narrow margin. Narran-
gullen was back; so was Cavap ; and
Abington entries included Gaffer Evor-
don (imp.), sire of many prize-winners.
The Aberdeen-Angus section was full
of quality and style. In several classes
the judge had his work cut out to sepa-
rate them.
Long Tailing Lambs.
“Bungaree”; Fresh C.S.I.R, evidence
indicates that longer tails are definitely
beneficial against the fly. When the
4in. tail was first suggested some con-
tended that it would be better to leave
the tail untouched. This point was taken
into consideration by the C.5.1.R., and
a flock of long tails was included in the
experiments. Results show that though
the long tail is preferable to a very short
tail it still does not give the same pro-
tection as a 4in. tail; further, long-
tailed sheep are more susceptible to tail-
strike and their tails soil the fleece, par-
ticularly about the hocks.
Observations on whether the 4in. tail
caused more dags were made. During
the experiments the weather was too dry
for conclusive results, but figures show
that only wethers were affected, and of
these a larger percentage of the short-
tailed group required dagging than of the
long-tailed. This experiment is being
continued.
The percentage of strikes in the four
groups during the six months January-
July, 1941, were: Long tails, 24.8;
“If we ’ ave t' fall back , we’re doin’ what the Russians did—blow the
dam up."
medium tails, 60.9 ; short tails, 90.4 ; un-
docked tails, 41.3.
Another criticism levelled at the long
tails was that they would reduce lambing
percentages. Figures over three years
show that this is not so.
”
Drenches in Licks,
“J.R.D.”: An experiment by the
C.S.I.R. to test the results of administer-
ing phenothiazine to sheep in (a) a
mineral lick and ( b ) supplementary feed
showed that the small daily amount taken
up with the lick had a limited effect on
worm parasites. Some sheep ate more
than others, but, apart from this, the
small quantities were insufficient to do
more than affect the worm eggs passed
out and had only a light effect on the
worms themselves.
When administered as a drench in the
recommended doses phenothiazine is
highly efficient against large stomach,
black scour and nodule worms. When
taken up voluntary in a lick, fair results
were obtained against large stomach
worms, but the effect on nodule worms
was ncd s 0 go od. Comparatively poor
results were obtained against black scour
worms.
In six days the average amount of the
drug taken up in lick amounted normally
to about two-thirds of one full dose
per sheep. When incorporated in feed
it was again found that some animals
took more than was required while others
did not receive enough. The hungrier
animals were usually those in better
health, so the value of the drench was
lost. The net result proves that adminis-
tering phenothiazine by means of a lick
or feed is uneconomical and the only
satisfactory way at present known is as
a drench.
Lucerne for Pigs.
“H.C.”: There’s more profit in pigs
when home-grown crops are used. Best
of them is lucerne. High in protein, it
balances the carbohydrates of grains and
has the mineral content for body-build-
ing.
Grazed or cut, lucerne gives good
results provided grain is included in the
ration in the proportion of 21b. to every
1001 b. liveweight for growing pigs ; dry
brood stock should get slightly less.
Lucerne should be so managed that a
cut may be made periodically and cured
and stored as hay. It can be fed from
a rack, chaffed or soaked in boiling water
and mixed with other feeds.
To avoid lucerne taint in the pig meat,
delete it from the ration of baconers and
porkers about four to six weeks before
slaughter. Otherwise carcass quality
may be affected. Danger of lucerne
taint is lessened when there’s milk in
the ration.
n . <• p-
xseet to rigs.
Crescent ’; A Maoriland test of
sugar-beet fed to weaners showed that
the crop has its points. Eight weaners
by a Large White boar from a crossbred
sow were fed in a pen with practically
no running out for 56 days. They aver-
aged 281 b. weight at the start and 781 b.
at the finish.
This, says M. J. Scott, a pig industry
superintendent, is a carcass increase of
331 b., which at 6id. a pound means
17s, lid. per pig. The feeds used in the
period were 38 gallons of milk, 281 b. of
copra, 101 b, of maize and 2451 b. of sugar-
beet, total cost per pig being 4s. Bd. The
difference between this and the value of
the carcass increase, viz., 13s. 3d„ shows
a return of 4s. 2d. per gallon of milk
used. For every pound Sf carcass gain
The pigs grew at the rate of 0.91 b. a day.
• P oin l? 9 ut ’ ie ration was fed
Vt e . m 2ft efficient manner possible,
which is the main reason for the high
return per gallon of milk. But it shows
that when half the feed given is of high-
concentrate quality growing pigs do very
well on sugar-beet and the beet can show
as high a food value as is claimed for it.
Later, the pigs got skim-milk and
copra and put on 971 b. in 91 days. In
calculating the return for skim-milk,
sugar-beet was costed at ss. a ton. If the
skim-milk be costed at per gallon
instead, and the difference between feed
costs and value of carcass gain credited
to sugar-beet, the beet has a value of
£4 2s. a ton, about four times its usual
value.
Money in Onions.
“Teapot Flat”; N. S. Wales has never
grown nearly enough onions for her own
requirements, though she has the land
to do it. Now, with onions almost as
important to fighting men as their socks,
anybody who has irrigation or a reliable
spring and summer rainfall can turn to
the Spanish fruit with profit.
Early and mid-season varieties should
do well, even on the coast, though there’s
a risk of downy mildew there. Early
White Barletta, White Queen and Early
Grano are varieties that come in when
others are out, and there need be no
limit of the area given to them. Seed
should be sown at once.
The mid-season Hunter River Brown,
H.R, White and Maitland White can
be sown in April. Between then and
July is the time for the late types —
Sweet Spanish Valencia, Prizetaker, White
Imperial and the long-keeping Brown
Spanish. The last suits the tablelands,
and on the irrigation area and about
Maitland good money has been made
with Prizetaker and Sweet Spanish
Valencia crops sown in July. Don’t sow
in July if your district is liable to fogs
or heavy dews at the ripening period or
the onions won’t cure properly.
If you can get seed bulbs of the Early
Barletta type, sow them for seed. There
is a shortage of it, and contracts can
be had for whatever you produce at
17s. 6d. a pound. Onion
seed is easy to grow and
not costly to harvest.
Plant the bulbs 18in.
apart in furrows 4in. to
Sin. deep and 2ft. 6in. to
3ft. apart. Cover them
with about Sin. of soil.
Mix superphosphate with
the soil before planting
at the rate of 3cwt. an
acre. Never plant two
varieties close together—
onions cross as readily
as sheep. Given reason-
able luck you ought to
get between 1001 b. and
2001 b. of seed an acre.
Save the Beans.
“Five Blue”; The bean fly is small,
shiny and black. It lays eggs on the
upper sides of the bean leaves ; the grubs
hatch and burrow down through the
leaves into the stems. Given cool autumn
weather the eggs will hatch in four to
seven days, and there is a larval period
of three to four weeks. Even one fly to
every six plants would mean heavy
damage. About ten days after severe
attack the plants turn yellow and within
a fortnight will begin to topple and die.
The spray mixture is 1 fl. oz. of nicotine
sulphate, 6j fl. oz. of white oil emulsion
and 4gal, of water. The first applica-
tion should be when the plants are not
more than three days old, a second
spraying three days after the first and
subsequent ones every four days. Beans
sown in late March may need up to six
sprayings, those sown in April from two
to four.
Remember that the spray doesn’t
affect grubs that have got into the leaf
stems of the stalks. That’s why it is
important to keep the spray going to
beat the new eggs and larvae. A lapse
of a day in the programme may cause
heavy loss.

oil. If not relieved in an hour give him
a dessertspoonful of ground ginger in a
pint of warm water. Rub mustard, pre-
pared as for table use, on the horse s
belly for five minutes. Give copious
enemas of warm soapy water every hour.
Don’t allow the horse to feed until
several hours after the pain has subsided.
“Valerin”: Washing out with a weak
solution of Condy’s and warm water will
protect working horses from eye cancer.
Caused by flies and dust, it starts on the
third eyelid and appears as a warty
growth which bleeds freely. If neglected
it spreads and sets up “weeping” and
further fly irritation. In early stages cut-
ting out the growth generally effects a
cure. In advanced stages use the rifle.
“W. Court”: To grow large carrots
dig holes with a crowbar 12in. apart in
scrubland and fill ’em up with old horse
manure and wood ashes. Plant two seeds
in each hole; weed out the weaker seed-
ling.
“Plane Creek”; Dry your own tomato
seed by taking sound ripe tomatoes from
healthy plants and squeezing them to a
pulp in a vessel of water. Allow to
stand until the tomato seeds separate
from the pulp and sink to the bottom.
Then drain off the water and pulp and
dry the seeds in the sun.
“Sailor Bill”: Land on which trees
have been felled and burned is particu-
larly good for sweet and English pota-
toes, swede turnips, pumpkins, etc. Spread
the ash before ploughing. Don’t add too
much horse manure or nitrogenous fer-
tilisers to burnt-over land intended for
producing such crops.
“Bundalinga”: Try wheat coffee.
Roast the grains until they brown with-
out burning and then grind them to the
fineness of coffee. Pour boiling water
on the grounds, allow to draw for a few
minutes, add a pinch of salt. For a dif-
ferent flavor add a drop of vanilla for
each cup served, with sugar and milk
to taste.
“Canbelego”: Casino (N.S.W.) Co-op.
Dairy Society called tenders for excavat-
ing pit silos on farms of suppliers. A
clause provided that the contractor must
receive a clearance from the farmer stat-
ing that the work had been well done.
The society then paid the contractor and
gave the farmer time to make repayment.
The scheme was successful and exten-
sions are planned.
“B.”: A good ration for the working
draught is 181 b. of wheaten chaff, 91b.
of oats and 31b, of bran —41b. to 51b.
of chaffed lucerne can replace the bran.
Light horses on active work require 111 b.
of wheaten chaff, 91b. of oats and lib.
of bran. Both draught and light horses
should get 31b. to 51b. of hay at night.
Where oaten chaff is substituted for
wheaten, less grain is needed.

THE CONCRETE PATH.
Every time it rained heavily the path
from the kitchen to the laundry and
thence to the clothesline used to become
a miniature swamp. When that happened
Mother used to put a pair of Father’s
boots on, tie her skirt up with binder
twine and paddle back and forth with
pegs in her mouth and a distracted look
on her face.
She complained about it once, after a
particularly heavy rain, and our father
thought about it all one day and half
the next and then called us boys, pulled
up the clotheslines and re-erected them
at right angles to their former direction.
This might have worked for a year or
two, but a dry spell and Mother’s feet
soon flattened out the grass along the
new lines and then broke through the
ground crust. This doesn’t mean Mother
was a battle-cruiser or had big feet, but
even a fairy constantly running about on
the same track in a dry spell will wear
a path. You go and watch a line of
meat-ants—they’re light enough.
Well, when the rain broke the dry
spell the new clotheslines swung above
a yellow slurry of mud and water. Even
that might have passed, but that the
heavy sheets and things pulled one post
down and half Mother’s wash collapsed
into the slurry. She looked at it for a
long minute, then went inside, made her-
self a cup of tea, changed from her laun-
dry gear into a house dress and sat down
to wait for Father.
He could see there was something up
as soon as he sighted her. She put one
hand on his shoulder and said in a prim
little voice, “There’s something you ought
to see, dear,” Then she led him on to
the back verandah and pointed mutely
to the stained heap of articles lying in
the slurry. Father followed her back
into the kitchen, where she gave him a
cup of tea and a pamphlet.
The pamphlet told its readers, among
other things, how to make concrete paths,
and pointed out that the average farm
contained the ingredients except the
cement. After Father had had his cup
of tea and a fair look at the pamphlet
Mother said, “Nobody can say I’m hard
to get on with, but until there’s a con-
crete path under those lines I’ll never
wash another thing.”
She didn’t mean it as literally as that,
of course, but Father thought she did.
Next day he set our brother and me to
sieving gravel down on the creek while
he set off in the wagon to the sandhills
behind Tom’s Hump. We spent a week
building up a heap of gravel and sand,
and by that time the cement Father sent
for had arrived.
Then we got a lot of 3-by-l boards
and cut pegs and measured out the paths
and ran string from point to point. Our
brother went over and borrowed the
Thomsons’ spirit-level, and Father went
to town and brought home trowels and
a straight-edge. Then we cleared the
paths and dug out about two inches of
soil and levelled off the bottom of
the wide and shallow trenches. After
that we pegged the boards along the
sides and started to mix the concrete.
Then our brother and I poured the
wet concrete into the moulds and our
father levelled it off. The dogs, which
had taken great interest in our activities,
hopped in and paddled in the concrete,
and when Father made a swipe at
Boozer, our cattle-dog, he overbalanced
and left a pretty good design of himself
on the wet portion of the path. We
cleaned him off and tied all the dogs up
and levelled off the place where Father
had fallen in, and by that time it was
dark and we knocked off.
We had a lot of trouble with that con-
crete. It didn’t seem to dry, so that when
you thought a bit was right and stepped
on it bits of gravel and cement squelched
up round your boot and you had to jump
quick to dodge Father’s boot. Father
tried a different mixture, but then the
stuff dried rapidly and cracked and you
could pick flakes of it up. Father con-
sulted the pamphlet, but it didn’t say
much about that phase of the process.
On the third night old Poley, the house
cow, somehow got into the backyard and
decided the concrete path was as good a
place as any to sleep. Next morning we
had to chip the path away to get her up
and keep her in a sling for most of the
day before she got the strength back in
her limbs.
It was obvious that we weren’t making
a success of it, and Father told Mother
it might be better if we laid slabs of tim-
ber down instead. Mother “got that
look” on her face and Father changed
the subject. Then our brother said he’d
seen an advertisement somewhere for a
quick-drying cement and he remembered
the address was “222 Triple-street” in
the city. He remembered it because of
the twos and the triple, he said. So
Father took a chance and wired to the
address, “Can you ship five pounds’ worth
quick-drying cement?” Back came the
reply, “Yes. Tonight’s train. C.0.D.” So
Father was very pleased and wired for
them to do it.
Next morning he took the lorry and
went into town. He came back with a
very black look and called our brother
and gave him a cardboard box and said,
“I’ll keep the fiver out of your allow-
ance.” In the box were 100 tubes of stuff
to stick broken crockery and things like
that together and a receipt from the
stationmaster for the amount; “100 tubes
Quickstix Rapid Cement @ Is. —£5.”
We all went out and looked morosely
at the unfinished path, and then Father
went into the telephone and began talk-
ing to a man in the town who went round
making paths and building houses and
things.

(1) Particulars of the magnetic mine? (2)
How was it dealt with?
(1) On November 22, 1939, a magnetic mine
turned up on a sandbank at Shoeburyness and
a party of experts from H.M.S. Vernon, under
Lt.-Com. J. G. D. Ouvry secured it. Ouvry
dissected the mine and rendered it harmless;
it weighed about three-quarters of a ton and
contained a 7001 b. explosive charge of nitro-
glycerine. The firing device was a delicate mag-
netic needle which, when deflected by the mag-
netism of a ship’s hull, completed an electric
circuit and fired the charge. A separate firing
device was operated only if it dropped on some-
thing hard, like the deck of a ship. As the
magnetic mine was a ground mine it was effec-
tive only if the ship passing over it were within
the destructive area of its explosion, and it
would be useless in 50 fathoms of water 01-
more. (2) The object of the magnetic mine was
defeated by the “degaussing apparatus”—Karl
Friedrich Gauss was a German mathematician
and pioneer in electrical research —which con-
sisted of an ordinary insulated electric cable
fitted like a girdle around the hull. The girdle,
when energised in a special way by an electric
current, neutralised the natural magnetic field
of a steel ship and rendered her as safe from the
magnetic mine as if she were built of wood.

I am interested in an extensive terrace of fine
river wash which averages just over half a
pennyweight of gold to the yard. What is the
most effective dry process for recovering the
gold? There is no water available for washing.
As there is no water, the best method of
recovering some of the gold would be dry-
blowing. The wash must be quite dry and
free from clay and cement; coarse material is
removed by screening, leaving the gold in the
fine sand. The sand is then blown away from
the gold with a dryblowing machine. A good
dryblower, working under favorable conditions,
would handle eight to ten cubic yards in eight
hours, and would recover 50 to 60 p.c. of
the total gold in the wash.

A few hints on selecting and training a sheep-
dog ?
Be sure that the strain he is bred from has
produced natural and consistent workers, and
that the pup is lively and vigorous. He should
have a keen eye and be broad between the
ears, with a deep, broad chest. Complete con-
trol is the foundation on which his career will
depend. He must be taught to act immediately
the command is given—taught to come when
called, to “come behind” and to “sit.” All
that, not by bullying him or dulling his senses
by too much repetition, but by clear instruc-
tions. Encourage him, be patient and avoid
tiring him. He will take his first few lessons
with sheep by working with a broken-in dog;
overlook his first mistakes —corrections will only
confuse him for a start —but later it will be
necessary to correct any mistakes which might
become fixed habits. Biting sheep should, of
course, be checked immediately. Always remem-
ber that the breaking-in is a very bewildering
business for the dog. At four months a pup
should be given his grounding in control, and
at six months short lessons with sheep, although
he cannot work hard or travel long distances.

When exactly did the present European war
commence and when did England and France
come into it?
It commenced at 5.30 a.m. on Friday, Sep-
tember 1, 1939, when German troops invaded
Poland. Great Britain declared war on Ger-
many on the following Sunday, September 3,
a state of war having been declared to exist
from 11 a.m., British summer time, because of
the failure of the German Government to reply
by that hour to a demarche from the British
Government. At 5 p.m. on the same day, after
the expiration of the time limit set in a French
ultimatum to Germany, the French Government
officially announced the existence of a state of
war between France and Germany.

Recipe for a rat poison that is not danger-
ous to leave around where children might pick
it up ?
Mix eight ounces of barium carbonate, 17
ounces of flour and six ounces of pollard; stir
in five ounces of melted tallow, then add slowly
an ounce of salt dissolved in half a pint of
water. The result should be a stiff dough which
is rolled out to the thickness of about half
an inch, cut into half-inch cubes and baked in
the oven until dry. Spray the cubes with 10
drops of oil of aniseed mixed with eggeup of
water. They are then ready for distribution,
but should be handled as little as possible, and
then only after the hands have been coated
with aniseed oil to obliterate the human scent.
About one-fifth of a cube should kill a rat.

A simple way to bend metal pipes so that
they don’t flatten at the bend ?
Plug one end of the pipe with a tapered
wooden plug and pour into it some clean dry
sand. Tap the pipe lightly to settle the sand
and fill to within an inch of the top. Then
make a dozen or more thin softwood wedges
about six inches long and drive them about
four inches into the open end of the pipe until
it is completely blocked. The piping is then
to all intents solid, and may be heated and
bent to the desired angle like ordinary bar-
iron. Damp or wet sand, when heated, will
either burst the pipe or blow out the plugs.

(1) What examination is necessary to become
an umpire in N.S.W. Cricket Association?
(2) Chief duties of umpires?

M.C.C. Laws of Cricket; a sample of the ex-
amination is printed in the N.S.W.C.A. Year-
Book, 1939-40, price 6d. (2) The umpires are
the sole judges of fair and unfair play, of the
fitness of the ground, the weather and the light
for play; all disputes shall be determined by
them, and if they disagree the actual state of
things shall continue. They must be on the
ground 30 minutes before the commencement of
play and see that the wickets, bats and balls are
in accordance with the laws of the game (using
tapes and gauges if necessary) and must agree
between themselves, before play, what watch or
clock they will follow in deciding intervals and
close of play.

off clear liquid and discard sediment.' Soak
canvas in solution and move, about until
thoroughly wet, then squeeze but do not wring;
partly dry, repeat dipping, squeeze out again and
dry.

Treatment for (1) “damping” blooms and
(2) black aphis on chrysanthemums ?
(1) Trouble is caused by over-moisture and
accelerated by heavy autumn dews. Firm the
soil about the stems and reduce watering to
not more than twice a week; also remove leaves
and florets on the lower limbs and blooms
affected with brown spots. In foggy weather it
will save the blooms if the plants are covered
at night with hessian or paper, lifting it be-
fore sunrise. (2) Spray with Black Leaf 40
(trade strength) or dust with derris-root powder
in the early morning. Be careful when treating
the light-shaded blooms to minimise discolora-
tion. Three applications with four-day inter-
vals will clean up the pest.

How can I get rid of zamia palms ?
There are two methods: (1) Cut the palm off
at the ground and make a hole in the centre
of the stump. It should then rot away when wet
weather arrives. (2) Pour a tablespoon of kero-
sene into the heart of the plant, just where the
leaves grow out of it, in hot weather. It should
be dead and dried up in a month.

What is (1) the sugar production of Australia,
and (2) consumption ?
(1) Figures are for 1938-39, when 823,086
tons of raw sugar was produced from
5,678,984 tons of cane. (2) Average annual
consumption of raw sugar during the five years
ended 1938-39 was 359,872 tons, or 118.3711 b.
per head of population. That figure does not
include sugar used in making jams, preserved
fruit, milk, etc., which was as follows: Aerated
water and cordial factories 11,810 tons, bacon
factories 267, bakeries (including cakes and
pastry) 18,801, breweries 16,733, cereal foods
1287, condensed and concentrated milk 6747,
confectionery, ice-cream, etc., 26,926, jams,
jellies and preserved fruit 40,537. Particulars
of sugar used in some establishments are not
available, so figures quoted are deficient to that
extent.

tenance as it thinks fit shall be made out of
the estate of the deceased husband for such
widow... .M.M.G.: Insufficient information on
which to base an opinion. It may be that the
estate tail was barred in 1871, in which case
no claim exists by eldest living son. However,
if the estate is of some value, it might be worth
getting a solicitor to investigate and report on

A Trustee should administer your Estate to
the greatest advantage of your beneficiaries,
a task needing business wisdom, constant
devotion of time to the duties involved over
a considerable period, and sound technical
knowledge. He must be completely trust-
worthy. Should you find a friend possessing
all these qualifications and appoint him
Trustee—he may die before completing his
duties —age may sap his wisdom—misfortune
may befall him.
But should you nominate The Trustees
Executors and Agency Company Limited,
these circumstances cannot arise. Consti-
tuted under Act of Parliament, and answer-
able to the Courts, it is absolutely trustworthy.
It devotes its whole time and energy to the
administration of Trusts. It has the necessary
knowledge of the technicalities relating to
Trusts, is controlled by Directors of proved
capacity, and ... the Company “goes on
for ever”.

War has provided the Government with
an opportunity to embark upon a policy
of socialisation. This it has done by
means of its new economic plan, which,
according to Prime Minister Curtin, is
“simple economic justice.” Like all other
large-scale economic plans, the, basic
idea is an organised balance between
production and consumption, with the
price system as mediator. So practically
every aspect of economic life has been
subjected to State control in the matter
of policy, while individuals and corpora-
tions have been left free to manage their
own affairs in detail. In some aspects,
however, the “justice” of the Govern-
ment’s plans is too simple to be equitable,
as is made plain by the report of the
Joint Parliamentary Committee on prices
and profits.
Balanced production means priority
for the most urgently needed goods,
which, of course, are war goods ; then
essential goods for civil consumption, and
finally non-essential or luxury goods.
The last-named have been pushed so far
into the background that many are
already out of the picture. Chief con-
trols by which the Government seeks to
attain these ends are a network of regu-
lations governing the investment of capi-
tal, the volume of credit, the quantity
and direction of spending and the level
of prices, interest and rents.
One of the principal instruments of
control is the banks, which are subject to
wider and more rigorous restrictions than
other traders. Banking can now be car-
ried on only under license, which can be
withdrawn if the holder is found by a
High Court Judge to have “persistently
and wilfully contravened the regula-
tions.” Also, in making advances the
trading banks are obliged to follow the
policy laid down by the Commonwealth
Bank —a development which had already
taken place. The big change in banking
technique introduced by the regulations
is prohibition of purchase of Govern-
ment, semi-Government or municipal
loans or securities listed on ’Change by
the trading banks without consent of
the Commonwealth Bank. Instead, a
trading bank’s surplus investible funds
—the amount by which its total assets in
Australia exceed the average value of total
assets for the month of August, 1939 —or
such part thereof as the Commonwealth
Bank demands, are to be lodged with the
central bank, and cannot be withdrawn
without permission of that institution.
Interest will be paid on funds so deposited
at a rate designed to ensure that trading
profits of a trading bank shall not exceed
the average of its annual trading profits
for the three years ended Aug. 31, 1939.
Other regulations relate chiefly to pub-
lication of accounts and statements and
investigation of books, etc., by the
Auditor-General, and now closing of over-
lapping suburban and country branches.
It all means that the trading banks are
now little more than handmaidens to
the Government-controlled central bank,
having been shorn of their power to influ-
ence monetary policy effectively by
market operations, while their earning
capacity is tethered by statute.
The E., S. and A.’s declared trading
profits for the three years to the close of
accounts in 1939 averaged 8.6 p.c. on its
£3,000,000 of share capital. For the 12
months covered by the latest accounts
the net return was 6.9 p.c. on capital.
On shareholders’ funds (capital and re-
serves combined) the year’s profit was
only 3.1 p.c. So the £1,872,966 of deben-
ture stock, which is costing on the aver-
age a little over 3{- p.c., isn’t much of a
help to shareholders, nor is it likely to
be. The div. was kept at a nominal 7 p.c.,
which is worth 5.8 p.c. in Australian
after allowing for English income tax,
less relief in respect of Federal tax, and
for exchange at the current rate.

A growth of £3,028,951 in current
accounts and of £427,989 in fixed deposits
was accompanied by shrinkage of
£1,694,755 in advances and an expan-
sion of £5,699,854 in liquids. It all
reflects heavy Government spending and
tightening of lending except for essential
war purposes. Since the close of accounts,
part of the liquids will have passed into
custody of the Commonwealth Bank as
surplus investible funds. Overdraft
charges have also been restricted to a
maximum 5 p.c., but there has been an-
other all-round i p.c, reduction in the
rates paid for deposits. The co. is in
a strong position, and depositors have
nothing to worry about in the new regu-
lations.

The change in ord.-holders’ prospects
came two or three years back, when
Queensland electrical undertakings were
placed under control of a commission of
four, which is the price-fixing authority
for current, and City Electric’s ord. div.
was restricted, “as fair and reasonable,”
to a figure 2 p.c. above the rate carried
by Commonwealth loans offered for
voluntary subscription in the previous
year —pref. rights (there is £145,000 of
that class of capital) weren’t interfered
with. At the same time the Crown was
given the right of purchase, from 1954,
on a basis that will return around
£250,000 more than the net value of the
undertaking as shown in the books from
time to time.
At the same time the co. was made
the co-ordinating factor of a scheme
which aimed at centring and extending
the supply of electric current over the
s.-e. portion of the State from Gympie
in the north to the N.S.W. border —a
long franchise for the Tweed is also
held. Something of the ground covered
stands out in these figures;

In three years the book value of the un-
dertaking has grown by £1,596,218, of
which £459,517 was in respect of the
year under review. At the same time
£539,119 has been added to capital—
£l72,ooo in exchange for assets acquired,
the rest cash subscriptions, a method of
finance now of the past —cash tapped
for £218,714, while in September the
public fell over itself to take up a
half-million 10-year debenture paper at
4i p.c. “The further needs of fresh capi-
tal for development to which the co. is
committed” are being considered.
Assisted by the Sugar State’s growing in-
dustrial effort, more juice than ever left
the co.’s powerhouses in the year to
January, but the growth in outgoings
outstripped the benefits to income. After
chalking against revenue £95,731 (up
£3958) earmarked for renewals, etc., and
an extra £7414 for taxation (£74,457)
they account for the interlined net addi-
tions to reserves—the visible result was
left £11,376 lighter at a level just suffi-
cient to cover pref. divs. and the statu-
tory 5i p.c. to the ords. That was after
capitalising debenture issue exes, of
£10,868.
Renewals, replacements and contin-
gencies account, drawn upon for £23,662
during the year, comprises £1,177,035 of
the reserves shown. The rest consists of
capital reserve £303,786, taxation £74,459,
reserve fund £4l,6lB—the whole less the
£117,742 at which purchase account and
other intangibles appear. The conglomer-
ation renders it difficult to get at the
co.’s permitted profit margin under Can-
berra’s new economic order.

National decentralisation and a tolerant
State taxgatherer have blessed South Aus.,
where 8.H.P., 1.C.1. and others in the
heavy industries have set up and reached
out of recent years, with an unemploy-
ment figure 1.8 p.c. of trade-union mem-
bership. With the ground early prepared,
industrial growth has lately prospered at
a rate unparalleled in other States; from
125 in August, 1940, the index of factory
employment had lifted to 188 at the end
of December last, and overtime and wage
adjustments have added to the corpulence
of payrolls.
All this kept the West End and Nathan
breweries working to capacity last term,
when competition offered by Lion,
Cooper’s and the new Springfield co. was
even less noticed than usual. The co.’s
most ambitious competitor, Walkerville
Co-op., was swallowed on terms mutually
beneficial to both parties in 1938. S.A.
Brew showed a book profit of £140,000
on the deal, which was immediately
trundled away to inner reserves. These
have also benefited by visible appropria-
tions aggregating £120,000 since 1935,
apart from ordinary allowances for de-
preciation, etc., which the past record
suggests haven’t been skimped.
This conservatism might easily be
missed in a glance at bare balance-sheet
figures, the feature of which is the length-
ening register of pubs:

These internal contingency provisions are
particularly important in these days of
4 p.c. profit intentions, because, in com-
puting “capital” under the War-time
(Company) Tax enactment, the “depre-
ciated value of assets as determined for
income-tax purposes” —not necessarily
those shown in the books of the company
—is taken as a base. So guesses at per-
mitted profit-earning after June 30 aren’t
worth much.
An efficient management gets its
accounts in shareholders’ hands within a
fortnight of ruling off the books. For the
decline of £11,703 in admitted earnings
shown in those for the year to Feb., the
Federal tax-collector appears the chief
culprit, though other costs share part of
the blame. On capital the £83,038 was
11.5 p.c., against 13.1, 13.5 and 15.2 p.c.
for the three years before. Div, stayed at
10 p.c., and internal shock-absorbers were
strengthened with the balance of earnings
and £9170 from the visible lay-by.
The Federal cut ordered in beer-drink-
ing will affect earnings to June 30; profit-
restrictions may then further lower their
level.

Sydney.
Colonial Petroleum Co., Ltd.
Colonial Petroleum Co., of Sydney,
is still selling shares, an inducement,
a Queensland correspondent says, being
assured participation in the product,
though there appears to be nothing co-
operative in the venture’s make-up. The
co. was interested in the possibilities of
oil-shales even before the war, and a
prospectus in Sept., 1939, offered 66,719
£1 shares for subscription ; 3281 had at
that time already been taken by the pub-
lic. There was a fully-paid share con-
sideration of £17,500 due for processes,
etc., the vendors being entitled to a
royalty of fd. per gallon on all crude
oil produced. Leases to be taken over
were at Murrurundi (N.S.W.), term 16
years, and rights to mine shale at Baerami
for 10 years, with power of extension for
a similar period, were bruited. But neither
extent nor analyses of either deposits or
terms of working were detailed in the
body of the prospectus. Using the Miller
process, which represents a “near
approach to 100 p.c. efficiency,” a
battery of eight two-ton continuous
retorts, handling 2688 tons weekly,
was expected to yield 215,040 gallons of
crude oil weekly—Bo gallons to the ton
—worth £504 net, or £25,040 per 50-week
year. But there was no classification of
expected costs or receipts. Also absent
were independent certifications of the
items and of proposed capital outlay—
£l6,ooo for retorts and £30,000 for
buildings, general equipment and refin-
ing plant, in the opinion of the co.’s
consulting engineers, D. Bruce Miller and
T. G. Stoddart. Altogether the prospectus
left out too much that should have been
included. Two of the directors hie from
Adelaide, and a concern called Baerami
Shale Oil and Petroleum Co., Ltd., of the
same city, figures on the share-register.
There is still uncertainty as to the
future of Westralian goldmining. A week
ago the Perth “West Australian” said
that, despite some initial secrecy and
even denials, it seemed clear beyond
doubt that an early contraction was con-
templated by the Federal Government in
order to provide man-power for the con-
struction of allied war works. Since
then Treasurer Chifley is reported to
have told a deputation of Westralian
Federal members headed by Senator
MacDonald that the cessation of gold-
mining and curtailment of wheat produc-
tion could easily mean that Westralia
would become a ghost State. Later
Senator Macdonald said Mr, Chifley had
assured the deputation that goldmining
in the West would not be curtailed, but
that the development of new finds would
be discouraged, adding that only sheer
necessity would force drastic action to
the detriment of goldmining communi-
ties. Westralia hopes that the Common-
wealth will concentrate any labor with-
drawn from its goldmines upon war
works in the State, and that an effort
will be made not to disperse the staffs of
individual mines more than necessary. It
is suggested that mineowners, with their
complement of engineers and surveyors,
should undertake war works with their
own staffs under military supervision, a
policy, where practicable, which would
make the best use of mineowners’ orga-
nisations for war purposes and preserve
them more or less intact for eventual re-
sumption of mining.

A Mines Department comment on
1941 developments in North Kalgurli
(W.A.): —
Kalgurli section.-— Main developments during
the year were continuation of exposures of ore
on the lower levels.
Croesus Proprietary. —Ore assaying sdwt. over
big widths was opened up for a length of
100 ft. at No. 10 level, about 400 ft. of driving
and stripping of ore of good average grade and
width was done at the 9 level, and good values
up to 28ft. wide were exposed for a length
of 300 ft. at the 7 level. At other points
100 ft. of driving opened up ore of fair value,
and 300 ft. of driving and 100 ft. of winzing
showed payable values over widths up to 35ft.
Broken ore reserves increased.
North Kalgurli. —Development on the East
lode series from 5 down to 8 levels disclosed
fair-value ore. A crosscut to a winze in the
adjoining Paringa mine exposed 48ft. of good
ore. This ore-body is probably the extension
of the Greenhill shoot. At 8 level (bottom of
the North Kalgurli shaft) the ore is rather
patchy, and the average grade a little lower
than that higher up. Diamond-drilling of this
deeper ground will be done from the 13, 14
and 15 horizons of the adjoining Kalgurli sec-
tion. From development and stoping in the
North Kalgurli section of the West and Union
Jack lodes a large quantity of ore was obtained.
Union Jack. —About 300 ft. of driving on the
5 level exposed fair values on what may be
the northern extension of the Kalgurli main
lode.

Loss of Malaya, the Indies and Thai-
land has cut off the United Nations from
62 p.c. of world tin production on the
basis of 1940 output. If the present Jap
threat to Burma, a “non-signatory” pro-
ducer of some 6500 tons of the white
metal annually, is taken into account, the
percentage rises to 64. It is on Belgian
Congo, Bolivian and Nigerian resources
that reliance must now be placed to sup-
plement existing stocks, which had been
built up, though unfortunately not to
the extent desired, by a 130 p.c. inter-
national quota for the 18 months to the
end of 1941. Here are old and the
recently-adopted new standard tonnages,
for what they are now worth, of signa-
tories to the late international control
scheme compared with actual production

To what extent the Congo and Bolivia,
both of which have been unable to pro-
duce recent quotas in full, may be able to
lengthen their effort is problematical.
The best bet for immediate increase is
probably Nigeria, which has been virtu-
ally given a blank cheque by Britain as
regards plant requirements, etc. But, even
more so than in Australia, the maximum
endeavor here isn’t likely to be put for-
ward until John Bull modifies his attitude
towards mining taxation, particularly in
respect of “excess” profits. The inter-
national events of recent months have
put an entirely different complexion on
the much-criticised decision of the U.S.
last year to establish a smelter to treat
Bolivian concentrates.

Energetic U.S. measures to replace the
rubber lost through the yellow man’s
successes in Malaya and the Indies en-
visage factories to produce 400,000 tons
of synthetics a year, against a capacity
of 90,000 tons at present in operation or
under construction. Authorised outlay
for the programme is 400 million dollars,
or roughly £lOO millions stg. Leading
rubber, oil and chemical companies are
said to be pooling their patents, scientific
and technical processes and other facili-
ties. The rubber deficiency in the U.S.
to be made up may be judged from the
fact that towards world rubber shipments
in normal times of some 1,400,000 tons
Malaya and the Dutch East Indies con-
tributed about 540,000 tons each, or
nearly 80 p.c. of the total, and other
countries —Ceylon, India, Borneo and
Sarawak, Thailand and French Indo-
China —some 260,000 tons. Consumption
in the U.S. is running at the rate of
roughly 800,000 tons a year. The acqui-
sition of a strategic stock reserve was
started in 1939, but owing to shipping
shortages and other things not more than
455,000 tons was visibly held at the be-
crinninrr IQ/11 c
g ng ,41 sufficient for rather
more than SIX months. It is considered,
however, that all American stocks and
rubber derivable from other sources, in-

manufacturing needs until the synthetic
programme is in full swing,

SUGAR.
At the adjourned annual meeting of the Australian
Sugar Producers Association, Ltd., the president
Thos. W. Crawford, said, inter alia: —
Production for the season of 1941 was
below that of the preceding years: this
was due in most cases to comparatively
unfavorable seasonal conditions, although
in the Burdekin area particularly,
approximately 110,000 tons of cane were
not harvested owing to the restriction of
the manufacture of sugar to the officially
gazetted quotas of each mill, this restric-
tion being brought about by the limit in
the quantity of sugar that was disposed
of to the Government of Great Britain.
Some cane was also left unharvested
in the Bundaberg district, but as it has
been the custom in this district to leave
cane as standover for the following
season, no unusual hardship would have
followed in ordinary circumstances. Un-
fortunately the circumstances in the Bun-
daberg district were not ordinary this
year. One of the heaviest floods ever
experienced occurred last month, and a
great deal of damage was done to the
standing crops, the farming lands and, in
the case of the Fairymead Sugar Com-
pany, to the mill surroundings and the
stored sugar. I take this opportunity of
tendering the sympathy of all sugar pro-
ducers to those who were affected by
these floods.
In the present circumstances very little
can be said of the prospects of the forth-
coming crop throughout Queensland,
beyond indicating that the crop is not
expected to reach as high a tonnage as
that of 1941 owing to unsatisfactory
seasonal conditions.
The time is now approaching when
growers will be considering their cam-
paign for the 1943 season, and, if condi-
tions outside their control permit, it
would appear that the land usually avail-
able should be utilised because it seems
almost certain that the tonnage harvested
per acre must decrease owing to the defi-
nite indication of the shortage of arti-
ficial fertilisers. The shortage of the
necessary labour will have to be taken
into consideration, particularly as a con-
tributing factor to this shortage is the
enlistment of the farmers and their sons
in all branches of the fighting forces of
the Commonwealth. However, to cope
with this shortage of labour steps are
already being taken in an endeavour to
co-ordinate the man-power of the Com-
monwealth so that the essential indus-
tries—and sugar is one of them—should
not fail in keeping up reasonable sup-
plies. Again, of course, this is all con-
tingent upon our effective man-power
not being called up to undertake a more
serious task.
As was only to be expected in the cir-
cumstances, great difficulty has been met
with in the transport and shipping of
our sugar, and at the present time a very
considerable tonnage is still in store. It is
quite impossible to make any forecast
a? to when final removals will be ac-
complished, because the programmes
laid down by the responsible authorities
are being constantly altered to suit what
are considered to be more urgent
demands in other requirements.
For obvious reasons too much cannot
be said on this subject, but you may rest
assured that the closest attention is being
given to it and those directly responsible
to you are in daily communication with
the authorities who have the final dis-
position of all means of transport.
Anticipation of the difficulties just
referred to necessitated a substantial in-
crease in the normal storage capacity of
the mills, and it is pleasing to put on
record that the Commonwealth Govern-
ment made a grant to all mills to help
cover the cost of the extra storage
erected. In many cases also the cane-
growers and millowners have come to
satisfactory arrangements whereby the
canegrowers bear some of the costs in
both the erection of the stores and the
handling of the extra quantity of sugar.
To meet this new position also special
arrangements for advance payments on
sugar were instituted by the Sugar Board
in lieu of the normal conditions of the
advance payment being made on the
sugar being shipped. The position in
this respect at the present date is that,
though a large quantity is still unshipped,
advance payments have been made on
all sugar manufactured, though of course
that which has been shipped has been
paid for at a higher rate.
Another new departure in respect of
the past season’s sugar production was,
in order to encourage earlier supplies, the
payment of a bonus on all sugar manu-
factured before a fixed date. This proved
to be an excellent procedure, as shipping
was more readily available in June of
last year, and early stocks were cleared :
if the mills had not acceded to the re-
quest for early sugar, there is no doubt
that there would be much more un-
shipped at the present time and in some
cases mills may have had to suspend
operations for lack of storage at the peak
of the season.
As regards the operations for the com-
ing season, you will have recently been
notified that the State Government has
issued its two formal and preparatory
proclamations under which it exercises
its powers of acquisition. As noted in the
official statement, the Queensland Gov-
ernment is bound under its agreement
with the Commonwealth Government to
acquire each year all the sugar manufac-
tured, and it then lies with the Queens-
land Government, by issuing a later pro-
clamation, to set out the terms and condi-
tions under which it has acquired the
sugar to be manufactured. It naturally
follows that on these terms and condi-
tions will depend the maximum quantity
that will be manufactured, as no mill-
owner can afford to manufacture any
sugar for which he is going to receive
what amounts to a negative price. The
crux of the position lies then in the
Proclamation that will be issued, prob-
ably, in May.
Report of the Committee of Inquiry
on Power Alcohol
The Committee delivered its Report in
June of last year and a summary of the
conclusions and recommendations was
published in the Sugar Journal of July
10, 1941. Briefly the results of the actual
recommendations and of subsequent
action have been, so far as the Queens-
land sugar industry was concerned, very
little different from what was being
planned prior to the appointment of the
Committee of Inquiry. The distilleries
now producing anhydrous alcohol from
molasses and sugar were all established,
and the additional capacity had been
provided for. A small quantity of sugar
has been absorbed by small distilleries in
the south which have been producing
what is known as “wet” alcohol —that is,
alcohol of 95-96 degrees strength; but,
generally speaking, the outstanding result
of the recommendations of the Com-
mittee has been the inclusion of wheat as
a raw material for alcohol, and the pend-
ing establishment of distilleries in the
Southern States. It is gratifying to know,
however, that, as a result of the Inquiry,
the benefits of power alcohol as a blend
for motor spirit were established in public
opinion and that the distilleries now
operating have been able to absorb quite
a considerable quantity of sugar as well
as all the molasses available.
World Sugar Situation
The position of sugar in the world
generally can only be referred to in very
general terms owing to the conditions
brought about by the war.
We know that Java and the Philip-
pines have been invaded, and naturally
there must have been destruction and
chaos. It is also to be expected that
the production of these countries will not
reach the markets of the Allied countries.
This factor will no doubt give some
encouragement to production of both
beet and cane sugar in the Allied coun-
tries, and particularly in those where
transport is the least subiect to enemy
interference.

Standard Oil and the Enemy
The claims made by a U.S. Senate
committee against the Standard Oil Co.
of New Jersey (once described as one of
the three or four best-organised institu-
tions of any kind in the world) are a
further page in the story of this tre-
mendous co.’s development of oil and
oil-producing processes. Standard entered
Germany as an oil distributor in 1890,
And it is known that Standard has
long had associations with the Ger-
man chemical (or dye) trust known as
I.G. Farbenindustrie, especially in con-
nection with the evolution of a number
of patents relating to the production of
synthetic petrol, rubber, toluol and other
essential war materials. Following the
perfection of the Bergius process of ex-
tracting petrol from coal —in 1927 an
experimental plant produced the stuff for
15 cents a gallon—in 1929 Standard gave
the German chemical trust a share in its
German oil market in exchange for world
rights to the patent outside of Germany.
The U.S. rights were retained by
Standard and other U.S. refiners, while
the international rights passed to a co.
owned jointly by Standard and Royal-
Dutch-Shell. These rights were modi-
fied soon after the outbreak of war
between Britain and Germany by the dis-
posal of all except British, American and
French rights. “The Lamp,” house
organ of Standard Oil, in the earlier
half of 1941 protested that “all exchange
of technical information with the I.G.
was suspended on the outbreak of the
European war,”
The Bergius process, Standard claimed,
originated with the Germans. And the
Germans are the only people who have
made extensive use of it. After the
outbreak of war Germany depended con-
siderably on hydrogenation plants for its
petrol, and almost all its rubber has been
synthetic—made from oil. The Bergius
patents were also exploited by Imperial
Chemical Industries at Billingham (Eng.),
and, it was claimed, provided Britain
with a “minimum assured supply of
gasoline.” But Standard’s interest in
obtaining control of the patents outside
of Germany was admitted to be partly
because their exploitation in ordinary
times might shut out flow-oil from oil-
importing countries. And Standard and
its associates are the world’s biggest pur-
veyors of flow-oil. They feared tariu-
subsidised competition from coal-oil in
countries that had no flow-oil.
The New York “Times” of June 9
last, relying on information taken from
“The Lamp,” put the position thus;
The Germans were planning to introduce
the process in Germany and were consiaei-
ing extending it to other countries, rear-
ing that this might shut out petroleum pro-
ducts from many countries by artificially
stimulating unsound and uneconomic nign
tariff policies on petroleum and its pro-
ducts, high tariffs being the only means by
which the difference between the prices ot
low-cost natural imports and high-cost
home synthetic production could be mao
up, the American concern gave the German
chemical trust in 1929 a share of its German
market in exchange for world rights, ex-
clusive of Germany, in the new process.
Out of this agreement developed the
present arrangement, in which United States
rights to the process are controlled by an
American corporation whose stock is heio
by 18 American oil refiners, and are exer-
cised by two Jersey plants and four others.
The international rights passed to a concern
owned jointly by Standard Oil and Royal-
Dutch-Shell, a Dutch concern with a large
British interest. These rights were modified
by the disposal of all except British, Ameri-
can and French rights soon after the outbreak
of war, and today the former headquarters
at The Hague is occupied by a German
commissar administering the affairs ot the
Standard-Dutch-Shell subsidiary, refusing to
recognise the transfer of its administration
to Curasao, Dutch West Indies.
“The Lamp” itself stated:
The progressive deterioration of interna-
tional relations over the last few years has
made our business contacts with Germany,
Japan and other countries of interest to
our State Department. We have made it a
practice voluntarily to inform the depart-
ment of all new developments which might
have a bearing on the national interest.
Following on these revelations and
claims of nine or ten months ago the
present U.S. Senate charges are interest-
ing, They concern the rubber patents.
U.S. Assistant Attorney-General Thurman
Arnold (who is Chief of the Anti-Trust
Division), commenting on letters passing
between Standard Oil and LG. Farben-
industrie, described the co.’s activities
as “a device for the continuation of a
conspiracy throughout the war.” There
were exchanges of information about the
manufacture of synthetic rubber, and
cartel arrangements as well. A letter
sent on Oct. 12, 1939, by Standard to the
German chemical trust stated; “We have
done our best to work out complete
plans for a modus vivendi which could
operate during the war, whether or not
the U.S.A. comes in.”
Mr. Arnold added that the cartel
arrangements with Germany were the
principal cause of the present shortage
of synthetic rubber. He said, however,
that these arrangements were not de-
signed to aid Germany, but to give
Standard Oil a protected market, to
eliminate independent competition, and
to restrict production in the world’s
markets to maintain control. Prior to
these Senate statements it was announced
that a judgment by consent had made
Standard Oil rubber patents free to any
manufacturer. Mr. Arnold said that
Standard Oil had developed a type of
synthetic rubber cheaper, better and
more plentiful than the Germans had yet
produced. Until the Court judgment they
had withheld the patents from general
use. He also alleged that Standard had
endeavored to make trading relationships
in Japan in anticipation of an outbreak
of war.
William S. Parish, president of Stand-
ard Oil, said that samples of synthetic
rubber put before the U.S. Government
in 1939 had been regarded as being of
doubtful quality. He denied any hin-
drance or delay to the production of
synthetic rubber in the United States.
“Any charges that Standard Oil or
any of its officers have been in the slight-
est respect disloyal to the United States
are unwarranted and untrue,” Parish
declared. “I repel all insinuations of
disloyalty with all the vigor at my com-
mand. Moreover, I wish to assert with
conviction that whether the several con-
tracts made with the German Dye Trust
did or did not fall within the borders
set by the patent statutes and the Sher-
man Anti-Trust Act they did contribute
greatly to the advance of American indus-
try and more than any other thing made
possible our present war activities in
aviation gasoline, toluol explosives and
synthetic rubber itself.” He later admitted
that in 1939 and 1940 his co. had taken
steps to prevent other U.S. concerns
developing synthetic rubber.
Mr. Parish added that Standard Oil
contracts made in 1929 were to run until
1947. In war, contracts were not abro-
gated but suspended, and therefore the
parties to them must find some way of
getting along while the contracts were
suspended. War broke out in 1939,
Standard Oil took over the German
rubber process, informed the War and
Navy Departments, and offered to co-
operate in speeding up the production of
synthetic rubber.
The fixed price for wool and the rising
level of production costs are disturbing
graziers. Wages in particular are going
up fast as living costs rise, and the
present Government’s financial policy is
aiding and abetting costs-inflation, how-
ever much it may protest to the contrary
and bludgeon anyone but its own section
in a desperate attempt to stop the rot.
The Labor party’s high-pressure sales-
manship of a platform that would
not work in peace-time is turning out an
even worse take-down in the country’s
present peril. Flashness and cocksureness
do not long hide ignorance and inability
to govern when realities crowd in on us
desperately fast. Australia is paying
for the pups it has been sold.
* ■* * *
Australia’s national debt stood at £1467
million on September 30, 1941. It was
then equal to £206 a head of the popula-
tion. Of the total debt, £261.6 million re-
presented 1914-18 war debt and £168.7
million was on account of the present
war. Total Commonwealth debt was
£551 million, while that of the States
was £916.7 million. States debt had
increased by £l9 million between June
30, 1939, and Sept. 30, 1941. The interest
bill on the total national debt was £5O
million p.a. as at Sept. 30. It had grown
£4 million a year since war started. Since
Sept. 30 public borrowings have added a
further £BO million or thereabouts to the
debt and about £2 million a year to in-
terest requirements. That is quite apart
from the big expansion in the sum of
Treasury bills discounted with the Com-
monwealth Bank. The Labor party has
had great recourse to bank credit as a
means of war finance, but it may pos-
sibly use some of the money oversub-
scribed in the last public borrowing
operation to retire portion of the Trea-
sury-bill debt. No such movement is yet
evident, however. It is now freely fore-
cast that the war will cost Australia £3OO
million this year instead of the £221.5
million mentioned in the Chifley Budget.
Some of the extra will be met by £2O-
- million of new taxes and perhaps a
few million by surplus taxes. Even so,
total Commonwealth borrowings during
the year to June 30 may exceed £l9O
million. It is far too big a figure con-
sidering the nature of the chief item of
expenditure.
* * * *
Following introduction of the 44-hour
week —it is impossible to work it eco-
nomically at sea —various seamen’s
unions have been granted war-risk
bonuses of 33| p.c. when in waters north
of Bundaberg or Fremantle and when
sailing between Australia and New Zea-
land or other overseas destinations. Sea-
men operating in Australian waters south
of Bundaberg and Fremantle will receive
a 20 p.c. bonus. The 44-hour week will
be made retrospective to January 2,1942,
which will mean that a large amount of
extra leave will have to be granted to the
men or a corresponding amount of over-
time paid. Seamen have been ordered
not to take on board a “firearm, knuckle-
duster, loaded cane, slingshot, bowie
knife or dagger.”
« * * *
The peculiar resentment that some
Australians display towards employers is
reserved mainly for the producer and
those who aid production. The publican
is never singled out as “an enemy of the
working class,” nor is the bookmaker.
The pawnbroker and the cash-order con-
cern are rarely criticised by Labor. But
let anyone start producing anything of
vital necessity, such as steel, gas, coal,
textiles, etc., or introduce necessary ser-
vices such as shipping and other forms
of transport and banking, in no time at
all Labor is at his throat. It is almost
as though Labor resents progress. A thin-
skinned type of Australian is noteworthy
for a dislike or distrust of people who
don’t talk or live exactly as he does.
His fundamental idea of democracy is
that everyone should be on equal speak-
ing terms. The rest of it to him is Dutch.
* * * *
Australian trade-union unemployment
for the last quarter of 1941 was down to
2.9 p.c., the lowest figure on record.
Money wages are also a record, being
higher than ever, and keeping in step
with the war-time inflation in living costs.
From Feb. 1 this year the average Com-
monwealth basic wage has been 88s.
Since the outbreak of war to the Decem-
ber quarter of 1941 “all items of house-
hold expenditure” as computed by the
Commonwealth Statistician had risen
12.2 p.c. Unemployment is lowest in
South Aus. and Westralia (1.8 p.c. each),
with Victoria following closely at 2.1 p.c.
Queensland has 3.8 p.c., N. S. Wales 5.5
p.c. and Tasmania 4.5 p.c.
V *
Maoriland Arbitration Court, which
recently turned down an application
based on similar grounds, has granted a
5 p.c. increase in general wage rates to
meet rising living costs. The order pro-
vides that from April 7 the lift shall
apply to all men’s wages up to £5 a week,
women’s up to £2 10s. and juniors up
to £1 10s. Workers receiving higher
rates will be allowed the 5 p.c. addition
to the base of their wage only.
v * *
The £200,000 debenture loan offered
by Metropolitan Gas, Melbourne, carry-
ing 3i p.c. for 15 years, was very much
undersubscribed. Only £81,700 was taken
by the public, the remainder being left
on the hands of the underwriters, J. B.
Were and Son. Apparently the people’s
preoccupation with the big war loan had
something to do with the poor response.
* * * *
Tobacco rationing remains on an un-
altered scale —average monthly sales for
the year to Sept. 30, 1940, less 25 p.c.

Although the McKell Government in
N. S. Wales has said that “no man in
the fighting services will face poverty
and hardship through taxation,” the fight-
ing forces are finding McKell no open-
handed benefactor. He has rocked in
double taxation on 1940-41 wages and
salary income, and his Taxation Depart-
ment is grabbing it with both hands from
service men even where they have now
been reduced to a bare army-pay income.
Where soldiers have money to pay drey
have to pay —only cases of “hardship, not
injustice, are being considered for pur-
poses of remission. The iniquity of the
thing shows up where a man was on a
good salary up to the end of 1940-41 and
then joined the army. He was taxed at
source in 1940-41 for N. S. Wales special
tax, and now, in 1941-42, he is being
taxed again at the rate applicable to his
1940-41 income, even though he may now
be on a private’s pay. By means of these
and other devices the McKell Govern-
ment looks like showing a surplus this
financial year. Rough justice could still
be done to all taxpayers by making the
assessment on 1940-41 income simpiy
an advance payment in respect of 1941-
42 tax. But that would involve a revela-
tion of the humbug attending the “aboli-
tion” of the U.R. tax.

Australia’s stocks are going up —in the
U.S.A. as well as in this country. The
fact that another week had passed with
no increase in aerial onslaughts, plus
more favorable reports about the posi-
tion in New Guinea, brought buyers
into the Wall-street market for Common-
wealth bonds at considerably firmer
prices. Industrial issues in Australia also
showed the first real sign of recovery
since the Stock Exchanges reopened.
Anyone with a credit bank balance and
not too much in the way of industrial
investments will find the present a good
ame to buy 8.H.P., Bradford Cotton,
breweries, Huddart Parker and other
shipping cos., and Barrier mines.

“Some idea of Canada’s tremendous
war effort may be gleaned from the fact
that in 1942 the shipping, both naval and
mercantile, that she will launch will be
almost equal to that from Britain’s more
experienced shipyards,” said High Com-
missioner Malcolm Macdonald last week.
War industries were employing 600,000
persons in the Dominion, and if the figure
rises to 700,000 this year it will represent
the maximum available man- and woman-
power. Canada has presented Britain
with a credit of $lOOO million, to be
taken out in Canadian food and muni-
tions. Britain has just about exhausted
its funds in the Americas.
* * *
The cost-of-living index in Canada on
December 1 was 14.9 p.c. above that of
August, 1939, the month prior to the out-
break of war. It was showing a small de-
cline in December last following the intro-
duction of a rigid price-control system.
This control was singularly effective, to
begin with at any rate, but most ob-
servers insist that it can only act as an
expedient pending more fundamental ad-
justments, among which rationing figures.

The panic buying of sugar in some
parts of the Commonwealth is about the
most senseless of all the hoarding stunts
that have occurred so far. During the
last war there certainly was a shortage
of sugar within Australia, and the price
of the imported Mauritius product soared
to an unheard-of level. But nowadays
the Commonwealth produces far more
raw sugar than it can possibly consume,
and there is every incentive to the pro-
ducer to sell in the protected local
market—apart from the fact that ex-
porting is a precarious occupation in any
case. The only thing likely to cause a
shortage of sugar in certain States is the
matter of transport. And that should be
only a temporary matter. Roughly 40
p.c. of Australia’s sugar production is
consumed within the country.
* * »
Though Queensland’s sugar crop for
1942 is expected to be lower than for
1941, owing to dry weather, it shouldn’t
be forgotten that Queensland’s output of
sugar in recent years has been particu-
larly high. Australian production was
743,000 tons in 1941 (lower admittedly
than in the two previous years); Austra-
lian consumption was 400,000 tons.

Opinion in the Federal Treasury is
“confident,” we have been told, that the
additional direct taxation decided on
after the Japanese entry into the war
will exceed £2O million, and that further
taxation of this kind will not be neces-
sary during the current financial year.
It is quite probable that the present
Government has found a large accumu-
lation of uncollected taxes from previous
years awaiting its call; up to June 30
last many taxpayers were still waiting
on assessments usually received about
February or March. The necessary
growth of Australia’s defence forces in
31 months or so has been a headache
to all who appreciate sound public
finance and economical administration ;
it has been extremely difficult to keep
either finance or administration under
effective control. Finance should be the
easier of the two, however, as policy can
be carried out by a financial organisation
that has worked at high pressure in peace-
time and should only need readjustment
to work on a war basis. The main thing
to watch out for is faulty policy to begin
with ; and a policy that does not visualise
taxation as the main source of war
finance is faulty to the point of danger,
The present Government seemed more
inclined towards the levying of “all-over”
taxation than it used to be until it sud-
denly started on its soak-industry-and-
kid-to-strikers programme. Though we
have heard that no more direct-taxation
levies are likely during 1941-42, the size
of our war effort and the financing of
it are not definite pictures as matters
stand. War expenditure has been much
greater than budgeted for during the first
nine months of the current term. It is
evident to some people that war expend!-
ture could be less than it is and yet be
quite as effective.

Old-age pension rates are to be lifted
to 255. a week, apparently as part of
the Canberra Government’s war effort,
Mr. Holloway, who is Minister for
Social Services, says it will be made
retrospective to April 2. Other “reforms”
are contemplated. This is the second rise
in pension rates since Labor assumed
office less than six months ago. The
party never overlooks the point that there
is more than a war to be won.
* * • *
Although the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, which is financing the vi var, has
honored its promise to make rebates to
those people whose combined rates of
income tax exceed 18s. in the £, the
States have failed to comply with the re-
quest to co-operate. The result is that
some people are being taxed at more
than 20s. in the £ Callous irresponsi-
bility like this on the part of the States
can only lead to one thing the aboli-
tion of State taxing authorities altogether.

THE SERVICE MAN
Australia at Battle Stations.
“Ek Dum”: General Blarney lost little
time after his return in laying down the
organisation of a battle force of a weight
which must make the Japanese pause
and think hard. He has been given what
looks like a commendably free hand,
subject to the supreme strategy of Gen-
eral MacArthur. Nominally, if he wishes
to take soldiers, apart from the A.1.F.,
one yard outside the three-mile limit, he
will have to shanghai them if they do
not go willingly ; but that political prohi-
bition will not stand.
The structure of the Australian defence
now seems to be built into two armies
of incalculable number (European armies
range round 100,000) and one —or two —
detached corps.
District divisions have been scrapped.
For the first time the Commonwealth
defence forces are arrayed in a front
battle-line formation awaiting the enemy.
They will, of course, be reinforced by
the heartening numbers of Uncle Sam's
soldiers and airmen who are to be seen
in the streets of Australian cities and
towns, some of them far-flung. The
whole makes an army group far more
formidable in numbers and strength than
the British expeditionary force which
went to France in 1939. The men of
the A.I.F. have come back tough and
battlewise, to provide a fine nucleus of
officers and training units for the whole ;
and they returned fully equipped.
The rest are not fully equipped by the
standards of Europe. By Japanese ex-
peditionary standards they are. It is be-
coming clearer that the Japanese are fac-
ing in a severer form the shipping prob-
lem of other belligerents. Their expedi-
tions are homoeopathic except in men,
who are easy to pack into ships in large
quantities for comparatively short
voyages. Their men also have been easy
to feed where rice is to be looted for
the asking and the sea is full of staple
Japanese diets.
But they have been short of large
quantities of intense artillery. They have
used light bombs. Their rifles are light
and of small calibre.
It would be a complacent promoter
who would be satisfied with an assay of
the Japanese effort in New Guinea.
The enemy will have to do much better
against this continent if he intends to
attack it. His effort will call for every
ship he has, and the list of Australian
commands so far issued shows that
wherever he makes his move —if he
does make one—it will be against leaders
with actual experience of modern war
and methods and whose fighting stand-
ards and man-power are superior to his
own.
They and their men will be fighting on
ground with which they are fully familiar
—the Japanese are not —and over long
distances to which the Japanese nature
is not accustomed. And if it should be
necessary at times to go short of water
the defenders will be able to stand it
much better than the invaders, to whom
thirst is strange.
The head and front of the Australian
Command is General Blarney. He has
never failed from the beginning of the
war to envisage the magnitude of the
struggle and the revolution which would
be caused by the advent of modern quick-
firing armament and fast transport. He
is not likely to underestimate his enemy.
In Libya and Greece he has added ex-
perience in command in the field to a
notable training as one of Monash’s best
staff men in the last war. As Deputy
Commander-in-Chief in the Middle East,
the air defence of Alexandria and other
large cities has been one of his special
pidgins. The subsidence of heavy air
attacks on those centres tells its own
story, despite the boo-boo boys who were
all for Mr. Heffron, sometime secretary
of the Marine Stewards’ Union, when the
matter was discussed during the general’s
visit to Australia last October and
November. Time will tell whether Heff-
ron’s cellophane and netting or Blarney’s
“couple of squadrons of fighters” will
save more lives per pound of expenditure
in Australian cities.
The Chief of the General Staff will be
Lieutenant-General Sturdee ; the deputy,
Major-General G. A. Vasey. Under the
C.-in-C., whose power is as absolute as
possible, are two army commanders.,
Generals Mackay and Lavarack. Mackay
led the 6th Division in the first Libyan
advance, and was in the Middle East long
enough to study the Syrian campaign, in
which Lavarack commanded all columns,
save one detached one in the eastern
desert. Mackay has been for several
months laying the foundations of the
defence of Eastern Australia, with com-
mand in five States.
Lavarack has been through or within
seeing distance of all the Middle Eastern
fighting. Like Blarney and Mackay, he
has had the advantage of contact with
General Wavell and his commanders and
is familiar with all the details and per-
sonalities of defence from here to
Cyrenaica. He was recently on General
Wavell’s staff in Java.
Mackay’s chief of staff will be a bril-
liant brigadier, C. E. M. Lloyd ; Lavarack
will have Major-General Berryman, an-
other veteran of the Middle Eastern war,
as his C.O.S.
The detached corps, whose headquarters
is the only one of which the position is
indicated, will be located at Perth (W.A.).
That it will be commanded by Gordon
Bennett, who has been promoted lieuten-
ant-general, is taken as a sure sign by the
flapper press that the main attack will be
on the west. Did the C. in C. believe
that, he would not be defending W.A.
with a detached corps centred on Perth.
Lieut.-General Douglas Wynter, whom
many people expected to become a
corps commander, takes over the im-
portant administrative H.Q. command.
Major-General H. C. Robertson be-
comes G.O.C. armored division, in place
of Major-General Northcott, who is pro-
moted to lieutenant-general and receives
command of a corps. Robertson learnt
his armored work in Libya. Brigadier
Steele is promoted major-general and
will be engineer-in-chief to the army.
Several seasoned officers, a large pro-
portion under 50, have been promoted
to divisional commands. Some went
away two years ago as lieutenant-
colonels.
Lieut.-General E. K. Smart, who has
been G.O.C. Southern Command, goes
to Washington as representative of the
Australian Army there.
The only criticism which could be
offered is of the plenitude of high-rank-
ing officers; but the matter must be
viewed in the light of the fact that Aus-
tralian officers of general’s rank are the
worst-paid in the world. Their earnings
are only half those of equivalent ranks
in the Navy and in the U.S. forces. A
major-general is not as well off as the
average American colonel.
What is destined for the R.A.A.F. is
not clear. Nearly all R.A.A.F. equip-
ment will be provided by Uncle Sam,
and General Brett, the Allied air com-
mander, will be supreme head. Whether
the R.A.A.F. will be merged for opera-
tional purposes with the U.S. Air Force,
which would entail change of squadron
strength and organisation, remains to be
seen; also, whether it will be converted
to an army accessory along American
lines.
The last question is one not to be
settled casually. Much depends on
whether Uncle Sam intends to provide
his own naval air force on an adequate
scale. But General Blarney will prob-
ably have the largest say of all. In view
of the long coastline and the thousands of
possible unfrequented landing places, air
organisation will have to be used more
as an army weapon in Australian defence
than it would be if points of possible
invasion were restricted.
Generals will have to envisage the pos-
sibility of using the air arm to hold up
attempted invasions while the land for-
mations can travel appreciable distances
to meet the enemy.
Liaison between land and air will
therefore have to be very close indeed.
The needs of the type of war which might
have to be fought, apart from the calls
of reconnaissance where sea invasion has
to be dealt with, will permit none of the
delays inherent in dualised operation.
Our Own War.
“Ek Dum”: This country’s experience
is proving how much military movement
can be in progress in a continent with-
out forcing itself on the attention of the
average citizen.
There is virtually no main road or
railway in the Commonwealth which is
not humming with military activity.
Mountains of equipment have been meta-
morphosed almost overnight into new
towns holding thousands of soldiers, and
new squadrons of aeroplanes are flung
into the air. But life, especially in the
bigger cities, goes on normally, or nearly
normally, except for the brownout; and
though the Easter holidays were curtailed
—except in the case of N.S.W. coalminers
—there were horse-races and dog-races
and the rest.
Heavy floods on the Markham have
prevented whatever chance the enemy
had of an advance on the New Guinea
goldfields. No doubt the tropical down-
pours and the flooded and muddy state
of landing grounds had a good deal to
do with the inhibition of air activity
against Moresby, Thursday Island and
other towns within actual range of
Japanese New Guinea bases. Such
attacks as were made brought retaliation
of a sort that provided pleasing evidence
that no Jap squadron can in future hope
to win its victories without paying dearly.
An Air-war Diary
March 31: Darwin had its ninth raid
in the afternoon, its tenth at night. In
the afternoon the enemy used seven two-
engined Mitsubishi bombers, which made
one run across the aerodrome and
dropped 25 or 30 bombs, but caused no
casualties or damage. Our fighters chased
the bombers out to sea and had a lively
dogfight with an O-type squadron. The
bombers, while it was in progress, got
away. One was damaged and one Jap
fighter destroyed.
In the evening the town had its first
night raid under a brilliant moon. The
visitors —three —were held by the search-
lights ; they dropped six bombs in two
circuits and then raced off into a sudden
tropical storm.
In spite of bad weather, Lae (New
Guinea) was raided by the Allies. Direct
hits were scored on hangars and the run-
way from 26,000 feet. Five fires were
started.
Over Salamaua a reconnoitring Allied
machine met three O-type fighters, one
diving in from the starboard bow, one
from above and one from below. The
rear-gunner bagged one for certain, and
he and the pilot probably shared in
destroying one and possibly two others
before they left, 12 minutes later. Two
R.A.A.F. men were wounded.
R.A.A.F. machines raided Koepang—
-600 miles from Broome and 470 from
Darwin —and apparently destroyed six
enemy ’planes on the ground.
The Allied bag for the day on the
Australian and Timor fronts was three
enemy craft destroyed, 10 probably
destroyed and five others, including four
flying-boats, damaged.
Moresby had an attack by a single
bomber, which had a wing shot off and
crashed.
April 1: R.A.A.F. machines raided
Koepang again, destroyed six more
’planes on the ground and damaged six
others, and returned safe. Raids against
Salamaua aerodrome were made in heavy
weather. All the machines came back.
April 2: Darwin’s eleventh raid: 35
bombs were dropped by seven bombers.
Nearly all; were “daisycutters,” which
destroyed some humble dwellings and
caused one minor casualty.
April 3: A general lull in raiding, but
some reconnaisance on both sides. The
weather in New Guinea was very bad,
April 4: Darwin’s seven heavy enemy
raiders came back once too often. A
welcoming delegation of fighters met
them and shot down two before they
reached their targets. A.-a, fire picked
up another which seemed to fall into
the sea. The remaining four came on
to meet a heavy a.-a. fire. The rear
machine began to trail smoke, then blew
into bits, bombs and all; the others flew
away. Two O-type fighters among their
escorts were limping as they disappeared
into the northern haze.
Another Allied raid on Koepang
started six large fires on the aerodrome.
The “firewood” appeared to be large
Jap ’planes. All Allied machines returned.
In an attack on Lae four bombers and
a fighter were left burning and 10 or 11
other aircraft were damaged.
Total enemy losses for the day were
apparently 17 ’planes destroyed and 10
or 11 damaged. Allied losses were two
machines.
April 5: Seven bombers, with seven
fighters weaving in V formations among
them, appeared to give Darwin its thir-
teenth raid. Only 20 bombs were
dropped ; a.-a. guns opened up, but did
not score. Little damage ; no casualties,
Moresby’s twenty-third raid did little
damage, though seven aircraft were used.
It cost the enemy a Zero fighter.
Troops Along the North
The lull on the northern air front and
the success of Allied forces latterly in
shooting down raiders on Australian soil
and at Koepang are spreading a spirit of
optimism and leading to the hope that
Japanese Headquarters will weigh the
cost for a long time before launching a
capital attack on the Commonwealth.
Optimism is all right, so long as it does
not communicate itself excessively to
Governments and generals.
The plain facts seem to be that there
are seven to nine Japanese divisions in
Java and the adjacent islands, including
at least part of the Imperial Guard. There
is another division or so in the eastern
part of the Dutch islands and Timor.
In the Marshalls there seem to be two
divisions, including a crack naval landing
division, and in New Guinea at least an-
other division. All these tot up to any-
thing from 180,000 to 250,000 men, not
counting the air force and strong naval
support.
Those troops are not there to hold
down the natives or for the good
of their health. They have been located
where they are, either in highly respect-
ful anticipation of a strong effort by the
Allies to reconquer the Indies from Aus-
tralia, or as a preliminary to a large-
scale attempt to add the Commonwealth
to their wretched victims.
You Can’t Keep Them Down!
Reported escapes by A.1.F., R.A.A.F.
and R.A.N. men from all points of the
compass go to prove Japan’s conquered
territory a leaky sieve which presently
will become a hive of borers unless
To jo is prepared to maintain vast armies
for the defence of his “Co-Prosperity”
sphere. Escaping is not limited to the
Digger who steals a prau. The art of
“beating it for home” has been hallowed
by its adoption by a divisional general
and several officers.
From Singapore has come batch after
batch. Some of the boys arrived on
stretchers, but most ready for further
fight. One lot turned up at the begin-
ning of last week, 30 strong out of 40
starters under Captain K. R. King. They
had souvenired a five-ton sailer, been
towed to Rengat in Sumatra by a British
tug and passed on to safety with the
help of the Dutch.
Captain E. P. Rowe, of Victoria,
hobbled out of a Singapore hospital,
crossed Sumatra and Java with a band
of courageous spirits, was blown off a
Norwegian ship by shellfire, spent 13
hours in the water, was saved, transferred
to a yacht owned by a Russian diver and,
with several R.A.A.F. men and some
civilians aboard, was presently wrecked
on the n.-w. coast of Australia.
Two weeks growing beards and living
on wallaby and water ended their adven-
tures before a passing vessel picked them
up.
Others from Malaya, from Java and
from “points north” are coming into Aus-
tralian ports every week, not to men-
tion the cheerful but haggard New
Guinea planters and miners who have
left the results of a life’s work behind
and rescued themselves at the cost of
unprecedented tramps through unex-
plored or almost unexplored mountains
on the brim of the rains.
The Tragedy of Rabaul.
“Ek D.”: For the first time a con-
nected narrative of the invasion and
capture of New Britain has been told—
told by ragged men who brought their
gaunt bodies to safety, sometimes still
weighed down with their arms, several
hundred miles round the unfrequented
southern arc of what the Germans called
“the Calm Sea.”
The story is a terrible reflection on
the “defence preparations” at a spot
which every strategist marked down as
the likely key base for an invasion of
eastern Australia. It seems to have been
thought that 1399 men, most of them
without tropical experience, were suffici-
ent to cover any enemy attempts at
attack.
The gallant little force, left without
lines of communication, was called on
to face a crack Japanese landing division
covered by warships and 12 squadrons
of Japanese bombers and fighters. The
recipe for warding off the air attack con-
sisted of five Wirraways—trainers—
whose boy pilots, heroes all, went up
against forces of 60 bombers and a
squadron of O-type fighters. They were
shot to pieces in a matter of minutes.
Incredible as it seems, they brought down
two Japanese machines and some of them
escaped by parachute.
One eyewitness —Sergeant F. S. Smith
from Brighton (Vic.) —said:
In those hectic days and in the terrible
days when we struggled toward safety, 1
saw plenty of examples of individual
courage, but for sheer cold-blooded hero-
ism I have never seen anything to compare
with the pilots of those Wirraways. They
knew they were doomed, but they had all
the guts in the world.
The enemy’s big air attack on Rabaul
took place on Jan. 20. Kavieng and the


Duke of York Islands saw their tiny
forces of defenders overrun by Japanese
marine landing parties the following day.
On Jan. 22 the main operations were
again at Rabaul. There with a complete
monopoly of the air the Japanese threw
in 110 machines of every type, from
fighters to heavy bombers, and plastered
objectives, particularly a 6in. battery
guarding the harbor mouth —the parapet
had been painted white —with a rain of
projectiles from gun and bomb rack. The
battery held out for nearly an hour. The
last man did not leave till guns and
searchlights had been blown off their
mountings.
The enemy, however, failed to make
a landing on the aerodrome, where two
machines crashed and a third was brought
down by a.-a. fire. By this time demoli-
tion charges were being touched off
everywhere by the defenders. The ex-
plosions culminated in a farewell to an
ammunition dump which went up with
a noise like Mother Mountain disinte-
grating.
Sunset came with the A.I.F. and militia
disposing themselves round the slopes of
Vulcan, which covers the harbor mouth,
waiting for the landing. Soon Japanese
’planes dropped flares into the velvety
blackness.
At 2.30 a.m. staccato Japanese voices
were heard. Torches flashed. Boats were
heard approaching the shore. Green
signal lights told the Jap convoy that
their advance parties were ashore. Their
bugler had only begun his assembly call
when the Australian fire began to mow
down the landing units, which had appar-
ently expected no resistance. Screams
and shouts followed, but there was no
return of fire.
Dawn showed a few of the enemy with
25 warships, transports and minesweepers
in Blanche Bay, grey against the Mother
and her daughters. Attack in force
began immediately by thousands of
enemy troops covered by naval guns and
over 100 ’planes, mostly dive-bombers
and fighters. The Australians caught the
landing barges, each with from 50 to 100
men, in a steady and well-directed mortar
fire, which sent whole boatloads
struggling and squealing into the water.
One force more than a brigade strong
was held up at Raluana Beach, on the
Kokopo side of the mouth of the bay
across the water from Rabaul, by a well-
wired obstruction and 150 men hidden
in positions to sweep the approaches with
a deadly cross fire. The water soon was
scarlet, thick with bodies over which
what seemed an endless procession of
barges drove in heedlessly. One private
said that the yells and squeals of the
enemy almost drowned the rattle of the
firing. The wire looked like a series of
dreadful clotheslines hung with red, drip-
ping washing. For about 200 yards the
enemy dead were said by some to have
been stacked six feet high, and defenders
later accounted for many more. It is
estimated that that particular landing cost
Japan 1500 men, but the defenders got off
with 20 slight casualties. They brought
the enemy to a standstill.
While the attackers hesitated there was
time for the Australians to slip off into
the bush to the waiting trucks. Bombed,
machine-gunned, attacked by grenadier
groups, other defensive parties were
gradually driven out of fixed positions
by a continuous stream of fresh attackers.
By noon most of the fighting was over.
Almost 2000 Japanese lay dead. The
Australians before they had made their
way by Kokopo to the bush behind had
had 300 casualties. Half the total force
had not been accounted for. The
Japanese say they have 700 prisoners.
The residue of 400 battle-weary men
moved out in trucks, ceaselessly but in-
accurately bombed, along the road to
Rabata, 30 miles away.
At Rabata food was picked up. The
units moved into the tangle of jungle
and kunai which forms a terrible screen
between wildest New Britain and civili-
sation. There it rains almost ceaselessly.
The soil is slippery. The ravines which
had to be crossed were fearsome, but day
after day the retreating force pushed on,
sometimes on one meal a day, consisting
of one-twelfth of a tin of bully beef and
an army biscuit. Friendly natives later
fed them on taro and sweet potatoes. At
night they nursed their malaria and
dysentery in huddled and dripping groups.
Many of their sick and wounded had to
be carried.
The Japanese, who seemed to be armed
almost exclusively with their light .25
calibre automatic, made landings two
days after their capture of Rabaul on
the Bainings, about 50 miles away.
There they dumped down 5000 men at
Massawa —it is level country with clean
beaches—and 200 at Lassul a few miles
further up the coast. They evidently
hoped to cut off the retreat.
When the writer was last in that out-
of-the-way part of the country its sole
regular communication was a Japanese
schooner. But the track up the hills is
tough and almost impassable in rain.
Captain Cameron, of the 2/22 Bat-
talion, said that the Japanese evidently
had fifth-column guidance. The fact is
that they knew the place like a book,
and what they did not know of their
own knowledge the residue of Germans
taught them.
What did W. M. Hughes say at Rabaul
when he was a member of the Lyons
Government? Oh, yes: “We have got
our Mandate. On this rock we have
built our church, and all hell is not
going to take away what we have.”
St. N a zaire and After.
“Nobby II”; Advocates of a Second
Front in Europe are being led into deeper
masses of idiocy by the hopes raised in
them by the St. Nazaire adventure.
One fathead remarked that “there are
hundreds of thousands of men where the
raiders came from,” and that “it must
not be forgotten that a few ships hastily
mustered carried 250,000 British soldiers
across the Channel to Britain from Dun-
kirk.”
It must not be forgotten either that the
250,000 men left behind them practically
every bit of armament and transport
equipment, and that the ships assembled
in a wonderful improvisation landed
them under cover of friendly guns and
’planes. Had they been called on to
land them on a hostile and well-defended
enemy coast the results would have been
too dreadful to contemplate.
St. Nazaire was in the same category
as the Lofoten raids, save that it was
made by a very small and highly-trained
force against a heavily fortified position
for a definite purpose. It was a lineal
descendant of the constant naval raiding
of the British Navy along France’s shores
during the Napoleonic wars. The main
object was to wreck the only battleship
dock and harbor available to the enemy
west of the Channel, The landing force
employed was a demolition party. As
little air cover as possible was in use,
the smallest and fastest naval vessels were
requisitioned, and the men who went
ashore knew that they were on a forlorn
hope, so far as returning was concerned.
The main object of the raid was
achieved. The gate of the dock, which
once held the Normandie, was smashed,
as aerial photography showed subse-
quently, and heavy damage was seem-
ingly done to U-boat basins, though
graving-dock accommodation for cruisers
is still intact.
The shoregoing “commandos” appar-
ently established strongpoints in the town
and drove the Germans out for a time —
the enemy mentioned that “the town was
completely in German hands again by
8 a.m.” But none of Lt.-Colonel A. C.
Newman’s landing party appears to have
returned to England.
The whole method of the expedition
and its equipment and shipping was
eloquent of the Navy’s realisation that
any flotilla of landing boats which at-
tempted to remain more than a matter
of minutes in the Loire would be wiped
out by the sheer weight of the defence,
which, so soon as the advance guard was
discovered, “crisscrossed the whole river
with a fantastic pattern of fire.”
Even in the few minutes which the
landing operation occupied, the glare
“raised from burning British and Ger-
man vessels rivalled the searchlight
beams,” and the survivors of the
explosive-laden destroyer Campbelltown,
after she had been set to ram the dock-
gate, had to get out at full speed in a
motor torpedo boat through “a rapid fire
at 50 yards range.”
That sort of venture is a luxury to be
indulged in only as a last resource—
except in the dreams of editor- and soap-
box-strategists to whom British lives and
British ships don’t seem to matter.
"Second Front in Europe."
“Ek Dum”: Sir Stafford Cripps, re-
turning to London on January 24, said
then that Russia had 9,000,000 men under
arms ; that the front-line troops “were
splendidly endowed with everything they
need,” and those further back adequately
equipped, with reserves approaching fight-
ing trim; and that Russia was probably
“turning out more war materials than
when Germany invaded the country.”
“The Russians,” he added, “are deter-
mined to wipe out the Nazis even if it
means marching to Berlin” ; they “intend
to make the conquest of Germany abso-
lutely complete and thorough before next
winter,” and “the German armies are in
a very poor way indeed.”
The Soviet Government has several
times confirmed the existence of large
reserves, fully equipped and trained.
With 9,000,000 men under arms, it should
be in an unassailable position. Never-
theless Communists, Left-Wing journalists
and Pink clergymen, in Australia as in
Britain, insist that John Bull, with
46,000,000-odd million people, who till a
few months ago bore the whole air and
naval burden of the war and are still bear-
ing a very large share of it, must estab-
lish a Second Front to ease the strain
on Russia’s vastly superior man-power
and equipment.
The only country in which the Soviet
armies can be helped is Russia itself.
The Russian official attitude to a
Second Front was stated by Maisky, the
Soviet Ambassador in London:
The secret of victory consists in having
a decisive preponderance over the enemy at
a decisive moment and at a decisive
place The time is now ripe The de-
cisive moment is the year 1942; the decisive
place is the front of the U.S.S.R. If, as I
strongly hope, the Allies will take this road,
then the backbone of Hitlerite Germany
will be broken this year.
The only kind of victory which would
settle the fate of the war on the Con-
tinent “in 1942” would be a complete
and utter rout of the Germans by Russia
within the next three months.
Sir Stafford Cripps mentioned that the
bulk of Russia’s increased war produc-
tion has been moved east of the Urals.
This means that, for actual defence pur-
poses at the present time, the bulk of the
material used by Stalin’s armies must be
carried from 1000 to 2000 miles by rail,
placing a vast strain on railway main-
tenance, fuel and transport man-power,
apart from anything else. And the Rus-
sian railways are not much good.
For actual invasion of Germany, the
front would have to be moved forward
five to ten miles per day throughout the
summer, while railway gauges on 15,000
miles or so of line would need to be
reconverted to the Russian standard. In
the end, the bulk of supplies would still
be coming from beyond the Urals, a
minimum of 1800 miles.
In the circumstances, without a com-
plete German collapse of morale, no de-
cisive or even turn-of-the-tide victory can
be hoped for until the Allies have mus-
tered their maximum strength and until
their command of sea lanes is complete
and their marine transport adequate.
There is hope of achieving that in
1943, provided shipbuilding schedules are
maintained, and provided Britain and the
U.S.A. can produce a sufficient flow of
heavy aircraft to assure that Germany
and German-held shipbuilding yards and
ports get what is due to them throughout
the summer.
Serious as the position might be which
would result from a German victory over
Russia, it would not be decisive. Even
the conquest of all Asia would not be
decisive. Britain is far from exhausted,
and Uncle Sam and the Dominions have
scarcely yet felt the first strain of their
war effort. Their resources are virtually
untouched. Of them all, outside Britain,
only Canada is in full stride of produc-
tion. Germany must long ago have
reached the highest tempo of its effort.
And so long as the actual defences of
Britain, the Dominions and U.S. are not
breached the war is not lost.
The most noticeable feature of the
Russian fronts is the increasing German
interest in them. The Russians have re-
ported an abortive attempt by the
Staraya Russa army to break out and
violent German counter-attacks all along
the line, mainly north-west of Moscow
in the Kalinin area. On this front, the
Russians claimed to have killed 10,000
Germans and captured quantities of
materials during the last fortnight of
March.
On the Leningrad front they claimed
to have pierced some German positions,
and in the last eight days of March to
have destroyed 12,000 Germans.
Russian and German reports mention
heavy fighting in the Kharkov sector.
The Germans say a Russian offensive in
this area has been repulsed.
The Germans for the first time for
months speak of forward patrol activi-
ties, of small advances and the clearing
up of Russian pillboxes and minefields,
mainly on the sector which covers the
points of junction between the northern
and central army groups—operations
which would be in keeping with the be-
ginning of a drive to recover lost ground
between the Valdai Hills and the Volga
sources back to the Moscow-Leningrad
railway. And the High Command issued
its first estimate of Russian losses since
December. It claimed the capture of
104,128 Russian prisoners and the de-
struction of 2167 tanks, 2519 guns and
2720 ’planes. It suggested that these
figures “gave some indication of the
Russian offensive”; but asserted that,
with the advent of spring weather, the
offensive was now coming to an end and
Russian efforts were flagging.
April 6 was the first anniversary of
the German attack on Greece and Yugo-
slavia. It may be well to remember that
the enemy carried out no winter offen-
sives in 1939-40 or 1940-41.
The War In Asia.
“Ek Dum”; Intermittent fighting con-
tinued last week in the Philippines, where
the Japanese made strong attacks by air
on Corregidor and lost heavily in bloody
but sporadic fighting on the Bataan
frontal perimeter. They made one
attempt to land on the eastern flank of
the defending force —on the beaches
inside Manila Bay. The defence was
ready for them. Their landing parties
were blown to bits.
In Burma, the Japanese advance moves
relentlessly on. The Japanese have air
superiority ; and, indeed, it is the old tale
of a superior umbrella and overwhelm-
ing numbers, Prome has fallen, and to
the north British main forces on April
6 were retiring, covered by a special for-
mation which again and again checked
the Japanese along the Irrawaddy road.
The oilfields have presumably ceased to
be of further use to Britain.
In the Sittang Valley, to the east,
Chinese were struggling at the week-end
with a superior force a few miles north
of Toungoo, It is doubtful whether much
of Burma can be saved. Apart from any-
thing else, general native treachery is a
serious handicap.
Indian refugees are now pouring out of
Burma at the rate of thousands a day,
and the war has edged across the Bay of
Bengal to Ceylon. It was hoped that the
Flying Fortresses which attacked the
newly-established Andaman Island base
—it was the first appearance of For-
tresses in the Indian area —would stave
off any chance of attack for a time. The
assault was led in person by the com-
mander of the U.S.A.F. in India, Major-
General Brereton. It fired a cruiser and
a troopship and damaged two other ships.
Colombo was raided on April 5. The
forcp used was about the same in
numbers, but not in composition, as that
which made the first raid on Darwin —
about seven or eight squadrons, largely
fighters, which must have come from a
carrier since the Andamans are nearly
1000 miles away.
Colombo was ready. The enemy con-
centrated on the centre of the city, which
lies across a narrow peninsula, and the
harbor, which is placed in as close
proximity to the town as Sydney Cove is
to Sydney. The defenders’ losses were
slight.
Of the enemy squadrons 25 were
smashed to bits, five more were probably
destroyed and 25 others were damaged.
Any damage to ’planes operating 90.0
miles from their nearest land base is
likely to be disaster.
If the rest of the defence is as good
on the western side of Bengal’s Bay, there
will be no Pearl Harbors or Rabauls.
There still seems to be sporadic fight-
ing in the Celebes, though the enemy
declares that its surrender is complete.
Two Jap light cruisers have been sunk
s.-w, of Java by U.S. submarines.
The Americans report the loss of Lang-
ley (11,059 tons), an aircraft-carrier —she
was once a collier —south of Java late in
February, also of the tanker Pecos. About
a dozen men went down with the Lang-
ley. The loss of the destroyer Peary
(with her captain, Lt.-Commander John
Bermingham) during the raid on Darwin
on Feb. 19 has also been announced. Out
of total complements of 1156 officers and
men, 700 went down with the three ships.
* * * *
The position of the sea war in the
Atlantic is far from satisfactory. Admiral
King, U.S. naval commander-in-chief,
has announced that 98 Allied ships were
sunk in the Atlantic between Dec. 7 and
March 28 —51 off the eastern U.S. coast.
♦ * * *
The Germans have made more fuss
about the British raid on Liibeck than
about anything else which has happened
to a German city. It must have been
on a Plymouth or Portsmouth scale.
There have been several R.A.F. sweeps
over France and the Lowlands, in some
of which a new Australian Spitfire squad-
ron joined. A few raiders were over
the south of England.
* * * *
The Mediterranean is alive with mov-
ing troops. The Axis is concentrating men
and materials in Greece and Crete, and
Malta’s gallant little band of defenders
and civilians lives in what has become
an almost continuous air raid. Raids
now are usually made by Stukas in bulk,
with 30 or 40 Messerschmitts to fend off
Spitfires and Hurricanes. No other com-
munity has ever suffered such an experi-
ence as Malta. Rommel’s force in Libya
is reported to have been built up to its
original November strength—two self-
contained armored divisions and six
Italian divisions, with mechanised cavalry
and artillery support.

The Red Cross reports that those game
lads from Wake Island, who are interned
in Shikoku Island, are well housed and
well treated.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
Our alerts are not without their
humorous side. When the group from a
city relief depot called the roll on arrival
at the deep shelter during last week’s trial
air-raid warning, it found that an octo-
genarian spinster was missing. Theories
as to how and why were rudely shattered
on return to work when she was found
to be in the dressing-room, having com-
pletely changed—into night attire. Her
motive was simple. “I’m too old to run
for shelter, but if I’m hit they can put
me straight to bed in the hospital,” she
explained, and added that she had always
carried a nightgown for years in case
she had an accident. There seems to be
no general rule about typewriting
machines. In some offices it is the rule
to seize the machine and carry it to the
shelter. In others, machines are covered,
and the workers assemble on their floor
post and march down to the shelters three
abreast holding arms. Community sing-
ing was started in one shelter, but as it
drowned the “all clear” it is not so
popular.
Now that the lid is off the news that
American nurses are in Australia it is
permissible to record that for many a
day they have kept the Nurses’ Hostel
on Domain-road from becoming coma-
tose. They made the other girls’ eyes
goggle when they went shopping and the
parcels began to roll up. And their purr-
ing of the R’s on the telephone when
their boy friends rang them up was a
happy accompaniment to life in a some-
what retired quarter. They are all ages
and sizes and types. There are little girls
of the Janet Gaynor type who look
barely old enough to be through a
nurse’s course, but who turn out to have
years of special work to their credit, and
there are others of the real British Army
nurse variety. There’s already a battle
royal raging in Army nurse circles as to
whether their uniforms are more attrac-
tive than Australian girls can show.
Maoriland girls think theirs the best.
The Easter wedding furore is appar-
ently, like the late Queen Anne, an affair
of the past. Easter brides there certainly
were, but the rationing of leave over the
last six months has brought so many
service men to the altar that Easter Satur-
day couples were no more numerous and
not different from those of many Satur-
days past. There was no extra glamor,
either, for flowers are scarcer, and no
’planes brought them from afar. Nor
did many churches ring their wedding
chimes. And as for cars, nowadays
couples chart the metropolitan area and
see where most of their friends live, pick
a near-by reception-house and print on
their invitations to the wedding “Trams
pass the door.”
When someone decides to write the
story of Australia’s early families John
Mitchell the Rebel will probably figure
just as a stern patriot, but according to
Mrs. Sheila Monks, one of his descen-
dants, he was also a lover of herbs, and
the herb lore has descended in the family.
So well was Mrs. Monks acquainted with
what the countries of the world would
need for culinary purposes once they
were cut off from France that she was
able to suggest at once to the Govern-
ment how Australia could step into the
breach. Now at Government House
Mews and the Observatory she has all
the paraphernalia for drying herbs when
they come from women all over the
continent, who are growing them for the
troops. Tremendous orders are reaching
her, such as one for 1200 gross the other
day. Navy, army, air force all cook with
the herbs supplied from the centre, where
500 helpers assist Mrs. Monks. Some
of the devoted growers in New South
Wales have been watering their herbs
with their bathwater for months. She
calls her work “Herbs for the Fighting
Forces.” Those who have any fragrant
thyme, sage, marjoram or mint to spare
should send it to the Recruiting Office,
Melbourne Town Hall, where it will be
picked up by some of the workers.
Labelled so, boxes of herbs are carried
free on the trains.
It was a bright idea of rose-lovers to
resuscitate the General MacArthur rose
in honor of Mrs. Douglas MacArthur.
As a presentation bouquet several
General MacArthurs with their warm red
leaves and their sweet scent look as well
as any floral tribute. The rose itself is
an old variety. Several Box Hill gardens
were searched for the requisite number
of perfect blooms to give the lady at the
Royal Horticulture Society’s show at
Burnley on Saturday. A whisper that
Alister Clark, prince of rose-growers, is
contemplating calling his newest rose
after Mrs. MacArthur may well be true.
Mr. Clark, in addition to Black Boy,
Sunny South and Lorraine Lee roses,
known all over the world, has produced
the Doris Downes, called after the wife
of Major-General R. M. Downes, the
Edith Clark, called after his own wife,
the Amy Johnson, Lady More Ruthven
and Valerie Purves. It looks as if red
roses might now become the rage.
Already brides are calling for them for
their ’maids.
Mrs. H. C. Reilly, whose address used
to be Rokewood, Sime-road, Singapore,
is in Melbourne as guest of onetime
Agent-General Richard Linton and his
wife. Mrs. Reilly likes Victoria, for it
was the place of her birth, her Scotch
parents having dropped in just in time
to give her the privilege of being Vic-
torian-born. She is, like most Singapore
visitors, hard at work, but has enough
time left to repudiate accusations that
Singapore women played cards while the
city prepared to burn. The truth was
that most women worked eight hours a
day and many 12 to 17 in the steamy heat
of Singapore helping with comforts for
the troops and in other war work. Mrs.
Reilly, who has not played golf since the
war started, is emphatic that hers is not
an unusual case.
Another canard that Mrs. Reilly says
makes her hot under the collar is the old
one that Australian troops were over-
looked by the Comforts Fund’s distribu-
tion in Malaya. Her husband was closely
associated with the fund, and she can
emphasise General Gordon Bennett’s
repudiation of the charges that Austra-
lians were excluded from the fund’s dis-
tributions. As one of the originators
of the Anzac Club for Australian troops
in Singapore, Mrs. Reilly was closely in
touch with the work except when illness
kept her away from the opening of the
new building for the club. From the be-
ginning of the war she held a war job
at Government House, and the Japs were
on the lawns of her own home when
word came to her that she must take ship
without seeing her husband to say good-
bye. She is still without news of him, but
hugs the slender hope that he might have
escaped. Broothorn made this picture of
her.
Saturday night saw Melbourne’s theatre
street going gay with two first nights —
Strauss’s “Die Fledermaus,” translated
this time as “Nightbirds,” at His
Majesty’s, and “The Man Who Came to
Dinner” at the Comedy, across the street-
Some people popped into both shows, as
they felt they could not miss the thrill of
welcoming Edwin Styles to straight
comedy in this town, but could not for-
sake, the Gilberts in their dashing new
move. As a result ghostly figures flitted
across Russell-street all the evening,
a procedure made easier by the
paucity of cars. After the shows every-
one walked up and down Collins-street
trying to find a spot in which to park
themselves and party in the dozen or so
little restaurants into which old houses
have been transformed for the duration
(and perhaps after). Into these the
players also strolled, and at one, while
partaking of coffee and sandwiches, the
company was joined by Max Oldaker,
all cheery after the great response he had
got from the bumper audience at His
Majesty’s, Len Getting and Chas. Kil-
burn.
It did the heart good to see our
Gladys” mounting the steps to her box
at “Nightbirds.” She looked radiant,
and she was so intent on Thea Philips’s
performance that a few began guessing
what might be planned. Uniforms were
the glamor note at both houses, but the
Comedy certainly had the navy, blue and
gold in excess of its rival. It also was
the home from home chosen by Dod
Falkiner of the raven locks (with one white
lock so distinguee ). Nowadays Dod is
a W.A.A.A.F., and her tall slenderness
was suited to perfection by the uniform.
Mrs. Potter, who looks after the Comedy
publicity, was receiving congratulations
on a race against time with fox furs, get-
ting them to the theatre for Lorraine
Sheldon (Yvonne Banvard) to wear for
her first entrance in Act II of “The Man.”
From Sydney
Rosehill is a dear little course. It has
trees at the back of the stands, and the
track in front of them. It has also a
horseshoe superimposed on a miniature
fountain just inside the turnstiles. Prob-
ably none of the 30,000 punters who
went there on Saturday noticed these
things (except the track), which most
have seen so often. One thing hit them
in the face, and it was the cold wind.
It was quite sub-Antarctic. It pinged
through the green trellis work of the
“light refreshments” pavilion with the
sting of hail. But in spite of all this
there were fewer furs and far fewer lush
ones than have been seen on many a
warmer day.
Suits, tailored or thereabouts, were the
wear. Topcoats were often in check.
Hats were as they came. In short, it was
probably the first autumn meeting to
which women went clothed rather than
dressed. A middle-aged unknown, how-
ever, wore in high relief against her
brown cloth coat a deep collar of fair
dinkum ermine. It would be impossible
to reckon out its value even in potatoes.
Phillipa Stephen was trig in navy and
white. She was part time with brother
Alister and part time with Mrs. Rag
Bettington. Noreen Dangar was wrapped
in a black topcoat.
Major John McCaffrey, back from ser-
vice abroad, Joan Inglis, Mrs. Tom Cross-
ing, tailored in grey, Mrs. P. A'. Cameron,
of the Feminist Club, soldiers of the
A.1.F., girls whose hats had a Digger
slant, girls whose heads sported little
toques like gob caps, boys of the U.S.A.
forces and Riti Van Staveren, whose father
is Rear-Admiral Van Staveren, of the
N.E.I. Navy, were amid the moving
throngs. Hats being as they were (as
they were last year), the absorbing thing
to do was to watch the horses being exer-
cised. The handsome Beau Vite, the
elegant Hesione were worth the journey
to Rosehill. But thank heaven no raiders
flew in from the sea while a race was
in progress. The effect of an alert on
the 20,000 people packed in the stands
and on the strip of lawn before them
can be imagined.
This intent gaze is probably the one
worn by Mrs. Ernest Watt when she was
thinking out the design for the penny seals
which are always featured on the flap of
the really nice letters one receives. The
seal shows a V.A., hands outstretched in
appeal, behind her the red cross superim-
posed on the map of Australia. The
money from the sale of seals goes to-
wards the Lady Cowrie Red Cross Fund.
In the twelve months of their work
£lO,OOO has been garnered by the Seals in
N.S.W. In the last four months £4OOO
has rolled in to help the sick and wounded,
all in pennies. Mrs. Nigel Smith is
the able and amiable president of this
State’s Seals Committee. Phillipa Stephen
is the treasurer. John Lee made this pic-
ture of Mrs. Ernest Watt.
A crowded Theatre Royal greeted
“Claudia” on Saturday night. The play
fascinated Melbourne for 16 weeks. The
Girl in the Flat Opposite declares that
Melbourne is so populated with the
“Claudia” black taffeta skirt that the
place rustles like an avenue of dry leaves
in an autumn wind. Anyway, this
bouncy, short skirt with its rows of white
braid as worn by heroine Terry Walker
should make quite good theatre wear
these blackout nights. “Claudia” is a
play of characterisation. It gets a new
angle on sex by bringing the farmyard
to the stage. This makes the audience
feel bucolic and close to the soil. Nature
is so wonderful.
Star of the night in the audience was
Major-General Gordon Bennett. With
him was his wife, who not only wore
long frock and silver fox cape, but added
orchids, long earrings and an attractive
hairdo. That should be a hint to all
lasses who have soldier escorts. Colonel
and Mrs. Moore Cosgrave, singer Strella
Wilson, in lustrous white satin, the H. J.
Bradys, Mrs. Don Symington, of Rabaul,
Mrs. Toby Browne and newly-engaged
daughter Nuala and the Frank Alberts
were among people noted. Afterwards
most of the young blood went off danc-
ing. Prince’s was crowded. These nights
it harbors the service uniforms of almost
as many nationalities as could be seen in
pre-war days at the Dublin horse show.
One of the most popular of Sydney’s
visiting warriors is Philippe de Gio.
The Wings Club of Halifax (Canada)
has “Welcome” on its glass doors. And
Australian flying boys have found that
the word means exactly what it says.
This is the favorite meeting spot for
Aussies awaiting embarkation, and here
the fliers are served with good food,
fruit, cigarettesand find plenty of
stationery, magazines, books and such-
like for their use. The clubrooms are
in the Nova Scotia Hotel, and Mrs.
Mathers, wife of the Governor of Nova
Scotia, delights in entertaining the lads
from Australia and Maoriland. A recent
photograph shows a group of them get-
ting intimately acquainted with a pluto-
cratic looking turkey. Three Sydneyites
are in the picture: Sergeant-Observer
Frank Cummins, of Rose Bay, Sergeant
Air Gunner Douglas Simpson, of Manly,
and Sergeant-Observer Kenn Brodziak,
of Darling Point.
Mrs. Don Symington, who for some
years has made her home, first in the
Solomon Islands and later in New
Guinea, was the guest of honor at the
Society of Women Writers’ lunch last
week. She painted the Solomons as an
idyll set in a turquoise sea. She told of
the peace that enfolded the days, and
showed sketches of tropic tree and flower
painted by herself and her sister Theo
Cowan. She described the wild beauty
of the Markham Valley as seen from the
air, and described the easy, happy way
of life in places on which the Portu-
guese left the imprint of gracious-sound-
ing names, and on which the Japanese
have left the imprint of bombs. She also
translated a recipe for making a custard
into pidgin English—the language in
which the housewife instructs the native
“boys.”
The Girl in the Flat Opposite says that,
now that synthetic liquor is being made
in England, she supposes that all the
poor old out-of-work bootleggers will be
busily and happily employed again—if
they can get to England. That’s one side
of the picture. But on the other side
consider the frightful increase -in unem-
ployment of the ladies in Australia who
make their living by reading teacups.
With the tea ration of one ounce per
person per week there won’t be a tealeaf
to spare for their predictions.
■lf ever there is a world where auction
sales are not, then Max Lawson, of the
well-known firm, will be able to make
big money doing his famed auctioneer
act. Anyone desirous of seing him in
slow and swift motion, and at the same
time of having the chance to secure a
Gruner, a Tom Roberts, a Heysen, a
Hilder or a Sydney Ure Smith, should
be at the Macquarie Galleries not later
than half-past one tomorrow (Thursday).
The Rodney Dangars have given from
their admired collection 19 paintings and
five etchings to be sold at auction for
the Red Cross. To the cause Justice
Nicholas has donated two lithographs
and two pencil drawings, and John D.
Moore one of his own water-colors.
Now that the Americans are here
Annette Kellerman, who lived so long in
the U.S.A., should get big trans-Pacific
audiences. Dates are arranged for the
first three performances in Sydney of the
revue “We’re All In It,” directed by
Annette, who has organised the whole
company. It is known as the Red Cross
Theatrical Unit, and will tour all the
metropolitan areas in aid of Red Cross
funds. The first night will be at Marnck-
ville Town Hall on April 13, the second
at the Masonic Hall, Kogarah, on April
22, and the third at the Town Hall, Rock-
dale, on April 27. Executives of metro-
politan Red Cross branches have been
invited to the premiere so that they can
see the show and book it for their
suburbs. There are over 60 members in
the company, and guest artists will van
the programme from time to time.
Recent engagement is that of Eileen
Peppard, of North Fitzroy, Melbourne,
and Dr. James Conquest, whose home is
at St. Kilda, Melbourne, but who is at
present in Sydney.


SPORTING NOTIONS
(Conducted by "PILOT")
A crowd of 30,000 at Rosehill on
Saturday gave an idea of what the at-
tendance would have reached at Rand-
wick if the A.J.C. could have held the
autumn meeting on its own course. There
was scarcely room to move in the pad-
dock or leger, and, though there was a tote
turnover of £30,041, that was on the lean
side compared with what it would have
been with greater facilities. The club did
all that was possible in connection with
passenger transport, but for many people
the train trip to and from the course
was an unpleasant experience.
Success in an important handicap
seems just beyond Evergreen, who was
favorite for the Doncaster. Soho and
Rylstone were cutting at each other
almost from the start, but when Ever-
green, whom Munro had in a handy
position throughout, took the lead from
Soho in the straight his backers were on
good terms with themselves. Their jubi-
lation was short, as Tuhitarata, who was
fifth or sixth at the turn, then put in his
claim and settled Evergreen in short
order, while Arahura cut the latter out
of second money in the last few strides.
Arahura is the best of our three-year-
old fillies, and she must have been right
off the day she was beaten into third
place in the Adrian Knox Stakes.
Beaulivre, who did not jump away
cleanly, was third at the turn, but in the
straight was passed by High Caste, who
moved very short in his preliminary and
was in a hopeless position at the three
furlongs. His fourth was a good effort.
John Halifax was sixth, and was well
clear of the remainder. Rimveil was not
sighted, nor was Sir Richard, and Soho
tired over the last furlong, as did
Panchio, who moved up smartly at the
turn. Tuhitarata’s best previous effort in
a big handicap was when he ran second
to Geebung (ridden by Badger) in the
1939 Epsom Handicap. He is a six-year-
old black horse by imported Simeon’s
Fort—also a Doncaster winner—from
Valeriante, by Valais.
It’s Funny may not be a great three-
year-old, but there is no doubt as to his
gameness. Lambeth took charge from
Liege, Yaralla and It’s Funny at the top
of the straight, but though at the leger a
win for him appeared almost certain he
commenced to weaken a little further on,
and by dint of hard riding on Bartle’s
part It’s Funny drew level fifty yards
from the winning post and eventually
scored by half a length. It was Bartle’s
second St. Leger win, his previous one
being on Limarch. It’s Funny was a
375gns. yearling, and is by Constant Son
from Roscome, by Rossendale from
Comic, by Absurd.

Yaralla was kept well at the rear of
the field for the first mile and was still
conceding a lot of start to the pacemaker,
Liege, and Lambeth commencing the last
five furlongs. He then moved up so
rapidly that he was third at the turn.
That was the end of him, and he finished
fourth. It appears certain now he cannot
get a distance, no matter how he may be
ridden. Chatham’s Choice is not as good
as in the spring, and Dark Warbler and
Rosabelle were outclassed.
• ••••ft
Beau Vite duly accounted for the
Autumn Plate, in which he was second
to Buzalong along the back, with Veiled
Threat third. Beau Vite was in charge
at the top of the straight, and had no
difficulty in winning from Veiled Threat,
who ran on again after dropping back
nearing the bend. Dashing Cavalier, who
looked in need of more racing, was third,
followed by Dewar, who, after whipping
in most of the way, made a dash in the
straight. Velocity is not a weight-for-age
horse. It is the same with Pantler, who
was fourth for home, but, troubled by his
9.3, finished last.
Apart from the fact that she started
from an outside position, little excuse
was possible for Hesione’s defeat in the
Sires’ Produce Stakes. Hall Stand was
smartest away, but Hesione was along-
side him at the half-mile post, and they
remained close together to the straight
entrance. Hall Stand then ran right away
from Hesione, and, as seven furlongs
found the latter out at Flemington, it
would seem as if staying is not going to
be his forte. Bred by H. S. Thompson,
and sold privately by him for lOOOgns.
early this season, Hall Stand is by Hall
Mark from Trasina, by Woorak from
Rosina (a brilliant two-year-old), by The
Welkin.
Angel’s previous form did not suggest
she had any chance in this field, but she
finished well to get third, not far ahead
of Niagara, Main Topic and War Effort,
who were almost in line. Niagara and
Main Topic did well over the last three
furlongs and are staying possibilities.
As Battle Dress’s showing was at com-
plete variance with her previous efforts
and recent track form she evidently was
not in galloping humor.
Pannett, who continues to improve,
was always prominent in the first division
of the Vaucluse Handicap, and won
cleverly from Tyrannus and the English-
bred colt Tidemark, who, but for stum-
bling badly shortly after commencing
the last furlong and narrowly missing a
fall, might have given a different result.
Valve, who looked as if he would be all
the better for his run, was a close fourth,
but only a little in advance of Irish Sea,
Overbold, as usual, commenced slowly,
and did well to run sixth after being
ahead of only two horses at the five fur-
longs post.
Astrid was hopelessly left at the start
of the second division of the Vaucluse
Handicap, and after Lagoon had led
from barrier-rise to the straight he was
outstayed by Guild Hall (another Hall
Mark), who, as his tote dividend was at
the rate of a little over 156 to 1, must
have surprised his owner and trainer
almost as much as nearly everyone else.
The three place-getters were practically
at the head of affairs throughout, but
though Milanja hung on well enough to
beat Bonny Loch for third he never
looked like winning. Bonny Loch should
shortly re-enter the winning list, but Beau
Son did not flatter those backers who
made him second favorite. Monte Christo
ran fairly, and Beau Timide is improving.
Stylish and Triggerman, who shared
favoritism for the City Handicap, cut up
badly, and Angus, running past Fearless
at the turn, held Fearless Fox in a great
tussle over the final furlong. Fifty yards
from home the last-named horse looked
a winner, and should be a little better at
his next start. Wellesley, in third place,
finished strongly, and in getting fourth,
after being one of the tail-enders starting
the back stretch. Patrician reads like a
winner in the near future. At the turn
Jymjon appeared a possible place-getter,
but weakened, as did Happy Lass. From
the turn nothing outside Angus and Fear-
less Fox looked like winning.
Ballycummins, an Irish-bred horse with
little form to recommend him, gave book-
makers a 33-to-l result when he squeezed
between Saul and Similar and won a
“blanket” finish for the £lO5O W.R.C.
Easter Cup at Flemington on Saturday.
A four-year-old chestnut entire by Beres-
ford from Sonia, owned by J. Wren and
trained by V. O’Neill, his only previous
win had been recorded in a small race
at Ballarat. He had been generally re-
garded as a sprinter until “set” for a
first-up attempt on the Australian Cup,
and, although he failed at the finish of
that race, his trainer conceded him a fair
chance on Saturday.
• •••••
Stamina, combined with his light
weight, won the Cup for Ballycummins,
who might develop into a really good
handicapper next spring. On Saturday
he was ridden by apprentice K. Smith,
whose master, R. Cameron, saddled the
favorite, Tranquil Star. Latter was ridden
perfectly by Breasley, but died in her
run after looking dangerous at the top
of the straight and finished sixth. Nine-
stone-three on a rain-affected track was
too much for her. Well-backed Maikai
finished fifth without ever being a danger,
and at the age of eight he may have seen
his best days.
Law Student gave the “straight-six
theory” a jolt when he stuck to the
allegedly slow side of the track and de-
feated All Veil and Zonda in the Seaside
Handicap, He was the first winner along-
side the grandstand rails for some time,
and, as he had won on the opposite side
of the course at his previous start, would
have started shorter than 8 to I—longer1—longer
prices were bet —had he been drawn near
the inside rails. He was one of the
leaders all the way, and battled on
strongly to complete a double for his
rider, W. Beresford, who had won earlier
on Art Union. Law Student is a three-
year-old by Law Maker, and impresses
as likely to develop into a first-class
sprinter.
- c • • • •
Bobby Pearce followed up his Moonee
Valley success of a week earlier by de-
feating Reply Paid and Jameson in the
second Juvenile Handicap. The Mid-
stream colt was bred by his part-owner,
A. Lechte, and is a decidedly useful gal-
loper who combines speed and stamina.
His time for the seven furlongs was a
second and a quarter slower than re-
corded by Huntingdale in winning the
first division, but Bobby Pearce carried
201 b. more weight, and was the more im-
pressive of the pair. Huntingdale, who
started at 25 to 1 and returned a tote
dividend of to 1, won rather well
from Ortolan and Register.
Somerset, aged 11, gave his younger
rivals a galloping lesson in the second
Federal Handicap, in which he finished
strongly to win from Gay Revelry and
Carpentier. Somerset simply refuses to
grow old, and Saturday’s success took his
record to 21{ wins from 117 starts. Prince
Ronald proved his Alister Clark Stakes
form of a week earlier quite correct by
leading throughout the third Federal
Handicap and winning from Operatic
and Royal Peter. He was the second leg
of a winning double for his apprentice
rider, D. Walker, who had won earlier
on Huntingdale.
Results at Rosehill did not affect Syd-
ney Cup betting to any extent apart
from Lambeth’s price hardening. Beau
Vite won the Autumn Stakes in a
way that suggested he would be at the
top of his form next Saturday, but sight
must not be lost of the fact that he will
be meeing Veiled Threat 181 b., Dewar
111 b., Dashing Cavalier 51b. and Pantler
291 b. worse. Only for the shade of doubt
attaching to how he will shape over two
miles, Veiled Threat’s second would have
caused his price to have shortened more
than is the case.
Beau Vite beat him decisively, but at
the winning post Veiled Threat was no
further behind that horse than at the top
of the straight, and McCarten did not
get the last ounce out of him when he
saw there was no chance of winning. A
concession of 181 b. for a beating is some-
thing substantial, and Veiled Threat is
more favorably weighted than when he
seventh last year with 7.12. Unless
it should be Pantler he looks like again
getting home ahead of those he beat in
the Autumn Stakes. In finishing last
Pantler did not show Cup form, but a
drop from 9.3 to 7.10 will make a lot of
difference to him.
Dewar may run well, but I still think
he has his share in 9.0. It’s Funny goes
up to 8.2 for his St. Leger, which should
dispose of him. He will be meeting
Lambeth 211 b. worse, and the latter,
being a lightly-built customer, will be
much better suited by 6.9 than he was by
8.10. He and Wellesley read best of
those with less than 7.7. At exactly that
weight Fearless Fox may be a possibility.
He will meet Angus 141 b. better than in
the City Handicap. Velocity did not
impress in the Autumn Stakes, and
though the longer distance will give
Beaulivre plenty of time to settle down
the last bit may find him wanting.
Against this it must be remembered that
he was fifth with 9.6 in the 1940 Mel-
bourne Cup, and Rosehill may not be as
difficult a two-mile course as Flemington.
Pander’s Autumn Stakes run said
nothing in his favor, but I shall still
have him on my side, with Veiled Threat,
Beau Vite and Lambeth to supply at
least another place-getter.
Bangster seems the only addition of
note to those likely to run in the
Champagne Stakes. He beat Hall Stand
in the Breeders’ Plate, but, conceding the
latter weight, he finished behind him on
two subsequent occasions. Each has 71b.
penalty this time, and going upon the
manner in which Hall Stand won the
Sires’ Produce Stakes Bangster’s chance
of downing him is not bright. The
shorter distance will help Hesione, but
as Hall Stand had her measure two fur-
longs from home on Saturday, and she
has 101 b, penalty, it is difficult to give
her bright prospects of turning the tables
on the chestnut.
* * * *
High Caste ran such a good race in the
Doncaster that he reads like winning the
All-Aged Plate. He goes up for sale on
Friday, but that does not dispose of the
possibility of his being a runner, even if
he is sold. Applying handicap figures,
he has a pull over everything else en-
gaged. Yaralla strikes me as likely to
be his most dangerous opponent, if his
St. Leger run did him no harm. At a dis-
tance that will suit him he has 8.6. Rim-
veil’s Doncaster effort was not impres-
sive, but though Mildura’s Melbourne
form was poor he has done well since in
his work. A return to the form that
enabled him to win the Doncaster with
9.3 would make him a formidable oppo-
nent for anything else engaged. At the
time of writing it is probable Beaulivre
will be a Cup runner, and if High Caste
is beaten I think it will be by Yaralla.

Sydney Cup betting was quiet on Mon-
day, when the order of the most-fancied
horses was as follows:
Beau Vite.
Pantler.
Lambeth.
Dashing Cavalier, Velocity, Veiled
Threat.
It’s Funny, Dewar.

H. Wragg, who, with 69 wins, was the
leading jockey in England last season,
joined the Royal Artillery last July. As
he rode at 21 meetings out of a possible
30 after joining, his military and race-
course duties did not clash to any extent.
Perhaps it will be the same with some
Australian jockeys who are likely to be
in the call-up.

A Queensland correspondent wishes to
know whether I can put him in touch
with any Melbourne or Sydney trainer —
the bigger the better —who is prepared to
supply him with possibilities for future
races. Sorry I cannot oblige, though,
unless rumor greatly exaggerates, there
are trainers, as well as a few jockeys,
with punting clienteles sufficiently large
to warrant envy on the part of any
circularising tipster.

Yattendon won the first Sydney Cup in
3.43, and The Barb did 3.40 when he won
his second Cup with 10.8, The best for
the race was 3.31 until Wakeful (9.7) put
up 3.28 in 1902. Tartan cut that record
down to 3.27 in 1905, and when Kenna-
quhair won in 1920 with 9.5, defeating
Poitrel, his time was 3.22}. Gwillian G.
knocked a quarter-second off that in
1930, and the record is now Lucrative’s
3.20} of last year.

According to the “Horse and Hound,”
yearlings sold in England and Ireland
last year totalled 564. The greatest num-
ber sold by any sire was 14 —Dastur
(Solario-Friar’s Daughter) and Loaning-
dale (Colorado-Perfection) each having
that total. They respectively averaged
214gns. and 44gns. Fairway made an
average of 1067gns. for six,

Compared with prize-money prior to
the war there has been a big drop in
added money for this year’s English
classic races. The Derby carries £2OOO,
St. Leger £l5OO, Oaks £lOOO, Two Thou-
sand Guineas £lOOO and One Thousand
£7OO. The word “New” goes before the
name of each race and entries totalled:
Derby 56, Oaks 59, St. Leger 72, Two
Thousand 43 and One Thousand 54. It
is announced in the “Racing Calendar”
that the races mentioned can be run on
any racecourse selected by the stewards
of the Jockey Club and on any date sub-
sequent to and within 28 days of the ad-
vertised date.
Len Dawson (11-12), a Rugby League
footballer, proved to be a better than
ordinary boxer when he clashed with Ern
Clingan (11.2) at Leichhardt Stadium. To
the end of the third round he led on
points (Clingan lost the third, being
cautioned for landing a low left); but
after that Clingan’s class prevailed, and
a nicely-timed right to the chin put Daw-
son to bye-bye in the sixth. Clingan gave
the impression that he is the best middle-
weight now in Australia. He is claiming
the championship, which is supposed to
be vacant. In a supporting match Nev
Wicks (9.12), winner of the lightweight
Silver Belt tournament at Leichhardt,
was knocked out by Jackie Moore (9.12)
in the fourth.

No Cushy Job.
“Civilians will have their faces measured
before they are issued with respirators by the
N.E.S.”
With some misgivings I had agreed to
become warden of the Bubbly Court
Flats. My worst fears were realised
when I discovered there were about 300
windows, of which at least 274 shone like
beacons during our first blackout.
Since the brownouts began I have a
regular routine. After dark I walk out
into the street, look up and select the
most brilliantly glaring window. Then
I tear up four flights of stairs, only to
find that the Berghoffs, who had fled
penniless from Vienna and who pay £6
a week, are out and their place in dark-
ness.
Down again, another look from a dif-
ferent angle, and I decide it was old
Nicholls on the third floor. Nicholls I
find in his kitchenette, and he swears
he was never in his lounge-room. And
so it goes on all night.
When the Chief Warden told me to
measure up Bubbly Court’s strange col-
lection of dials for respirators I felt like
offering myself to the High Command
as a human torpedo, but the C.W. added
to his own strong vocal persuasions some
extra potent stuff he had got at “Swiss”
Dick’s joint. The next thing I was dimly
aware of was setting off on a phiz inven-
tory with tape measure, callipers and
notebook.
I began at flat 14. In answer to my
ring Berghoff brought his face to the
door.
“Well, Bergy, old frankfurt,” I said,
“if you’ll stop swaying about for a
minute I’d like to calculate the circum-
ference of your moosh.”
Berghoff looked blank. “I nodt onner-
stan’ vodt you means, don’t dey?”
“No, isn’t it! Now listen, Adolph.
Can’t you compree plain English? Just
push your pan forward while I find out
whether the area from your conk to your
trap and where your cheekbones used to
be form an isosceles triangle.”
I whipped the callipers out of my hip
pocket. Berghoff, his fat face showing
alarm, drew back and slammed the door,
and from somewhere within I heard a
ring and then a voice saying “Pudt me
on to pliss, plizz.”
Annoyed at the stupidity of foreigners,
I tried the next flat. Mrs. Wilkie, fat,
fortyish and, according to the other flat-
dwellers, a fair cow, opened the door,
and as soon as she saw the notebook
began automatically her ritual, “You
can whistle for any instalments today,”
when I broke in with “I’m the warden.”
The lady bristled instantly. “Why
can’t you leave him alone? He hasn’t
been in clink now for three months”
I explained I was the N.E.S. warden.
“I have come to measure your husband
up,” I said.
“What are y’ maggin’ about? He
isn’t stiff yet!”
I told her I referred to his face, for
a respirator. “Well, he’s on it,” she said ;
“but y’ can give it a go,” and she led
me into the bedroom.
I succeeded in measuring a mass of
facial convulsions surrounded by an aura
of plonk. As Wilkie was likely to be in
that state for several weeks I took meas-
urements for two masks —one to wear
while he was only grinding his teeth and
another one for when his face, of a
different shape then altogether, was react-
ing to the attacks of assorted animals,
Mrs. Wilkie coyly asked me if I was
going to measure her face, but I told her
her dial was “standard.” I didn’t say
I referred to lamp-standard— -i.e., one
that is broader at the base than at the
top, and of about the same size.
Old Nicholls aggressively demanded to
know what I was getting out of it. After
half an hour’s argument he grudgingly
consented to be measured, but was
adamant in refusing to have his teeth in.
In vain I pointed out that with his
nose jammed against his chin inside a
respirator he would smother. He de-
veloped an acute persecution complex,
swore it was a plot to get rid of him,
and told me with a wealth of detail what
I could do with the respirator when it
came.
Slapdash, the commercial artist in the
adjoining flat, was next. He affects a
Vandyke beard. I couldn’t measure him,
beard and all, as I had strict orders for
only faces, but obviously his beard would
have to go inside his mask with him. So
first I measured his face, parting the hair
as best I could. Then by multiplying
the herbage area by the width of “nap
by the length of staple I arrived at the
cubic footage, which, added to the face,
gave the grand total. By my reckoning
his respirator and that of the Zoo hippo,
should be interchangeable.
Some of the men with water-wing ears
and seven chins were hard to do, but,
generally, the women were the worst
trying to measure jaws which were aver-
aging 240 w.p.m. called for an eagle eye
and lightning measuring. . .
The last one I called on was Maisie,
the barmaid with the canary-colored locks
in Flat 2. She caused me no trouble at
all —in fact, her co-operation was admir-
able. Then the wife walked in.
Did I say Maisie caused me trouble at

Twenty Per Cent. Absent
It has been comfortably supposed by
both ourselves and our allies that Aus-
tralia enjoys greater freedom from sabot-
age and fifth-column risks than most
nations. Unfortunately, an earnest cry
against an astounding proportion of
absenteeism in war factories in Victoria
(it is safe to assume that the sin is not
confined to one State) shows that there
is an insidious form of unintentional
sabotage going on all the time.
There are two ugly aspects to the evil
—the continuous and irretrievable loss
of output and the psychological factors
implied. How serious this is is shown by
figures quoted in a letter published by
the “Age,” soberest of Australian dailies
and one whose devotion to Australia
cannot be questioned: 328 employees,
representing 20 per cent, of the total
strength, in one Government munitions
factory alone were absent from work on
one specific day. And the complainant
states that there is nothing in the nature
of the work, or the hours and conditions,
to justify absenteeism at all. Yet the
figures quoted must be far in excess of
what would be expected (or tolerated) in
civil industries in peace-time.
To my mind, the psychological out-
look indicated is even worse than the
loss of output, serious as that is. Both
the Germans and the Japanese are fight-
ing under the compulsion of some of
the most powerful motives that have
ever actuated mankind to militancy down
the ages—expansion-for-survival as they
interpret it; power-lust and ambition
on a Lucifer-like scale; a fanatical
belief in a sort of perverted “sacred”
destiny in the leadership of nations. And
if these were not enough, there is the
ultimate grim motive which they share
with the whole animal kingdom, self-
preservation from death (national defeat).
What weapons have we to oppose to
this array of motives, backed as they
are by crafty planning, staggering pre-
paredness, regimentation that pardons no
delinquency, and a seeming universal
acceptance of the utmost in personal sac-
rifice and dedication to the cause?
What is our democratic substitute for
“a sword in one hand and the Koran in
the other”? Is there any hope of in-
flaming the nation to the heights of sac-
rifice, resolve and endeavor to meet the
fury of prepared fanaticism? Or have
our drama-sodden souls grown so
numbed by the blood baths and agonies
of others that even the red tide approach-
ing our own threshold cannot eliminate
“20 per cent, absenteeism” from a vital
munitions industry?— Caer Urea (Vic.).
Speed-up Output
The Prime Minister could achieve
almost overnight a 50 per cent, increase
in production by simply introducing pay-
ment by piece rates in all industries.
Labor men wax enthusiastic on how
Russian war industries stepped-up pro-
duction by 100 per cent., but they are
cautiously silent about Stalin throwing
overboard socialist go-slow ideas and
adopting capitalist methods to hasten
his preparations to meet Hitler. What
a paradox! The socialist State borrows
capitalist ideas to speed-up its output,
while the capitalist State employs social-
ist methods and keeps its output slowed
down.
Our workers, fast, slow or otherwise,
get the same wages. There is no incen-
tive to increase output and very little to
exercise good workmanship. Is it to be
wondered that, in munition works, raw
newchums fired with patriotic zeal often
double the output of laggards who have
been on the job for months? Is it to be
wondered that workmanship is too often
faulty when, good or bad workmanship,
the wage is always the same? —K. Me.
(N.S.W.).
General MacArthur
While the flapper press is going into
ecstasies about General MacArthur’s
appointment let me be sane and view
it dispassionately.
Taking the dull side of the slate, Mac-
Arthur is not a miracle-worker. Neither
he nor any other man can do the work
assigned him without adequate support.
The mere mention of his name is not
going to send the Japs scurrying to their
burrows. About 18 months back he was
sent to put the Philippines in a prepared
state to meet the Jap invasion. He may
have been hampered by politicians in the
U.S., but the Japs got there. His defence
of the Bataan, while worthy of all praise,
must be placed in its proper perspective
—good work under ideal conditions for
the defender.
The other side of the slate. He is a
popular hero at the moment, and his
name gives a good moral uplift. That
can be placed at its proper value ; but
the real value of his appointment is that
he knows the worth of political interfer-
ence ; he is in a position to say to our
fuddling gasbags, “Stand aside; make
records for the A.B.C. if you wish, but
don’t interfere with me.” That in itself
is one of the greatest victories yet won
in this war. —H. G. L. (Q.).
Cut off from the civilian world by the
self-contained life of a military camp, it
is hard for us to gauge the public’s re-
action to the appointment of General
MacArthur as Supreme Commander. But
there is no doubt in the world what the
man in camp thinks of it. One and all
hail it as the end of the red-tape which
has been throttling the soldier’s en-
thusiasm and initiative.
Here is the sort of thing which
gives thousands of men a contempt for
army administration. A soldier who re-
quires a new hat must make written appli-
cation to his company commander and
produce the hat for inspection. If the
“Military call-ups have just atom ruined this orchestra, John."
C.C. approves he marks the application
and sends it to the commanding officer
of the regiment for approval. If the C.O.
approves he endorses a request to the
Q.M.S. Store to issue the new hat!
Two fighting officers, trained to lead
men into battle, wasting precious time
over a private’s hat. None of us believes
that the defender of the Philippines will
stand for that. — Smilax (Q.).
Churchill
“E.I.Si” (B. 18 / 3 / ’42), like a great many
others, accepts the newspaper valuation of
Mr. Churchill, and also Mr. Chamberlain
—one would think that Mr. Chamberlain
had never been heard of until he be-
came Prime Minister, and that his
Administration consistently neglected de-
fence. Actually, he was Chancellor of
the Exchequer in the Baldwin Govern-
ment, and it was he who introduced the
Budget which provided for a measure
of rearmament. Under present-day
standards it was ridiculously small, but
it has to be examined by 1936 standards.
It raised a storm of opposition through-
out the country. The “Daily Herald,”
which claimed on April 27, 1936, the
largest daily net sale in the world, came
out that day with an editorial claiming
that “Mr. Chamberlain’s makeshift pro-
posals” had “failed to rally any substan-
tial measure of support in the country” ;
that it was feared the Budget was only a
prelude to others placing still heavier
burdens upon the taxpayer. “Unless
opposition is alert and sustained there
is a danger that the abnormal expendi-
ture on arms will, in the near future, eat
into that required for the maintenance
of our essential social services. Mr. Win-
ston Churchill rightly pointed out last
week that these social services have
greatly added to national strength. But
it is difficult to rely on Mr. Chamberlain
as a Chancellor who will put up a seri-
ous fight for our beneficent social insti-
tutions against the demands of the fight-
ing services.”
It would be dangerous to deduce from
a single quoted remark that Mr. Churchill
opposed rearmament, but he is quoted
approvingly by the opposition—F. H. W.
(S.A.).
“E. 1.5.” challenges the propriety and
the truth of The Bulletin’s criticism of
a man whose military miscalculations in
two wars have cost Australia more than
50,000 casualties, killed, wounded and
missing. He also claims immunity from
blame for Churchill on the ground that
the neglect of previous Governments “has
been responsible for our disasters from
Norway to Singapore.”
But Churchill’s misadventures are all
of a piece, and none of his predecessors
in office can be blamed for the gambles
of Antwerp and Gallipoli or the ridicu-
lous expeditions against the Russians
in 1919-20 or Churchill’s ill-judged oppo-
sition to the India Act. As for the rest
of the disasters, if the shortcomings of
predecessors were a valid reason for the
invariable failure of the matter in hand,
all enterprise would be doomed before-
hand.
It is the magic touch of greatness that
transmutes the material of failure into
the fabric of success. Churchill has
proved that he lacks this touch, so it is
neither wise nor patriotic to incite him
to further disaster by the silence that
seems to give consent. As for the claim
that “Churchill stands out as a tower
among the horde of mediocrities,” so docs
Hitler, so does Mussolini, so does De
Valera, so did Mr. Lang and Mr. Theo-
dore. There are towers and towers. —
J. W. R. (Tas.).
Use for State Parliament
The National Security Regulations are
daily taking away more and more of the
legislation which would be passed in
ordinary times by the State Parliaments.
It is not often that the Victorian State
Parliament is in session, and when dual
taxation is abolished and a few more
National Security Regulations are pro-
mulgated the sessions, if any, will be
very brief.
It seems a pity that such a fine build-
ing in Melbourne as Parliament House
should be idle when there is a shortage
of hospital accommodation. This build-
ing would make an ideal temporary hos-
pital, and, if it is necessary for the State
Parliament to meet, the few members
who will be available after the next man-
power call-up could be accommodated
in the Premier’s office. —D. R. (Vic.).
New Order?
The British Labor party makes a great
parade of its devotion to democracy and
abhorrence of totalitarianism, yet it de-
clares that “a planned society must
replace the old competitive system,”
Whatever its virtues, a planned society
is incompatible with democracy. For
such a regime to function effectively it
must be authoritative. It cannot be re-
conciled with individual freedom and the
right to criticise and oppose the Gov-
ernment. This means the end of liberty
of political association and of the press
—the cornerstones of the system we call
democracy.
The moulders of British Labor policy
seem to be very muddle-headed. — Tom
(N.S.W.).
Social Justice
So Mr. Ward “would like to give the
people of Australia what they have never
had —social justice” (B. 18/2/’42). It
would be interesting to know what the
Federal Minister of Labor considers
social justice.
Australia’s State education departments
provide free education right to the uni-
versity, and numerous scholarships and
evening classes assure the clever child of
poor parents and the ambitious worker
the opportunity of a university education.
Hours of labor, save for the man on the
land, are limited by law, and only the
work-shy would declare them unreason-
able. Wages are fixed by impartial
tribunals, and there is a minimum wage
calculated to keep a married pair and
one child in decency and dignity. Child
endowment*is available to every mother
tor all children other than the first and
is payable till the child is 16.
There are various other social services,
not least of which is a generous old-age-
pension system which, unlike most simildr
schemes in other parts of the world, is
non-contributory. All forms of industry
receive protection from foreign competi-
tion, and some classes of primary pro-
ducers get further help, either through
direct subsidy or fixed prices above
world parity. Further, though those
in receipt of less than £8 a week
enjoy 70 p.c. of personal incomes,
they pay only a small proportion
of direct taxation; many nothing at
all. There are neither legal obstacles nor
social handicaps to prevent any Austra-
lian attaining the highest positions in any
sphere. Many of Australia’s leaders in
all fields, both in the past and today,
were reared in humble homes.
In few, if any, countries is there less
disparity in wealth than in Australia,
both the very rich and the “submerged
tenth” being few in number. If all that
doesn’t constitute social justice, what
does? — Lyle (N.S.W.).
Russia
“J.W.R.” (B. 18/3/’42) apparently be-
lieves that the British Government, in
sending equipment and supplies to Russia,
did so with some quixotic idea of prefer-
ring her need to our own. That, of
course, is totally wrong. Russia is not
fighting Germany to save us, nor are we
helping Russia because of any notions
of chivalry. We are aiding Russia be-
cause she is a more vital defence line
to the Empire as a whole than even Sin-
gapore and the N.E.I. Had Hitler over-
run south Russia last year, then it is very
probable that he would now possess the
oilfields of Iraq and Iran, and would be
threatening to effect a junction with the
Japanese through India.
And what of the Suez Canal? We
cannot expect Australia to be placed first
when the assessment of the Empire’s war
strategy is made. I humbly venture the
opinion that the maintenance of Russia
has been a greater victory for the Allied
cause than the fall of Singapore and of
Java has been a disaster.—E. I. S. (Q.).
The Wool Levy
Woolgrowers in Australia should not
have to pay the levy of 6d. per bale for
research and publicity. The charge is
fixed by Commonwealth legislation, but
there is little opportunity for either re-
search or publicity and woolgrowers’
returns are being reduced by higher taxa-
tion, contributions to war loans and
rising costs.
Publicity for extended use of wool is
futile at present. Britain has purchased
the entire Australian clip for the dura-
tion of the war and one wool year after-
wards, and woollen apparel is rationed
in both Britain and the United States.
Former buyers of Australian wool are
now enemies or are under enemy domi-
nation. Funds could be accumulated for
future use, but that is far from essential
as things are today. Research may pro-
ceed, but most of the research workers
are engaged on work of much greater im-
portance.
Another argument in favor of suspen-
sion of the levy is that war-damage
insurance works out at 6d. a bale. If
the research and publicity levy was sus-
pended for the duration of the war, the
relief would offset this cost at least. —
Two Strand (N.S.W.).
Air-raid Tests
Victorian A.R.P. officials are getting a
bit sick of surprise air-raid tests, and
Mr. Dunstan is inclined to agree with
them. Sydney’s Mr. Heffron may have
let one off by the time this appears, and
a lot of his victims are getting sick of
it, too. Not only are people beginning
to respond as a former people dnce did
to the boy who cried “Wolf!” but the
dislocation of work and business is an-
noying. Wardens, for their part, are
confident of their own local preparations
and can’t help wondering if the “heads”
are so sure of themselves. —O. T.
(N.S.W.).
