LEADS THE WAY
The Red Page
New Forms
Chief among the manifestations of in-
tellectual power is the capacity to aban-
don traditional methods of expression.
The English have always had it. From
Chaucer to Aldous Huxley, they have
produced a succession of literary Brad-
mans; writers, mostly young, who have
experimented successfully in revolution-
ary forms. Here are two novels either
of which, if it had been written in Aus-
tralia, would have aroused more excite-
ment than Lindrum’s largest break or
Grimmett’s finest bowling feat. They
don’t attract much attention in England ;
the establishment of records of the sort
is taken for granted there.
In Reverse
In The Woman She Was (Cassell;
Angus and' Robertson ; 7s. 6d.), Lance
Sieveking, poet and satirist, traces the his-
tory of a famous woman painter from
death to birth. There is a startlingly
funny epilogue in the shape of bromidic
press appreciations, written after the
heroine’s death, and inspired by smug
relatives who had been scandalised by
her unconventional ways. They show
the world the kind of woman she was
not. Anyhow, Mr. Sieveking doesn’t
think she was that kind of woman.
This writer is probably a hurried
worker; he is satisfied to find out a few
queer facts' about a given period, and
trust to them to supply the atmosphere
he wants. He mentions that at one
stage of the Victorian era it was fashion-
able to give words Russian endings in
colloquial conversation, while at another
stage they were given Italian endings;
and when Theodore, Charlotte’s husband,
does it a picture of him, his dress, men-
tality and social outlook is immediately
created. But there are no references to
the highly significant vogue-words of the
late ’nineties, such as “deevie,” or of the
two or three years that followed, such
as “twencent” ; the fin-de-siecle bicyclists
talk modern English.
This is Mr. Sieveking’s weakest period.
Though Charlotte knew Sargent and
Wilde intimately, we are told little or
nothing of the worlds in which they
moved; and Wilde’s downfall, every
stage of which was blazoned in the even-
ing papers to the unspeakable distress
of his friends, is dismissed in a few
lines. Mr. Sieveking isn’t strong on
accuracy either. He writes of the Row
“thick with riders, galloping!”
However, Charlotte atones for every-
thing ; she is a magnificent creation. He
seems to have known her in her old
age. This may account for the impec-
cable moral character which he gives
her; there are old ladies who, though
gay enough in their time, create an im-
pression that they could never have
sipned. Speaking personally, the writer
found it impossible to swallow the youth-
ful Charlotte’s almost imbecile ignorance
of the meaning of Rossetti’s behavior to-
wards her.
The most interesting, informed and
ironic part of the book is the account
of the share Charlotte took in the fight
for woman’s rights. She was eminently
sane. On one side of her excellent brain
she must have known that the agitation
was futile, that the vote wouldn’t give
women in general—working women as
distinguished from women like Lady
Astor, M.P.—a single asset worth having.
On the other side, she was one of those
cranks who are always to be found
clamoring and suffering for silly causes.
There is usually a personal reason. In
her case it was resentment against Man,
inspired by one man’s treatment of her
daughter.
Warbeck, the seducer, with his top-
hat, stick, buckled opera-cloak and
moustache, his silky manners and un-
speakable villainy, is almost too trans-
pontine to be true ; but he comes to life
in one scene anyhow—that in which
Charlotte orders him to die. Many
famous people appear—Swinburne and
Watts-D unton;
Renoir and the
Impressionists of
his day; Mrs.
Pankhurst and
other leaders of
the Votes - for -
Women campaign—but Charlotte is the
only person who really matters. She
deserved a longer book.
Apart from its value as a character
study and a quick sketch of upper
middle-class life in England during the
past three-quarters of a century, The
Woman She Was has humor and a style
from which every superfluous word has
been cut out.
Rome Through a Future Emperor’s Eyes
Robert Graves— also an ironist and
perhaps the greatest of the surviving war
poets—has written in I, Claudius (Arthur
Baker; Bs.) a novel about the heyday
of the Roman Empire in the form of
an autobiography. Claudius was an ideal
choice for his purpose. This cripple, who
was regarded as a half-wit by members
of his family, yet lived to do almost as
much for Rome as Augustus himself,
was as great an enigma to his generation
as he is to ours. Tacitus and Suetonius
are responsible for nearly all we know
about him. Both preferred colorful
stories to the truth, and he was dead
before they were born. Mr. Graves has
gone for many of his episodes to the
“Annals” (in point of fact, no important
source of information seems to have
been overlooked), but as regards the
character of Claudius he has relied largely
on imagination. He puts forward a
Claudius who may conceivably have
existed—a benevolent, whimsical invalid
with a passion for learning and a pre-
tended inferiority complex—and shows
how the Empire looked to him when it
stretched from Babylon to Scotland, and
from the Nile to the Danube.
An advantage of assuming that
Claudius, during most of his life, took
little or no part in the activities of the
world which he observed so closely is
that it enables the author to give the
alleged autobiographist a judicial out-
look. We get an apparently frank picture
of this enormous and brilliant society
done by one who was in the middle of
it —rather as though the Prince of Wales
had conscientiously written down all he
knows or has heard about the social, poli-
tical, military and naval problems and
scandals of present-day London.
Livia, Augustus’s widow, mother of
his successor, Tiberius, and grandmother
of Claudius, is the chief villainess. Yet
her greatness is admitted. Germanicus,
Claudius’s elder brother and idol, is the
hero. The descriptions of his campaigns
against the German are in modern mili-
tary idioms, and the soldiers talk, think
and behave like modern soldiers. Here
we get our first glimpse of Caligula, who
went to the wars with his father Ger-
manicus, was regarded as a mascot by
the other ranks, and was a malignant
criminal almost before he had emerged
from babyhood.
Claudius is depicted as an adept at
what Continentals call “Englishman’s
brag.” He keeps protesting that he is
by no means a brave or clever fellow.
Obviously, however, in order to survive
the blood-baths of the last ten years of
Tiberius’s reign, and of practically the
whole of Caligula’s reign, it was neces-
sary for him to be both ; and towards
the end he sometimes lets us see just
how shrewd and intrepid he was. It is
a masterly study psychologically and
(though so much is imagined) historically.
The end comes with Claudius’s acces-
sion. If the story had covered a few
more hours we would have had our first
clear view of his real character. Almost his
first administrative act was to authorise
the execution of Cassius Chserea, the
dauntless veteran of the German wars
who had earned the gratitude of the
Empire by exterminating Caligula.

From the People
Through the Banks
To the Farmers
T~\ EPOSITS lodged by the thrifty of the community
with the trading banks are the main source of the
money available to farmers and other producers.
This money, together with that subscribed by bank
shareholders and the bank reserves built up out of
the profits of prosperous years, forms the principal
reservoir from which funds can be drawn for the
development of the resources of the country and the
financing of wool, wheat, butter and other products
shipped overseas.
By this flow—from the people, through the banks,
to the farmers—the savings of the depositors in the
banks are effectively employed. Thus the basis of
our financial system is the savings of the people.
Depositors, banks and producers are so closely
related and their interests so intimately bound
together, that any factor that affects one affects all.

Buchman, an American theological lec-
turer, it penetrated to Oxford in 1921.
A meeting held last year in the House
of Commons is said to have been at-
tended by nearly a third of the members,
The movement has no theology and
no opinions on social questions. Nor is
it sectarian. Its object is to remake the
individual and enable him to find a
deeper spiritual life within his own
Church. Individual unhappiness and in-
effectiveness, it claims, together with sex
and inferiority complexes, are rooted in
selfishness and sin. To overcome selfish-
ness we must “share” with others our
interior spiritual life, our highest aspira-
tions and our sins and temptations. To
rob sin of its terrors we must publicly
confess it. So Groups (meetings, house
parties) are formed and public confes-
sions made. The mind, now humbled, is
prepared to receive the guidance of God,
Who will rebuild the character.
“Sharing” and “life-changing” under
the special “guidance” of Christ are
essential elements of Buchmanism ; and
the neophyte is not recognised as com-
pletely changed till he has made at least
one convert to the Groups.
The volume is made up of essays by
Groupist leaders and by senior members
of the university, lay and clerical,
Catholic, Anglican and Nonconformist,
The lay critics examine the social and
educational effects of the movement in
the university ; the clerics guardedly
ask whether it will remain within the
Church or establish itself as a new
foundation.
Buchmanism is denounced in Modern
Knowledge and Old Beliefs, by Vivian
Phelips (Watts and Co., London ; Is.).
He quotes the Bishop of Durham: “The
darkest shadow on the movement is the
trail of moral and intellectual wrecks
which its progress leaves behind” ; and
he adds, “Oxford is not responsible, nor
ever has been, for the depraved antics
of these spiritual exhibitionists.”
But then Mr. Phelips is a typical
Rationalist, ruthlessly attacking all forms
of theism, adducing all the usual argu-
ments to demonstrate that no well-in-
formed person could possibly believe in
the existence of a personal God.
What raises his book above most of
its kind is its searching inquiry into the
“Faith of the Modern Churchman.” He
claims that many resort to mental reser-
vations when repeating the creeds, and
in their public utterances use expressions
to which they assign meanings other than
the literal. They seem deliberately to
mislead their people lest they admit too
much, the alternative being to resign and
join the ranks of the unemployed.
Bishop Barnes, Dean Inge and Canon
Streeter are quoted extensively, and the
conclusion drawn from their utterances
is that they believe that the Deity of
Christ, the Resurrection and allied doc-
trines need no longer be taken seriously
by Christians.
Two recent Australian publications,
both from Angus and Robertson, namely,
The Creeds and the Living Church, by
Dr. Kenneth Edward, and Doctrines
Living and Dead, by the Rev. John
Edwards, confirm his opinion. These
contributions to the Angus controversy
deny practically everything that institu-
tional Christianity has stood for in the
past. Dr. Edward, for example, agrees
with Dr. Angus that the Saviour was no
God, but a man with a man’s capacity
for sin; and that He is, therefore, not a
member of what the Christian Churches
understand by the Trinity. Yet Dr.
Edward is no Unitarian.
“Unitarianism” serves the guardian of
dogmatism very often in exactly the same
way as the Bogey Man used to serve in-
competent nurses —to frighten children
into obedience.
Boiled down, the message of these
clergymen appears to be that we should

all try to be as good as the Saviour was,

Jane Austen
Dent and Sons have just issued Emma
and Mansfield Park in their 55.-a-volume
Vox edition of Jane’s work. When are
they coming to “Love and Friendship”?
This delightful book, though written over
a century ago, was published for the first
time in 1923. Virginia Woolf says in
my edition:
That astonishing and unchildlikc story
was written apparently to amuse the
school r00m.... yet nothing is more obvious
than that Jane was writing for everybody;
for nobody; for our age; for her own.
One hears it in the rhythm, and shapeli-
ness, and severity of her sentences.
Take these excerpts on the swooning
habit. Are they not gibes at the real
thing rather than satires on foolish
writers?
Never did I see such an affecting scene
as the meeting of Edward and Augustus.
Jt was too affecting for the feelings of
Sophia and myself—-we fainted alternately
on the sofa.
Again, when they heard that the bailiffs
were to he put in:
Ah, what could we do but what we did?
We sighed and fainted on the sofa.
(Note the pleasing proximity of the
sofa. Throughout the book no swoon is
accomplished without a sofa, an arm-
chair or a strong pair of arms about.)
Later, when the newly-claimed grand-
father abruptly leaves the room, “we in-
stantly fainted in each other’s arms,”
and again, when the husband did not
arrive at the time expected, “we could
not support the disappointment, we could
only faint.”
The crowning gibe at swooning is put
into Sophia’s mouth on her deathbed.
My beloved Laura, take warning from
my unhappy end, and avoid the impru-
dent conduct which has occasioned it.
Beware of fainting fits. Though at the
time they may be refreshing and agree-
able, yet, believe me, they will in the end,
if too often repeated, prove destructive to
your constitution. One fatal swoon has
cost me my life. A frenzy fit is not one
quarter so pernicious; it is an exer-
cise to the body, and, if not too violent, is,
I daresay, conducive to health. Run mad
as often as you chuse, but do not faint.
“It was;” the author goes on, “her
dying advice to her afflicted Laura, who
has ever most faithfully adhered to it.”
Jane’s love of poking fun was in-
satiable. She tells of some people who,
when visiting Scotland, had much time
on their hands, for they were acquainted
with few people, “knowing only the Mac-
leods, the Mackenzies, the Macphersons,
the Macartneys, the Macdonalds, the
Mackinnons, the Maclellans, the Mac-
kays, the Macbeths and the Macduffs.”
There are priceless incidents, among
them the knocking on the door of the Uske
Vale Cottage, the finding of the grand-
father (who, though the children were the
progeny of his own sons and daughters,
had never heard of them before).
“Tell me,” he said, looking fearfully to-
wards the door after having been
accosted four separate times by so many
unknown grandchildren, “tell me, have
I any other grandchildren in the inn?”
The life story of the cousins Augustus
and Philander is also inimitable. They
were touring the country playing Mac-
beth, “in which,” Augustus narrates, “the
manager always plays Banquo himself,
his wife, my Lady Macbeth, I did the
three witches, and Philander acted all
the rest.”
One may perhaps be reminded of “The
Young Visiters,” but whereas the latter
emphasises the innocence and ignorance
of the writer, “Love and Friendship”
plays on the gullibility of the reader.
MADELINE BUCK.
“A Gentleman Never Tells”
This realistic study by Mr. J. J. Mulli-
gan, a Sydney society man, of fashion-
able life in England comes as a delightful
surprise to one who, like myself, has
given years of faithful service to the
British nobility and gentry. P. R.
Stephensen is the publisher, and the price
is 6s.
The hero is Lord Gerrard Fitzgerald,
only son of an earl. Distasteful though
it be, I am constrained, as what I may
call an inevitable authority on heraldry,
to begin my appreciation with an objec-
tion. “Lord Gerrard” is not the title of
the only son of an earl, but of the
younger son of a marquis or duke. As
heir to an earldom his lordship would
have been a viscount. Similarly, the
West End mansion of Sir Park Tolling-
ton, father of Lord Gerrard’s fiancee,
Elise, is said to be in “Carlton Terrace,
Pall Mall.” There is no such address.
I would hesitate to draw attention to
these mistakes, but they are growing in-
creasingly common with the commend-
able interest which is being shown by
loyal Australian litterateurs in Mayfair.
I have been distressed to observe that
Sydney “Sun” and “Telegraph,” with a
persistence in error comparable to that of
the mate of the lugger in the old Border
ballad, always spell Savile Row with
two Ts.”
Lord Gerrard, who “had been talked
about as a song-writer and as a play-
wright, by reason of his clever comedy
entitled ‘Daisy Doesn’t Do,’ ” is first en-
countered at breakfast in his flat.
He was clothed in exquisite pyjamas,
dressing-gown and slippers. He would have
caused the pulse of any normal girl or
woman, had she seen him then, to beat
faster than would have been good for her
peace of mind or virtuous resolutions.
But Elise was the only girl in the world
for him, and she was a worthy mate in
appearance and character. In artistic
talent, too. They had first met aboard
the P. and O. liner Rampura, where, at
a concert in aid of the Seamen’s Fund,
Elise rendered “Home, Sweet Home” so
sympathetically as to cause the women to
weep silently, and the men to blow their
noses vigorously. She, by request, then
recited “The Charge of the Light Brigade,”
and as an encore gave Kipling’s “If.”
Later, at a midnight supper in his Lon-
don mansion, Sir Park arose amidst
applause to make an announcement.
“My dear friends. To-night, or rather
this morning, I am proud to announce
that my daughter is engaged to Lord Ger-
rard Fitzgerald. It will indeed be a privi-
lege when I have the right .to call this
unspoilt sport, brilliant playwright and
English nobleman my son-in-law.”
All went well for a while. The Gala
Premiere of the nobleman’s operette
attracted the leaders of society. A “Royal
Personage came with her husband
Two of Their Majesties’ sons were
present out of compliment to their friend
Lord Gerrard.” Mr. Hannefl Swaffer
was in the stalls. As the overture came
to an end there were cries of “Wonder-
fully melodious!” “Approaches grand
opera!”
The conductor waited for silence and
then the orchestra played—to a theatre
without lights—one verse very softly of
“Silver Threads Amongst the Gold.” At
the end of the verse the curtain was slowly
raised on the first scene, and the audience
could hear the unseen singer sweetly begin
the melody of “In the Gloaming.”
The operette was a world-shaking suc-
cess. And then—misunderstandings,
separation, misery. I will reveal no
more, save that all came right in the
end.
What a faithful picture of life in the
higher cultural reaches of the Heart of
Empire! What a prophylactic against
disloyalism! The Federal Censor should
be empowered by Parliament to force
this work on every inner group in Aus-
tralia.
JEAMES.
A Satchel of Books
The stories in Wallace Q. Reid’s
Saskatoon Patrol (Wild West Club ; 7s.
6d.) are a surprisingly mild lot. Ser-
geant Mack, of the Canadian Mounted,
who figures in all of them, is far from
being a rip-roarer; he doesn’t cuss once.
His offsider, “Bull” Hicks, is more excit-
ing ; he does let fly a “d n” now and
again. Mack is efficient all the same;
he only misses his man once. In “Yellow
Jack,” the best of the yarns, he gets a
girl, too, but even then she has to ask
him.
Backwaters, by William Holt (Nichol-
son and Watson; 7s. 6d.). A ware-
house assistant is given the formula
for a preparation to strengthen leather.
It’s marketed, and he makes a fortune,
marries a society girl, but isn’t happy. He
probably never would be; he’s an ideal-
ist, and dislikes modern business
methods, so he leaves everything to the
wife and goes back to a little mill-girl
he used to know. Even then he can’t
hold a job down, and takes up Com-
munism. At the end of it he’s on the
dole. One of the few lifelike characters
in the book is the salesman who organ-
ises the leather-solution business.
The Timetable Murder, by Roger
Denbie (Nicholson and Watson ; 7s. 6d.),
is an essay in lightning detective work.
At 12.37 the negro conductor of the
Washington Limited found Lowell Wallis
dead ; he had been hanged. The evi-
dence pointed to suicide, but Dr. Quentin
Pace was on the train. It was one of
those cases in which the murderer had
invented what he thought was a perfect
alibi. Inside 23 hours the doctor had
reconstructed the entire crime in the
light of reason and named the guilty
party. Nothing much as a thriller, but
a most brilliant effort as a brain-teaser.
The hero of Too, Dangerous to Live,
by David Hume (Collins ; 7s. 6d.), is one
of those imperishable sleuths who are
bashed, shot at and tied up by the opposi-
tion in chapter after chapter, yet survive
to vindicate justice. The hero’s prey is
also a familiar character —a sufferer from
“cacoethes scribendi.” The mysterious
“Mr. Wills” fairly bombards Scotland
Yard with insulting letters. It would
have been a more enjoyable work to read,
if the ’tecs and their friends hadn’t l
talked Hollywood so persistently. Mr.
Hume should know, of course, but it
doesn’t sound like the London this critic
knew a few years ago.
The chief character in Percy Cogger’s
Flyin' Blind (Cassell; 7s. 6d.) is Joan
Delaney, who, with her small son, dashes
to Pamba, on the African coast, in search
of her drink-sodden husband. His death
and the sight of a negro woman with a
baby who resembles him give her an
appalling shock. Five years later we find
her in Sydney, where she has earned her-
self the title of “Hard-boiled Joan.”
Peter Dane loves her, but, on hearing
that she “does not trust two men in this
world,” leaves for London. Eventually
Joan, who is not so hard boiled as Sydney
thought, follows. There is a kind of
general post in which all the surviving
characters participate, as also do a famous
airman and his sister. Wedding-bells
and a few aeroplane crashes follow.
Exciting, and not altogether incredible.

THE ANTI-MOTOR CAMPAIGN.
For the last twelvemonth, at least, most
of the Sydney taxi-men have carried pas-
sengers for a shilling at flag-fall and a
shilling a mile. There are brigands who
get more (though rarely if the fare knows
the ropes), but an increasing number of
drivers has taken less. One line of cabs
has charged ninepence and ninepence ;
and even this tariff has been shaved here
and there. Of course, the downward
tendency is deplored by concerns which
sigh for the days when “Yellows” soared
to 625. 6d. and shareholders received 11 \
p.c. and a bonus issue, and it vexes the
transport bureaucracy, which sees in it
another menace to the Government trams.
Representatives of these interests met the
other day to discuss it. Next morning
it was baldly announced that they had
“agreed upon a standard fare”—a shil-
ling at flag-fall and 15 pence a mile.
No dogs or scribes were admitted to
this conference, nor did the parties in
attendance seek the opinions of the
public, which employs them both. A
spokesman for the public would have
questioned the fairness of the flag-fall
exaction —for journeys outside the city
boundaries, at all events. He would have
suggested flat rates on routes such as
Circular Quay to Central Station and
King’s Cross to both, and contended that
passengers now charged for distance
should have the alternative of paying for
time. Above all, he would have pointed
out that, since the normal post-boom
scale is a shilling a mile and one com-
pany is charging ninepence and carrying
on, it would be skinning people in cold
blood to make them pay 25 p.c. to 66 2-3
p.c. more. But the case for the public
was left to public “servants,” who are so
apt to regard themselves as the public’s
masters.
People bound for Central Station have
a particular interest in this matter of
taxi fares. If one of the multitudinous
traffic blocks caused by trams occurs
while they are on their way, they often
have to choose between hiring a car to
take them a zigzag course and missing
their train. After 8 a.m. on week-days
nearly every daylight hour brings the
spectacle of long lines of trams at a
standstill in Pitt-street and George-street,
or moving at a snail’s pace, drawing
bitter curses from passengers witn*every
jerk. It is 25 years since slow trams
running on fixed lines were exiled from the
city of London (they belonged to the
County Council, too), but they still
cumber narrow streets in the city of
vSydney, and are likely to remain there till
Doomsday if the politicians and the
Transport Commission have their way.
Their object is to drive people into these
crawling anachronisms and be hanged
to people’s preferences and convenience!
Even where the Transport Commission
has been obliged to make use of motor-
’buses, by purchase or control, it is apt
to punish people in one way or another
for patronising these newfangled notions.
Thus it costs sixpence for a ’bus ride
from Mosman to The Spit, and if the
driver is just behind a tram when starting
off he has to keep behind until the tracks
diverge, The tram-fare is twopence. It
is a shilling by ’bus from Manly to one
street beyond Cremorne Junction, a
matter of two miles ; twopence by tram
from Crow’s Nest to Lane Cove, which is
two miles and a bit. On week-days Mos-
man and Balmoral people living remote
from the tramways travel by ’bus to and
from the Musgrave-street jetty. On Sun-
days these ’buses are taken off the route,
probably because they would be too
great a convenience.
This anti-’bus policy preceded the
advent of the Transport Commission,
although made more irritating by its
jack-in-office methods. The Lang Gov-
ernment introduced it, and, in essentials,
Mr. Stevens’s Government copied Mr.
Lang’s, after people had been led to be-
lieve that it would put the ’buses back
on the roads. Ever since Mr. Lang
entered politics he has represented an
electorate in which railwaymen and
people dependent on them predominate,
and in taking from the people the rapid
and comfortable ’bus services to which
so many thousands of them had grown
accustomed he was influenced (not alto-
gether, it is admitted) by the railway and
tramway vote. Mr. Stevens also had this
in mind, no doubt, but when he pre-
served so much of the Lang policy he
was thinking more of the chronic losses
on the railways and tramways. It is
claimed that these losses have ceased as
far as the tramways are concerned,
though the trifling surplus proudly pro-
duced last year was dearly bought ; but
railway deficits threaten to last through-
out the ages.
Of course, this hostility to the motor-
’bus is not peculiar to Mr. Lang and Mr.
Stevens and the red-tape artists of the
N.S.W. Transport Commission. It
characterises politicians and bureaucrats
in all parts of Australia, and is extended
to other motor-propelled vehicles, even
aeroplanes found guilty of competing or
of being likely to compete with the rail-
ways. It is reflected in punitive taxation,
Commonwealth and State, in reactionary
enactments, regulations and administra-
tive practice, even in judgments of
superior Courts. The idea seems to be
that, since the people have been provided
by paternalistic Governments with rail-
ways and tramways, they have no busi-
ness indulging in any other form of land
transport, but should rest content with
the obsolescent and the obsolete. It is
going against nature and the genius of the
race.
Australians take to motor traction as
ducks to water. They have shown a
marked talent for mastering the intrica-
cies of internal-combustion engines, for
devising improvements on them, for
fitting them in natty vehicles and for
organising, rapidly and efficiently, ser-
vices which remove isolation and make
loneliness endurable. And nowhere in
the world are there finer car-drivers,
motor-cyclists or fliers. Apart from the
intolerable impudence involved in deny-
ing to Australians the advantages of ex-
peditious carriage of men and goods, it
is sheer folly to put obstacles in the way
of the development of such gifts. They
might conceivably be the means of saving
the nation in a perilous hour*
CHAIN STORES.
A young German came to Australia at
the beginning of the depression. He had
so little money that he carried his swag
for a time ; then he went into the agency
business, selling cheap German and
Japanese goods. A year or two later he
brought his brother from Europe. Last
year the brother was able to journey to
Leipzig for fresh novelties, and to return
with a wife and control over several new
lines. These immigrants are now on the
way to wealth. Their field is the self-
service store, which in time will become
a chain. Through their efforts the Aus-
tralian output of a factory-made article
that once had a steady market has almost
ceased, and returned-soldier toy-makers
have gone out of business.
There are other people trying to make
money by the chain-store route. Two of
them, among many hundreds, are Aus-
tralian women. The head of their house
is dead —he wore himself out fighting
drought and later fighting the Germans.
His widow and her daughter supply
knitted goods through an agent, who
feeds “nothing-over-half-a-crown” shops.
Their field is limited, since most of
such articles are machine-made. They
have to compete with foreigners—Levan-
tines and Bulgars, perhaps—with a flair
for employing girls for a few shillings
a week, and driving their cars through
Factories Acts. Anyway, the Digger’s
widow and his daughter have no car;
but they have a room, and they some-
times get a square meal.
The pitiful balance sheets of such
people are never published; but the
accounts of chain-store companies are
no mystery. One of these concerns dis-
tributed among its ordinary shareholders
25 p.c. in 1929, 30 p.c. in 1930, 25 p.c.
in 1931, 174 p.c., 224 p.c. and 25 p.c. in
succeeding years. During the depression
its net profits have grown from £22,817
to £85,552, its reserves from £5755 to
£31,000, its capital from £93,764 to
£342,000 and its assets from £210,000
to £890,000. It now has 27 stores.
Another, which has 30, has more
than doubled the number since 1929 ; it
increased its sales from £190,900 in 1924
to £2,715,699 in 1933, and has never paid
less than 10 p.c. during the depression.
But these tales of progress are in-
complete. They do not show how many
country and suburban storekeepers have
gone to the wall, nor how many Aus-
tralian factory workers and adult shop
assistants have lost their jobs in the mad
race for cheapness. Neither do they
reveal how much depreciation there has
been in the quality of the output of fac-
tories through the replacement of branded
articles with stuff on which the makers
are ashamed to put their names.
The invention of the chain store is
attributed to France, which country has
chain stores capitalised at about
£17,000,000 sterling, with an annual turn-
over of £44,000,000. It seems to regard
the child of its invention much as Franken-
stein regarded his monster. The French
have a rental tax which discriminates
against chain stores. They are also sub-
jected to a turnover tax and a special
surtax.
In Canada a Welfare Commission re-
ported that chain stores were among the
worst offenders in sweating—in some
cases the wages were so low that those
who earned them had to eke them out
with city relief.
The U.S.A. has been grappling with
the chain-store problem for years. Dis-
criminatory turnover taxes, graduated
gross sales taxes, a distribution tax on
goods in process of transfer between
wholesale house and chain store and
anti-trust legislation have all been tried.
Private efforts by independent businesses
(such as group-buying) and attempts to
secure protection by statute against
squeezed wholesale prices and the exac-
tion of unfair discounts from manufac-
turers have failed. The chains extend.
Australia’s chain-store problem is fur-
rowing the brows of storekeepers and
manufacturers. It has moved the N. S.
Wales Shop Assistants’ Union to declare
that “chain stores of the self-service type”
—no one has any legitimate complaint
against the normal store with numerous
branches —“create unemployment and
are harmful to organised Labor, because
their prices are used to lower the basic
wage in living-wage inquiries.” The
N.S.W. Government is inquiring into the
question in a half-hearted way. Since
the bigger concerns are inter-State affairs
Commonwealth action may be needed.
It is within the province of the State to set
limits on the employment of girl labor,
and, where increased protection is needed
for factory wage-payers and workers, the
Commonwealth has the required weapon
of defence.
JUNE 15 APPROACHES.
The American sense of humor is highly
developed, so Americans should enjoy
the spectacle of the nations of Europe
defaulting in their loan payments as a
joke against themselves.
No money to constitute these loans
passed between the U.S.A. and Europe.
The money borrowed in war-time was
handed to American manufacturers,
shipping cos. and farmers by the U.S.
War Industries Board, and the charge
was then debited to the allies of the
.U.S.A. The post-Armistice loans were
granted, as was made clear by the U.S.A.
Secretary to the Treasury, to allow
American businessmen to complete their
war-time contracts; “if these contracts
were suddenly cancelled,” he said, “it
would have a vitally serious effect on
American business.”
France, of course, made her debt pay-
ments dependent on reparation pay-
ments from Germany ; and when repara-
tions ceased her remittances to the U.S.A.
ceased. Germany had been borrowing
the reparations money, mainly from the
U.S.A. ; so that, when the U.S.A. stopped
lending money to Germany to pay her
debts to France, France stopped pay-
ing it back to Uncle Sam.
But this other “defaulter,” John Bull
—what’s his excuse? Well, he became
too embarrassed to pay when France
became too embarrassed to pay her debts
to him—which was when the U.S.A.
stopped reparations loans. The U.S.A.,
except for one token payment, will
accept only one medium —gold. Britain
owes the U.S.A. over 4,000,000,000 gold
dollars, and had 935,000,000 dollars’
worth of gold in March. As the Ameri-
can Government has reduced the liability
and interest rates of poor pleading
France, which owes him 3,400,000,000
gold dollars, and has 3,000,000,000 dollars
gold in reserve, its sense of fairness would
certainly not delight an Equity Judge.
Of course, both Britain and France
could pay in goods; but Uncle Sam
doesn’t want that. He wants to go on
selling cars, talkies, wheat and machinery
to debtor countries and to receive pay-
ment in specie, both for what he sells
and for what the other countries owe
him. His electors won’t let him do other-
wise.
The situation can end in only two
ways cancellation of the debts or accept-
ance ot merchandise and services in pay-
ment. In the meantime, the position is
fraught with unpleasant possibilities for
both creditor nation and debtor nations.
MILK UNDER “CONTROL.”
“Melbourne has acquired a Milk Board”
(B. 9/5/’34). Poor old Melbourne!
Sydney has had a Milk Board since
the beginning of 1932 ; it was one of Mr.
Lang’s gifts to his country. The board
is appointed for five years, and has three
members. What they may or may not
do is enshrined in many pages of the
Milk Act. The board is legally the
“Crown” ; it can own property, has a
seal, can sue, and may be sued. That is,
if anyone can find a joint in the statu-
tory armor (S. 35) which forbids the
citizenry to bring action against the board
for loss or damage—a legal corslet of
steel.
The board may do things innumerable.
It may fix the price of milk, maximums
and minimums, and conditions of supply
and collection. It may number “milk
stores” —the uncommon words used by
the Act for factories or shops—and carve
“districts” into “sub-districts,” as many
as it pleases. It may issue all kinds of
certificates, plain or colored. It may
inspect dairies, cows, scales, measures,
appliances, mugs, vehicles, utensils. It
may (and does) call for returns, as the
stars of heaven for multitude. It may
put milk under a ban. It may require
the merchants of milk to keep
records, registers and entries in red and
black. It may take samples or regulate
hours for doing anything whatever. It
has the high justice, the middle and the
low. By “Gazette” notice it may direct that
milk must not be distributed by retail
except between the' hours of 1.17 a.m.
and 2.34 a.m.
Once the Governor “proclaimed,” and
a miracle happened. All milk then be-
came the property of the board, free
from all mortgages, charges, liens and
pledges. The board may sell milk, buy
milk, and buy ice-cream. It may go
into research, physical, bacteriological
and economical; may establish grades
of milk ; may, in fact, do anything in,
about, relating or incidental to milk
which the imagination can conceive.
One who resists the board is liable to
a £2O fine. The board itself may be fined
if it borrows without the Governor’s
knowledge—fined £5OO and disquali-
fied. It is empowered to borrow
from the Government and to issue
debentures; should it default, it may
be the subject of a major operation
by the Treasurer. It may resume land,
acquire machinery, equipment, and any-
thing else it wants. It has 15 specified
subjects for making by-laws, commencing
at (a) and ending at (o). What it cannot
do to a herd or a dairyman is known
only to the Supreme Court.
The board and its 40 clerks are housed
within carved freestone walls, all ashine
with glass, cedar and blondes. The
staff-room (50ft. x 30ft.) is filled with
those aids to devotion the typewriter, the
calculating machine and the Book of
Prosecutions. There are clerks for forms
in all colors ; specialists in shop transfers,
registers, receipts and by-laws; oracles
who can tell of the perfect form
of infant-bottle and of the exact
number of fluid ounces in tin cans.
There is one clerk who can quote chapter
and verse for the statement that, in six
months, 4,300,000 gallons of milk were
consumed in the metropolitan police dis-
trict. Another can show by book and
candle the reason why Mrs. Pickwick was
inhibited from making up beverage milk
in Peterloo.
Everyone’s table is piled high with
files. Does Mr. Winkle want to sell
milk? Then let him write to the
board. The procession begins ; forms
accumulate ; Mr. Winkle has become a
file. He is bound up in cardboard, and
given a number. He gets a license, pros-
pers, is fined, sells out to Wardle, or does
any one of many things; but the file
grows.
A clerk enters with an immense ladder.
He climbs to a high shelf, deposits the
file of Winkle, and resumes the tale of
Wardle, till that also goes to its long
home. Or a neighbor reports that some-
one’s cow makes night hideous. An
official visits Strawberry, takes her tem-
perature, looks at her tongue, makes a
swab of her throat, sets her on a long
official journey. There are inspections,
reports, letters, isolations; Strawberry
herself becomes a file. Another clerk
knows all about by-laws, offences, fines,
prosecutions, summonses, remissions,
appeals, and other aspects of the com-
plicated Law of Milk. And there is
always at the counter a vendor or a
herdsman or a dairyman.
Everyone seems to be happy— except
the consumer. He pays sevenpence a
quart for country milk and eightpence
for milk from the suburbs.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Chapman Case.
The case of Dr. Chapman shows that
it is not only solicitor trustees whom the
public needs to be guarded against.
Dr. Chapman left the Professorship
of Physiology at Sydney University to
become Director of N.S.W. Cancer
Research at a salary of £2500 p.a., with
the right of private practice. His influ-
ence was felt in numerous spheres. His
work on miners’ phthisis and that on bak-
ing methods were equally well known, and
he dabbled, scientifically and otherwise,
in such widely divergent subjects as gold-
mining and the making of bricks, hair
dyes and beauty appliances. In univer-
sity and scientific circles he had a great
reputation for executive and financial
ability. He was regarded as a benefactor
by Science House and by the University
Club ; both institutions owe their present
ornate and comfortable quarters largely
to his efforts and interest.
Two months ago The Bulletin criti-
cised the administration of the Sydney
Cancer Research Fund. It did not allege
dishonesty; it suspected none; but it
attacked the directions in which funds
were applied, the lack of co-ordination
between the committee and the hospital
clinics and the secrecy in which opera-
tions were enveloped. In another article it
proposed that the financial side of cancer
research should be handed over to a
committee of businessmen.
A few days afterwards Dr. Chapman
died suddenly. A doctor refused a certi-
ficate, and an inquest is to be held.
Wholesale and systematic defalcations
are alleged, among them £22,000 from
the Australian National Research Coun-
cil and £BOOO from the Royal Society
of N.S.W. According to the Vice-Chan-
cellor, no Sydney University funds are
involved; this statement extends to
cancer research. Reputed a rich man
through his industrial investments, Dr.
Chapman, when he died, had only a few
pounds in the bank, though he left a
will disposing of £85,000 —“bluff,” the
solicitor for the Royal Society said.
The thing is deplorable, as much be-
cause of the damage which it will do to
worthy causes as because of the loss of
the money. Application of ordinary busi-
ness precautions, such as an effective
audit and finance-committee control,
would have made peculation impossible.
As it was, most of the bodies in which
Dr. Chapman was concerned seem to
have been one-man shows.

The Millennium for M.L.
Dr. Campbell Begg, head of the Maori-
land Legion, has evolved a plan to lift
his Dominion out of all its tribulations.
He proposes to bring a million immi-
grants from Britain in a period of 15
years and “put them on the land.” As a
quid pro quo Father Bull is to cancel,
first, the interest on the M.L. debt and
then the principal.
When the scheme is complete Maori-
land will have nearly twice its present
population and no external debt. The
taxation burden will be greatly lightened
and the railways will make profits. In short,
the millennium will arrive with a bang.
Nevertheless, the plan doesn’t seem to
be popular. Two objections to it are
that about a fifth of the present popula-
tion is dependent on unemployment-
relief, and that the area of land still avail-
able and suitable for settlement is small.
Possibly Father Bull would be willing to
waive £162,000,000 of capital debt, to-
gether with the interest, to establish a
million of his population overseas ; but
then again he mightn’t.

Commissioner and Enginemen.
From Arthur S. Drakeford, Federal
president of the Locomotive Enginemen :
Your brief reference to the alleged “regula-
tion strike” of loco, enginemen in South Aus-
tralia (B. 23/5/’34) is inaccurate and mislead-
ing ; hence this correction.
The loco, enginemen objected to the South
Australian Commissioner, while a supplicant
to the Federal Arbitration Court and awaiting
its award, drastically reducing the engine-time
preparation, stabling and relief allowances from
May 6. They asked him not to operate the
reductions, but he refused to do so; so, from
May 9, after giving notice, they took the
times previously in operation.
The Federal Court called a compulsory con-
ference. Result, nil. Following which, Chief
Judge Dethridge gave an interim award which
prevents the Commissioner making alterations
unless done as provided for in the 1933 award
for the Commonwealth railways. The com-
ments of the Judge on the arbitrary action of
the Commissioner, which led to the dispute,
were about as critical as the limits of legal
language would permit, and justified the action
of the loco, enginemen up to the hilt. There
was at no time any question between the
South Australian Commissioner and the union
as to a dispute existing. In fact, it has existed
since 1927 on the Commissioner’s own appli-
cation, and is awaiting the return of Judge
Drake-Brockman from the Northern Territory
to settle it.
The Loco. Union, with others, however, took
action to prevent the South Australian Com-
missioner, in order to accommodate the N.S.W.
railways,' imposing another dispute upon the
one not yet disposed of, and the evidence and
the decision of Mr. Justice Evatt showed be-
yond question that the new log was a hollow
sham which crumbled when hit with a judicial
axe, and that the alleged dispute was not
“dinkum.”
The recent flare-up in South Australia arose
from the impression of the Commissioner and
his advisers that they could have arbitration
and strike at the same time. The decision of
his Honor Dethridge, C.J., merely showed
them that this impression was as much a de-
lusion and a snare for employers as it has in
the past been for the workers.
For the year to June 30 the Commis-
sioner reported a loss of £688,000. After
reading Mr. Drakeford’s letter, and notic-
ing how the unhappy man has to reckon
with the unions in South Australia, and
Mr. Drakeford’s organisation in Mel-
bourne, and Judge Dethridge in the same
city, and Justice Evatt in Sydney, and
Judge Drake-Brockman in the Northern
Territory (and possibly a flock of other
legal gentlemen at the Equator and the
North Pole), The Bulletin doesn’t
wonder at it.

Let ’Em All Go!
Archdale Parkhill, who went abroad
to attend a Postal Congress at Cairo, has
returned by a very roundabout route.
After leaving Egypt he was heard of in
the lighter capitals of Europe ; then in
Britain ; then in North America, whither
his colleague Pearce made so costly a
pilgrimage in the days of gold.
There has been criticism of this pro-
longed journey, and Mr. Parkhill deemed
it necessary to answer it. To a U.A.P.
gathering he explained that persons who
think it wrong for a Minister in charge
of the biggest commercial department in
the Commonwealth to go off on a costly
tour for several months in hard times
take a “shortsighted and fatuous view.”
As a result of his investigations the
Commonwealth Government “is in a
stro.nger position to attack the problems
that require solution.”
How these politicians love themselves!
Australia is represented in London by a
High Commissioner and State Agents-
General. Butter, meat and dried-fruits
experts are all on the spot. An accountant
and a statistician have toured the U.S.A.
to report to Mr. Stevens and Mr. Lyons
on the Roosevelt Plan. One of the big-
gest financial houses in the world advises
the Commonwealth Treasurer, and he
has at his disposal all the information
gleaned by the Commonwealth Bank,
which is in touch with the Bank of Eng-
land. There are nevertheless gaps in the
Government’s knowledge concerning “the
problems that require solution,” so it
must send the P.M.G. off, with a retinue,
to fill them.
If what Mr. Parkhill says about the
educational value of such journeys is true
in his case, it must be true of all Minis-
ters who spend a year or two in the seven
Governments. But he will find it hard
to make the electors swallow the rubbish
he talks.

Synthetic Wool.
“El V.”: Since 1926 at least a dozen
laboratories in Europe have been work-
ing to produce synthetic wool. I im-
ported some of the earlier samples. They
had none of the characteristics of wool
except a superficial likeness to it.
The other day a traveller showed me
some specimens of later German pro-
ducts. I had to look at them twice to
say that they were not a strong 60’s
merino. They had crimp and the feel
of wool, and I was assured that they had
the capillary and insulating features of
wool, though those obviously were not
apparent.
Now, Frank Watson, an experienced
wool-buyer, says that artificial merino
samples which he saw in Germany
“paused him more alarm than the Paris
riots.” One might well ask whether the
development of these types of artificial
textile is not the basis of Hitler’s wool
embargoes.
At any rate, the thing is a warning.
Above the Law.
Despite frequent exposures of Golden
Jest methods and the expressed concern
of N.S.W. Premier Stevens and his
Ministers about the operations of charity
promoters, these people seem to be above
the law.
One Golden Jest with thousands of
pounds in prizes to cover the usual thou-
sands of pounds in expenses was drawn
last week in Sydney with the aid of Mr.
Whiddon, who is in the lottery-shares
business. This gentleman advertised as
follows the day before the drawing:
Mr. Whiddon urges ticket-holders to
return their butts and cash to-day without
fail, either by post or personally Any
received by noon to-morrow [/.<?., a couple
of hours before the drawing] will be in-
cluded in the drawing.
The hide of the advertiser is illustrated
by the fact that Mr. Whiddon actually
prints the following regulations under the
Lotteries and Art Unions Act on his
application forms:
12. The promoter and committee of any
art union, or any employee thereof, or any
agent or seller of tickets, shall not sell or
dispose of, or offer for sale or disposal,
any tickets in the art union during the
period of seven days immediately prior to the
time fixed for the drawing for the prizes.
13. Agents or persons who have agreed
to act as sellers of tickets in an art union
shall return to the promoter of an art union
all butts and drawing dockets of tickets
sold by them, the proceeds of such sale
and all other tickets issued to them but
unsold not later than five days prior to the
date fixed for the drawing for the prizes.
A penalty “not exceeding £2O” is pro-
vided for breaches of these regulations.
Yet here is a person openly advertising
that tickets may be returned at the
eleventh hour. And a member of The
Bulletin staff was offered a ticket in the
street 24 hours before the drawing.
There are six unsold Golden Jest tickets
in The Bulletin office. They were sent,
unsolicited, to a member of the staff, and
if the latter ranks as an agent he must
be guilty of an offence in not returning
them. If the Attorney-General will pro-
secute, the Court will hear some home
truths. But he is not likely to prosecute.
Neither are Mr. Whiddon and those for
whom he works. While the regulations
are flagrantly broken there is no check
on what happens to tickets sent to persons
who do not formally agree to act as
agents.

A Judge’s Responsibility.
After an “urgently-called meeting,” the
Association for the Protection of Native
Races sent a telegram to the Minister
for Home and Territories requesting him
to appoint another Judge to try native
cases in the N.T., because “Judge Wells
has shown, by sentences inflicted and by
many remarks in court, that he has not
the necessary experience of native affairs
or racial relationships in the N.T. to
allow of an unbiased judicature.”
No doubt Judge Wells himself would
be delighted if the Minister accepted the
advice of this body, on whose meddling
he made such drastic remarks during the
hearing of the Stott case. For months
on end he has been trying native murder
cases, and he has evidently come to the
conclusion that much of the disorder is
partly due to the bad habits of the weak
Government, which leans on the advice
of interfering missionaries and mushy
philanthropists rather than on that of
experienced officials and police.
Moreover, the Judge’s position has
been made impossible by new regula-
tions adopted as a result of this unknow-
ledgable meddling. Judges normally in
murder cases have no option as to
sentence. But the new law im-
poses on this lonely and hard-worked
Justice the task of assessing the penalty.
He has shouldered it in the latest case
of the kind, and made it clear that sen-
tence of death should be carried out.
It was a murder case, the victims being
white men prospecting on the Fitzmaurice
River. The ringleaders must have known
the penalty—they and their associates
hacked the bodies to pieces with axes and
knives, tied them into a canoe and sank
them in midstream in the broad river.
They were brought to book only by the
intelligence and intrepidity of Mounted-
constable Langdon, who was in risk of
his life for weeks during the investiga-
tion, and who eventually sheeted home
the crime through the piecing together of
clues found in blacks’ camps hundreds
of miles apart.
Most people baulk at the carrying out
of the death penalty; but the fact that
nearly 20 whites and Asiatics have been
murdered in the N.T. in the last couple
of years shows that the murderers them-
selves have no such qualms. The present
tender policy is an invitation to the myall
to slay.
A prison term is merely a holiday to
him, and a gaol usually proves a univer-
sity of crime in which he is egged on to
further ill-doing by the boasting of his
associates.

Long-distance Members.
A glance at the electoral map of Queens-
land shows how far from perfection is
the arithmetical system of representation
which prevails in the Commonwealth
Parliament, difficult as it is to suggest a
better one. One member “represents”
Kennedy. If he does it effectively he
should be referred to in the House as
“the Honorable the Miracle.” North to
south it covers 15 degrees of latitude, and
is thus wider than Europe, and nearly
twice as deep as N. S. Wales, which
returns nearly 30 members. East to west
at its widest part, it spans nearly 11
degrees of longitude. If Victoria and
Tasmania got bushed in it blacktrackers
would be needed to find them.
In the red sandhill country of the south-
west, out from the Hamilton, they have
had a drought which has just broken
after several years. And on the edge of
the Papuan coast at Saibai, on the
northernmost boundary, it hasn’t stopped
raining since the Ark floated.
The first electioneering speech of the
present member for Kennedy, Mr.
Riordan, is a Queensland classic. He
said, without trimmings: “Boys, I don’t
know anything about politics ; but if you
vote for ‘Darby’ you’ll be home on the
pig’s back.” Mr. Riordan must know
more about politics now. He is sup-
posed to represent at one and the same
time the dry western cattle country and
the lignum, the Gulf of Carpentaria, the
al most-empty Cape York Peninsula, the
rich Central Queensland sheep district,
the mining areas from Charters Towers
and Mt. Isa to Horn Island inclusive, the
dairying country of the Atherton Table-
land and the railway vote of the Q.N.R.
Now, if the new redistribution plan is
accepted, he will acquire sugar and city
interests around Cairns and a quota of
Italians. He also represents Thursday
Island and Torres islands peopled by
races enough to fill Babel.
Some of his constituents Mr. Riordan
never sees. He is built on generous lines
and has done well on the Parliamentary
ration ; so a visit from him to the wild
part of the Archer district of Cape
York might be appreciated. His wel-
come would ( possibly be warm, and
accompanied by a feast in which he might
participate, though he would not partake
of it.
To get from the remotest sou’-west
corner of Kennedy to the remotest
north of it, Mr. Riordan has to travel
three thousand miles by the shortest regu-
lar route. In that he is worse off than
his neighbor, J. A. Hunter. Mr. Hunter
is never a thousand miles from anywhere
in his own kingdom, and he has no
problems worth speaking about other
than reconciling the interests of the outer
Darling Downs with those of Moora-
berrie and the Mulligan River, and those
of the fruitmen of Stanthorpe with the
needs of the pastoralists around Blackall.

A Greek’s Best Friend Is the
Beershop.
“Cosmos” : Monro, M.L.A., tells us that
the publican expects 40 p.c. profit on his
liquor sales (B. 30/ 5/ ’34). If he were
only satisfied with so little! At a pub
which supplies “businessmen’s lunches”
at 2s. each I have to pay 9d. for a glass
of lager—and I only eat at the place,
when I do, because I am used to having
a drink with my lunch. A bottle of this
same lager costs Is. 3d. retail, and con-
tains over three glasses. Since the intrin-
sic value of the contents is about |d.,
the brewer is presumably able to let the
pub-keeper have it at a reasonable price
wholesale. As nearly as I can work it
out, the publican’s profit on my nine-
penny glass of lager is 1500 p.c.
I had a “businessman’s lunch” the other
day, selecting the starred items on the
menu. At the end of the feast, which
consisted of a threepenny plate of soup
(value, say, id.) and two slices of mutton
with vegetables and roll and butter (value,
say, 6d.), the waitress slapped down a bill
for 2s. 9d. When I protested, she said
I hadn’t specified that I wanted the
b.m.’s lunch, I pointed out that I had,
as might be deduced from the fact that
I had eaten it. We adjourned to the
pay-desk to argue it out, but the lady in
charge there ruled against me, so I paid.
There is obviously a considerable profit
on the b.m.’s lunch at 2s. Imagine
the profit on the same lunch at 2s. 9d.!
More especially as a precisely similar
lunch can be got at an adjacent Greek
establishment for Is. 3d.
When my finances allow I feed at such
hotels as the Australia and don't be-
grudge a penny of the money. The cook-
ing makes it worth while. But the cook-
ing in cheaper hotels runs from
mediocre to awful; their only attrac-
tion is their cheapness —plus the all-
important one that they are allowed to
sell alcohol with meals. As a result of
their profiteering methods, some people
of my acquaintance take or send liquor
to unlicensed restaurants, which is a
nuisance, while others drink tea or water
with their meals. It isn’t the way to help
what should eventually be great indus-
tries here—l refer not only to the wine
industry, which must become as im-
portant to Australia within a few genera-
tions as it now is to France, but also to
the brewing industry, which also has a
tremendous future.
I would like to see every decent restau-
rant and teashop given a license to sell
Australian wines and beers with meals
on the most favorable terms possible.
France, where you can get a bottle of
sound wine for six francs or a carafe
of beer for three francs (with the franc
standing at 2d.) in tens of thousands of
reputable restaurants, derives much of
its revenue from alcohol; and it is one
of the soberest countries in the world.

“AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS”
“Exon”: The fact that the Thames
takes on another name in Oxfordshire
evidently confuses some travellers. From
“I think you'll like this one, sir. Quite modern, very intimate, and, if I may
say so, sir, decidedly fruity.”
a lady’s article on “Eight Weeks at
Oxford in the S. M. Herald”:
And there is the Cherwell, upon whose
waters the bumping races are held year
after year, one side lined with the barges
of the colleges.
Was there nobody to whisper to the
most English of Australian newspapers
that the Cherwell (locally, Char) is a
“punts and picnics” brook that never
bore a racing eight on its sluggish bosom,
and couldn’t accommodate a single col-
lege barge?
* * * *
“Pentecost”: All this talk about learn-
ing languages (B. 30/5/’34) makes me
tired. My experience, a fairly varied
one, is that if one lives for a few weeks
among a people speaking a foreign lan-
guage, familiarity with the colloquial ver-
nacular comes automatically. Six months
after leaving that particular country and
going to another I have found that the
once-familiar tongue has been forgotten,
though there may be a tendency to slip
a word or a phrase from the old lingo
into the new one. At one time or an-
other I learned to speak the Taal, Sesutu
and Zulu, Hindustani, French, Arabic
and two or three Papuan tongues well
enough to get along. To-day, except for
a little French, which I revived during a
stay in Egypt, I have forgotten the lot,
though I can remember individual words.
* * * *
“Morobe”: The verb “to finalise” (B.
23 / 5/’34) can hardly be described as an
Australian coinage ; it is an Americanism
imported by King O’Malley. I can dis-
tinctly recall a leading article in the Mel-
bourne “Argus,” when O’Malley was
Minister for Home Affairs, deploring
some of his phraseology and taking par-
ticular exception to “finalise.” If the
writer of that leading article is still alive
and reads “S.T.S.’s” opinion that “it
looks as if we had really done the Eng-
lish language a service,” it is possible he
may have an opinion to offer.

“S.T.S.”: The gagged-and-bound bank-
clerk idea has moved up. At a S. Aus.
country town it was the branch manager
who was found thus, and who, after a
little cross-examination by the police,
admitted that he had fixed himself up to
attract the attention of head office.

“Oxmead”: Touching the customers
of the N.S.W. Parliamentary bar con-
tumeliously referred to as “four-finger
artists” (B. 30/5/’34), I think that Marion
Crawford, an almost forgotten Ameri-
can novelist, was the first to explain the
inner meaning of the “pilot’s two fin-
gers.” The U.S. pilot, traditionally, at
all events, measured his nip with four
digits on the side of the glass, but com-
promised with his conscience or in-
dulged his sense of humor by “furling”
the inner two, without altering the posi-
tion of the others, before the grog was
poured. Incidentally, I suspect that Aus-
tralia contracted the “help yourself” habit
long before Britain did. America pio-
neered the practice, of course, but in the
eighties of last century it was still con-
fined to the American bars in London
hotels and music-halls. I doubt if it ever
appealed to the average English Bung,
even when whisky was three shillings a
bottle.
“Double Disc”: I can guarantee the
strength of the war-time tetanus serum
(fi. 30/5/’34). After having collected
le utj u- l t
most of an H.E. whizz-bang I was
removed to the advanced dressing-
station, where the M.O. did the
necessary with an injection. I reached
the casualty clearing station hardly
conscious. A sister had a look at
me, a nd, despite my feeble protests,
pumped another dose of serum into my
well-perforated hide. Forty-eight hours
later lumps as big as cricket balls ap-
peared all over me, causing agonising
pain. A doctor in No. 3 London General
expressed his concern when I told him
that I had had two injections of serum.
I got over the wounds; but the extra
dose of dope nearly finished me. The
first M.O. had forgotten to enter his
issue on my ticket.

“Figurehead”: Some trouble was occa-
sioned at Darling Harbor, Sydney, when
a shipment of chilled meat was to be

ties that the wharfies should wear
newly sterilised gloves and white smocks
Have you any visible means of support ?”
“Well, not VISIBLE, your Honor.”
over their everyday clobber, as “germs
had got into some previous shipments
from this port.” The innovation was not
unnaturally objected to by the wharf-
laborers, but, after they had at last con-
sented to sweat in thick gloves and wool-
len clothes specially designed for freezer
work, a controversy arose between the
owner of the meat, the shipping com-
pany and the stevedore as to which was
expected to foot the bill. None of the
parties being disposed to shell out, the
Maloja engineers were approached for
spare overalls. They advertised their
neutrality by reminding the inquirers
that they only had new suitings on hand,
which would be dutiable as imported
clothing if landed. The P. and O. stopped
further argument by paying the bill itself
—the hire of eight woollen suits and
gloves at 3s. 9d. each.

“Lord Luvus”: Ryrie-street, Geelong,
is claimed to be the only street in the
world where a citizen waiting for tram
or ’bus can put a penny in a slot and
tune in to music, song,
sport or market reports.
The first penny-in-the-
slot radio is the inven-
tion of E. L. Barnes,
who lives in Ryrie-street.
On its first night of com-
mercial activity the de-
vice netted two shillings.
If the inventor could
arrange for his cus-
tomers to hook on to
“Bull” Ryrie telling uncensored yarns of
the campaign against Jacko, he could
easily get two shillings a time.

“Chevroford”: Some tourist attrac-
tions don’t require advertising. Two or
three weeks ago the charred body of a
man was found planted in a culvert on
the lonely Bullen-road, out beyond Kew
(Vic.). The police report is that he was
an Italian who was strangled in the city
and conveyed to his resting-place by
motor-cycle ; whether this will be estab-
lished or not, since the crime has
become a major mystery thousands
have visited the spot. An active trade
in pieces of charred wood, alleged to
have been used to burn the body, has
sprung up, and a ’bus proprietor has
established a regular run. A couple of
hundred yards further along the road is
another shrine which once enjoyed an
even greater fame as the spot where a
taxi-driver was once done to death.
Although it happened 10 years ago, l
often observe cars stopping there (I live
near by) and a group of persons gazing
pensively at the scene of the tragedy.

“Mako”: One country that will never
be perturbed by the introduction of the
uniform-shirt is Maoriland, for shirt and
serge shorts have been the regulation garb
of her schoolboys for quarter of a cen-
tury. It is considered “sissy” to wear
the shirt closed or the sleeves other than
rolled up above the v elbows, and many a
newcomer to the Dominion votes the
outfit too skimpy for winter wear. And
once when two M.L. youngsters in
the uniform of King’s College, Auckland,
bobbed up at a Sydney rink in the
middle of January, a horrified door-
keeper requested them to “go home and
put some clothes on.”

“C.Q.”: There is a reversal of proce-
dure in the method whereby Mrs. Arthur
Connell, of Winnstey-place, Armadale
(Vie.), came by a £50,000 legacy. The
rule in these matters is for a horde of
people all of the same name to form a
committee, collect funds and send a
delegate to England to contest their
alleged claim to Chancery millions left
by some putative and defunct relative
who died a century ago. Mrs. Connell’s
£50,000 was bequeathed to her by a
stonemason uncle, a childless widower,
who died in N. York last year. He
wrote to his solicitor stating that he
could only remember his niece as a
golden-haired child of six in Aberdeen.
The attorney traced her from there to
Armadale.

“Okey”: Pushes and gents, whose in-
dustry calls for the heaving of half a
brick must now be careful, otherwise the
person or persons struck are likely to
be able to sue for breach of warranty
through not receiving a standard article.
The Standards Association has fixed the
specification. A dinkum Australian brick
henceforward must be from 8 15-16th
inches to 9 1-16th inches long, from
4 5-16th to 4 7-16th inches wide and
from 2 15-16th to 3 l-16th inches deep.
Bricks must be free from large cracks,
warpage, stones, pebbles or particles of
lime, and when struck together they
should give a ringing sound. They must
further be square with sharp edges in
view of the kind of head which flourishes
in some suburbs. But every person buy-
ing bricks may choose the kind of sur-
face he needs, and specify strength and
physical requirements. For politicians
one made of granite sand with a bit of
lead in the middle is recommended
(though not by the S.A.), but those who
require them for gentler uses, such as
subduing the wife, will probably find
Canberra clay a constituent which will
save them money and give them a greater
range of action with a lower trajectory.
JUNE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now the mellow autumn’s going; chilly winds
will soon be blowing
From the ranges where it’s snowing and the
bleak expanse of plains;
Now the beer is quite sufficing sans the cus-
tomary icing
It requires to be enticing when the drouthy
summer reigns;
Now the canny draper brackets pullovers and
lumber-jackets
’Mong the most alluring packets wherewithal
his shelves are strewn,
And the furrier devises ladies’ coats in various
guises
(Mostly rabbit, one surmises) ’gainst the
wintry nip of June.
Now the hoarse, tumultuous cheering tells of
footballers careering
Down the field and deftly steering through
the ruck the sphere that’s goaled;
Now the hot-pie trade grows brisker, and the
hairiest canine frisker
Finds himself, for all his whisker, like that
owl of Keats —a-cold.
Now the maid in alcove cover snuggles closer
to her lover,
And the space-effacing chauffeur reckons
wraps and gloves a boon.
Peppery curry by the plateful comes as any-
thing but hateful,
Aye, and Irish stew is grateful, in the biting
month of June.
Now the big logs blazing brightly form a com-
forting and sightly
And inspiring feature nightly in the spacious
country inns;
Footling things like radiators seem uncommon
small pertaters,
And a bishop drapes his gaiters thankfully
around his shins.
Skies may be a trifle duller, but there’s com-
pensating color
In the cheeks of Maudie Muller and of
Barbara Bethune
(Names I need for rhyme and metre); and I’ll
say it makes them sweeter
And artistic’ly completer in the bracing days
of June.
Other bards, you may remember, find a far
more glowing ember
For their fanning in September and the
magic touch of spring;
In their lyric lines they list her as the English
April’s sister,
When the buds begin to glister and the
mating birds to sing.
But, for me, I find the torrid weather singularly
horrid,
And the dog days seam my forehead —and
they ever come too soon.
So, beside the cheerful ingle, lo! I dedicate
a single
Solitary scrap of jingle to the good old
month of June.

T. THE R.


“Idle Imp”: Is there anything Austra-
lians won’t bet on? A Brisbane radio
station’s Friday-night review of the fol-
lowing day’s races takes the form of an
imaginary description of each race from
barrier to box, the horses placed by the
announcer being his tips for the next
day’s events. Every Friday night there’s
a crowd on our street corner wagering
on the imaginary races with a tobacco-
nist-bookmaker.
* * * *
“Adelaide”: Tidiness can be carried
too far. One of the S.A. betting-shops had
complaints from authority about the litter
of losing tickets thrown on the footpath
outside. To encourage punters to keep
them, the proprietor offered to pay ss. for
a number picked at random at the end
of the day—and was charged with “hav-
ing unlawfully conducted a lottery.”
Trifling charge, said the P.M.; “but pay
£1 costs.”
“S ai 1 o r”: We
hear a lot about
ships departing
with fo’c’sles full of
masters and mates,
and of stokehold
gangs made up of
men with chiefs’
certificates ; but I
had an eye-opener
the other day of
how the depression
has hit the mercan-
tile marine. Pos-
sessing two sex-
tants, both first-
class instruments, I
decided to dispose
of one of them,
and dropping in at
Uncle’s I asked
what he thought
would be a fair
price for a sextant
that had enough
extras on it to en-
able a blind man
without arms to
take an altitude.
The clerk grinned,
and asked me to
step into the de-
pository. On a
three-decker bank
of shelves were
more sextants than
I imagined there
were men to use
them. They ranged
from apprentices’
long-barrels to the
finest and most up-
to-date night oc-
tan t s. Then he
showed me bin-
oculars and chro-
nometers by the
score, while in the
slop were enough
brass - bound uni-
forms to fit out the
navy of a South
American republic.
When I reached the
fresh air, free from
the depressing odor
of naphthalene, I
offered up a silent
prayer for my fellow-sailormen.
* * * *
“Hunter-Tucker”: There shouldn’t be
much difficulty in determining what John
Batman looked like (B. 9/ 5/ ’34). His
features are displayed in several books
taken from a drawing by Nuttall, who
sketched it from the painting “The
Settlers’ First Meeting with Buckley.”
This painting was done by Frederick
Woodhouse, who won a Victorian Gov-
ernment prize with it about 50 years ago.
Batman, of course, was not at the original
meeting with Buckley, but the figure was
painted from a drawing supplied by Wil-
liam Weire, Batman’s son-in-law, and was
certified by Batman’s daughter as a very
good likeness of her father. It shows
Batman (head and shoulders) in a sort
of sailor rig, with a fringe of under-
whiskers adorning a very clear-cut face.

“Old Q.”: Talking of erudite Judges
(B. 23/5/’34), Judge Brennan, of Queens-
land, laid himself open to correction
when laying down the law on billiards
and other matters at a reception
to Walter Lindrum. In his pre-
judicial days Mr. Brennan had the
reputation of being a sportsman,
but the rarefied atmosphere of the
Bench has probably dulled his
memory. Anyway, after referring
to “Mark Twain’s” definition of
proficiency at billiards as evidence
of a misspent life, ’Sonah deplored
the alleged fact that Australians
did not support their own geniuses,
and instanced Les Darcy, who “had
to fight out of Australia to prove
his laurels in the art of fisticuffs.” It
was Herbert Spencer who made that un-
kind remark about billiards ability. And
Les Darcy never fought outside Australia.
* * * *
“D.E.”: A Hobart policewoman has
been the means of extracting interesting
information about the faith-healing
methods of Veni Cooper Mathieson,
whose commanding presence and com-
pelling eye are known in most of the
Australian cities. Soliciting treatment
for an imaginary ailment, the Johanna
Hop was told she was “a very sick girl”
—had a “growth,” which was “angry.”
Thereupon
T was taken into what accused called
her “healing-room” and told to undress.
Accused put red flannel across my abdomen
and called on the Lord to effect a healing.
“Sister” amplified this statement by ex-
plaining that her way of destroying
parasitic growths was to place her hand
on the patient’s solar plexus and breathe
on her body ; she claimed to have healed
“Take my advice, Maudie—make ’em jealous.”
“many lawyers and legislators.” Fined
two pounds and costs, she said she
couldn’t pay and would go to gaol. I
remember the lady when she had a
copying-office in Hannan-street, Kalgoor-
lie, and contributed to a Sunday news-
paper. She is no mean platform speaker,
and has written books.
* * * *
“X.S.”: Melbourne shelters about the
most incurious person on record. He
discovered a loaded revolver on the
grass in Queen Victoria Gardens,
with one chamber freshly discharged.
Near it he observed a man on a
seat, spoke to him, and, getting no
"My husband is frightfully run down”
"Business worries, perhaps ?”
"Oh, it can’t be THAT! His business has just been wound up.”
reply, presumed the other was asleep.
Putting the weapon in his pocket, the
casual citizen went home, and it was not
till he read later in the papers that the
man on the seat was found with a bullet-
hole in his temple that he associated
the gun with the “sleeper.” Until he
explained things, the police had the
knotty problem to solve of how the de-
ceased, who had apparently suicided, had
disposed of his weapon.
* * * *
“C.L.”: Went to a ball at Tweed
Heads (N.S.W.), centre of an important
banana-growing district, and was sur-
prised to note many of the youths wear-
ing white gloves. I thought at first they
must have come into fashion again, but
a local chemist put me wise: “Those
young fellows work on banana-planta-
tions, and the sap of the banana blackens
their hands with a stain which is almost
immovable. There’s a good thing in it
for someone who can invent a soap to
wash it off.”
# * * *
“The Dip”: I described the Mona Lisa
(B. 23/5/’34) as a canvas on the
authority of the Louvre people. In an
official statement contradicting a report
that the masterpiece was being sent
to England for special treatment and
renovation—it is disintegrating in flakes,
and the only chance of saving it
seems to be by immersion in special
oils—it is described simply as a canvas.
In any case, the evidence at Perugia’s
trial definitely set forth that it was rolled
up and removed from the building under
the Italian’s blouse.
* * * *
“Uramao”: Two youths in Scotchby-
terian Dunedin displayed something of
the Rob Roy spirit when they chose
to break into the house of the
Supreme Court Judge resident in that
city. At the trial one admitted that he
had gone there three times —“the quarters
are comfortable, and the whisky is out
on its own.” A brother-Judge at Christ-
church, before whom the young men
were brought, displayed no vindictive-
ness at the desecration of his colleague’s
sideboard when he admitted the culprits
to probation for two years.
* * * *
“Pawang”: An extraordinary murder
has been diverting public attention from
the cares of the Spanish State. Donna
Aurora Rodriguez shot her daughter
Hildegart because she had fallen in
love with an Englishman and threat-
ened to abandon Socialism. Hilde-
gart was one of the most remark-
able infant prodigies in history. She
is famous for her writings on sex, and
commenced her career of Andalusian
Marie Stopes at the age of ten. Her
writings were far from being porno-
graphic nonsense ; a book which she pub-
lished at the age of 12 was reviewed by
Havelock Ellis. There may therefore be
some basis for her mother’s claim that
Hildegart was the Trilby to her Svengali,
for Donna Aurora is a hardened old
radical, and includes in her beliefs
anarchism, free love, atheism and
the right to kill offspring in accordance
with eugenist principles. The story
should make a theme for an opera that
will make “Carmen” seem tame.
* * *
“Kahminyah”: “Cleeve” (B. 16/5/’34)
is certainly right in saying that a blunder
was made when it was stated that A. L.
Gordon’s old sweetheart was still alive
in England, but it wasn’t Sladen’s mis-
take. I have read the manuscript of the
book ; no mention is made anywhere of
the age of Jane Bridges, and all through
she is referred to in the past tense, so I
presume she is no more.
* * * *
“Lancewood”: “Black Elliott” (B.
23/5/’34) is correct to the extent that
“The Flowers of the Forest” is the lament
of Lowland Scotland for those who
fell at Flodden, but the authorship is
generally assigned—by Quiller Couch,
among others —to Jane Elliott (1727-
1805). Probably the fragments of an old
song were used for a foundation. Tradi-
tion has it that the verses were the out-
come of a bet between Sir Gilbert Elliott
of Minto, Lord Justice Clerk of Scot-
land, and his daughter, who was chal-
lenged by her father to write a ballad on
Flodden. It is such a masterpiece of
tenderness and beauty that it is hard to
believe that it was written at least two
and a half centuries after the battle.
* * He
“Verri”: What an indelible impression
a single moment of horror will burn
into the brain! A Maoriland engine-
driver, now retired, was on a goods
train travelling in the Waikato. While
crossing an unprotected railway bridge
he glanced down and saw, just below the
wheels of his engine, the upturned face
of a child framed in a pink sunbonnet.
The station was quite close, and he de-
scended, sick with shock, to report and
join a search party that scanned the creek
below. There was no sign of the child,
but before long she was found. She was
the daughter of the local schoolmaster,
and, intent on taking a short cut, had
disobeyed orders and crossed the bridge.
When half-way she heard the train ap-
proaching, and had sufficient presence of
mind to lower herself on to one of the
supports and cling to the edge of the
bridge, her face appearing through the
opening between the sleepers. She was
little the worse for the experience, but
the driver declares that for years he never
closed his eyes at night without seeing
for a second a child’s face upturned in
a pink sunbonnet.

Who’ll fool you into hopes of easy spoil;
Beware the glib, persuasive double-dealer
In bogus propositions, gold or oil;

Fight shy of urgers and of Lascar seamen
In smuggled silks who offer bargains rare,
And watch out for the unofficial demon
Who’s paid to dog your footsteps anywhere.
Keep skinned your eyes for reckless motor-

Tearing the busy thoroughfares around,
For pirates who may bite your lug for fivers
Or smaller fry who’ll touch you for a pound;
And don’t neglect to look for coves who loiter
A chain or two behind, when forth you fare
On biz or pleasure. For there’s none adroiter
Than private ’tecs who’ll tag you anywhere.

And so exceeding circumspect your tread
That nobody, you think, can hold a pistol
For conjugal transgressions at your head,
It’s best, my worthy friend, to take no chances.

POLITICAL POINTS
Subject to the consent of C.P. branches,
Earle Page is willing to let U.A.P.
members have immunity from opposition
in N. S. Wales, without seeking it for
his own men, and to run joint Senate
teams in other States. Considering the
constitution of his party, he could
scarcely go farther; anyway, his offer
is a fair basis for negotiation. But a
conference in Melbourne attended by
Lyons, Stevens and Menzies and sundry
secretaries has issued a demand for “a
complete union of the two parties and
organisations.” If this is the U.A.P.’s
last word there will be no agreement.
The C.P. was born in Westralia in
1913, when Lyons was an earnest young
Labor politician of four years’ standing.
By the end of 1914 it had members in
both local Houses, and five years later
Federal Representatives arrived from
several States. In effect, the Cockies arc
older than the Nats, as well as the
U.A.P., so the proposal that they should
allow themselves to be swallowed by the
latter concern strikes them as the limit
in cool cheek.
Tasmanians are listening with their cus-
tomary phlegm to the arguments for and
against the sole remaining pre-depression
Government. Judgment will be delivered
on Saturday. It is expected to favor Lee,
though not by the two-to-one majority
that McPhee got three years ago. The
natural desire for a change, especially on
the part of the unemployed, will tell
against the Nats.; moreover, sectional
(North v. South) and anti-Federal feeling
may cost them seats. On the other hand,
Ogilvie, leader of the larger Labor mob,
has given the people too much cause to
regard him as an imitation Lang.
Tas. Labor, according to its leader,
demands
Justice for Tasmania. If not, then Seces-
sion. At the rate the deficit is accumulating
Tasmania will soon go broke, like New-
foundland.
It was as a Dominion that Newfoundland
went broke, but Mr. Ogilvie aspires to be
Prime Minister of a Dominion “like New-
foundland.”
A crazy plan for electrifying the rail-
way from Sydney to Newcastle, at a cost
of a million and a quarter to a million
and a half, has been rejected. It was
reported months ago that Hartigan, the
Railways Commissioner, had recom-
mended it to the Government. If so, he
must have changed his mind. Second
thoughts are best.
Friends of Premier Stevens, still look-
ing for a soft snap for him, had the gall
to suggest that Hughes should give up
his soft snap in North Sydney and stand
for the Senate. Billy’s reply nearly blis-
tered the atmosphere. If Stevens feels
that he must enter Commonwealth poli-
tics, though the call for him is not
deafening, why doesn’t he take his chance
in a doubtful electorate, as abler men
have done, and men not particularly able?
T. J. Ley resigned from the N.S.W.
Bavinshaw Ministry and unseated a
Laborite in Barton.
The Law Lords of the Privy Council
were rather impatient with A. B. Pid-
dington when that worthy started out to
persuade them that the elected Legislative
Council was unconstitootional. “I have
listened to you for five minutes,” one old
gentleman testily interposed, “and I have
not followed anything you said.” Five
minutes! N. S. Wales has been listening
to him for five and forty years.
“Really, Mr. Piddington,” complained
Lord Russell of Killowen on the second
day of “Piddo’s” marathon speech to the
Privy Council, “you speak a language I
do not understand.” His Ludship must
think it is the Australian language. Actu-
ally, “Piddo” speaks Johnsonian English,
though he is even more addicted than
Samuel was to making sardines talk like
whales.
How undying is the bitterness of these
Labor wrangles! Though poor little Cole-
man was for nine years Federal member
for the district which sends Lang to the
State Parliament, Concannon, M.L.C.,
was the only Langster who went to his
funeral. And Concannon is out of favor.
The Argentinos knew what they were
about when the refused to reduce their
wheat exports. During the week Russia
bought Argentine, Canadian and Aus-
tralian wheat for Vladivostok ; and, with
drought continuing in the U.S.A., New
York offered 112| cents a bushel, cash,
for No. 2 hard winter wheat. The New
Dealers have gone in for crop restriction
“Russia contemplates abandoning her aloof attitude and joining civilised society in the
League of Nations.”
“Shave, please !”
at a great rate —have even paid farmers
to become destroyers. Crimes against
nature are avenged.
Forgan Smith, visiting Elliot, the
British Minister of Agriculture, in Lon-
don, found him oddly tractable on the
subject of import quotas; in fact, he
gathered from what the Major said that
quotas are to be dropped. Prompted by
Percy Pease, his deputy, he asked the
Minister a question, and dashed off to
the cable office with the reply: ■—
Elliot emphatically denies that Bruce
had any authority to put forward any
quota suggestions or similar matters of
policy on _ behalf of or at the suggestion
of the British Government.
Percy had accused Bruce of asserting
that he spoke with such authority.
Except for one Queensland Treasury
official, Percy’s account has not been
corroborated.
Though Bruce is not the presumptuous
ass Percy Pease evidently takes him for,
he has no great range of words, and his
choice of what he uses is sometimes un-
happy. Thus he is reported to have said
at Ottawa that “Britain’s unemployment
problem will remain unsolved until the
flow of surplus population to the
Dominions is resumed.” “Surplus popu-
lation” is a most unfortunate expression.
Dickens puts it in the mouth of Scrooge.
Westralians pride themselves on having
an advanced criminal code, but on one
point it urgently needs amendment —or
the jury system does. At Fremantle a
bright little lad was found dead with a
knife sticking in his heart. He was the
son of a ship’s cook, a widower, who had
fought in the ring, and perhaps taken
too many thumps on the head; and the
father was charged with murder. The
defence was that he had committed the
crime in a maniacal frenzy after having
been rejected by a public-house lady with
whom he was infatuated —a theory sup-
ported by a lady doctor and a hospital
superintendent. Verdict, not guilty, on
the ground of insanity, followed by the
announcement that the momentary
maniac is now sane and may be released
any day.
The Westralian secession petition is
being embalmed in a roll of parchment,
and will journey to oblivion in London
in a casket of jarrah. Most undertakers
prefer cedar for long-distance work.
The latest to be pushed through the
window by Brisbane’s Labor aldermen is
Dr. Hamlyn Harris, the entomologist, who
has had charge of a mosquito-extirpation
branch, with a squad of six men. Six
more go on the pay-roll in his place. The
Labor theory is that no one wants to
know whether a mosquito is Stegomyia
fasciata, Culex anopheles or any of the
other breeds. The main thing is to swat
them all, and toilers who vote the ticket
can do that without being ordered about
by a borjoice with a microscope.
S.A. is the latest State to start raising
its own loans again. Butler is getting
£500,000 from his Savings Bank. He
says the operation will save £ll,OOO in
underwriting charges which would have
had to be paid had S.A. participated in
the £12,000,000 Commonwealth loan.
Tasmania has an unusual politician in
Chief Secretary James. When plain
member for Bass, he opposed Parliamen-
tary pay-increases brought in by Labor
and returned £lBO to the Treasury. As one
of McPhee’s Cabineteers he helped to
vote 25 p.c. off the salaries of Ministers
and members, and he is pledged to sup-
port a further cut of 10 p.c. A Laun-
cestonian, and director of a wholesale
business there, he is, as he says, “oppos-
ing the wishes of my constituents” for
road connection with Queenstown, say-
ing that the Missing Link, as it is called,
would cost too much, and that if Mt.
Lyell closed down Queenstown would
become a dead town. He seems in danger
of losing his seat, it will be no credit to
Launceston if he does.
The Commonwealth Government ought
to be capable of answering the Westralian
case for secession, but, true to its
fashion of shirking duties which demand
thought, it has shoved the job on a
committee, which will doubtless be paid.
The committee is to consist of represen-
tatives of the three Westralian parties,
with Robert Garran and ex-Senator Keat-
ing to help. The C.P. man is Senator
Carroll (the other C.P. Senator, Johnston,
is a secessionist); the Laborite is W.A.
Somerville, who has represented the
unions on the State Arbitration Bench
for many years.
Stevens was asked the other day by
Budd, the Byron man, how much longer
his Government is going to tax income
from other States which has been taxed
three or four times before it reaches the
recipient. He replied:
The question is one for reciprocal
arrangement between the States; but it has
not been possible to arrive at any.
Spooner, speaking on October 4, said:
The Government proposes to legislate
on this matter and to invite co-operation
from the other States.
Except as a means of getting even with
the Sydney Government, no other State
taxes income from N. S. Wales. When
an Administration goes in for legalised
robbery and cannot help referring to it,
it should at least pitch the same tale.
Spooner’s bill amending the Sydney
Corporation Act aims at preventing the
Council from raising the wind in the
reckless fashion of the past, as well as
doing away with the dosshouse vote. It
has led to angry debates at the Town
Hall and plain and fancy invective in
Macquarie-street; and a few Yaps are
expected to side with the Langsters. Not
because they really believe in a fran-
chise which gives one vote to Anthony
Horderns’ and hundreds to lodgers oppo-
site, but because the thought of being
heckled in their electorates makes them
shiver.
The M.L. Government is extending the
life of the present Parliament for a year.
There has been a flurry of criticism, and
Priminister Forbes, who is also (though
not a lawyer) Attorney-General, has
quoted Blackstone, who said that a Parlia-
ment has “absolute despotic power,” and
Dicey:
In a legal point of view Parliament is
neither the agent of the electors nor in any
sense a trustee for its constituents. It is
legally the sovereign legislative power.
These observations apply more appositely
to the Mother of Parliaments than to
her offshoots—Newfoundland’s case is
in point. Even so, they afford a very
good reason why constituencies should be
careful whom they elect.

Harold Gengoult Smith, a Victorian
K. 8., is one of. life’s predestined suc-
cesses. As Melbourne’s L.M., he will
receive the Duke, and almost certainly
get another order to increase the radi-
ance of an already scintillating chest. He
first served in the war as a doctor (he
has an Edinburgh degree), but soon left
his base job for the firing-line. Nor-
man Brookes is his father-in-law, and
he is only 43.
Dr. W. Arundel Orchard conducted the
Sydney Conservatorium orchestra for the
last time last week, and retired from his
job as director. He was associated with
the Con. for 20 years, and director for
more than half that time. An amiable,
frail-looking little man, he was neverthe-
less an iron disciplinarian. He had a
passion for chamber music, and his Trio
in D Minor was performed at the Con-
servatorium last month. He became a
D.Mus. of Durham (where he had gradu-
ated as B.Mus. in his youth) six years
ago.
The Duke saw some stout old Orange-
men, no doubt, during his recent visit to
Ulster ; but Sydney owns the equal of
any of them. Here he is—the Rev. John
Waddell, who became eligible for the
Nonagenarians’ Club last month. This
representative of one of the most
exclusive bodies in the world is a
kind of hereditary Orangeman. An
ancestor fought at the siege of ’Derry.
He arrived from the north of Ireland at
the age of ten, and went with his parents
to a farm near Goulburn. There were
few excitements for backblockers in those
days, but he enjoyed one that would send
many a modern picture fan green with
envy ; he had the contemporary equiva-
lent of a front seat in the mezzanine
lounge when Ben Hall was shot down
by the police. He joined the Methodist

Kidd missed the V.C., but was made
much of by Queen Victoria, who visited
him in hospital, and gave him a set of
bagpipes.
Con Drew, shown here by Finey, has
been play-writing, novel-writing and
journalising in Sydney for quarter of
a century. His
father was W. L.
G. Drew, C.M.G.,
an old-time Q.
Auditor - General;
and an uncle, Sir
Edward Strickland
—a bearded Cri-
me a n general—
was one of the
celebrities of
Manly when W. B.
Dailey lived there.
Con went to sea
as a youngster, but
got home in time
to enlist for the
S’African War. He
served for two
years with the Q.
Mounted Infantry,
and was at the
relief of Kimber-
ley. He is the first
Australian who has
had a play pro-
duced in a major
Sydney theatre :
his “linker” ran
for six weeks at
the Royal. His
novels, which are
of a sporting character, include “Rogues
and Ruses” and “The Doings of Dave.”
The Bookstall Co. is publishing “A Syd-
ney Harbor Beachcomber” next month.
Justice Ferguson (“Fergie” to the N.
S. Wales Bar) had been a hot local
favorite for the K.B. Stakes for some
years. He began as a journalist, was a
Hansard reporter while studying for the
Bar and wasn’t called till 1890, when he
was 30 years of age. He specialised in
common law, was raised to the Bench in
1911, and proved a great and human
Judge. Sydney University, where he
graduated, is one of his loves ; he was
vice-chancellor in 1919. One son was
killed and the other wounded with the
A.T.F.
“D.”: Lord Russell of Killowen, one
of the Lords of Appeal who are listening
to the oratory of A. B. Piddington, K.C.,
on the N. S. Wales Upper House matter,
is only a life peer, like his father the
L.C.J. His father couldn’t afford a heredi-
tary peerage, and neither can he. The son
lacks the magnificent appearance, voice
and manner of the greatest Irishman who
has sat on the English Bench. He is a
stocky, drab-looking little man ; but he
has a brilliant mind. A younger brother,
Bertrand, who entered the British Army
in the ’nineties, and got a D.S.O. and
several wound stripes in the last war, saw
a good deal of the Australian soldiers in
S. Africa and France.
From a member of the Inner Temple:
A. B. Piddingto.n’s burst of totally irrelevant
stump-oratory before the Privy Council last
week (“a time of breaking nations, when
representative government throughout Europe is
being replaced by brute domination, obtained
and maintained by force”) will give members
of the London Bar something new to be funny
about anyhow. For over 20 years the his-
trions of the various Inns have been giving
imitations of a Canadian counsel who once
tried to spellbind the members of this icily
aloof jurisdiction on similar lines. Poor old
“Piddo” couldn’t have turned his impassioned
gaze on a less promising subject than the Law
Lord who snubbed him. Tomlin of Ash is a
dour Middle Temple Equity man who is an
authority on partnerships, and who was almost
exclusively employed while at the Bar as coun-
sel to the Inland Revenue and Charity Commis-
sioners and to learned bodies like the Univer-
sity of London and the Royal College of
Physicians.
Sir Hugo Hirst, one of the new barons,
visited Australia with “the Big Four.”
His interests in this part of the world are
attended to by Edward Hirst, a near rela-
tive. Though he personally controls the
huge General Electric and acts as an
adviser to the Government on many sub-
jects, he is one of the most accessible
men in London. He is a connoisseur of
Havana cigars and Jersey cattle and
owns some good horses.
Ivor MacGillivray has just had a 94th
birthday in Port Adelaide. He was one
of S.A.’s earliest Labor members, with
CON DREW, playwright, novelist and
sportsman.
a safe seat in the
Assembly from
1893 till 1916,
when he went out
on the Conscrip-
tion issue. He was
born at Lossie-
mouth —the place
the Ramsay Macs
come from.
P. G. Taylor, of
Sydney, Kingsford
Smith’s second
pilot and naviga-
tor in the centen-
ary air race, pos-
sesses a record of
his own. He is the
only flier of world
fame that the
Union Club has so
far produced. He
has flown from
Australia to Eng-
land and from
Australia to M.L. ;
also he owned a
seaplane with
which he made
many pleasure
trips from Broken
Bay, where he housed it, and he has been
a pilot on the Sydney-Brisbane route.
One way and another he has nearly 3000
flying hours to his credit. He got an
M.C. in the R.A.F.
P. H. Goldfinch, of the C.S.R., is one
of the new birthday knights. A leanish
person of modest height and demeanor,
he is one of the last you would pick out
of a crowd as head of a great concern,
but those who have seen him in action in
times of crisis know there are two Gold-
finches. The other has a jaw which sticks
out like Wilson’s Promontory and the
diction of a slow-action machine-gun.
His father was an officer in the R.N. ' He
was born at Gosport and educated at
Sydney Grammar. It took him just 30
years to step from the most junior clerk-
ship in the big sugar co.’s service into
E. R. Knox’s shoes.
From Harold Mercer:
The Bulletin obit, of P. E. Coleman (like
all the others) was wrong in one respect. He
did npt organise the Clerks’ Union. Arthur
Jones (now with the Taxation Department)
was the man. Scandalised at being commanded
to work back for the third night in a Week
without any payment but tea-money, Jones
published an advertisement calling a meeting,
at which the union was formed in 1908. He
was its secretary (unpaid) for ten months. I took
charge then. Coleman, who was only 17 at
the time, was expelled for writing to the “S. M.
Herald” protesting against the action of a
clique which had forced me to resign the sec-
retaryship. The expulsion motion was
expunged from the books later, and Coleman
(then assistant-secretary of the Seamen’s Union)
became secretary. He was responsible for the
complete consolidation of the union.
Harold Cohen, who was issued with a
C.B.E. on the King’s birthday, already
has a C.M.G. and D.S.O. He is one of
the Jews who did brilliantly in the
A.I.F. A keen militiaman, he left for
Egypt in charge of a Second Divvy artil-
lery brigade shortly before the evacua-
tion. He commanded the 7th (Mobile)
Brigade in France. His democratic ways
and sense of humor made him popular
with the other ranks, and he knew his
job. He has acquired his latest decora-
tion as Honorary Minister in the Vic.
Government. This smiling, unspectacular
little Hebrew has one of the best busi-
ness brains in Australia, and is among
Victoria’s half a dozen richest men.
“Kure”: In Admiral of the Fleet Mar-
quis Togo the world has lost' a pheno-
menon that can never recur. He was its
last link between the Middle Ages and
to-day. When his powerful clan sent
him to the R.N. College, Greenwich, 55
years ago, Japan stood socially, culturally
and otherwise in the sixteenth century.
He himself —one of the greatest men the
Empire has produced—remained a
mediaevalist in many respects to the end.
From the time he began his career as a
cadet in the Satsuma Navy in 1863. he
fought in every major Japanese engage-
ment at sea until his annihilation of
Rozhdesvensky’s fleet in 1905. Then he
retired, and stayed in retirement for the
rest of his life. His utter self-effacement
and his worship of his Emperor belong
to a nobler if less knowing age than ours.
Cancer of the throat killed him at 86.
Lord Wakefield, whose King’s Birth-
day present was a step in the peerage,
has many associations with Australia.
He has helped England-Australia fliers,
financially or otherwise, from Alan Cob-
ham to Jean Batten, and he is an
honorary member of the Australian
Pioneers’ Club and of various flying
clubs. The list of his benefactions to
the British nation covers nearly a column
of “Who’s Who.” Most of his money
comes from Wakefield and Co., oil
manufacturers.
This is Hector Bolitho —one who has
gone a long way further than most men
of 36. Born in Auckland (M.L.), he
joined the staff of Sydney “Evening
News,” as literary editor, when he was
in his early twenties. Then he left for
England and became a professional bio-
graphist. He specialises in royalties, but
is ready to consider less important beings
provided their characters are beyond re-
proach. A matter, partly, of environ-
ment. He lives at The Deanery, Windsor
Castle, and is now collaborating with the
Dean in a life of the eighth Earl of Elgin
HECTOR BOLITHO, a Maoriland jour-
nalist who has become famous in
England as a biographer.
—son of the ambassador who collected
the “Elgin marbles” while in Turkey and
brought them to the British Museum.
Bolitho passed through Sydney last week
on his way to London after a visit to
relations in M.L. He is unmarried, and
the only man who has worked on an
Australian newspaper to be elected to
the Athenaeum.

So far as the eye can see, this 14-year-
old vendor of credit on the pay-as-you-
earn principle has had a relatively mild
experience so far as bad debts (shown as
written off in the table) are concerned.
This, together with the co.’s past per-
formances and the recent recovery in
earnings, suggests that it has very select
connections, or that the management has
uncommon ability in estimating the
credit capacity of its clients.
The co. began about 14 years ago,
when Buckinghams, the drapers in
Oxford-street, handed over their cash-
order business to some of their em-
ployees. What a money-spinner it has
been is plain from the fact that £133,609
of the £206,905 of paid capital is bonus
scrip, the last £93,367 of which was
handed out in 1927, goodwill being
written up by that amount for the pur-
pose, thus raising the intangible to
£112,087, which is not treated as an asset
herein. The div. thereupon dropped to
15 p.c..? which called for only £4389 less
than 35 p.c. did in the previous term.
With the arrival of hard times came
keener competition for a smaller volume
of business at reduced rates, and gross
earnings, which were £85,570 in 1929,
fell to £52,754 in 1932, when the amount
was £lBO in excess of net earnings.
Then the tide turned, the volume of
business improved, net earnings nearly
doubled, the debts question became a
little less troublesome and shareholders
got 7! p.c. for the 1933 term.
For the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts, gross earnings (£65,240)
sprang £3279; administrative charges,
etc. (£33,638), were £4530 heavier. After
striking off £7795 (about half the pre-
vious year’s figure) for bad debts, etc.,
and including £5OOO dropped from some-
where into reserves, there was enough
to show 13.9 p.c. on capital as against
8.4, a loss, 8.4, 16.7 and 16.7 p.c. back
to 1929. So 1! points were added to the
div., raising it to 9 p.c., the final being
at the rate of 10 p.c. p.a., which is easily
within the co.’s reach while conditions
remain as they are.
The management has steered clear of
the danger of leaning too heavily upon
outsiders: %

Last year the co.’s furniture showrooms
in Pitt-street were extended, and £5059
was added to the book value of free-
holds. To do this, and carry an extra
£13,182 of book debts, the board went
outside for an extra £7094 and drew
upon cash for £2185. The improvement
in the more or less liquid surplus
(£129,987, including stocks) was £4897.
Only the B shares are listed—there
are 167,068 of them fully paid to £1
each, with priority as to capital. At 30s.
the return is 6 p.c. on a 9 p.c. div. basis ;
the cover is 19s. lid. in net tangibles. All
scrip ranks equally for divs.

Owing to the rise in the price of the
staple and the satisfactory outlook for
fine wools, the market is now paying
more attention to the scrip of wool-and-
produce and pastoral-finance concerns.
Though this one put 1320 fewer bales
(94,647) and 2174 fewer cattle (11,289)
under the hammer last year, it sold
18,015 more sheep (415,109), and its
gross earnings (£107,342) were £26,331
better. Exes. (£86,603) made off with
£17,447 of the increase. After refund-
ing 20 p.c. of the wool-selling commis-
sion and sending £637 to the staff provi-
dent fund, enough remained to show 6.6
p.c. on capital as against 3.9, 3.9, 4.4, 2.3
and 9.4 p.c. back to 1929. The div. was
lifted a couple of points, making 5 p.c. for
the year, leaving £3856 to be ploughed in.
Over the last two years the market
has advanced its bid for the pound
shares, which are covered by 265. Bd. in
net tangibles, from 9s. to 225. 3d., the
return at the higher figure being 4\ p.c.
on a 5 p.c. div. basis. For the 16 years
to the close of accounts in 1921 divs.
averaged 7.2 p.c. During the next eight
years the business expanded rapidly,
prices were high, a steady 8 p.c. was
paid, and clients, who are mostly share-
holders, got £64,566 in rebates. Then
there was a dry patch, followed by 3 p.c.
p.a. for the three years to the end of
March, 1933. Much will depend upon
the course of seasons and prices, and upon
how the Melbourne branch turns out.
Balance-sheet movements reflect the
extension of the business to Vic., where
the co. bought the goodwill (price not
stated) of Grant, Fledge and Co., stock
and station agents, Melbourne, as from
Nov. 1. It also bought 2\ acres at North
Melbourne, and is putting up a fine new
wool store thereon:

plus (£52,800) was only £20,188.

The cotton bounty, payment of which
was discontinued half-way through ’32,
provided the profit claimed in ’3O and ’3l,
and more besides, and greatly reduced
the loss in ’32. The principal section
of the business, hosiery and knitted
goods, has gone on making larger losses.
The board complains of unequal com-
petition from other States and a falling
market during the last term, when the
loss was £176,830, or £105,546 greater
than the previous year’s. That was after
transferring the balance of the stock
adjustment reserve (£31,018) to the p.
and 1. account; £57,000 was transferred
from the same source in ’32. Exes.
(£139,390) were got back £27,529. To
offset the p. and 1. debit of £145,716
there is a capital reserve of £166,067 ;
but that is mainly a book entry in respect
of the freehold. A revaluation of stocks,
down £134,752, accounted for a con-
siderable portion of the year’s loss. After
allowing for this portion, the trading loss
for the second half of the term was
relatively small, the chairman says.
So far as balance-sheet figures show
it, the position is as follows:

To chip £3473 off the mortgage, £7482
off the overdraft and £32,264 off
the amount coming to sundry creditors,
debtors’ balances were reduced by
£36,903, and the book value of plant by
£12,734. Nothing is said concerning the
efficiency of the plant, upon which much
depends. When the books closed, out-
side liabilities exceeded more or less
liquids by £426,882, an increase of
£133,044 over the twelvemonth.
Formed in 1929 by a group of credi-
tors, the co. took over the G. A. Bond
hosiery business and that of its cotton-
spinning associate. Most of the old trade
debts were funded by the issue of
£544,033 of debentures, redeemable in
five years. They carry a nominal 7 p.c.,
reduced to £5 Bs. 6d. by the statutory cut.
Doubtful whether the co. will be able
to keep up regular payments, the market
prices these £lOO debentures at £4l or
thereabouts. Excluding the capital
reserve and allowing for the mortgage
and overdraft, the cover is £94 13s. 4d.
in net tangibles. The shares are not
listed.

During the year the supply of electrical
power was changed from direct to alter-
nating current. This involved the co.
in a loss of over £8000; the loss on
trading lifted the figure to £11,720. Aus-
tralia has not been in the market for
much heavy machinery lately, and the
co.’s plant for the manufacture of electri-
cal transformers and switch-gear has been
practically idle. The overcrowded state
of the poultry-farming industry has light-
ened the demand for incubators, and
competition in the lift business is so keen
that it is doubtful whether prices now
cover manufacturing costs, says chair-
man J. B. Nicholson. To overcome the
difficulties the management is concen-
trating upon improvements in design and
efficiency, as well as making an assault
upon costs. Meanwhile, enough general
business is being secured to keep a
skeleton staff together.
The financial position slipped, of

The year’s reduction of £9295 in the
book value of stocks was largely on
account of the change in the nature of
the power supply already referred to.
To clip £11,584 off the amount coming
to sundry creditors and carry an extra
£3308 of book debts, investments were
reduced by £16,628. The contraction in
the more or less liquid surplus (£32,409,
including investments and stocks) was
£10,719. The store at Waterloo is still
vacant, and will be sold at the first oppor-
tunity. It is claimed to be worth more
than its book value.
The market, doubtful of an early re-
covery in the eo.’s earning capacity, prices
the fully-paid 13s. 4d. shares at 4s. 6d.
It thus values the undertaking at £41,605,
or £87,303 less than its net tangible book
value at the end of March.

The spring in earnings reflects the re-
markable recovery in the motor trade.
The £10,357 netted was £20,186 better
than the previous year’s result, and re-
duced the p. and 1. debit to £6967, which
has been wiped out by profits earned
since the close of accounts. The way is
thus clear for the co. to start payments
to the prefs., whose arrears of divs.
amounted to £45,766, equal to approxi-
mately 9s. Id. per share, to Nov. 1 last.
Paid capital is £122,296 in 101,000 £1
prefs. and 106,480 ords. of 4s, each.
The prefs.’ rights to a cumulative 7| p.c.
(reduced from 10 p.c. by the statutory
cut) and to priority as to capital are,
therefore, largely nominal. To give the
ords. a chance to get into the picture
again—they have gone without for the
last seven years, and 16s. per share has
been lopped off their capital since
1921—the co. is to be reconstructed.
Capital is to remain intact, and
the pref. div. is to be lifted to its
original contract rate of 10 p.c. cumu-
lative again, thus sidestepping the pro-
visions of the N. S. Wales Interest Reduc-
tion Act. Any profits distributed after
that are to be divided equally amongst
the prefs. and the ords., until arrears of
pref. divs. have been wiped out. That
is to say, should £15,200 (= 12.4 p.c. on
total capital) be distributed, the prefs.
would get 12! p.c. and the ords. 12 p.c.
The co. and its two subsidiaries —Over-
land Sydney, Ltd., and Overland, Ltd.—

agency concerns, sums up the risks by
pricing the prefs. at 245. 4d. The return
at that figure is 8.2 p.c. on a 10 p.c.

No commercial aviation concern has
produced better results than this one.
Formed at the end of 1927 as an off-
shoot of Guinea Gold, its ’planes provide
quick transport from the coast to the
goldfields, some 3000 ft. up in the moun-
tains in New Guinea. In a little over five
years it has paid divs. aggregating 162|
p.c. ( = £78,875) and scattered £20,000 of
bonus scrip, making paid capital £75,000,
which had the support and protection of
£33,401 of genuine reserves at the end
of February.
Here is the co.’s progress looked at
from another angle:
Tonnage Average Passengers Gross

The growing activities of Bulolo Gold
Dredging (it has its own ’planes, which
are operated by Guinea Airways), of New
Guinea Goldfields and of others in the
Morobe district are responsible for the
spring in last year’s figures. Gross earn-
ings were £33,508 better, and the net
result benefited by £17,149 of the in-
crease, reaching 40.2 p.c. on capital as
against 17.4 p.c. for the previous term.
The div. was kept at 20 p.c., the inten-
tion being to build up reserves. A
heartening feature is the persistent drop
in freight-rates, which lessens the oppor-
tunity of successful competition, either
by road or air.
Indeed, owing to the difficulties of
road construction and maintenance, the
future of air transport in New Guinea
appears to be assured. Still, now that
the carriage of Bulolo’s fourth dredge
has been completed, the current year’s
earnings may be less corpulent than those
of the one on whose heels it treads,
though there is nothing to suggest that a
contraction of the 20 p.c. div. is likely.
Transport contracts covering the next
two or three years have been entered into
with Bulolo, New Guinea Goldfields and
Burns, Philp, and there is the possibility
that new demands may arise. At the
moment, the co.’s future is governed by
the life of the mines.
Finances are robust. The more or less
liquid surplus (£58,227) was £24,835
stronger than at the previous balance.
The co.’s interest in its Fiji subsidiary,
now in voluntary liquidation, has been
written down from £l2OO to £lO in the
books. Fixed assets figure at £50,174 ;
replacement value of the ’planes alone
is put at £150,000.
Over the twelvemonth the scrip has
advanced from 28s. 6d. to 455. 6d. in
the market. At the higher figure the
return is 8| p.c. on a 20 p.c. div. basis.
The cover is 28s. lOd. in net tangibles.
The New Loan
The Loan Council, the central borrow-
ing authority for the Australian Govern-
ments, is on the market with £12,000,000
of 3| p.c. paper, offered at a discount
of 30s. per cent., and maturing in 1948.
The yield to the investor is therefore at
the flat rate of approximately £3 6s. per
cent., or £3 7s. Bd. per cent, including re-
demption. This is in accord with current
market rates for this class of security,
holders of which continue to enjoy a dis-
criminative advantage, the interest being
free of all State income tax and of addi-
tional Commonwealth income tax imposed
since June 30, 1931. These exemptions
were originally a sweetener to the big
national conversion issue of 1931. The
Council should thus have no difficulty
in securing the £12,000,000, of which
about one-third is to be used for the
sound purpose of retiring Treasury bills,
and the other two-thirds for public works
on account of the States.
Leo. Gibbons, recently in charge of
Lake View and Star’s special develop-
ment programme, and before that
assistant mining engineer to Pahang Con-
solidated, an English concern working a
large lode-tin deposit in Malaya, has been
appointed general manager for Gold
Mines of Papua, of which E. H. Pratten
is chairman. The co. was formed in
December last to prospect two main
lines of lode, the Umuna, on Misima, and
the Kulumadau, on Woodlark Island,
south-eastern Papua. The cyaniding plant
to treat 130,000 tons of slimes and sands
from the old Kulumadau is being
assembled. A. J. Peterson valued the
slimes at from 3dwt. to 4dwt., and the
sands at ldwt. or better.
* * * *
“Old Warden”: Commonwealth Mines
Preliminary Syndicate, which was
granted a large concession in North
Queensland by the State Government in
1930, has just launched a £600,000 float
in London to prospect and develop the
areas —the Palmer, Etheridge, Gilberton,
Woolgar and one or two less important
additions. The Etheridge, of consider-
able extent, with Georgetown as its
centre, is served by rail from Cairns.
The Palmer, behind Cooktown, is served
by another derelict railway, which runs
as far as the Laura, some distance from
the old field. Gilberton and the Wool-
gar are inland from Townsville, and even
in their heyday were diggers’ fields for
the most part. The Palmer was one of
the world’s famous alluvial fields. The
Etheridge was a fairly large reefing pro-
ducer at its best. The gold had a heavy
silver content, which lowered its value,
and water, curse of all N.Q. fields, began
to make at comparatively shallow depths,
while the ores became heavily sulphided
as they went down. Like the Palmer, the
field suffered from inaccessibility; the
railway came too late. But in those days
fine gold brought only 84s. an ounce, and
modern pumping equipment recovery
methods were unavailable. With gold at
nearly £7 an ounce (sterling) there may
be another story to tell, especially on the
Etheridge.
* * * *
At the Mons Meg, Lolworth (N.Q.),
the big greisen lode in a 6ft. x Bft. shaft
is wholly within the auriferous shoot
to a depth of 30ft., and the entire output
has averaged 18dwt. The lode has been
proved in the next shaft, 150 ft. away,
but the pay dirt did not come in there
until a depth of 25ft. A further claim
has the lode, which looks like running
into 300 ft. or 400 ft. in length at least,
and in one section is 15ft. wide. The
gold is free, with values in individual
shoots and not throughout the entire
greisen body. Prospects and the un-
usual nature of the body have intrigued
southern capital, and representatives
have been on the spot. There is just
a chance that the lode may prove to be
the big, and not necessarily low-grade,
deposit that N.Q. has been hankering
for.
* * * *
N.Q. Gold Mining Development Co.
meant the Kidston (N.Q.) option to be
a business affair. Before Cliff Rutledge
left the field he had contracts with
claimholders to crosscut along the
bottom of the oxidised ore, through
Wise’s Hill and North Knob. A com-
pany official followed to do the sampling
of these and all surface workings. If
things look good enough, an assay
office and pilot plant will be installed.
* * * *
The Black Jack Co., which has been
prospecting the John Bull lode in maiden
country in the Towers district (N.Q.), has
located a mineralised formation 3ft. wide
carrying a reef up to 18in. thick, and
reported to be payable.
* * * *
During April Fred Cuthbert’s New
Misima, Papua, milled 1237 tons of ore
for 934 tons of sands and 303 tons of
slimes, together worth £l5OO with gold
at its statutory price. Also, a parcel of
slag, ashes and sweepings was sold in
Sydney for £282. The usual monthly div.
of Is. 6d. per share continues to be sent
out.

Western Deep Leads Gold Develop-
ment, the Sydney co. which is attacking
the problems of deep-lead mining at
Main Ridge, near Rockley (N.S.W.),
where an extensive system is known to
exist, is in 6ft. of wash on No. 3 loca-
tion. Dish prospects show the stuff to be
worth 60s. per fathom, with gold at £7
10s., Australian currency. This is the
most encouraging development to date.
Costs are estimated at about 355. per
fathom. The old river-bed and its gold-
bearing gravels are now several hundred
feet above the present drainage level of
the district, and are covered by basalt.
This basalt capping is several thousand
feet wide in places, and huge landslides
affecting apparent levels of protruding
river-bed have added to the uncertainties
of prospecting.
* * * *
It is doubtful whether Goldmines De-
velopment, which is opening up the
Yankee at Trentham (Vic.), can earn
enough to pay divs. High costs (60s. per
ton), inevitable in this class of formation,
are the trouble. The average grade of
ore treated to date is 6dwt. 17gr. Hopes
centre on developments at No. 4 level.
Even if 10,000 tons of Bdwt. stone is
opened up here, it will be necessary to
sink the shaft another 100 ft., says Her-
bert Gepp. He suggested that one call
of 3d. should be the limit of financial
support accorded the venture. The next
two months will decide the fate of the
show.
* * * *
Hercules, Bendigo (Vic.), which is
treating lldwt. stone on the 1785 ft. level,
has just paid another Is. per share, mak-
ing total distributions £123,000 ( = 41s.
per share) since the new reef was dis-
covered in July, 1932.
* * * $
McPherson’s Reward Syndicate (Tas.)
has put out another thousand £lO shares.
The money is wanted to test a show at
Granya (Vic.), the Just-in-Time, Laver-
ton (W.A.), and 1750 acres of alluvial at
Pitfield (Vic.).
* * * *
Granites Development, which is hunt-
ing for a continuation of the Wiluna
lode in its North Wiluna leases, has met
with disappointment in the first shear
zone, and the shares, after touching 11s.
2d., dropped to 2s. 9d., and then recov-
ered to 4s. or thereabouts in the market.
From 375 ft. to 451 ft. the lode material in
the bore core shows no signs of gold.
Incidentally, the hole is going down at
an angle of 45 degrees. It is expected to
meet two other lodes further down, the
last one at about 900 ft.
Westralian Minister for Mines Munsie’s
prospecting scheme for absorbing unem-
ployed is doing well. Over 1200 sus-
tenance men are searching for gold, and
300-odd are working payable shows. So
far the total value of gold produced by
assisted prospectors is £27,000. Total
cost of the scheme to date is £37,000, of
which £3OOO has been repaid to the Gov-
ernment.
* * * *
Scott and party at Jonesville, about
70 miles from Wiluna, towards Sand-
stone (W.A.), cleaned up 136 tons for
2740 z. over the plates, and 200 tons of
sands for 1660 z. The Swan Bitter syn-
dicate has taken a six months’ option
over the show, and will probably
diamond- or calyx-drill for 1000 ft.
* * * *
The success of Paringa’s boring has
put North Kalgurli United in good heart.
The latter is going for the lodes both
ways—boring and mine development—
and the makes are in the same ore
channel that embraces the lodes of North
Kalgurli.

At Sons of Gwalia No. 27 level con-
tinues to improve as it extends south. The
management is not afraid of depth;

SHADOW SHOWS
“The Private Life of Henry VIII.”
The Bulletin remarked last year that
the great talkie, when it appears, will
inevitably be international. The much-
boomed film which has just arrived at
Sydney Embassy helps to confirm this
view. Financed by an Italian, directed
by a Hungarian, based on a story of
which one of the authors is Lajos Biro,
and made in England, “The Private Life
of Henry VIII.” has England’s foremost
actor in the name-part, distinguished
British actors and actresses as subsi-
diaries, three Australian girls in leading
female parts and an Australian as period-
expert. The rhythm, mentality and treat-
ment are American.
Sex and sensationalism are the chief
ingredients. Charles Laughton’s Henry
is neither formidable nor dignified.
Except that he speaks English, tears roast
fowls to pieces with his hands, and
doesn’t get drunk, he resembles one of
Guy Kibbee’s sugar-daddies. Watching
this lust-bedevilled old numbskull who
never opens a book or writes a line, and
whose only joke is a cheap Oscar Wilde
epigram, one forgets that Henry was the
greatest king England has had, and the
sponsor of the New Learning which gave
us freedom of speech and thought and
the Elizabethan poets and dramatists.
The truth about Henry’s private life
was not filmic ; his domestic technique
was as monotonous as that of a Holly-
wood star. In consequence, many liber-
ties have had to be taken with history.
Anne of Cleves, whose “coarse features
and unwieldy form” revolted London, is
depicted as a beautiful little creature who
tricked Henry into imagining she was
ugly because of her infatuation for an-
other man. Elsa Lanchester plays the
part. She is the only one of the younger
women who does her hair in period.
Culpeper is represented as Henry’s
favorite, and as having been in love with
Katherine before her marriage. They
were both at Court, but Henry didn’t
know of their attachment!
Laughton’s superb acting is the chief
feature. He makes Henry a foolish old
lecher, but very human and likeable. He
is any elderly man who is physically repul-
sive to the women who marry him for
his money, and who has to rely on well-
meaning friends for the news that he is
being betrayed. When he hears about
Katherine and Culpeper we are shown
emotional acting of extraordinary inten-
sity. From now on Henry ceases to be
a buffoon and becomes a figure of pathos
till the last sequence, in which he is a
dodderer being made miserable for his
own good by a masterful wife. All
wrong historically, no doubt, but a fas-
cinating character study.
Other features are the cutting, the
group-movements and the photography.
Particularly the photography. The writer
liked the open-air shots best, and the
hawking sequence best of all; but the
banqueting-hall, with the lights cast by
a brazier flickering on the walls, is pro-
bably as beautiful as any of them.
“Moulin Rouge”
At Melbourne Regent. It is a back-
stager —yet another variant on the one
about the young composer who produces
the song hit of a century and the world-
famous star who is billed to sing it in
the greatest revue that ever was, but fails
to turn up on the opening night, with the
result that the hidden genius of a Mis-
understood Female is revealed to a stupe-
fied nation.
The chief trouble with films of this
sort is that all the expectation and
emotion are built up on the appearance
of the Female. When she does appear
it is in a far from unusual vaudeville
turn, which she croons in a voice whose
merit is by no means extraordinary.
Constance Bennett doubles the part of
Raquel, the star from Paris, and Helen,
the Broadway damsel who replaces her ;
and Franchot Tone is the husband who
doesn’t appreciate her talent until she
comes forth disguised as her French com-
petitor. A lily-pond ballet establishes a
new standard for lily-pond ballets.
“The Lost Patrol”
This fine film at Sydney Capitol re-
counts the adventures of some cavalry-
men in Mesopotamia during the war. An
officer having been sniped, a sergeant
carries on. All the sergeant knows is
that if he keeps his men going north they
will get in touch with the brigade. Camp-
ing at night in the desert, they lose their
horses and are attacked by Arabs. Some
are shot; others knifed. When only six
are left out of the original dozen, two are
sent out to try to reach the brigade on
foot. The Arabs send them back tied to
horses, dead and mutilated. A British
aviator who descends in response to the
survivors’ signals is shot down as he
leaves the ’plane. At last the sergeant
alone remains, with ten graves.
Victor McLaglen couldn’t be bettered
as the sergeant; it is by far the best
thing he has done. Boris Karloff, as the
trooper whose religious leanings turn to
mania, and Wallace Ford, as the ser-
geant’s last mate, are also convincing.
The desert settings look authentic, and
the simplicity of the stoiy and its com-
plete freedom from sentimentalism give
it dramatic strength.
“Social Register”
Colleen Moore, with her hair swept up
and back from a high alabaster brow, is
Patsy, a chorine with a past, who hooks
a millionaire’s son. Invited to meet the
family in its Park Lane mansion, she finds
the party slow, wanders out to the bar
and gets drunk with the butler, after
which, according to the synopsis, “she
steals all the honors of the party with her
gaiety.” The family fail to appreciate
it, and this causes her to spend
the night with a saxophone player.
(In all innocence, be it understood: she
thought he was ill, and rushed to his
assistance.) The fiancd discovers her, so
she marries the saxophonist. The mis-
understanding is easily cleared up by the
fiance’s uncle, a debonair and immensely

The O’Reilly made a sour memo, to
the effect that this insight into American
home life was “not suitable for general

“Easy to Love”
Here we find Genevieve Tobin as a
wife who is trying to recover a philan-
dering husband (Adolphe Menjou). # Her
well-worn device is to fake an affair on
her own account. Mary Astor is the
who has cau . s ? d Ado }P h ®. to stray.

it’s doing Sydney suburbs as a “first
release.”
“Love, Life and Laughter”
It is billed as Sydney Lyceum’s major
attraction, but apart from Gracie Fields
there is little to recommend it. The
Lancashire lass is a London publican’s
daughter this time. For sweet charity s
sake she hits a visiting prince’s secretary
in the eye with an orange, whereupon
the prince (John Loder) becomes infatu-
ated with her. At his request she attends
a Court reception, but her hearty fun
doesn’t go down, so H.R.H. deserts his
class and takes a room at Gracie s
father’s pub. Then he becomes a film-
actor. But his father dies, and he has
to carry on. Gracie and her father pay
him a visit, but cause such consternation
that they return to England for the king-
dom’s good.
Miss Fields and her penetrating voice
and expansive grin have many admirers
in Sydney, and they all seemed to be there
on the first night.
“Autumn Crocus”
This film version of a play which has
been seen in Sydney has some beautiful
shots of the Tyrol. Several of the char-
acters —the sinful couple, the clergyman’s
sister and the two German tourists—are
given less prominence than they enjoyed
in the play. Ivor Novello, who isn’t so
young as he was, plays the flirtatious inn-
keeper on the lines of a matinee idol. Fay
Compton is admirable as the romantic
schoolmistress; so is Muriel Aked as the
disapproving sister of the English parson.
“The Life Story of John Lee”
This Australian film about a man
whom they tried and failed to hang in
England about the time Albert the Good
was in residence may be seen at Sydney
Civic.
It’s no use asking why the thing was
made. In extenuation, it gave work to
local mummers and near-mummers, for
it has a big cast to complicate the plot
and subsidiary stories. An effort, which
Hollywood might emulate, was made to
dress the performers according to some
indefinite pre-war period. Ronald
Roberts, a youth who in profile looks
rather like Queen Victoria with an Eton
crop, tried hard to make Lee human. It
says much for his art that few in the
audience were sorry he was not hanged.
Claire Barnes’s work was patchy as the
heroine who waited for him. It is a pity
suave Sam Stern’s moustache wasn’t
waxed and an inch longer each way. If
it had been he could have gnawed it at
the right moments, and been the com-
plete villain of melodrama as Jacques
Bertrand.
Sundry Shows
Sir Hamilton Harty concertina’d his
fourth collar at Melbourne Town Hall
on Wednesday before an enormous audi-
ence. Why the eminent conductor doesn’t
start off with a soft collar, since he
always finishes with a crushed one, is a
mystery. However, Sir Hamilton’s
starched neckwear was sacrificed in a
worthy cause. Never had a local orchestra
of casual acquaintance reached so
close to the standards aimed at by per-
manent organisations. There were some
rough edges—occasionally a part de-
manded to be regarded as the whole —
and especially amongst the brasses the
finer subtleties were sometimes sacrificed
for emphasis. But there was a general
advance in technical proficiency.
After the last ovation had died
down the orchestrions gazed on their
conductor with wet eyes and then loosed
their emotion in a hearty • cheer. Yet
nobody had ever made them put so
much hard work into three weeks in
their lives.
The question arises: What is to happen
next? If this orchestra of 75, having
demonstrated what can be done, is
allowed to disperse, most of the good
will be lost. The net result will be
that memory standards of comparison
will be brought to bear on local con-
ductors, who, give them their due, have
never been provided with the same oppor-
tunities of demonstrating their skill as
Sir Hamilton enjoyed. It would cost
more than £25,000 p.a. to make the
present body permanent, but that would
be a mere fleabite to the A.8.C., if it
had the will.
Wednesday’s programme included the
Harty transcription of Handel’s concerto
for orchestra with organ, which reached
great altitudes of majesty in the final
fugue ; “The Bartered Bride” overture of
Smetana, which gave the conductor an
opportunity for exercising his Irish pro-
pensity for cracking jokes, and the
Strauss tone poem “Don Juan,” whose
intricacies sound like chaos come again
at a first hearing. The Tschaikowsky
Symphony No. 6, with the unconven-
tional adagio finale, left an impression
of undiluted beauty on the ear. Laelia
Finneberg sang Weber’s “Softly Sighs”
and the “Ritorna Vincitor” from “Aida,”
and advertised herself again as one of
tire most intelligent vocalists Melbourne
has heard for a long time. The polka and
fugue from Weinberger’s “Schwanda,”
repeated by request, ended the proceed-
ings on a top note.

Susan Glaspell’s “Alison’s House,”
presented by the Experimental Theatre at
the Sydney Savoy, won the Pulitzer
Prize for Drama in the U.S.A. three years
ago, and, though weak in plot, it is strong
in atmosphere. It tells of the happenings
in an lowa home on the last day of the
nineteenth century. The house is occu-
pied by the relatives of a poetess,
deceased. Some revere her memory;
others are slightly jealous of her fame ;
others think that she has put the rest
of them in a bad light. Therese Des-
mond, as Elsa Stanhope, a sensitive,
wayward girl, was convincing and charm-
ing. Not nearly as good was the per-
formance of Francis Barclay in the role
of Aunt Agatha. Montgomery Stuart, who
forgot his lines now and then, as John
Stanhope, was lifelike enough in a stolid
fashion. Edward Howell was responsible
for settings, lighting and production.
Ethel Gabriel designed the costumes.

Current attraction at Bryant’s Play-
house, one of Sydney’s small but enter-
prising repertory theatres, is “A Bal-
cony,” by Naomi Royde-Smith. This
psychological drama portrays how a man
with brains stood up to the shock of
discovering that his wife was unfaithful
to him. It has conflict, a problem, well-
sustained suspense and a powerful
climax. Harry Harper, as the husband,
displays poise and confidence both in
carefree passages and scenes which call
for emotional outbursts. He is fairly well
partnered by Dorothy Shepherd as the
wife. Mary Harper is likeable as Gleddis,
and Frank Orr-Crago does some capable
character work. George and Beryl
Bryant are the producers.
At Sydney Royal “White Horse Inn,”
now in its tenth week, is still revolving
to good houses, with the end of the run
not even guessed at. At the Cri. “Ten
Minute Alibi” holds the fort and looks
good for another week or so. Musical
events in the offing are Hamilton Harty
and the A.B.C. orchestra at the Town
Hall on Saturday and a night of Russian
singing, dancing and orchestral composi-
tions at the same place on the 30th.

established itself firmly with the public

ABORIGINALITIES
“Mako”: Henare arrived from the
kainga bemoaning the loss of his pet
lamb, which had been killed by a stray
dog. He intimated that it would be im-
possible for him to cut any more wood
that week, as his grief was too profound
for manual labor. “Don’t be an idiot,
Henare,” the boss said. “Why, you’re
making more fuss than I did when my
grandfather died last year.” Henare re-
flected on this. “Werra,” he said at last,
“you no pring your gran’father up on

“L. 8.”: Re shark attacks in the Speck
(if any). About 55 years ago a man and
a boy were fishing off the jetty at Elwick.
The night being cold, the boy went under
the jetty to keep warm, and the man,
going to look for the lad, couldn’t find
him. Police and others next day re-
covered the body, greatly mutilated. Two
large sharks, swimming round the place,
were caught. I saw them on a dray being
taken away, presumably to Glenorchy.

“A.H.S.”: “John Dory” is right in his
summing up of the gastronomic abilities
of the platypus (B. 9/ 5 / ’34). A resident
of Badger Creek, near Healesville (Vic.),
has succeeded in rearing a platypus in
his back garden, but he advises anybody
wanting to follow suit to count the cost
first. Captured when about four months
old, the platypus was about 15 inches
long and weighed 48oz. At 16 months
he had grown four inches and tipped the
beam at 630 z. So far in his short career
he has tucked away more than 2501 b. of

“Wandana”: The frangipanni, now
very popular with southern brides —it is
rushed down from Queensland by ’plane
for wedding festivities grows very
readily in North Australia, a branch
stuck into the ground soon developing
into a flowering tree. At least three
varieties are grown in N.Q.; the ordinary
cream-tinted flower with golden centre, a
larger, pure-white bloom, and a rich pink
frangipanni—introduced to T.I. by the
late Bishop Gilbert White. Torres Strait
girls make bouquets by threading the deli-
cately tinted blooms on slender stems of
split palm or cane. The white, milky
fluid which exudes from a broken branch
stains the clothing ; so, if you’re helping
yourself to a pound’s worth of frangi-
panni flowers on your next northern
tour, handle the branches carefully.

“H.H.”: In the days before the
artesian bore the mickery man was an
institution on most stations in n.-w.
Queensland. A mickery was a timbered
well-shaft sunk into the sandy bed of a
creek; it was worked by means of a
pole placed across a forked stick, the
pole having a bucket attached to one end
and a weight to the other. Most mickery
men were old-timers. Two travellers
once rode up to a mickery on a Makin-
lay station. Their horses refused to
drink, and a large goanna was found in
the trough. Twice he was dislodged and
twice he climbed back ; then one of the
travellers settled him. Just then the
mickery man appeared on the scene.
“What’d yer kill me pet goanna for?”
he angrily demanded. The travellers ex-
plained. “Well, that was his business, ’
the old man roared. “He saved me a
lot o’ work by huntin’ off all the blasted
stray cattle that come here wantin’ a
drink out o’ me trough.” His mate at
the next mickery must have worked over-
time.

“A.C.G.”: There is a much more prac-
tical method of crow-catching than that
described by “Bogaduck” (B. 23/5/’34).
The idea originated among the sheep-
raisers of northern Vic. A piece of raw
meat is suspended in the centre of a
wire-netting cage about two yards square.
A round hole about 6in. in diameter is
left at the top. The birds fly in to get
at the meat, but, being unable to rise
vertically, and not having the sense to
climb out, remain inside. This trap needs
no rebaiting, and the more commotioh
Jack Crow makes inside the greater the
number of relatives that flock along to
be in the fun.

“Cockyson”: “King T.” says (B.
16/5/’34) that at Calliope (Q.) he was
introduced to a white cow which had
borne white, red and black calves, all
without a blemish in their coloring. Well,
I’ve been knocking about among cattle
nearly all my life, and I have still
to see a black calf. The calf whose
permanent color is to be black makes its
debut to the world in a dark-red or a
reddish-brown ensemble, the permanent
color not appearing until after the first
moult—when the calf is about three or
four months old. it is the same in the
case of a white or a grey horse. They
are of various shades of black when
foals, and are sometimes more than 12
months old before the permanent color
appears. With horses of mongrel breed
the permanent color remains an uncer-
tainty at times until the horse has passed
its third birthday. Meanwhile, it will
have changed its color—from bay to
roan, from roan to bay, etc. —many
times.

“No, mate — they’re not married yet.”
doorways by that same slender thread,
and constitute a graver danger than most
people realise. Measured by weight,
the poison of red-back spiders must be
one of the world’s deadliest. In the
summer months the mining shafts on
Lightning Ridge (N.S.W.) teem with
them, yet no one worries much about
them.
“J.R.K.”: In the Chillagoe (N.Q.) dis-
trict the red-backed spider is known as
“the jumping red-back.” I dislodged one
from an old bolt hole, and he jumped
nearly four feet at my face. This pecu-
liarity is not generally known, and un-
suspecting people have been bitten in
this way.

“J.R.D.”: Can’t personally swear to
having seen rabbits at Camooweal (B.
23/5/’34), but Blue Bob, our camp cook,
could —and frequently did—with pic-
turesque fluency. Bob’s rabbits, I must
admit, were invariably seen through a
glass darkly during one of his periods
of intensive lubrication in Camooweal,
and there was no limit to the colors,
though pink and purple predominated.
However, I can truthfully back “Prickly
Pear” up ; I saw rabbits myself in the
Territory over 20 years ago, about the
same time as “P.P.” —and I was several
months distant from the last pub. There
was at least one colony of bunnies on the
Big Hole of the Rankin (Barkly
Tableland). I came across them
purely by chance; even the
blacks had never seen them be-
fore, and the excitement among
the Wogya when they first saw
the possible new additions to
the menu was only equalled
by their reactions to the arrival
of the first motor-car about the same
period. Whether the rabbits have since
increased in the same ratio as cars I
cannot say. Anyhow, I expect the Ter-
ritory myalls are too busy nowadays
wangling jobs as checking officers in the
centenary air race to worry about such
mundane things as rabbits.
$
“Culpa”: The earwigs reported at
Bombala, N.S.W. (B. 30/5/’34), are Euro-
pean earwigs, which have only one pair of
nippers. The Aussie earwigs have nippers
at each end, and, apparently, as they
move with either end first, a combination
head and tail at each end also. I should
not like to see these remarkable creatures
driven out by alien invaders, but if that
happens I must admit that I am partly
responsible. When I came to Australia
from far across the sea some months
ago two earwigs stowed themselves away
in my luggage. Discovering them while
unpacking in Sydney I imprisoned them in
a match-box and wrote straightway to the
Immigration, Customs, Defence, Health
and Justice Departments asking what
next I should do. Before letters arrived
from the Immigration Department order-
ing deportation, from the Health Depart-
ment threatening to prosecute me for
introducing a source of foot-and-mouth
disease, and from the Customs Depart-
ment claiming ss. 74d. duty, the earwigs
had escaped, somebody having opened
their prison. I saw them flee through the
garden, pursued by bull-ants and trap-
door spiders, and gave them up for lost.
But evidently they were built of stern
stuff, for they shook off their pursuers
and kept going for 320 miles. When
the bull-ants get on their trail again those
earwigs will probably go either to Dar-
win or to Perth, which cities are warned.
I’ll probably go to gaol.

“Zebra”: The big magpie goose, a
party of which caused intense astonish-
ment by calling in at a lagoon near Bris-
bane (B. 30/5/’34), has not yet been
driven to the far north, for one hears of
the bird being shot in the season about
the swamps of the Burdekin delta and at
other places along the N.Q. coast. This
bird used to be commonly shot when
“flighting” at ‘night from one feeding-
ground to another. The last of the tribe
I saw was in s.-w. Queensland along
the Balonne River, where flood-filled
billabongs and briaries provided some
of the best duck-shooting I’ve ever seen.
That was 35 years ago, and since then,
I am told, most of the ducks have gone.
Another rare visitor to those parts was
the lovely black-and-white-striped pygmy
goose, in my opinion the fastest fowl that
flies and the hardest to stop.

“Mako”: Maoriland produces cockles
(B. 16/5/’34) in profusion, but wouldn’t
dream of mentioning them in the same
breath as the toheroa. Still, there is
another small shellfish, the pipi, with
long, white, semi-transparent shell and
delicious contents, that every Maori-
lander. brown or white, esteems mightily.
Also Maoriland waters yield a iarg-
deep-sea mussel which, parboiled and
then fried, is hard to beat.

“G.D.S.”: I found a silver-eye’s nest
and hung it outside my door. A few
days later I spied a thrush flying across
the garden with the nest in his beak.
Since then two light washing-up mops
with wire handles hung on the same nail
as the nest have also disappeared. Was
the bird simply saving labor, or has the
thrush the same instinct as the magpie?

A pup peeped out of his billycan;
A dozen fish-hooks adorned his hat;
His swag was a load a normal man
Would gaze in utter amazement at.
I bought him a pint and he yarned awhile,
Telling me something of years gone past;
Then he looked across with a thoughtful smile,
Remarking, “I’m just about the last.”
“The last!” I echoed. “The last of what?”
And the bar once more with my glass I beat.
His answer came with another pot:

Was all the graft we’d a fancy for;
And then we would roll our swags,” he said,
“And make for the river bends once more.

The tracks are not what they used to be;
No more I meet in some passer-by
A mate who has cruised the creeks with me.

“Bucko”: When the president of the
Moree (N.S.W.) show committee opened
the official dinner and proposed the toast
of “The King,” he asked the gathering

musical item should be the National
Anthem ; but the president was adamant.
“Nothing of the sort,” he replied ; “that’s
what we think about him, and we’ll sing
it.”

“E.S.”: A decided novelty even among
the many curious northern trees is the
two or three species of knotwood which
blossom along their trunks instead of
on the branches. These abnormal trees,
which reach a diameter of about 30in.,
grow on the Atherton Tableland and in
other N.Q. jungles. In the off season
they are remarkable only for the numer-
ous knots or lumps on the barrels, but
in spring pinkish buds appear on the
knots, and burst into a glory of white
flowers. The trees bear so profusely that
many of the boles are covered with blos-
soms, giving them a most striking appear-
ance. The flowers are followed by
clusters of fruit resembling apples, which
are edible, though rather insipid, and
vary in color from white to a delicate
pink. Wild turkeys are very fond of
these “apples.”
* * * *
“Pandanus”: The pumice-stone on
Australian beaches mentioned by “Lug-
ger’s Mate” (B. 23/5/’34) can be traced
further back than the Krakatoa eruption
in 1883. In 1799 Matthew Flinders, with
his brother Samuel and an abo. named
Bongaree, careened the sloop Norfolk
on Bribie Island, in Moreton Bay (Q.).
On account of the huge quantities of the
porous grey stone covering the surface
of the water, Flinders named one of the
passages in the bay Pumice-stone River.
Oxley, 24 years later, gave it its present
name of Pumice-stone Channel. The

stone once had a small commercial value
as a cleanser of cutlery and kitchen-
ware. I’ve noticed pieces of it on every
beach between Bondi and T.I.
* * * *
“Milne Bay”: I did not suggest that
British New Guinea coastal skippers of
the long ago (B. 30/5/’34) originated the
term “dogbarker’s ticket,” as applied to
the not very exigent master’s certificate
issued to them in those days, as “X.N.0.”
infers. Further, “dog-barking” was used,
not for “reef-dodging,” but for locating
a hospitable village for anchoring at night,
no one then attempting night navigation
on the n.-e. coast of B.N.G. Our method
of locating reefs was simple. We just
bumped them and pulled off again, the
local craft being specially timbered below
the water-line to stand trifles like that.
Also, we never used the bow-wows for
estimating our distance offshore. In
waters where one can sail from Cape
Nelson to the Trobriands and spit on a
fresh coral patch every minute of the
trip, “offshore” had no meaning for us.
* * * *
“Sailor”: There’s no doubt about the
N.T. termite as a quick worker. While
on a rail job between Mataranka and the
Katherine the ganger and I dropped a
shovel. We didn’t go down that way again
for ten days ; when we did the shovel
was still there. I picked it up ; the handle
collapsed like a piece of rotten white-
gum. The ants had been quick and
thorough.
* * * *
“Felis”: Once more the alleged “tiger-
cat” crops up in Australia. Melbourne
papers tell of the catching of a “female
tiger cat,” supposed to be the first of its
sex ever captured. What constitutes a
“tiger-cat”? None of the Felidae is indige-
nous to Australia—indeed, the genus does
not come south of “Wallace’s Line” be-
tween the Moluccas and New Guinea,
which arbitrarily divides the Asiatic fauna
from that of New Guinea and Australia.
If the creature were one of the indige-
nous “native cats,” so called, it would be
a dasyure, a genus peculiar to the Aus-
tralian mainland and Tasmania, and a
form of animal life which dates with
the echidna and the platypus back in
the world’s beginnings. The thing is, of
course, just a specimen of the domestic
cat gone wild and grown to exceptional
size after generations of good feeding.
These bush-dwelling cats are frequently
referred to as being discovered in various
parts of Australia and as something new
and strange to natural history, whereas
they are just perverted descendants of our
old fireside friends Tom and Tabby.
* * * *
“Kelly”: The other day 1 attended a
trial at the Supreme Court which was
not carried on appeal to the Privy Coun-
cil. We trapped a crow. To amuse our-
selves and to give the other Kellys some
fun, we ornamented him with a
bit of rag and let him go. Fie
hadn't gone a hundred yards before his
mates commenced to fall in behind him.
The numbers added, and our late captive
put up a lifelike imitation of a crow in
a hurry. They wheeled him and turned
him to perch in a tree. They surrounded
him. The Crown Prosecutor took up his
say. He affirmed that Kelly was a crow
of dissolute habits, given to bad com-
pany, without visible means of support,
and a lot more to the same effect. He'
called many witnesses. Mrs. Kelly
stepped up. She took one look at her
spouse and added to the list the sin of
philandering. Kelly tried to make a
speech in his own defence. He pointed
out that he had been a good husband
and a devoted father. The badge of
shame which he wore had been placed
there against his will. He appealed to
the jury to judge him on his past record
and to acquit him without a stain on his
character. The crows thought it over,
talking earnestly among themselves while
several kept guard over the prisoner. The
decision was unanimous: Kelly had
violated all the rules of crowdom by
adorning himself in a white man’s garb
—to wit, the rag which had once been
“Your ’usband seems to ’ave a wannerful opinion of the new barman, Mrs.
Maggs.”
“Yes, Mrs. Daggs —swallows everythink ’e puis over.”
white. Amid a flurry of whirling feathers
a bit of rag came twirling to the ground,
followed, when the others had done with
him, by all that was left of the crow
who had been decked against his will.

“Te Bab.”: Cocos Island (B.
2/5/’34) isn’t the only place unfavor-
able to rabbit propagation. On coral
atolls in the mid-Pacific the herbage is
coarse. Pet rabbits have often been
tried ; they stray, and are usually found
dead. The juicy appearance of young
pandanus leaves within reach of the
ground entices them. But the tough fibre
is more effective than poison bait.
Rolled into wood-hard balls, fibre and
thorns are found in the bellies of the dead
rabbits. Goats succumb even more
quickly.
* * * *
“Cooie-bird”: When timber-getting on
the Bananaland coast I came across
abundance of flying mice. They camp in
batches, usually seven or eight, in tree
hollows where there is plenty of decaying
wood ; this has probably something to
do with their vile smell. And they usually
select trees easy to climb for house-
keeping purposes, such as bloodwood,
gum and Moreton Bay ash, preferably
one that leans. Occasionally the
feather-tails camp in hosts. One host
occupied a very large and very rotten,
heavily-leaning old bloodwood that a
bushfire demolished within 100 yards of
my N.Q. home a few years back. Driven
out by the heat and smoke, the panicky
parachutists dived for safety in all direc-
tions. All the flying-mice in the neigh-
borhood must have inhabited that one old
tree.
* * * *
“Bucko”: “Yarragundry” is surprised
(B. 25/4/’34) that a cod should swallow
live bait head first. That seems to be
the way in which all fish take live bait.
Isn’t it for that reason that a prawn is,
when dead, threaded tail first on to the
hook, and when alive just hooked through
the tail? Small fish, when used as live
bait, are always hooked up through the
tail, and a live frog is hooked through
the back.
* * * *
“Woodki”: The amount of punish-
ment sharks can stand is amazing.
I was fishing for them outside
Sussex Inlet with a mate who’d been
badly scared by a shark in the surf near
Sydney. He asked to be allowed to kill the
first shark hooked ; and we handed it
over to him—a grey nurse about eight
feet long. After nearly 70 savage slashes
with a long, sharp knife, it looked a
very dead and punctured menace. When
we cut it loose, however, it floated only
a moment before swimming diagonally
towards the bottom. A few minutes later
we saw the cut-up one chased to the
surface and torn to pieces by a much
bigger shark.
* * * *
“Dweller”: The only explanation I
can give of how “Barang” (B 30/5/’34)
found several John Dory, deep-sea fish,
in shallow water is that they were there on
business. The John was the fish that lent
St. Peter some brass when he was broke
to the wide ; the spots on the sides of
his flat body are the marks of Peter’s
thumb and forefinger, with which he
lifted the fish out of the water prior to
taking the cash out of its mouth with the
other hand. It is only theory, but I can-
not get rid of the notion that the Johns
were hanging about the beach on the off-
chance that the saint or some disciple
might hop along to repay the loan.
* * *
“Trepang”: While poisoning rabbits in
the Arran district (Q.), I noticed that
many of the young ones had patches of
black fur on them, while others in places
were of a tabby color, and seemed to
have peculiarly shaped ears. Being
curious, I sent one of each color to the
museum, which came to the conclusion
that they were the result of a love affair
between a tomcat and a doe rabbit. An
Arran resident told me that after a
severe bushfire some years ago many
wild cats took refuge in rabbit burrows.
* * * *
“Humo”: The natives of Madina,
New Ireland, before going shark-fishing
dedicate themselves to a term of segrega-
tion in a tambu house, where they fast
and practise exorcism. Then they set
out, with much ceremony, in a ten-man
canoe symbolically carved for the event.
On reaching the fishing-ground each
man takes a hoop of lawyer cane, to
which are attached mussel-shells; the
hoops are vigorously shaken under the
water, and by this expedient sharks
are attracted from the depths. When
one is seen the hoops are withdrawn, and
hundreds of small fish and shells, sus-
pended from the end of a bamboo pole,
are swayed about just below the surface to
imitate a school of fish. Thus decoyed,
the shark swims to the side of the
canoe, and breaks the surface with its
head. It is skilfully lassoed with a
rope hung from the centre of a wooden
contrivance eight feet in length, similar
to a propeller blade. The rope is so
cast as to pass over the head and dorsal
fin, but should it fail to go over the fin
a native will jump into the water and
adjust it. The position of the propeller
prevents the shark from diving, but not
from towing the canoe for miles at speed
before it becomes exhausted. The return
of the fishermen is celebrated in the
usual Kanaka fashion—beating of drums,
blasts on conch-shells and a “sing-sing.’’
THE TREES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The wall is new, but the trees are old;
They remember land where no city lay,
And their gnarled boughs grieve over yester-
day,
The dawns unfettered, the sunset’s gold.
And the river wandering among the reeds.
See the oozing gum where the old heart bleeds!
Through its many rings it recalls the hour
Of tufted grasses and blossomed bush,
The close-knit scrub with its scented hush,
The wattle breaking in golden flower;
And the smell of mortar comes sour and thick
From the high new wall and the bright new
brick.
The trees remember how black men came
With spear and woomera in the sun.
But the white man rules And the black is
done,
And the trees remember these things with
shame.
When the young moon dips to their leafy crest
You can hear them murmur “Old times were
best.”

LEAVES FROM THE PAST.
lll.— Golden Days.
As everyone knows, gold wasn’t really
discovered in Australia at all—it was
discovered in California. But for the sake
of argument it is perhaps as well to
record that the first discovery of gold
in Australia took place at Bathurst,
Orange, Goulburn, Lewis Ponds, Ophir,
Black Rock, Ballarat, Njookenboroo and
Nunjikompita.
It was nothing new. The stuff had
been known for centuries (it was used
for making pocket-portraits of the king,
and is still used for politicians’ passes,
fillings for teeth, bookmakers’ watch-
chains and fountain-pen nibs).
It was probably the novelty that
appealed more than anything else,
because after a while enthusiasm waned,
and nowadays most of the places men-
tioned have given it up and are devoted
to farming and grazing.
But while the gold rush lasted things
were fairly willing. The first thing to do
was to peg a claim. You then had a
stake in the country. Having pegged your
claim, you next secured a miner’s right.
This entitled you to shoot anyone who
came on to your claim, and to be shot
if you went on anyone else’s claim. Of
course, at times miners were shot on their
own claims, but, on the other hand, occa-
sionally a miner went on another man’s
claim without being
shot; so on the
whole the system
worked fairly well.
There were several
ways of getting gold.
The crudest method
was to dig and dig
and dig. Perhaps
you found some
gold this way, but
more likely you did
not. In the latter
case you threw up
your claim and left
the diggings, and
someone else picked-
up your tools and in-
variably turned over
a big nugget with
the first shovelful.
This was the second
way of finding it. If
he were lucky he
managed to reach
the bank with it. If
not, someone else
did. This was the
third way. A varia-
tion of the miner’s
right provided that
a man with a valu-
able nugget could be
shot anywhere,
whether on his claim
or not. The fourth
method was to win
it at the gaming
tables, either from
the man who found
it or from the man
who found it on
him. Much gold
was won in this way. The final method
was to steal it from the escort en route
to the Mint.
It was all the same to Queen Victoria
which way you got it. It all found its
way to the Mint in the end, and emerged
adorned by her prim portrait.
But, alas! those days are gone. Gold-
mining was once a sport, a pleasure, a
pastime. Then it became an industry.
Now it is a profession, and is carried on
in the main streets of the capital cities,
and more gold is put into the mines than
ever comes out of them.

QUID PRO QUO.
“Salvador has formally recognised Man-
chukuo. ” —‘ ‘Herald.”
The Japanese Envoy clanked into the
throne-room of the Imperial Palace and
surprised Mr. Pu-yi, who was busily
engaged with a crossword puzzle.
“Great news, Hen!” he cried, slapping
his Highness on the back.
“Say on,” replied the Emperor.
“Salvador has recognised Manchukuo.”
“Who is Salvador? I’ve never heard of
him.”
The Envoy stood aghast. “Gosh! I
thought you was a learned guy,” he re-
torted, bursting into English.
“What’s the good of all y’
books? Here’s a guy comes
along an’ reckernises you, and
y’ gives him the glassy. What
sorter Emperor do y’ think you
are? You’re no better than an
ornery king.”
Pu-yi looked up from
“Who’s Who.” “He’s not men-
tioned here. He can’t be worth
bothering about.” A sudden
gleam of hope came into his
eyes. “Perhaps it’s a country,”
he said, “welcoming us into the
comity of nations.” He seized
a gazetteer and turned the pages
feverishly.
“Ah! Here it is.”
The Envoy looked. “Bunk!’
he said. “That’s the Yewnited
States.”
“No, further down,” replied
Pu-yi. “This little spot along-
side Guatemala.”
“Looks more like a blob of
ink to me. What do we do now
we’ve found it?”
The last of the Manchus
conned further reference-books,
and clapped his hands together.
“My secretary,” he cried. That
worthy entered.
Pu-yi read aloud:
“Salvador threw off the Span-
ish yoke in 1821.”
“What about it?” inquired the Envoy.
The Emperor ignored him, and turned
to the secretary. “Send a circular letter
to all embassies,” he directed: “ ‘Manchu-
kuo recognises Salvador’s independence.’ ”

I ride it to the place where my day’s toil
will keep me mustering, branding and

tossed with a mysterious coin, but re-

after many false-alarms, two batsmen
disguised as radio announcers started

their innings. It is not known which side
batted, but somebody bowled and hit
somebody else on the leg. A cry ol
“Howzat?” came from nowhere. .The
umpire, in accordance with the new
secrecy rule, refused to say whether it
was out or not.
At the luncheon adjournment the
players left the ground by a secret tun-
nel. It is not known whether Larwood
is playing, but a player disguised as an
Adelaide stockbroker was hit on the
head after the game had been resumed.
At first it was feared that he would be
unable to bat in the second innings, but
later it was discovered that the second
innings had been played first to avoid
detection in case of an innings win.
The bowler afterwards refused to state
whether he had a sore toe or a poultry
farm.
The match is unlikely to end for some
time, as a deadlock seems to have been
reached. The official scorer has refused
to disclose the state of the game.

COMPLETE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE SINCE 1882
N SW-MONT DE PIETE
D. and I. Company Limited
Paid-up Capital:£3oo,OOO
When, as far back as 1882, N.S.W. Mont de Piete
came into being, it immediately revolutionised the idea
of money-lending which had been current for cen-
turies. On May 4, 1882, the following Directors
were appointed: Hon. S. H. Terry, W. H. Paling,
Esq., T. Thompson, Esq., A. H. McCulloch, Esq.
The objects of the Company were: To end usury;
treat the public fairly; operate on sound and honest
principles—the basis of all successful enterprises.
Loans may be regarded as a saleable commodity,
and it was only to be expected that the public would
place its confidence where it could secure loans at the
lowest rates of interest, on the easiest terms, and where
it was assured just and considerate treatment. N.S.W.
Mont de Piete is a Public Company, registered on
the Stock Exchange. N.S.W. Mont de Piete regards
every applicant for a loan as a valued client to be
treated at all times courteously and confidentially.
It is an all-Australian organisation, its complete capital being subscribed by
Australians and all its employees being Australians.
Loans arranged on
Furniture,
Pianos, Players, etc.,
without possession.
In this branch of its activities
N.S.W. Mont de Piete has been
an incalculable help to many
householders.
Money is advanced on Furniture,
Pianos, or any such security while
their use is retained in the home.
Thus one may raise a worth-while
sum to tide over difficult periods,
while continuing the even tenor of
home life.
For this service, N.S.W. Mont de
Piete charges the lowest rate of
interest and allows the easiest
terms.
Complete reassurance is provided
in all transactions with N.S.W.
Mont de Piete by the fact that it
has a fully paid-up capital of
£300,000 and has built its long-
established business on friendly and
lenient methods. The dealings of
N.S.W. Mont de Piete are on
Of N.S.W. Mont de Piete, The
Bulletin, recognised as a sound
and conservative financial guide,
says: “N.S.W. Mont de Piete
is an old and successful concern,
and CHARGES SO MUCH
LESS per cent, than the average
that it deserves success. This
Company, without a doubt,
carries on the business ON
THE STRAIGHTEST LINES.”
the same dignified and unimpeach-
able basis as one may expect at
any bank, for business with the
client is just as valuable to N.S.W.
Mont de Piete as its financial aid
is to the client.
N.S.W. Mont de Piete refuses
to charge usurious rates of
interest.
If the risks that would be incurred
by accepting any security make
exorbitant interest essential,
N.S.W. Mont de Piete frankly
refuses to grant the loan, its con-
tention being that the object of a
loan is to relieve the situation, not
to add yet a further burden of
interest.
Money lent on
Jewellery & Diamond
- Goods
at lowest rates.
Many people, even when not
actually in need of money, utilise
the facilities provided by this ser-
vice of N.S.W. Mont de Piete.
Jewellery, Diamond Goods and
other negotiable assets, instead of
lying idle, can provide money for
investment or personal ,use, while
remaining in the absolutely safe
possession of N.S.W. Mont de
Piete.
The rate of interest on such
pledges at this long-established
House is only 6d. in the £, the
lowest available, while larger
amounts are obtainable at even
lower interest.
All pledges are held for six
months—or longer by arrangement
•—while the greatest possible valua-
tion is placed on all articles sub-
mitted.
N.S.W. Mont de Piete also grants short-term loans on all classes of approved securities.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Carrying lOst. 31b. —61b. more than his
Grand National Steeple impost—Pacto-
lus scored at his first outing over Flem-
ington fences. Sent out a hot favorite
iJ he Ho P etoun Steeple, the Rossendale
gelding took command early, but was
joined at the abattoirs by Trafallable,
son of Trafalgar. It became a two-horse
race from that point; locked level, they
cleared one obstacle after another. Pac-
tolus drew away entering the straight,
but Trafallable is game, and Dynon had
to use the whip unceasingly on Pactolus
over the last two furlongs. If he had not
shifted out a little in the last 50 yards
Iratallable must have won. Many spec-
tators imagined that he had done so, but
the rivals were wide apart and the judge
alone could decide. He gave the race
to Pactolus by a head, and had to submit
to hooting as he left the box.
Trafallable will meet his conqueror on
31b. better terms in the G.N. Steeple-
queer handicapping ; three miles and a
furlong should suit him more than it
will Pactolus. Heavy losses were in-
curred over Royal Visitor, who bumped
Brady out of the saddle at a fence oppo-
site the stand. Miserable displays were
given by the remaining G.N. aspirants,

with the exception of Howrah, the
gigantic son of Tomatin finishing third.
The York Hurdle contest was just as
exciting. Backed down to 9t04 in a
field of 11, Sarokos carried his rivals off
their legs, setting up a lead of 20 lengths
in the first mile. Old Home, followed by
Nyerimilang, began to lessen the gap
with six furlongs to go, and half-way
down the straight Sarokos was tiring;
but, ridden out with hands and heels, the
favorite scrambled home by a head. His
time, 3min. 36|sec., is a course record
lor two miles over hurdles.
It is hard to imagine Sarokos seeing
out three miles. Nyerimilang will come
down 51b. (to lOst. 91b.) in the G.N.
Hurdle, and has list lib. in the second
leg of the National double. He will take
a lot of beating on July 7. Prismatic
headed the unplaced division and will
benefit by the outing. When moving well
Lamroi came to grief.
It has been repeatedly stated that if
Baanya keeps winning on the flat he
will be withdrawn from the G.N. Hurdle.
The brilliant victory achieved by the
Salatis gelding in the Sandringham Han-
dicap suggests that he will be deemed
too valuable a galloper to resume duty
over the battens, first money in the
I S^ dle bein § little mor e than
11000. There are few good flatracers in
commission at present—outside of
sprinters, at' all events.
Two big betting coups were landed-
on Titanium, supported from 20 to 1 to
half those odds in the Rothsay Handi-
cap, and on Babble Boy, 33 to 1 to
B’s in the Buckingham Handicap. Bought
by Woodmason for lOOOgns. at the
Sydney sales in 1933, Titanium is by
Heroic from Winter, by Cooltrim
Babble Boy, by Windbag—Miss Tres-
sady, belongs to P. G. Hay, the brewer.
He did not race last season, but has
developed into a useful three-year-old.
Winter form among the two-year-olds
is never highly regarded, but Mitebite is
smart. On a sodden track she won a
race for youngsters at Ascot in runaway
fashion, at 5 to 2—her third victory.
Blueville, who is related to Nightmarch,
was a poor second, and Short Wave
third. Mitebite, who cost 60 guineas is
by Moabite from Volume, by Valais from
Pamphlet, by Linacre.
Newcastle-owned and -trained Prince’s
Promise (7 to 1) was suited by the soft
gomg, and led all the way in the Ascot
Handicap, Mountain View and Juliet
Glass being his nearest pursuers. The
heavy backing of Milantheon was a sur-
prise ; he finished fifth. Confab may have
been closer but for interference at the
turn. Prince’s Promise, who carries the
colors of Mrs. V. Lewis, is by Promised
Land, a noted mudlark.
Both divisions of the Welter Mile went
to heavily-backed horses—Moallin (evens)
and Tui Mint (6 to 4). Tui Mint has won
twice since carrying the colors of Rand-
wick trainer Pat Nailon. Heavy tracks
suit him.
Backers were also well on the mark in
the divisions of the Flying Handicap. In
one Zeus (9 to 2) was an easy winner
from Sky Brightener and Royal Park,
and Firecello, carrying the Valamita’
colors, annexed the second division at
eights, after being backed from twelves.
She runs her best races at Ascot. The
third heat went to Greencorn (6 to 4)
who had a lot in hand.
Tiger Kelly (5 to 1) made every post
a winner in the Novice Mile. He is a
promising galloper by imported Dignity,
a son of Gainsborough. Raleigh tried to
race with Tiger, but had had enough half
a mile from home.
*. * * *
Leading throughout, Mount Dangar (3
to 1) won the A.J.C. Hurdle Race at
Rand wick in fine style from Abbot’s Lad
and Master Colin. The favorite, Blue
Ensign, was beaten half a mile from
home and finished fourth. Gadray lost
his rider at the turn. Mount Dangar
who is trained at Moorefield, was ridden
by ex-pony jockey A. Knowles. He is
in the G.N. Steeplechase.
The Bulletin had a notion that Tur-
bine was returning to form, and he
proved it in the June Stakes, which he
won by a head from Le Touquet, with
Matoota a long head away. Turbine
went out at fours, but better could have
been got. Leila Vale, Frimsel and Wol-
Jun, each heavily backed, never got into
the picture. Veilantif, who drew outside
marble at the barrier, was fourth.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Obviously too strong and too experi-
enced for Walter Browning, Bill Beth
"f r to P la y llght to make their affair
at Leichhardt look like a match. It was
as slow as cold treacle till the fifth
round; then the American picked
Browning up in a crotch-hold and for-
ward-slammed him for the only fall.
“Whiskers” Blake won on a foul from
George Tiki at Newtown. The Maori
would punch.
Woodfull’s Men
The Australians, McCabe excepted,
did nothing to write home about
against Lancashire at Old Trafford.
McCabe, again in first, this time with
Woodfull, played an admirable innings
for 142. Woodfull failed to better 14,
and Darling flopped for 5. Kippax got
20, but it was a very poor showing.
Other nervy exhibitions were given
by Brown (19) and Bromley (17). Chip-
perfield shaped well until he went l.b.w.
for 14. Barnett came to the rescue with
a tradesman’s innings of 52 n.o. at
stumps, when the score was 8 for 335.
Baxter, a Scottish amateur fast bowler
who is qualifying for Lancashire and
played by courtesy of the visitors, got
Woodfull, Brown and Darling in a few
overs for 38, but had to retire with a
sprained ankle. He bowled well against
our 1930 team for Scotland.
* * * -i=
“Old Q.”: I am in complete agree-
ment with a recent Bulletin contributor
who scoffed at the subsidiary team of
medicoes, masseurs, veterinary surgeons,
chiropodists, chiropractors and experts
in orthopaedics which nowadays follows
our sixteen Australian cricketers round
England, in strong contrast to the days
of the Gregorys, when 12 men played
twice the number of matches and carried
on with sticking-plaster and arnica. The
latest temperamental manifestation of
our flannelled heroes is an objection by
manager Bushby to the town clock at
Nottingham, which kicks up an infernal
row with chimes and striking for most
of the day and night. The cricketers are
housed at an inn just opposite the clock,
and the Mayor of Nottingham has been
asked to cut off the deafening noise dur-
ing the first Test to let the Australians
have a chance to sleep. He has per-
tinently answered that the clock doesn’t
perform between 11 p.m. and seven the
next morning, and that that should be
enough shuteye for anyone.

Footbrawl
With only three Vic. League games on
Saturday, the crowd decided that the St.
Kilda v. Footscray affair promised best,
but most of the 31,000 were disappointed.
After the first interval the Saints did as
they hked, running out on top with 155
points to 84. The Carlton and Fitzroy
barrackers who trooped into ’Roy’s
ground saw a pretty game and a
close finish. ’Roy had been walloped
by Footscray, St. K. and Melbourne,
and didn’t look to have Buckley’s
chance against the Blues. It was a
ding-dong go, but ’Roy’s pace told, and,
though at one stage a goal would have
given the Blues the lead, in the end ’Roy
won by 102 to 87. The barrackers rushed
« .§ rou nd in delirious joy and carried
off Bunton, Shenfield, Cordner, Pye and
others shoulder-high. Hale, Crisp and
Kelly were the best of the Blues. South
Melbourne visited Hawthorn and had no
trouble in keeping on top throughout
winning by 144 to 92. Pratt kicked 7
goals, but Green (Hawthorn) notched 8.
* * * *
Inter-State Rugby Union was played
in four States on Saturday. N.S.W. and
Queensland clashed in Brisbane, Ma and
Victoria m Sydney, South Australia and
Vic. in Melbourne, and Melbourne Uni
and Southern Tasmania in Hobart—an
Australian record.
In Brisbane N.S.W. won a hard and
fast match 26-23. It was 11-11 at half-
t^le N.S.W. back division estab-
“an ascendancy in the second half
and though hard pressed at times, weath-
ered the storm. Ma scored 6 tries to 3,
but gave away a lot of points for per-
sistent offside play, Mackney being the
chief offender. White was in splendid
form on the Light Blue wing. Wallaby
Donnelly landed 4 p.gs. and converted a
try for the home side.
In Sydney, on the muddy North Shore
Oval, Victoria showed the N.S.W. second
team the meaning of forward play. Pack-
ing the South African 3-4-1 formation,
the visitors beat the home side at all
points save hooking in the vanguard work.
They were outmatched in the inside backs,
and these saved the day for Ma, Biilmann,
Cowper and Walker on the wing doing
fine work. The Victorian left winger
A. L. Ward gave the crowd something
out of the common. Fast and cat-footed,
he has mastered the now-forgotten knack
of coming infield when jammed on the
line and going inside his pursuers. Three
of his runs were dazzling, and two ended
in tries for his side. Ma won 17-14 (5
tries, 1 converted, to 4 tries, 1 converted)
and should be truly thankful.
* * * *
At Sydney Cricket Ground the Light
Blue R.L. side met Queensland in a
dull, slogging game with occasional bright
interludes. The ground was in very poor
condition, and concerted work was almost
impossible. Queensland made a fair match
of it forward, but the home backs were
far too clever and fast, the polished play
of the Rugby Union-trained Beaton being
the feature of the match. Smith at full-
back. for the visitors was outstanding on
his side. Ma won 13-0, and on a dry day
would have piled up a much bigger score.
As it was, of the three N.S.W. tries
one was converted, Brown adding a p.g.

“Amateur Pro.”: Those French foot-
ball enthusiasts who foolishly lent an ear
to the sirens of the English and Aus-
tralian Rugby Leagues are wishing they
hadn’t. Recently the French Football
Federation denounced the professional
code and all its works, and has followed
that up by flinging into outer darkness
the individuals and clubs who had any-
thing to do with the attempt to establish
the game in France. Curious that this
code, in spite of many attempts to estab-
lish it elsewhere, has only found root in
Lancashire, Yorkshire, N.S.W., Queens-
land and a small section of M.L.

Racquet and Bawl
After reaching the finals of the French
championships both in singles and
doubles, the Australians flopped. Craw-
ford, reported as done to a turn in the
concluding stages, went down to the Ger-
man Von Cramm in the singles, the sets
going 6-4, 7-9, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 in the Ger-
man’s favor. In the doubles, the old firm
of Brugnon and Borotra disposed of
Crawford and McGrath 11-9, 6-3, 2-6,
4-6, 9-7.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: One matter in connec-
tion with our Davis Cup team in Europe
suggests that the team’s organisation is
not what it has been cracked up to be
by an enthusiastic press. Both at Bourne-
mouth and in Paris McGrath had strings
in his racket broken. One would have
thought that the management would have
had half a dozen of his special weight and
balance waiting for him. Far from it. At
Bournemouth he had to borrow a banjo
from Joan Hartigan, and in Paris
another from Turnbull. This is sheer
carelessness and neglect on someone’s
part, and spanking is called for.

The Australian Universities’ boatrace
on the Murray at Mannum (S.A.) saw
Adelaide win the 43rd event all the way
in 15min. 33sec., extra fast time for the
three miles. Sydney, Melbourne and
Westralia followed. Queensland and
Tassie did not compete. This is Adel-
aide’s first win since 1920.

Australia took its week-end score
against Middlesex from 2 for 135 to 345
on the Monday, Bradman finishing a
hilarious hit at 160. Kippax rejoiced his
backers with a prettily made 56—Darling
had only added a couple to his Saturday
score—and then Chipperfield and the
batsman-’keeper, Barnett, tacked on 35
and 40. All were out for 345, Smith
(4-99) and Enthoven, the old Cambridge
captain (4-59), taking the wickets. The
Lord’s wicket by this was living up to
its reputation. Grimmett (5-27) and
O’Reilly (3-34) diddled Middlesex out
ror 114 in its second shot. Twenty-
nine were wanted for a win, and Darling
(9) and Barnett (14) got them without
loss.
* * * *
Cricket in England last week was
marked by a welter of run-getting, and
the Surrey-Australia match at Kenning-
ton Oval was no exception. After Hobbs
had gone for 24, Sandham and Gregory
mastered the Australian attack and had
279 up before Gregory departed for a
sound 116. Sandham, here with Arthur
Gilligan’s 1924-25 team, played a patient
and steady shot for 219. Barling (44) and
Holmes (28 n. 0.) helped the score to 475
for 7, when skipper Holmes closed.
Chipperfield took 2 for 48, Wall 2 for
105 and Grimmett 2 for 113. Woodfull
changed the batting order and sent
McCabe in with Ponsford. The pair got
busily to work and, when Ponsford de-
parted with 125 to his credit, the board
said 239. McCabe and Bradman went
lor the bowling regardless of risks, and
Bradman left at 369, after scoring a
smashing 77. Kippax failed, bowled by
l ast bowler Gover for 5, but Chipperfield
(34), Bromley (56), Oldfield (33 n. 0.) and
Grimmett (25) kept things going, McCabe
being finally disposed of by a boundary
catch for a fairly lucky 240, made in 345
minutes and including 29 fours. Wood-
full went in fourth wicket down, but
just broke his duck. Bromley showed
dash and hit very hard. All were out for
629. Gover, a young professional who
last year took 98 wickets for the county,
bowled very finely to take 5 for 147, and
may win to Test honors this season
Surrey’s second knock saw 162 for two
wickets at stumps, Gregory again battting
well for 59 n.o. Match drawn.

“Aigburth”: Interest in the county
matches preceding the Test has practi-
cally vanished, since England has already
selected its Test team to all intents and
purposes. The England side for the
toals against the Rest is that chosen by
The Bulletin last week, save that the
Yorkshire slow bowler Mitchell takes
the place of Robins. Langridge was also
omitted to let Larwood in, in addition to
Nichols, but, since it is officially an-
nounced that the much-advertised Notts
man cannot play, it is likely the Sussex
all-rounder will find a place. Play opens
on June 8 at 11.30 a.m., and on subse-
quent days at 11, finishing at 6.30 p.m.
Footbrawl
rc V.F.L. has found
itself bumping trade-union solidarity.
The trouble is the presence in the South
and North Melbourne League teams of
several players who toil in other spheres
during the week, but have omitted to
join the necessary unions when requested.
Negotiations are pending, as the diplo-
mats say.
* * * *
“Huon”: Minor football history was
made in Hobart last week when a team
of Melbourne Uni. Rugby players met
one from the Tasmanian foundation in
the first inter-State R.U. match staged
in the Speck within the memory of the
oldest inhabitant. The visitors won 41-0,
but the young Tasmanian side stuck to
the job and only allowed 14 points in the
second spell. Melbourne is one of the
strongest sides in the Victorian Union.
“Tout”: The N.S.W. Rugby League
has just experienced that treatment from
an ungrateful child which is supposed
to give the serpent’s tooth a stone and
a beating. Country towns have spirited
away dozens of Sydney players, being
helped in this by the extra-hard times in
the city. Last week the newly-formed
Country League rubbed salt into the sore
by taking steps “to prevent the stealing
of country players by Sydney clubs”!
No clearances to players desiring to flit
will be issued on any account.
The Nineteenth Hole
Jim Ferrier, of N.S.W., crowned a
triumphal visit to Queensland by winning
the State amateur championship from J.
N. Radcliffe, 4 and 3. Ivo Whitton, holder
of the title, did not come from Mel-
bourne to defend it, but he would have
had to play wonderful golf to down the
Manly youngster if he had. Ferrier
had previously taken the open title and
the foursomes, in which he was part-
nered by T. V. Healey, and his outstand-
ing superiority to the opposition aston-
ished the big gallery which followed all
his matches. Ferrier’s putting in par-
ticular was consistently accurate.

Once more Britain had to kiss the
amateur golf championship good-bye,
the usual American walking off with the
pot. Though Michael Scott was unable

“Afraid I sink too many this morning.”
to defend it, British players did much
better than usual, eliminating the big
American contingent, with the exception
of Dunlap and Lawson Little. Little’s
opponent in the final was an artisan
golfer, Wallace, who had shown fine
form. He was given no chance what-
ever, Little overwhelming him 14 and 13.
The scoring was a record for the historic
event, and a huge crowd was given the
thrill of its life.
* * * *
“Brassey”: A double-barrelled tour-
ney, the N.S.W. Cup and a professional
purse, was held on the N.S.W. club’s
course at La Perouse and drew a good
entry of amateur and professional
players. The Cup went to J. Barkell, of
Katoomba, who won by a stroke from
L. Meyers, of North Brighton, with a
card of 137 for the 36 holes. A. N.
Waterson, the young Moore Park ama-
teur, was third, his afternoon shot of 70
being a new record for an amateur on
the extended course. V. S. Richardson
pouched the purse with 143, Soutar run-
ning second with 147.
Racquet and Bawl
“Roland Garros”: The English Davis
Cup holders had an inglorious run in
the French championships, the lot
being outed in singles and doubles before
the semi-finals. The man who took his
reverse worst was Perry, who had hoped
this year to win the French and English
championships—he already holds the
Yankee and Australian titles—and thus
put up a record for lawn tennis. He
seems to have gone to bits at finding an
unexpectedly stiff opponent in the little-
fancied Italian Stefani, and ended up
the show by fainting. It seems to be
a habit of this husky, young gentleman,
and one would venture to suggest a
compulsory course of Rugby Union foot-
ball, preferably in the pack. After a
season of that, if he is still alive, faint-
ing will be about the last thing he will
think of.
*i* * *
“Tete Montee”: It is not reassuring
to read in the cables that some of our
younger Davis Cup players, who have
hitherto shown commendable modesty,
are showing signs of feeling their corn.
It is stated that Quist, in the first round
of the French championships, refused to
play because of a background of dark-
green elms. One would have thought
that this would be an admirable “sight-
board” for a snowy tennis ball, but the
South Australian held different opinions.
He was bluntly told to play on or forfeit
the match, and carried on to win. One
hopes this sort of thing won’t be catch-
ing—the tennis public gets far too much
of it from the self-crowned kings of the
game as it is.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: The Canadians made a
hopeless showing against America in
their Davis Cup tie, and, though they
have to meet the winners of the South
American contests, the Yanks can be
considered home and dried for the zone
finals in Yurrup. The question is who
will be their opponents. Many are back-
ing Australia, but our showing in the
French championships, with McGrath,
Turnbull and Quist flopping to players
we have always considered as second-
raters, was not reassuring, nor was
Crawford’s form as consistent as could
be wished. The Nipponese wisely gave
the French championships a miss, and
got all the practice matches they could
contrive on English grass courts. They
will this week start on the grass against
the Australians with that much in their
favor.
Car and Cycle
“Methuselah”: The N.S.W. competi-
tion for veteran cars in the shape of a
run from Sydney to Bondi came off with-
out any fatalities. Many of the entries
were by the trade, and showed a sus-
picious amount of spit and polish, but
there were several genuine veterans. The
winner was a 1902 Cadillac, whose
owners must be congratulated on the
fact that it scored full points on all heads.
Most of the others were mere pups in
point of age, a 1908 Hupmobile, which
came all the way from Moree and looked
it, being the only one besides the winner
dated under 1910.
* * * $
“Differential”: That reference to the
Australian chassisless car (B. 25/4/’34)
omits mention of an important feature.
This is a transmission system which
eliminates gearbox and clutch. It is a
frictionless centrifugal system which
develops torque by means of balanced
weights activated by planetary gears.
Actually the car has no clutch or
gear-lever, but moves off when the
accelerator is depressed, the gear ratio
adjusting itself automatically. This is an
Australian invention which has been
thoroughly tested.
* * * *
“Whizz”: “Disc Clutch” missed the
’bus when he said (B. 30/5/’34) that
racing-driver Eyston must have been
using a small Panhard-Levasseur car
when he put up a record on Montlhery
track, and added that making cars of
this type was a new departure for the
famous French firm. Eyston drove an
eight-cylinder, supercharged giant. On a
larger circuit the Panhard might have done
better. The little Paris circuit doesn’t
give the big fellows a chance to do their
best. Still, the 200-mile run at 128 m.p.h.
and 500 miles at 126 is better than
American Jenkins’s 124 for 500 miles,
made in a 12-cylinder Pierce-Arrow on
a 10-mile circuit near Salt Lake City
(U.S.A.) —the previous best.
Miscellaneous
“Right Half”: Those who recall the
artistry of the Indian Army hockey team
in Australia some years ago will be glad
to hear that a visit by an All-India team
is practically assured for next year. The
hurdle is the cost, which is put at £2400,
and this will mean that £lOO a match will
have to be pouched. Hockey, like base-
ball and one or two other fine games, is
unfortunate in this country in that the
cricketers and footballers monopolise the
best grounds, which mean so much as
gate propositions. The strictest of ama-
teurs, even paying part of their own
expenses on tour, hockey players deserve
a better spin.
* * * *
“C. 8.”: If experienced aviators had
had the choosing of it, it is doubtful if
the date for the centenary air race would
have been fixed for October. This is
the month when the route to Aleppo is
particularly beset with fogs and cloud
wrack. Between Aleppo and Basra south-
east gales rage, and the desert rises in
vast quantities into the upper atmosphere.
Karachi is then beset by duststorms, and
Calcutta will just be finishing its annual
affair with the monsoon, when circular
storms are a feature of the landscape. In
October the Straits of Malacca are in a
specially nasty mood. The mighty rush-
ing wind known as the Sumatran visits
Penang in that season. And afternoon
thunderstorms may be confidently ex-
pected from there all the way to Singa-
pore. Java’s skies will open their flood-
gates daily from a villainously low ceil-
ing, and thus it is likely to be all the way
to Darwin. Flying enthusiasts will get
all the excitement they are hoping for
in their daily papers.

long, trouble-free mileage at a remarkably low cost.

THE MAN ON
THÈ LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS KINSEED MEAL
BUTTER-FAT INFLUENCES.
“W.D.McC.”: Tell “C.P.” that I did
not misunderstand “Bahb Dwyer’' (B.
16/5/’34) when he said that breed was
the dominating factor in butter-fat pro-
duction, and that feed made little if any
difference to the yield. That is only a
half-truth. If it were true, it would be
easy to breed a herd of record-breakers.
The best-yielding herd in the land will
degenerate into a mob of moderates in
the hands of an unskilful owner.
No dairyman can afford to feed a
balanced ration at the present price of
butter-fat (about 6d. net) if he has to
buy concentrates at current prices. He
must grow his balanced ration on his
farm.
“C.P.” asserts that the Friesian and
Ayrshire will not give the test of the
Jersey or Guernsey, however fed or bred.
But the butter-fat producers in the Old
Country are the Scottish Ayrshires. They
have repeatedly gained highest honors.
The highest-testing and largest herd in
Victoria and perhaps in the world is Mr.
W. Gunn’s 190-odd of Ayrshires at
Leongatha.
“C.P.” will find just as many duds in
the jersey and Guernsey breeds as in any
other.
If I were beginning dairying again,
with the experience of a lifetime to work
on, I would secure a farm in a good rain-
fall district or in an irrigation area ; I
would establish and try to maintain a
reserve (over and above my annual re-
quirements) of at least one ton of sound
oaten hay for every cow on the place
as drought and bushfire cover.
I would sow on fallow all the maize,
millet and Sudan grass I could, to ensure
plenty of fodder in the summer months
when the grass dries off, and, if possible,
I would irrigate.
In Jan. and Feb. I would get ready
for the autumn and sow Algerian oats,
barley, Italian rye grass and Berseem
clover. I have grown all these and many
other fodder crops successfully, and if
they are top-dressed with super, and
sulphate of ammonia you will rarely have
a total or partial failure. These crops
should provide ample feed well on into
the winter, and then in the slack months
one can, if necessary, draw on the
reserves of hay.
RAM-BUYERS’ TROUBLES.
“Jumbuck”: “Dead Finish” (B.
9/ 5 / ’34) complains of the class of rams
coming to north-western Queensland and
attacks stud - breeders' sheep classing
methods.
The art in ram selection is to procure
adaptable stock. Unless the purchaser
knows the conditions under which the
rams were bred he cannot judge this.
Sales of rams from several of the lead-
ing studs in N.S.W. were just recently
held at Hughenden, Longreach and
Blackall, comprising good-quality fine-,
medium- and strong-woolled types. There
was the opportunity for “Dead Finish”
to inspect and buy rams right at his back-
door. But, like many others, he believes
in going far afield. The results are only
what can be expected.
Anyway, there is nothing to prevent
“Dead Finish” from getting his rams
from Queensland studs. Rams of the
three merino types are produced at studs
almost in his own district. Their quality
is high and they suit the environment
in which they have to exist, as is evident
from the prices paid for them at the
Longreach sales, where they topped the
market.
CRUTCHING V. JETTING.
“Crutchem”: There is much argu-
ment about it; but to my mind crutch-
ing is definitely the better for ewes
because:
(1) Ewes are cleared of wool at the
crutch preparatory to lambing-time,
which most graziers will agree saves un-
told trouble when the flies are bad.
(2) The crutchings are usually fairly
clean and sell well under normal condi-
tions.
(3) The process reduces the amount of
dirty and stained wool at shearing-time.
(4) Better prices are obtained, although
the wool is shorter.
(5) Crutching prevents the fleece wool
from getting messed by the working of
sheep in the yards, or whilst holding
them in the shed at shearing. Both these
factors bear on the ultimate price at auc-
tion.
Anyone in doubt should go to a jet-
ting shed whilst shearing is in progress
and note the pile of dags and spoilt wool
at most of them, especially in a flush
season. If the dags are removed in the
paddock before shearing, much wool
goes with them, and is wasted. The
crutcher has it in his bales, and the
cash in his pocket.
Jetting cannot give all-year-round
immunity, and the fly trouble becomes a
problem at times, which often results in
losses that could be avoided. If the
sheep are uncrutched, then this problem
is made much worse for both the owner
and the sheep’s health.
TREE BLOWFLY ARGUMENT.
“G.H.H.”: Those who argue about
the effect of retained timber on the blow-
fly pest forget that there is an astonish-
ing variety of blowflies confused under
one name. Using Froggatt’s names there
are the English blowfly (two species),
the reddish blowfly (two), the golden-
haired blowfly (about ten), the yellow
house blowfly (about eight) and the grey-
striped blowfly (about 24). Only a few
of this host are primary flies and still
fewer are “strikers.” , •
Practically all striking flies seek open
spaces, the others mainly sticking to
wooded districts. In hot, dry weather
adults which fail to find shelter and
moisture die off rapidly, but a depleted
district becomes populated again in more
inclement seasons by migration from the
woods.
Harmless blowfles are so like the harm-
ful ones that they are readily confused.
RABBIT PROBLEM.
“Valerin”: As a member of a P.P.
board in control of one of the largest
mixed-farming districts in N.S.W., I know
there are hundreds of settlers who have
not the means to deal satisfactorily with
their rabbits, and the mortgagees will not
help them. We realise that they are a
menace to adjoining landholders, but
what is the use of prosecuting them and
inflicting fines which cannot be paid? It
seems to me in these cases the mort-
gagee and mortgagor should be made
equally responsible.
With so much loan money for unre-
productive jobs, the Government might
consider a plan to make long-term loans
at a low rate of interest to help hard-up
settlers to clean up their properties. Such
advances to be a first charge on the land
and to be expended under the super-
vision of local boards.
“Granova”: Have “Valerin” (B.
11/4/’34) and “Albarmount” ever tried
fumigating? To eradicate rabbits from
1000 acres of rough country, we spent £2
on a calcium cyanide blower and £5 on
dust. Two men and a lad with dogs took
three weeks to get all except the strays.
A trapper (receiving no pay) spent three
weeks on the area. When he had finished
not a rabbit could be seen.
If the rabbits have access to high
country it is a waste of time to fumigate
the burrows on the flats in wet weather.
The rabbits are not “at home.” I have
proved it by digging out active warrens
after heavy rains and finding them un-
occupied.
MARKET HIDES.
“Wahre Kind”: After careful flaying
—the first essential —immerse hide in
water in a vessel sufficiently large. After
10 minutes’ soaking, work thoroughly in
the water to ensure cleansing.
Now drain well by hanging over rail,
and spread carefully on a perfectly flat
surface, skinny side up, and sprinkle
uniformly with about 91b. of coarse salt
(or as size demands, 91b. being enough
for an average bullock hide). Fold in
half lengthwise, and allow the salt to
work at least three days. Open and re-
move all salt by vigorous sweeping with
a rough broom, birch preferably. Again
hang over rail, skinny side out, or till
dry, but not too much so, as folding is
much easier and neater with hide only
moderately stiff. Folding should be done
in the ordinary manner, “bibling” to a
parcel about 2ft. x Ift. Always keep
skinny side out.
REDWATER.
“Rocky”: Despite “Cockyson” (B.
9/5/’34), a redwater outbreak is not
always among cattle from clean country
or which have been kept tick-free by
dipping. In the Queensland central
coastal district, graziers always have ticks
to contend with, and despite all their
experience they cannot avoid losses by
redwater.
Here are two recent examples.
A grazier purchased steers from a pro-
perty 20 miles away. His own and the
place where the cattle were bought are
tick-infested, but he lost a big percentage
when he shifted the stock to their new
home. Both owners, too, use similar
dipping practices, operating about once
every three weeks in summer and occa-
sionally during the winter.
Another cattle-owner kept distinct pad-
docks for breeding and fattening, and
on shifting some steers to his fattening
areas there was a heavy loss. The pad-
docks were adjacent, and the stock did
not change owners.
Many similar experiences in C.Q.
could be quoted. Local graziers think
that in some places there are different
degrees of infestation. Also the C.S.I.R.
has shown recently that there are several
varieties of redwater, so that immunity
from one species is not protection against
the others.
The most up-to-date practice is to
inoculate first with mild and afterwards
with more virulent blood. This again
proves the need to guard against differ-
ent degrees of infection.
CUTTING OUT CATTLE.
“Lion”: Galloping them out of the
mob does not do fat beasts any good,
although the work calls for spectacular
horsemanship.
When drafting off fats for a buyer or
stores, try this method. Walk the wanted
ones quietly out of the mob into a bunch
close to their mates, and leave them in
the same paddock. They usually stand.
Then slip in behind them and drive them
quickly out of the paddock. If the job
has been properly done they are out and
away before they themselves are aware
of the fact. Two men are best at this,
one keeping the “cutouts” together whilst
the other walks them to him.
These remarks don’t apply to large
stations where man-shy beasts have to
be handled.
We fatten a large number of cattle
each year, and, knowing that one day
they will have to be sold in small drafts
as they fatten, we ride among them fre-
quently until they are used to our com-
pany.
This pays us well, because as soon as
the buyer notices how quiet they are he
is immediately attracted. He knows they
won’t get knocked about much, which
is important to a butcher who makes a
quick turnover. People remark on the
quietness of our stock ; yet we buy on
the open market.
BURNING OFF PASTURE.
“Bahb Dwyer”: Queensland dairying
districts have enjoyed almost too-boun-
tiful rains during the past summer.
Where full advantage has been taken,
haysheds and silos are well filled, but
in too many cases not only has fodder
conservation been neglected, but a ple-
thora of long, rank grass is militating
against growth of valuable winter feed.
Good growth is showing in a few places
where burning-off was resorted to, but
that doesn’t make burning-off as a prac-
tice any less regrettable. Fire leaves only
the ashes containing the inorganic por-
tion of the crop —all the other valuable
feed and fertilising constituents go up in
smoke. True, a lot of rubbish is got rid
of, but for the most part it’s rubbish
that wouldn’t be there under proper pas-
ture management.
We must learn to use the mower a lot
more to convert surplus grass into
meadow hay and silage. The use of
pasture harrows to break up and distri-
bute manure and clumps of matted grass
follows as a matter of course. Elaborate
and expensive equipment is not neces-
sary for a start —near-miracles of pas-
ture improvement have had their begin-
nings in home-made harrows and other
gadgets.
COMPRESSUM V. DILATATUM.
“Maria R.”: “Compressum” (B.
9/5/’34) advocates Paspalum compres-
sum. In my opinion it should be taken
well out to sea and cast overboard
attached to an anvil. This grass is ruin-
ing dozens of farms on the Manning
(N.S.W.).
It grows anywhere from salt marsh to
stones, choking out good grasses. It has
little feeding value in summer and none
in winter.
You can grow white clover with dila-
tatum, but only the mortgage thrives
with compressum.
My property ran 180 head of milking
stock until I introduced compressum. I
now manage to carry 120.
“0.X.0.”: “Compressum” scorns Pas-
palum dilatatum (not without reason), but
advocates Paspalum compressum (carpet
grass) for cow pastures; certainly an im-
provement. But why not have the best
cow grass available —Kikuyu? It stands
heavier stocking, produces a far greater
bulk of better feed, is more drought- and

great results, also on the inland irrigation
areas. At Griffith (N.S.W.) under irri-
gation it has carried 40 sheep to the

SUBTERRANEAN CLOVER.
“The Chiel”: The growing popularity
of sub. clover as pasture is easily under-
stood when its recent performances are
considered. Probably no other plant is
contributing more to pasture improve-
ment in all parts of Australia. It has
revolutionised farm practice in many dis-
tricts.
Although sub. clover is botanically an
annual, its natural habit of reseeding
itself by burying a proportion of its seeds
under the soil makes it really a perennial.
It is this distinctive feature which pre-
vents it from being eaten out in a dry
season.
Sub. clover is a wonderful fertility
builder on worn-out or naturally low-
grade soils.
It is adaptable to all classes of soil
and to a wide range of climates.
It builds up the nitrogen and humus
content and paves the way to introduce
other high-fertility-demanding grasses
essential to a properly-balanced pasture.
For the first four or five years after
the sub. clover has been sown it will often
take possession of a pasture and smother
out the natural grasses. But sub. clover
is in itself a better fodder than most
grasses which it may eliminate, and
death to all weeds and rubbish.
Failure to establish sub. clover suc-
cessfully may very often be traced to the
wrong strain having been sown. Suitable
clovers for various districts and early,
mid-season and late strains are avail-
able.
No prior cultivation is needed for sub.
clover other than harrowing and the
sowing of 21b. to 31b. of seed with lcwt.
to Hcwt. of super, per acre.
The plant will become well established
at the end of the second year of growth.
If a quicker establishment is desired the
land can be ploughed and the clover seed
sown with a covering crop of oats, etc.
In the first year after sowing (in
autumn) the clover should be given a
spring top-dressing of lcwt. super, per
acre. The pasture should then be shut
up and rested to enable it to make a
good seeding.
LIFE OF FARM MACHINES
“H.U.C.”: Evidence received by the
Wheat Commission in connection with
plant depreciation as an item in produc-
tion cost is substantiated in the U.S.A.
At the lowa Agricultural College in-
vestigations on the life, service and main-
tenance cost of farm machinery since
1912 have revealed facts which doubt-
less have local parallels.
The mean life of all machines varied
from eight years for a springtooth har-
row to 24 years for a waggon, with an
average of 15.2 years.
The variation of useful average life of
particular machines showed wide limits
—from five to 33 years. This may be
largely due to differences in the differing
methods of individual farmers. A simi-
lar discrepancy must exist in Australia.
•Emphasis is laid on care in housing
by the facts that the average farm
machine is only used for 16 days per
year, and that its life is not influenced
by the actual number of days it is used
so much as by how it is treated while
idle.
The cost of daily service is in inverse
proportion to the number of days used
per year. For most economical use of
machinery, farmers should have areas
large enough to keep their plant in opera-
tion as much as possible. Many of our
closer-settlement schemes have over-
looked this principle.
Systematic repairing seems even more
important than careful housing, and a
well-equipped farm workshop is not a
luxury.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“A.W.”: For removing chaff (or any
foreign body) from an animal’s eye, use
a piece of lard or dripping on the tip of
finger. Dab quickly.
“Yarra”: Linseed oil is preferable to
vaseline for cows’ teats and bags. It is
cheaper, too. Fresh calves often come
in with hard and dry bags, which, if
neglected, mean sores. At this time of
the year some emollient should be used
on all udders.
“D.D.”: To preserve citrus fruit, pick
it before it is ripe and pack it in boxes
of dry sand. Store these boxes in a dry
shed, and the fruit will keep fresh for
months, provided the climate is not very
moist.
“Shep”: To hold a ram powerless,
stand at his side and, facing the oppo-
site way to him, take a firm grip of
flank and pull upwards.
“Mulgo”: Keep the farm road free of
ruts, roots and hollows. The bumps not
only injure produce, such as potatoes,
pumpkins and melons, but make harder
work for Dobbin, and increase the wear
and tear of harness and vehicles. Half
a day levelling the road occasionally is
time well spent.
“R.C.”: Try this on the gate-opening
horse: Remove the ordinary fastener
and throw a loop of chain over the gate
and post. The moke will promptly lift
the chain. Let him do this a few times.
Then replace the old fastener and place
the chain over the hinge-end post at the
wrong end of the gate. Neddy will lift
the chain, but will find that the gate will
not open. After a few attempts, unless
he is more cunning than most, he will
give up.
“Nyp”: If rails drop out of the mor-
tise holes in the posts, slip a short batten
in between the ends and nail or bolt
them together, thus making a continuous
rail which will hold firm and stock-proof,
even if the posts slip.
“Harrows”: Never travel the harrows
—even between paddocks—on their teeth.
Tip them over, when they will ride more
easily and won’t wear unnecessarily or
tear up tracks.
“Agricola”: The guilty portion of the
chain which chafes a plough-horse will
be evident through the brightness of
parts of it. Cut a strip of sound corn-
bag slightly longer than the links affected
and wide enough to wrap round the
chain twice. With a packing-needle and
twine sew through the material and
through and round the links. Remember
that a horse may rub on his neighbor’s
chain as well as his own.
“K.W.L.”: Here’s a good automatic
pump control for the station which fills
several tanks with separate engines. Run
a wire from engine plug to top of tank
so that it will touch the water when the
tank is full. The engine will earth and
stop when the water reaches the wire.
Make sure the wire does not touch the
tank.
“lan J.”: A home-made tree-puller for
small trees and stumps. Mortise into the
middle of a cylinder of light wood
about 2ft. 6in. long and 15in. in diameter
a long, strong pole about sin. in diameter
at the larger end, so that it looks like
a giant maul. To the other end of the
pole fix a strong rope longer than the
pole. Butt the block against the stump
to be pulled ; raise the pole to the verti-
cal and pass a strong chain round both
pole and stump. A pull on the rope
draws the stump. For larger ones a horse
may be used.
“Jumbuck”: Culling and selective
mating have their rewards, even in coun-
try addicted to droughts. At Mt. Harden,
beyond Blackall (C.Q.), 3920 ewes and
wethers cut 41 bales to the thousand,
an average of over 121 b. per head. The
rams used were S.A. Canoonas.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
('Transferred from Service Department.)
I have a Jersey cow, about five or six years
old. She snpres heavily, sometimes when being
milked, more so after running about. The
milk is pure and she gives quite a lot. What’s
the matter ? —1704.
Snoring in cattle is primarily due to some
obstruction of the air passages. The trouble
may be an enlarged lymphatic gland in the
throat, or a tumor or polypus, usually in the
nasal passages. The most common cause of
glandular enlargement in the throat of cattle is
tuberculosis. Have the cow examined by a vet.

High Cost of “Bonds”
Timberlands Woodpulp, a Sydney con-
cern that planted approximately 40,000
acres in Maoriland with Pinus insignis,
estimates the cost of bringing its plan-
tations to the producing stage at about
£l2 an acre. The land ran into slightly
less than £2 an acre at the beginning.
The company charged bondholders
from £2O to £55 per acre according to
how long the timber had been planted
at date of sale. A total revenue from
bond sales of £1,245,000 is anticipated,
which, on estimates, will leave a surplus
of £750,000 over all plantation costs.
Ordinarily this surplus would have
belonged to shareholders ; but by agree-
ment with bondholders it was decided to
pool resources and to use the surplus to
buy a pulp and paper mill.
A scheme whereby shareholders for-
feited their rights over this surplus, in
consideration of extra shares, was agreed
to last July. Bondholders (who are now
shareholders) will acquire an interest in
the pulping mill to be erected
without further cost to them-
selves. Most of what was ex-
cessive in the price of their
acre-lots is being made good
to them in this way.
Old ord. shareholders have
received no dividends. Though
their capital was written up at
the time of the merger, they
now depend upon the success
of the timber venture for their
profits, the same as those
people who bought bonds.
Timberlands, so far, has
been the exception rather than
the rule in throwing in its lot
with bondholders. Pacific
Forests, which issued only
shares in the first place, is a
concern where those interested
stood to get their land and
timber at cost price from the
beginning. But there have
been concerns charging £3O or
more an acre for timber which
don’t mention rebates in their
contracts, and which, after
provision has been made for
maintenance of the forest and
trustee appropriations, treat the
remainder as the company’s
lunds. Some of them agree to lend hack
to bondholders, in order to erect mills,
etc., the equivalent of what they have
been overcharged ; but that is as far as
their generosity usually goes.
There was some excuse at the begin-
ning for charging high prices for Pinus
insignis acres, because the pioneer
forestry cos. were uncertain as to what
their costs would be. It was best to be
on the safe side rather than let the
whole enterprise fail through lack of
finance. But the £3O an acre usually
named has permitted spendthrift mush-
room companies to spring up, flourish
for a year or two, then fade away. They
might never have come into existence
had the pioneers charged more competi-
tive prices—say, £l5 an acre.
Is the Worst Over?
Up to May 25, 2214 N. S. Wales
farmers had sought shelter under the
Farmers’ Relief Act; 1612 of these were
granted stay orders. The Act operated
from March 1, 1933, and since then 117
stay orders have been removed. About
1500 farmers are thus at present under
the supervision of the Relief Board.
It is difficult to get a true balance
sheet, or even an approximate statement
of the affairs of the wheatgrowers, the
chief worry. For every farmer, however,
who has actually come under the super-
vision of the Relief Act, there are many
in almost as difficult circumstances strug-
gling along by arrangement with their
creditors.
The question arises as to whether the
full damage caused by low wheat and
butter prices has yet been acknowledged
by financial houses and farm suppliers.
The banks are probably in the best posi-
tion ; they lent more cautiously than most
other concerns, and they usually see to
it that they get first charge on the
farmer’s assets. Pastoral supply and
woolbroking concerns would come next,
and then machinery merchants and store-
keepers.
A lot depends upon whether country
storekeepers are solvent after providing
for all doubtful debts. If not, and if
the wheat problem remains with us, the
farmer’s difficulties will be reflected
through the retailers to the wholesalers
and right back to the manufacturing in-
dustries. Numerous bad debts have
already been acknowledged in each case.
It has been to the interests of many
mortgagees, however, to help the farmer
“Qn’y .thirty-nine boh, mister. Wot about malcin’ it two quid?”
keep his property going in the hope of
something turning up. The worth of
many a firm’s assets, whether in the city
or country, will depend upon whether
these hopes are realised.
The sheepman is now in a compara-
tively happy position. He is getting
nearly twice as much for his wool as
he got 18 months ago, and the seasons
generally have been kind. There has
been a lightening in finance charges,
too, while the exchange rate remains
steady at 25 p.c. It is in the wheat areas
where danger still threatens us. Knight
Frank Clark, at the National Bank’s
meeting last week, said the strain of
carrying these farmers remained un-
abated, and that in some cases it had
increased.
Australia planted 14,966.000 acres to
produce this season’s crop of wheat, esti-
mated at 174,363,000 bushels for the
year to June 30 next. If the estimate is
realised, yield will be about 40,000,000
bushels lighter than the previous year’s,
the average being 11.6 bushels per acre,
compared with 13.6 in 1933. Figures for
the States during the latter period are as
follows:
Acreage
Acreage. Bushels. Yield.
N. S. Wales 4,528,000 55,000,000 12.15
Victoria 3,053,000 42,613,000 13.96
Queensland 380,000 4,350,000 11.45
South Aus. 3,800,000 35,000,000 9.21
Westralia 3,178,000 36,900,000 11.61
Tasmania 23,000 450,000 20.00
Fed. Cap. Ter. 4,000 50,000 12.50
South Aus., as usual, is having the
hardest time.
The heavy drop in Australian wheat
and flour exports since the commence-
ment of the season to May 23 is shown
in this table:

compared with 106,660,000 bushels dur-
ing the same period of the previous year.

Australian factory statistics show defi-
nite recovery. In 1932-33 there was an
increase of 673 in the number of fac-
tories (22,330) operating, 34,069 more
hands (370,727) were employed, and an
additional £3,484,000 was paid out in
salaries and wages (£59,416,000). Value
of materials used (£175,149,000) was
up £14,000,000; value of output
(£304,698,000) was £23,000,000 higher.
Woollen mills and the B.H.P. steelworks
are large items in Australia’s secondary
industries.

J. C. and C. A. Fields Investments,
Inc., a Victoria (8.C.) show, can lay its
hands on “millions of dollars” (Canadian
or U.S.A.) for investment in good Aus-
tralian gold propositions of substan-
tial size. This is the import of a letter
from the firm to Vic. Secretary for Mines
Baragwanath. Louis Cutbill, of the
London firm of stockbrokers, is on the
lookout for proved propositions in West-
ralia, where his firm and its associations
already have large interests. The con-
sensus of opinion in London, he said,
was that gold would remain near its pre-
sent sterling price for some years.
* * * *
Australian gold production for 1933
was valued at £6,406,069 in local cur-
rency, as against £5,211,802 in 1932.
sje * ijs . s|c
World output of gold for 1933
has been estimated by Samuel Mon-
tagues at 24,000,0000 z., a slight increase
on 1933. The Empire, mainly the Trans-
vaal, was responsible for two-thirds of
the totql. Value at the old sterling
price (£4 4s. lid. per line ounce) was
£100,142,000.

Australia has won its case for retain-
ing generic names for wines, according to
the reported terms of an agreement now
being drafted in London. Several authori-
ties, however, recommend Australian
vvinemakers to try to develop their own
nomenclature.

Sydney’s tobacco war has meant that
ninepenny lines could be bought for 7|d.
in railway kiosks and most big stores ;
sixpenny packets of cigarettes were re-
tailed at sd. Now all this is to end
if the effort to stabilise prices at Vic-
torian rates is successful. Vic. prices
are a bit below the old-time N.S.W.
rates, which showed the retailer a gross
profit of 21 p.c.
* * * *
The German embargo on wool was
continued until May 31 ; imports are now
rationed according to the available
supply of foreign funds. Hoarding of
woollen garments has begun by Deutsch-
landers in the belief that by autumn only
woollen substitutes will be available.

John B. Orr, of Aberdeen University,
has calculated that between 1913 and
1928 food production increased by 16
p.c., as against a growth of only 10 p.c.
in the world’s population. Wheat particu-
larly outstripped consumption. Still, Mr.
Orr’s investigations showed that a large
percentage of working-class women suf-
fered from malnutrition, owing to the
relative expensiveness of vegetables, eggs,
etc. The high cost of distributing milk
was another big factor.
* * * *
Electric Theatres Pty., a pup of Hoyts,
sold a property at 202 Bourke-street,
Melbourne, last week for something like
£150,000. A department storfe will pro-
bably go up on the site, which at
present includes the Mayfair Theatre and
shops.

“Adelaide”: Had a 70th birthday in
Adelaide, the Charles Birks Co., which
began with one drapery shop and has
now swallowed the whole Rundle-street
block from Gawler-place to Stephens-
place, with 600 people employed and a
share capital of £600,000. Napier Birks
has been managing director for the last
25 years.
* * * *
“C. 8.”: Pilchards are imported in
tins and sold as sardines. Why is there
no local industry? The fish frequent the
Vic. coast in large quantities for six
months of the year. Recently two Aspen-
dale fishermen landed six tons in one
haul—and returned them to the deep.
* * * >- *
There is a heavy demand for butter in
London lately, probably stimulated by
rumors of lower production in Maori-
land and Australia. Denmark’s probable
output, however, is still uncertain, and
the price remains weak.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Sampans Again
“Kaloa”: The sampan question re-
fuses to die. A Brisbane paper now'
publishes a long sensational interview
with a returned soldier from the Solo-
mons who declares that “men composing
the crews of the sampans are spruce naval
officers, not ordinary coolies with a skip-
per.” The story is accompanied with con-
jecture which, whether sound or not, will
not help to cement good feeling. It is quite
likely that some of the commanding offi-
cers of fishing sampans are ex-naval men.
Like Britain and Australia, Japan has a
lot of naval reservists employed by the
mercantile marine. Japanese naval uni-
form is so like some mercantile marine
uniforms that it takes more than a glance,
even by somebody who knows, to tell
the difference. The Japanese fishing and
niarine-product industries are huge, turn-
ing over raw products worth £11,000,000
per annum. Some fishing companies own
vessels bigger than any Australian coastal
steamer. And, as these operate down to
the South Pacific, it is likely that it is
their uniforms which have been seen.
Anyhow, the British Government and
Commonwealth should find out, and
regulate their comings and goings in
British and Australian waters.
“Stuart”: Following criticisms by
Hawker, M.H.R., the suggestion is now
seriously being made in Adelaide that
Centralia should be retransferred to
South Australia. Certainly, a change of
Government might cut out some red-
tape. Tennant’s Creek is a telegraph
station at a strategic point on the O.T.
line, but attempts to build a township
there have failed because, though a
wilderness rings it for hundreds of
miles, the immediate surroundings
have been proclaimed a telegraph .re-
serve. A hotelkeeper who recently tried
to erect a pub there was warned off, and
has set up seven miles away. A store is
to be erected near him—the Common-
wealth Government sees that its telegraph
operators are not softened by the
adjacence of civilised conveniences like
shops. The storekeeper tried to get a
telephone installed, but, although he is
alongside the telephone line and connec-
tion would consist in hitching another
bit of wire to the one that runs to Adel-
aide and Darwin, he has been told that
it will cost £lB9. These pioneers must
be discouraged. Perhaps the best ex-
amples of how the N.T. is governed come
from Alice Springs. Not long ago it
took six weeks of negotiation and a
special ordinance to secure permission
for the innocent inhabitants to conduct
a £5 raffle for a bazaar.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: Papers like “Insurance
Lines,” the official journal of the Queens-
land State Insurance Office, must make
sad reading for the Communists, who
have been conducting a campaign for
civil-servant support based on “the
wretched conditions of lower-paid pub-
lic employees starving under repeated
salary cuts.” The Queensland paper
delights in recording the social move-
ments of the staff—Miss So-and-so, the
junior typist in a country office, is “spend-
ing her annual leave in the Harbor City”
—BOO miles away ; another “revelled in
the surf somewhere during Easter.” But
this bit about the poor female wage-
plugs of Maryborough ought to displease
Russia most:
The only bright spots under the grey
skies were the typists. Very charming they
looked in their multicolored mackintoshes.
There was Miss , in a misty, delicate
blue. Norah N floated by in vivid
scarlet, and Dorah looked a mil-
lionaire’s daughter in a sleek coat of brown
silk. We believe we also saw flippant
scarves floating from their necks.
It’s enough to make a poor, hard-worked
Bolshie commit suicide.
* * * *
“Sala”: Wau (N.G.) did itself well on
Anzac Day. A special blue printed
programme advising all old soldiers to
be present was turned out, and the
reminder that “there will be gold to dig
a hundred years from now, so roll-up*
everybody,” had its effect. Anxious eyes
were cast towards the southern horizon,
however. Had any N.S.W. or Queensland
police turned up, most of us would have
spent the night in irons, for the adver-
tised sports included crown and anchor,
housie-housie and a “dollar you can’t
head ’em.’' They were even more
popular than O’Grady Drill and the 440-
yard Anzac Amble.
* * * *
“C. Coral”: Queensland put an extra-
ordinary railway accident on record re-
cently. At Eudlo, whence a train runs
to Palmwoods, the engine-driver was tak-
ing the staff from the official on duty
when it fell into the creek. Boys dived
for it and officials fished for it without
luck. Trains had to be worked under a
pilot system until an electrician arrived
with a new staff.
¥,* * $
“Wau”: This report from the Man-
dated Territory papers should warn
prospectors who are inclined to rush off
to New Guinea equipped as for an Aus-
tralian expedition:
Reports from Wewak state that a return
of half an ounce per man per day is con-
sidered unpayable, and prospectors are pro-
ceeding to the Yuat River, where better
indications are reported.
It must be pretty poor gold or pretty
expensive living, or both. I’d like to
have my pegs in somewhere in Australia
where I could produce lOdwt. per man
in alluvial. Perhaps it is better other-
wise, though. I might get killed in the
crush.
* * * sj:
“Lugger’s Mate”: Despite the “spon-
sors of Hobart, Gladstone, Rabaul, Dar-
win and Twofold Bay” (B. 16/5/’34) J.
D. Calder is in good company in praising
Cairns for its harbor. British engineer
“Perhaps Mary left you because of the way you spoke to her.”
“Can’t be that, boss—bin clear out with that one bullock-driver.”
George Buchanan did the same. But the
Cairnsites need not take too much unction
into their own holy places for the job.
They have built over a thousand feet of
concrete wharfage certainly, and 200 feet
of an overseas wharf, with sheds, etc.,
that overseas vessels won’t use. And they
have spent a few fortunes dredging the
channel where Nature went slow on the
job. But for years they have been tip-
ping the spoil out to sea instead of using
it to reclaim the mudflats. From the
wharf end to Barron Point an imaginary
line coincides with the low-water mark,
and inside that, at the front gate of the
city, is an area of cra*b-haunted ooze called
an Esplanade. A retaining wall along
that imaginary line would give the city
15 square miles of new foreshore for
parks and playgrounds. It’s an old
scheme and one that is revived every
ten years or so ; still, no one likes the
idea of doing a lasting job.
* * * *
“Hanuabada”: Parkhill’s minions, not
content with their exactions in Australia,
have been suddenly inspired to demand
wireless license fees from Papuan list-
eners. Whereupon the Port Moresby
“Courier”:
We do not admit the right of the Com-
monwealth to collect moneys from the
people of Papua which are placed in the
consolidated revenue fund and in the
spending of which the people have not
the slightest say.... It appears very much
as though the P.M.G. has decided that
license fees shall be collected, and ipso
facto his word becomes law.
Which is just what happens with the post
office—half its regulations and exactions
would not stand fire in a law court. In
any case, the exaction of the fees is ridi-
culous. Papuan residents are almost as
close to Manila and Java stations as they
are to the southernmost Australian ones.
* * * *
“Papaki”: Some of the propaganda
stuff about New Guinea that emanates
from Canberra gives me a pain. A blurb
printed in the Sydney yelper press points
out how extraordinary it is that natives
who a few months ago were actively
hostile to Government expeditions now
welcome them with song and dance and
other tokens of native hospitality. Also
they are now attending the Government
camps and “bringing their little domestic
troubles for the officers to solve.” One
finds that sort of thing among primitive
peoples the world over. It is always
necessary first, however, to implant in
the native mind the fact that Govern-
ment has not only the capacity to kick
recalcitrants, but is ready and willing to
do so if occasion arises. There is no
necessity to be aggressive all the time.
One example of the fortiter in re is
usually enough. It is the man who adopts
the attitude that the native is a man and
a brother and treats him on equal terms
that usually suffers. Queensland can
quote many an instance of that with
Binghi, and in Papua the case of Green
and his police at Tamata stands out as a
a warning against too much of the
honeyed-tongue and the velvet-glove
policy, though it is all right in modera-
tion and in the right place.
* * * *
“II Vecchio”: There is heat other than
the climatic kind in North Queensland.
Following hurried visits of Ministers to
the sugar districts and belligerent words
in Italian newspapers as to what would
happen if the British Preference League
operated to the detriment of Italians,
press correspondents sent south a sensa-
tional wire about Communist manoeuvres
backed by the foreigners of the Innisfail,
who were reported to be supplying money
“plentifully” to the Communist funds.
The “Italo-Australian” calls this a “gross
libel,” and says that an Italian Commun-
ist is an outcast. The latest developrrient
has been the dispatch to the sugar fields
of an army of ten police, who were re-
cognised behind the blinds of a railway
carriage at Brisbane Central as they left
armed to the teeth with cigarettes and
quinine last week. If any southerners
hear rumblings in the North some clear
night they, will know that the barrage
is being put down on the Johnstone front.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
On Thursday, the anniversary of the sur-
render of the Boers, the S’African war
memorial blossomed. Wreaths from the S.A.
War Veterans’ Association, the Fathers’ Asso-
ciation, the Governor and many private citi-
zens who have reason to remember the dis-
turbance that ushered in the century massed
the pedestal of the equestrian statue. At night,
90 veterans dined at the Anzac Club, with
Major Jones in the chair. A procession at
midday of men who fought in, S’Africa mildly
interested the citizenry, to most of whom the
row with Kruger is as remote as the Wars of
the Roses.
A meeting of medicoes called by Dr. McKillop
was held to discuss the Mater Hospital ball.
Leading civil servants and the lawyers also
are pledged to make the affair a success. About
20 debs, will be presented to the Governor and
to Archbishop Duhig. The funds will be de-
voted to improving the children’s section of
the hospital.
Dan Carroll was in Brisbane last week on
his way to. Goodna, to see his eighty-year-old
mother. This lady—widow of a school-teacher
and a school-teacher herself —is in the full
possession of her faculties, and her descriptions
of life in the old days are both interesting and
witty.
Mr. and Mrs. J. Waters, of Graceville, have
their daughters, Mrs. de Burgh Curtis and Mrs.
Val Thorpe—the one from Innisfail and the
other from Sarina —with them for a holiday.
Mrs. Curtis married a son of Ned Curtis, for
many years in the Customs in N. Queensland.
Mrs. Curtis, senior, was a daughter of that
beloved old Irish gentleman Lawrence Smith,
for many years in the Government service in
Brisbane.
Wilhelmina McKerron, a pretty nurse who
hails from Bexley, in Kent, arrived in Brisbane
last week to marry her fiance, Marius Nielson,
a young Dane who is sugar-growing at Pley-
stowe, Mackay.
We are an uncultured crew up here, if what
has been said about Brisbane public library is
correct. Ralph Munn, a representative of the
Carnegie Corporation, pronounces it the worst
he has seen. The library at the Uni. fared
little better. Our librarians aren’t to blame.
They’re starved for funds. Lots of valuable
books in our public library never see the light
of day simply because the wretchedly small staff
never has had time to classify the volumes or
put a catalogue into shape.
Elarriet Stirling, of Adelaide, who has been
associated with the State Children’s Depart-
ment of S.A. for some years, is the guest of
Dr. Lilian Cooper and Miss M. J. Bedford at
their pretty home at Kangaroo Point.
The women’s section of the Social Service
League has been in existence for 37 months.
It has done splendid work, and in the last few
weeks members have been making sets of
underclothes for women and girls. The total is
10,977 garments; and now the stitchers have
begun on boys’ and babies’ clothes. Parcels of
clothes have been sent to Mt. Mee, Mt.
Pleasant, Kenilworth and Mudgeeraba, where
there are new settlements of banana-growers.
Dorothy Jones, daughter of our new Lor’
Mayor, has promised to organise a younger
folks’ committee for the Valley branch of the
creche and kindergarten. The branch com-
mittee entertained her to tea last week.
The C. of E. Grammar School, East Bris-
bane, has . two important additions —Gerald
House, a memorial to Archbishop Sharp, and
the John Darnell Memorial Library. Governor
Wilson opened them and M. S. Herring appealed
to supporters to fill the library shelves. John
Darnell, who left a bequest to the school, gave
a free hand to the trustees in the selection of
the manner in which the trust should be
executed. Most people who
make money in Queens-
land migrate south and
leave their money there, as
Sir Leslie Wilson pointed
out.
The Historical Society
has had some windfalls.
N. Scott, of Nanango, sent
a rare book, “Strange Facts
of Early Australian His-*
lory,” and Roy Monk, of
South Brisbane, contributed
a number of papers of the
late W. J. Thompson, his
uncle. W.J. invented a
hospital bed, and worked
out the first scheme for a
water supply for Brisbane.
The society has rooms in
Newstead House, one of
Brisbane’s oldest and most
picturesque buildings.
The post-graduate course
of the Queensland branch
of the B.M.A. is in full
swing, and members and
their wives are offsetting
the serious part of the
business with a succession
of parties at which Bris-
bane medicoes and their
wives are playing host and
hostess. Festivities opened
with a dance and bridge
evening at Lennon’s.
Evelyn Tierney, who is
to marry Bill Carlton-
Smith, is one of Brisbane’s
most popular girls, which
explains why 11 hostesses
collaborated in arranging a
party at Rowe’s for her.
The wedding will take
place to-day at St.
Stephen’s Cathedral. Paula Boland and Kath-
leen Tierney will be bridesmaids.
Recent entrants for the Marriage Stakes in-

Boys have been pinching the lead from the
roof of our Town Hall. The hall cost
£1,000,000 —-at least, it isn’t paid for yet, but
that is what it would have cost if we had had
the money.
By way of making our new archbishop feel
at home, some ass has had all the trees in
the Bishopsbourne paddock chopped down. The
paddock is no beauty spot, at the best of times;
but with a few gums and pmes about it did
look fairly cheerful.
Mrs. R. Lauder, of Cleland station, Cunna-
mulla, is spending some weeks in her seaside
home at Sandgate. Last week she gathered in
a number of old friends for luncheon and
afternoon-tea under the auspices of the C.W.A.
Each year Mrs. Lauder gives this party, and
the members of the Sandgate and metropolitan
branches of the association roll up in force.
Charles Chauvel and his crowd have been at
Canungra making “Heritage,” a talkie which
deals with the pioneer days of Australia. One
of the papers last week published a picture
in which a settler, quite correct in checked
shirt, wide-brimmed hat and whiskers, is posed
with a miss who wears jodhpurs. Pioneer
women didn’t sport such things.
Four-gun Smith, our Premier, is in Scotland

The Man with the Scythe has claimed Sister
Phyllis Drake, daughter of one of Queensland’s
veteran journalists. Born in Brisbane, she saw
service in Egypt and Palestine, and after re-
turning to Australia was appointed to the Red
Cross Hospital at Leura. When Ardoyne was
opened in Brisbane for the T.B. men, she was
transferred there, and for 14 years did won-
derful work.

A Sydney bowling club has no liquor licence,
and members are in the habit of bringing then-
own liquor and consuming it in the club. The
local policeman says that there is nothing to
prevent a member from doing so, but that it
is illegal for him to give another member a
drink. Is this correct ?— 1727.
Apparently it is, though a Court might decide
otherwise. No doubt the policeman had in view
the provision in the N.S.W. Liquor Act (1912),
Section 149, “If on the premises of an unregis-
tered club [i.e., “unlicensed”] any intoxicating
liquor is sold or supplied to any person, whether
a member of such club or not, the person sell-
ing or supplying such liquor... .shall be liable
to a penalty not exceeding fifty pounds.”
t (1) Is interest derived from an Australian
mortgage taxable if the mortgagee lives outside
Australia ? (2) Exemption, if any ? (3) Rate
payable ? (4) Any unemployment levy pay-
able 7—905.
(1) Yes, for Federal, State and (in N.S.W.)
special income tax. (2) £5O for State, less £i
for every £8 by which the net income exceeds
£5O. There is no exemption for Federal and
special income tax. (3) 10d. in the £ for special
income tax. The rate for Federal tax depends
on the amount of income. State income tax
varies in every State. (4) Special income tax
takes the place of the former unemployment-
relief tax in N.S.W.
Is it illegal for a N.S.W. employer to pay to
an adult less than the basic wage ? —l7OB.
Not if the employee works in an industry
to which no industrial award applies. If an
employee works in an industry to which an
award relates, it is a breach of such award for
the employer to pay and for the employee to
receive less than the rate prescribed, and em-
ployer and employee become liable to a penalty
not exceeding £5O.
Suitable diet for a sufferer from ancemia 7
1734.
Eat wholemeal bread in preference to white
bread, pastry and cakes. Include milk, eggs,
green vegetables, salads and fruits with meals.
Especially useful are spinach, watercress,
tomatoes (skinned), oranges, grapefruit and
apricots. Take fish or lean meat once a day,
and minced or grilled liver twice or thrice
weekly. The liver diet has a marked effect on
true anaemia. For exact dosage the dried ex-
tract is prepared in many forms.
/ propose to use a mattress of sponge rubber
l-jin. thick for camping in the bush. I have
been told it would be unhealthy on account
of the body being completely insulated elec-
trically from the ground. Is there anything in
that contention ? I am subject to slight sciatica
and considerable rheumatic stiffness. —1667.
The electrical theory need not worry you.
The main danger is that such a mattress re-
tains body moisture and perspiration, and effects
may be harmful if subsequent chill is not
avoided. Apart from this, as a rheumatic suf-
ferer you would be well advised to adopt some
such protection.
I have a tin-mining friend who suffers from
silicosis, or miner’s phthisis, and finds breath-
ing in a damp atmosphere a difficult matter.
Are there any localities in Queensland or N. S.
Wales where the air is particularly dry, and
where he could still continue tin-mining ? —1590.
In N. S. Wales the Tingha and Emmaville
districts give best prospects both as to climate
and mineral resources. Write to Dept, of Mines,
Brisbane, for Q’land localities.
(1) Is it advisable to be inoculated against
hay fever ? (2) Would a sea voyage help to
check it ? (3) Would it cause blood pressure ?
—1367.
(1) Provided that post-nasal malformation
does not contribute to hay fever, the pollen-ex-
tract inoculation may be employed with every
prospect of success. Personal sensitiveness to
individual plant pollens and the like is deter-
mined by trial reactions, and from the latter
the initial dosage is gauged. Where the trouble
recurs periodically, it is advisable that the
immunising process be carried out some weeks
before the attack is due—if delayed longer
partial relief only can be anticipated. Obtain
particulars from R. P. Alfred Hospital. (2)
The sea voyage does not constitute a treat-
ment. You simply avoid the pollen infection.
(3) It does not increase blood pressure.

As good as in any other occupation.
Are the machine-guns used for shooting
through the propeller of an aeroplane timed to
correspond with the speed of the propeller ?
If so, how ? —1519.
Generally the fixed forward machine-guns
on an aeroplane fire through the circle swept
by the propeller. The firing of the gun is syn-
chronised with the propeller by means of the
Constantinesco gun-synchronising gear (or C.C.
gear), so that the bullets do not hit the blades.
A cam operated from the engine crankshaft or
propeller shaft operates a plunger, which sends
impulses through an oil pipe-line to another
plunger, which at every impulse releases the
trigger of the machine-gun. Oil is supplied to
the pipe-line from a reservoir under pressure.
The timing of the cam and plunger with rela-
tion to the blades of the propeller is arranged
so that the bullets will not hit the blades.
Machine-guns which are capable of firing in
any direction and do not necessarily fire through
the propeller circle are not synchronised in any
Way.
How is wood prepared to make a school
blackboard ? —1787.
The wood must be smooth and free from
knots, shakes and cracks. Proportions for
dressing are £lb. shellac, ■£■ gallon methylated
spirit, 2oz. lampblack, 2oz. powdered emery
and 2oz. ultramarine blue. Dissolve the shellac
in the spirit. Place the lampblack, emery and
ultramarine on a cheesecloth strainer and pour
on part of the shellac solution, stirring con-
stantly and gradually adding the solution until
all the powders have passed through the
strainer. Stir well and use quickly.
(1) What wood is generally used for making
golf clubs ? (2) Are suitable timbers grown
in Australia ? —1648.
(1) For shafts, American hickory; for heads,
persimmon, oak, apple and dogwood. (2) A
number of N.S.W. woods has been tried, and
one which has given good results is alpine
ash. In Queensland, saffron heart, Queens-
land greenheart, green satinheart, iron spear-
wood, hickory ash, brown tulip oak, rose
almond and grey persimmon are used for
shafts, and kanuka box for heads.
(1) What is meant by “fiddle-back” when
speaking of timber for cabinet making ? (2)
Why is it so called? —lB32.
(1) Generally speaking, any timber showing
a close wavy grain; more particularly applied
to work in which two boards or veneers of
identical grain are placed side by side so as
to show a symmetrical design. (2) Because
violin backs are often made of figured wood
in this fashion.
What kind of fish would be the best to put
in a dam on my N.S.W. property, and where
are they obtainable! —1662.
Freshwater catfish (“jewfish”). Fishermen in
your district would no doubt undertake to
obtain them. You must obtain a permit from
the State Fisheries Branch, Sydney, before any
fish are transplanted, otherwise you will be
liable to a penalty of £lO.
(1) Did the Romans use what we call Roman
numerals for multiplication and division ? (2)
If so, how were those operations performed ?
—1743.
(1) Yes. (2) Mentally the operations were
the same as those at present in use. The nota-
tion, however, was extraordinarily cumbrous—
too much so for reproduction on this page.
Meaning of “ballyhoo” ? —1786.
H. L. Mencken in “The American Lan-
guage” says that it is “a characteristic Ameri-
can word signifying the harangue of a bally-
hoo man, or spieler (that is, barker), before a
cheap show, or, by metaphor, any noisy
speech. It is from Ballyhooly, the name of
a village in Cork, once notorious for its
brawls.”
(1) Number of personnel in all branches of
the Australian defence services ? (2) Number
and types of vessels fit for naval service ? (3)
Number of R.A.A.F. aircraft in service ?
1128.
(1) R.A.N., seagoing, 3250; reserves, 5000.
Military forces: Permanent, 1653 ; militia,
active list (including unattached list), 28,260;
reserve of officers, 7397; senior cadets, 5931.
R.A.A.F. (Establishment): Permanent air force,
officers 102, airmen 788; citizen air force,
officers 49, airmen 261. (2) Four cruisers, 10
destroyers, one seaplane carrier and one sloop.
(3) 59.
What modern Japanese women writers are
the most outstanding in Japanese literature ?
1554.
Yaeko Nogami, of the “bourgeois” class,
Fumiko Hayashi, full of poetical thoughts, and
two proletarian writers, Taiko Hirabayashi and
Yuriko Chujo, have contributed something to
the literary world.
What is the Dewey system for cataloguing
libraries, and how does it operate ? —l3BO.
The Dewey system attempts to divide all
knowledge into nine main classes, numbered
1 to 9; encyclopedias and books of so general
a nature as to belong to no one of these classes
are placed in a tenth class called 0 (nought).
Each class is similarly divided into nine divi-
sions, and each division may be divided into
nine subdivisions, and so on. Thus a classifi-
cation capable of indefinite expansion is t>ro-
vided. Decimals are used for the division. The
books are shelved in numerical order. The
main divisions are: 000, general; 100, philoso-
phy ; 200, religion; 300, sociology; 400, philo-
logy; 500, science; 600, useful arts; 700, fine
and recreative arts; 800, literature; 900, his-
tory (including geography and travel). For
example: 500, science in general; 510, mathe-
matics (general); 511, arithmetic; 511.1, sys-
tems; 512, algebra; 512.3, equations.
Can an individual who passed the final ex-
aminations of an accountancy institute (received
his degrees 18 years ago, but did not con-
tinue membership of the institute ) en,er in ‘°
business as an accountant and use the degree
that he was awarded at the time of passing
the examination ? —1342.
There is nothing to prevent anybody setting
up in business as a public accountant, whether
he has passed his final examination or not,
but he cannot use the degree of any account-
ancy institute unless he maintains his membei -
ship with such institute. Best plan is to apply
to the institute for reinstatement as a member
if you want to use the degree.
I notice the picture called “The Idle Hour
is hanging in the Sydney National Gallery.
Has this been purchased by the trustees, and
is it the picture about which a press contro-
versy raged last year ? —1595.
The picture hanging in the Gallery has been
bought by the trustees, but it is not the same
canvas as that about which the controversy
raged—that is still in the artist’s possession.
He painted another a few inches smaller. There
is little or no difference in the composition
and arrangement, but the color in the second
painting is slightly warmer and some of the
textures are richer.
(1) Where and when was Victor Hugo born ?
(2) How old was he when he died ? (3) Nation-
ality ? (4) Which of his books is considered
the greatest 1540.
(1) Besangon, department Doubs, France,
1802. (2) 83. (3) French. (4) Victor Hugo
was poet, novelist and dramatist by turns, but
his fame rests most securely on his poetical
works, notably ‘.‘La Legende des Siecles.” His
most widely-known novels are “Les Mis6r-
ables,” “Notre Dame,” “Les Travailleurs de la
Mer” and “L’Homme Qui Rit.” His most
famous play is “Hernani.”
Have the following Australian stamps in-
creased in value : (1) Bridge issue, 2d. and
3d.; (2) Kingsford Smith issue, 2d. and 3d.;
(3) 6d. air mail, all unused ? —l6BO.
In Orlo-Smith’s Commonwealth catalogue
they are priced: (1) 4d. and Bd. (2) 4d. and
Bd. (3) Bd. The 6d. air mail is still in use
and can be purchased at face value at any
post office.
(1) Best time to set out new roses in Sydney
coastal district? (2) When to put in cuttings?
(3) Names of half a dozen favorite red roses ?
—1714.
(1) In June, unless the ground is very wet
and cold, when it should be left till a month
later. (2) In March, but well-ripened short
stem pieces will often root in June. (3) Etoile
de Hollande (dark crimson), Hadley (dark red),
George Dickson (velvety crimson), Star of
Queensland (crimson-shaded maroon), Souvenir
de Therese Levet (dark red), and Daily Mail
(deep, velvety red).
(1) How and when should “Lambertiana hori-
zontalis” be struck ? (2) Are seedlings useless
for hedges ?- —1722.
(1) Horticulturists propagate the Cupressus
Lambertiana horizantalis by grafting. The work
can be done in June and July. C. Torulosa
is the variety for cuttings. (2) C. Macrocarpa
is the seedling of the species which grows
quickly in heavy cool soil, but for a perma-
nent hedge it cannot be recommended, since it
dies off after about four years.
(1) Who were Burke and Hare ? (2) What
are the Burke and Hare silhouettes ? (3)
Who made them ? —1578.
(1) William Burke was a murderer. He
was discharged from the army after Waterloo
and went to Scotland, where he lived at Log's
lodging-house in Edinburgh, kept by William
Hare. An old pensioner named Donald died
at the lodging-house, and the body was sold
to Dr. Knox, the eminent anatomist, for £7
10s. This price was considered high, and Hare
then suggested that it would be a good busi-
ness to lure unknown travellers to the lodging-
house, kill them, and sell the bodies. In a few
months 15 bodies at least were handed over.
When they were arrested Hare turned King’s
evidence. Burke was tried for murder and ex-
ecuted in 1829. Hare was put on trial, but was
later set at liberty. (2) and (3) Augustin Edouart,
the famous silhouette artist, attended the trial,
which stirred the whole country, and made sil-
houettes of Burke, Hare and Dr. Knox, Henry
Cockburn, counsel for the defence, and almost
every prominent person connected with the
trial, including one of the jurymen. Most of
these are in the National Portrait Gallery,
Edinburgh.
I have been advised to replace a certain 2mf.
condenser in my receiver by one of 4 mf. capa-
city. Should 1 discard the present one ? —1699.
The present condenser can be retained and
the required capacity obtained by connecting
an additional 2mf. condenser to the two
terminals of the present one.
Does it make any difference to the perform-
ance of a radio receiving set if the connections
of the following components are reversed:
(1) R.F. chokes; (2) ordinary fixed condensers;
(3) electrolytic condensers; (4) smoothing
chokes; (5) tuning condensers; (6) fixed re-
sistors; (7) variable resistors ? —1685.
(1) and (2) No difference. (3) Electrolytic
condensers should always be connected up as
per instructions and not reversed. (4) No dif-
ference. (5) Moving plates connect to frame and
fixed plates to grids. (6) No difference. (7)
When one end is earthed, connect moving arm
terminal to frame.
(1) A few biographical details concerning
swordmaker Andrea Ferrara ? (2) Present-day
value of one of his swords? —1593.
(1) He lived in the sixteenth century, and was
probably a native of Ferrara, a province of
Italy. He worked with his brother, and in
1585 had acquired a great reputation as an
armorer at Belluno. Many of his swords have
been found in Scotland, as well as in the south
and west of Europe. He is said to have tem-
pered his sword-blades by the method em-
ployed at Damascus. (2) There are very few
collectors of these old weapons in Australia,
and even if genuine such a piece would have
to be sent abroad to realise anything like its
world-market value.
Where is the portrait of Andrea Odini ? Could
you describe its composition, give its date and
tell if it is by Lorenzo Lotto ? —1602.
It is in the Hampton Court Gallery, London.
It is signed Laurentius Lotus, 1527, and has
always been ascribed to Lotto. The portrait
shows Odini half-length, seated at a table.
He is a heavily-bearded figure in a rather rich
costume of the period. He is surrounded by
statuettes and fragments of antique sculpture,
and he holds in one outstretched hand a small
statuette which he is looking at in a critical
manner. The color is soft and brilliant, with a
somewhat dramatic effect of light and shade.
From time to time it has been put forward as
possibly the work of Correggio, but there is
considerable evidence that Lotto painted it.
Brief Answers.
W.G.M.: (1) So far as the Old-age Pensions
Department is concerned, pensioners are now
free to deal with their property, but the de-
partment must be notified in the case of a pen-
sioner assigning or transferring a life-assur-
ance policy. If the policy is transferred other-
wise than bona fide and for value, its value
will have to be taken into account in deter-
mining the pension rate payable, and the trans-
feree will be liable for any debt due to the
Commonwealth on death of pensioner to me
extent of the policy’s value. (2) All pension pay-
ments after Dec. 31, 1932, are a debt due to
the Commonwealth and will be recoverable
out of a pensioner’s estate on death after all
other debts have been paid. Any assurance
policy will, become portion of the estate.

THE PALETTE
Daryl, youngest of the four Lindsay
brothers, is, as a painter, as much unlike
Norman as Norman is unlike Lionel and
Percy. Daryl eschews the prismatic colors
beloved by Norman (and by Lionel, on
occasion). Like Percy he revels in quiet,
subtle tones, and achieves them in a
way all his own. The 28 pictures of
his which hang on the walls of the
Macquarie Galleries, Sydney, are the
harvest of travel in England, Ireland,
Denmark and Sweden. Best of the
bunch are river and canal scenes —the
Thames, Stockholm, Copenhagen. Almost
monochromes are these, with distances
and lighting most beautifully managed.
Five studies of Corfe Castle are char-
acteristic. The brightest of them man-
ages to suggest warmth and geniality in
the landscape, even richness of color,
without overstepping the painter’s self-
imposed embargo on bright hues. In
all the exhibits the draughtsmanship is
good, and, if in some of the pieces the
sky outweighs the landscape, the result
is harmonious.
Not since the days of P’ullwood and
Hilder has there been a painter who has
so thoroughly mastered the art of the
monotype as Tom Garrett, 29 of whose
efforts in this direction are on show at
Rubery Bennett’s galleries, Sydney. Mr.
Garrett’s style is particularly suited to
the medium. He is a graceful draughts-
man with an instinct for effective com-
position. He fights shy of vivid colors
save for a very occasional excursion, but
achieves effects of great warmth and
richness in monochrome or in a very
restricted range of sober tints. His most
pleasing essay in monotype is “Morn-
ing,” a woodland scene, in which is
achieved the atmosphere of mysterious
romance that is, or should be, the chief
charm of laying on colors inside out. But
there are a dozen other pieces that stand
out as examples of good drawing and a
fine sense of color. The influence of Corot,
as translated into Australian by Blamire
Young, seems to be responsible for the
Garrett gum-tree, but he uses the grace-
ful mannerism with discretion, and with
it obtains some very delicate and beauti-
ful effects. Prices are about one-tenth
of what would be asked for work of such
merit with a better-known signature.
Melbourne Fine Arts lately broke out
with a show of abo. paintings by Arthur
J. Murch, of Sydney, supplementing a
local boom in the same subject matter.
Murch is more of an anatomist than an
impressionist; therefore his records of
Binghi’s physiognomy are of more in-
terest to the ethnologist than the artist.
The same to his landscapes.
They give the grim topography of the
extraordinary country around Mount
Liebig, 200 miles west of Alice Springs,
with a mapmaker’s exactitude. The dis-
play is full of interest, and one of the
most striking things about Murch’s
blackfellows is their intelligent faces and
their air of human dignity. The types
are almost as varied as in a cosmopoli-
tan crowd, and range from the negroid
to the Semitic. Murch accompanied the
Sydney University Physiological Re-
search parties led by Prof. D vies, and
most of his pictures were painted or
drawn in the sun at a temperature of
llldeg. F.
Alfred Coleman, who has made odd
appearances at mixed exhibitions, lately
played a solo role at Melb. Athenaeum
with 50 canvases. Mr. Coleman has a
flair for pictorial melodrama, but, viewed
in mass, his work displays a distressing
uniformity. This is due, not to any lack
of variation in his subject-matter, but to
the fact that his seas, skies, hills and
shrubbery all speak to the eye in the same
formula. And the formula is not his own;
it belongs to a school which includes
Arthur Streeton and a host of others
who have explored most of its possibili-
ties. There is a limit to the delight that
can be extracted by a sensation-loving
public from a fresh demonstration that
two plus two equals four. Even the state-
ment that one plus three comes to the
same figure is not likely to excite it un-
duly ; and, unless one goes into frac-
tions, there is no other way of presenting
the equation. Mr. Coleman has much
manual dexterity, but it could be em-
ployed to better purpose.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Five thousand went out to Mascot on
Wednesday to see Jean Batten arrive.
Many made a picnic of it, carrying
lunches in paper bags or suitcases. At
three o’clock to the tick Jean’s machine
swooped down as graceful as a bird.
Cheers rose from the crowd. More cheers
when the slim, white-clad girl stood up in
the cockpit and flashed a smiling acknow-
ledgment. Cheers again when, standing
on a lorry, she rode round the barriers
that everyone might see her. The people
were so enthusiastic that the police had
to make a way for her to the official
welcoming platform. Here the Acting-
Governor and deputies of the Federal
and State Governments had their say ; so
did the Aero Club’s president, S. J. Moir.
Mayor Parker gave Miss Batten the
freedom of the city, so to speak, and
Mascot’s Mayor told the world how air-
minded his municipality is. L. G. Schmitt
voiced Maoriland’s congratulations, and
Mrs. J. W. A. Prentice thrust flowers on
Jean on behalf of Sydney Enzedders.
Hector Bolitho was there. Cameras
clicked incessantly. After the heroine of
the day had spoken to London and told
the story of her trip, there was tea in the
clubhouse.
Those who were tied to their homes
or the city got a thrill out of the day.
The inhabitants of Kirribilli, Neutral Bay
and other suburbs near the Bridge
watched the fleet of aeroplanes escort
Miss Batten over the harbor. (Flying-
women Mrs. Terry, Mrs. Lamb and Miss
McKillop were prominent in this part
of the air pageant; so was Kingsford
Smith’s Southern Cross.) Then the
suburban spectators rushed inside and
li§tened-in. In Sydney streets eyes were
turned skywards, and office windows that
faced the route were filled with interested
watchers.
Jean’s eyes sparkle when she smiles ;
her dark hair is bobbed. She has a
beautiful speaking voice and the happy
knack of saying the right thing.
Crowds thronged the Town Hall steps
waiting for the aviatrix to arrive for the
Lud Mayor’s reception, and they stayed
there till after nine to see her leave.
Inside it was a small gathering. While
the mechanics were busy fixing the wire-
less, she read congratulatory cables and
messages and wrote her speech. Premier
Stevens let the country run itself while
he took 30 minutes off to shake hands
with a Jean now all white lace, white-fur-
coated and shod in white and silver. One
of Monte Luke’s pictures shows him, the
Lud Mayor, C. T. P. Ulm and Jean in a
group ; another shows her with the collar
of her coat turned up—this was Mr.
Luke’s suggestion; he says it’s more
feminine.
At eight o’clock Jean favored Aus-
tralia, America and M.L. with an
account of her flight. Kingsford Smith
had cabled from Hollywood. She
thanked him from the Lud Mayor’s room
at Sydney Town Hall, and wished him
success in the centenary race. Then Ulm
had a word with his old pal. The
Mayoress dropped in to offer congratu-
lations on her way to the Last Post Ball.
Most folk were too excited to drink the
coffee so hospitably provided by the
Town Hall.
There won’t be many thrills left for
Maoriland to give its flying daughter.
In Sydney she’s the guest of the Govern-
ment, and Premier Stevens showed her
round Parliament. She has sat in the
Speaker’s gallery; she has walked and
talked with the Acting-Governor and
with the Lord Mayor. Three hun-
dred men sang “For She’s a Jolly Good
Fellow” at the Millions Club luncheon.
The Women’s United Associations gave
her a party.. She was the guest of the
Firm at “White Horse Inn,” and after-
wards at supper. And it will take a lorry
or two to carry her luggage down to the
boat, for presents of dresses, of hats,
of everything are arriving two a minute.
At the Australia the telephone bell rings
incessantly. People climb the stairs or
go up in the lift by the dozen to shake
Jean by the hand. And she has had sq
many silly questions to answer she’ll
be able to sit for an intelligence test any
day.
All who had the slightest acquaintance
with any woman writer claimed friend-
ship last week to wangle a card for the
luncheon to Jean Batten in the Audito-
rium at David Jones’s. Lifts disgorged
hundreds who hung around the stairs for
the noted one’s arrival. Legitimate
w.ws. gave the sign to D.J.’s Miss Quinn,
who nodded to the male keeper of the
stairs ; they were then allowed to mount.
Jean came bareheaded, a high-standing
squirrel collar to her coat. President
Isabel Gullett welcomed her. Mrs.
W. K. Robertson was a speaker; so was
M.L. Parliamentarian R. A. Wright. Jean
told of her flight. The camera clicked
twice. Vinia de Loitte struck up “She’s
a Jolly Good Fellow.” This was unani-
mously endorsed. Then Jean left, carry-
ing an aeroplane in red and purple
flowers.
The whole lunch was staccato, for
Jean had an appointment for just after
two o’clock. But she did clear up the
mystery of her wardrobe. She arrived
at Darwin with only a small canvas bag
holding a few changes, a toothbrush,
a beret and a powder puff, and everyone
wanted to know how she had managed.
She left England in a tweed coat, a pull-
over, a fur-lined flying suit and a short
suede coat. The first she discarded at
Athens, the second the French airmen
at Damascus sent back to London for
her, and the suede coat she left behind
in India. ?
On Thursday the Enzed Womens
Assoc, welcomed Miss Batten at the
Wentworth. The younger members gave
a Maori haka in her honor, and their
guest carried away an armful of red roses
and a Maori doll mascot. A model of a
Maori whare decorated the official table.
Here sat Mrs. J. W. A. Prentice, the L. J.
Schmitts and Premier Forbes’s daughters
Bertha and Jessie, the one in spring-green
crepes, the other in misty blue floral chif-
fons ; Squadron-Leader White and R. A.
Wright, M.P. Speeches a#d dancing
filled the hours with cheer.
King’s Birthday brought Nancy Con-
sett Stephen an 0.8. E. in recognition of
her Red Cross Work. She got her M.B.E.
away back in 1918. Nellie Grant Cooper
gets her 0.8. E. for looking after the
Dreadnought boys and other British mi-
grants. She’s a member of the Empire
Service Club, and of the British Settlers
Welfare Committee. Mrs. Julia Barbara
Waugh, now an M.8.E., is one of the
best-known philanthropic workers in
Sydney. Nellie C. Morrice, another who
has had this distinction bestowed on
her, is secretary of the Bush Nursing
Association.
This is a pencil drawing of Rita,
younger daughter of the late J. A. and
Mrs. E. D. Buckland, of Pymble, whose
marriage to Captain C. W. Thompson,
of the Austra-
-lia n Staff
Corps, will
take place at
St. James’s on
June 22.
She is a
kinswoman of
Thomas Buck-
land, the
banker, who
has just given
£lOO,OOO to the
Govern'm e n t
for the build-
ing of a mental
convales cent
homeatSpring-
wood. All the
Govern m e n t
has to do is
provide a water
supply. They’re
chronic a 11 y
short of water
at Springwood.
Euchora, on
which the
hospital will
be built, is
about a mile
from the
station, and it
has a glorious
view. Half a
century ago it
was the holi-
day home of
the Hon.
James Norton,
one of the founders of Norton, Smith
and Co. Its oaks, cypresses and elms,
hawthorns, camellias and tulips made
it one of the show places of the lower
mountains in an age when Supreme Court
Judges like Alfred Steven and James
Martin were lavishing money on estates
in that part of the world.
There were no expenses in connection
with the Last Post Ball. Hordern Bros,
gave the supper and room, the waitresses
their time, and the Black and White
Orchestra its music. No wonder every-
one looked happy. Jean Batten came
on after the Mayor’s reception, and
the eight debs, got a thrill when they
were presented to her as well as to the
Lud Mayor’s lady.
The naval Randle Fords were there ;
she in moss-green velvets, her wing-
sleeves lined with silver. The army O. F.
Phillipses were among the dancers ; her
frock was a bit of summer sky sprinkled
with silver stars. Mrs. H. C. Norton
secretaried in blue crepes and a velvet
coat. Mrs. I. M. Johnston was in
green velvets. Cecily Wheelihan smiled
above parchment brocades and diamente
shoulder-straps. Barbara Balls was all
forget-me-not blues. Vere Capper wrapped
her slimness in floral taffetas, Mrs, A. 8.
Coleman’s black georgettes glinted gold
spots as she passed, and Marjorie Green-
land’s dress of parchment crepes was all
red, green and blue Chinese sunshades.
Furlough House and the Last Post Fund
benefit.
The Adrian Curlewis couple were the
honored at the Palm Beach Surf Life
Saving Club’s dance at the Blaxland Gal-
leries. He’s president of the Surf Life
Saving Association. His wife’s frock of
blue and silver was eye-satisfying. The
dressing featured all the latest in trains,
bustles, frills and flutings. Helen Wil-
liams’s black and green diagonal-striped
organdie, with its sash of green velvet
ribbons, was one of the night’s outstand-
ing successes. Nancy McNaught’s beige
laces had the neckline weighted with
sable. Cherie King’s anemone-pink taf-
fetas, draped fichu-like round the shoul-
ders, were befrilled and finished with a
large bow. Sheila Lowe’s laces were of
delphinium hue, Mrs. Adrian Odillo
Maher’s silver lamd swished a square,
blue-lined train, and Mabelle Markell was
attractive, as always, in black taffeta and
silver. Mrs. Alrema Samuels adorned
her table with weird-looking fishes stand-
ing high on wire prongs stuck in a bed
of deep-sea greenery. The busiest man
in the room was Paddy Kenny, captain
of the club.
The Home Ball drew 500 to David
Jones’s. Mrs. Lewis G. Cohen, in lark-
spur-blue georgettes, received the 11 all-
white debs., who entered the ballroom
through arches of pink and white chry-
santhemums. The ball is the annual
effort of the Jewish community for the
Montefiore Home for the Aged, and Mrs.
Cohen is the niece of the president, L.
M. Phillips. Mrs. Cohen’s mother (Mrs.
F. D. Michaelis, of Melbourne) wore
black velvet. Mrs. Joseph Wolff (Ida
Friedman that was) gave her nice wed-
ding dress of magnolia crepes an airing.
Graceful Rene Lesnie’s trained frock of
ice-blue flamisol flew a cape ; it and the
skirt were ‘edged with little pleatings.
Mrs. Isral Green’s gloves sported silver
lame gauntlets. And enviable was Mrs.
J. Rosenberg’s gorgeous ermine wrap.
Those who have a taste for Oriental
splendor shouldn’t miss Anthony Hor-
derns’ show of carpets, a selection from
which is parked outside the Country Club.
There are real hand-woven silk rugs
from Persia, done in sombre, intricate
patterns that haven’t varied in style since
Omar , sewed tents. They look thin, but
they’ll look no thinner and not very much
older in a hundred years. Then there
are Chinese carpets, which look like
velvet and are in delicate tints and
broadly curving designs. Mother India
does her floor-covering stuff in all sorts
of ways at all sorts of prices, and the
Ellore specimens and the close-woven
dhurrie mats, all bright and beautiful, are
about as cheap a way of making a
polished floor look pretty as can be
found anywhere. Turkey, Egypt, Mala-
bar and Baluchistan contribute character-
istic weaves to the collection, which is
about the most comprehensive ever
shown in Sydney.
Dr. Edgar L. Bainton, the new Director
of the Con., arrived on Thursday, and
took over his job on Friday. Mrs. Bain-
ton has taught music for 20 years, and
believes in singing games for children,
as, they train the ear and allow for action.
There are two daughters: Helen, who is
at present at the Royal Academy in
London, and Guenda, an artist, who
teaches drawing at a school in Birming-
ham. The Baintons are staying at the
Metropole.

Chatter
At the first King’s Birthday race meet-
ing (it was held the day before the
anniversary) the most expensive part of
every woman’s turnout was the shoulder-
to-ear region, for thereabouts the silver-
fox challenged his cocoa-colored brother
and summer ermine flicked a taunting
whisker in the face of squirrel, both
natural and dyed. Elegant new-season
coats, which were everywhere, must
have their feelings considered this year ;
no flowers but orchids may be pinned
to the most exclusive. Lady Hunting-
field, wearing three of these hot-house
blooms, came along early with Colonel
and Mrs. Helme Pott.
In the committee enclosure was the
blue splash of Mrs. John Winter-living’s
hat. She was with her tall, smart
daughter-in-law, Mrs. Bill Winter-1 rving,
whose black coat wore Persian-lamb
epaulettes with military precision. All
in blue, with a silver-fox fur, was Mrs.
Forbes MacKenzie. With her navy suit
Mrs. Joseph Nathan wore a hat with a
turned-up-all-the-way-round brim of the
species known as “school-child.” Mrs.
John Hayne’s “Bronte bonnet” sprouted
a red pompom and ballooning “cock-
erel” sleeves. Very trim was Mrs. Allan
Spowers in her black suit. Out of a nest
of squirrel emerged the spring-green of
Mrs. Norman Price’s hat. Colonel and
Mrs. Tom Slaney were there, she adding
inches to her height with spidery spindle
heels. They supported scarlet shoes to
match a bunch of velvet leaves which
composed her headpiece. Peggy Le
Plastrier’s chin was deep in a lynx fur,
and the rest of her was hidden in a
brown coat. Betty Lawrance’s sky-blue
hat suited her youthful piquancy.
The W. J. vSennitts gave a younger-
generation dance at No. 9. Their daugh-
ter Jeanne was frilled and flounced in
blossom-pink chiffon, her train being a
spiral staircase ripple from the kneeline.
She was made much of after midnight in
the dawn of her 21st birthday. Her
friend Margaret Williams was invited
to make her debut at the party, and
accepted in demure white taffetas with
a little old-world posy. Honeymooners
Mr. and Mrs. J. P. R. Sennitt were
welcomed on their return from Cairns.
When the hostess removed her long cloak
of russet velvet she was clad in flame
matt satin which slipped into a train, a
glitter pf gold being in evidence under
the split back of the corsage.
Mayor Gengoult Smith (not then a
knight—the announcement came on
King’s Birthday) had a welcoming hand-
clasp for each member of the British
Empire Games team at the Town Hall.
Afterwards the athletic young people
were taken off to luncheon at Menzies.
In the evening the aquatic champions did
their bit at the city baths, and were
much warmer in the heated water than
the spectators were out of it. Clare
Dennis had an effortless win in the 100
yards breast-stroke. Lesley Thompson
gave an acrobatic diving display, and her
tiny-tot twin sisters, who show promise
of being as sturdy as young Lesley, dis-
played agility on a springboard as a
result of her tuition. Afterwards there
was a change into evening dresses and
boiled shirts, and a beeline was made
for Leonard’s cafe, St. Kilda, where the
A.S.A. gave a dance. Herbert Maxwell,
the team’s manager, was there ; also the
chaperon, Mrs. M. Watson, who is
going after all.
There’s a family reunion in the R. W.
E. Wilmot household, for Mrs. George
Bemis has come from Boston to visit
her parents, and Mrs. Alan Cobham is
down from Java. Mrs. Neville Wight
rallied to the Quamby Club friends of the
sisters whose homes are so far apart. To
assist chrysanthemums and marigolds to
make a brave showing in the reception-
rooms, Mrs. Wight picked armfuls of red
and yellow berries in her Macedon
garden, and put on a gown of rich
Burgundy coloring. Mrs. Wilmot’s turn-
out of flecked black and white went all
black for its short coat. Mrs. Bemis had
an Air Force-blue tunic suit, under which
was a chilli-red blouse. Round Mrs.
Cobham’s throat was a burst of tartan
against the background of a black
tailored suit. Mrs. John Shaw, Mrs.
Douglas Jamieson, Mrs. Tom Hudson,
Mrs. John Gurner and Mrs. Oscar Lem-
priere sat round the trails of end-of-the
autumn leaves which made a flat decor
upon the tea table.
Lying for years in a corner of the
“Glacie” were polished granite stones
weighing from 301 b. to 401 b., each with a
handle attachment. No one troubled
about their origin or use until Capt. and
Mrs. Moffatt-Pender unloaded similar
“implements” in Melbourne and made
inquiries about the sport of curling. For
the love of the game they started a club
here last year, and have lately returned
from abroad as winners of the Jackson
Cup, the championship of Switzerland.
Curling is on the centenary programme,
teams being expected from Europe and
M.L., so the champions are initiating
those interested into the tricks of the
ancient game on two mornings a week at
the “Glacie.” In the first match of the
season rinks were captained by Gengoult
Smith and president Norman Brookes.
Teams consist of four players, including
a “skip” who shouts directions like “gie
them breeks” and “soop,” which means
“sweep,” for every curler carries a broom
to keep the ice smooth and clear. Capt.
Moffatt-Pender is Scottish, and it was his
enthusiasm which inspired his wife to
practise and become an expert. She, can
ski and skate, but curling is her favorite
winter sport.
The Huntingfields had barely unpacked
(heir personal belongings when the Hon.
Sara Vanneck was whisked off to hos-
pital with appendicitis. The patient is
making a satisfactory recovery.
Crawford Vaughan, formerly Labor
Premier of S.A., and Millicent Preston
Stanley, sometime M.L.A. for Eastern
Suburbs (N.S.W.), were married last week
in Melbourne, choosing the fashionable
St. John’s, Toorak. Both shied nervously
at the red carpet run across the footpath
in their honor, and sighed with relief at
finding that the Rev. Law had left a side
door unbolted. The bride, who was given
away by her nephew, Lieut. Preston Stan-
ley, wore a honey velvet hat of the halo
species and an Arctic fox fur over her
wing-sleeved coat. Luncheon at Men-
zies with a handful of friends was a pre-
lude to a motoring honeymoon.
Here is Laelia Finneberg, whose voice
in several of the 11 languages from
which her repertoire is drawn will be
heard all over the continent, for the
A.B.C. has engaged her to sing in every
capital. By birth and parentage, Miss
Finneberg is English, but she’s Irish by
adoption. As a schoolgirl in Dublin she
made rapid strides at languages, and was
not abashed at the difficulties of Rus-
sian. She has sung to Czecho-Slovakian
and Hungarian audiences in their lan-
guages in Prague and Budapest, and
denies the possession of a temperament.
She is always calm and unruffled, smiles
readily and likes to steal a quiet hour
now and then with a highbrow book.
The Freudian philosophy interests her.
During her schooldays she trained rigor-
ously as a swimmer, and can still get
a good pace out of her crawl. She’s
never done physical jerks, but her last
handicap at golf was 11.
So packed was the Town Hall for the
final symphony concert of the A.B.C.
that the overflow were thankful to sink
down upon the gallery steps. Sir Hamil-
ton Harty looked worn out at the end.
He anticipated the strain, bringing a
supply of collars and shirts and appear-
ing immaculate after each orchestral
group. Laelia Finneberg wore a white
semi-pyjama garment with a finger of
green in the region of its shoulder-straps.
Clinging to a low V at the back was a
train winding over a sinuous green lining.
At the conclusion of the concert Sir
Hamilton departed from his custom of
not making speeches. He commended
members of the orchestra for their pluck
and sporting spirit, apologised for nearly
killing them, and admitted that he’d never
worked so hard as in the last two weeks.
At the supper party following he was
presented with a blackwood cigarette-
box. Prof, and Mrs. Laby, Mrs. Victor
Wischer, Dr. and Mrs. John Shaw, Mrs.
George Swinburne and Margaret Swin-
burne and the Russell Grimwades were
in the crowd.
Miss Jackson, mentioned on this page
as a landscape, gardener who favors
poplars in gardens, denies the impeach-
ment. She likes the tall trees on road-
sides and in parks, but reckons they rob
the soil of too much to go well with
lawns and flower-beds.
After a whirl of good-bye parties
Cynthia Keon-Cohen found herself sur-
rounded by trousseau and wedding
presents and heading for Queensland.
To-day she has packed away the little
hat and stiffened eye-veil in which Ronald
Esler pictures her, and is arraying her
willpwy slenderness in a bridal gown of
ivory satin. The ’groom, who waits at
All Saints’, Brisbane, is also from Mel-
bourne ; he’s Donald, third son of knight
Stephen Morell and his lady. The bride
comes of a legal and brainy family. She
has studied dancing since her childhood
and has not lost interest in her violin
and piano. The ’moon will shimmer
along the romantic Barrier Reef and the
palmy fringe of Papua, and there will be
some of its radiance left for a station
home in Queensland.
Annals of Adelaide:
Florence Austral was accorded a great re-
ception by' Adelaide music-lovers. Our
Women’s Choir serenaded Madame, husband
John Amadio and pianist Raymond Lambert.
The Lyceum Club also entertained the party.
The Moulden lady returned from England in
time to celebrate the coming-oLage of her
youngest daughter Deborah, whose marriage to
Mac Knox is to take place in a few months.
The party was a cheery affair starting with a
dinner at Lordello for 27 guests, the scarlet
decorations matching the frock of matelasse
worn by Deborah Hackett. The Moulden lady
received the guests gowned in black taffeta
figured in beige and red. Patricia Hackett
chose a leaf-broWn crepe de Chine with a
touch of sea green. Other guests came on
later for the dance.
The Unemployed Sales Depot benefited sub-
stantially as the result of a huge bridge party
held at Birk’s Piccadilly. Mrs. Lavington
Bonython was organiser, and the several large
tearooms were crowded out. Mrs. Bonython
and Mrs. F. Barritt donated prizes bought at
the Sales Depot. Mrs. Harold Bickford was
in charge of the sale of sweets, cigarettes and
almonds by a bevy of pretty girls, and demand
outran supply.
Lady Kinnaird, who has recovered sufficiently
to travel, is leaving for England in the Maloja,
accompanied by her son, the Master of
Kinnaird.
A very large bridge party at the Wentworth
was organised by Mrs. S. R. Symonds, wife
of the Naval Commander, to provide funds
for the R.A.N.R. sports committee. Daughter
Kathleen Symonds was hon. sec. About 50
tables were reserved.
The Embassy was crowded for the dance in
aid of the Goodwood Orphanage. There was
a “best-dressed-head-of-hair” competition,
which gave four judges a difficult task.
The Movie Ball at the Palais Royal was the
usual big success. Over 1000 were present,
and various charities benefited accordingly.
The flower-and-cap stall was run by Mrs.
Lavington Bonython, representing the Mothers
and Babies’ Health Association, assisted by a
number of pretty girls. Mrs. H. Maughan,
her daughter and friends did good business
with a cigarette stall. The Regent Theatre
won a prize for a quaint set representing
“Three Little Pigs,” and all the fancy costumes
were excellent.
Cheerful chronicles from the West:
There was standing room only bn the floor
and galleries of Government House ballroom
for the Anzac House dance. A space was
cleared for the entry of the v.-r. party and a
roll of crimson carpet pathed the route to
the dais, flanked with the bright trappings of
naval and military officers who awaited their
partners. After Betty Smith had parked a
bouquet of roses before the Mitchell lady’s
trained orchid and silver lame, 65 buds made
a stately entrance to the accompaniment of
Roy Glenister’s baritone singing “The
Debutante.” Down the aisle they swayed, the
pristine whiteness of their gowns accentuated
by crimson posies. Spotlights shone on the
snowflakes as they drifted by, trembled hesi-
tatingly at the dais and then fluttered into their
places for the official lancers.
Semi-rustic shepherdesses in sophisticated
black and white, flounced, frilled and bon-
neted, ministered at the buffets in the ball-
room, and a continuous supper went on in the
banquet hall. The Eslers, Peggy, Kath and
Rene, put on ballets and ballroom dances and
the Firm lent Billy Milton for a musical
number.
There were 500 responses to J. J. Poynton’s
“tally ho!” for the Hunt Club’s opening meet.
Mrs. Poynton, with lush black fox furs
throttling gunmetal tweeds, handed round the
stirrup cup at the Belmont Hotel, where the
flower-decked tables were well-nigh hidden by
the multitude. Mrs. A. E. Joyner’s feathered
headpiece bobbed up and down and Mrs. E.
B. Sinclair’s beige fur collar was poised oyer
navy cloth. After the quaffing fully one-third
of the party set off with the hounds.
Streamers wound their way through
asparagus fern and balloons bounced about
the Pleiades Club ballroom for the club’s
cheery dance. Stalwart pink gladioli vied with
chrysanthemums in concealing the delectable
supper in the dining-room. President Mrs.
Norton had ruchings of aquamarine organdie
on her dimity patterned muslins; chairwoman
Mrs. Cecil Sweeting wove a colorful mosaic
design on stone marocain; Gwendah Day’s
laces were blush-rose; silver sequins glittered
on Gwen Cash’s pool of turquoise velvet, and
Nancy Craven Griffiths swung a length of
Wolsey-red crepe.
The Karrakatta Club’s choicest rugs were
brought to light and poinsettias and roses
held their heads proudly when the members
entertained Percy Grainger and his wife. Mrs.
D. D. Paton’s presidential browns were next
Mrs. Grainger’s navy blue crepe with its
touches of silk plaid. Tea and talk followed
Percy’s dissertation upon music and his better
half’s anecdotes about their voyage to Aus-
tralia in a windjammer.
Lance Barrett put on an amusing evening’s
entertainment for some 30 guests. The wining-
and dining-table supported posies for the fair
sex and model aeroplanes for the men, and
an adjournment to the Piccadilly found the
ballroom divided into four sections by tapestry
hangings. One compartment housed the
supper, one was a lounge, the third was set
aside for dancing and in the fourth were
screened films and slides which caricatured
the members of the party.
Mr. and Mrs. Jack Scaddan, she with lip-
stick lace emerging from beneath a velvet coat,
announced to a horde of guests a double
engagement in the family. Son Tom has wooed
and won the fair Lilian Turnbull, and daugh-
ter Marjorie has promised her hand to Bob
Nairn.
The J. C. Williamson players were farewelled
with much ado at the Embassy to the winking
of changing colored lights. Iris Kirkwhite’s
bronze-gold hair waved over lichen velvet;
Madge Aubrey’s black satins fell from a cor-
sage of silver; Isabel Mahon’s soft crepes were
in girlish china-blue, and Mrs. Leo Franklin
was wrapped in field-flower matelasse.
From the Speck;
The Midland Hunt Club had a great day at
Andora, near Evandale. A big field turned
out, weather was perfect and a throng in cars
watched the fun from the roads which inter-
sect that part of the country. In the evening
Mr. and Mrs. Carl von Stieglitz gave a jolly
impromptu dance at their home, Andora.
Junior members of the Hobart Rep. Soc.,
with a few of the elders to give backbone,
staged five one-act plays at the Town Hall, fol-
lowing this up with a supper at which a wel-
come was given to Olive Wilton and daughter
Junee. A pleasing new feature of the evening
was the appearance of an orchestra.
Mrs. W. Wolfhagen was one of the many
hostesses to farewell Mrs. G. H. Butler and
Evelyn before their sailing in the Ormonde. The
party was held at the Queen Mary Club. Joi
Chapman and Marjorie Butler were among
those who sped the parting guests at bridge
parties.
Dr. Stoddart Barr was host at a smart lale-
afternoon party at Hadley’s. Dr. and Mrs.
Taylor Young, passengers in the Mongolia en
route for Europe, were among the guests, to-
gether with the Lieut.-Governor and the Lewis
lady, Mrs. G. H. Butler and daughter Evelyn,
Mrs. Minette-Lucas, the Henry Allports, Dr.
and Mrs. Pearson, the Fred Grants, the James
Murrays and Dr. and Mrs. E. A. Rogers.
Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne Uni. rifle
teams were entertained by the Tas. Uni. Club
at a dance in the long library. Supper was
served downstairs, where red and gold and
autumnal shaded chrysanthemums and mari-
golds made a gay effect.
The F. J. Gunns, of Launceston, had a gay
dance for the 21st birthday of daughter
Dorothy at their home, Claremont. The ball-
room was decorated in flaming autumn shades,
and supper-tables were radiant with gladioli and
carnations. The young guest of honor wore a
sheathy trained frock of silver lame with a
shoulder spray of orchids.
Launceston Art Society’s exhibition was
opened by the Governor at the King’s Hall,
and was voted the best ever held. L
Dechaineux went up from Hobart to judge the
exhibits. The v.-r. party (Lady Clark having
gone north also) had tea with the committee
after the speechifying. The water-color section
was strengthened by the work of Mrs. Barnard,
one of the society’s earliest members, who is
revisiting her old home—she now resides in
Queensland. Geoff Tyson, Mrs. Reid Bell,
Stanley Fuller, Mrs. Dechaineux and Dorothea
Keeling also received bouquets from the judge.
Artist Jessie Traill brought her etchings,
water-colors and oils to Hobart after her Laun-
ceston show, and Mrs. D’Arcy Addison made
an introductory speech at the first view at
Hadley’s Hotel.

The Ferry Pirates.
BY J. B. BLAIR.
HORACE MIDDLEBROOK, manag-
ing director of Harbor Ferries,
Ltd., looked worried. Tom Patch-
ing and Alf Teagle, captain and engineer
respectively of the Esmeralda, looked
even more worried.
“Well, that means finish?” asked
Patching.
“Yes. I’m sorry for you fellows, but
you see the position. We’re losing
money, arid we simply can’t afford to
keep this boat going. This will be her
last week. She’ll have to clew' up on
Saturday. If anyone comes along with
£l5O he can have her as she stands.”
He left them and stepped ashore.
The Esmeralda was not exactly the
latest thing in ferry transport. Motor-
driven, she was capable of carrying in
the vicinity of 100 persons, but she was
seldom called upon to do so. The route
she 1 exploited, between Circular Quay
and Gibson’s Point, was not a busy
one. In the morning and 2 late after-
noon she was fairly well. patronised by
the employees of small factories on the
point, but during the day her crew of
three often outnumbered the passengers.
The skipper and the engineer looked
glumly at each other as Middlebrook
walked away. Both had had varied
experiences before drifting into Sydney,
but for several years the Esmeralda had
been a steady job for them, and her
demise would see them on the wharf
again looking for work. Still, there was
nothing to be done about it, so Captain.
Tom Patching told the solitary deckhand
the glad news and they cast off again
for Gibson’s Point.
It was probably only a coincidence
that the meeting of the Surry Hills
Anglers’ Club should have been held that
evening, but. there must have been more
than the finger of Chance in the fact that
Forgie, the energetic secretary of that
body, happened on that day of all days
to travel back from Gibson’s Point. Of
course he was told of the misfortune that
had befallen two of the club’s most
esteemed members. “Stiff luck,” he said
sympathetically. “But what can you
expect from the master-class? He won’t
starve, you can bet your boots!”
“Him starve!” retorted Patching.
“Why, he’s making pots of money out
of the other boats, yet he’s too stingy
to keep this one running.”
Forgie continued: “Under Commu-
nism all transport will be run for use, not
profit, and parasites like Middlebrook
won’t be allowed to batten on the
workers.”
The ferry reached the wharf.
“S’pose you’ll be at the meeting to-
night? We’ve got to fix up about the
fishing trip for Saturday. You coming?”
Rightly assuming that the question
applied to the trip and not the meeting,
Patching replied: “No. We’ll have to
run this blasted old hulk for the last time
on Saturday.”
“See you to-night, then.”
At the meeting that night (Albert
■Sharp, president, in the chair) Forgie
showed that his fertile brain had not
been idle during the day. He was right
at the top of his form, and he laid before
members a plan for the annual fish-
ing trip which brought forth loud and
unstinted applause.
Tom and Alf for. some reason did not
fall in with the secretary’s proposal and
suggested all sorts of objections to the
scheme, but as the rest of the club took it
up enthusiastically it was carried by an
overwhelming majority. Towards the end
of the evening the two dissentients, after
repeated plying with ale, agreed that it
was a great scheme, and everybody went
home happy.
During the week Forgie visited the
Esmeralda two or three times. He also
visited many of the members at their
homes. Several of the members paid
nocturnal visits to the homes of non-
members—quiet, unobtrusive visits, of
short duration.
Whether any of these incidents had
anything to do with the unusually large
crowd that assembled on the Esmeralda’s
wharf at the Quay at 8.30 on Saturday
morning it would be difficult to say, but
the twenty regular patrons were rather
surprised to see so many men, women,
children,, baskets, suitcases and other
impedimenta.
“Must be going for a picnic on the
other side,” suggested one. Others agreed
that that was the most likely explanation.
The Esmeralda drew alongside and the
crowd surged on board, leaving very
little available space for those who were
rushing up at the last minute.
Just as the vessel moved away from the
1 wharf a short, fat, middle-aged man panted
up, hesitated, jumped clumsily, clutched
at the air, and was dragged to safety by
the ever-ready Forgie.
“Gee. Just made it,” puffed the late-
comer. “Not as young as I used to be.
He produced a cigar-case and handed
it to his helpers.
Hiram Pettigrew was not a regular
passenger. In fact, he had never travelled
on the Esmeralda before, but urgent
business at Gibson’s Point had caused
him to rush away from his hotel leaving
his grapefruit almost untouched, and a
gallant sprint had enabled him to make
the passage. .
In Sam Francisco the words “Petti-
grew” and “pickles” were synonymous,
and Hiram hoped as a result of his visit
to Sydney to see his name emblazoned
on every pickle bottle in Australia.
Meanwhile the ship’s complement had
settled down. The regulars were grouped
in little bunches here and there, almost
lost in the sea of strangers, suitcases and
baskets. Hiram seated himself alongside
Forgie.
The vessel was now in midstream and
was heading down the harbor. The
regulars, on noticing this, were somewhat
surprised, as in accordance with usual
custom she should have been heading for
the Bridge. But the explanation offered
by one of their number seemed sound.
“We must be going to drop these
people at Cremorne first.”
But when Cremorne was reached and
passed doubts began to arise. However,
these ; were soon dispelled when it was
argued that obviously the picnickers were
bound for the Zoo.
“But why couldn’t they put on a
special boat, instead of making us all
late for ‘work?” complained a conscien-
tious toiler. . ;
Others'laughed at him.
“What does that matter as long as
you’ve got a reasonable excuse?”
The one or two strangers who were
appealed to merely stared blankly at
their questioners.
Forgie had primed them well.
The Zoo wharf drew near and twenty
pairs of eyes looked anxiously towards
it. The Esmeralda didn’t so much as
turn an eye in that direction but kept
steadily on down the harbor.
A mild panic was evidenced among
the regulars.
“Where are we going?” “Where s the
captain?” “What’s the idea?”
The deckhand was innocence itself,
which was not surprising since he was
beginning to wonder very much whether
he were on the right boat.
The engineer merely replied to repeated
questioning, “Ask the skipper.” And the
captain had locked the door of his glass
cabin on the inside and completely
ignored all knocks.
Things were beginning to get des-
perate. The word “pirates” was passing
from lip to lip, and the twenty worka-
day voyagers were huddled together near
the bow, some of the more venture-
some spirits debating whether they
should smash the captain’s door in and
demand an explanation.
Pettigrew, seated between Forgie and
Sharp, had not noticed anything amiss.
The secretary and president whispered
together, and the latter gave a signal.
Burly passengers surrounded the captain s
cabin, forming a barrier between it and
the regulars. Others grouped themselves
near the engineer. They said nothing,
but their presence had a dramatic effect
on the regulars, who now realised that
their worst fears were only too well
grounded. .
All thought of excuses for late arrival
at shop or office vanished. Here they
were face to face with stern reality.
Kidnapped! And in Sydney Flarbor!
It seemed unthinkable, but these
sinister, grim-faced figures before them
forced home the truth.
A crowded inward-bound Manly ferry
was approaching. The same thought
seized the whole twenty, and rushing to
the side they waved frantically, and cried
in one loud conglomerate voice:
“Help! Pirates! Kidnappers! Police!"
But the forethought of Forgie had not
failed. By this time gramophones in
various parts of the ship were competing
strongly with the portable radio that
someone had just switched on, and a few
of the younger spirits were attempting
some community singing.
As a result the Manly folk heard
only a confused jangle of shouting and
disharmony from the Esmeralda, and the
frantic waving of the bewildered twenty
was absolutely misinterpreted.
The words of Miss Sally Tonkin,
typist, probably expressed the feelings of
all on board the Manly boat.

CRAIG & AITKEN, 654 George Street, Sydney.
Middle Harbor on a glorious day like
this! No wonder they’re excited.”
So with one accord the city-bound
folk waved back to the Esmeralda, now
rapidly approaching the Heads.
Forgie and Sharp again conferred.
Forgie rose and announced through a
megaphone:
“Now, look here, you people! We’ve
borrowed this boat for a day’s fishing,
and you’ll have to make the best of it.
It’s no good worrying about your jobs.
When Communism comes there’ll be jobs
for all. Now, all you’ve got to do to-
day is have a good time. We’ve got
fishing-lines for all, bait for all and grub
for all, and as long as you birds behave
it’s ‘share and share alike.’ But, if any
bloke makes a nuisance of himself, he’d
better look out.”
The shanghaied ones were relieved to
find that “walking the plank” wasn’t
going to be the first item on the pro-
gramme.
A day’s fishing sounded good fun,
though they suspected it was only a blind
to keep them occupied. Probably they’d
be smuggled aboard some windjammer
and would never see Sydney again.
But, at any rate, they all took it quietly.
Not so Hiram Pettigrew. Not know-
ing where Gibson’s Point was, he had
been unsuspicious until Forgie revealed
the truth. Then he stormed. He raged.
He’d come for business, not pleasure.
How could he be expected to waste the
day gallivanting around in a crazy old
motor-boat with a lot of hoboes when
Blenkinsop was waiting for him to sign
the contract?
He made no impression on Forgie.
He made no impression on Sharp.
The burly bodyguard edged closer, and
as he struggled to gain the captain’s cabin
he was seized and held firmly.
This had a salutary effect on the bolder
ones among the uninvited guests, and
there were no further objections.
An hour later the Esmeralda came to
anchor about five miles out from
Cronulla. Fishing-lines were produced
by the dozen, and soon the vessel’s sides
were adorned with the best array of fish-
ing tackle that the garages and sheds of
the stately homes of Darlinghurst could
provide.
The first fish was caught, amid cheers,
by Anita Flaherty, the ten-year-old
daughter of Basher Flaherty, a former
president of the club, and the second by
George Perkins, a clerk in a factory at
Gibson’s Point, where at that very
moment his chief was saying, “Young
Perkins must be ill. Funny he didn’t
ring up though.”
By lunch-time a fairly good haul had
been secured. Hiram had steadfastly
refused to join the sport, and had abused
Tom, Alf and Forgie so much that he
had again been placed under restraint.
Lunch was half over when Anita gave
a shriek.
“Look at the sharks! ”
A school of huge fish was surging past
the Esmeralda.
Lunch was forgotten, and lines were
again thrown out, and immediately a
dozen were drawn in, each with a large
fish.
“Tunny,” said Basher, the acknow-
ledged authority. “We’re lucky—it’s
years since a school like this came here.”
The next half-hour was such as fisher-
men experience only in their wildest
dreams. The decks were soon heaped
with huge fish.
It was too much for Hiram.
“Gimme a line,” he shouted, and joined
in the fun.
Almost immediately he lurched against
the rail as the stout line was almost jerked
out of his hands. Tom Patching seized
the line, and the two of them, with some
assistance from Basher and some well-
intentioned hindrance from everyone
within reach, at length landed the prize.
It was a beauty. Not only the largest
of the day, but by far the biggest fish any
of them had ever seen caught. The whole
company crowded round in an endeavor
to see the super-fish at first hand, and to
congratulate Pettigrew on his catch.
Hiram beamed and handed round his
cigar-case; spoke of fish he had caught
in Florida ; slapped Sharp on the back;
shook Patching by the hand, and thanked
Forgie for inviting him on the trip.
Growing more enthusiastic as he re-
baited his line, he offered twenty-five
dahlars to any guy who caught a larger
fish.
The sport was resumed with alacrity.
The school of tunny was still thick
around the vessel, and the fish seemed
just as eager as ever to be caught.
In the excitement of hauling them in
no one had eyes for the fast launch which
was rapidly drawing near, and which
contained the indignant Horace Middle-
brook, Sergeant Waters and several con-
stables. When first noticed they were
quite near.
Acting in accordance with the best
authorities, the senior representative of
the Law called upon the Esmeralda to
stop. As the Esmeralda had been at
anchor for over two hours this order
seemed hardly necessary. He then called
upon her to surrender in the King’s
name. The Esmeralda’s reply was to
haul up her anchor and to begin cruising
around in circles.
“Hi! What’s the big idea?” cried
Hiram, who had just unhooked his latest
victim, and was about to cast in again.
“We haven’t caught ’em all yet.”
His companions tried to explain the
situation to him, but Hiram was not in
the mood for explanations. The urge
of the chase was in him.
“Stop her! Drop that pick again!”
No one took any notice of him. All
eyes were on the police launch.
Hiram sprang to the captain’s cabin
and commenced talking volubly to Patch-
ing. Meanwhile both craft were cruising
around in circles. Forgie was beginning
to look a little doubtful. The anglers
looked grim. The regulars looked ex-
pectant.
On the other boat things were also at
a standstill. Sergeant Waters had never
been called upon to cope with such a
contingency before. The chase had been
all right, but now he had come up with
the quarry he was at a loss as to his
next step.
The difficulty was solved for him.
The Esmeralda came to anchor again
and a voice through a megaphone in-
vited him to come aboard. At least he
assumed that he was included in the
general term “interfering idiots” to
whom the invitation was addressed.
The police launch was manoeuvred
alongside the Esmeralda, and the ser-
geant, revolver in hand, clambered gin-
gerly on board, followed by two of his
satellites and Middlebrook.
“Arrest them!” ordered Middlebrook,
standing up to his shins in fish and point-
ing at Tom and Alf.
The sergeant went up to Patching.
“I arrest you,” he said, “on a charge
of” The word “piracy,” which he
had been rehearsing all the way out,
seemed out of place on the fish-§trewn
deck, so he concluded: “On a charge of
stealing this ship.”
Patching replied calmly: “I’ve stolen
nothing. I’m master of this boat and she’s
under my command.”
“Arrest him! ” spluttered Middlebrook.
The sergeant pondered.
“Certainly you’re the captain,” he
said ; “but you’re supposed to be running
across the harbor, not going on fishing
trips. You’ve got to do what your
manager tells you.”
“Stop all this ballyhoo!” burst in Mr.
Pettigrew. “This ship’s mine, and I
guess if I wanta take my friends fishing
no guy ain’t gointer stop me. Give him
his cheque, skipper.”
Patching handed a slip of paper to
the managing director, whose face turned
several violent shades of red and blue
before bursting into a smile that, with
a slight stretch of imagination, might
almost have been called angelic.
“Sorry, sergeant,” he said; “a little
mistake.”
“Mistake, is it?” retorted the sergeant.
“Mistake? Well, perhaps you’ll be able
to explain that to the Court. Bringing us
out here on a wild-goose chase.”
But Middlebrook, with a cheque for
£3OO safe in his note-case, was not going
to worry over trifles.
“I think I could explain it better to
you,” he said meaningly.
“All right, then. Get back on board,
you fellows.” And the sergeant and
Middlebrook went into the captain’s
cabin.
When they emerged a few minutes
later the fishing was again in full swing.
Middlebrook glanced at the sergeant.
“Nice day, sergeant. Why not?”
“All right; but just for half an hour.”
Enchained.
If T fled down the misty miles,
Would they waken my lost young mirth,
Since they hold no curb or care
To silence a song at birth,
And nothing to shake belief?
In the sweetness of freedom won
I would find no need for a lamp at dusk
With the glow of the setting sun;
No need for a careful smile,
And never a need to weep
Out there in the night alone.
I wonder if I should sleep
While the trees stood temple-high
In the dark of the summer skies;
And wake in the lilied light of dawn
With the cool dew on my eyes.
And if I were driven in
By the whips of the winter rain,
Should I be satisfied
With only the warmth my gain?
Would I still be wild to walk
To the tinkle of frozen grass,
With the shining wonder of frosted pearls
Where the silvery shadows pass?
But ever I harness up
Habit, my steed, again;
Endurance my only spur,
And patience my guiding rein.

The Greenhorn’s Lesson.
BY CAPTAIN JACK HAMILTON.
FROM the outer anchorage to the far
end of the Dyke, and to Siberian
Stockton on the other side of the
harbor, tall ships, moored two, three and,
in several places, four abreast, deco-
rated the skyline of the port of New-
castle with a forest of spars, rigging and
gaffs from which ensigns, given an airing
on special occasions or on the Sabbath,
floated gaily in the breeze.
At midnight the coal-lumpers had
ceased work for the week-end on ships
loading for South America. Aboard the
fully-laden barque Ravencore, of Glas-
gow, at the same hour the crew had
turned in for a well-earned rest after
making every possible preparation for
her dispatch for Antofagasta as soon as
the Sabbath ended.
Captain Malcolm Bruce, her skipper,
never took his ship to sea on a Friday
or a Sunday.
Now, as the crew lolled in groups for-
ward, or yarned with the men of the
tug Bustler, tied up alongside at the Fare-
well Buoy with banked fires, it seemed
impossible that she had just been loaded
with coal. Her decks were as white as
the sails stretched on the yards above.
In the mid-afternoon sun the newly-
painted spars glistened as brightly as the
polished brasswork atop her capstans.
The well-swabbed varnish of the taff-
and fiferails stood out in bold relief from
the clean oiled deck of the poop.
Presently the ship’s gig, with the
skipper and a new apprentice seated in
the made the gangway.
Before it was fast Captain Bruce raced
up the Jacob’s ladder doing duty for a
gangway and reprimanded the mate. His
eagle eye had sighted three suits of oil-
skins hanging out to dry forward.
“Got the oil frae the locker when the
third mate was doon the peak, did ye?
Stole the oil that the owners paid for wi’
hard-earned money—the oil that micht
one day be needed tae save the ship!”
His harangue caused the curious within
earshot to crane their necks.
“Stealing’s a crime punishable by law.
Bring the three of them aft, mister,”
roared the skipper to the mate, “and
they can tak their choice of paying the
owners a pound by way of restitution or
of ganging tae gaol and losing all the pay
due them. The thieving lubbers!”
As the cavalcade moved aft the new
apprentice, still standing spellbound near
the gangway, attracted attention.
“Stir your stumps and come along wi’
us, young John Macmillan,” instructed
the skipper. “It’s a good chance for ye
tae learn your first moral lesson on ship-
board.”
The chubby-faced youth listened in
awe while the chiding master pointed out
how many a good ship had gone to the
bottom through lack of sufficient oil to
pour on troubled waters. The guilty
mariners offered no excuse nor asked for
leniency. They were aware that they were
not likely to get much sympathy in a
trial ashore, and that opposition to the
punishment inflicted upon them aboard
would produce still worse results.
Captain Bruce read out slowly the
charge he had penned in the official log.
Two men signed it; the third made a
cross. Master and mate attested to all
three, and, as the culprits filed out on
deck, relieved that the ordeal was over,
Macmillan was ordered to take the pen
and add his name as a witness.
“Noo then, ye young greenhorn,” said
Captain Bruce, “ye hae witnessed wi’
your own een the reward o’ thieving on
a ship, and it behoves ye to bear it well
in mind in future. At sea, as on dry
land, ye ken, honesty is aye the best
policy. Ye can pass the lesson on tae
your messmates in the half-deck. Most
of them are capable of stealing the breeks
off a Hielander.”
From the first streaks of dawn the
ship had been a human hive. On either
yardarm, as each sail was hauled out
and stretched, third mate and boatswain
heaved home the earrings to the right
tautness. Their poise, their confidence,
their disregard of the possibility of the
lanyard snapping as they leaned back
with their full weight on it at that giddy
height, balancing jockey-fashion with
their knees, stamped them as experienced
and fearless sailormen.
Cheerfully the men sang at their work
up there, as they did on deck. A mar-
vellous precision was noticeable when-
ever they turned to execute an order
connected with the manipulation of the
myriad ropes and tackles. No one walked
to a job.
The barque Ravencore was on the
eve of sailing—a homeward-bounder.
Not a thought was given by the crew
to the dusty town of Antofagasta, swel-
tering on its Chilean foreshore, which
rain had seldom kissed; nor to the arid
red-brown peaks of the Andes beyond
the town. Most of them had only set
foot ashore once during their stay of
four months —on liberty day.
The rest of the time had been devoted
to work from dawn to dusk, shovelling
four thousand tons of Newcastle coal out
of her holds and loading as much salt-
petre. They were only too glad of rest
when work ceased. And liberty day,
though it lasted twenty-four hours and
they were granted a month’s pay to
enjoy it, went in one riotous debauch.
Far more enthusiastic had they been
when hoisting the last sling of saltpetre
two-blocks —a prelude to their dispatch
noted and acknowledged by every ship in
the harbor. Once the sling was hoisted
all hands took up positions on the fo’-
c’sle-head to answer the cheers from the
other ships which were voiced in orderly
rotation along the tiers of vessels at
anchor in the Roads, each vessel picking
up the cue as her neighbor had finished
her greeting.
At nightfall the applause was renewed
when an array of lights in the form of
the constellation of the Southern Cross
was hoisted to denote that she was about
to leave for home. Cheers from the
Dimsdale, Cedarbank, Loch Lomond,
Muskoka, Howard D. Troup, Sacra-
mento, Mosscraig, Kinross-shire, Mount
Stewart, Comliebank and Beechbank —the
ship that carried a black mate. Cheers
from the Trafalgar, Dudhope, Falls of
Garry, Falls of Hallidale, Port Jackson
(no longer a flash clipper packet,
but a coal and saltpetre drogher
like the rest of them), Marion Josiah,
Marion Lightbody, Thomasina Mac-
lennan, Penrhyn Castle, Lindisfarn,
Andromeda, Amazon, Grace Harwar,
Archibald Russell, Peter Iredale (with
her enormous sheer), Dalgona, Levern-
bank, Fernbank, Arctic Stream, Elgin-
shire, Tamar and Wendur —still proud of
her half-day victory over the Loch Torri-
don in making a passage from Newcastle
to Valparaiso in twenty-nine days thir-
teen hours. Cheers from the Fiery Cross
and the yacht-like, white-painted Crom-
dale.
There was much more in their cheer-
ing than blatant noise. Many of them
had been in company in Sydney or in
Newcastle months before, and had
painted the Sailortowns of those ports
red. All, having had their fill of coal-
and saltpetre-lumping, envied the for-
tunate ship to finish first.
As dusk came on again, with all the
canvas bent and the gear ready for sea,
the decks of the Ravencore became
crowded with visitors —apprentices and
mariners from the other ships. They had
come to take part in a ceremony of fare-
well accorded to homeward-bounders
from the West Coast since ships first
called there to hunt buccaneers on the
Spanish Main.
Some tailed on to ropes and helped the
crew to heave up the anchors and make
sail. Others bestirred themselves to tow
the fully-laden vessel clear of the land
with the oars of their gigs.
From the bows of the Ravencore more
than forty of these tiny craft, manned by
sweating apprentices, who were urged on
by mates seated comfortably in the
sternsheets with tiller or yoke-lines,
radiated from right ahead to a wide angle
on either side of the ship. Each gig
disported four heavy oars, the majority
with two to a blade for greater human
to wing-power.
In striking contrast was the spectacle
in the saloon, where, with Captain Bruce
as host, skippers yarned and drank at
their ease, biding the time when the
human tugboats would shift their weight
with everybody and everything else
aboard. Other than an occasional com-
ment on the prevailing enthusiasm of a
chanty on deck —a sure sign of good
work in progress —they paid heed to
nothing but their own enjoyment.
We’re homeward bound, come give us a song;
Good-bye, fare thee well! Good-bye, fare
thee well!
We're homeward bound, so send her along;
Hurrah, my boys, we’re homeward bound.
Heave her and pawl and walk her around;
Good-bye, fare thee well! Good-bye, fare
thee well!
The anchors are weary of foreign ground;
Hurrah, my boys, we’re homeward bound.
Trudging around the windlass the
chantyman sang the improvised solo,
the others rendering the chorus with vim
as they pushed on the capstan-bars. The
heavy chain cable by slow degrees
clanked up through the hawse-pipe and
down into the locker, after it had been
divested of mud from the harbor bottom
by the wash-deck hose.

The naked eye can’t miss

But where the naked eye sees ugliness,
the microscope sees danger. Magnify film

rod-shaped ones in pairs and groups—
Lactobacilli is their scientific Latin name.
Destroyers of lovely teeth
Lactobacilli are the “germs of tooth decay.”
They feed on the particles of food that
cling to the teeth. They give off lactic acid
that dissolves the tooth enamel, then de-
vours the part beneath. Finally the nerve
is reached, causing abscesses and often
serious infection.
Lactobacilli appear in countless numbers.
In fact, the film scraped from a single tooth
may easily contain millions of living or-
ganisms. The only way science accepts of
removing germs from teeth is to remove
the protective film-coat in which they live
and multiply. Film clings stubbornly. It

That’s why Pepsodent laboratories have

have developed a new and revolutionary
material for removing ugly, stubborn film.
It is radically different from any found in
other toothpastes—different in composi-
tion and in action.
Some toothpastes remove film with
materials so hard that they scratch the
enamel. But the new material in Pepsodent
is soft—twice as soft as the material com-

it shows extraordinary power in removing

The rowers sang, too. Repeated in the
lull between land and sea breezes by
two hundred strong, young voices, with
emphasis stressed at each bend of their
backs, the choruses reverberated from
the lofty mountains, drowning the sound
of the ever-booming surf.
There was something very stately about
the tall ship and her sweating escort
then. Silhouetted against the starlit sky,
her sails, loosed in expectation of the
land breeze, shivered with every cats-
paw and flapped like great idle bats with
every heave of the swell. The moon had
not yet peeped above the steep heights to
(eastward, but a planet converted the
loosed canvas into a thing of beauty.
Ahead the little boats struggled on —
pygmies trying to shift a sullen giant.
After each pull on the oars the
rowers felt their craft bounce back as
if it were attached to an omnipotent
elastic pendulum. A steel vessel of two
thousand seven hundred tons register,
laden with more than four thousand
tons of saltpetre, is not easily coaxed into
motion against a swell with the wide
expanse of the Pacific Ocean behind it.
The voices of the mates grew hoarse
with urging. The sweating rowers ex-
perienced difficulty in retaining their seats
on the slippery thwarts. Their backs
ached excruciatingly. They felt as if
one more bend would break them. Then
the agony wore off. They became lumps
of machinery ; pulled like automatons.
Then, at long last, the climax!
The pygmies had shifted the giant!
On the fo’c’sle-head of the Ravencore
the chantyman signalled his approval by
bursting into a quicker-time melody.
The hooker is moving, so gallop her round—
With a hoo-dah !
The mudhook is lifting away from the ground,
rrom dirty Chilano foreign ground—
With a hoo-dah, hoo-dah, O !
Blow, boys, blow for Californio—
With a hoo-dah !
There’s plenty of gold, so I’ve been told,
it/the hanks of the Sacramento —
With a hoo-dah, hoo-dah, OJ
Gradually as the men sang they in-
creased their speed around the capstan
until they broke into a fast, steady trot.
The pawls clicked merrily, the anchor
chain, freed of its weight, clanked louder
and more rapidly as it ceased groaning
in its passage from the sea-bed. The
mate leaned over the rail waiting for the
anchor itself to show up.
The rowers in the little boats, once
they knew that the tow was on the move,
settled down into an easy, long, strong
stroke.
The moon was rising over the moun-
tain crest. Its mellow lustre bathed the
intervening waters in shafts of luminous
silver, which rippled gently to the wisps
of the waking land breeze. The stars
paled and their velvety canopy bright-
ened. The dark outline of the Andes
stretched to nothingness in the north and
south. The riding lights along the ex-
tended tiers of shipping, the gleaming
avenues of gaunt hulls, masts and spars,
twinkled like large, rare diamonds.
By another change in the tune of the
chantyman the rowers knew that the
anchor was home, and that the hands
had deserted the fo’c’sle-head to hoist
the halyards and make sail.
Whisky is the life of man,
Whisky, Johnny !
We drink whisky when we can,
Whisky for me, Johnny /
Whisky drives dull care away,
Whisky, Johnny !
I thought I heard the Old Man say
Whisky for me, Johnny!
Light-heartedly the gig crews joined in
the chanty. With the zephyrs off the
land picking up and beginning to belly
the canvas, the effort of the rowers
rapidly dwindled to nothing but the pro-
pulsion of their own light weight. Not
until the Ravencore had a good offing,
however, with plenty of sail spread, were
the gigs released as tugboats.
Followed a mad scramble, with the
ship thrown up into the wind, as each
boat made for the gangway to collect a
well-feted skipper and hard-worked
sailors and apprentices, and pull them
back five miles or more into Antofagasta.
One of the gigs picked up the ship’s
agent also. Flushed with liquor, he
dropped a freshly-receipted bill on the
deck. It was promptly retrieved by Mac-
millan, snooping around the gangway to
catch a last glimpse of youthful com-
panions from other ships.
On stepping into the boat the muddled
one dropped the missive again. A smart
lad in the bow rescued it from the water.
The chantyman and carolling crew
made themselves heard above the din
as the all-clear signal came from the
poop, and the ship was brought back on
to her course.
Antofagasta is well astern,
Leave her, Johnnie, leave her !
Never a, flower and never a fern,
Oh, it’s time for us to leave her.
Coal or ’petre all day long,
Leave her, Johnnie, leave her !
The wind blows fair and the wind blows strong,
oo its time for us to leave her.
From the congregated flotilla, satisfied
skippers and thirsty mates, men and
middies awoke the eagles in their lofty
eyries.
“Three cheers for the Ravencore!”
‘‘Hip hip .... hooray !”
‘Hip■.. .hip . .. .hooray J”
‘Hip. • ■ .hip. ... hooray /”
“Ravencore !”
“Adios ! ! !”
Only two voices were silent —those of
the lads who had rescued the bill for
the agent. Their sharp eyes had caught
sight of the contents of the document,
which had been signed by Captain
Bruce: '

ttpOWS,” said Peter Smiley as he
finished his second cup of tea,
“have been the salvation of the
farmer.”
“And the curse of the farmer’s wife,”
contributed Mrs. Smiley as she poured
his third cup.
“Now, now, mother, don’t say that!
What’d you do without the cows?”
“I don’t know,” confessed Mrs.
Smiley; “but I do know I’m not likely
to have the chance to find out.”
Peter chuckled. “I’d hate to see you
at a loss, mother. After all, ten cows
isn’t so many, you know. There’s Mrs.
Kemp down the road milks fifteen, and
makes the butter, too.”
“Yes,” grimly agreed Mrs. Smiley, “and
stands up at night to do the mending,
’cos she knows if she sits down she’ll go
to sleep.”
“Do you think it pays to make butter?”
inquired Tom Bruce. “When you only
get sixpence a pound it seems hardly
worth the work.”
“It isn’t,” said Mrs. Smiley decisively.
“There’s quite enough to do to send the
cream to the factory." When a woman’s
got ten cows to milk, children to look
after and all the other work to attend
to, she’s doing her share.”
Peter laughed and patted his wife’s
shoulder as he passed her.
“Come on, Tom, we’ll go and look at
that cow. The missus isn’t feeling quite
herself to-day.”
“ ‘Look at that cow! ’ Then he is
thinking of buying another. It isn’t
fair,” Mary Smiley thought angrily as
she washed dishes. Petey would be ten
to-morrow, and she supposed he would
have to start milking, but Peter needn’t
go buying more cows just because of
that. She didn’t want Petey to milk, had
refused to allow it when Peter had sug-
gested it before, and had got him to
promise to let the lad off until he was
ten.
Ten to-morrow! Peter must have re-
membered that —she wondered bitterly if
he had remembered to get the lad a birth-
day present. He was a good lad, and
smart at school, and Mary did not want
his schooling to be a drag because he was
called upon to do too much w.ork at
home. It wasn’t right for a boy to have
to milk cows, ride three miles to school
and then do his lessons; ride home, do
more milking, and then more lessons at
night.
Grimly she shut her mouth. Petey
wouldn’t milk more than one cow, and
that an easy one, and Molly wouldn’t
milk at all until she was twelve. And not
then if Mary could help it.
She looked round the kitchen as she
put the dishes away. It was a nice
kitchen. The cows had helped to get it;
and the settee in the living-room, and
the books, and the wireless. She was
glad they had all those things. There
was no chance now, though, to buy more.
It took all the cow money to pay their
way.
Twelve years! And nearly all that
time she had been milking cows. It was
only one at first—“ Just to have our own
milk and cream.” Then it was two —
“Just for a bit of pocket-money for you,
old girl.” And so it had gone on.
As she stitched away at the patch on
Peter’s old trousers she looked at her
hands. Twelve years ago they had been
white and soft and well kept. To the

teasing girls she had said she scarcely
knew one end of a cow from another
and she wasn’t going to learn!
A derisive smile twisted her lips. In
twelve years she had learnt a lot
about cows. Even on Sunday there
was no rest from them; just get
interested in a book and it was
time to see to the cows! Cows from
morning to night. Feed them, milk them,
bathe their cuts and see that they had
water; separate, wash the separator, get
the cream away. Then in a few hours
start all over again. And some women
even made the butter! She would never
do that, for any consideration!
She was putting the separator together
when the children came running in from
school.
“Mum, mum, where are you?” Petey’s
voice was excited. “Mum, dad’s bought
anew cow from Mr. Bruce for my birth-
day present. Says I’m to milk it, and I
can have all its calves for my own!”
So, she thought as she sat down
wearily on the dairy table, Peter had
remembered both his birthday and his
present! “I hope she’s not hard to milk,”
she added aloud.
“No, Mr. Bruce says you’ve only got
to touch her. Where’s a bucket, mum, so
I can start now?”
Silently she handed him a bucket, and
he dashed off. Molly was asking in an
aggrieved little voice: “Can’t I milk, too,
Mum? I hope dad gives rpe a cow for
my birthday.”
Hot words sprang to Mary’s lips, but
she forced them back.
“P’raps he’ll give you a calf, Molly.
No, you can’t milk now, dear; wait until
you’re a big girl. Take Billy inside and
give him a cake —they’re in the big tin
under the safe.” Picking up her bucket
she went out to the evening’s milking.
Petey’s face was flushed with pride and
endeavor, and she guessed his arms were
aching; but she finished her first cow
before she offered help.
“I’ll finish her off, son, while you bail
Baldy for me.”
“Oh, no, mum, it’s all right. I’ve nearly
done.”
“I think you’d better let me, old man.
You know if she’s not dried off properly
she’ll go dry.”
“Right-oh.” And the ten-year-old
milkman rose a bit stiffly from his stool
and handed over the bucket. As she took
her seat she heard Peter’s voice.
“Now, that’s not in the bargain, Petey,
my son. I said you were to milk the
cow yourself. I didn’t get an extra cow
for your mother to milk.”
Petey explained eagerly, Mary didn’t
speak; she was watching Petey’s little milk-
stiffened fingers fumbling the leg-rope.
She kept her back to Peter as she went
to Baldy’s side. Presently he walked
away, carrying the two full buckets of
milk with him —an unusual attention....
Petey was nearly fourteen, and they
were milking fifteen cows, when he heard
his father say he thought Molly ought
to give a hand with the milking. He was
surprised to hear his mother reply in a
hard voice, “Are you thinking of giving
her a birthday present, too? You leave
Molly alone. She does her share.”
She did not add that Molly was show-
ing aptitude for drawing, and she wasn’t
going to have the child’s slim fingers
lose their cunning. Peter did not pursue
the subject, but went away to his plough-
ing, wishing that prices would rise, so
that a man could get something for his
wheat.
At the New Year Petey was to go to
town to high school. Not the college
Mary had planned, but all they could
afford.
Petey was worried about the cows.
How would his mother manage?
“Perhaps,” he said, “young Billy could
milk one, mum.” Mary noticed that he
didn’t mention Molly. “Old Darkie’s
pretty easy.”
“Yes,” she agreed, “he’s nine now.
We may have to let him milk one.”
“I wish you could get rid of the cows,
mum ; it would be much easier for you.”
“P’raps we will some day, Petey. But
don’t you worry about me. I’ll be all
right, and proud as Punch at my boy
making a name for himself at a town
school.”
Petey’s grin was thoughtful. He was
still worried. “You see, mum,” and he
lifted his head from the cow’s side to see
how his mother would receive his next
words, “I’m afraid I’m going to be away
a long time.”
Mary milked on as usual —a year with-
out him would be an age.
“There doesn’t seem to be much in
farming. I’d like to go in for flying.”
There! It was out, and his mother was
still milking. He leant thankfully back
against Jersey, and didn’t see that milk
went on Mary’s dress, on her shoes, and
outside the bucket as her hands faltered.
“Flying, Petey?” she queried. “Do
you think you’d like that?”
“Rather! I’ve been thinking about
it ever since I had that fly two years
ago.”
“But that was only for five minutes.”
“I know, mum, but as- soon as we
landed I said to myself, ‘That’s what
I’m going to do some day—be a pilot! ’ ”
“But, Petey, you want to be sure.” Her
heart was crying out, “It’s dangerous!
He’ll go away—perhaps to England!”
“I’m sure, mum. Quite.”
“You’re a bit young to decide, Petey.”
“Well, mum, Molly’s two years younger
than me, but you seem to think she knows
what she’s talking about when she says
she’s going to be an artist.”
The justice of that struck Mary as she
leaned still harder against the cow’s flank.
Old Brownie turned patient eyes to see
what was happening to her mistress.
“You’re right, son. If Molly’s old
enough to know, so are you, and I want
you to do what you like best if it’s pos-
sible. I don’t like square pegs in round
holes.” Mary Smiley walked with a firm
tread to the gate of the cowyard and
emptied her bucket into the half-full one
standing there.
“Gee! Mum’s a trump,” muttered
Petey against Jersey’s flank. Aloud he
said, “I’m afraid it might cost a lot of
money, mum. Do you think I could sell
my calves?”
“Of course,” agreed Mary. “We’ll
manage the money somehow.”
As she picked up her bucket to follow
Petey from the cowyard she turned and
looked at it, at the cows feeding, the
leg-ropes dangling, the stools against the
wall. She thought how much of her
life had passed in that cowyard, sitting
on those stools, leaning against those
cows. A surge of hatred welled up in
her as she turned and followed Petey to
the dairy
Petey had gone away to school. They
had seen him olf that morning, smiling
and keen for the new adventure. Molly
and Billy had gone to bed, and Peter and
Mary were sitting on the back verandah
for a breather before following them.
“What’s this idea of Petey’s about
being a flyer?” asked Peter. “He’s got
some bee in his bonnet.”
“Perhaps he’ll grow out of it,” soothed
Mary, though there was no hope in her
tone. “He’s young yet.”
“H’m!” grunted Peter. “He’ll jolly
well have to. We’ve got no money for
fancy jobs like that. Looks like another
warm day to-morrow, old girl.”
“Yes,” agreed Mary. And then, after
a pause: “Peter, I think you’d better buy
that cow Tom Bruce was telling you
about. He says she’s a good butter cow,
and I think I’ll make the butter this
year.”
“Eh?” almost shouted Peter. “Make
the butter?”
“Yes,” said Mary as she walked inside.
“They’re giving ninepence a pound for
it now.”
The Port Unknown.
Weary leagues and leagues behind,
Weary leagues and leagues before,
We, who fought the tide and wind,
Fight no more.
Noons and noons and noons agone,
Quitting channels mapped and marked,
Foolish was the quest whereon
We embarked.
Blind to all and hearing nought,
Spurning law or lore to heed,
Where no keel had ploughed we sought
Safe to speed.
Caring not what winds might rage,
Nor what fate might be our lot,
Ancient stars for pilotage
Sought we not.
Questing for the Port Unknown —•
Eyes ashine and souls unquailed—
Through waste waters, lost and lone,
On we sailed.
Where the winds might drive by night
Or the tides by day might draw,
Coastal light or beacon white
Ne’er we saw.
How we sought with heart and hope—•
Voyaged vainly on that quest —
Tattered sail and ravelled rope
Now attest.
Waves ahead and wake astern,
Foam a-seethe beneath our bow,
’Tis too late for us to turn
Homeward now.
Weary leagues and leagues behind,
Weary leagues and leagues before,
We, who fought the tide and wind.
Fight no more.
Chartless on a lonesome sea—
Thus made frustrate, beaten thus —
Mariners, we pray ye be
Warned by us.

WORMS
A COMMON COMPLAINT WITH
CHILDREN—HOW TO TREAT IT.
Worms, by their movements and the
interruption they offer to the contents
of the Bowels, generally occasion pain
or uneasiness in the Abdomen, some-
times spasmodic, sometimes gnawing and
biting, and not infrequently of a vague,
indescribable character, and yet very dis-
tressing. Sympathetic with this is a sen-
sation of itching at the nostrils, producing
a disposition to pick the Nose, which is
characteristic of the affection. The
Bowels are often disordered, sometimes
relaxed, as in Dysentery. The appetite
is exceedingly variable ; in- some cases
natural, in others deficient, craving or
depraved, one condition not infrequently
alternating with another. The Abdomen
is often hard, swollen and tympanetic,
the breath heavy or foetid, and tongue
furred, with disagreeable taste, and a
copious flow of saliva ; swelling of the
upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils and
disposition to grind the teeth during the
sleep are other characteristic symptoms.
The effects, however, often extend be-
yond the Alimentary Canal, and various
derangements of health are experienced
in consequence, either of the direct irri-
tation of the worms or of the disordered
digestion which they occasion. Among
the most common of these are nervous
affections such as fretfulness, irritation of
temper, wakefulness or disposition to
excessive sleep, disturbed sleep, sudden
starting out of sleep, as if from fright,
dizziness, spasmodic movements of the
eyelids, temporary blindness and deaf-
ness. General convulsions are not infre-
quent in children also.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to
recognise the fact that their little ones
are suffering intense pain and distress,
and are practically irresponsible for the
outbursts of temper, restlessness and
; peevishness, and until some more serious
; symptoms appear nothing is done to
alleviate the distress. The symptoms of
this disease are somewhat variable, but
generally they are so characteristic that
no mother need have any doubts. The
best proof of worms is worms, and if
the general conduct of the child is such
as to give, the slightest suspicion a care-
ful watch will afford ample proof. .
A child who is affected with Thread
Worms will often appear to the eye to be
in an indifferent state of health. It
becomes peevish and irritable in its
temper. Another point to which the
attention of mothers should be specially
directed is that the child is apt to start
in its sleep, its repose being in the way
of a disturbed nature.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal pre-
paration, compounded on a scientific
principle for the eradication of worms
which infest the Intestines. They contain
specific properties which destroy the
worms but cause no injury to the
Stomach or Bowels, and do not weaken
the system. The pellets are prepared in
the form of a confection or lolly, have
no disagreeable taste or smell, but, on the
contrary, inspire children to take them
as they would an ordinary sweet.
