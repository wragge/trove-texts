SATURDAY, APRIL 26. 1884.
The cloture is a detestable expedient. Its
influence for good and useful purposes is
altogether inadequate to compensate for
for the opportunities it affords to the
euemies of popular liberties. Those are no
true friends of free Parliamentary institu-
tions who resort to the cloture as a means of
venting personal antipathies or party dis-
like. Parliamentary proceedings have been
conducted successfully enough until the last
few years without operation of the “gag.”
Possibly the freedom from obstruction has
been in part due to the fact that until
recently there prevailed in the British House
of Commons forms of pressure and restraint
quite equivalent to those recently imported.
The direct influence of the Crown and the
power of the actual Government used to be
actually formidable. These powers have
waned, and it is alleged that disorder has
grown. We doubt, however, whether a
historical review would support that allega-
tion. Meanwhile the power of silencing
obstructive members has been assumed by
Parliamentary Chambers in the mother
country and in these colonies, and amajority
has been invested with a power which, to
our mind, may be so perverted as to strike
at the root of real representation, and
to throw absolute and tyrannical power
into the hands of an unscrupulous and over-
bearing faction. There is, however, one
enemy to free legislative functions, almost
equally culpable with the wielders of the
cloture, and that is the man who so abuses
his rights as to make the introduction of the
gag pleasing to the community, and thus
lead to an insidious growth of the practice
of repression. If the terms and the tone of
the 8.M. Herald’s report of the proceedings
and deportment of Mr. A. G. Taylor be
accepted without reserve, the senior member
for Mudgee would certainly appear to have
done his country the deep wrong of abso-
lutely inviting the introduction of the
deplorable procedure referred to. It may
be that the hon. gentleman did so comport
himself, but that he did so with a design to
which his subsequent proceedings seem to
point—the design of testing the power of
the Assembly to silence, even temporarily,
one of the elect of the people—then, instead,
of hastily judging, it will be well to respice
finem —to look to the end. In any case,
however, present material for forming an
opinion as to the merits of the conflict
between Mr. Taylor and the majority is
insufficient. There is animus sticking out of
the Herald’s report. It is stated therein that
Mr. Tatlob “read some irrelevant matter
from a printed report with reference to the
Permanent Artillery.” The “irrelevance”
of the matter is a matter of opinion. Mr.
Tatlob would doubtless traverse the
Herald’s view, and declare that the matter
was not irrelevant. And considering that
the subject before the Committee was a vote
for the staff of the Permanent and Volun-
teer Forces, it would seemingly have needed
some ingenuity on Mr. Tatlob’s part to find
irrelevant matter in a printed report having
reference to the Permanent Force. In fact,
it is difficult to know whether Mr. Tatlob
badgered and obstructed the majority, or
whether the majority badgered and ob-
structed Mr. Tatlob into the condition of
downright mutiny against the chairman,
the majority, and the Speaker, to which he
seems to have wrought himself, or to have
been wrought.
• * •
Admitting that Mr. Tatlob was indiscreet
and unmanageable, the essence of his ob-
struction seemed to have a flavour of genu-
ineness. His lengthy indictment against
the Ministerial military policy, tb® pertinent
query—“What return do we get for our
expenditure?” should not have been met
from the Treasury benches by a mere “ Shut
up! or we’ll gag you.” What return do we
get for our large military expenditure?
Surely a most pertinent question — and
one not to be blandly answered by
references to what a Royal Commission
thought a year or so ago, or to the honied
words of “ distinguished ” visitors at a mess
luncheon. It doesn’t require much military
experience to understand that Easter en-
campments, such as were held this year, can-
not possibly have been of any real educa-
tional value—i.c., in the way in which they
are at present conducted. If the troops
were volunteers, it would be ungenerous,
perhaps, to grudge them an Easter picnic,
and to debar their officers from doing the
grand in their show tents. But since the
troops are very handsomely paid, it becomes
of the first importance, if the country is to
get value for its money, that the annual en-
campment should have appreciable training
value, and that the work done at it should
be thoroughly done under the closest super-
vision of competent judges, the deficiencies
being scrupulously pointed out, not cap-
tiously, but in a kindly suggestive manner*
Instead of criticism, meaningless “melted
butter” is ladled out in Brigade orders.
After an encampment, at which a consider-
able number of very serious blunders were
made, the pionicers, before being dismissed,
are gushingly informed that they are per-
fection-information that, to the majority
of the men who are really anxious to learn
their duty, is an insult because a lie. An
exhaustive critical report on the operations
performed would be of more value than a
flattering false Brigade order, and would be
far more appreciated by the better stamp of
soldier.
No doubt it must have been tremendously
provoking to the War Minister, fresh from
the mess luncheon at which Commissary-
General Strickland and Colonel LEGGEhad,
declared that the New South Wales Defence
Force was the grandest body of colonial
troops they had ever seen, and Colonel
Richabdlon had modestly accepted the
outrageous compliment as one that his
troops actually deserved, to hear Mr.
Tatlob from his place in the Assembly
denouncing the force, in language the exact
converse of that which had been employed
by Messieurs. Richardson, Strickland and
Legge. Mr. Stuart seems to have felt that
he had a right to be angry, and acting upon
that feeling waxed very angry indeed. Tet
neither his anger nor his fatuous trust in
the postprandial deliverances of the dis-
tinguished visitors at the military banquet

There’s a story going the rounds of the
papers just now touching a piece of smart work
on the part of the police in Nevada, and in all
probability the tale is a lie, or it wouldn’t be
caught on to quite so readily; but the following
tells of a still smarter job and has the merit of be-
ing perfectly true as well. The story is that on a
certain day in 1863, a highway robbery was com-
mitted across the border at 6 a.m.; the robbers
were captured, and, as the Court happened to be
then sitting, they were tried at 9 a.m. and sent-
enced to two years’ imprisonment. At 1 p.m, thev
wore lodged in the Beechworth gaol; at 3 p.m.
they escaped, and at 6 p.m. they carefully stuck-
up the gold escort in the most tradesman-like
manner possible. Eight there, however, the
smartness ended, but it is satisfactory, (to a certain
extent) to know that the police firmly believe to
this day that thev have a clue as to the where-
abouts of the robbers.
“Lend’s your umbrella am innit, old ’un,”
said Jones, as he rushed in during the wet spell on
Oup Day. We laid our gold-tipt pen on the walnut
table, put our gold-runmed glasses up, and, looking
at Jones, asked if he would stay and sign a mort-
gage. Sign a mortgage I Why, l only wanted
We still looked at Jones, as he moved to-
wards our portable property, and gently removing
it beyond his reach, we observed, •• You only want
to run across the street. Yes, we know. Young
l that ’ l 8 what they all say. Man warns but
little here below, but when he wants his umbrella
he wants it. Our umbrella is not an article of
great value ; it is gingham, and it is green, but
when the rains descend and the winds blow we
want it up on deck all the time. We have known
people who have listened to the song of the siren
who came to borrow umbrellas, until they have
been transformed into a people without an um-
tu;elia between them and the storms of heaven,
were not that kind of green sapling. Will you
sign a mortgage ?” Jones drew back his eager
hand, and walked across our velvet pile carpet
and down our marble steps into the inclement
outwardness.
can alter the simple fact that the encamp-
ment was, from a scientific standpoint, a
failure, a failure so considerable, so palpaple
to all save those who would not see, as to
have afforded Mr. A. G . Taylor a thoroughly
good excuse if not a complete justification
for his hammering away with what Mr.
Cameron thought such damnable iteration
at the monstrous extravagence of a great
annual expenditure to maintain a consider-
able force in a state of inefficiency.
• • *
Mr. Stuart, as War Minister, dwells with
great complacency on the fact that “ great
authorities” have approved of our system
■of local defence. The most reliable of those
authorities have merely endorsed the theory
of our defence system as jotted down on
paper. Now, on paper, the theory doesn’t
read so badly. For instance, we have in
theory a Permanent Artillery Force, resem-
bling on paper an equal force of British
Artillery. British Artillery, however, is
officered by men who are professional ex-
perts—men who must have graduated at
Woolwich with credit; while our Artillery
Force is mainly officered by men who
can’t pass the “ littlest ” of “ little-goes.”
This one difference in quality of officers
between the New South Wales and the
Imperial artillery is a most material one.
Were the local artillery really well officered,
each commissioned gunner being a thorough
expert, it would be what it appears to be on
paper, the nucleus of a formidable defence
force. As it is, it cannot maintain its own
prestige, much less serve as an exemplar to
militia bodies. Again, on paper, we have a
paid militia. Great authorities reading this
statement (in connection with that about
our having a Permanent Artillery Force)
might reasonably say “GoodI” naturally
thinking that we got good work—our
money’s worth—out of our paid militia. Yet
they might, perchance, substitute another
word for “good,” were they to learn that
just as our Artillery Force is weak
through lack of expert officers, our paid
militia never get any proper training, the
annual encampment being allowed to
degenerate into a mere jollification outing.
• • •
Where would our defence force be if an
enemy landed? To ask this question, it is
urged by not a few fools, is to disparage the
Valour of our troops. The question, in
reality, is not one about valour, but about
efficiency. We suppose that, man for man,
the men of New South Wales are as brave
as those of any other country. We leave it
to idiotic Podsnaps to suppose that they are
braver. The point is, are our paid troops as
professionally expert as those which might
be landed here with hostile intentions, were
the Empire to be engaged in war with any of
the Great Powers ? It doesn’t need a great au-
thority to say “No” to that query. O ur troops
fire neither one thing nor the other, neither
trained volunteers, nor thoroughly well-
officered regulars. Hence, to rely upon it is
to rely upon a broken reed, without any
disparagement of its members’ individual
pluck.
• * *
We certainly cannot see how members of
the Assembly, who profess to be Liberals,
can consistently endorse the votes for the
military establishment, seeing that, small as
it yet is, numerically, it embodies all the
worst faults of the British aristocratic
military system, without any of the
latter’s excellences. There is still a good
deal of jobbery in the British service,
but of late years there has been as a rule an
anxiety shown at the War Office (if not at the
Horse Guards) to secure competent officers
when any business of particular emergency
is on hand. In the management of the
New South Wales Defence Force successive
have jobbed, even more than
their English prototypes, without having dis-
played the least desire to secure competent
or to dismiss incompetent officers. Worse,
even, than this, when in the discussion of
the Estimates the military votes are called
On—when, in a word, the proper time has
arrived to contest the military policy that
is saddled on the country, the Government
shut up the impugner of it, not by answer-
ing nor even attempting to answer the matter
of his criticism, but by taking exception to
his manner of presenting it. Mr. Taylor
pressed his indictment in bad form
and at too great length, but it was
a true bill, and by the temper displayed by
the Ministerial majority it is pretty clear
that what “fetched ” Mr. Stuart and made
him so anxious to carry on his “naming”
process a step further, was not so much Mr.
Taylor’s tactics of obstruction as the essen-
tial truth of his remarks. Of one thing
however, the War Minister may rest assured’
and that is though he may have “ shut up ”
Mr. Taylor for a week, he has not clotured
public opinion, not stayed for a single hour
the process of intrinsic dissolution which is
at work in the body of our rotten defence
System.

Sweeps and Lotteries.
OtfLif the other day, the promoter of a racing
sweep, advertised as a consultation, waslprosecuted
in accordance with the spirit of the laws which
pondemn and treat as misdemeanours all enter-
prizes which tend to foster the gambling spirit.
A racing sweep is a lottery, and lotteries are
illegal. But.'Art Unions are not illegal, ana, conse-
quently, the most pure-minded and high-principled
legislators, while debarred by their elevated char-
acter and by the sense of the onerous duties they
hold from countenancing in any way lotteries, may,
without detracting from the estimation in which
they are held, advance the cause of art culture by
promoting distributions of objects of vertu, the
creations of genius. Such is the case, no doubt, in
connection with the Distribution of Australian
Freehold Property, conducted under the auspices
—we quote the advertisement—“ of the following
members of Parliament:—H. Taylor, Esq., M.P.,
S. Smith, Esq., M.P., J. Sutherland, Esq., M.P.»
W. Proctor, Esq., M.P., W. Targett, Esq., M.P.,
8. Bcrdkkin, Esq., M.P., W. Teech, A. G. Taylor.
Esq., M.P., M. Chapman, Esq., M.P., John See.
Esq., M.P., Harry Levxen, Esq., M.P.; and with
the ex-8peaker of the Legislative Assembly
as legal adviser. Under the auspices of these
gentlemen, it is announced that £15,000 worth of
property will be “ given away,” and this generosity
would no doubt be worthy of and would obtain
“the patronage” (we quote again) “alikeof the
merchant prince or of the humble labourer ” were
it not that the trifling condition is appended that
each patron shall pay £1 for the privilege of
patronising. The objects of art “ comprise a large
number of villa residences, and also of those noble
creations of the artist’s genius, “ blocks of land.”
But enough of raillery I This thing is an
impudent rascality. It is a lottery of the most
flagrant kind, perpetrated by, or under the aus-
pices of, men whose position requires of them that
they should be the last to dodge the spirit, and, in
tact, treat with contempt the very letter of the
laws which it is their function to make and their
duty to uphold. Had Tom, Dick, or Harry, plain
men without parliamentary influence or connec-
tions, attempted to raffle their “blocksof land”
thus, they would have been prosecuted, beyond
a doubt. If the Atttorney-General has given
his sanction to this thing, he has prostituted
his office. If a block of land and a villa be legiti-
mate objects for distribution under “ art union,”
so is a station with a comfortable residence and
valuable improvements, or a well found, and
copper-fastened brig, or a coal mine, or, in fact
anything whatever, except cash. If this thing be
permitted to be accomplished, it will be necessary
to conclude that in future the right to get
up lotteries is to be a patent privilege secured
to legislators and their friends, as against the
vulgar common people. We have yet, thank
heavens, upright and patriotic members of Par-
liament to denounce and check such monstrous
pretensions. We have the choice of the Demo-
cratic Alliance—the poor man’s friend, Mr. Burde-
kin. We have the active and scrutinizing A. G.
Taylor, ho whoso voice is never still from ex-
posing wrongs. We have “ honest ” John Suther-
land; we have but, Good Heavens! all these

And, just here, so that we shall not lap
ourselves in the soft notion that we have
got beyond all that, is a clipping fron
the London correspondent of the D. T. It
refers to the famous picture of the “Roll Call ” by
Miss Thomson. After the Prince of Wales
laudation, the crowd at the Royal Academy be-
came so great that the picture had to be railed in.
After what wo have done with Roseberys &o«,
we are humble enough to believe this, and keep
very quiet. After all, it seems that the idea of a
king being the father of his people and half divine
is not by any means extinct. We have long ago
lost the notion that to bo a king is to be some sort
of hero ; but we are evidently not yet clear that a
man who is born in a palace has not some sort of
“ divinity ” hedge ” him in matters of know-
ledge. How else can wo account for it that
a man upon whom we cannot impose in selling
a basket of fish, and who can give a javelin
thrust through and through a lot of old dogmas
that our fathers thought solid rook, can yet go
down, Tartar fashion, on all fours, and crawl up
to a throne licking the dust all the way ? It is an
insult to modern manhood to see these lick-spittle
gentry crawling, and did wo not know, from ex.
amples, in re bishops and titled nobodics nearer
home, that this ridiculous cringing is still all too
universal, we should ascribe it to a bitter and con-
temptuous cynicism. But it is not that. There is
a class of people who will crawl and cringe before
power or wealth simply because it is power
and wealth. And the humiliating thing about
it is that this crawling is not eonllned to
the Ignorant, but is followed by people who
know, or ought to know, that a prince is n«
more than a wealthy young gentleman, born
In better circumstances than we are, by chance
and our own convenience representing our nation,
and by choice and free will worthy or not worthy

a judge of art, or of coach-building’, or anything
else, and to snigger when he smiles, and weep and
pray when he gets a fever or sprains his ankle, is

The Sydney Morning Herald says:—“Obvi-
ously it will be most absurd to say that no aliena-
tion of the foreshores of Port Jackson hould take
place.” It seems to us that the boot is on the
other leg, the obvious absurdity being the enunci-
ation of so conservative a proposition. Not an
inch of foreshore should ever have been alienated
For legitimate bona fide trade purposes certain
foreshores might be leased under reasonable con-
ditions, but the State should make its face flint
against the present practice of private persons
running the fences of their private estates down
to the water’s edge, thereby preventing a suitable
breadth of the foreshores being one continuous
public reserve. As to those cases where private
fences have been run down to the water’s edge
without such an authority as an alienation of a
portion of the foreshore confers, the law should
be set in motion against the offenders without
scruple or hesitation.

Mr. Thomas Garrett maintains (not that he is
an authority! that if the Legislative Assembly
raise the salary of their Speaker, they must also
assent to the raising of the salary of the President
of the Legislative Council, since they must regard
the two positions as being equal with each other.
This allegment that it is necessary to regard the
two positions as equal is sheer “rot.” The two
positions are not equal. The Speaker of the
Assembly has at least three times as much work
to do as the President of the Legislative Council;
and, besides, his (work is of a far more arduous
character, entailing |a far greater strain both on
the physical and Intellectual capacities. A real
smart man ought to preside in the .Representative
Chamber, whereas any old woman, who is not an
absolute idiot, is equal to the task of filling
the chair of our “ Lords.” As for the comparative
dignity of the two billets, nsthing need be said
about that, since dignitylis an article there’s no
necessity to pay for. What the State is willing to
pay for is capable work; and, of two officials, the
one who does the more work should get the more
pay. It should be remembered (not that we attach
peculiar importance to British precedents) that to
the most dignified position in the English Cabinet,
the office of Lord Chancellor excepted, viz., that
of Lord President of the Council, the lowest
ministerial salary is attached, for the reason that
the post is almost a sinecure. As for the difference
between the “screws” of the Speaker of the
English Commons (£5000), and the Speaker of the
Lords (£10,000) it is to be noted that the last-named
official is Lord Chancellor, with important legal
functions to discharge over and above the duties
of his speakership.
Whether the tram - conductor, Martin, was
dealing with his own property, or acting as jackall
for his superintendent in raffling diamond studs
among his feilows, he was guilty of a gross error
of judgment. He should not have “gone alone.”
Considering that he secured 73 subscribers at haif-
a-sovereign each, for studs which cost £li, there
was an ample margin to work on. Ho should have
dubbed his little speculation a “grand distribu.
tlon” ora "Tontine;” he should have announced
that the studs would be given away, and he
should have secured a number of members
of Parliament as a “committee.” In this
way his margin of profit might have been
reduced, but he should have found no difficulty in
having the consent of the Attorney-General pro-
cured to his enterprise as an Art Union, and, in
iieu of being liable to a prosecution, he would
have been able to figure in excellent company as
an encourager of the Fine Arts. It is only a differ-
ence of name, truly. The lottery and the plunder
would have been quite as real, but it is distinctly
something to be associated with patriot members
of Parliament and prominent patrons of the Young
Men’s Christian Association, under the sanction ol
the authorities, instead of being liable to prosecu-
tion.

parson:—“ Given a man with moderate Intellect, a
moral standard not higher than the average, some
rhetorical affluence and great glibness of speech,
Avhat is the career in which, Avithout the aid of
birth or money, he may most easily obtain power
j and reputation in English society ? Where is that !
■ Goshen of mediocrity in Avhich a smattering of
science and learning Avill pass for profound instruc-
tions, Avhere platitudes will be accepted as wisdom,
bigoted narrowness as holy zeal, unctuous egoism
as God-given pietv ? Let such a man become an
Evangelical preacher. . . . Lot him fish for
souls, not with the bait of inconvenient singular-
ity, but with the drag-net of comfortable con-
formity. Let him be hard and literal in his in-
terpretation only when he wants to hurl texts at
the heads of unbelievers and adversaries, but,
when the letter of the Scriptures presses too close-
J Jy on the genteel Christianity of the nineteenth
century, let him use his spiritualising alembic and
disperse it into impalpable ether. . . The clergy
are, practically, the most irresponsible of all
talkers.”
A meeting was held the other day to take
into consideration the case ol Rice, who is under
sentence of death. Amongst others who were pre-
sent was the Venerable The Archdeacon of Cum-
berland, who, in the course of his remarks, de-
clared that he wished it to be understood that he
could not take «ny part in any action which might
be taken by the meeting, since, for many years
past, be had considered it to be his duty to keep
clear of interference with the laws in cases of that
kind. Why, then, In the name of goodness, did
the venerable party go to that meeting ? And,
only fancy a professing Minister of the Divine
Compassion considering it his duty, in such a case,
to keep clear of interference with the laws, as
though it were not rather a duty of a servant of
Christ to strive, even to the uttermost, with the
administrators of cruel statutes, if, preadventure,
tie may wrest an unfortunate from the jaws of
destruction. We have it, though—Mr. Archdeacon
is on the “Ecclesiastical Establishment” ( vide
Blue Book) for £200 a year, hence there's prudence
in his “keeping clear of Interference with the
laws in cases of that kind.” If it were to admin-
ister spiritual comfort, now, to a poor devil about
to be turned off, we don’t doubt but what the
Archdeacon would, Parson-Bedford-like, be all
there.
Bishop Barry in his Good Friday preach-
ment made the following remark “ Do we ask

not seek to answer. AVhen men have done so.
even the deep insight of a St. Augustine saved
him not from answers which sinned against the
conscience of man and against the love of God.
No. my brethren, we seek not to answer ” Now
doesn’t that remind one of the good Father in
Salnt-Evremond’s “Conversation du Mareohal
d’Hocqaincourt avec le Pere Canaye ? ” AVhen the
Marshal said he would go to the stake for religion
without knowing why, the father said “ in a tone
slightly nasal but very devout”:—“‘I don’t
know why.’ What beautiful words 1 They ought
to be Avrltten in letters of gold I That is true
religion, that is. How gracious Providence has
been to you I” Beliefs built on a “ we dare not
seek to answer” or an “I don’t know why ” make
the sceptic sing—

May be pretty, but truth bids me go without I ”

From careful calculations, it is estimated
that the revenue of the Church of England, is
nearly £10,000,000 per annum. The larger portion
of this enormous sum is manipulated by the Ec-
clesiastical and Church-rates Commission, the
offices of which are in Whitehall. This Commis-
sion pays the prelates their incomes, which range
from £15,000 a year to the Archbishop of Canter-
bury, to £2000, to the Bishop of Sodor and Man.
There are two archbishops and thirty-two bishops.
Of these, twenty-fout have seats in the House of
Lords, Then come thirty deans, who have in-
comes ranging from £3000 to £700, the average
being £1450 each. Of course, if the Church of
England were the Church of the English people,
no objection could be taken to it as an institution;
the people in that case would be simply paying for
what they wanted; but it has been found that less
than ten per cent, of the English people patronise
the State Church. The Church of England Avas
founded by the nobility, for the benefit of the
nobility, and this being so. who are the English
clergy? For the most part, the dunces of the
families of the “ swells.” In most of these families
it is the custom for one son to succeed his father;
a second to secure a snug berth in the civil service;
a third to go into the army; and the one who is
Incompetent for any lay occupation, is generally
found a fat living in the Church. This is no mere
assertion. It can be verified by anyone who is
curious enough, by comparing the names in the
books of the Peerage, nobility, and gentry, with
those in the Clergy List receiving the highest
salaries.

“ d's ” and “ g’s ” in this light-hearted par, wo may
have fought one, and the other man be wearing
the customary woolen suit of black; but it’s not
our fault. The facts are brief. Just four weeks
ago we saw it stated in an exchange that a north-
ern editor had seen a three-legged chicken. Wo
innocently remarked in our next issue that when-
ever avo heard of a northern editor seeing three-
legged chickens we knew exactly what was the
matter. We had almost forgotten these circum-
stances till two days ago, when a gaunt-looklng
man, with a terra-cotta coloured nose, and a voice
like a foghorn, called. We were out, so the religi-
ous editor saw him. He said he was the man who
had seen that three-legged chicken, and he wanted
to Avipe out the imputation cast upon his social
habits. The “ wipe ” was to include us. He ex-
plained that he was prepared to start, straight
away, on our granting him the briefest interview.
AVe were out; and we kept out. But when our
religious editor had politely bowed the three 1 }
legged chicken-seer down the marble steps, we
thought it only courteous to answer his challenge

our regret at missing you. Are you really in
earnest ? It so, this three-legged chicken business
will get you into trouble. In the name of
humanity, we hesitate to accept your challenge,
for our hands have been too often imbrued with
the blood of our fellow men. You might not be
aware, sir, that we have filled countless gllgal
holes and dry gullies with the whitening bones of
such rash chaps as you. If we fought you, we
should Insist on doing so In your native toAvn of

afflicted wife, and economy to the family in your
funeral expenses. If we fought you. next sum-
mer the withered grasses would droop o’er your
grave, and the dry leaves would drift with every
gust of the mournful breeze that sighs your sad
requiem. If we fought you, the curlews would
scream above your lonely resting place by the
dank gum swamp; and as the bereaved family sat
round their incomplete supper-table your little
Tommv would plaintively ask ; “ Mammy, why
don’t Dad come home; is he drunk again ?” No,
sir, we will not fight you, even if you paid our
expenses up to Mudgeryboo. Our humanity for-
bids the deed. But we may take this opportunity
of explaining that it was an editor in the southern
part of the colony to whose ridiculous statement,
that he saw a three-legged chicken, our article re-
ferred. We have not heard since from the gaunt
manAvith the terra-cotta coloured nose; but we
are writing our leading articles up In the top flat

earth, for many a load he has laid on thee.’ ” The
epitaph that Rowe had in bis mind was, of course,
Dr. Evans’ couplet on Vanbrugh:—
“Lieheavy on him, earth, for he
Laid many a heavy load on thee.”
But why did he misquote it ? or was the Noozb in
fault? Anyway, the correct version will suit
Rowe to a T, for of his heaviness there isn’t a

The literary nature is not always made of
porcelain. Now and then, indeed, it is hardly
human. Byron had “no genius for friendship.”
Pope was irritable and malignant. Gray was a
prig. Fielding was something worse. Burns was
a compound of “dirt and deity.” Milton had but
one friend-a gloomy Quaker with a taste for
Greek. His first wife ran away from him before
the honeymoon was over, disgusted with “ his
spare diet and hard study.” Young, with all hi*
sentiment, was a false friend and a harsh father.
Sterne only grew sentimental when betook up a
pen. Madame de Stael was a bore of the first
water. Ersklne and Coleridge were intolerable
when they got upon “Trial by Jury” or meta-
physics. Curran was quite as much of a buffoon
as a wit; and even Grattan now and then was apt
to become very much like a “ sentimental
harlequin.”

This is downright mean. Old Earl Cairns
is evidently trying to pull a poor mouth already,
and plead poverty as a fishy set-off against the
just claims of the Finney one. Anyway, the
Argonaut says: “ Earl Cairns, who is flot by any
means rich, and owes most of the wealth he poe-
sesses to the gift of his brother-in-law. Robert
M Colmont, recently deceased, can ill afford the
one hundred thousand dollars which he will cer-
tainly, by settlement or by verdict, be compelled
to pay for his son’s indefensible conduct to Miss
Fortescue.” And we say to the Argonaut, Ah,
go not on with any more similar rubbish! Many a
better man than the Earl has had to part with more
than he could well afford. By the way, the old
Earl himself, when poor and struggling in early
lite, was jilted by an heiress, and felt it keenly.
This looks as if Nemesis dealt out punishment first
Rud then let the crime follow on at its- leisure.
Earl Cairns is about as popular as the small-pox in
his native Belfast, to whose adoption as a Parlia-
mentary pet when young he chiefly owed his quick
advar cement. Since obtaining the full measure of
his ambition, he has never visited the foundation
of his fortunes, but resides whol ly at Bournemouth
and in Scotland. However, the Earl(y) bird has
got the worm this time.
The late Dr. Jenkins was a great favourite
with the employes of Callandoou station (U.), in
which property he owned a large interest. Their
appreciation and admiration of the Dr. culmi-
nated when, in persuanco of a promise, made on
the occasion of one of his yearly visits - to make to
all thoso boundary-riders and shepherds who
should have their paddocks and flocks in good
order, a handsome Christmas present — he re-
deemed his pledge In the following- eminently
satisfactory manner. Inspection day came and so
did the Dr. and a spring-cart, laden, to the excited
Imagination of tho bucolics, with all manner of
nice things. Nor were they disappointed. The
worthy Doc., remembering the sacred season of
thanksgiving and good cheer, had managed admir-
ably to provide for the wants, spiritual and tem-
poral, of his faithful and attached servants, to
each of whom he presented, accompanied by an
appropriate address, a brand new copy of the
Holy Sonptdres, together with a tin baking dish,
also perfectly new, and of the latest pattern.
Some of the happy recipients were affected almost

Tawhiao is the “ first kingly wearer of the
emblematic blue ribbon,” or so, at least, Mr. Tem-
perance Glover styled the Maori; monarch, when
he called to offer him his watery congratulations,
at Williamstown, Considering that Tawhiao still
wears a shark's tooth as a pendant to his right ear,
we can’t help thinking that the “ bit of blue ”
must be rather a heathen badge; but no matter,
it’s going to accomplish great things for the Maori
race, “who, through the example of their king,
will have a powerful claim on the sympathy and
the prayers of the whole world, and especially of
Christian England.” Now, to take the blue ribbon
and have the whole world start praying for you,
looks like very goed business, so it’s not to be
wondered at that one of Tawhlao’s chiefs, who
had hitherto been deaf to the voice of the charmer,
“knocked under*’ at this Williamstown interview,
and permitted Mr. Glover to pin the ribbon to his
coat. This visit of Mr. G.’s was rather a Provi-
dential affair, we fancy, because, later in the day,
all the dusky converts were taken to the Exhibi-
tion, where, In due course, “ a select company ad-
journed to the board room, and a cake and wine
banquet was provided.” We never, ourselves,
attended a banquet consisting solely of cake and
wine, but should imagine that it offered terrible
inducements to indulge—especially to a Maori
king, just fresh from looking at a lot of machinery
and pictures. However, such was the still power-
ful influence of Glover’s oratory, that Tawhiao
hardened his heart against the juice of the grape,
and “contented himself with a glass of lemon-
ade.” After that he attended a concert under the
dome, and (vide paper) “seemed much impressed
with Miss Howard’s rendering of * Let me dream
again.’” Poor fellow I he. too, was dreaming,
doubtless, of old times—and “fire-water.”
Dr. Segol, who was champagned from
Inverell t’other day, en route to la belle France, was
a clever, though at times rather crotchety, medico.
But he will be greatly missed in the district, for his
professional charity was boundless. Indifference
—to put it mildly—to person and dress, with some-
thing more than a mere penchant for Bukkulla
“red and white,” were failings, certainly, but
trifles light as air when weighed in the balance
with the many acts of unostentatious benevolence
to the poorer classes. For the last few years the
doctor’s eyesight has been failing, and his memory
has ceased to be retentive as of yore. Still, having
had a large and pretty lucrative practice, he
should, and doubtless has, “ pulled it in ” to an
extent sufficient to enable him to end his days in
comfort and retirement. Dr. Segol has, in common
with many others, a most inveterate hatred of
goats’ flesh, often affirming that he would sooner
starve than partake thereof. But on one occasion,
having prescribed for a poor patient’s diet “ a
tender chop of mutton,” the man’s wife anxiously
enquired whether a chop of goat would not do as
well, mutton being scarce at the time. In the
most utter disgust, old Segol shrugged up his
shoulders, and emphatically turned up his nose,
exclaiming “Pah! Goat! No, no. DamI it would
keel heem at once.” However, it was goat or
nothing; and, next day, the doctor entering the
house sniffed hungrily round the camp-oven, and
at last, as it was near dinner time, demanded to
know the contents—“ for it does smell goode.”
After making a hearty meal off the much-despised
“ nanny,” he enquired where the delicious " mon-
ton ” came from, averring that he had tasted no-
thing like it for many a day. Then it came out.
“Veil, velll” said the old doc., “and so dat is de
goat, eh? Ah, veil, it la ve-ry goode.” Then,
seizing a piece of paper, he carefully wrapped up
the remainder, remarking to the astonished hostess
“ Yes, it is ver-y goode, and 1 sail take dis home to
my vife.”
A Royal Commission was lately appointed
by the Imperial Government to inquire into the
grievances of the Scotch crofters, and pursued its
Investigations in—among other places—the Orkney
Islands. The likelihood of the inquiry eliciting
full and accurate information may be understood
by one Incident. When the Commission was sit-
ting in Kirkwall, an Orkney landlord, Major-
General Burroughs, manfully refused to undertake
that crofters on his estate who might give evidence
before the Commission would suffer no ill conse-
quences. In spite of this frank declaration, a
couple of crofters, quite as straightforward as
their landlord, gave testimony. Major-General
Burroughs thereupon promptly evicted them
without compensation from houses which they
had built at their own expense or with their
own labour. This is a very good specimen
case. General Burroughs is neither a sneak
nor a coward. He is simply what land-
lordism and irresponsible power over tenantry
make of a determined man. When we first saw
him is so long ago that we don’t remember what
he was like. He was then a guest in the house
where he is now master, and was doing some shoot-
ing on contingent lands owned by a relative. The
next time we saw him he had commenced his
military career as Ensign in the 93rd Highlanders.
He had driven out to show himself in his new
uniform, and a dapper little figure he was. At
that time Ensign Burroughs was the smallest
officer in the British army. But he was full of
pluck, as his subsequent career proved. Distin-
guished himself at Sebastopol, and notably in tho
Indian Mutiny, where he received a C.B., and, wo
think, also a V.C. He rose to the command of his
famous regiment, and ultimately succeeded to the
estate of Witness, in the Island of Rousay, as the
heir by will of a connection who had nearer
relatives who bore his own name. General Bur-
roughs can’t even claim right of descent for the
heavy hand which he presses upon his tenantry.
Charles Reade, novelist and dramatist,
died the other day. He was was born in ’14, a son
of Jack Reade of Ipsden, a jolly Oxfordshire
squire. Educated.'at home, he entered Magdalen
College, Oxon, graduated 3rd class in classics in
’85, obtained a college fellowship and after-
wards the Vinerian Fellowship. In 1843 he was
called to the bar but he never practised. His first
novels were “Christie Johnstone” and “Peg
Woffington” (1853). Then came “It’s never too
late to mend ” ( 56). “ The course of True Love ”
and “White Lies” (’57). “Cream” containing
“Jack of all Trades and “Autobiography of a
Thief” (’58). "Love me little, love me long”
(59). “The eighth commandment ”(60), “Cloister
and Hearth ” fei). “Hard cash” (63). “ Griffith
Gaunt”(’66). “Foul Play” (68), “Put yourself
in his place ” (’70). “ A Terrible Temptation ” (’71)
“A Simpleton” (’73). “The Wandering Heir”
(’75). “A hero and martyr” (’76). “A Woman
hater” (’77). Intensely egotistic and eccentric,
Reade as a novelist was terse, epigrammatic
direct, fresh, dramatic. His plots vere well-knit
stirring, possible. His power and skill in deline-
ating character were great. Several of his novels
were written with a purpose ex. gr. “ Hard Cash ” to
expose the 111-working of private lunatic asylums,
and “Never too late to mend” that of convict
Erisons, Those that had no such aim, though, are
is best. Burnand has admirably hit off Rcade’s
chief faults in that admirable skit, “A Treble
Temptation” by the great, the unique Juff, with
its appropriate finish, “ So let us end with a couplet
of one of England’s greatest writers
‘ Where is the man of truest stuff,
The best, the greatest . . It is Juff.’ ”
As a dramatist Reade also won considerable fame
He wrote “ Gold” (’50) ; “Two Loves and a Life ’•
(’54); “The Wandering Heir” (’76); “The Scuttled
Ship' (’77); and adapted Zola’s “L’Assommolr”under
the name of “ Drink.” With Tom Taylor, he wrote
‘The King's Rival” (’54); and “Masks and Faces’
(’54) ; and with Henry Petitt “Love and Money ”
Although Reade never dropped Into poetry he
may not inaptly be called the English Victor
Hugo, since, like that great Frenchman, he pos-
sessed a superb imaginative gift, and excelled in
dramatic power, analysis of character and auda-
cious effect.
it is astonishing (writes to us a correspon-
dent from Paris) what a number of Australians
one rubs against in Paris, though they hardly take

Germain, Vesinet, and St. Ouen, besides the small
meetings at Fontalnbleau. There is quite an epi-
demic of duelling just now. In most of the cases,
words being the weapons used, little harm is done;
but last week the meeting between Mons. Lepel-
letier. Editor of the Heveil, and Vlsrdot, the
well-known violinist, was much more serious. The
cause of quarrel is not known, but ‘ lovely woman’
is again suspected—be this as it may, the chosen
weapons were pistols, and the distance 35 paces,
with the right of advancing five, making the actual
distance, 15, rather uncomfortably close quarters.
The first shot resulted in a miss to each, but on tie
pistols being reloaded, Mons. Lepelletier fired tho
quicker of the two, and hit Viardot in the region
of the heart, but a rib fortunately diverted the
ball—the latter (who did not fire immediately) was
about to fire in the air, when his adversary called
upon him to aim at him, which invitation he ac-
cepted, and shot poor Lepelletier in the groin. He
is in a bad way, as the surgeons cannot extract the
ball, and it is feared he will die. In one of the late
bulletins I read a paragraph concerning Cora
Pearl. I saw her yesterday in tho street, looking,

the Baron is about to pull down her hotel in the
Avenue des Champs Elysees, and is going to build
it, stone for stone, in Germany—quite a romance.”
The Bari of Aylesford on his ranche in
Western Texas, seems to have so successfully
adapted himself to his new style of life as to have
earned the goodwill of his somewhat turbulent
neighbours, “ the cow-boys.” Every one at Big
Springs knows who “The Judge ” is (for it is as
The Judge” the Earl is known), and since he
first appeared on the Staked Plains last August, in
charge of one of Jay Gould's agents, he has man-
aged to make himself thoroughly at home. “The
Judge ” is content with a plain, unpainted frame-
house with but seven rooms in it, though the
interior, for a ranchman's, is handsomely decor-
ated. His household consists of five servants,
twenty horses, and twelve dogs; but though hia
ranche comprises 36,000 acres, the Earl has not yet
bought any cattle. His brother Daniel shares his
exile at present, and the pair spend their time in
The Butcher Shops to be Closed on Sundays!

Sfawson crawled pown the chimney, and taking
on old shot-gun out of a corner he fixed if at full
nock m the hapds of tpo dead Mr. jMaiysqn, and
Pointed the muzzle at thp door. This was done to
Srevent any feloniously mclineid persons from in-
truding on the dead man’s privacy. When, aljve,
he never cared for company, and his considerate
brother was determined he wouldn’t be troubled
in death either. The corpse did not actually say
L wished to be alone, but he looked like a man
who did, and the live Mr. Mawson is by no means
slow at taking a gentle hint- Soon after this, the
magistrate, doctor, and constable of the dis-
trict arrived for the purpose of holding an
inouiry, and the constable had just re-
moved the door fastenings and observed it was
lucky the weather was cool as the beggar inside
had been dead three days, when ho suddenly dis-
covered the corpse was propped up in bed and had
him carefully covered with a gun. Two seconds
after, that constable was fully half a mile from
the seat of war, having first taken the precaution
to capsize the coroner and doctor and dash across
their prostrate bodies. “The man’s mad, ’ said
the medico as he picked the mud off the magis-
trate’s head and sat him up on a stump. 111 go
in myself.” So he did. And he also came out
again, at a pace that beat the policeman’s record
all to pieces. Subsequently, the coroner took a
siirht. and the time he did his mile in has never
vet been equalled. In all probability the dead
Mr Mawson would have been left “on the shoot
till the day of judgment if the live Mr. Ma; son
hadn’t turned up and explained his little joke,
and introduced the magisterial company. It was
then found the corpse’s finger was so firmly fixed
round the trigger that it was with the greatest
difficulty that it could be removed. A tumbler,
and a half-emptied bottle of brandy stood beside
the bed and the brother explained their presence
by saying he drank his brother's health before
starting off to lay an information.
Jamei Campbell, the Victorian Postmaster-
General, is a wealthy young Ballarat mam and the
son of an iron merchant. He is about 35, a good
cricketer, debater, and scholar, and about the
worst-dressed man in Australia. Before he went
into politics he read up and travellei for some
years in England and on the Continent. He was
beaten two or three times in Ballarat West, be-
cause he wouldn’t be dictated to by Bateman of
the Courier, Major Smith, R. T. Vale, and the
other wire-pullers of the Berry party who con-
trolled all the electorates within fifty miles of
Ballarat. He got in last year for the Upper House,
and Mr. Service, in selecting him for his present
post, has been guided by a desire to have a young
man with plenty of go as well as plenty of steadi-
ness. He is great in Sunday-school work amongst
the Wesleyans, but, strange to say, won’t preach.
It is, indeed, a subject of anxious doubt amongst
many of the brethren who borrow money from
him whether ho was over properly and soundly
converted, or whether he Is not unde- that
subtle delusion of Satan which is ruining so
many of our souls, viz., that a good moral life
will lead.usto the happy land where congregations
ne’er break up, and where the collection box may
be filled from Chips off the kerbstone. Certain it
is, he contrives to be superintendent of the finest
Sunday-school in Australia, gets it decorated, and
fitted with vanes and flowers, and has musical
services where people who ting through their
noses are told Very firmly to shut up, and all this
with theological notions which, if written out,
would make John Wesley kick off the top of his
coffin, go down to the beaeh, plunge in and swim
round the Cape of Good Hope, steer steadily on,
crawl out at Hobson’s Bay, just shake himself, put
on a dry shirt, tramp up via Bacchus Marsh and
Gordon, rest in an abandoned shaft ou the Eureka,
ask a Chinaman when Sunday was, and what in
thunder was meant by hanging up wirts on tall
posts, and running carriages without horses, and
then crawl around to that Sunday-school as a
visitor, and lie quiet till Campbell stood up
to give out a hvmn. He would then re-
mark—" Brother Campbel., will you do me
the favour to look me in the eye and tell
me whether you believe in hell.” And Camp
bell would leave his threepenny with a brother
worshipper to bo paid into the box at the right
time, and leap through the window and down the
Bacchus Marsh road following the old man’s
tracks, plunge in a header from Sandridge pier,
and the cable men at the Cape light house would
report him off the coast still swimming strong and
bearing due north with westerly breezes, and a
mouthful of raw albatross and no measles aboard.
Just after passing the Bddyston light-house he
would a point or two so as to dodge a chop-
ping sea and avoid running his head against an
immigrant ship bringing out Sydney labourers
at the expense of the Queensland. Government.
In the meantime, Wesley, having examined the
teachers, and referred to the shocking iatltudi-
nananism of John Osborne, would pronounce the
benediction, pull out his watch, empty the sea
water out of it, pour In a drop of kerosene to
prevent rust, and start back once more to the
grave. Arrived at the spot he will have a little
tiff because the sexton isn’t quick at taking off the
stone, and jump in. Should he meet Campbell be
would turn to the question of hell, point to the
collected edition of bis works in forty volumes,
and starting to read at vol. 1, be interrupted by tbe
question or how ong he would be. John would
reply that it will be necessary, in approaching this
subject, to read through the whole forty volumes,
as he was not exactly clear about his own doctrine,
not having looked into his works for about seventy
years. But, whatever his views were in 1776, they
were quite unchanged now. He was certain, how-
ever, tha Ithere either was a hell or a hades, or
something or other, and the volumes must all be
gone through. And then Campbell would strike for
ome, with—“ Well, if I’ve got to do that, I’ll take
your word for it—there is a hell.” (It will be seen
from this that we intended to say Campbell is a
fine fellow, and have wandered slightly).—[Yes,
slightly.— Ed.]
Professor Russell, of Goulburn, died on
Thursday last, another sacrifice immolated at the
shrine of Morphia. “ Suicide in Goulburn.— \
hairdresser poisoned himself,” is, of course, the
way the Evening News puts it. Russell was
m the habit of taking the drug, and he took more
than usual, perhaps to Induce sleep—not death.
He was a nervous subject, and had been sued the
day before by the municipality for sticking his
advertisements where they had no business. And
then Mrs. Russell came home from Sydney, and
perhaps got telling him about the way Hanlau
•feathers,” and the winter things Farmer and Co.
are showing, and the state of the betting market
in reference to the Gundagal election. Anyhow,
he got out of bad, took three pills, and died. He
was a divine barber, and a professor of dentistry
and all manner of little things, and a regular Hollo-
way at advertising. Not a fence or wall for miles
around Goulburn but eloquently spoke of him. His
myrmidons permeated everywhere. ’Twas said
that no discreet matron would have her linen
abroad o’ nights, lest she should find “ Try Pro-
fessor Russell ” indelibly marked thereon by some
paste-and-poster miscreant.” It was also said that
a patrlarcnial ’possum was taken in the pass of
Tarlo, bearing the earmark “Anodyne.” The
trouble seems to have been that the “Pro-
lessor ” had next day to appear at court to answer
to a charge of making a false declaration, and
preferred to transfer the hearing to the hightest
tribunal. Professor Russell was once well-known
in Brisbane, where he had a meteoric career,
which concluded in a large stone'.building on Petiie
Terfacb. Ofto of his Bfrishane vagaries "ff®*
stick hi? Register of birth In his shop window
among st'dfited ffoap, and tooth-brushes, ana
memoranda of tcfG latent odds.- According to the
document he was sori of tf Jrtedbourne Tide-watter.
He did a great shaving and Wetting business, and
blossomed into all the splendour of a tandem team
and dog-cart, in which he used to attend the faces.
“Uncle ” Morwitch, however, “backed ’ bird with
the usual result. For many years, subsequent to
to the Professor’s retirement. Uncle Mortwitch
cut a great figure in a buggy drawn by the rattling
grey cob, which used to be leader in the Pro-
fessor’s sparkling tandem. However, for mm,
life’s fitful fever is over, so let us give
him—who loved advertising passing well—a send-
off, which we flatter ourselves will attract some
attention on the other shore, and possibly put
something on hl» plate:—
Not below the light men saw burn—
With a rose-red radienco shine—
Shah he, in the street called Auburn,
Eter nttore sell Anodyne?
Not below the Ooulburn gaslight,
Lafge With promise of eclipse,
Sflail his polished razor pass light-
L.t tfex bearded chins and lips.
Not in rdgi6ti? whbfe fftafe onions
In the markets thifit the aif,
Shall he deal with Coins atm btmions,
Who could pare beyond cowpcftt*.
No—in rea’ms above the solar,
And all that thereto belongs,
Shall he grub around the molar
With celestial forceps’ prongs.
Who may say ? Perhaps expressly
He was called to draw a tooth
That roked up the ghost of Wesley,
Or extract a corn from Ruth.
(Ruth affected eorn, you know, as
Well as we. the fact that she
Once extracted it from Boaz
With much sweet simplicity).
Who can say, if In the ghostly
World beyond all human ken,
Are the maladies that mostly
Lop away the lives of men.
If it is so—if they can there
Reach—we solemnly assure
The sad ghosts they’ve now a man there
Who can fix ’em up a cure.
If the “jerks” take Ananias,
Or the “ fantods ” Pharaoh s hosts,
Ou his drugs they can rely as
Sure to soothe their jumping ghosts.
If a bunion William Tell has,
Or a far ingrown toe-nail—
If her new divine prunellas
Pinch the llb’ral feet of Jacl;
If in combat Martin Luther
Plugs some holy Pontiff s nose
(Though up there things should run smoother
Thau down here) till claret flows;
If, on high, displays of muscle
Are as popular as here.
That the late Pro fessor Russell
Is “their Moses” seems quite clear.
If Ring Solomon wants blisters,
Or King Oophetua pills—
If Cordelia’s loving sisters
Are afflicted with the chills;
If the late John Brown still suffers
From the chafing of his kilt.
And at medicine they’re duffers,
He ll be “ in it ” to the hilt.
. If Goliath has the staggers
Yet, from David’s little blows.
If the holes the Roman daggers
Made through Caesar’s Sunday clothes
Still show blood-if poor Joe Bradv
Still feels pain from what they call
"Chokes,” or Adam’s late good lady
Yet feels bad from that old fall;
If the Ills (and they were various)
That beset him here below
Still afflict St. Januarius.
If old Edipus’ blind woo
Still holds out-if all the evils
That made Job lie down and yelp
Have him still, and the blue devils
Place him past the angel’s help;
If the gout stirs up old Pindar.
Or King Bill the Third-but he
Is by this, of course, a cinder
From all care and sorrow free;
If Diogenes is troubled
With the Murrumbidgee jumps,
Or Jack Falstaff’s bulk Is doubled,
They’ll find Russell’s system trumps.
If sad Bonnlvard’s thin wrist is
Still from Chillon's fetters black,
Or big Samson Agonistes’
Hair again grown down his back ;
If the baldness so proverbial
In St. Paul pursues him yet—
Russell’s scissors, or his herbal
Cures, will fix them all, we’ll bet.
He can lurch a fang out, while a
Soul chews “ Raven ” unaware,
He can decimate Delilah
In the way of cutting hair;
He can, in a single tussle, .
Rid each ghost of his complaints—
Oh! with joy Professor Russell
Should he welcomed by the saints.

Labouchere speaking of Lord Hampden

The Autophone!
The oriental gold-company
have been appointed Australian Agents for
this, the Climax of Musical Invention. Call and
see them.
George Street,
Just Opposite the Entrance to the Markets.
Tho Autophone is a wonderful little instrument,
which, while it weighs less then three pounds, haa
the lungs of a full-sized parlour organ, and exe-
cutes its music with absolute precision and perfect
effect.
It has twenty-two reeds, plays in three keys, and
all the parts of most difficult music.
On it a child can correctly play, without instruc-
tion, any of its music, which at present consists of
over 300 selections from Hymns, Oratorios, Operas,
Waltzes, Polkas, Marches, Popular Songs, &c. It
is best adapted to the kind of music which suits an
organ best, in which chords predominate, but also
has wonderful power in executing very lively
pieces.
It is pitched for the voice or orchestra, and haa
a little card-holder for convenience in singing.
Any orchestral Instrument, Violin, Flute, &c., can
bo played to accompany the Autophone.
It is entirely well-adapted for Country Churches,
Sunday Schools, the Family Circle, and also for
Dancing.
The AUTOPHONE is like every other good thing,
the longer you have it the better you like it; and
as new music is being published every week, it has
an endless fund of amusement in it.

vides EXQUISITE GIFTS from 5s. to £5:
Articles of dainty design and enduring: beauty*
which will give delight at the first glance, and
will last a lifetime.
ORIENTAL GOLD is the very latest discovery
of the alchemist’s laboratory. There have been
good and useful Imitations of sterling gold before
it; but all have been thrown into the shade by
this triumph of modern science. Articles oif
Oriental Gold cannot, after years of wear, bo dis-
tinguished from the costliest wares of the gold-
smith. So noble is this metal, that no tawdry
goods of old and inferior designs are manufac-
tured of it. The discoverers have not condescended
to apply it to base uses. _
THE VERY LATEST DESIGNS IN JEWELLERY
AND BIJOUTERIE
are regularly worked up in Oriental Gold simul-
taneously with their production In sterling metal,
and, placed side by side, the one article cannot he
told from the other.
THE PRICE OP ARTICLES OP ORIENTAL
GOLD IS BUT A TRIFLE
when compared with identical models of sterling
metal.
Some of the goods are mounted with the NEW
DIAMONDS, another masterpiece of the chemists
of the nineteenth century-artificial stones which
equal the noblest brilliants in fire and glitter, and
rival them In hardness.
The Artist-designers of Paris have, with cage*
appreciation, adopted Oriental Gold as worthy to
receive their happiest conceptions. The most
graceful Parisian models are impressed upon a
portion of our stock, which is replenished with
novelties by every mail.

Tile “Strategist” is stili running at tile
rtnera House. On Saturday the (as the announce-
ments call it) “ grand; spectacular, roraantic. mili-
tarv comedy-drama of ‘ Eastward-Ho will be
nresented for the first time to a discriminating
Australian public.” In the “Strategist cast a
aliirht alteration took place on Saturday night,
iVOrsav Ogden taking up Emmetts running in
Maior Howard. As Terrence (sic) O’Flam, Harry
Power still Succeeds irt shbwlng the deep insight
into Celtic human nature possessed by comic
writers. And this reminds us that Harry has pub-
lished a book of “ Leaves from the Life of an Aus-
tralian Comedian.” He is the comedian, and the
loaves—we are told, for we have not seen them—
have to do with adventures in which he was the
central figure. Ever since we were seduced into
reading the twaddle contained in the “Leaves from
our Diary in the Highlands ” we have been suspi-
cious about personal anecdotes under this heading.
When true, they are maddeningly uninteresting;
atld when piquant, they are usually stories.
• * *
And you wanttd know why Ogden shunts
Emmett ? Of course you do, and that’s just what
not going to tell you. “Pray, madam,
imagine them,” said the Italian matron when the
latter asked about the duties of a cavaliereservante.
And a good, all round Major, Ogden is—the sort of
officer that makes you regret you were not in his
company. You feel that some ramrods would go
his way when the troops were practising with
blank-cartridge. As Sergeant Grumbleton, Lester
shows what a command of our rugged language
can be acquired by an ordinarily Intelligent Ger-
man We have said so much of the Polks them-
selves and of Mr. Dryer that we can remember
nothing particular to add to what has gone before.
]n other hands the “ Strategist ” could be made as
Hggravatiugly stupid as a circus clown’s jokes; in
theirs it is laughably improbable all through.

For Saturday’s “grand spectacular drama”
many names appear which had no place in the
" Strategist ’’—among others, Jessie Grey; Ruth
Grey, Messrs. Jones, Cob, and RuSsell.

We have been to see “Passion” again, and
the piece has drawn better than we had hoped.
We are not “passionately fond ” of “Passion,” as
the Yankees say—in fact, we haven’t any passion
for it at all. But, what is better, we have com-
passion, and our compassion is the thing most
sought after by play-wrlghts and other people of
sensitive and responsive natures. And we like
Wybert Reeve—at least, we think we like him.
We have never seen him, but we must like him
because genius Is right in our line, and Wybert is
a genius-a left-handed genius, as it were. We
wish he would send us the manuscript of that
play. There is a certain spot in this office
for which it is exactly suited. And it would
have company, spring poetry, and the like, which
is a great desideratum, for misery loves company,
and “Passion” must pine for suitable compan-
ionship. We suspect that Wybert wrote the play
on hoard the steamer coming out from home. At
any rate, it is awfully sea-sick in places; in other
places it is as wild and picturesque as a Shanghai
rooster on a rioketty hen coop, calmly floating
down the peaceful stream of time.
* * *
The plot of the piece is excellent; at least
we imagine it is excellent, because Mr. Reeve has
left it clear out of ihe play. A little more plot, a
good deal less soliloquy, and a heap more crisp
dialogue is what “ Passion ” wants to rectify its
system. We don’t remember reading Mrs. Campbell
Praed’s original story from which “Passion’ has
been dramatised. We didn’t know, in tact, that
she had Praed upon the public at all. But enough
of nonsense. We’ll say something bad about Pas-
sion ” if we don’t look out. Mr. Edwin Palmer, as
Tom Dungie, has an up-bill part to play. We know
Mr Palmer’s abilities as an actor, and would like
to see him cast for a better role. The long soliloquy
In the first scene is not only hard to sustain, but it
is hard to endure. We would like to know where
Edwin got that nose. It isn’t a bit like his own.
In the matter of noses, Mr. Palmer is versatile.
A short time ago we saw him in Pantomime at
the Biiou in Melbourne, and he had a beak on him
then long enough to pick flies out of a molasses
iug Now he has a pug-nose that he must have got
to examine his liver with. At any rate, the pug Is
so awfully marked that he can t look at it without
seeing down his own throat.
• • •
Of course, Maggie Knight, as the Premier’s
daughter, appropriates the pastry. Maggie is great
on pastrv; she always gets more than her share.
But we don’t like the way she talks to the pirati-
cal-looking fiend she calls father—on the stage, we
mean In the first place, she won’t give up her
own sweetheart, and, in the next place, she
wants to rob her old father of ms. Ot
course, this is more than the old man s sys-
tem can tolerate, and he rebels against the
tyranny of bis own child. This is one of the
beauties of “Passion” that we had almost for-
gotten to point out. At last she goes back on her
first lover, throws him over the fence and takes
up with an explorer named Maddox Dyson. Dyson
(Wvbert Reeve) knows a lot about exploring a
new country, hut when it comes to making love
hi does™know half as much as the Widow Dunn.
On this (Saturday) evening Mr. Reeve intends to
bring 1 out the great London drama entitled The
Squire.” * * * *
“The Silver King” continues to be the
leading theatrical attraction. It draws, in fact,
like a poor-man’s plaster on a marble monument.
We don’t know when the managers are going to
irive us something new to write about, but we
would like to know. They do £ *
running their concern for our benefit. This is
ungrateful, and the first thing they know we
will charter a mule to do some kicking for us.
♦ * *
There are several people we like in the
“ Silver King.” We like Cripps (Mr. Leake) for
instance, and would like him still better if be
would divide the plunder with us a little more
evenly. When we were young and used to
read blood-and-thunder stories until our hair
stood on end like an inverted bramble bush,
we used to dream of pirates and lobbers
and the like, and som« way or other our
ideal cut-throat always looked like Cnpps.So
you see, he is sort of an old acquaintance, which is
one reason why we lik« him. And then he makes
us laugh, audit isn't everybody that can do that.
We like Coombe (Mr. Redwood), too. We like him
for his downright villainy. In that make-up he is
as picturesque as a French hen, and might pass for
a pirate, or the pilot of a Presbyterian meeting-
house. Of course, Harry Leston is tunny. We
don’t think he could look at himself without
laughing. Where he gets that particular brand is
a full-grown mystery. We have sampled all the
neighbouring pubs., but it don't effect us that
way; and we had an obituary to write, too, the
other day. # #
Hans Phillips is a rising young actor. If
he wasn’t, we’d take a rise out of him, Just for
fun. But we like to encourage genius. That s
one reason why we are kind to ourself. Mr.
Phillips, however, has a good deal to learn about
comedy, but we forget what it is just now. It
will come to our mind opi another occasion, per-
haps, and then we’ll call his attention to it. The
Spider (Mr. Ireland) looks as though he bad been
cut out for cool, determined knavery. His part
is a thankless one, and the audience go away
weeping because they can t see him hanged.
Tab it ha Durhen (Miss Kingsley) is a designing
female who has hurried three husbands and Is ripe
for another. She isn’t particular as to age either,
so she goes for Jaikes, the old butler (Mr. Phillip
Day), and very nearly kidnaps him before he dis-
covers, her intentions. Jaikes, of course, has better
sense than to join a procession that has ended so
disastrously to the front part of it. It looks too
milch like CoPrtin# death* Of like a joke in the
Shadow of the gallows. JaikeS’ moral back-bone
asserts itself presently, and he repels the advances
o'f the designing wido’w. Only for this it Were
“all Day with Phillip.”

The federal Minstrels cctatinrte td crowd
the Academy of Music. Carroll, the doilble-
voiced vocalist, is still warbling dp amongst the
clouds, and anon delving into the deeper regions of
song. One Would naturally suppose that ft would
hurt a voice to fall so far, but it doesn’t. The
thing is so elastic that it rebounds uninjured.
It would be a good voice to sell fish, or
to drink beer with in Chinese. We once
heard of a woman who lost an excellent
soprano voice, while trying to teach a blind
hen to crow. Perhaps this is the one that Carroll
found. May be he ate,the hen that stole it, or laid
it, or something. Beaumont Read is another
warbler. Mr. Read says that rife 1b yearly two
stone heavier that he was a year ago, and that our
suggestion that he should tie a string around hffi
neck and feed hi# face for a while, was bitter
irony. It was not so intended. We don’t believe
in irony. In fact we never iron. We mangle.

Horace Bent has got a mouth big enough
for a corn bin. He might put a ham in and pull
out the bone and still have mouth enough left for
dress occasions, In order to make it any larger
yoil would hate to Set back his ears. We like to
hear Hotace in d stump speech; He is one of the
very few peopm whd ate really Witty in that line.
The Girards are tod fating to tdlk flbotlt.
Miss Melville, too, is getting to be qfqite a Girafd.
There are some people who don’t know what a
Girard is. Neither do we; but we know what Alt.
Moynhem and Sam Keenan are. They are the two
jolliest, rollicking high-kickers that we have ever
seen. ’Tis said that diet has a good deal to do
with such matters. We knew a man over In
America who moved from the Eastern States
away out into Kansas. This was the year when
the grasshoppers were so bad. He said that as he
drove along the road he saw them sitting upon a
fence looking over at the sprouting grain, and sing-
ing “In this wheat bye-and-bye.” When he got
onto his fanche he let loose a half-dozen turkeys
he’d bfought along In a coop. These turkeys
gorged themselves with grasshoppers, and the
next morning When the than, got up he Saw his
turkey’s tofeing a sofatCh and jumping. Some erf
them had eaten so ndany glass-hoppers that they
could jump 33 feet without weights. We don t
know what the Girards have been eating, but it
must have been something like a compound of
Grasshopper sausage, India Rubber soup and flea
powder. Hisoocks has been in Melbourne all
week, but under the stage management of Mr.
Lou Braham the show runs along as though
nothing had called the genial Fred. away.

Messrs. Thomas Moser and Hector Mac-
lean have constructed a comic opera which they I
have christened “ Populaire,” and a rehearsal of
the work was given in camera at Paling s music
warehouse on Saturday afternoon last to a small
coterie, including representatives of certain
Impresarios who desired an opportunity of judging
respecting its suitableness for theatrical represen-
tation. The piece is an avowed parody on Pa-
tience *’-a burlesque on an opera bouffe, in fact,
and Mr. Moser has succeeded in constructing an
ingenious string of situations, in which the
satire, which in “Patience” is directed against
{esthetics, is diverted against the craze for
athletics. The libretto has as much merit as it is
usual to find in the language of opera bquffe, and
the generally trifling treatment is relieved by
some really felicitous verses in a sentimental
strain. The music, composed by Mr. Maclean, is
in keeping with the structure of the story. In
the main, it is light to frothiness, and full of bustle
and catchiness, but here and there movements of
real merit occur, and several of the songs are
of more than ephemeral value. The orches-
tration, although slightly crude, is, on the
whole, effective, and the ensemble produces
an effect which has every essential quality
for catching hold of popular favour. In
many of the airs, familiar recollections crop up,
but the same is true of all Sullivan s music, in his
most successful light operas; and some of Mr.
Maclean’s songs are really very graceful and
melodious, and, withal, of a catching quality,
which should ensure their being whistled as uni-
versally as Grosvenor’s airs in “Patience, or
the correspondingly popular mpreeaux la the
“Pirates.” There was a general expression of
pleased surprise at the quality of the work among
the hearers, on Saturday, and although the public
taste is an unaccountable thing, there seems no
reason why “Populaire” should not win favour,
if produced in good style.

THE DESERTER'S STORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Full Hashed the blue electric-light
Upon a face all ghastly white—
A face whose every feature bore
Some trace of anguish written o’er;
A haunted face that seemed to show
A record of dark years of woe—
The face of one whose life might tell
Of torture deep, and strange as Hell.
Beside us, in the train he sat;
His eyes, now shaded by a hat
Devised upon no earthly law—
Such hat as Hopkins loves to draw—
Now blazing out, dilate with fear,
As guard or ticket-sharp drew near.
Quick angry forms moved to and fro
At Redfern, ’noath that large light’s glow;
Excursionists came thronging there.
And time-smit virgins tore their hair:
And big bad men were heard to swear
O’er trunks and bandboxes misplaced,
And all was turbulence and haste.
A shriek—a shock—and so, at last,
Away into the night we passed;
Into the country, far and dim,
Alone, as in a cell, with him!
So fled we on, and on, and on,
Past Homebush, Granville, and anon
We felt the night winds soft and cool,
And knew the smell of Liverpool;
So startled we the solemn hush
Of many an inky league of bush,
And heeded not, but tore along
Past Picton Lakes— past Mittagong.
’Twas then the stranger—in atone
As sad as is the dying moan
That lifelong cattle-duffers give
Who have not left an hour to live—
Said: “Friend, before I tell my tale,
(You’ve doubtless travelled oft by rail)
Tell me-oh, tell me, 11 in all
Your journeyings, it did befall
'That once a railway train did start
Upon its way (be still, my heart,-
Be still—a little while be calm)
An intercepting telegram
Withheld it from Its onward course,
Until some monster of the Force
Secured some passenger, and bore
Him to a cell for evermore ?”
■We said, “ We think so—now you ask
We're sure it did; but here’s our flask,
Drink deep of this, and, by and bye,
Tell us youf tremble." No reply
He made, but raised the flask on high,
And breathed not till it was dry.
Then cried: “ Kind comrade, what you are
I know not, but your stuff’s Three Star,
And in my breast I feel its glow
Replace the chill of utter woe.
And if you havb ft wish to know
What I have been, and how I fell
On bitter ways, ray tale I’ll tell.
I’m better now—that fiery qualm
Bids me for naught to give a d—“=-nJ
Off, all disguise!—avaunt, all fear I
I am—or was, a Volunteer!
An uneventful youth was mine—
My father sold colonial wine
Upon a far-off country road,
And I Was early trained to goad
The bony steer to shift his load;
Ah! happy, happy tkres they were,
Unshaded by the wing of cafe.
With naught to do but prod and svf ear—
Would I had been content; but I
Had hope of being something high—
Of gold and glory by and bye
I dreamed: of that red coat that charms
Soft hearts; I dreamed of shining arms.
1 fled my father's shanty (which,
I may remark, has made him rich),
I sought a town, and at a pub.,
AS “Joey,” earned precarious grub;
Hut little recked I Fortune’s frown—
Eot why ? There was in that same town
The thing that I had craved for years—
A bidding Corps of Volunteers!
And ofteU in the moonlit night
I stole to gloat tipoH the sight
These heroes were, performing drl'l.
And with me stole the barman, BUI.
And when at length we both returned,
Such martial thirst within us burned,
We suffered no time to elapse.
But stole a case of Schiedam Schnapps;
And in our little room up stairs
We formed from it twelve hollow squares!
I joined ’em, and was duly rigged
In garments such as may be twigged
At any Fire Brigade display—
What frantic Joy was mine that day I
What joy that fleetly would have flown,
Could I have of this night foreknown.
OUr Captain noted from the first
My bearing showed a separate thirst
For blood—a hankering after gore
Beyond aright he had known before;
And said, in case of War, I would
Wade armpit-deep in fooman’s blood;
But little dreamed, as me he drilled.
That his would be the first I spilled.
O, glad were we, when came at length
The day that was to show our strength,
When striving with a coward foe
At Windsor, we should lay him low;
How to the railway marched we then,
A fearless line of gallant men;
How dauntlessly our swords we clanged,
And told the porters to be hanged 1
How gaily did we, in the train,
Shout many a warlike bold refrain.
With much ex-train-eous matter queer
That I refrain from quoting here.
So came the night, the awful night
That ushered in that fatal fight;
I slept, and dreamed of Gore, and saw
In dream a thousand rebels draw
Their swords to hew me limb from limb:
I woke—like choir of Seraphim
I heard the outpost rifles sound.
At last for slaughter! With a bound
I reached, and donned my uniform,
And rushed into the dreadful storm;
A roar of sound, a blare of light
Along the line from left to right,
A hideous glare on hill and glen,
A tangled horde of fighting men.
A furious struggle hand to hand,
Hoarse shouts of onslaught and command—
I plunged into the midmost fray,
And frantically blazed away.
I sought the battle’s wildest brunt,
And leaped before the advancing front;
I stood high in that deadly van
And yelled, * Observe me—I’m the man
To lead you on to death or Fame,
Come on with me, whoever’s game I
But here the Captain’s voice rang put,
And counselled me to wheel about,
And back again to camp repair
As being much more useful there.
Fool-mad, blind fool, who knew before
My speciality was Gore;
Fool —weak, vain fool, to taunt me there,
When Blood was in the very airl
I clubbed my rifle—on his head;
The swift butt fell, and he fell dead,
And I—I must admit—I fled.
“ In that fierce hour none saw the deed,
Or, seeing it, took little heed;
For men were falling there amain,
And I had reached my tent again,
And changed War’s uniform—ah, me I—
For these disguising rags you see;
And far from that sad place had flown
Before the Captain’s fate was known.
Ail day I crouched in places dark.
Lest men should see my face, and mark
Upon it Crime’s red brand of Cain,
And, after dark, hid in this train.
What hope or help is for me now
With that dire mark upon my brow ?
I know not-this alone I know.
Far from all teeming towns I’ll go:
And pass the balance of my years
In urging on reluctant steers,
And selling navvies ‘ long-sleeve beers —
That line may suit me bettor, for
I’m far too blood-thirsty for War.
Enough, though—at next station I
Get out, so now I say good-bye,
Mine was a happy lot before
I knew the woe of shedding Gore-
Mine is a blasted being hence
Wrapped in that crime’s dark consequence.
Oars was a Waltham, just before
The porter let him out the door;
Ours now in neither watch nor purse,
That stranger holds them- and our curse.


PEPPER AND SALT.
This is a true tale about a “dawg,” and it is
gravely told in the London Spectator by the
unfortunate dawg’s owner, who seems to be ex-
tremely anxious to let the whole world know that
the race of fools is not quite extinct at present.
This drivelling divine it appears had a favourite
and intelligent dawg that could read a tract, or
whisk a leg of mutton out of a butcher’s shop and
wrap himself round the feed inside of 2,20, and one
Sawbath morn he committed a “ very grevious
fault.” The nature of the fault is not stated, but
It must have been “ very grevious ” indeed as the
rector’s study smelt of Oondy’s disinfectant for a
week after. His master on returning from church
“ did not beat him, we are told, but took hold of
him and talked to him most bitterly, and severely.
He talked on and on for a long time, in the same
serious and reproachful strain, and the dog was
so deeply impressed with his own total depravity
that he refused all feed, and died in the
course of a day or two.” Wo don’t doubt
it. He died raving mad alternately foaming at
the mouth and spitting fire. At one moment he
would be bucking round the yard as if he had just
accidentally swallowed an active hedge-hog, and
the next would find him jobbing his head into a
sand bank, or filling his ears with mud, in order, as
it would seem, to deaden the fearful sounds of his
clerical master’s blood curdling reproaches. What
seemed to trouble him most, however, was the
knowledge that he had no one to blame for his
“ total depravity ” but himself, and it is said that,
at times, certain people fancied his demented
howling sounded like the words “ It was all
through the oussld drink.” He finally died the
most agonising of all deaths-talked to death by a
parson. How many thousands of the human race
annuaUp with the same tenrtUfe fate ?
Six persons have been trampled to death
whilst attempting to escape from a church in
London. The exact reason of the stampede is
not known, but it is supposed the congregation
were afraid' of being preached to death by a wild
curate. This reminds us that wo have just had
the pleasure of inspecting a new style of pulpit,
which has been invented by an ingenious cuss in
this city, to fill a long-felt want. This pulpit is of
the ordinary kind, with the exception that its
interior is full of clockwork vllry, and at the
right-hand side there stands i colossal figure of
St. Peter, armed with a 14-lb. club. The machinery
is so arranged that a preacher can safely stand in
the pulpit and howl for 20 minutes, but directly
the time is up the floor gives a gentle buck
and St. Peter slews round, spits on his
hands, and takes a fresh grip of his wea-
pon. That’s the signal for the aspiring Spur-
geon in the box to “ get,” and to get deuced
quickly, too. If he doesn’t shift, but goes on with
his chat, the floor suddenly gives another mighty
throb that sends Spurgeon up in the air like a lawn
tennis ball, and just as ho drops, Peter swings his
club and knocks him clean over the choir-loft
fence for 5. Dr. Barry should order a few thou-
sand of these useful articles, because he has an
earnest desire to reform the preaching in his
churches, and we are willing to stake our immor-
tal soul that this new back action side-delivery
pulpit wiU either do that, or it will club the
preacher so flat that you can pass his body under-
neath a closed door without disarranging one of
his waistcoat buttons. As a slogger, this pulpit
Peter, could bust Sullivan up into lodging-house
hash in one round.

He was, or rather is, a police magistrate;
to his inferiors an arbitrary tyrant, to his superiors
a fawning sycophant. Sometime ago, he had
an addition made to bis residence. In due course
it was finished, but lacked a couple of coats of
paint. “ Oh, my good fellow,” remarked the P.M.
to his carpenter, “you may as well—ah—procure
the necessary paint, and—ah—finish it yourself. Of
course you can—ah—include it in your account at
settling.” Four months elapsed, and that white-
lead, turps, and oil were still in the limbo of bad
debts, when the same mechanic appeared before
his Worship summoned for the amount of £312s.
6d. (the exact money owing by the P.M., bar 6d)
Well, the man couldn’t pay, and had to take it out
in “ jug ’ —three weeks.
“ Ho was so proud, that should he meet
The twelve Apostles in the street,
He’d turn his nose up at them all.
And shove his Saviour from the wall.
He was so mean (Meanness and Pride
Still go together side by side)
That he would cringe, and creep, be civil,
And hold a stirrup for the Devil.”
“The good shepherd lays down his life for
his flock.” That, we believe, was the popular
style of shepherding 1900 years ago, but the average
shepherd of to-day wouldn’t lay down his shirt to
save the most promising member of hisfold, unless
he saw his way clear to make it a profitable specu-
lation. All of which reminds us that the “ Rev.
Dr. Hawkes, when elected Bishop of Rhode Island,
declined the appointment on account of the
meagre salary. One of his friends reminded him
of the promise made in Scripture that ‘ God would
feed the young ravens.’ ” To which this gentle
shepherd replied, as he playfully tapped his nose
with the first finger of his left hand: “ That may
be so, but I can nowhere read that God has prom-
isee to feed the young Hawkes.” The Dr. evident-
ly doesn’t bet much on his own teaching.

“Fair Play” sends along four dog-forms
covered with correspondence which tends to prove
that Ernest Morrison really did tramp across the
continent. We never said he didn’t. All we re-
marked was that we did not see him do it Thi.
we still adhere to. “Fair Play” declares “any
fool could do the same Journey if he knew how”
and he then proceeds to tell of a party named
Peter Grimes, who travelled 300 miles across a
Paroo desert, during the recent drought, when not
a blade of grass could be seen on any side. Grimes
was a month in training for the task. First of all
he reduced a quantity of rich, black soil into a
paste, after the style of Liebig’s essence 0 ?
beef so that one pound of this paste con
tamed as much nutritious land as a whole
acre of the original soil. Then he laid in
stock of cabbage, carrot, turnip, potato, lettuce
radish, pumpkin, strawberry, and water-melon
seeds, which he treated in a similar manner and
then he commenced operations by eating 81b of
his land extract every day for a fortnight- at the
| end of which time his stomach held exactly forty-
two acres of garden ground, the like of which has
never yet been equalled. Then Grimes put in
another fortnight eating his condensed seeds-
after which he drank a few gallons of water, and
started on his journey. Every seed took root and
grew in the soil he had swallowed; and, of course
ho had nothing to do then, as he tramped along the
desert waste, but whistle “ Nancy Lee ’’ and digest
fresh vegetables.

Down on your knees boys, and admit that
two and two are eight and a half, before its too
late. Says Monday’s D. T. man on the eagle wing
of alertness The late Mr. Frank Dixon, for
many years a staunch Freethinker, before dying,
confessed that he had been following the wrong
track, and died a believer in Christian faith, urging
the Rev. Mr. Preston, who visited him, to call his
friends together that they might profit by his
example,” We await a visit from the rev. Preston,
The Turf Spider.


for at our age we feel that another fifty years
must tell a tale, and we want to avoid a deathbed
repentance. But this thing is beyond joking. If
Mr. Frank Dixon, now consigned to earth, was for
many years a staunch Freethinker, and then when
the cold shades came around he found himself
altogether wrong, and In a day or two sends out
to us who still dwell “ this stranger world among ”
a word of advice and a wall of recantation, then
Mr. Frank Dixon was not a Freethinker, he was a
no-thinker, and one of the class of heedless
brawlers who believe not in their own unbelief.
A man who deliberately makes up his mind in
health that much of the current religion is worse
than baseless is not going to be waited on by
Almighty God in his last hours and set straight by
a divine whisper. This is the old Tom Palne-
Voltaire-horrible-death yarn. A belief that a
man may hold and live righteously with, will tide
him through. A sham-belief or sham-unbelief
provides a coward’s deathbed.

suddenly a few heavy drops rattled down on to the

Here’s a little romance of the road. The
release of the notorious bushranger Power, from
Pentridge, was brought about through the inter-
cession of a well-connected lady in Melbourne, who
has for years taken a great interest in the old
hoary-headed highwayman. Now for the romance.
One day during the rouse-about times when Power
ruled the road, ho bailed up a coach in the North-
Eastern District, and on finding only two ladles as
occupants, he immediately raised his hat, apologised
for his conduct, and rode off. The lady who has
now undertaken to provide Power with a home
was one of the passengers in that coach.

tired passenger was hauled out, he turned on the
guard who had rescued him and fiercely demanded,

loathsome lot of snobbishness was never exhibited

eyes wide open. Forbes speaks of Lord Euston’s
failure to obtain a divorce as “the melancholy
issue; talks of Lady Euston’s antecedents as being
deplorably bad,” as though that had anything
to do with the matter, seeing that Euston knew all

A girl named Delia Johnson, 14, has been
sent to the Shaftesbury Reformatory for two
years for some little larceny. Her mistress, Mrs.
Bryant, stated that she had frequently given tho
girl shelter, for she said she would rather sleep in
the street than return home, as her mother ill-used
her. And this appears to be true, so the poor girl,
instead of having the opening years of her woman-
hood directed by a mother’s care, must take the
plice down near the South Head, and be “re-
formed.” What “reforming” by State manage-
ment means, nobody needs be told. We should
suggest that when a child prefers to sleep in the
street rather than face “ home,” somebody older
wouldn’t be the worse for the South Head breezes.

fibres of wood, mouse hairs, pieces of butterfly
wings, skin of the larvae of insects, cotton fibres,
pieces of grass, epldermi, pollen grains, rye and
potato Hour, grains of quartz, minute pieces of
rooting tile-, with bits of iron and coal. And the
next account will probably be that tho scientific

stumps, sewing machine agents. Holloway’s pills,

For a goody-goody Holy Joey city, Bath-

sentenced to three days’ imprisonment, and the
exhibit would have been confiscated only it was
doubtful if the State could support a girl with
two mouths. The P.M. said he was surprised that
the Sydney police nad allowed such an exhibition
to pollute the metropolis. Bough on Fosbery,
that. Oh, and by the way, conceive, if you can,
the bliss in store for the man who marries the girl
with two heads. Especially when he comes home
with a saveloy in one hand and his boots in the

Wesleyan Parson Hughes wouldn’t attend
the banquet recently given by the Kiama men to
the travelled Dymock, because (to use his own
words), “ I look upon * toasting,’ which appears to
be inseparable from banquets as now conducted,
as, In itself, a time-honoured folly ; and because I
consider that the use of strong drink in connection
therewith is, generally speaking, fully overlapped
with dissipation, if not with drunkenness and
other offences.” The reverend one is to a certain
extent right, though he hardly draws sufficient dis-
tinction between the hughes and abhughes (cicl!
E.B.) of toasting. One or two toasts at a banquet
may be made the means of imparting information
in a genial pleasant fashion; whereas nine
or tea are to all a certain nuisance, and to
many a very possible temptation. When a
fellow has toasted (with ne’er a heeltap)
the Queen, the Prince of Wales, etc., the Gover-
nor, Our Guest, the Parliament, the Ministry, the
Visitors, the Agricultural Interests, the Pastoral
Interests, the Commercial Interests, the Ladies,
the Press, the Chairman, the Vice-chairman and
the Caterer, he s had more than is good for him ;
for it is not given to every man to go through a
big lot of toasts (as did tho Rev. J. Wilson at the
Dymock banquet) and then be able to declare (as
Wfison did) “I am temperate still.” Wilson in
thinking that temperance consists in not showing
the slightest sign of intoxication is as far out of it
as is Hughes in indiscriminately denouneing a
eustom that, rightly observed, is n»t without its
advantages.

The Sultan of Turkey Is rather an expense
to his unlucky subjects. This bankrupt sovereign
manages to spend X3,400,000 per annum on himself
and the eunuchs, sultanas, and courtiers that re-
side in his palace. He has three hundred cooks,
two hundred attendants to carry food from the
kitchen to the tabic, ten table-makers to arrancre
the service, and ten stewards to draw up the daily
menus. There are ten employes to unfold the
carpet on which he prays, ten coffee-roasters to
make his coffee, ten servants to clean his pipes,
twenty valets to look after his clothes, eight per-
sons to light his chandeliers, eight others to at-
tend to his aviaries, one hundred boatmen to row
his "oat on the Bosphorus, five armourers, two
hairdressers, and two hundred and fifty grooms.
Altogether, four thousand persons live at the cost
ot the impoverished people of the Turkish Em-
pire, doing nothing except ministering to the vices
J uxury of this depraved Fraud. If you
called him a depraved Fraud, in a Turkish news-
paper, you would get the soles of your feet beaten
in, and then would be strangled. Whenever h s

Disappointment at the loss of the earl and pro-
spective duke soon gave way to dismay at the
possible chance of the introduction to high
society of the new-made countess in the
enforced rdle of a reformed sister. All the
Vere de Veres said it was too dreadful for
anything. There was only one possible thing to
be done; and that was, to get rid of this very dis-
agreeable lady, who had already borne him several
children, one of them, a son, having on his father’s
elevation become Viscount Thetford. But how ?
Numerous and flagrant as were the grounds for
claiming a divorce with which Mr. Fitzroy’s wife
had furnished him while in Australia, and when
he remained without a handle to his name; just so
soon as he became the Earl of Euston she dis-
played the cunning not only of her sex, but of her
class; and the Strand, Leicester Square, the Hay-
market, and the doorway of the Criterion at night
she knew no more, and never was she guilty of
even the semblance of an unchaste act. Could he
have found but one trifling loophole since his last
condonement, it would have sufficed. But he
couldn’t. In these desperate straits, my lord re-

With most people, a “model” is an ex-
tremely improper young person, who spends her
time standing on a pedestal without any clothes,
while two or three rakish artists chip images of
her out of bits of marble, and occasionally stop to
enjoy the naughty sight. It wouldn’t do for all
of us to know everything. But this particular
Idea is quite an imaginative one. Some models
only pose for the face, others for the hands; it is,
comparitively, very few artists who study from
the nude; and when they do they don’t think of
a woman that way. Often a model has merely to
sit in her ordinary dress and read a book, or lean
over a frame, for hours. The worst posing is for a
draped figure; then the naked body is covered
with a largo wet sheet, so as to cling to the out-
lines and show the figure; a girl wants a good con-
stitution to stand that, and extra pay is given.
We once asked a handsome model if she didn’t
feel ashamed sometimes. She said: “Well, I did
at first, naturally, and only got over it by degrees;
but after a bitone takes no notice. You don't feel
uncomfortable before a lot of artists, because
you know they don’t think of you as a
woman, but only as a thing to be sketched,
a kind of animated lay figure.” And she
told us how an ardent young artist, who
had caught a glimpse of her ankles, had fol-
lowed her in the street one night with an enthu-
siastic admiration, which was terribly damped
when he discovered that she was the model he had
been copying, quite nude, about an hour before,
without taking any notice of her charms. “ But,”
she added, “though I don’t mind artists looking at
me, yet if a stranger comes into the studio, 1 hide
in no time. Just the same way, if you happen to
surprise a woman with the smallest part of her
neck accidentally exposed, she will cover herself
up to the chin, and yet, perhaps, the same evening
go to a ball in a dress open down to the middle of
er back.” Those who think of soft dalliance
going on, are in error; and a model would soon be
out of employment who indulged in anything of
the kind. Pace models are scarcer than others,
because the face is invariably wanted very pretty;
at the same time, many artists can sketch faces
from memory or imagination, who yet must have
a model to get the body correct. The pay of a
good female model averages, in French or English
studios, about eighteenpence or two shillings an
hour.
“ Lookee here, Mister,” he growled, “ I
wants this ’ere tush out, to onct, It’s bin a
givin’ me partickler fits this larst week.” The
speaker was a huge “ buck ” navvy, and the little
chemist who extracted the molars of Drought-
opolis looked up at him in distrust, as he fell with
all his weight Into a convincing chair. “Isita-a
very big one?” asked the little man, timidly.
“ Big!” (scornfully) “ Ib’lleveyer. Rutherl Why,

remarked the chemist, who didn’t half care about
the job, “ that It will be dangerous-might fracture
the jaw, eh?’’ “Fracture be- —I” was the reply;
“come, get to work; she’s got to come, an’ I shan’t
kick more’n I can ’elp.” Gazing with a shudder at
the pair of iron-olal torpedo-boats to which the
last words referred, the little z an hurriedly called
in assistance in the shape of the “ foorce,” the editor
of the local bill-stamp, and the nearest publican-
The three surveyed their subject, and didn’t like
his looks a bit, so they sent for a belly-band off the
publican’s dray, which, after some pet suasion, they
succeeded in passing round the • mud-shlitor s
waist and under the arms of the chair. Then, the
“ foorce” hanging to one leg, the press to the other,
and the lightning-disseminator grabbing the back
of his head, the operator began to grope amongst
the Ivories to the evident dissatisfaction of the
object of all this care, who kept making savage
»naps at the foreceps, attempting to ‘ shin tho
law and literature, and otherwise misconducting
himself, greatly to the delight of Droughtnpolis,
which by this time filled the street and overflowed
into the shop. Presently, however, the little
chemist got a good “ holt ” somewhere, and with
the first twist the fun began. With a roar that
would nave done honour to M’Elhone, the navi-
gator sent his leg-holders, one into the show case,
the other into the window, scalping the poison-
retaller with the back edge of the chair, as he
whirled around, trying in vain to tree himself of
it; and the operator, who still hung on, twisting,
pulling, and wrenching with all his might. The
belly-band had now somehow slipped on to his
shoulders, so, with the chair on his back, and
holding, so to speak, nine stone of chemist in his
mouth, the sufferer fairly ran a muck through the
crowd. Game to the last, the “extractor’ bung
on for a good hundred yards, till a lucky kick
from one of the excavator’s ironclads sent him

Whenever we require sound moral in-
struction (which, entre nous, we hardly ever do),
we turn to the panes of the religious weeklies or
Temperance monthlies, aad derive much benefit
therefrom. When our heart was made glad by the
intelligence that Booth, the intemperate temper-
ance man from London, would prosecute his
“Mission” in Sydney we felt like looking up
something from the publications referred to, and
were happy in falling across the very thing to
suit, instead ot going baldheaded for cold water,
and ginger-beer, and donning the blue ribbon. w 6

only drink in moderation —a toothful now and

Divine for the proper meaning of the word
moderation. That pious and worthy gentle-
man, when preaching a sermon

ever you do brethern. do it in moderation ,
and aboon a’ be moderate in dram drinking. When
ye wet up, indeed, ye may take a dram, and anither
just before breakfast, and, perhaps anither after;
but dinna ye always be dram-drinking. If ye are
out in the mornin’ ye may just brace yersel wi

but dinna be always dram-dramming. Naebody

A few more Loughlans, and Coolie immi-
gration into Victoria will have lost its fragrance
for the noses of Flinders-laue agents. Messrs.
Saunders and Co. listened to Mr. W. H. Loughlan’s
tale of culinary distress, and made an effort to put
him on the right road of having a hash when he
wanted one. For £38 7s. 6d. down, they engaged
to bring him a male Bridget from India, and after
all Bent and Bosisto told about that great country,
Mr. Loughlan cashed out the money and lay back
smacking his lips in anticipation of the hashes that
were in store. In time the Coolie came. He
trotted out and took a long, deliberate look at the
fine frenzy of the rising colonial’s appetite. He
retreated in search of ingredients. After a while
he communicated the fact that he had a dish
ready, and if his master would only partake freely
of it. such a thing as sorrow over bad victuals
would come to him n n more. It is not certain how
much saw-dust, shoe-blacking, and back hair were
in the compound, but when the sybarite snuffed it
he danced, and when he examined it he went out-
side. He went round to the agents and demanded
his money back. The affair had to go before
Judge Cope, and His Honor, after hearing about
that dish, ordered the firm of Saunders and Co. to
hand back the change, and to fork out £9 12s. 6d
as costs.
Things have been exceedingly lively in
Tungumah of late. know where Tungumah
is eh? AVoll. there’s solid ignorance If you like.
Why, they (the farmers, of course) grow bags of
wheat there, and they’ve got a railway somewhere
about, and the township consists of a waterhole, a
1 dissenting chapel of the Methody build, a fair
I supply of whisky-mills, a lock-up, a couple of
I stores, and a pound. Tungumah is situated be-
tween Benalla and nowhere (Vic.), and until about
a year ago the simple-minded inhabitants of that
I region lived and toiled in an unobtrusive, quiet
way. in peace and harmony with all men. They
were comparatively happy and contented, and in
all probability would have remained in that bliss-
ful condition to this day had not the poundkeeper
in an unguarded moment, sent the thrilling in-
telligence to the Government Gazette that a
wall-eyed, roan horse, with the "fryingpau
brand*’ on the near side, and the off-shoulder ar-
tistically illustrated with a door-key and a triangle;
an evil-scented he-goat, and a pair of unbroken
steers, were under his charge, and he further added
that if the miscellaneous collection were not re-
leased by a certain date they would be sold to de-
fray expenses. Then it Avas'that a Numurkah man
“ saw millions in in it,” and without delay dumped
down a double-demi press, a varied collection of
job-type, and an editor, at the front door, so to
speak, ot those Tungumahsters, and proceeded
to supply “a long-telt want.” Filled with a
like desire to amuse and instruct the agri-
culturists and traders ot that “ flourishing
centre,” Tom Hunt, the elect of Kilmore in the
Victorian Legislature, packed off a superannuated
printing plant, accompanied by a fire-eating editor
of the Thaddeus O’Kane stamp, to contest the field
of public patronage in Tungumah. And these
rival journals made things hum before many
moons had waxed and waned. When the Living-
stone Express played out its best snake yarn, the
Hunt Independent trumped it with the prize
cabbage story, and vice versa when the Express
got the bulge on its contemporary with a thrilling
account of the marvellous escape of the auc-
tioneer’s aunt from being gored to death by an
Infuriated hull, the Independent man would
come out with a blood-curdling narrative of a
local bush-fire that devastated a stubble paddock,
burned four chains of a “dog-leg” fence, and
literally roasted two small pigs ere the ” devouring
element ” was checked by the almost superhuman
exertions of the neighbours. But oven such
seasoned pabulum became stale after a while, and
higher flights of journalism were essayed. The
editor ot the Independent is a hot-headed jlntle-
man named O’Shea, whose surname indicates his
nationality, for, as Dr. Watts pathetically sings—
“ By Mao and O you’ll surely know
True Irishmen alway;
But if they lack the O or Mac,
No Irishmen are they.”
The O’Shea got mad over an advertisement or
something, and sat down on the gin-case that
does duty for the editorial chair of the Indepen-
dent, steeped his pen in gall, and wrote a scathing
article on a “ respectable citizen,” in which it was
insinuated that the aforesaid respectable citizen
was a horse-thief or something, and that perdition
would not be properly populated until that citizen
filled a niche in one of its sulphurous galleries.
Then came the citizen’s turn. He girt up his
loins, grabbed his ten-foot stock-whip, and, after
trying its capabilities by playfully flicking a few
pieces of hide from a dead bullock, he sallied forth
and met tho Editor. Those privileged few who
have seen Mr. Upjohn, the Victorian flagellator-
In-chief, wield the dreaded “oat,” can imagine
hoy? the respectable,; but now wrathful citizen
used the cowhide on the carcase of the O’Bhea,
who squirmed like a speared eel under the lash.
And then, to add injury to gross Insult, a meeting
of the business people of the hamlet was held
when it was decided to withdraw all their ads.
from the offending journal. The local contem-
porary of the Independent in commenting on
the affair is mildly joyous, and thinks that the
proprietor, Hunt, M.L.A., will have to defend an
action for libel Drought a gainst him by the respect-
able fiagellator of his enterprising Editor,
Taylor’s Tactics.
(Very awkward tack-tics to sit upon, too.)

The MiHer-Dinnie wrestle in Melbourne
on Saturday last resulted In a draw. Dinnie won
two Scotch style and Miller threw his opponent I
the three Graeco Roman bouts, in the final of
which he broke a small bone in his leg and was
unable to go on with the remaining round In the I
Scotch style.
The Double Bay Sailing Club is booming
along, as it is sure to do in the hands of such ener-
getic officers. We have received a copy of
their rules and regulations, from which we see
they had not the pluck to tackle the much vexed
definition of an amateur, over which the 8.A.8.O.
have had so much trouble.
Professor Cavill’s acDourned swimming
matches at the Lavender Bay baths on Saturday
list, left nothing to Cavil at. The open 500 yards
was won by K. Oavill; the little wonder, J. Rol-
lings, won the boys’ under nine race; the other
races were well contested, and a polo match fin-
ished the afternoon's sport.
On 16th and 17th of April the New South
Wales eleven r. fifteen of Queensland return
cricket match was played at Brisbane, and resulted
in an easy win for Bananaland by one innings and
17 runs. The eleven a side match then followed on,
the locals making 58 runs in their first innings,
and the visitors 162 for eight wickets (Powell 45
Callachor 27, Downes 21), when the match was
drawn.
The amateur sculling race between Brett
of Sydney and Woods of Melbourne, which
was fixed for the 3rd May. has been altered to the
10th May, to prevent clashing with the Solomon-
Gullford race. When the pair raced in Melbourne,
Brott won it as no likod, and tho Sydney man must
have deteriorated very much or the Melbourne
Improved wonderfully, to make the contest at all
Interesting.
The most interesting event at the N.S.W,
Bicycle Union Sports on 24th May will be the five

M. Bladon, who has filled the office of Hon. Sec. to

Mr. G. M. Moore takes his piece.
Says an English Magazine:— “Australians
hold catches with a far greater amount of cer-
tainty than most English players. This quality is
due partly to the si«e of their hands.” Just so.
And the British cricketers we have E0en out here
are Just as remarkable for the size of their feet,
and the hold they must get of their native heath.
If the average Britisher died standing, it wodld
take a team of bullocks to pllll him down.

Some time since, the English correspon-
dent of an American paper predicted that the
name of Charles Wood, one of the most successful
of English middle-weight jockeys of modern days,
would not appear in the first list of licensed jock-
eys, and sure enough, the said list has appeared,
Charles Wood’s name being conspicuous by its
absence. The omission is one which can be
remedied at any moment, but after the inuendos
that have been going the rounds of the press for
some time past it looks very significant.
Says the Old Lady last week: — “An
athletic contest is advertised to take place at Har-
court’s gymnasium on Thursday, between Atkin-
son, of Victoria, and Dooley, of Sydney;” which
is Granny for the fact that the worthies in ques-
tion were billed to fight with gloves for a £50 trophy
and the championship—do we ever have a match
now that is not for some championship—on the
bssement floor of a church in Llverpool-street.
However, the men proposed but the “ Beaks ”
disposed, and the fight did not eventuate.
Clarence Whistler, the Yankee wrestler,
has sent a challenge through the Melbourne
Sportsman, offering to wrestle Miller or any other
man in Australia, Grasco-Roma" or catch-as-
catch-can, for £200, either in America or Australia;
and states he will give or take £100 expenses. At
latest, Whistler and Muldoon were to have another
bout. The last time they met, Muldoon threw
Whistler and dislocated his shoulder, which may
tell against him in any future matches.
Le Grand held Martini cheap from start to
finish in the Leger, and when the time came cut
him down like a steam-saw going through a boiled
carrot. The luck of the “blue and white” is out
J.ist now, and this reminds us that not one ol
our sporting' writers had wit enough to tell us that
the man turned white with rage, when he found
he had blued his money on that son of a gun, the
colt by Musket. Such a golden opportunity for a
goak, would not have been missed by Alfred,
in what he is pleased to term his early journalistic
days.”
After all* the .great mystery of horse-
rabing is Something like that of a fiitute life. All
that thb smartest of lis know is that we know no-
thing. It *ould be hal’d to find an aatuter stable
than Soldier Boy ff, and yet his smart party backed
him for the Anniversary Handicap, , and sent
Here’s Luck td make the running for him. This
the iight weight did ih such A determined style
that neither the Soldier nor anything elie in the
race could get within cooey of him. At Canter-
bury, however, Here’s Luck carried the pot. and
then Soldier Boy walked out and trounced the
held. The poet was right after all; “There’s no-
thing true but heaven/’—Archie Forbes, and the
Nooze of course excepted.
A. A. O’Donnell is astonishing tbe natives
of Maorlland widh his bicycling tricks. Amongst
other shows, O’Donnell vaulted to the saddle with
the pedals at all angles and from either the side or
back of the machine; sat sideways, and vaulted
from one side to the other while the machine was
going, propelled himself with one foot on the stop
a f5 dot her on a pedal; sprang to the saddle,
alighting on his knees or feet, and Sent the bicycle
along without touching the pedals, by the motion
of his knees or feet. With two machines, he
balanced himself between them while in motion-
vaulted from one saddle to the other, and stood
on his head on one of the saddles after bringing
the machines to rest. Several difficult feats were
performed with three machines.
All things are under clouds at present, I
aye, even foot-racing is now suspected. In the
heats for the recent Sheffield Handicap at Bathurst
a protest was lodged against a maiden named
Wright, of Young, who, It was said, was formerly
well-known to pedestrian fame as a Mr. Hyde, and
another against Buckingham, of Goulburn, who,
it was alleged, was a good performer, and was
also sailing under false colours These competitors
asserted the charges were untrue, but upon being
asked by the committee to make statutory de-
clarations to that effect, they both refused, and
were, of course, disqualified. This looks as if the
peds. had conscientious objections as to taking an
oath, or, perhaps—but no matter.
Edwards hae gone over to the States at
the worst time he could have picked upon for
many years past, as the sawdust agony appears to
be just about played out. Big efforts were made
to bring off a six-days-go-as-you-plesse at Madison
Square Garden, New York, but without success,
Powell and Fitzgerald being the only pair to enter
for the £100 sweepstakes, and as their backers
never intended to allow them to go alone, the
affair fell through. The interest Ma died out in
these matches, as the best men at 1 game must
be getting into the sere and yellow ; iw.ausnonew
men como forward, it is far from probable that
George Hazael’s wonderful score of a fraction
over six hundred miles will ever be repeated.

Hughey Burns, the American gentleman
whom Mr, Pendergast recently guaranteed to
knock out ‘ in four rounds, is not quite a Mac-
leay Cupid. A writer in an American paper says
Hughey is the ugliest man he has ever seen. Hig
face is positively awful. Strong men have been
known to weep at the sight of him. He looks like a
caricature of one of Dote’s demons. All of his teeth
have been knocked out at various times, his jaw-
bone broken twice, one of his eyes gouged and the
other turned astray from its natural course, and
his nose has been pounded in so many diverse
directions at various times that it has apparently
become confused and compromised by spreading
in every possible direction at once. It is only
caUed a nose by courtesy. Hughey’s head is shaped
like a Flat-head Indian s, and his ears are large and
canopy. 8
Now is the period when the far-seeing
footballer hands over his guernsey to his girl to
have the moth holes darned, and lays in a stock of

showed the member’s roll numbered 70: and the

At Theatre Royal, Melb. last Thursday after-
noon, “Professor ” Miller and Edward Blackburn,
of Eaglehawk, Vic., wrestled a catch-as-catch-can
match, best three out of five falls, for £100, in the
presence of some six hundred spectators. Miller
scaled some 15 st., but Blackburn, who went 124 st.
looked in the better trim. Miller gained the flrs£
fall in 4 min., Blaekburn the second in 74 min •
the third fell to Blackburn in 9 min., and the Eaglet
hawk man gained the fourth fall and the match.
It is only fair to the “Professor” to state that his
particular forte Is the Groeco-Roman style, at
which game no man In Australia seems able to
upend him. Blackburn looks small alongside
Miller, but he shows a fine physique, and a 124 st,
man'was considered by such a judge as Captain
Barclay to be big enough to fight or wrestle any
weight that could be put before him.
The much-written-of bout between Sulli-
van and Robinson, the Pacific Slope amateur cham-
pion, came off on the 6th March at the Mechanics’
Pavilion, ’Frisco, in the presence of upwards of
twelve thousand spectators, Robinson getting one-
third of the gate-money for his part of the per-
formance. The amateur made a sorry show with
the champion slogger. He dropped fifty-seven
times in three rounds, and, had he played his hand
a bit better, ho might have lasted out the fourth •
but after going to grass, or. rather, the boards.’
eight times, Sullivan feinted, when the umpire
gave the fight against him, as he fell without a
blow being struck. Robinson stated after the
fight that he went into the ring prepared to carry
out for a couple of rounds the tactics he followed
as his friends bad backed him largely to stand two
rounds. After that he wanted to stand up before
the champion and give and take, but his seconds
positively refused to allow him to do so.
The Suburban Bicycle Club have issued
their programme, in which wo notice there are
two so-cailed “champion” races, confined to
members of the club. The term “champion ” is a
misnomer in a case of this sort, and “champion of
the club” should certainly take its place. No
doubt the suburbans are not singular in finding it
“ hard to part,” but if they left these races open to
outside competition, they would be the gainers, as
the Increased gate would more than compensate
for the loss of the prises. But it is not likely the
suburban racing men can see it in this light. And
while on the bicycle racket, we notice that the
Sydney Club have, after a deal of sparring, seceded
from the Union, at least, that is how they put it
but the other side says they only escaped expul-
sion by the skin of their teeth and a technical
point, and that after allowing the trouble to settle
down for a few months, they resigned. In the
meantime the Union held a race meeting, at which
they dropped upwards of a “century,” of which the
Sydneys refused to pay their share unless they are
allowed to audit the Union’s accounts, which offer
has been refused.
In England, the feature of the afternoon’s
talk over Mr. George Anderson’s bill for the
abolition of pigeon shooting was Colonel Totten-
ham’s attack upon Sir P. A. Mllbank, the great
North Yorks grouse-driver and battue-shooter.
He is supposed to have shot more game in one
day, more in one week, more in one month, and
more in one season, than was ever shot in the
same individual and collective periods by anv
other person. Sir F. A. Mllbank was one time an
enthusiastic pigeon shooter, but about the time
Wales was converted, and a little before the
t me Sir P. A. became Sir F. A., he took a sudden
turn against the sport, and at the time of Mr.
Anderson’s bill coming on was one of the principal
supporters of it. Colonel Tottenham said that
“ho found in 1882 the hon. baronet was the prin-
cipal actor in the slaughter of no less than 4,833
grouse on his own moors in Yorkshire, 1,161 birds
falling to his own gun.” On the occasion when
the largest slaughter of birds took place, 123 birds
were picked up the next day—(laughter and
cheers)—and these were birds which the hon
baronet said he had killed. Would he seriously
tell the House that there was not more suffering
inflicted by himself upon any one of those days
than by the whole assembly in any one of those
pigeon matches ?” Taking into consideration the
butchery of driving grouse right up to the guns,
which are fired as fast as they can be loaded-
leaded, not by the shooters themselves, but by
servants employed specially for the purpose—
sometimes with the effect of blowing the game all
to pieces, it seems wonderful how Sir F. A. could
have had the “front” to talk at length on the
horrors of pigeon shooting. The bill was talked
out without a division and, as it appears. Mr.
Anderson had a poor show of getting another
afternoon, the trap shooters regarded them-
se'ves safe for another twelve months.
Since Martini-Henry’s defeat in the St.
Leger, it’s awfully amusing to note the way in
which certain “sporting” writers dispose of his
pretensions with a stroke of the pen. A Melbourne
paper, for instance, says : “With a light weight
up, and nothing to catch him, Martini-Henry was
an idol. Now he takes a second place on the list as
a three-year-old, but will go down another step
when Off Colour is well enough to meet him.” What
utter bosh ! When Martini won the Victorian
Derby in the quickest time on record—beating Off
Colour many lengths—he carried exactly the same
weight as in t he Leger. and considerably more
than his Impost in the Champion Stakes. ‘But to

Vink a horse when he’s down has ever been the way
with sporting scribes, and “what’s last Is best”
with them. Even as, a lew weeks ago, It was
rank heresy to suggest the possibility of Mr.
White’s horse being defeated at level weights, by
another horse of his own age, so now we suppose
It would be equally heretical to refer to the poor
form shown by Le Grand, on more occasions than
one. That Le Grand is a good ’un—areal good 'un
—it would be absurd to deny—but that Martini is,
lust now, in anything like his old form, cannot
for a moment be maintained. Temper, perhaps,
has a go"d deal to do with his recent displays, and
when once a horse turns “ thief,” of course, there’s
no dependence to be placed In him ; but fit and
well and in an amiable mood, it’s quite possible
that the “ fallen idol ” will again demonstrate his
ability to show a clean pair of heels to the best of
them—not even excepting the mighty Le Grand,
THE FALLEN IDOL.
How are the mighty fallen t Poor Martini—
The joy of backers, and the dread of “sheeny’ —
Had but to know the meaning of defeat,
And (in the language of the turf) get “ beat,”
When friends, who’d o’er his triumphs waxed
elated,
At once declared him “Badly overated.”
The Noozb had a big thing on last Thurs-
day over the death of the unfortunate man Agar,
killed by the darkle Lawson in a Prize-fight that
eame off behind Kandwick Racecourse, at 8 o’clock
in the morning. The Alfred brought into requi-
sition some of its big caps for a heading of “ Fatal
Fight— a White Man Killed by a Nigger,” beneath
which it gave the best part of a column of hash
about the manner in which Agar had the life
ounched out of him. But what a different com-
Eiexion would have been put upon the affair if
awson had won the fight without a fatal termina-
tion after a severe combat lasting over an hour or
two Then the Noozb reporter would have made
a big race with the D.T. man for first interview
and bucket of stringy with “the nigger”; and in
niace of the brutal exhibition par. we should no
doubt have b ien edified with a detailed account of
the fight, round for round. It is remarkable how
f«w men have been killed or permanently in-
jured in the history of boxlana, and the fatal
fttrair of Thursday last may be looked upon
in the light of an accident as much as a
fatal fall in a Grreco-ttoman wrestling match
or the football field. If our memory serves
us aright the Nooze gave a big account of the
HinkBQ-Foley fight and rather did a “ sklte ” about
the victory of the New South Welshman, after
which it scarcely seems consistent to make such a
fiisa over last Thursday’s unfortunate affair, at
which from all accounts, the punishment was not
ffreat on either side, the fatal blow being in all
probability a chance hit. The greatest brutality
about the fight was In not taking Agar away when
it was seen he was overmatched and beaten, and
the pity is he had not a better field to show his
bravery in. Puglll-t and Rough though he might
have been, he died like a “ white man,” smiling and
Zhtlng an up-hill battle to the bitter end. How
many of the snuffle busters who now write about
him will do likewise when their time comes.
The second (Cup) day of the A.J.C.
Autumn meeting turned out damp and miserable,
f nd the general depression was not lightened, ex-
cept for bookmakers, when the Hon. James
White’s pair of cracks cam* to grief in the Cup.
The sport opened with the Flying Handicap, which
proved an easy thing for Lord Exeter by two
lengths from Kathleen, Privateer third; the
Malden Stahes proved a match between Salvo and
rairngorm. which resulted in rather an easy win
for Safvo During the running for the Cup Martini-
Henry fell at the back of the course, when his
stable companion, Morpeth, tumbled over him and
broke his leg in two places. Favo led into the
straight, closely attended bv Le Grand, but the
favourite died away when called upon, and though
Empress and Sardonyx made gallant efforts at the
distance, Favo won with plenty in hand by a
couple of lengths from Empress. Sardonyx, a

On the London Stock Exchange one day
in February last a firm received a letter from one
of their customers, announcing that he was
coming up to town that day, and would call upon
them and take awav a parcel of valuable securities
lying in their hands. In the afternoon the cus-
tomer arrived. Said one partner to the other,
* Blank, will you lend me your key of this safe, to
get out this gentlempn’s securities ? I broke mine
yesterday.” “ I never had a key of that safe,” re-
plied the junior partner. “Hadn’t you ? I thought
you had. Well, I suppose there Is nothing for it
but to send for a couple of smiths and have it
broken open.” But here the customer interposed.
“Don’t have it broken open, you can send me the
securities; I daresay they will travel quite safely.”
Before the considerate gentleman left the office the
senior partner invited him to dine with him at his
club that evening. In the course of the meal the
guest said: “Now, you have often promised to
run down and see my place, and you've never
dona it. Will you come on Saturday?” “Yes, I
will,” answered the stockbroker; “and I can bring
those securities of yours with me. That will be
safer than sending them by the rail or by post.”
“All right; that will do nicely.” But before the
Saturday arrived the stockbroker, with the securi-
ties in his portmanteau, had departed, like the
Magi, another way.
The London Figaro absolutely boasts of
being almost the first journal to advocate the
restoration of Baker Pasha to his former position
in the Imperial Army. And yet perhaps a Figaro
Is merely playing his proper role when doing such
dirty work as only a pimp and a go-between would
willingly undertake. We have spoken on more
than one occasion pretty plainly about the mon-
strous proposal to restore Baker, and pointed out
that any one In New -outh Wales committing the
olfenee, for which h® was most righteously ex-
pelled Her Majesty’s service, would be flogged.
As for the precise purgatorial value of Baker’s
recent experiences as a Turkish or an Egyptian
mercenary, It may be roughly, yet tolerably accu-
rately, gauged in this wayWould It be deemed
sufficient by the clique who are clamouring for
his restoration had his offence been cheating at
cards ? The idea of putting such a question I the
cllqueists will cry. And yet the offence he was
found guilty of was evei-y whit as blackguardly,
while a great deal more cowardly. We don’t
mean to say Baker should be trampled upon be-
cause he is down. As a rule, wo generally side
with the under dog In the fight, but In this
case our contention is that a man with a very
feul stain on his record—the stain, of a crime,
not “of cursed ill-luck,” as the London
Punch euphulstlcally puts it In Baker’s ease-
ls not the man to entrust with military command,
however sincere his penitence may be. Baker s
restoration would be a most disastrous precedent,
specially In an army the morale of which Is not a
bit too high, knelling as It would most assuredly
do the death of the wholesome theory that at least
E resumes an officer to bo a gentleman. Ruskio,
eneath whose exaggerative quaintness runs ever

speaking to the soldier,—“ So the first thing

every virtue of the higher phases of

For years past, the fine black broadcloth
has been gentlemen’s only wear tor evening
parties. Which has led to the frequent remark
that “ you can’t tell which are the gentlemen, and
which are the waiters.” But with a little experi-
ence you soon get able to tell. The waiters are
always sober. There is, however, some prospect
of a change which will do away with this dreadful
similarity. The perfectly plain broadclotn js not
now a necessity for gentlemen, and many dress
suits have been made of diagonal, or basket
pattern in black: coat, waistcoat, and trousers all
from the same piece. There are silk linings, and
narrow braid edging on cuffs, collar, &c. The
elasticity of diagonals and the development of the
tailor’s art enable the coats to be cut closer to the
figure than of old, and yet give greater ease
to the motions of the body. Whito vests are still
correct for those who prefer them.

A curious business lately sprung up in
large cities of the Old World Is that of Agencies
which provide society young men to those who
give parties—or, as they are often called, *' func-
tions.” It seems significant of the disastrous
spread of Fltznoodllsm in modern drawing-rooms
that hostesses, who desire to have their guests
entertained in a polite and rational way, are
obliged to hire men to do it. Yet it is a fact that
these Agencies do a very large business. There is
less and less tendency on the part of the Fitznoodle
of the day to make himself generally agreeable.
Talk, he cannot. Dance, he positively will not do.

etiquette, with the one favoured partner all the

Bit with their backs to the wail. It is outside of
his ideas of duty to make anyone happy but
himself. The hostesses of London parties
have but one cry, “ the men won’t dance.”
And yet the girls must have partners. In
the hired society man, agreeable manners and
power of entertaining are essential. When he ap-
plies for employment at the Agency,he is examined,
and will probably be requested to give an example
of his musical and conversational powers, and to
show how he waltzes. If he is good at these, can
play whist, lawn tennis, &c., and his a fair appear-
ance, constant employment is a certainty. One
evening perhaps ho is called upon to attend a whist
party, when he is expected to be a thoroughly
good player, and yet he must be careful not to
win too often. Next day, possibly, there is a lawn
party, or a lively spirit '8 wanted for a picnic or
boating excursion. He must know all the games,
be cheerful, self-possessed, polite, and never tired.
The career of another employe will he specially in
the direction of musical evenings. But the great-

The Queens of Sons have been .making a
sublime triumph hi San Francisco—we mean Patti
and Gerster. At her hotel, Patti patted round with
the glee of a child, wearing a short white dress of
nun’s veiling, simple, but irresistibly well made,
and a lace scarf that flashed like a lighthouse every
movement she made—for that scarf carried her
celebrated, and almost priceless, diamonds. Sper-
anza conducted the band which serenaded ter.
Patti leaned over the rail as fierce, discordant
shrieks arose from the orchestr i, and waved her
handkerchief ecstatically, ns though she had never
heard such music before. Probably she never had.
Speranza meant, well, of course, and God will for-
give him because he perpetrated it in a spirit of
patriotism, the purest and most exalted of motives.
As she moved about, she was attended by an
Italian on each side, while Nicolini brought up the
rear; but the crowd pressed so that, in spite of their
efforts, the little woman had not the room to move
that nature had intended her to have inthetoheme
of space. Gerster is little less famous than Patti,
and when she sang, her audience declared a more
glorious burst of rru*dc never came from the
throat of a cantatrlce. Some men listened in in-
tensest feeling, and many more grow red with
excitement. They huzzahed themselves out of all
dignity, and grinned like baboons with simple
pleasure. A grin under such circumstances be-
comes ennobled. The women smiled — placid,
fishy, beautiful things that they are. They did not
grin. They were sitting there in serried ranks,
clutching huge bouquets of hot-house flowers, In
the excess of their emotion; but sang she never so
sweetly, they continued to clutch. Only one in all
the house flung a flower to the prlma donna—a
modest little twenty-ttve-cent wad of violets. The
other thousands marched out, a long procession of
beautiful, well-draped, hair-dressed women, with
their b uquets safe in hand, unwilted by the
■warmth of their throbbing, rapturous breasts.
And a nice, long, mean, cold, selfish, stingy pro-
cession they made I
In America there are many girls who are
either very beautiful or very rich, or both. Of
late it has been quite the rage among these charm-
ing girls (daughters, mark you, of such a very
democratic country) to expect titled young Eng-
lishmen as husbands. The theory is that the im-
poverished scions of noble houses are not at all
averse to recuperating their lowered fortunes by
alliances with the daughters of the millionaire
railway kings, silver kings, cattle kings, and other-
kings, in which that republican country is so pro-
lific. According to what w® hear, it is with the
greatest difficulty Mary Anderson keeps clear of
the coronets and crowns and fortunes that are
showered at her feet; and it is well-known that
nothing but the fact of the Prince of Wales being
married prevented Florrle Chamberlayne walking
him off long ago. Lady Mandeville actually did
capture a British nobleman. Well, in case the
American girls should get; too much oppressed
with the idea of their own irresistibleness,
a amd E nglishman has written them a cheerful
letter. It appeared in a Frisco paper. We give
quotations for what they are worth “ The doors
of the first society of England do not open to mere
wealth, no matter how pertinacious and pushing.
Many of that society’s most brilliant and respected
members are poor; yet no shoddy millionaire
could get an in Ration to a Belgravia or Mayfair
drawing room unless by an accident. American
women are delighted about their own beauty ?
Well, look at them. I will be bound not one of
them has the clear eye. the rosy complexion, the
sound, firm, white teeth, that betoken perfect
health. Look at them when thirty more years
have passed over their heads, and compare them
with the same number of English men and women
of the same age,and see which makes the best show-
ing. About their enormous social success ? I deny
this ‘ enormous success,’ American newspapers to
the contrary notwithstanding. She has to take a
back seat in Europe unless chaperoned by some
one whose social standing is unquestioned, and
then she will find it difficult enough to hold her
own. I am aware there is one beautiful American
girl who maided the heir of a dukedom, but ho
had gone to the dogs anyway, and he would have
found some difficulty in marrying any stunning
beauty in England. Let me give one word of
advice to wealthy girls who are ambitious of
marrying a title, and to wealthy parents who are
scheming to bring about such an alliance, and
that word of advice is‘Don’t.’ You make your-
selves and your daughters ridiculous in the
effod, and then fail most probably; but
should you succeed, you have put your
daughter in a position she is in no ways
fitted to fill. This may be cynical, but it is
true, for the topmost plane of English society re-
presents seven hundred years of culture and
breeding, and to-day It is the most aristocratic,
the most exclusive, and the most elegant in the
world. They all bear the stamp of high breeding
It is born in them and grows up with them, and
was not put on as a garment alter their fathers
made a fortune in cotton, or pork, or oil, or mines,
or railroads. It is a fact not generally known that
a man with an American wife is seriously handi-
capped in England. She is rather looked down
upon. I have in mind a Pacific Coast heiress who
married a title, and she is frequently spoken of,
rather irreverently and ungaflantly, as the ‘mus-
tang.’ Therefore, if Amercan girls are wise they
will not go to England for a h....oand.” If the man
who wrote this kind letter is still alive, it is pro-
bably because ho is not still in America, or in any
place where the rich and beautiful American girls
can get at him.

On Friday night, the second of a series
of fortnightly socials occurred in Tattersall’s
Hall, which looked bright and pretty. It is in-
tended to have twelve during the winter, and a
special one as a finale in September. Dancing was
announced to commence at half-past seven, but
the members, with the lightheartedness of youth,
treated this announcement with joculardisregard.
This is a free country, so they started to dance
when they were ready, which was soon after eight
o’clock. About 70 preseut left plenty of room,
and as Shapter and Herman played, the music for
the pattering feet was almost ideally rhythmical,
and 10 items were comfortably managed before
midnight, Mr. A. Pearce being a good M.C. Light
refreshments were handed round, and these trifles
are always appreciated at dancing parties, no
matter how early they break up.

daughter of Mr. J. D. Elphinston, of “ Inverness-
vllle,” Woolley-street, Globe. On the charming
bride, who was attired in a wory corded silk,
trimmed with Florence lace, with delicate veil,

Elphinston and L. Elphinston, in blue t-ilk ;
Miss Dunlop (Woolloomooloo), Miss Macintosh
(Darlirg Point), Miss Spalding (Glebe), all in pink
silk ; and Misses Minnie Elphinston, McMaster,
Harvey and Morris in cream ; and a delicious
spectacle they looked, with happy faces, and no
doubt pleasant anticipatory visions flitting
through their minds. Eighty guests, including
clergymen, sat down to a dainty breakfast, spread
by Correy, in the Nithsdale Rooms, when the
usual felicitous speeches were made, after which,
the happy pair started for Mount Victoria.

The Palmerston Musical and Dramatic
Society (Q.) gave a performance recently, which
netted £25. A fair prologue was written by the
local laureate, Mr. H. F. Galbraith, and its recital
gave the audience an opportunity to walk around
looking for good seats, and to shift their chairs
about till they got comfortable. Then “ Caught
by the Cuff” and “Bombastes Furioso ’ were
given, followed by a concert, which would have
been pretty good if some of the performers had
been able to sing. One song was especially tear-
ful; it was called ‘‘Wrap him up in his tarpaulin
jacket.” We must remember it’s comparatively
a new country up there.

A gross outrage was recently perpetrated
at the Haymarket Theatre, London. Prominent
sportsmen obscure solicitors, county magnates,
grave-looking barristers, mashers of the first
water, and many men whose bloom of youth has
lied, all wended their way from all parts of the
country to tho Haymarket in response to the fol-
lowing Invitation, in a lady’s handwriting “The
writer of this is anxious to have the pleasure of
meeting you. She will be at the Haymarket
Theatre on Tuesday. If you will be in the stalls
you will not fail to recognise her ; hut to show
that this meeting is agreeable, will you wear a
button-hole of violets and lilies of the valley, and
she will wear scarlet geraniums ?” Some fifty or
sixty men, decorated with lilies and violets, mus-
tered in tho stalls—only to hurriedly depart, mur-
muring to themselves in strong language. The
only person in the theatre who wore scarlet gera-
niums was an ancient lady of uncertain age, who
was very much astonished at the notice she
attracted.

The clever hostess of Cosheston House
gave a brilliant evening party on the 18th to her
numerous young friends. Dancing commenced
at nine, at twelve they sat down to a substantial
as well as rec'icrcM champagne supper, after which
dancing was resumed with renewed vigour, until
past three. We are interdicted from writing
up tho many and varied costumes, but at the
risk of reproof, we must mention a pink and a
blue bell, who wore the belles of the room.

Last Thursday, the ball given by the Hon.
James and Mrs. White took place In the Exhibition
Building. Some 500 ladle? and gentlemen accepted
Invitations, and the building- was In fine order.
For some time previously it'had been undergoing
renovation. The fountain no longer sheds its dia-
mond spray-drops into the dingy-looklng basin,
around whose edge a dangling fringe of sym
metrical ankles has so often charmed the gaze of
the interested beholder. It has been removed,
leaving a clear dancing area, where the enthu-
siasm of the “emphaticdancer” will have room
to develop Itself—where, on Thursday night, the
strong-limbed men, and stately women “ with
feathers crowned and gay embroidery dressed,”
had nothing to stop them as they pursued their
mazy way. The whole floor space has been
planed, and the benefit was greatly appreciated by
the dancers. It was enclosed by hangings of white
and blue, with opening lace curtains which led
through into a promenade on one side, and on the
other into a card and smoking room, and a vast
drawing-room studded with sofas, lounges, and
chairs. Sale and Dare decorated the whole build-
ing in a way seldom seen, and with several ingeni-
ous novelties in the arrangements. There were
the usual long festoons of fresh twisted leaves and
| foliage; behind the gas globes were star ferns, and
beneath each one a large mirror; while flowers,
crowns, wreaths, and armorial bearings were dis-
posed around in all directions. At the Redfern
end, was the supper table, where all the luxuries
were purveyed by Compagneni, and champagne’s
amber light reflected the bright liquidity of
beauty’s sparkling eyes. The band played on the
dais, which has been newly fitted up with thin
sounding boards, and was ornamented with rows
of pot plants, flowers, and shrubs. Under the
galleries was the only flaw in the place, and there
the new asphalting had not set, being somewhat
soft and sticky, so that it had to be covered. A
special porch was erected outside the entrance
door, and special arrangements made by the tran-
sit officers for vehicles. Among the company, a
deal of colour was displayed, the military red and
navy blue uniforms, resplendent with gold lace
and all the other glorious embellishments, which—
in the feminine idea, at any rate, are always
associated with vast capacities for heroism
in the devoted defenders of the country,
making the leading sex unusually gay. In
such a field of action, their arms were only
required for peaceful purposes. Ladies were pre-
eminent as ever for costliness and beauty of
apparel, which is, anyhow, absolutely insignificant
compared with their own charms. All the most
modish shades and shapes were seen, but light
dresses were most favoured—
“Illustrious robes of satin and of silk,
And wanton lawns more soft and white than
milk,”
as the poet sings. We don’t understand how a robe
can be softer than milk. It isn’t milk that the poet
drinks as a rule, and perhaps he’d forgotten what
it’s like. But that is what he said, and we give in
that poets know more about ladies than we do.
And, by the way, we have noticed that poets often
say things about ladies that an ordinary man would
be kicked for. But re these toilets: some of them
were remarkable fora free independence of outline
which stood out with bold effect as they swirled
In ever-winding circles, and the floor was not
crowded. Blue and white were worn in several
cases, donned no doubt in honour of the toast;
and Mrs. White, of course, wore her husband’s
colours, combined in a beautiful dress. The bodice
was white velvet and satin, long train, the gown
Itself of blue ottoman satin veiled in lace, pearls
on neck and hair, and blue gloves. The pro-
grammes were prettily conceited by Turner and
Henderson, exactly representing a pair of blue
steel horseshoes filled in with white ; on one
cover was the date embossed, and on the
other a racehorse. A double leaf was Inside,
making six pages. The waltzes were Yenetia,
Thine Alone, Blue Danube, Casino Tanze, Phie
D'Or, Dragoon Guards, Dream Faces, The Col-
onel, Love Songs, Souvenir, Gloiro de Dijon, and
Ruby, other dances totalling up to 20. Being given
at race time, when visitors to town are plentiful,
there was an element of manhood more observable
than is usual at metropolitan balls. The sturdy
tread of the solid squatter, the bold faces browned
on th« shadeless plains of the great thirsty West,
were in strong contrast to the lighter city phy-
sique, and to the clear complexions which enable
the usual ball-infesting young gentleman of the
city to compare with even the ladies themselves in
alabaster purity of skin. Many ladies were from
country parts, too, and in no way behind their
brilliant city sisters in style and fashion. All alike
appreciated the delicious conservatory that was
built in a quiet corner behind the dais, if one
might judge from the numerous couples d deux
who unostentatiously strolled into its cool recesses,
where the ferns tempered both light and sight
from being too intrusive We think the race ball
will long be a memory with some of those who sat
among the ferns, where, from above, the little
swinging Cupids looked appropriately down on
the telling of the sweet old story, that was told In
Eden, witl bo told tor ever, and keeps our little
world agoing.

The Eureka Ball takes place on Tuesday
week, fith May, in Tattersall’s Hall, and the artis-
tic tickets are now out. As they are a reasonable
price, the hall is spacious and convenient, and
either plain or fancy dress may be worn, w« can’t
see why everyone shouldn’t go, who cares to spend
a tow shining hours pleasantly.

Last Saturday, the Sydney Amateur Can-
vas Dingy Cluu closed their first season by evolu-
tions in Farm Cove, and a luncheon at Cremorne.
This club, though young, is flourishing—formed
only in May, 1883, with 10 members and three boats,
it now comprises over 50 members and 20 boats.
They have been successful in numerous races
since September last, and prizes (some of which
were shown in Paling’s last week) have been
chiefly, and in a creditable spirit of liberality,
given by senior officers of the club. About 3
o’clock the Mascotte steamed away with visitors,
who had a fine view of the evolutions performed
by about a dozen boats, the signal boat being the
Olivette, under Commodore George Snow, and on
conclusion, the whole flotilla bore off to Cremorne,
where Dr. F. Milford and party Joined from his
yacht. The group was photographed by Baylis, and
then all sat down to a cheery luncheon provided by
W.H.Moon in good style. It vanished quickly before
the “ peckish ” crews of the canvas yachtlets, and
toasts followed. Dr. Milford proposed the Queen;
Mr. Breckcurlg, Our Gests; Mr. E. Wangenhelm,
the Senior Officers, to which Mr. Vicepresident
Herbert Underwood replied. The other Officers
were then proposed by Mr. Jas Snow, and Mr.
George Snow in reply gave a brief history of the
Club and its doings, and hoped all members would
be present at the annual election of officers next
May. The toast of Other Sailing Clubs was given
by Mr. George Hellings, who pointed out that
amateur sailors were free from the suspicion
which now-a-days has left Its taint on almost every
other sport—the taint of dishonesty. They be-
lieved in fair “sailing,” not in “selling” races.
After Messrs. Mllson, Milford and Underwood had
acknowledged, Mr. J. R. Drultt gave “The Sydney
Amateur Canvas Dingy Club,” responded to by
Mr. Herbert Downs, non. sec. Then the Ladles
were proposed by Mr. H. Harding; the Press by
Mr. F. Eicbler, and amid vociferous cheering the
Honorary Secretary by Mr. Helling. Dr. Milford’s
health was honoured, and then a rush was made
for the boats, the Daisy getting away first, and the
steamer load landing again at Circular Quay ab«ut
6 o’clock, after a most agreeable outing. It should
be said that the S.A.C.D. Club invited a number of
visitors from other clubs, there being about 80 in
all at the table, and they also provided handy pro-
grammes of the day’s proceedings.

Sydney, Wednesday.
My Dear Belle,—Everybody says we are having
regular English April weather. Well, if we are,
1, for my part, don’t like it. It’s full of deceit:
raining one hour, and sun shining the next. If we
go out, wo must either cover our finery with ul-
sters or carry the cumbersome necessaries, or else
run the risk of returning home reduced to a pulp.
There is one thing to be said in favour of the
rubber waterproofs, and that is, although they
look very ugly, they will squeeze into a much
smaller parcel than the thick tweeds. We were
on our way to th« matinee, last Wednesday, when
down came the rain; and one of our party, who
thought more of her comfort than her personal
appearance, donned her macintosh, hood and all,
and looked exactly like a Laplander. She was re-
paid for her courage by arriving at the Hall as dry
as a bone, and could afford to smile at our draggled
feathers and limp hair.
For such a miserable afternoon [the attendance
at the matinee was very encouraging, and augurs
well for the success of the undertaking. Miss
Thompson and Mr. Maclean opened the concert,
with Beethoven’s Septett arranged as a duet for
piano, which is one of those classical compositions
that “take” at a first hearing. Madame Marias
took one or two liberties with the cavatina from
“H Trovatore ” which were hardly justifiable.
I have often noticed a propensity in some singers
to dwell on and make much of any pet note
they may possess, but this can hardly be done
with impunity in the case of such well-known
solos as Madame Marius essayed on Wednesday
night. In “Esmeralda,’’ however, she was very
spirited, and won an encore. Miss Thompson sang
a very pretty song, “What shall I siy then,” by
Lohr, and her voice, though not over-powerful,
was in this very pleasing. Lohr has written several
nice songs, but this one in question is one of the
prettiest, and will, I think, become popular. I
don’t remember ever hearing Signor Beneferi’s
voice to better advantage than in “ Cedi ah Cedi.”
Though not of the purest quality, his organ is
powerful and well managed. A tiny girl in a red
silk frock and cream muslin pinafore surprised us
by a very clever violin solo. The little mite was
evidently nervous, for whilst her master, Herr
Kretchmann, was tuning her violin, her hands
shook so much that we felt certain of a break
down. But not so; her solo was [bravely played,
although, for so young a child, it was far from easy.
Herr Kretchmann reminds me of our old music-
master, dear, in this, that he gives his pupils
pieces which are rather beyond them, so that
simpler ones will be a kind of rest, and practised
with pleasure; but he makes a mistake, I think, in
allowing his pupils to exh’bit their full capacity in
public; it is much m \e comfortable to the
audience to feel that there is some reserve power
In the performer. Herr Ketchmann is peculiarly
fortunate in possessing so many prodigies amongst
his pupils, and I hope we shall have an opportunity
of hearing young Smith again soon. Miss Thomp-
son showed great presence of mind as Mr. Mac-
lean, who accompanied, also did, in the duet
“O. Would that the Love,” when Madame Marius
accidentally skipped a page. By continuing, as if
nothing had happened, they managed to pick
Madame up, but the item wasn’t one of their suc-
cesses. I was sorry Miss Thompson did not play
more than one solo, and am certain we would
gladly have dispensed with one of the vocal items
to make room for another exhibition of her fine
playing.
The hall looked very pretty, being tastefully
decorated with flowers and shrubs, and scattered
here and there were little round tables, which
gave it quite a sociable appearance. Added to
this, we had a cup of Quong Tart’s refreshing
tea, handed round during the interval. Miss
Thompson wore a deepish blue satin skirt, with
short basque of blue and pink brocaded satin.
Madame Marius, in black cashmere and silk, with
a tasteful black bonnet with amber chenille
wreath, looked extremely well. Am ongst tbe
Audience there was a pale lavauder brochd and an
electric blue cashmere, but the dubious weather,
no doubt, was answerable for the scarcity of gay
attire.
For the sake of old times, we went to see Webb’s
Marionettes one night last week. I remember
when we were children we werefllled with wonder
and admiration with these same Marionettes, but
the children of to-day are altogether too sharp. I
heard one exclaim contemptuously : “ Why, ma, I
can see quite well how they do it-look at the
strings I Why, I am sure I could do it just as
good,” and so on. But, at the same time, however
patent the mechanism might have been to this
young eight-year-old, he had to laugh at the per-
formance, and heartily, too. To impatient chil-
dren the ten minutes interval seems as if it were
at least half an hour, and it was amusing
the other night to observe their different devices
to while away the time. Some spelt the pro-
gramme over afresh, others would have a game at
“ hands over,” and I heard two setting eacn other
“initial letters” which was best of all. “I give
youK” said a little fairy to her juvenile beau,
“ and it is for a bird.” After a lot of pressing it
was given up when the little lady said with a sup-
erior air, “ Why Aanary, you goose.” After some
more guessing an birds they decided they were
“too easy ” and said the initial might be for any-
thing in the whole world.” whereupon my little
gentleman gave “O.” Casting her eyes upward
in deep thought his partner pondered for a moment
and suddenly exclaimed “Oliver Cromwell.”
“ Not quite, but you’re near it, oh, you’re awfully
near it.” " Is it a person then ?” lispingly ques-
tioned the child, “ Well, no, not exactly, but
you’ll soon guess if, why I just thought you were
going to say it that time.” The little maid re-
knitted her brows and puzzled her pretty head to
find the word, but it was all in vain, it had to be
“ given up.” “ Quick, quick tell me, the curtain is
just going up.” “Well then listen— Orange Peel.
We are full of curiosity about “Populaire” so
went to Palings rooms on Saturday afternoon and
had quite a comfortable time. We sat up in the
gallery as it’s far the best place if you want to hear
well. I think 1 can truthfully °ay that the pretty
little opera pleased us all, and Indeed some were
quite enthusiastic about it. Wo have been hum-
ming “ Blessoras of Springtide” and “Who shall
bo winner ” ever since, and as the former song has
been published separately I will post it to you, for
I know you will like it. I do hope Messrs Moser
and Maclean will see their joint work well pro-
duced in Sydney at no distant date. Mrs. Dobbie
(ne<4 Miss Foxall) sang the principal soprano solos,
and, as is usual with her, put her heart and soul
into her work. Miss Chizlett also took one solo
and was much applauded. I was glad to see Mr.
Morgan mixing in musical circles again, but ho has
hardly recovered his voice after his long
illness. Mr. Hallowell helped not a little to give
the bass solos a good show. I saw Miss Josephine
Deakin sitting near the orchestra, and thought it
so nice ot her to help in the choruses. It showed
a truly amiable and generous disposition. By the
way did you ever receive that book I sent you
“ The Parsonage Girl?” It is by the same author
as the libretto of “ Populaire,” Mr. Thomas Moser,
so I should like to know what you think of it.
The Illustrations are, as I have no doubt you
have found out before now, oy Livingstone Hop-
kins (we never Mr. great men, you know, dear) and
altogether, it's a tidy little book, and a credit to
Sydney, I think.
Do you know, dear, it irritates me fearfully to
see blind men standing, day after day, doing noth-
ing but holding their idle palms out to passers-by
for money, and looking so strong and hearty the
while ? It isn’t nice, I know, to say hard things
about these afflicted creatures, but I never can
believe that they could not train their fingers to
•omo sort of industry, were it ever so trivial. And
how awfully monotonous it must be for them to
go through the same programme every day 1 But
they never look the least bit weary, quite the re-
verse, Indeed.
Fancy, I saw a lady to-day in a bronze and gold
granite stripe dress, made with a plain tucked skirt
just gathered on to the waistband, which was
joined on to the body. It looked so quaint; but
none but a stylish lady could have worn It, as it
was almost severe in its plainness. A bizarre cos-
tume was a fawn cashmere with ruby plush pointed
panels, and on each point was a large chenille
pompom—ruby soft felt hatwith notrimming save
a bird of same coloured plumage fastened on the
left side. I have seen, lately, several dark green
and blue cloth costumes trimmed with gold or
silver braid, and they are about the most effective
and useful for ordinary winter dresses that I
know of. Those bunches of sdk-worm chenille
which you admire so much are not only for hat
ornaments, but are also worn in the hair by ladles
who have seen their most youthful days. A new
stylo of evening glov® is made with armlets of
lace, which reach to the elbow. I fancy these are
made for the reason that kid does not cling well to
the »rm, and the lace does. And I think that is all
this time. Ever yours,
MAB.
The bicycle race which was to have taken
place on the Agricultural Society’s Ground on
the 5th April, between Chapman, of Sydney, and
Rolfe, of Melbourne, Champion of Australia, was
postponed owing to the ground being damaged by
the recent heavy rains, and will come off on the
Association Cricket Ground on the 5th of May.
Both men are in good condition, and each confi-
dent of success; but Rolfe is generally looked
upon as being the probable winner. Rolfe has
Birch, of Melbourne, to look after him, while
Chapman has the services of his old trainer,
Barney Crookes.
Some sixty years since John Blackham, of
London, provided conversationalists for parties.
He had six hundred on his books, warranted, like
“ the miller Grindoff, To talk a dog’s leg the hind
off.” They had each a valise ready packed, and
were prepared to start in any direction at any
moment. In this army of talkers were three
Scotch peers and seven Irish noblemen, fifteen
baronets, and a whole regiment of officers, whilst
the fair sex was represented by one hundred and
eighty-seven unappreciated blessings of unim-
peachable virtue and limited means. “All of
these,” said Blackham. “play at cards greatly to the
advantage of their partners ” Four meals per
diem were to be provided for these guests, “and
claret if one of them is a Scotch or an Irish
peer.”
At a meeting of the Salvation Army, the
other day, there rose up, among [sundry sinners
who wished to confess tbeir misdemeanours in
public, a Dutchman, who proceeded to harangue
the congregation as follows Mein friends, I
wish to let you all know how I found Yesus I At
von time I vas sailor ralt a ship called a deep
vaterma". I was not long on de sea pefore I learn
to schwear most awful. De men all schwear, so I
schwear too for Dere was no thought

down in de truck, and pray and pray to the Lord
Yesus for the storm to cease. After dot, I sehvear
bo more, for de vind went down and de shtorni vas
passed. An’ so I found Yesus, mein friends.” At
this point, a man-o'-war’s man in the crowd
chipped in with " And where the was the
mate all this time, you lop-eared son of a ?”
causing a shout of laughter, during which the
Dutchman w»s hustled off the platform, and
another penitent started his reminiscences. F»r
the information of those who are not “up” in
nautical science, it may be mentioned that the
“ post of danger” referred to by the convert is the
easiest pi ms in the ship, where the boys are usually
sent.
Political Points
Connaught will pass the summer at Nus-
sowri (a pleasant hid station) instead of at Meerut,
the centre of his command. This in complete
bouleversement of ordinary regulation. Some-
how we think a Nussowri (anglice nursery) quite
place for Arthur. Besides, why should
a prince of blood royal be expected to stick to the
mere rut of regulation ?
The report of Commissioner A. O. Mori-
arty on Conditional Purchases contains, in addition
to a lot of figures, a most flattering account of
A. O. Moriarcy’s zeal, intelligence, and industry,
and an equally buttery testimony to the efficiency,
freedom from bias, &c., of +he inquiry courts
commissioners. That the country newspapers
teem with complaints against the circumlocution,
and worse of Moriarty’s branch, of course, goes
for nothing, for does not Moriarity himself report
“ All’s well.”
The Albury Banner complains that sev-
eral conditional purchasers down that way on ap-
plying for their certificates have been referred to
land agents who, in their turn, expect payment
tor delivery. Why doesn’t the Banner publish
the names of the selectors, land agents and officials
concerned, and so help to bring the matter to a
focus ? On all sides there are rumours afloat
tending to show that the Lands Department is a
hundred-fold worse ministered by Farnell than
ever It was by Garrett—which is saying a lot!
There are two legislative candidates for
Gundagai, and their names are Want and Watson.
Should Mr. Watson fail of being elected “ Want
will be his master,” as was the case with the boy
who didn’t get the pudding. Should Want be de-
feated his first inquiry will doubtless be:—’“Watson
a name ? ” In any case the result will plainly indi-
cate what the people of Gundagai want, and what
they do not, If they want Want they won’t
want Watson, and Watson, will want Want to
want the office with a much greater want than
he has ever wanted it. So—(this correspondence
must now cease.— Ed. B.)
The Nooze says that Taylor’s “Amalga-
mation” Bill would, if passed, be “a rascally
fraud upon private rights.’’ No doubt the Giraffe s
proposal might be made more comprehensive, but
even as it is, whose private rights does it invade ?
Those of the barrister, cries the Nooze. But
barristers, as barristers, have no private rights.
Michie, Q.C., who is a shrewd, long-headed old fel-
low, and an authority on points of this kind,
maintains that the legal profession has no legiti-
mate vested interests, and that the question of
compensation is not one that can honestly arise
out of any legislative interference with the traj
ditional privileges of either barrister or attorney.
The Chinese have many customs well
worthy of imitation by nations who pretend to view
the Celestial with contempt. And possibly none of
their customs is more deserving of being followed
than that of attaching a real meaning to the thing
that we call “responsibility.” Wltn us, when a
responsible minister makes a disastrous blunder,
he is simply kicked out of office; with the Chinese,
he would in ail likelihood be publicly degraded, if
not decapitated. Of course, the custom is one
that could be carried to extremes, yet still there’s
such a lot of common sense about it that we beg
to suggest to the Giraffe the propriety of at once
introducing an Incapable Minister’s Decapitation
Bill. Were such a measure to become Jaw, the
portfolio for—oh, a lot of portfolios—would pre-
cious soon be vacant.
Nobody under the rank of a Field Officer
is eligible to be appointed to the Gentlemen-at-
Arms. Such the regulation. Lord Edward
Somerset, however, has just been gazetted to that
Corps, though he Is not a Field Officer. SaysLabby
with, and in, Truth:—“It is really monstrous
that scores of old and distinguished officers, whose
claims are old and manifold, should be quietly
passed over in order to provide for a young man
whose sole recommendation is his connection with
a ducal family, the members of which have ab-
sorbed £540,000 of the public money during the
last thirty years.” The Gentlemen-at-Arms prior
to 1834 were called Gentlemen Pensioners (estab-
lised 1509.) The Corps consists of a Captain (Lord
Carington) ; a Lieutenant (Lt. Col. Sir G. Hume) ;
a Standard bearer (Major Taylor); a clerk of the
cheque (Major Tillbrook); a sub-officer (Col.
Sandeman), and 40 members.
“Silver Pen” is the nom deplume of the
San Francisco correspondent ot the Auckland
Weekly News. Wo don’t know “Silver Pen’s”
other name, but we do know that she has the
longest noso for scandal of any woman who over
undertook to write for the press. There is nothing
rotten in American society that "Silver Pen”
doesn’t scent out and make haste to shovel into
the columns ot her paper; and there is nothing
good in the social or political life of our Ameri-
can cousins that ever catches the eye of this
scandal-loving female. There is, perhaps, a
very good reason lor this in the fact that the
person’s social status docs not bring her in
contact with much that is refined or desirable.
To any one who has Jived in the States, or has
travelled through them, there is nothing whicb
seems more unfair than the manner in which cor-
respondents write to Antipodean and continental
papers concerning American affairs. Nearly every
last mother's son or daughter of them seems to
wallow about in the back slums of the great cities,
and are never able to get their noses high enough
in the social scale to catch a pure breeze from any
quarter. “ Silver Pen’s ” latest sweeping assertion
is:—“ The Americans are very smart in more ways
than one. In fact, too smart for honesty, and they
will get the best ol their nearest and dearest—I
believe they would go back on their mother for
£4.” We are quite of the conviction that this
slanderous female could make money by selling
her interest in heaven for a much less sum than
that.
Thus the Fortnightly' The fact can-
not be ignored that the submission of the Merv
Turcomans to the Czar coincides with the nowly-
established understanding between Russia and
Germany. Tbe chance of a Franco-Russian offen-
sive alliance, and of the hegemony over tbe
Southern Slavs, was lost, partly by the aversion of
Servians and Bulgarians to Panslavism. Russia
found on her way to Constantinople, not only
Austria, but the small nations she had liberated
from the Turks, and, wisely or unwisely, she gave
up the struggle for Constantinople, and betook
herself to seek the “ key to the sea” somewhere
else. This explains the sudden change in her atti-
tude towards Germany, the removal of Russian
troops from the German frontier, and the recast-
ing of Russian representatives in the three western
capitals. The mere transfer of Prince Orloff from
Paris to Berlin Implies a revolution in Russian
politics. There is no other diplomatist in the
Russian chanceilerie whose person alone indicates
as friendly an attitude towards the power he is
officially accredited to as that of Prince Orloff. He
is the counterpart of Ignatieff. As the latter w.ll
always be the evil spirit ot the State where he
represents Russia, so Orloff will ever prove her
guardian angel. Ignatieff would be chosen to
deliver a declaration of war; Orloff to offer a
treaty of alliance. As long as France presenteu
tne possibility of a future Russian ally, Orloff was
in his place at the Russian embassy in the Rue St.
Dominique; as soon as this possibility was gone,
Orloff’s occupation in Paris was gone also.”
Sir Henry Parkes is once more on the war-
path; (writes from Paris, under date March 13th, an
old friend). He seems to be dividing his time be-
tweeu the vain search for financial “ fiats ’’ in
London, and airing his political opinions His
latest move is in connection with the New Hebrides
question; and by the last Messageries packet I
sent you a copy ot Le Matin, a smart little paper
published here, giving the details of a conversa-
tion which its London correspondent had with the
Australian Jeremy Diddlcr, and which would bo
amusing were It not that the opinions of a man
who pompously describes himself as the late Chief
Minister of New South Wales, and who averts
that his visit to Europe is specially in connection
with this question, are apt to be considered
important by those who do not know that Sir
Henry Parkes is not entrusted with any political
mission whatever, and that he has no authority
to speak on behalf of the colonists of Aus-
tralia. The particulars of this interview have not
Impressed people here greatly with his political
sagacity. The puerile threat of closing the Aus-
tralian ports to French trade, and ot “ boycotting”
the Messageries Maritimes steamers, is unworthy
of a man who poses as a statesman, and can only
bring ridicule upon the movement he is trying to
support. Such a thing could never be permitted
by t ither the English or French Governments. As
to the question Itself, you may rest quite assured
that the French will have the New Hebrides when-
ever they are required, in spite of all that the
Australian Convention may do ; and beyond per-
haps, a very mild protest, England will not at-
tempt to prevent it. The li-iendiy relations be-
tween the two countries are already shown
sufficiently by the Egyptian question, to say
nothing of the Madagascar business and other
little matters, to allow of any conflict about an
affair which in no way effects England directly.
The French are very touchy about the honour of
their country, and a check-mate, even In so small
a matter as the annexation of a few Islands in the
South Sea, might cause the downfall of the
Ministry. Unless I am misinformed, there is, at
the present moment, in New Caledonia, a gentle-
man who was sent out on a special mission in cot-
neotiou with this question, and who carries in his
pocket full authority to hoist the "tricolour”
upon any of the Islands. It the Australians wish
to be beforehand they must act without delay, and
induce the British Government to send a ship of
war to unfurl the Union Jack.

the proud privilege of paying the fees and charges
incidental to Albert Victor’s investiture as a
Knight of the Gartar. When the Duke of Cam-
bridge was created a Knight of the Thistle, about
two years ago, the country paid £341 for fees, and
at the same time £250 was paid for the charges on
Prince Leopold’s patents of creation to three
peerages. These are the little things that

her salon to have their paletots fitted. As they
have to wait their turn, small mats are placed on
the polished floor for them. These dogs, with their
precious mistresses, change their toilet according
to the time of day. Some wear dark-blue or red
cloth suits, with monograms on. Others have
sealskin paletots with handsome buttons, and
silver mountings on their fur collar. A pug dog
has been seen to be quite humiliated because he
was not dressed in the newest fashion. Which
shows that pug dogs and fashionable women are
very much alike....“I don’t care so much what

FAULTLESS FIRE BRIGADES AND
BLAMELESS BRASS BANDS.
Here it is from a Geelong paper, and in
the form of an advertisement: “ Letter of thanks.
I, the undersigned, beg to state that I am ,r ery
much pleased with tho manner in which the visi-
tors belonging to the following Are brigades and
band conducted themselves while staying in my
house: Beechworth No. 1 Fire Brigade, Kuther-
glen Fire Brigade, Border City Brass Band
(Albury).—A. Just, Pension Suisse, James-street.
This is what we have dreaded would happen for
years. It is apparently genuine, and the record of
a real experience. It is not “ evolved from the
depths of an internal consciousness,” and it shows
no sign of being produced as the price of personal
safety. No one can read the stately letter of M.
Just, and suppose that it was put together, bit by
bit, by the conjoined intellect of the two
fire brigades in question, and finally passed
through a third reading by the brass band,
before it was submitted for signature to the
trembling landlord of the Pension Suisse. No one
has any reason to think that tho brigades formed
a hollow oblong around the doomed man, with
levelled hose, while the bombardon commanded
him behind, and the saxhorns in front; while the
trombone at one earhole and the deadly eupho-
nium at the other, menaced him with the opening
bars of tho “Albury Schottische” if he showed
the least sign of hesitation. Nothing of that sort.
The conclusion is forced on the reader that they
did stay at M. Just’s hash academy, and acted,
while so staying, so much like ordinary people,
that ho recognised a phenomenal occurrence, and
heard a voice like that which came to John in
Patmos, saying “ Write.” Alas I Alas ! these new,
strange days of ours are levelling all things, and
even fire brigades and brass bands are losing their
individuality. We remember when things were
different. We were in a fire brigade once, and no
landlord voluntarily came forward to state that he
was pleased with the manner in which we con-
ducted ourselves. When wo offered to confer the
honour of our patronage on any hotel it was
always overcrowded—really had no room at all to
spare—but could recommend us to a good, quiet
place, &c., &c. And what struck us as peculiar
was that tho place recommended was generally
four miles away, and when we went there it was
too full and we were recommended to another place
four miles from it. But, when we once got into
any of these places, were their larders fatted with
fifty oxen our great revenge had stomachs for
them all. We loft desolate kitchens, pale,
hopeless, famine-pinched faces, and a tumult of
Elcked bones. Ah I those were the days. Wo wore
elmets and hose-practice medals, and swore
awfully, and strode abroad with the step
of Hannlbals, and made nurse girls who
happened to be orphans and minors ter-
remble. Eheu! We would have been captain,
too, but for a bandit called Mick Connelly. There
were strained relations between us and the other
fire brigade, and it was felt that the next fire must
decide who was to be boss. So we waited, and
waited, all through the long, sad summer, and at
last came our reward. A fire broke out in the
main street in mid-day. It had boon sworn that
whatever each member of our brigade was en-
gaged upon should be abandoned (even at the risk
of the sack from his employer) to make a big
muster at this, the deciding fire. When the bell
rang out its warning note, we flung the cleaver
down on the block, and rushed off in our blue,
blood - stained blouse to the scene of action.
Fortune favoured us. The other brigade—our
thrlce-acoursed enemies—had arrived first, and
were playing effectively on the burning
building. We fell upon them, with the fury
of a Chadean lion. We upended the engine
and chopped the hose into two-foot lengths ;
and when the Mayor, who was present, remon-
Strated. we buried the hatchet we always carry, in
its skull, and spurned his quivering carcase from
us with our foot. This deed was wildly applauded,
and our captainship was looked upon as a moral.
But then Mick Connelly of “ ours ” turned up and
wrested away our laurels. There was a long
ladder reared against the upper storey of the
flaming house, and on tho top rung of this the
captain of the other fellows appeared, bearing in
his arms a singed and half-dead Infant. Mick
promptly agitated the ladder at its base, and the
captain fell, a gory bulk of unrecognisable pulp,
at his feet. This was going one better than us, but
we gained on him a little by taking the child, which
yet breathed, and dashing its head in against the
wheel of a water-cart. We were about level again,
when Mick’s eye unfortunately fell upon the deaf
and dumb mother of the late Captain, standing at
her door across the way. To rush across, seize her in
his giant arms, hurry up tho ladder, and cast her
headlong into the flames, was the work of a
moment; and as ho came down among the people
again, the roar of voices that went up to the sun,
told us that wo were out of it. But these dear old
memories are apt to carry one away. We were
going to tell you something about this Border City
brass band, which has been singled out by M. Just
for immortality. We were at its inception—we
conceived the idea of its existence—wo nursed it
tenderly in its infancy—and we learn with pride
that it has left the colony and gone to Geelong. In
our days — when Luke Gulson wasn’t Mayor,
and not ono of tho family sported a stove-
pipe hat (we have too sincere a regard for his finer
feelings as a Mayor to say black tile we worked
in a brewery in Albury. It has been our fate for a
considerable part of our life to be Intimately con-
nected with the manufacture of the cup that
cheers, but, we are happy to say, does inebriate.
We wash the bottles and that sort of thing. Well,
our coadjutor (who used to scrape the tinfoil off
and wash the outsides) was musical, and had done
service at the horn of the Currawongboggalew
mail once a month. The waggoner had in his
youth been third emergency triangle to a fife and
drum band down Whitechapel way, and the cooper
could sing “Die Waoht am Rhein” standing on
his head. Added to this, we were literary and of
an interesting appearance, our boss was champion
compiex-double-aotion whistler of the universe,
the town drayman had a known ear—for blas-
phemy, and the cellarman could talk Latin,
nndwas supposed to bo good enough for anything.
Out of this crude material we formed the splendid
organization that has just surprised Just. Our
dart was to be treasurer. We called a meeting at
the dread hour of midnight, and attended at the
men a hut down tho yard, wearing masks, the
better to conceal our identity, for we had a great
dread lest the established band would offer us
money not to start, if we were known, Tho pro-
ceedings were opened by formally muzzling the
latin scholar, and appointing the German cooper
to take charge of a bucket of salt meat, that bit-
terly boiled for the morrow. Then we unfolded,
with infinite skill, the plan we had formed of
building up a musical syndicate to rake in all the
superfluous bullion for miles around. Then the
cellerman slipped his muzzle and said “syndicate ”
wasn t the word, and that it should be made a sine
qua non to have all our positions understood.
We pointed out to him, in the course of a
lucid and telling speech, that we didn’t want
any foreign yap, and that we’d blooming soon de-
fine his position in that there blooming meeting.
We also offered to belt the physiognomy off any-
body else who interfered. Having thus restored
confidence, we appointed ourself perpetual trea-
surer on the limited liability tack, gave the cymbals
to the waggoner on the strict understanding that
if ever a stern necessity compelled him to pawn
them, we were to be whacks, and allotted the other
instruments among the boys. The oellarman was
made secretary, and offered for the price of an
extra pint weekly; to keep the minutes in two
languages. That is the true story of the birth of
the Border City Band. Wei), it grew and grew, and
the brewery resounded with brazen notes; and as
the boss let all beginners have the run of their
little gullets in the cellar, the attendance was some-
thing big, and the band made for themselves a
name of fear the other bandsmen quaked to hear.
And, now that our back is turned, they have gone
and done tho thing we felt sure some band would
do some day—upset the good old traditions, and
acted in a way that pleased the admiral of a grub-
But it is true that precept is less power-
ful than example. And we have been away from
them for a year, VqM! *
AN ADAMANTINE CHEEK.
A wasp went buzzing to his work,
And various things did tackle;
He stung a boy and then a dog,
Then made a rooster cackle.
At last upon a lawyer's cheek
He settled down to drill;
He prodded there for half an hour,
And then he broke his bill.
Some men have a keen eye for business
even in the moment of direst adversity. Four
Melbourne gentlemen, for instance, at present on
remand upon a very serious charge of assault and
robbery, were taking one of their periodical rides
in “ Black Maria” when they remarked that one of
their fellow-travellers was rejoicing in a gold pin
and shirt-studs. And, like the busy bee, they im-
proved the shining hour. Ever anxious to be “ up
and doing,” they declined to rest from their labours
oven in the dim seclusion of a police van—in short,
they tripped up their unsuspecting comrade, and,
under cover of the gloom, relieved him of his
jewellery. We presume this will be described in
ithe police reports as a “ daring carriage robbery.”
The Hon. W. M. K. Yale, of Melbourne, is
an uncompromising Sabbatarian, a pillar of the
Church, and a most intemperate advocate of
teetotal principles. When filled to the chin with
ginger-beer and other exhilirating cordials, he
becomes eloquent, and when he mounts the
temperance platform, as he often does, he oca-
sionally gives utterance to unpleasant truths
During a late Impassioned address to the “cold-
water section ” of the Baptist Church, Melbourne,
he said that “he was sorry to find prominent
members of the Church, who did not disdain to
draw big pro Its from public-house property.”
Just so Mr, Vale. And we know numbers of them
also. Not only do they draw “big profits
from public-house property; ” but a good
Eroportion of these “prominent members” in
oth Melbourne and (Sydney, derive large in-
comes from the rent of bagnios. What a flutter
there would be emdbgat the “ best families ” of
St. Kilda, Toorak, Potts’ Point, and other fashion-
able localities, were a list of the brothels and
low whiskey-soiling dens and the owners thereof
published in both cities I Pb matters not to the
churches from what source the revenue necessary
for their support is derived, so long as it is forth-
coming. If old Satan were to donate a “fiver,”
the average church committee would record a
vote of thanks in his favour! The bilious-looking
Vale could have given many local instances in
support of his statement, had ho wished. Take,
for example, a principal shareholder of the
Melbourne Brewing and Malting Company, a
syndicate that owns a large per - centage of
the public-houses in and around Melbourne.
He is one of the “ pillars ” of St. Jude’s
Church of England, Carlton, to which he
recently donated a magnificent stained-glass win-
dow that throws a halo of dim religious light over
the Rev. C. S. Perry or his curate during Divine
service each Sunday. The same gentleman has
also built an asylum for over-worked Church of
England clergymen at Queensclifl (Vic.), where,
free from the worry of aggressive landladies,
they can enjoy the good things of this world,
and return, like giants refreshed, to wrestle
with Satan. The wherewithal to provide the luxu-
ries mentioned has been derived from the sale of
colonial beer, that cheerful baverage to which
clerics and tqjpperance spouters, with good reason,
perhaps, attribute much of the crime and suffer-
ing of the working classes. Which reminds us.
A few years back the Church of England, Moo-
roopna (Vic.), was languishing for funds. The
debt on the building was heavy, and the parson’s
salary was in arrear to such an extent that he
mildly but firmly intimated his Intention of going
“on strike,” What was to be done? Thanks-
giving services were a pronounced and unmiti-
gated failure—from a commercial point of view,
of course—and the most attractive tea-meetings,
even when the tables were presided over by the
poundkeeper’s missus, in conjunction with the
blacksmith’s daughter and the banker’s niece,
could not allure the ungodly bullock-drivers, or
profane ploughmen, from the fascinating influ-
ences of the female “barkeeps” of the town-
ships. But at length a happy thought struck
an enterprising deacon of the church. He sug-
gested that a fete champetre— whatever that may
be—should be got up on a scale of magnificence
fill at would concentrate the attention of the Just
and the unjust. A choice bit of Sylvan wood-
land was selected in a neighbouring selector’s
paddock,[as tho site for this al-fresco gathering, and
a series of games started, which would make the
promoters of Bartlemy fair green with envy. The
central attraction was a commodious liquor bar
where Mooroopna beer, supplemented by equally
unreliable whisky and colonial wine, was retailed
at current rates. The vendors of the liquors were
high-toned young ladies who ran the local Sunday
school, and seemed as much at home behind the
bar as when they expounded the scriptures
to the rising generation of Mooroopnians. The
aesthetic and ancient game of “cutting off
tho cock’s head,” but under the guise of a
Biblical name, was liberally patronised by the
young and lovely daughters of the clergyman from
tho adjacent township of Shepparton, who, amid
tho encouraging remarks of their ardent admirers,
the Bank clerks, made frantic though futile efforts
to decapitate the rooster with a broadsword. The
whoel-of-fortune, doodle-’em-buck, the three-card
trick, and other games of skill were in full swing,
and in expert hands proved very remunerative,
the majority of the luck being on the Board’s side.
The local brass band made things hum in the
musical way, until the blacksmith, who belted the
big ;drum,! got disguised in liquor, and went to
“ put a head ” on tho butcher’s assistant for giddy
behaviour towards his (the blacksmith’s) best girl
whilst engaged in the congenial amusement of
kiss-in-the-ring, and [the parties had to adjourn
behind a clump of bushes to settle the matter in
the Miller-Foley style. With the exception of that
trifling incident, nothing of a serious nature oc-
curred to disturb the harmony of the proceedings,
the [highest of hivh-jinks were carried on, and a
rightjgood ti me was the result. When the accounts
were balanced, a tidy sum was placed to the credit
of the church, the threatened strike of tho parson
was averted, and the overdraft on the church pro-
perty considerably reduced. The deason to whom
the credit of the affair was due, was ajevel-hoaded
man, who had an accurate grasp of the capacity of
Mooroopnians for “wholesome fun” atod mixed
liquors. The foregoing anecdote goes to prove
something, but we forget what it is jest now
Sowever, if we should happen to disagree with
r. Vale on the teetotal question, we ban him as a
step-brother when he alludes to the sources from
which the Church draws a good share of its in-
come.
An Emusing Experiment.
The Port Douglas correspondent of the Brisbane Courier writes A rather interesting experiment in natural history is being tried by ono
of our local bank managers. He sent several eggs of the alligator (or more properly gavial) to the Sydney Acclimatisation Society to be hatched
and reared.”
The Emu in the Botanical Gardens, having nothing else to do, was
entrusted with the job of hatching out the lot.
All died in infancy, save one, who grew to be the apple of the
Emu’s eye, and she watched him develope from day to day with
a mother’s honest pride.
! At last, when the great undertaking was accomplished, “ Well, you arc a
rum lot of chickens,” remarked the adopted parent.
One day, just as she was beginning
to look forward to bis being tbe sup-
port and solace of her declining years,
“ Mother,” he said, with sudden vehe-
mencg, “it occurs to me that I never
saw you swim, do come and try/ 7
And now, an aged and infirm
Emu (with a wooden leg), in the
intervals of culling buttons from
passers-by, bewails her fate, and
quotes Shakespeare’s celebrated
lines about how “ sharper than a
serpent’s tooth it is,” &e.

Rev. Father Wilds’
EXPERIENCE,
The Rev. T. P. Wilds, well-known city
missionary in New York, and brother
of the late eminent Judge Wilds, of the
Massachusetts Supreme Court, writes
as follows:
“ 78 E. 54th St., New York, May 16,1882.
Messrs, -I. C. Ayer & Co., Gentlemen :
Last winter I was troubled with a most
uncomfortable itching humor affecting
more especially my limbs, which itched so
intolerably at night, and burned so intense-
ly, that 1 could scarcely bear any clothing
over them. I was also a sufferer from a
severe catarrh and catarrhal cough; my
appetite was poor, and my system a good
deal run down. Knowing the value of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, by observation of
many other cases, and from personal use
in former years, I began taking it f°r ?ho
above-named disorders. My appetite im-
proved almost from the first dose. Alter
a short time the fever and itching wore
allayed, and all signs of irritation of the
skin disappeared. My catarrh and cough
wore also cured by the same means, and
my general health greatly improved, until
it is now excellent. 1 feel a hundred per
cent stronger, and I attribute these results
to the use of the Sarsaparilla, which
1 recommend with all confidence as the
best blood medicine ever devised. I took
it in small doses three times a day, and
used, in all, less than two bottles. I place
these facts at your service, hoping then-
publication may do good. __ TTTia „
Yours respectfully, Z. P. M ilds.
The above instance is but one of the many
constantly coining to our notice, which prove
the perfect adaptability of Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla to the cure of all diseases arising
from Impure or Impoverished bleed, and a
weakened vitality.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
cleanses, enriches, and strengthens the blood,
stimulates the action of the stomach and
bowels, and thereby enables the system to
resist and overcome the attacks of all Sorcfur
hug Diseases, Eruptions of the Skin, Rheu-
matism, Catarrh, General Debility, and all
disorders resulting from poor or corrupted
blood and a low state of tbe system.

DANIEL And the LIONS.
LATEST VERSION.
“Beloved Brethren,” began the frebkle-
nosed newsboy as he mounted a soft good s box
in a right-of-way and gathered his comrades
about him, “ I doesn’t like to call ye benlted
heathen wot never goes to church brethern, (
but I win out to the Salvation Harmy las nlte an
I wants to tell ye wot I burred. There was a cove
there wr.t tha calls capting an’ he got up in front
an’ pitched away for about two hours. He
tole us all about Danisl in the lion s den wpt is
somewhere over in a heathen country where your
people must’a' emigrated from. Dan was a Jew
cove wot knowed everythink. Won he was a boy
he never swored, never played fatty norpitch-un -
toss nor nothink. Wun nite wen he was asleep
ho burred the angels callen’ him an he thot it
was his mother singin’ out to him to git up an
milk the cow an’ chop some wood fur to get
breakfast; but afterwuds he found out that the
Lorrud wanted him for another dart, so he
hired out to the Lorrud and dinged the milkln.
Wen he growd up he got his bed chock full of
ijeas cos he subscribed fur the Buduet in. After
a while the Jews had a flto with the heathen an
Dan he was tooken prisoner an' carried away into
a strange land where tha didn’t know nothmk
about God nor General Booth. Dan s muther
was a good woman an’ wen ho wos a boy she tol
him to say ‘ His Daily Bread’ an’ ‘now I lay me, so
wen he got amongst the heathen he ust alius to git
down on his nees an’ pitch away from midmte till
the sun got up in tne mornln’. Purty soon the
King of the heathen he found out wot Dan wasn t
no duffer an’ he made him Jlne his ministry.
That wos the place for Dan an’ afore long he got
his work in on the King so well that the King wos
sorry he hadn’t no grown-up daughter to marry
him to. The other blokes in the ministry tha
seed wot wos goin’ on an’ tha got jellus of
Dan. Tha found out that wen Dan prayed
he alius opened the window and looked toward the
yeast. So tha went to the king unbeknowmst to
Dan, an’ got him to pass a law that no man should
pray with nis face towards the yeast. The king
made the law, not thinkia’ about Dan. an’so the
next time Dan went to pray, the other coves had
him summoned for violatin’ the law. The “leg
was sorry enuff to bite his own had off, but he
couldn’t help his-selt, cos the laws of the heathen
never changed. But ho tole Dan that ef he would
say he was sorry an’ wouldn’t do It no more he d
let him orf this time; but Dan he said he wasn t
sorry, an’ would do It agin wenever he felt like it.
So the other blokes tha made the king pitch Dan
into the Lions’ den, were tha was about 40 hungry
hanimals awaitin' fur ther breakfast. Of course
the king an’ the other coves thought that Dan was
a gone mackeral that time, but he wussunt. The
Lions gathered around him an’ began to smell,
an’ wen tha found out hej was a Jew, tha Jist
turned up their nose an’ went away to the back
end of the cave. So Dan he rapt his blanket about
him an’ camped for the nite with a stone for his
pillar. Ho know that wen mornink kirn the king
would be down to gather up his watch an’ rings
an’ shirt-studs, an’ any other valuables wat the
hungry Hons mite have left av him. When daylite
kim, sure enuff the king rapt at the door, an he
sung out “ Dan-i-U” loud as lie could holler. But
Dan he played possum, an’ the king called an
called, an’ called, agin and agin, and agin, until he
was gittin’ the Brownkiltys, and thin Dan he says:
“ Wot in thunder do you want, amakin’ of all that
noise so airly in the mornink, wen a feller wants to
sleep T” Wen the king burred this, ho wos tickled
mos to deth, an’ he opened the door an let Dan
out. Then thashuk bans and went over to the pub
across the street, were tha had two half-mints an
some bisklts an’ cheese, ’cos Dan was awful holler
inside from fastin’. Then the king wanted to find
out why the lions hadn’t eat Dan, an’ Dan tole him
he’d tell if the king would toss them other coves,
wot were enemies of hlsn, into the den, and let
him form a new Ministry. The king agreed to
this, *n’ so they was chucked in hed first, an the
lions swallerod ’em whole without chewln . When
It kim time for Dan to tell the King how he kep
the lions orf, Dan he Jes’ put his thumb up to his
nose an’ wiggled his fingers like this, an the king
crawled awav and died. My brethren, there is a
moral to this sermon, which is, wen you tells a lie,
tell a good wun, or it won’t be believed. Now, we
will pass the hat, after which wo will all Jlne in
Bingin’“Trim yer lamps, an’ be reddy fur the mld-
nite call.” Then ye kin break ranks, an’ go forra-
gin’for customers. Knit! Here comes a bobby,
and the meeting disbanded forthwith.
The Harmy gave Major Thurman and his
bride a “ Monster Demonstration ” on arriving
from England, in Adelaide. It seems that the
most prominent members in the procession were
“ Bishop Kennion,” (I) theKev. F. Williams. (I )
and “a converted burglar from Melbourne (I I I).
The latter was evidently, however, the leading
“star ” for we are told that he "was duly wept
over by the entire mob.” Bundey, Mayor of
Adelaide, occupied the chair at the town Hall, and
“ B hot the devil” with as much precision as though
he were going for an obstreperous town clerk, or
the “ paime cut ” at a civic feed.
Some mild amusement was afforded lately
to the over-worked clerks in an office in George-
street by the antics of a Hibernian who was carry-
ing on telephonic correspondence with a man at
Circular Quay. AU the time he was listening, he
kept a sidelong glance fixed on the receiver, as if
expecting each moment to see it open and shut.
At times he became wildly excited, and it was
evident the blood of a dozen O’Flams was boiling
in his veins. At length, as he turned away, after
listening in vain for a reply to bis last question,
‘‘Skure, an’ if he’d jist repated that, he burst out,
44 1 wud a-knocked tho hull blanstod masheen
down his Ivin’ throat 1 ”
A considerable number of public school
teachers, we are sorry to report, are in a most
boneless state of mental collapse brought on by
their having recklessly endeavoured to analyse
the fourth sentence of the leading article of a late
number of the Echo. This cunningly contrived
nar reads as follows: ‘‘The latter (the rising God.
as opposed to the crucified Christ) is the perpetual
resurrection from the grave of that fate which
dav by day and hour by hour we see no loss than
wo hope in the life upon life that shall follow death
after death * e hope to see.” To the Echo scribe
we would tender the hackneyed advice:-
“ See that your style be brief, your meaning clear,
Nor, as your wont is. tire the labouring oar
With a wild waste of words—sound without sense,
And all the florid glare of impotence.”
Thus Maxwell There is no chance for
pettifoggers—the banditti of the bar. Poor, or
Sch, or stupid clients cannot be deluded, nor
udge nor Jury mystified by tho skill of sharp
practitioners in tho courts of law in Norway. The
udKts of the Norwegian courts are responsible
for errors of Judgment, delay, ignorance, carless-
nees, partiality, or prejudice. They may be sum-
moned, accused, and tried in the superior court,
and if convicted, are liable to damages to the
party injured. There are. therefore, very few
unworthy lawyers in the Norwegian courts. The
Bench and Bar are distinguished for integrity and
earning. They have great influence in the com-
munity; and the country appreciates the many
benefits which have resulted from their virtue and
their wisdom.” Can’t you see ? Of course you can.
The disguise is too transparent. ’Tis of N.b. Wales
he is speaking all the time, lor shame, Maxwell,
to try and mislead us like this.
Mr. W. G. Marsh, Secretary of the Young
Men’s Christian Association of Victoria, has been
on the war path. Mr. W. G. M., it appeal s, has
been lecturing at Wellington, New Zealand, on
“ vice” in general, and its prevalence in Aus-
tralia. in particular. He quite horrified his
Wellington audience by telling them Of a banquet
held in Australia to celebrate the one hundredth
seduction achieved by a member of the legisla-
ture ” and the New Zealanders smiled sadly at one
another as they thought of the wickedness of
Australians, and thanked Heaven that they were
not as other men were. Subsequently Mr. Marsh
wm “ interviewed,” and the Christian gentleman
admitted that he was not quite certain whether
Don Juan was a number of the Legislature (or
Australia) or whether, as a matter of fact, he ex-
isted at all. We think we can put Mr. M. right on
the first point. No Australian legislator is smart
enough to accomplish such a feat as a hun , oh,
it’s quite out of the question.
Quebec is a somewhat chilly city in the
winter, and, not caring much about having to face
the fast-approaching frosts, he thought he might
as well take advantage of an offer to "‘run oyer
to Liverpool as a green hand in one of the sailing
packets. He had heard of these western ocean
liners, with their crews of “packet-rats, half-
seamen, half-loafers, with a dash of ankee-
bully thrown in, and he was mightily concerned
about the safety of the thirty golden sovereigns
which composed his entire store. However, he
chanced it. Hut, somehow, the fact that he was
“flush” had got wind, and in the middle watches
of the dreary Atlantic nights, cautious hands
would stealthily examine his clothes, the lining of
his boots, the contents of his “round-bottomed
chest ” even the very seams of his sou’-wester, but
all to no purpose. The green one calmly pursued
his way, apparently unconscious of the intense
interest with which he was regarded by the non-
plussed ‘Tats.” At length the old Dreadnought
muled into the Nelson dock and made fast, while
the verdant “runner,” seeing everything clear for
a start, quietly took down an old halt-used bar or
soap, which had lain on a little shelf at the head of
his bunk the whole passage, and, calmly breaking
it in half, and exposing the golden store, so unre-
mittingly sought for, he remarked—“ Well, mat®?’
I’m sorry you’ve ’ad so much trouble about this

Britons who read this will please observe
that when we say “ B.” Ribbon that Initial letter is
put there for shortness and stands for “ Blue’ —
not the other at all. Well, here is how the B.
RibPon party work the orac’o. They rent a hall
to grind gospel-tern peranee in. The figure charged
is, say, fora fortnight’s rent, £200. Well, that is
told night after night from the platform. Surely
everyone should help to pay the rent. If every-
body doesn’t there will be a direct appeal and a
personal canvass merely and solely to meet that
necessary expens°. The couple of apostles pro-
cess to want nothing for themselves. It will bo
1 desperately hard lines if this item of rent be net
responded to. Well, it is, or has been at least
hitherto, responded to so as even to crowd a little
over the edge of the plate. Then the Mission is
wound up, and the theatre, or the Exhibition
building, or whatever the ball was, is vacated.
Next day a deputation from the apostles waits
upon the committee of the hall, and points out
that, although the terms of agreement were for
£200, yet as the object was of a public and charit-
able hind, only half rates, at the utmost, should be
Insisted on. By this time the apostles have
got into the graces of some members of
the hall-committee, and iol a resolution Is
passed accepting £100, or sometimes £o0, as pay-
ment in full. And then the apostles meet, rub
their hands, and divide the surplus. And there
are many other “necessary” expenses incurred
and liquidated in the same way. Now the apostles
havo not asked, directly, any contribution lor
their own use. They have simply placarded the
amount of the “ necessary expenses,’ as totted up
at the opening of the Mission, have urged people
to reach out to these alone, and then gone round
when they had the haul in, and got tbe contrac-
tors to reduce the tenders 50 or 75 per cent., and
have collared the balance. They have just bad
a row about it in the local council at Richmond.
Councillor Farmer maintained “the apostles were
making a good living out of the nuisance and
insisted on first prices being stuck to. Buthe was
outvoted and the rent was reduced one-half. It
was, no doubt, an oversight on the part or the
apostles, or they would have tried to make close
friends ” with Councillor Farmer before the point
came up. After this it is clear the B. Ribbonists
can do a double-shuffle with their heads if not
with their heels ?
For spicy reading, there’s nothing sur-
passes the properly worked-up account of a prison
" flogging. Divorce cases are interesting enough
in their way, and murders are not bad, but, lor
blood-curdling details, “flagellations” certainly
bear off the palm. The Melbourne Herald has
been giving an uncommonly lively description of
“A Triple Flogging at Fentridge’’-three cat
episodes in one day being calculated to awake the
eloquence of any reporter, Upjohn s first cus-
tomer, it appears, “ suffered severely, but re-
fused to have a cold wet rag put un bis back,
observing ‘That’s apt to give a man cold.
Whether those remarkable words are qu aed as
an example of the man's bravado, or merely as a
medical hint for future culprits, is not quite clear
-but no matter. Th« second gentlema- to take
un hia position at the triangles was troubled with
a blister on the side ; so “ Upjohn was directed not
to strike near the place.” That functionary must
have selected some other place that was pretty
susceptible, though, because " whikt undergoing
his punishment tbe prisoner stared at Upjohn the
whole time, and bit his left arm." Here, again,
there’s a certain amount of haziness, for wo can t
quite make out whose arm was bitten—but
perhaps that invests the item with an adduional
charm. And now comes a real literary bonne-
bouche. Flogging number three, you must kno w,
was a pleasing variety from its predecessors, being
administered to an Arab; and, as it isn’t everyday
of the week that one can see a “ darkie” lacerated,
the Herald man gives a little space to this case.
Ho tells us how, "on the darkie taking off his shirt,
it was evident that he laid on a former occasion
received a very severe flogging from something
more severe than the Fentridge cat.” After read-
ing that opinion—and the Herald man is a con-
noisseur in these things-we are surprised to find
that previous experience made very little differ-
ence to the poor darkie's back on the present
occasion, for “ at every stroke Abdallah roared
lustily ‘ Oh, Moggara! ’ and his dusky skin at the
conclusion of the punishment presented the appear-
ance of having been chalk-marked, the small knots
of the cat being distinctly shown. There! We
told you we had a dainty morsel for the finish, and
you must admit that the bit about the dusky flesh
becoming “ chalk-marked” is really appetising:
it’s instructive, moreover—scientifically instruc-
tive, By the bye, we’re not favoured with an
English translation of “Oh, Moggara, but, judg-
ing from circumstances, we should think it was
uncommonly like swearing.
The Jerseyites, although in general a stolid,
matter-of-fact set, have, or years ago had, their
standard joke which they periodically played on: on
thenew comers to the tight little island ot cows and
cabbage-stalks, conger-eels and new potatoes.
They played it off on us in this wise, and thus, as
will be seen, furnished us with the material for an
eminently readable reminiscence, of long ago.
“ Was there,” we asked, “ any shooting to be had
in the island?” “But yes I why not,’ answered
our Norman-Jersey host of the Hotel Kollo, bt.
Aubins Koad, “ at St Brelades (the whole place is
alive with saints) do rabbits much JJpound, there
will Monsieur enjoy the sport.” Elated at this,
we borrowed a flre-arm, which by its appearance
might have served His most gracious Majesty
Charles II, to shoot gulls with out of the windows
©f Gorey Castle, and a largo canvas bag for the
game. Thus equipped wo started. Passing through
the little village of St. Aubins, just as a good
sized vessel was being launched from Hayley s
ship-yard, we, along with some score or so of
people who scanned our turn-out attentively, then
smiled gently at each other, paused to look on. I he
vessel-was ot about TOO tons burthen, and for a
figure-head bore a grim-looking warrior in tartan
plaid and coat of mail. The ceremony of christen-
ing 1 was being 1 performed by a, If anything, plain-
looking young girl, who cut the string, and, as the
bottle smashed against the bows, named the ship
The Scottish Chief. ,, Tan, tap, tap, and down the
greasy ways she sped smoothly enough into deep
water. Not a cheer or shout from the unimpres-
sionable Islanders heralded the successful launch;
but the girl took off her wide-brimmed straw hat
and waved .it round her head with a shrill “ Kah.
We were slightly acquainted with both the child—
for she was little more—and the tall soldiery-look-
ing cleric by her side, and perhaps, had we imagined
that in the far future Miss. Le Breton would blossom
into fame and beauty as the “Jersey Lily,” we
might have stayed and improved upon a first in-
troduction. But our mind was with the rabbits,
and we walked away, leaving the Mrs. Langtry to
be standing on a big spar, and pointing outani-
raatedly to her pa. the glittering cuirass of the
warrior as it shone in the midday sun. Mais
revenons d nos lapins. Well—you can’t write a I
gossipy par. like this without a lot of ’em—we got
to S. Breladcs in good time, and were welcomed
as an old friend by the inhabitants, who
asked us what the bag was for, with the
-same gentle smile we had noticed before.
“To put our rabbits in, of course,” we boldly
answered. Whereupon, the ancient dames, with
tall snowy caps, smiled more placidly than ever,
and muttered something in a curious patois that
we couldn’t quite make out. However, we
every gorse-bush on the cliffs, and the hanging
woods round the bay for the rest of the day, and
deuce a rabbit, or a hair of a rabbit, or, in fact,
anything else but green lizards, did we see, so,
tired out and savage, we at length chartered a
tously-headcd little Brelader to carry our Brown
Bess, and made tracks. On our way home, the
imp informed us, with scarcely-repressed glee,
that there was but one solitary rabbit on the
whole island, and that he, however, lived at S. Bre-
lades. right enough, was of an immense age, was
visible only ones or twice in the year, and was, in
tact, expecting canonisation, which he well de-
served. owing to a miraculous faculty hepossessed
of drawing strangers to S. Brelades. Not so bad
this, from a little savage, who spoke pigeon French,
was it? We never went rabbit-shooting again in
Jersey, and we’ve never seen the “Lily” since;
but many years afterwards we met the Scottish
Chief snugly ashore in a secluded cove in Magel-
lan’s Straits, whcre.wb h other wreckage, she helped
to form a building, used at times as a sealing-camp
and refuge, and as we gazed at her battered and
dinted panoply, we wondered greatly where she’d
been through all those long years, and whether her
gentle baptizer ever gave a thought to the day
when, in girlish glee, she cheered her into old
ocean’s arms.
