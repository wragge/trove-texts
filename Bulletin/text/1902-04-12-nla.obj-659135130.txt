THE RED PAGE .
Behold! in those lines you have the lovely gliding which
only poetry in perfection and crystal waters knows.
Daley’s atmosphere is one of dream, his theme 'love.
Autumnal sentiment and gentle regret shade his work
with a beautiful sadness.
His work affects the mind like slanted sunshine after
rain, when all the roses weep. There is much of Swin-
burne’s intense colour in many of his verses, but little of
that poet’s tropic passion. Love with Daley is a delicate
sentiment, a something remote and pensive, a marble
statue touched and softened by the quiet glory
that reaches it through painted windows. There is
nothing coarse or fleshly or redly sensual in him. His
message is not to the animal, but to the soul; not to the
hot heart of the Present, choked with thick desire and
all in flame with passion, but to the slow heart of the
Past, where glimmers a faint love whitened over by
ashes. . .
My dream flies after him, and I
Am in another land ;
The sun sets in another sky,
And we sit hand in hand.
Grey eyes look into mine; such eyes
X think the angels’ are:
Soft a 3 the soft light in the skies
When shines the morning star;
And tremulous as mom, when thin
Gold lights begin to glow,
Revealing the bright soul within
As dawn the sun below.
He can be simple as milk, too, and sing heart-songs with
the best of them. “The Old Wife and the New” is a
tender ballad, sad with youth’s decay and love's decease,
and memories of surrendered power. . .
He sat beneath the curling vines
That round the gay verandah twined,
His forehead seamed with sorrow’s lines,
An old man with a weary mind.
His young wife, with a rosy face,
And brown arm 3, ambered by the sun,
Went flitting all about the place—
Master and mistress, both in one.
The old man bent his weary head ;
The sunlight on his grey hair shone •
His thoughts were with a woman dead
And buried, years and years agone.
The quiet loveliness of lines like these gravely insists on a
place in our memory. “The Old Wife and the New”
has some slight local colour :
Where once were gum-trees gaunt and stark
And blood-woods waved green-feathered foam.
But in other places Daley is not so happy in the use of it.
Although his sunset gallery i 3 purely Australian, and
perfect as may be, he is not successful when dealing with
the human side of our new life. His mind was cast in an
ancient mould, and the Now and Here are too fresh and
crude to inspire his best. The Romantic and the Uni-
versal were appointed as his domain, and he robs his gift
of voice when he descends to the Real and the Near.
Am I too venturesome in believing that the poet is a
present embodiment of all the experience that greeted
his forbears through all time ? Perhaps I am, but some-
times I fancy that Daley is a descendant of inland
dwellers who lived in a green calm, flowered about by
many a fairy tradition, breathing mild airs, and seldom
hearing the storm that shouted on a far' coast. This,
perhaps, is the reason why he is a lover of Nature in her
tranquil moods—river reaches, smooth as green glass—
mirrored trees, and seas enchanted by sunset. He lacks
the storm-note. To stricken seas and tortured forests he
is deaf ; and still he has an ear for the eerie and the
strange, the hiss of yeast on driven waves, and the sound
of voices wailing death. . .
Night winds soughing through grave-yard trees,
And wild winds ploughing the wild, salt seas—
These are my lovers, and only these. . .
In passing, it is a duty to remark that the omission from
At Dawn and Dusk of the poem to which these lines
belong is a deadly sin.
Daley’s songs must reside in our memory by the double
title of their sweet music and the pure insistence of their
imagery. As the child, of ancient Ireland he is heir to
her wine-dark legends. The fantastic beauty of twilight
times, when that country was a theatre wherein hero-
shapes moved as in a cloud, has descended through the
dark to him, and gilds his soul as a dusty sunbeam finds
a gem and is made manifest by its discovery. It does not
need deep analysis to arrive at a conclusion as to the
effect of At Dawn and Dusk upon Australian verse.
Daley has shown us how to sing in faultless tone, and
though our voices may crack in the attempt to follow
him, the literature of our country will be the richer
because of the effort. To oonclude, Daley is not a great
original poet; the day of the great Originals seems
done, and it is hardly likely that a school will be founded
upon him. He does not desire it. As a preacher of the
Beautiful he has brought loveliness into many a mind,
and his songs are so delicious that it seems deeply un-
familiar to find oneself writing of him in the present
tense. He is great enough to belong to the Past; and it
is surely high time that he quitted the shadow of the
sail, wherein he so long dwelt, to stand at last in the sun-
set glow.
* -
One does not understand the final expression
of opinion that Daley would be better out of the
way; or, rather, ono can only understand it by
light of that anecdote printed in a Melbourne
paper (denied). The Villains alleged that,
when poet Ogilvie left Australia, Quinn met
Daley at a prayer-meeting (denied) ; and
quoth Quinn (denied), “Well, Victor, there’s
only me and you for it now ” (denied).
’Tis a pity the anecdote is (denied), for
the idea that Australia has only a certain amount
of poetic credit for sharing, and that it is time
Daley stopped sharing, has many interesting
facets.
* * * * *
Daley, alas ! has been in very bad health lately:
he is getting on in years, and has tasted to the full
(with admixtures)
. . . the lot austere
That waits upon the man of letters here
and his friends are just now combining in an effort
to send him on a sea-voyage, and bring him back
with (not a sunset, but) a sunrise glow. There is
to be an entertainment, with musical and pictorial
trimmings; and many admirers of the poet have
come forward with financial help. Those who
care enough and can spare a little may, if they
choose, add to the fund at this office.
■
And, speak of the poet .. . ! As we are
writing, comes to hand a collection of “ Songs for
the Buccleuch Hunt ” made by Will Ogilvie—the
wanderer who, returned to his Scottish home,
continues to ride gray horses (with a pedigree) in
chase of fair girls (with a brogue). And foxes in-
cidentally. Ogilvie’s rhymes are really spirited :
in fact, they .challenge comparison with Whyte-
Melville, and fail only by a pulse-beat or sd. But
Ogilvie is a light-weight: Whyte-Melville surely
could not have ridden less than eleven stone. A
two-or-three for tasting—
And the gallop and the kill—
Oh ! it’s home t
Hacking home, where the mists are spread like foam,
When the world will soon be snoring, and the dew‘s a
silver flooring
For the dance of elf and gnome,
It’s a weird ride, hacking home !
But you ’re picking up the landmarks, and in half-an-hour
or less,
You are crunching over gravel where the fir-boughs curl
and comb,
And, for all so keen a rider, you are willing to confess
That you *re glad to be at home !
Landed home !
Safe at home, and mud-bespattered, splashed with foam 1
And the old horse slips on gravel and you lift him on the
snaffle,
And across the starry dome
Loom the gable roofs of home !
YOUNG DEMOCRACY
Hark! Young Democracy from sleep
Our careless sentries raps ;
A backwash from the Future’s deep
Our cliffs of Evil saps.
Unknown, these Titans of our Night
Their New Creation make :
Unseen, they toil and love and fight
That hocussed Man may wake.
Knights-errant of the human race,
The Quixotes of to-day,
For man as man they claim a place,
Prepare the tedious way.
They seek no dim-eyed mob’s applause,
Deem base the titled name,
And jilt, for glory of their Cause,
The tawdry nymphs of Fame.
No masks of ignorance or sin
Hide from them you or me:
We ’re Man, no colour shames our skin,
No race or cast have we.
The prognathous Neanderthal, •
To them, conceals the Bruce ;
They see Dan ffSsop in the Thrall |
From swagmen Christ deduce.
Tho’ butt for lecher’s ribaldry
And scarred by woman’s scorn,
In baby-burdened girl they see
God-motherhood, forlorn.
With them to racial siredom glides
The savage we’d deprave ;
That eunuch brilliant Narses hides,
A Spartacus, that slave.
They Ohristhood find in manger waif;
In horse-boys Shakespearhood :
And earthquake-Luthers nestling safe
In German miner’s brood.
The God that pulses everywhere
They know fill! Satan’s veins ;
No felon but they see Him there
Behind His mirror’s stains.
•Tis theirs Earth’s charnel rooms to clear.
And ruthless sweep away
The Lares and Penates dear
To man in his decay.
Their restless energy collects
Devices to disturb
The keeps whence feudal architects
Our free banditti curb.
Their unrelenting wars they wage,
These Furies of the Right,
Where myriad Falsehood’s legions rage,
Artilleried by Might;
Where Fashion’s stupid iron clamps
Young Innovation’s head;
And Law the robust Present cramps
In Past’s Procrustes-bed ;
Where Pride of learning, substance, blood.
Or prowess in the strife,
, Exacts from teeming lowlihood
The lion’s share of life ;
Where Gluttony would to the brutes
Degrade his loose-lipped gangs ;
Where Tyranny his venom shoots
From one or million fang :
Where Cruelty, in Wisdom’s mask,
Piths fame from agonies ;
Where blessed is racial Murder’s task
By priests of Gods of Peace.
In Punic or in Persian fray
With Love’s and Conscience’ foes,
Unadvertising Romans they,
And Spartans free from pose.
Abused as mad or traitors by
The harpies they’d eject;
Cold-shouldered by wan Apathy;
Ofsmotives mean suspect;
Out cast from social jollities ;
Denied life’s lilied grace ;
They mount their hidden Calvaries
To save the human race.
Some sweat within the factory.
Some languish in “ high ” place,—
Some serve the “ low,” and some the “ high,"
But most are in disgrace.
But whether in the mob or school.
In church or poverty,
They teach and live the Golden Rule
Of Young Democracy : —
“ To each whatc’er all can bestow —
That colour, caste's a lie —
That Man is God, however low —
Is man , however high. ”
v.
DANTON.
Roderic Quinn lauds Victor Daley’s verse—
The poets of the past live in the language of to-day.
It is their best habitation. So it follows that their songs
are sometimes sung twice over. There is nothing new
under the sun, and that is why the present-day singer
must content himself with saying old things newly.
However much he tries to be original, some hand from
©ut the past is always at his elbow, guiding his fingers as
they write. . Then he is charged with being reminiscent,
a pigmy striding in the footprints of a giant. All the
poet-gold was minted long ago, yet the poet-impulse to
pour golden coin upon the world survives, and the
only thing to do is to melt the money down, each in his
own crucible, and re-mint it. The Masters wrought
so well, however, that no matter how the imprint be
changed Georgius Rex will often show himself through
Victoria Regina. All this has very little to do with
Daley; he would scorn to borrow from any
man ; but here and there in At Dawn and Dtisk we
catch a glimpse of Rossetti. Sometimes, when I am
reading Daley, I remember Rossetti. In part, the
reminiscence exists through the kinship of pure beauty,
a gem recalling a gem—a star suggesting a star. For the
rest, he is like Rossetti because he is a true artist, con-
trolling his genius with the silken reins of Art, and never
permitting it to take head and get away with him. He
never soars out of sight or dives too deeply. The artist
governs the poet, and the poem must please them both,
else Daley himself will not be satisfied. Under this keen
censorship, every word is judiciously said, every image
happily set, and the whole meaning clear as in a mirror.
In At Dawn and Dusk all the figures are flooded with
tender light, melancholy perhaps, yet clear-cut as though
they were done in ivory. We find no Rembrandt faces
there, half shadow and half light, and this because Daley
is a poet of Statement rather than of Suggestion.
The faculty that enables him to control his inspiration
dowers him in another way. He does not soar too high,
but he soars always. Or to say it in different wise : his
path is that of sustained beauty winding always
among roses, and never deviating into a barren
waste of weeds. Perhaps his richest canvas is
the “ Two Sunsets,” and there he pursues the
painted tenor of .his way, evenly, but never monoton-
ously—gliding on from line to line and colour to colour
with delicious grace and invisible blending. . .
All things beneath the still sky seem
Bound by the spell of a sweet dream ;
In the dusk forest, dreamingly,
Droops slowly down each plumfed head;
The river flowing softly by
Dreams of the sea ; the quiet sea
Dreams of the unseen stars : and I
Am dreaming of the dreamless dead.
TO HORSE AND AWAY!
When sorrows come sobbing
To clutch at the breast,
When trouble comes robbing
The heart of its rest,
When cash-columns addle
The brain as they may :
Swing into the saddle,
To horse and away 1
To horse and away
To the heart of the fray !
Fling care to the Devil for one merry day 1
When tradesmen importurie,
When duns make advance,
When fickle Dame Fortune
Is frowning askance,
When Love’s looking lonely
And Life’s looking gray,
There’s one solace only—
To horse and away 1
To horse and away,
With spurs in the bay !
Ming Care to perdition for one merry day !
Behind each gay rider
Sits Care, we are told,
With dark hair to hide her
And clinging hands cold ;
If swift we be flying
Oare cannot but sway
And fall ! Leave her lying 1
To horse and away !
To horse and away !
Where she fell let her stay !
Hark for’ard ! And leave her—Oare dead for a day !
GET AWAY ON!
A stir at the end of the cover,
A hat in a hand for a sign,
And music to tell to the rover
Shore’s* beauties are out on his line 1
See ! from the corner a dog-fox has gone!
Get away on to him ! Get away on!
A rattle, a rush for your places,
A struggle to get to the gate !
Then show them the best of your paces
And toss for a panel with Fate !
Give him his head at the beat of your heart!
Half of the triumph is won at the start!
Oh ! hark to the rap and the rattle,
The thud of the rails going down !
And right in the front of the battle
A crash, and a riderless brown !
He will be cornered and mounted anon ;
Get away on to him ! Get away on 1
They ’re Streaming away in the stubble,
They ’re racing like birds on the grass,
The shirker’s already in trouble
And letting the better men pass !
Your heart is a-throb at the tug of the reins
And the music sets spinning the blood in your veins!
Since never a day is too long, man,
And never a gallop too fast, .
Let’s jump while we ’re still going strong, man,
And pace it as long as we last!
Soon from the field we ’ll be gathered and gone—
Get away on to him ! Get away on 1
HACKING HOME!
When they’ve broken up a good one after “ something
like a run,”
Or they've dropped him in the turnips, or run past him
in the fern ;
When a golden glow to westward gives a hint of setting
sun.
And it’s time for you to turn—
Then it’s home !
Hacking home, when the mists are on the loam !
When the night is gathering dreary, and the old horse,
game but weary,
Tosses back the flecks of foam,
It’s a long ride hacking home!
When the mud of mid-November gathers spotted on the
girth,
When the little roadway puddles lie a-gleaming to the
stars,
When the gusty winds are whirling all the dead leaves of
the earth
Round your chilly stirrup bars—
Oh ! it’s home !
Hacking home, when the mists are on the loam !
When the icy dews are falling, and the lonely night-birds
calling,
And the gliding owls a-roam,
It’s a long ride hacking home !
When you pass the dim farm-houses with their lights that
mark the miles,
When you pass the shepherd’s cottage with the candle on
the sill,
With your thoughts upon a hill-fox and his cunning Border
wiles,

BRIGHT’S DISEASE
For the full understanding of the curative action
of Warner’s Safe Cure, it is necessary to bear in
mind the processes of nature by which human life
is maintained. Reduced to their essential prin-
ciples, these processes are simply the wasting and
renewal of the tissues of the body.
It is absolutely necessary to life that the body
should waste away, and that its substance should
be renewed by food, water, and fresh air. Night
and day this process of waste and replaceman goes
on unceasingly. Every time a man draws breath
his body gains in weight by the oxygen, etc., taken
from the air, and every time he breathes out it
loses weight by the carbonic acid and moisture
given forth.
Insensibly, too, the body is losing weight all the
time. You can prove this by placing your hand
on a cold piece of polished glass, when you will
see that moisture given forth by the skin has con-
densed. Were the body to be entirely covered
with a coat of waterproof varnish, death would
quickly result.
Apart from the skin and lungs, the organs em-
ployed in this process of waste are the kidneys and
liver, and the maintenance of those organs in
thorough working order is the grand secret of good
health .
The Kidneys. —The function which the kidneys
perform is to filter the blood and otherwise
separate from it the surplus water and the various
impurities which it contains. These impurities
are urea, uric acid, and mineral matter, which,
with water, constitute the urine.
When the kidneys have done their work, the
purified blood is delivered to the veins, and is
returned to the heart, having in its course
traversed the body and become laden with a fresh
supply of waste matter. The heart again delivers
the blood to the kidneys, which once more filter
it and extract the impurities. This process is
continuous.
The Liveh.— The part the liver plays in the
process of waste is chiefly the manufacturing from
the blood the liquid called “ Bile,” which is
delivered by the liver into the intestines, and acts
as a natural cathartic.
The liver and kidneys are very sensitive organs,
fiudden chills, fever, alcoholic intemperance, and
tropical heat are all liable to congest the liver and
reduce it to an abnormal condition. The kidneys
are exceedingly susceptible to inflammation. An
ordinary feverish cold, which closes the pores and
hinders the skin in performing its share in the
removal of the waste products of the body, throws
a burden of extra work upon the kidneys which
they may be unable to perform. Influenza, or
any kind of fever, taxes the kidneys unduly, and
may cause them to break down under the strain.
Any inflammation of the kidneys is very apt to
affect the liver, and vice versa.
Should the liver or kidneys, or both, become
unable to fulfil their purpose thoroughly, then the
blood becomes laden with urinary and biliary
poisons, which are carried to every part of the
body.
Sometimes these poisons become deposited in
the joints or tissues, and cause Rheumatism,
Lumbago, Sciatica, or Gout. In other cases the
blood, being contaminated, is in an unfit condition
to absorb nutriment, which causes Anaemia,
Neuralgia, digestive troubles, and Debility. In
other cases the supply of bile to the intestines
being inadequate, Constipation, with its attendant
evils result; in others, Biliousness. In others
again the impurity of the blood develops boils and
skin eruptions. Sometimes the uric acid is
deposited in the kidneys and produces Stone,
Gravel, and urinary and bladder troubles.
The reason, then, that Warner’s Safe Cure cures
so many apparently diverse disorders is that they
all proceed from one cause, namely—the inability
of the kidneys or liver to do their work properly,
and so rid the blood of these poisons in the
manner provided by nature.
Warner’s Safe Cure has complete mastery- over
functional and chronic liver and kidney derange-
ments. and by restoring those vital organs to
health and activity, does away with the cause of
these several complaints. When the kidneys and
liver are efficiently carrying out the wonderful
scheme of work allotted to them by nature, none
of the disorders here enumerated can exist.

relating to Warner’s Safe Cure and the diseases it
cures will be sent post free to any address on

An engineering correspondent to The
Bulletin :
“A novel valve-gear, invented by J. T. Marshall, of
Leeds, Eng., and which can be fitted at a small cost on
to any engine, is being adopted, after exhaustive experi-
ment, bv Great Northern Bailwav, Eng. Two ancient;
locomotives, built in ’B2 by Dubs, Glasgow, were used ini
trials. The boilers were very small, of less than 1000 ft..
heating surface, with 17|in. by 26in. cylinders and six;
driving-wheels, of sft. dia., total weight being 70 tons.
No. 1 engine was fitted with Marshall’s valve-gear, while’
No. 2 was unaltered. No. 1 hauled up an incline of 1 in,
7li a load of 307 tons, or over 50 per cent, more than,
similar engine (No. 2) with, old valve. With identical,
loads, coal consumption of No. 1 was 46 - 21 b. per mile
against No. 2’s 57'71b. With a 60 per cent, heavier load,
No. l’s consumption was 031bs. against No. 2’s 071bs. The
valve-gear keeps absolutely cool with a marked absence
of shock, and the blast is peculiarly long-drawn and soft,
and seems to have solved the spark-throwing problem so
disastrous to bush and crops in vicinity of railways. Old
engines of any sort fitted with this valve can be made to
do 60 per cent, more work at a much lower working-
pressure, and with less fuel. This invention should be a
great boon not only to railway's and. ocean steamers, but
also to mining.”

The Manuka.
My lady asked for a flower to wear, .
To dwell like a kiss in her dear brown hair;
So, questing wide for fragrance and hue,
I wandered my island-garden through,
And back to my sweetheart-love I went
With treasure of blossom-trove opulent.
I had climbed afar to those slopes forlorn
Where the glaciers grim and grey ax e born ;
And from its chalices green I chose
Our snow-white lily of the snows.
The Alps of their diadem I despoiled
To grace my dear with its grace unsoiled.
I had gathered for her the wealth untold
Of the spendthrift kowhai’s showering gold,
When the sombre bush in the wet Spring days
Is lit with its drooping boughs ablaze,
And it seems, by the gold on the hill-side strewn,
As if Autumn, enchanted, had come too soon.
I had brought the clematis, trailing far
Its constellation, star by star ;
As, with slender arms wound amorously,
It nestled high in a stalwart tree,
In its silver radiance shimmering
Like the crown on the brow of an ancient king !
The honeysuckle that over me flashed,
Red on the rewa, like blood-drops splashed,
The spear that the koromiko bore,
The shy black blossom the mapau wore,
The ribbon-wood with its foam of white —
These, and more, for my love’s delight.
I had broken for her a spire of bloom
The cabbage-tree’s feathery silver plume—
Whose giant bouquet drooped as if spent,
Sick with its burden of heavy scent,
While the tussock plain and the raupo-swamp
Stood panoplied in its splendid pomp.
And, then, to crown my love’s desire
I had gathered a flame of rata-fire,
Where the ancient trees, like monarchs. dread,
Draw over their shoulders their robes of red,
And, the bush with their glory smouldering—
They stand in their crimson, king by king !
But my lady pouting, dissatisfied,
My odorous opulence tossed aside,
With, “ This is too splendid, and this too rare,
For a modest Maoriland maid to wear ;
The only blossom that mine I would call
Is a blossom common and dear to all! ”
And she took from where it had lain unseen,
Smothered in color, a sprig of green,
Strewn thick with stars, till gem by gem,
It glowed like a delicate diadem,
Whose fragrance, pungent, sweet, intense,
Was myrrh and aloes and frankincense.
“ Stalwart and hardy the manuka stands,
Fine and sweet over all our lands,
And common and lowly it flourishes wide
And waits for my coming at each road-side ;
And the swift, clean perfume that it imparts
Is dear as the heather’s to exiled hearts !
“ In its sombre armies it crowds the hills
Till Summer upon it a splendor spills,
And each tiny quiet, green, leaf is lost
Beneath a ripple of silver frost,
And faintly white do the gullies show
With a dainty fall of its blossom snow ! ”
And my lady lifted the blossom-spray,
Sweet and white in its bride’s array,
And she breathed, “ It is neither rich nor grand,
But it is the blossom for Maoriland ;
The Manuka is my own land’s wear,”
And the Manuka gemmed her dear brown hair.

The Garden of My Heart.
Beyond the purple portals of the Western summer
sky—
Where sun-flushed cloudlets float in happy sleep,
Like showers of curling petals from a rose which,
fain to die,
Sheds the casket of her soul in perfumed heap—
Lies a garden of delight,
Where a sighing summer night
Sings a madrigal of longing in a low, delicious
croon,
Till a heart awakes and quickens in the lonely,
silent moon.
Beneath the lamp of Venus, where the love-light
hovers low,
Waits a throne of regal lilies for a queen,
While a surgeless river murmurs with a lang’rous
ebb and flow
As it wends its way, a thousand stars between.
And it plays upon my heart,
With its soft seductive art,
Like the cunning master-fingers of the tender
Lord of Love
On a harp of hazy harmonies, whose strings were
tuned by Jove.
Thro’ avenues of blossom, where the brooding
shades of night
Scarce seemed to breathe, and thrall’d the dewy
flowers,
Came footsteps softly stealing, while an iridescent
light
Lit the great magnolia leaves in all the bowers;
And the stately shimmering beds
Of the lilies bowed their heads:
Every tree bent down to kiss her as she passed
them on her way,
And the air strove to enfold her, and the breezes
whispered “ Stay ! ”
Thus in the spell-bound garden groves, a pulse
began to beat
That woke th’ enchanted poppies from their
dreams,
And thrilled the waiting lilies, as I led her to the
seat
That had blazed alight with flashing firefly
gleams:
Eor I wrought this fairy throne
Just for “ Her I love ” alone,
Where she reigns with sway despotic, but herself
may not depart
From her kingdom —for she’s captive in the
garden of my heart.

SATURDAY. APRIL 12, 1902.
The Decay of Agriculture.
The year just closed showed a large falling-
off in the cultivated area of both New South
Wales and Victoria, and probably, when the
returns are all in, something of the same
kind will be found to have happened in some
other States also. This unlooked-for episode
has given the community something of a
shock. Agriculture is the “great natural
industry ” par excellence. The man on the
land is the country’s pride, its bone and
sinew, its principal defence, its Boer-
shooter, its main source of increase—for the
habit of being born has a tendency to die
out in cities —and the source of most of its
political flapdoodle. The invitation to go
on the land has been in the mouths of Aus-
tralian politicians ever since there were any.
The pride and boast of every Ministry has
been its fixed resolve to settle the people on
the land. The pastoral industry has crum-
bled miserably through drought, rabbits,
ticks, low prices, Argentine competition,
and other troubles. The gold industry is a
fading quantity over Eastern and Central
Australia. And if agriculture begins to fade
also the situation will be interesting, if not
disastrous.
• * * *
In Sydney and Melbourne alike, the Re-
spectable Press has arisen to explain the
situation. InN.S.W., it seems, O’Sullivan’s
public works minimum wage (paid out of
loan moneys) of ss. 6d. to 7s. a day accord-
ing to the brawn of the worker, is the
cause of the trouble. This may be the case
to some extent, but, even if it is, it doesn’t
make the position much better. Public
works, even if there were six O’Sullivans
to scatter jobs around instead of one, are a
precarious and shifting resource, and if the
persons who offer this explanation tried
heaving the mighty pickaxe in a stifling rail-
way cutting for from 335. to 425. a week
they would probably decide that going on
the land must be a fearsome undertaking if
such a wage for such work could tempt any
man off it again. Melbourne Age says, in a
general way, that the trouble arises in its
State through want of encouragement on the
part of the Ministry, theneglect and incapacity
of bell-.toppered persons in Govt, offices,
and the want of something vague and un-
specified in the head of the Minister for
Lands, or the Minister for Agriculture, or
some other Minister. This is a shadowy ex-
planation, and though the pitiable muddle
and backwardness of the "Vic. Lands Depart-
ment, which doesn’t know what land it has
to sell, and takes 18 months or five years to
get a simple application through, and the
painful dryness of an Irrigation Department
which never irrigates anything nowadays,
account for a great deal, they don’t explain
everything—not by a long way.
* * * *
Some, at least, of the causes are of a kind
that the Respectable Press can’t be expected
to mention. The Bulletin thinks it recog-
nises these eight :
(1) The export of a considerable section of the agricul-
tural population to South Africa to murder another agri-
cultural race which never did us any injury.
(2) The barrenness and drought-stricken character of
a great portion of the agricultural country, which makes
it necessary to plough up two acres in order to get as
much grain as the American gets off one, or four acres to
get as much grain as the Englishman gets off one.
(3) Want of irrigation to counteract this difficulty. (It
is difficult to borrow the money to irrigate with, and the
irrigation works would probably not pay interest on the
money if it was borrowed, and it is against all Aus-
tralian rule, precedent, and principle to do any public
work without borrowing the money.)
(4) High railway freights to the consuming centres.
Owing to the fact that the railways were built with loan
moneys, instead of out of the proceeds of land sales,
freights are twice as high as they would be if there were
no interest to pay. These high freights gnaw away an
unreasonable proportion of what little income the agri-
culturist makes out of his barren acres.
(5) The want of a large manufacturing population to
consume the agriculturist’s products. Already there is
very often a surplus for export to Western Europe—prac-
tically the only outlet. And the Australian farmer, who
has to plough and sow and reap about twice as much
ground as the American or Russian to get the same
quantity of wheat, and then to pay about twice as much
freight to get it to Europe, can’t make enough out of
growing grain for export to live as a while man should.
That is taking the farmer on an average. There are
isolated spots where things are otherwise.
(6) The unconscionable number of middlemen who bite
at the farmer’s scanty profits before his produce reaches
the market.
(7) The Cheap Loaf Superstition. It is understood
that boots, hats, clothes and other things should sell at a
price which will allow of the workman getting a decent
wage for a day’s work, but somehow this idea is never ex-
tended to agriculture.
(8) Last, and worst of all, the growing Landlord Class.
The squire is becoming acclimatised in Australia and
threatens to be the same curse here that he is in Eng-
land, Hungary, Portugal, and elsewhere. The land
syndicate and the private landlord, who don’t cultivate
their own acres but sublet them to rack-rented tenants,
are spread over a very small section of Australia counted
by mere acres, but they hold an enormous proportion of
the good part of Australia. And in many places where
agriculture, even for the sake of exporting the produce
to the other end of the world, would pay handsomely if
there were no exorbitant landlord to support, it does not
pay while that elevated loafer and frequent absentee is
living on the game. The Clarke curse and the Berry
curse and the A.A. co. curse and the V.D.L. co. curse and
the Peel River co. curse have all to be reckoned with.
* * . * *
The landlord trouble is not confined to
N.S.W. and Victoria, in South Australia,
a few years ago, it was announced that, out
of a little over 16,000,000 acres in private
hands, only 5,500,000 were occupied by the
owners, while 10,500,000 were occupied by
people who paid rent to the personal or joint-
stock squire. But in S.A., where the evil
reached its worst, it has decreased somewhat
by reason of the vigorous legislation of the
Kingston Government. In N.S.W. and
Victoria it seems to be increasing. In 12
coastal counties of N.S.W.—the richest part
of the State—nearly one-third of the land is
now held under private rental, and the area
has increased largely since ’95. This is the
district in which iand has been most closely
subdivided, but subdivision in itself is not
a cure for landlordism. The loafer who
sub-lets 500 or 1000 acres * is quite as
grasping a rack-renter as the loafer who
sub-lets 10,000 or 100,000 acres'. The policy
of breaking up the big estates is a good one,
but something more is required. The
whole landlord class is objectionable. In a
very large proportion of cases the landlord
is a non-producer, and the non-producer in
any shape is a burden on the community.
The agent who collects the rents and draws
up the leases, and the agents’ clerk, dun
and bum-bailiff are also non-producers
created by landlordism. The landlord,
especially the large specimen of the breed,
has an incurable tendency to become an
absentee, and when a man, or a group of
men, receiving, say, £30,000 a year in Aus-
tralian rents, settles permanently abroad, it
is exactly the same as if Australia borrowed
£1,000,000 at 3 per cent, and then dropped
the money overboard in the deepest part of
the Pacific. In each case there is £30,000
a year going out and nothing coming in to
balance the account.
■* * * *
The objects of democratic legislation
should be : (1) To break up large estates ;
(2) to extinguish the absentee landlord,
whether he be large or small (incidentally
the absentee money-lender and mortgagee
are equally in need of extinction) ; (3) to
extinguish the agricultural and pastoral
landlord, whether absentee or otherwise. In
other words, it should aim at a condition of
things under which the man who cultivates
the soil and the man who owns the soil are the
same man—except when the cultivator is a
tenant of the State. The N.S.W. law,
which taxes alike the absentee landlord who
spends his rents abroad and the local one
who spends his profits in the country, which
makes no distinction between the man with
1000 acres and the one with 100,000,
which treats the loafing, rack-renting squire
or syndicate as well as it does the person
who cultivates his own acres, is wholly
undemocratic. It seems rather to have
encouraged than retarded the formation of
big estates, judging by the following figures,
taken from Coghlan’s Statistical Regis-
ter, and dealing with the thickly-settled
coastal districts exclusively :
In Holdings of 10,001 Acres and Upwards.

berland 512,438 619,975
Cumberland, Camden, St. Vincent,
Dampier and Auckland .. .. 80,430 106,755
This takes in the whole coastal district—the
most thickly-peopled district and the one
where the tendency to subdivision is greatest.
And even in this favored and fertile area the
big estates are increasing. And, simultane-
ously, the tenant-farmer, as distinguished
from the cultivator who ploughs his own
holding, is increasing even more quickly.
• * • •
The Victorian land-tax, though it bears
more directly on large estates than does that
of N.S.W., also does nothing to discourage
the curse of the absentee and the syndicate,
and the lazy, rack-renting squirearchy. And
even the South Australian law—the one
democratic statute of the lot—though it
falls (somewhat heavily) on the big land-
grabber, and falls (not a quarter so heavily
as it should) on the absentee, makes no
special effort to discourage the parasite who
sits around and collects rents as distinguished
from the man who really works on the soil.
The Bulletin’s theory of what a land-tax
ought to be, or of something like what it
ought to be, is as follows :
(1) Every agricultural and pastoral estate to be free of
taxation up to a value of £6OO, provided the owner
resides on it and personally puts it to good use. All
value above £5OO to be taxed—say Jd. in the £ up to
£lOOO ; Id. in the £ on all values above £lOOO and up to
£l5OO ; ljd. in the £ on all values above £l5OO up to
£5OOO ; 2d. in the £ from £5OOO to £lO,OOO ; 2£d. in the £
from £lO,OOO to £25,000 ; 3d. in the £ from £25,000 to
£50,000; 4d. in the £ beyond that.
(2) Where the land is not occupied and put to good use
the £6OO exemption to be abolished.
(3) Where the land is owned by an absentee, defined as
a person who spends more than six months in any one
year out of the Commonwealth, the rate to be increased
one-half during the year or years of absenteeism. A
company or syndicate to be deemed an absentee if its
head office is outside the Commonwealth, or if more than
half its share or debenture capital is held by absentees.
(The work of defining whether a company is or is not an
absentee would supply some profitable employment for
the lawyers.) When a local co. is turned into an absentee
co. through the departure of certain stockholders, the
co. to have power to charge them with the extra tax to
which their default renders it liable.
(4) Last, but not least, a tax of 25 per cent, on all rents
derived from agricultural or pastoral property, for the
express discouragement of the landlord-class as dis-
tinguished from the class of resident owners and culti-
vators.
* * • »
There is no reasonable present hope that
any of the State Parliaments will take up
this policy, but there is a chance of the
Federal Legislature doing so when the
tariff and other things are out of the way,
and the bumptious Sydney Smith and his
fellow obstructionists have ceased from
troubling. There is a great work to be done
in the matter of getting rid of the absentee,
the land-syndicate and land company, the
rack-renter, the incipient squirearchy, and
the whole tribe of persons who own land in
the small fertile area of Australia, and put it
to no good use, and only serve to block
settlement, while the genuine farmer is
driven into the Central or Western districts to
degenerate into semi-barbarism while hope-
lessly arguing the point with Nature. There
is room in the comparatively fertile Eastern
Division of N.S.W. for all the agriculturists
of N.S.W.—for all of them twice over.
When that is filled up there will be a large
population from which to raise the money
for irrigating the dry and horrible interior,
and the work may then be really possible.
But the country can’t be effectively opened
up on the landlord-and-tenant system, and
the small landlord is only a little less
objectionable than the large one. The
European countries where agriculture really
makes people rich are in every case the
countries where small independent farmers
predominate, as in France, Holland and
Denmark. The countries where it decays
are the lands of squires and tenants, like
England and Scotland. The small indepen-
dent farmer takes a greater interest in his
holding and works it to better purpose than
the mere tenant ; he doesn’t become an
absentee cadging for a title in London and
draining Australia of money in rents ; and
when this country’s hour of trouble comes it
will find that it is the small independent
agriculturist (the one we have been burning
out in the Transvaal) who will be its main
defence. Five hundred sturdy farmers make
a formidable regiment when they are holding
a mountain pass and all they have, or hope
to have, in the world lies on the other
side. A white-handed aristocrat in London,
and 500 tenants who expect shortly to be
evicted, or to have their rents raised, and who
hear that an enemy is corning to burn the
landlord’s farm-houses and their own mort-
gaged crops, and to seize their own mort-
gaged cattle, are a very different kind of
defence. They are apt to drive off the mort-
gaged cattle and shift the movables, and let
the landlord’s house be burned. The old
saying applies here once more: “No man
ever shouldered a musket in defence of a
boarding-house,” and when Australia can’t
pay its defenders 4s. 6d. a day, but has to
call on them to fight gratis, it may realise
the fact.
The Tasmanian Mendicant at the Gate.
The election'of William Hartnoll to replace
F. W. Piesse, the lately-deceased Tasmanian
was partly a protest against the
abolition of Tattersall’s gamble, partly a com-
pliment to a generally-respected but hideously
Tory Tasmanian legislator, and partly an uprising
of the Party Which Doesn’t Want to Pay its
Way. In Tasmania just at present the Party
Which Doesn’t Want to Pay its Way is very
much in evidence. Its principal organ—which is
also the principal Freetrade paper of the island—
Launceston Examiner, openly demands that
Tasmania shall apply to the Federal Parliament
for loans to goon with, under clause 96 of the
Constitution, which provides that the Australian
Legislature may assist shoeless States that &re in
great want of a square meal. /The Examiner and
its party claim openly that Tasmania is such a
State. Of course, the Federal Parliament can’t
lend any of the money of Queensland or S.A.,
winch are also in great straits. Victoria and
N.S.W. are just pulling through with difficulty,
especially since the latest reductions in the tariff,
and can’t spare any of their surplus either. So the
probable result will be that Federal loan money
will be applied to the revenue purposes of any
impecunious State that wants aid. And the in-
terest on the loans will make the impecunious
State a little more impecunious.
* * * m
. Tasmania, in the old separate days, had a mas-
sive tariff. It was partly protective, but mostly it
was a very heavy revenue tariff of the George
Reid pattern. It wasn’t originally designed for
systematic Protection but simply for raising
money, though it protected a good deal by acci-
dent. In the last complete year of the old Tas.
tariff (1900) it yielded £464,425 —equal to a little
over 23 per cent, on all imports. Tasmania barely
paid its way with this tariff; that is to say, it had
a surplus of about £120,000, and it used £160,000
of loan money a,s revenue, so it was really £40,000
short. Tasmania, when it joined the Common-
wealth, was well aware that union meant the
abolition of duties on all its purchases from the
other States, and that involved the Toss of perhaps
£lOO,OOO a year of customs revenue. And it
sent an unexpectedly strong delegation of Free-
traders to the Federal Parliament to demand the
reckless cutting down of the rest of the revenue.
They were not so successful as they hoped to be —
still they managed to lose so much Tasmanian
revenue that, whereas the island’s customs and
excise together yielded over £489,000 in 1900,
they are now only yielding at the rate of
about £300,000 a year, or even less with
the recent further abolition of duties. Now
Tasmania returns William Hartnoll, who
demands a further reduction of duties from
the present rate, which is about 20 per cent, on all
goods imported from outside the Commonwealth,
to 15 per cent. Even supposing that, imports in-
creased 20 per cent, under a lighter tariff (which
is highly improbable, as the country hasn’t the
means to pay for them) this would mean a further
heavy loss of Tasmanian revenue. And Tasmania
declares itself a beggared and stranded community
already.
* * * *
By way of showing the advantages which wont
accrue if its policy is adopted, and the millennium
that won’t arrive, the great Freetrade organ of
Tasmania declares that, though the Federal
Government has materially reduced the customs,
duties on goods imported from outside the Com-
monwealth, still prices have not gone down, but,
have rather tended upwards. In fact, this is.
what it does say (Launceston Examiner, May
18): —-
There has been a notable remission of taxation throughi
the Customs. The consumer has not benefited by it to.
the extent he would have done had revenue duties only,
been imposed. Although he will not pay so much at the-
Customs House, he does not find the price of com-
modities decreased owing to the protective character of ;
the duties : in fact, in some cases prices are higher.
The Examiner finds, in short, that under a 20*
per cent, duty prices are as high as, or higher-
than, they were under a 23 per cent, duty ; but it.
consoles itself with the idea that a 20 per cent.,
duty which is meant to be Protective puts up.
prices, while a 23 per cent, duty which is levied!
on the same goods, with no definite intentions,.,
keeps prices down.
* * * *
According to Freetrade papers and politicians ,
all duties are paid by the consumer ; in fact it ;
is clainied that the consumer pays about twice-
as much as the duty amounts to. Under these-
circumstances it is difficult to see how the;
Freetrade party in Tasmania has anything to.
complain of. That island has now about £180,000)
a year less customs revenue than before. There-
fore, by all the canons of the Shoddy Party the.
people of Tasmania pay about £360,000 less than,
they did. Therefore it is only necessary for them!
to pay, say, £200,000 more in direct taxation, andi
the State Treasury will be richer than before, andl
the people will be £160,000 a year richer tham
before also, and Tasmania, instead of being at
mendicant howling dismally at the gate, will be ini
a glow of affluence. It is all so beautifully simple,
that it is impossible to see, on any Freetrade basis;
where the trouble comes in. Tasmania’s land-tax
is only £d. in the £ as compared with Id. in
N.S.W., and that alone furnishes an opportunity
for raising a good deal of money. It has no special
tax on large estates. It has no absentee-tax. If
it levied another £lBO,OOO a year of direct taxation,
and thereby put its finances on a reasonably sound
basis, its people would only be paying as much per
head, in State, Federal and local taxes, as the
English people do. At present they pay about 25
per cent. less. It is no part of the business of the
Federal Government to come to the assistance
of a State whose financial troubles arise solely
from the fact that it is resolved to pay about
£lBO,OOO a year less taxes under Federation than it
did when it was a separate State, merely, it would
seem, because there is now a Federal Parliament,
on which it hopes to shunt part of its responsi-
bilities. The election of William Hartnoll
ought to settle that matter definitely. Tasmania
having been relieved of a lot of taxation, accord-
ing to the theories of William Hartnoll, whom
Tasmania has just returned by a huge majority,
and having refused to put on new taxation to fill
the gap, is short of money. It elects, by a large
majority, a man who is pledged to barrack for a
further reduction of taxation, to make things
worse. It deserves to get that further reduction.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Latest African Tale.
The latest version of that gruesome story from
South Africa is, after all, only in keeping with
the accounts that many of the Australian and
Maoriland eohentingenters gave of themselves in
those letters which they sent home to their proud
relatives, and which the latter proudly handed
over for publication in admiring Jingo papers.
These contingenters described themselves as
thieves, looters, and brutish mutilators of the
dead, and it is now alleged that some Aus-
tralians, at all events, have lived up to the
character they gave themselves. The newest
English account of the proceedings which led
to the execution of one English and one
Australian officer, and the sending of two
more to penal servitude, drops all mention of the
alleged “Boer outrage” which was at. first set
up as provocation. (It is also alleged most flatly


by a returned cohentingenter that the “ Boer out-
rage ” yam was a lie, that Captain Hunt was shot
dead in fair fight, that his men promptly
bolted, and that when Hunt’s body was re-
covered there were no marks of ill-usage upon
—not one. The Boers hadn’t even knocked out
any of the teeth to keep as souvenirs, as some
horrible Australian contingenters boasted that
they did. And General Ketchener says there was
no evidence to support the alleged outrage on
Hunt. ) And in any case the ‘ ‘ outrage ” story tiad
this weak point at the outset : it set forth that
a recklessly brutal British officer ordered the
indiscriminate killing of all Boers, even if they
surrendered, and apparently whether they were
wounded or not, and that when the Boers took
him prisoner they killed him —according to a very
common prejudice against his butchery methods.
But even this story drops bodily out of the new
narrative, which seems to fly off at a tangent and
deal with a completely new set of charges. It
sets forth that certain officers in the British ser-
vice waylaid ten unarmed non-combatants who
were going in to surrender and swear allegiance,
and shot them after a mock trial in order
to get some £20,000 they had in their
possession. It tells of wholesale slaughter
of natives from sheer wantonness; of the
cruel murdering of Boer wounded and the
slaying of boys; of the cold - blooded mur-
der of a German missionary who was sus-
pected of knowing about the murder of the
10 Boers and of an intention to expose the crime ;
of the attempted murder of his servant ; of a
scheme to murder two non-commissioned officers
of their own corps who had refused to assist at the
“execution ” of the 10 Boers, and who were con-
sequently regarded as dangerous characters and
liable to give the show away ; and, finally, of
the secret murder of a trooper who warned
these two non-coms. in time to enable
them to bolt for their lives. This is
the cheerful tale told by a leading London paper,
and it is further added that justice came about
partly at least through the demands of the Ger-
man Consul-General for satisfaction on account of
his lost missionary. Ketchener’s report says
briefly that twelve murders were proved and
others suspected. These things majr be still
rather tangled and confused, but four points stand
out very conspicuously:
(1) The crimes, whatever the exact particulars of them
may have been, and by all accounts they were the
worst episodes in the story of the war, took place last
August, and the matter was kept dark even from the
London papers for over seven months. Therefore, the
art of suppressing news must have been brought to
considerable perfection in South Africa.
(2) When crimes of such magnitude can be kept dark
for seven months, it seems possible that a good many less
sensational outrages may be kept dark for much longer,
or for ever.
(3) The German authorities evidently knew of the
matter long before the British press did ; at all events, it
is said that their Consul’s demands for the replacement
of his lost missionary were responsible for setting
the tardy wheel of justice revolving. And their know-
ledge of it seems to have been previous to that his-
toric outburst of German indignation against the
manners of the British army in Africa. Of course, the
German press statements were dismissed off-hand as
“ pro-Boer calumnies ” ; still, in the face of this latest
version of the business, it would, look as if the German
press, at that date, knew rather more than the suppressed
British press, that its language wasn’t wholly unjusti-
fiable, and that it might be worth while to inquire into
the rest of its “ calumnies.” Apparently on some points
the German press wasn’t any more violent than might
have been expected.
(4) Finally, the meetings of Australian Mayors and
others to indignantly “refute ” all the charges of cruelty
brought against the British forces by the Continental
“ gutter press,” begin to look a trifle foolish. There ap-
pear to be more things in South Africa than even an Aus-
tralian Mayor can “ refute.”
Blood-drunkenness, or Slander—Which ?
Premier Seddon is reported by Sydney D.T. to
have raved last week at Papanui (M.L.):
He expressed disapproval of the action of the Imperial
Government in refusing to accept the offer of Maoris to
serve in South Africa. He promised to make representa-
tions to that effect when he reached London. His opinion
was that if 5000 Maoris under native leaders were given
their own way, and allowed to roam over the Transvaal
untrammelled by existing orders, which at present were
a drawback to the British forces, they would soon put
the Boers down. There was too much kid glove business
going on at the front, but the Maoris never allowed
enemies to hurt them again.
This comes immediately on top of the news about
the execution of English and Australian officers for
numerous cold-blooded murders of prisoners in
S’Africa. The savagery of the speech is so dis-
gusting that it is surely the invention of some
enemy of Mr. Seddon’s, satirising the wild
Jingoism of the erstwhile Democrat. But, if
Mr. Seddon did speak as he is reported to have
done, did advocate the letting loose of 5000
Maoris, “under their native leaders,” “un-
trammelled by existing orders,” men “who
never allowed enemies to hurt them again,”
men from a race who have recently practised
cannibalism and mutilation —on South Africa, then
it will leave an ineradicable stain on Maoriiand’s
history if the man is allowed to remain in political
life, or even in decent society, for another day.
There is no country in the world which should
welcome him as a citizen except Dahomey.
Abyssinia would be much too civilised. The
Bulletin hopes to hear within the next few days,
either that Mr. Seddon has absolutely repudiated
the savagery attributed to him, and brought his
libellers to justice, or that his Cabinet colleagues
have put him under surveillance for medical
examination.

The Point of View.
Some comfort begins to arrive by cablegram :
London, April 4.
The Times this morning says that naturally, but quite
wrongly, the Australians feel the slur which has been cast
on the good nafhe of their soldiers.
The Commercial Advertiser, of New York, in comment-
ing upon the execution of Lieutenant Morant and Lieu-
tenant Handcock, says that the impartial punishment of
colonials by Lord Kitchener ought to check the torrent
of abuse on the Continent against Great Britain.
As regards the second item, why should this event
“stop the torrent of abuse on the Continent?”
The Continental so-called “gutter press,” which
is mostly German in this case, will probably reply
somewhat after this fashion : “ Your men, by their
own showing, were murderers of prisoners on a
large scale, including, it would appear, wounded
prisoners. Even their thin story of provocation
falls through, for, by their own story, the order
to commit wholesale murder was issued before the
alleged slaying of Captain Hunt by the Boers (a
slaying now denied on oath by some of your own
men). Their principal defence was that this
butchers’ work was so common that it shouldn’t
be regarded as a crime—in fact, they pleaded
custom as their defence. And nothing was done
to bring these murderers to justice till the
interference of a German consul, demanding an
inquiry into the alleged murder of his missionary,
helped to drag the whole business into the day-
light, and it had to be inquired into. Even the
superior officer to whom the crimes were
reported hushed the matter up. In no case
where a German consul hasn’t been making a dis-
turbance has anything been done, and it seems
quite probable that nothing would have been, done
in this case either if he hadn’t clamored about his
dead preacher.” That is how the abusive conti-
nental press will look at the matter, and that is
how the British press would look at it in similar
circumstances. As regards the other cablegram,
it is a perfectly fair statement of the case. 1 he
crimes of a few Australian contingenters are not a
slur on the Australian people in general, nor are
the crimes of a few Englishmen a smudge on the
character of all Englishmen. The trouble is that
the same justice isn’t meted out to the other
fellow. The British or Australian crime is a soli-
tary outrage, which reflects only on the perpe-
trator ; the Boer crime, or alleged crime, is always
described as an evidence of the inherent brutality
of the whole Boer race. When Edgar, the Eng-
lishman, was killed in Johannesburg before the war
(even though he was a murderer who had brutally
slain another Englishman, and he was shot by a
semi-Welsh policeman named J ones while resisting
arrest) the incident was quoted in the papers for
months as a proof of all-round Boer brutality,and the
fact that a Transvaal Judge acquitted semi-Welsh
Eolicernan Jones, and told him he had only done
is duty, was held up to execration as an evidence
that there was no justice for a Britisher in Boer
territory. When three British subjects were hor-
ribly murdered in secret at Gatton (Q.) that was
a mere isolated episode, and the idea of holding it
up as a proof of the general brutality of the Aus-
tralian character wasn’t even dreamed of. And it
is so all down the line. When it was believed
that one or two Boers had killed in cold blood
Captain Hunt (the man who gave no quarter even
to the wounded) it was held very generally that
the event, to a great extent, justified the promis-
cuous shooting of Boers in retaliation, in addition
to the killing of the man supposed to be the actual
offender. If any one advanced the equally absurd
theory that the cruelties proved against sundry
British officers would justify the Boers in an
equally promiscuous slaying of British prisoners
the idea would be rightly scouted as that of a
barbarous lunatic. The logic never applies
both ways. The fact that the Boers have
captured and released, in almost every case
with kind treatment, some 20,000 British
soldiers, a clemency almost unknown in the
annals of war, has never been quoted by any
Jingo organ, on this side of the world anyhow, as
an evidence of the kindliness of the Boer race in
general. The very occasional Boer atrocity calls
for something approaching the extirpation of the
whole Afrikander nation as a brutish and mur-
derous community, but the innumerable acts of
humanity proved to stand to the credit, of the
Farmers’ Army are only mentioned as showing that
even among a cruel and degraded people the spirit
of chivalry isn’t quite dead. There have been
more brutal outrages committed in the push
suburb of Carlton (Melbourne) during the period
of the war than have been even charged against
the whole Boer forces. Yet no one has opined
that the Victorian in general is a brute who wants
wiping off the earth, and the person who thus
opined would be a fool of the worst description.
What is the cause of this? Simply the Point of
View and the utter non-existence, at this end of
the world anyhow, of the alleged virtue of
“ British fair-play.” The fact that it is equally
non-existent in other countries doesn’t make the
case any better.
“ Drumhead ” Court-Martials.
Among the many conflicting accounts as to the
wholesale murder of Boer prisoners in South
Africa, there bristles up often the mention of
“drumhead court-martials.” This seems to sug-
gest that the Australian officers executed were in
part, at least, victims of their ignorance of military
law and of the brutal homicidal carelessness—or
worse—of the Ketchener gang in appointing
blacksmiths, drovers and what-not, as responsible
military officers in disturbed districts. Now,
whatever his deficiencies otherwise, the regular
British officer knows something of military law,
and he knows that the “drumhead court-martial”
is a myth. But what was to be expected from
“ officers ” whose whole military training had con-
sisted of a year’s service in a contingent ?
The responsible S’African authorities seem to
have known that ignorance and unscrupulousness
were good qualifications for “ irregular ” officers,
and only when ignorance went the length of murder-
ing a German citizen was the curb put on. Hand-
cock, the “ veterinary lieutenant,” had been a per-
manent-way hand on N.S. W. Railways, and then a
blacksmith, and had gone to S’Africa as a shoe-
ing-smith. Morant was a horse-poet, and
Witton had been for nine months a Victorian
Permanent Artilleryman. Witton was the oldest
soldier of the lot. Morant and Handcock had
no more right to constitute themselves a court-
martial than they had to sit as judge and jury in
an Australian Supreme Court. The Army Act
provides for the holding, in cases of emergency, of
“ field-general courts-martial ” of not less than
three members, at least one of whom must not be
of lower rank than captain. There were only two
members of the “court-martial” which shot
some of the Boers, and neither was a captain.
The convening officer cannot sit on a court-
martial and therefore Morant was barred.
Also the proceedings of such a court are
to be sent “ with all convenient speed and with a
full report of the circumstances ” to the nearest
General. So far from doing that the Bushveldt
Buccaneers kept their little “trials” quiet, and
when a German missionary started for Pietersburg
to tell the British about them, Handcock
set out after him to stop him, and someone
cold-bloodedly murdered him as he was
reading in his tent at night. The story of the
series of deliberate murders carried on by these
irregulars is worse, because more circumstantial,
than any of the “ slanders ” that have appeared in
the French or German press. And, , we repeat,
the chief responsibility must rest with the
persons who were guilty of the criminal careless-
ness, or the sanguinary design, of letting these
irregulars loose on the Boers.

A State Tattersall.
The Tasmanian Government, it is printed (and also
denied, but then almost everythingisdenied moreor
less) threatens to institute State lotteries in place of
the suppressed Tattersall, and that is exactly what
it ought to do. The Federal Postal Department
can hardly stop the delivery of letters to the State
Treasurer of Tasmania—at least it seems improb-
able that it would do so. State lotteries, run on
exactly the old Tattersall lines, would dp no
more harm to Australia’s morals than Tatter-
sall did, and nobody except, the parsons and the
bookmakers ever discovered that he did any
harm. By establishing a State Tattersall,
Tasmania would not only recover its lost
postal revenue but it would also get the
10 per cent, commission (less expenses, of
course) which Tattersall used to get, and that
ought to amount to enough to make up for its lost
customs receipts and put its finances on an easy basis
again. If Tasmania establishes a State Tatter-
sall the staff of this paper will show its practical
sympathy to the extent of taking at least 100 tickets
on next Melbourne Cup, and it will alsodo anything
else in its power to help the proceedings along.
But if that Tattersall is established it must be
a cast-iron rule that all correspondence be
addressed to the State Treasurer or the State
Premier (both addresses should be allowed), and
then the Federal Postal Department can’t block
proceedings unless it stops all letters addressed to
these two potentates —which would mean shutting
up the Tas. Government altogether—or else takes
the almost equally large responsibility of opening
all their letters and inspecting the contents.
+
Pontius Philp and Neil Pilate.
In view of the specially harassed condition of
Tasmania, which reckons that it got its financial
knock-out with the abolition of the tea duty, a
time may be at hand when that indignant State
will leave the infant on the Federal doorstep. In
the old separate days Tasmania’s customs and
excise revenue (£489,000 or so) paid the interest on
its debt and left about £169,000 over for
other purposes. Tasmania’s Braddon and
other Freetraders, who valued their silly
fad more than their country, helped to
cut down the tariff with such enthusiasm
that in March Tasmania’s customs and excise
revenue was at the rate of about £264,000 a-year,
which isn’t sufficient to pay interest on the debt
by some £56,000. Under these circumstances, it
would be a large and picturesque thing if Premier
Neil Lewis called on Treasurer Turner —who is
a much safer man to call on than Kingston
and solemnly handed over the island’s public debt,
and the books and papers connected therewith, and
told him to keep enough of Tasmania’s customs and
excise revenue to pay the interest out of, and
if there wasn’t enough, to alter the tariff and make
it enough, and added that, if ever things changed
and there was a balance in Tasmania’s favor, he
would call for the balance. Queensland’s Premier,
Philp, who is almost in exactly the same situa-
tion, might do likewise. It would certainly hurry
up the question of taking over the State debts.
It would put the tariff question on a business-like
basis. It would make a logical end of the
anomalous position by which the Federal Legis-
lature gets the credit of removing taxes and the
States stand the loss and the Constitution
specially provides that the surplus payable
to any State may be applied to cover in-
terest on its debt. In any case it would
stir the stagnant surface of politics by a gentle
breeze of blasphemy and consternation. After
that episode neither Queensland nor Tasmania
could float any more loans, which would be a
blessed thing for both of them. And the Federal
Government would have to take up the burden,
or there would be such a shaking-up of Australia’s
credit that none of the other States would have
much luck with their future loans, either. Pontius
Pilate once got rid of a big responsibility by
washing his hands. Pontius Philp and Neil
Pilate might do a great deal worse than try the
same experiment.
Irrigation.
An irrigation conference has been gathered
together to consider the best means of watering
the Riverina district of N.S.W. and the mallee
country of Victoria and other dry spots, out of the
waters of the Murray. The Sydney Telegraph,
to which Victoria is as the Pope to Parson Dill-
Mackt, already sees in the proposition a Victorian
conspiracy to get the better of N.S.W., inasmuch
as it is proposed to water a part of N.S.W. which
trades to a great extent with Melbourne, but as
it is impossible to do anything without the puerile
persons who mismanage the Telegraph seeing a
dark Victorian conspiracy in it somewhere, that
matter may pass. The proposed irrigation
schemes, if they can be carried out, will turn a
large area of hideously dry wilderness into valu-
able country. Incidentally, also, they are calcu-
lated to knock out the Murray’s precarious useful-
ness as a navigable stream, and complaints to that
effect have already come to hand, but that aspect
of the business is worth no consideration at all.
The trade on the Murray is not nearly so exten-
sive as is commonly supposed, and even if it were
ten times the amount it is, Australia can’t afford
to keep rivers for navigation when their waters
are so much more urgently required for more im-
portant purposes. It is shameful waste, in this.,
dry land, for a single pint of fresh water to be
allowed to flow into the sea from, the Murray and
Darling system. The engineering problem which
must some day call for solutionis that of diverting
the Murray northward from’ about Morgan in
South Australia, so that instead of reaching the
sea it will peg-out in the great low-lying interior
desert, and the last remnant of its water be used
to moisten the arid inlands. Around the
Murray and Darling there is a vast area
of low country. From Bendigo, in Victoria,
and from the sea-coast in eastern S.A., right
north through N.S.W. to near Charleville in
Queensland, the land is nowhere more than 600
feet high, and most of it much lower than that.
This great plain also covers fully one-third of
S.A. The Murray and Darling are not sufficient,
in any ordinary season, to irrigate more than a
fraction of this plain, but, so far as their waters
will go, they should be used for that purpose, and
they should have no connection with the sea what-
ever. The navigation idea is mainly a specimen of
Australian humor. If the waters of the Murray and
Darling system are used for irrigation, the pro-
duce can be shifted by rail or bullock-dray—there
will possibly be enough produce then to make rail-
ways pay. If the same waters are reserved for
navigation there will be no produce most of the
time, and the chief traffic will consist in removing
deranged farmers to the lunatic asylum. As
regards N.S.W., there is possibly something
grotesque in the idea of going in for large
irrigation schemes in the West when so
much of the comparatively well-watered
coastal country is put to so little practical use,
but still the West must be rescued sooner or
later, so far as rescue is possible. But the work
must be a Federal one, so as to ensure a fair divi-
sion of the scarce and precious fluid among the
States concerned. Victoria supplies the bulk of
the waters of the Murray. N.S.W. contributes a
little of the Murray waters, and most of those of
the Darling, though Queensland also supplies a
portion of the Darling waters. Poor, dry S.A.
supplies practically nothing except an outlet, yet
it is much too late for N.S.W. and Victoria to
take up the attitude (which they incline to do) of
sole proprietors. If the combined Murray-Darling
is exclusively their river, they should long ago
have gathered it up, and shifted the intru-
sive object but of S.A. territory. The irri-
gation problem, on the immense scale pro-
Eosed, is a fascinating matter. There are
uge borrowing and spending possibilities about
it, also great openings for banquets, trips
of inspection, functions at which important per-
sons will turn the first sod and the billionth sod
and the last sod, and will turn on the water and
open things and shut things, and give vent to wild,
whirling eloquence generally. Somebody named
M‘GREaoR has already offered to carry out a great
scheme for somewhere over £5,000,000 and another
great scheme for £6,741,000. The Bulletin
doesn’t know M ‘Gregor, but if O’Sullivan
doesn’t get at his scheme and Dan O’Connor
doesn’t make speeches about it there may be
hopes.
From Brisbane Courier :
It is our pleasant duty (says Geraldton News) to
chronicle the fact that Mr. M. Dempsey has registered an
estate of some 33 acres under the provisions of the excise,
qualifying for the bonus of 4s. paid for cane harvested by
white labor. In connection with this, Mr. Mai.. Macpher-
SON, of Stockton, is prepared to form a gang of white
cane cutters, and has made an offer to Mr. Dempsey to
load and cut his cane at 3s. 3d. per ton, on condition that
Mr. Dempsey lays the rails. We also understand that
Innisfail has registered. This is a step forward, and Mr.
Macpherson will have no difficulty in procuring a good
gang of men.
They are not long in giving practical proof that
the “small holdings” can be run with. white
labor, and it is the small holdings that will save
Queensland. The man who can load sugar in the
stifling holds of the small steam lighters up the
Johnston will willingly cut sugar in the cane-
brakes at a white wage.

The value of General Hutton as military com-
mandant is now fully understood in Australia, if
it never was before. It required a good, loud
militant howler to throw suitable language at
Australia’s Second Very Drunk Federal Contin-
gent of Farm-Burners, and Hutton filled the bill.
The Second Very Drunk Contingent was a failure
all along. It was largely composed of demoralised
returned soldiers, who had lost their _ taste for
work after a long course of burning private pro-
perty, smashing goods and chattels, and dragging
women off to the cohencentration camps. Appar-
ently, many of them had also lost their taste for
fighting, and desertions were constant. So were
other things. The ranks were always being filled
up, and yet the Second Very Drunk Contingent
was always falling short of its proper strength.
When the time came for taking the oath it
fell quite a lot short. There was a depart-
ing of the Farm-Burners to the . four winds
with this country’s lawful victuals inside them,
and, in some cases, this country’s lawful property
under one arm. The Second Very Drunk Con-
tingent was got on board in a frightful state, drew
its month’s advance of pay, and then, in many
cases, sneaked over the side into a waterman’s
boat and was no more seen. When the actual
time of departure came the cohentingent (the
N.S.W. instalment of it, that is) was partly miss-
ing and partly tight, and winking confidentially
at the infuriated Hutton. It departed covered
with objuration, with its original commander sus-
pended for incapacity in allowing it to behave as
it did, and the police are now in pursuit of the
lost portion of it. Either the officers had terribly
bad luck in the selection of their armed drunks, or
else the supply of sober men who are willing to
burn Boer women out of their homes at 4s. 6d. a
day is running a trifle short.
Quaint yell from Launceston Examiner (Tas-
mania) :
It was high time some steps were taken by the British
nation to protest against this wave of lies and misrepre-
sentation. Since the counter-demonstrations have taken
place there has been a partial cessation of ill-feeling, and
its virulence has in many quarters raised up defenders
who previously were disposed to favor the Boer cause.
Evidence, even from German sources, is accumulating to
the effect that there is not the slightest truth in the
assertions made. German residents, and those of other
European nationalities in South Africa, are protesting
against the vilification of the British soldiers, and the
fact that ex-Presidents Kruger and Steyn and General
De Wet entrusted their wives to the keeping, of the con-
querors is the strongest proof possible of their humanity.
There is a postscript to be added to that last
clause. The retreating Boers, in many cases, left
their women behind them, as the French mostly
did when they retreated in 1870, and the Aus-
trians when they were driven through Bohemia in
1866, and the Danes when they were pursued out
of their southern provinces in ’64. In fact, as a,
retreating army can’t well carry a swarm of
women and children with it on long, forced, night-
and-day marches, they are always left behind,
unless the pursuing force consists of Turks,
Afghans, or other such genial characters. But
when the Boers left their women-folk behind
they mistook Ketchener for the ordinary
kind of soldier. They didn’t know that he
would make war on women, burn the,ir homes,
and pen them up with their children in
concentration camps, where the little ones would
perish at the rate of 2000 a month. No Boer
general has been heard of as voluntarily leaving
his wife behind since Ketchner broke loose.
Ip the story of the S’ African atrocities told by an
Australian Bushveldt Buccaneer, now in Mel-
bourne, be true, those two officers deserved —not
shooting, but hanging. Melb. Herald, which
printed it, seemed to have been impressed with its
genuineness. This man said that Hunt was shot
in fair fight; he saw and spoke to the buccaneer
who prepared the body for burial, and there was
no mutilation whatever. The narrator gave a
detailed account, too, of the shooting, in, cold
blood, without the semblance of a court-martial,
of eight unarmed Boer prisoners near Pietersburg
before Hunt’s death. Later on, six other defence-
less prisoners were murdered; and still later a
third lot of three —one being an old man and
another a boy of 16. Also one of the Car-
bineers—Vanburen—was made away with, and
the next victim was a German missionary.
Also, when Hunt was killed at the assault on
Viljoen’s house, he (Hunt) was aided by 200
armed Kaffirs, who were to be permitted to loot
the place afterwards. This is probably the in-
formation which General Hutton hints he holds
back, and, take it all round, it is just what might
be expected of some of the Jingo-press-inflamed
cohentingenters this country exported in its later
drafts. A significant point is that, though
there must be many ex-soldiers in Australia who
knew all about the crimes, until the cables told the
tale not one of them considered the matter suffi-
ciently important to mention. Can anyone sup-
Eose the actions of the Bushveldt Buccaneers to
e isolated eases, or that these officers hadn’t
good precedent for their conduct ? The true story
of the later stages of this “humane” war are
gradually coming to light.

At last half-yearly meeting of the Federal Palace
Hotel Co. (Melb.) the chairman shed another
bitter moan over the cussedness of Parliament in
delaying an inevitable Bill to sanction transfers
of licenses from obscure little drinking-shops to
big restaurants where scores, or hundreds, of
visitors sleep on the premises. The Federal has
long since abandoned all pretence of wishing to
remain a coffee-palace. It would purchase an
adjacent licensed house to-morrow if the law per-
mitted a license to be lifted from one location to
another. The chairman was telling the old
biennial tale to his sympathetic audience when a
Rip Van Winkle shareholder wanted to know
what had become of a license which was located
of yore at the place where the Federal Palace now
stands. Then the chairman, with a sob jp. hia

Something of the great silence that has
lately pervaded Sydney show business is to be
lifted on 19th April. Things have been very deso-
late in recent times around the.city with the large
damp harbor. The Criterion closed through
plague, and, though the episode is ancient history
now, it remains shut. The Royal banged its front
door long, long ago when Musgrove’s Co. gave up
the struggle ; and Her Majesty’s took fire and is
now mostly ash. This left Sydney with the dry
husks of a melodrama and two variety shows—good
enough things in their way but not calculated to
provide soul-food for a great mind. Under these
circumstances, it is pleasing to hear that J. C.
Williamson opens the Royal on 19th April, which
is the Saturday of next week. The co. will
include Miss Janet Waldorf, from the United
States, of whom most people have heard ; and
Mr. Norval Macgregor, of whom everybody has
heard, seeing that the father of one half of him
fed his flock in a famous poem on the Gram-
pians, and the other half of him charged in a des-
Srate and irresponsible kilt at Culloden. Also,
. H. Vincent returns to the Australian stage
for this occasion only after an absence of 12 years.
The season is to be partly Shakespeare and partly
otherwise, and “Ben Hur ”is off for good. That
great Hebrew drama required as much machinery
to run it as would suffice for an ocean-liner, and
it compressed so much bad luck into its short
season that no one feels inclined to build the
gigantic structure up again. The chances are
that the wheel of the Jew’s chariot has run over
the Roman’s ear for the last time in Australia.

Salerno is still the great draw at Sydney
Palace, and he carriesout his remarkable juggling
feats now with more certainty than on the opening
night. Crowded houses have been the rule during
the past week, and the season promises to be a
most successful one.
** * *
•‘The Alhambra Girl,” a comedy of the
mother-in-law order, was revived by the Cosgrove
Co. at Sydney Empire on Saturday night. The
prompter deserved a call for the conspicuous
part ne played in the drama. The Cosgrove Co.
has its good' points, but on first nights it is apt
to leave the impression that some of the co. only
received their parts that same morning. Miss
Lilian Raymond, who plays the lightsome Al-
hambra Girl, gets the married hero into those
weini, unreal troubles that the mother-in-lawed
comic man always experiences on the stage, but is
much too large and solid for her part. Her best
asset is the cynical laugh with which she
sees the troubles and misery that perpetually be-
fall the stout and crushed hero. Miss Rose
Phillips, the Sapho of the other day, makes a
nice, good wife to the worried hero, and a small
girl, lost in a voluminous white gown, gets him
into further unhappiness as his niece. John Cos-
grove takes the part of the hero, and every time a
sin he hasn’t done is found out he gives a subdued
howl and says the avalanche is upon him. Other-
wise, the unhappiness of married life sits ill upon
his round and cheerful countenance, though his
gibbering when the avalanche does descend is
effective. Mr. J. P. West has not lost his
cunning in old-man parts, and the rest of the com-
pany is much as usual, which remark is meant to
be taken severely.

Bland Holt’s “Span of Life ” at Sydney
Lyceum progresses promiscuously through Africa
and other places to packed houses and an extra
appreciative gallery. The wild black sea and the
gaily lighted vessel moving away from the excited
fog-bell on the lighthouse keep to their parts as
well as usual, but some day Mr. Bland Holt
should think of letting fly a seagull from the
wings, or hire a dolphin or two to pop up
occasionally above a stage wave. A good
many horses appear in this drama and
circus round above the heads of the orchestra, and
the Harley Bros, form the living bridge as before.
For originality of idea the play is not up to the
previously staged “ Hearts are Trumps,” but it is
more pleasing to the average public, which likes
its Baker as a stalwart hero, who seizes hostile
foreign Powers by the heels and knocks their
heads against a tree, rather than as a moralising
Australian millionaire. They have simple tastes,
these melodrama goers, and their ideal hero is
built after the manner of Samson, the simple-
minded, lone-hand Jew, who never seems to have
had a really bright idea in his life, but tore up
lions occasionally.
Fitzgerald’s circus still rides, jumps, and
jokes in its old canvas home to crowded audiences.
Miss Rhodesia, the Moultons, the dogs, and the
other performers keep up to their old standard,
though nothing new has occurred to the pro-
gramme since the last time these persons attracted
this paper’s eye. Twenty new acts, however, are
promised for this Saturday, when a changed bill
wul be presented, and the lion is studying a
bright, new part wherein lie will catch flies in an
entirely novel fashion. The lion is said to be a
patient and conscientious study, and sits up late
at night with a wet towel round his head learning
his dialogue.

Sydney Tivoli added the Craggs to its pro-
gramme last Saturday, and those agile acrobats
toppled about in their customary daring fashion.
Just as good a turn in the same style is that of
the Lenton trio, who have now improved a good
deal on their business.

“Sweet and Twenty,” the little three-act
comedy which Mr. Brough introduced to Mel-
bourne on Saturday last, belongs to the sweet and
sickly order of stage stories. In the beginning it
promises to be humorous so far as a quiet vicarage
environment will permit. A handy man-servant
(Robt. Brough) with a light-hearted genius for
dropping crockery and falling through glass
houses and cucumber-frames contributes a series
of smashes to the first act. This casual destroyer
is popular as long as he continues to wreck the
vicar s property, but in the second act he breaks
nothing to speak of, and subsequently he is seen
no more. Miss Susie Vaughan is a similar dis-
appointment. At the outset she appears as the
garrulous mother of Miss Sweet and Twenty, and
her tongue works on a swivel for five minutes
whilst her relatives and friends suffer in silence.
Then she passes away like a whirlwind, never to
return. Also a bright young she-boy assists
the first act. with a few remarks suitable to his
time of life, but leaves the rest of the
comedy to its sentimental fate. “Sweet and
Twenty” gets to t be very soft and unconvining
when the trouble begins. The vicar’s two sons
love the one girl, and she prefers the younger
brother because he wears a naval uniform and
doesn’t look so despondent as the brother who is
studying for the Church. Moreover, the damsel
persists in her rather absurd affection for the same
brother after he has been ejected from the Navy
for being drunk and disorderly. Probably the
other brother spoils his chance by persisting in his
original policy of gloom, for when Cecil Ward
runs to gloom he can be as trying as the toothache.
Cecil intercepts letters and otherwise strives to
prevent .his trustful relative capturing the girl,
put it is always obvious that Love will ter-
riumph in the end. The heroine has set her heart
on marrying the comparatively cheerful boy, and
the heart of a modern British sugar-candy comedy
heroine is not a thing to be bruised. She achieves
her unpromising object in life. The prodigal
returns home for the second time, laden with
virtuous resolves and temperance principles, and
parrots-—the results of a nine months’ sojourn in
Australia, of all places ! Then the girl compels
him to cease pretending that he doesn’t want to
marry her. As for the gloomy plotter who is
qualifying for the Church—well, he doesn’t shoot
himself. The curtain descends upon the sad fact
that he has decided to live on. The pistol goes
off, but the man remains.

Miss Brenda Gibson plays the heroine
quite charmingly, and with all the necessary
power where force is wanted. The emotions of
the brethren, one of whom —Ernest Vere —has
only one note, in his voice, excite no sympathy
from the audience, whereas Miss Gibson gives
warmth and interest to her side of the story.
Miss Emma Temple is not at all old and earnest
m an elderly character. On the other hand,
Charles Garry is the most natural of vicars, though
the dramatist makes him a nonentity in the play.
The vicar seems to be of.no consequence compared
with his wife, an invisible lady who rules the
household from her bedroom upstairs.

The revival of “In Honor Bound ” as a
curtain-raiser to “Sweet and Twenty,” reminds
one that Sydney Grundy couldn’t be guilty of so
stagey a playlet nowadays. Brilliant acting can
blind one to the falsity of a play which is at
least smartly dialogued. The performances of Mr
and Mrs. Brough, Orlando Daly and Miss Chat-
teris were not brilliant enough for that. Besides,
Miss Chatteris displayed a pair of red hands
against a white satin gown, and no artificial situa-
tion will support a red-handed lady in full evening

“The Wrong Mr, Wright” has come to
stay many weeks at Melbourne Bijou. Seeing
that the third eccentric comedy by Broadhurst ie a
rather more violent success than the previous two
—“Smith” and “Jones”—the talent of the
author probably amounts to genius. Broadhurst’s
stones are naturally farcical, or farcically natural,
it doesn t matter which. His characters have a
more human interest for the world in general than
the world is aware of whilst they are rushing
through their work. “ The Wrong Mr. Wright,”
in particular, appeals to the feelings of the
accountants and clerks’ association, and all other
inky toilers, for when the full-blooded, close-
fisted millionaire in the uncharitable frock-coat
has been converted to tweed knickers and a
flaming red vest by the artful touch of
woman s hand and the sound of a voice
that is music, he raises the salaries of his
clerical staff 50 per cent, by telegram, and dates
the rise back six months. Singleton Sites, from
Chicago, is about the strongest farcical character
an actor Can ever hope to get, and George Wil-
loughby makes a lot of it, although he continues
to discount the effect of his otherwise vigorous
style by toddling to and from the filter. The lady-
detective is a positively picturesque character,
notwithstanding that she has to bump a 13-
stoiie capitalist off the sofa. And to describe
Miss Roxy Barton as a Dream is to understate the
case. She’s the sweetest peach in the whole
Garden of Eden—the brightest daisy in the dell—
the prize-pebble on the beach—
Just once in every twenty years, or so,
The bardlet’s weary fancy turns to love ;
Then some well-appointed vision here below
Takes the semblance of an angel from above.
Now, despite her hats and frocks, he
Can persuade himself that Roxy
Is a plumed and haloed angel from above.
She sits upon a blotting pad, ’tis true,
According to the notions of the crowd,
Whilst her figure, in the poet’s higher view
Is enchantingly reclining on a cloud.
Though she squatted on a box, he
Would declare that dainty Roxy
Was an angel smiling sweetly on a cloud.
Just once in every twenty years, or more,
’Tis good to get away from sordid truth ;
As he gazes at the girl he can adore,
Sure, the baldest-headed party is a youth.
And there’s simple orthodoxy
In this hymn of praise to Roxy,
I or Love’s the true religion of our youth.

py way of starting a newspaper discussion in the

features were added to the present show on Satur-

ronage for the ballet of her declining days. It is

Just as this goes to press an almighty
crowd is listening to the opening notes of Amy
Castles’ Concert in Melbourne; but as to the
quality of those soaring notes this paper can say
nothing till next week. The little girl from
Bendigo, Paris and other plages where they
grow and make singers, is to warble four times in
Sydney Town Hall. She appears on the evenings
of April 17th, 19th, and 21st. All who are unable
to get admission on these dates wilt have a final
opportunity at a matinee on April 22nd,

Williamson, “after due consideration,”
fixed his prices for the Castles concerts at 65., 45.,
and 25., but the speculators quickly saw to it that
Melbourne wasn’t going to enjoy its songbird at
those rates. Day after the plan opened front seats
were snapped at from 10s. 6d. to £l, while hardly
the humblest worshipper far away back in the
South Gallery got there for less than 4s. The
Mayoral reception was a spasm of public adula-
tion. The Town Hall was unapproachable for the
crowds waiting to get but a glimpse of the Castles,
and when she was driven off an hysterical throng
of youths and women crushed almost under the
horses’s feet, and raced after the vehicle up the
street, cheering and shouting in a spasm of intense
emotion. Amy Castles has already got Melbourne
by the wool.

“F.C.” describes a new Melbourne show :
Somebody lately thrust on me a copy of Elijah Dowie’s
paper, Leaves op Healing, and, as I suffer from a chronic
thirst and a squint, I decided to try a course of diluted
Dowie per medium of his local overseer, Wilbur Glenn
Voliva, who has shifted from the little Prahran tabernacle
to Queen’s Hall, Bourke-st. 1 hadn’t been there since
the days when, as the Victoria Hall, Frank Clark exploited
his Silk Stockings company, and my emotions on enter-
ing were considerable. Wilbur, etc., was assisted by
a small dark man with a large head, and a tall fair man
with a small ditto. There were present 30 men, 50 women,
1 Salvationist, 12youngsters,and afox-terrier pup—chough
the last was afterwards ejected. At the singing Voliva
deftly waved the audience to their feet but himself sat—
being a deputy-prophet doubtless carries certain privi-
leges. During the prayers there was considerable groan-
ing and many “ Amens,” chiefly by elderly gentlemen
with a fringe of white hair round a bald top-piece ; these
were evidently epicures in emotions, and took their re-
ligion as soulfully as they would the ballet on week
nights. Voliva’s education as a lecturer has been sadly
neglected, interjections during the alleged sermon find-
ing him utterly lost for a retort. He would consider for
some seconds, then come down on one persistent inter-
rupter with great tonnage ; but meanwhile the objecting
one had thought up a fresh observation, and W.G..V. was
paralysed for a further space. Voliva said the Faith-
healing meetings were held on Wednesdays, and though
I reckoned he was coming the double on me, I risked a
second attendance. This time he was assisted by a
couple of phonographs, or gramophones as he called
them. These related, among other items, Mrs. Dowie’s
address to the women of Zion, and from the method of
its delivery I opine Mrs. D. to be a short, fat woman who
labors heavily in her speech. Also, I fancy she ran up
several hills just before speaking into the’machine. I
reckoned the healing business was about due, but either
the apostle hadn’t enough faith, or the collection wasn’t
up to the mark, or something ; anyhow, there was no
healing.

H. : (1) It is simply that out of every Is.
Eaid by the insured, and of every Is. of interest produced
y the accumulated funds, the Industrial Department
spends 6Jd. in expenses, and 5Jd. is left to pay for actual
assurance. (2) Try the 3d. a week table ; allow for. the
fact that years must pass before the bank would allow
any interestand, in the period you mention, the Savings
Bank would give over £4O against the co.’s £3O. And if
the payments are dropped before maturity , as they are in
the majority of cases, the bank gives back the money paid
with interest ; the industrial assurance concern doesn’t,
which more than sets off the death-risk. (3) You
assume that a proprietary office is safer than a
mutual, one if all the big policy-holders die by
epidemic, because the shareholders must stand the loss,
but it all turns on whether the shareholders’ capital is
big enough to. stand it. The Citizens’, for example, has
£8,376,000 of insurance in force, and £20,000 paid-up
capital, also £lBO,OOO of callable capital, though no co.
expects to collect all its callable capital at a crisis ;
the A.M.P. has nearly six times the business, but its
reserve-fund (£245,000) is 12 times the other co.’s paid-up
capital. And the reserve-fund doesn't take £2O per cent,
dividend out ofthe profits. (4) The Ordinary Branch of the
Citizens’ was run last year at a cost, including dividend,
of about £l5 15s. 6d. per cent, of total income, which was
very cheap. The A.M.P. was run for about £9 2s. per
cent., which was a lot cheaper, and the Maoriland Govern-
ment Department for £l4 9s. lid. As regards your state-
ment that proprietary management must be cheaper than
the mutual system, the five most cheaply-managed British
offices are mutual societies, and the 23 most costly are
proprietary. This is dealing with British offices only ;
you can find the figures in Whitaker’s Almanac for 1902.
The expense-rate of the most cheaply-managed British
proprietary office is more than double that of the most
cheaply-managed British mutuai society. The expense-
rate of the most expensively-managed British proprietary
office is more than 4J times that of the most expensively-
managed British mutual office.

That misleading and gasbaggy politician, Theo-
dore Fink, M.L.A., has been lecturing in Melbourne about
the need for retrenchment to save the State from
insolvency and in the course of the proceedings (Age
report) he explained that “ Victoria was the heaviest-
taxed land in the world—he meant of civilised countries.”
This dull lie, which the Tory person tells in almost every
country, was originally invented by that Tory person to
avoid paying a.reasonable amount of taxation, but it is so
pitiably silly in Victoria’s case that it seems strange
that Fink should lend himself to it. Victoria is less
heavily taxed (local and national taxes included) than
Great Britain, France, Holland, Queensland, Westralia,
Tasmania or Maoriland. Taking national taxation in the
Australasian States alone this is how the results compared
during last financial year (figures from Coghlan’s
“ Statistics of the Six States of Australia and Maori-
land,” page 24):
Total Taxation.
Northern Territory .. .. £6 10 2 pel head
Westralia 6 6 2 „
Maoriland .. „ .. 319 8 „
Queensland .. .. „ 313 8 „
Tasmania .. „ 312 6
Victoria 214 11 „
South Australia .. .. 212 8 „
N.S. Wales 2 4 7 „
This includes direct and indirect taxation. In direct
taxation (principally land-tax, income-tax, probate and
stamp duties—the kind of taxation the Tory most objects
to) the results come out thus :
Direct Taxation.
£ s. d. £ g. d.
Maoriland, 1 0 4 p. head N.S.W., 0 15 8 p. head
Tasmania, 017 3 „ Queensland, 013 3 „
Westralia, 016 0 „ Victoria, 012 1 „
S. Aus., 015 9 ~ N. Territory, 0 8 4 ~
The Tory person who originally invented the yarn about
Victoria’s heavy sufferings from quite unusual taxation was
just a plain liar; the Tory person who repeats them is either
a silly ignoramus or something else. The curse of Australia is
that poor, whining, unmanly, un-British coward, the Tory,
who, in lightly-taxed States like Victoria, S.A. and N.S.W.,
is always weeping about the excessive burden of taxation,
till he persuades the people that it is really impossible for
Australia to pay enough taxation to cover its outgoings,
and, under that impression, it goes on borrowing and
getting deeper and deeper in the mire. Tory politicians
who talk this tearful slush about the inability of Australia
to stand any more taxation, even for the urgent purpose
of reducing the great loan curse, are a disgrace to the
manhood of the country. Victoria spends much money
on salaries and foolishness which should go to pay for
railways and other public works, but it doesn’t raise too
much money—in fact, it doesn’t raise enough.
* • • *
Some interesting points:
(1) In New South Wales, and also in some other States,
the Parliamentary authority to raise a loan never lapses.
Therefore See and O’Sullivan, if they feel so inclined, can,
while Parliament is not sitting and without saying any-
thing to Parliament if it was sitting, borrow over
£25,000,000 (twenty-five millions) in London or New York
or wherever the money is obtainable. At various times
during the past 50 years loans to that amount have been
authorised by Parliament but not raised, and the power
may be used at any time.
(2) Money borrowed by N.S.W. for one purpose may be
used for any other puipose. A good many years ago an
Act was passed which gave this remarkable power.
Besides, loans raised nowadays are always for certain
specified purposes “ and other public works.” The N.S.W.
Government raised £3,644,918 for the Sydney land
resumptions and works connected therewith “ and other
public works.” Only about £700,000 has gone in paying
for resumptions.
(3) There is no law stating what kind of works may be
paid out of loans and what kind should be charged to
revenue. Everything is charged to loans, therefore, that
an unprincipled Ministry feels inclined to charge.
South Australia’s Premier Jenkins, while re-
porting a probable deficit of £120,000, spoke comfortingly
about the Crow-eater State’s public debt, which, he said,
was mostly represented by public works that yielded 31
per cent. It is a pity that someone didn’t rise ana
scoff at Jenkins Over £6,000,000 of S.A.’s public
debt (about a quarter of the whole amount) is repre-
sented by no interest-producing assets at all. It
was spent on roads, bridges, fortifications, schools,
Government offices, “improvements to Crown lands,”
dead and gone village settlements, “ geological examina-
tion of the province ” (think of geologically examining
the province out of loans), and over £900,000 was used to
make good revenue deficits. S.A. has to raise about
£300,000 a year now by taxation to pay interest with, that
being the amount that is not provided by the receipts
from its public works, which is a heavier interest burden
on each inhabitant than that of any European country
save France. False prophets and false Jenkinses may

After much amending, the Federal Public Ser-
vice Bill enacts that Federal public servants must insure
their lives with any rotten (or otherwise) life assurance
office Carrying on business in Australia, and if they tan a
with a very had specimen and lose their money, it is
their own look-out. That is to say, a policy for (say)
£5OOO in the Maoriland Government Insurance Depart-
ment (the safest office in Australasia), or in the ocottisn
Widows’ Fund (assets sixteen millions, and probably tne
safest office in the United Kingdom) won t do, because
they have no local offices, while one in the lamenta le
1.01 F., or the People’s Prudential, or the Australian
Metropolitan, because they have local offices, will be quite
sufficient! ! ! If the Federal Government lacks the cour-
age to establish a Life Assurance Department of its own
it should at least nominate the seven or eight local insti-
tutions which are absolutely above suspicion, and strictly
confine the business to them. The Government can t
honorably compel its servants to spend their money on
life assurance without taking some responsibility in tne
way of pointing out where they can assure safely.

The chief reason why Sydney’s water supply is
in a precarious state may be found in the Water and
Sewerage Board’s finances. It should have been laid down
by the Government as that Board’s duty to raise enough
money to pay working expenses, maintenance, intereston
loans, and to gradually pay off the debt, so that when it
became necessary to spend another million or two or three
on an extension of the system it wouldn’t be a case of
heaping one debt on top of another. Instead this is how
things have gone :
Sydney Water and Sewerage Department.
Revenue. Expenditure. Deficit. Surplus.
Dec., 1894 £254,301 £249,943 £1358
June, 1895 128,476 138,458 £9,982
„ 1896 259,843 280,824 20,981
„ 1897 263,637 290,216 26,679
„ 1898 268,570 302,647 34,077
„ 1899 298,288 306,697 8,409
„ 1900 312,433 330,959 18 526
„ 1901 328,639 353,474 24,835
The last year when the Board paid its way was 1894.
There has been no serious increase in management ex-
penses despite the growth of the watered and sewered
area—in fact, the management expenses absorbed a very
much smaller percentage of the revenue in 1901 than in
1896. But as the system grew older and more in need
of repair tlie cost of maintenance increased heavily, and
the interest bill also increased, and these two items
swallowed up the new earnings wholesale after this
fashion
Maintenance. Interest on Loans.
1894 .. £43,411 .. £180,302
1901 .. 67,002 .. 254,030
Any sensibly-managed department would have raised
enough revenue to write off a large sum every year for
depreciation. The money thus raised would have been
applied in reduction of its debt ; so that when the sys-
tem began to grow old and cracked the saving in interest
would have more than balanced the increased cost of
maintenance. The board was partly responsible for the
fact that this wasn't done —only partly. The occasional
surpluses of the early days were not nearly large enough
to provide for depreciation, but, such as they were, they
seem to have been grabbed by the Government and
spent as ordinary revenue, instead of being applied
in reduction of the water and ' sewerage debt.
Thus the board’s debt didn’t diminish ; in fact,
as many things as possible besides extensions
appear to have been charged to it, and both it and the
interest bill constantly increased. The later borrowings
were for the purpose of carrying the Board’s works into
thinly-peopled suburbs, where the returns on the money
spent were less than on the city works, and interest began
to grow out of all proportion to revenue. As the works
grew larger and older maintenance also became a heavy
item. The Treasurer had to supply the Board with
money instead of blewing its profits, because no one had
courage to raise the rates. Despite the increase in the
cost of maintenance, the allowance for repairs seems
to have been kept dangerously low, presumably
out of regard for the anguished Treasurer, and
the works appear to have gone somewhat to seed.
The extension of Sydney on to the high surrounding
country made a water system which depended on
pumping almost obsolete. So now the Jake Garrard
department has all its debt intact, an interest bill that
increases every year, a water system that isn’t worth the
money owing upon it, an unreliable water supply, and a
big annual deficit—all through the early policy of making
things as easy as possible for the moment, and letting
the future slide.
Just by way of showing that there are worse
things in the Water and Sewerage way than even the
Sydney Jake Garrard department, here is the fearsome
record of Melbourne’s Water and Sewerage system, bossed
by hard Fitzgibbon :

By comparison with the awful Fitzgibbon thing in Mel-
bourne (Heaven only knows where It is going to !) Jake
Garrard’s department is a model of solvency. The
Melbourne institution has gone in for wild and fearsome
sewage-farm speculations and other extraneous matters
till its insolvency (unless the Government holds it up)

As the House of Representatives keeps knocking
one item after another off the tariff the revenue keeps
diminishing. Customs and excise yielded £773,952 in
January, £756,429 in February, £721,406 in March, and
the biggest loss (calculated at £600,000 a year) through
the knocking off of the tea, rice and some other duties,
had hardly had time to make itself felt in March.: A very-
little more re-committing of the tariff to please the selfish
and politically mad-drunk M'Miilan and Conroy and
Pumpkin Smith push, and only two States will have a
pretence of solvency left.

There were some large Trustee Companies (large, as far
as their reserves are concerned) in Australia before the
’93 smash, but their reserves were mostly invested in big
buildings with mortgages on them—and there are no big
companies now. Still they are all earning dividends
now,-which was far from being the case a few years ago,
and hi eight cases; the dividend has increased materially
since 1898(the Queensland Trustees has recklessly doubled
its dividend since then). The Perpetual Trustees, Execu-
tors, and Agency of Dunedin (Maoriland), and the National
(Melbourne) seem to make no serious effort at building up
their reserves, and most of their money goes in big divi-
dends, Two strikingly progressive institutions are the
Perpetual (Sydney) and the Ballarat Trustees (Ballarat,
Vic ). The former promises, in another year, to leave
the National behind very badly, and to become the lead-
ing trustee co. of Australia. The Ballarat concern applied
most of its past reserves to writing-off a goodwill item
the price it paid for a business acquired some years ago,
but since it got rid of this incubus its progress has been
very rapid. The Union Trustees would have shown an
addition of £l3B to reserves but for sums written off de-
preciation fund. Taking all things into account, how-
ever, the trustee-business shows up better in these bad
times than most varieties of joint-stock enterprise.

The Equitable Building Society (Launceston,
Tasmania), now in its 32nd year, publishes a solid and
promising balance-sheet for 1901. The year’s profits were
£3Bll. A dividend of 7 per cent, to shareholders absorbed
£3282, and the balance raises the reserves to £13,068. In
comparison with the capital of about £51,000 the reserves
are very substantial indeed.

Kempthorne Prosser and Co.’s New Zealand
Drug Co. (Dunedin, M.L.) publishes a cheerless balance-
sheet for the year ended 31st January, 1902. It sets forth
that during the year the net profits of the business were
£2747. Against this a 7 per cent, dividend is paid,
absorbing £13,549. A sum of £2554 is written off to cover
over-valuation of stock, and this cheerful process of pay-
ing £16,103 when the profits are only £2747 produces
lamentable results. Certain premiums on new shares
(£1527), a matter which, in every well-conducted com-
pany, should be carried to reserves, have been treated as
ordinary earnings; but even with this, the total reserves
dropped from £30,593, at January, 1901, to £18,(64
—a fall of £11,829. For a co. of such dimensions (the
paid-up capital is £194,102) these reserves don’t amount
to much.

Editor Bulletin. —Be par (“Wild Cat,” B.
15/3 ’O2 on the coupon business at Broken Hill. The
’umble individual referred to made such an enormous
profit that a company (not co-operative, but in reality a
syndicate of 25) was formed ostensibly to “ out” the u.i.
They found it such a good thing that the majority of
shopkeepers here resolved to start the Mutual Concern in
opposition to this syndicate. The Mutual Co. is formed
entirely of the local traders, who, seeing that the public
will have coupons, have made their share-list large
enough to admit every shopkeeper as a holder. In
redeeming, they deduct simply the office and working ex-
penses, and then receive back the surplus remaining,
which they themselves have made. It will be readily
seen that they are thus only paying one man a weekly
salary to regulate a cash-discount system amongst them,
and considering the large number of shareholders (over
109) the expense is a mere nothing to them individually.
The shareholders of the Mutual are the most anxious
people to have the coupon-system abolished by legislation,
but, till that comes about, they are simply a self-protective
association against the coupon-fiend, as represented by
syndicates and monopolies.—The “Mutual” Secretary.

Another of the English co.’s that were going to
make pots out of Broken Hill zinc-lead sulphides has gone
under—the Smelting Corporation, which owned the
Burnham process, and spent over £130,000 at Ellesmere.
Things didn’t turn out right; especially when the mining
co’s found it paid best to concentrate the ores, and to cut
the Smelting Corporation out, and it is now seeking more
capital to turn the works into an electrolytic plant for
treating copper.

The Carmichael-Bradford desulphurising pro-
cess is very soon to be pushed. The past six months have
been spent by the co. which now owns it in getting over
the mechanical difficulties which the discoverers
(chemists) hadn’t solved. F. H. Snow, who engineered
the Adelaide tram-concession, takes the new scheme with
him to England—what for the writer doesn’t know, and
the people interested don’t seem to know either. The
experiments with silver-lead sulphides having been satis-
factorily finished (though costs are higher than originally
estimated) the process is now being tried on gold pyrites.

Wrightville (Cobar) branch of the A.M.A., re
par (8., 8/3/’O2), states that the Miners’ Relief Fund has
not affected it in the least. The sec. writes : “We had to
rely upon the doctor’s certificate before the Miners’ Relief
Fund came into existence, and still rely upon it. If the
sick miner now loafs upon the funds, on account of re-
ceiving a few more shillings per week, the doctors are to
blame for allowing him to do so.”

The gold yield in Westralia continues to in-
crease, but the profits of gold-mining are growing much
less as the mines go deeper and working expenses
become heavier. Things have gone after this fashion
since 1896 :

The moral is that lOoz. of gold on the surface, where the
prospector can rush up excitedly and hang his hat on the
projecting knobs of pure metal, are worth more for
dividend purposes than 20oz. even a short distance below
the surface. The Westralian production has increased,
and none of its mines are at any great depth yet—com-
pared to the 3000 ft. sinkings at Bendigo, they are mere
surface scratchings—yet where £77 out of every £lOO
won went in expenses in 1899, £B5 went in 1901. This is
where the joyousness of the shareholder’s prospect comes
in. Unless something is done to reduce the tremendous
waste of money in the London offices, it looks as if there
would soon be nothing at all left for him. The fact that
an increase of nearly £1,000,000 in the gold yield since
’99 has been accompanied by a decrease of nearly
£1,000,000 in dividends accounts for a lot of market
happenings. , * «
Bewick-Moreing condescend to state that con-
tinuation of Perseverance lode in L.V. Oonsols has been
located by bore at 700 ft. level at 370 ft. west from Associ-
ated boundary. Where intersected, lode 3ft. wide, but
poor. Free access to mine not yet allowed, despite chair-
man Govett’s specious promises.

The people who hold the supposed oil-bearing
blocks near the Warren River, W.A., are moving round
as though they meant business. Already bore plant,
capable of drilling to 3300 ft., is on the ground ; and a
Melb. co. is sending another. Also, “ Mr. Rockefeller’s
agent” is said to be on the track. W.A. Govt, geologist
has reported unfavorably : still a bore will provide more
conclusive evidence.
* * * *
From Westralia : Bewick Moreing’s opinion of
Lake View Consols is sobering. It knocks flat the
common notion that lode means ore : “ Average width of
main lode, 30ft. Within it are bodies of high-grade ore ;
but outside these bodies the value is too low ever to be
profitable.” Gf two main bodies the north runs down to
300 ft., the south to 600 ft. ; “ it is claimed that the reserve
blocked out in the bodies is 47,930 tons,” and there may
he a moderate increase of this. In the lower levels there
are “isolated ore bodies”; and vigorous-development
here is recommended, at a cost of £4OOO monthly. A
manager’s estimate of ore available in Westralia Mt. Mor-
gans has-been made. -Between 150 ft. and 400 ft., it is claimed
enough stone can be taken out, without further develop-
ment, to run 60 bead for two years. The lode, from 15ft.
to 30ft. wide, is chiefly sulphide, workable by battery and
cyanide. Averages at different levels run from 17dwt.
to 33dwt., although, as the report on the Lake View
shows, averages of lodes don’t count for much. Mines
Minister Gregory is being viciously pecked at for publish-
ing the Government Geologist’s adverse report on the
Warren oil shows. But the Minister’s position is all
right; if in the interests of promoters, favorable reports are
published (and there has never been any row about that),
in the interests of the public adverse reports should go
in. In the course of this row some nasty things have been
said, among them that the American oil people have
£200,000 to spend in flattening any local oil venture.——
Great Fingall threatens a 12,0000 z. monthly output by
May, though it will hardly do it. Bewick Moreing’s
are bustling at far-out Lawlers. A steam tram-line, seven
miles long, is being laid between the East Murchison
United ana Wahroongah South, mainly to haul the latter’s
stone to the United mill. -In the sausage-shaped bodies
in the Kalgoorlie deep levels diamond-drill prospecting is
worth little. YV here the drill entered Tetley’s lode at the
600 in the Perseverance it showed about 7ft. of 18dwt.
stuff. A few feet south the body was 3ft. and very poor ;
a few feet north there is 10ft., worth 30dwt.
• * • •
Hannan’s Star (W.A.) has leased its mill to
Hannan’s Oroya for six months, and is developing mine
on earnings of mill. Mine has already been horribly mis-
managed, but is in better hands now, and may pay its
way in future. As a div.-earning proposition it is un-
likely to shine, but will add to output of gold, and prove
an asylum of refuge for miners for long to come.
• • * *
Great Boulder South, another mine in same
category, is a Gardner-Lane feline. Was floated sixyears
ago and never justified its existence. At the annual
meeting in December, 1899, shareholders were told that
the Gardner vein, at 368 ft., was 18in. and worth 3oz. ;
still, at a recently-held meeting, the fiction of the
mine being payable was again foisted on share-
holders by the mesmeric Gardner. If six years
unsuccessful mining can’t convince scrippers of the
poor nature of their venture, they must be dense.
At meeting, the astute Frank flourished scrip for 97,000
shares before the audience to prove that he had not
deserted a sinking ship, and said they cost him over
£200,000. As Zeb. Lane and Gardner, vendors of mine,
pocketed 150,000 shares on the deal, readers can draw
their own conclusions as to the cost of Sitting Bull s hold-
ing. ......
Gardner’s adjoining show on south, Boulder
Bonanza, has just got six months’exemption, on plea of
exhaustion of funds and unpayableness of mine. All
Gardner-Lane gold - flotations, including most recent
Anchor Consols and Windsor Consols, but barring Great
Boulder Perseverance, proved absolute failures, and, had
the pair not had luck to secure Perseverance, their re-
putations and their pockets must have suffered severely.
As things are, their one gold-mine has proved their
salvation—in pocket, at least.
* • • *
Once-famous Hannan’s Reward (W.A.) was
recently amalgamated with adjoining Mt. Charlotte,
capital'now being £150,000, in £1 shares. Main North
and South lode on property valueless, but large number
of east and west veins carrying immense bodies of low-
grade ore exist on property, and could supply large
tonnages of, say, Bto lOdwt. dirt. Unless worked on a
very big scale, nothing under 10,000 tons a month, and
with thoroughly modern automatic equipment, instead
of with the antiquated hand-fed 30-head battery now in
use, mine will never pay. New working capital provided is
utterly inadequate to fulfil its mission, and mere chucking
of good money after bad. Would need £lOO,OOO at least
to develop and equip mine on Transvaal scale, so co. will
merely drag along.
• • * •
Boulder Main Reef (W.A.) still disappointing at
depth; nothing of permanent value disclosed, so far, below
600 ft. Boulder gold-chutes apparently peter out, and
become barren or patchy, at or near the Gt. Boulder
boundary, as no mine, either north or south, has come
upon really continuous runs of pay-ore, but merely patches
and dabs calculated to string people on to ruin.
* * * *
Capt. Parkes of Oroya is confident that rich Iron
Duke chute will be located shortly in North drive of 656 ft.
level. Many people on the spot are sceptical of the
chute continuing so far, but, as it has already been
proved to travel without break for above 240 ft. to Oroya
boundary, there seems no reason why it should not
continue further. No break or change of country inter-
venes to disturb the lode. Probably ere this sees print,
something definite will be known. If the thing proves
good a scramble for shares is inevitable as the gold should
provide all working capital necessary.
• * * •
Brown Hill Central (W.A.). an outsider on the
far eastern fringe of the Golden Mile, is working in a half-
hearted way with the proverbial two men and a boy on
more or less broken-up and patchy low-grade lode. Like
all poor mines in the district the B.H.C. makes up in water
what it lacks in gold. Strange freak of nature that, were
it not for wild cats supplying water, all Kalgoorlie gold
producers would be in Queer-st. Most gold producers pay
3s. to ss. per ton treated for water alone. South Kalgurli
even buys water for drilling, as there isn’t a drop in her,
and Ivanhoe buys 40,000 gals. daily from Kalgoorlie
Oonsols at 4s. per 1000 gal., and condenses half that
quantity at heavy further cost. Yet some people
argue that the Coolgardie water scheme is wholly
unnecessary. Even if cost is 10s. instead of, as estimated,
3s. 6d. per 1000 gals., it would be all mopped up with
avidity. Under existing conditions price ranges from 80s.
to 120 s. per 1000 gal. to householders according to season
of year.
J • • * *
Bonnie Charlie, Kanowna (W.A.), again under
exemption. The venture enjoys a very bad reputation,
and has been sacrificed to the greed of .an Eastern
crowd. False reports have been circulated without stint,
and false returns, like that mythical 5700 z. from 57 tons,
have gone round the world’s press without official contra-
diction. Duffer and needless appliances have been
foisted on this co., and recently a mile of second-hand
pipes were laid to a water-shaft providing 2000 gal. daily,
whereas 1500 gal. is needed to treat one ton unless the
water is returnable, for which no provision ; hence failure
is assured. London mine management is rotten enough,
but holy Adelaide can give the Big Smoke points in
helpless imbecility and working rigs.
• • * *
Apropos several things: Hoisting Lake Views
from £5 to £29 by faking the returns from 8 'oooz. to
30,0000 z. per month, and then keeping the returns and
the scrip bubbling up and down is a splendid game for
the man pulling the strings, but very bad for the mine,
and poor sport for shareholders. During the last 38
months the Lake Views have produced an average of well
over 12,0000 z. a month. Suppose this average had been
maintained throughout instead of so flagrantly see-
sawing, how much better would it have been for W.A.
and for the shareholders 1 But then the boodlers would
not have enjoyed the gamble.

Report by engineer John Muir on the trans-
continental railway from Adelaide to Perth, Bi john
Forrest’s other gigantic wild cat, has been laid on the
table of the Senate. The great difficulty in runnin, this
railway, Muir points out, is that of water-supply. The
railway would traverse about 475 miles of country in
W.A. alone which is, to all intents and purposes, water-
less. Of this length, for the first 100 miles water could
be conserved in tanks, using the granite and iron-
stone ridges in the localities as a means of catchment,
but for the remaining 375 miles, in the limestone
country, the porous nature of the soil precluded any
hope of being able to conserve surface supplies. Two
suggestions are made for solving the difficulty—a pipe
line connecting with the Goldfields water-supply (truly a
broken reed to rely on since there is the gravest doubt as
"to whether the water will ever reach Kalgoorlie) ; or
artesian wells en route. Mr. Muir regards the prospects
of wells as very good. If this source of water supply is
available, the cost of the railway from Kalgoorlie to the
S.A. border is set down at £1,732,185. If water can’t
be got from wells the cost would be £2,435,010. The
country passed through Is suitable in some parts for pas-
toral settlement if the water difficulty can be solved. To
the sum as estimated by Mr. Muir has t<s be added the
cost of the South Australian line from the: border to the
existing railway system, making the- total at least
£3,500,000. It doesn’t look as if the .Commonwealth
could afford a luxury of that description—especially in
View of recent tariff alterations. Fofrest is the only
friend that the project is likely to have in the Cabinet. -

H. C. Callahan, ex-manager of the Lake View,
now of Paris, set out lately In a London financial paper to
relieve Westtalian managers of the blame of mismanage*
ment, and to “charge the average board of mining
directors in London with either selfishly or ignorantly
misleading the English public by giving promising and,,
evasive statements, and trying to protect, their owii
hides.” But instead of discussing managements he dives ;
in at once to declare that “ Kalgoorlie mines have bot-
tomed ” —•' an established fact for the past 18 months,” he-
says, “ except as to the Boulder, Horseshoe, and Ivanhoe. u
And he explains: “ Except the three named, the mines
are on the eastern belt, where the gold occurs in deposits
or lenticular belts, in altered (schistose) diorite. At a
depth varying from 100 to 500 ft. the schistose diorite
changes to a hard, blocky diorite, with now and then a
few bunches of schist and calcite seams carrying a few
dwt. of gold.” Cruelly, though, the paper footnotes this
with extracts from a circular, in which the Lake View
directors gave, or purported to give, Callahan’s
expression of “ absolute conviction ” of “ the
permanence of the vein formation," and belief in
highly satisfactory divs. for a long term of years. While
it is probably true that it is harder for ore chutes to live :
in the lower levels, and while they may therefore be more t
irregular (which is a first-class reason for keeping develop- ;
ment works unusually well ahead), it is nevertheless a
fact that the Perseverance has ore at 900 ft., the Kalgurli
at 920 ft., and the L.V. Consols at 1000 ft.—quantities, of
course, not yet defined, though the Kalgurli body runs
to 30ft. wide. But, anyway, this isn’t experience peculiar
to the Kalgoorlie. eastern belt; it is common Australian
experience.

Anything may happen in clays when a row takes ;
place at the annual meeting of the freezingly-respectable
Wallaroo and Moonta Copper Co. Three years ago, :
as the end of the Moonta mine seemed near,
the directors decided to keep away the wolf by
having a “cut” for the Broken Hill lead-smelting
business. They, therefore, spent a lot of money (it isn’t
certain how much) in getting a plant, and then they
spent a lot more money in proving that there were too
many hands milking that cow already (how much they
spent that way is another of the heap of things which
this co. doesn’t tell). Now, when the works are shut up
for good, the freezingly-respectable Chaffey Baker and
other directors are charged with having recklessly
plunged into the business on no better advice than their
own copper-smelting expert could give them. The count,
of heads was against the directors ; but that was soon
reversed on an appeal to the proxies in the directors’ ;!
pockets—the other people, apparently, hadn’t thought of
coming loaded. . i f

It was at the end of October, 1899, that

the war still run side by side. The most disas.

trous bush fires that Australia experienced for
n any years broke out in four States immediately
after the national sin was perpetrated. The
drought, which was bad before, assumed its most
aggravated form during the war period, and all
the prayers of the faithful are of no avail to lift

be another Commonwealth contingent forming
shortly, so you will be able to volunteer.” This
little plan might work harshly in the case of
officers with conscientious objections to farm-
burning. But, alas, though you may find such in
England, even up to the rank of Field-Marshal,
they don’t seem to grow but herb.

There have been some narrow escapes
from revolution in Auckland owing to all the
cohentingents being mobilised and dispatched
from other M.L. cities. Premier Seddon began
to see a shadowy writing on the wall, and averted
the impending doom by letting Auckland have the
North Island battalion of the Ninth Cohentingent
all to itself. The camp was pitched somewhere
out Onehunga way, and passengers on that line
had a rough time. Young fellows, when taking
their best girls out up the line, would suddenly
find the carriage invaded by a uniformed, swag-
gering crowd of blaspheming Boer stickers, who
hugged the girls with a joyful impartiality and
dealt out stoush to any civilian who remonstrated.
Complaints to the police merely resulted in the
civilians being arrested and brought up before the
courts for insulting the King’s uniform, and, even
if they escaped fine, they had to pay the costs of
their defence, after having had their best girls
hugged promiscuously without the slightest satis-
faction. Altogether, Auckland became very
sorry it got any cohentingent at all. The only
bright spot in the spectacle was the common sense
of the police, who, realising that to tackle the
ruffianly soldiers meant black eyes, torn clothes
and damaged ears, promptly jugged the inoffen-
sive civilians. Yet, when these gentry get to
S’Africa the Boer women and girls will, of course,
be as safe in their tender hands as though they
dwelt in castles, with mailed guards sleeping on
their door-mats; and Auckland will be as ready
as any other place to repudiate any German
aspersion to the effect that their behaviour towards
women isn’t that of perfect gentlemen.
An officer of the 3rd battalion of the
Commonwealth contingent describing a pet
private:
He’s not a bad sort. If there’s anything I take a fancy
to he steals it for me.

after that, we always rushed them, and I can tell
yer there uster be a scramble at times over likely-
looking ones—to see who could cut the pants and

The almost forgotten bushranging industry
has made a fresh start in Queensland. The
persons who are the cause of the present
trouble, are described as a family with an old-
established cow-stealing connection in the Mara-
noa district. The men who annex the land that
is underneath the cow always look with reproba-
tion on those who annex the cow that is on top of
the land, and adjacent capitalists were not
friendly with this family. A squatter named
Dalke and a policeman rode a long distance
recently to speak to some of them on the usual
subject of cows, and both have disappeared. It is
known that there was some shooting, and a pool
of blood was found, also two pairs of spurs. That
is all so far, but it is assumed that the cow-stealers
have taken to the bush in the good old style, and
the police are raising great clouds of dust all over
the country in pursuit. It is a miserable region
to go bushranging in—little to eat and not much
to drink, and hardly anything to steal; and it
would pay almost as well to build a bark ketch
and become a pirate on the dry bed of the Paroo
River.

Overcrowding on Victorian railways lead-
ing, to and from suburban resorts on holidays
staggers the capacity of even the sardine simile.
One train corning from Brighton on Easter Mon-
day was so tightly packed that in two carriages the
people could not leave when the doors were
opened at Elinders-street, and had to be dug out,
like figs out of a box, by strenuous porters. On
St. Kilda line a boy was hurt through being
“ crushed ” off his feet and having his head forced
into the lamp aperture.
Frederick Keleher, an unsophisticated
bushman, visited Sydney, and ere going to bed at
night blew out the. gas instead of turning it off.
He was found moribund and soon expired. The
poor fellow’s fate recalls a story suggesting the
advantages of electricity in such cases, “I
couldn’t blow out the light, ” explained thebushman
to his mate—“they’d put it in a blanky bottle.”

bound tram stops,

the women who
fall getting into and out of
trams deserve to fall. In
almost every case the cap-
sized female had waited,
after the tram stopped, to make some
last remarks to Mrs. Jones before
getting in or getting out, and then made
a dash to get out or get in after the
great steam-house had started, and cast
herself headlong.

illustrated. From a S.M. Herald in-

Twelve months have past and gone,
But we remember well the day
That our dear Willy staggered home,
And was then sent away to die.
A dreamy and somewhat weak-sighted St.
Kilda (Vic.) man, who once narrowly escaped a
big difficulty through the usual sweet gazelle, and
is now extremely cautious, got into an empty
carriage at Flinders-st, the other day. Just as
the train was starting, a smart young female
entered and greeted him affectionately. The
veteran promptly skedaddled, although the train
was just moving, and scrambled into the next
compartment. His inward congratulations on a
“ narrow escape ” were somewhat damped by the
subsequent discovery that the lady was his own
grand-daughter. It is she who tells the story.

“ J.” : Up Robertson (N.S.W.) way recently was much
struck with the splendid crop of fruit on the blackberry
vines, which cover tens of acres in that district. Heard
that a local storekeeper had had to refuse an order from a
Sydney jam-firm for 25 tons, as pickers could not be got.
As the work is light, and at the price offered for picking
(3s. per kerosene-tin full), the minimum daily 7s. can
easily be earned, why not have an annual summer out-
ing for the aged and infirm unemployed ?

Something that reminds one of a few bad
old countries is taking place at Broken Hill. A
man who owned, or was reputed to own, many
workmen’s cottages ordered a bailiff’s sale of a
tenant’s goods ; and, whether he knew it or not,
the tenant happened to have been sick —through
lead-poisoning. An angry little crovyd gathered
at the sale ; and within a month three of the cot-
tages were mysteriously burned at different times,
and equally mysterious warnings reached the
people living in the others to shift if they didn’t
want to be roasted. A woman has now been
arrested and charged with arson.

Judge Rogers, at Quarter Sessions, com-
plained that Hyde Park, Sydney, was given over
chiefly to people who “ lolled on the grass”—he
could not understand why the reserve should not
be given up for public purposes— i.e., for the erec-
tion of a noisy, smoky railway-station. Judge
Rogers lives at Burwood, in his own park, so to
say. Let his Honor live in Kent or Sussex street,
and he will not advocate the abolition of Hyde
Park. The Judge’s complaint should have been
directed to the night-hawks who prowl the park
for. lack of a strong park police patrol and 'electric
lighting.

A highly-placed Sydney medico makes
the entirely brilliant suggestion that, as an
improvement to; Sydney’s water-supply, the
old Botany swamps should be utilised as
an emergency reservoir. These swamps are
on _ the borders of a thickly-populated
district, which contains most of the tan-
neries, fellmongeries, bone-mills, wool-scours
and so on of Sydney. Also, the district has a
flourishing sewage-farm, and the swamps are
generally used for watering cattle and swimming
dogs.

At Albert Park, Melb., the other day, a

between two sets of soldiers competing for the
admiration of the same supply of nursery-maids
seems to have been at the bottom of the encoun-

Mysterious are the ways of Sydney’s law-
givers. While every place of amusement in the
city is compelled to close its doors on Good Friday
(unless the “sanctity” of the day is dodged by
giving what is humorously termed a “sacred and
classical concert”) the “Royal Agricultural Society
of N.S.W.’s ” Grand Commonwealth Exhibition —•
less magniloquently known as the “ Agricultural
Show ” —is in full swing. High-falutin talk about
giving an impetus to pastoral and agricultural pur-
suits notwithstanding, this affair is simply a big
“show,” devoted to the vulgar gathering of
shekels, as witness the evening “ musical enter-
tainments.” Further, although under divers pains
and penalties, no one may partake of liquor within
a N.S.W. public-house on Good Friday, every
facility is afforded for getting “drunk on the pre-
mises” at the R. A.S.N.S.W.G.C.E. The way-
back farmers who come to Sydney and call at
the Agricultural Show for enlightenment are
sadly disappointed. It is a tradition that there
are some pumpkins and potatoes shown some-
where, but the show is mostly drapers’shops, wine-
booths, beer-bars, spieling side-shows, horse-
racing, tea exhibitions, and machinery. It is a
humorous kind of affair to get a State subsidy for
its services to the farming and pastoral industry.

cities of Continental Europe, of whose im-

there are basins in hollows in the rocks which, on
any warm afternoon, are crowded with men and
youths in the absolute “ altogether.” The tpp of

doing all right.
Now that Sydney’s “ City Fathers ” have
compelled householders to furnish themselves

Sydney D.T. t’other day printed, with
illustration, a device for electrocuting the bubonio
rat. All firms using electricity could, it said,
have a wire connected with a trap, so arranged
that a rat seizing the bait would get a shock
sufficient to kill. A Sydney electrician once fixed
up a similar trap, but with a much stronger
voltage than would be available in an ordinary
lighting service, Soon a rat came along, and,
after due caution, went for the bait. There was a
shrill squeak, the rat jumped feet into the air, and
then —scurried for his hole. The beggar must
have told all the others, for although many were
seen running round the trap not one would 1 touch
itafterwards. The voltage necessary to kill a human
being, even with special appliances for the proper
transmission of the current, is enormous; . how
much stronger would it need to be in the case of a
rat covered with fur and dirt, both excellent non-

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
M,Dm. 4 »- Sydney, April 8, 1902.
Rain-cloaks, umbrellas, underskirts, open-work
stockings and the most expensive and unservice-
No, it’s not an order-list; it’s a
Band wick memory of the last day’s race-meeting’.
Rain fell in torrents. As one of the jockeys
observed: “It was terrible sloppy overhead ! ”
Rut the meeting was a crowded one. All the
well-known women were present, and if they got
no chance of showing their gowns the afternoon
was one long opportunity to display their shoes
and underskirts. Not, one bad-weather foot-
sheath trod the sodden lawn or waded through
the bridal-veil form ition of water that poured
down the asphalte paths. They were all of the
pump kind, or the fancy shoe in divers fancies.
Some women have twenty pairs of shoes, yet not
one in which they could walk half-a-mile with
ease. As for the artistically-ventilated hose, like
the shoes, prettiness, not utility, is desired. You
can pay as high as £25 per pair for your stockings
now, if you like ;or have it paid for you—if you
like. A Sydney shop has a sample pair at 18
guineas, but no one seems desirous of footing the
bill or them. They are hand-painted with
violets, pink roses and lilies-of-t-he-valley, and, of
course you can’t wash them, and the frescoing
might not stand spraying with formalin—so it is
better not to buy them till the plague is off. The
shopman who showed me the precious pair told
me that I could sew on the jewels for myself.”
? U B rom the depth to which it
had fallen and echoed “ jewels ! ” and he exhibited
tmy paste diamonds which were to be sewn on to
thepetals of the violets scattered over the instep.
Violets gemmed with dew.”
But about those underskirts. They were m all
the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, but
only in a few artistic instances did they match the
wearer s dress. Mr ;. Alison’s was of brown silk
—her frock was brown. Mrs. A. G. Macarthur’s
brown velvet gown displayed a scarlet underdress.
Brown gowns were plentiful, brown birds on hats,
brown furs. Mayoress Hughes (of Sydnev) wore
her reception dress of the day previous and brown
sables. Mrs. Pfaipps-Hornby, the American wife
or the captain of the Pylades, and reputed pos-
sessor of barrels of money, was sensibly attired in
a very coarse navy-blue serge, the kind her
nusband s crew might wear on its day off, with a
storm collar and a magenta hat with a brown
outcrop.
girl with hair to match wore a cape of
Canadia i fox, which, you know, is of a sandy-red
color, like an Irish setter’s coat. At a distance
it looked remarkable, as if her own hair was
draped in a mat around her. Several hats with
sea-gulls upon them were abroad ; the milliners
had faxed the birds with an effort to make them
loox as if taey were enjoying life on the ocean
wave instead of being dead on a hat.
Mayoress Mrs. Tom Hughes held her first
official reception in the Town Hall last week. The
lady can iay the honor to her soul, and keep it
there till some succeeding Mayoress wrests it
from her, that she had the biggest day of its kind
! m record. Three thousand callers shook her
hand, nibbled and sipped at her refreshments, and
overflowed the nail and into the balconies and
listened to the band. It was a well-dressed
assemblage, too, and its collective complexion
looked so good that one sought the cause—and
found it m the light, which filtered through pink
shades. An innovation—these shades—for which
a> were truly thankful. Also, it didn’t look at
all the assemblage that carries off the caterer’s
spoons and glasses—just as mementoes of a happy
dar, you know. Such sentimentalism has been
common at previous first-day Mayoral receptions,
but on this occasion the caterer is not lamenting.

and shiny-faced youths of 19 (there were ever so
many 01 these) were presented as if they were over
30 and had big banking balances. The Hughes
clan is a pretty strong one, and it filled the
Mayoral enclosure, which also seated the
Mayoress’s venerable mother and kept out her
grandsons, one of whom irreverently wore the
Mayor’s cocked hat. Mrs. Hughes’ gown was
mousseline de soie, applique in a lace design over
white silk, a toque of blue and white panne with
The crush was too dense to see callers’
gowns, but the hats viewed from the balcony
made a fine study of broken color. There was
one girl there with one curl falling from behind
one ear, a fashion of the present Queen’s early
pnncesshood, with a revival of which English
papers have threatened us. It was a nice curl, but
you could see by the weareFs agonised expression
of face that it weighed like Ossa on her conscious
soul.
At a local private dance of last week Mrs.
Wills-Allen and Miss Irene Marks wore the
Alexandra curl. Worst of it is that you won’t
get the credit of owning the switch save by right
of purchase.
That idea of the syndicate-hostess, started some
three years ago, is good and economical. A com-
bine of 38 hostess-power entertained 400 guests at
a dance at Paddington Town Hall last week ;
and, although the supper and decorations were
good, the party cannot have lessened the assets of
the givers to any remarkable degree. The 38, who
each invited a certain number of guests, and wore
badges of pink and green, were mostly in the pure
merino style, with a sprinkling of the wives of
fashionable physicians and K.C’s. Twelve debu-
tantes were at this dance added to our over-girled
society set—mostly pretty girls ; but not one of
them came up to the Scotch steamshipman’s
daughter who was present.
The widow’s might. Report tells of the engage-
ment of Mrs. Willie Mitchell to a Captain Fowl;
(awful name !), an English man o’ war, who is
said to be “a bit elderly.” Time was when Mrs.
Mitchell, her gowns, her hats, her style and con-
tempt of convention, were the chief topics of Syd-
ney small talk. Well, a woman with her figure
and drooping eyelids need not be a relict a week
longer than she wishes, and the gallant Fowle will
no doubt prove a kind bird to the smart widow’s
growing and lively boys.
Dr. Clubbe and his white, gold and pink
Mittagong bride were quietly married last Satur-
day at St. Peter’s in Melbourne. Next medical
wedding will be Dr. Tidswell’s on the 17th.
Amongst the passengers outward bound by the
Sonorpa last week was Miss Millie Coffee, a
daughter of the local speculative American,
Frank Coffee of Chatswood. Miss Coffee is a
violiniste of promise, and, after visiting American
kin, goes to some foreign centre where they
worship the Stradivarius, to be trained in the cult
and fulfil her promise. Another outgoer was Dr.
Power of College-street, Sydney, whose wife, a
daughter of the late Mr. W. W. Wardell, designer
of St. Mary’s Cathedral, died awhile ago.
Mrs. C. Martell and her pupils’ elocutionary
recital brought a big audience of fashionable folic
to the Centenary Hall last week. The elocutionist,
who looked very picturesque and girlish, with a
pile of flaxen hair and a pink frock, has some
clever pupils amongst the number who recited
and acted on Thursday night. The programme
was unhackneyed, and Mrs. Martell’s own con-
tributions to it, especially the epilogue to “As
You Like It ” were flatteringly received.”
Sydney women are just now the despair of
their manicurists. The craze for disinfection in
consequence of the plague outbreak leads to the
use of carbolic soaps, to washing witli lysol and
formalin solutions, and so on —all deadly to a soft
skin. After a little formalin, carbolic, or lysol
treatment, the blandest of paws become harsh and
hard. Shaking hands with a dainty hostess now
is like patting a shark on the fin.
Persons who possess specimens of the new
coinage had better not spend them on molasses,
candles and coals, as the issue is likely to be
stopped and they will become curiosities. Ed-
wardus instead, of Eduardus: that W in the
Nmg’s name grits the teeth of cultured England,
and Someone Big has been dismissed over the
coster Latin.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
Amy Castles went away a bashful, brown-
faced, bushy-haired chit, wearing the shortish
skirts and flat hat favored by Bendigo girls till
they attain ‘Sweet and Twenty.’ She has come
back a nice little woman, pleasing to look at,
thanks to glowing cheeks, honest brown eyes,
wavy dark hair, parted demurely in the middle,
and good-humored smile, revealing splendid
teeth. Pity she’s, such a dot of a thing in height,
but sweeping train, steep heels, and piled hair
will add to her apparent height when the time
comes to discard the aspect of little Miss Bendigo,
Home-sweet-homing,’ heart and soul, for that of
a prentice prima donna, in training for the Melba
stakes. As matters stand, the Castles’ figure,
brief though it is, has a finished, pocket-woman-of-
the-world air, thanks to the long, smooth waist of
its owner’s Parisian frock.
“The lesson conveyed by Miss Castles’ tight
frocks should be laid to heart by all short women.
Bocal dressmakers are too fond of decoying
pocicet-charmers into Russian blouses, etc. ‘some-
thing fussy to make more of you, Miss.’ The
little woman, bless her heart ! should aim at
resemolmg a dainty, duodecimo edition, not a
dwarfed, dropsical folio.
~ At the Mayoral welcome, tendered to Amy
Pasties (April 3rd), the guest of the dav wore
grey, the bodice built wholly of grey silk guipure
mounted on silk, big, black-velvet hat, turned up
Irom wearer’s face with chou of velvet loops
softening front tilt of brim, and knot of pale-pink
nestling at side. White gloves completed the
toilette and brought back thoughts of the newly-
discovered Amy, always nervously clutching her
music at chest-level with white-gloved hands. For
at matter, Miss Castles’ manual gestures might
still do with a little Frenchifying.
Amy looked a tame, small sparrow as
she made her triumphal entry, leaning on the arm
of kind little host Gillott. With her came her
young aunt, who shared her sojourn in Europe—a
grey-frocked, pleasant-faced, light-haired girl,
like her niece in features and expression, but
minus, the decided coloring which lights up the
singers appearance. Also in attendance was a
tali young woman with black hair sleeked over
her ears and looped at the back—Rev. Robinson’s
sister. One couldn’t throw a rock in a convent
plavgtound without hitting dozens the very image
° \ les ® two satellites sat by, one looking
meek t other haughty, while speeches all about
little Amy went on and on. The Mayorquavered
his compliments, State-Premier Peacock bawled
iir’ii- eakm babbled harmoniously, and J. C.
Vilhamson, when his chance came, prattled
vitces y ° f t - he gUest J of the da L Australian
chorus-singers, and last, not least, his own
deeds of derring-do in connection with the Castles
campaign Afterwards he strayed to the refresh-
ment-table for sustenance after his oratory, and
browsed with dry lips on a strip of that bright
canary-colored cake caterers are so generous with.
“Everyone was invited to shake hands with
the Castles. As yet she hasn’t learned the vice-
regal, mayoral knack of passing-on strangers
while she pump-handles them. In consequence,
traffic-blocks occur in front of her while gushers
relate that they remember her as ‘quite a wee
thing,’ or that they’re ‘dying to hear her sing.’
“ The Ortona on Tuesday, Ist April, took away,
among other Melb. folk, Mrs. Sutton and her
daughter, Lily. Mr. Sutton, accountant of the
Argus for about half-a-century, and the veteran
of the office, remains behind'. Edith Sutton,
quondam pal of Mrs. Maesraore Morris, is in
London ,writing society pars and running a
milliner’s biz. A son, Jim Sutton, went to
S’Africa in the ante-bellum days, and sent out
some good letters to the Argus ere that kind of
news had become stale by overdoing. He was in
the war, and is now in a Sydney billet.
“Amy Castles was present on Easter Satur-
day night, at ‘A Runaway Girl.’ Between the
acts a frenzied admirer in the gallery called
aloud for ‘ three cheers for Amy Castles,’ winch
everybody arose and gave, Amy herself rising in
the manager’s box, in a pretty, spangly, white
satin frock, mostly hidden in an ugly, useful-
looking grey cloak, her hair arranged in Madonna
bands, much after the style of Fedora Moore’s
inky chevelure on the stage. And the band
played ‘No place like home!’ Judging by the
way it is insisted on as a great virtue in Amy that
she returned home so soon (though, by the way,
Australians are flocking away from their home
just now by shiploads), people seem to be regarding
that popular sentiment, ‘There’s no place like
home,’ as the Red King in ‘ Wonderland ’ did
ham sandwiches. ‘ Nothing like a ham sandwich
when you’re faint! ’ ‘Wouldn’t water be better ?’
asked Alice. ‘I didn’t say there was nothing
better. I said there was nothing like it ! ’
“ Bookfellows, artists and others put in a brisk,
brushed-up appearance at the literary, musical
and circumlocutory shivoo at the Gallery, in
Swanston-street, last Wednesday evening. The
Commonwealth Exes were billed for appearance,
but his Lordship stayed away and the taciturn
Countess, with A.D. C. Duff in tow, moved slowly,
like a big threatening iceberg, around the assem-
blage. President Langton and brother-librarians,
chilled at the very proximity of the Polar attrac-
tion, marshalled the Excellency in with awkward
gait and disconcerted amenities. The slim Earl
would have eased matters wonderfully by his
presence, but, as he was missing, that stiffened
little band of martyrs steered for the platform
and docked the Countess on a State chair in
solitary dignity. They perched themselves around
like so many insulators about a telegraph-post.
The bare back of Mercury in sculptured dignity
rose before the eyes of the Excellency and the
respectable clan of learned brothers. The assem-
bled quests faced Mercury’s front and the dais.
This was a source of comfort to the inartistic, who
see sin in plaster and marble nudities.
“ The Countess was a figure of splendor at this
library junket. She wore black, a severe regal
•black, with a hard handsome bodice border of
coruscating silver applique, and an admission of
coquetry (such is the power of Eve) in a single
blush-pink rose in the left flank of the corsage.
There were many diamonds in the neat veiled-in
black coiffure, and about the unbending neck. A
novelty appeared in a neck band of ‘ Hopetoun ’
Pink ribbon passing through small square hurdles
of diamonds. The ceremony of opening the Loan
Collection of musty and blue-mouldy curios fell to
the Countess, and she did it by rising from her
chair, moving her lips and sitting down again. Per-
haps the Mercury who stood in his proximate cold
altitude heard the words—none in the gathering
did.
“ All the dressing at the conversazione ran to
black and pink, A la Countess, among the dames,
and white and red among those of tenderer years.
There was a wealth and warmth of blonde 'tones
and healthfullness about the second star of the
social realm that night—Lady Hutton. She
moved about with Miss Duff, viewing canvasses
and etchings of the old gallery collection like a
stately ship—probably, too, sighing for the touch
of the Commandant’s hand, and the sound of the
Commandant’s voice—just then being put to some
j n Sydney. A weighty and well-built gown
of black tucked glac& silk was rich enough to pro-
duce a thick layer of cream on the bodice top. It
was a lace and chiffon fold. Diamonds acted as
electric lights on a dark locality. They blazed on
the black, the cream, the neck, the hair. Lady
Hutton is pleasant; her smile comes and goes not
by instigation, but as if evolved from a state of
natural contentment. Miss Duff repeated the
popular tones, black and pink.
“Everyone carried away from the Gallery en-
tertainment copies of prints produced by a creak-
ing rickety old press, treasured by the trustees as
the first ever used in Victoria. They also bore
away very mixed memories of obtrusive Mercury,
of much amateur music, of costly, scarcely-noticed
curios, and a plenteous supper-table. The Library
trustees did things up to the exalted Exes, stan-
dard. Women folk are always glad of the Hope-
touns’ presence; it ensures such vastly superior
refreshments. Life, from our point of view, after
aIJ, depends almost entirely on refreshments.
“Gov. Clarke, with supercilious chin in the air,
and hands clasped behind, delivered a dissertation
on horticulture in general, and the smiling cot-
tage-gardens of Victoria in particular, on Thursday
last, when he was fairly wound up, for the opening
of the Flower and Vegetable Show at the Town
Hall. Flower faddists smiled happily as the
grey Governor (grey in years, dress, and turn of
mind) discoursed on the autumn-tinted subject.
His words come easily, but they are very simple
words. He does not search for an equivalent when
about to repeat himself, nor does he take any of
those picturesque, metaphorical bends that give
so much grace to the Waxellency’s river of speech,
but he gets to the end with easy side-stroke—-
neither breathless nor inflated. Our Gov.
suffers from over. self-consciousness. He sits
down with painstaking primness, then
finds his knees too close together, and
separates them ; then finds his coat-tails in
need of adjustment; then his hands have to be
arranged differently, and so on. Small matters
iike these are but points denoting the mental
Gov. Clarke’s dame is also a grey personage—
very much harmonising with her lord. She never
appears in anything but a grey blend, sometimes
grey and black, again grey and white, but always
grey. At this flower show she sat smiling (in a
grey outfit, a black chiffon and tulle ruff, a steel-
grey toque, and a grey halo of hair) all through
the opening harangue. Her smiling pleasantness
is perhaps a little too prim, too circum-
scribed One would like the wide smile
TO told up again sometimes, or unfold into
a oroad laugh. But she is no end of a help to her
h© sits down, after speechifying she
bends forward with a private word and snnle— a
rescuing hand it is when the proud little man’s
seJt-consciousness is heavy upon him.
. u ‘ booking round the autumn-tinted competition
tables, and long areas of fruit exhibits were manv
big private garden owners, conspicuously Mrs.
Joshua, whose large loose figure was garbed in
a cinnamon-colored outfit.
“ The sensation in matrimonial bookings is
created by the engagement of Miss Evelyn Muret
to one of the wealthy M'Evoy brothers. The fair
JVvelyn has shown a shapely figure and a pair of
very trim limbs in the front rank of ‘ A Runaway
ji lr . ehorus, and has been one of the six dressy
divinities of the Royal Comic Opera Co. for the
past two or three years. She is a merry girl
always smiling at her admirers in the audience,
or in slack moments having a sly chat with her
cnum Jtsdaile—a similar dazzler also on the eve of
engagement of marriage to a medical Johnnie.
William M Evoy is a bachelor who has withstood
to a ripe age the blandishments of Eve. He
has only followed in the footsteps of his
brother, Fred, who married (as a widower), a
year ago, a great beauty—Violet/Daniels— from
the same co. A third brother, Charlie, is a finan-
cier, and is married to a Sassiety lady, who knocks

‘“Sweet and Twenty’s’ first night in Mel-
April) crowded the gallery and fairly
filled the stabs and d.o. The Broughs, who don’t
cater for the roughs, suffer to a certain extent just
because they don’t. Suburbanites know they’ll
meet only well-behaved people whichever part" of
the house they patronise, so they; choose the
cheapest—the gallery. There is no ‘dressing’ in
Sweet and Twenty.’ They’re the sort of people
that must content themselves with ‘clothing.’
' ° n |y ff armeri ts that caught scribe’s eye were
the shabby, shrunk pants worn by Charles Garrv
as the , con vincingly-careworn; elderly parson.
Society scribes are fond of asking why Catholic
clergy, on gala occasions, are so much more
sprucely tailored than their Protestant brethren?
Aisk us something harder ! One’s got a family to
educate, &c. ; t’other has none. Good girl Brenda
Gibson, m washy cream frock, playing the shabby
vicarage piano, with her heart set on the parson’s
prodigal son, called up thoughts of naughty Nell
Gwynne, in pearly satin and gold-tissue, tink-
ling her harpsichord in the ear of a king.
Honor Bound,’ the curtain-raiser, showed
Mrs. Brough in smart, black evening-gown, with
autumn leaves in corsage and diamonds in hair.
A clever contrast was provided by fresh, chubby,
little Miss Chatteris in white satin. A band of
bargoods took up some room in the circle. The
Chieftainess, in black and diamonds, looked thin
but vivacious. Her good man seemed stolid as
that song heroine, who ‘ neither spoke nor wept.’
Other d.c. attractions were Dani and his big,
blonde wife. Chubby ‘Carlo’ had a touch of
rougfe on his cheeks sind more than enough flower
m his coat.
The George Reids and two friends saw the
last sprint of ‘The Amazons’ at the Princess’s.
(April 4). The George perhaps enjoyed the play
m his dreams—for tie slept whenever anything
was happening on the stage; but woke up ‘as
bright as a button ’ When intervals arrived, and
talked till curtain rose again. . Trippers who run
across G;eorgie-Porgie spending his holidays with
his family at the seaside, describe him as the
fondest of fathers. He quite wins the hearts of
young parents by asking interestedly about the
ages of their hopefuls, prior to discussing the
size, sense and weight of his Own youngest child.
“J. Hume Cook, M.H.R., the member for
Brunswick, took unto himself a wife the other
day, in the person of Miss Nellie Maine, an old
playmate. Senator Smith saw the Rep. through
the ordeal with a large, placid smiling urbanity.
Ihe Westrahan is of that oalibre. Rev. Ronald
the red-whiskered rep. in the Federal House for
Albert Park electorate, threw off his every-day
aspect, donned the staid, sacred disguise of the
church dignitary and helped to tie the knot. Mr.
Sachse, M.L.C., a very long-winded State wag,
got someone else to blow for him at the organ as
he pedalled out ‘The Voice that Breathed o’er
Adam and Eve.’
“A difficulty has arisen in connection with the
reception to a certain far-famed star by her old
class-mates. It appears that the said star was a
very boisterous, devil-may-care young person, and
one wild and desperate deed (not parting her hair
properly, or something of that sort) led to her
leaving college. Now, as it is against the rules of
the select seminary to honor a recalcitrant pupil
in any way after she has been at extreme logger-
heads with the authorities, how is it possible, ask
a few sticklers for conservative principles, to
ignore, even after this long period, the school
rules and offer incense and laurel leaves to the
offender ? So the matter hangs while those in the
highways and bye-ways are sniggering softly at
the dilemma and wondering by what Pecksniffian
loophole the organisers can escape the infringe-
ment of their own inviolate rule, and swing the
censer with the rest of the world.

them. .
That was really modest of Cecil Rhodes to

The track of a “disappinted frind ” is
easily discernible in the wail of a Sydney R.C,
organ about the appointment of Mr. Tillett as
N.S.W. Crown-Solicitor. The days of “ Appint
Maloney ” are luckily waning in Sydney. And
if nothing can be charged against Mr. Tillett
but his youth
(he is 35), the
logical conclu-
sion must be
that the office
isoneof dotage
and senile de-
cay.
Above is a sketch made by Fred Leist of Harry
Morant (“The Breaker”), just before the
latter's departure from Sydney. The lines

A death at the house of Mr. Sweetapple, a
robbery from the house of Mr. Redapple, and a

thereto appeared in file daily paper on the same
day.
It is not generally known that Inspector-
General Fosberv, of N.S.W. police, graduated in
the 'Victorian force, which he joined in ’53 as a
mounted cadet. He was afterwards chief clerk in
the Vic. department.
Sydney’s Mayor Hughes deserves credit
for being so far (The Bulletin grows cautious)
about the most energetic and progressive civic
official the city has yet had ; he almost makes one
think that there is hope for an alderman.
William Ohandos Wall, formerly member
for Rylstone, N.S.W., has invented a clothes-
washing machine which he exhibited at the Syd-
ney Easter Show. Mr. Wall is probably the first
politician to wash dirty linen by machinery.
Australian Jingo press disclaims Handcock,
executed in S’Africa, as an Australian. Well, he
was born at Winburndale, near Peel, Bathurst
(N.S. Wales), the ground landlords being the ex-
tremely Jingo Suttor family. Mr. Handcock had
his training for court-martial work as a black-
smith.
The lately-deceased Andrew Clarke, Vic.
Agent-General, was the only son of an Australian
Governor who rose to Ministerial rank in Aus-
tralian politics. His father was Westralian
Governor in 1846. The late Agent-General was
member of the Haines Administration in 1856,
and almost became Premier of Victoria a little
later. ’
The Duke of Leinster narrowly
being fined £lOO in Adelaide last week. He
brought a case of grapes, p icked in vine-leaves,
by the express from Victoria. The Customs
officers confiscated and burnt the fruit, but let the
Duke off the penalty on account of his ignorance
of the law. 8. A. has no phylloxera and does not
want to get any.
Acting-Justice Pring, who sentenced
Lukins to death for the Dulwich Hill (Sydney)
tragedy, may be a practising barrister to-morrow,
a District Court Acting-Judge the day after, and
the day after again an Acting-Supreme Court
Judge. Years ago this rotatory arrangement was
reprobated in N.S.W. Parliament as a vicious
playing with life and death.
Arthur Edwards, organiser of M.L.
Liberal and Labor Federation, just dead, was an
Oxford man, and held a position as a schoolmaters
for 16 years. He was a born organiser, and acted
in that capacity for the Primrose League ere
leaving England. The huge federation, which is
Seddon’s great stand-by, was almost entirely
built up through Edwards’ zeal.
It has long been related of a much-loved,
foreign-born member of an Australian legislature
that he has been seen wearing a tall hat and a
long black coat and trudging behind a plough
drawn by his wife and a cow. The yarn has
become classic, but is probably untrue and
founded on the fact -that the wives of German
farmers often do much field-work.
As to Admiral Moraut’s cabled disavowal
of Lieut. Morant’s paternity, The Bulletin has
received several letters attempting to refute the
Admiral’s statement. But after all what does it
matter? What advantage to anybody if the body
of the son is hung around the neck of one
particular old man ? Morant has been executed.
Is it necessary to also execute his family ?
The farewelling Bishop Goe has given
Melbourne some 15 years of his life. His imme-
diate predecessor, Dr. Moorhouse, gave only ten ;
but Perry, the first Bishop, gave 29. Australia
has had several C E. bishops with long ruling
records. Broughton, the first, reigned for 17
years ; Barker, 28 ; Turner (Grafton), 24 ; Thomas
(Goulburn), 29 ; Tyrell, 32; and Short, 34.
Millionaire Squatter “ Sam ” McCaugliey’s
pet hobby is engineering—sheep-breeding is only
his business. On all his stations there are evidences
of his fad, in well-constructed dams and canals.
He has also invented several useful pastoral
appliances. At Coonong, the big squatter has a
splendidly fitted workshop where he spends his
spare time blacksmithing and carpentering.
N.S.W. Justice M. H. Stephen flatly says
he intends to resign on pension, having now
served his full 15 years. Mr. Stephen, as a pen-
sioner, will doubtless live practically for ever, as
did his father, Sir Alfred, who did not pass out
until long after 90. Justice M- H. Stephen is a
frisky young gentlemen of about 73, who lately
married a charming lady 50 years his junior.
Chief Justice Way is just the same age as
the State in which he resides : on Friday (April
11) he was 66. Gavan Duffy, the knighted “ rebel
to the backbone and spinal marrow ” who draws a
pension of £lOOO a year from the Victorian
Sassenach, will be 86 to day (Saturday). Dr.
Quick, Federal legislator, will be 50 on Monday.
General Booth was 73 years old on Thursday,
April 10.
Lieut. Witton, the man sent to gaol for
life for aiding in the murder of Boer prisoners,
had better stop there, if the evidence of his own

Writing to his brother whilst awaiting trial
It is hard luck for any man who offers his services and
his life to assist to end this war to be tried for his life
when he wipes out a few of these Dutch gentlemen. No

Printed that Samuel Griffith is “ a deter-
mined candidate ” for the Federal Chief Justice-
ship. The “mentioned” candidates number
about a dozen—Griffith, Barton, Wise, Way,
O’Connor, &c., &c., &c. Of the lot, if considera-
tions of personal fitness and Federal gratitude
have their proper weight, R. E. O’Connor should
be chosen. He has the necessary ability, is a
comparatively young man, is a fine lawyer, and of
admirably judicial temperament, and he has been
of most distinguished service to the Federation.
From London Globe : •
An early friend of Charles Dickens has passed away in
the person of Mr. Charles Kent, who was a constant con-
tributor to Household Words and All the Year Round
when Dickens was editor. Mr. Kent was for many years
editor of the old evening newspaper, the Sun. He was
an authority on the life and works of the first Lord
Lytton, and he also edited editions of Lamb and Thomas
Moore. Born in Parramatta in 1823, he was always said
to be the first British subject born in the colony of
N.S.W. His father was a naval officer, and his grand-
father was Captain Kent, R.N., discoverer of the Kent
Islands.
Miss Flora Shaw, the London Times repre-
sentative who visited Australia and championed
the Queensland Kanaka cause, and who seems to
have been thoroughly “in the know” over the
Jameson raid, is going to marry Colonel Lugard,
Governor of Northern Nigeria. For long past
Miss Shaw has occupied the position of colonial
editor of The Times. She is a woman so bright
and charming that one could almost forgive in her
the practical advocacy of slavery and the promo-
tion of war.

R.C. Archbishop O’Reilly (Adelaide) tries
to promote brotherly feeling among his flock by
wearing both a yellow and a green ribbon in his
button-hole on St. Patrick’s day. On the other
hand, a local shepherd, who is a strong Orangeman,
managed to induce a creeper adorning the front of
his town house to blaze out into one great expanse
of yellow on last March 17. The Irish who passed
it tried hard to believe that it was a mere
horticultural accident.
Federal Treasurer Turner’s fall in Collins-
street some time ago has permanently injured
his right hand. In stepping from roadway to
footwalk he missed his footing and fell on his
right arm, tearing the flesh, and twisting the
sinews. For weeks he carried his arm in a sling,
and, during the tariff debates, suffered terrible
agony. The other day when the bandages were
taken off it was found that the little finger and
the middle finger of his right hand were stiff. He
has great difficulty in using a pen, and is now
trying to write with his left hand.
Mr. Hussey Malone Chomley, the retiring
chief of Vic. police, is the last survivor in the
force of the officers’ mess at Eureka Stockade. He
joined as a cadet in ’52 ; others who went in about
the same time were C. 11. Nicholson, the former
Melb. P.M., and Elliott Clark, a happy-go-lucky
young sprig who afterwards adorned the British
baronetcy. The retiring Commissioner climbed
into that position while two of his seniors were
wrangling over its possession. J. B. Patterson
was faced with the alternative of ridding himself
of one or other or fixing up an impossible joiut-
commissionership. He got rid of both.
F. E. Winchcombe, who sits for Ashfield
suburb in N.S.W. State Assembly, now knows
the sort of Parliamentary lackey some consti-
tuents like. Medical advice caused him to shift
his family for 12 months from his constituency.
So he advertised and circularised that during that
time he would be in his Sydney office every day,
Saturdays excepted, and that constituents could
interview him there in business hours and write to
him at Parliament House at all hours, when
“ prompt attention would be accorded.” Yet a
demand has been made on him to retire “in favor
of some gentleman who can reside in our midst ” !
M.L. Native Minister Carroll has done
much hard work lately inducing natives in the
different districts to fall into line with Govt, legis-
lation, and appoint councils to manage their affairs
in lieu of the Maoriland Parliament. At Waioma-
tatini (Poverty Bay) “Jimmy,” in his shirt-
sleeves, haggled with a meeting of 1500 all night
and well on into next morning, and at intervals
for three days afterwards, until he bent the dusky
multitude to his will. Seddon was sent for when
the battle was at its height, and he travelled day
and night to lend moral support to his henchman.
The civilised Carroll acted the thorough Maori
right through, conformed to all requirements of
Maori etiquette, joined in'the tangi of respect to
Ropata’s memory, saluted the chiefs in time-
honored fashion, and took his place amongst them
lying on the floor.

pliments of his church friends in Melbourne, last
week, uttered the right sentiment-in the-right '/
place, as usual. “The kind words to which he

Concerning a lately-deceased mining-
man : ■ ; f :.
James Dick, the Glasgow millionaire, whose demise
was lately cabled, was well-known throughout Aus-
tralia as a successful mining speculator. He did riot
profess to know anything about mining, hut as the result
of good luck he succeeded in gathering piles of “gear”
from that source. He first visited Australia in the early,
days Of Broken Hill and acquired a big holding in the
Proprietary mine, in which, for some time, he was the
largest individual shareholder. He also made successful
deals in Mt. Morgan and Mt. Lyell shares, and was chief
owner of the Scottish Gympie mines. For years he was
interested in Mitchell’s Creek gold mine, Wellington
(N.S.W.) and lately became sole owner. He at once
ordered the dismantling of the old plant—a curious col-
lection of oddities, a general rattletrap and ramshackle
makeshift. To-day the mine has the best equipment of
any gold mine in the State. It is a coincidence that the
day on which the new battery was given its trial run was
that on which Mr. Dick died. A Scotch paper describes
him as “ one of the plainest and pleasantest men that you
could meet on a long summer day.” This is a true bill. A
less ostentatious or better-natured man never breathed. A
stranger meeting him casually would hardly have credited
him with being possessed of a “jingle on a tombstone.”
Writer will never forget his first meeting with Dick at the
Mitchell’s Creek mine. Was told that Dick was in. the
vanner-house. Found a group of men at the end of a
vanner, only one of whom seemed to be doing any work.
This was Dick himself. He was coatless and collarless,
and perspiration was pouring out of him. He was wield-
ing a strongly-heated smoothing-iron and was enveloped
in most evil-smelling fumes arising from a cauldron of
molten matter. He explained that he was giving .Jus.
men a lesson in welding balata belting. The pupils had
the best of that particular job. He was a remarkable
man for a Scotchman in that he had a supreme contempt
for the “ mickle that makes the muckle.” He was keen
when tens of thousands of pounds were involved, bub the
paltry £5 details worried him to irascibility. This is said
to be the reason why the Mitchell’s Creek partners were

“ S’Africa ” : Re proposed Australian ac-
climatisation of the eland. Like most of the
antelope tribe, the eland can get along on about
two drinks a week, but anyone who imagines it
would live in a country too poor for cattle, is mis-
taken, for, in its native regions, it has good
(though sometimes dry) grass all the year round.
If our squatters want to experiment with a new
animal, I would suggest that they should try the

occurs that will fatten on desert dust, and quench

Drought humor from Moree, N.S.W.,
News: —“ Whilst working in our office yesterday
morning we heard a peculiar swishing noise on the
roof of the editorial sanctum. Going outside to
ascertain the cause of this extraordinary occur-
rence, our attention was arrested by the presence
of a peculiar phenomenon in the atmosphere.
Minute streams of water were observed descending
from the sky. We examined some of this mois-
ture and discovered it was almost of the same

nature and quality as that obtained from wells in
this locality. Some of the oldest inhabitants have
diagnosed this phenomenon as ‘Rain,’ and they
inform us that they faintly recollect similar occur-
rences to have taken place in their early history.”

For the benefit of his pray-for-rain people,
Rev. Baden-Powell, M.A., F.R.S., &c., wrote in
1859 :
The very essence of the whole argument is the invari-
able preservation of the principle of order : not neces-
sarily such as we can directly recognise, but the universal
conviction of the unfailing subordination of everything to
some grand principles of law, however imperfectly appre-
hended in our partial conceptions, and the successive
subordination of such laws to others of still higher
generality, to an extent transcending our conceptions,
and constituting the true chain of universal causation
which culminates in the sublime conception of the
Cosmos. It is in immediate connection with this en-
larged view of universal immutable natural order that I
have regarded the narrow notions of those who obscure
the sublime prospect by imagining so unworthy an idea
as that of occasional interruptions in the physical economy
of the world.

“J.C.R.”: There is nothing whatever
theoretic in the proposition of seasons alternating
from north to south successively. The torrid con-
ditions just experienced in Australia followed
upon intense summer heat in the Northern
Hemisphere. And most certainly will the ensuing
winter prove analogous to that at present preva-
lent in Europe—abnormally cold and blusterous.
The 19 years’ cycle theory is but a theory ; and a
long-winded one at that. But that seasons alter-
nate from north to south is a proposition ascer-
tainable by prompt observation. The droughts of
India and Australia have connection, the alterna-
tion being governed by analogous climatic condi-
tions and other physical modifying influences.
Drought in India would probably be followed by
droug it in N. Australia.
“ Long-un ” : S.A. Govt, is at present
very hot on Closer Settlement. It recently bought
53,000 acres (Yongala estate) at 465. an acre,
mostly arable and a fair amount rough pastoral
country. Lessee has to pay 4 per cent, on the
purchase money, and can pay for improvements in
21 annual instalments or in cash. The one-horse
township of Yongala went wild with excitement
during the fortnight occupied in allotting the
lands. The publicans erected huge booths, and
the place swarmed with squatters, thriving far-
mers, poor cookies, and starving, long-bearded
toilers from outside the line of rainfall. What
tales these last had to tell of seven years’ drought
and an average of half-bushel crops, many years’
arrears of rent, subsistence on bread and dripping,
and children walking seven and eight miles to and
from school ! Some of the applicant.:, broke down
completely in describing their woes. A few of
these starvelings were allotted lands at rentals of
£3O to £lOO yearly, and the Almighty only knows
where the money is to come from. Most of these
misguided people are under the impression that
the rents will all be reduced by-and-bye. If so, it
will be at the expense of the taxpayer, and Closer
Settlement will speedily cut its own throat.

The cussedness of Fate ! A grazier in
Merool district (N.S.W.) who had managed to
keep his sheep alive through the drought by cart-
ing water for miles, lost most of them from the
cold caused by the recent rain. Another farmer,
near Temora (N.S.W.), had been in sore straits
for want of water, and just after the rain came his
two-year-old boy fell into a puddle and was
drowned.

“Malle”: “A. 1.8.” (B. 24/8/’01) does
not multiply his bee-nests enough. On the Upper
Murray flats, near Khancobar, I have counted 11
nests within 100yds., on both sides of a straight
three-miles track. Men' were sent out with a
dray , from Towwong station every autumn, and
could always collect enough honey in a couple of
days to last the station-hands for the rest of the
year. From 2cwt. to 3cwt. of strained honey is a
common yield from a nest, and is occasionally
doubled. I believe it would pay to go up with a
turn-out; and,
after procuring
a load, send it
to Sydney or
Melbourne.
Distance from
railway and dif-
ficulty of coun-
try are the only
drawbacks.
“Bob R.” : Immediately after a fall of
rain out-back you will see the sheep standing with
one ear down in an attitude of expectation. Fact
is, they’re listening for the earth to crack, prior
to a blade of grass shooting up ; and, the moment
this appears, they’re on to it. In that God-for-
saken country the poor jumbucks can’t afford to
take any chances.

on the top, is greenish rather than grey, and has
only two notes —“ ting-tong, ” like a small bell—
always goes in mobs, frequents low scrub, mostly
at heads of gullies, and keeps to the same ground
for years. I know one patch in Upper Burra-
gorang where they have remained for the last
seven years. Have never known them to 'tackle

“J.W.C.”: Re color-variety in rabbits
(“Wallah,” B. 24/8/’01). In all country newly
invaded by the pest the only colors met are grey,
and an odd sandy, but where the rabbits are very
numerous white, black-and-white, blue, brindie,
etc., are to be seen. My opinion is that these
variations are due to breeding by immature does,
resulting in deteriorated progeny.

Those Victorian farmers who have been
losing their stock wholesale lately—apparently
through poisoned rabbits or noxious weeds or
something uncertain—have had some plain truth
just handed to them by vet.-surgeon Kendall and
Chief Stock Inspector Weir. After dealing with
the effects of the “disease,” their report gives the
cause :
Soil exhaustion—the first indication of which is the
bone-chewing habit in cattle and wool-eating in sheep.
The next stage is “cripples,” and finally the present
paralytic form. For upwards of 50 years the land, never
very rich, has been robbed of its annual crop of beef,
mutton, dairy produce, or cereals. If the English or
Danish pastures were left without fertilisers for ten years
they would no longer carry stock. The. fact is, stock-
owners have far more land than they can manage, and in
many cases it would be wise to sell half, or more, and
expend all the money in fertilisers and forage crops.

“ Wallaroo ” : The average cockie is either
criminally improvident or beastly mean. Every
year he cultivates just another acre of his already
over-stocked grazing-land, sells every bag of grain
as soon as it is harvested, and never thinks of
growing anything to help his stock through the
winter. Sometimes he even completes the ruin
by “running a few sheep.” Result: a distracted
farmer, who sold at (say) Is. 3d. per bushel,
eager to re-buy at double price, or hiring a
station paddock, about mid-winter, for his ema-
ciated horses to die in. And Brown wonders
why his half-dozen starved cows yield less milk
and butter than Smith’s one well-fed cow. The
cockie never profits by experience.

The Maoriland chestnut about the Dunedin
Chinaman who, in deference to Scottish local
preponderance, took the surname of Macgregor,
is easily beaten by a true story from Oamaru. A
grocery firm, trading as Dooiey and MacTavish,
went bung, and during bankruptcy proceedings
anxious enquiries were made for the mysterious
MacTavish. At length, yielding to entreaties,
Dooley said —“Oi’ll bring him along.” And,
presently, with an introductory “Mr. Dugald
MacTavish, gentlemen!” he led up the donkey
which, hitched to liis senior partner’s vehicle,
performed the daily rounds for orders.
Kava-drinking in Fij is becoming
prosaic. The custom was for natives
to sit round in a circle chewing kava
root. Each individual would then
get up in turn, approach the large
kava bowl in the centre, and
solemnly spit into it. When all
had done this, water was added,
fibre being used as a strainer,
which was manipulated to the
tune of some native lament ; then
the national beverage . was handed
round in a cocoanut bowl, and each
wished each other good luck and long
life in about 2000 words. The usual
custom now is to use a bread-grater to
grind the kava, a tin colander to strain it,
and a pannikin to toss the stuff down. All
the old-time ceremony is dispensed with. Kava
has a peculiar effect. It does not “go to the
head,” but to the legs, so that a man can be
“rollingdrunk ” below, yet quite sober aloft. All
alcoholic drink is forbidden by ordinance to
natives or half-castes.

“Itan ” : It is very rare to meet an abori-
ginal in the Hunter (N.S.W.) valley who knows a
word of the native lingo. Many of them, ill fact,

parts who, week after week, never see a strange
face, whereas the blacks are more inclined to
settle near towns.

“ Elrey ” to “ D.E.R.” (B. 31/8/’01) : I
have seen a ring, as described, made by the W.Q.
aborigines. It was about 50 yards in diameter,
and the ground was slightly raised and quite firm.
I believe the blacks use it secretly for the man-
hood-initiation ordeal. If the youths pass this
they are allowed to come to camp again and take
a wife ; if they do not pass they are put to death.
So at least I was told by an old gin, who further
said that any woman prying into the matter would
be also slain.

“ Picola ” : Statist Coghlan lately pub-
lished some startling figures on the birth-rate of
N.S. W. Where would the figures be without the
prolific dairy-farmer ? The ruling percentage is
only kept at its present mediocre standard by this
vigorous class of the peeple. They can’t afford to
have small families; they want plenty of hands
to work, and they set out to produce them as fast
as Nature will allow. Show me a successful
dairy-farmer, and I will show you the father of a
numerous family ! Within a two-mile radius, of
where I write there are 20 farms, each supporting
a family. Amongst 12 of these families there are
123 children, giving an average of 10. .Maximum
is 15; minimum, 7. The remaining eight farms
are run by young couples, who, however, show
strong indications of at least rivalling the splendid
record of their elder neighbors. What fine,
strapping lads, and strong, hardy, broad-hipped
women they are, too ! There’s nothing anaemic
about your dairy-bred youngster. Moreover, they
are of the sort that stick to the soil as pertinaci-
ously as the soil sticks to some of them.

Biking along a bush road
t’other day I met a wooden-faced youth driving a
pathetically-featured horse incidentally fastened
with fencing-wire, etc., to a disreputable old
shandrydan of a waggonette. The vehicle con-
tained a weird, howling figure, tied flat on its
back with wool-ropes. Asked the driver what on
earth the noisy substance behind him was. He
reined up and calmly replied: “Oh, that’s my
father ! ’E’s bin on a spree at Blanktown for a
week, an’ I’m takin’ ’im ’ome ! Git up, Kate ! ”
Mounted my spinning-Janet and went my way,
praising the Lord that I had no sons to tear me
thus away from my beer.

Tahune Linah tells The Bulletin about a
human ostrich :
Recently saw a “ Dutchman ” sailor bite sections out of
stout tumblers, crunch the glass, and swallow it with
apparent ease. Also saw him light a cigar, and, when
it was fully drawing, inhale the smoke, and then bolt
what remained of burning portion—ashes and all. Am
informed that his favorite delicacy is old clay-pipes,
which he devours with relish. Last Boxing Day he killed
a snake at a Huon port, skinned it, and ate it raw.
When remonstrated with he said, “ Dat is nodings !”
and promptly pouched the skin ! Pact. Says he has
been 12 years at this sort of thing. I cannot understand
how a man can eat glass without injury to his vitals. Saw
this phenomenon myself in a bar do the glass-eating
“ turn ” to convince a bushie who declared that the thing
was impossible. Bushie's comment was —“ You’ll be a
stiff-’un in a month ! I can believe natural things—but
you’re super—blanky—natural 1 ”

“Cecil P.” : How many bushmen know
how to get the sun on a cloudy day? Get into
the open, hold a knife-blade perpendicularly,
touching the thumb-nail, and turn self slowly
round till the blade oasts shadow on (lie nad.
With any idea of time, sufficient gracp of com-
pass-points may be thus obtained to prevent one
from being too badly slewed.
AMONG THE IMMORTALS.
In response niversally-expressed sentiment Herkomer’s unspeakably hideous portrait of the Queen has
been removed from the Victorian National Gallery, and its place is now occupied by Velasquez’s “Bacchus.”
MARIA: “ Well, I don't wonder they didn't like it. Fancy painting the Queen like that!"
BILL: “ That's not the Queen — that's Barton."
“Cric” : How’s this for luck? A good
few years ago, Frank Allan, “ the bowler of a cen-
tury,” was shooting near Warrnambool. Jumping
a fence in pursuit of a bird, he came down with
his boot on the end of a snake, the other end of
which immediately tvvisted round his ankle.
Fearing to look down, he kept on grinding away
with his heel. After a time he mustered up
courage to investigate, and found that it was the
reptile’s head he had pulverised. No more shoot-
ing that day. Made tracks for home and went to
bed.

On either side of the Calliope River, near
Gladstone (Q.), are fixed-up notifications that the
crossing is dangerous if there is more than Sin.
of water on the causeway. Many a poor wretch
has met his doom through neglect of this notice.
The danger is due to an exceptionally strong cur-
rent with a falling tide, and a growth on the
stones that makes them slippery as glass.
Blank, the celebrated Aus-
tralian actor-author-manager,
taking his world-famous original
drama, “ Ashes to Ashes, or the
Bushranger’s Bi’ide,” through
the provinces lately, struck a bad
streak in a Yic. Western dis-
trict township. The second act
of “The Bushranger’sß.” oper.s
in the heart of the Australian
bush as represented by a paint-
ing of a poplar-tree, a number of
boughs, and an invisible laugh-
ing-jackass. The kookaburra
lends local color by laughing
hilariously in the wings imme-
diately the curtain goes up. The
Western district audience had
not been well pleased by Act 1.,
but it cottoned to the kookaburra
right away, and gave his laugh
a tumultuous encore. The bird
smiled loudly again in response
to the pressing public demand,
and the audience was so enrap-
tured by the marvellous fidelity
of the imitation that it continued
encoring for many minutes, ab-
solutely refusing to hear a word
of Blank’s world-famous drama
while the bird-mimic had a grin
left in him. At length in despair
the manager trotted his come-
dian down to the lights, and
introduced him as the clever
impersonator of Australia’s na-
tional bird ; but, unfortunately,
at that moment the real songster
behind pealed forth again, and
Blank was left stammering and
blushing before an uproarious
audience. This was too much
for the celebrated Australian
actor-author-manager, and stand-
ing 0, and shaking his fist con-
vulsively R.U.E., yelled: “Who
the devil’s ticklin’ that blanky
burrd ? ” There was no more of
“The Bushranger’s Bride” that night.

“S.S.” re the employers’ wail as lo the
pernicious effects of Peacock’s Pactories Act on
Victoria’s native industries, and the allegation
that it has drawn all the laborers from the well-
paid, salubrious fields of rural employment to
munificently-rewarded, but unhealthy, factory-
work in the cities :
The employers of the Goulburn Valley have been
loudest in their wail. Some months ago a relative of
mine obtained a promise of a job at a vineyard in that
district. He followed that promise up pertinaciously.
At length he was packed off, at his own expense, not
having dared to ask what the rate of pay would be for
fear of being considered an ingrate and a pro-Boer. He
now finds that the assiduously-pursued billet is worth
10s. a week and plain tucker, and the work is dabbling
painfully and dangerously in caustic soda, cleaning vats ;
but there is a splendid promise of a rise of half-a-crown
when grape-picking begins.

“C.D.P.” : Cow died. I blamed Dailing
pea in imported chaff. On opening carcase found
whole skin of paunch peeled off and hanging in
shreds. Symptoms like arsenic-poisoning, but
test proved otherwise. Also gave my pad one
feed. Result, he became so drowsy that I had to
kick him along the road. Won a two-mile trot
with him same afternoon simply because nothing
would make him “ break.” Stake and bets more
than paid for cow, so can’t grumble. Would like
to hear from some Bulletineers on the subject.

“ Yarrum ” : Was in a shop t’other day
when a decrepit Chinaman came in for tobacco.
It took him minutes to find his solitary sixpence,
which was carefully wrapped in rag after rag, each
dirtier than the next, the shirt from which the
whole was taken being a miracle of filthiness.
Yet some people put money in their mouths !

8. Ritter: “Jingo Jingles ”is the most obvious
label - for much recent verse. The proof is that it
occurred to your painfully commonplace intelligence
J.M.B. ; The Thermopylae was probably the fastest ship
that ever sailed. She ran twice from London to Mel-
bourne in 60 days, about; and once logged 380 miles in
24 hours on a beam wind Emiledam : An amusing
little letter, and nicely scented, but we hardly know how
to drag itin....G: The most pitiful feature of arsonist
M’Namara’s hideous case is that his wife has a profound
belief in his innocence, and regards him as being sent to the
scaffold a wronged man Mungindi : Why not enlist as
a cohentingenter? Anybody can pass muster now ; vou
will be accepted, even if 70 (or 16) years old, and even if
you have double vision, a dropped-wrist, and stone-in-the-
bladder Misco : He didn’t “die for his country he
died for the other fellow’s country, which he was helping
to grab O.E. : The Chronicle is quite wrong. The
Bulletin was not in the least degree angry about the
“birth-stains” message. It rather rejoiced at the gentle
reminder to Toorak and Potts Point, whilst feeling very
sorry for the young man who sent it Ambient :We
don’t believe in Australia so much as all that —not just
now, anyhow.. ..Mosco : You write too much. Send us
an oz. of MS. quarterly, not a ton a week J. Haire (or
Haine, or Home, or Harae, or Haure)—why on earth
don’t you write, at least, 2 words in 1000 legibly ? Even
your name is in this office an undecipherable mystery....
G.A.P. : Dog-lie won’t do O, L. Rivers: Good verses,
but too suggestive of the Song of Solomon. Solomon
could take chances that we can’t afford. Solomon hadn’t,
for instance, todeal with P.-M.-G. Drake M. O. O’H. :
Will print “ Mum.”... Moulamein : Both have merit, but
not enough merit, and the subjects dealt with are very
much worn Alan: Will print “ Garden of my Heart.”
....J.M. : “Waiting for Rain ” hasn’t a hope A.E.L.
(Kensington): Will print Zadig : Will print “Grey
Eyes.” Alfred N. : S.M. Herald might publish it as a
literary curiosity ; in our columns it would be construed
into brutal blasphemy H.T. : Verse skilful, but sub-
jects badly chosen Mabel S. : Some eeriness of effect,
but style slovenly and inadequate Gemini: “Hidden
Rum” will remain hidden. ..." Tutu ” will make par
only Edboi : Very poor work A.E.1.: Rather
feebly handled J.S. :No literary merit Jones : Very
crude and flat MacM. : You splash round splendidly,
but you don’t swim ahead worth a cent Darby: Very
good in its way—sorry not our way C.D.J. : Will
print “ Cockie.” C. P. Mac. : The servant-girl question
will be solved when woman gets to like working for her
fellow-woman instead of for her fellow-man.... .Phorim :
Moral of cabman-talking story in B. before in two lines.
Erip : “ Nil Desperandum” is Longfellow’s “ Psalm
of Life ” over again 6xB: An agreement is quite valid
if sighed by both parties ; a solicitor is not required--the
only use for the solicitor is to ensure that the exact
intentions of the parties are set f0rth...... Tramp:
Ingenious, but not fresh enough Inquisitive : (1)
“Jingo” originated from a popular London music-hall
refrain—
We don’t want to fight, but by Jingo if we do ;
We’ve got the men, we’ve go the ships, we’ve got the
money, too.
(2) No ; the term has been long hackneyed. (3) “ Penal
servitude ” is editing a newspaper ; “ hard labor ” is any-
thing short of that, such as coal-mining or navvying
Taler : Your “ Ocean” rolls on to cast no new thought on
the beach E.G.K. : “The nature of copy most in
demand ”byus ? Good copy, especially relating to Aus-
tralian affairs ; pay for all printed, but it must be well
condensed... .The Angel: One line—•
Now I’m no blooming poet, but I’ll tell you what’s wha,t.
You are right and then wrong.; you can’t tell what’s
what... .M.M. : And if the M.L.A. is a barber, what
then ? If he lathers well and doesn’t blather too much ?
Same remark as to grocer M.P Wells: You mix up
the real and the allegorical; also you mix your images
dreadfully... .J.H. : Your verse isn’t suitable (though
well constructed) and your offer to supply more “ on easy
terms ”is declined with thanks. We’ve never yet bought
poetry on the instalment-plan Wombat: We’d wel-
come a “ humorous plague story,” but yours isn’t up to
specification. “ Constance Clyde ” wrote the only
humorous plague-story we have seen so far
T.S. : But, as Dooley says, “an orator is a boy
orator so long as he’s got a tooth left.”. . ..Sim : A
useful suggestion— on a par .with the proposal that police-
men on duty should fill in time darning There are
some economies which can be bought too deany.. • ;**• • •
Clever, but verse has to be very good indeed to justify
reprinting... .Young ’Un : Exceptionally graceful rhym-
ing is needed to make so familiar a thought acceptable.....
Ambitious : Promising, but not enough in it '
Too trifling....Merlyn : Never before have we had so
much lurid language thrown at us in one lot. surely a
steal from Marie Corelli? Eller: But what is wanted
is to kill the rats, not disperse them K. : Bush-carpen-
ter work too rough.... Chas. M. : All true, but we ve said
it before... ,F.M.: Too many loose adjectives and loose
statements E.E. :No point T.T.K.Y. : Send it ad-
dressed to editor of any one of their papers, or simply to
the firm Timaru : Vambbry, a Hungarian, who was
originally a ladies’ dressmaker, loathes Russia for its help
in suppressing the Hungarian rising in 1849. Since then
he has written constantly in support of Britain on the
ground that it is the only Power strong enough to sup-
press Russia in the East. Vambery has travelled
much in Russian Tartary ; his knowledge of the
British Empire outside England is not large... .Lntre
Nous : See a good local doctor. .E.F.W.: Really, there was
nothing to be said about it... .Justice : There was never
a grain of truth in the statement that Markham would
act as manager of the Australian Eleven. He’s an elderly
cricket enthusiast, and he spent his six months holiday in
chasing Maclaren’s Eleven around Australia. Well 1 it
was a healthful and restful chase, anyhow.. ..M.F.0.:
Your vermin poem came on top of a vermin story. We
object to insect subjects, making exception only in favor
of the plague flea, which can’t be ignored 8.L.:
The reason, of course, is that the working men see hard
times ahead, and are pleased at the prospect of having
the labor-market less congested when the pinch comes
E.J.A. : Not worth print... .Green Leaf : Bear story
funny, but would need re-writing... . Peterkin : Amatory
verse is readable only when it gets outside conventional
lines. Yours is strictly within them.... Wanderer :
“ Idyl ” has a good central idea, but is very faulty in
detail. The other will doubtless appear in due course.
We do not undertake to publish within any particular
time D.W. (Tas.) : Nothing in it Percival 0. C. :
Not worth print... .0.0.0. : “ Bangford’s Conversion
not yet dealt with... .O.P. : Rather smart, but it has no
apropos —no “existence reason.”... .Joseph M. : “As if
the Furries fired the frenzied mass.” The “Fumes ’
can’t ramp around in Bulletin. .. .Jeannie N. : Gospel
truth, but your verse is desperately “ off ”... -Miram :
Idea rather good, but you grievously lack literary skill.
R.O. (8.8. R.) : You write far too much, and would stand a
better chance if you sent a fifth of the amount. Spend
more time in catching bright ideas ; don’t grind out sc
much sausage-verse.... Sandgroper : The Bulletin isn t
in favor of the suppression of nice barmaids. T’other
kind should be prohibited, as calculated to put a man off
his liquor.. ..Ahau : Will possibly use “We Three.”....
Joe Fur : Glimpses of humor ; on the whole, not up.. ..
Blockfeller : Rather wooden... .J.S.G. : Not story enough.
Davie W. : Strained kind of cleverness. Your literary
wheels can be seen “ going round.”.. .. J.H.E. : Not class
enough... .R.R.F. : You begin like a bull and end like a
monkey... .Castor: Main incident would have made a
par.; rest all surplusage.... E.T.A. : The “castigate”
blunder is a chestnut... .Mitta :It jingles all right, but
the meaning is undiscoverable.... W.J.G. : Thanks; but
there’s not much to be done with it.. .. Bando : Lies not
literary enough. We’ve no use for slabs of crude men-
dacity D. R. Over : Your verse is impossible, and the
gags are all either weak or antique.... A. J.K. : But if
you “ don’t value our opinion, ” why ask us, in almost the
next line, for a “candid criticism”? Silvio: Begins
too soon and ends too late. The middle third has all the
essentials of the story... .K. Maidment: Excellent in ils
own way, but quite out of B.’s line... .Simple S. : Well,
either von are amazingly simple, or you’re a very deep
dig indeed—with odds'on the latter! Madge W. •
Weird little warble about nothing in particu'ar..
E. Movrin : There are no such things as “explosive’
bullets small enough to fit a military rifle ; but
in 1898 an expansive bullet (“mark IV.”) was
adopted by the British army, and was used by
Kitchener at the battle of Omdurman. Lots of this
ammunition fell into the hands of the Boers, and was
used by them against the Imperial troops. Also, any
“coated bullet” can be made expansive by nicking
the “coating” at the point Ohas. F. R. : All
very suitable for a kids’ paper Hamer: Neithei
story quite up. Verse, will consider Alma S. : All
well-versed, “December” belated. “After Dinner”
may do.... Sam J. : Item received. Don’t remember
verses Bucolic: Hardly interest enough..
Paul C. : Weakly melodramatic Kiewa: Beneath
criticism Sandy D. : Good yarn in substance,
but would need re-casting... .C.G.IL : Humor too pon-
derous.... Riverina : “Curlew” too like many’ other
camp-fire stories... .N.S. : Crude and stereotyped....
F. : One or two reserved for further consideration, bu,t
on the whole a large, unpromising batch... .H.E. : In-
genious, but Tiie Bulletin takes little stock in riddles.
Try the heavy weeklies... .Ess : Unavailable. Not poetic,
and not even in verse-form.. ..M.S. : “ Sacrifice” is a re-
dressing of a theme which has been worn too thin to
grace any T ordinary dress T.T. : You say all such items
should be put together, so that people who, like yourself,
object to them may at once recognise and avoid them. Bu t
The Bulletin, when it is keen on enforcing an idea, is
addicted to serving it up with every course —putting it
into the soup and mixing it up also with the ice-cream
and the coffee. No good giving people one sudden
dose —you must gradually saturate them A.K.C. :
Controversy on the subject would do no good
Awakimo: Verse of purely local interest.......
G. : “Faded flowers ” too faded : “ The Bond ” not
strong enough : your work is graceful, but lacks sand
J.,: “Two Baits” a squalid item, certainly not an
interesting story Riverina: The makings of a real
good ballad, but strikes us as lifeless at present A
Sad Jack : On to an incident you try to pin a life story
in a couple of hundred words. There are many things
easier than that; try one of them Kiwi : See answer
to J. Mulcahy B. 22/3/’O2 : a German naturalised in M.L.
would be an alien in England M.N. : Doesn’t seem to
get anywhere very definite.... Melita : “Matrimony”
rather flat Sundowner: Old Dad on your farm is a
poor caricature of Dad at Shingle Hut....G. Trinau :
Afraid “Isabel” is a hopeless female... Alma S. : You
are heavily handicapped by your execrable fist. To read
a few pages of your MS. is a half-day’s work Terianca :
Modern Love Idyll a hackneyed idea ; not treated with
any special distinction.... Jimmy S. (Lambton): A good
try, but there’s hardly enough in “ Out of Work.” Try
again—and send us some good mining incidents.. ..Don
Quixote : Don’t —or you’ll be right up against the wind-
mill ! Diana: A very massive and slow-footed goddess
you are !.... Fergus : Tremendous discharge of adjectives,
but the result is no more impressive than a drowned
mouse Bonnet: Got a very large bee in it, apparently.
J.C.K. : Subject needs “ sonorous metal blowing martial
sounds,” and you tootle miserably on a penny trumpet 1.
..Angler: Haven’t hooked us, this time. ..Kiewa : Re-
turned C.11.G. : “My City Girl” for illustration.
Please send address for remittance Weider: Better
not further instruct people how to thieve grog out of
cases... .Dago : Yes, for what we print... .C.M. :To keep
big, heavy, long-haired dogs in places away from the
water in an Australian summer is sheer cruelty. The St.
Bernard will never prosper in this country.... P.J.M. :
Will print “Turned Dog ”.... M.N.M’D. : Bulletin pays
for what it prints B.R B. : Very ancient story ...J.
Louisson : Ditto Matabele : Will use 8.R.8. :
Have shut-down on Kangaroo-drinking subject
Romany: Your style lacks directness and sim-
plicity. Avoid conventional sentimentalisms
Shotam : Yes, reliable mining news very acceptable ;
verse still doesn’t come within cooee of its fine refrain :
“If Britain say not nay.” J.R.R. :In short, Vic. Jingo
Minister M’Lean once sold horses on Queen’s Birthday.
Well, it shows he’s got some horse-sense, anyhow.

What Electricity and
Medicine does for
Brain, Nerve and
Muscle.
Electricity and Medicine,
the judicious use of which
proves a restorative agent
of great power in recreating
healthy conditions in men
and women, is amazing the
medical faculty by its cures.
It has made the names of the
Specialists of the Freeman
and Wallace Electro-Medical
and Surgical Institute famous
over Australasia. It is proved
Electric-Medication, supervised
by skilled Specialists, is sin-
gularly successful in cases
where disease arises from
structural changes of the great
nervous centres, as in paraly-
sis, or other nerve disorders.
Where nerve force or animal
magnetism is lacking, this
new treatment restores. Once
restored, new life Is given.
Disease is driven out of the
system. The Specialists have
attained this end in thousands
of cases, and continue to
brighten homes and lighten
suffering day by day. They
have thousands of testi-
monials from all parts of
Australia to this effect.

stating that for the last two years I have regu-
larly used KUTNOW’S POWDER, with the
result that troublesome and frequent attacks of

REV. J. DENNY writes
“Thank you sincerely for the KUTNOW S
POWDER which I requested you to send me a
short time ago for the use of my wife, who has
been in the habit of taking all sorts of so-called
“ fruit salts,” but which she has now discarded in
favor of your Powder, as she finds it far more
beneficial, without, at the same time, producing
the excoriating effects which she used to experi-
ence from them. I may add that her medical
attendant, a man of considerable practice in
Sydenham, highly approves of her use of your
Powder.
“ (Rev.) J. DENNY (Clerk in Holy Orders),

The Greatest Remedy in the World!
Kutnow’s Powder
Endorsed, used, and prescribed by the most distinguished
Physicians of Great Britain and the Colonies —Sir Andrew
Clark, M.D., Sir Spencer Wells, M.D., Sir Morell Mackenzie,
M.D., Professors Lawson Tait, M.D., B. L. Wyman, M.D.,
I. N. Love, M.D., W. R. Jones, M.D., F. H. Griffin, M.D.,
Julian Altliaus, M.D., George Harley, M.L>., Stanley Rendel,
M.D., and hundreds of others too numerous to mention.
Constantly Used by the Royal Family.
KUTNOW’S POWDER is doubly efficient in Rheumatism and Gout. It dissolves
uric acid and phosphatic sediments as well as other products difficult of elimination, while at the
same time it exerts a moderately stimulant effect upon the renal cells, and thereby facilitates the
swift removal of insoluble materials from the body. Without such actions insoluble sub-
stances will precipitate in the kidneys and bladder. The intense suffering produced by stone, together with
consecutive pyelitis and cystitis, are avoided by prompt elimination. Unquestionably, although the speedy
removal of uric acid and other products of faulty tissue change is of conspicuous benefit, yet to pre-
vent their formation is a service still more important. This service is performed
by KUTNOW’S POWDER when it corrects those digestive failures which are re-
sponsible for the production of deleterious materials. —Vide Medical Record, Sept., 1901 .

One rabid rag threatened Barton with an
adverse R.C. vote at next election for refusing
to treat St. Patrick properly in postal affairs ;
now another rabid rag threatens him with an
adverse Protestant vote for his speech on St.
Patrick’s Day.
Tasmania is rapidly being goaded into
declaring war on the Commonwealth —refused a
paid portfolio in the Ministry; deprived of her
beloved Tattersall; and now her soldier hero
abruptly sacked from the command of the 3rd
battalion Commonwealth contingent!
Emissaries from Sydney and other daily
papers hung about the lobbies of the Federal Par-
liament for weeks “ interviewing ” members about
postage on newspapers, and yet no one had the
courage to hand these sturdy beggars over to the
police for soliciting alms.
The curious news is published that a
“ first batch ” of Australian settlers is leaving for
the New Hebrides to settle on those lands taken
over by the Federal Government from Burns,
Philp, and Co. This seems good enough for
Burns, Philp, and Co., who will carry these people
across, and whose commercial business will be
improved by increased settlement, but where does
Australia come in ? It can’t afford to export able-
bodied taxpayers.
Prime Minister Barton does not get all the
credit he deserves for his fat and fervid loyalty ;
apparently, he protests too much. There are
papers like the Westminster Gazette “jollying”
him mercilessly because, in his assumed ardor and
frantic fictitious Imperialism, he cried out about
Australia not wanting to hear “idle talk of a
general amnesty or a lavish re-stocking of Boer
farms at the expense of loyal citizens.” Really,
this is too bad, considering the difficulty Toby had
in working himself up to some semblance of
patriotic fury.
Altogether six members of the old South
Australian Parliament, which ceases to exist at
the end of March, will be absent from the
election fight in May, but as six members
have been cut off the Council and twelve off
the Assembly, there is still material for
many catastrophes when polling-day comes.
The half-dozen not standing again
are :—Council—Brewer
Smith, who goes to
seethe Coronation,
and auctioneer
Sand ford, wh o
suffers from
“parson’s
throat,’’and has
to nurse his
voiee. Assem-
bly—Hourigan,
who is dead;
Hague, who in-
tends in future
to “ mind his own
business”; and
Jamieson, who has
been balloted-out by
the National Ass
in the interests Of a
stronger man.
Barclay, the erst-
while anti-Jingo M.P.
for Dunedin (M.L.),
has hauled down his
colors. He now de-
clares that, “if the
Empire desires it,” he
t! links a tenth contin-
gent should be sent.
His backing-down at this
latejhour probably means
the ‘end of his political career.
Had he stuck to his guns, he would
in all likelihood have been returned
again at the coming election. The dour
Scots of Dunedin may be Jingoes, but they have
sense enough to appreciate toughness and out-
spoken consistency. Hucheson has always been a
more fearless anti-Jingo than even Barclay ; yet,
at the very height of the M.L. blood-frenzy, he
was-returned for Wellington at the head of the
poll, and will be so returned again this year.
The local clergy barracked pro-Philp for
all they were worth in Charters Towers. Alleged
reason—the moral shortcomings of one of the
Towers members. There is no instance on record
of any Q. sky-pilot ever having denounced a mem-
ber of the Govt. Party for his moral lapses, though
several of the Philpite representatives have truly
fearsome reputations.
The S.A. Jenkins had to throw over two
Ministers, the other day ; and his retention of
Foster, the Works Minister, who howled for the
Snow train grab, instead of O’Loughlin, was a
plain intimation that the more the Laborites
attack him in this election fight the better he will
like it. If Jenkins can’t get an absolute majority
of members, he is done for—the Laborites will go
over to Darling, for sure.
Senator Drake’s new clause in the Public
Service Bill, giving preference in appointments to
the Service of men who had served five years in
the naval or military forces, deserved the fate it
got. It was another indirect attempt to fillip up
militarism. If the Federal Govt, feels justified in
developing militarism let it do it straightly by
direct pay for military services. Then everyone
will know exactly where he is.
According to the Jingo papers, N.S. Wales
M.L. A. Holman’s political light had been quite
extinguished by his opposition to the Gore policy :
it was only a matter of an election and he would
be sent by his constituents to a disgraced private
life. Now Holman has just toured his electorate,
having enthusiastic greetings everywhere, except
at one palpably packed gathering, and the pro-
Gores haven’t the decency to print the facts.
The S.A. Labor party includes old-age
pensions in its programme for the coming State
election, but says nothing about raising the money
to pay them—-and the S.A. Treasury is already
stony-broke without undertaking new liabilities.
It also demands a minimum wage of 7s. a day for
all adults employed by the State or on State con-
tracts, and says nothing about raising the money
to pay for that either. The odium of raising the
money is always left to the other fellow. It is a
dreadful thing to be the other fellow.
Writes “ Up North ” :
The indignation of the Philp Govt, over the conduct of
certain Q. Federal Parliamentarians who travelled on
their passes over the Q. lines to help Q. Democrats during
the late campaign, seems very absurd in face of the fact
that Premier Philp had the front to run a special train
for himself from Brisbane to Rockhampton (cost about
£100), in order that he might deliver a speech of half-an-
hour in favor of G. S. Curtis, the Govt, candidate for
Rockhampton. The Federal reps, cost the country no
additional expense, for special trains were luxuries clean
beyond them. . . . And just fancy the condition of the
country that pays £lOO for the privilege of hearing poor,
hopeless, hapless Bob Philp orate for 30min.! During next
session man after man of Philp’s supporters will probably
rise and denounce the State railway system as a failure,
and wonder why the deuce the Govt, lines don’t pay.
Why, indeed?

HORI (just returned from Maori Council meet-
ing, to Marae): “Kapai Tick Seddon!
Kapai te Tuke! Kill ’em te plurry Poa !”
THE MILITARY VOLCANO.—GREAT WOOLLOOMOOLOO ERUPTION.
Vic. Chief Secretary Trenwith shows a
desire to return to democratic ideals in his pro-
posal to enact the registration of homesteads, so
as to prevent small farmers and tenants of ‘ ‘ work-
men’s homes ” from getting into the clutches of
mortgagees without the knowledge and consent of
their wives. Safe to predict that the aggregation
of mortgagees in the Council of Rich Landlords will
have nothing of Trenwith’s idea, but the Peacock
Govt, cares not a rap what happens to its p 6-
posals so long as it can brag about their mention
in the Governor’s beginning-of-Parliament speech.
The most disappointing feature in the pro-
gramme of S.A. Labor party at the coming elec-
tion is that it demands the reform, instead of the
abolition, of the Upper House—which latter
would be the wisest economy S. A. could adopt.
Besides, the existence of Upper Houses in the
subordinate States of a Federation is a shocking
outrage on Imperial precedent, at which the Tory
Council itself should shudder—either personally
or by deputy. The only other British Federation
is Canada, and of its eight divisions six, including
the principal province (Ontario), have one House
of Legislature only.
The action of the Labor party in wiping off
the tea and kerosene duties has landed S.A. in a
fearful financial mess. There is sure to be a deficit
of from £70,000 to £150,000 at the end of the
official year, fsr the railway revenue has fallen
dreadfully owing to the slump in metals. It is
probably the complicated condition of the Ex-
chequer which has induced Premier Jenkins to
retain the services of Treasurer Butler, who would
otherwise have dropped out of the Ministry when
the reductions came into force on Easter Monday.
Butler is a very whinesome person but he is
supposed to know something about finance.
Tasmania, in its bitterness about the loss
of “Tattersall” and the revenue he brought it,
seems utterly unable to realise that even if the
Federal Govt, hadn’t shut down on him he was
bound to be lost in any case. He only left his old
stand at the Marble Bar, Sydney, and went to
out-of-the-way Brisbane because N.S.W. stopped
his letters. He moved on again to still more out-
of-the-way and inconvenient Hobart because
Queensland stopped his letters, and Victoria and
S.A. refused to deliver them. If the Federal
Govt, decided to deliver Tatt.’s letters that deci-
sion would apply all over the Commonwealth, and
Tatt. would get back to his old Sydney premises,
or some other central spot. Supposing Tasmania
can save Tatt. from extinction by appeal to the
High Court it will lose him and his revenue just
the same. So what is its row about ?
The House of Reps, having, with immense
labor, got through the tariff, it has been re-com-
mitted, and the awful process of going through it
has started over again. Some 77 items are to be
re-considered. The first day three hours were
spent over the duty on socks, and then the item
was postponed to be talked of all over again.
Then cotton piece goods were discussed, the little
gang of Freetrade obstructionists being on their
feet almost all the time. Finally they demanded
an adjournment with the alternative of talking all
night, and nothing was done. Apparently very
little will be done till Pumpkin Smith gets tem-
porary paralysis of the jaw.
The latest move of the nigger-labor party
comes from the Very Far North. The pearl-
shellers of Thursday, that most drunken of islands,
threaten that if they are not allowed to import
nigger labor they will have to remove their head-
quarters to Dutch Papua, and become naturalised
Dutch subjects, drinking on Dutch territory.
And the pearlers talk as if this would be a very
Shocking Calamity indeed. But probably, like a
good many other people, they will think better of
it. In. North Queensland, according to the
colored labor advocate, the white man is a helpless
idiot who can’t do anything without a nigger, and
he carries this theory of the white man’s useless-
ness to such absurd lengths that He makes the
country incredulous as well as tired.
There was much underground engineering
over the recommittal of the salt duties in the
House of Reps. Bonython and Batchelor did the
whipping-up on the side of the Protectionists, and
Pumpkin Smith worked t’other way. The Oppo-
sition talked all day. Early in the evening it
was reported to Reid that a majority had been
assured against the Govt., two members having
been got out of the way. With his eyeglass on
the gallery, Mr. Reid then, instead of going to
a vote, started a yelling denunciation of the
Govt. And while lie was talking the S.A. salt
party was actively at work and nabbed four votes,
and when the division was taken, Yes-No was in
a minority of three ! It is not often that a speech
has sucli a marked effect on a division. George.
Raid converted four members—to the other side.
The Queensland Government proposes to
close up some of its non-paying railway-lines—the
Bowen line (48 miles), Cooktown fine (68 miles),
and the Emerald-Springsure branch (41 miles) are
spoken of as three that are likely to be shut, and
others may follow. These three lines cost
£644,180. No information about the Springsure
branch is available, but the Bowen and Cooktown
lines, in 1900, produced £4llB revenue and cost
£15,871 in working expenses alone, to say nothing
about £24,000 a year or so for interest. They are
both “ permanent and reproductive works ” of a
good many years standing, and though the in-
terest bill will go on there will be a saving of
over £ll,OOO a year to the harassed Philp’s re-
venue by their abandonment. Besides, they
have been neglected and allowed to fall into
decay till there isn’t much left now to abandon.
A return of all the closed-up railways of Australia
will soon be interesting reading.

Mr. PARKS of California Gully, Bendigo,
Victoria, swears that
VITADATIO
has Cured him of
CANCER in the TONGUE.
31/5/’Ol
To Mr. PALMER.—
I, Frederick Parks, of California Gully, near Bendigo,
in the State of Victoria, do solemnly and sincerely declare
that this is my testimonial to you on behalf of my cure.
I have been a sufferer with cancer in the mouth for the
past six years. I went to the hospital, and the first thing
they did was to take the tongue right out. In two
months’ time, after the operation, the cancer grew again;
it got larger than before. The doctors said that nothing
could be done, so I went home and was put to bed. I
asked my wife to get me a bottle of VITADATIO. I took
half-a-bottle that night, and in three days I was able to
take oatmeal and sago, and have had no other medicine
but VITADATIO within my mouth. I can solemnly
declare that the world does not know the power of VITA-
DATIO. lam the only one living out of forty-five cases
of cancer treated last year, and can solemnly swear that
only for VITADATIO I would not be here now, so I think
you can guarantee a cure for cancer, as mine was a very
bad case ; there being no hope, the doctors said, and now
I can take any kind of food the same as before the opera-
tion. And I make this solemn declaration, conscien-
tiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of an
Act of Parliament of Victoria rendering persons making a
false declaration punishable for wilful and corrupt per-
jury.
F. PARKS.
Declared before me, at Bendigo, in the State aforesaid,
this 14th day of May, in the year of our Lord one
thousand nine hundred and one.

Is. bottles. Made in London, *
A Bathurst resident sends this :
Peter J. Handcock, court-martialled and shot with
“ The Breaker,” Morant, was the latter’s antithesis. He
was a fine type of the silent Australian ; essentially a doer,
not a talker. Reared in the bush, after serving his time
(blacksmith) he returned to bush pursuits. Resourceful
and a grafter he was never out of work. Morally and
physically clean-living, careful financially, he was no rude
over-stepper of social conventions. He was a devoted
friend, a fair but bitter enemy. If half the charges urged
against him are true, then war must have created and
fostered a blood-lust and boodle-lust that were ever
absent from his actions in this country. That he ever
initiated an outrage I must doubt, but that, carried away
by the arguments of another (he was too silent to argue)
he may have countenanced, or even assisted, is possible.
If he did so, Peter Handcock would face death with
pleasure rather than go back on that mate, even though
he left a wife and three loved children to mourn him.
Facially, by the way, Handcock bore a startling
likeness to Ketchener.

HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CURE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now' being cured.

HERR RASSMUSSEN (HANS PETER RASMUSSEN),
The Celebrated Danish Botanist,
Proprietor and Discoverer of the World-Famed Alfaline Herbal Remedies,
which have been the means of effecting the most marvellous Cures for Blood,
Skin and Nervous Diseases ever heard of in Australia.
Herr Rassmussen’s
It is about Twenty Years since Herb
Rassmussen introduced his Herbal Remedies
to the Australian Public. At that time
he was only known to the public as a Botanist
pure and simple, having devoted almost his
whole life to the study of that most useful
and interesting branch of science. It how-
ever, soon dawned on Herb Rassmussen that
immense virtues existed in many plants which
were entirely unknown to medical men, and
that it was his duty towards his fellow man
to bring these new discovered Herbal Remedies
within the meaus of suffering humanity.
Herr Rassmussen at once set to work,
and his entire energy was directed towards
extracting the medical properties from all
kiuds of plants, and putting them up in the
most suitable and practical form, according
Australian Career:
to the nature of the complaints which they
had been found a cure for.
Pills and Powders were found to be the
most practical form to administer these new
Herbal Remedies.
It is unnecessary to particularise here the
immense success Herr Rassmussen met with
in his venture twenty years ago ; suffice it to
say that in less than twelve months the
great and wonderful cures brought about by
his Alfaline Herbal Remedies were known
throughout Australia, New Zealand, and many
other parts of the world. Testimonials and
Honors arrived from all parts. Gold Medals
from Paris and other places were awarded, and
Herr Rassmussen’s name has been a house-
hold word ever since.— (Sydney Press.)

“ A.C.H.” (a woman) takes up the cudgels
on behalf of her sex :
Re “ Gumleaf,” on the “ Callousness of Women
(3/8/’O2), the writer draws his conclusions (he is obviously
a man) from the methods of the married slattern
(feminine counterpart of the city-loafer), the baby-farmer
and abortionist —all extreme types. Setting- aside these,
the average mother’s life is a daily round of self-sacrifice,
when she is—as is usual —mother, nurse, housekeeper,
cook, washerwoman and woodchopper combined. When
“ Gumleaf ” says he knows of half-a-dozen who didn t
suckle their babes “ to save their figures,” he is talking
pure bosh. Any woman knows that a nursing mother is
pleasantly redundant in figure, w'hilst the average Austra-
lienne has to have recourse to upholstery. Most mothers
nurse their babies as long as possible—for reasons.
“ Gumleaf ” also speaks of the growing dislike women
have to child-bearing. Well, the ancients, when they
spoke of the pains of hell in that connection, knew' of
what they spoke. And there are the added terrors that
the extra few thousand years of deterioration have effected
in the feminine frame. And it profits them in no way to
add to the population, for, to the moderately-circum-
stanced, every birth means a deprivation of comfort.

at times by severe pains in my chest and
shoulders. These pains not only caused me
intense suffering, but they often kept me from
doing my household work and confined me to
bed. No medicine gave me permanent relief,
and many failures made me despondent, so
when I tried Dr. Morse’s Indian Root pills I
had little hope that they would give me any
great relief; but I can assure you that one
bottle made me feel a different woman. I find
they are a very good pill, acting mildly and
searchingly, benefiting the whole system ; and
I can recommend them to anybody needing such
a medicine. You may make what use you like of
this letter.” Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills are a perfect blood purifier, and a
positive cure for biliousness, indigestion, constipa-
tion, headaches, sallow complexion, liver and
kidney troubles, piles, pimples, boils and
blotches, and for female ailments. Sold by

“Guinleaf” returns to the charge of cal-
lousness against women :
The-assertion that there are thousands of well-cared-
for-lovingly-watched-over babies proves nothing. Women
cannot take credit to themselves for doing their obvious
duty to their offspring, for the brute beasts of creation
also take particularly good care of theirs. Bofling a child
is not the only way in which the callousness of women is
demonstrated. Let “ A Melbourne Mother ” take a stroll
in our parks, and see the flies sucking the eyes out of
scores of babies while the mothers or the nursemaids read
sickly love-stories about ‘ ‘ the nice tall duke with the
flowing black moustache.” Let her go to the railway-
stations on any holiday and see little children being im-
patiently lugged and banged about by women hurrying
off to enjoy themselves at a picnic. I know I shall be
told that “ it is all for the sake of the children,” but it is
a queer way of giving the children a holiday. Then, any
night in the week, women are to be found travelling in
the trams with squalling, coughing infants that ought to
have been in their cots hours before. The mother has
been out gossiping, or to a theatre, and the child can
take its chance of getting its lungs ruined on the home-
ward journey. Again, let “ A Melbourne Mother ” reflect
on the callous treatment of women by women. She might
start with the doings of the Catmittee of Melbourne
Women’s Hospital.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Heavy showers and boisterous weather at Rand-
wick on last day of A.J.O. Autumn meet. A.J.G. Plate
(3m.) was the main thing. Owing to underfoot conditions
the committee extended time limit from 5.45 to 5.55. La
Carabine failed to line up, hut Blue Metal, Haymaker and
Sir Leonard opposed Wakeful, who, at barrier rise, was 6
to 4 on, with Sir Leonard 7to 2 against. Blue Metal made
the pace from flag-fall and kept matters boiling till passing
the sfur. post the last time ; then jock. Barden brought
the favorite to the front, and, giving her her head, let
the little wonder canter home a half-furlong to the good
in the remarkably speedy time of 5 36£. Sir Leonard
tugged fiercely in the rear for perhaps 2m. and sacrificed
much thereby, as evidenced by the failure of his finishing
effort. No 3m. event was ever before won so decisively at
Randwiek. Original time limit was beaten by and
altered time by IS.jSee., consequently the full stake is
available. Wakeful literally lost the field. She was never
credited with owning such staying power, excepting,
perhaps, by those immediately concerned, and Australian
turf records make no mention of a mare who could sprint
and endure so well. The continent’s “best” for 3m. is
Quiver and Wallace’s 5.23 J at Flemington—but comparing
Wakeful's feat with this the state of the going must carry
much weight. The wonder about Mr. McDonald’s mar-
vellous mare is that she is only a handful—little more than
a pony.
* * * *
Seventeen shaped for Second Nursery on last
day of Randwiek meet. Though having to hump 9.7 over
a heavy track, Suivre was rushed and sent out first
favorite at fours, but a 10 to 1 chance (Milner) scored (in
a walk, almost) by 10 lengths. Milner was bred by Mr.
A. E. Thompson, and is by the imported sire, Grafton,
from Loch Lava, by Lochiel from Lava, by Chester from
Etna, by Maribyrnong from The Alpaca—running back to
the mare bred by Mr. Lawson (Mudgee), and said
to have been given by him to his gardener, after-
wards employed by Rev. W. Walker, of Bathurst. Suivre
failed to make any sort of a show at any stage of the
race.
• * • •
Winning sires represented at recent A.J.C.
gathering were topped by Trenton through Wakeful’s
.four triumphs. Then came Grafton with three (Brakpan
two and Milner one), Impetus (Sir Leonard's two wins),
and Russley (Lucknow and Dahomey). Most successful
riders were J. Barden, A. Richardson, W. Bradshaw, and
F. Dunn (three winners each), and F. Kuhn (two). First
batch accounted for half the programme. Wakeful’s
owner (Mr. O. M‘Donald) heads the prize-list, getting
£3373 ; Sir Foote brought “ J. Baron ” £1370 ; then follow
A. Lawrence (£972), A. Wynne (£993), and Kelso (£872).
Unluckiest of ail was Randwiek trainer-owner Wootton,
who, though close up often, failed to score, excepting
with Alannah, and that almost un backed. He was particu-
larly unfortunate in having Acetine so good and so cherry-
ripe to bump up against such a marvel as Wakeful in
Sydney Cup. Had she won, Acetine would have landed
a small fortune for her owner.
* * * •
Presence of Sydney Cup winner Wakeful in
A. J.C. All-aged Stakes (lm.) last week scared everything
but Ferryman, Sir Leonard, and Great Scot. At flag-fall
Wakeful was 4 to 1 on with Sir Leonard next—s to l
against. Race proved a match between the favorites and
they were locked to the distance, but in the finishing
furlong Wakeful shook the other off and won by
lengths, with Ferryman a bad third. Time (1.39 J) was
very speedy—only |sec. slower than the record.
Wakeful didn't shape for subsequent Cumberland Stakes
(2m.) same day, but Sir Leonard did. Five only saddled.
Party behind Sir L. gave out that he was simply going
for the prize, they hadn’t tried him over the distance and
he would carry little, if any, of their coin. Well pre-
served daughter of Carbine (La Carabine) was favorite, 6
to 4 against. Blue Metal made the going merry. Passing
6fur. post La Carabine showed in front and stayed there
round the bend—her ultimate success being uproariously
proclaimed—but there she swung wide, losing lengths, and
Sir Leonard shot up on the rails. Jock Lewis pulled La
Carabine together well and at the distance was with
Blue Metal (who also swerved) just behind Sir Leonard,
whom rider Bradshaw kept going without the
smallest slip and landed winner all out—a neck better
than Blue Metal, with La Carabine a head away. First
half-mile pace was slow but subsequently it became solid
enough for anything. Watch revealed 3.344.
* * * *
Second Steeple at Randwiek, Saturday, was
unsatisfactory. Top-weight (Brokerage) didn’t take any,
and Bay Eagle started hot at 5 to 4, while 2 to 1 was
greedily snapped about Grafter, who turned turtle on
Easter Monday. Race was robbed of all interest at the
outset through A.J.C. officials carelessly leaving a hurdle
in front of the first lep (“ the logs”), which jocks, inter-
preted as meaning that that obstacle was to be ignored.
Underwood, on Grafter, was the first to size things aright,
and, whipping round, cleared the jump 20 lengths ahead
of Sportsman, who negotiated the task a full furlong in
front of Bay Eagle and Oriel. Thence on, only Grafter
and Sportsman were in it. Bay Eagle slipped on the flat
in the second round, and, after being remounted, was
just negotiating the last task when Grafter passed the
post an easy winner from Sportsman.
* • * *
Onkaparinga (S. A.) Races —biggest one-day turf
fixture on the continent—drew 20,000 onlookers Easter
Monday. For the affluent Hurdles Holkar was a strong
first choice, but lightly treated. Lochiel gelding Sydney
sprung a huge surprise and won his first lepping event
after streaking in front all the way. Tote paid £l9 12s.
Melbourne Cup winner Auraria’s first foal—King Edward,
by Bill of Portland—was served up warm for Trial Stakes,
but Broken Hill-Compact colt Mt. Lofty got the money.
Onkaparinga Cup fell to Combat, one of the few of
Carnegie’s get in Australia. Maid of Honor is Combat’s
dam. Great Eastern ’Chase (1100 sovs. added money)
was the best thing of the bill. Ten carried silk. Chelsea
and Sindhis were favorites. Last round Chelsea fell at
the stone wall, and a broken leg necessitated destruction.
Regent and Ronald had the finish between them. A few
strides from the post they were together in a desperate
struggle, which went to Ronald by a neck. Div. was
£l4 17s.
» ( * * *
Stiff running was as glaring as ever at Rand-
wick last meeting, and more so than on suburban or
much-condemned pony courses. Most palpable cases
were some of the later winners, who did wonders com-
pared with efforts during previous days, when the
market indicated that they were not wanted, but too late
to save the bulk of public money. The daring of the
methods adopted evidences that- those closely concerned
are, at any rate, satisfied they run no risk of being car-
peted an inference supported by whispers all too
common—regarding the blinding of official vision.

The big Mo.’s intend having Sydney Tatts. to
themselves henceforth, i.e., unless lesser Mo., of City
Tatts., feels like planking down a cool century for the
privilege of daubing “Member of Tattersalls” on his
satchel, which isn’t likely, as he can do, and is doing, as
well without it. T’other day, big Tatts. held its annual
meeting, and decreed that henceforth entrance-fee for
“ books ” should be £lOO. Previously it was £5O, reduced
from £250, in order to lure members of the smaller insti-
tution over, and at the same time replenish practically
empty coffers. Some came, but, with the cessation of the
first rush, there were no more, and have been none for a
long time, nor was there any apparent possibility of an-
other enrolment—the rest deciding to stick to their own
flourishing concern. This swelling the fee is merely the
assumption of an exclusiveness which is really a necessity.
Water-pond lep at Agri. Society’s Show (brush
hurdle taken away) went to Skylark (Mrs. Elliott up),
with 21ft. lOin. Mrs. Stace, on Darkie, followed, covering
20ft. 7in. With brush hurdle replaced, Skylark improved
to 30ft. 7in. Same naff and rider cleared 31ft. last year.
» • .* ■ •
Golden Gate A.C. was again piebald on Satur-
night, when Albury Clifford and negro Ike Stewart
scrapped for three rounds. Clifford, though clever,
shirks training drudgery and was far from properly fit.
His several victories in England suggest either that he
rose to the occasion there or that Bulldog bruising
material is degenerate. Clifford monkeyed about the
ring a lot with Stewart and landed often, but his punches
lacked thump and might have been mere whisks for all
the concern they' gave the black. White was down twice
unaccountably—-probably to recuperate—and at “ cor-
ners ” for the third round, after being on the floor Isecs.,
was still there, whereupon his s jnds threw in the rag
and the thing was over. Exit Clifford to swell the ever-
increasing crowd of pugilistic not-wanteds.
* * * •
Victorian spider-limbed pug Tim Hegarty went
under a second time in ’Frisco, Feb. 28, at the hands of
Britt, recently seceded from amateurism. Fight lasted
into the eighth round, when Hegarty owned a hatful of
points to the good ; a left hook on the chin dazed him,
and Britt, following up, soon had the Australian slugged
out. Hegarty never was a fighter, only a boxer pure and
simple, and a clever one at that, which is all right in a
gym. or with another of the same kidney.
Melb. pug., Jack M‘Gowan, had a lively time
hunting half-hearted Rocks bruiser. Jack Blackmore,
around Gaiety A.C. 20ft. ring last week. Time after time
Jack swung right or left at vacancy through t’other’s
disinclination to get within range. Wiles and coaxings
availed naught, and when Blackmore did get near enough
accidentally he’d flop on all-fours through sheer nervous-
ness apparently. Once M'Gowan (grown careless and
disgusted) left an wide opening, and Blackmore chipped a
champion hook on the chin with the sinister limb.
M'Gowan sagged and sank amid white-heat excitement
till gong-sound—4see. Subsequently the thing was
devoid of incident. M'Gowan chased and the Sydney
man ran and eluded with dreadful monotony till the 20
rounds’ journey had been negotiated, when referee Daw-
son declared a draw. Decision was unfair. M'Gowan
had won. He wanted to fight all the time and did his
best, but the other fellow simply wouldn’t.

The bruising struggle for alleged Australian
“ fedder” supremacy on Monday night, at Sydney Gaiety
A.C. between Melbourne “ Micko ” Walsh and Sydney
“ Bob ” Turner, was crowded at 10s. and ss. Something
in excess of twice the £l5O purse given must have been
subscribed. Conditions bound both to weigh 9st. Walsh
was 6Jlb. under, but Turner brought the balance to 9.3,
which cost him £25 and left the title out of the
question completely. From first to last it was
the hottest and most vigorous bruising thing seen
here for years. Walsh (5 to 2 on) set a breath-
snatching pace, and sustained it marvellously. Turner’s
response was full of ginger. Excitement was strained
throughout. “ Micko’s ” best work was in-fight-
ing. While Turner clinched, t’other would operate with-
right and left on stomach and ribs as if controlled by a
gas-engine. The crowd hooted this, though it was fair as
could be—rules allow punching with both hands free—
but by-and-bye, when Walsh found Sydney’s crack
warmer than anticipated, he hit foul—very low—often,
and was cautioned at least a dozen times, till referee
Baxter, who had a rough time separating the
pair of bruiser bullpups, disqualified the Melbournian in
the ninth round. Neither could have knocked the other
out (provided condition stuck to both) inside the limit
(20 rounds) and it is hard to say who would have won on
points. Each has only one hand to rave about—Turner the
left, and Walsh the right. Left side of Turner’s body and
that portion over the kidneys were all aglow from Walsh’s
attentions ; Turner must be well ribbed up to have stood
that trouncing. Melbourne confined his operations to
the body mainly, and Sydney indulged mostly in left
jabs to face, with an occasional hook on the ribs. Walsh’s
classic mug was a picture afterwards, and a skin-graze
on the neck (inches wide and long) indicated what the
hugging had been to him. Turner’s showing proved an
eye-opener to at least nine-tenths of the house, who
looked upon t’other man as a “ moral” ; but it bore out
prediction printed herein 5,4/’O2.

Annual N.S.W.-Victorian bowling matches be-
gan in Sydney on Tuesday last week when the first leg of
the rub. was decided. Conditions exacted 25 heads.
N.S.W., though leading by four at the close of the 20th’
was three behind at the finish. Only successful rink on
the vanquished side was Waverley “skips.” Kondio’s
which accumulated 29 to Neill’s 14. Second meeting
(Wednesday) produced close play only through the initial
half hour. After 15 heads N.S.W. was 23 to the good
five later its advantage was 39, and this it hung to
till the last, winning in every rink. Coker’s four had the
biggest surplus (34 to 15) with Kondio’s handy (34 to 18).
The final tussle on St. George green, at Rockdale (Thurs-
day) was sensational. Twentieth head totals gave N.S.W.
a majority of 21, and its prospects looked more than
rosy. Two heads from the finish the home players were
15 to the good but disaster set in subsequently, for in the
next couple of counts over 16 were notched against them
thus leaving the visiting side winners by 1. Towards this
fours captained by Waxman, Hansen, Wood and Neill
(Victoria) scored 5,5, 3, 3 respectively, opposed to Coker
Bradbury, Kondio and Wilkie as named. Until the last
shot (Neills), in the last iink left on the green had
stopped rolling, 90 all seemed sure, for N.S.W. lay two
but Neill’s effort cleverly trailed the jack 2ft. and cut
N.S.W. out of one. In the finishing quintette of heads
Victoria was credited with 32 to 10. Kondio again did
best for N.S.W., gaining 27 to Woods’ 17. Something in
N.S.W. s favor is the fact that the grand total of the
rub: gives it 36 points in excess of the visitors’ com-
pilation. Up to now, of 25 matches contested, Victoria
has succeeded in 16.

• N.S. W.-Q. cricket-match (limited to three days)
m Brisbane last week ended excitingly. N.S.W. having
.8 wickets still good and 127 runs credited, resumed At
8 for 148 N.S.W. skipper closed the innings, leaving O. to
hit up 223 in 3h. 20in. to win. At stumps draw O. had
lost 8 wickets for 206. Chapman (22) and Byrne (20), not
out, added 47 in 21m., and were still going strong
Highest scorers for Q. in the match-Atkins 59 not out
Morgan 42, and Patrick 37—are ex-Sydney men. Sun-
dries totted up 74-N.S.W. 38, and Q. 36—which speaks
some, regarding the quality of wicket-keeping and bowl-
ing. Hoare proved Charlie Gregory’s Mte-noir, as the
Waverley crack was caught off him in each innings
Aboriginals Henry (Q.) and Marsh (N.S.W.) did
of a hair-hoisting character. Henry’s 2 cost 97 runs”
though he made some amends by holding three catches
and fielding well. Marsh bagged 5 for 13], hut was dis-
appointmgf; he was expected to to do a deal better.

Big Tas. cricketer Eady opened out his shoul-
ders and smote the leather with a big smite last and pre-
vious Saturdays. Playing with Break o’ Day against
Clubs for supremacy of South Tas., he piled
up 419 first day and, resuming next week-end, brought
the figures to 566 before getting stumped. What an end-
ing to such an innings 1 This is easily ahead of the best
previous Australian individual score (417 not out) owned
by Worrall. Prior to Eady’s feat the biggest compilation
ever made in Tasmania was li. Burn’s 365. The world’s
record (628) belongs to youthful Collins. Eady’s side
notched 911 against its oppone-ts’ 277, of which one
--(K. Buni)supplied 161. Thj big scorer also distin-
guished himself bowling, gathering in 7 for 87.

liberal discount for natural bias, is that the Kangaroo is
about to get his ‘ narrative ” severely twisted in the maw

I cannot help thinking that English cricket is very near
now the highest pitch it has yet attained. The battino-
unquestionably of “ All England” never was better, and
there is a wide diversity of young and old trundlers on
tap. So send the very best or lose the cinders.

Double Bay (Sydney) sculler Pearce, in his first
match with English crack Barry, last month, started
exceptionally warm in the betting, as much as sto 1
being laid on him. He got to the front early and stayed
there for nearly a mile, when Barry came full of go and
Pearce cracked up badly, leaving the Britisher to paddle
to the finish as he liked.

At last Riverview (Sydney) regatta, the spec-
tacle of big, hairy oarsmen, dressed in a very small allow-
ance of very thin rag, shambling out of their boats on to
a platform, in full view of a crowd of womenfolk, was not
a pleasant one. If rowers must strip themselves practi-
cally stark for the boat, they should at least have the
decency to don an.overcoat or a dressing-gown, or even a
pair of pyjamas, if they have to land and mingle with
women.

Bill Beach, from his Dapto retreat, last week,
made his periodical swoop on N.S.W. Gun Club’s Easter
Gift trophy, which is supposed to carry 100 sovs. added
money. Bill, though the absolute winner, only raked in
£l7 10s. through the “ divy.” system, now so common
among alleged sportsmen who affect pigeon-slaughtering.
Modus is, no matter what the amount offered, to “ cut ”
something each after a few drop out, and then, when
another few go, have a further slice, and so on, till the
last few are shooting for a cheap pot (stated worth of
trophy in Beach’s case was only a tenner) or a paltry few
pounds. There’s no greater sure-thing battler than the
present-day pigeon-shooter as a whole, though, in most
instances, he is particularly well-fixed financially. One
can number genuine sports among these bird-murderers
on the fingers of one hand. Beach ought to have gone
home with the hundred as well as the pot, but they
wouldn’t let him. One or two propose—often beg for —a
division, and the real brand sport doesn’t like to refuse
for fear of being dubbed selfish. Same day, “Kosciusko”
(a leading Sydney photographer) came out well—grassing
40 of 42 fired at from 28yds. and actually closed on double
the money available for the winner by carrying his two
noms. to the last division.

Annual Australian ped. institution—Stawell
(Vic.) A.C. Easter meet —was more successful this year
than ever previously, and brought competitors from all
parts. Entries exceeded prior records and “ gate ” topped
last year’s substantially. Day’s programme, all foot-
running, included 38 events. Winner (Tredennick) of
the big thing (Stawell Easter Gift) is among the greatest
outsiders that have succeeded. At card-call only very
little business was done against, and then more through
the temptation of long odds than aught else. Surviving
the third round, however, made him warm, and then
Tredennick money was fairly plentiful; but the bulk of
backing came from the public and not from the winner’s
party, who are reported to have only scooped £IOO over
and above the prize. Tredennick is a clerk, living at
Malvern (Vic.); he is 27 years old and sft. Bin.
high. His mark was lljyds. and the time put up
for the distance (130yds.) 12 1-5 secs. Stawell Easter
Gift has, since ’BS, only been won three times by men
behind 10yds. Clark (7yds.) was first home in ’B6,
jMurkan Skinner (a big “ Botany” winner) succeeded
in ’B9 off 9yds., while Joy (syds.) secured the money in ’95.

Henry, aboriginal bowler, of Brisbane, is a
slightly larger edition of Marsh, the N.S.W. trundler.
Both take a long, flat-footed run prior to a lightning
delivery. Each bowled the other at recent inter-State
match and gloried in the feat. Henry is far ahead of
Marsh as a batsman.
The latest pair of Queensland bush-
rangers seem to have murdered a policeman and a
squatter, burnt the bodies, and then gathered up
the. ashes into a bag and strapped it across the
policeman’s horse, which they then set adrift.
Either that was done as a hideous act of bravado,
or else the horse bolted with its ghastly burden
while the remains were being carried off for con-
cealment. Among the ashes, bones, teeth and
buttons were found.
The Mayor of Sydney promises to “hit
hard ” in the enforcement of sanitary precautions.
He has already 5000 names down for prosecution
for offences against the health-laws, and expects
to keep a special court very busy for many months.
Fines are to be energetically pressed for, and,
judging from the exemplary penalties (£lO and
£5 mostly, with respective alternatives of eight
and four weeks’ gaol) inflicted in a few prelimi-
nary-canter cases already heard, there will be a
big clean-up when the dirty brigade has been
cyanided.
Of the horrible outraging and murder
of a young girl near Brisbane a Hindu,
who haunted the vicinity for some time pre-
viously and who has now vanished, is suspected.
In an amazingly large proportion of Queensland
crimes a nigger of some kind is suspected, though,
very often, by reason of his close resemblance to
other niggers, he is never identified. On Ist Jan.,
1900 (the latest date for which the Statistics op
Queensland supply information) there were 551
convicted prisoners in Queensland gaols, and of
these 104 were Asiatics or Kanakas. That is to say,
these races form less than 5 per cent, of the popu-
lation and they supply nearly 20 per cent, of the
convicted criminals, which means that they are
about four times as criminal as the white race.
Also only one of these niggers was confined for the
minor offence of drunkenness ; the great bulk were
in for more serious offences.
Mr. Frank Cotton writes :
Editor Bulletin, — I desire to draw the attention of the
heads of the Christian Churches to the recent utterances
of the Premier of Maoriland, who is about Cos attend the
Coronation ceremonies in a representative capacity. Mr.
Seddon declares that there has been too much “ kid-glove
sentimentality ” in the conduct of the S’African War, and
suggests that Maori troops, led by native leaders, should
be given a free-hand in S’Africa, unhampered by the
usages of civilised warfare, for the purpose of forcing the
war to a conclusion. As the representatives of the various
churches throughout. Australasia have at different times
passed resolutions dealing with the S’African War, I
respectfully invite an expression of opinion from them,
in their capacity as moral guardians of the community,
upon the above brutal and infamous proposal.
The Bulletin devoutly hopes to hear of the
parsons holding forth on this next Sunday.

Premier “ Toby ” Barton — easy-going,
fat, gentle, unpractical, drifting “ Toby ’’—has
been invited to England.to drop in at the Corona-
tion and discuss the advisability of the Common-
wealth paying more naval subsidy and contri-
buting in other ways to the defence of the Empire
—also, probably, to consider the advisability of
sacrificing a lot of customs revenue by admitting
British goods at reduced rates. He has been
invited to drop in on Canada as he comes back,
and discuss the advisability of losing a lot more
revenue by admitting Canadian goods at reduced
rates. He has been invited to drop in on Japan
(though there are hopes that he may not go) and
discuss the advisability of losing still more re-
venue by letting Jap. goods in at reduced rates,
and also the advisability of destroying the White
Australia policy by admitting the Jap. himself.
And constant dropping wears away many things;
It would be wise to ask Toby Barton how much
be will take to drop the whole business and stay
at home.
At Hobart town-liall, t’other night, ex-
Premier Braddon alluded to Labor-leader
Watson’s power in the Reps., and, in reply to
interjections, admitted that Watson was “a good
man.” “ But,” he added, “Mr. Watson repre-
sents a party that is inimical to the best interests
of the Commonwealth.” Same old Tory tara-
diddle ; but Braddon repeated it in the manner of
an ancient man trying to voice an almost forgotten
slab of childhood’s catechism. There was no vigor
in the utterance—-it was clear that the veteran felt
half ashamed of returning to the claptrap “ flati-
tudes ” of his political youth. One short year in
Federal politics has taught the wily old warrior
that even a Laborite may be “a good man,” and
that the Tory tradi tions of the house of Braddon
must be kept strictly for private use, in order to
avoid ridicule. Brave old man Braddon is several
milestones past seventy, but if he stays in the
Reps, for another year or so he may yet become
honorary vice-president of a Wharf Laborers
Union. It will be a bit late for him to start on a
career of democratic usefulness, but better late
than never.

George Leake, Westralian Premier, has
been having a high time in Melbourne. He has
been in daily confab with Barton, and some people
connect his visit with approaching changes in the
Federal Ministry. They reason it out thus :—
If Forrest becomes High Commissioner which
the Lord forbid ! —the Ministry will want another
Westralian to fill his place. Leake is Premier at
E resent, and what more likely than that be should
e asked to join ? Leake himself has openly
stated that he did not mean to remain long in
Westralian politics, and hinted that he desired to
go back to his practice as a barrister. But
there is a blemish in Leake’s little story, for he
never had much bar practice. He was Crown
Solicitor—a Public Service job—when Forrest was
supreme. He left the service to go into politics
and become Opposition leader —and he has
been in politics ever since. Leake was a member
of the Federal Convention, and if Barton further
betrays the true interests of Australia by sending
Forrest to London as High Commissioner, more
unlikely things might happen than Leake be-
coming a member of the Federal Government.

West of the Capetown-Mafeking railway lies a
vast stretch of territory which ends at the Atlantic
Ocean or the German frontier. It is sparsely
populated, much of it unexplored, and somewhat
similar to our own Northern Territory. Much of
it is actually within Cape Colony proper, and the
rest is part of the British Bechuanaland Pro-
tectorate. What inhabitants there are are Boers,
and while Ketchener grapples with the elusive
De Wet and De la Rey a handful of farmers have
declared a new republic in this territory, and are
importing arms and ammunition, and Ketchener
hasn’t a man to send against them. _ This has
been going on for some time. The idea of the
Boers actually founding a new republic in British
territory is a strange upending of things.

Concerning the election of a successor to
the late Mr. Piesse, M.H.R.: —
The Tas. mining centres went almost solid for Laborist
Whitelaw, at the recent Federal bye-election ; though
the Tatters-all Govt, crowd sent the weightiest emis-
saries it could find to try and seduce the miners. But
the one-horse villages of the interior were just as unani-
mous for the Tory Hartnoll, and crushed the progressive
miners by sheer weight of accumulated fossil. Generally
stated throughout Tas. that the Tattersi.ll contingent
spent £3000 over the election. Three Senators (M'Gregor,
O’Keefe, and Stewart) voyaged to Tasmania at the last
moment to give the Laborite a lift. They helped him
undoubtedly, but this jumping into a fray at the last
moment is not good business in a place like Tasmania.
O’Malley knew' his people, and put in solid months at
steady organisation work ere asking them to vote. He
won. The Tas. electors are no less amenable to demo-
cratic reason than those of other States, but they mustn’t
be rushed.

HAIL TO MEN
Even unto old age you may feel
the vigor of youth, with its light
heart, elastic step, courage and
tireless energy. You may be free from
pains and aches and defy your years.
There is a fountain of perpetual youth, and you have only to reach out your hand
and take it. You can drink of it until your heart shouts with gladness, and with all
your might you will proclaim, as other men have,
“I AM A MAN ! ”
Like the vigorous giants of old, you can be in your prime at sixty—strong, vigorous
and full of youthful enthusiasm.
Mr. John G-eddes, Liverpool, N.S.W., says :— “I am an old man and did not expect much, but
lam very well satisfied. Your splendid Belt has removed the pain from my back and legs.”
If you feel young, you are young. Youth is strength. If you have strength you
can defy your years.
Our Electric Belt will warm your heart and fill your body with the fire of youth. It
will limber your joints and put springs in your legs. It will make you feel glad with the
joys of youthful vigor.
Mr. J. Dixon, Bendemere, N.S.W., writes : —“ lam 72 years old, and had a bad back for a long
time. I was also weary upon arisingin the morning. Now my back is strong and lam right as rain.”
Isn’t that food for sceptics? Such letters as we receive would conv.ert even a
bigoted old-school doctor, and he can see no good in anything but physic.
Give us a man with pains in his back, a dull ache in his muscles or joints,
“come-and-go ” pains in his shoulders, chest and sides, Sciatica in his hip, Lumbago, Rheumatism, or any ache or pain,
and our Belt will pour the oil of life into his aching body and drive out every sign of pain. No pain can exist where our
Belt is worn.
William Clouten, Mountinghome Steed, Marlinville, N.S.W., writes l was a walking death, a veritable walking misery, before
I got your Belt. I thank God I came to you. My legs and back are all right now, and I feel better through my whole body.”
They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet in the country which has not cures by
Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt.
It’s as good for women as for men. Worn while you sleep, it causes no trouble. You feel the gentle, glowing heat
from it constantly, but no sting, no burning, as in old-style belts.
Call to-day, or send for our beautiful book, full of the things a man likes to read if he wants to be a strong man.

Languid
Condition
“ Doctor said there was one thing
which might do me good —Scott’s
Emulsion ”
Life has a poor lookout when you are too
languid to do anything —too languid even to
wish to do anything ! Such a condition is
usually a legacy from anaemia, and if not
corrected leads to disaster. Here is the
story of disaster averted :
“ 29, George How, Dockhead,
“ London, England, June 10th, 1901.
“ Dear Sirs,—Last autumn I suffered very
badly from the effects of anaemia, which was
followed by lung trouble, and I got into a
very weak and languid condition. It was
positively too much trouble for me to do any-
thing, as I could not exert myself in the
least. I had to take to my bed; yet I did
not make the slightest progress. In October
my doctor said there was one thing which
K
YM
il i\V «\
\\V\ \'
MISS N. BOOTH.
(From a photograph.)
might do me good, and that was Scott’s
Emulsion. I acted upon his advice, gave
the preparation a fair trial, and am heartily
glad to be able to say the results have been
most satisfactory, for Scott’s Emulsion was
successful where everything else had failed.
I can truly say that I never felt so well as
I do now, and I cannot help thinking Scott’s
Emulsion has been the means of saving my
life. I consider your preparation a wonder-
fully strengthening and invigorating remedy,
and would certainly advise all suffering from
chest and lung troubles to give it a trial.
“ Yours truly,
“(Signed) (Miss) N. Booth.”
Miss Booth’s story is a story often told by
those who write to us—that a doctor pre-
scribed Scott’s Emulsion. He could, of
course, had he thought wise, have prescribed
plain cod-liver oil, or any of the many sub-
stitutes and imitations of Scott’s Emulsion.
But he did not; he told Miss 80. th that
there was one thing which might do her
good—Scott’s Emulsion.
The doctor, like doctors everywhere who
prescribe Scott’s Emulsion, had the best of
reasons for prescribing this remedy, because
Scott’s Emulsion is the highest and most
valuable form in which cod-liver oil is to bo
obtained nowadays. Thousands of doctors
admit this. Then, additionally, all the nasty
taste and smell of cod-liver oil is eliminated
by the Scott & Bowne process, and the
virtues of cod-liver oil are reinforced with
hypophosphites of lime and soda, the first of
the bone and tissue builders.
If you are languid, anaemic, listless, and
without strength to meet the round of daily
cares, take Scott's Emulsion, and you will
be quickly cured. But you must remember
what the doctor advised Miss Booth : that
there is “ one thing—Scott’s Emulsion
that will help in such cases.
To secure the relief Miss Booth had, see
that on the wrapper of the bottle there is a,
picture of a man carrying a big codfish ; if
they are there you have Scott’s Emulsion.
You can obtain a sample of Scott’s Emulsion
by sending fourpence to Scott and Bowne,
483 Kent street, Sydney, and mentioning this
paper. All chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.

PURVEYORS BY SPECIAL APPOINTMENT TO HIS MAJESTY THE KING.
At Poverty Point.
A business-man in a Vic. town rented a room adjoining
his premises to a showman, who exhibited a monster
shark. Summer weather does not improve dead shark,
and on the fourth day the exhibitor levanted with his
takings, leaving the exhibit as security for the rent. Ke-
moval and burial of the shark cost the business-man A.l.
A friend to whom he lamented his loss told him that, it
he had removed the shark’s teeth before burying it, the
proceeds would have paid all expenses and left a margin
of profit. Taking the hint, the business-man paid 109.
more to have the shark exhumed, and found that tne
showman had removed the teeth before leaving. Next
“ shark ” exhibitor who comes to that town will have to
pay rent “ strictly in advance,” and give security for re-
moval of exhibit when over-ripe.
The Italian opera-singers had some peculiar little
ways about them. One of them nearly died of shock
through the recklessness of the little Australienne who
was house-keeping for him. The singer would arrive home
about midnight, and after vin ordinaire, maccarom, and
ze pea-nut, would put the light put while he removed his
valuable gems and placed them in safety. Even his tempo-
rary spouse never knew where he concealed the jewellery,
till she found out accidentally one morning. They
slept in a top back room, and when an inebriated and
playful couple and several musically-inclined cats roused
the echoes of the night, the little Australienne arose in
indignation and reached excitedly for something to
throw out, by way of a hint. The singer sprang
from his couch and reminded her the wine-bottle was
not empty, and begged her to throw something belonging
to the landlady. Disregarding his entreaties, she heaved
the first thing her hand touched, and it was the Italian
gentleman’s boot. It crashed down into the lane, the
cats fled, the two drunks, firmly believing the sky had
fallen, crept silently away, and the neighbors lay and
shivered with apprehension. In the morning the singer
arose and noticed, with a scream of horror, that one of
his boots was missing. His wife saw him clutch the tmng
and dive one fat, flabby paw into the interior, and with-
draw it with a cry of despair. Then he shot through the
door, she heard him falling downstairs, heard the back
gate wrenched off its hinges, and presently he came
back, laughing, crying, and doing several other things at
the same time, and nursing his beloved boot, from which
he extracted the sock and then shook out his jewellery.
It was his safe-deposit.
“ V.” : It was in the gallery, at “ Boheme.’ Just
in front of us were several Dagos, who rose excitedly
during the second act to cry “ Brava !” to Dam. They
remained standing and obstructing our stage view. An
emphatic request made them all sit down again, except
one man, who took no notice. We levelled sarcasm at
the offender. We called him “Signor Peanuto, and
requested him to be seated. He disregarded our petition.
We called him “ largera plata,” ‘ ‘ stele o’ the ovst, * iji-
a-banan,” and several other Dago expressions, without
avail. We called him “Vesuvius” and ‘ Julius Oaisar.
A riot was narrowly averted (they always are) by the
opaque one turning slowly round and remarking, quietly,
“ Oh, go to ’ell !” He was an Australian. We
might have guessed it.
From a South African correspondent: “ Miss Annie
Mavor, well known to Australians, is doing well in Natal
and Cape Colony with a repertoire similar to Nance
O’Neil’s. Nance O’Neil was to open at Mantzburg on
Jan. 13th. She leaves Natal for Egypt and London—
appearing at the Lyceum. Thomas Kingston is down
with enteric fever, which is having a good innings here
just now.”
The trial in which Wallace Brownlow got a verdict for
£1282 against the management of a Vic. hotel for having
left unlocked a dangerous door through which he fell,
added a phrase to the literature of drink. Mr. Brownlow,
according to one witness, has a pet name for a long
whiskj’ ” —“ a good rozzler.” The baritone established it
as a fact, however, that he didn’t rozzle-dozzle to a
muddling extent, either as a habit or on the day of the
accident. He might have called many more witnesses
than Henry Bracy to prove that his voice was seriously
affected by the accident.
With the World’s Entertainers at Sydney Palace is Mr.
Rodney, a singer and patter comedian. His talk is
amusing enough, but he makes the awful mistake of
singing two inane Jingo ditties for the musical part of
his turn ; at which the gallery eats apples and the d.c.
yawns. Theatre Jingoism is a year or more out of date
in Australia.
Imported soloists—tenors, sopranos, baritones—are now
features of both the Sydney music halls. Seeing that
Australia is just now a big exporter of song-birds and
local people could be easily got to surpass most of the
imported vocalists, it seems bad business to bring them
all the way from America.
“A.M.” : In “The Wrong Mr. Wright,” at Melbourne
Biiou, Miss Barton has a good part, and makes fair use of
her opportunities. She looks tail* graceful and extremely
decorative, except when trying too hard to be sinuous.
Holding a blotting-pad up to a mirror to spy on its im-
pressions, she sticks her head forward like a goose.
Sydney girls on the boards seem addicted to these Sara
Bernhardt, Brown Potter, serpentine, eelish, wrigglesome
attitudes. Inez Bensusan at times stretches her neck
forward and squirms as if bent on worming her way head-
foremost out of her clothes. There was a time when
Melbourne stage-neophytes mostly blinked their eyes and
pursed their lips, ala Nellie Stewart. Rose Musgrove
still shows a trace of that habit. Now, local beginners
keep in mind Nance O’Neil—bent forward in her chair,
hands clasped round knees, eyes glued to an imaginary
fat pittite in the far beyond—that was Nance’s patent
“ lion-about-to-spring ” posture. Others reproduce Lillah
M'Oarthy, with her elbow propped on the table. To this
cult belonged the young thing who did Lady Olivia
Vernon in “ Sweet Nell.”
The cast of the latest comedy at Daly’s Theatre,
London, includes four people affectionately remembered
by old Australian playgoers, viz., Fred. Kaye and Mrs.
Edmund Phelps, of the “ Gaiety Girl co. ; Miss Beryl
Faber who was second lady in the last of the Brough and
Boucicault companies ; and Willie Warde, who figured as
the nimble kneebone in their original production of the
“Little Jack Sheppard” burlesque when B. and B. were
novices at management. Willie Warde returned to
England at about the time of Cecil Wards arrival in
A new farcical comedv by “ Owen Hall,” the author of
“ Florodora,” is titled “ The Girl from Jay’s,’ said Jay s
b ing a vast London drapery-shop where all the moneyed
widows and orphanesses buy their trappings of woe.
Interesting to know how much Owen Hall (real name
Davis) got for the advt. Also, the results of this new
departure will be interesting. There are tailors, grocers,
hosiers, ironmongers, and milliners in London who would
gladly pay £5OO or £lOOO to any well-known play wright
for an advt. of that sort. And the author m selling the
American and Australian rights, would naturally sell the
extra right of localising the title of his play. _ The Girl
from Jay’s ” might be changed to The Girl from s
in Sydney and Melbourne. __

A Lesson Worth Learning 1 .
The Caee of
Mr. D. LEACH.
(BY A NEWCASTLE REPORTER.)
Tho work of the press is usually of in-
finite public benefit in its immediate re-
buts, as it paves the way for all those bene-
ficent reforms to which all progressive
people are aspiring. Complete evidence was
lately obtained Ly a reporter from Mr.
J amel Leach, of Downie-street, Smedmore,
Newcastle, to justify the above opinion, but
to those to whom the subject is unfamiliar a
perusal of the-Words of Mr. Leach is re-
spectfully commended.
„ “ W he .“ 1 lef t Ratcliffe,” said Mr. Leach,
which is a small town about seven miles
from Manchester, I came straight to New-
castle and have been working'there ever
since, which embraces a period of a dozen
years Three years prior to that I was in a
very bad state of health, my internal organs
being so much upset after an accident in
which my shoulder bone was broken that I
could not get my food to agreed with me
I suffered from a sluggish liver, it was evi-
dent, and the drowsiness which came over
me after meals was distressing ”
‘ ‘ u hafc sor t of an appetite did you have ? ”
en pared the reporter. j
“Avery fickle one. Some days I felt
hungry and so.. e days I had no appetite at
all. When I had eaten freely my stomach
became bloated out, and I felt considerable
pain as if the food was fermenting. If I ate
but very little the same unpleasantness was
experienced, so it was quite plain that in-
digestion was one of my ailments. I becaane
so melancholy that I lost all interest and
pleasure in life, and the awful depression in
my spirits was even worse when I got up to
work in the mornings, as my loss of energy
.vas so great that I felt thoioughly incap-
able of lasting the days out. livery evening
I returned home feeling very weary and
fagged out, there not being a drain of
vitality left in my system; but the curious
part of it was that I could not sleep when I
went to bed. My brain was never at rest,
as I started thinking directly my head
touched the pillow, and as the hours
dragged slowly along my misery increased,
for when the clock pointed to the hour to
arise my limbs were aching intensely, and I
aas almost too exhausted to get up. The
only variety I had was by occasionally fall-
ing asleep for a little time, and then the
most unhappy dreams came to my mind and
woke me abruptly £ My tongue was as dry
as a piece of voo.t, and I also had a foul
taste in the mouth. A fearful pain in my
chest came after I had eaten a little food,
and those pains went right through to the
back and hurt me between the shoulders.
Sometimes there was a sinking sensation in
my stomach as if I were on the point of
starvation, but when food was placed before
mel sickened at the sight of it. I lingered on
like this irom w. ek to week, suffering acutely
from aches across my loins, and anxious
fears obtruded on my mind because of my
he >rt palpitating. This generally happened
when I had been exerting myself by walk-
ing a little distance, but at other times my
heart started beating and thumping with-
out any apparent cause. A strange feeling
came to my eyes, as if they were swollen,
and some days my sight was so bad that
everything 1 looked at appeared to be
clo ked in a mist. t You must know that 1
was quite a young man when alt this trouble
came, and it was a serious thing for me to
be wasting away like I was, and with my
nervous system so terribly affected that.l
was set all of a shake by the slightest noise,
besides continually fearing that something
of a dreadful nature was going to take place.
Fhe irregular condition of my bowels was
very injurious, but what was I to do T
Nothing gave me permanent relief from con-
stipation, and the same remark applies to
all my ailments. As I had to work for my
living my daily loss of strength was making
my future look very black, and anybody
who lias suff ied like I have can understand
what a matter for great rejoicing it was
when I found a medicine to give me re-
lief.”
“ Was it prescribed for you ? * asked the
newspaper man.
“No. I was very fortunate in savin®
doctor’s expenses, as the medicine I took
was simply thiough reading some of the ex-
traordinary cures which had been eflectec
by using Clements lonic. U hat had cui ed
others might possibly help me, I thought,
so I sent for some Clements Tonic an began
to take it. When I had drunk two bottles
my appetite had so improved that I cu d
eat nearly as well as ever, ami tire p .ins
were not half so bad as they had been. I
was quite satisfied with the advance 1 had
already made, and did not lose any time in
providing myself with more Clements
.lonic, which steadily imparted vigor to my
weakened system, and as 1 gut the fub
benefit of the food I could now relish I need
hardly tell you that I was soon strong
enough to work all day without? f eling the
least distress. To promote digestion 1 found
that Clements Tonic could uot be equalled,
as there were none of those lnconven cnees
resulting from flatulence after I had been
taking that medicine a while, and my chest
was quite free from the oppression which
had almost smothered me. Bodily pains
were gradually extinguished by Clements
lonic, and I was exceedingly glad to fiud
that my heart pal itations had ceased to
exist, while as a nerve-toning medicine I am
sure I was taking the best it was possible to
obtain, for my nervousness disappeared
completely, and my system was invigorated
throughout. It was a remarkable i estora-
tion to health which I experienced through
using Clements Tonic, which gave me per-
fect freedom from all my ailments, and as I
continued to use that medicine till my
health was sound in every way it is only
fair to give all the credit to Clements Tonic.”
“ Have you had any illness since then ? ”
“A few years ago I had four of my ribs
broken, and my system was broken down
again for a while. Indeed, I got intensely
weak and miserable, but I knew what to
fall back upon by my first experience, and
with the use of a few bottles of Clements
lonic I was made strong and vigorous as
before. Working in the mines is very ex-
hausting labor at the best of times, but in
summer it is particularly hard on the con-
stitution, and when I feel that the strain is
commencing to tell on my strength I get a
bottle or two of Clements Tonic to keep my-
self in proper working order, and the result
is that I am always healthy and happy,”
“ You have adopted a wise plan Mr
Leach.”
“I know that, and others would be
better off if they followed my example; but
when they have read these remarks, which
you can publish in any way, they can judge
for themselves.” ,
STATUTORY DECLARATION.

consecutively numbered from one to four, and that

ceiving any payment; and I make this solemn de-
claration conscientiously believing the same to be
true, and by virtue of the provisions of the Oat bs

“ Trotter’s ” account of the Maytown blacks (8., 15/2/’O2)
is a malicious and deliberate falsehood. The blacks are
not diseased, so far as outward appearances will show,
and sores and swarms of flies are not on the blacks.
HnnrfZJrmt 6 f es st ? rvin £ at Maytown, as 1501 b. of
3 | lb ; of tobacco is distributed monthly amongst
about 50 adults and 17 children, who are unable to obtain
employment and are travelling about the district. [There
is surely some mistake here in the Doctor’s letter
(type-written); 1501 b. of flour a month would give 51b.
a day among 67 people !] A number of blacks are em-
ployed by white people, but none by Chinese, whom
the police have prohibited from having blacks about
them premises No doubt the Chinese harbor and
cohabit with blacks (and white men do likewise) at
the outside camps, but they watch for a time when the
police are not in the vicinity. On account of the Chinese
a ', ''’7, tes . b ? ln " spread over a large area of the Palmer
goldfield, it.is impossible to keep a vigilant watch on
their doings at such outside camps. The natives are not
to be seen near the camps when the police are patrolling.
Chinese and blacks cannot be seen smoking opium toge-
ther in dens, nor can opium be found on the blacks or in
their camps, notwithstanding the police are continually
endeavoring to obtain opium by aboriginal agents from
those Chinese who are suspected of supplying it to the
blacks. Naked blacks can be seen in their camps and out
hunting, but not in the town, as they all have somecloth-
ing. A naked pickaninny may occasionally be seen in
town with its mother, but it invariably wears a loin-cloth.
The only cows milked at Maytown for the past three
years and five months have been two : and this was a
couple of years ago, by Mrs. Brown, wife of the clerk of
the Hann Divisional Board, who milked them herself.
Ihe blacks in the Maytown district are as healthy as
possible, excepting an old one or two, and a few occa-
sional cases of fever, which are relieved by the constable
from the supply of medicine received from the Govern-
ment.

Did you ever wonder what would be the
Effect should the master drop the
Baton? Would not the inspiration to the

Be colorless and mechanical? Watch
The effect of his controlling spirit;
See how he “leads in” the different parts
At the right moment. Should the

He makes the music ensemble.

A Literary Dinner in London.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London, and winter !
It was a violet-mist of a day. I was to be
dressed at half-past five. Mr. and Mrs. Lusao
were to call for me at that time. I flicked-on my
electric light, and drew down my blinds.
I looked out for a moment. Oh, City of London .
the Poem you are, the infinite strange Poem .
There was a time when I said to myself I wou
never love any other living bit of the world but
Sydney. I pay for that vain promise. Everyday
London creeps more and more lastingly into my
blood. Every day my pulse beats with a stronger
and stronger sense of her rhythm. E J.
take her nearer and nearer to my heart, I sway to
her beauty, I fall beneath her spell.
And now, in these lovely winter days, when the
city lies shrouded in grey mist with a violet note
in ft—o r yellow fog that turns the stern houses
into fairy palaces, and lets their light shine
through Is if suspended in the air like lanterns in
a garden —I say to myself over and over again,
“Oh, London ! how did I ever live without you .
As’l looked from my window for a moment
there flashed across me, unthinking, afrotworkof
bare black trees in the square below, beyond
the fretwork some lingering rose from a sun that
set an hour ago. And I said to myself, How
happy lam ! How lucky ! ,
For London-in-the-Mists is my London, place o
dreams. The thought of leaving her is terrible.
Ah, if you knew the poem-London ! I remem-
ber the glad surprise it was to me. I walk about
asking myself “Why did no one ever tell me?
lam not free yet from that wonder. Why did
no one ever tell me ? ” It flashes across me still,
some moment when London is lovelier than ever
purple, tender-a mist, a city, a soul all in one,
with her sky of grey chiffon, and her strange, dull,
orange suns.
* » * *
In due time I was ready ; Mr. and Mrs.
Lusac came, and off we set. Mr. Lusac is the
well-known publisher of Oriental and continental
books. My invitation came from one of his
writers, Dr. Francis Robert Harper, a /lan-
guished Orientalist, deep in Semitic work, that
brings him over here to the British Museum ,
was called away to Rome a few days bofore the
dinner, but the Lusacs were kind enough to take

Who are the White Friars? A purely literary
body, although their chief raison detre is to eat a
dinner together every Friday night. Twice a
year only, ladies are invited ; this was one of the
tW Our cab stopped somewhere in the gay, glitter-
ing cab-tangled Strand. Up red-carpeted steps
we climbed. Mrs. Lusac and I went to a cloak-room
to take off our wraps. In great curiosity I looked
round and saw all sorts and conditions of women
thoro all save one, that is. . , _
But she has ceased to exist. Did she ever exist, I
wonder? Was she not someone else than a
Literary Woman—the short-haired female with her
clothes flung at her and catching her by Divine
Providence as it were, big feet, big hands, etc. . I
believe she never was a Literary Woman at all.
She was just a woman with short hair and big
feet. The confusion arose in the brain of a
Li S these women are dressed as if they had
thought a great deal of the effect they would make.
That woman in pink, for instance a rippling,
flouncing frock of chiffon, and a wavy golden
held and a lot of shoulders-has certainly, given
much care to her frocking, Yet she writes I
couldn’t tell you how many books a year Her
name is Marie Conor Leighton. One ot her
novels is “A Napoleon of the Press,” which is
said to be a fearfully life-like picture of Alfred
Harinsworth. They say that before it came out
the Great Alfred went round to all the reviewers,
and asked them not to notice that book and when
it anneared it went without reviews. She and her
husband, the London manager for Putnam Sons
write for Answers. Said that they make a great
ail the others I see a face, one face,
thlt attracts, and haunts-a lit tie, dark pensive
face full of sweetness, full of dreams. It is
opposite me at dinner, and I often study it instead
of my Xmas turkey, or even my dinner com-
panions, though both these are first-rate.
She is an Irishwoman, was Dora Siggerson, is
now Mrs. Clement Shorter, is dressed in black,
with a lace berthe, and has curly dark hair, and
deep dark grey eyes. On her left sits her husband,
the redoubtable’clement Shorter, ed.tor of the
Sketch the Sphere and the Tatler. His thick
haf is as black as night, and frizzly-curly. They
both looked deeply ingrained foodkumor
They seemed very happy, as if they took lire
easily, though how the editor of three papers can
do that is a mystery. Mrs. Shorter is Radical to a
deeree. With all her dark soft charm she is not
afraid to sit still when the King’s health is toasted,
and everyone else rises. She sits very still, wear-
ing an expression that is half appealing, naif pen-
sive, as if to say : “ I must do this ; don t look at
““She is Irish,” says my companion-“ Pr-
o ” Then I turn to him, and forget the fasci-
nating little poetess at the other end of the table.
He is a big, broad-shouldered man with a g/yish
beard and hair, grey eyes, and the most delightful
voice and manner. He has lived years in 1 aris.
That accounts. He is Richard Whitemg, author
of “No. 5, John-street.” . „ ,
He had a friend in Australia—in Sydney. He
wondered if I knew him. They were together on
a paper in Paris, years ago. The friend went out
to P Sydney for his health. And—yes, I knew him
well And then flashed across a conversation I
had had with that very same friend, years before,
in which Richard Whiteing’s name was often men-
tloltwkspoorMr. Dekker, the editor of Sydney
Evening News. Even when we spoke of him,
there at that gay literary dinner in London, he
ha On a the d o a S'side of Mr. Whiteing sat the
sweetest old lady in the world. I use . old
more in an endearing sense, although her hair was
grey. She was Miss Alice Corkran, editor of the
Girls’Realm, and cousin, by the way, to Mr.
Victor Corkran, Lord Beauchamps secretary.
Anyone more unlike an editor blue, childish
One of the speaker
was a handsome, clean-shaved boy, with a reckless
face and a fine, well-cut head. His dark hair and
carven profile suggested an actor, bo hem
once. His name is Arthur Mason, author of
“The Courtship of Mornce Buckler, etc. Such
an impetuous, dare-devil creature 1 don t know
what lie slid. I was too much taken up with
admiring him, and the delicate yet strong voice of
him.
Mr. Whiteing talked all the time. He occa-
sionally said “Oh, God ! ” softly under his breath
when a man made bad parodies of Swinburne and
Tennyson; or, “Oh, my God! when it was a
comic song. We had great fun m our corner.
Imagine it. Mr. Lusac (Dutch) myself (Aus-
tralian), Mr. Whiteing (English and pro-Enghsh),
Miss Alice Corkran (Irish and anti-war). What a
conglomeration ! Of course, we talked about the
war. Nobody can keep off the subject here.
After dinner there was coffee and talk in other
rooms We all flocked in, and presently I found
myself talking to my adored one with the dark
head—Mrs. Shorter. We had ever so many
things in common. ...
“I thought all Australians were so terribly
Jingo,” said she. Her dark, curly fringe comes
over her eyes.
“Not all,” said I. ' , , . . , „
Next minute Marie Conor Leighton pined us.
She said The Inevitable Thing. Everybody says
it as soon as it’s known you are Australian.
Dozens, scores, hundreds of times I have had it
cast at me —in London, in the country, every-
where—from anybody and everybody: .
“You Australians were so good to us in the
W That is all England thinks of us, I verily believe!
Mrs. Shorter said—“Oh, Mrs. Creed has just
told me all Australians are disloyal.”
Sensation. Mrs. Leighton is as English as Mrs.
Shorter isn’t. She looked at me. I looked at
Mrs. Shorter. Mrs. Shorter looked at the air.
I hastened to explain : “I said all Australians
are not Jingo.” t, ,
“ Why, you were sitting next to a pro-lpei at
dinner,” said Mrs. Shorter to Mrs. Leighton,
“Tins was M. Jules Hedeman, the London cor-
respondent of Le Matin, at present in hot water
with Mr. Chamberlain. ~ ..
“Well, he is the only pro-Boer that I would sit
next to,” said Mrs. Leighton. .
He joined us at that moment, and asked me to
come with him to see Mrs. Kendall in Mrs. W.
K. Clifford’s play, “The Likeness of the Night,
next afternoon. I said “Yes.” •
We went to the play next day. It turn el out
to be an exquisite thing. I can’t understan 1 why
it didn’t have a long run. Mrs. Kendall was
wonderful, almost more life-like than life, as the
woman whose husband didn’t love her. An old
Australian favorite was in the cast, Miss Henrietta
Watson. She wore gorgeous but ugly frocks,
looked thinner, and had no chance to be anything
but pert and smart. I took an Australian with
me as chaperone, and once, when Mrs. K. was
moving everyone with that deep, still realism or
hers, I heard a voice say in a strained whisper,
“ It is a privilege to see such an actress !
I mention that because it’s rare. Every other
Australian I have met in London says How
much better everyone does every thing in
Australia.”
But to return to the dinner. .
No it’s too late; and the rest of it was all
talk.
LOUISE MACK.
The Shifting of Workman.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Workman sat like a heavy load on the chest of
Mumble Gumby. He had charge of the school
there, and ruled it with a rod of iron.
The folks of the village had tried many and
often times to get rid of its incubus.
When Dinny Ryan came home with a plentiful
stock of stripes as earnest of his encounter with
Workman, Paddy (Dinny’s father) ventured on
physical remonstrance with the teacher. Paddy
fared worse than Dinny.
When Mrs. Googan, for his “keeping Bridget
in,” tried the efficacy of combined “waddy,”
nails, and language, she was simply bundled out
of the school and incidentally fined “ 10s. and
costs ” for broken windows.
Premeditated and united rebellion by the boys
left Workman once more a victor. He put down
the insurgents with a strong hand and a long
cane.
When they tried keeping the youngsters at
home the utmost rigour of the law (2s. 6d. and
costs for not attending the statutory number of
days) rewarded them. Mumble Gumby was in
despair. If it could only find some flaw in his
character now, surely the department would shift
him ! Or, joy, would “sack” him ! .
But Workman was provokingly regular in his
habits, and strictly minded his own business
unless interfered with. ,
One morning, however, word went round that
Workman was “blind drunk” in Nolans pub.
The town went en masse to gloat over his down-
know it’s tin o’clock?” said Daddy
Ryan, triumph in his eye. _
“Don’ know ’ndon’ care, replied Workman
“Don’t yez me bhoy? Well I’m thinkin its
reportin’ yez we’ll be.”
Paddy and his colleagues then made (iff to pen
the damning epistle that was to shift their incubus.
A week later Paddy was accosted by Workman.
“ Why did you report me ? ” lie said.
“ Shure ter git rid av yez.” „
“Then you’ve gone the wrong way about it, ;
said the “incubus,” throwing a paper in Paddy s
face and storming away.
Paddy laboriously deciphered it.
Memo, to Mr. Workman. ~ _ ,
Public School, Mumble Gumby.
Si r .—Since your explanation of the circumstances re-
ported against you has been deemed unsatisfactory, 1
have to inform you that the Minister for Public Instruc-
tion has decided that you are not sufficiently trustworthy
for the increased responsibilities of the school at Warra
Warra, and has therefore cancelled your recent appoint-
ment to that school. . ,
Having under consideration your previous good
character, the Minister has instructed me to say that no
further action will be taken against you.
You will, therefore, remain in charge of your present
school.
Paddy’s “ Oi’ll be damned ! ” briefly, though
feebly, expresses Mumble Gumby public filing.
Workman, more despotic than ever, is still their
autocrat.

We Hear of Another Great Cure
in Newcastle.
Mrs. Groves, who lives at Queen’s-road,
Lambton, Newcastle, says :—“ I have much
pleasure in testifying to the virtues of Bile
Beans for Biliousness. My daughter, aged 10
years, has been a sufferer for about seven
years from liver and kidney troubles. When
four years old she was attacked with yellow
jaundice. The doctor gave her one bottle of
medicine, and said it was impossible to treat
so young a child. He advised that she should
be kept on low diet and let the malady take
its course, and it would right itself in time. I
was told to try Bile Beans for her, and since
she has been taking them her skin is much
improved and she is bright and good-tempered
like a new child. She never complains of any-
thing since taking Bile Beans for Biliousness.
She eats and sleeps well, and I am sure I owe
a great deal to your wonderful medicine.”
Bile Beans are the world’s greatest specific for
all liver ailments, comprising Biliousness, In-
digestion, Constipation, Piles, Bad Blood,
Pimples, Headache, Female Weakness, De-
bility, &c. Obtainable at all Chemists; price,
Is. lid per box, or from the Australian depot,
Bile Beans Manufacturing Co., 39 Pitt-street,
Sydney. Remember each box bears the signa-
ture of the proprietors.
I RES
Gomes Another Message,
Mr. Graham, of Highgate Hill, Brisbane,
says : —“During the past 10 years I have been
a constant sufferer from biliousness, giddiness,
and headaches, and sometimes through the
biliousness I was unable to move. During
these 10 years of misery I consulted numerous
doctors, who attributed my symptoms to my
habit of smoking strong tobacco, the discon-
tinuation of which gave me no relief. I had
also tried many patent medicines, but ob-
tained no relief whatever, so when a friend
advised me to try Bile Beans I had about
lost faith in all medicines in general; but
when my friend pressed me to give them a
trial, and accompanied his advice by a box of
the Beans, I promised I should do so. After
the first box I felt a decided improvement,
and continued a course of five boxes, by which
time I felt completely cured. My appetite,
which had been very bad before, returned to
an alarming extent. It is now five months
since my cure, and none of the old symptoms
have returned, and I feel as strong and robust
as a horse. I have recommended your Beans
to my friends, and I should like my recom-
mendation to go further, by your making use
of this statement, as I am only too proud to be
known as one of the many who praise Bile Beans
for Biliousness, the working man’s friend.”

Love Loyalty.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Is the loyalty of love but as the loyalty of race ?
Are we each to each just what we are, because of
time and place ?
Are you mine because you are mine? Could
another one be I
If, when you were ripe for loving, that one hap-
pened to be by ?
Would you still be mine in spirit though another
held this hand ?
Would your heart contain a vacant niche you
could not understand ?
Would you sometimes sit and dream of me, whom
you had never met ?
As a memory of happiness which had not hap-
pened yet ?

MAGIE SULLIVAN.
Our New Selection.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dad yarned to a man passing with horses from
New South Wales, and invited him to dinner. An
interesting man, well-informed, acquainted with
Tyson and Bobby Rand ; knew Queensland and
N.S.W. bush through-and-through, and told Dad
where some good grazing-land was to be selected.
Before leaving, the man sold five horses to Dad
for £5O. Horses were horses then, any old sketch
was worth a £5-note, and Dad went about among
the neighbors boasting of the bargain he made.
Dad always let the neighbors know when he made
a profitable investment; it helped to keep their
hearts up.
A brown mare among the five—by Butler, a
blood horse, the man said —turned out to be worth
more than £5O herself—not to Dad, though.
Dave fed her, and raced her at Pittsworth, and
was promptly “taken-up” on the course as soon
as she won.
“ Stolen from old , on the Barwon ” —the
policeman said—“been watchin’ six munch
forrer.”
The other four were stolen also.
Dad cursed. Said he would never buy another
horse as long as he lived.
Then the neighbors chuckled. They always
liked to remind Dad of any bad bargains he made.
It helped to keep his pride down.
* m * *
Newspapers gave full accounts of the arrest of
Palmer alias Whistler Smith on the Border.
“That’s th’ man,” Dad said ; “that’s th’ damn
scoundrel—red whiskers, strapped trousers, bow-
legged, finger missing—th’ daylight robber.” And
he clenched his fists on the newspaper as though
he held the delinquent in his grasp, and walked
up and down like a caged lion.
* * * *
Constable from Toowoomba waited on Dad
with a handful of legal documents and a cheque
for £l5, to solicit his attendance at Barree Circuit
Court as witness against Whistler Smith. He
explained that the law couldn’t compel Dad to
cross the Border, but if he could see his way to
make the sacrifice he (the law) was certain of a
conviction.
“ Be heaven then,” said Dad, “ I’ve a mind t’.”
He paced about, thinking the matter out. “If
y’ do,” the law observed, “call on the sergeant at
Goondi and he’ll fix you with a fresh horse and
give you directions. An’ I’d advise y’, meself, to
put a revolver in your pocket—it won’t be any
load, an’ y’ might want it. ”
“Pshaw!” Dad blurted out. “Pshaw man !

travelled the country long before you were born ?
an’ see (Dad paused before the constable, and
raising his hands, punched his own left palm hard
with his right fist), see here, an’ though I’m saying
it meself, never yet did I see th’ man (Dad tapped
his palm gently), never yet did I see th’ living
man (Dad raised his right hand above his head) I
was afeared (elevating his voice) to take me shirt
off t’ ” (he pounded his palm hard).
The constable smiled, and said he quite believed
it.
“Well, y’ better let it slide, an’ stay at home,”
Dave said, advisedly—“y’r too old fer that sort o’
thing now.”
Mother and Sarah, who were listening, agreed
with Dave.
“Tut, tut,” Dad said ; “not a bit of it— not a
bit of it.”
Then his thoughts reverted to the £5O he lost,
and an angry, vindictive spirit rose within him.
“ I’ll go ; policeman ! ” he said, in a loud, deci-
sive voice—“ Til go ! ” And when Dad spoke in
that tone persuasion was futile.
* • » *
Mounted on his old brown mare, Dad started
one Friday for Barree, and how anxious mother
became the moment he disappeared from view !
Barree was three hundred miles off on the
New South Wales side and .most of the track and
the country were new and unknown to Dad. But
we were sanguine enough about him. Dad had
always been a wonder and an object lesson to us
in the way of courage and endurance. Floods,
fires, droughts—nothing ever stopped him, and
for anything the bush contained in the shape of
beast or being, he never held a dread.
* * * »
A drought was upon the land. Grass round
Saddletop withered, stock poor, water scarce; but
as Dad travelled on—covering mile upon mile,
plain after plain, ridge after ridge—things got
worse and worse. All was parched, perished ;
nothing but dust and desolation. The mighty
bush was a vast sorrowful was'e —cracked, burnt,
baked. A horror ! it was hell!
Shapeless, blear-eyed, looney bullocks—gro-
tesque caricatures—staggered pathetically by the
way. All day a foul, foetid air filled his nostrils;
hateful crows flocked from carcase to carcase
clamouring in fiendish exultation. And skeletons
—skeletons and bones lay everywhere !
At intervals Dad met pairs of grim, sullen souls
along this endless avenue of odium—mates on the
terrible track—strong, able-bodied men—men with
bright, clear intellects, not loafers, not liars—
British men, Australian men—shouldering their
swags, almost bootless in the blistering sand-
through the sickening, thirst-provoking heat in
search of a job.
* * * *
Dad left Goondi with a fresh horse, a water-
bag, tucker, a head full of directions, and a re-
volver.
The latter the sergeant pressed on him, and
Dad finally took it, saying, “ Perhaps it ’ll be
company,” and he carried it, projecting from his
coat pocket like a cob of corn.
The fourth day, Dad penetrated a dense scrub,
and emerged on the bank of a creek, watered
ms norse, and, throwing the reins on the ground
as with his own old mare, left him standing on the
bank while he filled the water-bag. The brute
made off. Dad tried to catch him, but the old dog
was knowing as a detective. He trotted when
Dad ran and walked when Dad pulled up.
• 1 j n a mess. Determined not to lose
sight of the horse, he followed at its heels, sweat-
mg, swearing, tripping over ruts and sticks—fol-
lowed till it got dark and he could see the fugitive
no longer. °
Weary and hungry Dad rested at the foot of a
gum-tree and thought of home and mother and
us, and called himself a darned fool, and wondered
it, after all, convicting horse-thieves was worth
the candle.
In the morning Dad’s horse was only a few
hundred yards away, standing, its hind leg fast in
the bridle. Joy ! Dad’s heart thumped till he
placed his hands on the brute and was in the
saddle again. He was never so proud of a horse
before; he leaned over and patted it on the neck.
time_ Dad would have tugged its mouth
and belted its ribs with a waddy.
* * * .
A stifling day. The sky a great flaming oven.
i wind blowing. Sandv, wretched waste
land to the right; same to the left. Never a soul
had Dad seen for 40 miles but one solitary horse-
man, and he, at sight of Dad’s revolver, galloped
away.
■"u 6 sun down a ball of fire. A swamp
with water and ducks in it showed itself, then off
the road a public-house, a dusty, tumble-down old
rookery. A couple of saddle-horses outside,
fastened to trees. Four persons lounged on the
verandah. Two more men with beards, strapped
trousers, and spurs. Other two scarcely more than
youths—one a half-caste.
“ G’day,” Dad said.
“’Day.”
And when Dad dismounted every eye there was
on his horse.
Behind the bar,_ hurriedly scrubbing a glass
with a dirty towel in anticipation of trade, stood
a lame, one-eyed old warrior with scars on his head.
Dad called for a beer, then glanced back at the
horse. Dad remembered the sergeant’s warning.
Dad took the beer and drank it at the door.
“Come far?” the publican said, eyeing Dad
closely.
“Two hundred and fifty mile, I dare say,” Dad
answered.
“Queensland ?”
Dad was wondering whether he would answer
or not when a horseman of the flash bush type
reined up at the door. He spoke to those outside,
then called out— “ Riley.”
Riley crept under the counter and limped to the
door.
“Th’ traps passed Bingiloo yesterday with the
Queenslander,” the horseman shouted.
Riley didn’t understand.
“With who ? ” he asked.
“The witness to fix ‘Whistler’; they’refetchin’
him in irons.”
The half-caste sniggered ironically.
Riley looked grave.
Dad stepped out, and, clearing his throat, fixed
the man on horseback with both eyes.
“ It’s a damn lie!” he roared.
Every eye was upon Dad in an instant. For a
moment a dead silence.
Dad squared himself and stood up to it—hasty,
haughty-looking.
“It’s a damn lie ! ” he roared again ; “ f’r I’m
th’ man ; an’ where ’re me irons ? ” He stepped
aside, displaying his big feet for inspection.
, The horseman scowled, but something he read
m a glance from Riley changed his expression.
He dismounted and approached Dad smiling.
“You’re Mr. Rudd, then,” he said, “from the
head of the Condamine ? ”
“I am,” Dad answered, never changing a
muscle. The man said he had been to Dad’s
several times. He spoke well of it, and told Dad
he was a nephew of old Gray’s.
Dad forgot the sergeant’s warning. He seized
Gray’s “ nephew ” by the hand and shook it.
“ Wull, wull,” he said, “ an’ I tooky’ fer a 'orse
stealer ,” and Dad chuckled by way of apology.
Gray’s “nephew” chuckled also.
The publican proposed a drink. Dad drank
and returned the shout. That was seven o’clock.
• * • •
Midnight. The moon shone fitfully and lit up
the belt of cabbage gums; from the swamp came
the trumpet note of wild geese ; owls on noiseless
wing were hunting round; a dim, sickly light
flickered at the pub. Two horsemen rode away
from it through the trees leading a horse with a
saddle on.
From a back room a voice kept calling:
“ Dorgsh ! —robersh !—P-übli’an \—P-übli’an !
wher’sh me—hie—sholver ? ”
’Twas Dad’s.

STEELE RUDD.
“ F.R.” on a scientific matter :
I was considerably interested in the announcement
that Professor Loeb had discovered that electricity was
the base of our nerve force, and that he anticipated
being- able to prolong life indefinitely. I understand that
this prof, with the strange name hails from Chicago, and
I think I remember reading about him some few years ago
in a weekly called the Progressive Thinker, published in
the pork city. On that occasion the Thinker, which is
devoted to “ the exposition of advanced thought,” pub-
lished a two-col. account, with scare-heads, of the dis-
covery of the “ microbe of death.” The professor had
found the alleged microbe in the stem of a Japanese
lily, which flowers and dies in a day. Upon removing
the devastating microbe, the lily-bloom retained its fresh-
ness for three weeks, and was as good as ever when the
paper went to press. The professor went further, and
extracted the microbe from several frogs, grasshoppers,
&c., which thereupon immediately lived for ever. The
next time I struck the Thinker— two years later—it had
a lengthy detailed account of a discovery made by a
Chicago professor and an Italian scientist, to the
effect that stones were really living* organisms;
that granite and marble were as much alive as a human
being; and that under “certain conditions,” and with
the aid of “ a powerful lens ” the stones could be plainly
seen moving about. It added that the professors men-
tioned were about to publish a big volume with “ 200
wonderful illustrations” proving their contentions. I
made up my mind to get that book, but I don’t see it
announced yet. The last Thinker which fell into my
hands—dated Dec. last year—had the weirdest yarn of
the lot. It was a 3-col. account, with the usual black
double-column cross-heads, of a man “ whose nerve
centres were crossed,” and who saw with his fingers,
smelled with his ears, felt with his eyes, and tasted with
his nose. It gave names, dates, places, and full par-
ticulars. If the man wore gloves he became blind, and
if his hands got dirty his “sight” was dim. By
holding one hand at his back he could see both ways ; and
poking his finger round a corner he could see down a
street without exposing the rest of himself. The legend
wound up with a circumstantial account of the approach-
ing visit of a “ famous German specialist ” who intended
to try and straighten this entangled person. It must be
understood that these munchausens were not printed as
jokes. The Progressive Drinker is about the most
seriously-written journal that I have ever struck ; and
the man who sent me my copies is an exceptionally
solemn individual. He believed the lot, and cited these
awful tales as a sample of American up-to-date-ness.
