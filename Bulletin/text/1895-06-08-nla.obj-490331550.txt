COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cur*.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on tne chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to
obtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
Srove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
i,ev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known : in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that rny father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Ever ton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure ? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure. —J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir, —I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.- —Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-

O UXISSIjVEIS
We wish It to be understood that the character of tin .
business we do, and the absolutely inclusive variety of tin
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings-
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life —honest
citizens in every comriiunity, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
froth the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of tin
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stand-
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN'S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
neveroease from their toil ; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it. has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

LEONAINIE.
Leonainie —Angels named her;
And they took the light
Of the laughing stars and framed her
In a smile of white;
And they made her hair of gloomy
Midnight, and her eyes of bloomy
Moonshine, and they brought her to me
In the solemn night—
In the solemn night of summer,
When my heart of gloom
Blossomed up to greet the comer
Like a rose in bloom;
All forebodings that distressed me
I forgot as Joy caressed me —
(Lying Joy ! that caught and pressed me
In the arms of doom !).
Only spake the little lisper
In the angel-tongue;
Yet 1, listening, heard her whisper—
“ Songs are only sung
Here below that they may grieve you—
Tales but told you to deceive you—
So must Leonainie leave you
While her love is young.”
Then God smiled and it was morning,
Matchless and supreme;
Heaven’s glory seemed adorning
Earth with its esteem.
Every voice but mine seemed gifted
With the voice of prayer, and lifted
Where my Leonainie drifted —
From me like a dream.
1853.

*[The foregoing verses, in imitation of Edgar Allan Poe,
were very incorrectly printed in a recent Bulletin —this
paper (which did not know who wrote che lines) having
republished them just as they appeared in the journal
from which they were clipped years ago. The author,
Tub Bulletin now finds, is James Whitcomb Riley, wide y
known as a clever American writer of verse—chiefly in Ihe
Hoosier or Indiana dialect. “When the Frost is on the
Pumpkin” is in his more characteristic vein.]
WHEN THE FROST IS ON THE PUMPKIN.
When the frost is on the pumpkin and the fodder’s
in the shock,
And you hear the kyouck and gobble of the strut-
tin’ turkey-cock,
And the clackin’ of the guineys, and the cluckin’
of the hens,
And the rooster’s hallylooyer as he tiptoes on the
fence;
O, it’s then’s the times a feller is a-feeling at his
best,
With the risin’ sun to greet him from a night of
peaceful rest,
As he leaves the house, bare-headed, and goes o .t
to feed the stock,
When the frost is on the pumpkin and the fodder’s
in the shock.
They’s something kind o’ harty-like about the
atmosphere
When the heat of summer’s over and the coolin’
fall is here.
Of course we miss the flowers, and the blossoms
on the trees,
And the mumble of the huramin’-birds and buzzin’
of the bees;
But the air’s so appetizin’; and the landscape
through the haze
Of a crisp and sunny morning of the airly autumn
days
Is a picture that no painter has the colorin’ to
mock —
When the frost is on the pumpkin and the fodder’s
in the shock.
The husky, rusty rustle of the tossels of the corn,
And the raspin’ of the tangled leaves, as golden as
the morn;
The stubble in the furries—kind o’ lonesome-like,
but still
A-preachin’ sermons to us of the barns they growed
to fill;
The strawstack in the medder, and the reaper in
the shed;
The bosses in theyr stalls below—the clover over-
head ! . ....
O, it sets my heart a-olickin’ like the tiokm of a
clock,
When the frost is on the pumpkin and the fodder s
in the shock !

John Hausmann, the Melbourne and Syd-

ters for the past two years. He has been a
bookmaker for a quarter of a century, has been a
member of Tattersall’s over twenty years, and has
probably not made an enemy the whole time. He
is a safe man, who attends strictly to business.

James Robson, “ an old 58fch Regb. man,”
and for 30 years storekeeper at Darlinghurst gaol,
died the other day, aged 73 years. Apropos : Now
holding a responsible position in Darlinghurst
gaol is a man who, nearly 26 years ago, was
assaulted by a prisoner in Parramatta gaol, for
which assault the man was hanged. He protested
against being executed, as the injured man did not
die. His protest, of course, availed nothing, but
he created a terrible scene upon the scaffold, and
immediately before being “ turned off ” made a
furious onslaught upon Bull, the then hangman,
who was so injured that he had to resign the
man-butchership, and retire to Liverpool Asylum,
where he soon died'

and children an order for the Benevolent Asylum.”

A Buried Infamy.
J ust now, while the eyes of Australasia are
on the Dean alleged-poisoning case, is so
obviously the inopportune time to dig up the
old but enduringly-smellful infamy of the
Mount Rennie trial that no apology is neces-
sary for recurring to that half-buried story.
The right time, according to all orthodox
ideas, to refer to it would be when the pre-
sent agitation was over, and the community,
temporarily tired of such subjects, had
settled down to that state of stolid indiffer-
ence which commonly passes for a judicial
frame of mind. The wrong time, as already
mentioned, is just now, and The Bulletin
deliberately selects the wrong time on the
ground that it is the only right time in such
cases. Nearly every good thing which has
been done iu this world has been effected
only by doing it at what “all right-thinking
persons ” would describe as the wrong time,
and, therefore, this paper always endeavors
to select that time, and its only regret is
that it sometimes makes mistakes and selects
an occasion which, unfortunately, is not so
wrong as it looks.
# * *
The Mount Rennie case differed from the
Dean case principally because there was
practically no after-inquiry whatsoever. The
condemued-to-death Dean got his inquiry
because great public pressure was brought
to bear on the facile Premier Reid,
who saw quite clearly that resistance
would mean the death of his Ministry.
The main causes of this public pres-
sure were that Dean was young and
rather handsome ; that owing to his position
as master of a ferry-boat he was well-known
to many influential citizens, including news-
paper-men ; that there was a sort of pic-
turesque halo round him because he had
earned a reputation for bravery by saving
several human lives at the risk of his own ;
that his accusers were his somewhat fas-
cinating wife and his sinister old hag of a
mother-in-law ; that he was a Freemason and
had the whole Masonic influence behind him
—and that, in a minor degree only (alas,
that it should be so!), his trial was a
parody on the forms of justice. The Mount
Rennie trial was a hideous parody on the
forms of Justice, and it was rushed through
under the presidency of the same Judge, who
“summed up strongly against the prisoners”
—just as he did against Dean, and who took
a hurried verdict from a jury exhausted to
stupidity by day-and-night sittings. But
the Mount Rennie prisoners were not hand-
some, even according to the widest inter-
pretation of the term. They were not
acquainted with any solid financial citizens
or respectable men. They hadn’t been
known to save anybody’s life under pic-
turesque circumstances, and they had no
Masonic influence. Also, they had not
among them one good-looking wife whose
portrait would look well iu the papers, or
even one mysterious mother-in-law with a
history. And the public agitation in their
case, instead of having only to deal with the
kindly and complacent though rather con-
fused Reid, ran up against the metallic
backbone of the dunderheaded Minister
Dibbs, and the callousness of the London
man-about-town in whom, at that time, hap-
pened to be vested the Law’s final preroga-
tive. So Dean was granted a second trial,
and the Mount Rennie convicts, with an
even better case, were hanged or sent to
rot in gaol for life.
* * »
The Mount Rennie prisoners were found
guilty mainly on the evidence of the
girl Hicks and two other witnesses. The
testimony of the former was to the effect
that she was a good, pure girl, who had been
brutally robbed of a woman’s best possession
—her honor. The Court accepted her at her
own valuation. The face of the law was
set against any serious enquiry into the
character of the Crown witnesses—just as it
was set against seriously enquiring into the
character of the Brisbane street-walker who,
figuring in Sydney as an outraged innocent,
got the man Buttner condemned to death,
and all but succeeded in having him hanged
—the jury having been utterly misled by the
woman’s statements and the medical evi-
dence. In fact (as witness the severe judi-
cial rebuke experienced by barrister Cana-
way at the trial), the Mount Rennie girl’s
purity and good character were aggressively
taken for granted by the Court. In much
the same way the irreproachableness of the
unspeakable Mrs. Seymour’s career in her
later years was taken for granted in the
Dean case—wherein counsel for the defence
was sternly reproached for attempting to
disparage the record of the old harridan who
began life as a pickpocket and prostitute,
and was at recent dates figuring, on her
own admission, as pimp to a procuress. The
jury found the Mount Rennie prisoners
guilty because they were led to believe
that the prosecutrix the female who
drove out to a lonely place with a
strange cabman, and thereafter got into
trouble, apparently with (at first) her own
consent—was a pure and virtuous girl, and
because they hadn’t sufficient cool intelli-
gence to see the glaring improbability of
the assertion. The after-inquiry into the
Dean case has shown how a man’s way to
the gallows may be greased by stupidiy-rash
judicial assumptions. A few more such
inquii-ies in past times might possibly have
shown how other men had actually arrived
at the noose from the same cause.
• * *
The two witnesses who made up nearly all
that remained of the case against the Mount
Rennie prisoners were named respectively
Stanley and Smith. Their honor, truthful-
ness, and reliability was also taken pretty
much for granted in the unseemly heat and
haste of the shameful and gory burlesque
which passed as a “trial.” The reliable
Smith, who had been “ruled out ”iu Maori-
land over some turf-trouble, was, shortly
after the Mount Rennie trial, sentenced at a
N.S.W. up-country criminal sittings to a
long term in gaol for arson. The reliable
and valorous Stanley, the Crown’s chief
witness, even while ex-Ohief Justice Stephen
and other credulous admirers were getting
up a testimonial to reward his heroism
in the defence of female virtue, was
stated to have traded off a forged
cheque on a city publican in exchange
for cash and drink. The cheque, by the
way, purported to be signed by a firm who
acted as treasurers of the Stanley testi-
monial fund, of which Mr. Stanley appears
to have been in much need. A criminal in-
formation was sworn and a warrant issued
against the heroic alleged cheque-negotiator,
but apparently so averse were the au-
thorities to discrediting that valorous
person that he was not arrested until a news-
paper reporter took the trouble to point him
out in the street to a policeman as the subject
of a warrant. Then, by some process
which was never explained, the bogus cheque
was paid, and the affair “squared,”
and quietly dropped into oblivion. Stan-
ley, on whose evidence chiefly several
boys had been sentenced to death and
four (of the average age of 18 years only)
actually strangled by the hangman, was
allowed to depart for regions unknown—the
money collected to reward heroism having
possibly been used to compound a fj’ony.
The smothering of this unsavory business
was evidently done by persons of influence-
no others could have stopped the machine of
justice when once it was set in motion. The
action of these persons—whoever they might
be—not only prevented Stanley from being
tried for his alleged crime, but also prevented
a review of bis character and career,
which might have shed a bright and com-
paratively early light on the whole Mount
Rennie tragedy. And as no influential man
or men with position to lose would be likely
to break the law and risk his or their own
safety merely for the sake of a shady person
who had uttered a forged cheque, if indeed
he had not personally committed forgery, it
is only feasible to assume that the squaring
was done to smother impending revelations
and to avert the ridicule to which the hero-
worshippers might have been exposed. So
far, there ha® been no public inquiry as to who
compounded Stanley’s alleged crime, why it
was compounded, and why no action has
been taken against the person or persons,
whoever he or they may be, who thus de-
feated the ends of j ustice.
* * *
The Mount Rennie prisoners were, with-
out exception, defended by junior barristers,
some of whom actually got not one penny for
their arduous task. The accused were, in
one sense, practically undefended—they had
no adequate means of hunting up the
antecedents of the witnesses against them,
and the police and the Crown Law Depart-
ment—whose business is, and has ever been,
to show one side of the case only, and get a
conviction—made no effort to do so. How
this kind of tacit suppression can be effected
is sufficiently indicated by the recent
case of Mrs. Seymour— nearly all the
evidence against whom has come (after the
prisoner’s conviction and death-sentence)
from sources outside the Sydney detectives,
though several members of that force
were unquestionably well aware of the
woman’s character. “To find a parallel to
the Mount Rennie trial,” said the late W.
B. Dalley, Q.C. “one has to search the
darkest and bloodiest days of Irish history.”
It was the most infamous affair of its kind in
all the post-convict days of Australia. The
first day (Monday), the court sat for 11
hours ; the second day, for 141 r hours ; the
third and fourth days (Wednesday and
Thursday), it only sat for hours each day,
and it is notable that, on the evening
of each of these two days, the presiding
Judge attended a fashionable public dinner !
On the fifth day (Friday) proceedings began
at 9 a.m. and went on until 3.30 a.m. on
Saturday (18| hours). Then (the jury and
barristers and Judge having had 5| hours
wherein to eat and sleep and wash)
the Court re-assembled at 9 the same
morning and went on until past 11
at night (over 14 hours), when nine
of the accused were found guilty and
sentenced to death ! The counsel for the
prosecution got its statements in at the early
part of the week when the 12 men in the
box were still fully awake and able to under-
stand what was said to them. When the
defence came on, the Court sat for over
38| hours with only 5| hours’ intermission !
The prisoners slumbered fitfully in the dock.
Read (afterwards hanged) slept in the dock
while his counsel (who had then been 15
consecutive hours in court) went through the
mockery of beginning to address the jury on
his behalf at midnight ; the lawyers dozed
intermittently at their table ; the jurymen
slept at intervals in the box, and “ between
whiles ” passed a salts-bottle up and down
their ranks for the purpose of stimulation ;
one juryman was so ill from sheer exhaus-
tion that his life was said to be in danger,
and counsel might almost as well have
wasted words on a corpse. When an ad-
journment was applied for at midnight on
Friday (by a poorly-paid counsel in the first
stage of phthisis, who declared that he was
utterly exhausted), it was pointed out to him
(thus does history anticipate itself) that
unless the trial proceeded the jury “ would
be kept over Sunday ” —“ thereby throw-
ing on me,” as the counsel afterwards
said, “ the responsibility of choosing be-
tween offending the jury and absolutely wast-
ing my speech on the wretched boy I was
defending.” And so, scrambling on night
and day in the foetid court and the swelter-
ing atmosphere of midsummer, the dozing
lawyers feebly addressing the sleeping jury,
and che prisoners occasionally waking up in
the dock to hear them, the case jolted along
to the midnight verdict and the inevitable
gallows.
• • *
There was practically no evidence, ex-
cept that of the girl, and some police-
reported alleged admissions by certain of
the accused, that any offence had been
committed— i.e., that the girl was not a
consenting party. If a crime was com-
mitted, there was practically no evidence,
save that of the same girl and Stanley
and Smith, that the prisoners were the
persons who committed it. The girl’s iden-
tification of the prisoners was shown to be in
part faulty, for at least one of those whom
she identified was able to prove a conclusive
alibi —iu itself an interesting commentary on
the value of the whole identification. The
fact that Judge Windeyer summed up
strongly against the accused, and leantstrongly
towards belief in the respectability and truth-
fulnessof theprosecutrix, is equally discounted
by the fact that the same visionary has since
practically apologised for Mrs. Seymour,
and seriously lent the light of his counten-
ance to a solemn enquiry as to the authenti-
city of Mrs. Mellon’s ghosts. And the fact
that something transpired which afterwards
made some police official or other person find
it necessary to commit a gross breach of
the law rather than let the career of the
chief Mount Rennie witness be examined in
rhe light of day makes it eminently desirable
that this old iniquity should even now be
fully dealt with by Parliament.
Four of the Mount Rennie prisoners are
dead—they went to make a picturesque
hanging one summer morning eight years
ago ; but the other five still exist, some in
gaols and some in lunatic asylums ; and for
their sake and for the sake of justice their
case and the manner of their trial should
now be reviewed. As a postscript The Bul-
letin here quotes the ineffectual protest
addressed by Mr. T. 0. O’Mara (since dead),
one of the accused’s counsel, to the cold-
blooded Carrington, who, to the disgrace
of justice and civilisation, was then Gover-
nor of New South Wales :
May it please your Excellency:—
At the late trial of the youths accused and convicted of
participation in the Mount Rennie outrage, I appeartd as
counsel on behalf of Robert George Read. At a critical
stage of the inquiry it became my duty to protest in open
court against the manner in which the trial proceeded, so
far as it affected my client. That protest I believe to
be so well founded, that I cannot rest content without
prosecuting it to the very last stage. Hence it is that I
address your Excellency. It is rarely that counsel
obtrudes upon the attention of the Executive that which
he has already bad the opportunity of urging elsewhere,
but there are times when to be silent is a crime, and this
I believe to be eminently one of those occasions. To give
a prisoner—particularly one who is being tried for his life
—a fair hearing, it is not enough that the dry forms of
oiir procedure, humane as it is, be observed. The
accused is entitled to much more. He always receives
much more. He is entitled to demand that un-
due strain shall not be put upon the advocate in
whose hands lie, so to speak, places his life. He has a
right to demand that when his defence is submitted it
shall not be heard by a worn-out and jaded jury. He has
a riaht to protest that at an hour almost approaching to
midnight on the fifth day of a laborious and, to him,
awful investigation, he should not be called to enter on
his last attempt to show a jury that he should not suffer
death, and for a most atrocious crime. And when re-
minded of the value to the jurymen of their own time he
has a riaht to reply, as Read did, through his counsel,
but without avail, that in the determination of an issue
so terrible to him the time of the jury is not for one
moment to be considered, except in'so far as it belongs,
for the moment, wholly to him on the one side, and to the
public, his accusers, on the other. When the question is
whether he is to die the death of a cowardly ruffian, and
when he asks, as he did, for fair opportunity to show that
he should not be doomed to such a death, is it right, my
lord, that he should be told that the jury must not, if
possible, he “ kept over Sunday?” And is he to he further
told that he has had a satisfactory trial, when the most
solemn part of a criminal proceeding, the Judge's
summing up, is delivered to men almost drugged
in some instances into a state of stupor by
the unreasonable exactions put upon the attention
which they were so anxious to bestow upon the
case. Has he not a right to demand that from beginning
to end of this inquiry, so terrible in its consequences to
him, his case should he heard and decided by men whose
faculties have never slumbered for one moment? When
before, rny Lord, in a British community, has it been
seen or heard of, that jurymen have slept, or, rather,
under pressure of Nature, have been compelled to sleep
in open court during an inquiry so awful in its character
as to involve the lives of eleven men ? And yet it is a
fact in this case jurymen did sleep—dead, at times, in
spite of themselves, to the voice upon whose every accent
they were supposed to hang for guidance—that of the
presiding Judge. It is demanded that Read be hanged
because the crime in which he was alleged to have taken
part was unexampled in its atrocity. If that be so, then
let the care with which his guilt is proved, hut, above all,
the patience witli which his defence is heard, be in pro-
portion to the horrible nature of the charge levelled
against him. Do not tell him that those who try him must
not be “ kept over the Sunday.” Do not tell him
that he is to make his last appeal for his life under
circumstances which compel him to make, and most
jusily, open and public protest. Do not tell him that he
was jusily denied the request he made, when he had been
for five days in the dock, for a few hours’ delay that the
jury might again meet, refreshed and more capable of
giving that to which lie was entitled as a most sacred
right—the closest and most intelligtnt attention to every-
one of the few feeble words that were about to be uttend,
for the last time, on his behalf. Do not tell him that
he was unreasonable when, on the fifth day of a prolonged
and exhausting trial —a trial without precedent almost
in the number of men accused, without precedent in its
awful claims upon the attention of all concerned in it,
because it was without precedent in the nature of the
crime charged—he asked at 12 o’clock at night that those
in whose hands he had placed himself, his counsel and
the jury, might have a few hours rest. He asked
this favor, my lord, and asked it, I regret to say, in vain.
If there is anything, as your Excellency well knows, by
which British criminal procedure is nobly distinguished
from that of other countries, it is by its humane and
jealous protection of the rights of an accused person from
the moment of charge to that of conviction. And this
protection is mercifully extended to him, and not, my
lord, as some people appear to think, withdrawn from
him, in proportion to the enormity of the offence of
which he is accused.
Some years ago, when the community, terror-stricken
by the prevalence in our midst of a crime now happily
extinguished, demanded the blood of an unhappy young
man, Sir James Martin addressed to one of your prede-
cessors, on behalf of the cause of calm and temperate jus-
tice, a stirring remonstrance which time has, I believe,
more than vindicated. I wish I could, in the same noble
language, deprecate the unreasoning anger which in some
quarters clamors for the blood of Read, and which,
because an awful outrage has been committed, will only
be appeased by a victim. It is terrible that the
daughters of our people should suffer outrage, hut it is
only less to be deplored that the passion thereby justly
excited should forget (as it appears to me to have done in
this case) the serenity with which English law loves to
deal out its justice—particularly to those unhappy beings
who are called upon to answer for their lives.
I have nothing further to address to your Excellency on
the merits of the case. As it concerns Read, it would he
an impertinence for me to speak if your Excellency is of
opinion that the manner in which he has been tried repre-
sents the true spirit of that which we are all bound to
vindicate, and on behalf of which I have presumed to
address your Lordship —British justice.
I have the honor to be, my Lord,
Your most obedient servant,
T. C. O’MAHA.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Voice from the Piebald Laud.
The voice of the Brisbane Courier comes from
the piebald province of the North :
The Protectionist does not usually venture to demand
that duties shall be continued to the end of time. His
plea is that the duty is necessary to establish an industry,
and his promise is that in a few years, when Prot eotion
has thus done its work, the duty will be abolished. The
exceptional thing about the sugar-industry is that the
duty has not done its work. It has not established the
industry. Now, at the end of 40 years, the industry is as
far from being established as ever, and protests that the
abolition of the duty will be its ruin just as it might have
protested 30 years ago. More than that, according to (he
statement of Mr. KNOXhimself, tbereis not the slightest pro-
spect of its being established. . . Of the 35,640 tons cf
sugar already noticed as imported into New South Wales.
29,840 tons came from Queensland, notwithstanding the
£5 duty. That import represents the power of the
natural home of the sugarcane to push its product against
the fiscal barrier. But suppose the barrier removed 7
Then Queensland would step in to supply the greater part
of the 24,000 tons of sugar now grown in New South
Wales, and the colonies as a whole would be saved the
sums now wasted in the unnatural bolstering of the in-
dustry in the South.
(1) The Protectionist doesn’t promise that Pro-
tection will be abolished in a few years, any
more than Freetraders promise that" Freetrade
will he abolished in a few years. Protection
must go on till wages and hours of labor arc
equalised, either through foreign competitors
rising to the Australian standard, or through
the Australian sinking to their standard. If


neither of these events happen, then it must
go on for ever. (2) The New South Wales
sugar-industry hasn’t been protected for 40
years, for the sufficient reason that it only
began 31 years ago. (3) So far as can be
Fathered from available statistics, the New
outh Wales sugar-industry can stand against
Queensland without Protection, if both provinces
employ white labor. It all turns on that one
question. In both provinces the industry had
to compete against Java, Mauritius, and other
nigger-labor countries. New South Wales did it
by Protection alone ; Queensland did it by nigger-
labor and Protection. The Queensland sugar-
duty is exactly the same as that of New South
Wales; the Queensland sugar-industry, sup-
ported by a heavy tariff and cheap alien labor,
is working under conditions just as unnatural
as those in New South Wales, and it is nothing
short of lying and unutterable gall to quote the
doubly-protected cane-industry of Queensland
as an example of Freetrade and a beacon to her
benighted neighbor. An artificial reduction of
wages, arrived at for the benefit of a special
industry by a Polynesian labor-law, is just as
much Protection as an artificial increase of
prices arrived at by a Tariff Act. Queensland
should prove that her own industry is in any
sense a “natural” one before the Courier
again raises its voice in the Piebald Land, and
tne New South Wales alleged economists who
point to Queensland in this matter should first
acquire some rudimentary idea of the real state
of things in that province.
One Adult One Vote.
The Vic. Parliament met last week, and the
Turner Govt, presented a programme which
fairly entitles it to be regarded as the most pro-
gressive Ministry in Australia, Kingston’s
alone excepted. The Turner combination
proved, by the first few divisions, to have a
very strong majority, and Patterson’s Oppo-
sition crowd was evidently cast down as well
as feeble, and looked like a party with some-
thing lying heavily on its stomach. Therefore,
so far as can be seen at present, Turner’s bills
—even the bill for establishing the principle
of One Adult One Vote : —will go through
the Assembly with comparative ease, and then
the most Democratic of them will be decisively
thrown out by the Council, as heretofore.
The Companies Bill, the Insolvency Bill, and
the various retrenchment measures will prob-
ably survive and become law, but the One
Adult One Vote idea is abhorrent to the House
;>f Rich Landlords, and it is practically born
dead. Nevertheless, there is nothing else for a
democratic Assembly to do but to keep on
passing such bills from year to year, and compel
the Council, if it objects to them, to throw
them back regularly in the face of the public,
and take the responsibility. The Vic. Council
can’t be swamped, because it is an elective
body ; and there is hardly any hope of making
it democratic, for it is a House mostly
elected by landlords, and in which only rich
landlords can sit according to the terms of
the property qualification, which qualification
can’t be altered except with the Council’s own
consent. Therefore, the Assembly, for the
present at least, has only two alternatives.
It can cease to spend its time in passing demo-
cratic measures which it knows in advance will
be lost in the House of the fatted land-grab-
bers, in which case the public will presently
cease to notice that it is the said House of land-
grabbers that blocks democratic progress.
Or it can simply follow the expressed will of
its own constituents, and pass the same demo-
cratic measures year after year, and leave the
Council to throw them out each session and
earn new odium with each rejection, and thus
make the 48 rich landlords keep rubbing in the
fact that they are the one hopeless, stupid,
soulless snag in the misguided Constitution.
The latter is undoubtedly the wiser course. The
Vic. Council wants to reject everythingin theway
of democratic reform. It also wants to pose as an
enlightened and valuable public institution, and
it certainly should not be allowed to do both
things at once. It is almost impossible to
believe that Turner’s Adult Suffrage Bill will
pass the Council, but the time spent upon it
will be well employed none the less. And even
if it is introduced and rejected every session for
the rest of this century, the time devoted to it
will still be well employed. Every time the
Council rejects it, that body advertises itself in
huge letters as being the great, incurable ass of
Victorian politics. The public hasn’t fully
realised this yet, and the fact wants to be
mentioned in a loud voice over and over again
until everybody has heard it and learned it by
heart. Therefore, every time the Council is
made to hang out its vast, hairy ears as a sign-
board, a service is rendered to the country, and
the time when the country will fully realise the
contour of the animal and insist on its removal,
by legal means or otherwise, is brought a little
pearer.
A Model Municipality.
In the Fortnightly Review for April appears
an article entitled “Glasgow: a model muni-
cipality,” which should be read by all those
Australians who barrack for “ private enter-
prise,” and assert, on no visible evidence, that
state and municipal Socialism are costly, ineffi-
cient, impracticable, and an all-round failure.
In Glasgow, the Corporation created and owns
the water-supply, which was brought at
vast expense from a lake 35 miles distant, and
the city has now the purest, most abundant,
and cheapest water in Great Britain. It is
also commencing to supply hydraulic power at
a pressure of lOOOlbs. to the square inch, which
will largely supersede the use of steam through-
out the city. It owns the gas - works, and
since it took them over in 1869, it has
trebled the supply and reduced the price about
60 per cent. It supplies electric-light at about
the lowest rate in Great Britain. In addition
to this it runs the tramways—which it took
over about six years ago. During the period of
its ownership the service has been greatly im-
proved, the hours of labor for the emp'iyes
considerably reduced, the fares have been ;ut
down from 20 to 33 per cent.—a halfpenny is
now the minimum, whilst the highest fare
charged is 2d., and the trams pay all
work in w exp-ms 'nterest on capital and pay-
ment to sinking-fund, and contribute .£9OOO a
year to the general revenue. Also, it is now
proposed to make a penny the maximum fare
throughout the city. The Corporation runs the
“ City Improvement Trust,” whibh buys up and
destroys dilapidated rookeries, and builds, in
their stead, model tenements with wide streets
and every possible facility for comfort and clean-
liness. It builds and maintains seven large model
lodging-houses. The capital expended in these
operations was borrowed at 3J per cent, and
returns 5 per cent. It is also building a Home
for the accommodation of families, chiefly those
in which both parents go out to work, where
the children will be fed and cared for during
the absence of their father and mother, at a
charge of Is. 6d. per week for each child.
Further, the hard-headed city fathers supply
museums, half-a-dozen parks and sundry art-
galleries ; playgrounds, furnished with gym-
nastic apparatus and all kind of games for the
use of poor children ; lectures, Saturday-night
concerts (admission 3d. and Id.) ; and they are
now building a People’s Palace for recreation
purposes in the crowded East End. They con-
trol and pay the local police forces and fire
brigade, maintain the hospitals, and are
steadily extending sewage works which will
ultimately purify all the city sewage and make
the foul and evil-smelling Clyde a pellucid
stream once more. The Corporation buys up
barren lands, fertilises them with the solid pro-
ducts of the sewage • works, and then re-sells
them, and one of its recent transactions in this
line raised the value of one tract of moor by
something like 3000 per cent. It supervises
workshops, factories, and dairies, maintains an
excellent drainage system, cleans the streets
and by-ways, builds its own bridges, and sup-
plies public wash-houses, and swimming and
other baths. These baths are opened free at
certain hours to children attending the
public schools. All this is done out of
a rate of about 2s. 3d. in the £ ren-
tal, and the rate not only covers all
charges but includes payments to various sink-
ing funds. The total debt incurred in con-
structing the water - supply, tramway and
sewage systems, buying up the gas-works, build-
ing new tenements, lodging-houses, town-hall,
museums, art-galleries, wash-houses, swimming
baths, and bridges, opening new streets, buying
up and destroying unwholesome slums, &c.,
was about 10Jj millions, and this liability—de-
spite a steady decrease in rates, a reduction of
60 per cent, in the price of gas, and of about 60
per cent, in the price of water —has already been
reduced by the operation of the sinking-fund
principle to a little over eight millions.
In about half-a-century, it is hoped, the
city will be absolutely free from debt, and then
the profits of the gas, water, electric-lighting
and tramway services will probably go very
near to extinguishing rates altogether. The
people who boost up “ private enterprise,” on
the ground that state and municipal Socialism
is always and of necessity a failure, should
think hard over the results produced in Glas-
gow —likewise those in Manchester, Birming-
ham, Bradford, and other cities, which are
inaugurating a similar policy. If the Aus-
tralian asserts that equally good results can’t
be produced in Australia, then he merely asserts
that he is by nature, or by training, an incom-
petent ass, who hasn’t sense enough to run the
business on commercial principles.

Woman—Old and New.
“ At the baths ” dear to every Australian
youngster, there is always a deep end and a
shallow end. At the deep end you dive in
head-first and swim exultingly : hut, if you
cannot swim, you drown. At the shallow end
you enter feet-first. You need not wet your
head at all, but you can lie on your back and kick
and scream delightfully. The deep end is gener-
ally calm ; the shallow end is the scene of
riotous splashing which first attracts the eye of
the observer, and satisfies the souls of the non-
swimmers who dare not trust themselves beyond
their depth. This is a parable, and here is
the application thereof. The deep end is logic ;
the shallow end is rhetoric. Rhetoric makes
most noise and fuss ; logic is quiet and strong.
With all their bravery of display, the rhetori-
cians know their powers inferior to those of the
swimmers at the other end. But they cannot
swim in argument, and prefer to shriek and
chatter where they are safe rather than take
the risk of drowning in the deep waters of
logic. Now this is the application of the ap-
plication. Woman generically is a rhetorician,
guided by sentiment, intuition, impulse. Man
generically is a logician, relying on induction,
deduction, the lessons of experience, the chain
of cause and effect. There are many rhetorical
men and a few logical women, but the principle
holds in the main. Girls always cluster more
than boys at the shallow end ; kick and splash
more ; are longer in learning to dive from
the deep end. The New Woman, the woman-
suffragist, the shriek-woman, is essentially a
shallow-ender. With rare exceptions, her elo-
quence is mere denunciation of Monster Man,
vague extolment of Virtuous Woman. Now,
Shriek for breakfast, Shriek for dinner, and
Shriek for tea is just as unsatisfactory as the
Toujours Beans of Rue Australia. One’s soul
begins to loathe Shriek, as the souls of the Rue
Australians loathe Beans. There is nothing
to be gained by representing the sexes as
eternally hostile. Even the physiological
opposition is simply a device for completer
union ; the average woman is half a man, as the
average man is half a woman ; and the scientific
imagination goes so far as to declare that every
man is a woman manque, as every woman is a
man spoilt, since each individual contains
the elements of both sexes, and obscure
causes over which the individual has no control
determine at an early period of existence which
set of elements is to become active and obvious
and which to remain passive and hidden. Now,
it is in accordance with the fairly well
ascertained tradition that the best brains
at any given time are on the Tory side (this
involves a very interesting argument not ger-
mane to the present question), that Miss E. A.
Badham, opposing the Shriek-Woman-Suffragist
at last meeting of N.S. W. Economic Associa-
tion, should have dived decisively into the deep
end. Her paper is the most able contribution
to the covs of the woman-suffrage argument
that The Bulletin has seen anywhere ; and,
quite apart from its conclusion, its intrinsic
merit as a piece of argument deserves that it
should be reprinted and widely circulated. But
it is again in accordance with tradition that
the Shriek-Woman should continue to splash
about unconvinced, and the Shriek-Woman
is probably right which involves another
very interesting argument to show that
popular instinct illogieally goes to its mark
in defiance of the most beautifully-constructed
Conservative syllogisms, and that the Conserva-
tives of every generation are ready to admit
that their forbears unluckily failed to notice a
vital flaw in their beautiful premisses. For
Miss Badham’s conclusion is simply this : that
a large number of women do not wish for the
suffrage, and are justified in refusing to take it.
But she does not show, and perhaps does not
desire to show, that the number of women,
small or large, who do wish for the
suffrage, should not have it if they can
get it. Some women do not think with Miss
Badham; therefore, for Miss Badham, some
women are wrong, and she gives many good
reasons to prove them wrong. Miss Badham
does not think with some women ; therefore, for
some women, Miss Badham is wrong, and they
give many good shrieks to prove her wrong.
But—and here is Miss Badham’s flaw —the
shriekers are on a higher ethical platform than
the logician, for they cry for justice, while she
reasons to expediency. Miss Badham’s right
is right for her, but her opponents’ right is
equally right for them ; and in looking
for an absolute national criterion of right,
we must look to justice rather than to expe-
diency. And there is a plain argument from
justice (which Miss Badham does not touch)
that the average woman is, or with a little
training would be, quite as well qualified to
govern herself as the average man. Therefore,
if she wishes for a share in the government,
give it to her; if she doesn’t wish for it, let her
leave it alone. Let expediency, if she chooses,
rule her conduct in relation to herself: justice
her conduct in relation to her fellows.
“Natural” Industries.
One of the results of the sugar-tax controversy
is an inrush of correspondence in the Sydney
daily press pointing out that cane-growing is a
purely exotic occupation in New South W ales,
and one which should be discontinued in the
public interest. The climate, even in the
Northern districts of the province, is alleged
to be too cold, and this and various other cir-
cumstances go to show that sugar production,
under present conditions, is not a “ natural ”
industry, or one which can hold its own, except
by extraneous assistance. Therefore, a large
number of voluminous individuals urge that
this allegedly profitless business should be
abandoned, and the few thousand people who
live by it should take to some natural industry —
some business which is so excellently adapted
to the country that it can live and prosper and
compete against niggers, Chinamen, cheap
Europeans and others under pure Freetrade
conditions. And The Bulletin here rises
to ask, with a loud voice, what is
the name of that “ natural ” industry ?
Even if the whole province was turned into a
sheep-walk it wouldn’t afford sufficient employ-
ment for the male population of New South
Wales, and, besides, wool is becoming every year
less profitable. Wheat-growing cannot be set
down with certainty as a “ natural” industry ;
its existence was always precarious under Free-
trade conditions, and there are any number of
countries which can produce wheat at far
lower cost. Coal-mining, so far as the export
trade is concerned, is unnatural, as evidenced
by the fact that Japanese coal and Japanese
cheap-labor are everywhere cutting out the
Australian miner. Gold-mining, as shown by
the miserable profits of most New South W T ales
goldfields, as compared with those of Victoria
and Queensland and South Africa, is only
moderately “ natural” at the best, and it can’t
employ any very large number of workers with
profit. Apart from wool and fruit-growing and
silver-mining—which, all combined, can’t keep
the province alive— The Bulletin doesn’t know
of one absolutely natural New South Wales
industry, in the Foreign - trade accepta-
tion of the term that is to say, one
industry in which the province can hold its
own against the competition of foreign cheap-
labor and the steadily-diminishing cost of land
and sea carriage—and even fruit-growing is not
a matter of certainty. Most of the industries
which formerly existed under alleged Freetrade
conditions did so because they were heavily
protected by the high rate of freight then exist-
ing, but as freights go down the list of “natural”
industries is steadily reduced till it threatens to
vanish altogether. Therefore, when it is urged
that the exotic sugar-trade shall be abolished,
and the people who live by it shall live by sud-
denly becoming experts in some entirely new
trade which isn’t over-crowded, and which can
live in free competition against the nigger who
is rich on ss. a week and every other rival, The
Bulletin badly wants to know the name and
address of that trade. Are there now even
three really and truly and wholly “natural”
industries in all the temperate regions of Aus-
tralia ?
Obiter Dicta.
Editor Bulletin, —The missionary of paradox
to the English-speaking peoples is dead. His
death is a living paradox ; for the lily of the
city will now toil and spin and yet not be
gloriously arrayed. The death of Oscar Wilde
is sad, not only from pity for the man, but from
pity for literature. His corpse will be gibbeted
on the Via Scholastics as a solemn sermon for
dulness. He patterned after the French, and
wrote to show the Teuton a new possibility of
the pen ; hereafter his style is to be associated
with his shame to scare the writer from new
paths. This will be done by dull and pious
people to whom wit is a real danger. Wilde
alive strove well for a new literature ; Wilde,
dead in his oakum, will push back with strong
force other—possibly better and brighter—
workers in the same field. Sad is the death —
and yet sadder its manner. The man has been
hacked down by the conventions which he
outraged. A wholly mistaken idea of law
—an unripeness of legislation —is the cause
of his fall. He was a sinner; judged by a
normal, healthy-minded standard, a vile sinner.
But the law should not deal with sinners but with
the outragers of the rights of others. It is no
business of the human code to punish vileness;
if so, why are some of the horrors of monopoly
and adultery and poverty and prostitution un-
heeded? Of old. Parliaments and powers
deemed it their duty to uphold the Decalogue
and to roast people into Heaven. Modern en-
lightenment tends to leave to reason or religion
the maintenance of morality, and to reserve for
law the mere keeping of order. Such is the
logic of legislation ; but it has not yet been
fully recognised. A year or two hence Oscar
Wilde would be flouted by decency, but be of
no more interest to the policeman than was
Socrates or Sallust or Alcibtades or Horace
to the law-keeners of their time. The man will
probably never crawl out of his prison ; if he
should, he will then see that he died two years
before because of one of the last limitations
ivhich convention had set upon the logic of
legislation. —F. R.
[The Bulletin has received about 40 letters to this
effect, and it prints the above to satisfy a certain class
of correspondents and to enable it to remark that
Wilde's “new literature” was not so valuable that its
extinction among the oakum should matter much. And
the law had a right to squash Wilde as an “outrnger of
the rights of others.” It is the right of every callow
youth not to be exposed, it the law can help it, to the evil
influence and example of a dirty-minded fat man. Wilde
was, in a moral sense, a dead oat in an alley, and the
Sanitary Department got on to him, which it had every
right to do. —Ed. B.]

Dear Bulletin, —In a recent par. yon make
some assertions which seem at variance with
existing legislation. Yon say: “If Baronet
Newnes stole or received valuable stolen
literary matter taken from an English paper he
would have to pay damages; but as Miss
Turner happens to be an Australian writing
for Australian papers she cannot claim the pro-
tection of the English Copyright Law; for
English copyright applies to all English pos-
sessions, and so runs in Australia ; Australian
copyright is not operative in England.” This
is hardly in accord with the provisions of the
International Copyright Act (1886), by which it
is enacted that the Copyrights Acts shall apply
to a literary or artistic work first produced in a
British possession in like manner as they apply
to a work first produced in the United

jargon) (a) that it shall not be required to be

(6) that no copy of the work is required to be
delivered to any person in Great Britain. The
Copyright Acts, I need not explain, give all the
necessary powers to the author or his assignee
to prevent pirating. The colonial copyright
has received a very considerable extension since
the passing of this Act, and it may be posi-
tively stated that a book or any public literary
matter produced in Australia obtains at once
the same copyright throughout the British
dominions that it would have enjoyed if
first produced in the United Kingdom. A
certificate or document purporting to be a
true copy $r extract from the register of
copyrights in a British possession, signed by the
officer keeping the register and authenticated
by the Public Seal of the British possession or
by an official seal or signature of a Governor or
Minister, is admissable as evidence, and all
courts (throughout the British dominions) shall
take judicial notice of it and admit it without
further proof. The British accession to the
Berne Convention or International Copyright
Union carries the colonies en bloc into that
union, and authors in the British possessions
have protection or copyright practically
throughout the world. All that would be re-
quired to enable The Bulletin to sit upon
Baronet Newnes is the authenticated certificate
of copyright referred to above and proof of
publication. Any court in Great Britain then
would do the rest. Why does not some per-
sistent young barrister take up this interesting
branch of law ?— Fred. Walsh.

There is so much Irish drama in this
world that an impression is beginning to prevail
that Ireland spreads over three-fourths of Europe
and Asia, and is peopled by 10,000,000 evicted
farmers, 5,000,000 hard - hearted landlords,
60,000,000 humpbacked informers and process-
servers, and 100,000,000 colleens, bog-trotters,
pigs, squireens, priests and policemen. Maggie
Moore’s new drama, “Sweet Innisfail,” is rather
better than most of its kind, however, and Miss
Moore’s adorable accent lends it an unwonted air
of realism. It begins with a farmer who is cast
out'by a gouty despot because he can’t pay the
rint. One of his daughters is secretly married to
the son of the gouty marauder, while the other is
engaged to a brilliant youth whose sole visible
means of support are a red waistcoat. The son
gets midnight skull-fracture in a cave and
becomes a lost wanderer without a memory.
The farmer and his two girls starve in a
cabin till the old man takes to an aimless
kind of sheep-stealing, accompanied with tears
and general decay of the legs. The youth in the
red waistcoat has a number of gaudy fights with
the police, routs the gouty landlord in a rough-
and-tumble scrimmage, drives off 18 armed
Fenians, casts the squireen into a lake, also
wallops him, and arrests him ; likewise, he gags
the process-server, hangs him once or twice, drags
him a considerable distance over a rough country,
throws him through a window, captures him in a
wood, and kicks him frequently. And at last the
process-server finds the incriminating documents
in the squireen’s coat, and the mad girl recovers,
and the skull - fractured man who was lost is
found again, and the landlord is shot at, and the
hero’s cabin is burned, and the process-server is
tarred and feathered, and the squireen is arrested,
and the drama wins in a canter, and they all live
happily ever afterwards.
* • •
The honors rest mainly with Miss Maggie
Moore, Miss Lynda Raymond (a new addition to
the co.), Mr. Roberts, and the process-server.
Maggie is as good as she always is; the new lady
promises well, though her want of anything
resembling an Irish accent makes her seem a very
improbable sister to Miss Moore, whose brogue is
the loveliest thing of its kind that ever grew in
all the wide region from Ballyhooley to Killaloe ;
and the versatile Roberts is good all round. Oily
Deering’s process-server is humpbacked and has
amjmpediment in his legs, as a matter of course—
all process-servers and informers are built that
way. But, in addition, he is about the most
original and refreshing crawler who ever rushed
on one short leg and a long one through the
domain of Irish drama. “Sweet Innisfail” is a
large, vigorous, rousing production of its own
peculiar kind, though it gets hurried and inco-
herent towards the end ; and it is adorned with
several really beautiful scenes, and one which isn’t
beautiful and looks like a mountain of raw beef
with a tree sticking out of it sideways,

ISS T lO (Mrs. Joseph Tapley),
smger of many past operas
ar >d one °i the prettiest and most promising of
Australian actresses, died in Melbourne last Sun-
day. She had a short and brilliant career of about
six years, during which time she played a large
number of important parts, and played them all

“ Mam’zelle Nitouche,” the
story of the good girl of the con-
vent-school who goes out “on a
tear ” and drinks more champagne
than is good for her, and goes on
the stage, and disguises herself in
boy’s clothes while her accomplice,
the organist, gets drunk and has
his hair cut, ought to be good for
much longer than a week at
the Lyceum. On its last appear-
ance this opera was powerfully
supported by the “Living Pic-
tures,” but the present experience
shews that it can hold its own
without the aid of an apparently
nude female in a big gilt frame.
“ Mam’zelle ” is not so much an
opera as a comedy set to music.
Nellie Stewart and the organist
have a most awful night out, and
get back over the garden wall in
the early morning, much after
the fashion of the “ Magistrate ”
when he had been chased by
police and stray dogs over half
London. This isn’t especially
original, for half the comedies in
existence consist in a good man
coming home with a bashed hat
and a black eye in the early
morning, and explaining matters
at great length ; but Nellie
Stewart’s bad girl comes home
looking fresh and dainty, and gets
back into her convent dress, and
puts her bright young head
under the tap, and is all the
better for her experiences. As
for organist Lauri, he is an amus-
ing wreck and a dreadful example
of _ the evils of the accursed
drink. Apart from these two,
nobody matters very much. A
few other characters bear a hand,
but Nellie and the oppressed
organist and a ballet of eight are
practically the whole show. The
Bulletin mentions with regret
that “La Cigale ” will take the place of
“ Nitouche ” on Saturday.

The “ County Wicklow,” at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney), has the merit of being exactly like every
other Irish drama that ever existed. There is
nothing in all this world which has quite so much
sameness in it as the Irish drama. All the charac-
ters begin with “ O.” There is a camel-shaped
informer, with one bow-leg and one knock-knee ;
the primitive Irish huiuor can only express the
moral crookedness of the informer by making him
a toad-like wreck. Also, there are a fine old man,
a holy father, some soldiers, two beautiful girls, a
noble-hearted rebel, and a good deal of whisky.
The rebel is a tiresome person, who never does
anything in particular, and who talks like a burse
cistern about Ireland ; he can’t even eat half-a-
slioe of bread without rising between each bite to
make a column or two of remarks to the effect
that Ireland will yet be free. The consequence is,
that he doesn’t get a chance to digest his food pro-
perly ; no man could digest properly who always
gets up with his mouth full and the crust
in his hand to state that his bleeding coun-
try will rise again at some date not yet
fixed. Some day, The Bulletin is going to
express its feelings on this great subject by writ-
ing an Irish drama of its own. In it the rebel will
not make one eloquent remark about Ireland all
through, and will have a chance to get his meals
properly : there will be no whisky ; the colleen
will be a plain girl with bare feet, and there will
be twelve handsome informers, which is probably
about the right proportion. Also, the pig, which
seems to be unaccountably omitted, will be a lead-
ing character; and the hero will be justly hanged
for being a bore and a weary repetition, and for
always being on the point of doing something and
never doing it.

Be Charles Erin Yerner, The Bulletin
has come to the conclusion that the greatest Irish
comedian is a most over-rated person. J. W.
Sweeney, as the informer, bears the heat and
burden of the grammar, and never appeared to
such advantage as when alongside the exceedingly
unconvincing Yerner. The other characters
tackle their brogue with more or less success, and
speak feelingly about whisky, and deliver long
essays about their bleeding country, and keep the
top buttons of their shirts unfastened, after the
manner of the true patriot, whose swelling bosom
would otherwise blow that top button off with a
loud report. The very latest news is that Mr.
Yerner has sprained himself and will give the
public a well-earned rest, and that that really fine
drama, “My Partner,” will be staged on
Saturday.

Smythe’s latest lion, the Rev. Haskett
Smith, who roars at present in Sydney Y.M.O. A.
Hall, is a joyous old parson who has seemingly
lost a good deal of his orthodoxy in the course of
many years’ exploration of Palestine and Syria.
He is alleged to have spent 25 years in delving
among the mysteries of that sacred and rather
dirty land, and he knows it thoroughly from one
end to the other. There is very little of it at the
best, but what there is seemingly full of old
ruins, broken walls, traditions, lying guides,
and flies buzzing round dead camels. The
lectures are illustrated with innumerable views,
and these views do much to knock the reverence
out of the business. The utter poverty, squalor and
melancholy commonplace of blighted Palestine,
the horrible resemblance of its towns to the
Chinese quarter of a decayed goldfield, the gloom
of the scorched and yellow land, and the blank
The Late VIOLET VARLEY.
misery of Jerusalem—that little city that slum-
bers at the far end of a by-road which leads no-
where—all stand out conspicuously. Parson
Smith doesn’t attempt to emphasise these matters,
but they loom up none the less, and, after hearing
that learned orator, The Bulletin’s desire to
roam over the Holy Land is dead beyond hope of
resurrection.

Mr. William Walshe, the young Australian
tenor, better known as “Billy,” to whom the
Sydney profession are giving a benefit prior to his
departure for America, is a native of Melbourne,
a large and once-flourishing town in one of the
adjacent provinces—near Geelong. For a long
time he drove a quill in Melb. Water Supply De-
partment. Acquired some fame also as a
cricketer, playing for E. Melb. Played for Yic.
against the first Australian Eleven. Was a pupil
of Mme. Lucy Chambers, the famous teacher of
singing, and sang with the Melb. Metropolitan
Liedertafel and Philharmonic Society. Made his
operatic debut at Melb. Princess’, with the Emelie
Melville opera 00., as principal tenor in “Fati-
mbza,” and, after playing a round of operas with
them in Australia, accompanied them to India,
China, and Japan, where, with the dashing
Emelie, Yerdi, and Farley, they coined money.
Walshe remained in the East two years. Returned
to Sydney, and sang the tenor music to Sullivan’s
“Golden Legend,” with the Sydney Philhar-
monic, and the “ Messiah,” with Mme. Patey.
He oannot remember how often he has sung for
various charitable objects all over Australia. He
leaves for America per Alameda, after the benefit
concert next Saturday, June 6. He is six feet
high, and every inch an Australian, has a good
quality of voice, and all those who know him wish
him well. Australia is a place for good tenors to
get away from. We always export our best, and
get shoddy in return—in music as in commodities.

If the Melb. theatrical carnival of ’94 was
disappointing to some people, who wanted a more
tangible entertainment than they got for their
two shillings entrance-fee, last week’s show, at
Melb. Exhibition, made up the shortage. The
gate-money was only one shilling, and the nimble
“bob’’went a long way. Iu the concert hall a
variety-show was available for anyone who could
get there; a programme of sports, commencing
with a children’s race and ending with a costume
football orgie, kept the quadrangle crowded from
two to five o’clock. Until four o’clock, or so, it
was even possible to make a round of the
pavilions, and get occasional glimpses of Beauty
without paying a sixpence toll. Blanche Massey
and Florence Lloyd were included in the legiti-
mate shillingsworth of joy all the time, and this
for sound financial reasons. They conducted a
Monte Carlo establishment, with the assistance of
three other ladies, and pushed the sale of metal
tickets over a circular counter. Blanche Massey,
with her fair young head tilted to one side, and a
besee.-hing smile in her business eye, travelled
round and round the inner ring lisping “Two
shillings to win sixteen.” When about 16 metal
tickets had been sold (for 325.) somebody set a
race-game in motion, and the winner got half the
stake at one fell swoop, the other half remaining
to aid the good cause. The tickets were then
gathered in and Florence Lloyd took up the syren
song, “Two shillings to win sixteen!” Monte
Carlo offered no hope for a man who wishes to
break the bank, but it was a very fashionable
slaughtering-place for 3| hours. A more primi-
tive sort of race-game, known as a “ doodlein-
buck,” was on tap elsewhere. Twelve gamblers
staked a shilling apiece. The winner netted six
shillings profit and the doodlembuck carried over a
balance of six shillings to its next account with
no more compunction than a bookmaker feels
under similar circumstances. However, the girl
who gathered in the spoil was nice enough to eat,
which Ikey Mo isn’t.

The main hall of the Exhibition Building
contained 11 pavilions, large or smaller, so there
wasn’t too much space left for several thousand
visitors to walk about in. Important personages
found themselves shoving one another unortho-
doxieally in the main hall. James Service and
Justice Webb got jammed at the opening to
Decima Moore’s pav., along with the sheriff’s
officer, who had come to the Carnival on the off-
chance of being able to stick a formal demand for
“costs” into a certain divorce-court petitioner.
Lady Clarke and her pretty daughter were so
tightly drawn into a vortex of influential citizens
on the threshold of Louis Bradfield’s enclosure
that they had to enter “on the nod” and pay
when they came out, Lady C.’s credit being
good at charity fairs. It cost a shilling at
first and two shillings as time wore on
to hear Bradfield give a few imitations of
actors and sing a little in his private tent. He
wasn’t an “astounding bargain” at the price,
although he had a splendid sale. In the tent
immediately opposite Johnny Gourlay and Co.
played the fool at brief intervals for sixpence, and
Benno Soherek, the musician, treated waiting
audiences to some of his card-tricks. Scherek’s
tricks leave a smell of brimstone behind them.
One feels that the gifted Pole may be called for
at any minute by a tall, dark gentleman in a red
suit. At four o’clock or thereabouts, the rush of
humanity to the choicest Beauty pavilions was
arrested by a well-thought-out system of sixpence
to go in. Maud Hobson’s bower was free to gentle-
men because that stately Hebe dispensed drinks
from a bottle, and the male sex is supposed to
mean business when it sniffs pizen. Ladies had
to pay sixpence for the privilege of viewing Maud
at close quarters, also they ran a serious risk of
being lured into ordering lemonade at a shilling
per glass. Consequently, they preferred, as a
rule, to stay outside and gnash their little teeth.
Grace Palotta, in another shop, sold tea and cake,
therefore women were allowed to gaze upon her
gratis, whilst men dropped another sixpence into
the fund. Miss Palotta’s pavilion seemed to be
the particular haunt of coupon-sellers. The
pleasure of buying a Beauty Prize coupon was
intense. You got one for sixpence, and, having
got it, filled in the name of your idol and posted
the document in a box. No charge for postage.

The Doll House and Richardson’s Show
panned out well, especially the latter. This was
a gorgeous entertainment for sixpence, and Bland
Holt took the money at the doors. They
played “ Hamlet ” to crowded houses as often as
they liked in Richardson’s. The tragedy always
opened with an apology from Harry Monkhouse,
who regretted to mention that the melancholy
Dane’s tights wouldn’t fit anybody larger than
little Fred Kaye. Soon afterwards the company
came on and died, all of them save Hamlet’s
mother. She had retired to nurse a grievance
against the management. The old lady was an
Ophelia of 40 years standing, and for the first
time in her life Monkhouse had asked her to play
the Queen. Actors and actresses in all directions
worked hard to make their theatrical carnival go,
A good deal of the money taken within the build-
ing was the reward of sustained effort. The
side-showmen pegged away steadily, and the
people who had created and arranged the whole
business travelled around to see that it was good,
and the final result was a profit exceeding .£lOOO.

The Gaiety Co. having vacated Melbourne
Princess’s on Friday night, and a verdict of tem-
porary insanity having been recorded against a
mob of shattered old johnnies who saw them off,
the B. and B, Co. took the stage on Saturday.
Melbourne had not quite recovered from its bad
attack, so there were a few seats to spare in court
when “ The Case of Rebellious Susan ” was called.
Susan’s case didn’t promise to overcrowd the
court at any future time. It is neither very
dramatic, nor strikingly humorous, nor full of
moral instruction, yet it seems to express a pro-
found belief in its own importance, like all plays
by H. A. Jones and Ibsen ;
That’s about the size of Susan’s case. She
set out with the intention of “ carrying on,” and
when the inevitable lover had hugged her, on
their way home from church, she was horribly
afraid that the gentleman might brag about
it. She thought she desired to assert a principle,
whereas she probably wanted an ordinary co-
respondent, who denies everything that has hap-
pened, on oath. Author Jones doesn’t appear
quite certain that his heroine wanted as much as
this, and he brings her back to her husband for the
sole reason that the story wouldn’t be pretty if bn
left the unsatisfactory rebel wandering about at
Poor rebellious Sue
Laughed at what was due,
Due to cold propriety, in a warm sassiety.
When her husband went astray,
Lady Susan ran away;
Took a trip abroad,
Spooned on Cecil Ward ;
Sentimental, flighty Sue
Had a mind to try a new
Masculine variety.
Poor rebellious Sue,
In a year or two —
Funking notoriety, viewing with dubiety
Love of an “ illicit ” kind,
Got a chance to change her mind.
Cecil went astray,
Much to her dismay.
Accidental-convert Sue
Started married life anew—
Settled down to piety.
Had Cecil Ward been true
To rebellious Sue,
Soothing her anxiety, whims, and contrariety,
Then she might have stayed abroad
Snorting at her lanky lord,
Till in legal course
He obtained divorce,
Leaving her to live a life
Commonplace, as Cecil’s wife,
Wearied by satiety.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone wjio mak. s
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats
large. Another sample of wife is introduced—an
uproarious, ginger-headed innovator who preaches
a new morality to the women of Oiapham, and
commits penal offences against law’norder.
“ Ginger ” is the author’s excuse for asserting that
woman’s true sphere of usefulness is her own
fireside, which ancient saw issues from the
mouth of a moral philosopher, one Cato, Q.O.
with an aggressive air of being new and original.
But the question of woman suffrage, &c., is not
affected by the vagaries of a casual Clapham
lunatic. “The Case of Rebellious Susan” is a
bright little play, all the same, and if the character
of Susan’s husband were tolerably well acted the
general effect might be almost impressive.

Mr. Dorrington is a very young man in an
unthankful part, and he walks through his hope-
less task with despair writ large upon his legs,
Miss Noble, as the heroine, is Miss Noble at her
best in a character which hangs rather loosely
about her narrow style. The ability of Tither-
adge and Boucicault is even more than usually
conspicuous. Miss Temple scores a few notches,
and Miss Faber’s excellent performance will make
her a Melbourne favorite immediately.

“The Union Jack” is re-appearing at
Melbourne Royal, after an absence of six years.
It re-appears to much better advantage than
before in several respects, and has only one very
weak spot. Miss Housley, late of “The New
Boy ” Co., is unequal to the sad responsibilities of
the girl who’s been betrayed. Slow music doesn’t
harmonise with Miss Housley’s stage walk, nor
has grief marked her for its own. The ex-board-
ing-school miss is about two feet shorter than the
average height of a villain’s dupe, and a good
hearty curse would blow her away. Edith Blande,
in a long, melancholy cloak, is the true type of be-
trayed womanhood for melodramatic purposes ; n~
other type fills the bill. There are two active and
intelligent monsters of infamy in “The Union
Jack.” One of them holds the other in
subjection with forged papers, until the hero
tikes a flying leap from captivity through
the open port of a man-o’-war ship, and
surprises the first villain in a drawing-room at
midnight. When the hero has shaken his hated
rival like a dawg he goes away, whereupon the
second villain stabs his colleague, recovers the
incriminating papers, and charges hero Baker
with the gory deed. Baker is somehow saved
from the gallows, by Mr. and Mrs. Bland Holt,
and marries a ward of the wicked corpse, whose
other ward has been suffering persecution from
the real murderer. Or else it was the murderer
who had the two fair wards, and the corpse that
assisted him to plot against the men they loved.
Anyway, the grave closes over both of them after
the other one gets hanged for his crime. Miss
Hilda Spong is earnest and vigorous, as well as
sweet, on this occasion, whilst Miss Virgie Vivienne
is equally charming within light comedy limits.
W alter Baker’s nobi! ity of character i s only exceeded
by his muscular strength at a crisis, and the twin
pyramids of iniquity are feelingly represented by
Albert Norman and Cosgrove. Familiarity with
crime has hardened A. Norman considerably of
late years. His scowl improves steadily, and his
moustache is full of evil. Bland Holt shares a
large slice of the drama with his sweetheart, Mrs.
Holt, an interloping soldier (Charles Brown)
coming in for a few of the crumbs. “ The Union
Jack ’’is strong in comic relief and scenery, and
all that makes melodrama lively. Also, it shows
signs of having been partly constructed by the
literary hand of Sydney Grundy.

Mr. Clifford Halle’s lectures on “ Singing
as an Art,” at the Athenaeum Hall, have fully
justified their deliverance. Clifford Halle talks
of matters he understands in an entertaining way,
and at the conclusion of a lucid address he gets
his precepts home to the hearts of his hearers by
showing them how he himself can interpret a few
test ballads. Mr. Halle’s singing is the best en-
couragement that a student can receive, inasmuch
as the professor’s voice seems to be quite
an ordinary baritone organ brought to a high
state of perfection. Halle, phre, the pianist,
implored his accomplished offspring to go to Aus-
tralia and impress upon the rising songsters of
this country the necessity for hard graft; and
echoes his parent’s opinion that Australia
will produce plenty of fine singers when the gene-
ral desire to “come out ” and shout, after three
months’ tuition, has been sobered down into a
determination to Work. There is no “ haw ”
about Clifford Halle, for an artist who preaches
Work, with a capital W, has never yet been
known to “ haw ” in this world.

The two new performers from America
made their appearance at Melb. Opera House on
Saturday, and proved themselves much less un-
paralleled than was expected. Things are some-
what cheerful at the Bijou, but the Cambridge
has closed its doors and relapsed into silence.
At Poverty Point.
Lalla Miranda’s accent, when she sang at a private
concert in Paris, was voted “rather agreeable than other-
wise ” by a critical French audience. Every sort of
foreign accent has a charm if nicely' rendered, even when
the speaker is dealing with his, or her, own language. A
cultivated Bostonian talks the brightest English, and a
ditto Britisher talks the brightest American. A provin-
cial turn of the tongue can please a metropolitan ear all
the world over, vice versa. Isn’t that so?
A dramatic co. lately returned to Melb. per boat after
doing such a “perish ” that when the leading lady sud-
denly fainted the whole funds of the 00. weren’t sufficient
to buy her a glass of brandy.
Carmencita, the Spanish dancer, now starring in London,
has a curious notion of the duties of a manager or agent.
Having had occasion to complain of some press criticisms,
she ordered her agent (Leopold Jordan, erstwhile of
Sydney) to go at once and thrash the editors. But Mr.
Jordan didn’t.
(( Dear Bulletin, —The most graphic touch in that little
“In Town ” scene has been unnoticed. The captain gets
a bundle of letters. He rejects all as duns—except one,
addressed in a female hand. In apparent confirmation of
the idea that there is a lady in the envelope the captain
discovers it is perfumed. Then, of course, he opens it—
to find he has been “ had ” by a clever creditor.—F.
It seems that the bilious Gilbert had fair reason
for his last quarrel with Sullivan. There was a nice
girl in the case. A revival of “Mikado” was under
consideration, and Gilbert proposed to bestow the part of
Yum-Yum upon his friend Miss Nancy M’lntosh. Sullivan
and p’Oyley Carte scouted the idea. Gilbert went away
in his wrath to find a new musical collaborateur, and
wrote “ His Excellency ” for the main purpose of giving
Nancy a good show. Nancy is a success. Gilbert has
never made a really bad choice of an artist for a leading
part, so the wmnder is that Sullivan and Carte came to
loggerheads with him.
The Bellew-Potter combination is pure biz. When they
reached London, from Australia, they put on Bellew’s
translation of “Hero and Leander,” and Mrs. P. failed,
whereupon Bellew dissolved partnership, took a part at
the Adelphi, did not succeed mightily, and so took up
the partnership again, and Mrs. P. knows exactly how
much money there is in Curly Harold.
An ingenious writer in a Melb. paper says that the
French lozenges now on the market, which contain
essence of whisky, brandy, gin, &c., will do away with the
necessity of going out between the acts to “ see a man.”
Absurd ! Most of the time men go out in order to be able
to curse the play, and particularly damn certain of the
actors, and criticise with more or less delicacy the legs of
the actresses. Besides, even if this were not so, the state-
ment referred to is unreasonable. Where is the lozenge
that will give the essence of a long beer?
Another example of the fact that men are far more
modest than women, writes a Bulletin correspondent. At
the evenings of Melb. Shakespe . ; Society, when unex-
purgated plays of the immortal Lard are read by a num-
ber of the members of both sexes, each impersonating a
character, the men on reaching any dubious passage im-
mediately Bowdlerise the text by skipping the lively por-
tion , or, if not quick enough to notice what is coming,
they read the words in an undertone amid blushes and
with obvious confusion. Not so with the women. With-
out the slightest nervousness they go straight ahead and,
giving full value to the expressions, declaim them in, if
anything, a louder tone than the accompanying unblush-
ful letterpress. [Accounted for by the absolute innocence
and guueiessness of the women.— Ed. B.]
Dainty Decima Moore’s stage appearance is somewhat
marred by her odd habit of bending forward when she
walks, and holding her head down so that her face is
always hidden from the audience.
A young and pretty actress in Maoriland still bears
uppn her cheeks the teeth-marks lately inflicted by a
jealous lady who ascertained that the former had ac-
cepted a bouquet from her, the latter’s, husband. An
assault summons issued was allowed to lapse.
Dear Bulletin,— Melb. critics fairly yelled with delight
over “In Town,” and called W. and M. to book for not
putting this on first. There is positively no righteous
excuse for this beyond Bradfield's gentlemanly and clever
clowning, and for that they' were content to sacrifice the
unctuous Monkhouse, Kay, Bantock (the latter tw>o do
nothing in particular in “In Town ”) Maud Hobson, and
Grace Palotta—all delightful entities in “The Gaiety
Girl.” Misses Hobson and Palotta are merely visionsin the
later production. The literary material in “The Gaiety
Girl” is smart, that of “In Town” mere shoddy—not a
line worthy of quotation marks in a mile of it. The fact
is London critics enthused persistently over “In Town ”
as the first of its kind, and the Melb. critic’s opinions are
always imported ready-made—he is the least self-opinion-
ated man in creation.—Yours, Skull.
Why blame lessees or managers for bursts-up of

Several Melh. suburban ball proprietors object to the
various juvenile minstrel co.’s playing- in their halls on
the “silver coin ” principle, on the ground that it lowers
the status of the halls by causing roughs to congre-
gate. At South Yarra, where the manager of a juvenile co.,
who had been showing locally to crowded “ silver coin ”
houses, made a direct charge of 6d. all round, in accord-
ance with the hall-proprietor’s instructions, only 85
people attended, and the show closed down.
Dan Barry tours Melh. suburbs with the old “ drama by
Rev. O. H. Spurgeon ’’—authorship of which the great
Tabernacler once took the trouble to disavow to a Q.
Baptist whose faith was shocked by Dan’s advt. The
cute Barry’s little eccentricities were duly retailed by
Smythe, and figure in Max O'Rell’s book on Australia.
Bellew has a yarn about Mrs. Potter, in India, being so
absorbed as Lady Macbeth in the somnambulic - scene,
that she never noticed a vampire-bat which settled on her
arm and absorbed her blood, till she fainted. All this,
however, is possibly only an allegory. Perhaps the
vampire-bat was Bellew.
The crush to see the Gaiety Co. during the last few
nights of Melb. Princess season was so great that police-
men had to be called in to keep the crowd back. Even
deadhead pressmen were refused standing room.

W. J. Wilson, who “ benefits ” presently in Sydney, in

actor of country yokels. He played as an amateur in the

Coppin re-opened the “ Old Iron-pot ” —the Olympic—in
Lonsdale-street after his rupture with Brooke. Rogers,
Richard Younge, Tom Bellair and wife, Wilson, Russell,
Rosa Dunn and other good names were in the bill. Rosa
Dunn (Mrs. L. L. Lewis) and Mr. Wilson are the only ones
now living.
Billy Elton’s Adelaide season was almost a failure. He
was supported by a weak co., and even then they did not
show their legs. A moral drama, with several passages
conveying a frisky interpretation, played by ladies in
tights, is the thing wanted in the pious village. Adelaide
saints always want revelations.
Dear Bulletin, —“8.E.” in “ Poverty Point ” writes :
” It is not a fact that the Leopold Bros, use an invisible

Mrs. Edmund Phelps, the duchess of “In Town,” never
acted under her connubial name until after the death
of her famous father-in-law, Sara Phelps, 16 years ago.
She had been long a widow when that happened. In
the old days of Webster and Chatterton’s management at
the Adelphi and Princess’s, Mrs. P. was known as Miss
Hudspeth. She played all sorts of characters creditably
—lrish heroines, comic slaveys, or Jack Sheppard, in the
antique drama. As comic slavey she could sometimes
force a laugh from old man Phelps, starring in the same
company, and he didn’t easily lose his countenance on
the stage. Besides, he couldn’t forgive her for having
married son Edmund without his (Samuel’s) permission.
All things considered, she must have been very funny.

Dear Bulletin,—" M.” says he knows how Oscar Wilde
does his “factory-made epigrams,” and he doesn’t like
them, anyhow. Why doesn’t “ M.” publish a couple of
gross to prove he understands the mechanism? Was it
“ M.” who originated the remark that Hamlet is only a
collection of popular sayings ? “ M.” tries to depreciate
Oscar Wilde’s success as a playwright by cheap allusions
to the French —“ M.’s ” depreciation is the sincerest form
of flattery. Oscar Wilde and Israel Zangwill have given
an epigrammatic tone to English literature. An epigram
proves the unfamiliarity of the obvious—and when some
wit says: “To be intelligible is to be found cut” it is
easy for little critics to pooh-pooh. An epigram is the
nexus between the preposterous unreliability of Fact and
the reasonableness of Fiction ; a small round stone from
the brook Life slung by an expert hand at some Goliath
not of Gath ; an octopus with its gloves on ; an arrow
pointed by pessimism and fledged by optimism ; a sweet
cynicism, a convincing absurdity, a triumphant soap-
bubble. There is a market for “ M.’s ” epigr: ,ms so that
they be made in the factory where Oscar Wilde makes his.
But this is not “M.’s” business. Oscar Wilde may be
pecked at by daws now—and the fear is that “ M.,” hav-
ing had a peck, may want a quart. In the meantime,
here is a Wildeism for “ M.” to beat from the French or
from his own magnificent mind: “There are only two
tragedies in life—one is not getting the thing one wants—
the other is getting it.”—N.

And so the great King of the Lyceum would appear to

George Bernard Shaw, in Saturday Review: “I have

duties, to write corrupt puffs of the editor’s personal
friends, with full liberty, in return, to corruptly puff my
own; and, in the other, because my sense of style revolted
against the interpolation in my articles of sentences
written by the proprietor’s wife to express her high
opinions of artists unknown to fame and me, who had won
her heart by their hospitality.”

“ Charley’s Aunt ” has been played in Europe,

7500 times. Penley has only a lease of it for seven
years, with the option of continuance for a short further
term. After that it reverts to Brandon Thomas, who has
kept nearly all rights but the English, and (The Bulle-
tin’s London correspondent believes) Australian. Penley
and Brandon are not such warm friends as they might be,
but they don’t openly quarrel. The bone of contention
is Penley’s story of his part in making it the success it
has been by cuts and additions. Brandon’s tale is quite
a different one. “I alone did it,” is the burthen of his
song. Anyhow, “ somebody ” did it, and did it very
well, making a much finer gold-mine than the London-
derry.

tears. It now remains for the British Dramatic Associa-

London is so touchingly moral and proper that Oscar
Wilde’s plays are now quite tabooed, writes The Bulletin’s
correspondent. During the last few night of “The Im-
portance of Being Earnest,” the house was almost empty,
and, at the Criterion, “ An Ideal Husband ” is to be with-

The premier of “ Baron Golosh,” at London Trafalgar,
went off rather shyly, says The Bulletin’s London corres-

for her in the way of jewellery. She fairly blazed with
diamonds.
The cruel scandal of the second Synnot
(Melb.) divorce-suit doesn’t affect the question
raised in the first suit. Synnot originally sought
to break the tie that kept him from marrying a
wife who would live with him, by producing evi-
dence that he is now married to one who will not
live with him. Twenty-two years ago Synnot,
admittedly “excited ” at the time, slapped Mrs.
Synnot’s face. She left him. He made her a
handsome allowance, after begging her to return
home. Less than a year later he inaugurated a
series of attempts to persuade Mrs. Synnot to
change her mind. No result. Presently Mrs.
Synnot’s lawyer asked for a deed of separation
and a settlement. Synnot offered to*j>ettle his
entire fortune on her if she would return
“home.” Not she. Synnot, “believing he was
acting in the best way to effect a reconciliation,”
signed a deed of separation, by which he settled
.£lO,OOO on the lady he had married. That helped
to settle his chance of getting her hack, presuming
there was a chance remaining up to then. Mrs.
Synnot, with her .£lO,OOO, was adamant. What
he had done for the best proved to have been done
for the worst. From time to time Mrs. Synnot
rejected her husband’s social suit with scorn, and
when he ultimately tried a legal suit tiiat likewise
was a dismal failure. Mrs. Synnot set up the
separation deed, which was an impenetrable
defence for that circumspect matron, and threw
in the ironical complaint that her “ husband
before God ” had committed a lot of adultery since
she (under whatever provocation) put herself
asunder from him in 1873. That is the Synnot
case divested of wild allegations and judicial
hysteria.
There are in Sydney certain gentlemen
who represent the Govt, on the boards of benevo-
lent institutions and are paid fees for their atten-

would be interesting, as nobody seems to be sure
who the gentlemen are, or how much money they
get.
Dear Bulletin, — It is a mistake to think
that, to procure the deportation of an absconder
from justice to Melb. from Sydney, the punish-
ment for tiie alleged crime must be “ a year bard.”
Sec. 13, Part ii., of the Act, enables deportation,
where a warrant has been issued in an adjoining
province, for “an offence punishable by that
colony ” —so that it is possible for a man to be
extradited on a mere chargeof insulting behaviour.
Even an absconding witness in a criminal case can
be extradited. The 12 months’ imprisonment
mentioned only applies to extradition between
N.S.W. and the U.S., or Canada, or Africa.—

Q. Judge Real had a case for decision, the
other day, hinging on a point not unlike the crux
in the famous Q- Investment Co. cases. Ex-Chief
Justice Lilley decided these cases against Arthur
Palmer and Co. to the wrath of the Govt., which
brought Judge Windeyer from Sydney to review
his decision—it was upset. Eng. Lord Chief
Justice Davey, by-tlie-by, afterwards backed up
Lilley, and the only reason the Investment Co.
didn’t proceed with the appeal was that if it
had won it would have lost, seeing that it
had to prove on dummied titles. The point was—
could a valid sale be effected of land conditionally
granted by Govt., when the conditions had not
been fulfilled. Real remarked (following Lilley)
that he thought the sale was invalid, hut shirked
the point by permitting the sale of interest, if any,
without deciding the question of legal title.
That curious tale about the discovery of
the North Pole, by a person whose, name sounds
like a cat-fight beside a waterfall, has seemingly
collapsed, and the world is still left wondering.
The discovery of the Pole is a simple matter, after
all, and the fact that no one has found it is re-
markable. There are two ways of discovering
any place ; one is to go there, and the other is to
come back and say that you have been there. The
Pole will probably be found the latter way. Some
day the solitary survivor of some lost expedition
will straggle in and say that he has been there,
and as there will be no one to contradict him, the
great mystery will be solved there and then, and
the survivor will be knighted and probably get a
pension as well. There is very little chance of
him being bowled out. All he has to state in the
way of description is that he arrived at a place
which was covered with ice and looked like every
other place thereabouts, and that be saw a walrus
in the distance. The Bulletin regretfully
wonders why an Australian doesn’t find the Pole.
There are some fine liars in Australia.
SIN AND SYN-NOT.
Synnot’s wife, a chilly dame,
Is not witii Synnot mated :
Although his money gilds her name,
They’ve long been separated.
Synnot cried, “My Jot is dree
If wifey’s love I win not !”
“No more of married life for me,”
Responded Mrs. Syn-not,
Synnot sued for a divorce,
His missing missus haughty
Discovered what was true, of course—
Poor Synnot had been naughty.
“ This story of your wrongs I pray
You in my ears to din not;
“ Go, sinner, go your evil way !”
Responded Mrs. Syn-not.
Synnot lost a hopeless case,
And, later on, repeated
His vain attempt; but in disgrace
He slunk away defeated.
The lesson of this legal strife
Read, mark, and learn —and grin not.
He cannot wed a proper wife,
Nor live with Mrs. Syn not.
If matrimony’s moral aim
The Church has truly stated,
All husbands really ought to claim
The right of being mated ;
And we, who judge by Nature’s laws,
For lawyers care a pin not,
And find that Synnot sins because
His wife is Mrs. Syn-not.

Society
At the opening of Yic. Parliament, the
“very highest polite sassiety people” carefully
1 uddled themselves together on the side of the
House opposite-to that on which sat Mrs. George
Turner, the Premier’s wife. Mrs. Premier is not
exactly in favor with the “lydies” of Melbourne—
having much of her husband’s undiplomatic
brnsqueness of speech, and few of the monkey-
tricks of the pseudo-refined imitators of Cockney
manners and customs. This ostentatious piece of
cutting was an act of gross ill-manners of which
only “ lydies ” could be guilty.
# * *
Very few donned “dickies” for Acting.
Gov. Madden’s levee, ordinary dress being thought
good enough for a gubernational understudy.
And it was amusing to see the solemn way in
which His Ex. received his brothers, each trying
to look unconscious of the farce. But the crown-
ing irony of the performance was when “Rev.
Nathaniel Kinsman ” was announced, and whole-
sale marriage-contractor stood face to face with
wholesale divorce-contractor.

As to the cable that “ Australians in
London ” condemn the tone of Premier Reid’s
message, it is only necessary to remark that as
the Australians permanently in London are nearly
all greasers in search of titles, they are dreadfully
shocked at any official message which does nob
savor of the most crawlsome grovel.

One of the surprises in the list of boom-
defaulting prisoners just released from N.S.W.
gaols, was the name of Andrew Fitzgerald. By
most people it was thought that he, at any rate,
would have to serve his full five years. He was
managing-director of the hideously-mismanaged
and now defunct Trades and Labor Co-operative
Store, and within a few months of the formation
of the society, he managed to “snavel,” say,
£2ooo—all made up of the hard-earned shillings of
workmen.
And it seems passing strange that Francis
Abigail should have been released while M'Namara,
tried and sentenced along with him, is still im-
mured. In sentencing M'Namara, Judge Win-
deyer called him Abigail’s “ evil genius,” but, at
the same time, he just as severely castigated
Abigail. Evidently M'Namara’s friends are not
of the right sort. M'Namara is a rascal and knew
better than Abigail how many beans made five ;
but he is suffering from cancer, and deserves any
pity which may fairly be accorded to a prisoner
on account of physical infirmity.
W, P. Smairl, released after serving half his
time for embezzlement, was manager of the
Imperial Building Society. He played up the
shareholders’ money in yachting and cutting a
dash generally; still, he was a convenient scape-
goat for a number of far more influential per-
sonages, some of whom have reason to thank their
stars for a variety of things.
At one Sydney banking prosecution, the writer
sat in court near an old man, a blacksmith.
Against the advice of the wife, who for half-a-cen-
turyhad toiled and saved with him, he had invested
the whole of his life-earnings, nearly ,£2OOO, in a
r Aten, politician-bossed savings-trap. Of course
he lost every cent. His wife died broken-hearted,
and the old man, who bad only ceased work when
past 70, had to go and live in the poorhouse. No
one possessed of any humanity can fail to grieve
at the sufferings of the faithful wives who, with-
out share in their husbands’ misdeeds, have
sorrowed at their disgrace and worked hard for
their liberation ; hut such cases as that of the old
blacksmith —only one out of a thousand victims —
have cried aloud for vengeance and have hardened
the public’s heart.

The theory lately ventilated in The Bul-
letin that Mrs. Dean was possibly never poisoned
at all is being worked out before the Commission,
Judging from the weighty medical evidence
already given in support of this view, it is plain
that the Crown will find the gravest difficulty in
fully demonstrating that Mrs. Dean’s system ever
held a single grain of arsenic. As to discovering
where the poison was bought—well, you can buy
arsenic and morphia tabloids from any chemist in
Australasia without signing the poison-book.

One very important aspect of the Dean
poisoning case would he much better understood
by the public had the wood-merchant, who stated
before the Commission that Mrs. Seymour threw
water over him, been encouraged or allowed to
tell his story in full.

No less than three Consuls ( vide Age)
sufficed to support the dignity of the black Re-
public, Liberia, at the Melb. Birthday levee.
Even Servia was represented by a Consul. Scores
of foreign gentry emerged from obscurity with
multi-colored button-bole ribbons representing,
in some way or other, various insignificant petty
States of which nobody had ever heard. It is not
four years since that a “Colonel” (aged 23) bad
the right of entry to certain Government ’Ouse
official feeds on the strength of his appointment
as Consul for a country whose Consulateship in
another province was publicly on sale for <£s. It’s
a good job that a Consul has to wear a uniform at
official feeds the cost of hiring a second-hand
one effectually bars a Governor being eaten out of
bouse and home by every Tom, Dick and Harry
who can get some sort of Consulship for the price
of a long beer.
To call the proposed new Sydney Sunday
penny paper the Sunday Morning Herald will
be a clumsy infringement of the S.M. Herald pro-
prietary’s rights. Morning Herald is the name
of Sydney’s oldest daily ; to call the new paper
Sunday Morning Herald will be to clearly imply
connection with the daily. There are thousands
of good names for newspapers which have never
been used, or even thought of, and such a lack of
originality argues badly for the success of the new
venture.

The other night, one of several johnnies

People have wondered why more has not

consequently, as there was intestacy, there is no

The proposal by the late N.S.W. Swimmers’
Conference to establish a swimmers’ “Legion of
Heroism ” is simply a disgusting instance of
medal-hunger—prompted by the same sort of
motive which induces a Malicolo boy to wear a
fish-bone in his ear. No decoration is worth a
rap which does not come from a disinterested tri-
bunal. The proposed league of heroes would be
a vulgar and unblushing mutual-admiration
society.
The Frock-coated Democracy is coming !
At the Melb. Davitt reception the majority of the
Labor M.sP were trussed up in the sinister gar-
ment named. Hancock and Prendergast were
specially conspicuous. There is already a sort of
Sunday-school superintendent aspect about the
working-man representative, which his outbreak
of frock-coats on special occasions accentuates.
Davitt, in his plain brown suit of tweed,
was a striking contrast to the highly respectable
local Balbuses. By the way, if Prendergast
and co. were acquainted with a certain theory
associated with frock-coats, they would have their
own proud possessions in that line converted into
home-made pants forthwith.

The notable Bradford-Powell will-case
(N.S.W.) has to lie re-argued, Mr. Justice Foster,
who originally heard the case, having retired from
the bench on pension on the ground of ill-health
before delivering bis judgment. The case is
clearly one in which the costs of the first trial
should be paid out of the Public Treasury. No
citizen should have to pay for justice twice over.

Dear Bulletin, —Should that breeched
abstraction, chivalry, hold good when a scraggy
she-male in baggy knickers astride the ■ ncertain
bike violently collides with your person 1 One
old gentleman in Melb. evidently thinks so. On
a recent Sunday I saw a bevy of cyclists careering
up Oollins-street, among them several “ rational-
ised ” women. On turning a corner one partiou
larly attenuated she took a short cut across the
pavement, where her machine fell, bringing down
with it and herself a portly old gentleman who,
thinking his assailant a mere reckless male, was
preparing to utter terrible curses, when he noticed
from the loosened strands of feminine hair that
he had been laid out by the New Woman. Where-
upon he arose meekly, doffed his hat deferentially,
expressed profound apologies, picked up the scat-
tered fragments of the cycling woman, and cour-
teously helped her to re-mount. I never saw
chivalry so grossly misplaced.—R.C.B.
Men and women riding on tandem bicycles
—tlie woman in front, the man behind, as if to
typify the altered relations of the sexes—are
beginning to be not uncommon sights in the Melb.
streets. They are profane spectacles to anybody
with a grain of romance left in his composition.
Woman ceases to be an angel, even by courtesy,
when she bestrides a bike.

he went out like the snuff of a candle.

A lawyer doing fair business was
divorced from his wife some time ago, £i a week
/limony being granted against him. Both lie and
his former half again dipped into the matrimonial
lucky-bag, the latter securing a rich husband. As
the £4 was a mere fleabite compared to hubby
No. 2’s income, hubby No. 1 thought he might
discontinue the alimony, and petitioned the court
to that effect. But he was unsuccessful ; and now
Jhe lady always insists on getting her four pounds
of flesh, so that the legal limb is working his
tongue out of joint merely to exist himself and
provide this revengeful one every four weeks with
,£l6, which she usually carefully places in the
poor-box or gives away to a Chinese mission.

A Melb. dame lately appealed to “ Tatter-
sail ” Adams to supply her on credit with 50
tickets in the V.D.L. Bank lottery and 50 in a
Melbourne Cup sweep. “One of these tickets will
Certainly win a prize,’’ she wrote, “and then you
can deduct the cost of the tickets from the prize.
Please to be so good as to oblige in this instance.
It will benefit all round. God will bless you for it
and give you every success in your new under-
taking.” But even her further assurance that she
had been for many years a member of the Wes-
leyan Church didn’t help the transaction through.

Few know that most of the Melb. churches

In Chinese laundries it is customary for
the Chow, when wetting starched clothes, before
ironing, to spray the water on them with his
mouth (as he also sprays wedding-cake when icing
it) instead of sprinkling with the hand. A
person wearing underclothing that goes through
this process should certainly feel far from comfort-
able. If the laundryman happens to be con-
tagiously diseased there is probably no surer
method of passing-on the trouble.

The recent reappearance of Mrs. G. B. W.
Lewis as Hamlet, at Melb. Bijou, surprised a lot
of people who hadn’t previously seen the old-time
favorite since her return from Hingland. Mrs.
Lewis has disposed of much solid flesh of late
and although the figure of her Hamlet
doesn’t suggest nervous disease, it compares
favorably with the outlines of several male
tragedians in the same capacity. Absurdly high-
heeled shoes and a superfluity of false hair on her
head and face were the chief objections to this
lady Hamlet. She spoke her words excellently,

but for some reason or other her memory
proved “fluffy.” “One never forgets Shakes-
peare,” as veteran Alfred Dampier used to say.
Yet Mrs. Lewis, who ought to know her Prince
of Denmark by heart, was often “stuck” for a
word the other night. Her shoes were to blame,
probably. They must have been giving the
estimable artist a bad time.
A small one-horse S.A. butter-factory
lately presented a case of butter to G.O.M.
Gladstone, who forwarded it on to the poor of
Hawarden. So far, neither Mister Gladstone nor
the poor have been beard from, and opinions in
S.A. as to the strength ot that cow-juice are
becoming pronounced.

Daring hospital self-denial week in Melb.
a tarpaulin was spread out inside St. Paul’s
Cathedral fence, and people invited to toss their
contributions over. It was a sight to see the un-
employed gazing wistfully at the florins and
shillings.
Harry Monkhouse (whom the
writer remembers as a slim young man
in pantomime at the Grecian Theatre,
when Oscar Barrett conducted the
orchestra, and clever artists were cheap
in that neighbourhood) is the one dis-
tinct humorist of the George Edwardes
Co. He creates characters after his
own large image. If his deliberate,
easy-going method be a seedling from
that of Paul Bedford, or Odell of old,
it is none the less original and up to
modern requirements. Monkhonse’a
impersonation of the melancholy mum-
mer, changed for a time to a clockwork
figure in “The Mountebanks” —a part
identified with little George Lauri at
this end of the world—was a particular
success “over yonder.” As for his
long Mariner bold (Snazelle’a character,
here) in “Paul Jones,” it was one of
the sights of London which photo-
graphed themselves on the cockney
heart. Harry Monkhouse is essentially
an English comedian—there can be on
doubt about that—and his name fits
him like a glove. We have had a sad
experience of at least one comedian
who brought a very Hinglish reputa-
tion with him, therefore it seems neces-
sary to mention that Mr. Monkhouse
conjures upjiorecollections of the old-
fashioned joker in question. .His per-
formance in “A Gaiety Girl -—the
only bit of Monkhouse that Melp. has
sampled at tirns of writing—excited a
general craving for more.

Melbournian: “My new parson
lias a buggy and pair, which, these
times, simply slays him,”
From the Judge's remarks in sentencing
Oscar Wilde, it may be surmised that accused was
charged under what is known as Labouchere’s Act
passed a few years ago to meet decisions which
quashed convictions in this class of offences where
both were consenting parties. The maximum
penalty under the other law is 15 years. It is a
curious reflection on English jurisprudence that
while Italy and Austria were studiously omitting
all reference to these offences “by consent,” and
so practically squelching the most odious of all
classes of blackmailers, the Britishers were enact-
ing such a law, thus practically inviting the
11 unemployed ” “over there.”

“The only child of Major and Mrs.
Blank” is how a Brisbane paper puts it. You
cannot be too careful.
Parson Hunter, of Fitzroy (Melb.),
devotes himself largely to the reclama-
tion of the bad youths of his parish, and
does it with little success, but with a
hopeful heart. His pupils frequently fall
from grace, and when they are run in
they mostly call on him for testimony as
to character. Then the kindly old
preacher gets into the box and swears
that he always had great hopes of the
wild-haired larrikin in the dock, and
regards him as having been “ led astray,”
after which the Bench generally gives
the offender three months. The Bench
used to be touched by the pastor’s re-
marks, and let down the offender lightly,
but it found that nearly every rowdy
youth in the district has “ had ” the good
man at some time or other, so now when
he gets into the box and testifies, it
generally gives the offender one month
for his misdeeds and two months extra
for taking down the benevolent old
preacher,

The Bishop of Salisbury reports
to a gathering of English clerics that the
commercialism displayed by the Aus-
tralian clergy is something awful, and
that the churches down-under “ compete
with each other like hotels.” Yet the
British parson’s commercialism enables
him to grab all the fat Australian
“shops,” and Australian parsons are too
humble to compete with the imported
brother for a well-paid Bishopric. The
unctuous critic proposes to cure the
ungodly state of things he describes by
setting up Church Establishment in Aus-
tralia. Wise and gracious prelate! A
big, bloated monopoly would certainly
cure competition. The Bulletin meekly
wonders if the establishment of the
Anabaptists or the Plymouth Brethren
would suit holy John O’ Salisbury ?
While R.O. Archbishop Carr, Anglican
Bishop Thornton, Presbyterian Pope Rentoul, and
other big guns of the different churches were
thundering defiance at each other over the ques-
tion of the unity of the churches, the Rev. Mr.
Williams, of the Church of England, and the Rev.
W. Trebelcock, of the Wesleyan Connection,
were taking part in the presentation to Rev.
Patrick O’Reilly, R.C. priest at Bacchus Marsh,
Vic., of a purse of sovereigns and an illuminated
address. An eminent military authority once
remarked that the hope of the British army lay in
its non-commissioned officers. Similarly, the hope
of the churches may lie with the inferior clergy.

they left the much-abused “Johnnie” absolutely
nowhere. About each counter and stall through-
out the afternoon was a dense circle of women,

expressions varying from a soulful gloat to a
scornful sneer. But the eternal female didn’t buy

A rosebud on ray table lies,
A thing divine :

Than mine, than mine.
Its petals shed a fragrance rare
For me alone,
A perfume which no morning air
Hath ever known.
Yon rosebud bringeth heaven near
To me, to me.

The human body is a victim to those
dreadful enemies, the microbes, and to prevent
those treacherous foes to approach you there is no
better method than to keep yourself clean and not
allow food to decay in your mouth or the clogging
of the epidermis. To prevent these things, one of
the most leading chemists in Sweden brought out
his world-renowned Amykos, which, without
doubt, is the best toilet requisite with which to
gargle your throat, wash your mouth and face.
Amykos is strongly recommended as a preventa-
tive of sore throat and bad breath.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
June 4, 1895.
My DbarMoorabinda—
Sydney University Dramatic Society broke out
brightly at Sydney Royal Standard, one evening
last week, in “The Critic,” by Sheridan, preceded
by “Cousin Zachary.” The first piece was quite
d Vamateur, the performers seeming to be all
elbows and feet—but if it was put on for the pur-
pose of lengthening the entertainment, then
“ Zachary ” was a huge success, for it made the
first part seem 14 hours long. It was permeated,
by the way, by a real, live actress, who proved
her title clear to the regular stage by the rush of
rouge to her cheeks and her sang froid whenever
a wild stage-cuddle loomed in the “ business.”
The “ Suds ” always stage some dramatic
antique (nothing of the “Withered Leaves”
calibre for them!) and Sheridan’s “ Critic ” was no
exception to this golden rule. The first act was
the more polished, and in it Mr. Gregan M‘Mahon,
as Sir Fretful Plagiary, beautifully dressed in
lavender satin, embroidered vest, and clouded
cane gave another clever character sketch—a line
of business in which this gifted amateur would
shine in any company with a little more general
stage experience. Mr. J. P. Jones, as Sneer, appears
to be quarrelling with his part, but he has a good
stage-profile and a pair of legs to go upon. Mr.
H. De Lissa fitted the part of Dangle like a new
glove; Miss Wilton (professional) was a good
Mrs. Dangle, with Mr. Pickburn, as Puff, a
flattering critic, such as theatrical managers love.
He spoke too fast for his points to tell, otherwise
his diatribes would have been quite as applicable
to the modern “society” journalist as to Sheri-
dan’s creation. I think it was rather a mistake,
though, for Puff, who was dressed in black tights
and a black coat, to have the tails of that coat
lined with white! From some points of view, it
rather suggested the good old nursery-rhyme of
“ Giddy Giddy Gout.”
The hilarious burlesque-rehearsal of the second
act was more of a romp than a “reading,” but
still the audience roared with laughter, as it
was meant to. It is no unusual thing to see
people convulsed with merriment at amateur-
shows—the worst of it is, that it generally happens
when the’tears are playing “ Hamlet.” In the
funny part, Mr. Pickburn was too aggressively on
deck to be pleasing, but Mr. Le Gay Brereton,
Mr. Y. Creagh, Mr. MacMahon, and Miss Roseby
—a very graceful member of society, who wore
diaphonous draperies, and a hat like a big white
petunia blossom—all did excellently for the home
team. Tilburina was played by a plump and
humorous professional damsel, in white, who re-
frained from claiming the whole of the stage, as I
have seen pros, do under similar circumstances.
After the play (which was fairly well-mounted
and excellently dressed) part of the audience went
on to the stage to felicitate the performers to the
clink of glasses, for the “Suds” are nothing if
not hospitable. By the way, the veteran Charles
Burford still coaches the ’Varsity mummers.
A novelty last week was the appearance at Syd-
ney School of Arts of a blind concert co. which
gave a press and medical invitation matinee.
These blind musicians are from the Ormond
College of Music (Melb.), and are going under the
charge of Mr. and Mrs. Webb on what I predict
will prove a successful tour round the world.
Mrs. Webb’s brother is one of the performers,
so it’s quite a family party. The co. pre-
sents a pleasing ensemble on the stage, the girls
(more cheerful under their affliction than the
youths—women are so adaptable!) in matric.
gowns and mortar-boards, and the youths in
evening dress with boutonnihres. If the
manager had not to move them about the stage like
chessmen they would look just like ordinary folk,
and listening to the clever performance would
never suggest to you that the performers can-
not see. The repertoire of the co. is excellently
chosen, and Mr. Grey, who has a clear and ring-
ing tenor voice, Miss Wotton (soprano), Miss
Drummond, a merry-faced girl with a clear, arch
soprano, and Mr. Bartlett (a born comique)
appear to be the stars (if there are any stars in
such a good all-round co.). The way they played
the violin, piano, flute and clarionette was a re-
proach to many gimlet-sighted ignoramuses who
can’t play two bars of anything.
Blindness runs in all shapes. For instance, a
well-known Sydney man, verging on the unmen-
tionable age of 60, must have been very short in
his worldly sight to be so taken in by a larky
matron as the newest story says he was. It was
the old yarn with a brand new denouement. He
approached her on the ferry-boat—Mrs. Guelph,
from Blank? He was sure he knew her. The
dame, who knew perfectly well who he was and
what she was doing, assented readily and chummed
in. “ Have you lunched ?” said he as they went up
town. “No.” “ Then may I have the honor of
dining with you ? ” He wasn’t blocked there,
either, for the quarry assented once more and
named a fashionable hostelry, whither they repaired.
Like the Duchess of Plaza Toro, the lady had
“ wine with her dinner,” and afterwards Lothario
(who is “by no means a beginner” at flirtations)
tenderly enquired if she would like a drive or a
nice walk I “Oh, thank you, I must go to the
jeweller s,” replied the little lamb —“ but you may
come if you like.”
At the jeweller’s the hoary Romeo suggested
that she would like a nice little present from him.
The lamb assented nimbly, and chose a handsome
bangle eleven guineas—which the wolf paid for
without a murmur. Outside, a drive to Dash, a
frisky watering-place, was suggested, but the
syren had other purchases to make, and, the wine
working vyonders, Don Juan persisted in present-
ing her with other articles of value. Then came
the denouement in the Strand! “Now shall we
go and have tea at Dish?” “I am so sorry to
refuse your very kind offer, but, really, I have to
meet my husband at 5.30,” she said, frigidly, “so,
good afternoon,” and away she sailed, bangles and
all. The story should have gone on to relate how
at that moment the wicked one’s own wife turned
up, and the curtain fell on a baffled Bluebeard with
empty pockets going sadly and respectably home
to tea. The moral (if there is a moral to such a
business) seems to be “Never pay in advance.”
Give me back all those presents I promised
vou, t ’ said Danby, in “Cinder Ellen”—a speech
no “man of the world” (meaning thereby the
flesh and the devil) was ever known to smile at.
The conversazione to the new Chancellor of
Sydney University—J udge W mdeyer—eventuated
in the Great Icechest (I mean hall) of the afore-
said hotbed of learning the other Wednesday, and
was a polite success. The only jumble-up was
over the inner reception committee or absence of
it, and people zig-zagged in the stone doorway
and made passes to shake hands with inoffensive
citizens sitting near by in the draught, who glared
ferociously, upon which the entrants plunged
blindly into the bosom of the assemblage in an
absolutely unwelcomed state. Evidently, the
cream of the milking was hanging round the front
door waiting to receive the guest and his party,
for I noticed a great rush of robes in Judge Win-
deyer’s wake when he came in to slow organ music
at 8.30.
The Chancellor rather set my teeth on edge, for
he wore a strictly correct (from a ’Varsity point
of view) but brick-dusty mingling of terra-cotta
and vermilion on his robe. Lady Windeyer wore
amber satin draped with cream lace, and carried
a posy of pink roses—altogether, the Chancelloress
looked more sartorialiy up-to-date than we are
accustomed to see her. The dressing didn’t seem
to be phenomenally lovely (though I liked a
dainty white trimmed with the very finest black
lace in a manner suggestive of fern-iike splash-
work or pen-and-ink drawing). For one thing,
the ’Varsity men’s robes kept one’s nerves on the
jar so. One professor of science was parrokeetish
in red and Erin-go-bragh gown ; another bag of
learning on two long legs suggested Portia or
Card. Moran in his scarlet gown ; another pro-
fessorial person did violence to chromatics
in a gown picked out with red and purple,
and, as the colors were fighting behind his back,
they didn’t make his eye ache as it deserved.
I think the very ugliest robe was a black one with
a long, diamond-shaped patch of scarlet edged
with rabbit-fur. The effect was that of a rabbitter
with one gory skin thrown over his shoulder.
Of the gowned ladies a petite B. A., without her
mortar-board, looked magazine-picturish, but a
welter-weight matrieulator was unwise to sport a
small, round red fan, considering how very wide her
face was—it suggested a mole on the moon. A
tall girl-graduate had a bunch of pink roses stuck
under her mortar-board, with incongruous effect.
I can’t say I like the cap worn indoors of an even-
ing—it makes you think of fancy-dress; and
when a girl wears flowers under the classic head-
gear it looks as if she were poking fun at it. Dr.
Women-Only Zenana Ryder (a bit of a spookist,
I’m told) turned up and didn’t seem to have much
to say for herself—l suppose because there were
men present.
A neat musical programme was provided,
arranged by Mr. Barff. A new lady vocalist sang
as one would expect a highly-trained tom-tit to
warble, but Miss Colborne-Baber (she goeth ’Ome
next year), in pink, sang, “I arise from dreams
of thee ” most charmingly, and later on she and
“Daddy ” Hallewell gave a pleasant rendering of
the duo, “La ci darem.” Daddy, going alone,
made a great hit with “She alone charmeth
my sadness;” and Mr. Harrison White ac-
companied the singers, besides contributing
organ soli. After that, Professor David gave
some “ pre-historic peeps” in one of the
outer schools; with lantern slides showing the
great megatherium, likewise the leviathan, com-
bined with a few sidelights on the moa. After
which there was a great rush for light refresh-
ment, and more conversazione, every woman
making the same remark about how thoughtful it
was to put rugs on the cold marble floor. And I
expect most of the men thought so, too, even if
they didn’t say so, for cold feet aren’t a feminine
monopoly, I presume.
Talking about the University reminds me that
an erudite lady connected with the seat of learning
aforesaid tells another good story which will stand
repeating. A medical - studentess —a tall and
strapping Swedish girl—was walking home down
a London street at midnight’s solemn hour, when
the inevitable man approached and requested to
be allowed to walk with her. The studentess was
equal to the opportunity. Taking a cool glance
round, she said, airily, and in her most gentle-
manly manner : “ Oh, certainly if you’re
frightened!”
I hear, by the way, that in Sydney Medical
School two, at least, of the lecturers, when they
arrive at the more confidential portions of their
discourse, turn the girls out and enlighten the
youths alone, and then they turn the youths out
and let the girls into the wrinkle. But don’t you
think this is mere squeamishness on the part of
the professors aforesaid ? For if a girl can absorb
medical wisdom from the lips of a strange man
(and medical professors are generally very far re-
moved from the male old-woman type) then I fail
to see why she cannot hear it in men’s company.
There is safety in numbers, also.
Apropos of medical schools —a quiet-looking
girl got married, the other day, and most of the
medicos in and around a certain Australian city
sent her a cheque because she was the best
“subject” in the city hospital for some time
owing to her supposed incurable hip-disease.
All the doctors gave her up—but they
didn’t waste her—they utilised her as a living
object-lesson, and paid her handsomely too, and,
in her turn, she earned her fees. When a lecture
was on or an argument got up. Hip-disease was
unclothed and weights put on her feet, and then she
was strung-up, like mutton on a hook. Dr. Saw-
bones and his troupe of green students would come
along—lecture and argue, and turn her round and
round—talk more scientific jargon, and go their
way. Then the wardsman would take her down,
revive her, and string her up again in time for the
next medical demonstrator and his grisly crew.
The odd part of it was that, through all these
ordeals, she was bright and happy.
“Mam’zelle Nitouche” had a bright and glorious
resurrection at Sydney Lyceum last Saturday,
though there were one or two little rifts here and
there. For instance, Nellie Stewart (who makes
a touch-and-go Nitouche—it suits Nellie to have
lots to do) had a new lilt in place of the tuneful
Nautch song, though there was nothing to justify
the alteration. I couldn’t hear what the new
warble was about, but it went to a clashing of
things like tin-pot covers and ought certainly to
be called the Saucepan Lid song. The only re-
deeming thing about it was that Nellie wore the
old familiar flesh-colored jersey with a rainbow
skirt, a blue zouave and barbaric ornaments. The
tricky jersey, by the way, was the only garment
which showed signs of wear and tear, for it
wrinkled round the waist more than usual, and
thereby lost some of its—force. Flo. Young was
the one who wore a new dress—a fresh-butter-
colored brocade sprigged in pale-pink, with
shoulder-flaps of venetian-green —the polonaise
opening over a pale-pink petticoat, draped in
white lace. A black velvet hat on one ear,
powdered hair, dimples and diamonds, completed
the handsomest get-up in a radiant show which
only weakened when novelties were billed instead
of old numbers.
For instance, the new version of the green-room
wasn’t half so exciting as the old pas when the
ballerinas tumbled like a house of cards in the
position (I mean the girls were) of a wide-open
pair of scissors. Beside the startling pose even
the highest kicker of them all fell flat and unpro-
fitable. Wallace Brownlow, as Vicomte, has a
part that suits his military-man-in-mufti style
down to the little tin spurs. Both Ids songs (he
wisely stuck to the old ones) were artistically ren-
dered and loudly encored. That is the penalty they
pay on the stage for doing good work. They encored
Nellie S., who is beginning to look pale and tired
(now don’t laugh—l know actresses’ complexions
are never according to nature, but all the same
any intelligent person can discover a pale woman
even under four inches of grease-paint !) for the
energetic “Drum Song” in the last act, and in
vain she shook her golden head at them.
I think Lauri must keep all his parts in pigeon-
holes to be taken when wanted, for his Celestin
is the very same Celestin as of yore —only that
when he got on the stump and brandished a Home
Rule green umbrella it looked for a moment as if
Mr. Michael Davitt had come to town. By the
way, the frisky barrack-scene (I believe this part had
to be very prudently translated to suit English sus-
ceptibilities) rather pricked open the recent Sydney
military scandal (the authorities, cn parenthe.se,
are getting out of the fix they ought never to
have been in by granting the hero prolonged leave
of absence). “Is there a lady in the barracks?”
enquires the Commandant; and 1 fully expected
a still small voice from the gods to reply—“ Ask
General Hutton.”
There was a crowded house, including a gentle-
man who had just had his nose put out of joint,
and who appears to be plunging wildly into the
society maelstrom to drive dull care away. I
think it is a great sign of despair in a mar-
ried man when his dress-suit never has a night
off. By the way, I saw a new dress-weskit
at the opera—cream and satin with small black
buttons ; but ’tis not enough. No johnny is a
real johnny, don’t you know, in anything less
than silk stockings, knee-breeches and buckled
shoes—though heaven knows how New Women
dread the terrible disillusion which must come
when men unveil their lead-pencil understandings,
for, judging by the bicycle youth, the art of calf-
padding is still in its infancy.
Regarding Premier Reid’s pert message, if the
English big-wigs really want to punish G.H.R.
for his little boutade they should take him at his
word and let him discover a home-made Gov.; and
then Potts Point would rend him limb from limb
in baffled rage at losing the chance to be a sister
to a real live peeress. Many unauthorised rumors
are in the air re the vacant Governorship, but
there is nothing definite as to who will fill dead
men’s shoes. Perhaps the aristocracy are super-
stitious, and dread a ghost on the battlements or
a spectre behind the arras ? The most likely-
looking of the unauthorised appointments is cer-
tainly Mr. Munro-Ferguson_, Liberal M.P. for
Leith Burghs, whose portrait lately appeared in
The Bulletin as probable Governor of S. A. Mr.
Munro-Ferguson (they will knight him before
starting, of course), I remember, was something
like Gov. Hopetoun facially a young-looking
man, clean-shaven or hairless, as the case may be,
simply and primitively attired in a pair of bare
legs and a kilt.
To-night (Thursday) the Fresh Air League ball
takes place in Sydney Town Hall in the presence
of the acting-Governor and party, Major-General
and Mrs. Hutton, etc. A large number of tickets
(10s. 6d. each) have been disposed of, and the ball
promises to be a distinctly gay affair.
A recently-printed report that two young Syd-
ney ladies, sisters, well-known in musical circles,
had, in conjunction with a Melb. lady, started a
dress-designing establishment in Regent-street,
London, is, I am assured, altogether incorrect and
without foundation, the ladies in question having
gone to Europe strictly “ on pleasure bent.”
The Theatrical Carnival at the Exhibition
proved (writes my Melb. correspondent) that
Gaiety loveliness is not a mere arrangement of
grease-paint and foot-lights, but one that will
stand the garish light of day without dire results.
On the whole, the G.G.s looked as well in mufti
as in full war-paint. One statuesque beauty,
however, somewhat marred her appearance by
painting her under-lip a fa Japanese geisha, and
making herself look as if she had been eating
damson-jam. However, she made up for this
somewhat brilliant coloring by toning the shadows
round her eyes most sombrely.
The classic-looking Maude Hobson and the
petite Ethel Selwyn served at the same buffet—a
happier contrast than the pair made would be
hard to hit on. Maude was entirely clad in black
satin, except her apron, which was white nain-
sook, accord eon-pleated, with a velvet Empire hat
ornamented in front with a diamond clasp. Ethel
was all in fluffy, filtny-looking white muslin with
many frills and rosettes of white bdb6 ribbon, and
a soft-looking befeathered hat,
Decima Moore, whose gown and hat showed
several different tints of violet, very harmoniously
blended, hoisted her sleeves slightly and served
out tea most energetically. She didn’t even throw
in the smile, which one fairly expected on such
an occasion, but abruptly asked, “Will you take
tea?” then, holding up the sugar-basin, interro-
gated, “With or without?’’ gave change honestly
to the uttermost farthing, and turned to the
next comer. Grace Palotta, however, smiled and
showed her charming dimple in such a way that
one did not observe till long after that in the
matter of change she had not been quite so exact
as Miss Moore. Grace looked more Parisian than
ever in a chic dress of tahac brown (her favorite
color for street-wear, by the way) with yoke and
vast sleeves of checked glace silk. Her hat, an
airy nothing of wired lace, was an excuse for some
pink velvet orchids which nestled in the twists of
her hair and showed up its brightness.
Laura Kearney, in pink surah blouse, black skirt
and black picture-hat begarlanded with roses, was,
with Blanche Massey, running a race-game in a
picturesque little tent of their own. Laura, who
got really enthusiastic and excited, and advised
her patrons to “buck up” and to “plank their
poin,” was quite a foil to the placid and demure-
looking Blanche, who, aesthetically swathed in
black with plumed picture-hat, stood round
languidly and endeavored to charm the nimble
shilling with sweet smiles and little chirping
birdlike requests.
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.

Melbourne Herald was the only news-
paper which “interviewed ” Davitt on his arrival
in that city.
Every visitor to Sydney who wants to live
among all the comforts of a palace and to associat
with the salt of the earth, should put up at the
Hotel Metrocele. The Metropole is one of the
finest hotels south of the line, commands splendid
views, and while situated in a peaceful and re-
tired locality, is within easy reach of every place
that a sane visitor would want to go to.
Whoever desires a warm swimming-bath
in cold weather is cordially recommended to patron-
ise Sydney Natatorium, where the hot sea-water
bath is always filled with the clearest and purest
of water, and all other kinds of baths are con-
stantly in good working order. The sea-water
baths in the open involve the disadvantages of
cold, sewage, cuttle-fish, sharks, mud and other
drawbacks, and the Natatorium swimming bath,
being free from all these, is a striking proof of the
ad vantages of art over nature. The Natatorium
Hotel, attached to the baths, is at present to-let.
When J. G. Pangborn, boss of the World’s
Transportation Commission, now in Australia
“seeking evidence,” was entertained by those
dull, dreadful mediocrities, the Melb. Exhibition
trustees, the other day, the usual intolerable
tommyrot was talked through the reek of drink
about the federation of the English-speaking
peoples. Then the Murkan got up and remarked
significantly, as a tip to Australians, that the
secret of thfe success of the United States had been
that Americans “ had always spelt nation with a
big N. ” £ £ Smith and his brother Imperialists
coughed hard and proceeded to discuss the whisky.
Victoria has established a Committee of
Public Accounts, to be elected by the Assembly,
irrespective of parties, and whose business it will
be to keep a perpetual oversight of the Treasury,
and to know everything that is done or doing, or
proposed to be done, with the public money. Con-
sidering how little the average Assembly knows
about the public cash—as evidenced by the case of
B. R. Wise, of N.S. W., who asked about a dis-
crepancy of ,£200,000, and merely evoked the
information that he was a snake and an eel-and
that it seldom knows even that much until it is
too late, this is a reform of great value. Moreover,
the system of non-party committees always helps
towards the extinction of Government by Contra-
diction.
Cable news that “the authorities” have
suddenly determined to suppress horrible practices
at the West End of London must not be taken too
seriously. Hitherto the police have been pulled
back by those same authorities every time they
started to prove a case. If the police were now
empowered to do their worst Mrs. Grundy would
get some awful literature on her breakfast-table
presently. Detectives are never ordered to wade
into any morass where they would be likely to
discover a few noble reprobates. Wilde, after all,
was only the brilliant son of an Irish physician—
a mere commoner, hang it! When it pleased a
shabby marquis to crush the parvenu libertine
the authorities were quite agreeable. But a Lord
Oscar would have been spared the indignity of a
dungeon-cell, anyway.
London Weekly Sun of March 17 prints
an account by “A. J. Dawson ” of a N.S.W.
country editor whose sanctum was invaded by a
maudlin poet, describing himself as “Phil. Laun-
ceston, the man who lived with Adam Lindsay
Gordon, and ought to have died with him.” This
visiter started to turn out copy, “and what he
had written was not mere versifying; it was living
music” which made the editor weep. “A. .7.
Dawson” claims to have many of “Phil. Laun-
ceston’s ” verses, and in a further article on April
17 he is so ill-advised as to print some of them
which, so far from being “living music,” are
arrant trash of the kind that floods this paper’s
waste-basket. _ “A. J. Dawson,” whoever he is,
and “Phil. Launceston, the strangely-faithful
follower of Australia’s one great poet,” seem to
have between them diddled the Weekly Sun with
a fine sample of American fake-yarn.

The late Hon, GEORGE CHARLES
HAWKER, M.A., M.P., father of S.A.
Assembly.
Sir Henry John Irving Brodrib is first
.cousin of Thos. Brodrib, late Yic. Inspector-
General of Schools.
John M‘Elhone has taken in hand the
reformation of Woolloomooloo fish-markets. There
was always a suggestion of “Billingsgate” about
the M'Elhone.
When not in “hoffis,” Parkes’ income, it
is said, totals .£BOO a year—.£3oo as M.P., and
JSSOO as an annuity from the estate of the late
Edward Flood.
Gladstone, evidently suspicious of the
butter sent him by a S.A. admirer, gave it to the
Hawarden poor. And yet he has accepted butter
from H. Parkes !
In N.S.W. Assembly, the other night, ex-
Minister Copeland stated that Lord Jersey’s term
of office as N.S.W. Governor cost him .£20,000
besides his salary.
Gov. Buxton must be an extraordinary
man. An English paper points out that he “is
not an active brewer, but merely holds an interest.
He is, in fact, a teetotaller.”
Ex-Minister Copeland writing on Noumea :
The cathedral is the only building worth looking at—
that is, after you have boarded your hotel.
A truly excellent reservation !
The title of President Zeal, of Vic. Legis-
lative Council, carries no double glory, the little
man being a bachelor. He is fairly gilded, and
has long been unavailingly chased.
The Bulletin, taking pity on “White
Knight ” Fitz-Cibbon, has itself decided to confer
a title on him: “Rise, Sewer Edmund Fitz-
Gibbon ! Knight Commander of the Melbourne
Gutters.”
The doughty “Billy ” Crick has a brother,
a busb-storekeeper, who aspires to N.S. W. Parlia-
mentary distinction; but the gentle William is
understood to disapprove of the idea. “ Whene’er
two lions.”
J. S. O’Halloran, secretary of the Royal
Colonial Institute, is a native of Adelaide. The
C.M.G., in his case, probably denotes that
Colonials Must Grovel, He, anyhow, ought to
know.
The rumor that the wealthy and attractive
Mrs. Silas Harding is about to re-marry seems to
rest chiefly, so far, on her extensive re-decoration
of Matthew Davies’s former mansion, which she
lately bought.
R. S. Smythe is nothing if not cynical.
“Now you know Oscar Wilde, said a Southern
clergyman to him, “Do you think his is a case of
blackmail?” “No, white male,” replied the
Much-Travelled.
Mr. Way, of Adelaide, has now the dis-
tinction o! being the only untitled Chief Justice
in Australasia, and probably about the only one in
British dominions. Being a bachelor, he can
afford to wait and haggle.
The higher judiciary of N.S.W. disdains
wheels, and walks to town. The 9.30 Ocean-street
tram almost invariably passes Justices Darley,
Innes, Wffideyer, and Simpson at different points
on the journey to the city.
Hobart' City Police-court, recently. On
the bench—-the acting P.M., Bernard Shaw, Tas.
Commissioner of Police, assisted by Colonel
Warner, J.P., the lately-appointed Governor of
H.M. Gaol! Queer combination.
Ex-Chief Justice Lilley (Q.), was born
27th May, 1830, exactly 15 years after Henry
Parkes. ‘ Charleston, M.L.0., and Houngan,

on May 27. Imitation is the smeerest form of
flattery. , ' ~ s
H. H. Champion is starting a penny
weekly social democratic paper in Melbourne, and

insincere flirtation with social questions.
A Sydney building-society defaulter, lately
released from gaol, by Executive minute, entered
prison a man of 16st. weight, broad-shouldered,
erect and corpulent, and emerged, after less than
three years’ confinement, pale, washy, stooped
and list.
Bishop Webber went ’* hue to fight for
the.church in Bananaland. Laden with shekels

’Twas ever thus.
M‘llwraith, it is stated, has lost seven
stone in weight since his last visit to London two
years ago. Which looks ominous, for, broadly
speaking, a man should grow fat as he ages. On
tlie other hand, the woman who grows thin as she
grows old “ lives for ever.”
Dr. O’Hara deposed in Melb. the other
day that his regular charge for removing an adult
leg was 100 guineas, and the job took about five
minutes. “However,” he added, “sometimes
these fees are paid at the rate of a shilling in the
.£.” So that all men don’t cut up well.
A certain N.S. Wales M.P., who gets
■£3oo a year from his country and is one of the
noisest persons in the House of noise and self-
advt., went to a Sydney bookseller, the other day,
and asked for Varney Parkes’ book. “Here it
is,” said the bookseller; “one shilling, please.”
“ What ! ” cried the legislator. “ Charge !
Charge! ME!” “Yes, sir,” replied the book-
seller. “ Then I won’t have it.” And the .£30!)
a year went out.
George Charles Hawker, M. A., the
“father” of S.A. Assembly, who died May 21,
only narrowly escaped the degradation of knight-
hood after an unblemished local career of 55
years. Although one of the wealthiest men in
S.A, politics, Mr. Hawker always “voted liberal,”
and was a strong supporter of the Kingston Govt.
Only last year he earned the enmity of his brother
nlutocrats by helping to pass the progressive land-
tax which would not have got through without his
vote. He also assisted in legalising the progres-
sive succession duties; his son Ned, who is also
M.P., being on the other side on each occasion.
George Hawker was the sen of an English Admiral,
and a Cambridge graduate. He Was born in 1818,
and began his career in S.A. when but 22 years
old. He entered pastoral pursuits and acquired
some splendid properties. Bungaree, about 50
miles from Adelaide, one of the most fertile sheep-
stations in Australia, has been in Mr. Hawker’s
hands for more than half a century, but it is be-
lieved that, as a consequence of his death, it will be
cut up into small farms to the infinite benefit of the
community. Mr. Hawker was elected to the first
S.A. Assembly under Constitutional Govt., al-
though not one of its original members, his return
dating from’sB. His aggregate Parliamentary ser-
vice extended over 27 years. He was a fine.old man,
and never had an ill-word to say of anyone, and,
until the last few months, he looked as if he would
live out a century. He had been married for almost
50 years, and leaves a large family of sons and
daughters, so that his big estate, which is esti-
mated to be worth at least .£250,000, will be very
much divided. Few plutocrats have such a hold
on the workers as was possessed by the dead
veteran.
HE COULDN'T KEEP UP.
INFURIATED HORSE-OWNER : “ Why the - didn’t yer come at the

JOCKEY : “ What! Come and leave the blessed ’orse behind? ”
One Sydney boom-banker, who seems to
have appropriated at least .£lO,OOO and got safely
away, is alleged to be now in Scotland, living in
some style and under an assumed name. It would
not be too late for the police to look this gentle-
man up. His bull-face would be hard to hide.
At the opening of Vic. Parliament, the
Countess Wachtmeister, Theoso-
phist prophetess, was a notable in the
crowd, severely clad in a grey silk waterproof,
round bonnet, and a loner grey veil, looking not
unlike a clumsy German copy of Mrs. Besant.
N.S.W. Chief Justice Darley is a part-
owner of the Hill of Calvary. This is merely an
item of land-syn.licate intelligence, but there are
a few Australian Judges whose names, if similarly
collocated in such an ownership, would strike
many readers as a species of blasphemous sug-
gestion.
The fulsome Melb. reception quite knocked
up Davitt. He was swamped in the volume of
blather, and in order to escape the bores secluded
himself in a private house at Hawthorn. To keep
up his journalistic work, he has to sheer off the
idiotic idolater whose time is generally “ his own”
and valueless.
Should the “ colonial - Judge-on-Privy-
Council ” job be carried through, it will be not
altogether an evil if it provides an opportunity
for exporting Australia’s most objectionable Judge
—though Heaven forbid that such a person should
ever be shoved forward as representing this coun-
try in any way.
Evangelical brewer Buxton, the new S.A,
Governor, will be between the devil and the deep
sea when he gets to Adelaide. The sinners object
to him because he is a saint. The saints look
askance at him because he made his riches out of
beer. Money, however, covers a multitude of sins
—with both sides.
The father of Havelock Ellis (editor of
“ The Contemporary Science Series,” to which he
has contributed several valuable books) is captain
of a sailing vessel which has long been trading
between England and Australia. He was surprised
at the literary success of his son, whom he in-
tended for the sea.
The N.S.W. and Victorian hangmen were
passed in Pitt-street, Sydney, within 20 yards of
one another, on the same afternoon lately. In-
stinctively the pedestrian looked around for a
Supreme Court Judge and had his picture com-
pleted, for one of their Honors drove down the
middle of the street.
Melbourne and Sydney each possess a
medical expert qualified as a barrister. In Sydney
Dr. R. H. Todd is taking charge of the toxicolo-
gical aspects of the notorious Dean case, before
the commission of enquiry; and in Melbourne Dr.
Mullen, who is both barrister and medico, prac-
tises both professions.
A tale lately printed in a Sydney news-
paper seems founded on an alleged incident in the
career of Mr. (now Mr. Justice) Lines, of N.S.W.,
who, when a goldfields official, being about to
ride a race and having to make up weight, carried
in his belt a lot of gold-dust borrowed from the
Commissioner’s office.
Amongst the curios of Burke's “ Colonial
Gentry,” vol. 2, Henry Tennent Donaldson, in his
“statement,” says that, through his exertions
mainly has the Protect!ve policy of N.S.W. been
developed. Now, only six years ago, Mr. Donald-
son contested Yass in the interests of Freetrade,
and H. P u kes went up to “ barrack ” for him !
The most notorious and influential “bad-
pay ” ever known in Australia was lately gathered
to his fathers. As an official lawyer he was privi-
leged to the extent that nobody ever dared to sue
him, but of late years his name stank so badly
that he couldn’t get any tick worth mentioning.
He was followed to the grave Dy a great many
lawyers, but for every shark who paid the last
tribute of respect there was a shopkeeper who
spat upon the old man’s memory. His debts are
morally chargeable against the profession as a
body. If he had been an architect, or a cheese-
monger, or anything other than what he was, he
couldn’t have played the gam.- ter so many years.
A rather distin-
guished English
cleric, now touring
Australia, privately
describes how, as a
boy of ten, he accom-
panied his father on
a visit to Carlyle.
The old man and the
sage, of equally seri-
ous mind, left the
youth in the library
and for a whole after-
noon walked arm-in-
arm backward and
forward along a gar-
den-path. In an
hour or so things be-
came monotonous to
the junior visitor,
who, after overhaul-
ing several dozen
volumes in the vain
hope of discovering
illustrations, and find-
ing only copious mar-
ginal notes by the
great man, was fired
with competitive am-
bition, and, seizing a
virgin tome, pro-
ceeded to scrawl
“Cock-a-doodle-doo ”
and all the various
equivalents of “ Get-
cher ’air out,” “Pull
up yer socks,” cur-
rent at the date. Car-
lyle never discovered
the desecration.
“And,” finishes the
raconteur, “ that vol-
ume was sold for .£5O
at his death, the
purchaser firmly be-
lieving to this day
that the marks were
placed there by the
author of the French
Revolution him-
self.”
The recently - ennobbled W. A. Chief
Justice Onslow is a grandson of Alex, Macleay,
F.R.S., Speaker of the first N.S.W. Leg. Council.
Like President Baker (S.A.), he is a Cambridge
graduate. Dead George Hawker, who was also
to have been turned into an Imperialist by a touch
of the Queen’s sword, was likewise a Cambridge
M.A.
Because the Speaker of the Assembly was
given precedence in the procession at the State
funeral of the late George Hawker, in Ade-
laide, the jusfc-bebaubled Ghaffey Baker declined
to attend as President of the Leg. Council. He
worked his point, however, by getting into the
second mourning-coach as solicitor and executor to
deceased.
“Tiger ” Inglis was, at latent, about again
in London after a severe illness. He had influenza
of the worst type, accompanied by alarming de-
pression. The Tiger appears to be wonderfully
popular in London both socially and in business.
Inglis, by the way ? was one _of 4 the Londonderry
underwriters, but, with “the wisdom of the Scot,”
cleared out the moment the shares went to a fair
premium.
Mayor Snowden, Melbourne’s new knight,
has the distinction of being ttie worst public
speaker in the city of smells. On important occa-
sions, if unprepared with a few written
he frequently comes up helplessly against a dead
wall and nervelessly begs the assembled company
to excuse him. The poor man, however, alwaya
had his speech carefully written out when it came
to slobbering the Governor.
Design for a window in N.S.W. Assembly,
in memory of two “ Have Beens.”
Louis Ellis, late Yic. Sheriff, retiring on a
large pension, is about as “fit” as ever. The
Civil Service Act thus rids the country of the
services of a good man in full vigor of intellect, at
a cost of a pension almost equal to his late salary.
But the ex-sheriff is one of the exceptions which
prove the rule. The average civil servant is played
out at 60, hut Ellis is a Hebrew.
Now that J. G. Barrett, sec. of Melb.
Trades Council, is in Parliament, the Vic. Parlia-
mentary Labor party boasts the three baldest-
headed men in the House. Barrett’s skull is
an almost exact replica of those of Beazley, mem-
ber for Collingvvood, and of Sangster, the Port
Melb. representative. These, in fact, are the
only three really hairless men in the Assembly.
Frank Madden and Higgins, the Geelong member,
are not rich in hair—but the three Labor men have
heads that reflect the light like the mirror of
Venus.
Basil Thomson, Premier of the ridiculous
little limited monarchy of Tonga, is known to the
natives by a title which means “Expounder of
the Dark ways of Civilised Man.” He relates in
his book, “The Diversions of a Prime Minister,”
how one of the first things he did on taking
office was to quarrel with the Minister of Police.
Thomson dismissed a case which the police
brought before him ; and “it was a new thing in
Tonga for any man whom the police accused to be
let off.” This remark applies to other place*
besides Tonga, as Sydney stipendiaries will doubt-
less recognise.
Oscar Wilde might have preserved an
appearance of Virgilic manhood by making a
cynical defence. It was open to him to strike a
classic pose and languidly remark that he had
adopted the principles of the immortals, &c., &C.
Why didn’t he crown his dying career with an un-
paralleled oration and leave the dock amidst a burst
of fireworks, instead of lying and whining him-
self to a contemptible conclusion ? Quite recently
he dared to preach his practices in a horrible
magazine, and his early audacity as an aesthete
was presumptive evidence of moral pluck. But.
seemingly, the man was sincere in nothing—not
even in vice. The cold grip of the law reduced
Oscar to pulp.
“Can anyone tell who and what ‘Mr.
Granville Lloyd ’ is ,?” enquires The Bulletin’s
London correspondent. “He is an adventurous
young gentleman who says he comes from Austra-
lia and wishes to spend some of his spare millions
in forming a racing-stud in this country. He has
registered his colors at Weatherby’s, and induced
Mr. William Allison to enter into negotiations for
the purchase of several good horses, including
Ravensbury. He has taken grand rooms at Picca-
dilly, but at present the landlord has only seen his
secretary. Mr. Granville Lloyd, in fact, is, so far,
an absolute mystery, for not one of the Australian
division knows him. Who is Mr. Granville
Lloyd ?”

A departure from the usual cualoau \
was made by Sir John Madden in the n
method of summoning the Legislative \
Members of the Assembly to the Council «
chamber. The ordinary course, pursued \
by Lord Bopetoun, was for the Governor
to signify his desire to the President and '
for the President to announce that “ Hia
Excellency desires the attendance of the
members of the Legislative Assembly in
the Council Chamber.'’ Sir John, how-
ever,, did the commanding himself,instead
of by proxy. 4i I desire the attendance
of the members of the Legislative As-
sembly,’’ said he in tones duly magisterial;
and Sir William Zeal, utterly unable to
add to the impressiveness of that air of
authority, mildly repeated the words after
Sir John.

N.S.W. National Ass intends, with mulish

The Age is advocating a license for private
railways in Victoria. The thin end of the wedge

1 We are all Protectionists when it suits our
book. Sydney Evening News is a Freetrader —
tempered by the fact that some of its proprietary
appear to have a well-founded affection for the
welfare of the N.S.W. Protectionist sugar-interest.
Many Vic. politicians hold that Speight

said in Parliament, the other night, that he ought
to be put back as traffic-manager with a strong
political head over him. The Age omitted this
from its Parliamentary report, though the senti-
ment was cheered in all parts of the House.
The drought broke

Melbourne Harbor
Trust has spent nearly
4J millions in the last
18 years, chiefly on
dredging operations and
on building an array of
wharves which would
accommodate all the
trade of Australia, and
also very largely on
salaries, office-rent and
miscellaneous gurgeous-
ness. It is practically
bankrupt now, having
been forced, for the last
two years, to meet a
good proportion of cur-
rent expenses out of
loans. There are no
more wharves to build ;
the dredging is almost
stopped ; the expensive
staff is practically idle:
and the 17 commis-
sioners meet once a
week and yawn drearily
at each other with their
gold-stopped teeth, and
then draw their fees
and go away. Judging
by present signs, the
Trust will very shortly
j be abolished.
Lord Rosebery hopes that the Lords' Bill

Another shot to weight old gyves!
Chief Justice Madden in drawing his screw
“as sieh ” (.£3500 per an.) whilst enjoying .£5500 a
year in his capacity of Acting-Governor, creates a
precedent in Victoria. The C. J. himself was con-
tent with half the gubernatorial salary when
acting previously.
The National Ass crowd will have a hard
fight to keep their metropolitan seats at next
year’s S.A. elections. The Tory women do not
seem to be registering in any number, whereas the
Labor-party are now putting their womenkind on
the rolls by hundreds.
M‘Millan, a correspondent tells The Bul-
letin, said, on the way to England, that the
present N.S.W. Premier is the weakest who ever
held office locally. The Bulletin mentions this
to promote good feeling between the leaders of the
great N.S.W. Freetrade-party.
The generally-accepted statement that the
Vic. Civil Service will pay <£50,000 income-tax
out of a total of £156,000, has received a hard
knock by the discovery that, on this basis, the
civil servants must receive in salaries a good deal
more than the whole revenue of Victoria.
S.A. Govt, expects to have a strong work-
ing majority during the session. The Ministry
does not go in for new taxation, but the National
Ass intends to fight for an income-tax. The chief
Govt, measures will include the State Advances
and State Life Assurance Bills, abandoned last
session.
Barrett, the new member for Carlton
(Vic.) is 37, an unbending Protectionist, and sits
with the Labor-party. He began his political
education when seven years of age, he says, at the
feet of Graham Berry. The radicals sniff at this,
but it is all right if Barrett can live up to Berry’s
past. Berry himself cannot.
The only years since ’69, in which N.S. W,
exported sufficient goods to pay for its imports
and to meet the interest on its foreign liabilities,
were under the semi-protective system in ’93 and
’94. In other words, these were the only years
since the isolated ease of ’69 when the province
paid its way and was solvent. The beastly in-
fluences of Protection again.
Cross, Labour M.P. for Clermont, Q.,
vigorously denounces Fat Man, though himself
about sft. sin. high and 6ft. in girth. He explains
that his assaults are to be taken “figuratively.”
His fad is a State Bank patented by himself, and
he has been lecturing on its advantages lately. So
lukewarm, however, were audiences that Cross
had to interpolate step-danoing and similar variety
items in order to draw a house. Financiers
(theoretical) have a hard row to hoe.
THE “ SOCIETY ” HAND-SHAKE.
DENNIS: “Talk about yer thryumphal arches —share they must take
me for the new Governor.”
Alluding to Vic. Labor-party’s alliance
with the Turner Govt., Frank Madden quoted
Gray’s lines ;
“ For if a modest girl is seen
With one who cures the lover’s spleen*
We deem her not extremely nice.
And only want to know her price.”
Whereupon there were many cries of “Shame,
shame,” and other expressions of disgust from the
Labor-members. Such prudery is simply pruri-
ency.
Boodlewraith is busy bulcocking Queens-
land electoral rolls in readiness for next year’s
contest. Toowong electorate, now represented
by Mat. Reid, Labor-party secretary, is getting
particular attention. This is the electorate which
contemptuously threw out ex-Mimster Unmack

EVOLUTION.
ELDER SISTER. (who is wearing a low-necked dress for the first time) :
“ Don't stare like that at my dress, Dollie ; you'll have to

“Ten-Bob-a-Week,” on account of his alleged
statement that this sum was plenty for a working
man. He denied the soft impeachment; but the
name was his political death-blow all the same.
The N.S.W. Government has released all
the influential bank prisoners, including Abigail
and Howe, ex-Ms.L. A., after serving an average
of about two and a-half years. The release of old,
feeble, paralysed Sweetman, who isn’t influential,
and who has already served eight years for taking
a complaisant girl for a ride in his cab, doesnt
seem to be even mentioned.
Service, M.L.O. (Vic.), arguing for a
Pacific cable scheme “ under British influence,
expressed ft hope thftt Victoria. Wfts not aiming
to be “a little, peddling, dirty republic”; where-
upon the Age unkindly reminds Mr. S. that he
was a warm-hearted republican himself before he
became so intensely cautious. For his devotion to
the Throne and Person the canny grocer should
be known as Lip-Service.
A weird, ungodly species of justice, or
injustice, has lately transpired. A civil servant,
charged with an abominable offence, was acquitted
by the jury, whilst a Scotch verdict of “not
proven ” was found by the Public Service Board.
Practically the Board savs that that jury had no
business to acquit him. Either he is guilty or not
guilty. If guilty he should be dismissed ; if not
guilty he should not be punished. No board can
fairly go behind the law.
The Argus calls upon right-thinking
M’s.L. A. to protect the Leg. Council from threat-
ened democratic encroachments “The Upper
House exists not that the settled wishes of a
democracy may be thwarted, but in order that
second thoughts may have their opportunity.’
“The House o( Second Thoughts,” what rot!
The school where Patman’s creed is taught —
The cause of Number One. ’T has not,
And never had, a second thought.
Says Sydney Telegraph : “ What would
be the advantage to a combined Australia of im-
port duties on wheat, butter and a host of other
food products, of which, under no conditions,
would these colonies be importers?” It might
also be asked, what would be the good of Free-
trade in these things if there cannot possibly be
any imports? If there can’t be any imports,
neither Protection noy Freetrade would make any
difference. Then why does the Telegraph want
Freetrade so badly ?' When two parties want
separate things, and.orie party declares that they
are both the same thing, then obviously that is
the party which should give way.
Premier Reid's clumsy and much-discussed
cablegram to the N.S.W. Agent-General, telling
him to inform' the Secretary of State that the
province \vak in a hurry to get a new Governor
from ’Ouve" and was far too Important a place to
be kept-long without one, was doubtless inspired
partly by G. H. Reid’s fast-growing sense of self-
importance, partly by a desire to please the S.M.
Herald, which the other day “leadered” that
grave mischief would accrue to “loyalty” through
the protracted absence of a local Imperial figure-
head, and partly with a view to currying favor
with the local Radical party, who, he no doubt
thought, would be much impressed if he cheeked
Downing-street. From a radical point of view,
or otherwise, the Premier's cabled “ sass ” is a
dismal failure. The great mass of N.S.W. voters
awwiobdn a hurry to., get an imported Governor,
and care not one solitary curse whether they ever
see another; they can do just as well without a
Governor as they could do, and have done, without
a bishop. The proper cablegram to send would
read something like this: “ Ripon, London.
Don’t hurry appointing Governor ; getting along
very-nicely on our own hook. Anyhow, don b
trouble seudinor rich holy brewer or pawned lord.
No spare cash ; country can govern itself for next
50 years with cheap rubber-stamp. Reply at
leisure by longest mail. — Reid.”
Cabled that Lord Ripon will not appoint a
N.S.W. Governor until he is assured that the
salary is not to be touched. The only thing to
prevent the province acquiescing delightedly in
this decision is the .£11,500 a year which Lieut. -
Gov. Darley draws as vicegerent and Chief Jus-
tice. If Premier Reid can make a decent bargain
with Darley, the interim may just as well bo
permanent.
The Yic. Sugar
Works Guarantee
Bill is to be a short
and simple measure,
and one that goes
straight to the
point. Wherever
the soil is proved
suitable for the cul-
tivation of sugar-
beet, and a number
of farmers will un-
dertake to grow a
certain quantity an-
nually, they may
form themselves
into a co, for the
purpose of erecting
a sugar-mil’, and if
they cannot find the
money required, the
Govt, will advance
it at a low rate to
include interest and
sinking fund. The
result will be that,
instead of one big
‘ ‘pri vate enterprise”
co. absorbing-all the
business, paying the
farmers what it
“darned well
pleases ” for their
produce, and earn-
ing 10 per cent,
divs., the farmers
will get whatever
profit there is in the
trade, and the agri-
cultural industry—
which always gets
left in its dealings
with the middle-
man —will be its
own middleman.
Meanwhile, the
farmers at Maffra
(V .) are starting
a large mill with-
out waiting for
State assistance. It
was by a very
similar method that
the Vic. butter-and-
cheese export trade
was created, and
with anything like
equalluck, Victoria,
five years hence,
should be able to
supply her own re-
quirements in the matter of sugar, and thus save
the .£750,000 per annum which she now sends
abroad.
Doubtless N.S. Wales will be asked to pay
the law-costs incurred by the National Ass in get-
ting the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision that
the Payment of Members Act is valid as applied
to every Legislative Assembly, and not only to
the particular Legislative Assembly which passed
it. There is even talk, in the face of this decision,
of sending a crew of lawyers to England at the
province’s expense to argue the point before the
Privy Council. Parliamentary democrats should
set summary feet on both proposals. If Fat Man
wants law, let Fat Man pay for it.
How doth the heathen rage ! Two
Kanakas were lately executed for the mur-
der of an old man near Bundaberg; an abori-
ginal has just murdered a Javanese at Mt.
Morgan ; the Mackay district reeks with the out-
rages of uncon vieted Polynesian barbarians—
another mysterious murder there last week, with
the 13 previous mysteries still unravelled ! —and
the Bananaland Ministry is perambulating the
country placidly drivelling about the benefits
derived from colored labor.
Premier Reid deserves credit for re-
engaging Chief Railway Commissioner Eddy, bub
he deserves blame for not at once having obtained
Parliamentary sanction in fairness to Eddy. The
squabble about salary is paltry. Look at the
salaries enjoyed by men managing Australian pri-
vate concerns : E. M. Young, £7OOO a year ; T. A.
Dibbs, about .£4000; Francis Adams, .£3500;
Goldsbrough’s general manager, .£3OOO, &c. And
look at the difference in the responsibilities ! The
boards who pay such salaries don’t do it out of
mere benevolence but because they get quid pro
quo.
Premier Reid has made a half-promise to
protect a local iron industry by a bonus of ss. per
ton on pig-iron and 10s. per ton on manufactured
iron, and to further help it along by giving it
Govt, contracts at 10 per cent, over English rates.
The business should pull through with this rather
liberal amount of Protection, and Mr. Reid will
deny that it is Protection, and point to the new
industry as a proof of how things go ahead under
Freetrade. Every N.S.W. Freetrade Government
for many years past has practised Protection more
or less, and pointed to the results as a proof of the
advantages of Freetrade. If only N.S.W. had
three years of genuine Freetrade, there would be
no fiscal question in the province for many years
thereafter.
TO SIR SNOWDEN.
Give loyal thanks and praises to
Her Majesty, your grateful Queen,
For that dear badge she’s given you.
You may in truth—you’re of the few,
The very few, it can’t demean.


The Wild-Cat Column.
The Ae jus lately printed a cable on theincrease
of cold production, in which the U.S. Mint Director,
Preston, is said to have declared that the increase,
" especially in Australia,” would satisfy the last fears of
the monometallists on the score of cold scarcity. The
esp ecially in Australia ’’ clause is evidently the work of
the jaded sub-editor laboring under the vague idea that
Westralia is doing wonders. The Australasian increase
has been material, but not overwhelming, and things pan
out something like this :
1893. 1891. Increase,
oz. fine. oz. fine. oz. fine.
Africa 1,381,128 1,837,773 456,645
U.S. A 1,739,323 2,080,129 340,806

Russia .. .. 1,279,734 1,354,085 74,351
Other countries ~ 1,550,000 1,665,000 115,000
7,676,622 8,956.968 1,280,346
The value of the gross increase is £5,441,471. The condi-
tion under which this increase has been gained makes it
certain that gold-getting will show big figures as long as
low prices continue.
For the present year the yield will probably
reach even 10,000,0000 z. i.e., the world will add
£42,500,000 to its gold stocks in ’9s—which means 1100
tons of pure gold 1 Every previous record sinks into
insignificance beside this.
* ♦ » *
For’94 the N.S.W. gold-yield increase was 50
per cent, greater than the Westralian increase :

The miner “ working on his own ” benefits more
of late years than formerly by the establishment of Govt,
mints, and by the improvements in transit. In W es-
tralia the banks deduct only 2s. 6d. from the value of
each oz. of gold, instead of 10s., as they would do if the
miner had to send to England. On the Palmer, in the
seventies, the butchers were the capitalists, and made a
royalty something like 12s. out of every oz. they “bought.”
On a field so import mt as Bendigo, with the alleged com-
petition of buyers, the price of standard gold so late as
’7l was £3 16s. ; now that the mint is established, and
pays £3 17s. B£d. in Melb., the Bendigo miner can secure
£3 17s. 6d. locally. In the sixties one big firm made
£IO,OOO a year by “buying” gold at the competitive
prices then reigning throughout Vic. These spoils, won
by combination, are now a thing of the past—and the
miner draws full value by getting his gold turned into
sovs.
* * ♦ ♦
Here is an awkward problem. Bi-metallists
propose, not to make silver legal tender at its present
value, which would be bi metallism pure and simple, but
to declare bylaw that this legal tender shall be worth a
lot more than its present value, which is something over
and above bi metallism. Silver just now is worth, say,
2s. 6d. per oz. By making it legal tender a further
demand will be created—how much of a demand no one
knows. This will cause the opening up of many un-
worked silver deposits and, consequently, an increased
supply—how much of an increased supply no one can
tell. The increased demand would naturally tend to
force silver up, and the increased supply would tend to
force it down, and the result would be that the price
would tend to fix itself at a figure which can’t be at pre-
sent ascertaine 1. And if this figure could be ascertained
in advance, which it can’t be, and it could be guaranteed
not to alter, which is impossible, and the bi-metallists
agreed to make the white m tal legal tender at this rate,

Sydney Mint, speaking for the close of ’93,
reckoned the N S.ff. private holdings of gold and silver
coin at £4,796,954, but it may be that this is an over-
estimate. The present N.S.W. note circulation is about
£1,244,000, and the metallic circulation wnould probably
be twice this. For all Australasia the note circulation is
nearly £4,000,000 -and on the ratio of 2 to 1 the amount
of gold and silver coin outside the banks might be
reckoned at £8,000,000. The total holdings would, there-
fore, appear to be at least £28,000,000.

The Bank of N.Z. Estates 00. proposes to raise
in London £750,000 at 4 per cent, with which to redeem
the balance of its old 5J per cent, debentures, the other
£750,000 having been paid off out of the £2,000,000 State-
guaranteed 4 per cent, stock. This is not particularly
good news to the B.N.Z. shareholders, some of whom
believed that it would be possible to pay off the entire
£1,500,000 liability out of the millions new capital
lately raised. Still the ultimate result of this rather com-
plicated settlement of affairs should be a saving of at
least £12,000 per annum to the joint concerns. The
reasons why the bank should go to London for its new
loan, at a time when any amount of money can be
obtained in Australasia at 4 per cent., are not apparent,
but the most conservative being on earth—not even
excepting the Chinaman—is the Australasian financier,
and he probably goes to London from sheer force of habit
just because his fathers went there before him. The last
time the E-dates 00. borrowed in London it was so re-
morselessly “squeezed” that the transaction nearly
ruined it and the bank together, and anybody save the
“ colonial ” financier would have kept clear of the British
money-lender thereafter.

In view of the rumor that certain Australian
financial institutions propose following the example set
by a Tasmanian one in the way of raising money by
lottery, it may be pointed out that instead of the scheme
being a novel agency for raising the wind in Australia, it
is an old N.S.W. one. Wentworth introduced in 1844,
and carried ii 1845, a Bill which empowered a particular
bank to dispose of real and personal property by lottery,
and in pursuance of the Bill about twelve thousand allot-
m nts of land, some of them of many acres, with thou-
sands of cattle and sheep, were gambled for by ticket.

The alleged “magnificent success ” of Queens-
land’s 3J per cent, loan recently floated in London is
mostly bogus, after all, like everything else that is said or
done by the Kanakaland Govt. The loan was nominally
floated at £lOl 12s. 7d., but nearly six months “ accrued
interest” was thrown in, so that the amount actually
realised was barely £IOO. When the expenses are de-
ducted the real net selling-price will probably be only
about £99. And to get this amount the loan is fixed for
half a century, so that, even if interest should go down
to 2 per cent, within the next 25 years, Queensland is
precluded from “converting” at current rates. Under
which circumstances the statement that the success of
the new “borrow” is a proof of Britain’s confid'moe in
the Nelson Ministry, and the Q.N. Bank, and the Kanaka
slave-trade and the policy of raising money in England
to make up revenue deficiencies, is pure bunkum.

Turner and Isaacs are introducing a bill into

exemption fell through in democratic S.A., and this one
will probably be thrown out by the Upper House of
democratic Victoria. Yet they have a House of Lords in
England! The principle of attachment of debts was
never intended, originally, to apply to such oases, but
was introduced by the back-door of a rule of Court. Only

The Bulletin wants to hear about results from

Dear Bulletin, —Will a mad dog swim-a
river? What is mentioned as the first case of
hydrophobia in Victoria occurred in Gippsland
the other day. The dog, after trying to bite his
master and two other men, swam the Latrobe
River twice, and then rushed aw'ay into the bush
and has not been heard of since. If a dog with
rabies is rather partial to water than otherwise,
what sense is there in calling dog-madness hydro-
phobia? My own impression is that dogs, even as
men, are subject to different kinds of insanity,
and that hydrophobia is a symptom of only one—
though that, doubtless, the most prevalent—
amongst these. What do you think ?—C.R.
An “Australasian Federated Fruit-
Growers’ Association ” was formed at a representa-
tive fruit-growers’ congress held in Hobart last
month. All the provinces but W. Australia were re-
presented by Government fruit experts, and leaders
in the movement. Victoria sent 18 ; N.S.W., II;
Queensland, 10; South Australia, 1 ; Maoriland,
8 ; and the Tasmanian fruit-growers had all a free
invitation. Secretaries were elected : Hobart,
Mr. F. W. J. Moore; N.S. W., Mr. J. W. Jaffray,
Hay-street, Sydney ; Victoria, Mr. John West,
Mooroopna; Queensland, Mr. W. Sutter,
F.R.H.S. ; South A us., Mr. W. Clarke, Chamber
of Manufactures ; Maoriland, Mr. W. S. Hampson,
Auckland. The association’s object is to advance
fruity menV interests in all possible ways ; and, if
there are any ways advantageous but impossible,
then to leap impossibilities and advance in those
ways also. To show the need for scattering know-
ledge among degenerate post-Adamites : the Vic.
Govt, nursery sent 167 kinds of apples to the
recent Tas. Exhibition, and precisely 159 of those
kinds were unsuitable for export to the London
market.
The U.S. Supreme Court has decided that
the income-tax recently imposed by Act of Con-
gress is unconstitutional, and it is, therefore,
summarily abolished. The U.S. Congress is
notoriously about as corrupt as such bodies usually
are, and the U.S. Supreme Court has a high repu-
tation for honesty; nevertheless, the principle
which permits a just bench to sit in judgment on
the doings of an unjust legislature is bad, and the
results of the system are mostly nefarious. The
law is such a jungle of precedents and techni-
calities, that when the Fat Man hires the best
available legal talent to oppose any law which
doesn’t suit his vested interests, he can generally
find some thoroughly legal means of proving it to
be “unconstitutional.” The Lean Man could do
the same if he had the money, because almost
everything is more or less unconstitutional; but,
then, he hasn’t the money. Consequently, the
Legislature, which often means to go wrong, pro-
duces far belter results, on the whole, than the
Supreme Court, which always does its best to go
right—in a strictly legal sense.
Smoke Eagle Cigarettes.
London Referee on Party Government
as it is now conducted : “ There are a dozen ques-
tions to be answered, but the elector has only one
vote. Nothing so insensate as asking a man to
vote ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to a dozen wholly different ques-
tions has ever been devised by the wit of man,
only we are so much accustomed to it in politics
that it seems to have lost its meaning to our
minds. If, now, we were to adopt it in private
life, consider what would happen. I meet a friend
in the street, and I ask him in one breath (1)
whether he does not think the weather too mild
for Christmas; (2) whether Lord George Hamilton
is an ideal Chairman of the School Board ; (3)
whether the Japanese ought to accept a big
indemnity and stop the war ; (4) whether, instead
of being at the trouble of buying a friend a
Christmas present, I ought not to send him the
money; (5) whether the Times ought to come
down to a penny; (6) whether the modern
society girl is immoral; (7) whether Beer-
bohm Tree or George Alexander is the
greater actor; (8) whether it is possible to
draw the line anywhere between the Lyceum
‘Hamlet’ and the itinerant Punch and Judy
show ; (9) whether Christmas ought to be abo-
lished ; (10) whether half the people who send
good wishes at Christmas mean them ; (11)
whether we have not too many evening papers ;
and (12) whether the New Humor is really funny.
Confine the answer to a single ‘ Yes ’ or‘No ’ on the
whole batch of questions, and what would be the
value of the opinion ? Most people, I dare say,
would be frank enough to own that in the indi-
vidual case the answer meant nothing, and could
not by any amount of ingenuity be twisted into
meaning anything. Yet, supposing the
questions I have written down constituted a party
programme—and party programmes are nowadays
made up of just such diverse elements—the answer
‘ Yes ’ or ‘No’ delivered by the electors in their
hundreds of thousands would be thought to mean
something. Is it not strange that we should have
t,he patience to discuss politics at all?”
THE HANDFUL OF THINGS WE KNOW
Several years ago an American humorist and poet
published some verses called “Little Breeches.”
This was an odd name given to a very small boy
who was caught out in a tremendous snowstorm,
and finally found in some hay quite a distance from
the house. However the boy got there bothered
everybody to explain. It was certain he never
could have walked. So his father said the angels
must have done it;“ they just stooped down and
toted him to where it was safe and warm,” he said.
The poetry about it (supposed to have been written
by the youngster’s father) starts off in this way :
I don’t go much on religion,
I never ain’t had no show ;
But I’ve a middling tight grip, sir,
On the handful of things I know.
That’s it; the handful of things we know. There
aren’t many of ’em, but there are a few. And one
of them is this : That for a hundred results there
is only one cause. Nature developes and makes
differences ; never a new force.
Here, for example, is an incident which shows
our meaning. About Christmas, 1889, Mr. E. B.
Wright had an attack of influenza. Previous to
this he had always been strong and hearty. Well
he got over the influenza ; still, it had given him
(as lie says) “a shake.” After this he got along
fairly well, until February of this year (1892) when
the influenza attacked him again. This time the
malady “meant business.” Nearly every bone
and muscle in his body ached like sore teeth. His
skin was hot and dry, and to bed he was obliged
to go. For sixteen days he was under a doctor.
At the end of that time he found himself alive
and that was about all you could say for fiim.
In his letter he goes on to tell what happened
next. “I had a foul taste in the mouth,” he says,
“and my teeth and tongue were covered with a
thick slimy phlegm. My wife says my tongue
was like an oyster-shell, and I’m sure it was rough
as a nutmeg grater. Whab I ate, which wasn’t
much, gave me pain in the chest and sides. After
a mouthful or two I felt full and blown out, and
I used to swell to a great size. By-and-by a
hacking cough set in and my breathing got short
and quick. At night I lay for hours gasping for
breath, and often coughed so I was afraid I should
burst a blood vessel. I got weaker an 1 weaker and
was like a broken-wmded horse. The doctor said
it was asthma, but he wasn’t able to relieve it.
Although I live only two minutes’ walk from the
factory where I work, 1 had to stop and rest on
my way many a time.
“ Thus matters went with me until June, 1892.
Then one day I took up the Essex Newsman, and
read of a man living at Earsham, near Bungay,
having been cured by Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup. I got some of this medicine from the
International Tea Company, Braintree. After a
few doses my breathing grew easier, and by
keeping on with the Syrup my food soon digested,
the cough left me, and I gained strength. lam
now as strong as ever, can eat anything, and walk
for miles. 1 am a brush maker, and work at the
factory of Messrs. John West and Sons, High
Street, Braintree, and have lived in this town over
forty years. (Signed) E. B. Wright, Sandpit
Road, Braintree, Essex, August 23rd, 1892.”
Now let us see how this illustrates the proposi-
tion wo started out with. For almost three years
Mr. Wright was ill with what seemed like a series
of different diseases. He had the influenza twice,
the asthma once, and another disease which he
gives no name to —even if he recognised it. Look
for a moment at the variety and incongruity of the
pains and troubles he mentions, and he doesn't
describe them all, either. You would fancy he
had half a dozen ailments at least. Yet he had
but one —indigestion and dyspepsia—of which all
his bodily disturbances (influenza included—a
blood disease) were symptoms. All came out of
the stomach, and when Seigel’s Syrup set that
right the others quietly departed.
What, then, is one thing of “the handful of
things we know?” Answer: That nearly all
sorts of diseases are really symptoms of indigestion
and dyspepsia, and that Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup cures it.
Double that fact up in your fist and hold on to
it tight.
Professor Richard and
His Critics.
(Broken Hill AGE. May 21, 1895.)
In conversation yes-
terday afternoon at
his consulting rooms
with a representative
of this journal, Pro-
fessor Richard re-
ferred to comments
upon the results of
his treatment and a
challenge which had
been thrown out to
him at his last heal-
ing demonstration at
the Town Hall.
Speaking first in re-
ference to the case of
the blind patient
whose sight has been
partially restored at the first demonstration, Pro-
fessor Richard said that he did not know the
name of the woman, nor indeed of any of his
patients. He understood, however, that the
woman was well-known locally, and had been
treated by many medical men without success,
and it was quite open to anyone who doubted the
result produced by the treatment to interview the
patient. The fact that she was able to distinguish
objects after having been for years totally
blind ought, he thought, to be sufficient
answer to his critics. Professor Richard, in
reply to a question regarding the challenge
thrown out to him, said : “ Before I can
accept a challenge, I would like to know who
the individuals are who make a challenge, and
what are their credentials. I cannot accept'a
challenge throw out by persons who are notin
the medical profession. Ido not profess to be an
engineer of electric-lights. Those persons who
have thrown cold water on me and my method of
treatment for the purpose of advertising them-
selves and those connected with them I would
strongly advise to secure the Town Hall, at their
own expense, and pay for the advertisements, and
then demonstrate to the public their skill as
tradesmen and mechanics, as I have done mine as
a medical electrician. No doubt the onlookers
would give them credit for their knowledge in
their own trade or profession. But if the medical
faculty should throw out a challenge to me
as regards my medical knowledge and the
hona fides of my method of treatment,
and secure the Town Hall, I should at
once accept the challenge. I would then suggest
that cases hitherto regarded as incurable should
be the subject of a test before a committee of
magistrates. The challengers would have the
opportunity of curing or even benefiting the cases
in one treatment, or in six treatments by galvan-
ism or medicine, or any other curative agency. If
they fail, I will undertake to succeed. I wil'
undertake to put down a stake of 2 to 1 for any
thing above ,£lOO. If the challengers win they
may retain the money ; if I win, I will undertake
to hand it to the poor of Broken Hill.” Professor
Richard, in conclusion, said that he had refrained
while in Broken Hill from attempting to discredit
the medical faculty. He hoped shortly to give
another series of healing demonstrations.
MEDICAL ELECTRICITY.
To the Editor of the Barrier Miner.
Sir, —Possibly some of your readers felt no little
contempt as they perused the jealous carping of
certain correspondents. “Professor” Richard
showed modesty rather than conceit or egotism.
He did not maintain that he would be able to re-
lieve or effect a cure in every case ; nevertheless,
he did so, and as he asked to be judged by what
he did, rather than by what he said, it matters
little if he failed sufficiently to explain scientifi-
cally “appearances.” The plaudits of the three
great crowds sufficiently expressed the opinion, as
a whole, of the people of Broken Hill, that he had
proved his ability as a medical electrician ; and,
personally, I think the time must soon come
when such men should be legally registered as
“specialists,” and not termed “quacks.” We
all welcome Edison’s wonderful discoveries in
electricity, as applied to the convenience
of commercial, and the comforts of private
life. Why should we not appreciate more the
power of electricity for the relief of suffering
humanity? Great stress is laid upon the question
of the permanency of cures. Our medical im n
effect cures ; but if their patients subsequently
continue the habits that created the disease cured
or relieved, do we blame our friends the doctors?
Should Mr. Richard succeed in sending a patient
suffering from lead-poisoning to work again before
he leaves Broken Hill, who is to be blamed if that
patient becomes bad again through the poisonous
fumes from the mines? My reply is—Your cor-
respondents, if they fail to do their best to bring
about a cessation of such poisonous mineral fumes
and dust. I have heard of a pamphlet entitled
“If Christ Came to Chicago.” I can well sup-
pose that if He came to Broken Hill He would
bless the work of Richard in his attempt to relieve
suffering humanity, and condemn those of us
who, by reason of our innate selfishness, think we
are at liberty to gain our livelihood at the cost of
the loss of the health and the lives of many of our
fellow-creatures. —I am, &c.,

pose establishing a private college for students
with the object of training nurses, &c., using the
very latest methods and appliances.
Yours, &c.,

" That which we call a rose, by any other
name would smell as sweet,” and so it
happens that we want to explain what
is MYFA? It is only a name,
the new name for Mitchell’s
“My Favorite” Tea. Why do
we change the name? Simply to
protect you from fraud. The success of
“My Favorite ” Tea has been
gigantic; its immense popularity is so
pronounced that it has numbers of imita-
tors already, who have neither the brains
nor the inclination to get an original
name of their own
A recent decision of the Supreme Court has revealed the fact that the
words “ My Favorite” can be used by anybody, and we have therefore, in
order to prevent your being misled into buying “ Favorite ” Tea, and
thinking it the celebrated blend of Mitchell’s, decided to change the name
for one that cannot be held by anyone else. . :
MITCHELL’S “MY FAVORITE” Tea will be sold in future under the
name of MYFA TEA (copyright).
We positively guarantee “ MYFA TEA ” to be the identical Tea hitherto
sold as MITCHELL’S “MY FAVORITE.” What’s in a Name? A good
deal. Be warned! In future, when you wish to purchase MITCHELL’S
“ MY FAVORITE” Tea, ask for

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “ Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-out No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ TIHIIBIBIE CASTLES ” and “
We have deilined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the interest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles” and ‘‘Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke,

Dear Bulletin,— The Sydney Good Tem-

Dr. Chalmers, because that prelate backs “fer-
mented wine ” as being the “ real Mackay ” of the
Bible, What has particularly made the teetotal
fur fly is the statement of Sydney journals report-
ing the Right Rev. Chalmers as having said that
“any person likely to lapse into drinking habits
by sipping fermented wine at the Sacrament has
no right to partake of the Sacrament.” To which
common-sense would say, “Hear hear” were
there any such probability, or even more than
scant possibility. Dr. Chalmers “ didn’t ought ”
to scare such tender feet with a bogey. “ Wine ”
never yet wet-nursed a dipsomaniac. No positive
drunkard ever yet dreamed of opening up a
“ bender a campaign of liquoring—on “ wine.”
No negative drunkard ever yet fluked on to a

There be spirit-swallowers, beer-bibbers, and wine-

spirit-swallower gets brain-maddened ; the beer-
bibber “ tanked ” and brain-drowsed; the wine-
warmer brain-titillated. Also, the spirit-swal-
lower vaporises his “higher levels,” and leaves
the “lower levels” dry; the beer-bibber floods
his “lower levels” and drowses his “upper

A Matter of Economy.
According to custom in New South Wales,
when a prisoner accused of a capital offence has
no money with which to pay for his defence,
t^% Wn all ° WS tl,e miseral,l y inadequate sum
oi 7s. to hire a cheap solicitor on his behalf,
and £lO 10s. for a cheap barrister. On several
recent occasions, however, even this paltrv sum
has been refused, on the ground that “no"funds
are available.” The prisoners were, therefore,
defended by unpaid counsel “assigned ” by the
Judge, on the morning upon which the Court
sittings begin. The counsel “ assigned ” under
such circumstances is generally a man who has
little business, no experience worth mention-
ing, and any amount of time to spend on unre-
raunerative jobs. He has either to pay out of
his own pocket the expenses of hunting up
evidenceortodo without evidence, and lie usually
has to take the latter course. The apparent
reason why the Government can’t fulfil its
obligations in this small matter, so as to give
an impecunious prisoner at least some slight
semblance of a fair trial for his life, is that
£13,000 is being spent on the statue of Governor
Phillips, the first gaoler, and boss hangman
and flogger of Botany Bay, and Phillip’s statue
has absorbed ail the available coin. Crick,
M.L.A., drew attention to this matter recently
in the Assembly, and the reply of Minister of
Justice Gould— the godfather of the new
“painless” nickel-plated gag—was mainly
to the effect that the question had been
raised “for purposes of advertisement.”
Also, he grew eloquent on the sub-
ject that the Attorney - General had lost
no time in the matter, but had refused to
pay up the customary ,£l7 17s. after only
twelve hours’ consideration ; and that he had
three times written to Crick’s partner “asking
him to call”—in order that he might be
officially informed that he could defend the
prisoner at his own expense if he liked; and
Premier Reid declared, in a loud voice, that
theadministration of justice was being “dragged
through the mire.” He also complained that
Crick hadn’t written to him, while Minister
for Justice Gould complained that Crick had
written to him twice. But neither answer even
touched on the matter really at issue—
that when the Crown engages the police-
detectives, Crown Law Department, Attorney-
General, public prosecutor and the Treasury to
hunt up evidence against a penniless man ar-
raigned for his life, and who is in gaol and can’t
look for his own witnesses, and it refuses to
pay even the miserably small sum commonly
allowed for his defence, it is just in the same
position as Commodus when he went down into
the arena and stuck his sword through an un-
armed gladiator. The Ministry, in fact, care-
fully said nothing at all- about the question
involved, and merely “shied” its little lump of
mud with a feeble aim at the man who insisted
on digging up the unpleasant question.
Premier Rosebery has introduced in the Lords
his Bill enabling colonial Judges to sit on the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The
important point of salaries is not dealt with,
for it would not have been judicious for the
Lords even to hint interference with the Com-
mons’ prerogative, lest the jealous representa-
tives should throw the Bill out altogether. But
“it is understood” that the Imperial Govt,
will find the cash—if the Commons does not
object. If the Commons does object, an effort
will doubtless be made to get “ the colonies ” to
pay up. As the chief purpose of the agitation
is to provide fat billets for Australian Judges
with Jingo tendencies, it was evident at once
that this vagueness on the vital point of screw
would never do. So the barrackers who are
pulling the leg of London Times complained
that the measure was “microscopic and tenta-
tive,” and the barrackers who are pulling the
wires of S.M. Herald echoed that it was most
unsatisfactory. The hint that “ former colonial
Judges ” will be allowed to sit also rouses the
Herald to indignant fury on behalf of the very
present “colonial Judges ” who are itching for
the billets. Altogether, Premier Rosebery’s
endeavor to add “another link to the golden
chain ” of kinship cannot be voted a success.
The Bulletin is still waiting, in order that the
Imperialistic snake may be scotched before it is
fairly alive, for a Democratic M.P. of every
Australian province to move that Rosebery’s
proposal is unnecessary and unacceptable.
N.S. W. Full Court has decided that, where a
municipality supplies gas or electric-light, or
any other service, any person making use
thereof becomes a contractor, “within the
meaning of the Act,” and can’t legally be a
mayor or alderman. In such a city as Glasgow,
therefore, under this rule, the only kind of
person eligible as a mayor or member of the
council would be one who never washed him-
self or drank water, never used gas or elec-
tricity, never rode in a tram-car, never had his
dust-bin emptied, or the street swept in front
of his house—who never did anything, in fact.
Considering that the person who uses a
municipal electric - light doesn’t “contract”
in any ordinary acceptation of the term, but
merely buys an article which is offered for
sale at a fixed price, the decision of the Full
Court looks like a piece of learned and archaic
foolishness. Unluckily, the Court doesn’t exist
so much to enforce the spirit of the law as to
dig out wonderfully profound reasons why the
law should be null and void. Acts of Parlia-
ment are often, no doubt, thrown together in a
loose and haphazard fashion, but still no half-
dozen laws could be drawn up—even if all the
learned lawyers of the province spent a year
over the work-in which a Full Court couldn’t
pick large holes. The reason is that it is
so much easier at all times to destroy
than to create. Parliament is the artist who
has to paint the picture, while all the Full
Court has to do is to throw a brick through it
when it is finished. The production of the
picture is so difficult and the brick-throwing is
so easy that a good many of the jibes levelled
against the Legislatures are wholly undeserved.
Probably if the Full Court drafted the laws,
and then the 12 stupidest men in the Assembly
sat in judgment upon them, quite as many holes
would be discovered as at present. Most laws
are drafted by lawyers, and then they are
afterwards proved, also by lawyers—sometimes
by the same lawyers— to be no earthly good.
And as lawyers live and move and have their
tees and refreshers by this sort of verbal quib-
bling, and it has been carried to such perfection
that now no one really knows what the law is,
or what or where it isn’t, a time has at last
arrived when the whole civil code dunno where
e are.
Cardinal Moran’s Book.
Card. Moran’s book is a painstaking record of facts
which have a good deal of interest for the Catholic
sectary, and a good deal less interest for anybody
else, Ihe author hardly ever takes the rdle of ex-
pounder or commentator. Occasionally he turns
aside to recount, with considerable naivete, a
dubious miracle or a trivial anecdote ; but for the
most part he is satisfied to link reference and
quotation in chronological narrative. From
ms standpoint there was probably no alternative.
Mad he deserted details and minutiae in order to
give a vivid picture of the life and struggles of his
church, of its achievements outside the field of
sacerdotalism, of its influence on contemporary
thought and conduct, lie would indeed have done
more service to literature, but he would have done
less to Ins sect. So his “ history ” remains chiefly
a laborious sectarian chronicle.
* * *
For the writing of history, in fact, Card. Moran
seems to have little equipment beyond his zeal.
His literary style is moderate: in 1000 pages
he has not written much which invites
quotation. He grants authority to news-
paper-clippings which support his own side,
and denies it to the weighty arguments which
have induced every Australasian province but
Westralia to establish a system of secular educa-
tion, and to disestablish denominational schools.
He is not too particular to score a point over
Henry Parkes (whose statements that “it is the
peculiar genius of the Roman Catholic Church to
thrive upon the enslavement of the human in-
tellect, and that the priests oppose secular educa-
tion “ because the rearing of children in the free
exercise of their faculties is death to their calling,”
are as true to-day as when made) by stating the
half-truth that for 14 years before the passage of
the N.S.W. Public Instruction Act of ’79,
appointments of teachers in the Catholic
schools were made, not by the priests or
managers, but by the Council of Education
through its inspectors. That is so ; but the
inspectors had, of course, to choose Catholics
from the candidates with which the priests and
managers supplied them, and they cannot, with a
restricted choice, be held accountable for the
deficiencies which Mr. Parkes alleges existed in
the CatholU teaching body. They had “the
pick of the basket ” —but what a basket I Nor is
Card. Moran too careful not to confuse Thos.
Mackay, editor of the various essays called “ A
Plea for Liberty,” with Charles Fairfield, who
makes in one of the essays a statement which it
suits Card. Moran to quote ; but which Mackay
no more “attests” than the man in the moon.
* * #
Card. Moran’s book is lopped off short in the
middle, as if he had suddenly found his material
too big for his space. The three heroes of the
Catholic Church in Australasia are Archbishop
Ullathorne, Archbishop Folding, and Archbishop
Vaughan. Only the two first are adequately
dealt with. The extracts from the pamphlet by
Archbishop Ullathorne on “The Catholic Mis-
sion ” (Lond., 1837) cover the pages best worth
reading in the book. Archbishop Vaughan’s 10
militant years get only a poor 30 pages (besides
some references in a chapter on “The Education
Question). If it is the printers, however, whose
imperative mood has done this wrong to “the
Catholic Church in Australasia,” they have tried
their best to atone by making Card. Moran’s book
a credit to local typography. It is profusely
illustrated, and the binding of the copy which has
reached this paper is most admirable.

manufactures largely, has a big business in racing-

Take a couple of Fletcher’s Pills every second
night; they are a prompt and sure cure and give

FLEI’CHER’S PILLS are a quick, sure and
reliable remedy for all complaints arising from
torpid liver, indigestion, weak stomach, and im-
purities of the blood. They are prepared on
rational and sensible lines and do not contain a
particle of calomel, gamboge, or any drastic
purgative, but operate by perfectly natural means,
by stimulating the liver and increasing the flow of
bile and thus producing easy evacuations and
eatharses without the annoyance and pain of
griping and purering.
Beware of the many harmful substitutes on sale
in many shops. None are genuine unless they
bear the signature of F. Moore Clements on the
outside wrapper. CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS have become such house-
hold words that imitations are frequently offered.
We contend that this imitation is the sincerest
proof of their virtues, so see that you always get
the genuine, bearing the name and address of F.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Melb, football-goera are rather disgusted with
the game as at present played. The chief complaints are
that there are too many men on the hall, and that the
umpires are too particular about pushing, &c., giving
free-kicks for the least touch. To see a match such as
that lately played between Footscray and Melbourne, one
would think the players were made of glass. A man
couldn t be touched without the free-kick penalty being
incurred. And, strangely enough, anyone reading the
list of complaints will see that none of them are to be
found in the Rugby game—to which the visit of the M.L.
team may give strong impetus.

The Norwood team, in their Melb. match the
other day, introduced some novel tactics which surprised
both players and spectators. One (rick was so simple it
seemed strange no one had thought of it before. Stand-
ing to receive a long mark, as an Essendon man ap-
proached, the Norwood man would drop both hands to
his side, stand still, and allow the ball to pass him. The
Victorian, thinking he would mark and run, would hold
him, as is customary, and the Norwood player being held
while not in possession of the ball, would appeal for and
get a free kick.

Barracking, ’’the lowest form of encouraging
your own side and discouraging the opponents, is becom-
ing a public disgrace in Sydney and suburbs. Last Satur-
day, in the junior match Petersham v. Leichhardt, the
local crowd continually insulted referee M'Manamey. The
rabble that follows the Sydney University team is among
the loudest and worst of the “ barrackers,” and because
the University mob “barracks,” other mobs think it
quite the thing, and, therefore, howl, groan and boo-hoo
likewise.

ihe Sydney match, Wallaroo v. University, was
won by the latter by 8 points to 6. It was anybody’s
game till the last whistle went, for the Wallaroo forwards
are far better than University’s, and kept their opponents
continually on the defensive. But any two of the Wal-
laroo backs are not equal to Abbott, and he, by grand
play, scored two tries and one goal for his side, and thus
won the match. The University team has a doctor play-
uig —a solid person with 3ft. of beam, and whenever a
player was laid out (there were quite a number of tem-
porary corpses) the doctor capered to the spot, and, in
quite a professional way, conducted an examination.
Once, when a player’s nether garments were badly torn,
the doctor recommended a sweater which fell to
the knees. The advice was adopted. The Wallaroos have
a popular amateur boxer in their ranks.

In extenuation of cash cycling it has just been
written that “ the object in racing for cash is not to make
money out of the sport. It costs a man £6O to throw his
leg over bis machine before he can hope to race. He has
to pay £25 for a roadster, and 30 guineas for a racing-
machine. Then he has to pay a man to train him. There-
fore, to enable a man to recoup himself for his outlay,
there must be substantial mom-y-prizes. Without money-

It is quite evident that O’Brien and Walker

because Lewis took the inside running. The committee
upheld Keil’s protest, but public opinion was strongly
for Lewis. So in the final O’Brien and Walker allowed
Keil to sail away with the tandem, and raced one another
home for second place—the post of honor. The public
and the other cyclists cheered. Later in the day Lewis
won Ihe half-mile open handicap, and the 25 miles’ cham-
pionship of Victoria. He won this race in fine style, and
lowered the record. The previous hour’s record' was 22

Fate pursues some stables whenever their horses
start hot favorites, and luck attends them whenever the
public is “not on.” Singularly enough, such stables
represent many conflicting interests, as a rule.

One of the finest-looking colts seen for some
time is Bandmaster, the well-named Strathmore—Melo-
dous prize in the St. Alban’s lottery, who has the blood
of such wonders ns Fisherman, Barb, and Musket under
his brown coat. Bis sire, Strathmore, was without doubt
the best horse of his year, and with a bit of luck should
have been No. lin the Cup of ’9l. His win in the Cham-
pion proved he could slay. Melodious, besides being
sister to the great Melos, gave us Meli and Wallace.

Trenton, while at the stud, has sired more
winners than any oilier horse in Australia. What price
his colt by Carbine’s dam, old Mersey, and foaled to Eng-

Petronel, the son of Musket, is not owned by
the Duke of Portland, but by His Grace of Beaufort.
The grand old winner of the Two Thousand of ’BO has a
full list for the next two seasons. He is beautifully-
formed and much handsomer than Carbine, whom he
heats in all measurements. His stock are very promising.
The Bulletin’s London correspondent hears that some
people in England are nibbling at Nordenfeldt. There is
in fact, a regular craze for the Musket blood just now’
and with good reason, as stayers become scarcer year by
year. J

Croker and Dwyer, the Yankee sports, scored a
win the first time of asking, at Newmarket, with Eau
Gallic, a son of Iroquois. Sims (colored) rode the colt
and much amused the cognoscenti by his style of horse-
manship, as by comparison with English riders he seemed
to sit with his knees in his mouth. However, “ hand-
some is as handsome does,” and getting oft like a flash
from a gun he made the running from end to end and
scored. The success of the American horse is a triumph
for “the watch,” as the race was run to a tick as shown
by a time trial.

The cash cyclist or bogus amateur has a special
history. Years ago he began cycling for pleasure ; he
stayed .n at night and saved up enough money to pay for
his machine. He argued that the bicycle was a rare prize
and the cheapest servant on earth—it ate no corn, it
didn’t want a groom to keep it clean, and on its hack a
man could ride through the fresh country 60 or 70 milesa
day. As for the exercise involved 1 Bah !it was health-
ful and invigorating. Then he began to form clubs and

THE SOLE REASON
WHY YOU SHOULD INSIST ON
CLEMENTS TONIC
Is because of its merits. Remember “ Bilson’s
Tonic ” will not do you any good “ because ” Syd.
Gregory made 200 runs, nor “ because ” Megson
won the championship, there being no connection
between them. You might just as well expect
Bolus’ pills to cure you because they are the same
shape as the earth. Remember ! When you are
sick you want a remedy of proved therapeutic
value, and not an imitation or substitute for one.
THE ONLY REASON
We have ever put forward in favour of Clements
Tonic is its efficacy, and this has been proved
thousands of times, and this is just the reason of
the crowd of servile imitators who trade on our
reputation and the renown of Clements Tonic.
DON’T BE DIDDLED !
Insist on having the proved and genuine article,
that you have proof and evidence of its power to
cure disease. None of the vile imitations will do
any good, and you only waste your money and
perhaps risk your life by being bamboozled into
purchasing imitations. Listen to no specious
blarney or plausible humbug about “tonics.”
Remember, Clements Tonic has many virtues
besides its restorative properties, therefore it is
best. You know you can depend on its curative
properties, and neither you nor anyone else knows
anything of the imitations, because they are only
made to sell.
NOTE!
There is only one reason why you should insist
on Clements Tonic, that is, its proved efficacy,
therapeutic value and reliability.
There are scores of reasons against the imita-
tions, some of which are :
1. Their only raison d'etre is to line the pockets
of the vendors.
2. They never were heard of till Clements Tonic
was discovered and made its reputation.
3. They have no merits and no proved value.
4. They must be inferior in quality or they
would not cost less money and allow the
sellers a bigger profit than Clements Tonic
does.
5. You only waste your money.
6. Your case may progress beyond cure whilst you
are trusting in a false security.
7. That the mere fact of their being called
“Brown’s,” “Jones’,” or “Robinson’s”
Tonic is proof of the attempt to trade on
our reputation, because if their mixtures
had any real value they would adopt a new
name and thus get the full benefit due to the
virtues of their own article.

to bold race-meetings. He raced as a hona-fide amateur
for prizes ; and pictures of him are to be seen, with the
rider standing by his “ bike,” and cups and clocks and
spoons and forks, and other glory. Then ’cycle-makers
saw a chance to push biz, and when a rider made a record
they presented him with their best bicycle, or sold it to
him at half price, and when said rider made more records
they advertised the fact and made much of him to sell
their brand of ’cycle. Then the rider began to ask
whether he couldn’t make money at the game, so he
either bought a share in a biz. or started one “on his
own." And then he took sub-champions into his employ
and corrupted them with the notion of cash, and the sub-
ohampions corrupted the whole race of amateur cyclists,
and the result is that the cyclists have all become cash or
bogus amateurs.

Kadavu Levu, the second highest chief in Fiji
(he will be the highest when his father dies) is a remark-
ably powerful athlete. At cricket he is a tremendous
slogger ; he often hits the ball from the middle of the
Suva ground into the sea. At Auckland, M.L., he made
the biggest stroke ever seen there.

A year or two ago someone taught the Fijian
natives football, and when H.B.M.S. Orlando visited Suva
a game of football was arranged between the lithe,
brawny Fijians and a team of bluejackets. Never before
had Jack-tars played Fijians football; never again will
they. For it was not football, it was bull-fight; it was
Jack-tar in the air, Jack-tar gruelled and twisted and
carried on stretchers aboard H.M. Orlando, to the sound
of muffled drum. And in the wake of the flying squad
oame the Fijian braves chanting a death-song, and loudly
cursing the fate that cheated them of a cannibal feast.

The dispute about the rowing amateur defini-
tion recalls the old English athletic wrangle, when men
who sold cloth by the piece would not compete against
those who sold by the yard. But snobbery of that kind
collapsed when the University men—prominent among
them B. R. Wise—put amateurism on the broad basis of
“ fun, not lucre,” and gave it practical effect by them-
selves competing agaii st farm-labnrors and mechanics.

The story goes that attorney Crick’s seat
in N.S.W. Assembly will be challenged, on the
alleged ground that he has, contrary to the pro-
visions of the Constitution Act, entered into con-
tracts of profit with the Crown —by accepting
Treasury money for the defence of capitally-
arraigned prisoners. Even so, there is nobody in
Australia who could beat Crick in West Mac-
quarie—especially at the present juncture.
Yic. postal authorities recently handed
over to the press a dead letter showing the spirit
in which one soulless male has received the
advances of the New Woman. The letter is
an answer to a proposal of marriage from some en-
terprising spinster, and the writer, after expres-
sing his gratification, &0., states that he is for-
warding to his admirer by accompanying mail an
old damaged shirt. The nature of his final answer
to her proposal, he says, will depend upon the ex-
pertness she displays in restoring that shirt to a
habitable condition. The experiment went wrong
in the post, but the man who would marry a
woman on the strength of an old shirt deserves all
he is likely to get.
The leading Germans of Adelaide have
appealed to the German women of S.A. to register
as voters without fail. The five local German
pastors back up this appeal by a letter in which
they refer to the woman-suffrage law as one
“hated by Germans,” but of which, as it is
the law, the Germans must avail themselves to
preserve their civil and religious freedom. In
Ohio, America, they point out, the Legislature,
elected with the help of the women, of whom
a majority consisted of members of English sects,
nearly passed a bill according to which every
Lutheran pastor who used wine in the celebration
of the Lord’s Supper would be thrown into gaol.
“ Did not the sects in America try to close by
force the church schools of our Lutheran co-reli-
gionists in America, and to force them to send
their children into the irreligious State schools ?
Let us, therefore, not lay our hands in our laps,
but let us fulfil all our civil duties.”
“ Crom-a-boo,” the irresistibly funny and
rollicking Irish song of the Hoben Brothers, which
Sappho Smith opined would prove “ a terrible
success,” is already proving. Lonnen has taken
it up in London, and Lauri is to sing it in
Australia; it is to be well introduced in America,
and in Maoriland. where that clever comedian,
Percy, of the Pollard Lilliputians, is making a
feature of it. It is also a universal success and
heard everywhere. Paling’s have already cleared
the first big edition, and have got out two others
in E flat and F. It is certainly the funniest Irish
football-song ever written, and the press every-
where has risen to describe it as the best comic
song of the day, and funnier than “ Killaloe ” or
“ Ballyhooley.” It is just the thing ior an aspir-
ing oomique, pro. or amateur.*
At latest dates the Victorian Crown Law
authorities were trying to settle the painfully
funny question as to whether the action of an ex-
M.P. in travelling on an expired railway pass,
which he had been requested to give up, revealed
any “felonious intent.” They decided long ago
that a prosecution of the ex-member would lie on
the ground of “felonious intent,” but seeing that
the aforesaid ground is an unapproachable allot-
ment in the gentleman’s heart, the Crown Law
authorities can’t swear that it is there to lie upon.
Meanwhile, the prosecution of hundreds of ordi-
nary people for travelling without a ticket, or
riding in first-class carriages with second-class
tickets, has assumed a new complexion. They
have been summoned and fined without proof of
felonious intent, and, consequently, should be in
a position to sue the Railway Department for
damages on the evidence of the Crown Law oracles,
who state that a prosecution in such oases cannot
lie.

In 1890 the gold coin in circulation throughout
the world was 5i limes as much as in 1848 ; the silver coin
more than twice as much ; the paper money 3J times as
much. Altogether there was in 1890 three times as much
money as 42 years previously. This seems to utterly
knock the bottom out of the silver cranks’ theory that
prices have fallen owing to the scarcity of the “circulat-
ing meijum.”
* * * *
Apart from all currency bigotries, the fall in
silver is bringing quite anew danger into speaking dis-
tance. The counterfeiter can now produce at a large
profit unexceptionable imitations of the British, German,
French, and U.S.A, silver coins—the counterfeits being
perfect in assay, design, weight, and workmanship, and
undist inguishahle by any process whatever from genuine
goods. British silver coin is issued at a valuation of ss. 6d.
p w oz. standard— i.e., two half-crowns and a sixpence
weigh loz. (troy). The market value of the metal in a
shilling, when silver is at 33i1. per oz, is 6d. —when silver
is 30 1., about s.Jd.—when silver is 27d., about sd. Taking
silv r at 30ch, the value of the metal in £IOO British silver
coin is £45 9s. Id., the expenses of coining to a (strictly)
private syndicate working on a commensurate scale soine-
w ere in the South Seas might bring the cost up to £6O.
As ther • is practically no limit to the amount that could
be put judiciously into circulation, the margin of profit
has big attractions.
Value for value, British coins contain 2J per
cent, more silver than the silver tender of France and
U.S.A., so that the advantage would be a trifle larger for
these countries. Spurious shillings have already reached
Australia from China, but they are, as a rule, stiuck from
badly-cut dies. Tue matter at the present, juncture does
not concern Australia much. The profit on the local
silver is all taken by England, and there does nob seem
to be any earnestness on the part of Parliament to secure
amendment of the rule. So, whether Australia pays
seigniorage to London, or to a South Seas counterfeiting
syndicate, is not a thing of much, concern. So long
as the seigniorage must be paid away it does not matter
what foreigner gets it.

A warning to busbmen—storekeepers, dealers,
drovers, and pub-keepers. Station cheques, which are
often on city banks, pass current for many months—first
because the station is thought “ as safe as the bank,”
and, second, because nobody' wants to pay exchange. But
these cheques are signed by the manager ; and suppose
the manager has a row with the station and is “sacked,”
or is retrenched ! The station may honor the cheque, of
course ; but in some recent Western cases it hasn’t, on
the ground that the manager has failed to “settle his
accounts.”

Beet can be grown in cold regions where the cane
and the imported nigger don’t flourish, and its advan-
tages can be gauged by the fact that nearly two-thirds
of the world's sugar-supply now comes from this
roat. When Federation arrives, and there is Free-
trade throughout Australia, it is just possible
that the N.S.W. cane industry will be unable to hold
its own against that of tropical Queensland, while
Victoria is altogether out of the sugar-cane industry.
Therefore, the two southern provinces have every reason
for pushing on their new experiment.

Someone named Pearce said in London recently :
“ Lord Percy Douglas was known and respected by e\ ery
working miner in W.A., and it was purely through his
efforts that the gold-mining industry there was where it
was to-day.” And what about Lord Percy’s fox-terriers?
They are nice dogs, and are always with him; and, though
they have done a lot of gold-mining and have reported on
many mines, nobody gives them a line.

Moran, member for CoolgarcLs, is alarmed at
the over-capitalisation of W.A. mines floated in London,
and suggests Govt, supervision. W.A. Govt, supervision!
How nicely they supervised the Wealth of Nations and
the North and South Londonderry Blocks! All’s well
that ends ill for the W.A. Govt. They still have the
Wealth of Nations, and just as the Blocks were “ going
off” in London the Londonderry smash occurred; the
purchase-money was withdrawn from Perth, and the
Govt, crowd was “left” again.

Burbank’s Coolgardie is again reported to have
been sold for £30,000 cash and a lot of shares in a £160,000
co. The public are sick of hearing of the sale of this
show, and so are doubtless the shareholders.

A Johannesburg correspondent to The Bulle-
tin (March 4): “Our market continues to boom, and
flotations and reconstructions are the order of the day.
The Feb. output of 169,2950 z., although less than Janu-
ary’s, is 17,4250 z. better than for Feb. last year. The
great feature of the Rand is now the development of
deep level mining; and the colossal undertakings of
the Rand Mines G.M. Cos. will certainly be a striking
feature of the gold-mining history of the century. A
second, or lower, series of deep levels has been com-
menced at the Simmer and Jack, which expects to get
the reef at about 3000 ft. How much deeper they will
find it practicable to work remains to be seen. We get
some very sensational reports from W.A. They tell us
that 30oz. to the ton is quite common there ; but an
average of lOdwts. suits here very well.
“During 1894 thirty corapanieson theßand mam
reef, working 1650 stamps, crushed 1,987,000 tons ore for
1,346,1770 z.; value, £4,635,600; or 13|dwts. (47/6) per
ton. Seventeen companies paid divs. aggregating
£1,152,103. Most of the remaining 13 main reef co.’s are ex-
pected to pay divs. this year, when development is further
advanced. These oo.’s by no means represent the whole
of the working properties of the Rand, as 47 contributed
to the Feb. output of 169,2950 z. The main reef is fully
proved as regards outcrop co.’s, and there seems little
reason to doubt that the adjoining deep levels will also
pay divs. Other reefs, notably' the Black, have been
proved in several places, and promise well.”

“ The Scott-Knox patent mineral concentrator
and separator, the latest and best machine for treating
battery' crushings and tailings,” gained first prize at the
recent Agricultural Society’s Show in Sydney, and proved
the most attractive exhibit upon the ground. The
machine worked all day every day during show-time, and,
under the guiding hand of its inventor, there is no deny-
ing that it gave excellent results. Ils mechanism was
investigated by Mr. James Taylor, the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Metallurgist; he subjected it to a severe test, and
expressed his official opinion upon it in the following
terms to the Minister for Mines: —“The machine as
exhibited is said to require less than one-half h.p. to
drive, and to be capable of taking the tailings from ten
stamps. It is claimed that all quicksilver floured or other-
wise carried off by the pulp is caught in the upper dish,
whence it is removed from time to time as may be
necessary. The concentrates are collected in a box
beneath the lower dish. The whole is built in a substan-
tial and workmanlike manner, and, judging from the
demonstrations given, the machine will do good work.
Whether it can do better work than is being done by
machines of established repute remains to be proved. It
is intended to have one working shortly in a battery
running other concentrators, and working the two under
equal conditions as far as possible ; when, with equal re-
sults, the much lower cost of the Soott-Knox machine
will tell in its favor.” The machine is the property of a
company whose present office is at 53 and 55 Hunter-street,
Newcastle.

A Melb. remittance-man has just gob ahead of.
Uncle Mo’. Generally, about a month before his quarterly
payment came to hand, he was compelled to part (tem-
porarily) with an expensive diamond-pin, on which
“Minefrendt” willingly advanced £3O. So often had
this little transaction been repeated that whenever he
entered the money-lender’s office, the latter would, with-
out being asked, count out the usual £3O. However, the
prodigal lately had a tempting offer for the diamond,
which he accepted, and had a paste one put in its place.
Being short, lie once more repaired to Uncle’s. The
£3O was, of course, forthcoming, and the pin safely stowed
away. When it was not redeemed, two months later,
Mo’, got suspicious, examined the pledge, and—cursed
his eyesight.
S. R. Wilson, at one time a very prominent figure
at Broken Hill, and brother of the famous W.E., is manage
ing the leases held at Hermes by his brother’s syndicate.
The syndicate employs many hands, amongst them being a
son of Richard Speight, ex-chairman of the Vic. Railway
Commissioners, who is engaged on picK-and-shovel work ;
a son of “Boh” Walsh, formerly one of the Vic. Crown
prosecutors, and now acting County Court Judge ; and a
nephew of a Melb. newspaper-proprietor, once possessor
of a six-figured fortune.

STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-street, Sydney, in the Colony of New
South Wales, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows: Whereas I suffered severely fiom
a very troublesome affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that I was quite unable to
attend to my business. I tried several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas I, as
a last hope, obtained some of Herr Bassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alkaline Vitality Pills,”
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare Completely Cured Me within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since. The Alkaline Pills also
cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true.—
THOS. MUDIMAN.

Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testi-
mony carries special weight, writes thus : To Herr Rassmussen.—Dear Sir, - I think it my duty tc
inform you that a course of your Alfahne Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my nervous system,
and, in consequence, I have recommended them to many friends, who ha ve all been cured by theii
use.—Yours, R. A. LUCKFAM.
A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and Biliousness.
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb., July 18, 1892.
Dear Sir.—l have much pleasure to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention that several of toy friends
to whom I have recommended your remedies have derived great benet r,
from them; therefore, I consider you are deserving of success, wmct
I do most heartily wish you.
Yours gratefully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th. 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be moat happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper o(
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours,
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated—

efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.

THE MOST IMPORTANT Wo..r*
EVER WRITTEN
BY A PRINCE OF THE CHURCH.
HISTORY
OF THE
CATHOLIC CHURCH
IN
AUSTRALASIA.
By PATRICK FRANCIS CARDINAL MORAN.
The History op the Catholic Church in Austral-
asia is a Crown Quarto edition and contains
nearly 1100 pp., which are embellished and beautified
with illustrations of different individuals and buildings.
The engravings consist of portraits of all the notable
Chur on dignitaries— past ana present—a.....
assisted in the founding and building up of the
Church under the Southern Cross. A number of
prominent laymen closely connected with the
Church also find a place within its pages, together
with illustrations of the Convents, Colleges, and
other institutions, which have done so much to
bring the Church in Australasia to its present
proud position. The illustrations alone are worth
more than double the price of the book, awakening
as they do pleasant associations past and present.
No reasonable expense has been spared in its
publication, aud we are satisfied that in its general
get-up it will compare favourably with works
issued from the most prominent English and
American publishing houses.
Ist. The world-wide reputation held by His
Eminence the Cardinal as an Historian and
Author, which, coupled with the fact that
neither expense nor time has been spared in
order that the History may be complete in
every respect, guarantees for it a reception
of a national character amongst the entire
English-speaking race.
2nd. That the vast amount of detail at command,
comprising as it does the first century’s his-
tory of Australasian life and grand develop,
ment of the noble work accomplished by our
self-sacrificing pioneers, provides an almost
inexhaustible fund of thrilling episodes of
personal and public events, which cannot
fail to charm aud enlighten the reader-
irrespective of creed—combining as it does
a great literary triumph together with a
treasure store of untold wealth of important
historic information, covering the whole
range of affairs, both clerical and lay,
affecting the Church in Australia and New
Zealand.

SOME ST. ALBAN'S CHRONICLES.
ZAtmsKl, brother to Havoc, was one of the best
PhaTnS 1 T? WaS 6Ver , at o fc - Alban ’ s * and, in the
Ohampion Race won by Strathmore, Mr. W. R.
Wilson had to back them both. Had the race been
th ®. manner most suitable for Zalinski,
probably his name would have been enrolled
amongst the winners of the greatest classic race in
the colonies.
• # •
Zalmski was heavily backed during the pre-
ceding winter for the Melbourne Cup of 1893, but
unfortunately developed a “leg.” Mr. W, R
Wdson unlike some owners, immediately
scratched him, and never tried to get out of his
money.
* * *
Some years ago an astute old trainer and horse-
owner who lived afc Flemington arranged with a
former proprietor of St. Alban’s to have a “trial
on the quiet. The Flemington man arrived at
b-eelong by the afternoon train, and when going
through the town became aware that he was fol-
lowed, evidently by someone who wished to know
where he was going. Next morning early the
paint-brush was used to change a chestnut with
four white legs into a bay, and a bay into a chest-
nu.t ™ th L v y h,to , ]e S s - Th e trial took place, and
actually before the owners got to town the horse
badly beaten was a hot “first favorite ” for the
Australian Cup, and the winner of the trial was
knocked out. Fact.
* * *
When a celebrated Scotch divine, who is married
to the daughter of a leading Geelongite, was inter-
viewing Trenton at St. Alban’s, he expressed the
opinion that he would mate such a sire with a pure
Arab mare, and proceeded to give his reasons.
Archie x mile, who was standing by, quietly
asked him if he thought a daughter of Cain would
nick well with an Englishman, for that was a
similar case ? His reverence took it kindly, and,
strange to say, saw the simile.
Some talented theatrical artistes have paid visits
to bt. Alban’s at different times, amongst them
being poor Fred Leslie, of the Gaiety co., whose
story of the tune he visited the Duke of West-
minster s stud at Eaton Park brought down the
house.
• * *
. Man ,y visitors to St. Alban’s have displayed an
inquiring turn of mind as regards the racehorses,
hoping, no doubt, to pick up some knowledge
whereby they might line their pockets, but the
training-ground is so well marked off that unless
the onlooker is up-to-date as regards the posts, he
might as well stay in bed as try to secure a surrep-
titious tip. 1

• couple of illustrations re St. Alban’s are given

breorge Adam’s announcement of the great art-
union published elsewhere.

Mr. Nathan Herman, of the Misfit Par-
lors, No. 9 Wynyard-street, Sydney—the place
tf l e banner is, and where the immense
J looks like a frozen boa-constrictor over the
door, and the huge lamp serves as a beacon to
guide the wandering footsteps of the pilgrim from
the busu—-has vastly increased his business within
the last few weeks. A mammoth new depart-
ment has been added for the sale of furniture
crockery, pianos, bedding, ironmongery, &c., and
[h ■ young man who is going to get married, and
be afterwards run-in on his mother-in-law’s evi-
dence, can here find absolutely everything that
he wants. A new feature of the jewellery depart-
ment is the reliable watch, with gilt chain which
looks like gold-all for 6s. 6d. The misfit tobacco
and cigar department has been greatly enlarged,
and all kinds of plugs are now supplied. Herman’s
tea is a wonderful speciality. The dress and
mantle department has also greatly expanded, and
a large staff of ladies—most of them young and
beautiful are kept on hand to make all necessary
alterations while you wait. Sundry large ship-
ments of Brussels carpets have arrived, and are
being sold at 2s. a yard, with no charge whatever
for making and laying; and various consignments
of rugs, blankets, boots, shoes, overcoats, water-
proofs, &c., <fec., are being sold at the same ruinous
rates. Also, the four winds which blow in the
halls of heaven continue to bring in orders from
everywhere for the famous £2 parcel, which in-
cludes a suit of clothes, two boiled shirts, two
under-shirts, six pairs of socks, two ties, two
collars, six handkerchiefs—no person with the
kind of cold which prevails just now can get
through with less than six—set of studs, hat, pair
braces and a pair of boots. The said orders, each
with remittance attached, now average 100 daily,
and many letters expressing the satisfaction of
the purchasers can be seen at the office. A large
consignment of misfits in every branch of clothing
and bought at merely nominal prices, has just
been received per Orotava, and Mr. Herman is
shortly starting for Europe to make contracts for
the purchase of all misfits from the leading tailors
of London, Glasgow, Liverpool, Paris, Vienna,
and other cities. When this arrangement is com-
pleted, he calculates that the business will be the
most extensive of its kind south of the line.
Meanwhile, an additional elevator is being put in
and the trade is already slopping over far beyond
the limits of the original premises, and Mr. Her-
man is concocting schemes for absorbing the whole
block from George-st. right down to York-st |

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
“ It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to toll you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger's Food.’ The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never be able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ Benger’s
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
M lf every mother knew of
its value no other would he
used."
“Religions die when they are
proved to be true.”—Oscar Wilde.
In a proclamation the Emperor of
China states that his policy henceforth
will be to support truth, to eradicate
abuses, and to stop bribery and corruption
in the public service. It sounds like an
Australian election-address.
(>ne day lately a group of people at
Gastlemaine (Vic.) were talking about
death. “I’d like to die suddenly when
my time comes,” one of them remarked,
and with that he fell forward and expired.
This is the sort of incident that the
average parson likes to descant upon just
before taking up the collection. If elo-
quently handled it helps the collection
materially. Most people have a vague,
unacknowledged idea that death can some-
how be guarded against by subscribing
liberally to the collection.
Premier Reid (N.S.W.) states that
he and Attorney - General Want are
stiongly opposed to local option without
compensation, while the rest of the Cabinet
supports it. Local option and compensa-
tion are just as urgent questions as Free-
trade. and Protect on, and if these two
supp r'ers of drink are prepaied to coale ce
with their opponents, what right have they
to throw bricks at the Dibbs-Parkes coali-
tion, which is just as immoral? What
is there to choose betwc en, the man who
sinks his 1< cal opti >n principles pro-
fessedly for the sake of Foreign-trade, and
the 01 e who sinks his fiscal principles pro-
fessedly for the sake of Federation?
Gladstone’s refusal to participate in a
public howl against Turkish atrocities sets one
thinking of the old time, when he published a
pamphlet on the same gruesome subject. Disraeli
was then the Turk’s champion and Gladstone his
bitterest foe. The aforesaid pamphlet, which
dealt with Bashi-Bazouk doings ip Bulgaria, had
an enormous sale, and Judy, the Tory “comic”
paper, cartooned the G.O.M. in the act of pump-
ing sovereigns from a “Bulgarian atrocities”
machine into a sack. Underneath the picture-—
“There is no truth in the rumor that Mr. Glad-
stone intends to donate the profits of his pamphlet
to the Bulgarian Relief Fund.’’ Another Tory
gibe at humanitarianism was expressed ina sketch
of a murderous-looking collier saying to his feeble
wife—“Get me pound o’steak and onions’gin I
come back from ’trocity meetin’, or I’ll knock thy
dom’d head off.”

Up East, after a recent murder, a lawyer’s

against him.” Dog does not eat dog ? Sometime^

When a boy, I used to ride a pony which would
never, at night, go down a certain lonely lane
where a man had been murdered ; and once, when
I forced him into it, he got into such a pitiable
state of terror that I let him turn back. I have

The constables connected with the Yic.
quarantine-station have a grievance that should
appeal to the most callous heart. New regula-
tions have recently been passed calling upon them
to report themselves for vaccination oftener than
hitherto, and they venture to object, remarking
that they have already been vaccinated in a
most intemperate and unreasonable manner—one
veteran, for instance, having the marks and
brands of no less than 40 “takes.” It is under-
stood that the officers do not object to being
vaccinated once all over, but when there is no
room left on their bodies for further scarifying,
and the doctors start to double-bank the brands,
there is going to be trouble. Thb Bulletin
sympathises with the constables : this excessive
vaccination is unnecessary, for, as Noah said,
Melbourne policemen rarely catch anything.

HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE
The Old Convict .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A “HARD CASE,” his back seamed with inglorious
soars, painted with a free hand, the work of the
“old masters”; thick grey hair like the fur on
the north-end of an old native bear; hard, cold,
steel-grey eyes looking furtively to right and left;
large ears that, in their intensity of listening,
moved forward and backward in obedience
to the muscles that have become useless in
the ordinary human being, like the third eyelid,
memento of our bird ancestors. His wrists,
wrinkled and hairy, bore the marks of the ancient
“bracelets,” and his ankles were furrowed by the
141 b. irons of the days when he would cheerfully
have cursed God and died. He walked as he bad
walked 60 years ago, leg-ironed on the shores of
Norfolk Island. By my subtlest diplomacy did I
obtain the confidence of that old man, made sp
sensitive and suspicious in the bitter experience of
the long-dead but unforgotten past. Now and
then, as the red-coated soldier, or the overseer, or
the flogger, drifted across the field of memory, the
hard, bony hands would clench, the grey eyes
flash an infernal fire, and the deep voice utter a
fearfully bitter —“ Curse them ! Curse them 1”
And yet in the inner nature of that man there
were noble qualities, green spots in the awful
desert, springs of living water in the thunder-
scarred granite of that human rock. His code of
honor was narrow, but inflexible. Friendship-
true, unselfish, willing to risk death if called upon;
and, on the other side, a hate pitiless, remorseless,
unscrupulous, compared to which the fury of a
tigress robbed of her young might be regarded as
compassionate.
He was in Port Arthur when the Lady
Franklin called in ’63 to take a band of “lifers ”
to Norfolk Island. He had been to the Island
before; landed there from the China with 300
others in ’45, from London. John Price was com-
mandant, and the red-coats were a part of the 11th
Regiment. The 300 from the China made up 2200
Prisoners. Capt. Willett stood on the deck of the
iady Franklin as the boats came off with the 25
lifers (first three years in irons) and swore that no
man should come on board unless naked as the day
he was born. So the 25 stripped and climbed over
the side. This was the usual closing of the door
after the steed had gone. Boat crews had been
off to the vessel with wood and water, and friendly
bands had taken concealed implements and
secreted them on board. The clothes were
handed up and the lifers were dressed on deck.
“ Eleven of them,” said the old man, “ were
awful scoundrels.” The sort of men deserving
that title from him would baffle the human
imagination to describe. Capt. Willett had a pre-
sentiment that this would be his last voyage,
hence his unusual precautions. Nine of the 25
joined the band of sworn conspirators, and of these
there were five who “jibbed ” at the last moment.
But the remaining four were men prepared to
do or die. During a squall, when the sailors were
aloft, and the captain in the cabin, they out a
hole ih the deck and the four men crawled along
through the lazarette into the cabin, and looked
out to see a soldier on the poop. They crept
softly up, caught him by surprise, and threw him
overboard Bill Davis, the ringleader, gave each
of the three a musket and bayonet, and told him
to use it if necessary. Then he “stalked" the
man at the helm and laid him out with a belaying-
pin. The four then covered the sentry below with
their muskets, and told him to hand up his
weapon “ butt upwards.” They forced the sentry
to tell the sergeant that “the ship was taken and
they were all prisoners, and to hand up the fire-
arms I” The sentry warned the sergeant not to
shoot. The sergeant did shoot, and shot nobody.
All the muskets and bayonets were handed up and
flung overboard. '■
Bill Davis ordered the sergeant up on deck and
told him to stand there, while he told a seaman,
just down from aloft, to bring the carpenter.
Davis then went and called through the bars :
“ Any of you Norfolk men who want to be in this
better come up 1” And they all came with a rush.
Then the carpenter had to strike the irons off all
the prisoners and put them on the captain, the
sergeant, and the 15 soldiers ! The captain fought
like a demon when being brought up from the
cabin. Fifteen soldiers’ wives were on board.
They were asked if they would stay on deck or go
below with their husbands. They preferred to
stay on deck. Not one of these women received
the slightest insult; on the contrary, they were
treated with the greatest politeness. All the
spirits were thrown overboard. The convicts
disabled the ship, and took to the boats, being
then about 104 miles from Levuka, where Bill
Davis, Joe Merry, and an Irish Cockney convict
were finally captured and taken to Sydney,
brought up at the police-court, and remanded to
Hobart Town. Oapt. Willett and the soldiers’
wives spoke highly of the consideration shown to
them when the ship was taken, and they got off
with six months in irons. “ Only six months for
mutiny and piracy, ” said the old man sadly,- “ and
I got 18 months in irons for absconding as assigned
servant from an old pensioner’s widow, Mrs.
Oleary, who kept a pub. called the ‘Connaught
Rangers! ’ ” And the old fellow nearly shed
tears at the recollection of so glaring an anomaly
in the awards of justice.
And here is how he escaped, and his subsequent
proceedings. He had a brother, a free man,
possessed of much coin, the magic “open sesame”
of so many locks and bars. This brother suc-
ceeded in getting him assigned to Mrs. Cleary,
who was one of the conspirators. “ Let him stop
here,” said the old lady, “ two captains are court-
ing my two girls, and I’ll get him away all right!”
But the brother had him removed to a pub. kept
by an “old hand,” and concealed there for six
weeks. To deceive the servants, he was repre-
sented as a martyr to acute rheumatism ; in fact,
one leg was completely paralysed. There was a
grim humor in the old fellow’s description of the
awful agonies he suffered from that imaginary
rheumatism, and the groans he uttered when one
of the servants even touched the unfortunate
limb. One day a visitor, dressed in great style,
drove up to the pub. in a cab. He was sent by
the brother. “Has Mr. Wright recovered from
his severe indisposition ?” The reply was that he
was “ too ill to move!” The visitor said he would
drive him down to the ship, where a cabin was
taken, with the intention of trying the effect of a
sea voyage ! “ Oh, Lord,” said the old chap, “to
think o’ me being carried into that cab, groanin’
like a dyin’ ’orse, when I could ha’ jumped over a
five-railed fence !” So he was driven down to the
shore, put into a boat and rowed off to a schooner
called the Freetrader, bound to Port Albert for a
cargo of bullocks.
He was followed by the gentleman who came in
tne cab. This imposing personage leaped on
board the Freetrader, and, walking up to “ Mr.
Wright,’’ shook hands with him effusively and
wished him a pleasant voyage.
It seems necessary here to remark that “Mr.
Wright,” the hero of this episode, was in great
demand by the authorities, and there were special
precautions to guard against him escaping by any
of the sea-going vessels.
“In them times I was a bit of a devil 1” said
the old man, modestly. This statement passed
entry in my credulity without any taxation what-
ever.
The swell, who drove to the hotel in a cab, saw
“Mr. Wright” off in the boat and then shook
hands with him on board the Freetrader, was the
official “searcher,” who boarded all vessels and
searched them for runaway convicts. He had
been judiciously interviewed by the “brother,”
the man with much coin ! Oh ! that we all had
similar brothers!
After one of the boatmen saw the searcher
shake hands with “Mr. Wright,” he touched his
hat and remarked, privately, “that’s the man
we’ve been looking for, sir !”
“The man be damned,” said the searcher,
“that’s an old friend of many years 1” (Dear
“ brother,” with thy puissant coin !)
Of course, the searcher acquitted the Freetrader
without a stain on her character. This searcher
was named John Smith. He was an ex-Manches-
ter pick pocket, who kept a grog-shop at Hobart.
So, “Mr. Wright” left by the Freetrader for
Port Albert. There was a fine humor in the old
fellow’s observation, “She was an old tub goin’
for a cargo o’ bullocks for the butchers. No
wonder I was the only first-class passenger I”
On arrival at Port Augusta the first man he met
had been a fellow-prisoner in the “Old Bailey.”
“Mr, Wright” landed in gorgeous raiment, swell
walking-suit, bell-topper, and Wellington boots
that cost ,£3 10s. The Old Bailey friend gave one
glance and observed “For God’s sake, Johnson,
don’t wear them togs here! Go and wring your-
self !” The latter remark was an Old Baileyism
for “ change your clothes.”
Johnson walked up to the hotel and ordered a
room. The landlord and the guests took him for
a disguised duke, or some capitalist come to buy
up all the neighboring stations.
Johnson sat down in a private parlor and rang
the bell. It was answered by the waiter, in whom
he at once recognised a man who had been hang-
man and flogger on Norfolk Island, and flogged
Johnson himself on one occasion. .
The waiter knew the visitor at a glance.
“ Hillo!” he said, “ain’t you out a little afore
your time ? ”
“ Bring me some brandy,” said Johnson, sternly
and contemptuously, for no flogger or hangman
was a special favorite in the penal settlements.
Johnson drank the brandy, walked into another
room, full of cattle-men, and shouted for all hands.
“Won’t you include the waiter?” “That ain’t
no waiter,” said Johnson, in the man’s presence,
“that’s White, the hangman from Norfolk Island,
the fellow who hanged ‘ Jackey Jackey ’ and 11
other men in one mornin’ !”
This damaging testimonial was regarded by the
waiter as good enough to travel on, and he left
that night without even saying good-bye.
Johnson also decided that there might be more
congenial localities even for himself, and started
overland to Port Phillip on foot, wearing the
Wellington boots, which were not removed until
cut off his swollen feet, with a razor, in the
Clarence hotel, in Melbourne.
The old fellow still retains some of his primeval
robustness, and his taste for beer and rum is in no
way affected by time and trouble.

A Dream of God .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I saw the awful oountenanoe of God
Distorted with a nameless agony
Keener than Christ’s, when, ’neath the olive tree,
His bloody sweat bedewed the sacred sod.
Silent and helpless as a carven clod —
Racked with a fierce remorse He seemed to be,
The countless wrongs of an Eternity
Scourging Him with His own avenging rod.
All vestige of His Deity was flown
Save immortality, which, hour by hour,
Shot sharper pangs through every quickened sense
As, dreaming of His former pride and power,
He sat upon the ruins of a throne,
Abject, despoiled by His Omnipotence.

MAROUS.
According to private letters, the most
flourishing industry at Southern Cross (\SjjA.) is
coffin-making. The Govt, hospital and the hos-
pital founded by the Wesleyan Church (move-
ment initiated in Melbourne) are crowded with
typhoid patients.
Dear Bulletin, —A N.S.W. Attorney-
General has appeared to prosecute in person at
Sydney Criminal Court since Wisdom prosecuted
Dunn 15 years ago. W. B. Dailey, when A.G.,
appeared in person about ’B7 to prosecute in a case
of highway robbery committed on the Liverpool
Road. The case was one of modified bushrang-
ing, and, if I remember rightly, the person robbed
was the pay-clerk of Monie and Co., the contrac-
tors for one of the Sydney Water Supply con-
tracts. —Paolo Maoaui.
The Adelaide Hospital squabble, after pro-
viding the “ holy ” oity with diluted scandal for
weeks, has ended in the nurses who raised the
storm backing down, apologising for the naUghty
things they said about the management, and ask-
ing to be reinstated. But the fun isn’t all over.
The members of the board are wroth because the
Hospital Commission recommended the retirement
of two of their number in order to make room for
a couple of lady “ boarders.”
A man named Smith, while walking along
a country road near Oooma(N.S.W.), abstractedly
put his lighted pipe in the same pocket with 24
boxes of matches. Presently the matches flared
up, and burned everything off him save his boots
and his collar. A few hours later a charred object,
which was almost too indefinite to be called Smith
or anything else, expired in the local hospital.

Dear Bulletin,—-Although, as you say,
there should be no regiments but “ Australian,”
there are excuses for the “ Sydney Scottish ”
which wouldn’t apply to the Cardinal's “ Faugh-
a-ballaghs.” Irish national sentiment is hyper-
sensitive, irascible, aggressive; Scottish ditto is
placid, good-humored, defensive. The Caledonian,
like the Hibernian, thinks himself the apex of
humanity, but he isn’t so ferociously resentful of
scepticism on the point. The Scot, in fact, is
much the less “scotty.” And, in any case, the
raison d’Stre of the Scottish Rifles is not so much
the nationality as the rig-out. Take away the
kilt, and you take away the label I—Bbebks.

JIM .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was an. illogical, irrelevant sort of a man—
inconsistent, of course, but not merely inconsis-
tent. That would be ordinary. Jim never failed
to carry his inconsistency to the pitch of unneces-
sary unreason.
We were mates in ’B4, and had bottomed five
holes without luck. We were at work on the
sixth ; and funds were nearly exhausted.
Another day’s work would decide our fortune,
and we sat outside the tent in the dusk and specu-
lated on probabilities. Jim seemed more than
ordinarily* sanguine ; while I felt anxious—for if
no luck this time, what next?
I lowered him down the shaft next morning,
and he worked for two whole hours, and then
came up for a few minutes’ blow. He said he
thought we were close on it—talked of the trips
we would have together to Melbourne, Sydney,
Tasmania —anywhere and everywhere. Then he
went below again and worked for another hour —I
meanwhile grafting steadily at the windlass.
, Bresently came a short spell on his part, and a
consequent cessation of windlass work. I sat on
the handle in the sun and built imaginative palaces
of delight until called back to stern reality by his
call—“ Haul up !”
I wound away at the windlass with blissful
energy—for surely his voice had a ring of gladness
in it—and when the coils of rope on the barrel
told me he was near the top, I called out “At
last, Jim 1”
He did not answer, so I peered down the shaft
as I wound him up. . . . My God ! what was
this ! He was on the rope, it was true, but from
his upturned, quivering face, the starting, glaring
eyeballs seemed to shoot through me.
The windlass refused to turn : I strained and
strained until he came clear of the shaft, and then,
horror-stricken and panting with fear, looked, as
I held the handle against my chest.
Jim had fastened the rope round his neck : I
had hauled up a strangled man.
We had bottomed on another duffer.
D.M.
Madame Blavatsky’s friends, in contradict'
ing the charges of immorality reiterated against
her, point out that “indisputable evidence ” fore d
the N.Y. Sun to withdraw similar charges.
“ That evidence was a medical certificate that
Madame Blavatsky was a physical ascetic.” Neat.
In Melb. Criminal Court, the other day,
a woman appealed for mercy on the ground that
she was soon to be a mother. The sympathetic
jury found her not guilty, and the woman laughed
openly. Judge Holroyd said he understood quite
well that she laughed because she thought she had
duped the jury. And hadn’t she?
The policy, economical and otherwise, of
introducing third-class carriages on N.S.W. rail-
ways gives the board of two a topic for animated
discussion. The Bulletin wonders who is at
the bottom of the third-class idea, which has
nothing whatever to recommend it. To create
a third-class would involve a very expensive
alteration of rolling-stock, and of all the depart-
mental machinery; and where is the profit to
come from? Three classes have had a long trial
in England, and only one or two companies now
maintain them, the others running first and third
only, or first and second only.

There's a whisper from the regions out beyond the
Barwon banks,
There’s a gathering of the legions and a forming
of the ranks,
There’s a murmur coming nearer with the signs
that never fail,
And it’s time for every shearer to be out upon the
trail;
They must leave their girls behind them and their
empty glasses, too,
For there’s plenty left to mind them when they
cross the dry Barooo :
There’ll be kissing, there’ll be sorrow such as only
sweethearts know,
But before the noon to-morrow they’ll be singing
as they go;
For the Western creeks are calling,
And the idle days are done,
With the snowy fleeces falling,
And the Queensland sheds begun.
There is shortening of the bridle, there is tighten-
ing of the girth,
There is fondling of the idol that they love the
best on earth,
Northward from the Lachlan River and the sun-
dried Oastlereagh, _
Outward to the Never-Never ride the “ringers”
on their way.
From the green bends of the Murray they have
run their horses in,
For there’s haste and there is hurry when the
Queensland sheds begin ;
On the Bogan they are bridling, they are saddling
There is plunging and there’s sidling -for the colts
don t understand
That the Western creeks are calling,
And the idle days are done,
With the snowy fleeces falling,
And the Queensland sheds begun.

to strap the pack,
For there’s never license given to the laggards on

Do you hear the rush and rattle as they tramp

Mudgee Western Post of 10th May pub-

beginning : “ When we two parted in silence and

They’ll soon be printing the Lord’s Prayer as an

The S.M. Herald complains, and with
justice, that the absence of a tea-duty has led to
the N.S. W. market being flooded with a cheap
and utterly villainous description of Chinese tea.
The same paper also complains that the presence
of a heavy duty on spirits leads to bad liquor
being put on the market. Also, though the want
of a duty leads to shoddy tea, the Hekald flatly
• Inclines to see that the want of other duties will
lead to other kinds of imported shoddy. Some-
thing has gone askew with the old paper’s logic.
The present predicament of Oscar Wilde
is not the first difficulty in which the family
has been concerned. In ’62, the late Sir William
Wilde, “ surgeon oculist to the Queen in Ireland,”
was defendant in a sensational action for “as-
sault,” brought by a Miss Travis, who gained
some literary repute under the pen-name of
“Francis Boyle Price.” This lady was “like
one of the family ” at the Wilde mansion in
Merrion Square, the most fashionable part of
Dublin in those days, and now. But at length
“Speranza” began to regard her with distrust,
and a social earthquake took place when Miss
Travis openly charged Sir William with a heinous
crime. She did not take vulgar criminal proceed-
ings, but brought a civil action for damages, and
employed, as leading counsel, the most brilliant
man then at the Irish bar —Isaac Butt, Q.O. Her
case was, that one day she was in Sir William
Wilde’s surgery, that he placed her under chloro-
form But the ooulist emerged safely
from the scrape.

Chamberlain, whose brilliance has ex-

for their leadership, seriously damaged his chances
theotherday bysaying that Welsh Church disestab-
lishment is bound to come, and if the clergy are
wise they will make terms at once, instead of
waiting till no terms but unconditional surrender
are open. As the Conservatives rely largely on
the aid of tho olerioal party fct su ' coeB8 g at y
approaching elections, this gratuitous insult— for
so it was rbgarde d-from a quasi-Conservative
leader was a typical bombshell in the Tory oaitm
while the Liberals naturally exulted. Chamber:
lain, however, uninfluenced by the storm of Torv
threats and repr oaohes, has since helped to pass the
Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill through the
Commons by 44 majority. This significant vote
widens still further the division between Josenh
