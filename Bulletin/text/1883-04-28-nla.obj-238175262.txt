New Guinea Annexation.
The annexation of New Guinea by the Queens-
land Premier is certainly the most remarkable
event which has occurred on this aide of the
equator during the last score of years, if the war
between Chili and Peru be excepted. Sir Thomas
M'llwkaith has created a precedent for himself,
a course which is said to be an attribute of great
men. Never before has the Premier of a depen-
dency assumed a title to annex. That has been
an exercise of dominion which even Imperial
authority has used with hesitation. Sir Thomas
has coolly forced the hand of Mr. Gladstone. A
weaker man would have commenced to work up
an agitation ; would have moved his local legisla-
ture to vote solemn addresses to the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, and would have supplicated
the Governments of the other colonies to lend,
by similar addresses, their moral support to his
project. By this plan the whole affair would
have dragged on for years. The Imperial Minister
would have a hundred other things to occupy his
attention, and would have been little inclined to
run his party into any risk, such as a re-
opening of the much-vexed question of annexa-
tion would have exposed it to, in the
Parliament of Great Britain. It is well known
that the Manchester school of politicians regard
further acquisitions of territory by Groat Britain
with strong disfavour, and that party is potent in
Mr. Gladstone’s Cabinet. The only likely result
of a movement so conducted would have been to
advertise Now Guinea as “ unclaimed property,”
and to stir up soma foreign Power to take advan-
tage of the delays and vacillations of the British
Government. Had such a course been pursued,
it would in all likelihood have been the Italian,
the Dutch, or the German flag which would hive
been the first to wave over New Guinea in token
of annexation.
• • •
But Sir Thomas M'llwkaith has spoken face
to face witd Secretaries of State, and P is an open
secret that familiarity has had to his mind its pro-
verbial effect. He was not smitten with awe-

Rcuiua w n 91810n > an d dexterity which belong to
the feat u ro , n °t prepared lightly to admit that
P°Pnlar ona J )9e . n , a desirable one. That it is a
°f our o»n „,? UBt con coded. The Governments
halia, have J-fu' ol and of South Aus-
picate entk„ • a P r °mptitudo which seems to
siasm, ofiicially endorsed with their
approval the remarkable proceeding of the Queens-
land Premier. The appropriation of New Guinea
is probably as popular among the people of Aus-
tralia as it is with the Governments. It tickles
the national self-esteem. And in a modified degree
the people of Great Britain are likely to be simi-
larly affected.
• « •
There is little likelihood, therefore, that what has
been done will be undone. The politicians of the
eld country are, judging by the tenor of cable
advices, considerably staggered by the masterful
fashion in which the Premier of a mere depen-
dency has committed the Empire to a step un-
authorised and scarcely premeditated by them. It
is more than likely that they may feel somewhat
affronted to have been tied to Sir Thomas
MTlwraitii’s chariot-wheels in the peremptory
fashion he has adopted. But they must feel that
they have been cornered. To haul down
the flag which has been so demonstratively
hoisted, would involve a necessity for de-
claring in the face of the world a policy
which might have in the future large and
very inconvenient consequences. Such a course
would be equivalent to a declaration that the
Empire had reached its limits, and that the days
of territorial acquisition are gone by for ever.
To arrive at such a decision would demand quite
as much deliberation as would have been required
for concluding to authorise the annexation, had it
been urged in the ordinary tedious fashion.
Moreover, the expressions of chagrin and dis-
appointment which the announcement of the
annexation, by Queensland on behalf of Great
Britain, have elicited from Italy and other Powers,
afford evidence that the lowering of the Union
Jack from its flagstaff in New Guinea would be
but the signal tor the hoisting of the Italian or
other ensign. The most probable outcome of
the mortification and resentment of Imperial
Ministers at being tricked into playing the game
of a Colonial Premier, will be that a course
already hinted at in the cablegrams will be at-
tempted, The flag hoisted by order of Sir Thomas
M'llwkaith will not bo hauled down, but a slap
in the face will bo administered to that too froward
Colonial, by constituting New Guinea a Crown
colony, and thus removing it from" the manage-
ment and control of the too audacious Australian
But even if this course be attempted, it is ques-
tionable whether it can be successfully carried
out. Sir Thomas M’llwbaith does not generally
load off in a game of this kind, unless he holds a
strong hand, and has trump cards in r<a«rvo. He
is quite capable of claiming to hold rigour
of the Constitutional game, and of restating in a
legitimate, but none the less effectual, way any
attempt to snatch from him the stakes for which
he has played.
• • •
Still, granting all this, the character of his feat
remains to be considered. The responsibility of
appropriating and colonising so vast a territory aa
Southern New Guinea, is enormous. The country
is no unpeopled waste. It is populated pretty
thickly by anativerace of singular characteristics,
who will have to be dealt witu. The contact
between these aborigines and white settlers will
be precipitated by the annexation, and. a mutual
modus vivendi will have to be discovered and
reduced to practice. ’I he moral sense of the
British people is too highly cultivated now-adaya
for former methods to be tolerated. The rifle will
not be admissible to solve the problem off-hand.
The difficulties ahead are enormous, and he would
be a sanguine man who would pretend to predict
the precise forms which these difficulties <pll take.
• • •
When one looks around for justification of the
Queensland Premier’s action, there is considerable
embarrassment. The Earl of Debby has officially
declared that Her Majesty’s Government have no
information leading them to believe that any
foreign Power contemplated stealing a march on
Great Britain and anticipating our own country in
the annexation just accomplished. Still, it was
always possible that Italy, Germany, Holland, or
oven Spain might have produced a M'llwkaith
at any moment, and that New Guinea might have
suddenly been appropriated as an appendage of
any one of these countries. Holland has already
assumed possession of the Northern half of the
island. The Dutch might have formally appro-
priated the other half at a day s notice. Spain is
close at hand, in the Philippines.
* * •
The question has therefore to be considered
whether it would have been desirable, or even
tolerable, that any of these Nations should have
established a colony in the immediate ne'ghbour-
hood of the Australian continent? National sen-
timent will answer in the negative. But national
sentiment is not necessarily reason. The vicinity
cf a settlement of any other European people
would have its advantages as well as its dis-
advantages. The Dutch, for instance, are good
neighbours, and export managers of native races.
But, on the other hand, the example originally sot
by England in Australia itself of inaugurating
settlement by the creation of a penal establish-
ment has been imitated on several occasions, and
might be repeated in New Guinea. This, as the
case of New Caledonia has taught us, would have
been a real injury to ns. And this furnishes the
most potent argument in favour of annexation.
To the contention that it would never do to permit
a foreign Power to effect a lodgment so near our
settlement, we attach no importance whatever.
We must have neighooura on some side, far or
near, unless it be conceived that it is the mission
and destiny of Britons to annex the whole globe.
And if it be desirable to be separated from
neighbours as widely as possible, it is a prepos-
terous thing to cross the Straits and plant our-
selves alongside of them, as has been done by
annexing half of an island of whioh the remainder
is already held by a foreign Power. We do not
thus widen the interval —we narrow it; we abolish
it altogether. In lieu of remaining secluded in a
saa-girt continent, we advance till merely an
imaginary political line constitutes our frontier.
Politically regarded, therefore, the annexation of
New Guinea seems a mistake. It remains to bo
seen whether commercial considerations constitute
a sufficient justification.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Sapping with the Devil.
A Mr. Vidal has been supping with the Devil, without
the precaution of using a long spoon. In other words,
he has gone to law with his lawyer. As a matter of
course, he has burnt his fingers. Vidal’s sad story is
that, having to defend a slander case, he employed Mr.
J. M. Curtis, solicitor, of Sydney, to advise him, Mr.
Curtis took counsel’s opinion—Mr. Simpson’s —and,
according to Vidal, counsel advised him to defend,
stating that it Vidal could prove what he stated, he
would win. So Curtis engaged f isiPSON-nt a fee of 30
guineas, and all was joy. But when the caro was about
to come on at Qoulburn, the learned counsel ascer-
tained that he had been grossly insulted The other
tide had given Pilcher 40 guineas ! On learn,
iug of th;s outrage, Mr. Simpson, barrister, poured his
woes into the sympathetic ear of Mr Curtis, solicitor,
and suggested that their joint client should pay ten
guineas more. Mr. Curtis, solicitor, promptly recog-
nised the justice, or legality, or precedent, or some-
thing, of the client whose interests he had undertaken
to protect being induced to pay ten guineas to Mr.
Simpson, the barrister, because his antagonist had
paid ten; and he alleged that when he laid the matter
before Vidal, the latter agreed to give the extra £loloa.
Vidal, however, viewed the occurrence differently.
His version is that it was inconceivable that he would
be such a fool, such a perfect idiot, as to consent to
give Mr. Simpson, or anyone else in any capacity what-
ever, ton guineas more than ho wanted, after tolling
him (Vidal) when the case was first submitted to him
that if he could prove what be had stated he would win,
and then when he had got up to Qoulburn and secured
his fee turning round and telling him he had not a log to
stand upon, and that the more he proved his case the
more he would put himself into it. All that ho
had agreed to, was to pay the extra ten guineas
provided Mr. Simpson won the case. But Mr.
Simpson lost the case. Vidal asseried that he had
arranged to pay expenses in cash as he went along, so
that there should bo no bill. Curtis now denied this,
and sued Vidal for £64 ss. lid, over and above £79 10s.
received during the progress of the litigation. Accord,
iug to Vidal, he didn’t get this supplementary bill till
thirteen months after the whole affair had been ter-
minated, and after he had transferred his affairs to tho
care of another lawyer. He conducted his own defence
against Curtis’ claim, and made it pretty lively for
lawyers generally. “What,” he asked, “was the
lawy ers’ whole profession hat to deceive the public
with their eyes open, and make yon believe black was
white and white was no colour at all ?” This inquiry
shocked his Honor the lawyer on the Bunch. “I cannot,”
said His Honor Judge Macfablane, “allow you to go
on this way, you are going beyond all bounds." But Vidal
was not to be snuffed out by any lawyer. “It was to
euchre the lawyers that he had not this time obtained
professional assistance. He had bled enough already.
They had urged him to fight out the case, and then,
afeer spending £3OO in law, they advise him to mpko an
apology, which he could have done at first by paying
Mr. Davidson a guinea.” And then he displayed to
the jury a picture of two lawyers milking a cow, while
rival clients pull at her by horns and tail. And having
likened himself to a cow, Mr. Vidal was shoved into
the bail. The jury gave Mr. Curtis a verdict for the
amount he claimed. We need hardly mention that iij
was a jury of four.

EXTEAOai) KART CURE OF CANCER IN THE
EAR BY UK. STaNICH.
Dear Sir, —I have pleasure in bearing testimony to the
great reliet you hive given me by curing me of a cancer
in the right ear, and I think my case should bo made
known to the general public of this great city and
colony. My testimony is as follows -.—When 1 was
about 14 years of age an insect got into my right ear,
and I suffered severely from the pain caused so as to
nearly drive me out of my sensss In order to obtain
relief, I went to the Eye and Ear Infirmary, at Liver-
pool, England, but did not succeed in obtaining rel ef I
was m need of, and I continued to suffer from excruci-
ating pains in tbo head and ear for a period of three
years, about which time the insect came out dead,
leaving a discharge from the ear, which at length be-
came so offensive to all with whom I came in contact
that it made iay lota most miserable one indeed. Ac-
companied with the discharge were severe pains iir the
head. I went to several doctors, but could get no relief
Their invariable remedy was to sjring's the ear with
lotions which they proscribed I wont to New Zealand,
and became a patient in the Dunedin Hospital, Whilst
there 1 was in a state bordering upon insanity, caused
by the diseased ear affecting tho brain, aid was advised
after being there th> eo weeks to go to Sydney, where it
was said the climate, being warmer, would be better
for my complaint. I , however, got worse, until at
length a canoor was i o be seen protruding from my ear.
I consulted a doctor of repute here, who put me under
an operation, which laid me up for several dayp, but
still tho cancer grew. I gave myself up to despair of
ever being curse, until one day I readot the wonderful
euro effected through your instrumentality upon the
Governor of this colony. That encouraged mo to make
another tlfort. I waited upon you and explained my
case, and without any hesitation you psr formed a most
successful operation by removing the cancer entirely
from my ear, and within 10 minutes of the operation
being performed I experienced the greatest relief that I
bad experienced for tho last 16 year*. All that giddi-
ness, loss of energy, and languid feeling is gone; and,
thank Providence, I can ascribe this snooessinl cure to
your skilful treatment of my complaint.
Yon can make whatever use you like of this, public
or otherwise.—Yours, &o ,

Criminal Appeal.
The information recently cabled of the second reading
in the House of Commons of a Bill to provide for the
establishment of an Appeal Court for criminal cases
indicates a new and wide departure from the ancient
canons of English law. Theoretically, of course, the
right of an accused person to appeal baa been recog-
nised, but, in practice, that recognition has bean
narrowed down to a review of the evidence taken at the
trial in a superior court, of the Judge's direction to the |
jury, and the verdict as affected hy these two influences
This review takes place in the Supreme Court, and onij
upon certain points, which, being doubtful in them-
selves, have made the Judge's direction to
the jury contain either bad law or a mis-
statement of fact, which points ara reserved
for the consideration of Bull Court. It is"
almost superfluous to remark, for everyone who pay
any attention to the operation of the laws must have
noticed, that this review takes place in extremely few
cases Of course, it is ea*y to see that the right of
appeal, as now given in civil cases, would be a trouble-
some business if allowed equally in criminal cases
However, the wonder is that so many years should
have passed hy before it was thought advisable to es,
tablish a Special Cour£ of Appeal, wherein all matters
of doubt arising in the trial of prisoners might bo
determined, and especially where questions of fact, as
distinct from questions of law, might be proved and
equitably decided. Laymen not less than lawyers will
look with interest at this Biß, and especially to see by
what means the right of appeal will bo granted, with-
out incurring the risk of giving criminals a second
chance of escape.
The Licensing Blockade.
The Legislative Assembly has been subjected to an 1
outbreak of senselessness and imbecility. Whenever
the question of restrictive legislation dealing with the
liquor traffic has to bo considered, a number of people
take leave of their senses and exhibit symptoms of a
moral intoxication scarcely less distressing than in-
toxication duo to imbibition. Vested interests on the
one hand and overstrained fanaticism on the other,
struggling for victory, push common sense to one side.
The cause of temperance has hosts of advocates. We
believe that were a plebiscite taken to-morrow through-
out the colony, on the question of regulating the liquor
traffic in such a fashion as to wi hdraw undue tempta-
tion to drink to excess from the public, an overwhelm-
ing majority would decide for regulaiion. No decent
or reasonable man, not directly interested in the
sale of liquor, desires- to see grog-shops at every
street corner, and allurements to the cultiva* ion
of habits of inebriety tempting men at every turn.
But, on the other hand, reflective persons recog-
nise that there is a limit to the value of restrictive
legislation. If it were bo'ieved that absolute prohibi-
tion would rid the country of drunkenness a permhsivo
law would have been carried long ago. But by a host
of temperate people it is perceived that prohibition is
an empirical remedy, and that the roots of iutemper-
auco lie too deep and have ramifications too wide to be
extirpated by a single drastic proscription. It is noted
that drunkenness learaadistinctratiotosocial position,
and that although the exceptions are stri king on account
of their very rarity and the prominence which the posi-
tion of offenders lends te them, the proportion of drunk-
ards is greater the lower (ho social status of a class
This fact should bo taken into consideration by pro-
hibitionists, and should induce them to consider whet her
drinking habits can really be eliminated by anything
short of an advance in the general social condition of
the people. If this were recognised, much energy, en-
thusiasm, and devotion, which arc now wasted by mis.
direo‘iou, would be made available in mare effective
applications. Is has really been pitiful to observe
genuine aspirations for tbo welfare cf the community
perverted into ridiculous obstructive css, ns has
occurred in the Legislative Assembly during the
past week. The advocates of temperance have been
made the laugting-stock of the colony by the
mere trick of a reductio ad adaurdum. Jeering
opponents have hit upon the expedient of giving them
rope enough, and they bare forthwith hanged them,
selves. The farce of requiring a traveller to have
journeyed 500 miles before being entitled to bo served
with a drop of beer or grog, simply provokes the deri-
sion and antagonism of level-headed temperance men
The intrusion of Pabbattariau whims into a question
certainly quite foreign from dogmatic notions, raises up
as adversaries a large class which otherwise are good
friends to temperance. The teetotallers in the Assem-
bly have repeated the tolly of the dog which abandoned
bis bone to plunge after a shadow. The restrictions
they might have maintained will inevitably be lost to
them, either by amendment of the Licensing Act in the
Council, or by the Bill being laid aside altogether. For
those addle-pa'ed bigots we liava only contempt. For
the community which prefers thorn as representatives
to level-headed men who would suit their reforms to
the growth of temperance ideas among the community,
it is difficult to allow even pity,
r i he arbitrary powers enjoyed by tka Judges in this
colony to punish peop'e for that vague offence, “Con.
tempt of Court,” are relics of the bad old days when
ancestors oven cf some very distinguished persons
wore leg-irons. As matters at present stand, any judge
can order any man to ha put on his trial charged with
contempt, and without hearing, evidence, or allowing
the interposition of a jury, sentence his antagonist to
an unlimited tine or to imprisonment during his own
pleasure. There is no limit save such as consideration
for his own billet, and fear of popular indignation, im-
poses. Even in England—nay, even in Jreland-—such
uuqualitled power is not conceded to judges, And the
Lord Chancellor has ju-st introduced a bill to still fur-
ther restrain the power of a despotic or vindictive
judge. Early in last mouth, in tbe House of Lords
such a bill was read a first time. Undtr this measure
it is propesed to limit imprisonment for contempt in
the first instance to three mouths, and if the person
was still in contempt then a further term cf three
months, and further terras of three months so long as
the prisoner should be in contempt. A Bill of this kind
is infinitely more required in Now South Wales; and
we understand that if the Government do not iptro-
dnee one next session, the duty will be undertaken by a
private member.

Old J. J. Westwood, the distinguished rival of
tho only Pater Campbell in tho Bush Missionary dodge,
has given Australia best for a spall, and is touring Hew
Zoalatd, oa his Great Pyramid end Anglo Israel
racket. Westwood is a jolly old boy. if you know how
to take him. His special *• wsnity ”is h •.rse-flesb, and
when in luck he generally managed to have a couple of
good nags. The old obap walked into a newspaper
effije in a Queensland country town a few yenrj eg'',
and opened nco as n*ual with a Hank shot abcu‘. an ad-
vertisement bo wanted to insert. Now, to a country
newspnpjr man a cash •* ad.” is a bait that never fails.
So the ice was broken at once; Westwood was invred
to the sanctum, and smiled upon. And then he gradu-
ally unmasked his batteries Of course he had learned
the measure of his man before he presented himself,
and in this case he know tfce piety sue fill wasn’t good
for much. Po ho infused a good spice of tto jolly
beggar into his habitual whine. Ho produced tn inch
advertisement and fumbled for coin in his pocket. T,ho
newspaper fellow followed this move with a heathenish
interest. Westwood writhingly produced tbohalf-bull,
and remarked casually that ho met with many singular
experiences in his “mission.” At some stations he was
received as an Ambassador from on High, entertained
in the house, refreshed, comforted, and sent on his way
rejoining; yoa, with money in his purse. At others, he
was curtly d rented to tato his sway to “the huts,”
and hobble his horses outside tbo paddock. Even news-
paper men, continued tho Reverend gentleman, adroitly
gliding to the matter iu hand, varied greatly. Some
charged for his advertisements; soma didn’t; some
oven contributed to his mission. “It was just as the
Lord moved them.” The newspaper fellow grinned
horribly, and intimated by a gesture that ihe Lord
moved him to clutch that half-crowns Was Westwood
jut out of countenance ? We should smile. Five
minutes later a genial man of the world with a haughty
Roman nose, and patriarchal flowing long white hair,
was showing olf to a newspaper man the paces of a vs ry
neat hackney.

KSI LOUIS,WO
Extract from tlie Continental Gazette,
Paris.
The most surprising triumph for an American product
at tho Paris Exhibition was the success of E. Anheuser
& Co.’s Brewing Association of St. Louis, which
eclipsed Baas, Barclay and Perkins, Alsop H Guinness,
tho world-renowned English brewers, as well as hun-
dreda of rivals f:om Austria aud Bavaria. It ia not
surprising that a great sensation was produced when it
was understood that the experts reluctantly pro.
nounced tho St. Louis beer “ superior to any malt
liquor ever drank upon the continent,” and that all
Paris is now seeking to quaff the American neotar.
Sold by all First-class Hotels throughout Australia
and New Zealand.

Ttamala, Sara Bernhardt’s hubby, has an-
nounced that he " intends immediately to resume the
pcofes 3 * 011 of arms.” Whose arms, now, we wonder ?
The author of the paragraph with respect to an
•lowment, f or publishing which Lord Lonsdale is
criminally prosecuting Edmond Yates, of the World,
f, i a dy of high rank She has written to the solicitors
for the prosecution, apologising.
An old woman at Eoclefeohan, speaking of the
Carlyl o family, who were born there, explained that
•‘Jock was not a bad fellow," and * Jamie took more
niw into the market than any other farmer,” and then
add«d: “There was Tam, too j a useless moonstruck
chap that writes in London. There’s naething in
Tanil" *
In the Express account of tho presentation to
Archbishop Vaughan, the name of * Sir John Hughes ”
occurs immediately after that of Sir Patrick Jennings.
A 3 there may be ©re or two people who have never be-
fore heard cf Sir John aforesaid, wa may explain that
ju is an old gentleman (a long-retired grocer, in fact)
who has been knighted—by the Pope,
Archbishop Vaughan, who left by the 'Frisco
mail steamer, was “ seen off " by a huge assemblage of
the faithful. There were steamers and bands galore,
snd one of tho bands played ‘‘appropriate tunes”—
*uch as “ The girl I left behind me." This air was bod
enough, bit what will people say when wo whisper that
it was toottled in oonj auction with “Home Sweet
Home?”
In Mr. Stirling Crawfurd, the turf has lost one
ef its most princely patrons. For 37 years, he was a
plucky, liberal, and honest runner of racehorses, with
more than the average share of bad luck. Yet he raced
on a Monte-Christo scale, and no disappointments ever
made him dream of retiring Daring his long career,
however, he has, we believe, won every '• classic"
race at some time; of late, the “all-scarlet" has been
very successful; and, last year, it had a blaze of
triumph, winning over £25 000 In stakes alone. It was
only after 30 years’ devotion to tho turf he won the
coveted blue ribbon. Mr. Crawfard was a very heavy
better, yet an honest man, for he was rioh enough to be
indifferent to money.
King Jackey Jackey, of Benayo, S.A., who has
no subjects, and whoso possessions consist solely of tho
orthodox brass plate, is now in Narraooorte hospital, and
nhout to undergo a serious operation for hydatids. His
Majesty is about 63 years of age, and tho only survivor
of his tribe. A dispute at one time arose between a
powerful tribe in the Wircraera and King Jackey’s sub-
jicts. The former, foaling they were not equal to an
open fight, came down like wolves in the night, and
slaughtered everyone—men, women, and children—of
tho ficnayeoitea, except Jackey, who, being only about
four years of ago, escaped from his enemies’ ferocity by
hiding himself in a hollow log The Governor of the
colony, the other day, visited Jackey at the hospital.
“ Tho Claimant ” was visited in Portsmouth
Owl, last month, and found to be in good spirits in oou-
sequence of news that Charles Orton had recognised in
Cress well, now in Parramatta iaylum, hia brother Arthur
Ortou. The Claimant is thankful for small mercies.
Charles Orton may be perfectly sincere, yet hia
oath is worth about as much as that of Carey.
It was Chsries Orton who swore that the Claim-
ant himsolf is Arthur Orton, for which oath he
is now receiving £1 per week from tho Tiohberne
family and £1 per weak from the Crown. And now bo
is travelling, and living at the cost of those who believe
the Ciaimaat to be Roger Tichborne, and is perfectly
willing to swear that Croiswe 1 is his brother.
Captain Carey, in whose company tho Prince
Imperial was when the Zulus killed him, has died sud-
denly of heart disease at Kurraohoe, India, Carey was
accused of cowardice—it was alleged that he deserted
the Prince at tho critical moment to save kis own life.
Now, the rule of a reconnaissance >s sauve qai peat, and
Urey b Ufa was just as good and as valuable as that of
the Princei Imperial. The unfortunate Carey was
tainted with cowardice by a lot of toadies, who con.
a; bred that young Napoleon was made of special extra
quality clay. Anyhow, the charge of cowardice was
irwer sheeted hoae to Caroy; and oven if ho had boon
court-marhalled and found guilty, it is questionable
w&athjr the finding would have bean just, in view of tho
ran, that he possibly then suffered from the disease
whioh his now killed him.

es were few in these days, and
carnage of goods very intermittent. There is a tradition
among the older inhabitants that on more than one
occasion the late Mrs. Thorne trudged the whole dis-
tance, carrying a keg of rum on her head. One of he*
daughters, a most amiable and elegant woman, long a
leader in Queensland society, was born under a bullook
dray, on the track between Brisbane and Ipswich. By
and byo, nobblers at a shilling and needles at sixpence
each led to acquisitions of station property, town lots,
ifco., and by degrees a largo estate was accumulated. Mr.
'I home died several years ago, and now his faithful
hard-working partner has followed him. The pair had
a numerous family. Two sons died while quite young
men. The eldest son, George, was for a short time, by
a political accident. Premier of Queensland. The
several daughters married weH. During her latter
years, subsequent to the death of her husband, Mrs
Thorne seldom left her own house, and few, outside her
own family, except among the oldest residents, and the
poor, to whom she was always kind, will miss her.
The late Sir Joshua Peter Bell, president of the
Legislative Council of Queensland, was a very fine
follow. He was handsome and good-looking, but these
were the least among his good qualities. Ho was a big
squatter, his runs, Jimbour and Cutnkillerbar, being
among the largest and best in Queensland. Being fine
country and accessible, these runs were early out in
upon by selectors. But no animosity between Bell and
the selectors ensued. The squatter was the invader’s
best and most thoughtful friend. He was always ready,
of course, to buy them out. But many of them must have
succumbed but for his frieudly help. We remember
one incident, which is but a specimen of Bell’s dealings
He was riding through a let of selections on what had
been a choice part of his run, and dismounted t« have a
yarn with one of the settlers. Being invited, he en-
tered the hut and had a kindly word for the wife whose
baby lay in a cradle near the door. The selector pre-
sently led up a fine draught horse, and asked Mr. Bell
u he would buy it. “ But, hang it, man. that’s the
horse you do your ploughing with, isn’t it ? The only
only one you have too. What do you want to sell him
for r" The selector explained that it was not a matter
of choice but of necessity, and pressed Bell to buy.
After a moment's thought, Bell agreed to give the price
asked, and role to go, stooping over the cradle to pat
the baby as he passed. When Bell was mounted, the
poor devil of a selector led up the draught horse, hal-
tered, and asked if B*ll would lead him away er send
for him. “0, I'll send for him," said Bel'. “ Not just
yet though. You keep him for me a while, will you ?
Work him as a sot-oS for his keep.” The man was a
bit puzzled, but when the wife found that baby was
crumpling a £5 note in its little hand, Ball’s little game
was understood. That horra was never sent for. Now
this is the sort of “ personal ” we enjoy writing. But
deuced few people give us the ohanco.
In the House of Commons there are already
three representatives of evening papers, the most
active of whom is Passmore Edwards, of the Echo At
the next general election. Sir Algernon Borthwick, of
the Morning Post, and Lavi Lawson, of the Tele-
graph, will both be candidates ; and as Edmund Yates
is about to dispose of his World, it is not improbable
that he will also put up. Bowies, of Vanity Pair, has
been twice a candidate, and both times defeated, but it
is rumoured he will have a shy next time at Torquay.
•Several of the special correspondents have also been
spoken of as likely candidates. It is rather a pity, we
think, that Sydney journalism is not bettor represented
in Macqaarie-streec, Alfred, strange to say, has never
exhibited any political ambition, though his Demos-
thenic eloquence, and unexampled skill in the use of
the dissyllable, would shed a lustre on the High Court
of Parliament. Chris., too, really ought to put up.
Years ago, when he was yet in the full glow of hap-
piness, caused by the wearing of his first belltopper,
and in a sequestered paddock wo played kerosene-tin
cricket, his powers of argument when wishing, after
being obviously cut, to retain the paling and •' go on "
again, impressed us much as to his fitness for legislation.
Prank, also, has much that is solid about him (wedon't
mean his head), and, when he was comparatively a
cherub, exhibited a skill in fooling round the engine,
which was the admiration of all beholders. We have a
good mind to go into Parliament ourselves ; but before
wo do so, we must sea soma considerable modifications
made in the refreshment rules. We should want to
bring our own tucker, and bo allowed to wolf it in the
library. Por we’d lose all our self-respect at the
olghteenpenny tea if wo only so much as caught the
agonized eye of the caterer when either A.Q is stretch-
ing over for the butter or fll'Elhone is shrieking for
more hash. Wo might suggest that the Shroud put
forward tbe man on their staff who smells nicest; or
that the melodious singer who gave us 41 Cold as fish-
ponds frozen" in the Echo, renounce the muse for
legislation. Journalists are plentiful enough here, any.
how; and certainly there are many who, if elected,
would be, if not an ornament to tho Chamber, at least
an animated feature where the beer was.
These are solid facts. A certain Judge of an
inferior Court (mind you, wo don’t say he was an inferior
Judge of a certain Court/, iu addition to drawing a very
decent official screw, was the happy possessor of a
private fortune of £20,000 per annum, chiefly derived
from city property acquired for the most part in the
old days—in those halcyon times when lawyers who
couldn’t compare with Judah Bsnjimin and Cyrus Field
were able to obtain State preferment. Well, he was the
meanest man of all the Judges. Por example : meeting
on circuit one day a distinguished lawyer whose ideas
of hospitality were far mere than commensurate with
his means, ha raid loftily; “ Will you join me in a
bottle of beer, Maopheraon ? ” Macpherson said he
would; but when he saw that the Judge—who hwd
already emptied into his own glass and therefrom trans-
ferred to his capacious maw more than half the
contents of a small bottle of English ale—intended
for (him the undrinkable balance, he smiled, and
observed: “ Your Honor, that’s not enough for
me. Waiter, bring me a small bottle of Bulldog."
Once more. Victorian Judges, when on circuit
(and of course all this happened in Victoria), are
attended by a trooper, and it is the habit of their
Honors to say to their escorts, whoa a long journey has
boon accomplished; 11 Here, Mulqueeney, here’s a
sovereign. Have a bottle of wine at your dinner."
Therefore, our Judge, in pursuamoe of the time-
honoured custom, the other day, with an airiness not
nnmixed with dignity, remarked, after Mulqneeney’s
sword had dangled at his side over 40 miles along a
dusty bush-road : " Conetable, here, have a drink," and
he tendered the trooper— sixpence. But Mulqueeney
roso to the emergeney. He looked pityingly at the
coin in the Judge’s outstretched pilm, touched his hat,
and remarked, in a disciplinary tone which would have
gladdened the heart of Frederick of Prussia: “ Your
Honor, will you kindly hand the sixpence to the head of
the police. We are not allowed to receive gratuities,
even from their Honors the Judges, except through the
madeyum of our official superiors." But the Judge
didn’t “ take it.” Ha re-pooketod the *■ tanner," and
blandly replied: *■ You are a credit to the force, Mul-
queenoy."
By tho death ef Lord Avonmoro, the House of
Lords has beau relieved of tho presence of one here-
ditary scoundrel. There was a butcher in Ireland,
named Yolvertou, who had a clever, pushing rip of a
son, who took to law and politics by natural affinity.
An unscrupulous rascal, with considerable abilities, he
could not fail to make money in tho former capacity,
and he found a grand opening to distinction in the
latter—provided by tho turmoil and corruption of the
period which preceded tho Union, The British Govern-
ment had a grand necessity for Irish patriots who had
their price, and could nevertheless humbug the Irish
people up to the last moment. Ribbons and decorations
ware being hailsd on Irish Peers in return for their in-
fluence : and money, placos of profit, pensions, and dis-
tinctions were lavished on men of humbler rank
who were reckoned purchasable. Yelverton, the
butcher's son, and lawyer, plunged into tho
thick of this filthy mess, betrayed every unprofitable
trust, and was rewarded by a Patent of Nobility. True
nobility and he were bitter foes. Tho distinction con-
ferrod on him no honour, while he smirched the dis-
tinctioa with his own disgrace. This greatgrandson,
the Lord Avonmore just dead, "threw back" to this
distinguished ancestor. He was a blackguard of super-
lative merit. middle-aged man will be able to
remember the cause celebre of Yelverton v, Yelverton,
in which a poor lady sought to compel Major Yelverton
to recognise her as hie wife. Her maiden name was
Theresa Longworth, She died about a year ago. Her
claim Was recognised by one Court; but on appeal to
the House of Lords, that tribunal reversed the decision,
and left poor Theresa Longworth neitaor maid, wife,
nor widow. The gist of Yelverton’s defence was
that he had seduced the girl under a promise of
mairiago. A sweet defence, which brought a
storm of reprobation about his oars—especially as
this was merely his interpretation of the uuoon-
tested fact that he had gone through a Jsolomu
form of marriage with Miss Longworth in presence oi
one of her relatives and other witnesses, in Scotland j
and that she had consented to the omission of the clergy,
man on the doable assurance that a marriage so con-
tracted was legal in Scotland, and that secrecy was
demanded in view of the prejudices of his rich relative,
to whose title he was heir-at-law, bat who could, and
probably would, will away his property if ho learned
that his heir-expectant had married a girl belonging
only to the middle class. Miss Longworth was daughter
of a professional gentleman. When the case was being
tried. Major Yelverton wae asked in reference to this
point to define his idea of a lady. And the butcher
groatgrandsoa replied, with a lofty air, that the wore
meant ** a woman of gentle Hood."
The breach of promise action brought againa
Mr. JBiggar, M.P., was a screaming farce. Miss Hylanc
the love-lorn plaintiff, is a virgin of thirty-five, am
although resident in Paris, hailed from Kilkenny o:
feline fame. Biggar himself is an inflammatory youn(
spark of flfty.fonr. He talked of marriage and wedloo
to the fair Hyland, but he also talked e£ “ obstacles
and when she with maiden modesty pressed him to e:
plain the “obstacle," he told her soutontiously tha
“ cariosity lost Eve." When somebody sang “Oh Ir
laud, my darling 1" ho said Hyland was Ireland to him
but at the trial he wanted to make out that all h<
"meant was that Ireland is a Hyland. However, 1
kissed the eod in the latter form, and this little eute
prise led to a conversation between the pair on th
subject of kissing. Mr, Biggar said he was aware it wa
a question whether a lady should allow herself to
kissed before her marriage (laughter), and ho told ho
this was a difficulty about which theologians hat
differed. (Much laughter.) He assured the lady it wa
with great rogret ho should cause her any trouble wit
regard to that matter, and advised her to go to he
director and ask whether, under the oiroum
stances, kissing would bo permissible (laughter); an
he said she might assure hor spiritual director that h
was a man of honour, and that the engagement tc
marry would be carried out. Miss Hyland, accordingly
did consult her spiritual director, and thereafter M:
Biggar was in th* habit of kissing hor. Then, on a colt
day, walking with the plaintiff, Biggar waa so conocrnec
about her temperature that he made her keep her ban
in his pooket. At another time, in Eue do Villlers
he got down upon his knees, lifted her foot auc
kissed it (much laughter), saying, “ You see how mao!
I love you, and how devoted I am to go down on m
knees and kiss your foot j" and upon that footing tho :
remained. Also when they visited the Bon March(s to
gother ho bought her several pairs of stockings. Oh
Mr. Biggar, in his evidence, deposed that he firs
met the plaintive plaintiff at an entortaiumenl
“ The entertainment consisted of whisky and water.’
He said that one of the obstacles to his marriage wa
that he had two illegitimate children who were not ye
out in the world. Another was that his medical mar
had advised him not to marry any one, and he had u
particular desire to do so. The jury awarded the tigh
little Hyland £4OO, which her lawyers will get, o
course, as " costs between lawyer and client." Biggn
is worth about £20,000, commercially speaking; but a
54, probably £4OO is a fair valuation of his matrimonia
value.

Hia eye was stern and wild,
Hia cheek was pale and cold aa clay.
Upon his quivering lips a smile
01 jarful meaning lay.
Onoo more he gazed upon the scroll,
Oaca more its wards he road.
Then calmly with unflinching hand
Ds folds before him spread.

The bine, cold, glittering steel.
And grimly try the tampered edge
Ho was so soon to feel.
A sickness crept upon my heart.
And dizzy swam my head,
I could not stir, I could not cry,
I felt benumbed and dead.
Black icy borrow struck me dumb,
And fused my senses e’er ;
I closed my eyes in utter fear.
And strove to think no more
Again I looked ; an awful change
Across his face had passed ;
Ho seemed to rave—on cheek and lip
A flake of foam was oast.
He raised on high the gli tering blade,
Then first I found a tongue ;
“ Hold! madman I Stay the frantic deed I"
I cried, and forward sprung.
Ha heard me, hat he heeded not;
One glance around he gave.
And ere I could arrest his hand
Ho had commenced—to shave.

In consequence of remarks in Truth anent the
Salvation Army talanoc.sheet. General Booth sent
in . . a 2 Ci'py and re inestcd tho journalist to
satisfy lumaelf. no doubt ospoiting him to aokaowledge
hiBem>r, Iruih, however, to the Gencrai'a disgust,
aiya that the b-J&Moe sheet is just aa unsatisfactory as
lfc j :e v ßo /' kept on badness principles, and ia no
credit to the firm cf auditors. Nothing is clear, except
fch *t the General has tho control of everj thing, aad is
indignant because overdone tiae won’t implicitly trust
him. Pa?haps the most remarkable specimen of Booth's
powers of finance is his proposition that those who
cannot afford to give him money for tho Army should
(end it on interest; for which purpose ho establishes a
bank, and issues promissory nptes, which, he naively
observes, '' will secure due payment." Mow the issuing
of a promissory note *'secures" its being paid, he
omits to explain. Of this remarkable scheme, Truth
says : “ Commercially considered, it is so a c f ouudingly
i that I am ino’iaed to believe the General ia
utterly ignorant of the most elementary principles cf
finance."
Ihe landlord organs of London, which, by the
way, are the source whence is derived tbe material for
the violently partisan cablegrams published by the
Colonial Press, combined to shriek that Forster had
conclusively demonstrated the villainy of Parnell and
his associates in Parliament, and that Parnell's reply
was feeble and unmeaning. The popular papers in
London oammentina very differt at spirit, however, and
had the cable messages been based on their expressions,
thess telegrams would have sounded quite a different
key-note. Observe how Reynolds' Newspaper treats
the case. It says that 14 Mr, Forster, on rising, was
cheered by the Tories. He proceeded in a tone of slow
and deliberate spits to deliver his accusation. With
the exception of a few sentences, the whole cpseoh was
read from the manuscript. It was a tedious proceeding,
for it occupied at least two hours. There was no-
thing novel in the harangue; it was simply tho old
material re-arranged." Why, tha S M. Herald and
Echo, and tbe rest of them, have all the while been
characterising Forster’s speech ag a “brilliant oration 1”
And of Parnell's reply, Keywords aremarks:— ‘ Mr. Par.
noli stood aloco. Five hundred English and Scotch depu-
ties eat around. Too future English king came down to
listen. More peers than ordinarily sat in tho gilded
chamber, crowded tbeir special gallery. Ambassadors
of foreign powers, distinguished etrangeis, and dames
with proud names were iu attendance. It was an nr-
rivalled position, and an unrivalled opportunity. There,
oalm and unmoved, sat the man by whose single genina
a distracted and envious faction was constituted a
party; small, but determined; despised, bus mocese-
ful His personal foe, tho disgraced Irish Miui-ter,
wa ted uneasily in his place. The fate of a Ministry
and the probable destiny of a nation bung on what the
ycuag and resolute Irish tribune might say. As the
clock struck five the member for tho capital of Munster
rose in his place, and, with perfect self-possession, pro-
ceeded to address th* H ruse. He was much cheered by
the young men, his colleagues. When silence was
restored, ho at once struck the key-note of the situa-
tion by saving that be was aware anything ho might
utter would have no effect with an assembly which had
already prejudged the oise. Fr.m a packed jury—the
landlords and capitalists of Eng and—ho appealed to
the democratic misses of his countrymen st
home and abroad, fu the course of his mbscqusLt
observations he pointed oat certain misteproseo- ’
tations, wilful omissions, and misleading statements."
And here’s what the Weekly Dispatch, another oner-
mcusly influential London paper, haysajoutlbe debate:
—‘ Tho most obnoxious cf all the ‘amendments’ was
Mr. Qorst's, and the wor-t incident in the angry debate
it gave rise to was Mr. Forster a speech. Wo are aa
adieus as Mr. Forster himself can be that Irish crime
and sedition should ba tiaeed to their source, and that
all in high quanen who can be shown to have tolerated
and profited by the traits of the muider conspiracy
should bo denounced ns sharers iu the guilt »f the
actual assassins. (Hear, hoar! Ed, Bulletin)
If Mr. Forster cr anyone else can prove that
Ms. Parnell and hie friends were thus gnil y, he
will be doing a public rervioe. But that, if dune at
all, should be done in an orderly way, and at a proper
time and place, not by the heaping up of reaklass asser-
tions in the Hons jof Commons. He was not justified
ia taking up that position last week, at a moment
when, a good deal of sympathy having been dirc-clrd to
him by the evidence given nt Kilmainham as to the plots
against his own life, andat leaskaa < qual amount of pre-
judice having been raised against Mr. Parnell by other
portionsof thatevideuec, an impartial discussion of the
question was imposssiblo. Mr. Forster is to be blamed,
not for attacking Mr. Parnell, bat for choosing a tiino
and method for tho attack which prevented Mr. Parnell
from meeting him cn fair terms. It was not in the in-
terests of “ law and order ’’ in Ireland, but for bis own
vainglory and to help tha Tories in their partisanship,
that Mr. Foister made hia speech “ And here we have
another voice. The News of the World, an English
newspaper of immense circulation among the working
daises throughout the United Kingdom:—“Yet Mr.
Parnell was able to make out a faiily good ease for him-
self in reply. The case was eot good enough to stand
in a court ,of law; lut neither was Mr. Forster's
cisa against him. It has happened as was to be
expected when time, place, and every other con-
dition were ill-ohoien fer ono member of Par-
liament bringing against another a charge of

By the last mail, oar Auckland correspondent
informs us that the Eloisa Jr.no Company are playing
in payable houses there, having no opposition. How-
,Vr it is not done without a lot of hard work, for there

We stated last week that Mr Dixon (the tenor,
lat« of the Clark and Ryman crowd) was about to return
to America cn Thursday, Well, to hasn’t gone yet,
and is about to have a benefit, in which a very big crowd
will appear. Me. Sheridan is going to read for him,
Mies Teresa Horan is going to sing for him (this attrac
tion alone should fill tho ’all'), Mr. Dixon himself will
warble, and o. tremendous list of supporters is booked.
The names include those of J. A. South and Edith
Pender (whose prettv face will be as welcome to us as a
haldbead’Bfl-'wers toa spofoblessjujurdiite of the robust
erder). Mr. J- P. West ("Ha, ha! But no marr-
tter-rrV') M's? Mavjfio Oliver (come, now!) Mies Tilly
Lake, Hiss Grace Eenr ques (tell us about this nowl)
Miss Horan, as aforesaid, and Mr. Sheridan ; with Miss
Lucy Fraser (popularly known as Frashar), and little
Annie Said, These, with Mr. Edwin Palmer, are the
principals- We understand that Mr. D has secured the
Masonic Hall, no other place being available This is a
very great pity ; for* while that lugubrious building is,
on tho whole, preferable in respect to associations to
the glittering Palace cf Varieties, yet we doubt if the
original David ware announced to play oa the harp
btfore Saul, a*d the management promised that Saul
should heave the original javelin at the Psalmut,
whether there would even be a rush o! democratic two
bobbers. So far as we ate concerned, there is no good
fortune in reipeot to this performance (to take place on
Monday w jt.) that wa do not wish Mr. D x n, who is
fortunate in possessing, not only a splendid voice, but
the goodwill of that kind of which is denied to
the professional oad and to the cabotin.

Mr. and Mra. Dixon would have left by the mail,
but owing to eomplioatjoua re the Clark and Hyman
business. Mr D was arrested at the suit of Mr. Bay lees
tho evening before the boat started. There was a most
otleoiWo tableau at the Royal Hotel that night. Dixon,
pale, between two Supreme Court, bailiffs ; Mrs D., iu
toil's and curls; Miss Sally Forde (the confidante), la
tears, lut no curls; a iresrfber of tho Press, thought-
fully grieved at the sigh* of tlia bailiff's ; and' a lady
member of tho Red fftccsing Minstrels (now deceased—
tko troupe, we meau)/f hysterical, wilh her head iu an
angle of the wall and her feet spread spasmodically
ever the whole apartment Tt wasn’t very terrible,
after all, though. The great L. M. wns not adamant;
nud, in a very little while, tho tuneful pris'uer was
weeping upon his wife’s Shoulder, a froo man, 'Hion
someone said “Btiug out the deir children;” but
Mr. D., with a taa-cup-like smile, explained that there
were none on hand just then, but—however . . . .
It w-uild have added greatly to the effeet of the tableau
if, like Mr. Kenwiga in the reconciliation with tha
Water-rate CoMbotoir, Dixon could have hysterically
carried in half a dozen litfbto cherubs in their night-
gowns, and, spreading theip in a heap before tho com-
pany, have sung, with his inimitab’o voice, a hymn of
thanksgiving. Something like this
Saved from tho fug ! let loud the strains
Of joy float through this realm ;
Gone is distress, so Heaven bless
The sainted name of L M,
Bat you can't do that tort ef thing, you know, when
you are an your honeymoon trip.

Sheridan was lo haws had a ben. at. tho Royal—
a mafinbe; but he is nop informed that Romany
Hignold, Etq , considering that the affair might inter-
fere with hie benefit (also on the tapis), has declined to
let Kfng Lear have the theatre. It does not come
within the pgbvinoa of any «itic in tWie city to do
aught but praise Mr. Rignold foe whatever he does. So
he has our felicitations accordingly.
• • •
Mr. Sheridan, however, must, for the honour of
the drama, have a bcnlefli before he leaves ua, aud it
would be a graceful art on the part of Judge Windeyea,
who is the president of the School ef Arte, and a great
patron of the drama, to u»e his influence with the com.
mittee to let Mr. Sheridan have the hall' for a classic
performance before he loavea us. If ho did this, not-
withstanding the feet that we have almost exhamted
the encomia at our disposal on handsome George, we
would endeavour to “ put a little on his Honor’s

Alice Lingard has got tho London critics. In
saying this we are perfecTy Sear.etlous ; and while
*’ Mankind" was not a go in Melbourne, “ Taken from
Life," by Peltitfc, appears fo have got them. Bu', great
Heaven, how much more melodrama with “ magnifi cut
aud realistic effects never hi fore attempted?’ And
this is interesting. “Dearer than Lite," recently
being played at Toole’s Theatie in London, was
orgiually produced at Queen’s Theatre (Lahou-
ehere’s) with the following artists in the cast : Toole,
Irving, Lionel Brough, Charles Wyndham. and John
Clayton—the latter perhaps tho host “s’raight”
comedian in England. Oh, and mirk t Marie Prescott
has decided to hold over Oscar Wilde’s play of ‘‘Vera."
Well might Oncar say, “ Harvier not the nerve to pro-
duce it?" But to descend from frivolity, let ua sta* e
that Darrell s new and entirely original dr.ima from his
own pen, the “ Sunny South,” is still running in Mel-
bourne at the Opera House ; and, though he is making
money, Bill Holloway is gloomy. His only occupation
now is to occasionally polish up the hilt of Romeo’s
sword with emery-paptr.
** * *
We wore present at the Gaiety, tho night before
the Opera opened, to see “the Gaiety Comedy Com-
pany "in “ The Colleen Bawn " As we sat down, pre-
pared to indulge alternately in “cheers, tears, and
laughter," we saw by a glance at the playbill that there
were no less than three “ stars " in the troupe— Miss
Maggie Oliver, Miss “Maria Wilton,” and Mr. J. B.
Steele. This at once set our minds easy as to tho ar-
tistic result of tho paiformance—for it has been laid
down in dramatic circles that nano but first-class people
should allow their names to be printed in display type,
and this rule war so strictly adhered to in tho pro-
grammes of the Loudon Comedy Company that no
even comparatively respectable actors such aa Fred.
Marshall aud Titheradge over. appeared in anything
larger than the Email caps, allotted to fha rest of the
company. Thus, seeing, in wo have said, no less than
three stars in one drama, we prepared by placing cur
handkerchief on our knees, aud making fast our teeth
with a piece of lemonade wiie, to laugh and weep.
« • *
We began to laugh immediately. Miss Maggie
Oliver, who enacted the part of Ann Chute at once put
us in a good humour. Her costume was a combination
of green and ever}thing, aud she was so vivacious, that,
had we not seen the play before, wa should have
momentarily expected a silver clog-dance or a college
hornpipe. In a woid. Mies Oliver’s esneeption of Ann
is aa much like Gerald Griffin’s drawing of an Irish
gentlewoman as a frog-fight is like a funeral. Rut it
was funnj—very funny; aud if Ann Chute had only
been drawn as a funny character by Griffin, and Bouci-
oaultod Into one by tho dramatist, Maggie would have
been perfect. But the hilarity of Miss Oliver’s Ann
Ghnlo. who is not meant to be hilarious, was nothing to
the mournfulneES of Mr. Steele’s Miies-aa-Coppaloen,
who is generally uudorsloid to boa particularly jovial
character. We didn’t mind so much his not knowing
tho words, but there was a settled gloom upon him in
the humorous speeches which pointed to something
—an oyster-stew, probably—having disagreed with him.
He brightened a little whan coming in in the second
scene with tho whisky-keg, but only seemed perfectly
at ease when sitting down upon it.
• « •
Miss “ Marie Wilton’s ” Eily O’Connor was a
performance which we shall remember (should we live
so long) jmtii the crack of doom. Her Colleen Bawn
was a Colleen Bawn just resurrected—the intense pallor
of her face, the strange attenuation of her form, sug-
gosling that she'd just pushed open tho lid of the
coffla after a twen'y-t m days’ trance. Under these
circumstances, her 1 tinontations were received den-
si vely, and it was felt by the pit from the very start
that, by drowning, her Danny Menu was not only con-
ferring a service upon Hardress Cregan but upon the
laud of Ireland generally. Under thase melancholy
circumstances, Cates was crushed from the commence-
ment, and as he knew very little about the text, and
Miles less, some of the scenes in which they flgnrad-
wtre of a very entertaining nature.
• • •
Miss Mary Ann Melville (will you never grow
old, dear Mrs. J'srley) said what the knew of Mrs.
Cregan with muoh haughtiness, and refused her land-
lord’s offer of marriage in such a cavalier manner, that
she has choked us off, at one j amp, from ever proposing.
The gentleman who played Father Tom—we charitably
hide his name—moved us to silent tears; but Mr. J.
P. West’s Danny Mann was a first rate melodramatic
study : so good that, but for him, the popular indigna-
tion would, in all probability, have taken the form of
orange-peel. Tho mounting was excellent, though the
light on the hill in the first set was so large that at
first sight it looked like an eruption. The attendance
was almost as slim as the Colleen.
• • •
A vory different ecene. however, presented its-
self when the Italian operatic commonwealth, of which
Riccardi is manager, presented “Faust” at the same
theatre When we arrived, the place was crammed,
and we haven’t seen so many shirt fronts gathered to-
gether at one time, since by invitation of the manage-
ment we went to pick our own out at the Steam
Laundry. Riccardi, in the full lustre of his manly
beauty, stood basking in the moonlight, and Bzyltss, iu
a fautail-banger of ’Murkun cut (“ we should smile ”)
and “3f " cap, stood one expansive smile beside him.
The auditorium presented a really rekerky aspect, two
central figures being Sheridan aud the fair Louisv,
while two boxes on the upper tier were occupied by a
bank manager and his family—we counted seventeen—
and the footman, probably, as in the case of the menial
at Miss Snevellici’s bespeak, “ Saw the play through
the pane of glass in the box door for nothing." That
night, seated on a chair, was a discontented critic. He
wanted a screen to guard him against the draught, a
fan to waft away the heat, two footstools, some whisky
at the expense of the management, and the loan of
Riccardi’s opera-glaseos, We are glad to be able to
show up such arrogance; and we are prepared to take
all the consequences, as we fearlessly state that the
critic'in question was —ourselves.

Of the opera itself, the chief interest at once
cantered in the Mephisto. of Signor Graziosi, aud the
Margueiite (we are writing in English!) of Signor
Racfcole Graziosi. The former gentleman is a consum-
mate artist, and his voice, capable of great dramatic
expression, was very effective throughout the opera
Of Signora Graziosi's Maiguerite, we can'tiuly say
that, while some of the poetry which wo might natur-
ally expact to see infused into so romantic a role, was
lacking, yet her impersonation was pleasantly pathetic.
Her voice, though not a sopraaa of surpasi ing richness,
yot is singulaily sweet, and has quite sufficient volume
to satisfactorily fill the Gaiety—even to the corner
where the p easant youth mounts guard over coats and
hats. The Faust of Signor Castelli was more remark-
abla for the exhibition cf a sonorous tenore robusto than
for tho acting; his movements lacking pueiry cf
motion, and his appearance suggesting an unwise fond-
ness lor the maooaroni cf his native country. Signor
Viganotti’s Valentine was satisfactory, and Sig-
nora Venoata was picture squely melodious as
Siebel Taken as a whole, and this is after
all tho great thing, this company of artists,
without of course being of first-class calibre, possesses
the ability to give tho public a refined musical evening
—an amusement, be it said, to which the Sydney public
have long teen strangers. The mounting reflects tho
highest credit upon Mr. Kinchela —who is without a
doubt the cleverest artist (uext to Gordon) in Aus-
tralia. Some of bis sets upon-that little stage are truly
marvels. —and that is saying a good deal.

“Captain” Jefferies, of the Salvation Army, was
fined 5; or fourteen days by the Wokingham bench, for
obstructing the street by holding a service, and had to
“take it out." General Booth so ordained. When
Jefferies was released there was a big parade The
“Captain " was hoisted on a pony aud marched through
the streets, preceded by a band, A mob collected, un-
horsed the Captain, captured his banner, and wore pro-
csediug to improve the victory, when the police in-
torfored.

One day within the last fortnight—wo speak by the
card —a poor woman whoso husband was dying went to
the minister of a parish in this oolony—it would be
superfluous to say in what district, as the devil pro-
bably knows his address, and nobody else is interoeted
in him—and asked him tor the love of God to come and
say some words of comfort to her husband before ha
went out into the darkness. The precious vessel of
grace replied that “ho really couldn't spare the time,
aa his wife was at a friond'a house, and he couldn’t

John Bright has written on tho Oaths question,
to a correspondent:—“ On the question of oaths, pro-
bably there is nothing in the New Testament more
especially condemned and forbidden than oaths. To
those who do not care about the New Testament this
fact will be of no weight. Tho practice of swearing to
tho truth of anvthiug makes two kinds of truth or
truthfulness. It oaths are of any avail, by so much as
they make truth more certain, by so much they lessen
the value of an ordinary statement, and diminish the
probability of its truth. If ignorant persona are not
sworn, they think they may tell lies with impunity',
and their lying is made to a large extent blameless in
their eyes. I think oaths and oath.taking have done
more than any other thing to impair and destroy a
regard for truth. If you wish to see the question
treated more at large, yon will find it in an admirable
book, ‘ Dymond’s Essays on Morality.’”
The Queensland Guardian says “ We
understand that the Rev. A. A. Jvlaclarea (who has won
golden honours in the North) was offered tho post of
locum tenons at All Saints, Woollahra, Sydney, but that
the Very Rev. the Dean of Sydney, who at present acts
as Vicar Ganeral, has declined to license him on the
ground of his being a High Churchman It is well to
remind churchmen that this attempt on the part of tho
authorities in Sydney to provide a • close pasture * for
evangelicals (so called) in tho diocese of Sydney is
altogether illegal. No bishop or vicar-general has any
right, to demand from a priest or deacon any tests other
the Church requites, and the Church does not require a
man to speak me shibboleth of a sect.” The Guardian
winds np its smack at Dean Gowper by asking him to
learn a lesson of charity from the late Archbishop of
Canterbury, whoso last public aot was to negooiate an
exchange between Mr. Maconoohio, of St. Alban’s,
Holborn, and Mr. Suckling, of St. Peter’s, Loudon.
When the Church plays cards with the devil, the
devil invariably loses—in this world. Horse-racing has
over and over again been denounced by the godly aa the
sport of the devil. What follows, therefore, is quite
logical. “ Germanton Races, 1883. Thursday, 12bh
April. A concert will be held on the evening of tho
above date, at St. George’s Hail, Germanton, in aid of
fencing tho Parsonage Glebe," Of oaurso 1 The
children of darkness coming home flashed with the
sinful and perishable coin of this world will be waylaid
by the children of light, who will take the min and make
their hearts merry with music, and then—pass round
the hat. 3 his is the way to cripple the devil. Money
is always an incentive to sin—in the hands of sinful
men. That’s why your really enterprising holy man
exerts himself to lessen this temptation to evil as much
as ever he can by wrestling with it himself. The genera-
tion when tho children of darkness were wiser than the
children of light mast have bean in very ancient days
indeed.
Martin Tupper—the proverbial pbilosopbool—
has written to the Mornin g Post on the Oaths question,
his text being “ So help me God, I will not move a yard.”
The Weekly Dispatch comments .—Enter Mr. Tupper,
using profane language. “ So help mo, God,” h© says,
“ I will not move a yard I" from which it might be
inferred that he had been dining ont and was being
moved on by a policeman. However, that is not a fair
statement of the facta. Mr. Tapper is only lotting him-
self out on tho Oaths question, as thus
“ Yot, now oar Senate schemes to spurn aside
(On false pretence of Liberal brotherhood).
The Heavenly Father of cur earthly good,
Because odd Atheist has his God denied.”
This is the true butterwoman’s trot to market. It would
he easy to make verses like that by the yard. For ex-
ample
So help mo. Tapper, why, wo thought you dead,
Laid, with your Proverbs, in a decent grave.
Somewhere, where daisies grow and violets wave,

There was a scene in court when Mr. Foote,
pubii.her of Freethought, was condemned to twelve
months’ imprisonment. •* Immediately upon the pass-
ing of this sentence, a scone of the greatest excitement
and tumult ensued in the gallery, which was full of the
prisoners’ fiienda. Rising, as it seemed, with one
accord, they burst forth into a storm of hissing, groan-
ing, and derisive cries. The prisoner Foote brought
about a momentary lull, a=, looking towards tho Bench,
he cried: ‘ My lord, 1 thankjou; it is worthy of jour
weed,’ but immediately afterwards the uproar became
worse than ever, several persons calling out, ’Chris-
tians, indeed!’ and ’Judge Jtlfries.’ It being found
impossible for tho ■. flioers of the court to obtain any.
thing lite decent order from the defiant audience in the
gallery, the judge ordered that portion of the court to
be summarily chared, which was done after some little
trouble by the vo ice, and even then the rear of the
crowd in the street could be plainly heard inside.”
Couple this with the fact that Mr. Bradlaugh was in a
position to march to Westminster, had he liked, 150,000
delegates—not single sympathisers, but delegates—each
of whom represented large bodies of people in a different
part of Great Britain, to piesent petitions supporting
his claim_ to be allowed to take his seat, and it will
bo perceived that a great religions movement in
favour of Rationalism is working in the old country.
Additional evidence to the same effect is furnished by
what took place at Plymouth, .of which district Mr.
Foote is a native, when news of his conviction
was; received, A Mr. Cousins, of Leeds, had come to
the town aa a candidate to represent it iu Parliament in
the Liberal interest. But (*ve quote) “la tho face of the
opposition from the advanced section of tho pirty,
because of his indisposition to comply with their
demands on this question, Mr. Cousins has announced
his intention not to persist in hia candidature, and will
not address a public meeting of the electors, ns had been
arranged.” Aud under date March 13th the following
news from Plymouth appears in the London press
“ Tho Home Secretary has been appealed to in the
matter of the sentence on Mr. Foote, who is a native of
this district, and who resided for some years in Ply-
mouth. T-io Homo Secretary, however, has declined to
interfere, but further pressure is to to brought to boar,
and steps are being taken to organize a deputation,
which Sir William Hareourt will be asked to receive.
It ia understood that arrangements have been in ido to
carry on the Freetiiinkee, and a National Association
for the Repeal of the Blasphemy Lxws ia being formed, a
meeting in connection with which will shortly be ho d
in London.”
With respect to the prosecution of London
Freethought the Home News, quoted by the S. M.
Herald, refers to the sentence on the dif.ndinta aa
“exemplary:” and with respect to thoir contention
that many writers of distinction attacked the Christian
religion with impunity, remarks:—“The men whom
the blasphemers ot the Freethinker insulted by men-
tioning iu the same category with themselves, however
heterodox sima of their writings may ha, have always
dealt with the Christian revelation in a serious spirit,
and have not shocked publio feeling by an irreverence
indistinguishable from indecency.” This may bo ac-
cepted as a fair representation of the feeling of tho
organs of the upper and bourgeois classes. Bat, as a
matter ot fact, tho Sooiety for the Suppression of Blas-
phemy has announced its determination, as soon as it
has funds enough, to institute prosecutions against
Professor Huxley, Dr. Tyndall, Mr. Herbert Spencer,

Mills’ works, and several other well-known learned
ard scientific persons And hero is how one ot tha
most influential and widely-circulated papers in Eng-
land—a people’s paper—comments on the affair“ The
Freethinker prosecution is just one of those cases
in which people are peculiarly apt to losa sight
of tho essential principle involved in it, because
they happen to be out of sympathy with tha
particular individual against whom aa ancient and
obsolete law has been set in motion. Wo emphatically
demur to the doctrine that it is tho business of a court
of law to protect the sensibilities of devout Ohr’stiatiH
by punishing thosa who effend them. What is sauce
for tho goose is sauce for the gander. Is not a Free-
thinker fed with the same food, hurt with the same
weapons, Subject to the same diseases, as a Christian
is ? If the sensibilities of one kind of British citizen
are entitled to legal protection, then, unquestionably,
the sensibilities of all British citizens are equally en-
titled; and, in that ease, wo should at this moment
have the Boot Laureate serving out h.y twelve mouths’
imprisonment for having done grievous hurt to tho
freethinking sensibilities of the Marquis of Queens-
bery, Iu truth, the logical consequences of this theory
of legal protection would bo that ail our philosophers,
theologians, and men of science would have to be shut
mp in prison iu order to deter them from doing wrong
to the sensibilities of this or that section of the British
publio. General Booth would have to be locked up
atones aa a standing outrage upon tho sensibilities of
tho Skeleton Army. No reader acquainted with tho
writings of Professor Huxley can have failed to per-
ceive how easily bin sonsibiU’ ios ai e wounded by bishops
and Positivists. All these, therefore, would have to bo
deprived of their liberty, Ritualists and Evangelicals
would have to be committed to gaol by hundreds and
thousands, being no better than so many Kilkenny oats
in their theological relations. And Mr. Justice North
himself, on tho complaint of tbo readers of the Freb.
thinker, would bo obliged to leave his seat of jadg-
mont, and bo conducted to durance vile under the
supervision of his own theriff.” With reference
to the forthcoming prosecutions against Tyndal,
Huxley, and others, the same journal remarks
“Mr. Justice North's charge to tha jury is quite
explicit on this point. Mr. Foote was accused cf
“ blasphemy,” and blasphemy, as defined by Mr. Justice
North, ia involved in ‘ any act exposing tbo Holy
Scriptures and the Chriati .u religion to ridicule, con-
tempt, aud derision.' Upon this defiaitiou of blas-
phemy a jury had no alternative but to bring iu a
verdict of guilty against Mr. Foote, and they would
equally have been without alternative if Professor
Huxley, or the Duke ef Somerset, or Mr Congreve had
been the subject of persecution.” And, by the way, were
the Crown Princess at Prussia, Queen Victoria's own
daughter, aud the future Empress ot Germany, to
publish her Freethinking opinions while on a visit to
England, ehe would be equally amenable to the obsolete
law under which Mr. Tooth was sentenced, and if pro-
secuted could not equitably escape conviction for twelve
months with hard labour.

At three o'clock yesterday afternoon the new City
Band pave their inaugural peifonnauce from a platform
in the fountain at the Exhibition. About a thou sard
persons present; ten pieces were played, thirty-four
instrumentalists, under the leadership of Sebastian
Hodge, aud their performance met with a gratifying
recognition—as it well deserved. The “Snowdrop
Polka," a cornet so'o by Swtetman, aho the trombone
solo by Joseph Parkes, were specially good, and
encored; but all the pieces were excellent. Mayor and
Aldermen and many prominent aud mu-deal people pre.
sent, of course. Some remarkably handsome toilets
were observed. Mrs. Harris wore fawn eatin and
moire s , bonnet with ruby velvet facings and fawn
feather and gloves. Mrs. Roberts, a fine black
satin skirt, deep lace flounces and broche bodice,
cream bonnet and pansies. Another nice creation was
a black velvet shirt, double-breasted jacket of figured
brown velvet and pearl buttons. Very handsome was a
shaded old gold plush pleated skirt, and black velvet
panier bodice, cream lace trijnmings, hat, feathers,
and gloves ; also an olive green satin and brocht s , plaid
bonnet and parachute. Refreshments, flowers, wines,
ice creams, &c., were provided by the Mayor (Mr.
Harris) upstairs, and the matinee ended very success,
fully at 5 o’clock.


PEPPER AND SALT.
It is cheering to learn that the Czar is positively
to be crowned next month. The postponement of the
coronation must have occasioned deep disappointment
fit Moscow and elsewhere. All the European Courts
had arranged to send their Uriahs to spread themselves
on the occasion. The British Government is said to
have been much divided as to who should represent
England. The Queen wanted Parnell to be sent, and
the Whig section of the Cabinet supported Her Ma-
jesty. But Sir Charles Dilke and the Eadioals in the
Ministry thought Prince Alfred could bo better spared,
and they carried the day. Just before the Czar an-
nounced that he had funked again, a compromise was
arrived at, and both parties in the Cabinet had agreed
to send Carey, C.M.G , as he is used to that sort of
thing. But it is the householders in Moscow who
feel the disappointment most directly. The rent o*
lodgings had gone up to Exhibition prices. Furnished
rooms well away in the suburbs, outside the radius of
of the explosion, wore up to £3 per day. Apartments
commanding a view of the procession were fetching
fabulous prices from enthusiasts who wanted to see the
thing “go off well while good dry cellars, handy to
the Kremlin, and possessing reasonable facilities for
mining purposes, wore at a premium. But the person who
Is most bitterly mortified is our own Alfred. He was
counting upon a special opening for displaying his well-
known literary style by dashing off a' par, relating how
the Czit “ went ofi well and gave pleasure to all.” And
he had meant to pub it under the heading *' Mining
Intelligence : Great Eise in Czars.”

Tho Cliadband style of oratory is becoming day
more popular amongst the clergy. Wo hare lately
looked in at several services, and wo have invariably
been treated to tho same peculiar drone. The best
example of Mr. Chadband's eloquence is, probably, his
speech to Sir Leicester Dedlook, on coming to sell tho
Hawdon secret. Here it is i—
«• My friends, wo are now—Eaohaol my wife, and
I—in the mansions of tho rich and great. Why are
wo now in the mansions of the rich and great, my
friends ? Is it because we are invited P Because we
are bidden to feast with them, because we are
bidden to rejoice with them, because we are bidden
to play tho Into with them, because wo are bidden
to dance with them ? No. Then why are wo hero,
my friends P Are we in possession ®f a sinful secret,
and do we require corn, and wine, and oil—or,
what is much the same thing, money—for tho keep,
ing thereof? Probably so. my f hen is."
In this will bo found by a mind analytic the essence of
tho religious stylo. And it only falls a little short of
being very groat. Here, anyhow, one's mind is pre-
pared for tho coming shock j and wo consider that those
reverend gentlemen who have not tackled this mode of
speaking in its integrity, should do so without delay.
Par better this, than sudden state
“ Just plank down for my water-rate 1 ”
Or, 11 While they eing, just take the tip.
Your Pastor wants his half-year’s trip."
Much bettor, t jo, than, in stern manner,
* Say “ All is harr’d less than a tanner;"
Or, “ Now, then, Deacons, scoop the pools!
Come, ante-up, now, for the schools 1 ”
Oh, wa have heard the parsons all—
Tho fat, the thin, tho short, the tall:
Wo’vo hang with unspeakable bliss

And gently slumb’ring we have been
When we have mumbling heard tho Dean,
And humbly thank him we did s( rive,
For his sweet sermon’s sedative.
Each has his points, and some have wit;
All hate the venal threep’nny-bit;
And that’s the only peint, indeed,
On which all parsons seem agreed.

It was a blow for her. He had just said —

The Sydney citizens are enraged at the intelli-
gonoo that tho metropolitan milk contains 30 per cent,
of water. And yet no one scorns to complain at getting
methylated spirit in the whisky bottle, and being charged
61, a glass for it. The most indignant man in Sydney
about tho milk racket is a small grocer. But, then, it
must be remembered that his sugar only contains 40 per
cent, of sand.

What, about the clerk, Guy, who was abduotod
from tho Dublin Telegraph Office P Is his statement a
true bull, or is it a Florence Dixie ? We remember, on
one occasion, being absent from our office for four days.
That was about tho time tho Assyrian came down on
the Flemingtoa fold. On our return wo gave a brilliant
circumstantial account of how we had been kidnapped
to Melbourne, and. coerced with bludgeons to do the
Cup for another paper. We will not recall the expres-
sion on the editorial mug when we had concluded. But
we have now, and will carry to our grave, a distinct
recollection of the weight of a carpet slipper.
Tho devil is having rather the beet of it, j ast
now, we are sorry to say. Not only is tho Harmy in
tuoublo in Melbourne, and Frank Warden doing a time
in Dorlinghurst, but now we see that a Mrs. W. has
been committed for a pair of opera glasses—a piece of
intelligence, wo should say, which will cast a gloomy
shadow over heaven. Wo are, anyway, inexpressively
grieved at tho turn things are taking. It was only just
as Frank dropped into it over the “ still's,’' that we had,
at his instigation, got up all the facta about Jacob and
tho late Mrs. Lot, until wo were ablo to hold forth on
tho Scriptures with much glibnesr, much to the enter-
tainment of our olive branches, who, we regret to say,
however, evinced at times a scepticism bordering upon
ridicule—their indignation at the mess of pottage epi-
sode taking the form of date-stones. As things stand,
at present, we arc uneasy. We hardly know where to
go and do our Sunday wrestle |now. The Temple Jef-
feris is too expensive; besides wo cannot stand a deacon
there who
" Holds ne with his glittering eye.”
Tho Kev. Thomas Kemmis wo like much j but a month’s
attendance at his church nearly ruined ns in silk socks
and hair-oil. The Kev. Mr. Ullman is about to shake

furthermore, that our Harmy here contemplates dis.
bandment, and that Captain Sutherland is taking a
great interest in the wages question, while; the lieu-
tenant makes a perfect snail’s track down the “ wanted*
column of the Herald as be peruses that journal out-
side the office in Hnuter.street of a morning. The
more we think of it, the sorrier we are that Frank is
not once more at liberty. There was about that man a
weird and terrible earnestness. And yet he could adapt
himself to the airy and the rugged nature alike. What
a sweet thing it was to see him weep in his hymn-book
one moment, and go out with the jug the next. Poor
Frank the Baptist!
The Czar’s coronation has been again postponed:
a circumstance which points to the inevitable conclusion
that Alick wishes once more to taste strawberries and
cream. Asa matter of fact, it it’s not done in a Soho
coal-hole or in the sewer under Edinburgh House, the
ceremony won’t take place at all. We never thought it
would. What's the good of it, anyhow ? He can’t
administer the Government, or anything—except a sly
kick to the Missus at msa.l times, when he catches her
carrying on with an equerry. And, then, who’s going
to the ceremony ? Why, as a matter of fact, it will be
seen that at the last moment nobody will turn up

The Turaut people aro growling about their lock-
up. It seems to T o about the size of a Moorish dead-
house, and almost as secure as a sixpenny cat-collar.
The other day there was, strange to say, a prisoner
there; and as it was a rainy night, ho was kept going un-
til morning fastening the door with his braces and bar-
ricading it with his mattress to keep the wet out.
Finally, perceiving that nothing would prep up the por-
tal, the prisoner hunted up a constable and borrowed
one of his boots. Then he slept peacefully until morn,
ing, when daylight revealed the fact that the roof was
going. Climbing up, he fixed on the rim as well as he
could with his shoe-laces, and then essayed once mare
to compose himself to slumber. But a hail-storm
brought a rent in the roof again, and the wind beat in
the door, till at last, grown desperate, he cried out—“Hi,
sargint, come quick now and put irons on me ; I’m
mortial toirod houldin' this ould gaol thegither.” Tes,

they want lots of things besides—pretty well every-
thing, except more clergyman.
The Rev. Hung Fat is Wesleyan Missionary to
his benighted brjthren iu tho Biliarat district, Vic-
toria, and he tarns up periodically with a batch of con-
verts for public baptism. Usually a fat missionary,
who knows the ropes of the yam trade in Tonga- and
who is “in it ” in tho best sugar epees of Fiji. presides.
The Rev. Hung wears a plug bat as it can only be warn
by a Chinaman—that is, like a billy can poised on the
end of a broom-handle Hung’s auburn throat is en-
circled with a linen coiiar, size 14£, and his impressive
choker is tied for him by that promising young bud for
Heaven, Sister Honi coit qui mal y penso His coatis of
the finest clerical black cloth; and, bar the depression
on the right shoulder, where that yoke of bondage, the
bamboo, had delved its rut in the heathen days, it sits
on him as gracefully as M'Elhone's brown tweed, and
with smaller pockets. His trousers are baggy at the
knees, but this, as ho admits, has » twofold advantage.
In the first place, he can walk out with a larger patch of
dust, indicative of bis excess! 7e devotions, and in com-
bining public attention to this, his is not driven to the
shifts of certain bush missionaries in getting very long
coats to conceal hopeless dilapidation elsewhere. To
avoid threading out tho bottoms of his trousers’ logs by
getting ihem under his heels, he has adopted the Nooze
style—that is, as it threads out he turns up an inch
insic' e, and when that’s dene, another inch and so on,
until there is a fair reach of leg between the edge and
the tip of the bluoher. In his coming on the plat-
form, however, he has improved on hie teachers; for,
wher as they come on in airy freedom, aod simply
cover the gap by pulling up the hat lining that does
duty for sock, the Rev. Hung lota down the suspenders
throe holes, and the thing is dene. He has also bad the
wit to shun the Nooze affectation of one elastic side,
and one half Wellington without a heel; and bo aly
strides forward in substantial bluchers, which, although
tho toes a r e the broadest part, are at least apair. After
the venerable yam speculator has offered up a few words,
and read a few extracts from the last missionary report,
the three converts made their first appearance on the
platform. They look anxiously round for the man w.th
the match, expecting to be sworn, and determined t«
no sabee. The Rev. Hung is reputed to have catechised
them for months, and to have indoctrinated them with
sound religion, and brought them to a knowledge of
their lost condition. A few rough tests are proposed
by the Chairman, and the replies as interpreted by
Hung reflect grfat credit on tbit vessel’s teaching.
For example : Ah liooay ia asked what is the chief end
of man, acd he says “ Gat ’im plenty Chow Chow.”
Hung interprets : ' To exhibit a just contempt for the
affairs of time, and to fix onr gazo on our Heavenly
home.” “ What is the flfih commandment ?“ “Never
s ea un fowl all a samee moonlight, Engliaman too
muchfeseanm” Hung translates: “Thou shalt not
steal,” and tho christening bowl is produced. Select-
ing three Christian names from men who never heard
o? Christianity, but which are recommended on account
of their having no R in them, and thna suitable to the
thude Mongolian tongue, the following names are
washed in on top of the Ahs— Hezekiab, Melchisedeo,
and Obadlah. It is doubtful, however, whether tbo
mflno altogether takes. A a infant’s head is bald all
over, but a Chinaman can’t be baptised further than
the root of hia pig-tail. That is probably the reason
why Chinamen who turn Baptists become, through im.
mersion, more enlightened Christians than the Wes-
leyans; and carry on the fau-tan and fowl business foe
mouths and months after Hezekiah, Molchy, and Oba-
diah are doing a term for clearing their class leaders*
hen roosts. All three groan out their souls at having
been born iu Canton, and brought up in the dark pre-
cepts of Coufnoius (which is a lie, fur old Con had no
god, much less an idol), and at having smoked opium
till they could get no more. They then rejoice at com-
ing to the light ef Christianity, and mentally tot up the
lumber of peop.e before them, who wid show their
sympathy to-morrow, by buying more vegetables than
they require. A hymn expressive of the triumph of the
Gospel issuag, a prayer is offered up, and after a few
words of advice from the Rev. Unng Fat as to their
selecting a back pew near the door on Sundays, so lhat
their natural odour shall not interfere with the odour
of sanctity in pews that put half-crown into the plate—

to the night’s operations, Tho ministers shake hands
with Hong, congratulate him on his efforts, and ad-
journ to a splendid spread at Thompson’s. Hung re-
oeives two threepences from the collection plate, and
swears a grace over a sixpenny gorge at the “Earl of

LITTLE BOBBY'S HICCUP.
OUT OF IT.
[ln explanation of tho appearance of this ballad, the
editor desires to say that though he keeps several rea*
pojts on the premises, they are, for reasons which need
not be too closely gone into, not always available. There
is one upstairs now, gnawing a mutton-bone, and
labouring tho while under tho delusion that he is piping
to Gorin’s sheep in the Forest of Ardennes. We have
just paid the fine of another, who, having tho ofil itus on
him last night, struck a policeman in mistake for his
lyre. A third bard, however, looked in, and in default
of something Svinburniau or Byronio from the rest of
our poetic stall, we publish the following —Ed. B ]
It was a crowded little 'bus
That went to Surry Hills,
And five damp women soon made na
Feel sarry for our ills.
To Surry Hills we rumbled on,
When I tho faro did pay,
And 10, they talked of us in a
Most Snrryptitious way I
Tho 'bus stoppsd once, tho 'bus stopped twice,
Each time folks got in;
Tho lamps’ rajs showed then we were jammed
Like lamp rays in a tin.
Or if lampreys are not extant.
We’ll change the speci as—there 1
Say we were jammed like—well, sardines—
Most sardiaely we were!
By ’n by, there tripped a young girl in
(And so room for that fay).
We mada her, than, free of our knees,
In a free and kneezy way.
Ob, how she blushed I She was demure ;
Sat lightly on our lap ;
Ob, we'd have been chap-fallen if
We’d fallen on her chap I
They got out one by one, those damos ;
We told her who we were :
And she then uttered a light laugh.
And stared a pretty stare.
“ I’m going to your house,” she said—
At this we gave a yelp,—
,! Your missis has engaged me for
A year as lady help."
Well, since this bizarre episode.
We’ve on our luck felt down j
We’ve been quite out of spirits.
And we've been quite out of town.
\We have already made efforts, in the execution
of whieh we have strained our brain, to touch the
hearts of the people by a peculiar pathos which always
was, now is, and ever will be, distinctly our own. That
we have touched certain hearts we know ; that we have
touched many, wo believe. The former’assertion is
supported by the fact that on one day last week a dark-
whiskered gentleman, carrying a heavy blackthorn,
called in, and asked us, in a deep bass voice, for our
poet. That tuneful gentleman happening, at the time,
to be gnawing a sandwich in the front office, politely
informed the owner of the blackthorn that he was out
at present, but would return on Tuesday fortnight.
Since this our poet has been pensive (we need not say
he has been out of town), and has expressed a desire to
inaugurate a new line in poetry, of which the following
is the pioneer sample. We may remark that the pre-
sent style of pathos was originally mado popular in a
place called London by Mr. George B. Sims, author of
the " Romany-Kignold.’* We have, of course, improved
upon Mr. Sims. Anyhow, we think ao.—En. B."]
In a garret cold and gloomy, dank, and squalid, and

He was so emaciated, looked so unused to a meal,
That you really couldn’t see him when he stood up in

lu the golden sunbeams darted, shod their radiance on
that kid;
Darted through a piece of sackcloth which the broken
casement hid—
Broken was that garret window, through which flashed
tho sunbeams red :
Father out of that small casement had pitched mother
by tho head.
In the court below, tho organ welled out Bobby’s

NOT A BIT!
They wouldn’t bury Patrick Walsh —
They said it was the rule
To never pat in sacred ground
The body o! a man they found
Had sent his kids to National School.
Now Thomas Walsh is very mad.
Vows vengeance in loud tones ;
Yet by this time it does befall
Tho worms beneath tho ground do crawl
All over Patrick's bones.
Ob, we do not at Thomas soofl
In his indignant fit 1
But though he seems to cate a deal.
We most emphatically feel
That Pat don't care a bit.

Judge Pnug. of Brisbane, was slightly’ “ had,”

When Ben Franklin’s respected mother-in-law

The missionaries, hearing ot the larks their brethren

It is now a settled fact that the country editor’s
cheerful companion, the genial cockroach, will shortly
become an active agent in English medicine. In Russia
it is almost universally u-od as a diuretic in certain
complaints, and it is also frequently used in Europe as
a remedy for Bright’s disease. Its medicinal properties
strongly resemble those ot oantharides, but the social
roach always washes its feet before going to bed, and, of
course, smells twice as sweet as his garlic-chewing
Spanish cousin. Asa rule the mucilage devciuer is

Archbishop Vaughan has more grim humour
than we gave him credit for. In bidding farewell to
his flock last week, he mentioned that when he got
borne ho would take a revenge upon bis enemies ho'e by
making a pilgrimage to the abbey wherein St Argus-
tine fasted and prayed. “I will kneel diwa,” ho says,
“in that hallowed spot, and fervently beseech that
glorious apostle to touch the hearts of all hitherto op-
posed to mo, and convert them with all their wives and
families to the Cathode religion." On the face of it
i his looks like a real early Christian revenge. Therein
lies its tubtl® danger. Orangemen, beware. This is a
deep plot to lure you into the clutches of the Holy
Church and then damn you. Some sorcery has closed
the whilom sleepless eye of the Howl, or the toosin
would haye been sounded long since.
Tho Mrs. Jollebys of Brisbane aro now bursting
into enthusiasm over a “Girls’ Friendly Society,” the
object of which, we aro delighted to hear, is " to bind
together in one society ladies as associates, and girls
and young women as members, for mutual help iu load-
ing pure, useful livss.” Tnis is a consummation
devoutly to be wished, but it is to be bov>od none of tho
"young women” will presume to bo half as “pure and
useful” as tho ‘ lady” section. Furthermore, wo
learn, 11 It is is an association of persons— ladies belong-
ing to it as associates, girls and young women as mem-
bers; but all are bound together by tho tie of belonging
to the same society.” Ahem! One of the “young
persons’’ will now run down to tho chemist’s and bring
some smelling-ralts and paifumed alcoholic nerve-
reviver for the “ lady” members. Here’s half-a-oronn,

Up North, ’tis as hard to get a doctor as a
policeman when wauled. A Swoatopolis resident’s wife
took suddenly ill. Tho husband went off in hot haste
for medical assistance. The first medico ho called upon
was gone into the interior to attend a sick child; the
second was suffering from “dyspepsia; ’’ and the third
for two long hours the anxious husband knocked,
knocked, and was about to go away, disappointed, when
the door opened. “Why the devil didn’t yeu come
down before this ? Heaven knows I knocked loudly
enough." “ The fact is,” answered tho medicine man,
“I sleep over tho stable, and the horse bas a queer
habit of banging bis head against bis stall, so I thought
’twas the old moke all the time.” Next day they look

worse-half. “Right, at last I Drive straight home,

Bennett was addicted to drinking. We wonder what be
drank ? We have tried Redfern rum and Glebe gin, and
find them both parent* of bellicose thoughts and blood-
thirsty intentions. We expect rather, on this occasion,
Bennett must have mixed them. Otherwise he never,
surely, would have been so bereft of gentloiumly fool,
iug as to not only shoot his sweetheart (a thing which
many highly cultured persons have done), but to spoil
her furniture afterwards hy perfoiating 1 imseif in tho

and every workman has a respect, if not an affection,
for Ms trade. Tot he removed himself with a pistol,
without even, apparently a thought anent giving the
old shop where ho had worked a turn. This makes ns

Now the point is, could James do what ho threatens ?
We think not Pan see, so far as the law appears to bo
flipped down, the thing seems all tho other way; but,
on tho othsr hand, nothing we could hoar about the
law here would surprise ua. We know a Sydney man who
sued another for six pounds. Ho got a gfitdiot, but a
nice (1) point arising, the thing was upait, and anew
trial granted. During this period the debtor came into
some money, but his lawyer said, “ Fight it out;” and
tho creditor’s attorney wouldn't near of giving in any
price. And they fought it out. The ond was, that after
protracted litigation (during three months or iso) both
plaintiff and defendant found themselves candidates
for cheap hash. Not that the suit was over finished.
Neither could come up to the soratch for counsel’s
fees at the last trial, so the lawyers advised a com-
promieo “We like," said the junior counsel, “to sea
little affairs like those amicably settled." And no
thunderbolt came through the roof.

Sweeny, who has long been known as one o( the most
brilliant amateur batsmen over seen in the Nor’weatorn

hit at the ball in his first innings, and got nothing; and
he hit at another ball in the second innings, and still he

Pome farceur —we think we recognise the writing
of Jamas H. Rainford—has (kindly enough) sent ns a
card, which bears an invitation to festivities in these
i-oraas“ Your presence is respectfully invited to a
Complimentary Temperance Pionlo and T.uuohoon to
the members of the preps and the theatrical prefos-
slon,” This is signed W. T. Johnson. Well, we ate
very much obliged to Mr. Johnson, but wo ask him
what in thunder’s the use of inviting either scribes or
actors to anything oonnooted with temperance. Why,
we only know ena temperance actor, and that is
Sterling Whyte. And he’s not here. Wo are afraid
that we shan’t be able to go. Independently of the
pain of contemplating such of the journalistic talent
as is tent there at their meals, we are afraid that we
shouldn’t be able to trust ourselves with the Worcester
sauce.
Wo drop a silent tow as wa clip, from the
Deaths in the Lthe, the following touching obituary
poem
“ My dear Ernest, how we miss thee,
Siaoa thou art gone from here j
May bright angels watch and keep thee.
Till we come to meet you there.”
Do you think this kind of wailing
Is symbolical of grief P
And that ’twill “ oatoh on" with Ernest,
Can yon have the least belief f
How d’ you know he’s with the angels P
How d’ you know you'll ever go P
We oau’t have those things to order.
Wo poor mortals hero below I
And you’ve written such bad versa.
Gouty feet that slip and stump ;
So if o’er you fly to Ernest,
Don't yon go too near his trump !
Tfc is reported that directly Madame Bernhardt
announced her intention of publishing her memoirs,
Damala wanted to go to Africa. When ha married
Sara, ho announced through the columns of the Fiqaho
(Paris) that he would call out any person who alluded
in any way to either the “ mistakes " or to any members
of Royal or Imperial families who have raken a more
than usual interest, at times, in the Comddio Prareiise.
M. D., since he is cool with Madame, has probably dig.
covered that there are now about 20,000 skilful swords-
men waiting about to ventilate hia viscera, so he,
following up the (presumable) theory of the Duke of
Connaught and other heroes, has come to the conclu-
sion that the safest place now on earth is on the tented
field. So M. D will go to Algiers (since they won’t
enrol him as a soldier) in the capacity of a volunteer,
and bombard the Arabs with ice-creams Fancy ! even
his short marriage with Madame Bernhardt has unfitted
him for soldiering, and the doctor refuses to pass him.
What agony of mind that poor Damala must have
Buffered I
The Northern Standard (Q.) has been giv-
ing Daniel Bandmann a rough time, and says that they
have Been bettor Shylooks than hia in Townsville Now,
we don’t particularly like Bandmann, but we certainly
like him better than wo do such criticism as this. Wo
are looking forward to lively times when our old friend
arrives here. B -auiet is still with him, and as la-
fatuated (with htr art, of course) as ever. If he arrives
soon, then the city will boast two fair Louises, both of
whom are equally struok by art—
It will boaat two fair Louises, each of whom is struck
by art.
Yet woTI bet those two Louises will keep very wide
apart 1
In short, sirs, if we “ hold it ” now, we’d wager you a
crown
There’ll soaroe for those Louises be enough room in the
town!
Wo’d riddle you this mystery about these two Louises,
But are duo now at the hoatelrio whore “ whisky and a
squeeze is.”
When the enterprising burglar’s not a-burgling,
it will bo worth his while to study Edison. The latest
little baffler for Messrs. William Sykes and Co. is called
the “Warning Limp,” and consists of an adaptation
of the electric-signalling system in conned ion with a
lamp, which, to eay the least, will make things quite
unpleasant for Messieurs the burglars. This lamp ia
placed either inside or outside the premises, as pre-
ferred, and it is connected with a small battery, wires
from which are attached to doors and windows. Upon
either of these being disturbed, after the apparatus has
been set for the night and the lamp lighted, a red glass
disc is roleacod by tho aid of a small electro magnot
placed within the lamp,aind a red or danger signal is
thus given, ihe light having previously been white.
Mr. Sykes, of coarse, knows nothing of the public in-
iormation ho is giving oh himself, and after he has
earned out his felonious little plan, he returns to find
a grinning crowd of tho constabulary waiting round tho
hole to carry his bundle for him. This attention, al-
though well meant, is seldom appreoiatod by Mr. Sykes,
and as he trots along to limbo, ho looks as puzzled
and surprised as if he had just been sawn in two, or ap-
pointed Minister for Public Works.

PJ v 1 He took a pair of eighteen-guinea bag-pipes to
the house of one Hose Tout, and entertained the com-
pany with the Highland Fling. Subsequently he drank
a lot of beer out of a pewter pot,” and a little later
T*® his bag-pipes. At encampments and picnics, it has
frequently occurred hare that performers nave lost the

why we sympathise with him. But we are really in-
dined to believe m the prisoner’s innocence. “,pe was
induced to play the ‘Highland Fling,* after having been
previously persuaded to put away a considerable lot of

about the bag-pipes,” It’s sot human nature to steal
a pair of bag-pipes. It would be just as reasonable to
one would shate a thunderbolt, or “sneak”
tho one-o'olook gun. Wo would steal almost anything
ourselves, but r. pair of bagpipes would never tempt us.
And unless there was a shoulder of mutton tied, to a
tombstone, we don’t think we should even take that.
We never did like the name of Tarrabandra,
but now we hate it worse than ever. Tarrabandra, it
appears, is the home of the bloodthirsty bunyip, but
that’s not tho only trouble. It is also cursed by being
the lair of a party who lives on murderers* fcrfflns and
snake juice, and who writes nightmare rhymes over tho
mystic letters E A.S, in tho only Nojzs. “Sunset
Shadows ** is the miscreant's very latest monstrosity,
aiid he leads ctf in this wise—
“ I lean on tha outer gate
And watch tie sunset glow
Acrcss the lofty mountain.
Deep in the valley low,
Where the rushing Tumnt Eiver
Is winding darkly by ;
Where oft is heard by midnight
The mystic buayip’e cry,”
This requires explanation, because if tho “glow”
is in “ tha valley low,” and there’s a lofty mountain
between the *■ outer gate ” and the aforesaid valley, how
in brimstone and sulphur can tho bard see the glow
through the mountain P EA 8. is quite sure about
the bunyip business, hewever, for he winds up by a
blood-curdling wail about
“ That darkly secret river
Where the dreaded bunyip hides,
And tho misty shadows steal
Par up the mountain sides.
As soon as he has dene cutting bark, the Tarrabandra
bard promises to let us have a “node” on the
“ Gohanua’s Gory Grave;” but in tha meantime It is to
be sincerely hoped the “mystio bunyip” will rush along
with the river and chew up his poet.
We wore always of opinion that tho funniest
items out were the sentimental verges ef tho immortil
poet 6laden, but these are totally eclipsed by the
essthetio Alfred’s “kritoek” thereon. First of all, we
are told that the Victorian Milton's last atrocity con-
tains “a number of lyrics devoted to tho praise of
female lone iness and witchery, to which most poetic
natures are peculiarly sensitive.” Alf, of course,
speaks from tad experience. As the boarding-school
gul oaoe wrote, “ tfie Pangs ov Luv are grate, 1 have
been thire myself,” so, also, out of the fulness of his
heart, this Maoaulay-lito “cricket” speaks. Wo ore
next told: “The printing of the volume is excellent;
volume itself is thin M This comes of oonMaiog
one’s criticisms to the subject of monster pumpkins,
and judging poetic works by the same standard.
Luckily, Alfred could only find space for one gem—
“ Lady Hamilton’s lament for tho death of Nelson.”
“ Tho Bard,” sajs the Pltt-street Eiia—and mark that
honoured term again—“the Bard causes her to describe
the loss which England suffered by her hero’s death."
And then Lady Ham. lets out on her own responsibility
in tho following beautiful lines, which hop along like a
bob-tailed kangaroo over a ploughed paddock i
" He was my king, my Alexander,
My seamen Pericles;
And, but for him, my fame were dim.
And my cap thick with lees."
Mr. Sladen is one of the .very few poets who have suc-
ceeded in running 3ft. 6in. into one lino of verse, and
balancing it off with another line which only holds 18in.
And jet, as tho only Alfred says: “ There is ‘heart’
in these versos, and they no doubt express the senti-
ments whioh poor Lady Hamilton felt when she lost
her illustrious lover." Perhaps so; but, if they do, she
mast have i bought as much about her “Pericleos" as
she would of a pot cockatoo, or her “ nigger ” footman.
Alf. is right. The volume ie “too thin.”
Wo have been forwarded a poem by an
ex-Attorney-Qeneral, “On the Dsath of a Friend."
The author, we find to our surprise, to be a first-class
third class poet. He has a lot-of genuine feeling, bat
“•rather too much addicted to talking about heaven, of
which, as ho is out of office, ho can’t expect to know
much at present. Tho poem is printed on cardboard,
like an almanac or a benefit show ticket, and is datad
Feb 1859. Here goes for some of it
“ ‘ Whom the gods love,’ they say, ‘ die young
To them is given
T’ endure the ills of life not long.
Free from earth’s heaven ;
While they whose • hearts are dry as dost,’
Wordiings live on—they rot and rust—
Thou wer’t amongst the pare and just I
And called to heaven
This, of course, is utterly unallowable ; but there are
some nice touches in other portions of the piece, whish
is of considerable length. For instance
“ The gloomy cypress shadows now
Thy house;
Smitten with Anguish lieth low
Thy widowed spouse;
Thy little child who olimbed thy knee,
Aud prattled there in infant glee,
Alas, now vainly seeketh thee
Through that lone house.”
Thus Mr. Wisdom. Well, it is rather pleasant for ns
to discover that Bob has got a touch of the Parnassian
measles. We should like to hear from him again. Hia
friends can’t be always dying, so lot us have a metrical
recipe for flaa-annihilator, or an ode to the Groat
I WAS,
Stupidity must certainly be hereditary. Look
at that feeble child of the Hum, the bbeoud, for
instance. We were confirmed In this theory by chancing
to look into a late number of the Gentleman s Mag a-
zinjs, in which is a paper by kylvanus Urnan aboat
Australian and African Explorations by means of
balloons We have nothing to say about the subjiot of
the paper, but the style is of that ponderously playful
kind which we thought hod died out with the heavy
humorists of a century ago. The Gentleman's
Magazine is the patriarch of periodical literature at
homo. It was always so dull that it seemed to have beon
bciu dumb, deaf, and blind. “ Sylvanus Urban” is the
hereditary uom de plume of tha editor. The editor of
hie time offended Tom Hood, and so became the subjeot
of one of the bittereet satires ever wiitteu, Just then a
senes of antiquarian sketches dealing with the various
churches m London were appearing in the Magazine,
bo Hood begins:—
“Oh, Mr. Urban, never must Ihou lurch,
A sober age made serious drunk by thee ;
Hop in thy pleasant way from church io church.
And nurse thy little bald biography.”
We will hick tha line we have italicised against any one
in the whole range of satirioal verse for concentration
of meaning and felicity of expression. Again i—
“ Eich is thy page in soporific things—
Composing compositions—lulling men—
Faded old posies of uuburied rings
Confessions dozing from an opiate pen.”
Is it possible that Hood, when writing this verse, fore-
saw, in some mysterious manner, the advent of the
Sheocd? If so, he must have died happy, knowing
that it was the dead on the other Bide of the world who
would suffer. And this verse ie superb
“ The sacred query—the remote response—
The march of serious mind, extremely slow •
The graver’s cut at some right-agoi sconce, *
Famous for nothing, many years ago !’’
The first two lines here one might almost imagine aimed
at Alfred’s “Answer to Correspondents" man, only
that we know the latter to have been lying in his
father's shoe when Hood flourished. Lastly, tow is
the seeond line of the following two for a concise
crusher f
Go on I and thrive I Demurest of odd fellows.
Bolting up dullness in an anoient bin 1
And yet the Gentleman’s Magazine lives, and, in a
kind of a stolid way, thrives; while Hood is dead, and
except by the few, forgotten. When Alfred, whose
culture nobody will have the hardihood to question,
was asked who Hood was, he scratched his head with
hie facile pen a minute, murmured something like
“Grandmother, what a large month you have,” atd
then, brightening up, replied with vivacity: •• Whv
cert’nly; Little Ead Hiding Hood I" Suoh is fame.
We always said it! From the first day we read
Farkes’a “Murmurs of the Stream," we know the
example sot by the author of these magnificent poems
would lure some young man to destruction. And it has

TO A POET.
Long years ago, when Sappho sing
And Maro touched the magic lyre,
And as the splendid strain outraug
A universe it set on fire,
'Twas never thought on Ihee would fall
The cloak of poesie at all.
*Twas sever thought that as the stream
Went rippling on it# gentle coib-ho,
Tlio world would wako u« from a Jicaui
And recognise thy magic force—
That thou all poeta would defy,
And sat on them thine " Ivo Biigh I"
Yet famous as thou art, this thought
Must haunt, O bard, thy teeming brain :
The wretched lad above has caught
Thine own more than Homeric strain.

Furthermore, he was incessantly urging his uncle (who

It seems difficult to define what constitutes dis-
yalty and treason. In the course of last autumn, a
mug lady, resident in one of the principalities of
orth Germany, inatruoted a solicitor to take measures
ir compelling the reigning Prince to contribute
) ward a tho support of her child npon the ground that
a (the Priuoe) was the father of it. The Prince denied
ie paternity ; thereupon tho solicitor applied to the
ourt for leave to have his client put upon her oath in
rder that she might prove the truth of her assertions.
'or this oileuce, which the tribunal classed as high
reason, the solicitor has been sentenced to six months
uprisonment. They manage things batter in England.
r ejh sap,
A firm which formerly employed a large number
t men in Sheffield, a! year ago closed their works
here, and have now opened a large factory in America.
Ir. Mandella, M.P., moved his factory from Notting-
iam, where the factory hands worked nine hours a day,
o Saxony, where the people work thirteen hours a day,
ad then ho paid the Saxons one-third less wages than
ie gave the Nottingham operatives, and undersold
he Nottingham manufacturers In their own market.
‘Yet,’* says an English paper, •'the working men are
o wilfully blind that they cannot see that this class of
nen, whom they return to Parliament, are the very
nen who ate taking the broad out of them moulhs.”
The Tories have been rubbing in Forster’s
1 complicity " fid a good deal deeper than even tin
Whigs who cheered the ex-Chief Secretary s attack
ipon Mr Parnell and other Land League leaders in
’arliam mt relish. Q noth the Dispatch The vucil-
ationof tho Government in this matter affords a slender
-a very slender —?xouse for the factious way in which
he Opposition is trying to prejudice some members of
he Cabinet, and to implicate them in Mr. Parnell s and
he Laud League's pretended connection with Mr
Sheridan and the Dublin assassins. It is a house of
lards that with SiijStatford Northoote’s sanction Mr.
Jorst and other Tory Irreconoilablea are fond of build-
ing up over and over agaii, and they built it up with
such great and misspent ingenuity.**
Our countrymen at home are by no means quite
so complacently thankful to Providence for the abun-
dance of Eoyal babies which has been showered on cur
country. If this continues m ’ch longer, remarks a
Loudon paper, there will scon be a scarcity of palaces
wherein to house all the royal flock, and a dearth ef
places wherewith to tinder their lives easy and comfoit
able at the public expense. Tho birth of another
princess on Sunday certainly cannot under any circum-
stance be styled an antpioioua event. Only a few weeks
back the Duchess of Connaught increased the royal
family, and at the same time the national burdens, at
Windsor Oastlo. She then made way for the Duchess
of Albany, who on Sunday last did the same. And new
the papers inform ns that the Lncheas of Edinburgh is
on her road homo for the purpose of performing the
principal part in another of these “happy events.”
What a loyal and contented people we ought to be!
Trua that in Ireland tho blessing of h.ving so prohflo a
family on the throne seems scarcely appreciated. The
Irish complain that they want food, but when they ask
for bread a fresh baby is all that is forthcoming. That
these royal presentations do not bring plenty and glad-
neas to the hearths of many is pretty evident.
The resistance by the industrious classes to the
diroot plunder—not to speak of the indirect—wrung
from them on false pretences by the powerful, becomes
more intense and widespread every year The people
everywhere begin to declare that since they pay the
wages of their monarohs, it is for them and not for the
monarch or a subservient clique to fix the value of the
services rendered Wo are told by London papers that
a nnmbar of English Radicals will protest in future
against any further increase in the royal gran's, and
lhat pensions aro to be cut down. We also lesrn that
the stand made by a handful of members about the
Royal Yacht motion is tho beginning of the end ; and
that at last a vigorous attempt is to be made to curtail
tho huge allowance wrung from poverty for the support
of tho powerful. Then, again, in Norway the same
spirit is active. “The new Norwegian Storthing,
which has recently been opened, is likely to prove quite
as stormy as some of its predecessors. The last Fulfil-
ment was closed with one of the most angry Royal
speeches on record ; but the Opposition has taken its
revenge by returning a larger Liberal majority than
ever, and the new deputies seem disposed to exuhange
the whips of their j'redooessors for scorpions of thoir
own. Tho last Storthing refused to veto an inoreaso to
tho Crown Prince's allowance on tho oeeasi >n of hia
marriage, bat there is now a talk of carrying the war
into the King’s own purse, and of reducing by one-flftb
his already very modest civil list of some £25,000/’
In the adjourned debate on the Address, Mr.
Parnell moved an addendum, to the effect that; the
Crimes Act had been administered in Ireland in a
tyrannical and unjust manner, that constitutional
agitation was despotically impeded and persecuted, that
justice was administered in a most partial and preju-
diced spirit, that a system of jury packing had led to
many iniquitous sentences and the execution of innocent
persons, while it was practically impossible fo obtain
justice or protection for the masses o?. the people from
the present, administration of the law, aid thtt unless
the Irish Executive abandoned unconstitutional and
tyrannical courses, and depended upon the constitu-
tional administration of the ordinary law, the result
might be prejudicial in an extreme degree to the cause
of peace and order. In the discussion which followed,
Justiu McCarthy, M P , made a striking point, and
showed that in 18:4 Mr. Forster had been accused both
ia the House and in the newspapers of conniving at
assassination. Mazzini had written a letter entitled
“ The btory ef the D iggor,” in which the patriot said,
“ Blasted be the knife, blessed be the dagger; and
talked ci these instruments as weapons of “irregular
warfare.” This letter was read in the House, where
upon the member for Bradford rose and said, "Mkzzini,
whatever his faults, is a man of high character, and I
shall not bo ashamed of being his friend.” Thera were
triumphant cheers as Mr, M'Carthv proceeded with
his exposure, while Mr. Forster looked red and rumpled,
and at times turned in nervous impatience to mate
some explanatory remark to Mr. Bright, who sat on the
end bench near him.
There is an imaginary conversation between a
Whig reor, and a Kadieal M P. in Macmillan s for
March, which is very clever and very prop no tic. The
Whig Lord thus describes Gladstone Gladstone has
a foot in every camp, even the camps ho is supposed to
have left He is loved by Churchmen and worshipped
by Dissenters; followed by Jingoes and supported by
q lakers ; obeyed by me, superetiliously deferred to by
you. He holds with poifect consistency the most irre-
concilable opinions, and advocates with conclusive
logic the most obutrudiotory policies. Ha can employ
people to act for him without making them bis agents.
Ha can treat with people without entering into a treaty.
Ha can conduct a campaign without going to war. Ha
can silence his opponents in the name of liberty. He
can imprison Irishmen, and call it a policy ‘if concili-
ation ; disarm them, and call it a message of pea.ee. He
ciin denounce a course which aimed at protecting the
iiflhresbd of England in the East, and then protect our
interests in Egypt to the exclusion of those of Franco,
with the utmost d sinterestsdnaas, If ever there was a
heaven bora Minister, it is he. My dear Corkhonse,
persuade him to wear a greatcoat; for after him the—
Tories.” Again, the same speaker remarks “ ’i ho re-
lations between Whigs and Eadica : s between you and
me, for instance—is bo peculiar, that it requites a
peculiar loader in order to conceal the peculiar!' y. The
art of Government consists iu talking finely and acting
sans bly. Usually, you Eadioala do the (ine talking, the
bsautiful sentiments, the fhsh and blood, and rights of
man business. We Whig* do the sensible deeds, intro-
duco Coercion Bills, shoot down the Egyptians, and
pass ths c oinre. Our Grand Old Man does both Iho
Toiies! wuat fools they are 1 both act sensibly and
talk sensibly ; and flesh and blood cannot bo expected
to stand that Wo denounce extravagant expenditure,
and so can increase the income tax They defend what-
ever expenditure'!* necessity, and, therefore, reap no
advantage by reducing it. We protest against war as
wicked, and can therefore afford to bombard Alexandria,
capture Cairo, and make Wolsoley a peer."
The organa of property united in one tremendous
hollow that Famed’a reply to Forster was a failure, and
even particularised his contention that juries woio
packed as one of the points on which ho failed to make
an impression. There is no daubt that Mr. Parnell did
fail to make an impression on the House of Commons
as a whole. It is evident that had he been inspired to
deliver a message from Heaven, couched in the logic of
the Almighty, be would have failed just the same to
convince the collection of aristocrats, landlords, and
plutocrats who pretend to represent the people of
England in the Mouse of Commons. But just read
what ho did say on this one head, and, as we have done,
turn it over in your mind, and ees whether you think it
a failure to demonstrate that juries arc packed in Ire-
land to a degree which constitutes a wrong and a legit i-
mats grievance “ For seven trials there had been a
panel of 20 J jurors, and from the panel tho Crown
selected flfty-six, forty-seven of whom were Protestants,
nine oaly being Catholics. The proportion of Catholics
to Protestants on the jury panel of 200 was just the
other way, the proportion of Catholics being four and a
half to one Protestant. (Irish cheers.) The farce cf
saying that the Government wished by not constituting
a tribunal of j udges to pre serve the right of trial by j ury
did not deceive anybody. There was no such thing in
Ireland as trial by jury, There was trial only by
tribunals of partisans.” Next note this sentence from
Mr. Trevelyan's speech in reply to the above, aid say on
which side the disloyalty to constitutional rights and
absolute disingenuousness lay. Quoth Mr. Jrevelyan :
“ It was necessary to have on me j ary men of high
intelligence and of good social position. It
was the anxious desire of the Crown that there
should be no distinction on religious grounds"
It will be observed that the Under Secretary for Ireland
actually spits in the face of the Great Charter, one of
the most vital provisions in which ia that a man shall
be triad by his peers—that is to say by his equals. Once
there is a return to the commencement of King John’s
reign for constitutional practice, and admit the max m
that only men of “good social position” are to be
| admitted as jurymen, we re- open the doer to class domi-
nation, A Minister or official who made such a deola-
ration deserved impeachment as a traitor to the
Constitution. Fat tho cablegrams to these colonies
brought no announcement that the House of Girnmoas
was “disgusted" with Mr. Trevelyan who thus belie 1
the Constitution. Wo had advice, instead, that the
House was “disgusted” with Pam-ill, who denounced a
clear breach of one of the most sacred entrenchments
of public liberty. By tho way, a noal comment ary on
the question whether Mr. Parnell " failed ” to demon-
strate a real grievance with respect to packed juries is
furnished by the determination cf the United States
Government; nob to surrender Sheridan without full
proof of his guilt, and a guarantee for an impartial jury
trial. It is a curi us loot (hat the United Ssatei
Goveminent, with all tho particulars before it that the
British Government could muster, has not yet allowed
I that there ia full proof of his guilt; while the S.M.
HiiaALD, with its tx parte yarns from “ our own oorrea-
pondent,” and tho i imes correspondents in Ireland,
who are “ Castle ” officials, and in America, Is perfectly
certain that Sheridan is guilty.
A storm of indignation has been aroused among
the working classes of G.ieat Britain by a discovery than
tlia Government authorised the expenditure of no less a
sum than £55,000 for repairs to tho Victoria and Albert,
one of the Queen's yachts. The lickspittle London
Times and other tim i-sorvicg dailies have of course
nothing to say. But the weeklies which circulate
among the people and ex.rt far more real influence on
ths inevitable future guidance of affairs, are not to
mealy-mouthed. This is how one paper which has a
circulation six times greater than The Times and that
too among the clesi who are gaining, not the castes
which are losing, power—deals wuh the matter:— ‘ 1 ha
present ia, perhaps, as good an opportunity as we shall
find for inqu ring into the cost of royal yachts. The
Queen has four placed at her disposal by the nation.
The annual cost of these to the taxpayers is over £25,000,
more than twice the sum annually allowed to the Pi evi-
dent of tho Unite! States for his entire maintenance.
The details are as follows Annual pay of the officers
and crew of ths Victoria and Ab ort, £8333; ditto Os-
borne, £SCOO; ditto Alberta,T2ooo; di-.to Elfin, £B3O ;
pay of men m Portsmouth Hook) ard for tho time t hey ar u
employed on royal yachts, £9)O0 —total £25,168 But
this expenditure does not include extraordinary repairs,
c ial, or interest on capital sunk. If we reckon the last
at half a miPion, and ths rate of interest at five per
cent., we have another £25,C00 annually. We cannot,
than, be far wide of the mark if we assert that the
annual cost to the country for royal yachts alona is
close upon £30,000. This, it will b> admitted, is a piece
of c x ravaganoe and waste for which there ia no manner
of excuse ” *Vo find u lot more to tho same effect
scattered through the People's papers. It appears that;
contrary to the custom in tho Navy, tno effljers and
cre w of tha Victoria and Albert are retained on full pay
while the ship is laid up. Then again the Osborne,
I another ©f these expensive and all but useless vessels,
so tar as real werk gees, has just undergone an extern
sive r.flt and embellishing, an! “ was yotterday,declared
fi; for active service. By the middle of tha mouth, too,
the Alberta was to have her defects remedied in order
to be iu attendance cu her Majesty during her stay at
Osborne." In other words, during the present year,
over a hundred thousand pounds have been expended iu
three vessels, none of which make, as a rule, more than
a dozen trips the seison. And here attain >8 tho tone of
a most powerful Kaiioal paper:—* A wilder or more
ridiculous addition to the public burdens of tho la a
could not be imagined. If the Queen needs a steam
wherry to dance attendance on the Isle ol Wight, le.
tho Qaeon pay for tho luxury out of her own pocket. If
she did this, eha might have, not one, but fifty of those
really utclots vessels. To saddle tho funds, however,
with the ooac of yaohts which are but seldom used, and
to saddle the country, too, with such vast sums as tr.e
amounts already named, shows plainly that the Cop,
laons are most negligent in their duties. A suiot
national auditor could never pass so wasteful a piece of
extravagant pride." “Doling the pas.
twelve months’ so far as tho revenue returns ft the
States go, their vast national debt has been lesaoieu by
about fifty millions. At a rata like this, even our
horrible weight of taxation, so far as the national del t
goes, would no clean swept away. Do we try to moke
this clearance P Not a jot. Endesa Quean a yatchts,
and one thing or another of tho same kiad, like hungry
hounds iace santly eitrour increase up " It is an organ
of the English .people also which remarks that wnea
tho Irish road in tno papers that although there are
four royal yachts already i 1 the disposal of tho royal
family, a turn of between forty and fifty thousand
pounds is to ha expended in repairing another, they
may think that whilst their own country people are
living, or rath-r dying, upon soiweed, such an outlay
upon a royal plaything seems, cruel, callous, wasteful,
and wicked 1

The Oxford and Cambridge boat race was rowed
on the 15th March, and, contrary to expectations, was
won by the Oxford crew. The betting was much in
favour of Cambridge, but Harry Kely, W. J. Jones
(Hanlau's chief backer), and a few other good judges
predicted Oxford would do the trick. The race was
started at half-past five. Oxford at once took the lead,
and when half the course had been covered a blinding
snowstorm came on which completely hid the crews
from view. Towards the finish of the race it cleared
off, and it was seen that the Oxonians had a lead of four
lengths, which they maintained to the finish. Time,
2lmin. 18see.
At Wanganui (N.Z.), the other day, a certain
gentleman scratched his horse for the Cup, and the
proceeding being discussed on the grandstand, his
mother overheard the remarks about her son’s horse
being “ scratched." The old lady was very indignant,
and said the horse was not scratched, for she had
noticed in the morning that there was not a soar or
blemish of any kind on it, from its head to its feet.
However, to make sure, she sallied forth to the saddling
paddock to see for herself. She examined the horse
critically with her umbrella, and in such a fashion as to
Induce the steed to kick out his heels, capsizing the old
lady and crushing all her millinery.

The N.S.W. Rowing Association cannot be con-
gratulated on the reception given to the Victorian crew
at the Bedfern Station. Only eight rowing men put in
an appearance: Messrs M’Leod, Coles, Keddia, Brett,
Bros, Rich, lokerson, and Haslingden. The hon. see.
of the Association buttonholed Mr. Upward, and left
the rest of the N. S. Woles men to gain an introduction
as best they could. After some delay at the station,
Mr. Coles led the way to the corner of Pitt and George
streets, to await a tram, which did not show up for fully
fifteen minutes —pretty rough on eight men with train-
ing appetites and jnst off a long journey. Had we known
the Association could not afford the hire of a ’bus, we
would willingly have used our potent influence with the
Governor of Darlinghurst for the loan of Black Maria,”
—and, judging from a remark made by a facetious mem-
her of the Melbourne craw, a still less saveury vehicle
would have been acceptable to the “ gumsuckers.”
The Australasian received the following
polito note from an Oxford University man Oxford,
Oriel Coll., March4.—Sir, As I have only just seen
your number of January 13, may I be excused for being
so late in remarking that it is like your d —d Austra-
lian conceit to state that the Hon. Ivo Bligh’s team, at
present in Australia, is an eleven of * representative
English cricketers.’ It is quite possible (and I should
be most happy to do so myself) to raise at least two
elevens capable of boating the present English Eleven
on its return to England. I am glad to see, though,
that in the second and third matches with Murdoch’s
team the English Eleven has taught the colonials that
they are not the best cricketers in the world (as they
are inclined to believe), though they may have beaten
a ’representative team of English cricketers ’ when
they had the elements so strongly in their favour,—l
remain, sir, your obedient servant, O. U. C. C." The
Oxonian takes his gruel very badly indeed.
Raynor has written the following letter to the
Melbourne Sportsman Sir, Will you kindly give
publicity to the following few lines for me:—l am a
long-distance pedestrian, and desirous of showing the
public I can hold say own with either Mr. O’Leary or
Edwards. I therefore am willing to accompany them
in the next six days’ and nights’ walking match to take
place in Sydney, commencing the 30th of April. As
Messrs. O'Leary and Edwards objected to make a
sweepstake of the match that took place last month in
Sydney, perhaps they will allow me to walk under the
following condition in the event of my winning
I receive nothing; and while on the track to always
koap the outside walking, so as not to interfere with
either of tho above-named pedestrians. I might also
mention, Mr. Editor, that I will give any man twenty
miles’ start in a six days' and nights’ go-as-you-please
raoe. I shall continue to claim my right to the title of
champion long-distance rqnner and walker of the Aus-
tralian colonies, until fairly dispossessed —John Eat
nbr, 48-hour’s Champion, 13th April, 1883.”

The pigeon-match recently shot at Louisville,
U. 8., between the well-known shots, W. P. Carver and
A. H. Bogxidus, 100 birds at thirty yards’ rise, for
£lOO, resulted in a win for Carver, who killed 83 birds,
one more than his adversary. The contrast between
the two principals in personal appearance was striking.
Bogardushas the appearance of a well-to-do, careless
sort of a country gentlemen, and wore a suit of black,
with a dark-blue shirt and slouch hat. He has very
prominent cheek bones, with rough features, a heavy
red moustache, and is of a rather retiring disposition.
When preparing for the contest ho took off his coat,
tucked his pantaloons in his boots, and pulled his soft
hat over his eyes. His adversary is a second edition of
Buffalo Bill, and sported an immense white hat, a pair
of long-top boots, and a heavy overcoat with seal-
skin trimming. Under this ho had s dark blouse and
pants. He is a*• strawberry blonde," is of tall stature,
and possesses a very jaunty air. He is inclined to speak
rather eloquently of his own achievements, and at the
hotel registers himself as the champion wing-shot of
the world.
The annual meeting in connection with the
Bathurst Picnic Racing Club was held on Mr John
M’Phillamy’s ground. Mount Tamar, on Saturday last.
The entries were confined to members' horses, the
riders were all amateurs, and Messrs. George Lee and
Sydney Smith acted as judge and starter respectively.
The ball opened with tne Maiden Plate, which fell to
Freedom; Hereford, halt a nock cfl, second; Harlequin
third. The Challenge Cup was wan hy Mr. W. Loo’s
(juair ) gelding. Schemer, Fandango second, and Larri-
kin third. Mr. Leo has won the CUp twice in succes-
sion, and becomes the permanent holder. Veloutine
made an easy win of the Mount Tamar Cup, Starline
second, Hussar third. The Voluntary Handicap was
appropriated by Elastic, who beat Queen Bertha by a
length, Hereford third. Schemer romped in the winner
of the Ladies* Bag, Fandango second, Freedom third.
The Burraga Cup was won by Starline, Elastic second,
Mystery third. Veloutine won the Ladies’ Bracelet,
Hussar second, and Einglike third; and a most plea-
sant day’s sport was brought to a termination by a
pony race, which was won by Logic.
On Saturday afternoon both the Intercolonial
Eight-oar crews did a spin for the edification of a num-
ber of visitors who went up the river in a launch hired
by the Bowing Association. The Victorians, who
showed first, are a fine, powerful lot of men, and seemed
to get pace out of their boat, but they are mot to be
compared for form with the New South. Welshmen, who
rowed as one man. Mr Oatley deserves a lot of credit
for the manner in which he has coached his crew, and
it really seems a pity he had not better material—as
far as weight was concerned—to work npou. Should
next Saturday prove boisterous, the Sydney men’s
style ought to pull thorn through j but, in the event of
a calm day, which should be looked for at this time of
the year, the raoo, whichever way it goes, ought to
prove one of the best yet seen bn the Parramatta
River. Subjoined are the names and weights of the
two crews. Victorian: J D. Brown, 10 st 6 lb; W. W.
Senior, 10 st; W. Leverett, list 31b; J. D. Webster,

On sth February, at Madden’s boxing-show, at Sheffield
(Eng.), Charles Mitchell, champion, and Tug Wilson
agaiu met, and their enoounter is thus described in
Sporting Life:— ‘ They sparred for a minute; then
Wilson dashed out his left on the chest twice heavily,
which brought about merry exchanges. Both were very
cautious afterwards, Wilson mostly acting on the defeu-
»ive. A good rush on the part of Mil chell closed the
first round. In the second Wilson sent in the left on
the body, and was countered on the head heavily. Mit-
chell got his right wall home on the body without a
return, and he also had the best of a short rally. In
the third round both were busy. Tug dasbed out his
left once or twice, but was short, and the round finished
with a short rally, in which Mitchell forced Wilson to
the ropes." George Hazael, the famous English
pedestrian, and the only man who has left behind his
flyiag and persistent feet the great score of six hundred
miles in six days, has decided to reside permanently in
New York A. swindling dodge has come to light in
connexion with the enclosed system of coursing in Eng-
land. A couple of men ran several dogs at the Haydook
Park meeting, not one of which raised a flag, being in
every instance led the length of a street, the owners, of
course, laying odds against them. This is what is tech-
nically known as *• stuffing." The matter was brought
before the National Coursing Club, with the result that
both men ate banished from every qoqraing field.
A Tale of the Bash.
Ik waa twenty years last autumn since my commie
and 1
Started westward for the “ Comet," after doing a heavy
fly
Round Rockhampton’s •* pubs.” and “ sing-songs," and
tbe other joyous places
Where the bashman “ lambs” his shearing cheque, and
airs his little graces.
And two genuine “ stone-brokers” we went swagging it
along,
With our horses down our throats—gold to Pasooe for
a song—
I may hero remark that Pasooe has "gone over" years
ago.
But ahthia time ran agrog mill on the main track to and
fro—
From the Dawson and the Comet, and the farther
western plains.
And took horses for "agistment,” which I found out,
to my pains.
Meant a bottle of bad brandy, just to close account.-!,
when going.
And a hope expressed that next time we’d remember
what waa owing.
Well, wo tramped and starved together, till the Daws' u
lay behind.
And the stations spread out wider, and ’twas precious
hard to And ,
Tea and sugar from one evening to hold out the follow-
ing day—
Not to speak of beet and damper—as we trudged along
the way.
Then it came about, one sundown, that we lost the
bloomin’ track,
And, in vain attempts to strike it, on our loss came
circling back.
Until Joe (my mate), disgusted, slung his swag beneath*
a tree.
Saying “ Right here I doss till morning—yew kin walk
all night far me."
Peeling somewhat riled at this speech—seeing that I o
had led the way,—
The narrator spread his blankets half a dozen role
away j
And in silent, supperleas, sulky, out-of-sorts condition,
Breathed a bitter prayer, consigning grog, dice, women
to perdition.
Then I slept, and sleeping dream’d of days that ne’er
will come again ;
Days whose lingering memory now is less a pleatme
than a pain j
Days when life was pure and hopeful, and the very stars
seemed mine 1
Now astronomy of this sort is, alas 1 not in my lino.
In the day-break I was wakened by a crash of falling
timber,
And a ory that to my dying day my brain will still
remember.
Past beneath the fallen gum-tree Yankee Joe imprisoned
lay.
With enough of life loft In him just to keep despair
away.
Vain my straggles to release him. What availed my
single strength
With the fallen forest giant, stretching in its massy
length P
While my comrade of past shearings bore his agony and
pain
Without murmuring, without flinching, till ho saw my
efforts vain.
Then he speke 11 Mata, don’t you leave me in this bloody
bush to die
Inch by inch in misery; take and put a bullet through
my eye.
God be thank’d yon got a charge left in jour’shooter’;
take good aim,
And from this darn j ammin’ free me ; I for you would
do the same."
Now, considering the position, you’ll admit ihe fix was
queer,
And that one thing with another I’d an awkward course
to steer.
Off the track, and miles from snooonr, and our water
nearly done.
It came forcibly upon mo that my old mate’s course was
ran.
Once again I fiercely struggled with that unrelenting
tree;
Onoo again sank down exhausted ere the prisoner was
free;
Then despairingly I 000-oed, while the wild bush echoed
back
With a sound of mocking laughter, as If fiends were c n
our track.
Was it crime, or only mercy ? God knows what was
the intent.
One more reckless life was ended .when that bullet’s
foroe was spent.
Dead beneath the fallen monarch, oenotaph’d from
storm or shine;
Tojeoal that spirit parted gladly had I yielded mine!
Hanger, thirst, despair and madness seized me as I fled
away.
Succour found me naked, raving, sobbing, cursing,
trying te pray.
And, tho‘ since that time of horror twenty years have
oome and gone,
Seared upon my heart for ever its dread memory lives
on.

April to Mr. F A. Cooper, barrister, and member of the

piuoe at Mr. Watson's residence, and the display of

With a long court train, very much draped, terminating

toast Of the "Three Professions," given by the Chair-
man, was acknowledged by Mr. Barton (legal), Drs.
M'Kellar and Brereton (medical), and Rev W, Curnow,
Messrs. Ward and Hutchinson (j curnalis’ic) Mr.
Curnow’s speech on the Prose was a most effective one.
After fanoifnlly describing the ideal newspaper, which
never was and never will be, he said: "Newspapers
as they were, were about enough for the capa-
city of ordinary mortals. The pressman of the
day was expected to know everything, and to
be always ready to write ©n everything. He had to
dabble in literature, in politics, in science; to bo familiar
with faiths and with unfaiths, Nothing that was
human must be foreign to him ; nothing that is super-
human must bo beyond hia boat. For ethers there may
be a time for silence; for him it is always a time to
speak. Others could be silent in half-a-dozen lan-
guages ; ho was expected to bo vocal in muoh mere than
that number of subjects. He had to be wise, or to
appear to b© wise, in whatever pertained t» the earth
beneath, or the waters under the earth ; and with the
wisdom of Solon, he was expected to combine the meek,
ness «f Moses and the patience of Job.” (Laughter and

From a loading London journal, it seems there
is an outcry about logs. Wo ere told wo Lava too inucb
of them at theatres. So wo have-not because the exhi-
bition is indecent, but because it is ugly. What a
woman is expected to hide or show is purely a matter
of convention. A Turkish girl won’t, for the world, let
her face be seen; bat she will raise her wide trousers
much above the bare knee in a man's pretence, and be
unconscious of impropriety, aler Englith sister will
go to a ball with neok and arms bare; or, to put it more
currently, with about a quarter of her body concealed
only by shoulder-straps. In Europe uecka, shoulders,
backs and busts are shown; in the Orient, legs; and in
the Faoitio. lad lor of the Hiio walk about like Eve be-
tare the fall As the poet say a,
’Tis wall, it smacks of Eden ereoama siu in.
Or anv rag of dbasciousness, or linen.
Or anything that one could stick a pin in.
Now, at the theatres only a few years ago, ballot-girls
used to wear skirts which came down a little below the
knees. These skirts woio made of muslin, and there
were so many of them t hat when their wearers wore
dancing they lo ked like a olond. The effect was pretty
nud graceful, hut the cloud has disappeared in favour
of a small piece of silk fitting tightly to the figure, and
the result is exceeding ugliness.. As a rule, thin anus
me in thin logs ; jet a glance at the modern ballot-girl
show* that though her arms may bo sticks, her legs are
more or less plump. This is because she pads the
latter and cannot pad the former. This is how it is
done; ike shape of her leg is taken, and then a pair of
tigbta is made, with wool woven into them as the case
may require. A girl with her legs done up in cotton
woo , with a small piece of silk nrawn tightly ia by a
band, and with naked arms ai d shoulders cannot bo
ttlid to bo making an indecent * xhibition of herself, but
«!i«h ungainly She shocks no morality, but she docs
shock good taste.

often lands u.a new made husband and wife in debt at

economy, and sweet simplicity in the new programme:
—" No cake, no cards, no anything but nyum-nyam I”
In the Hereford Times, of Fab-nary 24, waa
the following advertisement; —“Ann Jones wants vo
sell her child (alittle girl); it is twelve months old;

A young lady named M'Oormiok, living at!
Kaitaugata (Ocago, N.Z ), got up a report that she had
been poisoned by eating a tart. On analysis, it was
found to contain alum, but inquiries showed that Miss
M'Cormiok cooked the tart, herself, out it, and laid it
on the table. It is believed that she placed the alum
in the tart herself, and feigned illness with a view of
eliciting sympathy from a young man who waa present.
On visiting a lunatic asylum near Paris, Sara
Bernhardt took a freak to do a little rehearsal. Arriv-
ing at an empty cell, she proceeded to play the lunatic
with horrible realism. She rolled oa the bed, shrieked
incoherent words, made frightful grimaces, and finally
pulled frantically at the bars of the window. It ia sup-
posed she is ambitions of repreienting madness on the
stage more fatefully and wonderfully than it has been
represented before.

some spiteful old “pc ay” hoists a few of them over

a calf goes nosing about his mistress s haais in search
of sawdust. The cows are quise tco awfully lovely, als»,

a tnuio, quite short, of striped black velvet, slightly
draped at the back and not falling at all low upon the
skirt. Her dolman, also short, was composed of black
brooaded velvet, edged with black fur, and two rows of
fur round tha neck. Bonnet, of same material as the
skirt, arranged without fulness over the crown, and
trimmed with a small group of pale pink feathers at the

A LOVE SOSO.
1 NEW STYLE],
Last night, love, when you went away,
(Oh, that's not a poetic line !)
We lingered there, and Luna’s ray
Watched glinting on the flood divine ;
And felt whilst lingering on the strand
(Jaoe more the touch of your white hand.
High up abovo the planets shed
Tneir holy light on earth below.
Each, as it glimmered overhead,
A heavenly radiance seemed to show.
And then wa sobbed—felt ail was gloom,
Aid then we felt—the Old Girl’s broom.
Tha British Medical Journal says that one
of the most curious facts connected with madness is the
utter absence of tears amongst the insane. It this is
the case, speaking big and large, we prefer the insane in
asylums to the doubly insane who put them there. But
wo doubt the statement, high ns the authority is. We
have personal proof to the contrary. When we arrive
home at two or three in the morning, talking triangu-
larly and clutching the air, the "missus" is always
mid, and, after an interval of expostulation with the
poker, always weeps. And h?r tears are io copious that
she, being an economical woman even in ber most
mournful moments, sheds them into a tub, under the
superstitious hallucination that soft water is the best
for washing in. Don’t go to tell us anything about the
insane after this.
A N.Y. paper makes these dreadful remarks on
one of our most conventional habits :— ** In pernicious
imitation of Eiropem society, some pretentious and
toadying people, with more money than brains, have
established the daau ua as a companion of their daughters.
The American girl is independent, bsoan=e she is free ;
virtuous and prudent, because she is trusted. Take
away her freedom, repose no confidence iu her, and she
will soon adopt all the schemes and ruses of the
European girls. Parents should always exeroiee proper
?:us.raia[-Bbip of their daughters, but at the same time
et them know that they plaoe every coottdac.ee ia their
honour. Bad men and bad women are made by pur.
suing an opposite method. The duenna spy system
ie wearing itself out in theold world.4knd the Americans,
therefore, are picking up and wearing worn-out European
garments."
Who marries for love takes a wife; who marries
for fortune takes a mistress ; who marries for position
takes a lady. You are loved by your wife, regarded by
your mis res?, tolerated by your lady. You have a wife
for yourself, a m stress for ycrur house and friends, a
lady for the world and society. Yonr w.fa will agree
with you, yonr mistress will rule yon, jour iady will
manage you Your wife will take care of your house-
ho’d, jour mistress of your home, your lady of your
appearances. If you are sick your wife will nurse you,
yonr mistress will visit you, your lady will inquire after
your health. You take a walk with your wife, a ride
w th your mistress, and go to a party with yonr lady.
Your wife will share your gd#t, yoor mistress your
money, your lady yonr debts. If you are dead, your
wife will weep, your raistrsss will lament, aud your lady
weir mourning. Which will you have ?
Girls, when you read this paragraph, you will
persecute us with your attentions no longer. Wo are
tired of them It you lived on lilies and rose leaves,
perhaps wo should nob have been forced to say this to
you, but as wo have discovered that you eat tripe and
onions, and revel on corned beef and cabbage, we have
lost all romantic ideas about •* sipping the sweets from
your dewy lips." This is what a medical gentleman,
who has “ been there ” before, aud knows what he is
talking about, says with regard to kissing:—“Promis-
cuous kissing has been infinitely more productive of
disease of various kinds than the public ever dream t f,
and it is a practice that should be discountenanced
The people should confine their kissing propensities to
members of their own families, and oven then it is not
always safe." There, now 1 Perhaps, after this, we
shall bo left in peace. And, by the way, the dootor is
quite right in saying that even the kissing of relatives
is not always safe Wo have known very queer conse-
quences ensue from kissing a cousin. Wo ensued.
Titusville is the metropolis of the Pennsylvania
petroleum region. Here the men talk, write, think,and
dream of oil; and even the women and children are
familiar with the lattst fluctuations of the staple article
of trade But. it is only recently that their wives and
daughters have begun openly to “sell fur a fall," or
“ buy for a rise ’* Now the operators come boldly io
the Exchange to watch the prices and instruct thoir
agents. A correspondent has counted ns many as 75
women at one t : m.o eagerly stud)ing the quotations,
scanning note-books resting on the gallery rail, aud
dropping into the hats of the brokers below showers of
little notes containing memoranda for their guidance,
Aming this crowd of female gamblers ware “ fair young
gins in silk and satin, who entered their transactions
with jewelled pencils into the daintest of tablets;
matrons more anxious, but who tried to look uncon-
cerned as they stealthily (passed their orders to the
fiushei middle-men on tha floor; shop-girls eegerly
eyeing the figured; and brokers’ wives whose iscee
showed a superior knowledge of trade, but whose deal-
ings were, as a olaea, the Isast fortunate of all." Iu
one day “the gallery” purchased about 25,000 barrels
of oil, the most lucky c/ tne lady speculators clearing
S7'JO on her transactions. But oil is only one of the
articles out of which the American female gambler en-
deavours to make money easily. She has long dabbled
in mines and real estate; she has before now tried a
corner in pork ; and in Chicago the gentle operators in
grain have a room where they meet, fitted wi«h tele,
graph instruments communicating with the Bourse,
and where at any moment they can intimate their
wishes to the brokers or summon the men of busi-
ness to receive verbal instructions or to proffer verbal
advioe.

A Tasmanian bricklayer employed on a widow’s

house for six mouths to get over his hod paeslou A
young lady of Philuleiphia has inaugurated anew me-
thod of marriage. She constituted herself her lover's
wife by deliberately giving herself to him as such, and
promising fidelity and obedience, in the presence of
witnesses; without exaoti-g any pledge whatever from
him in return, either legal or religi us. She only
wanted himself. It this sort of thing starts

firmly. No man will be safe soon A woman

** Well, doctor, if that is the fearful alternative, you

From a copy of the Sydney War Cbt, just
received, vke see that, as yet, there is not a turn ot the
mangle in Mrs Capring Sutherland, that the Cap. him-
self is a long way otf half-soleing, and that it will evi-
dently be soma time before we see Lieutenant Canty
at a half-finished building, enrolled (this is quite new)
as a uiember of Hod’s Own. It seems that 'ho War
Cry is edited by the male oapting, and, if he does not
exhibit any more ability than the ordinary journalistic
grovellers, he is at least infinitely more amusing
Nothing in tbe world con’d bo drollar than this:—“ I
knew a man and his wife in the old country; they were a
very good match; they both liked their beer, but the
wsmnn came to the Salvatiou Army meetings, and
she got saved, and then went home and threw
her afms round her husband's neck, and said,
‘Jack, I have boon to the Army and got saved,” and
then shegot down on her knees, and prayed for him. It
was a long time bstore ho would give in. Hs used to
come homo drunk, but ha always found his wife on her
knees praying for him, and at last ho couldn’t stand it
any longer." Wo are sorry to learn, though, that
During the meeting the devil made a great distur-
banoe. Ola's bottles were thrown, and several
tried to knock us down, but the Lord pro-
tected ns," which, however we are glad to hoar.
There is something very solemn about that, and
just as we were beginning to think of joining the
Marmy, what should wo come across but this:—
11 Wanted some friend to make the Army a present of a
Bass Drum for their brass band." Wo didn’t see our
way to being quite serious for some time after that I
Thus, says Captain Buthorland, spake unto him a con-
vert" No. 3 Dssr friends, I feel so happy and so full
of the Holy Ghost that I must testify to whatGcd has
done for mo About five years ago I was in a certain
hotel, and there was some singing go : ng on, and this
brother [pointing to the brother that had just spoken I]
came in naif drunk, and said that ha would sing ua a
song, and he sang this: —
I have a Saviour, He’s pleading in glory,
A dear, loving Saviour, though earth friends few,” &a.
And he says this converted him; by whioh we infer
that he was not a gentleman of a very strong mind.
Wo like all this vary much indeed, but what (really
the only thing) we are inclined to deprecate in
the War Cry is a sly rub which the Captain—he being
at Newtown and she at Sydney—gives the missis.
“ Women,” said the eloquent commander, “have
always got plenty to say j the worst of it is, when they
once begin they don’t know where to leave off.” There
is a refined cruelty about this which we regret to
an attribute of one of the Harmy. However, it is a long
lane that has no turning. Likely as not that passage
was a throw-in for the broom-hawker. We consider, on
the whole, that the War, Get is a very nice publication,
and it certainly knocks that of the Gospel contingent as
high as Mr. Dick’s kite. As the country papers say,
■‘We wish it all the success It deserves.”
Just a few additional illustrations of Parkea’
sincerity in tbe role of loyalist right or wrong. When
these colonies wore struggling against the further
introduction of convicts, they wore indeed resenting
a real grievance in the determination of the British
Government to over-ride their wishes and remonstrances
But what was this one grievance compared with
those of which the Irish complain to-day? Personal
liberty is denied, the press is gagged, right ot meeting
is prohibited, Russian methods of Government have
displaced Constitutional ru’e. Juries are packed, and
fair trial to acicnsad persons thus made impossible.
The same Paries who denounces as disloyal every
Irishman who dares to appeal for sympathy to the peo-
ple of New South Wales, and every Englishman who,
preferring the cause of justice to racial prejudices,
recognises that wrong is being done, himself on a much
slighter provocation thus fulminated against Great
Britain, and echoed with rapture the cry “to
arms!’’ raised by another. Speaking at a meet-
ing of the Loigue, in Sydney, on April 6th,
1852, the great loyalist thus delivered himself;—
“ Asa free people, as man, they could not retreat from
their position—they couldno longer go through the farce
ot remonstrating against an injustice which was per-
severed in with an utter disregard of thoir wishes and
their interests— they must do something else Ho was well
pleased to hear their president . Mr. Cowper, talk of fighting
. . . They were about to send Mr. Gowpar as a
delegate to the Conference of tha League at Hobart
Town. When he approached the shores of the island
home of those sturdy and stout-hearted patriots, it was
to be hoped that the bracing influences of their climate
would make bits even bolder than he had bean in his I
speech that evening; and that if the Tasmanian colo-
n;sts should determine to resist tbs lauding of any more
convicts, he would solemnly assure them that the
inhabitants of New South Wales wore ready to assemble
again in some place under Heaven, where a 1 the paople
could be gathered, to ratify all the acts so done, and to
share in all the consequences. The example of the Cape
colonists was before them. The time was come wheu
their only course was to follow that qaam ole, and when-
ever a convict ship should arrive in the Derwent, or in
any other port, to resist at all hazards the landing of the
prisoners thus t.vranioalty forced upon us. He most
sincerely hoped they would not be driven to the catas-
trophe hinted at by their respected member, Mr. Camp-
bell, that of tumbling the prisoners into the sea; but what-
ever bufferings might ensue, at whatever sacrifices, they
were now bound to s r acd to each other in the protection
ot their own liberties. . . . When he was asked bv
hia colleagues in the Council of the League to take part
in the business of that meeting, he consented, because
he considered he had no right to refuse any duty in the
caise: had they asked him to fight, his consent, for the
reasons he had stated, would have been as freely and
a.*' qiyjpUy given ” Aui aga n, ou the 30 hof
Jdao, 1832, Mr. Henry Parkes moved the following
resolution 1 " That this meeting, while solemnly de-
nouncing the continuance of ti ausportatioa to any of
those colonies as incompatible with the permanence of
British rule in Australasia, earnestly protests against
their language being represented as that of wanton
defiance or of anti. British feeling, prompted as it is by
a deep coaaoi; us e s that in their ca-o tha sense of
oppression is in ok a ad in the very proportion in which
tnoso feelings, whioh are a Briton’s noblest heritage
gain streugih amongst the colonists; and that, if tie
fatal alternative should continue to bo thrust upon
them of ohtosing be: ween British connection in name,
and an unsullied British character in fact, the dictates
of principle and the onward course of events mint
bif ore long lead to the preference cf the latter at any
sacrifice.”
