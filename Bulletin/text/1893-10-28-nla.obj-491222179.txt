Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends

137 Elizabeth Street,
SYDNEY.
Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified and registered in London
and the Colonies, as a Physician and Surgeon,
received his Medical Education in the English
and Scottish Universities, and cornnleted his
studies in the leading hospitals of Europe. He
has made a life-long study of
Private, Nervous
AND
SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and coarse, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period
of many years, obtained the highest position in
his profession. The various diseases embraced in
his speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
YOUNTGi 3\flCEI3Sr
AND
THOSE WHO WISH TO MARRY,
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more matured age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely Frequent headaches ;
giddiness ; drowsiness in the day time ; irregu-
larity of the bowels ; feeling of fullness after eat-
ing; specks floating before the eyes ; halos or circles
round a candle; cold hands and feet; pains in the
back, or under the shoulder-blade; tenderness
of the breast-bone on pressure; yellowish dis-
charge from the mouth on to the pillow during
sleep; palpitation of the heart; unpleasant
dreams; clammy hands; an aversion to
society ; a whitish or cloudy sediment in
the urine, after standing; fear of some-
thing dreadful about to happen ; impure blood ;
spots or pimples on the back, chest, legs,
or face ; failing memory ; hacking cough ; falling
of the hair, &c., &c., should consult him, for he is
now enabled, quickly and effectually, to remove
the cause, and so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d, in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,

fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these Colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
that has lost all hope.
ONE FOUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILITY,
and should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above Do Not Delay.
Your case requires advice, and you can either call

reside at a distance, you can sib down quietly in
the privacy of your chamber and write out a full

A Collins-street Gold Mine.
One April day in 1837 a certain Henry Howey,
the owner of a small homestead near Sydney, paid
his weekly visit to that city, his mind bent on
nothing more important than the profitable dis-
posal of his turnips. Chance, however, would
have it otherwise, and caused him to see a
Gazette advertisement of a proposed sale of land
in the newly-mapped-out town of Melbourne, in
the far-away district of Port Phillip. In a
moment of speculative daring he determined to
adventure a few pounds in the purchase of a lot or
two, and, in due course, learnt, through his agent,
that three allotments had been knocked down to
him for an aggregate price of i>94. Whether he
was offered and boldly refused a five-pound note
on his bargain, or whether he paid over his cheque
with a malediction on his folly, is not known, for
he did not live long enough to become famous, or
to leave any memorable remarks upon anything.
He, his wife, and all his family unfortunately
perished together at sea, by the foundering of a
vessel, within two or three years after he had be-
come the owner of a Melbourne city block. When
this sad event became known, John Werge Howey,
his eldest surviving brother, stepped into the
deceased Henry’s shoes as heir-at-law, and took
possession of the farm and effects, including,
amongst .various unconsidered trifles, three pieces
of patch men t, signed by the then high and mighty
Governor, Sir George Gipps, and attested by one
Henry Parkes (no ancestor, by the way, of a
knigntly namesake of a later generation), which
parchments, called Crown Grants, were the dingy
memorials of what the heir-at-law ruefully re-
garded as a very foolish speculation on the part of
the departed Henry ! It cohld not be otherwise.
It was impossible that the dull-witted man should
imagine the mad pranks that abortive Fortune
intended t.o play for his advantage with those
scraps of greasy sheepskin for a basis.
Let us shift the scene. The second half of the
century has begun. Tens of thousands of the
most adventurous spirits of the northern hemis-
phere eagerly hasten to Port Phillip Bay and the
new Eldorado which had been discovered there.
They all land in Melbourne. In Melbourne
they purchase the outfit and sustenance which
they require at the mines.; to Melbourne they
send the result of their labours for transmis
sion to the world without. Melbourne holds tic-
key to the richest gold-producing land the world
has so far seen, and, therefore, the owners of M- I
bourne land can levy a toll on all that pass.
through it—a toll commensurate with these*ad-
vantages.
John Werge Howey, contentedly growing hi-
turnips on the farm near Sydney, hears of the
gold discovery, but fails to see what it means for
him, fails to see that those despised parchments
give him the power to claim a lot of II is gold for
his own. Not for long, however. For one day
arrives a letter from a limb o’-tb’-law in Mel-
bourne, asking Mr. Howey, on behalf of a client,
what are the terms on which he will permit a
building to be erected on bis land ; and-, io and
behold, before slow-witted John Werge has had
time to understand the import of this request,
there came more letters from more solicitors,
writing on behalf of other clients, all anxious to
ascertain the terms on which he will permit them
to become his vassals.
For that which John Werge Howey had dropped
into for nothing, and thedepaited Henry obtained
for .£94, was an allotment at the ci rner of Collins
and Hwanston streets (afterwards known as Ger-
man Nicholson’s corner), with a frontage to the
former street of 132 feet, and a depth along Swans-
ton-street, half-way to Little Collins-street, to-
gether with two adjoining allotments in Collins-
street, comprising another 132 feet frontage, and
running the whole way back to Little Collins-
street. Here was an acre and a-half of land in the
very heart of the then rapidly-rising city, almost
every square foot of which was competed for by
enterprising traders, and would soon he covered
with buildings.
John Werge Howey was equal to the occasion.
He went to another lawyer, and the fiat went
forth to each of the eager applicants that the con-
ditions were : first, the erection of a building of a
certain value at the applicant’s expense, such
building to be kept in good repair equally at the
expense of the applicant, and to become the pro-
perty of his liege-lord—the said John Werge
Howey—after the lapse of 21 years ; and second,
that the highest bidder, the man who undertook
to pay the greatest amount each year, would be
granted permission to erect the building under
these terms.
Greatly must John Werge have marvelled when
he found that exceedingly handsome yearly pay-
ments were tendered in exchange for the privileges
which he so generously offered. But, nevertheless,
it was so. While a veritable stream of gold came
flowing into his coffers, his land became covered
with buildings, which cost him nothing, and
which became his property as soon as the leases
fell in. And as they fell in, he found that he
could let the shops at rents which doubled, and
trebled, and quadrupled as the years went by.
Without any previous toiling or sowing, without
work of any kind, the land in this tpiraculous
manner yielded him a weekly recurring harvest of
gold. And the more this maeic ground was
reaped the richer and richer were the returns,
while the very cost of reaping it was cast upon
somebody else than the favoured owner. For
when the tenants came from time to time and
made humble obeisance to this now great lord or
his satrap, and besought new leases, they were
fain to retake their shops upon terms which left
the lord free of all imaginable charges.
And so, in a short time, John Werge Howey,
with piles of gold, betook him to England, and
became a great territorial magnate, and all the
tribe of Howeys prospered exceedingly. One of
them, a younger John, was made a major in the
army, and was set Up in an establishment for him-
self, which was, indeed, once a castle of a family
of the old nobility of England, Forty thousand
pounds a year, paid punctually in England, out of
the produce of these wonderful three allotments,
might well sustain the pride and state of even
nobler people than the fortunate Howeys. In
1871. John the elder died, 30 years after poor
Henry’s sad death, and the major has ever since
enjoyed the magnificent income of the estate.
During all these years an enlightened Government
and City Corporation have lovingly watched over,
protected, and increased the value of the property
without, substantially, a cent’s cost to the lucky
Howeys, whose fortune would not be as safe if it
were in golden sovereigns lodged in the vaults of
the Bank of England. Does anyone wonder how
so large an income could be produced from so
small a property ? Let us see on what sort of con-
ditions the major graciously permits a worthy
citizen to occupy a little bit of it, say 30-odd feet,
with a shallow depth, for a term of 21 years. The
tenant pays (and the terms now mentioned were
fixed long antecedent to the land-boom) about
<£l2 0 per annum for the bare ground, and is
obliged to build his own shop premises at an out-
lay of six or seven thousand pounds and walk out,
leaving everything behind Inm, when the term
expires. No wonder that the valuation made in
1888 gave £889,500 as the value of the fee simple
of the property.
The questions which we ask, however, and
which, no doubt, Major Howey also,asks himself
in the privacy of his Scottish castle, are, first—
What manner of fools is the community composed
of, which permits him to levy a tax of about
£40,000 a year on its labour, without his rendering
any service in. return; which gives the same
privilege to others of his kind to an extent which,
vaguely stated, amounts to about £5,000,000 a
year; and which then wonders that the mass of
its people are condemned to hopeless toil and
poverty? And, secondly When will the com-
munity regain its sanity and put a stop to this
unjust, pernicious, and immoral system ?

Euchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
tli" loss of tone in the parts concerned in its e\ actuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buohu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Med cal men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. :—The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, p omoting the secretions of Bile, and collecting it
when d ■ranged, ai d restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveners.
D. ECKhTUOM, M.D.— BBBB—I find those Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D. —lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exuti a prculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
ROW’S STEANE’P WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION.—When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

must’rin’ here - •
Killed in the flamin’ mallee, yardin’ a scrub 1 r,. I
steer !
They say as he’s gone to Heaven, an’ shook off his
worldly cares,
But I can’t sight Bill in a halo sot up on three
blinded hairs.
In Heaven! what next, I wonder, for, strike me
pink an’ blue,
[f I savey what in thunder they’ll find for Bill
to do.
He’d never make one o’ them angels with faces as
white as chalk,
All wool to the toes, like hoggets, an’ wings like
a eagle ’awk :
He couldn’t ’arp for apples, his voice ’ad tones as
jarred,
An’ he’d no more ear than a bald-faced bull, or
calves in a brandin’-yard.
He could sit on a buckin’ brumbie like a nob in an
easy-cheer,
An’ chop Ins name with a green-hide fall on the
flank of a flyin’ steer,
He could show the saints in glory the way that a
fall should drop,
But, sit on a throne ?—not William—unless they
could make it “ prop.”
If the Heav’nly hosts got “ boxed ” now, as mobs
most always will,
Why, who’d out ’em out like William, or draft on
the camp like Bill ?
An ’orseman ’ud find it awkward, at first, with a
push that flew,
But, blame my cats, if I knows what else they’ll
find for Bill to do.
He mightn’t freeze to the seraphs, or chum with
the cherubim,
But if ever them seraph-johnnies get “ pokin’ it,”
like, at him,
Well, if there’s hide in Heaven, an’ silk for to
make a lash,
He’ll yard the lot in the Jasper Lake in a blinded
lightnin’-flash !
It’s hard if there ain’t no cattle, but p’raps they’ll
let him sleep,
An’ wake him up at the Judgment for to draft
them goats an’ sheep.
It’s playin’ it low on William, but p’rhaps he’ll
buckle-to,
Just to show them high-toned seraphs what a
mallee-man kin do.
If they saddles a big-boned angel—with a turn o
speed, of course—
As can spiel, like a four-year brumbie, an prop
like an old camp-horse,
If they puts Bill up with a snaffle, an’ a four or
five-inch spur,
An’ eighteen foot o’ green-hide for to chop the
blinded fur.
He’ll draft them blamed angoras in a way, it’s
safe to swear,
As’ll make them toney seraphs sit back on their
thrones an’ stare.

One of the few kind things said about
Westralia is credited to a Hamilton (Vic.) man :
“1 must give the country (between Perth and
York) credit for growing wild dowers in pro-
fusion. These are simply magnificent, all sorts
and colours, but, strange to say, we have not
come across any boronia since leaving Albany.”
In Maoriland the backs of stamps are now
let out for advertising purposes. This leads to
curious results, now and then. At Milton,
recently, a witness put in as evidence a receipt
dated July, ’92. The magistrate held it up to the
light and read on the stamp the words, “Use
Blank’s coal, the cheapest and best.” Then he
sent for Blank, and found that his coal “ad.’’
didn’t appear till February, ’93. At this stage
the witness climbed down and left in a great
hurry.
James Duncan, a Launceston (Tas.)
septuagenarian, earned by natural decease quite
a suicide’s recognised portion of local newspaper
fame. The majestically sonorous Launceston
Daily Telegraph, in a reverent half-column,
mentioned that he had been
Employed as javelin-man at the gael, letter-carrier in
the Post Office department, and for a time he had charge
of one of the hydrants for dispensing water, prior to the
inauguration of the present system of reticulation.
The immortality of a turncock ! What a dreadful
thing it must be to run a newspaper in Laun-
ceston !
The Anglican Bishop and R.C. Archbishop
of Melbourne are drearily wrangling in their
respective pulpits about the Origin of the Church
of England. Neither of them lias a new thought
to throw into the discussion, and each of their
congregations would scorn to listen to what the
other man has to say. Both prelates grind forth
a mixture of truths, myths and wilful lies that
■constitute either of the rival traditions, whilst
any objections that they raise to one another’s
arguments are founded on facts sworn to ages ago
by people who didn’t know anything. The one
ray of humour in the whole cackle comes from tfie
unanimous assumption by the pair of bishops that
God specially inspired the aforesaid Origin,
anyway. Were it not for this extenuating joke
; the wrangle ought to be put down.
Colemane & Sons’ Special Eucal. Oil is A one.
Professor Garner, writing from Darkest
Africa with his tame chimpanzee in his lap,
almost apologises for suffering from an occasional
surfeit of that animal. “After a good sleep he
ulimbs on my lap and embraces me with devotion
until I really tire of him,’’ says the Professor.
One can picture the blush rising to his cheek as he
ad,nits that the monkey comes it a-,bit:too strong.
A ud yet it is probable that the same Professor, in
nis early married life, thought nothing of feeling
bored when his wife tried to keep up the foolish
custom of sitting on Iris knee. And naturally
enough. No woman can compare with a missing
link as an object of interest. Also she becomes
very heavy on the lap after a very little time, her
weight increasing more ranidly than otherwise if

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1893.
The Colo Valley Grab.
The N.S. Wales Legislature has practically
ratified that stupendous fraud upon posterity,
the “Australasian Rights Purchase Bill”
so called, apparently, because it is not Aus-
tralasian, because there is no purchase in it
but a mere bald, unmitigated grab of the
public assets, and because it refers, not to
“rights,” but to public wrongs, whereby the
whole title is a lie save the word “ bill” at
the conclusion. The purpose of this
notorious measure is to give away—not to
sell or to lease, but to give without any
visible reason which can be mentioned
in decent democratic society—to a party
of private speculators what amounts to
the sole privilege of supplying electric-
light and power to Sydney and all the towns
adjacent—practically to the whole county of
Cumberland, and more than half the popu-
lation of the province. No one even pro-
fesses to assert that ths speculators who
receive this valuable gift have ever rendered
any spednl services to the nation at large
that the£ should be thus favoured. They
have never, so far as anybody is aware, done
anything: of importance for the good oi any-
body sive thfemselvos. The monopoly winch
has beeVl conferred upon them without
money ifitvd without pr.ce will sell for
perhaps a quarter to haif-a million pounds
on the London m irket— that is to say, a com-
pany can be formed in London on short
notice, which will buy the concession
alone' for, say, the smaller of those
two amounts. If the Government of
New Bouth Wales was resolved to let this
great national work drift into private hands
—which it should not have done on any
terms; whatsoever—it could itself have sold
the concession in London on these same
terms, and then the empty Treasury at
Sydney would hive benefited to the extent
of £250,000. Therefore, the transaction
amounts to a gift of, say, £250,000 ol public
money, bestowed upon certain individuals
who, so lar as is known, have done nothing
which Ciflf'lJerir public inspection to deserve
this lavish evidence of gratitude. 'The syndi-
cators them selves ma.e n> scvie of the
Value of their ajqu.siUoa.
The speculators who estimated the selling-
price of their concession at £250,000 are
probably below, rather than above, the
mark. Electricity is admittedly the light
of the future. The feeble glimmer
of gas will, ere long, become al-
most as obsolete as the pine torch or
the pre-historic “ dip.” It is dull and yel-
low, costly, unwholesome and destructive in
many ways, also its production requires a
vast amount of elaborate machinery, un-
sightly gasometers, evil odours, and other
objectionable circumstances. When gas be-
comes extinct there is no possible doubt
about its successor. There is not even the
beginning of a suggestion of any other illu-
minant which can supersede electricity in
the future ; so far as human judgment goes
the electric lighting monopoly should be
good for centuries. And not only is electri-
city the light, but it is also the motive-
power of the future—the power which will,
eventually, take the place of steam, water,
horse-flesh, everything. It will be used for
every purpose where strength is essential —
for engines, lifts, cranes, tram-cars and other
vehicles ; it will be the muscle and bone of
the coming ages, the life and light of all
tilings, the beginning and end of civilisa-
tion. Unless perpetual motion becomes
a realised fact, electricity seems to be
without any possible rival. When it has
been once fairly introduced, then the
“ring” which commands the electric sup-
ply of any city practically owns that city and
everything and everybody therein. If the
community, at any future time, objects to
its law-embastioned monopoly, it has only to
turn a handle or lay its huger on a key, and
half-a-million people are left in darkness,
every street and every house is given over to
gloom and desolation from sunset to sunrise,
every factory stops, every tramcar ceases to
run, the cranes on the wharves are motion-
less, and paralysis descends on everything.
Even the papal interdict, in the days when
the papacy was in its zenith, would hardly
produce more astonishing results. It will be
the end of the world in miniature—the
Twilight of the Gods—and the electric
monopoly wdll be the Almighty, and the
shindykit’s office the judgment-seat.
* # #
The great cost involved in the production
of electricity is the one difficulty which has
hitherto retarded its progress. It is for this
cause and no other that it has not altogether
superseded gas nor made steam an extinct
superstition. Electricity, when it has to be
generated by the use of coal, is too expen-
sive, so far as modern appliances go ; it is
only when it can be furnished by water-
power that it becomes enormously cheaper—
as well as more efficient—than all its rivals.
Sydney, in this respect, is more favoured
than most of the world’s great cities. It has
two—and only two—rivers, the Colo and
the Grose, which are swift and strong enough
to furnish electricity in illimitable quantities,
and near enough to do it at infinitesimal
rates, not only to Sydney, but to every town
in the County of Cumberland. The other
streams of the metropolitan district are all
too sluggish, too feeble, or too uncertain to
answer the purpose. Therefore, when
this magnificent water-power has been
fooled away to a private syndicate,
that syndicate will be blessed with one of the
most far-reaching monopolies on record. It
will be guaranteed against all possible com-
petition--unless some method be discovered
of using the tides as a motive power—by the
fact that it possesses the only force which is
available between now and the end of the
world, and Nature itself will be its patent
and its copyright. It will own the New
South Wales capital, and its surroundings,
and its inhabitants, and its industries, and
may yet be quoted on the Stock Exchange as
“ The Almighty, Limited.”
• • «
The most noteworthy feature in the debate
upon the syndicate’s Bill was the stern
resolve of the Legislature to make the sur-
render as complete as possible. Even the
proposal of ex-Justice Mankind, in the
Legislative Council, that a royalty of 5 per
cent, of the company’s receipts should be
charged for the use of this stupendous
“natural opportunity,” was decisively
rejected. The House even professed to
regard the syndicate as being rather hardly
treated than otherwise. Yet shares in the
Colo Valley enterprise are now saleable at
£*2oo each, and are steadily rising ; and as
no work has yet been done, and practically
no money spent, this is simply the esti-
mated value of a share in the privilege of
levying blackmail upon the New South
Wales capital. The citizens have been sold
—or rather given away—to the syndicate to
be squeezed, even as the Moorish sultans,
when they were too tired to attend to the
work in person, used to sell a rich subject
fora certain sum, whereupon the buyer com-
pressed his purchase in a wooden frame until
the flattened victim gave up his wealth.
# * #
The one ostensibly redeeming feature in
the whole glaring job is the provision
whereby the State may terminate the mono-
poly after it has lasted for 15 years, by purchas-
ing after that time, with the nation’s money,
a tiohe of what it now gives away for nothing.
But experience hasshown that even thisfeeblo
consolation is rather illusory than real.
Nearly every monopoly in every civilised
land is adorned with the same provision,
and, with hardly an exception, it proves to
be a thing of no account. In New South
Wales the Crown “ owns ” the g »ld beneath
private lands, but who can get a - , that gold 1
n Britain the Legislature reserved the
right of purchasing the railways, but instead
the railways have purchased the Legisla-
ture. In the United States one wealthy
corporation—the unspeakable Union Pacific
Railway Co.—owes the State many millions
of dollars, and in addition to refusing pay-
ment of the principal it promoted a bill to
postpone the interest for a whole century.
And these are by no means isolated cases.
When a great monopoly nominally expires it
is almost invariably found that it has grown
too strong to be dealt with. Long before
the Colo syndicate’s patent runs out all its
present shareholders may be dead, but it will
have its own gang of members in Parlia-
ment —probably by that time it will own
25 per cent, of the Legislature and
they will be allied with the future railway
and tramway syndicate’s members, and the
members for the Associated Banks—for with
their increased capital, the New South Wales
banks will begin about then to own the whole
earth, and the members for the land-mono-
poly, and the like ; and each will vote by
mutual agreement for all the other monopo-
lies, and the great Colo and Grose River
job will be renewed for another century—
or ten centuries, or for eternity.
* » •
And even if it stood alone it would pro-
bably be rich enough by that time to buy a
parliamentary majority with hard cash.
Until the Referendum is established, so that
the whole nation can personally veto sucli
things as the Queensland Land Grant Rail-
way project, and the New South Wales rail-
way-and-tramway-steals scheme, and the
electric-light and power monopoly, every
job that is big enough to mysteriously
influence the whole Legislature will be passed
with enthusiasm. It is impossible to “in-
fluence ” the majority of the nation, there-
fore the Referendum is an efficient s;ife-
guard for the public interests, and is
proof against everything except public igno-
rance, stupidity and apathy. But nothing
else is of any account. In almost every
gathering of a hundred men—whether it
be a Legislature, or a church conference, or
a society of pawnbrokers—there are sixty
who can be influenced in one way or another.
And when a whole metropolis is to be
fleeced there is always enough argument
to buy the requisite sixty—or more. Con-
cerning the New South Wales legislators
who whooped for the bald and undisguised
Colo Valley grab, some did so, probably,
because they were more or less indirectly
interested in the great speculation ; a few
lent their aid in consideration of support
rendered, or to be rendered, to their own
little games ; a few gave their assistance out
of sheer obtuseness of intellect; and, as for
the balance, the only feasible explanation
seems to be that they acted as they did
through original sin and a cold-blooded
sympathy with what is euphemistically
termed “private enterprise.” Failing these
things the only possible explanation is
catalepsy—or possibly somnambulism.
Jack Ketch—His Social Status.
The other day, in a suburban police-court, a
Melbourne solicitor sneered at the office of the
Public Executioner, who happened to be
plaintiff in an assault case arising, apparently,
out of the alleged fact that he had been
thrashing his wife. A common solicitor held
up to scorn the Common Hangman, and actually
told him that he was “no man,” or he would
not consent to hold his degrading position.
The stupelied Bench took no notice whatever
of this desecrating attack upon the high office
of State Assassin ; the common solicitor was
not reprimanded, and the Supreme Court has
allowed the matter to pass unnoticed. The
Bulletin is not now concerned about the
official rights and personal feelings of the
Government Neck-breaker, but it is moved to
its core concerning the insult offered to that
venerable temple of the Law—the Supreme
Court of Victoria. Part of that sacred pal-
ladium of public liberty is the Public
Executioner, and any insult levelled at that
functionary in his official capacity is an insult
to the Court, an offence of “contempt” so
flagrant that no self-respecting judicial dig-
nitary can afford to pass it over without
reproof. For a solicitor, himself under solemn
guild obligations to the Supreme Court, to
flout publicly an officer of the law, and say to
him abusively and vulgarly, “You are no man,
or you would not hold your present office,”
dynamites, in one ruffianly outrage, the whole
structure of justice, profanes the sanctuary of
the law, and commits the crime of Contempt of
Court in its capital degree.
# * «
Let us think of all that it involves. The
public Flagellator and Finisher is the key-
stone of the arch of the Supreme Court.
He is as important and necessary and awe-
some in his conventional official capacities as
is the Chief Justice himself. He is, so to
speak, the arm of Justice, the Judge being
the head. Is it not as great a blasphemy
to take in vain the arm of Jehovah as the
head of Jehovah? Is it not as great and as
criminal an act of Contempt of Court to
execrate the arm of Justice as the head of
Justice? Let us, therefore, imagine a correla-
tive offence. Let us suppose that Chief Justice
Madden has just presided with great patience
and dignity at a trial, and has just delivered
one of those sentences which have assisted to
make him famous, and ordered some miserable
or some notorious law-breaker to be given 25
lashes, or to be hanged by the neck until he is
dead. Up rises an impetuously disrespectful
barrister and says :
Your Honor is no man, hut a brute, or your
Honor would never prescribe such barbarity as your
Honor dors in ordering the ho ly of a fellow-human to be
thus mutilated.
The majestic fury of the court can be imagined.
An outraged earth make would swallow up the
offender. Horror would overwhelm “every
right-thinking person,” because Justice had not
only been deflowered but branded with in-
famy.
• * •
Yet, inasmuch as this desecration has been
done to the Common Hangman, it has been
done to every Supreme Court Judge. If the
cynical layman, or the bullyragging lawyer, is
permitted contemptuously to spit at John
Ketch, Esq., or the cat-o’-nine-tuils, what
becomes of the Supreme Court, or of the inferior
flogging tribunals? Where is the line of per-
missive contempt to be drawn? May one jibe
at the “ dull thud ” while he must enforcedly
respect the “ black cap ? ” Is it permissible to
gloat over the “greased rope,” but highly
criminal to speak lightly of the Judge’s “ Lokd-
have-mercy-on-your-soul ? ” Is a man allowed
to fling a dead cat at the Official Man-butcher,
while he may speak only with reverentially
bated breath to and of the Official Man-cOn
demer? The logic of the matter is that, as long
as Capital Punishment and the barbarous sys-
tem of flogging are legal penalties, the Judge,
the Sheriff, and the Hangman must stand or
fall together in the esteem that properly attaches
to any institution which is allowed to embrace
such remarkably dissimilar components.
* # •
Whichopensup the picturesque questionof the
social status of the important penal official whom
a common solicitor has been permitted with im-
punity to affront. If our criminal code is decent,
praiseworthy, and deserving of our respectful
veneration, all of its administrators, considered
purely in their official capacity, must be also
worthy of public esteem. How comes it,
therefore, that the Public Executioner, in bis
official capacity, cannot, like the fat, well
groomed Judge, proudly trip along “ the
Block,” with moustaches carefully waxed an I
a choice nosegay on his breast, or attend asp r-
ing social functions and make neat speeches
about the excellent philanthropic work done by
the Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Society? Aud-
it the State Worker-off may be ruthlessly
branded with infamy in open Court, why is the
Judge protected? The Judge orders the
bloody spectacle ; his subordinate merely carries
out the older, as a flunkey may bear the game
that his master has bagged. The Judge is, so
to speak, the blood-provider. Moreover, as
many witnesses of gaol-flagellations can testily,
the flogger has, and uses, a discretion which
does not appertain to the Judge. What many
people want to know is—where is the Mel-
bourne lawyer cranky enough to rise up in
Chief Justice Madden’s own Court, and inform
that potentate, say, just after he has ordered
two punishments of 25 lashes each, within a
period of one month, that his sentence is brutal
and unmanly, and, as a feeling reminder of his
Honor’s past interest in the prize-ring, hardly
in consonance with the best traditions of* true-
sport ?
* * *
There is no greater hypocrisy extant in this
world of humbug than that generally acquiesced
in by common consent —the pretence of feeling
an old-fashioned respect for the Hanging Judge
and an old-fashioned loathing for the Comm >n
Hangman. If the Omega of a detestable trad,
tion is a thing to be spurned by every decent
man, how much more the Alpha ? And even
the nominators of the Omega usually rake the
refuse of humanity for their nominee. Often,
before a candidate is appointed Public Execu
tioner, the police are required to advise that he
has a satisfactory police record. It has never
occurred to anyone to insist that he should be
able to make affecting speeches on social-reform
questions, like his brother-officials in the Blood
Department. The, night before Colston, the
Narbethong crank, victim of incipient progres-
sive paralysis, was hanged in Dr.
Shields, the gaol medical officer, presided at a
meeting that was shedding sentiment about Dr.
Barnakdo’s Home for Outcast Boys. Sheriff
Anderson was dropping pearls of Presbyterian
wisdom around also about that time ; Judge
Molesworth was infusing moral energy into
the Anglican Synod; but Jones, the Common
Hangman, where was he ? History is actually
as dumb as though Jones was not. He only
blazed into the papers next day. Why this
favouritism ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
G. H. Reid’s Sympathy.
Tee old-time spectre of the unemployed was
held up the other night—for the several-thou-
sandth time in New South Wales Assembly
by G. H. Reid, who was of opinion, in
a vague and foggy fashion, that the Govern-
ment ought to interfere. After the hazy
manner peculiar to the politician, especially
when a general election is at hand, he
believed that somebody else ought to do
something at some other person’s expense to
relieve the general distress. Mr. Reid, by the
way, has never been known to do anything to
relieve the general distress, and he had not
even a plan to suggest, except that the Govern-
ment should borrow more money and start
more public works to improve Fat Man’s
property, after the grand old Parkesian fashion,
and incidentally supply a certain amount of
employment while doing so. The cessation of
public works and “departmental economies”
were, he said, to a considerable extent respon-
sible for the country’s troubles. A very little
while ago, Mr. Reid cursed the Government
with the most whole-souled curse in his limited
vocabulary because it didn’t economise and
stop the accumulating deficiency ; and that
it has done so he curses because the economies
he demanded have come to pass and produced
exactly the result which everybody ip Ids
senses knew that they would produce. 1 The
country is somewhat weary qf this kiiid of
sympathy. It is impossible to relieve the dis-
tress by building more railways ; even it New
South Wales spent £4,(XXJ,(XX) per annum on
public works it would make very little differ-
ence. If G. H. Reid gets into power things
will be just as bad as they are with G, R. Du’.im
in power—possibly a little w'orse. The old,
pottering school of politicians may come and
go, and move that they have no confidence in


each other, and shuffle in and out of office, and
the unemployed will be none the better. The
blessed “ influx of foreign capital ” never makes
any difference. Neither does the “ restoration
of confidence.” The “opening up of the
country,” which every ancient political
jobber advances as the cure for every
public ill, leaves things worse rather
than better. The “settlement of the
people on the land,” is a sham and a hopeless
failure, because the people are always settled
■on some remote and sterile waste which the Fat
Man doesn’t want for speculative purposes;
unless the State is prepared to lay violent hands
on the vast areas which Fat Man is holding
for a rise within a 60-mile radius of Sydney,
and settle the people there, the thing might as
well be left alone. There is nothing to be
gained by sending the poor all over the country
with a heavy heart and a big shovel apiece, and
telling them to look for gold where no gold is
obtainable. A vigorous public works policy is
drivel and a hollow mockery. “ Thrift ”is a
bogus pretence, and days of humiliation and
prayer are an insult, and G. H. Reid is only
another version of the dog that came and licked
the sores of Lazarus, and then, so far as the
record goes, went away again and left him as
be was before. But in the present case, the dog
demands that Lazarus shall vote for him, be-
cause he came and looked at Lazarus in his
affliction, and this intolerable assumption on
bis part is an aggravation of the mendicant’s
affliction, and gratuitous insult added to injury.
Jumping on the Dead.
Matthew Davies, who is “meeting the charges
against him ” witli his thumb to his nose, was
last week permitted by an obsequious bench of
[magistrates to slander their dead brother within
the precincts of the court. Matthew seemingly
Wins carte blanche to make any “statement” he
'Chooses and be as cast-irouly impudent as suits
Ihis precious purpose, but for a while he
restricted himself to insulting only the comrnon
intelligence of the flabby Melbourne public.
On the occasion in question this insufferable
attorney went a good deal further than usual.
He said of the late M‘l)onald, J.P.—“ I hold
in my possession statutory declarations show-
ing that that justice had determined to commit
me before one word of the evidence was heard.”
The old colleagues of M ‘Donald permitted
Davies to fire off his charge without daring
to comment upon it, and the local
press also passed it through their columns in
silence. This is interesting as evidence of
Matthew’s unique position in police court
history. Now, let us examine the asser-
tion of this privileged individual and see
what it amounts to. Whose statutory declara-
tions does he hold, why were they not
produced before M’Donald died, and how
can they possess any value even if they be
sworn to by men of unblemished character ?
The presumption is that Davies would have
put names to them were the names worth any-
thing to the story. That they couldn’t be worth
much is an absolute certainty, inasmuch as no
man can swear to the making-up of another
man’s mind. However, seeing tnat Mat-
thew Davies refers to these mysterious
statutory declarations with pride, he may
as well calm his arrogance with the re-
flection that 21 out of 23 grand jurymen came
.'to the same determination as M‘ Donald, a
circumstance justifying the suspicion that a
larger percentage of tlie magistrates who did
not commit him arrived at court with the in-
tention of letiing him off. Also, Matthew
Davies can be supplied, if he will, with stacks
of dec I arations to the effect that the Mercan-
tile liank case has been a disgusting scandal
from the first, and that McDonald, J.P., was
the one man who has, thus far, earned
honourable distinction in connection with it.

Melbourne’s Postal Service.
It is whispered in Melbourne that there will
shortly be a “burst-up” in the G.P.0., and a
ghastly exposure of disorganisation in the Vic-
torian postal service. The sooner this happens,
the better for Australasia at large, not to men-
tion far-away countries, whose lost and strayed
correspondence is necessarily slow to make its
disappearance understood at either end of the
world. The letter-stealing, or mere wanton
destruction of letters that has been proved to
happen in the Melbourne districts, is not a
matter only for Melbourne consideration, al-
though the indifference of that exhausted city
to every kind of scandal is solely responsible
for the present alarming epidemic of postal
“accidents.” Instances of letters posted in
one suburb never reaching their destination in
another suburb have lately increased and multi-
plied without exciting more than a passing
comment. Melbourne is so used to things
being wrong, instead of right, that it would
remain passive until the delivery of letters
ceased entirely. Then the poor, jaded place
might utter a feeble wail for an enquiry, but,
meanwhile, the percentage of letters that don’t
get lost is quite good enough for Melbourne.
The fact that nothing has been heard in the
’Ouse, or local press, on this important subject
goes no way to lessen its importance. Probably
members, when spoken to, and editors, when
written to, shake their heads and think that
silence is essential to the restoration of public
confidence, and are waiting for the aforesaid
“ burst-up ” to cure the disease. It is impos-
sible for an outsider to say where his non-
delivered letters get to. Enough for him to
know that they are “lost in the post,” and that
the P.M.G. invariably regrets his inability to
throw any light on the subject.
Sane or Mad?
Glasson, the Carcoar (N.S.W.) assassin, was
found guilty on Saturday last and sentenced to
be hanged. Concerning his guilt there never
appeared to be any serious doubt, and the whole
case hinged on the question of the murderer’s
sanity—that question which turns up at almost
every murder, and is hardly ever settled,
because the discussion (as in the case of Col-
ston, who, so far as the great consensus of medi-
cal evidence went, was undoubtedly an inci-
pient general paralytic) is interrupted by
the hangman. Glasson, undoubtedly, was
not mad in any ordinary acceptation of the
term. He was not afflicted with the stage
variety of derangement—the insanity which
causes the patient to gibber on the highways
and otherwise make a spectacle of himself
before the public ; and this is practically the
only kind that is recognised by law. His
intellect, apparently, never amounted to very
much—it was only the ordinary intelligence of
a very ordinary young man ; the intellect of a
person who expected to break into a bank-safe
with no weapon but a tomahawk never could
have amounted to very much. But whether
what there was of it was off its balance or not
there is no very definite evidence to show. The
defence amounted, in effect, to a plea of irre-
sistible criminal impulse, but then irresistible
impulse is a mere assertion, and seems likely to
remain so indefinitely. No one, save, perhaps,
the criminal himself, knows whether the im-
pulse was really irresistible or not, and no one
even knows if the criminal himself is clear upon
the point. As a deeply-interested party, his
assertion cannot be accepted as sufficient evi-
dence, and there is nothing else to go upon.
When an individual, whose act cannot be other-
wise explained, nearly saws his head off with a
carving-knife, it is generally assumed (self-pre-
servation being the “first law of nature ”) that
he was driven to it by an impulse which he
couldn’t resist, but even this is mere assump-
tion, seeing that no one knows whether he
attempted to resist it or not. For all the
evidence shows, Glasson’s crime might have
arisen out of permanent insanity, hypnotic sug-
gestion, homicidal impulse, original sin or
carefully-acquired wickedness—there is not
much proof either way. The one certainty
of the case is that his execution will
not help in any way to decide the question.
The chance that he is a responsible being and
the chance that he is not are about equal.
The unspeakable foolishness of his crime—his
theatrical, penny-dreadful idea of attacking a
bank with an axe—the utter, childish futility
of his schemes both before and after the
murder, all seem to suggest that he was either
a person of unhinged brain or of very little
brain of any kind. But the alternatives are
equally feasible, and, in New South Wales,
when doctors disagree, the world knows who
generally decides.

That remarkable man, George Pile, of
Sydney, whose desire to write to the news-
papers will only end in the grave, has broken
out in a new place. He is now conducting a
voluminous correspondence to prove that Russia
is a country where the land-tax policy pre-
dominates; in his own words: “Nearly the
whole of the taxation of the empire is derived
directly from the land.” After which Mr.
Pile distinctly infers, though he does not
openly assert, that the horrible condition of
Russia, with its immense military burdens, its
despotism, corruption, ignorance, famine, the
atrocious brutality of its Government, its
Siberian penal system, its drunkenness, religious
intolerance, aggressiveness, and all its other
ills, are the result of its alleged land-tax policy,
and that when Australia begins to levy upon
the fatted monopolist it will arrive at the same
awful destination. Under these circumstances
it will probably interest Mr. Pile and his
admirers to know that Russia does not
raise most of its taxation from the land, so
that the dreadful auctioneer falls right
through the bottom of his own argument.
Out of a revenue of about £90,000,000
the empire raises £45,000,000 in Customs and
excise, over £8,000,000 by poll-tax, £3,000,000
from the post-office, £3,000,000 from crown
lands, and £30,000,000 from “sundries.”
Also, to cut the matter short, there is no land-
tax in Russia, and the land revenue consists
merely of instalments received from the
peasantry for land sold to them on deferred
payment by the State, the said land having
been bought on a compulsory system from the
great freeholders after the emancipation.
These discrepancies, probably, don’t matter
much, for nobody save himself takes much
interest in Geo, Pile in his literary capacity.
and The Bulletin merely offers this explana-
tion out of a personal interest in the most con-
sistently obtuse auctioneer of its acquaintance.
The Brisbane Ministers’ Union announces that
cheap dancing-halls the places where the
haggard, weedy city youth takes his best girl
in the evenings on a joint admission fee of
2s. 6d.—are responsible for much of the immo-
rality of the Queensland metropolis, and con-
siders that they should be suppressed by legal
process. The cheap dancing-hall isn’t a lovely
place of amusement, but when it is suppressed
the last gleam of joy will go out of the life of
many a tawdry little seamstress, and dress-
maker’s apprentice, and weary shop-girl, and
tired little woman who stipples photographs, and
female clerk, and other poor little shabby-
genteel maidens who follow all manner of back-
breaking avocations at starvation wages. VV hen
it is gone everything —to a great many of these
white slaves—will be a dead level of that
same drab-coloured monotony which the parson
loves, and then, perhaps, the work-girl will go
to church more regularly, and hear the preacher
talking in a dull monotone about Hell. In The
Bulletin’s opinion, however, the dancing-
saloon has done quite as much as the Church to
arrest immorality. It is a vulgar, sordid little
dissipation, but at least it is a break in the
monotony of the w T ork-rooms and the airless
slums ; and more immorality arises out of the
utter dreariness of a life without recreation
than out of any kind of dissipation yet in-
vented. Moreover, the church choir, regarded
as an incentive to immorality, can hold its own
fairly well with the dancing-saloon, and the
1.0.G.T. lodge makes a very good second. It
would be interesting to learn the data on which
the Ministers’ Union arrived at its conclusions.
If it didn’t get there by personal observation —
in other words, if the principal parson didn’t
go to the saloon in person, and pay his 2s. 6d.
honestly at the door, and dance vigorously all
the evening—then the alleged facts are only
conjecture and of no value as legal evidence.
A Richmond (Melb.) servant-girl swore an in-
formation alleging criminal assault against a
common, no-account workman. Later on, she
changed her mind, and refused to give evidence.
The Richmond Bench committed her to prison
for a week. In view of recent similar cases, in
which the accused males own that magic
possession “social influence,” this magisterial
action is specially peculiar. When a woman
brings such a charge against a parson’s son, or a
city magnate, the authorities move official
mountains to discharge defendant without a
stain on his character, but the police discreetly
abstain from pressing a charge of perjury
against the girl. The abduction of the lovely
society notoriety, Clara Barker, is hushed up
by main force. But when the prosecution
against an unimportant male is abandoned by
his self-styled “ victim,” all the law’s myr-
midons wag their heads and threaten
the female. The Law positively put
pressure on the girl to compel her to
swear a criminal offence against—either the
man or herself ! For, if the Law imprisons
her until she does take oaths, she must either
swear that the man is a violator or that she is a
perjurer. And all this to oblige the police !

The Vic. Crown has been induced to prosecute
the ex-secretary of a brewery co. on paltry
charges of embezzlement. Some time back the
co. attempted, very much in vain, to prove
fraud against its old servant, who appeared by
the evidence to have been guilty of nothing
worse than a mixing up of small accounts.
Anyhow, a jury discharged him. Now the
Government is trying to sheet home a couple of
alleged misappropriations to the extent of £55,
instead of leaving the brewery to do its own
prosecuting. Here is a case in which the
retrenching Government might honestly object
to spend a penny, yet its Law dept,
makes a brave show of determination to
“ see justice done. ” Odd! The brewery is a
prosperous concern, the speculation mainly of
a very few people, and its alleged loss is but
trifling. Why doesn’t the Crown try to
procure Queen’s evidence from the two con-
victed Imperial Bank clerks as to the purloin-
ing of the major portion of the missing £20,000?
The two prisoners, who seemingly only got a
little bit of the spoil, would be glad, doubtless,
to get a small reduction of their sentences by
making a clean breast of all they know. In
that case the Crown might do a service to
financial morality, besides procuring vengeance
for a vast number of plundered creditors. The
Crown can’t afford to touch a matter of such
large importance, whilst it readily expends
public money to oblige a brewery-syndicate.
The bounce of the Mercantile Bankers was
especially vigorous on Tuesday of last week. A
deferential Bench was considering the propriety
of an adjournment until such time as the Full
Court had dealt with the latest “objection.”
Nicholson, P.M., provoked the demonstration
by politely enquiring, ‘ ‘ Have the defendants
anything to say ? ” Ye gods !do they ever
cease having something to say! “They all
want to be discharged, I suppose ” (laughter),
said one learned counsel. “My client, Mr.
Millidge, thinks this case is a persecution. He
thinks your worships would be wanting in
respect to the Supreme Court if you proceeded
now that the point is undecided,” thundered
Gaunson, with the air of a man who didn’t
know the Law was being rolled in the gutter all
the time. Other counsel suggested in an airy
way that the hearing of the case should pro-
ceed as usual, because their Clients had particu-
lar business to attend to as soon as they
were acquitted. Finally, Matthew arose and
cleared the whole crowd of suspicion at
one swoop—“ I have simply to say that there
is not a scrap of evidence against any one of
us. ... I don’t wish to pass an opinion on
this case at present, but I may say that I would
like this wretched prosecution to come to an end.”
And Matthew may bet his bottom dollar that
Australia says “ Amen ” to his concluding
remark.
New Yankee smuggling dodge. Put the
cigars in a box with a false bottom and conceal
with venomous snakes.

“ La Mascotte ” has probably never been
more gorgeously put on or more steadily encored
than it was last Saturday at Sydney Lyceum, with
the fetching Nellie Stewart in her rollicking r6leof
Bettina, and the rest making strong first appear-
ances as the other people. The part of the luck-
bringer always seems written round Nellie, but she
has never sung the music so cleverly as on Satur-
day. She and the ever-lovely Ryley sang the
“Glou! Glou ! ” duet as it has never been sung
before in Australia—and in the somewhat ordi-
nary (as written) duet, “This silk attire,” the
same singers made a most dainty minuctish effect
by introducing a pause in every alternate beat.
In the air, “ Pippo, my love,” Miss Stewart sang
with sweetness and feeling, and throughout the
operetta Bettina’s music was altogether ear-.tick-
ling. As Pippo, Ryley was an Arcadian brand of
shepherd in many pairs of faintly-tinted tights,
besides which his acting was just as conscientious
as the histrionic earnestness of a youth who has
to win his way to fame on bow-legs,
* * *
Courtneidge got a hearty reception from
the crowded house when he appeared as an alto-
gether different Rocco from the Roccos gone
before, who were mostly fat and indifferent to their
operatic misery. Courtneidge’s Rocco is a thin
and meagre humorist of a hopeless cast of counten-
ance who never forgets that Laurent has stolen
his Mascotte, and who breathes revengeful asides
in an Orange-and-Home-Rule coloured suit and a
squeak like the doll that says “ mamma.” Lauri
was a red-tufted and altogether funny Laurent,
and the avalanche of puns perpetrated by him
and Rocco made even the d.c. groan aloud.
Tapley, as a somewhat too serious Fritellini,
doesn t obliterate cherished memories of the airy
Wood field in the part, and Violet Varley as
Fiametta was quite small enough for the r6!e of
the fickle princess. “How I would like to shake
her only she’s too little! ” said the jealous Bettina,
and a sympathetic smile went round the audience
which was thinking very much the same thing
itself. Dressed and mounted in tip-top style, “La
Mascotte ” ought to hold the fort with ease until
the Italian Opera Co. fills the Lyceum, for the first
time, with the sound of foreign languages on the
6th. “IPagliacci,” with the ballet “Turqnoisette,”
is to be the season’s pipe-opener.
* * * *
There has been a further revival of “Struck
Oil” at Sydney Royal, with Maggie Moore as
John Stofel’s daughter. People in Sydney have
about given up expecting to see new plays, and
it is as well so, for it saves much disappoint-
ment. With the exception of a certain dead and
forgotten horror at the Opera House, there has
been nothing fresh in that depressed city since
some date so far back that history has lost its hold
upon the particulars thereof, and things seem likely
to continue in this state indefinitely. Not even
a prosperous management can afford to take risks
nowadays, and as for a really unprosperous man-
agement it generally sleeps out in the Domain.
“Struck Oil ” is staged in excellent style, and the
audience seems almost as pleased to see it as
it was when the Dutchman’s little girl first
rose above the horizon many years ago. Mr.
D’Orsay Ogden is a reasonably successful Stofel
with a Dutch accent that is in good repair, and
there is no reason to throw a brick at any
part of the company, with the possible
exception of Mr. West, whose Deacon Skinner is a
monotonous hypocrite and not sufficiently plausi-
ble to impose upon an intelligent community.
Mr. West is almost always the same individual,
and in some cases it would be a blessed relief if he
would be some other individual instead. Maggie
Moore, however, makes up for all deficiencies.
“The Chinese Question” is thrown in by way of
giving the gallery good value for its money. The
gallery, in these times, finds its sixpence with
such extreme difficulty in the bowels of its bell-
bottomed pants that it won’t part with the coin
unless it gets a very large quantity of comedy in
return.
» ♦ » »
The “Hansom Cab” will last out its
second week at Sydney Her Majesty’s. Whatever
may be the deficiencies of the drama, it is at least
an improvement upon Fergus Hume’s shocker
when taken in its raw state, a circumstance which
is owihg, not to any special brilliance in the vehicle
itself, but rather to Miss Kate Bishop’s splendid
acting as the inebriated harridan who is afflicted
with green caterpillars in the attic. Time has
not toned down the garishness of Joe Tolano’s
detective, whose shriekful yet mouldy cos-
tume, and vociferous attempts to look like
an ordinary citizen, are painful to behold. The
other detective, represented by John F. Ford,
is built on an unobtrusive dark-brown plan and
specification, but Mr. Tolano is like nothing on
this earth except it be a sun-flower that has been
out enjoying itself, and come home in a draggled
condition in the morning. “Romany Rye” is to
bereyived on Saturday, with Mrs. Rignold—a lady
who is not seen on the stage nearly so often as her
almirers would like—in her old part as Mother
Shipton.
« * « «
Various miscellaneous shows contrive to
make bread and cheese under more or less hard
circumstances. The Crystal Maze in particular
has got a solid hold upon the community. People
get in there and consider the mysteriousness of
the illusion, and then endeavour vainly to get
out, and walk head-first into mirrors, which look
exactly like open doorways, and bring up with
damaged hats against the glass. The Bulletin
wants to see a big policeman chasing a pickpocket
through the Maze some day. The result ought
to be about the largest quantity of broken glass
on record.

Rawei, the Maori evangelist, now holding
occasional meetings around Sydney, is a mild
variety of sensation, and doesn’t appear to have
caught on very hard. He is an attraction mainly
on account of his bright, dark eye, his hand-
some face, and his wild Maori costume, which
consists principally of door-mat and fringed
blanket. Also, he speaks good English with a
strange, poetic accent, and taken altogether he is
a kissable-looking and wildly-picturesque evan-
gelist. His services consist principally in the
singing of Maori hymns in a sweet voice with
a guitar accompaniment; in weird tales and
anecdotes about the ways of his country-
men, which ways seem to consist mostly
in throwing the house-garbage out of the front-
door and leaving it there to fester and create
disease; in readings from the Maori Bible with
literal translations; and in exhortations, in
the course of which the evangelist’s dark eye
lights up with enthusiasm, and he throws his mat
abroad in a frenzy of eloquence. The gate-money
is to be used to ameliorate the condition of
Rawei’s native village of Pipiriki, on the Wanga-
nui River. The artless evangelist proposes to
settle there in a model home, which the others, in
time, may learn to imitate, and even if they don’t
learn to imitate it Rawei will be a model home to
the good.

The Brough and Boucicault Cos. was re-
ceived at Melb. Princess’ on Saturday with a
sequenceof joyful demonstrations. Ten months’ab-
sence of these dear theatrical friends has made them
so much dearer than ever, that they might have
achieved a huge success in their original characters
of themselves without troubling to act anything
at all. It would be sufficient, on a special occa-
sion like this, for each member of the company to
come forward in turn, and favour the audience
with a familiar smile. In anew play they were
naturally an overwhelming triumph. “ The Ama-
zons,” produced in Sydney some three or four
months back, has not changed its plot in the
meantime. Asa matter of fact, there isn’t much
story to change. Three charming daughters of a
marchioness are reared in knickerbockers and told
to consider themselves substitutes for a like number
of sons, butbeingeventually tracked to their private
gymnasium by a trio of real young men, the
girls receive a maternal order to flee into frocks.
They seem to be drifting towards matrimony at
the finish. The youngest and cheekiest daughter
is the only one who objects seriously to petticoats,
and her sentiments are accounted for by the want
of a reasonable excuse to fall in love. The earl
chappie that she churns in with is decrepit by long
descent; his family has "wavered between dipso-
mania and stringhalt for nineteen generations,
also its scarcity of eyesight dates back to the reign
of William Rufus, and its intermittent palsy is
older than the hills. No girl would willingly wear
frocks for the sake of this hereditary ruin. The
elder sisters are more fortunate in their fel-
lows, for one of them is a French count
who says “ dammitall,” whilst the other browses
on sweet recollections of having carried Mrs.
Brough up a flight of twenty-seven stairs. “ The
Amazons ” is a cheerful joke, and the appearance
of the ladies gives pleasure to all, nevertheless
Pinero’s “romance” doesn’t show his ability to
the greatest advantage. Some of the dialogue
between Mrs. Brough and Titheradge dragged on
Saturday, yet at livelier times it seemed that there
wasn’t enough dialogue to carry the business.
Miss Brenda Gibson fetched the house, ditto Cecil
Ward, and Boucicault, as the perturbed French-
man. Miss Major, plugging away at a piano, in
her “ bloomer ” costume, was a valuable asset, and
the comparatively bashful amazon of Miss Noble
found more favour than her singing did. “The
Amazons ” is booked for a two weeks’ run.
»« » »
At the Bijou a fair sized crowd rolled up
to “ The Private Secretary ”on Saturday. They
laughed, moreover, as though Thornton and uncle
Harwood were expounding the wild absurdity of
this ancient farce for the first time. No piece of
its class wears better than “P.S.’’ The gloss is
off it, but the nap remains intact, and none of the
stitches have given away. Thornton is the same
abject picture of humanity in holy orders that he
was aforetime ; Harwood is one of those crusty,
port-wine uncles who improve with age ; for the
rest there is. not much to be said. The minor
characters, taken in the bulk, are disappointing,
and before Messrs. Arnold and Thornton can
fairly hope to boom their season they will need to
strengthen the company.

In “ L’Amico Fritz” the Italians sang
their last and best to a Melbourne audience. It
is an opera without action or chorus worth men-
tioning—a harmless little love-story thrown upon
the mercy of four principals and a sympathetic
orchestra. Giraud and Signorina Del Torre, one
or other, or both together, are in evidence the
whole time, Caruson and Signorina Mfettler help-
ing when necessary. All four of them showed
their ability to play quiet parts in a light, natural
style, Giraud, in particular, adding much to his
reputation. “ L’Amioo ”is a poetic entertain-
ment, best suited to musicians who have dined
well, but its music will captivate even the general
public that looks for dramatic interest in an
opera.

“ The Heart of Midlothian,” which ap-
peared to be dead-broken a while ago, began to
throb again at the Royal on Saturday. Three
more performances of the tartan drama were
unexpectedly announced, and if no more accidents
occur to the resurrected management they will
follow on with “Is Life Worth Living?” This
solemn problem is worked out with the aid of a
steam roller and other spring novelties.
At Poverty Point.

The Bourke-street theatres would not be complete
without a wonderful cat, which went round the Royal,
Opera House, and Bijou every night to see what the
houses were like. It is said she has just died of grief.
The plot of “Mr. Harris,” an original farcical comedy,
produced in Melb. the other day, was peculiarly expres-
sive of present local conditions. A city magnate is over
his scalp in debt, and a tailor bailiffs him at Christmas
time. Magnate hastens to introduce the bailiff as his
brother from Australia (scene is laid in London) so as to
conceal his identity from a houseful of guests. The
bailiff’s blunders in answering questions re Australia
supply some appropriate lines:—“A buckjumper is a
shirt or jumper worn by the Australian bushmen when
they hunt bucks.” “The Australian natives take so
naturally to spirits of all kinds that they’re called ‘ gins ’
for short.” “Pentridge is a fashionable suburb of Mel-
bourne where the swells and bank-managers reside."
Duncan Macallum, when running a pantomime in
Launceston (Tas.), asked an upholsterer to exhibit in
his shop-window a fine photo, of Sophie Harris. “Do
you ask this in the name of the Lord ?” said the man of
stuffing. Macallum replied readily, “Yes, I do.” A
pause. “Then, in the name of the Lord, I refuse. Your
work don’t belong to Him.” “ Well,” said Mac., getting
fiery, “let me tell you, sir, that when the Day of Judg-
ment comes, you will be a goat—a crumpled-horned
goat, sir, for you don’t follow the command to help your
neighbour.” Macallum missed his opportunity that
time. He should have said, argumentatively, “Well,
my work may not belong to Heaven, but I’m John the
Baptist to Sophie Harris.”
Antoinette Sterling, in one of her Melb. lectures on her
usual unclean topic, suddenly broke down, and throwing
her arms and her drapery abroad, gave a wild shriek of
“Oh, my God!” and then wept bitterly into her hair.
The audience was deeply moved at the obvious genuine-
ness of her emotion. It is depressing therefore to learn
that she did exactly the same thing at Auckland and
half-a-dozen other towns. The shriek, the breakdown,
and the anguished weeping into her heavy mane were
part of the “ business.”
R. S. Smythe has engaged Annie Besant to lecture in

Jennie Lee (“Jo”) is certainly not dead. She was at

whose death is cabled, has lived in vexation
for a generation past through being unable to eclipse his
“Faust." Here is the worst enemy of a maestro or
writer—himself. Once produce a “Robinson Crusoe,"
“ Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” “Tom Brown’s School Days," or
“ Vice Versa,” and you are “cooked."
The wily Musgrove announced that the Blue Ballet at
Melb. Princess would, for the last performance, precede the
opera, in order to give the children a chance to see it. Of
course it was merely a managerial manoeuvre to enable
the coryphees, &c., to pack their airy garments prelimi-
nary to flitting by special to Adelaide.
Parker Hall continues his lesseeship of Melbourne
Royal. His huge mistake was in his preliminary expenses,
which absorbed much capital. But who has ever heard
of a young amateur being successful as a theatrical
manager?
Giraud (an enormously-powerful man, by the way, who
earned high athletic honours in his own country), in
“L‘Amico Fritz,” appears to sport the crimson coat that
Alan Morris used to wear in “La Cigale,” which suits
him very well. Also, his wig is similar to Morris’s, and
the general resemblance between the two men is striking.
In the same opera Mettler, the plump, blonde mezzo-
soprano, looks tasteful as a boy. Brown velveteen jacket
and knickerbockers, and fair hair (probably her own)
curling on the shoulders. Decidedly jimp and jolly.
When the Flintshire was wrecked off Hinchinbrooke
and in sight of Townsville, writes “Scotty the Wrinkler,"
the passengers came in boats to the latter place. What a
queer mixture ! It was Palmer time. Here are those I
remember of the assortment. Blondin, Chevalier (his
sec.), Harry Lyons (agent), Arabella Goddard, Hollv and
Kelly (minstrels), Miss Goddard’s piano (she was afraid to
Kave it) and a barmaid and a Hebrew publican from
Saigon. Everyone took Harry Lyons to he Blondin.
The fat old gentleman in the helmet was only, to the
public, a respectable first-class passenger. Blondin, 1 had
met before, but not M. Chevalier; we drank wine, ver-
mouth and rum respectively. They had just come from
India where H.L. wore a red (natural) moustache, In
deference to the superstitions of Mussulmans, whose
prophet had a carroty beard. Mr. Lyons entered his bed-
room with his tawny “ mo ” and made his exit with black
ditto and finger tips. This was possibly out of respect
for the prejudices of Australian maidens in favour of the
colour. Arabella Goddard (with her hair down) faithful
to the piano, went up town with it in a spring-dray.
Queer idea: Donald Dinnie, the dreariest heavy-weight
lifter that ever took his sraileless way over the earth’s
surface-running a variety show. Nobody ever heard of
there being any variety about Donald, except such as
was afforded by the fact that his knees weren’t quite so
much freckled as his countenance. He lived for years
mainly by throwing brawny tree-trunks known as
“cabers,” and so on. Donald’s variety show consisted
altogether too much of one big man lifting heavy loads
on a stage, and after a while people got tired and
wouldn’t have enthused even had he swung a cow round
his head with one hand.
Once, in the olden times, Ned Holloway was doing
“ Hamlet” round the N.S.W. country districts, and the
idea seized him that the Ghost ought to rise up out of the
ground for the sake of effect. Ned was the Ghost, and he
tried the new idea that night, only the trap wasn't large
enough and he stuck fast. Then he struggled desperately
to get out, but only stuck faster. By his gesticulations,
it was evident that some one was shoving the broad-
beamed spectre from below, and that the spectre was
imploring him to stop, but his voice was inaudible amid
the din. At last, Hamlet, Polonius, the King of Den-
mark, and Laertes seized the vision and gave a long pull
all together, and, as that didn’t shift him and the lan-
guage of the apparition began to be something tremen-
dous, the curtain was dropped. After that the wraith
always came on in the usual way from the wings.
Ventriloquist Teddy Davies, now sharebroking in
Adelaide, did the “Valentine Vox” trick at a recent
mining co. meeting, made it appear that a parson
was vomiting profanity, and caused a merchant to
seem to accuse his best friends of many crimes. A
chaotic chorus of “come outside 1” gave Teddy the
chance to escape.
Rockhampton owns a baritone named Hoyle. At a gar-
den party, a lady magnate was asked how she liked his per-
formance. “ Ho, Hi always did like ’Oyie,” and, turning
to a third party, who, unfortunately, had not caught the
question, “don’t you, Mrs. Blank?” Mrs. Blank:
“ Well, it depends on what sort of oil you mean—castor
or salad ?”

One-act drama, vaguely ascribed to J. L. Toole :
“ Young husband returns to seek his wife ; entering
unperceived, discovers lady exchanging endearments
with a fascinating stranger in evening dress. Silently
he draws a revolver from his breast and fires! Young
woman falls dead. Fires again. Stranger dies. Husband
then adjusts his pince-nez and calmly contemplates hi l
sanguinary work. ‘ Great Soott I ’ he suddenly exclaims
‘lam on the wrong floor 1' " Then he takes his hat anil
departs.
The managers of the leading London music-halls seem
to have formed a league for abolishing the blawsted
middleman, as far as they are concerned. A long-haired
person, named Hugh J. Didcott, recently advertised
that no re-engagements of artists appearing at three halls
could be made without his kind agency. They were to
be addressed only through him, and if a manager desired
to book the services of one or all of them for another
month he would have to call in Didcott to seal the
bargain. Didcott, who is a power in his way, evidently
thought that he had leased the souls of some 24 “artists”
in question, but he was probably out in his reckoning.
Anyway, his advt. elicited a counter advt. notifying that
Didcott was so much sounding brass and tinkling cymbal
of whom no more notice would be taken in any business
arrangements.

life in exhibiting himself in petticoats and a bustle, talk-
ing insensate patter in an Irish brogue, retailing ‘ w-heezes'
that were hackneyed when Columbus discovered America,
representing human nature, so far as that comes into the
question at all, in its most sordid and despicable aspects,
and finally investing himself in a white nightcap and
dressing-gown in order that he may knock a door off its
hinges and tumble on the top of somebody or be tumbled

Italian opera is preferable to She old class of work wherein
a thin slory was spread over three or four hours.
“We were expected,” says Verdi, “to introduce irre-
levant choruses, to elaborate simple situations, and to
write lengthy arias (preceded by absurd recitations) with
all sorts of accessories, instead of keeping to brisk
dramatic action. And now we see spring up a young
composer to give us a serious opera in one act without
all this tra-la-la. I regard it as a happy innovation."
Just so. “Cavalleria” and “Pagliacci” are grand operas
boiled down.

A Bathurst (N.S.W.) paper is objurgating
the penal authorities because, on the second day
of Glasson’s trial for murder, the Sheriff and Mr.
and Mrs. Glasson (so it is alleged) dined together,
“en famille.” It certainly does place a tax on
the stereotyped imagination to realise the picture
of the grim and awesome Sheriff—which be isn’t
either grim or awesome—with a badly-accused
prisoner on his right hand and the poor little 20-
year-old girl wife of the prisoner on his left hand,
doing the honours of the table impartially and
gallantly, _ helping his tentative prey to an-
other choice morsel, or “thanking” him for
another help of cabbage ! also, it is a
lively contrast from the just-quitted court
scene for the defendant to cheerily ven-
ture on, “ The mustard, Mr. Cowper.’’ And,
in-so-far as this privilege is not extended to
all unconvicted prisoners, there is room for com-
But calm considerations of equity and of
the principles professed by Law will show that the
Sheriff, in thus treating Glasson —if he did -so
treat him—was, as the embodiment of the Law,
only dealing with him in such an open, non-com-
mittal way as the Law ought to deal with an
accused man whom it axiomatically declares that
it holds innocent until he is proved guilty.
It is because the Law does not usually
act up to its ethical professions that
it causes surprise when it does act up to some
of them. The denunciatory editor who now
foams upon the Sheriff is merely blinded with the
sandy blight of official usage. ' Further, it seems
difficult to find any valid reason why a wife
should not be permitted to eat and live with her
husband before his trial has ended, if she chooses
to dosft. It is chiefly a matter of taste, dependent
on her decision. If the prevention of facilities
for suicide is one of the reasons assigned, sufficient
replies to that argument will readily suggest
themselves. And it would always be at the wife’s
own option whether she would or would not run
the very open risks that would be attached to
such a situation.

Mr. Wynne’s new Companies Bill, now before
Vic. Parliament, provides that no director or other officer
shall borrow money, or get an overdraft, or have his
bill discounted, or obtain any form of accommodation,
from his own institution. Therefore, if it passes, the
director who wants money in future will have to grant
air overdraft to his brother, or his partner, or his infant,
and then borrow the money indirectly off the infant.
The bill also makes it illegal to declare dividends except
out of profits. But then all the boom companies declared
dividends solely out of profits—paper profits, that is;
in fact, no one ever heard of a company that did other-
wise. Moreover, the trouble isn’t so much the want of
new law as the want of somebody who will enforce the
old law. There is plenty of statute at present to meet
the case of all the boomers in Victoria ; the difficulty lies
with the “Crown ” generally. If Mr. Wynne will introduce
a measure to make the Crown reasonably straight-

In 1889 a great and pious boomer of Melbourne
gave £25,000 to the Baptist Church. He now avers that
he oidy gave it as the agent of a hidden benefactor, but
that is a mere detail ; the staggering feature of the case is
that he borrowed the £25,000 from the luckless Federal
Bank, on security which has since mostly faded away, so
that, whoever nominally gave it, the bank really stands
most of this gorgeous benefaction. And, as the Baptist
Church won’t refund, the Federal will probably continue
to stand it. Most of the big donations which the Church
received in the boom-season seem to have some story like
this attached. Nearly every boomer was seized, about
that time, with a desire to effect a big fire-insurance
on his soul, and he almost always borrowed the premium.

The Freehold Investment and Building 00., of
Melbourne -one of the innumerable Davies “tentacles’’
—is not getting on very favourably with its liquidation.
The uncalled capital consists of £1,381,013, but the most
vigorous efforts of the liquidator have only realised
£17,417. Out of 63,549 shares liable for calls, 43,859 are
held by people who are wholly stone-broke, and from
whom not one solitary coin is realisable; 4149 shares have
paid a composition of something or other in the £, and
have he n released from further liability ; 15,239 have pro-
duced some small instalments, and a faint hope is enter-
tained that something more may yet be recovered ; and
only 302 have been paid up in full. The 00. wants
£426,000 in calls from one Davies, £215,000 from another
Davies, £245,000 from another member of the same family,
£139,000 from three of Davies’ insolvent companies, and
£71,000 from three other persons. Save a few small shop-
keepers and the like, with ten or twenty shares apiece,
everybody connected with the Freehold Co. seems hope-
less or thereabouts.

The Friendly Societies Act Amendment Bill,
now before N.S.VV. Parliament, is an innocent little
measure which consists mainly of two provisions—that
the accounts of all Friendly Societies shall be kept in a
certain prescribed form, instead of in the higgledy-pig-
gledy fashion which usually prevails, and that all such
sicieties shall be subject to inspection by the Registrar
or his deputy. Considering the disgracefully-insolvent
condition of a large percentage of N.S.W. Friendly
Societies, and the fact that 99 per cent, of the members
are so ignorant of accounts as to be at the mercy of the
officials, these precautions come none too soon. Never-
theless, some legislators apparently see in the Bill the
beginning of a stem which will one day lead to all-round
State inspection of insurance companies, building
societies, banks, and similar institutions; and they
object vigorously. Mr. Garvan, in particular, declared
that a general system of State audit would create a
i evolution, that it was a brutal jumping with both feet
on the rights of man, and that it would inevitably lead
to “ corruption and bad management.” In a country
where, under the private audit system, most of
the banks and finance institutions have Just
burst up, it takes a considerable amount of
gall, even in the manager of a peddling industrial
insurance concern, to suggest that anything is going to
lead to worse management than the kind which the
country already suffers under. It would take a lot to
make N.S.W. financial institutions more corrupt than
they have been for a long time past. As to the “ revolu-
tion ” which Mr. Garvan sees in the near future, it has
been wanted for a good many years. Some kind of revolu-
tion which will make the balance-sheet of Thomas Smith
Richardson’s bank not quite so glaring as it used to be,
for instance, and will prevent future land-bank managers
buying blood-horses out of the deposits.
# * *
“No Government inspection . . . . can
do what the members of the society don’t do for them-
selves,” said Garvan. In other words, when the unsus-
pecting bricklayer or coal-heaver who pays in his
subscription every week, and never sees the accounts,
and couldn’t understand them if he did see them, doesn’t
find out the discrepancies in the accounts, no Government
expert could find them out. Which is a comforting
theory for the man who keeps the accounts, only when tha
Government expert comes after the insolvency he is
found out and gets his five years in gaol all the same—un-
less he has previously got away per coal-ship to Valparaiso.
The chief d fference, when the State audit comes along,
is that he will be found out while there is still time for the
discovery to be of some service to the public, whereas now
he is only found out when the money is all gone, and the
depositors have begun to commit suicide.

One feature which has passed almost unnoticed
in the dismal history of the Federal Bank is the fact that
many of its worst advances—the ones that killed it—were
made, not during the boom fever, as is commonly repre-
sented, but after the boom had practically burst. The
burst really took place in the beginning of 1889, and after
that everything was going downhill. The shrinkage was
so steady and continuous that every business man could
realise that the bottom was a long way off, and that, in
lending money on mortgage, it was necessary to make
allowance for all sorts of possibilities in the way of future
depreciation.
* * *
Yet it was at this time that the Federal—which
had really got through the boom in a solvent condition—
started to lend vast sums to all sorts of death-stricken
land-banks on securities which were every day becoming
more hopeless. They were all nominally worth the money
advanced at the time, but in many cases it was only
nominally ; if an attempt had been made to sell them the
market was so crippled that the very attempt would have
diminished their value enormously, and while they
remained on hand they were going bad every day in a
way that was plainly visible to the naked eye. It was
like advancing money on a diseased bullock which
was already too far gone to sell, and which was bound to
become useless dead meat if kept on hand. The Federal
didn’t die of the boom ; it died through lending money,
much of it to James Munro’s land-banks, at boom valua-
tions, when everybody in his sober senses knew that the
boom was past recovery.

The most persistent hummer in London of Aus-

yields, anddivs., and to deplore the apathy of London

in London for transfers, payment of divs. and calls, like
South African mines. Shareholders must come first;
London offices will follow, as for instance, Mt. Morgan and

A broker writing from London foreshadows a
time when more English attention will be given to the
good gold-mines of Australia. He urges miners to secure
larger reserves before paying divs., so as to equalise them,
and not pay 4s. one month and 2s. the next. The Bulle-
tin, however, would point out that steady divs. are not
equalised by reserves, but by the uniform value of the ore
crushed. When crushings fluctuate, as in many gold-
mines, so should divs. If they were equalised by reserves
it would be impossible to tell at a glance how much was
taken from the crushing, and how much from the re-
serve. By all means let dividends rise and fall with
crushings. # # #

The art of fading away gradually and judiciously
is a great essential. People always want to inquire into
the bank which pays a big dividend and then shuts up
with a bang. The right way is first to stop the dividend
and speak regretfully about depreciation. Then, next
half-year, take part of the reserve-fund. Then take
the rest of the reserve-fund. Then make a call.
After that make another call. Last of ail, close up.
And by that time it is safe to assume that the people who
have energy enough to make any trouble will have trans-
ferred their shares to dummies or otherwise got_ out, and
won’t say anything lest they should draw attention to the
bogus transfer, while the dummies will say nothing for
the same reason.

Murchison (W.A.) goldfield comprises a pro-

Not one-fourth of the area has yet been prospected, yet
good gold centres have been found, and are being
developed along a route 300 miles long. “ Week by week
fresh discoveries are being made equal to anything dis-
covered in the past—more especially at the Mount Mag-
net, the Island, and for a radius of ten miles around Cue.
At and around the latter place there cannot be less than
500 men, and there also, at present, gold-bearing reefs are
being pegged out almost daily. A fact which goes to
demonstrate the value of the reefs is that the reefers are
able to develope them from the returns obtained from the
crude method of ‘dollying.’ Another fact worth know-
ing is that, up to date, none of these reefs show any signs
of cutting-out in depth, though some of the shafts are

Tributors at the White Cliffs (N.S.W.) opal
field (worked almost solely on the tribute prin-
ciple) complain that a large number of the leaseholders
carry things with a high hand. Each tributor, before
commencing work—generally on halves—is required to
sign a document whereby he agrees to hand over each
evening all the opal he has found during the day. He
never again sees the gem thus given up, and hears no
more of it until the leaseholder hands him a cheque
which represents (say) half the alleged proceeds. The
individual who sits on the rail disposes of the gem,
renders an account to himself, and divides the proceeds
of the sale between himself and tributor, the latter
having to accept the boss's word that the gem brought a
low price and that the division has been faithfully made.
# • #
Thus, it is said, one tributor, working on halves,
found ISOoz. opal— his share amounted to £2; another
found 40o z.—his share, £2. Sometimes the boss intimates
that the gem given to him is unsaleable—tributor’s
share, nil. If the men object and desire to see an
account of the sales there is, it is averred, trouble ;
unemployed tributors may be had by the cart-
load. Another game is to get rid of a tributor who
happens on a rich run of the gem and put on wage-men
until the pocket has worked out. Some day there will
be an eruption at the White Cliffs, after which there will
be clouds of dust rising on the horizon, each of which will
mark the progress of a leaseholder scooting along the
road to Wilcannia.

waste—plenty engine-power, and every facility for
handling ore, save stampers. No doubt a 20-head mill,
erected by the Copper Co., would pay well. Why don’t
they try?

Some men who went to Zeehan and Dundas as
champion mining boomers, remained there, and are now
well employed as smelters and miners. They went to
“ scoff ” and stayed to work. Their reformation is more
gratifying to others than to themselves.

Really good news from the Raub Australian,
gold mine : “Crushing finished ; 1750 tons, 24790 z.”

Machinery erected in haste is usually repented
at leisure. The Zeehan and Dundas silver ores are now
smelted all over the world— Queensland, Hamburg, Erie-
burg, and elsewhere.

A scheme has teen not wisely but too well laid
in Melb. to boom the Vesuvius g.m., Charters Towers.
The plan of the field, with a flowing description of the
big mines, has been published at advertising rates in the
Age. At the meeting of shareholders the chairman said
a great deal about the big C.T. mines but precious little
about the Vesuvius,

The Charters Towers mines paid the State this
year in div.-duty, £38,000; Gympie, £10,000; Mt.
Morgan alone, £51,250. The div.-duty is a good, healthy
tax in Queensland.

Rumour that a big Bendigo speculator was
clearing out his Dagraar’s, Johnson’s Reefs, and Garden
Gully’s, together with the drop in the fortnight’s yields
from each mine, caused shares to fall hea\ ily last week.

Six weeks ago, over 300 miners arrived on the
Randt. Few were able to get work at once, but they
contracted for taking out big ore-hodies, and offered to
take blocks on tribute. The Kaffir is the European
miner’s local bugbear. Wages for white miners, £4 10s. ;
hours, 12.
* • •
You hear hardly a word about the Bendigo
deep duffers. Two crosscuts driven respectively from
the Victory, 2360, and Pandora, 2460, levels, have failed to
find any stone, and shares along the line have dropped.

Better without a N.S.W. Mining on Private

Dry weather at Broken Hill has revived the
Broken Hill water-supply. A few' weeks ago these shares
could be had for 2s. ; present price, ss. 6d., and with a
dry summer they should see par. A chance for the

Floating Bendigo mines is once more a common
occurrence. One of the last, Herbel’s on the Comet line,
capital, £32,000 in that number of shares (ss. on applica-
tion), £BOOO of w'hioh the owners take ; 7500 shares taken
up in 48 hours. Reef showing a great width, crushing
average lOdwts., and can be pub through in any quantity

The Randt is the biggest reefing goldfield in the
world by reason of big things ; big, burly niggers who
work for 3s. and 4s. a day, big reefs crushed in big bat-
teries with big stamps. There are over 2000 heads belting
away at rock averaging lOdwts., or £1 17s. 6d. per ton,
and which costs all round less than 20s. to put through.
The monthly profit is about £150,000.

Blayney is said to be full of distressed men
awaiting the opening of Annandale estate. Two men got
under lOOozs. gold there recently, and the owner is cut-
ting the estate into 200 claims, for which he proposes charg-
ing £1 a month each! £5O a week for working gold
vested in the State 1

It is always hard to get at the worst features of
a mine when the yields suddenly flop. The Victory slump
was a shock to many, and, as far as one can judge, it will
be some time before very big cakes are again the order of
the day. However, there is one large ore-reserve on tha
boundary of the Brilliant, and the mine haa other good
prospects around it.

The Oremorne (Sydney) coal-bore is now down
over 2800 feet. The borers are getting heavy Govt,
assistance, and should they strike coal they will make an
immortal pile, as to them will belong, under practically a
perpetual lease, all the coal under Port Jackson—subject
only to a Govt, royalty of 6d. per ton. The coal will ba
simply lifted out of the shaft into the ships alongside.
What a “mug” the State is! The Colo Valley water-
force, and all the coal under Sydney Harbour, simply
given away!

Another good tribute at Parkes—Dayspring
mine, 107 tons for 1430 z. A heap of gold was taken from
this mine years ago. When last worked the reefs split
against a big mullock “horse,” and the co. cried go.
Tributors have gone through and have now a reef two or
three feet thick.

Latest Northern yarn re contract system. Advt.

“Thank you, gentlemen,” said would-be employer, “I

wanted to be sure that he didn't over-charge me.
Brothers, you know, are apt to take advantage, ain’t
they ? ” Smiled pleasantly on the audience as he finished,
but a burly contractor stepped out: “Say, mates, allow
me to introduce you to the meanest man in Queensland.
He’s invited us from all parts of , made us lose a
day’s work so that he may be able to grind down his own

From a Brisbane paper’s special correspondent’s
report of a Gympie mine : “ A better idea can be formed
as to the importance of the discovery,” &c. ; “ a rich and
evidently a highly auriferous belt of stone exists which
will probably occupy some years to work out.” “Magni-
ficent country;” “large auriferous deposits awaiting
development,;” “some very good stone has been
broken;” “there is a considerable body of crushing
stuff, and at nearly every point gold can be seen in the
quartz,” &c., &c. Shares in such a mine should be cheap
at £5. Yet the same paper quotes them ; Sellers, BJd.
which knocks all the poetry out of it!

IMITATED !
BUT UNRIVALLED
AND UNEQUALLED.
CLEMEN I S TONIC is a scientific chemical
food and restores the tissue wasted by the voca-

remedy for neuralgia, nervousness, weakness,
debility, liver complaint, dropsy, and chronic
indigestion.
I< LE I CHER’S PILLS cure heartburn, back-
ache, headache, liver torpidity, dyspepsia and all
complaints of the stomach and bowels.
I hose two remedies have been thoroughly
tested in all the hot countries of the world.
They are sold at a price within the reach of all
people. Evidence is forwarded free on receipt of
name and address that will satisfy the most
sceptical as to their virtues. They are sold
everywhere, but care must be taken that the
genuine are obtained or the money and time are
wasted and the disease so much the more serious.

THE LUCKIEST AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR.
(Sylvester Brown, of Bayley’s Reward Claim, Coolgardie.)
Murderer Deeming, about five years ago,
presented a clock of his own invention to a Syd-

long while, but on the day Deeming was hanged
it “stopped short,” and has not gone since. That
is the story, anyhow.
Carter, M.L.A. (Vic.), whose brutal and
unfounded insult to ex-Premier Shiels has

A member of Sydney City Corporation has

then the blatant lawyer-ex-butcher.
A correspondent tells The Bulletin that
“at ‘Salmon’ Wilson’s Yanko Station, near

The Sydney press hath it that the new
Bishop of Grafton and Armidale is likely to be
parson Piddington, of “ Freetrade turkey ”

recourse to recent proselytes to fill up its most
important positions.
Premier Kingston (S.A.) at one time

When Moss, the

his island after a recent
visit to Maoriland, the
inhabitants presented
him with six good-look-

token of esteem, and the
girls were to be his per-

infested the Pacific, the
harem was rejected with
loathing.

The late Dr. Mac-

Mr. W. L. Rees, ex-M.H.R. of Maori-
land, and joint author with his daughter of the
“ Life of Sir George Grey,” does not stop to count
the cost of a good action. Years ago, when a
very poor man, he adopted the orphan children of
a friend who died penniless, and from that day to
this has brought them up as his own.
Humbug or satirist? Apropos of some
chilled Sydney schnapper lately sent home by a
Sydney man, Lord Carington remarked that the
sample he received compared most favourably
with English salmon. Ye gods! Creme de Bouzy
compared most favourably with Pommery and
Greno ! Tanglefoot compared most favourably
with Bass ! Carington compared most favourably
with Hercules Robinson !
“ Old ” Governor M‘Gregor, of New
Guinea, is said to be the most uncouth of Aus-
tralasian Governors. Recently he went aboard a

Stuffing his fingers into his ears, ho exclaimed :
“Dom your pop-guns—what the are ye
makkin’ a noise for?” Recently his Chief Secre-
tary told the Governor’s wife that her husband
was the most uncouth man he knew. She said
she would tell Mac. at the dinner-table, but the
C.S. was before her with the story, at which old
Mac. only laughed.
Cardinal Moran is bringing out four
Chinese priests from the Propaganda College at
Thirty years ago, writes a correspondent
to Phe Bulletin, the late Archbishop Coold, of
Melbourne, got one from the same source, who
travelled about the country preaching to the
Heathen Chinee, but with little effect. Father
Ah Lee was a fine Gregorian musician, and for a
time was a great attraction at St. Francis’, Melb.,
where he sang high mass every Sunday. He
trained a choir of boys at St. Patrick’s, but
falling into bad health returned to China, after
ten years experience in Australia. He never
mastered English. When he had to announce
altar, “Next Wednesday will be Fast

speech a couple of days before.
Jamestown, S.A., when Dr. Cockburn
settled there, 20 years ago, was situated on a flat,

yau call a place where many trees grow?”
Youngster (promptly): “Jamestown.’’ Virtue
sometimes has its reward even in this life.

THE LATE FRANCIS ADAMS.
The contract price for building the female
penitentiary at Pentridge (Melb.) was =£4o 000.
The contractor claims =£Bo,ooo extra, in considera-
tion of delays and breakages of bargain “by the
department.’’ If this claim be proved, then what
price official estimates ?
Parson Coffey, of Wellington (M.L.),
having been asked to deliver a sermon “on the
hours of labour of the working classes, loftily
replied that shortening the hours would “inter-
fere with trade,” and “ pointed out that, by fore-
going such luxuries as tobacco and beer, working
men might considerably ameliorate their own con-
dition and that of their helpmates.” There is yet
another way—do without Coffey.
Thus Pearson, the pirate, in one of his
journalistic dust bins :
I believe that if H.R.H. the Prince of Wales made a
square offer to resign his prospect of the British Crown
on condition that the Yankees made him Emperor of the
U.S., he would be crowned within a month.
The only ground for the above is in the fact that
America enthused wildly over the other Ang'o-
elephant, Jumbo.
At a wayback Q. station the manager
works like a slave and lives like a nigger. He
usually retires about 10 p.m., and is up and about
by 330 a.m. A short while since, being in need
of an extra hand, he employed a traveller who
came along and sent him out to a hut some miles
distant. At the end of a week the new hand
turned np at the station for rations, carrying with
him his blanket. After getting his tea, sugar,
«fec., said he to the boss r “ May I leave my
blanket here in the store?” “Leave it here!”
exclaimed the boss; “why, you’ll need it with
you. ’ “Oh, no I won’t,” replied swaggy, “I’ve
got a bit of saddle-cloth out there and that will
do me for all the sleep I get on this blessed run.”
Much interest is attached to the coming
November ballot of the Columbian Land Distri-
bution, now before the public. The whole of this
ballot is to be concentrated on the fertile Nam-
brok estate, in Gippsland (Vic.), which embraces
15,000 acres of fine agricultural land—mostly con-
sisting of well-grassed, rolling downs. With
Swiss scenery and an Italian climate, with equable
and sufficient rainfall and never-failing streams
fed from the generous crests of snow-clad moun-
tains, Gippsland is the Goshen of Victoria, and
the cutting-up and distribution of the Narnbrok
estate is an event now being most eagerly
watched by Gippslanders themselves. The allot-
ment of a whole ballot to Narnbrok increases the
odds in favour of those risking a small deposit on
the chance of gaining an agricultural prize, and
the details of the scheme given in another column
show tiiat the best interests of shareholders are
being carefully studied. Besides affording agri-
cultural scope, Gippsland is a rich grazing country,
its stock having already a long-standing reputa-
tion in the markets, while its dairies and creameries
are noted for yielding good results. Its mineral
treasures are not meagre, its boundaries in-
cluding several well-known proclaimed gold-
fields. It possesses several important towns—
Sale, Bairnsdale, Bruthen, &o. The Narnbrok
ballot comprises 28.5 properties, varying in value
from one worth =£30,000 to 100 properties worth
=£24, each. Ihe ballot is to take place “ without
fail next month. It will be drawn under the
supervision of P. P. Labertonche and C. M. Officer
(Melb.), Christopher Wade (Adelaide, S.A.), and
Captain J. Whitney (Auckland, M.L.), in con-
junction with not less than 10 shareholders, and
in the presence of press representatives, so that
the bona-fides are above cavil. All communica-
tions should be addressed to the Columbian Land
Distribution Co., c/o R. Newton and Co. Bris-
bane (Q.), or c/o J. H. Astrop, Marlborough

several members of my family have been taking
Clements Tonic with advantage, a sister of mine
was suffering some time ago from a severe attack
of indigestion, when we found that the medicine
she received from the doctor was not doing her
any good, wo resolved to try Clements Tonic, as
we had heard so much about it; by the time my
sister had taken two bottles of Clements Tonio
she had entirely recovered, but to make sure of it
she took another bottle, and I am happy to say
she has required no medicine since. I am only
too happy to add my testimony to the number
you have already received ; no family should be
without Clements Tonic. I believe it is one of
the best household remedies in existence.—l

The enthusiasm which N.S.W. Speaker

Copeland, Minister of Lands, intends,
it is said, going to Monaro to oppose burly Harry
Dawson, M.P. Of these two heavy-weights, The
Bulletin will back Dawson.
G. D. Clark, M.P. (N.S.W.), voted in
over 400 divisions last session. Multiply that
number by three and you will get an approximate
idea of the number of speeches he made.

An escape of gas caused the suspension of
a recent morning sitting of S.A. Legislative

G. H. Reid, the N.S.W. Opposition
leader, enters up as they appear all figures and
facts which seem to him to affect the fiscal con-
troversy, and professes to be thus able, at an
hour’s notice, to meet any case his opponents can
produce.
If a certain Australian railway case ever
gets into court some singular evidence may come
out. It is said that a one-time popular official
will be accused by the Crown of collusion to a
sensational degree.
“Men deserve the contempt with which
they inspire one, I have put some gold lace on

immediately become what I wish them.”— Napo-

The tuft-hunt-
ing little medico,
Dr. Renw i c k,
who, by grace of
Parkes, is sup-
posed to represent
N.S. Wales at
Chicago Fair,
blew himself out
on that recent
burlesque occa-
sion there, “ Brit-
ish Empire Day.”
He vouched for
the unswerving
and grovelling
loyalty to . the
Crown of ail Aus-
tralia and particu-
larly of his own
province, andcited
the Soudan Don-
key as a proof
thereof. The Bul-
letin declines to
accept Renwick
seriously. His
official appoint-
ment was a one-
man act that robs
his position of
any really repre-
sentative merit;
some of its con-
sequences were
repudiated by
the succeeding
Government ; his
main privilege is
the odious one
of spending else-
where much money greatly needed at home ;
otherwise, the fact that he is calling himself
“N.S. Wales” in Chicago is of no interest to
anyone in N.S. Wales—not even to his suburban
tenants, whose rents, it is said, are just as regularly
enforced as ever they were. The doctor is simply
blood-poisoning for a title.
“ Above all things, good policy is to be
used that the treasure and moneys in a State be
not gathered into a few hands, for otherwise a
State may have a great stock and yet starve : for
money is like muck—nob good, except it be
spread.’’— Bacon.
Close on £BOO,OOO is in dispute between

S.A. Advertiser, when Jeff. Stow was
editor, was a single-tax paper, likewise the
Register under Medway Day. Both now oppose

Nicoll, a Northern river M.L.A., crossed
the N.S. W. border into Queensland a week ago,
and told the Brisbaneites that Clarence and Rich-
mond sugar-growers would never take a Kanaka
into their canefields, and that still they would
make the industry pay.
Re vote for Thrift. Years ago a N.Q-
man sold his daughter to a Chinaman and invested
proceeds of aforesaid sale in town allotments. By
virtue of property thus obtained he secured a vote
for Thrift, which he has always used—needless to
say—in the interests of Law and Order.
The London interviewer’s statement that
Mr. Gilbert Parker had represented himself in the
Modern Babylon as one time “ associate editor ”
of S.M. Herald, produced, when read in the office
of that journal, a long exhalation of breath dying

In connection with the appointment
Mr. John Mair, ex-secretary of the Pastoralists’
Union in Melbourne, to the office of validating
officer under N.S.W. Government, it is pertinent
to ask what Govt, billet can be provided for the

Take any half-dozen N.S.W. members of
Parliament you meet and ask them the difference

Alas! with what little knowledge the world is

Miowera wreck once more carpets the

“ C. J. ” suggests, apropos of Col. Temple-
ton’s election for Benalla (Vic.) per the returning

the returning officer should place his marked

has voted, such paper not to be used save in the
event of a tie.”
S.A. Supreme Court is wroth because two
Labour members, sworn-in as amateur magis-
trates, have persistently neglected to forward the
half-guinea fee for which they were given credit.
The chief official says severely that he was under
the impression that the laws were binding “ even
upon Labour members.”
A wind-indicating Argus straw :
The Labour party, to do any good, will need to bo
represented by young men like Messrs. Kingsbury and
Hell, both gradual! s of first-class universities, and both
in sympathy with the large liberal movement that is
working like y<ast throughout Australasia.

N.S.W. Premier Dibbs announces a deficiency in his Financial Statement,
but promises a surplus for the year 1894.
That good old Tory, Shrimski, M.L.C., of
Maorilaud, stonewalled the Bill regarding a
weekly half-holiday for shop-assistants, on the
ground that “ho had worked for sixteen or
eighteen hours a day himself, and had raised him-
self to these crimson benches by his own indus-
try.” “ These gory benches ” was probably what
he meant.
Archdeacon Gunther hopes to see Parra-
matta made the Washington of Federated Aus-
tralia. On the ground of early associations
Parramatta has some claim to the distinction, but
would such clans as the Thorpes and Byrnes ever

of being the federal city, has no voice in the
national elections.
Certain members of N.S.W. Parliament,
who have hitherto succeeded in doing nothing for
the unemployed, are now in determined evidence
in the interests of that body. Why?—apart from
the fact that they hope to use the unemployed as

them, asked this question a few days ago,

Q. Govt, pays a commission to persons
introducing buyers of Crown lands! Thus
Powers, M.P. A bank, anxious to consolidate
its securities, and having a customer who had a
considerable overdraft, might say to him ‘We
want 20,000 acres of land ; you can get us that at
10s or ss. an acre. Barn a commission and wipe
out your overdraft. How beautiful .
Colonial Secretary Tozer (Q.) braggingly
told a Sydney press interviewer that the ‘'con-
tingentvote” secured the true representation of
the majority. The. humbug of pretending, that a
majority of the people can possibly be represented
in a country where the Fat Man has a plural
bricks-and-mortar and allotment vote, and where
nomadic manhood is disfranchised, is stupendous
—even for Towzer.
Mr. E. Pulsford, the
restless essayist and fiscal
lecturer, modestly re-
marked the other day
that he has but one
enemy in the world—
Ignorance. His own?
It is generally under-
stood that Speaker Bent
(Vic.) has intimated that
he wouldn’t mind going
to London as Agent-
General. The Bulletin
trusts he may get the
billet. The bull-voiced
Bent roaring up and
down in England, ob-
truding his broad, oh a-
ginous presence on evei y-
body, and putting a copi-
ous bow-leg and shape-
less foot on everybody’s
dignity would be an in-
spiriting spectacle. If
anything would stop the
influx of borrowed money
Bent would do it. The
capitalist who would
lend anything to Victoi ia
after seeing Speaker Bent
would deserve to lose i t.
Premier Patterson
thinks, or professes to
think, that Victoria is on
the eve of another boom.
The Bulletin hereby
bets that Patterson will
be feebly masticating his
dinner with one lonesome
tooth long before that
boom arrives, and if ho
isn’t aware of the fact ho
hasn’t sense enough for
his billet. Booms are
very far apart in these
days —twenty years apart
at the lowest estimate;
and it is to be hoped they
will soon be 20,000 years
apart instead of twenty.
The man who seriously
wants a boom, with all
the smash and beggary
and suicide which always
follows in its wake, is a
public enemy calling
down curses upon the
land.
The KS.W. Ministry, fearful of its con-
stitutional position—afraid, in fact, that legally it
and the Assembly are absolutely non-existent-
pushes forward Federation as a “spar for wind.
It knows perfectly well that if it passed the Mining
on Private Property Bill and sent it to the Council
the latter body would deny that there was now
any such thing as a Legislative Assembly, and act
on its denial.
Premier Kingston has written sharply to
the Secretary of State concerning his discourtesy
in neglecting to reply to “the reasonable and
respectful” request of S.A., to be allowed to
economise by running Way as Governor after
Kintore’s departure. All he has heard m reply is
that Kintore, “against his will,” has been induced
to stay another year, in order, it is believed, that
the people’s wishes may be baulked.
Sydney Evening News considers India
too near these shores for any danger to it to be
a matter of indifference to us. That means that
Australia is to keep a warlike eye on Russia as
the latter advances on Herat. Is there an acre of
British territory in any part of the world, or is
there a square mile of land or water anywhere
that does not, on this line of thought, call for the
display of Australia’s flaming sword?
Dr. Ren wick, the N.S.W. Chicago-show
commissioner, boasted at Chicago (U.S.A.) that
he so worked upon the feelings of an old lady
re the grandeur of being a slave unit in an Empire
instead of being a free unit in a Republic that
he could hardly restrain her from shipping from
the States forthwith. The doctor practises
malevolent hypnotism, then? “Loyalty to the
Crown” is evidently one of the hysterical diseases.
Honesty is the first political principle that
a constituency should look for in its member of
Parliament. If Victoria followed this rule there
wouldn’t be more than half-a-dozen members of
the present Assembly returned again at next
election. Every new candidate should adopt for
his war-cry the fact that his corruption hasn’t
been proved as yet. “ Vote for Brown-Jones, on
the off-chance that he isn’t a * rotter ’ like your last
man ! ”
Frank Cotton claims the right of individual
judgment, and will not take orders from the
N.S. W. L ihour “ machine.” Under the machine
system, for instance, he would have had to vote
down the Colo Valley grab, on which, by a strange
satire, so many of the party whose shibboleth is
“natural opportunities for the people” smile
benignantly. Cotton’s action in bolstering up this
political iniquity has discounted him by 99| per
cent, as a sincere Democrat.
Our old North Queensland friend Pritchard
Morgan. M.P. (writes a London correspondent of
The Bulletin), the other day, wanted to know
from the Government whether it was true that
a noble lord, who has long been a recognised
lunatic in a private asylum, was temporarily
released for the special purpose of voting in the
House of Lords against the Home Rule Bill. The
mere fact that the Speaker would not permit the
question to be * asked was probably sufficient
answer for most people.

after money and victuals, and there was not the
vestige of any lofty sentiment in it.
Brisbane (Q.) Courier :
The necessity of placing the last Q. loan upon London
market at the beginning <f the current year was in
obedience to a bank requirement and not a Treasury neccs
sity. And there is reason to believe that the fact was
even better known in London than here.
The Q. Auditor-General’s last annual report dis-
closes this peculiar fact still more clearly. On
June 17, ’92, the Q. Govt, borrowed £400,000 from
the Bank of England (repaid by sale of
Treasury Bills in October); in December, ’92, it
borrowed <£ooo,ooo (repaid by sale of inscribed
stock in February and March, ’93). Also :
On the suspension of the Q.N.B. in May ’93, the Bank o*
England advanced £4OOO to the Agent-General, which en-
abled the current expenses in London to be met.
“Popping” the country’s shirt! And all this
time the Q. Govt, had a “credit balance” with
the Q.N.B. of 2h or 3 millions sterling! By the
sacred Three Balls! does the MTlgrab Govt,
exist for any other purpose than the salvation of
banks? _
Dear Bulletin, —I have just read of the
death of Francis Adams. The scissors and the
thief starve the able penman. The writer must
fuse, i.e.. burn or melt, before he can put emotions
upon paper which will similarly affect his readers.
This fusion is fatal. And in the cruel crucible of
the gifted mind, the merciless retort smelts down
the health till death relaxes the torture.—Ds
Bakkae, Nelson Creek, Maoriland.

GoM discoveries. Very rich fields have
been opened at Southern Cross, Coolgardie, Mur-
chison, &c., in West Australia, which will be one
of the greatest gold-producing countries of the
world. Land in Perth and Albany, the principal
cities, is ridiculously low in price, and must cer-
tainly increase very much in value in the next
few years. One of the best investments at present
time is to secure a few lots. The Intercolonial
Investment Co., Ltd., 300 Pitt-street, Sydney,
offers exceptionally well-positioned blocks from
.£lO each on very easy terms, or for cash,
guaranteed title. The company has been estab-
lished in Sydney and Perth for many years, and
is well known throughout the colonies for straight
dealing. The manager is Mr. W. J. Douglas,

Dear Bulletin,—l gathered from a book
I read the other day that the Englishman has a
fixed and unalterable idea that he is the only
European that bathes regularly. The Mel-
bourne Argus London correspondent remarked,
the other day, that the English delegates to the
Socialist Conference in Switzerland were the only
ones who bathed. I will not inquire into the
relative degrees of cleanliness of J. Bull and his
neighbours, but will relate an experience of my
own in England. I landed in London from
Australia in October, 1890, and put up at A.’s
Hotel, Fleet-street, right in the middle of the
place. It is a very good hotel, containing, I
should say, 60 rooms—and only one bath-room,
and this is not rushed. Carrying out my Austra-
lian habits, I bathed every morning. I was shown
to the bath by a gaunt female known as the
“bath-woman.” This seems the regulation. The
second morning she seemed surprised, but said
nothing. The third morning she left me standing
outside the bath-room while she went and con-
ferred in whispers with the chambermaid. After
a while she reluctantly got the bath ready.
The fourth morning she brought up the
manager who laughed at her, and whispered
something rapidly, of which I only caught the
word “Australian.” From this out the “bath-
woman ” made no protest, but regarded me with a
pitying glance. Down in the bars the barmaids
would slyly point at me when they thought I
wasn’t looking, and I found that I was regarded as
a very harmless lunatic or eccentric Australian,
whose hallucinations led him to take baths every
morning. At the end of a week my bill was
brought to me, and amongst the items was—
“ Baths, Bs.” I was staggered. I went to the
clerk and demanded to know what the devil they
meant by charging for baths. She said it was
customary. I then asked whether the English-
man bathed, as a rule, every morning, or whether
it was an event in his lifetime. She said they al-
ways charged Is. for cold baths and Is. 6d. for
warm ; as a rule boarders bathed once a week.
I immediately paid ray bill, called for my luggage,
and after tipping the waiters, the chambermaid,
the night-porter, the bath-woman, the boots, the
errand-boy, the clerk, and a host of others (all of
whom stood in a row as I was going out to see mo
off), I drove off and took chambers in Buckingham
Palace Road, next door to a swimming bath, where
I could astonish the attendant by publicly swim-
ming every morning during the winter. I find
that in every hotel the custom is the same, and a
visitor is fined Is. for keeping himself clean. After
all I don’t think the Englishman has much to say
to his continental neighbour on the score of clean-
liness. —Yours, Locust.

A cross-examining lawyer in the Sydney
Insolvency Court, the other day, was completely
OUT BACK.—SEASONABLE ADVICE.
HATLESS WAYFARER: “Any house ’bout here, mate? I’ve been poisoned.
Lord! I’ll die directly!”

hard ground.”
baffled by the impermeable fogginess of a bank-
rupt. Lawyer: “Do you gamble?” Insolvent,
with solemn expressionlessness: “ No. I’ve
never been on a racecourse since I married.”
Lawyer: “Now, sir, be very careful in your
answer. Don’t forget, sir, that you are on your
oath. Do you—er, excuse me now, but it is my
duty to ask you—is it, er, a fact that you keep
two establishments ?” The insolvent’s face under-
went no change, but he paused stolidly for several
breaths, and then replied with matter-of-fact
gravity: “ Oh, dear, no. Although my wife has
been very ill and my children also wanted a
change, I haven’t been able to take them any-
where, not even for a trip up the mountains, for
the last five years.” Here all the flash little
attorneys in Court sniggered in their chests, and
nudged each other, and winked and raised their
eyebrows amusedly, as persons aide to say—“ Ha,
ha ! We all know what it is to keep two establish-
ments, thank Heaven!” The cross-examiner
returned to the assault: “I am afraid that—er—
possibly you don’t quite understand me.” (Here
the insolvent tried painstakingly to look intelli-
gent.) “What I meant was—er —Do you—er—
that is to say, do you, or did you ever, maintain,
or help to maintain, another lady?” With a
flash of thankful understanding, the response
came briskly ; “ Dear me, no. My wife and
I have never had a disputing word since we
got married, and our female relations are all very
comfortably off.” Then the foiled attorney sank
into his chair, vanquished and undone.
There is another married Sydney man who
says he never gambles now. His sudden conver-
sion was wrought by a domestic disaster. Once
he stayed “spieling” at a club until the small hours,
and rose from the table the winner of a few hun-
dreds, his pockets literally stuffed with notes and
cash. When he awoke, late next day, his first
act was to overhaul his garments. The pockets
were turned inside out —not a cent in the
whole rig-out! To his wife : “ Where’s the cash I
brought home ?” “My dear, when I saw so much
money upon you, I guessed that you had been
gambling. I felt that such ill-gotten gains could
bring no possible blessing upon you ; in fact, that
they must provoke a curse. So I turned the
pockets inside-out and shook the clothes out of
the window, for I wouldn’t have the money in the
place.”
Which beautiful fairy-tale recalls the defaulting
secretary, who thus airily accounted for a weak-
ness of J 3300 in the spinal column of the ledger :
“It must have blown away. I had the money in
notes, and I brought them home for safe keeping.
I put them on the table near the window for a
minute, and a gust of wind suddenly blew ’em
right away.”

Since I pasted Mister Crick—

But my temper now is quick,

I’m the legislative bruiser of the South.
Take that! you blanky blanker !
Would you like another spanker
From the legislative bruiser of the South ?
When the crimson flood is flowing
I’m as jolly as a king,
For the appetite is growing very fast.
Seeds of discord ever sowing,
All the season through I sing—
“ Will anyone oblige me with ten minutes in a
ring ?
I’ll change him to a vision of the past!’’
With my batter —batter—batter,
I would leave the beggar flatter
Than a pancake in a frying-pan at last.
True, I wasn't born pugnacious,
If the stories nursey told
Were anyway veracious at the time;
I didn’t feel audacious,
Or particularly bold.
Till, painting Crick a harmony in browny-blue and
gold,
I got a taste of ecstasy sublime.
That set my courage boiling ;
For another fight I’m spoiling—
-0 ! manslaughter is an honourable crime.
So, then, wave my gory banner
On the Mudgee mountain height
In a most aggressive manner to the breeze ;
I’m the local Doctor Tanner
Who can bark as well as bite—
If you like a bit of “scrapping,” better come to-
morrow night :
You can put your money on me, if you please.
Gosh ! I’ll jump upon the loser,
For I’m Mudgee Haynes, the bruiser—
I’m the bloke that braves the battle and the
breeze.
The Case for the Single-
Tax.
BY JOHN FARRELL.
No. I.—Tim Possible Ideal.
In The Bulletin of September 23 there appeared
an article on “ Land-tax versus Single-tax,” in
which certain statements regarding the Single-tax
party and the courses they advocate are made.
Summarised, these are to the effect that to deriv e
the whole expense of government from land-values
would be unjust to some classes; that a man who
invests his money in land should not have the
value of the land confiscated, “which is the same
thing as confiscating the land itself ;” that Single-
taxcis contemplate the free admission of Hindoos,
whisky, Chinese, and so on; that there is no par-
ticular advantage about having only one tax, and
that, under the Single-tax, no new industries
would be created or manufactures built up. The
Bulletin has generously accorded me space in
which to reply, and I will endeavour, in three
letters, to state the case for the Single-tax in its
main outlines. The first of these will be devoted
to showing the conditions of life that would
logically follow equal freedom of all to apply their
labour to production; the second, to explaining
the reasons why, under existing laws, life becomes
harder for most, and must Continue to do so ; and
the third, to showing the efficacy of the remedy
proposed, and its justice.' I will do this in the
simplest possible words, avoiding, wherever prac-
ticable, the use of statistics and politico-economi-
cal terminology.
The basis of the Single-tax contention is that
every human being has an equal right with all
others to exercise whatever powers of mind or
body he may possess in the satisfaction of his
needs or desires. This implies equal access with
all others to the raw material, without which his
labour cannot operate. It also involves the right
of ownership by himself of the whole product of
his labour, subject to no deduction by the State
or by single individuals. The only just title to
the ownership of anything, Single-taxers hold, is
that of having earned it, and this title must be as
inviolable by the community as by any of its com-
ponent units. The just wage of the labourer,
whether with mind or hand, is all that he pro-
duces. Under the Single-tax, this wage would be
secured to him.
In the monopoly of natural opportunities of
production by some individuals to the exclusion
of others, those who have intelligently followed
Henry George's exhaustive inquiry see distinctly
the sole and sufficient reason why life becomes
harder for the majority, instead of easier, with
WEIGHED DOWN: TOO MUCH “EARMARKING.”
the growth of population and the progress of
knowledge. In the abolition of this monopoly
they see the remedy, and the method whereby
they would compass this is not by placing a tax
upon any class, but by absolutely removing taxa-
tion from every class.
I will instance an imaginary community where
practical equality of opportunity prevails to show
what the result upon social conditions would be ;
for there is unfortunately no actual illustration to
be found in the world.' It will not be peopled
with ideally self-denying individuals who find
their reward in the consciousness of doing good
and conferring benefit or pleasure on others. They
will be people having ordinary or extraordinary
differences of strength, intelligence, and taste,
and possessed of the perfectly natural desire of
satisfying all their wants in the easiest way,
which is commonly called selfishness and mis-
takenly regarded as a failing of human nature.
In such a community the value of every oppor-
tunity to produce, of agricultural, grazing,
mineral, town or other lands, would be decided
by public appraisement, and paid in the form of
annual rental, or of royalties, into a fund for
general use. The way of determining this rental
could be either by periodical assessment, or by
competition for the purchase of leaseholds, subject
to absolute ownership by every lessee of all im-
provement values created by him. This is merely
a question of administration. Rrivate landlords
have no difficulty in getting the full rental value
of their lands, neither would the public landlord.
As Herbert Spencer puts it, “The change re-
quired (from the present system) would be simply
a change of landlords. Separate ownerships would
merge into the joint-stock ownership of the public.
Instead of being in the possession of individuals,
the country would be held by the great corporate
body, Society. Instead of leasing his acres from
an isolated proprietor, the farmer would lease
them from the nation. Instead of paying his
rent to the agent of Sir John or His Grace, he
would pay it to an agent or deputy-agent of the
community. Stewards would be public officials
instead of private ones ; and tenancy the only
land-tenure. ’
Here, then, would be the revenue for govern-
mental purposes provided without taxation of any
kind—the fund which tenants of private landlords
have to pay in addition to taxation of every kind,
for which they receive practically no return, as I
will show hereafter. In the community I have
supposed, no man would have an advantage over
another, save such as rested in his own capacity
to produce or aid production, or to render service.
The man with special strength or ability could not
prevent the man without these from having his
fair chance at the material-heap. All he could do
would be to produce more —more of something for
himself, by producing more of something which the
others wanted and would consent to exchange
their own products with him for. The more of
anything anybody produced, the greater would be
the supply and the smaller the relative demand.
Consequently, the smaller would be the share of
his labour-product which another would give in
exchange for that thing. Adam Smith, writing
of the time precedent to land monopolisation and
its attendant evils, put the matter quite clearly,
“Had this state continued the wages of labour
would have augmented with all these improve-
ments in its productive powers to which the divi-
sion of labour gives rise. All things would have
gradually become cheaper. They would have been
produced by a smaller quantity of labour, and as
the commodities produced by equal quantities of
labour would in this state of things be exchanged
for one another, they would have been purchased
likewise with the produce of a smaller quantity
No one with marvellous strmgth or talent, no
one with a monopoly of inventiveness, or any other
gift of mind or body, could thereby secure a power
of enslavement over any of his fellows. He could
only use his gift for his enrichment and theirs in
a way they approved and paid him for. No such
one can do otherwise now. Bessemer, Tennyson,
Siemens, Gilbert, Edison, or anyone else who
prospers greatly because of remarkable powers,
cannot extort payment. They are paid for service
which the buyers count as more than equivalent
to what is paid. They are servants of society
which it is under no obligation to employ, and
would not employ save for its own gain. But
there is now a method of using the wages they
receive, which gives them power to take the earn-
ings of others without return.
There are two ways only by which men can
compel others to thus work for them without
return ; by owning their bodies, as under chattel
slavery, or by owning the natural media without
which they cannot live, and selling the oppor-
tunity to produce to the highest bidders, as under
land monopoly. Those who, under the various
proposals of Socialism, would have the State
direct all application of labour and apportion the
product according to desert or to need, think that
great aggregations of capital—as, for instance,
machinery—would enable the possessors to secure
a lien on the services of those having only their
hands or the commonest- tools to work with.
There is no ground for that fear. In a community
where all were equally free to work at anything,
the strongest might produce, say, fifty times as
much as the weakest. In doing so he would not
limit the power of the weakest to produce. He
ivould increase that power by increasing and cheapen-
ing the available quantity of some commodity or
service in which the weakest would share by exchange.
Carry this principle to the utmost limit con-
ceivable and it remains the same. Immense
applications of capital could only result in im-
mense and equitably diffused good. The man
who uses a spade or axe in a primitive state of
civilisation can do more productive work than one
who uses neither, but he cannot injure that one.
Even if that greatest of all productive develop-
ments, exchange, had not come into existence, and
each individual directly produced things solely for
his own use, he could injure no one who had an equal
access to material with himself, by producing
more. But, in producing by exchange, the more
he can do the better for the whole circle of ex-
changing consumers. With monopoly of raw
material abolished, the man who replaced axe or
spade with more effective machinery would be, in
the full degree of the productive difference, a
public benefactor. The wealth he would obtain
for himself would represent public appraisement
of what he had added to the public treasure-heap
in some definite form desired by tlie community.
It would be a certificate of authorisation to him to
take from that heap in return definite things
desired by himself and produced by others.
In other words, the nationalisation of land
would mean the nationalisation of all means of
production and exchange. No one could obtain
wealth, save in return for service to the com-
munity. No one could use tools, machinery, or
his own gifts of discovering, directing, or com-
bining save as a public servant. What ownership
of the means of production and exchange by the
community could be more complete - what control
so simple and effective? Every development of
invention would enable all consumers of certain
commodities to satisfy their requirements with a
less amount of labour than formerly would
raise their wages, since wages are the necessaries
or enjoyments resulting from labour. Great fac-
tories, intricate machines, remarkable individual
ability of mind or body, would be powers working
for the general good. The workers displaced by
eaeli inventive development, would have infinite
opportunities of employment open to them as
freely as to the machine-owner and capitalist of
whatever degree, and would become sharers in the
advantage of cheapened product resulting from
the machines which displaced them. The only
ground on which men would accept employment
from others would bo that those others would pay
them a higher wage than they could earn on their
own account.
Of course, men who have been specially fitted
by training for one occupation could not produce
nearly as good a return for their labour in another.
Thus a weaver, displaced, would not make an
equally capable agriculturist, or bootmaker, and
so with all other trades. But, in addition to his
share of the cheapening of cloth caused bit his oivn
displacement, he ivould profit by the cheapening of
every other labour-product resulting from labour-
saving machinery. And this too, which is a very
important matter, must be considered. As know-
ledge and invention progress the need for special
training becomes rapidly less. Once a man spent
six or seven years of his life learning to
do what a boy can now learn to do ten times mors
effectively in a few hours by tending a machine.
The natural tendency of progress is thus to make
production easier, and to make men master a
dozen branches of productive occupation in the
time formerly required to master one. This, like
every other real blessing of productive progress, is
made to seem a curse under present conditions.
Life would become easier for all. The natural
effect of competitive effort, namely, to render
supply or service better and cheaper, would make
it so. The increase of population, by drawing co-
operation closer and saving waste, would make it
so. Every new worker appearing would make it
so, because, where there are ten, each can produce
more than where there are five. Atthesame time,
the rent-fund, the proper source of public
revenue, would grow automatically with the
community. Nobody would pay any tax, rent
being payment for special privilege or opportunity
enjoyed by some over others. Each would receive
all he produced, and each would share equally
with others in governmental advantages. Pro-
vision, to which they would be entitled as a right,
not as a benevolence, could be made out of this
fund for those unable to work.
I (wish to avoid what may seem exaggeration.
But the conclusion forced upon one who examines
the facts is that, if the equitable right of property
was enforced, individual earnings would steadily
grow, side by side with the communal rent-fund for
public use, in which all individuals would equally
share. That is the possible ideal : a state of
things under which every mechanical invention,
every increase of population, every act of com-
petition, would make life easier, more refined,
more enjoyable for all, and in which that terrible
thought of to-morrow, which makes to-day a hell
for so many, would not arise. That is the
natural result of widening intelligence which
continually seeks and finds easier methods of
shaping nature’s raw material into forms of use-
fulness. There is nothing wild in the supposition
that if justice between man and man prevailed
there would be no poverty among the world’s
civilisations to-day. It is absurd to think other-
wise. The earth with all its potentialities of
wealth-yielding is still with us : the power of man
to produce this wealth has increased—how many
times? Who can conjecture? Yet life becomes
painful and devilish in its want and perpetual
apprehension. In the densely-peopled countries,
where prosperity should be highest, millions of
men and women are in a worse condition than
dogs or swine through deprivation. In my next
letter I propose to show that this shocking tact is
the inevitable result of land monopoly, and
exhibit from the present state of this province how
it works.
Dear Bulletin. —Be your paragraph
about Nesbit being made a Q.C.* and the sugges-
tion implied therein that the S. A. Judges were
opposed to the appointment. They were not a >
opposed. Some years ago the Chief Justice nomi-
nated an Adelaide lawyer for silk. For some
reason the Govt.—Flay ford’s it was —refused to
back the nomination. This so disgusted the chief
—who has to stand on his dignity ; he is person-
ally small —-that he would not make any further
nomination, but all along he recognised, the fact
that Nesbit’s standing in the profession was such
as to more than warrant the Q.C. honour. All
the members of the Bench, and all the lawyers in
Adelaide —including the gentleman referred to
above—approve of the appointment. I have good
reason for believing that if Nesbit bad applied for
silk when this other gentlemen applied he would
have been a Q.C. some years ago.—Yours, J.C.W.

Frauds.—The spirit of misrepresentation per
vades all classes of society, and so, amid the
monotonous daily round of public exposure of
trickery and quackery it is indeed refreshing to
the mind to find an oasis, where the element of
deceit has not penetrated. The public have long
been acquainted with the sterling therapeutic
properties of that widely - known preparation
“Marshall’s Tonic Nervine,” having proved its
many excellences, but when the additional
evidence of a gentleman so widely-known as John
Palmer, Esq., Head Bailiff of the Central Police
Court, is tendered, his opinion is worth recording.
He writes: —“By chance, a few weeks ago,
one of MARSHALL’S TONIC NERVINE
treatises was placed in my hands for
perusal, by a friend who knew I had been
for some considerable time a martyr to
INDIGESTION and DEBILITY. After read-
ing its contents and noting the various tributes to
its efficacy, I resolved to give it a trial, and I now
feel most happy to state that, after a course of six
bottles, I am thoroughly cured of my distressing
ailments. My HEALTH IS Al, my appetite
good, my strength has come back, and I enjoy
sound sleep at night, instead ot the restless, dis-
ordered slumber that previously Was my lot. I
write this for the guidance and benefit of sufferers
from my old complaints, and think it my duty to
publicly acknowledge the great good that
MARSHALL’S TONIC NERVINE has done
for me.

Chinese fishermen on the Endeavour River
(Q.) anchored small tin cylinders outside their
Malayan rivals’ fish-traps. In the cylinders were
sponges saturated with some vilely-smelling acid,
which, oozing through perforations in the tin,
poisoned the water and drove the fish away up
the river towards the Chinamen’s traps. The
Cooktown P.M. said the law could give no redress.
JACK KNOWLES’ FORTY FRIENDS.
A friend in need is a friend indeed, says the
old saw. Quite so. Fair weather friends are
plentiful enough, goodness knows ; the kind that
drop in on you, talk to you, bother you, and
borrow things from you; the kind that never
bring hack that five shillings, but ask for five more
“just to make it ten,” that breed of friends, I
say, are as thick as flies over a sugar-bowl. But
the sort who stick by you when you are down on
your luck, who put their shoulders against j our
cart wheels at a nasty spot in the road —why, you
want to hunt for them with spectacles and a
lantern. Yet, after all, such friends do exist, and
forty of them turned up, without any hunting,
when Mr. Knowles needed them badly. How it
happened he tells us in the following statement.
I, Jonathan Knowles, of Lotton Fen, near
Ramsey, Hunts, do solemnly and sincerely declare
as follows : —I was always a strong healthy man
up to April, 1889, when I began to feel ill. At
first I felt dull, low-spirited and had no energy.
I had a poor appetite and for days and days
could eat nothing. What I did eat laid like lead
on my chest. I had a gnawing, sinking feeling
at the pit of the stomach, and was constantly
sick, vomiting up a green fluid. At times the
heaving and straining was so great that blood
came up. My hands and feet were always cold,
an 1 clammy sweats used to break out all over me.
I never felt warm even when I sat before the fire.
Next a hacking dry cough, with severe pains at
my chest and lungs, began to trouble me, and my
breathing became short and hurried, I soon got
so weak that I had to give up my work, for I
could only walk a few yards without stopping to
take my breath. The cough and shortness of
breath got gradually worse and worse, and I
began to lose flesh rapidly. At first a doctor
from Ramsey came to see me, he gave me
medicines and cod liver oil, but held out no hope
of my getting better, and after attending me
three months he recommended me to go to the
hospital. I got a recommendation from my
master, Mr. David Corney, Wellington House,
St. Mary’s, and went to the Peterborough In-
firmary. I had to be taken in a trap to the
railway station, such was my weak state. The
doctors at the Infirmary had me stripped and
sounded my lungs, and said one of my lungs was
almost gone, and that I was in a consumption.
They gave me medicines, also cod liver oil, but
nothing did me any good. After being under
their care and treatment for three months I was
discharged as incurable. My wife and relations
now lost all hope of my ever getting well again,
and everyone who saw me looked upon me as
being in a decline. My cheeks had sunk and I
had wasted away until I was only a shadow of
my former self, you could even see the sinews
through my flesh. I was nothing but skin and
bone, having lost three stone in weight. I got up
every day but had to sit in an arm-chair all day
long. I could only move a few yards and that
with the aid of a stick. In this half-dead, half-
alive state I continued for nearly two years, and
was looked upon as doomed. During the latter
part my wife did not think I should live from one
week to another, and friends who came to see me
used to say, “ Poor Jack will never come out
alive again.” In December, 1890, when I was at
my worst, a neighbour of mine, Mrs. King, True
Briton Inn, told me of a medicine called Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup and gave me half a bottle
of it. I had no faith in anything doing me any
good but I took it. Having been so long out of
work I could not get money for more of the Syrup.
So strongly were my friends convinced that the
medicine would do me good that a subscription
was started and over 40 people subscribed to enable
mo to get a further supply. Mrs. King got the
Syrup from Mr. J. Freeman, Chemist, Ramsey,
and kept me supplied with it. After I had taken
three bottles of the Syrup I felt benefit. I kept
on with the medicine and gradually got stronger
and stronger, and got back to my work. Of
course it took a long time before I properly got
up my strength. I can now do any kind of work,
and feel so strong that I often walk 14 miles a
day, for which I thank God and Mother Seigel’s
Syrup. Everyone in the district is astonished at
my recovery. I tell them all that Seigel’s Syrup
has brought me back to life. I wish others to
know of what has done so much for me, and I
give permission to the Proprietors of the medicine
to make what use they think fit of this state-
ment ; and I make this solemn declaration con-
jcientiously believing the same to be true. By
virtue of the Statutory Declaration Act, 1835
(Will. IV., c. 62).

You take notice, of course, that Mr. Knowles
makes a solemn legal declaration to the truth of
his remarkable story. It is so full of suggestive
facta that I could write a book about it. But
there is no time nor room now to do that. The
points to remember are these :—lf the doctors
thought “ Poor Jack ” had consumption they were
mistaken. The fact that he got well shows he
had no consumption. A man who can now walk
14 miles a day has got two good lungs. Doctors
have no business to make such blunders and scare
patients out of all courage and hope. But there !
Ignorance is ignorance, no matter where you run
serosa it. What ailed Mr. Knowles was in-
digestion and dyspepsia—nothing else. The
sough and loss of flesh were symptoms of that,
not of the destruction of lung substance. Next,
keep bearing in mind that all our common
maladies signify that our machinery for digesting
food is out of order. It is so when it doesn’t look
■o, the same as when it does.
That is the secret of the success of Mother
Seigel’s Syrup. It cleanses the cistern and the
pipes, and then the water of life runs clear and
sweet. Those 40 sensible friends believed in that.
Mr. J. Knowles is a very respectable hard-
working man. He is a farm labourer and has a
small allotment of land which he cultivates. The
persons who subscribed to get him the Syrup are
principally farm labourers and farmers residing in
the district of Ramsey. The case is well known
to all the people round about where Knowles
lives. Mrs. Knowles, in speaking of her husband’s
long illness, stated that she never for one moment
expected his recovery. She could see him gradu-
ally dwindling away, and herself and children
could not take their meals for tears when they
saw the dreadful condition Mr. Knowles was in,
for they expected losing him every week.

“Gala’s" consultation for the Caulfield
Cup was drawn last week, and closed with 17,800
subscribers out of a 20,000 sweep, which must
have been highly satisfactory to Mr. Alexander,
the promoter. His Melbourne Cup is 50,000, at
5 each, and 20,000 at 10 each, and at the rate sub-
scribers are sending for tickets, should about close
with the full complement, in spite of the draw-
backs with the new Postal Amendment Act. As
this soon closes, subscribers had better hurry in

“ What an utter farce is our service,” re-
marks a London writer. “ What a spavined,
narrow-chested, squint-eyed lot are they 1 And
no wonder, when the privates are generally the
rabble of our gutter civilisation —it is generally
considered a disgrace to join the colours. No
private soldier dare enter a restaurant, a club, a
theatre or music-hall (except pit or gallery), and
as to any pride in the profession, such an idea has
long ago vanished. The difference between officer
and private is simply the difference between chalk
and cheese. Whilst —look across at France —the
army consists of the very best blood in the land,
and it is _ an honour to be seen talking to a non-
commissioned officer or private. Often and often
have I seen the latter dining or breakfasting at
the Cafes Vefours, or Voisins, or Anglais, or any
of the very best. The French Government under-
stands its army, its vanity, and its wants. Here
we have the useless Duke of Cambridge, and now
the equally useless Duke of Connaught. But
what matters it as long as Royalty gets the
pickings?”
Dear Bulletin, —The Australasian Medi-
cal Gazette is wrong re the Pert (Miller’s Point
murder) case. The post-mortems at the London
hospitals in the winter months are nearly always
done by artificial light; so are the dissections—
and some of the best pathological work of the
world is done in London. Moreover, it is quite
certain that in the Pert case one side or other
was well, wrong, and to an outsider un-
touched by Sydney cliqueism and who has a
special knowledge of pathology—the balance of
evidence appeared to be in favour of Dr. Milford
being right. But it was the same dull, old comedy
over again. We saw it well played at the last
Medical Congress before a large audience of Aus-
tralian medicoes. Then the Anderson-Stuartites
took the principal parts, and the Tarrantites
hissed from the pit. In the Pert case the
Tarrantites came to the front and, for the good
of humanity, it was just as well that the jury did
not absolutely swallow the story about that
vertebral artery. It will be interesting, when the
N.S.W. Medical Bill passes, to watch the two
gangs fighting for supremacy in the Council.—

The opening of the new wool warehouse of
M'Burney, Wallis and Co., in Napier-street,
Sydney, last week, was regarded as quite a com-
mercial event. Among the representative men
present were—W. Carson and C. H. Wallis
(Winchcombe, Carson and Co.), J. Rowe (Dal-
gety and Co ), A, Hope (Harrison, Jones and
Devlin), John Vicars (Johnson and Vicars),
Leonard Dodds, N. Thomson (Thomson Bros.),
and a score of others, besides whom numerous
smaller commercial lights attended. Octogenarian
Parkes was honoured with the call of ceremo-
niously declaring the stores open, and historically
traversed the rise and progress of the N.S.W.
wool-trade, from the primal days of the land’s
colonisation when its total number of sheep
were 29, and the horned cattle amounted to six
head, right up to date with its Ooghlan-sorted
statistics of millions. Parkes disputes with
M’Burney that it was not Mort who organised
the first wool-sale in N.S. Wales, but bets on his
memory that Mort’s partner, Brown, both organ-
ised and conducted it. M‘Burney, Wallis and
Co.’s new stores embrace three floors. 0n the
upper-deck, so to speak, the bales are opened and
tested prior to purchase. Every attention has
been paid to requirements for lighting, storage,
ventilation and convenience of handling, and the
vigorous young firm of M'Burney, Wallis and Co.
has before it business prospects of which it has
every reason to be proud.
Dear Bulletin,—Re the mirage : I fancy
your correspondent, “D.,” mistakes the smoky-
looking film often seen on Australian plains for
the mirage proper. As to the latter: when
bullock-driving in Riverina, I have very often mis-
taken the mirage for water, and vice versa. A
young man—who, as a boy, had accompanied me
in several trips—on reading “D.’s” par. recalled
to my mind an occasion on which he had in per-
fect good faith taken a billy toward a mirage for
water, while the waggons stopped for lunch, and
a fire was kindled to make tea on his return. In
fact, in any locality where physical and atmos-
pheric conditions are favourable to the production
of the mirage, nothing but a perfect knowledge of
the country, and the certainty that there is no
water there, could convince the spectator of the
delusion. “ D.’s ” knowledge of the mirage pro-
per is given away by the nature of his comment
on some lying yarn about thirsty cattle or horses
making for a mirage. One of the most remarkable
facts connected with this singular phenomenon,
and most familiar to anyone well acquainted
with it, is that horses and cattle are insusceptible
to the hallucination, and never notice the mirage
in any way. But I well remember commenting
with some other fellows on this point once, when
a few loose bullocks left our teams and walked
briskly across the plain, some two or three hun-
dred yards, to enjoy a satisfying drink at what
we had taken for granted to be a mirage, but
which was in reality the residuum of a local recent
thunderstorm. This was on the One-Tree Plain
the very homo of the mirage. Some correspon-
dent from that locality, or from any part of the
Murrumbidgee-Darling plains country, should be
able to set the question at rest. —Tom Collins.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
When is the double, Metropolitan and Melb-
Cup, or Caulfield Cup, coming off?
• « •
The Caulfield grievance is deadheadery. About
a thousand people had a gratis view of the races over the
fence, Cup day. The local shire council, apparently with
this object, insisted on a lowering of the fence.
# # «
The Bulletin said of the Caulfield Cup—
“ history shows that all sorts of animals can win it.” Tim
Swiveller, a hurdle-racer and highly eccentric performer,
won the race this year. Any young man troubled with an
incipient craving for “the turf” is advised to buy a
calt-ndir and study the recent “form” of the Hon.
G orge Davis’s horse, after which he may read how
t.e Hon. George was “ very confident" about Tim
Swiveller, and how his friends all backed it, and by that
time the incipient craver will probably perceive the error
of judging horses by what they did a week or two before
a big race. But this advice will apply equally to the
horses of many people who are notex-Ministers of Defence.
# # #
The Davis stable also furnished the last horse
for the Caulfield Cup in Fortunatus, who looked bright
and beautiful in the paddock. On the principle that it is
the unexpected which usually happens with Fortunatus,
ai well as Tim Swiveller, one ought to predict a brilliant
victory for the Newmarket winner next week. He was
k locked out of the betting for the Caulfled race, and that
is a great point to remember. Eight days before Tim
Swiveller did the big trick, he (Tim) was beaten off in a
paltry handicap, won by Moscow. From the records of
this race it seems that the Hon. Davies’ horse
started at “10 to 1 ” (at first 4 to 1) in a field of seven. He
was knocked out in the betting, badly licked over the
m le and three furlongs, and yet his owner fancied him
for the Cup.
* • *
Bump or no bump, Swiveller was fairly the
fastest goer at the finish. He came with one run at the
critical moment, whereas Moscow, with an impatient boy
on his back, ran as though the race had to be won at the
last turn. Probably Chris. Moore on Moscow could have
got home a lot more easily than C. M. on Swiveller, for
the little grey horse was always well forward and didn’t
requ re to be rush;d at one fell swoop a couple of lengths
in front of the field. Coming down the straight it looked
for an instant as though Moscow would “walk in,” but
he was busted by his premature effort and finished nearly
two lengths behind the winning horse. Of those behind
him only Newman and Jeweller cut any particular dash
during the race. All the handsome cattle from South
Au rralia ran badly, and Brockleigh’s appearance after
the race indicated that he was a non stayer, or very much
“off* for the moment. After the Caulfield Stakes on
Wednesday the Newcastle horse had scarcely turned a
hair, but now he was sweating from head to heels and
thoroughly distressed.
# # •
Caulfield Guineas did not, in the opinion of a
good many people, disclose the likeliest winners of the
V.R.C. Derby. Sailor Prince should prove the best of the
Guineas lot by the time he gets to Flemington, but if
there be any really good three-year-olds about they will
surely shake their tails at such as Patron and Sailor
Prince.
• • *
The victory of Titan in the Toorak Handicap
was the pleasantest feature of the V.A.T.C., next to a
striking general improvement in the grassy surroundings.
A good, hearty cheer went up for horse and owner when
Titan (who won because, being a gelding, he wasn’t
trained too thin) weighed in. On Saturday they cheered
again for, although beaten by Warpaint, he had an honest
“go" with 9st. lOlbs. on his back.
« • •
Just before the start for Caulfield Cup, Ettridge,
on S .infoin, satirically called out to Moore, on Tim Swivel-
ler, “Where do you expect to finish, Chris?" “Justin
front of you, wherever you are," came the quick response.
And so it came to pass.

unbroken colts lent to the co. by squatters for breaking-
in—the weight on his arm can be imagined. The month’s
work, 2400 miles, the writer believes, establishes a record.

Dear Bulletin,—Your correspondent who
pleads for the chess prowess of Crane and Wallace, gives,
by his apologetic tone, an unintended emphasis to my
contention that this alleged “championship ” contest has
been a sorry affair. The games have been “ sound,” says
he; mediocrity is always “sound.” “Crane’s great
strength is his sitting power in heaven’s name, then,
provide him with a clutch of eggs and let him “sit.”
“ Morphy’s brilliancies, with a few exceptions, were im-
promptu games, and Anderson’s celebrated K.B. game
was also impromptu.” In the name of all that is test-
worthy, what should any live chess-game be but “ im-
promptu ” ? If two men sit down to play, how can the
second player foretell his own move until he sees his
opponent’s previous move? And if two men are only to
sit down and air their “thorough knowledge of the
openings and books,” by trotting out text-moves and
text-replies, just to show that they are “sound,” in what
sense is this championship chess? It bears the same
relation to cheas-playiny as consulting a “ ready-
reckoner” does to working out a problem in high
m ithematios. Mechanical automata might be con-
trived to perform it. Wallace certainly has shown more
or.ginality than Crane, but-no matter! I know at
least half-a-dozen players in Australia who must have got
impatient with everything near them, if they worried
through these “ champion ” games. How is a “ cham-
pionship” regulated in Australia? Must a player per-
force belong to a club ? Or is it open to all ? In short, is
it merely a club championship or a claim to a national
championship? It is the latter claim only that can
move chessplayers to feel regret about these indifferent
games.—Yours, &c., C.

Caulfield rapidly advances in prestige. The

The simple issue of last season is that Caulfield pays,

It is a lighter, clearer, anti more ethereal oil than any

This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayedi
into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken Internally, which places:
it above other preparations, and considerably enhances its.

The Howard Steel-frame Binder.
The Howard solid steel-frame chain-drive binder,
of which we give an illustration, has captivated
the practical fancy of Australian farmers, and is
the invention of J. and C. Howard. The first
Howard binder was tried in Australia in ’Bl, and
its extensive use and popularity still are proofs
that it has come to stay. Young J. G. Howard
arrived in Australia in ’B4, carrying his bluey and
tool-bag through four harvests, beginning in South
Australia and ending in Maoriland. His varied
personal experiences of the tricks of binders bore
practical fruit in the solid steel-frame hinder
which he and his younger brother, Char ie—not
unknown on N.S.W. show-grounds—perfected in
’BB. Practical agriculture has been a atnily
characteristic of these Howards, whose uncles and
grandfather won “the bubble reputation” in
many a plougbing-match and harvesting com-
p tition. J. and C. Howard brought their hinder
t> the front by a careful study of Australian
conditions, and the application of their machine
to those conditions. The binder is built with a
solid steel-frame, and is equally serviceable in
all sorts of rough usage, whether bouncing over
water-gutters, or colliding with stumps; it is
easily placed tin transports when a field has been
cutout; the driver can readily shift the fanners
and table to suit any sizi or density of the crop.
It matters not to the Howard whether the crop is
shelling with ripeness or dead-green for hay;
whether it is down or standing. The frequent
testimony of many a user is l —“l worked all day
yesterday and never saw a missed sheaf ; she’s a
fair daisy.” It saves labour ; the cookies’ women
all like it because it saves them a lot of cooking ;
any station-hand can drive it. It will pay any
squatter, who has only a few acres of hay, to in-
vest in a Howard Binder. It places small strain
on horses, as the big main-wheel makes the
draught very light. The bearings are provided with
lubricators capable of holding oil sufficient to
last half-a day, which dispenses with the trouble,
annoyance and risk attendant on oiling a machine
to which horses are attached and from which they
might be liable to suddenly breakaway. Once, in
the early days of the binder, .1. C. Howard received
a wire that a farmer's machine had gone wrong.
He took train and horse to the paddock and found
the farmer driving like Jehu with never a sheaf
tied. “ Why,” said J. C., “you’ve got no twine
in the box.’’ “Does the blanky machine want
any twine to make it tie?” But the farmers
know better now, and it is a common thing for
the Benjamin of the family to go out in the morn-
ing alone with the hinder, and only see the girl
who brings him his dinner, until he returns at
night, having 15 acres cut. J. and C. Howard,
whose business address is 2SO£ Pitt-street, Sydney,
are always ready to explain details to those com-
municating with them either personally or by
letter. All callers receive a warm Australian
welcome. „

Lloyd M‘Ointy, of Budarra (N.S.W.),
went a-fishing in the Macintyre, and laid his coat,
meanwhile, on the bank. After driving home in
the evening, he felt something alive in the lining
of his coat and managed to despatch—we now
quote a country paper—“ a black snake about 21ft.
long therein, the reptile evidently having crawled
through a small hole in the breast pocket.” Which
only shows one of the awful things that may
happen to a man named Lloyd M'Ginty.
In a recent law-case at Maitland (N.S.W.)
Circuit Court, some very old local fogies con-
gregated. One lot of five old men were dis-
cussing events of 60 years ago. One was William
Wright, resident in the district since 1825.
Another, Henry Harris, was born in Parramatta
85 years ago, and had resided on the Hunter since
1826. A third, Isaac Newton, is 83. Another
was so old that he had forgotten his age, but was
sure he had passed the century, lie had been in
N.S.W. since 1810, and lived at Hexham for 70
y ars. This was “old” .Jack Dower, whom
Wright says was a middle-aged man in 1825, when
he first met him. With one exception, all five
have been hard drinkers, and the exception has
never been by any means a teetotaller. Four
have smoked since boyhood, and one said he had
swallowed enough rum in his day to float a three-
decker.

President MacMahon’s masterpiece was to
have been Monarchic restoration, in alliance with
his fellow-conspirators, Broglie and Fourtou ; but
bravo Gambetta foiled them, for which he under-
went imprisonment. The coup-d'ctat was all
arranged—they even had the new State coaches
ready, when the Comte deChambord, as monarch,
providentially raised his objection to the tricolour
and insisted on the white flag, which gave the
other side breathing-time.

CLIMATIC CHANGES.
The sadden changes of temperature, so charac-
teristic of the season, are the cause of more in-
dividual arid domestic trouble than is generally
supposed. Most of the evils which result from
these changes originate in the little-thought-of
“chill” with which we are all so familiar. The
only really effective remedy, and one which should
be kept at all times, and under all conditions,
handy for all members of the household, is the
standard favorite, St. Jacobs Oil. It can be
bought from any chemist or druggist, and carries
with it a sense of security to the possessor shared
by no other remedy. It is
JUST WHAT IS WANTED,
for, whenever any article has stood the crucial
test of public use and opinion for any lengthened
period of time, and the public demand for such is
continuously sustained, you may be sure that it
fills a public need. When, in the case of that
article being a proprietary medicine, the demand
is not only steadily sustained but continually
increasing, you may be absolutely certain that
there is some extraordinary merit in it, and in the
case of St. Jacobs Oil this is borne out by the
testimony of the press and of thousands of
reputable citizens in all parts of the civilised
world. Apropos, Messrs. Francis, Newbery, &
Sons, London, one of the oldest drug houses in
Great Britain (established nearly a century and a
half), write—“We have sold St. Jacobs Oil for
years; demand continually increasing on its
extraordinary merits.”
THE DAY HAS PAST for “ poking'borak ”
at the faithful, old long-winding series of
the WATERBURY Watch. Old-time Con-
servatism has gracefully acknowledged its past
errors, and now admits the WA ♦ ERBURY to be
undoubtedly the VERY BEST LOW-COST
TIMEKEIiIBER ever offered to the public. The
ink of good-natured satire, as applied to the
Waterbary, has run dry, but the pen of interested
malice will run till the crack of doom. The new
short-winding WATERBURY WATCHES are
perfect models of horological skill; while the old
series Waterbary— paper dial and two minutes to
wind to boot —is a more reliable timekeeper than
any of its would-be rivals, in spite of the visibly-
hard - polished - nickel - plated - extra - polished-
cylinder intestines with which some of them may
or may not be fitted to special order.

possible.” We know “it moves” when the

glory so long. Secrecy was a fine thing so long as
it served as a cloak for the Argus’ little gods.

My Dear Moorabinda—
The typically Australian scrub over against
Randwick, where the new rifle-range lies, was
V.R. for the first time the other Tuesday, when
Sir Robert and Lady Duff journeyed out (His
Ex., who is a very moderate equestrian, mounted
on a steady bay horse) to see the straight riding
Tenterfieldians rush away with the Hutton
Shield—a large, embossed silver plate (manufac-
tured by Messrs. Fairfax and Roberts) mounted
on ruby velvet, balanced on the flower-covered
gun carriage (which conveyed the prizes corpse-
wise into Barracks) beside the Silver Cup pre-
sented by Governor Duff.
Only a mere wisp of society followed the vice-
regalities into the sandy places of the suburbs,
although the “wantage race” was as good as a
circus. Teams of a score or so of men galloped
through the bush, rising simultaneously over the
jumps, stopping and dismounting to fire, and then
racing home at full speed—a most exciting spec-
tacle. The Tenterfield gang scored a rattling win
(the Tenterfieldians, I am told, are a community
of hurdle-flyers), and the only drawback was that
the warrior who whipped ’em galloped past the
judges with a large bough of dead bush tangled in
his gee-gee’s culminating swish. It was the peace-
ful Australian Version of Troilus’s treatment of
the Trojan—“ Here! tie his body to my horse's
tail.”
Lady Duff —who gave the prizes—wore the very
oddest hat I believe I have ever seen. It was
shaped like the headgear of the knave of clubs—
the high, wide crown sloping out to the top,
apparently made of plaster of Paris, and finished
off in an architectural manner with mouldings at
the several corners. A faint trimming of black
feathers spoilt it as a work of art—an imitation
iron railing round the edge, and a draped urn
done in petto, would have been ever so much more
in keeping with the bricks-and-mortar tone of the
structure. Mrs. Hutton, in a black gown and a
crinoline-straw hat, trimmed with feathers and
jet, had a seat next to Lady Duff, and the chair
on the near-side was occupied by a small and
snuffy infant, with its finger in its mouth, who
contemplated vice-royalty with the utmost Aplomb.
Lady Duff seemed rather to enjoy ios neighbour-
hood —you see, it kept one chair clear of a possible
bore, at any rate. Mrs. Mackenzie, in a black
serge dress and pink shirt, topped by one of the
most fashionable baked-straw hats, shaped like a
half-rolled pancake, looked workmanlike in the
martial scene; but if I had been one society lady,
who carried a parasol ringed in black and white,
I should quite have expected the shootists to
mistake my brolly for the bull’s-eye.
The housekeeper at Sydney Government House,
who held the keys from the Loftus period, got
married the other day. The bride was a very
popular personage with painstaking society-women
who used to seek her in her lair and artfully glean
the latest intelligence of Lady Carington (who
corresponded with her), and then disseminate it
as special intelligence personally received last
mail. The matrimonial defection of the guber-
natorial femme-de-charye deprives many a five-
o’clock tea-table of vice-regal extracts which gave
the proud narratress the air of one who has the
run of vice-regality in its dressing-gown. “Where
shall we find another,” they say, “ who could
talk about four Governors ? ”
Lady Duff and a daughter or two (small sizes)
graced the wedding in question, and now, I sup-
pose, we will have Potts Point superciliously
attending the nuptial noosinps of its plush-clad
Mary Ann ? The Australian idea is to go as close
to Govmentouse nature as your circumstances
allow, and if you haven’t got a housekeeper to
lose, you may at least be wedding-party to Jane
when she deserts you for a milk-run I
They say that a rather interesting sight at a
certain Victorian prison—where a society jeweller,
who had gone to irretrievable smash, had lodgings
—was the train of society youths and, in one case,
a lady, who called with orders to interview the
confinA. And then there was the outward and
smiling procession with pawnbrokers’ tickets or
directions where to get them—all going to redeem
the family heir-looms which had been left with the
bowled-out diamond-cutter to re-set or boil down
in the halcyon days when his name was over his
shop. It looked as if the governor of the gaol was
giving a garden-party.
Talking about jewellery reminds me of a case
recently tried before a London Law Court when a
faithless Pippo was accused by his Bettina of
stealing four diamond rings from her very fingers.
He took hold of her hand (think of the artfulness
of it!) and slipped the rings off, and the lady
never saw them more ! But the interesting thing
about it was that the magistrate observed that
there was an opinion (it’s only an “ opinion,” you
see) that presents should be returned after
engagements had been broken off, and
though the ex-lover had no right to remove
the rings by force he was discharged, rejoicing to
form a precedent for all English-speaking Romeos
whose jilting Juliets stick to the stakes while they
repudiate the handicap. If it becomes generally
known that a jilted youth can get his presents
back by snatching for them, no coquettish maiden
will dare to do the Block adorned with the spoils
of her victims lest Edwin should legally pounce
upon his own.
But the really clever maiden always can take
her adorer down for at least one piece of jewel-
lery, no matter how much his presents ought to
revert to him. This is how she does it. He
gives her a ring which she wears for a little while,
and then loses (in a corner of a jewel-box, you
know). Of course, he gives her another, but she
doesn’t lose that. Then she breaks it all off, and
sends back ring No. 2, with a great flourish of
sentimental integrity. (N. 8.—1 may add that
this fascinating little scheme was revealed to me
by a widow.)
I think it really is a supported fact that every
well-regulated girl should travel with a trousseau,
for a damsel en route never knows what will hap-
pen. For example, there was that musical Sydney
maiden who set out not a year ago—after a public
send : off—to Europe to do justice to her musical
aspirations and devote herself to Art. But the
other day her parents got a sudden cable —“ Am
married and returning. ” The usual gold-buttoned
sea-dog had arisen on the very boat the maiden
went “Home” by, and, of course, when Nature
stepped in High Art simply wilted at once. After
this matrimonial wind-fall we may expect quite an
exodus of young and soulful she-amateurs who feel
that there really is no scope for the higher culture
in .utilitarian Australia.
The how-de-do about Australian wine-labels at
Chicawgo strikes me as being a dreadfully funny
circumstance. “For example,” says the D.T.
correspondent, “we have wines labelled Shiraz
which no expert would regard as belonging to
that class of wines. In some cases the labelling
is quite inaccurate.” One Australian vigneron
was awarded a vague prize for a nameless, “ but
good all-round wine,” which he had proudly given
to the wine-bibbing world as Madeira, and the
paper in question prints his name large as a
warning to all people who judge a bottle by its
label. But the thing that amuses me most is the
solemn warning itself. Only the other day I
heard of a Sydney youth who called for a very
special brand of something, and when he tilted
the bottle, the epitaph—wet with paste—slipped
off into his hand ! “The label goes along way
when you’re actually drinking,” said a man to me
once. “Imagination fills in the deficiencies. But
it’s next morning you have your doubts.”
There are rods and perches of butterfly-dressing
in the “ Mascotte ” at Sydney Lyceum, and, of
course, Nellie Stewart as prima-donna leads off
with the finery, altho’ Charles Ryley (who is an
artistically-grimed shepherd in the first act—a
nice change from the impossibly-clean peasants
we’re used to —but he ought to wear a sheepskin)
had a bridal suit the colour of a stopped tooth —I
mean white and gold—that became him very nicely
indeed. To my mind, Nellie Stewart always looks
her very best in the Mascotte. The first stage-
tatters she sports, with her hair coming through
the crown of her hat, became her tremendously,
altho’ she goes on to wear a ramping cream
brocade, with an arrangement round the front of
red razor-strops covered with gold, and cerise-
satin train, and a cerise hat with a long white
collar, not to speak of diamonds and cerise-satin
boots; and the same brocade, denuded of the
razor-strops and the gaudy train, and trimmed
with lashings of pearls and gold and silver, which
makes her dazzling bridal costume in the middle
act. The red tights and silver armour showed
clearly that Nature never meant Nellie for skirt-
parts only, and the simple white muslin gown and
bonnet of the last scene was just the sort of
wedding dress a well-regulated girl, who (accord-
ing to Nellie) “ always travels with a trousseau,”
would be likely to have room to pack.
Violet Varley looked pretty in the green satin
and velvet and silver-fringed riding dress of the
first act; but I really must protest against her
very tasteful but altogether blue-
and-silver evening-dress in act two. After view-
ing her extreme modernness one almost expected
Fritellini to arrive in a boiled shirt. Tapley, how
ever, came in a white suit, as if somebody had
been pipeclaying him, but it looked very cool and
becoming all the same. And the most noticeable
points about Courtneidge, as Rocco, were his
spidery yellow legs, which looked like a trickle of
batter against the extremely brilliant background.
The first of “ the Lottie Hyam Quintette Con-
certs ” took place last week at Sydney Y.M.0.A.,
in the presence of Lady Duff, Mrs. Bowden-
Smith, and so on, but the concert was successful
enough to be its own attraction. Lottie Hyam, in
a pink silk gown trimmed with ostrich-feathers,
certainly deserves to have the concerts held in her
name, for she took part in all the instrumental
items and never seemed to fag. The item of the
concert was the “ Kreutzer Sonata,” in which
Rivers Allpress fiddled exquisitely, and Miss
Hyam, although somewhat rigid in her rendering
of the passionate movements, and now and then
almost effacing the pianoforte-score into a mere
accompaniment to the violin—played in perfect
unison with her accomplice in melody ; the result
—an accepted encore. For a Rubenstein concerto
with Sydney Moss at the second piano. Miss
Hyam, who is happy in having absolutely no
mannerisms, was accorded applause and flowers.
I couldn’t help thinking that after his soulful
rendering of the “Kreutzer Sonata,” the “Ave
Maria ” of Schubert must have been like a rest to
Allpress.
The quintette was vocally assisted by Nellie
Young, in a rather dingy gown, but inspiriting
voice, who sang (as she always does) songs in
strange tongues, as if a continental course of
study made a vocalist superior to English. Miss
Young still waves about like a weather-vane
in a choppy breeze. Also, the lady’s bow reminds
you of a person dodging under a clothes-line,
and as she is a vocalist of a very fetching
description, the audience resents these surface im-
perfections the more deeply. Riecardi —probably
the coolest person who ever stood on a concert-
platform, and whose Aplomb is perfectly lovely—
also assisted, and Herr Wentzel, Signor Poden-
zana and Mr. Stevenson joined in the last item.
A Necktie and Apron dance (merely a fancy
title, by the way) took place at Paddington Town
Hall the other Thursday in aid of the poor-relief
fund. The local Mayoress—Mrs. Blackstone,
hon. sec,—Mrs. Helmrich, and Mrs. Williams,
were the ladies who arranged the affair, which
went off very well except when a man in morning
dress arrived on the dais and demanded three cheers
for those “ females !” who had managed matters.
At which indignation very properly seized the
committee. Paradoxically, a lady is a female,
but a female, when publicly alluded to as such, is
not a lady. And even if she practically is, surely
something is due to euphony. John Cash Neild,
M. beautifully shampooed and in the sort of
warpaint that lady novelists describe as “fault-
less,” was present part of the evening. I was
rather amused at the name of one of the rendevous,
the “ Art Gallery ” —so called, I suppose, because
of the —er —paintings round about.
That popular Sydney bachelor, Mr. “Fred”
Bowden, solicitor and notary public, is entering
upon the late Mr. R. A. Young’s legal practice at
Maitland (N.S.W.).
The latest storyette of the Governor of Bara-
taria is that he won’t dance with the duennas
save when the official squares sternly demand the
sacrifice. When, for State reasons, he isn’t con-
voying matronhood through the mazes of the quad-
rille, he is dancing attendance on some divinity
who proudly displays His Ex’s hieroglyphics some-
times twice on her dance-card. “ Pon me soul His
Ex. takes all one’s favourite partners,” grumbled
a handsome society Johnny.
Talking about Governors—a very prominent
N. Mason was casting serious reflections on
the lavishness of the Carington era, the other
day. It seems that Lord C. (according to the
gospel of this wounded individual) once invited a
great horde of Masons to gather together for the
glory of the cause. And when they did, "wine
was opened,” and they drank “He’s a Jolly Good
Fellow,” and Gov. Carington accepted the
hilarious impeachment with the air of a giver of
the feast. N ext day each Mason got a bill for the
fizz he had drunk! Was even the almost-
canonized Carington a professional Governor, too?
But I think it only right to state, in parenthesis,
that my Masonic informant is also an M.P. of
the deepest dye, so the authority is just a shade
dubious.
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMITH.

M’Burney, Wallis & Co.’s Report.
Wool.— We brought forward a catalogue of 300 bales for
our opening sale to-day at the Wool Exchange. There
was a very large attendance of buyers and others inter-
ested present. For good greasy fleece in light condition,
free from seed and burr, there was a good demand, and
also for bulky pieces and bellies. The lower qualities of
greasy fleece were not so eagerly competed for, and
showed an easier tendency. Scouted wool of all classes,
nicely got up, met with a fair demand. Amongst the
brands in our catalogue were the following:—MT/ Bundy,
from Coonamble ; EGB/B, from Coonabarabran ; GO, from
Coonamble ; RT/ Daronble, from Nyngan ; JP, from Tam-
worth ; WSG/, Alison’s Siding. Scoured.—Pß, from
Tumut; M/Dandeloo, and B&C/ Dendaloo, from Danda-
loo. Good merino greasy fleece sold to Bd, crossbred, B|d,
pieces, 6£d; bellies, 4Jd ; locks, 3d per lb. Scoured fleece
to 14Jd, pieces, lOJd; bellies, 9Jd to XOd; locks, 6Jd
per lb.
Sheepskins.— The market is well supplied, and there is
an active demand for all descriptions, prices equal to
last week, full-woolled from 4Jd to 4|d ; superior to sd;
medium growth, 4d to 4}d ; shorts and pelts, 2d to 3Jd
per lb.; green skins, best, 54d to 58d ; medium, 44d to
50d ; pelts and short growth, 9d to 20d each.
Hides.— At the sales to-day the market showed an
advance from Jd to Jd per lb. for extra heavies;
heavies extra up to 3£d; heavies, 2Jd to 2Jd; medium
and light, to l|d; dry, IJd to 2d per lb.
Tallow.— Shippers were not anxious to do business to-
day, and to effect sales the auctioneers had to submit to a
reduction of about £1 per ton. We quote best mutton
from £23 5s to £23 10s ; best mixed, £22 15s to £23;
trade lines from £l9 to £2115s per ton.
Haie, Horns and Bonks.— Horns are slightly easier
this week. Shank bones, £3 10s to £4 10s ; common
bones, £llos to £2 ; knuckles, £3 5s to £3 15s ; horns,
large, 20s. to 30s ; medium, 10s to 18s; tips, 3s to 6s per
100 ; Horsehair, 9d to 13£d per lb ; cow, off stumps, 7id
to 9|d ; on stumps, 3d to 5Jd.
Marsupial Skins.— The market for marsupials ruled
about the same as last week, large grey selling to 50d ;
medium, from 25d to 35d ; small, from 2d ; large red, from
20d to 30d ; small to medium, Id to 19d ; wallaroo, from
2d to 20d ; wallaby—swamp, from IJd to 16d ; rock, from
Jcl to 3d ; scrub, from Id to 15d each ; rabbit, to 7£d per
lb.; bears, Jd to 3d each.
Opossums slightly easier. Best greys, to 11s ; medium,
6s 6d to 8s ; romped and small, 6d to 3s ; reds—best, 7s
6d ; medium and small, from 3s ; blacks, to 17s 6d perdoz.

The Mass of Christ.
BY FRANCIS ADAMS.
ƒ
This temple vast, this prayerful multitude,
These priests and singers celebrant who streamed
In gorgeousness towards the fane that gleamed,
Were to him as some vision is—untrue,
Though true we take it, undeceived the while.
But, since it was unknown to him all through,
And hid some meaning (it might be of guile),
He turned to me and spoke in gentle style :
“ Nay, this,” he said, “is not the Temple, nor
The children of Israel these, whom less sufficed
Of chaunt and ritual. They whom ice abhor,
The Phoenicians, to their gods have sacrificed /”
I said : “Nay, sir; this is the Mass of Christ!”
“ The Mass of Christ?” he echoed. And I said :
“ This is the day when we His birth forth show.
And this is Rome, and far up overhead
Soars the great dome that bids the wide world
know
St. Peter still rules o’er his Church below !”
“ The Christ?” he said, “St. Peter? Who are they?”
I answered ; “Jesus, in the days long past,
And Simon, chief of his disciples !” “Nay,”
He said, “ But of these men the lives were cast
In poverty." I said, “That is all passed !”
Then, as I might, as for some stranger great
Who saw all things under an unknown sun,
I told him of it all both soon and late.
But when I paused and looked, 10, he was gone—
Had left me, and I saw him passing on !
On up the aisle he passed, his long black hair
Cast on his brown and common coat, his head
Raised : and his mein aspect fixed did wear
As one may have whose spirit long is sped
(Though he still lives) among the mightier dead.
He paused not, neither swerved not, till he came
Unto the fane and steps ; nor there he learned
Awe, but went on, till shrilled a sweet acclaim,
And the High Priest from the High Altar
turned,
And raised the golden sign that blazed and
burned!
And a slow horror grew upon us all,
On priests and singers and people who there
gazed.
As that great King, alive beneath the pall,
Heard his own death-service that moaned and
praised ;
So were we all, fearful, expectant, dazed,*
Then unknown murmurs round the High Priest
rose
Of men in doubt, and the whole multitude
Swayed as if gripped in some dire travail’s throes,
While at the last step of the Altar stood
The Man—the Altar-steps all red like blood.
The singing ceased ; the air grew still and wan ;
Save for the organ tones that sighed and died.
The High Priest said to him all gazed upon :
“Who are you?” And the Man straightway
replied :
“ I, I am Jesus whom they crucified /”
His voice was low, yet every ear there heard,
And every eye was fixed upon him fast.
And, when he spake, the people all shuddered,
Asa great corn-field at the south-wind’s blast.
And the Man paused, but spake again at last:
“I am the Galilean t I was born
Of Joseph and of Mary of Nazareth;
But Jahveh, our Father, left me not forlorn.
But breathhd in my soul his sacred breath
That I should he his prophet, and fear not death !
“ I taught * the kingdom of heaven.' The poor, the
oppressed
Were mine. The rich, the priests did hear my cry
Of wrath and retribution that wrung their breast.
Wherefore they caught and took and scourged me. I
Was crucified with the thieves on Calvary /”
At that it seemed the very stones did quake,
And a great rumour grew and filled the place,
Till the pillars, the roof, the heavens above, did
shake,
And fierce, keen cries and arms sprang forth
apace.
Like to a storm-cloud, round that dark, pale
Face.
And yet once more he spake, and we did hear :
“ Who are you ? What is this you do ?” he said.
“ I was the Christ. Who is this devil here
You toorship?" From that silence of the dead.
“ Tear him in pieces !” cried a Voice, and fled.
Howls, yells and protestations ; blazing eyes
And clutching fingers ! It was unloosed hell !
And, in the midst, seized, dragged along with
cries
Of hate exultant, still I saw him well,
His strange, sad Face. Then sickened, swooned,
and fell.
111.
Slowly from out the swoon did I arouse.
Slowly, with pain, and all was weary and still.
Even as a dreamer dreams some sweet carouse
And faints at touch of breath and lips that
thrill,
And wakens then, and yet is dreaming still;
So I. And when my tired eyes look, mine ears,
Echoing those late noises, listen, and
I seek to know what ’fore me now appears.
For long I cannot know nor understand,
But lie like some wrecked sailor on the strand.
Then, bit by bit, I knew it —how I lay
On the hard stone, couched by a pillar tall.
The wind blew bleak and raw; the skies were
grey.
Up broad, stone steps folk passed into the wall,
Both men and women ; there was no sun at all.
I moved, I rose, I came close to, and saw.
And then I knew the place wherein 1 was.
Here in the city huge, the ravening maw
Of all men’s toil and kindly Nature’s laws,
I stood and felt the dreary winter’s flaws.
And by me rose that lampless edifice
Of England’s soul shrunk to a skeleton,
Whose dingy Cross the grimy air doth pierce,
London, that hell of wastefulness and stone,
The piled bones of the sufferers dead and gone.
And when I knew all this and thought of it,
And thought of all the hateful hours and dread
That smirched my youth here, struck and stabbed,
and lit
The plundered shrine of trust and love that fled,
And left my soul stripped, bleeding, worse than
dead,
The wrath grew in me. For all round, I knew,
The accursed city worked on all the same,
For all the toiling sufferers; the idle few,
The vermin foul that from the dung-heat came
Made of our agony their feast and game.
And when, with hands clenched tight, with eyes
of fire,
Sombre and desperate. I moved on apace,
Within my soul brooded a dark desire.
I reached the stream of those who passed this
place,
And turned with them, and saw a sudden Face.
I knew it, as it was there meeting mine,
I knew it with its strange, sad gaze, the eyes
Night-like. Yet on it now no more did shine
As ’twere that inner light of victories
Won from the fiend that lives by the god that
dies;
But very weary, as my waking was,
But stunned, it seemed, and as if cowed at last
Were look and bearing of him. I felt the cause
Even as I looked. My wrath and hate were
passed.
I came and took his arm, and held it fast.
And as some fever-struck delirious man
In a still pausing of his anguish-throes,
Forgetful of it all, how it began,
Rises from off his bed and dons his clothes,
And seeks (his footsteps seek) some place he
knows —
And there he wanders voiceless, like a ghost,
His weariness confusing him, until
Worn out, he helplessly perceives he’s lost:
So was he here, this Man, stricken and still—
Day, place, folk, all—incomprehensible !
My hold aroused him. We looked face in face,
And, in a little, I could watch the wonder
(Where he had seen me), in his great eyes chase
The torpor and oblivion asunder.
Close by there was a porch. I drew him under.
There, after pause, I said : “ What do you here V
He said : “/ came, I think , to seek and see
Something which I much tony for and yet fear.
I have passed over many a land and sea
I never knew. My Father guided me.
“ I think,” he said, “ that lam come to find.
Here in this cold, dark place, what in that blue
And sunny south but wounded all my mind.
But I am weary and cannot see things true.
There is a cloud around me. And with you ? ”
“ Come then,” I said, “come then, if you must
know
What that great saint hath done for us, who is
The second builder of your Church below—
Paul that was Saul, the Prince of Charities !
He saw you once. Now see him once—in this 1”
We went out, side by side, into the stream
Of folk that passed on upwards through the wall
(There was a gateway there), and in the beam
Of the dull light we stood and pillars tall.
And I said “ Look ! ” and he looked at it all.
Somewhat it was as he had seen before,
Yet darker, gloomier, though some hues were
gay.
For all the people had, it seemed, full store
Of quiet ease, and loved the leisured day.
They sang of joy, yet little joy had they.
It was the function of the Rich, of those
To whom contentment springs from booty’s fill,
Gorged to a rank, religious, dull repose.
♦The Emperor, Charles V., the mightiest of the
mediaeval kings, had the weird fancy to assist at a repre-
sentation of his own death-service.

“ The use of a good Soap is certainly calculated to
preserve the skin in health, to maintain its complexion
and tone, and prevent its falling into wrinkles. Pears
is a name engraven on the memory of the oldest inhabi-
tant ; and Pears’ Soap is an article of the nicest
and most careful manufacture, and one of the most
refreshing and agreeable balms for the skin.”

He raised his voice. He spake the words, “ I
will I ”
There came a sound from those about, “ Be
still I ”
And see, as one begrimed with blood and smoke,
The leader of a charge shattered in rout,
Strips off his tatters, bids the lines reyoke,
And leads them back to carry the redoubt:
So was he, strong once more and resolute.
But, as he moved into the aisle, there rose
Men round him, grim and quiet, and a hand
Firmly upon each arm and wrist did close,
And held him like an engine at command.
He cried : “ Loose me ! You do not understand I
“Loose me!'’ he cried, “/, Jesus, come to tell .
No answer made they, but without a word
Moved him away. Their office they knew well
With the impious outcasts who the good disturb
In the worship of their Queen and of their Lord.
’Twas finished ere we heard him ! At the door
They thrust him out. And I, who followed him,
Knowing that he could enter it no more,
Led him away, his faltering steps, his slim,
Frail form within mine arm; his eyes were dim.
Out and away from this I gently guided
Through wretched streets I knew. (Is not my
blood
Upon their stones?) A few poor sots derided.
But we passed on unheeding, as we could.
Till by a little door we paused and stood.
We entered. ’Twas a chamber bare and small
With chairs and benches and a table. There
Sume six or seven Men sat. I knew them all.
1 said : “Food, food, and drink!” Some did
repair
At once within to bring to us their fare.
He sat down by the table listless. But
When bread was brought him, water, and red
wine,
Slowly his white, waste hand he stretched, and
put
On to the bread and brake it, A divine
Light touched his lips, and on his brow did
shine.
They gathered round him with strange, quiet
glances,
These Soldiers of the Army Night hath tried.
One spake the question of their countenances :
“ Who are you ?” And he whisperingly replied :
“ I am Jesus whom they crucified/”
At that a murmur ran among them all.
There was one Man so white he seemed as dead
Save for his eyes, and, when he heard them call; ‘
“ Christ, it is Christ!” he bent to him his head,
And the thin, bitter lips hissed as they said :
“The name of Christ has been the sovereign curse,
The opium drug that kept us slaves to wrong !
Fooled with a dream, we bowed to worse and
worse.
In heaven, we said, He will confound the
strong.
O hateful treason that has tricked too long !
“Had we poor, down-trod millions never dreamed
Your dream of that hereafter for our woe—
Had the great powers that rule, no Father seemed
But Law relentless, long and long ago
We had risen and said, * We will not suffer so !’
“ (4, Christ, O you who found the drug of heaven
To keep consoled an earth that grew to hell.
That, else, to cleanse and cure its sores had
striven,
We curse that name !” A fierce, hard silence
fell,
And Jesus whispered : “ 0, and I as well!”
He raised his face. See, on the Calvary Hill,
Submissive with such pride, betrayed and taken,
Transfixed and crucified, the prey of ill,
Of a cup less bitter had he there partaken,
He then by God, as now by Man, forsaken !
“Vain, was it vain, all vain?” had mocked him
then.
Now the triumphant gibe of hell had said :
“ Not vain ! A curse, a speechless curse to men !”
His great eyes gazed on it. He bowed his head
Without a word, and shuddered. He was dead !
And when I saw this, with a low, hoarse cry
I caught him in mine arms and to my breast,
And put my lips to his that breathed one sigh,
And kissed his eyes and with his name addressed
My Friend, my Master, him whom I loved
best!
“Jesus,” I whispered. “Jesus, Jesus, speak !”
For it did seem that speech from him must
break.
But suddenly I knew he would not speak,
Never, never again ! . . My heart did shake
My brain did burst. I cursed and shrieked
awake!
IV.
Down in the woodlands, where.the streamlet runs
Close to the breezy river, by the dells
Of ferns and flowers that shun the summer suns,
But gather round the lizard-haunted wells
And listen to the birds’ sweet syllables.
Down in the woodlands, lying in the shade
Among the rushes green that shook and gleamed,
I woke and lay, and of my dream dream's made,
Wondering if indeed I had but dreamed,'
Or dreamed but now, so real that dream had
seemed !
Then up above I saw the turquoise sky,
And, past the blowing tree-tops swung aloft,
Two pigeons dared the breeze ecstatically,
And happy frogs, couched in the verdure soft,
Piped to each other dreamily and oft.
And as I looked across the flowery woods,
Across the grass with sun-and-shade bedight,
Under the leaves’ melodious interludes,
Flowing one way, the blessed birds’ delight,
I saw Her come, my Love, clothed on with
light !
Flowers she had, and in her hair and hands,
Singing and stooping, gathering them with
words
Whose music is p ist all speech understands,
But God is glad thereof as of His birds.
I watched her, listening, till I heard the words
Leap from her lips of a bold battle-song,
The clarion clear that silences the strife.
She marched exultantly to it along,
No more a joyous Girl, a sacred Wife,
But a Soldier of the Cause that’s more than life!
O, well I knew the Song that she was singing,
But now she gave her music to my rhyme,
Her rapturous music through the wild woods
ringing,
Asserting Truth and Trust, arraigning Crime,
And bidding Justice “ bring the better time 1”+
0 Love, sing on, sing on/ 0 girt with light,
Shatter the silence of the hopeless hours /
0 mock with song triumphant all the night,
O Girl, O Wife, 0 crowned with fruits and
■ flowers,
Till dawn and day and victory are ours !
Ashfield, Sydney. Francis Adams.

One time on the Palmer (Q.), Jack
Hamilton (now M.P., then known as “the Dr.”)
was stricken with an apparently mortal illness,
and lost 421 b. in nine days, jack’s assistant,
Marshall, wanted him to make his will. Where-
upon Jack got wroth and bet Marshall £1 to 10s.
that he wouldn’t die that week, and a level pound
that he wouldn’t die of that sickness. Having
won both ev.-nts, Hamilton, still “off colour,”
went South for a change. One day in Melbourne,
he called up at (the late) Dr. Bekney’s house in
Oollins-st., to keep a lunch appointment. Sfiid
the assistant there —“Oh, Dr. Beaney has gone to
the to look for yon and tell you that you’re
dead.” Then the man handed Hamilton a Cook-
town (N.Q. ) Herald containing an account of
how he had died in Sydney and how he had
lived “ a real white man,” concluding with the
announcement that the Palmer miners were sub-
scribing to erect a monument over his remains in
Sydney. Jack went to a telegraph office and
wired—“ Failed to die in Sydney, partly because
1 didn’t call there. Will take monument in cash,
please.” He never got it. And he never had the
horse-sense to lie low, secretly supervise the gilt-
lettering of his own epitaph, collar the monument
and carry it always around with him on his
electioneering tours ! The chance he missed ! A
man who could lug around a graven tombstone-
lie,: paid for by loving public subscription, could
never be politically downed.
A Sharp Turn.
( FOR THE BULLETIN .)
There was a very sharp turn in the road about
half-way down the hill, and 1 could see, as I
came up, that the man driving down in the
sulky was going far too fast. He had to skim
close to the corner-post of the paddock in order to
avoid a stump right opposite, and just as he was
making the passage—indeed, I thought he was
through—his mare shied at the stump, and (those
long sulky shafts !) crack into the post went the
near-side wheel. The sulky capsized, of course—
they always do—and rolled over twice. The mare
came down, also rolled twice over, broke both
shafts off, and then made fur the distant horizon.
And the man? When I came up he was un-
conscious ; he was badly cut on the forehead, and
blood was trickling down inside his collar. I
shifted the wreckage from on top of him, and got
some water and splashed him about a bit;
by-and-bye, he opened his eyes. He didn’t seem
able to realise what had happened, but tried
feebly to pull together the torn parts of his pants,
one leg of which had been rent from top to
ankle. The effort was too much for him, and he
“ went off ” once more.
1 was again trying to splash him into his senses
when the parson rode up. He is an English
new-chum, the parson, and a great swell, but
very bashful. I explained matters to him, and
he got off his horse, and helped to resuscitate the
injured man, who “came to’’ after a while, and
looked wonderingly at the wreck around him.
Then the torn pants seemed to strike his recol-
lection again, for he took a splinter of wood from
a broken spoke, and tried to fasten up the rent
therewith. He didn’t ask any questions, and,
when I inquired if he felt better, he made no
reply. I suppose he did not understand. But
the parson “fetched ” him.
The parson was evidently thinking hard for
something to say, but it was'somer time before he
got it out. The man had by this time put two
splinters in his pants, and was silently scooping
out the blood from inside his shirt. There was an
embarrassing silence; then, the parson, diffi-
dently :
“Er —are you a good dwiver?”
The man had by this time discovered the cut in
his forehead, and was wiping at it with his sleeve.
When the parson put his question, the man
stopped abruptly. He looked hard at each of us,
then at the fragments of sulky strewn about, then
at the blood and dust on his clothes. Then he
turned his gore-stained features towards us once
more, and—
“ Well, I be damned !” he said
A. CHEE.
Though Mr. Chamberlain is proud of his
resemblance to the younger Pitt, a member of the
Commons has discovered a great likeness between
Brummagem Joe and Billington, the common
hangman. To such an extent is this the ease,
that a Liberal Unionist member who was shown
Billington’s photograph unhesitatingly pronounced
the effigy to be that of his revered leader. The
Bulletin isn’t surprised. The thing is natural
enough. Judas Iscariot, it will be remembered,
was his own hangman.

Enderby’s Courtship.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The two ghastly creatures sat facing each
other in their wordless misery as the wind died
away and the tattered remnants of the sail hung
motionless after a last faint flutter. The Thing
that sat aft—lor surely so grotesquely horrible a
vision could not be a Alan—pointed with hands
like the talons of a bird of prey to the purple out-
line of the island in the west, and his black, blood-
baked lips moved, opened and essayed to speak.
The other being that, with bare and skinny arms
clasped around its bony knees, sat crouuhed in the
bottom of the boat, leaned forward to listen.
“Ducie Island,” said the first in a hoarse,
rattling whisper; “no one on it; but water is
there . . . and plenty of birds and turtle, and
a few eocoanuts.”
At the word “water” the listener gave a curious
gibbering chuckle, unclasped his hands from his
knees and crept further towards the speaker.
“And the current is setting us down to it,
wind or no wind. I believe we’ll see this pleasure-
trip through, after all and the black lips parted
in a hideous grimace.
The man whom he called Enderby sank his head
again upon his knees, and his dulled and bloodshot
eyes rested on something that lay at the captain’s
feet —the figure of a woman enveloped from her
shoulders down in a ragged native mat. For some
hours past she had lain thus with the grey
shadows of coming dissolution hovering about her
pallid face, and only the faintest movement of lips
and eyelids to show that she still lived.
* • #
The black-whiskered man who steered
looked down for a second upon the face beneath
him with the unconcern for otiiers born of the
agony of thirst and despair, and again his gaunt
face turned to the laud. Yet she was his wife,
and not six-weeks back he had experienced a cold
sort of satisfaction in the possession of so much
beauty.
He remembered that day now. Enderby, the
passenger from Sydney, and he were walking the
poop; Ids wife was asleep in a deck-chair on the
other side. An open book lay in her lap. As the
two men passed and re-passed her, the one noted
that the other would glance in undisguised and
honest admiration at the figure in the chair. And
Enderby, who was as open as the day, bad said to
him, Langton, that the sleeping Airs. Langton
made as beautiful a picture as lie had ever semi.
The sail stirred, filled out, and then drooped
again, and the two spectres, with the sleeping
woman between, still sat with their hungry eyes
gazing over to the land. As the sun sank, the
outlines of the verdure clad summits and beetling
cliffs stood forth clearly for a short minute or two,
as if to mock them with hope, and then became
enshrouded in the tenebrous n;ght.
• * *
Another hour and a faint sigh came from
the ragged mat. Enderby, for ever on the watch,
had first Seen a white hand silhouetted against the
blackness of the covering and knew that she was
still alive. And as he was about to call Langton,
who lay in the stern-sheets muttering in hideous
dreams, he heard the woman’s voice calling him.
With panting breath and trembling limbs he
crawled over beside her and gently touched her
hand, “Thank God, you are alive, Airs. Langton.
Shall I wake Captain Langton? We must be
nearing the land.”
“No, d on’t. Let him sleep. But I oalled you,
Air. Enderby, to lift me up. I want to see where
the raiu is coming from.”
Enderby groaned in anguish of spirit. “ Rain?
God has forgotten us, I ” and then he stopped
in shame at betraying his weakness before a
woman.
The soft, tender tones again—“ Ah, do help me
up, please, I can fed the rain is near.” Then the
man, with hot tears of mingled weakness and pity
coursing down his cheeks, raised her up.
“ Why, there it is, Air. Enderby—and the land
as well! And it’s a heavy squall, too,” and she
pointed to a moving, inky mass that half con-
cealed the black shadow of the island. . “ Quick,
take my mat; one end of it is tight and will hold
water.”
“Langton, La-a-ngton ! Here’s a rain-squall
coming,” and Enderby pressed the woman’s hand
to his lips and kissed it again and again. Then,
with eager hands he took the mat from her, and
hurrying forard to the bows stretched the sound
end across and bellied it down. And then the
moving mass that was once black, and was now
\yhite, swept down upon them and brought them
life and joy.
Langton, with an empty beef-tin in his hand,
stumbled over his wife’s figure, plunged the vessel
into the water and drank again and again.
“Curse you, you brute!” shouted Enderby
through the wild noise of the hissing rain,
“ Where is your wife? Are you going to let her
lie there without a drink ?”
Langton answered not, but drank once more.
Then Enderby, with an oath, tore the tin from his
hand, filled it and took it to her, bolding her up
while she drank. And as her eyes looked grate-
fully into his while he placed her tenderly back in
the stern-sheets, the madness of a mo cent over-
powered him, and he kissed her on the lips.
Concerned only with the nectar in the mat,
Langton took no regard of Enderby as he opened
the little locker, pulled out a coarse dungaree
jumper and wrapped it round the thinly-olad and
drenched figure of the woman.
* * *
She was weeping now, partly from the joy
of knowing that she was not to die of the agonies
of thirst in an open boat in raid-Paeificand partly
because the water had given her strength to re-
member that L mgton had cursed her when he had
stumbled over her to get at the water in the mat.
• • •
She had married him because of his hand-
some fare and dashing maimer for one reason, and
because her Scotch father, also a Sydney -
Tahitian trading-captain, had pointed out to her
that Langton had made and was still making
money in the island trade. Her ideal of a happy
life was to have her husband leave the sea and buy
an estate either in Tahiti or Chili, She knew
both countries well : the first was her birth-place,
and between there and Valparaiso and Sydney her
money-grubbing old father had traded for years,
always carrying with him his one daughter, whose
beauty the old man regarded as a “ vara guid
thing ” and likely to procure him a “ weel-to-dc.
mon ” for a son-in-law.
Mrs. Langton cared for her husband in a prosaic
sort of way, but she knew no more of his inner
nature and latent utter selfishness a year after
her marriage than she had known a year before.
Yet, because of the strain of dark blood in her
veins—her mother was a Tahitian half-caste-she
felt the mastery of his savage resolution in the
face of danger in the thirteen days of horror that
had elapsed since the brigantine crashed on an
uncharted reef between Pitcairn and Dueie
Islands, and the other boat bad parted company
with them, taking most of the provisions and
water. And to bard, callous natures such as
Langton’s, women yield easily and admire—which
is better than loving, for both.
But that savage curse still sounded in her ears,
and unconsciously made her think of Enderby,
who had always, ever since the eighth day in the
boat, given her half his share of water. Little
did she know the agony it cost him the day before,
when the water bad given out, to bring her the
whole of his allowance. And as she drank, the
man’s heart bad beaten with a dull sense of pity,
the while his baser nature called out, “ Fool 1 it
is his place, not yours, to suffer for her.”
* * *
Afc daylight the boat was close in to the
land, and Langton, in his cool, cynical fashion,
told his wife and Enderby to finish up the last of
the meat and biscuit —for if they capsized getting
through into the lagoon, he said, they would never
want any more, He had eaten all he wanted un-
known to the others, and looked with an unmoved
face at Enderby soaking some biscuit in the tin
for his wife. Then, with the ragged sail fluttering
to the wind, Langton headed the boat through
the passage into the glassy waters of the lagoon,
and the two tottering men, leading the woman
between them, sought the shelter of a thicket
scrub, impenetrable to the rays of the sun, and
slept.
And then for a week Enderby went and
scoured the reefs for food for her.
* * *
One day at noon Enderby awoke. The
woman still .slept heavily, the first sign of return-
ing strength showing as a faint tinge in the pallor
of her cheek. Langton was gone. A sudden chill
passed over him—had Langton taken the boat
and left them to die on lonely Ducie? With hasty
step Enderby hurried to the beach. The boat was
there, safe. And at the farther end of the beach
he saw Langton, sitting on the sand, eating.
“ Selfish brute !” muttered Enderby. “I won-
der what he’s got?” Just then be saw, close
overhead, a huge pandanus, and, picking up a
heavy, flat piece of coral, he tried to ascend the
triplicated bole of the tree and hammer off some
of the fruit. Langton looked up at him, and showed
his white teeth in a mocking smile at the futile
effort. Enderby walked over to him, stone in hand.
He was not a vindictive man, but he had grown to
hate Langton fiercely during the past week for his
selfish neglect of his wife. And here was the
fellow gorging himself on turtle-eggs, and his
tender, delicate wife living on shellfish and pan-
danus.
* * *
“ Langton,” he said, speaking thickly and
pretending nob to notice the remainder of the
eggs, “ the tide is out, and we may get a turtle in
one of the pools if you come with me. Mrs.
Langton needs something better than that in-
fernal pandanus fruit. Her lips are quite sore and
bleeding from eating it.”
'file Inner Nature came out. “ Are they ? My
wife’s lips seem to give you a very great deal of
concern. Bhe has not said anything to me. And I
have an idea ” —and then the look in Enderby s
face shamed into silence the slander he was about
to utter. Then he added coolly—“ But as for
going with you after a turtle, thanks, I won’t.
I’ve found a nest here and have had a good square
feed. If the man-o’-war hawks and boobies hadn’t
been here before me I’d have got the whole lob.”
Then he tore the skin otf another egg with his
teeth.
With a curious guttural voice Enderby asked—
“ How many eggs were left ?”
“Thirty or so—perhaps forty.”
“ And you have eaten all but those?’’—pointing
with savage contempt to five of the round, white
balls; “ give me those for your wife.”
“My dear man, Louise has too much Island
blood in her nob to be able to do better than I—or
you—in a case like ours. And as you have kindly
constituted yourself her providore, you had better
go and look for a nest yourself.”
“You dog!”—and the sharp-edged coral stone
crashed into his brain.
* # #
When Enderby returned, he found Mrs.
Langton sitting up on the creeper-covered mound
that overlooked the beach where he had left Lang-
ton.
“Come away from here,” he said, “into the
shade. I have found a few turtle eggs.”
They walked back a little and sat down. But
for the wild riot in his brain, Enderby would have
noted that every vestige of colour had left her
face.
“You must be hungry,” he thought he was say-
ing to her, and he placed the white objects in her
lap.
She turned them slowly over and over in her
hands and then dropped them with a shudder.
Some were flecked with red.
“For God’s sake,” the man cried, “tell me
what you know !”
“I saw it all,” she answered.
“I swear to you, Mrs. Lan ” (the name
stuck in his throat) “ I never meant it. As God
is my witness, I swear it. If we ever escape from
here I will give myself up to justice as a mur-
derer.”
The woman, with hands spread over her face,
shook her head from side to side and sobbed.
Then she spoke. “I loved him once. . . .
Yet it was for me . . . and you saved my
life over and over again in the boat. All sinners
are forgiven, we are told. . . . Why should
not you be . . . and it was for me you did it.
And I won’t let you give yourself up to justice or
anyone. I’ll say he died in the boat.” And then
the laughter of hysterics.
* * »
When, some months later, the Josephine,
whaler, of New London, picked them up on her
way to Japan, via the Carolines and Pelews, the
captain satisfactorily answered the query made
by Enderby if he could marry them. He “rayther
thought he could. A man who was used ter
ketchin’ and killin’ whales, the powerfullest crea-
ture of Almighty Ga«d’s creation, was ekal to
marryin’ a pair of unfort unit human beans in sich
a pre-car us situation as theirs.”
* • •
And, by the irony of fate, the Enderbys
{that isn’t their name) are now living in a group'of
islands where there’s quite a trade done in turtle
and whenever a ship captain comes to dine w.tll
them they never have the local dish—turtle eggs—
for dinner.- “We see them so often,” Enderby
explains, “ and my wife is quite tired of t hem. '

“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper ivhich has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System—one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless newspaper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily a,nd
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form— printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among j
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct pause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the clauns of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, IHE
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. Ihe Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
land, America, and the. colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of 1 cures
Straits, and the digger in the Maonland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of 1 he Bulletin s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact
easily ascertainable from any postal that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, IHE BUL-
LETIN is the one must frequently remaned from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially written reading matter is the brightest,
and Intel, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Austialian
public.

V It , is full early t 0 remind my readers about the spring clean up, but ‘SUNLIGHT SOAP’
will be always welcome by those who take a pride in their home and surroundings, while to help
one over the trial of washing day, and make clothes as white as snow, ‘ SUNLIGHT SOAP ’ is
without exception the best and most economical preparation in the market. Its cleansing power
is wonderful, and yet its purity enables it being used for even the most delicate cambric or lace,
or for cleaning the most choice paint, while for washing woollen goods this soap justly deserves
the attention of those ladies wishing to keep their flannels soft and equal to new. ‘ SUNLIGHT
SOAP,’ cleans anything and everything, is very economical, and greatly lessens household labour,
therefore what more can be needed of a soap.”
Sunlight Soap is used in Her Majesty the Queen’s Laundry.
