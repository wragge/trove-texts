Not too straight—not too wide —a sensible sort of a neck for
a bottle to have. Many other bottles have necks apparently
similar—but there’s a difference! Take off the seal tilt
the neck towards the glass and then you know why the
K.B. bottle has a virtue which no other Lager bottle possesses.
For out of that slim, brown neck K.B. Lager comes gurgling
and foaming filling your glass with a bright amber liquor
which sparkles and bubbles in a cheery invitation to enjoyment.
Because of the purity, the nourishment, and satisfaction of the
beverage which it delivers, you’ll see, if you notice, that more
K.B. necks than others are tilting towards the waiting glasses.
And that’s because so many people prefer a true lager. K.B.
is a TRUE Lager.

The Red Page
£1700 in Prizes for Novels
The Bulletin has received countless
hosannas on the announcement of its inten-
tion to give at least £l7OO in prizes for novels
during the next three years. As the first
competition will close on June 30, 1928,
writers will not have any time to lose. The
first prize in this first competition will be
£5OO, the second £125, the third £75. The
prize stories are to be available for serial
publication in The Bulletin or the
Woman s Mirror, - otherwise all rights are
to belong to the writers, and this includes
not only right of book publication but pic-
ture rights. The winning of the prize will
be so fine an advertisement that large book
sales seem certain; and if the story lends
itself to the films, the picture rights should
also be very valuable. It looks as though
for almost the first time an Australian
novel-writer will have a chance to make a
big thing financially out of his work.
The conditions announced seem to have
given general satisfaction. Of course, a few
questions have been asked. Chiefly what
length must the story be? The announce-
ment mentioned a “full-length” novel. The
Bulletin does not want to cramp anyone’s
style. It wants to give the widest possible
scope to every writer to express himself in
his own way. It will only say therefore that
it cannot believe the'judges would regard
a novel of less than 60,000 words as “full-
sized.” The maximum must be left to
the writer; but a novel which goes bey on < 1
100.000 is not suitable for serial publication,
and something around 80,000 words has been
found most suitable. At the same time,
though naturally The Bulletin will be dis-
appointed if the prize novels are not good
serial stories, it certainly will not ask the
judges to rank them for their merit as
serial stories.
It has also been asked whether they must
be Australian stories. Here, again, The
Bulletin will not cramp the authors in any
way. All it requires is that the work shall
be by Australian-born writers or writers who
are bona fide resident in Australia—Aus-
tralia for the purposes of this condition in-
cluding Maori!and and the South Pacific
islands.
Commonsense About the Movies
More glorious, inconsequential, solen
nonsense is perpetrated in print about t
movies than all other subjects put togethe
not excluding the Eastern mess at Han
kow, the tin hares at Epping, and t
Rotary Clubs’ stirring effort to uplift Mo
cow. Talk about “sex-ridden Yanke
slush” and reams of matter full of adjectiv
like “salacious,” “leering,” “suggestive,” anc
so on are wide of the mark. Noble-mindec
men and women in Yankeeland have
years past formed themselves into clumj
or societies dedicated to the task of jfindin
out what makes the fellow next door laug
and then stopping it, Bowdlerising ha
been developed into a science of incredib
dexterity in the land of Great White Soul
and the casualty rate of films made
US. A. is therefore much lower under th
strictest system of censorship than of thos
made in Britain or Continental Europe.
Even when a censor has the best inten
tions, he is liable to become humorous,
in the case of “The Cradle Snatchers.” Th
pale pink film version, toned down t
almost Y .M.C.A. standard, is rejected, whii
the full-bodied purple stage play show
merrily every night. Any week’s supply
dailies and weeklies will supply more se
atmosphere, illustrated pornography, interes'
ing adulteries, crimes of violence and undei
world fiction than a month’s release o
films. The drapers and chemists’ advertise
ments in any week will supply more titillai
ing pictures than the film posters.
The emasculation of good yarns to mee
censorshio possibilities is just as nasty
fault as the spicing of scenes with a few
crude nudities. Neither tendency, how
ever, marks the real and subtle danger o
the cinema. Just as senseless are the con
troversies, born of trade enmities, as t
where films should be made, why audience
like the Hollywood drammers best and whj
film cannot be made in Australia for Aus
tralians, Maoriland for Maorilanders, Samo
for Samoans, etc. It is as much in point to
ask why The Bulletin is printed by
machines not made in Australia, upon pape
not pulped from Australian trees.
, The American film simply is not. Ai
English novel is gutted and made harmless
by an Anglo-American scenarist, the con-
tinuity is knitted by a young French ex-
journalist, the sub-titles are done by a gir
from Dayton, Ohio, the direction by an
Australian or German or Englishman, the
acting by three Yankee lasses, two English
male beauties and a crew of character
actors from all parts of the globe; the art
titles-will be perpetrated by a Czecho-Slo-
vakian, and the photography by a German
cameraman. Ihe resulting mess is sieved,
colandered, cut, minced and assembled by
a mob, band or team of experts culled from
al the places where the film is likely to
sell, and then it is let loose.
. T he , danger of the Yankee film is that
it is the best. Like the shark, it is perfect
for its job. Its main enemy is the out-of-
date provincialism of the Yankee film com-
panies’ business methods. Obsolete systems,
suitable only for US.A., are imposed on all
foreign branches, and these will eventually
wreck American domination.
The menace of the cinema is more subtle
linn the above brands of attack suggest.
A book requires some mental effort to read
the words that lie on the printed page
require imagination and certain brain pro-
cesses before conversion into images
emotion or thought. The stage play is
slightly easier. Here the transmutation is
assisted by the spoken word, the gesture oi
the actor, the scenery and settings. It still
however, demands attention, some degree
ol concentration and some rationalisation
lhe cinema play, for its part, requires one
thing only—“keeping the eyes open”; the
simplest possible exercise of one sense, and
that sense the easiest of all. Lulled by
accompanying music, the cinema watcher
has only to stay awake, and the anodyne
is taken without the bother of one fatiguing
thought process. This may not possibly
matter to the average movie-sitter. With
or without the cinema, thought processes
or logical processions would be rare with
him or her.
What matters more is that this peculiar
domination bv the purely visual lias out-
run the movies. The modern novel is in-
vaded. It is becoming a series of visual
impressions, a string of snapshots. The
modern play is often a plotless series of
tableaux, novel settings and colored pano-
ramas. Readers and playgoers no longer
concentrate. They cannot fix their atten-
tion, only their eyes.
The cinema, as the most highly specialised
form of one-sense entertainment, has the
largest public ever assembled since David’s
first harp recitals. Its capacity for mischief,
therefore, is greater than that of all other
forms of time-spending put together.
This is not to say that the possibility of
art art of the film is hopeless. Certain
European producers, notably in Germany,
have registered some forward movement
towards an msthete of the film. The beauty
and intelligent handling of a film pano-
ramic-plav such as x Faust” is very comfort-
Maybe from Europe (unlikely from
U.S.A.) will come composers for the film
who will disregard literary sources, novels,
dramas and written stories, and compose
for the new visual art as painters and
musicians do. When that happens, the
cinema may take its place, find its own
metier, and possibly do something towards
enlarging the mind, stimulating the interest,
and creating a new beauty for eyes to see!
Meantime it is blundering along, increasing
mental laziness, dissolving good and bad
novels and plays into hopeless messes, and
dimming and rendering still more helpless
the imaginations of millions of folk who
can ill afford any further loss of their feeble
powers.
One Australian genius plus one well-
disposed Australian millionaire should be
collected and set about the task of doing
something. A grateful world would be pre-
pared to pay for the solution of the cinema
problem a sum nearly equal to the railway
losses of the Commonwealth.

The Artist’s Vision
Modern art has a great deal to pull
against. On the one hand there is every-
where the devastating ugliness created by
power-driven industry. This Franken-
stein’s monster of the machine has so sub
dued us that most urban dwellers are quite
blind (mercifully) to the hideousness in
which they live. Their houses, their furni
ture, their clothes, too, for the most part
form a nightmare from which to wake
screaming. However, the'artist can sur-
mount ugliness. He can even find beauty
where those who look for the pretty-pretty
pass it by. There is on the other hanc
for him a subtler menace, the shackles o'
tradition.
We cannot get back, try as we may, to
the simplicity of early periods and primi-
tive cultures. We cannot recapture theii
freshness of outlook. In painting, as in
e\eij< other art, we are affected, whethei
we will or no, by what other men have
seen and said and created already. Should
we flatter ourselves now and then that we
have achieved something original, we are
bound to discover that it has been done
by some other blighter. Of course, in this
too, there is nothing new under the sun!
Centuries ago, in fact, people felt all the
vexation of having been anticipated. It
was a Roman who cried with pardonable
petulance: “Curses upon those who have
said our good things before us!” But as
time goes on and the records of civilisa-
tions mount up, this disadvantage grows
We are the heirs of all the ages, doubtless •
yet we may be the ages’ slaves as well
It is the attempt to throw off the burden
or the past, to establish an independent
individuality, and to gain directness of
vision that has been largely responsible for
much freakishness in modern painting
Australia has scarcely been affected by the
cults and fashions which have swept like
epidemics, over the art centres of Europe
in the last half-centurv. Cubists Post-
lmpressionists, Futurists and the rest are
little more than names to us. Some, be-
cause of this, would praise Australian artists
tor their sanity; some would call them
hide-bound.
Still, there is one influence that is notice-
ably operating here. It is that of “com-
mercial art.” The maxim of the advertiser

was equal to that obtained with any set that
I have so far tested. The tone quality was

DAVID JONES’
is: “Catch the eye, or, better still, biff it
a good whack if you can!” Therefore, a
good advertisement picture should be- hard
and bright, with no softening of its outlines.
It should challenge attention; to hold it
is not so important. If you go into the
exhibition of the Royal Art Society in
Sydney— to take the most recent collective
display of pictures by a good number of
native artists—you will see almost 200
paintings in oil and water-color. The
average of merit is high. For its effect of
sheer truthfulness, one would like to men-
tion Pearl Sheldon’s representation of a
work-a-day studio. But nearly all the pic-
tures with firm draughtsmanship show a
hardness of outline and a‘ would-be arrest-
ingness.
No picture can be really great unless it
possesses over the strength and solidity of
its drawing a softness as of bloom. It. is
this quality that is invaluably commented
on in Gainsborough’s work. The texture of
the surface is so soft that his pictures were
once described as giving the effect of having
been “blown together.” Only in the* self-
portrait and the group of glass and china by
E. Buckmaster is this quality evident in the
present exhibition. Possibly the air of Mel-
bourne is less light and clear than that of
Sydney. That may account in part for this
Victorian artist’s comparative lack of hard-
ness. (Yet the radiant clarity of the
Italian atmosphere has proved no hindrance
to the production of masterpieces.) The
self-portrait is not without faults of draw-
ing. Still, the finish of the painting makes
it and its fellow stand out as authentic
pictures.
BEATRICE TILDESLEY.
Australian Pronunciation
Some years ago one of the present lec-
turers of the Sydney Teachers’ College had
a class of boys in one of the long rooms
frequently found in Sydney State schools.
He ivas endeavoring to correct a common
mispronunciation of the word “exactly” by
drilling the boys in calling it “egsaktly.”
Suddenly the stentorian tones of the head-
master were heard in the question, “Why
don’t you teach the boys to call it
‘eksaktly’?” At about the same time there
were teaching in neighboring suburban
schools two native-born Irishmen. Pupils
and teachers were changing continually
from one school to the other, and they
spent the first few weeks after their change
in altering their pronunciation of certain
common words such as “subsidence,”
“isolate” and “apparently” to conform to
the directions of their new headmaster.
Each of the headmasters claimed his dic-
tionary as a “recent, reputable and reliable
authority”; but their faith was not in the
same one.
One recalls incidents like these in read-
ing the introduction by the N.S.W. Director
of Education to a book, Australian Pro-
nunciation, by Ruby Board, just issued
by the Sydney Teachers’ College Press. He
states: “The general tendency to standard-
ise conduct and manners suggests also that
standards of speech are desirable. The in-
fluence of the school should lead to the
formation of habits in the use of the voice
that will ensure a pleasing speech. In Aus-
tralia definite characteristics are being
evolved which are not attractive and which
it is desirable to check.”
The book is designed as an aid in bring-
ing about the desired standardisation. It
will probably be regarded as a text-book by
State-school teachers by reason of the
association of the Director and the Teachers’
College with the author, who, in addition
to a wide experience with Australian
children, holds the diploma of the Inter-
national Phonetic Association in English,
French and German. There will be general
agreement with the statement of Miss Board
that education in Australia until recently
concerned itself principally with literary
and grammatical forms. Nevertheless, there
have been many persons who have striven
by precept and example during many years
to stem the tide which has led to the faulty
pronunciation now so prevalent. A perusal
of old files of The Bulletin will show that
the movement for better speech is not a
recent one. Not long ago a dairy-farmer
from the Northern Rivers, meeting a
teacher in Sydney, spoke thus: “How is
Mr. Peter Board getting on? He used to
inspect me 30 years ago. He reckoned that
we couldn’t pronounce the word ‘keow’
and told us that we ought to call it
‘kahoo.’ ” And Mr. Board was not alone in
his efforts even in those times.
One difficulty with efforts to improve
spoken English in Australia has been that
there has been no standard commonly
accepted by teachers. Excellent training in
phonetics has been given to students in the
Teachers’ College, but on leaving college
they have found in the primary schools un-
sympathetic colleagues whose coldness,
united with the grins of juveniles who
recognised the unusual in their language,
has soon extinguished their ardor. It has
not been so in the infants’. schools. The
spoken English in Sydney infants’ schools,
particularly those situated in the better
residential areas, has been singularly free
from the grave defects in pronunciation
common to most Australians. The young-
sters are at an age when they love to ape
the teacher. Trained teachers have there-
fore found receptive pupils, and laid a foun-
dation which should have been successfully
built upon. Llowever, the pre-adolescent of
the primary school has soon developed the
herd instinct, and before long he has spoken
as the crowd.
It is not surprising to find the mispronun-
ciation of the diphthong “ow” commented
upon by Miss Board; but there is sure to
be much discussion among teachers as to
the desirability of it being taught as the
combination of the elements “ah” /as in
“father”) and “u” (as in “put”). Amongst
educated Englishmen the first element
varies from “ah” to “a” (as in “cat”), but
a vowel midway between the two is most
frequently heard.
Discussion will also centre in the question
as to how far the common Australian speech
diverges from good English in the pro-
nunciation of the vowels in the sentence,
“I’ll take the paper.” Miss Board claims
that “Oi’ll tike the piper”, is seldom heard,
but instances common forms of pronuncia-
tion not far removed from it. The custom
of the south of England is followed in the
dropping of the “r” in words like “card”
“kahd.” The objectionable development
which is responsible for the pronunciation
of the final syllable in words like “Sydney,”
“happy,” “lily,” etc. as “ee” instead of “i”
(as in “bit”) is deplored. Some good hints
for the self-teaching of sounds is given, and
some common poems transcribed into Inter-
national phonetic script are printed as exer-
cises. Miss Board would be doing a service
if she arranged for the publication of
illustrative gramophone records similar to
the records by Professor Jones of London
University, for use with her suggested exer-
cises.
The book should be read, not only by
those engaged in the teaching of our youth,
but also by educated parents, without whose
co-operation any effort to improve Aus-
tralian pronunciation must fail.
OLIVER K.
Sea Chanties and Their Origin
Many of the old windjammer chanties
embodied vague references to historical
facts. These songs, no doubt, were handed
down from one generation of seamen to an-
other, much in the same way as the nursery
rhymes of our youth are passed on to our
grandchildren. There is little doubt of the
genesis of this topsail chanty, for instance:
Oh Boney was a warrior.
Chorus: Jean Francois!
He marched to conquer Moscow.
Jean Francois!
But Moscow was a-burning
and so on. There is a reference to the
American Civil War in
A Yankee ship came down the river,
Blow, boys, blow!
She fired a gun that made us shiver,
Blow, my bully boys, blow !
And the rousing capstan chorus of
Sherman’s dashing Yankee boys will never
reach the coast,
So the saucy rebels said. It was a hand-
some boast.
But, then, I guess that they forgot to reckon
with the host
Whilst we were marching through Georgia.
Hurrah ! Hurrah ! We bring the jubilee !
That most tuneful chanty,
We dug his grave with a silver spade.
We lowered him down with a golden chain,
was popularly supposed to refer to the
burial of Lord Nelson, under the soubriquet
of “Old Stormalong.”
But the chanty with the remotest origin
was probably this one:—
Oh, Bullies, have you heard the news?
Willy, Willy, Will went down!
About that Dutchman’s cruise?
Willy, Willy , Will went down!
The Dutchman’s name was Billy Op Zoom.
Willy, Willy, Will went, down!
At his tall main truck he’d lashed a broom.
Willy, Willy, Will went down!
He swore if he’d a favoring breeze
Willy, Willy, Will icent down!
He’d sweep our navy off the seas
Willy, Willy, Will went doicn!
We cut that Dutchman into slats
Willy, Willy, Will went doicn!
Because lie was good to poison rats.
Willy, Willy, Will went down!
There were several other verses concerning
the disposal of that enterprising Dutch-
man, but I doubt if any of the singers gave
a thought to the probability that the chanty
originated in the fertile brain of some
chantyman who sailed in the days of King
Charles 11., who, with the revellers of his
rotten Court, was startled by the thunder
of the guns of the Dutch fleet sailing tri-
umphantly up the Medway. Apparently
that ancient chantyman was more patriotic
than truthful; but he lied in a good cause—
like a modem war correspondent.
But chanties,- with most of the romance
of the sea, departed with the old clipper
ships. The songs that during many a peril-
ous night rose defiantly above the roar of
the gale and the crashing of green seas
tumbling inboard, bringing comfort to
terror-stricken passengers battened down
below, are heard no more. Even the rol-
licking homeward-bound chanty, “Good-
bye-fare ye well,” that used to float across
many a foreign harbor, bringing answering
cheers from the ships that remained, is now
extinct. The old song, accompanied by the
clank, clank of the windlass pulls and the
cheery shouts of “Heave, and lift that hook,
me lads!” is now all expressed with the curt
order, “Get steam in the winch!”
CHIPPS CLARE.
Woman
“In her active life, in her sexual life, in
her erotic life, woman never stands by her-
self. All the countless threads of her acti-
vities are woven round the male sex That
is the conclusion, or one of the conclusions,
that Dr. Bernhard A. Bauer, the famous
gynaecologist of Vienna, indicates in his
great work, “Wie Bist du Weib?” translated
under the title of Woman by F. S. Jerdan
and Norman Haire, Ch. M., M.B. (Jonathan
Cape, London). Bauer insists that “woman
is essentially nothing but sex....and in her
sexuality woman is the devoted slave of
eroticism”; and he gives a striking example.
“Picture a woman preparing for a ball, and
note the elaborate preparations for a few
hours of entertainment. When closely
analysed, women will be found to have
one aim and one aim only; to have the
maximum possible eroticising arid erotic
effect The dress is chosen carefully, and
is cut as low as possible so that breasts,
arms and backs are wholly or partly exposed.
Sheer exhibitionism... .all for the purpose
of making an impression on the male.”
In many ways we may influence Nature,
but the author is convinced that we cannot
determine sex. “We firmly maintain that
the determination of sex is quite beyond
our control, and that at the moment of
fertilisation the sex of the offspring is
already determined. Just as we are com-
pletely unable to change the characters of
any one of the millions of cells in our body
in this or that, direction, so it is equally
impossible to influence the nature of the
germ cells, the ova and spermatazoa.” As
to “maternal impressions” affecting the un-
born child during pregnancy, there is no
scientific proof. “Maternal impressions have
no influence upon the character of the un-
born child. Otherwise would there be any
ugly, badly developed children born with
hare-lip or malformed ears? The germ
cells of the father and mother provide the
original material, and then, uninfluenced
by any external factor, build up the embryo
and produce the child, which has characters
derived solely from the mother and father.”
Thus many a woman will be spared long
hours of anxiety about the appearance and
quality of the coming child. Nature, appa-
rently, knows her job.
Emancipation of women receives short
shrift from this typical German authority.
He lays it definitely down that “it is the
body and the physical endowments of
woman and not her mind which limit the
vocations for which she is fitted.” Obvi-
ously woman is inferior to man in many
physical respects, with periods that render
her still more physically inferior. As Hippie
says, “Woman is a comma, man is a full
stop; at the latter you know where you
are, at the former you must read further.”
Women, however, the author notes, have
a much greater tolerance of pain and are
much more patient and unflinching in the
face of purely physical disturbances than
men. But he sweepingly asserts that “vanity
is the keynote of woman’s character. It
is the most important of all feminine charac-
teristics and throughout the whole of a
woman’s life rules all her actions.”
It appears from this ruthless diagnosis
of woman that Nature is vilely cruel to the
old woman. “The ‘dangerous age’ is really
dangerous, for it destroys the last vestiges
of the woman’s common sense, at least as
far as her own person is concerned. She
begins to envy every woman who happens
to be more v attractive or younger than her-
self Every woman clings to power, and
woman’s power lies in her beauty. The
passion for trying to appear youthful is
only. a defence-reaction against the exter-
mination of sex.... The woman declines
and her beauty fades; but sexual desire
remains.”
It must be remembered that this book is
founded on a conception of womanhood
that is definitely German, and therefore does
not represent the more emancipated Aus-
tralian or British woman; and there are
tinges of the male superiority-complex that
destroy to a considerable extent the scien-
tific character that it assumes.

The Wolf Fade, by Ridgwell Cullnm
(Cecil Palmer; Robertson and Mullens).
A well-told story of the fur-trading country
in Northern Canada.
Blue Murder, by Edmund Snell (Fisher
Unwin). The jacket of this amazing piece
of fiction describes it as “a thriller of the
first degree.” It is a quest after a criminal,
and the three half-crowns it costs to hear
about it could be better spent.
The Adventures of Louis Blalce and Notes
from My South Sea Log, by Louis Becke
(Warner Laurie.) Two volumes forming
part of a collected edition of the author’s
works. Bulletin readers of an earlier
generation will place them on the library
shelf that bolds Herman Melville's “Typee”
and “Omoo” as the work of one who knew
the life of the South Pacific with an in-
timacy beyond Stevenson’s and out of the
range of present-day writers.
A. G. Rowlandson (N.S.W. Bookstall
Co.). This little brochure —a tribute to the
memory of a genial, kindly man who, himself
an Australian, did in his day more for our
writers of imaginative literature than any
other publishing firm in the Commonwealth
- -comes to hand at a timely season; the eve
of Australian Authors’ Week. The booklet
contains not only a biographical sketch of its
subject, but also a number of appreciative
notices. It has also a reference value in
collected notes on the lives and works of
the many Australian writers who have con-
tributed to the popular and widely-distri-
buted Bookstall series. Many of the authors
on the list —Jack McLaren, Beatrice Grim-
shaw, Dale Collins and Roy Bridges, among
the living—-have since the days when Row-
landson put their, books on his stalls won
a reputation overseas. An interesting and
well-produced little memorial.

Mountain Parrots
This morning over wintry grass
Bent with the wind and brown with frost
I heard the rich-robed parrots pass—
A flight of crimson, seen and lost.
Along the dry and rainless hill
The winter mourned in tree and leaf.
In the deep gorge the mist lay still,
A veil for some too silent grief.
-The slow day raised a heavy head,
Blinked with a doubtful yellow eye ;
In lines the thin, cold clouds were spread
To hide the mockery of the sky.
Act back the gay birds came once more,
Crimson and green and royal blue;
They perched, they stayed beside my door ;
All day from stem to stem they flew.
The mountain magpies’ heavy wings
Made gusty rustlings overhead.
Bike arrows shot from fairy strings
The flights of red-lieads lightly sped.
And grey and greyer fell the light;
But with their pomp of radiant plume,
Like magic fires in poise and flight
The parrots lit the growing gloom.
Summer has no such flowers as these.
The rose and all her sisters pine
To reach such color ecstasies.
In dreams of dew and lioney-wine
They blossom on the wind-bent grass,
They set a glory on the weed;
A hundred years they flame and pass,
Rich in a handful of brown seed.

The Beach Road.
By pebbled ridge and sandy run
The golden aloes stab the sun ;
And tamarisk and peppercorn
l*ink tassels trail above the thorn
That, jealous, guards the pasture’s rim
Against the little white road's whim—
The vagrant little road that slips
For ever west to find the ships!
Its leisured way no traffic knows
Save where the scudding blossom blows;
Save where, untrammelled, children trace
Their hopscotch symbols on its face,
Or, laughing, whittle aloe shafts
And bind them into crazy rafts
And follow, shouting still, and swift
To gain the sea, and watch them drift.
Through drowsy noons the sunlight lies
In golden pools, and dragon-flies
Flash scornful by the hampered bees
That drone amid pittosporum-trees.
Beyond the bend, where lovers stray,
Tall oleanders lift and sway,
Beneath whose cool pink-laden boughs
Meet man and maid to murmur vows.
Till dreaming hand-in-hand they reach
The tufted dunes, and tread the beach. . .
And lo ! across the sea the rays
Of sunset gold a new road blaze
Within whose bounds the schooners bide
With chafe and fret the coming tide ;
And so the little road at last
Finds spar and hull and tapered mast!
S.A,
MADGE R.C.
Dead.
I wonder if she knows,
Lying upon that grassy, dawn-ward hill.
Where first the sun leaps, where the moon-
rays fill
Wide aisles between the graves, where the
wind blows
The ceremonious pine-trees o’er and through,
All that I say and do?
I wonder if she lies
Sleeping and silent in herself; or does
The old life stir where that deep twilight
flows
About her body, binding her grey eyes;
And does she know how in the niglit I
came.
Praying, and called her name?
I cannot understand
Why that fair body of hers should fall
away
To dust; or why she sleeps through night
and day
The same; I wonder whether her young-
hand
Feels for another, lonely, in the white
Ineffably quiet night.
And are there dreams for her,
Waking and changing in her fast-shut
eyes ?
Nay, nay; I pray that silently she lies
Without a dream, without a sigh or stir....
I could not bear it if I thought she knew
All that I say and do.

The A methyst Ring.
A mountain tarn amid grey granite tors
Where only purple peaks find mirroring;
A sunlit pool where nodding violets gaze
At their sweet reflex, and where iris swing.
When the gold chalice of a summer’s day
Is empty, though beneath its pouted lip
A last drop lingers, quivering to a star.
As twilight dusts into the goblet slip,
Before the purple cope is planet-hung,
Or passion at the heart of midnight stirs,
This gem is as a lake some genie made
Out of a dream, and filled with lavenders.

The Silent City.
What spires are these that rise to pierce the
sky?
What pinnacles, what buildings these of
stone
That stand oblivious of the passer-by,
The distant city’s murmured monotone?
None pass along these thoroughfares; the
street
Is empty. Through the hush, pale Silence
creeps,
Grey-stoled and veiled, upon her noiseless
feet;
Then bows her head upon her arm, and
sleeps.
Here cross and urn and earven marble white
In solitary dignity uprear
Their rigid forms; in wind and storm’s
despite,
Their silent message speak from year to
year.
With memories of lives and loves gone by
They draw thought downward to the
darkened slope;
Then point us upward to the arching sky,
And bear their witness to the larger hope.
Such peace is here. No careless laughter
breaks
Upon the utter quiet; never breath
Of errant wind a-rustling music wakes,
Or stirs a ripple on the calm of death.
Asleep the city of the dead? Ah, no—■
Deserted. From each stately tenement,
Built for repose of body, long ago
The earth-free spirit winged his way con-
tent.
This city is deserted. Far from here
In some serener clime these sleepers be,
Finding new homes in a celestial sphere,
New gates flung wide upon Eternity.
What visions must be theirs; what sounds of
song
Must till the Courts of Life; what grand
refrain
Of rest from toil, of battles to the strong,
Of gladness after tears, peace after pain.
How small and poor our life compared with
theirs,
Ho rich and boundless! Blest and happy
we
If they bestow on us their thoughts and
prayers,
They, the glad freemen of Infinity.

Fate.
“How shall I spend the years?” I cried
And planned and dreamed in a fool’s
content.
Then 1 woke to gaze o’er an ebbing tide,
Aghast ! for the years are spent.
Spoil and waste of the winds that trod
Ever a wider, wilder sea.
“llow shall I spend the years?” Ah God,
How have the years spent me!

Camel Teams at Bourke.
The camel teams are tiling by,
The desert ships drift o’er the plain ;
I catch the tnrbaned Afghan’s cry.
From out the haze and dust again
The wondrous East appears ;
Out where the palm uprears
I hear the silvery hells,
The tinkling camel hells,
And ’neath the opal-tinted skies
The minarets of Mecca rise!
And down the Darling spaces wide
The faithful trudge with weary feet—-
Out by the lone Euphrates’ tide
They swoon beneath the noonday heat.
And far away, out back,
Where parched lands gape and crack,
Still sound the silvery hells,
The tinkling camel bells,
As by the Darling flood I lie
And hear the bronzed muezzin’s cry.
So to my vision seas and lands
Afar are near. The marvel grows:
On yonder plain Damascus stands,
Out there the Grecian Isles uprose;
And through the dust and saffron haze
I see white-crested Hermon rise;
I dream the dreams of other days,
Of age-old loves and mortal ties,
Of Antony and Egypt’s boast,
Of her who ruled by the Nile,
Fair Cleopatra; Pharaoh’s host;
The Pyramids ; the crumbling pile;
While o’er wide seas Phoenicians rove
In galleys bearing purple dyes,
And splendid phantoms ever move
Across the scene before my eyes—
Proud Delhi, with its burning sand;
Hot noons on sun-scorched Persian plains;
Bazaars of Shiraz, Samarcand;
Great rivers swollen by the rains;
And all the wealth of Asia spreads
From Everest to Singapore,
And wind-blown palms lift up their heads
Down by the Coromandel shore;
Rlue as a peacock's breast, the sea
A plane of wondrous beauty lies ;
On the dim coast foam-cities rise
While o’er the lonely wastes I hear
The bells, the camel bells.
The silvery camel bells;
And ’neath our purpling western skies
I see the mosques of Bagdad rise!

Junee,

Dear Sirs,—ln February, 1925, I took delivery of a line of Weaners which I purchased
on Monaro, and after I got them home they turned, out, to be very flukey and were dying
like flieS. I purchased a ton of “LIX-ALL” through your Agents at Junee, and began
giving it to these flukey sheep. Very soon I saw an improvement in them and they left
off .dying, and in the course of a few months they had left off coughin' and they were
quite sound and healthy. It gives me much pleasure and satisfaction U recommend the
“LIX-ALL” to anyone who may have flukey sheep..
Kindly send me another half ton immediately. Yours faithfully,
“Eurolie,” Junee Reefs. JOS. IIEFFERNAN.

Deal' Sir, —I already have a supply of “LIX-ALL,”
and have used same in the dry time, and 1 find it
to be a good lick; sheep put on condition, whilst
other sheep on other licks lost condition. Would
like to tell you that I have recommended it to
others in this district, and will do by best for
you.
I remain, Yours truly,

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1927.
IN THE RED DAY.
During the business year which closed on
June 30 Australia pursued its familiar way.
That is to say, it tried to live up to a repu-
tation for combining luxury with avoidance
of work, or at least avoidance of reasonable
production; for lack of ambition to pay its
way or do anything approaching that feat;
for dependence on the capitalist (largely
the foreign capitalist) to whom its Langs
and Gardens profess such noisy hostility;
for taking no heed as to the morrow; and
for callous disregard of the fate of the next
and subsequent generations. In all these
lines of effort it achieved notable success.
Among the half-dozen -English-speaking
communities which are big enough to be
described as nations there was no other like
Australia, and no other which wouldn’t
have considered itself disgraced if it had
been like Australia. Imports, valued at
£164,744.927, were £13.000,000 more than in
the previous year, and constituted a record
for Australia. The exports which were sup-
posed to pay for them were £4,000,000 less
than those of the previous year, and roughly
£20,000,000 short of paying for the imports,
and about £51,000,000 short of paying for
imports and meeting other external lia-
bilities—interest and miscellaneous items.
When so much of the country’s real and
imaginary requirements were supplied by
persons outside, including the non-unionist,
the sweated and the discolored, there is
naturally less work available for white in-
habitants inside, and the falling-off in ex-
ports is further evidence that a great deal
less was done. Some of this effect is due
to the fact that on certain benches sit cer-
tain legal gentlemen whose chief business it
is to give judgments tending to reduce pro-
duction and greatly raise the cost of pro-
duction. If they give any other kind of
judgment it is ignored or altered. Another
contributing fact is that so many men lead
an easy life on the construction of almost
unproductive public jobs where the wages
paid have little relation to the work done,
and so many at running these undertakings
at a loss when completed.
In no year before 1918-19 did the import-
ing business attain to even half its present
dimensions, and not till after 1919-20 did
the failure of exports to pay for imports (to
say nothing of paying the ever-increasing
interest bill) show signs of becoming
chronic and desperate. In the subsequent
seven years it has been so chronic that the
amount of shortage to meet external bills
has been approximately £253,000,000. That
helps to explain why the aggregate debt,
which was 704 millions in 1919, was 1014
millions in 1926, the rise being continuous.
What it is in 1927 will be known later.
The progress of some other English-
speaking States has been varied:—
During the period in which Australia’s
exports were £60.000,000 short of paying for
its imports and £253,000,000 short of paying
for imports and covering the foreign interest
bill, Canada, the United States, South
Africa and Maoriland paid for their imports
with exports and something more, the sur-
plus being available to pay interest or to
pay off principal, or to lend at high interest
to spendthrifts and loafers with estates to
mortgage.
Great Britain, the United States and Canada
have paid off very large amounts of debt
since their respective “peak” years—Britain
about. £190,000,000; the United States
£1,500,000,000; Canada £13,000,000. On
the other hand Maoriland has added about
£40,000,000 and _ South Africa about
£46,000,000 to their debts in seven years.
These figures are none too good, but they
compare favorably with those of Australia,
where the new debt occurred in the last
seven years for which complete returns arc
available was £309,000,000.
In South Africa and Maoriland the rail-
ways are Government property, and the
Canadian Government owns and operates
over 21,000 miles of line, which is not much
short of the Australian total. So the hack-
neyed plea that public railway ownership
puts Australia in a category by itself doesn't
avail.
* * * *
During most of the recent years while
things have been going from bad to worse,
the better elements of the community have
shown no signs that they saw anything amiss.
If they did show occasional signs, they
soon found out how much easier it was to
get along by corrupting their way with
loans, and they came to regard these as
part of the established order of things. But
the fact that they allowed themselves to
become comatose is not going to save either ,
the country or themselves. A very large
and organised and misled section of the
nation has been taught (mostly by imported
adventurers who are tolerated here as they
are nowhere else) that it is grossly ex-
ploited, underpaid and overworked, and not
even the highest basic wage or the shortest
44-hour or 40-hour weeks makes any differ-
ence in this view. According to this noisy
school, the great accumulation of loan
money which helps to make easy living is
something legitimately earned. It comes
as a matter of right, and there ought to
be much more of it, and but for the evil
doings of the common enemy (whoever he
may be) there would be much more.
Should, then, the flow stop suddenly, with-
out any time for the long-neglected pre-
paration, this crowning wrong, brought
about by the common enemy (whoever he
may be), added to the long list of previous
alleged wrongs, ventilated daily in the arbi-
tration courts, will, it is hoped and even
expected by the Red element, bring about
the great insurrection. Then the streets will
be red as well as the flag and the hjunn.
We shall of course try to throw the respon-
sibility for the horrors on to “the Com-
munists.” But those of us who corruoted
and misled the population will in that red
day have a terrible amount of the trouble
to answer for.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Well Done, McCormack!
The political education of Labor Premiers
has been a costly business, and in Lang's
case the money has been thrown into the
gutter. But the men of to-day, with that
one stunning exception, are at least the
equals in promise of their predecessors.
Tasmania’s Lyons is giving a fair return
for a relatively small outlay, and there are
bright hopes of Hogan —thus far he has
shaped well. Westralia, moreover, has con-
trived to grow prosperous under -the
mild rule of Collier, who has had the good
sense not to meddle with or overtax the
men who are doing the work in the wheat
belt and the new pastoral provinces; one
thing can be as damaging as the other.
And Queensland is getting results from its
William McCormack, who served under
Theodore and Gillies before he became
Premier. McCormack has learned that
borrowed riches don’t make a country rich,
and that State socialism is no short-cut to
the Millennium. He has learned also that
the interests of the whole are greater than
those of any section or class, and that when
Constitutional authority is challenged by
persons w r ho claim to sneak for Labor or
anything else, a Government must fight
He is fighting accordingly.
The A.R.U. is a union with an unfortu-
nate history. Looking back on the events
which began with the 1917 strike in N. S.
Wales, one is driven to the conclusion that
the members would have been better off
without a union so infested with Moscow
blatherskites. Two years ago the Red
bosses in Queensland worked up a strike
against the Gillies Government. McCor-
mack was for resisting then, but Gillies
abjectly surrendered, the increased wages
refused by the State Arbitration Court
being conceded by Act of Parliament
amidst shouts that “the Revolution” had
triumphed. Demands for further increases
followed every few months or so. They
were rejected by the Board of Trade, which
superseded the Arbitration Court (Gillies
became a member), on the ground that the
railways were steadily losing £1,750,000 a
year. In the South Johnstone sugar-mill
strike the Red bosses saw a chance to plant
their boots on the Government’s neck
again. Regardless of the A.W.U.’s efforts
to localise it, they ordered the mem-
bers of their organisation not to handle
South Johnstone goods—in the jargon of
their tribe they declared South Johnstone
“black.” Great was their astonishment
when counter-orders were issued by the
Railway Commissioner with McCormack's
concurrence, for they reckoned on McCor-
mack proving as piiant as Gillies. The
district raihvaymen decided to obey the
Reds, and, on actually refusing duty, were
paid off. This went on until the number
of dismissals was approaching the second
hundred. Then the Premier announced
that, as it was impossible to carry on a
Government service in which men recog-
nised an authority other than that of the
Government, the whole body of emnloyees
would have to be put off. Re-employment
was promised to those who gave an under-
taking in writing “to observe and obey
the rules and regulations as printed in the
existing book of rules and regulations,
which rules and regulations were in force
during my previous term of employment.”
So no trains ran in Queensland on Satur-
day afternoon, although they won’t be idle
long. The usual foul insults have been
hurled at McCormack, but he can afford to
despise them, as all the cards are in his
hands. By his exertions he has rescued the
Queensland railways from Red rule. By his
example he has probably saved the N. S.
Wales railways from a Red strike.

The Quality of Mercy.
In all except our highest courts the ten-
dency is towards the flabby administration
of justice that encourages crime. The fine
and the first offenders provisions of the
Crimes Act are used far beyond their proper
limits. Reckless men and youths make our
highways avenues of peril to citizens going
on their lawful occasions. If an offender is
brought before the Court, though he may
have acted with disregard of life, the rain
of mercy falls on him in a plenteous shower,
and he is either released on probation as a
first offender or fined in a small sum which
he instantly produces from his pocket. In-
deed, the other day it came out that motor
drivers form little insurance funds to pay
out of a common purse the price
demanded for their offences. In graver
matters of crime the tendency is no less
manifest; and it all points to a weak-
ening of the social character. William
McDougall, the eminent psychologist, laid
it down that “disinterested indignation is
the ultimate root of justice and of public
law.” Once let the fire of that indignation
burn dowm to ashes and there will be an
end to civilisation. Adequate punishment
for crime, adequate but void of cruelty, is
essential to our social life, and a general
view of the modern tendency to regard
crime and criminals not with aversion, but
with a slobbery sympathy, is fraught with
grave danger.
In past years a recommendation to
mercy from a jury was a rare occur-
rence. To-day it is becoming a sort
of tag to every finding of a jury—a kind of
orthodox formula. It is, in the first place,
no part of a jury’s duty to make any recom-
mendation of either severity or clemency,
and how the custom crept in no legal
pundit can say. The obvious absurdity of
any such recommendation follows from the
fact that it is made before the character
of the accused has been disclosed. Up to
the time he is found guilty, the jury does
not know whether the life of the prisoner
has been one stained scarlet with crime, or
one clean of serious offence. All the same,
in blind ignorance arid moved by sheer
sentimentality, the jury claps on its recom-
mendation. The Judge is not required to
give any weight or any thought to such a
recommendation. So far as he is con-
cerned it is mere surplusage—something
over and above the duty of the jury.
Unfortunately, however, the Judges them-
selves seem not untainted with this spirit of
slobber which overwhelms the righteous and
disinterested indignation against social
offenders. Recently in Melbourne two
cases of serious crime came before a Judge
in General Sessions. In one case the
offender was found guilty of having incited
another man to conspire to defeat the ends
of justice. His Honor was eloquent on the
gravity of the offence. “The unpolluted
administration of justice was of funda-
mental importance,” so he declared. “Pos-
sibly no more serious charge other than a
capital, offence could be committed in any
State.” For this next-to-capital offence the
guilty man got 12 months’ gaol, and the
Judge said he might lane made it a bit
more but for the jury’s recommendation to
mercy—made on Heaven knows what
ground, and no more binding on his Honor
than a cobw’eb! In the . other case the
offender had brutally attacked an unarmed
constable with a heavy weapon. He, too,
was found guilty, and the fatuous jury
added the usual tag of mercy. It knew
nothing at all about the man anti his char-
acter. It was then disclosed that he had
come to the court from prison, where he
was undergoing a sentence of four years,
and that into the preceding seven .years he
“had crammed a very extensive criminal
career.” The present wounding charge was
the second of its kind. The man got two
years and in delivering the sentence his
Honor made the extraordinary statement
that it “marked not his full view of the
proper punishment but his opinion miti-
gated by the recommendation of the jury.”
It looks as though the whole community
is becoming incapable of expressing that
“disinterested indignation” against wrong-
doing “which is the ultimate root of justice
and of public law.”
Jock Garden Considered as a Rabbit.
Certain well-meaning and sentimental
gentlemen, in the early days of colonisation
in Australia, imported some rabbits as pets,
not dreaming that posterity would put
another “s” into the word. The habit of
making pets of pests has endured, despite
the terrible example. Latterly it has taken
the form of pretending that any talkative
immigrant who calls his hearers slaves and
advises them to cast off their chains is
tremendously important. Cases in point are
the climb to industrial power of Jock
Garden and Jacob Johan son. Neither of
them has shown any capacity for admini-
stration or organisation. Neither of them
has the slightest claim to be regarded as
intellectual. Compared with such men as
Donald Macdonell of the A.W.U. and
scores of other industrious, painstaking,
plodding persons who build up trades
unions, fight their battles in the courts, and
do their level best to put another bob into
the members’ pay-envelopes, Carden and
his Scandinavian comrade-in-communism
stand like a couple of weeds in a sturdy
forest. But not in the estimation of the
newspapers. In America, or in J. Bull’s
country, the childlike egotism, of such
people would be given scant encouragement.
In Australia their lightest whisper rever-
berates in the columns of the press like
thunders from Sinai.
Mr. Garden, who is supposed to be vio-
lently opposed to the very idea of govern-
ment, has more say in the government of
New South Wales and the direction of its
industrial affairs than aiiy elected represen-
tative of the people, any captain of indus-
try, any leader of intelligent, thought in the
State. When Mr. Garden gets annoyed
almost everybody trembles. He is allowed
by the Courts to interfere in matters in
which he has no right to interfere, and when
the Bruce-Pages in a spasm of unwonted
firmness refused to let him go to China to
discuss ways of kicking John Bull in the
stomach, every daily newspaper in the land
printed his silly threats to isolate Australia.
The brightest bit of humor that has en-
livened the morning journals of Sydney for
a decade was a picture showing the beaming
happy faces of the communist comrades
who took a lot of working men away from
their jobs for the day to make a demonstra-
tion about Sacco and Vanzetti. There
was a grisly banner, and a lot of violent
talk. But when the press photographer shot
the shutter Garden. Lyons and their cob-
bers couldn’t conceal their joy. They were
going to get publicity, and that was what
they wanted most, and what they lived
on, so why worry about two alleged com-
munists who are supposed to have been
wrongfully convicted of murder? Possibly
they weren’t or didn’t, and everyone knows
Sam’s judicial methods arc a bit slanted,
but the main thing was to get the ad.
They manage these things better in other
parts. When Noel Lyons arrived in Maori-
land on a ship whose firemen had been
induced by him to strike for ham and eggs
for breakfast, the newspapers mentioned in
a cold, distant way that he had been brought
before a beak and put in quod. Some of
them quoted the section of the still-active
War Regulations under which the comrade
was crucified, and some didn’t. But he
wasn’t interviewed, and what he thought
about his martyrdom wasn’t expected to
interest anybody. After he had been a
fortnight in a dungeon the Law came along
and asked him how he liked it. He said
he didn’t like it at all, and wished he had
the wings of a dove. The Law smiled
wintrily, and concurred with the sentiment.
He went back to Australia on the next
boat, to find himself famous, feted and
feared. Maoriland treated him as a rabbit,
and he behaved accordingly. Australia


greeted him as a very fine lion, and lie at
once commenced to sprout a mane.
The process of turning rabbits into lions
-a a favorite newspaper industry in Aus-
tralia, but it’s too expensive. These lion-
ised human rabbits are each capable of doing
more harm in a year than an extra hundred
million of ordinary bunnies could accom-
plish. The newspapers that made them
can, in time, unmake them, or reduce them
to their proper proportions, if they refuse
to treat them as anvthing but rabbits.
Kaiser Jack and Kaiser Bill.
N, S. Wal es is filled with the political dust
and clamor of a situation which looks in-
conceivably mixed. Yet perhaps it is'less
unaccountable than it looks. A bullying,
domineering Premier, of many shifts and
expedients, but not credited with much in-
telligence or much courage, was stampeded
into joining up definitely with the Red ele-
ment. Because it was the loudest crowd
it looked like the strongest and the best
support and protection for a big man with
a tendency to funk. Before that he had
been Red on one side and White on the
other so that he could assume a different
political complexion by turning round, but
now he became Red on both sides, though
he occasionally said he was Blue. Straight-
way his most disreputable friends took
charge of the insanitary kerosene-tin con-
taining the selection ballots, and proceeded
to stuff the coming Labor Parliament with
their political kith and kin. Then having
assured themselves that the capture of the
Premier, the small-minoritv Cabinet and
the insanitary kerosene-tin made the com-
ing of a Communist Government certain,
their heelers started to distribute, with great
rashness and even more than usual liberality,
samples of what Communist administration
would mean.
Among many happenings the great Lith-
gow ironworks were held up with a demand
for large and immediate increases of pay.
Job control resumed with renewed vigor on
the wharves, and personal violence was
interspersed, heavy articles of food being
thrown at passengers and others. Prelimi-
nary warnings were given of a new shipping
strike. The seamen are working under an
agreement which was fixed for two years
certain, and terminable afterwards at three
months’ notice. Had the notice been given
it would have carried the matter 6ver the
election, but in Red haste to show how
nasty they could be before the election, the
imported bosses of marine unionism tore up
the treaty all of a sudden, and presented
their new log right off. It contained more
grotesque demands than a raft of logs which
went before it, but the main feature was
that it would more than double and perhaps
treble the bill of expenses. Among the
demands were 11s. 6d. special allowance
for board and lodging while on leave, and
an hourly motor service for the use of the
men during Saturdays and Sundays in port.
Also there was involved a prospect of re-
construction of ships to make room for
greatly increased crews.
Amid all this pandemonium the position
of Kaiser Lang isn’t widely different from
that of Kaiser Hohenzollern when
William was approaching his last ditch.
Each made a lordly pretence of running
the show, and in each case the General
Staff was running it, and was almost as
confused as the Kaiser himself. Meanwhile
such constructive features as there are in
the Lang programme depend on his pros-
pects, should he get back to office with a
Communist party and programme, of per-
suading people in London, New York and
elsewhere that he and his mob are respon-
sible persons to whom immense sums may
be lent with safetv.
Still Another Millennium.
There is no stopping the American when
idealism bites him. There blew into Mel-
bourne the other day out of a German
steamer the advance guard of the Inter-
national Police. It consisted of a lady and
three serious young men and they arrived
at The Bulletin Office in the skeleton of
a motor-car. The Australian Customs, be-
ing base materialists, had chopped off the
rest of the vehicle because the expedi-
tion would not pay the duty. It expects a
new body to be donated locally. The
nucleus of four has already recruited four
young Australians. Who that is young and
adventurous and wants to see the world
wouldn’t, be recruited? At present the full
strength of the International Police is 38.
One division is tearing across Africa. An-
other is establishing branches in China and
Siberia. Still another has headquarters in
Vancouver.
The naive genius who conceived this
method of establishing world peace is
Captain Walter Wanderwell, of Atlanta,
Ga. When some members of the League of
Nations proposed to create an international
army which it could hurl at any country
that disobeyed its orders, Captain Wander-
well decided it was a good idea. Although
the League has since cast the dangerous
notion from it, he still thinks it is a good
idea. His method of getting it put into
operation is to quarter the world in gift
automobiles getting signatures to a gigantic
round robin—and subscriptions. With the
subscriptions more policemen are appointed,
and so the movement grows.
They have collected contributions from
Chinese generals, Turks and even Soviet
officials. Who is prepared to deny that he
stands for world peace, even if he has to
pause in cutting his neighbor’s throat while
he says it? The movement is conducted
with all the slickness of the American go-
getter. Seventy-five p.c. of the contribu-
tions go to headquarters; the other 25 are
the go-getter’s commission. There seems to
be no reason why the organisation should
not expand for ever, until there are thou-
sands of gift automobiles filled with mil-
lions of policemen hounding down the last
civilian for his sixpence. By that time
Captain Wanderwell will have been made
high priest or chief detective of a billion-
dollar police-station and there will be no
international crime, because everybody will
be in the international police force.
Cargo Thieves.
Australian ports have long had an evil
reputation for cargo pillaging. The wharl-
laborers, against whom the' imputation has
been chiefly directed, assert that the pillage,
if any, might have occurred as easily at
the port of shipment or after leaving the
wharves as at the Australian end. But a
recent, report published in London by the
Shipowners, Merchants, Chambers of Com-
merce and Indemnity Associations pricks
that pretty bubble. It states that 80 per
cent, of one indemnity association’s round-
voyage cargo claims for three years origi-
nated in the Australasian trade, 50 p.c.
being on Australian cargoes and 30 p.c. on
those for Maoriland. In this bad pre-
eminence of loot. Australia leads even the
China Coasl ports. Adelaide, the smallest
thief of the lot, takes only 1.7 d. in the £.
and Melbourne but 2.2 d. Shanghai .and
Hongkong, with 2.3c1. and 3.3 d. respectively,
seem to be the only foreign ports approxi-
mating to our standard of thievery. Sydney
outdistances it with a bite-off of 4.8 d. in the
£, and Brisbane is in a class by itself with
a “pinch” of 15.9 d. One might cavil at
these figures were they not so strongly en-
dorsed by the findings of the Federal
Royal Commission in 1921. That body
found that pillage losses in Australia for
1920 were: Melbourne, overseas, £95,000,
inter-State, £6500; Adelaide, £15,760 and
£3700; Sydney, £162,600 and £18,500; Bris-
bane, £29,000 and £27.000. Perth and Hobart
figures are proportionate.
No one with a first-hand knowledge of
water-front conditions can honestly deny
that 90 per cent, of the pillaging is the
work of the wharf-laborer. It is not that he
is. in the mass, criminal. Tl\e spirit is that
which informed the A.I.F. in the matter
of “souveniring”—it is the custom of the
trade and a venial sin, if one at all. The
taker of such trifles as silk stockings, boots,
coats and similar oddments for the benefit
of himself and his acquaintance is apt to
look on himself as an ill-used person on the
rare occasions on which he may have to
face a charge. The attitude towards serious
theft by a body of men as honest in most
respects as any other in the community is
largely helped by the attitude of the lower
courts, which deal with most cargo pilfering
cases. The magistrates seem to regard pil-
laging in the same amiable light as shop-
lifting. It is rare for a sentence of im-
prisonment to be inflicted without the
option of a fine. These last, even when not
trivial, are paid in a few hours by a whip-
round among the “mob,” a collection to
which few dare refuse to contribute. The
politician is even more supine than the
Courts, and with the Labor variety the very
notion of interfering with the vested rights
of the powerful wharf-laborers’ organisation
is a nightmare.
The only remedy in sight seems to be the
tightening up of the law. That has been
done in N.S.W. with regard to assaults on
the police and has had a most salutary
effect. Supervision in the holds might do
good if it were practicable. But when it
has been attempted it has been fiercely re-
sented by the very people who should wel-
come it.
Soldier Settlement Elsewhere.
Britain has had very little better success
than Australia in its attempt to settle re-
turned soldiers on the land. Under the
Land Settlement (Facilities) Act of 1919
the Government made a loan of 20 millions
to the Counties’ Settlement Fund. There
was an initial rush of applications, but out
of 49,000 candidates 22,000 were rejected
or did not go on, which indicates that
some care was taken in the selection. By
the end of 1924 only 16,000 of the remain-
ing applicants had been “settled,” most of
them in the early rush; but up to the
middle of 1926 not a penny had been re-
ceived in repayment of the 15 millions
actually expended by the British Govern-
ment. It had cost an average of £1340 per
settler to do the job, but some of the
money was supplied from subsidiary funds,
or was supplied by the settlers, who were
expected to put in a small sum of money
and mostly bought their own equipment,
which averaged £3OO. Only 250 of the
settlers agreed to pay an extra 14 per cent,
a year in order to become owners of their
land; the rest were satisfied with leaseholds.
In 1923 it was found necessary to revise the
rentals, which were in some cases cut down
50 per cent.; but although only 2 per cent,
interest is asked, the interest debts are
growing and the proposal has been made
that the State shall cancel half the counties’
indebtedness. Up to the end of 1924 no
less than 4061 settlers had given up their
holdings, and 12 per cent, of the balance
were judged to be definite failures.
The scheme of Empire settlement has
not shown any brilliant results either in
Canada, wffiich agreed in 1924 to the terms
of the Empire Settlement Act, 1922.
Although 1504 families were settled by the
end of 1925. 2.3 per cent, had already given
up their farms and 2.6 per cent, had given
notice that they were intending to do so,
whilst another 5 per cent, were ranked as
failures. The settlers in Canada were ex-
pected to provide £75 themselves, and the
cost of settlement was limited to £1500;
and a maintenance allowance in the form of
wages for forest-clearing and land-improve-
ment is granted. The scheme provided that
every settler should have good agricultural
experience; but even that, coupled with
the maintenance allowance, did not prevent
failures.
With such examples of the difficulty else-
where of making new farmers, the collapse
of the Australian settlement schemes into
which the Australian Governments merely
floundered is not surprising.
The Moving-picture Monopoly.
The Commonwealth Film Commission,
which began as a Select Committee —its
powers were increased because a member of
the movie plutocracy refused to answer
pertinent questions—has completed the tak-
ing of evidence and is presumably at work
on its report. In the course of its investi-
gations it visited every State. It could
have got all the information it needed in
Sydney, Melbourne and a few country
towns, for the conditions existing in Vic.
and N. S. Wales are repeated in the other
States and the witnesses examined in those
parts covered the same ground. But the
unnecessary travelling will be forgiven, as
also will the excessive loquacity of some
Commissioners, if the report leads to the
production of Australian moving-pictures
on a large scale. And to suggest practicable
ways and means of establishing a film in-
dustry is the most important part of the
Commission’s job.
As regards climate, scenery, history and
interesting types of humanity, comely
young females especially, Australia is admir-
ably adapted for moving-picture produc-
tion, and many Australians have shown a
marked talent for it, in their own country
and another. The home market, moreover,
is one of the best in the world, while there
is every reason for believing that good Aus-
tralian films would always find a welcome
in Britain, Maoriland, S’Africa, India and
other parts of the Empire, if not in foreign
countries. Yet the fact remains that 98 p.c.
of the photo-plays exhibited in Australia
are of American manufacture; and the
Chief Censor has testified that many of
them are contemptible except on the mech-
anical side, being essentially vulgar and
vulgarising.
How did this foreign monopoly come
about? In the first place, because films
can be dumped on the Australian market
as no other commodity can. Suppose an
Australian company with no financial
interest in theatres decides to make a “fea-
ture film” at a cost of £SOOO. It has to
spend the whole £SOOO before it is in a posi-
tion to sell a “positive”—that is, a copy
ready for exhibition. But an American co.
which has made a £SOOO feature film, and
has had the run of its own market already,
can strike off a positive and send it to Aus-
tralia for £2OO or £3OO, all told. The Cus-
toms duty is only lid. a foot, and this on
a six-reel production amounts to a mere
£37 10s.
Then the theatres are so controlled that
it is impossible for the Australian co. to
get its picture shown —unless it hires out-
of-the-way halls on its own account—except
as a favor. The city and suburban theatres
are, with few exceptions, run by two con-
cerns which have “arrangements” with the
Americans. The representative of one
admitted to the Commissioners that he had
rejected Australian films because he had so
much American stuff on hand and that he
had recently signed a three years’ contract
with a Yankee combine. As for country
showmen, they are tied up in such a way
that if they screen a decent Australian film
in place of a rotten thing from Hollywood,
they have to pay for the rotten thing from
Hollywood. Thus are the dice loaded
against the Australian producer in his own
country.
The Commission was assured by rich im-
porters that Protection would not help the
Australian producer at all, and the chair-
man said there was no evidence that it
would. He spoke too soon, for Professor
Wallace, called in his capacity as Chief
Censor, emphatically declared that it was
an obvious case for Protection—that and a
rejection clause in contracts. The Professor
was the most interesting of the scores of
witnesses examined and one of the few
with no axe to grind. His main recommen-
dation is the result of unique personal
study and is in line with Australian experi-
ence. If there is any better device than
Protection for building up a necessary in-
dustry—and picture-production is a neces-
sary industry—this country has yet to hear
of it.

The Antiquity of Modern Cures.
“E. M. Pyric”: Certain newspapers have
recently spread themselves on the subject
of the marvellous cure of syphilis in its
nervous forms by artificially-produced
malaria. The patient is injected intra-
venously with malaria blood, and (for what
reason medical science knows not) his con-
dition improves. ' The discovery was made
some seven years ago by Austrian doctors,
but the earlier reports read so much like
mediaeval medicine they were not taken
very seriously. Brain syphilis is, however,
a very serious condition, and so difficult of
cure that any treatment seems worthy of
consideration and trial.
The treatment of nervous disease by
quartern fever is in very fact mediaeval.
The discovery was attributed by Middle-
Age physicians to Hippocrates. We have a
record of Louis XI. writing to the Prior of
Notre Dame de Salles, at Bruges, asking
the latter to “pray for me to God and
Our Lady of Salles that they may be
pleased to send me a quartern fever, for I
have a disease that the physicians say
cannot be cured without it.” Voltaire
derided both the king and his medical ad-
visers for their belief in the cure, but
modern observation supports them. Ben-
venuto Cellini also had quartern fever
and later “the French disease,” as the
Italians called syphilis, after a French mili-
tary expedition had disseminated it
throughout their country. Although Cel-
lini's disease was probably a severe secon-
dary attack, he did not suffer greatly from
after-effects. Can this have been due to
the malaria or to the arsenic he ingested
when in his middle age an unsuccessful
attempt was made to poison him? Certainly
we have his own words that he felt better
once he got over the colic occasioned by
the poison.
The medieval physicians were not very
scientific, as we now understand science,
but they used some of their drugs with
good effect, and appear to have been very
observant of some of the effects of disease.
There is. indeed, little that is really new in
medicine. When we consider the present-
day vogue for gland extracts, etc., in the
light of our ancestors’ partiality for obscure
and obscene fragments of reptiles and mam-
mals, we cannot help wondering whether
they knew more or we know less than we
generallv assume.

The Commonwealth’s Railways.
Dear Bulletin, — “Only one railway in Aus-
tralia. the Commonwealth Trans-Australian,
has been able to show consistently im-
proved finances during the past few years,
and this notwithstanding that it runs
through a sparsely populated territory” (B.
4/8/’27). The concern alluded to is, of
course, the Western line, which hugs the
coast so persistently that it takes a risk
of drowning in Spencer’s Gulf. The figures
to June, 1925, show this: —
Federal Railways.
Northern
Pt. Augusta- Oodna- Terri-
Kalgoorlie. datta. tory.
Interest charged .. 1920 £222,352 £80,048 £61,215
„ ..1925 108,044 85,596 78,828
Net loss shown .. 1920 264,992 117,530 82,742
„ . . 1925 145,560 133,349 83,664
The interest charged against the petted
Western line having been cut down by more
than one half, though the capital invested
increased during the period, it is possible
to represent it as a rapidly improving pro-
perty. Wherefore Westralians say that the
work is justifying itself, and that a similar
Federal East-West railway in Northern
Westralia wouldn’t be a bad thing. No simi-
lar kindly act or fake having been done to
improve the financial appearance of the
two isolated and unfinished sections of the
South-to-North railway, which is urgently
wanted to develop a great Federal pro-
perty and to populate the North, the
real Transcontinental remains the same
object of scorn, and Queensland wire-pullers
quote it as evidence that the only Federal
line which deserves consideration is one
through their western sand patch. So far
as I can see, the East-West show looks
£119,432 better because £114,308 has been
taken off the interest bill, while the South-
North (Pt, Augusta-Oodnadatta-Katherine-
Darwin) one looks £16,731 worse because
£23,161 has been added. —Yours, Bildad.

The High Cost of Irrigation.
George Swinburne, who is a Victorian ex-
Minister, an irrigation expert, and has been
part-and-parcel of more big undertakings
than 99| per cent, of his fellow-men, has
come back from inspecting Central Aus-
tralia. His report is -that it is a good land,
very similar to the veldt on which the
Boer makes his money, and full of possi-
bilities if the owner’s agent would only
take a serious interest in it and sink more
wells. The miserable 55,635 ft. of artesian
and sub-artesian bore-sinking in the Terri-
tory compares very poorly with the
3,755,597 ft. in Queensland alongside. But
agent Bruce is, as usual, pottering around
the old mouse-hole down in the south-east,
where there are State Governments to look
after things and where the Commonwealth
possesses no land worth speaking of, and is
spending a few millions on making the
Hume Reservoir. It is doubtless a noble
and monumental undertaking, but some-
thing costing very much less might make
a much greater area of the Commonwealth’s
own estate habitable and valuable, whereas
the Murray valley is inhabited and very
high-priced already. Irrigation is accepted
in a stereotyped fashion as a source of
wealth, but irrigation works built with
high-priced labor and high-priced loan
money (especially the foreign variety),
and with the irrigated farms a long
way from a market, may prove dis-
appointing. The Murrumbidgee irrigation
area, including the townlets of Leeton.
Griffith, Yanco and Yenda, is a proud insti-
tution. It grew in 1924-25 £720,000 worth of
agricultural and pastoral produce on an irri-
gated area of 61,548 acres, for it isn’t a
large affair though it has cost nine millions
or so. That was something over £ll worth
of produce per acre. But the taxpayer had
to cover a loss of £285,259, or over £4 per
acre, incurred in the process. The total
losses for 10 years are set down at over
£2,700.000, interest, largely due to persons
abroad, being responsible. It looks possible
for Australia to do something a good deal
better.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Two final straws helped to strain the back
of the Queensland railways camel. The
last increase of charges has resulted, it is
said, in a decrease of revenue, and the new
claims for the Arbitration Court to deal with
are a formidable list. Among other signs
of the times there has been talk of closing
the Normanton-Croydon railway, an isolated
misfortune 96 miles long, whereon the expen-
diture is three times greater than the earn-
ings. The Almaden-Forsayth line, 142 miles
long, was abandoned after the floods as not
worth repair, and the Cooktown line of 68
miles may also go. Its outgoings are over
four times its income.
Saying that the child-endowment tax
“forced through Caucus b’ 7 Mr. Lang” is
“partly ruining industry,” Minalian, Labor
M.L.A. for Sydney, has flung his glove in the
Premier’s face and will fight him in the
Auburn electorate. Minahan is a boot-
manufacturer, and the child-endowment tax
is costing him a tidy sum, though few of his
employees benefit. Incidentally, “Good old
Piddo,” author of the great scheme, escapes
the impost, though he gets £3500 p.a. The
owner of a factory paying £3500 p.a. in
wages, to perhaps 15 hands, has to shell out
£lO5, and another £122 10s. will be exr
tracted from him if Lang has his way.
Vic. Parliament has been told by the leader
of each House —Hogan in the Assembly and
Jones in the Council —that the Labor
Cabinet has not considered the reinstate-
ment of the police strikers of November,
JOHN VERRAN, ex-Labor Premier of
South Aus., on his way to the Senate,
vice BARWELL, who has accepted the
job of Agent-General for his State.
1923. Hogan and Jones were clearly trying
to save the face of Chief Sec. Prendergast,
who controls the Police Department, but they
were not successful. For nearly three months
Prendergast has been trying to create a
Cabinet atmosphere favorable to the re-em-
ployment of the strikers. At every meeting
the temperature grows colder. Hogan has
the right to reshuffle portfolios without con-
sulting Caucus —that body does not elect a
Minister to any particular office. Exercise of
this right might save a lot of trouble.
There are two things to be learned by
Nationalists from the latest insurrection on
the Queensland railways. One is that so-
called Qovernment ownership of railways and
tramways places a dangerous power in the
hands of Red fools like Rymer and Moroney.
The other is that private ownership of
motor-cars, ’buses and lorries is a check on
that power and can be so developed and
organised as to defeat it. So, if Nationalists
are capable of learning anything apart from
ways of catching votes, they should resist
all efforts to drive privately-owned motor-
’buses and lorries off the roads. That sort
of “socialisation” will assuredly be attempted
by the Red fools and their submissive Langs.
South Australia is coming to depend more
and more on wine production. For the year
ending June 30 the output was 16,159,505
gallons, an increase of over three million
gallons for the twelvemonth. The quality is
high, and exports are increasing. In fact,
the progress of the wine industry is another
bright spot on the horizon.
Industrious Commissioner Piddington gave
his rural basic-wage decision without hear-
ing any evidence. Newspaper and other
comments filled him with a sense of wrong,
so oh his demand a Royal Commission has
been appointed —
two judicial gentle-
men and a K.C. —
to inquire. What
it is to inquire into
isn’t very clear, but
it proposes to sit
from Monday to
Friday each week
till the matter is
finished, so it is
evidently a massive
business.
Professor PEDEN,
K.C., M.L.C., of
Sydney U ni., Chair-
man of the Royal
Commission of
Inquiry into the
Federal Consti-
tution and its
defects, which is
to kick off at
Canberra next
week.
If N.S.W. has a Nationalist Government
after the elections it is promised that the
Sydney City Council will be suspended and
the Ma State metropolis put under the con-
trol of commissioners, as happened in 1853.
There will also, it is assumed, be a stringent
inquiry into past history. The Council has
become a heavy load for a Labor Government
to carry, and despite all its efforts it hasn’t
contrived yet to purchase its long-sought coal-
mine. Incidentally the Balmain colliery at
which the Council nibbled (purchase price,
£310,000) had a mention the other day, the
£1 shares being offered at ss. If the lot
could be sold on these terms the price of the
whole show would be £66,125.
Imports of U.S. films were valued for
Customs purposes at £220,700 in the last
recorded year and £184,400 the year before.
Yet the representative of one group of
theatres told the Royal Commission that his
concern alone paid £200,000 p.a. in film hire,
and that the Australian tribute to Holly-
wood was at least four times that amount.
The few Australian pictures made this year
have found employment for hundreds. The
hundreds would increase to thousands were
there really Protective duties, with conces-
sions to others parts of the Empire to secure
markets there. One would imagine this con-
sideration would appeal to the trade-union
leaders, but there has been chilling indif-
ference in that quarter where there hasn’t
becen actual hostility.
Works Minister Hill, who shovels out the
Federal-aid road money, refuses to believe
that bands of Sydney unemployed, all Labor-
unionists, have been hurried into shaky State
electorates and planted on Federal-aid roads
in time to secure electoral transfers. Earlier
in the year the confiding old gentleman was
incredulous of similar reports from West-
ralia, although vouched for by fellow-
Cockies. Then he had to confess that he had
misinformed the House, and that “2500
laborers are being employed on works without
my approval.” Hill evidently has a poor
memory, as well as a foolish faith in siip-
perv State politicians.
Tas. Parliament was asked by Premier
Lyons to consider the question of a rise in.
salaries, as the present screw
(£300) was hardly a living wage. The
Opposition, scenting a chance to make the
Lyons Government , look like salary-grabbers
ot the deepest dye in the eyes of next year’s
electors objected, and Lyons astutely re-
ferred the subject to a joint committee of
both Houses. In the result, barring acci-
dents, there will be increases of £7O for
Hobart members and up to £2OO, according
to distance, for men from the country;
and it is a commonsense differentiation.
Judge Beeby’s Arbitration Court climbed
down, as was generally expected it would,
in the metal-trades dispute. After all, the
ground is the safest place. A Beeby award
had authorised daily instead of weekly hiring,
but strikes promptly arose in various estab-
lishments, and the Court gave way at once.
It covered its retreat with a cloud of vague
reproaches against the employers for not
having introduced the 44-hours week with
48-hours pay “without waiting until separ-
ate orders had been issued by the Court,”
and claimed that some of them had
“flaunted” their alleged victory. Employees
when they win a victory in the Arbitration
Court may give three cheers if they like;
but employers, it seems, mustn’t claim a
victory, even if they think they have gained
one. Why? Isn’t the Court supposed to
ever allow the employers to win?
By dint of collecting the income-tax to the
last penny before the close of the financial
year the Slang Government made a surplus;
but having squeezed the orange dry, it has in
the first two months of the year had a deficit
of £1,443,000. The figures show what an
impudent financial fakir the Slang Govern-
ment is.
Some people iu England reckon that the
U'. Kingdom will have little or no spare
money to put into new external loans for a
very long time. The surplus of exports to
be paid for is so vast that it appears more
than capable of swallowing J. Bull’s income
from foreign investments and the external
carrying trade. Vigorous Protection might
improve the balance of trade, but vigorous
Protection is long in coming. It mightn’t
hurt the Old Man much to go out of
the money-lending business for a time,
but it might be a very serious thing for Aus-
tralia if it had to throw itself entirely on
the capacious bosom of Uncle Sam for its
stupendous masses of accommodation. That
bosom hasn’t had time to get properly
acquainted with us yet.
Among the visions which are to material-
ise in N.S.W. if Slang comes back is the
putting of £lOO,OOO on the loan estimates, if
loans are still procurable, as an instalment
of £1,352,000, wherewith to build “a huge
dam” at Wyangala, on the Lachlan. It is
“to serve settlers along 800 miles of the
Lachlan,” to enable 850 new settlers to settle,
and to enhance the value of 1,250,000 acres of
Crown lands. The scheme was under discus-
sion in a languid way when the Storey-Dooley-
Lang Ministry held office in 1920-22, so its
recrudescence* is sudden. How much dam
can be bought for £1,352,000, let alone for
£lOO,OOO, is a problem. Two years ago there
was nearly £9,000,000 invested in the Mur-
rumbidgee irrigation scheme, though more
has been spent since, and the space actu-
ally watered was still only about 60,000 acres-
The amount of the year’s loss w T as enough to
buy 60,000 acres of fair country.
London Ttmes reports that a Red Russian
army is doing a “trial mobilisation” close up
to Petrograd. That is unpleasantly close
to four small neighbors who live in a per-
petual state of jumps by reason of Garden’s
friends across the border line. Polite nations
generally do their spectacular manoeuvres
some distance away from the frontier, but
the Bolsheviks lack grace and refinement.
It is assumed that when the Communist
bosses passed the word for the whole inter-
national gang to get suddenly wild over the
approaching execution of Sacco and Vanzetti,
after being quiescent during the six or seven
years that the two homicides were under
sentence, the object was to test the strength
of the movement. It was something like
taking a census, and at the same time giving
a signal for revolt, and there was a chance
that the magazine would blow up some-
where. One result is that various countries
are expelling their imported undesirables by
thousands, and as this is the one land which
thinks it has no power to expel imported
undesirables many are likely to sneak in
here. It might serve a good purpose if
there was a Federal law, with Federal gaols
attached, to deal stringently with red-flaggers
and preachers of revolution, and the sentence
automatically increased 100 per cent, for
offenders of non-Australian origin. Then
they might be offered a suspension of sen-
tence provided they left for home, with an
assurance that it would be still in working
order should they return.
The cost of workmen’s insurance, of child
endowment and of the 44-hour week have
eaten up the margin of profit in a way that
Lang and other precipitate city products
made no allowance for. In the single item
of coal, the B. H. Prop, found that the im-
pulsive benevolence of people who were hand-
ing out other people’s money lately added
£lOO,OOO per annum to the expenses. And
that was merely an indirect loss caused by
the invariable habit of passing the charges
on, wdierever possible. But at the end of
the chain there is someone who can’t pass
it on; and there is a stoppage.
Victoria is appointing a committee to look
into the dairying industry, which is described
as a slave business only made possible by
the exploitation of unpaid woman and child
labor. The same description applies in
N.S.W., and unless the headlong Pidding-
ton’s basic rural wage is dodged wholesale
the Cornstalk cow is going to be a diminished
animal. A considerable part of the trade
depends on export, mostly to Britain, and
that tends to fix the price. Denmark, Hol-
land and Ireland furnish J. Bull with cow,
hen and pig products on a scale which puts
Australia wholly in the shade. Their farmers
have to pay for no land carriage worth speak-
ing of, and for only a few hours’ sea car-
riage, so they grow rich in prices which
leave the Australian producer poor. Even
more remote Maoriland beats the Common-
wealth in the British butter and cheese
market, but it saves land freight by using
16 separate ports for overseas trade. A
great Australian need is for more manu-
facturing towns, so that customers won’t be
so ridiculously far away.
It may not be a bad thing if the Muscovite
prophecy of war with Britain comes true.
There is little prospect of tranquillity or dis-
armament while the size of the murky and
mysterious “Republic’s” w r ar preparations
keeps the world guessing, and while it avows
a mission to Sovietise the world and posi-
tively refuses to cease from troubling and
sticking a finger in every pie, including pies
as far away as Sydney. It is quite possible
that; Britain would find plenty of allies if
the Sovieteers began hostilities, and it is
also quite possible that the big and garishly-
painted political edifice which Lenin ran up
would crack to pieces very cheaply. It being
possible to fly from the coast to Moscow in
an hour or two and drop bombs on the Krem-
lin, the position may be said to have changed
since Napoleon’s time.
When the Sydney City Council employees
who left off work to procesh because two
Italians had been executed in Massachu-
setts returned to their jobs next day they
divided into two classes. About 140 explained
politely the very poor reason of their absence
and resumed duty. The rest resented the
“degradation” of explaining anything and
went on strike. They were afterwards per-
mitted to resume without explanation.
Forthwith some of them held a meeting to
consider what should be done in hatred,
malice, uncharitableness and victimisation to
the men who joined in the procession but not
in the subsequent disagreeableness. Freedom
isn’t all it is cracked up to be.
The Maoriland railways, despite heroic
efforts to make them pay, continue to be
a burden on the Consolidated Fund. For the
latest financial year there is an apparent
surplus of a million and a half; but out
of that interest has to be paid on a capital

cost of about £54,000,000, and provision must
be made for depreciation and renewals. A
substantial subsidy—£44s,ooo last year —to
help branch lines and isolated sections makes
the figures better from a book-keeping stand-
point. but actually there is a deficit of nearly
half a million, computing interest at the
“policy rate” of 3f>pe’- cent. The money-

mainly because he was a pal of the head
electrician. The mine being a “safe” one. we
wore small tin lamps, shaped like coffee-pots,

down to inspect the racing picks, when the
spout of liis lamp brushed against the live

“Strict Yeg.”: Pedestrians in Collins-

stopped to watch a forlorn-looking girl in
a ragged skirt and stockings that were
mostly ladders trying to earn a living as a
pavement artist, and one or two of them
interestedly noted that her work was con-

Rubens. And so it should have been.
She was a National Gallery student out for

Actually the lady’s
name isn’t a real

name, and means

nated from Batavia.
She is supposed to
have lured amorous
Frenchmen to her

a Javanese nauteh-

“Harold Hardupp” ; The Greek community
of Sydney is torn by some sort of religious
schism, and now a Chinese faction-fight is
imminent, too. The Kuo-Min-Tang (Aus-
tralian Chinese Nationalist party) car-
ried a resolution transferring its allegi-
ance to General Chiang-Kai-Shek, who re-
cently established the Nanking Government,

“Never mind, dear —she can’t stop you from going to her divorce.”
executed some of his old friends and expelled
the Communists. But there was a minority
in the K.-M.-T. which dissented vigorously
from the resolution; these, led by one San
Wong, support the Hankow Government and
regard Chiang as a traitor; and the majority,
led by Lee Wing, declare Wong’s followers
to be the Chinese equivalent of Red-Raggers.
There is to be a legal fight over the books
and funds; in the meantime if any Aus-
tralian should bump into a mob of com-
batants fighting with chopsticks he will
know what it is all about.
“Strict Veg.”: Many years ago The Bul-
letin printed a cartoon depicting that be-
whiskered old prophet, General Booth, as
an immigration agent emptying the halt, the
sick and the destitute into Australia. Things
have changed since. The Salv’army’s newest
venture is to charter an entire ship, the
Vedic, and fill her with 700 selected
migrants. Most of them are young farm-
hands or Scotch domestics, and all have been
passed by Australia House. Their way out
will be enlivened with lashings of soft drinks,
band music, classes and lectures on useful
subjects and plenty of prayer meetings. Jobs
will be available within 48 hours of landing,
and the Army shoulders the responsibility
of them for three years. The only parts of
the ship that won’t be under the command of
the red sweater will be the engine-room and
the bridge.

“Bouragi” : It is interesting to read that
feminine Paris is enthusiastically adopting
a new fashion in ear ornaments, to be known
as ear-rims. These are small jewels, or
similar adornments, inserted in holes round
the outer rim of the ear, and, like most
feminine fads, have been imitated from the
primitive savage. Papua is, or was, particu-
larly given to these vanities, the fashion,
however, being confined to the males, who
had a greater flair for personal decoration
than they would permit their ladies to ex-,
hibit. A beau of the old days, with half a
dozen dog or crocodile teeth radiating, from
the periphery of each ear, was irresistible
among the flappers. The trouble which
civilised imitators of this savage inode lay
up for themselves is that, when the craze
goes out of fashion, the holes remain. A
young person with her ear-lobes pierced may
be borne with, but one with her ear circum-
ference resembling nothing so much as the
edge of a penny stamp may find herself re-
garded coldly by a world that has turned to
newer insanities.

“Carisbrook, Jun.”: I, too, recall a stew-
ard, fresh to the game, who had an infal-
lible cure for sea-sickness (I>. 8/8/'27).
The tourist steamer had just left Sydney
for Cairns, when a lady, very white about
the gills, appealed to him for something to
relieve her distress. “Righto, Missus!" he
assured her, “I’ve just the thing for you.
Never been known ter fail, either,” and he
disappeared below, to return with a bottle
of some slimy mixture. The passenger took
a liberal dose, turned in, and to her delight
woke up next morning feeling tip-top. With
gratitude in her eyes, and her hand in her
purse, she strolled off to find her benefactor.
He wasn’t discernible, so she inquired his
whereabouts from another steward. “Joe?”
was the reply. “ ’E’s in ’is bunk, fair down
to it!” v
“Larrapinta”: The mate of the Swedish
windjammer had asked me to go fishing with
him in one of the ship’s lifeboats. While we
were casting off some of the crew of a French
cargo-boat returned to their ship with a
catch consisting almost entirely of squid and
octopus. They seemed in high spirits, and
I asked the Swede what they would do with
their take. “Eat dem,” he assured me.
“Frenchies eats anything dot swims, crawls
or flies. But dey aren’t so bad as der people
of Iceland. I’ve seen dem fill a barrel mil.
codfish-heads and milk and den leave it.
When it lifts der lid off dey reckon it’s fit
to eat. And in der Faroe Islands I’ve seen
der people bury meat until dey vant it—
sometimes dey don’t vant it for a month.”

“Kayeff” : Feeling in a vanished limb can
be real enough. In a Rouen hospital I was
for a time the only walking patient in a
ward of arm- and leg-wound cases, and had
numerous odd jobs to do for the laid-up in-
mates. One day a painfully emaciated 1914
man, who was just getting over a bout oi
pneumonia, called me over. “Scratch my
foot, w r ill you, Dig?” he asked. “Which
one?” “The right one, down by the toes.”
I was new to the ward, but the start I gave
when I saw that both legs had been ampu-
tated at the knee fortunately passed un-
noticed, and I pretended to comply with his
request. The sister told me later that she
had been doing the same thing for several
days; the man’s legs had been amputated
while he was delirious with fever, and t : °
doctors had forbidden them to tell him until
he got stronger.
THE POET'S PRAYER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I feel no overpowering urge, no frantic
T )esire to know who will be next to soar
Triumphantly across the wide Atlantic,
Or swim the tricky Channel, shore to shore.
Wireless I reckon an infernal bore
That gives its votaries beetles in the napper.
But week by week I wonder more and
more
How many summers must elapse before
We hit upon a variant for “flapper.”
Was ever, do you think, such load gigantic
Of labor, such a constant stress and sore,
Laid on a single word since quaint and antic
"Bloke” lobbed into our English repertoire?
Doubtless it’s added to our verbal store
And filled a vacuum, as a bell the clapper.
But where’s the peachlike bloom that once
it wore
And where the piquancy? Let me implore
Someone to find a synonym for “flapper.”
A "damozel” mayhap is too romantic;
A “skirt” is vulgar Cockney to the core;
A “jane” (small j) sounds sort of cory-
bantic;
And one might ring the changes on a score
Of terms it's necessary to ignore
Since dainty goods demand a fitting wrapper;
Can't controversialists cease their roar
And philologie avenues explore
To find a snappy substitute for “flapper”?
Little I care if Lang’s career is o'er,
Or whether Dempsey write in Tunney’s gore
Ilis rehabilitation as a scrapper.
But there are words the doggerel bard that
floor
(Of makeshift rhymes I’ve happed on barely
four).
Please, someone, frame a synonym for
“flapper”!

“Elgar”: Before Judge Wasley, of
Victoria, to meet a charge of bigamy,
came an ex-Digger, whose first wife
had got a decree nisi in 1916, but
hadn’t had it made absolute till ’26.
In the meantime the semi-detached
hubby had married again. He pleaded
that he thought he was doing no
wrong in taking another consort after
the decree nisi, but 'Sonah assured
him that if he had no better excuse
he would do well to “throw himself on
the mercy of the Court.” The biga-
mist having intimated his readiness to
do so, the Judge inquired if he still
wished to marry the second lady. Too
right, he did ! The lady, being asked,
proved equally agreeable, and a some-
what relevant and curiously intriguing
interjection having been contributed by
somebody to the effect that the accused
man’s first wife had sworn that what-
ever else he wasn’t he was always
the perfect gentleman, ’Sonah bound
over the transgressor to come back in
three days’ time with liis marriage-
lines. The little drama could hardly
have ended more happily on the stage.

“A. Jack”: Few think of Broken
Hill as a health resort, but D. 11.
Wallace, the town’s chief health in-
spector, a much-travelled man, re-
cently urged the council to boom it
as an ideal place for persons suffer-
ing from lung troubles. Three hun-
dred miles from the nearest coast and
1000 feet above sea-level, the air is
clean and fresh, with no humidity. In
the depth of winter 30 degrees is a
very uncommon minimum, 55 and over
the usual maximum, and one may rely
on 13 days of full sunshine out of 14.
Except in the very heart of the city
each house has at least one-eightli of
an acre of yard room ; in addition to
all other conveniences of city life there
is a hospital equal to anything in
Australia, and the mine engineers
know how to burn coal so that there
is no smoke nuisance. Much has been
written about the dust nuisance, but
an allowance of 12 really bad days a
year would be too high. Summer heat
certainly goes up to 110° in short
bursts, but it is a dry, healthy heat at
worst, and the nights need a poet to
describe. Possibly the time is not far
distant when Macquarie-street speci-
alists will send their patients to the
Barrier for a change, the new railway
having made it a great deal more
accessible.

“Kokopo”: For many years it has
been the custom of Papuan residents
when visiting the Commonwealth on
leave or holiday to bring native ser-
vants with them, especially as nurse-
boys, and the custom has been imi-
tated by dwellers in near-by New
Guinea. Minister for Territories Marr
has announced that an embargo is to
be placed on this practice. The idea
is that the spectacle of white civili-
sation at first hand is unedifying for
the unsophisticated savage, and that
lie is apt to return to his native land
with his respect for white authority
somewhat dimmed. It seems a trifle
far-fetched. The darky has ample
opportunities on his native heath to
observe the shortcomings of the
superior race, and his extensive know-
ledge is unlikely to be added to by
anything he may see in Australia. On
the other hand this veto threatens to
prove a real hardship to the long-
suffering white woman of the Terri-
tories and her usually young family.
The help of a good “boy” with the
youngsters usually added materially to the
enjoyment of the brief southern trip. In
future the visiting sinabada will have to put
in her vacation as her own nursemaid.

“G.R.L. : Here is another forgotten
tragedy of Torres Strait. In 1836 Captain
Lewis brought to Sydney 45 skulls found at
Aureed Island. Seventeen of them were pro-
nounced to be European, and it was gen-
erally accepted that they were grim relics of
the wreck of the barque Charles Eaton,
near the Sir Charles Hardy Islands, two
years before. I believe they 'were all buried
in one of the Sydney cemeteries. There were
31 souls on the wrecked ship; five of them
reached Timor Laut (now Yamdena) in the
only serviceable boat, and made their way
to Batavia 12 months later, whence news
of the wreck drifted back to Svdney. Cap-
tain Lewis was sent in the Isabella to look
for survivors. He found two on Murray
Island, in addition to the skulls on Aureed
Island. One was John Ireland, steward's
boy of the lost vessel; the other was a two-
year-old toddler named William D’Oyley,
who was being looked after by a dusky foster-
mother. The natives accepted tomahawks in
exchange for their captives. Ireland said
that all those on the wreck had been
murdered except two D’Oyley youngsters,
a youth named Sexton and himself; Sex-
ton and the elder D’Oyley boy had been
taken to another island by a different tribe
ot natives. Nothing was ever heard of these
again. Among the murdered passengers were
the parents of the two youngsters, Captain
D Oyley, of the Hon. East India Company’s
Artillery, and his wife. I have often won-
dered what became of the two survivors.

Herodot” : Chinese are not the only ones
who put marks on the front gates of houses
for the guidance of others of their kind (B.
11/S/’27). In both Sydney and Melbourne
the hawker fraternity employs a similar code.
The commonest mark is either a circle or
a rough X on the left-hand post of the gate.
The former is an intimation that a woman
is certain to be encountered in hawking
hours; the latter a warning that a man is
liable to be there.

“Roka”: A well-known M.L. member and
legal light tells the story of a waterside
worker who was giving evidence in the Arbi-
tration Court. Counsel had inquired of him
if he had been ostracised by his union, when
the Judge benevolently interposed and said
“Hullo, boys, the. Willi-
s Zoo has escaped!”
“Hear him roar!”
“Blime, Jock, somebody must ha’ told ’em it was us.”
PLAYED OUT.
"The action of Messrs. Mutch, Cann, Evatt and other members in deciding to stand as
candidates in spite of defeat at corrupt ballots has been endorsed by large bodies of Laborites
in their electorates.”
the question was unfair, as the man could
not possibly know the meaning of “ostra-
cised.’ “Pardon me, your Honor,” said the
watersider coldly, “I understand the term
perfectly. It is derived from a Greek word
meaning ‘to banish’!”

Veg.”: The other day a visitor at
the Chalet, Mount Buffalo, Victoria’s Alpine
range, lost a suitcase containing £145 out
i- , a ririgh. Before it stopped it had
slithered 2000 feet down a precipice which
had been declared unscalable by experienced
alpineers. The manager of the hostel refused
to allow any of his staff to go to the rescue,
but a local engineer named Hargreaves per-
formed the feat and brought back every-
thing but a watch. When the grateful owner
offered him 10 guineas salvage he looked sur-
prised, if not hurt.

“The Rumpus” : At the little bush church
everything was ready for the wedding of
Jim and Blinda, but at the last moment
the bride suddenly seemed to gijow marriage-
shy. She giggled hysterically, 'backed away
from her father, and when the old man
grabbed her by the arm, broke from his grip
and made for the door. By this time there
was quite a buzz of talk over the lady’s inex-
plicable behavior. Then Dad in a booming
voice took command of the situation. “Ring
round er!” lie roared at the bewildered
guests. “Ring round ’er ! She’s like our old
strawberry cow that won’t never go inter the
bail without an ’ell of a fuss!”

“Saville Row”: Nothing so convinces one
of the unshakable loyalty of the British
people to the Throne as the news that the
Prince of Wales has been photographed in a
morning coat, a soft collar and a straw hat,
without starting a revolution. Certainly the
painful incident took place in comparatively
free-and-easy Canada, not the ILK.; still,
there are bounds beyond which even princes
should fear to tread. The one bright feature
of the harrowing incident is that up to the
present that great artist, the editor of the
Tailor and Cutter, doesn’t appear to have
blown out his brains, but I am still scanning
the morning cables apprehensively.

“Blanc”: In 1916 a crowd of Diggers
on the transport Osterley, desirous of
sampling the attractions of forbidden Col-
ombo, shinned down the side on to a barge
and endeavored to pole ashore. Their luck
was rotten, and presently a perverse tide
was carrying them out to sea with a naval
pinnace in hot pursuit. When the rescuing
craft had almost overhauled the soaked run-
aways, the voice of a British officer was
heard: “What the Hell do you men think
you’re doing?” One of the delinquents threw
a penny into his eye and drawled back:
“Yachting, old bean! Yachting!”

■ “Phil P.” : In San Cristoval, British Solo-
mons, methods of contraception are as well
understood and extensively practised as in
Papua. The number of childless unions sug-
gest that the precautionary step is taken
early; young girls are treated before mar-
riage to produce sterility. The main reason
for the practice, I believe, is that in Sau
Cristoval the woman is the worker, and hence
too precious for her time to be occupied bear-
ing children. The men are notoriously indo-
lent, and it is not surprising that the whole
community is on the down grade. I could
never elicit any information regarding the
specific used beyond the cryptic “old fella
Mary he savvy.”

“Merris”: “J.C.McT.’s” camel and buffalo
combination (B. 11/8/’27) was not at all
an uncommon one in Egypt. I have also
seen a camel and donk, a donk and buffalo,
and a buffalo and a woman yoked together
to provide motive power for the ancient
wooden soil-disturber. A sight that always
annoyed the Digger was that of a fat old
Gyppo in flowing robes bestriding an ass,
while his heavily-laden missus trotted be-
hind. Complications ensued on one occasion
when an indignant Billjim ordered the Sheik
to dismount and hand over his charger to
the lady.

“Stellsby” : Prime Minister Baldwin men-
tioned in England the other day that
“hordes of children wander about the streets
of Leningrad and Moscow physically and
mentally defective and addicted to vice.”
Meanwhile the latter city appears to have
taken on some of the semblance of a Holy
City in the eyes of people who aren't
Itussian. Extract from a London paper:—
The ashes of the late Arthur McManus, of the
British Communist Party, have arrived at Moscow.
In conformity with the will of the deceased, the
urn will be buried in Moscow under the Kremlin wall.
McManus was one of the seven Reds who
were handed six months at the Old Bailey
in 1925 for seditious conspiracy.

“Medicurse”: Sydney Hospital patients
saw the first wedding in ward history the
other day. The setting was a bit out of the
common, consisting largely of Baulkham
frames, splints, plaster, extension gadgets,
wheel-chairs and so on, for the bridegroom
had a fractured thigh-bone, but the bride
managed orange-blossoms, and there was a
sky-pilot from St. Mary’s. The accident had
occurred a day or two before that fixed for
the marriage, but the young couple refused
to allow it to interfere with schedule.
“Carisbrook, Jun.”: The unattended
light on Clarke Island, scene of the
Tasman mishap, was put out not by
a moth fluttering on the pilot light
(“Sea Nomad,” B. 4/8/’27) but by the
snapping of the connecting pipe be-
tween the hydrogen cylinder and that
light. When an automatic light is
extinguished, great care has to be
taken not to venture too near with a
naked light; unforeseen things might
happen when contact is made with
the sizzling hydrogen which has been
escaping since the glim was doused.
Also, despite glazing, unattended
lighthouses are just as liable to blur-
ring as attended ones. The humidity
on the North Queensland coast quickly
frosts over the prismatic windows
with a salt glaze. Lights that ought
to have been seen at a distance have
frequently been reported extinguished
when they have been merely rendered
opaque by the action of the salt mist.

“Clerk”: Vic. Railway Commis-
sioner Clapp has obviously taken 1i.c.1.
into consideration in his newly-revised
by-laws. The idle traveller who used
to carve his initials on a carriage seat
with a mere tenner hanging over his
head is now liable to be socked for
double that amount. The penalty that
may be exacted for forgetting to buy
a ticket has been raised from £5 to
£2O. Similarly Percy waiting for
Phyllis “under the clocks” at Flinders-
street without equipping himself with
a platform ticket stands to lose £2O.
And there are the same increases all
along the line, whether the offence be
throwing a lighted match or fag out
of a carriage window or throwing
yourself into a'moving train. Finally,
tlie long - distance passenger who
pinches another's seat can be mulct in
a fiver for his lawless conduct pro-
vided the temporarily absent one has
staked his claim with a hat, suitcase,
pair of trousers or similar personal
belonging.

“Mako" : I cau recall no more in-
genious free railway trip (B.
25/8/’27) than that of a M.L. young-
ster who wanted to see a football
match in a township 12 miles distant.
He boarded the train, alleging that his
pup had jumped on, and began a
search for, the animal. As the Maori-
land trains are connected all through,
he managed to evade the guard for some
time by dropping off at the stations
and getting on at a point as far from
the ticket-man as possible. When they
did meet the youth explained the loss
of the pup, and a sympathetic guard
assisted in the search. After about 1U
miles the youthful scaler informed the
guard that the pup must have fallen
off, and alighted. lie was in good
time for the match, and the local par-
son motored him home.
“Yuiop”: The usual humdrum
nature of municipal elections was
brightened in a Vic. shire this year by
a truly Australian touch. There were
two candidates for office, and each
received the same communication from
an absentee ratepayer a week or two
before polling day. The writer men-
tioned that he had received a circular
from both and after assimilating the
same had concluded that both were
good men. Neither being known to
him personally, however, he suggested
that they toss for his two votes and
advise him of the result, when he
would send in his ballot-paper in
favor of the winner. The, two candidates
met at the municipal chambers the following
morning and solemnly spun a coin.

“Oilskin”: It takes the foreigner to “See
Australia first,” as Commissioner Clapp puts
it. Jules E. Burkart, a Swiss, who arrived in
Australia two years ago, tied his one-man
canoe up at Mildura the other day after a
riv'er trip of 1050 miles! from Wagga to Euston
via the Murrumbidgee, and thence down the
Murray to his destination. His paddling time
was six weeks.

Young man with hair en pompadour,
You stood by my verandali-post
And thought you had me upon toast,
Although you guessed my purse was poor.
You said you knew I wanted frocks
And plates and needles and a hat,
You meant to sell me this and that;
You said my husband needed socks.
And all the time you never guessed
How my subconscious dealt with you,
Nor how I felt you spoilt the view
And wondered how to kill you best.
And then you stared above my head
Right through the open door, to see
What things inside the house might be
For which you’d sell me new instead.
You said, “Your gramophone’s a dud,
You’ll need to buy another now.
If cash is scarce, I’ll show you h0w”....
I could have rolled you in the mud.
Go, ere I say, “Young man, I see
Your brains are lacking: will you try
Some books I wrote? Or will you buy
A course of manners planned by me?”

Opinions of
World Famous
Publishers
FROM THE CENTURY CO.,
NEW YORK.
The first volume, received, last year, has
already proved most useful to us, and with
our use of it our appreciation of the hook
grows. You are, indeed, to he compli-
mented on the completion of so fine a work,
mo,king available, as it does, in convenient
and most attractive form, an enormous
amount of information about Australia
-which will be of the greatest use to both
scholars and general readers throughout the
world.
FROM THE OXFORD
UNIVERSITY PRESS.
The Australian Encyclopaedia is a splen-
did work —most interesting and well pro-
duced. The manifest expenditure of muck
labor and money upon it is amply justified
by the universal service it will render.
FROM G. & C. MERRIAM COM-
PANY, SPRINGFIELD, MASS.,
U.S.A., Publishers of Genuine
Webster Dictionaries since 1843.
The editorial work on the Australian
Supplement to our International Dictionary
(now incorporated in the body of the New
International) was' a difficult task, and we
wish we could then have had access to The
Australian Encyclopaedia, in every page of
which appears evidence of accurate author-
ship, careful editing and wise selection.
FROM THE CAMBRIDGE (ENG-
LAND) UNIVERSITY PRESS.
May J offer my sincere congratulations,
as a brother publisher, on your successful
completion of so large, so difficult, and so
important a piece of work?
FROM FUNK & WAGNALLS
COMPANY, NEW YORK.
The Australian Encyclopaedia will be a
monument to your firm. For years the
world has been in need of such a work. Let
me offer you my cordial congratulations on
having supplied it. The format of your
book commends itself highly to me as a
practical bookman, and 1 have been in the
publishing business for close on f.5 years.
The type chosen could not be improved on,
the half-tones in black and white and the
colour plates are equal to anything I have
ever seen.
Hundreds of letters of appreciation have
been received from prominent Australians
and from all parts of the world. Write for

SY those most competent to judge, u The Australian Encyclopedia” has been
pronounced a standard u)orh of complete general reference upon Australia.
Within three months of publication over 8000 copies were ordered by
Australians of all grades of society, from the artisan to the University professor *
This confirms the opinion of the “Cape Times, >f which said: Facts are set out in
language so clear and vivid that the work is almost as entertaining as it is
instructive”

IMPORTANT POINTS.
ACCURACY.
Nearly two hundred of
Australia's leading
literary and scientific
men—many of whom
have achieved world-
wide fame—have helped
to build up this work.
All the contributors
have special knowledge
of the subjects on which
they write. They have
taken the utmost care
to verify all statements
by reference to the best
authorities, including
(for historical matters)
diaries, autograph let-
ters and other contem-
porary documents in
various libraries and
private collections.
ARRANGEMENT.
The articles are writ-
ten simply, and, being
alphabetically arranged,
can be looked up in a
few seconds. All simi-
lar subjects are linked
together by an efficient
system of cross refer-
ences. For the benefit
of the student or deep
reader, who may occa-
sionally require wider
information than could
reasonably be expected
of any work of general
reference, at the end of
the most important
articles a list is given
of the principal books
on the respective sub-
jects.
ILLUSTRATIONS.
Thousands of photo-
graphs of our animals,
birds, reptiles, butter-
flies, moths, insects,
fishes, trees, flowers,
plants, aborigines, etc.,
were obtained at great
expense from all parts
of Australia. Of these,
nearly 300 carefully-
selected specimens have
been reproduced in half-

extra paid for them is more
than counterbalanced by the
satisfaction secured.
The men’s boots and shoes

“Geebung” : Workmen engaged in demolish-
ing an old house at Perth recently came on a
queerly-shaped piece of plaster; they broke
it and came on a silver watch with every-
thing about it intact. Wound up, it started
ticking as merrily as if it had never been
entombed. Whilst the plaster was in process
of formation or setting, one of the workmen
must have dropped his ticker and doubtless
blamed somebody for stealing it. The watch
was found to be in perfect order and con-
dition, and about 50 years old. The building
had been erected 45 years ago.
“Rodey” : What is known as “sales appeal”
has been elevated to the dignity of a fine art
in America, and whole volumes have been
written about it, but the simplest form may
be the most effective. The little, wrinkled
old man in charge of a “sav.-and-roll” wag-
gon parked in Flinders-street (Melb.) had
hopefully observed my approach on a recent
bitter midnight. Then, seeing that I looked
like passing without sampling his wares, he
put in his run. “Hey!” he exclaimed queru-
lously. “I’ve bin waitin’ for you all night.
Ain’tcher eatin’?”
THE CONNOISSEUR.
“Vi only promised, to marry him on condition that he kept up his art.”
“What, portraiture?”
“No, not exactly. Cheques—he draws them bcautifully.”
“Tip-Stave”: A union advocate complained
bitterly in the Arbitration Court at Mel-
bourne the other day when Judge Lukin
offered him time to master the evidence that
had been submitted, and, possibly to take
the sting out of the rebuke, ’Sonah w T ent,
on to relate a personal experience. “I
remember once I appeared for a prisoner
before the Full Court.” said he, “and the
lull Court said that I had not my brief
prepared. I kept talking until I got some
command _of the case. In the meantime,
however, it was found that we were arguing
about nothing—-because the prisoner had
escaped some little time before!”

"Toan” : It would take a lot to restore my
faith in the efficacy of N.S.W. railway
"safety buttons." I was travelling from
Sydney to Taree in company wflth a friend
who had fallen asleep. As the down Grafton
Taree train passed the up one on the loop-
line near Gloucester, I noticed another
friend on it and scrambled along the foot-
boards for a word with him, leaving the door
of my carriage open. Before I could get
back my train had started off and I had
to duck into the nearest carriage. As the
train gathered way the door I had left open
began to bang and awakened my sleeping
friend, who. seeing my luggage intact, the
door swinging and myself gone, naturally
thought I had fallen or jumped out; accord-
ingly he bi'oke the safety-device glass with
his fist and worked the button vigorously
without the slightest result. At the next
stop, as I raced for my carriage. I met a
very white-faced man running for Ihe guard.
I suppose that defective device saved me
a five-quid fine.
"Coke" : The Vic. Railway authorities may
not insist, like those of N. S. Wales, that ail
railway signals should stand against a sky
background (B. 25/8/’27), but if for any
reason a Vie. driver is unable to see any
signal clearly he lias only to report it and
the defect will be remedied. There is no
railway service in the world where “safe
working" is more indefatigably aimed at.
On practically all the inner suburban
lines the "three position” system of signal-
ling—the safest, and most up-to-date known —
is in force, and it is to be further extended.
“P.R.” : Varied occupations V In a country
town not far from the Federal Capital I was
driven from the railway station in the early
morning by a Jehu whom I encountered
three hours later purveying fish he had
caught overnight. In the afternoon I attended
a funeral and found that same man officiating
as gravedigger. In the evening I dropp 'd
into a barber’s shop and the same übiquitous
person shaved me. Tenders had been called
for a new fence at the Public School (I
was the h.m.), and I presently learned that
the successful tenderer was the man of many
callings. In his spare time he was caretaker
of the School of Arts.

“Wang” : Our local garbage collector w r as
telling me of the emoluments of his pro-
fession. “There’s Christmas tips, too,” he
said. “Most of ’em gives yer cash, but some
of ’em gives yer erqui variants. An’ there's
a few all-right blokes wot comes along with
A BLIZZARD ON THE HIGHLANDS.
“Those high notes don’t, seem to come to her very easily.”
“No! An impediment in her screech, so to speak.”
the dough and a bit of a present beside. I
always leave ’em a bit of a card thankin'
'em.” It was then I understood for the
first time the disconsolate expression worn
by my usually-clieerful neighbor Scanlon last
Christmastime. Scanlon won a couple of
ducks in a goose club, and a couple of nights
before Christmas arrived home with his
prizes. Pending their execution, he care-
fully placed the birds, with their legs tied
together, in the shed which houses the
household garbage tin. Feeling in a generous
mood over his win, and recalling that it was
the garbage man’s last call before Christmas,
lie also placed five bob on top of the gar-
bage tin. Next morning, when Scanlon
arrived with his tomahawk, he found his
ducks had disappeared. So much I knew,
but it hadn’t previously occurred to me that
ho had found atop of the empty tin a printed
bit of pasteboard thanking him, with a
certain studied ambiguity, for the Christmas
box.

“X.D.”: A youth filled with a burning
desire to impersonate the constabulary struck
misfortune early in Melbourne. He dragged
a man out of his house and ordered him to
put out the lights on his motor-car. The
next moment he found himself in the car
being driven to the nearest police station.
The subject of his first experiment turned
out to be a real policeman.

“Uramao”: Never handle electric ap-
pliances when you are using head-phones con-
nected with a wireless set having an earth
return. In England an old lady lifted an
electric table-lamp while she had the head-
phones on, and was struck down. In M.L.,
a few days after this appeared in the cables,
a listener-in with a small crystal set had
his head-pliones on, and was enjoying a
concert when he reached down to adjust an
electric radiator in the fireplace. Instantly
he stiffened, with the radiator at arm’s
length, then became unconscious. A son
had sense enough to switch the current off,
else the 230 volts that struck the victim
would almost certainly have transferred him
to a realm above sound-waves.
* * * *
“Simon”: Some up-country hotelkeepers
cling desperately to the two-dining-tables
tradition, though the different-priced meals
are prepared by the one cook and served
by tli e same waitresses. I was staying
recently in a pub in a western N.S.W. town
where the first- and second-class tables were
placed side by side. There was one solitary
diner at each, and the pair were amiably
exchanging condiments and remarks regard-
less of the tariff wall between them. When
they, paid for tlieir meals I expected to see
Bung put the money in two different
pockets, to preserve the illusion to the end.
but he didn't.

“Oxmoad”: The “Clark Millions’’ case,
which was going to enrich various hopeful
people in N. S. Wales almost beyond the
dreams of avarice, became more involved
and conflicting than usual last week owing
to a cable from New York which mentioned
that the immensely opulent TJ.S. ex-Senator
didn’t die intestate at all but left his wealth
to his children. The message added that
Australian claims to any part of it were
regarded by the rightful heirs with derision.
A counterblast to this was issued on behalf
of the local claimants in the form of a state-
ment that there were two W. A. Clarks of
Butte, Montana, one William Andrews and
the other William Anderson. The latter, it
was added, left a mere six millions or so,
wdiereas the former’s treasure on earth
amounted to over a hundred millions, and a
vague assurance was given that the one who
left a will was William Anderson, in whose
affairs people in this part of the world were
in no way interested. It is barely possible
that confusion may have arisen somewhere,
but the fact remains that “Who’s’Who’’ of a
few years back schedules only one W. A.
Clark, William Andrews to wit, Montana
railway and copper king and U.S. Senator
20 years ago. lie married twice and left
two sons and four daughters.
“C.Q.” : The prevailing mania ! When one
of , Clapp's big railway ’buses smashed into
a furniture van, turning it over and crump-
ling it like paper, the comment of an
astonished rescuer, as the driver emerged
under his own steam from beneath a pyra-
mid of bashed chairs, splintered sideboards
and wrecked wardrobes, was: “Y’know, you
orter take a ticket in a sweep!”

“Ernest Osborne”: “Kayeff’s” account
(B. 18/8/’2T) of the discovery of the Ocean
Island and Nauru phosphate deposits is
wrong in slabs. Passing in and out of the
Pacific Islands Co., Ltd. office in Macquarie-
place, Sydney, Albert F. Ellis was attracted
by the curious door-check, which he was told
was fossilised wood. He disbelieved this, being
convinced that it was a rare form of phos-
phate, and analysed a fragment, chipped off
the piece, in the company’s laboratory. It
proved to be, as he thought, exceptionally
pure phosphate rock. It came from Nauru.
Ocean Island (Banaba) being of similar
appearance, investigations were made, and
these resulted in the British flag being
hoisted over the precious speck.

The younger generation lias pursued the old
policy with vigor. In the past six years net
profits have more than doubled, and paid
capital more than doubled too. Naturally
the new money has not been able to earn
forthwith at the same rate as the old; the
ratio of net earnings to average capital was
12.7 p.c. last year compared with 13.2, 15.4,
18.9 and 18.3 p.c. back to 1923. Yet the
average rate of net earnings on average capi-
tal for the past five years (15.7 p.c.) is
exactly the same as in the preceding quin-
quennium. So the 10 p.c. to shareholders,
with a little extra in the fat years, has been
a comfortable matter. To old holders the
10 p.c. is worth more; twice in the last
decade bonus scrip has been handed out and
new issues have been frequent.
Here is another view of the remarkable
growth :—-

£120,000 of reserves capitalised,
llncludcs £229,650 of reserves capitalised.
And the growth continues. Last year
£75,193 was spent on freeholds, chiefly in
extensions to the co.’s big wool stores at
Port Adelaide and Fremantle; but clients
sent in so many fleeces that more space had
to be leased at Port Adelaide. That meant
extra handling and bigger exes., so the board
decided to build still another warehouse. To
finance this and general extension share-
holders have just been offered 48,800 new
£lO shares at a premium of £2 each —that is
since the accounts closed. When the new
money is all in paid capital will be
£2,049.000 and reserves will be further fat-
tened with £97,600 of premiums. A 10 p.c.
div. will even then call for £18,163 less
than was netted last year.

During the year advances, etc. —the etc. in-
cludes goods and shares in other companies—
moved up £338,182 compared with £77,521
in the previous year. The board didn't go
outside for much of this money; it drew on
its OAvn liquids for £300,624. Yet its posi-
tion was still very strong. Depositors and
others could see 535. Bd. in more or less
liquids, including advances, for every £1 of
their money. Excluding advances there was
10s. lid. of every £1 of debt in cash and
readily realisable securities. As to pros-
pects, the early future of the wool market
looks sound, but over most of the grazing
belt in S. Aus. conditions are dry. In West-
ralia, where big developments have taken
place in the pastoral industry, the outlook
is distinctly bright. The West Darling,
where the co. is solidly entrenched, is ex-
ceptionally dry—so dry that to bring a mob
of Nocatunga cattle down to Broken Hill it
has been necessary to truck up hay and
dunip it en route. Confident in the co.’s
ability to maintain the 10 p.c. under almost
any conditions the market gives £lO or there-
abouts for the £lO shares paid to £O. At
that figure, the investor buys an immediate
return of 6 p.c. and net tangibles amount-
ing to £9 ss. lid. per share.

This co.’s profits are largely wrapped up
with the linseed market, lienee the erratic
behavior of the figures. It is so far removed
from its sources of supply—South America
and India—that forward buying and large
stocks are inevitable; and it is there that
mischief creeps in, for the price of the oil
follows pretty closely the market value of
the seed. A year ago values in the raw-
material market began to improve and the
movement continued; and as trade in the
co.’s products grew, largely because of
drought, there is a sparkle in the last line of
the table. The year’s net earnings equalled 8.2
p.c. of paid capital compared with 1.5, 5.8.
7.5 and 10 p.c. for the four preceding years.
After the prefs. had been attended to the
ords. were handed 6J p.c., making the aver-
age for the past seven years a shade under
3 p.c. p.a., and the £5654 that remained re-
duced the excess of goodwill over savings to
31.5 p.c. of capital.
Trade developments are putting the co.
on almost a new foundation. The outlook
for the linoleum industry is brighter than
it has ever been. Meggitt. Ltd., made an
offer for the Australian Linoleum Co. s
business before it was sold by the debenture-
holder last year to the Linoleum Manufac-
turing Co. of Australia, Ltd., and though
its offer, was not accepted it secured an
interest in the new co., with which Michael
Nairn and Co., the big Scottish lino, people,
are associated. Lino, is nearly one-third
linseed oil. In the stock-food department,
too, the co. has been paving the road to pro-
fits for years past by consistent efforts to
educate the man on the land to the value of
scientific stock-feeding. With the help of
branch factories in Adelaide and Melbourne
that section of the business has been ex-
panding steadily. In dry times like the
present stockowners turn to the co. in
increasing numbers—and scores of them will
remain customers after the drought has
broken. Even now the production of meal
in Australia is unequal to the demand.
Here is another view of the vear’s improve-
ment :

were reduced £7657. The net result was
that the liquid surplus (£126,577), including
stocks, was £24,191 better than the 1926
figure. But, notwithstanding improved pros-
pects, actual figures will be subject to vio-
lent movements following fluctuation in the
raw-seed market, until the Tariff Board
comes to the rescue. The prefs.—there are
20,000 firsts and an equal number of
seconds —are well secured. The cover for
the firsts was £l3 7s. Bd, in net tangibles at
May 31; after that the seconds could see
just £1 less, and the. year's net profit was
over seven times their combined div. re-
quirements. For the fully-paid ords. the
market gave 165., cum 9d. div., a few weeks
back; but recent sales have been a shade
lower. At that figure the investor buys net
tangibles amounting to 13s. lid., a return
of over 8 p.c. on a 6£ p.c. div. basis and
possibilities of something better.

and 70,000 ords. at June 30. The prefs., by
the way, carry a cumulative 7 p.c. p.a., foi-
low the ords. in any distribution above that
rate and have priority as to capital. But
there is a debenture ahead of them. Most
or the new money was in hand at the close
0 1 , accounts, and new r labor-saving
plant had been installed at the co.’s Milton
factory. One result was that last year’s
ff>o S ™ P r °fil s climbed £2202, mounting to
£•>8,002. Exes, were only £l2O heavier, so
net profit got nearly all the benefit, the ratio
to . average capital being 9.6 p.c. compared
w'lth 9.8 p.c. in the previous year. Not bad
considering that trade was duller, owing to
drought and credit restriction and bigger
demands from the tax-gatherer. But share-
holders were treated over-generously, getting
nearly 83 p.c. of the year’s net earnings. And
reserves are needed, too; there is not much
of a pron for capital in the £12.807 thus
far laid by. There may be, probably is, a
little hidden strength in freeholds; but that
is not always realisable.
Balance-sheet figures moved this way:—

ihe liquid surplus (£56 366), including
stocks, was £8598 stronger. The £6251 of
new capital and the £4489 added to the
debenture debt went into stocks and book
debts. The latter are reported to be in good
condition, t.p. sales —financed by the co.—
accounting for 76 p.c. of them.' There is
nothing to indicate the basis upon which
stocks were valued, and much depends upon
that. The immediate outlook isn’t dazzling.
On top of the existing trade depression
Queensland's present industrial upset must
have a serious effect upon business, and net
profits will suffer. Last year’s net earnings
were 4J times the minimum pref. require-
ments, and net tangibles amounted to
£3 15s. 2d. per pref. share. After that the
ords. could see 235. Bd. for every £1 of
their capital. On the market buyers se*>k
the prefs. at 21s. 6d.. but offer only 18s.

The protection which the war afforded
and which the politicians had failed to
give provided the A.K.M. with an oppor-
tunity to win a market. Even during the
subsequent importing boom the co. was able
to win good returns. In fact, so satisfactory
was the position that the directors decided
to reconstruct in 1921, and four new T shares
were handed out for every three previously
held. Then early in 1924 part of the plant
was destroyed by fire; the result was a
precipitous drop of £52,038 in gross profits.
The recovery has been rapid:—

Net profit per table. . £75,207 £64,981 £79,813
Encouraged by a little Tariff assistance
more plant was put at work last year and
the turnover improved. But the State takes
with one hand much of what it gives with
the other —last year’s growth in exes, was
chiefly taxation ; the bite (£8874) was almost
double that of the previous year. Neverthe-
less, after paying all its shareholders an
extra 1 p.e., enough profit remained *or
another 5 p.c., and that brought the lay-by.
accumulated in six years, to 214 p.c. of paid
capital after deducting £2s.ooo‘for goodwill.
During The year the co. took up 25,480 new
£1 shares in Yarra Falls, Ltd., and share-
holders were not asked for any of the money
That made the total holding 343,980 shares
on whicl 1 £318,500 was paid up, equal to
03.7 p.c. of A.lv.M.’s paid capital. The
investment, which includes £44,590 of
bonus scrip, brings in a clear 10 p.c.

sion :

The financial position was quite comfori-
able: debtors owed more than was coming
to creditors, including £BOOO on mortgage.
The vulnerable points are stocks and plant.
The former are substantial and a great deal
depends upon the valuation. Looking at
profits back to the slump of 1922 the in-
ference is that stocks have not been over-
valued hitherto. Plant is in at cost, and
on the other side there is a depreciation
reserve of £48,799 (up £18,962), which is
not treated as accumulated profit in the
introductory table. The provision appears
to be substantial; hut the wear and tear on
knitting machines is very heavy.
A couple of months before the close of
accounts shareholders were offered 60,000
new £1 shares in Austral Silk and Cotton
Mills, Ltd. The rights sold at Is. 6d. and
the issue was quickly snapped up. Yarra
Falls. Ltd., and British textile interests
each have £60,000 in the new concern,
which is just about at the producing stage'.
As soon as it is able to supply all Alv.M.'s
cotton-yarn wants, some of the money now
locked up in stocks should become available
for use elsewhere in the business. The mar-
ket thinks the goodwill is much more valu-
able than the figure at which it appears.
And for the scrip, which has a net backing
of 245. 3d. in tangibles, 335. is paid, giving
the investor a return of 6.6 p.c. on an 11 n.e
div. basis,

Blessed with a management which is both
cautious and aggressive, Standard, the baby
of Maoriland’s four insurance cos., is grow-
ing to man’s estate. In its jubilee year.
1024. the handful o’ Dunedinites who run it
celebrated tlie occasion by transferring
£50,000 of reserves to capital, and this year
they have felt that the outlook justifies them
in takin’ anither taste. There is now 20s.
paid up on each £5 share, and 12s. fid. of
that has come out of profits in the last eight
years, so that original shareholders aren't
doing badly. The dividend rate, assuming
distributions are continued on the present
scale, will drop from 16| p.c. to 124 p.c.,
which will look more seemly and offer less
provocation to people who think premiums
ought to be reduced. The money stays in
the business.and policy-holders have the com-
fortable feeling that the shareholders can he
called upon to dig out another £BOO.OOO in
case the Last Day happens or the Shivery
Islands sink. Substantially increased profits
reflect a 33 p.c. advance in premium income
compared with the previous year. Losses and
expenses also create new records, but tin
new business has cost very little. A year
of heavy importing has brought a lot of
fish into the Standard net, but a liberal
risk allowance has been made—not quite as
liberal as used to be the case, but enougn
to satisfy policy-holders that the co. is not
only willing but able to satisfy any honest
claim.
The marked expansion of underwriting
business is shown under: —

The substantial reduction in the expense
rate is something over which the “Wild Cat"
authorises the management to gently pat its
own back, notwithstanding that the experi-
ence has been shared by competing concerns.
The truth is that Maoriland is having one
of its periods of not-feeling-very-wmll, and
money buys a bit more ' than 'it did 12
months ago. But to get £73,000 worth of
new premiums on an outlay of an extra
£5700 is pretty good going, and the investing
public has shown its appreciation of the

Like most other concerns of the kind
Standard is getting shy about loans on
broad acres. The year before the war half
its invested funds were tied up in mortgages.
Latest figures show the proportion has
shrunk to a trifle over 6 p.c. Most of
the assets are now represented by
municipal debentures and Government loan
scrip, with a big wmd in cash and a conser-
vative allowance for premises. Compulsion
to invest in war loan accounts for some
of the change, but the bursting of the land
boom of the early war years and the con-
tinued depression of the farming business
has helped. Here is a comparison of pre-
war and recent figures :-

Mortgages ..£115,965 £30,550 £36,750 £35,950

Cash, etc. .. 47,522 84,979 90,158 107,090
Investments continue to provide nearly
enough interest to pay the dividends. In
their present shape the assets present an
array that ought to satisfy even the Dunedin
policy-holders—close on half a million is
in hard cash and gilt-edged or nearly gilt-
edged securities. And there is a reserve
against depreciation of the securities, a safe-
guard that the “Wild Cat” recommended to
the Standard years ago and which was
sliortlv afterwards adopted.

Dr. Woolnough, Commonwealth oil adviser,
arrived in Queensland five weeks ago a pessi-
mist in regard to oil possibilities there, and
returned last week with the conviction that
there are reasonable chances of finding oil in
commercial quantities. In company with L.
C. Ball, he traversed the country between
Roma and Winton, and his conversion to
optimism may be ascribed to (1) the evi-
dence gathered that favorable geological
structures are present, (2) the paraffins from
the Longreach bore, and (3) the Roma wet
gas. It looks certain now that the Common-
wealth will push on the oil search in Queens-
land and subsidise that State for geological
survey and drilling work. Woolnough’s idea
is that drilling must follow careful survey
work. At present the Roma-Longreaeh belt
of cretaceous and jurassie sediments looks by
far the likeliest oil area in the continent.
* * * *
The Roma O. C. has stopped its bore
after cementing, at 3631 ft., on the strong
advice of the Advisory Oil Board to make
a gas test. This will delay the work about
a week. Progress from now on looks like
being slow, as tests will be taken rather
frequently. Boring last week revealed, if
not a possible oil-sand, at least something
in that neighborhood.
* * * *
The charges made about the running of
the Chillagoe smelters were not unwarranted.
The Queensland Auditor-General’s special
report tabled last week reveals looseness
and irregularities in their management in
which preferential treatment was accorded
to one ore-supplier well known in the North.
When the railway fracas has subsided more
may be heard of the matter.

The clean-up at the Sardine, Kangaroo
Hills (N.Q.), at the beginning of last
month resulted in 34 tons concentrates
from 236 tons ore averaging 14 p.c. There
lias been nothing in recent development to
disturb the equanimity of shareholders. No.
3 north hanging wall has improved the last
couple of weeks, and length of ore proved
there is now 135 ft. Both terminal faces are
in fair to good ore 7 p.c. to 12 p.c. and
each 2ft. wide. This is a distinct shoot from
that in the middle level, as a rise in the
south end has not holed through there, and
last week was 6ft. above the roof of it.
Among other shows on the Hills the just-
floated Metropolitan has crushed 70 tons for
a shade over 2 tons of cones. The grade
is low, but ore in paddock now is said to
be higher, and No. 2 west being driven is on
18 inches of fair-grade stone.

“The Owl” : Re source of gold. Two miles
outside Charters Towers is a ridge of decom-
posed granite interspersed with small
quartz leaders and floaters covered by a
sandy soil, a little puggy. The soil varies
in depths from two inches to a foot. The
whole of this soil carries gold from the
grass-roots to the granite, from the paint
variety to the rough, as large as a pin’s
head. Yet none of the leaders or floaters
contain a speck. Hundreds of prospectors
have to my personal knowledge during the
past 50 years tried to unravel the mystery
of where this gold came from. Not a trace
or color of it could be found once they left
the surface soil.

Numerous working owners have tried the
Los Trois and Royal Flush leases near
Westonia. none very successfully. Adelaide
recently acquired the former, and apparently
liked it so well that it has since taken over
the Royal Flush by means of a syndicate of
600 shares of £lO each. The Royal Flush
contains a reef of the liere-to-day-and-gone-
to-morrow character, and has not yet shown
promise of developing into anything better.
Still, if Adelaide will have its little gamble,
the Royal Blush may be as good a counter as
anything else.

“Fine Gold”: Wiluna (W.A.) claims to
be the first mine in the world where gold
has been won by oil flotation from gold ore
only. The gold hitherto won has been
reckoned a by-product. Wiluna’s boss, Vail,
brought a 115 oz. bar of bullion a distance
of 700-odd miles to Perth and got Minister
for Mines Munsie to face the camera while
holding it aloft in his hand. Next day the
local papers whooped about the success of oil
flotation as applied to gold-ore treatment.

Some details of Lucknow (N.S.W.)
methods, as supplied by the management,
w’ere set out in The Bulletin of July 21
and August 25. These indicate that Luck-
now South, at least, is working, if only on a
small output, and that it has, apparently,
been the policy to ship small parcels of ore
to Germany for treatment. Some has been
treated locally (B. 25/8/’27). The latest
report made public—and the first of its kind
The Bulletin has seen for some time —
appeared in the last week of August:—
South Lucknow Gold Mining Co., N.L., reports
the drive following the lode south-west from the
winze (125 ft. level) has struck another large body
of arsenical pyrites ore. At the north-east end of
the winze a large mass of good ore is available. From
this ore recently an oxidised sample was assayed
for 15oz. gold, and one of the arsenical pyrites for
18oz. 6dwt. gold per ton.
All quite excellent, no doubt. But the
co. would inspire more confidence in its
shareholders —some of whom seem to be
utterly in the dark as to its activities and
even doubtful of its continued existence —if
it came out in the open and circularised its
shareholders, giving them a statement of the
actual situation. As it is, quite a lot of
them have been writing to The Bulletin
complaining that the only news they hear
from the co. is to the effect that there is
another call due.

Southern Ocean Oil Co. has that fine
quality, perseverance. At the half-yearly
meeting in Adelaide it was reported that the
bore at Kingston was down to 2000 ft. in very
hard rock, and would be deepened another
200 ft. to 300 ft. By then the funds would be
exhausted. Two samples of rock had been
analysed by the Government Analyst; one
from 1700 ft. went l-200th part of 1 p.c. of
oil, the other from 2000 ft. did not contain
any oil. Most people would have thrown in
the towel on receipt of that. Especially after
Dr. Keith Ward, the Government Geol-
ogist, had reported last March that further
boring was hopeless. These shareholders
deserve a medal for valor.

A second borehole at Lake Bunga, Lakes
Entrance, Gippsland, has reached 1100 feet
and the core contains traces of oil. The
ancient game of pegging-out has gone on
merrily and every foot of likely leasing area
has been pegged; Mines Department officials
are on their way to take samples, and the
fate of Lake Bunga as a likely oil producer
will be decided for the second time. One
disquieting feature of the find is the absence
of gas in any quantity, and no oil of com-
mercial value is ever found without gas.

The second triennial Empire Mining and
Metallurgical Conference, just held at Mon-
treal, had some interest for Australians in
the flattering tribute paid to our industry
and initiative in developing the alluvial tin
industry in Malaysia, the flatterer being no
less than Sir Robert Horne, ex-Chancellor of
the Exchequer, one of the British repre-
sentatives of the conference. Apart from his
other activities, Horne is among the heads of
the National Producers and Smelters’
Agency, formed in the wartime to combat
the German smelting combine. Its members
include several Australian concerns, chiefly
connected with Broken Hill, and the Burma
Corporation and most of the Welsh smelting
propositions are also said to be interested.
One object of the co. was to keep the price
of lead stable. Of course it failed : it had to.

Larut’s plant heads the August list of
Eastern tin shows, with 95 tons of t.o. from
359,000 yards. This is well ahead of the
harvest for the first half of August—44 tons.
The yield is a little worse than two-tliirds
of a pound to the yard; but Larut’s costs
are very low. Austral Malay’s shows con-
tinued in good vein. At Asam Ivambang dry
weather and sunken timber hampered opera-
tions, yet it took 30 tons from 60.000 yards
(=.781b. per c.y.). Kampong, with 27 tons
in the first half of the month, totalled 57
for the full run, the tin yield being .961 b.
to the c.y. Ulu Yam’s 36 tons was a slight
falling-off from the first fortnight’s perform-
ance, but here again the average yield per
yard, .84, was good. Thabawleik had a
better spin, and from its small turnover of
86,000 yards returned I.Blb. to the yard
Kuala Lumpur, with 171 tons, dropped
below its July run of 23 tons, but had a
three days’ stoppage through a dredge break-
down. The erection of the second dredge,
a very up-to-date affair of big capacity, is
proceeding well, and the entry of this big
plant on the scene should considerably im-
prove turnover and recoveries. Tin Bentong
dropped from its July 34 tons to 22.7
tons. This came from 61,300 yards, which
is much below the estimated lib. per yard.
Of the two Ronpibons, Extended had another
poor spin with but 7 tons taken out of 77,000
yards, which is even worse than July’s 11
tons. The dredge is small, but that does
not account for the disappointing average,
which is below that of lloz. per yard for
1926. Ronpibon returned 2l| tons from
60,000 yards, which is a trifle below the
July figure. Dredging returns on this pro-
perty have never been equal to the high
bore values, but the ground, which is largely
stiff clay and very difficult to work, has been
responsible for most of the troubles. But they
may blow over, for there is said to be plenty
of rich ground still untouched.
The Malay-Siamese returns furnish more
cheerful reading. Phin Soon took out 21.7
tons of t.o. from 29,452 yards, and expects its
reorganised plant to be ready to start in a
month’s time, when a greatly increased out-
put and higher recoveries are expected.
Nawng Pet, the co.’s big sluicing show, also
had a fair run with 18.6 tons from 28,610
yards, though a recently-reported recurrence
of one of the periodical floods from which
the Pet suffers may take some of the gilt
off that gingerbread. The dredges for the
Huey Yot and Haad Yai shows are well
forward, and delivery is expected on contract
time. Surface prospecting on the co.’s lode-
tin proposition at Kohsabah, of which little
has been heard for some time, has been
concluded, and contracts have been let for
driving on the ore bodies at depth.

Tanah Biji, a Malayan holding and pros-
pecting co„ which has close affiliations with
Alluvial Tin, is the parent of Jelapang and
Serendah, two flotations in which it holds
25,000 shares (f.p.) and 32,000 shares (f.p.)
respectively. Jelapang hopes to get its dredge
going late this year; Serendah is hoping
for delivery in January, 1928. Both proper-
ties have been thoroughly tested by A. P.
Penman, and promise well. Jelapang’s capi-
tal is £l2O 000 in £1 shares, all f.p. ; Seren-
dah’s authorised capital is £165,000; issued
capital was £60,000 f.p. shares and 105,000
contribs. paid to ss. Tanah Biji share-
holders w r ere invited to take up 100,000 of
these. Tanah Biji’s second annual report
shows a balance on P. and L. account of
£28,006, and states, in addition, that the
co. has been busy investigating further pro-
perties, with a view, etc.

Ratrut Basin is getting near the end of its
transfer of plant and material from the old
site at Renong to the new property at
Sichon, Siam. The old dredge has been
totally dismantled, and the last shipment was
to be made from Renong on August 28.
Superstructure and machinery are at Sichon,
and re-erection is expected to begin early
in October. A thousand tons of rails for the
track between Sichon and the 15-miles
distant property have been landed, and tlio
line should bp laid and ready by the end of
this month. Work on the new 150,000 c.y.
per month dredge, which is being built in
Sydney, is getting on all right. Some 140
tons of pontoon material was dispatched
early in August, and there is to be a Sep-
tember shipment.. By October next year this
big and up-to-date electrically-worked plant
should be churning. Meantime the old
dredge, a bucket machine of the old type,
should have shown shareholders how the
dredging returns on the new property
measure up to engineer J. M. White’s boring
tests of the new ground. These indicate
a high average tin content over about 515
acres, which, divided into three sections,
show 28oz„ 16oz. and 12oz. respectively.

Tinsongkhla is a Melbourne float, born
under the eye of A. W. Palfreyman, in Feb-
ruary, 1926. It was formed to handle the
undertakings of Eastern Options, especially
those near Songlthla, in Southern Siam.
Authorised capital is £lBO,OOO in £1 shares.
Issued is in 65,500 f.p. ordinary shares,
64,000 contributing paid to 155., and 10,000
cum. 10 p.c. prefs., f.p., these last going
to the underwriters, Palfreyman and associ-
ates. Eastern Options propositions other
than that at Songkhla wore handed over to
another new co., Eastern Tin, in which Tin-
songkhla shareholders have been allotted
70,250 shares paid to Is. Tinsongkhla’s
property is 172 acres, which has been bored
in sections: 20 acres, averaging 26ft. deep,
go 170 z., as do 80 acres 16ft. to 30ft. deep.
Sixty acres, with a 50ft. depth, go 14|oz.
Dredgable ground is estimated at 9,250,000
c.y. The dredae to go on this ground is of
the very considerable capacity for so small
an area of 140,000 c.y. Owing, however, to
a dispute as to title, over which the co. lost
a legal action, delivery of the dredge was
delayed, and a fresh site for its erection had
to be selected. There is no permanent water
in sight, and the co. will have to tackle a
conservation scheme. It reports, however,
that the dredge material is now on the
ground, and should be under steam from the
end of June next —an optimistic forecast.
On present figures paid-up capital is
£122.664. Mine property is valued at
£77,865 and the dredge at £47,880. Creditors
were owed £15,392, and cash balance was
£2933.

“Geo-Pliysic”: Two aeroplanes are shortly
to make an aerial survey of New Guinea in
aid of two British geologists who are going
next year to investigate the chances of find-
ing oil there. Here is a chance to send a
group of geo-pliysical experts with their
delicate electric prospecting instruments to
find out exactly where the oil lies, after
the geologists have located a correct geolo-
gical structure. That is the regular proce-
dure now on the American oilfields, especi-
ally in Texas, where several new fields have
been discovered recently. First the geologist
maps the area after finding a proper struc-
ture for oil, and then the geo-physical group
uses all its various methods of delimiting
the subterranean bodies or deposits of petro-
leum. The saving in outlay by avoiding
blind stubbing is considerable.

Beef-baron W. C. Angliss, M.L.C. (Vic.),
told the Royal Commission on freezing works
in Melbourne the other day how he had begun
in a small way as a butcher at Carlton
when he was on the verge of manhood. Now
he is the head of a company which runs
large grazing areas in Vic., N.S.W. and
Bananaland, and has a finger or two in other
meatpies.
The recent congress of the N.S.W. branch
of the R.S.S.I.L.A. gave President Davison,
the Nationalist candidate for Woollahra, to
understand that, as a non-political body, it
would not allow its officers to take a promin-
ent part in politics. Davison declined to
jettison his Parliamentary ambitions—and
congress elected a new president. Then,
on three subsequent motions, it unanimously
elected Davison past president, returned him
to the executive and appointed him custodian
of the cenotaph, “the most honorable post
the league had to offer.”
M. L. Shepherd, who was official secre-
tary to Joe Cook at Australia House, told
this at a farewell by Australian pressmen
in London. “One of my best bosses,” he
said, “was Paddy Crick. When I w r ent to
him with a problem I couldn’t solve, and
which proved to be beyond him, too, he used
to say ‘Let’s tear the blanky thing up.’
And a torn document fluttered into his
capacious w.p.b.”
Nine years ago Tom Tunnecliffe, now Vic.
Minister for Railways, published a pamphlet
on “The Delusion of Price Fixing.” Its
existence was recalled the other night in
Vic. Assembly when Stan Argyle produced
and quoted from a copy to the amusement of
the Opposition. Argyle, speaking on the Milk
Price-fixing bill, brought forward by Hogan’s
Ministry, was citing authorities on the folly
of this sort of regulation, and went back
to the pre-Christian era for early examples
of its futility. Urged by Labor members
to cite modern instances he turned to Tunne-
cliffe’s “Delusion.” The quotations kept
the Opposition in a simmer of amusement,
but Tunnecliffe was absent.
Australian history owes something to
Charles Trimby Burfitt. He was at different,
times president and secretary and at all
times hard worker for the Australian His-
torical Society. He wms also regarded as
an authority on the languages and customs
of the abo. Burfitt was born 78 years ago
at Orange, and a country store and an auc-
tioneer's rostrum occupied most of his busi-
ness life. He spent his last 20 years in the
pursuit of his hobbies.
“Snowdon” : Mention of the fact that Sam
Manger’s name is pronounced Major (B.
11/8/’27) brings to mind an incident that
occurred at a meeting at which he wms to
be the star. The chairman mentioned that
the chief speaker wmuld be Mr. Mowger.
Another speaker on the platform tugged his
sleeve and whispered “Major.” The chair-
man smiled apologetically at Sam and cor-
rected himself. “The chief speaker will be
Major Mowger.”
E. M. Horsington, when a private member,
used to blow in and out of Broken Hill almost
unnoticed. He finds things more!) worrying now
that he carries a portfolio. While putting
in a little pre-selection work recently he
was told by a strong deputation of some of
the city’s needs and desires. And there were
many growls on various matters. Horsington
sought escape in the politician’s promise
that everything along the line of lode would
be O.K. “if the Government is returned to
power.”
Granville Ryrie arrived in London on
Wednesday, July 13, and swung into action
with enthusiasm. These were some of his
opening engagements: Thursday, lunch with
Amery, Secretary of State for the Dominions;
Friday, luncheon to Duke and Duchess of
York at the Guildhall; Monday, lunch with
Joe Cook; Tuesday, Australian and N.Z.
Luncheon Club. It’s the pace that fills.
The anonymous person who caused heart-
burning by presenting £lOOO to the Police
Benevolent Fund in Vic. has confessed to
being J. A. Wallace, a N. S. Wales pastor-
afist whose father was a pioneer miner in
the Ovens district (Vic.) and owned the
valuable Melbourne site where the Aspro
people have since erected a building out of
headaches. Wallace, jun., is a director of
Tarrant’s motors and a member of the Mel-
bourne Club and the Vic. Racing Club, but
his motive was sympathy for the disabled
John and grew from understanding of liis
lot when the donor served as a special
during the police strike of 1923. Chief-Sec.
Prendergast has done the right thing in
ordering the money to be handed back.
There are plenty of people with less reput-
able motives who would like a precedent for
being kind to the police.
HEREDITY AND ENVIRONMENT.
“What’s the difference between heredity and environment, old girl?”
“Well, heredity got you that money from your grandfather, and environment made
you spend it.”
“Ah Kee”: Randolph Bedford is justified
in claiming (B. 11/8/'27) John Moffat as
an Australian pioneer. The transportation
of machinery and plant, on mules, from the
coast to Irviiiebank (N.Q.), over the
4000 ft.-high Herberton, Watsonville and
Irvinebank Ranges, would have dismayed
most men. John Moffat thought no-
tliing of it. For years he was the king of
those mountains. On my first trip there a
gloomy life-insurance canvasser described
! lim 11 ' the men talk of nothin S
but John Moffat. The women gossip across
the fences about John Moffat. When they
put the kids to bed they teach them to
pray: ‘God bless John Moffat’; and when
everybody has gone to sleep, and you think
you’ll get a little rest, the frogs in the dam
start, and all night they croak: ‘Moffat,
Moffat, Moffat.’ ”
Col. Knox, of Upper Yarra, whose dad, a
mining magnate, was a legislator before him,
is beginning to win attention in Vic.
Assembly. Discussing Labor’s Milk Price-
Fixing Bill he said he was willing to sink
his principles against price-fixing because of
the state of dairying and because doctors and
other professionals fixed prices. “So do
M’s.P.” suggested Blackburn. Knox ex-
pressed an earnest hope that no attempt
would be made to alter the existing prices
of members. Speaker Snowball, who knows
that a majority of his fellow-workers want
higher rates, enjoined Knox, with great
seriousness, not to “make remarks that
create disorder.”
After 38 years of service Truby King is to
retire from his job as Inspector-General of
Mental Defectives in Maoriland. In his
search for the root-causes of mental defi-
ciency in children he set out on schemes of
child welfare which are now known from
Pole to Pole. Although there had previously
been some German and Swiss experiments,
King was the first man to induce a whole
country to take an interest in the proper
nutrition and health treatment of its children.
The systems that he has built up have won
him world fame.
Lest anybody should forget that they
served while the Big Scrap was on, Labor’s
quartette in Vic. Assembly—Slater, Hughes,
Pollard and Webber —occasionally give the
House direct or indirect reminders. Hughes
is the most aggressive, with Pollard a good
second. Slater’s allusions are indirect.
Sometimes Hughes falls in, as when he
picked at Mackrell, sec. to the Cocky Ten,
who had enlisted in S’Africa and served
under Botha after William the Goat had run
amok. The other night Hughes turned his
guns on Greenwood, who replied that three
doctors had pronounced him unfit for war
service. The wordy duel ended by Hughes
indicating his willingness to meet Greenwood
outside. The most distinguished Digger in
the House, iCol Bourchier, never hints that
he had a khaki suit except by inference
when he is telling a good yarn in the lobby
or his office.
Raynor Iloff will do the sculptural work
for the S. Aus. National War Memorial. Hoff
has charge of the Sydney Technical College
Art Classes, part of the school which was
once the old Darlinghurst gaol. His own
work apart, Hoff’s enthusiasm has brought
out the genius in a number of young Aus-
tralians. And he isn’t resting on his achieve-
merits.
j oe Clarke, who triumphed over the Lang-
Willis faction in the recent Castloren°h
selection ballot, is a Sydney native Startfeg
fife as a tailor’s apprentice, he set up in
business in Coonamble 30 years ago, and for
15 years was on the local council, part of the
time as Mayor. The holder of an A.W.U.
ticket since 1894, he held off politics untii
1917, when he unsuccessfully opposed Guy
Arkins. Elected for Wammerawa in 1920,
he was defeated at the following general
election, but on appealing to the Electoral
Qualifications and Disputes Committee was
awa ™ed W. G. Ashford’s seat.
Vic. Forest Commission’s new chairman,
A. V. Galbraith, is a young man with a
habit of getting on. He has risen from
secretary to third and then second commis-
sioner in a few years. A Geelong State-
school boy, he feels there is always some-
thing still to learn : despite his £lOOO a year,
he is chasing a commerce degree at Mel-
bourne University.
Passed out at Northeote the other day
Joshua Pitt, a giant Yorkshireman and one
of Victoria’s best-known tanners. Pitt did
not spend his early working years worrying
about a reduction in hours or an increase
in wages. With small capital, large deter-
mination and two of the brawniest arms ever
possessed by a hide-thrower, he commenced
to tan skins in a vat in his back yard.
Prom these small beginnings was evolved in
a quarter of a century the huge tannery of
Pitt's Pty., Ltd. Two sons will carry on the
work.
Parramatta Historical Society did rever-
ence the other day to the memory of a man
who made an effort to do well by Aus-
tralia. Baron de Clambe was a French
officer who came here in 1801. He received
a grant of land at Castle Hill, where he
built “The Hermitage”—to which the
society made a pilgrimage. De Clambe
started the cultivation of cotton and coffee,
but died while returning from a visit to
France, and his experiments died with him.
When M. T. MacEachern, the American
surgeon, was in Australia investigating our
hospital system and methods, Dr. T. Hamil-
ton, of the Newcastle Hospital, attracted
his attention. Hamilton has now been
granted six months’ leave of absence to join
the staff of the American surgeon in New
York, where he will study the most modern
methods of hospital administration as well as
anything else in the pill and knife trade.
Hamilton is a product of Sydney University.
C. A. McAlister, of Beddestone, near Glen
Innes (N.S.W.), is in pursuit of his share
of £20,000, which is the estimated worth of
a painting of “The Holy Family,” sold in a
city auction-room for half a crown. Mc-
Alister’s father bought the picture at a
clearing sale at the house of Hannibal
Macarthur. He left it to C.A., who, when
he went to the war, gave it into his brother’s
charge. The brother and his wife died within
a week, and the picture was sold with other
household effects. When news came that the
painting, sent to America, had been accepted
as a work of the fourteenth or fifteenth cen-
tury, the ex-owner awoke to the fact that
£20,000 is a lot of money. lie is now hot
on the legal trail for some of the treasure
which he considers his.
The N.S.W. end of the Scottish delegation,
which aims at a systematised flow of fellow -
Scots to Australia, is being managed by
Wallace Nelson, journalist and lecturer.
Nelson was the official speaker attached to
the White Train when that caravan travelled
the N.S.W. country towns to create a greater
interest in Australian-made goods. He has
a nice command of language to grace his
new job, and backs his oratory with vast
energy. He loves argument above all things.
It was at a country railway station that
Wallace buttonholed another traveller and
deluged him with argument. “I don’t want
to hear you speak about that,” finally his
victim said, resentfully. “Does it not occur
to you that I may want to hear myself
speak about it?” retorted Nelson, promptly;
and the torrent of argument swii'led on.
Quite a lot of interesting secrets were
buried with Sir George Lewis when the famous
“society solicitor” went to his grave as the
result of a railway accident in Switzerland.
He bothered little with the courts, but sat
in his old-fashoned chambers while the Great
and the would-be Great came to him to con-
fess their sins of omission and commission.
The reputations of half Britain’s upper
classes were said to be in his keeping. They
must have been a heavy burden.
One of the incidents in the early life of
Daniel Burke, Tasmania’s Grand Old Man.
who struggled past the century post before
death ended the race, was to assist in the
escape of the Irish revolutionary, John Mit-
chel. Mitchel, who, by the way, was the
uncle of William Irvine, C.J., was hidden in
the Burke household as “nurse” to the baby
until arrangements were made for his escape
from the State in clerical garments. The
baby, William Burke, now nearly 80, is still
alive.
Henry M. Collins, who is spending the
sunset of his life at Frankston (Vic.), was
47 years in the service of Reuter; for 30 as
Australasian g.m. Sixt5 r -one years ago he
established branches throughout India and
adjacent parts, and while still in his twen-
ties, as Reuter’s special representative, nego-
tiated a big railways and public utility con-
cession with the Persian Government. When
Collins joined the service in ’62 every mail
steamer that left New York (those were
pre-cable days) carried Reuter news dis-
patches in hermetically-sealed tins. Reuter
had his own line, 90 miles in length, down
the Irish coast from Roche’s Point to Crook-
haven. His own steamer intercepted the
liners, and, picking up the canned news,
dashed to Crookhaven, whence it would be
wired to London, competitors being thus
beaten by eight or nine hours.

Sales Dissection is an important figure job in any business. It answers your
questions: “Who is my best salesman?”—“Which is my most profitable line?”
-—“Which is my most profitable department?” —“Do I sell more goods on credit
than for cash?”
With these and similar questions answered every day, you are able to make
comparisons with previous records, watch the trend of business, and provide suitable
safeguards against losses.
The Burroughs “Duplex” is the ideal machine for obtaining these facts. It is
actually “two adding machines in one,” for it gives the individual totals for each
salesman, department or line, and then a grand total of all sales automatically
without re-listing a single individual total.
Think of the importance of Sales Dissection for your business. Then think of
the time that the Burroughs “Duplex” will save in obtaining these essential figures.
Not only will it save time, but it will make the work so agreeable and easy that this
valuable information will be ready each day.
It will cost you nothing to ascertain how the Burroughs Duplex will benefit
your business. Just phone or write to our nearest office, and we shall be pleased
to arrange a free demonstration.

“C.A.A.” : Much better than saplings for
timber-splitters’ mauls (B. 11/8/’2T) is a
fallen box-tree of a diameter up to 3ft.
Quarter it, remove the sap and pipe portions
of the wood, and the remainder, if roughly
rounded or even squared, will be much more
suitable. It is good wood right through, and
being free of sap on the outside the rings will
not fall off, nor the middle tend to wear
into a hollow, li the ends, instead of being
sawn straight across, are chipped off with an
axe and partly ovalled it will further check
any tendency to hollowing out.

“Toby” : Goats do not take long to revert
to the wild state. A few years back one of
tbe keepers at the Byron (N.S.W.) light-
house had a flock numbering about 30. They
spent most of the time down the sides of
the great promontory, but returned to their
living-quarters at nigbt. On leaving the job
the keeper passed the goats to an assistant,
who instead of locking them up at night
allowed them to remain on the cliffs. There
they made their permanent abode half-way
down the main precipice, about 200 feet
above the waters foaming and chafing on the
rocks below. They feed on the grass and
small bushes that grow up the side. _ Any
sound from above causes them to remain per-
fectly still, whilst a stone thrown sets them
scampering down the slope at breakneck
speed, led by a huge, scraggy black-and-
brindle William.

“Tobias C.” : Barney McGinty, of Goondi-
windi (Q.), is known to his neighbors as
“Greenhide” McGinty. This title was be-
stowed on him the year they had the goanna
plague in S.-W. Bananaland. Barney had
fastened a new “Condamine” to his flea-
bitten nag with a piece of greenhide, and
by some means the steed detached himself
from the rattle. A hungry go’ found it and
swallowed the greenhide strap. Barney set
out, bridle in hand, to bring in the ’orse,
but though he could hear the bell clanging
vigorously he spent five days in pursuit with-
out locating either beast or bell. He was
beginning to suspect his sanity when a
rabbit-trapper hooked the elusive bell-ringer
and restored the undigested bell to its
owner.

“Adah”: For the last 30 years skylarks
have made a home in Centennial Park, Syd-
ney. They were introduced there by the
late Henry Copeland, sometime _ Agent-
General. When returning to Australia Cope-
land brought with him a number of the birds,
hoping to acclimatise them in Sydney. Many
perished on the voyage; the few survivors
were taken to his home, which was at Rand-
wick, not far from the park. The birds
appear to have kept close to their original
breeding-ground, for I have never heard the
song of the lark in any other parts of Syd-
ney—or Australia, for that matter.
ON THE STRICT Q.T.
CONVERTED GENT.: “Ah yairs, frinds, I’m now willin’ to do anything the Lord wants
me to—if it ain’t dishonorable.”
“ J.H.S.” : The location of white-ants’ nests
on trees (B. 4/8/’27) happens to be a sub-
ject to which I gave careful study when a
young shaver. My observations in coastal
country went to show that the situation fav-
ored was the sunny side of the tree, north,
east and west, the majority being on
the north and north-east. I don’t remember
ever seeing a nest on the south side, while
more mounds faced eastwards than west-
wards. I should say it would be possible for
an intelligent bushman to pick the points of
the compass by a careful study of the loca-
tion of these mounds, provided they were
sufficiently numerous. I’d be prepared to do
it in my own district.

“Ziff”: “Hard times,” said Charlie the
Liar —“you blokes don’ know w’at hard
times is. W’en times was reely bad I worked
three munce fer a cocky ’oo ’adn’t a copper.
• ‘Sorry, Charlie,’ he says, w’en ’e tol’ me, ‘but
you can take your pick of those hogs of
mine.’ As that was the on’y chance I had of
getting anythink at all, I took the best pig
and drove him along the road. I walked a
fair- distance that day and put up at a farm-
house. The farmer put it on me for some
cash for me tucker and bed. O’ course I ’ad
none, so he suggested me leavin’ the porker
with ’im and takin’ one of ’is a bit smaller.
I simply ’ad ter swap. I ’ad two more experi-
ences like that along the road, an’ walked
into Nulpa with me swag and a sucking pig
under me arm. An’ strike me if a John
don’t run me in fer bringin’ swine fever inter
the town and a hard-hearted beak fines me a
fiver. But that’s nothin’ to the time”
“Six o’clock, gentlemen, six o’clock!” boomed
the voice of Bung.

“C. Coral” : Plere is the Island version of
Baron Munchausen and the cherry-stones,
according to old Maino: “One boy, name
Dauai, belong these islands, he very dirty
boy. One day he go for sleep underneath a
dwni r%] tree; and seed he fall down on
top his head. When he wake up, he no
think about that seed stop along his head,
’cause his head he dirty. That seed start
grow now, he come Dig one, but that boy he
don’t take him out. When that tree come
proper big one, all them pigeon he come for
sit down along branches. That boy he tink
‘All right, he very good for me for catch
pigeon.’ So he sit down with that tree along
his head, and when pigeon come close-to he
chuck some tucker and catch them pigeon for
kai-kai. Dauai he got brother, and that
brother he speak ‘Which way that tree he
fast along you head? I like that same ting
too for catch pigeon.’ Dauai lie tell him
how that seed he fall down and grow him-
self, but that brother he no believe him. and
he tell him ‘You break* off branch and put
him along my head.’ He talk talk too much
and Dauai be get wild now; he say ‘All
right, you no believe me, very well, I put
branch along you head like you want.’ lie
take knife and chop one branch and plant
him along head belong his brother. But that
wood he sharp, he go right inside head and
kill him, so he finish altogether.”
* * * *
“Up Top” : That new curse the Singapore
ant, about the size of a grain of sand, can
raise a lump as big as a marble. These pests
have a liking for the armpits and more ten-
der portions of the body. From Port Darwin
as far down as Pine Creek along the railway
line they are to be found, having, it is sup-
posed, been introduced by Asiatic laborers.
A lad at the Creek left his hat atop of the
mosquito net overnight. Next morning he
jambed it on his Head and had to bolt to the
shower to get rid of the undesirable immi-
grants. When he came out his forehead was
swollen to an enormous size and his face was
red as a cooked lobster. The pests appear in
most unexpected places without apparent
cause and their minute size makes them difli-
cult to avoid.
“J. Point”: I seen in a poultry paper
where a Digger up Innisfail way was feedin’
garlic to ’is chooks so as to give the eggs
a special flavor for a customer ’oo kept a
fisli-an’-chips joint. Before that Digger knoo
where ’e wus, Eyetalians for miles round
was payin’ ’im double market prices for ’is
garlic-flavored eggs. I’ve thought it over a
lot since I read about that, and I think I’ve
got the right oil now. My idea is to feed
the ’ens a ration of molasses (I can get it
for the cartin’ away) mixed with brewer’s
grains and yeast. A ’en’s innards is a wun-
nerful thing, and I’ll bet them eggs'll be
flavored with the finest o’ rum. Can you
imagine ’ow wowsers ’oo drink nothing
stronger ’n egg-flips ’ll back their carts in
for my rummy eggs? An’ wot about an
export trade to America?

“Bert the Carpenter” : A lot of the abuse
directed at tool-handles of Australian tim-
bers is misdirected—it should be levelled at
the men who make the handles. Many a
bush-worker fells a young tree, cuts off a
length, carts it home, chops out a handle and
puts it straight into an axehead. The
fibres in the still green and tender wood
are strained and ruptured when the axe is
used, and the handle snaps or goes to pieces
in a short time. The timber should be cut
from young, straight-grown trees and, while
still green, • split into billets lengthwise and
stacked up to season for at least a year.
The stack should then be sorted over, and
all twisted, warped or “shaky” stuff re-
jected. Treated like this, tool-handles made
from lilly-pilly, silver wattle, she-oak or
other suitable native woods could soon
chase hickory off the market.

THE WOMAN WHO SMILES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You will meet them at the stations,
Settlers’ homes and miners’ shacks,
Ever with some cheery glances
For the battler on the tracks;
Little pommy brides from London
Under newer, bluer skies,
There’ll be always one amongst them
With a welcome in her eyes.
When you ask for work or tucker
Some may hesitate awhile,
But you’re sure of full and plenty
From the woman with a smile.
Though the trask is hot and dusty
And your boots have chafed your feet,
Long and wearily you’ve fasted
And you crave for rest and meat,
Quick you’ll feel your troubles vanish
And your spirits rise anew
When a kitchen door is opened
And a woman smiles at you.
Self-respect comes racing backward
With your manhood all the while
lYhen you’re gazing at the woman
Who has found a kindly smile.
And you’ll square your drooping shoulders
Ragged where the swag-straps wear,
And you’ll wonder what you look like
And you’ll wish you’d brushed your hair,
While the sun-tan and the whiskers
Hide what might have been a blush
For the soiled and greasy trousers
Where the blackened billies brush.
Very awkwardly you’ll thank her
With a shyness infantile —
Oh. the bush is much the brighter
For a woman with a smile!
You will meet them from the sea-line
To the Never Never rim,
When your faith in luck is failing
And your star of hope is dim.
In some God-forsaken township
Where you never felt so crook,
From the camps and teamsters’ waggons
There is sunshine in a look.
Even where the bush is hardest.
Where the shifting sandhills pile,
You may look to find a woman
With the phantom of a smile.
THE SOCIAL WHIRLIGIG.
BOSS: “What are you after with the waddy, Jackie?”
JACKIE: “My Mary she bin clear out longa ’nother pfeller. Reg’lar Mary-go-round,
that one.”
Where the track seems never ending
And the West spreads like a fan,
When the goal looks none the nearer
Since the journey first began,
fou’U be better for the knowledge
That beyond the dreary miles
There's a homestead by the wayside
Where a cheerful woman smiles.
Tucker bags will bulge to bursting
And you’ll feel that life’s worth while
When you’re camping by the homestead
Where a woman casts her smile.

clear of all care for growers if this step is taken:
SEND THE CLIP TO
WINCHCOMBE, CARSON
LTD.
Selling Brokers, Sydney or Brisbane.
A capable firm, energetic, reliable and successful.
“Sea Nomad”: Natives of Torres Strait
have a peculiar idea of “sympathetic pain.”
Thus, if the wife is soon to greet the Stork
and hubby gets a tummy-aclie or toothache,
he blows his chest out and reckons he is
relieving his mate of her birth-pains. On
the child’s arrival the husband frequently
dives into the sea, and sometimes stays in
the water for hours, believing that the cooler
he makes his body the cooler his wife be-
comes. I don’t know how it would fare in
the event of twins. Probably the husband
wrnuld never know of the catastrophe, as it
is considered a great disgrace among island
women to bear two at birth. One is inevit-
ably strangled, and it is always the girl if
there is one of each.
* * * *
“Biro”: I can’t understand “Wingella”
saying a person could mistake goanna-
flesh for curried chicken (B. 4/8/’27), un-
THE OMNISCIENT NIGGER.
MRS. PAPUA: “You been go Sydney, Magani? You savee white man things, eh?”
MAGANI: “Me savee See-knee. Me savee ebery white man somet’ing!”
MRS. PAPUSA (pointing to a horseshoe on the wall ): “What name this something,
Magani?”
MAGANI ( contemptuously ): “Him? Dat motor-tyre belong horse!”
less the t go. turns a different color in the
N.T. when cooked than he does in N. S.
Wales. The go.’s flesh I have seen cooked
could not be mistaken for poultry of any
kind. The meat looked red, and not unlike
the flesh of an eel. Rabbit or bandicoot is
white, like fowl; but not goanna.
“Kayeff”: The butter-fish described by
“D.M.E.” (B. 11/8/’27) seems to be a very
different customer from the one known by
that name on the Queensland coast. The
latter is a smallish chap with broad yellow
and black stripes running across his body.
Often found near an outflow of sewage, he
is regarded with suspicion as a table fish,
though of fine flavor and texture. In the
Islands, large shoals can be seen just be-
yond where the waves are breaking on a
flat reef. Rising in a multicolored cloud to
each wave, they hold their position against
the strong backwash by attaching themselves
to the rocks by a hooked spike on the ventral
fin. Owing to the curvature of this hook
they all face landward, and in their black
and yellow uniforms present rather a mili-
tary appearance.
* * -i= *
“Black Tracker”: A party of motorists
returned from a trip through Queensland’s
back country tell of a little girl naturalist,
the daughter of a dogger, living a wild life
in wild country. This child of the bush
appeared to be on friendly terms with all
the living things around lier. Birds of all
kinds answered her call and struggled for
positions on her head and shoulders. A
carpet-snake followed her about like a dog.
Parent birds made not the slightest objec-
tion to her inspecting and handling their
young. Insects, too, of various kinds were
handled without fear. Even the dreaded
red-back spiders responded to her call and
accepted flies from her hand.
* * * *
“Jobber”: Someone recently mentioned
edible roots. In my youth I toiled for a
time on a Queensland cattle-station, to
which one day came a German, of high
education but with an empty nosebag. The
boss put him on cutting burr. One day he
rushed into the hut like an elephant in hys-
terics, with his hand at his mouth, and mut-
tering all sorts of weird noises which not
one of us could interpret. However, we
rendered first-aid, and after Fritz became
able to talk he told us of his habit of trying
round for roots that were fit to eat. This
day he was stiff enough to give cungevoi a
trial, and it nearly burnt his tongue out.
**■ ■ * *
“Coola”: In Central N.S.W. birds that
usually nest in September, suck as blue
martins and greenies, this year had their
broods out of the nest by the middle of August.
In normal years we do not see the martins
till September. The greenies are probably
tempted to appear by blossoms which the
warm sun has forced along. Wattles whose
bloom is often protracted as late as October
are bursting into flower. Evidently heavy
frosts —and this year holds a record in
frosts —do not prevent the sap rising so long
as the sun is warm.
THINGS COMING RIGHT AT LAST.
COLLECTOR: “Got anything for me to-day except excuses?”
THE BAD MARK: “No. I’ve ’ad a lot of worry, an’ me ’usband’s dyin’; but ’e’s ’eavy
insured and I ’opes I’ll soon be able to pay you right off.”
“Bulantum”: Prospectors on the Bulolo
and Watut rivers, in New Guinea, are fre-
quently stung by two plants, one being simi-
lar to a nettle and having broad leaves about
six inches long. The
pain from its sting lasts
about two hours. The'
natives claim exceptional
medicinal properties for
the plant and use its
leaves for enriching
soups and stews; also,
after bruising them, they
rub the pulp on sprains
and bruises. The other
stinging plant is a para-
site found growing on
timber which has been
felled. It has a leaf
about two inches broad
by seven in length. A
sting from this fellow
causes huge white lumps
to appear on the flesh,
and the victim suffers
agony for several days.
The application of water
to the wood increases
the pain.
$
“Tassie”: Having
struck Trial Harbor
more than 35 years ago,
when the West Coast’s
only highways were bush
tracks, I have good
reason to know the tim-
ber country of that part
of the Speck, and I say
again I have never seen
a track laid over hori-
zontal scrub (B.
4/S/’27). Many a small
• patch of valuable Huon
ind King William pine
we have had to leave un-
touched owing to the cost
and difficulty of trans-
port, w-liere, had it been
possible to lay a track over the horizontal,
we could have dragged the logs to the
water’s edge or the railway-line.
* * *
“Carisbrook, Jun.”: I disagree with “The
Trumper” (B. 28/7/’27) when he says that
snake-fat has no objectionable odor. Many
native tribes, before cooking and eating a
snake, carefully remove the rolls of fat and,
after letting them simmer in the sun for about
a week, rub their bodies with them. If “The
Trumper” were present at this toilette he’d
change both his spot and his mind.
* * * *
“Yarri”: Jim Hannigan bought a cattle-
pup at Tattumbah, Richmond River
(N.S.W.), and chained him to a kennel
at the side of his house. In the night the
pup set up a wailing protest, which became
so monotonous that Hannigan got up and
wrathfully dragged the serenader down the
hank of a grassy gully and tied him to a
sapling. In the morning, when he went
down to get him, he found a 10ft. carpet-
snake on the chain with a big bulge in the
middle of it. The bulge was the pup.
H*
“Medicus” : Is “bear pool” still played? In
the days when a coach and four rumbled
its way from Tarago to Braidwood (N.S.W.)
we used to beguile the weary miles with this
game. Sixpence a head went into the pool,
and the first man to spot a native-bear col-
lected the pot. Luke Malone, driving the old
rattler in those days, used generally to be in
a position to “shout” all round on our
arrival in Braidwood. He knew pretty well
every bear and its location along the road,
for the home-keeping little chap invariably
remains in the one tree for a long period.
* * * *
“Anthony Gloster”: I have never smelt
iodoform in mushrooms (B. 4/8/’27), but
have seen a large yellow fungus, growing on
dead trees in New England (N.S.W.), that
gave off the unpleasant smell. The odor was
so strong it could be winded a quarter of
a mile away. The fungus was the size of a
soup-plate or larger, and of much the same
shape, and had a frilled edge on it.
* * * *
“Kriz”: “Pannikin” may not be an Aus-
tralian word, but the canvas water-bag is
surely Australian. In 1861 John Withnell,
one of North-Westralia’s pioneers, carved out
a home at Roebourne, and while there made
the first canvas water-bag. It consisted of a
square piece of canvas with an eyelet in the
four corners ; to the eyelets pieces of string
were attached and the four brought together.
When water was poured in its weight formed
a belly in the cloth.
* * * *
“Paul C.”: Strange that native animals
affording acceptable dishes for human con-
sumption will not be eaten by dogs. The
bandicoot is tabooed by Towser, as also is
that most edible of all our pouched animals
the kangaroo-rat. This little hopper provides
a meal fit for an epicure. Many people
object to him because of his name, but
he really isn’t a rat at all. He lives mostly
on yams and vegetation, and the flesh is as
white and tender as a chicken’s if it is pro-
perly cooked.
* * * *
“Mullarula”: The abo. word for “no” is
in some cases also the name of the tribe.
With the Waradgery folk in the Lower Lach-
lan district (N.S.W.) the word for “no” is
“werai,” and Werai is an alternative name
for the tribe. Further west, in the language
of the Wonghibon (also known as Wonghi)
tribe, the word used to express “no” or “not”
is “wonghi” ; and the Kamilaroi tribe in the
Coonamble and Walgett districts says
“kamil” for “no.” The same rule may be
observed by other tribes.
CONTRASTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How great it is to ride your horse on a
verdant morn in spring
When he champs his bit and pricks his ears
and moves like a bird a-wing ;
When the duck-flights follow the winding
creeks till they splash in the reed-
fringed dams
And the deep-woolled ewes contented chew-
while they suckle their frisking lambs;
When the six stout horses draw the plough
to the tune of the curlew’s wail
And the lowing cows with their udders full
await their turn at the bail;
When Nature wears her gladdest dress and
smiles on every hand
And upward the bank balance climbs —it’s
Heaven on the land.
But when the dry, dead hand of drought
falls hard on the parching soil
And blazing sun and scorching wind make
harder still the toil
Of cutting scrub for starving beasts, of
shearing dying sheep
In paddocks with a two-stand plant—to
muster they’re too weak—
Of carting water weary miles o’er cracked
and barren ground,
Of coaxing petrol-engined pumps, of all the
weary round
Of work that’s destined to be waste, while
money runs like sand
And upward mounts the overdraft —it’s Hell
upon the land.

THE MAN

PAGE
SEEING A DROUGHT THROUGH.
“C. J.H.”: For five months I have been
watching a station in the throes of drought
feed 40,000 sheep from silage pits. Some ot
these pits are eight years old and all are
turning out well.
This station paid for the silage long before
a pit was opened, through being able to stock
up when there was plenty of grass, hold for
the market and refuse to be beaten down by
the off-shears buyers.
On an average two men did all the work
up to the time of opening the pits. Now it
is taking a dozen men to chop out and spread
the feed; but if labor were scarce the sheep
could be allowed to help themselves from the
pits.
This silage is chiefly wheaten. The aver-
age rainfall is 14 inches, admittedly high for
inland Australia, but a trip through the
eight-inch rainfall country to the west of
Ouyen and Mildura should convince anyone
that with worked fallow wheat can be grown
almost anywhere in Western N. S. Wales.
There are already in Australia wheats suited
to most of our climates, but it. might be
advantageous to import North African seed
for some of our lands.
I have seen 37 bushels per acre coming off
the drier parts of North-Western Victoria;
but for silage it is not necessary to have a
climate suitable for producing grain. The
wheat should be in the pits long before the
grain forms and the shrivelling hot winds
arrive.
I would have been dubious about anyone
being able to grow silage for 40,000 sheep,
because the difficulties are far more than pro-
portionate to those of feeding two or three
thousand.
As for taking sheep to where the tucker
grows, consult those who have tried it and
examine their books. The money which has
beeen spent on relief country added to the
value of the sheep which die in transit would
fallow up a tine crop-paddock.
If all the country in Australia upon
which silage from some crop or another
could be conserved in pits were shown
clearly on the map in i-ed, the uncolored part
of the continent would be chiefly rocks and
stones. Where good grass grows some kind of
valuable crop will thrive, and moisture can
be conserved for drought years. (The lower
the rainfall the better the facilities for con-
servation of moisture in all the parts I
know.)
As for markets. Australia already eats
about 5,000,000 sheep per annum. What
would N.S. vV. consume if carrying
200,000.000 sheep in flocks of from one to
three thousand, with the population of
workers necessary to make all the agricul-
tural machinery and farm fixtures? If we
worked up a fair proportion of our own wool
there would not be much meat available for
export.
'[’wo hundred million sheep! I hear some
folks scoff; but there \pere 55,000,000 last
year in the whole State and only 4| millions
in the Western Division (one-third of the
State and with a far greater proportion of
rich soil than the other two-thirds). Make
the Western Division available, provide water
and communications, and then watch what
the sons of the men who conquered the
Mallee will do with it; but prosecute them
if they let sheep die in millions.
DROUGHT INSURANCE.
“S.V.W.”: “C.J.H.” suggests that the law
should be invoked to “compel” the conser-
vation of fodder on a certain fixed scale.
What would “C.J.H.” suggest when the con-
served fodder on any holding fell below the
required standard through prolonged drought
feeding? Would “C.J.H.” like to see one of
Mr. Lang’s friends commanding a grazier in
a stern voice (borrowed from Mr. Lang)
to dispose of 10,000 sheep because the rain
did not fall at the right time to grow the
oats, thereby leaving 50,000 acres of grass
and fencing to be destroyed by the next bush-
fire? The “compulsion” idea is absurd and
pernicious when power lies in the hands of
professional vote-catching, job-making poli-
ticians.
Nevertheless the writer, who has been for
many years on the sheep job in the drier
parts of N. S. Wales, is convinced that
“0.M.” is far from right when he says:
“Sufficient fodder cannot be grown where the
sheep are.” Much can be done to prevent
great losses over an area which usually
carries three-fourths of this State’s sheep.
If every sheep-run where ensilage-making is
practicable conserved sufficient fodder to feed
its flocks for three months, drought would
lose most of its terrors; agistment would be
much more readily procurable amongst those
who were more fortunate, and in several
other ways the effect would be far-reaching.
This State of N. S. Wales could easily
carry more sheep and grow more wool than
it does. On most runs in the Central dis-
tricts and Far West there is insufficient
water, not enough fencing and little, if any,
attempt at fodder conservation, while many
have a rabbit problem still unsolved. Finance
is, of course, the trouble. When a grazier
has a good year the Taxation Departments
get all they can without allowing any deduc-
tions for reproductive improvements or for
water or fodder conservation. When, if ever,
we get Governments far-sighted enough to
leave untaxed the primary producers and
manufacturers who are willing to put all
they can make back into further production,
then we shall see things done which to-day
are impossible.
SPECIAL DROUGHT-FODDER AREAS.
“Buttenderry”: “C.J.H.’s” query (B.
7/7/’27) “Why should sheep die in mil-
lions?” can be answered by saying that it’s
largely due to “casualness.” Provision
could be made for any normal drought, and
it should be made —on a national basis.
Take N.S.W., for instance. Let the
Federal Government acquire 30,000 acres of
Lachlan flats. This land would require to
bo good lucerne land, level and more or less
naturally graded. The area of such land
in that locality has been variously estimated
at from 500,000 to a million acres, and the
suggested area could probably be secured in
one block, though two or more would do.
Then put a good irrigationist in charge, give
him a free hand and instructions to grow
lucerne and to keep on growing it. If
economy in the working of the plan were
desired, make the show an agricultural col-
lege, charge the students the regular fees
and set them to work. At the end of one,
two or three years of satisfactory labor
give them diplomas, and the chances are
that numbers of them would scatter, over
the country and start small irrigation shows
of their own, which would be all to the
good.
The hay, which would be either stacked
on the spot or baled and distributed in
depots throughout the State, would be suffi-
cient at the end of one year to feed 2,250,000
sheep for a like period, and in five years it
should take care of 11,250.000. Not a
very ambitious scheme, perhaps, for our
55,000,000 jumbucks, but if at the very start
of a drought, before the paddocks got too
trampled, approximately one-fourth —the
lucerne-patch would go on producing—of
our sheep would be put away and hand-fed,
the remaining three-fourths would stand a
much rosier chance of pulling through.
If the Government won’t take the scheme
on, sheep-owners might give it a fly them-
selves, co-operatively. A self-imposed tax
of one penny per head p.a. on their flocks
would, on the present figures, bring in
£230,000 p.a. in N.S.W. That should be
sufficient to give the project a decent kick-
off, and within a very few years put it on
a solid footing.
ENSILAGE PITS.
“Paul C.”: When considering what size
liis ensilage pit should be the farmer’s or
grazier’s first consideration is about the ton-
nage of crop or natural vegetation he has
to conserve. A good general guide in ex-
cavating is to calculate that every cubic yard
of space will hold half a ton of made en-
silage.
A pit 48ft. long by 15ft. wide and 6ft. deep
with perpendicular sides and a slope at each
end of one in three would hold 50 tons of en-
silage. A pit 66ft. long, 20ft. wide and 6ft.
deep with ends and sides as above would
hold 100 tons or slightly over. For the
farmer in a small way a pit that will hold
20 tons would perhaps suit best. Such a pit
could be 48ft. long, Oft. wide and 4ft. deep,
with ends sloped as in the other cases. It
is inadvisable to have a pit deeper than 6ft.,
no matter what its other dimensions, be-
cause of the inconvenience of getting the
ensilage out. Where great quantities of
herbage or crops are to be dealt with, it
is better .to have two or more pits than
a very large one.
When a pit has been filled and built up
about 6ft. above the surface level (as it
always should be) it should be left for
several days to settle. Then it should be
built up again and left for four or five days
and built up finally. Ensilage does a con-
siderable amount of settling, no matter how
well it is packed when being pnt in the pit.
When it is being put in, the team should be
always worked across the stuff as soon as
it gets within a foot of the top. This helps
to compact it and minimise the amount of
settling.
By having more than one pit some may be
filled while the others are compacting, and
the work is not interrupted. Besides, the
advantage of having a number of smaller
pits, when it comes to feeding stock in a
bad time, is obvious.
As to the approximate cost. Two men with
three horses and a plough and scoop could
excavate the largest of the three pits, de-
scribed in 10 days; so it would be a fair
estimate to say that a pit would cost at the
rate of 4s. for each ton of its capacity ; and as
the pits with reasonable care are serviceable
for many years, the cost of their construction
should not deter the farmer or grazier who
has material to fill them, and stock to save in
times of stress.
FODDER FOR SHEEP.
“R.E.” (B. 11/8/’27) is a
very unobservant pessimist. I have seen
oats 4ft. high in the wheel-tracks along roads
in the west of Central Queensland, and any-
one who has seen the Mitchell-grass there
would have no doubt that oats or wheat
w'ould grow luxuriantly. Wheat is very
slightly inferior to oats for silage and is
the hardiest of cereals, coming to maturity
often when the natural pasturage fails.
Crops don’t grow and mature in a day
or two anywhere, so a man will always have
from one to two months for cutting while
the crop is suitable for silage. If “R.E.”
takes his coat off and can work horses he
could do all the work required for pitting
300 acres of silage himself, and care for 3000
sheep as well, but it would pay him to
have an overseas cadet or two and let a
contract for excavation of the pits. I'd give
an average of one-third working time to the
sheep and two-thirds to the silage.
Even at Boulia, “summer fallow"— i.e., 15
months’ fallow —would give him crops. I
have seen a whole district with good crops
of wheat when less than five inches of rain
fell in the growing period (May to Oct.).
In very dry parts it will take two or three
years to store moisture. Good results cannot
be expected from “new ground” unless there
be good rains.
Handling and freight charges would make
carriage of fodder from long distances far
more expensive than silage conservation.
If for any reason it becomes impracticable
to spread the silage, it is only necessary
to open the pit, say an excavation with
three-to-one batters, and the stock will mine
it out for themselves.
GROWING LOCAL CROPS WON’T DO.
“Tiltagoona” : “C. J.H.” : and “Gill Guy”
suggest saving stock in the west of N.S.W.
and Queensland in times of drought by
growing fodder for the purpose. As Nun-
dora stationed is mentioned, the suggestion
evidently extends to the arid Far-Western
districts. I submit that the shortage of rain
precludes making use of the rich land in
the way suggested. In isolated cases it is
quite possible to grow a good crop on some
of the small flats that may be inundated
once in a blue moon, but that is of no use in
feeding large numbers of stock. The only
effort that lias been in the least successful
was that of Robert Leckie, of the Avenue,
40 miles west of Wilcannia, where he has
rich flats in a valley that is occasionally
flooded by water from the Bunker Creek.
But even he has met failure more often than
success, and I think of late years lie has
abandoned the matter of cultivation alto-
gether and, like other Western graziers,
now trusts to Providence.
My remarks, of course apply only to the
dry area and parts where the benefit of the
artesian flow is denied. .Where rain is suf-
ficient more could be done to provide food for
stock than has hitherto been done. Graham
Waddell and A. T. Creswick have been men-
tioned ; but the former’s land is within the
good rain belt, and so is part of Mr. Cres-
wick’s. > When Creswick owned Kilfera
station,’ in the Ivanlioe district, he did not
cultivate extensively, nor does the present
owner of Kilfera, Mr. Chaffey.
CLASSING SMALL CLIPS.
“R. E. Combing”: I can never understand
why so many of our small woolgrowers
tumble their wool into the bale anyhow and
then write down to their brokers and ask
them to get the wool classed in the city.
Sometimes they do take the pieces and bellies
out, and ask for the fleece portion only to be
treated, but in any case it is a mistake.
One supposes that the cocky thinks the
wool can be more expertly done down at .the
city, but once the fleeces are packed in the
bale the yolk in them tends to set harder
and the dust begins to shake through.
Opened up in the dusty city atmosphere, the
bad work is continued. The wool gets a
second-hand shabby look to it and loses its
first brightness. Of course the stuff is not
actually damaged, and it may be more intrin-
sically valuable, but it has lost its first
attractiveness and does not take the buyer’s
eye so well. Also the yield becomes more
questionable and harder to assess.
There is only one place to class wool for
the best commercial benefit, and that is
straight off the sheep’s back and before it
goes into the bale. A bit of amateurish
handling at that stage, backed with some
ordinary commonsense, is worth a great
deal of professional work later on.
COVERING FOR ENSILAGE PITS.
“Paul C.”: In his hints on ensilage-mak-
ing “C.J.11.” said that “the pit must be
air-tight, and in most soils nothing less than
Oft. of earth between the silage and the
air will ensure this.” The second clause calls
for correction. Such a thickness of covering
is not necessary; in my experience a foot
of packed earth is quite sufficient. If that
(ift. advice were followed, an ordinary en-
silage-pit containing 100 tons of silage
would have upwards of 200 tons of earth
on top of it! Think of the business of
scooping this on to it and of scooping it
off again. There is such a thing as having
too much pressure in silage-making.
CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER NEEDS.
“Mullarula” : Cultivation of fodder crops,
conservation of natural growths and a rail-
way system to connect widely-separated dis-
tricts are all worth while as means of reduc-
ing drought losses of stock, but a combina-
tion of the three seems the ideal plan. One
method by itself may, in certain circum-
stances, do harm instead of good. In the
early ’nineties the owners of a well-known
station on the lower Lachlan conserved huge
quantities of grass hay during a good season.
When the inevitable drought arrived neigh-
boring stations, sent their sheep away ro
other districts, but the owners of the hay
kept theirs in their own paddocks and fed
them. Unfortunately the drought lasted
until all the stored fodder was used. By
that time the stock routes were as bare as
a board, and the sheep could not be travelled.
When the drought broke those owners had
become ex-owners of sheep. Their experi-
ence didn’t prove that conservation was un-
wise. If other owners had conserved fodder
in the same way the feed on the stock
routes would have lasted a lot longer. But
they didn’t —and don't.
FOX POISONING.
“Toby C.” : There are more ways than one
of killing foxes. I know a hunter who
collected over 70 skins last winter by pulling
off bunny’s head, dropping strychnine in at
the neck end wdiilst still warm, and leaving
the bait on the trail. Trailing a stale fish
and dropping poisoned suet or caul-fat baits
has often proved successful; the trouble is to
catch the fish. Reynard is fond of fish,
too; some hunters use poisoned sardines.
A fairly reliable method is to poison marrow
bones. The bones are shattered wuth an
axe and strychnine added to the marrow.
This method hardly pays unless cattle are
cheap and foxes plentiful, or on clean-skin
country. Down on Monaro a few years
ago the most popular method was to place
the bait —mostly suet —-in a sawn-off bullock-
horn along a trail made by dragging a
roasted rabbit, ’possum or bird. The horn
was to keep the fox busy at the bait until
the tonic commenced to work on his innards.
A poisoned parrot, partly buried—only the
tail-feathers showing—is another w r ay of
getting Flossie her fox-skin choker. In all
the above methods a little pinch of baking-
powder adds piquancy to the bait. In every
case the bait should be handled as little as
possible and the trail draw r n from the saddle.
WANTED—A RATION TABLE.
“Prop.” : What the pastoralist wants most
just now is a simple table showing what
feed, combined with the roughage in the pad-
dock, will make a suitable ration for a sheep.
Maize, being cheap, is the main staple, but
maize by itself, if fed over a long period, is
wasteful. The sheep pass in their excreta
big quantities of valuable foodstuffs, be-
cause those foods that should combine w r ith
the maize to make a digestible ration are
lacking. That’s only one instance of the
diet difficulty.
I know there are all sorts of bulletins that
deal with proteins, vitamines, carbo-hydrates
and other chemists’ terms, but that isn't
w 7 hat the pastoralist w r ants. Especially the
small man. What I, for example. w 7 ant to
know is : What shall I buy to combine with,
say, maize and dry herbage ; maize and dry
grass; maize and bare paddock; maize and
scrub and a little dry grass? Substitute
wiieat or lucerne for maize, and give me a
table dealing with all three staples, and in
each instance state whether a lick is re-
quired, and of what it should consist, and
I’ll know something. If a bit of accurate in-
formation were thrown in as to the food value
of proprietary mixtures it w:ould be all to
the good.
THE CLOD THEORY.
“Five Furrows”: If Peacock’s rough
ploughing method, or the “clod theory,” is
suitable for seeding on granite or heavy soil,

Trade with the Empire”
IS it a phrase and no more ? Is it just sentimentality, a
mere political shibboleth ? It is not. On every ground
of common-sense, of good business and of sound economics,
Empire Trade is amply justified. In the long view, it is even
worth some sacrifice to keep trade within the Empire.
Where no sacrifice is needed, where quality and price are
competitive it is sheer bad business to allow trade to go outside
the Empire.
Armstrong Whitworth desire no sacrifice in asking for your
orders. Their activities cover the whole field of engineering.
They will equip a harbour, or provide a single crane. They
will construct your locomotives, or a fleet of ships, or supply
a farmhouse with electric lighting plant. Raw material and
finished product, VIBRAC Steel, Brass Rod, Twist Drills,
Water Turbines and so on down an unending list of
engineering products.
Every Armstrong Whitworth product represents the maximum
in value. Its quality is always of the highest.
As a great Empire firm, therefore, we seek your order:.

as “Prop” says (B. 11/8/’27), can any
reader say if this method has been success-
fully tried for sowing lucerne on granite soil?
It has always been understood that deep
ploughing and a fine tilth is essential for the
sowiug and the germination of this seed.
If the clod theory would be practicable for
lucerne sowing, then the problem of cultivat-
ing ground where the saffron-thistle abounds
might be solved, as, once the soil is turned
over with deep ploughing, the saffron might
not come up again; but ploughing and
harrowing perhaps three times to bring the
ground to a fine tilth really seems to propa-
gate the pest, which, by the way, is taking
heavier toll year by year.
SMALL FAMILIES AND SMALLER
STOCK.
“Jumbuck”: Small families have revolu-
tionised the demand for stock. The heavy
crossbred wether of GOlb. to 701 b. is not the
attraction it was. The 481 b. to 501 b. wether
or the 301 b. to 351 b. lamb is what the butcher
wants. The same applies to beef. The
prime young bullock or steer or the well-
grown calf meets present-day requirements
far better than the massive mountain, which
used to be the aim and pride of cattlemen.
This is part of the reason why South Ameri-
can meat gets ahead of Australian abroad.
The South American producer is catering
for the world's requirements in a more under-
standing fashion than his Australian com-
petitor.
CURING CROP-BOUND CHICKENS.
“Country Ped.”: In the spring growing
chickens are liable to become crop-bound,
the craw filling up with a mass of indigest-
ible fibres of grass and straw from the pens.
If the bird is examined the craw will be
found tight and hard. A spoonful of salad
oil poured in. and the mass kneaded in the
fingers, occasionally effects a cure, but only
in the early stages. In bad cases —and most
of them are bad, since the bird is not seen
to be ill until it can’t eat any more—the
best plan is to sterilise an old safety-razor
blade by well boiling. Pluck the feathers
off a square inch of breast, and then make
a quick incision about an inch long. Squeeze
the fibres out through the incision, or, if this
fs not possible, eject the mass with a tea-
spoon, well sterilised. Then wash the craw
out with warm wmter, and stitch up the
wound with a sterilised needle and some
white cotton. There are two walls to the
craw, an inner and an outer. Stitch the
inner wall incision together first, and then
close up the cut in the skiu. If you don’t,
the chicken will die. Then coop the doc-
tored bird away from other fowls, and feed
on breadcrumbs soaked in milk, followed by
boiled rice, until its former healthy look
reappears.
ANOTHER POSSIBLE COMPETITOR.
“Wool Away”: South Africa is butting
into our fine-wool trade, Italy is making
artificial wool out of cotton, and the latest
threat levelled at our monopoly comes from
China. China contributes quite a lot of
wool to the world’s markets. Her share is
about one-twelfth of the entire output. With
Thibet, whose trade she handles, she runs
some 70-million sheep. The severe winters
ensure a long fleece, and generally it is
of very fair quality.. There are vast grazing
areas in Mongolia which, if utilised, as they
will be some day, can support twice 70-
million sheep.
At present Chinese methods of marketing
handicap the product. Growers bale wool
indiscriminately with goat- and camel-hair in
many cases, with a result that may be im-
agined. But the Chinaman is a good sheep-
man, as those who remember the fine work
he did as a shepherd in the early days of the
Darling Downs will admit. He is reaching
out in many directions which have been
closed to him in the past, and is adapting
himself to European methods of organisation
and marketing.
Those who are confident that Australia's
supremacy in the world’s wool trade can
never be challenged might do worse than take
into consideration the Chinese sheepgrowers’
possibilities, coupled with the new urge
in China to modernisation and the vast field
of cheap labor available there. We can
easily be too confident, and therefore too
careless.
DRAWBACKS OF CAPONISING.
“Te Hipi”: Caponising has been tried in
Maoriland and found wanting. The birds
are all “Mrs. Lance Rawson” says in flavor
and size (B. 7/7/’27), but the trouble and
expense involved soon put a damper on the
business. The capon, by reason of the
operation, is put back several weeks in con-
dition, and although eventually growing
bigger than the cockerel, he takes longer to
get right for market.
And where is your market when you
have him fat? Unless you have guaranteed
customers you will come a thud, as the
public in Australia and M.L. has not yet
shown itself keen on the capon, excellent
eating though it is.
FIVE LAMBS AT A BIRTH.
“Te Hiki”: Is this a record? A week or
two ago a Romney-Lincoln crossbred ewe
in the Waikato (M.L.) gave birth to five
lambs. Although a bit on the small side
all of them are doing well. Three of them
have to be hand-reared, needless to s,4y.
SCARING THE CROWS./
“J.G.”: As a last resort, after poisoning
had failed to get rid of egg-stealing crows, I
got an old rabbit-trap and tied a piece of
meat firmly to the plate of the firap. Then
I set the trap upon a crosspiece nailed to
the top of a pole stuck in one of the hay-
stacks. After catching and killing two
crows I left a third one makng a great
song about it in the trap. Very soon what
looked like the whole crow population this
side of the equator was flying, and screaming
around the fluttering captive. After a while
I released the prisoner, and let it go. It
made a bee-line for Oodnadatta, I think,
and all the others followed.) We had not a
crow near our place for weeks afterwards;
and when they did come back again I caught
two or three more. The mob evidently
thought that there was something wrong
about our place, and they cleared out again,
leaving us alone for months.
POTATOES IN QUEENSLAND.
“Bad Australian”: Tell “Ikey Ironbark”
(B. 11/S/’27) that potato crops such as
that cited by “Woodside” are not regarded
as miraculous in Victoria or Tassy. He
gives seven tons per acre as the best crop
ever grown in his district (South Burnett,
Q.) on deep scrub soil of volcanic origin,
capable of growing maize and other crops
to perfection, and lie asks: Why not more
potatoes? Ask a Bungaree or Circular
Head spud propagator why he doesn’t go in
for sugar-cane instead of potatoes and he
will tell you that the climate is not suit-
able. There are some patches of fine land
on the Burnett, but any land so far north
would need to be at an elevation of at least
3000 ft. above sea-level before it could
reasonably be expected to grow potatoes
similar in quantity and quality to' those of
Southern Victoria or the North Coast of
Tasmania.
BABY BEEF.
“FY7”: It is becoming more and more
evident that the trend of modern beef
production is in the direction of get-
ting the beast ready for market as
soon as possible. The eaters of beef
who once asked for matured meat from stock
at least four years old now insist on cuts
from cattle not more than eighteen months
old—what the Americans, who created the
fashion, call baby beef. To the forcing-on
involved in producing this class of meat must
be added the modern necessity for breeding
cattle with as much of the “fine cuts” as
possible. The day has gone when a bullock
could be bred with profit on the “prime all
over” plan. The buyer now is inclined to
look only for the beast in which rib, loin and
thighs are prominent, and the unprofitable
neck and fore end negligible. Those re-
quirements can be easily enough met by
British and American breeders, whose cattle
nowadays may be fairly said to come into
the hand-fed class. Even in the Argentine
intensive lucerne and other feeding is now
generally employed in forcing forward the
young stock. The saving in time otherwise
wasted in waiting for profit and the lessen-
ing of cost in upkeep are too evident to re-
quire comment.
Whether the system can be applied to the
conditions which govern the greater propor-
tion of this country’s beef production is
another matter. In the southern States,
where beef-growing is now conducted on
comparatively small areas, the cattlemen
should be able to adapt themselves to the
new demand. On the great cattle-runs of
Queensland and the Northern Territory
conditions are different. There the only
system possible is the breeding of “stores”
to four years old and the despatch of
them, mostly on the hoof, to fattening areas
close to the killing works, where they
can be topped up, Australian sheepbreeders
have learned to reduce the size of their
paddocks and their flocks, with a correspond-
ing improvement in wool and mutton quality.
The Australian beef-man may find a way
out of his afflictions by the same route.
KILLING THE PRICKLY-PEAR.
“Wolfang”: Queensland, which has ex-
perimented with many queer creatures in
its campaign against prickly-pear, is con-
vinced that it has struck a winner in the cac-
tablastus caterpillar. He’s a quick worker,
and attacks the pear by eating his way
through the stem of the leaf, where it joins
with the other segments of the plant.
The caterpillar leaves behind it a gummy
substance which seems to have high toxic
qualities, for the whole plant affected sub-
sequently dies, apparently from the absorp-
tion of this substance. It is hoped that
this gummy matter, which is found in
the dead pear in large quantities, and is
easily collected, may be used for the manu-
facture of a toxin which could be employed
with better effect than the chemical poisons
already in use.
Farm hints.
“Kayeff”: Cincturing to increase plant
yield is practised by John Chinaman. His
method is to split the stem as near the
ground as possible and insert a wooden
wedge to keep the two halves apart; I have
seen the stunt worked mostly on guava
beans and the various marrow-like fruits
of which the Chinese are so fond.
“Yufu”: Here’s a simple way of telling
a cow’s age. Count the rings on one horn
and add three. In the case of youngsters,
peeling horns mean two years ; clean horns,
three; one ring, four. Some cattlemen hold
that climate makes a difference, cattle in cold
climates having clean horns in two years.
But I have never found this so.
“Carisbrook, Jun.”: When tanning mar-
supial skins all useless pieces of skin, meat
and fat are removed. The skins are then
soaked in warm salt water for a couple of
hours. Then apply a coating of about one
ounce of borax and saltpetre, dissolved into
a paste. Next day give the skins a coat-
ing of a mixture of 2oz. salactic soda, 3oz.
borax and 4oz. hard soap, which should be
'warmed. The skins should then be folded
up and left in a warm place to dry. A
day or so later dissolve 4oz. alum, 3oz. salt
and 2oz. saleratus in hot water, and when
cool soak the skins for 12 hours. After
they are wrung out, hang up and allow' to
dry.
“Allambee”: There is evidence that cinc-
turing weakens the disease-resisting powers
of apple-trees that are inclined to run to
wood. I saw a young Jonathan tree that
had a main limb cracked during ploughing,
and the broken limb was bound back in its
place with string. When the tree came
into bearing there was more fruit on the
bound-up limb than on the others; but the
limb was stunted, and the usual vigorous
growth of the Jonathan laterals was entirely
absent, the fruit growing on short spurs.
Woolly-aphis was, however, particularly bad
in the limb —it had much more than the
average of the orchard.

1. Be careful to sit on the near side of the

narrow shaves on the off side. Also, as the driver
mostly drives on the wrong side of the road, you
will have the upper berth when capsizing.
2. Do not ask the driver if he isn’t driving
rather fast—that is, not unless you are in a very
great hurry.
3. Do not tell the driver that a tyre has blown

like it mentioned until after the accident.
4. If your false teeth get jerked out, wait until
all the other passengers have alighted before you
search for them on the floor: you may happen on a
more expensive set.
5. If you smell fire do not mention it. You will
give less offence and produce as good a result by
applying a lighted match to the driver’s coat, behind.
Then he will believe you.
6. If you perceive that a head-on collision is
imminent, sit back. You will thus be further away
from the accident.

A BOY’S FESTERED KNEE.
“My little boy fell and cut his knee terribly.
Although I tried almost everything, the sore
remained in fearful condition. A friend advised
Zam-Buk. This balm caused the healing to pro-
gress rapidly and soon put the child right again.”
Mrs. E. Bean, 68 Halifax Street, Adelaide.
BURNS AND SCALDS.
“Through upsetting the
kettle, my hand and wrist
were badly scalded. Big
blisters formed and broke,
leaving a mass of painful, raw
flesh. Zam-Buk took out all
‘heat’ and pain ; it caused
inflammation to subside and
new tissue to grow. Zam-Buk
healed without leaving a trace
of the injuries.”—Mrs. F.
Phillips, Cecil Cottage,
Logan Road, S.E. Brisbane.
POISONED WOUNDS.
“I knocked my ankle against
an iron fender. Dye from my
stocking got into the sore
place, causing serious inflam-
mation and ulceration. I was
laid up for weeks in awful
pain. However, Zam-Buk
proved most soothing. It
drew out all corruption,
allayed inflammation and
soon healed the wound.”—■

Street, Darlinghurst, Sydney.

“NINETY-NINE per cent, of cases of
septic poisoning arise through neglect
of trifling cuts and scratches,” says a big
works manager.
Whether for accidents at home or at work Zam-Buk
is the ideal safety-first healer. Prompt application of a
little Zam-Buk to any cut, scratch, burn or abrasion, pre->
vents poisonous germs from infecting broken tissues.
Zam-Buk is the safety-first healer because it acts on the skin
in three ways. It at once soothes and allays inflammation and
swelling. It relieves pain and checks bleeding almost immediately.
Secondly, Zam-Buk is a splendid antiseptic; it kills and excludes
disease germs and averts or checks blood-poison. Finally, Zam-Buk
heals swiftly and naturally by promoting growth of new, healthy
skin.
If the sore place be blistered and inflamed (as in a burn or
scald), spread Zam-Buk on a piece of lint or clean rag.
Zam-Buk owes its exceptional healing virtues to its rare
herbal character, its refinement and its absolute freedom from the
animal fats and mineral drugs found in ordinary ointments and
salves.
Be sure and keep a box of this safety-first healer always
handy.

Defeat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
iT was night when Rose began her prepara-
tions. She had an hour to herself before
Carl called; at midnight she would be at
sea into the peace of a clean world.
Beace! She wanted peace, fresh faces,
fresh scenes; new garments to replace the
threadbare things she wore. She wanted
respite from poverty and squalor and
struggle.
From her window she could see Carl’s
ship which was to take her to strange and
wonderful places—China, ’Frisco, the Argen-
tine, London, the Baltic. It was a wind-
jammer, a beautiful, bird-like vessel, all masts
and rigging. It lay there, still yet vital,
conveying to her jaded city soul a promise
of freedom and high adventure.
The night was hushed, a little tremulous,
as if all its delicate beauty lay quivering and
repressed. Lights ringed the bay, warming
its still depths. A ferry-boat glided by
without effort, the red light amidships splash-
ing a trail of blood' across the water. Such
evenings were never without their appeal to
her, however tired were her body and mind.
And to-night it was pleasant to think of the
fresh wind that would be blowing outside
the Heads ; of the Lucia plunging north to
China.
It puzzled her, this passionate love of the
sea. Neither on her father’s nor her mother’s
side could it be explained. She could only
assume that after a sweaty day in the cafe,
where she worked amidst dishes and food,
the thought of gales and seas acted upon her
mind as thoughts of clear, running streams
on the imagination of a thirsty man. Then
the uniqueness of eloping—though it was
hardly that—with the first-officer of a sailing
ship fed the romance that had come to her
starved soul. That sense of romance, she
reflected, had come near to extinction; she
had felt it drying within her, an inexorable
contraction of her soul, all the more tragic
because she herself was strangling it.
How she had got into the habit of thinking
in a manner different from the others of her
class Rose could not explain. She never
remembered her father or mother thinking of
much beyond debts and work and sleep.
Nor had any of the girls with whom she
worked her vigorous sense of revolt. They
were pretty, they had their boys and —she
had seen it times out of number—when the
routine of work became intolerable they
married. Sneers at marriage were rather
cheap, but Rose could not recall one of her
workmates who had become prettier or who
had attained by that path the freedom she
sought. Still, it was strange that it never
occurred to them to auestion the inevitability
which made their lives a round of worry and
work.
True, there were a few who rebelled. She
well remembered Madge Soutar’s words to her
one evening:
“The same thing every
day and every night. It
makes me sick coming
home to this damned
room. It’s enough to
send a girl on the
streets.”
Finally she went on the
streets.
Rose wondered whether that was the sig-
nificance of life for girls like her —to fight
miserably or to submit.
People talked about ' spirituality. She
could tell them that spirituality was not
a companion of squalor; it was possible
only where life was clean and comfortable.
Where men worked hard, got dirty, there was
little time for the higher things. She could
not, for example, associate spirituality with
Battler; the idea was laughable, yet, crude
though it was, his affection for her stood
every test of sincerity.
And then, in a flash, in her room waiting
for Carl, she knew that it was not the cafe
she was flying from; it was Battler. She
knew now that his intention to marry her
was to her imagination something terrifying
and inescapable, something that would, unless
she did as Madge Soutar did, hold her fast
to her wretched environment; make her old;
make her resigned.
Battler was a pugilist. In the boxing
world he was a star, and there was one tri-
bute which even his enemies did not begrudge
him—he never quitted. He had that stark,
animal courage which sustains some men
while there is breath left in their bodies.
And, rather terribly, he was rising that
tenacity to make her marry him. She had
refused him more than once. “I’ll get her
all right.” The boast came back as it was
intended to, and though she tried to laugh it
off it frightened her.
Then Battler took lodgings in the house
where she stayed. Every evening about ton
o’clock he passed her room, walking heavily,
deliberately, until even in her sleep she heard
his footsteps as though they were trampling
over her body, crushing her into submission.
When she saw him she nodded frigidly, never
revealing the fear clutching at her heart;
he gave back a slow grin. Somehow his pur-
suit reminded her of an account of one of his
fights: Battler, bleeding but strong, ever
pressing his man, weakening him with short,
well-calculated blows. The other, more bril-
liant, faster, slowly crumpling before his
relentless attack.
Rose turned from the window. She shook
her head as if to dispel unpleasant thoughts.
There was nothing to fear now; soon she
would be out of it for good; away from the
slums and the struggle.
She regarded the coming of Carl as a
rescue. It was as if she had been drowning
and he had saved her. Just in time ! She
had begun to feel like that crumpling fighter
with glazed eyes and dipping knees. By sheer
force of will Battler was breaking down her
defences, weakening her by his grim per-
sistency. If she had not met Carl soon there
would have been nothing for it but marriage
with Battler, or an alternative of which she
did not like to think.
Rose looked at herself in the glass. She
was curious to know what it was in her that
attracted Carl. She was of medium height
and pretty, yet no prettier than hundreds of
other girls one saw in the streets every day.
But her eyes were a deep grey beneath dark
lashes and jet hair, and they mirrored the
wistful longing for something better that
possessed her.
Her case lay upon the bed, and she put
into it a few pairs of woollen stockings pur-
chased that day; it would be cold at sea
and she would need warm clothing. Her
packing was practically finished. She glanced
at the clock. Quarter-past nine. She expected
Carl at half-past, though it was possible that
he would be' a bit late. It thrilled her to
think that when the hour struck she would
be with Carl in the launch that was to take
them to the Lucia in mid-stream. Her heart
was very full just then.
It was wonderful the confidence she had in
Carl. He was Norwegian, about 35 years of
age, fair, and it was evident that he was
madly in love with her. The homage he
paid permitted no other construction, for dur-
ing the month his beat had been in port he
had never eased in his attentions. He met
her every evening, always taking her to a
theatre or to a show of some sort. His regard
for her was so clean, so entirely unique in her
experience that, despite his greater age, she
HE’D MERELY TRIED TO LIVE UP TO HER.
“No, I cannot for give you for lying to me.”
“But, darling, the truth isn’t good enough for you.”
began to feel for him something of the love
lie had for her.
Now that she had committed her life to
Carl she did not feel any misgiving. They
were to be married at sea by the captain,
who was his brother. She had no fear that
he would “double-cross” her. He was too
fine for that; too obviously in love.
Ten minutes left! She decided to occupy
the time by writing a letter to Spiro, the
proprietor of the cafe, telling him that she
had left. She repressed a desire to give
Spiro a piece of her mind for some trifling
affront earlier in the day.
* * * *
Ten o’clock struck and Carl had not come.
Rose wondered what was keeping him. She
opened the door, peering into the passage
to see if he was below. He would come
any minute!
It occurred to her that, after all, he might
not come. She dismissed the thought with
a sort of grimness. No fear of that. Going
to the table she strapped her case.
Footsteps in the little hall below... . Some-
one coming up the stairs! It was Carl!
She ran to the door. But in an instant she
knew those steps, heavy, deliberate, and,
hearing them now instead of her lover’s, she
was filled with nameless dread.
“Someone walking over my grave.” She
had heard girls use the expression when
they shivered, and, in a moment of hysteria,
she imagined Battler trampling over the
grave of her hopes and romance. Hatred
possessing her, she slammed the door with
a violence that seemed to rock the room. He
laughed quietly as he went by.
She set her jaw. Premonition! There
was no such thing! “He will come any
minute.” She repeated the formula to her-
self once, twice, many times. She prayed,
a thing she had nearly forgotten to do;
prayed that Carl would come and take her
away.
And then she remembered that she could
see the Lucia from the window. She pulled
the curtain aside. Something leaped at her
heart, numbing her brain, paralysing her
hopes. The Lucia had gone. The bay was
empty. “O God!” she cried. And from
somewhere in the harbor a siren screamed
cruelly.
There was a knock upon the door. She
knew it was not Carl, he would have entered,
vet her body shook all over. Something
white showed under the door. She heard
uneven steps as a boy made his way down
the steps. , , , . ,
It was a contemptible little letter. He felt
too ashamed to face her, he said. After con-
sideration, he did not think it was fair nor
honorable to ask her to leave her country
for him ; she could not know how impossible
were the privations she would have to face.
Loving her as he did”—
She tore the letter to pieces and, in a
rage, threw them upon the floor. Damn the
unfairness ! Damn his honor! Damn his
regret! Again the siren shrieked and then
moaned into silence. The scattered white
shreds at her feet, the silent, deserted bay
were the mute relics of her romance.
The door opened. She saw Battler on the
threshold. His appearance there came as a
blow across her heart, which was throbbing
with a dull, heavy pain. Again a vision
of that crumpling fighter!.... She was
crumpling herself, broken and beaten! _ A
feeling of the utter senselessness of things
swept over her. It was no use! All was
futility!
“Come in. Battler,” she said....and she
forced a smile.

Woo Loo’s Canaries.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ci HUNG YEN was a fortune-teller and
t a vagabond, and when, for forty cash,
he had told Woo Loo’s fortune, he had
also, he considered, driven a very long nail
into Woo Loo’s coffin. Thinking it over
after Woo had departed, Chung wondered if
he had not gone just a little bit too far —
just that little bit which would make Woo
suspicious. For Woo was very wily. “Great
wealth will be yours,” he had told Woo.
“I can see it waving in the fields over all
the country. With the prohibition against
opium comes hemp, the wonderful Indian
hemp with a heaven in every mouthful.
Through your hands the seed will pass, each
seed as a grain of gold. Go! Take fortune
while it is at the tide, and all will come
out as I say.”
Had he said just too much and made Woo
suspicious, or just sufficient to awaken
within him the spirit of avarice? There
was bad blood between Chung and Woo, and
if, in the face of the prohibition against
opium, Chung could induce Woo to smuggle
in tlie seed of the Indian hemp, the rest
would be easy. A surreptitious word to the
mandarin and old scores against Woo would
be wiped out. And Woo Loo could do it.
As undisputed king of the waterfront from
Canton to Peking, he could import the stuff
without raising the slightest suspicion.
Chung Yen went to sleep that night with
a smile on his face. Put it was as nothing
to the smile on the face of Woo Loo as lie
sat far into the night chewing opium-ash
arid thinking:.
By chance, or design, Chung Yen was
Woo's first customer, and along with the
seed he sold him Woo handed Chung a
surprise. “Three tael for the see.d, and
three tael for the canary,” said Woo blandly,
thrusting his hand into a cageful of the
fluttering birds.
Chung hesitated. In his wildest flights of
fancy lie had never included canaries in
his scheme of vengeance against Woo.
“As canary seed this stuff is coming in,”
explained Woo. “But for the canaries would
the authorities become suspicious. Take the
bird or leave tlie seed.”
Marvelling at Woo’s cunning, Chung took
his canary.
Through a thousand secret news-chan-
nels the news quickly spread. Chung saw
to it that it did spread. “Buy a canary
and grow hemp!” became a province-wide
expression. Inside a month canaries were
everywhere. Never had Ilunnan seen so
many canaries. Birds there had always
been. From time immemorial old men who
should have known better had daily taken
their caged birds for walks, communing with
the spirits of departed ancestors to the sing-
ing of their feathered companions. But this
canary invasion was different. The birds
were everywhere. They swung in their
cages in the doorway of every home. Shop-
keepers who had bought seed on the share
system with small landholders exhibited
them on their counters. They twitted on
the pole-ends of the basket coolies, and some
men, fancifully connecting the canary with
the seed, gave it honored place on one of
the fence posts surrounding the crop. Even
the water-dwellers, fearing the deprivation
of their opiate, bought and planted the seed
in pots, hanging the canary cage where it
would bring best luck to the expected
harvest.
Surprised and delighted at the manner in
which his subjects had accepted the ban
upon the poppy, the mandarin encouraged
their new-found love of birds by going, in
person to purchase a pair of Woo Loo,
carrying them, openly and unabashed,
through the streets back to his yamen.
Never before had such a thing been heard
of.
And they were all good canaries. The
securing of such a huge supply had cost Woo
Loo many anxious moments. But there is a
limit even to the supply of canaries, and
with the end of his stock in sight Woo buried
his abundance of money one very dark night
and awaited developments.
But Chung Yen could not wait. To the
revengeful the essence of vengeance is the
swiftness of its fall. Your true feudist
can wait half a lifetime and still find ven-
geance sweet. But to the amateur revenge
must be swift or lose its flavor. And Chung
was an amateur. Had he been otherwise
he would have awaited the ripening of the
crops before approaching the mandarin.
But he didn’t wait. He couldn’t wait. The
maggot of vengeance which consumed him
brooked no delay, and Woo Loo had hardly
disposed of his last pound of the precious
seed and his last canary when the yellow
hand of the law descended upon him.
Woo’s arrest and trial caused a sensation.
Being both fancifully and financially inter-
ested, the district for miles round attended.
But it is difficult for the most painstaking
magistrate to secure a conviction in a land
where the prisoner must first confess his
guilt, and this Woo flatly refused to do.
“It was good canary seed,” maintained
Woo. “Most excellent seed, direct from
the Canary Islands. At three tael the pound
I lost money, averting complete disaster only
by the sale of the birds, which, by the inter-
vention of Buddha, I was able to buy cheap.
Because a man,” he continued, casting a
meaning glance at Chung Yen, “begrudges
the money he spends on food for his bird is
no reason why I should be punished.”
It was a most excellent argument; an
argument which could not be refuted until
the crops ripened, and in adjourning the
case until after the harvest the magistrate
took occasion to warn Chung Yen of the
consequences of bearing false witness against
one’s neighbor.
* * * *
Woo Loo was never re-tried. From his
famous seed Hunnan raised its first crop of
canary seed, a most excellent crop showing
not a single stalk of hemp. And while Chung
Yen to-day sits on the corner of the Street
of Perdition, his neck encased in the cangue,
the great wooden collar of the law, Woo, in
far-away Peking, sits chewing opium-ash and
dating his return against the time when
Hunnan’s canaries will have consumed the
last of his excellent canary seed.

What are the wages in Queensland for
work on sugar plantations? Are there any
openings? ,To whom should I apply? —l3o4.
Wages and conditions in the industry are
regulated by an industrial award. In the
mills the wages range from 2s. OJd. per hour
for lowest-paid class of work in the south-
ern district to 2s. Bd. per hour for the,
highest-paid class of work in the northern
district. At this time of the year the field
work is mostly cane-cutting and harvesting,
and is done at per ton; workers make up to
£8 or £lO p.w. For those on wages the
rate is £4 ss. p.w. in the south and £4 13s.
in the _ north. The official report is that
just prior to the industrial crisis there was
a surplus of labor offering in all the dis-
tricts.
I am a small N.B.W. contractor in con-
stant employment. Which would you advise
—get a car on the usual terms or on the
cash-order system ? —llB6.
The only firm in Sydney that advertises
itself as in the cash-order motor business
finances dealers and not individual buyers.
The cheapest way to buy a car is to pay all
cash : the next cheapest is to pay as much as
possible and take as short a time as can
possibly be arranged for the balance. The
most expensive way is to pay as little cash
as the seller will accept and to take the
longest time he will permit to pay the
balance.
(1) How can I get a thorough training in
journalism for a daughter? (2) What is a
newspaper cadet? (3) Is it necessary to
have passed the Intermediate exam.? —l37B.
(1) By obtaining her a- position on the
staff of a newspaper. Openings, however,
occur seldom, and the next best plan is to
engage in freelance journalism while pur-
suing another calling. If marked ability is
displayed in this field a staff job won’t be hard
to get. (2) A cadet is a person who is in
training for journalism and (under the latest
awards) has had less than three years at
newspaper work. (3) Only one Sydney
morning paper insists upon it.
llow can I become a member of some
literary club such as the Playbox? —-1312.
The Playbox is a dramatic society. Its
subscription is £1 Is. per annum, and appli-
cation for membership should be made to the
sec., 11 Rowe-street, Sydney. Other such
societies are the Sydney Repertory (15 Bligh-
street) and the Players’ Club (N. J. Shields.
195 Elizabeth-street).
I am a N.B.W. storekeeper and employ my
wife at a fixed weekly wage to work in my
shop. Do I have to insure her under the
Workers’ Compensation Act? —l4oo.
Workers’ Compensation Commission ad-
vises that this is a technical point still under
consideration by the Crown Solicitor. Write
to the Commission at Winchcombe House,
Bridge-street, Sydney, and ask it to let you
know the Crown Solicitor’s decision as soon
as it is available.
How would my son set out to become a
dentist in N.5.W.t— 1303 .
Through either the Uni. or the Dental
Board. As regards the Uni. he must matricu-
late in English, mathematics, Latin, French
and possibly chemistry. This would qualify
him for admission to the dental college,
where he would spend four years. During
this period he would require to pass exams,
in anatomy, physiology, dental metallurgy,
and finally an exam, in the various branches
of dental science. If he intends to be inden-
tured to a dentist for four years he would
pass the Dental Board exam, in English,
mathematics, Latin and chemistry at the
higher standard of the Leaving Certificate.
Having done this he would be qualified to
enter, into indentures, during which period
he would require to pass exams, similar to
those mentioned above. For further infor-
mation see Registrar. N.S.W. Dental Board,
Chief Secretary’s office, Macquarie-street.
Are there any N.B.W. scholarships avail-
able for a girl of 15 who will be sitting for
the leaving certificate in 1928?—1206.
It is open for the girl to compete at the
leaving-certificate examination, (a) for
an exhibition admitting to University
courses without payment of fees, (b) for a
scholarship admitting to the Teachers’ Col-
lege which is non-residential, and (c) for
a residential scholarship at the Women’s
College (application for this should be made
to the principal). She may also compete
for a scholarship in the Home Economics
course at the East Sydney Technical College.
Write to the Education Department in 12
months’ time ; some changes may have been
made in the conditions.
(1) Is carbon tetrachloride in capsule
form made up in doses suitable for four-
tooth to aged wethers? Also price? (2) Is it.
preferable to administer through funnel or
with forceps? (3) Is carbon tetrachloride
put up ready mixed with medicinal paraffin
oil? (4) Is carbon tetrachloride equally as
efficacious as arsenic as a drench for stomach
or nodule worms in sheep? (5) For what
period should sheep be held off feed and
tea ter before and after drenching? —l3Bo.
(1) Put up by Park, Davis and Co., and
on sale at most chemists; 9s. per 100.
(2) Administer with forceps or a small
balling-gun. (3) The drug in paraffin oil
can be obtained from any chemist —ask for
1 c.c. carbon tet. to 4 c.c. paraffin oil, and
given with a small syringe. The oily mix-
ture won’t run satisfactorily through a
drenching-funnel. The cost is a shilling or
two cheaper than capsules per 100. (4)
Carbon tet. is not effective against any
other parasite than fluke. (5) Sheep do not
need yarding before the drug is administered,
and can be liberated soon after.
lloio do I (1) take a mortgage on real
estate? (2) Take a bill-of-sale over a
client’s furniture as security for money lent?
—ll3l.
(1) If under the R.P. (Torrens) Act,
obtain the certificate of title from the mort-
gagor and hand it to your solicitor to draw
up mortgage. lie will make any searches
necessary, draft the memorandum and see to
registration, etc. His costs are fixed by
scale and are a charge against the mortgagor.
(2) Supply necessary details to your soli-
citor and instruct him to draw up the instru-
ment, a copy of which must be registered
within 30 days. In this case also the bor-
rower pays tbc costs. The position is that
the lender of the money requires sound
security for its repayment, and proof of
soundness must he furnished by the borrower
free of cost to the lender. Inform the bor-
rower to this effect if he is not aware of it.

hall or their representatives, in this case
the committee, are apparently liable, unless
they can show that when they permitted the
performance they were not aware, and had

and economical.

Every motor and every other part
of every General Motors car is
constantly studied by 1000
engineering experts whose purpose
is continuous improvement.
r*'
Before its public introduction,
every new General Motors car
model is driven thousands of miles
over every conceivable road and
grade under scientific observation
at the General Motors Proving
Ground.
Wkat is General Motors ?
General motors owns the
manufacturing companies
which make the Chevrolet,
Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Oakland, La
Salle, Buick, Cadillac, and Vaux-
hall motor cars.
In addition to these cars, the
General Motors list also includes
Chevrolet and G.M.C. trucks.
In the General Motors group is a car
for every purse and purpose. Each is
built complete in a General Motors fac-
tory. Each is a better car and a more
economical car, because each factory
profits by the experience of all the others,
each shares in the economies resulting
from General Motors great volume of
purchases ; each uses the developments
of the great General Motors Research
Laboratories ; each uses the General Mo-
tors Proving Ground —at only a fraction
of the total cost —because it is part of
General Motors.
Many of your friends are owners of
General Motors cars. Australian busi-
ness men are General Motors dealers —
who serve you and bring you greater
value for your money—because they are
General Motors dealers. Australian men
and women are employed in the five
General Motors plants in Australia, and
still others are employed by dealers.
General Motors also purchases largely
from Australian manufacturers, who, in
turn, directly and indirectly, give em-
ployment to many thousands of people.
General Motors increases business for
Australian banks, Australian railroads
and steamship companies.
Every General Motors plant— every
individual General Motors dealer— every
individual car buyer—profits by the very
size of General Motors because he
shares in the economies made possible
by its size.
General Motors has grown to be the
largest organization of its kind in the
world, solely because of the fact that it
has won the confidence of millions of
customers all over the world.
And back of it all, and because of it all,
General Motors makes it an advantage
to you to own a General Motors car—by
giving you greater value and finer
quality than could be possible if it were
not for the very fact that General Motors
is so large.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Gothic gave Sydney a taste of his quality
in the Campbelltown Handicap at Warwick
Farm on Saturday. He is a black stallion
of commanding appearance, being rather
like Pantheon, that other son of Tracery,
and is evidently as good as h e looks. Most
Sydney people thought Calmest would beat
him at the weights, the Newcastle mare
going out firm at 9 to 4, while Sol Green’s
horse receded from threes to 9 to 2—nothing
else was backed to any extent, although
there were 14 starter's —but, leaving the
barrier smartly and going easily behind
Calmest, King Val and Lile Queen as they
entered the straight, Gothic shot to the
front as soon as Ashley Reed moved on
him. Ivillarney (25 to 1) came home pretty
well, but w r as beaten easily by three parts
of a length; Calmest was another length
away; of the unplaced lot Bunkum and
Boaster did best. The watch showed lmin.
13sec. Favorite for the Epsom before the
race, the English horse was at a very short
price afterwards.
Amounis won the Ilobartville Stakes in
1925 and Rampion beat Limerick last year.
Merry Mint may not be in the Limerick or
Rampion class, but his performance on
Saturday may be regarded as a good A.J.C.
Derby trial in a below-average year. Backed
from tens (in places) to 9 to 2, he hopped
away smartly and was running second to
Greenline (7 to 2) at the home turn. As
soon as Bartle called on him he came right
away, winning by three lengths from Vaals’s
brother Sion (10 to 1), who vims a head in
front of Black Duchess (20 to 1), the time
being lmin. 27sec. Merry Mint improved
greatly on his exhibition at Roseliill on
August 20. Sion, who was badly placed
for five of the seven furlongs, finished pretty
well, but Greenline and his stable-companion
Chromium failed to stay, as also did Prime
Don.
The Warwick Stakes was remarkable for
the dismal failure of Valicare aud for
Limerick’s triumph over his Maoriland rela-
tive and rival Commendation. In spite of
the Valais mare’s numerous defeats, she
opened favorite at 9 to 4 and was 5 to 2 at
the close, the same as Limerick, for whom
there was substantial support at half a point
longer. Commendation was always at threes
and Amounis at fours, McShortodds being
determined that he would win whoever lost.
Valicare tried to steal the race, as she once
did at Windbag’s expense in the early part of
her career, but she had had enough at six fur-
longs. Commendation, who had done the
chasing, came into the straight slightly ahead
of Amounis, but was tackled and passed by
the Magpie horse, who was himself challenged
by Limerick. All three finished stoutly, and
heads only separated them. Had Toohey rid-
den Amounis as patiently as McCarten rode
Limerick first and second would probably
have changed places; but it was not Toohey’s
day out. Commendation justified his high
M.L. reputation, and his condition can be
improved. Valicare finished last, lengths
behind Coin Nut (a nice cut of a handicap
horse) and Valamita; the time equalled that
made by Windbag a year ago, lmin. 38sec.
The conditions of the Spring Handicap
did not admit of Valparaiso being penalised
for his recent successes, so with 6st. 91b. he
had a great pull in the weights and was a
3-to-l favorite always. Fuji San’s brother
ran a dashing race. Though restless at the
barrier, lie moved away well and was soon
in second place behind Drawbridge. That
much-travelled animal was permitted to make
the running for a mile or so; then Valpar-
aiso shot to the front, and for the rest of
the journey he had things all his own way.
though Murillo (7 to 1) momentarily looked
like catching him. Beedos (4 to 1) was
third, two lengths behind Eric Connolly’s
horse, who was three-quarters of a length
behind the winner. Valparaiso galloped the
14 furlongs in 2min. 17fsec., exceptionally
fast time for Warwick Farm (or any other
course, for that matter) ; and he is now well
fancied for the Metropolitan, in which he has
7st. Spectre (10 to 1) made it a profit-
able day for McShortodds by downing Bacagi
(6 to 1) and Bravado (3 to 1) in the Glen-
lee Handicap. Like Valparaiso, this grey
THE SERIOUS LIFE.
SHE: “You take betting very seriously, don’t you?”
HE: “I do, kid, I do! If I had a sense of humor I'd stop.”
Clirysolaus—Virtu gelding has now won
three races at Warwick Farm.

Limerick and Commendation will probably
meet again in the Chelmsford Stakes at
Randwick next Saturday. Amounis lias
also been nominated, but he is in another
race, as also is Fuji San. Biplane, Gloaming
and Heroic won the Chelmsford as tliree-
year-olds ; youngsters engaged on Saturday
include Merry Mint, Statesman, Glenariff
and Genuine, the last a gelded brother to
Lady Valais who is doing exceptionally good
work on the track, albeit he persistently
refuses to leave the barrier with the colors
up. The Tramway Handicap at this meet-
ing generally throws light on the Epsom.
Some tote possibilities :
Novice Handicap: Tangible, 1; Woolita,
2.
Tramway Handicap : Aorangi or Vaals, 1;
Boaster or Pigeon Pie, 2; Fuji San, 3.
Chelmsford Stakes: Amounis, 1; Limerick,
2 ; Commendation, 3.
Spring Handicap: Royal Sun, 1; Coin
Nut, 2 ; Bacchus, 3.
Welter: Aorangi or Triplex, 1; Lovebox or
Pigeon Pie, 2; Kalloni, 3.

Williamstown form was borne out at
Caulfield on Saturday, to the confusion of
most punters. They made Phonic favorite
again (at 5 to 2 this time) for the w.f.a.
race, although he had been well beaten by
Royal Charter in the Underwood Stakes and
was meeting him only 41b. better at a dis-
tance (nine furlongs) more suited to the
Comedy King horse, who went out at 7 to 2.
As at Williamstown, Byron was the pace-
maker, but he failed to come on, as also did
Phonic, who ran up to him at the home
turn ; Royal Charter, passing the beaten pair
in a few strides, came on to win by three-
quarters of a length from the fast-finishing
Pitoota (15 to 1), who was half a length
ahead of Sacedon. Veteran Bob Lewis rode
Royal Charter, whose trainer, Jack Holt,
would feel out of it if a horse of his didn’t
win the Memsie Stakes.
Raised 41b. (to 9st. 121 b.) for his Wil-
liamstown success, Translator was allowed
to drift to 14 to 1 for the Whittier Handi-
cap. The going was a hit dead, and the
theory was that it wouldn’t suit him ; more-
over, Foster had the mount instead of Cairns,
and it was a better field. As it happened,
the Svdney horse won more comfortably than
at Williamstown; Ninbela (20 to 1), another
of Ben Chaffey's tliree-year-olds, was second.
and The Wensum (11 to 2), runner-up at
WiliamStown, third. Affirm was also at a
longer price than at Williamstown—B to
1 for the Heatherlie Handicap as against
fives for the August Handicap. Ragazzo
(12 to 1), who must be puzzling Godby and
Falkiner, made all the running and contested
every yard of the finish, being beaten by
a “short” head; Homerus (15 to 1) was a
poor third. There was good money for
Finsbury (4 to 1) and Piastoon (8 to 1),
but neither was ever sighted on the journey,
The nine furlongs were covered in Imiu.
sr»sec —Isec. faster than Royal Charter's
time.
L. Iv. S. Mackinnon was pleased with the
runaway win of his colt Farrago (5 to 1),
who had Duncan’s services, in the Doona
Trial. Farrago has important engagements,
but liis breeding (he is by Absurd —Leta)
does not suggest his staying the Derby dis-
tance. Pitoota’s showing was encouraging,
but it has yet to be proved that his sire,
Rizzio, gets stayers; and Sacedon will be a
very exceptional Sarchedon if he can go a
mile and a half. There are some who think
The Wensum will prove the best of the Vic.
three-year-olds, now that Royal Feast is out
of it.
* * * H=
“Ike Mcßagg”: Someone played a foul
trick on a Leger bookmaker at Warwick
Farm. He presented a ticket for £B, which
is a lot of money in the Leger, and the
Tommy paid out unsuspectingly. But it was
a base fraud, and when the right ticket was
presented the unhappy layer had to fork out
again. Investigation showed that the origi-
nal printed number of the bogus brief had
been erased and the number corresponding to
the bet in the book substituted. It was
perfectly printed, and the only possible sur-
mise is that the ruffian had taken a portable
printing outfit to the course with him. It
seems a lot of trouble to go to for the sake
of eight quid, but no doubt the urge of
artistic accomplishment moved the ingenious
one, as well as his desire for the lucre.
* * * *
Royal Feast and Agrion, Maoriland’s Derby
hope, have failed to stand training and were
scratched last week for all their spring
engagements. Silvius was also withdrawn
from the Caulfield Cup, and Quan Tart from
the Epsom Handicap. The way of the ante-
post punter is sown with spring-guns.

“.Tinker’’: It is astounding how few
jockeys can use a whip these days. Many
boys never learn to draw it without lessen-
ing the strain on the reins. Bob Lewis is
probably our best craftsman with the
“mop.” Duncan is also good. But W. H.
McLaclilan was the greatest of them all.
A whip was worth a half-stone allowance
to McLaclilan when he was riding a shirker
over the last two hundred yards.
* * * *
“The Rumpus’’: N. Grant, owner of Loeli-
ite, a Westralian hurdler, rides the animal
in races over the sticks. Thrice in his last
four starts the noble steed has blundered,
and on each occasion the rider has had his
collar-bone broken. The nearer the bone,
they say, the sweeter the meat, but one’s
neck is not far from the collar-bone.
* * * *
“Thormanby”: Maoriland figures for the
racing year 1926-27 show Absurd at the head
of the list of winning sires, with £23,309;
Solferino was second, with £23,125. Com-
mendation, now in Sydney, was a long way
ahead of his rivals as a stake-collector, with
£6187, the fruits of eight wins, a dead-heat
for first and a second. By comparison Ram-
pion earned £6545 for his owners (and an
extra £4OO for them as breeders) by win-
ning one race—the A.J.C. Derby.

Melbourne’s football provided thrills on
Saturday, a howling gale notwithstanding.
At the beginning, Collingwood, Geelong and
Richmond were level for first place. When
darkness descended, ’Wood had got home,
from ’Don, by one point; Geelong had crashed
before St. fcilda by tw 7 o points, and the
Tigers had been routed by Carlton by seven
points, the latter team thus stepping into
fourth place, with every prospect of staying
there. The Richmond-Carlton go was very
willing. At one stage four players were
fighting, and the luckless umpire stopped
one himself while rebuking them; later, two
more got into holts, while clenched fists
could be seen flying in the scrambling rucks.
It was a great game entirely; and the Blue
barraekers were so overjoyed that, after a
fierce brawl towards the close, a mob of
them chased a Richmond party out of the
ground and half way home. Carlton, 30
points; Richmond, 23, was the tally. The
Geelong-St. Ivilda scuffle was more orderly,
the seasiders’ defeat being chiefly due to
vile kicking—B goals 22 behinds to Saints’
9 goals 18 behinds. ’Wood’s play was noth-
ing to brag about, the ’Dons leading through-
out ; only a strenuous last quarter and a
lucky kick off the ground even as the bell
rang, gave ’Wood the needful point—3l to
‘Don’s 30. Footscray flabbergasted Fitzroy
by piling up 101 points to 72; South Mel-
bourne smashed North, 78 to 60; and Melb.
pulverised Hawthorn. 73 to 33 —a choice
example of wasted endeavor.
(Continued on Page 41.)
Major Goodsell, world’s champion scufler,
had no trouble in beating the English chal-
lenger, Bert Barry, in their match on Burrard
Inlet. Vancouver. The Australian won by 10
lengths ; the time for the race, “about” four
miles, Was 24min. 16sec.
THE OLD HORSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“it is on record in the office of the W.A. Turf
Club that three old racehorses have died of starvation
in paddocks after their days of usefulness have been
outlived.’’- —Perth Call.
To this we coine at the end, who have run
our final courses ;
Slaves whom man has worked to the sum of
our full resources,
Forgotten and thrown aside—the pitiful Old
Horses.
Once they took pride to themselves in our
beauty and our paces.
We were the gods adored by ten thousand
eager faces,
Who now are meat for the waiting crows,
in the lonely places.
Then, they were hotly quick to glorify and
applaud us,
Trampling hard on each other’s heels to
beslobber and laud us ;
Now, of a guerdon gallantly earned they,
callous, defraud us.
Yet we brought them the greasy gold that
they ever ask for;
The filthy lucre they set us so many a hate-
ful task for;
The gain of rogues whom our worth was
ever a seemly mask for.
But it may be that the Fate that guards
the sparrow in his falling
Will hear, in appointed time, the agony of
our
And make some shift to ease for us the
burden and the galling;
Will find for us a pasture, with musical
waters flowing
Through a land of warm, sweet winds in the
lush, green grasses blowing.
And leave us alone, at last, in a peace beyond
all knowing.

Mechanical Coursing
Owing to intricacies in the satisfactory operation of mechanical coursing
tracks we have not granted any sub-licenses for patents controlled by us in
Australia. In association with Hinks Bros.’ Construction Company, Limited, who
are the designers and contractors for the coursing track of the Queensland Electric
Coursing Association, Limited, we have already prepared plans and specifications
for the Newcastle Coursing and Sporting Club, Limited, and the Australasian
Coursing Club, Limited, Sydney.
Even though the plant is widely adaptable and can be used either underground
or on the surface, it is essential that any ground be first inspected by a technical
expert before it can be selected as being suitable.

“Windsor”: The Anglo-Saxon hasn’t
things all liis own way in Melbourne foot-
ball. Playing with Melbourne senior teams
this season are (or were) a brace of Morellis,
a Gomez, a Garcia, a Titus, a Helwig, a Bols,
a Beretta, a Karthaus, a Marchesi, a Bazin,
a Pettiona, a Vosti, a Weidner and a de
Aranga. Of the dinkum British families,
the Johnsons, with seven representatives,
are the most numerous. There are five Har-
rises ; a quartet of Taylors, Walshes and
'' hites ; three each of the Clarke, Williams,
Martin and Thomas clans; a couple of
Smiths and Browns, and one solitary Jones.
. “Coot” : Nortlicote, one of Victoria’s Asso-
ciation clubs, won’t forget its trip to Geelong
to meet the local Association team. Mel-
bourne and Geelong League clubs were play-
ing there the same day. They drew £450;
the receipts at the other match were a whole
£2. And Geelong Association had to pay
the umpires £7 10s.

The second semi-final in Sydney’s Austra- i
lian-rules competition saw Eastern Suburbs \
extended by South Sydney. Indeed, South
was leading by 11 points at the beginning of <
the final quarter. But the Easterners came \
with a paralysing sequence of six goals, and
won by 79 (11-13) to 59 (8-11). ;
❖ * * *
The N.S.W. Rugby League’s minor pre-
miership remained in South Sydney’s keep- i
ing after Saturday’s match on the Cricket
Ground; South defeated St. George by 22 ;
to 9. The previous meeting of the clubs
had been tempestuous, and it was with (
pleasurable anticipation of a stoushful after- ;
noon that 27,000 people pushed through the
gates, only to be disappointed as far as blood- l
shed was concerned. The game was fast and
hard, though marred by the persistent offside
play of the St. George forwards and backs.
The idea was to crowd the opposition, but
they lost far more advantage than they
gained. St. George, with the wind in its
favor, opened the scoring with a penalty
goal, and a good piece of opportunism by
full-back Meighan brought a try; the Illa-
warra men were two points ahead —9-7 —at
half-time. But with the breeze behind them
the fast and clever South backs gradually
took charge of the game. Finch, running
with great determination, scored three good
tries, and gave his best exhibition this
season. Kadwell again did well at full-
back, while the veteran Blair was as elusive
as ever at five-eighth, and Carr and Tre-
weeke held their own with the big Illawarra
forwards. Western and Eastern Suburbs
fought an unamiable battle, in the course
of w r hich a Westerner had to retire for
repairs. East was leading, 6 to 5, just on
time; then a lucky try by Redmond gave his
side the lead and the match. East’s score
consisted of three goals by Oxford, who
kicked his 41st for the season. Newtown
and University played an uninteresting go-
as-you-please, Newtown emerging with 19 vo
17. It has reason to be grateful to T.
Ellis, who landed six goals in seven attempts.
The curtain went down for the season on
Glebe and North Sydney. North scraped
home by 19 to 18.
The last phase of the Sydney League
season begins next Saturday with South
Sydney, St. George, Eastern and. Western
Suburbs figuring in the play-off matches. On
form there is only one in it, though St.
George still has hopes.
* * * *
“Gate” : Agents for English League teams
are still snapping up pros, in Australia. Last
week two of South Sydney’s best men in
Harris, the inter-State three-quarter, and
Carr, who can play anywhere, were pur-
chased, and others are considering offers.
Each man receives a £600 bonus, £6 a week
and £6 a match. It seems almost too good
to be true.
The end of the Rugby Union season came
with the knock-out. final between Manly and
Rahdwfick at University Oval. Randwick
won on the post, after Manly had led, 12-6,
the first half; final scores were 15 to 12. A
preliminary game between teams of referees
and ex-representative players produced un-
expectedly good football, though the referees
were frequently at sea with the rules and
were too free with backchat.

N.S.W. Soccer players were mostly inter-
ested in a Newcastle match for the Gardiner
Cup; West Wallsend, which has held the
trophy many times, was knocked out by
Cessnoek, 3' goals to nil. With .Cessnock
in the semi-finals are Gladesville-Ryde,
Granville and St. George.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
“Tiger” Cline sealed 12st. when he met
Johnnie Squires at the Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night; the Boer went 12st. 711b.
There was trouble over the Yank’s gloves
before they clashed, there being so much
adhesive tape around his knuckles that he
couldn’t get the things on. Another pair from
a set showing signs of much previous use was
brought, but, as in the Payne affair, the big
S’African was kept waiting in his chair for
fully ,10 minutes. New manager Grifhtn,
who took over on September 1, will have to
attend to these little Yankee tricks. Squires
avenged himself by administering heavy
punishment, particularly with jabs to the face.
For most of every round Cline either backed
away, taking stiff punches, or rushed in and
walloped madly at the arms or protecting
gloves. In the eleventh a hook to the
temple, followed by a right to the jaw, sent
Cline well on the way to dreamland; but
Squires, though cool in emergencies, is a
slow thinker, and he missed a very promis-
ing chance of a knock-out. Neither man
was in proper fighting form, and the affair
became almost farcical towards the end,
when the hitherto dangerous and aggressive
Squires became too tired to hit a groggy
and gory target whose legs would hardly
support him. Squires on points.
“ILK.”: Probably the most versatile
stoush promoter Australia has known is
Westralian Charlie Lucas, who steered Digger
Evans along the thorny path of fistiana.
Once in Adelaide, Charlie arranged a fight
between one Bungardy and “Snowy” Steele.
He trained both pugs, sold the tickets at the
window, and then refereed the bout.

Those well-known knockabout comedians
Canadian Bill Edwards (12st. 41b.) and
Mike Yokel (12st. 101 b.), of Wyoming, re-
appeared at Melbourne Stadium on Satur-
day night. Familiar as their act is, they
drew an immense crowd at very high prices
for vaudeville. After a spectacular first
round, William brought Mike (and the
house) down in the second with an arm-bar
and body-scissors. Then he so far forgot
HIS PREFERENCE.
DAD ( thickly ): “Take the kids t’ see the giraffe, Gladysh — I’m gonner (hic) watch
thish football match.”
himself as to strike Wyoming—not heavily
—on the face. Mike good-naturedly retali-
ated, and the crowd was thrilled. In the
fourth round Mike got even with a step-
over toe-hold. In the sixth the Canadian
went in for rabbit punches varied with a
blow under the chin. Emboldened by his
success and the horrified approval of the
crowd, lie jolted Mike’s stummick with a
knee, whereat Bridges stepped in and said
the owner of the knee was disqualified. Bill
objected, and attempted to address the
crowd from the ring. By lowering the lights
the management cut short the harangue,
and the thick-eared orator had to find his
way out in the dark.
Racquet and Bawl
“Let”: Tilden’s failure at Wimbledon gave
the American lawn-tennis world a scare, but
recent cables indicate that Uncle Sam is
getting his tail up again. He has decided
that Brugnon, Lacoste and co. played like
very tired men against the Japanese, and
their form in subsequent matches has con-
vinced him that “the French threat has
passed the peak.” That the Gauls are taking
a spell in view of the struggle to come does
not seem to have occurred to our relative
beyond the Pacific. That aspect may be
brought home to him later. With Tilden at
liis best the Americans will, of course, take
a power of beating, but the Frenchmen have
youth on their side. And youth tells in
lawn-tennis as in other games.
H? ❖❖ *
“Baseline” : Spurred to emulation by South
Africa’s example, the Australian lawn-tennis
authorities nearly took a chance last week —
they almost made up their minds to invite
Cochet, Brugnon and Lacoste, now in
America, to visit Australia on their way to
Africa. The Frenchmen are not due in the
Union for some months, and a visit to this
country after they have settled accounts with
the Americans would fill in the time nicely.
However, the tennis heads in Melbourne
were still pondering on their next move, at
last advices. They are a cautious lot.
* ** *
“Cut Shot”: Helen Wills, supreme at
Wimbledon, retained her U.S. title last week.
Her opponent in the final was the English
girl, Betty Nutliall; Helen beat the pertinaci-
ous 16-year-old 6-1, 6-4, after Betty had
made the pick of the other Americans look
cheap. An exhibition game between Helen
and Suzanne would be an intriguing meeting
if it could only be arranged, and under the
rules as interpreted in Australia it could be
staged here. The lovers of a lively scrap
from Cape York to the Leeuwin would
travel —on foot, if need be —just to see it,
and the “gate” would have the tin-hare people
throwing fits.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Scruff” : The Australian open champion-
ship, the blue ribbon of golf this side of the
Equator, went to a professional this year •
Rufus Stewart, the big South Australian,
triumphed at Sandringham (Vic.) with a
total of 297—74, 75, 73, 75. Stewart was
runner-up last year, when amateur Ivo
Wliitton (Victoria) pipped him, making,
curiously enough, the same figures as this
year's winner. Stewart is a very long driver,
though his game is sound enough in other
particulars, and his success goes to emphasise
the fact already clinched by the triumphs of
Bobby Jones —-that victory on modern golf-
courses is prone to smile on the man who can
get long and consistent distance from the
tee. H. R. Sinclair, N.S.W. and Australian
amateur champion of 1925, now playing as a
professional, was only two strokes behind
Stewart, while Frank Eyre, also of N.S.W.,
finished in third place with a score of 800.
Ivo Whitton was fifth on the list with 803,
but was easily in the lead of the amateur
division.
* * *
“Fore”: The maddening tangle of contra-
dictions called the rules of golf got another
advertisement at Sandringham during the
progress of the Australian amateur four-
somes. Alex Russell and F. E. Headlam
were leading from Ivo Whitton and Legh
Winser when their ball w T as stolen. Such
a contingency ought to be covered by a
commonsense rule that anew ball may be
dropped without penalty. But the rules of
golf aren’t like that, so the unfortunate
players were penalised two strokes because
some thieving urchin did some quick think-
ing. And instead of winning outright they
had to be content with a tie.
“Ploughman” : Further evidence that golf
is becoming a game for the young has been
furnished by the victory of 19-year-old
Phyllis Jones in the N.S.W. women s cham-
pionship singles at Kensington, Sydney.
Phyllis's play on the greens was an object-
lesson to a lot of would-be champions
among the gents. On only one green did she
have to take three putts; on five she sank
the pill in one. Accuracy in her long game
was also remarkable. The young player
should rank high in Australian golf tor
years to come.
* * * *
“Baffy”: Last week-end saw almost the
entire Australian continent in the throes of
championship golf. While the N.S.W. women
were struggling for supremacy in Sydney,
and the Australian titles were being fought
for in Victoria, T. Cassidy won the Wes-
tralian amateur honors from Leo Smith by
7 up and 6 to play, and Rupert Patou
became champion of Southern Tasmania.
And across the Tasman E. .T. Moss, the Auck-
land club's professional, collected the
Maoriland open with a score of 300.
“Crowball”: The old Queensland spirit
of separation is creeping into golf. The
Townsville and Longreach players have
signified their intention of setting up shows
of their own, the N.Q. and C.Q. Associations
respectively, and the State body has con-
sented. It was stated at the meeting that
the Charters Towers club was the oldest
in Queensland, but this has always been
disputed by Townsvilleans. There was a
golf club in Townsville in 1892. The Towers
club was formed slightly later. It expired,
but was re-formed about 1910.
>]: * * *
“Cleek”: The reason why professional
golfers leave home may be discovered in some
recent news from America about Joe Kirk-
wood, the former Manly caddie. According
to this, Joseph is now sitting behind
£100,000, acquired entirely from golf. In
addition to a retaining-fee of some thousands
annually from the Radium Springs chib,
Joseph receives heavy fees from clubmakels
for the use of his name, still heavier fees
for the few lessons he can spare time to
give, and a standing payment of 500 dahlers
for an hour’s exhibition of those trick shots
at the performance of which he is in a class
by himself.

“Scruff”: The Irish open golf champion-
ship, which dates back to 1892, has been
won this year by George Duncan, winner of
the British open in 1920. Duncan’s figures
were 318 for 72 holes, but as the game was
played in a howling gale, with bursts of
heavy rain, the performance was full of
merit.
Car and Cycle
“Felix”: Harris Horder (B. l/9/’27) is
a son of George Horder, himself a great
cyclist, as also is Horace, another son. The
father, although past 50, occasionally shows
a glimpse of his old form —only last season
he won a race with a sprint that left bike-
pusliers half his age panting in the rear. The
conditions of the American sprint champion-
ship make it exceptionally hard to win. Jacky
Clarke had a shot at it several times, but
always found Kramer in the way. Cecil
Walker, of Marrickville, went very close two
years ago—in fact, his victory was prema-
turely announced. But he was disqualified
on some minor point.
* * * *
“Hugo”: Joseph Harris (B. 25/8/’27)
was undoubtedly the inventor of the “bone-
shaker.” The wheeled contraption of Regency
days was known as the “dandy-horse”; it
had spasmodic vogues right up to ’67, when.
Harris’s invention was put on the road.
There were no patents, and village wheel-
wrights and blacksmiths made boneshakers
by the score. The wheels, as a rule, were
of equal sizes, the leader taking the drive
and the hind wheel the weight of the rider.
The material was wood, and the wheels were
shod with iron. The high machine followed,
its offspring being a geared contrivance
known as the “Kangaroo.” Then came the
“safeties,” in the first of which the wheels
were connected, not by means of a diamond
frame, but by a single piece of iron tubing,
which sooner or later gave way at one of the
joints, The diamond frame was of Ilarris-
ian design ; it was dropped during the inter-
regnum of the high wheel.
* * * *
“Rolls Liz”: People who don’t care for
the now popular type of enclosed car and
dislike the trouble of handling a hood, with
its manipulation of straps and buttons, will
welcome a new device described in motor-
trade journals. It is an adaptation of the
old rolltop-desk idea. When up, the gadget
gives all the comfort and seclusion of an
enclosed car; when not wanted, the thing is
simply rolled back out of sight by touching
a spring and giving it a slight push, the
whole contraption disappearing into a special
receptacle at the rear which is not visible
and does not interfere with the appearance
of the ’bus. It can be put up again as
quickly and as easily.

“Gearbox”: The Vie. Light-ear Club’s
24-hour reliability and petrol-consumption
test over a 504-miles run ended in a victory
for British-built*cars. The run was over
a carefully-selected route comprising some
of the worst road stretches in the State, and
the cars had to keep to a time-schedule
which did not admit of loafing over the bad
parts. They were weighted on a basis of
llcwt. for each lOOc.c. of engine capacity,
and the quantity of petrol issued to each
was governed by the size of the engine. The
nine British cars which took part in the
test, though driven by private owners, most
of whom had never figured in a reliability
run before, returned a record of 100 per
cent, efficiency.

“Geebung”: Driving a Chrysler Six at
Lake Perkolilli, two Westralian motorists
completed 1000 miles in 14 hours 35 min-
utes. Thereby they knocked 38 minutes off
the Australian record established at
Maroubra (N.S.W.). For the greater part
of their journey, Attwood and Colliver
did over 70 m.p.h.; they stopped for fuel
replenishments and change of drivers every
three hours. Lake Perkolilli was mentioned
in a recent Bulletin par. Twenty-six miles
from Kalgoorlie, it has a surveyed circuit
of two miles on a perfect surface of sun-
baked clay.

“Adam II.”: The female of the species is
swarming into the motor-cycling game. In a
reliability trial held in one of the London
suburbs the darlings had it all to themselves,
and cut out some good times. The big event,
the Inauguration Cup, was won by a Miss
Debenham on a B.S.A. Time was when the
question “What did you do when you were
a girl, Grandma?” led to the production of
some marvellous samples of fine sewing. In
the years to come the reply promises to be
the production of a photograph of grandma,
in the position ascribed by Kipling to “His
Majesty’s Sappers,” winning the Tin Tlat
(or something like that) on her 2.49-h.p.
Mugwump.
Miscellaneous
“Machete”: Queensland sporting scribes
are leaving the Bruce Lowe book and tne
Turf Register to grow dusty on the shelves
while they wrestle with the pedigrees of
racing goats. One enthusiast has been spread-
ing himself on the subject of Ivoongai, who
may be said to have fairly Windbagged
everything else in his class. This super-
goat was bred at Rockhampton, but, sad
to say, his sire and dam were “unknown.”
Because of that he w r as sold for 2s. 6d.,
presumably at the local kid sales. Since then
he has won over £200 in stakes, and his
owner-trainer refused £50 for him at Bris-
bane Show.
* $ *
“C.Q.”: Where a fortnight ago dozens
yawned, it is now hard to find a vacant
shop in the chief suburban shopping centres
round Melbourne. The cause of the trade-
boom is a High Court judgment that
“Diggers’ bagatelle” is legal. Philanthropi-
cally-inclined citizens anxious to fill a great
public need moved in with their tables on
the spot, and their reward' has exceeded
expectations. Crowds, largely of women
and factory girls, pack the more or less
gilded haunts till midnight and later, and
complaints of lack of ventilation and fire
exits are already being heard. The three
balls and the nine holes and the threepenny
pool, with a prize ahead of 2s. 6d., provide
an unlaborious way of losing one’s wages.
The profit to the house, it is pointed out, is
only sixpence a game, but a game lasts a
mere 45 seconds, and there is never much
delay. So the bagatelle nobility should soon
be rivalling the pony aristocracy and the
tin-hare peerage.
* # * *
“A Berlin” : The first visit by an English
athletic team to Germany since the war
resulted in a victory for the invaders, all
members of the Achilles Club. They com-
peted in a match against the Deutsche and
the Berliner clubs and finished with 70
points, as against 02 for the Deutscliers and
00 for the Berliners. Lowe and Stallard.
both Olympic representatives, won the 400
metres and the 800 metres respectively.
"Heel and Toe!/: G. Smith, of Botany
(N.S.W.) Harriers, put up a good perform-
ance when he won the 50-miles walking
championship of N.S.W. in 9 hours 17min.
32 2-5sec., knocking 2min. 51 3-5sec. off J.
Lewis’s figures of last year. Little less
creditable was the achievement of the Queens-
land representative, H. P. McMurdo, who
followed up his victory in the Sydney mara-
thon race the previous Saturday by taking
second place in the road walk; his time was
9 hours 34min. 9scc. A Scotsman by birth,
McMurdo represented his native country
against England before be came to Australia.
Though not exactly a Kolehmaincn as a
marathon runner, or a Frigerio as a walker,
lie is tough and versatile.
* * >. * *
“Koolanga”: In view of the success of
Yankee crews using swivel rowlocks on their
eights (P,. IS/8/’27), Vic. oarsmen are
interestedly watching an experiment of the
Banks club. A crack maiden eight has been
selected for the Henley-on-Y arra regatta,
and the boat equipped with the, swivels
used by the Vic. crew of 1910 —they were
the only rowlocks of the type to be found
in the State. For my part, I am not enthusi-
astic. Swivels may mean greater length before
and behind the rigger, but it is doubtful if that
advantage overcomes the trouble entailed in
getting the hands away and the blade out
cleanly.
“Splash”: The proposal of the Vic. Swim-
ming Association that German swimmers
Rademacher and F'rolich should be invited to
Australia for the coming season is being put
to a vote of all the States. It is unlikely
that the necessary two-thirds majority will
be obtained. Rademacher claims to hold
every world’s record for breaststroke swim-
ming. His mate is a backstroke artist, pure
and simple. No worthy opponent could be
found here for either man, and there would
be small prospect of big offertories if one
were discovered.
* * *
“Glen A.”: Billiards, is probably Aus-
tralia’s oldest pastime. Iran 1801 return
of occupations there is mention of a billiard-
marker at Sydney, which suggests that the
game must have been played in an organised
way within a few years of the arrival of the
First Fleet. But the first billiard-saloon on
modern lines was Opened in 1847 by a
Sydney publican, Thomas Spencer, whose
Shakspeare hotel was on the Pitt-street. site
now occupied by the Australian Bank of
Commerce. Spencer also constructed the
first billiard-table made in Australia. The
bed comprised pieces of wood about a foot
long instead of slate, aud for the rubber
cushions he bought out a stationer's entire
stock of pencil-erasers.
“Shrewsbury”: Lancashire is again the
champion cricket county; an innings defeat
in the last match by Glamorgan, whose only
win it was for the season, cost Notts the
honors. Yorkshire was third and Kent
fourth; Surrey, in spite of Hobbs, Sandham
and co., was only sixth. As in 1926, McDon-
ald proved himself a tower of strength to
the county of the red rose. He cared no-
thing for averages if he could get good men
early, and that he very often managed to do.
❖ ❖ :J:
“Aigburth”: It may be that Notts (B.
l/9/’27) is handicapped as a cricketing
county by comparison with its more thickly-
populated rivals, Lancashire and Yorkshire,
but that may fairly be balanced by the well-
known fact that its chief industry is the
manufacture and export of professional
cricketers. In my cricketing days, when a
school or a club wanted a professional coach
FRANK MAHER, captain of Essendon,
who played his hundredth consecutive
Vic. League game when his team de-
feated St. Kilda.
u just wrote to Shaw and Shrewsbury.
Next day a nice new pro., batsman or
“bowler” or both, as required, would be
delivered, carriage paid, with the morning
mail. In the winter time the inhabitants
of Notts played Soccer football, as the
triumphs of Notts County and Notts Forest
in. “T’ Coop” will testify. I low the dickens
they ever found time to make lace curtains
and the like has always mystified me.
* * * *
“Hotliam”: The annual meeting c. the
Vic. Cricket Association disclosed a very
satisfactory financial position. The over-
draft lias been reduced to £3914, while
£32,494 has been paid off the building
account, leaving a balance of £5975 still
owing—a big all-round reduction in liabili-
ties. There were seven candidates for the
six places on the executive committee —Dr.
Allen Robertson, one of the University dele-
gates, stood down. E. C. Yeomans and Mat
Ellis tied for tin* last place, and there was
an. affecting “After-yon- dear-Alphonse” in-
terlude ; then chairman Donald Mackinnon
put his hoof down and fastened the job on
Ellis. Billy Woodfull withdrew from the
selection committee, which will be composed
this year of Vernon Hansford, Peter McAlis-
ter and Carl Willis.

“Tenth Slip”: The N.S.W. cricket
authorities have very properly decided to
carry on with the Country Week, so suc-
cessful last; season. The association has

Queensland recently.
hoggins o’ brass, as they say in Lancashire,
and the affair may bring to light a new
bowler or two. Sydney is tragically
deficient in bowlers; there does not seem
to be a really good one in any class,
slow, medium, fast, or just “knock-’em-
out.” Now that beauty competitions
have taken the knoex, one or more of our
esteemed daily journals might do worse
than offer a prize for another Turner or even
another McKibbin. A free trip to Can-
berra could be added as an additional attrac-
tion, and no doubt the tailoring, haber-
dashery, cricket-goods and motor-car firms
would spar up, as usual.
“Lansdowne”: A shilling subscription has
been launched in England to reward the
“hundred hundreds” of Philip Mead, the
Hampshire professional. One . reason ad-
vanced why it should be well supported is
that Mead, who was born in ’B7, attained the
coveted distinction at an earlier age than
either “W.G.,” Hayward or Hobbs; another
is that he is the first left-hand batsman
to complete the Great Achievement, though
it is hard to see precisely what this
has to do with it. Philip is Surrey-born, and
might still be playing for Surrey, but, though
lie was regarded as a highly promising youth,
they didn’t give him enough chances at the
Oval. So he turned his eyes elsewhere, and,
according tp H. S. Altham, author of the
most readable book on cricket ever written,
he was so hard up at the time that he had
to walk to his new job. F'ortunately for him
Surrey and Hants are neighboring counties.
“Der Jong” : It is always pleasant to hear
of an increase in the export trade, and the
decision of “Judge” Swindell, who established
the tin-hare industry in Australia, to take
200 greyhounds from this country. to South
Africa will be received with general approval.
The jurist in question has made a great
success of his enterprise in this country and
desires to extend his triumphs. But the
only S’Africau locality that looks likely to
take the game on is Jo’burg, where they
are always ready to try anything once. It
is, too, the only city in Afrikanderland that
supports in any quantity the type of person
likely to become a tin-hare addict. Nearly
everywhere else the promoter of professional
sport soon outlives his welcome, as a gentle-
man now on the fringe of the tin-hare busi-
ness in Sydney had unpleasantly impressed
on him. Coursing proper is unknown in
the Union. There used to be a little whippet-
racing on the Rand, but that soon committed
suicide in the usual manner. The S’African
politician, too, is apt to be lacking in
broadmindedness, as compared with his
N.S.W. brother, and the betting laws are
enforced over there in a manner to which
we are strangers here. Still, one wishes
the new enterprise well. Anything that will
rid this country of 200 beasts as useless as
the greyhound has i.fs good points.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Sucre”: A Western Queensland dingo
dealer palmed off calves’ ears as dingo scalps
on a newchum inspector and got his 10s. a
scalp. He clipped the ears from young cattle
which had gone down in the drought.
*
“Bill R.”: An outsize in stones was
recently heaved from Dorman Long’s quarry
at Moruya (N.S.W.). The gibber, of solid
uncracked granite, measured 52ft. long, 27ft.
wide and 20ft. deep, and weighed 2000 tons
or thereabouts.
:ls * * *
“Sucre” : Australia uses millions of nibs,
holders and fountain-pens annually. And all
are manufactured overseas. Much more
intricate work is done in Australian factories,
yet we still are dependent on other countries
for this essential article. Probably another
case of inadequate-Protection.
* * =5 *
“Simon” : For specially heavy mallets the
foreman in the engineering shop near me
insisted on hickory handles. The warehouse
ran out of the line and substituted local
gum at a little more than half the price.
Protesting, the foreman had the handles
fitted. He found that they stood up to the
work better than the imported timber, and
without the preliminary oiling said to be
necessary to get the best result from hickory.
* * *■ *
“H.C.L.”: In one day I noted the carts
of 10 milk-vendors, eight greengrocers, seven
bakers, seven butchers and five laundries
in our small street; nor is the census com-
plete. The waste of time, tyres, horses’
feet and roads, not to mention human, energy,
is tremendous. Why not stop the silliness,
and place the various suburbs on the block
system, as is done in the case of newspapers?
* «
“G.C.W.”: One feature of the Mount
Morgan winding-up deserves to be broadcast
to the credit of the board. In 1921, when
the future looked black, some members of
the staff accepted a 20 p.c. reduction in their
salaries. The directors, at the same time,
cut their own fees in halves. Notv they are
applying £5OOO to be shared by those staff
men, some of whom have seen over 30 years’
service.
* =l= * #
“Wilo”: The ’bus-tram war in Christ-
church (M.L.) has got to the stage where
wild things are being done. Not only is
the municipal tramway concern running
'buses to beat the other ’buses, but
it has introduced the one-man tram,
with a label up: “Pay as you enter,
with correct change, please.” The tram-
mies’ union would like to protest, but as
it’s been talking for years about the hor-
rible risks run by conductors in collecting
fares, it doesn’t know exactly how to phrase
its roar.
“Squid” : A report of the British Economic
Committee emphasises the fact that Aus-
tralia, though its seas teem with an unex-
celled food-fisli supply, imports fish from
Britain, Canada, South Africa, Maorilaud
and foreign countries —the value exceeded
£1,500,000 in 1925-26. It suggests that our
unexploited fishing grounds—the best are in
North Australia between Port Hedland and
Cape York—might be brought, into service
by sending factory-ships with the fishing
fleets. Not a bad idea either.
* * *
“Bicarb” : The huge profit in prescriptions
which consist of low-priced drugs and plain
water isn’t a regular thing in the chemist
business. The big universal provideries,
cash-and-carry stores and “chain” shops have
cut away the most lucrative part of many
a drug business and narrowed the margin
of profit on what remains. It is possible
at times for a chemist with small require-
ments to buy his “sundries” —soaps,
scents, etc. —as cheaply retail from some of
the sources mentioned as from the whole-
saler.
* :|: * *
“Nor” : The lay-by has more to commend
it than time-payment or cash orders; at
least the improvident and extravagant cannot
indulge. their tastes until they have paid for
the article. But the seller has the best of
the business. lie gets the use of the money
over an extended term free and the risks
aim taken by the buyer. Moths may eat the
article; and the seller may go bung. That
happened in a Sydney case recently dealt
with by the Registrar in Bankruptcy, who
found that a lay-by trader had taken “for his
own purposes” £2OOO, contributed by 1500
confiding customers.
❖ :J? *
“Avon”: Maorilaud has developed minds
that would put that of Ike Newton to shame.
In Wellington the other day three clerks
were haled before the cadi and charged
with inventing and publishing a cross-word
puzzle to which there were 64 possible solu-
tions. . They put up £25 of prize-money, and
paid it out honestly enough, but the police
reckoned it was a gamble. Solicitor for the
defence said that cross-word puzzles were
educational. The beak, after trying to do
the puzzle, decided that it was a gamble.

The Artists’ Ball wilts year by year. Mon-
day night’s racket was as respectable as a
babe’s rattle. Not even the presence of an
aeroplane built joyously of beer-bottles could,
top the brew of art students —roysterers
chiefly in costumes from the Hook and Eye—
with a froth of devil-may-care. The most
jocund part of the proceedings were the
decorations, and the only abandoned females
were those disporting on posters by the sad
sea waves. The lights wore golden shades,
and the Town Hall dome was a forest of
blue streamers. Art students rather than
artists possessed the land, and their raiment
was marked by an almost unanimous lack of
originality. A golden Bacchante dressed in
a grape-skin or two had a momentary
triumph, and Mary Edwards was colorful and
unusual as the Spectrum. Etcher Henry
Fullwood looked as though he’d taken the
train through from Boheme, and architect
George Taylor was an efficient chef who wore
a nose that flashed into an electric sign of
welcome when he met an old friend. Jose-
phine Marks led the pageant as the Duchess
of Devonshire, and Mrs. J. A. Wilson was a
complete reproduction of a page from the
Australia. Actresses Eva Novak and Zoe
Wencke added good looks to the heroically
dancing hundreds, and Charlie Westinacott
and E. J. Tait gave an unrehearsed present-
ment of the Babes in the Wood. Thea Proc-
tor and Roy de Mestre trod a measure.
There were Cossacks, Apaches, Dolly Var-
dens, Bedouins, Dutch Girls and Pierrettes,
and girls in fluffs of tulle the size of a pow-
der-puff. Everywhere there were legs, knees
dimpled and nobbly, and the sort of calves
that explain the persistent absence of the
prodigal son. The Viking and his lady, with
their son and his little dauglier, were not
only in the company but of it, Lady de Chair,
in rust-red draperies, and Elaine, in green,
pushing their way around with a gay deter-
mination.
Joseph Hislop, the tenor with the banks
and braes o’ Bonnie Doon in his voice,
was lunched by the Musical Association at
Farmer's last week. Joseph, in a coat woven
of one color and that brown (this Letter
couldn’t see for the table whether it finished
off in kilt or breeks), sat between Frank
Hutchens, president of the association, and
Arundel Orchard, the chief pippin of the
Conservatorium. Higher up sat accompanist
Sciarretti and Claude Kingston, while lower
down Charlie Westinacott and Laurence
Godfrey Smith hobnobbed over plain wine
and spoke of vintages of other lands. Frank
told Joseph how glad Sydney was to have
him with us; Joseph said how glad he was
to be with us. Arundel Orchard told Joseph
to sing songs by Brahms and Schubert, an 1
only to sing (enough ballads to keep the box
office tiger from eating him alive. - Joseph
feaid he’d remember that.
It was left to Sciarretti to tell the story
of the day. An Italian artist just arrived
in New York drifted into the dining-room
of his hotel for dinner. Near him sat two
who were finishing tlieir meal. “If I listen
hard,” he thought, “I can repeat what my
neighbors order, and so the waiter will noi
discover I don’t know the language.” Tin
waiter approached them. “Coffee and ice."
said one of the men. “Coffee and ice-
coffee and ice,” repeated the artist over and
over to himself. The waiter bent over him.
“Coffee and ice.” he said, and was aghast
when the repast was placed before him.
The next night, being late again, the only
words he still could catch were “Coffee and
ice.” On the third day. however, he picked
up “bacon and eggs.” That night lie went
into the dining-room a man desperate with
starvation. The waiter approached. “Bacon-
aneggs,” he ordered quickly. “What!” ex-
claimed a startled waiter. “Baconaneggs,”
responded the hungry one. “ What!" shouted
the waiter. Then the Italian knew he must
be terribly wrong, and rushed for safety.
“Coffee and ice,” lie whispered.
Mrs. Ilislop. who is one of Sweden's
daughters, won't be seeing much of her tenor
this trip if the barriers aren't put up. for
Joseph has agreed to listen to budding
Carusos and Melbas. The J.C.W. firm has
promised to give a chance in grand opera to
any young /■singer in Australia whom Mr.
Hislop decides is capable of doing the work.
Well. what about Gladys Verona. Vera
Bedford and Rene Maxwell, for a start?
And, if we're looking on the other side.
Walter Kirby? Not as young as he was,
perhaps; but that he should have been over-
looked long is no reason why he should be
overlooked longer.
It wasn’t one of Sydney's most swaggah
audiences that listened to tenor Joseph
Hislop on Saturday night. There was a
guid Scots flavor about the house and in
the long queue waiting to buy the five-
shilling tickets at’ the door. But there was
scarcely an empty seat in the Town Hall,
and E. J. Tait smiled as one whose soul
has been washed in gold mingled with
frankincense and myrrh. The tenor is a
personable fellow, as much Irish as Scot in
appearance. It was in “Boheme” and
“Pagliacci” he ravished the hearts of his
women listeners, and his own junoesque,
fair wife (she is a daughter of Sweden),
who sat in the second row wrapped in a
silver coat, applauded as frankly as any.
Graham de Chair, tall and slim and wear-
ing the same holystoned look as Sir Dudley,
was introduced at a Government House
party to a melee of Sydney’s artistic and
social Who’s Who last week. The hand-
some old house was heady with spring
flowers—-with the pink and white of azaleas,
the aloof beauty of camellias and the frag-
rance of stock. But the dresses had rather
a blase look. Not. though, the serene beauty
of Mrs. Walter Swinson’s blue georgettes ;
they looked like the waters of Cremorne
when midday smiles sunnily. The Sheldon
lady, too, purred softly in briar pink velvets
from which usage had not worn the pile.
Violinist Dagmar Thompson, tall and fair in
wine-steeped chiffons, Greek of line, that
suggested Swinburne translated by Paris,
caught the eye.
Masons of the Eastern Suburbs showed
their loyalty to the Viking by a roll of deaf-
ening cheers at their ball the other night.
The whisper had gone round that Sir Dudley
was celebrating a birthday, and when he and
Lady de Chair arrived at the Moore Park
Palais a welcome volleyed out. The Worship-
ful Brothers, too. had all their scenery on,
and later formed a long trail by way of
which a pretty flutter of debs, arrived at the
Lxcellencies’ handshake. Some of the fledg-
lings were perhaps not unaware, despite their
lowered lashes, that a young naval sheik, Sub-
lieutenant de Chair, was close to sister
Elaine's side. Lady de Chair, in gold bro-
cades that flashed on the left side into
a Persian-red chiffon scarf, looked proudly
conscious of her son’s presence, and stepped
and slid and pivoted with him in the first
dance. Red is evidently the family’s glad-
some hue, for Elaine signalled her rejoicings
at her sailor-brother’s homecoming above red
georgettes. Poinsettia reds flashed through
a fine network of steel about Mrs. W. F.
Foster as she intoned the litany of the names
of the 20 or more debs into the vice-regal
ear, and red and gold shone bravely on Mrs.
John Goulston. These ladies, with their own
and many other Right Worshipful and Most
Worshipful brethren and their wives, were
clustered within glad-eye distance of their
Exes., and Margaret Osborne added fair good
looks above old Italian blue and silver to the
party from the Big House.
This is Peggy Dunbar, the smiling young-
ster whose rich contralto promises to be
an added joy to concert programmes in
Sydney.
Peggy, who is
a pupil o f
Lmjly Marks,
gave her first
public recital
in the King’s
Hall last
Saturday, and
allied her voice
triumph an 11 y
with the music
o f Handel.
Saint - Saens,
Brahms and a
group of old
Italian com-
posers. The
young singer
was introduced

one of Lady do
(’hair’s musi-
cal evenings.
Next mouth she joins forces with a concert
party touring the Northern Rivers.
A new racing eight is what Sydney High
hankers after, and Sydney High has a right
to it. Three times in succession has the
school crew rowed the winning eight in the
(t.P.S. Regatta, and now it wants a craft
worthy of the crew. Judging by the roll-
up of old hoys to the Wentworth the other
night the new skiff will lie in the school’s
boat-house at an early date. Old Old Boys
and young Old Boys and a group of the
school’s captains gathered about the model
of the desired eight, manned by a kewpie
crew dressed in chocolate and blue. The
medical Diethelms and the Arthur Waddells
entertained at the same board, and Head-
master Saxby and president of the Old Boys’
Union R. T. McKay were among their guests.
All cabarets are a success, of course, but
the cabaret for “Joey’s” the other afternoon
was a whale of a success. The Ambassadors
was already armed to the teeth with merry-
makers, when a battalion of schoolboys burst
into the dance —gay youngsters, energetic
youngsters, needing no Macquarie-street cer-
tificate to proclaim them free from arthritis
and locomotor-ataxia. The tables, too, added
to the gaiety, being gaudy with cerise snap-
dragons on a leash of blue ribbons. _ High
spirited skiffs in cerise and blue strained at
tlieir moorings on each table, and one was
riding to win on the lid of the box of choco-
lates that w-as Mayoress Mostyn’s capture.
The objective of the afternoon was anew
boat for the Rowing Club, and as there
didn’t seem a clear space anywhere except on
the ceiling, a deposit on the boat will be
available at once.
The young man of the moment is Sub-
Lieutenant Graham de Chair, who is spend-
ing a month’s leave with his people at
Cover nment
House. After
that lie joins
the MX. sloop ■
of-war Labur-
num. This is
the first time
for four years
that he anil
his fa mily
have met face
to face, and
mighty pleased
they are with
one another's
appearance if
beaming
glances tell a
true tale. The
young man
has served
with the Medi-
terrane an
Fleet for two
years, knows
the work in the destroyers, and has had a
fling in the Naval Air Service. He is tall,
fair, very like his father, and a good dancer.
Attached to this testimonial is May Moore’s
picture of the budding Admiral.
The Garrison sergeants held their annual
ball the other night in the big Drill Hall
in Victoria Barracks —a tremendous affair
with all hands on to the decorations for
days before. The orchestra was shrined in
a bower of roses and garlands of the same
blooms hung from the rafters, with masses
of palms as a background to the dancers.
Warrant-officers Russell and Webber were
chief hosts. Major Lenox brought his lady;
and Acting-Base Commandant Cox Taylor
and his lady, who are off to Tassy shortly,
were farewelled by a big gathering of
R.A.G.A.
Nor in a week of Spring doings must
the party given by Mayoress Mostyn pass
unnoted.’ Here flowers and music wove a
pleasant pattern in the hoary old reception
rooms at the Town Hall.
Quite a lot of bricks for the adult Deaf
and Dumb Hostel can be bought with the
takings of Harlequin’s supper-dance at the
Ambassadors last week. But Harlequin
wasn’t there. Harold Lloyd glasses and
bizarre false noses were flaunted, but the
cap and bells were missing. Mrs. Percy
Stewart Dawson, who was president of the
committee, wore her feleek velvets in the new
backless way; and the vice-president, Mrs.
J. McCredie, in rose georgettes heavily
fringed, hostessed a group whose frocking
suggested a flight of butterflies. A frock of
closely-woven crystal, so sparkling it might
have been the apparel of a Hans Andersen
snow queen, was one of the night’s most
admired. Phyllis Ingham attracted atten-
tion in a frock of rose and blue moire,
quaint as an early-Victorian valentine; and
one girl clad in sable hues gained an exotic
effect by coiling a gold snake collar about
her throat.
Brilliant student Alan Canny, who has just
polished off his medical course, persuaded
Isabel Ebsworth to agree to wear his choice
in engagement-rings on the day the results
of his finals came out. Alan is only son
of .T. P. Canny. N.S.W. branch inspector
of the National Bank, and was the brightest
star of Grammar in his day. Isabel is
the young eldest daughter of the Charlie
Ellsworths, of Edged iff. Woollahra. She is
tall, fair and good looking, and has inher-
ited father’s taste for sport. In his day
lie was captain of the Arsoma Football
Club and pulled a hefty oar.
Two more Alans who have just competed
successfully in the Cupid Stakes are Captain
Alan White, of the Royal Engineers and
Aide to the Governor of Ilong Kong; and
Alan McGregor, of Adelaide. The first has
won a promise from Ethel Campbell,
daughter of the late E. C. Campbell, of
Duntroon, Queanbeyan ; and smiling Nola
Kerr has made the S'Australian happy.
Singer Mascotte Ralston, of the .1. C.
Doubleyous, snapped her fingers at super-
stition and wore an all-black frock and hat.
relieved by furs and pink posy, for her wed-
ding. At the Registrar-General’s office she
became Mrs. Wonga P. Harris, with her
young-looking parents to give her away.
The great Synagogue flew a special line
in decorations for the wedding of Dulcie
Aroha Goulston, of Elizabeth Bay. last
week. Dulcie’s father is the Grand Master
of the Masonic Order in this State, and the
flowers and wedding arrangements were on a
scale that made the steeliest eye blink. The
bridegroom, Dr. Ilyam Maurice Owen, is
from Stanmore, and under the ministrations
of Rabbi Cohen, assisted by Brother Dang-
low, of Melbourne, the two were made one
to an exultant stream of choral music. The,
wedding garment was a sleeveless froth of
white georgette and silver, trailing off into
a foamy wash of silver tissue. An old lace
veil and a streaming armlet of white and
pink hyacinths and orchids were finishing-
touches. Sisters Peggy and Edna and Kitty
Owen floated after the bride in golden hues,
and Sep Owen, Dr. Alan Owen and Eric
Goulston stood by.
The Voice that. Breathed o'er Doris May
Reid and John F. Campbell the other night
at St. Stephen’s did it against a background
of massed white and pink blossom. The
pretty Neutral Bay girl went back to the
traditional ivory satin and lace for her
wedding garment. Her veil, too, was of
lace delicately embroidered in seed pearls,
and the flowers were white orchids and lily-
of-the-valley. Four 'maids, two in green
and two in pink, the dresses giving a Dres-
den Shepherdess effect with their tight
bodices and spreading tulle skirts, floated
in the wake of the bride, who was piloted
by father. He is S. G. Reid, formerly of
Mascotte station, Narrabri. Later Mrs.
Reid, frocked and hatted in sleek velvets,
bade the wedding guests welcome at the
Wentworth.
Ella Kathleen, daughter of Lieut.-Col.
and Mrs. Lorenzo, will take dad’s arm up
the aisle of St. James’s Church on Septem-
ber 10. The man waiting to claim her will
be Thomas Flate Shaw, of Melbourne, where
the nest will be. The cake will be cut in
the Officers’ Mess in Victoria Barracks.
There’s a nice bit of lonic architecture to
attract the passer-by in Dowling-street,
Surry Hills. It is the new Greek Orthodox
Cathedral, built at a cost of over £14,000 —
the Greek Archbishop opened it in a cere-
mony that spread over three hours. The
Greek community is entering more and more
into the spirit of the country of its adop-
tion ; the problem of supplying Kinder-
gartens is at the moment absorbing its
interest. The. energetic John Vrachnas is
mainly responsible for this.
One day last week the Victorian League
snared Janet Mitchell, the director of the
Thrift Department of the Government Sav-
ings Bank, with the promise of free tea and
toast. In the cathedral-like atmosphere of
the Women’s Club, surrounded by Leaguers
who looked like attendants on the God of
Plenty, she told the story of the penny
saved that is the penny gained—she had
just returned from America loaded with
hints as to how a nation may collect all
the money in the world.
Mary Marlow is just qbout to see her
latest novel, “An Unofficial Rose,” bloom
at her from the bookstalls.
Next Wednesday night baritone Murray
Gibbes will sing a programme of his own
compositions at St. James’s Ilall in aid of
Rose Day appeal for the United Charities.
One of a trio of firm pals who alwmys
moved about the w r orld together has slipped
quietly out into the Beyond. He was Words-
worth James, father of popular Lieut.-Col.
“Jimmy” James, of the R.A.G.A. The trio
came back to Sydney—they are well known
as former residents of Adelaide —last year
when Colonel “Jimmy” returned after two
years as exchange-officer with British artil-
lery. Mrs. Wordsworth James, by the way,
is a great-grand-daughter of the poet Crabbe
and a grand-niece of the gentle Wordsworth.
Dr. Fred Barnet, accidentally electrocuted
the other day while attending a patient, was
a grandson of the late James Barnet, N.S.W.
Government architect in the days when side-
whiskers were the vogue. The Rev. Donald
Barnet, a noted classical scholar and this
year Moderator of the kirk, is an uncle of
the late doctor, who was only 83 at the time
of his tragic death.
An intimate knowledge of the Law doesn’t
seem to help a woman much in choosing a
husband. On a voyage from Australia bril-
liant Sybil Morrison met a man who per-
suaded her that he owned a ranch in
America. The story must have been a plau-
sible one, for Sybil Gibbs, as she then was,
with all her training in weighing the pros
and cons of statements made to her. could
find no flaw in it. The two married, and
returned to Australia. Then the husband
prepared to let his clever and moneyed wife
support him in the style to which he had
been accustomed. The lady objected, and
the husband departed—to turn up again
when Sybil’s mother died, asking what the
old lady was worth to them. The usual
decree was granted last week.
Mrs. Maclurcan, high priestess of the
Wentworth, is playing also fairy god-mother
to the Daffodil cabaret for the Red Cross
next week.

The oil fire depicted above occurred
in Holland, and was extinguished in
1 \ minutes with Firefoam. It is
typical of many conflagrations which
more and more frequently bring home
the fact that all fires are not alike, and
that apparatus which affords excellent
protection for one risk may be quite
useless for another.
The Foamite Method of Fire Pro-
tection is of proved efficiency, even in
the case of outbreaks involving the
most inflammable spirits; also quickly
and effectively smothers out any
ordinary fire.

The V.A.T.C. races were quite spoilt by
the flying grit that went everywhere and
annoyed everybody including the gee-gees.
Four horses fell in the hurdle race, and one
was killed —and the dust got some of the
blame. There was no encouragement to
women to expose the latest in gowns or mil-
linery to such a sirocco. One brave woman
donned a new model hat of large dimensions
of plaid straw and silk that flip-flopped in
the breeze and looked perilously insecure,
and the happiest girls on the lawn were two
who wore the new helmet style millinery
with ear-flaps, which’ needed no clutching-
hand to keep them in place. The tweed
tailored suit and the ensemble gown had a
day out again, for it was hardly cool enough
for top-coats or furs. Vice-royalty was
absent, but the committee-box was well
filled. Mrs. James Grice had with her Mrs.
Frank Rolandson, a slim, dark-eyed young
matron attired in a black cloth suit and
black felt hat. Mrs. Merson Cooper lent
smartness to the scene with a grebe collared
black coat over a fawn gown, topped by a
small upturned hat of putty hue with a black
and fawn feather adornment. A navy suit
allied to a lime-hued crinoline straw hat was
Mrs. T. A. Tabart’s choice; accompanying
her was Mrs. Dorothy Camperbell of Tas-
mania, who has come to reside for a while
in this city. Mrs. E. M. Pearce, in ensemble
covering of a pretty green tone, and Mrs.
Ben Chaffev were others in the committee
reserve. Mrs. Percy Blackbourn wore the
latest in jewellery, a thin gold snake that
wound itself round her throat and slid down
the frills of her suit front. Mrs. W. M.
Robins wore black and white most success-
fully. Some Tassie visitors to Melbourne in-
cluded Ida Lane of Devonport and Enid
Elliston of Launceston. Several fair sports
brightened sombre raiment with posies of
primroses.
The Findon Harriers’ “Point to Point”
meeting in Bournfleld Park was blessed with
wonderful weather. Hubert Miller, M.F.H.,
was host at a luncheon at which the Somerses
and the Davidsons vcere guests. Her Lx.
wore an exceedingly trim suit of brown and
fawn check tweed with a tan-colored felt
hat. George Fairbairn’s lady, just back from
London, topped a fur-collared speckled tweed
coat with a wine-hued felt hat. The Miller
lady, Mrs. Lyster Jackson, whose daughter,
Hylda McCardel, .was one of the riders,
General Blarney and his wife, she a sym-
phony in powder-blue cloth and grey fur, and
the Harold Luxton couple were patrons.
Gwen Johnston showed her horsemanship by
winning the Findon Ladies’ Cup. The 13
lasses wh o rode in the event stuck to their
mounts like professionals, and there were no
falls. Doreen Fairchild and Ethel Charley
filled second and third places in the steeple-
chase. which was restricted to riders who
had taken part in at least six hunts during
the season.
A dull grey morning and a frigid breeze
made early arrivals at last week’s Hunt
Club race meeting at Moonee Valley sorry
they had come, but after the first race tin;
sun shone cheerfully, and gloom was cast
aside. There was the usual array of smart
tailor-made suits. Dr. and Mrs. Grantley
Shelton, Dr. and Mrs. A. E. Syme, of Lily-
dale, Aileen and Madge Taylor, of Over-
newton, Alison Madden. Vera Whiting and
Doris Foster were on tlie lawn.
Ormond College held the last of the Uni.
hops of this season at St. Kilda Town Hall
on Friday night. The scarlet, black and gold
colors of the college were draped about panels
adorned with heraldic devices. The Master,
D. R. Picken, with his wife, who wore
glistening nattier blue, welcomed guests from
other college houses. Dr. J. C. A r . Behan’s
life-partner, a study in pinks in lace
and georgette; Dr. F. H. Campbell’s wife,
in a scintillating black gown, and Mrs. Foe-
nauder, in a frock of pink and mauve, were
among the consorts of invited dons. Margery
Herring, lately resigned from Janet Clarke
Hall, danced in a sparkling gown of peacock
blue. Alison Darling struck an original
note with black and gold embroidery on a
begonia red gown; Lynette Henderson was
a flutter of white tulle, silver, and crystal;
and Betty Clarke was an attractive maiden
in a blend of delf blue and mauv e velvet.
Opalescent pailettes that radiated upon
cherry red sheathed Carmen Hills.
The Tweddle Home benefited by a hop
arranged last week by some of its helpers,
Mrs. D. O. Toole being head of the organis-
ing committee. Her gown of vernal green
had a sprinkling of silver. The lion, sec.,
Mrs. H. C. Forge, was clad in delphinium
blue georgette, and Mrs. McD. Martin, the
lion, treas., was in a black beaded robe. The
new Mayoress of Footscray, Mrs. D. Mc-
Cormack, was there in a black gown, and
Matron Moreland was amongst the dancers.
Air Force officers’ womenfolk, banded as
an auxiliary of the District Nurses’ Society,
held a hop on Friday night at the kiosk
in Fawkner Park, South Yarra. Pilots and
navigators were Mrs. Williams, the president,
whose black glistening gown bore a trail
of petunia-pink flowers; lion. sec. Mrs. P. E.
Coleman, with a red rose perched on a
shoulder of her black robe; and lion, treas.
Mrs. W. Murray, in blue chiffon-velvet and
gold lame. Mrs. W. S. Warne, who is lion,
sec. of the auxiliary, was clothed in matrix-
blue with a bridge-coat in Iceland-poppy
tones of brocade. Mrs. Cecil McKay’s frock
of black taffeta wandered to a tulle hem
that supported stray sprays of blossoms.
Mrs. M. P. Alsop’s Japanese cloak was worn
over pink and sparkling raiment.
Mrs. Henry 11. Kinnear, wearing petunia-
liued raiment, decorated with gold thread
and silk braid, and a hat of cyclamen tone,
was tea-distributor at the Austral Salon’s
last afternoon. Greeting was given to Wyn
Richmond, leading lady of “Sunny,” and
her lately-acquired husband, John Hender-
son. The youthful mummer wore a dull-
green, fur-collared coat, topped by a honey-
colored straw hat. There was music.
An afternoon-tea party at Scott’s gave the
English-Speaking Union an opportunity to
meet the visiting American medicoes, Ivavanel
and Elliott, and Monsignor Barry Doyle,
from the Ould Sod. Professor Osborne said
words of welcome. Monsignor Doyle’s clerical
cloak of purple and his array of military
and civil decorations were much admired,
and so was his eloquence as a beggar for
the orphans of what the English call the Near
East. Dr. Ethel Osborne, whose slate-grey
costume was brightened with coral pink,
lent her husband a hand. At the chief table
with its baskets of fruit blossom were sur
geon George Syme and his lady, Mrs. Harold
Clapp, the E.S.U. secretary, Richard Gipps
and his wife, General McCay and the Con-
sul-General for U.S.A.
Cards and a cafe chantant brought a gay
crowd to Cliveden Mansions on Thursday
afternoon, the object being to help the cause
of a permanent orchestra. The moving spirits
were Mrs. T. G. White, who has forsaken
her pasturage for a time and is domiciled at
the fashionable fiats, and Mrs. Percy Russell.
Both wore black satin. Mrs. Barry Thomson.
Mrs. Alec Lane and Mrs. Skinner lent rooms
of their apartments for the overflow of
patrons. The University Con. string quar-
tette, tenor Walter Kirby, Mrs. George
Haines, with her chirpy songs at the piano,
Laurence Burnett, pianist Margaret Suther-
land and Thelma Neill figured on the musical
menu. Sales of oddments helped the pro-
ceeds. The Morell lady. Donna Grbssardi,
Dr. Georgina Sweet and Mrs.- James Alston
were well to the fore.
Mrs. T. A. Tabart, wife of the secre-
tary of the V.A.T.C., pictured here by
Lafayette, is president of the Armadale
and Malvern
branch of the
Women's Hos-
pital Auxil-
iary. Her first
enterprise on
behalf of the
institution was
a fete and
cafe chantant
in one of the
stands at Caul-
field racecourse
which brought
in £lOOO. The
other day she
engineered a
ball, aided by
a quartette of
girls, including
her daughters
Edna a n d
Pixie, which
gave the hos-
pital some
more much-needed assistance.
There was bridge, music and tea at the
Oriental the other afternoon when the
organising ability of Mrs. Pohlman and her
daughter Dorothy ensured a good crowd
and a good time for all, with a handsome
cheque for Melbourne Hospital. Raymond
Lambert, the pianist, offered his services
as a compliment to the hostess. Mrs. Edward
Dyson and Madeleine Knight sang; Amy
Luceni, a school-girl pianist of promise,
played ; and there were items by that capable
musician May Broderick and elocutionist
Rene Bartley. There were sales of flowers
and sweets and raffle tickets, and Norman
Lee found the role of auctioneer a strenuous
one.
The Janet Clarke Hall fund received finan-
cial help from a performance of “Pygmalion
and Galatea” put on by pupils of the C. of
E. Girls’ Grammar School at headquarters
one evening last week. Lady Somers, Mrs.
E. 11. Davidson and Mayoress Morell were
in the front row. Arcligaiters Lees was one of
the speakers. Monica Levich made a good
Pygmalion, and Jane Harper was a much-
alive Galatea. The Miller lady, Dr. and Mrs.
Charles Bage, Mrs. A. Deeper with Val and
Mollie, and the headmistress, Miss K. Gil-
man Jones, blessed the cause with their pre-
sence.
A card party at the Lyceum Club added
a few hundred shillings to the fund that is
being piled up to establish a permanent
orchestra. Mrs. F. W. Eggleston, who wore
a black embroidered robe, and Mrs. R. Mc-
Millan, whose covering of pale pink was
crystal sprinkled, were the chief engineers.
Mayor Morell and his lady, she in a coat of
silver tissue trimmed with grey fur, over
a frock of slate-grey georgette, brought then-
daughter Sheila. Mrs. Herbert Brookes was
one of the players.
This is Beryl Ainslie, president of the
Junior Music-Makers’ League, which was
brought into being to aid the Million Shil-
lings Fund that is to give Melbourne a per-
manent orchestra. Miss Ainslie’s first effort
was the organ-
ising of a bal
masque that
b rought in
many hun-
dreds of sliil-
lings. Now
she’s planning
a mannequin-
para d e, at
which the
choicest trea-
sures of the
Collins - street
and Bourke-
street empo-
riums will be
displayed o n
the forms of
society lasses
of the right
sizes and
shapes. Mrs.
Ferguson, Mrs.
Percy Russell,
artist George Bell’s wife and Una Ryan are
assisting.
Prof. Alexander Gunn’s talk about
Anatole France was tbe main feature of the
Victoria League’s latest gathering at the
Windsor. French Consul Rene Turck returned
thanks. Madame Turck’s well-marcelled
shingle above a gold lame coat decorated
the front row. Mrs. J. S. Fraser, whose
frock was hidden beneath gold and black
brocade ; the Maudsley lady : the Masson lady,
in black lace draperies; Mrs. Gunn, wrapped
in peacock-blue velvet; Colonel and Mrs.
Manning, of W.A.; Marney Clarke, Dr. and
Mrs. Rage and Mrs. Edward Bage were
among the interested listeners.
Mrs. Fritz Hart, who planned the dresses
for the production, of Beethoven’s “Fidelio
at the Playhouse by the Melba Con. Opera
Society, achieved a charming color effect
in the* Spanish-peasant ensemble. Gaily
colored skirts, white blouses and the inevit-
able laced velvet bodice were happily blended.
Greta Callow, who was the Marcellina of
the first performance, tv as attractive in a
frock of gerartium-pink satin with white
apron and fichu. lesis Brown played Leon-
ora, in dark violet apparel. Among the first-
nighters were the Governor and Lady Somers,
she in apricot georgette with a kolinsky coat,
Mrs. Donald Mackinnon and her daughter
Marie, Professor Bernard Ileinze, Mrs. Fritz
Hart and Basil, and Mrs. Carty Salmon.
The “Hamlet” matinees at the Theatre
Royal were attractively produced and cos-
tumed. Zillah Bateman as Ophelia let
her unbound golden tresses stray over a
trained gown of sea-green hue, which she
wore even for the Mad scene. A pall of
crimson velvet over her corpse in burial
scene was a striking touch. Eardley Turner
and Mildred Cottell made a most imposing
Royal couple in ermine-bordered robes of
ruby hue. Peter Gawtliorne’s height and
dignity fitted well the sable raiment of the
disgruntled Prince.
A Sydney soprano, Gwen Selva, lately
back from England, sang French and Span-
ish songs in costume at her recital in the
ballroom of Grong Grong, the Toorak home
of the Tliomas Smiths. The apartment was
decorated with black and white draperies
and figures in silhouette, and the stage,
decked with tapestries and foliage, made
an effective background for the artist’s
many changes of attire. For her Spanish
offerings a black-flounced gown was worn.
Leaf-green velvet and lace was her attire for
a group of modern English songs. Gertrude
Ilealy fiddled a Handel sonata and some
other pieces. William Burrell accompanied
the two performers and many flowers were
handed up.
St. Glare Grondona and his young wife
(Peggy Hyland that was) have made a bad
beginning in Loudon. Both are on the sick-
list. She contracted throat trouble on the
honeymoon and was brought back for an
operation. Before she began to pick up, her
husband's old war wounds became so trouble-
some that he was hurried off for treatment to
a military hospital. At latest they were
cheering each other with bulletins of progress.
Camellias and violets decked the damask
at the Oriental when the Douglas Stephens
couple gave luncheon to Dr. Kavanel anu
Professor Elliott. Mrs. Kavanel wore grey
with squirrel-fur and nigger-brown hat. Pro-
fessor Osborne and his wife, Dr. and Mrs.
Stanley Argyle and some others were guests.
Dr Claude Morlet, eldest son of Mrs.
Morlet, of Camperdown, who hangs out a
brass plate on St. George’s-terrace, Perth, lias
sent home the news of his engagement to
Mildred Milbank of that city.
The George Langridges are rejoicing
over the visit of their daughter, who went
to Penang and became Mrs. A. J. 1 lumps.
She has brought back a baby girl, and taken
a house near the parental roof at Arm ad am
for her stay, which will last till the Malayan
dry season sets in.
The Arts and Crafts Society’s show,
opened on Friday afternoon, is rich in
examples of hand-weaving from this and
other States. Jean McKenzie, Miss Booth
of Sydney, and Misses Lorrimer and Bates
of S.A. are represented. Beautifully-blended
colorings in stripes form supper-sets, scarves,
curtains, cushion-covers and other joyous-
looking articles. The show also demonstrates
that the rag mat can be made a thing of
beauty. Hand-woven samples of woollen rugs
are among the exhibits. An interesting little
corner is that where Miss Langdon has
fixed up a wee nursery with daintily-con-
structed furniture of pale lemon hue with
a dash of blue. There are a cot, a cupboard,
a screen and a few other trifles. The bath
is blue, with a dado of fish inside, repeated
on the ends of the bath-towels. A procession
of the beasts of the jungle in silhouette
forms a low frieze on the blue wall-paper.
A raffia-bag competition brought in sonic
rather disappointing entries, but the prize
offered for a chair made of bush products
rallied up some very pretty rustic seats.

The birth of twin sons to the Paddy
Osbornes this week makes grand-aunts of the
Madden women. Twins seem to run m the
Ryrie family. The young mother was one
of Granville’s twin daughters. An aunt
made a similar contribution to the popu-
lation. and so did a grandmother. Early in
the new year the young parents propose, visit-
ing England—to see how father is getting on
in liis new job of High. Commissioner.
An Australian who was at the premiere
of "The Climax'’ at the Little Theatre,
London, cables that Dorothy Brunton
received a great welcome from a packed

Adele Crane of the very high top-note, who
was lately promoted to touring lead in "The
Cousin from Nowhere." has had a serious
illness, but she is now beginning to smile
again, and is looking forward to taking the
road some time this month. She was a
student of Albert Con.
Another society girl has found her vocation
on the boards. She is Beatrice Fisher, who,
after a, brief trial of matrimony decided on
a stage career and made an intelligent
beginning with Moscovitch. In the “Hamlet
matinees at the Theatre Royal she makes
a brave show as the Player Queen, and the
management thinks highly of its newest
recruit.
A note from London :
Father Ronayne, 0.C.C., now of Rome but for long
a favorite in South Melbourne, M. J. Doyle, of
Adelaide, and D. Ryan, also from the sunny South,
were among the crowd of priests who marched before
the Countess de Markiewicz’s coffin on the day of
her funeral. De Valera's tribute was nicely
phrased: “Madame Markiewicz is gone from us —
Madame, the friend of the toiler, the lover of the
poor. Ease and station she put aside, and took the
hard way of service with the weak and downtrodden.
Sacrifice, misunderstanding- and scorn lay on tlie
road she adopted, but she trod it unflinchingly.”
It took seven motor-vans to convey the floral offer-
ings, many of which were from the very poor with
whom the Countess had regularly shared her income
and by whom she was adored. They stood in
thousands all night outside the Rotunda, where her
body lay in state.
An early-autumn setting was given to tlie
wedding of Dorothy Mitchell, elder daughter
of Dr. and Mrs. 11. St. J. Mitchell, of East
Malvern, and Major NY. H. Coulter, of Syd-
ney. The leading lady wore biscuit georg-
ette over which trailed a veil of tulle of
the same color, anchored to a gold bandeau
speckled with brown and rust blooms. Sister
Eleanor ’maided it in cherry georgette and
ecru lace, and two small girls, Moira Cres-
wick and Kathleen Mitchell, wore in frocks
of the same hue, with capes of velvet. The
after-reception was held at Yarr’mn, the
Toorak home of the A. T. Creswicks.
The flowers of spring decked the wedding
of Dr. Elvie Carnegie, elder daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. David Carnegie, and Capt. 11.

Idealism
QENTURIES ago British Cathedrals were built
with meticulous care —as symbols of service,
as monuments of idealism.
The British-built Leyland Lorry of to-day is
constructed with the same regard for high ideals.
In the sphere of commerce and industry it
stands as a symbol of service in modern road
transport.
Sterling worth is carefully built into each unit
that it may fulfil its mission without fail, no matter
where its service may be demanded.
Powerful, dependable, efficient, the Leyland
Lorry reaches the highest ideal of twentieth-
century haulage.
RECENT LEYLAND SALES.
These include six 5-ton Tipping Lorries to the
N.S.W. Government for work on Sydney City
Railway, three 5-ton Lorries to the Public Works
Department for use on the North Shore Bridge
approaches. The N.S.W. State Brick Works
have also augmented their fleet of Leylands by
four 4-ton Lorries.

In Captain Robert Gee, Y.C., who
resigned his scat in the British Parliament
to become a settler on a block near Mul-
lewa, Westralia considers it lias the
ideal migrant. Gee announces himself as
absolutely, without a grievance. He was 22
years in the ranks of the Royal Fusiliers,
but won a commission in 1915. lie was for
two years on the staff of the 29tli. one of
the hardest lighting of the British divisions
in France.
A rather unusual mixture was the life of
Harris Jacob Solomon, who died in Bal-
main, Sydney, the other day. When Solo-
mon landed from Poland as a young man he
sought the wide spaces and with his partner,
H. G. Hatfield, founded the little town of
Angledool. Th e Hatfields are still its lead-
ing citizens. Solomon sold out and bought a
Sydney suburban hotel. He left that to be-
come a cordial manufacturer, and later
disposed of the soft-drinks business and took
on his last enterprise—pawnbroking.
An old political warliorse carries Labor’s
standard in Coogee, a Sydney suburban seat
that looks safe for Nationalism. Tom
Brown was a leading light in the first Poli-
tical Labor League, formed in 1890, and got
into Parliament in 1894 as member for Con-
dobolin. When the Commonwealth was born
lie transferred to the bigger field and was
returned for Canobolas. He afterwards-
represented Calare, but was subsequently
defeated and returned to State politics as
member for Lachlan in 1913.
When John Read Hedditch passed over at
Portland Yic. lost one of its oldest links with
the Henty days. His father had charge of
the first C. of E. Grammar School in the
whaling settlement in 1840. The fifth genera-
tion now resides at the old home, which is
somewhat of a record in a young land. And
John’s death is the first in the family for
64 years; the last time Hedditchcs went into
mourning was when John’s brother was
drowned while rescuing the crew from \
wreck in Discovery Bay.
A man whose backbone is good mate for
a rifle-barrel is Major Wallingford, a
blue-eyed Englishman who has retired, after
16 years of it, from the job of teaching young
Maorilanders how to shoot. His dad was a
sergeant of the Rifle Brigade, and taught all
he knew about the old Martini to his off-
spring, who rewarded him by winning the
European rifle championship, the Imperial
Army rifle championships (six times) and
the Army revolver championship (twice).
Maori I and bought him in 1911. He had a
busy time on Gallipoli. It is estimated that
about 11,000 ladies of the harem and 70,000
of their Offspring were bereaved as a result
of “Wally’s” activity as a sniper.
“Basra”: While a timber-cutter of Bol-
warrali (Yic.) was working in the bush a
tree fell unexpectedly, stunning him and
pinning him to the ground. When he re-
covered consciousness he found his kelpie
dog whining and scratching at the tree as
if he would release his master. With great
difficulty lie managed to extract an old
letter from his waistcoat-pocket and to pen-
cil on the envelope a few words telling of his
plight. Rolling the message in Ins Hand-
kerchief, he tied it round the kelpie’s neck
and sent him home. The dog’s excited
actions soon attracted attention; the letter
was found, and a search-party was quickly
guided by the dog to where the injured man
was lying, suffering from severe injuries to
the head and back.
John Jinks was absent from the Irish
Parliament of his own choice. But Blank
M.L.A. (he is still in politics), once saved
the face of a N.S.W. Government against
his will. Heads had been counted, and the
Government whip decided that Blank would
have to be missing from the Opposition
ranks when the division was taken that
evening. Blank’s domestic affairs formed a
vicious circle: his fondness for other women
was enough to make any wife wild, and
his wife’s virulence was enough to make any
man seek consolation elsewhere. At this
time he had been absent from home
for a week. Word was sent to Mrs. Blank
that her husband was in the House. She
came down in a cab. The Whip saw to it
that Blank got advance information, know-
ing that regulations and prohibitions counted
nothing to his irate spouse. Blank fled into
the Domain. Long before it was safe for
him to return the Government had scraped
through.
“W.P.D.”: The Queensland Irrigation
Commissioner wants the Commmonwealth
Development and Migration Commission to
recommend a loan from the £34,000,000 to be
advanced by Britain for development work
in the States, to be used for the completion
of the Dawson Valley Irrigation scheme,
which will cost about £4,000,000. State
irrigation schemes in Australia have all been
financial frosts, and I hope Mr. Gepp
will turn down the proposition to use
money on a thing which is not needed
now nor will be for the next 50 years. We
have in Queensland an immense area of land
(much of it of excellent quality) between
the Tweed Heads and Cooktown, 1100 miles
north, most of which is practically in the
same condition to-day as it was when it
was taken from the blacks. It is well
watered by numerous ever-flowing rivers, has
a reliable rainfall ranging from 50 to 150
inches annually, and has a climate well suited
for fruit-growing, dairying, farming or cross-
bred wool production. If a reasonable scheme
were put into operation for the development
of this land, its productive capacity could
be increased almost without limit. A similar
scheme was carried out in Scotland for the
draining of useless swampy country. A
commission advanced money to owners for
drainage purposes at 2 \ per cent, interest
and a small redemption charge over a long
period. Landowners readily accepted the
plan, and what were waste lands are now
excellent farming country.

£l7OO PRIZE STORY COMPETITION.
“The Bulletin” wants the Australian novel to take the place of
the American and English productions which now flood the bookshops.
A school of short-story writers has been built up in Australia
through “The Bulletin’s” efforts during more than 45 years past.
Now “The Bulletin” is going to see whether a school of novelists
cannot also be built, up.
To this end it offers a minimum of £l7OO in prizes for novels
during the next three years.
The first competition will close on June 30, 1928. For this the
prizes will be: First, £500; 2nd, £125; 3rd, £75.
All persons Australian-born are eligible; also all persons bona fide
resident in Australia.
The stories are to be available for serial publication in “The
Bulletin” and “The Woman’s Mirror.” Otherwise, copyright will
belong wholly to the writer; all picture riehts will likewise remain Ins
property.

the bride’s parents, was banked with season-
able blooms. The bride wore a lengthy
trained gown of white satin, embroidered at
intervals in gold, with a veil of Brussels
lace. Her attendants, Elizabeth Binnie, of
Sydney, and sister Dorothy, wore frocks of
lemon-hued taffeta, their posies of pansies
blending with head swathings of gold and
autumn-toned tulle. Little John Peck, in a
white satin suit, was page. After the honey-
moon Capt. Morris will go back to his regi-
ment in Central India, and his wife will join
him later.

The Goodwins were at the Dickens Fellow-

Dr. Cumbrae Stewart, gave the welcome,
Jean Trundle arranged a short play, "The
Cratcliits’ Christmas Dinner,” and E. J.

John presented some essay prizes.
Blue and gold was the background of the
dance given in All Saints’ hall by Too-
woomba Grammar’s Old Boys’ Brisbane
branch. Asparagus-fern and school badges
decked the walls.
Asligrove Church of England staged a
dance to help to reduce its building debt. On
the same evening there was an arched canopy
of many-lmed streamers, and the walls were
draped with flags and wreaths of bright
bougainvillaea. Judge Woolcock's wife judged
the fancy dresses. Joyce Cooper, as “Tintex,”
won the first prize for girls,
Toowoomba bachelors and spinsters have
been disporting in the Show Grounds pavi-
lion at a ball, where the entrance-hall was
lined with flags and houghs. From a hoop
of gold overhead hung a tented canopy of
gold ribbons ; lamp-shades of black and gold
and a canopy of red, apricot and daffodil
were over the buffet. Cinnabar shades
screened the supper-room lights and Iceland
poppies and violets were on the tables. Bal-
loons and brass bowls of poppies were deco-
rative items. Mrs. E. King and Mrs.
Stanley Nolan were presented with bouquets
of pink sweet-peas in tulle holders. Quite a
number of Brisbane people were there.
For tlie visiting ' N.S.W. and Victorian
bowlers there was a musicalc at Vaughan’s.
Daphne Sapsford gave a solo dance, and there

to make the show original and attractive.
Each form ran an enterprise of its own. In
the ugly-man competition the headmaster
came second. The war-memorial and other
school funds benefited.
The Midlands have been in the limelight
lately. Not long after the Steeplechase
gaieties came the Nicholson-Taylor wedding,
which united two of the oldest families in the
district. The youthful bride was Nancy,
elder daughter of the John Taylors of Win-
lon, the ’groom being Athol, youngest son of
the late Norman and Mrs. Nicholson,
Streanshalh. The bridal gown was of white
georgette, heavily beaded at the scalloped hem
with oxidised beads, and a feature was a
thickly-beaded girdle with long ends. The
square train, lined with pale-pink georgette,
was embroidered with roses in beadwork, and
a head-dress of pearls, crystal and orange
buds surmounted the heirloom veil of lovely
Limerick lace. Sister Mary and Alison Cam-
eron ’maided in beige lace and georgette, with
powder-blue velvet sashes at the low waist-
line, and hats of powder-blue fine straw and
velvet. About 200 guests motored out to
Campbelltown.
The women who brought up the question
of widows’ pensions at Priminister Bruce’s
meeting were far from satisfied with the
reply. The W.N.P. League has battled away
on this subject for a long time, and at the
inter-State Women’s Conference held in Syd-
ney last May, the Australian Federation of
Women Voters unanimously passed a resolu-
tion, brought forward by the Tasmanian dele-
gates, advocating Commonwealth pensions for
necessitous Australian widows with depen-
dent children. Mr. Bruce vaguely shifted the
subject to national insurance, but that will
not meet the case for many years.
A young Tasmanian singer, lesis Brown,
scored a success in the Melbourne Con. Opera
Society’s performance of “Fidelio” lately,
and critics predict a great future for her,
given good chances of training and develop-
ment. She is a pupil of Essie McMichael,
of the M6lba Con.

Friedman has come and gone, playing to
far smaller audiences than our alleged repu-
tation for culture warranted, and bringing
thereby a rap on the knuckles from Melba —
a rap partly for us and partly for those who
designed our draught-ridden and icy concert-
halls. These she castigates as cruel alike
to audience and artist, but they are barely
sufficient excuse for the proportion of empty
seats that have faced men of the calibre of
Zimbalist and Friedman. The Dame herself
was at one of the Friedman concerts, armed
with a laurel wreath, and Lady Bridges
has been at all of them. They have been to
the Heysens’, too, and to Mount Lofty, where
they lunched with Miss Waite and went on
afterwards to see Mr. Cowell’s collection of
Sturgess pictures. At Government House
the Dame had a talk with Marjorie Walsh,
a Con. pupil who gave an excellent account
of herself at the S.A. Orchestra’s Wagner
concert and whom she advises to go abroad.
Before the end of the year, by the way, we
may have a Melba concert.
Mrs. Iledley Todd, a visitor from England
who has been sojourning in the Eastern
States for the last month or two, is staying
with her niece, Mrs. Guy Fisher, at Mount
Lofty. Other returned voyagers are Mrs.
Sidney Ayers and Estelle Edwards, who have
done a round trip via Colombo, the Malay
States, Singapore and Java, taking in the
Pahang jungle on the way.
There has been tea-drinking and present-
giving in honor of Valerie Sanderson at Mrs.
Colin Trevor’s home in North Adelaide.
Phyllis O’Hal lor an was the hostess.
A sheaf of congratulations went to Mrs.
Herbert Rymill on her win at Kooyonga.
She is easily the club’s best feminine player,
and one of the most popular. And, like her
husband, she is a keen worker in the interests
of the game as well as a good golfer.
The exodus eastwards for Victorian golf
has left us a dull week here, but the Henley
Beach Sailing Club has had its annual jazz-
ing and there has been a Movie Ball for
local charities at the Palais. The Hospital
Auxiliary, launched by the Moulden lady
three years ago, has had its annual meeting
and given an excellent account of itself. It
has achieved its first objective and provided
new linen throughout the hospital (a little
matter of 7500 articles) : it has spent nearly
£5500 on material, and it has over £BOOO
put away towards a woman’s wing. Mrs.
T. R. Scarfe has been elected a life-member
for signal services.
The Duncan gift of Strathspey for a Uni.
residential college marks the passing into
public hands of another of our well-known
homes. Cheek-by-jowl with Urrbrae, once
the Waites’ domicile and now the Agricul-
tural Research Institute, it was one of the
most hospitable houses here, and one of
the most attractive. Over its sloping garden
and park there is a wide view to the sea,
and the spreading grounds give room for
expansion of the building. This State’s debt
to its Scottish colonists and their descendants
is a vast one, and it is a debt for service as
well as for gifts in cash and kind.

has a breath of the Great Open Spaces about it —the
“pictures’” great open spaces... .M.C. (St. Helens,
Tas.) : Far safer to use rhyme; it takes an uncom-

description of the “greedy sea” made rejection a

ful burst of penitence:—
She was my loved, my darling wife,

THE INKY WAY.
“Coot": Snappy headlines? Melbourne
Mousing Post headed the cable that Aus-
tralian meat is being sold in England as the
M.L. article “Lamb in Kiwi’s Clothing.”
Hobart Mercury advt.:—
Salesman wanted to sell advertising space on re-
putable proposition; aggiesshe man can make £3
a day for limited period.
L'nt:l lie is thrown downstairs hard enough
to make him a hospital case?
“Baomata”: Sydney Sun (25/8/’27) has
the following in a paragraph about the
returned soldiers’ settlement at the Red
Cliffs:—
This week a block of 135 acres sold for more than
£135 an acre. The land is irrigated by water
from the Murray River, and grows dried fruit.
Even the late Luther Burbank never got
quite as far as that.
“Yufu”: I've had one manuscript come
back nine times; it was accepted on the
tenth by the very paper that was the first,
to refuse it. It was re-submitted by a
mistake, too. There’s another record I’m
even proud of: I submitted 42 short stories
to Tiie Bulletin before I got one by. Can
anybody beat that?
“ILK.” : Tile first intimation that evening
journalism had arrived in England was on
May 11, IGBS, when Ichabod Banks an-
nounced at the end of his News Letter that
he would in future not publish it "until
four or five in the evening on post nights,”
so that he might include the principal occur-
rences of the day. His was a manuscript
journal of a type that survived for a con-
siderable time after the invention of print-
ing. London’s first iirinted evening pap r
made its appearance in 1700 under the title
of the Evening Post.
“Iford”: Journalists are among the per-
sons who may claim exemption from jury
service in some, though not all, parts of the
Commonwealth. But it isn’t always easy to
decide what constitutes a journalist. I recall
a murder trial in a Westralian goldfields
town being hung up for half an hour while
Judge and counsel solemnly debated ;i
citizen’s claim to be included in the inky
fraternity on the ground of having reported
several cricket and football matches for a
local paper. Finally it was decided that
he wasn’t a journalist within the meaning
of the Act, and into the jury-box he had to
go.
“Skyrider”: Pending the meeting of the
Federal Parliament the various pressmen
stationed at Canberra have had little or no-
thing to do except to interview the Chief
Commissioner, John Butters, and receive his
daily assurance that all’s well in what lie is
convinced is the best of all possible capitals.
Every morning at 10.30 a group of Inky
Wayfarers beard S’Jokn in bis den, regard-
less of the fact that he is unlikely to be able
to tell them anything they don’t know. The
number of interviewers lias been gradually
increasing as the time draws near for Par-
liament to assemble in its new home; last
week there were no less than seven scramb-
ling for crumbs.
“Brian Fitzpatrick” (Bond.) : It is high
time someone let Inky Wayfarers know what
they may expect of Fleet-street, which, judg-
ing from the appalling frequency of Aus-
tralian arrivals during the last 12 months,
has become the Mecca of every young writer
and journalist who can beg, buy or borrow
a passage to England. Where a few years
ago there were seven evening newspapers
in London, to-day there are three —one to
each of three combines. The Daily
Graphic disappeared last year, and
Graphic men are still starving. London is
left with 11 morning papers (seven Tory,
three Liberal and one Labor) and perhaps
a dozen Sunday papers. These last have
little to offer. The agencies cover most ot
their domestic news, and the tiny staff of
spacemen accounts for the i-est. On the
majority of the dailies a journalist cannot
be confident of keeping his job from one
month’s end to another. The Liberal papers
are doing so badly that they cannot afford
a large staff-expenditure—one of them, to
my certain knowledge, has an outdoor staff
of precisely seven men, some of them on
space. On the three London news-agencies
there is not, I think, a single Australian,
and it is unlikely that there ever will be.
An agency man, although his pay is lower,
is in general a better pressman than the
daily newspaper man, and he must know
London inside-out.
ONE DAY’S GOOD DEED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Spring's sun and bloom were at their best
When, leisured ease to seek,
Friend Scrybbler and myself found rest
Beside a babbling creek.
“How well,” I said as in our nook
We lounged, “might Kendall long
To steal the beauty of that brook
And put it in a song” !
The scented breeze about us blew,
The water murmured shy,
When Scrybbltr’s voice announced he, too,
Was going to have a try.
Thereat with many a frenzied whoop
He scrawled before my eyes
An ode to make the wattles droop
And Kendall’s ghost to rise.
'Twas full of rhymes like “trees” and
“breeze,”
Of “flowers and showers"—and worse
Those blithering inanities
That make the cultured curse.
At last, his lyric spasm done,
When angels might have wept,
The miscreant stretched him in the sun
And innocently slept.
The streamlet rippled as before,
Performing service free;
Discoursing music while it bore
Enwanted tilings to sea.
An impulse seized me. Right or wrong,
Stern duty’s course I took;
I stole the record of that song
And put it in a brook!

Tenor Joseph Hislop, who came to Sydney
with a large-sized reputation gained in opera
in three continents and Chicago, instantly
captured a big audience at the Town Hail
on Saturday night by an engaging person-
ality. Ilis first effort was Beethoven’s “Adel-
aide,” usually regarded as the supreme test of
lyric artistry, though there are no frills about
it. He displayed in it a voice of considerable
sweetness and charm, and sang the German
words caressingly—which isn’t the easiest
thing in the world for a Scotsman to do.
After that lie demonstrated a cosmopolitan
command of languages by singing in Italian,
French, Scandinavian and English—always
with feeling and perfect vocal control. In
the big tenor arias from “Tosca” and “La
Boherne” he reached the heights of dramatic
expression, and carried his audience with
him. His singing of “Che Gelida Manina”
was memorable. In Armstrong Gibbs's “Five
Eyes” he showed a gift for comedy and a
consideration for those earnest musical souls
who occupy the choir seats, turning round
and repeating the tasty little morsel so that
they could enjoy his grimaces. It was a big
programme, and encore numbers were neces-
sarily few, but one of them, “Recondita
Armonia,” from “Tosca,” was a notable
addition. Hislop has three recommendations.
He’s British and not ashamed of it; lie’s a
sound and well-trained musician; and lie’s
a clever showman. Also he apologised for
being five minutes late, which hasn’t hap-
pened very often in the Town Hall’s musical
history. His associates, Leila Doubleday, a
violinist with an ample command of tech-
nique and a good big tone, whom Melbourne
knew best in her student days, and Alberto
Sciarretti, a very capable and sincere accom-
panist, did their parts worthily. Sciarretti
showed his paces as a soloist in Chopin’s
G Minor Ballade and Valse in C sharp
minor, and played both with feeling and
good judgment. Miss Doubleday was at her
best in the “Spanish Dance” of Sarasate.
A crowded audience gave plentiful applause.
* * * *
The St. James (Sydney) lias found such
a good tenant in “Lady, Be Good” that there
is no likelihood of a change for a time ; and
Elsie Prince comes up brightly to each new
performance in spite of the exhausting doll
dance. She must break the hearts of her
understudies. “The Student Prince” gives
the Empire people no ground for complaint
cither, but its last weeks are announced.
"Ruddigore” has sung itself into favor at
Her Majesty’s; “The Ringer” at the Royal
seems likely to run for several weeks yet;
and the Grand Opera House is being kept
comfortably crowded by “Second-Hand
Brides.” Criterion and Palace are both
expecting new visitors. “Our Wife” is due
at the former on Saturday; in its original
form it was written by Sardou, and is full
of good dialogue and situations. The Palace
newcomer, “Outward Bound.” which will
introduce Zillali Bateman, will arrive a week
later; meantime the war picture “Ypres”
keeps the Palace busy.
Duncan Macdougall, at Sydney Playbox, did
his good deed on Sunday by giving a reading
of the works of Australian authors —a sort
of contribution to Australian Authors’ Week.
The idea was so good that one feels no
inclination to quarrel with the stereotyped
selection; and the interpretation was good
enough and sometimes better.
* * * *
Nightly, when Sydney Tivoli audiences
make their demand for “Stony Broke in No
Man’s Land,” George Carney asks with an
air of surprise, “Do you really want it?”
and nightly he gives it. The inimitable
Briants have brought back the hilarious
“The Dream of a Moving Man” ; and Sid
Beck, who has gone ahead remarkably
during the last two years, tells all about his
Egyptian Mum-Mum-Mummy to gusts of
laughter. The Fredo Brothers, who go on
playing violins whilst somersaulting, are the
newest arrivals; and Hetty King is in the
offing.
* * * *
The R.A.S.. intends to provide five days
and four nights of carnival at the Agricul-
tural Ground before its Royal Spring Fair
is over—it commences on September 27. It
is to be the biggest thing in carnivals this
Sydney generation has known, with every-
thing from band contests to woodchopping
on the programme.
Harold Lloyd, whose athletic capers and
horn-rimmed glasses have long displaced
Charlie Chaplin from his role of prince of film
fun-makers,. is as slick as ever in “The Kid
Brothers,” in spite of an inclination to pro-
long accidents until the last drop of fun is
wrung from them. The film is a rush of
laughter. “Fingerprints,” coupled with it on
Sydney. Lyceum bill, is a poor mixture of
unconvincing drama and overwrought farce.
The “Mr. Wu,” which lias made its appear-
ance. at Hoyt’s, comes aptly to disprove the
publicity declarations that English producers
can’t do the thing as well as the Americans.
In. spite of the good acting of Lon Chaney,
this screen version of the play does not com-
pare with the one produced a few years ago
in England with Matheson Lang as the lead.
“The Term of His Natural Life” is on its
last lap at the Crystal Palace, after proving
that Australian pictures do pay. At the
Prince of Wales “Ben Ilur” goes on, with
Albert Cazabon now wielding the sway over
the very fine orchestra which was relin-
quished on Friday night by Will Prior.
■i' '!•
There is little left to complain of now in
Stilly and Mo’s humor at Fullers’ (Sydney),
and the purified show goes so well that the
comedians ought to be encouraged to purge
their work of the few remaining smelly bits.
A Spain that is sometimes Mexico is the
venue of most of this week’s frivols, with
Amy Rochelle maintaining her old popu-
larity and Sadie Gale increasing liers. Yet
it is a pity that she should imitate tlie other
lady in throwing herself madly on to those
hard, loud notes which frequently recur in
her singing.
;J:
Variety in art
A search for variety in his choice of landscape
subjects marks the work of Ernest Buckmaster at
the Macquarie Galleries in Sydney. In
“Winter’s Grey Veil” he makes his theme the
romance of the mists through which nature
peeps almost spectrally, and he does it well;
but he turns from that to a sunny “Country
Group,” with its emphasis of deep shadow.
“Haze on the River,” with a suggestion of
fantasy, and the soft mellowing mist in
“Flinders-street, Melbourne,” attract particu-
larly ; but the artist is less successful in his
monotonous still-lifes; and the one portrait,
although well worked, is not inspiring.
The Melba Couservatorium’s dressing up
and singing of Beethoven’s only opera
“Fidelio” at the Melbourne Playhouse invites
somewhat prolonged reflections. Put into
modern terms, the tale goes this way. Flore-
stan, a Flinders-lane merchant, is flung into
Pentridge indefinitely for criticising the
Hogan budget. His wife, Leonora, disguises
herself as a man and obtains the position of
under-warder. The superintendent, Pizarro,
is peeved with Florestan, probably owing to
his habit of disturbing the other prisoners by
singing in his dungeon. He orders head-
gaoler Rocco to dispose of the disturber and
Rocco decides to strangle him where he lies
in his solitary damp confinement. He tells
Mrs. Leonora that she is at last to see her
husband, but only if she will do the grave-
digging. They proceed to shovel earth about
in close proximity to the slumbering Flore-
stan —he is a remarkably fine sleeper. Just
as the murder is about to happen, Mr. Fern-
ando, Minister of Prisons (without port-

coes death warrant (Arthur Stigant).
folio), phones np to say that he is coming to
inspect the institution, and Pizarro is
obliged to regretfully postpone the execution.
On arrival, Fernando expresses no surprise
at finding the prison yard full of convicts
and flappers from the neighboring district
all singing beautifully in chorus, but he is
terribly annoyed that his superintendent is
exceeding instructions. He promptly cashiers
Pizarro, commutes the rest of Florestan’s
sentence and, not to leave matters merely
half-and-half, releases all the other prisoners
without even consulting Mr. Hogan.
* * * s|s
It may be argued that the above descrip-
tion is too flippant. The writer’s defence
is that on the dramatic side the play
thoroughly deserves it. It has the silliest
libretto, the feeblest curtains and the most
ludicrous situations he has ever suffered.
Although the great Ludwig strove all his life
to write a musical show, thus sadly reducing
his output of symphonies and sonatas, it
is plain that he was no grand-operator.
His mind moved on a loftier plane. Who
but an artist unable to write down to his
public would have conceived the lugubrious
chorus of unshaven convicts? In compen-
sation, let it be said that the orchestral
scoring and the solos and duets are lordly,
at one time diabolically dark and the next
ringing clear with triumph—at all times
perfectly attuned to the supposed characters
of the. singers. Fritz Hart’s pupils handled
the piece as well as could be expected.
Claire Ward, as Marcellina, the gaoler’s
daughter, acted with spirit and sang with
pure, sweet sincerity. Howard Andrews,

dicky and a Gladstone collar, made Pizarro
behave as if someone was putting a penny
in him about once a minute. He looked as
if he was more in need of a good meal than
the principal prisoner, Stanley Allan. The
local demands of Leonora were too much
for Florence Stacli, whose faithful wifeli-
ness also was unconvincing. J. Howard
King was an excellent head gaoler in all
directions. The male chorus (despite its
need of a shave), and the female ditto (for
all its absurd intrusion) were vocally im-
pressive.
Armed with a fan as big as the piano,
Frances Alda has been entertaining small
audiences at Melbourne Auditorium, where
the rows are set so close together they might
have been designed for Mantell’s mannikins.
On Saturday she sang “Mi Chiamano Mimi”
(“Bohfeme”) delightfully. There was a
martial robustness about Rachmaninoff’s
soldiers’ song, and she also thanked God
for a Garden. (With the spring weeds
coming on, ordinary people would be more
inclined to be thankful for a gardener.) A
mildly interesting question is why vocalists
descend so much lower into banality than
instrumentalists. This commentator cannot
remember any distinguished pianist or fiddler
who plays anything so barrel-organy as
“Home, Sweet Home” by way of an encore.

Unlike his colleagues of the dailies who
can remember all the Hamlets since Better-
ton, the present Showman cheerfully owns to
having seen only an ’umble couple—a Malay
in Kuala Lumpur, F.M.S.. and Allan Wilkie.
Last Thursday at the Melbourne Royal he
added Peter Gawthorne to his collection.
Gawthorne is easily the best of the trinity.
He _ was restrained and impressive; his
diction was perfect—every word was under-
stood, instead of one in three, which is about
Wilkie’s highest average. His utterance was
beautifully rhythmic, yet cunningly natural-
istic. He was perhaps a trifle solemn, but
by no means pompous. There was no fire of
passion in him, but a good deal of intellectual
heat; and the deep interest of the house in
his troubles justified the interpretation. Until
Zillah Ophelia Bateman went off her pretty
head she was very - nearly maddening. After
that she was satisfactorily heartrending.
Eardley Turner ruled Denmark with distinc-
tion, but Queen Mildred Cottell has done
better in modern comedy. Edward Landor
rambled engagingly through Polonius, and
Ellis Irving showed a neat leg and much
sound Wilksperience as Laertes. Accompanied
by a resounding uproar of electric-light
switches Felix St. H. Jellicoe appeared and
vanished as the Ghost. The staging was
economical but effective.

The Australian Literary Society last week
repeated its year-old exploit at the Rail-
way Institute, staging in the one evening
four new Australian* plays, of which this
Typewriter witnessed 3L The first, “Mistress
Betty Treads a Measure,” by Isabel Handley,
was an innocuous but competent little
comedy of highwaymen and pretty ladies,
which reproduced the atmosphere of eight-
eenth-century England quite remarkably. In
the star role the authoress was excellent.
“Just Words,” by the indefatigable play-
wright who calls himself “Karta,” was "a
love affair in a Melbourne Park, fully
described by its title. Norman Ileymanson
wasted some fine acting on the hero. Mrs.
Vernon Williams’s contribution was “The
Vengeance,” a bellowdrama of the Vic. gold-
fields, but a sound, workmanlike bellow-
drama, all the same, with its murder in the
right place and some interesting psychology.
Furnley Maurice’s “The Pincher Pinched”

posing it had a jjoint. Writer left before

So far as first nights are concerned, a

on Saturday, though the Playhouse will foot
“The Golden Road,” a German film, de-
scribed as an idyll of man’s strength and
woman’s beauty with little clothing and no
cosmetics. To the O. and J. revels has been
added Edith Clifford. She is “the little

Melbourne Art:—
Fred Leist, born illustrator and great pictorialist,
is back from modelling real-estate paradises for
millionaire land boosters in Florida (where the
boom exploded lately), with a collection of large
and little canvases hanging at the Fine Arts. The
show is full of vigor, variety, imagination and
faulty painting. Nobody but a born illustrator
could have depicted the British tank descending on
the oblivious German machine-gunner in No. 1 with
such instinctive sense of the dramatic. Only a
pictorialist resigned to seeing liis work murdered by
modern mechanical methods of production would be
satisfied with the birthday suits of the ladies cavort-
ing by the pond in No. 8. In spite of all, however,
Leist steadily tends to rise above his journalistic
training. The background in No. 2, as absolute
painting, would be difficult to surpass ; “The Somme
in 1917” is a fine piece of realism; the woman
knitting in No. 53 is seen beneath the surface, and
the chateau in No. 56 show’s that the artist can
handle paint sincerely.
By respecting the canvases of Carl Hampel in
the New Gallery, a fire that broke out in Robertson
and Mullen’s last week showed good taste. Hampel’s
fresh efforts indicate improvement. Flowering
wattles, cows and other flora and fauna relieve the
monotony of his large, flat way of looking at things.
His skies are more vivacious and poetry creeps into
some of his foregrounds, though she is inclined to
apologise while she does it.

At the Adelaide Royal, “Rose Marie”
still draws crowded houses, Avhich seems to
mean that it will be the September Show
attraction. F. Bentley took a night off last
week to rest his throat, but is back as full
of vim as ever. The Totem Pole ballet girls
are invited to every subscription ball in the
town after the show is out, and largely add
to the sale of tickets. At the Prince of
Wales Muriel Starr and her clever company
have made Monday first-night quite a fashion-
able affair, and their weekly change of plays
is most acceptable. This week “Shooting
Shadows”—after the style of “The Ghost
Train” —was quite thrilling, though the
secret of the thrills is given away too soon.
Stud Foley’s Follies are still at the Majestic,
with a bright revue, “Spare Parts,” on the
second half of the bill. Phyllis Nicholson, a
clever little artist, is to the fore on this
programme. Beryl Mills is at West’s Pic-
tures, and at the Grand “Rocking Moon,”
the story of a girl who runs a blue-fox farm
in Alaska, is wonderfully interesting.
“The Listening-Insect”: A Morse short-
wave transmitting station at Braybrook
(Vie.) has been adapted to musical require-
ments, and the world is to be regaled from
time to time with Australian voices and
Australian airs broadcast powerfully enough
to reach the other side. American and Cold
Land stations have agreed to relay, so Aus-
tralian programmes may become the occa-
sional pabulum of listeners in those coun-
tries.

Unemployment Would
Decrease.
We have already proved
clearly that the loss to Aus-
tralian consumers due to the
difference in price of the “Old
Court” and the imported nob-
bier of whisky reached a total
of £1,875,000 in the past 12
months.
There is another aspect
equally important. It is the
industrial one.
The reader will readily real
ise what an army of workers
would be required in the case
of importation ceasing, to
operate this and subsidiary in-
dustries, and what Australia
most desires and needs is more
and more comfortable and
constant employment for its
people.
Since, in the case in question,
no sacrifice is demanded—
why not? Old Court Whisk;/
offers the opportunity—as well
as the saving of money due to
its lower price. It offers better
quality than the imported line.
Its purity stands unchallenged.
Experts acknowledge its matu-
rity and fine flavor. No brand
imported is its superior in ANY
way
You’ll find that the pre-
judiced view so often inspired
completely unfounded.

You Probably Have been “Had”
Men came to you selling shares. Or insurance. Or bonds.
They told you a good tale. They were plausible. You bought and to-day you are sorry. Or you ought to be sorry, but don’t
know it yet.
You not only may lose all you have put in, but you may be compelled to pay up a great deal more.
If you had spent 22/6 a year on “THE ‘WILD CAT’ MONTHLY” you would have known something about these matters, and
probably would not have lost your money. (And a good many people have lost their money without knowing it even now.)
Nobody who ever buys or sells a share, or who has an insurance policy, life or fire or accident, can afford to do without “THE
‘WILD CAT’ MONTHLY.”
During the past seven years hundreds of new companies have been formed in Australia. Many of them are very insecure. In a bad
time many of them will collapse. It is best to know their strength or their weakness beforehand.
You may be able to get out in time. And there are good things which you may be able to get into.
“THE ‘WILD CAT’ MONTHLY” is published from “THE BULLETIN” Office on the first Saturday of each month. Single copy, 2/-
Poverty
Point
Caul Boy”: Two examples of our favorite
form of artistic snobbery are evident in Mel-
bourne at the moment. Alda is being men-
tioned as “of the Metropolitan Opera House,
New York,” when she might as justly be
described as of J.C.W., Ltd., Melbourne. The
other specimen is Ivaai’s “Ilawaiians”—they
are largely Maoris. I fancy our entrepre-
neurs make a mistake nowadays in neglecting
the steady growth of local sentiment. Percy
Grainger’s Middle Brighton (Vic.) origin
was not concealed, and his season was a
triumph.
“Senex”: Harrie Ireland, so long associ-
ated with Bland Holt productions, generally
as the Titian-haired adventuress, has joined
the Final Company. For a dozen years
she had been an invalid. Harrie was a front-
rank actress of her day. Although it is in
the Bland Holt thrillers that she is best re-
membered, she also played with Kyrle Bellew
and Mrs. Brown Potter, and supported Julius
Ivniglit. Bland and liis wife are still cheer-
ful, but nearly all their players have passed
on. Harrie was the daughter of George
Richard Ireland, a mummer who did much to
the making of theatrical history in Aus-
tralia.
“Hamfat”: The Firm has “The Cuckoo
in the Nest” on its list. Ben Travers’s
book is humorous in patches, but the story
should improve in every way by transference
into play form. Travers has not succeeded
with “Thark,” produce*] at the London Ald-
wych—the theatre that was Australian
Y.M.C.A. headquarters during the war. Mary
Brough was one of the successes of the play,
which is described as one of “conventional
humor.” Mary, now 64 years old —she admits
it—remains one of the brightest comedy
women on the English stage.
_“L. de R.” : Melba has given a name to a
dish beloved of the flapper. She now seems
to be trying to provide Australian audiences
with a new way of applauding. Her loud
“ bravas ” have been a prominent feature of
recent concerts in Melbourne and the habit
has evidently caught on. At any rate a little
man broke out in the Continental fashion
after a very solemn symphony performance
the other night. Only the great can imitate
the great, however. “Fancy them letting an
intoxicated person in!” was the indignant
comment of the stout woman in the row in
front of me.
“The Stage Cat”: Two more Australian
actors have left for America. Claude Saun-
ders, last seen here in “Is Zat So?” and
“Six-cylinder Love,” and Raymond Law-
rence, who was playing in “The Ringer” up
to the eve of his departure. News of how
they fare will be anxiously awaited by a
circle of 10 local lads who plan to get from
the country before they are crowded out by
importations. If their arrangements come to
anything they will have left Australia within
the next 18 months.
“Alwyn”: Apropos of W. 11. Whiddon’s
association with the Petersham Choral
Society (B. 25/8/’27), the master of the
N.S.W. tax-hounds was offered the rble of
Blueskin in Maggie Moore’s production of
“.Tack Sheppard” before he entered the Gov-
ernment service. About the same time Harry
Rickards wanted him as a monologue enter-
tainer. Some years later Whiddon became
conductor of the Metropolitan Liedertafel,
and when Leon Caron died he was invited
to become J.C.W.’s musical director. But
prospects were bright in the service for him
at the time, and he stayed on—to provide
many a cartoonist and par-writer with
material for sketch or, joke.
“Craiser”: Dulcie Bland will step on to
the professional boards when “The Last
Warning” is delivered at Melbourne
Athenaeum. The clever lady will be grate-
fully remembered as making hot nights and
Ibsenism bearable for intellectual audiences
at the Queen’s Hall opposite. Beresford
Fowler’s dramatic school has provided her
with some valuable experience. On one occa-
sion she had to serve whisky to two topers
whose business it was to make a braw Scots
nicht o’ it. The coffee-essence that was to do
duty for the spirit had been forgotten, so
she brought on two jugs of water, and after
measuring out three fingers from the one
diluted it from the other. Then before the
audience had time to laugh she said “I
coudna find the wliusky, so I brocht the gin.”
“De Oriel”: McEwan the hypnotist, who
had a losing argument with a lorry, is just
out of Goulburn (N.S.W.) hospital. He
has lost every finger-tip on the right hand,
and has had to learn to do all his tricks left-
handed. Only the magician will understand
what that means.
“Cornstalk”: Dick Sliortland, now stage-
director of the Gilbert and Sullivan co.,
worked at his uncle’s carrying business and
played as a Sydney amateur. He first
appeared with Margaret Anglin as the
tailor in “The Taming of the Shrew.” Dick
one day asked his uncle’s vet. why dogs were
more genuine in their affection than most
human beings. “Because bad dogs are
drowned and mad dogs are shot,” was the
vet.’s reply. “And it’s a pity they wouldn’t
do the same with actors.”
MORE TO FOLLOW.
THE WITCH (he’s just stolen a kiss): “George! I’m surprised at you. You should
know better.”
THE SHEIK : “I do. But it’s a bit public here.”
“Cauboy”: The cleverest individual
achievement in “Mme. Pomp.” may be
credited to Vera Spaull, who handmaids
the leading lady. She started her career
as a child actress; Harrington Reynolds
took her round with that band of juveniles
ingeniously billed as “The Seven Little Aus-
tralians.” Reynolds’s end, by the way, was
of the kind which all true mummers are sup-
posed to covet. He had just finished a per-
formance as a stage priest in a provincial
theatre in M.L. when a heart seizure made
the offices of a real churchman necessary.
He died in the wings while the audience was
still filing out in front.
“Kismet” : .Consider the luck of the under-
study. Eddie Nable, an old Pollard Opera
boy, lias been understudy for the little
comedian playing Hard-boiled Herman in
“Rose Marie” ever since that marathon
show’ began in Australia. At each perform-
ance Eddie has turned up, a dressing-room
has been ready for him with his hard-boiled
clothes laid out, but never has he had a
chance to show what he could do. Once in
Sydney when his principal had a relaxed
throat Eddie got as far as dressing for the
part, but the imported man succeeded in
gasping through. Then for the one night’s
show in Ballarat Eddie got liis opportunity.
The regular Herman was too ill to appear,
and—Eddie sprained an ankle. A young
man of the chorus stepped into the breach.
“Macess”: Melbourne Akgus has it that
“in Hollywood a group of studios is en-
gaged in producing pictures with the rapidity
of a sausage machine.”
On sausage or on masterpiece begun,
The output is one swift, unending flow;
The two machines, you see, so smoothly run
On modern and efficient lines, although
The product to the best of my belief
In each case is of somewhat differing type;
Where one will mince and parcel pork or
beef
The other deals exclusively with tripe.
“F.S.”: Another product of Yic.’s movie
quota, Victoria Film Productions, is finding
its screen legs. Its first spasm, “The Shat-
tered Illusion,” with the fine scenery of
Westernport and Flinders as a background,
will be ready shortly. J. Robertson Aiken
is the chief illusionist.
“Sacred Lamp”: American papers have
been making a fuss because a flapper of
70 springs has won a New York competition
for the prettiest legs. There is nothing
strange in the lady’s triumph to those of
us old enough to remember when leg-shows
concentrated on legs instead of on the Alto-
gether, as they do now. The chorus of that
day was paraded in three rows. In the
front were the matrons and those whose
seniority entitled them to the rank, brevet or
otherwise. The second line was held by the
grandmothers, and an old guard of great-
grandmammas was in reserve. In the stalls
the procedure was reversed. The g.-g.-pas
in the orchestra stalls eyed the front
row-; the second generation was intent on
the middle row, and at the rear sat eager
youth fascinated with the back row’s beauti-
fully-modelled tights. It is pleasant to hear
of the old traditions being upheld, especially
in New York.
“Arradni”: “Utopia, Ltd.,” whose satire
“Jack Point” (B. 25/8/’27) suggests would
be enjoyed by Australians, was produced at
Adelaide Royal in 1908 or thereabouts, by
the Firm’s Royal Comic Opera Co. Included
in the cast were Mai-garet Thomas, Clara
Clifton, Claude Bantock, and (if my memory
serves me aright) George Lauri.
“M.G.S.”: A feature of Joseph Cunning-
ham’s staging of “Hamlet” at Melbourne
Royal was the inclusion of the military
proceedings after the collapse of Prince Peter
Gawthorne on his pyramid of corpses. Most
Shakspeareans regard this as a vile anti-
climax. As Cunningham produced it, no-
thing could have been more reasonable. The
emotions of the audience had been stretched
nearly to breaking-point by a continuous
orgy of Danish suicide and murder. The
loading of Gawthorne’s plentiful remains on
to a bier, and their gradual removal to the
dressing-room to the tune of the Dead March
from Beethoven’s E flat symphony, slowly
released the tension. Then tlie faint honk
of motor-horns and the newsboys announcing
the latest local suicides and murders restored
the house to normal.
“Philm Up”: Australia’s old footlights
acquaintance Henry Kolker has been asso-
ciated of late years in his native America
with the pictures as a producer and director,
but he has recently gone back to the acting
job. Saw him the other night supporting
Rebe Daniels in a farce, “A Kiss in a Taxi.”
The veteran has developed into a light
comedian of the “gay old dog type.” His
work all through was good, though his make-
up wasn’t.
“Hamfat”: S. W. G. Dawson, a master
at Scots’ College, Sydney, makes a taste
for movie-manufacture a useful hobby. In his
vacations lie turns out travel pictures for
Australian Films. “The Blue Mountains,” a
scenic film on tour with “The Term of His
Natural Life,” was taken by Dawson. His
“Haggis” is a picture of life at Scots’ Col-
lege, and the appreciative shouts of the
scholars nearly wrecked the roof when the
thing was shown in the school hall.
“Larrapinta” : Are there flies in America?
I have never seen actors in a Yankee film
chasing flies off their faces—even in open-
air scenes on obviously hot days, when there
should be millions of them buzzing about.
I have noticed Australian film-actors fly-
chasing, but the Yanks apparently keep the
pests at bay until the day’s “shooting” is
over.
“Goldilocks”: Cecil Haines, who did excel-
lently with Guy Bates Post in “The Mas-
querader,” has a part in “The Terror”
(another play by Edgar Wallace, who wrote
“The Ringer”), which opened in Southamp-
ton over a month ago and may go to London.
Pip Coghlan, who had to be content with
a show at Manly while in his own country,
has been doing leads in “The Ghost Train,”
“The Dover Road,” “Hay Fever” and “Peg
o’ My Heart” in America. When they come
back to Australia, they will probably secure
without difficulty the stage space for which
they had to fight before they went away.
“Hamfat”: It was at the Whitechapel
Pavilion Theatre that Maurice Moscoviteh
was discovered by the English. Right in
the Jewish quarter, this playhouse has been
devoted to Yiddish plays during recent years,
but it is to be turned into a picture-“palace.”
It is a house with a history, which began
in 1828; in 1856 the Royal Pavilion, as it
was called then, had a fire. The building
that rose from the ruins came to be known
as “The Drury-lane of the East.” The
proprietor, who sees more money in pitchers,
does not intend to drop Yiddish drama. He
aims at transferring it to a West End
theatre.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Isabel Handley is to get
a wider audience. Melbourne amateurs
staged her play, “The Mandarin’s Coat,” at
the Playhouse. Guy Bates Post intends to
produce it in America after he finishes his
London season in “The Climax.”
“Anaf”: The most curious side-line I
know was that of an actor who by
night played the hero in melodrama and by
day managed a glue factory. He became finan-
cially interested in a boiling-down works, and.
when this concern slumped, he and some
others took it over. With the aid of a fore-
man, who supplied the technical skill, they
succeeded in getting the business on firm
ground, and between performances as juvenile
lead the actor-r wielded a stirring stick in
the glue foundry.
“Wanchai”: What was Irene Vanbrugh's
first big part? In a 1919 edition of “The
Importance of Being Earnest” it is recorded
that she played Gwendolen Fairfax when
that bright comedy of Oscar Wilde’s was
produced at St. James Theatre (Lond.) in
February, 1895. Associated with her then
were George Alexander (as John Worthing,
J.P.) and Allen Aynesworth.
“Hamfat”: The craze for modeimising
plays has reached Berlin, where a company
has Americanised “The Mikado,” always popu-
lar with Fritz. The Mikado is a Yankee
sugar king, who wants a Nankipoo, clothed
in the excess of the young American, to
marry a fruit-king’s daughter. Amongst the
chorus a gang of American sailors help the
liveliness engendered by jazzed music and the
introduction of the Charleston.
“Arradni”: Apart from “Turandot” (B.
l/9/’27), the list of operas'to be performed
here next year is not arresting. It was
hoped that “Parsifal” w T ould have been
staged, for copyright restrictions are now
removed, and it has been sung in practically
every opera-house of note in Europe and the
Amei’icas. Further, ,T. C. Williamson once
presented a dramatic version, with Tittell
Bruno as Kundy, from the pen of Hillhouse
Tayloi’, and these effects have doubtless been
preserved. Strauss’s “Der Rosenkavalier,”
promised in earlier cables, has also been
shelved.
“C.Q.” : The site of the old Cyclorama in
Victoria-parade, Fitzroy, seems doomed to
stage warfare in one way or anothei*. For
years the multitude paid its sixpence to
gape at the Battle of Waterloo, and when
that excitement wore out wrestling and
stoushing contests raged within its walls.
The next act is to be the battle with disease.
The octagonal eyesore is to be demolished
and a wing of St. Vincent’s Hospital
erected in its place.
THAT NIGHT!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When I am at the picture show
I want a film that’s full of go;
I like it served up hot.
I do not mind artistic stuff
But I prefer my pictures rough ;
I love a quick-fire plot.
Give me a wild and stirring fight—
I feel my preference is right,
And so do other men;
But I am thrilled when on the screen
Those mystic words are clearly seen—-
The caption curt, “And Then—
I know that things will happen quick;
I know the boy and girl will click;
And I am happy quite.
Excitedly I grip my seat
When there appears upon the sheet
Those pregnant words—“ That Night!”

Taking Up a Homestead.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOU’LL be single when th’ idea o’ takin’
up a homestead’ll first get you. You'll
be sober an’ steady goin’, too, because
you can’t afford to sow much wild oats. But
you'll be sick an’ fed-up o’ knockin’ round,
workin’ for wages which you won’t ahvays
get. ’N’ you’ll be longin’ to settle down an’
have a place o’ your own with a stake in tli’
country, an’ to be your own boss an’ have
a little Avife an’ nice kids. Callin’ of even-
in’s at coves’ places, an’ seein’ the way their
wives wait on them, findin’ dry things for
them to put on an’ rubbin’ their chests to
doctor their colds, an’ givin’ them clean
tow’ls an’ combs an’ hair brushes to do
themsel\ r es up with ’fore tea, an’ tyin’ rags
on their fingers, an’ poulticin’ their hands
to draw splinters out, an’ hearin’ them
singin’ to th’ baby an’ ticklin’ it to death
to make it laugh—these things’ll make you
feel an outcast, a parasite an’ a cold foot,
till y° u won ’t be nearly so easy in your
in ind as you’ll let on to be.
you’ll decide one night when you’re gone
to bed feelin' lonely to take th’ first step,
anyway, an’ chance th’ ducks. An’ Avlien you
tell your friends — there won’t be a multitude
o’ them to tell — they'll be kind o’ ’mused
at first to hear you're going in for a home-
stead, au’ll figure you'll be contemplatin’
matrimony—gettin’ th’ cage ready to put tii’
bird in. They’ll be old homesteaders, o’
course, an’ some of their wives who’ll be
gran’mothers’ll stir yoor pride an’ vanity
when approvin’ o’ your intention by tellin’
you that you’re real Solomon-wise for not
doin’ what some they knew did, an’ they'll
screw unforgivin’ faces at their old men
squattin’ at th’ fire gazin’ into tlr flame as
if waitin’ for a shower o’ money to come
flyin’ out of it. “Caught their birds before
they had th’ cage to put them in,” they’ll
tell you, with th’ consequence that they had
to hawk them round th’ country wherever
they Avent lookin’ for work, and puttin’ them
into cages provided by others more enter-
prisin’, and gettin’ ’em out again after pay-
in’ rent, like city stiffs redeemin’ their
clothes! “Gripes, no!” you’ll grin to them,
“they’ll be nothin’ like that about me.” An’
those old girls’ll be workin’ all th’ time
they’re talkin’ to you, slashin’ into a basin
o’ cream with a spoon, an’ lickin' some that
breaks into butter off th’ back o’ their hands,
an’ they’ll end by sayin’: “Well, see you
stick to it an’ don’t let anyone change your
mind.”
By-’n’-bye, you'll begin to save some o’
your wagek to take up th’ homestead with,
an’ make a bit of a start. Old Silas King,
a boss farmer in th’ district who’ll have
scraped a lot o’ land together in legal and
other ways durin’ his sixty-odd year as a
colonist, an' is a J.P. an’ on th’ church com-
mittee, will have been advisin’ you more than
once when you’ve been workin’ for him put-
tin’ up a fence, an’ lie’s been prowlin’ round
Avatchin’ if you chopped th’ ends off th’ posts
instead o’ dippin’ them three feet into th’
ground, to take a homestead an’ be a man,
an’ get a wife to help y’ to do somethin’ in
the world. “Pshaw!” he’ll scoff, “a strong
an’ active an’ healthy young man like you,
Dickie Gall, afraid to tackle a homestead for
yourself! Tut! tut!” Then lie'll urge you
to go an’ get th’ land. “Get hold of a block,
no matter how T small, Avhether you have tli’
money or not—get it before it is all gone,
an’ think about how you’re goin’ to pay for
it afterwards. Look at me; when I selected
my first block I hadn’t a sixpence left to
Avork it with; the Lands Office took it all.
But I stuck it out, an’ by trustin’ to God
an’ attendin’ to my church I’ve come through
with it; an’ look at me now, please God.”
So in a year or two you’ll hear of a block
o’ good land bein’ thrown open for home-
stead selection, an’ you’ll find out all about
it from th’ storekeeper, or someone who reads
tli’ newspaper. You’ll be told to keep it
very quiet, an’ not let on to anyone that
yoivre goin’ in for it, an’ then you'll _ Avith-
draw your savin's from tli’ bank an’ into
the Lands Office it’ll go with your applica-
tion. There'll be anxious moments for ,v’
for a while, an’ for a lot of others as well.
Though you’ll be broadminded an’ hope it'll
be someone wantin’ land worse than yourself
that’ll get th' block you’re in for if you
don’t, you’ll be wishin’ all th’ same that his
application’ll be informal, or get lost, an’ all
the others’ applications as well.
For some reason your luck’ll be in. Th’
little savin’s you punted with’ll be cast on
tli' water,.. an'll come back in a Government
letter tollin’ you you’ve become holder of
homestead block No. 0000, situate in th
Parish o’ Maloney, County Joe, containin’
100 acres, more or less.
Laws, how your hand’ll shake when you’re
readin’ it, as if you were afraid it was a
summons! But when you finsh tli’ last
word you’ll put on a smile an’ poke your
chest out, an’ feel a lot taller. ’N’ when th
first Sund’y comes you’ll be on to a horse
an’ off out to haAP a good look at your new
homestead. You’ll already have had about
twenty looks at it, but it Avasn’t yours then,
an’ you hardly dreamed that it ever would
be.
Arrivin’ there you'll start ridin’ all over
it, with th’ proud feelin’ of ownership.
Every inch of it’ll be yours —th’ timber
standin’ on it; th’ logs an’ firewood lyin'
about; heaps o’ fencin’-posts that some coves
split an’ never took away; what’s left of
an old sheepyard an’ shepherd’s hut erected
by th’ squatters before you were born :
th’ grass an’ th’ wild floAvers; even tli
darn stones’ll be yours ! Gripes, how you'll
stand an’ admire it!
An’ while your horse’ll be snatchin’ at
tli’ grass, as if he, too, knew it was. yours
an’ wanted to sample it to give opinion on
th’ quality, you’ll sit there in th’ saddle
gazin’ at your property an’ tryin’ to reduce
it all to £ s. d. There’ll be a couple o’ hills
that'll take your fancy as ideal spots for
a bouse an’ yards, but you won’t knoAv
which to decide on. Standin’ on either o’
them you’ll see Tipsy Peak five miles away
to th’ east; an’ Burton’s patch o’ greenstuff
an’ tli’ iron on Bellingham’s house shinin’
at th’ foot o’ Mount Sibly tli’ same number
o’ miles away to th’ west. It’ll be a won-
derful sight, an’ that homestead’ll seem like
nothin’ but a big Christmas-tree bangin’
with prizes. An’ then you’ll start Avonderin’
what would be a good name to call it. Being
a real Australian —no city brummyjim—
you'll think o’ Wonggonggera an’ Turmur-
rumi an’ Yalcalbah an’ a lot of other, abo.
names; an’ perhaps you’ll be in a jokin'
mood an’ think o’ callin’ it Saint Elmo
Square, Th’ Boolevarde or Labor Mayor’s
Parade, an’ bein’ hvay out there by yourself
in that lonesome, unoccupied area you 11
laugh loud at th’ ridiculousness o’ th’ last
lot. an’ you’ll ride on a bit further.
You’ll strike up along Red Rock Gully
to see how much water you've got in th’
spring. . It’ll be because o’ th’ water on it
that you an’ everyone else applied for that
particular block. An’ that spring 11 be th
only water for miles around-that was never
known to go dry in a drought. At least,
that’ll be what you’ll have heard from all
th’ oldest inhabitants who used to camp
near it th’ time they Avere kangaroo : shootin .
an’ payment for scalps first came in. Fol-
lerin’ a beaten track you’ll switch-back th'
sides o’ th’ gully for a quarter of a mile
till you come to a small flat in a deep hollow
o' th’ range. Tli’ flat'll be bare as bark
an’ sprinkled over Avith cowdung in season
an’ out o’ season, an’ with bones an’ horns.
Th’ hollow’ll be a campin’-ground for th'
beasts that come to water there. An’ lioav
your eyes’ll sparkle an’ your heart beat

r
' 'lion you see th’ water shinin’ under a
high claywall, an’ little waves not bigger
than a gum-leaf ripplin’ to th’ wind. It’ll
be an inspirin’ spectacle. You’ll nearly run
over a couple o’ old cows in your hurry
to get near th’ spring to look down into
th’ depths of it. An’ th’ longer you’ll be
lookin’ down into it tli’ deeper it’ll seem
to be. Tli’ deepest part, though, won’t be
more than a couple o’ feet —accordin’ to th’
amount o’ mud an’ bones that’ll be in it.
Hut it’ll be twelve feet wide an’ more, per-
haps, an’ th’ water’ll be pretty clear if th’
cattle haven’t just been puddlin’ in it.
Though there’ll sure to be some yellow old
bones protrudin’ round th’ edges, you won’t
see them; you’ll only see gold in it. An’
after a while, perhaps, you'll be interested
to see your horse an’ yourself reflectin’ m
it.
Th homestead’ll grow on you, an’ you’ll
look doVn along tli’ gully an’ up at th’
rock sides feelin’ like Captain Cook when
he found Botany Bay. There’ll be green
grass three feet long, but it’ll be hangiu’
down drapin’ th’ cliff, an’ th’ bones lyin’
underneath on th’ rock bottom’ll be evidence
o’ what become o’ cattle' that was tempted
to reach down for it. An’ th’ bees coinin’
to th’ water and flyin’ off at every angle’ll
tell you there’s lots o’ honey on th’ home-
stead which’ll mean extra revenue for income-
tax. So you’ll decide to stop coves from
choppin’ down trees for bees’-nests, an’ you'll
mean to write out a public notice to put
up soon as you get home. There’ll be gum-
trees an’ wattles hangin’ over that spring,
too, an’, they’ll be in blossom. Th’ smell
o’ them’ll take away your breath. An’ th’
number o’ silvery-throated birds hoppin’
about th’ limbs an’ on tli’ rocks greetin’
you as if they had word you was cornin’
to reign over them’ll be more than you can
count, an’ll make you feel a lord, an’ that
you created tli’ homestead yourself an’ all
things livin’ on it.
But while you’re standin’ there contem-
platin’, your horse’ll be fidgetin’ for a drink.
He ain’t concerned like you about th’ birds
an' th’ bees an’ th’ fortune you’ve got; so
you’ll hop off an’, givin’ him tli’ reins, will
let him help himself. An’ while he’s incliin’
cautiously into it, stretchin’ his neck an’
snortin’ at th’ bees to blow them out o’
readh o’ his nose, you'll take your hat off
an’ get down to it full length on th’ flat
o’ your stomach yourself. Lovely an’ cool
it’ll, be., too, an’ in th’ middle o’ your thirst
you’ll lift your head an’ gasp for breath;
an’ then smack your lips as if it was a
brewery you'd come into. You’ll give a
glance to see how th’ horse is enjoyin’ it.
An . lie'll be takin’ it in like a pumpin’-
station. His ears’ll be workin’ like handles;
his eyes'll be on th’ bees ; an’ you’ll see th’
water hurlin’ along his neck as if he had
an elevator in him. You’ll grin at th’ hurry
lie’s in, an’ then start into it again yourself.
An’ while you’ll be suckin’ it up there’ll
be a string o’ quiet cattle saunterin’ along
a track that skims tli’ edge o’ th’ clay
cliff ’way up above, a hundred feet an’
more. An’, as cattle’ll often do, they’ll be
shovin’ one another at th’ most dangerous
angles, till one of ’em’U slip a cloven hoof
oyer th' edge an' disturb a hundredweight
o' loose cliff that's been on th' balance since
th’ last rain. It’ll leap out an’ come down
without touchin’ anythin’ except air till it
reaches the water right where you an’ your
horse is drinkin’, an’ between your two
heads. Lord! There'll be such a brain-
dazin'. wallopin’ splash that for th’ time
you won’t know if th’ spring has erupted
or someone hidin’ about is playin’ a joke on
you. Rut when you find your feet, an’ wipe
th’ mud out o’ your eyes an’ th' water
out o' your hair an’ look around, there'll be
not a livin’ soul about; but your horse’ll
be turnin’ about eighty yards off, boldin’ his
head high, his tail goin’ up in line, th’
bridle-reins bangin' before him, an' he all
splashed an’ lookin' surprised an’ scared an'
’dignant, an’ the old cows that were lyin'
about when you came up, as if they had
finished up with this world an' was waitin’
for a pass for th’ next, 'll be all on their
feet starin’ at you as if you were an evil
spirit, an’ all of 'em ready to stampede
down th’ gully. An' all th’ silvery-throated
birds'll scent somethin’ an’ there won’t
be a flutter or a whimper come from one
o' them. An', 'way up above, th’ cattle
who made th’ t.rouble’ll be sliowin’ only
their horned heads an’ lookin’ down in a
line at you like soldiers from over th’ walls
of a fort. Even a dog-garn black goanna
scootin' round a tree-butt’ll keep his beady
eye on you till he gets up high enough to
feel safe. _ Every livin’ thing round that
spring, an’ above it, an’ below it, in fact,
’ll regard you as a disturbin’ element. But
you won't be long solvin’ th’ mystery, for
when you'll look on tli’ water again, which’ll
have changed color, there’ll be a section o’
that hundredweight o’ loose cliff pokin’ out
over th' surface an’ a couple o’ dragon-flies'll
be holdin’ a meetin’ on it. Your brain'll
travel fast then an’ a shudder'll go down
your back an’ up it again ; an’ realisin’ your
solitude an’ how far from first-aid you are,
you 1] ask yourself what th’ devil you would
have done if that loose cliff had landed
on top o’ your head when you were drinkin’.
Then you’ll move off, sneakin’ quiet round
your horse, keepin’ wide out so as not to
startle him; an' th’ silly-brained, quizzin’
old cows’ll move off after you, makin’ sure
you’re a spook. An’ not till you're on th’
horse an’ lookin’ yourself again will they
believe it’s you. Rut when you’ll roar at
them loud enough to frighten a lot o’ lions
they’ll lower their heads an’ close their
eyes again; an’ th’ birds’ll all start chirpin’
as if it. had just come daylight. Then you’ll
round up all th’ cattle about, wavin’ your
hat. at. them ’stead of a whip, to see what
their brands an' ear-marks’ll be. Gee! they’ll
all belong to old Silas King, every hoof o’
them, an’ eatin’ all your grass an’ drinkin’
your water! He’ll have had th’ use o’ your
homestead without payin’ rent to anyone
for half a life-time! An’ his boundary-
fence, which’ll have an opening in it four
panels wide for tli’ cattle to go in an’ out,
’ll only be a few hundred yards off. “To
take some o’ his advice is all right.” you'll
reason to yourself, “but that don’t mean
you’re goin’ to let him have th’ use o’ your
property to run hi s stock on !” So you’ll
rush them away from th’ spring, shoutin’ at
them, an' hustlin’ them through th’ openin’
into his paddock. Then you’ll get down an’
hang your horse up while you mend up th’
fence, so as they won’t come through to
trespass again. An’ when you’ll be ridin’
off feelin’ you’ve done some good work those
cattle’ll be standin' not far away, watching
you, indignant lookin’; and you'll wish you
had a good dorg to put on to their heels
an’ send them to Halifax.
Crossing a ridge covered with broom-brush
an' pebbles an’ flint stones, an’ from where
you'll get a clear view of tli' sunlit plains
beyond, bronzewing pigeons an' quail’ll keep
flyin’ up, an' you’ll recollect Mrs. Fitzpatrick
always sayin’, an’ who’s pretty well off, that
country where there’s been plenty pigeons
is th’ best locality for raisin' turkeys; an’
all at once you'll see yourself growin' great
flamin’ gobblers by th' hundred, an' when
others’ll have none, an’ sendin’ them to
market at top price, as a sideline. And as
you move on over th’ ridge there’ll be so
many big goannas creepin’ about, pullin’
their long tails after them, that you'll figure
another couple o’ quid a week revenue out
o’ th’ oil that’s inside them. Leanin’ here
an' there, too, against trees'll be snares
set to catch 'possums. You’ll stop to stare
at them. An’ all the dog-garn cheek you
ever heard of in th’ bush’ll easily be capped
by this piece o’ ’frontery! Settin’ snares
on a bloke’s homestead to catch his ’pos-
sums with! You won’t stand for that, an’
so you’ll kick all those snares over, takin’
away some o’ tlr copper-wire to mend things
with. Ghost, before you’ve ridden all over
that homestead again it’ll be improved to
twelve quid an acre. An’ after viewin’ th’
two hills again an’ decidin’ which’U be th’
site for th’ house an’ yards you’ll imagine
you can see them all ready built. There’ll
be th’ house with a verandah all round,
painted chocolate; th’ barn an’ stable roofed
with iron an’ a windmill twirling an’ creak-
ing beside them, an’ a yard full o’ cows
walkin’ in an’ out o’ th’ bails, an’ a big
roan bull sliakin’ his head, expostulatin’ an’
lookin' indignant through th’ rails because
he’s not allowed in.
Th’ world’ll be movin’ rapid with you now,
for a minute or two—until you take another
look round an’ then turn your head for home.
Your home'll perhaps be at Caledonia, Old
Bob Sankey’s farm, where you’ve been
workin’ th’ last four or five years: an’ o’
course, as we said, th’ day'll be Sund’y—.
you wouldn’t be out away from Caledonia
lookin’ at your block if it wasn’t. As luck’ll
have it, you’ll catch up to old Silas King
when you get on to th’ main road. He’ll
be drivin’ himself home from church in a
sulky—he always has th’ sulky to himself
on _ Sund’y; his thoughts don’t get crowded
in it, an’ it gives him room for pious reflec-
tion an’ thanksgivin’. But he’ll have a
Bible an’ hymn-book beside him on th’ seat
to give him sti-ength an’ keep him company.
An’ as you come up with him, proud that you
know him to speak to an’ burstin’ to tell
him th’ good news, you’ll feel a sinner for
bein’ out breakin’ th’ Sabbath an’ neglectin’
th’ collection.
“Gettin’ back from church, Mr. King?”
you'll greet liim humbly across th' wheel
as you draw up close, an' springin’ in th’
saddle to it.
“Hello!” he’ll answer, surprised, an'
clutchiu' th’ reins tight, an’ sittin’ up for fear
tli’ horse'll jump with surprise, too. “Yes.
yes; an’ it’s where everyone should be gettin'
back from, isn’t it—who have thanks to
offer to God for His blessingsV”
Though you'll know that old Silas would
make a pretty low pass in a test in keepin'
th’ Commandments, ’specially on th’ covet-
ing-of-his-neiglibor’s-QX section, an’ that his
soul would be much cast down when th'
results would be known, you’ll be shy o'
startin’ an argument about religion. So
you’ll treat his rebuke in a spirit o' neutral-
ity, an’ lose no time tellin’ him how you
acted on his good, friendly advice, an’ applied
for a homestead block, an’ got one.
"You got a homestead—where?”
An’ he’ll turn his head quick, an’ look at
you, suspicious, forgettin’ almost that he's
drivin’ a horse. Not knowin’ that lie’s been
wantin’ that block 'o' land bad for years for
th' water that’s on it, an’ that he moved
members o’ Parliament, an’ Government offi-
cials, an’ Heaven an’ earth pretty well to
have it thrown open for selection as quiet
as possible, an’ put in a dozen dummy appli-
cations for it, you’ll tell him all about th’
block you got, an’ ask him his opinion about
it.
“What! Spring Gully!” He’ll frown at
you as if you wanted to gather some o’ th‘
riches he’s been heapin’ up. “That country
is not a bit o’ good for farmin’; ’twould
starve a dam’ bandicoot!”
You'll think lie's a curious old chap, an’
start puttin’ it down to liver or too much
devotion to religion.
Then he’ll look at you again, after giviu'
attention to th’ horse, an’ tell y’ that if
you re goin’ to hold it you’ll have to make a
lot of improvements on it, an’ pay him for
half his boundary-fence that he put up twenty
years ago, which cost him fifty pounds a
mile! You won't be able to speak much
after that —only think. An’ when leavin'
him at th’ cross-roads you'll hardly hear him
chucklin’ an’ tellin’ you you were a fool to
go in for it—a dam’ young fool!” For th’
rest o’ th’ road to Caledonia, you’ll feel that
he was a lion you met on th' way an' that
lie slew y', an’ is still standin’ over your
corpse.
Hut that night when you’ll be comfortable
in bed. an’ you put out th’ light, you’ll see
your new homestead gleamin’ out there under
th’ range, an’ th’ grass an.’ timber, an’ the
possums an’ goannas, an’ th’ silvery-throated
birds’ll seem to’ve increased ; an’ then you’ll
see it as it’ll be in ten years: a railway goin’
to it; a procession of plough-teams an’ wag-
gons movin’ abomt; dairy cows an’ their
calves goin’ from one paddock to another,
women carryin’ tea about an’ kickin’ up their
skirts, an’ tennis-balls flyin’ over th’ nets;
buyers o’ first-grade wheat cornin’ an’ goin’:
coves offerin’ you twenty quid an acre walk
in walk out; the banker callin’ an’ liftin'
his hat —an’ you’ll tell old Silas King he
can go to hell!
