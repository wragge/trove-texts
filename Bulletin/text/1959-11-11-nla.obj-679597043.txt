PROUD SAVAGES
The Kuma people in the Wahgi
Valley of New Guinea, so Dr. Marie
Reay tells us in The Kuma, published
by Melbourne University Press for the
Australian National University, con-
sider themselves —and rightly enough,
too —the peak of human civilisation.
The language they speak, called
“Yoowi,” means “real speech” as
opposed to “other,” just as the Greeks
described all speech other than their
own as “barbarous”; and the Kuma
people, and those with whom they are
able to converse, are “real” people as
opposed to the phantoms or barbarians
occupying all the rest of the earth.
It is true that, from our point of
view, these are naked and somewhat
unpleasant savages, given to lascivious
courting - ceremonies and strangely
obsessed with pigs; but we do not
always see ourselves clearly in these
matters, and from their own point of
view the claim is reasonable. The pig
simply represents to them the idea of
wealth or property; and, allowing for
the fact that we are usually obsessed
with other forms of wealth (say, sheep),
it cannot be said that here they differ
fundamentally from ourselves. If we
do not sit around openly and “carry
leg” in our courting ceremonies, per-
haps it is as well not to consider too
deeply what we do practise.
Upon the pig the Kuma have based
a sensible and workable economy; and
if in the elaborate and spectacular Pig
Ceremonial, which occurs at varying
intervals when they can afford it, they
run wild and eat all their pigs so that
it takes them about five or even ten
years before they can breed-up the herds
and have another feed of pork, this
does not differ very much from our
own familiar cycle of boom and slump.
The only really disconcerting thing
about the pigs is that the women take
them into their houses—where both live
apart from their husbands—but even
here Dr. Reay is able to assure us that
the pigs are “house-trained.” like a
well-behaved cat. The men, inci-
dentally, do not have much to do with
the pigs, except that they look after
the stud-boars.
The Kuma have a satisfactory set of
tribal and family relationships— who
is allowed to marry whom; what
degree of authority is proper to
brothers, aunts, mothers-in-law and so
on—which Dr. Reay duly explains in
that wonderful and totally incompre-
hensible jargon which anthropologists
have invented for themselves. They
have strict ideas on marriage, chiefly
that the young girls may be as promis-
cuous as they like before marriage but
never afterwards, while the men must
be polite and humble to the unmarried
girls but not to their wives.
This, though Dr. Reay seems to take
rather a feminist view of it, all seems
very sensible; and so does the final
rule that, though their wives must be
faithful, there is no such restriction
on the husbands. The women, it should
be added, are by no means down-
trodden. They rebel openly against
the men, they deride their religious
beliefs, and, in one specific case which
is mentioned, a wife who objected to
her husband’s taking a new spouse
from an enemy clan spent several days
after the newcomer’s arrival rushing
at her with a long pole shouting “Puai,
puai!”—not at all a nice thing to say:
it means “May you go!”—and eventu-
ally split her head open.
Religious matters, despite the secret
derision of the women, are happily
provided for by a belief in two prin-
cipal spirits or demigods, Geru, known
as the Guardian of the Pigs, and
Bolim, the Red Spirit, who, though also
interested in pigs, is thought to be
more concerned with human fertility.
Faced with the eternal problem of the
apparent duality of the divine nature,
the Kuma have resolved it by the belief
that neither of these two spirits is par-
ticularly benevolent —indeed they go
about wrecking herds and crops—but
both may be placated by suitable
offerings . . . naturally, of pork. It is
fortunate for the economy of the people
that these spirits, like the ghosts of
recently deceased relatives, who must
also be placated with pork, are satis-
fied to eat the ghosts of pigs while
the actual flesh is consumed by the
natives. The ultimate fate of a
deceased Kuma is that, when nobody
is left alive who knew him, he departs
to a remote mountain-top in the Kubor
Range, where “he curbs again his
fundamentally pig-like nature and
settles down to cultivate ghostly
gardens.”
Thus happy in their religion, their
economy and (despite Dr. Reay) their
marriage customs, the Kuma are at
least in one respect considerably more
civilised than ourselves, and that is in
the honor they pay to the Rhetoric
Thumper. These estimable indi-
viduals are a sort of combination of
orator, poet and statesman; and, pacing
and thumping the ground and decor-
ated with plumes of the bird-of-
paradise, they deliver advice and
exhortation to the tribe in measures of
stately verse which have—so we are
assured by Dr. Reay, who has herself
written poetry for “The Bulletin”—
the elements of both rhyme and
rhythm. It is as if Mr. Menzies and
Dr. Evatt were in the habit of making
their speeches in verse or, alternatively,
as if the nation were habitually
governed by its poets. However, it
must be said that it could be difficult
to be a poet, or Rhetoric Thumper,
among the Kuma, since anybody who
goes for a solitary walk —which most
poets require to consult with their
Muse—is instantly suspected of prac-
tising either witchcraft or adultery.
Finally one must add that the Kuma
have a very pleasant system of relief
by debauch—about once a year they
get drunk on mushrooms —and that,
like ourselves, their great problem in
these overcivilised times is how to
release themselves from the tensions of
existence without going to war. Beat-
ing one’s wife is not ultimately enough,
and even the resplendent promises of
the cargo-cult tend to be unsatisfactory
when the cargo fails to turn up.
Thus on the whole the Kuma is a
fellow human being whom it is a great
pleasure to meet and greet as a
brother; and this reviewer’s only regret
is that Dr. Reay’s book, excellent in its
kind, should have had to be presented
in the severe form of an academic
thesis, which must inevitably restrict
its public. Could she not now write
a personal, more popular account of
her experiences among these delightful
people?
Molnar's Cartoons
It is a peculiar fact that two of the
leading commentators (in black-and-
white art) on the Australian scene at
the moment are both of foreign origin;
and if Emile Merrier, who is of French
descent, and Molnar, who is Hun-
garian, have long established them-
selves as Australians, their question-
able choice of birthplaces does still
seem to have some relevance to their
art. In fact, the point needs to be
noted whenever the tradition of Aus-
tralian black-and-white art, mentioned
on the dustjacket of Molnar’s Insub-
stantial Pageant (Angus and Robert-
son) is considered; for from “Hop”

PROBLEMS OF THE
COMMONWEALTH
r T'HE public will hear very little of
the discussions of the Common-
wealth Parliamentary Conference now
sitting in Canberra.
At first view the conference seems
more calculated to divide peoples and
Governments than to unite them into
a Commonwealth whole, though all
seem dedicated to the ideal of unity.
The majority of the gathering have
been blessed with an English educa-
tion, a large proportion in the Inns of
Court, and, with it. accents which
might do more than credit to an Oxford
don.
This produces an illusion that they
are much more in unison in their ideals
and ideas than they actually are.
The illusion is heightened by the
fact that they all drink the same
beverages and approach in a uniform
spirit the diets of smoked oysters and
gherkins-on-biscuit which are the
main nourishment at Australian
cocktail-parties.
A VERY little contact, however,
soon destroys the illusion of
political homogeneity. The promotion
of many States to self-government and
of rebels to Parliamentary status has
only served to mask antipathies and
prejudices. And though all indubitably
speak English, they speak it with
reserves upon the meaning of words
and implications which are often
exclusively the speaker’s own.
It is perhaps as well, therefore, that
the conference closed its doors after
the preliminary platitudes and reviews.
The natural urge to use the meeting
for the pushing of barrows full of self-
interest was evident in Harold Holt’s
opening address and in the subsequent
debate.
Mr. Holt was naturally concerned
with the maintenance of a range of
world prices which would hold up
Australia’s economy, and most Aus-
tralians will say “good luck” to his
viewpoint. But there were a good
many delegates present from backward
countries, with newly achieved inde-
pendence and populations living at or
below breadline standard, who
cherish the objective of getting prices
so low that they can afford to feed their
peoples regularly through imports,
where they cannot produce locally.
Mr. Holt is earnestly in favor of
combination of Commonwealth coun-
tries within GATT to promote “fair
trade practices” and to ensure that
“regional or bilateral arrangements do
not prejudice the trading-interests of
other countries.”
But this seems in present circum-
stances to be something of a dream.
Events during the week, for instance,
showed how little chance GATT has
of persuading the United States to
abandon a rigid policy of import-
restriction, and the experience of
Europe has demonstrated that there are
boundaries to international benevolence
as well as to countries.
XJrOLT complained that though Aus-
tralia favored the creation of a
European community with the widest
possible basis of membership, the
application of this idea, which had
been preached generally by Western
European economists and politicians,
had been whittled-down to limit the
practical realisation of the plan to six
countries tightly packed round the
coal and communications centre of the
European continent France. Ger-
many. Italy. Netherlands. Belgium and
Luxembourg. The rest were left out
in the cold.
This had compelled the U.K. to
establish a second community of
scattered nations, all small except
Britain, to form the European Free
Trade Association, of which the
interests in many respects were
diametrically opposed to those of the
other bloc, parts of which are also
opposed in some degree to the interests
of primary producers the world over.
Both European groups will be more
effectively able to protect themselves
in the world markets against rises or
maintenance of prices of raw materials
on which their manufacturing
economies depend and against dump-
ing by the United States of cheap coal
in Europe to the detriment of employ-
ment on the Belgian and German coal-
fields and of grains which the U.S.
holds in huge surpluses.
The same conditions which exist in
Europe exist also as between Com-
monwealth countries and tend to
divide the Asian and African groups
of “have-nots” from the North
American and Australasian “haves.”
As the Canadian delegate, Mr.
Harold Winch, declared in the discus-
sion on Mr. Holt’s thesis, “without
planned production leading to co-
operation, there could be no talk of
unity within the family.” He said that
“greater co-operation is the only
answer”; and that is very difficult in
so diverse an overall agglomeration of
nations as is now represented by the
groups which form the Common-
wealth, some of whom have interests
which seem—economically —violently
opposed to those of others.
Most of the Asian countries with
experience of its work seem to be
grateful for the Colombo Plan, though
its impact in obtaining the ultimate
objective of self-sufficiency in food and
consumer-goods in general is relatively
small.
It is very difficult to reconcile the
conflict of interests between nations in
which the average man feels he is living
in poverty if he doesn’t at least partly
own his own home, motor-car and TV-
set and those in which the majority
yearn for three square meals a day
and more to wear than one rarely-
washed dhoti or lap-lap.
The main problem seems to be to
raise the productive-capacity of the
newly-constituted and poor countries
now short of capital resources. And
it is enough to daunt the bravest
economic planner, since capital is
naturally attracted to the points at
which it has the greatest earning-
power.
nrO satisfy the demand for meat, and
A for sufficient other nutritive food, is
becoming increasingly difficult, and
those countries which have surpluses
have a cost-structure which makes it
possible for them to supply the have-
not countries only by dumping at
unpayable prices to the detriment of
primary-producing countries.
Science is on the way to finding
solutions. For instance, it is reported
in scientific circles in Australia that
British research-workers have achieved
one of their greatest triumphs of all
time by breaking-down those barriers
in the knowledge of basic amino-acids
which have hitherto prevented the
practical synthetising of protein. And
this might have the effect of opening-
up illimitable vistas in the production
of cheap artificial foods. The conse-
quences might be revolutionary.
Meantime, it is sound that British
Commonwealth legislators should be
able to hold uninhibited discussion of
their problems, agreeing on those
which can be agreed on. at least in
part (such as inter-Commonwealth
foreign policy and defence) and discus-
sing the basic problems which cannot
at present be overcome because of
conflicting standards of subsistence-
level but which all are eager to solve.


A NEW SUNRISE


PLAIN ENGLISH
"Peace"—In Retrospect
Peace — it’s wonderful !
The Soviet Union (a) described-
Chamberlain as a murderer because he
would not fight for the Reds in Spain ;
(b) denounced him because he wanted
to establish peace with Hitler; (c)
denounced Hitler as . a blood-drunk
gangster ; ( d ) denounced Mussolini as
ditto; (e) ordered its pre-war cruisers
from Mussolini’s yards, which were
kept going largely by Russian trade in
1936-38; (/) denounced the Anglo-
French as aggressors as soon as Hitler
committed aggression on Poland, and
shared the spoils of his attack, besides
snatching the Baltic countries and trying
to grab Finland ; ( g ) armed to the teeth
with universal conscription as soon as
the muddled World War II was over
and its Allies had almost completely
disarmed; ( h ) has since, by itself or
through its Chinese agents, grabbed
country after country and shoved them
behind the Iron Curtain, engaging in
military suppression of the weak, provo-
cation to violence and rape and ravage
of territories.
And now it would appear that the
simple leaders of the Peace Conference
organised in Melbourne from Moscow
to help condition the wobbly members
of the British Commonwealth for Iron
Curtain conquest, cold or otherwise, still
believe that the politicians of the West
are the opponents of Russian-sponsored
peace—wicked, warmongering aggressors.
[From “Collins Street”!
Looking at the exhibition put on as
a counter to the Communist “Peace”
Congress in Melbourne, any softening
of your intellect by Khrushchev’s jolly
speeches and democratic behavior in the
U.S. is checked and the healthy harden-
ing that returns will probably endure.
I had a preview of it, at 506 Elizabeth
Street, which was formerly a large
motor - showroom, while voluntary
workers . were putting up the 40 large
panels which record pictorially the
years of Communism, classed into purge
and terror, “classless” society, Soviet
imperialism and the fight for freedom.
The major terrors, deceptions,
treachery and aggressions of the Soviet
are part of modern history, but the
exhibition recalls the others, the now,
perhaps, forgotten ones: the elimination
of the 10,000 Polish officers during the
war; the horrors of the Communist
guerrillas in Greece in 1947 ; the break-
up of the freedom-fighters in Hungary
as early as 1947 ; Latvia, Estonia,
Lithuania and back to Georgia; the
crushing of the East Berlin demonstra-
tion in 1953 ; and, not merely Minds-
zenty, but Reintys and Volaj and other
leading-lights of the church.
The panels are stark and striking, and
have been arranged, in some cases, to
show the signing of the pact of friend-
ship with a small country followed by
the march-in of Russian tanks. There
are appropriate cynical quotations from
Lenin, Stalin and the other great pro-
tagonists of peace and goodwill to all
men.
Time and the Con.-men
The Communist con.-men pulling the
strings of the “Peace” puppet-show in
Melbourne chose well when they included
J. B. Priestley in their cast. Innocents
attending the congress found him exuding
the spirit of good-companionship and
bluff Yorkshire ham which is just what
the Comrades needed to give their stunt
an air of respectability and sincerity.
What’s more, J.B. himself is probably
convinced that the show is respectable
in the extreme.
His most quoted contribution to the
opening day was pure ham —and typical
Priestley:
As I was coming here I passed a Soccer-
match. And I thought of the days in
Yorkshire when I was young and I used
to play Soccer. I thought I’d rather be
going to the match than coming here onto
this platform. Then I thought to myself,
“If fat old men like you don’t go onto
platforms like this, young men won’t be
playing Soccer in Yorkshire —or anywhere
else.”
A delightful little homily to address
to an audience already convinced that
it was furthering world-peace (of a sort)
by attending the meeting. But, on
analysis, pure ham, or alternatively,
poppycock. It recalls a 8.8. C. broadcast
Priestley made nearly 20 years ago, during
the blitz on London. On that occasion
he related how, while coming to the
studio, he had passed, not a Soccer-match,
but a pond in a London park, with ducks
swimming peacefully on it. From this
tranquil little scene Priestley drew faith
to convince his audience that despite the
blitz, London would not fall, Britain
would not be defeated.
London didn’t fall and Britain wasn’t
defeated, but if these two disasters had
happened it is hard to believe that the
ducks would have worried a scrap. There
were probably ducks swimming on a
Thames-side pond before the Romans
conquered Britain, before the Angles,
the Danes and the Normans conquered
it in their turn. And if nuclear war
killed every person in the United King-
dom it wouldn’t be long before the ducks
were swimming in the ponds again.
As soothing-syrup, J.B.’s little homily
probably had its value, but ducks on the
pond had nothing to do with Britain’s
chances of survival, and the lads playing
Soccer had nothing to do with the
genuineness or otherwise of the Mel-
bourne congress. As a trueborn York-
shireman Priestley should really have
asked himself why on earth they were
playing Soccer in the cricket season.
Un-diplomatic Doings
(From Canberra]
In globe - circling Minister Casey’s
absence, the External Affairs boys
decided that Acting External Affairs
Minister Barwick should host a reception
to delegates to the Parliamentary Con-
ference, their High Commissioners and
others in the Canberra-party bracket at
Parliament House last Friday afternoon
—6-7.30 p.m.
This being decided upon, gilt-edged
invitations were issued to all those on
the invitee-list and arrangements made
for the reception.
No sooner had this been done than,
to the horror of the protocol section, an
invitation came to Sir Garfield Barwick
himself to. attend a reception—6.3o-8 p.m.
at the RUSSIAN Embassy, the first to be
held there since the resumption of rela-
tions earlier this year.
Not only did Barwick receive an
invitation, but so did the whole Diplo-
matic Corps, including the Common-
wealth High Commissioners, and many
others on the party-list, most of whom
had accepted for the Barwick party.
By then it was too late to change
arrangements for the party at Parlia-
ment House ; many of the invitees had
already accepted Barwick’s invitation,
but didn’t wish to offend the Russians
—particularly as it was their first recep-
tion and one to commemorate the
Russian Revolution.
The result was the greatest collection
of clock-watchers ever to assemble at a
reception at Parliament House, all look-
ing at their watches to ensure they
remained for a respectable period, but
also to ensure that they left themselves
enough time to dash to the Russian
Embassy, a couple of miles away, in time
to spend a respectable period there also.
Barwick himself was caught completely
—as host he couldn’t leave the Parlia-
ment House reception to get to the
Russians at all, even though he was
Acting Minister for External Affairs.
Commonsense and the
Summit
Mr. Menzies, as usual, seems to have
dominated the Commonwealth Parlia-
mentary Conference, and his contribu-
tion on foreign affairs and the summit-
conference was full of commonsense.
He is still obviously holding reserva-
tions about the good faith of Communist
countries which continue to demand “dis-
armament” and “peace” while breaking
the peace of other countries, maintain-
ing it by force in the slave lands of
eastern Europe, and infiltrating peaceful
countries of the type of Australia, trying
to stir-up among their citizens the con-
cept that their Governments are “war-
mongering” institutions itching to get
at the throat of the Soviet Union and
other “peace-loving nations.”
He echoed the distaste for the kind
of conference now fashionable, with the
four negotiators “practically disappear-
ing into the middle of a positive army of
people.”
His idea of the informal conferences
between leaders who “drop-in” occasion-
ally on one another, but without the kind
of ballyhoo and propaganda which
accompanies these visits, at present seems
to go to the root of the problem of
successful negotiation. It is unthinkable
that a single series of meetings can even


establish confidence between leaders or
enable them to know each other or read
each other’s minds, characters and inten-
tions, especially when the gatherings are
held in an atmosphere of formality.
Most of the problems of relationships
within the British Commonwealth have
been solved through informality. The
inter-Commonwealth telephone has be-
come one of the greatest pieces of
machinery for overcoming difficulties and
possible misunderstanding.
A world irr which the leaders, who are
the real and ultimate arbiters of peace
and war, are in regular and informal
contact, as are the British, Americans,
Australians and Canadians in the various
national Ministries, would be nearer to
peace than one in which everything is
so stiff and formal and hedged about
with protocol and jargon that even
arranging a meeting is a major task
calling for months of international poker.
Mr. Menzies’s grasp of the realities
is far tighter than that of Earl Attlee,
who talks about producing peace among
the popular “foothills” of the masses
rather than through the efforts of leaders.
At the same time Attlee asks for a
“properly constituted authority whose
word would be law in the world—an
authority which could make decisions
and enforce them.”
That is exactly what Communism has
been after from the days of Lenin —
provided, of course, the Kremlin is the
“authority.”
Censor Bucked the Censors
[From Canberra]
By a queer twist of fate, the one person
who last week “bucked” the official
censorship placed on news-releases from
the Commonwealth Parliamentary Asso-
ciation Conference was one of Aus-
tralia's most notorious war-time censors,
Arthur A. Calwell.
Calwell, as war-time Minister for
Information, made “news” by his
attempted fanatical (and political) cen-
sorship of newspapers at the height of
the war.
However, last week he was on the
receiving-end of the blue-pencil after he
had delivered a long speech to the con-
ference on the White Australia policy.
An official resume of his speech, issued
to the press later in the day, contained
only two paragraphs in reference to his
defence of Australia’s'immigration laws.
Calwell was incensed that those respon-
sible for issuing communiques should
have so emasculated his speech that he
immediately complained to the chairman
of the conference, Australia’s Senate
President, Sir Alister McMullin.
He received permission from
McMullin to call a press-conference, at
which he read the complete transcript
of his speech, explaining in detail why
Australia placed certain restrictions on
the entry of Asians into Australia, but
claiming that Australia had every right
to determine her own homogeneous
population-content.
Calwell said, in effect, Australia’s
immigration laws were her own business
and other countries’ laws were theirs, and
they should not criticise or attempt to
interfere with Australia.
Apart from the opening ceremony of
the conference last Monday-week, all
proceedings had been closed to news-
men.
With important topics such as Com-
monwealth trade, economic co-operation,
immigration laws and education, there
was a feast of good newsy material. But
what was received by the press were
officially edited versions of each indi-
vidual speaker, with the “meaty” parts,
in the main, omitted.
This was indicated by Calwell, who,
in opening his press-conference, said
that he had made his speech in reply
to several criticisms by Asian and
African delegates against Australia’s
immigration policy.
Yet in all the official communiques
issued —and there were plenty of them —
not one reference was made to criticism
of the policy by any delegates.
Having It Both Ways
Any ghosts of departed Labor leaders
associated with the foundation of the
Commonwealth must have been dumb-
founded as they heard A. A. Calwell,
Labor’s deputy - leader, assuring the
Nigerians that White Australia did not
exist as a policy, and that it was merely
a phrase that had “grown into use 40
years before Australia became a Federa-
tion as an example of journalese.”
At the time of Federation the White
Australia issue was a vital one with
Labor, and the slogan of some of its
members was actually “Vote for Bloggs
and a White Australia.”
Labor pressure was a strong influence
on Barton in the drafting of his immigra-
tion bills during the first Commonwealth
session.
Labor was so strongly in favor of
actually stating a specific White Aus-
tralia policy in the legislation that he
had great difficulty in avoiding it,
especially since Deakin was behind the
idea.
Barton explained, in fact, apologetically,
after numerous citations to show the
effects of racial contamination, that the
bills were drawn on an “educational”
basis rather than on racial prohibition
because Britain’s Joe Chamberlain had
advised him in effect that disqualifications
on the ground of race or color would be
offensive to various countries under
British rule.
How little “White Australia” was an
invention of the press, and how much
it was the policy of the Labor party, was
illustrated by the amendment of J. C.
Watson, who moved to replace the
education-test by a prohibition against
“any person who is an aboriginal native
of Asia, Africa, or of the islands thereof.”
He argued that, while admitting the ques-
tion to be “tinged to a large extent with
considerations of an industrial .nature,”
the objection to Asian and African
immigration “lies in the main in the
possibility of racial contamination.”
Some Labor members, when British
preference came to be debated, even tried
to have inserted in the Customs Tariff
Act a provision that British preferences
should apply only to goods proved to
have been manufactured with white
labor and carried to Australia in white-
manned ships.
Country Industry
With the population of Melbourne grow-
ing at an unprecedented rate, the
need for an overall policy to
encourage decentralisation has been
recognised by all the parties in the Vic-
torian Parliament, and each wishes to
begin tackling the mounting problem by
its own method.
The Government wants .to continue
its present policy of providing aid and
funds for country-town development
from instrumentalities, and in addition
the L.C.P. has decided to ask Canberra
to make tax-concessions to industries
established 60 miles from a capital-city.
A private Labor bill would keep new
industry out of congested areas, and the
Country party is pressing for an all-party
select committee.
Bolte’s chief consideration as Premier
has been to develop Victoria, and there
can be no quibble about his success in this
respect. Any attempt at Government
direction to a private firm on where to
site its factory would be a flat nega-
tion of his chief selling-points of a fine
climate in Victoria for free enterprise.
Facts and figures refute the Opposi-
tion’s claim that the Government is
ignoring the interest of the country, but
industry is not growing in the country
proportionately to the remarkable
expanse in the city.
Labor’s bill will incorporate some of
the principles of the U.K. Acts. Accord-
ing to Opposition-leader Stoneham, it
has been proved beyond doubt in Britain
that a Government can effectively inter-
vene in locating industry without actually
directing a firm where to go ; but,
according to other authorities, industries
in Britain which have been nudged by
concessions into areas where there has
been high unemployment have too fre-
quently soon been seeking additional
concessions.
Some hostility has been evident in
Government replies to requests by the
C.P. for an all-party committee to study
decentralisation, probably because there
have been so many committees report-
ing on decentralisation in the past.
The position has, however, changed.
For most of Australian history it has
been a struggle to get an industry started
anywhere. With the free flow of over-
seas capital and the local easier money-
market, it is quite possible the proposed
committee could make valuable sugges-
tions for the guidance of Governments
in the dispersal of industry and popula-
tion.

"AND IT'S PRINTED

/~\ur villagers by the muddy stream
know the uses of radio - taxis.
From base at one company came the
message: “Car 19, Mrs. K’foops o’
Grass Street, East St. Kilda, wants a
small loaf of bread. Buy the bread at
the nearest shop and charge from meter-
throw, now.” “You kidding?” from the
taxi - man. “No, get cracking,” from
base. “And make her cut you a sand-
wich,” drawled-in a listening driver

“Wusslean”: I was pleased to learn,
from a newspaper statement attributed to
a senior officer of Victoria’s Health Com-
mission, that the commission and the
Royal Children’s Hospital had “done a
lot of investigation into the unnecessary
poisoning of children.”
“Sister Ellell”: Frantic for time and
parking-space, I put my car into an
almost too small space, with ominous
scraping of the back on sloping ground—
and there she was, foundered. I said to
some college lads: “Could you heave her
up while I drive forward?” This they
did most willingly. I thanked them from
the bottom of my heart, and one replied :
“What it is to be young and healthy! ”

“A.G.H”: Queensland Education De-
partment is clamping-down on ring-ins.
Teachers finding baby-fat, infantile
habits, speech-backwardness and other
evidences of immaturity will be able next
year to demand proof of the child’s age.
This will save the tooth-test. The ring-ins
in a school are known for sure when the
time comes for the appearing of the
second-teeth. One girl at our school
retained her baby-teeth till she was in
Grade IV. Needless to say, teachers
found her a difficult pupil; definitely
very babyish.

“Miss M”: Paper-oil (B. 26/8/’59)
must be versatile stuff. As kids we
manufactured it by burning scraps of
brown-paper on a saucer, and used it for
ringworm on cats. As a young nurse I
recommended it, unofficially, for a few
stubborn cases of the same disease in
children, and acquired a reputation for
cleverness that a skin-specialist might
have envied. I still don’t know whether
the success was due to faith-healing,
whether the stuff did have some beneficial
effect, or whether, being quite neutral,
it merely allowed Nature to do its own
healing.

“Jock”: Lithgow (N.S.W.) Workmen’s
Club, established by Act of Parliament
in 1887, is the oldest club of its kind in
Australia. There was 11 p.m. closing in
the early days, and the establishment
served thirsty steelmakers coming off
the night-shift at the nearby Sandford
(later Hoskins) ironworks. The club
has begun a £lOO,OOO building-pro-
gramme which will provide another two-
story wing. Membership, once restricted
by law to 800, is now 2000.

“Ceg”: The Royal Mail, on the
south-east corner of Bourke and Swan-
ston Streets, Melbourne, is advertised
for sale as a first-class retail-trade site.
It may thus meet the same fate as its
erstwhile cobber the Orient, which used
to stand on the north-east corner of the
same streets, the site of which is now
occupied by a huge department-store.
The old saying, “From Rags to Riches,”
might be amended to “From Beer to
Rags,” by which, of course, I refer to
the rag-trade. The aphorism seems to
be full of merit, whichever way you
look at it. Back in 1914 the Counter-
lunch menu of the Royal Mail offered
choice of roast - beef, ham, fish - rissoles,
sheep’s-trotters, ox-tongue, corned-beef,
sausages, cheese, Vienna - rolls —plus a
full pint of beer —all for 3d. Now, who
dares to talk of unbounded prosperity
in the year 1959?

“Cuscus”: How much injustice is done
to Australia’s discoverers by • the place-
names given their discoveries? Take
Coff’s Harbor. This should really be
spelled, and probably pronounced,
“Korff’s Harbor” after Captain John
Korff, shipbuilder and marine-surveyor,
who discovered the harbor in the 1840’s.
The name became corrupted to Coff’s,
and although there is agitation to have
the spelling corrected, the Lands Depart-
ment says that the best it can do is to put
the name Korff’s in brackets after Coff’s
in its maps. Another case is that of the
Burdekin River in Queensland, which
was named the Wickham by the Captain
Wickham who discovered it. Later on
Leichhardt called it the Burdekin after
Sydney’s Thomas Burdekin, who had
helped to finance the Leichhardt expedi-
tion. Unfair to Wickham!

“Sanasi”: A Jack Davey fan (Mrs.
and I once eased him of much money,
a washer and 201 packets of detergent),
I was always amazed at his discrimina-
tion between the dumb contestant and
the not-so-dumb to brilliant. With clever
people Jack realised there was no time
for foolery and got on with the job,
although he knew a win would severely
nudge the sponsor’s shekels ; but with
the dumb performer he used every
minute of the time to entertain and
amuse his listeners. Anyhow, what else
could he do with one such not-so-well-
informed contestant as this: “What is a
widgeon?” “A female bodgie”; “What
are sabots?” “The seventh day—Sunday”;
“What is a gargoyle?” “A mouth- or
throat-wash.” It’s years since I heard
those three boners, but even if I hadn’t
written them down at the time I’d still
remember them!

“Phin”: Tatt.’s - lottery management
prints on each ticket a near-enough like-
ness of George Adams, its founder. In
his will he generously remembered his
staff. Disconsolately viewing a result-
slip I recall that at one time the postal
authorities refused to deliver mail
addressed to George Adams, so appli-
cations for tickets were addressed to
his bankers. Staff each day discreetly
entered the bank through a rear entrance,
conveniently opposite the lottery-office.
Many of the drawings were based on
race-meetings, and a constant patron, a
farmer in the Tassie midlands, urged
that a better deal be given him, saying
that he was due for a horse, at least. With
his ticket he found a note suggesting he
supply a bag of chaff, when a horse
would be sent. Tatt.’s stepped in on the
raging torrent of abuse, and gave a
week’s suspension to the humorist, the
manager being not without a saving
sense.

“Wasmiss”: During a sudden down-
pour in a busy suburb I took shelter in

worriedly ringing the manager to ask
the cash price of a vacuum-cleaner.

“Sackfair”: A group of young motor-
cyclists with their pillion-riders arrived
at the picnic-grounds and dismounted.
Immediately the young Marlon Brandos
congregated together around first one
bike then another, completely ignoring
the girls. Post-mortems on the morning’s
run were held, engines revved-up and
adjustments made with spanners ; then
the males flung themselves down on the
grass to lounge, laze and talk. The girls
stood about aimlessly for a time before
drifting over to the kiosk. When they
returned each girl was bearing two ice-
creams, one for herself and one for her
boyfriend. The boys accepted theirs
with the briefest of nods and without
bothering to sit-up. I could just imagine
the girls of our generation doing a crawl-
act like that, or allowing us to get away
with the lord-and-master stunt. And the
modern damsel thinks she has achieved
equality!

“Maitri”: I seldom bother about going

for politeness’ sake, inquire after a wife,
sister, brother, father or mother. Far,
far too frequently, he puts on that
solemn, bereaved look and asks, “Haven’t


you heard?” Then he relates the sad
circumstances of the demise and I make
a vow to myself not to neglect those
vital columns in future. I could have
bitten my tongue out after I’d asked a
bloke how his wife was and he’d come
up with the ominous question. Ashamed
and confused, I didn’t concentrate on
the details he went into ; then, suddenly,
I realised that here was no tale of a re-
gretted decease. He was saying “Her
family, you know, are very religious and
down on lotteries, but, blow me down,
she had to go and buy a ticket and collect

“M urr a y Swag-

I have vivid recollec-
tions of one Digger’s
opinion of official
photographer Cap-
tain G H. Wilkins.
A corporal in a base
photographic studio,
my friend was pro-
moted to Wilkins’s
assistant with a jump
to the rank of W. 0.1.
There was some
jealousy among
n.c.o.s senior to him,
until he came back to
the unit on a visit.
“Anyone can have
my job,” he declared,
“and I'll take a nice soft job in the front-
line with the infantry. This mug takes me
out into No-man’s Land with cameras
waiting to photograph an attack as they
hop over. He's too mad to know the

It might have been a little gem but

“Narumee”: Women’s magazine
short-story: “She melted into his arms
like a pound of butter.” Because they
were lovingly spread—or was he too hot
to handle her?
A Sydney motorist who habitually
steams around the suburbs at 35 to
45 m.p.h., and has so far managed to
avoid the uniformed Nemesis, has often
been the object of mild rebuke by his
passenger-son. Then on a black day the
son came home and spilled the evil
tidings that he himself had been picked-up
for speeding, whereupon his sire gave
him the horselaugh and said something
about “Look who’s talking!” But the
irony rested not so much on that as on
the circumstances of it—aided by the
high rating motorbikes have in fine-
potential. Apparently the cop was a
motorbike hater, for son was boxed
between two cars and had to go at their
speeds. And what made him mad was
that the two car-drivers got out of it!

bank —a crowd of 300 assembled to pay
their respects. At 6.30 p.m. a number
of them joined hands to sing “Auld Lang

They said so at the City Court next
morning when five appeared on charges
of offensive behavior ; one pleaded that
there was a lot of sentiment attached to
that hotel, that he’d been going there for
years, and that it was his wedding anni-
versary. Nor did the Bench shut the gates

“Murray Swagman”: The par. about
the pilot flying under wires 27ft. from

of France in 1918 when a pilot made a

machine with a wing-span of 38ft. 4in.
between two hangar-tents 42ft. apart.
He did it three times, and was darting
round the camp like a swallow when the
irate C.O. phoned the Flight-Commander.
“Have that b fool sent to me as
soon as he lands,” he snapped. A few
minutes later there was a call from the
Flight. “If you want Smith up at
Squadron H.Q., sir, send down your car
and we’ll put him in it.”, “Has the dam-
fool hurt himself?” roared the C.O.
“Serve him right!” “Hurt, no!” said
the Flight-Commander. “He can still fly
like a pigeon, but we had to lift him out
of the cockpit. He’s so drunk he can’t
stand up!”

“Mark Heim”: Took up the Dialogues
of Lucian, 2nd century a.d., to find that
the opening speaker, Menippus, was just
back from a voyage to the moon. He had
flown there and found the distance to
be 3000 furlongs. Thence he had taken-
off and 500 parasangs beyond had
reached the sun, where, naturally
enough, he had not tarried, but had pro-
ceeded to the outer stars and finally to
the citadel of Zeus himself. He beat
the Russians to it by 18 centuries —with
far happier results than are likely now.
A SAFE BET
“In adopting a resolution calling on the
Administration to stop gambling among natives
in Papua and New Guinea, a conference of
Christian missionaries in Port Moresby was
told that some natives were even gambling
away theft wives.”
The Flemington punter may gaily
Have backed a hot tip by a daily,
And then with a horrible wail he
May afterwards leap on his lid.
Aware that his creditors clamant
Will soon be demanding some payment,
He’ll recklessly Moscow his raiment
In final and desperate bid.
When that follows the rest down the
drain,
And he finds he is clean out of pelf,
One notion he might entertain
He would, if he could, hock himself.
Well, he must wait perforce
Till next payday comes round
Before once again fronting
The books, pick a horse
And again do the round
Of his airy-hopes punting.
But our fuzzy-haired Papuan brother
Learned betting-frustrations to smother.
One bright idea after another
He tried before hitting this, square :
Although it might earn him some hisses,
He could possibly leap Luck’s abysses
By finally putting his missus
On moke or on open-misere.
And, should his plunge miss-out, that
buck
Will, if she’s a magger or shrew,
Be prepared to dismiss his stiff luck
With a laugh—and a hearty one, too !
To those boongs we’d appear
By the way that WE bet
As babes barely teethin’,
White man, snuff-out that sneer,
And acknowledge a debt —
We can learn from the heathen!

Just the way of it ...
By ADRIAN WINTLE
■4 mt ichael paused in the
j\/I laneway and ram
JLV-L sprinkled his black
duffel-coat. He felt
like going home, but Christine
said to meet her at six in the
Alceon. All around him floated
the sounds of Friday-evening
city traffic. The lane, narrow
and glistening, was virtually
deserted, except for the occa-
sional dark figure moving to or
from the Alceon coffee-lounge.
The trouble is, he thought
as he crossed to the other side
and wandered down towards
the Alceon, the trouble is . . .
what? So you’re a Tech,
student, and because you wear
a certain type of clothing you
are presumed to be a beatnik.
Or maybe because you go to
the Alceon on Friday even-
ings. As he was going. As
Christine went. Like Benny,
and Paul, and all those girls
in black, green and red stock-
ings.
He stopped at the entrance.
Inside there was a lot of
cigarette-smoke and a hellish
row.
“Here he is! ” someone
shouted, and he was immedi-
ately propelled into the centre
of a familiar group. Before
he greeted them Michael
caught the eyes of two matrons
sitting in a corner seat,
obviously revelling in the arty
atmosphere (“My dear, it was
exciting. We had coffee at the
Alceon. Oh, you know the
place—yes, where they go. Oh,
you remember the article in
City Life!”)
“Hullo, you abstracted pig.”
Benny held a tiny cup of
coffee. He was wearing green
corduroys, a threequarter-
length fawn gaberdine coat and
a brilliant yellow cravat. He
smiled. “Chris said you’d be
here.”
Michael pulled out a packet
of cigarettes. “Yes. Where is
she?”
“Over there.” Benny waved
in the vague direction of the
far corner.
The black-haired girl in
green stockings said, “Mean
bastard. Give us a fag.”
“Sorry,” Michael mur-
mured, trying to stop wonder-
ing where Chris was. He lit
one, drew on it and handed
it to the girl. He didn’t know
her name, but he’d seen her
around. That immediately
established her as a close friend.
Benny said, “Is there a party
tonight?”
The other two in the group
—a bearded and loosely-
dressed young man and an
abstracted girl in abstract
colors—stopped chattering.
“Yes,” Michael said. “At
Hornsby. Pete’s place.”
Benny whistled. “Pete’s
place? Thought he’d never
have another, not after the last
one.”
“That was beaut,” the black-
haired girl said. “God I was
full that night.”
“Gutter type,” the bearded
man said, draining his cup.
“Who’s for a beer?”
Benny ignored him. He
addressed Michael. “Pete’s
place? Who’s got a car?”
Michael said, “I don’t
know,” and then felt hot and
cold but rather glad he’d left
his Anglia at home.
The bearded man left them,
and Benny started talking to
the black-haired girl. Michael
strolled over and joined the
queue at the counter. When he
came back Christine was there
with a tall Van Gogh type.
/Christine was wearing
matador-pants, a sloppy
orange sweater and a silver-
medallion round her neck. She
looked wild, uninhibited and
ravishing.
“Hello, darling,” she said.
“It’s been a perfectly foul day.
By the way, this is Neville. He
spends his time sketching
naked women.”
Neville inclined his head and
said brusquely, “Chris has been
telling me about you. Tech,
student, aren’t you?”
Michael said uneasily “Yes.
But I wasn’t there today. Had
some important business to do.
Meeting Chris, for instance.”
Neville let that one slide.
Christine said quickly “Will
someone get me some coffee?”
“Off you go, hero,” said
Michael.
“Now, now,” said Neville.
He sauntered away. Michael
glared at his retreating back.
“Darling . . .” Chris began,
but Michael interrupted.
“Which sewer did you find him
in?”
“Ker-rude,” she pouted.
“Are you going to the party?”
Michael said “Look, let’s
get this straight. You ask me
to meet you here, O.K. You
turn-up with a Van Gogh and
then ask me if I’m going to
the party—which, of course,
you’re already going to, and
with Ziffo.”
“But darling,” Christine said,
“one never knows whom one
will meet. Does one?”
Neville came back with the
coffee and accidentally bumped
Michael. “Sorry, old boy,” he
said.
Michael said “Well, I’d
better be going.”
Chris caught his arm. “We’re
going to the Rendezvous.
Please come.” She leant close
to him. • Insincere bitch,
thought Michael.
So they went to the Rendez-
vous, a smoky little licensed
eating-house on the outskirts
of the Cross where wine could
be bought at ridiculously low
prices. Halfway through the
second bottle, while they were
waiting for the meal, Neville
said, “You know, working all
day makes you thirsty. Not
out of the top drawer, this
vintage, but nevertheless re-
freshing.”
He was addressing Christine,
and Michael, who had bought
the wine, felt suddenly angry.
“Drink the lot,” he said,
pushing the bottle across the
table to Neville.
“Darlings! ” said Christine,
“Let’s not get upset.”
Neville ignored her. He
reached for the bottle and
filled his glass. Then he filled
Michael’s glass.
This sudden overture of
matiness confused Michael.
Neville must be mellowing, he
thought.
Mercifully, the food
arrived, and interrupted
Christine’s shallow, “oh-darl-
ings” - punctuated small - talk.
Neville simply sat there and
ate. He didn’t say anything
until the plate was empty and
he was mopping the gravy away

POLITICAL POINTS
Ike was a little off the beam when,
in announcing his plans To visit Italy,
Turkey, Greece, Pakistan, India,
Afghanistan, Iran and Morocco before
attending the Western summit - meeting
in Paris, he said he would be the first
U.S. President ever to visit Asia. When
he’s giving Iran’s capital, Teheran, the
once-over he’ll probably see the initials
F.D.R. carved here and there. Roose-
velt conferred there with Churchill and
Stalin for five days at the end of Novem-

Slips of memory seemed to be the
fashion last week. U.K. Minister of
State for Foreign Affairs David Ormsby-
Gore, seeking to allay fears that France’s
proposed nuclear-test might be dangerous
to villages in the Sahara, said that the
French cracker would be an atomic
bomb, “not a hydrogen-bomb such as
Britain had discharged on its Australian
proving-ground. That makes a profound
difference. In Australia the nearest town
was only 62 miles from the testing-site.
The French site is 75 miles from the
nearest inhabited oasis.”
The difference is not so profound as
the Minister believes. No hydrogen-
bomb has ever been exploded in Aus-
tralia ; the devices tested at Woomera,
Monte Bello and Maralinga were atomic
bombs.
• •
Khrushchev declared last week that
the Red Army was “the only army in
the world that ever voted for its own
dissolution.” The vote doesn’t seem to
be a very powerful instrument in Soviet
Russia. The Red Army is about 20 times
as powerful as it was when it voted.

Territories Minister Hasluck’s faith in
human nature must have revived a little
last week, after the battering he has
taken from some of his own party.
Menzies told of a letter from missionaries
in Papua and New Guinea praising
Hasluck’s administration. They claimed
he had shown a degree of humaneness
not experienced before and that the
Territory had progressed remarkably
under his administration. They urged
Hasluck to “carry on” the good work.

No information about the Melbourne
“peace” congress that had not already
been widely publicised had been given
by the Security Service to Professor
Stout, Attorney-General Barwick said at
the weekend. The three members of the
sponsoring committee were the Rev.
A. M. Dickie (chairman), the Rev. R. J.
Hartley (treasurer) and Samuel Gold-
bloom (secretary). The first two were
foundation-members of the Australian
Peace Council, an offshoot of the World
Peace Council set-up in 1948 as an instru-
ment of Soviet foreign policy. A recent
letterhead showed them as office-bearers.
Dickie and Goldbloom were Australian
delegates to the World Peace Council

Federal Cabinet is thrashing-out the
new three-year defence-plan, and a
battle is reported to be raging about
equipment rather than manpower. It is
hoped that the apex of the argument is
the discomfort of the enemy rather than
the comfort of the men. Recent articles
by Hanson Baldwin, a noted military
critic, about the state of the U.S. forces
have received the backing of war leaders
headed by Admiral Nimitz. If they are
true it would seem that a large portion
of Uncle Sam’s defenders are not
capable of dealing with anything but
their dinners.
R. G. Casey says that a “most en-
couraging aspect” of the 12-nation con-
ference on Antarctica which has been
sitting for three weeks is that “cold-war
issues never once intruded.” There is
a Russian proverb which says: “The
bear does not show his nose till he is
hungry.” Casey should paste it in his
hat.

The advantages of the Communists
in their advance into Asia are clear from
the report of the Security Council Com-
mittee of Argentinians, Japanese and
others on the war in Laos. It was pos-
sible for witnesses to identify some of
the infiltrators as having “ethnic Viet-
namese characteristics,” but not to
identify them as belonging to the North
Vietnamese Communist Army. There
seemed no doubt about the fact that the
rebels received arms, ammunition and
supplies and the help of political cadres
from the Vietnam Communist Govern-
ment. In Australia it is equally difficult
to say who directs the Communist party’s
policy, but there is no doubt about where
its policies come from.

Brisbane City Council has declared
war on “sluggers”—motorists who feed
worthless slugs into parking-meters. It
appears there are more “sluggers” in
Brisbane than in Sydney or Melbourne.
They have thumbed 12,000 slugs into
the meters since August, 1957, obtaining
parking-time worth £3OO. Prosecutions
are pending against three alleged
“sluggers,” and traps are being set for
others.

Although till a late stage in Mel-
bourne’s beer-war it looked like a life-
and-death struggle, the Australian Hotels

In May, 1945, it was announced that
the 10th volume of National Security
regulations was about to be issued, and
that about 200 sets of regulations cover-
ing industry, private life and recreation
were then in operation. That era, it
might be thought, was the heyday of the
bureaucrat. Yet how many Federal pub-
lic-servants were there then, and how
many are there now?

Queensland Government has decided
to abolish price-control on a further
string of oddly-differing commodities,
including tea, sugar, bran, pollard,
malted-milk, breakfast-foods, galvanised-

controlled include bread, butter, cream,
flour, kerosene, margarine and some
meats.

“Stromlo”: Air-travellers may, after
all, have to wait longer for 24-hour
liquor facilities at airports. S.A. Premier
Playford told a TV-audience that his
State would challenge in the High Court
any Federal legislation aimed at extend-
ing liquor-trading hours at airports. Tom
is a regular traveller ; he’s also a tee-
totaller. But what is the proportion of
non-drinkers among air-passengers?

A 23-year-old limitation on the free-
dom of the press will be revoked by a
bill before the Queensland Assembly to
amend the Vagrants, Gaming and Other
Offences Act. Under a 1936 amend-
ment, journalists and others were re-
quired to divulge to police their source
of information when certain news con-
cerning a proposed legislative or Par-
liamentary paper was published. The
Forgan Smith Government introduced
the provision after “The Courier-Mail”
had published some details of a draft
bill to regulate racing. It has never been
invoked. Introduction of the bill to
nullify it followed intense lobbying by
the A.J.A.

“Murray Swagman”: When Albert
Monk gets back from his latest 1.L.0.
jaunt he wont be returning to his native
land (B. 21/10/’59). Ernie Monk, an
officer of the explosives-manufacturing
industry in England, was appointed a
foreman in the cordite-factory at
Maribyrnong (Vic.), and arrived in Mel-
bourne in 1911, bringing his family with
him. Albert, his son, was then a boy
of about six. There are a lot of things
Australian can be blamed for, but it
isn’t Albert Monk’s birthplace.

Publication of figures from important
sub - branches showing overwhelming
majorities in favor of a change in Anzac
Day observance in Victoria has brought
a smart response from the State executive
of the R.S.L., which has for years
thwarted a change. “We would prefer
branches did not disclose to public or
press the results of their plebiscites until
all branches have finished voting.”

Victorian Labor has decided to oppose
the off-course tote bill. This means that
the Country party can decide its fate in
the Legislative Council, where the
Government is one vote short of an
overall majority. The C.P. says it has
not yet made up its mind, which means
it is riding the most difficult of all races
—a waiting race in front. But that wise
old hoop, Hyland, has been getting ex-
perience at that game since long before
Bobby Lewis retired.

New South Wales Labor Government
was caught napping during the debate on
the Local Government Bill, and the Oppo-
sition won a division for the first time in
years. Later the Government used its
numbers to reverse the amendment thus
passed, but the Speaker’s tactics in affect-
ing this are under fire on technical points.

On October 28, for the first time in
Brisbane City Council’s history, an
alderman took his seat in the council-
chamber clad in pyjamas, dressing-gown
and slippers.
Alderman A. R. Cornelius, Citizen’s
Municipal Organisation Party-whip, had
undergone an operation nine days earlier.
A colleague raced to the hospital to
fetch him —because ten Labor aldermen
were boycotting the meeting, leaving it
one short of a quorum. This was in
protest against council’s adjournment the
previous afternoon to make way for a
civic reception—Labor claimed it hadn’t
been consulted.
When Aid. Cornelius was escorted
into the council-chamber by two col-
leagues, the Labor aldermen, who were
in their party-room, decided to attend
the meeting. Said their leader, Aid.
Bennett, “When we saw him we felt
sorry for him, and decided to go in so
that he could go straight back to
hospital.”

Religious and other interests which
are trying to get the Government to
remove from the Divorce Bill the clause
which provides for divorce by mutual
consent after a five-year separation, have

jaw when he’s asked whether he intends

Impressions of the visiting Parlia-
mentary delegates about the leafy
Federal capital are many and various.
They range from a “scene in the Forest
of Arden” to a “salesmen’s sample of
specimen Californian cemeteries.” No-

the street-system. Hampton Court maze
is simple in comparison now that the
suburbs and the tall timber are grow-

Eddie Ward, in one of his gloomiest
moods, pictured Australia last week as
a wretched territory hag-ridden by grasp-
ing monopoly and a “great press . . .
under control of anti-Labor interests
determined to set up a dictatorship to
prevent the people hearing Labor’s case.”
Shades of McGirr and of the Miners’
Federation, which during the war called
for the censorship of criticism on the
Labor movement!

“Collins Street”: During the Melbourne
beer-dispute, when some hotel-keepers
were refused beer-supplies by the
breweries, leading citizens received in-
vitations from Reg Fogarty, general-
manager of Carlton and United Brewery,
assuring them he intended to turn it on,
but he was referring to the new South
Gate fountain, adjacent to Princes
Bridge, which he was opening as chair-
man of the City Development Associa-
tion. When the big moment arrived
and he turned it on, there was a fine
head of froth. Some miscreant had
planted detergent in the fountain.


Personal
ITEMS
Landed in Hobart to take office as
the Speck’s new Governor, Thomas
Godfrey Poison Corbett, second Baron
Rowallan, was formerly Chief Scout
of the British Commonwealth. He’s
a K.T. and a K.8.E., and he also won
the M.C. in War I, when he served with
the Grenadier Guards and later with
the Ayrshire Yeomanry. In War II he
commanded a battalion of the Royal
Scots Fusiliers, retiring in 1944. A
practical farmer at his family-seat near
Kilmarnock (Scotland), he was able to
attend the Hobart Royal Show the day
after his arrival and had some shrewd
comments to make as he handed-out
awards for the beef-cattle and dairy-
cattle classes.
• •
“Sly Mongoose”: Many years ago,
serving as Staff Officer of Local Forces
in the West Indian island of Barbados,
I had to discuss some matters of duty
with a young M.C.P. —the only man of
color in the two Houses, with a fine
reputation as scholar and lawyer (and
a former member of the Barbados
Cricket XI into the bargain). '"Also,
Grantley Adams had a reputation for
being a bit of a firebrand ; but, for my
part, I found him all out to help—found
him, as well, a man who had obviously
dedicated his life to his people. Since
then great things have happened, and
the tide o‘f events has swept Sir Grantley
Adams to the prominence that dedication
deserved. When the West Indies Federa-
tion was formed he became its first
Prime Minister, in which role he is at
present visiting Australia.
• •
Sir Arthur Campbell Rymill, former
Lord .Mayor, ought to be a useful mem-
ber of the Adelaide Festival of Arts
board of governors, which looks after
the money - bags: as chairman of the
Bank of Adelaide he keeps what you
might call a remote-control eye on
money every day. He’s also a lawyer
and an M.L.C. —an aristocratic-looking
character, who hits hard in defence of
individual rights in Parliamentary
debates.
Before War II he was a name in speed-
boat-racing and polo, and also played
some cricket. He drove Tortoise II to
victory in the Australian speedboat
championships in 1933, and the next
year was at her wheel when, doing a
nice 70 in Adelaide’s Outer Harbor, she
went under and put him in the drink.
At polo he represented S.A. in Sydney’s
Gold Cup tournament in 1938 and in
Adelaide’s in 1951. Joining -up as a
gunner in the 2/7th Field Regiment, he
finished War II with a commission. He
was elected Lord Mayor in 1950 (then
42), and was knighted in 1954.
Herewith, Leo Sterling, 86 and still
going strong —a trouper of the old school,
who, although for all practical purposed
retired, lately reappeared to do an act
on TV.
Born in England and always fond of
music, Sterling recalls how, when he
was at school, he performed for Queen
Victoria. He ran away from home at
14 and joined a troupe of travelling
WANDERING MINSTREL
minstrels, who used to play one night
only in each town. Then, in 1903, he
got his first lift, at the Palace Theatre,
London, after which he and his wife
Addie formed a stage-partnership
(Sterling and Love), playing in most
principal theatres in England and abroad,
including those of Fuller’s and J. C.
Williamson’s in Australia.
When his wife’s voice failed, Sterling
carried on alone, entertaining audiences
as a wandering minstrel with two coach-
horns, a trumpet and a one-stringed fiddle.
He and his wife settled here 40 years
back and now live in Sydney, where they
are near their married daughter, grand-
children and great-grandchildren. Leo
Sterling views modern progress with
philosophic detachment. “Now, at 86,” he
says, “I can look back from electricity
to gaslight, radio to gramophones, talkies
to ‘flickers’; who knows but I may not
finish-up shaking hands with the Man
in the Moon?”
Lately welcomed in Melbourne, Com-
mander Jan Moll arrived for the 25th
anniversary of the London-Melbourne
Air Race of 1934. That year, with
Parmentier as co-pilot, he won the
handicap-section and finished second in
the speed-test, after a sensationally spec-
tacular moment or two when Albury
(N.S.W.) turned-on many of its car-
headlights to enable his KLM DC2
to make an emergency landing. He paid
a courtesy-call at Albury on the way to
Melbourne about 25,000 of his total of
29,000 flying-hours later, and found the
border city still without an airfield.
Moll is now an adviser to K.L.M.,
and his visit also marks the company’s
40th anniversary. He had been flying
for more than 30 years when he retired
in 1955.

Another Australian serving in the
R.A.F. is Air-Vice-Marshal John Forde
Hobler, A.0.C., No. 25 Group, Flying
Training Command, at Manby (Eng.).
Born and educated in Rockhampton
(Q.), he passed the solicitors’ final exam,
before going to Point Cook. After
graduation he was given a commission
in the R.A.F. and has served ever since,
winning a C.B.E. and “mention” in War
II and being in charge of administration,
Middle East Air Force, Cyprus, during-
the Suez affair (afterwards he was made
a G. 8.). Accompanied by his wife, he
was lately back in Australia on a short
visit.

Appointed assistant information-officer
to the Queen, William Heseltine has been
private-secretary to Prime Minister
Menzies since 1955. Now 30, son of a
Yorkshireman who migrated to Aus-
tralia 50 years ago, he spent his early
life in a two-roomed schoolhouse at
Wyalkatchem (W.A.), where his father
was the teacher. His own education was
State school and Christ Church Grammar
(Perth), thence to graduate at the
Westralian University. He takes-up his
new post on February 1.

Arriving last week on a State visit to
Australia, Tengku Abdul Rahman,
Prime Minister of Malaya, brought with
him a pleasantly nonchalant approach
to life. Seventh son of the Sultan of
Kedah (most attractive of all the States
of Malaya), he began early thoroughly
enjoying himself, but meanwhile work-
ing as district-officer in the civil service,
plodding through the kampongs and
getting to know what makes people tick.
Like other famous P.M.s, he read law,
but with a difference only scraping
through his finals (fourth attempt) at
the age of 45 and, while doing so,
building-up the enviable record of 28
traffic-offences in England.
That may explain why the Tengku
has won the confidence of his people in
the Federation of Malaya but still re-
tains a strong association with the
British Commonwealth, as well as having
earned the hearty respect of ordinary
blokes who recognise gameness however
it comes. Chin Peng, head of the


Malayan Communist terrorists and
toughest of nuts, found he’d met his
match when Abdul Rahman set about
talking statesmanship. It can, however,
be reported with some relief that the
Tengku still prefers to talk about sports-
cars.

Queensland’s new acting Deputy
Surveyor-General, Norwegian-born T.
Hein, has camped on every major
Queensland river during his years of
peering through a theodolite. He came
to Australia as an infant in arms, joined
the public service in 1929 after six years’
private practice, and became senior staff
surveyor of the Surveyor - General’s
Department. A Fellow of the Australian
Institute of Surveyors and a member of
Queensland's Examining Surveyors’
Board, he surveyed Innisfail soldier-
settlements after World War 11.

A civil servant with one of the worth-
while jobs, Harold Greve Strom retired
last week as divisional engineer for
rivers and streams in the Victorian Water
Commission. He was 38 years with the
commission, and he found the Hunter
(N.S.W.) a most fascinating river.
He has been called in for consultation
with the rivers-experts in N.S.W.
Queensland and New Guinea, as one
of the nation’s greatest authorities on
river-improvement works, on which he
has written several books. He has been
advising about 15 river-improvement
trusts in Victoria in recent years ; earlier
there was no money for river-improve-
ment. He told The Bulletin that he
learned a lot in New Zealand, where a
great job has been done, but the tech-

“D.G.C.”: Frank H. Brewster, who
has passed on at Bellingen (N.S.W.), did
some great work with the JST.S.W. Water
Conservation and Irrigation Commis-
sion, first as engineer, later as a com-
missioner. Back in 1911 he was on the
irrigation project which resulted in the
growth of Leeton and Griffith (N.S.W.),
Renmark (S.A.) and, to a degree,
Deniliquin (N.S.W.). Later he had a
hand in the planning which led to the
Snowy River Scheme, and he became
chairman of the Hunter River Scheme.
A lake near Condobolin (N.S.W.) was
named after him. His comrades, though,
would remember him best as the most
human and entertaining of companions
—one who made life seem good when
they were living under canvas on the dry,
dusty, windswept plains, which were
later to be transformed by the work they
did then.

Graham Jennings, 31-year-old presi-
dent of Melbourne Junior Chamber of
Commerce, certainly gets around on
behalf of the younger businessmen.
Joining the organisation in 1954, he has
since attended four State conferences
and three national conventions as the
Melbourne delegate, and was Australian
delegate at the World Congress of Junior
Chamber International at Wellington
(N.Z.) in 1956. Now he’s off to attend
a similar World Congress in Rio
Janeiro.
Jennings is senior interviewer and
investigating officer of the industrial-
finance department of the Common-
wealth Bank, and it was during his term
of office that the junior chamber
launched its campaign for jobs for the
physically handicapped. When he isn’t
working for the bank or the junior
chamber (or attending conferences), he
gets in a round of golf.

Five years ago Clive Perry Hildebrand,
Queensland’s 1960 Rhodes Scholar, was
advised by Sir John Laverack (then
Governor of Queensland) to set his
sights specially on that particular honor.
Then 17, Hildebrand wds receiving a
prize from the late Sir John at a Bris-
bane Grammar speech-night at the time,
but it wasn’t until the final year of his
mining - engineering degree - course at
Queensland University that he finally
decided to take the advice. He will
read for a degree in philosophy, politics
and economics at Oxford.
Queensland’s last Rhodes Scholar,
Tom Baxter, also came from Brisbane
Grammar and like Hildebrand was a
first-rate Rugby Union player. Both
captained the B.G.S. XV and Hildebrand
also represented the school at swimming,
cricket and athletics, and was fullback
for Queensland Uni. and Brisbane R.U.
teams.
In 1948 the late David Martin, casting-
about in London for acts for a new
Tivoli show, snapped-up an adagio-
dancing trio appearing at the Palladium
—the Hungarian-born Rudas family:
TIBOR RUDAS
Tibor (sketched herewith), his wife and
brother. They came on a 10-weeks’
contract, have stayed on ever since, and
are now naturalised Australians. Before
going to England Tibor had been official
choreographer to the Budapest State
Operetta, and, after visits to the Far
East and South-east Asia, he realised
there was an export-trade future for
Australian variety talent. At present he
has 73 Australians in seven shows “on
the road,” from New Delhi to Hong
Kong and from Bangkok to Tokyo. He
is able to mix Orientals and Occidentals
into a smooth-running show-family here
as well, as he’s demonstrating in his

In London, at 54, James (“Jimmy”) Mollison,
who broke two records on flights between
Australia and England. His first wife, Amy

in an air-crash in 1941.
At Luang Prabang, at 74, King Sisavang

ABORIONALITIES
Peter Nicolson: The Orient liner
Ophir (B. 21/10/’59), which brought the
then Duke and Duchess of York to Aus-
tralia in 1901, ended her 31 years of
service in the shipbreaker’s yard in 1922.
Six years later another Ophir, a some-
what smaller passenger - ship than the
Orient liner, was completed in Amster-
dam for the K.P.M. Line’s Netherlands
East Indies services. This Dutch ship
was- without doubt what “Mugga Way”
saw at Palembang, and she not only
survived the war but was still running
in that company’s service at the begin-
ning of this year. Here they are in

Ophir below.

“Khyber”: Mention of “Pommy” by
“Duke” Tritton, and its suggested
origin, brings to mind that my grand-
father, of Breton origin, born Braidwood,
N.S.W., 1850, died 1913, used the term
during the whole of his life when re-
ferring to a particularly tough citizen.
Pomme, he said, pronounced “pommy,”
as distinct from pomme, pronounced
“pom” (apple), was current in France for
centuries when referring to hard traders,
and was applied to the English in par-
ticular. Napoleon, in one of his speeches,
classed the British as “ Boutiquiers
pommes” (hard-headed shopkeepers).

“Q. Ree”: We have just had our
two-days annual sports - meeting, and
one of the attractions was the Vitivou
“Games not what it used to be , Juan!”
(“New Fiji”) Marching Girls, lovely-
looking girls, with nice figures and strong,
beautiful legs. Their golden blouses
and short little skirts (made of material
in a masi cloth pattern) looked lovely
against their dark brown skins. As they
marched, their swinging arms flung their
skirts up so that all their legs could be
seen. The European men (and the
Fijian too, I daresay) enjoyed this im-
mensely. But the Fijian women behind
me were scandalised. I couldn’t under-
stand a word they said, but the tone was
enough.

“Keima”: I know that Goonoo
Goonoo (which was mentioned on the
cover of The Bulletin’s latest Wool
Issue) is pronounced Gunni G’noo, and
that Mogil Mogil is pronounced Mo-g’l
(accent on first syllable) M’gill (accent
on second). But can anyone enlighten
me on the correct pronunciation of the
name of a little creek, Bow Bowing,
which runs under the railway-line south
of Campbelltown (N.S.W.)? Is it Bo
80-ing Creek (“o’s” as in “go”), Bow
Bowing Creek (“ow’s” as in “bowwow”),
Bo Bowing Creek, or yet Bow 80-ing
Creek?

“Oldomo”: A real bushwhacker, living
far out in the bush, only going to town
for a few hours every two or three
months, I’ve been puzzled for years to
know what the stuff was that women,
old and young, plastered on their faces.
Now, in a window of a general store,

agers —All Use ’s Paving Paint.”

“Kesem”: An uncle of Colin Basil
Peter Bell (B. 14/10/’59) was “Joey”
Bell, Minister for Lands in pre-Kaiser-
war days in Queensland. He was mainly
responsible for encouraging new people
to the State by advertisements in southern
provincial papers, also by appointing
agents —all setting-out the advantages of
cheaper land in south-west Q. Hundreds
and hundreds of land-hungry men made
their way north some families by
boat and train; others overland in
buggies, sulkies or wagons; two
young men “walked their heifers from
Wagga.” Station - properties, the leases
of which had expired or were forfeited
by drought-hit owners, had the makings
of good farms, especially near the rail-
way lines where water in fair years
wasn’t a difficulty, and small acreages
were surveyed and ready for prospects
SPIRITUS FERMENTI
We were standing drinking beer
When he started acting queer,
Kept on calling for another double gin.
There was nothing wrong with that
Save the very funny fact
’Twas his pocket that he poured the
liquor in.
Soon the bar-room noise was hushed,
Bill the barman’s face grew flushed
And the atmosphere grew very, very
tense;
Then Bill tapped him on the sleeve
Asked him nicely would he leave —
To this the stranger seemed to take
offence.
He took up a fighting stance,
Gave a skip and hitched his pants,
Challenged Bill come on and see what he
could do.
Then it seemed that there d be a stoush,
Till, surprisingly, a mouse
From his pocket poked its head up into
view.
Poor Bill he was surprised
As it looked him in the eyes,
Saying in a slurry voice but grim,
“Hie —/ don’t know where I’m at
But bring out your flaming cat,
I’ll damn soon tear the daylight out of
him !’’
Well, it only goes to show
That you never, ever know
The things they put in alcohol today,
But if you should meet a cat,
Give the poor old thing a pat;
It could be the one that lost, and ran
away.

tion (an increase of nearly 3000), but
the really spectacular increase was in

manufacturing, building and construc-
tion, land-, sea- and air-transport, com-
munications, commerce, personal service,
hotels and cafes. In these varied jobs
more than 17,500 natives are now em-
ployed—up 15 per cent. One significant
decrease was in mining—a fall of almost
21 per cent, to 2400.

“Ceg”: Those galahs tearing up
the newly - germinated wheat (B.
14/10/’59) were not looking for a drink,
but for sugar. Nature, the chemist, turns
the starch in sown grain into sugar, then
into cellulose in the sequence of build-
ing the solid framework of plants. This
turning into sugar upon germination of
grain is, of course, the principle of
malting ; unlike the birds, humans prefer
to wait until the hops are added.

“Pieter Nuyts”: Over the last 25 years
one of the most hunted things in W.A.
has been half-an-inch of tawny-colored
insectry with erect hairs on its body and
a powerful sting to its tail. Being just
an ant, it probably rejoices in the name
Nothomyrmecia macrops, not knowing
that the notho prefix means bastard.
Only two members of this species have
ever been captured, and that occurred
nearly 30 years ago, when a party of
naturalists were collecting in the dry
country east and inland from Israelite
Bay, on the south coast near the Bight.
From these two specimens, which weren’t
examined closely until a few years after
collecting, scientists conclude that Notho-
myrmex is the most primitive ant known,
and that includes ants known only by
their fossil-remains. It’s older even than
Lithomyrmex glauerti, which is only
about a quarter-inch long and hails from
the Irwin River country near Geraldton.
That species was formerly considered the
most ancient form of ant still living—
it has wings like some of the most primi-
tive fossil-forms ; but Notho is even
more primitive. He looks a bit like the
bull-ant, but with broader jaws, and, like
the bull-ant, he has an extra tooth on his
claws, which a_re adapted for climbing
trees.
“Avice”: A “birdie” scored by Nhill
(Vic.) golfer Charlie Roberts in a Legacy
tournament is unique in that he still has
living proof of it. The roseila-parrot
that copped his ball on the fairway while
both were in mid-flight recovered, and
is now fraternising in his aviary with
his budgerigars.
* * * *
“Sebak”: “F.E.L.’s” explanation of
the distinction between being punched
on the jaw or in the kidneys (B.
21/10/’59) loses on a technical k.-o.
The eye could scarcely be classed among
the “more unobtrusive parts of the body,
such as the kidneys, liver, solar-plexus,
etc.,” but you get walloped in it, not on
it. And how about the ear? It must be
numbered with “the projecting parts”
(nose, jaw, etc.), but for some untraceable
reason we are seldom threatened with a
thump on it nor in it; it is always a
clump under or over it. I’ve known only
one nonconformist to the accepted
placings. His threat was invariably
“aside the ear’ole.”
# * * *
“Sevenelms”: River-redgum ( Euc.
rostrata ) is being recommended by the
C.5.1.R.0. as a good - quality flooring-
timber —and about time, too. Attrac-
tively grained and durable, its ready
sale in air-dried or unseasoned form for
building has kept sawmillers from
exploring the flooring-market, in which
field success will be messed with quarter-
cutting and kiln-drying. By an ex-
saw miller who sleeps in a redgum bed,
complemented by a redgum lowboy and
all floors of this same roseate wood, let
aspirants for these amenities be warned
to lend a deaf ear to any timber-
merchant hinting that air-dried and back-
sawn is “just as good” or they will have
floors in their second summer made to
look second-grade by the cracks between
boards.
• • * •
“Parah”: Joe was asleep in the sun
when I almost stepped on him. A swipe
with the bar I was carrying merely
galvanised him into furious life, the
result of which was a neat knot round
the stem of a bracken-fern. “Mad as a
snake”—l had never appreciated that
saying till Joe then savaged the nearest
living object, which happened to be the
coils of his own latter-end; suddenly
he realised the implications of his pre-
dicament and went into reverse, untying
the knot and shooting-off into the thick
bracken.

Rucko, the local soak in this New
Guinea neck of the woods, has the
knack of putting his head down and
sleeping whenever and wherever his
intake of beer has benumbed his senses.
Once he slept on the snooker-table and,
on awakening, thought he had kidney-
pains until he found he had been lying
on a snooker-ball. Another time a
horrified matron rushed off to report a
drowned body, which proved to be
Rucko floating in the swimming-pool,
flaked-out, but very much alive judging
by his comments on being awakened. But
a recent experience nearly put Rucko on
lollywater. He awoke about 4 a.m. with
just enough starlight to see that he was
lying under somebody’s house. That was
bad enough, because if he made any noise
trying to scramble out the irate house-
holder might take a shot at him, justi-
fiably thinking it was someone trying to
break-in. More alarming was that Rucko
had a snoring-companion. “Shut up,
mug!” he breathed. So passed an agoni-
sing couple of hours, Rucko stiff,
cramped and afraid to move, anxiously
beseeching silence of his fellow-snorer.
Daylight showed that he was under an
empty office-building—and the snorer
was Mrs. B’s pet-poodle. —“Casca.”

The Weakening-off
'T'he weakening-off which has
been a feature of Aus-
tralian sharemarkets for the
past two or three weeks was
overdue, and it should be a
good thing for the market
generally. It has not been a
sharp reverse, but it was
enough to make the more im-
petuous and inexperienced
market-operators pause and do
a little thinking in investment
terms rather than just blindly
following market “tone”.
The particular factor which
prompted the reversal in the
market is hard to determine,
but it did happen to coincide
with the return of the Mac-
millan Government in the
United Kingdom, and there
had been suggestions, from ex-
perienced quarters that con-
tinuance of a Conservative
Administration in the U.K.
might promote a repatriation
of politically nervous invest-
ment-capital back to the United
Kingdom.
It so happens that the Old
Country is talking in pretty
confident economic terms at the
moment also.
It seems now to be certain
that the buying of shares in
Australia on a favorable tax
basis by U.K. residents was the
thing which really put the zip

Production Tempo
Treasury Information
-*■ Bulletin figures for the
three months to August 31
show a fairly steady increase
in the output of most essential
industrial products, all basic
materials being in increased
demand with the exception of
black coal and metallurgical
coke. The lift in pig-iron and
steel has been over 15 p.c. com-
pared with the same period of
last year.
Electricity output rose 8.3
p.c. “Consume r-durables”
varied, with sharp falls in
radios and radiograms; but
textiles showed a welcome lift.
With the exception of super-
phosphate, which has been
affected by seasonal and other
conditions in the pastoral
industry, demand for most
things averaged about 5 p.c.
higher.
Output of building-materials
was up generally, and, in keep-
ing with increased homebuild-
ing, the demand for floor-
coverings—carpets, lino., etc. —
continued to grow, with a lift
of 17.6 p.c. for the three
months.
Against a bewildering and
illusory background of soar-
ing industrial - share prices
it is good to see at least some
real progress in national pro-
ductivity, even if it does not
measure-up to the great
immediate expectations of the
market.
Metals—and Commodities
in the price of
A copper, and recovery in
the prices of some other metals,
has raised queries among
market-watchers as to whether
these things presage a further
improvement in the price of
wool, wheat and commodities
generally.
In the days before World
War II metal-prices (including
the price of gold, of course)
were the bell-wethers that indi-
cated the trend of other prices.
It is a fact, too, that a slump
in the price of base metals
preceded the heavy fall in wool
prices during the 1958-59
season.
In studying present pros-
pects, the first thing to decide
is whether the recent jump-
up in the price of copper is
a genuine long-term market
trend, or merely a flasb-in-the-
pan generated by stockpiling
policy in the U.S.A.
The second thing to consider
is the statistical position of
other metals and other com-
modities. *
Some of these don’t show-up
so well from a “bull” point of
view, especially wheat.
But wool seems to be more
favorably placed.
Tulloch Disappointment
"VLt another disappointment
has come from that affluent
rolling-stock builder, garden-
tool manufacturer, engineer
and boilermaker Tulloch, Ltd.
(Rhodes, Sydney). For years
investors have eyed the huge
pile of reserves and high earn-
ing-power and opined that
“something must come out of
it” before long. But although
the dividend was steady at
20 p.c. between 1951-52 and
1957-58, there was no bonus-
issue, and, when a cash issue
was announced in May this
year, the 714,308 ss. ords.
were offered at a 2s. 6d. (50
p.c.) premium.
Now, for the year to June
30 last, on a reduced profit
and on a capital increased by
the acquisition of Trojan, Ltd.
(makers of garden-tools, etc.),
the final div. has been cut to
7| p.c., making 174 p.c. for
the year. The shares have
dipped from 20s. to 17s. 6d. as a
result.
As an investment, there has
been something inscrutable
about Tullochs for many years.
Some market-supporters think
it time the directors called a
spade a spade.
Better Times for Textiles
TX7hereas all sections of the
’ ’ textile industry suffered a
setback during the financial
year 1958-59, during the three
months to the end of August
the Commonwealth Statisti-
cian’s figures show improve-
ment in all departments com-
pared with the same period in
1958.

One reason for the improve-

been the fact that the 1959

The reason for the recovery

Mt. Lyell Reconstruction
TAetails of the Mt. Lyell new
issues forecast at the annual
meeting have been disclosed as
a one-for-four bonus-issue and
a one-for-two cash issue at
par, the ratios being in respect
of the present capital of
£2,325,000.
Over the past month the £1
shares have steadily strength-
ened from 355. to 535.
The chairman has said that
no separation of the mine from
the co.’s investment-portfolio
is contemplated at present,
though it has been considered.
The bonus-issue will come
from the co.’s extensive invest-
ment-portfolio, which was con-
sidered at length in B.
30/9/'59. The cash is required
for “various mining projects.”
GATT
"W/Bat goes qn at the
fifteenth general assembly
of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
being held in Tokyo is not
clear to Australians up to now,
and probably never will be—
partly because of inadequate
cabling, but largely because of
the “closed” nature of the dis-
cussions.
Australia's import-restriction
policy has been criticised ; on
what precise grounds is not yet
clear. But it is obvious that
criticism of trade-restriction to
protect foreign - exchange
reserves can only be justified
where there has been favoritism
or victimisation of particular
countries within the overall
operation of the restrictions.
A country which finds its
foreign - currency reserves
running-down has the alterna-
tives of restricting imports by
legislation or by depreciating its
currency. And it can’t follow
the latter course without
approval of another interna-
tional body—the International
Monetary Fund (provided, of
course, that the embarrassed
country is a member of the
Fund).
Thangoo
[From Li. Owen]
T-'he site of Thangoo No. 1
1 well, which was decided
upon at the regular September
meeting in New York of repre-
sentatives of the four Wapet
partners, is of considerable
interest to all who follow the
exploration for oil in Australia.
In particular, it indicates how
the search in the Canning
Basin has narrowed.
The location lies about
50 miles s.-e. of Broome, and
falls, therefore, some distance
south of the triangle defined
by the Roebuck Bay bore
(over 20 miles s.-e. of Broome),
the Dampier Downs bore
(approximately 60 miles e.-s.-e.
of Broome) and the Goldwyer
bore (approximately 30 miles
s.-s.-e. of Broome).
At Roebuck Bay the beds,
for the upper 500 ft. of the bore,
were doubtfully of lower
Cretaceous age, and were
separated by what was taken
to be a disconformity from
underlying strata of upper (and
doubtful middle) Jurassic
which persisted for about
1567 ft. until they were bot-
tomed by an angular uncon-
formity. The underlying
Permian beds themselves
broken by at least two dis-
conformities continued for
about 1787 ft. when a break
(which has been attributed,
variously, to either a discon-
formity or an unconformity)
was met at a depth of 3354 ft.,
where the drill passed into
what is now named “Thangoo
calcarenite,” possibly of Ordo-
vician. age, which persisted for
306 ft. Below this, in apparent
conformity, what has now been
christened “Roebuck dolomite”
was encountered and was
drilled into for 350 ft. Cuttings
yielded fossils, determined as
of probable lower Ordovician

The Roebuck dolomite was

Downs bore between 2625 ft.
an< 3 3028 ft., but here the
Thangoo calcarenite was not
recorded, although the two
bores are distant only about
40 miles.
The above-recorded facts
point to considerable tectonic
activity during the Ordovician
in this area, and the recovery
of “frosted” conodonts from
these bores strengthens this
assumption. It is a pity that

undertaken in these bores, as
it might have cleared-up much
of the uncertainty which still
remains as to the structural and
tectonic, details.
The Goldwyer bore —in con-
tradiction to the geophysical
forecast of 6000-7000 ft.
entered basement-rocks at
4575 ft. Brown oil-stains were
noted in samples of non-
porous limestone between the
depths of 2900 ft. and 4300 ft.,
but formation-tests over this
interval failed to recover any
oil or gas.
With the meagre informa-
tion available, it is premature
to speculate on the derivation
either of the oil which caused
the staining of the Goldwyer
limestone or of the “shows”
reported from other Canning
Basin wells, but the failure to
strike measurable quantities
of oil points to a deep-seated
origin.
In spite of the unexpectedly
shallow depth of basement at
Goldwyer—and of the pre-
sumed Ordovician at Roebuck
and Dampier Downs —it is to
be hoped that drilling will be
continued at Thangoo to a
conclusive depth. The known
sudden changes in the depth
and the character of the de-
posits in this area make it
dangerous to assume that only
comparatively shallow drilling
is called for. It is also to be
hoped that orientated cores will
be recovered from the Thangoo
bore.
The apparent absence of
such coring seems to have
been, in the past, the reason
for much of the uncertainty

and deep formations and for
the indecisive use of the terms

formity.”
South British Insurance
South British Insurance’s
long-awaited bonus-issue
will be one-for-one and,
coming from profits derived
before March 31, 1957, will be
treated as non - assessable
income in shareholders' hands.
Dividend for the last year has
been lifted from 22! P-c. to
25 p.c.
The directors say that it is
increasing authorised capital
from £3 million to £lO million,
subject to consent of the
Capital Issues Committee.
The board says that it is
the policy of the company, in
common with most British
insurance-cos., to relate the
amount distributed annually as
dividend tb shareholders to the
amount received by the com-
pany as interest, dividends and
rents. The proposed doubling
of the co.’s issued capital is,
therefore, in no way an indi-
cation that the total amount
distributed as dividend in
future years will exceed the
distribution of recent years,
they add.
Nevertheless, it seems safe
to expect that dividends will,
in fact, rise as underwriting
surpluses are ploughed-back
year after year and the com-
pany’s annual income from
interest, dividends and rents
increases.
At the time of the last scrip-
issue, one-for-one in 1951, the
current dividend was 27! p.c.
After the issue the rate was
cut not to 13! per cent., but
to 16f per cent. Thereafter it
moved up as follows, keeping
step approximately with a
rising income from interest and
rents: —1953, 18-f p.c.; 1954,
18| p.c.; 1955, 20 p.c.; 1956,
20 p.c.; 1957, 22! p.c.; 1958,
22! P-C. ; 1959, 25 p.c.
The present issue will double
capital to £4,126,560. Of this
amount, £4,003,830, or 97 per
cent., will have come from
scrip-issues ~ from accumulated
profits.
These issues have been: —■
1912, £200,000; 1917, £200,000;
1921, £250,000 ; 1927, £257,910;
1951, £1,031,640; 1 9 59,
£2,063,280.
N.Z, Insurance
'T'he New Zealand Insurance
Co. lost no time in follow-
ing South British with the an-
nouncement of plans for a
bonus-issue. It proposes to
give shareholders one-for-
three. The issue will come
from profits derived before
March 31, 1957, and will
therefore be treated as non-
assessable income in share-
holders’ hands.
It will increase paid capital
by £1 million to £4 million. It
will be the ninth bonus-issue
since 1913, and £3,700,000, or
92.5 per cent, of the projected
capital of £4 will have
come from reserves.
The directors have indicated
that they will pay 11 per cent,
on the adjusted capital of £4
million. Last year’s payment
was 12! per cent., plus 5 per
cent, centenary bonus. A pay-
ment of 11 per cent, on the
new capital would be equiva-
lent to 14f per cent, on the
present capital.
In the year to May 31, 1959,
the company earned a net
profit of £736,975, including
underwriting surplus, £276,566,
and interest and rents, £460,391.
The 17! per cent, distribution
took £525,000. Capital was
£3 million and stockholders’
funds £7,016,966.
Before making the coming
issue the company proposes to
lift nominal capital to £6
million.

“The Merchant of Venice”
In John Alden’s production
with the J.C.W. company at
Sydney Royal, John Laurie
started Shylock so quietly
against the breezy background
built up by the previous actors
as to haul attention forward
in its seat, and he kept it there
for the rest of the play with
a beautiful portrait of the old
usurer, neither extenuating any-
thing nor setting down aught
in malice.
Even when he whetted his
knife on his shoe he had the
quiet determination of a man
about to get his rights ; and
when he made his final exit,
stripped of daughter, money
and religion and loaded with
insults, his arm, before his face,
he had the speechless dignity
of a man ganged-up on, in a
game of poker where the rules
are varied to suit the gang.
It was Shylock from inside,
whereas Alden’s Shylock, the
following night, was from the
outside—a producer’s Shylock,
with a lisp added, more stri-
dency, a hundred details from
a life of thinking about the
part; but not the firm, inevit-
able line that gave you a man.
For anyone apt to think of
Portia as what the Eliza-
bethans called bona roba —the
glorious, well-fleshed creatures
of Coryat’s tour of Italy—
Elaine Montgomerie’s Portia
was rather like the After in the
advertisements for reducing-
pills. No one ever glided more
smoothly in a long dress onto
the Royal stage than Miss
Montgomerie in her first
appearance, or dealt with
suitors with more grace and
dignity; but at the mention
of Bassanio’s name she was
almost as unrestrained as a
Sinatra fan ; Portia, one felt,
had more weight than that.
Yet in the trial-scene this
lightness gave an impishness to
her masquerade as a lawyer,
and a wiry strength to her
arguments, curiously character-
istic of young wives who work
in offices today—an efficient
Portia is maybe a necessity
to our times —and in the moon-
light, when she was teasing
Bassanio over the loss of her
ring, she was charming.
Terry McDermott made a
noble Prince of Morocco. And
as the other suitor, the Prince
of Arragon, Anthony Bazell
filled to overflowing Shaks-
peare’s frame for an outrageous
“This is his ‘ blue ’ period
fop ; his clothes were gorgeous,
as were all the clothes. Some
of the set scenes, with Portia
and Nerissa (Mavis Turner)
and musicians playing lutes,
were reminiscent of Watteau.
But if there is a secret key
to Shakspeare’s comics—as
McKern had with Touchstone,
and Laurie with Autolycus—
John Craig and William Austin
didn’t find it for Launcelot
Gobbo and his father. Actors
of comic parts so often forget
that the man who seems funny
to others is serious to himself.
John Unicomb had amusing
moments as Gratiano;
Leonard Bullen (Antonio),
Malcolm Billings (Bassanio)
and Edward Brayshaw
(Lorenzo) wore their parts with
that inconspicuousness which is
the mark of a gentleman ; and
Fernand Glyn was appro-
priately shy and bewildered as
Jessica.
Altogether, it was a first-
rate Shakspearian production
with fidelity to the play
enlivened by original thinking
about the playing, and the
single setting of the well-known
Alden manner enriched by the
well-known J.C.W. magnifi-
cence —a production to be
remembered in any later con-
sideration of “The Merchant.”

Clifton Pugh
Clifton Pugh, whose vivid
and striking oils are at Sydney
Macquarie Galleries, is one of
a distinctive group of painters
of Australiana who, whether
or not they are directly in-
fluencing each other, are
obviously working on similar
lines: Drysdale and Nolan in
Sydney; Arthur Boyd, John
Perceval and Pugh in Mel-
bourne ; and, latterly, Jon
Molvig in Queensland.
Forgetting the individual
differences, which are consider-
able, what they are all broadly
trying to do is to make a fresh
approach to the Australian
scene by using all the freedom
which contemporary ideas and
devices have made available to
them. What is sinister in
Pugh’s paintings (the crows and
the bones) comes from sur-
realism ; what is dramatic, the
striking patterns and vivid
contrasting colors blacks
against reds comes from
abstraction. But both also
come from Australia.
Whether or not the painters
realise it, they are doing much
the same thing as Streeton
and Tom Roberts did in their
day ; for theirs, too, was the
application of.the latest Euro-
pean ideas and techniques to
the Australian scene. But the
advantage of this new approach
is that the painters are not
merely repeating the Streeton
landscape: they are coming
at the problem freshly. It
is a way of seeing a few things
that the earlier painters missed
or could not, within the limits
of Impressionism, encompass.
It seems in this age an in-
evitable and an admirable thing
to do. The danger, of course,
is in missing the earlier solidity
of technique and fidelity of
observation ; the profit is that
the painters are able on the
one hand to avoid the essential
barrenness of abstraction, and
on the other hand to perceive
new patterns in the landscape,
and to people it with men and
animals observed not realisti-
cally but symbolically and
poetically. Pugh’s groups of
crows are stylised and re-
arranged, but they convey more
of the sinister, demonic quality
of crows than you could ever
get in a realistic approach.
One other danger, of course,
is that this new movement will
also settle into a convention,
if it has not already done so:
and it must be said that bones,
at least, have already been done
to death. It took a more tradi-
tional painter, Max Ragless, to
discover, at the latest Royal
Art Society exhibition in

Sydney, that there was some-
thing different from the car-
casses of cattle to paint in the
outback —the mirage.
Apart from the bones, Pugh
does give some evidence in this
exhibition of settling into a
convention. In one of the
paintings, “Debris,” the
straggly, ghostly trees are very
much like Arthur Boyd’s ; in
the more ambitious designs,
such as “The Rite of Spring”
and “The Eagle and the Cat,”
he repeats, essentially, the
dramatisations of his own
previous exhibition in Sydney.
But “Landscape,” with its
black cattle dramatised against
the pale background, is a fresh
and most effective discovery ;
and, as before, he demonstrates
at once his fidelity of observa-
tion and his technical sound-
ness in more direct landscapes
which, without stridence, still
make a fresh and original
approach. A painter who can
observe the green lichens on
the dead trees in “Wattles,”
who can get the richness of
massed bush in “Rocks and
Stumps” and the space of a
bushy hillside in “Rocks in the
Bush” is surely worth watching.

Early Sydney
The current show at the
Clune Galleries, Sydney, gives
you a statement about Sydney
(occasionally early Sydney)
both unimaginative and re-
stricted. Chiefly this seems to
be because the material on
display refers not to one fairly
specific historical period but
wanders indeterminately from
painter to painter in the present
day.
Why, then, is the show called
“Early Sydney”? One or two
paintings prettily show ancient
aspects (old warehouses, an old
house, old council-chambers,
etc.), but there is nothing
approaching the breadth and
meticulous solidity of, say, a
Martens scene of Port Jack-
son.
In watercolors, G. Pratt’s
“Old Woolloomooloo Wall” is
outstanding in quiet, cool
observation, and most pleasant
in its contrast of light and
shade and in the glimpse of
modern flats above the old
wall; and Cedric Flower has
a delicate and spidery “Sydney
Terrace.”
In oils, the most striking is
Leonard Hessing’s abstract
“Tempe Tip,” which, although
more like a disjointed survey-
map than a rubbish-tip, is a
nicely handled bit of composi-
tion, and attractive in a disturb-
ing sort of way.
After a while Sali Herman’s
part - abstract “Paddington
Ruins” begins to grow on you:
he has a foreground of
crumbling ruins and a row of
tenement-tops sitting against
a khaki sky. The street in
George Lawrence’s “Street
Corner, Redfern” is shining
and wet; and Jack Chandler’s
glaucous “Excavation For
Opera” suggests that the sooner
they stick a building on the
site the better.
Royal Show Art Prizes
Three art-competitions with
prizes totalling £l7OO will be
held at the 1960 Royal Easter
Show. The competitions will
be for industrial and rural sub-
jects, with separate sections for
“traditional” and “modern”
rural paintings. Entries close
March 16, 1960. Details from
the R.A.S., 33 Macquarie
Place, Sydney.
Four young students —Ken
Done, Felicity Ellison, Rosa-
lind Fry and Vanessa Mason
—are exhibiting commercial
graphic art in David Jones’
Walk Gallery, Sydney. There
is not much the critic can say
about a drawing of a pair of
shoes, except that it is a nice
drawing of a pair of shoes,
but some of the book-jackets
and illustrations to plays and
poems are quite fetching.
Films
“The Blue Angel”
In the old Heinrich Mann
story —the first film-version of
which some years ago starred
Marlene Dietrich as the siren—
the premise is that nobody can
be quite so unworldly
as a middle-aged bachelor-
professor. This German one
is certainly a prize exhibit,
falling so heavily' for a night-
club floozy that, despite her
frank warning that she’ll dump
him when the need for a change
of males prompts her, he goes
right ahead and marries her.
Then follows loss of job,
gradual decline, and final
degradation when he is forced
to act as a clown in front of
an audience of his former
academic colleagues. In the
old version he hit rock-bottom
and, logically, stayed there;
this time the rosy promise of
regeneration is held out, and
it weakens the final effect.
Such conviction as the
melodrama might spark de-
pends primarily on the role of
the prof., and here the director
is excellently assisted by Curt
Jurgens, who limns with deft
touches the little idiosyncrasies
that a bachelor-professor lead-
ing a narrow, humdrum,
sheltered life might be expected
to acquire, and persuasively
manages the transformation
from painful shyness to
pathetically fatuous amorous-
ness.
May Britt, as the amoral
lady, mixes with uninhibited
voluptuousness a touch of half-
humorous whimsy and an l-
almost-hate-to-do-this air.

“The Man Upstairs”
Here is a pungent comment,
developed with some well-
managed tension, on an aspect
of life peculiar to an age in
which nervous stress can
often be turned into a public
danger.
A promising young scientist
living in a residential, his
nerves shredded by overwork
and a wrecked love-affair, im-
patiently hits a fellow-resident
in a slight tiff, breaking his
glasses.
This old-womanish character
hysterically rings the police,
claiming assault. When the
police arrive the scientist
pushes an aggressive sergeant,
who goes over a balcony and
is seriously hurt; whereupon
an unimaginative inspector,
immediately branding the
scientist as a thug of the worst
type, brings up searchlights,
tear-gas, threats, fire-ladders,
and a lot of ironmongery, all
of which do no more than turn
an ordinarily harmless fellow
into one so fear- and panic-
stricken that he could at any
tick turn to either suicide or
homicide. It is left to a young
married woman to avert a
tragedy with pity, understand-
ing and good horse-sense.
As the cause of all the
rumpus, Richard Attenborough
is highly effective. Sydney
actress Dorothy Alison is also
impressive as the woman who
saves the day.

Cot<built Troxcovotors ore famous for their all-round working ability. They are
extensively employed in construction, mining, manufacturing and countless other
industries throughout the world.
There are many reasons why these machines have received such wide acceptance on so
many types of jobs. But the main reason is their ability to outproduce and outlast
similar machines of equivalent size and horsepower. Consider the superior features
incorporated into the CAT Traxcavator. Ask your W & J representative to show you
how one of these machines will fit your production requirements by doing more work,
better, and at a lower cost.

National Minerals Holdings Ltd
Chairman’s Address to Stockholders
v . • * f
at Annual General Meeting held on the 7th October, 1959.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The result of our operations for the year, as set out before you, can best be summarised as
follows by a comparison with last year.
Owing to a production cut of 20% and a further decline in Rutile prices, our
gross revenue, derived exclusively from mining operations, fell by . . . £51,274
However, our costs were reduced by . . L . _ mJ .. ..£37,232
Giving a reduction in net profit from mining operations of .. . .. . £14,042
The net profit derived from investments increased by .. .. .. £2,929
Leaving an overall decrease of 7.6% in net profit of .. .. L . £11,113
On account of the limitations on output,
our Newcastle plant operated during the year
on a five-day basis. However, recent develop-
ments affecting the Rutile market have influenced
your Directors in favour of making a major
change in policy, which will result in the plant
being operated at full capacity.
Until recently, it was felt that the supply
and demand position would come into balance
in 1960 or 1961 at the latest, thus stabilising
the market, but this now is by no means certain.
The production of Rutile in Australia for the
six months up to June, 1959, was approximately
tons, and it would now appear that from
July to December this figure will be exceeded,
thus bringing the 1959 total to approximately
the same as 1958, when our exports were
slightly below our production.
Large quantities of Rutile purchased else-
where and paid for mainly by U.S. buyers, but
not yet shipped, are now being disposed of to
our regular customers at cost. This factor, plus
over-production, must influence the market for
i 960 and 1961 at least, therefore your Directors
have decided to re-enter the market at once and
let our customers know our intentions.
Very shortly we will place in production
the largest single wet plant unit in Australia on
our huge deposits at Redhead, and it is now
50 Miller Street, North Sydney.
proposed that we increase last year’s Rutile
production by 50 per cent. This will mean a
substantial lowering of our costs, enabling us to
meet any price competition and ensure for our
customers continuity of supply of the material
they have been in the habit of purchasing for
the past ten years. The necessary plant additions
and improvements to effect this increase have
already been provided for.
Zircon, however* is still firm, but very little
advantage accrues, as it can only be at the
expense of Rutile, which must be produced
initially. Monazite, previously sold at approxi-
mately £l5O per ton, is now difficult to sell at
a reduced price, but we will continue produc-
ing it.
The carrying company, A. F. Toll Pty.
Limited, which your company acquired in July,
is located at Wickham in premises common to
our mineral treatment plant and has for many
years been closely associated with us through
the cartage of beach concentrates and mineral
products.
The acquisition will therefore be of con-
siderable benefit to our mining operations, and it
is expected will provide a substantial contribu-
tion to the profit of the group. We have secured
the services of a top transport man in Australia,
Mr. R. J. Langford, as General Manager to
control the new addition.
R. A. CROWTHER,
Chairman of Directors.

F. J. Walker, Ltd.
HThe efficient F. J. Walker group com-
prises the parent and 11 subsidiaries,
namely, Australian Chilling and Freez-
ing Co., Ltd., Australian Natural Gut
Manufacturing Co. Pty., Australian Wool
and Produce Co. Pty., Commercial
Freezing Co. Pty., Hunter River Meat
Packing Co. Pty., Metropolitan Meat Co.
Pty., Oldham Bros. Pty., R. N. Mc-
Gavin and Son Pty., Sydney Meat Pre-
serving Co. (Limited), Walker Trading
Co. Pty. and Waterside Cold Stores Pty.
The group slaughters livestock at
Auburn and Aberdeen (N.S.W.) meat-
works for local and export markets and
operates country chilling-works. The
well-integrated organisation also pro-
duces smallgoods and casings, conducts
a number of retail shops and provides
freezing and cold-storage facilities.
The co.’s sales of pre-wrapped meat,
both in chilled and frozen form, con-
tinued to expand last term. The increas-
ing trend towards establishing super-
markets in Australia should help this
line of business.
The recovery of wool prices from the
very low level of February, 1959,
improved trading conditions during the
year under review.
There was a major change in the over-
seas meat-trade as the result of variations
in the U.K. meat-agreement on Septem-
ber 30, 1958. Since then it has been
possible to ship lamb, mutton and all
but first- and second-quality beef to any
part of the world. One direct result of
this was a new U.S. market for Aus-
tralian third-grade meat (“hamburger
beef,” etc.).
Due to the relatively high prices which
American importers were offering for
Australian third-grade meat, competition
for local cattle became intense, reducing
the margins between various categories
of beef.
In spite of a record production of
meat, which rose by about 12| p.c. to
1,479,600 tons over the year, the export-
drive to U.K. and U.S., and adverse
seasonal conditions in most States, have
kept the demand on local markets at a
high level. Retailers were unable to
pass the whole impact of higher prices
to consumers and suffered severe reduc-
tions in profits.
On the whole, and in view of the
difficulties, the year ended June 30, 1959,
was satisfactory enough for the F. J.
Walker group. Turnover increased by
£1,162,000 to £8,798,000. All sections of
the group traded profitably and contri-
buted to consolidated earnings. Net
trading-profit before tax was £43,479
higher at £423,343, after providing
£65,755 (up £10,441) for depreciation and
paying £BOOO directors’ fees. Provision
for income-tax took £152,600 (up
£33,800), and was roughly correspond-
ing to current rates on published earnings.
After setting aside £232 for minority
interests, consolidated net profit of the
group was £270,511 (up £9870):

the year the policy of plant-modernisa-
tion was vigorously pursued, and £119,123
was spent on improvement of buildings
and capital-equipment.
Stock was £20,218 higher at £321,379,
while debtors were £53,724 up at
£384,153. Cash, bonds and investments
did not vary much at £562,926 (up
£7613).
Assets of all units within the group
are insured at replacement-values, which
considerably exceed fixed-asset values in
the balance-sheet.
At balance-date current assets exceeded
current liabilities by £712,738. This high
liquidity will be used in the co.’s new
large expansion programme, which will
require considerable capital - outlays.
Already the co. has modernised the dry.-
rendering and smallgoods units, auto-
mated the Aberdeen refrigeration-plant
and installed very low-temperature blast-
freezers at the Waterside Cold Stores.
Boning-units were established at three
undertakings.
The sharemarket, which puts its own
value on assets and earning-power, last
offered 275. 3d. for the 10s. stock-units,
making the yield 4.6 p.c., on the basis
of the steady 12£ p.c. div.-rate. Visible
net tangible assets backing worked-out
at almost 17s. 9d. a share on consolidated
figures.
The group’s stock is a solid and secure
investment made the more so by the
conservative div.-policy over the past
nine years which has enabled the co.
to finance expansion and extensive
modernisation without recourse to new
cash-issues of capital. In the end such
a policy of financing should increase the
dividend-potential, especially at the point
where heavy new capital-outlay becomes
unnecessary.
Freighters, Ltd.
Three years ago an inquiry under the
Victorian Companies Act into the
circumstances surrounding certain share-
issues made by Freighters, Ltd., led to
considerable internal dissension and,
eventually, to some drastic changes in
the composition of the co.’s board. Profit
slumped from £176,364 to £11,359 in
the 1957 term, a heavy stock write-down
contributing to the fall, as did a slip in
turnover, legal costs and various board-
and management-problems arising,
directly and indirectly, from the inquiry.

having received a 15 p.c. div. in each
of the four preceding years, the new
board indicating that the bumper profits
claimed in 1955 and 1956 would have
been reduced noticeably had stocks been
valued on a more realistic basis.
The 1958 term saw rapid recovery by
Freighters. Once out of the morass, the
co. was quick to hit top gear, profits
for the year reaching £114,823 (up
£103,464). Last year a steadier, if less
spectacular, —progress was achieved.
Profits rose £17,577 to £132,400. Evinc-
ing a return to normality, the latest
result was struck after setting aside
£58,795 (up £37,991) for tax and £41,085
(down £8602) for depreciation; it is
equivalent to an earning-rate on capital
of 14.1 p.c., as against 12.2 p.c. in 1958
and 1.1 p.c., 19.2 p.c. and 17.6 p.c. back
to 1955. Depreciation is down follow-
ing a change of policy away from actual
ownership of, to the hire and leasing of,
units comprising the co.’s vehicle-fleet.

Divs., which were withheld in 1957,
were raised to 8 p.c. {l\ p.c. in 1958)
and took £75,075. Undistributed profits
went to reserves, which augmented by
revaluation of freeholds, £13,138, and a
£39,953 profit from sale of assets,
rose £107,249 to £911,771. The p.-and-l.
account includes £20,642, being the net
amount due in settlement of writs issued
against certain past directors following
the 1956 inquiry; Three of the parties
involved have paid in full and part-pay-
ment has been received from the fourth
in accordance with the terms of settle-
ment. Preliminary investigation indicates
tax-provision well short of that required
by ruling tax-rates. It is probable, how-
ever, as was the case in the previous
term, that the disparity results from set-
off against current profits, for the pur-
poses of ascertaining tax-liability, of
losses incurred and carried forward by
subsidiaries from past years—losses not
then deductible.
General engineer and manufacturer,
Freighters handles transport, construc-
tional, refrigeration, air-conditioning and
earth-moving equipment; trailers, semi-
trailers, jinkers, heavy-duty low-loaders,
bulk-transports, petrol- and milk-tankers,
refrigerated-transport, deep-freeze plants,
rippers, ’dozers and scoops, motor-bodies
and fork-lift trucks. Group headquarters
are in Melbourne, and there are factories
in all capital cities, a small export trade
helping to swell total income.
A large part of the co.’s business is
tied-up with the fortunes of road-
hauliers, particularly the inter-State
operator, and while there is a growing
market for the co.’s specialised vehicles,
fears of excessively restrictive legislation
as well as the lack of uniform road-
regulations continue to limit oppor-
tunities for boosting sales of heavy
trailer-equipment, one of the co.’s basic
lines.
Recognising the threat to road-trans-
port in legislation designed to bolster-up
Government-owned railways, Freighters
some years ago began the manufacture
of bulk-handling containers for use with
either road- or rail-transport and (in
1956) extended its interests to include
fork-lift trucks, passenger-buses and
general body-building by the purchase
of J. A. Lawton and Sons, Ltd., of
Adelaide. The South Australian
sidiary has since had some success with
a new line of buses and has re-established
earlier affiliations with Towmotor Corp.,
a leading U.S. manufacturer of fork-lift
trucks and similar equipment. Last term
Towmotor (Aust.), Ltd., was incor-
porated (the issued capital is held in
equal proportions by Towmotor Corp.,
U.S.A., and Freighter-Lawton Industries,
Ltd., S.A.), to co-ordinate the manufac-
ture and marketing requirements in Aus-
tralia and New Zealand for the Tow-
motor-Gerlinger and Freighter - Lawton
material-handling equipment and at the
same time provide the largest available
range of this type of machinery in Aus-
tralia.
Keeping up with possible trends, the
co., the year before last, joined with
International Piggy-Back, Inc., in Piggy-
Back (Australia) Pty., and with A. E.
Goodwin, Ltd. (Sydney), which acquired
an equal shareholding in the new pty.
co. last February, has been licensed to
manufacture equipment used in the
piggy-back system of carrying road-
trailers on specially-designed rail-cars.
Developmental and introductory work in
this, capacity is proceeding satisfactorily.
Another recent development has been
the decision to produce small fibre-glass
boats at the Freighter-Lawton plant in
South Aust. Manufacture of a range
of three American-designed Bell Boy
fibre-glass pleasure-craft is now under
way. Orders received are well in excess
of current production and the venture
is proving very successful.
Examination of the co.’s latest balance-
sheet reveals a decided improvement
in liquidity:

Despite creditors, higher at £395,728
(up £68,763), theoretical working-capital
jumped £157,537 to £568,252. Stocks and
debtors are up £118,998 (at £1,221,887)
and £116,658 (at £423,970) respectively
and bank overdraft has been reduced to
£566,762 (down £41,823). Even so, the
board has announced its intention to
issue £250,000 of 8 p.c. unsecured notes
with seven years’ currency, shareholders
ranking for priority of subscription to
the extent of £150,000. The funds raised
will be used to finance new activities,
expansion of fork-truck production and
for general purposes.
During the year portion of the co.’s
property in Brisbane was sold —it was
deemed necessary to revalue that part
remaining, in effect building reserves by
£13.138, as mentioned previously;
property in Melbourne was also disposed
of. Overall, however, the book-value of
freehold rose £14,729 to £770,502 and
of plant £43,670 to £793,619.
Turnover last term reached £3.1
million, 10 p.c. above that of the previous
year. Record sales were obtained in
S.A., Vic. and Tasmania. Freighters
continued to hold the major share of
the Australian market in articulated
road-transport equipment—the co. will
deliver its 20,000 th semi-trailer some time
this year. Increasing population, decen-
tralisation of industry and closer settle-
ment of rural areas augur better
prospects in the immediate and distant
future.
Growing diversification is adding
strength to the co., and shareholders,
while still smarting from the 1956
debacle, might well regard present
’Change valuation as conservative. In-
vestors, playing a cautious hand, are
giving 7s. lOd. for the ss. scrip, and
purchases at this price would yield 5.1
p.c. from an 8 p.c. div., with prospects.
Net asset-backing was 9s. 9d. at balance-

S.A. Rubber Mills, Ltd.
"O einvestment of substantial
proportions of its profits
from year to year has helped
this co. to consolidate its finan-
cial position and build-up an
impressive earning - capacity.
Shareholders benefited through
increases in the handsome div.-
rate and by two bonus-issues.
Following its incorporation
as a public co. in December,
1948, S.A. Rubber made par-
issues in 1951, 1954, 1955 and
1956. Together with a one-for-
ten bonus-issue in 1951, this
took the one-class capital from
£lOO,OOO to £400,000 by June
30, 1956. In November, 1957,
after balance-date, the paid-up
capital was brought-up to
£600,000 by simultaneous par
and bonus issues, both one-for-
four. There have been no
capital-changes since then:

The co. manufactures a
wide range of industrial-
rubber products, foam-rubber
and plastic-foam lines at fac-
tories at Edwardstown (S.A.)
and Dandenong (Vic.). Its con-
sumers are mainly the motor-
vehicle and domestic-appli-
ances industries. One of the
biggest customers is General
Motors-Holden’s.
The demand for the co.’s
products is steadily rising, and
future prospects seem good.
Last year’s production and
sales figures were not disclosed,
but were said to have “set new
records in the co.’s history.”
Certainly, the valuable outlet
provided by the G.M.-H.
custom should prove more and
more lucrative as the number
of Holdens crowding Aus-
tralia’s roads and highways
continues to grow.
The increased turnover,
“together with the continued
application of method refine-
ments” and modern techniques
of handling materials, enabled
S.A. Rubber to reduce prices
to its customers despite rises
in the wages-bill and increases
in the cost of natural rubber.
Net profit for the year
ended June 30, 1959, was the
highest on record, rising by

The figure was arrived at after
writing - off £166,470 (up
£20,033) for depreciation of
fixed assets and providing
£205,221 (up £24,035) for taxa-
tion. The tax-provision looks
a little high, at current rates,
on the earnings disclosed.
The profit is equivalent to an
earning-rate of 45.4 p.c. on
the average share-capital, and
amply covers the increased
dividend-cheque. The previous
year’s profits were equal to
36.2 p.c. on the bonus-
increased capital at the end of
the year (42.5 p.c. on average
capital).
Over the preceding four years
the average earning-rate was
44 p.c.
Last term, dividend was
increased by 5 p.c. to 20 p.c.,
absorbing £42,500 more at
£120,000 and leaving £152,370
for reserves, now built-up to
the impressive total of £773,724
(almost 1.3 times the paid
capital).
Further additions to build-
ings and plant at both factories
were made during the year
under review. The co. expects
to continue extensions to
capital-assets, as with known
forward contracts a period of
expanding production is antici-
pated. Certain buildings at
Edwardstown are to be re-
modelled during the current
term. Provision was made by
way of depreciation for the
demolitions envisaged.
The co.’s entry into plastics-
manufacture went a step
further. One of the most
modern plastic - extruding
machines in Australia was
installed. Limited production
was commenced, signalling

Manufacturer of Dufor Products
CHAIRMANS ADDRESS
The Chairman of Duly and Hansford Ltd., Mr. A , Duly, will give the following
address at the Annual Meeting of the Company to be held on November
25 at the Company's premises at Carrington Road, Marrickville. N.S.W.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Once again your Directors take
pleasure in presenting the Annual
Report, supported by the Balance
Sheet, Profit and Loss Account and
Auditor’s Report.
The past year has been a difficult
one throughout the Automotive
Industry due to increased operating
costs. In spite of this, the factory
operated satisfactorily and we
traded successfully. The increased
costs have been absorbed without
increasing selling prices of the
Company’s standard lines. These
have not been altered since 1955.
We are continuing a strong
campaign of improvement in all
production departments by the use
of modern machines which are
gradually replacing older machines.
Turnover and Net Profit show
a further increase over last year’s
results. The stock position is
interesting as finished stocks have
been reduced by £48,000 at cost
price, raw materials increased by
£43,000 and work in progress
increased by £23,000. This posi-
tion is most satisfactory in view
of the increased demands for the
Company’s products.
The Company’s property and
land and buildings have been
valued by the Valuer-General at
£399,510 and the increase over
book value of £134,404 has been
transferred to Asset Revaluation
Reserve, making this £314,183.
A review of principal items in
the accounts is now presented for
your information.
NET PROFIT.
The profit for the year was
£315,247, against that for the last
year £298,270, the increase being
£16,977. The amount charged for
Depreciation . was £89,437, against
last year’s total of £82,963. Pro-
vision for Taxation has been—
increased by £4,000 from £119,000
to £123,000. From the remaining
profit of £192,247 the Directors
recommend the payment of a final
dividend at the rate of 10% per
annum, amounting to £65,430
which, with the interim dividend
paid in July, makes a total dividend
of £130,859, against the amount
paid last year of £117,774. The
remaining profit of £61,388 will be
added to the accumulated profits,
making the total amount carried
forward £312,183.
RESERVES.
The total reserves shown in the
Balance Sheet amount to £750,526
after giving effect to appropriations
recommended by the Directors, and
with the exception of Unappro-
priated Profits, have not been drawn
upon during the year.
SHAREHOLDERS’ FUNDS.
The Shareholders’ Funds now
total £2,059,120 (last year
£1,863,328), an increase of
£195,792.
LAND AND BUILDINGS.
The new valuation of the
Company’s Properties by the
Valuer-General in June is £399,510,
an increase of £134,404 over book
values. The amount of £134,404
has been transferred to Asset
Revaluation Reserve.
PLANT AND MACHINERY.
£621,176 (last year £546,512).
After making provision for
Depreciation of the whole plant,
the Balance Sheet discloses a net
increase of £74,664 after adjusting
the liability under Hire Purchase
of £1,714, but the gross capital cost
of new plant installed during the
year was £140,000.
DEPRECIATION.
£89,437 (last year £82,963).
All plant and machinery has been
maintained in first-class condition
throughout the year. Adequate
provision for depreciation over the
whole plant has been made, and
the increase for the year is £6,474.
TAXATION.
£123,000 (last year £119,000) —
increase of £4,000.
SUNDRY DEBTORS AND BILLS
RECEIVABLE.
£229,634 (last year £228,685).
All accounts are in excellent order.
STOCK INVENTORY.
£1,203,284 (last year £1,182,019).
The increase that has taken place
in Sales has allowed us to reduce
the amount of Manufactured Stocks
by £48,000 below the value of those
held at the commencement of the
year.
The increase of £21,265 in Total
Stocks is due to the need to increase
stocks of Raw Material which now
amount to £335,628 and are con-
sidered necessary to service our
customers.
FINANCE.
The year commenced with a
Bank Overdraft of £107,000 and
at the year's end the amount was
£125,000. Sundry Debtors are on
the same level as last year, but
Sundry Creditors are up by £53,000.
Within the above financial struc-
ture we were able to purchase new
plant and equipment to the value
of £140,000, make additions to
buildings to the value of £33,000,
and increase purchases of raw
materials by £43,000 over last year.
PROSPECTS FOR THE CURRENT
YEAR.
The order position is good and
Sales for the four months July
to October are in excess of last
year’s figures.
To the members of our Staff l
express the appreciation of our
Board for the loyalty and support
they have shown throughout the
year.
To all the Company’s customers
we express our thanks for their
continued support.
A. DULY,
Chairman of Directors.

Visible capital-expenditure
last year totalled £219,439.
Freehold land and buildings
were £18,065 higher at
£499,086. The book-value of
plant, vehicles, etc., rose by
£34,904 to £349,782 (after
writing-off £644,161 accumu-
lated depreciation). A new
item, investments in other cos.,
appeared at £5625.
Stock was T 7095 lower at
£603,990, and debtors £2474
lower at £462,097. Liquidity
was considerably improved,
with the previous year’s
£86,229 overdraft being re-
placed by £61,127 cash and pre-
payments (up £59,905).
On the liabilities side,
creditors were reduced by
£23,823 to £256,213. Current
ratio was almost 1.9 to 1, aftd
net tangible asset-backing
worked out at 11s. sd. a ss.

S.A. Rubber’s remarkable
earning-power has won for it
deserved admiration from the
sharemarket, reflected in the
quotes made for its stock. At
the last sale in Adelaide the
ss. ords were changing hands
at 365. 6d., yielding 2.7 p.c.
National Minerals Holdings
'T'he holding-co. was incor-
A porated in February, 1956.
The changeover involved issuing
605,535 ss. f.-p. ords. in the
holding-co. for 4684 ss. prefs.
and 25,596 ss. ords. in the
old show. The holding-co.
thus started-off with a paid
capital of £152,384 at a most
interesting point in the post-
war minerals boom.
In July, 1956, National
Minerals allotted 4000 ss. f.-p.
ords. to acquire the remaining
minority interest in Beach
Mining Australia Pty.
In April, 1959, National
Minerals made a one-for-five
bonus issue, distributing the
proceeds of an assets-revalu-
ation. After balance-date, in
July, 1959, A. F. Toll Pty. (a
carrying - company) was
acquired for 51,106 f.-p. ords.,
making paid capital £195,637.
Owing to a 20 p.c. produc-
tion-cut and low rutile prices,
gross revenue from mining-
operations feil by £51,274.
The consolidated net profit
for the year ended June 30,
1959, fell by £11,113 to
£134,627, or 73.5 p.c. on the
bonus-fattened paid - capital
(78.2 p.c. on average share-
capital).
The result was achieved after
cutting the depreciation write-
off by £40,915 to £10,051, and
reducing directors’ fees by
£5OO. Tax provision fell by
£6425 to £53,783.
The div.-rate was reduced
from 80 p.c. to 50 p.c., absorb-
ing £86,149.
There were no major changes
in the balance-sheet.
On the whole, the co. made
a good effort under adverse
market conditions.
Recent developments on the
rutile market have influenced
the co. to operate plant to full
capacity. Soon the largest
single wet-plant unit in Aus-
tralia will begin working on the
deposits at Redhead.
Sellers are asking 15s. for the
ss. units, giving a yield of
16.7 p.c. flat without taking
into account capital-amortisa-
tion.


HASTINGS PEERING
FINANCE & INVESTMENT CO. LTD.
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS TO SHAREHOIDERS
Address of the Chairman, Mr. H. Hastings Deering, to the Ninth Annual
General Meeting of Shareholders held in Sydney on 30th September, 1959 .
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is with pleasure that I have to present to you the record
of another successful year in our Company’s business.
Today we are taking a forward look at our Company’s
work, confident in the knowledge that our progress has been
steady and constant; so much so that we were able this year
to finance approximately one-third more business than last
year. And our resources and opportunities are expanding.
While initiative, enterprise and sound management are
necessary for successful business, it is naturally to be expected
that our progress as a Company should be a kind of “measure-
ment-in-scale” of the advancement of Australia as a whole. We
render an essential financial service to industry, particularly in
transport, agriculture, and public works. And by our service
these life-streams of national development are supplied with
a wide range of goods; cars, commercial vehicles—from light
delivery units to heavy-duty trucks and buses—agricultural
tractors and equipment, heavy diesel tractors, and earth-moving
equipment.
Our services extend throughout the Commonwealth, with
New South Wales and Queensland providing the bulk of our
contracts.
Our Queensland business this year showed a marked
development, due to the increased sales of Caterpillar diesel
tractors. This trend is continuing, with large-scale projects
ahead in mining and in the clearing of vast areas of Queens-
land’s brigalow scrub lands for pasture improvement and closer
settlement.
In New South Wales, Ford vehicles and Fordson tractors,
particularly in the second half of the year, contributed sub-
stantially more business than last year. In this State, also,
returns have been healthily assisted by the financing of supplies
of equipment to contractors for the Snowy Mountains Scheme.
The Australian business in A.E.C. vehicles another
valuable franchise held by the associated companies—reached
an all-time high.
The financing of sales in these important fields is all first-
class business. And the year has brought a 33 per cent, increase
in its volume.
In consequence our net profit this year has improved and
the amount of £82,339 disclosed in the accounts, permits the
payment of a 10% dividend, plus increases of £lO,OOO in our
General Reserve and of £2,339 in carry forward.
We believe that in the coming year we shall be in a
position to make profitable use of additional funds, and,
accordingly, will continue to accept term deposits at present
rates ranging from five per cent. p.a. for three months to seven
per cent, for eighteen months and over. In the meantime, as
advised to the Stock Exchange, the Company has issued to
Hastings Diesels Limited—the largest of our Group Companies
with paid-up capital over three million pounds (actually
£3,040,000) —for cash subscription at par 300,000 shares of
£1 each paid to 5/- per share with calls to be made as
required. Apart from providing further working capital this
issue of shares, including the amount at present uncalled
thereon, will provide additional asset backing for borrowings.
I may add that since 30th June, 1959, we have had a
gratifying increase of £llO,OOO in term deposits.
In addition to assets in our Balance Sheet, we have a
human asset in an admirable staff to whose loyal service
during the year I pay due tribute. And we have an economy
in administration that has set the pattern for prudent yet
active efficiency in the whole of our Company dealings.
It is necessary, in the conduct of a Company such as this,
to be abreast of modern techniques in finance as it operates
both in Australia and elsewhere in the world. At this time last
year, I was overseas and I made it my purpose to study care-
fully the financial services given to industry generally in Britain,
Europe, Canada and the United States of America; particularly
those branches of industry which we service in Australia with
the Hastings Deering Finance and Investment Company Limited.
What I there saw on a broad international screen revealed
to me once more how essential it is to Australia’s development
that we should have an adequate and flexible financial service.
It also convinced me that our Company will be able to meet
those requirements in its own enlarging sphere, and in doing
so will be able to continue to earn satisfactory profits.
These are all elements to make for a still more prosperous
record of achievement in the future. Around us in Australia
are abundant signs of the uplift that has come to a stable and
strengthening economy. Production is high; prices for our wool
and markets for our beef are improving; new mineral and
agricultural wealth is in the process of being won; industry
expands. We, as a Company, have turned the point from which
we will be able to avail ourselves more fully of the opportunities
before us in financing the means for still more productive
wealth for the nation.
In the belief that you share with me the confidence I have
in addressing ourselves spiritedly and energetically to everything
the future holds, I have pleasure in moving the reception and
adoption of the reports and accounts for the year ended
30th June, 1959, as printed, and will ask Mr. Rowe to second
the motion.

From Herbert Holman
HThe belief that publicity—
any kind of publicity—
is good for the author is
refuted by Colin Wilson in the
November “Encounter.”
According to Wilson, “the
very fact that the writer’s
personality is involved is an
additional complication ....
Unless he is an exceptionally
unified being, a mutual distor-
tion occurs.” The effect of
this is to provoke an “anth
success” reaction among the
critics and, to a lesser degree,
among the public.
The argument is pursued
cogently, with case-histories of
some of the Angry Young
Men. John Wain’s and
Kingsley Amis’s first books
had rave notices and sold well,
Both expressed themselves a
good deal in reviews and
articles. Amis was detached
and aloof but Wain “tended to
be positive and pugnacious.”
Amis’s next novel received
lukewarm reviews, but Wain’s
received murderous ones. And
Amis’s third book had hostile
notices.
After explaining the success
of John Osborne’s first two
plays (Tynan’s enthusiasm for
“Look Back in Anger” and
Laurence Olivier’s appearance
in “The Entertainer”), Wilson
refers to the dreadful flop of
“The World of Paul Slickey”
and Osborne’s rash statement
that no English critic had the
intellectual equipment to deal
with his plays. “It was the
story of Wain’s second novel
repeated, but in front of a far
bigger audience.” He then
asks whether John Braine,
whose new novel is about to be
published, will suffer the same
drumming. “Could any re-
viewer,” he asks, “lay his hand
on his heart and swear that he
is uninfluenced by ‘Room at
the Top’ or what he has read
about Mr. Braine in the
‘Sunday Express’?”
Other instances cited are
Puccini (an organised claque at
the first performance of
“Butterfly”), J. B. Priestley (a
“dirty word” in some quarters)
and even T. S. Eliot (because
of the publicity given to his
plays and to his second
marriage).
Wilson admits that the suc-
cess of “The Outsider” unbal-
anced him. He was disillu-
sioned by reporters, who,
though sympathetic and cul-
tured, published his opinions
out of context. He also noted
unpleasantness and spitefulness
appearing in his press-cuttings
due, he thinks, to the distor-
tion of articles in the press and
to the “ordinary anti-success
mechanism.” He thankfully
ceased to be a “public figure,”
retired to the country and, like
others of his contemporaries,
fled to Scandinavia and Ger-
many to escape “murderous”
reviews. .
A lover of music, he has now
decided that he would rather be
a composer than a writer.
Wilde and West
“The Importance of Being
Earnest” (Old Vic) is a long-
overdue revival, having last
been presented in London in
1942. Anyone seeing the play
for the first time must needs
wonder at the culpable neglect
of so rich and high a comedy.
But older knpw
why. The 1934 production at
the Vic was at once so
remarkable and definitive that
producers have been reluctant
to invite comparison. By their
astounding performances as
Lady Bracknell and John
Worthing, Edith Evans and
John Gielgud identified them-
selves with the play to such a
degree that the mere mention
of it invokes their names, even
before the author’s. And later
revivals (1939 and 1942) were
dependent on their reappear-
ing in these roles.
Michael Benthall has not
been deterred by this once-
in-a-lifetime occasion. His
approach is fresh and dedi-
cated —more, perhaps, to the
players at his command than
to the author—and the result
is an evening of full entertain-
ment. Criticisms that this is
not Wilde (because Benthall
tones-down the aphorisms and
fails to bring out the satire) are
valid enough, but they ignore
a greater truth, the essential
one of illusion in the theatre.
This can best be expressed
by the interpretation of cos-
tume. Exact replicas of con-
temporary fashions look incon-
gruous or distracting on the
stage. The best designers art-
fully relate them to modern
styles. That the classics are not
immutable is a hard lesson to
learn. Because of changed
attitudes it is conceivable that
an 1895 production of “The
Importance” would have a
modern audience laughing in
all the wrong places.
The keynote of the produc-
tion, oddly enough, is tender-
ness. So far from being a
comedy of manners in the Con-
greve tradition, pillorying con-
temporary society, the evening
is one of simple make-believe.
While the 1934 production was
stylistic (one remembers,
especially, the “picture” when
Gielgud entered in mourning
for the imaginary Ernest, and
the link-hands finale) this is
only partially so.
In the period sense, the best
performance, a little gem of
stylised comedy, comes from
Rosalind Atkinson (Miss
Prism), and Norman Scace
(Algy’s manservant) is just as
apt in the smaller part. The
two young men (Alec Mc-
Cowen and John Justin) are
adequate, the one whimsical
in the early Bobby Howes
manner and the other orthodox
to the point of anonymity.
Barbara Jefford (Gwendolen) is
velvet-voiced, leg -o' - mutton
sleeved and feline, playing
Helena to the innocent but
decidedly not coy Hermia of
Judi Dench (Cecily) in the
play’s best scene. Miles Malle-
son is a benign Chasuble, while
Fay Compton, although in
tune with the others, hardly
seems at ease as Lady Brack-
nell.
At the Saville, Ronald
Gow’s adaptation of V. Sack-
ville-West’s “The Edwardians,”
is given pastiche treatment,
evoking the lesser Shaw and
Somerset Maugham. The cen-
tral idea (restless young noble-
man rebels against background
by taking-up Socialism) is
subordinated to his affair with
a society lovely whose hus-
band is a friend of his
mother’s. This play has little
dramatic interest, but does
reflect the raffish vulgarity,
idleness and utter worthlessness
of Edwardian high society.


Memoirs of a
Pioneer Pressman
(Abridged from a book to be published later)
By B. S. BAXTER COOK
(Founder of the Australian Journalists’ Association and No. 1 A.J.A. Gold Medallist)
GENTLE ALFRED DEAKIN
IN unusual circumstances
some secret Ministerial
information came into my
possession in 1910. There
had been a lot of newspaper
speculation on the question
whether the time had arrived
for Australia to have its own
Navy.
For several years Australia
had been paying a subsidy of
£200,000 a year to the British
Government under an agree-
ment providing for the main-
tenance of certain British war-
vessels in Australian waters.
The suggestion mostly favored
was that the £200,000 should
go towards the outright pur-
chase of the first unit of an
Australian Navy.
As I entered the Common-
wealth offices at the corner of
Collins and Spring Streets one
morning I was greeted by
Bob Cathie, the first head-
messenger and Federal house-
keeper.
“The Prime Minister has
been asking for you,” he said.
This surprised me, because
Alfred Dea k i n had never
asked for me in that way
before. He was essentially a
morning-newspaper man. He
had had his early training on
the Melbourne “Age.” In the
usual course, I used to see him
almost every day. He always
was very courteous, but also
he always appeared to be in
a great hurry to deal with
numerous papers on his desk
that seemed to need his im-
mediate and undivided atten-
tion.
This attitude was always
very disconcerting. It caused
me to hurry through political
matters on which I was hope-
ful of extracting some infor-
mation. Often he parried my
questions with what seemed to
be meaningless monosyllables,
or gestures always difficult to
translate into readable newsy
items.
The repetition of this pro-
cedure reached a stage when
editor Reay felt he was justi-
fied in administering a gentle
rebuke.
“You never seem to get any-
thing out of Deakin! ” he said.
I admitted the fact, and told
him how Deakin always
managed to evade committing
himself to any definite opinion.
“So that’s it!” he ejaculated.
“Now, take these questions
down and report back to me
exactly what takes place.”
I faithfully carried out this
assignment. I forget what the
questions were, but I remem-
ber that in my report to the
editor Deakin’s responses
were recorded, as before, in
nods and shakes of the head ;
a raising of the eyebrows as
if he were surprised to be
asked such a thing ; an occa-
sional smile ; a wave of the
hand; a shrugging of the
shoulders.
The Colonel twisted his
little moustache as he read my
report. Without any comment
he dropped it into the waste-
paper-basket. He never raised
the issue again.
With such experiences in
mind I could not understand
what had happened to cause
Deakin to send for me. I
asked Cathie had he any idea
what Deakin wanted to see
me about, but he could not
enlighten me.
“Is he busy just now?”
Cathie smiled. “When I was
in there a few minutes ago,
he was sitting relaxed in front
of the fireplace with his legs
comfortably cocked up, brows-
ing through the morning
papers.” -
As I still hesitated, Cathie
suggested that I should give
him a ring on the inter-
departmental telephone. There
was a telephone in the press-
room which was actually only
20ft. away from the desk in
the room across the passage
where Deakin sat. The tele-
phone-girl immediately
switched me on to Deakin.
“Cook speaking,” I said in
a matter of fact way. “Under-
stand you want to see me.”
“Oh, yes. It’s about that
Naval agreement. I’ve been
thinking the time is about ripe
to give the necessary notice
of termination to the British
Government.”
I immediately realised that
the Prime Minister thought he
was talking to his colleague
In his early crusading days
(as Phil May then saw
him).
Mr. Joseph Cook (later Sir
Joseph), the then Minister for
Defence, whose office was in
Victoria Barracks in St. Kilda
Road.
“Excuse me, Mr. Deakin,”
I interrupted, “this is Cook
of the ‘Herald! ’ ”
The dead silence could
almost be felt. There was,
however, that one little click
one can hear when a tele-
phone-mouthpiece is quietly
replaced.
TPhis left me in somewhat of
a quandary. Here was
one of the most exclusive
newspaper scoops of the day,
but I hesitated to take advan-
tage of the Prime Minister’s
unintentional disclosure.
I decided to ring Reay and
ask whether I should write the
story. I did this really to pro-
tect myself. As Deakin had
already let the cat out of the
bag, there was the possibility
he might make the formal
announcement to the morning-
press roundsmen later in the
day of the decision of the
Cabinet to lay the foundations
of an Australian Navy. In that
case it was quite on the cards
that Reay, who was a per-
sonal friend of Deakin’s,
might decide to contact him
more-or-less casually, and to
remark that he might have let
us have a bit of the Naval
Subsidy story, whereupon
Deakin could have assuredly
replied, “Cook knew all about
it!”
I had hardly opened my
mouth to tell Reay of Deakin’s
slip when he said, in very
harsh tones, “Don’t use it!”
and click went the telephone
again as the transmitter was
replaced.
Suspecting that Deakin had
got in before me and had
asked Reay to kill the story,
I made inquiries of the switch-
girl, and she told me that she
had rung Reay at Deakin’s
urgent request a little while
previously.
This outcome was quite
satisfactory so far as I was


personally concerned, because
it indicated that the news was
not ripe for publication, but
1 was sorry that I did not have
the opportunity of telling the
Prime Minister personally that
I had not taken advantage of
his slip, but had reported the
incident to the editor, as I
thought I was in duty bound
to do.
The irony of fate was that,
although Deakin had spent
many months on his project
The famous version of the
one and only “Billy”
Hughes (from Low’s
Bulletin gallery).
of establishing an Australian
Navy, and had, with the assis-
tance of his departmental
advisers, drafted several
schemes, his Ministry was
defeated before he could give
effect to any of them. Andrew
Fisher, who followed him as
Prime Minister, promptly took
the necessary action and
gained the credit of creating
the Australian Navy. After a
conference in London with the
British Government, Fisher
ordered two destroyers and
one first-class cruiser, as the
first Australian Fleet units.
A lfred Deakin was the
bane of newspaper re-
porters who were not very
expert shorthand - writers. He
was an accomplished orator,
and usually spoke at an ex-
ceedingly fast rate. When it
suited his purpose he could
adroitly surround his subject
with so many nuances and
interpolations that the whole
address had to be carefully
studied to decide what he had
really committed himself to.
It was just such a speech that
Sir George Reid in 1904
accepted as a “Notice to quit,”
as will be related here later.
When I was booked on one
occasion to report an impor-
tant address at one of the
periodical Australian Natives’
Association conferences I felt
I had a very difficult task to
perform.
The gathering was at the
Melbourne Exhibition Build-
ing. As it was an afternoon
engagement I had to arrange
for a team of message-boys to
stand-by and rush my batches
of copy to the “Herald” office
as soon as I could scribble
them out. I reasoned that if
I tried to take a shorthand
note, five minutes of Deakin
at his verbal gallop would
leave me struggling miles be-
hind. In that way I might
easily miss his more important
utterances. So I decided on
longhand. It seemed to work
out this way:
I would manage to get his
opening sentences on a phase
of his address, and in doing
that I would perforce miss his
many parenthetical modifica-
tions and flights of oratory, to
find him saying something
which seemed to me to fit in
nicely as a concluding sentence.
It was characteristic of
Deakin that he never left a
sentence “in the air.” How-
ever far he might go from the
opening thesis, he always
rounded-off his argument with
a perfectly fitting full-stop. So
I proceeded on these lines, and
thought I had made a respect-
able show in that evening’s
“Herald.”
Next morning at editor
Reay’s session, at which he
gave each member of the staff
his instructions for the day’s
work, he remarked that my
report seemed very different
from those in the morning
press. I had feared this. I
endeavored to explain how
handicapped I had been in
trying singlehanded to do a
three-man job, when Reay in-
terrupted.
“I’ll say this,” he said, evi-
dently quite happy about the
whole affair, “I can under-
stand what you wrote, whether
it was what Deakin intended
or not, but I find it difficult
to get clearly from the morn-
ing-paper reports exactly what
he was driving at half the
time. Perhaps you made him
seem rather too definite.”
■TVEakin’s early history, as
previously mentioned, was
bound-up with that of the
“Age,” which had a strong
protectionist policy. He was
elected to Parliament largely as
a result of its powerful advo-
cacy. All went well so long as
Deakin was prepared to dance
to David Syme’s tune, but
when the dance required of
him became rather too obvious
and Deakin did not perform
satisfactorily, the newspaper
autocrat turned against him,
and the “Age” began to ad-
versely criticise its former idol.
I think that Deakin, through
his press experience, could not
help being at times indecisive.
As a leader-writer on the
“Age” for many years, he
could argue convincingly on
any side of a question to suit
the B editorial policy for the
time being. If the policy had
to be changed, the leading'
article would be so cleverly
written as to appear to pass on
to the reader such verbal
indigestion as would have been
brought about by the news-
paper having to “eat its own
words.”
This trait of avoiding pre-
ciseness was so ingrained in
Deakin’s make-up that Mal-
colm Shepherd, who was his
first secretary in 1904, and
afterwards secretary to the
Prime Minister’s Department
. for many years, commented on
it in some historically impor-
tant personal memoirs, which
he showed me recently, but
which, up to this time of writ-
ing, have not been published.
He said:
“There was this fatal flaw
about Mr. Deakin: in his speech
as well as his actions he always
appeared to be afraid to be
definite, and, as a result, his
speeches seemed to lack con-
viction. He had a remarkably
analytical mind, was a most
omniverous reader, and pos-
sessed a keen sense of justice
....In my opinion he would
have been a much greater man
in the public eye if he had been
aware of his own greatness, for
that would have lent him the
confidence, without which
public men are inadequately
equipped. Although Mr.
Deakin was accorded much
appreciation, I am afraid the
public often missed the real
heights to which he rose in
some of his speeches. He was
a hard man to get near, and it
seemed as if, with all his
oratory, it was hard for him to
reach the hearts and under-
standing of the people.”
David Syme died in 1908,
but the “Age” anti-Deakin
vendetta continued unabated
under the lifelong editorship
of Gottieib F. H. Schuler. He
became especially virulent at
the time of the political up-
heaval when Protectionists and
Freetraders joined under
Deakin to upset the first Fisher
Ministry in 1909.
In this debate in the House
of Representatives, Deakin
undoubtedly had the most dis-
tressing and disturbing experi-
ence of his political life. He
was outrageously attacked by
Sir Willian Lyne, who called
him every kind of traitor he
could vamp-up in his mind,
from the “silver-tongued” to
George Reid (bagged by Phil May without his gun).


the lowest type; he was a
“treacherous friend,” a
“Judas,” etc.
Labor members were hardly
less vituperative; Hughes, in
more elegant diction, lashing
him with whips and stinging
him with scorpions. Hughes’s
contribution was generally
voted as the most memorable
critical speech ever heard in
the Federal Parliament.
Deakin was quite capable
of hitting back at his critics
very effectually, but he never
descended to vulgar terms. He
was of too gentle a disposition
to exchange abusive epithets
with political opponents. The
most telling phrase I remember
him using was during the de-
bate against the second Fisher
Ministry in 1910, when he
likened the behavior of Billy
Hughes, the Attorney-General,
to “a little boy dragged scream-
ing from the tart-shop.”
It could not be said that
Deakin’s political life was very
happy, although he had
done memorable service
for his country. An erudite
man of high literary attain-
ments, he was acclaimed
by party followers as one of
the most brilliant men who had
ever graced the Treasury
benches, and perhaps this com-
pensated to some extent for
the abuse his political enemies
showered upon him. But there
is this about such candid talk
in the House, that it often
sounds worse than it really is,
and hard-boiled politicians
who have been hurling insults
at one another are often seen
afterwards fraternising over a
“spot” or a cup of tea in the
refreshment-rooms.
/'Vne of the principal planks
of the Deakin - Cook
Administration was “New
Protection.” This was designed
by Deakin as an interlocked
scheme to guarantee steady
profits to employers by pro-
tection against cheap-labor
countries, reasonable hours
and fair wages for employees,
and equitable prices for pur-
chasers. It was widely re-
garded as a most progressive
piece of legislation.
The “Age” had its own
particular brand of protection,
which was said to have
received the blessing of the
Labor party. It would not
have a bar of Deakin’s pro-
posals and took every oppor-
tunity to try to tear them to
pieces with destructive criti-
cism.
Deakin did not complain
publicly of having fallen
from the good graces of his
erstwhile supporters, but he
expressed himself in very
bitter terms in private letters
to the “Age” proprietors,
charging them with attacking
the new protection policy with-
out their having adequately
published the main points of
the scheme itself, and also
with publishing misleading
reports of explanatory
speeches of members of the
Cabinet, and, in some cases,
ignoring such speeches alto-
gether,
The later, polished orator
(as seen by Low).
The new protection scheme
was approved by Parliament,
but Victorian manufacturers
attacked it in the High Court
and it was declared unconsti-
tutional.
After holding office for only
ten months, the Deakin-Cook
coalition was defeated. Deakin
did not seek office again. It
was not very long after these
experiences that Deakin’s health
began to fail. Close friends said
that what he considered unfair
tactics of the “Age” and the
cruel epithets hurled at him in
Parliament had bitten too
deeply into his sensitive nature
for him ever to want to take a
leading part in public life
again.
An unkind gesture came in
1914 from Hugh Mahon, a
Western Australian Labor
member. He had been a
member of the first Fisher
Administration in 1908, but
was dropped when the second
Fisher Administration was
formed in 1910. Some people
thought that this was on
account of his religion, but
there did not appear to be any
grounds at all for such an
assumption.
The fact was that Mahon, in
office, had behaved like an
autocrat. He had thus, made
himself personally unpopular
with his colleagues, and, as
Labor Ministers
were elected by the
caucus, he failed in
1910, by a narrow
majority, to get the
necessary support
to reach Cabinet
rank again. But he
got back once more
in the third Fisher
Administration in
1914, and was
allotted the port-
folio of Minister
for External
Affairs.
Mahon at times
could be very vin-
dictive, and this
was one such occa-
sion. He personally
disliked Deakin,
and at once began
rooting among the
departmental files
in the hope of un-
earthing something
in Aust r a 1 i a’s
foreign - relations
that might be detri-
mental to Deakin’s
a d m i n i s t r ation
when he held the
External Affairs
portfolio. At this
juncture Deakin
was practically in retire-
ment, but Mahon could not
resist the temptation of firing
a few political shots at the
dying gladiator.
I had numbered Mahon
among my personal political
friends, and I was made the
unfortunate vehicle of his bad
humor. After the publication
in the “Herald” of a statement
he gave me, I went.to Deakin’s
home in South Yarra to give
him a chance to reply. He did
so, and very effectively, I
thought. Next day, however,
Mahon came at it again. I
followed the same procedure,
and I thought Deakin’s re-
joinder, which I published, was
such as to close the controversy.
But, to be on the safe side, I
made the suggestion to the
editor, which he readily
adopted, that if Mahon wanted
to carry it on any further, we
should refuse publication.
Mahon’s original so-called
disclosure was of something
so unimportant that I have
entirely forgotten what it
was about,, but he still
sought to pillory Deakin,
and when I declined to take
his further statement he flew
into a rage and declared
that I was a personal enemy.
He practically ordered me out
of his office, with a parting
threat that he would have me
sacked. After that incident,
Mahon treated me as a
stranger.
But I was glad that I had
been of some service to Alfred
Deakin. He was a great Aus-
tralian statesman who never
spared himself in the service
of his country. Deakin,
through the exigencies of poli-
tical life, had gone through
many crises and doubtless had
a full appreciation of the old
truth, to slightly paraphrase
the immortal William, “Poli-
tics acquaints a man with
strange bedfellows.”
I felt that Deakin had tried
to play politics the hard way,
but his sensitive make-up was
unequal to the task of over-
coming the harshness, and
often the ingratitude, that lay
in the path of public life. His
political ups and downs had
bitten deeply into his soul,
especially when charges affect-
ing his honor were hurled at
him by political apponents and
erstwhile press-supporters.
A brief addendum may well
come in here on that
striking example of the ideal
public servant, Malcolm Lind-
say Shepherd. Industrious,
conscientious and efficient, his
loyalty and integrity were
beyond He gave
valuable service to the com-
munity for very inadequate
remuneration. True, when he
retired in 1937, he had been
honored with the C.M.G. and
1.5.0. But if anybody deserved
a knighthood it was Malcolm
Lindsay Shepherd.
I met Shepherd first in 1901,
when he had been transferred
from the N.S.W. Postal Depart-
ment to that of the Common-
wealth. He was the champion
stenographer and typist in the
service. Almost any short-
hand-writer could read his
Pitman notes.
When Deakin was Prime
Minister in 1904 he wanted a
private-secretary, and Shepherd
seemed to be the natural choice.
He acted in the capacity for
seven years. He remarked in
his memoirs that during that
period he “must have averaged
12 hours a day, including
Saturdays and Sundays, and

More Light on the Rising Sue
By BRUCE HARDING.
of the Staff of the Australian War Memorial
IN the question “Who
Designed the Rising Sun?”
(B. 16 /9 / ’59) the crux of
the matter is that there are,
in fact, two badges to be con-
sidered. The first is the badge
devised for the Ist Battalion,
Australian C o m m o n w e alth
Horse (early 1902) and the two
later variations of this design ;
the second is that introduced
for wear by the Staff of the
Military Forces of the Com-
monwealth (late 1904).
Two completely separate
administrative actions were in-
volved. The first badge was
required—and obtained—in a
hurry ; the second appeared on
the military scene in a more
sedate and correct fashion —
almost two years later.
Unfortunately, although The
Bulletin inquiry shows that
there is still surprisingly high
public interest in the question,
it does not provide—as it admits
—any “courtroom evidence.”
Except for W. F. Mullaney,
every participant in the birth
of these badges has now
passed on, so that avenue of
inquiry can be regarded as
closed. And because of Aus-
tralia’s shockingly apathetic
attitude in past years to the
organised preservation of
public records —i.e. official
documents —it would be noth-
ing short of a miracle if the
papers dealing with this matter
are still in existence. This
article, with the approval of
the Director of the Australian
War Memorial, is based on
such records as are in the
possession of the Memorial.
'T'he two men who, in the
A ’twenties and ’thirties, de-
voted much time and effort to
research into the badge-riddle
were J. L. Treloar (then
Director of the War Memorial)
and R. K. Peacock (then
Department of Defence
Librarian and an original
member of Hutton’s staff). The
conclusions reached by these
two are the ones that are now
generally accepted and quoted.
The difficulty of arguing or
doubting them lies in the fact
that no new acceptable evi-
dence has since been advanced
either officially or privately to
undermine their efforts. More-
over, with their experience and
official status, they would have
undoubtedly unearthed every-
thing factual that was worth
noting.
At the same time, however,
it is worth while examining
some of the questions now
raised in conjunction with the
Treloar-Peacock material and
other sources.
then, the time-
element in the matter of the
Commonwealth Horse badge.
Robert Gray suggests that
Hutton had not been in office
sufficiently long to have played
a decisive part in the design.
As to this, we have the follow-
ing evidence: Hutton estab-
lished his office at Victoria
Barracks on January 29, 1902.
The Ist Battalion, Common-
wealth Horse, embarked on the
transport Custodian on Feb-
ruary 18. The General had
thus been in office for 20 days.
Second point: the trophy-
of-arms appeared with
Hutton. According to Pea-
cock, Hutton got the idea from
a similar trophy over the
entrance to the Royal United
Service Institution Museum in
London.
Thirdly: Peacock says that
Hutton was himself clever with
a pen or brush, and used to
hand his watercolors to Pea-
cock for mounting.
Fourth: the final approval
for any badge for the Horse
would not have rested in
Lyster. This would have been
indeed was Hutton’s de-
cision.
Except for the fourth point
(see later) none of this is
courtroom evidence either, but
it strengthens the contention
that Hutton would have been
active and interested in the
badge design.
HPreloar and Peacock go
■*- further. They say that
Hutton was dissatisfied with
the designs submitted to him
featuring fauna and flora, that
he required “something
martial”; that he pointed to
the trophy in his office and
said “something like that.”
Then, he “invited a Melbourne
firm of cfie-sinkers to submit
designs,” based on the trophy.
That a Melbourne firm did, in
fact, submit designs is borne
out by the following letter from
the Deputy-Adjutant-General
(Hoad) to General Hutton
(who was in Sydney at the time
in connection with the im-
pending dispatch of 1 A.C.H.).
The date is February 6,
1902:
Dear General. Sketches of
badges enclosed for your considera-
tion. I think they should be half
the size.
The sketches were: (1) the
badge as worn by 1 ACH,
(2) the same, approximately
| larger and (3) “Advance Aus-
tralia” coat-of-arms in lieu of
the crown ; otherwise identical.
In reply, Hutton sent Hoad
a telegram which was received
at 3.32 p.m. on February
71-
Re badges designs one and two
approved please carry out in bronze
or dark metal.
Gen. Hutton.
This is followed by a minute
(presumably by Hoad) dated
February 8: —
Saw Deputy Controller (of
Stores) and arranged for badges
to be made about half the size.
The whole of the badges to be done
in 4| days.
These few scraps of paper
appear to prove that Hutton
had plenty of time to be im-
plicated ; that he was impli-
cated ; that Treloar and Pea-
cock were correct in saying that
an (unknown) Melbourne firm
submitted designs ; that Hutton
made the final choice of the
design ; and that the badges
were produced extremely
quickly. (They should have
been ready sometime on the
13th.)
IVToving now to the question
of Cox Taylor’s contribu-
tion, there is much evidence to
indicate that this officer did
submit some designs. To Lee’s
and Mullaney’s statements can
be added that of Cox Taylor’s
sister (Miss M. Cox Taylor)
who wrote on February 14,
1936:
The badge which has a general
resemblance to the rays of the
Rising Sun was designed by my
brother at the request of the late
Col. Lyster Amongst other
accomplishments and recreations
my brother was a clever draughts-
man, which was the reason that
Col. Lyster picked on him to submit
some designs He submitted
several designs and personally pre-
ferred others to that accepted by
Col. Lyster
General Sir C. B. B. White
(Hutton’s A.D.C. in 1904, and
then [1902] preparing to em-
bark as an officer of A
Squadron 1 A.C.H.) adds Feb-
ruary 28, 1936):
It is quite possible Cox Taylor
had some hand in its design because
he had distinct talent with a pen
or with colors.
Against this we come up
against Treloar’s concept that
Hutton rejected all the designs
submitted to him and then drew
attention to the trophy. If
such be the case, was Cox
Taylor brought to Melbourne
to see the trophy? ; was the
trophy taken to Cox Taylor in
Sydney? Or would it be more
feasible that the next event
was (as Treloar has it) that
Hutton simply handed the
problem to the local die-
sinkers? There is no docu-
mentary evidence of this —-
unless the firm can be traced
and has records to cover the
transaction. On the whole,
therefore, the circumstantial
indications are that Cox
Taylor’s designs were included
among those discarded by
Hutton, and that they possibly
did contain (as Gray says) an
adaptation of the rayed design
of the 6th Infantry badge. If,
however, Cox Taylor’s designs
contained flora or fauna,
Hutton would have rejected
them. Certainly, because of
time and distance, Cox Taylor
could not have submitted any
later design based on the
trophy. While the 6th Infantry
“sun” bears no resemblance,
other than the general semi-
circular effect, to the badge of
the 1 A.C.H. I am convinced
that Cox Taylor had no part
in the finally accepted design
as worn by 1 A.C.H.
'T'urning now to the other
"*■ badge—that is, the 1904
design, this is how the story
appears:
The main reason for
Hutton’s presence in Australia
was to devise a scheme for the
amalgamation of the various
State military organisations
into the military forces of the
Commonwealth. One aspect
of this task was the design and
introduction of a standard
mode of dress for the new
army. To formulate policy in
this direction Hutton estab-
lished a special committee,
with Surgeon-General W. D. C.
Williams as president. It was
this committee which subse-
qently drafted the first Com-
monwealth dress-regulations.
Design and manufacture of
the badges for the proposed
uniforms was entrusted to the
old Birmingham firm of cutlers
and medallists, Messrs J. R.
Gaunt and Sons. Gaunts were
instructed to design a badge

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
The Cup Week
Favored by unusually good
weather for Melbourne’s
spring, Cup Week was a
memorable success. Over the
four days of racing the crowds
exceeded 200,000, and in the
final wash-up there wasn’t
much between punters and
bookmakers.
Youthful trainer R. W.
(Dick) Roden is entitled to be
proud of his success m
getting Macdougal fit to win
the Melbourne Cup. The geld-
ing did not travel well from
Sydney, and, after recovering
from that upset, he injured a
leg in a training-gallop. Eleven
days before the Cup he was
unable to meet his engage-
ment in the Cox Plate. Care-
fully nursed by Roden, he was
well enough to run in the
Hotham Handicap on Derby
Day, and his sterling second
to Grand Garry foreshadowed
his Cup win. The Hotham was
just the hit-out Macdougal
needed, and no horse went to
the post fitter for the Cup.
Melbourne Cups are won in the
last furlong, and in the final stage
Macdougal came right away to win
by three lengths from Nether Gold,
inches to White Hills —one of
most decisive wins in recent Cup
history. The time, on a fast track,
3.23, was moderate against the race-
record of 3.19|, shared by Comic
Court and Evening Peal.
Before his Hotham second, Mac-
dougal was at 25 to 1, but at
barrier-rise it was eights. Nether
Gold was at 20 to 1, White Hills
fifties. The favorite heavily
backed on the day was Mac at
5 to 1. He ran poorly, beating
only a few home.
Macdougal, even if he is not in
w.-f.-a. class, deserves to be ranked
with the great staying handicappers
who have won the Cup. His per-
formance to complete the Brisbane
Cup-Metropolitan-Melbourne Cup
treble is unique. He has won nine
races, been placed in If others,
and earned £33,504 in stakes.
Bred at Trelawney Stud (N.Z.), he’s
a six-year-old gelding b'y Travel
Boy’s sire, Marco Polo 11, and is
from the Foxbridge mare Lady Fox.
Bought by the late R. H. B. Brown,
a Queensland grazier, for 1800gns.,
he is now raced by R. N. Brown,
son of the original owner.
Adelaide jockey Pat Glennon did
eveiything right on Macdougal,
continually threading his way out
of trouble in the big field, and
saving his mount for the final,
successful run. He was engaged
for the mount only on the eve of
the Cup, in much the same dramatic
way as he secured the winning ride
on Comic Court for the 1950 Cup.
The Oaks result indicated
why bookmakers are on better
terms with their bank-managers
than are most punters. In the
10-furlongs Wakeful Stakes on
Derby Day Adelaide filly Mint-
away looked to have the race
won a furlong out, but was
easily passed by Sydney filly
Weeamera. Punters, not sur-
prisingly, made Weeamera a 10-
to-9 favorite in the Oaks, but
Mintaway did her best work
over the final furlong of that
mile - and -a - half to score
narrowly from another South
Australian, Rose of Summer,
with Weeamera third. In a
“Bill Wasn't kiddin when he caught this one!"
four-horse blanket-finish Twi-
light Glow did best of the Vic-
torians to finish next.
Bred by her owner, R. C. Stuart,
Mintaway is by imported Orgoglio
from Penrua, and is the first of
Orgoglio’s progeny to win over 12
furlongs. Orgoglio himself never
won beyond a mile.
In a season when there are
fewer really good horses than
usual, Noholme is clearly the
best galloper in Australia. He
started twice over the Cup
carnival, to make one-act affairs
of the mile Linlithgow Stakes
on Oaks Day and the £5OOO
C. B. Fisher Plate on the final
day. The Plate win was par-
ticularly interesting, because it
was a mile-and-a-half race, and
the decisive manner in which
the colt beat the older horses
—leading from barrier to box
—suggested that he could have
won both Derbys.
It is unusual for a Star Kingdom
horse to get a distance, and poses
the interesting question of how far
Noholme’s full brother, Todman,
will travel if he comes back to
racing. Trainer Maurice McCarten
is adamant that Todman is much
the better of the brothers. Noholme
has won at nine of his 13 • starts,
to earn £19,167 stakemoney.
The 10-furlongs Batman
Stakes is regarded as a conso-
lation-prize for horses beaten
in the Victoria Derby, but
Derby runner-up Ringleader
was no match in the Batman
for the little-known Nilarco,
who was not considered good
enough for the classic.
There is no prize for “might-have-
beens” in racing, but the Batman
form does suggest that Travel Boy
w'as lucky to win the Derby, in
which, barring the mishaps to
Martello Towers and Dhauligiri, he
would probably have had to be
content with third money.
The N.S.W.-owned two-
year-old gelding Hydrell is
proving a Turf bargain: he
made his record three wins
from as many starts when he
took the Byron Moore Stakes
on Oaks Day, ending the
unbeaten record of Adelaide
colt Dalai. Hydrell is raced
by Wollongong businessman
C. H. Messiter, who paid
500gns. for him in the hope
that he would win a race at
Kembla Grange, where Mes-
siter is a committeeman.
Hydrell is obviously well above
provincial class —his Byron
Moore win was by five lengths.
In the November Hurdle on
Oaks Day visitors saw one of
the best hurdlers to race in
Australia for many years—
Resotto, who careered away to
win by eight lengths. Resotto,
a Grand National winner,
carried the huge burden of
12.1. Nearest horse to him in
the weights carried 9.12.
Reg Ansett’s helicopter is
now a familiar sight of Mel-
bourne’s racecourses, but
trainer R. Wallis claimed that
the noise from it upset his
charge, Sweet Wendy, prior to
her second to Makoli in the
Mimosa Stakes on Cup Day.
Makoli won very easily,
making her record four wins
from five starts.
Melbourne two - year - olds
had their longest race of the
season in last Saturday’s
Flemington Stakes down the
straight six. The race went to
the grey colt True Mist, by
Meadow Mist from Aolata.
Trainer Bill Murrell, who was
at one time a horsebreaker, con-
fessed that True Mist was such
a fractious colt that he had
to secure outside assistance to
tame the youngster for racing.
Lady Sybil, who won the
two-year-old fillies’ event on
Saturday, the Ottawa Stakes, is
New Zealand-bred, by Count
Rendered from Cassiopeia, and
is raced by Cyril Doody, who
mixes bookmaking with breed-
ing. Lady Sybil showed
sparkling dash to lead almost
throughout in smart time.
Incidentally, Sweet Wendy,
with the Ansett helicopter
absent, was favorite for the
Ottawa, but ran only a moder-
ate sixth.
• • •
Although Victorian horses did
surprisingly well at Caulfield to win
the Guineas and Cup, Sydney
entries had all the prize-cuts at
Flemington. Through Hydrell,
Travel Boy, Noholme and Mac-
dougal, Sydneysiders can claim the
best two-year-old, three-year-old,
w.-f.-a. and handicap stars.
It is Williamstown Cup Day
at Caulfield next Saturday, and
defeated horses in the Mel-
bourne Cup will be after that
prize. Grand Garry may win

Himself in Melbourne to see
Noholme climax a brilliant
spring round with an easy win
in the £5OOO w.-f.-a. Fisher
Plate, Randwick trainer
Maurice McCarten also won
the main event at Canterbury
Park the same afternoon, when
Akatarawa landed the £1750
Frank Underwood Cup. Akata-
rawa has won six of his 10
races at that course, and on
most occasions has spread-
eagled his fields. Latest win
was another runaway affair,
and his time for the 9i fur-
longs, 1.58 j, was a race record.
In the absence in Melbourne
also of N. Sellwood, his usual
rider, the Akatarawa mount
went to Doug Weir, riding in
top form (he had scored four
wins at a provincial Wyong
meeting earlier in the week).
Rifleman, though a four-
year-old maiden, started
favorite for the Campsie
Stakes, but he had to be ridden
out by Weir to beat Jose and
Newcastle mare Cleave, who
seemed unlucky to lose, as she
came from the rear of the field
and swung wide in the closing
stages. Cleave has won four
Newcastle races, three of them
at 11 furlongs, and could
quickly make amends for her
defeat. Rifleman is by Enfield
(imp.) from Car Loo by Lo
Zingaro (imp.) from Nejma
(imp.) by Prince Galahad. He
comes from a winning family,
one member being Strephon,
a fine stayer who won the
Victoria Derby and St. Leger
and the A.J.C. St. Leger.
Before winning his first race,
the First Ashbury Stakes at
Canterbury Park, Erskine had
started only once, for a good
second to Forestage at the
same track on October 14.
Raced by Mrs. Jack Large
and trained at Randwick by
Jack Mitchell, he’s a three-year-
old gelding by Newtown
Wonder (imp.) from Merry-
wise.

Swallow Tail, easy winner
of the Canterbury Park Second
Maiden Two-year-old, races
for an interesting group-
ownership: Mrs. Jack Craw-
ford ; Dave Chrystal, snr. ;
Dave Chrystal, jnr.; George
Ryder; A. Dowling. And the
easy style in which the winner
raced away from his 11 oppo-
nents indicated a quick follow-
up success. Tom Smith trains
the youngster, a son of Byland
(imp.), a grey sire, the few of
whose progeny so far tried
have given excellent promise.
Byland won 11 races in Eng-
land. Swallow Tail, a product
of Woodlands Stud, Denman
(N.S.W.), is a half-brother to
Big Jake and Flower Vale,
winners in two-year-old com-
pany. Their dam, April
Flower, is by Pherozshah
(imp.) from Knockfin by Hunt-
ing Song (imp.). Knockfin won
11 races in New Zealand.
It looks as if the owner-
breeders of Fun And Fancy
have another Fine And Dandy
carrying their colors. A
younger sister of the latter top
two-year-old, Fun And Fancy
could, in fact, develop into
one of the best youngsters of
the present term. She’s by
Star Kingdom (imp.) from
Shading by Brueghel (It.) from
Gold Tinge by Claro (imp.).
Star Kingdom (imp.), the
sire also of Noholme, had
another winner at Canterbury
in Staraway, while Coomrith
Star (second to Fun And
Fancy) is yet another of his
progeny. Costing 3300gns. as
a yearling, Coomrith Star was
fancied by connections, and he
came along with a fast late
run, indicating he may not be
long in winning. Coomrith
Star, prepared by Tom Ken-
nedy at Rosehill, is from the
Manitoba (imp.) mare Alcestis,
who has thrown a number of
winners, among them Thessaly
Star, a smart Brisbane per-
former, and King’s Realm, also
a good winner in Queensland.
Winchester won his third
race from four starts when he
narrowly defeated Seal Keeper,
with Mt. Royal third, in the
Canterbury Frederick Clissold
Handicap. The win gave
apprentice Harry Trenear his
third success on the Brueghel
(It.) horse, and it was the lad’s
best riding performance so far.
He had to ride well to beat
Seal Keeper; indeed Ray
Selkrig, on the runner-up,
congratulated the midget
apprentice on his clever riding.
Incidentally, though he missed-
out, Gay Port was heavily
backed.
Though perhaps generally
regarded as best suited by a
heavy track, Crebious is reck-
oned by his veteran trainer,
A. N. McCoy, to be suited
by any sort of going ; also that
he improves with racing.
McCoy appears to have some-
thing there ; Crebious won the
Canterbury Welter on a firm
track as well as he’d previously
won in the wet.
The New Zealand Cup, run
over two miles, proved easy
last weekend for five-year-old
mare Foglia, ridden by W. D.
Skelton. She defeated Anacapri
and Nerula in 3.22. She’s oy
Rolled Gold (imp.) from
Netherlee by Hello Peter (imp.)
from Lucky Alice by Lycullus
(imp.). A member of the Cutty
Sark family, she’s a sister to
Nether Gold, runner-up to
Macdougal in the Melbourne
Cup four days before the N.Z.
two-miler. Netherlee is a half-
sister to Broiveine, dam of the
1952 Melbourne Cup winner,
Dalray.

well since going to Brisbane
from Sydney, continued the
good work at Doomben by
winning the Summer Cup in
fine style.

“P.0.M.C.”: The A.J.C. is
to be commended for turning
the old barn on the Flat at
Randwick into a respectable
eatery. It might achieve addi-
tional patronage if it sought
the advice of structural-
engineers in finding an alterna-
tive to the duckboard footway
at the Flat-Leger crossing of
the course, which for years
has tried the patience of
punters wishing to cross the
track after races —especially
after the last on wet days. A
gently-graded tunnel under the
track would be ideal, but if
(as has been argued) this is
impracticable, surely a low-
slung portable bridge that
could be swung aside would
be possible.
The Trots
The 18,600 at Harold Park
on Saturday night saw a
thrilling blanket-finish in the
Handicap. Delvyn Ringer led
a bunched field until well into
the straight, when he was
challenged by General Scott,
Field Dixie and Dune. At the
winning-post Field Dixie had
his nose in front of General
Scott, who was a neck ahead
of Delvyn Ringer, with Dune
only a whisker away. There
was a less-appreciated spectacle
in the race, too. The favorite,
Guiseppe, dislodged his driver
in a scrimmage at the start,
and then made a complete
circuit of the track, with the
spider turning catherine-wheels
behind him. From the 60yds.-
behind mark Loreto Noel gave
a good exhibition of trotting
to get to the front in the first
lap and lead all the way in the

BONG BONG PICNIC RACES
'T'he Old Bong Bong Picnic Races at Bowral (N.S.W.) will
be held on November 21. This race-meeting is a
revival, in costume, of the original Old Bong Bong Picnic
Races, which were a social feature of the Bowral area from
1887 to 1930.
For months people of the district have been planning
and making their costumes, mostly of the turn-of-the-
century style, getting th.eir horse-drawn vehicles in shape,
training horses again to harness, men have been growing
beards, side-burns and moustaches, women have been
training their hair again in ringlets, and generally entering
into the spirit of this peep-into-the-past race-meeting.
It will be a registered meeting, run under A.J.C. condi-
tions and under the supervision of the Southern Districts
Racing Association. After this novelty-meeting it will
become part of the southern districts circuit, with its normal
annual meeting in the autumn. For this novelty-meeting the
Veteran Car Club will visit Bowral, terminating at the
course, which is at Wyeera, Kangaloon Road, Bowral,
owned by R. Jackson. It is about two miles out of town.

Other Sports
The Centenary match in
Brisbane between Benaud’s XI
and Lindwall’s XI, interfered
■with by rain in the early parts,
produced some rattling bright
ciicket in the two second innings.
It was not actually a “testimonial”
match, but it had all the aspects
of one —free hitting and a general
picnic air about it; nothing hinged
on the result. It’s a moot point
whether games of this sort are a
fair indication of anything; they
often leave an impression that the
bowlers send some easy ones
“down the leg-side” just to be hit.
Among the most successful bats-
men were McDonald and Harvey,
a century each (Harvey had been
out of form in Sydney grade-
cricket), O’Neill, Burge, Stevens
and young Queensland bat lan
Oxenfcrd, who made such a good
impression in his first Shield games
last season.
Among the howlers controversial
speedsters Rorke (4-42) and Meckitf
(3-47), and Kline (4-44), all first-
innings efforts, did best.
“Veryl”: In a match in Mel-
bourne’s Mercantile Association,
A.W.A., batting first, lost two men
before it was found that the other
team, McEwans, was fielding 12
men. After bunging one man
off, the game proceeded.
During the week the umps. took
the matter to the association,
which suggested that the two bats-
men be allowed to go in again.
However, nothing like that was
done, and the match went on' apace,
McEwans winning. A Melbourne
cricket-writer asked what would be
the position if such a thing hap-
pened in a first-class match. With
so many checking on play in big
cricket, that’s hardly likely; still,
there should be something in the
laws about it, which there isn’t at
present.
“Bail”: Gordon Rorke left
for Pakistan with more
than thoughts of how to de-
molish the Pakistanis.' The
amount offered for him to play
in Lancashire League runs
into four figures, and he
wouldn’t be up for a penny in
any other way. Lancashire
League is so anxious to get him
that it’s sending a representa-
tive to Pakistan to have a
“look” at him. If Rorke
reproduces the speed he de-
veloped against the M-C.C.
last year he can, in fact, prac-
tically name his own figure.
“Y.”: Re “Three of the Great”
(B. 28/10/’59): C. T. B. Turner,
an off-spin bowler, was also an
author. He didn’t believe in body
swing, then coming into vogue, but
in a supple wrist, plus finger-spin.
His book showed bowlers how to
grip the ball with the index finger
curled down near the thumb on
one side and the other three fingers
well away, gripping the ball. This
made the ball swerve to the off and
flash off the pitch, especially in
suitable winds. A top-spinner and
a “yorker” were also used —the
“yorker” gained most of his 300
c 1 e a n-b owl e d victims. Ray
McNamee was another great otf-
spinner; he played for N.S.W. until
in his forties. McNamee excelled
for Randw.ick on Coogee Oval, the
sea breezes floating his spinners
giddily.
• • • •
“Monty”: Lift a lid to
Keith Gofton, skipper of
Metropolitan (Toowoomba)
B-graders and recently selected
to lead Toowoomba’s B-grade
side against Stanthorpe. He
gets through with only one leg,
batting around the middle of
the list and throwing down
some slow spinners also.
* * *
“Golfer”: South African
Gary Player has his hands
insured for many thousands,
and well he might. Those hands
have already brought him a
fortune, and his win in this
year’s British Open is estimated
as being worth something in
the vicinity of £50,000 during
the next year. He turned-in a
course-record 275 for the 72
holes of the Victorian Open
last Saturday, to beat fellow-
S’African Harold Henning by
five strokes, with Peter Thom-
son next.
* * *
“Sportite”: Loss by Sydney
Rugby Union of Australian
five-eighth Arthur Summons to
the League is a serious blow,
and now Ken Catchpole, the
youthful Randwick half-back
who’s regarded as the best
half in Union since the war,
has a tempting bait. The offer
is several years’ contract at a
sum close to five figures. Ken
has said he would play League
some day, but he wants to have
a couple of overseas trips with
Union teams first, and there
isn’t a footballer who doesn’t
envy those fortunate enough
to get an overseas Union tour.
It’s the tour of all tours —
something never to be for-
gotten.
* * m
“Sam”: In the first Rugby
Union Test between the
British Lions and New Zea-
land the Enzedders won be-
cause of the great goal-kicking
of fullback Don Clarke, who
landed six penalties, though the
Lions scored four tries to nil.
In the Australia-France Rugby
League Test French fullback
Lacaze kicked eight goals, six
of them from place kicks, the
other two field-goals. The
tourists scored four tries to
one, Barnes converting all four,
and Australia winning 20-19.
If scoring-points were the same
in League as in Union the
French would have won.
Lacaze, a 25-year-old light-
weight, is a left-foot kick.
“Mitron”: Overseas tours
by Soccer teams during the off
season would seem to have a
strong case in their favor on
the ground of benefit derived.
Following its successful Aus-
tralian visit, Scottish team
Heart of Midlothian main-
tained its form to retain the
Scottish League Cup. At time
of writing Hearts are also on
top in the Ist Division League.

Rugby Union officials are
considering changing the color-
scheme of the Australian
jersey. Plan is to have a gold
jersey with the coat-of-arms
embossed on a green back-
ground. The change is needed
to avoid clashing with Ireland,
South Africa and Italy, the rep.
teams of all of which play in
green.
* * *
“Tennisite”: They call
Edwards, the energetic boss of
the Queensland Lawn Tennis
Association, “Big Bill,” and
anyone going north and see-
ing the effect of his energy on
tennis up there appreciates why,
apart from size, he’s called
“Big Bill”—he thinks that way.
He has won most of his duels
with the Lawn Tennis Associ-
ation of Australia over the
friendliness of the Q.L.T.A.
towards Jack Kramer, but he
foresaw the possibility of the
southern States jacking-up on
him over sending players to
the Queensland championships.
It could have been found that
they were required elsewhere,
though this was unlikely in
view of the growing strength
of tennis in Queensland.
Edwards was taking no risks.
He induced wealthy Mel-
bourne businessman Bob
Mitchell to represent Queens-
land on the council of the
L.T.A. of A. —a shrewd move,
because Mitchell employs Aus-
tralian stars Roy Emerson,
Martin Mulligan, Bob Mark
and others. No one can dictate
to him, and so Edwards is
assured of a supply of talent
when he wants it. Furthermore,
Mitchell is business-manager of
Mai Anderson, now one of
Kramer’s pro.-troupe.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
FRANCE'S SUMMITRY
C'ome editorial reactions to
General de Gaulle’s state-
ment that an East-West summit-
meeting ought to be postponed
at least until early next year:
New York “Herald Tribune”:
“Whether [the decision] is
wisely taken is impossible to
tell now. But it is based on a
reasoned argument which we
[the U.S.], as France’s partner
and ally, have to take into
account.
“General de Gaulle does not
regard a summit-meeting as
merely another episode in the
round of informal talks which
have been taking place between
East and West. For him it is
a grand conclave of the highest
importance, not to be under-
—London “Daily Express.”
“BUT, HAROLD, COULDN’T WE LEND HIM ONE OF OURS, IF THAT WILL GET HIM TO THE TABLE QUICKER?”
taken hasffly or lightly. It
must depend on a continuing
relaxation of tension. It must
be preceded by meticulous
preparation and consultation.
Otherwise, how could the
Heads of State and Govern-
ment resolve in a few days the
problems of Berlin and dis-
armament —to name only two
—that have baffled the mar-
shalled forces of world
diplomacy for the best part of
the past year?
“The British, however, want
an early meeting in order to
capitalise on the ‘spirit of
Camp David.’ They believe
that the quicker the summit,
the easier it would be to work
out a modus vivendi on
Berlin. Disarmament will be
taken up in any case early next
year by the 10-Power confer-
ence at Geneva. Time enough
then to solemnise such agree-
ment as may be reached.
“Washington has seemed
receptive to both these points
of view. Pains have been
taken to point out, in support
of a summit postponement,
that the Coolidge disarmament-
report (a joint effort of the
State Department and the
Pentagon) will not be ready
before January. In other
words, it might be better to
go to the summit with our
disarmament dossier in perfect
order, or at least in new
order.”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph”:
“Both assessments within the
alliance can be defended with
formidable arguments. But the
question which becomes more
and more pressing is whether
an alliance which includes two
such differing views on the
true nature of the problems
facing it can survive—except
in name. For if once the
Western European Powers
were to decide that the United
States and Britain had wrongly
assessed the nature of the
danger facing them they would
be compelled to seek their
security outside the alliance.
“This may sound unduly
melodramatic. But it would
be unwise to ignore the impli-
cations of Mr. Khrushchev’s
acceptance of General de
Gaulle’s invitation to visit
Paris, or the reports that the
Italian President is planning to
go to Moscow. In part these
may well be only extensions
of the fashion set by Mr.
Macmillan last year. But in
the present context of disunity,
distrust and confusion they are
far from encouraging auguries.
They might lead to a greater
consensus in the West, but,
knowing Mr. -Khrushchev’s
guile, they very well might not.
“The only ray of comfort is
Mr. Eisenhower’s acute aware-
ness of the present perils.
That is why he is willing to
return to Europe so soon after
his previous visit. The sooner
the better.”
* * *
Edinburgh “Scotsman”: “De
Gaulle’s insistence that a
summit-meeting must be pro-
perly prepared is merely a
makeweight argument. Of
course it ought to be properly
prepared, but it ought also to
be seen in a properly prosaic
light as merely one stage in a
prolonged endeavor to tackle
outstanding problems piece-
meal.
“De Gaulle can truly claim
that he is faithful to earlier
and less - realistic Western
views about the nature of a
summit-meeting. In actual
fact, it seems unlikely that he
places the slightest hopes in
disarmament, while he almost
certainly believes perhaps
with better reason that no
new agreement is possible over
Berlin.
“What his views are on
East-West problems is, how-
ever, of less importance than
his evident decision that if he
is not to be given his place
of privilege in the world-wide
direction of Western policy he
will use the well-tried tactics
of obstruction. His public
statement means that if a
summit-meeting were to be
held before the spring he would
not be there, and any agree-
ment would not be binding
on France. The price for
changing his mind would
almost certainly be too high.”
* * *
“Yorkshire Post”: “Why
should Britain and the United
States be in the least dis-
pleased that President de
Gaulle (and for that matter
Dr. Adenauer, too) should
talk with Moscow? It is pretty
well accepted in the West by
now that such face-to-face
meetings of statesmen supreme
in their countries are on
balance more likely to benefit
the cause of peace than harm
it; and it is curious to note
that only the modern tech-
nological age, which has made
the threat to civilisation so
acute, has also made such
frequent top-level meetings
possible.
“We have only one reason
to feel anxiety over journeys
between Moscow, Paris and
Bonn: the fear that Mr.
Khrushchev might play upon
sectional West German and
French ambitions and pre-
judices as against Britain and
the United States. So he may,
and it would be astonishing
if he were not at least aware

of the latent possibility of
doing so.”
Why East Germans
Flee
TVescribing in the British
monthly “Contemporary
Review” a 10-day tour of
East Germany, Richard
Barkeley, a political-scientist,
notes that “as far as one can
judge from a brief visit the
Zonal Government has suc-
ceeded in creating a standard
of living which compares not
too unfavorably with that of
the West, in spite of fewer cars
(still beyond the reach of
ordinary wage- or salary-
earners), fewer TV-sets, fewer
refrigerators.
“Why, then, the"high number
of refugees fleeing to the West
—those who, in Lenin’s words,
vote against the regime with
their feet?
“The answer to this question
was made clear during our
visit to the Humboldt Uni-
versity in Berlin. We attended
a lecture on the relationship
between Schiller and Goethe,
given in one of the big rooms.
It was in the traditional
German style, transmitted by
loudspeaker, and could have
been delivered at Heidelberg or
Marburg. But—and here lay
the difference —the professor
not only wore the badge of
the Socialist Unity Party
(S.E.D.) in his buttonhole but
also started his lecture with
a reference to the Conference
of Foreign Ministers then
meeting at Geneva, in which
he assiduously repeated all the
demands of his Government.
“This impression that all life
is subject to the demands of
the party, which is identical
with the State, was powerfully
reinforced when visiting the
former concentration-camp at
Buchenwald, near Weimar.
“An impressive, though too
monumental, memorial tower
has been erected here, and
some of the prisoners’ blocks
and the execution-barracks are
left undisturbed as a reminder
of Nazi brutality. Unfortu-
nately the impression is marred
by the fact that a memorial
plaque giving the names of
those German Resistance-
fighters who lost their lives
fighting Hitler omits the
names of those who took part
in the conspiracy of July 20,
1944. The guide, when asked
why Stauffenberg, Goerdeler
and the other victims were not
included, maintained that they
had not been genuine anti-
Fascists.
“A similar plaque was shown
at Leipzig in the Dimitrof
Museum. A man’s supreme
sacrifice is acknowledged only
when it fits into the pattern of
behavior set by the party. We
were told that over the entrance
to the old Buchenwald camp
had stood the motto Recht
oder Unrecht, mein Vaterland.
Now the motto seems to be:
right or wrong, my party.
“How far the falsification of
history goes is shown by a
further omission in the
Dimitrof Museum, where one
wall is devoted to ‘stepping-
stones’ to war. A photostat-
copy of the Munich Agreement,
of September, 1938, is exhibited
here, but nothing at all about
the Ribbentrop-Molotov agree-
ment of August, 1939 —surely
as much a stepping-stone as
was the other. Our inquiry as
to why this had been omitted
was received with ill-grace,
more so than any other of our
numerous questions, and the
answer was unconvincing.
“There is the flavor of
Orwell’s ‘1984.’ Even the past
is made to serve party ends.
This seems to lay bare the
essential fact: in spite of the
protestations of democracy,
the former Soviet Zone of
Germany is a Communist dic-
tatorship where all that is done
is done for the sake of the
party. There is no Opposition
paper (what miserable sheets
are the so-called C.D.U. and
liberal papers in the zone!),
no Opposition whatsoever;
everything is directed to serve
party ends, and State and party
are one. While we were there it
was interesting to hear some
British Left-wing politicians
speaking over the zone radio
and praising working-class
achievements. It was tragi-
comically reminiscent of Right-
wing politicians who, 25 years
ago, praised the Hitler regime
because of good road-building,
or Mussolini because trains in
Italy arrived on time.
“But this is a German State,
and the party slogans must be
reinforced by philosophy, by
Weltanschciung. Professor Thal-
heimer, at the Humboldt Uni-
versity, told us that he based
his lectures on literary history
on the materialist conception
of history, and that lectures on
Marxism-Leninism are partly
compulsory, often highly
recommended, for students.
“This Procrustes bed of
thought—that everything that
results from research must
conform to the theoretical
party tenets —nullifies much
that could otherwise be
achieved in the fields of culture
and learning. It may be pos-
sible to produce good engineers
and other technical experts,
but students whose critical
faculties cannot be developed
because they may draw con-
clusions inimical to the ruling
party theories will be inferior
to those who take nothing for
granted.
“Added to this is an almost
touching naivete due to lack


NORTH BROKEN HILL LIMITED
(Incorporated in the State of Victoria )
Chairman's Address
Address delivered by the Chairman of Directors, Mr. M. L. Baillieu, at the Ordinary General
Annual Meeting of Stockholders of North Broken Hill Limited held on Friday, October 30, 1959.
On behalf of the Board, I present
to you the Accounts of the Com-
pany and the Directors’ Report
for the year ended 30th June, 1959.
As a copy of those documents has
been sent to each stockholder, I
propose, with your concurrence, to
take them as read.
FINANCIAL
The financial results for the year
as shown in the Directors’ Report
are considerably better than in the
previous year.
It is pleasing to note that, de-
spite continued adverse marketing
conditions for lead and zinc, the
Mine has again become a con-
tributor but, unfortunately, still
a modest contributor, to the
Company’s profit for the year.
You will have seen in the Report
that there has been a further in-
crease in lead stocks either as
metal or in lead concentrates held
by The Broken Hill Associated
Smelters Pty. Ltd. under its con-
tract to purchase from your Com-
pany but which, at 30th June, re-
mained unsold. We must recognise
that such increases in stocks could
continue until world lead markets
are again capable of absorbing
world lead production.
For the year under review, the
realised price of lead averaged
£AB4 3s. sd. a ton, a fall of
£A7 9s. Bd. compared with the
previous year. Also, there was
a very slight fall of 0.3 d. an ounce
in the price of silver. On the other
hand, the average price of zinc
rose by £A4 3s. 9d. to £A9I 17s. 3d.
a ton. Stockholders will be inter-
ested to know that for the first
quarter of the current financial
year, the average realised prices
for the lead and zinc derived from
our concentrates were £AB7 16s. 3d.
and £AIOI os. 6d. a ton respect-
ively.
The metal which contributes
most to our revenue is lead, which
is much less costly to treat and
refine than zinc. Nevertheless, the
rise in the price of zinc since the
closing of the Accounts will help
to offset the continuing disadvan-
tages to the Company of what we
feel is a relatively low lead price
coupled with the further disability
that we are unable to realise our
full output of that metal.
In addition to its revenue from
the Mine, the Company received
£602,809 from its investments com-
pared with £624,225 in the previous
year. Although the revenue under
this heading was lower, the sum
received as dividends was higher,
the difference in income being en-
tirely due to the lower interest
received following the withdrawal
of moneys from fixed interest
securities for use in the Company’s
business.
On reference to the Balance
Sheet, it will be seen that the Com-
pany’s investments are divided into
two groups—“ Shares in Com-
panies dealt in on a prescxubed
Stock Exchange” and “Shares in
Other Companies,” both of which
are valued in the Accounts at cost.
From the former group, namely,
the investments in public com-
panies, which are valued at
£1,612,457 in the Balance Sheet,
dividends amounting to £222,411
were received during the year.
It is pleasing to record that the
present market value of these in-
vestments is in excess of £6,000.000.
So far as “Shares in Other Com-
panies” are concerned, your Com-
pany’s principal holdings in this
group are in:—
The Broken Hill Associated
Smelters Pty. Ltd.
Metal Manufactures Limited.
The Electrolytic Refining and
Smelting Company of Australia
Pty. Ltd., and
The Commonwealth Aircraft Cor-
poration Pty. Ltd.
From all the shares in this
group, which are valued in the
Balance Sheet at cost at £2,363,237,
we received during the year £371,080
in dividends. I do not propose to
make any further comment on the
value of these interests except to
say that they are obviously worth
considerably more than the Balance
Sheet figure.
You will have noticed a change
in the presentation of the Com-
pany’s accounts.- In the place of
the former Working Account and
Profit and Loss Account, a Profit
and Loss Statement has been sub-
mitted. In it have been included all
those items which previously were
in the two former accounts; but as
a result of regrouping there are
now shown, firstly, those items
which are attributable to the Com-
pany’s operations as a Mining
Company, and the surplus from
these operations, and, secondly, the
Company’s investment income less
the income tax payable in respect
of it. The resultant total surplus
has been carried to the Appropria-
tion Statement, from which an
amount has been set aside for ex-
penditure in the current year on
plant and equipment.
INVESTMENTS
Probably your Company’s most
important Investment is its hold-
ing in The Broken Hill Associated
Smelters Pty. Ltd. In the financial
year 1958/59, its profits were again
satisfactory when regard is had
to the level of metal prices and the
restricted throughput at the
Smeltery.
This month a new refinery cap-
able of treating increased quan-
tities of lead bullion was completed
at Port Pirie, S.A., and came into
successful operation. The new
plant should not only enable the
Smelters to produce an even higher
quality product but by reason of
its modern layout should enable
substantial economies to be
effected.
At the Coal Cliff Colliery, N.S.W.,
to which I made reference last
year, the programme of develop-
ment and mechanisation is now
substantially completed. Produc-
tion of washed coal from mechani-
cal mining began in June last.
During the year a contract was
made for the sale of 1,250,000 tons
of washed coal to Japan over a
period of five years.
Reference is made in the Annual
Report to your Company, together
with The Zinc Corporation Limited
and Broken Hill South Limited
entering into a new fifteen-year
agreement as from the Ist July,
1959, for the sale of their output of
lead concentrates to The 8.H.A.5..
and to the concurrent alteration
of our shareholding in that Com-
pany from 36.4 per cent, to 30 per
cent.
Your Directors consider that the
previously mentioned adjustment
of shareholdings which was be-
tween our Company and Broken
Hill South Limited, together with
the new agreement, will materially
strengthen the Smelter Company
and therefore your Company’s in-
terest in it. Also, in the long
term, the changes should facilitate
the further development of Port
Pirie as a smelter site.
The programme of research into
new uses of lead in the United
States, which is being supported
by 8.11.A.5. in conjunction with
leading producers in other
countries, has begun with an exten-
sive investigation into the funda-
mental properties of the metal and
an examination of the possibilities
of expanding present uses as well
as developing new uses.
We rate amongst our major in-
vestments our holding—about 18
per cent.—in the capital of Metal
Manufactures Limited, which, with
its factories in New South Wales
and Victoria, is the major Aus-
tralian producer of copper, brass
and aluminium wires, stranded
cables and tubes.
Through that holding, we have
an equivalent interest in Austral
Bronze Company Pty. Ltd., which
manufactures rods and sections,
sheets and strips, in the same
metals, in New South Wales, Vic-
toria and Tasmania.
Both of these Companies are now
extending their manufacturing
operations to Queensland —as is
also Cable Makers Australia Pty.
Ltd.
The last-mentioned company, in
which Metal Manufactures Limited
has a little less than a 50 per cent,
interest, is the main Australian
supplier of rubber and plastic-
insulated power cables. Metal
Manufactures Limited also has a
half interest in Austral Standard
Cables Pty. Ltd., which produces
telecommunication cables.
This group of industries pro-
vides essential supplies to Aus-
tralian engineering and manufac-
turing industries, and, as -well, to
power generation and distribution,
transport, and communication
enterprises. Its order books are
sound and Metal Manufactures
Limited is maintaining its divi-
dend rate of ten per cent.
The Electrolytic Refining and
Smelting Company of Australia
Pty. Ltd. has again had a success-
ful year, profits being slightly
better than for the previous year.
The Company has decided to pro-
vide continuous casting equip-
ment for the production of copper
shapes used in the manufacture of
sheet and tube. This change of
practice follows the market de-
mand for higher standards of
quality.
Effective smelting capacity has
been raised sharply by the com-
pletion of the Lurgi sinter plant,
but it is already apparent that
there will be severe overseas com-
petition for ores, concentrates and
other raw materials for treatment.
Japanese smelters, in particular,
are favoured not only by relatively
cheaper labour and sea freights,
but also by a high domestic price
for copper.
The Minister for Trade has in-
structed the Commonwealth Tariff
Board to conduct an inquiry into
the nature and extent of future
tariff protection to be granted to
the local copper mining industry.
The current copper bounty legisla-
tion will expire on the 30th June,
1960, and it is interesting to note
that the terms of the inquiry have
regard to the fact that a number of
isolated communities depend en-
tirely upon copper mining.
Commonwealth Aircraft Corpora-
tion Pty. Ltd. in which your Com-
pany is a shareholder, has had a
satisfactory year, the previous
year’s turnover being maintained.
Government decision is still
awaited on a new project to follow
the current order for Avon/Sabre
aircraft, which carries the manu-
facturing nrogramine to 1961.
This delay already has caused
some loss of skilled personnel
necessary for aircraft manufacture
and therefore considerable effort
has been concentrated on recruit-
ment and the provision of work
for the technical staff, in antici-
pation of a new project being
allotted to C.A.C. by the Govern-
ment.
Repair and overhaul of Avon/
Sabres for the Royal Australian
Air Force still continues, to the
great financial benefit of the Ser-
vices as against the cost of new
aircraft.
The Ceres Agricultural aircraft
developed by the Company is
proving successful in operation,
two aircraft having been sold and
orders pending for others.
With the slowing down of De-
fence orders over the past twelve
months, the Company has re-
entered the field of bus body manu-
facture.
Our other principal investments
are in public companies whose
Reports and Accounts are pub-
lished, and therefore I feel there
is no need for me to comment on
their affairs.
MINE
Ore produced from all sections
of the Mine amounted to 363,500
tons as compared with 382.272 tons
for the previous year. T'he prin-
cipal reasons for the lower output
were the reduced number of work-
ing days and an outbreak of fire
on the 1,700 feet level of the North
Section. There is now no further
evidence of fire and the pouring in
of slime filling appears to have
effectively sealed the fire area.
The sinking of No. 3 Shaft un-
fortunately has again been impeded
by the faulted nature of the rock
encountered. However, the exca-
vating and concreting of the No. 1
Loading Station has been com-
pleted. The auxiliary cage com-
partment in the Shaft has been
equipped with runners and the
cage, after successful testing, is
now operating to the 3,520 feet
level. Also, air, water, power and
signalling services have been com-
pleted to that level on which the
main drive to the ore bodies has
been started since the end of the
financial year.
Because difficult sinking condi-
tions are likely to persist for some
distance, it is hard to predict the
rate at which the present stage of
shaft sinking to a depth of 4,320
feet, or some 50 feet below the
4,270 feet level, will progress. At
the present time, the shaft sink-
ing has reached a depth of 3,734
feet and the concreting of the
3,670 feet level is in progress. Be-
tween that level and a depth of
4.320 feet, plats will be cut for
four new levels and No. 2 Loading
Station will be excavated between
the 3,920 feet and the 4,120 feet
levels.
The date of bringing No. 3 Shaft
into service will depend on the
progress of these works and other
factors but it is not dependent on
reaching the target depth.
I wish to emphasise to Stock-
holders that ample ore reserves are
available for mining in the area
serviced by No. 2 Shaft to satisfy
our production requirements until
such time as No. 3 Shaft will be
brought into operation.
At the 30th June. 1959, ore re-
serves were estimated at 4.344,000
tons compared with 4,558,000 tons
for the previous year. This reduc-
tion in the reserves is due to the
slow progress of No. 3 Shaft limit-
ing the amount of developmental
work possible at the lower levels,
and to the omission of a small
amount of marginal ore.
For the year under review,
6.765 feet of diamond drilling were
completed underground in the
North and British-Junction sec-
tions. The greater portion of this
work was aimed at delineating the
lode below the 3,370 feet level.
This drilling indicated that the
Southern Orebody is over 300 feet
wide at the 3,520 feet level, and-,
therefore, that the widening of the
orebody in that area to which I
referred last year is almost cer-
tainly correct.
It is gratifying to be able to
observe that if such is the case
the tonnage of ore per vertical
foot in the Southern Orebody at
this horizon will be as great, if not
greater, than on any other level
in the Mine. However, further
deep drilling below the bottom
level, which should be of profound
interest, cannot be undertaken until

of information about condi-
tions in the West. We were
twice asked whether under-
graduates in Britain were per-
mitted to read Marx, and
students expressed much sur-
prise when we told them that
education was above party in
this country. They think in
categories, and as the West is
wicked it must deny freedom.
“It is tragic that so much
sincere effort and so much
obvious goodwill is not used
to better purpose. Improve-
ments in the standard of living
and all expenditure in the cul-
tural field will not make good
the lack of freedom and the
dominating spiritual con-
formism. While these prevail
there will always be people
who prefer the uncertainty of
a refugee’s existence to the
fleshpots of submission.”
the sinking of the Shaft makes
suitable drilling sites available.
Exploratory work lias been con-
tinued on the leases at the north-
ern end of the property. The
work carried out in this area has
consisted of diamond drilling,
and geological mapping, in con-
junction with aerial photography
and geophysics. This has broadly-
followed the programme decided
upon two years ago. However,
work of this nature is slow and
tedious, and such a programme
usually has to undergo minor
modifications as additional infor-
mation is built up from various
sources.
It is expected that this work will
be sufficiently advanced by the
latter half of 1960 to attempt a
further appraisal of the area.
In the meantime I can only
report that up to the present time
there has been no significant dis-
covery of ore within those leases.
The Mill operated successfully
during the year on an all-flotation
circuit. Lower operating costs
were achieved and, partly owing to
the higher grade of ore mined,
improved recoveries of lead, silver
and zinc were obtained.
I am pleased to report that the
general performance of the Mine
has shown an improvement over
the previous year, and this has
been reflected in the costs of pro-
duction. This improvement must
be very gratifying to all thinking
people associated with the Mine,
for it must be recognised that
stability for the Company and for
Broken Hill can only be assured
by a continuance of mining pros-
perity.
At the 30th June, the Mine
labour force was 162 less than at
the end of the previous financial
year, due to resignations and re-
tirements and to retrenchments
consequent upon the cessation of
major capital expenditure and the
depletion of the ore reserves at the
Blackwood and Thompson Shafts
to which I referred last year.
To ensure that senior members
of the staff are kept abreast of
the latest developments in manage-
ment techniques, two of the Mine’s
senior executive officers attended
courses at the Australian Admini-
strative . Staff College during the
year.
The three year Agreement
between the Broken Hill Mining
Companies and the Barrier Indus-
trial Council and Affiliated Unions
regarding rates of pay and con-
ditions of work on the Line of
Lode expired on the lltli July,
1959. Discussions on the new
Agreement are now taking place
between the Mining Managers and
representatives of the Unions.
During the year. Senator the
Honourable S. D. Paltridge,
Minister for Shipping and Trans-
port. and members of the Govern-
ment Members Rail Standardisa-
tion Committee, visited Broken
Hill. Discussions with local bodies
took place on the possibility and
advantages of converting the
present Bft. Gin. gauge railway line
between Broken Hill and Port
Pirie to standard 4ft. Slin. gauge.
At the same time rail installations
on the Mines and in the Broken
Hill area were inspected. Your
Company is vitally interested in
any proposals for the re-equipment
and modernisation of the line to
Port Pirie, and it is believed that
industry in South Australia and
New South Wales, as well as the
Broken Hill Mining Industry,
would benefit greatly from a first
class rail connection through
Broken Hill to Adelaide.
In .Tune last,' members of the
Federal Mining Committee visited
Broken Hill. Problems facing the
Mining Industry were discussed
with representatives of the Mining-
Industry and local bodies.
GENERAL
During the year our output of
lead concentrates was sold to The
Broken Hill Associated Smelters
Pty. Ltd., but that Company’s
opportunities bf selling metal were
limited by the continued effect of
world over-production.
I referred to this situation at
the last Annual Meeting and told
you of the efforts then being made
by the Broken Hill Mining
Industry and individual producers
in other countries, to restore the
balance between industrial con-
sumption and the amounts being
offered for sale, by voluntarily re-
ducing production.
In November, 1958, a conference
under the auspices of U.N.O, was
held at Geneva to discuss world
trade in lead and zinc, but no
agreement was made for the limi-
tation of production or sales of
either metal. In April this year
a further meeting was held at the
U.N.O. Headquarters in New York,
at which the leading exporting
nations agreed to limit the
quantities of both lead and zinc
which would be offered for sale.
Australia was a party to this
agreement, and sales by B.H.A.S.
continue to be limited in accord-
ance with it.
There is no doubt that the action
taken by the producer/exporting
countries, when taken with im-
proved consumption consequent
upon increased industrial activity,
has had a beneficial effect on
the market conditions for both
metals. This is particularly so in
the case of zinc for which the
U.S.A. price has risen by the
equivalent of £AI7 a ton during the
past twelve months and the
London Metal Exchange spot price
by over £A2S.
On the other hand, while there
appears to be some improvement
in the balance between the indus-
trial consumption of lead and the
amount offering for sale, the U.S.
price is the same today as it was
a year ago, and the London Metal
Exchange price is somewhat lower.
The U.S.A. still maintains its
system of quotas for lead and zinc
metal and concentrates in order
to control such imports into that
country in the interests of the
domestic mining and smelting
industries. The quota system was
instituted in October, 1958, and,
while it has effectually limited
imports into U.S.A. its effect on
the market conditions for both
metals in that country was delayed
because of the large stocks
available for sale at the time the
quotas were imposed.
In the present financial year,
your Directors intend to follow
the policy of the mine producing
to maximum capacity within the
limits of the ten per cent reduction
in working time at Broken Hill.
As a result, it is expected that
the Company’s output of lead in
'lead concentrates will again exceed
its proportion of the B.H.A.S. sales
of metal and that, consequently,
there will be a further increase
in the stocks of lead or of
lead in lead concentrates unsold
which will be brought into the
accounts at cost of production.
However, we are receiving a
somewhat better average price for
lead than last year because our
sales in the United States, although
limited, are on a more favourable
price basis and a better price
is being received in Australia. Also,
we are selling most of our output
of silver and the whole of" our
zinc concentrate production at
what, to date, are more favourable
prices than obtained last year.
Therefore, if present conditions
continue throughout this financial
year, the surplus from operations
will be larger than for the year
1958/59.
We expect that our income from
investments will be of much the
same order as for last year.
Before closing, I would like to
say that the Company has a very
rich and well-equipped mine at
Broken Hill, aiul we can only
hope that before too long markets
will be such that a return
reasonably in accord with the
amount invested in the Mine will
again be earned.
Finally, I want to again express
the thanks of the Board to the
Staff of the Company for their
work during the past year and
for the full measure of their con-
tribution towards the advancement
of the Company's affairs.
Chinese Wool Cloth
T>radford “Wool Record”
notes that wool cloth from
Communist China is being
offered for sale in Britain for
the first time “and is attract-
ing interest—as one might
expect, for the event is a highly
significant one.
“We have never thought of
China as anything but a market
for the wool textiles of the
West. At one time she im-
ported large quantities of
British wool cloth, but that
trade ceased before the war,
and now China is chiefly of
importance to the U.K. in-
dustry as its largest overseas
market for tops. It comes as
somewhat of a jolt to learn that
the Chinese are now 'com-
petent enough to venture into
world markets with their own
wool products.
“Our correspondent reports
that, price for price, the
Chinese are giving better value
for money than the Japanese.
They also offer eight weeks’
delivery and guarantee match-
ing. Some business may ensue,
if only as a trial run. And
what then? Does the Chinese
Government intend to em-
bark on an export drive, or
will it use the bulk of the
country’s increasing wool-
textile production for domestic
needs?
“There can be no doubt that
the Chinese populace could do
with more warm clothing and
blankets. But China has to
import wool to feed her mills
(Chinese buyers were among
the leading operators at [the]
opening sales in New Zea-
land), and it is therefore very
likely that some proportion of
her output will be sold abroad
to earn foreign currency,
especially sterling.
“It may be a long time
before Chinese mills reach the
standard of Western Europe ;
there cannot, however, be any
question but that eventually
their competition will become
a serious matter. It may, in
fact, be the Japan story all
over again. Russia has made
no secret of her aim to enter
into competition with capitalist
producers, so that in the fore-
seeable future Britain may find
herself faced by cut-price com-
petition from two quarters.”

U.S. Senator J. W. Fulbright:

may not be apparent. But I

this for the magnificent salary
of £3OO a year.”
Shepherd recounts that
Deakin worked hard, “not to
say slavishly,” and expected
others to do the same. When
Deakin went to his private
retreat at Point Lonsdale, “to
do some official work free from
constant interruption,” he used
to leave his private-secretary
sufficient work to keep his
weekends occupied, invariably
accompanied by the thoughtful
intimation that he did not wish
to interfere with his Saturday-
afternoon and Sunday relaxa-
tion, “so long as it [the infor-
mation] was ready when he
returned.” Here is a typical
set of Deakin’s directions to
Shepherd on such a week-
end :
(1) See letter “Fruit Inspection”
in “Argus,” Jan. 4, and refer to
Customs for explanation.
(2) What has New Zealand bor-
rowed since our Federation? —so
as to compare with our borrowings
for the same time per head.
(3) Look up newspaper reports
June arid July last for threats of
Labo'r men and Labor members
about blocking all business in Par-
liament.
(4) If anything else arises about
Waratali let Col. Foxton know, and
if a Minister is wanted, refer to
'him. [The steamer Waratah, Aus-
tralia to London bound, disap-
peared mysteriously off the South
African coast in 1909 with a loss of
300 passengers and crew.]
(5) Collect from “Hansard” the
objections of Labor Senators to the
Interstate Commission Bill, and
particularly to the powers con-
ferred as a Court of Industrial
Appeal from State Wages Boards—
also from State “Hansard” and
newspapers—the declarations of
State Labor men.

One might offer the comment
-on the above schedule duties:
“And the rest of the weekend
Shepherd could devote to his
own private affairs!”
Tn 1911 Shepherd was
appointed official secretary
of the Prime Minister’s
Department, as distinct from
the private-secretaryship, and
his salary began to assume
more adequate proportions.
In that capacity he served
also under Prime Ministers
J. C. Watson, George Reid,
Andrew Fisher, Joseph Cook
and William Morris Hughes.
He went to London in 1921,
as secretary of the High Com-
missioner’s Office, and for a
year acted as High Commis-
sioner. Six years later he
returned to Australia to become
secretary of the Commonwealth
Defence Department.
Shepherd’s memoirs cover
about 260 closely typewritten
pages, with several appendices.
They contain many matters of
great interest relating to the
building-up of the young
Commonwealth from 1901 to
1937. For instance, among the
secret documents is a copy of
the famous Cabinet Minute,
prepared chiefly by W. M.
Hughes, in which the Fisher
Government, in 1909, asked
the Governor-General, the Earl
of Dudley, to dissolve Parlia-
ment, following the carrying of
a no-confidence motion moved
by Mr. Deakin in the House
of Representatives. The
“ ’Erald!”
Cabinet Minute was held in
high legal and political circles
as a masterpiece of clever
reasoning in Hughes’s best
style. But his Excellency
refused the request.
There are many other con-
fidential official documents in
Shepherd’s memoirs, as well as
private communications be-
tween persons in exalted
places. Perhaps the most
interesting of his memoirs from
a general public point of view,
however, would be his intimate
personal sketches of Prime
Ministers Deakin, Watson,
Reid, Fisher, Joseph Cook and
Hughes, as well as of Sir John
Forrest, W. A. Watt, and other
prominent members of the
Federal Parliament.
Shepherd also includes a few
extracts from “Hansard” of
the stirring proceedings in the
House of Representatives of
those early days which cul-
minated in the fatal collapse
of the Speaker, Sir Frederick
Holder.
Those memoirs should not
be allowed to be buried in an
unpublished portfolio.
REID BURIES THE HATCHET
When the Reid-McLean
Administration took
office in 1904 Mr.
Reid (later Sir George)
was Prime Minister and
Minister for External Affairs.
As usual on such occasions,
the political roundsmen turned-
up as a body to offer con-
gratulations to the new occu-
pant of the Ministerial chair.
I joined the group with some
trepidation, because Reay had
fallen foul of Reid. The inci-
dent had taken place some
months previously, when Reid
was Leader of the Opposition
in the House of Representa-
tives. Reay was a Protec-
tionist and a keen supporter
of Alfred Deakin. He could
not stand a bar of Reid.
One day Reay wrote a lead-
ing note commenting on some
statement, which I cannot now
recall, made by Reid in a
public address. Reay used the
expression, “The man is as
spurious as his politics.” At
Parliament House that day
Reid accosted me and said that
while he had nothing against
me personally, he must refuse
to see any representative of
the Melbourne “Herald” until
it published an apology.
“I don’t mind what your
paper says about my political
beliefs,” he said, “but when
you say that personally I am
spurious, I must take serious
exception.”
I reported this to Reay, and
he said Reid could go to
blazes.
Well, there I was with the
bunch of pressmen waiting to
see the new Prime Minister,
and wondering whether I was
to be ignominiously kicked out.
“Welcome, gentlemen,” said
Reid, with pride in his voice.
“I think I have met nearly
all of you before as Leader
of the Opposition.” He slowly
readjusted his monocle and
ran his gaze over the pressmen
present. He paused at me.
“Well, well!” he ejaculated.
“And here’s the little ‘Herald,’
too! ”
Then, after what to me was
an awkward pause, he added,
“I suppose, as Prime Minister,
1 must let bygones be bygones
and treat you all alike. Yes,
you may stay, little ‘Herald.’ ”
At a later date, when I had
established a more friendly
footing, I called Reid’s atten-
tion to the fact that an enter-
prising manufacturer had dis-
played him with a waistline
that could be measured by the
yard, in a neck-to-knee flam-
boyant bathing-outfit. Even
his best friend could not say
that Reid’s physique would
lend itself to the idea of a
man’s fashion - model. His
rotundity in the poster, how-
ever, could truthfully be
described as grossly exagger-
ated. I suggested that to cari-
cature a Prime Minister in that
way was infra dignitatem.
“I don’t mind how they
caricature me,” he commented
laughingly, “so long as they
don’t overlook me altogether.
That’s the worst thing that can
happen to a politician.”
But it was significant that
the posters disappeared shortly
afterwards.
'T'he Reid-McLean coalition
lasted only about eleven
months, when Reid suddenly
decided to resign because of
that speech (previously referred
to) delivered by Deakin in
Ballarat. Reid accepted this
as a “notice to quit.” Deakin
had acquiesced in the forma-
tion of Reid’s Administration,
which was really a coalition
between Freetrade represented
by Reid, and Protectionists led
by Allan McLean. Deakin did
not take office in it. Reid knew


that Deakin’s party was strong
enough to oust him when
they felt the time was
opportune.
It was generally understood
that Reid had nothing definite
to go on in arriving at his
momentous decision to resign,
beyond the newspaper reports
of the speech. These were,
naturally, very much con-
densed. Shorn of Deakin’s
parenthetical verbal delinea-
tions, the speech appeared to
Reid to be the forerunner of
what he regarded as further
humiliating criticisms.
The resignation of the Reid-
McLean Government was' fol-
lowed by a general election.
An old friend of mine, J. E.
Davenport, who was reporting
the electioneering tour by Sir
George Reid in Queensland,
told another rotundity story —
it was one of the best jokes
of the campaign. Sir George
was addressing a public meet-
ing at Rockhampton. He said
he had been in a quandary as
to the action he should take
after Deakin’s Ballarat speech,
“because, in any case, it looked
like simply jumping out of the
frying-pan into the fire.”
“My word,” interjected an
old man in the centre of the
hall, “the fat would have been
in the fire then, George!”
The crowd laughed itseif
hoarse, Sir George joining in
the merriment.
One other thing buried in
the recesses of my mind that
these reminiscenses have
stirred into activity relates to
the time, early in the life of the
Commonwealth, when Reid
fought a general-election cam-
paign on the Socialistic issue.
He painted a disturbing pic-
ture of conditions in Australia
should the Socialists secure
control. Political opponents
promptly daubed it “Reid’s
Anti-Socialistic Tiger,” and
lampooned it unmercifully.
They declared the trail of the
tiger was being used to obscure
the tracks of the Freetrade
pussyfoot.
I have often thought since
that Reid’s vision of the future
trend of political thought to-
wards Communism by Labor
extremists, and the necessity to
check it in its early stages, was
soundly based, but the electors
at the time would have none
of it, and Reid’s party was
decisively beaten.
Whatever may be said of
Reid’s brand of politics, he
always comported himself with
the innate dignity of a public
man, a quality in which, over
the years, many Federal poli-
ticians have been sadly lacking.
In fact, some of them today
appear to behave like irrespon-
sible political larrikins.
When the crisis was over and
Deakin had formed his second
Administration, he said that no
one was more surprised than he
when Reid took his Ballarat
speech as a “notice to quit.”
He told some journalists that
he had had no such intention.
Asa postscript to the refer-
ences to Deakin in these
two chapters. Professor Walter
Murdoch said, about a bio-
graphy he wrote some years
ago on Alfred Deakin:
“I made it plain in my book
that I thought of him as the
best and wisest man I had ever
known , the most scrupulously
honorable in all his doings and
the most entirely devoted to
the service of his country.”
Alfred Deakin was thrice
Prime Minister of Australia,
1903-4, 1905-6 and 1909. He
died in 1919 at the age of 63,

broken-hearted man.

based on the A.C.H. badge,
of which three versions were
then extant. The first and
second were as shown in The
Bulletin, while a third had
appeared with the words

heraldic “twist” of the two
earlier types. Gaunts were also
told that the badge had to in-
corporate the words “Aus-
tralian Commonwealth Military
Forces.”
went to England
"* between October, 1903, and
January, 1904, and while there
consulted Gaunts about the
badge. When he returned, Pea-
cock says, “he brought back
with him a blue velvet folder
containing specimens of
Gaunts’ production of the
badge, also some of the first
Commonwealth buttons.”
Proof that Gaunts made at
least the initial supply of this
badge was its inclusion in their
catalogue some years after-
wards. Bob Peacock sent a
photostat of the illustration to
Gaunts in 1938 and asked:
Was the badge made from draw-
ings executed by your own artists
or by designs brought from
Australia?
Gaunts, in their reply of
March 18, avoided a direct
answer. They said:
We remember quite well design-
ing this badge Our Mr. C. F.
Gaunt was in Australia about 1903
and he brought home to England
the particulars from which the
various designs were made.
White, at the time (1904)
A.D.C. to Hutton, says:
I am fairly certain that in this
year General Hutton fixed the
badge of the A.M.F. and that it
was an adaptation or variation of
the badge used by the Common-
wealth Horse.
There is no suggestion that
Cox Taylor or anyone else
other than Hutton and his
dress-committee played any
part in the production of this
badge. Hutton did not leave
Australia until November 21,
1904, by which time all details
of dress had been approved by
him and promulgated in
General Orders.
The next question is that of
the symbolism of the badges.
Does the rayed semi-circular
design represent a rising sun?
TAespite the various theories
that it does, there is at least
one good reason against this
concept. The reason lies in the
ancient, rigorous and inflexible
laws of British heraldry. All
of the recognised authorities
on this highly complex sub-
ject agree that the sun (always
referred to as “he” or “his”)
can be depicted:
“In his splendor” or “in his
glory,” i.e., a full disk or a segment
thereof with human face; shining
from behind a cloud; rising;
setting; a single ray.
In all cases, the intention
must be clearly specified in the
description or blazon. But the
important point is that the
heraldic method of indicating
the sun’s rays is invariably
to have them alternately
“straight and wavy”—as in,
for example, the crest in the
Arms of New South Wales,
described as “on a Wreath of
the Colors a Rising Sun, each
Ray tagged with a flame of
fire proper.” British Columbia
has another good example in
“a demi Sun in splendor
proper” ; South Australia has
“a Sun Or” (gold); Gilbert and
Ellice Islands “Gules (red)
issuant from water barry wavy
in base proper a Sun in
Splendor Or”; Nyasaland “a
Rising Sun Or on a Chief
Wavy Sable.” In each of these
variants the rays strictly follow
the heraldic rule of alternate
straight and wavy rays. All
rays, moreover, are of equal
length, as against the badges’
pattern of main and inter-
mediate points. Thus, the rays
on the badge bear no resem-
blance to the accepted heraldic
sun’s rays.
A novel, bui nonetheless
interesting, theory as to the
origin of the “Rising Sun”
nickname, is contained in a
minute (unfortunately anony-
mous) on the War Memorial
file. This states:
The origin of the reference to
the Rising Sun in the badge is, 1
think, due to the fact that till about
1906 the only building near Vic-
toria Barracks, Melbourne, was
Hoadley’s jam-factory, with its
well-known and universally adver-
tised brand of Rising Sun Jam.
The similarity of the badge of the
A.C.H. gave them in Melbourne
the satirical nickname of “Hoadley's
Horse” among the returned con-
tingents who were back in Vic-
toria at the time of the formation
of the A.C.H.
The theory may not be as
fanciful as appears on the sur-
face —especially as at one time
the Victorian Arms also incor-
porated a rising sun.
Finally, a word about the
theme of the badge in addi-
tion to Mullaney’s:—
The sun rising over the crown
of the Empire on which it never
sets.
Another version, put for-
ward by Brig.-General J. K.
Forsyth (Q.M.G. in 1919),
states:
The points... .are intended to
represent bayonets and swords, and,
surrounding or surmounting the
crown, indicate in a purely military
sense the support of the crown
(or Empire) by the bayonets and
swords (of) the Armed Forces of
the Commonwealth.
Yet a third version has it:
A young nation rising out of the
Southern Seas in defence of the
Crown.
In the absence of any docu-
mentary support, it must, I feel,
be admitted that both the
second and third versions are
more applicable to the situa-
tion and to Australia’s tradi-
tional role of support for the
Commonwealth. Mullaney’s
suggested theme holds nothing
peculiar to Australia.
YX/here, of course, all those
concerned with the design
and introduction of the badges
fell down on the job was in not
submitting their ideas to the
College of Heralds in order
that everything could be made
heraldically accurate, and a
proper blazon composed to
specify the intention. In Eng-
land every badge and button
of the three Services is, and
long has been, covered by a
description which leaves noth-
ing in doubt.
As things have turned out,
the doubt, and the riddles, of
our “Rising Sun” will probably
never be resolved.


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Cost of Air Travel
Still can’t agree with “Mugga
Way’s” contention that the
advantages to passengers of
cutting flight-times with jets
and supersonic airliners will
continue to be more than out-
weighed by higher fares. '
I think it’s fair to say that
although the capital-cost of
new transport - aircraft is
steadily increasing, their pro-
ductivity is increasing at an
even greater rate. For each £1
of capital spent on aircraft
today, the earning-power in
terms of potential seaLmiles
acquired is very much higher
than for the same £1 spent in
1945, and there seems no
reason why this trend should
not continue.
I lately saw some figures
which suggested that 80 of the
projected supersonic airliners,
cruising at about Mach 2,
would have a productivity of
about 300 of such present sub-
sonic aircraft as the Boeing
707 or the Douglas DCB. Bear-
ing in mind that their indi-
vidual capital-cost will probably
only be about double, this is a
fair dividend.
Concerning fares: When
some years ago it took six days
to come from the U.K. to Aus-
tralia by that most comfortable
aircraft the Short Flying Boat,
it cost, if I remember rightly,
about £lOOO single. Today you
can go from Perth to London
at a single tourist-class fare of
a little over £3OO.
The contention of the inter-
national airlines —and there
seems no reason to disagree
with it —is that supersonic air-
liners will allow for another
very marked reduction in fares
by virtue of their greatly in-
creased earning-power in rela-
tion to capital-cost, and I
understand that the airlines are
hoping for a sufficiently large
reduction to attract as potential
customers a whole new group
of people who currently can’t
afford to travel internationally.

Horrors of the Terrace
Can’t understand why
architect Gropius, quoted and
supported by “Kanimbla” (B.
14/10/’59), boosted terrace-
houses. There’s nothing half
so dreary as mile after mile of
these buildings. I’ve seen them
in Sydney, Brisbane, London
and in other towns in England
and France, and I can’t see
more than one point in their
favor.
Architecturally they are the
counterpart of an Army-
barracks or the hutments of an
Army-camp. Their one point
of superiority over the villas
of the “suburban sprawl” is
that you can put three —maybe
even four of them in the
space now occupied by a
single detached cottage.
They are, however, a won-
derful idea for the boys who
would draw rents from them
and live in a nice home on a
“Go! those accounts balanced yet , Benson ?”
large allotment well out of
sight of them.
What would have happened
if the Housing Commission
had started to spread these
objects of beauty( ?) all along
our streets? What a squeal
would have gone up from the
municipal councils! And they
would have had the full and
hearty support of all ratepayers
and residents. Y. Tope
(N.S.W.).
Profitable Preservation
It is unrealistic, we are told,
to preserve old buildings. But
is it? I can recall quite a few
European municipalities which
make a good thing out of it.
Thousands of Australians
must have visited Holland’s
Marken and Volepdam, and
can testify how old buildings
and the costumings of former
days can draw visitors. Para-
doxically, it seems the more
we’re engulfed in the modern
world the more we long for
the old things—the overdose
of “antique shoppes” under-
lines this.
Williamsburg, once the
capital of Virginia (U.S.A.),
and the oldest incorporated
town of that State (founded in
1699, and named after William
of Orange), is a classic
example of what can be done
with a town’s historic associa-
tions when the Government
lends a hand.
Its old homes have been
bought and restored; the
rooms have been refurnished in
period-styles; former owners
are allowed to live in the
houses rent-free for life, pro-
vided they are prepared to
show visitors through at speci-
fied hours. Newer buildings
have been demolished and
replaced by 17th- and 18th-
century types of architecture.
Though it isn’t insisted upon,
former owners still occupying
the houses are encouraged to
wear the costumes of 250 years
ago (or, anyway, of that style)
and even to drive through the
streets in carriages.
Make no mistake: the
restoration of Williamsburg
has been realistic enough to
put lots of money into its
citizens’ pockets nearly a
quarter-of-a-million tourists
visit the place each year.
It could be a profitable busi-
ness (given time) to preserve
existing old buildings like St.
Malo at Hunter’s Hill (Sydney),
even if the new expressway
which threatens them has to
take another course. Indeed,
Hunter’s Hill might in time
become a sort of pocket-
Williamsburg. It is beautifully
situated and has a number of
charming homes, some of them
not much younger than St.
Malo.
It would need to be made
into an “untouchable” historic
corner in the midst of bustling
modern progress where other
old buildings which have to
be pulled down could be re-
erected. Imaginative advertis-
ing, I believe, would soon
entice tourists there—that is, if
the Hill burghers want them.
And if it didn’t become a
paying proposition?
The vice-chancellor of Delhi
University lately reminded
A.B.C. listeners that Australia,
with a population of 10 million,
has a national income amount-
ing to more than half of that
of India with her 400 million.
If we’re that well-off, surely
we can afford to preserve and
restore our few buildings of
old-world grace and historic
background— Maitri (N.S.W.).
After Fifteen Years
The setting-up of the League
of Nations after War I and of
the United Nations after War
II is plain evidence that the
folly—indeed, the futility—of
trying to settle international
disputes by force have received
world-wide recognition. But
not, of course, by everybody.
Not, for instance, by certain
Communist Governments, and
not by the writer of “After
Fifteen Years” (B. 7/10/’59).
That writer rejects the idea
and the ideal of the settlement
of disputes between nations by
peaceful means. He could not
have been pleased to hear no
less a world figure than Earl
Attlee proclaim in a recent
A.B.C. broadcast his determi-
nation to continue to support
the aims and objectives of the
United Nations.
Nowhere does the writer of
“After Fifteen Years” acknow-
ledge that Australia was one
of the founding-members of
the U.N. and has been stead-
fast in its support ever since.
Many of “the plain busybodies
who haunt the huge flatiron
on the East River” are Aus-
tralians of whom their country
may well be proud.
It is true that the U.N.
General Assembly is a neutral
platform from which all may
speak ; and we should remem-
ber that from this platform—
and from it alone —Australian
representatives can address
themselves directly to 81 other
nations.
Of course the Communists
also use it; but how can it
be contended that there “they
can propagate ideas whilst
leaving those who receive them
deceived as to their source and
purpose”? The U.N. head-
quarters is indeed a “glass-
house” where nothing is hidden,
and there are no secrets in
any of its proceedings.
The League of Nations


Fatth In the
Future
As a young country seeking the friendly interest
of others, Australia has to face the fact that the world
knows too little about us, and about what we are doing.
The Australian story deserves to be told in louder,
-Clearer tones than we have so far attempted. And the
need for sounding it has grown in recent years since our
entry into a phase of investment-aided expansion.
Distinguished light on this subject has come from
the American Ambassador to Australia, Mr. William
J. Sebald. On a recent visit back in his own country
he found a “most generalised conception” of what
Australia is, and he suggested that on both sides of
the Pacific there was still a big job of explanation and
familiarisation to be done.
Now, this being true of two countries which have
so much in common in the British Commonwealth-
American partnership, how true must it obviously be
where it touches Australia’s relations with Asia?
Within the limits of resources that have been
made available, our informational agencies are
doing a very creditable job. Our documentary films
and Radio Australia broadcasts perform an
admirable service.
A splendid work in compiling and distributing
current surveys on Australia is being done by the
Commonwealth News and Information Bureau within
the Department of the Interior. The information it
puts out has become a powerful auxiliary to the
work of our diplomats and officials posted overseas.
These are some instances of what is being done in
official effort.
But I would like to see a more intensified approach
to the whole business of making Australia known
abroad ; and the responsibility for it, I believe, rests
not alone with Governments.
We must be articulate, and we should follow
this up with more personal contacts and informed
interchanges, realising that better understanding
can come only through mutual knowledge and
mutual acquaintance.
The Australian record is good. It will be better.
And the more we make our country, ourselves, and
our dispositions known to our neighbours, the better
the service we will be rendering to the world and
to ourselves.
failed mainly through lack of
membership. The U.S. never
took part in it, and such
members as Italy, Japan and
Russia withdrew. The U.N.
base of membership continues
to expand. Member-nations
are determined to remain, and
non-members have used all
possible influence to become
members. “After Thirty
Years’’ will no doubt be able to
report full membership—or no-
body will be reporting any-
thing anywhere.—G. W. L.
Townsend (Q.).
Fees in Church Schools
Apart from the principle—
adopted at the Duke of Edin-
burgh’s old school, Gordons-
toun —of having a sliding-
scale of fees for parents of
differing economic status,
there’s another method that
could help Australian church-
schools to counter the threat
of falling enrolments as a
result of fees becoming too
high (B. 28/10/’59). This is
educational insurance. Policies
are taken out while children are
still in babyhood to provide
most, if not all, the money
needed for school-fees.
This scheme has been in
vogue in the U.K. for a good
many years, and is no doubt an
important reason why, despite
high taxation and school-fees,
even the more expensive Eng-
lish public schools are showing
no signs of falling attendances.
—Morris the Tinker (N.S.W.)
Sport and Politics
Because of the importance
of the Olympic Games there
has been a continuous effort
since the war to involve the
International Olympic Com-
mittee in politics, and often
much misinformation is printed
about 1.0. C. policy.
Recently there were loud
wails from political forces
when the 1.0. C. meeting at
Munich debated what has be-
come known as the “Chinese
Olympic” problem. It was
written that the 1.0. C. had
ousted, or expelled, the Chinese
National Olympic Committee.
Political efforts to .force the
1.0. C. to change its attitude
did not succeed ; but they left
the air full of uninformed
opinion about the reason why
the 1.0. C. took its stand.
To clear the matter the
Munich conference fully de-
bated the question, and presi-
dent Avery Brundage sub-
sequently made a special
announcement. This is con-
tained in the official bulletin of
the Olympic Committee.
Brundage says, inter alia :
After the war the Chinese
National Olympic Committee which
had been in Nanking moved to
Taipei (Taiwan). In due time
another Olympic Committee was
formed in Nanking and was duly
recognised by the 1.0. C. After its
recognition the Peking committee
made demands for jurisdiction over
sport in Taiwan. This was refused
by the 1.0. C. because the Peking
committee could not exert authority
in Taiwan. As a result the Peking
committee refused to participate in
the 1956 Olympic Games and with-
drew last year from the Olympic
movement. At the meeting in
Munich it was pointed out that
if the Peking committee had no
jurisdiction in Taiwan it was equally
true that the Formosa committee
had no authority in China. It was
for this reason that the 1.0. C.
decided to inform the Chinese com-
mittee having its seat in Taiwan
that it could not be recognised as
having control of sport in China.
There was no pressure from
anyone the decision was prac-
tically unanimous. We cannot
recognise a Chinese committee in
Taiwan any more than we could
recognise an Italian committee in
Sicily or a Canadian committee in
Newfoundland. Furthermore, there
is nothing new about this question,
since already for the third Asian
Games in Tokyo last year the
athletes from Taiwan were notified
they could only participate as from
Formosa and not from China, and
they did so participate. If an
application for recognition under a
different name is made it will be
considered. The 1.0. C. recognises
only sports-organisations and not-
Governments, and has no intention
of departing from its basic policy
of no discrimination, either
religious, social or political.
As far as I know, this fair
and reasonable clarification
has not up to now had news-
paper publication in Australia.
—Politicus (N.S.W.).
Future of Formosa
Part of Communist China’s
current muscle-flexing is pro-
bably to remind Russia, among
others, that any consideration
of the world’s future must take
China’s policies and growing
strength into account. It may
be due partly to pique over
the use of the Chinese seat in
the U.N. and the Security
Council. It is doubtless due in
part to determination to secure
control over Formosa.
We don’t like this, nor does
the U.S. Mr. Casey has
pointed out that one of
Peking’s conditions for the
diplomatic recognition being
urged in so many quarters in
Australia and the U.S. is the
breaking-off of such relations
with the Nationalist Govern-
ment in Formosa. He added
that a consequence of recog-
nition would be a fundamental
breach of policy between Aus-
tralia and the U.S., which

would profoundly affect Aus-
tralian-American relations.
This can be acknowledged,
but it doesn’t get over the like-
lihood that China wall con-
tinue to get more and more
aggressive in its demands for
Formosa, with consequent
horrifying threats to world
peace.
The stark problem, therefore,
is whether we and the Ameri-
cans consider Chiang Kai-
shek’s crowd (as distinct from
the native Formosans) worth
all the growing fear and in-
creasing bloodshed which will
be involved in resisting the
Chinese demand, or whether
the Nationalist regime, led by
an ageing general and consist-
ing of ageing troops paid by
U.S. dollars, can be regarded
cold-bloodedly as expendable.
There are several answers to
this. The most obvious one is
that appeasement, even if we
were prepared to consider it,
would probably not pay any
dividend in view of the power-
plans in Peking. There are the
promises which have been
made to Chiang, and which are,
admittedly, a matter of
national honor. There is the
slowly-foundering Nationalist
belief that the Chinese people
will rise eventually against their
Communist leaders.
Yet if Formosa is the only
stumbling-block, or even the
major one, against some real
summit-conferences which
would include mainland China
and perhaps lead to China
becoming a more-or-less
amenable member of the
family of nations, can we
afford to neglect some con-
sideration of what should be
"done?
At the moment China is un-
compromising on Formosa,
and its attitude is backed by its
growing and formidable
strength, and apparently un-
affected by the seemingly
genuine Russian appeals for
moderation. Are the Western
nations going to make some
effort to come to terms with
China in this matter, offering
some formula which will open
the way, to negotiations and
include some kind of enforce-
able assurances?
Peking has lost a lot of face
in Asia in the last couple of
years, and doesn’t want to lose
more. It might welcome some
way of making the kind of
offers that are now coming
from Russia, thus regaining to
some degree the confidence of
its neighbors and securing the
cautious acceptance of the
West.
So far as Formosa is con-
cerned, time is on the side of
the Chinese, and they know it.
We should do something
promptly.— Charles Meeking

Classifying Plant-life
Can’t help doubting the
soundness of “A.C.T.’s” pre-
diction (B. 14/10/’59) that
“farmers, foresters and
gardeners will welcome the
decision made by the
A.N.Z.A.A.S. conference in
Perth to undertake a
£1,500,000 project for classify-
ing Australian plant-life.”
Firstly, I can’t imagine
present - day farmers and
others waxing excited over a
publication that won’t be
available within 20 years ; and
secondly, any such catalogue—
if it ever does emerge—will
probably be so cumbersome, so
academic and so costly as to
be a write-off for most men on
the land.
Anyway, where are the
botanists with time to do such
a big job? As the sponsors of
the proposal must know, such
workers are simply not avail-
able. In fact, the “decision”
as a whole strikes me as being
merely one of those resolu-
tions that the Science Con-
gress adopts from time to time
and never puts into effect. —-

with pieces of soft white bread.
His beard wagged as he chewed
the bread.
Michael decided that Neville
mightn’t, after all, be such a
monster as he had imagined.
This made him feel angry, but
then he was ashamed of his
anger.
He attempted conversation.
He looked at Neville and said
“You know, I was thinking
about beatniks this afternoon.
That’s what we are. Or sup
posed to be.”
“Who says so?” Neville
asked politely.
“Well, everyone.”
Neville produced a rather
crumpled pack of Turkish
cigarettes and offered them
round. Christine declined, but
Michael took one.
“You know, old boy, it
doesn’t matter a what
other people think.”
Was this a rebuke or purely
personal philosophy? Michael
preferred to think it was
philosophy. He drew on the
cigarette and something ex-
ploded inside his head. He felt
sick. To hell with the party!
To hell with Christine! To hell
with beatniks!
“Let’s go,” he said abruptly.
They got up and went to-
wards the cashier. Christine
wandered outside, and Neville
made a great show of searching
his pockets for money. He
seemed vaguely surprised but
thankful when Michael gave
the girl 30s. and waited for
the few shillings’ change.
Tt was sullen and dark outside,
and the street was wet. A
taxi zoomed past. They
walked in silence. At the
corner a group of bodgies
stared at them ; one wolf-
whistled at Christine.
“Bloody bodgies,” said
Neville. “Anti-social galahs.”
Christine said “Actually, he’s
rather cute.”
Michael said “What’s the
time?”
“Seven-twenty,” answered
Neville. “How about a beer?”
“Thought you were going to
the party?”
Christine said “Darlings,
we’re all going.”
They wandered across
College Street.
Michael said “Look, I don’t
think I’ll go. Got to work
tomorrow.”
Neville said, “Do you work,
old boy? How dreary.”
“Oh, leave him alone,” said
Christine. “If he wants to be
a square, well, let him.”
Michael said “I suppose,
when you wake up tomorrow
feeling like hell, you’ll con-
sider that the summit of”
“Shut up,” said Neville.
“You’ve made it plain you’re
not coming, so shoot through,
old boy.”
Michael suddenly wanted to
punch himbut in that
moment of coldly considered
anger Neville took Christine’s
arm and they both walked
away—over the street, leaving
Michael standing there;
Christine turned once and
shook her head, flashing a
dazzling smile.
It was nearly a quarter to
eight. Michael wandered un-
certainly down Castlereagh
Street. Groups of people,
“This will save us buying a new one."
chatting gaily, swept by him
on their way to the theatre, to
the pictures. He felt morose
and alienated. Heavily he
pushed open the door of the
corner pub and went in to the
bar.
It was just the way of it, he
reflected, gazing vacantly at the
tinny woodwork, the polished
brass all around him; this
society, of which he had never
really been a member—after
all, he worked : he studied art,
didn’t care much for coffee-
shop discussions —this society
swirled, it seemed to him,
purposelessly, artily, from party
to party. They always
countered the familiar ques-
tion —“Don’t you think you’re
wasting your time?” —with the
equally familiar reply: “Genius
emerges from groups such as
this.”
He finished the middy and
went out into the street and,
almost automatically, he found
himself in the lane leading to
the Alceon. Just one look,
he thought, to see if there's
anyone there; then I’ll go
home.
A depressing feeling asserted
itself: a feeling of not belong-
ing. He walked past the coffee-
lounge, glanced in ; yes, four
or five. He continued slowly
down the lane. And then some-
one caught him roughly by the
arm.
A/Tichael swung violently,
and his right arm curved
to deliver a punch, but the
voice said “Don’t you try
that.”
At the same time the grip
on his arm increased. It was
a New Australian: short and
stocky, shirtsleeves, slightly
drunk.
Michael said “Let go of me.
What do you want?”
The New Australian’s eyes
went wild. His grip was begin-
ning to hurt “Look here, I
am shopkeeper in dis street,
now why you overturn dust-
bins?”
.“Dustbins?” said Michael.
“What are you talking about?”
In one swift movement he
wrenched himself away from
the grip. The New Australian
lurched. He closed and un-
closed his hands.
“Some time tonight I am not’
here, but when I am back
again, the dustbins . . . the
dustbins ... I know you, you
one of those larrikin boys from
Alceon, now you clean up
mess from dustbins.”
He advanced, and Michael
began to panic.
Everything was quiet. The
New Australian started again ;
he was almost crying in angry
anguish. “Clean up .. .
larrikin . . . you spilt dust-
bins . . .**
But a car pulled-up and
someone sprang out. No, three
got out. Neville and two others.
Michael felt relief flooding over
him.
Neville strolled over. “What’s
the trouble?” he said.
“Dustbins ... I know this
larrikin . . . the dustbins. See
for yourself.”
He gestured down, the lane,
and dimly the grotesque shapes
of overturned bins could be
seen, lying crazily in the gutter.
“He will clean”
“Just a minute,” said Neville.
“Now, my friend here has been
with me all night. He has not
touched your bins. You under-
stand? Not touched them.”
The New Australian’s mouth
twisted and he moved forward
Neville restrained him with
one hand. “Just a minute. I
will call a policeman. I will
prove to you my friend has
nothing to do with it.”
This piece of bluff, thought
Michael, won’t work.
But the New Australian, at
the mention of police, backed
away. He was still very angry.
Neville said softly “Get into
the car. I’ll handle this galah.”
Neville’s two friends made
way for Michael as he turned
towards the car. And Christine
was inside.
It was over in a few minutes.
The New Australian, gesticu-
lating, moved away. Neville
and the other two came back to
the car.
Christine said “Darlings,
how terribly exciting.”
And Michael, although he
felt grateful to Neville, could
not bring himself to say any-
thing ; he was still smarting
from Neville’s earlier behavior.
But he needn’t have worried.
Neville solved everything. As
they sped down the lane and
turned cautiously into Pitt
Street, Neville said casually
“Michael, old boy, meet two
friends. They’re coming to the
party with us.”
And, as he changed gear,
“By the Way, I’ve forgotten
exactly how to get to Pete’s
place. Perhaps you could help
there?”
He grinned, and Christine
laughed, and Michael, for
some reason, couldn’t help
smiling himself.

HOW TO RECOGNISE IDENTICAL TWINS
By W. G. WHITTLESTONE
“O ecognition of identical
twins is important for any
research-worker who’s trying
to build a herd of twins for
experimental purposes. Some-
times it can be important for
quite reasons, too.
Many years ago I lived in the
same boarding-house as one
of a pair of human identical
twins (female), the other of the
pair living in a town some 30
miles away. One of my friends
was courting the local twin,
but could not tell the difference
between the girls by appear-
ances, so was often the victim
of a joke when the sister came
along.
Then, as years went by,
differences of environment
began to make the girls differ-
ent. Their manner of speech
changed, though they persisted
in wearing identical clothes.
I’m sure, though I was never
able to try the experiment, that
the development of different
reflexes must have made the
A new finishing pro-
cess for 100 per cent,

property of crease-
retention has been
introduced in England.
The process also gives
garments a measure of
resistance to unwanted
creases, and it is claimed
that treated cloth will
stand up to wear and
dry - cleaning much
better than untreated
garments. Lamb pro-
ducers everywhere know
the advantages derived

siderably less risk of

girls somewhat different; the
results of trying to woo the
wrong twin would, I think,
become evident after a few
critical stimuli had been
applied. This is very evident
in animals which, though
identical in responses at the
beginning of an experiment,
quickly become different as a
result of conditioning.
In other words, animals
which are identical when
young become different if
placed in different environ-
ments.
With identical cattle it is
fascinating to see a herd of
identical twins at pasture.
They tend to get around
together, and if you watch
them grazing you will find the
pairs are remarkaby similar in
habits. If one is a selective
grazer, the other will be the
same ; if one goes round like
a lawnmower, eating every-
thing, so will the other.
You will also notice, if the
animals are a year or so old,
that their coat-colors are
similar, the patterns of mark-
ing will be very alike and the
whorls of hair on the face and
poll will look roughly the
same.
It gives you a funny feeling
to see a herd of identical
heifers —it’s a bit like the effects
of a wild party, except that
only the cattle are double!
There is rarely any doubt
about recognising older cows
as identical twins ; it is much
harder to recognise calves a
few days old. However, Dr.
Hanccck (who used to be at
Ruakura) has developed a
technique for identifying twins
as calves.
Because it is so fascinating
and important, I would like
to say a little about how Dr.
Hancock identified his animals.
He was so good at it that once
he took-on a collection of
calves blindfolded and recog-
nised most of the twin pairs in
the little herd!
The secret in detecting twins
is to look for differences. The
first thing which strikes you
when you look at a herd of
twins is the similarity. How-
ever, to be sure that a pair of
young twins is identical,
differences should be noted;
they are more important than
similarities.
There are some points more
important than others, so it will
be useful to go over some
of the more obvious charac-
teristics of young cattle in
order to determine the best
guides in finding identical sets.
I mention this, because I
hope that some day some of
my readers will be inspired to
keep an eye open for twin sets.
We hope in the future to
build-up a herd of such
animals at the University
Farm, for research purposes.
The first point you notice
about an animal is its size.
This is not useful as a guide
in looking for identical twins.
As the environment in the
mother may have been differ-
ent from the nutritional point
of view, identicals may be just
as different in size as
fraternals.
Next you generally notice
the shape or conformation of
the body—the head-shape in
particular—and a good stock-
man will quickly pick differ-
ences and similarities. Con-
formation is the first clue, but
a hard one to describe ; it takes
experience.
One of the interesting decora-
tions on the cow is the hair-
whorl. Some of these are as
striking as the products dis-
played by the human female
after a session with the
beautician, except that they are
natural and tend to be in-
herited.
There are five main types
of whorl in the bovine female,
and they occur on various parts
of the body. The two com-
monest whorls on the calf are
the “star” and the “nebula.”
Next comes the “fountain,”
while the rare ones are the
“centipede” and the “feather.”
These names are probably
descriptive enough for you to
picture them.
There are considerable
differences between identical
twins with respect to kind and
position of whorls. When the
whorls are of the rare types
and are identically placed this
is a good guide, but don’t take
too much notice of the popular
types.
The color of the skin is one
of the best guides in looking
for identicals. Unfortunately
the young calf still has a birth-
coat on, but a little experience
will deal with that. By run-
ning the hand against the
direction of the hair in a good
light it is possible to get a fair
idea of the color underneath.
There are, however, parts of
the body where there isn’t
much hair, and these should
be examined first. The colors
in the mouth are a useful
guide. Similar spotted or
colored areas on the palate
and tongue are a strong clue;
particularly if they are of an
unusual type. An even better
clue is the color of the lower
jaw; identical twins usually
have identical colors in this
part.
The same goes for the pig-
ments in the ears. Any notice-
able differences between ear
colors strongly suggests that
the twins are not identical.

are differences in the pattern
of color on the udders, but if
one has pigment and the other
hasn’t, then they’re probably
only fraternals.
Hair color is a property
which is inherited through a
fair number of genes. It is a
good guide ; so, using the trick
of running the hand against
the hair, it’s possible quite
quickly to detect differences in
young twins.
White spots or markings on
the forehead may vary quite
a lot between identical
animals and so are not a very
good guide. On the other
hand, if eyelashes are different
in color the twins are probably
fraternal.
Some overseas workers have
regarded the muzzle-print as
important. It is taken the
same way as a fingerprint, but
it’s a bother to make, and is
unreliable in the light of Dr.
Hancock’s findings.
Some workers have suggested
that spare or supernumerary
teats are a good guide, but
again the New Zealand studies
have not found this much
good as a criterion.
Sometimes there are anato-
mical differences between twins
caused by some sort of
abnormal growth. A case in
point is the twisted face. A
pair of twins may look quite
different because one has a
twisted face, but this could
have been caused by position
in the uterus during develop-
ment, and the animals may be
identical. Hancock has shown
this to be true of “undershot
jaw”—a defect sometimes
found in cattle.
When the calves have
grown-up and lost their birth-
coats it is much easier to see
if they are identical —though
by this time it is a bit expen-
sive to find that one has made
a mistake!
The pattern of the escutcheon
is very useful in looking for
differences ; so also is the final
coat-color pattern.
It’s also worth mentioning
that, if twins have been in
different environments, they
will look different. For
example, animals kept indoors
tend to fade in color. State
of nutrition and the effects of
lactation can also influence the
appearance of an animal, so
these points must be remem-
bered when looking at grown
animals.
From what I have said it will
be evident that detecting iden-
tical twin calves isn’t really
hard. At the start, you have
to go over all the points men-
tioned, watching for differ-
ences, but after a while a rapid
examination for detail, fol-
lowed by looking at the animals
side by side and concentrating
on differences, will quickly
show whether they are identical
or not.
I hope that some readers
will have a chance to try the
methods described; when we
get into the twin-business, we
will need some practical
helpers on the farm.
Mudgee FSeece Show
Mudgee Legacy is holding
its second annual fleece-show
on November 20-21.
Secretary John Stevenson
reports “very good entries” and
hopes to see a respectable roll-
up from other N.S.W. wool-
districts.
An annual fleece-show at
Mudgee could well grow into
something of more -than
regional importance. Certainly
the district has a wealth of
fine - wool tradition. It was
around Mudgee thafj the great
studs of the 1820’s were estab-
lished —among them, George
Cox’s Burundulla, parent of a
flock of famous studs, includ-
ing Havilah, James Walker’s
L.U.E., and others.
Apart from this historic-
interest, a couple of days at
Mudgee can be a veify pleasant
experience, by all accounts.
And there is certainly some-
thing to be said for well-known
wool - centres conducting their
own fleece-shows.
Herd Recording
“North”: Until lately most
dairyfarmers in Queensland
kept no records of their herds,
and so could never judge
individual production. The
few who did keep records did
better with fewer milkers than
their happy-go-lucky neigh-
bors. One increased his cows’
average from 1131 b. to 2181 b.
butterfat in four years. Not
everyone could expect to do
this, but even a 10 per cent,
increase would be worth
while
By means of herd-recording
a farmer can discover the pro-
duction of each cow, so that
low producers can be culled
and profitable cows used for
breeding, while the higher
production of their progeny
improves the average of the
herd.
For some years there has
been a Queensland Depart-
ment of Agriculture recording-
officer to assist each group of
farmers keeping herd-records.

His duty is to weigh, sample
and test milk from each cow
in the herd and enter particu-
lars in the farmer’s record-
book. More than 1200 dairy-
men are now taking advantage
of this service.
Once they know the per-
formance of their cows most
farmers start feeding the herd
to improve production. An
animal capable of producing
3501 b. butterfat annually will
fall short of that quantity
unless fed enough.
Pasture-improvement, fodder-
conservation and better herd-
management all help ; so does
the feeding of concentrates
with roughage during milking.
Selection of a bull for herd-
improvement is most important.
Choose one with good produc-
tion-potential, and assess its
worth when its daughters
complete their first lactation —-
comparing their production
with that of other cows in the
herd. Farmers are showing
increased interest in sire-
surveying each year. In 1956
only 60 requests for surveys
were made ; this increased to
250 in 1959.
1959 Orange
Field Days
The Orange Field Days are
being held this year from
Tuesday to Thursday, Novem-
ber 17-19, on R. K. Gordon’s
property, The Triangle— 2\
miles from Orange—and C.
Sommerville’s orchard which
adjoins it.
Many manufacturers —from
inter-State and from N.S.W.
country towns, as well as from
Sydney—are exhibiting under
their own names this year,
to allow more comparative
demonstration of their equip-
ment than might have been
possible if displayed by agents.
Orange farm-machine and
farm - chemical agents are
setting-up their own blocks
again, close to those of the
manufacturers, but featuring
other products they carry for
"Come awa', Angus — t ’ wireless is sayin' she's gangin
t' doomp her fuel!”
which manufacturers have not
taken separate display-space.
Throughout the three days
a continuous film-programme
will be shown, covering aspects
of primary production which
cannot be demonstrated prac-
tically: the plan is to supple-
ment the teaching and know-
ledge exemplified in practical
field demonstrations. A differ-
ent programme will be shown
every day.
Great emphasis is again being
placed on the section devoted
to machines devised by private
primary producers to suit
individual needs and made with
their own welding equipment.
Entries have been invited from
farmers who have evolved an
appliance made of welded
material which allows them to
do any job better. Such a
competition allows individual
farmers to pass on ideas which
are useful, and this year there
is an increased award offered
by the Lincoln Electric Co., in
conjunction with Bulk Supplies,
Ltd. (that company’s Orange
agents). “Post” entries for
this competition will be
accepted on the first day,
November 17, but advice of
intended entries is already
being received.
Three separate organisations
will demonstrate fertiliser-
spreading from aircraft, and
officers from the N.S.W.
Department of Agriculture will
give technical demonstrations
on pest-identification, post-
mortem examination and
advanced techniques in
orcharding.
Grain Sorghum
“Van”: Grain-sorghum is
nearly equal to wheat as feed
for poultry, but for chickens
it should not form more than
15 per cent, of their ration.
Experiments at the Govern-
ment farm at Seven Hills,
Blacktown (N.S.W.), show that
it’s toxic for chickens in higher
quantities.
Unfortunately, grain - sor-
ghum matures at the same time
of year as Bathurst-burr. Many
crops sown on poorly prepared
seedbeds are thick with this
burr, and, when stripped, carry
a high percentage of it.
Growers of sorghum heavily
infested with burr will say that
fowls grind anything up and
do well on the oil in the burr —
the fact is that it’s against the
law to sell grains containing
noxious weeds.
Recently the N.S.W. De-
partment of Agriculture issued
a warning to poultrymen not
to buy sorghum with more
than 5 per cent. Bathurst-burr
in it, experiments having
shown that it affected fowls
adversely, especially in egg-
production.
Potatoes
“MyallV: In southern
Queensland and the coastal belt
of N.S.W. the spring crop of
potatoes should be planted
from June to September, and
the autumn crop from mid-
January to the end of Feb-
ruary. Planted during these
periods, maturing tubers are
not affected by humid weather.
Further south, where only
one crop is grown, August to
October is the usual planting-
time, but in very cold districts
November is early enough.
Though frost cuts the young
plants they soon grow afresh,
without ill-effects. In fact,
many growers claim that
frosted plants yield better than
those which escape.
Land intended for potatoes
must be well drained and
thoroughly prepared. The crop
does best in deep, rich, friable
loams, rather light than other-
wise, but good yields are
harvested from most soils
except heavy, clayey land. The
ground must be deeply
ploughed and brought to a
good tilth by scarifying and
harrowing. The crop does well
on land with a high organic
content, supplied by turning-in
large quantities of rotted farm-
yard manure or legumes in
their green state.
Prepared balanced fertilisers
may either be spread thinly
over the field and ploughed-in
or sprinkled in the bottom of
the furrow at the rate of 141 b.

manure should be used in the
same manner.
Get seed-potatoes from
reliable sources and discard any
showing signs of disease.
Spread them out in a cool, airy
shed to green and develop
strong, healthy shoots. For the
June-September crop both
small and large tubers can be
planted, but for the summer
planting the smaller ones are
best, because the hot soil may
cause the “cut” sets to rot.
When cutting large tubers see
that each portion contains at
least two “eyes,” and dip the
cut areas in fresh wood-ashes
or lime which forms a hard
crust and makes rotting less
likely.
It takes between scwt. and
Bcwt. of seed to plant an acre,
with the furrows spaced 30in.
apart. Furrows should be at
least 6in. deep, with “sets”
spaced at about Min. Fill
the furrows and give the field a
harrowing. Light, sandy soils
will benefit from a light rolling
as well. Keep weeds down and
the soil between the rows open
and loose.
When the potatoes are 6in.
high start hilling, repeating
when the plants are 9in. high
and again when about Min.
Hilling prevents light getting
to the developing tubers and
turning them green.
When the haulms turn
yellow, the “new” potatoes are
ready for lifting and should be
consumed or marketed quickly.
If potatoes are needed for
storing allow the tops to die
right down. Bag as soon as
possible after digging, other-
wise cover the tubers with
sacks to exclude the light.
Store in a dry shed, covering
with straw or other material
(never more than 5 tons in one
heap, or they may sweat and
deteriorate).
Worst pest is the potato-
moth, so use new sacks or dip
secondhand bags in boiling
water to destroy any pupae,
larvae or eggs. When bagged,
cart to storage immediately ; if
left in the field overnight
thousands of eggs will be laid
by the moths, and these hatch
in a few days, causing heavy
losses.
• Treatment of tubers may be
done when bagging. Put a
small handful of 2 per cent.
D.D.T.-powder into the bottom
of a kerosene-tin, fill with
tubers, tip them into the bag,
sprinkle about |lb. powder over
the filled bag, then sew-up.
Infested stored potatoes
should be treated with carbon-
bisulphide at the rate of 41b. to
each 100 cu.-ft. of the con-
tainer. This liquid is inflam-
mable, so don’t smoke or use
naked lights near it.
Fat Beef Out of Favor
[From the “Keview of the River
Plate,” Buenos Aires.]
“The seriousness of the diffi-
culties affecting Argentina’s
cattle-raising industry and
meat-trade is reflected in almost
any series of statistical com-
parisons that one cares to cite.
“As was mentioned recently,
the drop in cattle-sales for
slaughtering in the first four
months of 1959 was of the
order of 45 per cent., as com-
pared with the pertinent data
for the same period of last
year.
“Shipments of chilled-beef to
the U.K. —to take another
example—are down by an
approximately similar margin.
Cattle-market prices, however,
are between three and four
times higher than those ruling
a year ago, indicating condi-
tions of cattle shortage that are
the root of the trouble. Finally
—and less depressingly—a com-
parison of the composition of
cattle-sales in recent months
encourages the opinion that the
price-system is performing its
beneficial function, in that
sales of breeding-animals show
a satisfactory reduction below
the ruinously high level which
was so disquieting a feature of
earlier returns.
“This latter and more hope-
ful symptom may seem to indi-
cate that the beef-cattle short-
age is in process of rapid repair
and that before long a satis-
factory recovery will begin to
be apparent in the meat-export
trade, favored by a substantial
reduction in internal beef-con-
sumption due to the rise in
retail prices and consequent
increased availability of sup-
plies for export.
• “Dietitians have probably
helped the trend of preference
for leaner beef, and antipathy
to animal-fats, with their widely
proclaimed theories about the
harmful effects on human
health of the cholesterol
content of the latter. And no
doubt there are sundry other,
more or less relevant, con-
siderations. The main con-
sideration, however, is that
Argentine beef-cattle produc-
tion must once more be adapted
to the necessity implicit in the
recognition that the customer
is always right. It will be
recalled that some 10 years ago,
under the same necessity, the
30-months-old steer weighing
530 . kilogrammes (live-weight)
had to make way for a
younger, lighter type—a two-
year-old steer of 430 kilo-
grammes—which in turn, how-
ever, is now considered too fat
for the consumer’s taste.”
New Early Medic
“Sundowner”: A new medic,
particularly suitable for the
Mallee areas of Victoria, has
been developed at the Walpeup
(Vic.) research-farm and named
Harbinger.
Harbinger is notable for
rapid early growth, and it
produces seed 14 days earlier
than the standard commercial
strain of barrel-medic. These
characteristics are important,
because earlier growth
advances the period of ade-
quate paddock-feed for stock,
particularly when other forms
of grazing are not plentiful,
and the earlier seed-set should
ensure persistence in the
shorter growing-season of the
Mallee country.
Harbinger medic seeds very
freely and, although individual
burrs are small, the total
weight of burr in proportion
to dry-matter is high. In
tests at Walpeup, Harbinger
produced as much total dry-
matter an acre as barrel-medic
173, and a slightly higher per-
centage of burr to total dry-
matter.
Comparisons also showed
that the new medic isn’t
inferior to barrel - medic in
producing dry-burr as paddock-
feed for sheep. A laboratory
analysis proved similarity
between the nutritive value of
herbage, seeds and burrs in the
two species.
It is expected that seed of
the new medic will be generally
available after the 1960 harvest.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(29/10/’59)
Queensland should have general rains during November,
with heavy falls and flooding in the central and northern
coastal districts and the central-western and south-western
areas. Good rains should continue in December, with further
heavy falls on the north-coastal districts, the Peninsula and
the north-western and south-western areas.
N.S.W. should also have widespread rains in November,
with heaviest falls on the n.-w. slopes and plains and the
central tablelands, as well as on the central-western and
south-western districts. Flooding may occur in much of
the State. Moderate to good rains are likely in December,
although there may be heavier falls in the southern divisions.
Victoria should receive fairly heavy rains during
November, with widespread flooding. Heaviest rains are
likely in the east-central and north-eastern districts.
Rainfall may vary from moderate to good during December,
although the Mallee and Wimmera may get only light rain.
Reasonably good rains are likely in South Australia
during November, but apart from moderate rain in the
upper and lower north, rainfall may be patchy in December.
The s.-w. agricultural areas of Western Australia should
receive good rains during November, although rainfall may
be poor elsewhere and December may well be mainly dry.

Recipe for peach-whip ?
Prepare some thick peach puree
by rubbing tinned or stewed peaches
through a sieve, and using as little
of the syrup as possible. Sweeten
to taste, and add a squeeze of
lemon-juice and a drop or two
of red coloring such as cochineal.
To each large cupful of the puree
allow two whites of eggs beaten
very stiffly. Fold them into the
puree lightly, and pile-up the whip
in individual glasses for serving.
Serve sponge-fingers or fancy-
biscuits separately. Other fruit-
purees can be . used in the same
way, and a topping of whipped
cream helps.

Is there a historical society in
S.A. ?
There is no historical society
proper in S.A., but the Royal
Geographical Society of Australia,
South Australian Branch, was
formed at a meeting held on July
10, 1885, and the society publishes
matenai dealing with the history of
exploration. In November, 1947, a
historical division was established
in association with this society for
the purpose of extending the
organisation’s work on the history
of S.A. The Pioneers’ Association
of S.A., founded in 1935, has pub-
lished a considerable number of
papers dealing mainly with the
history of S.A. pioneers.

Some information about the town
of Southern Cross ?
It is in the south-west of W.A.,
241 miles by rail east of Perth,
140 miles west of Kalgoorlie and
1157 ft. above sea-level. The name
was given to the district by two
prospectors, T. R. Risely and M.
Toomey, who in 1888 were directed
to a line of hills which they were
told they would find by going
slightly to the east of the Southern
Cross. Finding gold there, they
named the field after the constella-
tion. Several mines were quickly
established, and Southern Cross
soon became the centre of the
Yiigarn fields. In September, 1892,
Arthur Bayley made a rich find
at Coolgardie—lls miles to the

How to make pig’s-head brawn ?
Wash and clean a pickled head
carefully. Put it into a saucepan
with cold water to cover it and
bring slowly to the boil. Skim and
add some carrot, turnip and onion
cut in pieces and a small bunch
of flavoring-herbs. Simmer until
the flesh slips easily from the bones
•—about three hours—and skim
when necessary. When ready, lift
the head onto a dish, strain the
liquid into a basin and leave until
the following day, when the meat
from the head should be cut into
small pieces and all skin, gristle
and superfluous fat trimmed.
Remove all fat from stock, put it
back in the saucepan with the bones
and boil until well reduced. Strain
over the meat, add necessary
seasoning and, when slightly cooled,
pour into wet moulds.
Brief Answers
H.N.: The first airman to make
successful long-distance flights in
Australia was undoubtedly J. J.
Hammond, who flew demonstration-
flights in a Bristol on behalf of the
British and Colonial Aircraft Com-
pany. He arrived in Australia in
December, 1910... .P.G.: Largest
of the Free Churches in Britain
(formerly more generally known as
the Non-conformist Churches) is
the Methodist Church, the product
of a union of Methodist Churches
in 1932. It has threequarters of
a million adult full-members....
M.L.G.: Depends on the protein-
content of the roughage. With low
protein-roughage, and comparing
results of an amount of lucerne-
hay or grain providing equal
amounts of energy, the lucerne-hay
would give better results because of
the greater amount of protein
supplied.. . .E.M.: The township
of Toukley (N.S.W.) is situated on
Tuggerah Lakes, not on Lake Mac-
quarie. Lake Macquarie and
Swansea are within the geographical
range of Norah Head —i.e., roughly
18 miles, but due to jutting land
it is doubtful whether the light can
be seen... .J.W.T.: The highest
known weight for a turkey-gobbler
is 831 b. This bir-d was exhibited at
a contest conducted by the
“Turkey World Newspaper,”
U.S.A., about three years ago. No
authentic record weight for a
Merino ram has been determined.
Weights of up to 2501 b. for Merino
rams in wool have been recorded.

Reeling
Many years ago this reviewer
was travelling late at night in a
suburban train, the only other
occupants of his compartment
being four merchant-seamen,
one of whom approached him
and asked politely whether he
had any objection to “the
pipes.”
As it was a smoking-compart-
ment, reviewer was rather sur-
prised at the courtesy and told
them to go right ahead and
light-up. He then resumed
reading his book.
His ears have never been
the same since. No one can
really claim to have heard the
bagpipes until he has travelled
with them in a small railway-
carriage with the doors and
windows shut, making it
equally impossible for either
him or the music to escape.
This experience stood the
reviewer in good stead recently
when he put Coronet’s KEP
213 Pipes and Diums of the
48th Highlanders of Canada
on his record-player and
turned-up the volume-control.
Lacking the reviewer’s early
training, his family fled the
room, leaving him alone with
the 48th, who, after he had
induced them to pipe-down a
bit, treated him to a fine col-
lection of marches, jigs and
reels.
There’s nothing bigoted
about these Canadian pipers.
They put everything they’ve got
into “Mackay’s Farewell,” the
“Lady Loudon” Strathspey,
“The Soldier’s Return” and
“The Skye Boat Song,” but
they don’t stint the skirls when
asked to play “The Liverpool
Hornpipe,” and they couldn’t
put more abandon into
“Paddy’s Irish Breeches” if
their bags were filled with free
air from Connemara.
J. B.
Mathis and Mulligan
Because of its evanescent
nature, extemporised jazz is
rather hard to describe ; such
music, at its best, tends to
break-up into a series of bril-
liant little episodes. The going
is much easier with, say, pop.-
singers, and one is glad to
report that Johnny Mathis is
both easy on the ear and fairly
easy to describe.
Coronet has issued a Mathis
disk titled simply Heavenly
(KLP 815); the reason for
this particular title becomes
clear when you study the line-
up of songs, variously stress-
ing Paradise, a rainbow, moon-
light (but no sputniks), and
dreams, which, while not
altogether heavenly, are not
entirely earthly, either.
With Mathis you start with
the dictum “This boy can
sing! ” and work on from there.
It's rather a pity that the
orchestra] backing on this disk
is disappointing in its over-
emphasised lushness —but at
least they keep the beat.
Mathis has an outstanding
technique which is almost, but
not quite, hidden under the
variety of effects he produces.
Except for the occasional
mangled vowel-sound he is
pleasantly fresh in clarity of
enunciation and gentleness of
approach. In “A Ride on a
Rainbow,” one of the gentlest
numbers in this collection, he
sweeps twice to high-tenor
level and sustains these notes
beautifully; and he gets the
same soaring effect in the
following song, “More Than
You Know.” This is one of
the points of technique never
quite submerged; and so is
the ease with which he leaps
to a distant note and then
tumbles unerringly back to it.
The second side opens with
the blue beat of “Misty”; and
“Stranger in Paradise,” not-
withstanding the dubious pro-
nunciation of “hand,” sums-up
all the Mathis vibrancy and
warmth. Other songs are
“Moonlight Becomes You”
(i.e., suits you), “They Say It’s
Wonderful,” “I’ll Be Easy
to Find,” “That’s All,”
“Heavenly,” “Hello, Young
Lovers,” and “A Lovely Way
to Spend an Evening.”
The Gerry Mulligan Quartet
isn’t as easy to define. There
are degrees of skill in extem-
porised playing, and it’s all too
easy to hear Brubeck or
Goodman and imagine them to
be the ultimate. By compari-
son, Mulligan (who is an
extremely supple saxophonist)
is a chamber-music technician ;
he does not achieve the same
contrasts as Brubeck ; the play-
ing is neat, sometimes fastidi-
ous ; and the sax. is inclined
to take the limel i g h t—
although, in a quartet, the
range of contrast as far as
tone-colors go is rather limited.
This is a 45-r.p.m. disk
(KEP 204), and it opens with
“As Catch Can,” introduced
with a swirling rubato beat
which gradually accelerates;
the pirouetting trumpet throws
itself around, and through, the
drums and bass. Suddenly
Mulligan’s sax. takes-over —a
florid improvised passage—
and then the bass has a
descending scalal break, inter-
rupted by chords, then
trumpet and sax., then drums.
Back to the original melody,
this time even more decorated,
particularly by the rapid bass.
In “Utter Chaos” there is a
prominent sax. part, flowing
and leaping grumpily (but
expertly) and a deliberate 4/4
beat—nothing chaotic about
the way Mulligan plays. The
reverse side is entirely taken-
up with “What is There to
Say,” and after a pensive
initial statement the double
beat reduces to half. Tons
of sax.

Women's Letters
SYDNEY
Film-stars came and went, and parties
were given for them. Piquant Anne
Baxter won all who met her with her
complete naturalness and freedom from
the tantrums which are usually labelled
temperament. Apart from her obviously
sincere liking of our country, she con-
siders Australian cream, biscuits and beer
to be the best in the world. Perhaps
another name instead of Devonshire
could be coined for those delectable
afternoon-teas? Solomon in all his glory
will be shown in a film which United
Artists claim will outrival the great De
Mille Biblical productions of the past,
and in which emphasis is given to the
love-story of that King and the Queen of
Sheba. It’s to be hoped Sydney’s weather
will improve in time for the elaborate
“ballyhoo” which is to be the curtain-
raiser to the film’s release, for this is to
include a procession with Roman
chariots. Also, Sheba is to take her
bath in asses’ milk, and if anyone has
either chariots, she-asses or round bath
stacked away at home a plea for their
use goes out.

A very delightful party was given by
Miss Margaret Gillespie at the Forum
Club last week to celebrate the 10th
birthday of the Lunch Time Music Club,
of which she was the founder. She
was assisted by Mrs. Gordon Henty and
Lady Davidson, whose husband, the late
Sir Alfred Davidson, helped get the
club started. Guest-of-honor was Mrs.
Nicolai Malko, wife of Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestra conductor. During the
afternoon a programme of operatic arias
was given by scholarship winner Patricia
Wooldridge, and Rosemary Marriott,
John Serge and Robert Coleman,
winners of Sydney De Vries prizes also
given by the club at this year’s eisteddfod.
Pianist was Gwen Aldis. Among those
who enjoyed the party (and the delicious
birthday-cake, decked with 10 candles)
were Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Beattie,
Lady Berryman, Mrs. Charles Moses,
Mrs. E. R. H. Merewethcr, Mrs. W. J
Dakin, Mrs. A. F. Hamilton, Mrs. J. W.
Crawford, Mrs. Frank Lamb and Mrs.
F. P. Evans. The last-named was a
foundation-member of the club, which
consisted mainly of women who had
studied music in Vienna and Paris and
with Miss Gillespie had been pupils of
De Vries, who came to Sydney as a
teacher at the Conservatorium in 1938.

In the first-night audience for “The
Merchant of Venice” at the Theatre
Royal was Adelaide visitor Mrs. Cornell,
whose love of Shakspeare is such that
she has followed the J.C.W. company on
its tour to attend all opening productions.
She looked very attractive in a modified
trapeze-coat of duck-egg-blue taffeta.
Women theatregoers were loud in their
praise of the beautiful dresses worn by
Elaine Montgomerie in her role of
Portia, especially the rose-pink and
silver one, and the heart-shaped fan she
waved so elegantly in the pick-a-box
scene. The fashions of that day cer-
tainly suited the taller woman.
Happy smiles come readily to youthful
singer Patricia Wooldridge, whose lyric-
soprano voice has won for her the Sydney
De Vries Memorial Scholarship to the
Conservatorium, awarded each year by
the Lunch Time Music Club. She was
also among winners at Ballarat’s South
Street competitions, and has already
gained her D.S.C.M. at Sydney Con., as
well as L.Mus.A. and A.Mus.A. in both
singing and pianoforte. Patricia lives
at St. Leonard’s with her parents, Mr.
and Mrs. F. E. Wooldridge, both of
whom are also musically gifted. Her
English-born father sang as a boy in
Southampton Cathedral; her mother,
before marriage, was a Miss Morris, of
Picton. Patricia, who teaches music at
A bbotsleigh Girls’ School, intends to con-
tinue her studies in Sydney, but later
would like to go overseas. She has made
a number of radio-recordings and broad-
casts, and has also appeared on TV.

• Interesting sidelights on her job on
Prime Minister Macmillan’s war-time
staff at Field-Marshal’s H.Q. in Italy
came from Mrs. A. D. Trounson, who
arrived in Sydney from England with
her husband, the newly-appointed U.K.
Information Officer. Mrs. Trounson said
everyone really adored Mr. Macmillan,
who came to Italy from North Africa
with a reputation for really looking after
his staff. She met her husband in Italy,
they married, and after the war, when
he was attached to the Embassy, they
lived in a villa on the ancient Appian
Way, in Rome. One of the sad memories
of their transfer to England, where they
lived in a 500-year-old Sussex farm-
house, was having to leave behind their
pets. “No more animals,” they decided ;
it was too heartbreaking to go through
again. Mrs. Trounson was in Venice
when the art-treasures that had been
hidden there during the war were re-
trieved. Before they were restored to
their original places in churches and
cathedrals they were exhibited in one
great collection. Settling into a house
at Vaucluse is happily occupying much
of Mrs. Trounson’s time just now ; her
mother, Mrs. J. Dow, is with them, and
all are enraptured by their view of the
Harbor. Later, with Mr. Trounson, they
intend to see as much of Australia as
possible. They are all very enthusiastic
about the wildflowers of W.A., which
they saw on the way here, and the beauty
of the country.

Omar Khayyam wondered what the
vintners bought one-half so precious as
the wine they sold ; a party of Aus-
tralians may find the answer to this ques-
tion next year, when they will travel
leisurely through the wine-producing dis-
tricts of the Continent and enjoy hospi-
tality at many of the famous chateau-
vineyards on an organised “vintage
tour.” A party to give those interested
the opportunity to meet some of their
fellow-travellers was held recently, hosts
being Mr. and Mrs. de Jongh, in co-
operation with host of the Bistro, Johnny
Walker. An idea worth handing-on to
intending travellers came from Mrs. Jess
Palmer, who is going on the tour and is
a seasoned traveller. She had a deep-
blue velvet coat made (good quality
material, uncrushable) and uses it on the
plane as a dressing-gown and a day-coat;
by adding a collar and lapels of lace,
which clip into place, she has an elegant
coat for after-dark glamor-occasions.
Other guests at the party were Mrs. H.
McKellar, Miss Doris Fitton and Mrs.
Athol Lyons.

MELBOURNE
Over 1000 guests “spliced the main-
brace” (but not in rum!) at the Navy
dinner-dance, which is always a feature
of the spring racing-festivities. The
function was held at the St. Kilda Palais
and the decorations were in the Navy
tradition. The official enclosure was set
in front of a sky-blue curtain starred
in silver, and before it was the White
Ensign (most appropriate, as proceeds
were in aid of the White Ensign Club).
There were also colorful pennants and
the Australian Flag topped a mast nearby.
As the Governor arrived with Lady
Brooks his personal standard was broken
from another masthead. Lifebuoys
bearing the names of visiting R.A.N.
ships hung in front of the bandstand,
and at the opposite end of the ballroom
to the official enclosure was a ship’s
bell hanging from a tripod and sur-
mounted by large golden anchors.
During dinner, music was supplied by
the band of Flinders Naval Depot, which
later gave an exhibition of figure-march-
ing. The vice-regal party was received
by the president of the ball-committee,
Mrs. J. Plunkett-Cole (wearing a lovely
diamente-scattered gown of embroidered
white organza), and her husband, Com-
modore Plunkett-Cole.
A bouffant gown of haze-blue silk-
taffeta, with the back fullness of the skirt
drawn into a bustle-bow, was chosen by
Lady Brooks. Mrs. Henry Bolte chose
a sheath-gown of delphinium-blue re-
embroidered lace, scattered wtih dia-
mente. Sir George and Lady Paton
and Mr. and Mrs. Robin Byrne were
also in the vice-regal party. Admiral
H. M. Burrell came from Canberra for
the function, as did the Minister for the
Navy, Senator John Gorton, and Mrs.
Gorton. The official party included the
Prime Minister of the Malayan Federa-
tion, Tengku Abdul Rahman, and repre-
senting the R.A.A.F. was Air-Vice-
Marshal A. L. Walters, who was
accompanied by Mrs. Walters. Mrs. Ken
Luke, whose husband is president of the
White Ensign Club, wore a gown of
French organza patterned in royal-blue
and white. Ticket-secretaries were Mrs.
G. L. Fowle (whose black Chantilly-lace
was mounted on shell-pink taffeta), and
Mrs. John Casson (wearing a jade-green
chiffon Grecian-style gown).

A windy Oaks Day made it difficult
to keep in place the large picture-hat
which is usually so prominent a feature
of the fashion-scene. With the exception
of a few extravagant outfits the dress-
ing was charming, but it was the hats
rather than the frocks which caught the
eye; among the most notable styles
were the small boaters, sailor-hats and
bowlers. Perhaps the smartest little hat
of the day was the white trilby finished
with a wide-mesh eye-veil worn by Mrs.
Ray Joseph with her simple white pure-
silk tailored frock coin-spotted in black.
Mrs. Richard Frank was a picture in
her sheath-frock of beige French-lace,
large hat made of brown tulle and featur-
ing rows and rows of pie-crust frills
around the brim, and her parasol was
of frilled silk to match her hat. Mrs.
John Mullany wore another typical Oaks
Day ensemble —a sheath-frock of
powder-blue embroidered sheer nylon,
one of the new “pumpkin” crowned
hats in the same material, and blue kid
shoes ; her parasol matched her outfit.
Black-and-white was popular, so was
navy-and-white. The deep detachable
Bertha-collar was seen on a number of
smart frocks. On black or navy, the
collar was usually of white organdie,
but several black frocks carried a deep
collar in beige. The new shades pale-
bamboo and bone were chosen by many
women, whilst beige, cocoa, donkey-
brown and cognac had many followers.
There were many white linen outfits,
and, of course, printed silks were
everywhere. Lady Brooks chose an
ensemble in her favorite blue, and
Lady George, wife of the Governor
of S.A., wore a frock and coat
of white faille printed in Wedgwood-
blue. Lady Manifold was in pale-blue
linen, and the Premier’s wife, Mrs.
Henry Bolte, wore a coat of ink-blue
faille over a frock printed in varying
shades of blue.
Slim, attractive, and with an engaging
personality, Madame Chen Chihmai,
wife of the new Ambassador for the
Republic of China, was born in Shang-
hai and educated at the Sacre Coeur
Convent there. She speaks excellent
English, with a slight trace of Ameri-
can accent, acquired during the six years
she worked in New York, Washington
and Michigan. The Ambassador and
his wife met when he was China’s dele-
gate to the United Nations and she was
private-secretary to the Republic 's per-
moment representative at U.N. He was
then a widower, with a son and daughter
who are now students, one at the Paris
Sorbonne, the other in Ohio. Madame
Chen, a smart dresser, combines Western
fashion-ideas with those of the traditional
cheongsam. John Warlow photo.
At the annual Lucky Horseshoe
dinner-dance held at Ciro’s in aid of
Red Cross a huge flower-covered horse-
shoe decorated the foyer, and flower-
covered horseshoes were on every table.
The president of the committee which
organised it, Mrs. Bruce Matear, with
her husband welcomed the 250 guests.
Her striking outfit combined a strapless
re-embroidered French-lace top and a
short, full skirt of coral-pink silk-shan-
tung. The ticket-secretaries were Mrs.
Robert Lane and Mrs. Peter Kinnear.
Mrs. Lane’s pale-apricot re-embroidered
lace frock featured a bell-skirt; Mrs.
Kinnear’s Empire-line frock was of
beige silk-shantung. Committee-member
Mrs. Douglas Bowden chose a lovely
frock of white guipure-lace embroidered
in moonlight-sequins. A full skirt of pale-
gold taffeta and a matching guipure-
lace bodice was the choice of Mrs.
Graeme Fair. The Toby Colemans, Mr.
and Mrs. David Leahy, Mr. and Mrs.
David Darling and Mr. and Mrs. Garry
Gray were others who dined and danced.

Mr. K. Y. Leung, Consul for the
Republic of China, and Mrs. Leung
entertained a number of guests at two
cocktail-parties in their Toorak home.
At the first, guests-of-honor were the
Chinese Ambassador, Dr. C. M. Chen,
and Madame Chen, the latter wearing a
Chinese sheath-frock of fawn satin
embossed with a traditional Chinese pat-
tern, contrasted with scarlet satin shoes
and scarlet handbag. Mrs. Leung’s choice
was a national-costume of blue-and-
white-patterned silk. Guests included
Mrs. Henry Bolte, Philippines Consul
“Bing” Molyneux and his wife, Mona-
gasque Consul Michael Niall and Mrs.
Niall, Mr. T. Grant Major (Canadian
Commercial Counsellor) and Mrs. Grant
Major, Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Ridley,
Sir Arthur and Lady Smithers, Mr. and
Mrs. Aubrey Gibson and Mr. and Mrs.
John Dynon.
The second party was in honor of
Dr. Ku Cheng-Kang, who is from For-
mosa and is chairman of the Asian
Peoples Anti-Communist League. As his
plane was delayed, the party stretched-
on from the cocktail-hour until much
later, when a buffet-dinner was served.
Among the 120 guests were Chief Secre-
tary Arthur Rylah, Housing Minister
H. R. Petty, Senator and Mrs. George
Hannan, Sir Albert and Lady Coates,
Mr. and Mrs. W. K. Burnside, Sii
Clifden and Lady Eager, University
Chancellor Mr. Justice Dean and Mrs.
Dean, Sir Charles Lowe, and Professor
and Mrs. Maurice Belz.


to Scorfield, from Phil May to Low,
Australia has in fact always drawn
pretty heavily on overseas talent.
Perhaps we may claim some
national virtue in having made a place
for these importations amongst our
own vigorous practitioners, as English
literature has made a place for Yeats,
an Irishman, Eliot, an American, and
Conrad, a Pole. But at any rate as far
as Molnar and Mercier are concerned,
the simple and familiar reason for their
success seems to be that the spectator
sees more of the game than the players.
In Mercier’s case it seems that look-
ing at Australia from the vantage-
point of a New Caledonian origin has
given him a relish for the peculiarities
of our language—many of his cartoons
are simply based on word-play—and,
more importantly, a relish, as of one
tasting a new, strong cheese —for the
common stuff of distinctively Aus-
tralian life. He looks upon our crudi-
ties with that disarming blend of
amusement and appreciation which
made a success of Nino Culotta’s
“They’re a Weird Mob” ... and it is
a pity that, to prove the point about
foreigners, Culotta wasn’t a genuine
Italian. He was, though, except in his
excursions into flattery, a very good
imitation of one.
Molnar, perhaps with no great taste
for the lower elements of the weird
mob, has remained more European in
his outlook: and is, in consequence, a
shining example of the profit, both in
social commentary and art, we are
likely to derive from immigration. His
black-and-white line, spidery and
elegant, is essentially European—it has
been familiar, especially in French
magazines, for generations. His love
for the baroque in decoration and
architecture is European; and his types
—especially the rat-like, faintly repel-
lent individual who serves him some-
times for civil-servant, sometimes for
scientist and sometimes for Sydney
householder—are also (one hopes)
European.
It is interesting, when the necessities
of cartooning force him away from
these European generalisations to see
more recognisable Australian types
emerging, as in his stalwart and fat-
headed wharfies and his women bulg-
ing in slacks or squirming in fashion-
able dresses. And, whether or not the
types are Australian, it is fascinating
at all times to see his ironic, urbane,
European wit applied to the Australian
scene. It is exactly the kind of wit, at
once profoundly cynical and gentle,
that you get in the plays of Capek or
Biro, and is as much literary as artistic
—in fact his ideas and his “gags” are
often really more amusing than his
drawings.
One paradoxical result of his sophis-
ticated and cosmopolitan viewpoint is
that he is able to criticise the con-
temporary world as much as he likes
(glass houses; the sack-look; abstract
art; even the sacrosanct Opera House)
and yet remain himself thoroughly con-
temporary—he knows what the high
fashions are, even if they don’t
measure-up to his standards of old
European elegance. Another, more
obvious, advantage is that he is
unusually well-fitted to comment on
foreign affairs —he sees Khrushchev as
Europe sees him.
This book, he says, comprises about
a tenth of the thousand cartoons he
has drawn for the S. M. “Herald” since
he joined its staff. It is a pity, seeing
that cosmopolitan themes suit him so
well and his travels forced him into
direct observation, that he has not
included the delightful “postcards” he
sent back to the “Herald” from his
trips abroad. But maybe these will
yet have their day; and the present
“Insubstantial Pageant” certainly
makes a substantial contribution to the
gaiety of the nation.
Catullus et Al.
In his little book on Catullus, The
Catullan Revolution (Melbourne Uni-
versity Press), Kenneth Quinn, senior
lecturer in classics at Melbourne Uni-
versity, considers Catullus as the first
of the poetae novi, the new poets, who
addressed, not the whole community,
but a small group of friends. Quinn
considers this “The Beginnings of
Modern Lyric”:—
The first consequence of this is a
measure of unintelligibility to the
outsider, because the poet does not
bother to inform him fully about
what is going on. This disturbs no
reader familiar with contemporary
poetry, but it has in the past puzzled
and exasperated scholars grown
accustomed to the public character
that ancient literature possesses....
When poetry is written on the re-
duced scale that the New Poetry
exploited, the gains are particularly
important. Here, provided the poet
gave the uninitiated reader —or
hearer—outside the poet’s small
original circle just enough to go
0n.... then the economy and the
intensity of the new technique are
inestimable.
The bit about economy and intensity
applies to John Berryman’s Homage
to Mistress Bradstreet (Faber), some
450 lines which Edmund Wilson con-
siders the most distinguished long
poem by an American since “The
Waste Land.” It is about an English-
woman who went to America in 1630
and died before her husband became
governor: her journey, landing, build-
ing, childbearing, nostalgia for Eng-
land, privations, unsatisfied desires,
anxiety for her children.
The trials of this pioneer soul the
poet has expressed in the metre of
Hopkins’s lament for the nuns lost in
“The Wreck of the Deutschland,” but
his use of the words is also characteris-
tic of Dylan Thomas: —
Drydust in God’s eye the acquavivid
skin
of Simon snoring lit with fountain*
ing dawn
when my eyes unlid, sad.
John Cotton shines on Boston’s sin—-
I am drawn, in pieties that seem
the weary drizzle of an unremem-
bered dream.
Women have gone mad
at twenty-one. Ambition mines,
atrocious, in.
For anyone who knows the personal
and historical background of all this
it has no doubt what Quinn calls a
“gain” of “economy and intensity”;
but even suppose you knew who John
Cotton was, and puzzled-out the first
line, there would still be a feeling of
something lacking in comparison with
its great metrical model:—
Dame, at our door
Drowned, and among our shoals,
Remember us in the roads, the
heaven-haven of the Reward:
Our King back, oh, upon English
souls!
Let him easter in us, be a dayspring
to the dimness of us, be a
crimson-crested east,
More brightening her, rare-dear
Britain, as his reign rolls
Pride, rose, prince, hero of us, high-
priest,
Our heart’s charity’s hearth’s fire,
our thoughts’ chivalry’s throng's
Lord.
Hopkins’s superiority was in his
music; his short pieces or long pieces
are all highly organised, and mostly
reminiscent of organ music, either at its
quietest or in great barking rolls of
sound: “Our heart’s charity’s hearth’s
fire ...” He was a student of the
alliterative devices at the heart of the
old poetry; in his Presenting Welsh
Poetry (Faber) Gwyn Williams says:—
9
Dylan Thomas must, technically,
have owed more to Hopkins than to
the whole body of Welsh poetry, in
which he showed little interest....
G. M. Hopkins remains the most
rewarding hunting-ground for Welsh
poetic devices in English.
But the rhyming-games detailed by
Williams (cross consonance, connected
cross consonance, trailing consonance
and chiming consonance) aside, the
preservative of Hopkins, as of that
other notorious twister of words, John
Donne, will be his music; and for some
of us it is the music which is the
poetry: we like to see a poet working
his metre, making the metre share the

OLD WELLINGTON DAYS
This is not by any means a parochial history. The happenings he enlarges on in a unique
manner from a boyhood diary of nearly 60 years ago is a pattern of life important still;
it deals with Katherine Mansfield’s Wellington (her birthplace), giving in story and picture
new and important aspects of her life and of those who knew her.
Beautifully printed and illustrated, it sells in two editions: the special signed and numbered
edition of 200 copies at 56/-, and the ordinary edition at 30/-.

work of the words in conveying feeling
and even in making its own comment
on the poetry —we like, in any case, to
feel that the form of the poem makes
some kind of musical unity.
Such ideas, says Quinn, existed for
Catullus and his friends, and he has
something to say of their interest in
versification. But today it would be
foolish not to see a vogue for a poetry
which almost completely excludes
music ; in which the poetic idea exists
as a complex (and one can well believe
beautiful) equation exists for the
mathematician, or as a painting exists
for an artist. If Berryman teiyds to
work with ideogram-equations, Robert
Lowell, another American, exemplifies,
in Life Studies (Faber) the poetry of
picture-ideograms:—
My father had had two coronaries.
He still cherished underhand eco-
nomies,
but his best friend was his little black
Chevie,
garaged like a sacrificial steer
with gilded hooves,
yet sensationally sober,
and with less side than an old
dancing-pump
and: —•
When I embarked from Italy with
my Mother’s body,
the whole shoreline of the Golfo di
Genova
was breaking into fiery flower.
The crazy yellow and azure sea-sleds
blasting like jack-hammers across
the spumante-bubbbng, wake of our
liner
recalled the clashing colors of my
Ford.
Mother travelled first-class in the
hold,
her Risorgimento black and gold
casket
was like Napoleon’s at the In-
valides....
Now, whereas Berryman’s involved
style might qualify, as Quinn says of
Catullus, as “hard poetry —not for the
general public, but for the lettered
elite, who have the culture needed to
appreciate its subtleties and the
enthusiasm for tracking them down”—
Robert Lowell’s is hard poetry and
Catullan in the sense that Catullus,
however subtle he might have been
(and here the reviewer can rely only
on the translations given by Quinn and
the study of his children’s school cribs)
was clear and direct. The Roman
hardness of Catullus is unmistakable:
They’re no celibate nights you’re
passing. Your room,
though tongueless, shrieks its testi-
mony just the same.
All those flowers, that oily Syrian
scent,
those pillows crumpled just as much
on either side,
that rickety bed, so knocked about
it emits
falsetto creaks as it wanders round
the r00m....
It is like thought cut on stone.
Compare with it a room by Lowell: —
We couldn’t even keep the furnace
lit!
Even when we had disconnected it
the antiquated
refrigerator gurgled mustard gas
through your mustard-yellow house,
and spoiled our long-manoeuvred
visit
from T. S. Eliot’s brother, Henry
Ware....
The styles of the American poem
and the unmetrical English transla-
tion of Catullus are so alike that one
might think modem American poets
learned their prosody from line-by-line
translations . . .
The “Catullan Revolution,” Quinn
says, although it led to Horace, failed
in the degree to which Propertius and
Tibullus tried to copy Catullus’s sad
affair with Lesbia:—
The relative failure of Augustan
elegists lies in the fact that they
became obsessed with trying to make
poetry out of an identical experience.
Although he makes a great number
of comparisons of the New Poetry of
Catullus with the new poetry of our
times, Quinn does not press the obvious
question, whether a great many con-
temporary poets fail by trying to make
poetry out of the same experience as'
that of T. S. Eliot. But with poets like
Berryman and Lowell, one would say
that their subject-matter, and even
their attitude to it, are comparatively
fresh and original: the experience they
fail to transmit is the experience of
music.

Ralph Izzard, foreign-correspondent

The Pledge: Friedrich Duerrenmatt
(Cape). This is an exquisitely fashioned
novel —really a long short-story—clear,
powerful and austere in style, which
has been faithfully translated from the
original German. This young Swiss
writer is a sophisticate who doesn’t
parade his sophistication. He tells the
story of an inspector of the Swiss
cantonal police who, when a child has
been murdered by a sex-maniac, is not
satisfied with the official solution to
the crime, and he throws away a career
of great promise to set-out on his own
to find the killer.

Short and practical, Shooting and
Shooting Bushcraft, by S. H. (“Barney”)
Edwards (Angus and Robertson) is just
the book I’ve been looking for to give
my sons before taking them out in the
field. The first chapter is on safety—
that’s excellent. I’ve known a couple of
men shot by “unloaded” guns and two
or three who’ve killed themselves
through faulty handling of arms—and
once I was peppered by an enthusiastic
amateur who forgot there were other
men on his flank. There’s a chapter
about guns and another on rifles—con-
cise and telling the beginner just what he
needs to know. Handling of arms,
shooting at moving targets, stalking,
night-shooting, whistles and decoys:
these chapters are all sound sense. I
like best those about the size of shot
to use, shooting to kill and bushcraft:
the essence of the sport. There’s a good
section, too, on skinning and pegging
skins. The whole book is well illus-
trated, with one fault on page 77,
where the diagram-caption is obviously
misplaced.—
