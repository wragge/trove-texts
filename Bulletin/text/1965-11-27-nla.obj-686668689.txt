Catcher in the Rye
From the fields of rye of the Murray Mallee to the acreages of sorghum of
the Darling Downs, the catcher comes. Across the massive wheat-belt,
loose-hung like a golden girdle across the face of mainland Australia, the
catcher comes when summer has fulfilled its promise. When barley and
oats and maize and rice yield up their harvests from twice ten thousand
holdings, unfailingly the catcher comes.
The vital story of the collection and distribution of the nation’s cereal
harvest is one in which the Railways of Australia play a dominant part.
Into the main rail arteries the cereal flows year-long. From a nationwide
network of branch line capillaries that sustain home markets, enrich
Australia through export earnings, unceasingly the cereal flows.
The spectacular story of Australia’s bountiful grain harvests has been
and remains - the story of her railways.

H. J Heinz Co. Australia Ltd recognise the difference in fencing
brand sorority fencing lasts longer
because it’s better made and belter erected
Heinz preferred Cyclone’s 67 years of experience
when it came to choosing a security fence to guard
their valuable plant and assets.
Although the security fences Heinz compared
looked alike, they chose Cyclone brand because
they could be sure it was better made and better
erected. These are the reasons why big industry
throughout Australia prefers to specify Cyclone
security fencing above all others. They know they
get top quality materials, a first class erection job,
and will always be able to rely on service.

PROTEUS-
the aero-engine that
started a revolution
Chosen for the world’s largest hovercraft
Powerplant for the fastest fighting ships of seven navies
4 million flying hours in Britannia aircraft
Generates electrical power for industry
THE Bristol Siddeley Proteus, chosen as the
powerplant for the new, large-capacity
hovercraft, began its working
life conventionally enough in
a Britannia airliner.
Millions of flying hours later, it broke with
convention by powering a fast naval vessel.
This was a major breakthrough in marine
propulsion: an aero-engine afloat, with four
times more power per lb
weight than any marine
engine.
Next, Proteus was installed in a village
in south-west England, supplying the inhab-
itants with 2,700 kW of electricity at peak
periods.
This opened up a new prospect of electrical
generation for power authorities and industry,
including high-output, mobile
power stations.
Other interesting applications
may well await this most versatile of engines.
Meantime, it can already justifiably claim to
have caused a revolution in power.

jrV f a n of the British Empire must
Ive dashed off a quick chapter over the
bst few' days when Kenneth Tynan’s
E letter word on the BBC pushed
esia off the front pages of the
on papers.
<ln the main, Britain seemed equal to
lie crisis. The Tynan one, that is.
owever, Paul Johnson in the “New
atesman” may have expressed every
iglishman’s secret dread when he dis-
ced his owm:
“My own fear is that these convenient
tie words will soon become devalued by
Lblic use. If they become part of every-
iy chat, what do we say when strong
Inguage is really called for? It’s not
a though we have in reserve a set of
len more dreadful words; there just
fcn’t any.”

Eied world peace but their livelihood,

&t returned home to retirement after
j 6 years with UN.

poster that Pact, the Sydney actors’ co-
operative, now ekes out its folk-song pro-

Nebenzahl is switching in spite of the
fact that Newport, one of Sydney’s north-
ern beaches, is a favorite haunt of the
school-leavers and jazz’s following is
very much among the late twenties and
early thirties age-groups. Jazz, Neben-
zahl believes, is coming back strongly,
although in one sense it never goes out.
Now there are new bands, big bands and
new places for them to play in.
Good News
'Tkyf’ACMiLLAN’s “Summer’s Tales No. 2”
A is now in the bookshops, in time for
the Christmas trade. “Summer's Tales”
seems to be the most cheerful thing which
has happened for some time to short-story
writers, notably one of the depressed
sections of Australian writing. Payment
is on a royalty basis and for the first
book was around £3O per story. This
compares with the two-guineas token
payment which Angus and Robertson’s
have made for contributions to their
biennial “Coast to Coast”.
Print figure and British order for the
second volume is larger than for the first
and five New Zealand authors are in-
cluded. This time, too, in accord with
a confessed preference of the editor,
Kylie Tennant, the collection is some-
what more bushwackery than the first,
and may at least prove that good bush
stories are still being written.
Impact
Tt looks is if the question of an anti-
smoking campaign will be tossed
eternally between Commonwealth and
States. The Federal Minister for Health,
Mr Swartz, last week told a delegation
that it was “a matter for the State#',
while the NSW Health Minister, Mr
Jago, believes that “the best changes
come slowly”.
However, cigarette companies are not-
ably resourceful. The English tobacco
company, Gallaher’s, has used heavy ad-
vertising to launch its cigarettes on the
Australian market, but it may make its
heaviest impact with the three £lO,OOO
Aquavit 8P hydrofoil launches which are
on Samaritan runs around the waterways
of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.
The launches, with Gallaher painted
on the sides, co-operate with water police.
In three operational weeks on Sydney
Harbor they have rescued people from
capsized yachts and performed other
friendly tasks. The firm hopes the hydro-
foil will help out with the start of the
Sydney-Hobart yacht race.
If cigarette advertising is to be believ-
ed, this is a shrewd move as most of the
addicts seem to lead a healthy, outdoor
life.
Pennies From Heaven
currency is already causing a
gentle upslide in prices. Take the
sweets department. The 2d. packets of
PK were replaced by 6d. packets. This
made for an easy changeover to five
cents, but there is a catch. The 2d.
packets contained four pieces; the big
packets have only 10.
Then as an obvious decimal adjust-
ment Quick-Eze have gone up from
7d. to Bd. or seven cents. Life Savers
have gone up from 4d. to sd. or four
cents. When you have to pay more for
your Life Savers that’s a real increase in
the cost of living.
"That serves the dirty beast right - now she's eating him!"


THIS AUSTRALIA
MALAYSIA
The Admirable Critchley
It was, certainly, the end of an era. But it was also a measure of it when the
Prime Minister of an independent Asian country referred sincerely, if jokingly, to a
departing Australian High Commissioner as being “just as much a ‘bumiputra’ (Malay
for ‘son of the soil’) as any of us”.
The Prime Minister was Tunku Abdul
Rahman, the departing diplomat was 49-
year-old Tom Critchley, and the compli-
ment was paid during what became a
farewell golfing weekend in the luxurious
surroundings of the newly opened Mini-
sterial rest-house in the Cameron High-
lands.
The Malaysian Prime Minister did
more than pay compliments —he be-
stowed the title of Dato, the Malaysian
equivalent of a knighthood, on the de-
parting bumiputra.
Last week Tom Critchley gave his
farewell Press conference in Kuala
Lumpur. Harvey Stockwin, who was
there, reports:
ITlhe warm words spoken on this, and
many other occasions during the last
few days, are indicative of the warm and
high regard which many Malaysians feel
for Critchley, who, as a result of his
ten-year spell, has become something of
an institution. (“When he’s in a room
you don’t notice him; when he’s not
there, you miss him” was one MP’s
testimony.) Similarly, this high esteem
and Critchley’s many close contacts with
Malaysia and Asia symbolise the
growing intimacy of Australia’s commit-
ment to her environment.
For all that, the many, complex in-
tricacies (real or jealously imagined)
associated with Critchley’s departure re-
main, perhaps, too far removed from the
Asian reality seen in Essendon or Rose
Bay, Canberra or Kalgoorlie. At his fare-
well Press conference “Critcho” recalled
the main events of his, in all, twelve-year
direct association with Malaysia and
Singapore.
Critchley remains that still-too-rare
Australian commodity—a man who not
only appreciates Asian reality but also
has a developed appreciation of Asian
need.
Has this scarce resource been used to
best effect? It is hard to avoid the con-
clusion that his prolonged posting here
was a mistake. Paradoxically, with a
lesser man it might not have mattered.
Given Critchley’s admirable capacity of
making friends in high Asian places (as
every diplomat should but few, especially
Western ones can), it inevitably resulted
in his becoming closely attached in the
public mind to the Malaysian Establish-
ment. In a more politically volatile
country this might have been disastrous
and would have required his instant
if unjustified replacement on power
changing hands. As it was, as the PAP-
Alliance cold war made Malay sian
politics more tumultuous, it had some
effect.
For example, Lee Kuan Yew, during
his much publicised CIA “anti-Ameri-
can” interview found it necessary to hint,
when speaking of a memorandum he
supplied on Menzies’ request: “Look, 1
have lived here all my life. I know Mr
Tom Critchley; he has been here for a
long time . . . but I have been here my
life-time ... I will be 42. I am not as
old as Mr Critchley: he is a wiser man.”
Without going into all the ramifica-
tions of this aside, it can be said that
Lee, shrewd power politician that he is,
hoped, perhaps, that Australian influence
would assist his objectives. Until the
archives open it is a fairly safe bet that
Critchley, while fully appreciating these
aims, was understandably also apprecia-
tive of the complexity of Malay thought
and feeling. The decision to prolong his
stay here, due in part to the continu-
ing arrival of crisis upon crisis, brought
about a situation of advantage to no
one.
This point can best be seen in re ji
tion to the most important
reaction to Critchley’s departure, fpy
have been many, the most sustained 01
of regret being mentioned alreat
Malaysians having got so accustom
to his presence, his sudden departure i
sudden for the Asian way of looki
at things sparked off conjectures a:
rumors. A widely heard one was thi
he was being moved because Austral
was kept in the dark over separata®
that London was a demotion. That!
departure was planned pre-August 9 wfc
not known, and the complexities L
Australian representation were dim']
appreciated.) |
This important reaction comes fr#
the younger generation of national#*
both inside and outside politics. They |r
mainly UMNO-oriented and for thefe
while they may disagree with it, sepa|i
tion was at least an assertion of Malagj
sian independence; they see in tf
almost simultaneous departure of P
British and Australian High Comm|
sioners what they hope will be the
of an era in which, for their taste, £
Western connection and Wester
influence have been far too strong.
there is a connection between the ass| e
tion and the departures, they are i c
sorry. Their feelings are important
understand. In less complex counirif
than Malaysia they might already holt
the reins of power. They are more pr®
Malaysian than merely anti-Westei|
Some of them are quite willing to adii
that the close identification with tf
ruling elite of Critchley and Lord Headjr
predecessor as British High Commif
sioner, Sir Geoffrey Tory, was also tr
fault of Malaysians themselves. 1
On the one hand they are not all tla
keen on their leaders' capacity to seimi
and sustain Western friendships ratl)|si
than Afro-Asian ones. On the other thtfa

Ghosts of Empire
By ALAN RE[?]D
It has been a long time since Sir Robert Menzies sat through a full debate in
the House of Representatives. But he sat through nearly the entire debate on Rhodesia’s
unilateral Declaration of Independence. It was a measure of the importance he gave it.
For him, it must have been a clearcut
watershed between the British Empire of
his boyhood and mature manhood, and
the disintegrating organisation which is
the present Commonwealth, already
fragmented by the rise of former colonial
territories to the status of nationhood.
Here he was condemning as illegal,
and authorising economic sanctions
against an administration representing
settlers of European extraction whose
title as Rhodesian citizens was, as
Opposition Leader Mr Calwell said, “As
good as our title to Australian citizens,
which is nothing more noi less than that
we were born here or have chosen to
live here”.
For Sir Robert it must have been a sad
moment and he made no attempt to
disguise his sadness. Here he
was condemning men whom
he had been taught in his
younger days to applaud as
courageous pioneers. As the
apostle of gradualism he de-
clared that what was needed n
Rhodesia was “a reasonable
timetable, accompanied by a
special education campaign to
which all ol us might well
contribute something to fit the
majority African voters for
their ultimate authority”.
Menzies was prepared to go
a long way to exorcise the attractive
ghosts of his youth when European and
British dominance of native peoples in
Africa was unchallenged. He was pre-
pared to face up to the legal position.
He was prepared to face up to the
fact that Britain had a responsibility to
re-establish its authority through means
such as economic sanctions which Aus-
tralia was prepared tc support He was
prepared to support the proposition that
ultimately the African voters should be
placed in a position that they formed the
majority of voters as well as the majority
of population. But he was not prepared
to accept that force should be used to
re-establish British authority. Force, he
maintained, would produce more ruin
and disaster than any Australian was
prepared to contemplate.
He left it to Calwell to contemplate
the use of armed force. Calwell made
his basic theme, that as a political act,
UDI “must be defeated” Said Calwell:
“The British Government has declared
that it believes the use of force will be
unnecessary. It has not said that under
no circumstances will force be used.
IAN SMITH
Some circumstances may arise in which
some sort of military force may have
to be used in Rhodesia. Supposing the
best efforts of Mr Wilson fail and the
choice then were between an African
war and a United Nations peace-keeping
force. Why have wc bound ourselves in
advance? And more immediately im-
portant, why has the Australian Govern-
ment chosen to inhibit the British Gov-
ernment in this way at this time?”
Government members claimed that
Mr Calwell was adopting “a belligerent
and bellicose attitude” which was out
of tune with recent Labor attitudes on
issues where a basic principle was just
as much at stake. Asked Liberal Sir
Wilfrid Kent Hughes: “Is there one law
for the Medes and another for the
Persians? The United Nations
is defied by the President of
Indonesia and Dr Subandrio
on the terms on which West
Irian was handed over to them,
but the United Nations does
not suggest-economic sanctions
or force against Indonesia.”
Labor’s Mr Kim Beazley
whose speech was described
by the Minister for External
Affairs, Mr Paul Hasluck, as
“informed and thoughtful”
also dealt with the possibility
of the use of force but in
a different way. Said Beazley: “Espous-
ing Rhodesia’s racial superiority policy
and abandoning Rhodesia to domina-
tion by a European minority in
perpetuity would place in jeopardy
European communities all through
Africa, especially in Kenya. Nothing
that puts pressure on Mr Wilson to use
force, or that seeks to produce a crisis
ir Rhodesia is of any ultimate value.
At the same time, if the forces pressing
in the United Nations for the application
of force become strong, then Common-
wealth forces —-the forces of the Crown
unlikely to be resisted by Rhodesian
Europeans—may well be better forces
to use than the forces of strangers.”
It was a brief debate. There were ten
speakers Menzies himself, Calwell,
Kent Hughes, the Deputy Opposition
Eeader Mr Whitlam. the Territories
Minister Mr Barnes, Mr Beazley, Mr
Hasluck, Labor’s Dr Cairns, and Mr
Clyde Cameron and Liberal, Mr Killen.
It was in a way a sad debate, marking the
end of an era the hitherto unbroken
constitutional dissolution of the old Brit-
ish Empire.


CRIME
Charging the Police
Corruption, brutality, racketeering, false arrest, perjury, obtaining evidence by
violence, neglect of duty and more: it is not a pretty list. Yet these charges are all the
subject of present investigations into the police in Victoria and New South Wales.
Of the two States it is Victoria where
the situation is the more disturbing, cer-
tainly the more bizarre. Almost every day
brings a new lot of serious allegations,
a new wave of doubts, a new political
clash. The police force which, a bare
two years ago under the late Commis-
sioner Porter, had reached the highest
point of public confidence seems like a
memory.
“It was always easy to deny any
serious allegations against the Victorian
police—until a couple of weeks ago. Un-
fortunately some of them may now be
found to be true.” Off-the-cuff at a pri-
vate party the remark came from Police
Inspector William Crowley.
As Secretary of the Police Associa-
tion, Inspector Crowley’s role is to
defend the policeman. But even he, in
what seems a harmless remark,
emphasised the gravity of a full-scale
investigation into Victoria’s police force.
Inspector Crowley admitted when the
allegations first became public: “You’ll
always find a bad egg,” but hastened
to add the the Victorian police force
had a particularly good record.
Just now, the police are being attacked
from all directions by judges as well
as underworld informers. Mr Justice
Sholl has said in the Criminal Court
that he has lost confidence in police
methods of interrogation. Judge Rapke
acquitted a youth on a shop-breaking
charge because he felt the youth was
“a marionette performing a part he had
been told to perform” when he allegedly
confessed to detectives. The Solicitor-
General has found evidence of the use
of violence, or threats of violence, in
the questioning of suspects.
An investigation into a series of
allegations against the police had been
under way for several years but in
secret. Now, since the investigation has
become a public talking-point, it has
been stepped up. At the same time, it
is a cause of considerable embarrassment
to the police force as well as to the
State Government. The Government is
duty-bound to keep the public informed
and it is anxious to rid the force of
the “bad eggs”. But in doing so it runs
the risk of establishing widespread mis-
trust in the State’s 4,500 policemen.
It was just one man, an underworld
police informer, who caused the present
upheaval. His allegations, made to the
Solicitor-General in minute detail, varied
little from those made by other police
informers but he was the only one
who told the Press as well. He claimed
he had kept certain police officers
informed of the activities of other

is that several police officers have alreai

Superintendent James Milner. 52, saidjtj

understatement of last week: “It’s a vei

Tn NSW, too, the police are getting
“bad Press”—if a less seriously oi
raged one than in Victoria.
The urbane NSW Police Coninti|
sioner Mr Norman Allan (Norman If
Foreman, as the police jocularly refert|
him) has had a sore throat for the pi
week. Not unnaturally perhaps, becai)
the allegations against senior police®
at Central Police Station would stick i
the throat of any Commissioner tryinj
hard to improve the image of his poM
force. f
On Thursday, November 11, a rug®
“knockabout” named William Leonat
Stinavics, 34, claimed from a bed#
Sydney Hospital that police had basif

policemen that up to six had been need-
ed to arrest him. He was arrested at
10.15 p.m. on the Monday on charges
of using indecent language, resisting ar-
rest, and assaulting police.
To an audience of reporters and photo-
graphers he claimed that four policemen,
two of them in plainclothes had “slam-
me d” into him. He said he pleaded with
the station officer for medical attention
for three hours, and that when he finally
Was lifted on to the operating table for
surgical intervention on his ruptured kid-
ne v, it was nine hours after he was
allegedly bashed.
. Mr Allan reacted swiftly to the mas-
SiVe publicity which Stinavics’ charges
received. He ordered an immediate in-
quiry by a superintendent and an inspec-
°r. The Premier, Mr Askin, a few days
aer announced that free legal assistance
would be given to Stinavics for his de-
fence of the three charges, and also for
legal action against his alleged police
assailants.
But then with the newspapers still
headlining Stinavics’ case, a vaguely
familiar pattern began to take shape, a
pattern which has appeared in previous
cases where police were inquiring into
the actions of their colleagues. Although
Mr Allan did not announce it, Det.-In-
spector Ray Kelly, feared and respected
by Sydney’s underworld joined the senior
police investigating Stinavics’ allegations.
Late last week, Stinavics began to have
doubts about the strength of his allega-
tions. He said he still “didn't know
what to do”, and added; “I think that
in my position, which I have never
denied, a man of my record cannot help
but fight a losing battle. I cannot prose-
cute. How can I point the finger at some-
one I couldn’t recognise?” Finally, at the
week-end, he rejected the offer of legal
assistance and said that as far as he was
concerned the matter was closed.
Mr Allan was still wating for the report
on Stinavics’ case when he had to an-
nounce that a major inquiry was taking
place into bribery allegations against
three sergeants - at Central Police Sta-
tion. CIB senior detectives were investig-
ating allegations that the sergeants releas-
ed arrested persons from Central cells on
forged or false bail bonds. Thousands of
pounds are believed to be involved.
Although not made public, the in-
quiries had been under way for many
months, and severe departmental action
against three sergeants at Central Station
will almost certainly emerge from the
investigation.

TOP PRIZE
WINNER FOR
TWELVE YEARS
Since its introduction in 1953, Orlando
Barossa Riesling has won more awards
than any other Australian Riesling.
One hundred and thirty-two major
awards, in fact, including Gold and
Silver Medals, Championships and Cups
throughout Australia and in Europe.
Last year, its greatest honour was the
Gold Medal awarded at the International
Viticultural and Wine Fair at Mont-
pellier, France, world-famous centre
for wine study and research.
Every bottle of Barossa Riesling awarded
a prize has been taken at random from
stock proof positive of the wine’s
unfailing consistency.
Two major reasons why you can rely
on Barossa Riesling are:
* It is bottled in the traditional European
amber Riesling bottle, in preference to
a green bottle, because Riesling needs
bottle age, and amber glass keeps
out the light while the wine is aging.
* It is one of the very few Australian
Rieslings vintaged 100% from Rhine
Riesling grapes.

is unlikely, however, to let this happen

earnings. He will doubtless be keeping
his eyes open on the balance of payments
front in the hope that the improvement
will continue and allow him more room-
to manoeuvre to counter any further
weakening in the two industrial sectors,,
motor-vehicles and housing. The Mini-'
ster for Labor, Mr W. McMahon, said
last week the Government was keeping
both industries under close scrutiny.
Despite the slump in new motor
registrations in the last two months, andj
the repercussions on the automotive in-
dustry, where more unemployment is
predicted as well as the erosion of over-
time, the industry itself seems pretty
confident. It expects new registrations
of vehicles will buck up next year to
something like an average monthly rate
of 35,000 compared to only 29,000 las
month, the lowest total since January!


Xhis still leaves room for scepticism
about the prospect for an early revival
in registrations because of the effect of
drought and low sugar prices on incomes
in Queensland where the recent fall in
sales has been most marked.
> There is a cloud, too, over housing.
But as in the cas' of motor-vehicles,
which might require a reduction in sales
tax to get them moving faster, the
authorities obviously have a lever in
making more finance available at cheaper
rates to get a lift in activity. Going on
the high rate of immigration and the
bigger number coming into marriageable
age groups there is no lack of potential
demand for housing. The same probably
goes for the ailing appliances and build-
ing equipment industries.
J. C. HORSFALL
CHURCHES
Un-Anglican Activities
Those who would seek to be respectable a«ti-Coinmunis!s should choose their
bedfellows wisely. The folly of choosing someone like Mr Butler, the National
Director of the League of Rights, lies in the propaganda bonanza it provides for
the Communists.
Mr Butler v greatest asset has alwmys
been the fact that his racist activities
remain unknown to many people who
fall into the trap of regarding the offici-
ally accredited Australian correspondent
| for the John Birch Society merely as a
dedicated, Christian anti-Communist.
But after what has happened in Mel-
bourne during the last month Mr Butler
may find that his anti-Communist credit
i rating has slipped.
At last month’s Anglican Synod, the
Reverend David J. Pope, one of the
[youngest vicars present, moved a series
of resolutions condemning Soviet anti-
Semitism and appealing for a concentra-
ted effort to break down anti-Semitic
prejudice in the general community.
[These resolutiohs were carried unani-
'mously and strongly supported by the
(Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne,
IDr Woods. In the course of his widely
publicised address to the Synod Mr Pope
said that Mr Butler, an Anglican, was
actively fomenting race hatred and anti-
Semitism under the cloak of anti-
. Communism and Christianity.
In a high-pitched effort to salvage their
1 tarnished image within the Church, the
League of Rights circulated an open
letter to members of the Synod. In it
they charged Mr Pope as being “dan-
gerously gullib’e and the dupe of smarter
people”. They also described the booklet
dealing with Mr Butler by Ken Go:t as
a “Communist recommended manual”
and “a foul hatchet piece of journalism”.
The letter also contained the ex.raordin-
ary statement that Jews “recognise that
the League stands for the only type of
society in which they can survive as a
minority group without victimisation”.
Mr Pope responded by also circulating
the 840 members of the Synod with a
letter reproducing statements from lead-
ing Australian anti-Communisls who had
condemned the League as the most active
anti-Semitic agitators in the country. Mr
Pope included a copy of the Gott book-
let with his letter and emphasised that
he had “personally checked all the refer-
ences relating to Mr Butler's anti-Semitic
and racist statements and activities”, and
W'as “prepared to vouch for their authen-
ticity and correctness . . . they made sad
reading".
Mr Pope concluded his letter, warning
that “the Australian League of Rights It
creating racial and religious enmity in
this country. That Mr Butler and his
followers do so by masquerading, in a
cliche-ridden f ashion, under the guise of
Christianity, is to me, an offence to the
teaching of Jesus about human relations.
I maintain that, as Christians, we should
deny those who desire to incite racial
hatred from utilising the Church or its
institutions as a vehicle for such goals.
We should not share platforms with
them, nor associate with them. I agree
with Dr Knopfelmacher, the leading
Melbourne academic and anti-Commu-
nist, who has frequently stated that ‘anti-
communism, linked with racism or
fascism, is morally spurious’.”
The intiative of Mr Pope might mean
that there will not be an early repetition
of a recent Melbourne meeting attended
by nearly 100 metropolitan RSL Branch
Presidents and Secretaries; guests of
honor were Mr Butler and Queenslander
Sir Raphael Cilento, a dedicated sup-
porter of the League. The result: for
two weeks the Communist “Guardian”
editorially highlighted Mr Butler's RSL
visit as alleged evidence that the RSL
was anti-Semitic, racist and reactionary.

and water ski-ing. There are also bills:
to establish a Cocoa Board, to update
town-planning laws, to license sellers of
new motor vehicles and to permit public
lotteries, all of which offer a commentary
on the present stage of the Territory’s
development.
But the most important item on the
Notice Paper is entitled “Parliamentary
Executive (Interim Provisions) Bill”. If
the bill becomes law it would be a sig-
nificant advance towards self-govern-
ment. Yet it might not become law,
thereby offering another sort of com-
mentary on the slowly developing politi-
cal struggle which lies ahead in the
Territory.
Presented at the last Session by Mr
Barry Holloway, a former Australian
patrol officer, the Bill was tabled and
immediately adjourned to the present
sittings. The Bill aims to establish a
Ministerial form of Government in which
the Members of the Administrator’s
Council (Members of the House ap-
pointed by the Minister for Territories
to assist and advise the Administrator)
are designated Ministers and vested with
Executive authority subject to the auth-
ority of the Commonwealth Government.
The reason for the adjournment was
that Mr John Guise, the Leader of the
elected Members, believed that the pro-
posals cut across the work of the Com-
mittee on Constitutional and Political
Development, of which he is Chairman.
Mr Guise said that the Committee would
be embarrassed if the Bill was passed.
Mr Holloway disagrees, but it remains
to be seen whether he has gained enough
support to force the Bill through.
Mr Guise’s embarrassment at the pro-
posed legislation is not nearly as acute as
the concern some members have at the
activities of his Constitutional Commit-
tee. His pre-occupation with matters
such as a national anthem, a flag and
a name for the country assumes that
Papua and New Guinea will be one
nation and that the Papuans will sur-
render their Australian citizenship. This
is a very vexed point amongst many
Members, some of whom feel that the
Australian Government is virtually forc-
ing the Papuans to accept New Guinea
status and not allowing the New Guin-
eans to acquire Papuan status.
It is against this background that .Mr
Holloway’s bill will be discussed and
debated. And out of the debate might
well come some important clues to the
thinking of some of the Members. After
all, some argue, Mr Guise’s committee
does not have the right to assume that
the country will elect to become in-
dependent. What if it were to opt for
some sort of union with Australia?
If the Holloway Bill is defeated Mr
Guise and his committee might well give
thought to a recent suggestion by Labor’s
Mr Kim Beazley in the House of Rep-
resentatives. Mr Beazley called for the
establishment of an Administrator’s
Council consisting of indigenous mem-
bers from outside the House of Assem-
bly. Furthermore, Mr Beazley believed
that the Territory would be more likely
to gain stability from the US Presi-
dential system than it would from the
Australian system. Said Mr Beazley, “At
present, elections in Papua-New Guinea
are not putting into the Parliament in-
digenous educated members. The people
tend to vote for the local ‘father figures’.”
If the Administrator were to choose
indigenous ministers who were not par-
liamentarians, and if the elected members
acted as a Congress, there would be
opportunity for all to exercise a real
parliamentary function. Under the sys-
tem he proposed Mr Beazley felt that
the most able native members could be
used in the Cabinet whereas now, in the
piesent immaturity of the electorate, they
were not likely to be elected.
Mr Beaz'ey’s assessment of the pre- I
sent position is undoubtedly correct, but
it is widely believed by the Members
themselves that only a handful of them
will be elected in 1968. This being so, j
many of the young men of talent in the |
community may be elected. But because
these men are out of touch with their j
villages there may merely be a new
batch of “father figures”. If there was I
some guarantee of the younger and abler
men being elected, then the Westminster
model of Government would be as adapt-
able to the Territory as the American.
DEFENCE
Back to
Coral Sea
When a fire in one of its boiler rooms i
knocked out the 43,000-ton British air-'
craft carrier, HMS “Ark Royal”, from j
the Australian initiated “Exercise War- 1
rior”, the Australian Navy lost a golden j
opportunity to press further its case for I
a strike-carrier to replace HMAS “Mel-
bourne”. j
If Ark Royal had participated in
“Warrior”, the largest peace-time com-
bined operation between naval and air
groups in Australian waters since the
Coral Sea, it would have had vital bear-
ing on the Australian Navy’s case. The
carrier’s 600 mph Scimitar and Bucca-
neer aircraft undoubtedly would have
tested Australia’s East Coast defences,
and taxed to the full the ability of the
1500 mph plus Mirages to combat low- 1
flying planes. Then, in the final stages of j
“Warrior”, these carrier aircraft were to
have attempted to hit the Royal Austra-1
ban Air Force Mirage fighter base at Wil-
liamtown, near Newcastle.
Senior Naval officers pointed out it
was this kind of low-level strike which
allowed Canberra fighter-bombers to
break through supersonic radar directed
protection during the recent Exercise
Pacific Concord, in which contingents
from the United States Air Force, the
RAAF, and the Royal New Zealand Air
Force took part. There was considerable
criticism when five attacks by the Can-
berras scored “direct hits” on vital East
Coast communications by sneaking under
the screen provided by the Brookvale
radar control and reporting unit.
But the withdrawal of Britain’s second,
largest aircraft carrier, while disappoint-1
ing the joint directors, Rear-Admiral T.
K. Morrison (operating from command!
headquarters in Sydney) and Air Vice-
Marshal C. T. Hannah (operating from
the Townsville air base), made small
difference to the actual exercise. It still
gave the authorities valuable experience

in convoy duty, and anti-submarine war-
fare which would be one of the main
concerns of Australia’s defence planners
in the event of hostilities spreading in
South-East Asia. The American Pacific
Fleet claims more than 120 modern
Soviet submarines are patrolling the Paci-
fic, the Polar caps, and in areas where
American forces are Operating.
Altogether 4000 men, 12 surface
ships including the Royal Navy’s guided
missile destroyer HMS Devonshire, the
frigates HMS Euryalus, Whitby and
Barrosa, and Australian vessels HMAS
Sydney, Anzac, Yarra and Parramatta,
together with an undisclosed number of
submarines from the United States, Bri-
tish and Australian forces, took part.
The 40,000-ton American tanker USS
Ponchatoula accompanied the Australian
ships on convoy duty. RAAF formations
assigned two Neptune Maritime recon-
naissance squadrons, Canberra bombers
of the No. 82 Wing. Mirages and Sabre
jet-fighters of the No. 81 wing, a Blood-
hound surface-to-air missile squadron
and a radar control reporting unit.
Australia’s need for convoy protection
(which will not be available until HMAS
Melbourne acquires United States' Sky-
hawk aircraft in 1968) was emphasised
in the first major clash of the exercise.
The operational room in Sydney admitted
a successful “strike” on an American-
Australian convoy which included the
troop carrier HMAS Sydney and the
40,000 ton US tanker Ponchatoula.
Early reports from the “Warrior”
command in Sydney said no successful
attacks had been made on the convoy
by submarines “even though the ships
were in an area of intense submarine
activity”. According to the joint direc-
tors this was due to the vigilance of the
anti-submarine escorts HMAS Yarra,
Parramatta and Anzac , and the close
support given by RAF Shackletons. For
six days long range maritime aircraft of
the RAAF, RAF and USN patrolled
the sea lanes. Then in the late stages it
was acknowledged in Sydney that the
submarines had managed to pierce this
defensive screen and come within attack-
ing distance of the convoy.
While the exercise, which ends this
week, was not the spectacular it prom-
ised. it did provide the three allied
navies with valuable experience in
tactical - hunt - and - destroy operations
against enemy submarines.

The 14 Steps
The Sydney University scandal
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
Once in about every decade a particular act of injustice, brutality, or deceit offer*
itself as a palpable example of an established or burgeoning malignancy in some of
our important institutions. What is inevitably going to be known as the Knopfelmacher
“case” will surely go down in our national history as the example of the mid-’sixties.
The “case” of his rejection from
Sydney University has now become so
notorious that it has been raised as an
issue of public importance in three Aus-
tralian Parliaments; most recently in the
Commonwealth Parliament, and in both
Houses. Last Thursday in the House of
Representatives Mr Kevin Cairns and
Mr W. C. Wentworth spoke strongly
against the stand taken by the Profes-
sorial Board of the University of Sydney.
Speaking during the adjournment debate
Mr Cairns asked the Prime Minister
to make available to Parliament the
relevant portions of the minutes of a
Professorial Board meeting in which the
application of Dr
Knopfelmacher was
rejected.
The day before
the Knopfelmacher
case was discussed
in the Senate. The
Minister - in -
Charge of Common-
wealth Activities in
Education ancK Re-
search was asked by
Senator McManus:
“Has the Minister
noted that the Uni-
versity has repeated
what the Australian
Nobel Prize winner,
Sir John Eccles, de-
scribed as “a revolting injustice" by again
rejecting the application of Dr Frank
Knopfelmacher for a philosophy post?
Hansard (November 17) records the
following among Senator Gorton’s reply:
“Senator Gorton If that is true, it
would open up the question of why the
Professorial Board, having been given
that testimonial, would over-ride the
recommendation of Professor Armstrong
and his confreres. That would appear to
have been done for other than academic
reasons for political reasons (my
italics). If this refusal has taken place
as the result of the expression of some
views the views expressed by Dr
Knopfelmacher in this case would have
been anti-Communist views it would
appear to be quite a severe infringement
of academic freedom ... I do not know
of any redress or any court to which a
person could appeal in these circum-
stances. But I would imagine that the
DR FRANK KNOPFELMACHER
academic community and the public
would seek to redress what appears to
be an injustice.”
Now that the Professorial Board and
Senate of Sydney University have re-
fused to appoint Dr Knopfelmacher to
the position of Senior Lecturer in the
Philosophy Department, it is time to
restate the basic facts of the case and
to describe the present state of the
argument. It may be as well to begin
with the latter. Some take the view that
the central issue involved is one of
academic freedom because it appears
that a man has been penalised for his
anti-Communist political views. Others
take the view that
the question in-
volved is more one
of academic justice
because a man has
been refused his
right to a job for
which he is quali-
fied, on the grounds
that he may stir up
ideological trouble
and personal un-
pleasantness.
A different at-
titude is shared by
those who believe
that what is at stake
is the right of a com-
munity of scholars
to decide whether or not a man's personal
conduct, apart from his politics or quali-
fications, may not be such as to constitute
a serious threat to the nature and pur-
poses of this community. Opposed to
this, there is the view that Sydney Uni-
versity and Dr Knopfelmacher have been
at least partly the victims of a Left-wing
plot executed by a skilled core of campus
manipulators.
One vocal minority claims that the
Professorial Board was never basically
concerned with anything more than the
question of Dr Knopfelmacher’s quali-
fications for the position, and that the
Board w'as quite justifiably not convinced
that he had them. At least one member
of the Board believes that it was unlikely
that Dr Knopfelmacher had the necessary
objectivity for a position in political
philosophy. Other members of the
Board believe that, because Dr Knopfel-
macher is strongly anti-Communist, he

must be utterly illiberal and therefore
intellectually unworthy of a position on
the humanities staff.
One could go on for some time but
it may be better to look at some of the
obvious data of the case. The following
are facts which, after investigation, I
accept as being established beyond any
reasonable doubt.
1. Professor D. M. Armstrong, be-
cause of his estimation of Dr Knopfel-
macher’s intellectual gifts and compet-
ence, invited Dr Knopfelmacher to apply
for the position of Senior Lecturer in
Philosophy a position in which he
would be required to work mostly in
Political Philosophy.
2. When it became known that Dr
Knopfelmacher had applied for this
position a number of men on the staff
of the University began to compile a
case against his appointment, and to
distribute and disseminate, both verbally
and on paper, examples from his writings,
stories about his political beliefs, and
rumors about his alleged habit of in-
vective, calculated to bring Dr Knopfel-
macher into discredit.
3. Some of the men who campaigned
in this way against Dr Knopfelmacher
have long histories of being associated
with Communists and with Communist
front organisations.
4. Members of the Selection Com-
mittee were approached by some of the
above agitators in an endeavor to
persuade them against Dr Knopfel-
macher’s appointment.
5. The Selection Committee at its
third meeting decided unanimously, with
one member abstaining, to recommend
to the Professorial Board that Dr Knop-
felmacher be appointed.
6. Of the other applicants for the
position only two merited much atten-
tion and neither had a single publica-
tion in Political Philosophy, nor any
special qualifications in Political Philo-
sophy, nor an academic record as out-
standing as that of Dr Knopfelmacher.
7. The only article by Dr Knopfel-
macher circulated to members of the
Professorial Board was concerned not
with philosophy but with a political
situation which Dr Knopfelmacher
alleged existed at another university.
This was also the only article by Dr
Knopfelmacher with which a number of
members of the Board were familiar.
8. At the first meeting of the Board
a Professor from a technical faculty
accused Dr Knopfelmacher of being a
“McCarthyist”.
9. At the second meeting of the
Board he called Dr Knopfelmacher a
“Goldwaterite”.
10. For the first time in the remem-
bered history of the Sydney University
an applicant recommended by a Selection
Committee was rejected without the


matter being referred back to the Selec-
tion Committee.
11. It is rare for the Professorial
Board even to query a nearly unanimous
recommendation by a Selection Com-
mittee.
12. No evidence was produced at the
Professorial Board meetings that Dr
Knopfelmacher’s academic teaching was
biased or lacking in competence.
13. The Selection Committee, after
thoroughly reappraising the situation,
firmly decided that Dr Knopfelmacher
was a brilliant lecturer, that he was per-
fectly objective and competent in his
academic work, and that his publications
were adequate to justify the position for
which he was recommended. The Com-
mittee also called for reports on Dr
Knopfelmacher’s abilities from three
more referees, chosen by the Committee
itself. These three references were highly
favorable to Dr Knopfelmacher.
14. But a majority of the Committee
last week refused to recommend Dr
Knopfelmacher to the position to which
he is entitled and which the Head of the
Department wishes him to fill.
Of the many facts which may be estab-
lished about the case these would appear
to be some of the more central. They
lead me to the following conclusions:
(a) Without it being necessary to de-
scribe the non-appointment of Dr Knop-
felmacher as simply a Left-wdng plot, the
point must be made that the Professorial
Board w'ould probably not have ques-
tioned the recommendations of the Selec-
tion Committee if it had not been for
the agitation begun and the rumors
started by a number of senior academics
who may be fairly described as Dr Knop-
felmacher’s political opponents.
(b) Apart from the Leftists on the
Professorial Board, who wanted to bar
Dr Knopfelmacher simply for political
reasons, a number of Sydney professors
proved themselves incapable of under-
standing the source of the most obvious
factional pressure being applied in their
institution, or of withstanding the most
blatantly apparent appeal to prevailing
academic political prejudices.
(c) When the question of the article
on Melbourne University which Dr
Knopfelmacher wrote arose, the majority
of the Professorial Board was unable to
summon up the dignity, courtesy, or
courage to inquire into (i) How many
of the allegations made by Dr Knopfel-
macher were true, or even possible;
(ii) How typical this article was of Dr
Knopfelmacher’s academic writings; (iii)
How typically this article displayed Dr
Knopfelmacher’s personality.
In other words they proved themselves
both incompetent and gutless. This is
the situation in the University of Sydney
today.
PLAIN ENGLISH
A Revolting Injustice
The unanswerable case for an Appeals Tribunal
Tt is not surprising that the Prime
Minister should have said last
week that “I would like to consider
the Knopfelmacher matter very care-
fully”. It raises fundamental ques-
tions and any measures which the
Government may take will have to be
carefully thought out. Traditionally
the community and the Governments
have respected the academics’ right to
make their own decisions on academic
matters because they are the best
judges of academic qualifications and
they should not be subjected to
political or non-academic social pres-
sures. In turn the academics have
generally shown themselves worthy of
the unusual—indeed unique—privilege
of being the only group in the country
whose work is financed by the public,
but who are never called on to ac-
count for their actions to the public.
The Knopfelmacher case has shat-
tered the basis of this mutual trust at
least at Sydney University. Here we
have a candidate who is, according to
the head of the relevant department,
well qualified for the position he seeks,
is a brilliant lecturer, and has adequate
publications to support his application.
But he was rejected first by the Pro-,
fessorial Board after a disgraceful
political campaign against him and
now by the Selection Committee for
reasons which are not yet public, but
which since the new overseas and
Australian referees supported Dr
Knopfelmacher may reasonably be
presumed to be as unacademic as the
Professorial Board’s.
Senator Gorton said last week,
speaking as Minister in Charge of
Commonwealth Activities in Educa-
tion, that “I would imagine that the
academic community and the public
would seek to redress” what Sir John
Eccles has called “a revolting in-
justice”. But he was no more definite
than the Prime Minister as to what it
is that the public or the academics
should do and for the same reason:
that a flouting of academic principles
by academics is fortunately an unusual
situation requiring, as the Prime Mini-
ster said, careful consideration. Never-
theless, something must be done.
The Bulletin considers that the
Knopfelmacher affair renders un-
answerable the case for the introduc-
tion of an Appeals Tribunal to handle
complaints by applicants for academic
positions and that it should be intro-
duced urgently so that Dr Knopfel-
macher may take advantage of it.
There are two arguments against such
a tribunal. The first is that it would
encourage every unsuccessful appli-
cant to appeal to it and it would soon
become bogged down with trivial
appeals. In fact of course this is most
unlikely to happen and in any case
could be prevented by limiting appeals
to those from unsuccessful applicants
who have the support of a Professor in
his subject in one of the universities.
This would obviously rule out frivolous
complaints but give the right of appeal
to men like Dr Knopfelmacher, or for
that matter, Dr Colin Clark, to
mention another distinguished teacher
whom Sydney University academics
have managed to exclude.
The second objection is that an
Appeals Tribunal would represent an
outside influence on universities to
which the answer is of course it
would. This only becomes a serious
point if there is a risk that a Tribunal
would undermine academic values. In
fact it should be seen as a way of
strengthening them. The plain truth
is that there are many people outside
universities teachers, lawyers, doc-
tors, scientists, industrialists who
have a better understanding and ap-
preciation of academic values than
many academics themselves, certainly
than many of those at Sydney Uni-
versity. Naturally if the wrong people
were appointed much harm could be
done, but this merely means that great
care should be taken in the appoint-
ments. One can make various sugges-
tions. The Tribunal should, for ex-
ample, be selected by academics
though not exclusively from among
their own ranks. There should be
no Government representatives on the
Tribunal. The members should be
appointed for comparatively short
periods. They must make public the
reasons for their decisions.
The basic point, however, is that
Sydney University academics can no
longer expect to remain privileged to
commit a revolting injustice and then,
when called on to account for them-
selves to the public which maintains
them, to plead academic freedom.
After their treatment of Dr Knopfel-
macher, the days of that kind of Pod-
snappery are gone forever.

Computers today play a key role in finance, transportation, defence,
science, medicine in practically every industry and profession. They
are not widely understood, perhaps due to their amazing capabilities.
However, the computer is simply a tool. A tool that increases our

HOWTO
TALK IDA
COMPUTER
Just as you have various means for
communicating with other people
(letters, telegrams, telephones, etc.) so
you have various ways to communicate
with the computer. The major ways are:
PUNCHED CARDS. Punched cards have
many uses, such as college registration
cards, electricity bills, and pay-roll
data. They are cheap and versatile. The
standard punched card is called a
Hollerith card and it has 80 vertical
columns and can hold 80 characters of
information (letters, numbers etc.)
In the Hollerith punching system, one
punch in a single column (number row)
can represent any number from 0 to 9.
Above the nine number rows are three
zone rows: 0,11 and 12. By making two
punches in a single column one in a
zone row and the other in a number row,
it is possible to represent any letter of
the alphabet. Certain special characters
!/?*<{
S- KS-
can be represented by three punches in
a single column. A period is represented
by a 12 punch, a 3 punch and an 8
punch. The card shown contains punches
for the alphabet followed by punches
for numbers 0 through 9. Keep in mind
that Hollerith symbolic language must
be translated (it's done automatically)
into binary to be used by a computer.
PUNCHED PAPER TAPE. Punched tape is
cheap and easily stored in rolls. Some
kinds of business machines, including
typewriters and cash registers, can be
equipped to automatically punch paper
tape as they are used in normal business.
The resulting records can be easily fed
into computers for further processing.
MAGNETIC TAPE. Two major advantages
make magnetic tape the main recording
medium for computer data. It can hold
huge quantities of data a single 1
inch reel of tape can hold the contents
of 250,000 punched cards— and magnetic
tape can be read with lightning speed.
Some computers can read up to 120,000
characters a second from magnetic tap e
compared with only 1,200 characters a second
from punched cards
Rolls of magnetic tape serve as the com-
puter's external memory, just as books serve
as a person's external memory. Both provide
information as needed. In working many
problems computers require both fresh data
and stored data. In doing a payroll, for example,
the fresh information probably would be fed
into the computer from punched cards or paper
tape. In addition, the computer would need
certain basic facts, such as the employee's
rate of pay, income tax deductions and so
forth. This information would be kept on
magnetic tape to be fed into the computer's
internal memory as needed.
The magnetic tape used in a computer
system is similar to the kind used in a home
recorder. It is a plastic ribbon with an iron
oxide coating that can be magnetised. A tiny
area of oxide is magnetised to indicate a 1 in
binary code; a blank area in the pattern stands
for zero. A pattern of symbols is arranged in
vertical columns on tape, just as holes are
punched on a paper tape. One advantage of
magnetic tape is that its pattern of symbols
almost always is in "pure binary" and can be
read directly by the computer. The code
punched into paper tape may be punched in
binary. Or it may use a special code of its own,
as is the case with some telegraph punching
equipment. The illustration shows what the
magnetised spots on magnetic tape would look
like, if you could see them. Like tape used
on a home recorder, computer magnetic tape
can be easily erased and reused.
MAGNETIC DISCS. In place of external memory
units using magnetic tape, some computer
systems use magnetic discs. The discs, which
ook something like big phonograph records,
can make information available to the com-
ifirmrwwHr printed 1 vO'itlt mag-
netic ink are "read" in much the same way
magnetic tape is read. The additional advantage
of magnetic ink characters, which were
developed by General Electric, is that they can
be read by people, as well as by computers.
Today banks make wide use of magnetic ink
characters, particularly on cheques.
OPTICAL SCANNERS. If all numbers and words,
not just those printed in magnetic ink, could
be read by computers, it would save much of
the bother of translating information into
special codes for computer input. The com-
puter industry is working toward this kind of
versatility. An optical scanner has a set of
electronic patterns in its memory and a
photoelectric cell that scans material to be
read, converting characters into electronic

pulses. The scanner can “read” any character
that matches the patterns stored in its memory.
HIGH-SPEED PRINTING. This is the most
important medium for getting information out
of the computer. A high-speed printer whips
out information at as much as 1200 lines a
single minute. For you to turn out 1200 lines,
typing 60 words a minute on a typewriter,
would take eight hours. Types of information
turned out by the printer include accounting
forms, cheques and department store bills.
TYPEWRITER. As part of their control unit most
computers have an electric typewriter. Through
-grrscriV ~'tWo
through the typewriter short answers to
problems worked by the computer. If there is a
programming error, the computer may type out
information that enable the human operator to
make a correction.
DISPLAY LIGHTS. Some computers have a
section of lights than can instantly show what
information is in control, memory and the
arithmetic section. The display is in binary; if a
light is on, it is a 1; if it is off, it is a 0.
CATHODE RAY TUBE. Some kinds of scientific
problems worked by computers have answers
that are in curves and other lines. While these
answers can be printed, it is sometimes more
convenient to translate the information into an
image that is flashed on a cathode ray tube,
similar to a TV screen.

“AUSSIE COULDN'T CARE LESS"
The Myth of Anzac Union
By SAM LIPSKI
When Sir Walter Nash was a young
man in his native England at the
turn of the century, and had not
sailed across the oceans to New Zealand,
a select committee from Wellington
sailed across the Tasman to investigate
the possible entry by New Zealand into
the Commonwealth of Australia.
Now 83, the former Prime Minister
of New Zealand sat in the tea-rooms at
Parliament House in Wellington munch-
ing on sandwiches and assured me that
what had nearly happened then would
never happen. New Zealanders loved
their independence too much ever to
cede it to Australia. Sir Walter may be
a more zealous nationalist than most of
his countrymen who on the whole show
little sign of thinking seriously one way
or another about political union with
Australia. But whenever the question is
actually put to them, their attitude is
likely to be the same as his.
If New Zealanders are opposed to
the idea of giving up their political
sovereignty, there are very few Aus-
tralians (pace A. A. Cal well and W. C.
Wentworth) who would care passionately
about getting a new state or states 1300
miles across the sea.
Considering the lack of enthusiasm, it
is in one sense surprising that the myth
of Australasia, of Anzac union, has sur-
vived for so long. Yet myths have a way
of pointing to something basic which
nourishes them —in this case a tacit
acceptance by both Australians and New
Zealanders that their destinies are some-
how bound together. The strength of the
myth never strong enough to really
capture the popular imaginations of both
peoples—has waxed and waned in the
last 65 years. This year on August 31
it gained a new lease of life with the
signing of the bi-lateral Limited Free
Trade Agreement which raises some
tantalising questions.
On January 1, 1966, when the agree-
ment becomes effective, will we be enter-
ing a new and decisive era in trans-
Tasman relations? What are the chances
of an economic and defence union with-
out loss of political independence? Or
have the trumpets sounded too early?
The history of Australia-New Zealand
relations is a classic exercise in the study
of lost opportunities, and even now there
are not many signs that the more im-
portant lessons have been learnt. The
philosopher Santayana may not be pre-
scribed reading in Wellington or Can-
berra but his dictum that those who do
not learn from history are doomed to
relive it, might well be engraved over the
Speakers’ chairs in both Parliaments.
For 65 years relations between the two
Dominions have been distinguished by
a depressing lack of vision, a failure of
political nerve, and an absence of leader-
ship.
Instead of taking advantage of the
objective facts of history and geography
which were drawing the two countries
closer together, politicians on both sides
of the Tasman have succeeded instead
in building up a great reservoir of inertia.
This inertia is still there, waiting for a
Monnet or a Spaak to overcome it. In
the absence of such leadership it becomes
difficult to see the latest trade agree-
ment, and the growing discussion about
closer relationships, as anything more
than another chapter in the depressingly
familiar story of abortive agreements,
editorial hosannas, political platitudes
and deja vu enthusiasm.
11/leasured by the criteria of the outer
■** forms of co-operation which actually
exist between Australia and New Zealand
this would seem to be a harsh judgment.
We do, of course, have an unusually high
degree of togetherness. It is almost a
reflex response to think first of Gallipoli
and the ANZAC spirit, and then to rattle
off SEATO, ANZUS, ANZAM, our
common membership of the Common-
wealth, of ECAFE. Then there are the
ANZAAS conferences, our joint com-
mitment in Malaysia and Vietnam, our
close diplomatic relations at the UN and
between our South-East Asian embassies.
At the “people-to-people” level there
are 50,000 Kiwis in Sydney, and an
almost similar number of Aussies work-
ing their way through the New Zealand
Government hotels, tourist resorts, farms
and cities. (Never mind that hardly any
of the Aussies ever see anybody else but
other Aussies and that most of the Kiwis
have created their own ghetto at Bondi.)
There are even more tangible ties; New
Zealand is the biggest market for Aus-
tralian-manufactured goods, and with the
new jet-services of Air-New Zealand and
other airlines Auckland is less than three
hours away from Sydney.
But measured by what the two coun-
tries could be doing in a closer economic
and defence union, the significant thing
is not our togetherness, but our separate-
ness. Indeed, what the historians or social
scientists coming to the study of New
Zealand-Australian relations (if any of
them ever come to it) must do, is not so
much to explain why we are as close as
we are, but why we are as estranged as
we are. Some examples:
It has taken 65 years to get a limited
free trade agreement, but this is by no
means the first attempt at such an
arrangement and even now the emphasis
is very much on the “limited”. There is
no joint planning in industrial develop-
ment, in commerce, in banking, in any
essential services like civil aviation or
communications. Six years ago the Aus-
tralian Tariff Board suggested that the
Australian ship-building industry, with
the help of a Commonwealth subsidy,
should be able to take orders to build
ships for the New Zealand trade. And it
is five years since the New Zealand Gov-
ernment suggested that there should be
a joint* trans-Tasman shipping service,
Nothing has happened.
In defence relations New Zealand
officers train at Duntroon, there are
regular staff conferences, and in Vietnam
and Malaysia there is close co-ordination
of the fighting commands. Yet we are
very far from complete co-ordination of
defence planning and strategy, our equip-
ment procurement policies are different
and so is much of our new equipment,
Our training is. different. If anything,
the differences are increasing, not only as
Australia’s defence expenditure becomes
relatively far greater than that of New
Zealand's, which it has always been, but
as the Australian arms build-up reaches
a point of sophistication which a
minuscule New Zealand defence budget
of £SO million could not hope to match,
Essentially, the failure of the two
countries to come closer together has
been a political failure. The traditional
explanation for the failure which puts it
down to a few thousand Australian dairy
farmers who do not know how to milk a
cow, and a few hundred New Zealand
manufacturers who have not yet heard of
the assembly line, misses the point. This
is more result than cause of the im-
potence of governments in coping with
vested interests, which naturally tend to
become more entrenched with time,

tions of small pressure groups (which
have since become larger pressure groups)
shows best the strange paralysis which
seems to grip the politicians—a paralysis
which at the Australian end might
partially be explained in terms of the
Country Party, but only partially. It was
a Labor Government, and an activist
Labor Government, which in 1944 had
a great chance to lay the foundations for
a Tasman community, but failed.
The Second World War had brought
the two countries together. Both had
experienced the traumas of Singapore’s
fall and the conflict with Britain on
defence priorities. So in 1944 the Can-
berra Pact included provisions for per-
manent machinery for closer co-opera-
tion. It covered nearly everything that
the most enthusiastic devotee of greater
union could have asked. The agreement
planned for the co-ordination of policy
for the production of munitions, aircraft
and supply items, and for shipping; there
was to be consultation and joint plan-
ning in the development of commerce
and industry; co-operation on achieving
full employment and the highest stan-
dards of social security. It also provided
for something which previous agreements
on trade relations had lacked suitable
machinery to ensure that the agreement
worked.
Thus there were to be conferences of
Ministers at least twice a year as well as
periodic conferences of departmental
officers, standing inter - governmental
committees and a regular exchange of
information and officials. There was
even to be a permanent Australia-New
Zealand Affairs Secretariat (an idea which
has now again been revived in New
Zealand and without which union will
always remain a dream). In fact, the
1944 Agreement was an abysmal failure.
SPHERE were only a few desultory meet-
A ings, the last one of the ministerial
conferences taking place in November,
1944. It took another 21 years before
the two countries came around to sign-
ing another agreement.
Who remembers the Canberra Pact
today? And yet in many ways it was a
far more ambitious attempt than the
present trade agreement. Of course, the
1944 Agreement was not the first time
that the two countries had tried to get
closer together and its collapse has to
be seen in the light of the atmosphere
of failure, resentment and suspicion
which the previous 40 years had bred.
When the Second World War ended,
and the external threats and pressures
eased, both countries turned inwards to
reconstruction and post-war development,
apparently unable to see what greater
regional co-operation would have meant.
Again it took the pressure of external
events and developments to arouse them.
In June, 1958, after it had become clear
that the European Common Market was
more than just an idealistic dream, the
Australian and New Zealand Prime
Ministers announced that a complete
review of trade relations between the
two countries would take place as soon
as possible.
It was not, however, until April, 1964,
that a Joint Standing Committee of
officials presented a report outlining a
possible agreement. As the New Zealand
Government publication points out, what
followed was a most intensive series of
consultations in New Zealand, “with
upwards of 180 trade organisations and
individual producers about the effect of


the free trade arrangement on the
industries concerned”. And this took
another 16 months before the agreement
finally was signed.
Obviously the mistrust of New
Zealand manufacturers and primary pro-
ducers for their Australian counterparts
could not be dispelled by legislative fiat
overnight, after it had been allowed to
develop for more than a half a century
allowed to develop, it should be added
in fairness, by Australian governments
too quick to give in to limited local
interests, and unable to see the long-term
advantages of concessions to the smaller
New Zealand interests.
Psychologists sometimes speak of
“approach-avoidance” conflicts where
an object attracts and repels at the same
time. Today, after the failure-marked
history of stretching their hands across
the Tasman and feeling that they have
had them chopped off except when it has
suited Australia to grasp them, New
Zealanders still seem to be in a classic
approach-avoidance situation, despite
the new trade agreement.
I think, for instance, of a remarkable
conversation with Sir Walter Nash,
spilling over with memories of his talks
with Roosevelt, Cordell Hull, Curtin,
Chifley, Dulles, Churchill and King
George VI. Still politically active as the
Labor MP for Hutt, Sir Walter was
eager to talk about Australia. From the
vantage-point of a long life, most of
it actively involved in politics, Sir Walter
showed the ambivalence towards Aus-
tralians characteristic of many New
Zealanders an ambivalence which
revolves around the polarities of trust-
suspicion, affection-resentment, superior-
ity-inferiority.
An umbilical cord
TI/henever I mentioned that I had
spoken to Sir Walter, New Zea-
landers smiled benignly and said Sir
Walter was a nice old man but spoke for a
New Zealand that was passing. In his in-
sistence that New Zealand still had to rely
on Britain as a market for her primary
products, that nothing must ever be
done which would imperil that market,
and that, spiritually, New Zealanders
were still tied to Britain, Sir Walter may
not have been speaking for all of the
younger generation although 1 heard
the expression “going home” more than
once from New Zealanders not yet 30
for since the Common Market
negotiations, and the revelations about
New Zealand's vulnerability, the umbili-
cal cord, if not quite broken, has been
stretched pretty far.
But one thing is certain Australia
has not yet come to fill the gap, either
as a trading partner or as a spiritual
surrogate for Britain. In speaking of
Australians with his mixed air of puck-
ish condescension and admiration, Sir
Walter’s was as typical a voice as I
heard in New Zealand on the subject.
There was gratitude. “I like Bob Men-
zies. One Saturday night in 1957 when
we were in trouble 1 flew over to Can-
berra. He loaned me £lO million.
He told Coombs do you know
Coombs? to fix it for me with our
Reserve Bank.” And there was pride.
“We paid it all back, of course.” There
was also mistrust. “Whenever we had a
product which looked as if it might
compete in Australia you put the tariff
on us.”
Sir Walter's mixed reaction to Aus-
tralians is only partly political. At all
levels New Zealanders will talk with
satisfaction of how Australians and New
Zealanders fight well in war together,
how they trust each other with their
lives. As in Australia the newspapers
tell of how Australian troops in Viet-
nam prefer to rely only on New Zealand
artillery and fire support; this is noted
with pleasure by a New Zealander busi-
nessman who fought in the last war with
the Australians. “It's true the Aussies
are the only ones you can take into the
jungle with you.” The same businessman
will then explain why Australian industry
will destroy New Zealand’s standard of
living if given the chance.
Army officers who find that they get
on well with their Australian opposite
numbers in battle, despair when it comes
to convincing the Australians in peace-
time. Although the two countries do
have some joint consultation in their
present approach to buying equipment,
the New Zealanders feel that the Aus-
tralian Army is buying different equip-
ment from that recommended by the
New Zealanders, out of “sheer cussed-
ness”. Businessmen who admire the
enterprise of Australian industry, its
scope and development compared with
their own, talk with a faint air of distaste
for the “pushy” Australian salesman.
One executive of a large Australian-
owned company explained that an Aus-
tralian salesman would arrive in the
morning and immediately begin seeing as
many clients as he could. “He will rush
around hard all day, trying to cram
everything in. New Zealand business
still operates at a much slower pace and
the pushiness of many Australian busi-
nessmen has led to some resentment.”
But the most interesting, if least
tangible, sort of ambivalence about Aus-
tralians is the general feeling of spiritual
superiority. lan Cross, a young Wel-
lington writer, believes that there is
generally a “colossal obliviousness” to
Australians on the part of most New
Zealanders. “But where there is any feel-
ing it is one of superiority.”
An Australian will sense this after
talking for any length of time about
the two countries. It is a feeling that
we have fallen victim to the idolatry
of affluence and materialism, that the
older pioneering virtues of self-reliance
and hard work have given way to soft
living; that we have become besotted not
only by beer, but by cappucino, and that
the great wave of immigration from
Europe has washed away all the Anglo-
Saxon virtues as well as the lamb-and-
mint sauce. In a country which has been
determinedly selective in its own immi-
gration programme,, and where only
2 per cent of the population other than
the Maoris are of non-British descent,
this is perhaps understandable.
The Qr'eat unknown
I>y contrast there is pride that New
Zealand has not whored after the
quick quid, has not sold out to foreigners.
There is pride also in the welfare state
model which New Zealand has built
which is seen as a more advanced society
than ours; and there is pride in the
prominence that individual New
Zealanders have achieved in Australia.
But “Aussie” (Australia the country, not
only the people, is known as “Aussie”
in New Zealand) remains the great
unknown to those who have not seen it.
One agency which could have helped
to break down the gulf would have been
a progressive and enlightened Press. Here
Maurice Shadbolt’s recent criticism in
The Bulletin of the parochial quality
of the New Zealand Press is relevant.
While some newspapers have occasion-
ally run thoughtful editorials on the need
to consider an economic and defence
union the “Auckland Star” has been
particularly advanced in this discussion
the general coverage given to Aus-
tralia is of doubtful value in helping
New Zealanders to see what might be
involved. A striking example of the way
some of the newspapers are quite happy
to allow New Zealanders to live with
their prejudices was the way the Wel-
lington “Dominion” gave a whole page
to one of its columnists last month who
in breathless prose gave an unintention-
ally hilarious report of an eight-day
“jet-set” visit to Kings Cross, the poker
machines at the Sydney Journalists’ Club,
and the vagaries of Melbourne’s used-
car salesmen. His concluding line was
“This was Australia . .
It ought to be said, again in fairness,
that the Australian Press coverage of
New Zealand is far worse. There is not
one resident correspondent for any Aus-
tralian newspaper in New Zealand and
the amount of space given to New
Zealand affairs would probably be less
than that given to Belgium or Holland —
except, of course, when there are gaol
riots or multiple births.
If the Press has done little to help
New Zealanders see beyond their borders

then their politicians have been equally
remiss. It may be hard for some Aus-
tralians to accept but the standard of
political discussion and argument is
much lower in Wellington than in Can-
berra. Professional men, individuals
who have achieved some distinction in
other spheres except party politics, or
politicians who have reached more than
the minimum standards of education,
are rarer in the New Zealand Parliament
than in most State Parliaments of Aus-
tralia. The National Party, theoretically
laisezz-faire, has shown a surprising
degree of state interference. The Labor
Party has been a colorless opposition,
offering neither choice nor echo.
Among the members of the National
Party Government, however, it seems
that some of the suspicions about Aus-
tralia have died down and in one or
two cases there is even positive
enthusiasm for closer ties. Commenting
on the Trade Agreement to The Bulle-
tin the Prime Minister, Mr K. Holyoake,
made the point that the details of the
agreement were not as important as the
willingness shown by the two countries
to move closer together. He was hope-
ful that other areas of trade would
emerge as the agreement was imple-
mented.
But, he thought, political union would
be “a loss rather than a gain, in that
national characteristics would inevitably
be submerged”.
The Minister responsible for the face-
to-face negotiations with Mr McEwen
is a quietly spoken but reportedly firm
negotiator, Mr J. Marshall. He, too, was
hopeful, if guarded, about the prospects
of greater trade. But he felt that there
had been a definite change of heart - on
the part of the Australians. “I recall
quite clearly that when negotiations
started in this very room with Mr
McEwen in 1963 we were nowhere near
our present state of understanding and
agreement. I feel Australia wants to see
a prosperous New Zealand.”
One Cabinet Minister who has gone
further than any other politician in New
Zealand is significantly the Minister for
Defence, Mr Dean Eyre. In a speech
which was for once widely quoted in
Australia he said, “Our children would
never forgive us if we did not work
towards greater co-operation with Aus-
tralia. Great enterprises have always had
simple beginnings and this agreement
is the beginning of a great enterprise.”
Mr Eyre admitted that he was going
further than his own Cabinet Ministers
and certainly far beyond the Labor
Party Opposition in talking of a federa-
tion between the two countries. Other
National Party politicians privately take
the view, as do some New Zealand
economists, that the Trade Agreement,
despite the openings it has given the
New Zealand forest products industry
in Australia, is surrounded by too many
escape clauses and does not include very
many important products in the 60 per
cent of trade it covers. But most accept
that it is a start and will be judging the
treatment of forest products by Aus-
tralia as a crucial test case, an indication
of how serious Australia really is about
closer trade relations.
The attitude of the Labor Party
Opposition is puzzling. Where it might
have been expected that there would
have been some sympathy for the views
of Australian Labor Party leaders like
Mr Calwell (who admittedly favors the
extreme of political union) or Mr G.
Whitlam, who has visited New Zealand
and has spoken constructively in Parlia-
ment on the subject, there is in fact
suspicion and hostility.
Mr Arnold Nordmeyer, 64, and the
Labor Party’s leader since Sir Walter
Nash resigned in 1963, does not want
the two countries to get together. He
remains unconvinced that they could
without New Zealand suffering. In his
view any country with facilities for mass
production on the scale of Australia
would always swamp a country with a
smaller population like New Zealand,
To the literature of trans-Tasman
epithets, Mr Nordmeyer last year con-
tributed his classic remark: “The Aus-
tralians take us for a bunch of suckers”.
Despite the concessions, which the New
Zealand Government claims Australia
has made for New Zealand forest pro-
ducts in the agreement, Mr Nordmeyer
is convinced that the “Aussie as always
stays an Aussie”.
He cites the way in which Mr
McEwen specifically excluded the pos-
sibility of considering dairy products
in any discussion on freer trade. “There
can be no real hope because you are
not prepared to do the right thing. The
trade agreement will in effect widen the
trade gap.” He agrees that New Zealand
industry is, as yet, equally unready to
make the kind of concessions necessary
for wider freer trade. But this is, he
feels, a fact of life in the two countries.
New Zealand has about 600 unemployed
one of the lowest rates in the world—
and this would be threatened if New


kealand manufacturers were exposed to
[competition. He sees the two countries
proceeding along parallel lines of
development lines which never meet,
j. If the Labor Party came to power it
Would take steps to renegotiate the
|agreement. In defence, Mt Nordmeyer
| feels that there could be closer co-opera-
'tion greater integration of the two
[navies for instance. Mr Nordmeyer’s
l “Little New Zealand” attitude may not
jbe completely shared in his own party
and there are some sections which are
(keen to encourage closer relations with
Australia. The Federation of Labor, for
instance, has had close contact with the
/Australian Council of Trade Unions and
is in some ways less rigid than the
political wing. But the Labor Party is un-
likely to be the source of initiative for
union with Australia —at least in the
foreseeable future.
I While neither of the political parties
/has come up with a programme for
union with Australia, even in limited
■ form, there are some indications that
I groups of economists, academics, and
[consultants to industry and commerce
ihave been discussing the question in
[detail something that has not hap-
pened in Australia.
f The most comprehensive published
jdiseussion of what an economic and
[defence union could mean, and some
pecific suggestions on how such a union
ould be brought into being, has come,
ignificantly enough, from a New
lealander, Dr A. D. Robinson, a
[political scientist at Victoria University,
Earlier this year he pub-
fished a pamphlet entitled “Towards a
Gasman Community”, under the auspices
(of the New Zealand Institute of
Economic Research which has also pub-
dished another paper on the pros and
cons of Free Trade.
Tasman community
Robinson points out that the extent
of co-operation envisaged in the
combined economic and defence union
is considerable. It would involve, on the
[economic side, a common market for
commodities and production, a common
[tariff, and some degree of co-ordination
/in national economic policies, and on
the defence side a co-ordination of
defence planning and strategy, equip-
ment procurement policies, the stand-
ardisation of training, equipment, and
command systems. As far as possible,
it would mean the alignment of foreign
policy but he does not envisage political
amalgamation. “What is implied is con-
certed action by two independent part-
ners, based on their common interests.”
i Outlining the advantages of an
economic union Dr Robinson points out,
*fst, that a larger market would increase
Productivity in the union by promoting
suitable economies of scale, by encourag-
ing specialisation of production and by
stimulating competition among firms
and thereby improving efficiency,
eliminating inefficient producers, and
countering monopolies. Admitting to the
dangers to New Zealand unless union
was accompanied by Government
supervision, Dr Robinson believes that
co-ordinated Government action could
offset them. “Indeed, an economic union
between Australia and New Zealand
could well be considered as both a
larger market and development alliance.”
Secondly, Dr Robinson maintains that
an economic union would reduce the
vulnerability of the region to fluctua-
tions in overseas markets and might,
incidentally, help eliminate the foreign
exchange bottleneck which has held back
New Zealand development in the last
decade.
Thirdly, an economic union could
increase the bargaining strength of Aus-
tralia and New Zealand as a region in
competition with other major unities in
world trade like the European Common
Market, Japan and The United States.
Both countries, not only the smaller,
coWd benefit. One of New Zealand’s
leading economists, Professor S. W.
Holmes, is a strong supporter of regional
free trade. In a seminar paper given at
Victoria University, where he is Pro-
fessor of Economics, Professor Holmes
said: “Australia is confronted with diffi-
culties not by any means dissimilar from
New Zealand’s. Her rate of growth, like
ours, is by no means high by world
standards. She, too, has a vulnerable
economy, with its rate of growth still
fairly heavily dependent on the country’s
capacity to maintain an adequate rate
of increase of imports. And her home
market, though a good deal larger than
ours, is still relatively small.”
Dr Robinson points out that the
arguments for .an economic union are
more persuasive when they are con-
sidered in the context of the defence
considerations an increasingly belli-
cose China, the instability of Indonesia,
and the doubts about the British or even
the American presence which are
likely to be the main political induce-
ments for closer relations between the tw'o
countries. Furthermore, writes Dr
Robinson, not only would it be more
efficient to plan military expenditure to
avoid costly duplication of equipment,
but there is also the consideration that
“in the modern world economics and
defence potential are so closely con-
nected, that progress simultaneously on
both fronts is likely to be mutually rein-
forcing”. Another argument for such a
union is that it would be given much
greater attention than a limited union
“and thereby help to stimulate the
growth of a deeper regional conscious-
ness; without this neither economic nor
defence integration is likely to proceed
very far.”
In Dr Robinson’s view, and history
seems to reinforce it, the only way in
which the benefits of union could
properly be achieved is to ensure that
there is an institutional framework which
will be the basis for future negotiations.
He claims, validly, that the traditional
approach between Governments and
Ministers has been inadequate for the
task. He quotes the example of Western
Europe to make the point that the way
nations act are a result of their national
political processes. There has to be an
organisation which transcends them. And
using the European experience as a
model he suggests a whole series of
institutions, consisting of inter-Govern-
mental committees, an independent
secretariat with powers to initiate policy
proposals, a parliamentary consultative
assembly, an economic advisory body and
an investment bank.
There are external forces at work in
the development of both countries which
might make Dr Robinson's proposals
more than just an academic conversation-
piece. But in New Zealand there are
also some internal ones which, in time,
might lead to some sort of ground-swell
of opinion in favor of union. They exist
in embryonic form in the feeling
among a growing and disparate minority
that the country has been over-governed,
that recent legislation like the News
Media Bill and the Narcotics Bill (giving
police special powers to enter homes) are
dangerous tendencies, that the wall of
economic and cultural protectionism
w'hich has been built up in the past
generation no longer serves any purpose,
that initiative and foreign investment
must be encouraged, that the brain-drain
of young talent must be halted, and that
all these problems could at least partially
be solved by an imaginative union with
Australia.
Whatever dissatisfactions there are in
Australia, there is not the same feeling
that union with New Zealand could
solve many of the problems. Yet the
advantages of regional co-operation are
at least worth greater investigation and
discussion than they have received.
Earlier this year. Liberal back-
bencher Mr H. B. Turner moved that
the Government should “seriously and
urgently explore the practicability of
establishing a Common Market with
New Zealand”. A bi-partisan vote
accepted the motion with no opposition.
Since then Mr McEwen has announced
the Limited Trade Agreement in Parlia-
ment. But the Agreement has not been
debated and will not be debated before
the current session ends. It will do noth-
ing to dispel the view in New Zealand
that, basically, “Aussie couldn’t care less”.


Golfomania
A travelling circus?
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
There is a standard type of golf joke.
A “New Yorker” cartoon version
of it some years back depicted a
couple of golfers surprised, just as they
are about to drive for the second green,
by a bustling and portly middle-aged
chap who strides up exclaiming: “Mind
if I play through? My wife’s having a
pretty tricky operation and I’d like to
get to the hospital as soon as I can.”
Another form of the golf joke shows
two men on a putting green, one holding
the flag, the other crouched over his
putter. In the background is the rising
mushroom cloud of a nuclear blast and
a city crumbling to ashes. The golfer
holding the flag says to his partner: “Go
ahead and putt. The shock wave won’t
reach us for another few minutes.”
The golf joke is based on the game’s
power to take over the personalities of
its players, and to become an obsession.
Stephen Leacock describes such an
obsession in his story “The Golfo-
maniac”. The narrator of the tale is
travelling by train with a golfomaniac,
and, after many attempts to turn the con-
versation away from golf, he wilts and
refers to the morning paper: “Did you
read about this extraordinary murder
case on Long Island?”
“No,” replies the golfomaniac, “I
never read murder cases.”
“I know, but in this case it seems that
the man was killed with a blow from a
golf club.”
“I wonder if it was an iron let me see
the paper though, for the matter of
that, I imagine that a blow from even
a wooden driver, let alone one of the
steel-handled drivers where does it
say it? Pshaw, it only says, ‘A blow
from a golf club’. It’s a pity the papers
don’t write these things up in more detail,
isn’t it, but perhaps it will be better in
the afternoon paper—” And so on.
The golfomaniac is always a man of
theories about style, swing and power.
He is always able to tell you what was
the real secret of Hogan’s success, or of
Palmer’s phenomenal hitting. He is ever
regretting the fact that he never gets
enough time for the game. (“It’s hard
to leave the office before two,” he said.
“Something always turns up.”)
There must be something manic in
the construction of every golfer whether
he be touring professional, tournament
amateur or just a weekend swinger, for
the major fact about golf is that it is
such a hard game to play, and for most
people, almost impossible to play well.
Golf is an unnatural sort of game in
which the body is required to forget most
of its instinctual habits and impulses: it
was Ben Hogan, I think, who remarked
that the beginner would be best advised
to work out the most natural way for
him to hold the club, stand, and swing,
and then do the opposite.
But if golf is an unnatural and dif-
ficult game, it is also an old game. Tobias
Smollett relates in his novel “Humphrey
Clinker” back in 1771: “Hard by in the
fields called the links, the citizens of
Edinburgh divert themselves at a game
called golf, in which they use a curious
kind of bat tipped with horn, and small
elastic balls of leather, stuffed with
feathers, rather less than tennis balls,
but of a much harder consistency. These
they strike with such force and dexterity
from one hole to another, that they fly
to an incredible distance. Of this
diversion the Scots are so fond that,
when the weather will permit, you may
see a multitude of all ranks, from the
Senator of Justice to the lowest trades-
man, mingled together, in their shirts,
and following the balls with the utmost
eagerness.”
If Smollett thought that the distances
driven in his time were incredible, he
would be staggered at the distances driven
by some of the top professionals today.
Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus,
America’s best two players, regularly
drive 320 yards or farther. Improve-
ments in clubs and golf balls have en-
couraged the development of the power-
game and have radically altered course
architecture.
After Player won the American Open
Championship this year he was rated
with Walter Hagen, Bobby Jones, Sam
Snead and Ben Hogan, as one of the
greatest golfers of all time. Norman
Von Nida has written that “the South
African rates more than favorably with
them all”.
Player was treated with some suspicion
when he handed the 25,000 dollar
cheque, that goes with the American
Open, back to the USGA for the Anti-
Cancer Fund and to assist junior golf.
Like most top golfers Player is something
of a showman, and his gift was con-
sidered by certain sceptical sportswriters
to be mostly prompted by the desire for
publicity. Player sprang to his own
defence with the reminder that his
mother had died of cancer, and that he
had told the secretary of the United
States Golf Association in 1962 that, if
he were ever lucky enough to win the
Open, he would give the cheque to the
BRUCE DEVLIN
appeal. The size of the donation, how-
ever, is indication of the size of Player’s
private fortune. Like Nicklaus and
Arnold Palmer he has become a million-
aire through golf, and the Gary Player
Corporation has invested the money with
care.
T)ut the greatest revolution in modern
times has been the emergence of the
new class golfer, the touring professional,
a golfing machine who follows the nation-
al and international tournament circuit.
The man for whom the daily, almost un-
endurably monotonous, hours of practice
and the fierce nervous demands of the
big tournaments are matched by the
possibility of huge rewards. At the top
of the world’s professionals is Gary
Player, five feet seven inches, from South
Africa. Not yet 30 years of age, Player)
is able to boast that among his assets,
are a farm worth about £65,000, and a
black Cadillac imported from the USA
for 18,000 dollars. His annual pro-
fessional earnings are so large that he
now sponsors the South African PGA
title, worth £l5OO, out of his own
pocket.
“Dedication to the game” is an ex-
pression frequently used by eminent
golfers: it is the expression Player uses
most to explain his rise to become the
world’s reigning champion. He cheer-
fully claims that the reason why he is I
the best is that he has spent more time
on a golf course than anyone else. He
got his first job as an assistant at a golf j
course near Johannesburg and spent I
hours each day hitting balls around the |
course; but the constant practice, the
basis of his success, was only productive
because it was combined with great!
powers of concentration and physical!
fitness.
There is something far too close to
religion in Player’s dedication and zeal

I goods firms, clothing manufacturers,
'national and international advertisers of
'all kinds. The non-smoking, non-drink-
ing Player is used to promote the sales
of cigarettes and beer, among other
things.
|l Over the past five years there has been
ia virtual tournament of advertisers
battling to get the top golfers to endorse
•their products. Offers of up to £25,000
have been made for the use of a single
lidvertisement, plus the agreement not
''to work for competitors. The reasons
for this rush of money to the pockets of
I the top professionals was given by the
[president of one of America’s largest
f.breweries: “Golf,” he said, “is a nice-
image to be associated with.” Gridiron
and Rugby for heroes, cricket for artists,
but golf, apparently, for status. Golf is
not only the image to be associated with
when advertising clubs and balls, it also
helps sell or is believed to help sell
anything that may be remotely associated
w 'th fresh air, sunny days, long, smooth
drives from the tee, and acres of green,
®own grass. But whereas the money
PETER THOMSON
from the big tournaments is spread down
the line to a host of placegetters, sub-
stantial income from the advertisers is
only open to those at the very top.
An Australian who has recently
climbed into this company is Bruce
Devlin, the 28-year-old Canberra pro-
fessional. A former plumber, the tall,
slim Devlin won over £30,000 on the
American circuit this year—a record for
an Australian and, without doubt, a
handsome amount for anyone else. In
September Devlin underwent a severe
operation in Texas for varicose veins, but
despite this discomfort he returned to
Australia to come sixth, behind Player,
in the Australian Open, and win both of
the big commercial tournaments.
Devlin admits that the pressure of
playing the big circuits “flattens” him. He
dislikes the constant travel and the
nervous strain but is determined to stick
it out until about 35. Player claims that
by then Devlin will be the best golfer in
the game. Devlin
just comments, “This
kind of life takes too
much toll.” Both
Devlin and Player,
as well as Palmer
and Nicklaus, have
their golfing careers
managed by a young
Cleveland lawyer,
Mark McCormack,
whose main task is
to negotiate their
golfing and advertis-
:ng contracts. Mc-
Cormack is reputed
to drive a hard bargain which may partly
account for the fact that three of his
clients are now millionaires. He knows
better than anyone just how keen big
manufacturers are to get golf and golf
champions identified with their products.
So great is the skill of the world’s
present top golfers, and so vast is the
publicity and advertising network which
uses them, tournaments have lost some-
thing of their competitive atmosphere for
the golf follower and have become more
a part of a travelling circus of golfing
freaks and phenomena. Modern golf
writers deal more with individual strokes
and personal vagaries of golfers than
with golfing matches and encounters.
The leading tournaments are coming to
be seen more as contests between golfers
and the course architect, than as contests
between the contending champions. Re-
moved from this parade is the world of
the common golfer, battling to reduce
his handicap, half-loving, half-hating the
game. Despite its frustrations golf may
have a more important role than is
usually guessed. As an American writer
noted: “Golf is the esperanto of sport.
All over the world golfers talk the same
language much of it nonsense and
much unprintable”.


Conned
in the
Afternoon
Terrible scenes at funeral
By DAVID McNICOLL
Good God, you say, looking at the
street-corner poster. What rotten
luck for poor old Askin. What
can be the trouble? Coronary? He is a
fair bit overweight. Just when he’s doing
so well, too. Wonder if it was something
to do with the Bondi result . . .
So you put sixpence in the hand of
the newsboy and collect your “Daily
Mirror”. Nothing on page 1. Strange.
Flick. Ah, there it is, a short item at
the foot of page two.
It’s not Mr Askin at all. It’s Mr
David Brand, Premier of Western Aus-
tralia. It’s not Mascot airport, either;
it’s Essendon. It’s not even a serious
collapse just a suspected kidney ail-
ment. If it weren’t for the fact that you
wanted to read the Stock Exchange
quotes or Mac Divot, you would heave
the paper away in a rage at being
“conned” once more.
The fact that on Monday, November
8, the offender was the “Mirror”, should
not give the reader the idea that the
“Mirror” is the principal offender. The
next day “The Sun” poster read,
“Sammy Davis. Suicide Attempt”. A
search for this obvious hot bit of news
ended up in an extract from Sammy
Davis’ autobiography in which reference
was made to a far-off suicide bid made
by an actor who is today, as everybody
knows, high on the ladder of success.
It is no concern of mine how the after-
noon papers of Sydney are run. We at
Consolidated Press run a morning news-
paper without resort to misleading
posters; so does the “Sydney Morning
Herald”. But the concern many news-
papermen feel about the afternoon posters
is caused by the damage those posters
are doing to all papers including the
“Herald” and the “Telegraph”.
It is all part of an intense circulation
battle between Sydney’s afternoon
papers. And while the seconds stand in
the corners (Warwick Fairfax and Angus
McLachlan in one, Rupert Murdoch and
Douglas Brass in another) the editorial
chiefs of the two papers reel round the
ring using every crooked or suspect
trick in the book to gain an advantage
over their opponent. And while they
are doing it, the audience is slowly
becoming cynical and sickened, and the
ultimate casualties are not merely the
two papers concerned but the whole
image of journalism in Australia.
The “Sun” and the “Mirror” are
within a few thousand of each other
in circulation. In recent years the
“Mirror” has crept closer and closer
to the “Sun”. As it did so, the reaction
from the then managing director of John
Fairfax Ltd (Mr R. A. Henderson) was
immediate and sustained beat them
at their own game. The fact that the
“Sun ’ was one of the brood sheltering
under the prim maternal skirts of Granny
Herald did not seem to concern anyone
at Broadway. The child was clipped over
the ear, taught the elements of street-
brawling, given advanced lessons on
female anatomy and sex, handed a
knuckle-duster and a kit of oral con-
traceptives and sent out to make its
own way in the crude afternoon world
which the “Mirror” was starting to
dominate.
The battle has grown in intensity in
the past two years. In that time the
content and editorial slickness of both
papers has improved. They display a
technical excellence which cannot but
be admired. But the fight has caused
both papers to (a) lower standards of
decency and honesty, and (b) resort to
false pretences in posters.
The lowering of standards of decency
is particularly strange in the case of the
“Sun”. The public is pretty easily hood-
winked, but there must be thousands
of people who know the “Sydney Morn-
ing Herald” owns the “Sun”, and many
of these must have protested to the
"Herald” about instances of prurience
and unpleasant suggestiveness. An in-
stance of a “Sun” poster which com-
bined lip-licking suggestion with blatant
deceit read:
PICTURES
UNDRESSED
GIRLS
SPANKED
HEAD
FINED
The pictures, as purchasers of the
"Sun' found either to their disappoint-
ment or relief, were not of undressed
girls being spanked. They were of the!
headmaster alleged to have spanked the
girls and of one of the schoolmistresses,
It seems that the effect on public
opinion and the secondary harm donei
to newspapers generally is not causing
much concern to the “Sun” and “Mirror’j
senior executives. From their point of
view the position is difficult. They have
a tiger by the tail in their mad rush
for the screaming, sensational poster.
And they have no doubt decided that
if they adopted a unilateral policy of
more sober and genuine posters,
the circulation advantage would immedi-
ately go to the opposition.
Perhaps this would be so. But surely
in the long run the paper which com-
bined brightness with non-misleading,
posters would benefit. And if both papers!
decided to call a truce on infuriating
deceptions, the benefit would be felt
throughout the newspaper industry
generally.
It is the tendency to give a local look
to a far-off story which is the main
exasperation to the educated afternoon
paper reader. A recent poster which
referred to “Terrible Scenes at Funeral”
conjured up a riot at Rookwood or
something of the sort. It was in facta,
reference to a review of the Waugh film, I
“The Loved One” in New York the 1
night before. Could anything be more
misleading? Or more infuriating? Bull
this goes on all the time. Stories of TV
personalities are given a poster twist
to make them appear local when in factj
they may relate to some minor per-,
sonality in America or England. Film'
stars, as far as posters are concerned, j
are invariably “famous” even when
as in the case of Clara Bow the bulk
of readers have never seen them in films.!

In many instances, businesses never re-open after

destroyed, customers—no matter how loyal and
sympathetic—must go elsewhere, often to stay.
Business cannot afford fire—but business can

Then there are the instances where a
blanket word is used. For instance, the
“Mirror” on July 9 declared “US Chief
Quits”. President Johnson is the obvious
one to jump to mind, even though the
thought of a President quitting is odd.
But no, it was General Maxwell Taylor
in Vietnam. On July 22, there was
“£500,000 Opera Shock”. Was this
another Opera House scandal? It was
not. It was the financial risks of the
Sutherland season caused by fluctuating
attendances (I see the season finished
only £24,000 in the red.)
July was quite a vintage month at
the “Sun”. “Poker Machine Shock”
turned out to be an allegation that a
rumor that poker machines in hotels
might be legalised had shocked the
Askin Government. On July 24, the
“Sun” trumpeted, “Nudists Attack
Police”. Visions of Superintendent
Walden running from Coogee pursued
by naked bathers? No. It was a story
from St Tropez, France, where som*
nude sunbakers had defied four sen
darmes.
The “Mirror” in August hit some bright
notes. “Sydney Beach Radio Active”
turned out to be a claim by a Sydney
schoolboy which reference to scientists
would have exploded before it went in
the pages of a newspaper. “Dance Hall
Outrage! Attack on Girl” proved to be
an incident in England, not Sydney,
Similarly “100 Buried Alive in Rock
Slide” was in America.
In September the “Sun” warmed up,
“Famous Actor on Bail” turned out to
be George Raft charged with a minor
tax - infringement in California. “TV
Producer Suicide” which gave most
people the impression that it would
relate to the unfortunate death of
Michael Plant, in fact referred to the
death of Charles Boyer’s son. Prurience
held its own with “Religious Murder.
Undies Slashed”. A raid on some Italian
homes produced, “Arms Found. Mafia
Raid”. “Aussies in Chains”, with all the
horror it conjured, melted into prisoners
in Brisbane being handcuffed while being
transferred from cells to court. A price-
cutting war which resulted in a certain
brand of cigarettes being offered at a
lower rate was announced in the poster
“Smokes Down Bd. a Packet”.
The “Mirror” in the same month
pinned the Mafia tag on to local Italians
again with the poster, “Mafia in Sydney”.
“TV Star. Adultery Charge” was not
about any local heroes of the little
screen, but was about Dinah Shore. So
it goes on, the daily guessing game. If
you only read the posters and never the
papers, some of the strange allegations
would fit like neat jigsaw puzzles. For
instance, the "Sun” on October 19:
“Sammy Davis Junior, Blinded” (his eye
suffered a minor injury on stage and
he missed no performances) would have
its natural sequence in the more recent
“Sammy Davis Suicide Attempt”. The
running posters about the arrest of
Johnny O'Keefe (who then entered a
hospital for treatment) culminated on
the day of his much-publicised court
hearing with., the poster, “O’Keefe. Spat
on Police”. But, no, it was not an inci-
dent in court that day, it was evidence
of O'Keefe’s behavior on the night of
his arrest weeks before behavior
which resulted in his going to hospital.
To criticise other papers is easy, but
criticism of the afternoon paper posters
can be supported by arguments which
should, in all conscience, be only too
apparent to the proprietors of the
“Mirror” and the “Sun”. And those
arguments add up to a simple conclu-
sion that the scramble for circulation
in Sydney's evening field is resulting in
a general denigration of the Press and a
downgrading in its prestige.


AROUND MELBOURNE
Batman Crosses the Murray
Cultural exchanges for Melbourne and Sydney
tpHE unfortunate state of relations
A between Sydney and Melbourne is
entirely due to lack of communication
and understanding between the two
States. Before it is too late we should
organise some Churchill scholarships
with cultural exchanges at all levels.
We could exchange students, doctors,
scientists, clerics and such for 12-
monthly periods. We could swap Pro-
fessor Jock Marshall for Professor
Harry Messel, Percy Cerutty for
Forbes Carlile, Sir Irving Benson for
the Rev. Alan Walker, even Eric
Baume for Norman Banks. The whole
scheme could reach a beautiful climax
with Moomba being staged in Sydney
and the Waratah Festival in Mel-
bourne.
The fact is that your correspondent,
for the first time in many years, has
just taken a quick look at Sydney. It
was interesting to discover that
Sydney is not nearly as bad as we had
been led to believe. Even the weather
was comfortably pleasant, no fetid
heat, but a pleasant, 40 degree south-
erly with gentle rain Indeed, the visit
was a disturbing experience, because
one couldn’t help but get the feeling
that Sydney was gaining an edge on
Melbourne. Of course, much of the
activity is an illusion. It’s the narrow
streets: they provide an appalling sort
of venturi effect with traffic, but even
so one feels instinctively that more
is happening in Sydney. That first
look of Sydney, as one approaches the
Harbor Bridge, is now something
which makes one almost stand up in
the taxi. It is superior to the famous
chocolate-box view of Melbourne
from the Yarra Bank at Anderson
Street Bridge.
Both Sydney’s old and new build-
ings are superior to Melbourne’s. For
the first time I had a look at the
restored clock and tower on the GPO.
There are insufficient words to
describe how marvellous this is. It
could have come direct from some
mountain village in the Tyrol. It’s
perfect. Then there’s the lovely old
brownstone Bank of New South Wales
building in Pitt Street. Over the door
are two massive Grecian females
(54-34-54) obviously to give the idea
“this is the sort of strength you have
to protect your accounts”. But they
are practical people, these bankers.
There is pigeon wire over the balus-
trades to stop the birds from releasing
droppings upon treasured borrowers.
In the Brighton - Palace - Moslem -
Mosque School of Architecture Syd-
ney’s Victoria Building also is right in
front of Flinders Street Railway
Station. Its domes are better than
Melbourne’s domes. Over the main
entrance there is another gargantuan
but charming sculptured group, a lady
with two gentlemen. The gentlemen
appear to be wearing nothing but
laurel wreaths around their heads.
Down below is the business of
Fletcher Jones and staff with a large
electric sign: “Nothing but Trousers”.
We have never been able to manage
symbolism as pretty as that at Flin-
ders Street Station.
As for the new buildings the IBM,
the AMP, the Qantas are all quite
beautiful. One could say that the
Reserve Bank looks most comfortable
in its new establishment and the lofty
£4.400.000 water building is particu-
larly fine. One has to hand it to
Sydney. Only a city with no water
and a lack of sewerage would have the
magnificent defiance to put up a build-
ing like that.
Opera House? Well, I was try-
ing to delay that. There’s such pas-
sion for it in Sydney one has to be
brave to say anything. From a mile or
so off, say way under the bridge, it
looked glorious, but when suddenly
one is confronted with it from the
viewing platform, it seems all too
much like - a wild dream. A friend
said to me: “It looks like Joan
Sutherland with her mouth open.'’
The Australia Square project,
though, looks quite the most promis-
ing thing that is happening in Aus-
tralia. The smaller £1 million build-
ing already completed is not over-
impressive. It merely shows flashes
of Flemington Housing Commission.
The 46-storey tower, now rising up
to the third floor will, I fear, be the
most exciting building in Australia.
There’s the beautiful symmetry of the
outside supporting columns, the
geometry of the concrete pattern
under the ceilings, which one can see
already, and Harry Seidler has
promised some magnificent sculpture
for the open spaces outside. Let’s hope
he doesn't frighten the natives. Both
Sydney and Melbourne have barely
been introduced to public sculpture
since Victoria’s day.
The State Offices, now 42 storeys
high, almost went unnoticed. It’s
almost as if the NSW Government is
terribly ashamed of having spent so
much money. It’s a dull grey-black
tower which looks as if it has been
ring-barked and then swept by fire.
More symbolism, perhaps.
But I like Sydney. Like all Mel-
burnians I get a marvellous sense of
sin when I go there. Melbourne is
said to be the land of wealth, but it
is always surprising how taxis are
easier to find in Sydney, how larger
and longer freeways manage to be
built, how universities are constructed
with less effort, and how public trans-
port manages to be cheaper. The girls,
alas, didn't seem quite as pretty as 1
remembered, too burnt-up by the sun.
Fashions, too, were dull, untidy, and
far behind Melbourne You must
remember that we have had the
Shrimp in Melbourne and now all
the little chicks are wearing their
skirts four inches above the knee.
Then the standard of dress for the
men is quite wretched shapeless
suits, open-necked shirts and many
of the men show a regrettable ten-
dency to come to town in shorts and
long socks, an uncomfortable garb at
any time. If they really want to be
cool and look good, how much better
to wear a lap-lap.
But as a true Melburnian just one
thing brought a nostalgic tear to mv
eye. It was not far from Central
Station, just one stretch of it, maybe
50 yards long, swamped at either end
by bitumen. Dear reader, it was
Sydney’s last little bit of tramline.
BATMAN


THE INTELLIGENT WOMAN'S GUIDE
Blues for Mr Amies
Amies, the Queen’s dress-
maker, wears his hair convention-
ally short, but he likes long hair
on young men properly cut, of
course, and just tipping the lobes of
the ears.
“Mind you, it’s essential for the young
man with long hair to have a young girl
on his arm,” he says. “Long hair is
an arrogant fashion. It says, I’m young
(and I have a lot of hair). It does fit
in with the long, lean lines of today’s
clothes, but men over the ages have
worn their hair long more often than
they have worn it short.”
Mr Amies is in Australia for two-and-
a-half weeks, talking about fashion gen-
erally and promoting men’s fashion par-
ticularly. (The aggregate annual turnover
of the menswear firms he designs for
is £l6 million.)
He started designing clothes for men
only after he had made his name in
women's high fashion and he admits
that it is young men who started hoist-
ing men’s fashion out of the doldrums.
“The teddy boys started it,” he said.
“A man's dress is a sort of visiting
card, and a respectable banker used to
be the image that a man wanted to
project the banker’s clothes were the
mark of a solid citizen who could
afford to support a family. But today
very young people earn enough to sup-
port a family.”
Mr Amies himself cuts an elegant
figure. To say that he has the blues
would be misleading. He is cheerfully—
and with wit and style working his
way through a crowded eight weeks
round the world.
But, nevertheless, he does have the
blues. He is never seen wearing any
other color. It all started five or six years
ago when he had the usual array of
colors in his wardrobe, with the result
that he’d often find himself in another
country glumly surveying a suitcase of
clothes that seemed to be more mix than
match.
The one-color look solves that prob-
lem although, of course you have
to be careful. “Not everything a man
wears should match,” he said. “It looks
too contrived. Women shouldn’t wear
all one color either but they can
get away with it more than men.”
Mr Amies was wearing a brown
spotted gold silk handkerchief in his
breast pocket. But what color would his
hat be. He obligingly opened a cupboard
and produced a high-crowned, narrow-
brimmed “forward looker”. It was navy,
too.
Mr Amies’ “navy” is not that lifeless
color associated with school tunics; it’s
more a royal than a navy which is
as it should be for the Court dress-
maker.
He pulled his hat forward until it was
almost resting on the bridge on his nose
and surveyed the whole man in the
mirror. “I’m 55,” he said, “and this
is the way I think I should look.” Like
many Englishmen of the same genera-
tion Mr Amies just does not look as
old as he is.
It is the total look with just that
dash of contrast that he is promoting.
How does he see the total look for a
couple the well-matched pair?
“In Sydney in summer I would like
to see the girl with hair shoulder-length
and marvellously brushed. She would
be wearing a navy-blue thick linen dress,
sleeveless a marvellously balanced
shift, designed so that the outline
remains the same even when she moves.
Then she would have navy-blue, very
transparent stockings, navy-blue shoes,
short white cotton gloves and a cool,
white, basketwork handbag.
“The man should have a thin, blue
mohair or worsted suit, with narrow
pants and a slightly wider jacket, black
shoes (slip-ons not lace-ups), pale blue
shirt and a blue knitted tie. It sounds
like me, doesn't it?
“He would wear a white panama
hat turned up at the back, down at the
front, and tilted forward, just to the
nose. His hair would be long, just cover-
ing his ears. Long hair seems a better
background for a hat.
“The girl’s hat? Perhaps a lovely, big,
white straw. But I don’t want to be too
categorical about this. Sydney is so much
the seaside town as well as being a big
city that hats are not important as they
are elsewhere. I feel sorry for the millin-
ery. trade.”
Mr Amies is delighted with the shift.
He sees it as the fashion for the future
as well as the present partly because
it is still not done properly. “I don’t
think it is right in a light fabric. It needs
body to give it outline. It is the same
principle as a coat and it needs balance.
We have to realise that it’s a tailoring
problem.”
He himself designs dresses that just
cover the knee when the wearer stands
still. “But all clothes are meant to be seen
in motion.” (After all, it’s a go-go world.)
He likes long skirts for informal
evenings, but he thinks the mods who
wore long skirts during the day were
ridiculous. “Let’s keep the rules until
we change them,” he said. “Life is
complicated enough keeping up with the
evolution of fashion. Let’s not start
revolutions.”
In keeping up with the evolution of
fashion he is prepared to go along with
shorter skirts even though he sticks
by his opinion of a few years ago that
women's knees are like “uncooked rock
buns”.
Mr Amies likes to get away from the
fashion world. When he leaves Australia
next week he will have 12 days in
Bangkok and Cambodia, steering clear
of Thai silks, and he’s redecorating a
house in London in as understated a
way as possible using a few of the fabrics
that he could come across in his work.
“There’s a lot of leather, and abstract
geometric patterns, nothing floral, natural
linens, and off-white tufted carpets.
There are 12 rooms in the house and
the walls of all of them will be covered
in an off-white canvas weave vinyl. I
wanted to get away from the idea that
each room has been carefully designed
for itself and not for the house as a
whole.”
He drives a 6L-litre 8-cylinder navy-
blue Jensen that can touch 160 m.p.h.—
he’s taken it up to 120 in the country,
and has a navy-blue Mini for driving
around the city. He adores opera, (and
insists on studying a work before seeing
it performed), plays lawn tennis winter
and summer, likes entertaining (usually
a dinner party for eight at least once
a week) and ice skating.
He combined the last two “likes” a
few years ago in what must have been
the last word in ice parties.
“It was one of the best parties you
could imagine. It took me six months to
prepare. There were 1200 guests. I hired
an ice rink and had a dance floor in
the same room. There were professional
skating instructors. I had some waiters
on skates and some not. People were
invited to wear skating dress or evening
dress if they didn’t want to skate. But
we ended up with people in evening
dress skating. I’ve never done another
party like that.”
Mr Amies is as forward-tilted as his
hat. He doesn’t repeat a last word.

ON THE MARGIN
The Dark Side of the Tasman
When I read some time ago that Mandy
Rice-Davies had been refused per-
mission to enter New Zealand, I felt a
sense of relief. It seemed to me that if
Miss Rice-Davies went to the Dominion
she would be exposed to moral danger.
She is a girl who, after a somewhat un-
steady start, is striving to make a decent,
honest career as a nightclub entertainer.
The worst possible environment for her
would be a country like New Zealand,
which is notorious for its violent crimes,
juvenile delinquency, and bizarre sex
practices.
I admit I have never been to New Zea-
land. I spent a day once at the docks in
Wellington, carrying sides of beef on to
a troopship on which I was a passenger;
there was a dock strike at the time. But
during this brief visit I was not permitted
to enter the city. I could only gaze curi-
ously from the ship’s rail at
Wellington’s network of streets,
which I pictured as a Casbah
seething with exotic vices.
My knowledge of New Zea-
land has been acquired entirely
from the safety of Sydney, by
reading the newspaper items
which emanate from the Domi-
nion. The episode that first
stirred my interest in trans-
Tasman depravity was the
Piha Bones Case. I do not
remember the details, except
that they were human bones. Later
there was a celebrated murder
more characteristic of New Zea-
land because more strange and per-
verse committed by two girls in a con-
dition called folie a deux.
With the passing of time I became mor-
bidly fascinated by the evil doings in
the land of the kiwi. I began to form a
collection of newspaper clippings, which
today provides shocking reading. Some-
times I take it out and browse over the
items when I am bored by the novels
of lan Fleming and James Hadley Chase.
Here is a group of headlines culled
from the cable news from New Zealand
during a quiet week: Dunedin: Jockey
Thrashed With Hosepipe. Auckland:
Opium Hidden Under Armpits. Welling-
ton: Loved by 43, Girl Claims.
It is hard to say offhand which depart-
ment of wickedness New Zealanders
find most congenial. They certainly excel
at causing grievous bodily harm. My
files are crowded with items such as Hot
Poker Assault, Footballers Bashed, Mob
Attacks Police, Hockey Girl Slashed by
Boy-Friend.
The use of narcotics appears to be a
national pastime. As evidence I have
Claim of Drugs in Porridge; Drug Addic-
tion Rife in NZ; Doped Coffee Death;
and Marihuana Danger. But all things
considered, I think the Dominion shows
most enthusiasm for offences related to
sex. A common type o? headline is:
Laws Fail to Curb NZ Orgies. Leafing
through my cuttings I notice: Strip Act
Traps Peeping Milko; Wellington Sex
Monster Gets Six Years; Man Used Ju-
jitsu in Perversion; Naked Girl's Insult
to Police; and Kidnapper Says Girl Was
For Sale.
Even by present world standards the
juvenile delinquents of New Zealand
easily hold their own. Typical reports of
their activities read: Two Die in Teen
Orgies; NZ Teenage Alcoholics; Christ-
church Schoolgirls Worked as Sex Team.
In view of the moral standards pre-
vailing in the nation, its Rugby
football team, the All Blacks,
seems singularly well named.
But I confess I do not under-
stand how New Zealanders, in
their debauched condition, are
able to play football so vigo-
rously. One must assume that
when in training they are under
strict orders to cut dowm on
drugs and not stay out too late
at orgies.
Another puzzling aspect of
the situation is the character
of the New Zealanders one meets in Aus-
tralia. As a rule they are intelligent, well-
behaved persons. Presumably they are
refugees, who have fled from their de-
cadent homeland to start a new life in
the wholesome atmosphere of, say,
King’s Cross.
They are oddly loyal to their country
of origin. I asked a gifted woman writer,
who grew up in New Zealand, if she had
been worried by sex crimes of the type
recorded in my Press cuttings. She
replied: “None of the girls I knew was
ever given drugged porridge, or troubled
by a peeping milko.” A likely story.
Some time I intend to cross the Tasman
and find out for myself what goes on in
that modern Sodom and Gomorrah. It is
a risky venture for a clean-living Aus-
tralian, but I shall go equipped for New
Zealand conditions, with opium hidden
under my armpits and carrying a length
of hosepipe. By the way, I just clipped
another cable, from Tokyo this time:
“NZ Stripper Seized in Drug Swoop”.
They are trying to corrupt the Japanese
now.

The Grass-roots Liberal
Kevin Cairns: The backbencher behind Dr K
By BRIAN JOHNS
He is not a man quickly noticed any-
where much less in the grand-
standing atmosphere of Federal
Parliament. He is a clerk-like figure,
shortish, plain and earnest. But the
Liberal member for the Queensland seat
of Lilley is intrinsically one of the most
interesting of backbenchers.
Kevin Michael Kiernan Cairns from
his place on the backbench poses the real
possibility that the Liberal Party, with-
out Sir Robert Menzies, without the
Democratic Labor Party, without the
Communist bogy, even without the
Country Party, could well be reaching
the point where it will become the
genuine majority
party in Australia.
Cairns shows the
distance the Liberal
Party has gone in
reaching the group
which once would
have been regarded
as “traditional
Labor”. Now 35,
Cairns is the son of
an Irish immigrant,
a militant Labor
Party man, an of-
ficial of a minor
waterfront union,
and who was for
many years a mem-
ber of the Trades
and Labor Council
in Sydney. Cairns is
one of only two
children and he re-
members that it was
at his sister’s insistence that financial
sacrifices were made so that he could go
to Sydney. Catholic GPS St Joseph’s for
his final schooling.
He won a University Exhibition and
studied dentistry at Sydney University.
He did follow his father’s footsteps in
one regard —he joined the local ALP
branch in the lower-middle class suburb
of Belmore. “I can’t remember any pre-
cise issue now, but I just wandered away
from the Labor Party in 1948 or 1949.
I had attended only a few meetings.”
While he was an undergraduate at
Sydney Cairns became involved in the
Movement, which apparently believed it
was a big political deal to try to control
the Students’ Representative Council,
“Honi Soit” and so on. From his vague
recollections of these days, Cairns may
well have been on the periphery of the
Movement scene, which probably was
most effective in stirring bitter wrangling
in the Newman Society, rather than
KEVIN CAIRNS
effectively “influencing” other University
groups.
For Cairns the serious business of
politics began when he joined the Liberal
Party in Queensland in the ’fifties after
having gone to Brisbane to establish his
own dental practice. He had worked in
Melbourne and at the Broken Hill Mines
dental clinic, where he met and later
married his wife. (“She is the eldest of
10 children and comes from a well-known
mining family; Paddy O’Neill was at our
wedding.”)
He went into the Liberal Party via the
Queensland Young Liberals, mainly
owing to the influence of Mr William
Knox, now the State
member for Nundah
with whom he was
sharing a flat at the
time. Cairns is a far
distance from the
image of the Young
Liberal as the party-
going social fizz-gig.
Tackled with this
proposition of the
Y o ung Liberals,
Cairns begins to un-
ravel the tough
main-thread of his
Libe rali s m. The
Young Liberals
in Queensland at
least are not like
this at all, Cairns
will tell you. They
are concerned to
build a broadly
based, activist party.
They will do things. They are politically
involved. “Many of them are active trade
unionists. A couple of months ago there
was an anti-Vietnam demonstration. The
Young Liberals organised their own
counter-demonstration and swamped the
others. Our Queensland Liberal Party
branch has the greatest grass - roots
spread,” Cairns adds with only apparent
irrelevance.
It is terribly important to Cairns that
the Liberal Party cast off its vestiges of
a privileged class party. He reacts very
strongly to the idea that social reform is
the prerogative of the Labor Party. This
no doubt is one reason why he has con-
centrated on economic matters since
entering Parliament in 1963. (He re-
cently took examinations for the final
units of an economics degree from the
University of Queensland.) He is gradu-
ally building a reputation as a thoughtful
and diligent debater on economic issues,
and more than once has presented the
Treasurer, Mr Holt, with tough questions.
However, there are those who would say
that as yet he is too theoretical, text-
bookish in his approach.
That may be. But in his analytical way,
Cairns is a fierce if the word was not
loaded, one would say pious—enthusiast.
It is obviously a matter of integrity for
him that the Liberal Party should be
thrust across all social strata, but most
particularly the working class. It might
be expected that he himself does not
always appear to be at ease with his
fellow-Liberals.
Significantly, in talking of his politics
Cairns will dart in references to the Ken-
nedy family. “With all their money Rose
Kennedy never allowed her children to
lose contact with their grass roots. People
who have had it easy can so easily miss
out on a social awareness, social prin-
ciples, the need for a redistribution of
wealth, A sensitivity to these things pre-
vents you from being cast backward as
a reactionary.”
After the Leader of the Opposition,
Mr Calwell, had raised the problem of
poverty in Australia in the last session,
Cairns contributed what he described “as
one or two gentle thoughts”. Characteris-
tically, this did not stop him including a
quote from the journal, “New Econo-
mics”: “His (Mr Calwell’s) latest state-
ment that a war-on-poverty may be a


perfection

means whereby Labor can regain power
in Parliament leaves us cold. Who is in
power in Parliament is of secondary im-
portance compared with the abolition of
poverty.”
For his own part Cairns said: “We
have all heard it said often that we live
in an affluent society. We have heard it
said often enough that this affluent
society has enabled people to uplift them-
selves and express their personality. But
if we live in this kind of society we also
have a duty to ask ourselves how far does
the affluence spread.” He then went on
a three-prong programme which would
allow an effective national survey on
poverty to be made.
First, all data gathered by the Com-
monwealth and State Government relief
authorities should be collated along
with establishing a uniform method of
assistance —so that a proper comparison
of conditions could be made. Then there
. was a need for a national household
expenditure survey along lines similar to
those conducted annually by the British
Ministry of Agriculture. He quoted one
of these reports which showed that the
average British household of a man
woman and four or more children had a
diet with an energy value falling below
100 per cent of the requirement. “The
remarkable thing is that this was found
in all social classes amongst those who
were well off as well as amongst those
who were not well off. One would suspect
that this kind of situation could occur in
Australia.” As a third step he called for a
minimum nutritional survey to be con-
ducted by the Nutritional Committee of
the National Health and Medical Re-
search Council in the various State capi-
tals. Altogether, these ideas were not the
stuff of a passionate speech, but it was
typical of the approach of Kevin Cairns.
Like all Liberal members he makes
use of Communist and anti-Communist
issues. Although Labor members refuse
to acknowdedge the fact, Cairns and other
Liberals in the Parliamentary Party, des-
pite lapses of crude red-baiting, now see
defence and foreign affairs as ideological
issues which differentiate the Liberal
Party and are vital cushioning factors in
the “me-tooism” of Australian politics.
Nevertheless, for the most part Cairns is
restrained in his handling of Communist
issues. This restraint is seen at its best
in his speeches in defence of Dr Knopfel-
macher.
Certainly, he follows the hard-line
that the Knopfelmacher affair is an
issue of political victimisation of the
Melbourne University academic by the
Left, but he is careful to couch his
case moderately, even while making
analogies with McCarthyist pressures on
US universities, and Hitler’s inroads on
German universities. He stresses that the
Knopfelmacher case confronts Austra-
lian universities themselves with a prob-
lem of academic integrity, which is
particularly dangerous because it raises
the unpalatable possibility of Govern-
ment intrusion on academic freedom.
Cairns is one of those Catholics who
has taken the knowledge of his religion
to tertiary level. (For one thing he
majored in scholastic philosophy at the
University of Queensland but at
the same time studied Russian for
the Arts degree he received just before
entering Parliament in 1963.) However,
he could not be tabbed as “a Liberal
Catholic” by the rough reckoners of
attitudes to Catholic education, the Pill,
and the rest, on which his views are
firmly traditional, Indeed, he bears the
old-fashioned marks of the Dr Rumble
style of apologetic Catholicism. His
religion cannot have made his road any
easier in the Liberal Party.
Nevertheless, he is very much a
Catholic in the Party. He played an
important role in swinging Queensland
Liberals behind State Aid by preparing a
series of papers on the issue. These papers
were the results of his study of the prob-
lem in Queensland, and a survey of the
political elements in the issue in all States,


Something you 're going to enjoy is now happening on Air New Zealand
Air New Zealand’s inauguration of new long-range DC-8 services involves much more than
just adding new jetliners to its fleet. It introduces a new concept in passenger service—styled

First, the people.
On Air New Zealand Five Star Jetline services you
are looked after by one of the most highly trained
passenger service teams in the.world. It isn’t easy
to get a job with Air New Zealand. And it’s harder
still to pass the training tests. Only the dedicated
qualify. You’ll find them quietly thoughtful and effi-
cient people.
Serving food and drinks to 130 people on short
flights short because Air New Zealand’s DC-8s
are so very fast — isn’t necessarily difficult. But Air
New Zealand are being very particular about the
kind of meals and drinks that are served. They
believe that whether you’re business or pleasure-
travelling you would prefer to enjoy yourself. So
Five Star Jetline service involves meals and drinks
which would be outstanding in a first class restaurant
anywhere. To achieve this in the sky, the new DC-8s
have not one kitchen-bar, but two kitchens and a
separate bar.

only in South Australia.) He is extremely
close to the State president of the Queens-
land Liberal Party, Senator Sherrington,
and has been since becoming a member
of the seven-member Party policy com-
mittee in 1959. Cairns has a marked
taste for research. After the 1961 elec-
tions, which were so disastrous for the
Goverqment in Queensland, he prepared
a confidential statistical survey of the
voting patterns. He claimed this showed
that the Government had lost the elec-
tion in Queensland by DLP votes and
preferences going to the Labor Party.
This showed, he claimed, that it was not
the impact of the economic recession
which defeated the Government, so much
as the fact that in the 1961 campaign
It have often been accused of being
[I interested only in fine table wines.
Even if this is true, it’s quite a fine
thing to be accused of. To back up his
claim, my newest inquisitor states that
I have only discussed one sherry in the
four years of this column. This may
well be correct, but at least that discus-
sion finished up on the back of the
bottle. My two-pronged pal goes on to
say, “What is the best sherry?”.
How on earth can you answer such
a thing. I don’t even know what sherry
/ like best, let alone what other people
should like. But what I do look for is a
delicate fino, showing good balance
between flor and oak, that is consistent
in quality. Consistency is most import-
ant. Of these Quelltaler Granfiesta,
Yalumba Chiquata, Hardy’s Flor Fino,
Seabrook's Special Pale and Seppelt's
Pale Dry Solero, come readily to mind.
There may well be others. But the above
are all very good value for money. A
lot of people don’t realise quite how
much.
I was upset the other day when a
(leading pusher of the most local pro-
ducts said . . . “It’s a shame about the

enough at the Labor Party being led
by Calwell for the first time —on the
ideological grounds of defence and

Liberals hit these issues hard in the
following 18 months, distributing tens of
thousands of propaganda pamphlets.
Cairns’ own electorate of Lilley
is the most Catholic in Queensland
with almost 30 per cent as against a
fraction more than 24 per cent elsewhere.
But he had to do battle with 13 or 14
other candidates to win Liberal pre-selec-
tion for the seat. Should he lose it, it is
a safe bet that he would occupy an
important place in the Liberal Party
machine where he would continue to
strive for a “grass roots” Party.

again the question of value comes into

Then in the 1940 s an Englishman

all out. He even made wine in detention.
During times of Red Cross plenty he

this didn’t diminish his fondness for

Where to look
for the important savings
in welding costs ...
Tlie metal fabricating industry succeeds by
giving customers the best value for money.
This means keeping many high costs under
control.
It means utilizing to best advantage Aus-
tralia’s low-priced steel.
It means ensuring the use of modern weld-
ing plant and equipment.
But whether your final product is a sky-
scraper or a clothes-line, your highest cost
is the skilled labour which cuts, assembles
and welds.
It is also the cost which can most often be
reduced by improved methods.
Lincoln Electric is Australia’s largest manu-
facturer of arc welding equipment. But
knowing what there is to know about weld-
ing is only part of our business. Helping
our customers to apply this knowledge to
achieve the improved methods is the other;
the vital part of special interest to you.
If you think increasing productivity might
be one way of keeping your costs under
control, the man from Lincoln would like
to help.
It is a valuable service you should expect
from your welding equipment supplier.

Inevitably, on tasting the wines for
the first time, one compares them with
“real” wines, that is, products of the
grape. Indeed, tasting them masked, j
decided that one wine would make
excellent blending material for white
wine and it turned out to be made from
white currants. But this doesn’t take
away from the other fruit wines, for
if the wine mind can be freed com.
pletely from prejudice, they ate
remarkably good. The cider is first
class, clean, refreshing and very well
balanced, lacking only in that delicious
cider apple tang that I remember so well,
My favorites in the drier range were
bilberry and gooseberry. The first is
quite remarkable, a pale red color,
vinous and astringent with a pleasant
nose and clean, rather flinty, palate. The,
gooseberry is like an overgrown whitel
burgundy, definitely fruity and full ofl
flavor. Of the sweeter varieties the red
currant and orange caught the attention,!
both being very true to the fruit, but
with a delicacy and balance that wasl
frankly surprising. In fact, the most!
remarkable thing about the whole range
is that they have no coarseness on
excessive cordial quality. If this isi
patronising, let it remain so, for I cer-l
tainly expected the wines to be a lot
of lolly water. They aren’t, and they’re
worthy of inspection.
I met Ian Howie a couple of years
ago when he was here and he is a I
most likeable fellow with very much thei
traditional friendliness and fun that!
characterises many wine men. And when/
nobody is watching, he sometimes drinks
wine made from grapes! |

LETTERS
Dutton as Dalai Lama
SIR. —I hope Mr Geoffrey Dutton’s
article, “A Republican Australia” (8.,
Nov. 20), is not a fair indication of what
we can expect from the symposium
which he is editing. He writes: “In the
recent hostilities between India and
Pakistan there was the surrealist fantasy
of a head (of the Commonwealth) at
war with itself.” I’m sure Mr Dutton
did not get this fascinating piece of legal
reasoning from Professor Cowen. It
would be true if and only if the Queen
were Head of State of India and
Pakistan. She is not. Which is one of
the reasons why those two countries are
called “Republics”.
Mr Donald Horne is quoted as saying
that “under our present system we could
never have a John Kennedy in Aus-
tralia”. If Mr Horne means that, because
our present system is not a Presidential
one, a John Kennedy could not become
President of Australia, then what he
says is very, very true and I would not
dream of doubting it for one moment.
By the same token, neither can we have
a Dwight Eisenhower, a Charles de
Gaulle, a Sekou Toure, a Kwame
Nkrumah or a Bung Karno. Similarly,
since our present system is not Buddhist
theocracy, we cannot have a Dalai
Lama. If Mr Horne means that our
present constitutional system would pre-
vent an Australian John Kennedy from
becoming Head of the Government, then
this is simply false.
But perhaps the most bewitching
feature of the article is the solemnity
with which Mr Dutton quotes the state-
ment of one of the editors of “Oz”:
“When you get down to your writing-
table you suddenly realise that the
greatest indictment against monarchy is
that it is so uninspiring to the writer.”
Monarchy fails to inspire the editor
of “Oz”!—A damning indictment indeed,
and as clear a proof as anyone could
demand that what Australia needs is
either a Donald Horne as President or
a Geoffrey Dutton as Dalai Lama.

Solicitors’ Trust Funds
SIR. In his somewhat flippant, cynical
and sarcastic letter (8., Nov. 13) on the
question of the proposed interest pay-
ments on trust funds to increase the
fidelity funds, “Solicitor” suggests “that
no one has yet come up with a proposal
lor compulsory audits”. He asserts this
“would automatically lower the size of
future claims” and benefit the majority
of the profession.
As a lifelong practitioner 1 say most
emphatically that a compulsory au lit
would be futile and useless. The dis-
honest solicitor would not pay certain
moneys to his trust account, or would
resort to some other method or device
to deceive the auditors. The cost would
also be prohibitive on account of che
necessary checking of files and records,
and would impose a most unfair burden
on the great reputable majority of the
State’s solicitors (estimated at 2800). The
idea of a compulsory audit is not some-
thing new or novel. An Act to this effect
was introduced in the NSW Parliament
by the then State Government about
1531, and after the first reading was
turned down in favor of the present
system of a guarantee or fidelity fund
by solicitors plus provision for a surprise
audit at any tune (following the New
Zealand system)
At present neither solicitors nor their
clients benefit from the daily balances in
solicitors’ trust funds (estimated at about
£10,000,000) only the banks do so.
The Law Society’s proposals are shortly
that the banks should pay interest on
one-third of each solicitor’s lowest yearly
trust account balance to (a) build up the
fidelity fund to £500,000, and (b) pro-
vide another fund of £500,000 for a legal
library, research, education, etc. 1 am
wholly in favor of (a) as only clients
would mainly benefit and receive full
protection; 1 am wholly opposed to (bfr
which should be provided by the pro-
fession itself by way of some moderate
increase in fees to the Law Society.
The occasional defaulting solicitor
receives maximum publicity, adversely
affecting the great majority of reputable
ones. Clients, themselves, have a
sponsibility and should report to the Law
Society any undue delay by their solicitor
in accounting for moneys. Solicitors
generally in their business dealings with
others also have a responsibility in keep-
ing a look out for a possible defaulting
member showing signs of deviation.
Rules as tc suitability and admission of
solicitors should be further strengthened.

SHODDY JUDGES
ffiJ^ulCetCn
80 Years Ago: November 28, 1885
JAMES MARTIN, Chiei Justice of
New South Wales, recently said:—
"In these ver; Democratic times there is
an unreasonable jealousy manifested by
Democratic legislators against judges."
The allegation is incorrect. The Democ-
racy has no objection to a judge merely
because he is a judge; but it altogether
objects to the shoddy 'retensions and
greed of power manifested by too many
of the persons to whose level the Bench
has been degraded. The Democracy is
proud of the abilities of a man like Sir
James Martin, but it has no reverence for
the cheeky pettifoggers who, after count-
less years of besmirchment in the slime of
political trickery, succeed in juggling them-
selves on to seats for which they were
never intended by Heaven, and straight
waj posing as uncanonised saints and
wingless angels The Democracy utterly
distrusts all lawyers, and it distrusts all
Courts as places where an ounce of
justice costs a ton of gold. But the Democ-
racy is patient, and it won't interfere with
the judges so long as they mind thei T own
business and keep civil.
Donald Horne’s “Permit”
SIR. —As the publisher of Donald
Horne’s “The Permit”, I would like to
thank Professor Leonie Kramer for a
review which caught the sheer funniness
and entertainment of the book (8., Nov.
13).
But I must defend both Sun Books
and Donald Horne against her charge
that “His publishers have not done Mr
Horne a service by labelling his book
satirical. Ii is a broad slapstick comedy,
crazy farce played fast and loud”. Slap-
stick and farce are hilarious travesties
of reality. To hop into bed with the
wrong wife, to see the villain sail bottom-
wards on a banana skin, to clown under
disguises, these are all glorious possi-
bilities, maybe, but not designed to anger
or change the real world, which is the
aim of satire.
But it is legitimate to use all weapons
for a satirical end. Donald Horne uses
caricature, slapstick and high-speed in-
congruities to show the absurdities and
hypocrisies of real life Knowledgeable
readers of “The Permit” all agree that
policies, journalism and the law can be
just like this. And if serious institutions
are shown to be absurd in their effect
on an innocent person, then there is
more than just a laugh involved. No one
confuses bedroom farce with a satirical
attack on the sanctity of marriage. But
Adam Richmond, the non-hero of “The
Permit”, is an innocent-like Gulliver or
Candide. The non-classifving reader
will draw further conclusions, which he
will not do from slapstick or farce.

8., Nov. 6.) When asked in the course
of a private conversation what I thought
of the “Reynolds’ rumpus” in the House
the previous week, I said I was not in
the House at the time. After reading
Hansard and The Bulletin’s report I
said (again in private conversation) that
had I been present, I for one would
have had to support Mr. Reynolds, j
felt his complaints were in the main
justified, but partly out of date.
When in Vietnam and Thailand I had
discussions on similar matters, but under,
stood most of them had been attended
to since my return in mid-August. How-
ever, it was not Mr Reynolds’ speech but
the subsequent debate that caused the
crossfire. The real row in the House
occurred the day after Mr Reynolds
spoke, when the subject matter was
resurrected. I wish, therefore, to make
a public apology to my colleagues, not
for having stated Mr Reynolds’ criticism
had some justification, but for having
said anything which could have been
erroneously attributed to what happened
after other Members had spoken. In(
Parliamentary debates the original cause!
is often lost in the welter of subsequent
disputation which, in this case, rightly
or wrongly, arose out of concern for the
welfare of soldiers in the field on both
sides of the House. The term “gigglers”
may be good or bad journalism, but in
either case I consider it was both un-
called for and undeserved.

Reserve Price Predictions
SIR. —ln your article on the Reserve
Scheme, “Turn and Turn About”
Oct. 23), the following sentence
|ippears: “In 1967 the Government con-
tribution to promotion and research
at present £2 for every £1 contributed by
growers—is supposed to come back to
H for £l.”
This is inaccurate as to fact and mis-
leading as to prediction. At present the
research levy is 2s. per bale and the
corresponding Government contribution
is 4s. The levy for promotion is based
on value of the clip and not on weight
or volume, but in round figures the
grower contributes 275. per bale and
the Government 17s. Hence the grower
contribution to promotion and research
is 295. and the Government contribution
21s. per bale. As to what is “supposed”
to happen in 1967, discussions with
Government on the future of promotion
and research levies, and on the contri-
bution which may come from industry
and Government respectively, have not
been held. Indeed it will be some months
before the Wool Industry Conference is
in a position to reach a decision on future
research requirements.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Bonynge’s Last Words
From BETTY BEST in London
If ever two people returned from a
project overjoyed, elated and keen
to repeat it, they are Joan Suther-
land and Richard Bonynge. Just one
month after their closing night in Bris-
bane I went to see them in their London
home and found them both bursting with
enthusiasm for everything from audien-
ces to their company, from the musical
potential of Australia to its development
as a nation.
Nothing seemed to have disappointed
them and it was with trepidation that I
mentioned their ructions with the Syd-
ney Press. When I did they both laughed
good-naturedly and Bonynge said:
“Oh, really, that blew over as soon as
it blew up. I’m sure there are no hard
feelings on either side now. The trouble
was that we arrived from the Melbourne
and Adelaide seasons absolutely exhaust-
ed. We were shocked at the wild hoohah
at Mascot instead of being complimented
as, I suppose, we should have been.
“Anyhow, neither Joan nor I have any
hard feelings. We are really bored with
the whole business now. Perhaps that
kind of harrying is part of modern civili-
sation and one just gets used to it. It is
such a small thing compared with the
fantastic welcome that we received every-
where and the magnificent success of the
tour that we just never think about it
any more.”
That dealt with. I asked him if the
tour had worked out exactly as he
thought it would when he had talked
to me for The Bulletin just before leav-
ing London.
BONYNGE: That’s hard to answer
because one never knew how it would
work out. It was a gamble from start
to finish. We took out seven operas
of which two or three were completely
unknown entities to the Australian public.
Of course, we had faith in them but
until we saw them a success we didn’t
know what to expect. We just felt for-
tunate that Sir Frank Tait let us take
them. There are very few managements
which would have been so brave.
He knew as well as we did that the
Australian public would love to see no-
thing better than “La Boheme”, “Tra-
viata”, “Madame Butterfly” and “II Tro-
vatore” over and over again, and that
99 per cent of the Australian public
knew nothing about “Semiramide” and
“Sonnambula”. Yet in the last analysis
these two were the great success of the
entire season.
We have had more letters about those
two operas than any of the others. And
when you consider that we are still get-
ting batches of hundreds of letters for-
warded here from Covent Garden and
the Metropolitan in New York every
week, all from Australia, you can see
how much that means.
The response to these two operas,
even on first nights which are usually
more social than musical, was over-
whelming. In fact, on every single night
of the tour when we performed either
“Semiramide” or “Sonnambula” they
were absolute house bringers-down.
We were not so surprised about the
success of “Lucia” because it has been a
great vehicle for Joan all over the world
and there was no reason to think it
would be any different in Australia.
“Traviata”, too, we hoped would be
popular, as indeed it was.
I won’t say that “Eugene Onegin" was
a critical success but I do know that
those who saw it liked it very much. I
think we did reasonably good per-
formances of what is, after all, a terribly
difficult opera to perform. I have seen
it many times at the Metropolitan, and in
London and Europe and I think our per-
formances compared more than favorably
with all of these.
“L’Elisir d’Amore” I also thought was
charmingly performed and proved a
great popular success. So I can honestly
say that the season exceeded all our wild-
est expectations.
One goes with great trepidation back
to one’s own country, especially after 15
years. And to be received as we were
(I am sure the Australian public must
be one of the warmest in the world) was
absolutely thrilling.
We had completely forgotten this Aus-
tralian habit of throwing streamers and
going wild as they do. The closing night
in Melbourne, for instance, came as a
complete surprise to us all, and it will
be the most memorable night we shall
ever have.
As Sir Frank Tait told us himself, it
was the greatest night he had ever seen in
any theatre. It certainly was the great-
est we’d ever seen. And by “we” I mean
the whole company. They were over-
whelmed. It was a heart-warming and
wonderful night and set the pattern for
the whole season from there on.
It was, of course, a hard season. We
gave eight performances a week. We
had put on seven brand new productions
in five weeks - which lam sure is a
world record. But I have never worked
with a happier company. At the end
there was not a single member who was
not sorry that the season was over.
BEST: Did you have any musical dif-
ficulties or production difficulties which
forced you to change your plans at the
last minute?
BONYNGE: No, most things went as
planned musically. Occasionally, one
made a slight change in casting but no-
thing vital. In fact, everyone stood very
much on their own feet, and when given
a role really made something of it. There
were very few members of the com-
pany who didn’t improve during the
season. Many of the performances that
the singers gave in Australia were sup-
erior to those they have given in Europe
and in America in the past.
BEST: Did this also apply to Joan, do
you think?
BONYNGE: Yes, I think she gave
some very stunning performances in
Australia. Especially in “Traviata”. Pos-
sibly better than many she has done over-
seas.. Like everyone else performing three
times a week with the same company in
the same surroundings she became more
relaxed.
For myself I felt much more relaxed
on going into the pit than Eve ever felt
in any other theatres in Europe or Ame-
rica. That first round of applause they
give a conductor is a personal welcome.
They were sitting there, expecting to be
entertained and looking forward to the
evening’s enjoyment.
Now I feel that if we go back we could
take almost any opera that we wanted to,
the more unknown the better, and I’m
sure people would come to see them. This
is a terrific discovery.
BEST: Have you planned a date for
your return?
BONYNGE: No, the time hasn’t been
decided. But, of course, we want to go
back. We will go back. We must go
back.
BEST: Do you feel that you have
learned any lessons to help in the plan-
ning of your next tour?
BONYNGE: Yes, I certainly do. As
far as I can see the Australian public
wants bel canto opera, and they want
good singers. They will never accept
anything that is second-rate, from here
on. And wTiy should they?
BEST: Do you feel that you learned
anything about the forming of a com-
pany or did you have exactly what you
wanted both musically in the pit an “
on stage?
BONYNGE: No, of course, we didnt
have exactly what we wanted because
that is a perfection we are never going
to get. It was very hard to put together
an orchestra of very high standard


Australia at this time because the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra had already taken
25 floating players to London for the
Commonwealth Arts Festival. That
meant that there were not so many to
choose from. At the beginning it was
hard work for all of us because they
had never played together before and
although there were some very fine play-
ers in the orchestra, there were bound
to be some less good ones. But by the
time the season got going they were
playing sometimes extremely well. I think
that they got very little credit for the
good work they did.
BEST: Do you blame the critics for
that?
BONYNGE: As I understand it, the
critics anywhere in the world. I wouldn't
dream of it. They do their job and I
do mine. But on the whole the Aus-
tralian critics are very fair, I think.
BEST: How would you sum up the
orchestral work of the season?
BONYNGE: The orchestra improved
all-the time. They were a really good
opera orchestra because they understood
how to accompany. If one wanted them
to play softly they played softly. They
followed the rubati and all the ups and
downs of bel canto opera: it is not
straight playing as it is in symphony
work, and I enjoyed them personally.
'I give them full marks for being very
willing and very adaptable. They cotton-
ed on to the styles of the different operas
exceptionally well. I do think that some
technical playing of some of the members
was at times a little below par but on the
other hand they were terribly quick to
catch on to work they had never attempt-
ed before. Therefore it was never an
unhappy experience for me to work with
them.
And the chorus we had there was, I
must say, the greatest chorus I’ve ever
worked with. The best on any operatic
stage. Oh, they are quite wonderful!
Quite extraordinary! Well, they were
hand-picked, and we had many, many
soloists who came to work with us be-
cause they wanted to be with the com-
pany in any capacity. I think they all en-
joyed the experience and I hope they
found it worthwhile.
I only hope that this chorus can stay
together as much as possible. But, of
course, a lot of them want to come
overseas now and try their luck here,
an d I think that many of them will
have success because they have determin-
ation. They are ready to work and cer-
tainly they have the voices and the
dramatic understanding.
It just wasn’t the tired old chorus that
°ne frequently finds in many European
theatres. They are young and keen. The
Natural Australian voice is a good one,
you know, and all those that we had
were young, healthy voices.
To give you some idea of what I mean,
one musician with the company who
went straight back to the Metropolitan
in New York told me last week that he
could hardly believe his disappointment
when he heard the Met chorus again after
ours in Australia. “Our 36 sounded so
much better than their 78,” he said, “and
the quality of the sound in Australia was
much greater.”
BEST: Do you regard the tour as
having been a financial success?
BONYNGE: As I understand it, the
company lost almost no money, that
is, something in the vicinity of £20,000.
This is nothing in the language of inter-
national opera companies. In fact, it is
a phenomenal achievement. We took
an entire company of singers out from
Europe and America, we built seven
entirely new productions, completely new
costumes (sometimes two or three sets
of them because of the alternating
soloists). And in only 14 weeks to get all
that money back is extraordinary. We
must not forget that all big world opera
houses like La Scala, Covent Garden
and the Met are very very highly sub-
sidised. So, of course, is the Elizabethan
Trust in Australia and I know that in
the past seasons they have lost heavily.
They were underwriting this season, of
course, so the loss will be equally divid-
ed between them and Williamson’s which
will only amount to about £lO,OOO or
£12,000 each, which is something we
can be very proud of.
BEST: So on the whole you have no
real regrets on looking back over the
last few months.
BONYNGE: Good heavens, no. We
had, of course, one great sadness in the
death of Sir Frank Tait. It was a ter-
rible shock to us and a great loss to
Australian theatre. We shall never cease
to be grateful to him for the faith he
had in us which made the tour possible.
And we are only happy that we were
the last big project in his life and that
we know he was made genuinely happy
at the realisation of one of his great
ambitions before he died.
Richard Bonynge and Joan Suther-
land have a packed year ahead of them.
After Christmas, which they hope to
spend in their new house in Switzerland
(“so that Adam can have a real Christ-
mas tree which we cut down ourselves”),
they return to London.
Here they will record “Semiramide”
with two members of the Australian com-
pany, Joseph Rouleau and Spiro Malas.
Then another complete recording of
“Beatrice de Tenda” with Pavarotti and
Opthof. Both these operas will be ac-
companied by the London Symphony
Orchestra conducted by Richard Bo-
nynge.
Beginning in February they will do a
concert tour of London, Paris, Copen-
hagen, Antwerp, Hamburg and Munich.
When they return to London they will
go into rehearsals at Covent Garden with
a new production of Donizetti’s “Daugh-
ter of the Regiment” and make a com-
plete recording of “Faust”.
Meanwhile Miss Sutherland will have
sung in a La Scala production of “Don
Giovanni” in April, and made her much-
longed-for record with Noel Coward of
some ballads from five of his musicals.
After the Covent Garden season both
Bonynge and Sutherland will fly to San
Francisco to do “1 Puritani” before re-
turning to the Metropolitan in New York
where for the first time Bonynge will
conduct Sutherland’s famous “Lucia di
Lammermoor”.

Addicts of film have known for some
time that old movie TV viewing
conditions here are easily the best in
the world: in Britain, hats are flung in
the air at the occasional appearance of
a vintage Preston Sturges or John Ford
film, while in the United States aK
though the actual number of films shown
is far greater they are brutally hack-
ed, shown at ridiculous hours of the
night or day (“Rasputin and the Empress”
back in the news because of the Yous-
soupoF case was once shown in three
parts before breakfast in New York)
and displayed on perhaps the world's
worst image. Here, for several years
now, night-time screenings have been
shown uncut, the advance studio build-
ups are frequently intelligent, and, in
“TV Times”, Bill Collins, w'eek after
week, provides an astonishingly know'-
lecUeable guide to what is being shown.
Recently, the feasts for the gourmet
have been startlingly lavish, even by
local standards. And the Festivals —■
groups of films by one director or featur-
ing one star are not only invaluable
but, to my knowledge, unique in the
world. Where else could one possibly
see a succession of Von Sternberg films
from the early thirties in succession
under the heading of The Dietrich Festi-
val? ATN has already shown the splen-
did “Shanghai Express” screenings of
this would be regarded as a treat at the
National Film Theatre in London or the
Museum of Modern Art in New York
and we are to get “Morocco”, “Dis-
honored”, and, 1 hope, “The Scarlet Em-
press” (perhaps we can be shown Von
Sternberg's very rare “Thunderbolt” and
“Sergeant Madden”, just so we’re
thoroughly spoilt).
TCN has been running a rip-roaring
Errol Flynn Festival: that flat Tasmanian
voice, whisky advertisement face, ele-
gant fencer’s figure and searchlight smile
have been displayed in 11 films already,
the best of them directed with unequalled
brio by Michael Curtiz. “Captain Blood”
a superbly abandoned version of a Saba-
tini novel, went with a wonderfully
muscular drive and pace; “Robin Hood”
remains the ideal boy’s film, and “The
Charge of the Light Brigade” never
faltered, from a splendid opening at a
tiger hunt through sieges and infantry
clashes in blazing white sun to the final,
Hentyish scene of the charge itself, the
camera whizzing like a falcon down a
long valley, horsemen tumbling to their
deaths, vultures wheeling above the spears
and sabres, and Tennyson’s doggerel poem
spelled out in titles over the heroic
images.
The Cecil B. DeMille Festival, un-
fortunately, looks like being rather
short-lived: it will be interesting to see
“Dynamite”, set at the very end of the
Jazz Age, with a wonderful evocation
of a vanished period and a rousing climax
of a mining disaster, and “Madame
Satan”, which ends up with a Zeppelin
fancy-dress ball over New York, the
Zeppelin breaking up and, symbolically
(this was the time of the Wall Street
crash), precipitating its wealthy cargo
into the night. In the meantime there
has been plenty to go on with: “Reap
the Wild Wind”, in which a giant squid
tangles with Ray Milland, ships are sunk
and brave divers come home to warm,
crinolined women; “Union Pacific”, in
which Barbara Stanwyck in a weird Irish
accent helps get the railroad across the

Waiting for Mavis
The Mavis Bramston Show. ATN chan-
nel 7.
HThe Mavis Bramston Show is unique
A in one respect. It is the only show
in Australia whose commercials often
carry it. The home viewer sits through
songs, sketches, recitations, small witti-
cisms and large vulgarities, waiting for
Mavis Bramston to enliven the show.
Somehow I feel this is not the way it was
intended to be.
The Bramston Show began a little
more than one year ago as a bold
venture, with the impossible aim of
giving Sydney viewers a weekly round
of satirical songs and sketches, up to
the minute, daring, and iconoclastic.
When inspiration ran out, some very
queasy humor came in. Members of
Parliament and the clergy made oc-
casional objections, usually about the
wrong things.
In its birthday edition, three weeks
ago, the Mavis Bramston Show did give
indications that its new producer, Peter
Myers, is thinking of next year and what
direction the show might take to struggle
for survival. In that birthday edition,
Hazel Phillips shone in three brief
sketches which depended on her ability
to “get” the characters of Marlene Diet-
rich, Dawn Lake and a bemused school-
girl. The songs were more numerous,
the soot content was reduced and the
atmosphere was livelier for that.
But last week’s show was back to its
aimless norm, with one shattering new
note, sentiment, and sloppy, pathetic
sentiment at that. If these are pointers
to the future, I don't see one. Although
the Mavis Bramston Show makes
frequent critical references to Bobby
Limb’s show, the drift towards it is
evident, and regrettable.
I have ambivalent feelings about the
Mavis Bramston Show. I have never
liked it very much. The waits for really
funny or sharply barbed material are
too long, with too much genuine drivel
between. But 1 would hate to see the
show go. Its existence has proved that
writers can be found, that there are
actors and that such a showcase could
enable them to develop sharp talents.
That these possibilities have come to so
little is the saddest thing. It is possible
that success has ruined the Mavis Brarn-
ston Show.

much has already been written in
critical evaluation of this extraor-
dinary play, that a further painful probe
into its religious and political implica-
tions would risk both tedium and point-
lessness. Gerstein, the play’s S.S. “double
agent” says “We are also guilty if we
keep silence”. Any reasonable jury, after
witnessing Hochhuth’s relentless three-
hour indictment of Pius XII, would pro-
bably agree but they may also feel
that the case for the Defence had been
presented with something less than
thoroughness or objectivity.
Considering the inflammable nature of
the play’s ingredients, it is strange that
this production by the South Australian
Theatre Company and the University
Theatre Guild has relatively little im-
pact.
Dennis Olsen’s Riccardo is rarely the
dedicated, frustrated savior with whom
the audience can eagerly identify. His
ultimate confrontation with Pius XII
during which he produces and wears the
Star of David has a convincing sense of
drama and tension, and his last scene,
with the monstrous doctor at Auschwitz,
is considerably affecting. But in the
play’s important early scenes, Olsen’s
handling of Riccardo’s deep sense of out-
rage and protest too often comes across
as a sort of arch petulance. His charac-
terisation in this role is not noticeably
dissimilar from his work in “Private
Lives” and “Inadmissible Evidence”. And
it should have been.

manding study of icy inhumani y as the
German doctor. Vocally high-voltage and
stage-filling in its authority, his perform-
ance is further evidence of impressive
potential. Gordon McDougall dissem-
bles chubbily and with reasonable effect
as the Cardinal; Ted Hodgeman almost
paints a portrait of the rather faceless
Father General.
But this is seldom an actor's play. Its
massive and sickening theme dwarfs per-
sonalities and performances; it demands
a producer who can present its awesome
submission in theatrical terms. John
Tasker’s production fails in this delicate
and difficult assignment. Just before the
final curtain there is a fiim w'hich shows,
in horrifying and gruesome detail, scenes
of the mass murder. Its effect W’as elec-
tric and immediate; the atmosphere in
the auditorium was instantly chilled with
waves of mute revulsion and guilt. But
our consciences should have been craw-
ling long before then.
The backdrop for “The Sport of My
Mad Mother” is a rubbish dump. Like
a grotesque altar, studded with its sord-
id offerings, it rears behind the action.
The action itself is a wild, way-out, sad,
savage and satirical comment on contem-
porary youth. Moments of genuine
pathos or drama give suddenly way to a
zany improvisation of rock ’n’ roll. The
play is orchestrated throughout by a lone
but eloquent guitar. It seems often to be
something which Pinter and lonesco may
have whipped up at a party as an in-joke,
but it emerges as a piece of provocative
and vigorously entertaining theatre.
Colin Ballantyne has taken this im-
probable extravagance and, with obvious
relish, has shaped a disciplined, autho-
ritative, experienced and imaginative pro-
duction. The lighting, groupings, move-
ment and effects are all achieved with
skilful precision; an inexperienced cast
has been effectively drilled into perform-
ances which are often stimulating, always
satisfactory. A bold and worthwhile ex-
periment.

MUSSC
Heinze’s Varieties
Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Conductor,
Heinze; soloist, Vasary. Town Hall.
T think it was early in 1947 that 1
A first heard a Sydney subscription con-
cert conducted by Sir Bernard Heinze,
then full-time Professor of Music in
Melbourne, and there’s been hardly a
season since then without his appearance
on the Sydney rostrum. On quite a few
of these many occasions, Sir Bernard fail-
ed to impress me as a forceful or con-
vincing conductor, but he has always
proved a courageous programme builder,
indeed often an adventurous one. In his
determination to break down the con-
servatism of our benighted audiences, my
notes show him as presenting works by
Bartok, Vaughan-Williams, Alfred Hill,
Schonberg. Kabalevsky, Ibert, Hindemith,
Shostakovich, Bloch, Telemann, Kodaly,
C. P. E. Bach and Britten.
The final concerts of the 1965 sub-
scription season were no exception: four
of the five works heard in the last
two programmes were composed during
Sir Bernard’s musical life. With un-
flagging, youthful catholicity, Sir Bernard
programmed Shostakovich’s sth Sym-
phony, the E Major Sinfonietta by
Hindemith, Sibelius’ 7th Symphony and
Bartok's 3rd Piano Concerto; I for one,
am grateful to him.
What of the music? Although, by
ABC standards, four of the five works
would be described as “contemporary”,
they range in time from 1924 (Sibelius)
to 1949 (Hindemith) and have very little
in common idiomatically. Here was ex-
cellent proof, if such were needed, that
the music of recent decades is more
varied than that of any earlier period.
Sibelius’ 7th, his crowning achievement,
had not been played in Sydney for many
years. Although the music is very
characteristic of Sibelius, it is more
difficult for performers and listeners than
some of the more popular, earlier, Sibe-
lius symphonies. The performance on
this occasion was convincing and the
interpretation quite valid even though
(insufficient rehearsal?) it was a little
lacking in dramatic contrast.
The Hindemith Sinfonietta, previously
not known to me, might well have been
called a symphony; it is in four move-
ments, uses a full orchestra and lasts 22
minutes! Commissioned by the Louis-
ville Orchestra, it shows signs of the
composer's endeavor to write for audi-
ence-acceptance and to devise an orche-
stral showpiece. The music is free of the
aridity often associated with Hindemith
and in the first, fast, movement, there
are flashes of almost Gallic wit. The
viola, Hindemith's own instrument and
abiding love, is prominently used in the
adagio. The whole of the attractive work
was well played, despite some minor dif-
ficulties with the jerky beat of the inter-
mezzo.
The centre pieces of both program-
mes were piano concerti, superlatively
played by Tamas Vasary. Bartok's 3rd
(1945) concerto is not the fearsome
thing listeners usually expect from late
Bartok. In fact, it is easy and entertain-
ing and includes both romantic and
jazzy sections. Despite its difficulties, the
orchestra acquitted themselves splendid-
ly, Sir Bernard kept a firm grip and
Vasary sparkled. The 2nd Chopin con-
certo, in the other programme, proved
him the complete master.
The second half of both programmes
consisted of Shostakovich's enormous sth
symphony, written in 1937. It has become
the composer's most popular work, which
is hardly surprising when one remembers
that it was intended as a demonstration of
his ability to please the masses. Despite
many of the devices used in it. this music
belongs to the 19th rather than the
20th century and is not nearly as original
as some of the composer's more recent
music, when he felt free to write without
quite such heavy ideological pressure.

IIfHAT promised to be the dullest event
of the year, the official film of the
Tokyo Olympic Games, turns out in
Ichikawa’s hands to be one of the most
exciting and entertaining. Its sheer film-
craft is breathtaking, but while the eye is
beguiled, the mind and emotions are also
engaged by the director’s passionate,
humorous interest in the people
involved.
For while Ichikawa gives full value
to the pageantry of the event the
early sequences of the arrival of the
Olympic Flame and the opening of the
Games are memorable his real in-
terest is in the people involved. Instead
of a celluloid sports-page earnestly
recording who won what, he gives us a
living picture of the strain, tension and
excitement of the athlete. “I tried,” he
says, “to seize the instant when a man
defies his own limits.”
Though Ichikawa looks at his subjects
unsentimentally, sometimes with slight
malice, there is no mistaking the warmth
of his concern with human beings as
individuals. So quite apart from its
greater technical brilliance, his film is
much more acceptable than Leni Riefen-
stahl’s much-praised film of the 1936
Olympics, with its Nietzschean superman
complex.
I never thought I’d see the day when
anyone stole a movie from Peter Sellers,
but two young actresses, Tippy Walker
and Merrie Spaeth, manage it in “The
World Of Henry Orient”. As a pair of
fourteen-year-olds whose juvenile crush
on a concert pianist nearly ruins the poor
man’s life, they are human, funny,
thoroughly likeable without any hint
of cuteness.
Not that Sellers is below form; his
portrait of the self-centred Orient is
a two-dimensional caricature, but a bril-
liantly drawn one, and the scene in which
he plays a desperately avant-garde con-
certo is a hilarious commentary on the
sillier aspects of modern music. George
Roy Hill, not one of the jazzier direc-
tors, enters surprisingly into the zany
spirit of the film, and his imaginatively
photographed sequence of the girls run-
ning through the streets of New York
is extremely effective.
Comedy and Ingmar Bergman don’t
really go together, and though there are
some amusing moments in “All These
Women”, it is generally self-conscious,
repetitive and long-winded. It is still
well worth seeing for its visual beauty.
Bergman’s first use of color is subtle and
inventive; the composition and shading
of the images is a constant surprise and
pleasure.
So many shattering things have hap-
pened in the last 30 years that the abdica-
tion of Edward VIII seems now a storm
in a teacup, and the lack of impact of
“A King’s Story” is more noticeable be-
cause of the extreme tact and discretion
of its makers.
The documentary has a wealth of
historically interesting but disorganised
material, with a slightly pompous nar-
ration and occasional comments from
the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who
have worn remarkably well but who
don’t have anything very stimulating to
say for themselves. “A great queen,” is
the Duke’s verdict on Queen Victoria;
“when she died it was the end of an
era”. And the Duchess recalls that after
Edward’s proclamation as king, “I turn-
ed to him and said; ‘How different your
life is going to be’.”

BOOKS
John Gunther’s Europe
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Procession. John Gunther. Hamish Hamil-
ton. 445. 6d.
John Gunther belongs to a vanishing
breed, the breed of plain, honest-to-
God political reporters who write down
what they see and hear with little over-
burden of philosophical reflection. Before
the war there were several of them in
orbit round the international scene.
Their status was pretty high. The ante-
rooms of dictators and prime ministers
opened to them surprisingly freely;
though not so surprisingly, perhaps, as
the political bosses regarded them, some-
times justifiably, more often than not
mistakenly, as useful means of transmit-
ting their opinions to the world at a
rather more sophisticated level than
official handouts and the Press bureaux
on the spot. Gunther was the best of
the roving reporters and he has proved
the most durable. After 30 years he is
still circulating, albeit in lower gear,
round the trouble spots of Europe, Asia,
Africa and America, an ambient Boswell
of the portable typewriter.
“Procession” is a collection of potted
profiles of world figures culled mostly
from the pages of the best-selling
“Inside” books and their sequels. It
begins with Mussolini, Hitler and Stalin
as Gunther saw them in the mid-1930s
and ends with Khrushchev, Adenauer
and Harold Wilson in the early 19605.
In between it covers a whole spectrum
of characters —De Valera, Gandhi, De
Gaulle, La Guardia, Tito, Haile Selassie,
Nkrumah, Dr Schweitzer and a dozen
others, ranging down to now largely
forgotten United States presidential pos-
sibilities like Earl Warren and Leverett
Saltonstall.
BENITO MUSSOLINI
The disadvantages of a scissors-and-
paste compilation like this are obvious.
The lesser known figures, and even some
of the greater ones, are likely to appear
dangling in vacuo when divorced from
their contemporary surrounding text.
Gunther has partly got over this difficulty
by adding up-to-date notes fore and aft
of each profile. He also assures us that
he has not tinkered with the opinions
he originally expressed. In any case this
would hardly have been necessary.
Gunther was, and is, an extremely
shrewd observer and many of his fore-
casts when he committed himself to
a definite prognosis have been
amply confirmed.
What then is the value of this book?
Serious students of contemporary and
near-contemporary politics will naturally
turn to the “Inside” volumes themselves
if they are interested in what one com-
petent American reporter had to say
about the world scene. A mass of easily
accessible biographical information is
available about most of the characters
with whom he deals. No-one would
suggest that Gunther is worth reading
for his prose style. (However, he was
capable of tossing off a memorable
phrase. For instance, his remark' that
the mind of Senator John Bricker was
“like interstellar space a vast vacuum
crossed occasionally by homeless, wan-
dering cliches”. Or his description of
the suite of King Idris of Libya:
“magnificent tribal sheikhs, slim, cloudily
silent and immobile; they looked like
white fingers, with nails for faces”. T. E.
Lawrence would have been proud of
that one. It may not be significant that
the Empress of Abyssinia is “a large
woman, rhomboidal in shape”, but it
conjures up an entertaining vision.)
I think Gunther would have produced
a better book if he had jettisoned some
of the earlier chapters, especially those
about the pre-war dictators. There is
inevitably a jarring superficiality now
about a reference to Hitler as “this
paunchy, Charlie-Chaplin-moustached
man, given to insomnia and emotional-
ism”. Stuff like this provides ammunition
for the critics who dismiss Gunther’s
writings as mere ephemera, like yester-
day’s newspaper. Similarly his portraits
of Stalin and Mussolini are of only
mild historical importance. Too much
has happened since Gunther was explor-
ing that queer twilight European world
of the 19305. In 1935 it was still pos-
sible to regard the dictators as
curiosities rather than monsters. How-
ever, it must be said that Gunther saw
their menace more clearly than many
of his colleagues. He was not immune
from the widespread disbelief that the
Nazis and Fascists would be mad
enough to launch a World War. He
forecast the eventual overthrow of both
regimes and he was right of course
after Europe had been torn apart and
reassembled in the process.
The best pieces in “Procession” are
those dealing with less world-shattering
figures. His portrait of Trotsky in exile
on the island of Prinkipo, his hour-by-
hour account of a day in the life of
Mayor La Guardia and his descriptions
of encounters with Marshal Tito and
Dr Schweitzer are minor masterpieces
of straight, objective reporting. Gunther
is at his best when he simply sets down
what he sees and hears and he has the
true Bosw'ellian knack, the artless gift
of selecting the fact that illuminates
from among all the facts that obscure.
His picture of Albert Schweitzer, that
extraordinary compound of charity and
arrogance, of piety and pig-headedness,
toiling in the squalor of Lambarene is
the most remarkable portrait of the
formidable old man I have seen in
print. Africa seems to bring out some
of the best in Gunther, for he is good
too on Nasser, Haile Selassie and his
fantastically-contrasting brace of Negro
presidents, Tubman of Liberia and
Nkrumah of Ghana.
Gunther delights in cataloguing the
minutiae of his subject’s personal
appearance. Of Khrushchev for instance:
“He has a silver fringe of hair, an
upturned nose, three small chins and
twinkling, very dark small eyes set
widely apart and deep. It is hard to
tell their color probably deep brown.
Two gold teeth shine when he smiles,
and a gap is noticeable between the two
upper front teeth; he has one mole, or
wart, next to his nose on his left cheek,
The Outlook at Middle-Age
To have walked out angry and cleaned it
up,
Flattened the dragon, spoken right out
Regardless of who spluttered in his cup,
Is what the earlier attitude was about,
A negative honesty both crude and cruel
Driving the world on its rails oneself
the fuel.
Now, to sit quietly while the dragons roar
Unravel gentleness and take calm tea
Knowing that most of this has happened
before;
The self-perpetuating errors of history
Are not your concern. Now, if you do not
burn,
It’s because you doubt you can teach but
have much to learn.

no doubt, but the sort of trivia that
biographers will be glad of one day.
It would be fascinating to have the same
sort of snippets of information about
Hannibal and Charlemagne.
One refreshing thing about Gunther
is that he is obviously a product of the
pre-Cold War age. In his later chapters
he may make an occasional genuflection
towards the simple State Department
foreign policy of Goodies versus Baddies,
but he still writes with the dispassionate
curiosity of a good reporter. What pre-
judices he has flourish most strongly
in his native American soil. He
apparently disliked Macarthur, held
Eisenhower in modest esteem and
admired Roosevelt, about whom he writes
with unusual warmth while admitting
the usual charges of FDR’s duplicity and
pettiness on occasions.
“Procession” is an extremely read-
able book all through. Gunther fans
who enjoyed getting the “Inside” books
from their local libraries will be glad
to have many of his best pieces collected
between the covers of a single volume.
Intellectual Strip-tease
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Force of Circumstance. Simone de Beauvoir.
Deutsch and Weidenfeld & Nicolson. 89s.
"Pgg-headed whore, chieftainess, lady
manager, fishwife, schoolmarm . .
these are some of the names which have
Teen slung at Simone de Beauvoir. The
main target, of course, has been the
notoriously unconventional association
with Jean-Paul Sartre which has lasted
more than three decades, but her book
about women, “The Second Sex” (that
created a scandal long before “The
Group”), her political writings in “Les
Temps Modernes” and elsewhere, and
her Existentialist philosophy have also
been enough to make her one of the
most discussed Frenchwomen of the
period.
The 658-page intellectual strip-tease
that continues Simone de Beauvoir’s two
ear]ier volumes of autobiography
(“Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter” and
'Prime of Life”) from the Liberation of
Paris to 1963 will prove a remarkable
reference book for future generations,
Throughout, there is a vivid sense of
history in the making, of the past actually
being lived, even if seen only through
deep-pink lenses (she considers herself
Leftist but not Communist). But with
ber the variants of this color seem to
vacillate considerably.
The “Deux Magots” atmosphere, the
intelligentsia of Paris, the almost picture-
postcard accounts of her numerous
travels, the manner in which she and
Sartre help each other’s work with
devastatingly candid criticism are all de-
SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR
picted. It is a revealing document, but
by no means all-revealing. The fascina-
tion of this autobiography lies as much
in what is discreetly left unsaid. During
the lifetime of the chief participants one
expects the live bodies to be treated more
circumspectly than at the autopsies that
will no doubt be performed upon them
later on.
Yet everywhere there are signs that the
bed Simone de Beauvoir made for her-
self so long ago has grown uncomfort-
able.-She has recurring, horrifying night-
mares which she recounts in detail: a
record-player that revolves out of control
and disintegrates when she pulls out the
plug—it is her own person being
wrecked by the mysterious and untam-
able force of time and of circumstance.
She is suddenly obsessed with the fear of
old age and death, of dying before Sartre
and being unable to comfort him over
her loss, or of his dying before she does,
leaving her alone. Finally, looking back
at her full life and unique achievements
she exclaims, “The promises have all
been kept. And yet ... I realise with
stupor how much I was gypped.” (In-
cidentally, this is one of the few passages
where Richard Howard's translation reads
like one.)
Simone de Beauvoir has been every-
It is March
It is March and black dust falls out of
the books
Soon I will be gone
The tall spirit who lodged here has
Left already
On the avenues the colorless thread lies
under
Old prices
When you look back there is always the
past
Even when it has vanished
But when you look forward
With your dirty knuckles and the wingless
Bird on your shoulder
What can you write
Ihe bitterness Is still rising in the old
mines
The fist is coming out of the egg
The thermometers out of the mouths of
the corpses
At a certain height
The tails of the kites for a moment are
Covered with footsteps
Whatever I have to do has not yet begun

where, from Brazil to China, rrom Italy
to Moscow-. Yet a frantic, almost com-
pulsive pattern seems to emerge, an
attempt to escape something she will
never be able to elude, because it goes
with her. There is nothing sadder than
the day she (who has always had an
Epicurean appreciation of beautiful
things) finds herself in Ravenna again
and cannot be bothered looking at the
mosaics!
True to their curious arrangement, she
inoulge* in a serious affair with the
American writer Nelson Algren, while
Sartre has to be rescued from the hysteri-
ca! tenacity of an American schemer she
calls “M” whose determination to marry
him is matched only by his own decision
to resist. But as Sartre once remarked
ironically to Simone de Beauvoir, their
position was not without advantage: they
could do whatever they wanted because
it could never be worse than what people
said they did, anyway.
Comments on Sartre’s work are scat-
tered throughout the book, chronologi-
cally not systematically, seen in time and
space rather than as a static idea. There
are interesting sidelights on the unpre.
dictability of the theatre: she records
how his play, “The Victors”, which
caused a major uproar (people fought in
the aisles) had undergone a metamor-
phosis between paper and stage, coming
alive so horrifyingly at the premiere that
the performance unnerved even Sartre
himself. She compares it with another
Resistance drama by Salacrou which ran
in Paris at Barrault’s Marigny Theatre
almost at the same time and concludes
that they both suffered from the same
faults. Portraits of heroism are not profit-
able; the villains come over better and
unhinge the balance of the plays.
To end speculation, there is a valuable
account of just how much true story,
how much fiction is contained in her own
Prix-Goncourt-winning novel, “The
Mandarins”. It is partly based on her
USA trips and her affaire with Algren,
but as a writer she has pulverised and
reassembled reality to reach a composite
that is more than either life or fiction.
However, her almost total rejection of
the works of Camus and her caustic dis-
missal of Nathalie Sarraute seem based
on more than pure intellect. One can
appreciate the argument in the case of
“The Plague”, that by allegorising the
Nazis (who could have been avoided)
as a natural disaster (that could not)
Camus dodges the whole issue of moral
responsibility; but to dismiss works like
“The Planetarium” as dealing with mere
“lower-middle-class paranoics” is to be
so intellectually blind as to be suspect of
actually not wishing to see. Yet, before
the war, when Nathalie Sarraute was
completely unknown, she had liked her
early “Tropisms” and later they had be-
come quite friendly. This did not prevent
Nathalie Sarraute from publishing an
article attacking “The Mandarins” for its
traditional, outmoded approach as against
the modern psychological one. Even egg-
headed ladies are only human!
Simone de Beauvoir's life seems to
have been a continual struggle to balance
theory and practice. The Algerian crisis
with its senseless atrocities left her com-
pletely shattered. She followed the path
her conscience indicated even when it
would have been tempting to take an
easier one. A plastic bomb blew up
Sartre’s apartment, there were riots, there
were the muddled and often obscure
political moves that culminated in de
Gaulle's election. She has clearly tried
to be guided by Existentialism as a defini-
tion of man through action which, if it
condemns him to anxiety, does so only in
so far as it obliges him to accept respon-
sibilities. Even if one cannot always agree
with the ways she chose, Simone de Beau-

A Corner of Sarsaparilla
By MAURICE SHADBOLT
(The Slow Natives. Thea Astley. Angus and
Robertson. 255.
Tlhea Astley’s last novel, “The Well
Dressed Explorer”, never entirely
.convinced me that her melancholy pro-
tagonist was worth all the talent she
[expended on him. And for all that novel’s
(interesting qualities, the failure was really
piss Astley’s: she had only half-found
ier subject. In focus and perspective she
never quite sharp enough. The same
(Complaint cannot be made about her new
(novel, “The Slow Natives”.
In the opening pages her dense, untidy
jand nervously rich style seems to be
[training for the focus and the precision
lie lacked before; and within a chapter
j two she clearly has the measure of her
Abject— and her man. His name is Ber-
nard Leverson, a middle-class and middle-
i ged teacher of suburban Brisbane. And
ier subject: middle-aged despair.
Somewhere on the perimeter of Ber-
nard Leverson's apathy exists his wife
iris and his rebellious, teenage son Keith,
le can watch his wife slide into point-
less adultery with hardly a qualm; he can
tjpel his son's consequent contempt with
Ik faintest of tremors. Like any human
leing, he is empowered to live and feel
jlly; but the occasion has long gone, if
ever really came. Even more remote
though not from the reader) are the
eople with whom he is involved in work
pd social life: priests, nuns and their
>upils; suburban intellectuals in the meta-
horical as well as literal sense of the
adjective (they, like him, exist in the
suburbs of the spirit).
Thea Astley’s gift for character is re-
markable. Through much of the novel,
teeming with sharply individualised
people and clicking with counterpoints,
the background threatens to take over
entirely; there is almost too much per-
spective. Leverson’s despair seems to find
an echo in every corner of his existence,
and there is no relief or escape. A stricken
nun, in some belated search for passion
of the soul, runs to his doorstep; a guilty
spinster, in a last cry for life, drags his
head into her lap. Miss Astley may really
be embroidering rather than exploring
her theme, but there is no evasion in the
embroidery itself; it is done in depth
and with superb narrative skill. And the
story moves with slow, measured beat to
the crisis in Leverson's life, when he
clings to his love for his maimed son
like a last dangling lifeline, and at last
feels the world awaken and revolve be-
neath him again. Even the years of des-
pair seem redeemed and justified by his
new knowledge.
For all this, however, “The Slow
Natives” seems to me a procession of
small triumphs rather than something
wholly successful in itself. Thea Astley’s
deliberate untidiness of style and con-
struction, so admirable at times in exactly
reflecting both the individual conscious-
ness and life at large, seems to let her
down before the end not even the fine
and moving ultimate scene quite pulls it
together. It remains a novel of characters
rather than of character. Yet Bernard
Leverson’s middle-aged aridity is real and
haunting, and the novel has a desperate
integrity which makes reservations seem
churlish. Her bitter humor never makes
for easy laughs; she constantly see-saws
between the comic and tragic without
losing her balance. I would like to list
some of the minor joys in this book
the clumsy, adolescent Chookie, for
example, and his flight from home with
the Leverson boy but there are really
too many. And much as I hate falling
back on a reviewer’s cliche, this time I
really do look forward to the author’s
next book; Thea Astley is developing
powerfully, and she has a corner of
Sarsaparilla all her own.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Where’s the Liquidity?
THIS is the time of the year in Australia for improved liquidity. The banks, in fact,
are showing just that, even if much less than last year. Yet some of the opinions
around town indicate that money remains tight. Restaurants in Sydney, for one
example, say that things are quiet.
The increase in unemployment in
October was to be expected in view of
the lay-offs in several industries
notably the automotive industry but
it will be interesting to note if final
November figures confirm that trend.
Some of the reported lay-offs in
employees continued into the early part
of November.
Undoubtedly the tough period
experienced by farmers in the drought
area must have its repercussions.
Reduced spending by farmers will cause
some restraint in other areas, while
lower export earnings must chip away
at overseas reserves.
Reduced returns from exports will
not be an overnight situation because it
is obvious that income for wheat,
wool, meat, etc., will be spread over
the coming year.
Already the effects of the ridiculously
low price for sugar are being felt.
Mr Ron Cameron, director of the
Australian Bankers’ Association, told
The Bulletin last week that the banks
had not noticed any severe demands for
drought relief (from credit - worthy
customers) and although it was expected
that increased demands would be made
for restocking of herds, etc., the trading
banks believed they would be well able
to cope with such demands.
Provisions already had been made for
this on instructions from the Reserve
Bank and it was unlikely that finance
for industry would have to be cut back
to meet increased demands from agri-
cultural sources. It seems that the
Reserve Bank will be happy so long as
new overdraft approvals do not exceed
the level of around £9m. a week.
Indeed, with the new banking move on
January 1, 1966, to charge a fee on the
unused portion of industrial overdrafts
above £50,000, overdraft limits could
become more realistic, leaving extra
funds for a. new breed of needy people.
The Reserve Bank, at a recent Press
conference, indicated that provisions had
been made to assist drought-stricken
farmers. The demands had not been
excessive. It is nevertheless true that
the pastoral companies (which provide
heavy credits to the agricultural industry)
have had their problems in the present
tight period. The Rural Bank of NSW
and the Commonwealth Development
Bank could also be an outlet for farm-
ers unable to obtain trading bank credit.
The Treasurer, Mr Holt, has recognised
the need for drought relief and has
offered some financial assistance, includ-
ing freight aid, to the State Governments
of NSW and Queensland
Looking towards next year, therefore,
when income from agricultural products
will be down, it would be reassuring
to Australia if there were compensating
revenue-earners. The long-term iron ore
contracts with Japan must take a while
to develop; although coal exports are
increasing, Australia is still relying fairly
heavily on primary products.
With wheat sales likely to be slashed
and sugar sales at a record low, there
is no room for enthusiasm. Business is
booming again in the US after the
escalation of the war in Vietnam, yet
this is not necessarily having a stimu-
lating effect on Australia’s exports.
With this in mind, it would be
unfortunate indeed, next year, if Aus-
tralia's prospective full in export income
should be accompanied by a downturn
in the American economy.
Meanwhile, the cost increases in Aus-
tralia which have been generated by
recent wage increases will be putting
further pressure on retail prices.
RONALD CAMERON
It is good that many big projects
aluminium, iron ore and oil exploratiory
are helping to generate increasei!
economic activity, allied with Govern
ment spending on public works ami
defence, but it is a pity that mom
money cannot be spent on defence pro-!
curement in Australia. Still, you can’t
have everything.
It is hoped that the recent easing of
activity in the building trades does notl
indicate a definite trend. If this down-
turn carries forward into next year,j
however, it could influence a lot of 1
people' to hold off on building plans, |
At this stage the outlook seems toi
be a matter of seeking as much value)
for money as circumstances allow. Which
suggests a continuation of high interest
rates.
British and American Share Markets
the very fair measure of vigor
and decisiveness recently, both Lon-
don and New York share markets put on
a rather lacklustre appearance last week
and without giving any obvious evidence
of jumping into a brighter mood. Not
that New York, for one, was in any way
short on volumes; trading has been at
quite high levels, on Wednesday in par-
ticular. Yet each place could best be
described as irregular and somewhat
negative in tone.
It is perhaps necessary to add that
neither market has basically weakened
since the lately accomplished general
body of advances.
But for a centre which still seems to
have taken Rhodesia in its investment
stride, London looked especially wan,
although the industrial index was dragged
back only a little and actually added
nearly two points on Friday. Volumes
were reduced, however, the institutions
were out and observers began to speak
about Christmas doldrums already.
Mr Clore played his offer for the Lewis
Investment Trust (including Selfridges
famous store) with exemplary skill. The
market's other glamor performers, shares
connected with North Sea gas, are now
being viewed in better proportion,
although some continue to remain un-
realistically priced
Individual company results are once
more exerting the main influence upon
equities as the credit squeeze seeps
through industry. Cunard, Tube Invest
ment and Wilkinson Sword led the depres-
sive mood, while the building section as
a whole most clearly expressed the
tightening squeeze.
Wall Street did not take very long to
recover from the shock of President John-
son's tussle with the aluminium companies.
There too, despite high-volume trading,
selectivity rules pretty widely.
Motors and steel are providing some-
what mixed performances. There's spec-
tacular activity among color television
issues.

Trading Bank Charges
Really Welcome
More efficient usage of credit
ANY step like the new trading bank charges on unused overdraft limits, designed
** to promote a more efficient usage of credit or capital, is as welcome as efforts
to increase the available supply of these resources and to improve the machinery for
marshalling and bringing them into service of the rapidly developing full employment
economy. If a criticism has to be made it is that the innovation was long overdue.
We have the Vernon Committee to
thank for bringing the banks and the
authorities to the point of action in this
matter. The idea of imposing the
charges has long been debated, but it
took the Committee to set it down as a
hard-and-fast recommendation. If only
in the interests of tightening their grip
on monetary control, the authorities
should have sponsored it long ago and
not left the trading banks to initiate it.
Similar charges have been ruling in most
big industrial countries these many years
(Sweden has a 1 per cent charge on
total overdraft facilities whether used or
not).
The new charges, to be operative here
from the beginning of next year, are on
a sliding scale applicable to the unused
portion of trading bank overdraft limits
of £50,000 and above. According to the
banks, overdraft limits of the majority
of borrowers are less than £50,000 and,
as numerous exceptions will be made
for cases where they are above that
figure, the charges will apply to only
a small number of accounts. Where only
10 per cent or less of an overdraft limit
is unused, no charge will apply. Above
10 per cent to 50 per cent unused, the
fee will be 10s. per cent a year; from
50 to 75 per cent unused it will be
155., rising to a maximum of 20s. per
cent when the unused portion is more
than 75 per cent.
Among the various affected borrowers,
possibly manufacturers will be thinking
hardest on the burden of carrying the
new charges. Their profit margins are
currently being squeezed as hard as any-
body's and at the latest count (July,
1965) they were using only 47 per cent
of their overdraft limits, about the same
proportion as finance companies. Both
these groups were using a far lower
proportion than the 631 per cent average
for all limits being used. Agricultural
borrowers, with the biggest advances of
any group in July (this was partly due
to seasonal influences which inflate their
advances in the winter months), were
Using 79.3 per cent of their limits in
lhat month compared with commerce
76 per cent, building and construction
66, and the general public (“persons”)
74 per cent.
On this showing no group would, as
a whole, incur the maximum charge of
£1 per annum. Even though the cases
would be rare, this is not to say some
individual borrowers within any one of
the groups would not be liable for it.
There would doubtless be a high in-
centive to lop something off a limit in
those cases and, indeed, for anybody
incurring the 15s. per cent rate.
One can only guess at the general
reaction of borrowers to the new charges.
Going on the experience of other coun-
tries there should eventually be a con-
siderable reduction in total overdraft
limits (a suggestion is that they will be
cut from £lOO to £2OO million from
their present £1987.1 million level
this must be judged a rather wild stab).
If this happens the banks will obviously
feel freer than they are now to spread
their lending capacity more widely.
Against this, the security backing re-
quired for limits will remain a strict
limiting factor in their decisions. Cer-
tainly, it cannot be presumed that the
move will in itself lead to increases in
bank advances, yet this cannot be ruled
out and maybe is highly likely in the
long run.
For the time being, however, the Re-
serve Bank’s restrictions on new bor-
rowing commitments still stand. This will
be an inhibiting factor, not only deterring
the spreading of limits more widely, but
also in determining whether clients with
established limits will scale them down
because of the charges. Once a limit is
forgone it could be very difficult to get
it re-established in current circumstances
and this may deter many borrowers from
reducing their limits despite the price of
retaining them.
Apart from their effects on the dis-
tribution and availability of credit the
new charges should have other useful
results for the banks and the financial
system. The banks, of course, will benefit
(modestly, in their opinion) from addi-
tional revenue at a time when their
profit margins are narrowing. This could
relieve some of the pressures on them

which'might otherwise have forced them
to increase charges in other directions.
They could also stand to gain new busi-
ness through diversion of borrowing
away from the inter-company market in-
to bank channels, but this, like the effects
on that market itself and their relation
to monetary control by the authorities,
must at this stage remain conjectural.
If a substantial layer is removed from
total overdraft limits the authorities are
far less likely than they have been in
the past to have their periodic attempts
to influence the effective volume of credit
frustrated by the cushioning effects of
the overdraft limits arrangement. Too
often in the past their efforts at credit
tightening have been followed simply
by a greater use of overdraft limits; in-
stead of getting a desired contraction in
bank advances the opposite has occurred.
Similarly, when essaying an easing of
credit, as in 1961-62, their designs have
often been thwarted by borrowers simply
increasing their overdraft limits unac-
companied by the desired increase in ad-
vances.
While the new charges would stillj
seem to leave unsolved most of the!
problem of bringing a large volume o(l
outlying credit within the direct control
of the authorities, a contraction in total
overdraft limits should assist in further
undermining the elusive (to the author!*
ties) inter-company money market. This/
grey eminence has already suffered to'
some extent from the successful designs!
of the authorities to woo an increasing-
amount of loose money into the
deposits of the trading banks,
In so far as the new charges will hava
the effect of reducing the profitability of
inter-comp.any lending where loans are
made on the security of unused bank
overdraft limits, they will doubtless cause,
a contraction in inter-company borrow-/
ing. But it must not be assumed that all
inter-company lending is done on the
security of unexercised bank overdraft
limits, or that the maximum overdraft!
charge of 20s. per cent will be applic- (
able to future business contracted in,
the market on the security of bank/

Leaves from the Tariff Book
The course of wages determination
TpARIFF BOARD members might be excused feeling rather frustrated after the
Government’s mauling of their recommendations on protection for crude oil and
textiles, but I found no obvious signs of this when sitting in on the final stages of
the Board’s aluminium inquiry in Canberra last week.
For, while they may be resigned to
the fact that the Board is but a tool of
ihe Department of Trade, the four-
member team conducting the aluminium
inquiry spared nothing in their astute
questioning of industrial witnesses. The
political overtones aside, we can be
thankful for the admixture of expertise
and dedication they are bringing to bear
in a series of broad industrial inquiries.
It is too bad that political wolves roam-
ing the adjacent Canberra parklands can
maul their expert findings and, as in the
case of their chemicals industry report,
leave them on one side for indefinitely
prolonged contemplation while the in-
dustry concerned cooks in uncertainty
of its tariff fate.
Dozing through the long recitals of
written evidence one has plenty of time
to ponder such questions as what wohld
happen if the decisions of the Arbitration
Commission were subject to the same
political scrutiny before becoming part
of the economic scheme of things. Pre-
sumably if the last two wages increases
awarded by the Commission had had to
run the political gauntlet before being
implemented, they, on the showing of the
Government’s interventions in the tv/o
cases, would have been negatived in the
interests of containing demand and costj
pressures in the system. But, given an'
ALP Minister at the Department off
Trade, obviously we might well have haa
the latest minority judgment and not the!
majority one put into effect.
Everything in this Heath Robinson!
approach to economic scheming is!
relative to the institutions and their ways
of viewing things evolved or handed
down over the years. Nobody is going]
to make the Arbitration Commission a/
tool of the Department of Labor over-
night, nor, if you like, take the Tariff
Board out of the Department of Trade.-*
The best that can be done to improve
things is not so much for the Govern-
ment to contemplate the Vernon Report,
but to look for a better public apprecia-
tion of inconsistencies, even absurdi-
ties, in the hope of getting the briefs we
give to those bodies, whose verdicts bear J
on the same industrial scene, better co-f
ordinated. One hardly needs to explain,
here the inter-relation between the tariff ]
and the level of wages, nor the bearing |
of both on the pattern and pace of
economic activity.
While I am not saying that, like the
Tariff Board, the Arbitration Commit

vsjon should move its headquarters to
'Canberra, it could well be that in the
interests of rationalisation of our
economic arrangements or, if you like,
[better economic planning as predicated
in the Vernon Report, we will eventually
[have to accept the fact that the deter-
f'nination of wages, as with the determina-
ion of the level of protection, cannot be
tonsidered in isolation from the general
conditioning of economic activity and
Jlirection. To some people this will have
fie sinister implication of introducing a
(political connection into wages deter-
mination; with political decisions already
pervading so much of our economic life
ibis is probably not such a shocking
thought as it may sound.
Perhaps because they have sought to
get the best of both Arbitration Com-
mission and open market worlds for wage
earners, the idea of having the same sort
J|)f processes involving Government for
'determining wages as we now have for
fixing the level of protection has never
bad much appeal to the trade unions.
Although Mr Albert Monk is still affirm-
ing the ACTU’s faith in the Arbitration
’ommission, the trade unions have
<isually seen the alternative as direct
>argaining.
In view of the employers’ drive to get
a total wage and their at least half-way
success in doing this in the 1965 wages
; ase (the single determination for basic
wage and margins), the ACTU surely
Jnust now review its whole attitude to
[the question of involving Government,
fins is because a total wage doesn’t
Make sense except in the context of
having a general incomes policy, some-
thing which is beyond the scope of the
Arbitration Commission and would have
i & be decided and implemented by Gov-
er nment.
In pushing ahead rather blindly with
the total wage claim it has always seemed
to me the employers have been leading
themselves towards a position where
logically they would have to accept a
general incomes policy— not that any-
body would possibly expect the present
Government to venture towards such an
objective which could only result in a
massive redistribution of incomes in this
country. This, of course, is the answer
a new Tasmanian Senator, D. M. Devitt,
was seeking in his maiden speech which
I listened to in Canberra last week. He
professed himself puzzled why the level
of wages should be set by the Arbitration
Commission for the mass of the people
while the incomes of a minority of the
community were left unregulated.
Like Donald Horne’s musings on the
ABC last week on the virtues of estab-
lishing a republic, one can only specu-
late that we seem to be at a crossroads
in wages determination. Political con-
siderations apart, it would seem that the
road could profitably turn more towards
Tariff Board methods, which result in
detailed industry inquiries into costs,
profit margins and so on, and away from
present Arbitration Commission ones,
which in the cases I’ve heard invite only
broad and imprecise argument and
usually give invidious results.


Tightened Control in Russia
The economy recentralised
By GERALD SEGAL
pAU I lOX in both domestic and foreign affairs, accompanied by a conservative anti-
liberal trend, seems to be the mark of Soviet policy as it emerges from the recent
Central Committee and Supreme Soviet meetings.
The reorganisation of the economy,
to which the meetings were mainly
devoted, involves a tightening up of
centralised State control and discipline.
The profit motive as it will be employed
differs fundamentally from its applica-
tion in Western industrialised countries.
There is no question of a young Soviet
factory director freely exploiting some
newly devised technique in the interest
of producing greater wealth for the
country and higher material rewards for
himself. On the contrary, new techniques
and their introduction will be the re-
sponsibility of one of the 21 industrial
branch Ministries located in Moscow.
The factory director is a servant of such
a Ministry and will be required to work
to profit margins prescribed by his
superiors.
The tightening up of the State Mini-
sterial system is also matched by a
marked reassertion of direct Communist
Party control. L. I. Brezhnev, the Com-
munist Party First Secretary, emphasised
in his speech to the plenum that the new
arrangements depended for their success
upon the most intense activity of the
Communist Party network. Thus he
called upon the party groups in the new
Ministries to submit regular reports on
the functioning of the latter, directly to
the Central Committee. This, in effect,
serves notice upon the new Ministers
and their staffs that their activities are
subject to the direct scrutiny of the
party. Moreover, the secretary of the
Moscow City Communist Party has
written in “Pravda” of the special re-
sponsibility of his own organisation for
the appointments to the departments of
the new Ministries. This means that the
party is not only exercising a supervisory
role through its own network, but is
directly making itself responsible for
appointments.
Perhaps more meaningful is the threat
to the balance of power which has existed
in the Soviet leadership since Khrush-
chev’s time. This has been symbolised by
the separation of the State Ministerial
authority, headed by Kosygin occupying
the position of Chairman of the Council
of Ministers, and Brezhnev, head of the
party organisation. Khrushchev wielded
supreme power precisely because he was
both Chairman and First Secretary a
dual position which had been previously
occupied by Stalin. The dangers of
dictatorship implicit in this were publicly
recognised in the Soviet Union after
Stalin’s death and the promise was made
but not kept (by Khrushchev) that no one
man in the future would occupy both
positions. We now find Brezhnev follow,
ing in Khrushchev’s path. First he
strengthened his control over the Com-
munist Party as such by assuming the
chairmanship of its Russian Bureau, a
position which had been left in abeyance
after Khrushchev’s fall. This gives him
direct control of the levers of power in
the largest and most important republic
of the Union. Then he was made a mem-
ber of the Praesidium of the Supreme
Soviet, which constitutes a move into
the State apparatus and therefore partly
whittles away the separation of State and
Party. In 1954 Khrushchev made the
same move.
One may note, too, that, unlike the
position in 1957 when Khrushchev re-
organised the economy, no attempt was
made this year to hold a public discussion
of any kind about the return to the
Ministerial system. Not that democracy,
or at any rate the word, was entirely
neglected. On the contrary, it was argued
that the new planning and management:
system provided for the combination of |
centralised control with what is called j
democratic centralism. This means that 1 ;
when it comes to establishing the factory,
plans, the party and trade-union groups!
in the enterprises will organise meetings
encouraging the workers to raise produc-
tion; this will be held up as an example
of workers’ participation in the running
of the economy, as distinct from what is
alleged to happen in the capitalist states.
But this is an old story and will deceive
no one in the Soviet Union.
Earlier this year, however, a different
trend was discernible. It seemed that the
concept of the “State of the Whole
People”, with its implication of true i
social democracy, which had been writtenf
into the Communist Party programme of[
1961 and attacked by the Chinese
(rightly) as revisionism, would be ap-
plied in Soviet political life. If so, new
horizons would have opened up not only *
for the Soviet people but also for the
entire world, as it would have changed
the nature of the East-West problem.
It was within this environment that
the proposal for multi-candidate elections
to the Supreme Soviet was put forward
in March of this year by a leading legal'
authority. Elections to the Supreme
Soviet are controlled by the Communist
Party and the people have the right only
to vote or not to vote for the single can-
didate put forward; it was an assembly
so elected which took the decision to |
accept the proposals for the economic-
reorganisation last month.
The proposal for multi-candidate elec-
tic ns would at least have been a begin-
ning towards the right of choice and the
discussion in the localities of the suit-
ability of those who sit in the supreme
legislature, although it does not by itself
involve the existence of more than one

party. However, the issue of a multi-
party State was also raised, although
obliquely, at about the same time. On
February 4 there was published :n
“Pravda” an article by a political scientist
named A. Veber on “Communists and
Social-Democrats”, which was a bid to
establish some kind of alliance between
the Communist movement and the social
democratic parties of the Western in-
dustrialised States. After admitting the
mistakes of pre-war Communist policy
in this connection, Veber went on to list
the conclusions drawn by the Com-
munists in their endeavor to understand
the problems of unity of the working-
class movement. They recognised “the
growing diversity of the forms for the
transition to socialism from capitalism,
the struggle for democracy as an integral
part of the struggle for socialism, the
role of profound democratic reforms and
transformations for the movement to
socialism in the developed capitalist
countries, the maintenance of the multi-
party State, and the guaranteeing of
democratic legality”
A ll these points in fact queried almost
all the basic ideological policies of the
various Soviet Governments since the
revolution and could serve as suggestions
for the future reform in the USSR.
“Pravda’s” editor, Aleksei Rumyant-
sev, explored a similar problem in his
newspaper on February 21, in which he
sought to define the relationship between
the Communist Party and the Soviet
intelligentsia a word which covers
scientists, engineers, writers and artists.
He argued that in the conditions of the
“State of the Whole People” the party
did not require any special policy to-,
wards the intelligentsia, for indeed the
party had itself become a party of the
whole people. This represented -a distinct
liberal trend because it meant that the
party would not in the name of the
proletariat enforce views and positions
on the intelligentsia as in the past, when
the biologists were forced to accept
Lysenko’s genetics theories, various
periodicals were shut down, and writers
and musicians attacked on the grounds
that their work did not accord with the
party spirit and meet the requirements
of socialist realism.
Indeed, Rumyantsev went so far as to
suggest that the most general criterion
for artistic creative work—and this, he
argued, followed from the very purpose
and meaning of building Communism—
was the “all-round free development of
the personality of each member of
society.”
If a writer or any man is to develop
his personality as he sees fit, then the
way is truly open to a free, democratic
society in the Western sense. But could
the Communist Party dare permit this
in reality?
The test was soon to come. On Sep-
tember 9, Rumyantsev returned once
more to the theme of the party and the
writer in an article in which he also
attacked certain other Soviet newspapers,
notably “Izvestia”, the second most im-
portant paper in the USSR itself an
unusual procedure. These papers had
criticised a group of writers who, they
alleged, had concentrated, wrongly, on
the worst features of Soviet life and had
thereby distorted the true picture of
Soviet reality. For example, in one story
by Vasily Aksyonov, a money-grubbing,
drunken taxi-driver figured as the hero.
“Izvestia” went on to attack other
avant-garde Soviet writers such as
Yashin, Solzhenitsyn, Bitov, Goryshin.
Rumyantsev, however, defended them
and went on to praise Rozhdestvensky,
Yevtushenko and Voznesensky poets
who had been attacked in Khrushchev’s
ideological campaign of 1962-63. Quot-
ing Lenin, Rumyantsev wrote: “Litera-
ture can least of all be subjected to
mechanical equality, levelling, or to the
domination of the majority over the
minority” and gave his own view that
“genuine party guidance defends the
freedom of the artist in his choice of
theme and subject, style and manner”.
Pursued to its logical conclusion, this can
only mean that the party should become
the guarantor of a free society. That the
party wasn’t ready for that kind of role
became clear a few days later when it
was reported that Rumyantsev had re-
signed the editorship because of a heart
attack.
There are probably many diverse
reasons behind the conservative reaction.
The party bureaucracy would resist the
forces of change: international tension
—Vietnam, China —may have demanded
the avoidance of hasty change. The
development of the American Manned
Orbital Laboratory which will give the
Americans mastery of space, the problem
of a German finger on the nuclear trig-
ger, and a peace settlement in Central
and Eastern Europe, might well have
given the army cause to worry.
Moreover, Brezhnev has admitted (and
it may be noted that the Soviet Govern-
ment has this year already purchased
large quantities of grain abroad) that
the grain procurements from the Soviet
farms will fall short of the plan total.
In the past few years some shortages
have led to riots. Trouble may be ex-
pected and caution must therefore be
the order of the day. Elowever, the
basic diverse trends of the current Soviet
political scene cannot oe reconciled. A
decision must be reached. Caution can-
not always buy time. The 23rd Soviet
Communist Party Congress due, five
months late, in March next year, may
reveal the final outcome.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Wheat and the China Sale
Is there more to come?
Coming a little early (the harvest has not yet started in most wheat areas), the
sale of 500,(100 tons of new season wheat to China pretty well supports the views
expressed here a couple of weeks ago, China needs our wheat and will continue to
need it for as far ahead as anyone can see.
The quantity is a bit disappointing,
but then so is the likely crop. Last season
Australia sold 1,200,000 tons (worth
about £35 million) to China out of a
record 370 million bushel harvest.
No one knows what the harvest will
be this season; estimates range from a
pessimistic 220 million bushels to an
optimistic 300 million. Assuming it will
be 220 million (just to look on the dark
side), it follows that the crop will be
about 33 per cent down. The latest sale
of wheat to China is, on percentage,
about 55 per cent worse than last sea-
son.
The Wheat Board, which negotiated
the sale in Hong Kong, says in its brief
announcement of the sale that this re-
duction has been brought about because
of the anticipated reduction in the 1965-
66 crop. The statement, from the Wheat
Board, is a reduced one also —compared
with those issued last season by the late
Mr J. V. Moroney, then Wheat Board
chairman. There is no mention of ne-
gotiations for further sales once the
harvest is in and the position is clearer.
One would hope that there might be
another sale later on. about April per-
haps, and the lack of more information
could be simply that the Wheat Board
is in the process of shaking down under
its new chairman.
Yet this view will hardly satisfy those
critics of Australian wheat stabilisation
who have predicted that the China market
must always be risky, and that involve-
ment in Vietnam makes it riskier still,
The critics are taking the view that the
reduced sale is a warning by China that
we cannot expect favored treatment in
wheat trading if we continue to support
the US in such adventures as Vietnam. If
this sale is the only one, and if the crop
is closer to 300 million bushels than 220,
then certainly the critics seem to have
a point. Moreover, they can point to
the altogether different sale negotiated
recently by Canada. Potentially (should
China decide to take the maximum) this
could be the biggest China/Canada deal
of all time. Canada, we are told, has
observers only in Vietnam.
A difference is, of course, that the
Canadian crop is in. The Australian one
is not.
Without being too sure, it is this ob-
server’s belief that China has never, in
the past, negotiated a purchase from
Australia so early in the season. As a
matter of fact, your humble observer is
inclined to moan like the Beatles, “what
a difference a day makes”. The Wheat
Board announcement beat our story,
written well in advance, into print by
just two days. Still, it could have been
worse. We were not wrong (as a good
many predictions about wheat are): we
were just a little late.
We now take a bold punt about some-
thing else that is currently going on in
the wheat world. A Wheat Board dele-
gation is at present in Russia. Russia,
this year, needs wheat and has already
bought from Canada, France, and the
US. In the past, Australian sales to Ru s ‘
sia, while healthy, have always been over-
shadowed by the China sales. From

slender gleanings of the state of the
Russian situation, there may be good
reason to believe that a really big sale to
Russia is in the offing.
The whole wheat position is a bit up
in the air due to the uncertainty of the
harvest. In some districts it is worse
than expected; in others a bit better.
It is doubtful, for example, that the
Mallee crop will be anything like 50 per
cent down, as predicted in some quarters
a few weeks back. The oats are now
coming off and they look good, so much
so that feed oats dropped a whole shil-
ling a bushel on the Melbourne Corn
Exchange last week. This is a pretty
healthy drop but it is risky attaching too
much to it, due to the fact that all feed
is encountering strong demand, oats are
“free” whereas wheat is “fixed”, and
barley is partly “free” and partly “fixed”.
Still the oats do seem to be coming
through with few doubts as to quality or
quantity.
The long-range prediction (guess, if
you like) is a wheat crop somewhere
around 250 to 270 million bushels, an-
other sale to China before April, and
a big sale to Russia.
Price? Always important, but not so
important as it could be to the Australian
wheatgrower, because the taxpayer
weighs in where required. The Wheat
Board never reveals exact prices. In
pretty rough terms, the latest sale to
China has been negotiated at about £3
a ton cheaper than the sale last season.
It will mean a few extra shillings, no
more, in tax for the individual Aus-
tralian and we should be able to afford
that.
The joke, if it is one, is that the United
States has no qualms about selling wheat
to Russia; the US Government, is, in
fact, under pressure from US wheat-
growers to encourage Russian buying.
The US cannot undersell us fairly and
squarely; it can undersell any wheat pro-
ducer through its ability to pump billions
of dollars into the farm subsidy and sup-
port programme.
If we do not get a big Russian con-
tract it will be, most likely, because the
US increases its already substantial sales
to Russia from her abundant 1965 crop.
One wonders what has happened to
the Kennedy Round. Is it as dead as
the man it was named after? One knows
there is common cause with the United
States at the conference table (and in
the Vietnam jungle). Somehow, though,
the talks go on and on and nothing seems
to happen. We keep on shaving the price
of wheat, in order to make sales; the
tariff on Australian wool going to the US
is still a barrier although more wool is
going there, and it looks as if the meat
freights to the US will increase after
January.

How to Beat an Export Ban
Has Peking done it with merinos?
PEKING is now claiming that a new breed of fine-wool sheep rivalling the best
Australian merinos has been developed in Sinkiang.
Pictures of these sheep have been
appearing in the official Chinese propa-
ganda magazines. One is inclined to
think that they may well be Australian
merinos.
We have the merino export ban, but
there are many ways this can be over-
come. Whatever may be said about the
ban, and its political aspects, one thing
is sure it does not, and cannot, work.
Merinos have been exported in the
past in defiance of the ban. They will
continue to be shipped out of the country.
It would take a police force of enormous
size, and James Bond ingenuity, to
prevent merinos getting out of Australia.
All that the ban can prevent is the
public sale of merino rams to identifiable
overseas buyers.
So instead cf merino sales being above-
board, with studs and specific blood-lines
obtaining deserved recognition and with
ram sales attracting world-wide attention,
w'e have this underhand method of ship-
ping merinos out of the country. Pedi-
grees would not go with them, but Red
China, for example, would not care one
iota about the names or numbers of the
sheep.
Certainly these sales would be negoti-
ated by middlemen. No Australian stud-
master, regardless of his personal
thoughts about the ban, could run the
risk of selling sheep directly to an over-
seas buyer.
Nevertheless, sheep can easily be
bought. Any Australian property owner,
in fact anyone at all, can attend a ram
sale and buy what ne likes, as long as
he pays the price It is easier still to buy
good flock rams which, for Chinese
purposes, -would serve nearly as well as
stud rams. Flock rams can be bought
any day of the week.
How to get them overseas, to China
for instance? It is not so difficult. Corrie-
dales can be exported freely: if a shipper
were to slip a couple of merinos in a
mob of corriedales going somewhere
overseas, it would take a pretty good
sheep man to pick them out on the
wharf. Officials (veterinary, Customs,
etc.) on the w'harf would not be on the
lookout for the “ring-ins”, anyway.
In full wool, and show condition, the
breed differences are highlighted. In off-
shears condition, say, and around 12
months old, a merino could pass, to
uninitiated eyes, for a corriedale and
vice versa. It would have to be admitted
that this method would contain certain
risks. There would always be the chance
of someone picking out the sheep. The
shipper then would have some explaining
to do.
There is another method which is cer-
tainly possible and which would defy the
closest sc r utiny. This involves a veterin-
ary operation on corriedale ewes, or ewes
of any sheep breed. In the early stages
of pregnancy the ewe’s own fertile egg
is removed and replaced with that from
a merino. The ewe finally gives birth
not to her own lamb, but to a lamb which
has been artificially implanted in embryo.
If this sounds far-fetched, one can
easily enough check with veterinarians
in Australia. The general answer is that,
while no one knows of anyone doing
this sort of thing, it definitely is possible
and, given the right equipment, it is not
a particularly difficult operation. Using
this method it would be quite possible to
get really top-class merino blood to an-
other country.
Of course no one knows if this has
actually been done. Moreover, it would
be a pretty dangerous accusation to make
against anyone in particular. The best
way to regard it, perhaps, is as some-
thing which could be done and to leave
it at that.
The Peking report about the new
sheep says that they graze in open
pastures throughout the year and that

they are producing 60 to 64 count yarn,
used to make fine woollen fabrics includ-
ing gabardines and serges. This, assuming
it is true, supports the view that they are
Australian merinos and not a locally
developed breed or graded-up corriedales.
The wool yield is said to be not less
than 11 kilograms per sheep each year
and sometimes as much as 15 kilograms.
There are two ways of looking at this.
One way is to regard it as a thing which
is bad for Australia. The other way is
to question the wisdom of the merino
ban and to wonder how much better it
would be if stud ram sales were held here
every year, quite openly, with buyers
from all parts of the world.
A thriving merino export industry
would undoubtedly be built up and many
would benefit besides the actual sellers of
the sheep. We might have, for example,
merino ram sales similar to the Perth
bull sales in Scotland.
AGRISEARCH
Soursob Control
Oouth Australian cereal croppers have
for long been contending with sour-
sob (oxalis pes-caprae). West Australian
farmers, especially in the Avon and Swan
Valleys and in the dairying districts of
the Squth-west, have become more aware
of the dangers and disadvantages of this
weed in recent years. Now the Victorian
Lands Department, alarmed by its spread
in the Wimmera and northern wheat
districts, has proclaimed soursob a
noxious weed throughout the State. The
plant also occurs in New South Wales. It
appears to have been brought to South
Australia, probably from South Africa,
as an ornamental about a hundred years
ago. Soursob is of major importance in
the Cape Province of South Africa and it
is also widespread around the Mediter-
ranean. Its flowers are large and colored
a bright sulphur yellow, with orange
spots on the sepals.
Fortunately, a means of controlling
it has at last been devised. The new
control technique depends on a two-
pronged attack: carefully timed cultiva-
tion backed up by a herbicidal spraying
with 2. 4, 5-TP. The weed has a vulner-
able point in its life-cycle, it is when the
food reserves of the bulb are exhausted
and new bulbs have not commenced to
form. In South Australia this stage is
reached between the 39th and 53rd day
after germination. It is indicated by the
appearance, sometime in late May to
mid June, of occasional flowers on the
more advanced plants. This is the time
to hit hard with a thorough cultivation
cross-working is advisable. A follow-
up cultivation in late July or early August
is recommended because by this time re-
generation from broken rhizomes and
crowns is complete, but new bulbs have
not yet begun to form. The 2,4, 5-TP

A crop can be sown about a month
after the herbicidal spraying. In the long-
term, the effort should be well repaid
because apart from interfering with
cropping and lowering pasture producti-

sible for many previously undiagnosed
deaths among livestock. Also, oxalic acid
poisoning in non-fatal intakes diminishes
growth and milk production.

in greater or lesser degree, contain dis-
tinct recommendations of action or of
principle.
Considerable attention should be
given to the Latec report, compiled by
a very able accounting team, Messrs
R. A. Irish, P. L. Crosthwaite and K. 0,
Humphreys.
Two issues which have frequently
engaged The Bulletin, the respon-
sibilities of company directors and of
auditors, come well to the fore. It can-
not be said that the latest shadow over
the company scene, the MLC-H. G.
Palmer imbroglio, has minimised the
need for acceptance of greater respon-
sibility by the two above-mentioned
parties. And the superficially attractive
exercise of “apathy” should not be
allowed to excuse countless sins of
omission, past and current.
Mr Irish and his fellow investigators
tend to be somewhat negatively cautious
in describing the duties of directors and
the range of detailed knowledge of a
company's affairs which might be ex-
pected from them. Emotional reactions
and demands for radical legal changes
are properly decried. Yet there must
be a sneaking suspicion among many
connected with business that a lot of
directors could know more about what’s
going on in their companies and should
not be the last to learn the truth, or
otherwise, of rumor and criticism.
More than what is commonly accepted
as standard might healthily apply to “the
duty of directors to tell shareholders the
necessary facts about the business with
truth and frankness”. The monolithic
silence surrounding MLC-Palmer is dis-
tressful and shocking.
Lopping Dead Limbs
As was expected, the mammoth task of
lopping the dead limbs off the over-
borrowed Cox Bros tree is proving
tougher in practice than in theory. Share-
holders have taken heart over the result
for the latest year group losses were
reduced from £1,960,000 to £330,000 in
round figures. However, the benefits of
this news have been offset to a large
extent by the provision of another
£1,260,000 for losses on the sale of
assets.
This is a substantial increase on the
£1,940,000 originally provided against
losses on the sale of stores, etc., destined
to be sold off in the interests of re-
organisation. In all, the directors are
hoping to sell off £7,400,000 worth of
assets considered redundant to the profits-
liquidity cause. They say considerable
progress has been made on the pro-
gramme but losses and costs have proved
to be greater than originally estimated.

actually produced a profit of some
£825,000 compared with the previous
loss of £317,000. It was mainly the huge
interest bill of £1,129,000 which crippled
the net result and took the year into the
red. The interest bill was £1,634,000 in
the previous year but, even if it had not
been reduced, a trading profit around the
£300,000 would still have resulted for
1964-65. Among other things, such as
substantially higher profits from Georges
(of Collins Street), the profit was a result
of a lift in turnover from £21,562,000
to £21,743.000 by those sections of the
group which are continuing business.
During the year the company repaid
deposits, debentures and mortgages to
the tune of £7,874,000. Over the past
two years it (plus Cox Finance) has had
more than £l3 million to repay outstand-
ings—£8,700,000 from assets reductions
and £4.500.000 from outside borrowings.
All these figures illustrate progress, but
further losses on the sale of assets are
proving real thorns in the side. As direc-
tors admit, the problem of adjusting a
business doing £3O-million turnover a
year to one doing £2O million is im-
mensely difficult One can’t help adding
that the huge borrowings and interest
bills will make reasonable profits im-
mensely difficult to earn also.
Optimistic Pioneer
I)ioneer Concrete Services Ltd has
not been affected by the downturn
in Australian building activity and
evidently is expecting another good year
because of rising profits from overseas
subsidiaries.
The company is particularly happy
with the growth of its overseas sub-
sidiaries, especially in Italy, Mr T. V.
Antico told a Press conference on his
return to Svdney last week after a tour
of subsidiaries in Europe and the UK.
The percentage of income from over-
seas operations now represented about
25 p.c. to 30 p.c. of Pioneer’s earnings,
depending on taxation provisions. For
example, some companies might not re-
quire tax provision if they had had a
loss in the previous year.
There were no tax losses in the Rio-
Pioneer venture, Mr Antico said, and
this venture, which is developing the
Oxford Falls blue metal deposit, should
prove an interesting exercise on 'costs.
The deposit at Oxford Falls is relatively
deep, at 300 to 400 feet, and the method
of extraction could be by a large glory-
hole method delving downwards rather
than the traditional open-cut method.
Mr Antico said the Italian subsidiary,
operated with Cementir of Italy, was a
70 p.c. shareholding by Pioneer and 30
p.c. by Cementir. Depending on certain

Help! Help!
HPhe chairman of Dalgety and New
Zealand Loan Ltd (Lt-Col C. P.
Dawnay) describes Britain’s Finance Act
as a disastrous policy for Britain and
the Commonwealth. It will have a par-
ticularly serious effect on Dalgety, he
said.
The legislation will penalise UK com-
panies which expand overseas business.
The net effect will be to severely reduce
profit retentions.
Echoing the cry for Government help
made recently by its major competitor
in this country, Elder Smith Goldsbrough
Mort Ltd, the Dalgety chairman said it
was uneconomic for brokers and stock
companies to continue to provide long-
term finance for clients, if the companies
had to raise these funds by loan or share
capital.
Dalgety’s advances to clients rose over
the June year from £30.3m. to £34.4m.
They were meant to be short-term loans
to pastoralists, tiding them over the gap
between production and marketing. But
they become long-term credit for agri-
cultural and pastoral development.
In Australia primary producers need
Government loans to relieve drought
hardship, for development work, and for
restocking after the drought, it was
claimed.
Dalgety sales dropped 3 p.c. to
£328.8m. in 1964-65. They comprised
livestock and land sales 42.7 p.c., wool
26.7 p.c., retailing 11.9 p.c., produce
10.8 p.c., wholesaling 6.3 p.c., insurance
1.1 p.c., shipping, travel and stevedor-
ing 0.5 p.c. Income was derived 60.5
p.c. from Australia, 29.9 p.c. from New
Zealand, 5.0 p.c from East Africa and
4.6 p.c. from the UK.

company, Mr Gluth and the daily Press
have made no statement or explanation
as to the move. Something could have
been expected from one of these sources,
especially as the whole business is made
odder by the fact that Yarra Falls has
been making losses lately.
Mr Gluth’s re-election was proposed
by two directors and opposed by three.
One of these was Mr H. W. Hattersley,
who had only just been elected an addi-
tional director. One fails to see the
reasons for his election as his connections
with the textile industry are hardly
strong. Quite apart from all this, Mr
Gluth’s expulsion made it quite obvious
that there is a split on the board. What
it is about remains unknown but, at the
very least, his proposal and opposition
by different directors shows that it is
over the value of Mr Gluth to the group.
The facts also point to the mounting of
a campaign against Mr Gluth. Share-
holders,'normally an apathetic lot in such
matters, voted 15 to 7 against his re-
appointment. The day before the meeting,
Mr Gluth was informed that sufficient
proxies were held to prevent his re-
appointment. His only comment so far
is that he has tried to do his best for the
company. The Bulletin extends an
invitation to someone, especially Mr
Gluth, to make some comment in these
columns, mainly in the interests of share-
holders.
Their lot is not a happy one. Although
the company traded profitably in the Sep-
tember quarter it is still in need of tight,
top-class board control. This will be
hard to achieve if there is a split of some
sort. Moreover, the chairman, Sir
Norman Robinson, is retiring, so a uni-
fying influence will be lost.
Outliving Us All
JJ'he chairman of Mt Isa Mines Ltd
(Mr G. R. Fisher) declined to be
specific about the life of the lead-zinc-
copper mine but hazarded that it
would outlive any shareholders present at
the annual meeting, or their children.
Since the 71 months’ strike which
ended on April 8, the company had not
exported any copper. It is satisfying the
local market first.
Prospects that higher copper prices,
benefiting Mt Isa, would result from any
Rhodesian blockade of Zambian copper
from world markets were dampened by
the thought that any increases on the
present high price on the London Metal
Exchange could lead to substitution by
other metals.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
The Biggest Brewer in NSW
Tooth' s expected bonus fully discounted
The beer “market” in New South Wales
is shared today by three companies,
flail of which are listed on the Exchange.
|The smallest has other substantial in-
terests in coal and shipping; I doubt
/whether it is appropriate to treat R. W.
Miller Holdings as a brewery company
for the purpose of this series of articles.
In any event, it seems that Miller’s share
i 0 f the New South Wales market is not
/very high. So little harm will be done
I by excluding this one company in Aus-
! tralia where brewing and hotels are not
the sole activity of any consequence.
j| There can be no doubt that Tooth and
Co. Ltd is by far the largest brewing
in New South Wales. The only
[ speculation that arises is on the actual
kshare of the market. Some put this
[ share as high as 70 p.c. and others
i suggest that it could be below 60 p.c.
i There seems little doubt that at least 50
'p.c. in number of the hotels in New
i South Wales are “tied” to Tooth, one
fway or another. It is likely that these
hotels could account for more than 60
p.c. of beer sold in all the New South
Wales hotels. The main difficulty is to
assess the situation so far as the licensed
■ clubs are concerned. All three of the
local brewers actively seek the clubs’
trade and it would appear that the larger
deal with at least two out of the
I three.
b Nevertheless, Tooth continues to de-
I velop its hotel interests. The 1965 annual
report contains the following laconic
statement: “As usual, we have assisted
private owners who have been called
<upon by the Licensing Courts to spend
f large sums on their hotels.”
During 1963-64 it would seem that
I fL888,795 was spent on additions to
: “breweries and freehold properties” and
I “plant, machinery and motor vehicles”.
1964-65 £1,112,731 was so spent.
-«It would be interesting to know how
was spent on hotels, and how much
| on breweries and their equipment. It
I would also be interesting to know what
j sort of return is received from hotels in
l| the form of rentals. Over the last three
years £4.35 million has been spent by
5 the company on the items mentioned
above; in the last two years net trading
profit before tax and depreciation has
increased by just under £900.000. If
we assumed that the expenditure in-
curred during 1962-63 and 1963-64 pro-
duced the increase in profit of 1963-64
jand 1964-65, the return on this invest-
ment would have been very high at 27.7
p.c. Unfortunately, we do not know
what sort of increase would have
occurred naturally without the further
expenditure. It is also quite likely that
the company itself would have some dif-
ficulty in isolating the actual increase
in profit which arose from the expendi-
ture on various items. Nevertheless, it
would be interesting to have some break-
down of the profits into brewing profits
and profits from hotel rentals. The
success of the clubs and the substantial
switch that has taken place in the sales
of beer from the hotels to the clubs
would indicate that the brewers can
manage quite well without “tied” houses.
Perhaps the vast sums that are already
invested in this item and the substantial
sums that are still being invested might
be returned to the shareholders.
the new Companies Act of 1961
" enforced greater disclosure (to the
delight of the crystal ball-gazers who were
proved right on this occasion), the
general format of Tooth’s annual report
has not changed. Shareholders are still
informed that “the sum of £1,083,374
7s. 7d. was written off during the year
. . However, the shillings and pence
are now omitted from the figures appear-
ing in the balance sheet and are con-
fined to the figures quoted in the direc-
tors’ report. It is very doubtful whether
we shall see the sort of disclosure which
is becoming more common, and whereby
one feels that a better understanding of
the sources of profitability is obtained,
in Tooth's annual reports for some time
yet. Until the year ended March 31,
1963, the annual tax provision was not
disclosed, so we only know the pre-tax
profits for the last three years. On the
face of it, the provision for depreciation
seems to be rather high. Of the total of
£1,083,374 provided for depreciation
during 1964-65, £207,713 was to write
down the value of “breweries and free-
hold properties” and £875,661 was to
write down plant, machinery and motor
vehicles which would have had a book
value before the 1964-65 depreciation
charge of £5,193,225, that is, about 17
p.c. was written off the depreciated value.
If we assume that the tax provision
is correct, and it does seem that the
amount transferred out of the provision
during 1964-65 corresponds with the
amount charged against profits (after
adjustment for the under-provision in
respect of the increase of 6d. in the £)
in the 1963-64 year, then the taxable in-
come for 1963-64 would seem to be of
the order of £4,850,000. As this amount
exceeds disclosed pretax profit by
£817,000 approximately and the de-
preciation charge for that year was
£993,577, it is unlikely that the dis-
crepancy can be attributed entirely to
excessive depreciation.
We are then left with the thought that
the earning rate for 1964-65 might have
been near to 281 p.c. and this would
mean that, at current prices of around
995., the earnings yield is 5.8 p.c. If
Castlemaine Perkins’ earning rate was
worked out in the same way, the earn-
ings yield for that company’s shares,
at a price of 605., would be 6.7 p.c. What
then is the attraction in Tooth’s shares at
995.? It can hardly be the dividend
growth rate, because over the last seven
years or so this would not have exceeded
4 p.c. per annum and this would not
justify the low yield of 3.1 p.c. We can
only assume that the bonus issue widely
predicted twelve months ago is still ex-
pected. The last issue was on the basis
of one-for-two and was made in Febru-
ary, 1955, after the dividend rate had
been increased to 16 p.c. for the year
ended September 30, 1954. It looks as
though the dividend rate for 1965-66
will be 16 p.c., so the time for the ex-
pected bonus issue should be August,
1966. If everything happens like it Jid
in 1955, shares being purchased now at
995. will show a dividend yield after the
issue of 3£ p.c. The future issue seems
to have been fully discounted at this
price.

ADDRESS
A Year of Fulfilment
Broken Hill South not over-discounted
By ROGER RANDERSON
share market is showing signs of
increasing awareness that 1966 could
be a year of great fulfilment for Broken
Hill South, as plans come to fruition
from a long period of precise planning
involving the transfer of £lom. of
funds into new activities and a protracted
call on the patience of the company’s
shareholders.
Bang on target, the highly mechanised
CSA mine at Cobar should be producing
copper ore at the rate of 650,000 tons
per annum by the middle of next year.
Development to date has not only con-
firmed prospects indicated by extensive
diamond drilling up to 1962, but it has
also brought to light a number of new
ore-bodies containing 6.3 p.c. zinc in the
area between the eastern and western
copper lodes.
Plans for treating this unexpected
Cobar zinc find will no doubt be an-
nounced in the coming year.
Almost £6m. had been spent on
this new project by last June, of which
about £ljm. would have been
contributed by South’s minority partner,
CRA.
Broken Hill South has renewed its
Barrier leases for a further twenty years.
Its reserves of rich ores at Broken Hill
are conservatively stated at 1,020,000
tons. In addition the company possesses
more than 2,500,000 tons of lower-grade
reserves, which must wait on agreement
from the unions before it can be worked
profitably by highly mechanised methods.
With the treatment, which is in pro-
gress, of 80,000 tons of slimes containing
11.4 p.c. zinc in the year ending June
30, 1966, the company has taken its first
step in a long-range plan to extract zinc
from its immense surface dumps. The
£500,000 plant due to commence oper-
ating in the latter half of 1966 will be
able to treat up to 270,000 tons of sur-
face residues each year.
In this way the company will find an
offset to rapidly rising costs of mine
working, which last year rose from £7 9s.
to £9 12s. per ton, and greatly extend
its working-life on the Barrier.
Broken Hill South stated its net profit
at the record figure of £2,379,708 for
the year ended last June 30 (or 38.9 p.c.
on capital of £6,112,500) after providing
£684,172 for depreciation and amortisa-
tion, £1,552,393 for royalties and net in-
come tax, after spending £252,484 on
field exploration, and after providing
£317,687 to write down investments in
prospecting ventures.
If Mr G. R. Fisher (chairman of
Mount Isa Mines Ltd) is correct in ex-
pecting prices of lead, zinc and copper
to remain around their present levels for
the next 12 months, it would not be sur-
prising if the company were to repeat
or exceed this profit performance in the
current year ending June 30, 1966, even
if there were little or no contribution
from the operations at Cobar.
Implicit in this statement is the ex-
pectation that average prices realised for
lead and zinc will be about 10 p.c. lower
in the current year. Although ore to be
mined will be 53,700 tons fewer at
225,000 tons, material to be treated will
increase by 26,300 tons to 305,000 tons
including the low-cost 80,000 tons of
zinc slimes.
A notable feature of last year’s ac-
counts was the doubling of the working
surplus from the E.R. & S. refinery at
Port Kembla (in which Broken Hill South
has a 60 p.c. interest) to almost
£1,500,000. Smelting activities should
make an even larger contribution to the
current year’s results, with rising quanti-
ties of feed now coming from Cobar.
Income from investments should be
higher than last year's figure of about
£689,000, if only because of a higher
dividend from the Broken Hill Associ-
ated Smelters Pty Ltd, from which
Broken Hill South last year received
700,000 bonus shares to increase its 20
p.c. interest in this company’s capital to
£2,000,000.
By now Broken Hill South will prob-
ably have met a final call of £137,396
to give it 4,150,000 fully paid shares in
the capital of Alcoa of Australia Pty
Ltd, representing a 16.6 p.c. interest in
this integrated aluminium industry.
Dividends from this investment have
taken longer to eventuate than was ex-
pected when shareholders subscribed the
one-for-two issue of dividend-deferred
shares at a 50 p.c. premium in 1961-62.
No doubt the reasons for this delay are
that the Kwinana refinery is doubling
its capacity to cope with the annual ex-
port of 200,000 metric tons of alumina
under long-term contract to American
Metal Climax of New York, and that
adequate protection for this important
infant industry has not yet been settled.
However, it seems reasonable to expect
that the Alcoa investment (representing
about a third of the book value of all
investments) will in the next year or
two be adding sufficient dividends to
enable directors to resume the company’s
traditional policy of finding ninepence
(or 15 p.c. of present capital) of Broken

Hill South’s dividend from its invest-
ment portfolio alone.
It is not easy to estimate the effect of
Cobar operations in the year ending June
30, although, on progress to date and
what is expected in the next six months,
I shall not be surprised if they add more
than £2,000,000 to raise the value of
Broken Hill South’s mine production to
almost £9,000,000 in the current year.
Directors have previously indicated
that the working surplus from Cobar in
the year ending June 30, 1966, may be
required to meet capital costs of mine
development. Given the continuance of
copper prices near the producers’ present
level of £A395 per ton (w'hich is far
below the marginal price of £A7OO per
ton for dealings on the London Metal
Exchange), a little arithmetic will show
that Broken Hill South is capable of
doubling its present level of profits in
the following financial year, 1966-67.
Diversification is the key to stable
earnings from mining enterprises and
Broken Hill South (with its range of
interests in lead, silver, zinc and copper
directly, and indirectly in aluminium) is
in process of making itself proof against
substitution problems when an individual
metal reaches prices that are unstable.
The company’s wide range of pros-
pecting activities aims at still further
diversification.
Tin (the world’s as well as Australia’s
most deficient metal) is being sought by
a new subsidiary, Comstaff Pty Ltd, in
which a 10 p.c. interest has been given
to a Canadian company which is per-
fecting a new extraction process for tin.
Comstaff has already proved limited ex-
tensions of mineralisation from 7253 feet
of diamond drilling at Mount Bischoff
(Tasmania), which was once the site of
the world's greatest tin mine.
Petroleum and natural gas are being
sought through a 17k p.c. interest in
Beach Petroleum NL. Broken Hill South
is also seeking phosphate, and testing
asbestos deposits here and in New
Zealand.
Kanmantoo seems to have disappointed
previous hopes for an open-cut opera-
tion, but the company is still proceeding
with diamond drilling to increase ton-
nages of proved reserves, while its active
prospecting in and around Broken Hill
includes continued drilling to prove the
Mutooroo prospect of another copper
mine.
Broken Hill South paid a sixpence
dividend on all its capital last June and
will pay its shareholders a further nine-
pence dividend on December 3, making
Is. 3d. (or 25 p.c.) for the 1964-65 year.
The trend to higher dividend payments
may be confirmed when the company
gives its 1965-66 profit estimate next
April.
Now that Broken Hill South seems to
have an assured life of 30 years or more
from its first mine on the eleven-mile
Cobar copper lode, and many more years
of life at Broken Hill than was formerly
supposed, it is not unnatural that the
share market should begin to discount

considerable prospects in prices for the
ss. stock unit.
It is difficult to estimate prices at
which Broken Hill South’s shares will
be changing hands next year and it
would be unwise for me even to hazard a
guess.
However, we can take a leaf out of
the book of old hands at mining invest-
ment and adopt the following kind of
approach to the problem of valuation.
At recent prices of about 265. 6d. the
24,450,000 stock units of Broken Hill
South are given a valuation of about £32
million, as compared with shareholders’
funds amounting to about £2l million.
From the market valuation it is fair
to deduct at least £i 1,872,000, being the
conservative book-value of the company’s
investments.
The market, therefore, at 265. 6d. is
valuing the company’s mining and smelt-
ing undertakings at about £2O million,
which is 12 times last year’s earnings of
about £1,691,000 after subtracting the
year's investment income. If, as may
be reasonably supposed, mining and
smelting operations yield double the
previous profits in 1966-67, the present
market price represents an expectation
of only six years of the expected level
of earnings in the not-far-distant future,
This does not seem to be an over-
optimistic valuation for a powerful
mining and industrial complex, with great
prospects stretching perhaps to the end
of the century.

Cobar the company would further test
all these positions. It was also possible,
the company continued, that new ore
positions not now evident at the surface
could be disclosed by general prospect-
ing around Cobar. In 1962 the company
reported that 10 holes drilled on the
Chesney orebody had revealed deposits
averaging 2.72 p.c. grade over an aver-
age width of 31 feet.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Rare Case of Solidarity
A . V. Jennings among the builders
Tn the words of the chairman at the
recent annual meeting, A. V. Jen-
nings Industries (Aust.) Ltd has ex-
perienced a period of emergence from .a
medium to a large national corporation
with expanding international connec-
tions. This emergence has primarily been
the result of an extensive policy of pre-
planning undertaken by the group. It has
been geographic to a large extent and,
with all new areas now formally estab-
lished, the group is set for a period
of consolidation and profit growth.
Jennings is a leader in the building in-
dustry. Its operations are spread over
housing and estate activities, general con-
tracting. and the manufacture and supply
of building products. In 1964-65, these
represented 33 p.c., 50 p.c., and 17 p.c.
respectively of total trading. Group
turnover jumped 371 p.c. to £24.3 m.
With the commencement of home
marketing in Sydney, housing operations
now extend to all States except Queens-
land. In Victoria Jennings is by far the
leading home builder. Throughout Aus-
tralia 1808 homes were built, compared
with 1760 in 1963-64, providing £8 m.
of the total turnover. General contrac-
ing worth £l2 m. was completed. Satis-
factory work was obtained in Bris-
bane and NSW, while contracts for Mel-
bourne's Cultural Centre and the Volks-
wagen group’s building programme af-
firmed leadership in Victoria. Manu-
facturing and supply activities (hardware,
timber, aluminium products) provided a
£4 m. record turnover, while firm credit
policies kept bad debts at negligible
levels in a field where such problems are
rife.
The size and range of the corhpany’s
business have grown to the extent where
operations must be segregated into three
groups. As from October 1 last, these
are housing and building products, con-
struction and finance. Financing forms
an integral part of the group, mainly
through Jennings Estate and Finance Ltd.
This firm raises public money through
debentures and deposits for the financing
of Jennings’ customers. Although a sub-
sidiary by virtue of board control, the
Companies Act does not require its ac-
counts to be consolidated. Hence, its
debentures of £1,466,200 and deposits
of £447,583, guaranteed by the parent,
are not included in the balance sheet but
shown as a contingent liability.
A recent move has been the opening of
a London office. This will deal mainly
with the problem of housing British
migrants before they get here and no
doubt will result in many firm agreements
before the migrant even reaches Aus-
tralia. In addition, the office has pro-
vided what could be an important link
with the industry in Europe and a gate-
way to the construction plans of British
firms with Australian subsidiaries.
As the accompanying table shows,
1964-65 profit jumped from £351,000 to
£452,000, to equal 32.1 p.c. on higher
average capital. Dividend was repeated
at 12 p.c.
The balance sheet’s most outstanding
figures are the growth in fixed assets and
the jump in loan capital. To a large
extent, the latter financed the former, as
well as enabling and providing for the
rapid growth of business. A new national
headquarters was completed at Spring-
vale (Vic.) and permanent offices were
bought in Hornsby (NSW). Country saw-
milling plants at Mansfield and Swift’s
Creek (Vic.) were rebuilt and modernised,
while an East Gippsland mill was acquir-
ed to ensure additional long-term logging
supplies. Factory facilities for the joinery
shop and aluminium products were
doubled.
At present, the outlook is for steady
or slightly higher profits in the current
year. In the September quarter, turnover
was £6.7 m. and profits were main-
tained. At September 30, uncompleted
construction activities totalled almost
£lO m. As this article is being writ-
ten, it has been announced that the com-
pany has won a £3.6 m. contract for
the building of the National Art Gallery
in Melbourne’s Cultural Centre.
However, it is dangerous, in fact im-
possible, to predict the full year’s result
from a group which is so intimately con-
nected with the building industry. This
is why the ss. shares of an excellent com-
pany such as Jennings are selling for only
10s. on the market and yielding 6 p.c.

from the dividend. Moreover, the group
is heavily borrowed and any recession
would hit it rather hard, as the uncovered
1960-61 dividend in the table illustrates.
Conversely, sound' administration and
the position of leadership make for quick
recovery when a recession ends, as the
table also illustrates.
It w'ould not be surprising to learn that
the easing in the industry’s rate of growth
this year was a big factor behind f he
directors’ decision to concentrate more
on consolidation than expansion. In this,
they will be aided by the easing in the
strained employment situation. Pro-
fitability in relation to sales (which eased
from 2 p.c. to 1.85 p.c. last year) could
improve if the industry’s slower growth
dampens rising costs. The percentage
will also benefit this year, as 1964-65 had
to bear the establishment costs of opera-
tions in Queensland, NSW and London.
Further efficiencies should result from
the introduction of a permanent com-
puter next March.
The current dividend is the highest
ever paid by the group. The lowest has
been 8 p.c. At the annual meeting a
shareholder urged the board to con-
sider higher dividends. Mr Jennings said
this would be considered, but he pointed
out that the industry was noted for its
ups and downs. To this column, it seems
that his argument was more in support
of the shareholder than himself. Any
shareholder in a building company
expects ups and downs and, in return
for this risk, he expects the dividend to
do exactly the same. Dividend cuts are
not so bitter to take if a high payout
and Jennings could easily have afforded
15 p.c. this year is made in the pros-
perous years.
It would seem that Mr Jennings, being
the extremely responsible businessman
that he is, is more interested in giving
shareholders a steady dividend each year
regardless of ups and downs. This is
evidenced by the uncovered payment of
1960-61. His aim is to be respected; if it
can be achieved, then the group will be
in an enviable position. It is already well
on the way toward this with such a high
earning rate.
Further proof of an apparent aim
toward high earning rates and steady
dividends is the group's definite pre-
ference for loan capital over equity
capital. Following the refinancing of a
£369,000 note issue on November 30,
loan capital as shown in the table will
jump to a level slightly higher than or-
dinary capital. One may argue that the
hole in this approach is the high pre-
ference capital (a further £250,000 worth
was raised last year). However, in this
day and age, preference capital is vir-
tually loan capital as the dividend is
fixed, the shares are often redeemable
and, as with interest bills, the dividend
bill is a deduction from profits as far as
the earning rate is concerned.
All this is not to say that the company
is completely averse to share issues, al-
though there is no likelihood of the one-
for-one bonus advocated by a share-
holder at the meeting. The last issue
was a one-for-four at par in 1963-64.
Prior to that there was a three-for-five
at a premium in 1960-61. Then there is
a space oh almost 10 years back to the
two one-for-two par issues made in 1950-
51 and 1951-52.
The table shows rapid growth in cur-
rent assets and current liabilities, yet
working capital has come out adequate
and better than ever. Fixed assets lagged
in growth for a while but have now
caught up with the general trend.
Intangibles are being slowly written
down, representing goodwill on consoli-
dation. The capital items have already
been discussed, with the exception of
reserves, which complaining shareholders
should note have been built up to more
than the ordinary capital and provide
a solid background to operations.
Net profit, surpluses, etc., show phe-
nomenal growth. Share prices have been
remafkably steady considering the in-
dustry's volatile nature ~and provide
further evidence of the virtues of steady
or slowly rising dividends, rather than
a crash-boom policy which results in
sharp price variations and many burnt
fingers.
To sum up: the shares seem good buy-
ing for the investor seeking reasonable
returns, an interesting investment and
showing the prospectus of short and long
term capital growth. The interest will
be provided by the industry’s fluctuations,
although it is unlikely that the group
could get into any really serious trouble.
It fared excellently during the credit
squeeze when compared with its con-
temporaries. Security is provided against
most fluctuations by the high earning
rate. Asset backing on each ss. share is
10s. market price. Once serious ex-
pansion resumes, a share issue seems
likely.

SPECULATOR'S DIARY
Some Modest Transactions
Not “ marrying” half a million
IT’S been a strange week apart from the weather, I mean. In Sydney our
leading voter of thanks to boards of directors ran true to form at the Kolotex
meeting, and raised a wry smile or two. In Adelaide Dr Lyons and W. R. Grace,
those inseparable lovers, continued that remarkable little “pas de deux” they’ve been
performing in what, after all, is our festival city.
Back in Sydney, someone who con-
siders himself to be a Very Important
Person has been showing a crude dis-
regard for the meaning of the words
“personal and confidential” on correspon-
dence. But I suppose it is a bit naive to
think that those words have any mean-
ing among stockbrokers who put
“private and confidential” on their client
circulars —and promptly mail off copies
to every newspaper in town!
Having got all that off my chest I can
now direct my attention to the market,
which has also had its points of interest.
At least for the stockbroking firm that
“married” half-a-million Pioneer Sugar
shares! Makes me feel I shouldn’t even
mention my own modest transactions.
Elsewhere the new issue mongers have
been routed as one rights issue after an-
other spurts ahead, with Hanimex and
J. B. Young setting the pace. There
have, of course, been one or two
dawdlers like Stocks and Holdings. Now
here’s a property development company
that prefers not to indulge in the bally-
hoo and PR of some of its fallen com-
rades. Instead, it has been quietly going
ahead and earning increased profits. Its
directors are obviously shrewd judges of
the future. Some years ago they were
running up shopping arcades in all sorts
of outback places like Toongabbie,
Merrylands and Blacktown. Since then
these suburbs have been engulfed in the
population bulge which has added hand-
somely to property values in those areas.
Nowadays one doesn’t find Stocks and
Holdings in those places quite so much.
Instead they’re burrowing under Castle-
reagh Street and linking up their smart
new Imperial Arcade building with David
Jones’ Elizabeth Street store. Next on
the drawing boards, I hear, are plans
for linking the Myer-Farmer store at
Miranda with the nearby railway station.
From this it at least seems fair to say
that the directors are no fools.
Yet the market still prices the 5 Si
shares at 12s. 6d. to yield 6 p.c. from a
dividend that has been twice covered by
profits for years. In addition, asset back-
ing has been moving up steadily and
reached 13s. 2d. prior to the current
issue. Despite this the shares have never
been popular, probably because of some
old-fashioned prejudice against the com-
pany’s European-born management. This
didn’t put me off buying 300 old shares
at 12s. 6d. in the hope that at last the
shares might be about to become popular.
Another stock to take my eye this
week was Malleys, which I suddenly
noticed had slid from 355. to 28s. in a
matter of weeks. And all because, one
can only assume, the chairman was
honest enough to say in his annual review
that it would be “unwise to anticipate
progressive increases in either profits or
earning rates of the nature recently
achieved”. Now this doesn’t say profits
will fall, only that they will not continue
to rise at the spectacular rates of recent
years.
This sounds a good deal more realistic
to me than the chairmen who blithely
ignore the omens and continue to view
the future with their customary con-
fidence. It will be interesting next year
to look back at some of the chairmen’s
addresses in the light of the results
actually achieved. There could be a few
red faces that is, if many company
chairmen are still capable of blushing.
Malleys’ chairman, however, should have
no fears despite the fact that the price
of his realism has, as I said, been to
knock 7s. off the market price of Malleys’
shares. They now yield 7 p.c. so I bought
200 at 28s.
For cash there was the credit of £lB5
in my account, plus the proceeds of my
200 Mount Isa which I decided to sell
following Mr Smith's UDI. An ill wind,
they say; but even my hardened
stomach turned a little on the thought
that here am I making money in Aus-
tralia out of Rhodesia’s troubles.

You uuean a white shirt, right ?
But how much cuff do you show?
None at all if you’re like most men. How much should
you show? Exactly half an inch. True, it's not a lot, but
it makes all the difference between just looking
dressed and well-dressed.
That’s why we designed this Smartstay shirt with a
French cuff in three perfect sleeve lengths. The re-
sult? It fits smoothly and reveals just the right amount
of cuff. A half inch measure of your good taste. And
we should add, it’s styled with a continental flair.
The collar? A straight-forward, let’s get down to busi-
ness look when it should. Rather suave and a little
dashing when it shouldn’t. The fabric? An importec
spin-dry cotton for easy laundering. The cost? 49/11
Now it's vour move.
