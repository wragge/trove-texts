Who pulled the Reserve Bank job?
The “haul” included 1,000 desks . . .
2,500 chairs . . . 300 filing cabinets
. . . 40 safes . . . 200 storage units
. . . 700 individual “personnel car-
tons” . . . etc. . . . etc. . . .
ANSWER: Using as many as 70
skilled men ... 18 pantechnicons
a number of armed guards . . . and
all sorts of technical equipment . . .
IN 48 HOURS GRACE BROS. RE-
MOVALS PERFORMED ONE OF THE
BIGGEST OFFICE MOVES IN AUST-
RALIA. GRACE BROS. MOVED THE
RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA!
$400,000 (the bank thinks decimal)
worth of furniture and equipment
moved about three hundred yards.
That's right. Just across the street.
It wasn't easy; Grace Bros. Re-
movals will tell you that. But no
moving job is “easy.” Each job
requires careful thought, planning
and special equipment. If it’s a
reaily BIG job —across the street, or
across the world —call Grace Bros.
The Bank job included moving two
plastic coated “ears of wheat” that
had been used as models for bank
notes! Get the idea? Grace Bros,
don’t specialise in “big” jobs or
“small” jobs. They specialise in
moving! Why did we tell you about
the big job first? Everybody likes
to brag a little.

Australia's Crude Oil!
Mobil has already refined 20 million gallons of it.
Ever since Queensland’s Moonie crude oil was
put into commercial production in August,
1964, Mobil Oil Australia has played its part in
the development of the Australian oil industry,
by purchasing and refining its full quota of the
total output of Moonie oil.
With an investment of more than £BB millions in
Australian refineries, petrochemical complexes,
oil exploration and research, Mobil provides
Australia with a host of quality products for
land, sea and air transport, agriculture, and
industry. Mobil, Australia’s pioneer oil com-
pany, is proud of its contribution to the
Australian economy over the past 70 years.
Mobil will spend more than £3 millions in ex-
tensions to the Altona refinery this year alone!

National Notebook
Stuck
“Vf° w maybe it has got all the earmarks
* of a good story,” said one of Rudy
Komon’s secretaries, playing mother with
the chilled hock in the master’s absence,
“but you are not to mention the words
bull artist. Mr Shepherdson is sensitive.”
I In the carpeted upper reaches of the
Komon Gallery, in Paddington, before
isome of his 20 paintings of stunned,
'dying and dead bullocks, young Queens-
land painter Gordon Shepherdson was
talking shop. A tall young man with
cropped fair hair, looking a little astray
in a dark suit and a tieless white shirt, he
dutifully explained his work to an audi-
ence of politely sipping ladies.
| “In the old days,” he told them, “we
Jused to dong ’em on the head, but now
they’ve got this compressed air gun.
You hit ’em just the same but the bolt
goes into their brains, you see. Doesn’t
take a minute.”
! A woman in elegant glasses thought
pigs had more character. Why didn’t Mr
Shepherdson paint pigs, now?
“Well,” said the artist, digging his toe
reflectively into some lush green car-
pet, “pigs bleed a lot when you stick
them. Not that I haven’t stuck a few
pigs in my time, but I’m on the bullocks
now. I’m a meat lumper, you see. I
shove the quarters on to a conveyor
belt.”
I Mr Shepherdson, an ex-Gatton Col-
lege boy, has been at the abattoirs in
Brisbane for nine years, after an un-
happy bash at jackarooing near Long-
reach and working as a riveter's assist-
ant at Evans Deakins’ shipyards. He
starts at six, finishes three hours later
at nine, and collects, he says, a pony
a week pay.
Doggedly the lady stuck to the sub-
ject of Mr Shepherdson’s wide-eyed,
gentle bullocks. The paintings, deep
blackish-green and red, had titles like
“Heads off”, “Stuck”, “The Astonished
Poddy” and “The Kosher”. Was Kosher
killing more humane? Mr Shepherdson
was not prepared to discuss variations of
pain. “All I know,” he said, “is they slit
’em instead of gunning them. Some rabbi
bloke comes out every Tuesday at 2.15
and says a few words. But what's it mat-
ter? They all know they’re going to
die.”
Another woman felt sure Mr Shep-
herdson must have gone over to vege-
tarianism. “Gee, no,” he replied. “I like
a good steak as much as the next bloke.”
And the best cut? He wouldn’t know.
He was just there to shove them on to
the conveyor belt.
Hung incongruously between the dy-
ing bullocks was a large blue-and-green
painting called “Lovers in the Morning”,
showing the back of a naked girl. It be-
longed, said the artist, to a middle period,
between two bullock phases, and he pre-
ferred the bullocks. But there would be
no more bullocks for a while, because
he was working on a new series about
musicians.
How ‘ did he think his abattoir bulls
compared with the Hemingway-type
bull? Did he read Hemingway? “Now
look,” said Mr Shepherdson. “As far as
literature and music goes I’m just an
idiot. The only reason I’m doing these
musicians is that we play cricket against
them every year, artists versus musicians.
So I go along to rehearsals and there’s
something about them when they’re play-
ing music that gets me; they’re sort of
one with the instrument, you know. I’m
picking up a bit of music but I couldn’t
say anything about it.”
Shepherdson began painting about 13
years ago but didn’t do much about it
until six years ago when he took draw-
ing classes and studied with Molvig and
Andrew Sibley, both of whom he ad-
mires. “But I wouldn’t say they’d influ-
ence me. My style is Gordon Shepherd-
son. They’re a lot better painters than-
me, but they don’t paint bullocks, and
they don’t feel the way I feel about
them.”
Shepherdson is married with two sons
and lives at Holland Park. His elder
brothers, a solicitor and a cattle buyer,
went to Churchie, still the only school
for the sons of gentlemen in Brisbane.
“But you wouldn’t catch me going
there,” Mr Shepherdson said. “My
mother thinks it’s quite nice, me being
a painter, but I’m not the sort to get
too excited.”
He was having his first trip to Sydney
but was well accommodated in a motel.
Everything was going like a train. But
he was crooked on the blokes in Mel-
bourne who had messed up some of his
paintings after the exhibition at
George’s.
An elderly gentleman refused to be-
lieve Mr Shepherdson really worked in
the abattoirs. Did he do preliminary
"Now, why don't we stop and think this over."

his time being a meat lumper for a

“I don’t know,” he said. “It’s a good
job, and these bullocks mean something
to me.” He turned to us. “And if you
write anything about me I don’t like
•I’m going to be real crooked on you,
too.”
Three-way Deal
“'T'he British cinema is played out. I
A wouldn’t want to work in Holly-
wood. So obviously Australia is the
answer,” Michael Powell, 60 this Thurs-
day, September 30, told us. “This is a
marvellous city . . . after ‘They’re a
Weird Mob’, written by Emeric Press-
burger and starring Walter Chiari, we’ll
make another picture here, a thriller
using as many natural locations as pos-
sible . . .”
In a way, Powell’s Australian venture
a three-way deal between Rank, the
British Film Finance Corporation, and
J. C. Williamson’s is typical of a
director who has always been prepared
to experiment, to seize on new means
of cinematic expression. And to impro-
vise, to invent: he told us that in his
“49th Parallel” the script had called for
an enemy alert system in Canada, but
when he got there to make the picture
no alert system had been installed. “Any-
one could have invaded the place to-
morrow morning ... so we simply put
an alert system in ourselves.”
In his propaganda picture, “The Lion
Has Wings”, he had simulated a huge
British air force and ground force “when
Britian had nothing”; in “The Thief of
Bagdad” he had made seas rage and
carpets fly and genies rise out of bottles
while war was breaking out and the
turbaned and yashmaked cast had to take
shelter in a coal-bunker; in “Stairway to
Heaven” he had used stop-frame long
before the New Wavelets thought of it,
made eyelids appear to close over the
camera in a subjective - impressionist
operating scene, and in “Gone to Earth”,
“The Elusive Pimpernel” and “The Red
Shoes” daringly experimented with sound-
track, music and color, brilliantly assisted
by his photographer Christopher Challis,
and his art director, Alfred Junge.
“My recent ‘Honeymoon’ ” a ballet
film set in Spain “never got released in
its proper form. It was full of experi-
ments, but the distributors butchered it
mercilessly.” Two more projects a
musical set in Ireland and a version of
Graham Greene’s “The Living Room”—*
had failed to get finance.
How did this great romantic greet the
“new” British film realism? Surely he
wouldn’t like a pretentious piece of
kitchen - sinkism like “This Sporting
Life?” “It was pretentious. But pictures
like that cleared the way for John
Schlesinger, who made ‘A Kind of
Loving’. That was a marvellous picture.
And John worked for me as assistant
director and as an actor. He played 17
parts in ‘Oh! Rosalinda!’ didn’t he,
John?”
Powell was addressing John Pellatt,
associate producer on “They’re a Weird
Mob”, who also worked with him as
assistant director on “Oh! Rosalinda!”
and as an associate on the exciting,
neglected television “Espionage” series,
much of which Powell had directed. In
“Espionage”, Powell had once again dis-
played a formidable inventiveness, and
in “They’re a Weird Mob” though,
smoothly businesslike at conference and
interview, this very striking artist perhaps
preferred not to say so —it was clear
he was going to have a technical field-
day. Only a hint, during a long series
of conversations and the final meeting
with the Press at the Hotel Australia,
Sydney, had been dropped that this
would not simply be a routine realist
picture in the new British tradition.
Anniversary
One of his rare trips across the harbor
from North Sydney, where he
manages an advertising agency, brought
W. Hart-Smith into The Bulletin
office with a batch of new poems.
Hart-Smith remarked that he thought
this marked 25 years’ association with
The Bulletin. However, on consulting
[his diary (if only all writers were as
iwell-organised as poets), he found it was
(only 23. Since then, he said, he has had
|9O poems in The Bulletin, an average,
(he added after a quick calculation, of
tbout 3.90 a year.
Hart-Smith’s “Men Into Trees” will
e published by Angus and Robertson
next year. He regards the years since
|ie returned from New Zealand in 1962
;o live permanently in Australia as the
nost productive in his life. He has two
nore manuscripts ready to hand in. He
s inclined to think that whereas the
writing history of a number of his con-
emporaries is the attaining of a peak
lien a levelling-off, his own seems to
have followed the pattern of a series
pf peaks, of climaxes,
j Hart-Smith’s reputation is as high in
New Zealand as Australia. He does not
iseem to be baffled by a sort of triple
nationality. He was born in England,
bas spent a good part of his life in New
Zealand, but regards himself as Aus-
tralian.
I He feels there may be writing valleys
ahead, but does not doubt there are fur-
Iher peaks. “Too many poets make out
(hat this is a very difficult age in which
>,o be a poet,” he said. “They say that
the climate is not right for poetry. It
sever has been.” Also, he regrets that
poetry is so often regarded as just some-
jhing which precedes other writing
ctivity, a novel, for instance. “Poetry
| my calling, or whatever you want to
it,” he said.
(Hart-Smith said he had never had
treat difficulty in fitting poetry in be-
ween earning a living at tutoring,
oufnalism or advertising. “When I was
Writing ‘Columbus’ I had the manuscript
the desk beside my typewriter,” he
laid. “I did bits of it in the moments
from writing advertising copy for
>meone’s mattresses. You work with
fferent parts of your mind.”
The difficulty today, he felt, was how
to “praise, celebrate, affirm without ap-
pearing naive”. “It is so easy to sing
sick,” he said.
FLOGGING
80 Years Ago: October 10, 1885
the London "Times" of Ist August last
a report is given of an interesting
debate which took place in the House of
Commons on the preceding night. To the
4th clause of the new Criminal Law
Amendment Bill, dealing specially with
offences against children, Mr H. Fowler
proposed an amendment to the effect that
atrocious offences on young girls be
punished, in addition to a term of im-
prisonment, by flogging. Readers of the
Sydney daily Press have not been made
aware of such a debate. We are redden-
ing our hands every week. Every week
we tie some criminal to the triangles. We
draw his blood and cut the flesh from his
bones. Some of us sicken at the spectacle.
More are gratified. Our legislature believes
the entertainment to be good for the
criminal and good for everybody. The
House of Commons condemns the enter-
tainment as being bad for the criminal and
everybody. There are few things the
intelligence of which should have more
importance to the people of New South
Wales than this. The highest deliberative
Assembly in the Empire declares to be
degrading to Englishmen a practice the
New South Wales Government declares to
be suitable to New South Welshmen. Yet
the Press that chronicles the career of a
dead elephant omits mention of this.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Sir Robert and Sir James
In the end Sir James Vernon and
*• his committee may have more to
thank Sir Robert Menzies for than
they would care to admit at present,
la what seems to have-been a case of
“over-reaction”, Sir Robert’s rejection
of many of the report’s ideas and re-
commendations is likely to lead to a
wider public discussion of the basic
; questions, both economic and poli-
tical, than might otherwise have re-
sulted. By rejecting the committee’s
suggestion for the appointment of an
Advisory Council on economic growth
in the terms in which he did, a whole
new debate has started on the ques-
tion of “technocrats v. democrats”
in many ways as important as the dis-
cussion about economic policy. In both
debates the Vernon Report will serve
as a valuable source book, even if, as
some of its staunchest supporters now
: concede, its basic arguments are some-
times invalid. In short it is a mixed
blessing.
For instance, on the question of eco-
nomic planning, it is clear that the
Government is planning all the time
and is heavily laden with economic
advice. The trouble is that such ad-
vice is too departmentalised and lack-
ing in practical experience of the
market place. The Vernon Committee
I gives the opportunity for Canberra to
get a lot closer.
By inviting Sir Robert to scrap the
Government’s present policy of un-
restricted migration and capital inflow,
the Vernon Report was . swimming
( against the present stream of Gov-
• ernment thinking. Yet however re-
luctant the Government would be to
limit immigration and capital inflow
to their present high levels, the Com-
mittee advanced some very cogent
arguments for doing so. Just as forci-
k bly the Government, leaning on its
j “laissez-faire” approach which ad-
mittedly has worked very well while
overseas suns continued to shine on
l us has rejected them out of hand.
This seems unwise, at least in
the case of immigration. Admittedly
industry is scraping the barrel for
labor at the moment. But Sir Colin
I Syme and other industrial leaders ad-
mit to some recession in demand for
their products and last week GMH’s
lay-off could point to a change in the
industrial climate. It would be un-
fortunate if this easing in the demand
i for labor accelerated in the next year
1 when the first of the teenage labor
bulge has to be absorbed into the work
force. At the very least this situation
needs careful watching and the Ver-
non Report does well to remind the
Government of the dangers.
Another example is the committee’s
general view of the next decade of eco-
nomic growth. By 1975 it envisages
balance of payments difficulties arising,
amongst other things, from the build-
up of overseas dividends and interest
remittances on capital inflow if left
unrestricted.
Sir Robert was right in rejecting the
committee’s half-baked arguments and
curious projection on the probable
effects of unrestricted capital inflow.
But he should take note of the corol-
lary for national savings which must
be stepped up to fill any gap in avail-
able capital supplies necessary to
maintain growth at the 5 per cent rate
suggested by the report.
Whatever its deficiencies in the field
of economics the committee was on
much firmer ground when it came to
suggesting an Advisory Council. Sir
Robert’s fears about a technocracy
and the possible coercive powers of a
body not directly responsible to Par-
liament may be reasonable but they
are misplaced. At a time when a great
many public service technocrats can
initiate and execute policy in a manner
growing less and less amenable to
public scrutiny the question of who is
coercive should be asked elsewhere
than that of the proposed Advisory
Council.
For such a Council would be co-
ercive only in the sense that it would
force more issues into the arena of
public discussion. Otherwise it has
no power and the decisions are still
Parliament’s.
As Alan Reid points out on p. 21,
the Canberra technocrats were able to
mount a solid barrage of criticism and
disparagement against the report for
months before its release; a barrage
which suggests that they may have
been at least as concerned with their
own status as they were with defend-
ing Parliament. In any case the
spectre of an anti-democratic group of
technocrats does not seem to have
haunted non-socialist governments in
Britain, Canada and the United States
where similar bodies to those envis-
aged by the Vernon Committee already
exist.
So far the discussion of these im-
portant issues has been limited and
the full version of the report will not
be available to the public until next
year and then at £5 a copy. In the
meantime the Government could con-
tribute to the widest possible discus-
sion of the issues by publishing a
popular edition of the main con-
clusions and arguments.
Saving the Waterfront
most encouraging aspects of the
extremely necessary legislation
proposed by the Minister for Labor
and National Service, Mr VV. Mc-
Mahon, to save the waterfront from
anarchy were the deterrent “teeth” in
the legislation itself and the way it was
accompanied with information.
Such a major piece of industrial
legislation could never be effectively
implemented if it did not have wide-
spread support from public opinion.
There are other “prerequisites” but
Mr McMahon made a start by avoid-
ing vague talk of “Communist in-
fluence” and naming names, describ-
ing Communist Party techniques, and
detailing the past havoc in precise
terms a truly “frightening” decline
in throughput with not one of the re-
ductions in Sydney and Melbourne less
than 11 per cent, and as high as 18.6
per cent, a ratio of unauthorised stop-
pages 27 times as high as in general
industry and accounting for 21 per
cent of all time lost by all workers in in-
dustry. This from less than one per cent
of the country’s workers who, under
Communist leadership, constantly re-
fuse to have anything to do with the in-
dustrial relations committee set up at
their own request, and who have for
so long abused their special privilege
of recruiting their own work force.
Of the other “prerequisites” the
Government needs most of all the sup-
port of the ACTU, or at least its lack
of opposition. For the new interstate
executive of the ACTU this is a major
test which has come close upon the
weakening of Communist influence on
the interstate executive. For President
Albert Monk and his supporters it is
a chance to weaken significantly the
impact of the industrial unrest cam-
paign on which the Communists will
now embark throughout Australian
industry, as well as helping to save a
vital national enterprise.

WATERFRONT
At Last—the Confrontation
The Fitzgibbon test
By JOHN BROCKETT
MR N. DOCKER, WWF industrial officer, and secretary C. H. FITZGIBBON
The Waterside Workers’ Federation
has never been in a worse position to
fight its biggest campaign in a decade
for the reversal of last week’s shock
decision by the Federal Government to
remove the WWF’s right of recruitment
of waterfront labor.
The WWF’s past lawlessness, political
strikes and repeated decisions to act in-
dependently and without consultation,
has placed its officials offside with the
ACTU. Without better than pious de-
clarations of ACTU support or a sus-
tained series of ACTU-backed stoppages,
the WWF cannot hope to force the
Federal Government to relent on its
new policy of confrontation.
The present situation provides a
crucial test for Mr C. H. Fitzgibbon,
Federal secretary of the WWF. Con-
ditions have changed greatly since the
1954 struggle when the Commonwealth
was forced to defer plans to take recruit-
ment away from the WWF. Then the
ACTU was more closely attached to the
Federation, principally because of the
power and influence of wharfies’ leader
the late Mr Jim Healy. But already
doubts are being expressed on the Sydney
waterfront whether Fitzgibbon can
achieve what Healy did.
A precedent which Healy did not
have to worry about, but one that Fitz-
gibbon has to get around, is the decision
of Elliott V. Elliott, Communist boss of
the Seamen's Union who voluntarily last
year gave away the right to provide ships'
crews. Now, if the union does not pro-
vide a crew, the Marine Superintendent, a
Government official, provides them. The
new system has worked satisfactorily.
Federation officials were quick to show
awareness of both the need for and un-
certainty of committed support by the
ACTU. Last Friday, the first working
day after the Commonwealth’s decision
to take recruitment from the Waterside
Workers’ Federation, job delegates on
the Sydney waterfront were summoned
at 9.30 a.m. to the Federation’s office
in Sussex Street. They were told by
branch officials, who had earlier con-
ferred with Federal officers, that a dif-
ficult period lay ahead for the Federa-
tion, and that in no circumstances until
policy was decided should there be any
“spontaneous action”. This unusually
cautious message was relayed to ports
throughout the nation.
Although there was strong talk in
Melbourne and Fremantle and some
grumbling in Sydney, notably from Mr
Ivor Barratt, assistant branch secretary,
who wanted an immediate show of
solidarity, the discipline of the Federa-
tion kept all but one port working. The
exception was Townsville where a 24-
hour walk-off was called before the
official “message” was relayed.
The initial uncertainty of the Federa-
tion did not reflect any sudden change of
heart. Any precipitate action by the
Federation would have exploded any
hope of full-blooded ACTU backing.
Ironically, Mr C. H. Fitzgibbon
THE TROOPS
was responsible for the framing of part of
present ACTU policy which caused the
initial restraint. At the 1963 Congress
he moved for the insertion of four para- 4
Labor...
Though it may come up with a dif-
ferent answer later when Left-wing
pressures have time to exert them-
selves, Labor passed judgment on the
Waterside Workers’ Federation and its
entitlement to ALP support in an in-
direct way in Parliament last week.
It did this when Labor Minister
William McMahon introduced his Bill
which provides for:
# The handing over of the recruit-
ment of waterfront labor from the
WWF to the Australian Stevedoring
Industry Authority.
• Court and other procedures
under which the WWF can wind up
with its registration under the Concilia-
tion and Arbitration Act cancelled; its
rights and privileges under the Steve-
doring Industry Act withdrawn; its
right to represent WWF members
vanished; and any leases it has with the
Commonwealth or the ASIA termina-
ted.
Not only can these things happen.
But the bill also provides for the regis-
tration of a new union or unions if I
the WWF is deregistered, with the new


graphs into the council’s policy on penal
clauses. They read: “The trade union
movement is best served where the
responsibility of individual unions one
to the other is clearly recognised. A
union which requires the support of the
remainder of the trade union movement
has a responsibility not to take strike
action affecting another organisation or
fits members without consulting the
ACTU or its appropriate State branch.
“However, it is also recognised that
exceptional circumstances can involve
a union in strike action for which warn-
ing could not be given. In such cases
immediate steps should be taken to refer
’such a dispute to the ACTU or the
appropriate State branch for endorse-
ment or otherwise.”
The repeated failure of the WWF to
follow that policy is a prime cause of
its industrial ostracism. A meeting late
'in July between ACTU officers and Mr
C. H. Fitzgibbon in Melbourne received
little attention at the time but has now
a crucial importance because it in-
directly resulted in the WWF realigning
itself with the ACTU. Fitzgibbon, who
was seeking the officers’ support for any
measures the Commonwealth might
■ devise to curtail Federation powers, did
lot make any mention of the recently
eached, but not publicly known, decision
for a series of 24-hour national stop-
. pages.
The officers gave Fitzgibbon a
sympathetic hearing, but stressed that
any action must be taken through the
ACTU. Two days later word of the
Federation’s stoppage plans leaked from
Fremantle. Shortly after the WWF was
told bluntly that it would not receive
ACTU backing if it did not in future
follow ACTU policy. After two 24-hour
stoppages without a breakthrough, the
Federation handed its wage and benefit
claims over to the ACTU which controls
them today.
The earlier developments and the new
sureness of the ACTU Interstate Execu-
tive resulting from the recent defeat of
two Communists, Messrs T. Wright and
G. Dawson, and their replacement by
two moderates —Messrs J. B. Holmes
and J. Anderson explain ACTU presi-
dent Albert Monk’s statement that the
ACTU “alone” would determine the
trade union attitude to the Government’s
proposals.
The Government decision .to give
waterside recruitment to the Stevedoring
Industry Authority will not of itself result
in any radical change in the waterfront
workforce. At the present rate of re-
cruitment no significant change could be
expected within five years. However, it
will mean the gradual introduction of
reliable young workers not steeped in
the old wharfies’ traditions, or with a
tendency to blindly follow Communist
leaders.
By ALAN REID
union or unions possessing the powers
the federation now possesses.
Though Opposition members did
not know the details of McMahon's
speech, they had a rough idea of what
\ was in it and so to that extent they
were prepared. If it had been any
union other than the WWF, Labor
members would have been in high
indignation.
There were a few interjections. Noel
Beaton (Lab. Vic.) wanted to know
what crimes were involved was it
riding a bicycle without a lamp?
when McMahon dealt with the high
ratio of men with criminal records
/nominated by the WWF to ASIA for
waterfront employment. Said Mc-
Mahon; “There were men with long
lists of convictions up to the present
1 hnae, of assault with violence, larceny,
thieving and receiving. Some of the
i men whose names were submitted
/Were actually facing criminal charges
(When they were nominated by the
WWF. Two nominees had more than
30 convictions including malicious
wounding, stealing on a number of
occasions, and assault.”
Aside from occasional interjections,
Labor members significantly sat silent.
The interjections there vere came
from people who were not in the Par-
liament in 1949 when the then Labor
administration had to face the kind of
Communist-inspired challenge to the
general welfare of the community that
McMahon declared was now coming
from the Communist - dominated
WWF.
The few older Labor men who still
survive from that era probably had
memories of when the Communist
controllers of the Miners’ Federation
tried to hold the nation to ransom and
the Chifley Labor Government broke
the power of this union. The same
older men undoubtedly also remem-
bered the troubles the Communist-
dominated WWF gave the same
Chifley Labor Government' in 1949
and how the Government was sabo-,
taged on the waterfront.

The Bondi
Stakes
Handicapping Aid
By BRIAN JOHNS
The New South Wales Government’s
honoring of its election pledge by pro-
viding £lOO,OOO for interest subsidies for
independent schools in last week’s State
Budget will pay early dividends.
As Federal ALP policy on State Aid
stands, the NSW Labor Opposition could
be forced into the humiliating position of
applying to Federal ALP authorities for
a ruling as to whether or not it can sup-
port the Budget provision. This is the
result of the Sydney ALP Federal Con-
ference decision that any “new benefits”
on Aid should be referred to Federal
executive for examination.
Whatever the result, NSW Labor
would suffer under Government attacks
of “outside control”. And thanks to the
Askin Government’s coup last week of
getting Labor MLA and former Housing
Minister, Mr A. Landa, to accept the
appointment as NSW Agent-General in
London, Labor could receive swift elec-
toral re-distribution. There will have to
be a by-election for Landa’s seat of
Bondi, held by him at the last election by
only 1600 votes.
The Bondi stakes are high. The NSW
Government has only a floor majority
of one in the Legislative Assembly, and
a victory would give the Government
another chance of winning the next
vacant seat in the Legislative Council,
over which the Government lost control
as a result of the surprise, mysterious
defection in the recent election to fill a
casual vacancy in the Upper House.
NSW Labor has so far adopted a
policy of ‘'watch and wait"’ on the State
Aid dilemma. But the signs are not
hopeful. The Federal Labor Opposition
has not yet decided whether it will have
to vote against an increase in interest
subsidies to independent schools in the
Australian Capital Territory, which the
Federal Government has provided for
in its Budget.
The Victorian Government’s Budget
provision for interest subsidies to inde-
pendent secondary schools —amounting
to £25,000 for 1966—would be a wind-
fall if the Victorian Labor Opposition
took the initiative. However, it is believed
that the Victorian Parliamentary Labor
Party will be instructed to oppose the
Bolte measure.
Victoria is not then likely to let pass
unchallenged any support for Aid by

NSW. The Victorian executive would
welcome any fresh controversy on
Labor’s State Aid policy at this time!
Fresh moves are being made to havij
Federal executive approve investigation
of the Victorian branch over unitjl
tickets, with the investigation being thij
prelude to intervention.
Supporters of the new moves against
Victoria are claiming that they have the
support of South Australia, New South
Wales, Queensland and Tasmania,
leaving Victoria with only the backing of
Western Australia. Those who were bit-
terly disappointed with the performance
of Victoria’s opponents on unity tickets
at the ALP Conference are nevertheless
extremely sceptical.
However, should there be a thrust
against the Victorian ALP executive, the
ruling junta will seek to divide and rule
by laying charges against New South
Wales should it leave itself open on the
aid issue. In this event, Victoria would
have the certain support of South
tralia and, on past record, Queensland
along with Western Australia.
COOK ISLANDS
The Happy
Hula
A piecemeal approach
After a 64-year-old association with)
New Zealand, the Cook Islands are now
self-governing. With a population ol
19,000 scattered over some 850,001
square miles of ocean, the islands ari!
nevertheless not strictly independent!
and the probability is that they never wi|
be.
There has been no desire for a total
break, and in this respect the islander!
may have shown the way for other tiri|
States around the world.
The elections preceding September'!
self-government celebrations were give|
a clean bill of health by United Natioflf
supervisors. It was the first time th|
UN had supervised polling in other that
a trust territory. A 160-page report tej 1
the UN's Special Committee on Colonial*
ism praised the “competence and dedica
tion” of NZ officials conducting thi
elections.
Testimony to the neglect of the Cool
Islands is the fact that Keith Holyoakf
(who danced a hula with a maiden durj
ing the celebrations) was the first Nfi
Prime Minister to visit the territory i|
20 years. The trip was a first one fop
both himself and Leader of the OppL
sition Arnold Nordmeyer.
Immense problems remain if I*l
islands are ever to get on their fef*

permanently for New Zealand). Perhaps
the most gratifying thing about the hand-
over of power, as all observers acknow-
ledge. is that in Mr Albert Henry
the Cook Islands have a Prime Minister
of energy and dedication.
Though New Zealand will continue
its present subsidy of about £5O per
head of population, Prime Minister
iHenry intends approaching the NZ Gov-
ernment for a £150,000 loan to build
[roads, improve water supplies and har-
bors. He hopes that this, along with a
'guaranteed market for agricultural pro-
duce, will eventually lead the islands
away from being a charge on the charity
of the NZ taxpayer. He has even set a
target time, provided he gets the loan:
five years.
Like his counterparts in Western
Samoa (independent of New Zealand
since 1962), Albert Henry is suspicious
of tourism as a way to economic health.
A hasty decision on this could, he says,
place islanders on “the bitter road of
disillusion”. As in Western Samoa,
Tahiti is seen as a grim warning.

Hard Times
“Lucrative pickings ”
It has been a bad year for the legal profession in Sydney despite the splendor
of that recent jamboree, the Commonwealth Legal Conference.
[ The barristers have been harried by
a new Liberal Party Attorney-General,
Mr K. McCaw, far more determined to
clip their fees and prerogatives than their
'old Labor friend, Mr R. R. Downing,
[ever was. But in the spluttering contro-
versy that has dragged on in the letters
[to the newspapers and in Parliament, the
solicitors up until last week were free
from public attack.
By the end of last week it was known
that five solicitors, whose names were
being widely canvassed in Sydney’s legal
world, 'were under investigation by the
Law Society of NSW for alleged mal-
practices relating to payments from
damages cases. This meant that account-
ants deputed by the Society were exam-
lining books and files to check on allega-
tions that some solicitors had not paid to
clients the full amount due to them,
even allowing for expenses,
i A strange industry has grown up in
tpost-war years: industry is the right
■jtyord to apply to the network of con-
tacts, middlemen and solicitors who
ihave lived off the lucrative pickings of
'third party and industrial accident (as
Instinct from workers’ compensation)
leases.
A Lack of funds, fear and ignorance of
ihe law and how to use it among work-
ing class clients, particularly New Aus-
tralians, meant that they were open to
persuasion from a shadowy group of
middlemen to go to such and such a
solicitor who then took on the case, on
, l de facto speculative basis despite
bite rules of the profession against it.
The answer of the Establishment
j solicitors to reports of such practices
been largely ostrich-like. The Law
Society’s own journal not so long ago
sharply rapped a union secretary who
,r a d made a few veiled critical com-
ments.
| There are conflicting reports on how
the current inquiry got under way, but
the most reliable version seems to be that
a dissatisfied client went to that section
of the NSW Government Insurance Of-
fice which handles Supreme Court ac-
tions, last May, to ask just how much
his solicitor received on his behalf from
the GIO.
There was a substantial discrepancy,
and this started the investigation. Some
of the figures being mentioned are hair-
raising. One man is alleged to have been
awarded over £lB,OOO and costs but re-
ceived £4OOO less.
The GIO investigations went on and
at some stage the Bar Council came
into it. First, the President of'the Bar
Council, Mr J..Hoimes, QC, is said to
have spoken to Mr McCaw and then
to the Premier, Mr Askin.
The Bar's initiative has brought some
bitter reaction from the solicitors and
the claim that their brothers are merely
trying to distract attention from the
furore over their own faults. It was the
Bar, apparently, that wanted a NSW
Police Fraud Squad investigation, but
this has been held off to allow the Law
Society to proceed with its own investi-
gation. Under the law as it now stands
the Society has very wide powers to
deal with erring solicitors.
If it is established that clients have
been getting less money than they should
the Law Society could strike off the of-
fending solicitor. But there are two prob-
lems being talked about. First, it may
well prove to be difficult to establish
beyond doubt just what disbursements
were authorised by the complaining
clients. Secondly, there is the problem
of getting money out of any solicitors
involved to repay the complainants.
The allegations involve only a handful
of about 3,000 in the State. But another
small group of solicitors, who question
the present inadequate system of legal
aid, are pointing out that a proper
system of legal aid for the low-income
group who were the main victims of
the rackets would have averted the pres-
ent scandal.
ABORIGINES
On Tribal
Grounds
“ Blacks ’ camps to villages”
Northern Territory pastoralists made
their first offerings to the Ful! Bench of
the Commonwealth Conciliation and
Arbitration Commission when the hear-
ing of the test case for equal pay for
Aborigines resumed in Sydney last week.
The offerings were not extravagant.
But they were positive a welcome
relief in the desperate prospects for
Aborigines hitherto presented to the
Commission by the Sydney Queen’s
Counsel, Mr John Kerr, who is appear-
ing for the pastoralists in the claim by
the North Australian Workers’ Union
for equal pay for Aboriginal station
hands and domestics.
Mr Kerr told the Commission that the
pastoralists were prepared to co-operate
with the Federal Government in the
establishment of . four, five or six board-
ing schools for an estimated 1200
Aboriginal children of school age
throughout the Territory.
He also said that the pastoralists were
prepared to work with the Government

The idea of the boarding schools -
endorsed before the Commission by M
Peter Baillieu, managing director of Kins

the huge Brunette Downs was that]
tribal influences could be “mitigated but
not destroyed”. After receiving a primary
school education only a “very small
number find their way to primary
school” now, Mr Kerr told the Com-
mission the children would receive
practical training in equipment main-
tenance as well as stock work. Some
might be placed in trades in town, others
in clerical work, but most would be em
ployed on stations. At the age of 15 o
16 the children would leave the board
ing schools, established on properties a
central points, to go to training camps!
After about two years they should then
be ready to work on equal terms witfl
other stockmen.

ans for a federal system of government;
though what was meant by federalism
was really a system of strong regional
governments which would derive their
powers from the central government
as in Kenya. In order to harness the
regional loyalties, Guise suggested that
the Territory be divided into four
regions: Papua, the Highlands, New
Guinea mainland, and the New Guinea
islands.
The first paper, on “The Problem of a
Constitution”, by Professor Geoffrey
Sawer of the ANU, referred to the Ter-
ritory as “Paradisia”, while Mr Justice
Smithers’ paper referred to it as “Para-
desia”, hardly yet the accepted name
for the new nation. Professor Sawer
felt the new Constitution for the Terri-
tory provided for the completion of the
Westminster model of parliamentary
government as one of the most easily
adaptable to the needs of a government
of an independent New Guinea.
Possibly the most controversial as-
pect of Professor Sawer’s paper was his
suggestion of setting up of a Judiciary
Council, an independent statutory body
of judges and magistrates, to appoint and
remove judges from office. He proposed
that a Bill of Rights be included in the
Constitution, but saw no value in it be-
ing included in the sort of positive social
claims to be found in the constitutions
of so many underdeveloped countries.
Mr C. J. Lynch urged the seminar to
pay close attention to the transitional
provisions on the way to independence,
and suggested that this transition take
place in gradual stages. He felt an
ombudsman should be appointed to
advise the House when measures were
taken that would interfere in any way
with the ultimate development of the
Territory.
On the final day of the seminar the
Port Moresby Declaration was drafted,
but there was some opposition as to
whether it should be any more than
educative. After some discussion the
Declaration’s “conclusions” were ex-
cluded from the final statement, which
amounted in the end to a very general
statement on the rule of law in a develop-
ing society.

Industrial Commission, Mr Justice Tay-
lor, last week gave unions and com-
panies in Broken Hill a month in which
to try to settle an outbreak of industrial
disputes.
The disputes involve a vigorous cam-
paign by contract miners for higher
earnings, a ban by the Workers’ In-
dustrial Union (the miners’ organisation)
on certain types of stoping and a
“darg” (limit) on total output. All con-
cern the Zinc Corporation and New
Broken Hill Consolidated mines the
city’s biggest.
In his “memorandum” Mr Justice
Taylor stipulated that there should be
fio limits on production while discussions
proceed. He expressed the view that, as
the companies and men were already
negotiating, and had reached a degree
of settlement, there was no reason why
the whole of the matters in dispute could
not be settled. Significantly, when Mr
Justice Taylor made his latest appeal, the
parties had already spent most of Tues-


‘ARE YOU A TRUSTEE?”
If you are a Trustee of . the Will or Settlement
of a relative or friend you may be finding
that the responsibilities and duties take up
most of your spare time.
You can hand over this responsibility by re-
tiring in favour of Winchcombe Carson

appoint the Company to act as your Co-

coupled with specialised attention.
Might we suggest, if you are in this position,
that you give earnest consideration to the
problem.
We would be pleased to discuss this aspect
and any other of the ancillary functions and
services of the Company with you, without
obligation.

day at the conference table and were re-
portedly near agreement.
“If the remaining matters in issue
cannot be settled in this way, there is
an alternative method which, at this
stage, I do no more than mention,” he
said. He was referring, of course, to
the possibility of arbitration being used.
If that did come about it would be the
first time since 1920.
However, it is generally believed in
Broken Hill that people higher up than
Mr Justice Taylor would be eager to
exploit the present impasse in an attempt
to extend the powers of the Arbitration
Courts to the Hill. Strangely, the
“arbitration for Broken Hill” movement
is not confined to the government in
power. A former secretary of the
miners’ union, Mr L. A. Johnstone, who
is now MLA for Cobar, recently warned
there were people in the State ALP who
wanted the Broken Hill system altered.
“I put it down to jealousy, and people
who don’t know what they are talking
about,” he said.

PUBLIC SERVICE
Crossing the Board
“The right to strike”
By GORDON CHEST ERMAN
The influential 23,000-strong Commonwealth Public Service Union, the Admini-
strative and Clerical Officers’ Association, will press for a select Parliamentary inquiry
into the operation of the Public Service Board.
The association’s move, decided at its
conference in Sydney last week, con-
firmed growing dissent within the Service
over the Board’s delay in finalising in-
dustrial matters, and its slowness in the
reorganisation of the second and third
divisions. Observers at the conference felt
that an inquiry by a select Parliamentary
committee would “speed up the proces-
ses.” The Federal Executive is expected
within the next few weeks to implement
this decision.
At the instigation of the Queensland
and ACT branches the association will
campaign for the independence of the
Public Service Arbitrator. Prior to the
amendment of the Public Service Arbi-
tration Act in 1952, the Arbitrator was
completely independent and his decision
final. But since 1952 the Arbitrator’s
decision can be questioned before the
Full Bench of the Arbitration Com-
mission.
According to Mr N. R. Campbell, the
re-elected president of the ACOA, this
followed the principles which applied to
outside industry and not the Public
Service. The association will also seek
the appointment of a second arbitrator
to assist the present arbitrator, Mr E. A.
Chambers, clear up the present backlog
of undetermined claims.
The NSW branch was successful in
having its “work to regulations” policy
accepted by the conference. Now the
association will endeavor to have the
section prohibiting the right to strike
struck from the Public Service Act. Mr
Campbell said the 23,000 members would
work to regulations if a vital issue of
industrial policy was involved, and
ether means to implementing this proved
unsuccessful. At the same time the
association decided it would take political
action against any party where necessary.
During the last Federal elections the
NSW branch actively campaigned against
the Minister for Labor and National
Service, Mr W. McMahon, and the then
Attorney-General, Sir Garfield Barwick.
Surprise of the conference was the I
election of 27-year-old Sydney solicitor,
Mr Peter Grimes, as Federal secretary.)
Mr Grimes won the position in a secret
ballot from the favored Mr Stan Irner,
who has been acting Federal secretary
for the past 18 months. Two others con-
tested this £75-a-week position, Mr Noel
Gamble, Department of Territories, and
Mr Dick Crossman. secretary of the
Australian Honey Board, but they
attracted little support.
Grimes and Imer both polled nine
votes, but on the re-ballot, Grimes gained
another supporter to win the secretary-
ship. Mr Grimes has had experience in:
both arbitration and industrial matters,!
and for some years has been an official!
of the Federated Clerks’ Union. Mr*
Imer will retain his former position!
of assistant secretary. |


An Outback Plum Duff
Menzies the politician versus Vernon the planner
By ALAN REID
When the Prime Minister, Sir
Robert Menzies rose in the
i House and with polite ferocity,
savaged his own creation the Vernon
[Report his was a political reaction. It
was a logical reaction from a man like
Menzies who, after a lifetime in politics,
is very much the political animal that
[Aristotle claimed all men are but which
jisa genus to which relatively few men
[belong.
■> Menzies’ reaction was logical because,
* though the Vernon Report appears
I superficially to deal exclusively with the
[Australian economy and economic mat-
ters, the report contains a lot of politics
'—theoretical, practical and departmental.
\ Not unexpectedly, it was to the
itheoretical politics that Menzies reacted
(most violently. Running through the
report is a consistent view of political
philosophy. This philosophy is that eco-
nomic planning is more appropriately
the field of the experts —the managers—
than of the politician. Although, of
course, this philosophy is not expressed
(as precisely as that in the report,
j The report advocates a proliferation
(of expert bodies —an advisory council on
j economic growth, a special projects
1 commission to “co-ordinate” Common-
wealth-State projects, an enhanced status
uor the Tariff Board, and a special con-
sultative body to guide the Reserve Bank
|°n overseas investment. The report then
goes on to emphasise that these will be
purely advisory bodies. Final decisions
and the ultimate responsibility will be
left to the Government of the day.
But the theme that the politician
should'increasingly abdicate the field of
economic responsibility to the specialist
—the expert —is there. And as Menzies
says—accurately—if such bodies of ex-
perts as the Vernon Report advocates
are set up, independent of Government
control and seemingly detached from
politics (and it would be only seemingly;
no group of men however well meaning
can detach themselves from their own
personal philosophies on broad issues),
there would be created a “coercive in-
fluence upon Governments”.
Personally, I think Menzies over-
estimated the necessity to counteract with
his unqualified condemnation of the
philosophy of government through ex-
perts which provides the basis upon
which the Vernon Report has been com-
piled. But this is a matter of judgment
in which Menzies’ assessment could be
much more accurate than mine.
Menzies’ criticism of the Vernon
Report’s policy suggestions (he did not
list those to which he was specifically
referring) was an extension of his reasons
for opposing the establishment of expert
committees with official status and a
degree of independence from the Govern-
ment. His Government could not make
policy or accept policies made for it
within the narrowness of a purely econo-
mic approach. In his view nor could any
other government. Governments had to
consider policies within a social context.
In effect, what he was saying was that
if you take economic growth (which is
desirable, indeed, essential to Australia
but to which the Vernon Report allo-
cates such overwhelming importance that
at page 26 of Chapter 17 in Volume 1
it feels called upon to make the self-
concious disclaimer “Our concentration
on economic growth does not mean that
we are obsessed with growth for growth’s
sake”) as the sole yardstick of a nation’s
progress you can justify some pretty
strange policies.
On this fundamental aspect of the
philosophical approach in the Vernon
Report I think Labor will endorse Men-
zies’ views. Labor certainly stands for
economic planning in much more detail
than the Liberal Party, which accepts
the proposition which Menzies enuncia-
ted on Tuesday: that “the demands set
up by people who are the buyers are
the normal stimulant for increased indi-
vidual investment and activity” (the
Liberal theory appears to be that the
State steps in merely to “lubricate” or
correct obvious socially undesirable dis-
tortions in an economy otherwise left to
find its own level in the free enterprise
sector).
But even more vehemently than the
Liberals (and on this both Right and
Left wings of the Labor Party seem to
speak with a united voice) Labor insists
that the planning should be under poli-
tical control and within a social context,
with the advice of experts only one of
the complex of factors going to make
up a policy decision.
Though the Government specifically
rejected a request from the committee’s
chairman, Sir James Vernon, general
manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining
Co., for the addition to the committee’s
terms of reference of a clause enabling
the committee to suggest “steps which ap-
pear to be necessary or desirable to con-
form with and further the objectives of
the Government’s economic policy” the
committee nevertheless suggested a lot
of steps which appeared necessary to the
committee to further objectives of the
Government’s economic policy. Among
these suggestions are a couple with
which Labor can enjoy itself immensely
at the Government’s expense.
Probably the most important one, as
it involves the question of Liberal-
Country Party unity (and hence could
threaten the stability of the non-Labor
Federal Government) is the commit-
tee’s recommendation on overseas in-
vestment. On this the committee has
followed a line which is closer to that

of Trade Minister John McEwen and
the Trade Department than to Treasurer
Harold Holt and the Treasury.
As summarised in Menzies’ comment
the committee has expressed the view
that it would be in the best interests of
Australia if some years ahead new capi-
tal from overseas were limited to the
level of about £150,000,000 a year, if
there were selective controls on overseas
investment, and if a consultative body
were set up to advise the Reserve Bank
on the administration of such controls.
As Mr McEwen has suggested (and
for a time apparently believed he had
secured) selective control over overseas
investment, Labor backbenchers imme-
diately perceived an opportunity to drive
a wedge further on this issue between
McEwen and Holt, who is a prospective
Liberal-Party leader, if and when Men-
zies decides to quit the Prime Minister-
ship and politics. Mr Jones (Labor
NSW) solemnly asked the Prime Mini-
ster, “What does the Minister for Trade
and Industry (Mr McEwen) say about it?
He mentioned selling a bit of farm every
year”.
Emotional and Chauvinistic
T abor, understandably and justifiably
will exploit this section of the report
which has an emotional and chauvinistic
aspect (of which neither McEwen nor
the Labor Party are unappreciative) just
as it will exploit other sections of the re-
port, including the one On shipping
freights. Again on this section the re-
port is closer to McEwen and the Trade
Department than to the Liberals. It
draws attention pointedly to a nettle the
Government has never really attempted
to grasp the fact that at times the
rates on Australian exports (carried in
overseas ships) are higher per mile and
“even absolutely higher” than those
charged Australia’s competitors (in ex-
port markets), operating at even greater
distances from markets.
Referring to the conference system of
. organised shipping services, the report
says: “Australian national economic in-
terests might be better served if a com-
pletely open and competitive shipping
service were to give reasonable assurance
of service and lower freight costs”. As
this is closely tied in with the Labor
(and Seamens’ Union) campaign for the
provision of a Government-owned
shipping service similar on the sea to
the Government-owned external air-
line, Qantas, in the air, this section of
the report is bound to get swiftly involv-
ed in inter-party manoeuvre.
Sections of the report additional to
those dealing with overseas investment
and shipping freights seem to reflect a
stronger Trade than Treasury influence
upon the committee’s deliberations.
This is not altogether surprising. The'
vice-chairman was Sir John Crawfordi
now director of the Institute of Pacific]
Affairs at the Australian National Uni-f
versity but for years Permanent Head oft
the Trade Department and close to Me!
Ewen. McEwen is reputed to have beeij
profoundly influenced in his approach to*
problems by Crawford, just as Crawfordi
was probably also influenced by McEwen'
who is a strong personality with strongl
views on most subjects. i
Even before the committee started itsj
deliberations there were signs of inter-
departmental feeling. Treasury has al-
ways manifested a suspicion of Craw-
ford, who when permanent head of the
Trade Department often advanced eco-
nomic views that were in opposition to
those of Treasury.
Departmental jealousies may not havi
played a part in deciding the shape o
the report. But they certainly playec
their part in determining the kind of re'
ception the report would get.
Weeks before the report was presented!
criticism of what was then said to be in!
it was freely available in Canberra. Tht
economics of the report were “jejeune”
and “unsophisticated”. Its prediction!
could not be trusted. They were basec
on imperfect statistical data and mistaken
premises. Some of the criticisms seem
to be justified. Others appear to have
been uttered more in the interests of
Departmental rivalry and to prepare as
atmosphere of distrust for the report’s
reception.
Basically the document was a pro-
manufacturing document which advocat
ed, as Menzies said, a consistent diver-
sion of resources from some areas ol
activity to others with, among these pre
ferred areas of activity, manufacture!
industry given “high place”.
It advances what, in my view, is i
contradiction in that it wants
used to divert resources to selected pur
poses, namely manufacturing, yet whilj
advocating that one section of the com!
munity be taxed to secure such divert
sion it simultaneously suggests variou|
incentives, including more general dep|
reciation allowances, to encourage fur-
ther the manufacturing to which the re
sources have been diverted.
It puts the consumer and the wage
earner (who collectively make up thi
bulk of the Australian community) at the
end of the queue as beneficiaries from
the growth-rate achieved by the form 0|
crypto-state capitalism it advocates, f
Despite the economic gloss there is I
lot of politics, theoretical, party an*
departmental in the report.
It is a bit like an outback plum dui!
made with faulty pastry. Over all it i'
not too good but there are some delect
able, and, in my view, highly valuable
fragments.

Miss
Archdale

Abbotsleigh
Combating conservative churchmen and conservative children
By CHARLES HIGHAM
Cricket performance, women's
rights, husbands and wives in Aus-
tralia, community theatre, the
church's teachings/school uniforms, the
Pill . . . you name it, and as likely as not
Betty Archdale will be quoted on it.
Every time anybody wants to get public
interest whipped up in a subject, sure
enough she's on the spot, her name in
heavy type, talking about it together with
people like Sir William Yeo, the Reverend
Ted Noffs, Andrea or Archbishop Gough
. . . Oddly enough, though, she's the
exact opposite, in person, of the pundit
one has expected. Shy, kind, rather with-
drawn, in a sober blue costume, high-
necked jumper with peeping blouse-col-
lar, sensible shoes and a silver brooch, she
seems odd as it may seem genu-
inely embarrassed by her own role as
spokeswoman on every known subject
along the alphabet from Anzac Day.
Daughter of a former suffragette who
was also a co-founder-editor of “Time
and Tide”, Betty Archdale first came to
Australia in 1934 as the captain of the
British Cricket Team (“Yes, yes we were
quite successful. We won all the
matches.”) Later, she joined the Bar, and
became secretary to the famous Labor
MP, Ellen Wilkinson. “Ellen had a heart
of gold and was wonderful to work for.
But she was a good deal farther Left
than I was,” Miss Archdale said.
“I remember she was bitterly anti-
Munich and I was pro. I rather think she
thought we should have fought in 1938.
I thought we needed another year, and
I still think so. We weren't ready then.
But I was very much out on a limb so
far as the Labor Party was concerned.
“Ellen was member for Jarrow. There
were 98 per cent unemployed there at
the time. Just one big shipyard, and when
that closed down . . . The Labor people
marched from Jarrow that’s in the
north of England all the way to the
House of Commons in London. And
Ellen, bless her heart, marched wdth
them. She was in her forties then. But I,
I must admit, drove beside her in a car.”
In 1940, Betty Archdale was a WREN
officer, and starting off in that capacity
most began in the ranks had run
her into some criticism. “I remember
they called me in after training and
asked me what I’d learned. I said I
hadn't learned a thing. They were a hit
hostile after that, I must say.”
After the war, she had become Prin-
cipal of the Women's College at Sydney
University, taking up her post of head-
mistress at Abbotsleigh School on the
upper North Shore in the mid-19505.
Where had she been at school herself?
“Bedales, and then St. Leonard's at St.
Andrew’s in Scotland.” And had she
found things very different in the school
world after all those years?
“I was, I will confess, rather shattered
at how few changes there in fact were.
Teaching methods were the same. Discip-
linary methods were the same. The girls
worried harder, of course. Far more wor-
ried about exams. And another difference
was that at my school going into trade
wasn’t quite the thing. Even when I went
back to my old school in the ’forties I
found that going into trade was frowned
upon.
“But here girls thought of learning,
something as well as the business of being'
married. I found things here very con-|
ventional, though. The social attitudes,'
too.” But she didn’t disapprove of, say,
school uniforms, didn't want a complete
break with them, as in America? “Oh,
no, no. 1 think a uniform is (a) econom-
ical and (b) it means no competition
among girls in the matter of dress.
“We take the senior girls to the theatre
out of uniform, but often they say to us,
‘Can't we wear uniforms?’ Everyone
worries so much about what they wear.
And for some girls there is quite simply
the problems of economics.”
Cramming? “We do cram. I know
that a lot of those facts are quite useless.
And at University they are told they
are all wrong, anyway.” What was her im-
pression of girls today as a whole? “Life
is very easy for them . . . they are in-
credibly casual about their belongings
. • . they will just lose them, pens and 1
so on . . when 1 was at school if one
lost one’s fountain pen it w'as rather a
tragedy. Not now.
“On the question of bright pupils, of
course only 20 people out of 100 in
any community are bright. Complete mis-
fits? Only about one per cent. Most of the
scholastically bright girls are also good
at sport, good all-rounders. And Austra-
lians are rather marvellous about that
one percent. They seem to sense their
difficulties, rally round and help them.”
Had she made Abbotsleigh a veryl
progressive school? “Only in the sense
that I do like to have a very friendly
relationship between the staff and the
children. I cannot bear this hate thing. I
But our actual teaching methods aren’t
very progressive. We do have Janna
Bruce teaching art. She’s an artist her-
self and has one picture at least hanging
in the Royal Academy. She's pretty ad-
mired, I believe. And we have a director
of music who is teaching the children to
compose. I do, also, welcome the pre-
sence of more modern books on the
syllabus. ‘Sons and Lovers'? Oh, most
certainly, yes.
“But you know the children in Austra-
lia are very conservative. I’ve tried to
bring in 20th-century folk masses and j
Flanders and Swann, that kind of thing,
and they quite like it, but on the whole
they rather like their church services to
be old-fashioned. Of course, as I’ve said,
this conservatism in a young country j
horrified me when I first came here, i
“I was amazed to see hats and gloves j
everywhere. I remember a group of us
from England after the war were asked

thought, ‘Oh good, a club,’ and wore

I thought they weren’t going to let us in!
Of course, it’s all due to the time lag.
Women?, Well, up our end of the line,
they’re, yes, still terribly conservative.
More material, less intellectual than
Englishwomen. Some are terribly clever
and read a great deal, but a great number
aren’t. Conversation? A sense of being in
touch? Almost blank. No. No, it doesn’t
worry me. I have my own circle.
“Religion? Well, this particular diocese
of Sydney is pretty rigid, wouldn’t you
say? And rather anti-intellectual, I’d add.
Marvellous, the diocese, for social ser-
vices. I don’t believe there’s any to com-
pare with it. But the theology from the
pulpit? That's pretty well medieval. The
whole Sydney diocese seems to me to
be run by rather dreary conservatives.”
How was she combating this at Abbots-
leigh? “We have Wednesday Chapel Ser-
vices at which a wide variety of people
will preach. Ted Noffs, Rabbi Brasch,
the Bush Brothers, some very Low
Church people . . . this gives the pupils
a number of points of view to think
about. I always believe in stressing the
short commandment . . . ‘And with all
thy mind’ instead of just ‘w'ith all thy
heart and with all thy soul’, and so on.”
She laughed loudly and with embar-
rassment at the inevitable mention of the
Pill. “Well, I’ll tell you the real story.
I take the sixth year girls in Current
Affairs. I might say, ‘What shall we talk
about today, China, Vietnam?’ And some-
one might say, ‘Why not the Pill?’ So
we’d discuss the wretched thing. Then
before the final exams we do talk about
the responsibilities of being a woman.
How to cope with a boy. The pressures
are on them from boys, of course. But
of course I don’t—as has been suggested
in the Press —have courses on the Pill!”
She laughed hugely. “The girls get a
good deal in biology, of course. Human
reproduction is included in the course.
Most of the girls have a very healthy
attitude and want to do the right thing.
But that phrase ‘instruct in the Pill’ is
something made up by the publicity
people at TCN . . .
“We don’t, by the way, allow make-
up. If girls_. come into class wearing it
we simply send them home to wash it off.
It doesn’t, you see, go with the uniforms.
No. No, there’s no promiscuity in the
early teens. They begin dating very early
but nothing like that happens.” Betty
Archdale smiled. “Of course, things may
go on without my knowing about it. But
I doubt that.” And watching her firmly
round off the sentence, one did too.

LETTER FROM NEW YORK
Tracking Down
Political Leaks
The Summer of the Sneeze
From GEORGE McGANN in New York
"No matter where you go you always see somebody worse off than yourself!"
46 T'|On’t Flush for Everything!”
I 1 That admonition in public lava-
tories has become as familiar to
New Yorkers in this Year of Big Drought
as the traditional warning, “No Smoking
No Spitting”, in the city’s subways.
With the vast metropolitan area
(estimated population in excess of ten
millions) parched and sere after the
fourth dry summer in a row, the tennis
officials at the National Championships
in suburban Forest Hills had to erect
a huge sign atop the Stadium “This is
Not City Water” —to explain the lush
green appearance of the 22 grass courts.
The tennis club at Forest Hills, like many
golf courses and industrial plants, obtains
its water from a private well on its
property and uses the city water system
only for drinking water.
Private lawns and gardens constitute
a disaster area throughout the suburbs
of New York. Any tell-tale patch of
green immediately stamps the owner of
a house as a sneaky night-time hoser.
Neighbors are as quick to report a
nocturnal lawn-waterer as they would
be to report a midnight prowler.
For anyone with sensitive nasal pas-
sages or asthma, this has been the
Summer of the Sneeze. With street
washing drastically curtailed, the num-
ber of dust particles in the air has leaped
from a “normal” figure of about two
million to five million.
The city authorities have launched a
propaganda campaign in the Press and
on TV and radio designed to reduce
water use sharply. Songwriter Richard
Rodgers and his wife have made a TV
short based on his song, “My Favorite
Things”. Mrs Rodgers holds up a gleam-
ing crystal water goblet as her husband
comments, “How precious, too, the water
that goes into it!”
The New York “Daily News” ran a
contest among its readers for suggestions
to save water. Among the prize-winners
was the advice to take the family car
out of the garage when it rains and wipe
it clean afterward. Advertisers have
been quick to leap aboard the water
wagon. Beer ads emphasise that “water
is too valuable to drink”. One Fifth
Avenue departmental store is selling
“personalised” bottles of water, with the
customer’s name printed on the side, to
mix with the evening scotch or bourbon.
With the city in the thick of a heated
political campaign for the office of
Mayor and lesser municipal offices, it
was certain that the water shortage would
become a major issue. In fact, this
campaign is the wettest one since Pro-
hibition was abolished.
As the “New York Times” observed,
“water seems to have drowned all other
issues”, with various candidates splash-
ing around barelegged in subway caves,
ferreting out leaking water mains and
poking through the bushes on the edge
of the Central Park reservoir, seeking
marshy patches and other evidence of
leakage. The opposition candidates have
been loudly blaming the incumbent
Mayor, Robert Wagner, for every leak
(and there have been some beauts) dis-
covered, despite the fact that the entire
city water supply system is an antique,
with many underground pipes more than
100 years old.
Water shortage has traditionally been
a problem in the western part of the
United States, but only recently has
become threatening in the south and
east. It has arisen as a result of a pro-
longed drought (now in its fourth year),
growing pollution of water supplies from
industrial and municipal waste products
(including widespread use of household
detergents in place of soap), and the
natural increase in population.
In 1950 the country consumed about
200 billion gallons of water daily. Its
consumption today is 340 billion gallons
and by 1980 consumption will have in-
creased to 600 billion gallons. New
York City has been using water at the
rate of 1250 million gallons a day. But
with its reservoirs down to one-third
filled, compared to a normal level of two-
thirds, the city’s consumption has been
cut back to 950 million gallons.
It is clear that the city will need new
sources of water supply to meet demands
of the near future, even should the
drought disappear. With this in mind,
Governor Rockefeller has authorised,
with the assistance of Federal funds, con-
struction of a nuclear-pow'ered desalinisa-
tion plant at Riverhead, Long Island, to
go into operation by 1968.
This plant, which will cost four million
dollars, will utilise atomic energy to
convert sea water into electric power
and fresh water through a distillation
process w'hich has already proven feasible
in similar operations on the Gulf of
Mexico, on the Persian Gulf, and in
Italy, Israel and South Africa. Recent
improvements in the distillation process
have reduced the costs of producing
fresh water from the sea from one dollar
per thousand gallons to 32 cents or by
about two-thirds. However, this figure,
estimated for the Riverhead operation,
is still more than double the 14 cents
that New York City pays for water from
its upstate reservoir system and more
than five times the amount Los Angeles
pays to pipe its drinking water from the
Colorado River and other distant sources.
Desalinisation experts admit the great
“breakthrough” which will make sea
water available in limitless quantities for
Australia and other arid areas still lies
ahead.
Meanwhile New Yorkers pray for a
seasonal Caribbean hurricane to come
this way as in many other autumns. One
howling tropical storm would do us
more good than a hundred leak-hunting,
politicians.


A Stake in the Old Country
Doing their hit for the Commonwealth
From R. J. SCHOFIELD in London
As the fingers of winter reach for the
throat of Britain’s tourist trade,
not all the Australians saying good-
bye are doing so as guests. In at least
two of the establishments that have
absorbed this year’s flood of holiday-
makers in the United Kingdom, Aus-
tralians have been the hosts.
One of these is a Queen Anne mansion
with lots of plainness and dignity called
Glebe Country House, near Truro,
Cornwall, which is “England's Riviera”.
The other is Lochnaw Castle, with
towers, turrets and keep, as genuine as
the whisky that comes from the same
area, Stranraer, known as “Scotland’s
Cornwall”.
The title of the Cornish house belongs
to a company formed by a Sydney
woman, Miss Del Agnew; Lochnaw
Castle is her property.
In other ways, too, the two places,
500 miles apart, have much in com-
mon. They are both old, with a good
deal of history in their stones. They are
both off the beaten track an enviable
quality these days when it is hard to find
an acre that has not been blighted by the
affluent masses and their motor cars.
They are situated in two of the mildest
parts of Britain. Both make their own
bread from organically-grown grain, both
are thought odd by the locals and both
are run by professional men one a
dentist, the other a doctor with the
aid of their families.
They also have in common the mystery
of why these Australians are operating
them at all, for they make little or no
profit, and would seem, unless capital is
pumped in, to have scant future as busi-
nesses.
The missionary zeal the Australians
are applying to their British enterprises
was tempered some years ago in the
fires of controversy that raged over the
fate of several old houses near Sydney.
In 1952, Miss Agnew, an interior deco-
rator, formed a company in Sydney
called Tinker Tailor Pty Ltd, attached to
an organisation with the fairly singular
purpose of saving historic Australian
buildings from the wrecker.
The first rescue performed by the
company was that of “Wellings”, the
Lloyd-Jones family’s home at Burwood.
But plans misfired because the local
council withheld permission to do cater-
ing on the premises. “Wellings” was then
turned into a residential club. Then came
the purchase of another old house, St
Malo, at Hunters Hill. This time permis-
sion was obtained straight off to run it
as a catering establishment, but before
long a crisis came in the form of notice
of an expressway development that would
require the old place’s removal. There
ensued a fight that has become for the
Tinker Tailor people a sort of rallying-
point.
Despite the petitions, meetings and
letters to the editor, officialdom won the
day for its expressway. The struggle also
established Miss Agnew as a one-man
national trust.
Meanwhile, in 1956, during a business
trip to Britain, Miss Agnew visited her
ancestral home, Lochnaw Castle, which
had passed out of the family’s hands
a family whose British founder came
from France with William the Conqueror
and which owned the castle from the
time it was built in 1427 until almost
the present day. One branch of the
Agnew family owns the magazine
“Punch”, another an art gallery in Lon-
don.
In 1958 she bought the old place, with
its rhododendron gardens, rambling
stables and gaudy Victorian glasshouses,
back again, reputedly for about £14,000,
and put Tinker Tailor people in to run
it not as a hotel, exactly, but, in the
jargon the fraternity has coined, “the
alternative to a five-star hotel”.
The first manager was Mrs Humphrey
Deck, who with her husband now runs
Glebe Country House. She did the job
for three years, he meanwhile practising
elsewhere as a dentist and visiting the
castle at weekends. Mrs Deck is also a
partner in another of Miss Agnew’s pro-
jects, a handcrafts shop in Beauchamp
Place, Chelsea, one of London’s most
exclusive streets and the one where an-
other Australian enterprise, the “Can-
berra” restaurant, not long ago went
broke.
Just before returning to Australia in
1959, Miss Agnew met in London the
"Lovely morning , Mr Gulliver?"
owner of Glebe Country House. So
Glebe Country House, although gone to
seed in the hands of owners who had
flimsily partitioned off rooms to squeeze
out the last pennyworth of rent, became
the property of Tinker Tailor Pty Ltd,
of Sydney. The partitioning was pulled
out and plaster scaled off walls to show
the original stone.
Humphrey Deck, a tall, shy, former
Sydney dentist, comes nearer than any-
one else to explaining what it is all
about, although only in terms that affect
him personally. Dr. Alan Lane, who
runs Lochnaw Castle and is general over-
seer of both operations, offers explana-
tions which, although more objective,
are less satisfying.
Dr Lane’s castle, which is perhaps not
large by castle standards but would
make a hefty boarding-house, accommo-
dates only a dozen or so guests. There
is about its operation a flavor that
strikes somewhere between the Salvation
Army and the Boy Scouts, a sort of pri-
mitive piety that is less helpless than it
looks because it demands a certain type
of guest to go with it. There is also
a touch of Robin Hood, for Lane ad-
mits that the guest who looks as though
he can pay is inclined to be milked in
favor of, say, the honeymoon couple
who will be given the best suite to enjoy
their bliss at a discount. One of the
first of Dr Lane’s honeymoon guests
was his uncle, Sir Earle Page.
“We have no hotel liquor licence
here”, said Dr Lane. “A coachload of
tourists could come and spoil the atmo-
sphere. When we inquired about rais-
ing money for improvements a bank
manager advised us to put in a bar, but
we have stuck to our ideals. People want
something other than what can be
bought. So many come to this country,
from Australia and elsewhere, and SEE
other people but do not MEET them.”
Lochnaw stands on. the edge of a loch
fringed by trees and flowering shrubs and
with its own small island on which the
ruins of an 1 lth-century fortress provide
perches for water-birds. Woodlands
recede to heathered hills and the sea.

Castle called the Commonweal Club. It
began as the “Commonwealth Club”, an
idea of Miss Agnew’s, but there was a
legal objection to the use of the term
“Commonwealth” so they clipped the

last two letters off and made it authentic
by printing at the head of a list of club
objectives a 1959 quotation by Queen
Elizabeth: “For the Weal of the King-
dom”.
The club has about 300 members and
is dedicated, among other things, to “the
jealous guarding, proclaiming, and nur-
turing of particular and peculiar cultural
traits and characteristics both in speech
and way of life, traditionally associated
with the individual nations within the
Commonwealth, and actively deploring
and resisting the subjugation or submerg-
ing of their individual “national personal-
ities”. Another aim is “the vigilant care,
appreciation, re-establishment and use
of those treasures, both cultural, artistic
and architectural, which have been basic
and intimate in the development of the
‘national personality’ and history of our
countries”. Still another calls for the
restoration where possible of notable
clan and family seats by their descend-
ants throughout the Commonwealth.
“The Commonwealth”, said Dr Lane,
“is slipping because its members don’t
need each other enough. Sir Robert
Menzies once said: ‘The Commonwealth
is not one unless we make it so’. When
you save old houses you cannot help
getting a sense of what they mean
where they come from and what is worth
preserving and what is not. This leads
naturally, even inspirationally, to the idea
of such a club to give history modern
meaning”.
Apart from the locals, who must find
the club one of the few ways of meeting
other human beings in the backwater of
Stranraer, most of the members are
tourists who do not miss £l. What the
club does for them after they have
moved on is a bit vague. “It is still in
embryo,” said Dr Lane. “So far as action
is concerned, the club’s value is potential,
although in terms of goodwill and friend-
ship it is already active”.
Morton Rides Again
Everything except the tightrope
By PATRICK TENNISON
Great Morton’s” show
opened in Melbourne. At once
he ran into trouble. On his open-
ing night, someone stole his guitar and he
had to fill in for more than an hour while
police hunted the thief and friends
scoured around for another one. The
critics “panned” him sourly. They said
he talked too much, the show was too
slow and, anyway, it wasn't very bright
or new entertainment.
“All round, I’ve had a bad run from
the papers,” he complained a few days
later. “The reporters they sent to inter-
view me were too young to remember
me from the old days. lust boys they
were. Some still had pimples. And if
one decides to get stuck into you, they
all do.”
Today Robert Morton is not sure
whether he is 49 or 50. His advance
publicity in Melbourne had him billed
as “The Great Morton'’ and it was not
until just before the show opened that
he let it be revealed that the man in
the goatee was the same who years ago
travelled with just a moustache as Tex
Morton.
Trying to talk to him after a per-
formance is a confused business. Inter-
ruptions pour into his backstage dress-
ing-room.
“About half a dozen at the stage door
want to see you,” his manager told him.
“I’ll be there in a minute,” Morton
said. Then, explaining, “There are always
some like this who want me to help them
personally by hypnosis. People with
homosexual tendencies. Nail-biters. Bed-
w'etters. I could spend the rest of my
life helping them. I’m not in that
business. I just tell them to go and see
a good doctor.
“I’m back in show business and
I can’t mix it with anything else,” he
said a minute later. “The Queensland
Arts Council want me to tour Queens-
land reciting. I want to go all over Aus-
tralia again with this new show, but I
can’t decide whether to do the country
places first or not.
“I don't dance and I don’t walk the
tightrope,” Tex Morton said, totting up,
“but I suppose you could say I tackle
every other form of show business.”
Well, let’s say several, anyway. In a
rather surprising one-man performance
at the Melbourne Princess he sings,
recites Banjo Paterson, sharp-shoots at
cigarettes in his assistant’s mouth, tells
a few yarns and then winds up with
a Franquin-style hypnotism segment.
Only, as Morton tells it, that stuff
Franquin was doing all over the country
years ago was really a Morton-style
hypnotism act.
“Franquin's a New Zealander, like me.
We both learned from the same teacher.
I brought the act over to Australia in
the early ’3os, long before Franquin.
But in those days hypnotists were a dime
a dozen. Thousands of them. They
advised me not to do the act here, so
I concentrated on my singing and rodeo
acts. But, really, I’ve been a hypnotist all
along.”
Morton's sudden, unheralded return
has been quite a shock. To most Aus-
tralians Tex Morton is synonymous with
his old-time partner, sister Dorrie, a long-
lamented dog named Shep he used to
sing about, double-breasted suits, victory-
roll hairstyles and the sawdust of show
tents and outback rodeos.
Sister Dorrie now lives in Brisbane, is
retired from show business and is a
teacher - demonstrator with a kitchen
appliance firm “She teaches girls
how to demonstrate those Mixmaster
things,” Morton said.
Shep still crops up now and then in
the old song, but just occasionally. Times
and moods change.
It is nearly 20 years since Morton
closed down his rodeo-wild-west travel-
ling show, hung up his guitar and with
the money made from them and a small
pile of singing and reciting records
headed for the US to lecture and further
his studies in hypnosis. He returns as
Dr Morton, having picked up a Ph.D. for
a thesis he did on therapeutic hypnosis
and with several years of travelling and
performing with his new-style show in
the US and Canada behind him.

ON THE MARGIN
Post Festival Triste
Adelaide’s reputation for being keen
on the arts was let down by its luke-
warm response to the Sutherland Opera
Company. But Mr John McCallum, of
J. C. Williamson’s, offered a convincing
explanation of the citizens’ reluctance to
attend. “Adelaide gets cultural indigestion
from its Festival,” he said. “It isn’t much
interested in anything in between.”
More populous centres do not under-
stand the ordeal endured by the gallant
little festival cities. The same symptoms
of artistic surfeit are noted in Edinburgh.
During the lay-off season there it is hard
to lure the inhabitants to any entertain-
ment more demanding than the Beatles.
In Bayreuth cases of Wagner neurosis
are well known; the sufferers burst into
tears at the sight of a woman wearing
a helmet.
From accounts I have heard, the strain
of the Adelaide Festival is unusually sev-
ere because the wine industry is mixed up
with it. Visitors say on their return:
“There was so much
to do. One after-
noon we had the
claret carnival and
the hock hootenanny
as well as four art
shows. Then in the
evening there was
the vermouth rally,
the Patrick White play, the Bartok fiesta
and the burgundy ball.”
Adelaide has a hard core of culture
commandos, trained to the last ounce,
who can take this punishment and come
back for more. But it is small wonder
the populace at large is flat to the boards
for a long time afterwards.
The general problem of culture fatigue,
of course, is much wider in scope than
the local difficulties of Adelaide. It is
a result of steadily increasing pressures
more and more LP records, foreign
language films, art exhibitions, little
theatres, and literary criticism.
The artistic matters the public has to
keep up with have become more difficult.
Time was when one could acquire a
reputation for advanced tastes by having
a couple of Brahms records and a print
of Van Gogh's Sunflowers. Now there is
homework to be done on twelve-tone
composition, the theatre of cruelty and
garbage sculpture.
Inevitably, with some, fatigue sets in.
It may lead to complete cultural break-
down; the subject begins furtively at
first, then openly to read James Bond
books and view Bobby Limb’s Sound of
Music.
However, science is taking an interest
in the problem. It is being studied at the
Culture Fatigue Research Unit at Sydney
University, under the direction of Dr
Waldo Melius. He was kind enough to
talk to me about the work of the Unit.
“Our first task is therapeutic,” Dr
Melius said. “We try to help people who
are cracking under the strain of the
present cultural pace. We see some pitiful
cases here.
“One young man came to us in a
state of collapse. He couldn’t understand
John Olsen’s abstracts any more. He had
lost interest in poetry written by com-
puters. He could not pay homage to
Homage to Garcia Lorca.
“His social group had ostracised him
and he was barred from Vadim’s. To
make his guilt feelings worse, he had this
craving to*see My Fair Lady.”
I asked what treatment had been given.
“I put him under
sedation,” said Dr
Melius, “then I said:
‘lf you want to see
My Fair Lady, see
it. Get it out of
your system.
“Gradually hi s
confidence came
back. Soon we had him going to Berg-
man films and explaining Fairweather’s
paintings. Today he is completely
normal. He has even had an article
accepted by Nation .”
“That is marvellous,” I said. “And
what other work do you do at the Culture
Fatigue Research Unit?”
“Our biggest project is a training pro-
gramme for those who are exposed to
extreme cultural pressures,” he said.
“This is where we can help the people
of Adelaide. We are confident we can
toughen them to a point where they can
take four art shows, a display of Eskimo
carvings, a poetry workshop, the Black
Theatre of Prague, and an atonal opera
in the one day.”
“What about the wine-drinking,” I
asked.
Dr Melius opened a well-stocked cup-
board.
“Wine is drunk all the time,” he said.
“That is fundamental.”
He paused. “Looking into the future,
we must give some thought to Perth,”
he said. “Their festival has not built up
much yet, but I see work for us ahead.”

AROUND MELBOURNE
Pop Goes the Cash Register
The dogs get a bite at the market
'VT’our correspondent is not very
clever when it comes to picking
sounds; to him the Liverpool sound
and the Elvis sound seem depress-
ingly the same. Yet in the past 18
months, and particularly in the last
six months, the Australian sound has
begun to take over. To put it in the
correct cash-box language, “Austra-
lian produced singles are now snatch-
ing a major slice of the air play.”
To give you some idea, last week 16
of the records on the 3DB Top 40
were Australian and 13 on the 3UZ
Top 40 were Australian. The top of
the 3DB chart was “Little Boy Sad”
sung by a group called MPD Ltd. What
the Ltd is for is hard to guess, but
MP and D stand for the names of the
three members of the group, Mike,
Peter and Danny. They had a curious
rise to fame. When performing at
Festival Hall Mike fell over and broke
his guitar. At first they thought they
were ruined, but not so. The crowd at
Festival Hall thought this was far-out
kinky behavior and the group went
on to fame and fortune.
Actually 1,5, 6 and 8 in the top
bracket of the chart are Australian
records. Two years ago, it was a
major achievement for an Australian
record to make the chart at all. To hit
the top was practically a miracle.
This week your correspondent called
on the man who he feels knows most
about the Melbourne disc scene, Ron
Tudor. Until recently Tudor was with
W & G records. Now he is with Astor
and the Go label. He is a very lively
character. His favorite expression is
“Crazy, man, crazy.” Tudor is in a
state of euphoria over the new trend.
He says Australian records got off to
a shaky start 10 years ago with names
like Col Joye, Johnny O’Keefe, Johnny
Chester and the Thunderbirds. Then
came the great English invasion, The
Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks
and all the rest. “Crazy, at this stage
we couldn’t give away an Australian
record, let alone sell one. We were the
first country to give mass acceptance
to English singles. The Mersey-beat
discs didn’t hit the rest of the world
until a year later. This meant that they
got a second bite at our local market.”
“But then,” said Tudor, “the Austra-
lians were smarter than the Americans.
They tried to tackle the English at
their own game. We developed our
own groups such as the Easy Beats,
Cherokees, Bobby and Laurie,
Strangers, Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs,
The Flies, The Seekers, The Changing
Times, MPD Ltd, The Pink Finks, The
Jackson Kings. Man, don’t ask me
where they get those names. But don’t
you see? Before, we couldn't compete
because the Americans would have
Frank Sinatra, Vic Damone, Dean
Martin or somebody with a big-deal
orchestra. But now we’re right in it. To
make the charts all you need is a smart
little group of three or four with their
guitars. Usually they compose their
own numbers. The costs are way
down.”
Well, what was coming next? Ron
Tudor said the big trend at the moment
was “message” records. “Everybody’s
getting in on that one,” he said. “The
big hit in America is ‘Eve Of Destruc-
tion’. The fellow chants that the whole
world is on the eve of destruction. One
guy has only to push a button and
we’re all in the grave. Then there’s
an answer spng called ‘Dawn Of Cor-
rection’. This points out that the
Americans are a fine dedicated bunch
with the UN, the Peace Corps and all,
and they’re trying to sort everything
out.” Then Tudor put on the latest
Australian production in this field, the
Dargies singing ‘Strange Rain’, a dear
little number all about atomic fall-
out and a woman pleading for the
life of her baby.
As Ron Tudor said: “Can you
imagine 10 years from now a couple
holding hands in a restaurant. The
band plays ‘Eve Of Destruction’ and
she-says to him, ‘Darling, they’re play-
ing our song’. Crazy.”
BATMAN
SWAINSVILLE


THE WEEK
OVERSEAS
THE KREMLIN
Changing of
the Guard?
fFHE Austrian capital of Vienna was
buzzing last week with reports of
imminent changes in the Soviet leader-
ship. Even the news of China’s ultimatum
to India could not divert attention from
the rumor —believed to have come from
Moscow that Mr Leonid Brezhnev,
First Secretary of the Soviet Communist
Party, is to be replaced by Mr Suslov,
the party’s chief ideologist, and that Mr
Alexei Kosygin, Chairman of the Coun-
cil of Ministers (Prime Minister) is on
his way out, too. As far as one can
discover the renewed speculation about
these two men is due to two factors:
(1) Reports of Mr Brezhnev’s state of
health (which show striking resemblance
to those which preceded Mr Khrushchev’s
“retirement”). Mr Brezhnev is said to be
completely exhausted and recent visitors
to Moscow describe him as “a very sick
man”. According to this source the
change-over will probably take place in
November, when President Mikoyan
should retire on reaching the age of 70.
(2) The comings and goings in Mos-
cow and other East European capitals and
the hastily-arranged talks between Soviet
and East European Communist leaders
have not ended. This lends credence to
suggestions that something unusual is
happening. The latest bloc leader to
turn up in Moscow is the Hungarian
Prime Minister, Mr Gyula Kallai, and
Mr Janos Kadar, the Hungarian party
leader, is expected there at the end of
the month.
Well-informed Austrian sources, how-
ever, believe that the recent discussions
were concerned more with radical
changes in Soviet economic planning
to be announced next week—than with
personal changes at the top. (ofns.)
GERMANY
Much the Same
same again: the mixture as before.
The Christian Democrats have won
again, and again. In all probability, there
will be a small coalition with the Free
Democrats.
And yet the landscape is not quite the
same. The general bet in Bonn was that
ge CDU would lose a few seats, but
keep their lead over an increased Social
Democrat opposition. Unexpectedly, the
CDU and the Social Democrats put on
votes. The Social Democrats gained
three per cent. But the CDU and their
Bavarian sister-party, the Christian Social
Union (CSU) also raised their vote by
2.2 per cent. Now comes a leisurely
period of coalition and Cabinet-building,
rich in rumors but probably sparse in
hard fact until Erhard stands before the
Bundestag later this month for his elec-
tion as Chancellor. For the leading West
German politicians, these will be weeks
of tense manoeuvring and significant
decision.
Erhard, rather to his party’s surprise,
has turned a defensive action into an
impressive victory. He has more than
confirmed his reputation as a “vote loco-
motive” to haul the party to power. He
has demonstrated that public opinion
prefers him to Dr Adenauer. He has
put out of court the possibility of a
“grand coalition” with the Social Demo-
crats. This would have been feasible if
the parties had emerged almost neck and
neck, and as it was opposed by Erhard
and favored by the powerful Adenauer-
Strauss-Gerstenmier Right wing of the
party, he would probably have lost his
job if such a coalition had been formed.
Erhard has gained power over his
enemies within the party. But will he use
that power? Will he, for instance, keep
his ally the Foreign Minister, Dr
Schroder, in office and beat back those
“Gaullists” who want a man colder in
the cold war, warmer to de Gaulle?
German foreign policy will not change
for the moment, but the double crisis
in NATO and the Common Market will
almost certainly revive the old confronta-
tation between “Gaullists” and “Atlan-
ticers” within the CDU-CSU. (ofns.)
INDIA-PAKISTAN
A New Alliance
HThb ceasefire between India and Paki-
A stan was achieved largely owing to a
tacit alliance between America and
Russia. Not since the Second World War
have the interests of the two superpowers
been so identical in a major crisis. Here
Moscow and Washington were linked in
total agreement that continuation of the
fighting could only serve Peking and
undermine their own positions in Asia.
Mr Dean Rusk, the Secretary of State,
described Russia’s attitude in a rare
compliment as “helpful”, and President
Johnson ruled out unilateral action to
maintain this common front. The White
House repeatedly insisted that the United
Nations alone was qualified to intervene.
The end of the shooting will automati-
cally reduce China’s chances to stir up
trouble in the Indian sub-continent and
US officials believe that the Chinese
threat against India has now drastically
diminished. According to Boris Kidel of
the London “Daily Maifl’, Washington
never thought there was a real danger of
a full-scale Chinese invasion.
It considered that China's leaders
wanted to create the maximum of turmoil
at minimum cost and risk. Their main
aims were to:
1. Create trouble in India in the belief
that her political structure would
eventually crack up under succes-
sive blows.
2. Force America and Russia to take
sides in the India-Pakistan dispute.
3. Humiliate India and demonstrate
to other Asians the weakness of
Parliamentary democracy.
4. Prove to Communists throughout
the world that Russia is in col-
lusion with “Western imperialism”.
(Peking radio lost no time accusing
Russia of “singing a duet” with
America at the Security Council.)
The US Government regards its com-
mon front with the Kremlin in this crisis
as of strictly short-term duration. In the
long run, America and Russia remain
titter rivals for influence in India and
Pakistan. But, the two countries, faced,
by the Chinese challenge, may be driven
into tacit alliances in other parts of the
world. No US politician is at present pre-
pared to regard such occasional identity
of interests as a new permanent factor
in global politics. For it is realised that
Moscow must be constantly on guard
against Chinese charges of “selling out”
to the West
INDIA
Man of Steel
HThe ceasefire leaves Mr Shastri, India’s
Prime Minister, stronger than the
war found him. The conflict with Paki-
stan has finally united India behind a
leader whose major attribute before was
his capacity for compromise.
It gave the Indian Army, humiliated
by the 1962 Chinese rout, a chance to
re-establish its reputation, and it accentu-
ated the split between Moscow and
Peking of India’s 170,000-strong Com-
munist Party. The chances of a military
coup in a country as big as India were
never high. Now they are non-existent.
The army was certainly unhappy with
the Rann of Kutch agreement, but
India’s direct attack on Pakistan changed
that. Always projected as meek, Mr
Shastri showed he was a “man of steel’’.
It should have come as no surprise
from a man able to rise through the
devious strata of Indian politics to

become number two to the formidable
Nehru. He had already proved his
power at home during the ruling Con-
gress Party’s general meeting at Banga-
lore in July. There he outwitted
opponents of his Kutch agreement and
steamrollered through a change in party
rules to allow his right-hand man,
Kumar-Swamy Karamaj, Congress Presi-
dent, to be elected for a second term of
office. This will enable Karamaj to
nominate pro-Shastri candidates for the
1967 general election. There is no
obvious alternative to Mr Shastri as
India’s leader today.

divided between Moscow and Peking
after China’s attack and a thousand of
the pro-Peking group are now in gaol.
They were arrested with little fuss in
January under the Defence of India

message. They have been solid sup-
porters of Mr Shastri’s war policy. The
Communist threat is extremely long-
term. Although the conditions for Com-
munist subversion poverty and ignor-
ance— are rife, India’s affection for
democracy is too strong to be broken
easily. Mr Shastri still faces the two
major problems that have so far beaten
him food and language. With the
prospect of peace ahead, and proof of
his strength behind, he may now be able
to tackle them.
LAOS
The Merry-Go-
Round
T>rince Souvanna Phouma of Laos
has turned a blind eye on the wreck-
age of his “Provisional Government of
National Union” (as it is legally called),
and has nominated leaders of the pro-
Communist Pathet Lao to posts in his
new Cabinet.
Prince Souphannouvong, titular chief
of the Pathet Lao, becomes Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister of
Economic Affairs and Planning the
posts he held in the former Cabinet.
Mr Phoumi Vongvichit, another Pathet
Lao veteran, has been allotted the port-
folios of Information and Tourism, while
two Pathet Lao officials, Mr Kham-
pheuane Tounarom and Mr Souk Vong-
sak, have been named Secretaries of
State for Economic Affairs and Public
Works respectively.
The Pathet Lao maintain an ominous
silence towards Prince Souvanna’s latest
overture. Earlier, their-radio station in
the Plain of Jars proclaimed that the
National Assembly elected last July con-
sists entirely of Right-wing and “Right-
neutralist” deputies, and is completely
illegal. In fact, the elections were rather
less than democratic. Voting was re-
stricted to an electorate s of 21,000
people, drawn from Government officials
army officers and merchants, and did
not extend to areas controlled by the
Pathet Lao.
But the show must go on, even if
some star performers abruptly leave the
stage. In effect, Prince Souvanna is the
head of an indissoluble Government.
Only sudden death or exile can remove
its principals. Mere refusal to accept
the legality of the Government is not a
sufficient cause for disbarment as
Prince Souphannouvong must now realise.
As long as they live, and as long as
symbolic elections can be arranged, the
same Ministers will appear in the Cabinet
lists published in Vientiane. What is
more, this unique system has the back-
ing of Britain, the United States, the
Soviet Union, India, Australia and other
powers involved in Laotian affairs.

Clash of Color
To Copenhagen, for inherent abhorribility
From TARZIE VITTACHI
former Asian Director of the International
Press Institute
Is color prejudice inherent in human
beings or is it implanted? Professor
Edward Shils, of Cambridge Univer-
sity and head of the Committee on
Social Thought at the University of
Chicago, is not convinced by the liberal
notion that it is acquired or implanted
and therefore eradicable. He wonders
whether there isn’t an “inherent abhor-
ribility” about dark skins. If not, why is
prinfitiveness generally associated with
brown or black skins? Why are the sym-
bols of purity, virtue and the forces of
good always white and evil always
dark? Why, indeed, is day the time of
God and night the time of the devil?
These questions coming from Shils,
noted for his progressive attitudes and
abiding interest in the growth of Asia
and Africa, compelled a stocktaking of
some fundamental assumptions among
students of social behavior who, be-
cause of their inherent or implanted
liberalism, prefer to think of color and
race prejudice as a remediable human
aberration.
Shils was speaking at the first Con-
ference on Race and Color sponsored
by the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, and the Congress for Cultural
Freedom held in Copenhagen from Sep-
tember 5 to 10. Thirty sociologists,
anthropologists, social psychologists,
civil-rights workers, economists and
writers (from Africa, America, Latin
America, Asia and Europe) analysed
color and racial prejudice from experi-
ence in their specialised fields.
Recent social studies in Japan lend
substance to the theory of “inherent ab-
horribility”. Professor Hiroshi Wagat-
suma, of Kobe University and the Insti-
tute of Human Development at the Uni-
versity of California, has revealed that
long before the Japanese had any sus-
tained contact with Caucasoids, Euro-
peans or dark-skinned Africans or In-
dians, they regarded white skins as beauti-
ful and abhorred black skins. In a stu-
dious paper on the relationship between
skin color and the perception of femi-
nine beauty in Japan, Wagatsuma says:
“White skin has been considered an es-
sential characteristic of feminine beauty
since recorded time. There is an old
Japanese proverb stating that ‘white
skin makes up for seven defects’. That
ls to say, a woman with light skin
causes one to overlook the absence of
other desired physical features.”
Professor Wagatsuma’s writing throws
a fascinating light on a hitherto unex-
plored aspect of World War II: “Though
it seems somewhat painful for most Jap-
anese to be frank about it (and many
of them refuse to do so), among the
Japanese intellectuals there is a more or
less unconscious, if not conscious, am-
bivalence or inferiority-superiority com-
plex felt towards Western civilisation,
toward the world of white people. Such
an attitude is not at all unreasonable
if one takes even a brief glance at
Japan’s modern history, wherein Japan
first feeling overwhelmed by and ap-
prehensive of the great power of the
Western world, caught up with it in an
amazingly short time: then, feeling a
sense of rejection over unequal treat-
ment, Japan appointed herself a cham-
pion of non-white Asiatics, and in this
role boldly tried to win a place for her-
self in the company of white im-
perialists . . . The Japanese eyes may
maintain their Oriental physiognomy but
they perceive themselves as part of a
modern Western world conceptualised
in Western terms.”
The Africans, American Negroes and
Asians who heard him at Copenhagen
received this sociological evidence from
Japan with admiration mixed with a
trace of bitterness. Mr Louis Lomax,
American Negro author, television per-
sonality and civil-rights worker, expres-
sed his admiration and gratitude
for the revelations from Japan but pro-
duced some contrary and fire-new evi-
dence of Japanese skin-color perception
in Los Angeles.
During the August riots Negro-owned
shops escaped looting when their pro-
prietors scrawled “colored” on their win-
dows. Japanese shop-keepers caught on
quickly. They, too, escaped looting by
scrawling “colored” on their windows.
This brought the discussion on., “in-
herent abhorribility” down with a bang
from the groves of academe to street
level where color prejudice lives and
lurks. Perhaps, despite its historical an-
tiquity, color prejudice is a matter of
survival an “independent variable”,
as the academicians insist on calling it
which, like love, alters when it finds
itself caught in the vortex of social and
economic relationships. That, at any
rate, was the dominant view emanating
from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, from Harvard and from
Chicago University.
Anthropologist Julian Pitt-Rivers be-
lieves that color prejudice is not a one-
way street which has always moved to-
wards the black end of the spectrum.
On the contrary, he says, in human
myth and legend, black has been as-
sociated for centuries with the sacred,
and white with the profane. Hence the
choice of black for the robes and gowns
of judges, clerics and dons. The sacred
was unpredictable, uncontrollable and
mysterious therefore black and
the profane obvious, banal and white.
Professor Harold Isaacs of MIT and
Professor Talcott Parsons of Harvard
found the notion of a color prejudice,
primordial and irremovable, horribly un-
accepted scientifically and instinctively.
But Dr Francois Ravaeu of the Centre
de Psychiatrie Sociale had proved by
laboratory experiments that certain
kinds of fish find other fish of certain
colors “inherently abhorrible”. He con-
ceded, however, that, in controlled experi-
ments in group-dynamics conducted in
Paris, he has established that in a poly-
chromatic group of intellectuals the ag-
gressions that appear after some time
divide on intellectual rather than color
lines.
This points a way for people over the
color bar through education, the sharing
of common experience and exchange of
information about the ways of one
another. But it seems that this is not
enough. Professor Florestan Fernandez
of Brazil exploded the popular belief
that Latin America had overcome color
and race prejudice by these means
not the least being miscegenation of the
Iberian races with the Negroes and In-
dians. He put his finger right where it
hurts: “A Brazilian racial dilemma does
exist and it is of a structural nature. In

order to face and resolve this dilemma,
a change must be made in the structure
governing the division of income, social
privilege and power, establishing a rea-
sonable amount of economic, social and
cultural equity between the white people
and the Negroes and mulattos.”
Apparently, the competitive economic
forces, even in an open society which
does not tolerate legislative or official
discrimination on racial and color
grounds, does not guarantee social
equality. The “weight of the past” frus-
trates the equalising tendencies of com-
petition and creates new grounds for
discrimination in the form of class or
caste. Professor Pitt-Rivers put it even
more succinctly: “The black man who is
rich is white and the poor man who is
white is black.”
None of the American dons was wil-
ling to regard economic differences as
more than just another factor in the
complex of “independent variables”
that go to make up color and race pre-
judice. Only Professor Parsons of Har-
vard appeared to concern himself
seriously with Peking’s attempt to per-
suade Asia, Africa and Latin America
to view the modern world as an in-
tolerably unjust division between a
white bourgeoisie and a colored prole-
tariat. It was pointed out that the
danger in this propaganda was that it
implied that not being white was the
cause of impoverishment. From Brazil’s
experience of the “weight of the past”
Peking may have something.
But Dr Robert Gardiner, a very wise
Ghanaian, now secretary to the UN
Economic Commission for Africa, be-
lieves that however tempting this rea-
soning might sound in theory, it has not
gone down effectively in Africa for
three reasons: (1) There is still lots of
time before any ideology can crystallise
among African people; (2) African states
are unwilling to align themselves con-
sistently with any power bloc; and (3)
African countries still value the pos-
sibility of using international machinery
and multilateral co-operation to solve
their problems. He might have added a
fourth: that since, as the Japanese sug-
gested, the “yellow” races feel closer to-
ward the whites and South Africa, for
instance, accepts the Japanese as “hon-
orary whites”, it will be tough going for
the Chinese to prove the validity of their
color affinity towards the Africans.
Unaccountably, the only reference to
the “White Australia policy” was made
by an Asian who commented on the
strangeness of such a blatantly color-
biased doctrine existing in a country
where the people themselves were
“genuinely color blind”. The fact that
an Australian colleague in Sydney, dur-
ing a convivial evening, had addressed
him as “you beautiful brown bugger”
indicated to him that “brown” was not
used in a pejorative sense at all he
felt that it was rather the contrary.
Even more unaccountably, South
Africa was left out of the discussion—
causing Mr Ezekiel Mahphalele, a bril-
liant and still not hopelessly embittered
exile from South Africa, to lament: “I
came here hoping to find some ray of
hope for us. I came hoping to find that
there was an effective unanimity in the
world outside that would rally behind
us in our struggle. But now I know that
I was expecting too much. Must we fall
back on our primitive instinct for sur-
vival?”
As two governments with official
color-bar policies were out of the fray,
Britain and its “hypocritical White Paper
on immigration” came in for the most
persistent attacks from the American
Negroes present and from Mr E. B.
Braithwaite, one of the most eloquent
advocates of the West Indian cause. He
fears that if the British will not pro-
vide “the opportunity for a dialogue be-
tween the host country and the immi-
grants” the immigrants would be com-
pelled to talk another language. The
director of the Institute of Race Rela-
tions in Britain, Mr Philip Mason, made
the mistake of trying to glance this
gently to leg by observing languidly that
“the British are not keen on having a
dialogue with anyone at all. They just
want to be left alone.” But Mr Louis
Lomax caught him out smartly. “How
can a nation which not so long ago
imposed their will on more than a third
of the people of this planet now claim
that they only ‘want to be left alone?’ ”
The Gomulka Letdown
“Very sad indeed ”
By RICHARD KRYGIER
A fter an exhilarating period of relative
which followed Wladyslaw
Gomulka’s accession to power in Poland,
the area of such freedom as there was
has contracted until now it constitutes
little more than freedom of talk though
not of speech. At the same time, the ap-
paratus of police oppression, partially
dismounted in 1956-57, has been greatly
strengthened and given more scope.
The danger signals of the last few
months are plain for all to see: the clos-
ing of magazines with a faint trace of
“revisionist” tendencies, return to the
publishing of books selected on grounds
of politics rather than merit and a general
application of “paper, shortage” as an
additional weapon of the censors. This
“paper shortage” trick was condemned
by 34 of the leading Polish writers and
academics as clearly endangering the
foundations of Polish culture.
This powerful protest has brought
about repression and counter-action. The
signatories were banned from publishing
in magazines, their foreign travel was
first stopped altogether and then restrict-
ed and a counter-protest was organised
which was signed by over one hundred
writers of somewhat lower status. At
least 40 Communist Party members
among writers refused to sign either the
protest or the counter-protest.
Then veteran Polish writer Melchior
Wankowicz was sentenced to three years’
gaol for having sent out a report “inimical
to Polish interests” which found its way
to the offices of Radio Free Europe in
Munich, an American-financed radio
station operated by Polish exiles. Wan-
kowicz’s sentence was then commuted to
eighteen months and feelers were put out
that he had only to undergo a medical
examination to have the gaol sentence
waived. This Wankowicz refused to do
and has since got a number of letters,
each more polite than the previous one,
inviting him to see the Government
doctor. At the moment of writing he
has not done so, nor has he been locked
up to serve his sentence.
This ridiculous stalemate is perhaps
symbolic of the whole situation. Gomulka
is too weak to grant civil liberties, yet he
is also too weak to reimpose a really
brutal dictatorship. So he is muddling
along, solving none of the acute economic
problems of the country and giving it a
most indolent and corrupt administration
with the helpless planners facing the
spectre of hundreds of thousands of un-
employed now and more to come.
Currently there is the case of three
writers under indictment for “defaming”
Poland abroad.
However, the case that has really
shaken the Polish leadership is that of
Stanislaw Cat-Mackiewicz, obviously the
most colorful and the ablest Polish
political writer inside and outside Poland
today. Mackiewicz has always been a
stormy petrel. A conservative and a
monarchist in pre-war Poland, he was
very active during the war in London,
warning about the threatened betrayal of
Poland by Britain and America.
In his hatred, Mackiewicz gave Britain
much more credit for cleverness than she
deserved in the sordid period of war-
time diplomacy. So it was probably
logical that, after a stint as Polish
“Prime Minister” in exile, he suddenly
denounced the Western powers for their
betrayal and defected to Warsaw.
Then something must have snapped
again. Soon after the “Protest of the
34” broke oift, the excellent Paris

monthly “Kultura”, which —among Pol-
ish exiles—has probably the closest con-
tacts with Poland (despite being banned
there), startled its readers by publishing
almost stenographic records of various
secret writers’ meetings. The articles
were signed Gaston de Cerizay. They
betrayed an excellent pen. quick intelli-
gence and considerable wit.
Mackiewicz’s happiness at again liv-
ing in Poland and writing there has
proved short-lived. For whatever has
gone badly in Gomulka’s Poland, the
police apparatus has proved its mettle. It
identified Cat-Mackiewicz and de Cerizay
as one and the same person, discovered
the way in which the manuscripts were
being smuggled out of Poland, and ac-
cused Mackiewicz of slandering the
country
For those of Australia’s literati who
compare Checkpoint Charlie in the
Berlin Wall to a toll-gate on the Sydney
Harbor Bridge, the trials and tribulations
of these Polish writers cannot mean
much. But the fact of the matter is that
in a few short years Stanislaw Cat-
Mackiewicz, who returned home full of
hope, has been forced to exclaim “Life
in enslaved Poland is very sad indeed”
(“Kultura”, June, 1965).
At about the same time as this turmoil
among writers was going on. two young
Warsaw University lecturers. Modzelew-
ski and Kuron, were sentenced to 31 and
3 years’ prison respectively. They are
both Party members. In fact, they were
among the very few active Party mem-
bers on University staffs
Modzelewski is the son of old-time
Communist functionaries. It appears that
he came back from Italy imbued with en-
thusiasm for the “Italian line”, and
especially for the free discussions and
debates going on among Italian Com-
munists. On his return Modzelewski
tried to institute such free discussions
without presenting any particular co-
herent line of his own.
The discussions organised by Modze-
lewski had been confined to Party mem-
bers only. Papers presented were kept
away from non-Party members. But even
this, timid and tentative as it was, over-
stepped the rigid confines of free discus-
sion. Modzelewski and his friends have
been suspended as Party members and
threatened with the loss of their Univer-
sity positions. This has not silenced the
group.
But academic freedom and academic
tenure have not proved more of a shield
in Communist Poland than in Com-
munist East Germany, Russia or Hun-
gary. The heavy sentences followed soon
enough. They are obviously meant to
serve as a twofold warning to the young
a general warning to young intellectu-
als not to criticise and a particular one
to the sons and daughters of the ruling
elite.

“It Feels Good to be a New Zealander”
After Dr Verwoerd , the end of an era
From MAURICE SHADBOLT
Rugby pushed Vietnam and the Indian-Pakistani conflict off the front page of newspapers here and
in South Africa this month; and for once there was good reason. It seemed like the end of a long journey
on two counts. First, the end of Rugby relations (the epic Springbok-All Black clashes) between New Zealand
and South Africa. Secondly, this country showed for the first time a rare and astonishing unity on the issue
of race discrimination in sport. ,
It all started with a statement by Dr
Verwoerd the day after the Springboks
hammered the All Blacks 19-16 at
Christchurch their first test win
since the 1965 team left South Africa
for Australia and New Zealand in June.
An occasion, one might think, for
goodwill as well as South African
jubilation.
But the story really begins six years
ago in 1959, when the New Zealand
Rugby Union decided, for the second
time since the war, to exclude Maoris
from the All Black team to visit South
Africa in 1960. The decision gave rise
to heartburning, protest and bitter argu-
ment which lacerated a country both
sport-loving and increasingly race-
conscious. The then Labor Government
tried to play it cool, likewise the
National Opposition. There was to be
no intervention in the affairs of a
sporting organisation. Late in the piece
a few MPs, both Labor and National,
expressed individual doubts; but the all-
white All Blacks were rushed quietly
out of the country (after being furtively
taken to a farewell reception through
the back door of Parliament). The
country was left simmering, and the
affair has been a running sore on the
conscience of the nation ever since. A
petition bearing some 180,000 names
many of the most distinguished in
the country was buried, but not for-
gotten, in a dusty corner of the capital.
So was, presumably, a Victoria Cross
returned in dismay by an Anglican
clergyman now working among Maoris.
The country could never really be
the same again, nor race relations. In
the years since even the powerful, rich
and sluggish New Zealand Rugby
Union has had to acknowledge a moral
defeat, despite its apparent success in
continuing the highly profitable All
Black - Springbok exchanges. Seeing
future tours threatened it has from time
to time in the last five years made
ambiguous mutterings about possible
inclusion of Maoris in future teams for
South Africa. From the South African
Rugby Board came similarly reassuring
sounds. In 1964 two prominent Maori
Rugby men visited South Africa as
guests but strictly as non-players.
Apparently anxious to oblige their hosts
and prepare the way for Maori players,
they returned loud in praise of
apartheid; one said he had been aston-
ished to see black people everywhere—
“in the streets, in shops, in lifts, and
even looking after white children”. The
result was a verbal fracas in which they
■were denounced by many of their own
race. It was put about that Maoris
might be acceptable as players on the
next All Black tour in 1967 under
the curious and conceivably insulting
classification “honorary white” (there
was precedent for this in the
case of Japanese visiting South
Africa).
In the meantime Mother
things had been happening
within New Zealand. The
1961 Hunn report (delayed by
the Labor Government, and
finally produced by the new
National administration with
a justifiable moral flourish) re-
vealed a potentially perilous
situation in racial affairs here.
As the mounting Maori popu-
lation - (annual increase: 3.7
per cent) flowed into urban
centres there was a clear build-
up of dark-skinned, unskilled
second-class citizenry. The
future social implications were
obvious. The Hunn report
proposed one solution: educa-
tion. Within a few months the
Maori Education Foundation,
subsidised £ for £ by the Gov-
ernment on public appeal, was or-
ganised: the response from the Maori
race itself was tremendous. Possibly it
is unfair to judge the Foundation’s work
yet: results may not really begin to
show for another two or three years.
But it is certain that Maoris are now
more education-conscious than at any
time since the Maori wars of the 1860 s
which cut right across progressive
Maori efforts to come to terms with
the European world. In the Auckland
region, for example, there has in recent
months been a rash of adult Maoris,
many middle-aged, going back to
school there are now perhaps three
or four hundred of these adults prepar-
ing for School Certificate and Univer-
sity Entrance examinations.
All this has had side-effects on the
pakeha New Zealander too. For one
thing, it has made him more conscious
of the social and educational handicaps
against which the Maori has been
laboring. In Parliament a Bill has just
gone through outlawing racial discrim-
ination in property leases and sales.
There has been a determined effort to
build bridges from race to race; but that
affair back in 1960 still rankled. Minis-
ter of Maori Affairs, Ralph Hanan, said
last year it wouldn’t happen
again. Most observers took
this to mean that the Govern-
ment would refuse passports to
any racially segregated team
purporting to represent New
Zealand, though later the
Minister denied the implication
of direct Government inter-
vention. But the interesting
thing then was the degree of
support such a drastic propo-
sition (even if unintended)
received from the New Zealand
Press - which just four years
earlier had spoken with a con-
fusion of voices and in general
had sided with Rugby racial-
ism. There had been a clear
change in the mood of the
country.
Then came the Springbok
tour of this year. It all began
rosily. Again there were am-
biguous assurances from both New Zea-
land and South African Rugby adminis-
trators that there would be no real
problem about Maori players going
on the return visit to South Africa
in 1967. In the light of later
events, this has now been seen as a
deliberate attempt to mislead the
country and to cut the ground from any
recurrence of public protest: a public-
relations effort to make the Springbok
visit as pleasant and profitable as pos-
sible.
At the beginning of September Dr
Danie Craven (“Mr Rugby”) of the
South African Rugby Board flew into
New Zealand to see the final matches
of the Springbok tour. On television
and elsewhere he declared that arrange-

TOP PRIZE
WINNER FOR
TWELVE YEARS
Since its introduction in 1953, Orlando
Barossa Riesling has won more awards
than any other Australian Riesling.
One hundred and thirty-two major
awards, in fact, including Gold and
Silver Medals, Championships and Cups
throughout Australia and in Europe.
Last year, its greatest honour was the
Gold Medal awarded at the International
Viticultural and Wine Fair at Mont-
pellier, France, world-famous centre
for wine Study and research.
Every bottle of Barossa Riesling awarded
a prize has been taken at random from
stock proof positive of the wine’s
unfailing consistency.
Two major reasons why you can rely
on Barossa Riesling are:
* It is bottled in the traditional European
amber Riesling bottle, in preference to
a green bottle, because Riesling needs
bottle age, and ambe'r glass keeps
out the light while the wine is aging.
* It is one of the very few Australian
Rieslings vintaged 100% from Rhine
Riesling grapes.

10983
ments for the 1967 tour would be
“satisfactory to all parties”. The state-
ment -was front-page news in South
Africa, and in New Zealand.
But that was just lightning before a
storm. In high-powered public state-
ments both Dr Verwoerd and the South
African Minister of the Interior, Sena-
tor De Klerk, made it clear that there
was no question of a racially mixed
New Zealand team being received in
1967 or at any time ever: New Zealand,
according to Dr Verwoerd, was
expected to conform to “South African
customs”.
An apparently stunned Dr Craven
at first refused to believe his Prime
Minister’s pronouncement: he insisted
that he had “other facts” at his dis-
posal. But the cat was soon well and
truly out of the bag. A day or two later
Senator De Klerk reiterated his and
Dr Verwoerd’s statements so there
should be no misunderstanding, and
said Dr Craven had never had the
slightest authority from his Government
to suggest Maoris might ever be accept-
able as Rugby players in South Africa;
nor had anyone else at any time had
the authority to say so.
A saddened and rebuked Dr Craven
bowed his head and gave way at last
(a sardonic Wellington columnist offered
him political asylum). The “Johannes-
burg Star” said: “Dr Verwoerd has
struck New Zealand in the face”.
In South Africa the issue was settled.
In New Zealand, too. The country had
spoken with one voice. Left and Right
were indistinguishable; the politicians
who had not dared challenge the
national sport in 1960 were this time
unanimous. So was the Press.
In Parliament, the Prime Minister
rose to tell the country that “as we
are one people we cannot be fully and
truly represented by a team chosen on
racial lines”. Nor could the Govern-
ment regard the principle of racial
equality as “outweighed or qualified by
special considerations which have
domestic application elsewhere in the
world.” He reaffirmed New Zealand
hostility to South African apartheid.
Leader of the Opposition/ Arnold
Nordmeyer said the NZ Rugby Union
would be “flying in the face of public
opinion” if the events of 1960 were
repeated.
At the end of a confused week,
Wellington’s “Sunday Times” summed
up neatly: “By turning our backs on
a sporting spectacular which has been
the most popular of them all, for a
principle striking the very composition
of our nation, we have found maturity
as New Zealanders ... It feels good
to be a New Zealander.”


FORUM
Four Brigadiers
and the CMF
Up a garden path?
The security of Australia has been
placed in jeopardy by the present
defence policies and, despite the
enormous effort and expense now being
put into the Services, the position, rela-
tive to the increasing and widely recog-
nised threats from overseas, is in no
way improving. We are in peril and will
remain in peril until some of our pro-
fessionals are told not to be so bloody
silly, and a scheme of integrated defence,
based largely on the citizen soldier, is
evolved by the Service advisers and ac-
cepted by the Government.
Admittedly there was, and is, an ur-
gent need to expand the Regular Army
to meet our treaty obligations, to de-
fend our new border in New Guinea
and to provide relief units and rein-
forcements in Borneo, Malaya and
Vietnam. But there was no need to re-
duce the CMF to impotency. In fact,
the reverse is true, for without an en-
larged CMF spread in formations
throughout Australia we have absolutely
no chance of rapidly expanding our
forces to meet a full-scale threat to our
own shores or to our immediate north.
Both financially and in terms of the
number of able-bodied men (multiplied
by the numbers necessary to service and
maintain them) withdrawn from our
already overstressed pool of employables,
there is a pretty well defined limit
to the strength of our permanent forces.
The production of even one ARA divi-
sion with its supporting units and aux-
iliaries is already straining the resources
of the peace-time army. So far, we have
managed to raise five infantry battalions
plus a limited number of supporting units
(nowhere near the number we would re-
quire in a major struggle) out of a cur-
rent strength of, perhaps, 28,000 in the
ARA. To raise a division of perhaps
14,000 men we will have to raise the
strength of the ARA to 40,000. What
is this costing in cash?
In 1964-65, in salaries and allowances
alone for an average ARA strength of
25,000, we paid out some £34,000,000.
With the projected ceiling of 40,000 to
he reached by a leisurely 1967, and al-
lowing for inevitable increases in the
scale of salaries, it seems certain that
the salaries and allowances bill will then
he in the vicinity of £58,000,000 a
formidable slice from any defence bud-
get. Of this large sum, £20,000,000 will
go to the ARA division of 14,000 men.
Despite all this, the unassailable fact
is that the ARA just cannot meet the
threats and problems likely to arise. It
must be pointed out that even the fairly
low tempo of the demands from Borneo,
Malaya and Vietnam where, so far,
operations have been little more than
strenuous training exercises have
badly stressed the organisation and the
ability of the ARA.
Yet, says the ARA, it is capable of
providing commanders, staff, logistic
personnel and instructors to quickly
train a National Army in event of a
real threat. This is blatant and obvious
rot!
In the House of Representatives on
August 31, Mr P. Stokes, Liberal MHR
for Maribyrnong, presented the case for
building up the CMF. A lieutenant-
colonel who served at Tobruk, Mr
Stokes said: “Those of us who experi-
enced the inglorious schemozzle of 1939-
40 do not want a repetition of that sort
of thing.” In this article, three serving
CMF Brigadiers, A. E. Arthur, L. G.
Parkinson, R. T. Eason, and Brigadier
W. H. Hall (CMF Retd) take up the case
for the CMF.
Now to look at the other side of the
coin the CMF. Whilst the ARA has
been expanding steadily and whilst the
new National Service has been insti-
tuted for the benefit of ARA, the
CMF has been less than holding its
own. With the withdrawal of the ARA
units from 1 Div. we are left with one
and one half CMF divisions with a re-
duced scale of supporting troops. Paper
strength has shown a steady run down
from a peak of 87,291 in 1956 (the
full effect of National Service) to
27,505 in 1964 (source Defence Re-
port, 1964). From our own investiga-
tion, effective strengths (attendance at
camps, etc.) would appear to be little
better than 50 per cent on enlisted
strength. The CMF is further weakened
by raids on its officers and NCOs by
the ARA.
The voluntary system, which has never
worked well, has been persisted in, de-
spite its obvious inefficiency. The CMF
goes into camp under very bad condi-
tions and with a minimum of assistance
from the ARA. The attractive picture
of the CMF-ARA as one Army, so
carefully built up by wartime command-
ers like Red Robbie, Rowell and Wells
during their post-war appointments, is
now steadily dissolving.
We feel that the present set-up and
future trends as we know them have
all the elements of a future national dis-
aster for the good and simple reason
that it makes no provision for a quick
and smooth mobilisation of our civilian
population in the event of a major threat.
History has dozens of examples of dis-
aster precipitated by just this.
We feel that the raising of a minimum
of five CMF divisions with the necessary
Army and Corps HQs, plus supporting
troops, should be set in train now. It
should start with the senior formations
being raised and trained and when these
units are themselves capable of carrying
out the task, they should in turn raise
and train headquarters down to bat-
talion. This stage will at least give us
the ability to organise large-scale in-
takes of civilians in the shortest pos-
sible time. The HQs visualised above must
be strong in instructional personnel. In
this regard the ARA can make available
a steady stream of excellent people too
old for active duties in the field and
who are now either stood down or put
into unsuitable jobs.
Following the firm establishment of
the HQs the next step is the introduc-
tion of recruits. This can be done quite
simply by the continued extension of the
present call-up to eventually include
all youths of 20. These lads can be given
the option of serving five years in the
CMF with a further five years in re-
serve, or two years in the ARA. It is
possible that given this option sufficient
would join the ARA, but if not, a modi-
fication of the present ballot system
could make the necessary allocation.
The CMF need not be filled to estab-
lishment for quite a long time provided
there is a sufficient number to allow
efficient training, particularly of junior
leaders. Obviously, the ideal would be to
give the potential CMF recruits a period
of continuous training as in the old
National Service. Equally obviously, this
is just not on at the moment.
To sum up, the immediate aim should
be to establish HQs and as soon as pos-
sible train every able-bodied man to
take his place in some form of service
to Australia.
Cost, of course, is a factor to be con-
sidered, but the cost of the CMF is
infinitesimal compared to the ARA. It
is a fact that, as far as salaries and al-
lowances are concerned, it is possible to
train fourteen CMF divisions for one
ARA division.
We feel that there should be an en-
quiry into the Army set-up not on
the probably ethereal level of the
Morshead investigation which ap-
pears to have been suppressed but a
real down-to-earth enquiry into just
where the nation is being led by our
professional advisers. It seems to us that
it is being led straight up the garden
path!


Letters to the Editor
Striking Oil
SIR. Your editorial, "Using up the Oil"
(B„ Sept. 18), states as facts several assump-
tions that require examination:
(1) That a national fuel policy should in-
clude conservation (restricted production) of
crude oil reserves. Reserves do not exist
until they are discovered and developed, and
private enterprise could not risk the cost of
oil search without expecting to obtain reason-
ably rapid recovery of their expenditure from
any oil fields they might discover. A natural
crude oil deposit cannot in fact be produced
beyond limiting rate of withdrawal without
causing permanent damage and loss of re-
coverable reserves. Fuel reserves for defence
emergencies could be maintained by storage
of refined products in natural or constructed
underground reservoirs, where the fuel could
be withdrawn at the required rate. This,
however, has no bearing on national fuel
policy in respect to oil search. A well
developed oil-producing industry including a
pipeline network, storage facilities and re-
fineries as well as proved oil fields, certainly
would be a valuable defence asset. This can
only be obtained by long term development
of commercially viable oil fields produced for
normal domestic market requirements. The
supported price will make most oil discoveries
commercial. The main national interest justi-
fying public support of oil search is to reduce
importation of oil, the largest single item in
creating foreign trade deficits. Restriction of
production of Australian oil should be con-
sidered only when and if Australia becomes
self sufficient in crude oil.
(2) That the independent oil search com-
panies do not welcome the new crude price
protection. The independent exploration com-
panies at the Tariff Board hearings supported
high protection prices against the opposition
of most of the major refining and marketing
companies. They also would welcome in-
creased subsidy, but oil search subsidy, paid
out of public funds, is no alternative to price
protection, which ; s paid for by the refining
and marketing companies.
(3) That the refining companies will be
reluctant to push forward with more vigorous
oil exploration because of the high price of
local crude. On the contrary, the refining
companies should find it advantageous to try
to develop their local crude supply, which
would be less costhv than having to purchase
local crude from others at a relatively high
cost.

About Brian Fitzpatrick
SIR. I had dinner with Brian Fitzpatrick
the night before he died. He was in fine
form, his conversation including an occasional
tilt at the Communist "Party line" and the
doctrinal differences between Pekingites and
Muscovites. Of course he would have
appreciated a "warts and all" obituary but
your columnist's reference to his "having
been so long a victim of Stalinist propa-
ganda" (B„ Sept. 11) fails utterly to compre-
hend the man I knew in recent years: the
man who made no bones about his opposition
to American interference in Vietnam nor the
suppression of the Hungarian revolution, nor
indeed to the deprivations in liberty suffered
under a variety of Communist regimes.
To talk vaguely about Brian Fitzpatrick's
allegiances having been "a mystery deep
at the heart of our time" sounds like cant to
me, nauseatingly pontifical. In the 'thirties
many Leftists mistakenly sided with Stalinism,
including Bernard Shaw, for instance. Why
they were tempted tc do so ought to be
apparent from such a book as "The God
that failed". No mystery about it.
Whether Brian Fitzpatrick, at a stage prior
to my acquaintance with him, sided with
Stalinist propaganda I do not know, but I
think he could have given a good account
of why the Left should have hoped to find
common cause with Communists, and an un-
compromisingly truthful version of why and
when this was not possible. Yet he remained
a dedicated and intelligent disciple of the
Labor movement. "Mysterious" to those
who have no patience or sympathy with
any of the shades of Left-wing thought!
Mysterious, perhaps, to those who like to
stifle argument and enquiry. Brian Fitz-
patrick was not such a one.

Moment Of Truth
SIR. Brian Johns' article, "Catholic Moment
of Truth" (B„ Sept. 11), refers to the absence
of any mention of Fr Crittenden's paper (read
at the Seminar at Melbourne University
Newman College) in either Melbourne's
"Advocate" or the Sydney "Catholic Weekly".
He mentions that the "Catholic Weekly" had
reported "a slightly higher Pass rate" for
Catholic students in matriculation examina-
tions. He failed to mention that on page one
of the same edition there was a report that
gave a most interesting reason why this
should be so. The report stated (from an
analysis by Dr P. Fensham) "that a factor to
be considered in the granting of scholarships
was the number of pupils from various
schools who obtained scholarships at the
second attempt. This weighed heavily in
favor of independent schools. About 40 per
cent of scholarships gained by boys at
independent schools were gained at their
second attempt. There was no evidence that
Government schools actively encouraged
pupils to stay on for an extra year".
This means of course that parents who can
afford to send their children to private schools
can also afford to keep them at school for
an extra year enabling many of them to
gain valuable university scholarships. These
parents later recoup their outlay on the extra
year's schooling by the saving of university
fees for perhaps three to six years. There can
be no doubt that it is an advantage for
children born into affluence.

Hon. Sec., The Association for the
Preservation of Public School Education

SIR. I have not read Fr Crittenden's article
on Catholic schools, but from Brian Johns'
summary it is clear that Fr Crittenden's pro-
posals for the future of Catholic education
are based on an erroneous premise. For him
the school is primarily a means by which
society "expresses and develops its unity and
distinctive character". In a Christian philo.
sophy of education, the school is primarily*
an institution to assist the parents in theiij
educational task, and the right to educate!
and to determine the kind of education theiif
children shall receive belongs primarily to
the parents. This basic human right (incoij
porated in the UN Declaration of Humail
Rights) has not been lost by reason of the!
"social and educational developments of the!
past hundred years".
Do Catholic parents want their children to!
be educated in Catholic schools? For a
hundred years th;.y have shown that they
do, and it will not take much educational
research to discover that as a body they
still do. To refute Fr Crittenden's other argu-
ments would take more space than you
could allow me. But if anyone finds them
plausible, I suggest that he reflect on the
interesting fact that when an anti-Christian
regime gains control of a country as in
Nazi Germany, one of its first moves is to
close the Catholic schools. Fas est ab hosti-
bus diseere.

Wildlife And Ignorance
SIR. I appreciate Mr Raymond's timely
article (B„ Sept. 4) "People v. the Continent",
He points the finger directly at the greatest
enemy of this country's wildlife ignorance,
No one knows the animals the conservationists
want protected nor why they should need
protection at all. As long as this ignorance I
persists conservationists will be working hr
a vacuum the issues they raise will be |
just too abstract. Mr Raymond also points!
out another great defect. The study of ecology
is ignored when large-scale development pro-
jects, such as the brigalow and wallum
developments, are planned.
I would like to take Mr Raymond up on
one point. He mentions the Australian Con-
servation Foundation and says, "But who
knows about it?" There is a full account I
about this foundation in the latest issue of
"Wildlife in Australia". This quarterly also
combats the ignorance that allows our wild-
life to move quietly into oblivion.

Miles Davis
SIR. Doubtless Mr T. Forbes Cameron's
comments (8., Sept. 11) on my review of the
Miles Davis album, "My Funny Valentine",
were prompted by his own high regard
the trumpeter.
Since Miles Davis first appeared on records,
I have devoted considerable time to trying
to understand the enthusiasm of his manj
fans. In the process I learned to respect him
for his creativity, his eventual mastery ol
his instrument, his harmonic and rhythmii
innovations, and his uncompromising attitude
and have said as much in previous reviews.
But in spite of my recognition of these,
qualities, I have seldom enjoyed listening toj
him. To one of my generation (I have been
listening to and playing jazz for thirty years)
his work is too often depressing ("gloom
.ridden"), empty or destructive in its melodii
content ("anti-melodic"), and tonally unsatis
fying ("toneless mutterings") when compares
to men like Clayton and Armstrong. He(
ignores too many of what I consider the jaz!
essentials.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Assignment in Adelaide
By TERRY STAPLETON
The long hair still flops in careless,
school-boy fashion across the un-
lined forehead. The smooth skin is
still unquestionably pinkish and cherubic.
But around the eyes, and, more signifi-
cantly, in the eyes, are convincing signs
of considerable maturity. At last John
Tasker is almost looking his age. Which
isn’t surprising.
As Director of the South Australian
Theatre Company, 32-year-old Tasker
has completed the first six months of an
exhilarating, exhausting and perilous
assignment: to establish a professional
company in an atmosphere of financial
uncertainty, the inevitable public in-
difference and a faint suggestion of hos-
tility and suspicion from the existing
amateur groups whose talent he would
be courting.
Since April, Tasker has spent six or
seven-day weeks producing, planning and
worrying. After three productions and
one country tour, both he and his com-
pany have earned a good deal of respect
and faith.
The formation of the company is
probably the Elizabethan Theatre Trust’s
most important move since it established
Sydney’s Old Tote Theatre two years ago.
Director Tasker sees his appointment as
“the most important thing I've ever had
to do,” and with much justification he
feels he is “the ideal man for the job.”
Few interstate theatre people have had
Tasker’s opportunity of evaluating Ade-
laide’s talent and resources. During his
Trust/University Theatre Guild pro-
ductions of Patrick White’s plays he
worked closely with the best of Ade-
laide’s actors, actresses and technicians.
Tasker’s first production was Max
Frisch’s “Andorra” for which he brought
Reg Livermore from Sydney. Both pro-
ducer and star received justifiable kudos
for this impressive beginning. Next came
“West of the Black Stump”, produced by
Livermore and written.by him and Sandra
McKenzie. Ambitious and perhaps a
little thin, it was nevertheless popular and
ran to a successful country tour. The
image of both Tasker and his company
remained bright and buoyant; despite a
few abortive moments the venture was
well off the launching pad and destined
for an impressive orbit. And then he
decided to produce “Private Lives.”
Tasker answers criticism of this choice
by insisting that the Coward classic has
“a tremendous relevance to the ’sixties”.
He feels that in this age of the bewilder-
ing conquest of space, the ever-present
threat of an imminent holocaust and the
Vietnam crisis, people exhibit an under-
standable inclination to “shy away from
it all and be terribly gay”. He sees “Pri-
vate Lives” as “the ‘Virginia Woolf’ of the
’thirties”, but allows that some up-dating
was necessary. (“The clipped Coward
accents and the long cigarette-holders
have gone it would have been a mus-
eum piece.”) This done, says Tasker,
the play remains “outrageously funny”.
Certainly, audiences seemed to agree
and the play obviously retains consider-
able appeal for the general public, but,
despite Tasker’s convictions to the con-
trary, “Private Lives” is showing its age.
The production could be termed Coward
in Modern Dress because the promised
“up-dating” seems to be confined to the
costumes. There was nothing contempor-
ary about the heavy, fruity, sometimes
desperate over-acting of the cast. The
fierce, piercing projection of John Uni-
comb and Fernande Glyn in the leads
was unnecessary in the intimacy of
Theatre ’62. It could have been interest-
ing to see if Amanda and Elyot survived
as a 1960-type relationship but we will
never know.
Their playing never rose above the
level of a routine JCW farce; Tasker
and the Trust should be offering more
than that.
The next important move of The
South Australian Theatre Company will
be a physical one from Theatre ’62
(“in the wilds of suburbia”) to the new
Teachers’ College Theatre in the heart of
the city. This is one of the best-equipped
theatres in Australia with twin revolves,
air-conditioning, £50,000 of lighting
equipment and a capacity of 660. (v.
Theatre ’62 : 280.)
Tasker has this theatre for nine weeks
and is naturally anxious to finish his first
season on a note of spectacular achieve-
ment. The first choice was “The Rep-
resentative”, Rolfe Hochhuth’s great,
gruesome indictment of Pope Pius Xll’s
disinclination to speak against the Jewish
massacre of World War 11.
But in a strange and rather bewilder-
ing last-minute change of plans, Tasker
announced that “The Representative”
would not be his opening production at
Teachers’ College. Instead it will appear
later, possibly in November, possibly in
Union Hall.
On October 8 his production of “In-
admissible Evidence” will open at the
Teachers’ College. Tasker describes John
Osborne’s new play as “a tremendous
exploration into the problems of iden-
tity, existence and guilt”. The play’s
sexually frank dialogue, together with its
emotional impact, automatically pro-
vide ingredients for controversy and
combustion. Newcomer to Adelaide,
David Turnbull will play the massive
part of the tormented lawyer; Judith
Dick and Betty Lucas will play two of
his torments.
From the complexities and anxieties of
the immediate future, Tasker looks for-
ward to next year's Festival of Arts with
comparative certainty and considerable
optimism. He views “The Royal Hunt of
the Sun” as “the most exciting choice
ever for the Festival”. Peter Shaeffer’s
spectacular of “total theatre” based on the
16th century conquest of Peru by the
Spaniards has an all-male cast of 34,
many of whom must sing, dance and play
exotic musical instruments. Shaeffer’s
often cryptic directions are calculated to
turn strong producers weak by glibly
asking for such trifles as “The mime of
the crossing of the Andes”. The neces-
sity for “an 8-minute demonstration of
fantastic mime and movement” had
Tasker hurriedly seeking the services of
NIDA movement teacher Margaret
Barr. Miss Barr has worked with the
US’s Martha Graham, has had her own
group in England and, says a mightily
relieved Tasker, “is the best person in
Australia for the job”.
But the crossing of the Andes is only
one of Tasker’s immediate hazards. At
the expiry of his 9-week lease of the
Teachers’ College Theatre, his company
will have no home. Also, despite “e.X-


ceptional public response ”, his produc-
tions have inevitably lost a considerable
amount of money. Therefore, the alarm-
ing fact of the matter is that, come Christ-
mas, the South Australian Theatre Com-
pany could be broke and homeless.
Tasker insists the venture is in too deep
to allow any thoughts of withdrawal
indeed he is full of plans for expansion
Lunch-time theatre, children’s plays, late-
night revues are all projected. Next year
a Young Elizabethan Company will em-
anate from South Australia, for the first
time. Future city productions could in-
clude Moliere’s “Tartuffe”; John Whit-
ing’s “The Devils” (an exciting adapta-
tion of Aldous Huxley’s “The Devils ot
Loudun”); Alan Hopgood's “The Golden
Legion of Australian Cleaning Women”;
Chekhov’s “The Seagull” and, incredibly
(since it seems to have been done five
times in as many years), Wilde’s “The
Importance of being Earnest”.
Casting problems, Tasker fears, could
narrow this list. Nowhere in Australia can
he see a Grandier for “The Devils”
(Richard Johnson played it in London,
Jason Robards will play it on Broadway.
It is doubtful whether Tasker would have
cast either.) and “The Seagull’s” Madame
Arkadina remains equally elusive.
Tasker paints an imposing picture of
this possible future. Two things are neces-
sary for it to become a reality: South
Australians must come to the theatre and,
financially, someone must come to the
party.
THEATRE
The Average Sensual Man
Inadmissible Evidence. John Osborne. Old
Tote Theatre. Sydney.
'"lnadmissible Evidence” confirms that
John Osborne’s strength lies in
portraiture: full-length studies of his
contemporaries.
Ten years ago “Look Back in Anger”
exploded on the London stage and the
illumination showed the post-war gene-
ration of England to itself in the person
of Jimmy Porter. Now, ten years later,
Osborne has once again demonstrated
his remarkable ability to show “the very
age and body of the time his form and
pressure” in the character of Bill Mait-
land.
As the play begins, Maitland is dream-
ing that he is in the dock on trial for
the conduct of his life. He begins his
defence, which he has decided to under-
take for himself, with an incoherent
scramble of phrases such as daily as-
sault the conscientious readers of news-
paper editorials. Scraps of statistics,
sonorous cliches about science and
change and education and family life
tumble forth in a babble of high-sound-
ing nonsense, reminiscent of Lucky’s
speech in “Waiting for Godot”.
As he becomes more coherent, he
sketches his autobiography. He is a 39-
year-qld solicitor, a self-made man with
his own office in which he employs two
clerks, a secretary and a telephonist. He
has an attractive second wife, two well-
educated middle-class children, a house
with two bathrooms, and a sophisticated
mistress who is the daughter of a don.
It sounds like the portrait of a man
who is well endowed with love and mate-
rial possessions. But Bill Maitland is on
the verge of a nervous breakdown. He
drinks too much and this is beginning
to affect his work and his personal re-
lationships. Partly he imagines that
people are turning against him. partly
he invites rejection because he feels
guilty, and partly people are turning away
because they smell the odor of defeat.
Most of Jimmy Porters anger was
directed against the English class system.
But although Bill Maitland distinguishes
himself from the products of the public
schools “with their ringing, effortless voice
production” and “their fresh complex-
ions from their playing fields”, he never-
theless attributes his failure to reach the
bench to his lack of brilliance and not
to lack of opportunity. He describes him-
self as “irredeemably mediocre”. But
it is misleading to seize on this and say
that this is a play about a dullard. It is
better to think of him as the average
sensual man.
He does not scruple to cook up a bit
of evidence, but makes no secret of it.


He does not think the law and justice
are the same thing, anyway. He makes
love to the office girls, but only if they
are willing. He directs his scorn and
anger against people whose lives he con-
siders no more satisfactory than his own,
but who accept them without protest. He
despises people who conform because
they think it is not worth the candle to
do otherwise, for not having any pas-
sion or imagination.
Perhaps the most moving scene in the
play is that in which the lost, defeated
Maitland delivers a long monologue to
his 17-year-o!d daughter. It is a passion-
ate tirade against the young people of
today who have every material thing they
could want and complete freedom to do
as they please and who move among it
all with cool indifference and. as it
seems to their elders, without fear or
passion.
Peter O’Shaughnessy gives a perform-
ance of complete authority in the exceed-
ingly exhausting role of Bill Maitland.
The action of the play is set in Bill’s of-
fice. We see him at work during the
day with his staff, spending a drunken
night on the office sofa and waking to
a confused day in which his clients fade
into unreality as he broods on his own
problems. Throughout the play he does
not leave the stage.
Bill Maitland, like Jimmy Porter and
Archie Rice, is very firmly placed in
the England of the moment at which
the play was written. But Peter O’-
Shaughnessy wisely does not attempt to
reproduce an up-to-the-minute English-
man with the right provincial or lower-
class accent. Instead he gives us a care-
fully detailed portrait of a solicitor who
is convincingly a professional man and
also a human being on the edge of
breakdown.
This performance is a sustained ex-
ercise of the actor’s art in which every
movement and expression has been most
carefully- thought out to further the
development of the character.
As with Jimmy Porter, John Osborne
does not really explain the causes of
Maitland’s anger and defeat, but he
makes palpable a state of mind in which
the world seems a desert, love a delusion
and the will deflates like a punctured
tyre. But 1 can never quite believe in
the total defeat of John Osborne’s frus-
trated men of our time. There is so
much passion in their anger, and so
much vitality in the coloquial eloquence,
with which they rage against the world,
that it is hard to believe their defeat is
final: that they will not wake up to take
another hangover pill and deliver an-
other tirade.
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Humph!
Excuse I. Barry Humphries. Comedy
Theatre, Melbourne.
/"|ne hesitates to suspect a conspiracy,
but Australia’s robust, beer-swilled
humor seems endangered by trans-
vestism. Everywhere, “drag” is King,
if not Queen. When all else fails at
some nightclub or revue, a bloke in
drag is sure of a laugh. On TV, too (in
“Mavis”, “IMT”, etc.), the sight of a
male comic mincing in wig and high
heels and exploding the balloons up his
twin-set is all too familiar. But when it
comes to the first lady of female im-
personation, Barry Humphries’ Edna
Everage. things are very different. At
the Comedy the cries of laughter are
hard to separate from the cries of pain.
His monologue for Mrs Everage is
verbal pop-art, an impossible concen-
tration of brand names and suburban
catch-phrases often more nostalgic
than contemporary. Humphries does
not condescend to Mrs E. Like Thurber,
he is awed by female virility. Mrs
Everage is triumphant in her self-con-
fidence, energy and ultimate power, for
behind her sponge fingers is a mailed
fist. Her distaste for Asians is reflected
in our foreign policy, her moral stan-
dards give us our censorship, her visual
taste creates the Australian Ugliness.
Humphries cannot claim to have
created Mrs Everage. Rather, he isolated
and identified her six or seven years ago,
like the discovery of a virus, and, like a
virus, she quickly caught on. Before she
came on stage at the Comedy, the fear
was there that perhaps Mrs E. had out-
lived her usefulness, that she wouldn’t
be as funny any more. But while her
coin has been devalued a little, she retains
the vividness of an original. Her failing
is that she tends to overshadow
Humphries’ other characterisations.
Like Sandy Stone, who sits before us
in his dressing-gown, clutching his hottie,
and nodding off as he remembers Christ-
mas dinner. Older now, but no patriarch,
Sandy has been de-sexed by suburbia,
and has iong since yielded to the author-
ity of his Good Lady, the unseen Beryl.
Like the PR man Dodds, the bald-
headed wheeler-dealer simultaneously
directing the political careers of Sir
Robert and Arthur C. and those of
their respective heirs-apparent. Like the
young old-boy from one of the “greater
public schools” who fills us in on his sex
life with the snow-bunnies, and his State
school counterpart, a surfie who argues
that “chundering” is an art-form. And,
best of all, like the avant garde young
man Neil Singleton who appears in a
piece called “Neskafka”.
Some years ago Humphries was
criticised for leaving the intellectual
smart-set untouched. Now he has moved
rn, and knowing Eltham and Parkville!
just as intimately as Moonee Ponds, he
is devastating. We attend a mournful
party in a “vintage Larry Feidler” home
(with its “honest use of materials”) andi
drink “vino” while the young host
alienates all his guests with pretentious
patter. In ten minutes he conveys as
much bitterness and tragedy as did all
of “Virginia Woolf”.
In Victoria, at least, Humphries’ per-
formances have benefited from the
camaraderie of small audiences in such
off-beat venues as the late New Theatre
or Assembly Hall. Opening night at the
larger and more formal Comedy lacked
the spontaneity of those good old days,
but, in retrospect, it was even more a
triumph for Humphries.

Peruvian
Sweetnesses
Luigi Alva. Sydney Town Hall.
too often, artists in the international
circuit, the very ones most com-
monly offered to large managements
remote from the European scene, turn
out has-beens, artists with a great past
and well into their decline. Therefore, it
was very pleasing to welcome Peruvian
tenor Luigi Alva who is still a young
singer with a future and probably not
even quite at the peak of his vocal
development yet.
Before his opening Sydney recital, I’d
thought of Alva as just another Italian
tenor (his Peruvian origin was unknown
to me) with a growing operatic reputa-
tion. In the event, quite apart from not
being Italian at all, he was rather dif-
ferent. His voice is by no means a large
one, but is very sweet and excellently
controlled, sure in pitch and wholly
agreeable. Alva has a flair for exploiting
a good vocal line and his repertoire is
generally restricted to buffo arias, Italian
art songs and South American songs of
an easy popular appeal, ranging from
art songs to salon music.
Significantly, Alva’s only failure during
a varied and very well received recital
was in “Omhra mai fu” by Handel, which
calls for a big voice and a period style
w'hich simply is not Alva’s line. His
singing is bel canto, with the emphasis
on bel the production of beautiful
sound. There were moments when his
technique reminded me of Rossi at his
best and Jan Kiepura at his most sac-
charine, but, by and large, Alva proved
musicianly even in items that no one
could regard as being musically exalted.
The programme made only two seri-
ous excursions into the operatic reper-
toire. There was a splendidly-sung “Be-

co ridente” from the “Barber of Seville”
and a truly beautiful performance of
Ernesto's serenade “Come gentil” from
“Don Pasquale” sung in such a way
that, in the pauses between the bell-
clear notes, one could almost see the
deep blue night-sky shining through.
Gluck’s “O del mio dolce ardor” was
very beautiful but, considering its style,
almost too sweetly lyrical.
Far more important than the operatic
material were the little-known songs
from Alva’s native Peru. He gave us
four songs by his erstwhile teacher Rosa
Mercedes Morales, one by Clotilde Arias
and three by Fernando Obradors. Sung
in clearly enunciated Spanish, these are
songs with a good vocal line and of im-
mediate popular appeal. They are not
important musically no more so than
the earlier-heard songs by Bellini, Verdi,
Donizetti and Rossini, which were wholly
pleasing but they are in striking South
American musical idioms and, particular-
ly the Obradors ones, wonderful vehicles
for a singer with a penchant for rather
flamboyant lyricism. The best of them,
“Huiracocha” by Arias, is an invocation
to an Inca deity, a song worthy of inclu-
sion in anyone’s repertoire.
Luigi Alva was accompanied by
veteran Henri Penn, who was always
sympathetic and co-operative, undaunted
even by the very tricky Peruvian songs.
PAUL FROLICH
FILMS
Up to a Point
A High Wind In Jamaica. Director, Alex-
ander Mackendrick. Embassy Theatre,
Sydney.
\ little more boldness of approach
and this might have been an out-
standing film; as it is, it’s entertaining
enough but curiously unsatisfactory,
continually working up to a point which
it then tactfully avoids making.
It is the story of a group of children
who, on their way from Jamaica to Eng-
land and school, are captured almost in-
advertently by Caribbean pirates. After
undergoing their experiences, any adult
would either be dead or a gibbering
idiot, but children have a built-in survi-
val kit.. At the end of. the voyage, the
child Emily deliberately allows the pirate
captain to hang for a murder committed
by herself in a moment of panic. Emily
has been genuinely fond of the captain
and she is not a monster, but she has no
intention of “getting into trouble”.
Richard Elughes’ novel, with its un-
sentimental attitude to the workings of
children’s minds, is only slightly less
alarming than the later “Lord Of The
Flies”. Alexander Mackendrick in his
films has shown himself to be interested
in children, too “Mandy”, “Sammy
Going South” but his feeling seems
to be that they’re dear little things sadly
put-upon by fate and the nasty grown-
ups. So he never really faces Hughes’
argument squarely.
The film is either a romp with dis-
concertingly harsh interruptions, or a
serious drama treated too lightly.
Anthony Quinn is fine as the captain
and there’s a beautifully directed perfor-
mance by Deborah Baxter as Emily, and
Mackendrick does convey their equivocal,
never openly stated emotional relation-
ship with considerable subtlety. Douglas
Slocombe, one of England’s finest
cameramen, is not at the top of his
form; the photography is mostly a work-
manlike recording of events, with an
occasional bit of self-indulgence in pic-
ture-postcard shots of sails against
tropical skies.

BOOK
The Dragon and the Ants
By D. J. ENRIGHT
White Lotus. John Hersey. Hamish Hamil-
ton. 445. 6d.
A man of strong feelings and senii-
ments, John Hersey is drawn to
allegory, allegory which verges on par-
able, more direct and insistent than the
allegoricalness which resides in all art
worthy of the name, He is in no danger of
being mistaken for an aesthete; he means,
he means well, and he means intensely.
“The War Lover”, a fine novel, was mar-
red (if hardly appreciably) by Hersey’s
occasional “spelling out” of his thesis.
There is no need for the narrator to
tell us that Marrow, his pilot, “was a
destroyer ... in love with war”, and
“I could have no peace the world
could have none if men like him were
indulged in their passion.” For the grip-
ping. closely documented story of the
Flying Fortress and its crew presses home
the author’s message much more forcibly
than any moment of explicit comment
could.
Hersey’s last novel, “The Child Buyer”,
was more overtly allegorical, drawing on
science fiction, a genre eminently amen-
able to parable. It concerns United
Lymphomilloid, an American company
working on a top-secret government con-
tract, which buys up clever children,
cleanses them of their memories, feeds
them the relevant data, and then ties off
their five senses. As machines fed by
machines, they have the advantage over
conventional computers. which are
machines fed by human beings. “The
Child Buyer” is a fable about the State’s
usurpation of the private person, about
brain washing, and the readiness of some
educationists to see their function as the
production of “useful” citizens. Frighten-
ing as the novel is, it is likely to frighten
only those who are already alert to the
dangers it illustrates.
The parabolical element in Hersey’s
new novel, “White Lotus”, is so funda-
mental and pervasive that only a very
considerable creative writer one who
can convey experiences which then con-
vey their own significance to the reader
no matter how strong his resistance
only such a writer could hope to keep
the novel afloat and the reader awake.
The theme of “White Lotus” is first of
all the condition of the Negro in Amer-
ica from the time of the slave-traders
up to the present. But Hersey doesn’t
want to write yet another book about
Uncle Tom or about James Baldwin.
He aims to tell the story a way
that the white reader is reading about
himself as a slave, about whites as nig-
gers. So, leaning on science fiction again,
he sets his novel in a “might-have-been”
past: it is to be the “tale of an old shoe
on a new foot”.
America has been defeated in war by
China Imperial China and the
American heroine is kidnapped, sold into
slavery and transported to China. We
understand straightaway that America
means Africa, and China, America
and that “white” means black and “yel-
low”, white. The correspondence is close,
only too close, and sustained. The
“whites” are bought and sold, they have
no right under the law. They tend to
religious hysteria tinged with voodoo.
They are superstitious, emotional, given
to drunkenness, gambling, hymn-singing
and dancing. Sexually they are uncom-
plicated and informal, and their owners
condone their “animalistic” behavior
(while nervously envying it) because it
produces more slaves. Their attitude
towards their masters is one of outward
obsequiousness and inward contempt.
They regard with suspicion those “yellows”
who profess an admiration for their
“innocent childish hearts” or their folk-
lore. Some of them aspire to “yellowness”
while others are consciously and reso-
lutely “white”. Later in the story some
of the more sophisticated “white” girls
have their curly hair straightened or pro-
cure through eye-surgery the coveted
epicanthic folds. There is even a thinly
disguised Ku-Klux-Klan-
This continuous translating of “white”
into “black” is exasperating, and par-
ticularly so in the first hundred pages or
more, while the novel (700 pages in all)
is getting into its epic stride. The author’s
attitude is very correct, of course, very
worthy. His sentiments do him credit —
JOHN HERSEY
but what are they doing to his fiction?
Alas, les bons sentiments font la mauvaise
litterature . . . But wait, what is hap-
pening on the other side of the
color bar? A similarly mechanical trans-
lation of “yellow” into “white”? No.
For it seems that the “yellows” cannot
be turned back into “whites”, Hersey’s
China and Chinese remain obdurately
China and Chinese, no simple equation
Z equals A, Y equals B can operate
here. The Meridian Gate of the For-
bidden City just isn’t to be located in
America. The mandarins, the Confucian
precepts, the bound feet, the yamen, the
slit-gowns, the kite-flying, the readings
from Li Po and Tu Fu, the landscape
itself this yellowness cannot be trans-
muted into American whiteness. Hersey
knows too much about China, is too
interested in China, to be able to use
it as a Lilliput or Brobdignag, as a mere
reflecting device.
And so the allegorical technique,
clumsy to begin with, has now broken
down. Yet, by one of those glorious para-
doxes which will always frustrate the
literary lawgiver, this is what saves the
novel, and enables it to triumph. Because
the Chinese are intransigently Chinese,
and “yellow” cannot be back-translated
into “white”, so the reader no longer
feels obliged and no longer feels able
to keep reminding himself that “white”
really means “black”. The bonds of alle-
gory are not too difficult to snap but
now we are truly trapped within the story,
in the cogently detailed and fascinating
documentation of men’s lives, and the
thesis is universalised. Because of what
has gone before, and because of Flersey’s
masterly tact, it cannot be read as simply
an attack on China. No, this is what has
happened when people of differing cult-
ures have lived side by side, not as equals
but as masters and slaves. It could hap-
pen to us.
The history of the Negro from the
blackbirds to the Alabama marchers is
Pao Yu
I am surprised by topaz-amber eyes.
Pao Yu, black cat with little pointed teeth
Hunts beneath the dark orange tree.
Pao Yu, black tail aloft, is a dreamer
He seeks hidden alleys between the fat
oranges.
Cat-like- he distrusts obvious things, loud
Footsteps, vulgar laughter, affections,
He condescends to be stroked Sultan-like
By female hands, takes a little sweet wine
From my finger-tip, sometimes purrs;
sleeps;
But loves the velvet mysterious night,
Dark and silent, under the quiet orange
tree.
I am surprised by topaz-amber eyes.

compressed into a few years of narrative.
White Lotus is fifteen years old at the
beginning and a desirable young woman
at the close. The episodes of her story
each illustrate one form of Negro (though
not exclusively Negro) resistance re-
sort to criminality, to religiosity, to
flight, to organised violence. White Lotus
escapes from the slave States to those
provinces, loyal to the weak Imperial
government, where slavery has been
abolished. She finds her way to Shanghai,
“City of wonder! City of modern times!”,
marvellously depicted, where “whites”
are free, free to live in the swarming
slums of “the Enclave”, the city’s “night-
soil heap”, and free to work, to work as
ricksha boys, wharf coolies or house
servants. But the barriers are crumbling.
Young “white” poets and “white” dancers
are taken up by “yellow” society, a
“white” girl and a “yellow” man can
occasionally feel real respect and affec-
tion for each other, and here and there
“whites” are working alongside “yellows”.
The novel ends with White Lotus, in the
Sleeping-Bird posture, confronting Gov-
ernor K’ung. Hersey has found a form of
non-violent resistance splendidly apt in a
“face” society: “We all stood on one leg,
with bowed heads, peaceable, vulnerable,
utterly reproachful.” This is the beginning
of a new phase in the struggle. As police
drag away the Sleeping Birds, White
Lotus has a thought which fills her with
inexplicable fear. “What if some day we
are the masters and they are the under-
dogs?”
Good sentiments, given a good writer,
can make good literature after all. At all
events they are more likely to do so
than bad sentiments or no sentiments
at all. It is only the man of goodwill liv-
ing in seclusion, taking his sentiments
for granted, who will be inclined to sup-
pose that sentiments don’t matter. Those
who live in the world know that good
sentiments, honestly and firmly held to,
are not all that common. And neither are
novels like “White Lotus”.
Judith Wright’s Insights
By ALEXANDER PORTEOUS
Preoccupations In Australian Poetry. Judith
Wright. Oxford University Press, Mel-
bourne. 525. 6d.
Tudith Wright is a critic of great gifts,
at once sensitive and shrewd, gener-
ous and clear-sighted. Her new book
amply displays these qualities; and not
only in relation to individual poets and
their works, but also, and most excitingly,
in combination with a largeness and
sureness of vision that enables her to
grasp the essential influences and issues
moving in a whole epoch.
The result is a book that gives us
many individual comments of the great-
est value, indeed; but which provides
also a unique and invaluable conspectus
of nineteenth-century Australian poetry
as a whole. Indeed, I must go farther,
and claim that such is its sureness of
touch and profundity of insight that it
constitutes almost a general cultural his-
tory of the period. And not only so far
as Australia is concerned: the book sets
nineteenth-century poetry firmly in the
context of the whole development of
English poetry in the period something
attempted all too seldom in Australian
criticism.
Thus, in discussing Harpur’s valiant
and far from absurd attempts to found
a poetic tradition that would be authen-
tically Australian and not merely imitative
of English modes and attitudes, Judith
Wright makes the telling point that “the
poetic mid-Victorianism of Tennyson and
Swinburne was probably the most unsuit-
able influence for Australian poets that
could be imagined.” And one finds that
Mrs McKinney’s discussion throws valu-
able light on the state of English poetry
at the time.
• The first part of the book, as these
comments may suggest, is very good
indeed. On Harpur and Kendall, Judith
Wright achieves near-definitive authority
of judgment. This is critical advocacy
of the best kind, the enabling criticism
that sends one eagerly back to the poems
themselves with renewed sympathy and
sharpened appetite. (In this connection
it is good to know that an edition of
Harpur is in prospect.) These founding
grandfathers of Australia’s poetic tradi-
tion have been too often felt to be
embarrassing progenitors for whom one
makes a plea in mitigation, perhaps, but
who could net withstand stringent
evaluation; here we have them evaluated
with a critical finesse that recognises all
the embarrassments, but firmly points
out that they achieved much of real and
lasting merit, and not merely of his-
torical or iocal interest.
The same strengths are evident in the
discussion of Adam Lindsay Gordon,
Boake and the “Reformist” poets, Law-
son and O'Dowd. Here Mrs McKinney’s
discriminations and qualifications again
demonstrate an alert and balanced critical
consciousness; and again the wider scene
is sensitively appealed to; Kipling and
Henley, for instance, are called in to
point the special nature in the sentimen-
tality and bombast of much of Lawson’s
verse; so again the Symbolists are ap-
pealed to in the difficult and testing case
of Brennan, in defining with equal firm-
ness and sympathy the basic weaknesses
that make Brennan finally less than a
major poet, on whom Mrs McKinney is
nothing short of brilliant.
The Brennan chapter however, marks
a point of change in the procedure cf
the book: in the cases both of the early
modern poets (Hugh McCrae and Shaw
Neilson), and the contemporary poets
she selects for treatment (Slessor, Fitz-
gerald, McAuley, Hope, John Blight,
Francis Webb), the effortless confidence
and the authentically magisterial quality
which have marked the first half of the
book give way to something less certain


and less weighty. Increasingly, in these
later chapters Mrs McKinney, in the
nature of things, can be seen to align
herself in defined (and hence limited)
positions in relation to debates and con-
troversies that are still urgent in Aus-
tralian letters. Thus, she very well dis-
tinguishes both the fey charm and the
emotional and moral deficiencies of
McCrae’s implied view of the world and
of persons:
“Women are either kissed or killed.
When something happens, in Mc-
Crae’s poetry it is something violent;
knives are drawn on the other side
of the rose-trellis”;
but does not go on to consider the full
implications of this, and leaves herself
in the position of implying a judgment
which is clearly too high in view of the
damaging flaws and limitations she her-
self has tellingly adduced.
Again, the choice of two younger poets
and no others for extended discussion
narrows the scope and restricts the force
of her final chapters; to dismiss Evan
Jones, Ronald Simpson and Chris
Wallace-Crabbe as authors of “slightly
academic and suburban poems” makes
an impression of cheapness that jars
painfully after so much memorable and
impeccably just comment and Vincent
Buckley rates here only a parenthetical
reference to a single critical article.
It is in its discussion of the two most
distinguished of contemporary Australian
poets that the book is weakest. Mrs
McKinney is clearly out of sympathy
with the poetic stance and demeanor
of both Hope and McAuley, although
in the case of the former she does con-
clude with a generous tribute to his
passionale and visionary power (and has
other discerning praise to award him on
the way). In the case of McAuley, how-
ever, her sympathy fails for precisely the
reason that it rises to meet successfully
JUDITH WRIGHT
the challenge of Hope’s poetry. Like
some other critics, Judith Wright sees
McAuley as denying, in the name of an
imposed and external order intellectu-
ally submitted to, primal feeling and
response; she speaks of “the imposed
order of the intellect”, of a “failure of
sympathy in McAuley himself” in con-
fronting the modern world. In this last
instance she surely mis-reads the critical
and philosophical essays she is referring
to (those found in “The End of Mod-
ernity”, where McAuley is surely
denouncing a false and limited cult of
the modem which would reject too much
of the painfully won achievement of the
past, instead of absorbing it into a true
acceptance of the best of both past and
present). She also mistakes the nature of
the growing lucidity and poise of Mc-
Auley’s lyrics in “A Vision of Ceremony”
and subsequently, seeing these qualities
as wilfully enforced at the expense of
passional truth. Here (as sometimes else-
where) she surely shows a limiting pre-
ference for the tenseness of feeling, the
barely contained anguish evident, indeed,
in so much modern poetry; but it is pos-
sible both to recognise the worth of good
poems of that kind and at the same
time to applaud the strongly worked
lucidity, the authentically achieved sim-
plicity (comparable in some respect with
similar qualities in such a poet as George
Herbert) that mark McAuley’s best
lyrics. Yet when all is said this remains
a book to applaud.
The Fuss About Smut
By DAVID MARTIN
Obscene. Ludwig Marcuse. Mac Gibbon &
Kee. 89s.
Professor Marcuse (we are not told
what he is a professor of psychol-
ogy? Philosophy or literature?) subtitles
his diatribe “The History of Indignation”.
He waxes mightily indignant at the idio-
cies and fallacies which, age after age,
have underlain the concept of obscenity
and pornography; in other words the
verbal aphrodisiac. Unfortunately his
own publisher has obviously been unable
to grasp his main argument.
“Like most men,” says the blurb, “he
is opposed to smut for its own sake, but
finds that the defenders of the ‘obscene’
are often just as confused as its attack-
ers,” The second part of the statement is
true Marcuse despises, and justly,
the noble souls, be they bishops or
writers, who try to rescue Flaubert,
Lawrence and Miller by taking them into
the protective custody of their own irra-
tional morality. But he is not opposed
to smut for its own sake because he recog-
nises how difficult it is to define, and
because he acknowledges its uses, at least
indirectly. He also knows that nothing
exists for its own sake, be it art or smut.
In trial after trial the rescuers have
Professor Zinn Watches a Storm by the Sea
Whinnying through his spittle, like the sea,
The white horse hooves against
The lightning-struck cloud split pig-blood
red.
He does not understand electricity,
And is, therefore, irrational.
He raves foaming to the far fence, trying
To shake loose the rider who is not there,
The sweat in his ears pricks him.
Never has he been beyond that fence. He
kicks it
And recoils. Not tricked gentleness nor
hurt love
Soften his eyes. Poor beast, he has no one
to hate.
If I copld only explain about electricity.
He stands cloaked within a great oak tree;
His nostrils, opening like the mouths of
bass on sand,
Burn with forced patience.
That is a mistake he should not stand
beneath the tree!
It conducts electricity, especially when wet.
In the slobber of wind: leaves, branches,
Are the hair, the arms, of a woman who
has lost control of herself.
She screams: GO, GO, I WILL NEVER
FORGIVE YOU!
There is no need for such behavior.
Lightning has lopped the tree. I told you
so.
Breaking past the fence, he runs as if
roped, free over the field,
Through the gnarled, angry underbrush
at the cliff’s edge.
Kicking toward heaven, over and over
he rolls down.
His belly bare as a stone in the next
lightning-flash.
He rises on the beach, stares for an instant,
whinnys at the sea
Then goes galloping without direction.
COME BACK, DUMB BEAST, COME
BACK, COME BACKS
In the electrical light, I see his hoof
Splatter a washed-up squid
Like the thick-haired head of a doll.

been as insincere as the prosecutors.
They have tried to prove, completely
without purpose, that the maligned
author is a moralist, a Christian, a decent
citizen; that he cannot be obscene be-
cause he is an artist, that the assailed
passages are not typical for the book as
a whole, and so on, ad nauseam. Except
for Baudelaire, who conceded everything
because he thought the whole fuss too
silly, and for Henry Miller (“the coarsest
humanist whom the world has seen”),
who will not call a cock a chicken, even
the poor writers have played the game
according to its phoney rules. For, of
course, they mean to produce a total re-
sponse in the reader, which includes the
physical, just as their absorption in their
own work is total and includes the physi-
cal.
They celebrate the body, if not always
well and not always as Marcuse thinks.
He is wrong about Lawrence who was
no celebrant in any way. If they permit
themselves to be made parties to the lie
that sex cannot be good without love they
are more often than not untrue to what
their books or plays say. They are interest-
ed in the sexual because it is so greatly a
part of life, not because it comes from
God or because it is “beautiful”. It can
be horrible, and when they present its
horror they do not do it to create beauty
but to portray reality: and here there is
perhaps a distinction between poet and
novelist which the author has over-
looked.
The indignation is common to de-
fender and accuser because they accept
the same premises. If you study the evi-
dence in the “Lady Chatterley” case you
will see that, from E. M. Forster to Re-
becca West, all are agreed that the novel
would be bad if the charge of the Crown
were sustained they merely claim it
cannot be sustained because of Law-
rence’s artistic intentions. One famous
witness avowed that Lawrence, by his
repetitious use, had, so to speak, decon-
taminated the four-letter word; yea, rob-
bed it of its dreaded potency. But who
wants to do that? Certamly not many
intelligent writers, with Lawrence a pos-
sible exception. He really didn’t like the
body, however much he protested. This
book shows how some of the allegedly
free spirits, particularly Goethe, were
arrant hypocrites when it came to the
point; how they hedged and how they
would not face what they and their col-
leagues were up to. The old sage does
not come too well out of the controversy
around Schlegel’s “Lucinde”, though bet-
ter than Schiller, that great revolutionary
who wrote a poem (nicely sadistic) in
favor of flogging courtesans.
Marcuse, writing in German in Cali-
fornia, labors the point that the indig-
nant virtuous ones are angry because
they are afraid of what bubbles within
themselves. His finest specimen of the
type is the unspeakable Comstock who
drove some of his victims into the grave
and at whom Shaw had a fine go. But
that’s old hat. He ought to have delved
more deeply and demonstrated that the
fear is of still vaster proportions. Bris-
bane dentists and Victorian Attorneys-
General shudder before the spectre of
chaos a word they like but cannot
understand. Birth and death are also
“chaotic”, however we try to domesticate
them; and sex, whether for procreation
or not, is notoriously unruly. They want
rules and proclaim that they equate with
civilised progress. As if there were no H-
bomb and no deepening, world-wide des-
pair. Naturally, they never explain why
the rules allow the depiction of murder,
a staple in all literatures, but not of the
many forms of sex. Is murder, maybe,
an acceptable substitute for coition in
literature? Nothing apparently happens
to anyone but Karamazov when his head
is battered in, but to allow Grushenka
a twitch below the waist would lead to
. . . what?
And here Professor Marcuse’s cour-
age fails the test. He hints, he implies
and he thunders. He mentions fantasy,
and admits that it belongs, that it is
integral to the whole process of enjoy-
ment in any field whatever. Why does
he not say that the more effectively a
work stimulates fantasy, the more it
arouses us to participation, the more
successful it is all round? “Lucinde”,
and Mark Twain’s celebrated indecency
at the court of an English queen, may
stimulate fantasy in one way, and a girlie
magazine in another. The latter may only
stimulate masturbation fantasies and
that is what it is mainly bought for. One
produces one kind of auto-eroticism, the
other a different kind. The unspoken as-
sumption behind the assault on stimula-
tion in art is that it can become inartistic
stimulation. But then it remains to be
proved that inartistic stimulation is un-
healthy, which is unprovable. Life was
no happier or safer in Calvin’s Geneva
than in Messalina’s Rome.
The issue, even as Marcuse dissects
it, is bedevilled by the idea of “taste”.
A bad writer can write in bad taste about
anything but there are no subjects
that are more in bad taste than others.
The taboos exist simply because sex is
such an explosive and masterful complex
of emotions. I believe what most people
have in mind when they charge erotic
writing as being in bad taste is that it
outrages the sense of shame. But to out-
rage shame is a stable datum in sexu-
ality, essential to its power and attrac-
tion. It comes back to this: that some
cannot bear to admit the outrageous in
their psyche because, order rejecting
chaos, their humanity rejects their
animalism. (It can’t, but it tries.) Bad
taste often serves as synonym for
aborted self-knowledge.
This work is worth possessing for two
things. It informs us on the cosmopoli-
tanism of prudery, with emphasis on
Germany, though it is too strong on
oratory and too short on facts. It is
most brilliant in its treatment of Henry
Miller, a great and fearless artist about
whom I have read nothing better. Pro-
fessor Marcuse’s seven theses on how to
disarm indignation are too metaphysical
and leave me unmoved. Anyhow, you
can’t disarm indignation. You have to
ignore it.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Old Monetary Tunes
As the International Monetary Fund
settles down to its ruminations in
Washington, long-seasoned cynics all
over the world will still be sceptical
about anything emerging on the stimula-
tion of international liquidity. Year
after year the same old problems appear
to afflict international trade the suf-
ficiency of its monetary base, the status
of the reserve currencies, the widening
gap between industrial and commodity-
producing countries.
Year after year such problems of
principle appear to get shelved. The
world monetary system staggers on
with a series of clever expedients, many
of them under the aegis of the great
national central banks.
This year, at least, the American
Secretary of the Treasury, Mr Henry
Fowler, has sounded out a number of
European countries on monetary reform.
The Paris Club (the Group of Ten) and
the Ossala research team have both
“explored” fundamental alternatives to
existing currency devices. Yet support,
or even tacit approval of some change, is
lacking from an extremely important
financial power France.
Britain and America have each lately
been wrestling with difficulties tending
to detract from esteem for their cur-
rencies, which is, for sterling, putting it
somewhat mildly. Just before the IMF
talks were to begin, President Johnson
was again forced to deplore the dollar
outflow and to infer that many in-
dustrial corporations were not co-operat-
ing in the national balance-of-payments
rescue operation. However fortunate
US capital inflow may be for Australia,
the long-term strength of the dollar is
equally basic.
The British Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, Mr James Callaghan, did not
bring much comfort or novelty to the
pre-IMF Commonwealth Economic Con-
ference. His generalities played the same
old tunes: how urgent was additional
international liquidity; should the pound
and the dollar retain their standing;
could Britain help more international
development.
Tobacco Road
TO/hatever new rules the Federal Gov-
ernment lays down on tobacco leaf
imports into Australia will still leave
plenty of problems within the local
growing industry. The stabilisation or
support scheme, which actually began
with the latest auction series, appears to
have brought little satisfaction to many
growers. Nor, apparently, has it suc-
ceeded in establishing the atmosphere to
resolve differences between growers and
manufacturers.
Briefly, the manufacturers are sup-
posed to buy all the Australian crop, pay-
ing an average price of 125 d. a lb., with
certain allowances being made in terms
of leaf quality. The just-finished auctions
saw them bid for well under the total
crop.
Only a week or so ago, a group of
Italian tobacco farmers walked off their
share farms in northern NSW and
southern Queensland. Such a form of
JAMES CALLAGHAN
protest is almost a regular occurrence—
many smaller share-farmers, mostly
Italians, Greeks and Spaniards, have left
their farms after failing to sell their leaf,
or selling it at very low' prices.
Those who have been quitting are
growers who started share-farming after
earning enough in several seasons of
cane-cutting to get established. Victoria
experienced violence at last year’s
auctions; in May last, similar threats
were made at Northgate, in Brisbane,
and sales had to be cancelled.
The chairman of the Southern Queens-
land Tobacco Growers’ Co-operative As-
sociation, Mr A. Agostinelli, believes so
many growers will leave the industry that
next year’s crop will be down by 20 p.c.
Some growers go so far as to argue that
the cigarette makers wish to destroy the
stabilisation scheme and are not honest
in their oft-repeated complaints about
poor-quality leaf.
Mr R. A. Irish, the chairman of Roth-
mans of Pall Mall (Australia), once more
referred to the running debate in his
latest annual report. The stabilisation
.plan, he said, “seems to provide a frame-
work for future development on sound
lines. This depends, however, on quality
being recognised as the main objective,
and on prudent administration which is
fair to the seller and the buyer . .
Retailing Patterns
Qydney retailers have come under a
critical eye in view of city shut-downs
(Marcus Clark, Bebarfalds) plus constant
reminders that the retail trend is towards
the suburbs.
Of the most recent profit results for
the 1964-65 year, Grace Bros’ and
Farmers’ record earnings could largely
have been expected. Both companies
are known to do well at their differently
located, but still “city” establishments;
both have taken skilfully - conceived
moves into the suburbs.
But it has certainly been widely ac-
cepted that those companies which are
struggling against earlier, heavy re-
versals in the city proper will find it a
particularly hard job to find the way
to recovery. The continuously success-
ful giants go from strength to strength.
Hence the profit recovery by Bucking-
hams £td (now operating nine stores, in-
cluding Curzons in the city) deserves a
closer look. The conclusion is that the
established pattern is being followed
out of the city and concentrating on sub-
urban and country selling.
The company showed a whacking
consolidated loss of £253,256 in the pre-
vious year, when £461,000 in bad debts
was written off. The latest result to July
31 still required the writing-off of about
£150,000 in bad debts, but the company
was able to come up with a consolidated
profit of £31,270.
Known previously in the retail trade
as a credit operator with important door-
to-door sales, Buckinghams now' claims
that perhaps only 20 p.c. of its business
is door-to-door. Salesmen in this division
have been cut from 124 to 109 and rigid
procedures established where the para-
mount policy is credit control rather than
sales at all costs.
With the drive towards cash retail sales,
more emphasis is given to suburban shop-
pers and a new departmental store was
opened during the year at Manly. It
appears that Liverpool is still operating at
a loss, but a new store at Warrawong
(Port Kembla, NSW) is said to be
proving profitable.
Apart from the growing tendency of
certain people to avoid their debts, it
seems that greater attention must be
directed towards selling the public what
it can afford to repay.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The Vernon Committee’s
Objective Analysis
Home truths on the economy
A GOVERNMENT which has long been preening itself on its economic policies
could hardly have been expected to welcome the Vernon Committee’s monumental
report, whose main conclusions not only run counter to them in many respects but
also include the recommendation to set up an economic advisory body to oversee them.
The curious aspect to me is that, while
the Vernon Report goes for the highest
possible growth rate consistent with
minimising economic fluctuations —or
maximising employment, which is more
or less the same thing this is precisely
what the Government itself has been
trying to do, and pretty successfully, for
a long time.
I wouldn’t argue that it is w'rong to
recommend a growth rate of five p.c.,
which incidentally is a fraction less than
the Government’s own objective ex-
pressed at the last election. I should
point out, however, that the recently
issued economic prospectus for Britain,
prepared by the Department of
Economic Affairs, goes for only four p.c.
Such target rates are in qny case more
of interest to academic economists,
especially when set for countries whose
economic fortunes are as dependent on
overseas economic influences as our own
and Britain's. The real question to my
mind is whether, in pursuit of any par-
ticular growth rate, economic policies
are also geared to minimise economic
fluctuations That was the philosophy
behind the Vernon Committee’s approach
and it is to be highly commended.
Ironically, the main complaint about
the DEA Report in Britain was that,
though it set detailed industrial growth
targets as well as one for the economy
overall, it stopped short of recommend-
ing ways to achieve the targets. Here
the main complaint about the Vernon
Report by the Government is that it
shows the way to achieve the postulated
objectives.
The committee has got to the main
roots of what will determine the future
growth possibilities the availability of
resources overall and in particular, and
the availability of capital, as seen against
the structural background of the economy
in which these resources have to be
deployed.
Of most immediate moment, perhaps,
is its finding that the bulging into the
work force of mounting numbers of teen-
agers in the next five years is going to
pose very big problems of labor absorp-
tion. These problems were highlighted
by notable economists like Sir Douglas
Copland about the time the Vernon Com-
mittee got its commission in 1962, but
have since been underplayed by the
return to full employment. It is as well
to have then brought to the front of
the Government’s attention now, when
it is still wrapped in the problems of
labor scarcity. It was equally right for
the Vernon Committee to look at this
'problem of future labor absorption in
relation to immigration. Everybody
knows what happened in 1962 on that
front. All that the committee has done
is to alert the Government that un-
employment may again become a prob-
lem unless immigration is limited to its
current rate, which incidentally is about
the highest we’ve ever achieved.
Perhaps we shouldn’t read too much
into the dismissal of large numbers of
employees by General Motors-Holden’s
last week, yet it could be symptomatic
SIR JAMES VERNON
of what may be pending in several other
industries. As I mentioned last week,
Sir Colin Syme has pointed to some
slackening in demand for steel, ACl’s
chairman to a similar trend in its various
industries. Demand for housing has also
receded. So, in warning the Govern-
ment that a pause towards even higher
immigration is warranted in the interests
of teenage labor absorption, the com-
mittee's recommendation may yet be
justified on the immediate possibilities
for employment a matter discussed in
this column two weeks back.
On the availability of capital, the
report doesn’t let its reservations about
the future of Australian exports and the
postulated strain of imports’ growth deter
it from warning that a future price will
have to be paid for continuing to enjoy
the luxury of high unrestricted capital
inflow. This price, it suggests, would
have to be paid both in inflation and
pressures on the balance of payments.
The committee’s lengthy display of
statistical postulations and polemics on
this front have obviously been too much
for the Prime Minister and economists
in his administration. Nor, even admit-
ting that one would look to exports in-
creasing at a faster rate and the income

altogether convinced that even statisti-
cally has the committee clinched its case
favoring the limitation of overseas in-
vestment to about its present rate of £l5O
miilion a year.
On the other hand, in drawing atten-
tion to the need to step up local savings,
the committee is definitely on the right
track and nobody in the Government will
disagree. Unfortunately, however, in its
desire for more local capital, the com-
mittee takes the strict economic interpre-
tation, thinking that forced savings by
way of increased taxation is just as good
a way of increasing local capital supplies
as by voluntary effort. I should have
thought a committee with three out of
five members businessmen would have
been more realistic. Obvsously, when the
chips w'ere down, there was a general
agreement that the development of Aus-
tralia would have to be accomplished
more at the sacrifice of the standard of
living of the inhabitants and less from
purses of overseas capitalists,
Naturally, those two peculiarly Aus-
tralian institutions, the Tariff Board and
the Arbitration Commission, which have
such a telling influence on the shape of
the economic structure, were brought
under close scrutiny by the committee,
The conclusions reached are logical,
given the committee’s general thesis that
we must work to get a more rational
economy. The discussion on the Tariff!
Board echoed the recently expressed
thoughts of Mr Boyer that the boardj
should give more consideration to the
broad effects of its decisions on the!
economy. Equally the report said the!
Arbitration Commission should cease to'
delude itself that it was merely settling)
industrial disputes and should take cog-
nizance of the fact that its awards had
an important general economic effect.
The majority judgment in this year’s
wage hearings showed the commission
itself is coming round to the same view.
Speaking about the Reserve Bank, the
report looks for more frequent, full and
frank public statements _on monetary
conditions and problems to which they
give rise. While admittedly Dr Coombs
has been rather less discursive in his
public statements this last year or two,
I cannot doubt that, even if as the report
says his behavior in the 1960 boom left
something to be desired, he is now firmly
on the ball.
On banking and credit in general the
committee saw the need for another
more detailed investigation and put for-
ward its suggestion in seemingly very
moderate terms. “The importance of the
operations of the credit system to the
development of the economy is so great
that, in our opinion, the subject war-
rants a full-scale study in its own right.”
The Prime Minister knocked this
approach on the head when opening the
new ANZ Bank building in Sydney.
Referring to the structure established by
the 1959 Acts, he added: “We would
not like to see this disturbed and a lot
of passions raised by an enquiry into the
system.”
This enormously voluminous report
takes us into every corner of the
economy. Even if it is not acceptable to!
this Government, it will be extremely!
useful not only as a sounding board for
the effectiveness of present policies and
the formation of new ones, but also
for business reference. Unfortunately,
practically nobody outside the Govern-
ment and the Press has seen it, let alone
read its well-documented 1841 pages.


What goes on at Hamersley ?
(An industry in the making.)
As you can see, it is moving off the drawing board into reality.
By 1966 there will be an open cut mine on Mt. Tom Price, the largest single
occurrence of massive hematite so far found in the Hamersleys, containing more than
500 million tons of 64% Fe grade. From it 180 miles of railway line will run to a
new port at King Bay equipped to handle 65,000-ton ships. Mine, line and ships
will supply Japan with 65 million tons of iron ore, during the next 16 years.
Australian skills and initiative will be called on to complete, on schedule, this
huge project that will mean greater employment and more foreign exchange for Australia.

Market Research in Australia
Banishing hunches about consumption
"We're convinced that
some people watch TV
and some don't."
By VICTOR WORSTEAD
TN a high-wage, full-employment industrial economy, like Australia, the consumer
becomes the centre of a continuous and massive producer attention. The reasons
why he chooses certain products, and the attempt to change his mind, are a major
preoccupation of the marketers.
Gone, or rapidly going, are the
straightforward days of hunch and guess-
work. Or, at least, that is the claim of
modern market research coupled, in
Australia, with the charge that market
research’s discoveries and certainties 1 of
procedure are insufficiently used.
Many fly-by-night and grossly inexpert
survey agencies have operated through-
out Australia. This is one of the reasons
why many merchants still regard the
whole strategy with suspicion.
One market research officer said that
each time the Sydney and Melbourne
“pink pages” are printed they contain
the names of between 50 and 60 market
research agencies; by the next year, he
claimed, half of these names will have
disappeared and been replaced by
others. He conceded there were “two or
three” first-class independent market sur-
vey agencies in Australia, but said there
were many more people doing high-class
work within big companies.
Market research is open to anyone.
There are no laws to set qualifications or
methods of operating. Membership'of
the Market Research Society is open to
anyone, for example, who is in charge
of research; in some cases, a market re-
searcher said, this may be a clerk who is
in charge of research in an advertising
agency “because there is no one else
handy”. Membership of the Statistical
Society is open only to graduates.
There is nothing yet the exact equiva-
lent of the British Market Research
Society,. which vets membership closely.
Business houses then requiring a re-
search project can apply to the Society
- for a list of members or to check the
qualifications and standing of a particu-
lar market research agency.
Yet the better Australian organisations
survive and do well, in spite of the doubt-
ful fringe. The skilled market research
agency can discover what the public
wants, enabling the right goods to be
stocked; it can place the range of pos-
sible prices so that saleable qualities and
brands are stocked. It can probe people’s
wants at present not catered for, and
can examine overall industrial and busi-
ness trends. Another function, naturally,
is to reveal what competitors are offer-
ing.
One of the more prominent local agen-
cies, the McNair Survey Pty Ltd, finds
no trouble in listing 30-odd research
fields “in which McNair experience can
help you”. These range from brand share
of a market, brand loyalty and product
uses to market patterns, buying motives,
consumer attitudes and personality char-
acteristics, brand likes and dislikes, and
“the underlying reasons”. The agency ex-
tends its testing to all advertising media,
to television and radio audiences, to
newspaper and magazine readership. It
will pre-test new products, packaging and
advertising layout. It will take into ac-
count political and economic factors.
Mr William A. McNair, the senior
director, has his claims quite pat. “Mar-
ket research is primarily designed to test
the consumer’s response to advertising
and selling, as distinct from product re-
search, which is designed to test what
appeals,” he says. “Often market re-
search, will come up with only a verifi-
cation of what a company suspected, but
businessmen are now realising that it is
better to have suspicions confirmed than
unchecked.”
The last sentence echoes through
much of the voluminous literature on
the methods of market surveying. The
amount of absolutely new knowledge,
in spite of refinements of technique, may
riot be particularly great; yet it is bet-
ter to have some moderately certain link
between management and customer.
Another Australian market surveyor,
Mr Bob March, of B. E. Thomason Re-
search Pty Ltd, maintains that one of
the reasons for the slow development
of market research in Australia is a
widespread lack of understanding of it.
“The research companies have a job
persuading people that they should use
market research.” Australian activities
are still inadequate when compared with
both theory and practice overseas. “Most
of the local trends are imported by com-
panies such as Colgate-Palmolive, Gen-
eral Motors, Lever and Kitchen, whibh
have their own research divisions apply-
ing techniques developed overseas,” Mr
March says. “For instance, Colgate,
when it has a particular problem, works
out a plan of research attack and ques-
tionnaires and sends them to its US
head office. Here they are knocked into
shape and additional useful hints given.
It is not yet economically feasible in
Australia to do much of the work that
is being done in America. Organisations
like du Pont are spending hundreds of
thousands of dollars a year on advertis-
ing research alone. Most of the prob-
lems in advertising research are psycho-
logical problems.”
Market research tends to follow slight-
ly different patterns in Sydney and Mel-
bourne. Melbourne firms seem to do
more industry research, getting the gen-
eral pattern throughout a whole sector
of business life, while in Sydney work
tends to be concentrated more on pro-
duct research, the “soaps and soups”,
more basic but, perhaps, more difficult,
with smaller margins for error.
Although the reputable agencies gen-
erally have no difficulty in surviving (one
br two have been in market research
for 30 years or more), more and more
large firms tend to establish their own
market research units within the com-
pany. Many of the oil, motor and, of
course, the “soaps and soups” have their
own high-level research units.
The tendency of the small, independ-
ent market research firm is to specialise,
in, say, audience reaction to television,
or almost any branch of consumer de-


mand. The firm will then do a study
which, to make the research profitable,
it will then try to sell to as many
clients or prospective clients as possible.
But a general study is often too hap-
hazard for the board-room of the
sophisticated company. It may answer
some questions, but not all, and the big
board-room wants all the answers. The
bigger the company the more drastic the
results of a mistake.
The large corporations can establish
their own research unit, but this is, of
course, not possible for the smaller
firm, many of which with only a tiny
share of the available market have
much more tricky problems in maiket-
ing. These smaller firms may turn to
the unskilled market research agency
with disastrous results.
Australia faces another situation not
common to marketing research alone.
Because of the relatively small size of
the industry, it is proving difficult to
attract people with sufficient calibre and
to offer them an adequate salary. There
is not enough recognition of the need for
considerable technical competence
mathematical, scientific, economic,
psychological. There is little recognition
of deliberate recruiting policy Many
people with no particular talents have
been able to enter the field too easily.
Again, as for many commercial opera-
tions in Australia, there seems insuffici-
ent encouragement of intellectual inno-
vation and effort, a serious under-esti-
mation of how much needs to be known.
Largely for these reasons, market re-
searchers in Australia are seeking closer
connections with the academics. The
recently founded professorship of mar-
keting at the University of New South
Wales provides one evidence of the de-
mand: it was inaugurated and financed
mainly by business interests.
The main contact the man-in-the-
street has with market research is the
woman-at-the-front-door. Interviewers
“As a matter of fact, I wouldn't
be without one."
are generally recruited on a casual basis
among women in the 25-45 age group.
The qualifications may be only the
ability to drive a car and read a road-
map.
For some agencies even these require-
ments are not necessary. Some agencies
keep their interviewers at desks and
bring suitable or unsuitable sub-
jects in from the highways and byways.
One interviewer said she sat at a desk,
shuffling through a series of question-
naires. An officer of the company went
into the suburban street outside and
brought in any likely or willing
subject for interview. The interviewer
then filled cut as many questionnaires
as the subject had patience for. The
interviewer used discretion only with the
subject of questionnaires; it was no use
asking older women about baby foods,
for example.
The ideal interviewer, of course, has
no views or prejudices at all. In any
case she is not told the purpose of the
survey, what result is hoped for, or
what happens to her questionnaires after
she hands them in at the end of the
day.
If the ordinary citizen touches the
survey process at the point of a door-
knock and an often ill-composed ques-
tionnaire, businessmen quickly learn
that more advanced and detailed meth-
ods can be _alled into use. Though
rarely used in Australia, because of the
initial expense of programming, even the
übiquitous computer is finding a bigger
place in survey work overseas.
If Australian business and consumer
trade generally were more awake and
technically aware, it would hardlv be
necessary to point out that the resources
of modern sampling techniques, of
operational research, of depth osvchol-
ogy are available for the evaluation of
markets, internal and export. Yet busi-
nessmen and media users e'ervwhere
are hazy about the real effects of their
advertising campaigns; marketing re-
search is ready to tackle more exact
" I've just been using that soap that
gives you a youthful complexion all
over. What's its name?"
evaluation and would improve its stand-
ards of judgment if greater support were
given to methodological research. A cur-
sory acquaintance with the literature, in-
cluding the journal of the Marketing
Research Society of Australia, does not
suggest that market researchers are mak-
ing too big a claim for their discipline
The sociological implications of mar-
ket research cannot be lightly denied.
Yet we are living! in an increasingly
self-conscious and image-prone indus-
trial society.
Expert market researchers themselves
are still looking for some sort of pre-
dictive power. “We can tell our clients
what somebody did yesterday or in the
last seven days; we can tell people the
pattern of behavior, but we are still not
able to say why people behave in a cer-
tain way at least, not with sufficient
accuracy,” says Dr Henry Nowick, the
well-known research director of the Eng-
lish firm of Pet Foods Ltd.
“Incidentally, I believe that at least
•50 per cent of market research surveys
are a complete and utter waste of time
and money,” Dr Nowick adds.
Remote Control Government
A place for market research techniques
By J. C. HORSFALL
the pains commercial enterprises take to keep abreast of consumer
tastes and preferences, it is surprising Australian governments have not made
more use of market research techniques in their quest for business intelligence. The
isolation of Canberra from the State capitals, where most of the natron’s business is
done, only emphasises the need for employing the most modern methods to ga;h»:r
such information.
One sometimes gets the impression
that the civil service mentality is a block
to this. Whether that is so or not, in sev-
eral Federal departments there seems to
be a grave reluctance to mix it with
the madding crowd as much as is de-
sirable, while, going on its relations to
the Vernon Report, the Government it-
self seems content to stay mainly in
the throne room

be it by Government departments or
special committees such as that headed
by Sir James Vernon, but of informa-
tion to be gathered day by day in the
conduct of business information which
it is essential for the Government to
know in order to be fully effective in
its relations with the business world.
The charge is not that Government
and administrators operate in a vacuum.
Far from it. As commercial and indus-
trial life has thickened and become more
sophisticated in Australia, so has Gov-
ernment influence on it become more
pervasive and penetrating. A duality of
interests has evolved which has dictated
that Government get fully informed
about the facts, opinions and expecta-
tions of business. Nor has the duty been
shirked. One has only to instance, say,
the Department of Labor and National
Service as being excellently informed.
Its strings are out over the whole field
of private employment and it knows
practically to a man where people are em-
ployed and where jobs are available.
The infinite pains taken by the Min-
istry of Labor to be fully informed in
its particular field may, of course, de-
rive from maintenance of full employ-
ment being a critical factor in the poli-
tical equation. Anyhow, no other de-
partment of Federal Government is so
assiduous. At the other extreme, cynics
might attribute the Treasury’s lack of
touch with the business world to its
commanding position as holder of the
purse strings. One does get the impres-
sion that the Treasury’s decisions are
mostly taken in camera in Canberra,
with a newspaper or two and a few tele-
phone the only purveyors of
business climate and opinion.
As a matter of fact, one has reason
to believe that the Treasury itself feels
rather guilty about its shortcomings in
this particular respect. There was an idea-
some time ago to do more about it than
simply extending the Treasurer’s calls
among his social friends, who would by
coincidence perhaps also be Melbourne
businessmen. However, one has yet to
hear of Mr Holt taking up the idea put
to him by Mr Carroll at the Economic
Forum in Melbourne that business ex-
perts should find permanent seats in
Treasury parlors or at least roam its
corridors.
The monasticism of Sir Roland Wilson
might be a bar to this. One cannot see
him being all that comfortable sur-
rounded by business efficiency experts,
at least not at this late stage in his oc-
cupancy of the Secretaryship. In his
younger days at the Bureau of Census
and Statistics, of course, Sir Roland set
the pace in developing the now over-
whelming statistical network which has
become a nightmare to businessmen
obliged to fill up all the Bureau’s forms.
Let it be said at once that the techniques
of market research have long been em-
ployed at the Bureau. Few commercial
firms can now hold a candle to it in the
matter of computerised collation of eco-
nomic and much other information in-
valuable to the business world.
True enough, when it comes to the
really big questions such as whether the
exchange rate should be changed, import
restrictions imposed or even whether
this tax or that should be increased,
another dropped and so on, the Govern-
ment departments cannot get much out-
side assistance by any routine method.
Except where there are good sounding
boards like for the tariff, all they can
do is to study the facts and possibilities,
and keep an ear to the ground to learn
what outside people and the Press are
saying. With our alert financial Press
and plenty of businessmen like Mr Stani-
"I only buy products advertised on
good, clean, wholesome shows."

forth Ricketson and (more rarely) Sir
lan Potter, and the various trade unions
and business organisations prepared to
air their views in public on these major
questions, this is not a bad way to get
the answers. We all know that most of
these people will be talking their own
book; it is only a matter of the Govern-
ment doing the necessary discounting.
Perhaps it wouldn’t be a very good
idea for the Government to send round
its scouts into business, in a similar fash-
ion to market researchers, to get con-
fidential opinions on these major ques-
tions. On the other hand there would
seem to be a role, for such types to do
more information seeking for Govern-
ment departments on minor matters. To
take an example, the Treasury could im-
prove its commercial intelligence ser-
vices by employing itinerant officers in
the major capital cities to garner infor-
mation or. day-to-day trends in the
money markets, all of which would be
invaluable in making decisions on some
of the big questions facing the Treasury
from time to time, as well as the run-
ning one of monetary control.
Trends in Market Research
Britain ahead of America
By K. M. VAGG
TI/TARKET research and marketing have simultaneously developed as twentieth century
fields of enquiry, and for this reason the two are sometimes confused. Marketing
is a co-ordinating activity; research is (he group of techniques or disciplines (from both
the behavioral and mathematical sciences) used to gather information for marketing
Market research is to civilians what
intelligence is to the military. It is con-
cerned with all aspects of marketing, with
problems relating to products, markets,
and-methods of sales and distribution.
When discussing market research
trends one could concentrate on the be-
wildering . developments in techniques
that are occurring all over the world,
though this misses the point. The only
general comment I would venture is that
an adequate sociological theory of the
consumer may serve as a unifying con-
cept within the social sciences.
Techniques are important, but the
most noteworthy trends are the different
ways in which market research is being
used. In use (as distinct from techniques)
I believe the British may be five to ten
years ahead of the rest of the English-
speaking world
This opinion is partly based on the
quality of the British market research
literature, but the most telling example
of their superiority occurs in the field of
audience research—a notoriously ex-
pensive area. There is an industry con-
tract for TV audience research and an-
other for Press audience research; in this
way about £750,000 per year is spent on
figures for 84 newspapers and magazines
and for viewing in all 13 TV areas. The
cost of this information is levied on all
the interested parties, which then com-
pete in their managerial skill and ability
to use the information.
Figures have been produced twice a
year since 1948, so there is now enough
information to plot long-term trends.
(Paradoxically, this is the reason for re-
taining the British system of audience
measurement in its present form. The
trends are so valuable that they have
been retained for as long as possible,
even though systematic biases have been
charted in some of the questioning tech-
niques.)
American audience research, on the
other hand, is much more fragmented.
There are at present four firms offering
restricted media-marketing surveys, and
more are preparing to enter, for prestige
reasons, although the market is not large
enough to support those .research firms
which are already in this field.
America differs from both Australia
and Britain in having a tradition of large
and highly respected research firms who
engage in “custom” research for in-
dividual clients. Because American in-
dustry, is less centralised than our own,
they seem to have less information about
overall industry trends.
The largest body of the best American
work is internal studies carried out by
such industrial giants as du Pont,
Proctor and Gamble, Ford, and General
Foods. Such organisations have the
money and staff to engage in continuous
market research programmes and system-
atically extend their knowledge.
Major overseas firms are now attempt-
ing to apply the same standards of
accountability to advertising as to other
items of business expenditure. For many
years they have received reasonably
accurate circulation data; they now
expect equally accurate information
about the total audience for particular
newspapers, magazines, TV and radio
stations. They are also seeking measure-
ment of the audience for a particular
advertisement, and, beyond this, for
measurement of the sales resulting from
that advertisement.
This leads, on the one hand, to pressure
on the media for more research into the
market for particular products repre-
sented by a given audience and, on the
other, to pressure on the advertising

agencies for media scheduling and media
selection models. The result is a con-
siderable increase in the use of com-
puters, which are accepted by British
and American market research as part of
the work-a-day scene.
Computers require formalised market-
ing and media models. The available
research information can only be digested
if expressed in common categories (e.g.,
you can’t compare reading habits of
persons aged 16 years and over with pur-
chasing habits of persons aged 12 years
and over). This has tended to make
market researchers standardise their
terms and concepts. It is also causing
a merger in the formerly separate fields
of market and media research.
Australian market research naturally
seems less highly developed than over-
seas. After all, it is essentially a post-
war phenomenon in this country. In
Europe and the USA it developed be-
tween the two wars. Moreover, good
research tends to be expensive and the
limitations on the size of the Australian
market restrict the amount we can spend
on research. Again, the local universities
(whatever the reasons) have not been an
intellectual force in many fields of busi-
ness inquiry.
There are about a dozen well-estab-
lished commercial market research firms,
mainly in Sydney and Melbourne, and
they operate under all the limitations of
a small market. Most are dependent on
their clients for their existence and so
labor under a major disadvantage in
bargaining. They operate in a buyer’s
market with three important con-
sequences:
(1) Because they are selling at a low
price, the market research firms are
forced to produce a volume of work that
is large in relation to their available
resources of skill. This can result in
hastily designed and ill-conceived surveys.
(2) The need to seek volume rather
than quality results in a large proportion
of market research companies’ work
being performed for clients who are in
the middle to small range of business
firms. Such firms do not usually have
trained market researchers on their staff
and are therefore unable to tell good
statistics from cheap and shoddy ones.
(3) The market research companies
are forced by their individual clients to
ask impossible questions and to use
definitions which vary from survey to
survey. Therefore these individual sur-
veys do not come together to give an
overall picture of the Australian
economy.
The main Australian trends seem to be
more sophistication in the use of re-
search. It is starting to be used as a
management tool rather than a pro-
motional aid. There is also an increas-
ingly healthy scepticism about unsub-
stantiated market research claims. Valida-
tion studies have been part of overseas
business life for years and it can safely
be predicted that they will be increasingly
demanded in Australia.

THE MAN ON THE LAND AGRISEARCH
Treatment of Sheath Rot
TV/Ir W. Southcott, a CSIRO veterin-
arian, has now demonstrated that
flocks may be maintained free of the
nasty sheath rot disease for long periods
by antiseptic treatment and diet control.
This practical programme stems from his
discovery that sheath rot is initiated by
a bacterium, but only when the sheep’s
urine has a high urea content. Good
quality pasture, i.e., one providing a high
protein diet, produces a high level of urea
in the urine. Contrariwise, rough grazing
or fasting lowers urea excretion.
Sheath rot, now preferably known
as posthitis, has been a significant cost on
the sheep industry in the better-watered
fringe of eastern Australia since the turn
of the century at least. The disease has
been increasing with the spread of im-
proved pastures; until now there has been
no practical means of checking it. Though
the death rate has never been alarmingly
high, the disease makes animals very un-
thrifty and hence causes considerable
loss of wool and meat production. It
is also responsible for breaks in the wool
and probably provokes flystrike. Since the
true nature of the affliction has never
been adequately understood, until Mr
Southcott’s elucidation of it, much money
has undoubtedly been spent on futile
efforts to control or cure.
His key finding is that a bacterium
is involved and that the disease is, accor-
dingly, contagious. Coupled with this is
another finding, namely, that the bacter-
ium feeds on urea and liberates ammonia
as a by-product. Presumably, the am-
monia. if produced in sufficient quantity,
damages the skin and the primary ulcer
then begins to develop with other bacteria
establishing themselves and aggravating
the situation. Mr Southcott made a third
pertinent discovery: the particular bacter-
ium concerned in the formation of ulcers
leading to sheath rot in wethers and
rams is also responsible for the “scabby
ulcer" vulvitis of ewes and for the lesions
sometimes on the prepuce of steers. The
bacterium can be isolated from any one
of these sources, cultured under labora-
tory conditions, and used to infect clean
sheep providing they are on a good
quality diet.
For the flo:k-owner the basic prin-
ciple of control is to stop the natural
transmission of the bacterium from sheep
to sheep and even from cattle to sheep.
This calls for the rigid segregation of
affected animals until they are cured by
the application of antiseptic dressings,
together w'ith the adjustment of the diet
towards a lower protein intake. If war-
ranted, precautions can also be taken
to prevent the appearance of the dis-
ease in a flock or, at least, to reduce the
incidence of it. Thus, the sheep could
be given regular antiseptic treatments as
a routine. The frequency of these will de-
pend on the district, the type of stock,
and the quality of the pasture.
On Chiswick, the CSIRO field sta-
tion near Armidale, Mr Southcott man-
aged to keep fairly large flocks of mixed
weaners disease-free for a year with three
treatments. Another flock in which the
disease was already well established was
nearly cleaned up as a result of five anti-
septic treatments and a period spent after
the first treatment on a relatively poor
quality grass pasture.
Several experiments on the natural
spread of the bacterium showed that
venereal contact was an important means
of transmission When rams with pos-
thitis were joined with virgin ewes a
high incidence of vulvitis ensued. More-
over, the lesions developed about the
time of lambing and ulcers were seen
on quite young lambs. This pathway,
therefore, seems to be an important
means of passing the contagion from one
generation to the next. Clearly, rams
should be closely inspected before join-
ing and as an additional precaution, even
if no signs of ulcers are apparent, their
prepuces should be wiped with antisep-
tic. Of course, to make this programme
thoroughly effective the ewes also should
be sybjected to a similar treatment.
Finally, in some circumstances the re-
sults may repay the effort of giving the
lambs one or two treatments before
weaning.
The antiseptics used in these investi-
gations were “Cetafoot” and “Hibitane”.
For preventive purposes both seemed to
be equally good, but “Cetafoot" cured
existing ulcers better. However, it is
rather severe on sensitive tissue and
should be used with caution. Other anti-
septics may be quite as effective as either
©f these two.
Farm Incomes
\ s measured by the returns lodged with
the Taxation Department, average
farm incomes kept pace with the non-
farm incomes of self-employed people
during the decade 1952-53 to 1961-62.
The authors of this information, E. S.
Hoffman and J. R. Hume, of the Bureau
of Agricultural Economics, point out
that the comparison is between actual
incomes rather than taxable incomes. On
this basis the comparison wou’d favor
primary producers slightlv because they
are allowed a higher depreciation rate

on plant, equipment, and structural im-
provements. Also differences in oppor-
tunities for tax avoidance could ob-
scure the real relationship between the
three groups considered primary pro-
ducers, other self-employed persons, and
male wage and salary earners. The lat-
ter group, who never get to handle part
of their wages or salary, scarcely have
a chance to cheat. The extent of cheat-
ing in the other two groups is not known,
but it certainly occurs widely as the list
of cases of detected understatement pub-
lished annually by the Department
attests.
Selection of the income year 1952-53
as the first year of the period was chosen
partly because no major changes in tax
regulations have been made since then
and partly because it largely avoids the
boom rural income resulting from the
Korean war. Nevertheless, while the
median income of all three groups was
strikingly similar, the incomes of farm-
ers reflected much greater instability than
the incomes of the other groups.
median income, which is the mid-
A die income in the range extending
from highest to lowest, was £1079 for
farmers in 1961-62. For the self-em-
ployed non-farmer group it was £llO6,
and for the wage and salary earners it
was £1123. However, the average income
figure for the groups was £1393, £1514,
and £ 1 162 respectively.
This comparability between the three
groups in Australia contrasts markedly
with the general situation in the Western
countries overseas. In the USA, for in-
stance, rural incomes have lagged so
badly in recent years that the disparity
between town and country standards of
living has created a sore national con-
science. Why the same has not happened
here is an unanswered question. Some
say there are signs that it may be be-
ginning to happen. For example, the in-
come trend over the decade was for
fewer Australian farmers to have in-
comes greater than the average of farm-
ers, whereas the reverse applied for wage
and salary earners. Moreover, although
the money incomes of non-farm people
kept ahead of the general price level
during this period, farmers’ money in-
comes have not. In other words, their
real incomes have declined. They were
relatively better off in the early 1950 s
than in the early 19605.
Other facts borne out by the study
were that farmers in Victoria and Tas-
mania do not, on the average, have in-
comes as large as those in other States
and that sheep grazing is more profitable
than sheep-wheat raising, which in turn
is more profitable than other forms of
primary production. The scale of the
farmer’s enterprise has a greater influ-
ence on his income than the nature of his
enterprise.

Yarra Falls Further
A fiery meeting ahead?
VTarra Falls, Victorian-based textile
A manufacturer, has rounded off an
era of decline with a huge but not un-
expected loss. Last year's deal with Felt
and Textiles appears to have done the
group more harm than good. Although
dividend has been omitted again, direct-
ors were quick to point out in last week's
report that the £500,000 issue of unse-
cured notes, maturing on September 30,
would be redeemed in full.
This indicates that the company is still
a long way from the grave. However, the
repayment will leave directors so much
less with which to extricate the company
from its troubles. These would appear to
be a little deeper than suggested by the
£200,000 loss.
Although nothing much can be gleaned
before the balance sheet is released, one
fact stands out. As the loss was not after
any tax provision, it cannot be strictly
compared with the £20,000 profit earned
in 1963-64. This profit was after tax of
£97,000. So, in effect, the loss must be
compared with the 1963-64 pre-tax profit
of £117,000.
Directors said that the parent company
made a £48,000 loss in comparison to
the previous t 50,000 profit. They pointed
out these two figures were not comparable
because of changes made in the group's
structure during the year. They did not
indicate whether the structural changes
adversely or beneficially affected the re-
sult. If the effect was beneficial then
the parent’s loss must be seriously re-
garded. If it was not, the opposite applies.
The annual meeting on November 12
could be a fiery one. This will depend on
shareholders and their desire to know
exactly what the situation is and what
the future holds.
Honest Builder
rpnE directors of Consolidated Home
Industries are at least frank in their
opinions on the 1965-66 prospects of the
building industry. In fact they were so
frank in the annual report that many
shareholders must be rather concerned
over the current year. Shareholders, per-
haps, have become a little too accus-
tomed to the ifs, buts and conditional
forecasts in which the directors of most
building companies choose to cushion
their more uninspiring statements.
CHI directors said in their report that
the value of domestic contracts currently
held was “somewhat below” the level at
the same time in 1964. This is a reflec-
tion of the restrictions placed on first-
mortgage home finance. Fortunately,
other contracts on hand lift the com-
bined level of orders above that of 1964.
However, directors emphasised that, if
the present restrictions continued, profits
in the second half of the year would
be affected. This is tantamount to saying
that, on present indications, profit will
be lower in the current year.
Nevertheless, shareholders can take
some heart from the fact that profits
in the latest year were understated in re-
lation to 1963-64. Directors pointed out
that the method of calculating the profit
on land sold on terms was changed dur-
ing the year. The effect of this was to
reduce profit by some £lB,OOO. This
amount was carried into the balance sheet
as deferred income. Although it reveals
profits on a lower basis than in previous
years, the new method of calculation un-
doubtedly puts the accounts on a more
accurate footing, especially as far as
the possibility of bad debts is con-
cerned.
Watts Better
p. A. Watts, the Melbourne-based
building contractor which was listed
for the first time last year, has managed
to lift earning rate to a level which is
more in line with that expected of most
building companies for 1964-65. The
figure came out at 23.3 p.c., after a jump
in profit from £91,000 to £151,000. As
the 1963-64 earning rate was only 14
p.c., there was some concern at flotation
that profits were not high enough to
withstand the adverse fluctuations of the
industry and still pay reasonable divi-
dends.
These concerns can now be set aside.
Dividend for the nine months over which
the shares rank is 8 p.c. Directors expect
a full 10 p.c. payout in the current year.
The buoyant earning rate and the
higher profits expected this year will
ensure such a payout without any
trouble. Sales rose from £12.495,000 to
£13,506,000 in 1964-65. Forward con-
tracts now on the books indicate that
turnover in 1965-66 will be just as high.

ANNUAL MEETING
AUSTRALIAN UNITED CORPORATION LTD.
The Chairman of Australian United Corporation Ltd., Sir lan Potter, addressed
shareholders at the annual meeting of the company, held in Melbourne on Friday,
September 70.
Sir lan said:
Before dealing with the formal matters
relating to the Annual Accounts I should
like to refer to changes in the Board of
Directors which have occurred since I last
addressed you.
The death of Mr Sidney Powell, CMG,
came as a great shock to all of us and we
sadly miss the wise and friendly counsel
he brought to our affairs.
The retirement of Mr D. B. Lewington
lost us another friend of wide experience
and we wish to thank him sincerely for his
service to the Company.
Shareholders will, I am sure, join me in
welcoming Mr A. N. Armstrong, -CBE, to
the Board of Directors. His wisdom and
experience have already contributed greatly
to our deliberations.
It is with pleasure now that I submit to
you a motion for the adoption of the eighth
annual Balance Sheet and supporting Ac-
counts of Australian United Corporation
Limited, together with the Reports of the
Directors and Auditors.
The Consolidated Net Profit for the year
ended 30th June, 1965, is £570,068 com-
pared with £551,296 for the previous year.
Of this profit £531,059 remains to Aus-
tralian United Corporation Limited after
allowance for the interests of minority
shareholders in the profits of subsidiary
companies. The comparable amount last
year was £506,734.
The Consolidated Net Profit has been
struck after providing for taxation on a
basis which reflects allowance for accumu-
lated losses arising from the liquidation of
the trading assets of our wholly owned sub-
sidiary Australian United Finance Limited
(formerly Sargood Gardner Limited).
An interim dividend of 5% on the Ordin-
ary and Preference capital was paid on
19th March, 1965, and the fixed dividend
of 5% on the Preference capital was paid
on 22nd June, 1965. A final dividend of
5% on the Ordinary and Preference capital
has been declared payable on 1-Oth Septem-
ber, 1965. This total dividend requirement
absorbed £172,676 of the year’s profit,
leaving an amount of £358,383 to be ad-
ded to the unappropriated profits of the
Group from the year’s operations.
After transferring £12,447 to General
Reserve and £393,680 to Reserve for Con-
tingencies the balance of unappropriated
profits at 30th June, 1965, stood at
£1,274,215.
I shall now refer to the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.
There was no change in the paid up capi-
tal of Australian United Corporation dur-
ing the year. I have already referred to the
increase in unappropriated profits arising
from the year’s operations and to the trans-
fers made from unappropriated profits to
General Reserve and Reserve for Contin-
gencies. The net result of these movements
is an increase in Shareholders’ Funds from
£5,386,971 to £5,765,685.
Current Liabilities have risen by £921,898
which reflects an increase in Deposits of
approximately £1,000,000 offset by minor
movements in other current liabilities. Long
Term Liabilities have increased by £IO,OOO.
Investment in quoted securities increased
by £1,407,098 and in unquoted securities
fell by £138,887. The market value of
quoted securities at 30th June, 1965, was
marginally below the value at which those
securities are carried in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet, a reflection of the depres-
sed state of stock exchange prices ruling
at the end of the financial year.
Advances fell by £584,110. Current as-
sets rose by £850,460 as the result, in the
main, of an increase of approximately
£1,200,000 in securities carried by our of-
ficial money market subsidiary, a reduc-
tion of £477,250 in amounts owing by
associated companies and lesser movements
in other current assets.
The reduction of £286,837 in Freehold
Properties arises from the progressive dis-
posal of land and buildings owned by Aus-
tralian United Finance Limited (formerly
Sargood Gardner Limited). Minor move-
ments only have occurred in the other fixed
assets of the Group and these do not call
for particular comment.
I shall now review briefly the operations
of our main subsidiary and associated
companies.
AUSTRALIAN UNITED
ENTERPRISES PTY LIMITED
The portfolio of quoted investments car-
ried by this subsidiary increased during the
year from £4,402,491 to £4,765,428 and
the portfolio of investments which are not
quoted was reduced from £856,189 to
£365,124. The market value of quoted in-
vestments as at 30th June, 1965, was
£4,819,779.
Dividend income exceeded that of last
year and adjustments to the portfolio dur-
ing the year again realised a surplus, though
on a lower scale than last year.
AUSTRALIAN UNITED
UNDERWRITING COMPANY
PTY LIMITED
This subsidiary was actively engaged
throughout the year as a sub-underwriter
principally of industrial and commercial
capital issues. Its levels of earnings and
profits were much in line with those of last
year.
AUSTRALIAN UNITED
FINANCE LIMITED
In my last address I informed sharehold-
ers that as the trading assets of Sargood
Gardner Limited had virtually been
liquidated it was intended to change the
name of the company to Australian United
Finance Limited. This was effected during
December, 1964, and from that date Aus-
tralian United Finance became an active
member of the AUC Group, principally as
a sub-underwriter of capital issues. In this
new role the company was busy during the
second half of the year and its activities
contributed substantially to the Group
profits.
UNITED DISCOUNT
COMPANY OF AUSTRALIA
LIMITED
It was a difficult year for dealers in the
official money market and though the opera-
tions of this subsidiary were again profitable
the results were below those of last year.
Tightening liquidity as the year progres-
sed caused upward pressure on the rates of
interest sought by lenders to the market


and this had a significant effect on operat-
ing margins.
Some degree of flexibility in the type of
security which dealers are permitted to hold
was provided during the year through the
introduction to the market of a limited vol-
ume of commercial bills accepted or en-
dorsed by the trading banks, and this was
a welcome step in the right direction.
AUSTRALIAN UNITED
ACCEPTANCE LIMITED
This subsidiary operated at about the
same level as last year though its profit
was somewhat higher. Its business is to pro-
vide facilities for short term industrial and
commercial borrowers and its resources
were fully employed throughout the year.
AUSTRALIAN UNITED
DEVELOPMENT PTY
LIMITED
The principal investments of this com-
pany are now held in several new industrial
ventures which have recently been estab-
lished or are in the process of being estab-
lished in association with important over-
seas concerns. It will be some time before
these new ventures contribute to the profits
of the company but, meanwhile, certain in-
vestments made in past years have come
to fruition and these enable the company
not only to absorb the cost of carrying new
investments but also to contribute satisfac-
torily to the Group profits.
INVESTORS SERVICES
LIMITED
The Group is associated in Investors
Services Limited with The Commercial
Bank of Australia Limited and Messrs lan
Potter & Co. The company manages Aus-
tralian Capital Fund, Australian Income
Fund and Collins Street Fund, all of which
showed satisfactory results for the year.
During the year Second Australian Capital-
Fund was successfully merged with Aus-
tralian Capital Fund.
GLANVILL ENTHOVEN &
CO. (Aust.) PTY LIMITED
We have a half interest in- this insurance
broking company with Glanvill Enthoven &
Co. Limited of London. During the year
the company continued to widen the area
of its activities and it is pleasing to inform
shareholders that in the second full year
of its operation in Australia the company
has traded profitably.
GENERAL
1965 presented its problems to the AUC
Group and in some directions activities
were less profitable than last year. However
the diversity of our interests has enabled
us once again to earn profits of an order
that has made possible a significant addition
to Group Reserves after payment of divi-
dends.
The outlook for the current year is a
somewhat mixed one and it would be un-
wise of me to-day to attempt to forecast
too precisely how it is likely to unfold for
us. I do however see another active year
ahead of the AUC Group and though, as
I have said to shareholders on previous oc-
casions, it is in the nature of our business
for earnings to fluctuate with economic
conditions from year to year, I expect when
next I address you to be able to report satis-
factory results.
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
A year ago I expressed the view that the
basic problem of the Australian economy
was one of the rate of growth. I said then
that an increase of 9% in the Gross
National Product would be hard to main-
tain in a period of full employment. In
fact, this rate of increase in the Gross
National Product was maintained during
1964-65 so that for a further twelve months
the resources of the Australian economy
have been taxed to the utmost. This is re-
flected in the present state of full employ-
ment and the plentiful signs that the re-
sources of the economy are fully extended.
The main difference however between the
conditions ruling to ; day and those of last
year are that we have since run into a
period of acute difficulties in our balance
of payments, from which we are not likely
to make a quick recovery. During 1964-
65 Australia showed a deficit on current
account of £375m. and after allowing for
capital inflow, our national reserves were
diminished by £lsßm. This creates a prob-
lem in itself but its effect is multiplied
through the consequential diminution in the
domestic liquidity of the economy.
This reduction in liquidity has been a re-
versal of the trends of the last two or three
years, during which time official policy was
directed towards minimising the effects of
high liquidity upon the internal financial
structure. To some extent this policy has
now been reversed and some of the liquidity
that was drained off in the years of sur-
plus can now be re-injected to sustain the
level of activity in the economy.
However, the problem is not quite so
simple in that the broad financial picture
tends to conceal some of the basic trends
which have been developing over the last
year or so. As the Reserve Bank has re-
cently pointed out the activity in the pri-
vate sector of the economy in 1964-65 far
exceeded that of the public sector to the
extent that the liabilities of the private
sector increased by well over £2oom. more
than the growth in its financial assets. This
movement, while significant, is not alarm-
ing when measured in terms of a Gross
National Product of £9,500m. When,
however, it is realised that the greater part
of the reduction in net financial assets of
the private sector has come from overseas
funds, then it is necessary to take some
stock of the situation. With first and second
line overseas reserves of well over £ I,ooom.
this rate of drift could continue for some
time, but obviously the difficulties of ar-
resting it quickly to avoid drastic action
imply the need for a much shorter-range
policy. In fact the rate of depletion of
overseas reserves is likely to accelerate
during 1965-66. The problem therefore of
restoring lost liquidity without exaggerating
the inherently inflationary tendencies in a
period of full employment will require
most careful planning by the authorities.
Super-imposed on the problems of finance
of the private sector are the exigencies of
public finance which fortunately do not
seem likely to represent the same relative
drain on resources as in the last year or
so. Nevertheless, in a stringent financial
situation, the terms of public loan raisings
may be affected, with consequent reaction
upon the whole structure of interest rates.
There is no reason why Australia should
not successfully negotiate the difficulties of
the next twelve months. The most import-
ant element in financial management is an
awareness of the trends and an apprecia-
tion of the need to take early steps to
counteract or to moderate their influence.
The authorities have demonstrated their
capacity to handle such problems by ad-
ministrative action, although at some stage
a persistent deterioration in the balance of
payments may be remedied only on the
political level.
It is not inconceivable that within the
next twelve months direct steps may have
to be taken to check the current rate of
imports which despite official expectations
to the contrary, continues to accelerate.
Correction through the credit structure of
the external imbalance that present trends
suggest, may prove more onerous and in-
exact than the economy can handle without
major dislocation. For five years Australia
has performed splendidly as a free economy
in a world of restrictions on trade and
capital movements. We should not be too
concerned if we are forced by circum-
stances to apply ourselves to a similar
policy.
It may well be, of course, that the situa-
tion may prove to be merely transitory.
Capital inflow at the moment under a
cloud, may prove to be more substantial
than originally expected. The flow of im-
ports may level off or even fall. Sound
financial management with a modicum of
good luck could see Australia through the
next twelve months without too much dis-
turbance. But it would be wrong and prob-
ably unnecessary to back our luck too much.
Time is on our side. Within a year or
so Australia will start to benefit from a
growing volume of exports in iron ore,
bauxite and other minerals which ul-
timately will add enormously to our ex-
ternal stability and strength. In the mean-
time, the Australian financial system will
face a perplexing and, at times, a difficult
situation, which your Directors believe it
is equipped to handle effectively.
STAFF
Your Directors again wish to place on
record their appreciation of the work done
by the staff and I am sure shareholders
will join me in thanking the staff for their
continued loyalty and efficiency throughout
the year.

Higher metal prices were the chief
contributors to the profit improvement.
EZI Does It
JTIasmanian zinc miner and smelter EZ
Industries Ltd created a new profit
record in the last June year.
Higher prices for zinc, lead and cop-
per catapulted profit from £2.9m. to
£3.9m., after tax of £2.8m. and de-
preciation of £1.0m.
The company’s high degree of liquidity
enables it to pay out a large proportion
of profits in dividends to shareholders.
In 1963-64 it earned 16.1 p.c. and divi-
dend rate was 13 p.c. This latest year
it has earned 21.8 p.c. on capital and is
distributing 18 p.c., with a final payment
of 14 p.c.
It was possible to buy the 10s. shares
recently at 22s., where the yield was a
remarkable 8.2 p.c.
Golden Promise
olden Poultry’s effort in the latest
™ year can only be described as en-
viable. Despite a one-for-five par issue
and a share placement, which lifted capi-
tal from £270,000 to £394,000 during
the year, earning rate eased only mar-
ginally from 35.3 to 34.1 p.c. In ad-
dition, the record profit, up from
£100,000 to £139,000, was achieved in
the face of depreciation up from
£37,000 to £50,000 and, of course, tax
up from £40,000 to £52,000.
In some quarters the result was a sur-
prising one. Even shareholders did not
expect an almost 40 p.c. profit rise for
the year. In the interim report, directors
told them that sales had risen by 49 p.c.
in the first half, but emphasised that the
rise in profit had not been proportionate.
The current year has long been on the
cards as a bright one for the group, yet
the fact that 1964-65 left no lost ground
to recover leaves shareholders in an even
better position. The establishment costs
of a new subsidiary called General Pro-
vedors (Aust.) Pty Ltd were the main
cause of the smaller gain in profits dur-
ing 1964-65. In the current year no
such costs will be borne and the sub-
sidiary should contribute to results for
the first time. Thus its benefits will be
twofold — lowering costs and increas-
ing profits.
With the 10 p.c. dividend covered
more than three times by the earnings,
shareholders will be well within reason
to anticipate another share issue or a
lift in dividend.

Out of the Depths?
HPwo years ago, followers of Deposit and Investment Ltd read
A the first chapter in the serialised story of bad debts from
loans on small businesses.
Supermarkets and regional shopping centres are blamed for
the difficulties in which small food retailers, particularly, find
themselves. Directors make the point that they themselves hold
over three million of the 16 million issued shares and are per-
sonally concerned at the persistence of these losses.
After writing off £1,670,753 in bad debts, Deposit and In-
vestment arrived at a net loss for 1965 of £656,167. In the
preceding year £2,539,862 was written off as bad debts; of
this sum £935,893 was charged to general reserve and not to
1964 trading surplus, so that the net loss per the accounts was
£537,532.
Profit and loss appropriation is also debited with a further
£790,000 in respect of doubtful debts as at June, 1965. The
total debit is now £2,081,000, reducing tangible asset backing
to 4s. 2d. a share.
In the preliminary report, directors comforted shareholders
with the news that there is no liquidity problem and that the
cash inflow for the year is £ 11.1m.
A Federal Mess
Hotels continues to wallow in a bog of over-
■*- capitalisation and over-borrowing. Turnover rose 14 p.c.
in the latest year, but the higher £155,000 profit is still only
equal to a meagre 4 p.c. on ordinary capital. Dividend will
t*e omitted for the second year in succession as funds are
needed for the modernisation and enlargement of various
hotel facilities throughout the nation. Even forgetting these
necessities, the group cannot really afford to pay a dividend
anyway.
Cash is also needed to pay off unsecured notes in the cur-
rent year. The borrowing and interest problems are well
illustrated by the fact that during 1964-65 £155,000 — as much
as the profit — was spent on the refunding of notes, the re-
payment of mortgages and further investment in a sinking
fund for the redemption of debenture stock.
The profit was after tax at £114,000, compared with
£99,000 previously, and also after depreciation of £122,000,
up from £112.000 previously.
If the trend of profits in the second half of the year can
be taken as any indication, the current year looks like another
rather gloomy one. Earlier this year, directors announced a
profit of some £120.000 for the December half. This means
that only £35,000 was earned in the second half. If the
fi« ires are comoarable (which one hopefully doubts), earnings
seem to be on ffie down-swing again.
Partial Recovery
ffpHE “Golden Fleece” petroleum group, H. C. Sleigh Ltd,
recovered some of the ground lost in 1963-64 and turned
in a 16 p.c. better profit in the year to June 30, 1965.
Profit, which had been over £1.8m. in the two years ended
June, 1962 and 1963, fell to £1.4m. in 1964, and is now
back to £1.65m. Earning rate looks healthier at 13.8 p.c.,
but dividend, which was 1 2\ p.c. in happier days, and was
trimmed to 1 11 p.c. in 1964, has been shaved again to 10 p.c.
Most of the profit improvement was registered in the second
half of the year.
Last month the company announced new arrangements with
Caltex for the purchase and processing of crude oil and the
issue to a Caltex subsidiary of 2,500,000 5s. shares (deferred
C class) at 2s. 6d. premium. Receipt of a total £3.75m. will
provide funds for the development programme and improve
profitability. (For the next seven years these shares are en-
titled to a maximum dividend of 71 p.c.)

SECURITY ANALYSIS
On the Capitalising of Interest
And Lend Lease’s profitability ratios
T)erhaps for the investor one of the
most interesting features in the
beautifully presented annual report of
Lend Lease Corporation Limited for the
year ended June 30, 1965, is the graph
of the market price of the company’s
shares which appears on page five. The
price opened at about 10s. 6d. and closed
at about 95.; apart from a period in Feb-
ruary, 1965, when it reached 11s. 3d.,
this has been the extent of the range.
During 1961 and 1962, there was a dif-
ference of nearly 9s. between the high
and low prices. Times have certainly
changed.
Strangely enough, there has been little
or no reaction to the marked reversal
in the trend in per share earnings which
took place during 1964-65. The earning
rate, which levelled out from 1960-61 to
1961-62, proceeded to fall by 40 p.c.
through to 1963-64, but increased from
12.9 p.c. to 18.3 p.c. in 1964-65. The
shares, however, at the time of writing
(nearly a month after the issue of the
annual report), are still around 9s. 4d.
and at this price they show a dividend
yield of 5.4 p.c. and an earnings yield
of 9.8 p.c. To what extent the lack of
reaction is due to general market condi-
tions is difficult to say. The Sydney All
Ordinary Index is down 14 p.c. on the
level of twelve months ago. If the present
price of Lend Lease shares was increased
so as to eliminate this general fall, the
dividend yield would be 4.6 p.c. and the
earnings yield would be 8.4 p.c. Twelve
months ago, the dividend yield was 5.3
p.c. and the earnings yield 6.9 p.c. So,
depending on whether you are a “divi-
dend” or “earnings” man, the price has
either risen or fallen. Yet, it is quite clear
that on either basis the shares are well
down on their prices of three years ago,
when the dividend yield was 3.3 p.c. and
the earnings yield was 5.6 p.c.
A possible answer to this change in
the stock’s market rating is also given
in the annual report for, on page 22, a
number of ratios and percentages are
given. Some of these are conventional
and some unconventional. The last two
are quite revealing and can be repro-
duced here to advantage:
(Percentages)
Year to June 30 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
Consolidated trading
profit to:
Average total assets 10.0 10.2 7.6 7.4 6.6
Total revenue 17.4 10.5 7.8 7.3 6.9
In a note to this schedule the report
states: “Decline in this ratio (consoli-
dated trading profit to total revenue) is
mainly due to the increase over the period
in construction turnover, which has a
lower profit margin than other group
activities.”
The construction division, which
would appear to consist mainly of Civil
and Civic Pty Ltd, was acquired in
August, 1961. The price was two mil-
lion Lend Lease shares plus 5 p.c. of
Lend Lease’s net profit before tax for
at least twenty years and an annual
amount of £lO,OOO or such other amount
as shall be mutually agreed between Lend
Lease and Brederos Bouwbedrijf, the
vendor of Civil and Civic. At the time
of this issue Lend Lease’s shares were
worth about 18s. on the market, so I
guess that the two million shares were
worth about £1.5 million. Net profit be-
fore tax of the group in the following
year was just over £1 million and 10
p.c. of this figure would be £lOO,OOO.
The value of this annuity at that time
would depend on the rate of discount
to be used in the calculation (which is a
matter of opinion) and the rate of growth
in Lend Lease’s profits from all sources
(including future acquisitions). In very
rough terms, I would suggest that this
annuity would be worth at least ten
years’ purchase or £1 million. Judged
in retrospect, £2.5 million seems a high
price to have paid for such an acquisi-
tion, whose activities seem to have been
the main reason for the fall in the ratio
of consolidated trading profit to total
revenue.
r>Y definition, consolidated trading pro-
fit includes “interest, borrowing ex-
penses and tax”, so the ratio mentioned
in the last paragraph should not be sub-
ject to any considerations concerning
the capitalisation of interest, as all the
other profit ratios must be. While the
practice of capitalising interest is well
established, it is still rather difficult for
the outsider to judge the future effect.
In the case of Lend Lease, the total in-
terest payable is very substantial in re-
lation to consolidated trading profit and
the amount which is capitalised can ob-
viously have quite a dramatic effect:
Year to June 30 1962 1963 1964 1965

Interest charged 375,401 495,022 768,370 610,350
It would be interesting to see the effect
on earnings if this capitalisation had not
taken place. This will probably involve
some adjustment to the tax provision as
well, because it seems possible that, in
the early days, tax was provided as
though the capitalised interest was not
a deductible item.

Estimated tax 104 357 280 350 317
Adjusted earnings 157 536 420 472 430
A glance at the tables at the end of
this article will show that, up to 1964,
the tax provided in the accounts always
exceeded the figure shown above for
“estimated tax”. As this figure was
worked out without regard to the sav-
ings on the first £5,000 of taxable in-
come in each profitable subsidiary and
without knowledge of any tax losses
that might be available, it would be rea-
sonable to say that this figure overstates
the tax liability. However, in the last
two years (and particularly in 1964-65),
the tax provision seems much lower
than it should be. Clearly one cannot
be dogmatic about this, but at least it
can be noted that net profit, before
tax but after all interest, actually fell
in 1964-65.
It would seem that we will have to
wait at least another year before it can
be said with confidence that Lend Lease
has turned the corner and all profit-
ability ratios are again pointing up-
wards.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Not for Impulse Buying
Westfield’s new capital structure
"IV/ffosT significant feature of the 1965
-*■*-*■ accounts of Westfield Development
Corporation Ltd is the change in the
capital structure.
The £75,000 unsecured convertible
notes which carried 9 p.c. interest
matured on July 1, 1965 (just after
balance date), bringing paid capital up
to £527,670.
A sum of £57,500 in debentures
(from an original total of £150,000) will
be repaid before 1966 balance date. The
only long-term liability left will be the
freehold mortgages, which at June 30
totalled £461,200. Freeholds themselves
totalled almost £1 million, of which
approximately half is in the books at
“valuation” and the rest represents
additions at cost.
The object of the company is to
acquire properties, design and construct
buildings, lease, manage and promote
shopping centres. It is mostly concerned
with development of shopping centres,
but also has a motel interest, the Shore
Motel at Artarmon, a Sydney suburb.
Directors preened themselves on the
good relations which the company en-
joyed with “an increasing number of
strong, progressive retailers requiring
shopping accommodation”.
They had in mind G. J. Coles Ltd
(with which Westfield is associated in
several areas), Winns Ltd and latterly
Farmer and Co. Relations were strained,
however, with Mark Fov's Ltd when,
after preliminary negotiations with Foy’s
as the major tenant at the Burwood
centre now under construction, Westfield
decided to grant the tenancy to Farmers.
Choice of tenant is especially im-
portant, as there are escalation clauses
in the leases for rents to rise with turn-
over.
First projects on Westfield’s plate as
from 1960 were the Westfield Plaza
Shopping Centre at Hornsby and the
Artarmon Shore Motel. The Hornsby
centre was to be extended, but due to
the large volume of work in hand in
1965 this has been deferred until early
1966.
In 1963 the company completed
groups of stores for Coles and others
at Blacktown and Yagoona. and a Legacy
branch at Dee Why. In 1964 the Dee
Why and Eastwood Shopping Centres
were added to the investment portfolio.
A lease-back arrangement was made
with a “leading Australian financial in-
stitution” in respect of Eastwood. A
Coles variety store was subsequently
added to the centre.
Next was a supermarket and group
of shops at Baulkham Hills, a depart-
ment store for Winns, and a super-
market at Burwood. The latest report
mentions supermarket projects at Gos-
ford and Lane Cove now under way. A
shopping centre at Figtree (near Wollon-
gong) is about to be opened.
Planning is under way for shopping
projects at Blacktown, Liverpool and
Penrith.
Directors said two years ago that the
investment aspect of the company’s
affairs was becoming more important.
After creating equities in real estate by
developing income-producing properties,
Westfield manages the properties for re-
curring income. The directors likened

the portfolio of investment properties to
an investment company’s portfolio of
shares, but declared that through its
specialised resources Westfield achieves
a cost well below market value, whereas
an investment company purchases its
portfolio at market prices.
One of the most important prospects
for the company’s future, directors con-
tinued, was the growth potential of its
asset values.
As early as 1961 the company re-
valued properties by £104,485. This was
to be used at a later date for the benefit
of shareholders, directors said.
The revaluation appeared rather
premature. Some reluctance to take
account of appreciations in property
values might have appeared better in
investors’ eyes.
The trend towards suburban regional
shopping centres has been pretty well
exploited by now. Westfield has some
strong competition, for instance the
Grace Bros’ Roselands centre. It would
be foolish for investors to believe that
all centres will automatically succeed or
improve in value. Retailing is too com-
petitive today to ensure that. Correct
siting is all-important.
After-tax profit rose in the latest June
year from £79,439 to £91,755, equal to
20.3 p.c. on capital. A 10 p.c. dividend
was paid as usual.
Some of the company’s growth has
been financed by par issues to share-
holders—a one ; for-four in 1961-62 and
a one-for-two the following year.
Although earning rates have always
— in the company’s brief public history
— appeared satisfactory and profits have
exhibited a steadily rising trend, the risks
inherent in the property market should
inhibit directors from thinking of bonus
scrip issues until greater riches have
accumulated.
The 5s. shares are now available at
around 8s.' 6d. where the income return
is 6.0 p.c. and the earnings yield 12.3
p.c. It is not a stock for impulse buying
at this level.

No Bombs on the Floor
Then along comes Chrysler
A GOOD measure of market enthusiasm is the daily volume of shares traded and
in both main capitals this has been around the despairing level of 300,000. No
wonder I thought the market was dull. A few bombs thrown on to the floor, as some
Communists did in Rio de Janiero last Wednesday, may have stirred the Exchanges
into action early in the week.
However, later in the week, as a
partial substitute, Chrysler decided to
release details of its takeover bid for
Rootes (Australia) Ltd.
The bid is one 225. nominal value 5
p.c. third preference share for each 10s.
ordinary share in Rootes (Australia).
Between December, 1968, and March,
1969, these could either be redeemed for
cash at the par value of 225. or ex-
changed for 10s. ordinary shares in
Chrysler Australia on the basis of 72
Chrysler ordinary shares' for each 100
shares. A pretty good deal, especially
if you'd been holding Rootes’ shares
since the beginning of the year, when
they were under 10s.
To me, even now, it's something like
buying BHP at 48s. 6d., and if you’re
not satisfied after three years getting 555.
cash back on each share. On my own
particular purchase of Rootes it was
a case of paying 18s. and expecting to
get back 225. at the end of 1968 if
Chrysler wasn’t shaping up well. In the
meantime I would have been receiving
5 p.c. dividends which on the purchase
price represents an income yield of 6
p.c. If the preference shares were
cashed in during the 1968-69 option
period, the redemption yield (the yield
which takes the capital appreciation into
consideration) is II p.c.
More likely, though, the alternative
offer of Chrysler shares will have the
greater appeal. Based on my purchase
price of 18s. I would ultimately be
getting into Chrysler ordinary 10s. shares
at 255. Of course a lot can happen in
the intervening three years, yet if current
progress is any guide, Chrysler could
could be a much-sought-after share. The
company has just reported a substantial
increase in turnover for the last six
months.
The Australian ordinary shareholding
in Chrysler will only be small. Even if
all former Rootes’ shareholders ultimately
took Chrysler shares instead of cash, it
would only amount to 6.2 p.c. of the
ordinary share capital in Chrysler. What
one might describe as a tightly held
capital situation! In fact, not unlike
Philips and its subsidiary H. Pettiford.
At any price under 195., Rootes seem
an ideal investment for most institutions
[including Reinvestment (Aust.) Ltd], as
well as for the run-of-the-mill investor.
If I’m keen about buying Rootes, I’m
equally keen about selling Keith Harris.
Shareholders have done extraordinarily
well in the past and the credit for the
company’s performance, of course, must
go to the directors. But when these
directors start rewarding each other with
amounts like- £lOO,OOO, shareholders out-
side the family must wonder whether
there should be two classes of shares.
It’s not the first time lump sum pay-
ments have been made to company
executives. In recent times Ready Mixed
Concrete and Amalgamated Chemicals
have shared the headlines on this very
matter. Any shareholder of these two
companies who regarded this action as
a selling signal would now be smiling
down upon his former fellows.
One must come to the conclusion that
these huge lump sum payments are not
generally in the interest of shareholders.
In the same category is the case of
Aberfoyle directors not paying a final
dividend. It’s ludicrous when the 1964-
65 “consolidated” earning rate should be
close to 50 p.c. By selling the shares at
18s. I marked up a loss of £l3.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
200 Aberfoyle, 18/- £176
BOUGHT
200 Rootes, 18/- £lB4
Still a very substantial debit of £542
sitting in the account. It’s the only reason
keeping me out of AOG.

Think of thirty miles of blue
lake cradled in the craggy highlands
of New Zealand’s Southern Alps, its
shores edged with poplars and
green pastures. You’re at the
Wanaka Hotel. 200 miles to the
nearest stock exchange yet
you are living - really living - in a
sumptuous international hotel. The
Wanaka Hotel is one of New
Zealand’s new look resorts, only
recently opened but fast making
a world-wide name for
itself. Why so fast? Because there
are few places on earth where God
given beauty and man-made comfort
so blend to charm and tranquillise
you. And there’s even more to it.
Wanaka is a crossroads. To the
south, a wonderland of lakes and
fjords; We Stop the new Haast Pass
across the Soutt iern Alps to glaciers,
forests - and another dazzling new
resprtidtm at Franz Josef Glacier,
