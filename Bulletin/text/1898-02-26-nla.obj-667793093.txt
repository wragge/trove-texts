THE RED PAGE.
From a new book of verses called ‘ Realms of
Unknown Kings,’ by (Miss) Laurence Alma
Tadema (daughter of the painter ?)■ —
LITTLE GIRLS.
Nobody knows but you and I,
Just you and I and not one more.
They all imagine I’m a child,
And look at me with a grown-up eye,
Just as they did before ;
They none of them see that I never smiled
Or spoke as now I smile and speak :
Yet my very walk must show it!
And none but you and 1 may know it,
Not for a whole long week.
None ; yet do you, too, I wonder,
Peel that the birds know ? The grass?
All the flowers? the blue
Above? and the bough we walk under?
Look well at the sweet silent tilings as we pass.
That butterfly, he knew —
And the goldfinch there, perched up so tall
On the thistle . . . To them we may show it;
Yet nobody else in the world may know it
—Save God, for God knows all.
Here are the words of one of the songs the girls
have just finished singing—
See the Robbers passing by,
Passing by, passing by-
See the Robbers passing by l
My fair La-Ay !
What’s the robbers done to you,
Done to you, done to you ?
What's the Robbers done to you f
My fair La dy !
Stole my watch and stole my chain,
Stole my chain, stole my chain.
Stole my watch and stole my chain,
My fair La-dy !
Off to prison you must go,
You. must go, you must go,
Off to prison you must go l
My fair La-dy l
This is the fashion in which justice is meted out
in some of the child-rhymes. The Lady is haled
off to prison—acted in pantomime, as all the other
incidents are—for having been robbed of her own
watch and chain ! The mention of the latter orna-
ments might suggest that the rhyme had its origin
during the heyday of highwaymen. But the refer-
ence to highwaymen in the plural casts doubt on
this theory. Highwaymen rarely exercised their
profession in bands. Claude Duval worked singly;
so did Dick Turpin, except on rare occasions
when he had an extra large contract on hand.
Then his friend Tom King appeared on
the scene to render valuable assistance.
I am, for my own part, inclined to place the date
when the rhyme was produced as far back as the
period of the Robber Barons. The line
Stoic my watch and stole my chain
might easily be a modernised version of
Stole my rings and chatelaine.
* * * *
But this is a question not to be lightly settled
in a paragraph. Before singing the song given
below, the girls form a large ring, with spaces left
between each girl and her neighbor. In the
centre of the ring stands a girl by herself. This
girl passes out and in through the openings while
the following lines are being chanted :
In and out the window,
In and out the window,
In and out the window—
As you have done before.
The girl who takes the star-part stands in the
ring facing some other girl she has chosen as
partner. The song goes on—
Stand and face your loved one,
Stand and face your loved one,
Stand and face your loved one,
As you have done before.
Then comes —
Follow her to London,
Follow her to London,
Follow her to London,
As you have done before.
The heroine of the little lyric comedy then
marches off to London —situated a few yards
down the street —with her Loved One grasping
her by the skirts and all the rest of the players
following in single file. This small dramatic ditty,
so clearly picturing an elopement in the old style,
may not date back further than a couple of cen-
turies or so. “ Poor Alice weeping for her Sweet-
heart ” and tlie following are possibly of palaeo-
lithic antiquity:—
Here stands a lovely creature I
Who she is I do not know.
Will she answer, for her Beauty —
Will she ansv:er Yes, or No ?
No, she won’t have gold or silver,
No, she won’t have house or land,
21 To, she won’t have ships on the ocean—
All she wants is a nice young man.
Exactly. Talk about the Eternal Feminine !
The Everlasting He occupies the thoughts and
pervades the dreams of the Female of his kind
even in the nursery.
• * * *
And now for the last rhyme and the one I like
best of all—
Here come two Dukes a-riding,
A-ree, a-row, a-riding,
Here come two Dukes a-riding,
To greet your daughter Jane.
My daughter Jane is yet too young,
She has not learnt her mother tongue.
Be she young or be she old,
We her beauty must behold.
Go back, go back, you saucy Jack,
And clean your spurs more brightly.
My spurs are bright and richly wrought.
And in this town they can’t be bought,
And in this town they shan't be s old,
Neither for silver nor for gold.
Go through the kitchen and through the hall,
And choose the fairest one of all.
The fairest one that I can see
Is pretty Nelly. Come to me!
For ‘Nelly,’ read Mary, Annie, or any other
dissyllabic name. And Nelly, or Mary, or Annie
comes, of course, and rides away with the dukes
• —why there should be two dukes to one damsel
may seem strange, but that is how the song goes.
It is, evidently, as old as the days of chivalry,
when the gold was always red, and the ladies
always gay, and the love-affairs of anybody under
the rank of a knight were not thought worth
singing about.
* * * *
Anthropo-philoloKists (horrible coinage but
handy) of the Max Muller school would find in
the foregoing simple, natural ballad-poetry of
childhood, profound and complex meanings too
deep even for clear-obscure exposition—except in
German, t’ut, certainly, they would make of the
lovely creature of the second rhyme the Sanscrit
Aphrodite—t he Latin Venus Genetrix ; Nature,
in fact. And in the heroine of the third rhyme
quoted t hey would see as clearly as the spectacles
on their noses a personification of Ushas the
Vedie dawn-maiden, leading her flock of rosy
clouds over the mountains in the hush of the early
Aryan morning. The Robbers and the Lady, and
the Two Dukes and Daughter Jane, and her
Mother, would also be described by them as solar
myths of the most transparent character. But it
is some years since those antiquarian rag-and-bone
men—those grubbers in neolithic kitchen-middens
—the new school of archaeologists, crushed the
anthropo-philologists and their theories and buried
them beneath a huge heap of prehistoric skulls,
and bones, and flint weapons, and relics of broken
victuals, consumed and digested tens of thousands
of years before Adam ate the apple which the
Woman gave him for the confusion of all mankind,
* * » *
Shall we ever have an Australian child-litera-
ture of song and story that will supersede the old
nursery favorites with their Northern color and
Northern ideality ? Not for five hundred years, I
think. Not until the blackfellow, and the kanga-
roo, and the emu, and the Tasmanian devil, and
the squatter have become, as dim and legendary
and lost in the Grey Vague of Time as the Scan-
dinavian Trolds and the Celtic Fairies are at the
present day. A story that will please a man may
be written in a year or two, a story that will de-
light a woman may be composed in a month or
six weeks, but a story that a child will take to its
heart without question requires a thousand years
to grow to maturity. And, once grown, it out-
lasts dynasties, and Empires, and even languages.
- _ .—-
Edgar Jephson writes in English ‘ To-
Morrow ' —
The intrusive bicycle, substituting in either
case healthy action for unnatural stimulants, has
damaged the sale of patent pills and the literary
drug; has provoked a simultaneous movement
among the manufacturers of either, to make the
retailers sell their goods at net prices ; and lias set
before us more clearly than ever the similarity of
the two trades. This is, indeed, the age of patent
medicines ; and when Keats spoke of the world as
a place ‘ where but to think is to be full of sorrow,’
he was unwittingly pointing out to many worthy
and laborious persons a royal road to fortune and
renown. For, of late years, action, the old and
proper sedative of the malady of thought, has
been growing impossible to greater and greater
numbers of people: you cannot call quill-
driving or counier - jumping action: and the
literary drug is more and more taking its place.
This drug, which is rarely a drug in the market
and still more rarely literature, is of qualities and
prices to suit the different intellects and purses of
those who take it : the office-boy buys it in a
half-penny packet, labelled ‘Comic Cuts,’ the
head of the firm in a four-and-sixpenny packet,
labelled ‘The Christian.’ But its effect is always
the same : it fills the void in the urban mind per-
petually craving to be occupied. For the strain of
city life seems to have robbed the Townsman of
the power of doing nothing with a quiet content;
he can no longer sit still and let his mind wander
idly from thought to thought; unoccupied it fills
with distressful thoughts only, and aches dully.
There is a mental irritation on him that rnußt be
allayed, and he allays it with a literary drug.
* * * •
As with all other drugs, the passion for it grows
with indulgence; it becomes the necessity of life.
Observe the clerks and intelligent artisans in the
carriage of a suburban train, and you will see such
of them as are not in a dull, happy stupor over a
half-penny paper, feverish, with wandering eyes
and fidgetty fingers ; protract the journey for an
hour, and they will grow haggard under the
strain of doing nothing. They should have
interest to fill their thoughts not unpleasantly, at
least they must have their dreams; but their
weakened minds have lost the grip on them, they
are aching for the literary drug. Is it August,
and you are journeying to the sea, observe the
desperate haste of the flurried trippers to arm
themselves against reflection with the weekly
rag-bags ; observe the relief in their faces when
their clammy, urban hands have secure in their
grasp the blue-covered trash. They have probably
been looking forward for weeks to soothing their
street-grimed eyes with the country sights, their
traffic-stunned ears with its sounds; and the
woods and meadows slip by the carriage-windows
unobserved, while they read, with a thirsty satis-
faction, that the flounder lays seven million eggs
in a year; someone cries out at the first sight of
the sea, their indifferent eyes pass swiftly over the
wonder to fall glutted on the wooden antics of the
saw-dust dolls of the ‘ Guinea Story,’
• * * *
[Cf. Calverley’s neatest anti-climax—
Girls’ Song-Games.
Writes Victor Daley :—
As I sit smoking by an open window of a cot-
tage in a quiet suburban street I hear the voices
of a group of girl-children on the other side of the
way singing the child-songs that were sung by
their mothers and grandmothers—and by possibly
a far-stretching line of ancestresses who had also
their days of youth, but have long since passed
into the Herebefore. The songs are for the most
part as direct in statement as the old ballads in
the ‘Percy Reliques.’ They have, too, the cheer-
ful inconsequence in the matter of refrain, and
the delight in repetition, which are such conspicu-
ous features of some of the old ballads that have
come down to us. These qualities are to be found
in the primitive poetry of all races. Savages of
the present day will sit and listen complacently
by the . hour to chants containing but one
idea, stated over and over again. But think
of our music-halls, and the dreadful ditties
without any idea at all sung in them nightly
to delighted audiences ! The blackest and
most benighted African seems to be, in regard
to his taste in song-material, far superior to the
average Britannic citizen.
» * * *
Children of civilised or so-called civilised
parents are simply small savages writhing in the
bonds of petticoats or knickerbockers. Therefore
they are satisfied with their own traditional
literature ; in fact, when they are by themselves,
and not under the compelling eyes of parents or
teachers, will have nothing to do with any other.
The most charming of songs and stories have been
written for children during the present century —
(in previous centuries children were regarded as
little nuisances, and were sent to bed early out of
the way of their elders)—but they have been given
a cold reception by the small public for whom
they were written. It is, indeed, questionable
if many of Hans Andersen’s stories have been
taken to the hearts of the children, even in Den-
mark and Germany. But ‘ Jack and the Bean-
stalk,’ and ‘Jack the Giant-Killer,’ and the
‘ Three Bears,’ and ‘Little Red Riding Hood,’
and ‘Cinderella,’ will probably outlast the life of
the tremendous British Empire, and be heard
with unabated interest by the children living in an
age when the plays of imperial Shakespeare will
be known to only the Bookworms and Dryasdusts
of the period.
* * * *
The vitality of these child-stories seems almost
miraculous. It would be quite so if it were not
for the fact that the human raoe—in spite of
homocultnre, and scientific training, and no end
of other nauseous specifics for turning men into
machines—is continually beginning at the be-
ginning and passing through several years of
healthy, happy, irresponsible barbarism before it
takes up the yoke of Civilisation. If the authors
of ‘Jack and the Beanstalk,’ and ‘Little Red
Riding Hood,’ and ‘Cinderella’—the latter
known in other lands and languages as Avislang
and Rhodope and by many other ni/mei —
had only arranged with their publishers
(and the heirs and executors of the same
to the thousandth generation) for a royalty
on the sale of their works, to be paid to their de-
scendants in scecula sceculorum, those descendants
would about own the earth by this time. But
even the names of these wonderful authors are as
lost to us as the name borne by Hercules when he
sojourned amongst women, or the -secret name of
PEACE: A STUDY.
He stood, a worn-out city clerk—
Who’d toil’d, and seen no holiday,
For forty years from dawn to dark—■
Alone beside Caermarthen Bay.
He felt the salt spray on his lips;
Heard children’s yoices on the sands;
Up the sun’s path he saw the ships
Sail on and on to other lands ;
And laugh’d aloud. Each sight and sound
To him was joy too deep for tears;
He sat him on the beach, and hound
A blue bandana round his ears
And thought how, posted near his door,
His own green door on Camden Hill,
Two bands at least, most likely more,
Were mingling at their own sweet will
Yerdi with Vanoe. And at the thought
He laugh'd again, and softly drew
That • Morning Herald ’ that he’d bought
Forth from his breast, and read it through.]
These are they whose mental craving is dulled
by the coarsest and cheapest forms of the drug ;
but the spread of enlightenment, the University
Extension Lectures, and even more the custom of
employing more servants in the households of
well-to-do tradesmen, have formed a largesuburban
class, chiefly women, of greater leisure; and for
them the drug must not only be wrapped in
dearer packets, but it must be of more stimulating
properties. Bare incident, threadbare jokes, and
bald, unessential information do not fill comfort-
ably their mental void ; tl ey n quire their novi Is
to deal with ‘Burning Questions,’ the ‘Complex
Problems of our Modernity,’ and other fine-sound-
ing drivel. Some puritanical twist of mind, in-
herited probably from dissenting ancestors, makes
them prefer that their fiction should inspire into
them the feeling that they have been spending
profitably their time in absorbing great truths;
and. they, arise from a perusal of Miss Corelli’s
atomic theory ‘cultured.’
♦ * * *
For all the dearness of the packet, cheapness is
the striking quality of its contents : cheap thought,
cheap fancy, cheap character, cheap pathos, cheap
humor, all cheaply presented. Literature, the. fine
handling of life, does not appeal to these readers;it
displeases them rather ; they are flying from life.
Insight into human nature* shocks them; the
truth pains them ; they are 1 lind to beauty. But
after all husks are quite filling.
*•* - - *
It is the fashion to feel, or to affect, a fine anger
against the manufacturers of the literary drug. It
may be righteous ; but it is rather a waste of a
good passion. Their pretensions are irritating,
doubtless; but after all not more irritating than a
near barrel-organ. When the blaze of the boomster,
swelling the volume of undying trumpeters, is
sonorous over the land, the turning a deaf ear to
it is more sensible than wailirlg of Literature dis-
graced by self-advertisement. Literature is not
touched. When, as you row up the Thames, the
black Beeeham hoard, flanked by the appro-
priately bilious Carter board, starts up in a
u> adow and importunes the eye, you do not wail
at the disgrace to medicine, you look at the
meadows on the other side. Miss Corelli and
Caine are as necessary to the vulgar as Beeeham
and Carter —the former fill, the latter empty—
surely they may push their wares in the fashion
that draws best the money from the pockets of
their customers. Rather admire their advertising
skill, their sympathetic knowledge of the great
heart of the vulgar, of the claptrap that appeals
to it; cease to wonder, and, above all, cease to
be angry that Miss Corelli has sold her thousands,
Mr. Caine his ten thousands.
Amen to all that.

H.C.C.: “ You ask ‘ Which of Austin Dobson’s
is the best English rondeau? ’ I like this one, un-
earthed in 1887 from ‘ Harper’s ’ of June, 1885 :
TO A JUNE ROSE.
O royal Rose ! the Reman dress’d
His feast with thee: thy petals press’d
Augustan brows ; thine odor fine,
Mixed with the three-tiim'S-mingled wine,
Lent the long Thracian draught its zest.
What, marvel then, if host a.nd guest,
By Love, by Song, by Thee caress’d,
Half-trembled on the half-divine,
O royal Rose 1
And yet—and yet—l love thee best
In our old gardens of the West,
Whether about my thatch thou twine
Or Hers, that brown-eyed maid of mine,
Who lulls thee on her lawny breast,
O royal Rose! ”
[ln the collected edition line 7 appears as
By Song, by Joy, by Thee caress’d.
Probably our author reflected that the Roman
didn’t let Love in till after the feast—he ‘never
mixed.’ Or possibly he reflected that the intro-
duction of Love in the middle made Love at the
close an anti-climax.]

without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”

completed his studies in the leading hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long

quickest and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He has, by his unequalled success, during
a period of many years, obtained the highest position in his profession. The various diseases
embraced in his speciality are those which have hitherto caused more misery and suffering
than any other kind of trouble that affects the human frame.

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure Is certain.
“ Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. ~At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“ After suffering from Asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883, 14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cured me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria. ”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power. ” Signed by
the Rev. John Sinclair, Myers-street, Geelong, and 59
other leading residents.

prietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria.

A widow living in a lonely cottage nrn.
Narrabri (N.S.W.) reported to the police, a f' -
days ago, that her bedroom was invaded, late o;
Saturday night, after she had retired to bed ar
presumably put out the light, by a naked al>
riginal. He chased her out of the house, tried t
strangle her in the darkness outside, and the;
when her screams attracted attention, he evap
rated into the night. Early on Monday mormr.
~he police arrested an aboriginal 28 miles awa;
and ran him in. There should be room for son>
tine feats of identification in this incident. Tb
night was black ; the burglar was black ; the took
aoparently, was black also. The black intrude
ran after the widow into the blackness outsid-
and then disappeared. And yet lots of peop
positively identify lots of other people under ci
uumstances exactly like this.
LOVE’S MOLOCH.
How long shall we hear the sobbing?
How long shall our hearts beat slow
To the wail of a ceaseless sorrow
That follows us to and fro,
Who watch from our safe rock-ramparts
The wreck of the ringless brides
On the flow of the crimson sunsets,
On the ebb of the white moon-tides?
They walk in the weeping darkness,
They hold on a wasted arm
What Love cannot guard from hunger
Or Passion itself keep warm ;
They walk in the weeping darkness,
They clasp to their breasts of shame
The pitiful white-faced burdens
The world will refuse to name.
They bend to the wee wan faces,
And scald with their burning tears
The tiny lips that will curse them
When knowlec’gi has come with years ;
They weep by their rocking cradles
Whose labor should prove so sweet,
And the wealth of their white girl-garland?
Lies crushed at the gray world’s feet.
They creep to our curtained windows,
They stand at our doors, thrice-barred ;
And their feet are torn and bleeding
Who found that their path was hard.
Their hands that we held may touch us,
Their lips that we loved may plead,
But never an ear will hearken,
And never a heart will heed.
They shrink from the glaring sunlight,
But down where the lamps are lit
They stretch a hand to their sorrow,
And drink to the deeps of it;
There are sins that the night will pardon,
And smiles for the roses red,
Oh ! Woe to the maiden-mothers !
And Woe to the bonds unsaid 1
How long shall we lead the victims ?
How long in a crimson flood
Shall the gates of our great Gomorrah
Be washed in our sisters’ blood ?
How long shall they heap the altars ?
How long shall their cry be heard
Ere the fire and the brimstone teach us
That the anger of God be stirred ?
WILL H. OGILVIE.
A SONG OF LOVE.
Why is it, sweet, that ever hearts will sadden
Just in the rapture of the purest bliss ?
Why is it that thy music cannot gladden
The hot remembrance of a stolen kiss ?
That when my arm thy throbbing form embrao-*-.
And all is happiness and rest supine,
A vision as of death and weeping faces
Comes right between thy laughing eyes ana
mine?
A glimpse of winter through the golden maze
Of summer days.
I listen to the song that you are singing,
And all around the world is gay and fair,
Yet, as the notes caressingly are ringing
In joyous freedom through the mellow air,
It seems to me as if some sombre moral,
A sound of sobbing faintly underlay
The triumph and the glory of the choral
That tells exultingly of summer’s sway.
As if some chord (so soon, my God, so soon)
Were out of tune !
A gloomy shadow on the sunlit hours;
In warm, confiding hearts a sudden chill ;
A drop of poison in the brightest flowers ;
A dark presentiment of coming ill.
Ah, sing no more! Though deep the lov
treasure,
And sweet thy music—at some eerie call
There rises, even from the midst of pleasure.
A nameless something, bitterer than gall,
And pours its sadness into, line for line,
That song of thine.

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1898.
A Word for Australia.
Those good Englishmen, and Irishmen, and
Scotchmen who are arranging our Federal
destiny have so little imagination—so little
imagination. And the two or three Australians
who leaven the lump are as bad, for they belong
mostly to the old generation which drew strength
and impetus from England, which nourishes Aus-
tralian ideals (if it nourishes them), despite its
mental habits and its training. While there is
yet time, The Bulletin speaks one word for
the New Generation, for the Young Men, for
the great and growing, though as yet inarticu-
late, class for whom this our country is Home,
the only Home they know, the Home which
they love ardently, and in whose future they
trust. For, no matter what superficial critics
think and say, our Young Men are not wholly
wrapped up in sport, are far from wholly un-
concerned as to the business of nation-making
now proceeding under their eyes. But they
still have to find themselves, and their Voice.
• * * *
With Heaven knows what groanings and
contortions the Federal delegates have at last
resolved to practically leave the control of the
continent’s rivers to the continent’s govern-
ment. And throughout all the clamor which
preceded the decision, though many men rose
to advocate the rights of New South Wales, or
of Victoria, or of some other province, there
was not found one man to rise and say : “ Damn
New South Wales and the rest ! I Represent
Australia ! ” That obvious utterance was
beyond the capacity of the most capable delegate
of them all. And the Conference’s attitude to
this question is its attitude to all. The settle-
ment of financial differences is postponed for the
present, but only because, after all the un-
imaginative heads had striven for months, they
found themselves unable to split the odd half-
penny. They dearly desired to split the odd
halfpenny. So throughout. The debates have
been full of arguments that so much was due
to this province and the other, and quite empty
nof reference as to what was due to the Commo-
wealth of all the provinces. The claim of
Australia was first and last and sole reason for
the meeting of the Convention, and all efforts
are devoted to upholding the claims of this
or that fragment of Australia.
* * * *
The time has come for more enlightened
efforts to a grander end. Only knaves or fools
would wish to perpetuate division in the very
hour of union. It is true that, in a political
sense, some of the Convention delegates are
foolish, some are knavish. They are so used
to look at the province beyond the border as
an enemy that it is impossible for them to
change the point of view, no matter what lofty
ideal tempts or urges. Or they believe that
their own personal interests are bound up with
the perpetuation of provincialism, and fear that
confederation will diminish their political im-
portance or their political profits. And pro-
vincial hostility has been so long inflamed by
Parliaments and by the press that a section of
the people has been infected with the poli-
ticians’ jealousy, and sees through the poli-
ticians’ squinting eyes. But what intelligent
young native of any province is there who does
not regard himself, first and foremost, as a
native of Australia, does not reckon all Aus-
tralians as brethren, is not careless what hap-
pens so long as Australian interests are served
—knowing that the welfare of all the provinces
must involve the welfare of each, and that indi-
vidual losses will not be a drop in the bucket of
the general gain ? Our artificial boundaries,
and restrictions on intercourse, and obstacles to
community, will have to meet destruction
sooner or later, and the longer they remain the
greater will be the difficulty and cost of
removal. Federation is a return to nature and
the natural order. Who does not see that the
single vital element in the Federal scheme is
the need for its speedy consummation, on any
terms or on none ?
* * * *
The Tories, the fogies, the men of the Old
Generation, call Federation a leap in the dark.
It is a leap out of the dark—cannot but be
towards the light. Why, then, carry the pro-
vincial prejudices forward to the account of the
new era ? The writer was born in one Austra-
lian province; has lived in two others ; has
travelled in all six ; and he honestly declares
that lie is only technically aware that boun-
daries exist—he has no preference—the justice
that he would give one he would give all—to
him they are all Australia. And he multiplies
himself by the New Generation, and by the
Newer Generation, and by the Generation yet
Unborn, and confidently affirms that Australia
can trust Australia, that Australians can trust
themselves. And if, without any condition
or reservation whatever, the map of Australia
were to-morrow colored one uniform tint, to-
day’s green and to-day’s blue and to-day’s
yellow would gain equally, and the trifling loss
due to substitution of a natural for an unnatural
state of things would, in proportion to the gain,
be indistinguishable.
• * * *
The financial and commercial and national
profits of Federation have been often insisted
on, but the fact that Federation means a lessen-
ing of the very gravest national danger has
been less stressed. Nobody knows just what
would happen to this country in the event of
European war involving Britain ; but the risk
is (the word is measured) terrible. Whether
we separate from Britain or remain allied with
her, that risk remains ; and our present situa-
tion is nothing but an invitation to attack.
With a handful of fifth-rate vessels to defend
thousands of mile of coast-line; with a meagre
and inefficient military force, divided under
six separate commands ; without arsenals,
weapons, ammunition, or the means of making
them ; with broken-gauge railways to impede
mobilisation; with wealthy coastal cities prac-
tically unfortified, and with agricultural and
mineral land which is a rich bait to a colonising
invader; our position is on the very edge of a
precipice. Federation would not put us out of
risk, but it would help. And the risk is so
tremendous that anyone who has taken the
least trouble to comprehend it cannot but rage
at the petty-minded political “leaders” who
squabble over the details of provincial property
when at any moment we may be called on to
fight for our national existence. In time of
peace this language may seem strong; how
weak it would seem in war-time ! The man
perhaps the most competent to judge it who
has ever been in Australia, soldier-statesman
Henry Norman, has endorsed every word.
The longer The Bulletin lives the keener
grows its sense of Australia’s danger under
existing conditions. But the excellent English-
men and Irishmen and Scotchmen who are
arranging our Federal destiny are concerned
merely with the things right under their noses
—the odd halfpenny and the odd bucket of
water. Alas ! they have so little imagination.
Land Auctions.
The announcement of N.S.W. Government
that it will hold a tremendous series of auction
sales on the 29th and 30th March is an example
of how an animal disrespectfully mentioned in
Scripture returns to a certain substance that is
too unpleasant to mention. There are to be
auction sales on these two days at 62 separate
towns. Over 1000 lots are to be offered, all in
the Eastern and Central Divisions, the average
size of the allotments being about 110 acres.
The total area to be thrown on the market is
111,648 acres, at an average upset price of 255.
an acre, and it is expected that the sale will
pan out for something like £200,000. There
are no conditions as regards residence or im-
provement ; the only stipulation is that the
purchase money is all to be paid inside three
months—in other words, it is all to arrive in
the Treasury by June 30, the last day of the
financial year, just in time to help reduce the
Reid deficit, or to help at making a Reid sur-
plus. Most of the land will probably, there-
fore, be grabbed by large landholders, banks,
financial companies, and private speculators
in other words, by tbe class which has ready
money. The small agriculturist, as a rule,
hasn’t much ready money, and can’t pay up
inside three months.
In the old days—the good days of drunken
inflation and boom and riot which so many
people insist on regarding as the normal condi-
tion of the country (hence, when the country
got into a more natural condition, they in-
sisted on calling it “depression”)—land-sales
and borrowing were the sources of N.S.W.’s
alleged prosperity. Work was plentiful then
because the Government found a billet for
almost every able-bodied man who wanted one
at making roads, railways, and bridges, at
building up and digging out; and paid his
wages with borrowed money, or with money
obtained by throwing the public estate whole-
sale at whoeyer would pay for it. Wages were
high, because the Government took so many
men off the general labor-market that those
who remained were in strong demand. Taxes
were low, for the land-sale money paid half,
and sometimes more than half, the expenses of
government. Until the collapse of the first
great Foreign-trade regime at the end of 1892,
and the advent of the three Governments of
which Dibbs was the leading figure the
Stuart-Dibbs Ministry of 1883-85, the Dibbs
Ministry of 1885, and the Jennings - Dibbs
Ministry of 1886—the sale of public lands raged
furiously, and there were good times in the
Treasury, and a great and glorious burst all the
way from Eden to Milparinka.

From these figures it would appear that the
present N.S.W. Government has, so far, the
best record in this particular direction. But,
having sacrificed a great sum in customs revenue
to appease its friends, the Calico Jimmies of
Sydney, and not being able to raise enough
direct taxation to fill the gap, and finding it
impossible to charge quite everything to loans,
and having used up the expedient of leaving
part of this year’s bills over to next year on a
Cash Basis, and the other expedient of collect-
ing two years’ income-tax in one year, and find-
ing the annexation of the Education Fund in-
sufficient to cover the yawning void, it has to
get back, after all, to the old, easy, corrupt re-
source of land-jobbing on a big scale, as
practised in the old, gay, crooked days of
Parkes, and Garrett, and Ezekiel Baker,
and John Davies—he of the famous Three
Hats.
* * * •
The huge auction of next month is to be a
bigger sacrifice of the public estate in two days
than has ever taken place in a whole year since
1883, when Stuart and Dibbs made their
famous effort at reform. The great objection
to the auction system is that it is purely and
simply an expedient for obtaining money.
It doesn’t necessarily imply settlement or im-
provement, for there are no conditions attached
except the condition that the money shall be
paid up very suddenly so as to prevent the
Foreign-trade regime being discredited by
another deficit. It doesn’t profess to do any-
thing in the way of restraining monopoly or
encouraging production—it is nothing at all
save a desperate device for raising cash. This
reversion on a large scale to the worst kind of
land-jobbery is not what was expected of a
Ministry which made such large professions on
the subject of land reform ; certainly it was
not expected that that Ministry would go in
for the most wholesale sacrifice of the public
estate that has been attempted in the last 15
years. This one sale will more than equal (in
two days) all the auction sales done by Stuart
and Dibbs in three years. And, in addition to
this, the Government is endeavoring to raise
another .£40,000 or more by the sale of certain
city lands—so apparently a quarter-million
is wanted by next June, and wanted darned
bad.
* « * *
Barring the three Ministries of 1883-86, in
which Dibbs was the strong man and chief
financier, no N.S.W. Government for about a
quarter of a century has made any great effort
to swear off the evil habit of living on the easy
throwing away of the public estate. There
were variations, certainly, in the modes of
throwing it away, and some modes were worse
than others, but the results didn’t differ widely.
In 1881 and 1882, when the land policy was at
its worst, Parkes realised about £2,800,000 per
year by putting the soil up the spout. In 1883
Stuart and Dibbs sacrificed £1,200,000 of
revenue by the almost entire stoppage of
auctions, and during the Dibbs, Stuart, and
Jennings regime the public estate was so care-
fully conserved that the revenue derived from
it averaged only £1,600,000 per annum—the
lowest figure recorded in the last 23 years. But
the attempt to impose direct taxation in order to
make up the loss failed through the bitter opposi-
tion of the old Parkes Foreign-trade party. The
ad valorem duties which were put on instead
were insuflScient, and they brought down on
the Government the bitter rage of the Sydney
shoddy press. The want of revenue laid the
first foundations of the “ Dibbs deficit,” about
which so much has since been heard. Hardly
anybody recollects now that the more or less
Dibbs Ministries of 1883-86 sacrificed nearly
£5,000,000 of revenue in trying to put down
the miserably-extravagant land-auction sys-
tem ; that fact has been so carefully concealed
by the daily papers of Sydney that the only
thing remembered about these Ministries is
certain small unpaid liabilities they left behind
them. Then Parkes came back to power, and
proceeded to save the country and straighten
the finances by raising £700,000 a year
more land - revenue, and throwing away
the public estate at the rate of £2,300 000
per annum. The New South Wales land-
revenue, of late years, has averaged
from £1,900,000 to £2,000,000 annually. But
the worst feature of the system—the great
auction dodge—seemed to have almost entirely
died out ; after the violent shutting-down
effected by Stuart and Dibbs, in 1883, no one
—not even Parkes— dared to start it again on
the old scale, and the Reid Ministry, though it
raised about the usual £1,900,000 or £2,000 000
a year off the land, kept this particular
evil at a minimum. But now, appar-
ently the dire necessities of the imported
Shoddy regime call for a resumption of the old
gaudy policy, with its smellful reminiscences of
the bad old rum-and-curse days that are de-
parted.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Tasmania’s Maximum Wage.
The minimum-wage question has never yet
struck Tasmania, but the maximum wage
in that lovely Land of Dreams is fixed by the
Chief Justice. As thus : The C.J., as chair-
man of the bush-fires Relief Committee and
Lord High Apportioner of the publicly-sub-
scribed funds, lately ukased that four shillings
a day is to be the maximum wage for those
burnt-out settlers and others who may be em-
ployed re-building fences and houses in the fire-
devastated districts. But as the Government
employes in some of those districts—road-
repairers, bridge men, &c.—were being paid at
the rate of six shillings a day, some dissatis-
faction naturally ensued. Quote :
.Representations were, however, made to the Minister
of Lands and Works upon the point, and Mr. Pillinger
at once gave instructions to have a proper rate resorted
to by the officers of the department under his charge.
That the Van Dobson, whose own minimum-
wage is fixed by Act of Parliament at about
£4 a day, should consider four shillings a day
a “ proper ” maximum for Bill Smith, is pro-
bably what Bill Smith expected and deserved ;
but that Jim and Joe, and all the other
six-bob-a-day chaps in blucher boots would
be sweated a third of their munificent
salaries in the sacred cause of Charity, not
even a burnt-out Bill Smith would have con-
sidered probable. Yet if Bill had brains as
well as, or in lieu of, bluchers, he would note
that a third of the C.J.’s screw is £SOO, and
that £lO is all that appears in' the published
list as the measure of his sacrifice. But the
beauties of private charity are lost on the aver-
age person who sweats and wears bluchers, and
it isn’t much use preaching at him yet. For the
present, we can find food for thought in noting
how the Shadows of the Old Regime cling to
Tasmania under the Van Dobson ditto.
Confusion.
The further the Federal Convention struggles
along the path to brotherhood, the more foolish
appears the policy of leaving the public debts
under State control. The policy of leaving the
railways under separate State control is still
more foolish so far as concerns the future
prosperity of the interior, but with regard to
the financial muddle under immediate con-
sideration the federation of the debts is the
first essential. The situation boils down into
these four propositions :
(1) The Federal Government will have the sole right to
collect customs and excise revenue. Therefore, the pro-
vinces hand over a source of income which yields at
present about £7,000,000 a year. They will also be
relieved of expenditure to the extent of about £1,600,000
a year.
(2) If the debts, or the bulk of them, were handed over,
the provinces would give up £7,000,000 a year of revenue
and be relieved of about the same expenditure. The
Federal Government would be responsible for raising the
needful revenue to meet the interest on the debt. Having
the sole right to levy customs and excise it could raise
the cash that way, or, if it preferred, it could do it by
direct taxation. The fiscal issue would be left absolutely
open.
(3) Under the proposed system the Federal Government
may collect so much revenue that it will be able to return
the States enough out of the surplus to pay the interest
on their debts. On the other hand it may not. In the
latter case some of the States dun no where they are.

The Beginning of the End.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are Envoys, China, knocking at thy gate!
While the Western world that lies beyond thy wall
Took the puissance of thy mysteried power on
trust,
Stood the Mongol’s ancient realm immune from
thrall,
Though the dynasties around it bit the dust ;
But the veil that hid thy palsied throne from sight
In the neighbouring lands showed threadbare
to the sun—
Then the chimera of centuries took flight,
And the race to parcel China was begun.
Hence the presence of the Envoy at the gate.
When the conqueror of old had marked a prey,
t He was wont to wheel his legions into line—
‘ Behold ! ” he said, “ let me but grasp the bay,
The golden spoils of victory be thine ! ”
And the quarry stood to watch the war-cloud
break,
Prepared to meet and wrestle with the foe;
The ravisher fought boldly for the stake,
The victim knew the issue of the blow.
But the witless days of iron buried lie,
And wilier brains direct the “ game of kings ”;
No herald’s trump proclaims invasion nigh,
The overture is played on muted strings ;
A righteous-visaged Presence, labelled “ Trade,”
Moves out from where the loaded Maxims stand,
With treasure-chest to proffer friendly aid
To tap the golden founts that stud the land.
There are unfamiliar voices at the gate.
China, the Smooth-faced Presence fronts thee now,
And scans the Flowery Land with amorous
glance;
He wears a dual crown upon his brow,
Lion and Bear divide his cognizance.
Haply some respite on the suit may wait,
The while the game of Royal Brag is played,
But both the gamesters hold the trumps of fate,
And stand to win upon a hand of Trade ;
And their Envoys now are posted at the gate.
Strip the lustre off your shrines and ye are wise—
Forthe Smooth-faced Oneall other idols mocks—
Hide the gems—he hath a key whose art defies
The cunning of your children and their locks;
Eat, drink, and merry be while yet you may.
The to-morrow is but short that ye can boast,
For the Envoys at the gate have come to stay,
And the convoys of their masters line the coast.
Hark / the Envoys wax impatient at the gate.
Brisbane.
P.J.D.


that it will do its best to persuade the Federal Govern-
ment to practically abolish customs duties, on the ground
that N.S.W. can live on its land revenue and its borrow-
Jng-s, and it doesn’t need to care whether the other States
live or not.
This makes a highly interesting complication,
and Ihe Bulletin infers from it that the
Commonwealth ought to make matters clear by
taking over all or a large portion of the public
debts. At the same time, the matter
isn’t worth quite all the row that is being
made about it. If the Foreign - trade
party captures the Federal Government,
and it won’t raise a big customs revenue,
and the separate provinces have no longer the
power to levy customs-duties, and they have
their iuterest to pay, and have lost the usual
means of paying it, the only thing left to do is
for the States to send in to the Federal Trea-
surer a general intimation that they are going
broke. Then the central Government would
take over the debts, for the sake of maintain-
ing its blessed credit in London, and the matter
would end quite simply and naturally. If the
central Government didn’t make its arrange-
ments quickly enough, and some of the pro-
vinces actually broke before things were
fixed up, it would give Australian credit
in London a shock which it has wanted
very badly for a long time. Apparently,
Australia wfill keep on borrowing in London
until Bull gets such a shock that he won’t lend
any more, and the very worst kind of a shock
is urgently needed. Therefore, The Bulletin’s
theory is : (1) That the Federal Government
ought to take over the debts, or the bulk of
them, now, for the sake of the possible saving
in interest; (2) at the same time, if it doesn’t
do this now it will almost certainly do it later
on ; (3) if it doesn’t do it later on the results
should be a highly interesting study, and this
paper wouldn’t miss seeing it for a good deal.
Anyhow, the matter is certainly not important
enough to be a fair excuse for blocking Federa-
tion.
\ A Tape-Worm Specialist.
LiAs't week the N.S.W. Full Court confirmed a
sentence of six months passed by Judge Docker
on an alleged tape-worm specialist. “Madame ”
Kingston, the specialist in question, be-
longed to the tribe of practitioners who go
into trances, or discover the state of the
patient’s inside by communication with the
spirits, or get information by palmistry, or who
communicate with the ghost of a deceased
grandmother. She fastened on to Mrs. Stewart,
and told her that she had 503 worms in
her body, three of them being large and
aggressive tape - worms. She sold large
quantities of medicine to Mrs. Stewart,
and professed to extract worms out of her
wholesale by various operations. Unluckily,
the patient got away with a bottleful of the
alleged worms, which proved to be white of
egg, and the result was six months’ light labor.
So utterly quack-ridden is N.S.W. that a law-
yer actually appealed on the ground that
getting money by false pretences in this manner
was not a false pretence “ within the meaning
of the Act,” and tried to demonstrate that the
proceeding was perfectly legitimate. What
most people will wonder at is that the prisoner
(she was tried by Judge Docker— a gentleman
who, when in anything like good condition,
dashes tremendous sentences about in the most
lavish fashion) didn’t get three years at the
very least. Many a poor wretch has got three
/ears for raising =63 15s. by false pretences
without aggravating his crime by telling the
victim that her inside was full of reptiles, and
keeping her in a grievous state of alarm, and
performing operations on her, and filling her
with horrid medicines, and possibly endanger-
ing her life by preventing her resorting to
proper medical advice, and finally insulting her
by professing to extract bottles-full of worms
from her. Judging by the sentence it would
appear that N.S. W. law regards all these un-
pleasant proceedings as rather a mitigation of
the offence than otherwise.
The Joneses and Smiths of Politics.
The decision of N.S.W. Labor Electoral League
to go in bald-headed for the abolition of the
Leg. Council is vastly better than leaving the
Council as it is, or than reforming it on the 25-
year nomination basis—still it has serious draw-
backs. It would leave the Assembly in sole
possession, and the curse of the Assembly is
that it doesn’t even pretend to represent N.S.
Wales. It is made up of 125 men who repre-
sent a spot apiece, and each man is charged
with looking after the separate interests of his
separate spot. But any matter which doesn’t
affect one single spot but N.S.W. in general
is nobody’s business, consequently there isn’t
one strong Federationist in the whole Assembly.
The only great and eloquent Federationist
N.S.W. possesses was thrown out of the popular
Chamber because he was of no special use to
Gum-tree Flat or Old Dry Plain, and he had to
become a nominee councillor to prevent' him
being thrown out of politics altogether. N.S.W.
badly wants a House that will represent all
N.S.W.—the whole of it, voting by manhood
suffrage as one constituency—not merely Old
Dry Creek or Hog Vale individually. Then
its members would have to get in on their own
merits, because no man could keep a grocery-
shop all over N.S.W., or provide culverts for
all N.S.W., or kiss all the infants in N.S.W.
In short, it wants a House that it can put its
great men into, when it has any. At present
it has no place to put them. But as such a
House would necessarily overshadow the purely
parochial Assembly, and reduce the member
for Old Dry Plain to insignificance, there is
very little chance of it being created. The
average M.L.A. is a poor creature who wants
either to have an Upper House which is so
dull and Tory and unrepresentative and intel-
lectually barren that it will make him look
almost a brilliant statesman by comparison, or
else to have none at all, so that there will be
no room for invidious comparisons. The three
Joneses, and the two Smiths, and Whiddon,
and Wilks, and ex-preacher Smailes are at
home in a small, mean, parochial political
Bvstem, and there would be no place for them
in anything better. Ami no one expects the
three Joneses and the two Smiths to yearn for
the elevation of the Legislature into an affair
With any national soul in it.
More About Thrift.
The Weekly Press (Christchurch, M.L.) thus
re-states the case for Thrift, and the Tory plea
against the Seddon Government’s Old Age
Pension scheme :
All property is the result of labor and thrift. Taxes
come from labor or savings. If the aged poor are paid a
pension out of the taxes, those who save keep them. If
there are two workmen who get equal wages, and one
puts by a sixpence a week from the time he is 21 till he is
65 he will have a pension that will keep him. The other
workman, instead of putting past his sixpence a week,
spent it, it may be in drink, or tobacco, or amusements—
at 65 he has no pension. If the Government steps in and
says to this penniless man “ here is a pension for you
equal to what your fellow-workman has got by his
own saving,” is that right ? Surely if there is one
of the two to be rewarded the man who has been inde-
pendent, self-regarding and thrifty should be rewarded.
But no, some people say that the man who refused to
put anything by for a rainy day should receive a reward,
and the other get not even thanks for his self-denial.
That is not all ; the taxes come from labor and saving,
and the man who gets no pension has to pay part of
his small fund his saving to help to keep his mate
because his mate w'ould not save.
Almost every case has another side to it, and
The Bulletin hereby presents the other side
to the above. All property is not the result of
labor and thrift. The most valuable part of
every nation’s property is the land and the
natural water-supply, and neither labor nor
thrift made these. Taxes in a great measure
come from vice instead of labor and savings ; in
Maoriland, the great bulk of them are derived
from the consumption of drink and tobacco and
imported luxuries ; through tote - gambling,
through fines for disorderly conduct and the
like—in fact, out of about £2,800,000 revenue
raised by taxes of all kinds, just about half-
a-million are paid by the thrifty. And, in-
stead of the thrifty man paying away part of
his small fund in his old age “ to help to keep
his mate because his mate would not save,” it is
the other way about; the spendthrift is paying
all his life, by his contributions to the drink
and tobacco and cigar and tote revenue, and
the revenue derived from duties on innumerable
luxuries, to support the man who does save.
The really saving man—the one who doesn’t
drink or smoke or gamble or get fined or buy
luxuries to eat or drink or wear—contributes
hardly anything to the revenue ; the thriftless
man pays practically everything for him. And,
when the latter grows old, and gets the pen-
sion that he has earned by his thriftlessness
dozens of times over, it isn’t the thrifty man
who pays for it; it is paid for almost wholly by
the new generation of thriftless men who are
again keeping the revenue going. The thrifty
man, in this connection, is a lying, grasping
fraud all round. In any case, what does the
Tory propose to do with the old penniless
spendthrift? If he shouldn’t be maintained
at the public cost per medium of a very small
State pension, it is equally immoral to main-
tain him at the public cost in a hospital
or refuge or a benevolent asylum, or by pro-
miscuous charity. If as a pensioner he is a
burden on the Thrifty, he is also a burden as
a pauper. Therefore, there are only two logical
courses to be followed. One is that the ancient
who has no money should starve to death in
some place where the sight of his bones can’t
be an annoyance to the Thrifty (the thrifty
have no more right to be annoyed by the spec-
tacle of the bones of the thriftless than to be
annoyed by having to pay to keep the latter
class from becoming bones). The other idea is
that the thriftless should be executed when
they get past work, and then boiled down and
the products sold to pay execution expenses
(for the thrifty man to have to contribute out
of his little fund towards the expense of de-
capitating the thriftless would be nothing short
of an outrage). Which of these two courses
has the Christchurch Tory organ the courage to
advocate ?
The Orange-and-Green processions case in Mel-
bourne brought to light a shriekingly humorous
Wesleyan preacher. The reverend was on the
Orange side of the case, and started his evidence
glibly enough :
George Tregear, Wesleyan minister, gave evidence
with regard to the service performed in the Presbyterian
Church, Brunswick, on 18th July. He had seen the
emblems produced in court the previous day, and they
were emblematical of the great civil victories won by the
King—the lawful King.
Then barrister Smyth stopped his streak of
eloquence by asking the name of the king, and
there was a pause which nearly blew the roof
off the premises. The witness had either
forgotten or had never known the name of the
blessed monarch he was gushing over, and had
to be informed that his hero was William 111.
When he was informed, he remembered sud-
denly, but probably if he had been told that his
hero was named Samuel XII. he would have
remembered just the same. Then an Irish person
named Nolan loomed up darkly through the fog
of controversy on the other side of the case. He
objected to the waving of the Orange banner
as a premeditated insult intended to rub in the
recollection of the “ batin’ ” his countrymen
“ ressaved.” Being asked for dates or names or
other particulars about the said “ batin’,” he
couldn’t supply any. So, if these two witnesses
w r ere fair specimens of their respective parties,
neither side really knew what it was proceshing
and waving banners and filling the air with cheers
and road-metal about. They howled because
their fathers howled before them, and their
fathers howled because their grandfathers
howled, and what their grandfathers were
howling about had been quite forgotten.
Ed. Bulletin, — Re the cheap nigger. A mass
meeting of Kanakas at Geraldton (Q.), not long
ago, decided to form a Union, and resolved that
no “ boy ” is to sign under £36 a year. Which
goes to prove that the Kanaka is not the
danger to Australia. His supply is limited,
anyway, and he is rapidly dying out; and,
from an economical view-point, this latest move
ought to about abolish Ids usefulness altogether.
£36 a year is nearly 14s. a week, and as the
farmer can procure any amount of white labor
for 155., and the tucker is the same ; also, as
the white hand has to pay his own hospital exs.
when “that tired feeling” comes on, and re-
ceives no pay during absence from work, and
gets the sack in the slack season, or when it
rains too much, or too little ; also, as the white
hand does about three times the amount of
work his black brother condescends to perform,
and doesn’t run in a mob with cane-knives after
his employer, and for many other weighty
reasons too numerous to mention, he, the white
hand aforesaid, turns out to be the true “cheap
labor,” after all. — Von Kotze.

Horace Tozer, in a blazing oration at Gynvpie,
gibed at the Q.N. Bank Commission —the one
which dug out the awful iniquities of the rotten
and bankrupt institution- —because it was paid
for its services. Even Tozer ought to have
dropped down dead of shame before he fired off
that remark. He is the political partner of
Nelson and Barlow who declared that they
had made an exhaustive examination of the in-
solvent wreck, and solemnly staked their honor
on its soundness. He was, till the other day,
the political partner of MTlwraith, who got
away with such enormous sums of the
Q.N.B. depositors’ money. And he is
the political partner of Nelson who is
reported as having asked why M'llwraith
shouldn’t have taken that historic overdraft, if
he could get one—in other words, why he
shouldn’t have made away with other people’s
money, if he was allowed to do it. A man who
can live in such an atmosphere has no right to
complain of any commission taking payment
openly and honestly for its services. In fact,
he would have no right to complain if the com-
mission had bolted with all that remained of
the bank.
T.D. : “There is no convincing average people
that the great war (when it happens) will be
fought on different lines from those of 100 years
back— Nelson and his half-naked tars are still
quoted to show that Britain rules the waves.
But the present navy is altogether untried.
Not one effective vessel has ever been tested—
except by running her aground—whilst 90 out
of every hundred pasty-faced navy-boys have
never faced fire, and those who have were
engaged in nigger-chasing sorties. As for the
man in command, Tryon was the only senior
Admiral of late years with known stamina, and
Tryon’s dead. Beresford, Rawson and the
other dare-devils are all mere rear-admirals and
captains, whose only show is to play second
fiddle to some epauletted old lady.”
The law seems to delight in making a bigger
ass of itself every day. At Flemington (Melb.)
police court on Feb. 8, Wm. Considine, for
assa,ult, battery, and attempted smash of
his wife, was bound over to keep the
peace for twelve months, in sureties of
£lOO altogether. Then defendant: “I have
no money to enter into a bond.” Bench :
“ Well, you will be imprisoned till you get it;
but not more than 12 months.” (Just as if he
could earn it in gaol.) Defendant: “That
means I shall have to go to gaol for a year.”
Exactly ! He will have to go to gaol for a year
—not for assaulting his wife, but because he
hasn’t got the use of a few pounds. Assault
isn’t half so awful a crime as poverty.

Editor Bulletin, —Re working of Factories
Act, it may be news to you that one of the
biggest manufactories in Sydney works on a
sort of sub-contract system. It’s this way.
The foreman, or boss of each department,
instead of receiving a fixed wage, has the option
of sending in a price for the work, and thus
becomes a middleman, and as he has conse-
quently to cut things as fine as possible the
wages of the men under him (paid by him and
not by the firm) have to suffer accordingly.
One man in this position has averaged from
£2O to £3O per week for years ! yet is too
miserable to keep a temporary hand on five
minutes longer than he can help ! When there
happens to be a rush of work, and a few men
are put on for a couple of hours, if this boss
can save a single quarter of an hour’s work it’s
—“ That’ll do for to-day !” as he puts his hand
in his pocket and chucks the money (about
9d. per hour for heavy toil) on the ground,
like a bone to a dog. After all,
though, the men don’t deserve better treat-
ment —the temporary hands for submitting to
it, and the permanent hands for crawling.
Some of these latter, after working all week
—Saturday afternoons too, and overtime in-
cluded, will go creeping round to the works on
Sunday trying to put in a few hours’ work for
odd jobs, thus doing the poor devils of casual
hands out of a few shillings ! Finally, it is
significant that the department in these works
where the men have the shortest hours and the
highest pay is not worked on this infernal sub-
contract system.— Worker.
The recent stoppage of European cables, through
interruption of telegraph lines between Port
Darwin and Adelaide and also between Mel-
bourne and Sydney, should do much to urge the
construction of a line from Burketown (Q.) to
the station at Port Darwin. The two present
routes are the longest possible, and a message
destined to Sydney or Brisbane has either to
travel right through the continent to Adelaide,
and then along many hundred miles of coast-
line, or else to be transmitted by the still more
tedious alternative line from Roebuck Bay
(W.A.) to Perth, and so to Adelaide. Only the
fact that Port Darwin is in S.A. territory, and
the S.A. Govt, wants the pickings, could ever
block the extension from Burketown, which
would avert most of the inconvenience now
experienced.
The parochial party in N.S.W. politics was
very hard up for an advocate when the splashy
A. G. Taylor was induced to whoop up the
provincial aspect of the case in the columns of
the Star. The following slab shows Taylor
at his best:—
The Federal Constitution is tied to the following absurd
trinity of action Each colony must govern itself; each
colony must, in the Parliament of the Australian Com-
monwealth, govern its neighbors ; and each colony must,
by the same medium, be governed by its neighbors— all at
the same time. Is not the collapse of these conflicting
powers and interests likely to cause such a complicated,
contradictory and quixotic rule as never before prevailed
anywhere? Could it possibly last?
Adolphus G. Taylor evidently thought he had
discovered something quite new when he dug
out this fact, and yet if he had suddenly dis-
covered the existence of the ’bus-horse it would
have been about as wildly novel a find. The
United States is run on exactly that plan ; each
State governs itself (locally), and by its repre-
sentatives in Congress it helps (federally) to
govern the other States and they govern it.
Switzerland, Germany, Mexico, and other
States run on the same basis. So does
N.S.W. ; Sydney, Newcastle, and other places
govern themselves by their municipal councils,
and they also, through the local Parliament,
govern each other and are governed by each other.
The other provinces are in exactly the same
situation, only more so because they have more
complete local government systems. They
have all been in the same situation for many
years. Every country in Europe is in the same
situation, and some of them have been there
for nearly eight centuries. The spectacle of A.
G. Taylor, advancing this find as his own
perfectly new Federal horror, is the worst
example on record of the lean and slippered
ancestor receiving instruction about the egg.
Rev. L. J. Fish, vicar of Bathampton church
(Eng.), where, it has been discovered, con-
vict-Gov. Phillip is buried, rushes open-
mouthed at N.S. W. for a monument to decorate
his sacred institoosh’n. This Fish is evidently
a shark. He writes to a friend in Sydney,
urging him to “ keep the matter alive and afire,
and to redress the very real grievance which
Phillip has against us all ” —when a man’s
buried in your church you can dig his
remains familiarly in the ribs and call
them plain Phillip —“that on his grave
no word appears to remind posterity that
he ever stepped foot in Australia.” The push-
ing shepherd doesn’t say where he interviewed
the gibbet-Gov. to learn his grievance—down
below where the worm dieth not, or up above
where it liveth not, or in the half-way place
where it is a casual kind of worm with no
reliable footing; or whether he resurrected
Phillip’s bones and stood them on end
in the chancel and inquired severely
whether they weren’t disgusted with N.S.W.’s
neglect. Also, the rev. Fish doesn’t explain
how he ascertained that posterity wishes to be
reminded that the hangy vicegerent “ ever
stepped foot in Australia,” or show that
posterity cares one Scriptural rap about the
matter. Under these vague circumstances The
Bulletin surmises that the grievance begins
and ends with the rev. Fish’s yearning to have
the spending of somebody else’s money in
glorifying his sacred institoosh’n, and it de-
mands in a voice of thunder that the rev. Fish
should put his head in his font and ask the
sexton to pour water on it.
Clement Scott’s aspersions on theatrical mora-
lity, followed by the reproving perfeshunal
cry of “ Judas ! ” may be said to “ give away”
that greasy notice-writer in his critic capacity.
Scott writes as one intimately acquainted with
all sorts and conditions of mummers, and they
naturally protest against the bite of the serpent
they have taken to their bosom. “ What
business had Clement Scott, the critic, to
write about the private life of the mummers
he hobnobbed with ? ” asks the perfeshun.
What business had he with ’em at all, outside
of his own professional work ? the public would
like to know. Some years ago the London
Daily News man (Mowbray Morris?) ad-
mitted regretfully that his theatrical friend-
ships disqualified him from really impartial
criticism. The ideal critic, as he said, would
be an experienced playgoer, possessing a good
artistic perception, dramatic instinct, and a
good memory, who could frustrate all the
attempts of actors, actresses and managers to
push their “friendship” upon him. Mummer
friendliness and “respect” for notice-writers
is just the same thing as the fondness of any
young human animal for the uncle who carries
lollies in his pocket.
A gigantic job is evidently being worked some-
where in the decision of the Vic. defence
department to re-arm the local military forces
with the Martini-Eufield rifle. The present
arm is the Martini-Henry, a weapon good
enough in its way, but completely unfit to cope
with the latest implements of warfare. It was
therefore considered about time to substitute
an up-to-date rifle, and after solemn delibera-
tion the authorities had the brazen front to
recommend the almost equally obsolete Martini-
Enfield ! The reasons that apply to the rejec-
tion of the Martini-Henri also apply with
nearly equal force to the Martini-Eufield. The
latter arm is an improvement on the old weapon,
but a very slight improvement, and at the best
it would be just as useless against the long-
range, quick-firing guns with which other nations
are armed as the arquebus or shanghai. The
Canadian people, whom it was attempted to
bunco with the same old weapon, called in a
board of experts, who unanimously declared
against the Martini-Eufield ; and yet the Im-
perialist gang of swashbucklers in Victoria is
heard to-day shouting the praises of the
weapon, and raising objections to the Lee-Met-
ford. As a matter of fact, there is not the
slightest reason why the rejection of the Mar-
tini-Enfield should mean the acceptance of the
Lee-Metford. The Ashton magazine rifle,
locally owned and locally financed, has been
proved, on the word of those same swash-
bucklers, to be superior in every respect—
accuracy, speed, and durability—to either of
the other weapons.

Miss Sutherland, directress of the Vic. Neg-

girls take advantage of the Women’s Hospital
for maternity purposes, and that nine-tenths
of the patients belong to the lowest class of
women. This she ascribes to the “ committee ”
system, which is the rule at the institution
named. Every applicant for admission in her
time of trouble has to come before a committee
of “ society ” women and be subjected to a
series of questions regarding her “fall” and
the details thereof. Only the most innocent
and the most shameless women brave this
ordeal, the majority preferring, when the
gentle abortionist fails, to seek some wretched
suburban hovel, and, with her last few shil-
lings, hire some drunken harridan to “see her
through.”

crowded house. The breeze came in handy, too,
for Saturday night at the Lyceum isn’t an over-
healthy function nowadays. The 2s. d.c. grows
steadily more crowded and less select, and, on
Saturday, it chews peanuts something awful, and
breathes a powerful breath of fish and cheese at
the universe in general. Also, it stands up in its
excitement just when Diver is throwing the
butchered girl into the English Channel, and, on
Saturday, it stood up more than usual, and blotted
out a good deal of “ Nancy ” from the writer’s
view. There is a large wreck in “ Nancy ” : Diver
blows out the beacon on a stormy night so that
the steamer with his boss on board may be lost,
and thus prevent the old man coming ashore to
find out the shortage in the cash. A rather realistic
steamer labors ashore, and Diver, in a moment of
repentance, hauls a lone survivor on the beach.
Then finding it is the boss, he bangs his head
against the rocks and throws him in again, after
taking all his money.
* * • *
Theieafter Diver leads a bloodstained ex-
istence, which is just visible through a driving
mist of pea-nuts. He leads Maud Williamson
astray, which is nothing unusual for that lady,
who must be one vast blue bruise through fainting
in many dramas when the same bad man declines
to make her an honest woman. (He was just
refusing to make her an honest woman on Satur-
day when the writer’s attention was distracted by
a friendly person offering him a pea-nut.) He also
slaughters her beside a rustic bridge, in the pre-
sence of Lilian Wheeler, who is walking in her
sleep, dressed in white, and carrying her bedroom
candle, so that it won’t combust the mosquito-
curtains in her absence. Likewise, he accuses
Miss Wheeler of the murder and has her run in ;
and later he makes good time round the room
after her with a carving-knife, or a pea-nut, or
something; and he ruins everybody, and is an
awful desperado in a soft hat until something
happens that was completely hidden on Saturday
by the sudden standing up of two people, with
their mouths full of pea-nuts, and a girl with a
frayed fowl in her hat. But the man who had
been accommodating a girl on his knee leaned
across the writer to tell a man with a short
jacket, and a soft hat which he kept on
all the time, and a shock head and a
powerful gin fragrance, that “Diver was an
alright bloke.” And the communication which
the man with the girl on his knee made to
the shock-headed man is endorsed by The Bul-
letin. The person addressed took the same view
and said Diver wasn’t too dashed horrid, and
blew a quantity »£ pea-nut shells on to the floor.
* * • *
The general impression left by “Nancy”
is not at all unfavorable, though it is only a
general impression—a lot of the small details
being blotted out by the distracting influence of
pea-nuts. In addition to the raging villain above
mentioned, Johnston Weir, as an eccentric tight
person devoted to agriculture, leaves a good effect
behind him. It is an unusual thing for Johnston
W. to drop into comedy, but he drops with excel-
lent results. Frank Harcourtand Stirling Whyte
are two reliable stand-bys, and are never seri-
ously misplaced. Miss Maud Williamson falls
creditably in the long brown cloak of t’ e Lost
Girl, though too much pea-nut obscures some of
her efforts ; and Miss Lilian Wheeler is a pretty
Nancy who hugs her returned sailor picturesque y
by a pale-green sea on which Brown of Lon on has
just been not at all well in a boat. Possibly it was
the pea-nuts which upset Brown of London.
How Brown came to be on the sea at all the
writer doesn’t know, for he came back from a
brief absence to find his seat jumped by a person
with cheap hair-oil on his head, and while he was
asking for the return of his seat, and being
informed that the oiled person would see him
blazing first, he missed this point. He isn’t even
certain that it was Brown.
*# * *
That old pale-green establishment, Sydney
Opera House, re-opened, according to promise,
under the management of Stanford and Barnes.
The principal result, so far, is that the ill-luck of
the old York-street curse still keeps up its end of
the log vigorously. On an average night the new
venture is sickbed o’er with the pale cast of
.£3 7s. 6d., or something that looks like that, and
if things got very much worse, and the manage-
ment went out to see a dog after the show, and it
was a good-sized dog, it would about absorb the
takings. Yet, considered in the light of prices
that range from Is. fid. down to 6d., the present
version of “ Shamus O’Brien” is a deserving
show. It would probably be rushed, at these
strictly moderate prices, if it were not that the
public is just about as likely to rush the Opera
House nowadays as old Sunday Brunker is to go
on the burst at Chowder. The public has abso-
lutely forgotten the establishment. Yet the
Opera House has at least the merit of being one
of the few remaining Sydney theatres whose cur-
tain doesn’t call on the public to drink somebody’s
bile corn-plaster at fid. each when it has that tired
feeling, or to hit the kitchen cockroach with
Brown’s patent club and beware of cheap imita-
tions which haven’t the name on the bottle.
• • • •
“ Shamus O’Brien ” is a reasonably good
thing in the way of Irish drama, and the Stanford-
Barnes co. has some good points. There is a
certain tail to it, but here and there a refreshing
pinnacle of merit rises above the dead waste of
eighteen pence. C. R. Stanford is a tall, imposing
rebel who now and then does a patch of really
good work. Phil Walsh’s informer is red and
crawlsome and impressive and beastly ungrateful.
Also Kate O’Reilly, represented by Miss Alice
Senior, stands out conspicuously as a bright and
clever atom of Irish humanity. Miss Senior
doesn’t need to be judged by the eighteenpenny
standard ; her performance would be good even
if she were in much better company. Miss
Theresa Lindahl, the tall and statuesque heroine,
leaves a respectable impression, but, on the whole,
The Bulletin considers it better to hold her over
for further consideration. And, unless the
management can lift the curse off the ancient
green theatre by prayer and incantation, it looks
as if there would be very little time for further
consideration. The writer has a vague recollec-
tion that a black cat boiled without vegetables on
a moonless night over the grave of an unbaptised
infant has been held to be good in such cases.

Wilson Barrett makes his first appearance
before a Sydney audience on Saturday week (sth
March) in the “Manxman.” This is a kind of
disappointment to Sydney, which has been yearn-
ing for more stately Roman legs ever since Marcus
Superbus trailed his biled toga over Her Majesty’s
stage, and there was a general hope that the new
hero would open in “Claudian.” It is generally
understood that there are many Roman legs in
“Claudian.” However, the public will wait with
what patience it can raise for the appearance of
that ancient person of wealth and bad character.
In the meantime, the “ French Maid is pursuing
her butterfly way as usual, and her gauzy wings
look very pretty in the gaslight and the glare of
the johnny’s opera-glass.
* * * *
The second Albani concert is fixed for
Saturday, at Sydney Town Hall, and the third
and last of the season is due for next Tuesday.
* * # *
Rickards’s valuable entertainment at Syd-
ney Tivoli is much the same as last week. The
astonishing Hegelmanns do the same astonishing
things as before, and, when these grow stale, the
three break out in a fresh place. And the fresh
place which they break out at is just as surprising
as the place where they made the previous break-
age.
* * * *
The silver coin enterprise at Sydney Royal
Standard has been taking a turn at that venerable
whisky drama, “Ten Nights in a Bar Room.” It
is a long time since this moral snake-horror was
seen in Sydney, and it is also a lontr time since
Sydney had enough loose cash to spend one really
wet night in a bar-room—let alone ten. The
management which would put up “Ten Nights in
a Bar Room ” in these times is lost to all sense of
the fitness of things.
* * * *
Melbourne theatres are having an unex-
pected boom-time just now, owing to the simul-
taneous re-appearance of two old, reliable melo-
dramas—“ Silver King ” and “ The Sliaughraun.”
Thousands of people who seldom go to a theatre
are attracted by this combination of familiar
names, reckoning that if they can’t find room at
one house they can fall back on the other. The
situation is favorable to the prospects of the Cart-
wright co. at the Bijou. The large proportion of
public that seldom reads theatrical advts. is just
now devouring them eagerly, and a desire for
unwonted dissipation is in the air of the church-
going world, so to speak. The rush for “Silver
King ” is easily explained. The name-part is
everywhere associated with the managing actor
who first put it on the stage. He has had years of
preliminary advt. saving up for him in Australia
where references to his identity with the character
are always getting into print. Even the police-
court reports have helped to call attention to the
matter. A prisoner or witness with long, white
hair will be likened to Wilson Barrett in the
“ Silver King.” It is a solid celebrity.
* * * *
“The Squire of Daines,” which opened
the new season at Melbourne Bijou on Saturday
night, is a conversational comedy adapted from
the French by R. O. Carton, the author of
“ Liberty Hall.” It is a pale, dainty-looking narra-
tive of how a grass-widow was more than half
inclined to go astray with the inevitable baronet
until she found salvation in the friendship of the
name-character. The Squire aforesaid is a leisured
bachelor, who combines the social harmlessness
of a tame admirer with a valuable insight
into other people’s amours and a particu-
lar talent for restoring dames to their lost hus-
bands ere anything shocking has occurred. He
represents the Parisian idea of all that is noblest
in human nature. Oscar Wilde, in a virtuous
mood, might have written such a play as this, and
would probably have made it rather more interest-
ing. “The Squire of Dames ” is bright and
clever, and will get a good word from the more
advanced “B. and B.” section of the public, but
the germ of a great Australian popularity is not
in it.
* * * a
First impressions were of first importance
to the ne,w Bijou enterprise, and the management
had bad luck in getting an unduly sotto-voce per-
formance on Saturday. Only three members of
the company—Charles Cartwright, Miss Darragh,
and Hans Phillips—were sufficiently loud to be
always audible. The others (strangers, all of
them) seemed to have found a bad spot in the
pitch of the theatre, and their voices broke to leg,
or somewhere, instead of coining straight at the
audience. This was only a first-night defect, of
course, but it was likely to prejudice the second
night’s attendance. Charles Cartwright’s voice
is the same ringing organ of sound that it
used to be, yet mellower and more flexible.
Also his manner is more suave and pleasing, and
the dramatic force that marked him in “The
Middleman ” of yore l is doubtless ready to come
with a rush when called for. There is no call for
Cartwrightian emotion in “The Squire of Dames.”
The strong actor merely plays the central part in
an easy, graceful manner for all it is worth. Miss
Beatrice Lamb, as the wife who listens to good
advice, promised to let herself go, in a dramatic
sense, several times during Saturday evening,
but inasmuch as the leading lady didn’t loose her
hold upon herself, The Bulletin will wait for an
opportunity to say how far she can go when she
gets the better of her self-restraint. At a first
glance, Miss Lamb appears to be an impertur-
bable actress—a very quiet reminder of the
unfortunate Amy Roselle. Miss Gethyn Darragh
plays a Yankee heiress with great feeling and a
refreshingly correct accent; likewise, successful
first appearances are scored by Messrs. Arthur
Styan and Hartley Manners. The baffled baronet
is treated in a strangely unsatisfactory style by
Chas. Thursby, who may, however, cut an effec-
tive figure presently in a less awkward part. Miss
Katherine Stewart and the non-imported Hans
Phillips fill a pair of irrelevant characters, and
little Miss Noni Rickards appears as their
daughter. Miss Noni, being at present a very
young amateur, is much too young even for the
small part of a damsel who loves a lordling’s beard.
“The Squire of Dames” will be matineed on
Saturday.
** * *
“ The Silver King ” proved a mighty boom
at Melb. Princess’s last week, wherefore the
management withdrew its announcement of “ Six
Nights Only” and finally decided to run the
original Denver for a fortnight. The original
Denver, as The Bulletin remarked last week,
was bound to boom, and the management’s failure
to understand the business possibilities of “Wilson
Barrett as the Silver King ” seems extraordinary to
this journal, notwithstanding that this journal has
recorded the unwisdom of showmen in general for
many years past. “ Silver King ” might as well
run to the end of the season, which happens next
Wednesday, but the programme for the last nights
is “ Hamlet ” (Saturday and Monday), “ Othello ’’
(Tuesday), and one more consecutive production
of “ Virginius ’’ for the co.’s last appearance. That
long-winded Roman father is seemingly Wilson
Barrett’s favorite character.
** * *
“ The Sliaughraun ” is putting in a festive
two weeks at the Royal, thanks to the genial
humor of Grattan Riggs and the all-round quality
of a popular-priced show, and the overflow from
the Princess’s, likewise the change in the weather.
Twelve nights of Boucicault’s old drama will not
exhaust its financial strength, judging from recent
indications, but, all the same, “ The Irish Detec-
tive ” is said to be coming on Saturday. A few
years have joined the majority since Grattan
Riggs’s last outbreak in his old round of detective
characters at Melbourne, and this revival may
consider itself called for.
** * *
There is nothing in particular to say of
“ Jack the Giant Killer,” at the Opera House,
except that the usual eight performances are being
crowded into each returning week, and that Will
Whitburn will join the company on Saturday
next. “Jack” is doing well, for reasons pre-
viously stated and generally understood.
** * *
The Alexandra’s five-act shocker for the
present week is “ Under the Gaslight,” and Dan.
Barry’s unrivalled stage locomotive is providing
some more entertainment for the masses. Another
drama of domestio interest will unfold its gory
length as soon as possible. The first series of
Continental Concerts in the Exhibition quad-
rangle is to close on Saturday, but if Melb. gives
evidence of a growing demand for ballad singing
in the balmy air a second series will follow.
** * *
Next Friday afternoon (25th) the theatrical
forces of Melbourne give a large combination show
for the benefit of the Distressed Actors’ Fund,
which deserving institution, in the natural course
of things, gets compelled to cry aloud for Cash at
regular intervals. Five theatres will contribute
the best of their “talent” to the mixed bill, and
the public is cordially exhorted to book seats right
away.
** * *
At Hobart Royal “ The Two Little Vaga-
bonds ” drew a racing carnival audience for several
nights and paid a fair dividend to the Firm. As
“ boys ” the Misses Titheradge and Terriss were
somewhat unconvincing, Sweeney and Oily Deer-
ing made very fair specimens of villains, while
Julia Merton, in Biddy Mullins’ drunken croon of
“ Mavourneen,” fetched the gods with an amazing
fetch. As Marion Thornton, Miss Emilie Hughes
got along sympathetically, despite her inability to
call her purse anything but a “ pus ”; curse,
“cuss”; and worse, “ wuss.” Regardless of many
Warnings, Frank Thornton opened on Thursday
at the Royal with Miss Brown, and threatens to
perpetrate one or other of his queeriosities while
he can get a bun and a glass of milk.
AT POVERTY POINT.
O.P. : “ He Australians’ attitude to stars and celebrities.
I think the nil admirari pose is a reaction from too much
admiring. The Australian is impulsive, and almost in-
variably expects the impossible. When he gets only the
possible—no matter how good it is—he grumbles, and
stays that way. But he doesn’t begin by grumbling : his
initial enthusiasm is tremendous.”
Pro. : “ Be that photo, of the beauteous Miss Ethel
Havdon. To judge from the results of ‘ the apparatus
which can’t lie,’ Ethel pads ! Those ‘knobby’ legs pro-
claim the fact. She isn’t well-padded, either ; amateur-
like, she doesn’t know how to put the ‘ fat ’ on.”
Somebody sends Tub Bulletin this paragraphic state-
ment : “ Actor Wilson Barrett will be 41 years of age
during next May.” We print it in all seriousness, and
would like to know whether it came from Vincent
Crummies, the theatrical gentleman in “ Nicholas
Niekleby ” who never could understand how such thim>s
get into the papers. Actor Wilson Barrett will be 41
years of age during next May. Likewise during March
and April, no doubt.
The story of the first meeting of Albani with the Gye
family (Ernest Gye is now her husband, and is with her
on her Australian tour) is very curious. Col. Mapleson
(who tells the yarn) had engaged Albani when a very
young singer to warble for his Italian opera season in
London. When she first arrived there she directed a
cabman to drive her to the Italian Opera. The man drove
her to the Itoyal Italian Opera. She went to the
manager’s room, said her name was Albani, and that she
had come to sign the contract. The manager said “ Very
handed her a printed contract form to sign.
When she had put her name to it he told her that he
wasnt Mapleson but Gye. There was, he said, “a
manager named Mapleson who ran a theatre somewhere
round the corner, where operas and other things were
from time to time performed, but the opera, the perma-
nent institution known as such, was the one he had the
honor of conducting.” He told her that, if she liked, he
would tear up the contract she had just signed, and leave
her free to go to Mapleson, but he was willing to offer her
her own terms. As it happened, Mapleson was willing to
release her, so she stayed with Gye, and subsequently
became Mrs. Ernest Gye.
S.S. : “ Old friend Grattan Riggs—what a treat he is in
a back parlor ! —is rather too bulky and too far on the
other side of the hill to act the part of Conn; but, apart
from a slight throat trouble, how beautifully he talked
Boucicault’s fine stuff, the other night. I have seen many
pretty Conns, this is the only Irish one—Irish all through,
in his impertinence, and his deference with the devil in
it. Conn set me thinking of Mulvaney. It seems to me
that a modicum of Kipling’s advertised marvellous
divination may have come from Boueicault. But Mul-
vaney would be a treat in the hands of a good comedian
—who would not be glad to see and hear any such tell
the story of ‘The Big Drunk Draf,’ or ‘My Lord the
Elephant,’ as a ‘ turn ’ at a benefit ? ”
While Wilson Barrett revives the “ Silver King,” in
Melb., Arthur Garner, the old original and unsurpassed
“ Spider,” is running the only show on Klondyke—“ Ten
Nights in a Bar-Room ” alternately with “ East Lynne.”
E.D. : “Surely record business was done at Melb.
Princess’s during the early part of last week? Walking
up Bourke-street, at about a quarter to 8, on Wednesday
evening, I encountered a stream of battle-stained, more-
or-less bedraggled and vehement people, all furious at
haying failed to beat their way into the theatre after
being gouged, and crushed, and scrambled over by the
madding crowd, and all seeming to cherish a bitter
grievance against the management because the theatre
was not 15 sizes bigger. The charge up the back stairs
for 2s. seats has never been equalled since Waterloo, the
fights for wicket in Bernhardt’s time being comparatively
mild and bloodless. Nicely-dressed women come through,
tremulous wrecks, bleeding faces being almost as frequent
as battered hats up aloft. Every available gallery-seat
was taken up at 100 per cent, advance, and, down below,
hundreds had to be emptied out of the stalls, some being
accommodated with standing-room in the circle, and
others turned empty away. This is a mild statement of
facts ; as for the why and wherefore, I can only say that
sometimes the public is more like a mob of sheep than
others, and this is one of the times.”
Haresfoot : “Barrett’s Pete in ‘The Manxman’ is the
ne plus ultra of the domestic. Such a kind of thing was
lifted out of the clamps of the Real into the limitless
Ideal by Jefferson’s Rip, and Emmet’s Fritz. I happened
to be much about the theatre during an Emmet season.
Look at his performance any time and it w'ould clutch
you, but you only fail to see Barrett’s wires the first
time.”
In the new Sydney Lyceum drama of “Nancy” there
was a subdued laugh all round, the first night, when
Lilian Wheeler found Maud Williamson murdered, and
cried out “Too late!” It set everybody thinking of
Burke’s wail of “Two shillings” in the recent Majesty’s
panto.
There is a scrupulous etiquette in the musical profes-
sion. Some years ago both Albani and Patti were in New
York. One morning, Albani and husband Gye were
standing at their hotel-window, when they saw Patti and
husband Nicolmi drive by. “ Ernest,”said Albani, “they
are gone out; we must go and call at once.” In the
evening Patti said to her husband : “ Ernest ” (he was an
Ernest also), “ they’re gone to the theatre by now ; let us
go and leave cards at the hotel.”
“ A Regular Attendant” writes to the Argus :—“ I do
not see ‘The Sign of the Cross’ mentioned as one of
Wilson Barrett’s last performances in Melbourne, and I
would like to know whether we are to have the pleasure
of seeing Mr. Barrett in this special play, as I do not
think I am far out in saying hundreds of people besides
myself are living in anticipation of doing so. Trusting
we will not be disappointed.” How like a Regular At-
tendant !
Melba threatens to visit Australia “in July or August.”
Australian girls will probably divide their kind regards
between Albani and the tall, handsome new-comer,
William Pauli, baritone.
“ We have travelled several thousands of miles to sing
to about half the prices readily obtained in London,” re-
marked Ernest Gye, husband of Albani, on hearing that
7s. fid. was to be the highest charge for admission,
Rickards tried on the early-door dodge at Melb. Bijou,
but it didn’t come off. The ticket-seller soon had his cage
surrounded by a chaffing crowd who calmly war ed off
any promising sixpences. This went on tili 7.45, when
the man retired from the struggle and a free fight for
shilling tickets began. “Ladies first, please.” “No,
ladies be damned !”
L.P.W. :—“One of the musical critic’s choicest privi-
leges is to be able to slate artists who give the public
what they like instead of what they ought (according to
the critic) to like. Melbourne Argus musical man, for
instance, holds in lofty scorn the performance on the
Town Hall organ of popular operatic and other selections.
Nothing but Bach fugues and Mendelssohn sonatas for
this painfully superiah person. Poor David Lee was
railed at foryears, and then altogether ignored, because he
persisted in giving his audiences the music they liked.
Recently, Charles Sykes, organist of St. Pat’s Cathedral,
got badly slated for playing music which delighted one of
the largest audiences that has attended the Town Hall
recitals for many a year past. Charles scored heavily,
though, with a similar programme the following week,
drawing an even bigger ‘ house' and receiving tumult-
ous applause. Let the Argus rave as it will, the musically
unregenerate will persist in being delighted with the
strains of ‘Faust’ and ‘Lucia,’ of ’Pinafore’ and ‘Madame
Angot.’ It’s a weary world for the critic who sets out to
‘ educate the people.’ ”
“ About the 20th (Jan.) * Dot ’ Boueicault will re-open
the Court Theatre,” writes Tub Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent, “ with a new farcical comedietta, ‘Trelawney
of the Wells,’ by Pinero, and success is more than
probable. Hilda Spong and Pattie Browne are both
in the cast. Dot plays an old earl, and Irene Van-
brugh is heroine. Not the least important mum-
mer is * our earl ’ — Lord Rossl.vn, fifth holder of
that century-old peerage. On the bills, he is merely
‘ James Erskine ’—his first two names—and to the co. he
is simply ‘Jimmy.’ He married one of R. C. Vyner’s
daughters, and spent the wholesale coal-miner’s money
and his own with the ‘quick and the dead’—the latter
mostly. The ‘ uncrowned ’ Prince has fed at his table,
and he has had some good ‘gee-gees’ in his stables
Minting, the famous flatracer, and winner of the Grand
Prix, was his father-in-law’s; and Buccaneer Jimm\
bought as a selling-plater. On him, he won £22,000 in
bets in his first race, the Gt. Ebor Handicap, and then
took the Ascot Cup and City and Suburban. But the
‘ books ’ got it all, for he was a reckless plunger, and now
he is an actor for a wage on which he has to keep his
wife, to whom he is much attached.”
Paradis : “ An eminently natural inevitable finale to a
stage combat is for the hero and villain to beirin rolling
over and over, at the back scene, and stop at the foot,
lights. It was an eye-opener for me to see Stoneham, as
the villain, and Miss Aslin, as a drummer-boy, do this,
in the ‘ Parson’s Oath,’ Melb. Alexandra. Rather too

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
A big Sydney bubble burst last week. On Feb.
® on the information of one of Australia’s most capable
patent-agents—Bulletin pointed out that investors might
‘ So slow ” re an alleged invention for making inflam-
mable gas out of ordinary air, which didn’t look too well
guaranteed. Since then the two “ inventors ” have fled
with detectives after them, and with, apparently, about
£oooo of dupes’ cash in their pockets. The third applicant
for patent was, it seems, honestly diddled like the rest.
The modus was absurdly simple. Something in
the guise of a machine was produced, into which a certain
amount of sulphuric ether was poured, and while promin-
ent citizens gaped O! O! O! a gas-stove and an engine
and other trifles were apparently run with a minimum of
expense and bother. Then the prominent citizens rushed
to purchase shares—and to tell the good thing to their
friends—with astonishing results. The co. was to be
floated in 1600 £lO-shares —1200 of which the “inventors”
took fully paid-up, though 400 were to remain in trust for
the time being. Four hundred shares were offered to the
public—and of the proceeds the “inventors” were to
mu 6 ****' *lOOO going- for patent and flotation expenses.
The public simply tumbled, over one another in eager-
ness to buy. The shares were all taken up instanter, and
began changing hands at £3O, £6O, even up to 190, and
still there were not half enough shares for all the people
who vyanted to get in on the ground-floor of “ the greatest
llluminant of the century.” And all the time two of the
“ inventors” had a neat little pipeattached to the machine,
through which gas or gasolene was conveyed wholesale
from next-door, wherewith to work the marvels.
Only one cute individual seems, being a
chemist, to have smelt a rat. One of the ingredients of
the marvellous generating-compound was citronella-oil—
something with a strong smell—and the chemist imme-
diately drew the conclusion that the smell was intended
to cover up the stink of the gas or the kerosene, on which
tne inventors really relied. This, considering- the boom, and
the fever, and the names which backed the “ invention,”
argues considerable acumen on the chemist’s part. Any-
way, there has been more swearing in Sydney speculative
circles last week than an ordinary, average-sized gehenna
would hear in a month. The two “ inventors ” (Lee and
Elliott) fled to Wellington, M.L., and took ship on s.s.
Aorangi, bound for’Fr's io via Honolulu, where an attempt
to intercept them will be made. Lee is a Yank—full name
George Washington Lee—and the omen duly came off 1
•lake Garrard, N.S.W.’s Minister for Edu-
cation, himself a mechanic with a Mort’s Dock train-
ing, was one of the victims ; and the account of his flab-
bergastment when the cat came out is rich indeed.
Apparently Minister Garrard, after the flight of the in-
ventors, had been experimenting with the invention, and
there was an explosion in the room in Vickery’s Chambers
where the Light of the Age hung out. Proprietor
Vickery went to investigate, and saw “ a man with his
coat off, his shirt sleeves turned up, standing in an ab-
stracted fashion near a generator. There was, Mr.
Vickery believes, another man in the other room. But
Mr. Vickery’s attention was caught by the attitude of the
first experimentor. He was in the position of a man who
looks but sees not, and who is having his mind led by
easy gradations to the comprehension of a profound idea,
or is but half-conscious of occupying a ridiculous situa-
tion. ‘ What do you mean, sir ?’ demanded Mr. Vickery,
fresh with the idea that the whole of his beautiful block
of buildings might have been sacrificed by the uncertain
researches of an amateur experimentor with gases, ‘by
using my rooms to experiment in? Out of the place at
once, sir. Pack up ybur things, and put them in the
street.’ The unknown, to Mr. Vickery, experimentor was
by this time coming to, and the interview was somewhat
abruptly ended by a member of the fire brigade, who had
stepped in, asking Mr. Garrard if he was hurt. “MR.
GARRARD t !!” said Mr. Vickery, “why, I didn’t know
you!”
Marvel is that when they found Sydney’s
biggest heads so eager to be taken in, the amateur John
Laws didn’t make their bubble ten times as big. Majah
Neild, who was induced to act—quite honestly and
uncomprehendingly, of course—as decoy-duck, and re-
ceived £3OO for his services, has actually a current suit in
equity claiming 60 shares in the invention—which were
promised to him, but never handed over, because, it was
said, he didn’t have to do any work to get the money ; it
simply rolled in on top of him !
By the way, it is said that Minister Garrard and
Col. P. B. Walker, Superintendent of N.S.W. Telegraphs,
who acted as trustees between shareholders and “ in-
ventors,” handed over the latter’s whack when patent was
applied for—instead of, according to instructions, when
patent was granted — so there may be more trouble in
store.

Last year’s trade returns showed a large in-
crease in N.S.W. commerce, and how much good that
increase did to the province may be gathered from these
figures:—
Imports. ’ Exports. E E “ ts ° f
1891 .. £25,383,397 £25,944,020 £560,623
1892 .. 20,776,526 21,972,247 1,195,721
1893 .. 18,107,035 22,921,223 4,814,188

1897 „ 21,744,350 23,602,991 1,858,641
N.S.W. has to -export about £4,000,000 a year more
than it imports so as to pay interest on its * foreign
debt. If it doesn’t do this it is getting further
in debt and growing more and more bankrupt.
It can only do it by increasing its exports, which
seems impossible at present, or by doing with less
imports. In the brief Protectionist period it did with
less imports and paid its way. The “great expansion of
trade” which attended the glorious Reid policy was
mainly an expansion of imports—not of exports. In other
words, the expansion consisted in the country starting to
buy a lot more than it could pay for, and the recent
resumption of the old device of floating loans in London
was the natural result. The free and generous process of
buying more than the country could pay for was reducing
the local gold-supply so near panic point that something
had to be borrowed in London to keep the game afloat.

An insolvency case, heard the other day at Mel-
bourne, goes to show that the nevv Vic. law, if it is
decently enforced, has its advantages. The pity is that
the first man it fell upon was a small German owing £l5O.
The German applied for his discharge on the ground that
three-fourths of his creditors had agreed to accept 6d. in
the £. Judge Molesworth replied that under the old Act
anything which three-fourths of the creditors accepted
was binding on the rest—therefore, an insolvent could,
if he chose, give back-dated p.n’s to all his reliable
friends, and thus constitute them creditors, and they
could accept anything in the £, and compel the
real creditors to do likewise. The new Act, however,
gave the Court power to refuse its sanction to any
arrangement which seemed inequitable, and the Judge
therefore fired the small German out of court. Two
weeks later, the insolvent suddenly found that he could
pay 7s. in the £, and Molesworth put him through on
that basis. But, alas ! almost all the million-pound lions
of the boom have got their discharges under the old, easy
system, and the new law only chews up the mice that are
left.

The Western Australian Bank closed its half-
year at 31st Dec., 1897, with a very handsome profit of
£18,251. This equals 36J per cent, per annum on capital,
yet, all the same, it looks as if the great and sudden boom
of the Westralian Bank was on the turn. The following
are the profits for eight half-years:—
June, ’94 .. £8,387 June, ’96 .. £12,284
December, ’94 .. 9,623 December, ’96 .. 16,703
June,’9s .. 10,315 June,’97 .. 19,685
December, ’95 .. 10,972 December, ’97 .. 18,251
The present is, therefore, the first half-year since the great
boom set in when the profits have shown a decline. Still,
the Westralian Bank has done well, on paper anyhow,
out of the boom. It still keeps its dividend at 17J per
cent. (£8750 for the half-year), which is large enough cer-
tainly, though nothing compared to what it might have
been of late, and has raised its reserve in three years from
£lOO,OOO to £175,000. It has also £7861 left at profit, so
there is an accumulation of nearly £183,000, and a capital
of £lOO,OOO at the back of the little institution. It took
the Westralian Bank 51 years to accumulate the first
£BO,OOO of that reserve, and the other £95,000 was piled
up in 5| years—so things have gone Well with it in recent
times.
Other signs of the fading boom are: The note-
circulation has decreased £7OOO in the last half-year.
Deposits have decreased nearly £200,000 in the half-year,
and £275,000 in the year. Advances are £20,000 less than
they were six months ago, and cash (£614,000) has
diminished £170,000. Still the cash is equal to 35
per cent, of all liabilities to the public, which is a very big
reserve. The Westralian Bank never publishes an audi-
tors’ certificate—so far as this paper knows the accounts
have never been audited in the orthodox fashion in all its
56 years’ existence. This doesn’t really matter much,
considering that every auditor The Bulletin knows of has
always alleged that the accounts, however awful, were
quite right “according to the books.” Still, when one
considers how horribly a bank can go wrong when it is
audited, there is a certain interest in speculating how
much worse it may, or may not, go wrong when it isn’t.

An arrangement is now under way by which
the Queensland Mutual Insurance co. sells out its business
to the Manchester co.—which will make the third Aus-
tralian fire office absorbed by a British co. within the last
two months. In 1889 there were 33 Australasian fire
offices in existence, and the number is now down to 16.
Unless an absentee-tax strikes the foreign fire-insurance
concern heavily on the jaw, the absorbing process will
apparently go on till this once-flourishing Australian in-
dustry is extinct. And the foreign fire-insurance co.—
which doesn’t necessarily bring any money worth speaking
of to this country, or bring anything, in fact, except its
name and its credit, and which, if it has ordinary luck,
merely opens an office, and humps away the profits—is a
really-deserving subject for taxation. The Queensland
Mutual was a promising little concern, nine years old.
It paid 8 per cent, dividends very steadily, and had
£15,500 paid-up capital and nearly £lO,OOO reserves. Ap-
parently, however, the loss of £3OOO or so in the Melbourne
fire scared this small affair out of its boots, and induced it
to sell out just when it was beginning to attain a respect-
able size and a good position.
Somebody makes a big rise out of the business,
anyhow. The shares (ss. paid) were lately down to about
3s. 6d. Certain persons in the know have been buying
them up lavishly at or about this figure—and, as the Man-
chester co. (so the report goes, anyhow) is to pay 10s. a
share, these knowing people should make a good profit.
Apparently, the chief thing that the miserable ordinary
shareholder pays a director for is not to tell him, till after
he has parted with his shares, that there is any special
reason why he should keep them.
* ♦ * *
The statement that M.L. Government will in-
troduce, next session, a Bill providing for the compulsory
State audit of banks, insurance offices, &c., naturally
raises the question—will the Bill also provide for the com-
pulsory shutting-up of institutions which the State audit
proves to be unsound ? Seddon’s provinoe possesses, in the
Provident and Industrial Insurance co., the most curious
insurance concern in the Seven Provinces. This affair
makes its accounts square by including among its assets
£3562 of money spen t in .expenses, said money being put
in among the assets as a sort of suspense account to be
wiped-off by instalments. Its balance-sheet, when boiled
down (The Bulletin published it in a boiled-down state
in its issue of 18th December, 1897), shows that the reserve-
fund and the life-assurance fund have no real existence at
all, and £1239 of the miserable little £4875 capital is
apparently lost as well. In other words, it seems that all
the premiums have gone in losses and expenses, and a
good deal more besides. This paper, therefore, desires to
ask if the proposed State-audit system will be so con-
structed as to promptly round up concerns like the P. and
I. Considering that the Provident and Industrial does
business both in Sydney and Melbourne, the Vic. and
N.S.W. Governments might seriously consider whether
they don’t also need a State-audit system very badly.
• * * *
The N.Z. Accident Insurance Co., one of the
most consistently successful businesses in the Seven Pro-
vinces, shows a profit for 1897 of £6187, and £1894
brought forward from last half-year makes £Bl7l.
An office run on the lines of the Victoria Insur-
ance Co. of Melbourne might have considered this a
favorable opportunity to pay away £6OOO in a 30 per cent,
dividend, but the N.Z. Accident, being conducted on
different principles, pays 10 per cent. (£2000). It also
adds £6OOO to its reserves. The co. has now a paid-up
capital of £20,000, but the accumulated funds of the
fidelity, plate-glass and burglary insurance business —
which have not hitherto been taken' into the profit
account —have increased so largely that £5OOO is to be
transferred to capital, making it £25,000. It has also
£14,000 reserve-fund, and £lO,OOO reinsurance - fund.
The great bulk of the funds are invested in State
and municipal securities which are not liable to the
awful slumps that characterise the delusive mortgage
business, and the income from investments alone (£1839)
is sufficient to pay 9 per cent, on the present capital.
Altogether, the N.Z. Accident looks like the most fortu-
nate insurance concern in Australasia.

Bung-bank ex-directors are invited to observe
that the lately-deceased Orlando Fenwick, formerly a
director of the Metropolitan Bank, instructed his trustees
to pay to his two nieces £lOO, being the amount which he
had induced them to commit to the keeping of the
rickety institution, and which sum he felt “ in honor
bound to refund.” They were his nieces, it is true ; also,
it was only £lOO, it is further true. Moreover, if they
hadn’t got the money this way they would have got most
of it in another, as they were among the principal bene-
ficiaries. In the circumstances it seems pretty clear that
Mr. Fenwick wanted to make a post-mortem suggestion
to other men who were in the same delirious old swim a
few years back. And, so far as it goes, the suggestion is
good enough ; but it is a chastening reflection that not
every victim of the confidence-trick of those days had an
uncle on the board.

Dear Bulletin, —Who is your correspondent,
“Sulphur”? Is he a practical smelter, or a “ pamphlet
metallurgist ” ? He refers to the Lake George mines ex-
traction being I*7B per cent., but does not say on what.
The public will generally understand that I'7B per cent,
on assay value is meant, when the figures actually mean
I*7B per cent, on tonnage of ore smelted, and not on
assay-value. Perhaps the superior knowledge and ex-
perience of “Sulphur” will enable him to suggest a
better method of treatment. — Shareholder.

The White Cliffs Opal Mines, Ltd., was a very
quiet London float of ’96 —so quiet that until J. Bull had
actually been hooked very few on this side knew that the
deal was to be attempted at that time. When they did
know of it they waited in the full expectation (now just
realised) of hearing Bull roar. Opal-mining, as The Bul-
letin has said more than once, is more precarious even
than alluvial gold-getting ; for when you have got your
opal you have next to find your buyer. In its first year’s
operations the co. has found all this out; and it seems to
have come as a revelation. In fact, it isn’t quite realised
yet. Instead of the £30,000 a year profit alleged to have
been promised, the co.’s net loss is £1325, though the
office and incidental expenses, which have been prepos-
terous, partly account for that. As usual, instead of con-
fessing that it has been a great ass, the co. is inclined to
complain that its employes and tributors are great knaves,
who rob it of the best gems. The chairman of the co.
put it to the shareholders —“ There is no doubt a
leakage of fine opal exists and will exist until per-
mission is obtained to amalgamate the various leases,
so that labor can be concentrated and efficiently
supervised.” While local inquiries fail to sup-
port the charge that gem-stealing is common,
it nevertheless is perfectly true that supervision is difficult
at present. But there is the further point to consider
whether concentrated labor is suitable for opal-getting
any more than for kauri-gum digging. And, if it isn’t,
then it’s a question whether opal-getting is a suitable in-
dustry for a big co. to take in hand at all.
The London chairman of the White Cliffs Opal
Mines, Ltd., seems to have suggested to the shareholders
that the opal-buyers at White Cliffs are, for the greater
part, illicit dealers in gems stolen by workmen from the
co. “ They would not,” he added, “ suffer the inconveni-
ence of living in such a place unless they were making
large sums of money by buying opals there and sending
them to Europe, or elsewhere, for sale.” True. But the
co. doesn’t own all White Cliffs, or even a fourth of it.
The men who suffer are the miners working on their own
claims—men who, not being on a co.’s pay-sheet, have to
sell the gem almost as soon as they have raised it, and for
whatever a very select coterie chooses to pay for it.
Before the co. was formed, there was hope of the claim-
holders co-operating and sending the gems to Europe for
direct sale ; but the formation of the co. knocked the pro-
posal out, and ever since then the opal market has been
the despair of every digger—or fossicker ; for, generally
speaking, he is little more than that.

Copper-mining in South Australia : —Wallaroo

over a million tons of ore ; copper to the value of
£9,218,482, and dividends £1,750,000. The old Burra
mine, from less than 250,000 tons of ore, produced over
£3,000,000 in copper, and paid over a million in divs.

Napier Bell has reported re the Macquarie
Harbour (Tas.) bar scheme. His estimate of the cost is.
£219,000, and he reckons it will take nearly five years to
complete the works. His figures are slightly over those
of the local ditto (£50,000), and it is pretty safe to bet
that it will be much more than five years before the bar
is shifted. It is merely a local want, as in the near future
a line will carry all the stuff they can produce on the west
coast to deep water at Emu Bay. However, if the Hobart
crowd don’t get their Great Western Railway, they must
have another costly toy—deep water at Hell’s Gates.
Twelve miles of Emu Bay railway is now ready
for the rails ; and the biggest bridge, over the Mackintosh,
is to be commenced immediately. They seem to get up a
little earlier than the Slowbartians down there. Mean-
while the Western is not yet floated, and is spoken of.

At a certain W. A. gold-mining co.’s directors’
meeting at Coolgardie, in June, ’96 —present (say) Wilkins,
chairman ; Brown, Jones and Smith, directors; and
Robinson, secretary—it was proposed by Smith and
seconded by Jones that Brown should be allotted 1000
contributing shares at ss. as originally applied for.
Carried. Then proposed by Smith and seconded by
Brown that the directors and secretary should have the
privilege of taking up contributing shares, not exceeding
1000 each, to be paid for at the rate of ss. per share within
14 days from the sth June, ’96, or allotment cancelled.
These shares were taken up at dates from 4th to 10th
June, and the scrip, when issued, was antedated to
April 10, though previous scrip was dated May 24. Brown
took up 2000 (1000 on June 4, and 1000 on June 8).
Market price of shares on June 1,12 s. 3d. to 14s. ; 2nd,
14s. ; 3rd, 13s. to 14s. A delightful unanimity charac-
terised the meeting ; and magnanimity as well —in the in-
clusion of the secretary. The directorate didn’t want to
hog the lot. There’s a heap of good reading locked-up in
the minute-books of Westralian mining-companies.

The rumor that Kaufman had rejoined the
London and Globe Finance co. has not been confirmed
and is probably incorrect. His reply to the secretary’s
statement that innoeventwould his engagement have been
renewed is forcible. —“ Every pressure has been brought
upon me to reconsider my decision, but I have persistently
declined to do so. I was then requested by Mr. Whitaker
Wright to proceed to British Columbia in the interests of
the British American Corporation, and also to negotiate
for the acquisition of certain W.A. properties belonging
to the Associated co. All these requests, however, I de-
clined to entertain. I trust that in the interests not only
of the L. & G. shareholders, but of the W.A. mining in-
dustry generally, the discussion may now end.” Good
advice, no doubt. After the sickening speech made by
Bottomley many persons probably imagined that Kaufman
would want to get back. A bit of it: - “ Those who
know us will say we have ridden a consistent, straight
and honest race in connection with W.A. We have given
full room and berth to all our opponents, with the result
that for some time, far away in front of the rest of the field,
we have been running a neck-and-neck race with one other
group, which I will not further particularise. But, now
that we have secured their first jockey in the person of
my friend on my right, I am certain, knowing the cattle
we have in our stables, knowing the form of our oppon-
ents to the ounce, that with Charles Kaufman up the
W.A. stakes are at our mercy.” “ A Disgusted Share-
holder ” wants to know if the person referred to in such
flattering and hysterical terms is the same O. Kaufman
who advised the purchase and flotation of the Wealth of
Nations, Paddington Consols, Hannan’s Golden Treasure,
Golden Crown, Mainland Consols, Wealth of Nations
Extended, and Hannan’s Golden Group ? If so, he would
like to know how he squares their present position and
market values with his own reports made on these pro-
perties ? Too bad ! Under the Hush ! Hush ! policy of
the L. and G. it was obviously intended that these babes
should pass away in a sweet, undisturbed sleep.

various lines of business down North only two remain,
one with tobacco and timber monopolies, and the other—
Canadian, not Yankee —too ‘ near ’ to lose anything ex-

Transpired at the last half-yearly meeting that
the Koch’s Pioneer Co., one of the most consistent div.-
payers of Bendigo, and owned by about the wealthiest
proprietary (Lansell, Atkinson, the Boyds, and co.), has
been paying its manager £3 a week! Also, the Koch’s
battery is one of the biggest crushers for the public in
the district, and its manager has been getting £3 a week,
too ! Now, after long debating among shareholders,
they’ve had a rise of a whole 10s. a week each. Also, the
directors’ fees are increased from £5O to £lOO a year for
the lot. Lansell participates in the latter extravagance.
This mine has upwards of 100 stamps, and has paid an
occasional div. from the profits of public crushing, as well
as developing the mine out of it. A million tons would
not exhaust the tailings heap, and it includes those from
the Kentish mine, from which Paddy Watson is known to
have taken nine tons of gold.

In a recently-suppressed fraud, the “ firm ” —a

shortage was made up. There was a laudable attempt
made by the wife to save her husband from hominy, but
even the sale of all her belongings left a big sum still
owing. It looked a “ blue duck ” when the man of mani-
pulation suddenly remembered that he held shares in a
local trading concern on which over £20,000 was owing in
unpaid calls. He also remembered that these shares were
transferred to him by the “ firm,” and that he could prove
beyond doubt that he was nothing but a “ dummy.”
Accordingly, he instructed the “firm” of his sudden
recollection, and the threatened prosecution shut up with
a dull sickening thud.

in to adjudicate on the work of artists finds em-
phatic support in the art-judging efforts of the
City Fathers of Sydney. Originally they intended
to have two groups of statuary of absolutely
similar design for the new markets. They
have now decided on a little novelty, and have
ordered a second group. We are told (vide
the daily press) that the central figure of this
second chef d’ceuvre, “holding aloft a torch,” re-
presents “ the genius of civilisation.” He really
looks like an un-uniformed sub-lieutenant making
an awkward salute to the colors in a perfunctory
march-past. Two ladies sit on either side of him,
the one using compasses on a globe at which she is
not looking ; the other writing on a tablet with a
stylus, while her gaze is devouring a tomato-stall
(in futuro) somewhere in the bowels of the
markets.

In a forthcoming “society” scandal,
hubby’s friends are willing to lay odds on the

A N.S.W. policeman tells The

order a mounted escort in country towns,

Godless education again ! At a recent
meeting of the Sydney Builders’ and Contractors’
Association, the deplorable discovery was made
that not one member could name the date of the
approaching Easter Sunday. The mystery that an
ungodly pressman was better posted is easily ex-
plained. The scribe smells holiday-time afar off—
because for him, unhappy wretch, it means double
work !

Another S.A. local-preacher a-missing.
He is an aggressive Wesleyan and teetotaller this
time, but the deficit is just as large as in previous
cases, and the only asset left behind is the usual
halo. This brother was apparently a quiet, in-
offensive man, and there is no evidence at present
of a string of racehorses, or a suburban harem, to
account for the deficiency ; but it is there just the
same.
......
Strange, the similarity in the big S.A. e r ”'-
bezzlement cases. The last “ alleged ” case agrees
with previous ones exactly—Freemason, Recha-
bite, local-preacher. Moreover, each was a pillar
of the church, strict teetotaller, and apparently
led a regular life. Usual explanation from the
auditors : “We never dreamt of such a thing
from such a respected man as Brother -!”
But ask the Guarantee companies how it averages !

Again, “ consider the J.P. how he
performs.” At a Southern township,
recently, the hour for the court to sit
had arrived ; the rural litigant had raked
the straws out of his hair and assembled
in force. Specially clever lawyers had
been brought up from town regardless of
expense, and everything was in order,
when war broke out between two occu-
pants of the bench. “Sir, lam chair-
man of this court ! I am the senior
magistrate, sir ! How dare you, sir ! ”
“How dare you, sir ! I am president of
this shire, sir.” “I’ll see you in Sheol
first, sir ! ” “ And /’ll see you
first, s ir! ” Then the court broke up
in disorder, and the man that was suing
the other man for allowing his cow to
eat two-shillings-worth of his grass, and
the squatter who was bringing an action
to make the selector remove his dead
horse off the front verandah, will have to
wait another month for the “law.”
F The Judge in a recent N.S. W. divorce-suit
found that the husband had received “cruel bat-
teries ” with broom and tongs, and that the
deliberate throwing of carbolic acid in his face
(which utterly destroyed one eye and injured the
other) was also a “cruel beating.” By the way,
how is it that The Bulletin hears nothing of this
carbolic-acid-thrower being prosecuted, while the
Sydney police hustle so desperately after John
Norton because he got a fly on his nose and used
language in a hotel, and tried to put his arm
round a lady’s waist? Also, what about that Wall
case ?

Mrs. Morris, lady missionary in the New

Presbyterian paper: “We make one condition

one of the sad sights we see here is the people
foing about without any clothing.” Why sad?

At Flinders-street station, the other day,
two ladies of the new-woman type stepped into
the smoker. “Smoking carriage, ladies !” called
out several male voices. “Oh yes, we know,”
said one, “ but no gentleman would smoke in the
presence of ladies.” No one took any notice and
the lady pulled down her vest and continued,
“Oh, I see—there are no gentlemen present.”
Then a wretch puffed a blast under her nose and
remarked: “No, madam, we belong to the New

The Argus, always girding at the Vic.
Shops and Factories Act, prints a long par. to the
effect that Premier Turner one afternoon went to
a St. Kilda barber’s for a shave, but found the
shop closed for the weekly half-holiday. Where-
upon Turner cursed the Factories Act, and got
somebody to shave him somehow, that he might
put in a clean appearance at the Mayor’s banquet
an hour later. “As to how the trick was done,”
says the Argus chronicler, “ well, that is a
domestic secret.” Why not suggest a solution of
the mystery in a new nursery rhyme?—
Dr. Lloyd, J.P., of North Melbourne,
Victoria’s Squire of Dames, hearing a recent case,
declared himself a physiognomist and a disciple of
Lavater, and, on the strength of this, pronounced
the complainant to be “ a very respectable
woman,” whose evidence he believed. Which
should induce the man with the broken nose to
take his case as far from Lloyds as possible.

Who shaved G. Turner? From Mrs. T.
His worthy wife,
With carving-knife
She met the case,
And scraped his face
Both up and down ;
Then back to town
Despatched her lord.
At banquet board
He sat, and fed,
With sidelong head,
And stroked his cheek,
Too full to speak.
But, point of fact,
He d —d the Act
Which shut the shop,
And left his crop
Of bristles grey
To find a way
Of getting shorn.
Each blessed morn
Thereafter he
Accepts a scrape;
He can’t escape
His awful doom.
Observe the gloom
That gathers now
Upon his brow,
And all because
Of Peacock’s clause,
Which shut the shop
Of Barber Strop,
And taught a wife
To use the knife
With skilful touch —
Nor cut him much.
The gentle bard,
Who finds it hard
To neatly close
This rhyming prose,
Again will ask
(Here ends the task) :
Who shaved G. Turner?

pointed. There may be a stray quad-
roon or octoroon about, but the

Wragge gives a very simple and lucid expla-
nation of the superiority of the summer climate of
Queensland to that of N.S.W., S.A., and Victoria.
He says that when there exists an area of baro-
metrical depression in the Antarctic, there is a
natural influx towards this area from the north.
Consequently, the hot air from Central Australia,
being violently sucked southward, travels over
Adelaide, Melbourne, and neighboring districts in
its course, and is, naturally, deflected clean away
from Queensland sea-board.

Northern Tasmania has caught the bush-
fire epidemic badly. At “ New Paradise,” on the
N.W. coast, a family loaded a dray with provi-
sions, in case of a surprise, and dragged it clear
of the scrub. Then the fire came along, and, in
quick time, all was swept clean, food and all,
nothing remaining but one wheel of the dray. In
another instance, a woman, carrying a child, had
the boots burnt off her feet in her flight from the
flames. The line of fire near Table Cape was six
miles wide, “and the whole coast smells of roast
potatoes.”

In a far north-western town of N.S.W.
two Totties, elderly and in bad disrepair, were
recently charged with being two Totties within
the meaning of the Act. As a rule, the lady with
the thin tail of hair a-hanging down her back only
gets out into the back-blocks in her old and un-
comely days, and then the bench treats her with
very little consideration. In this case it sternly
ordered the two faded angels of the sidewalk to
gaol for a month, but when they offered to leave
the town the sentence was reduced to 14 days.
Generally the small offender gets off scot free on
promising to leave the town, but at the very
worst she can get her sentence considerably miti-
gated on giving her solemn pledge to go and be
equally obnoxious on somebody else’s premises
—though why the promise to go and be the same
nuisance on somebody else’s premises should be a
mitigation of the offence no one knows. Some
day, on the same principle, the man with the
dirty back-yard will have his fine remitted on his
promise to throw the offal over the fence into the
next fellow’s yard.
Dear Bulletin. —Your remarks on paying
patients in hospitals are to the point. To exclude
a man who can pay would often be a cruelty.
For instance, the man in lodgings. If he gets
sick, he cannot expect proper attention from
strangers, and probably can’t afford to pay his
weekly bill with medical attendance and comforts
superadded. To temporarily transfer himself to
hospital and pay 30s. a week—that is, say, 10s.
more than it has cost him for board and lodging—
is to him the easiest and most satisfactory solu-
tion of his difficulty. Often, too, for many reasons
easily found if sought, it is even preferable that
the family man should go to hospital and pay,
rather than remain at home to the discomfort of
himself and all around him. —M.

At Wallsend (N.S. W.), last week, one man
was charged with biting another’s nose all but off.
“ The evidence tended to show that the men
quarrelled while under the influence of liquor,
and it was mutually decided that they should fight
a duel without weapons in the local cemetery, the
conditions being that the survivor should inter his
victim.” Yet people say the Age of Chivalry is
gone. Did Ivanhoe bury his carcases? Did
Bayard gallantly offer sepulture to a sword-pierced
antagonist—let alone a nose-bitten ditto? No,
Mr. Burke, that Age has just dawned—and in

“Wallaroo”: All over the northern
N.S.W. farming districts eyes and voices are
being raised in solemn thankfulness to the
“ Board ” for providing a glorious harvest —and
destroying it when it had almost reached maturity.
Some flabbergasted farmers, however, are indig-
nantly inquiring what they are to be thankful for ;
but the ecclesiastical eye, ignoring the disastrous
effects of late rain and hail-storms, remains ob-
stinately fixed on the flourishing crops of three
months ago, and the harvest festival farce is to
be carried out with due solemnity. What a howl
of holy horror would arise if, in place of the
wizened vegetables, pinched grain, and maggoty
fruit, the churches were decorated with Starve-ali,
Fat-hen, and similar agricultural triumphs ! Of
these alone have we an abundant crop.
* * * *
About the.hollowesb of all the hollow little
devices to which churches and chapels have to
resort in order to keep the parson’s pot boiling is
the “ harvest thanksgiving ” —celebrated whether
there’s been a harvest to gather or not. If there
hasn’t been any—well, they have to go out and
buy the pumpkins, that’s all. But with many of
the type who run the churches, buying is a beastly
bore ; and it was quite characteristic of these
people’s methods that lately a couple of “highly
respected ” church officers should have been taken
in the act of pilfering from the basket-reed plan-
tation alongside a Vic. prison. Yet, poor devils,
one can’t help sympathising with them in these
days of fierce competition, when the big drum has
to be banged more vigorously than ever it had to
be banged before.
What humorists you do find among the clergy !
In a city church not long ago, among the “harvest
festival” decorations were water-melons and
carrots, also turnips, doubtless Chow-grown.
Thanking God for having sent us Chinamen !

According to Prof. Schenck, of Vienna,
sex is primarily a mere matter of victuals. Ex-
periments conducted among families of his inti-
mates justify him, he says, in asserting that by
means of diet women can be made to bear sons or
daughters at will. The prospective papa will now
be able to form definite resolutions about his son
(yet unborn, but sex-fed and scientifically fixed
up), and the mother will be able to dream of his
straight legs and his blue eyes, his courtship, mar-
riage, and settlement in life. Which would be all
pleasant enough but for the fact that Schenck
can’t establish, on the food-basis, the character of
the unborn brat. Also, the lady may entertain an
opposite desire to that of her husband in the sex
of the approaching pledge. And, though she
might ostensibly follow the prescribed regimen
when under observation, she would not fail to eat
in secret of the forbidden fruit, the result of which
opposition of diet-forces would possibly be of a
nature to interest the proprietor of a dime museum.
Altogether, Schenck may have carried his investi-
gations too far to be profitable to society. It is
enough to know that man is what he eats —when
he can get anything to eat —and it is uselessly
irritating to know that he may also be what his
mother eats.

THE POETS MEANING
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
SOULFUL person lightly tapped
The Poet's blistered door ;
His brow was broad , his mien was rapt ,
| An anxious look he wore.
He knocked again and yet again,
Then heard the poet rise
And stub his toe and swear hi pain
At someone's blanky eyes.
He wept to hear the Poet curse
And through the window yell ,
“ You hawkers here get worse and worse
Clear out of this to H —//”
The soulful person called : “ I'm not
hawker , as you think ;
I'm one who seeks the Sacred Spot
Where kindred souls can link.
“ I seek the cultured , flowing tide
That common clay has not."
The Poet spoke. “ Then come inside ,
Do?i’t stand there talking rot."
“/ thank you , sir " the stranger said ;
“ I've worshipped now Jor years
The art that has my fancy fed.
The art that forced my tears.
“ Your every ode , and verse and hymn
Rolls in my memory.”
The Poet grinned , and it was grim—
“ You've got more time than me."’
“ And now I wish that you would say,"'
The other paused intent ,
“ When you penned this exquisite lay
Exactly what you meant."
The Poet thought . “ That's hard , because
Perhaps 1 never knew
As far as / remember 'twas
To make a bob or two."

How is a woman to manage a Man ?
Flatter and fondle as much as she can ;
Gammon and grieve when her cooking’s amiss ;
Bid him good-bye with a lingering kiss,
Welcome him back with expression of glee,
Smile all the time "he is taking his tea.
Laugh at his jokes, though she knows them of old;
Never reply when it suits him to scold,
Nor question his statements, whatever she think,
Should “ work in the city,” smell strongly of drink.
Bear half of his troubles, and all of her own ;
Reprove him at times —in a worshipful tone.
Preserve her good looks till her figure grows stout,
Then gently and tenderly peg herself out,
Leaving him free in new bachelor life
To maudle, at times, o’er the loss of his wife—
Her tombstone recording—“ Here lies Mary Ann,
Who died of the effort to Manage a Man.”

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
~ Sydney, February 22, 1898.
My Dear Myee—
The bold, bad insurance-canvasser has already
marked as his prey the welcome little stranger
sleeping innocently in his first-quality cot up at
Govt. House. To be first in the field for the
Gov.’s grandchild would be a grand ad. for any
enterprising co., and Advertisement has marked
the aristocratic cherub for its own from birth.
An enterprising lady-visitor called on Capt. Fer-
guson the other day, and, after preliminaries,
worked in a casual hint that the company which
she represented would be proud and ’appy to give
a policy for the darling. And the wearied-out
parent replied with a tired sigh: “My dear
madam, you are the thirty-seventh person who
has asked me to insure that baby’s life.”
Vic. R. and I. is being extensively used as an
advt. for the Albani concert-boom by an astute
promoter, who knows that loyalty at advanced
rates can be made a delirious success if properly
worked. People who don’t know any tunes, and
°7*'y recognise the National Anthem because
they feel grateful to it for winding-up so many
evenings of boredom, have booked their seats with
a reverent idea of gazing on a lady who often
drops in casually on H.M. for afternoon tea and a
little gossip. Since the days of S. Bernhardt no
new-comer has caused such a neck-craning and
tip-toeing to behold her, and Sarah travelled quite
on her own without any royal backing. The Aus-
tralia is doing big business at lunch-time, for
curious persons stroll in, j n hopes of seeing the
tuneful visitor.
A few musicians and a large section of public—
the well-dressed and white-skirted kind of public
—went to the mayoral reception of Albani in the
Town Hall on Monday afternoon. Leading
musicians were absent in large numbers, in that
they hadn’t received the necessary pasteboard,
the cards having been dealt out promiscuous-like
with large hiatuses in the lists. It was an un-
satisfactory grovel at first, as the company had to
prowl about the corridors and put their heads in
at all the doors of the Mayoress’s suite of rooms
to get a glimpse of the recepted diva, but after-
wards they sat down in the big hall and plaved
the organ at her, and sitting between Mayor and
Mrs. Harris, and flanked by Mr. Albani and
J. C. Williamson, she looked in custody and as if
she couldn t run away even if she wanted to.
Albani’s pictures don’t do her any sort of justice;
she isn’t nearly as fat and dull and commonplace
as her picture-libels show her. She was gowned
in ivory white with spangly sparkles, and a purple
bonnet with a veil to match topped her off. Her
co. sat back respectfully, Miss Berry’s smashed-up
tomato-colored hat showing up, and Miss Clench,
the violinist, unremarkable in white. The
Mayoress, in a black-and-yellow silk, rose to
the occasion. Orlando Harley, as one who knew
his way about, went off on his own, and left the
shivoo early. Mr. Gye was playing the r6le of a
celebrity’s husband with quiet force. Florence
Schmidt, in a grass-lawn frock, was led up and
introduced as a promising local product. Mrs.
Burdekin in bright pink, Mrs. J. Brunton in a
frilly muslin, and a copper-haired girl in green
and pink, helped to give the afternoon a fashion-
able tone—which was needed. Most of the
musical women gloomed in black, and the men
were shabby some wore tweedy greys and
browns. Signor Hazon’s hair stood more erect
than ever with pleasure as he chatted to his old
friend the new conductor. The music was pro-
vided by the “ Firm’s ” orchestra in the corridor,
and songs were sung by H. W-hrand Miss Leitch,
W. and M.’s new voice.
A stern man at the door pounced on all cards,
and nobody was admitted without a displayed
invitation. Begging for invites raged until
almost the hour of opening the ball. At the
theatre-office, a string of applicants filed in all
morning, and even sat patiently waiting until
fired by impatient officials. And all the inviting
was done by the civic authorities. All the mem-
bers of the “ French Maid ” co. were absent, and,
except by Mr. Bracy, the profession was almost
unrepresented.
The Albani arrival at Redfern was a frost. So
thought the waiting welcomers of the musical pro-
fession and sundry sight - rushers, who were
patiently lined-up on the platform, on the look-
out for the Melb. express. But Albani, escorted
by husband Gye, and taken in tow by J.C.W.,
was hustled off into her waiting conveyance, with-
out a glance to right or left, and all the snubbed
welcome-delegation tailed sorrowfully home again
with unshaken hands.
Mayor Harris has determined to shut down on
pushers, and has decided that the only way to
curb the numerous greedy throng that fastens on
to every local little tin-god for what it can get out
of him is to hang ou 1 no inducement whatever in
the way of free feeds and dances to the self-seek-
ing fringe of sassiety. The wholesale cadging for
invitations that goes on before every big public
entertainment, especially if the party includes any
gratis refreshments, is nothing better than a high-
toned version of “the eight o’clock rush” at a
charitable eating-house. No more banquets and
no ball—a great set-back for the noble army of
sassiety sundowners. But— Mayor Harris made
rather a sad mess of his first invitation-list—that
is to say, if the catalogue of those invited to meet
Mme. Albani was really intended to be musically
represen tati ve.
Last week’s mail-boat took away for an English
sojourn Mr. and Mrs. Alf. Marks, who, three
years ago, were the hero and heroine of a much-
discussed love-match, the bride being Claire
Leighton of the Gaiety Co. Contrary to pro-
phesyings of some kind friends, the tall, fair ex-
G.G. settled down naturally to country life, and
after her ruralising at St. Mary’s, where she and
her husband had their home, has lost none of her
good looks. As she is innocent of make-up or
peroxide and doesn’t totter about on four-inch
heels, she is a disappointment to those good folk
who like to imagine every woman from behind the
curtain a mask of artificiality. She is an ardent
backer of horses, and as such regularly turned up
at every meeting important enough to have one
bookie there to lay the odds. A fellow-traveller
by the Noney Seabrook, formerly leading
lady with Thornton, leaves Australia after a
chequered career of 18 months.
Somebody asked baritone Pauli, at the Albani
flurry on Monday afternoon, if he intended mak-
ing a long stay in Australia. The clean-shaven
singer s reply was worthy of Ryley : “I shall, if
the girls are nice,” he pronounced, sweeping an
approving glance at the groups around him.
Ordinary country folk are so much scared at the
exclusiveness of Ranji and co. that they now hesi-
tate before offering them any civility, lest it
should be met with discouragement and chill. It
would appear that the reason why they did not
take part in the dance got up in their honor at
Glen Innes was that, owing to timidity in ap-
proaching the guests, none of the promoters of the
hop led forward partners for them !
Interest waned in the last week’s cricket struggle.
Clem. Hill doesn t as yet rival His Royal Darkness
as a draw, for only a scattered hundred women
watched him make that duck on Friday—to be
atoned for by a brilliant score in the next innings.
Ivext to the women who pose as cricket innocents
and gabble continually inane questions, in the
hope that some lurking scribe may hear them and
quote them in print, are the cricket critics with a
pet scrap of technicality which they apply to
every bit of play. A distressingly well-informed
girl on Friday capped every move with her criti-
cism of “loose fielding,” and everybody around
her looked impressed until seventy times seven,
and then they eyed her with suspicious misgiving.
A refreshing point about an inter-Australian match
is the absence of the professional and amateur
feeling. When the English team drove to the
gates before their late match with N.S.W., it was
instructive to see the hirelings drop off and humbly
hump their own baggage inside, while “the
gentlemen” were driven stylishly inside the
grounds right up to the entrance. That kind of
thing makes one squirm, as somehow in Australia
everyone feels that sport should mean camaraderie.
The wedding of Miss May Roberts with Mr.
Ambrose Pratt, which happened at St. Mary’s last
Wednesday afternoon, was an extensively-clothed
ceremony—there was more white satin and orange-
blossom to the square inch than in any fashionable
fixing-up for some time in this city. The bride’s
train was a billowing wake behind her as she
walked up to have the knot tied, and her lace and
floral top-hamper were handed down from the
wedding of her sister, who made a match under
romantic circumstances a few years ago. The
chief robe and most of the others were made by
Hordern Bros. The bride’s stock of store-clothes
is calculated to last her until far into the future.
At the subsequent health-drinking at the bride’s
home, the brilliant novelty of speechless toasts
was introduced—a precedent that ought to be
widely followed by an overspeeched-at and
preached-at generation.
One of the passengers to Sydney this voyage of
the China is a Sydney girl, Miss Inez Bensusan,
who left here some two years ago to make a bid
for fame and fortune on the stage, and has now
come home for a holiday. She had a welcome-
home tea-drinking last week, and discoursed in-
terestingly to her guests about her doings and
sight-seeings in London and other parts of Eng-
land, where she toured with the Kendals. Ter-
riss’s funeral was the last event which Miss Ben-
susan witnessed before leaving London. The
scene in Brompton Cemetery showed a wild
struggle of spectators to see the “ show,” men and
women furiously pushing each other and trampling
vigorously over graves and flower-beds in their
eagerness to behold the sensational burying.
Among Australians in Fogland Nellie Stewart
was holding up her end of the log in the “ Scarlet
Feather” by her taste in stage-costumes, and
looked as young as when Australia last saw her
shapely form, but Decima Moore had gone off
both in singing and fascination. Miss B. saw
“Charlotte Corday” at Islington. The house
was papered and cold, and the doleful drammer
didn’t draw.
As Nancy, in the Lyceum drama, Lilian
Wheeler wears ankle-revealing skirts for the first
time in her stage career, and is graceful as the
sweetheart of the long-legged sailor, Walner
Gregory. But her neat-waisted prettiness doesn’t
indicate the muscles of the vigorous young woman
who throws off two able-bodied men when they
attempt to lock her up at the villain’s bidding.
There is much clawing and pawing in the play.
Every character clutches every other character.
The villain is a perfect octopus at grabbing, and
the hero’s principal occupation is dragging him off
every member of the cast in turn.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ The Freeman-Thomases are giving a ‘servants’
and tradesmens’ ’ ball preparatory to their de-
parture from Melbourne. Mrs. F-T. sighs for
the pleasures of London and won’t come back
with her pa. The question is, who will come back
with him ? Shaftesbury is gone, leaving a trail of
smoke-room anecdotes (and other things) behind
him; Freeman-Thomas is not returning; and
Dicky Nevill has family troubles on hand. The
Brassey household, in fact, is bursting up, and will
want replenishing.
“ Mr. Byron Moore, enlarging on the predatory
habits of the women who visit the ladies’ retiring-
room on the lawn at Flemington, declares that
they remove everything portable, set after set of
toilet - services disappearing in one day. The
V.R.C. now chains everything to the walls but the
soap and the hairpins, and these commodities have
to be laid in by the ton. On the Hill, according
to the secretary, there is comparatively little lost.
He cannot explain why. I can. To remove a
toilet-set on the Hill is thieving ; to remove one
on the Lawn is merely kleptomania.
“ Invitees flocked to the Mayoress’s welcoming
of Albani, and flounced into the Town Hall
between two mobs of cardless women who had
evidently come with the idea of being able to get
through ‘on the nod.’ Mrs. M'Eacharn, with
her agonised society smile in full working order,
pump-handled everybody on entrance, and the
illustrious Albani followed suit. She so smilingly
greeted everybody that she made them feel as if
she would like to take them in and introduce ’em
to the Royal Family if she should ever happen to
meet them outside Windsor Castle.
“ The crowd passed the hostess and her show
guest, and then sought a point of vantage from
which to gaze their full upon the judiciously-
advertised warbler. Then, for the first time, was
noticed J. C. Williamson, positively effulgent, and
visibly swollen with the importance of the occa-
sion. Propping up the door-post stood his satel-
lite, the ever-juvenile Henry Bracy, resplendent
in a grey frock suit and nursing tenderly a tile
which would have served admirably as a mirror.
Meekly in the background were the other two
ladies of the new concert co. The contralto, of
the usual fleshy order, aired a fawny pink-looking
gown, striped wonderfully with peach-color, and
a hat of startling pink with puce flowers. The
little violiniste looked fetching in a demure frock
and hat of palest grey. Caron’s band pounded
away down the corridor at various operas favored
by Mme. Albani, and occasional squalls from the
distance announced a concert in progress.
“When the people had gazed sufficiently at the
cantatrice in the Mayor’s room a desire for novelty
impelled them to the Council Chamber, whence
the wails proceeded, and soon the Mayoress and
the show guests rustled in and took front seats.
Alice Coy chortled pleasingly ; Maggie Sterling
gasped through a sentimental ditty; dolly Walter
Kirby plaintively bleated to some unknown she
‘Good night, sweet love.’ Regina Nagel (when
is she going ’Orae to study ?) devoted her beautiful
voice to murdering a ditty of the heart-broken
order.
“ Then came the scramble for tea and ices by
the women—the Mayor had been considerate for
the men and provided something with a big stick
in it.. Actor Wilson Barrett and his ladies were
formidable rivals to the singers, and, during the
first part of the afternoon, the eminent actor’s
anxiety about the non-arrival of his leading lady,
and his fidgety hunt in and out for her, caused
some amusement. Finally, he stationed himself
at the head of the stairs, and when La Belle
Jeffries arrived at a fashionably late hour greeted
her rapturously and conducted her to the hostess.
The Silver King by daylight, despite his bright
brown hair with the bottle-brush-front effect, dis-
appointed romantic girls by looking—well, older
and less interesting than on the stage. Mrs.
M‘Eacharn cut a fashionable dollish figure in a
pale blue rig-out with a white and blue hat; while
the one and only Albani looked big, handsome, and
gracious, in a grey brocade which could stand
alone, worked up with ivory lace and glittering
with cut steel crowned by a toque of violets and
crimson roses—also a violet veil, which behaved
cruelly to her complexion. Maud Jeffries posed
her massive, proportions admirably, and aired a
sweet thing in black and blue ; with a floppy black
hat of the picture order. Languishing Lillah
McCarthy sported white, in which lace played a
prominent part. Her mushroom-like hat had two
sweeping feathers resting on the brim in the style
loved by ’Arriet. Daisy Belmore also went in for
a white effect, and faced the public in a white
silk gown, without a wrinkle, which looked
as though glued on. Sassiety generally, which
turned up in strong force, wore its best
bib and tucker for the occasion. Mrs. Croker
was in sable garb ; Mrs. Rupert Carington sported
white, with a blob of intense blue for headgear.
And so on. Mrs. Sandes, nee Claire Berry, was a
modest form in smoke-grey, which trailed the
ground, and made her look still a foot or so taller.
“At the Albani reception the women gazed at
the great singer \\ ith awe and reverence, for the
fact was whispered about —as though it were
Albani’s only t'itle to fame—‘ She is a friend of
the Queen’s ; the Queen likes to hear her sing. ’ It
is difficult to imagine how being the favorite
songstress of a dull old lady with an obsolete
musical taste and imperfect hearing would add
one laurel-leaf to an artist’s reputation, and to
trot out the royal friendship as Albani’s great
‘double-barrel ’ is nothing short of an insult to
that artiste’s magnificent gift. During the recep-
tion Mr. Albani distributed smiles and hand-
shakes and played the part of the celebrity’s hus-
band with a good deal of power. And at the con-
cert every artist sang straight at the great singer
as much as to say ‘ What do you think of my little
lot ? ’ The vice-regal carriage and Lord R. Neville
appeared at five o’clock and whisked Albani and
husband off to Govt. House where they stayed
till Friday afternoon —when they left, for Sydney
by express.
“ Like David Copperfield’s dinner-party, ‘ The
Squire of Dames ’ first night would have gone off
ever so much better if everyone hadn’t been so
genteel. An icy air of most pronounced ‘ toney-
ness ’ and correctness pervaded the whole house
and made the atmosphere almost chilly, although
the glass stood above the nineties. On the stage a
hard frost of top-loftiness set in soon after the
raising of the curtain, and continued increasing
in severity until the four small acts and three
gigantic intervals came to an end. All the
women seemed much too ‘ smart ’ to infuse
any life or meaning into their high - toned
parts, so that interest in anything but their
superb finery was impossible from the beginning,
but every woman of them scored heavily as a
dressmaker’s model. As each fresh confection
was trailed behind the footlights, every woman in
front recognised that all the gowns in her own
wardrobe were hopelessly obsolete. Godets have
disappeared, and fibre chamois as skirt-lining is
entirely wiped out, for skirts are now droopy,
narrow about the knees, and ‘waggle-tailed,’ sug-
gesting the mode common in photos, of belles of
the year ’75. The latest snap in sleeves appears to
be to have them skin-tight (shoulder frilling is
absolutely dead), and terminating much above
the wrist. Of the four gorgeous creations worn
by Beatrice Lamb (who much resembles
Constance Deorwyn, by the way), the most
admired was a walking dress of amber
brocade, elaborately trimmed with cinnamon
velvet; though she looked at her best in the dinner-
gown of rose-pink bengaline most fascinatingly
fixed with fine, black lace. A young lady of
Bernhardtian contour, appropriately named
‘ Getthyn ’ Darragh, struggled slightly with an
American twang, but the prevalent top-loftiness
soon got the better of her and she dropped it for
‘culchawed’ English tones. Her chief success
was a lime-green satin dinner-gown beruched and
beflounced. The inaudible Katherine Stewart
swept four very handsome trains over much hand-
some furniture, and seemed deeply depressed
at having to own ‘Elsie’—a lank child with
vast lengths of red arms and black feet who
suffered painfully from stage-fright. The ever-
brilliant Cartwright was the Clem. Hill of the co.
He seems not to have added an hour to his age
since he was last here. Thursby is a well-set-up
person distinguished for his shoulders and his side
and his knack of comic song in private. On the
voyage out the whole company was busy study-
ing and had little time to fritter away in ship-
board flirtation. Beatrice Lamb daily sought
upper-deck seclusion and pored over bulgy MSS.
“ ‘ Smart ’ Melb. was much in evidence clus-
tered round the vice-regal box and in the stalls.
Mrs. Freeman-Thomas, blithe as usual in black
with many diamonds, and Mrs. ‘ Big ’ Clarke 11.,
emerging from mourning for the first time and
sporting a vivid rose-pink gown, were the most
admired women in the circle. In a box with Mrs.
Rickards was Cartwright’s pretty daughter—a
fluffy-haired girl with a vivacious face, who will
appear in the next piece the eo. produces.
“ The ‘ blushing modesty ’ and reticence which
one time were considered necessary adjuncts to
every bride are scornfully laughed out-of-date by
the new woman. A pretty Melb. girl, always
noted for her ‘ advanced ’ ideas, was married, the
other day, to a professional man from another
province. The wedding, a very simple ceremony
and absolutely ungarnished by the usual orange-
blossom, favors, rose-leaves, &c., was followed by
a dance, at which bride and groom were present
and danced energetically till dawn. Then the
happy pair, with a large party of assorted friends,
caught the early boat to a down-the-bay resort,
where the honeymoon was spent amidst a large
and giddy house-party.
“A fierce and exciting scene took place last
week in the lobby of the House between two dele-
gates. There had been an ancient enmity between
the pair till Federal proceedings patched up a
kind of armed truce. This was broken the other
day by a chance word of one of them. The bigget
of the two men instantly and emphatically chal-
lenged his adversary to ‘ come out and fight,’ and
he seemed to be quite ready till other delegates
stepped between and separated the combatants.
“At Caulfield, on Saturday, the Y.A.T.C.
meeting encountered so hot a day that frocks
with little beyond coolness to recommend them
were more successful than less seasonable costumes
of ten times the value. Miss Maude Jeffries, in
white muslin, wore hat, veil, and silk sash all to
match. The Convention delegates, invited by the
committee to lunch and afternoon tea, arrived in
force, with their womenkind. Premier Forrest,
in ‘ slummocky ’ tweed suit and overgrown black
boxer, escorted both his nieces—one in heliotrope,
the other in yellow, tucked and ruched with
buttercup chiffon.
“ Apropos theatrical waist-line. Mummers,
like vocalists, often pant comparatively early in
life under a burden of flesh into which they were
not born. Hygienic theorists trace the unroman-
tio plumpness of ex-stars of melodrama, and the
aggressive embonpoint of pantomine ‘boys,’ to
vocal athletics and consequent chest-expansion.
Steamboat officials, whose pet passengers are not
pros., have their own interpretation of the parable
of the ‘ fat kine ’of stageland. ‘ Theatricals are
greedier and cheekier than commercials,’ these
experienced observers will tell you.
“ Exile Willard, with dark hair falling over his
pallid brow, palpably knowsa thing or two re grace-
ful arm and leg deportment d la Wilson Barrett.
His returned-colonist coat is free-and-easy about
the neck, and, when he takes it off to escape from
prison, it is evident that the Byronic collar effect
is due to the shirt having been cut in a ‘ V.’
‘Studied carelessness ’ with a vengeance ! Moya
Deorwyn wears a scarlet cloak and shows her
ankles in proper colleen fashion. His Reverence
Holloway, milder and less jolly than the ordinary
stage-priest, boasts a glossy top-hat, and Daisy
Coppin, with gown uplifted over a jaunty blue
petticoat, takes energetic part in an Irish jig.
“ On the whole, the Convention women have
kept the pace wonderfully this meeting. A few
of them have even ‘ chummed-up,’ and some of
the girls are off to Sydney, presently, to witness
the wedding of a delegate’s daughter.
“ The Austral Salon Committee has shaken the
dust of precedent off its feet and provided a bag
of new notions for 1898. Henceforth each mem-
ber can only entertain one outside friend per
month, but, by way of compensation, the hostess
for the day may ask 50 acquaintances of her own.
This innovation really should encourage hospi-
tality. A hostess invites 50 of her very
own chums to central rooms with many
conveniences. Leading lights of the club
provide the music, &c., gratis. In return, she lets
sister members and associates, and a few of their
friends, have a cup of her tea and a morsel of her
cake. On Tuesday evening (Feb. 22nd), the Salon
is booked to take formal leave of its clever
habituee, elocutioniste Charlotte Hemming off to
show her professional paces in the ‘ big smoke.’
On the following Monday (28th), Salonites will lay
their farewell tribute at the shrine of the Wilson
Barrett company.”
“ From 23 to 30 years ago Melbourne was
startled by a romance of which the facts never
came fully to light. Wild, mysterious yarns of
elopement, conversion and priestly interference
were whispered freely at the time, but nothing
definite became known. Romeo’s father, satisfied
that the son of a great statesman had riot de-
meaned himself by marriage with a mere actress,
left his will unaltered, and 15 years later his vast
estates fell in due course to the principal in the
romance, who has, up to now, always been re-
garded by the world as a hopeless bachelor; for
though numberless opportunities of marriage with
well-gilt and attractive women presented them-
selves, he passed by on the other side. Now, some
years after the old man’s death, Romeo comes out
with the announcement that ‘Mr. and Mrs.
are at their town residence.’ That lady.has been
Mrs. since the date of the original romance
in the early seventies. A well-kept secret.
‘‘At the Royal, Grattan Riggs’ ‘Shaughraun’
is beguiling enough to ‘ come the comether ’ over
an audience of Orangemen. Nevertheless, the
‘endearing young charms’ of the light-heeled,
quiek-tongued Irish bhoy lack one essential, to
wit, an unobtrusive waist-line.
“The Vic. Governor, when it suits him, can be
quite ‘ a merry old soul ’! Surely, in his long life,
he must have suffered as much as most of us at
the hands of the drawing-room elocutioniste; yet
it’s wonderful, at this time of day, to see him en-
tering into her hackneyed tommy-rot with ap-
parent zest, and shaking his elderly sides with
well-simulated glee. Sometimes the nice old thing
exerts himself to keep up a brisk fire of sotto voce
comment, or answers the reciter’s would-be artless
questions as if he thought she really wanted to
know, you know!
Yours faithfully,

As The Bulletin prophesied some months
ago, Lawyer Geake has beaten the Vic. authori-
ties who, after extraditing* and convicting him for
one crime, proceeded to punish him for another.
Geake made out a masterly statement of his case
which was referred to England for decision. The
result means that his contemplated confinement is
shortened by two years.
Crick, M.P., is
rather off-hand in his
manner, and does not
study conventional
hand-shakings and
other symptoms of
candidature. During
the last election he rode
40 miles one day, ac-
companied by his faith-
ful friend, “Mick”
Meagher, and .a guide
who knew the coun-
try. Arrived at their
destination, “Mick”
Meagher, shocked at the
apparent coldness of his
candidate towards the
electors, reproved him
in private and assured
him thatsome departure
from his careless style
was necessary. “All
right,” said Crick, “if
I must I must;” and
he went outside and,
seizing the first man he
met, shook hands
warmly, inquired cor-
dially after his wife and
children, and i expressed
a hope that the crops
and seasons were all
right The man replied to these demonstra-
tions with a look Of blank amazement. “ They
don t seem to be much impressed,” said Crick to

Mick. That’s the man who rode 40 miles

Henri Rochefort, who, it is cabled, has

made N.b.W. hand over the batch (Rochefort in

late JJaNud Buchanan, as a token of admiration,
very fecotchly gave him a walking-stick.

Purves, Q.C., is not strong on Scripture.
A short time back he got publicly bogged in the

arising.out of Orange and Green differences he

. Q* : “ ‘ M‘Gr.’s ’ and ‘Rap’s’ generalisa-
tions on convicts’ facial expressions are superficial
and valueless. Clean-shave almost any man—saint
or sinner-wearing a full beard, and he will pro-
bably look hideous, simply because beards are so
often worn to hide unbeautiful features. To begin
with, most men are ugly, and mere ugliness goes
lor nothing whatever as a criterion of criminality.
As a class, criminals, high or low, arc as handsome
as any other class—priests, journalists, or any
other crowd, for example. Some of the ugliest
men on record have been the most intellectual and
eminent Johnson, Gibbon, Renan, and others.”
The other day while Gov. Brassey was
attending an Executive Council, an old dead-beat
planked himself alongside the vice-regal carriage
and informed the man on the box-seat that he was
blanky well to stay there till the blanky
Governor gave him a shilling. In due course
Brassey and the lath-like Lord Dicky Nevill
Bailed out, and were saluted jovially by the sun-
downer, but without result, which so disgusted
the man of the roads that he remarked : “ Garn,
yer blanky, stuck-up, old blanker ; yer father was
only a blanky navvy on a railway‘line ! ” Then
the vehicle rolled away, leaving a few mud-spots
on the ancient as a memento.
Papua Macgregor has been accused of
likely to succeed Gormanston as Governor
of Tasmania. Wrong. He would refuse it, as he
believes himself entitled to the vice-kingdom of a
first-class Crown colony. Macgregor is out Ccesar

government ” directing him.
The rumored appointment of Sir William
M Guinea as next Governor of Tasmania is not
causing much stir in the Land of Sleep. As
a money-distributing medium—the chief excuse
for a Governor in tearful Tassie— M“Gregor can’
not be much more Scotch than his Irish prede-
cessor. Hence the lack of excitement.
G.B. ; “ Former Melb. P.-M. Call used to
afford quite a humorous relief from colleague
Panton. Once, when the writer was fined for
taking a dog through Fitzroy Gardens, he ven-
tured to remind Mr. Call that he (C.) had himself
offended in the same way. ‘ Quite right,’ said
Call,; ‘make the declaration, and I’ll pay the
fine. It was done—and the newspaper man came
out on top for once. ”
Some years back a notorious Brisbane (Q.)
embezzler, out on bail, drove up to the local
Supreme Court in a neat little pony-trap, from
which he stepped, well-gloved, and with overcoat
over his left arm. “ Call for me at five,” he said
to his coachman. At five he was in the cells
under sentence of a few years. Which recalls the
dinner that Alphonse Bechet ordered at Sydney
Metropolitan to celebrate his acquittal. lie did

AT THE WAXWORKS.—112° IN THE SHADE.
Justice has not yet been done to the
beauties of S.A. Federation delegate Vaiben L.
Solomon. Vaiben L. has a big, oiled, glossy,
black beard, glossy black eyes, a glossy black hat,
a glossy black necktie, glossy black clothes, and
glossy black patent-leather boots. There is a
sheen all down him, and a high light on his feet.
Also Vaiben L. is quick of speech and occasionally
saucy, and has a secret idea that if. the Queen of
Sheba were to reincarnate she would know him
again at once. It is told of Vaiben L. that at an
election meeting a well-irrigated elector asked
him, “ Are you Solomon the wise man who built
the Temple?” “No,” said he, “I am Solomon
the fool who built the Arcade.” This same joke
is told of Johnny Solomon, who built a theatre,
but it isn’t an uncommon thing for one joke to do
for two Solomons.
By the death of Thomas Bracken—he died
in poverty after a long and hopeless illness—
Maoriland loses a genuine poet, an intense lover
of his adopted country, and a highly-attractive,
all-round personality. Bracken’s varied life ex-
periences left him to the end a thorough Irishman
of the peculiar Celtic stamp in which rollicking
merry-heartedness so strangely co-exists with the
more melancholic order of pathos and the gently
pessimistic tendency exemplified in the subjoined
verses (printed many years ago in The Bulletin).
They are perhaps as good as anything else
Bracken has written :
The blind faith of the man
who buys a bottle of infallible hair
restorer from a bald barber, is dis-
counted (at Jewish rates) by that
of the shrewd Melb. bank manager
who, a few weeks ago, paid 2s. extra for a young
rosella on the verbal guarantee of the shoeless
vendor that the bird was a male. Fact!
Adelaide citizens, who had not seen rain
for five months, were visited the other day with a

Oppositionists—broke out into beautiful poetrv.
A hunk : v J
Some cried : “ Will heaven upon us pour
Such maddening.heat for evermore ?
Has God forsook the human race?
Has He withdrawn his love and grace?”

putes in Adelaide.
Lond. Saturday Review says of “XXI.
Poems,” by Chris. Brennan—the smart young
Sydneyite who graduated at Sydney University,
and now shakes long locks as an assistant in
N.S.W. Public Library
Mr. Brennan’s work is interesting and puzzling : he
seems to have, very acutely and subtly, the poetic sense,
but hardly the poetic voice. His poems impress one, for
the most part, as being cold, fastidious translations from
some beautiful original, written in alien metres, which
the translator has tried conscientiously to convey. Thus
the actual verbal expression and rhythm have seldom
any keen .charm about them, vet there seems to be some
underneath smouldering of poetry.
But it is rather a “ precious ” than a poetical piece
which the reviewer selects for justificatory quota-
tion.
“ Dr. Lennox Browne, the fashionable
Portland Place surgeon,” writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent, “bestowed upon one of
his serving-maids an honor which an unsenti-
mental Bench decided required ss. a week to
support. ‘ Larynx ’ Browne, as he is most widely
known, attends all theatrical she-vocalists for
throat troubles free of charge, and has reaped a
splendid advertisement therefrom. But this
departure from the ‘ blazed ’ track means prac-
tical ruin, although the case was one of black-
mailing impure and unsimple, as Dr. Browne had
already paid a lump sum. As a further foolish-
ness, he endeavored to get the Times to suppress
all account of the police-court proceedings, where-
upon, of course, the virtuous heavyweight rose at
the insult and erected half-a-column in its next
issue.”

TEACHER OF BUSH SCHOCL (on a wet day, to solitary pupil): “Form—fours! ”
Some men have all the luck. Several
years back an important personage from Siam
arrived in Newcastle (N.S.W.), and the raggedest
of local reporters was sent to interview him. The
pressman seized the golden opportunity to impress
the visitor with the importance of having a white
amanuensis. About five years later, a bell-
toppered young man, with lavender kid gloves
and a sweet smile, stalked into the local Herald
office and asked the editor—haw—to notify that
the “ private secretary to the King of Siam” was
touring Australia. Astonishment couldn’t have
been greater if the frayed reporter had been sud-
denly transformed into Archangel William of
Germany.
Related of a N.S.W. station-manager and
well known judge of merinos, that he was travel •
ling with his wife in a backblocks coach, when a
fellow - passenger proceeded to fill and light his
pipe. The s.m. said the lady objected to smoke.
“ Perhaps I may chew ? ” said the passenger.
“Yes, you can chew,” replied the s.m., “but, if
you spit, I’ll be the death of you.”
Louis Becke writes from London :
Dear Bdlletin, —lie the article in your issue of 4th
December. 1897, under the heading of “ A Modern Buc-
caneer.” Your statement of the case is perfectly correct,
save for the fact that “Rolf Boldrewood ” d.d make an
honorable acknowledgment of his indebtedness to the
author of “ By Reef and Palm ” for the material in “ A
Modern Buccaneer.’’ In the second edition of the work,
published by Macmillan in 1894, you will .see l lie acknow-
ledgement on a fly-leaf of that melancholy book.
Ferule: “Demise. George Morrison, head
of Geelong Academy. The most comprehensively
learned of our pundits, but not quite such a good
tutor as his brother Alexander, identified with
Melb. Scotch College almost since the memory- of
man. George fathered the gentleman who walked
over Australia and China. It is noticeable how
extra-smart brothers go in trios, and there were
three Morrisons, the third being about the fore-
most Glasgow pedagogue. Of the three Higin-
bothams, George and Thomas always held that
the other surpassed them. The three clever
Frondes were the historian, the theologian,
and the mathematician. And there were, three

John Burke O’Brien has his name spelt
out, as a drunk, on nearly every M.L. police
court’s charge-sheet. When public-trustee Martin
was a P.M. Burke came before him in Wellington.
He cut John (who is a Ranji.) short, and said,
“ Look here, I’ll give you a show to leave town,
but if you come here again I’ll send you up for
three months. Next morning the first name
called was John Burke O’Brien. Before the beak
could say a word the drunk, loq Your Wor-
ship, being a magistrate meself and having been
High Sheriff of the county of Limerick, I sin-
tence meself to three months’hard labor and ask
your Worship to kindly endorse the sintenc e.’
The sentence was endorsed.
As showing the magnificent, sweeping way
in which Horace Tozer —who goes to London as
Q. Agent-General—was wont to surmount diffi-
culties, this incident is worth recording (writes a
Bulletin correspondent). A few years ago an
influential petition, signed by certain R.C. spi-
ritual navigators, was forwarded from Rockhamp-
ton to the Home Secretary, praying for the imme-
diate liberation of a prisoner on the ground that,
through a death-bed repentance, the confessional
and other mysterious agencies, positive evidence
of the confinee’s innocence had been obtained.
Tozer apparently regarded the bulky documents
as explosives to be handled with care ; anyhow
he promptly pigeon-holed the petition and let
things rip. Four months later the instigator of
tie release-agitation humbly enquired if any
answer would be vouchsafed the petitioners
before the prisoner’s sentence of 20 years expired.
He received an official reply, stating that the
Home Secretary—Tozer-had submitted all the
evidence supplied to the Judge who tried the
case, and that his Honor could not find anything
to warrant a reversal of sentence'or a re-opening
of the matter. The answer nearly flabbergasted the
reverend recipient. For the Judge who tried the
case was Mr. Justice Mein, who had been safely
interred, with military honors, in Toowong ceme-
tery—just two years before the petition was drawn
up or dreamt of !

Yet another Youl yarn—according to which

to be able to diagnose from inspection of a

observation that if the owner wasn’t speedily

market.

From a recent Straits Times ■ :
On view to-day at Mr. de Silva’s in High-street a
magnificent jewel, manufactured by Mr. de Silva
to the order of Mr. Tan Khiam Hock, of the
Opium Farm, who intends it as a present for his
wife. It is a lady’s belt buckle, made of solid
22-carat gold, richly carved in a beautiful floral
design, and set with 281 diamonds. There are thirteen
gold roses, each having a diamond in the centre, and in
every one of the six petals, a large 181-carat diamond
occupying the centre of the design. The diamonds
altogether amount to 210 carats, and the value of the gold
used is $750. The total value of the jewel is $15,000.
In these days, when N.S.W. positively re-

is to make it reasonably moist, and the best thing
to do that with is the Five Crowns Scotch Whisky

otherwise known as the Real Mackay. It is a
beautifully mellow, straw-colored beverage—the.
tint of a poet’s dream. In point of age, it is a
good second to Methuselah, and the aroma of the
ripe corn is in its soul, and the breath of the, dales
where that corn grew is in the soul of the person
who drinks it. Also, to descend to common, dull
particulars, it has a pleasant flavor, and a long-
established reputation ; its purity is guaranteed by
the analyst’s report on the label; and it never
“ puts a head ” on any man.*

Dear B,—One more for M‘Cooey. Some
years ago I was in the milking-yard at our farm at
Gerringong, and a few yards from my bail as a
gt one wall. (Nearly all the “ fences ”in the South
Coast are stone walls—splendid breeding-grounds
f o r snakes.) I was about to turn out my cow after
milking, when I noticed a 4ft. black snake coming
o ut of the wall, but before I could move a hand
there was a “ whish ” past my ear, and a laughing-
jackass had gripped the snake behind the head,
given it a “ thwack ” on the stones, and started
off to the nearest tree. The snake twisted itself
completely round the body of the bird, beginning
a fc the neck, but all the time “ Jack ” was ham-
mering the snake’s head against the tree. Pre-
sently the snake uncoiled, and no sooner did it
hang down full length than the bird let it drop,
followed like lightning, picked the snake up again,
an( j repeated the performance over and over for full
half-an-hour, by which time the snake was appar-
ently dead. Then “ Jack ” began to gulp it down
slowly, head-first, and when I last saw him sitting
there, some two hours after, he had 6in. of reptile
hanging from his beak.—J. Black, Nubba.

they’re ratty ’cause they are openin’ theirs. Gawd !
to think a man’s off his napper ’cause he’s sick of

all I could get out of him—except the compliment
that I was no doubt one of ’em myself.—P.

A wail from wayback :
Ed. Bulletin.- .Tint a line or two to let you know how
the shearers in the country districts gull the business
people. They go down the rivers and get their cheques,
and travel on them as far as they can. People won’t cash
them when they are on banks other than those in the
town they live in. They put up at the hotels, get meals
and horse-feed, and clear off before the hotel-keeper is
up, taking towels, combs, and very often blankets with
them. Two staved at my hotel on Wednesday night;
tea, horses fed, and eight drinks ; then sneaked their
horses out of the stable, got on them, and told me to go
to hell for payment. I gave them in charge, and they
were fined £1 each in the morning. I came here a
stranger, and my landlord told me when 1 was taking the
house to wait until the shearers came back and I would
do a good business. I have waited, to my sorrow'.—S.M.,

the former is Anndo-
petalum Biylandu/o-
sum and it doesn’t go
back on it. But there
is another sweet plant
known as the “ fagns ”
(fayus ff-unnii), which
doesn’t flourish below
the snow - line. It
sheds its leaves in au-
tumn, and a patch of
it looks like a field of
gold at a distance, but
on closer inspection
gives one the idea of
a gooseberry garden.
Though thornless, it is about eleven de-
grees more caressing than a gooseberry-
bush—and tougher, and thicker, and uglier,
and less useful, and more accursed. You
can’t cut it, unless you can find the main
stem, and you can’t find that under half-
an-hour, with a frightful waste of language.
If you walk over it you lose your boots,
and if you crawl under it you part your
hide. A surveyor told the present scribe
that it took his party of four men and the cook
a long day to cut eight chains through a fagus
gully.

S.O’B. : “On the Palmer River, when
boots ran from £>2 a pair for ‘ cossacks ’ to =£3 10s.
for Wellingtons, leather, tools and grindery were
impossibilities ; so the diggers did not wait for
their boots to wear out, but protected them in
time. They cut out a piece of greenhide that would
overlap the sole and heel of the boot by an inch or
two and pierced it all round with a knife, and
then laced it across the upper and around the heel
with strips of the same material. Cheap, effica-
cious and easy to renew.”

A “little stranger” had arrived at the

course the station youngsters were all agog to see
it. Tea-time found the household assembled ; the
children just returned from the camp. “Well,”
said squatter M'-Misery, “did ye see the pican-
niny ? ” “ ’Taint a picanniny at all, father,” said
young Jack, “ it’s a white baby, just as white as
little Willie,” pointing to the youngest of the

M'Misery hereupon began to look a bit uncomfort-

THE FISHER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
ALL night a noise of leaping fish
Went round the bay,
And up and down the shallow sands
Sang waters at their play.
The mangroves drooped on salty creeks,
And through the dark,
Making a pale patch in the deep,
Gleamed, as it swam, a shark.
In streaks and twists of sudden fire
Among the reeds
The bream went by, and where they passed
The bubbles shone like beads.
All night the full deep drinking-song
Of Nature stirred,
And nought beside, save leaping fish
And some forlorn night-bird.
No lost wind wandered down the hills
To tell of wide,
Wild waterways; on velvet moved
The silky, sucking tide.
Deep down there sloped in shadowy mass
A giant hill,
And midway, mirrored in the tide,
The stars burned large and still.
The fisher, dreaming on the rocks,
Heard Nature say
Strange, secret things that no one hears
Upon the beaten way;
And whisperings and wonder stirred,
And hopes and fears,
And sadness touched his heart, and filled
His eyes with star-stained tears:
And so, thrilled through with joy and love
And sweet distress,
He stood entranced, enchained by her
Full-breasted lovliness.

“SURPLUS."
The term “surplus ” is applied, in life insurance
affairs, to the balance, ascertained periodically,
between the assets and the liabilities. Out of this
balance or surplus, distributions of profits are
made to the policy-holders entitled to participate.
The natural tendency of distribution is to diminish
the surplus for the moment; but in the case of a
prosperous company, the decrease is speedily more
than covered by accessions of profit from various
sources. It is clear, however, that the more
liberal the periodical distributions of profits, .the
more gradual will be the growth of the surplus.
Conversely, if a life insurance company withho ds
from its policy-holders the full benefit of t.he;pro-
portion of profits immediately available, and
prefers to accumulate in the interest of future
participants, it follows that the surplus will in-
crease more rapidly in proportion. Of course it
is easy to keep in hand more than the future will
require under any possible circumstances ; and,
when that course is followed, injustice to present
participants is inevitable.
Now, The Mutual Life of New York, while
careful to make abundant reserves for future
bonuses, has always been equally careful to dis-
tribute to its policy-holders the full immediate
benefits which they are entitled to claim. The
Company has never sacrificed the interests of-
policy-holders entitled to immediate participation,
to the formation of an imposing but. empirical
surplus, never likely to be required even in the
remotest future. The surplus shown by’ The
Mutual Life at the end of 1896 was .£6,105,444.
It is a steadily increasing surplus, which, need-
less to say, is more than ample for all the
demands for which it has been created.
But, supposing the Company had, throughout
its history, acted on the principle which
has been adopted in, at least, one prominent
instance —of reserving a large proportion of the
surplus at every distribution, and, in addition,
reducing the surrender-values allowed for discon-
tinued policies, what does the reader suppose
would have been the amount of The Mutual’s
surplus in 1896? Not six millions, but upwards of
04 millions sterling I This is not guesswork. The
figures are based upon the official report issued by
the Insurance Department of the State of New
York, which gives annually the exact record of
every company doing business in that State.
Since its organisation, The Mutual Life has paid
in bonuses and surrender values to its policy-holders
<£44,445,244, which is more than twice the amount
paid for similar items by the next largest company.
Observe, then, what a magnificent surplus Thk
Mutual could have exhibited to-day, had an
illiberal policy been pursued in relation to the
assured —a surplus exceeding that of any other
office by more than 150 per cent. But, fortunately,
the Company preferred to sacrifice a mere useless
and vainglorious display to the solid interests of
the policy-holders. Who shall say that, in taking
thiscourse, the Mutual Life of New York has
not chosen the better part? and that, in so doing,
it has not well earned the high reputation which
it has attained in every part of the world as “ the
Policy-holders’ C 0.,”“ the Co. which does the most
good ? ” The intelligent reader will not allow him-
self to be misled by the parading of sums of no
use to the present generation, and in excess of
any possible needs of the generations to come.*

The Woman at Home maunders ecstatically about
Melba and her “ gilded cage,” with the gold and salmon-
pink and lime-green, and the “ wondrous sofas and
fauteuils,” and the photograph signed “ Eddy,” in which
inscription “ you recognise with a sigh the writing of
that gracious prince,” the late Cuffs-and-Collars —with a
vast quantity more of similar gentle slush, amongst which
the only notable point is the eagerness_ with which Melba
grabbed the chance of inferring that it was all very well
for her elders, poor things, to coddle and cosset their
vocal organs. “My voice is young ;it takes care of itself.
I eat, drink, and talk at all sorts of times. Nothing I
could name influences its quality." Just bo—but “ wait
till she comes to forty year.”
The Soldene is as kitteny as ever in her remarks about
her fellow-mummers. The about-to-be-imported Durward
Lely, according to the massive Emily, was her own par-
ticular tenor—“ Long, and lean, and thin in the flanks.”
What an observant lady !
A private letter from London, from a lady, contains the
following comments on the first night of “ Peter the
Great,” at the Lyceum : —“ ‘Peter the Great’ is full of
horrors, and quite inartistic. There are bits which have
dramatic promise; but why did Irving go in for such
horrors ? There isn’t much greatness about his Peter. It
is brutally small. He might be some common assassin—
raving, wild-haired, and spidery. Not a touch of the
powerful barbarian looking forward to civilisation.
Russians will be furious. . . . Lady Irving flounced into
a box, and made herself most conspicuous with other
emartl.v-dressed ladies. Ellen Terry’s part is utterly com-
monplace and untrue. She did what she could with it,
but it was low farce all the same. Several ladies fainted
at the horrors, and had to be whisked out. A , whom
we smile at for being so conciliatory, boldly said she had
never seen such bosh, and would keep on repeating it on
the stage afterwards. Mr. L said, ‘ You must own
the acting was worse than the play.’ I hardly heard any-
one who had the audacity to pay compliments, although
there were heaps of Nice people on the stage afterwards.”
Dear Bulletin.— Whatever truth may be in Clement
Scott’s opinion of stage-morals, it is certain that the world
has more leniency’for a slip from virtue in the case of a
great artist. If a great singer or actress should have a
little accident, she becomes merely the more interesting
and popular, whereas a poor little devil of a chorus-girl,
bought with a few trinkets, would earn only the foulest
of reputa'ions. A diva’s intrigue with a prince or a mil-
lionaire is glozed over as an amiable aberration of genius.
We allow privileges to the exceptional that we deny to
the commonplace, just as we call the drunken gentleman
a jolly fellow, and the drunken laborer a degraded sot.
But. there is one comfort for the cynic. We all go the
same road, and, in the end, the impartial worm is the
arbiter and critic. —G.B.
Haresfoot: “The ‘National Biography’ article on
the great Mrs. Siddons, mentions a thing I never heard
of before. In her lifetime, a fencing-master’s wife got hold
of a batch of Mrs. Siddons’s love-letters to the fencing-
master, a man of the most ordinary station, and published
them in a book. The ‘National’ biographist says there
is no thought of charging Mrs. Siddons with anything
more than making a dreadful fool of herself. All the
grand dames of the stage appear to have their weak heel.
Mrs.. Langtry gleefully pitched on a mare’s-nest about
Mary Anderson. If you know anything about a prim
actress, you are sure to know the joint of her armor, a
laughable she-Quixotic affair with some ugly little supe.
or fiddler. This is a stage corollary. The present writer
once was let into the secret of the most charming woman
he ever saw, by her mistake in enclosing, in an envelope
addressed to him, a photo, and letter intended for her
god, by universal consent the ugliest and hardest-natured
little wretch in the whole theatrical profession. What
did this scribe do?—but that is another story.”
John Edwards the younger was a well-known lawyer in
earlier Melbourne, and a very popular man. George
Fawcett (Rowe), who was running the Princess Theatre in
’62, produced a sketch called “ The Waxworks,” in which,
among other notables, he burlesqued Edwards. This riled
the lawyer so that he rushed round behind the scenes.
The curtain was rung down. Fawcett dodged around,
and so led Edwards on to the stage ; then, at a signal, up
went the curtain. There stood Edwards, foaming, while
from the wings Fawcett warbled :
“ John Edwards the younger, a very good sort,
Who defends all the boozers in Collingwood Court."
The end was peace.
During the first rush to Back Creek (Vic.) there came
along a company of theatrical “hadbeens.” The star
was a Miss St. Clair, with a voice that had been buried
and dug up again to serve the new generation. At the
first and only performance, the lady essayed a song com-
mencing with “ 0 Charming May,” but every time she let
this out, with a screech that went right up’ to the ridge-
pole of the tent, a big man brought it down, and sat on
it, with a deep bass “Oh ! my God ! ” Then everybody
rushed out for a drink, and never went back.
It was down South that a certain comedian put up the
record in the matter of pay. He was engaged at seven
pounds a week, and had to utter only one word in the
piece, and that was a name. One night when he came on
the stage his articulation was so tangled that he was
scarcely able to utter the word. Prompt sack. Seven
pounds for one word !
When Antoinette Sterling was in Sydney she gave such
an untraditional rendering of an oratorio aria that city-
organist Wiegand became quite indignant. “You do not
sing ze musique,” he expostulated, whereupon Antoinette
sweetly replied, “ I sing it as the Lord taught me.”
“ Umph 1 ” commented Weigand, with strong nasal
emphasis, “I did not know ze Lord was such a bad
musician. ”
Holdar M. : “It was at a morning rehearsal, several
years ago, and the parts were sustained by a stage-
manager, the village villain, the sweet-souled heroine,
and a scribe on the staff of a small feeble weekly. The
scribe was then more-or-less engaged to the heroine.
The she-actor was being directed how to skilfully avoid
landing the villain one on the ear with a heavy weapon,
but she made a mistake, and, instead of glancing off
the shoulder, the stick landed the footlight-fiend a
tremendous welt on the ear, badly injuring that organ.
The stage-manager’s language was unpublishable, though
perhaps excusable, under the conditions. The paper-man
expostulated about the language aimed at his girl, but his
position was uncertain and his voice unheeded. The
only result was that he ceased to give it a name at
that manager’s expense. As already mentioned, it hap-
pened a considerable time back, but the erstwhile
manager now plays leading parts, and the scribe, having
risen in the world, criticises him severely in a rather
influential paper. Thus does r-revenge come to the man
who knows how to wait.
Wizard Morritt put people in mind of another wizard,
Jacobs, familiar here at Coppin’s Olympic, the Iron Pot,
over 40 years ago. Some time after hia Melbourne appear-
ance Jacobs was showing at Scarborough. He made an
omelette in a gentleman’s hat, singed the hat badly and
covered it with grease, and flatly refused to pay for the
wreok. The gent summoned him in the police-court.
There the dirty hat was produced, and shocked the
Bench. The wizard took it in hand and said there was
nothing' the matter with it, at which a roar of disgust
arose. Then he handed the belltopperback to the Bench,
quite restored. It was only a deep-laid scheme of advt.
Viator: “In Australia one is always encountering
Augustus Glover, as a Triton amid the minnows, with a
cart of Thespis going round for bush education. Looking-
for somewhat else, I dropped to-day in a London news-
paper on his d6but in that city, just upon 30 years ago, as
Col. Briton in the ‘Wonder’ at the Princess’s. At that
time Irving was acting Bob Gassitt, a minor part in
‘ Dearer Than Life,’ with Toole, L. Brough, and Wynd-
ham. He was three years short of ‘ The Bells.’ A Clement
Scott or Archer of the era, asked to pick the comini; man,
would mass a batch of Glovers and Irvings. Frank Cates,
as a fashionable amateur, was just then working up for
his ‘Hamlet,’ in which his subordinates included Beer-
bohm Tree and Herbert Flemming.”
Dear Bulletin, —My faith in your critical acumen is
for ever shattered. You have permitted a correspondent
to ca-11 Henry Lee a “dreary egotist ” ! Granted that his
opening address to an audience smacked of the “ Je suis,”
was it not condonable in a man who, in the course of 20
minutes, lost his identity in twice as many famous per-
sonalities? And granted that there were intervals (none
too long for the perfect effaceinent of each preceding
character), were they not justified by results? Bismarck,
Dickens, Pope Leo, Kipling, identities as asunder as the
poles, pourtrayed by one man ! And the pictures were
photographic. Lee was not a “ lightning-change artist ”
—your paragraphist’s soul does not soar above the variety
halls—he was something more, something vastly more ; an
artist who gave us famous men each “ in his habit, as he
lived,” who brought us in touch with other worlds and
beings of a wider growth. He was practically a failiire,
of course, and a paragraph like that to which I take ex-
ception explains the reason. He didn’t do a “trick”
change, therefore he was “dreary.” He should have
appeared as George Reid-and changed his coat in sight
of the audience.—B.E. [The Bulletin— and, it believes,
the public—thought Mr. Lee very dull and unconvincing
save in a couple of characters. —Ed. B.]
Consider the murdered Terriss as a “ rolling stone.” At
14 joined the navy as a middy ; at 17 came into some
money, left the navy, went to India and started as a tea-
planter ; got tired of this, started home again and was
shipwrecked on the way, all hands suffering great priva-
tions. Next became apprentice to a firm of- engineers,
tired of this quickly, took a super’s billet at the Prince of
Wales’ Theatre, Birmingham, 15s. a week. Drifting to
London was introduced to Mrs. Bancroft, who gave him
a small part. Shortly after went to the Falkland Islands
sheep farming, didn’t like it, started home again, and the
ship was lost in a gale off Gibraltar. After two days’
exposure in an open boat was picked up by a passing
steamer. Next got an engagement from F. B. Chatterton
to play Malcolm Graeme in “ Lady of the Lake ” at Drury
Lane. Went to Kentucky, U.S., as a horse-breeder, soon
dropped it, returned to England in ’72, took the stage-
name of William Terriss, and found his cue at last. Born
’49, name William Lewin, father a barrister, mother a
niece of Grote, the historian.
Rickards’ panto, at Melb. Opera House is advertised as
containing local allusions jerked in at great expense by
two Australian pressmen. The present writer, after a
close and careful analysis, has discovered one allusion
that may claim to be quite local. That is in reference to
a mace that was lost somewhere in early Victorian his-
tory—half an allusion per man. Is the topical allusion
business paid for by piece or the job ?
Haresfoot: “Clement Scott and Punch Burnand are
Roman Catholics. Years ago, they both wrote bitterly
against the moral condition of the London stage.”
The gentle Jap. has no flies on him. When a theatre-
manager fails to pay his co., the Chrysanthemum Govern-
ment locks up the theatre till the co. is paid.
AT THE CHURCH CONCERT.
Last night we saw' the chairman rise,
With beaming face and pleasant,
He said, “I must apologise
For some who are not present 1 ”
The audience noted not his wink—
They let that pass unheeded—
’Twas not “ the absent ones,” I think,
For whom excuse was needed.
Harsh noise from rough, uncultured throats
Is apt to sadly try one—
They grunted all their low'er notes,
And hooted every high one.
Oh, did you hear them try to sing,
And watch them stand and stare there !
You’d swear excuses he should bring
For vocalists—who were there!

has a most reviving effect, and I have got quite fond of it. —Yours faithfully, H. BRACY.

Sirs,—Please post me an amount of Kola Nut in the form prepared for taking.—F. J. WILLIAMS.
Sirs, —Please post me another bottle of your Kola Nut Tonic ; I believe it to be without an equal.
August 9, 1896. Yours, etc., F. J. WILLIAMS.

Dear Sirs, —Kindly send me another bottle of Kola Nut Tonic. It is an excellent tonic, and I
strongly recommend it to all suffering from indigestion.—Yours faithfully,

Memo, from W. M. Maclardy & Co., 82 Pitt-street, Sydney.
Dear Sirs, —I have been using your Kola Nut Tonic for a number of years, and find it a grand
appetiser. I still use it, and find when low down from the worries of business its effects are grand, it
having wonderful reviving and stimulating properties; it seems to act on Brain, Liver and Kidneys.
—Yours faithfully, W. M. MACLARDY.

“To MESSRS. FISHER & CO.
“ Gentlemen,—
“I have much pleasure in testifying to the
excellent properties of your FAMOUS KOLA
NUT TONIC. I attribute my phenomenal suc-
cess in Australia as a cyclist to the use of it. The
staying powers it possesses have been well illus-
trated in some of the races I have won, and I still
continue to drink it. —Yours, &c.,

FISHER & CO’S
Pil-Kola
(Registered),
Fisher & Co’s Tonic in Solid Form.
These Pills contain all the properties of the
famous KOLA NUT TONIC in a solid form.
The principal ingredient of these Pills is the
famous Kola Nut, to which are added valuable
medicines, which make them an invaluable remedy
for all diseases arising from Weak Nerves, Muscu-
lar Weakness, Loss of Appetite, Depression of
Spirits, Constipation, Palpitation of the Heart,
Bad Circulation, Indigestion, Dyspepsia, Flatu-
lence, Nervous Headache, Loss of Memory, En-
largement of the Liver, Kidney Diseases, Loss of
Nerve Power and Youthful Vigor, Locomotor
Ataxy, Partial Paralysis, Sciatica, Rheumatism,
Neuralgia, and Seasickness.
DIRECTIONS— One Pill three times a day
half-an-hour before taking food. Children half a
pill. For INDIGESTION, FLATULENCY,
GASTRIC TROUBLES, or CONSTIPATION,
it is better to take them after food. PRICE,
2s. 6d. PER BOX, POSTAGE FREE.
It is not claimed for Pil-Kola that it can do
what Physicians and Hospitals cannot do. Physi-
cians and Hospitals are the people and places for
those to go who wish to be cured of disease, and
the man or men who imply otherwise are frauds
and imposters, not fit to take an honorable place
in society or in the commercial community. It is
not claimed for Pil-Kola that it can make the
dead speak or repair broken limbs. Pil-Kola will
not do sensational wonders and impossibilities,
but it is claimed for Pil-Kola that it consists of
the finest Pills ever placed on the market to cure
Indigestion, cleanse and revive the Liver, clear
the Brain, and sustain and invigorate the Human
Economy. It is a wonderful Pick-me-up, and a
splendid preparation for Strengthening the Nerves
and Heart.
Cyclists, Singers, Auctioneers, and Public
Speakers swear by it.
These Pills are beautiful and pearly, and plea-
sant to take. No pink die is used, which irritates
the stomach, and does more harm than enough.
One Pill taken three times a day will keep the
system in thorough order, giving tone to the body
and beauty to the face.
One great advantage of Pil-Kola is that it can
be posted free to every part of the world, and
another advantage is that the box can be carried
in the pocket and the Pills taken regularly as
recommended.
PIL-KOLA cures Indigestion and makes you
eat. A splendid preparation for strengthening
the Nerves and Heart. PIL-KOLA revives the
Liver and Brain, and restores vigor.
To be obtained from all Chemists and Store-
keepers.

drink in the world. It has a most marvellous

many cases haying restored Inebriates to their

USE ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT.’
It is Pleasant, Cooling, Soothing, Health-Giving, Refreshing and Invigorating.
YOU CANNOT OVERSTATE ITS CREAT VALUE IN KEEPING THE BLOOD PURE AND FREE FROM DISEASE.
“AS an illustration of the beneficial effects of ENO’S ‘FRUIT
SALT,’ i have no hesitation in giving the particulars of the case of one of
my friends. SLUGGISH ACTION of the LIVER and BILIOUS HEADACHE
affected him, so he was obliged to live upon only a few articles of diet, and to be
most sparing in their use. This did nothing in effecting a cure, although persevered
in for twenty-five years, and also consulting eminent members of the faculty. By
the use of ENO’S * FRUIT SALT ’ he now ENJOYS VIGOROUS HEALTH ; he
has NEVER had a HEADACHE or CONSTIPATION since he commenced to use
it, about six months ago, and can partake of his food to the great satisfaction of
himself and friends. You may well extend its use pro bono publico. I find it makes a
VERY REFRESHING and INVIGORATING DRINK.—I remain, yours faith-
fully, J. W. Neil.” —( From the late Rev, J. W. Neil, Holy Trinity Church, North Shields.)
HEADACHE and Disordered Stomach.— “ After suffering for nearly
two and a half years from SEVERE HEADACHE and DISORDERED
STOMACH, and after trying almost everything, and spending much money, with-
out finding' any benefit, I was recommended by a friend to try ENO’S ‘ FRUIT
SALT,’ and, before I had finished one bottle I found it doing me a GREAT DEAL
of GOOD, and now I am RESTORED to MY USUAL HEALTH; and others I
know that have tried it have NOT ENJOYED such GOOD HEALTH for years.
—Yours most truly, Robert Humphreys, Post Office, Barrasford.”
The effect of ENO’S ‘FRUIT SALT’ on any DISORDERED and FEVERISH
condition is SIMPLY MARVELLOUS. It is, in fact, NATURE’S OWN REMEDY
and an UNSURPASSED ONE.
JAUTION. —Examine each Bottle , and see CAPSULE is marked ENO'S ‘FRUIT SALT.' 1

POLITICAL
POINTS
Q. Labor-leader Glassey: “ The Nelson
men are all bunglers. Our own side is equally
capable." !!!
“ God hath made man upright ; but they
have sought out many Conventions.”—“Ecclesi-
astes "up to date.
Dengue-fever came to boss Tozer’s assist-
tance when he didn’t want to meet Tomjoe Byrnes
at a Q. Cabinet meeting.
The usual burst-up has occurred on the
Vic. Labor paper, the Tocsin, resulting in the se-
cession of C. M. Prendergast, ex-Labor M.P.,
from the managership.
Purves, Q.C., when fighting for Orangeism
at Brunswick (Vic.): “No true Irishman can be
a true Australian. A true Australian is a patriot
of the Empire, and an Irishman is not.”
Andrew Petrie, M.P., was chosen leader
of the latest Q. Protectionist party. But there’s
really nothing in the gentleman but sleepiness and
good humor, and it seems likely that he will be
superseded.
Attorney-General Isaacs once told Gov.
Brassey that when Peacock ceased to laugh the
Turner Govt, would die, and people now begin to
notice that the Chief Secretary’s cacchinations are
less frequent than hitherto.
“Wully” Affleck, M.P., the dreariest of
right-thinking bores, is described on leaflets cir-
culating out Yass way as the only honest politi-
cian in N.S.W. Parliament. Political honesty
will, at this rate, soon figure as a repulsive vice.
Brisbane (Q.) Worker has taken Drake,
M.P., to its brotherly bosom again. The Worker
crowd has at last realised that half-a-loaf is better
than no bread, and will try and work with the
Opposition as far as the fiery backblockers will
permit.
Q. Labor-leader Glassey : “I have worked
in season and out of season to place the Labor-
party in a position to take over the Government
of the country.” Excellent sentiment, but
“Scotch navigation “ main strength and
awkwardness. ”
Sydney and suburbs are supposed to have
had a population at 31st Dec. of 410,300—about
300 more than last year. The N.S.W. metropolis
reached its biggest population (423,000) at the be-
ginning of ’95. Then it dropped in one year to
408,500, and it is making good the loss very slowly.
Mat Reid, ex-M.P., who will probably
knock out Tom Finney at next Toowong (Q.)
Parliamentary election, has been converted
to the idea of a combined Opposition in t”he
Assembly. Reid is the man who publicly told the
late ex-Chief Justice Lilley that he could not run
as a straight democratic Oppositionist, but must
either join the Govt, or the Labor-party.
So Wrixon and sich complain that people
won’t settle on the land. Won’t they? Just
give them the chance. Every time Q. Govt,
throws open.forest lands for settlement the coun-
try is simply-rushed by intending settlers from all
parts of Eastern Australia. For every successful
applicant there are often nine or ten disappointed
ones. Settle on the land ! Why, they’ll eat one
another to get it.
LEADERS ARE BORN, NOT MADE.
Q. Attorney-General Tom joe Byrnes may
find himself in a tight place at next general elec-
tion. It is pretty certain that Arthur Morgan,
ex-member for Warwick, is thirsting to re-enter
political life. It is equally certain that Byrnes’
seat will be his battle-ground. Groom and Morgan
—ex-Speaker and ex-Chairman of Committees—
control the only papers on the Downs that have
any influence -Toowoomba Chronicle and War-
wick Argus— and they are making a frantic effort
to resuscitate the moribund Liberal-party.
Discovered by Rockhampton (Q.) Bulle-
tin, t’other day, that the Colonial Boundaries Act
(Imperial) of ’95 prohibits the alteration of the
boundaries of any Australasian province without-
the consent of that province. This knocks the
Central and North Q. Separation movements back
by three years. The only way out is to send sur-
reptitiously Separation candidates to South Q.,
carry the constituencies (if they can !), and then
get a Separation resolution adopted by Parlia-
ment. Even then the Council would fling outany
Separatist resolution or bill.
Two of Brisbane Worker’s severest critics
and candid friends were, it is said, disappointed
applicants for A.L.F. billets—Hoolan for the
editorship of the official organ, and Wallace Nel-
son for the position of bush lecturer and organiser.
Under Hoolan the Worker would probably have
become the laughing-stock of journalistic Aus-
tralia ; and Nelson, who now edits a smart paper,
with-the indispensable assistance of a large scis-
sors, believes—if ho really believes anything—in
political rather than industrial organisation. Both
would have been the wrong men in the right
places.
The Federal Convention rejected with
scorn the proposal of Premier Turner that each
State of the Commonwealth should be allowed to
encourage its own industries by granting bounties.
So if any State wants to encourage, say, its own
coal industry, instead of offering a bonus of so
much a ton, it will have to do it the other way by
carrying the coal by rail at so much a ton less than
the present charge.
According to Sydney Catholic Press,
Cardinal Kopp wired to William the Goat that,
“The voyage of your illustrious brother to the. far
East for the protection of the Cross is consecrated
by the sinoerest blessings.” '“Consecrated Per-
son !” Consecrated Voyage ! Consecrated
Press! And “ Protection of the Cross!” As if
the “illustrious” young skite didn’t go simply
to “ Kopp ” the Land of Chow !
Leaders of Protection deriving revenue
from the Australian Star should be regularly
asked during the ensuing parliamentary cam-
paign why it is that their organ, perhaps more
than any other newspaper in Australia, lives on
journalistic and literary matter scissored out of
English and American papers. Why should Pro-
tectionists pocket 8 per cent, mainly by excluding
Australian literary work and rifling foreign ex-
changes ?
Liberty, the organ of the N.S.W. National
Ass, brays that the impending effort to reform
N.S.W. Leg. Council emanates, not from Premier
Reid and his party, but from the Labor-Socialist
corner. Judging by the Toryism of Jollyanfat’s
25-year-nominee proposal, it must, have emanated
from the Ass itself. Any Labor-member found
believing in such a reform should be prosecuted by
his constituents for obtaining .£3OO a year by
false-pretences.
It takes the unpatriotic Australian a long
time to get over his prejudice against everything
that is locally made. In Victoria a very large
proportion of the boots now sold as French and
English and American are of local manufacture,
but the fact is concealed to pander to the Austra-
lian’s yearning after imports. The authorities are
beginning to jump on this practice, but, even if it
is jumped upon with feet like two gum-trees, it
will probably flourish for a long while yet.
The Nineteenth Century re Chinese :
Wearing as they do about six times as much clothing
as natives of India, and dressing their dead in several
layers of suits, both living and dead they should prove
admirable customers for our principal industry.
The soaring ambition of Bull the Commercial !
Even the unclean corpse of the malodorous Chow
is not safe from his enterprise. He’s going to
fight the Russ over the right to stick up on his
sign-board : “ Clothier-in-chief to the Oriental
Cadaver! ”
The Turner Ministry is the first Vic. Go-
vernment whose members have divided the money
appropriated for Ministers’salaries equally amongst
them. Turner himself is the only man in the
team who gets more than any other Minister. He
draws .£1200; all the others get .£lOOO each.
Usually the Attorney-General and one or two
others get bigger sums than the “junior Minis-
ters.” Possibly the equality of screw is the real
cause of the singular harmony that has prevailed
in the Turner Cabinet.
If the Vic. Government can effectively
irrigate the mallee country and make it decently
habitable, there is lots of room in front of it for a
big experiment. For instance, the county of
Weeab, in North-western Vic., spreads over 4004
square miles. In ISBI the population of Weeah
county numbered 4, and in 1891 it had increased
to 14. If there had been one decent-sized dog-
fight across the county border just before the
census was taken, the whole population might
easily have stepped across to see it and left Weeah
county absolutely empty. r l here isn’t a pub. and
often not a single boiled shirt in all Weeah county.
The next worst ease is Millevva county, of 3572
square miles - population, IG7 in 1881, and 172
in 1891.
Re the suggested withdrawal of free rail-
way-passes from M’sP. on the dissolution of the
Assembly. A N.S.W. Minister explains that he
is opposed to the idea in practice because members
would, if they could not travel free in preparation
for the general-election vote, use tip the whole of
the last session talking in the House to their con-
stituents. In other words, they would convert the
last session into an electioneering campaign, trust-
ing to the facilities offered by the Postal and Govt.
Printing Offices to bring them into intimate con-
tact with their people. The knowledge that they
can run about as they like aft'-r a dissolution saves
the last session of every Parliament from being
openly (even now it is covertly) turned into a
hustings.
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER .
CALLER : " I shouldn't have such a pretty maid
where my husband was about."
HOSTESS: “ Well, you know, I like to see what my
husband is up to.”
The most luckless proviso in the Federal
Bill is that which declares that there can be no
Federation unless N.S. W. comes in. In case of a
deadlock, the other provinces could otherwise
start by themselves, and trust that N.S.VV. and
Queensland would come in later on. As matters
stand, these three dreary provincialists, Reid,
Lyne and M'Millan, settle things by the one
argument—-unless the other provinces give way,
N.S. W. will retire, and over goes the show.
There is going to be a large increase in the
number of N.S. VV. factories next year as an
evidence of the blessings of Freetrade—if the
most vociferous counting can do it. As an ex-
ample of how they do things now an attempt was
made last week to force Sydney Lyceum Theatre to
register as a factory on the familar ground that
“ four or more hands were employed.” Also, the
familiar threat of prosecution if the place wasn’t
registered was dumped down at the front door,
and a huge return was left to be filled up.
Gairns (N.Q.) Post item :
The Kanaka leper, who is still “ isolated ” in the police-
court. yard, is a pitiable object. The Government will
neither release nor confine him, and he spends his time in
solilude in the police-court stables. He has several times
begged the police to shoot him, and put him out of his
misery. The Government seems to be quite callous over
the matter, and nothing seems to impress on them the
necessity of either isolating or releasing him.
But obviously the Ministry is holding the leper in
reserve as Govt, candidate for Cairns at the gene-
ral election, subsequently elevating him to Cabinet
rank with the others. Where can Cairns find a
better representative?
The blessed absence of Brunker has done
a lot to brighten up the third Federal Convention.
There is no more fire or enthusiasm in Brunker
than there is in a directory, yet the poor old man
felt called upon every now and then to give way
to a burst of flowing rhetoric about the national
destiny or something. And the flow of poor
Brunker’s poetry was just the same as a large iron
safe flowing upstairs—it was just as easy and it
bumped just the same way while getting round
the corners. Dear old Brunker was just starting
for the Convention some days ago, but Premier
Reid wired him to stay in Sydney and keep on
governing the country.
During the second last heat-wave at Ade-
laide a valuable collection of Indian birds at the
local Zoo perished to the last fowl from apoplexy,
and a rare Indian monkey did likewise. These
specimens could live in India and couldn’t in Ade-
laide. Yet the white Australian went about and
earned his living as usual. From this it would
seem that, when the dreadful Fatman wants to
import coolies to labor in North Australia on the
ground that the white man can’t stand the climate,
he is moaning through his hat. If the Indian
monkey is anything like a criterion of the heat-
bearing capacity of the Indian brown human,
then the Australian can outlast both of them.
That great tactician, N.S.W. Premier
Reid, is clearly “ the chap to save the country,”
especially when a general election looms large.
He has just wired from Melbourne to papa
Brunker: —
I rejoice that N.S.W. has had such a magnificent fall of
rain, but deeply regret to hear this morning of the heavy
damage done in various parts of the country. Settlers
reduced to absolute want by the floods should be looked
to at once. Arrangements must be made to replace all
necessary bridges destroyed, and to repair any damage
to roads interfering with traffic.
To which Brunker replies, promising best atten-
tion, and gives a copy of Reid’s wire to the
reporters. Reid, P.C. —particularly cute!

The relative
importance to the
casual Australian
cuss of Cricket and
Federation is well
exemplified by the
press prominence
given respectively
to the two subjects. In a recent Bendigo
Advertiser, for instance, while the fourth
“test” gets a top-page 3in. caption and all
but two columns of eloquence, the Convention
proceedings have to be content with about
one-fifth of the space, under an unpretentious
mid-colUmn two-line heading. Well, and what’s
the ‘ ‘ pendent world ” after all but a ball ?
Higgins, of Victoria, wanted a clause
inserted in the Federal Constitution prohibit-
ing any “ interference with the free exercise
of religion,” but a wiser majority rejected
the idea. Considering how many horrors, from
burial-alive and mutilation down to-hard dry
buns and the habit of all drinking out of the
same communion cup, form part of various creeds,
to guarantee absolute freedom to every kind of
piety to rage promiscuously in Australia would be
a very large order.
One of Boss Tozer’s political bombshells pt
his Gympie oration was that Premier Nelson will
stick to his billet till prorogation, and will seek
re-election for the Assembly. This apparently
extinguishes the idea of the retirement of Bully
Palmer from the Council Presidency, and Nelson’s
installation therein. Don’t you believe it! Nelson
will stay on as Premier to the season’s end, because
his seat is pretty safe. But if he found his chances
getting “dingo fever,” then “ up goes the don-
key ’’ —into the Council as often aforesaid.
‘‘ Thrift ” has given place to “ Trust ” as
the shibboleth of Fatman in Melbourne since
this Convention began incubating, and now when
the man of lard wants anything, or doesn’t want
anything, he whoops for “ Trust ” :
Upon the wall, above the place
Where sits alone
The cloaked Speaker, grave of face* ,
When, on his throne,
A placard h mg, and let it be
In letters red, , ..
Then all the delegates may see

The Victorian Government reckons that it
has suddenly discovered something that has been
staring it in the face for any number of years. It
has dropped to the fact that the Murray at
Tooleybuc is 190 feet above sea-level, and that the
huge depression known as Lake Tyrrell is 50 feet
lower. Therefore, if a channel is cut through the
country—almost entirely plain—between the two
places, the Murray, in flood times, will fill Lake
Tyrrell without any worry or expense, and leave
70 square miles of deep water available for irriga-
tion. The levels, it is alleged, were taken long
ago, but it never having occurred to anybody
that water would as soon flow downhill as not, the
relevance of the facts wasn’t noticed.
Writes E.D. :
Higgins, member for Geelong, is putting in a solid
foundation for his political career as a member of the
Federal Convention. Higgins has shown himself the
most strenuous, most resourceful, and gamest democrat
of them all. He has fought many losing fights, and one
or two utterly hopeless ones, but he saw clearly, where
Turner and other alleged democrats peered feebly
through the smoke, and he struck like a man who had
convictions and honored them, whilst his political chief
doddered round, hobbled by his K.C.M.G.-ship, and clat-
tering his other Imperial tinware. Victorian hopefuls
begin to look anxiously to the Geelongite over the heads
of Turner and Peacock, and even Isaacs. It is our tragedy
that we soon cease to expect much from the men who are
up top within reach of the baubles, the fruit of the Royal
Oak. Strange that sleepy, rich, respectable Geelong
should turn out so many fighting radicals—it must he the
reaction.

Some three months ago the Chilian ship Ata-
cama put into Sydney harbor leaky and unsea-
yicorthy. It is reported that she was sold for
£7OO ; “ repaired ” for £lOOO ; and she was
then sent to Newcastle to load coal. The
Atacamsf is stated to be a wooden vessel of
1572 tons register; and even a soft-wood vessel
can hardly be built under £5 per ton of regis-
tered tonnage : a teak or oak ship may cost
anything up to £2O, or even more. And the
Atacama was sold for seven hundred pounds I
A full-rigged ship for £7OO ! less than 10s.
per ton ! It is true she was, according to
the insurance list, twenty - three years old 1
At Newcastle, a captain and crew were
shipped ; 1778 tons of insured coal were
put aboard; and, on January 29, the vessel
sailed for California. She had not been out
a week when she started leaking. The
captain’s log tells the rest of the story. The
weather was no more than moderate ; the sea
was high, but not very exceptionally high. Yet,
though the pumps were continually going, the
water continually increased. The vessel ap-
parently couldn’t stand the weight of the
cargo ; she seems to have been opening her old
leaks all over; and on February 6, at
540 miles from Sydney, the captain wore ship
and made for port. Doubtless beating against
the westerly winds strained the vessel still
more ; but apparently the captain had to choose
between that and foundering in mid-Pacific. On
Feb. 9 the 23-year-old, £7OO-ship had water
over the coals fore and aft, and captain and
crew took to the boats. Then, and then only,
did they meet with heavy weather. The cap-
tain’s boat, a 24ft. life-boat, was capsized and
all stores lost; but she was righted again, and
on Feb. 16 was picked up by a tug near Sydney,
after the occupants had suffered extraordinarv
privations, and one lad had been drowned. The
other two boats—not life-boats—with 12 men
aboard, have not been heard of up to time of
writing. Probably they never will be heard of.
The Bulletin wants to know what authority,
Marine Board or other, permitted this £7OO
ship to leave Newcastle in such a condition
that she opened up like a sieve in moderate
weather, and—in all probability drowned
two-thirds of her miserable crew ? There
must surely be some authority responsible.
Or, if there was no responsibility—if the Ata-
cama was a perfectly sound ship, and it is sim-
ply the nature of a sound ship to go
down in moderate weather a few days out
from port that point ought to be made clear.
The Bulletin calls upon N.S.VV. Govt, to
move in the matter at once, and to see that no
evidence is suppressed, no facts are hushed-up,
but that the blame for those drowned sailors
if blame there really be—is fixed on the
shoulders of the responsible persons.
For on land and on sea Fate’s arrows fall,
And landsmen have many bewailers.
God ? He is busy watching His sparrows fall—
The devil may take the sailors!

When Grady, the bogus “ guessing ’’-com-
petition -person, came before Sydney Quarter
Sessions Court, the jury promptly “ guessed ” that
Mr. Grady ought to go to gaol. Grady told the
arresting detective that “ between what you get
and what you expect to get there's a wide differ-
ence.”
Edwin Suttor, perhaps the last of the old
Bathurst pioneers, died the other day at Peel,
N.S.W., aged 80 years. His father, George
Suttor, was a free emigrant early in the century,
and settled at Balkham Hills, near Parramatta.
In 1822 he sent his eldest son, then a lad, with a
party to settle on the Plains. The lad was fol-
lowed by his brothers as they grew up. Of them
the recently-deceased Edwin was the youngest.
The “purification” of Victorian suburban
electoral-rolls recently has drawn further attention
to the fact that in these days a prodigious number
of Melbourne men live in their wives’ houses.
The department instructed its inspectors to object
to such men’s names remaining on the “proper-
tied” list; but magistrates have called for the
rate-receipts, and when the latter have been in
the husbands’ names the bench has winked and
dismissed the objection.
Premier Turner, of Victoria, being appar-
ently of sound mind and body, and not drunk,
nor winking at anybody, proposed last week that
the Federal Government should guarantee to pay
each province as much customs revenue as it gets
now—this despite the abolition of interprovincial
duties, and should borrow the money if need be.
Which is probably the first result of David Syme’s
constant girding at Turner because he doesn’t
borrow money and “go it.” Turner is trying to
go it, and doesn’t know how.
The Victorian law authorises divorce on
the ground of habitual drunkenness, but the diffi-
culty of defining what is habitual drunkenness has
led to much trouble. A few days ago, however,
a Bendigo woman asked for separation on the
ground that the old man had only been sober
three days since 1892. And as he wandered into
court just then in a beery and amorous condition,
and wanted to hug his wife right under the eye of
the law, it was decided that he was habitually
drunk within the meaning of the Act.
Norddeutscher Lloyd’s Kaiser Wilhelm der

is all but one-eighth of a mile long, by 66ft. beam,
and 71ft. high from keel to sun-deck (four-storey

from 14 boilers holding 2000 tons of water and re-
quiring a daily consumption of 500 tons of coal.
The twin-screws are 23ft. dia., on shafts 6ft. in
circumference. There are 66 : auxiliary engines,
and the full complement of souls would be 2000—
1440 passengers and 460 crew. The water-tight
compartments can be closed in 15sec. ; the pump-
ing-out power is 1,000,000 gallons per hour.
Yet this enormous mass was rushed along, on her
record trip, an average 600 miles per 24 hours.

We are the largest and most experienced cycle-
manufacturers represented by a direct branch in Aus-
tralia ; therefore, we can make it very interesting for
agents and riders. Direct supply (no dealers’ and
importers’ profits to pay) makes it possible for us to
giye the best value in Australia.
Examine our new RED BIRD, RUBY RIM, and
BLACK BIRD Cycles for yourself. They will speak
for themselves. Prices—£26 10s., £2l, £i6 10s.
An agent is known by the wheel he sells, therefore
it will pay you to secure the acknowledged peer of all
—“the wheel of high degree.”
There is gold in the “ Red Bird” both for agents
and riders.
Gold ! Gold ! Gold ! Gold !
Molten, graven, hammered and rolled,
Bright and yellow, hard and cold,
Hard to get and heavy to hold.
Nickel steel is the strongest, toughest, and most
endurable material of its kind yet discovered.
“ Red Bird ” frames are constructed of nickel steel.
Every “ Red Bird ” has improvements of its own to
make it valuable to riders. The result speaks for itself.
There are a few people who still insist, in spite of
our successes, that all wheels are alike, and that our
wheel is not very different from others. But —they
have never ridden the “ Red Bird.”
The secret tempering process which all “ Red Bird ”
frames undergo makes our wheel the strongest on
earth. You can’t break our frames with a club.
A perfect bearing-chain is the Wilson chain, used
on all our wheels. Radically different in construction
from any other chain in use, possessing the only prac-
tical hardened rivets—in itself a positive proof against
wear—cut absolutely perfect in pitch, it stands un-
rivalled to-day among the bicycle-chains of the world.
The Wilson chain is one of the many features that
have made our bicycles celebrated for their easy
running qualities and general excellence.
The difference between the Red Bird cycle and
other makes is that on the former it seems like run-
ning down hill all the time.
Tiie strength of the “Red Bird” cycles is pro-
verbial. Their nickel steel frames have made their
name celebrated the world over, and they have been
styled by riders and mechanical experts as the “ solid ”
Red Bird.

SPOUTING NOTIONS.
Ihe Australian Cup, run next Tuesday, is quite
jikely to result in a “ surprise”—Luster, for instance, or
Majestic, or La Carabine, or Manfred. On the ottier
hand, Aurum is likely to win, and of the two probabilities,
a victory for the favorite or a “ turn-up,” The Bulletin
will predict the former. Next to Aurum, the most tempt-
ing chances are Mischief, Amberite, Battalion, Parisienne,
Cravat, and Luster. At time of writing, the Australian
Cup is really a more open event than the Newmarket
Handicap, but only one horse can win it. If Aurum
carries the St. Albans’ money, he will surely be prominent
at the business end of the journey.
* * '* •
Tbe fact that three or four Victorian stables are
in great “form” will arouse a deal of slumbering local
interest in the V.R.C. autumn meeting, which starts next
Saturday (26th). Since The Bulletin said of Resolute,
“ the trouble will he to guess exactly how good he is,”
the big hay horse has won another big stake, and it now
looks as though he ought to win the Newmarket Handi-
cap for Mr. W. R. Wilson. Anyhow, Resolute is a
most attractive place investment. Two Saturdays in
succession he has come with a brilliant run at
the finish of a sprinting race, and his latest win
was a strong Newmarket tip. Resolute got a bad
start in the Oakleigh Plate at Caulfield, but although
the distance was half a furlong less than he will
have to go in the Newmarket, he managed to catch the
leaders in time to win by a length and a half. A remark-
able achievement under the circs. Weight, within
reasonable limits, is not a matter of much moment to an
animal of Resolute’s stamp in a six-furlong race, and if he
keeps his pecker up during the current week—well, what
is to beat him ? The present writer prefers Resolute to
Bundook, The Parisienne, Amiable, Mischief, Olaf, For-
tunio, and Amberite. His old-time fancy for Wait-a-Bit
is not as strong as it was. The Ballarat horse has a ten-
dency to shut up when pinched.

E. M. Brennan, lessee of the Hobart Clip
winner, Rosed la, is a “ tall and freckled and sandy” in-
dividual with Celtic cheekbones and lots of luck. He it
was who rooted out the 4130 z. nugget on a Westralian
field, and tramped 121 miles to Southern Cross with the
lump of wealth in his water-bag. He has struck it lucky
on most modern goldfields in the world, and is now off to
Klondyke. His mare paid £25 for 10s. tote-tickets in the
Hobart Cup ; what Brennan thought of her chance is in-
dicated by the fact that he had only eight tickets —£4
on the machine, and no book bets. *

Dear B. — Met a man lately who seems to be
thriving on a system of backing horses. He explains :
“ I rely on one favorite netting home each day, and I am
on that favorite. Igo out and back the favorite in the
first, say 10s. at 2 to 1 ; if it wins, I stop ; if it loses, I
double ray bet on the favorite in the next -say £1 at 6 to
4. If if wins, lam still in ; if not, double again on the
next. Very seldom have a day on which no favorite gets
home. Sometimes I don't catch till the last of six races—
10s., £l, £2, £4, 8, 416 at say 6to four : £24 to £l6. I
win £8 10s. on the day.” Looks genuine, too, because he
never offered to “ bite my lug” in return for the revela-
tion. —Sob.
Several other people have also rushed in to
draw The Bulletin s attention to this “ system,” which
seems to be epidemic just now. It is a very old affair,
anyhow. The men who have followed this scheme have
mostly given it best because—(l) Often, after a long run
of bad luck, t hey had to bet so heavily to net square that
they couldn’t get. the money on ; (2) because, after a long
run of bad luck, they had to bet so heavily that it became
worth the bookies' while to stiffen the horse ; (3) because
their system became known, and the bookies simply
refused their money on any terms when the doubling pro-
cess reached a certain point; (4) because, after a long run
of losers, they had to put on so much money to get level
that they shortened the odds against themselves to a
ruinous extent—when a man has to back so heavily that
the favorite goes to, say, 5 to 2 on, then, even if he wins,
he may easily be left a loser ; (5) because the booky isn’t
an automaton. Anyhow, if the system was any good, the
man who lives on it wouldn’t give it away. Even if one
man could live on it, a hundred couldn’t.
Taking the scheme literally, however, there
isn’t, even on the alleged inventor’s own showing, much
in it.. The punter on this system can only have one win
a day at most. Now and then he won’t have one. Say
six races a day. Say he always gets 2tol on the favorite
—which he won’t do. Say that he won on the first,
second, third, fourth, and fifth races on five consecutive
days, and the sixth day he went right through with-
out a win. Also say that he had no expenses,
was never robbed, there was no hitch at all,
his bookie always paid up, and nothing went wrong.
Then, under these reasonably favorable circumstances, he
would have a loss of £l3 10s. to show for a week’s work.
If he won three days on the first race, once on the third,
and once on the fifth, and one day had no win at all, he
would be £l7 10s. to the bad in a week. If he won
once on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth
races, in six consecutive days, and then had no win on
the seventh day, he would only be in £3. If he won
eight days on the first horse, and four days on
the second, and one day on the third, and
then had one day without a win, he would
have a loss of £l5 to show for a fortnight’s toil. There-
fore, some more weak points in the scheme are : If there
are six races a day, and the punter stops after his win,
he can only have one win per day ; though he may always
have six losses. And his biggest possible win, at a steady
2to 1 average, is £l6 10s ; his biggest possible loss is £3l
10s. So the odds are against him all the time.

Australian eleven players had great fun with
Howell when he first played in big cricket. They used to
get around him in a circle and ply him with questions
about bees and bee-keeping, all pretending to be deeply
interested ; but the big man has dropped to the game
now. The latest idea is to seek an explanation from
Noble as to how he makes the ball “ curve ” in the air.
The explanation takes something like an hour. Noble"
who has been asked the question several thousand times
now, hasn’t yet tired of demonstrating the process, but
he will drop to it by-and-bye. They call him “ Rats ”

South Australia doesn’t seem justified in build-
ing much hope now on its midget, Tommy Drew who
did big things against the Englishmen in their on’enin--
match in Adelaide. In the Sheffield shield match, in Mef-
bourne, he pottered around miserably, and blundered
t oo, in the field. With long Trumble bowling against him’
t he ball rises too high for the little fellow every time. ’
The failure of S.A. men in the second innings of
their match in Melb. gave Yic. the Six ffield shield. They
wanted only 14/ ; and, on a good wicket, they cmld not
make it against Trumble and Roche, both of whom beat
every batsman. Jarvis, who made 31, and so topped
Hill’s score, did fairly after the first 20 minutes ; during
that probationary period he didn’t know where he was, a
dozen times at least. S.A. had the worst of the lock, so
far as wicket is concerned, in l he first innings, no doubt;
but the Victorians’ fine fielding, and Trumble and Roche’s
excellent bowling, fully entitled them to their win.

Iredale’s failure in recent first-class cricket helps
to establish a rule that the cricketer who turns news-
paper scribe is doomed as badly as the boxer wh . takes
to play-acting. Ranjitsinhji has lately touched low level
probably through Striving to play cricket and do cricket-
reporting at the same time. Turner also helped to run a
short-lived sporting-sheet ere his downfall became final.
* • * •
Iredale does not go far enough for some people
in stating that he intends to ask the other selectors not
to consider his claims when the team for the final test-
match (this Saturday) is being picked. The querulous
would prefer ad. finite statement that he will not play,
for there is a feeling in some quarters that when the
names appear Iredale’s will be amongst them, although no
reasonable argument can be brought forward why he
should be selected before Mackenzie, whose figures
against the Englishmen are 80, 59, 13 ) and 52. It is an
utter mistake having active players on the selection com-
mittee. Until the crowd got nasty Garrett helped to pick
himself and other “has beens,” with the result that N.S.
Vlales was badly beaten by Victoria. So soon as
Garrett resigned a team was picked which beat
the Englishmen. With the three active players
composing the last-match selectors it is a case of “ You
scratch my back and I’ll scratch vours.” When Darling
was off-color Trott and Iredale stuck to him ; w hen Trott
was off, Darling and Iredale stood his friend ; and now
Ireffale’s turn comes a lot of people feel that the men he
has befriended will not throw him over, and that the
picking of the last test-match team will probably be on
the same lines as the first—“ the three gentlemen present
for a start.” Iredale, on his present form, should not be
in the team, even with Mackenzie out of the way as
Donnan s figures against the Englishmen read 104 29* 41
and 59. • > .

Jones staggered Melbourne by making 66 for
S.A. against Vic. He did it, too, by good play. But the
surprise isn’t justified. Jones can, or at least could bat
When he was taken down to Adelaide from Broken Hill
it was almost as much for his batting as his bow ling—he
had made up to that date the record Barrier bi<» r score
It really seems, since he established his bowling'reputa-
tion, thathe has been trying how far he can burlesque
the other branch of the game. His reply probably is that
he wants to keep the eyes of the selectors and the public
riveted on his bowling, and that he isn’t going to risk
black marks by disappointing them as a batsman. Yet
as the bowler has to bat, and as even 1 run is better than
0 any day, the idea (to which, by the wav, more than one
bowler clings) seems pretty rotten. It might be in-
teresting, though, to know how far selectors and the
public are responsible for it.

“ The race problem now confronts us in a fresh

have so taken to heart Olive Schreiner’s eleventh com-
mandment, Keep your breeds pure,’ that they shrink
from the very companionship of color in sport. Sport in

The English amateur cricketers dodged the
Brisbane (Q.) mob by getting out at Roma-street instead
?*% b KK Central. Quo’ Maclaren : “ VVe were mobbed
(and robbed) once, but—never again ! ” “ Yes, an’ you’ve
been licked three times ! ” yelled a Brisbanite.
A deep growl from Toowoomba (Q.) at Brisbane
because the cricket selection committee at the latter city
practically ignored the Toowoombavians who made the
only pretence of a stand against Stoddart’s team in Nov.
last. Thomas, of Toowoomba, made 85 against the Eng-
lish bowling, and is a cool and rising youngster. But
Brisbane has ignored him and boycotted Toowoomba.
It is maintained by many Q. cricket authorities that, if
the very best men of Brisbane, Ipswich, Toowoomba,
Wide Bay, Rockhampton, and Townsville were secured,
there would be no difficulty in finding a purely Q. team,
fit to face the Stoddart eleven with a reasonable chance
of success.

It was noticed in Melbourne that when stumper
Storer, after bowling, resumed the pads he stooped down
and stripped them off Druee. Whereupon the amateur
Adonis walked off and a brother pro. lent Storer a hand
in re-adjusting the leg guards. That’s quite Hinglish,
don’t you know.

He winning the toss, “ Mao (an Irishman)” puts
four reasonable questions : (1) “ Why are the Australians
so jubilant when they win the toss?” (2) “Why were
they so dejected in the first test-match when they lost
the toss?” (3) “Why did they lose that same game? ”
(4) “On what occasions did the Australians win test-
matches when the Englishmen batted first?” The last
question is a reminder that Stoddart’s previous team and
this one have, between them, played nine test matches
up to date, and have not, as a matter of fact, been beaten
when they batted first. They were once beaten when
Stoddart won the toss (at Sydney), but their injudicious
captain sent the Australians to the wickets on that occa-
sion.

Harry Trott, questioned as to whether he was
illegally drinking champagne and soda in a hotel t’other
Sunday, explained that he drank something which didn’t
taste stronger than soda straight. Moreover, he almost
succeeded in looking, for the moment, like a cricketer
who generally takes cold tea on Sundays.

Giffen’s book, like all other cricket chatter, is
chiefly foolish in its oxer-estimation of the “greatness”
of the game’s notable exponents. First-class players are
so many in number, and so various in their workmanship,
that no thoughtful outsider can fad lo see the littleness of
cricket itself as a science. Luck, and the natural limita-
tions to physical strength and activity in even the
strongest professors, make it practically impossible for
any batsman to achieve a wonderful and long-lived
supremacy' over his fellows. A test-match performer mav
wrinkle his brow and tell us that it “ takes a lifetime to
learn cricket,” but he can’t get over the fact that Clem.
Hill, at 20, is the most successful scorer in Australia,
and that W. G. Grace played for the Gentlemen v. Players
when he was a boy of 17. W.G. has been a foremost
batsman for 30 years, “ learning ” the game all the time ;
yet even this exceptionally able player was on the decline
before he had ceased to be a young man. Cricket is a
boy’s game, with plenty of manly virtue in it. The
simplest way of judging its scientific possibilities is to
study the heads and faces of leading cricket scientists.
How much brain-work is needed to knock up a “ cen
tury ” or accomplish the “ hat-trick?”

Jones and M‘Kibbin, and other throwers, Aus-
tralian and English, are fond of quoting a foolish request
by “ chucker” Crossland, re the complaint that he didn’t
bowl tbe ball “ Well, give me permission to throw and
see the difference.” This was no answer. Nobody sug-
gests that Jones, M‘Kibbin, and co. are full and complete
throwers. They start with a bowling action, and go
through a series of more or less misleading arm move-
ments until they get near to the crease. Then they
throw the ball. Spofforth wrote a year ag*o to London
Sporting Life his opinion that M'Kibbin’s delivery of the
ball was a chuck, not an over-arm bowl*. A chuck ham-
pered by the necessity for dissembling preliminaries.

comparisons : During the late test-match the record
speetatorate put up an aggregate of 17,426,921 hand-
claps, drank 3,872,176 drinks of various kinds, and
smoked 156,001 cigars, 1,296,732 pipes of tobacco and
19,272 packets of cigarettes. After the match 1,560,000
people said “What do you think of it?” and 1 559,976
answered “ What’d I tell you !” 200 publicans and 500
other business people said “Damn the cricket-match;”
and two dozen journalists got shilling cricket annuals and
the office back files and wrote a couple of hundred feet of
“ slosh.”

The S.A.-N.S.W. match, played at Sydney, re-
sulted in an easy win for S.A. by 295 runs—thanks mainly
to big second-innings scoring by Clem. Hill and Jarvis,
who totted up 170 and 154 respectively off their own little
bats. S.A. went in first, and scored 289; N.S.W. fol-
lowed with 310, and things looked promising ; then S A.
came with a mighty 442, and N.S.W. disconsolately
petered out for 126. In the last innings, Jones, for S.A.,
took five wickets for 62, and Evans four for 61.

Arthur M. Cary, the Boston cyclist, now tour-

method entirely new. He has actually undertaken the

in advertising ; and, awfullest shock of all, he is working
at his profession of mechanical draftsman at each place
he touches.

to brand themselves “aristocratic.” Even the Lady

George Carey, in a recent interview, brought to
mind a bit of old Sydney when referring to Ned Bitton’s
free-and-easy on the site of the Clarendon Hotel, Castle-
reagn-street (writes a Bulletin cormp mdent). Avery
sea of gore must have been spilt, in the scanty in the rood
old days when kid boxine-gloves were unknown. The
audience sat at tables and ordered drinks whilst “ Duck”
Ingram, as M.C., would introduce “Two friends, gents;
time,’ and the aspirants would take as big a hiding for
mere fame as the latter-day pug. would want a century
for. And then “ Duck ’ might invite any gent in the
audience who wanted a spar to have a go with one of the
hangers-on or triers-out who were always about the place.
For these bouts a special set of gloves was kept on the
premises, one pair of ordinary chamois-leather, and the
other with an underneath coat of greenhide as hard as a
b ick ; the soft pair, of course, being rung-in on the mug
from the audience. And then the skin and hair would fly
from the “ gent,” until the “ pro.’’ found the butt of his
ear, the “point” being then an undiscovered quantity.
Ah, me! it makes one sigh for the good old days.

It is years since two of the biggest smarties in
—say—Jerusalem had a quiet game of poker with a
moneyed “mug,” whom they took down for £5OO or so.
At the end of the game the mug handed over his cheque,
and, whilst one sharper went out to order some wine, the
innocent asked the other to give him the cards as a
memento of the game. The wine was drunk, and,
after the mug had departed, bookie No. 1 said, “ Give us
the cards, old man ; 111 lock them up.” And then it
flashed upon No. 2 that he had given their victim the
pack of marked cards with which they had taken him
down. The pair, thinking it a plant "which would put
them away at the club, early next morning called upon
the mug, and, after beating about the bush, one pulled
out the cheque, saying “ Look here, old fellow, we had no
wish to take your money—the whole thing was a joke,”
and threw the cheque on the fire. Some wine was drunk,
and, as they were going, one asked, in an offhand sort of
way, for the pack of cards they had played with. “ Well,
I’m sorry to say I can’t give them to you,” was the reply,
“ for when I got home I took an oath that they should be
the last cards I would ever handle, and I burnt them.’’
Fact!

TO THE UP-TO-DATE CRICKET REPORTER.
’Twas an easy thing reporting
In the days when games were fought in
The dim and distant ages
When the first few convicts came ;
Now the largest, weeklies claim
Some three or four big pages
For the progress of the game.
When the provinces are meeting
For a victory or beating,
Where the company most mixed is.
Are they bound to give a list
Of the batsmen long dismissed
And the bowlers of the sixties,
And the way they used to twist?
Are the dead ones, stiff and staring,
To be dug up for comparing,
To be weighed upon a steelyard
With a pen and ink to check,
Till the writer dies a wreck ?
Is that poor old Hariy Hilliard
To be dragged in by the neck?
Must you fix a greedy talon
Upon Cosstick and Frank Allan?
They could bowl and take a wicket,
But, for God’s sake, let them rest
From the Inter’ and the Test,
For they’ve given up'hig cricket,
And they know their business best.
Several score of years ago
There were men could play, I know,
But their bats have long been barren
And their bails have ceased to clinic.
And the thoughts those ancients think
In the matter of M’Laren
Are not worth the waste of ink.
Now, do not think I’m sneering,
For I don’t the least mind hearing
H >w Ranji hit a fourer,
Or the way that four was got;
But I bar this.jolJy rot
Of what Stoddart said to Storer
Or some idiot said to Trott.
Tell us all about the cricket.
And the wearing of the wicket,
And the manner of the playing;
But be sparing, if you please,
Over details such as these :
How you heard Bill Howell saying
That he saw George Gitfen sneeze !

In view of the directly-conflicting evidence,
the seaworthiness of the unfortunate brig Amy
(whose crew of eight were all lost off Bulli, N.S. W.,
lately) remains a very doubtful question, but a
general impression appears to prevail that, heavy
as the sea was, a reasonably staunch vessel would
have held together much longer. It is, anyhow,
plain that, as regards the antique argosies so largely
bought into the coasting-trade, local marine-sur-
veying wants a lot of turning-over.
There’s a weird pathos about the circum-
stance of the Amy castaways cheering the efforts
that were being made for their rescue. One
moment the faint, hopeful voices out of the
tempest—then sudden perdition, and the voice of
the storm alone. Recalls the cheering of the
out-fighting Calliope by the doomed crew of the
American war-ship at Apia.
Imitation may be the sincerest flattery,
but it is a flattery which many people would, no

sufferers from this form of deception are those who,
while wishing to obtain Scrubb’s Cloudy Am-

and water-softener, are supplied with inferior
cbunterfeits, often most deleterious, and liable to
bring on various skin troubles, more easy to ac-
quire than to get rid of. Every retail dealer
seems to sell his own preparation of ammonia, and
so the public often obtain an inferior article, a
form of fraud which can only be avoided by in-
sisting upon Scrubb’s, and no other, while it can
always be obtained from the makers by application

The inquest-jury in the terrible Fry case,
at Adelaide, were sagely of opinion that the '
slayer was “troubled in his mind,” and Sydney
S.M. Herald correspondent gravely remarks that
“it is understood his mind was affected.’’ Great
God of Bathos ! A hitherto tender and affection-
ate husband and father suddenly slaughters wife,
children, and self—and it is understood his mind
was affected. Also, this same overpowering
scribe speaks of the eldest girl's face as being
“covered with a repulsive purple blood.”
George Upward, the athletic Sergeant-at- !
Arms of Vic. Leg. Assembly, lost his brother !
John, the other week, through a railway accident
near Winchelsea. John Upward acted as an in-
spector of line repairs, and when travelling along
the rails on his tricycle he was overtaken by a
ballast train and done to death. Having been
given to understand that the train was away he
had no thought of danger, and when last seen
alive (by the guard) the poor fellow was casually
raising his hat to get a breath of wind on his head.
And then—he left a widow in delicate health and
a young family for whom the Government will
probably do “something.” Deceased, like his
brother George, was a first-class oarsman, and a
fine fellow until that unexpected ballast-train
came to pass. The irony of fate !
“Grip
Re Cohen. —Concurrent with the marked mental de-
velopment observable throughout Jewry, are attention to
diet, rigid observance of domestic regulations, and the
infinite care and solicitude in the up-bringing of children,
common to Hebrew mothers of all grades. Cause and
consequence are here not easily distinguishable. While
not ignoring modern progress, the Chosen are mainly
content to stand by Moses of the Tablets, in his secular
capacity of general level-headedness, even as the Gentiles
of to-day are to leave the Submerged Tenth to be success-
fully dealt with by Salvation Boss Booth—himself perad-
venture a ’verted fin-de-siitcle descendant of Ishmael.
Besides, the dominant brain leverage which enables
Benjamin to hold his end at about 45 from the dead
horizontal, is the indefinite social factor of the fre-
quent and undeniable loveliness of Rebecca—when young.
The latter was, probably, the latent motive of the pro-
longed detention of Israel in Egypt, the Coptic subtlety
of the Pharaohs finding the 6bject justified the means.
During the present century, in northern and eastern
Europe, there has been, from various causes, Judaic
deterioration. Brighter climate and more genial sur-
roundings are needed as in, say, Australia, where the
Tribes flourish like Moreton Bay fig-trees. If the con-
servative jealousy among Jews in English-speaking
countries as regards intermarriage with the tribe of Bull
could be modified, good all-round results might be ex-
pected. The cross of the alleged Anglo-Saxon (Celt,
Teuton, Scandinavian, and other remnants of Japheth)
with about the purest of Semitic races, might prove a
temporary substitute for Zionism. For, though the
average Briton, with his übiquitous kith and kin, openly
reviles and affects to despise the Jew, he secretly adores
and would very much like to make love to the Jewess—
when young. Moreover, Bull, with his partners, Solo-
mon, Levy, M’Moses and Co., finds the latter like the
number nine, even when disintegrated turning up in some
other form or combination. But, severally or jointly,
they don’t favor a hurried exodus to Palestine or any-
where, and are not taking any Zion stock at present.

A WELL-KNOWN MEDICAL OBSER-
VER WRITES AS FOLLOWS
“ Hundreds of lives are ruined and many homes
are rendered desolate by continued and wilful
neglect of the ordinary precaution against ill-
health.
Many people have heavy doctors’ bills to meet;
and are never free from sickness, pain and worry,
when, by just taking a commonsense view of the
matter, they will find that they will have a per-
manent and speedy cure almost at their doors,
which, while renewing the BLOOM OF HEALTH
AND VIGOR, improving the body and mind,
costs but a trifle.
: How often we see strong
men in the prime of life
suddenly
Stagger in the Street,
and, on arriving at their
homes, find that they are
in for perhaps at least a
long and painful illness,
the cause, no doubt, of
neglected disorders, which
have for sometime past
been devouring their mind
and reducing their
strength. Cases of this
kind occur daily, and an
INFALLIBLE CURE
is found in taking the
Alfaline Herbal
Remedies.
Again, we see a man
Careworn and Dissatisfied Trudging to
Business,
i
taking little interest in
topics of the day, who
cannot appreciate the
good things of this life,
who is nervous, irritable
and discontented, crotch-
ety in his office, and surly
in his home and al-
together tired of his exist-
ence. This man, suffering
as he is from LIVER and
KIDNEY TROUBLES,
goes in for a course of the
Alfaline Remedies,
and in a few days you
will hear him exclaim
that it is the BEST
REMEDY IN THE
WORLD, and his im-
proved health will be liv 7
ing evidence of the won-
derful virtues of th' Alfaline Liver and
Kidney Jt*iUs, which are sold at the small price

How invalids

presence of any
illness from
which they may
be suffering,
which keeps
them i ndoors
throughout the
year, while they
drag wearily
and painfully
throughout the
long 1 years of
their life. When
looking out into
the bright sun-
shine, they espy
some more HAPPY and FORTUNATE SISTER
or friend spinning up the drive, looking graceful
on the latest, up-to-date bike, and fresh and
blooming, full of LIFE, VIGOR, and HEALTH,
abth a merry laugh which rings throughout the
house and brings pleasure and happiness in its
wake. And ali due to the wonderful virtues
of Herr Rassmussen's Alfaline Herbal
Remedies, which have cured thousands, and
thus brought about more real hoalth and happi-
ness' than all other remedies put together.

who hears the huntsman’s horn, or the boys selling

Oies. MEET THE SAME PEOPLE after a

HOW CAMEST THOU TO BE IN THIS

YOUNG
LADIES
who possess everything
which the feminine mind
can desire —Horses, Car-
riages, Dresses; and
handsome girls with plea-
sant homes and fond
parents, who shower
every luxury upon them,
are often MELAN-
CHOLY and Fretful,
worrying over every little
disappointment or tiifle,
their complexion suffer-
ing like their tempers. Small minor matters are
magnified into serious catastrophies, and they
become trying to their friends and unbearable to
themselves.
The Alfaline Universal Pills effect a
SUDDEN and MARVELLOUS CHANCE,
and all these petty troubles vanish. Hundreds
of Testimonials are received daily from these
sufferers, as well as from the most obstinate cases.
NERVOUS AND DESPONDENT.
That man can sit in his office day after day
throughout the year and attend to the important
duties of a merchant, financier, departmental-
head, mine-manager, banker, expert, and politician,
&c., and at the same time be tormented by some
ailment which has baffled the MEDICAL PRO-
FESSION. Too close attention to business,
being confined too much indoors, and the worry
and trouble of everyday professional
or official life, will knock up the strongest man,
who is suffering from one of the many NER-
VOUS COMPLAINTS which the flesh is heir to.
His NERVES RUN DOWN, and his BRAIN
becomes dull, and all zest for his work is gone.
After incurring FOOLISHLY A BIG DOC-

How to excel at Billiards.
Only a few days ago a wonderful game of
billiards was witnessed in one of the principal
billiard saloons in this city, which fairly astonished
everyone present, inasmuch as one of the players
was known to suffer frotn a long-standing nervous
affection, so much so, that he could scarcely hold
the cue in his hand ; but notwithstanding this he
offered his opponent (who was a professional) 50
in 100, and beat him by 20. And he gave Herr
Rassmussen’s Alfaline Vitality Fills the
credit for his wonderful improvement.

Deep growlings greeted the decision of
Vic. police authorities on the case of the prisoner
who, the other day, escaped from the detective-
office. A sergeant and a constable were impli-
cated—one quite as seriously as the other—but the
subordinate only has been punished, by being
transfered back to uniform. Favoritism is declared
to be the explanation.
E. A. : The Fatman who talks so eloquently
about the honesty, industry, and manly independ-
ence of the Chow will possibly be a little broken-up
by a report just issued by Ballarat Benevolent
Society, According to this document, the Mongol
is the hardest beggar, impostor and mendicant on
the society’s books. In the large and populous
district which the society deals with there are 537
recipients of charity, and of these 190 are Chinese !
As the yellow man is only about one-twentieth of
the population, the society considers this rather
rough, and has thoughts of knocking the whole
generation of Ah Cat off the relief list in one act.

respectable landlords thereof. As some of them
are church-officers the exposure promises exciting
results. Meanwhile, the police have instructions
to clear the bagnios out of the main streets, and
drive them into the slums, so that respectable
Christianity won’t be shocked by the spectacle of
the elderly and somewhat decayed Tottie cooling
herself on the edge of the pavement on heat-wave
nights.
Dr. Cockburn (S.A.) at the Federal Con-
vention :—“lt could not be held that the Al-
mighty belonged to any particular religion.”
The cocksure Cockburn ! What does he know
about the private religious views of his Maker,
anyhow? The fact is that, judging by the state-
ments of theologians themselves—from the red-
hatted Cardinal and the Bishop in lawn sleeves
down to the humblest rusty-coated itinerant
expounder of the “Gawspel ” —there are as many
Almighties as there are creeds, or even denomina-
tions. And each Almighty appears to look upon
all the others as Impostors.
Melb. Leader tells a little story of the
Gippsland bush fires:
One family was found in the heart of the black desola-
tion living in a humpy hastily constructed of charred logs
and a few sheets of burnt iron. There were a husband
and wife and two children ; their clothes were the scanti-
est, and they had nothing else that the visitors could
discover. The mission of the latter was to help the most
necessitous amongst the victims of- the fires. “Can we do
anything for you, B ?” asked the authority. B
looked about him thoughtfully. “ Dunno as there is,” he
answered. “ But, man,” continued the astounded visitor,
“you’ll surely accept some assistance in your ex-
tremity.” Then B remembered, and said brightly :
“ Well, yes, there is somethin’ I want, and if you got sich
a thing as a porous plaster for the missus I’d be takin’ it
kindly.”
London possesses a magistrate, one
Francis, who habitually refuses to fine or im-
prison wife-beaters, his reason being that wife-
beating is one of the institutions of the lower-
class Bull, and is merely a habit, and the woman
who gets married in the East End must regard
her regular black eye as part of the contract.
And wife-beating is so far an institution in the
land of Bull that magistrate Francis still remains
on the bench. Recently a dweller in grimy
eastern London, feeling that he couldn’t wallop
his wife sufficiently to do justice to his feelings,
kerosened her and set her on fire. Francis dis-
missed the case and the fried female as a mere
“piece of mischief,” and even after that he is still
on the bench. The right of the Briton to bang his
“missus” has been always recognised.more or
less, but his right to set her on fire is something
new.
Suffield is still in his living grave, and the
N.S.W. Justice Department is jumping on him
with all its feet to make him fit that grave.
Suffield is a victim not only of Windeyerism, but
of Government by Contradiction. Both N.S.W.
political gangs, the ins and the outs, are interested
in justifying the actions of their respective Minis-
ters of Justice. A pamphlet fully dealing with
this monstrous wrong has just been published.

Curious feature about the penny George-
street ’bus proposal is that it was engineered by a
leading Sydney undertaker.
Brisbane (Q.) Echo has a fine and large
article on “ The Far East,” in which the Echo
claims to own the British navy, or something like
that. Witness :
Germany, France, and Russia . . . thought to sup-
plant our power, and usurp our influence in Eastern seas.
... In case of war, the more foreign war-ships that are
away from their home-stations the better for us, because,
although we give them any amount of latitude in time of
peace . . . Thus do we always keep tally with our foes.
(“ Rule Britannia” comes in here.) In fact, we intend to
hold our own, and as soon as we are more powerful in the
East —in a few weeks’ time—than the combined navies,
they will be quickly told to back down or be blown out of
the water. Requiescat in pace.
Bull, Buller, Bullest!
“ Ranji ” Hutton, in Sydney Daily Tele-
graph of 18th inst., talks “ through his hat ” on
the subject of the volunteer movement in N.S.
Wales, and endeavors to show how inferior the
volunteers are to the militia in dear old England.
He states that the volunteer corps are a “ broken
reed to trust to, ” and describes them as “ worse
than useless.” The general has evidently forgotten
certain statements made by him out here?, when,
in the presence of the writer and others, he clearly
and emphatically stated as his opinion that “ a
volunteer force was an ideal one for Australia,”
and that “ he was in favor of reducing the allow-
ance of the partially-paid forces so as to make
them more purely volunteer,” and this he was
afterwards instrumental in doing. Why this
sudden change ? Socially, the volunteers in Eng-
land are vastly superior to the militiamen, who
are mostly the scum of the cities, and enlist for
the little pay attached.
Pattisons, Limited, of 16 O’Connell-street,
Sydney, distillers and whisky merchants, and
dealers in all the miscellaneous drinks that gladden
the soul of man (and he generally needs it), desire
to call special attention to their Morning Dew
whisky. All their liquors are above par, but they
draw attention to the Morning Dew as a fair
sample of how far above it they are. It is a soft,
persuasive liquor, and the man who drinks it over-
night awakes bright and fresh in the morning
from a dream in which he was married to 16
houris in Paradise and had seized the streets of
pearl for arrears of rent. Morning Dew whisky
is, in a metaphorical way, food, nectar, purple
and fine linen, a mansion by the harbor, peace,
happiness, poetry, fair women, and the ownership
of the earth generally. And the man who isn’t
satisfied with that lot can buy more Morning Dew
whisky and have the solar system as well.*
Messrs. E. J. and D. Curran, of 112 King-
street, Sydney, and Exchange Buildings, Bathurst,
now measure their customers by electricity, the
process being the invention of Mr. E. J. Curran.
The results are exceptional accuracy of fit, a great
saving of time, and much less pawing of the cus-
tomer. Ladies’ costumes are one of the firm’s
specialities, and the advantages of a lady not
having to be needlessly pawed by a complete
stranger are obvious. The electric dodge gets
there so accurately that the wearisome fitting pro-
cess can, in most cases, be entirely dispensed with.*

while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

The Perth (W.A.) fire-
-I,ents have been until latel_
V small hose and reel was trotted out behind a
ab when required. On one occasion a resident,,
n discovering a fire, rushed to the station, but,
ound that the person in charge of the reel was
absent, so he ran out the apparatus himself. Arid
when the fire was doused he was gently taken into
custody for “ illegally' using the reel!
Westralia had, down to the beginning of
this year, a system under which if you—that is to
-’ay, your enemy—were sentenced to, say, 25 years’
imprisonment, he could get a ticket-of-leave at the
end of 7\ years, provided he were a first offender;
Now, he will have to serve at least 14 years and
5 months. The idea is that the Judges, in deter-
mining the sentence, now take into eonsideratiori
the previous conduct of the prisoner. Further,
"he change, though announced only towards the
middle of January, is to take effect from Decem-
ber 1 last, so that Anderson’s case may come under
it. Which is right enough, provided the Judge
didn’t have the old system in his eye when he
sentenced the young brute. And also, by the
way, it is probably right enough if he did ; for 7 k
years, and a ticket-of-leave at the end of it, would
hardly meet the case, anyhow.
Dear B.—Justice for black and white, if
you will, but give us even-handed justice, please.

The new Westralian Attorney-General has
been tumbled into a hole. Somebody was charged
at Geraldton with larceny from a convent school,
and it was believed that a certain Sister could
alone give evidence necessary for a conviction.
But Father Strong declared that the“ Sister in
question should only be dragged to court Over his
dead body. The case was adjourned ; and then
the P.M. got this wire :
Be paltry Stealing case. Sister Theresa’s evidence sub-
mitted to us, and cannot he material or have any value-
We suggest dispensing with her attendance. ' Kindlv
adopt our suggestion. Horgan and Pennefather.
Attorney-General Pennefather was, luckily for his
own reputation, away from Perth at the time;
but, if the wire wasn’t bogus (and that is not
suggested), the sooner he gives his private office »
lesson in discretion the better.
Rev. William Fulton, the Church of Eng
land clergyman who is to participate with Fsthet
Harrold and others in the N.S.W. ’9Bcelebrations,
enjoyed the singular destiny of returning volun-
tarily to the land of his exile. He was a Water-
ford man and one of the first fruits of the Eftim- ?
conspiracy which flowered into the Irish Rebellion,
and, on conviction, he was despatched in irons to
Botany Bay. _ When the Rebellion was stamped
out Fulton, with others, received a royal pardon,
and returned to the old land and the old duties.
But Marsden, the parson blacksmith who scourged
the convicts into hate and fear of all religion, had
contracted a friendship for Fulton, and offered
him, the position of Colonial Chaplain at what
was then a good salary and great expectations.
This offer Fulton accepted, and came back, a free
man, to the land in which he had been a convict.
He worked in Sydney for years and again returned
to Ireland—this time with a hatful of money.

The Case for the Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Dear Miss Welsh—how well she understands
the nature of men ! ”
The speaker was an elderly spinster, whose
locks were of a golden brown.
The room—Miss Welsh’B room, in Adelaide-
street, Potts Point —was crowded. Many women
were there, and here or there a man or two, or
what passed for a man in the assemblage. There
were exceptions. Sir John Blake, D.C. and
F.R.S.C., &c., was one of them ; and the massive
head, with its bushy eyebrows and crown of
silvered-hair, was noticeable when contrasted with
the gathering of pale curates, a canon, an arch-
deacon or two, and a few members of that class of
weedy men below the humble standard required
for the British army (5.3£, isn’t it?), which
strongly, though in a thin shrill voice, advocates
justice to women.
The occasion was a welcome to Lady Blake —
one of ’the great English leaders of the movement
in favor of the franchise for women. The wel-
come was given at Miss Welsh’s house —very pro-
perly. As a leader of the local forces, Miss Welsh
was acknowledged to be chief. She had sum-
moned around her the sympathisers with her
movement, male and female —those who, like her-
self, knew man as he is. Erom that point of
view, men not members of the female circle don’t
know him. ...
Let us admit the larger knowledge of the virgin
female. She knows that man has no other inte-
rest in life than the seduction of virtue. He
doesn’t care about money, professional success, or
anything else; even scandal and the threat of
social ruin will not deter him. He wants to
destroy virtue ; no other pursuit has any interest
for him. He laughs at history. Helen would
be unattractive because she had given way
to Paris. Cleopatra would be a waste of time
because —well —because, when she met Antony,
Bhe could not pretend to be the one thing which
men want. For men, so the sapient female
reasons, have but one desire, and that is to destroy
virtue wherever they find it.
But we are getting too far away from our lambs.
Revenons 1
We will not try to catalogue the company—
that always is tedious, and to one who has at-
tended a meeting of this kind unnecessary. Arch-
deacon Scribe was there, a few clergymen aspiring
to gaiters, and some of the laymen and laywomen
who are going to make the world a heaven indis-
tinguishable from a Presbyterian Sunday. Amongst
them Sir John Blake seemed to be somewhat out
of place. He was a poor thing, after all—merely
one of the leading scientific lights of the day,
knighted and likely to be made a baronet fpr
original work—but important in the drawing room
of Miss Welsh only as the husband of Lady Blake
—of Lady Blake, the great advocate of the female
suffrage movement in England, whom, as a visitor
to Australia, all these ladies and gentlemen were
met together in Miss Welsh’s drawing room to
honor.
It was in the midst of a pause in the general
conversation that Miss Allopecia Nunn made her
remark anent the knowledge of men displayed by
Miss Welsh. The remark was audible everywhere
in the room—perhaps to the satisfaction of the
speaker. The company was interested ; Miss
Welsh preened her social feathers and looked
round with the air of one who deprecates expected
general approval; Sir John gave a little cough
which might have indicated either approval or a
dissent from the proposition; and then a kind of
bomb fell into the assemblage.
“ I don’t think,” Lady Blake said in a quiet
voice, “ that we understand the nature of men—
any of us. I am not sure whether men under-
stand it themselves. We can observe certain
facts.” There was a humorous twinkle in her eye
as she fixed it upon her husband seldom seen in
the eyes of women, as she added : “ man is
by nature polygamous. I am not sure that we
know any other fact about him, with certainty.”
There was a sort of hesitating applause—of the
kind which is offered when people feel sure that
they ought to applaud the speaker, but are doubt-
ful about the sentiment. Sir John gazed at the
ceiling with a curious intentness which had
nothing to do with his interest in the ceiling.
“ What we have to do,” Lady Blake added,
addressing herself to a strained and interesting
silence, “ is to check this natural tendency in him
as far as we can.” There was a murmur of dis-
tinct approval. “That,” she said “is one of the
principal reasons why we mean to get the fran-
chise.”
The murmur grew louder, and Miss Welsh half
rose, as if she would say something ; but she sat
down and led a further chorus of subdued ap-
plause.
“Yes,” Lady Blake said, “we must get the
franchise. We want to be able to control our own
sex. Man must be protected.”
There was a silence.
“ It is time that he should be looked after,” she
added. “ He has been the victim of women by
far too long.”
Miss Welsh (who understood him) gave a little
gasp. Sir John Blake took the ceiling into his
confidence, as it were, and smiled at it.
“ Miss Welsh,” Lady Blake continued, “ has
asked me to say a few words to you, and I will
try to accede to her request. I want ypu to think
of man as he is. By nature, I am afraid that he
is what we call immoral (hear, hear !) and it is our
duty to help him to be better. (Hear, hear !)
Now, as a child, we women have charge of him ;
and I think that he is moral enough. (Hear,
hear.) But he grows up, and then —other women,
not we, have charge of him, and he becomes im-
moral. (Hear, hear.) Observe, he starts well,
and then falls away. Why ? ”
Nobody offered an answer to this question.
Lady Blake was left to deal with it. “I think,”
she said, “that human nature is very much the
same as any other nature.” Archdeacon Scribe
sighed deeply and audibly. Everybody looked at
him; and he felt that he had scored a point on
behalf of original sin and Mr. Scribe.
“ We see that,” Lady Blake continued, “ in the
Old Testament. Like a great many other animals,
man has a tendency towards polygamy. David
had it, and so had Solomon, not to mention several
of the patriarchs.”
“ That,” said the archdeacon, determined to
score again, “was the old dispensation.”
“Like the ten commandments,” the old lady
continued. “ I don’t see how you can throw away
the moral teaching of the Old Testament without
throwing away the ten commandments too. David
and Solomon came after Moses, and yet I don’t
know that their breaches of the seventh command-
ment came in for any very special condemnation,
except in particular cases.”
Her audience shivered; and the archdeacon
looked round in a dignified way—perhaps for his
hat. He met only the eye of Sir John Blake,
which had the expression which arises from total
want of expression. “ The conduct of Solomon,”
she continued, “ seems to have been regarded with
indifference, and, up to a certain point, even with
approval.”
There was a stir amongst the clerical and some
of the other members of Miss Welsh’s assembly.
It was something like the unquiet breeze which
seems to pick out certain particular trees in a
forest; but storm was averted because Lady Blake
altered the direction of her remarks —hardly, it is
to be feared, out of respect for her audience alone.
“ I said,” Lady Blake went on, “ that we don’t
understand the nature of man; but that we
observe certain facts. Also, I remarked that he
is good up to a certain point, and then appears to
fall away. Now in order to assist him towards
the good, we ought to consider for a moment why,
having started well, he runs towards evil —in other
words, we ought to glance at the history of the
ordinary male individual, and to see if the causes
tending towards deterioration can be minimised
or even averted.
“ Well now, plainly, what is that history ? ” The
question was oratorical perhaps—something like
those which so often are put from the pulpit or
the platform. Of course nobody tried to answer it.
“ I have given some attention to this matter,”
Lady Blake said, “ and, as I have been asked to
talk to you, I am going to talk plainly. Many of
you are mothers ” The phrase again was a
platform phrase ; as Lady Blake perhaps realised
in the face of a multitudinous flat-chested contra-
diction. She did her best to gloss over the slip.
“ God —or what with many of us stands for
God —has not seen fit to give me a child ; and
perhaps I speak ignorantly and even presumptu-
ously ; but if Providence had seen fit to allow me
to be a mother I believe that I should have
thought it my duty to enquire what my children
were likely to learn at the schools to which I
might choose to send them.”
A ruddy-faced curate —a sort of glorified public-
school-boy, suggestive of Harrow —said “ Heah,
heah ! ” and everybody stared at him until he
blushed dreadfully. He thought that he had
reached the pinnacle of human misery. He was
wrong ; as are all men who think that women can
separate principles from instances. Lady Blake
treated him tenderly enough ; Miss W elsh deter-
mined to deal with him later on.
“I don’t think,” Lady Blake continued, that
the average man has much chance of being really
moral. He goes to a school where he hears a
great many things which he ought not to hear at
the age at which he hears them. The prurient side
of his imagination is developed, before the moral
and reflective side has had time to grow ; his pas-
sions—unlike those of my own sex—in their
nature are initiative, and, as a consequence,
easily kindled; and, just at the point when
natural instinct and, it may be, curiosity
offer their own temptations, some woman,
years older than himself, gets hold of the
half-grown boy and leads him astray. I don’t
want to enlarge upon this topic too much.
Some of the reverend gentlemen present will
agree with me, no doubt, in thinking that this is
rather ancient history. Even in the far-away
times when the Proverbs were written the woman
is represented as being the tempter of the young
man, watching for him at the ”
“ That story,” Miss Welsh interjected, in dread-
ful tones, “ was written by a man.”
“Precisely,” Lady Blake replied, sweetly.
“ A man, I am afraid, would have the best
opportunity of knowing the truth of it; always
excepting those, like ourselves, who have studied
this difficulty—who have gone through the streets
of great cities and have noted how every step of
young men—innocent young men —is beset by
temptation, offered in the first instance by our own
sex—who also know how the polygamous in-
stinct, of which I have spoken, is systematically
nurtured and encouraged by women, until the
seduced becomes at last the seducer.”
“Miss Welsh,” Canon Buncombe was the
speaker, “ I regret that I am unable to remain
here any longer.”
“Pardon me, sir,” Lady Blake said. “By in-
vitation, I occupy the pulpit at the present
moment. In a church, if you do not agree with
the doctrine, you may leave, of course; but you
do not regard it as consonant with good manners
to address your protest to the congregation.”
“You are justifying immorality, madam.”
“I am defending nature, sir, against nonsense.
The days have come, I am sorry to say, when
nature needs defence. You know the old story of
the man who played with the tiger-cub. He used
to encourage the creature to lick his hand, until
one day it licked the skin off and tasted blood,

I don’t know what more Lady Blake was about
to say, or what moral she intended to draw. In a
moment, a buzz of conversation seemed to start
all over the room, which drowned the old lady’s
voice completely; and I saw Sir John, whose
opposition to his wife’s views upon the franchise
question was well-known, laughing in a quiet way.
I do not know what it was that amused him.

PRESSURE OF BUSINESS CAUSE OF HIS
ILL-HEALTH.
HIS SYSTEM ENTIRELY RUN DOWN.
248 Cardigan-st., Carlton, Melbourne,
December 31st, 1897.
The Manager, BILE BEAN MANUFACTUR-
ING CO., Sydney, N.S.W.
Dear Sir, —Owing to an exceptionally heavy and
protracted pressure of business during the past
few months, I became very low-spirited, my whole
system being fairly run down. I suffered a great
deal from insomnia, followed by loss of appetite,
and, in consequence, my nerves were completely
unstrung ; in fact, my nervous system was so
much upset that I became totally unfit for busi-
ness. A few weeks back a friend recommended a
course of Bile Beans, and I am pleased to say
that after using them for a shoi’t period the in-
somnia entirely disappeared and my appetite re-
turned. Since taking this medicine my weight
has increased nearly a stone, and I am now in the
best of health and spirits, and have no hesitation
in recommending them in all cases similar to my
own.
Gratefully yours,
(Signed) T. A. CHAPPEL.

Sick Headache.
Sick Headache is usually one of the symptoms
of biliousness, constipation, or other derangements
of the digestive organs. It is accompanied by
nausea, from which it derives its name, and is
E rally more violent in the front part of the
. The appetite is impaired, and there is a
bad taste in the mouth. There is a general want
of energy, and the sufferer is irritable and restless.
These headaches are caused by gases rising from
the digestive organs to the head, crowding the
nerves of the brain, and causing at times sharp
pains behind the eye-balls. Bilk Beans for
Biliousness will be found an excellent remedy, as
they put the digestive organs in good working
arder, enabling them to carry off the waste matter
uf the body.

Dear Sirs, —I have been for some years subject
to Biliousness and Headache, and, seeing Bilk
Beans were so extensively advertised, I decided
to give them a trial, and accordingly put myself

I experienced relief from the beginning, and to-day

Bile Beans for Biliousness
act on the liver, enabling that organ to furnish
the natural carthartio for the bowels. They are
gentle in their action, thus avoiding the very-
harmful results brought about by most laxative
remedies of to-day, which act in a violent manner.
BILE BEANS are manufactured in one of the
largest and best-equipped laboratories in the
world, in Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A. They have
been used throughout the country for years by
the most eminent medical men, and their great
worth lies in the fact that they act directly on the
bile ducts and do not purge or strain the bowels,
therefore avoiding all vile after-effects that follow
the using of nearly all purgative medicines sold
to-day. They are an undoubted specific for Head-
ache, Indigestion, Constipation, Debility, Dys-
pepsia, Piles, PimpleSj Female Ailments, Sallow
Complexion and all Liver Troubles. They may
be obtained at all chemists, or direot from the

THE WOE KI NEMAN'S ERIEND.
Round the Clock.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Like a fresh wind blown out of a lightning-
charged cloud his new life fell, blown out
from his old.
’Twas a song, ’twas a prayer, ’twas a sigh !
’Twas a speech, ’twas a drumbeat, a cry !
’Twas a flash of the soul that survives when the
turbulent kingdoms of flesh and blood die !
In the marginal east surged and eddied a tumult
of mountainous billows that rolled, .
Warring, out to the shining blue levels of sea with
faint fringes of white ;on the right
Huddled cities enwreathed with the smoke of
the work of the hands and the tongues and
the brains
Of the builders and killers of peoples; to left lay a
languorous land of delight
Where the senses swoon ; and to rear stood the
houses of Death in a mist of low rains.
Like a fresh wind he broke to the east for a space
and engaged with the eddying froth.
What was tumult of wave to him now,
With the new life alight on his brow,
But a summons to reap what the forces of Nature
to those who command them allow ?
The strong boisterous waves shook the marginal
rocks with their onsets of billowy wrath,
And he met them, now dipping beneath spiral
columns to rise in a spume-trough of mist,
Now clambering over a mountain of foam with
air swollen, pink-tinted with light,
And anon striking into a narrow low gorge where
the fringes of ridged billows kissed,
And at last floating out to the wide level sea,
with long ripples of blue and or white.
Like a fresh wind he turned to the right where
dense cities, smoke-wreathed and smoke-
garmented, lay ;
With a cry on his lips and a hum
In his heart, like the roll of a drum
Afar off, he passed through the thronged main-
ways of thunderous clamor and laborings
dumb;
And beheld the achievements of muscle and brain
at fierce work on the world night and day,
Building up, breaking down, giving life, taking
life ; and he said as he witnessed the strife,
While extending a hand to the lowly of spirit
and staying the violent strong,
“ If the millions of meek would but stand by the
weak they between them would blow a new
life
For the world from the midnight black cloud-
wrack above it of tyranny, madness, and
wrong.”
Like a fresh wind he turned to the left from the
cities that bootlessly struggled for ease;
And his eyes became dim in a light
That was neither of day nor of night,
But a blending of darkness more dark than the
night and of light than the noonday’s more
bright.
His blood pulsed in a slow sleepy rhythm, keeping
time with a slow sleepy pageant of trees,
All whose leaves were in slow sleepy motion ; of
birds with red breasts and blue wings and
white crests
In a slow sleepy motion in air and on bough ;
and a slow sleepy luminous flight
Of the tiny bright life which in infinite sparkles
the plains and the ridges infests ;
Till his senses grew drunk with the wine of the
indolent pageant of rhythmic delight.
With head swimming, eyes dim and feet feeble,he
stumblingly turned his white face to the
rear ;
There were mounds to the left and the right
Which his dizzy and palpitant sight
Recognised as the low-lying houses of Death in
the vaporous mists of wan light.
There, asleep, side by side, lay the friends whose
affection in life had been frozen to fear
By the wind of a vagrant suspicion ! and there,
fast asleep, foot near foot, head near head,
Lay the lovers whose lives were a song! and
asleep, all asleep, the wild spirits of strife
And the lowly of heart. And a cloud fell upon
him, and he, too, was one with the dead,
For the hand of the clock of his wandering
being had traversed the disc of his life !

The Secret of the Crocodiles.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was in Borneo. A man, pushing suddenly
through the rustling calamasks, stood in the door-
way of the hut, and Beckley hailed with feeble
gladness the only human being he had seen for six
weeks. “ Come in, my friend, come in ! You are
just in time —thank God ! ”
The stranger came in; a long, hatchet-faced
man, with a scanty red beard, and a squint in the
little grey eyes that peered from under his bat-
tered kika-grass hat. He leant a Winchester
rifle against the door-post. “ What’s the matter
with you?” he asked, up-ending a wicker fish-
trap and sitting down close to the naturalist’s
bunk. “ Goin’ to peg out, eh ? ”
“ Fever’s the matter —swamp-fever ! Been bad
for a week, and to-day I’m too feeble to get as far
as my medicine-chest. There it is in the corner.
Give it a lift this way, will you ? It’s a provi-
dence you happened in upon me like this ! ”
But the “ providence ” was in no hurry. With-
out so much as a glance at the medicine-chest, he
deliberately lighted his quacca-nut pipe and
smoked for about a minute in silence. “Know
me ? ” he asked then.
“ No, I don’t! But, whoever you are, I wish to
heaven you would ”
“Wait a minute; all in good time! You’ve
never seen me before, I know ; but p’r’aps you’ve
heard of a chap called Rixon—Red Rixon, eh ?
Ay, I see you have—and not much good either.
Well, now you know who you’re talkin’ to; what
d’you s’pose I’m goin’ to do? Doctor you up a
bit, eh ? Not much, sonny ! You’re pretty near
passin’ in your checks, by the look of you, and I’m
not goin’ to stir a finger to prevent it. That
knocks you a bit, don’t it ?”—and Mr. Red Rixon
grinned amiably at the astounded sick man.
“ What do you mean?” gasped Beckley. “Why,
» be nothing short of -order , ■
“Not a bit of it! Lettin’ a man die ain’t
murder ! You see it’s this way. I’ve been hearin’
a good deal about you lately, and, whatever other
people may think, I’m not such an almighty flat
, ~. , , , .. ,
as to believe you ve been so long wastin your
time and riskin’ your life in this God-forsaken
hole of a country all for the sake of a few measly
beasts and birds and insecks ! ” and here Mr.
Rixon, looking contemptuously round the speoi-
men-covered walls, spat with great accuracy into
the eye of a tame lemur.
The naturabst gazed at him in stupefaction.
What was it for, then?’’he asked.
“Gold, sonny—gold ! That’s what it’s for.
You see, you’re a tip-top jologist, or whatever they
call it, and so you know the likeliest places to find
-sr , , . .. , , , ,
it. You weren t so long fossickin’ round the head
of the Sobal River for nix, I’ll take my oath! ”
A faint smile dawned upon Beckley’s chalky
a^r l1 YOUVeCO ) m ° r °^ me hen? h6Baid -
Well, we won t quarrel about words. At all
events, it’s after the yellow stuff I’ve pushed out
into this hell’s nest of swamps and serpents, and
it wasn’t likely I was goin’ back empty-handed,
even if I had to put a bullet through you. No
need for that now, though. The fever’ll settle yon

ashes out of his pipe and rose to begin his per-
quisitions—there flashed a terrible thought into
Heoklev’s brain “ Tf the fpver kill mo ”

after all.” ’
“ That’s thp talk mv ninnin I” aaid
ihat s the talk, my pippin ! said the other
as he eagerly shifted over the big red jars. I
knew you d hear reason. I was bound to have the
stuff anyhow, but this’ll save trouble. Now, then
—where ? ”
Beckley turned his face from the man’s gaze.
“ In the corner ” he said between his set teeth

“behind the big mias-skin, there’s another
chamal. You needn’t bring it out. Take the mat
off the top, put your hand in and you’ll find—
what you re looking for!” And then, with his
face to the wall, he listened breathlessly.
He heard the mias-skin thrust aside, the mat
rudely torn off the jar—then there was a muttered
oath, and Rixon came angrily out of the cornert
“There’s no gold there ! ” he said. “Only some
blasted thorny thing that’s pricked my ”
His words died away as he looked at the back
of his hand and saw two tiny blood-spots a quarter
of an inch apart. f Instinctively he glanced back
to the corner, just in time to see a wavering streak
yehow glide swiftly from it to the door. “My

A flame-adder ! I’m done for ! And you ?—ay,
I see now !—this was the gold you wanted me to

I he first throat-spasm silenced him, as he staggered
towards his Winchester. But the virus of the
jataca was too swift; his sight was going; and,
after two or three useless grasps at the rifle, he
fell on his face and lay there.
“ Not murder—but justice ! ” muttered Beckley,
as, three days later, he hove the hideously-swollen
corpse into the lagoon. And the crocodiles kept
the secret well!

The i 4 true inwardness ” of golf has re-
cently been expounded by one Doctor Louis
Robinson, re whose lucubrations thus San Fran-
cisco Wasp :
To most people golf looks like a bad excuse for killing
tune, and the people engaged in it are chiefly distin-
guished by. wearing “knee-pants” and loudly-checked
suits, in which habiliments they chase a little ball over a
large part of the county in which they reside. One may
see the devotees of the game any Saturday afternoon at
the Presidio. They in no wise strike you as being the
deeply scientific individuals who alone could master a
game such as Dr. Robinson describes. According to this
eminent writer, in football, cricket and almost all popular
athletic sports there is what he calls “ a continual inter-
action of wills and the constant excitement of opposed
endeavors, hence the mental and nervous processes in-
volved are extremely complex and no chance offered for
calm, introspectic analysis as in the great game of golf.”
When one begins to analyse “ the physiological pro-
cesses,” as Dr. Robinson calls them, involved in golf play-
ing, one soon becomes astonished at their complexity.
Not half as much, however, we should judge, as that any
one outside a lunatic asylum would sit down to write such
bosh. We thoroughly agree with Dr. Robinson that it is
remarkable how the game of golf has obtained the foot-
ing it has in the States. It is no mystery, however, why
it has done so. We have, in proportion to our popula-
tion, the finest assortment of snobs in the world, and as
golf is a game that has many pretensions to be ex-
clusive and aristocratic it readily endears itself to the
shining lights of snobdom. Outside of a very small pro-
portion of genuine enthusiasts who learned the game in
their youth in Scotland, it has no genuine admirers in
this country. Seven out of ten of the people who don
golf socks and swing a crooked stick all day over a wind-
swept moor have no further interest in the game than to
be known as belonging to the social set that supports the
golf club. It is a hollow pretence to hang upon the skirts
of the “ 400,” and the man who undertakes to write about
the game in a scientific way in a high-class magazine
should have his head examined by a lunacy commission.

“Shortly after leaving Johannesburg, where we had resided several
years, I contracted a fever, which left me in a very weak state. I was a
iong time without any improvement, and none of the various remedies 1
tried, under the doctor’s direction, did me any good. My husband finally
persuaded me to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, which cured several acquaintances
of ours who had suffered from impoverished blood and general debility. I
thciefore began to take the Sarsaparilla, and its good influence was soon
apparent. Within less than a month I was as well as ever, and could eat
and sleep like a child. Gratefully yours,
