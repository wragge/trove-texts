BIRTHPLACE OF THE ENGLISH NATION: BATTKE ABBEY
TTO commemorate his victory over Harold and his Saxons and
A in fulfilment of a vow made before the fateful battle, William
the Conqueror at once began the building of his great abbey. It
was not. completed, howeve'r, until the reign of his successor,
William Rufus. The foundation was extremely wealthy and
enjoyed many privileges for almost five centuries, and at the time
of the dissolution in 1538 it had an income equivalent to £lO,OOO
a year. Henry VIII awarded the property to a rich favourite, Sir
Anthony Browne, who pulled down the church, cloisters and
chapter-house and transformed the remaining buildings into a
magnificent private mansion.
Those who believe in the efficacy of curses will not be
surprised to learn that the prophecy said to have been made to
Sir Anthony Browne by one of the dispossessed monks, that his
line would be cut off by fire and water, was actually verified 255
years afterwards. Even under later owners fire afid water have
taken their toll of the occupants of Battle Abbey.
The principal portions of the old monastic buildings which are
shown to the public are the gate-house, with its triple archway
which has remained almost unchanged for over five centuries; the
three crypts, one of which was the library of the monastery ; and
the fragments of the high altar which, according to tradition, was
erected on the exact spot where Harold fell, together with the
flower of Saxon nobility, all of whom died with him.
What was so long ago the scene of a murderous struggle, in
which no quarter was asked or given, has for centuries been a haunt
of ancient peace. Indeed, the gardens of Battle Abbey in themselves
justify a visit to Abbey, situated in Sussex, near Hastings.

VIRGINIA WOOLF'S ESSAYS .
Although she did not like Byron, Vir-
ginia Woolf, it is to be seen in The
Moment and Other Essays (Hogarth
Press; Angus and Robertson), had an
affection for trout-fishing: so that she
was human as well as austere and her
genius was tempered by simplicity.
The attack on Byron comes in an essay
on Dickens which, as a whole, illustrates
the depth and penetration of her criticism
rather than its limitations. She writes,
“Of all great writers Dickens is the least
personally charming and the least person-
ally present in his books,” and, at first
glance, recalling Dickens’s continual
appearances in the first-person in his
novels, the statement seems fantastic, the
reverse of the truth ; but Virginia Woolf
was not trying to pretend that Dickens
does not come on stage, but that the per-
sonality he presented—“stalwart, weather-
beaten, self-reliant, with a great contempt
for the finicky, the inefficient or the
effeminate”—was a fake. She goes on;
His sympathies indeed have strict limi-
tations. Speaking roughly, they fail him
whenever a man or a woman has more than
two thousand a year, has been to the
university, or can count his ancestors back
to the third generation. They fail him when
he has to treat of the mature emotions —
the seduction of Emily, or the death of
Dora; whenever it is no longer possible to
keep moving and creating, but it is neces-
sary to stand still and search into things
and penetrate to the depths of what is
there... .The despair of Mrs. Steerforth or
the anguish of Ham are of an indescribable
unreality—of that uncomfortable complexion
which, if we heard Dickens talking so in
real life, would either make us blush to
the roots of our hair or dash out of the
room to conceal our laughter.
The criticism could be modified ; after
all, if Shakspeare, as Virginia Woolf
says, expresses his personality throughout
his works though you can never lay your
hand on him, there is surely something—
a great deal —of a genuine, laughter-
loving Dickens to be found in his char-
acters. As for the failure to deal justly
with rich or aristocratic characters, there
is Lady Dedlock; and as for the failure
with the “mature” emotions, there is
Bradley Headstone and his demonic
jealousy. But “roughly speaking”—and
in a short essay one is forced to speak in
generalities—it is a deep and a sound
analysis:
Agitated as he was by the most violent
passions, ablaze with indignation, teeming
with queer characters, unable to keep the
dreams out of his head at night, nobody
appears, as we read him, more free of the
foibles and eccentricities and charms of
genius.
After this comes the limitation; one of
several kinds of “foibles and eccentricities”
to be found in The Moment. “I would not
cross the road (reasons of curiosity
apart),” says Virginia Woolf, “to dine
with Wordsworth, Byron or Dickens.”
Well, Dickens may deserve it: his conces-
sions to popular sentiment were - a be-
trayal of the arts. But poor Wordsworth!
He might have been a bit dull in his old
age, but has Virginia Woolf not yet for-
given him for coming to his senses about
the French Revolution and seeing it as
the horrible blood-bath it was? As for
Byron—not the juvenile Byron of “Childe
Harold,” on whom the Byron legend is
based, but the Byron of “Don Juan”
and of the. vivid and amusing Letters —we
might take Shelley’s word for it that he
was worth dining with:
I say that Maddalo [Byron] is proud,
because I can find no other word to express
the concentred and impatient feelings which
consume him; but it is on hopes
and affections only that he seems to trample,
for in social life no human being can be
more gentle, patient and unassuming than
Maddalo. He is cheerful, frank and witty.
His more serious conversation is a sort 6f
intoxication; men are held by it as by a
spell. He has travelled much; and there
is an inexpressible charm in his relation of
his adventures in different countries.
Virginia Woolf says she “venerates
Byron’s genius,” so the attack on his per-
sonality is, in this instance, of no con-
sequence as far as her criticism is con-
cerned. But what is one to make of her
extraordinary attack on D. H. Law-
rence?
There was, to begin with, Trespassers, a
hot, scented, overwrought piece of work,
as it seemed; then A Prussian Officer, of
which no clear impression'remained except
of starting muscles and forced obscenity;
then two little books of poems, Nettles
and Pansies, which read like the sayings
that small boys scribble upon stiles to make
housemaids jump and titter.
There is a measure of truth in this; and
there is obviously a far larger measure of
puritanism. Pansies is too slipshod and
unsophisticated in technique to rank high
as poetry, but as a book of aphorisms it
is as brilliant and as profound as a novel
by Virginia Woolf.
Puritanism is the most conspicuous
limitation of The Moment, but the
book is also, especially in its excursions
into art criticism, limited by the prevail-
ing intellectual fashions. Thus, while the
French Impressionists and Post-Impres-
sionists from Cezanne to Picasso are
accepted without question, there is no
mention of Sargent or Orpen. “Subject-
pictures”—the Victorian paintings that
tried to tell a story—are derided as
“pathetic,” and it has obviously not
occurred to the essayist that a puzzle-
picture by Picasso or Dali is simply the
subject-picture in a modern disguise: the
substitution, one might say, of a con-
temporary detective story for the novel
of Dickens and Trollope.
Again, while considering the limita-
tions of the book, one must note a certain
insularity in an essay on Sinclair Lewis.
Virginia Woolf’s theory on Babbitt com-
pels attention; and it remains, if not the
whole truth, impressive as a half-truth:
Lewis has not identified himself with
America; rather he has constituted himself
the guide and interpreter between the
Americans and the English and, as he
conducts his party of Europeans over the
typical' American city (of which he is a
native) and shows them the typical Ameri-
can citizen (to whom he is related), he is
equally divided between shame at what he
has to show and anger at the Europeans
for laughing at it. Zenith is a despicable
place, but the English are even more des-
picable for despising it.
But Lewis, one remembers, took pains
to bring an English Babbitt into Babbitt.
Had he lived in England he would still,
like Swift, have written satire. Essentially,
Zenith is contrasted not with some
English or European city but with an
Ideal City: that terrible, imaginary abode
of bliss, peopled entirely by unemployed
reformers, from which satirists look down
to our poor earth. Virginia Woolf is in
error when she assumes this appalling
paradise to be, say, Manchester.
But neither “puritanism” nor “insu-
larity” are quite the right words for the
limitations of The Moment —even
though Virginia Woolf appears to rate
Sinclair Lewis as merely equal or even
inferior to H. G. Wells and Arnold
Bennett. A writer who defends Con-
greve against the absurd moralistic cen-
sures of Dr. Johnson is certainly not to
be confused with the ordinary suburban
wowser. There is shown in this book a
fastidious femininity, a shrinking from the
masculine personality when, in Byron as
in Lawrence—so vivid was the poet’s im-
press on time —it looms too close. In
the essay on Sinclair Lewis Virginia
Woolf writes:
Women writers have to meet many of the
same problems that beset Americans, they
are too conscious of their own peculiarities
as a sex; apt to suspect insolence, quick
to avenge grievances, eager to shape an art
of their own—
and implicit in that statement lies the
motive of all the essays of The Moment.
Virginia Woolf was eager to shape an
art of her own ; a new, a European, a
feminine art. And this, as most writers
do when they come to criticism, she felt
obliged to defend; against Percy Lub-
bock’s insistence on form in the novel,
against Lewis’s American gusto, against
any writer (Dickens and Lewis included,
perhaps) who seemed excessively mascu-
line. A certain desirable breadth is, con-
sequently, absent from The Moment:
but not profundity, nor grace.
This is the second volume of essays to
be published after Virginia Woolf’s
death, and a third is apparently to fol-
low. Those rare qualities of luminosity
and intensity and that singular delicacy
of style that are to be found in her novels
are also in all the essays, even where the
range of thought is limited ; and when the
writer is free to affirm works congenial
to her taste she is wholly delightful. The
best essay, significantly, is a defence of
a woman —the admirable and colorful
Mrs. Thrale, whom most commentators,
following Dr, Johnson, have seen only
through a mist of rage; and the second-
best is an excellent account of the diary
of that wild, impassioned and not too
heavily masculine man Haydon, who died
by his own hand and who, Virginia Woolf
thinks, was a genius and" should have
been a writer instead of a painter.
"Brimming Billabongs."
It is sad that W. E. Harney’s Brim-
ming Billabongs (Angus and Robertson)
should give one a sinking feeling. Mr.
Harney has previously written excellent
factual accounts of his life among the
aboriginals; he has a pleasing title here,
and, for attempting to tell the life-story
of an aboriginal, he deserves nothing but
praise.
Nevertheless, one sinks. The abo-
riginal, named Marmel, who is supposed
to tell the story in his own words, does
not talk like an aboriginal, nor yet like
a white man, but like a book ; and a poor
book at that —an old-fashibned book,
loaded with stale romantic cliches. “Tim-
buk, ever the leader,” says Marmel, try-
ing to tell how his brother confronted a
Timor pony, “marched boldly out to
give battle with the dreaded monster.”
“Animals and yams,” says Marmel,
“abounded.”
Sometimes, to bring in a piece of abo-
riginal lore, Mr. Harney makes Marmel
deliver a short, improbable lecture:
“Karmoo cried aloud and beat the ground
with her digging stick, defying the evil
tree spirits who had tried to destroy us.
For with usi everything is caused by
spirits and nothing happens as a natural
event.”
Sometimes, in a moment of realism, he
translates the aboriginals in this way:
“ ‘Let’s gammon we are old men and
talk big,’ said the Kungman.” And then,
on the next page, while dealing with the
same adventure, the author has a re-
newed attack of romanticism and changes
the tone of the dialogue to: “ ‘Hold,’
cried Timbuk, ‘we are going the wrong
way.’ ”
Mr. Harney himself appears to have
felt a certain uneasiness over his style,
for he says in his introduction, “It is my
earnest wish that the ‘clever fellows’
(Marmel’s own words) will pause and
read before they raise their learned eye-
brows and discuss the this and that of
native language and its translations. The
aborigines of this land have a very com-
plete vocabulary of several thousand
words. True translation must go deeper
than the meaning of the word.”
The uneasiness is well-founded. He
would indeed be a “clever fellow,”
rightly deserving Mr. Harney’s and Mar-
iners scorn, who suggested that the
native tongue should be translated into
pidgin ; but it should, of course, go into
living English words, direct and simple.
Mr. Harney’s mistake lies in trying to
be literary when he should be natural.
With all the goodwill in the world, an
almost irresistible twitching of the eye-
brow must occur when one encounters an
old bushman (white) speaking in the
same over-poetic style as Marmel: “My
dad was head stockman on a big cattle-
run, none better than he ; but when he
died our family scattered over the
country like the floating seeds that burst
from the wild banana-pods of the dry
lands.”
The fault of style is serious: it under-
mines the credibility of the book ; as, too,
does a certain sentimentality of tone in
Marmel’s yearning for “brimming billa-
bongs,” his veneration for aboriginal tra-
ditions and his various complaints
against the white man for not understand-
ing the tribal code and for usurping his
tribal lands. It all sounds too explicit,
too romantic, too exactly coinciding with
the opinions of literary groups in the
cities, too facile. There is a measure of
truth in it, and Marmel may really have
said something of the sort; but it sounds
too much like Mr. Harney putting words
into Manuel's mouth.
To enjoy the book it is necessary to
read, so to speak, between the lines; to
look beneath the romantic veneer for the
solid facts which Mr. Harney does know
about Arnhem Land and about the abo-
riginals. And if it is approached in this
way it is worth reading. There are prob-
ably very few Australians’ who know pre-
cisely how an Arnhem Land aboriginal
would spend his life from birth to old
age, and Manuel's career —from his child-
hood years with his tribe and his first
adventures with Malays to his experiences
in pearling, on cattle stations and with a
band of “outlaw” aboriginals in a place
that would make a paradise for the ghosts
of departed bushrangers—is varied and
colorful.
Thompson and the Devil .
What English newspaper is favored
with Mr. R. W. Thompson’s meditations
as, hounded by the devil, he rushes to and
fro across Europe is not stated on the
jacket of Devil at My Heels (MacDonald),
but it is safe to assume that his contribu-
tions would not lack color. When the
sun rises in Devil at My Heels it “glares:
like a bombshell.”
Mr. Thompson belongs to a tribe now
almost forgotten; the Famous Corre-
spondents of 1936 to 1939, whose books
sold by the hundred-thousand and are
now, though some of them did good ser-
vice in their time, waste-paper. As the
last of the giants, or perhaps a new kind
of somewhat smaller giant, Mr. Thomp-
son seeks to ward off oblivion by racing
with the speed of light and talking in a
deafening roar.
True to the grand tradition, he is from
first to last his own hero, and, in the
opening pages, manages somehow to con-
vey the impression that, after he had
liberated Belgium and turned the Ger-
mans out of Paris, and after his young
friend Field-Marshal Montgomery “that
evening in the tent at Luneberg had dic-
tated and accepted the enormous surren-
der that heralded the end,” it is really a
monstrous thing that still “I had known
no peace.” It takes Mr. Thompson nine
weeks to get a visa for Yugoslavia, and
during that time “I kicked my heels in
bitter frustration in London, waiting, un-
certain, unable to settle anything.”
Since the author has “a restless devil
at my heels” it would appear extremely
perilous to keep him in London lashing
out in ihis fashion: he might injure not
only himself but the devil. Mr. Thomp-
son also suffers from “an itch, a ferocious
itch”—to travel, presumably—and alto-
gether seems in a bad way in the first
chapter. The visa, fortunately, is granted,
and thereafter, as he visits Prague,
Vienna, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, one
sees a good deal of those places and a
good deal more of Mr. Thompson—
Mr. Thompson having “my vitals
gnawed]’ in Brussels ; Mr. Thompson re-
calling in Paris “the mad week of libera-
tion when the avalanche of passionate
emotion swept through me like a fire,
leaving me charred and empty”; Mr.
Thompson writing his dispatches by “the
glare of blazing brandy” ; Mr. Thomp-
son complaining that he is uncomfortable
in a train and at the same time declar-
ing that he never objects to discomfort;
Mr. Thompson having his “illusions
about America dispelled” and expressing
the most fantastic views about the
“danger” of U.S. “imperialism”; Mr.
Thompson seeing practically the entire
youthful population of Yugoslavia march-
ing in the dawn_to work, singing; Mr.
Thompson bothered by politicians; Mr.
Thompson hot, Mr. Thompson cold;
Mr. Thompson drinking Cliquot Rose,
slivavice, borovicka, rakija and a dozen
other such exotic substances; Mr.
Thompson dropping into “a trough of
gloom” in Sofia, but, with his wonted
ebullience, quickly “gathering myself for
my final leap to the Black Sea.”
As a result of such feats of speed and
levitation the author moves a little too
rapidly to keep perfectly synchronised
with European events, fast as they move
these days. He roundly declares that
Czechoslovakia is “not a Communist
country,” and then, perhaps while he is
jumping the Channel back to England,
Czechoslovakia, comparatively at its
leisure, goes Communist. There is a
general impression throughout Devil at
My Heels that Mr. Thompson has
arrived in some place just too late to
see what is happening or that he leaves
just too soon.
But for that Mr. Thompson is not
altogether to be blamed. His book is a
picture of the steady advance of Com-
munism through Europe, the progress of
tyranny, the liquidation of the opposi-
tion, the destmction of freedom; and
even in Yugoslavia it takes some time
for the O.S.N.A. to operate quite as suc-
cessfully as the O.G.P.U. It is a book
for its hour —near enough for the pre-
sent hour —and, when all has been said,
not a bad one.
One grows to like Mr. Thompson. Ex-
cept on the subject of America, a country
which makes him burst like one of bis
bombshell sunrises, his political views
are amiable, and, beneath*’ all his
excessive displays of emotion, be
has both commonsense and humanity:
he brings distant places clearly into
view, he makes distant peoples human.
In fact, one hopes that everybody in
future grants him his visas with incred-
ible celerity and that the devil at his
heels never catches up with him. While
he can leap from Sofia to the Black Sea
that, fortunately, is unlikely.
“Mark Heim”: What your reviewer
(R.P. 10/3/’4B) finds amiss in Gid&’s
Journals Vol. 1 was more or less foie-
shadowed by Oscar Wilde, who said of
him to Lord Alfred Douglas: “Andre is
an egotist without an ego.” Wilde and
Douglas looked upon Gide as a sort of
literary parasite who attached himself to
others to get and not to give. Continued
Oscar: “His moralisings are tedious and
really impertinent, and he has a dirty
mind, and whatever my views majappe
about sin, I dislike dirt.” Later, wide,
ostracised from society like Wilde him-
self, and for books' bearing upon the
unnatural vice which was Wilde’s weak-
ness, tried to make out that he had been
a close friend of Oscar’s. But Oscar
Wilde disliked Gide from the beginning,
made fun of him and told him the most
absurd and hair-raising stories about him-
self which the Frenchman swallowed.
The earlier Gide was a man who had
not found himself; Wilde would say
there was no self to find.

What treatment should be used to
kill a large bougainvillea plant?
Cut it down a$ much as possible,
then bore hole in the butt and pour
into it a solution of white arsenic
or crude kerosene and seal down.
Keep all suckers cut close to the
stem, and remove as much bark as
possible. It will take a long while
before the plant is destroyed. Wm.

How to remove tdttoo-marks ?
Under expert treatment tattoo-marks
of the simpler type can be removed
or more or less minimised by the
application of a concentrated solution
of tannic acid in conjunction with
local caustics. The essential needling,
either manual or electric, requires
some care and technical skill; cor-
rectly performed, subsequent scarring
is reduced to a minimum. Best see

What is otosclerosis and what is
the cure?
Oto-sclerosis is the medical term for
progressive increase in deafness.
Heredity predisposes to the condition,
but it may occur at any age, und in
late years is a manifestation of
senility. The inherited type tends to
run through the female line. There
is a hardening of tissues of the middle
ear with loss of function in the
auditory nerve-endings. Pain is usually
absent, but a sense of numbness
accompanies the loss of hearing about
the affected part. There is no exact
cure.

EMPIRE DAY
BY BRIAN JAMES.
EMPIRE DAY, thirty-five years
ag0...,A big Union Jack floated
or flapped on the big white pole,
A large platform of boards and
trestles stood at the rear of the main
building at Sir John’s-road, and had
been cunningly fitted against the wall so
that the visitors stepped on to it from
the main corridor.
Half-rings of chairs had been placed
on this platform, symmetrically placed
at the rear of it, and a smaller half-ring
had been placed round a flag-draped
table. Flags and bunting everywhere.
Small Union Jacks on round deal sticks
were in the hands of nearly every child.
The boys were drawn in a solid square
—most of them in their obviously best
clothes, though there were bare feet, too.
Hair —even rebellious hair —brushed as
never before. Altogether that distinct
impression of severest grooming.
Teachers in groups of twos or threes
in evidence—mostly at the wings or rear.
Girls marching in from their yard in
twos —and formed into another solid
square as complement to the boys.
The lady teachers standing in twos and
threes at the wings or rear. Infants, in
smaller numbers, taking up the space
between the platform and the boys and
girls. Incipient murmurs here and there
suppxessed. A great air of expectancy
settling down on a multitude. The empty
platform was watched as though the
Great Ones might magically materialise,
even while one glanced away,
AT length Mr. Goodman, the head-
master, came out of the door and on to
the platform. He looked different some-
how. Hitherto the ordinary human feel-
ing and the vulgar show of emotion had
been no part of Mr. Goodman. But
now a strained air was upon him. Mr,
Goodman was wearing the Great Occa-
sions Black, and he was nervous. That
showed, if nothing else did, how great
was Empire Day 35 years ago.
MR. GOODMAN spoke:
“Boys and girls, our very import-
ant visitors will soon —Get out that fellow
moving his head! You in the grey coat.
No, not you—the fellow on the other side.
Yes, you! You knew all the time.
What’s your name? Did you say Buck-
teeth? Oh, Duckworth, is it? Well,
what is duck worth, I’d like to know?
Wait at my office, Duckworth, and I’ll
see if I can cure you of the fidgets.”
This piece of side-play was perhaps to
hide nervousness and get into form. Of
course, Mr. Goodman knew the boy’s
name all the time, but there was a rare
touch of humor in the assumed ignor-
ance. Crestfallen, Duckworth went into
the building by another door, and duti-
ful grins followed.
“That’s the sort of thing I can’t have,”
the head said. “Inattention. Now, boys
and girls, our very important visitors
will be here in a few moments. As they
file on to the platform I’ll raise my hand,
like this, see! And you are to clap for
welcome. Good hearty clapping. Bring
your hands together like this —watch!
When I raise my hand —like this, see!
—stop clapping at
once, and those of
you with flags,
wave them l above
your heads. Get out
that fellow waving
his flag now. I
didn’t tell you to
wave now, did I?'
You are a disgrace
to the Empire. Go
and join Buckteeth!
I hope there are no
more fools about.
Take care not to
poke each other in
the eyes with your
flag-sticks. Well!
What’s wrong with
you ?”
A screwy, writh-
ing little specimen
in the front line of
the boys was franti-
cally waving an
arm.
“Please, sir, can I
go out?”
Mr. Goodman snorted a permission
that implied that there was something
particularly disgraceful about this request
at such a time.
Parents, mostly mothers, begSn to
arrive, sometimes singly, sometimes in,
tyros and threes. Often they were vague,
uncertain, lacking in confidence. By some
remarkable method of discrimination
they were divided into classes, the better
class being given back chairs on the plat-
form, and those of not so much account
going to the long rows of forms in front
of the infants.
The first assistant and another teacher
did the honors while a squad of bigger
boys escorted the parents from the front
gate. Just then a scout from in front of
the gate rushed in.
“They’re coming, sir! ”
The head hurried off through the door.
The cadet corps drawn up between the
gate and the front door as a guard of
honor now came smartly to attention.
A HUSHED expectancy fell upon the
multitude. Sounds of feet and
sounds of voices could be heard inside
the building. Mr. Goodman appeared in
the doorway with the Mayor, a portly
and majestic figure, with three very big
chins and a simply tremendous stomach.
Behind, in the easy tread of great ones,
came the district member and his lady,
the district inspector, the Minister for
Education, four local aldermen, an array
of clergymen, a host of ladies —not over-
young and often unelassifiable—two lay-
preachers, venerable, tall, straight and
thin, and obviously, even to the youngest
child present, with the Divine Word more
firmly and thunderously in their keeping
than any mere parson could have.
In the dim light of the room, as in that
apparition’s glass in Macbeth, could be
seen many more.
Mr. Goodman walked with greatness
and chatted uneasily to it, and his mind
was clouded with doubts as to when to
give the signal for clapping. He felt it
should come as the visitors were moving
across the platform, but the wretched
doorway was so narrow that some were
already seated, some were moving across,
and some had not yet cleared the door-
way. A perfect skeleton with no teeth
and with a heavy stick doddered through
at this moment. He was the very first
boy enrolled at the school way back in
well, no one rightly knew when, but the
school was only a wooden shed then and
most of the suburb was bush.
Mr, Goodman assisted this interesting
relic who was to occupy a front chair,
and in doing so Mr. Goodman must have
inadvertently given the prearranged
signal for clapping. The skeleton, in his
innocence, thought the applause was for
himself, for vanity had outlived his
faculties. He smiled toothlessly, stamped
his heavy stick on the boards, and nodded
his head shakily and frequently. And
the children clapped, and the skeleton
nearly fell over in the excitement.
Mr. Goodman in agony gave the cease
signal, but it wasn’t quite the same as at
rehearsals. Patches of clapping continued,
and when these had very nearly ceased
it broke out again universally—like that
mysterious skirling of locusts in summer.
Mr. Goodman held up two hands like a
prophet invoking divine intervention, and
at the first lull loudly ordered the clap-
ping to stop. He had to do this in a
nicely-blended mixture of stern authority
and a deep affection for the children
under his charge.
The clapping stopped, and someone
waved his little flag, and then all the little
flags waved with the vigor of feelings
released. The skeleton thought the wav-
ing was for him, and that he had to
acknowledge it —which he did, almost to
his complete undoing.
AT last the flags were stilled, and all
were seated. Mr. McSporran, the
first assistant, was on the least reliable
and the most remote chair on the plat-
form. Scarcely less happily placed was
the headmistress of the girls, who foamed
in secret fury that she was denied a place
among the great ones.
There is a salutary exercise for youth
in gazing on greatness in the flesh;
apart from the skeleton, who had no
flesh at all, and the lay-preachers, who had
very little, there was plenty of flesh to
gaze at. Further, greatness is much im-
proved when it is displayed on a platform.
THE Mayor, who presided, rose from
behind the draping Union Jack and
beamed upon the small sea of faces —just
face in the mass. They were “dear girls
and boys,” and he was “ ’appy to be be-
fore them on this great and glorious
Hempire Day.” He wouldn’t say much
—he’d leave that to bothers, but he
couldn’t let this great and glorious hoc-
casion pass without saying ’ow ’appy he
was on account of seeing so many ’appy
boys and girls. Here it was revealed that
three of the aldermen had come along
in' the capacity of “Hear, hear!” men.
Now they said “Hear, hear” in turn, and
the skeleton, dimly aware of what it was
all about, clapped his hands. Then the
Minister perfunctorily clapped his hands ;
and the school, feeling it was the right
thing to do, clapped' vigorously. Mr.
Goodman could do nothing at all about
it, but the Mayor, who was a very decent
sort of man, enjoyed the clapping.
Then he introduced the Honorable
“Halbert ’Ockey,” the Minister for Edu-
cation.
The Hon. Albert Hockey arose amid
clapping that commenced on the plat-
form and spread like waves on the sea.
The Hon. Albert waited pleasantly and
impressively. He really looked like a
Minister for Education, and in himself
illustrated the advantages of education.
He spoke of Empire, going through it in
huge swathes that perhaps didn’t mean
much to the children, except that the
Empire was big. Yes, big. The sun
didn’t, in some way or other, ever set
on it, and Drake wasn’t a pirate—not
really—and they must keep on think-
ing of General Gordon at Khartoum.
He was the Ministerial father of all the
boys and girls present, and it was nice
to see so many flags.
Parliamentary government was a fine
thing, and the Eskimos still used bows
and arrows. And the Eskimos didn’t have
Parliament —as we understand it.

Various Verse
For My Grandfather.
When the ropes droop and loosen, and the gust
Piecemeal upon a widening quietness fails.
Fail breath and spirit; against the bony mast
Work in like skin the frayed and slackened sails.
In the green lull where ribs and keel lie wrecked.
Wrapped in the sodden, enigmatic sand.
Things that ache sunward, seaward, with him
locked,
Tug at the rigging of the dead ship-lover’s hand.
Though no gale lunges to this gulf, to fill
Drowned canvas with the steady bulge of breath,
Doubling for past, for future, are never still
The bones ambiguous with life and death.
Dusk over Bradley’s Head: a feeble gull
Whose sinking body is the past at edge
Of form and nothing: here the beautiful
Letona gybes, off the spray-shaken ledge.
As, for those years, dusk comes but as a rift
In the flesh of sunlight, closed by memory,
Shells stir in the pull of water, lift
Fragile and holy faces to the sky.
My years and yours are scrawled upon this air
Rapped by the gavel of my living breath.:
Rather than time upon my wrist I wear
The dial, the four quarters, of your death.
CANADA.
Francis Webb.
Whipping-boy.
The cliff’s a whipping-boy for the sea’s scourges,
On his scarred back taking the punishment
Of the cold ocean’s bitterest jealousy.
Sheltered beyond his eaten, furrowed hide
Prospers the prince decked out in brown and
green
Whose hills and valleys never feel the surges
Or the moon-mad excitement of the tide.
When in the pale sunrise the shadows are long
After a night of stillness, from the sea
The first thin shudders, the tentacles of air
Tease through the oily swell until a white
Lash curling and/ creeping, weaving along the
water
Strikes hard and true, a cruel and cunning thong
To find old cracking sores —a whip to bite
Salt into ancient wounds and make them smart.
Light soils grow lovely things, the cliff is bare
Save for the drowned sea-grapes upon the reef
Or the brief gulls, bright ornaments at rest.
Poised on the ledges watching for small fish.
Foam-ribbons to vanish before they bind his
heart —
These enemy’s presents are a transient jest.
There are cities beneath the sea, spires in the
water.
Kings lost with their ships, men, crowns and
songs —
Women, grown lovelier in the gallant stories
Spun on the land about the mystery
Of the oldest, hardest, the most incessant battle.
Listen to laughter, but cover the eyes of your
daughter,
Lead her away from the beach, she should not
see
Rock, splendidly angry, terrible, lonely.
Whose destiny is the land’s own life and promise,
Whose agony is that of the farm and the city.
Of the grey spider-web under a dry beam.
Of blown smoke from a house and roots feeding.
The beauties and strong loves of the prince are
only
The lost illusions behind a jealous dream.
N.S.W.
NANCY KEESING.
Mist.
Mist over my country, the sparrow’s chatter
Is still, the sun has gone behind the hill.
Plough-weary farmers trudge to the hidden
twilight
And the fat duck snaps an irritable bill.
Mist, in the fields, the corn is sullen, uncomely,
The crow calls from the hollow of grey ghosts,
Someone coughs, emptily, lonely, and fingers
Of shadow curl round hearts and paddock-posts.
Mist over my love, like doubt or sorrow.
And the moment has no solace. Slow and grave
The vision moves and earth instils the darkness
That elegies of love and sunshine have.
QUEENSLAND.
DAVID H. ROWBOTHAM.
The Barren Ground.
I think of it, that high, bare place in the
mountains,
Always under a cool grey blowing sky
Where the eagle hangs black and alone —clean
wind whistling
Through tussock and long low swell of scrub,
and through
Hollows the rainy centuries have worn
In the huge ruinous heaps of silent stone.
I trace on the map the way from the blue-edged
coast
Across green, where the rich farms lie, through
the deepening brown
That marks the rising ground, till the clear road
fades
And a broken track goes climbing on to that
space
Empty of all but the three words standing plain.
And I think I could lie down there, and be at
peace.
It was not named for a blue dog, a dead horse,
Nor for some dark tribe’s thought that haunts
the ear
And still eludes the brain; no bold explorer
Made record of his desperate journey there;
No settler left his name to cry when the bush
Has flowed back across the furrows and the
cold hearth.
When the fruit-trees have gone wild and the
children are scattered,
“By sorrow and sweat I was conqueror of this
earth.”
No, it was not named for glory or possession,
The foolish dreams of man, whose stiffening
hand
Lets the bright coin drop and follows it down
to dust,
But simply for itself —The Barren Ground.
How lovely its fall on the ear bewildered with
wo/ds.
On the mind sick with the eddies of thought,
for at last
The eyes are filled with the glitter of light on
the leaves.
With the million-petalled flowers, and can only
thirst —
Turning from life grown rank and smelling of
death — , ,
With a great thirst for the truth of barrenness.
For what is life, or what is death, who knows.
But all men know that peace is only peace.
Yet it may not be as I dream —three words on
the map
Are all my knowledge, and that I have seen as
well ,
Through a gap in the hills, rising far and
strange in the evening,
The darkening ramparts of its eastern wall.
But the heart has its own routes ana its
journeys’ ends, ..
And sooner or later strikes, though travelling
blind. .
The rocky track where the long road gives out
And comes on a grey day to its Barren Ground.
N.S.W.

Another “Caterpillar” Diesel Tractor unit with cable
controlled dozer filling in swamp. It is estimated that these
“Caterpillar” units will handle 750,000 cubic yards to
fill in this area.
WENTY-FOUR "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors are speeding the construction
ot the £5,000,000 Kingsford Smith Airport at Mascot, New South Wales,
shifting 9,000,000 yards of material at the rate of 25,000 to 30,000 tons per week.
Kingsford Smith Airport will be the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, covering
an area of approximately 2,000 acres, with runways up to 10,000 feet long and 300
feet wide to accommodate the world’s largest air liners.
The diversion of the Cook’s River into Botany Bay, one mile south of its present
outlet, by cutting a channel 600 feet wide by 24 feet deep and lh miles long,
calls for the moving of 2,500,000 yards of earth. The balance of the 9,000,000
yards of material to be moved will be made up in raising the ’drome level by 9 feet
and filling in the existing river. No less than 6,000,000 yards will come from
the dredging of Botany Bay and 500,000 yards from the nearby sand dunes. The
bulk of this work will be done by "Caterpillar” Diesel D 6, D 7, and D 8 Track-
Type Tractors wit}i cable-controlled Dozers, and No. 12 Diesel Motor Graders.
Operating in loose sand and on swampy ground under the most gruelling
conditions, the "Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors, with their rugged construction,
tremendous power and easy mobility, give the maximum of sustained traction
power, with the minimum of fuel consumption that makes "Caterpillar” a byword
for economy. Fitted with all-weather seals and filters that shut out the abrasive sand
and protect vital parts, replacements are reduced to the barest minimum.
To maintain the rate of excavation and increase output as the urgency of the job
demands, "Caterpillar” Diesel Traction and Earth-Moving Equipr»ent help speed
still one more national project to a successful conclusion, economically and on time!

ADDITIONS
ELECTING U.S. PRESIDENTS.
Judging by the amount of
space American newspapers give
to explaining how U.S. Presi-
dents are elected, even the
native-born must be a bit hazy
about the mystery which en-
tangles them every four years.
Admittedly, the thing is com-
plicated, but not quite as bad as
most of the explanations make it
appear.
For a start, those Wisconsin,
Nebraska, Ohio and where-are-
you “primaries” currently figur-
ing in cables: They are merely
Republican party preliminaries
and nothing more. They lead up
to the Republican party conven-
tion in June, when the Repub-
lican candidates for the Presi-
dency and Vice-Presidency will
be chosen. The other side, the
Democratic party, holds its con-
vention in July.
The respective party candi-
dates having been duly presented
by these conventions (or riots or
circuses, as they may be called
for the sake of variety and
greater accuracy), Americans at
large have till November to think
—and talk —it over. They then
elect, on a proportional basis,
the members of what is
called the “electoral college,” and
these do the actual, formal vot-
ing for President. All that this
voting method really amounts to,
however, is a delegating of vot-
ing power, since those thus
elected to the electoral college
are elected on strictly party lines
and vote accordingly. Hence,
as soon as the outcome of elect-
ing the electoral college is known
the choice of President is known,
and the electoral college voting
is a mere formal recording of
the people’s choice.
That is the whole mystery in
very simple outline.
One point of the widest pos-
sible interest is that when
Americans refer to their “Presi-
dential year” they mean every
minute of it. As Hitler under-
stood well enough, arid as
appears to be wefl understood
in the Kremlin now, a “Presi-
dential year” can have a parti-
ally paralysing effect on the
workings of American policy.
As far as America is concerned
—and that is a considerable dis-
tance these days—“ Presidential
year,” with practically all
American political decisions, in-
ternational and otherwise, con-
ditioned by it, is almost the
declaring of an open season for
aggressive acts and the like. The
whole American Government
machinery is geared for slow
working at any time, but with
the paralysis that creeps into it
every Presidential year it comes
close to a standstill, the speed
with which the European Re-
covery Programme was recently
put through Congress being a
remarkable, and a most signifi-
cant,. exception.
The actual Presidential-elec-
tion date is easy to keep in mind,
risually coinciding, as it does this
year, with the Melbourne Cup;
but whereas merely the first
Tuesday in November is con-
sidered near enough for the Aus-
tralian national event, the Ameri-
can is more meticulously set
down to take place always on
the first Tuesday after the first
Monday in November,
Without straining such asso-
ciations too far, it can also be
said that those “primaries” now
raising a hullabaloo in cables
from time to time are liable to
be as misleading as track gal-
lops before the Cup, They are,
as has been stated, purely party
affairs; the electing, on a fixed-
representational basis, of dele-
gates to the big party national
convention ahead.
Ostensibly these delegates are
usually pledged to vote at the
convention for the prospective
party Presidential candidates as
these may have figured in the
primary, but this does not
always happen. As a typical ex-
ample, the Wisconsin primary
gave Stassen 19 of the State’s
27 delegates to the Republican
convention in June, with Mac-
Arthur and Dewey the also-rans.
—Chicago “Daily News."
FISIN’S GOOD.
These three, however, are by no
means all the prospective Repub-
licans in the Presidential running
at this stage; there are also
Vandenberg, Warren and Taft,
at least; and the Wisconsin dele-
gates, When it comes to the spund
and fury of the June convention
and the final showdown there,
might switch to any of those.
In point of fact, Stassen him-
self, as a leading figure at the
1940 Republican convention.
made what amounted to a last-
minute, most surprising switch
in support of Willkie against
Dewey. As the writer of an
article on Stassen in “Harper’s”
some time ago reported that
switch: “Some Dewey people
have never forgiven Stassen for
what they call this doublecross ;
and some Minnesota politicians
have resented it ever since.” But
the doublecross is almost an in-
signe of these conventions,
At all events, the “primaries”
are no certain guides even as to
who the particular party’s choice
of candidate will be. In fact,
as “U.S. News-World Report”
recently put it, “History shows
that primaries have little influ-
ence upon the conventions that
pick the Presidential candidates.”
Certainly the primaries’ voting,
given rather undue prominence
in cables, should not be regarded
as at all a determining factor.
As the quoted publication adds:
“It never has been, in either
party. Sometimes the candidate
chosen by the convention is a
man who has not been entered in
any State primary The
primaries often turn out to be
simply popularity contests. A
bad showing in the primaries can
kill a man’s chances for nomina-
tion [e.g., MacArthur, the move-
ment for him having been
launched in Wisconsin, and the
support for him even there neg-
ligible]. But a clean sweep of
the primaries would not ensure
that he got in. Mr. Dewey went
into the 1940 convention at
Philadelphia with 203 delegates
he had won in primaries. But
Wendell Willkie, who had not
been a candidate in any primary,
won out.”
An important point to be
kept in mind regarding these
“primaries” is that they are held
in only some of the 48 States;
in the rest the party organi-
sation arranges the delegates for
the national convention. That is
ano ther of the various reasons
h th thp « •
„ p
ma f ies +K can , be pleading even
y l^ll krmt ed range that
IS> as indications of what the
P art Y choice of candidate at the
convention will be.
For instance, in “primaries”
h&d or being held this time —
New Hampshire, Wisconsin,
Nebraska, Ohio and Oregon;
the last two of these on May 4
and May 21 respectively—
neither Vandenberg nor Warren
figures, and these are agreed to
be, at this stage, two quite for-
midable prospects. As another
illustration, a N. Y. “Sun”
writer points out that Warren
will, anyway, go to the Phila-
delphia convention in June
“with the enthusiastic backing of
California’s 53 delegates,” and
much other support besides.
Even so, as a N. Y. “Times”
correspondent has it, “Political
campaign managers select Presi-
dential primaries contests for
their candidates [for the party
selection] with as much care
as a fight manager picks matches
for a budding protege.” The
whole reason for that careful
picking by the prospects’ man-
agers, and about the only result,
is that “victory in a primary
generates bandwagon sentiment,
while defeat can discourage
potential backers.” Or, as a
“Journal-American” writer has
commented on the current lot
of primaries, “Number of dele-
gates in all [the five named]
States put together isn’t import-
ant. Psychology is.” However,
the “psychology” would appear
to be largely of a negative kind:
that is, a prospect might be
killed off in the “primaries,” but
a really good showing in them
does not ever mean sure success
in the convention party selec-
tion.
So much for the “primaries” ;
strictly party affairs ; purely in
the nature of preliminaries to the
national party conventions ; sig-
nifying a little more than noth-
ing, but not very much more.
By all reports the national
party conventions, due to smite,
if not totally wreck, the welkin
in June and July, are the high-
spots of the entire Presidential-
year hullabaloo. As well as
doublecrosses there can be dead-
locks between supporters of the
more notable candidates, lead-
ing to unexpected choices
by way of compromise, and the
whole proceedings have often
been compared with Bedlam —
by flatterers, it is said.
At all events, the outcome of
the national conventions is that
each side \yill have set up its
Presidential candidate and his
Vice - Presidential team - mate.
And the entire business, from
these preliminaries to the final
actual voting for President, is
the very opposite from what the
framers of the American Con-
stitution contemplated as the
right and proper way to elect an
American President.
This rather remarkable de-
velopment is concisely and
clearly explained in an official
Congress document (1946 edi-
tion) on the nature of the Ameri-
can Government and how it
functions. “The framers of the
Constitution,” it statesi, “tried
to avoid having political parties
control the election of President.
They provided that each State
should choose as many electors
as it has Congressmen and
Senators... .These electors then
were to select the President and
Vice-President.”
In the first election (on those
lines) in 1789 there were no
parties because everybody turned
to Washington. He favored
Adams for Vice-President, so
Adams was chosen. The second
election in 1792 brought the
same result. But that original
idea of keeping the game clean
and free of party politics came
to an early end. The incident
leading directly to the formation
of political parties—and all the
fruit of that forbidden tree —
occurred in 1796, in which year
“The independent action of two
electors (when one from Virginia
and one from North Carolina
voted for Adams instead of Jef-
ferson, who was the choice of the
two States at large) brought two
lists of party candidates for elec-
tors in the next election.”
“Thus,” explains the Congress
document, “that provision of the
Constitution which was intended
to prevent political parties actu-
ally caused the formation of poli-
tical parties.”
This brings the account to that
apparently puzzling and rather
scattered institution the “elec-
toral college.” For the sake of
clearness, the term “electors,” as
to be now used here, means
those citizens elected by the
people at large to record their
votes for them, and the sum total
of these “electors” make up what
is known as the “electoral col-
lege.” What the framers of the
Constitution quite evidently had
in mind was a select lot of citi-
zens, appointed in all the States,
calmly and dispassionately
choosing the very best man in
sight for the very highest posi-
tion in American life. However,
as has been shown, party politics
got mixed into it, and ever since
those first early elections, instead
of the “electors” choosing the
Presidents, the “electors,” as the
Congress document puts it,
“have been little more than
puppets to register the vote of
the people of their State.”
Keeping in mind the special
meaning of “electors” in this
context, the Congress document
thus describes the “electoral col-
lege”: “The college comprises
the whole number of Presidential
electors —equal, in «ach State, to
the number of Senators and
Representatives to which the
State is entitled. They are the
persons actually voted for on
election day, who in turn meet
at their State capitals and vote
for President. No member of
Congress may be ‘appointed’
(that is, elected) to the electoral
college. In a few States ‘electors’
are bound by State law to vote
for the party choice for Presi-
dent ; but in most States their
vote for the party choice is
simply a matter of course.”
That, then, is about the sum
of it; and, with all due respect
to the framers of the American
Constitution, the “electoral col-
lege” as it has evolved, with the
“electors” simply the delegate
voters for the people at large,
seems to be at least on
thoroughly democratic lines, not
overlooking the fact that
America is a republic.
Courage and Benes.
In a dispatch to “Wall-street
Journal,” Joseph E. Evans looks
into the puzzle of Benes’s posi-
tion in Czechoslovakia; his not
having even resigned, though
Masaryk suicided. Evans con-
cludes that it calls for “some ex-
amination of the question of
personal courage in our time.”
After examining other ex-
planations put forward, Evans
finds' that what is most likely is
pimply that Benes is too broken,
weary and dispirited to act. “If
ever there was a tipie for
despair, it is now, and it is, to
judge from the accounts \)f
those recently there, the preva-
lent mood of Prague. The men
who literally hurled defiance at
the Nazi occupiers approach the
present nightmare listlessly.
They will do what they can,
certainly, but what they do will
be done without hope.”
Mixing with their exiles —the
few that got away to Germany
—Evans reports that “the people

business of resisting the Nazis
only to face this three years
later are asking themselves if
the struggle is worth it. If
totalitarian Communism is
finally overthrown, does that of
itself guarantee the advent of
freedom and peace?” He adds:
“Whatever is going on in the
mind of Benes, there is little
doubt that considerations of this
sort are numbing the efforts of
other future opposition leaders
in and out of Czechoslovakia.
They find it difficult to pour
their full energy into a struggle
the final outcome of which is
necessarily so uncertain.... It is
scarcely to be wondered if for
such people considerations of
family, personal security and
comfort sometimes take on an
aspect more urgently appealing
than the magnificent, but desper-
ately remote, cause of human
freedom.
“This is not to deprecate the
efforts of the embryonic and at
present chaotic Czech resistance.
Those who have fled, taking
with them little but the unbear-
able knowledge that they have
left wives and families to the
mercy of the Minister of In-
terior, and those miserable ones
stuck in Prague, have already
shown courage, and there will be
many more evidences of indi-
vidual courage before this matter
is finished.
“It is only to suggest that men
who willingly risked death fight-
ing tyranny once can find that
the second time it is demanded
of them the decision is more
complicated.”
Africa Booming.
Those like Chicago
“Tribune,” for instance—cheer-
fully writing J. Bull’s obituary
may one day be rubbing their
eyes astonished to find him going
stronger than ever. He may have
changed a bit, but there will be
no mistaking the familiar figure ;
and some of the explanation will
be found in Africa.
One American observer, look-
ing to developments there, and
in Canada, Australia, New
Zealand and elsewhere, has con-
cluded that, far from being old,
J.B. and Co. have youth on their
side. In the American’s view,
the new set-up has taken on
a fresh lease of youngness,
with a greater future ahead than
that of any other world organisa-
tion, J.B. may be pulling out of
Palestine and the sector there-
abouts, and have given away
India, Burma and the line along
those parts, but a new strategic
shape has already emerged, with
Africa being solidly developed
as an important part of it.
There, states “U.S. News-
World Report,” a great build-up
is under way. “Things are boom-
ing. Money is pouring in to
speed production of raw
materials.” Military planning
enters into it, too —developments
linked with overall strategy, and
also the value of uranium, tin,
copper and other deposits.
Others besides J. 8., including
the U.S., are taking a hand in the
newly speeded-up development.
In a general survey the quoted
publication states that “Africa is
bustling with the biggest boom
in its history. New industries are
mushrooming. Old ones are ex-
panding. Dams, highways, rail-
ways and big mechanised farms
are being developed all over the
continent. More is coming.
Britain and her colonies alone
are to spend close to
$1,500,000,000 on development
and welfare projects in Africa
between now and 1956. Private
investors are pouring billions into
the Union of South Africa, the
Belgian Congo and other areas.”
In the Union of South Africa,
the survey adds, 3721 new com-
panies were formed last year,
with a capital of nearly
$400,000,000. In process of de-
velopment is a synthetic-oil in-
dustry that will use the country's
enormous coal deposits for raw
material. The Dominion’s steel
industry, which now produces
500,000 tons a year, is being ex-
panded, with the aim of making
South Africa self-sufficient in
steel by 1950.
Many of the new firms are
branches of U.S. companies or
have some U.S. money in them.
Americans have an ''estimated
$100,000,000 invested in South
Africa, and are putting more in
all the time.
The Belgian Congo is also on
the crest of a boom. Under an
agreement with Belgium, the
U.S. buys all the uranium the
Congo produces, and it is the
world’s biggest source of it.
General exports now are 40 per
cent, above the pre-war level by
volume, and are three times
greater in value ; largely copper,
tin, gold, palm oil, cotton,
diamonds and rubber. The U.S.
is one of the biggest takers, and
the dollars thus earned help to
make Belgium one of the few
prosperous countries in Europe.
“But more and more of the
profits are being ploughed back
into economic expansion in the
Congo itself.”
In Rhodesia deposits of coal,
iron and chrome are to be
opened up, and to provide
electric power for the develop-
ment a dam, “four times the size
of America’s Boulder Dam,” is
to be built at Kariba Gorge on
the Zambesi River. Present
plans call for the installation of
a 750,000-kilowatt power-station
and construction of a railway
linking with the main line from
Cape Town. The scheme, cost-
ing $92,000,000, will be financed
partly by the British Colonial
Office, partly by local resources.
The object is to industrialise an
area that eventually can support
millions of British emigrants.
In British West Africa “the
London and colonial Govern-
ments together are to invest a
quarter of a billion dollars in
the next eight years.” It will be
spent for improving agriculture,
transportation, health conditions
and education. In addition,
“private interests are putting
$148,000,000 into economic de-
velopment,” In one of the West
African colonies, the Gold
Coast, a corporation is being or-
ganised to foster new industry.
“Purpose of these outlays is to
increase production of such com-
modities as cocoa, cotton, vege-
table oils, tin, peanuts and
diamonds. All of these things
can find a good market in
Britain. And what’s left over
can be sold in -America for
badly-needed dollars.”
In East Africa “the British are
putting $100,000,000 into a single
venture —a vast, mechanised
farm, largest in the world. Even-
tually it is to cover 3,250,000
acres. The intention is to pro-
duce large quantities of peanut
oil; within five years, the project
is expected to be in full produc-
tion, raising 600,000 tons of
peanuts a year. More than 100
miles of railway line will be built
to give the new plantation an
outlet to the coast, where a port
is being improved to handle
larger ships.”
The “U.S. News - World
Report” points out that what
makes all this activity important
is the new strategic value of
Africa. “The continent figures
heavily in military planning of
Britain and the U.S., both as a
storehouse of war materials and
as a potential fortress against the
Russians. If Russia should
spread out across Europe, Africa
would become the big U.S. base,
the jumping-off place for a
counter-attack. The Mediter-
ranean, along Africa’s northern

coast, is the avenue through
which the U.S. would move to
get at the Soviet Union.
“In case of war, or serious
threat of war, the U.S. and
Britain could move into a series
of partially-prepared positions
in Africa and begin tapping its
rich sources of strategic
materials. The British now
occupy all of Italy’s former
colonies which flank the vital
waterway through the Mediter-
ranean, the Suez and the Red
Sea. They still have powerful
naval and air bases in the Medi-
terranean, and are building up a
big military supply base in
Kenya, East Africa.
“The U.S. quietly has built up
an outpost in Liberia ; has spent
$25,000,000 in harbor and air-
port development there. The
U.S. Government also is furnish-
ing money to complete a high-
way from Monrovia, the capital,
to the border of French West
Africa. If trouble breaks out in
Europe, Monrovia’s new harbor
automatically becomes a U.S.
naval base. Roberts Field, a
$6,000,000 air-base built by the
U.S. 50 miles inland, then would
go into action as a way station
for planes bound for the Middle
East.
“Air-bases built by the British
and Americans during the war
could be put back into service
quickly, too. The U.S. has re-
opened one war-time base in
Libya, near Tripoli. From it
bombers could reach all the
trouble spots of Europe and
strike deep inside Russia. Bases
equipped to handle big bombers
could be put back into service
in Saudi Arabia and Eritrea.”
The survey concludes: “It
all adds up to a big concentra-
tion of activity in Africa.”

enough, neither pretender nor Franco
has been very keen about our in-
trigue.”

Wallace Aiding Truman. When
Henry A. Wallace threw his hat into
the U.S. Presidential ring Republicans
applauded, feeling that the only one
he could hurt would be Truman. In
N. Y. “Sun” David Lawrence has
argued, however, that “in the end,
the Wallace movement will help the
Democrats.” The Wallace programme
was likely to be interpreted as merely
a difference of opinion on how to
deal with Russia, a subject on which
the vast majority of Americans side
with Truman and Marshall. “Ihe
Wallace movement,” Lawrence fore-
cast, “will peter out by the time
election rolls around. It has neither
the money nor the popular backing
to make a sustained campaign, and
there is always the chance that Russia
may complicate Wallace’s efforts by
growing more instead of less un-
co-operative and more instead of less
aggressive in the various parts of the
Far East and Europe where tension
already exists.” Russia is certainly
doing its best on those lines to help
the prophecy.

The Berlin Squeeze. —The stand of
the British and American authorities
in Berlin, is based on the statute for
the four-Power occupation of the
city, the result of an agreement made
in 1944. It antedates the agreement
on four-Power machinery for the con-
trol of Germany, a juridical point
which the U.S.-British have insisted
would be firmly maintained. The
stand has repeatedly been affirmed,
as in U.S. General Clay’s words:
“We came into Berlin by right, and
we have every intention of staying.”
As London “Times” Berlin correspon-
dent sums up: “A Western with-
drawal would be a blow both to
Allied prestige and German morale,
for now mote than ever Berlin has
become for Germans in all parts of
Germany a symbol of national unity.
Nor would the Western Allies willingly
abandon those democratic forces —
the Social Democrats, the Christian
Democrats, and the Liberal Demo-
crats —who have shown much courage
in resisting the submersion of at least
part of their organisations in the
Russian system.”

The Precarious £. Arguing that
devaluing the £ may be inescapable
and might be helpful in Britain’s
recovery, “Saturday Evening Post”
contends that the real reason it hasn’t
already happened is not that given by
the British Government, that devalua-
tion would cause hardship by making
necessary imports cost more, but that
the keystone in the arch of Socialist
planning is control of the currency:
“If the Socialist programme for ‘full
employment,’ complete social services
and other expensive operations causes
distrust in the national currency, that
distrust must not be permitted to be
reflected in a free market. ‘Planning’
for a people dependent every day on
foreign food and raw materials is
a risky business. Wh6n a Govern-
ment-controlled grain authority buys
wheat, the growers of the world hold
out for the top price, and usually
get it. The benefits arising from dis-
tribution of risk among a thousand
traders and growers’ agents with vary-
ing hunches and opinions are lost, and
the pound sterling takes another
wallop.” The “Post” expects that the
French revaluation of the franc will
eventually dictate a similar course in
Britain, which “cannot indefinitely
sanctify a certain ratio between the
dollar and the pound long after the
ratio has ceased to be recognised by
the free market.”

Palestine Test. Terse review of
the present Palestine position by “U.S.
News-World Report”: “Jews and
Arab's are going to be left to fight it
out in the Holy Land. That is the
result of the latest shift of American
policy on Palestine. Idea is that a
brief test of strength between Jews
and Arabs might do more to clear up
the mess in Palestine than would in-
terference by third parties. Both sides,
it is thought, may be more willing
to talk peace after they get some of
the shooting out of their systems.”
* * * *
War Discounted. As London
“Economist” sees the “cold-war”
situation; “The American objective
is all aid —short of war ; the Russian
objective is all mischief —short of
war Months must pass yet before
all aid short of war is at grips with
all mischief short of war.” But mean-
while, it adds; “To imagine that the
leaders of Russia, with the ambitions
that they have for their own people
and their neighbors, would at this
stage either risk war or negotiate a
settlement with America, is to mis-
understand the essential qualities of
Russian policy—-its infinite patience,
deviousness, flexibility and realism.
Why should they abandon the in-
expensive and indirect method of
attack by Communist parties for
methods of warfare in which America
and Britain hold clear technical ad-
vantages? They have had a long
and impressive run of success. They
can well afford to wait, and, if neces-
sary, to relax.”

Before Commonwealth 4 Senators dis-
persed for another of their frequent rests,
the leader of the Opposition (of three,
leader included) implored the “Govern-
ment” to give them something to do. He
pointed out that they had “come great
distances to attend this brief session,”
and were in danger of going blue-mouldy
for want of occupation.
Senator Courtice, Keane’s successor,
promised to carry the protest to the Prime
Minister and ask that worthy to “see
what can be done.” He did not mention
that his “Government” and party had
decided to appoint 24 more Senators — if
they could.
Senators were not summoned to meet
during the February-March sittings of the
House. There was nothing for them on
the business-paper. Their “work” during
the “brief session” of which Senator
Cooper complained was summarised by
the Sydney “Telegraph” in these terms:
Senators spent two hours on Wednesday,
April 7, bringing 14 Customs and Excise
bills —bills implementing the Geneva Trade
Agreement—to the second-reading stage.
On Thursday, April 8, they passed 11 of
the bills without amendment, and debated
the agreement on the twelfth bill. On Fri-
day, April 9, they passed the remaining
three bills without amendment and ad-
journed:—to April 28 —an hour after lunch.
Eighteen of the 36 Senators—Senator
Cooper and his two associates from
Queensland and 15 “Labor” nominees
from other States —were successful at
the polls on September 28, 1946. The
new members (11) qualified to take their
seats on July 1, 1947; the terms of the
re-elected Senators are continuous till
June 30, 1953. All hands, who on the
hustings had given the silence of consent
to salaries of £lOOO p.a., saw them raised
to £l5OO p.a. before they were sum-
moned to Canberra. But that wasn’t till
October 15, and the “business”
swearing-in of 18 Senators, election of
President, naming of the Opposition-
leader, Deputy-leader and Whip, condol-
ences, questions and answers, tabling of
papers and reports —lasted three hours
five minutes.
. There followed sittings on October
16 (five hours 27 minutes, includ-
ing 25 minutes of Senator Amour, giving
an account of his world excursion and
his version of why he had been put off the
plane at San Francisco), on October 17
(two hours less seven minutes), and on
October 22. Exceptional, that one —it
began at 3 p.m. and, with two hours off
for refreshments, went on till 11.27 p.m.
Then came “deliberations,” interspersed
with questions and the like, for five hours
36 minutes on October 23 and four and
three-quarter hours on October 24, where-
upon the Chamber adjourned for just on
a month. On November 20, when the
proceedings were prolonged by recitations
(Burns, Hood, Mrs. Browning and
William Morris) volunteered by Senator
Grant, the distinguished author of
Through Six Jails, the Senate was occu-
pied, exclusive of meal-times, for four
hours 10 minutes. There ensued sittings
of four hours 37 minutes on November
21, an “all-nighter” on November 24-25
(seven hours 17 minutes in the first spasm
and six hours 29 minutes in the second,
stoppages for recruiting of flagging
powers excluded), three hours 35 minutes
on November 26, three hours 38 minutes
on November 27, a whole hour (10 30
a.m. to 11.30 a.m.) on November 28, six
hours three minutes on December 3 and
seven hours 11 minutes on December 4,
when 19 bills were “reviewed.” Then the
adjournment “for Christmas” and Easter.
And, according to “Labor/’ 24 more
Senators, at £l5OO p.a. apiece, are needed
for the discharge of such “duties.” What
a legalised swindle it will be if “Labor”
brings it off! And what a legalised
swindle if “Labor,” in affected fidelity
to the Constitution, two sections of
which it is ignoring, adds 47 seats (48 if
the Canberra public servants are to have
a member) to the 75 now in the House!
Tasmania’s small and almost stationary
population (227,000 in 1933, 257,000 in
1947) doesn’t entitle it to more than its
original number of Ms.H.R. So there
will continue to be five- members from
Tasmania, and there are to be 10 Sena-
tors. A perfectly idiotic arrangement, un-
matched in every part of the English-
speaking world where the bicameral
system exists.
None of the States of the American
Union —13 at the beginning, 40 in 1888,
48 since 1912 —has ever had or probably
ever will have more than two Sena-
tors. In the House, however, New
York has 45 members, Pennsylvania
33, Illinois 26, Ohio and California
23 apiece and Texas 21. The total
is 435, and it has been that for
many years. If “Labor” has its way Aus-
tralia, with roughly one-twentieth of the
population of the United States, will
have more than a fourth the number of
U.S, Ms.H.R. and nearly two-thirds the
number of U.S. Senators. And, unlike
our Parliament, which never debates
foreign affairs except when the “Gov-
ernment” chooses to permit a debate,
and that is seldom, the Congressmen have
world as well as national matters to attend
to, and they attend to them pretty well.
Excluding Tasmania so as to make out
a plausible case. Dr. Evatt pleaded that
“each member at the end of the present
Parliament would represent about 65,000
electors, but if the number of [full vot-
ing] members were increased to 121 each
would represent about 40,000 electors.”
Why, “the population of the average
Congressional district” (i.e„ constituency)
“under the 1940 census is approximately
304,000” (“Our American Government,”
with which the Attorney-General should
be familiar). And in the voting for
Senators in 1946 (and voting was optional,
hence a long way below the Australian
proportion) successful candidates, one in
each State, polled 2,559,363 in New
York, 1,853,458 in Pennsylvania,
1,428,067 in California, 1,275,774 in
Ohio, 1,085,570 in Michigan (Senator
Vandenburg), 989,736 in Massachusetts
(Senator Lodge), 799,808 in New Jersey
and 572,556 in the President’s State of
Missouri. How ridiculous this makes Dr.
Evatt’s objection that the present Sena-
tors, who meet so seldom and do so
little, have too many electors to look
after; “one for each 132,787”!
The cost of 82 new politicians in Par-
liamentary salaries alone would be
£123,000 p.a. (£11,500 more than the
salaries drawn by 111 members of both
Chambers in 1939-40), and at least
double that amount would be charged
up to the people for their transport, post-
age, reporting, printing, secretarial work,
committee fees and traveling expenses,
city offices, club and library privileges
and the rest. Cost is not the most cogent
argument against the “Labor” scheme
(“scheme” is right), but it is a considera-
tion in a country which, with a popula-
tion of 7,600,000 and comparatively few
industries, already has 609 politicians, 80
of whom are Ministers, each with a per-
sonal staff, and nearly 600,000 public
employees, and many of whose taxpayers
are finding their burdens greater than
they can bear.
Ten Senators from Tasmania! None
from New England or the Riverina, each
with far more inhabitants than Tas-
mania, and none likely. All the present
Senators fromJN. S. Wales and nearly
all those from the other States are city
persons, and it would be much the same
were the number increased to 60, with
terms shortened in some cases and
lengthened in others in attempted repudi-
ation of the constitutional requirement of
six-year terms in all cases except after a
double dissolution. “Labor” won’t get
away with this attempted repudiation.
Nor will it get away with its plan for
giving N. S. Wales 57 members out of 181.
There can be no increase of members
involving arbitrary alteration of Senators’
terms without a ratifying referendum.
There should be none without the forma-
tion of new States, at least two out of
N. S. Wales and one or two out of Queens-
land ; in effect, counterparts of North
Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and
Washington (formed in 1889), Idaho and
Wyoming (1890), Utah (1896), Oklahoma
(1907), Arizona and New Mexico (1912),
which have strengthened the Union in
many ways, and have become—as
Riverina, New England and Central
Queensland could become bulwarks
against the Communist conspiracy
centred in the Big Cities. What the Can-
berra “Government” proposes is rotten
in conception and would be rotten in
practice. It is a low “Labor” intrigue.
Scotched, Not Killed.
Voting at the Italian elections obviously
decided much more than the complexion
of the party to govern the “Democratic
Republic founded on work” which was
proclaimed by the Constituent Assembly
in Rome just before last Christmas. The
fortunes that De Gasperi’s Christian
Democrat party carried with it included
those of: —
The Marshall Plan, on which this was the
first popular vote among the nations pro-
posing to adhere to it.
Western European co-operation, in which
Italy is an essential participant if only
because she possesses the one pool of sur-
plus labor west of the Iron Curtain.
The prospects of survival of free demo-
cratic government in Austria and perhaps
also in France.
The Western Allies’ controlling influence
in the Mediterranean.
The elections provided for Moscow,
through the Soviet’s fifth-column in Italy,
a test whether Russian aggression could
hope to make any advance in European
democracies through the constitutional
means therein provided, or whether for
the future such advance must depend on
use of force. The Soviet gang’s methods
in most of the central European States
• brought under its dictatorship were to
form alliance with the local Socialist
parties, corrupt them from within and
“purge” the resultant fractions, and so
obtain absolute power for the extension
of the Bolshevik dictatorship. The Mlian
elections are saluted as the first repulse
of Russian aggression in Europe.
These issues were all defined before
polling-day, and so closely were the chief
Powers interested in the result that in the
estimation of the world at large the real
victory must go either to the United
States or to Russia. For weeks before
the elections the efforts among Italy’s
late enemies to bid against each other for
the favor of the Italian people’s decision
were, on the face of them, laughable.
Trieste, return of the small region in the
Maritime Alps transferred to France, the
promise of dollar relief-loans, even a
reconsideration of the disposal of some
of the late Mussolini’s African colonies,
were all thrown into the bidding from the
West. At some discount on scores of
delay, sincerity and quality, Moscow
competed with offers of relaxation of
reparation demands and the provision of
grain shipments. The spectacle of the
democracies offering, to a State which
was the most unrelenting partner in the
anti-Comintern Pact, heaped-up gifts as
an inducement to it to refrain from em-
bracing the Comintern (or Cominform)
was matched only by the companion-
picture of Moscow’s fifth-column in Italy
performing all the ritual of belief in an
election by proportional representation.
The factors combining to build up
defeated Italy’s importance in Europe’s
present condition were quite fortuitous.
Neither the United States, as sponsor
for the European Recovery Pro-
gramme, nor the 16 States (Italy being
one) which in Western Europe have
pledged themselves to implement that!
programme, could afford to have the
whole scheme jeopardised by the passing
of Italy under the Communist yoke.
A Communist victory at the Italian
polls would probably have encouraged a
coup d’etat by Communists in Austria and
“"discouraged the national efforts for re-
covery in France. It would have
opened the way for Russia to
move into a commanding position
in the Mediterranean. Neither with
the American public nor with the
American Government could the disposi-
tion to “save Europe from itself” be ex-
pected for long to survive the deliberate
desertion by Italy (as it would have been
construed) of all her racial and economic
ties with America —that second home for
generations of Italian emigrants. Indeed,
Italy itself would have been plunged into
a civil war, with undoing of all the work
of the Risorgimento; Britain and
America would almost certainly have re-
created Sicily—perhaps the Two Sicilies
—as an independent State. The Pope, it
had been hinted, might be obliged to
move from Rome, and in Spain Franco
seemed to be preparing to qualify for the
honor of host.
Apart from these elements of high
strategy in what the Russians call “chess
without vodka” and the Americans “the
cold war,” the Italian elections add one
more meed of testimony in affirmation of
the stupidity of all Socialists. In most
European countries the Socialist party —•
“Labor” it calls itself in Britain and
Australia —has been watching with the
fascination of a hypnotised rabbit the un-
winding of the Communist python.
Theoretically this Socialist party, of
numbers augmented from the wrack of
total war, could in most post-war demo-
cracies form the Parliamentary core of
some stable Government. In practice it
is distracted by every straw that turns
in the wind, by every malcontent who
derides its conservatism (covered as that
is with only the thinnest of skins), and by
every extremist who courts publicity by
threatening to join the Communists. In
one State after another on the Soviets’
borders the Communists, aided by
Russia, have mopped up the Socialist-
“ Labor” party, however strong it was on
paper, by either swallowing it whole or
first terrorising it into fragmentation.
The real significance of what had hap-
pened in all the Danubian States under
the occupation of the Red Army ap-
peared in full light with the fate meted
out by the Communist minority in
Czechoslovakia to the Socialists, whose
leaders had been cajoled, bribed, black-
mailed, or somehow “persuaded” into
forming with them a “unity bloc.”
That was what the despicable Fierlinger
did in Prague and the equally despicable
Nenni did in Italy last January. On the
question of joining the Communists the
Italian Socialist party (fortunately for
Italy) split in two, and the smaller portion
(but still considerable) formed the
“Socialist Unity” party under Signor
Saragat, supported by official “Labor” or
Socialist parties in Britain and Western
Europe. These are the “Right-wing
Socialists” who are expected to reinforce
the authority of De Gasperi’s majority
party in Parliament and the Cabinet.
Even within the rump of the old
Socialist party that Communist fellow-
traveller Nenni had a third of the voting
strength against him on a resolution to
run joint lists of candidates with the Com-
munists in what was called “the Popular
Front.” How many of the votes cast for
that bloc actually represented Communist
votes has yet to be computed.
The debacle of the Socialists was
richly deserved, and is a lesson for every
British democracy where “Labor”
tolerates the Communists in its midst,
connives at their revolutionary doctrine,
and represents them (like Mr. Chifley
does) as merely a party with a “philo-
sophy” which “Labor” ought to be able
(even if it can’t) to accommodate without
question. Between the persistent and
bloody Communist riots in most Italian
towns as a forerunner of the elections
and the Communist-led nine-weeks strike
in Queensland aimed at overthrowing the
Queensland Government there was a dif-
ference only in the weapons used.
In this country Mr. Chifley and Dr.
Evatt are flirting with the same enemies
of democracy, and leading their party
towards the same fate as has visited
the Hungarian, the Czech and the
Italian Socialists. Each of those parties
had a fair chance in their country to
stand by the principles they professed.
Each was betrayed to the Communists,
and with them their country into servi-
tude or (as in Italy) into great peril.
The First of May.
One of the outcomes of the Queensland
railway strike has been that the Hanlon
Government has decided not to take part
in the Brisbane May Day procession
this year—for over 30 years the leader of
the Queensland Parliamentary Labor
party has headed it. Mr, Hanlon says he
understands the demonstration will be
purely a Communist one> Five unions,
including the powerful A.W.U., have also
banned the march, and Government de-
partments, whose displays have for years
been a feature of the day, won’t be in
it either.
The decision is forthright and sensible.
The May Day stunt arose out of a meet-
ing of the Second Socialist International
in Paris in 1889, when the first day of
May was selected for annual international
celebrations symbolising the “brotherhood
of man and working-class solidarity.” In
Europe the event hais traditionally been
a day of broken windows and broken
heads; in British countries processions
followed by soap-box oratory have
usually marked it.
After the Russian revolution May Day
took on greater significance. The Soviet
made it an official holiday, and through-
out the world Communists and fellow-
travellers set out to make the day their
own'. For years the day has been a
Commo festival in Australia, complete
with Communist slogans, hammer-and-
sickle flags, anti-Australian and , pro-
Russian propaganda. Last year in Sydney
members of the Communist party
marched as virtually a uniformed army,
with embryo commissars barking at them
to keep in step.
Also in the procession was Federal
Minister Ward, never far out of touch
with Communist policy. In the Domain
he favored the marchers with a typical
Wardian tirade which, polished a little
and brought up to date, he was able to
use once again in the External Affairs
debate at Canberra a fortnight ago. It’s
a safe bet he’ll be in the march again this
year and that, given the slightest encour-
agement, he will unleash the same speech
again.
Last year the Communist party and its
fellow-travellers almost scooped the pool
when the judges—the May Day mooch is
organised by the N.S.W. Trades and
Labor Council —announced the prize-
winners. That may be what is behind the
council’s reported decision “to censor
rigorously all slogans, placards and
posters” in this year’s procession, and to
refuse the Communists permission to
march as a party. A feeble decision, and
it probably means as little as previous
gestures made by the same body against
the comrades. The Reds will still turn
out in force as members of the trade-
unions they control, under the nominal
guidance of the Trades and Labor
Council. They will be there, and so
will their slogans and their hammer-and-
sickle flags, and if in the spate of oratory
that will blast the Sunday-afteraoon calm
of the Domain known Communists aren t
heard speaking from the same platform
as Trades and Labor Council men, the
Moreton Bay fig-trees will probably col-
lapse from the shock.


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Referendum Ramp.
Most electors had received by last week
the pamphlet setting out the case for and
against the Appeal of the Government
in the coming referendum for the grant-
ing of permanent control by Canberra
of all Australian prices and rents.
Before the business of distortion begins
from the Socialist platform —as this
pamphlet indicates —the public may as
well be advised on certain essential facts
about which this dictator-minded Govern-
ment at Canberra will certainly not en-
lighten them. i.
Firstly, the British Socialist Government
recently issued a White Paper on this
very question of inflation and price-
control as demonstrated by their own ex-
perience (more serious than ours). In
that report it said:
The Government now sees that its
economic controls are not proof against
strong inflationary pressure. Too much
faith is still reposed in price-control.
Mr, Chifley says that inflationary pres-
sures make continuance of price-control
necessary. He is answered by Mr. Colin
Clark, director of the Bureau of Indus-
try in Queensland, than whom there is
no more respected authority in this coun-
try on economic trends. Mr. Clark’s ex-
amination of price-controls during the
past 16 years has been made on the spot
in Britain and America as well as in
Australia. He wrote on January 4 last,
after his return from overseas:
Exchange-control, price-control and wage-
control are not the way to check inflation;
they are merely the way to check produc-
tion. The main cause of inflation and of
rising prices is lack of production, and the
main factors holding back production in
Australia, as in other countries, are excess
taxation and unnecessary controls Under
high taxation, when everybody is trying to
spend money and no one is making any
real effort to increase production, there is
inflationary pressure, and controls become
worse than futile because they are breed-
ing a general contempt for the law. The
best form of price-control is competition.
Secondly, Mr. Chifley says the States
cannot do the job and have declined to
do it. Against this should be set the
statements of Premier McGirr (N.S.W.)
on Dec. 8 last:
Mr. Chifley said last week that the Com-
monwealth Government was seeking price-
control powers because all the States were
not prepared to control prices. The N.S.W.
Government will fix prices within the State
if the Commonwealth referendum is not
passed The State Premiers agreed in
1946 that the States should fix prices where
the Commonwealth could not do so.
And Premier Hollway, of Victoria (the
State Chifley was. really hitting at), de-
clared on December 4:
State control of rents will be continued
when Federal control ceases. The State
fair-rents courts had functioned satisfac-
torily until superseded during the war by
Commonwealth (emergency) legislation.
Should the Federal referendum be negatived
the State will review the position.
All the other State Premiers have given
the same assurances. Actually during
the control period rent-control by the
States in S.A. and W.A, has been more
successful than by the Commonwealth
elsewhere. The States have no need to
act hastily to meet any imminent change
if the referendum is not carried. Com-
monwealth temporary controls will en-
dure fpr the remainder of this year, any-
way, and can, if necessary, be further
extended temporarily for a further term.
Every party-leader in Federal and State
Parliaments knows this.
Visitors from Eire.
Mr. De Valera was due in Australia
yesterday after this page had gone to
the printer. He comes not at the invita-
tion of the Chifley Government, as Mr.
Chifley hastily explained, but at that of
Dr. Mannix, to attend the ceremonies
commemorating the hundredth year of
the Catholic see of Melbourne. But, ac-
cording to the Sydney “Daily Telegraph,”
he and his companion, Mr. Aiken, one
of his Ministers for many years, will try
to beat up Australian support for the
ending of partition in Ireland, having in
a tour of the U.S-A. “repeatedly con-
demned Britain’s refusal to terminate
partition.”
Extremely embarrassing, for Our
Foreign Policy is committed to partition
in Palestine, though the U.S.A. has
abandoned it and though Britain, which
would never have a bar of the thing, is
pulling out fast. So it was announced at
“a special meeting of the U.N.O.
Assembly” last week by a Mr. John
Hood, who found it “hard to see how
the postponement of partition could
make a settlement any more likely,” and
intimated that “Australia” would decide
its course of “action” regardless of “stra-
tegical expediency, of power politics and
of groupings outside the spirit and proce-
dures of U.N.0.” Mr. John Hood was
eagerly supported by Mr, Carl August
Berendsen, from (not necessarily “for”)
New Zealand;. “If partition was right in
November it is right today; the circum-
stances have not changed in the slightest.”
Who Mr. John Hood is nobody but
Dr. Evatt seems to know. Mr. Berend-
sen is a “career diplomat” of sorts, hav-
ing begun as a junior clerk in a Welling-
ton department, being always careful to
polish up the handle of the office door.
They and their Administrations are now
basking in the favpr of the New York
“Post,” a Zionist paper owned by a Jewish
lady, which has published all Ben Hecht’s
incitements to and exultation in the bomb-
ings, shootings and hangings of Britons
by Jewish mutder gangs.
The “Post” was moved to delight by
“the Australian delegation’s action in
preparing a resolution asking the General
Assembly to permit the Palestine Com-
mission” (composed of a Czech, a Fili-
pino, a Panamanian, a Cuban and a
Dane, and without even a corporal’s
guard) “to proceed with the establish-
ment of an independent Jewish State.”
But if the proprietress or her husband,
who writes passionate Zionist leaders,
asked the partition zealots from the Anti-
podes whether, with Jews and Arabs
arrayed for mutual slaughter, Australia
will send 2000 troops to Palestine, and
New Zealand 500, to help in separating
the combatants and keep them separated,
she or he will see both gentlemen duck.
Mr, De Valera himself will see some
ducking if he requests Mr. Chifley and
Mr. McGirr to outline the measures they
have taken against the Communist con-
spiracy, and Dr. Evatt to explain why the

“delegation” he sent to the Freedom of
Information conference (all these shows
have high-sounding names), the “success”
of which he extolled, joined the Soviet
“delegation” in refusing to support a
United States resolution regretting the
absence of a Czech editor, a victim of the
Communist purge. But if he goes to
Queensland with questions in the same
challenging vein he will get a straight
answer from a man with a straight back.
In other words, from a fine specimen of
the fighting Irish who has earned the
respect .and gratitude of people of all
races and religions in the Common-
wealth by standing up to and smashing
the Communist blockade of Queensland
when those who should have helped him
(heads of “Governments,” themselves of
Irish origin but non-fighters where Com-
munists are concerned) bolted for safety.
Food and Friendship.
The impressive addresses of Sir Laurence
and Lady Olivier, heard in full by those
radio-listeners fortunate enough not to
be tuned-in to a “national” programme,
in their Anzac Day appeal for food-
parcels for Britain cut inspiringly
through the clammy atmosphere created
by the Wards, the Dedmans, the Laskis
and such around the British post-war
prospect. Unlike the shallow material-
ists of the Attlee and Chifley “Labor”
parties, the Oliviers recognised the British
spirit as an instrument in the Empire’s
greatness, and emphasised that the Old
Country is not down and out, but is “do-
ing what it is well to, as its history
shows—starting again.”
Sir Laurence said he hoped that any
gifts of food to Britain would be made
in a spirit of affection, and not from a
feeling of pity, which was almost the
same thing as contempt. A very neces-
sary condition if that part of the Empire
peopled by predominantly British stock
is to “start again” with a new conception
of what Empire ties mean; and it seems
that it is in closer integration of the com-
munities —the . families —constituting the
present British Commonwealth of Nations
that the future of the British race lies.
Indeed,, it is hard to feel pity for the
country which bore the brunt of the Ger-
man war for so long and so resolutely,
whatever its political and economic prob-
lems may be for the moment. Friend-
ship, affection and admiration there may
be in any quantity, but pity —never!
"Fixers."
There is nobody so simple as a scientist
when he strays off his beat. This was
recognised long before these days of
Leftist sentimentalism, when even
geniuses like Einstein and the daughter
of the Curies, herself a Nobel Prize-
winner, air their childlike ignorance of
matters of government. “Savants
and asses to the centre!” was the cry of
Napoleon’s army in Egypt when the
French squares were threatened with
Mameluke charges, and it put the soldiers
in excellent humor.
Queensland’s Dr. Jensen, who has done
excellent scientific work for Australia in
several fields, and, venturing into poli-
tics, was a thrice-defeated “Labor” can-
didate for the Senate —he deserved some-
thing easier—has written a booklet on
Dan Green, a behind-the-scenes charac-
ter of times past, and with the naivete
of his tribe has penned this paragraph:
Dan always seemed to have plenty of
money, though he seemed to have no defi-
nite occupation. He usually had a pocketful
of notes, and he lived up to his means.
He visited, and dined, entertaining people
in the Hotel Australia [Sydney] and the best
restaurants, and his flat was always well
supplied with the most expensive of eat-
ables and the finest of ales, wines and
spirits. His seeming lack of a definite job,
together with his apparent superfluity of
cash, made certain gossip-mongers suggest
that he was a crook.
Dr. Jensen denies the impeachment, but
other passages, particularly one in which
he describes how his Mr. Green “took a
camera and plates, skeleton-keys and
burglars’ tools,” and got “flashlight
photographs” of “a document” in a
solicitor’s office, support it. Dan was a
“fixer.” Not the first of his tribe, nor
did he escape detraction, nor did Puritans
seek his company, but he had a whale of
a good time and died in bed, bootless.
Dan flourished in an age before “con-
trols” came in. Under “controls,” “fixing”
has become a feature of “full employ-
ment.” Mr. Menzies, borrowing an
idea from The Bulletin, has said
that all the blackmarketeers will
vote Yes at the prices-and-charges
referendum; and so will all the
“fixers,” and “fixers” abound. If
“controls” go, and with them very remote
and unsuspecting control at Canberra,
the “fixers’ ” occupation, at least in many
cases, will be gone. In the dearth of
“prospects” such of the “fixers” as gradu-
ated from the harsh field of manual labor
will have to bid a long farewell to their
wine-chickeij-and-gjrl regimen and betake
themselves to their natural implement,
the pick.
A Remarkable Trust.
About 20 years ago Arthur Cunningham,
a North Queensland pastoralist, hit upon
an idea for assisting returned soldiers.
Now known as the Scartwater Trust, its
costs of administration would give a
Government auditor heart-failure.
Cunningham bequeathed Scartwater
Station, which now runs about 10,000 head
of cattle, to be conducted by a trust, the
income to be devoted to the assistance
of soldier-settlers and the higher educa-
tion of their brighter children. Head
trustees are E. Cunningham (son of the
founder), the Public Curator, the Bris-
bane manager of A.M.L. and F. Co.,
E. G. Lascelles (Proserpine), V, A. Toms
(Bowen) and F. R. North (Townsville).
They manage the station, and the N.Q.
district council of the R.S.S.A.I.L.A.
looks after the distribution of the funds.
In its first year the a trust got £lOOO
from the station, in 1946 it was £5OOO,
last year £6OOO. Loans to Diggers are
interest-free and the trust pays no income
tax. Over the years the Diggers have
faithfully repaid the advances, and last
year no less than £17,000 was loaned.
In the 20 years there have been re-
markably few failures of assisted men,
no man’s investment had ever been sold
up, actual receipts from Scartwater
totalled £31,500 and the trust had
advanced £59,130. Bad debts were only
5 p.c. for the 20 years and administration
costs but |d. in the £.
Educational assistance began with
scholarships for promising children, and
soon expanded to grants for good passes
in the junior and senior examinations. A
secondary student at home gets £26 a
, year, £52 if he or she has to leave home
to attend a secondary school. There are
no set numbers of scholarships, granting
of which depends upon the child’s stand-
ard and the trustees’ view of its chances in
higher education. Cunningham Scholar-
ships, which provide for a University
course, are set aside for the student from
the beginning. A medical student, for
instance, about to enter a six-year course
at £lOO a year has £6OO set aside for him
so that assistance is guaranteed to the
end of the course.
The founder of the trust was a pioneer
of North Queensland, a patriot and a
practical benefactor who didn’t live to
see the remarkable fulfilment of his
vision. It was his gift to his country
and the men who defended it in two
wars —though the second came after his
death —and it is also the lasting evidence
of his faith in North Queensland.
Century of Achievement.
The Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabitant joins
in:
At the instance of Mr. Heffron, the appro-
priate “Labor” Minister, N. S. Wales has in
various ways been celebrating its Centenary
of Public Education, so-called, though there
were schools in King’s time. Mr. Heffron
gave the go-ahead signal to the celebrators in
a Sunday-night speech from A.8.C., whose
principal topic on the Saturday, as it is at
all times that of the Sunday and daily papers—
themselves examples of Public Education and
its refining influences, and ever-active in the
cause of Giving the Public What It Wants,
whether it be strip-tease photography, astrology
or an old illiterate’s “cure” for cancer—was,
and always is on Saturdays, horseracing.
Tired punters and bookmakers awaiting
mental refreshment from Mr. Heffron nearly
had to go without it and take up the oft-read
racing-sheets agajn. For “sections of all
metropolitan areas supplied with power by the
County Council were blacked out between 5.3 U
p.m. and 6.30 p.m.” Fortunately Mr. Heffron
wasn’t to come on till 7.15, and by that time
Bunnerong was in action again and Mr. Heffron
was clearing his throat. If tired punters
and bookmakers noticed traces of agitation in
his address they may fairly attribute them to
the unsettling effects of reports from firemen
and police. Desiring to anticipate the cele-
brations with a bonfire, scholars had tried to
burn down the Erskineville Government school
by “setting fire to logs in the basement.”
Interrupted in this pastime as “flames began
to burn through the floor of the two-storied
infants’ section,” these sportive heirs to “the
foinest system in the world” bolted from “the
schoolyard,” one “ingeminating” the words
“Nit, here come the cops!”
That night the Director of the McGirr-Heffron
“Government’s” Lottery Department cast up
his accounts, presumably by way of doing a
little celebrating of his own. In a proud com-
munication to the papers, published when the
celebrations were fairly in their stride, he pre-
pared the McGirr-Heffrons and customers —in the
main, of course, products of Public Education,
whose thronging of the Lottery Office is one
of the Sights of Sydney, far surpassing those
to be seen in Dublin and in the capitals of
Latin American republics which acknowledge
Dr. Evatt as their Leader —for “record gross
profits of more than £2,000,000.”
By June 30, 183 ordinary lotteries with
a first prize of £6OOO and 19 or 20 special
lotteries with a first prize of £12,000 will
have been drawn.
From Los Angeles, however, came news of
a certain Arthur Herbert McKell, Vof Sydney,”
who could scarcely have been in a Heffron-
like mood. Failing in a mission to girdle the
once-heathen land of California with N.S.W.
Government lottery tickets —California has had
a constitutional veto on lotteries and all lottery
transactions for upwards of 60 years—he was
arrested on five charges and, offering no de-
fence to one, was remanded for sentence. And
as the Sydney “D.T.” had it, sentence might
be “two years’ jail or a fine of £312 or both;
or McKell may be granted probation and
deported.” Arthur Herbert is a cousin of
the McKell who contributed to Public Educa-
tion (“the ‘foinest system in the world”) by
setting up a racing club during the Japanese
war and was thereupon—though not necessarily
on that account —named Gee-Gee by Mr. Chifley.
“S. M. Herald,” the only paper published
throughout the hundred years, reported Mr.
Heffron and was on hand with recollections
and compliments. Unfortunately its centenary
article was flanked by a letter in which one
H. R. Littlemore morosely contrasted the
spectacle of “a complete new bar,” on which
“a host of workmen was flat-out in a city
hotel,” with that of “the Greenwich Govern-
ment school,” in which “children sit on the
floor because there are no chairs or desks,”
and the equipment includes “discarded huts,
unheated and entirely unfurnished.”
Granny herself, always the gentlewoman,
was a prey to concern “lest State education be

CARRERAS LTD. - OVER 150 YEARS’ REPUTATION FOR
given a political bias by certain left-wing mem-
bers of the Teachers’ Federation.”, A very lady-
like expression of “a legitimate fear.” The
Teachers’ Federation belongs to the Labor-
Council, and has never been known to fail
the Communists of that concern when they are
set on Oriental intolerance. For its own part,
the executive of the Teachers’ Federation
savagely boycotted the Workers’ Educational
Association because one of its lecturers re-
viewed the course of the Russian Revolution
without the required adoration and flunkey-
like abasement; and though years have elapsed
the boycott is still on. And its leader, Lewis,
was sent abroad as a missionary by the Com-
monwealth and State “Labor” Governments,
going to Mexico City (with dollars to burn)
in the first instance and then, Mr. Lang said
without denial, to Yugoslavia, where the Comm-
form and Tito Youth have ,their h.q. .fhis
Lewis was a twice-unsuccessful Communist can-
didate for Parliament.
So the centenary was an occasion for intro-
spection and heart-searching rather than re-
joicing. There are obvious flaws on “the
foinest system in the world.” Though the
curriculum seems. overloaded with other
subjects, there is a patent lack of instruction
in manners, in the anti-social stupidity and
sordidness of gambling, in the management of
the human voice, and in English literature, that
glory of the race and its sure prop and stay
in adversity for those cultivated to appreciate
it. For all their natural intelligence and attrac-
tive appearance—and they are assuredly excel-
lent material to work on—many N.S.W. b«pys
and girls speak very badly and have a distressing
paucity of interests in more enduring
things than sport, and too often are no
models of behavior in public places. No doubt
the deadly materialism of “Labor” and Com-
munism and the hate inculcated by both parties
are infecting even schoolkids. Certainly the
eradication of the Communist taint from the
teaching body is a pressing need.
POLITICAL POINTS
It looks as if Our Foreign Policy will
bait Fadden into calculating how many
millions it has cost, by way of feeding
the vanity of one (1) meddling politician,
and no one could do it better. Features
of a continuous performance which goes
from bad to worse:
We sided (1) with the Indonesians against
the Dutch; (2) with the Indians in South
Africa against the South Africans; (3) with
the Russians in South Korea against the
Americans; (4) with the Russians against
the British when the latter sought U.N.O.
suppport for the extension of Human
Rights, to which Dr. Evatt' gives so much
lip-service, to the forcibly-detained Russian
wives of Britons and Americans, and (5)
with the Russians when the British took
up the case of a “purged” Czech editpr.
We are now (6) siding with European
Jews in Palestine and, of course, with the
Russians (we always side with them) against
the* Arabs, who have the support of the
entire Moslem world.
Along with the everlasting crawl to
“Australian” Communists, which is no
secret anywhere, the “policy” is exposing
Australia to ridicule, hatred and con-
tempt.
Shops are stocked with clothing which
could be sold if coupon ratings were
reduced, or abolished in the case of
surplus goods, but this is not to be
allowed. Lamb is scarce, and will get
scarcer, so it has been “freed from Gov-
ernment control.” Referendum dodges
both, and dirty. Their authors feared
that clothing would be marked down
and hoped that lamb would be marked
up—though so far the rise has not ful-
filled their expectations.
Nothing could be feebler than Mc-
Girr’s Coogee-campaign speech for Mrs.
Cunningham, widow of the 1941-47
member, and as such guaranteed £3 a
week for life under “Labor’s” Legislative
Assembly Pensions Act. With the cheap
brag in which he indulges when he isn’t
crawling to Communists, McGirr declared
that the “ ‘Labor’ Government” has “built
more houses than were built by all pre-
vious Governments in this State” (it wasn’t
a “State” till 1900) “in more than a hun-
dred years.” If this is true, or moderately
true, it is only because nearly “all previ-
ous Governments” were content to leave
building to builders instead of handing
it over to bureaucrats in the idiotic
“Labor” fashion.
The Wallabies, as fine a lot of
fellows in appearance and every other
way as ever wore football togs, after
wearing the King’s uniform, had to play
their homecoming match on an over-
crowded and otherwise uncomfortable
r :burban ground. Their -Rugby Union
was refused the Sydney C.G., which is
given over to a “hundred per cent. ‘Labor’
concern” which pursues the oof bird,
offering, besides footbrawl, booze and bet-
ting. But beer has been “off” for months,
in consequence of a trumpery brewery
strike which Dr, Evatt’s very expensive
“streamlined arbitration” has egregiously
failed to settle. So the “hundred per
cent. ‘Labor’ ” show’s Cricket Ground
crowds have fallen away horribly.
Sydney’s aldermen have refused further
use of the city hall to the Oriental pollu-
tion known as Communism. Though
very tardy about it, they were unanimous
in the end.
Laurence Olivier’s manly and feeling
speech at Canberra in support of Food
for Britain was chopped off in mid-
sentence on the “national” network, just
as Menzies’s Referendum speech had
been chopped off in mid-sentence a few
nights earlier. A.B.C.’s excuse on the
second occasion was that the broadcast
had “not been expected to run more than
the allotted time” ; and it “regretted that
an error of judgment had been made.”
B-class stations guarded against such an
“error” by announcing before switching to
Canberra at 9.30 p.m. that the item to
follow the Oliviers would begin at
approximately 9.45. Their listeners beard
the broadcast in full.
Olivier hit “Out straight from the
shoulder in replying to the knockers and
croakers who have been speaking of
Britain as though she had become a fifth-
rate Power. He said that, much as the
people of Britain appreciated the food
parcels, if it were suggested that they were
sent merely in pity and in the belief that
Britain was done for, there would scarcely
be a man or woman in the U.K. who
would not say “Keep your parcels—
we’ll battle through on our own.” That
was not Olivier the actor speaking, but
the true voice of Britain. Most Aus-
tralians do not need the hint, but there
are a few —Federal Ministers among
them —who might well take note.
Although there has been stroiig Gallup-
poll condemnation of the juggling with
seats at Canberra, “Tory” papers, as Cal-
well jumped at the chance of mentioning,
acquiesced in the “Labor” job. But
Melbourne “Age,” generally friendly to
“Labor,” damns it with faint praise:
There is to be the anomaly of a piebald
Senate for three years, with 18 members
elected on the old bad style and 42 on
P.R. Of the latter, there is a messy classi-
fication of those eligible, and those not
eligible, to take seats immediately.
It is not only messy, but muzzy. And it
is sure to be challenged on constitutional
grounds if it comes off.
Having left a Canowindra collection
of its “homes for the people” unfinished
for many months, McGirr’s Housing
Commission wrote to Boree shire asking
when kerbing and guttering work would
begin. The shire council’s reception
of the letter had to be toned down for
publication.
If the “Labor” jobbery of Federal
seats goes through and an enlarged Par-
liament meets, at the risk of having all
its proceedings declared null and void,
N. S. Wales and Victoria will have 100
members between them —100 out of 181,
counting only those with full votes. Like
the plan for giving Tasmania twice as
many Senators as Ms.H.R., there is no-
thing like this in any other federated coun-
try. The two most populous American
States, New York and Pennsylvania, have
82 members in Congress: 47 and 35 re-
spectively, including two Senators apiece.
Any hope that the 1947 census would
show even a slight halt in the drift to the
cities has been shattered in South Aus-
tralia, where the census showed a drop
of 4579 in country population since 1933
| —and that despite the establishment of
Whyalla with its 8000 people. The
Adelaide population increased by 69,846.
Does Jimmy Larcombe ever recall that,
when M.L.A. for Keppel, he was an en-
thusiast for the division of Queensland
into three States? He supported a motion
to . that effect, moved by John Adamson
(afterwards a Senator) in the Assembly
on July 24, 1933, and “put the case for
the North” as leader of a deputation to
Theodore, then Premier, in September,
1922 ; a deputation from the Central
Queensland New State League. Forde
accompanied it, and so did Hartley, Dash,
Peterson, “Darby” Riordan, Barber,
Winstanley, Stopford, Bulcock and
Gillies, all “Labor” politicians. All are
either dead or out of politics, but Jimmy
remains—M.L.A. for Rockhampton and
Hanlon’s Treasurer. Central and North
Queensland suffered severely during the
recent Communist blockade, more
severely than South Queensland, and a
revival of the old zeal for subdivision
might have been expected in Jimmy’s
case. But he is as silent as those silenced
by death.
Apart from declared Communists, the
sickest crowd in Britain when the Italian-
election results came in must have been
the thirty or so “Labor” members who
whooped up the anticipated victory for
their side in a cheeky message to the
■Socialists swallowed by the Communists
of the “Popular Front.” At the head of
these too-clever fools was Platts-Mills, a
Rhodes scholar, turned lawyer-politician,
from New Zealand. Another ringleader
was that \yretched Moscow crawler
Zilliacus, born a Finn.
Britain is doing away with capital
punishment for a trial period of five years
—except for treason and sabotage. This
seems to be another case where Parlia-
ment is out of step with public opinion.
In a Gallup poll on the abolition of the
death penalty 69 per cent, of Britons
favored its retention, 24 per cent, advo-
cated life imprisonment and 7 per cent,
had no opinion. A similar poll has been
held in Australia, with results almost
identical; 67 in every hundred said
“Hang ’em,” 24 “Jail” and 9 “Dunno.”
Australian “Labor” Governments, of
course, are too yoomane to hang the
most brutal killer or the most monstrous
assailant of a helpless woman —three
frightful cases of rape have been heard
this last month in Sydney, where records
show that hanging is the only effectual
preventive and safeguard,
Sydney wharfies objected to a ship-
ment of sugar being sent to Tasmania:
“in view of the present shortage the
sugar should be distributed locally.”
Typical of the selfishness of the tribe,
whose creed is that no matter who else
goes short, they should not suffer. Typi-
cal, too, of the arrogance of the Commo
mob whose blockade of Queensland was
the immediate cause of the shortage.
Included among five British seamen
sentenced to jail and deportation as pro-
hibited immigrants was one John Healey.
Calwell, has issued a direction that “all sea-
men who desert their ships or offend
against the laws of Australia are to be
charged as prohibited immigrants.” If
the order were extended to include immi-
grant Communists who incite others to
desert their jobs and who otherwise offend
against the laws of Australia, there would
be at least two Healys on the way out,
one from the Brisbane Labor Council and
the other from the Waterside Workers’
Federation,
The last April division of the Chifley
Guff Stakes, in which two Sydney Sunday
papers are matched, saw (in their own
jargon) a “photo.-finish.” Room for the
“Sun”: —
I don’t think Chifley likes it; but it is
a fact that, for some years now, his fol-
lowers have likened him to America’s
famous backwoodsman President Abraham
Lincoln.
Surely the worst comparison in the world.
But the “Telegraph” “broke even” in its
lingo and fashion:
Chif. outwitted the Opposition and scotched
what would have been a bitter debate on
Menzies’s motion to censure Mulcahy for
the allegation he made....that Blain had
used his gold pass to get specialised treat-
ment from the Japs... .Labor members
, reckon that Chif.’s cunning has ended the
incident for good.
They “reckon” also that “Chif.” simul-
taneously dished Lang’s efforts to call
his “Government” to account for its
abject surrender to Communism. But
“cunning” is nearly right. In each case
it was low cunning associated with cold
feet.
A sort-of-a-kind of feeler about
another rise in fares on McGirr trams
and buses— 1 they’re losing another mil-
lion or so despite an all-round increase
last year—got into the Sydney papers.
Before the suffering public had time to
express its wrath somebody on the
“Labor” side remembered the imminence
of the Coogee by-election, whereupon
there was a rush to get denials in print
and over the air. But Coogee, with the
worst and dearest tram “service” in Aus-
tralia, will scarcely be kidded into accep-
ting them.
Names of Eire potentates are printed
in English and Gaelic. Except for
accents, De Valera’s is the same in both
languages. That of Frank Aiken,
“Dev’s” companion on his Australian
journey, is, in Gaelic, Proinnsias Mac
Aodhagain. If Proinnsias had arnvea
when Arturdid O Augustus Calwellaign
was denouncing “Red Fascists” Arturoi
might have made a stab at. it, but Artu-
roid’s sentiments have changed and. nis
invective is now reserved for opponents.
On the Coal Cliff colliery the Com-
monwealth Government lost £121,700,
apparently in nine (9) months. _ On its
four power-alcohol distilleries it spent
£1,775,900 in construction and equip-
ment, and “the one distillery which
reached the production stage” made away
with another £123,800, “operating losses.
“Nationalisation for ever, and down with
the trading banks!”
There is no gratitude in this world.
Witness the treatment of Dr. Evatt, who
(1) released interned Communists and
took the ban off their party; (2) eased
war-time regulations against “anti-
Fascists”; (3) exchanged Ministers
with Moscow obediently to Communist
demands; (4) appointed an able-
bodied Com. and his ,wife to the
Moscow staff; and (5) extolled
Russian “statesmen” and policy. In spite
of all, the Communist party is circulat-
ing a speech by Vishinsky, who sneered
that the proceedings of the Australian
delegations to U.N.O. “recall the words
of a famous Russian fabulist: ‘A tom-
tit took over beyond the seas. She
boasted that she could set fire to the
waters.’ Actually, however, the Aus-
tralian tomtit did not set fire to the sea,
and the whole business is ending, as in
Paris, in the tomtit’s discomfiture.”
T. B. McGuire, a Brisbane estate-agent,
has challenged Government or private
builders to build timber homes on the
Queensland Statistician’s December, 1947,
estimate of £9O a square, adding that
Housing Commission prices are £124 a
square in Maryborough and £ll9 12s. in
Gladstone. McGuire says a timber
house which cost £BOO before the war
would, with land, now cost £2200 and,
allowing 10 p.c. for all annual charges,
put the owner up for £220 a year. The
man might faint if he knew costs per
square in the McGirr State.

Jap cruisers, and, after she was aban-
doned, Nip destroyers firing over open
sights took two hours to sink her. Can-
berra, torpedoed and shelled by the
enemy, absorbed four torpedoes and 260
shells from U.S. destroyers before she’d
go. Perhaps the best criterion of British
workmanship was cruiser Liverpool,
torpedoed in the Mediterranean, The
explosion of torpedo and petrol stored in
her bow cracked her athwartships. The
whole of the foc’s’le, from the stem back
to and including A turret, twisted off and
dropped under the sea. Bulkheads held,
and she made harbor stern-first.

“Edgeways”: Unlike “Mac Hoots” (B.
21/4/’4B), I’ve been disenchanted by the
frailty of Dr. load. There had been
hopes that the doctor might soon edify
the whole Christian world with an ex-
ample of a returned prodigal. His long,
freethinking quest for the good life,
during which the materialism of Aus-
tralians had been sadly noted, recently
led him to acknowledge virtues in
Christianity. Now his denials to the train-
“The other bus couldn't take it, lady"
inspector have outnumbered Peter’s. In
the British Left Wing, moreover, Dr. load
has been one of the most resplendent
feathers, yet scarcely have his colleagues
heroically nationalised the railways than
the doctor “avoids a fare of 17s. Id.”

“Plop”: “This record,” the radio
announcer told me, “is a sizzling nifty
straight from the States with Perry
Como doing the spadework and the
Andrews Sisters rendering a very sweet
refrain.” They were off: “Blow, blow,
thou winter wind,” burbled the crooner.
“Yes, blow-ow, blowblowblow,” replied
the squealing sorority. Then together:
“Thou art not so unkind, blow blow,
as man’s ingratitude, blow, blow,” and
so on, ad inflammation. With them went
an array of trumpets and saxophones
that raised winter wind to a raucous
hurricane. I am fond of Shakspeare, but
I spun the radio-dial and for once en-
joyed the dulcet mellowness of Parlia-
ment in session.

“Zake”: I thought I’d seen everything.
Then the other day the corner grocer
hopped out of his shop and hurried to
the next-door cottage, the owner of which
was talking to me at the front gate.
“Give us a match, will you, Bert?” he
said. “Got a traveller in the shop—he
hasn’t one to light his cigarette and neither
have I!”

“Clooter”: During all these beerless
weeks in Sydney I have not been able to
distract my mind from the fascination
of the set-up. Here is a city which had
achieved notoriety on the score of its
obsession for beer; a place wherein
people had been, prepared to pay extrava-
gant prices for the stuff after lawful
hours ; where hundreds of dubious fellows
made small fortunes in catering for the
seemingly depraved urban appetite, and
where it was genuinely feared the stop-
ping of his beer from “the worker” would
cause unheard-of upheavals. Yet when
a few barrel-hungers went on strike ‘and
the beer consequently dried up, nobody
appeared to care a rap. But the humor
of the situation faded somewhat when a
desperate Digger sought my help in get-
ting a few bottles for his Anzac reunion.
Knowing the value of an efficient lubri-
cant for the flow of good-fellowship on
such occasions, I did my best, but ’twas
vain. Nowhere in all the vast city, it
appeared, was there a bottle for sale. I
put the distressed Digger off the premises
and picked up a book to spice my lunch.
The page opened of itself, and words
seemed to leap to mine eyes;
And the traveller calls for his glass of
ale, having been without one for more
than 10 minutes and the host’s daugh-
ter comes streaming forth in a flowered
gown and ear-rings, carrying with four of
her beautiful fingerS the foaming glass
The sandwich became ashes in my mouth,
and as I rushed madly towards the water-
tap I’ll swear I heard an astral chuckle
as Leigh Hunt’s shade vanished,
* * * * .
“Macann”: A point about the drunk-
lessness and crimelessness attaching to
Sydney’s beer strike which seems to have
been noted by nobody— not even by the
people who for years have groaned under
a line of whispering propaganda they
could now triumphantly refute—is that
wine and other gargles have been avail-
able throughout. The Australian wine
people have been the special targets ; in
fact, I can’t recall a crime of violence
with booze mixed up in it where the
booze wasn’t reported as wine and the
wine further stigmatised as plonk, steam
or bombo. Brandy, freely obtainable
while Sydney has been so free of crime,
has long been dubbed “lunatic soup,”
and has had the further evil name tagged
on to it of being “bad for the heart” ;
this last, I gather, originally the stroke of
genius of Queen Victoria, who, visiting
Scotland, asked if there was any special
favor that might be returned for the
Scots’ hospitality and was told that the
best thing that could be done would be
to help popularise Sc6tch whisky. Cer-
tainly Australian wine people shouldn’t
have to be the scapegoats any more for
the beer-swillers.
* * * *
“Flip”: Hollywood’s publicity bubbler
gurgles on, and I see that “a genius of a
host there” has served electrically-illu-
minated fruit-salads to his guests. I like
to look at what I’m eating, too, but the
description of the host as a genius is
typical of the extravagant guff thrust upon
us by Hollywood. Still, there’s another
side to the picture. I recently read an
official winge by one of the studios
telling what they are legally up against
“Concentrate on the horse with that whip!"
in making a picture, I felt rather satis-
fied, and chuckled as I read:
We cannot show a scene of a child re-
fusing a glass of milk for fear of action by
the dairyfarmers It costs us hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually to slay such
stymies as keepipg Americans from recog-
nising their own licence-plates on an auto
loaded with fleeing film dope-peddlers. We
have to make our own plates with carefully
“snafued” numbers We have a staff
printing labels and making containers for
commercial products shown in films. We
knock ourselves out to achieve these de-
liberate inaccuracies.

“Conda”; Peace-time navy can be
entertaining. Now that quarter-deck
guns have no fouling worries, a boxing-
ring can be rigged and the service’s most
popular sport indulged in. Rules of
naval boxing differ from civilian. Each
fighter wears a red or green sash, and is
so designated. Rounds three minutes,
with no yelling allowed —only a restrained
clapping at the end of each bout. The
physical - training instructor referees,
chaplain keeps time with a 4in. cartridge
for gong, and the ship’s surgeon is in
attendance. The audience is everywhere.
Best contest I remember was when “Tug”
Wilson won the Med. Fleet heavyweight
championship for cruiser Australia the
same year the old ship, sole rep. of her
country, won the Fleet regatta.

“L. de Rideau”: The patriotic pests
who, since the success of the Australian
opera season at Melbourne Princess, have
suddenly discovered an intense interest in
music and are demanding the application
of the White Australia policy to the
J.C.W. Italian opera company received
an amusing setback. One excited
correspondent of a daily said that
the success of the season showed that
Australia had no need of importations.
Asked to name the operas which had
contributed to the season’s triumph, he
mentioned “Aida,” “Rigoletto,” “Faust,”
“Figaro” and “Carmen” —two Italians,
two Frenchmen and one German.

“Spokeshave”: Our iceman, a very
charming fellow, complains that too many
housewives invite him to have a cup of
tea. If he accepted all this hospitality
he would still be on his round at mid-
night, so he searched for a formula that
would meet the menace. “No, thanks,”
he says. “I’ve just had a quince.” This
seems to satisfy them.

“Medicus”: There is little in history
to prove whether neuroses have or have
not greatly increased in the last 50 years
(B. 7/4/’4B). The mental aberra-
tions of a favored few may be recorded,
but the nervous afflictions of the masses
are mostly ignored. Still, a reasonable
interpretation of recent happenings sug-
gests an increase. Surely there would be
some record if, as now, a third at least
of any nation’s people had been afflicted
with neuroses. “Pawang” ignores the
publicity element. Ancient Egypt, Rome
and medieval Europe all had well-
organised publicity agencies, but they
were trivial compared with modern news-
papers, radio and talkies. In the last
25 years a vast amount of sentimental
and instructive publicity has been given
to neuroses, psychoses and what have
you. Human nature exploits its oppor-
tunities, especially when encouraged to
do so. Neuroses lend themselves to
cultivation and the wiles of the
malingerer. Our rude forebears knew
them not, nor encouraged them. We do.
The result is a vast increase in all func-
tional nervous disabilities.

“Becks”: Don’t know who named Rara
Avis Terraces (B. 21/4/’4B), but among
the drab “Park Views” and “Emoh Ruos”
infesting the Sydney suburb that claims
me as one of its less distinguished resi-
dents are at least two house-names that
stir my imagination every time I pass
them. I Hope the lives of the family who
live in “Merry-Times” have .fulfilled the
hopes implied in the happy name of their
cottage, but what is the story behind the
name of another villa not a great distance
away from it —“First Principles’*?

“Outback”: “Metax’s” gravedigger
(B. 14/4/’4B) has nothing on our under-
taker, from whom Mrs. X, whose hus-
band lay sick with a fever, received a sur-
prise visit. With commendable directness
he explained the reasons for his call: (1)
Seeing the doctor’s car in front of th'e
house twice that day, he concluded that
Mr. X had taken a turn for the worse.
(2) A rival in a nearby town was cutting
in a bit, and business was business. (3)
He wanted to go to the races next day,
and though he wish Mr. X any
harm, if there was anything doing, he’d
like the job. (4) And if Mrs. X didn’t
mind, he’d ran the rule over Mr. X now.

“Uramao”; Stage props (B. 24/3 / ’48)?
The tragedian-owner of a company play-
ing in Dublin half a century ago used
“Hamfat’s” idea of a club with 9. rubber
bulb, but instead of cochineal he used
red paint. One day he had hard words
over wages with a stagehand whose
job it was to prepare the weapon. That
night the tragedian, when waylaid
by the murderer and dealt a thump-
ing blow on the head, yelled: “Murder,
help me. By this blood I curse you, you
foul murderer.” He wiped his forehead
and held out to the audience a hand be-
smeared with green paint.

“Tetapi”: A Middle-East woman from
Alexandria has come to live in my dis-
trict and has no English. She won’t go
out of doors because she is firmly con-
vinced that the bush is full of lions and
tigers. By signs and gestures and bits
of school-French a kindly neighbor tried
to assure her that there was nothing to
be afraid of—not even a goanna. A few
days later an escaped lunatic shot another
neighbor in the sternsheets with a shot-
gun.

“Dong”: Speaking recently on educa-
tion, J. W. Metcalfe, of Sydney’s Public
Library, outlined an interesting scheme
he observed while a delegate at the
second U.N.E.S.C.O. conference in
Mexico City. The locals appeared very
keen to have everyone speaking good
Spanish. Their method is for every edu-
cated man to pick someone who cannot
roll his “amingos” and teach him how,
and at the end of the course they both
go along to the public examination. If
the pupil passes his teacher gets the cer-
tificate —a very handy document entitling
him to a sizable tax-reduction.

“5 G.R.”: Pigeon-post? When the
August 8 offensive was launched
on the Somme in 1918 General
Staff Fourth Army issued pigeons to
some of the leading troops, to be released
bearing a message containing map refer-
ence of position reached at given times.
Members of “G” staff hung around the
pigeon-lofts scanning the sky until at last
a speck developed into a pigeon that
turned and lost height, finally alighting.
Hastily unfolding the thin paper, they
read this message: “I’m sick of carrying
this bleedin’ bird.”
BEAR-CAGES.
“Mr. Winston Churchill said that Italy had saved
herself from the fate of the unhappy countries who
‘had to live in a cage with a bear.’ ”
A bear is all right, you will doubtless agree,
Wherever his proper environment be;
He can live as he likes, at his will he can roam
In the woods that provide him his natural
home.
But however broadminded you are in your views
He isn’t a room-mate you’d willingly choose,
And many must find it a trying affair,
The burden of life in a cage with a bear.
They may ask you to think that they like it,
the Poles,
The Czechs and the other unfortunate souls;
They may gammon there’s nothing therein that
disturbs
The feelings of Magyars, Bulgars or Serbs.
But puppets who’re gripped in the Muscovites’
hold
Must do as they’re bidden and say what they’re
told.
And who in the blithering blazes would share,
Save under compulsion, a cage with a bear?
A bear is no creature for hate or for fear
Perhaps when he isn’t unpleasantly near,
And to keep him well distant is clearly the
choice
When the matter is left to the popular voice.
Hence the lesson, I take it, from Italy’s votes,
The salient fact her decision denotes,
Is here is a country that’s fully aware
Of the peril of sharing a cage with a bear.
A phrase with the pithy Winstonian touch,
In compass so slender conveying so much,
A prospect to shy at, a picture to scare!
Who’d like to be cooped in a cage with a bear?

“p.H.E.”; The lesson was speech-
training in a Sydney lower primary-
school class. The teacher had just
enunciated with the precision and vowel-
values of a 8.8. C. announcer: “The
Boy Scout found a pound on the ground”
and prepared to correct any Australian-
isms in the repetition of the words. But
before the class could come back in
chorus one small boy piped up: “Please,
Miss, I know a boy who talks like that
when he’s not in school.”

“X.N.0.”: “Piping the side” is hardly
the Navy’s highest compliment. I should
have thought “dressing ship” and the
“21-gun salute” were higher. Never
heard pf them being paid to other than
Royalty. But there was one occasion
when the old Australia piped for a very
junior lieutenant, non-executive rank at
that. Australia’s very first Surgeon-
Lieut. (D.) joined his ship at Hervey Bay
in a bright new uniform on a bright new
day. The Quartermaster was not so
bright. Spotting a sleeve handsomely
bedecked in gold lace, he promptly piped
the side as for a flag-officer. Then, some-
what amazed at his ceremonious recep-
tion, a blushing dentist stepped on deck
and the “Quarter” realised he had mis-
taken two half-inch rings and the orange
velvet between them for a Commodore’s
broad stripe.

“Plop”: On the morning after a moist
and happy Anzac Day one of the
originals was phoned to see if he’d sur-
vived. He had, was still in excellent
fettle, and chuckled his reply: “Boy, what
a party.’ I woke up with my bed on
fire.”

“Uramao”: Dunedin (M.L.) has been
celebrating the centennial of the arrival
of two shiploads of Scots who set out, as
Mark Twain said, for the Kingdom of
Heaven, arrived at Otago Heads, and,
thinking they had reached their destina-
tion, disembarked only to discover that the
old whalers and sealers were not the type
they expected to find in a Scots’ better
land. Among pleasing messages of con-
gratulations received by the town was
one from another Dunedin —in Florida,
U.S.A. Established by Scots and still run
by Scots, the American edition of old
Edinburgh is a rich fruit-growing centre
and possesses the finest citrus-cleaning
and -packing machinery in the States. It
was founded by John Ogilvie Douglas,
who has relations in M.L.’s Dunedin. A
holiday resort in wintertime for pluto-
crats from New York, Chicago and other
big cities, the American Dunedin’s popu-
lation, ordinarily about 1600, is then
trebled by tourists seeking the warmer
climate.

“Uco”; Nicknames for trains (B.
21/4/’48)? Twenty-odd years ago South
Australia imported from America a Rail-
ways Commissioner, name of Webb, who
gave the State its first modem engines for
40 years, pepped-up the efficiency of the
service and built Adelaide a decent rail-
way-station. Among his innovations was
a type of rail-motor. Like the Horsham one
it was painted with safety stripes which
brought it at first the name of the Tiger,
but that soon lapsed. The stripes were
hardly necessary; the siren with which
the motor heralded its approach could
be heard miles away and its note was
nothing like that of a tiger. No roar, it
was a full-throated bellow. In recognition
of the Premier who brought Webb to
Adelaide the rail-car was universally
known as Barwell’s Bull.

“ ’Any Garto”: Japan’s famed
blossom burst into bloom along the
beautiful Kintia Valley to mark the first
week of April as one for festivities by the
inhabitants. Along the grassed river-
banks, or even the gravel-spits in the
river, thousands of families spread rush
mats beneath the cherry-trees, then settled
down to a party of rice-cakes and sake.
“If you don't turn out to be a prince I'll squash you."
At the end of the day drunks sprawled
everywhere, “momma-sans” included,
, most of them too full to move. In the
temple area the drunken larrikins lashed
into each other with boots, heavily-
buckled belts ; quart-bottles were wielded
viciously. One half-naked, blood-spat-
tered creature, after flattening a smaller
opponent with a skull-splitting smash, ran
berserk. A few Japanese police,
hamstrung with non-violent methods
directed by Occupational sources,
or not caring anyway, stood by.
Despite the. drunken state of the
revellers, Occupation troops wander-
ing about were never molested. After
seeing three cherry-blossom seasons I
think the build-up is far greater than the
show, for within a few days the slightest
breeze brings the petals down like snow-
flakes ; within a week the blooms have
completely disappeared. For the Japs it
is a good excuse for a picnic, though
mainly a drunken orgy.

“Brebis”; As each successive beer slid
down his gullet the loud-voiced bar
orator grew more vehement in his de-
nunciation of the capitalist system of
Australia. Under Socialism things would
be different. Look at the price of food.
“Take apples,” he bellowed. “How can
I afford threepence each for apples for
my kids?” In his excitement his elbow
jogged his schooner and over went the
beer. “Be careful,” admonished a quiet-
voiced bloke beside him., “You’ve just
spilt three of your kids’ apples on the
floor.” -

“Suvic”: Potent potions? Keen to be
the perfect guest in a Winnipeg home, I
hid my surprise at the tiny nip, and the
suggestion of water with what looked
and smelt like sherry. With a cheery
“Good health” I swallowed it neat. Five
minutes later I was able to ask what hit
me, I learned, that the Canucks have a
gentle custom of freezing a barrel of
cider, then tapping the unfrozen alcohol,
which they color with burnt sugar.
Giving me just enough time to absorb this
information, the room began to spin, not
stopping until about six hours later.
* * * *
“Cauboy”: For the first time in Mel-
bourne theatrical history a box-office
queue was started the day before the show
opened—in this case, of course, the
Olivier company at the Princess. The
history-makers were two 18-year-old girl
students of the Conservatorium drama
school who started their cold vigil in
Glen’s doorway in Collins-street 27 hours
before the box-plan opened for “The
School for Scandal.” They started some-
thing—-a form of theatrical hysteria, un-
known since the days of Marcus Superbus
Knight. At Six every morning 100 de-
voted individuals assemble in front of
Glen’s and jyait patiently till nine the
next morning.
♦ * * ♦
“Jim O’Keeffe”: It’s time the word
“kick,” an insidious expansionist and
usurper of the functions of other words,
was kicked back into its proper place in
the language. As an indicator of wallops
with boot or hoof it is useful and correct,
but it chokes many other useful words
when modern laziness, or striving after
the picturesque, lets it loose. You get a
kick from an electrical contact, not a
shock. Cranking the car is dangerous
at times; it may backfire and kick
you. When the motor does get
going it kicks over. Kids don’t mis-
behave nowadays; they kick over the
traces. No tradesman has an assistant,
but a side-kick is usually about the place.
The noisy, unreliable affair that some-
times pushes my flattie about was sold to
me as an outboard-motor, I have lately
discovered that it is a stern-kicker. I
don’t kick around as much as I did. I
have to dig in my kick and kick in with
two-and-a-kick for every gallon of petrol.
That kicks the pocket, so I don’t get
much kick out of motoring. Anyway,
the motor is feeling its age and hasn’t the
kick it once had. The wife kicks up
when I stay out late, especially if I drink
anything with a kick in it. I’d like to
kick her relations out, but my brother
stayed a week in 1930, so she reckons
I’ve got no kick coming.
* * * ♦
“Ceg’’: Everybody is now used to the
tantalising window-displays of bottles of
beer and whisky, cartons and packets of
cigarettes, luscious boxes of chocolates
and so on, which, on closer examination,
turn out to be what is known in the
trade as “blanks.” It was left to a
Perth baker, however, to dispose of a
jarrah dummy of dark fruit-cake to a
customer. The “cake” was in the window
and a woman was served with it by a
girl who did not realise it was only a
dummy. It was wrapped in greaseproof
paper, and when the woman’s husband
tried to cut it he found it was wood.
“Not like mother used to make,” he ex-
claimed. He phoned the baker and
complained, but rang olf before the baker
could explain. Flourbags is now trying
to find the man so that he can make
amends. A real cake or his money back,

“B. M. Lever”; Four years ago this
month the British Eastern Fleet was
waiting for our bombers, and theirs, to
return from a surprise raid on Sabang.
We’d been exercising for months for this,
and no sooner would we of the destroyer-
screen radar ping on a Nip plane than
Corsairs from the fleet carriers would
jump him into the sea. Standing by our
waiting gun. Number Three spat his dis-
gust. “What’s up with those mugs?” he
growled. “Don’t they think we want to
play, too?” And, pointing to an inno-
cent seagull flapping over the foc’sle,
“It’s a wonder they let that ruddy bird
come in!”

“Murrum”: More about the “shov,
wood” (B. 21/4/’4B). In falling for the
Q.M.’s story “Hep 2-3-4” erred in good
company. About 10 years ago London
“Punch” printed the same yam, though
in a naval setting. In acknowledging
the howl of protests at having been taken
in with a chestnut, it printed, as well as
some of the genuine protests, some
fictitious letters, including one as from
Hitler, which was a gorgeous piece of
fooling. “Punch,” if I remember rightly,
spelt the item as one word —shovewood.
* * * ♦
“Curtain Raiser”: There has been
some v scepticism over Eileen Joyce’s
statement that changing her dress during
the intervals between composers not only
keeps her fingers supple but gives her
inspiration. That has been taken as a
rationalisation of what would certainly
be a box-office attraction with some
patrons, who would get far more of a
thrill out of speculating what color she
would wear for Brahms and what for
Debussy than they would out of the
music ; but with an artist of the quality
of Miss Joyce I doubt if that would be
her reason. Wagner is said to have got
inspiration from stroking velvet cushions
while composing. Still, it would be no
good a potential young composer buying
a set of velvet cushions and hoping to
produce a “Gotterdammerung,” and it is
to be hoped Miss Joyce hasn’t started a
sartorial fashion for would-be virtuosos
to follow.
* * * *
“Tidak Makan”; Searching for some
overdue hikers between Moruya and
Braidwood (N.S.W.) a Tiger Moth pilot
saw an isolated humpy. He circled low
and saw someone come out of the humpy
and wave. A note was dropped asking
the cove on the ground to go back in-
side if he had not seen the hikers; if
he had, to walk a quarter of a mile in
the direction they had taken. The note
was picked up and apparently read ; then
the cove on the ground be'gan to wave
vigorously. with his hat. The pilot hung
around for about 20 minutes and dropped
another note repeating instructions.
Same result. The pilot called it a day.
Later a policeman at Moruya enlightened
him. The bloke in the humpy was an
old abo. unable to read or write.
RADIO ANNOUNCERS.
“H. L. Mencken, in his book The American
Language, gives a brief account of the struggles of
radio announcers between academic imitations of
Oxford English and general American pronunciation.”
Here too, I think, you’ll sometimes catch them
erring,
The chaps who put us wise to what they know
Of various events, supremely stirring
Or mildly dull, via the radio;
Give us a summary of what’s occurring
From Pietermaritzburg to Tokyo.
Some chances they must take, you can’t ignore,
Pronouncing words they never heard before.
At times, apart from when they’re concen-
trating
On' proper nouns, I seem to hear a snort
Of acid disapproval emanating
From somebody of the pedantic sort,
Evoked by the announcer prolongating
A syllable that should by rights be short.
But, come to think of it, how few there be
Who sound all parts of speech impeccably.
Little I find to fault in their equipping,
Little to. carp ht in their vocal gaits,
While they refrain their final g’s from clipping
Or playing fast and loose with aspirates,
Or into any other gaucheries slipping
Such as our Parliamentary debates
From Canberra, as doubtless you’re aware,
Supply in ample measure on the air.
Of bloomers like enough they make their quota,
As fallible as all poor mortals are.
Still in their broadcasts you may sometimes
note a
Correction of some error popular:
For instance, what I used to call Bogota
I’ve lately ascertained is Bogot-a,
Something I might have never come to know
Without announcements on the radio.

“Ek Dum”: If aerial war
were to break out Australia
would be better prepared in the
air than at the opening of World
War 11, but, having regard to the
relative preparedness of other
countries, still lagging like a lame
duck.
Even now 80 per cent, of Aus-
tralian air-mechanics have never
seen a jet engine except, perhaps,
to take a hurried peep at one.
Ninety per cent, of our fighter
reserve would not know what to
do if put into a fast jet fighter.
The bulk of them have not flown
near the rim limits of the speed
range which will become
standard practice within a year
or two in every modern country.
All Out of Date
All aircraft of 1945 are virtu-
ally out of date. In the United
States production has ceased on
World War II types of B-29,
P-47 Thunderbolts, North
American P-51 Mustangs, P-61
Black Widows, C-475, C-45 Sky-
masters, the Grumman, Hell-
cat, Tigercat, Corsair, Helldiver,
Avenger, Catalina, PBM
Mariner, R-50. Lodestar. These
and many others, while still in
use, are no longer being made.
Newer versions of some of
these types among the transport
and bombing classes have been
put into production—such as the
huge PBM-5A Mariner.
New types include the B-36,
which is about twice the size of
the B-29 Superfortress and can
carry a load of 10 tons of
bombs 10,000 miles.
Another is the P2V-2 patrol
bomber (Neptune), one of the
earlier editions of which flew
recently from Perth (W.A.) to
Columbus (Ohio), 11,236 miles
non-stop.
It carries, inter alia, six fixed
20mm. cannon in the nose instead
of the two ,50cal. flexibles in the
first version of the machine ; two
more in the dorsal turret, two in
the tail, plus 16 sin. rockets and
two torpedoes or a dozen depth-
charges. It has search-radar plus
a series of tactical radar gadgets,
thermal de-icing for wing and
enpennage, and the new Hamil-
ton three-blade props with
alcohol de-icing equipment com-
plete. The U.S. Navy has three
squadrons operating and keeps
on adding to the order.
Other machines for which
substantial orders have been
placed by the U.S. Air Force in-
clude the N.A. P-86, which has
a speed of over 600 m.p.h., a ceil-
ing of over 40,000 ft. and a range
of 1000 miles.
The Boeing B-50 —top speed
of 400 m.p.h.—is being requisi-
tioned in quantity; so is the big
four-jet bomber N.A. B-45, a
Douglas production designed for
a low-altitude attack-plane. Top
speed is more than 480 m.p.h.
The P-82, also on order, is
powered with 2200-h.p. Allisons
and has top speed over 475
m.p.h. and range 2500 miles,
carries six .50 calibre guns
mounted in the wing-centre plus
a “pack of eight” under thie
wing, apart from an assortment
of bombs, rockets, chemical
tanks and other paraphernalia
which make her look like a per-
ambulating grocery store until
she begins to hit.
Early in January it was re-
ported that 600 Thunderjets were
on order by the U.S. Govern-
ment. These are to be used to
completely refit the 14th and
20th Fighter Groups.
Some of the U.S. Navy’s new
samples include the F4U-5
Corsair with a top speed at or
near 500 m.p.h., FBF-1 Grum-
man Bearcat in the same speed-
range, F9F-2 Grumman Panther,
which will go into main produc-
tion supply in 1949—a fighter
fitted as interchangeable for
Pratt and Whitney* Nene and
Allison Turbojets. Its fop speed
is round 650 m.p.h., and yet it
has a landing speed of only 85
m.p.h. Preliminary orders are
in for McDonnell jet fighters
FH-1, with F2H-1 Banshees
coming into production this
summer in the U.S. Substantial
orders also have been placed for
Douglas AD-1 Skyraiders fitted
with a 2500-h.p. Wright R-3350
engine and with fuselage dive-
brakes for use in long dives.
And these are only intermedi-
ates. The only reason that im-
proved standard types are being
put into use so slowly has been
that it takes a long time to train
air personnel to new types of
flying and new speeds.
Wonders to Come
Glimpses of the future and
what it holds are given by the
performances of two or three
machines in the prototype stage,
but due for almost immediate
production on some scale.
One of them is the U.S. swept-
wing XB-47 bomber. This neat
little craft weighs 125,0001 b. It
is believed to have a top speed
in level flight of over 600 m.p.h.
and its manufacturers reported
an indicated diving speed of
720 m.p.h.!
In Britain the Flying Wing,
AW-52, a curtain-raiser for a
200,0001 b. machine of the same
type now on the drawing-boards,
weighs 33,0001 b., is fitted with
two Rolls-Royce Nenes, has a
normal range of 1500 miles at
36,000 ft., but can increase this
to 2150 miles with overload
tanks. The pilot has a pres-
surised cabin and an ejectment
seat which can be operated even
at the maximum speed round
500 m.p.h.
The Ghost Vampire, which
made 56,000 ft. recently a
standard machine save for de-
letion of armament and the in-
clusion of a special metal cock-
pit—made its climb in 25
minutes, with a vertical ascent
rate of 75 m.p.h.—lloft./sec.
for the first 30,000 ft.
In any war which may come
from now onwards Field-
Marshal Montgomery’s dictum
that it is necessary to fight your
air battle before you fight the
ground engagement will be taken
as axiomatic. And strategic
bombing as practised by the new
giants will make the thousand-
craft bombing of Cologne look
like a game of *toy jsoldiers.
Bombing is not yet a completely
decisive weapon against an ad-
versary of equal strength. But
it is a vital one against which a
combatant must have instant and
effective defence if he is to sur-
vive.
Paddington Protests.
“Ek Dum”: Eastern Com-
mand in Sydney put on a splen-
did military tattoo on the two
nights preceding Anzac Day.
The spectacle was one to thrill
the eye and the ear and to bring
home to the onlooker the im-
plications of military training
and at the same time the horror
of war. The physique of the
participants could not have been
bettered anywhere in the world,
and the discipline and drill in
the set pieces were at Guards
standard,
« Nevertheless there were loud
complaints from the neighbor-
hood —Paddington and similar
suburbs —about the supposed
horrors of the show. The
description published in the
“S. M. Herald” made the reader
wonder what would happen if a
couple of bombs ever fell in
Paddington.
At the sound of a few salvoes
of aircraft fire and mock
bombs Paddingtonians, accord-
ing to the report, became sleep-
less for the night. Dogs rushed
up and down howling and hid
under beds. Workers who had to
get up early in the morning
could not rest.
All this from Paddington,
which suffers, without protest,
the spluttering roar of “minia-
ture cars” on the “Sports-
ground” for nights on end with-
out complaint and which puts
up with the tremendous local
dislocation caused by the Royal
Show for a fortnight without a
murmur. It suggests that some
complaints may have the same
origin as the protests raised in
1940 against the sending of
men to reinforce the A.I.F.
in the Middle East because
they were to be used to
fight Soviet Russia —in point of
fact they were at that moment
fighting Soviet Russia, which was
Hitler’s ally and supplying him
with materials with which to kill
Australians, as the documents
recently released by the United
States .Government show.
It is to be hoped that the
military tattoo will be continued
next year and that it will be ex-
tended to other capitals. But if
it is to serve its full use it must
be popularised as the military
forces must be popularised.
There should be some citizens’
body to support the patriotic
officers who are giving their time
to the organisation of citizen
divisions at pay which will not
cover their out-of-pocket ex-
penses in most cases, and to
make the rank-and-file realise
that their patriotism is appreci-
ated and that the community is
behind them.
The State Governments, which
are just as much interested,
though they take no responsi-
bility, might well bestir them-
selves along with municipalities
to help provide facilities to
assure the necessities of train-
ing—proper sporting equipment,
libraries, social centres and space
in which to do the work of
training properly.
There would be less growling
from Paddington if Paddington
(and the rest of the country)
were made to appreciate that
Australian defence is its per-
sonal defence and military

In all its history, Australia has never

Government as the Chifley-Ward-Evalt

IN THE 1944 REFERENDUM, when they thought
the going was good, they tried a wholesale grab of new
powers over the lives and liberties of the people.
TWO YEARS LATER they tried again, particularly
for power over industry and employment—in other
words, INDUSTRIAL CONSCRIPTION.
Both times they told you dire things
would happen if you turned them
down. Well, you DID turn them down
—but have any of these threatened
calamities happened?

Australia’s Defence
On the day of the tattoo Mr.
Chambers announced that enlist-
ment for the Permanent Army,
which had began in the first
week in August last year, had
reached 5000 out of the 19,000
sought. He said this was “an
excellent figure in the short time
recruiting had been in progress”
—a staggering statement which
"What feeling! What atmosphere! Why, you can
almost smell them!’"
should be enough to have him
removed from the Ministry.
Mr. Dedman gave the total
strength of the defence forces at
43,694, which includes 11,107 in
the R.A.A.F., of whom 6859
were in the permanent force and
the balance in the interim force.
The Army strength is 5411
permanents and 17,788 in the in-
terim force. Except for the
8.0.A.C. in Japan, which the
Ministry is thinking of abolish-
ing—some people allege because
of recruiting difficulties —Aus-
tralia’s 7£ million people have
so far shown themselves®able to
produce only enough men for
administrative duties; It remains
to be seen whether the position
will be better with citizen-force
recruiting.
The R.A.A.F. boasts 9388
men, of whom only 1652 are
permanent and 7736 interim, in-
cluding 4317 accepted for the
permanent force but not yet
tested.
If an enemy were to land in
Australia tomorrow he would
find here enough permanent
soldiers of all ages' and sizes to
produce a brigade of some sort
for the defence of the whole
continent, the material of
another brigade, on a very thin
scale, being dedicated to the
occupation of Japan. He would
find enough R.A.A.F. to defend,
perhaps, Alice Springs (if it had
aircraft capable of standing up
to modern attack). He would
find a navy obsolete, or obso-
lescent in all but very minor
units.
And he would find the
material of the push-button war
—the long-range weapons pro-
ject—in a state of advancement
which Mr. Chifley hopes will in
three years, if the unions let it,
produce something which may
be able to blow out an invading
force—if it can hit it.
Apart from the cloud of poli-
tics that surrounds military mat-
ters, it is difficult to understand
the attitude of young men to en-
listment. The services provide a
splendid life for men of an ad-
venturous or technical turn of
mind. Enlistment in one of the
technical services such as the
A.E.M.E. provides a much bet-
ter training for a start in life
than the kind of course now
available at some of Australia’s
overcrowded universities.
The Blain Case.
“Ek Dum”: For a long time
no issue has come before Par-
liament of which the Govern-
ment is' more frightened than
the Blain case.
Its attitude throughout has
been one of resistance to in-
quiry. After the vile charge had
been made by its Mr. Mulcahy
it was prepared to leave the un-
fortunate Digger member for
the Northern Territory under
the imputation that he had
shown his gold pass to the
Japanese to obtain favorable
treatment —this although its
Army Minister must have known
that the charge was' a cruel un-
truth.
The storm which burst round
Ministerial heads may have
astonished them. They were
forced into appointing a com-
mittee of privilege headed by
the übiquitous Dr. Evatt, not by
any means a personal friend of
Mr. Plain, and including a Gov-
ernment majority.
Not a line of evidence was
adduced to support the charge,
leaving the assumption that it
was a fabrication by somebody.
The affidavits produced by Mr.
Plain proved beyond doubt that
he had never sought favor from
the Japanese while their captive,
but that he had actually given
them cause to feel an especial
enmity towards him, to torture
him and to imprison him.
The committee cleared him,
but, contrary to the normal prac-
tice of Parliament in such cases,
the evidence given is surrounded
by an aura of secrecy. It is
locked away in a safe in Parl-
iament House. Members who
are allowed to see it are bound
to secrecy by fearsome pains and
penalties.
Rumors fly round Parliament
of further dire charges of the
dreadful things which will hap-
pen to any member who dares
to fight the matter out. The
faithful Sunday press was called
to for aid on the eve of battle:
There was general uneasiness in
the House after Opposition-leader
Menzies had given notice that he
would move next week to censure
Labor member Daniel Mulcahy for
unproved allegations against Mac-
Alister Blain, Independent member for
the Northern Territory.
Some members in all parties fear
that, if the debate goes on, it may
become so bitter that eventually all
sides will regret it.
On the day before the debate
on the motion by the Leader of
the Opposition was to have
taken place the Prime Minister
moved that Government business
take precedence on that day—
when Mr. Lang also was to have
moved for a ban on the Com-
munists. There was no
urgency about any of the Gov-
ernment measures due for. de-
bate. Those actually under con-
sideration were the bills to
provide an enlarged Parlia-
ment. These certainly could
have waited till September,
since the election is not due
till next year. The only
urgency about them is that,
being designed to produce a per-
manent Labor majority in Par-
liament, they would certainly
affect the courage of the wilting
members of Mr. Chifley’s party
like a hormone injection when
they tackle the Prices Referen-
dum campaign, which some of
them are approaching in the
spirit of the Portuguese Army of
World War I. They weren’t so
urgent that an hour or so could
riot be spared to allow Mr. Hay-
len to plead for preference to
New Guinea natives over white
colonists.
However, Mr. Chifley moved
to gag out the Plain and anti-
Com. motions and would only
give the vaguest of promises that
the Plain Report might be con-
sidered next June—which was
pretty safe, since it is known
that he is trying to avoid meet-
ing the House till August or
September.
Mr. Menzies made a short
speech of protest, and Mr. Lang
a longer one. When Mr. Mc-
Ewen, who had originally raised
the question which led to the
appointment of the Committee
of Privilege, rose to continue the
debate he was gagged.
He was at the time Acting-
Leader of the Country party,
and until now the Speaker has
not felt it proper to gag leaders
of parties on such a resolution,
but Mr. McEwen was duly
gagged against all precedent. To
add novelty to this proceeding
the usual gag - master, Mr.
Scully, whose sole duty as Vice-
President of the Executive Coun-
cil appears to be to move that
“the question be now put,” was
not used as executioner. For
political reasons apparently the
axe was handed to Mr. Pollard,
one of the few returned soldiers
in the Federal Labor party, who
performed the task with much
less than his usual exuberance.
More will be heard of the
matter. As the case rests the
member for the Northern Terri-
tory has been acquitted by a
committee in secret. His acquit-
tal has not been confirmed by the
House. And the report of the
committee was placed softly on
the Table of the House in the
dead of night when most of the
press had gone home and the
broadcasting apparatus had been
turned off. • The evidence has
been stifled.
The Government has every
reason to be scared.

WINES—
PEROSNAL ITEMS
Off the screen and the stage and in
civvies in Melbourne Laurence Olivier
isn’t the glamor-boy some people saw in
him when he played “Henry V” in techni-
color and in terms of Elizabethan con-
ventions. He is a serious-minded person
who doesn’t like small-talk and whose
prime interest is acting. He also confesses
to liking those roles best in which he is
least like himself, such as Dr. Astrov in
Chekhov’s “Uncle Vanya,” for the reason
that he isn’t a bit like Astrov —not a bit
flamboyant, “although flamboyancy and
bravura, unfortunately, always come easy
to me,” Like so many actors, he emerged
into the limelight from a clerical back-
ground. His father was a High Church
parson at Dorking, Surrey, and his
French name comes from his Huguenot
ancestry. It was while he was learning
liturgical music at the Oxford Choir
school that he first felt the lure of the
footlights, and he first donned the bus-
kins in a female part—Katherine in “The
Taming of the Shrew,” done in the Eliza-
bethan fashion at Stratford-on-Avon. It
was his liking for flamboyant parts which
was responsible for the biggest miss in his
theatrical career when, after playing
Stanhope in “Journey’s End” at the
Apollo in December, 1928, he passed the
part over when the play opened at the
Savoy the following month, preferring
that of Michael in “Beau Geste.” The
P. C. Wren opus lasted a matter of weeks ;
“Journey’s End” clocked 594 perform-
ances. What Olivier regards as his great-
est effort, his production of a film “Ham-
let,” will probably land in Australia
during his stay.
Australians visiting America are often
amazed at the ignorance of enlightened
Americans concerning this part of the
world. M. P. Adams, at present looking
over his old haunts in Sydney and Mel-
bourne, has spent most of the last 20
years attempting to dispel some of this
ignorance. In that time he has lectured
on Australia in almost every State of the
Union and to all types of audiences from
junior high - school youngsters to
National Geographic Society members.
When war came to the Pacific the U.S,
Army engaged him to give G.ls. the low-
down on what to expect in Australia. Be-
fore he went to the States, Adams was a
Melbourne journalist; he covered sport
and the theatre for “Punch” and “Table
Talk”—both now deceased —and was a
frequent contributor to The Bulletin’s
“Poverty Point” and “Sporting Notions.”
On this visit he is on the lookout for
new lecture material, in particular some
good travelogues and Nature films.
In accepting the post of Administrator
of the Marshall Plan, Paul Hoffman has
taken on what has been described in his
own country as, apart from the Presi-
dency, the most important job in Ameri-
can peace-time history. With Presidential
elections looming up, the appointment
called for a man who would be accept-
able to both parties, of who
wins at the polls next November. Hoff-
man seems to be the answer. He’s a
Republican who is known as a “liberal
businessman,” and, as chairman of the
Committee for Economic Development,
he has urged lowered tariffs and
liberalised unemployment compensation.
Studebaker Corporation, of which he has
been president since 1935, has under his
control beep relatively free from labor
troubles. Last year President Truman ap-
pointed him to the Harriman Committee
on Foreign Aid, which had the task of
planning the preliminaries of the Euro-
pean Recovery Programme; more re-
cently his evidence before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee helped to
convince wavering Senators of the neces-
sity of American aid to Europe. Hoff-
man’s attitude on the Marshall Plan is
that it is a scheme for helping Europe
to help itself.
Among the 16 medals to be awarded
to war correspondents by President
Truman will be one to Osmar White. He
was war correspondent for Melbourne
“Herald” in the Pacific and European
theatres from 1941 to 1945, and was on
the spot when Germany signed her un-
conditional surrender at Rheims on May
7, 1945. His Green Armour is a very
good account of the early stages of the
war in New Guinea. Born at Fielding
(M.L.), be is 39.
Ambitious bank-clerks uncertain of
their future should try their luck over-
seas if the experience of two Australians
at present holidaying in their native land
is a true guide. One of them, A. Fenton,
left this country 35 years ago in search
of a job. He found it in San Francisco,
where he joined a furnishing concern and
in due course became office manager. A
couple of jobs later he was managing-
director of the Illinois Glass Company ;
then he joined the Bank of America.
That was in 1921; he is now vice-presi-
dent of the bank. Osborne Smith’s bank-
ing career followed more direct channels.
He began in Sydney as a junior in the
Bank of New South Wales, transferred
to the Commonwealth Bank and became
Melbourne manager. Moved to London
as manager, he changed horses and be-
came a governing-director of the Imperial
Bank of India and subsequently governor
of the Reserve Bank of India. In 1929
he was created K.B. and three years later
K.C.I.E.
In horticultural circles none has made
Australia more widely known than
rosarian Alister Clark, 8.A., of Glenara,
Bulla (Vic.). The award of the Peter Barr
Memorial Cup by the Royal Horticultural
Society in London for raising new
varieties of daffodil isn’t the first he has
gained. In 1936 he won the Dean Hole
medal, the highest international award for
roses. Born at Bulla, he was educated at
Hobart, Sydney Grammar and Cam-
bridge, where he got his B.A. If a new
rose is wanted to commemorate some
occasion he can be depended upon to
produce it. A foundation member of the
Victorian Rose Society, he built up its
national prize fund of £450 by propagat-
ing and selling new varieties which now
flourish in hundreds of suburban gardens.
As a contrast, he has been chairman of
the Moonee Valley Race Club since 1917,
This is the face that has judged a
thousand Shorthorns in Scotland, U.S.A.
aqd Australia, and Dubois has captured
the keen and shrewd look on the man
when he is on the job. Walter Biggar
came from his Grange Farm, Kirkcud-
brightshire (Scot.), where he breeds Gallo-
way cattle and fat lambs that win prizes
at Scottish and English shows, to judge
fats and Shorthorns at Sydney’s Easter
Show. Though a humorist when the
occasion calls for it, Biggar is as imper-
turbable as he looks; he calmly told the
cattlemen that he was much more im-
pressed with the polls than with the
hornies he saw. Though publicly offered
some gratuitous and almost insulting
advice by a beef expert all the way from
a Sydney newspaper office, he announced
that he had met in Australia “company
more courteous than I have ever ex-
perienced,” and said that he would like
CATTLEMAN.
to see Australian beef men go for a
beast with shorter legs and consequent
greater body depth and thicker quarters.
He goes home impressed both with
Sydney Show and the rural areas that
make it possible.
Another Victorian, Dr. Alan Carey
Taylor, senior lecturer in French at the
University of Melbourne, goes to a post
in London. Born in Sydney, he did
a term at the University of Paris, and
last year was awarded a French decora-
tion for his work for Free France. His
wife, a Frenchwoman, is a University
teacher. Dr. Taylor will be Professor of
French at the University of London.
. The passing of the Oriental Hotel in
'Collins-street as one of Melbourne’s most
pleasant hostelries will be regretted, even
though it is to become the War Nurses’
Memorial Centre. Its owner, Pearson
William Tewksbury, 0.8. E., is as pic-
turesque as his pub. Born at Yackan-
dandah, he was the pioneer of gold-
dredging in Victoria and extracted a
million-pounds-worth of the ore off his
own bat. Subsequently he promoted
Yellow Cabs, the City Motor Service and
the Tewksbury Amalgamated Group of
gold dredges. He it was who originated
the Kitchener and Churchill Flag move-
ments, which raised £48,000 for Red Cross
and incapacitated soldiers. After he had
whipped up two million signatures for
the Churchill Flag, he was' the natural
choice as the courier to proceed to Eng-
land to present it to the British P.M. His
mother was a personal friend of Florence
Nightingale and wanted to go with her
to the Crimea, which possibly accounts
for his gesture in relinquishing his hotel
and accompanying it with a donation of
£15,000 to the War Nurses’ appeal fund.
He will continue to five in a suite there.

of my clothes and had to be refitted. So
I got a wide-awake hat, a coat with fancy
lining, bell-bottomed trousers and high-
heeled shoes —just like the schooner-men
used to wear.” It’s not difficult to pic-
ture the Commodore as a “schooner-
man” —crisp iron-grey hair, blue eyes,
heavy brows and a voice with a nautical
roll. After 6| years in sail —during
which he “heard of navigation for the
first time and decided to study it,”
learned that A.Bs. got £2 10s. a month,
and discovered ho.w to supplement a
meagre ration with “wind puddings”
(“head over the side, open your mouth
and breathe hard”) —he “knocked off
going to sea and went into steam,” and to
the beginning of a long and distinguished
career which he concluded as captain of
the Mary and Elizabeth. He carried
troops to and from Sydney during the
war, carried American troops across the
Atlantic and captained the Queen Eliza-
beth on her first passenger voyage after
the war—Molotov was a passenger and
said “No” to a vodka, but “Yes, yes”
to a whisky. According to Bisset’s esti-
mating the two Queens burned 750,000
tons of oil to carry 700,000 troops over
750,000 miles. He can also provide
authoritative figures (706 saved and 1502
drowned) on the Titanic disaster-—he was
an officer on the Carpathia, which rescued
the survivors, Scorfield drew this pic-
ture just before the skipper left for Eng-
land. He’ll be back here for good in a
few months.

a D.S.O. and the Polish Cross of Valor
for leading his battalion in a successful
counter-attack. Burrows was born at
Corowa (N.S.W.) in 1897. He went away
with the First A.I.F. as a private and
came back with a M.M. on his chest and
a lieutenant’s pips on his shoulders. After
the Tobruk chapter, in the second scrap,
he was promoted brigadier and had com-
mand of First Brigade from 1942 to
1945. Since retiring from the Army he
has been in Adelaide as manager of the
Cooper Engineering Co.
Dead at 69 at Bridgetown, Barbados,
Matheson Lang, British actor-manager
and author, who toured Australia in
1910-12. Born at Montreal, the son of
a parson, he was a cousin of Cosmo
Lang, a former Archbishop of Canter-
bury. Matheson Lang made his first bow
in 1897 in Louis Calvert’s company in
the English provinces; later with F.
R. Benson at the Lyceum, London. He
appeared with Mrs. Langtry and Ellen
Terry in a long list of Shakspearean
dramas, and in 1910 came to Australia
under Clarke Meynell and Gunn and
played the Stranger in “The Passing of
the Third Floor Back.” “The Wandering
Jew” ran for 12 months with Lang in
the part of Matathias. He' wrote several
plays and adaptations, the most success-
ful being “Carnival,” written in collabo-
ration with H. C, Hardinge. Lang
appeared in a long string of films, most
of them screen versions of his stage suc-
cesses.

man traffic superintendent of Adelaide s tram-
ways. He was visiting Dunedin, where he was
at one time a member of that city’s tramways.
His wife and two sons, George and James, live

sisters in Auckland.


Women’s letters
From Melbourne
This picture of Vivien Leigh does' not
tell in full measure of her flawless
beauty. Nor can it portray her charm,
personality and ever-changing expressions.
Her face is heart-shaped and she has green
eyes. Her dark hair is worn drawn back
from her face, and her figure is everything
a woman wants. At the press reception
she wore a Hardy Amies frock of gun-
metal crepe which had wide satin cuffs
and a narrow satin belt. A wide-brimmed
crownless hat with veiling tied under her
chin, three strands of pearls and a
glorious old eighteenth-century Spanish
cornucopia of enamel, rubies, pearls and
diamonds set in heavy gold completed a
fascinating picture. Sabrina, which she
plays in “Skin of Our Teeth,” is her
favorite role, but she also has a soft spot
for Juliet. She prefers the stage to the
screen, though she confesses that she
loved playing Scarlett O’Hara in “Gone
With the Wind.” Country life and in-
terior decorating are her favorite relaxa-
tions —she designed all the interior decora-
tions for their country house in Bucks,
and she chose all the eighteenth-century
furniture which adorns it. Her favorite
colors for furnishings are pale French
grey and blue. She has a 14-years-old
daughter, Suzanne, who is at boarding-
school and who is an excellent horse-
woman.
Should someone come up to you in the
street and throw a “zounds” or two, a
few “egads” and “Od’s-lifes” into the
conversation you’ll know he or she
has seen “The School for Scandal,”
the Sheridan play in which the Old
Vic. Company, beaded by the Oliviers,
opened its Melbourne season. Open-
ing night at the packed Princess
was a coruscation of jewels and
elegant gowns. Very lovely, too, were
the stage period gowns designed by Cecil
Beaton. Vivien Leigh’s first gown was a
charming creation of pale-yellow satin
heavily beaded on the front panels in rose
tones and worn over wide side-hoops.
Bands of deep-burgundy velvet crossed
on the bodice. A burgundy velvet cape
was later added to the ensemble. Beauti-
ful, too, was the black-velvet gown worn
in the Screen scene. The bodice was
tight-fitting, the slimness of the waist em-
phasised by a bustle. An enormous black-
velvet plume-laden hat was becoming.
The gala atmosphere was strengthened
by the presence of the Governor, Sir
Winston Dugan—a striking figure with
all orders and decorations —and Lady
Dugan, whose lovely full-length evening
coat of cherry-red taffeta was fitted at
the waist, the bouffant skirt featuring a
quilted hem and the full sleeves also
quilted. Her crepe gown in the same
shade had a knife-pleated skirt and an
off-the-shoulder bodice. Also in the vice-
regal party were Mrs. J. O. Haselden,
Penelope Nettlefold and Major and Mrs.
George Maxwell. Lady Herring, who
was with Sir Edmund and their two
daughters, chose a gown of midnight-blue
crepe. The Premier was with Mrs. Holl-
way, she wearing a gown of heavenly-
blue crepe. The Lord Mayor, Sir Ray-
mond Connelly, brought his fiance,
Patricia Holschier, who wore a gown of
pale sea-green tulle. Mrs. R. G. Menzies
and son Kenneth were with Mr. and Mrs.
J. Bowen Pain. Mrs. Menzies’s gown
was of white, pink and mauve floral
crepe ; Mrs. Bowen Pain’s draped gown
of sage-green crepe was encrusted with
silver sequins on the bodice. Mrs. Gar-
net Carroll, whose striking gown of black
grosgrain and velvet was appliqued with
gold-sequin roses, was accompanied by
Judy Wade, who flew from Sydney for
the opening ; Judy covered her midnight-
blue satin gown with a silver-fox cape.
Madame Rambert also flew from Syd-
ney for the occasion ; her pale-pink satin
gown flowered in tones of mauve and
grey had narrow ruchings on the skirt.
Coral Browne covered her Molyneux
gown of peach-pink romaine with a short
chinchilla jacket. The fitted and boned
strapless bodice of Mrs. Archibald
Aitken’s gown was of self-toned apricot
floral taffeta apd was allied to a skirt of
apricot-toned lace which *swept to the
floor in graduated frills. A cape-stole of
white fox worn over a slim-fitting black-
crepe gown was chosen by Mrs. S.
Aarons. A flowing Hartnell cape of tur-
quoise blue, the shoulders studded with
white beads, was worn by Mrs. Wallace
Mitchell. Mrs. Maurice Sloman’s draped
gown of cyclamen taffeta gained contrast
with a white-fox cape and a muff of the
same fur. Her daughter Barbara chose
a white gown and short white ermine
coat. Mrs. Maurice Sallmann’s bouffant
gown of deep orchid tulle was studded
with sequins in a deeper tone; a short
coat of platina added. Mrs. L.
J.. McConnan, who was with her hus-
band and daughter Bunty, chose a gown
of deep mauve, and over it wore a short
coat of silver-and-mauve striped taffeta.
At the reception given to the Oliviers
at Menzies by Charles Wilmot, represen-
tative of the British Council, Lady Olivier
wore a black frock of the new length, a
dyed-ermine cape which dipped to a deep
V at the back, and a black platter-shaped
hat with a cluster of long-stemmed pink
roses and violets set flat on the crown and
black veiling tied under the chin. Chat-
ting with Sir Laurence and Lady Olivier
for some time were the Premier and Mrs.
Hollway, she in an attractive jacket-suit
of aqua-blue and a matching hat trimmed
with brown coq feathers. Eileen Joyce
was smartly garbed in .a black-moire
taffeta suit and small black hat trimmed
with pastel-blue ostrich-feathers. Coral
Browne had silver filigree work on the
yoke of her black frock, which was
worn under a mink coat; her high-
crowned hat had coq feather trimming.
Mrs. J. W. Brophy’s grey suit had touches
of grey Persian-lamb on lapels and
pockets; her small hat was a grey felt.
Mrs. R. G. Casey chose a black jacket-
suit and a small black hat, which had
the brim outlined in hyacinth-blue velvet
ribbon.
The Rt. Rev. J. D. McKie blessed the
vows when Mary, daughter of Mrs. Guy
Smith, of South Yarra, and the late Mr.
Guy Smith, was married to Michael,
third son of Mrs. Keeble, of Kenilworth,
Warwickshire, England, and the late Mr.
Edwin Keeble, at Christ Church, South
Yarra. The bride, who was given away
by her godfather. Sir Robert Knox, wore
a filmy white tulle veil which fell from
a coronet of pearls lent by Mrs. lan
Mann. The gleaming folds of her mag-
nolia satin gown ended in a long train ;
the slim-fitting bodice had long sleeves
and a berthe neckline from which fell a
fold of Honiton lace which belonged to
her grandmother. Her bouquet was of
stephanotis, gardenias and tuberoses. The
bride was unattended; the bridegroom
was attended by Lieut.-Commander J. E.
Poulden,
At the reception held at Greenknowe,
the home of Sir Robert and Lady Knox,
Mrs. Guy Smith received the guests wear-
ing a frock of hyacinth blue and a black
hat veiled in blue lace and trimmed with
matching ostrich plumes. Mrs. Ernest
Poolman represented the ’groom’s
mother; her black frock was worn with
a short sable cape and a black hat
trimmed with salmon - pink ostrich
feathers. Among the many guests were
Mrs. Douglas Stephens, whose pink felt
hat trimmed with black coq feathers was
worn with a black frock and platina furs ;
Lady Clapp, whose biscuit felt hat carry-
ing a beige ostrich plume was worn with
a black frock ; Mrs. lan Millerv whose
coq-feathered black topper went with a
Persian-lamb coat; Mrs. Richard Watney
in slim black suit and white felt hat from
which white ostrich feathers curled round
to her chin ; Mrs.' Gordon Chirnside in
black moire taffeta suit and large natural-
straw hat; Mrs. John Howse, who wore
a dyed-ermine coat and a small halo hat
of pink roses ; Mrs. A. A. Lord in bright-
scarlet wool suit; and Mrs. Jim Fitz-
gerald, who allied black •jacket-suit and
small black flower-trimmed hat.
Lady Dugan, accompanied by Pene-
lope Nettlefold and Major George Max-
well, attended the first annual ball of the
Youth Group of the Royal Empire
Society, which was held in the Malvern
Town Hall. She was welcomed by the
president, John Bland, and secretary Joan
Cain. During the evening a small group
of kilted lassies and a braw piper danced
a reel and the Highland Fling. Lady
Dixon, president of the Women’s Group
of the R.E.S., was in blue and silver
lame gown and velvet evening-gown with
a silver-fox collar. Joan Cain’s white
taffeta gown had a deep frilled hemline
with a matching frill outlining the deep
off-the-shoulder bodice. Nancy Wood-
row, who was ticket secretary with Joan
Leggo, chose a taffeta gown in waterlily-
green ; Joan’s gown of white nylon carried
an imprint in deep-blue. Mrs. Norman
Spry’s ice-blue crepe gown was trimmed
with silver bead fringe. Mrs. Eric Cot-
trell allied black crepes and beige-fox
fur.
From Sydney
Thrilling broadcast of the week was
Monday night’s description of the Royal
Silver Wedding Celebrations. Family
parties gathered around the radio in prac-
tically every home and smiled happily at
the Royal progress from Palace to St.
Paul’s. Australia, like all the Dominions,
felt it was taking part in a family anni-
versary. And if the thoughts in each
heart could have been translated into
sound they would have sounded a silver
clarion-call around the Seven Seas.
Anzac Day was grey and wet, but
nothing damps the spirit of that immor-
tal day. Soldiers old and not old at all
marched in their thousands through the
streets on Sunday. Flowers, thousands
of them, in wreath sheaf and posy,
already decked the Shrine on Saturday
night. Around the Martin-place enclosure
men and women, girls and boys, and even
children were gathered long before mid-
night, keeping vigil till the Dawn Ser-
vice! Cars coming from the theatres
moved slowly on the roadway. Many
were coming from a play called “Born
Yesterday.” But these people, these
flowers were commemorating an heroic
epic, not born yesterday, but born in the
year 1915, and imperishable till the end of
all years and all days!
A pink handbill imprinted with the
masks of Tragedy and Comedy announces
that the Actors’ Ball will be on May 11
at the Trocadero. The handbill also in-
vites you to go along, at the cost of a
guinea, and dance with your favorite
radio, screen and stage personalities.
Kathleen Robinson, of Whitehall Produc-
tions, is president of the committee.
Among active workers are Hilda Scurr,
Lyndall Barbour, Ethel Lang, Bea
Wenban and the girl pictured here: Robin
Teakle, of Rose Bay. Robin is a song-
writer. Her latest song, composed in col-
laboration with A. J. Lawrance, of the
A.8.C., is “Hullo, Spring. This is Love! ”

Friends in every part of Australia will
be interested to hear that the L. A. Robbs
(he is official secretary to the Governor)
celebrated the 25th anniversary of their
wedding last week. They had a lovely
day. They lunched at Prince’s, and then
for old associations’ sake they dined at
the Australia. A night at the Ballet Ram-
bert put the final glitter on the silver-
wedding jubilations. The Governor, on
tour of the far, far west, wired congratu-
lations.
What a peach June Clyde looks as the
heroine in “Born Yesterday”! Even
when her clothes are all wrong she looks
a bit of all right in them. For in this
play the leading lady, Billie Dawn, is a
sort of millionaire gangster’s girl-friend,
straight from the chorus. Cicely Court-
neidge, whose own show “Under the
Counter” only ended its hilarious run on
Friday night, watched and applauded
vigorously from a box. With her were
her leading man, Thorley Walters, a toy
koala (afterwards bestowed on lead-
ing man Hartley Power) and the Dick
Allens.
J.C.W.’s publicity chieftain Eric Wahl-
quist was there, looking pleased, and his
attractive wife was noted in the audience.
Pat Glass, in a swaying frock of pink
chiffons, was one of the glad audience.
The H. J. Bradys, just back from a motor-
ing tour in Victoria, were dress-circle
front-seaters. The Harry Moxhams,
Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere, Mrs. Roy Mc-
Caughey, Mrs. Olding and Kathleen
Robinson were among the many.
Air Vice-Marshal Malcolm Henderson,
R.A.F., is no more considered by wind
and cloud than you or me. He was held
up by weather two days in Maoriland,
and his plane dropped him in Sydney
just about the hour the Overseas Leaguers
were rallying for his first Sydney party.
The drinks were going round and round
when he made his appearance in the
Gloucester-room of the Australia. He
looked a bit tired but as neat as a new
pin, having managed a “quick change”
in record time. The air-marshal has
been in Maoriland for that country’s
Overseas League Conference. Now he is
in Australia for the conference here, and
the party was given so that delegates
might get together.
Noted when the three were together
that neither the air-marshal nor air
knight Keith Smith have the inches of
Admiral Moore. Mrs. Moore, who came
with the admiral, wore a raspberry-red
outfit. Sheila Barton’s toque was a
graceful top-piece. Mrs, Williams, a
delegate from Brisbane, wore the “new
look” in her frock of French grey. Mrs.
Nicholas came with Beulah Bolton, of
the Victoria League. A frock of soft
woollen in dusty-pink was worn by Mrs.
H. V. Jones ; a sleek finish was her silver-
fox cape. Sydney secretary Kath Gaden
looked her smartest in silks that were a
soft jade-green, and a small and smart
afternoon hat of sapphire-blue.
Over from Melbourne are John Kauf-
man and his good-looking wife. Their
home, Dennistoun, is one of the show-
places of Mount Eliza. The gracious old
house is surrounded by gardens which
are a miracle of tree and flower and
vegetable. One corner of the grounds
runs sheer to a private beach, and the
seaview is free and wide. Mr. and Mrs.
Kaufman are renewing acquaintance
with favorite spots around the harbor-
front. One of the first places they re-
visited was the zoo. They will be in
this State for another month or so. The
Ballet Rambert snared them on Saturday
night, when her snow-white Arctic fox
cape was admired by every woman.
Coq feathers lifted themselves proudly
on the heads of actresses June Clyde and
Cicely Courtneidge at the J. C. William-
son cocktail-party last Thursday. June’s
were higher and more luxuriant than
Cicely’s. They were white, and each had
a little black blob on it —rather reminis-
cent of the little black eye in whitebait
after the poor things have said good-bye
to swimming in Maoriland streams.
Looked at with the poetic eye they made
you think of the proud Aztec. June
Clyde has a vibrant prettiness, and she
looks about as solid as a moonbeam.
Cicely looked pretty good, too. She, like
Miss Clyde, was slimness in black, and
her feet in their ankle-strap shoes took
tribute in the envious glance of every
woman.
The party was to introduce Hartley
Power, June Clyde and Stewart Long, the
stars in the new Royal show “Born
Yesterday.” Red seemed the favorite
shade. It was worn by Mrs. Alan Tory,
Mrs. Lashmar, and many others both
blonde and brune. Pianist Harry
White and his wife, actor Mayne
Lynton, now busy with “Julius
Caesar,” but looking forward to hob-
nobbing again with “Richard III” when
the Oliviers come, pretty Hazel Jackson,
just down from Japan, in a red frock,
very elegant, and a beret that was never
bought in Tokio, concert manager Bar-
bara Bennett ahd Mrs. E. Wahlquist
were among the many. Then there
was Mrs. E. J. Tait, her fragile
prettiness enhanced by black frock-
ing with a touch of pink at the
throat, and glossy dark furs. Add all the
theatre well-knowns, the newspaper and
radio writers, and lots of attractive girls.
There’s to be another of those pleasant
garden-parties which the Eastern Com-
mand Women’s Auxiliary organises so
well. It will bring color and animation to
the lawns before the Staff Corps Officers’
mess at Victoria Barracks next Saturday.
Each guest must bring a gift and buy a
gift. There will be tea on the wide
verandah of the officers’ mess. There will
be rides in a “duck,” as well as pony
rides for the youngsters. The War
Widows’ Craft Guild will benefit. The
Morshead lady makes opening speech at
a quarter to three, but if you arrive at
two you’ll be there for the real beginning.
Director of the Big Brother Move-
ment of N.S.W., G. Simpson Millar, is
rubbing his hands with pleasure because
21 “Little Brothers” from England are
arriving on the Orion this Wednesday
morning. They will be given a recep-
tion at 1 p.m. at the Y.M.C.A., when they
will be introduced to their “Big Brothers”
at whose homes most of them
will spend up to three days. Eight
or 10 of them will then proceed to
the movement’s War Memorial Training
Farm near Liverpool, where they will
receive several months’ training for work
in the primary industries. The rest of
the lads will go straight to selected
jobs already obtained for them in dif-
ferent parts of the State.

Resilience of earnings of this big hosiery
manufacturer over the last couple of
years reflects expansion of the undertak-
ing and speed in grappling with post-war
problems. Chief hurdles have been short-
age of labor, especially females in the
younger-age group, delays in delivery,of
new plant, scarcity of raw materials and
rationing of electric power, all of which
have delayed progress. Meanwhile, de-
mand has pressed heavily, and continues
to do so.
A policy of decentralisation has helped
to cushion the bump from labor, trans-
port and other difficulties. Including the
main factory at Brunswick (Vic.) the co,
now has nine manufacturing units at
work—seven in Victoria and two in N. S.
Wales —all housed in properties owned or
being purchased by the co.
Emergency generating plants have been
installed to lessen the risk of production
hold-ups owing to shortage of coal and
periodic failure of publicly - owned
electric-power supply. The flow of im-
ported silk, rayon and cotton yams and
of locally-produced woollen yams im-
proved, though not very markedly, as
the year advanced, and output benefited
—the co, produces about one-fifth of Aus-
tralia’s total hosiery requirements.
Shortage of yarn stood in the way of
marketing nylon stockings until early
1948. Technically and otherwise the co.
is well abreast of world developments in
the trade; staff has been sent abroad
and the most up-to-date plant has been
bought. Some of it arrived last term,
and more is to come; it should help
quicken output and sales and reduce unit
costs, thus strengthening the co.’s com-
petitive position. Appearances are that
plant capacity in the trade will exceed
local demand in the not-too-distant
future.
A record turnover sent the year’s gross
earnings (£214,756) up £78,312. Includ-
ing provision for taxation (£37,150, up
£9756), depreciation (£30,000, up £1910)
and cost (£2360) of the new piref. issue,
the growth in exes. (£181,055) was
£65,250. The net result advanced by
£13,062, reaching £33,701, which covered
pref. requirements and 15.5 p.c. on ord.
capital, compared with 10.3, 9.6, 9.6, 10,
40.3, 11.5 and 13.7 p.c. back to 1940. That
excludes £7500 shaken out of contingency
reserves, £7240 received on account of
female-wage subsidy and £18,750 over-
provided for taxation in the previous
year, mainly on account of War-time
(Co.) Tax. The £18,750, equal to three
years’ divs. on the new “C” prefs., was
added to pref. div. reserves (now £34,395).
The ord. div. was kept at 8 p.c., and has
been since a couple of points were chipped
off the rate in 1941. That left £12,904 of
the year’s net earnings to be ploughed in.
To help finance expansion 43,730 new
£1 ords., which brought in £10,119 of
share premiums, were put out in July,
1946. In September last 125,000 £l5 p.c.
“C” prefs. were offered and oversub-
scribed. That made paid capital £374,685
in 27,685 “A” 8 p.c., 50,000 “B” 6 p.c.
and 125,000 “C” 5 p.c. prefs. and 172,000
ords. On that lot pref. divs. and 8 p.c. to
the ords. will call for £25,224 p.a., or

All Sweetacres lines of chocolates and
confectionery, including Minties, come
from this co.’s large factory in Rosebery
(Sydney). Formed 30 years ago to
amalgamate two businesses—James Sted-
man, Ltd., and Henderson’s Sweets, Ltd.,
whose histories go back to the previous
century—the present co. has never en-
joyed the same earning-power, in relation
to capital as its predecessors. In part
this«is due to a considerable writing-up
of capital about the time of the merger;
in part to the severe competition among
confectionery-makers that emerged in the
early twenties, was Intensified after the
1930 depression and only relaxed when
war placed obstructions in the way of
output.
The co. is unable to grasp fully the
opportunities presented by the existing
sellers’ market because of the now
familiar deficiencies in labor, raw
materials and packages. In particular, it
has had to forgo much trade outside
N.S.W. Last term a small improvement
in the labor position followed the estab-
lishment of a “packaging unit” at Liver-
pool (outside Sydney). 1 This addition
hasn’t had much effect on the book value
of fixed assets, which actually showed a
net reduction of £847 last term, after
£19,782 had been written off to deprecia-
tion (down £779):

To reduce the mortgage by £11,500, add
£32,101 to debtors and £4561 to stocks,
the board drew on cash balances for
£21,934 and went ouside for £16,360.
Capital comprises 530,690 £1 ords. and
100,000 £1 10 p.c. prefs.
The board continues to avail itself of
the 1931 statute allowing a 22\ p.c. cut
in preference div. rates. Last year’s
profit, after paying this reduced div.,
represented 7.9 p.c. on ordinary capital,
compared with 7.2, 7.6, 7.1 and 5.7 p.c.
back to 1943. No details of tax provi-
sions or other expenses are published.
Payment of the full 10 p.c. to the prefs.
last term would have left 1\ p.c. available
to the ords., which received a 7 p.c. divi-
dend. The remaining £4721 raised net re-
serves to £55,163.
For the past 25 years Sweetacres pro-
ducts have been distributed throughout
Australia and N.Z. by the Nestle’s organ-
isation, which has no direct holding of
Stedman’s capital. The £1 ords., with
net tangible cover of 225. Bd., are cur-
rently quoted around 275. 9d., or
twice their pre-war value ; yield at this
price is 5 p.c. on the basis of last div.

There is evidence in that table of sound
progress, prudent finance and careful
management, which includes good buy-
ing and a tight hold upon controllable
outgoing. Certainly circumstances have
been exceptionally propitious; but the
pleasing feature is that the board has
made the most of its opportunities, and
has kept the div. moderate and very sub-
stantially strengthened the prop for
capital—over the last five years £66,817
was paid in dividends while £101,007 was
ploughed back into the business. Con-
sidering the history of the undertaking,
discerning shareholders will not quarrel
with such a policy, which holds prospects
of a steady and satisfactory rate of
dividend being maintained when the
economic barometer falls and price com-
petition asserts itself again.
Early in the piece—the co. took over
the then 19-year-old business of Mc-
Donnell and East in 1920 —there was
trouble with stocks; then reconstruction
of premises, largely on borrowed money,
and drought interfered with earnings,
and the ords. averaged only 4.5 p.c, for
the 10 generally fat years to 1930. The
next three years were dry ones, owing to
slump, and for the half-dozen to the out-
break of war shareholders averaged 4.3
p.c., with widening margins. For the
eight years to the close of last accounts
the .average was 6,3 p.c., with the very
substantial margins already referred to.
Excepting 1941-42, retail turnovers have
been steadily expanding since war began,
as the following table shows —it gives
percentage changes in aggregate sales of
a dozen Brisbane retail stores compared
with the corresponding period of the
previous year:

1947- .. +26.0 _ _ _
Sales for 1946-47 were nearly 87 p.c.
above the 1938-39 level. The growth is
due* largely to price increases, owing to
inflation, though merchandise has come
forward in better volume during the last
couple of years.
' Despite lower margins, the improve-
ment in the co.’s gross earnings
(£183,034) was £12,425 last term. The
growth in exes. (£136,217) was only
£2651, thanks to a saving of £21,000
/in provision for taxation (£29,000),
following abolition of War-time (Co.)
Tax. The net result thus benefited
by £9774, reaching £46,817, the best
yet. It was enough to cover the
small pref, div. and show 26.7 p.c. on the
£172,027 of ord. capital, compared with
21.1, 17.8, 15.1, 14.6, 9.4 and 6.1 p.c.
back to 1942. A point was added to the
div., making it 8 p.c.
Outlook for the current term favors
maintenance of a high level of turnover,
but costs continue on the up-grade. The
recent railway strike and waterside
workers’ hold-up affected country more
than city traders; the latter were mostly
well stocked when the trouble began. As
for price-control, everything, of course,
depends upon what happens at the com-
ing referendum. The present official
policy of shaving gross margins will spell
trouble all round when turnovers get into
reverse gear.
Co.’s finances are comfortable:

Mt. Morgan Pyrites
Announcement by Queensland’s Trans-
port Minister, J. E, Duggan, that the
State Railways has been asked to shift
50,000 tons of pyrites from Mt. Morgan
to Port Alma or Gladstone during the
next 12 months, with the possibility of
the tonnage reaching 200,000 p.a. or more
later on, suggests that Mt. Morgan, Ltd.,
is about to add another financial string to
its bow.. Mr. Duggan didn’t say who
made the request, but he mentioned that
there was about 3,000,000 tons of pyrites
at grass at the Mount. The heap is be-
ing continually added to from current
production, and the co. (Mt. Morgan,
Ltd.) has been seeking a market for the
stuff for some time.
Nothing definite about any contract for
sale has been publicly announced by Mt.
Morgan, Ltd., or anyone else. Two cos.
said to be interested are Broken Hill
Corp., Ltd., recently formed by Zinc
Corp. to take over its interests other than
mining at the Barrier (N.S.W.), and A.C.F.
and Shirley Fertilisers, Ltd. The dollar
famine, shortage of fertiliser and Zinc
Corp.’s big programme of expansion,
which includes large-scale production of
fertilisers, will create a demand in excess
of supply for locally-produced sulphuric
acid, one of the most fruitful sources of
which is the roasting of pyritic concen-
trates. The dump material at Mt. Morgan
would, of course, have to be treated for
production of concentrates before ship-
ment. Profit would depend on the dif-
ference between the cost of treatment and
the sale price of the concentrates.
The A.C.F.-Shirley Co. is about to in-
stall plant to roast from 3000 tons to
5000 tons pyrites annually. Zinc Corp.
has just offered to buy all the ord. capital
in Imperial Smelting Corp. (paid capital
£4,637,226 in 2,069,809 6 i p.c. prefs. and
2,567,417 ords.), the big English concern
which is about to set up a new zinc re-
finery and acid and fertiliser plants in
Australia. The basis of the offer is one
£1 Zinc share for every five Imperial
Smelting £1 ords.

In the enjoyment of one of our
"good” seasons we do well to
remember that drought will fol-
low in due time. Ours is a life of
thick and thin, of abundance and
of lean times.
Droughts are a part of us and
of our economy. They make the
Merino what it is and they keep
our soil sweet and healthy.
The lesson? That we cannot
afford to "go easy”. Hard times

Formation of the Queensland

of the growing importance of
metal production in the economy
of the northern State. The presi-
dent of the new body is J. Krutt-
schnitt, chairman of Mt. Isa,
Ltd. Foundation members in-
clude Mt, Jsa, Mt. Morgan,
Tableland Tin, Golden Plateau,
Zinc Corp., Broken Hill South
and Malcolm Newman. The aim
is to foster and stimulate de-
velopment of metal-mining in
Queensland, and protect the in-
terests of those engaged in the
industry, including the individual
producer and small syndicate as
well as the large co. Similar or-
ganisations in Westralia and Vic-
toria have done good work for
the advancement of mining in
their respective States.
* * * *
The North mine at the Barrier
(N.S.W.) has decided to sink a
new 4200 ft. haulage and down-
cast shaft about 2000 ft. north of
the present No. 2 main haulage
shaft; this because of the north-
ward and downward plunge of
the big lead-zinc ore-bodies and
the distance of present working
faces from No. 2 at the lower
levels. The new shaft is to serve
all levels to be opened up below
3070 ft., which is now being de-
veloped from No, 2 shaft. The
hew shaft will be a concrete-
lined elliptical affair, with a
major axis of 30ft. and minor
axis of 15ft., and will be
equipped with two large double-
decked cages running in balance,
two seven-ton skips in balance
and a small run-about cage with
a counterweight. The winding
equipment is designed for an
ultimate depth of 5200 ft. Wind-
ing speeds are to be 3000 f.p.m.
for the skips, 2500 f.p.m. for
the large cages and about 1200
f.p.m. for the small cage.

According to monthly returns
London-controlled North Kal-
gurli, operating on the Kal-
goorlie Golden Mile (W.A.),
treated 152,566 tons ore for
44,7150 z. gold, an average of
5.86dwt., for the year to Jan. 6
last. Corresponding figures for
the previous year were 129,283
tons, 42,3860 z, gold and 6.55dwt.
respectively, and the profit was
£36,375 (stg.), after providing for
taxation (£40,000) and deprecia-
tion (£2586). Two divs., totalling
£45,375, or Is. 6d. per 2s. share,
less income tax of 9s. in the £,
were paid. An interim 6d. per
share, less tax, has been sent out
in respect of 1947, but it is
doubtful whether the final will
be maintained at the previous
level of 50 p.c. (Is, per share).
Although abolition of the gold
tax added 17s. an ounce to
the selling price of the yellow
metal since Sept, last, the gain
has been more than swallowed
by increased wage and other
costs. At beginning of 1947 ore
reserves were positive 1,116,915
tons averaging 6.21dwt,, and
probable 431,430 tons averaging
5.54dwt. Fxom Sept. 17, 1947, to
Jan. 6, 1948, 3057 ft. of develop-
ment work was done, of which
1493 ft. (48.8 p.c.) was in ore
averaging 9.o2dwt. over a width
of 60in. All this is mostly above
No. 8 level (962 ft.), North Kal-
gurli shaft, where the drill has
disclosed a lot more pay-ore
above 600 ft. Ground below No.
8 level has yet to be tested. The
co.’s 2s. shares are priced at
30s. 6d. in the Australian market
as against 28s. a year ago.

SUNDRY SHOWS
"School for Scandal."
It is doubtful if Richard
Brinsley Sheridan would recog-
nise his offspring in the Old Vic.
presentation at Melbourne Prin-
cess. Nor would Rogers, Howe,
A. B. W. Lewis, Ada Reeve,
Nance O’Neill, Brough-Bouci-
cault, Marie Lohr, Allan Wilkie
and other past Sir Peters and
Lady Teazles. Footmen dance
out with tapers to the strains of
the Handel-Beecham music and
light the footlights, the facade
of Lady Sneerwell’s mansion
soars up and they rightabout-face
and march into her drawing-
room, and the dancing and the
music merge gradually into the
human action which lapses back
into the terpsichorean business
at the scene’s end. Then, without
a pause in the proceedings, the
action glides into Lady Teazle’s
bedroom.
That is the keynote of the
Olivier production, as with
“Henry V.” It appears to be an
attempt to marry the very latest
in modern stagecraft with the
atmosphere of eighteenth-cen-
tury theatre. In his mono-
chrome settings touched up with
a bit of color Cecil Beaton has
obviously gone to the old prints
fog. inspiration, and there is an
elegance about them which
matches the elaborate costumes
derived from the caricatures of
Rowlandson and Hogarth.
Accepted on its own grounds
of making artificiality look arti-
ficial, the show is the smoothest
presented for a long time in
Melbourne. There are no loose
ends. Lines are delivered, cues
taken, exits and entrances made
with faultless precision, and the
play goes without a hitch from
curtain-rise to the final ballet
which provides an anticlimax
to the drama.
Mr. Sheridan might ask:
“Where do I come in?” He was
concerned with showing up the
meannesses, hypocrisies, jeal-
ousies and hates of human beings
and the repercussions of an
elderly knight married to a
country lass young enough to be
his daughter. He gets a look-in
mainly through the admirable
character-acting of Olivier as
Sir Peter, worried to death by
the infidelities of his lady, in the
jovial robustness of George
Relph as Sir Oliver Surface and
Tony Gavin as Sir Harry
Bumper, in the excellent Charles
Surface of Terence Morgan and
in the giggling vivacity of Eileen
Beldon’s Mrs. Candour.
Vivien Leigh comes into her
own as a charming-looking
Lady Teazle with a perfect
enunciation, though with no
great penetration. Peter Cush-
ing’s Joseph Surface is all of a
piece with David Cunningham’s
Sir Benjamin Backbite and the
rest of the unconscionably
vicious circle, who are done in
a mood of exaggeration that
makes Laurence Olivier’s sober
losing himself in the part of the
old cuckold all the more effec-
tive.
"Born Yesterday."
Garson Kanin’s comedy at
Sydney Royal is the funniest
presented to Sydney since the
Independents played a version of
Jonson’s “Volpone.” It has, in
fact, particularly in the first act,
something in common with that
play; for all its modern smart-
ness it has the same gusty, ribald
vitality and bawdy wit that
reached for the stomachs of
Elizabethan audiences, and will
reach just as effectively in
another 300 years.
To “the most luxurious suite
in the most luxurious hotel in
Washington, D.C.,” come mil-
lionaire junk-man Harry Brock
and his cheap, dumb mistress
Billie Dawn, the millionaire’s
object being lobbying and
bribery for legislation that will
enable him to set up an inter-
national junk business. His target
is a sententious Senator and his
go-between, a crooked lawyer
who was once Assistant At-
torney-General. After meeting
the Senator and his wife the
junk-man decides that his mis-
tress’s lack of the graces is a
social handicap, and hires a
young newspaperman to educate
her.
If there is an Elizabethan
vitality in the way in which that
set-up is presented and acted
there are also shades of Shaw —
Billie’s defence of her unmarried
state (“If there’s* something I
want I ask for it, and if he don’t
come across I don’t”) is only
Doolittle’s “wife” with an
American accent before she fell
victim to middle-class morality.
And Doolittle’s wife, of course
—and so Billie with her—was
only a more recent expression
of Nora Helmer.
Overlying such Elizabethan
and Shavian qualities —and they
are the best of those qualities —•
is the modern American speed,
brevity and colorful idiom.
Brock’s complaint that, with her
lack of social graces, Billie will
“louse me up all the way down
the line” is more than a line ;
it’s almost an essay on Billie,
Brock and the American
language.
AU that is evoked by the first
act of the play. With the second
and third acts, although they
have sufficient energy, sauciness
and wit to keep the audience
howling like hysterical hyenas,
there is a subsidence into the
great American tradition of sen-
timentality. Billie, under the
tutelage of the newspaperman,
decides that her unmarried state
is not decent (Shaw was mag-
nificently consistent : Mrs. Doo-
little was forced into marriage
by m.-c.m.), sees Brock’s high-
pres'sure business methods as a
threat to democr *.y or some-
thing, and, after some high-
sounding palaver about the
rights of the little people and
suchlike, goes off with chrome-
plated visions of the democratic
State, a major slice of Brock’s
fortune and the intention of
marrying the newspaperman.
It would have been far more
consistent and credible —and
funny—had she shaken Brock
down by his own methods and
setup the newspaperman as a
junk-man, or gone off with the
Senator, or done anything at all
except go the same way as every
Hollywood heroine.
The serious intention under-
lying Kanin’s comedy is, of
course, an attack on human
greed, lobbying and political
corruption. Attack them he
does, simply and effectively
at first, by presenting them
with some touches of savage
satire, but when he gets
up on his hind legs and preaches
about the state of the nation and
the rights of the individual he is
no more inspiring than the
futile Senator he depicts.
Hartley Power plays Brock
perfectly—earthy and domineer-
ing, tough and ribald, something
at once both dirty and magnifi-
cent, like a pirate, June Clyde
as Billie was, on the opening
night, anyway, a little too asser-
tive for the demands of the
early scenes, and, in the later
ones, is handicapped by the
fact that hers is the most unreal
part in the play, but she plays
it for all the considerable comedy
it offers, and that is the im-
portant thing.
Stewart Long plays the rou-
tine role of the newspaperman
with more than routine ability,
while Eric Reiman as the lawyer
and Reginald Newson as the
Senator foil around nicely for
Power. Doug Stark’s clowning
is clever, even if it is some-
times as superfluous as an ex-
clamation-mark after a good
joke. Producer Gerald Kirby
dwells lingeringly on the comic
and farcical at the expense of
other aspects. Possibly an error
of judgment, possibly not. At
least he adds to the general
energy of the piece and distracts
attention from Kanin’s lapse
into sentimental unreality.
Hayward Veal.
An exhibition by artist Hay-
ward Veal at the Grosvenor
Galleries, Sydney, shows a wide
range of subject-matter and
treatment portraits, interiors,
landscape and sea-pieces, bush,
city and park, each handled
competently and with enthusi-
asrp.
The N, S. Wales Gallery
bought the large “Cove at Terri-
gal,” the best picture in the ex-
hibition. A smooth stretch of
beach and trees, with a gentle
ripple of waves and boats, it is
carefully drawn, yet with a sug-
gestion that the artist may be
capable of more powerful and
dramatic oil painting. A con-
trast is the rather Meldrumish
portrait of Meldrum, which
again is quite unlike a mono-
chrome portrait of A. Wolman
—sketchy, but with force and
character.
“Danny O’Sullivan’s Farm” is
a good painting, but disappoint-
ing. A large oil, it promises the
satisfaction of “Cove at Terri-
gal,” but, although its detail —
hay, buildings, fowls —is faith-
ful, and although there is a fresh,
lyrical note in the smooth green
grass, the picture, as a total
statement, fails to quite fulfil the
promise.
It is an ambitious attempt to
capture a mood of the earth ;
more light, perhaps, would
dramatise the fresh washed ap-
pearance of the green.
A number of silvery-grey,
nocturne-like studies of boats
present another and technically
impeccable aspect of Veal’s art.
“Leaning Pine, Rose Bay,” is a
good example of the artist’s im-
pressionistic technique, which, in
such pictures as “Bluff Tree Sap-
lings,” “In the Granite Belt” and
“Saplings at Yarramundy,” finds
richer expression in corners of
bush country. A couple of
bright interiors and a dark one
—of a studio landing—are in-
teresting as problems of tech-
nique, as also are some of the
Woolloomooloo and city street
scenes. In “Cobbity Church”
Veal has successfully tackled
problems of light and substance,
and “Early Morning Haze,” with
its subtle yet impressionistic
blend of greens, shadows, yel-
low grass and light, is a good
example of one of Veal’s favor-
ite subjects.
The exhibition, on the whole,
is satisfying with variety, sparkle
and charm and, in one or two
pictures and in the general range
and observation, promise of
growth.
Military Tattoo.
The military tattoo at Sydney
Showground on April 23 and 24
was very well put on, and, in
spite of it being a cold, wet night,
was well attended and was an ex-
cellent advertisement for the
Army.
Most of the military events in
the programme —it is a pity they
were not all military, but the re-
sources of the Army are limited
—were performed by recruits
froln Greta with only a few
months’ training who made a
magnificent showing. To obtain
the full effect of their excellence,
however, greater numbers were
needed, but no doubt this will
be remedied in future displays.
The culminating feature was
an air raid by two Dakotas
driven off by 3.75, and followed
by a ground attack in which all
arms were involved and in
which all military weapons
known to science were used ex-
cept teeth and flammenwerfer.
This was remarkably well done
with ingenious effects which pro-
duced —on the onlookers, at any
rate —an illusion of complete
reality.

WORLD CHAMPION AT 16 !
Andrew (‘Boy’) Charlton astonished the world by
winning the Olympic 1500 metres swim title in the
then world’s record time at Paris Olympic Games in
1924 when only 16! A few years later, at the
Olympic Games at Amsterdam, he went within an
ace of winning the 400 metres crown, going under
to Zorilla (Argentine). Charlton finished sixth in
the final of the 400'metres at Los Angeles in 1932—a
fitting climax to a brilliant swimming career.

The Labour President of the Board of

stated that it would be proper to inform
the House of the attitude of the Labour
Government toward the future of British
Insurance business. The Government, he
stated, had no intention of interfering
with the transaction of Insurance business

Johtl Mayow " " Air is necessary both to keep
a fire alight and to maintain life. Though this
important fact has been known for thousands of
years, it was an English chemist and physican,
John Mayow, who first proved by practical experi-
ments that only a part of air supports life and that
there is a great similarity between breathing and
burning. This part of the air, which we now know
to be oxygen, Mayow called the “nitro-aerial
spirit." He kept a mouse in a jar of air closed by
a bladder and observed that the bladder bulged
inwards probably with the contraction of the air
inside as the mouse used up the oxygen. He also
observed that a mouse alone in a closed jar lived
twice as long as a mouse kept in a jar together with
a burning lamp, showing that both mouse and lamp
were using up the same part of the air. ,
Though Mayow produced some remarkably
shrewd theories on chemical affinity and was one
of the first chemists to explain how nitric acid is
produced by the action of sulphutic acid on nitre,
his reputation rests on his work as a practical ex-
perimenter. He was born in London in 1643 and
entered Wadham College, Oxford, in 1658. He
died at Bath at the early age of thirty-five, a few
months after his election to the
Fellowship of the Royal Society.
John Mayow, English physician, was
one of several chemists who helped
to solve the riddle of combustion —
one of the most fundamental reactions
in chemistry.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL TUM.
It’s not surprising that Midstream
progeny should have fetched top
prices at the recent yearling sales.
Apart from bagging a very choice
share of the big prizes, they’re
consistently in the money at the
ordinary run of week-to-week meet-
ings. At Canterbury on Saturday,
Percy Miller’s imported stallion was
successfully represented by two win-
ners and a third-placegetter. In three
consecutive Saturdays the Midstreams
have taken four firsts, six seconds
and five thirds.
First of them to score at Canter-
bury was the ex-Melbournite Rio Fe,
a handicapping certainty if ever there
was one. In the nine-furlongs Bur-
wood Mixed Stakes, Rio Fe, as a
maiden, had 7.7 and claimed a 31b.
allowance for apprentice K. Barratt.
A fair illustration of the advantage
Mixed Stakes conditions provide
connections of promising, but un-
performed, gallopers. Rio Fe had
been entered for a Maiden Handicap
run at Brisbane this week, and in that
he would have had to lump the
ridiculous plaster of 10.5.
In the Burwood, young Barratt
rode a model race to land Rio Fe
a very easy winner from Barita and
Embark—another Midstream. The
other successful Midstream was the
four-year-old mare Parramatoo, taking
the Canterbury Park Handicap, also
of nine furlongs. Apprentice riders
were again seen to advantage in this
race; J. Waterhouse, still receiving
71b. allowance, though he won’t much
longer, had the winning mount, while
V. Haddrick, another seven-pounder,
was on Piccolo. It was a grand
finish; between Parramatoo and
Piccolo there was only a foot or
so, and Roatom was sandwiched be-
tween them to bag second money.
Yet another seven-pound appren-
tice, Bayley Payten’s lad R. Selkrig,
took the first Two-year-old Handicap
on the Nuffield colt Cadet. Selkrig
was as cool as you like in driving
Cadet along, with hands and knees
only, to down Cornelian, vigorously
belted home by the experienced
Thompson. Thompson missed out
again in the second Two-year-old,
his mount Blue Diamond being com-
fortably beaten by Grand Romance,
a full-brother to Flying Duke.
Over Canterbury’s odd 7-1-furlongs
trip, old Homeleigh Dick, surpris-
ingly backed to favoritism, downed
Star Vite and Young Veilmond, the
latter needing just that run to set
him for an early win. Success on
Homeleigh Dick was a nice sort of
present for the little Chinese rider
Teddy Doon, who the previous Satur-
day celebrated his 21st birthday and
the conclusion of his apprenticeship.
Thompson was again knocking at
the door in the first Welter (6f.), his
mount, Atherdon, being beaten a head
by Mirrigen (G. Moore). Such ill-
luck, three seconds from half a
dozen mounts, couldn’t last indefi-
nitely, and Thompson wound up the
day with a nice double, taking the
Campsie Mixed Stakes (Ilf.) on Blue
Danube, and the second Welter on
All Gold. He’d have to be awfully
stiff to lose the jockeys’ premiership.
# * * ♦
In Melbourne it was Flemington,
plus trimmings of the sort of weather
that earns Melbourne a standard
possie in the repertoire of Sydney
vaudeville humorists. It rained steadily.
It had done so for days; and the
track was a bog.
Wise was the punter who gave it
a miss. The success of one equal-
favorite was the closest the bookies
went to grief, in the course of a
card of six races. Ridden artistically
by A. Breasley, Manakau, starting
at threes, won the Hobson’s Bay
Handicap (13f.) from Lord Cavil and
co-favorite Magnina.
Round this time jumping events
should begin to take on some sig-
nificance, but Saturday’s Nautical
Hurdle was a dreary and meaningless
spectacle. Disappointingly, in view
of the excellent prize offered, only
four faced the starter and the race
early in the piece developed into a
match between Lord Beaufort and
Nantilla. After Charles Smart had
tossed his rider, the other runner,
Prester John, had but to complete
the course to bag a cut of the prize,
and this he did with grim deter-
mination. Despite bungling the last
jump Lord Beaufort ran out a seven-
lengths winner from Nantilla; the
official margin between second and
third was given as one and a half
furlongs.
Punters were evidently prepared to
give nearly anything a fly in the
10-furlongs Beacon Handicap for
three-year-olds. There were 10 starters,
and just half of them were at prices
from fives to sixes. Black Beau (H.
Badger), who won it, and Del Rose,
the runner-up, came from the other
half of the field; third was Lord
Bian at 11 to 2.
There seems something touchingly
naive about those who make any
horse a hot favorite for a race in
which 20 two-year-olds engage in a
mad scramble up the straight-six
course on a heavy track. Still, the
like exist, and they had El Faloos
as the “good thing” for the Break-
water Handicap. El Faloos finished
third behind Gay Silhouette (T.
Unkovich) at 33 to 1 and Alabama
King (20 to 1). »
“ Don't be deceived , Tiger; he ain't as innocent
as he looks.”
Over the same course Reperio (B.
Eames), somewhat better fancied, had
a runaway win from Dual Gift and
Sir Charles. Reperio knocked out
the trip in 1.16 and Gay Silhouette
had taken \.\l\ ; the course record,
admittedly pretty close to a world
record, is Aurie’s Star’s I,Bs.
Young Bruce Eames, a tiptop little
rider, who was quite unjustly criticised
for his handling of Fresh Boy in the
last Melbourne Cup, completed* a
nice double when he brought home
the 33-to-l chance Vaninka in the
Beach Welter, completing the day at
Flemington.
* * * *
The Wagga Cup, run last week,
went to Collisun, giving owner-trainer
Frank Burt his second successive win;
last year he took the gold cup with
Clyde. Burt is an amateur rider of
merit, and rode at the meeting, but
he left the handling of Collisun to
T. Mullane.

As good a field as could now be
got together in Australia contested
the Alister Clark Stakes at Moonee
Valley on Monday, three Caulfield
Cup winners—Royal Gem, Columnist
and St. Fairy—heading the weights,
but ijf.’pe of them placed, Money
Moon just beating Fine Fettle, with
Valcurl third. Columnist was going
like a winner when he slipped at the
turn and fell.
* * * *
Midstreams carried on the good
work at the scratched-up meeting at
Randwick on Monday, Tidal taking
the Gallipoli Nursery (fillies), and top-
weight Bernbrook only just pipped by
the lightly-weighted Veilmond colt
Overseer in the Bridges Juvenile.

Rowed this year at Hobart, the
King’s Cup was won By N.S.W.,
represented by the Haberfield club
crew. West Australia was second
and S.A. third. Haberfield has for
some time been dominating Sydney
club rowing; they row an individual
style, considered most unsightly by
the purists, but sheer condition car-
ries them through. Merv Woods
again had a very easy win in the
sculling championship, and should be
one of our best bets at the Games.

Speechifying in London, Bradman
got on, to rather shaky ground when
he said: “Many people say the Aus-
tralians take cricket too seriously.
We think the boot is on the other
foot. You will find that the only
three men who have hit a century
before lunch in Tests are Australians.”
Between England and Australia the
score regarding excessive seriousness
is about equal, but the Australians
cannot he forgiven some of their
deadly exhibitions against the visiting
Indians, whose own carefree, picnic
brand of cricket was always a joy
to watch.
* * * ♦
A crowd of 19,758 was reported
at the North Sydney Oval for the
Wallabies v. N.S.W. match, and it
is certain that many of ’em didn’t see
much of the game. The Cricket
Ground, of course, was being used
for a League club match; a poor
show, considering the relative stand-
ards of League and Union in this
country, and the fact that the game
was Sydney’s first chance to see the
Wallabies in action as a team.
What could be seen of the game,
over moving heads, was spectacular.
The Wallabies won, 35-11, but the
play was not so uneven as the scores
indicate. Most of the Wallabies’
points came in a grand scoring rally
in the last 15 minutes, and Furness,
the N.S.W. hooker, clearly outhooked
Kearney; which, in retrospect, makes
the omission of Furness from the in-
ternational team the more surprising.
However, Furness isn’t much good in
the loose, and here Kearney showed
his ability by scoring three tries.
Marsden, the N.S.W. winger, with
fewer opportunities on the day,
looked as good as Tonkin. Bastes,
with a- glorious try from the half-
way line, showed that he is still,
probably, the best winger in either
code of Rugby, anywhere, and
Richards, playing as breakaway for
N.S.W., was one of the best players
on the ground.
The game revealed, above all, the
teamwork of the Wallabies, their
capacity to back up. Time and again
forwards ran and handled like
superior backs, were determinedly
tackled and always had, not one or
two, but the whole pack waiting to
take quick passes. In these rushes
Stenmark and Shehadie were out-
standing; as were Allan and Howell
in the backs. But the tearti itself
was the matchwinner. After their
successes, it would be a pleasure to
see them against the All-Blacks.

Most abo. pugs, whatever they lack
in finesse, at. least pack a match-
winning haymaker. So discovered
Mickey Francis (9.6), defending his
Australian bantamweight title against
Queenslander Elly Bennett (9.51).
Bennett had the now-ex-titleholder
down three times in the second round,
and knocked him cold in the third.
* * * *
In the first couple of rounds of
his Leichhardt bout with Bill Foley
(9.12), West Indies lightweight Frank
Donnelly (9.10) realised that he
had the upper dook. In the third,
and after, Donnelly showed signs of
easing up on it, and soon had the
crowd, who always prefer mayhem to
mercy, voicing disapproval in loud
and fruity phrase. Donnelly got
cracking again and won as he pleased.

Broad Investment Scene
Industry and business gener-
ally in Australia are still waiting
for something to turn up,
though hardly in the Micawber
manner. Almost any business-
man who already has a large
turnover for his products and a
personal income in the high-
taxation regions will first of all
consider whether it will be
ultimately worth while before
taking on anything new or addi-
tional, regardless of the public
demand that may exist for extra
production. He is waiting for
a political change of a very
economic character.
Taxation and price-control
are the chief obstacles to incen-
tive in the industrial world
today, though labor and material
problems are almost, as bad. All
these problems in Australia have
a political foundation. Canberra
“Labor” still exercises vast war-
time powers over all industry
and finance, and it is intolerant
of the rights of private enter-
prise and private capital, just as
it refuses to recognise the rights
of the Opposition in Parliament.
But, whilst it restricts private
initiative, taxes heavily the
profits from its enterprise, and
exposes it on every side to the
mischief and madness that
exist in various forms in the
trade-union movement, the
“Labor” Government has been
unable to replace the motive-
power of private enterprise with
any other adequate productive
force. Envy and opportunism
have been the chief agencies
directing Canberra “Labor’s”
restrictive operations against
private enterprise. Its acquaint-
ance with efficient production
methods is practically nil, and
it is embarrassed at all times
by its treacherous Communistic
affiliations.
In Australia it is impossible
to discuss industrial, financial or
economic matters of any kind
without coming up against the
question of politics. “Labor”
politics and trade-unionism
have become closely interwoven,
and Communism has moved on
a big scale into trade-unionism.
Canberra “Labor” proposes to
dominate the financial scene
even more than it does already,
and the heavy taxation that we
now bear has a definite political
and doctrinal basis behind it. It
is by no means all a result of
the war. The. interest burden on
the total national debt is not
much more than £BO million.
Income taxes alone totalled £207
million in 1946-47, and total
taxes were £413 million, against
£124 million in 1938-39.
Business and industry do not
expect taxation to come hack
to its pre-war level, but they are
justified in asking that it should
resume like its old
ratio to the national income.
And that is including the cost
of “social security,” since, dur-
ing an era of genuine pros-
perity—not the paper-money
variety now so evident —the im-
proved production techniques
becoming available to diligent
workers should bring about a
very real lift in the national in-
come. In other words, as pro-
duction methods improve we
should be able to afford old-
age and sickness pensions as
well as a higher living and
profits standard.
Stock - exchange investors
should be interested in this
broad aspect of our political
economy as much as in the more
immediate and obvious pros-
pects. Real industrial develop-
ment and increase in earning-
power will come only from a
change of Government or Gov-
ernment policy, and investment
funds capable of facilitating
genuine capital development can
be built up only through greater
productivity of the community
accompanied by greater real
savings. And, usually, real
capital investment only comes on
an adequate scale from owners
of considerable capital. The
proprietary side of industry
therefore must be allowed a
reasonable margin of profit if
the immediate demand for con-
sumer goods is not going to pre-
vent the creation of capital
goods manufacturing plant,
etc.: —in quantities sufficient to
broaden the base of our manu-
facturing capacity, which means
our ability ultimately to make
more consumer goods.
As it is at the moment, Gov-
ernments in taxation and trade-
“Do you think the half-fare is worth saving, dear ?”
unionists in wages are taking
away from industry too great a
proportion of industry’s income.
The trade-unionists are more in-
terested in buying consumer
goods than in helping to pay for
more manufacturing plant, and
the huge Government tax
levies are never put to work very
productively or efficiently.
There is a great demand ahead
of all our industries at the pre-
sent time. But if we are slower
than other countries in endeavor-
ing to meet that demand by
efficient output we shall suffer
badly should overproduction
occur overseas while we are still
underproducing at the high level
of costs that are a. feature of
our present, underproduction.
Price-levels are still rising over-
seas in many categories ; but raw
materials are steadying, and
some British motor-cars and
bicycles have been reduced, and
so have numerous electrical pro-
ducts in the United States, The
Chifley method of putting
“Labor” politics ahead of Aus-
tralian industry cannot much
longer continue without bring-
ing grave implications.
New Zealand Forests
After well over 20 years of
forestry scheming New Zealand
is conjuring up projects which
make those of the past look like
toys. There’s just this little dif-
ference between planning a
couple of decades ago and now:
pines then were mere seedlings,
today they’re big trees and must
be used. Forestry bigwigs from
Maoriland and Australia in con-
ference at Rotorua just after
Easter saw exotic forests stretch-
ing across once-waste pumice-
lands in the centre of the North
Island, and the crop was nearly
ready for harvesting. An officer
of M.L.’s State Forest Service
nearly took delegates’ breath
away with estimates for export
when milling and pulping of
these pines get into full swing.
This year M.L. will ship 10 mil-
lion board-feet of timber. A
decade hence the total might be
10 times as big if markets are
found, and by 1965 the figure
could be doubled again to 200
million feet.
To make these dreams real
State and private-company en-
terprises will have to step on it
as they’ve never done yet. A
State pulp mill to swallow up
16 million cubic feet of pine
yearly is on the planning-
boards to get into production by
1952. State timber mills at Mum-
para, Kaingaroa and Waipa
might have an intake of 100 mil-
lion cubic feet of trees by then.
Rivalling this, N.Z. Forest
Products, Ltd., M.L.’s biggest
co., with more than six millions
of capital, aims to spend £8 to
£lO million on development in
the next 15 to 20 years. One
ambition is to supply plenty of
_
grist for Australian mills making
long-fibred pulp into newsprint
and wrapping-papers. Chair-
man David Henry said in
March that 20-year-old pines
gave a yield of 60,000 super feet
of logs to the acre. And there
are 850,000 acres of exotic
forests —mainly pines and Doug-
las fir —coming to maturity.
Maoriland is getting Scandi-
navian experts to aid its own
foresters in the drive for forest
wealth. It’s a man-sized job.
What foresters can’t do is lift
what David Henry calls “penal
taxation” off the backs of
forestry concerns. Henry blames
taxes for mounting forestry
costs, and says Maorilanders
will feel the kick-back in higher
timber prices. Export timber
will be dearer, too, and this
might limit markets. Taxes
strike at quality, add to dangers
from fire and disease and keep
divs. out of reach of share-
holders. who might have waited
too long for something back.
New Zealand’s State Forest Ser-
vice is now with Henry and
others in demanding tax redress,
so the odds are they shouldn’t
have to spend much longer cry-
ing in the wilderness.

CORAL SEA VICTORY
The Battle of Pacific Communications
By "MACNELL"
[“ln all the war I think the greatest single check to the Japanese was their
defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea.. because they had been confident that they
would completely conquer Australia by the end of 1942.” —Admiral Wenneker,
German Naval Attache in Tokyo.}
Regarded in official circles as the
Battle of Pacific Communications, the
Coral Sea action’s importance was em-
phatic. With the repulse of an invasion
force headed for Port Moresby, Japanese
southward expansion was stopped, and
Australia was saved to the Allies as a
base destined to be the principal stepping-
stone in their advance through New
Guinea.
On January 23, 1942, less than seven
weeks after Pearl Harbor, Japanese
troops, moving rapidly down the Pacific
Islands chain, were able to occupy
Rabaul. Almost immediately afterwards
enemy aircraft from Rabaul bombed
Port Moresby. Despite retaliatory air
attacks, by April Lae and Salamaua were
occupied, with Buka and Bougainville,
as part of a two-pronged drive aimed at
Port Moresby and Guadalcanal, and
ultimately Australia and New Zealand.
On May 4, in the Coral Sea, the next
step of this swift spread southward met
its first check.
Opening Moves
A powerful Japanese force, compris-
ing three aircraft-carriers, heavy and
light cruisers and squadrons of destroyers,
left Truk on May 1. Two days later an
invasion force of a troop-carrying group,
supported by cruisers, destroyers and a
seaplane-carrier, approached Jomard
Passage, not far from the south-east toe
of New Guinea. The first, major, force
intended to operate south of the occupy-
ing group: the object of both was a sea-
borne invasion of Port Moresby.
When north-east of Buka, in the Solo-
mons, the major force split, carrier Shoho
and destroyer escort proceeding north-
ward to link with the invasion group as
air-cover. The remainder of the main
body continued south-east of the Solo-
mons, its intention being to act as a
buffer between Port Moresby and any
attempted Allied naval interception.
Port Moresby, considering the weight of
this threat from the sea, was defenceless.
But there are 30 hours’ steaming be-
tween Jomard and Moresby, and while
these enemy dispositions were being
effected a compact, hard-hitting fighting
force was converging to meet them.
It was just before dawn on the morn-
ing of May 5. A cluster of dark blobs on
the sea broke the even rim of the hori-
zon. Then it was light; and the shapes
of ships gradually formed from the dim-
ness of the sea —the harsh ugliness of
aircraft-carriers and the rakish beauty of
their destroyers. Rear-Admiral Fletcher’s
fleet-carrier group was fuelling. Lying
off just clear to the northward a fast
squadron, including Australia, Hobart
and Chicago, under the flag of Rear-
Admiral J. G. Grace, C. 8., R.N., waited
its turn. The American force was a
weighty one, with fleet carriers York-
town and Lexington,. five Sin. heavy
cruisers and eight destroyers.
With a carrier either side of her drink-
ing thirstily, fleet, tanker Neosho was
working her pumps to capacity. Fletcher
knew that his previous day’s air strike
against Jap shipping in Tulagi Harbor
had disclosed his presence ; and at 1030
(10.30) that morning a Jap reconnaissance
flying-boat spotted the Allied squadrons.
First Blood
The enemy carrier-launched aircraft
following the spotter found only a tanker
and destroyer Sims. Because of the
oiler’s queer upper-works she was mis-
taken for a carrier, and a large number
of planes made a major attack. Gallant
little Sims went down fighting under a
load of bombs, and the tanker was
damaged: at the cost of much valuable
Jap time, fuel and bombs wasted.
Allied intelligence was good. Fletcher
knew the invasion group’s position—its
composition and course made the objec-
tive certain—and detached Grace’s squad-
ron to bar its passage to Moresby.
Yorktown and Lexington lumbered
northwards after them to launch their
broods against the same transports.
Scouts from Lexington spotted the
enemy transports and carrier Shoho near
Misima Island, 160 miles from Fletcher’s
force. The American carriers went into
action —this was what they’d been trained
for. Both big ships increased speed and
turned into the wind. Black specks
raced down the flight-decks, dipped a
moment as they left, skimmed along just
above the sea, gaining speed, then climbed
their way into formation high in the
blue. When all were airborne the squad-
rons, tight and disciplined, winged away
Australia’s Share
In the meantime scouts from the
enemy’s main force sighted Yorktown
and Lexington. The Japanese at once
positioned themselves to the northward.
But again Fletcher moved unexpectedly
to the southward, thus avoiding a flight
of land-based bombers from Rabaul sent
to deal with Grace’s obstructionist force.
These waved into the attack at 1506
(3.6 p.m.) on May 7, 40 miles s.-W.
of Jomard Passage. They came in low
out of the westering sun, eight torpedo-
bombers, each a line of wing, two pro-
peller arcs, and in the centre between
them a black nacelle muzzle topped by
a glistening greenhouse.
The three cruisers were ready. Their
fire was accurate, forcing the bombers
to the north, flying high above the sea.
With the sighting of Shoho there be-
gan a prolonged and fierce battle. Again
and again the American scout-bombers,
loaded with 1000-pounders, snarled in at
mast height and planted their loads with
devastating accuracy. The Jap carrier was
caught with few of her planes airborne,
and, laced with fire from stem to stern,
she took the rest with her to the bottom.
One American pilot, plummeting down,
swerved when he saw the carrier topple
and slid his explosive load into the vitals
of an escorting light cruiser. She limped
away towards Jomard, With Shoho’s
fighter threat removed. Corsairs roared
up and down the transports, raking them
mercilessly. One transport was heavily
damaged. Then the squadrons reformed
and headed home, minus only two
planes.
to drop their torpedoes at nearly 1500
yards. Australia altered course violently,
and a torpedo slid past on each side,
Chicago wasn’t so lucky. As the spear-
headed tracks reached out for her she
swung her length with hard-over rudder,
but the last one of four punched her side
open.
The torpedo-bombers were drawing off
when one banked sharply and came in
again at Chicago, thinking to finish her
off. Her gunners waited till he pulled
his nose up, exposing the underbelly.
The lines of tracer reached out and
nailed him. He headed seawards in a
slewing rush, hit on his belly, bounced,
hit again and dissolved into a ball of
flame that leapt over the water like
snakes’ tongues. Four other aircraft were
downed.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Gravelsnatcher”: “Zake’s” explana-
tion (B. 31/3/ ’4B) that the typhoon, like
bathwater as it gurgles down the hole,
revolves clockwise in the southern hemi-
sphere, anti-clockwise in the northern,
clears up a mystery of my sailing days.
We were rounding the tip of Dutch
Neyp Guinea with a schoonerful
of indentured labor when the daddy
of all typhoons appeared, travelling
north, as we were. The Old Man made
some hurried calculations, swore luridly,
studied the approaching storm, shot the
sun in four places and arrived at a con-
clusion that brought grim lines to his
mouth. “Twenty miles,” he muttered.
“We might just do it.” With every,
stitch of canvas she’d carry and the out-
board revving, we raced before the storm.
So intent was the skipper on the typhoon
behind us that he didn’t notice the one
in front until I drew his attention to it.
He blanched ; then his eyes narrowed and
a smile played around the corners of his
mouth. “We’ll do it! ” he cried. “We’ve
done it!” he ejaculated as he swung
the ship around at right-angles to our
course and kept her on a dead-straight
line. I’ll never forget that trip. For
eight.hours we raced along the Equator
with a frustrated typhoon snapping and
snarling on each flank. Neither could
come closer without reversing the direc-
tion of rotation, and once a typhoon
does that it’s shot. But we still couldn’t
afford to laugh. Half-way through the
show the cook came up with a culinary
problem. The sink was full and the
"Here's your shaving-water, sir, and I've prepared your bath."
water wouldn’t run out, being unable
to run clockwise, as in the south, or anti-
clockwise, as in the north. If those
typhoons hadn’t blown themselves out
we’d have had to take a chance with one
of them—you can’t play around with an
angry cook.

“Billy T.”: The westerlies are upon
us. Hats fly, trees bend and groan, bones
chatter and normally mild children rush
screeching about as though chased by
witches; but the howling gales bring one
joy to the eye: visibility which could pot
be surpassed. Along the coast haze dis-
appears, white-caps are seen miles out,
headlands out of sight in summer now
stand clear at the end of the wriggling
line of surf leading away to them. Over
the Divide each ridge has its shade of
color, from lush greens in the foreground
to deepest purple against the sunset; and
out on the plains you can see to the edge
of the world. But it’s from the air that
the change wrought by autumn rains and
the westerlies becomes a revelation.
Cleared of haze and dust, our inland air
takes on a sparkle which acts on dis-
tance like good glasses; once, from be-
tween Jerilderie and Narrandera, I could
recognise features of both Canoblas and
Buffalo; the mountains are about 300
miles apart, but the elevation, 5000 ft.,
brought both on to the skyline. Even in
summer our haze is far from the world’s
worst, despite our “dead heart”; to-
wards the end of the pre-monsoon “dry”
most of India lies under a dust blanket
which reduces visibility to a few murky
miles —at 10,000 feet you seem to slide
along on top of it, and when the weather
breaks the clouds just wrap you right in.
So, although there is a coat across the
foot of my blankets tonight and I’ve dug
out the old balaclava, I know that in the
morning I’ll pick out each beam of the
bridge where the road climbs the range,
that each puff of smoke will rise clear as
the Mail takes the bend beyond, that as
far as I can see up the river the trees will
reflect the colors the frost gave them,
and I’ll stamp my numbed trilbies and
reckon it’s worth it.

“Mat’s Mate”: About seven miles from
Forbes on the Gunningbland-road we
came across a cove sitting on a suitcase
in a clump of box-suckers. “G’day,”
he said. “G’day,” we said. “S’hot,”
said he, “Too right,” we agreed. Conver-
sation languished as Mat and I sat on
our knots and cooled off. Presently the
cove asked, “Was you blokes thinkin’ of
tryin’ that house over there for a hand-
out?” “Why?” countered Mat. “Ain’t it
any good?” “Aw, it might be all right,”
he said. Followed a further hiatus. Then
the suitcase-sitter said, “Go on, give it
a go.” Mat eyed him. “Why don’t you
give it a go?” “Aw, they know me!”
he said. Mat stood up. “Well, they
don’t know me,” he said, and made for
the house. He was back in 10 minutes.
“How’d y’ get on?” asked the cove
eagerly. “All right,” Mat grunted.
“Seemed a nice woman. Gimme a smile
an’ a good hand-out,” “Was she sing-
in’?” “Why, yair. Yair, she was,” said
Mat, mystified. The cove got up and
grabbed his suitcase. He fished in a
pocket and handed Mat five bob. “Here,”
he said. “You an’ your mate have a
drink on me when y’ get t’ Bogan Gate.”
He started across the road, stopped, and
looked back. “I bin away a week,” he
said. “Had t’ see how the land lay
over there. That’s my missus was singin’.
She’s all right when she’s singin’.” In
deep thought we watched him go blithely
through the gate and up the track,

“Eastern” : Sandy hadn’t been on the
rabbits in the station paddock long be-
fore he spotted the big ringnecked one
and marked him down. A week later he
had his traps on the burrow where he’d
seen the “pie,” but on each round he
collected only grey pelts. Then he sighted
the white-neck on the far side of the
paddock, and shifted his traps, to collect
nothing but greys again. During the
weeks that followed Sandy hunted that
bunqy with traps and dog, getting madder
each time he glimpsed the white-neck
squatting challengingly in the distance,
The rabbits were growing scarce in the
region when Charlie Danvers rode up
and offered Sandy a liberally-supplied
patch on his own range. The old rabbiter
declined reluctantly. “But you’ve got
this skinned out pretty well,” protested
Charlie. “You’d make six times the
profit over in mine,” “I know, I know,”
mourned Sandy, “but a man’s got a bit
of self-respect, hasn’t he?” He shook
his head at the view. “Not only that,
“If there s anyone under it I'll make him yell!”
but it’s the effect on the others,” he
pointed out. “Gripes, don’t y’ see, there’ll
be no livin’ with the flamin’ things till
I stop that blasted baldie bragging about
what he’s done to me.”

“Fang”: The rabbit inspector had
turned sour on the Hodges and was
gathering evidence to summons them.
He made his usual count of rabbits and
burrows and drove away with a smug
look. Ten minutes later he was back.
“Run out o’ petrol just past the gate,”
he explained. “Will y’ sell ms a gallon t’
get home?” “Well, I might make y’ a
deal f’r a gallon,” Tom admitted lazily.
The inspector, a hard man, sensed the
implications. It was 15 miles by lonely
bush road to his home village, and he
wasn’t prepared to leave his car un-
attended with the Hodges around. But
he also had a pigheaded sense of duty
on occasions. “Haw much?” he de-
manded. Tom blew a stream of smoke
through his nostrils from the cigarette
he was smoking before he answered.
“Two quid,” he said. “Same as they fine
y’ fr havin’ rabbits on y’r farm.” The
inspector was beaten and knew it, so
he paid up with bad grace and went off
with the gas. When he was out of sight
Dick turned to Tom. “Didn’t know we
had that spare tin o’ juice in the shed,”
he said. “Neither we did,” Tom ad-
mitted ; “not till I milked the measly
blankard’s tank while he was takin’ a
gander at the bunnies.”
“Bo”: The boss, who had had to wait
about 10 minutes while Big Joe searched
the hut for a new pair of greenhide laces,
waxed sarcastic about pansies for whom
a good honest bit of string as a bootlace
wasn’t flash enough. That stung Joe.
“I’ve got me reasons for always wearin’
greenhides,” he said. “An’ so would
you if you’d met with the accident I did.
Out in a back paddock of Mungudgie
once on me own I got mixed up with a
steer. Ripped me right up the middle.
I had no needle an’ thread on me, and
if I hadn’t done somethin’ quick all me
insides would ha’ fell out. So I bag-
sewed the 18in. gash up with me green-
hide bootlace after I’d made the holes in
the skin with a penknife. When
I went to the doc. about a month
later for him to take the stitches out
that greenhide lace had nearly bin et
through by my own vitamins. Now,
if I’d only had string laces they
would have dissolved on me almost
as soon as I threaded it through—an’
then where would I have bin?”
* ♦ * *
“Blime”: The boss was flat-out to get
his crop in before the predicted rains
when there came a sharp click, and the
tractor stopped. Wrathfully he pulled it
to bits, swore at the broken part, then
dashed for the telephone. He rang
savagely many times before realising the
vacillating fault in the instrument had
again cut him off from the post-office.
Barking his shins on a chair he kicked the
cat, and hunted writing materials, only
to discover presently that the ink-bottle
was empty. The combined efforts of Bill
and Barney eventually produced a pencil,
the boss finished his letter, and hurried
forth to learn the passing mail-car had
beaten him by just five minutes. His
roar jvas unintelligible, but, guessing his
intention. Bill hastened to open the
garage-doors while Barney rushed towards
the gate. The old bloke fell into the car,
and shoved a boot on the starter. Ten
minutes later the boot was still shoving
to an accompaniment of weak and dying
whirs. From the doorway Bill risked a
look at the dial behind the wheel,
beckoned Barney, and the pair were dis-
creetly disappearing up the paddock when
a small explosion sounded from the
garage. Reverently Bill removed his head-
gear. “I expected it,” he mourned sorrow-
fully. “Still, we couldn’t ’ve done any-
thing, Barney, He’d have blew up, any-
way.”

“Bosun’s Mate”: If Manus is still to
be an Australian naval base something
will have to be done to beat the worst
natural enemies we have there: the teredo
and bankia worms. Whereas the teredo
burrows straight up and down in wharf-
piles, the more destructive bankia bores
a |in. hole in to the pile’s heart and out
again, with channels cross-connecting,
thus riddling the wood. So far the Navy
has found the best antidote to be not
concrete or copper sheathing, but a
buoyant container round the pile filled
with fuel oil. It moves tidally, leaving
the exposed wood protected with a
viscous scum.

“Lower Tops’!”: Three “baby” sea-
elephants that recently arrived in Mel-
bourne from stormlashed Macquarie
Island have caused crowds to flock to the
city’s almost-forgotten aquarium and zoo,
where the amphibians are billed “as the
first in captivity” and “the first in Vic-
toria.” It would almost appear that these
huge seal-like animals were foreigners,
yet 150 years ago they abounded in Bass
Strait and on Victoria’s shores. In 1802
in one month the sealing gang landed
from the brig Harrington at King Island
killed 600. Nor were the huge snouted
swimmers unknown in Port Phillip Bay.
In 1803, when Governor Collins formed
his abortive settlement at The Sisters, near
Sorrento, and nine miles inside the heads,
the Rev. Bobby Knopwood tells us that
the barge crew from H.M.S. Calcutta
killed one on the beach which he de-
scribed as “twelve feet in length and with
the head of a bulldog.” Alas, a few years
later, because of the ruthless slaughter,
the sea-elephant departed from our shores
not to return until this year.

“Chuck”: Ron didn’t know much
about motors, but after a bit considered
himself competent to drive the second-
hand job he’d just bought, and felt mighty
proud as the truck chugged merrily
round the place. Then, on his way back
from town, she dwindled rapidly on the
home hill, and petered out. Ron lifted
the bonnet, and was scowling at the
engine in the approved manner when
Charlie Hodge rattled along. “Your
mixture’s too weak,” Charlie told him.
“I’ll fix her for y’.” Ten minutes later
he assured Ron his trouble was ended,
and went his way. Still the truck
wouldn’t pull. “Gripes, it’s y’r spark,
Ted Matheson said, coming to the rescue.
“I’ll alter it.” Ted went and was fol-
lowed by Robbie. “Had the same trouble
meself once,” Robbie announced.
“Brakes, it was. I’ll loosen ’em, an’ yll
be jake.” When Robbie and two more
bush mechanics, who did all they could
think of to the truck’s insides, had gone,
Ron sat down to work it out. Hed

BUSH BAROMETERS.
It is going to be hot
Tomorrow, the blue vapors mottle and clot
Into cloud, in long parallels all and about
Like ripples on sand when the tide has gone out.
Last night a green afterglow lingered on late
After the crimson that warned us of heat;
Now cicadas are shrill in the trees by the creek
And the wind has gone round with the sun for
week
From the east to the west, when he rises to-
morrow
The north will leap up from his slumber and
borrow
The red desert dust and the pinions of hell
And maybe a bushfire come roaring as well.
The bush birds are silent, the trees draw to-
gether,
Only cicadas still shriek for fine weather;
The lizards are lively, the cattle are not —
It is going to be hot.
It is going to change—
So close at hand now seems the faraway range.
Last evening the scud, all ghostly and grey,
Crept up from the colorless death of the day
And home to the marshes I heard the swans fly.
Over the dawn hung a red mackerel sky,
Now the hills are deep turquoise, the skyline
is dim
And low on the water the swift swallows skim.
Jays in the timber, clamorous and loud,
Cry down the sunshine and call up the cloud
And thousands of tree-frogs are trilling unseen.
Oh, watch while the gum-trees are changing their
green—
The small ants are climbing the pepper-tree boles
And big ants are building the mounds round
their holes
And still in the gullies the black jays complain
It is going to rain.

“Old-timer”: The shed was humming
along in great style, the sheep good and
the fleeces pouring from them to the
wool-table and bins, shearers, shed-hands
and everybody working harmoniously
and well. When Joe had to leave hur-
riedly to be with his sick father and a
new picker-up came there was no im-
mediate change. The new hand, Wally,
was a good and fast worker, a light chap
with snowy hair and one front tooth
missing. By the third day, however, the
greasies were irritable, the hands im-
patient and the boss rattled. Wally went
cheerfully on, whistling away. By the
end of the week there had been shouted
insults, hot words, an incipient smoke-oh
brawl and talk of a strike. At the week-
end men and- boys were sullen and
silent, only Wally was cheerful, whistling
his way about the place. In mid-morning
on the Monday big Fleming suddenly
dropped his sheep, leapt upon bis pen-
mate and tried to throttle him. There
was a brief free-for-all, Fleming altered
his position on the board and work went
on, in bitterness and barely-suppressed
hostility. The boss, worried, sought the
cook, a talented and thoughtful man.
“It’s Wally,” said the cook. The boss
was astounded. “It’s him whistling,”
added the cook. “You can hear him all
day and half the night, shrilling away
through that gap in his trap. It pene-
trates everything. It’s hell on the nerves.”
The boss didn’t believe it, but he made
an excuse to send Wally out with the
musterers for a couple of days and the
shed resumed its harmony at once.
Wally, bright and cheerful soul that he
was, went whistling off with the musterers,
and two days later was back to report
that in a fight one had broken the other’s
nose. The boss gave Wally his time and
a fiver.

“Plop”: I once came on a prophecy
that in a million years or so ants, with
their high social development, would re-
place our civilisation with their own. I
had thought they would have better sense,
but the writer’s theory was interesting.
They are very like us in their habits,
running, in the Amazon River districts,
to a fungus-eating species which operate
gardens in their hives, cultivating and
weeding their plot and even using leaves
as compost. For longer than man the
ant has kept his own “cows” —insects
which he milks for honey-dew—as it
uses other creatures as portable vats, and
for beef on the hoof. Lately a group of
American scientists has been studying a
glassed-in ant-nest. They found that 40
p.c. of the ants spent their day lounging
around in the nest, never venturing out-
side. Another 20 p.c. worked when the
spirit moved them. Only 40 p.c. were
good workers. That’s getting too close
to us for comfort,

“The 0.D.”: The suggestion that the
old theory—and I’m not saying I support
it —that white in an animal is a sign
of weakness (B. 21/4/’4B) fails to hold
in birds because a White Leghorn has
superior egg-laying capacity and a White
Muscovy is as big and tasty as other
ducks won’t bear examining. Superior
egg-layers though they be, W.L. fowls
“You Wont overcharge me for lamb again in a hurry!”
are sitters for diseases, changes of climate
and rough treatment that an Australorp,
R.I.R. or Brown Leghorn would regard
merely as invigorating challenges, and
that goes for white ducks of any breed
—if they’ve been as artificially reared as
the average feathered egg-machine.
Where the white animal does fail in the
Australian climate is in its susceptibility
to hot, bright sunlight; the pigmentation
of the skin being such that sun-scald or
sun-spot or whatever else you like to
call the rashes and eczemas break out and
the animal is kept poor by the irritation.
Put your white animals in cold and
snowy country and they’ll thrive.

“Rom Ney”: I was deeply interested
to read that “old Bob Matson went to
the siding to pick up half a dozen ewes
he’d bought at the city sales” (B.
21/4/’4B). Were they Friday specials or
did he get ’em from one of the stores
selling disposals goods down round The
Bulletin office?
* * * *
“Zake”: Dad Watson’s rain-gauge,
with which he was to measure and report
to the Weather Bureau the district’s rain-
fall, was his joy. True, he had not yet,
over the 10 months since he acquired it,
had occasion to use it. When the long
drought did break he was torn between
two emotions: a desire to see the rain
keep falling and the impatient urge to
read it after the downfall ceased. When
the last of the clouds had rolled away he
got the gauge, brought it in and put it on
the living-room table; then he went to
get his glasses. Just as he left the room
young Nellie came from her bedroom
choking, spluttering and panic-stricken.
As her eye fell on the rain-gauge she up-
ended it; it swilled down her gullet the
pill that had got stuck there. Then the
next storm broke.

“Awg Cawller”: I note that a Red
Page critic (B. 21/4/’4B) is somewhat
baffled by a passage in Marquis James’s
The Cherokee Strip:
Though what “a few oinking shoats in
the bed on their way to market” might be
passes human understanding.
Next time the critic goes bush let him
visit a piggery and listen to the young
pigs (shoats) going “oink, oink,” where-
upon his darkness will be lightened.

“Hanko”: We had intended going to
the circus, but having started to play
four-handed euchre for drinks we’d sort
of continued at it. After a while, when
we’d got so we couldn’t tell a king from a
queen, Baldy threw the cards into a spit-
toon. It was then that Lofty made a
hurried exit into the darkness. A minute
later and he was back, pale, trembling
and clutching his throat. “Flamin’ line,”
he gasped, gulping a neat brandy. “Nilly
tore me head orf.” With wild thoughts
of one of those mangy circus lions loose
on the doorstep we milled about in near-
panic, and Skeeter stole a nervous glance
down the passage that led astern. “ ’S
all ri’,” soothed the long bloke, waving a
brandy bottle in a wide arc. “Y’ can go
down th’ yard in perfish shafety now. I
shoved th’ clothesh-prop up again.”
* * ' * *
“Flathead”: When Bert Jeffrys started
to clear his block he decided that the
explosive is mightier than the axe. After
a month or so he became carelessly
familiar with the “jelly,” so that one
evening in Stacey’s when he reached for
his weed and struck a primed half-plug
in his pocket, he calmly walked outside,
lit the fuse and dropped it down the big
drain at the side of the pub. A few
moments later there was a dull “boom”
from below and a geyser of water shot
up to the ceiling from every sink in the
pub. Soaked by the phenomenon, Old
Harrison stepped back from the bar,
promptly swore off it for life, and has
played second cornet at Band of Hope
meetings ever since. Even now, after
nearly five years, whenever Bert fishes for
his pipe and asks, “Any of you blokes
got a match?” their conversation dies and
they spread like oil on water.
* * * ♦
“Macnell”: “Binnacle’s” navigator’s
Pilot (B. 14/4/’4B) is more than a travel-
book. It contains valuable seamanship
instruction: how to land through a surf,
plot the course of a typhoon, enumerates
the many inaccuracies —through parch-
ment-shrinking, shifting bottoms, etc. —
to which charts are subject, and the effect
of oil on rough seas. I remember the
night we put this last advice into prac-
tice. A seaman in a sloop was stricken
with acute appendicitis. The surgeon-
lieutenant decided to operate. A sloop
would roll on wet grass, and this night
the sea was logged “rough.” We streamed
oil-bags, pricked with a sailmaker’s-
needle, from the sounding boom and
poured oil fuel through lavatories. In
a few minutes she was dipping com-
fortably, and an hour later a bit of pink
gristle in a kidney-bowl drew half the
watch below.
* * * *
“Catspaw”: Fish, as well as bats, use
radar principles for steering. Water flow-
ing against a rock or jutting bank, or
another moving fish, is reflected in a rip-
pling pressure-pulse that beats against the
approaching fish. Along its head and
body is a lateral system of canals con-
taining sense-organs. These communicate
with the water through either pores or by
tubes holing their scales. Fishes, par-
ticularly in darkness, literally “feel” their
way.
« « * *
“Wippegong”: Have just been through
the Kiama (N.S.W.) district, where
once the trim stone fences, clear-
cut against the green rolling hills of the
Illawarra, gave the district a solid scenic
distinction; they are still there in num-
bers, but now their charm is mostly that
of picturesque ruins. The builders of
these “dykes” had good material —thou-
sands of tons of basalt gibbers lay around
that region—and doubtless they thought
posterity would bless them for their
skill and industry; they weren’t to know
they were building the perfect refuge
for rabbits. It’s doubtful if many
men have the special knowledge re-
quired to rebuild the fences correctly, yet
something ought to be done about it,
for, after all, that does seem the best
way to stack so much surplus stone.
A bloke might have dismissed these
passing features of our landscape
without further thought had he not
landed with his unit in a part of
Japan where the stone fence is asi im-
portant a factor in agricultural success
as is the incredibly foul manure-pit in
the corner of the paddock, and been
struck with the manner in which utility
was combined with beauty. The cutting
that led from our camp to the little fish-
ing village to the east was taken in hand
by dignified stone walls as soon as it be-
gan, guided gracefully through the saddle
of the hills and ushered gently down the
valley on the other side; and all terrace
walls were as ornamental as they were
useful. The best I saw were on the bleak
country between Yamaguchi and Hagi;
as the road climbs the “divide” in Honshu
the soil becomes poorer and the stones
thicker, so the peasant has unlimited
material to use and every reason to use
it. Here, where the streams are mountain
torrents and each village has its water-
wheel, the very beds of the creeks are
unobtrusively controlled by subtle stone-
work that saves both the man-made
terraces and the natural beauty of the
watercourse. Stone fences will always be
good in Japan, for the Nip is always
scratching for that extra square foot of
soil. We are not, so our stone fences,
like our windjammers, are sinking over
the horizon astern.
THE BUSHRANGERS.
Done with their daring deeds and dangers,
Far from the threats of jail and gyve,
I like to think that the old bushrangers
Ride as wraiths where they rode alive.
Do they visit their well-known haunts, I wonder,
In secret gullies and glens remote
And on lonely roads where they sought their
plunder
And in fenceless scrubs that they knew by
rote?
Do they come once more when the sunsets
redden
And creeping shadows the range enfold,
To wander again on the slopes of Weddin
Where once they buried their stolen gold?
Do they prance again with the old assurance
Through the silent streets of Jerilderie
Where they locked the limbs of the law in
durance
And held the town three days in fee?
Do the grey ghosts gather in glade and valley
And ride the hills as they rode of yore,
Gilbert and Gardiner, Hall and O’Malley?—
Outlaws and rebels; yet something more;
For they loved the open, and boot and bridle
And lifting lilt of a horse’s feet,
And danger to them was a beckoning idol
And battle to them was a joy to meet.
It was wild blood woefully misdirected,
It was bravery seeking a wrongful goal
With all laws broken and rights rejected
And bold youth roaming without control;
But they loved the gallop by star and moon
And the dangerous beds they left at dawn,
And they met with courage the armed platoon
And stood to the challenge with pistols
drawn.
And something of grandeur clings about them;
A cloak of romance still wraps them round;
And though the world has been taught to flout
them
Yet here and there may a friend be found
Who can lend an ear to a raider’s story
And spend an hour on a robber’s tale,
And find there is even a glint of glory
In lifting a load from the Western Mail.

ALL parts of Ronaldson-Tippett Engines are stan-
dardised and interchangeable, thanks to the use
of specially designed jigs, and to limit gauges
which are accurate, in the case of vital parts, to
limits of one-tenth-of-6ne-thousandth of an inch.
‘Alike as Two Peas in a Pod’ perfectly describes
the complete similarity of replacement parts in a
Ronaldson-Tippett Engine, so faithfully are
measurements duplicated in repetition work . . .
a comforting thought Indeed when the need for
spare parts arises. The effect of this infinite care
in machining is shown in the lengthy service
Ronaldson-Tippett Engines give. Ample demon-
stration is available in engines still operating
efficiently after 30 years of continuous service.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZCOS."
The Mules Method.
“R.N.”: At least three N.S.W.
stations, Boonoke, Gnomery
and Delamere, are convinced of
its value. It has been standard
practice on Gnomery since about
1943. R. B. Chopin, manager,
told the Australian Wool Board
that during a particularly nasty
fly wave in April, 1946, it was
decided to wean the lambs and
jet sheep requiring it. Because
of the drought Chopin had a
line of ewes, ranging from 2\
to years, boxed and running
together. Of these the 2\-, 2>\-
and ewes had been
Mulesed. On April 19 the re-
sults were summarised: Mulesed
ewes, 2889, number fly-struck,
three ; ewes not Mulesed, 3219,
number fly-struck, 225, or 7 p.c.
Chopin said the 7 p.c, did not
represent all the ewes blown, but
only the worst cases removed
for immediate treatment. All
this older-aged non-Mulesed
line had been jetted, whereas the
younger Mulesed ewes were
allowed to go directly into their
various paddocks. From April
19 until early in June only an
additional 38 Mulesed ewes were
treated for fly-strike. On the
other hand, the older ewes would
have had to be jetted again had
it not been for the shearing.
W. F. Buchanan, Delamere,
Pokataroo, told the Wool Board
he could not give up-to-date
figures as the operation is now
general on all his properties.
Bflt when exact figures were kept
the results showed that 1070
Merino ewe hoggets were treated
two weeks after general shear-
ing in July. In the following
January they were crutched,
lambed during March and shorn
again early in July. Over this
12-month period only seven tail
strikes were found and no
crutch strikes; only five ewes
died during lambing.
From Boonoke, Conargo, O.
McL. Falkiner has informed the
Wool Board that the Mules
operation as done at Boonoke
had proved itself, and it was in-
tended to continue it.
Polls in the Centre.
“C. Punch”: A couple of
Alice Springs cattlemen who
blew into Sydney at Show-time
are satisfied that Polled Short-
horns are the goods for their
country. S. Brown, of Stirling,
who has had 35 years’ experience
out there, defines them as good
doers, early maturers, quiet to
handle and good to travel, the.
whole combining to turn out a
good bullock for Adelaide mar-
ket. The polls, of course, make
shipping of fats by train a far
less costly business, since there
are no horns to bruise and
scratch the truck-load. G. D.
Leahy, of Alcoota, likes them
because there’s far less trouble
at watering, the hornless beasts
being quieter together than
horned mobs. Neither man has
any doubt of the polled cow’s
ability to defend her calf against
dingo attack; what she loses in
horns she makes up for with her
hooves.
Drovers’ Dogs.
“J.S.L.”; That notion of forc-
ing drovers to license their dogs
(B. 31/3/’4B) is the most out-
rageous idea I have ever heard.
Drovers’ dogs, almost without
exception, are always well
under control, and any footsore
and tired dog always gets a ride
on the cart. Most of the killers
which go bush are presumed to
be pets, and of all the crosses
I’ve seen only one was a kelpie
strain and only one a cattle-dog
cross. In these days, when it
is most difficult to get men
who know anything about
stock, travelling stock would
never get anywhere and sheep
never be mustered without
good dogs. Does “Dusty Mile”
imagine for a minute that
drovers don’t take very good
care of their dogs, when their
livelihood depends on it? Ask
any stock-owner close to a
country town what causes his
greatest loss and he’ll soon tell
you: the town dogs—Alsatians,
yapping Poms, fox-terriers and
the worst killer of the lot, the
greyhound.
Queensland Food Scheme.
“Agric”: No Labor prejudices
against the holding of land by
individuals are to be allowed
to stand in the way of the
socialistic farm scheme to be
undertaken in Queensland by
the British and Queensland Gov-
ernments. Only a socialist
would suggest that a Government
could farm land better than a
free individual, but the provi-
sions of the Queensland Land
Acts, .prohibiting a body cor-
porate from being granted or
holding a lease, and limiting
the area of land which may be
held, are not to apply to the
corporation, and, further, the
Co-ordinator-General of Public
Works is given power in the
“Queensland-British Food Pro-
duction Act,” passed on March
24, to resume for the corpora-
tion any land it may require “to
the same extent as if such activi-
ties were works authorised by
the Governor-in-Council under
the State Development and
Public Works Organisation Acts,
.1938 to 1940.”
For a start, the Queensland
Government, on behalf of the
corporation, is acquiring, by
negotiation with the owners,
250,000 acres of freehold land
within 100 miles radius of
Emerald for the growing of
“Were just plain folks, Strawb —you must take us as you
find us! ”
grain sorghum and other crops
to produce annually for export
to Britain half a million pig
carcasses. The Queensland
Government will contribute up
to a maximum of £500,000 to-
wards the £2,000,000 capital the
scheme is expected to require.
It is proposed to irrigate only
1000 acres for the growing of
vegetable proteins for use with
the grain fodder, and if the
250,000-acre scheme proves a
success it will, as Premier Han-
lon stated, mean the eventual
development of millions of
acres of blacksoil country ill a
similar rainfall belt.
During a period of 40 years.
Hanlon told Parliament, the
land it was intended to use had
had an annual rainfall similar to
that of the Dalby district of the
Darling Downs, but the Oppo-
sition contended that it was not
so much the total annual rain-
fall as the months in which the
rain was received which meant
success or failure in the Emerald
district. But such details are
unlikely to halt the experiment.
The Moulting Season.
“Shirley”: Most fowls are
now in the middle of the moult,
and. egg-production has fallen
—in small flocks it is practically
non-existent. Tendency is to
cut down on the food ration and,
as a beginner to the game, I
thought the same, and half-
starved the hens until they got
to work again. It was foolish.
Not only did it weaken them
when they needed all their
strength, but it postponed the
time when they were producing
again.
Moulting is a big strain on
the fowl. She needs plenty of
good feed, probably even more
than normally, to help her make
the new feathers before the cold
weather arrives. You don’t
want the hens caught by winter
winds when still half-feathered.
Give them plenty of warm mash
with meatmeal and boiled pota-
toes or household peelings,
A usually well-behaved flock
becomes fretful and bad-tem-
pered at this time of year and
will fight and quarrel incessantly,
sometimes picking at each
other’s growing feathers. If they
are well-fed they are less likely
to be restless. If it is a cold
climate be sure that the hens
have a warm shed. To have to
roost in an unsheltered place
when only partly-feathered will
hold back the progress of their
moult almost as much as in-
sufficient feed.
Planting an Orchard.
“Myrrhee”: When clearing
the land give it an extra ripping
to bring up tree roots, particu-
larly where armillaria is pre-
valent, If the fungus is extra
bad it’s safest to sow a field crop
each year for three or four years
before planting the trees. J, A.
Holbecke, in the “N.S.W. Agri-
cultural Gazette,” advocates
ploughing and subsoiling the
entire site, not only the strips
along the lines to be planted.
This gives the young trees a
better start and helps to locate
any stray roots missed by the
ripper. When subsoiling Hol-
becke recommends a depth of
15in., although in most areas
there are places where the sub-
soiler will rise to 12in.; m
others sink to 18in. On level
country a layout in straight lines
is permissible, but the contour
is recommended for slopes,
otherwise washes, at first hardly
noticeable, will develop rapidly
into gullies and scours.
A Sheep Decoy.
“C.A.L.”: Corora station
(near Broken Hill) used a suc-
cessful method of overcoming
the usual reluctance of sheep to
enter a shearing-shed. Protected
by stout wire-netting, a large
mirror was fixed inside the shed
close to the main entrance ramp.
The leaders, hesitant at entering
the door when they had been
forced up the ramp, seeing what
looked to be other members of
the flock already inside, would
run towards them. The rest was
easy. Then a ram espied an
opponent with head lowered ad-
vancing towards 1 him. He
rushed to accept the challenge,
and, breaking through the stout
netting, smashed the mirror into
a thousand pieces. Another
mirror was never installed.

there. The District Officer at
Kota Belud, J. S. Chisholm, has
been looking over cattle pro-
perties in central and northern
Queensland, which run zebus, to
see how they are faring under
Queensland conditions. He had
a look, too, at the Government
Experimental Station at South
Johnstone, where pasture - re-
search is being conducted. Chis-
holm said that if his Govern-
ment decided to buy Queensland
zebus it would probably buy
full bloods, three-quarter-, half-
and quarter-breds, to see how
they “nicked” with the native
cattle. Before the war North
Borneo ran about 15,000-head
of cattle, but today the total is
only about 5000-head, insuffi-
cient for local needs.
Bloat.
“Big Billy”: Removal of gases
from the rumen is the job. In
early stages the animal should be
forcibly exercised and the dis-
tended abdomen massaged with
the clenched fist. A wooden
gag across the mouth helps.
More advanced cases require the
rumqn to be punctured. Clip the
hair over the left flank, apply
a disinfectant and make a cut
at the highest point of the dis-
tended flank. Insert the trocar
and cannula in a downward and
forward movement with suffi-
cient force to penetrate the ab-
dominal wall and the wall of the
paunch. Hold the cannula in
position and withdraw the tro-
car to allow the escape of gases.
Mild cases may be dealt with
by dosing with sodium hypo-
sulphide 2oz. to soz. in a pint
of water or 2drms. of formalin
in a pint ofl water or a mixture
of 2oz. of turps with 15 to 20
drops of oil of peppermint in a
pint of raw linseed oil.
Bakewell the Breeder.
“Marsh”: The Leicester-was
the first breed that the famous
English breeder, Robert Bake-
well, set out to improve by
systematic selection and in-
and-in breeding, his aim to pro-
duce a valuable carcass, with
the fleece a secondary consider-
ation, As the types of Bake-
well’s Dishley Leicesters im-
proved he began letting out rams
for the season instead of selling
them. Eventually the idea was
accepted by many farmers, and
for one of his best rams. Two-
pounder, Bakewell received
800gns. from two breeders for
its service for two-thirds of the
season. Meanwhile Bakewell
was concentrating on improving
beef cattle and other long-wool
sheep. One noted authority
wrote that, “within half a cen-
tury of Bakewell introducing his
scheme for improving sheep
there were few flocks of long-
wool sheep in England, Scotland
or Ireland that were not in some
degree indebted to Bakewell’s
flock,” Few Australian sheep-
and cattle-breeders know who
Bakewell was.
Hints for the Farm.
“Billjim”: Mild cases of
scabby mouth may be treated
by applying 1 p.c. of lysol, mon-
sol or dettol added to 2\ pints
of water, to the affected parts.
Then apply an ointment com-
posed of five parts of monsol or
dettol, 10 parts of sulphur and
100 parts of lard or vaseline.
Repeat three times a week.
Severe cases are best dealt with
by washing and then painting
with tincture of iodine, finally
dusting with powder containing
two parts of boric acid and one
part of chloride of lime. Re-
peat as often as possible. Com-
bat the disease by vaccina-
tion ; serum is obtainable from
Commonwealth Serum Labora-
tories.
“Q.N.2”: One summer we
had a large surplus of cucum-
bers which we fed to our pigs
in the middle of the day, the
temperature being over the 100
deg. I don’t think they had any
great food value, but the pigs
enjoyed them more than water,
which was scarce and had to be
carted. Pumpkins are a good
standby, and can be stored, as
can swede turnips, which must
have had frost on them or they
will not keep. Sweet potatoes
are best of all for pigs of any
age and breed.
“W. Court”; With your oldest
clothes on, shovel out all the
manure from the lice-infested
fowlhouse and spread it around
the fruit-trees, well clear of the
house. Burn the nesting straw
and all cracked perches or other
fittings that would shelter the
lice during spraying. Sound
fittings will be covered by the
spray solution. Kerosene emul-
sion is the best spray, and it
should be used generously. You
will pick up many lice yourself,
the remedy being to jump into
the creek or a tub of water and
stay there for an hour.
“Hola”: Tall peas give a
greater return per square yard
than the dwarf varieties be-
cause they can assimilate more
nitrogen, etc., from the air. They
are also timesavers when picking-
time comes, and they continue
bearing for a longer period.
Plant them on fences, etc., after
trenching and manuring the
soil. A trellis of string is help-
ful to them.
“Wifi C”: South Burnett
(Q.) dairymen are trying sweet
Sudan grass, a cross between
Leoti sorghum and Sudan grass,
which is expected to supersede
the common Sudan grass.
Evolved by U.S. scientists 10
years ago, it is somewhat more
palatable than ordinary Sudan.
Its seed is also different, making
it easy to distinguish between
the seed of sweet Sudan grass
and its highly toxic cousin, John-
son grass.
“Radian”: When a diesel
engine won’t start, although
everything seems in order, re-
move the fuel injector and pour
in a teaspoon of clean lubricat-
ing oil. Replace injector and
try again. Oil will usually boost
compression just enough to fire
the first charge of fuel.
“F.L.”: Better work may be
got from shovels and hoes if
they’re kept sharp. File or grind
hoes to an adze point; shovels
are sharpened on the concave
side. Hold the tool in a vice
and use a steady sweep of the
file; if an emery is used, watch
out for heating, which takes the
temper out of the cutting edges.
“Pythagoras”: To find the
bushel capacity of a tank, box
or other container, determine the
cubic capacity in feet; i.e.,
length by breadth by height in
feet, for a square or oblong con-
tainer, or height by radius
squared by 3.14 for a cylindrical
container. Multiply this figure
by four and divide by five to
obtain the capacity in bushels.
“Matro”; To keep a tarpaulin
or duck sheet waterproof, occa-
sionally stretch it taut, then rub
it all over with a cake of par-
affin-wax that has been slightly
softened. When the sun shines
the wax automatically melts and
is absorbed by the tarpaulin,
helping to preserve and keep it
waterproof.
“C.S.”: Sydney Sheep Show
begins on June 2, aqd, as a sort
of reminder to city folk, some
Merino studs will be displayed
in Martin-place alongside the
bus queues (when the idea was
first put up to the City Council
some thoughtful alderman said
the bleating of the sheep would
disturb the populace, not know-
ing that sheep bleat usually only
when in distress of some sort,
whereas the city populace has
become so used to being
“pushed around” that it doesn’t
bleat any more) and the Wool
Board is expected to have a
wool display, too.
“Harrina”: U.S.A. is waking
up to the quality of Australian
Corriedales, Tom Macfarlane,
of Cullingral (N.S.W.), having
taken 1000 guineas for one of
his special-stud rams and 20
guineas each for five s.s. ewes.
They’re going to Leabhart and
Anderson, Tipton (Iowa), who
bought a Cullingral s.s. ram two
years ago.

soonnslM
Then the Hon. Albert sat
down. Because he was clean-
shaven and looked good and
was referred to as the Minister,
the children thought he was a
superior sort of clergyman—
perhaps a kind of bishop.
AND now a new diversion
came with the late arrival of
Dr. Waghorn—the great Island
Missionary. He had now retired
from the missionary field —or
vineyard—but his fine alert face
and firm step belied his long
white beard and his nigh 80
years. But no one bothered to
look much at him, for the
reverend doctor had with him a
dark, fuzzy-topped islander, a
young man of 20 or so, who
was clad in a long white gar-
ment very like a nightgown.
Undoubtedly he was a convert,
and in his eyes was that indefin-
able soft confidence that is only
seen in those assured of salva-
tion. Savagery, head-hunting or
whatever pastimes had been his
had dropped from him under the
good doctor's spell. Now he
followed the doctor, silent, faith-
ful and living evidence of what
the missionary can accomplish.
He was being led straight into
heaven as some compensation
for the loss of all the delightful
wickedness of his native island.
On his journey heavenward he
carried the doctor’s umbrella
and Big Book.
Bombo —his name sounded
something like that —immedi-
ately became more popular
than the skeleton. And he
showed most concretely that
there was something in Em-
pire after all. It was like gaz-
ing on a tame tiger, or better, a
very wild tiger in a safe cage.
Bombo didn’t sit, though there
was room for him: he stood be-
hind Dr. Waghorn, and the sun
glinted in his black fuzzy hair
like bright moonlight on the fur
of a possum.
THEN the local member
spoke on the Ideals of Em-
pire. He spoke well, and he
very skilfully introduced the
ideals of his electorate (the
general elections were about six
months off). The local inspec-
tor spoke, and was very clear
and precise and not a little
superior because so many
teachers were listening. His in-
terest in little children was
almost overpowering, and had
been so ever since he became an
inspector.
Then Mr. Goodman spoke—
without his notes. He was
internally furious and out-
wardly ill at ease because his
wife had failed to put them into
his pocket when she changed her
husband over to the Great Occa-
sions Black. It was a great pity,
for he had a fine speech pre-
pared. Now he floundered—a
thing most foreign to his
character.
The thinnest of the aldermen
spoke. Brigadier Weatherspoon
of the Salvation Army spoke.
Two regular clergymen spoke,
and were hardly listened to, hav-
ing long worn out their interest
in their weekly religious- instruc-
tion.
A lay preacher spoke—not so
much because he was a lay
preacher as because he ran a
very successful soap factory.
And he was delightful, not on
account of the soap factory, but
because he couldn’t forget he
was a lay preacher. He howled
vehemently and pranced and
thumped. Why, or for what, no
one knew rightly, but it was
grand the way he did it.
Dr. Waghorn spoke, with his
hand on the shoulder of the
young savage. That was a
really effective touch and helped
to stave off a thoroughgoing
human weariness in the audi-
ence. It seemed, too, that mis-
sionaries had done a lot more
’for Empire than the soldiers
or traders. The children appre-
ciated the point, for there was
young Bombo in front of them.
Several boys and girls had by
now fainted and were carried to
seats under a fig-tree, '
BETWEEN the speeches had
come the “items”: Massed
school singing of “Advance
Australia Fair” and “Sons of the
Sea.” It was still quite decent to
boast of boys of the bulldog
breed.
The Rev. Horace Saywell
managed to score quite a big
point from “Advance Australia”
—from the line “with all her
faults we love her still,” ex-
plaining that the words really
meant “If she had any faults,
which she hadn’t of course, we
would still love her.”
This was magnificently re-
ceived, and the Rev. Horace
went on to prove that “we have
the best education system in the
whole world.” (The Minister for
Education said “Hear! Hear!”)
And what was more it was “the
best of all possible systems”—
loud cheers.
A nice little boy (his mother
was on the platform) recited
“Recessional,” and a somewhat
similar nice little boy (whose
mother was also on the plat-
form) recited “The Burial of Sir
John Moore.” And a third little
boy (mother on the platform)
rendered “The Flag.” And
several other little boys and
another girl were carried to the
fig-tree.
On the front of the platform,
table and chairs moved back for
it, was given a graceful little
tableau of Britannia and her
daughters—done by the girls. It
was really well done. And
the skeleton seemed to forget
that he was the oldest inhabi-
tant, and was visibly affected by
the vision of Britannia.
The Cadet Band played a
stirring march. There was the
ceremony of presenting a flag
to the senior officer of the
cadets. The wife of the Mayor
did this very prettily. Then the
Mayor congratulated heveryone
and hall concerned, and the
second-thinnest alderman moved
a vote of thanks and the second
lay preacher seconded. And the
children were told by the Mayor
that they ’ad a ’alf-’oliday—he
himself never got no ’olidays
when he went to school, which
lie seldom did, in those ’ard old
days.
Then “God Save the King” in
thankful fervent tones, and
cheers, three times three for the
Empire.
BUT that didn’t mean dis-
persal. There appeared now
from a basement, where mys-
terious rites had been perform-
ing all through the celebration,
a whole company of mothers
pleasant, happy-looking, laugh-
ing mothers mostly. They
trooped around and up and
down in pairs, each pair with a
wicker clothes-basket. In the
baskets were big buns and
brown paper-bags of lollies.
Each child took a bun and a
bag, and a loud and pleasing
confusion of sound arose. Occa-
sionally there was the jarrmg
note, suppressed but discernible.
“I’ll job you, Sawkins if you
say I boned two bags of lollies,
or “A big boy pinched me
lollies, boo, boo!” As the 101 l
and buns were being distnbut
Mr. Goodman, now much re-
covered, escorted fbe Great
from the platform. The children
dispersed, too, by the ad® »
and the one at the back street.
The very last visions of dis met
ness were those of the skeleton
tottering off, and th
islander in his nightgown faith

“Two Toronto ’teen-agers, kissing
goodnight, had to summon help when
they got their dental braces tangled.”
In view of the dangers attend-
ing this process the following
hints are offered for guidance.
Brief setting-up exercises, such
as flexing the arms, running on
the spot and up to half a dozen
press-ups are beneficial immedi-
ately before the operation.
To avoid contamination both
parties should first rinse the
mouth and wash the tonsils with
some mild disinfectant such as
lysol or methylated spirit.
Grasp the subject firmly but
gently round the waist (or other
negotiable portion of the torso).
Avoid, unless absolutely essen-
tial, pinioning the subject’s arms,
which should be induced to
assume a similar position.
Remove from the mouth any
pipe, cigarette, toothpick or
half-chewed straws which may
be present. The collar and tie
should be removed only on in-
formal occasions.
Inhale deeply through the nos-
trils and close the eyes, taking
care first to secure an accurate
bearing on the objective.
After that you’re on your
own.

The New Advocates
A feature of modern legal development
has been the creation of Courts and ad-
ministrative tribunals from which lawyers
are totally disbarred or in which they are
permitted to appear only by consent of
the other party. The trend can be traced
to socialistic legislation, apparently in-
tended to reduce expenses, to put both
parties on an equal footing and to keep
the alleged craftiness of technically-
trained lawyers from interfering with
the process of justice according to “equity
and good conscience.” .
Those aims—very , commendable in
themselves —have not been achieved.
Anyone with doubts on the matter should
attend some of the hearings before our
State Industrial Court, where many re-
markable scenes are staged by advocates
who forget th.it it is their duty to assist
the Court by placing relevant facts be-'
fore it. Union officials, disregarding
matters in dispute, use the Court as a
vehicle for propaganda. The official —
often a Comrade or fellow-traveller, hold-
ing our capitalist Courts in utter con-
tempt—knows that every explosive state-
ment he makes will be taken down by
reporters and given a good splash in
certain sections of the press.
The advocate on the other side is often
not much better. Neither party is trained
in the manner in which facts should be
presented and in the rules (evolved by
our Courts over the centuries) governing
the weight and relevancy of evidence.
Members of the Bench are compelled to
sift the evidence themselves, tempers be-
come ruffled when careful deliberation
alone is needed, and the Court’s time is
sorely wasted by those who constantly
squeal about the delay in the hearing of
their claims.
As far as cheapening of justice is con-
cerned, one might well reply: “Justice
at any price.” And for those who
imagine that the presence of the lawyer
will lend unfair advantage to one party
the answer lies in a study of legal develop-
ment. The history of any legal system
shows that a class of professional advo-
cates always springs up around Courts
which men set up to decide their disputes.
And now, in many of our Courts, we
have a new type of professional advocate
who, thanks to our Legislature, need not
take a course in law. For how often will
a person unused to the procedure of the
Courts take on his own case?
The Fair Rents Court (now abolished)
with its many non-legal advocates was a
good example of the futility of banning
lawyers. Those who did not employ
such an advocate were as hampered as the
litigant in a court of law who does not
employ a lawyer.
As for the fear of lawyers taking tech-
nical points to waylay the unwary, such
an occurrence can be blamed on badly-
drafted Acts. The ethical standards of
the legal profession are high, and cases of
counsel who fail in their duty to the Court
and to their clients are extremely rare. —
Careful (Q.).
Soldiers
I can’t agree that, campaigns “taught
soldiers to trust nobody” (B. 14/4/’4B).
My experience as an infanteer in four
campaigns was that you had to trust
everybody, and only when you placed
your faith in all those around you did you
begin to have that indefinable something
—morale. As an infanteer you had to
trust the “arty” when their shells screamed
a few feet overhead, you had to trust the
machine-gunners to enfilade your front
even if their own was in danger of being
overrun, just as they trusted you to do
your duty by them.
When you got over that first
helpless feeling of wondering if the
whole world was collapsing around you
and began to realise that, somewhere
behind you, cool and clever minds were
holding the threads of your life in cap-
able hands, planning moves and counter-
moves —that’s when you started to be a
soldier, and that’s when you started to
win your war.—A. J. McD. (N.S.W.).
Coalminers
“Enquirendum” (B. 7/4/’4B) wants to
know something about the coalminer. Yes,
he does play games. Young miners in the
north, south and western districts have
been first-class soccer players for over
40 years. Both sexes of all ages are keen
supporters of the game. Many famous
soccer players, past and present, such as
Masters, of Balgownie, the Jones
brothers, of Corriraal, could be men-
tioned. Inter-State and overseas tours
were, once frequent and will be again.
.Tennis, bowls, billiards, cricket and danc-
ing are just as popular in the mining dis-
tricts as in any other part of the Com-
monwealth.
Does he “write to the papers”? Pos-
sibly that’s the one thing he does not do
overmuch, but if anything annoys him in
domestic or civic affairs he is as likely
as anyone to rush into print about it.
Does he “fall in love”? If marriage and
birth statistics mean anything he certainly
is as ardent as the next.
Stamp-collecting? A number of them
go through the phase and grow out of it,
as most of us do. Does he back losers?
He’s one of the greatest gamblers going,
backing horses and the dogs with equal
zest, and losing equally with thousands
of others who try to beat the bookies.
Yes, he grows cabbages too, proved by
the many flourishing flower and vege-
table gardens in every coalmining town
and village.
Does he “send his kids to college”?
A few, perhaps, but he certainly sends
them on from primary to high schools in
thousands every year. Large, well-
equipped high schools are in every mining
“It’s his fault; he brought a firefly home for a drink."
district, and the miners’ children do as
well as and sometimes better than
children from other 'sections of the com-
munity.
The coalie is no better and no worse
than any cross-section of the people.
He is too often led by the nose by loud-
mouthed Communist leaders, but, that
much aside, he is a fairly-decent citizen
like the rest of us.— Cymru (N.S.W.).
Yes, coalminers do all those things.
They also have a weakness for buying
pianolas and/or motor-cars on tick, rac-
ing slow horses and fast dogs and netting
fish during strikes, much to the annoyance
of regular fishermen. Coalminers aren’t
pictured in verse and story, probably be-
cause of their native shyness or aversion
to publicity during the Rothbury
(N.S.W.) rumpus some years ago, they
smashed all press cameras, punctured all
press cars and bounced all pressmen in
sight. In the matter of taking baths I’d
say they lead most other manual workers
by at least four per week. —P. O. M. C.
(N.S.W.).
“Road Trains”
I’d very much like to meet those wes-
tern Queenslanders (B. 3/3/’4B) who
“came ,to the conclusion that ‘Diesel
road-trains’ could replace the proposed
railway construction in that area and do
it at a fraction of the cost.”
The U.S.A., which builds all its own
equipment and supplies fuel from within
its own borders, has developed the heavy
road-haulage vehicle almost as far as
possible, but the people who build the
roads have found that, to cope with heavy
commercial transport, they will have to
multiply their capital outlay and main-
tenance cost several times. Some of them
are looking very thoughtful.
Also, though trucking concerns’ use
some very big units operating under
ideal conditions—dirt-cheap fuel, rela-
tively light taxation and perfect roads
—in the last year for which I have
figures they handled, on hauls of
over 50 miles and with carefully-selected
traffic, just over one-third of one per
cent, of the traffic passing. The biggest
units —they’re barred from some States —■
are huge things, but their capacity is
under half that of a comparable rail
vehicle. Each needs at least one man to
operate it, whereas you can couple
dozens of larger rail-wagons to one loco-
motive and handle them with three.
Before you start your “Diesel road-
train” you have to build a road to suit
it, and for the same traffic density roads
cost as much as railways. You can count
on three times the track maintenance,
three to five times the power consumption
and 20 times the manpower. As all these
things have to be paid for eventually, I’d
like to know where that “fraction of the
cost” comes in.— Transporticus (Singa-
pore).
Right to Strike
This glorified “right” to strike has be-
come an oppression and should be dealt
with by law. When it was accepted by
the community, it was as a workers’ last
resort against employers guilty of sweat-
ing, against low working conditions and
wages. Today, strikes have degenerated
into a vicious weapon deliberately used
for political and, in Communist-inspired
disturbances, ideological purposes.
The worst strikes in Australia have
been directed, not against private em-
ployers, but against Governments, and it
is the people who are intimidated and
made to suffer. In Victoria, Govern-
ment trams were thrown idle, the people
walking or cadging their way to work. In
Queensland the openly-admitted targets
of the railway-strike were women and
children relying on trains to bring them
food.
There has arisen in powerful unions
a small group of men, not elected by the
people, who have and use power to dis-
rupt the country’s economy and well-
being. Yet the workers fought for years
a battle to eliminate such abuses in arro-
gant businessmen.
Even Mr. Chifley urges more produc-
tion to ensure a reasonable living
standard. Can anyone reconcile that
with a “right” to strike and halt produc-
tion? Australia’s economic and social
recovery is impossible while we are beset
by strikes, most of them Communist-
run. We are fundamentally a law-abiding
people, and strikes which affect our
natural heritage of decent living should
be as illegal as they are in the country
from which most of them originate.—
Macnell (N.S.W.).
Unessentials
For the last six years I’ve tried to buy
“three-decker” shoes —the only kind
which ensure dry feet during the Speck’s
winter. I’ve been told that there’s a
shortage of leather, yet shop windows
are crammed with leather-goods—hand-
bags, suitcases, attache-cases, note-cases
and the like for which fancy prices are
demanded.
While there’s “not enough leather” to
make “three-decker” shoes, judging
by the number of rubber-soled golf
shoes on offer one might assume that
every other Tasmanian is an ardent
golfer. But owners of utilities and
lorries particularly farmers com-
plain that they are hard put to it
to get tyres that will stand up to reason-
able wear. They are told that there’s a
rubber shortage.
Apparently there is a shortage of every-
thing we need and a surplus of unneces-
sary junk which uses up good material.
—Obelist (Tas.).
Monopolies
A basic argument for nationalisation
is that “the people, not a privileged few,”
control socialistic undertakings. T.-A.A.
advertisements also stress that “this is
your airline,” as though the individual
citizen really owned the concern.
There is no greater economic falsehood
than the claim that the people control
State enterprises. Authority over them
is exercised by a caucus in the name of
the people—a radically different thing.
Unlike shareholders in a public company,
who both vote for the directors and have
their say at shareholders’ meetings, the
people do not choose those who direct
Government enterprises, nor do they
necessarily benefit if profits are made.
Only when industry is competitive can
the individual citizen be the master of
it. The vital power of transferring
custom when satisfactory service is not
given is then assured. Whenever there
is monopoly, whether State or private,
there is almost invariably exploitation of
the consumer. Of the two, Government
monopoly is the worst. Private mono-
polists seldom enjoy legal status, and,
therefore, can be threatened by the rise
of rivals. They are also obliged to show
some restraint for fear of rousing public
feeling and bringing on themselves Gov-
ernment intervention.
A national monopoly is protected by
law from competition. The opportunity
it presents for fleecing the consumer in
the interest of State revenue is a temp-
tation few in office have the strength or
the desire to resist. — Morris the Tinker
(N.S.W.).
Not Too Bad
“C.M.” (B. 31/3/ ’4B) referred to this
“world of rackets and blackmarkets.”
True of some, perhaps, but as far as
large trading companies are concerned
the public gets a very fair deal.
Some time ago a friend of mine bought
a two-ounce packet of a well-known
smoking mixture and found threads of
grey flannel all through the tobacco. A
pipeful was unsmokeable, so, rather
annoyed, he returned the stuff to the
makers —with a note hoping that the
workman whose shirt appeared to have
been processed had not been unduly in-
jured in the operation.
He received a reply from the makers
assuring him that his fears were un-
founded, thanking him for bringing the
matter to their notice and accompanied
by a quarter-pound of their best mixture
with the company’s compliments. Also
enclosed was an invitation to visit the
factory at any time to see for himself
that only by merest chance could any
foreign matter get into their tobacco.
As “C.M.” would say, it was a nice
gesture, and I venture*that most large
Australian companies would react in the
same way.— Ceg (Vic.).
N. S. Wales Education
The Centenary of Education in N. S.
Wales set me wondering whether we get
the best results for our money.
Four factors in education are the
children, the'* curricula, the equipment and
the staffs. The children are part pro-
ducts of a century of Government educa-
tion. The advice of every, teacher
in N. S. Wales was sought before the
present curriculum was framed, so it
must be reasonably satisfactory. Lack of
manpower and materials rather than
shortage of money is the main obstacle
to improving buildings and furnishings, so
eventually there will be less room for
complaint, although' at present a teacher
is far too dependent on local efforts to
equip his school. A more satisfactory
solution would be to place, say, a pound
per child per year at the disposal of
the teacher so that he could buy necessi-
ties for his class without constant dipping
into his own pocket or making humili-
ating appeals to an uninterested com-
munity.
Next come the teachers., Every one of
them has been carefully chosen, and each
at first tackles the job with unselfish en-
thusiasm. Then, after a few years, the
rot sets in, not because of the teachers,
but because of the supervision. What
other tradesman or professional man has
bis whole career dependent on the re-
port of an apparent superman who
watches him for only six hours every
two years? The teacher with a generous
inspector advances rapidly, while the
ped. under an inspector close with his
awards stays where he is. He may even
find himself dropped a thousand places
in seniority because of the opinion of
one man who may have sat at his table
for one day. A dissatisfied teacher may,
of course, appeal against an award, but
the appeal goes to the inspector who
made it.
I’m not against inspectors, but against
a system that can mean rapid promotion
to one and permanent debasement of
another who finds it difficult to work
with a boss standing over him. Again, a
teacher fortunate enough to have a class
that is bright, small and encouraged at
home pleases the inspector more than
the teacher with a school of perhaps 50
dull, sullen children in eight or nine
classes. In theory the inspector takes
all such factors into consideration when
making an award, but it doesn’t work out
in practice,— Pedo (N.S.W.),


The squadron had just reformed after
their twisting when high-level heavies
unloaded from 18,000 ft. This bombing
was accurate, Australia’s upper-deck
being drenched several times with
splashes. That was the closest they got.
Had Grace’s force been seriously
damaged the Japs would have pressed
on to Port Moresby ; as it was, what was
left of the invasion force turned and
headed back through Jomard Passage.
Therein lay Australia’s contribution to
her own protection. To make certain
of Moresby, Grace hauled off westward,
refuelled and waited.
The Main Action
These actions were incidental to the
main issue, and both heavies further south
were edging for position. Early the next
day, May 8, search planes from both
forces sighted each other almost simul-
taneously.
Fletcher’s scout planes, 175 miles to
the north near Jomard, reported two
enemy carriers and four heavy cruisers
standing s.-e, (towards him) at high speed.
Another scout found two heavy cruisers,
one of which challenged him with two
long searchlight-flashes.
With the position and size of his
enemy known, Admiral Fletcher prepared
to fight. To the west of both forces a
sub-surface arm of snag-toothed coral
hooked itself round them like a giant
sickle. South-west the empty immensity
of the Pacific stretched clear almost to
the Great Barrier.
Lexington shot off her fighters at 0900
(9 a.m.), one every 15 seconds. When
clear they orbited round the mother-ship
in a tight, fast circle, waiting for the
bombers. She launched 10 fighters, 28
bombers and 12 torpedo-bombers, leav-
ing eight scout-bombers as her fighter
umbrella. Yorktown put up eight
fighters, 24 bombers and 10 torpedo-
bombers. Thus the combined attack-
group for this crucial action totalled 92
planes, launched 160 miles from their
targets.
The sea was calm, visibility 10 to 15
miles through intermittent rain-squalls,
with slight cloud. At 1130 Lexington’s
group made contact with the enemy just
north of Misima Island.
They wasted no time. Owing to some
inconceivable oversight the Jap carriers’
planes were not all launched, though they
had 2i hours’ warning of hostile forces.
Two 5001 b. armor-piercing bombs an-
nounced the Americans’ arrival, one
blowing an ulcered crater on a carrier’s
flight-deck 50ft. from the stern, the other
bursting plumb in its centre. Dive-
bombers roared down, scoring five direct
hits on this carrier, with the torpedO-
bombers slipping nine of 12 torpedoes
home, all on the same ship. This was
later identified as the Zuikaku. Yet even
this hammering failed to finish her.
Shokaku Gets It
Throughout the engagement the enemy
ships were twisting at high speed. Lex-
ington’s group hauled off and York-
town’s bombers roared in for Shokaku,
the other carrier. She had just turned
into the wind—the perfect target. Of
the bombers’ cargo, 14 bombs struck
their target. One pilot attacked so
savagely that he planted his bomb down
the after plane-lift and was blasted to
pieces by its explosion. The last plane
coming in changed course and blew the
stern off Sfiokaku’s attendant light-cruiser.
When last seen she was sinking rapidly.
The torpedo-bombers, taking advant-
age of the initial* confusion, found the
carrier listing to starb’d and covered
wholly with petrol-driven fire. They
approached very close, and the carrier
turned left, then right. As she began the
starb’d turn, presenting her full length,
the torpedo-bombers let go. Ten torpedo-
tracks stretched towards her. They
reached her on the turn and peeled her
side open from waterline to flight-deck.
Three minutes after the last hit Shokaku
rolled on her torn side and sank beneath
a tombstone of smoke.
Climax
Meanwhile Lexington- and Yorktown
were preparing for their share. Full day-
light came to find all ships at action-
stations. They remained closed up until
at 1055 radar screens showed a large
group of planes, distant 68 miles. All
friendly planes on patrol were at once
called in. Speed was increased to 25
knots, working up to 30 knots.
The torpedo-bombers were sighted low
down at long range. It looked like York-
town first. Brown puffs of smoke broke
from her sin. batteries, increasing to a
rippling sheet of flame as the first flight
entered barrage range. Three torpedoes
ran in on her port beam, another four
on the port quarter, all of which, by skil-
ful seamanship, she avoided. Four
bombers smacked into the sea.
The first bomb struck the flight-deck.
It sheared through, and, its fuse started,
passed the hangar-deck, altered course to
starb’d, hit a beam, deflected back to
port, penetrated the third deck and ex-
ploded in the aviation store near one
engine-room. Thirty-seven men were
killed. Speed did not drop below 24
knots, and to a bridge query about slow-
ing-down the engine-room came back
with the classic report:
“Hell, no. We’ll make it!”
Two more bombs bursting in the sea
under her quarter lifted the screws' clear.
Another, hurtling down, clipped its
shoulder on the catwalk near a sin. gun
and exploded in the sea. It was the last;
Yorktown had no further attacks.
Lexington’s Fight
Meanwhile Lexington was fighting for
her life. Simultaneously with York-
town’s attack, torpedo-bombers bored in
at her wall-like sides. As they flew in
the bombers opened with cannon and
machine-guns, hoping to demoralise ex-
posed gunnery personnel. Black puffs of
flak followed them in, and a lacework of
tracer glowed as planes and target ex-
changed fire.
At 1120, a few minutes before the
carrier’s own planes fell upon Zuikaku,
the first torpedo hit her forrard; a
minute later another exploded beneath
her bridge. There was a viper’s-nest of
oerlikons ranged near the bridge. The
following plane came in range, and
almost as one the line of barrels flared.
Tracer stitched into him, and in an in-
stant the aircraft’s fabric opened up like
a rapidly-spreading sore with red edges
and yellow centre. The fire swept to the
tail. In a moment the plane became a
framework skeleton. Three more tor-
pedo-bombers were blown to pieces.
The Japanese attack was now fully de-
veloped, .with dive-bombers carrying
1000-pounders falling headlong out of the
sky upon her. No narrative can do jus-
tice to the action that was now joined.
The sky was dirty with smoke. Bofors
and oerlikon shells streaked out like red-
hot meteors, colored lights thrusting
vehemently against the sky in a confused
and fiery pattern —and above the din of
gunfire the duller, louder sound of ex-
ploding bombs.
A big bomb landed just off her torn
bow and a wall of water washed her
flight-deck. She was being hit continu-
ally, each time quivering with the sud-
den upthrust of bursting steel. Another
1000-pounder razed No. 6 gun and its
entire crew, and exploded its 1 ready-use
ammunition in a searing blast that
caught the crews of Nos. 2 and 4. A
smaller bomb exploded inside her funnel,
holing it like a Swiss cheese. Then two
big ones ripped her side open.
She was done. Internal explosions of
ammunition and high-octane gasoline re-
duced her innards to a shambles. Through
burst hatches and doors glowed the dull
red of fuel-fed fires. The forward ele-
vator lifted suddenly above the flight-
deck. At 1707 Captain Sherman ordered
“abandon ship.” Men jumped and slid
off the burning hull as she drifted at two
knots down-wind. Individual acts of
heroism by the score were performed
aboard the carrier, in the burning water
and on rescuing destroyers.
At 1950 two tremendous internal ex-
plosions shook her to pieces. She sank
at 1952, transformed in a few hours from
a proud fighting-ship to a twisted tangle
of metal.
Yorktown landed on the rest of her
planes after sunset. With the last one
snugged down the Battle of the Coral
Sea ended.
A few months later, after the great
October and November naval actions at
Midway and the Solomons —on question-
ing, Commander Sekino, Jap Staff Com-
munications-Officer at the Coral Sea
action, stated that sinking of Shoho and
Shokaku and Zuikaku’s crippling lost
Midway for the Japs-—the enemy rea-
lised the futility of trying to maintain the
initiative in either the western or eastern
leg of their original drive, and retired to
form a defensive airfield-chain along the
northern coasts of New Guinea and New
Britain.
And so, through the courage and fight-
ing efficiency of our own and American
naval men, this country was saved from
the imminent threat of a Japanese in-
vasion. And what that would have meant
we know now only too well.
Out of the Fire
When one of Australia’s finest depart-
mental stores —Charles Moore and Co.,
Adelaide —was recently destroyed by fire
a feature of the disaster was the interest
displayed by the firm not in quest of a
new building, in salvage operations, or a
hundred and one matters that crop up at
such a time, but in the welfare of the
staff. The emporium was still smoulder-
ing when the chairman called the 400
employees together in a city theatre to
discuss their future plans.
How the employees appreciated this
gesture was shown by their signed letter
of thanks in the press. Refreshing in-
deed after a welter of strikes and class-
hatred.
Another fine gesture was that other
stores offered to employ Moore’s staff
until the store is rebuilt. The firm itself
was inundated with telegrams and letters
from manufacturers with assurances of
help to restock.
It’s not such a bad world. —Adelaide
(S.A.).
The Wheat Agreement
Australian farmers are displaying little
faith in the wheat agreement signed at
Washington by Mr. Makin. Remember-
ing how France jettisoned the Bretton
Woods monetary agreement the moment
the shoe pinched her, long-thinking
farmers realise that few of the 33 con-
sumer countries which signed the I.W.A.
will continue buying wheat from Aus-
tralia the moment they can get it a penny
cheaper from Argentina or Russia —the
two exporting countries not parties to
the agreement.
According to calculations worked out
by the N. S. Wales Farmers and Settlers’
Association, Canberra control of wheat-
marketing has resulted in growers being
short-paid £74,250,000 from the proceeds
of four crops (1943 to 1946), and
the I.W.A. will cause a further loss of
£63,000,000 on the 200 million bushels
delivered from the 1947-48 crop. The
treasurer of the F. and S. says total losses
would reach £137,250,000. F. D.

The Bank Grab i
As reported in the daily press, the I
Minister for Munitions, Senator J. L. 1
Armstrong, at the A.L.P. Regional Con-1
ference at Goulburn; “The Bank Nation- 1
alisation Act would be brought into effect \
by referendum or other means if the j
High Court held the Act to be uncon- i
stitutional.” (
Does the “or other means” imply that, I
should the Court and the people (by j
referendum) reject the legislation, it will i
be rammed down our necks forcefully? j
And has Mr. Chifley suffered, such a i
change of heart that he is now willing to J
permit the people to express an opinion i
on the legislation through the ballot-box. J
Or is he cynical enough to think that by j
the time the Courts have done with the
case the people will have forgotten their !
hostility?— C. V. (N.S.W.). j
Root of the Matter j
I have just received a handsome volume 1
entitled “Displaying Australia.” It is very j
well done but for one thing, and that is i
the continued reference to all sections j
of the American fighting services, with i
virtually no reference to Australian or j
Dominion services. I noticed only two \
references to Australian troops, one being j
a picnic landing on the New Guinea i
beaches, and the other a wounded Aus- j
tralian being taken out while the Ameri-!
cans were obviously going up to hold)
the line. The volume was published in i
America, so perhaps that gives the j
answer.—G. S. McL. (London). i

For half a century the N. S. Wales I
South Coast railway has been unable to J
extend beyond Bomaderry because of the i
difficulty and expense of bridging the !
Shoalhaven River at Nowra. Since the i
building of a railway to Captain’s Flat, J
however, there is a much easier way of i
taking a line farther south. Sixty miles J
of rail from Captain’s Flat along two i
natural valleys would bring the line to J
the coast at Moruya. At £7OOO per mile 1
the cost would be £420,000. The railhead i
would then be a starting-point for any 1
extensions farther south to Narooma, I
Cobargo, etc. A connection from some j
Point on the Nimmitabel-Bombala rail- 1
way to Eden on Twofold Bay is also over- 1
due to open up this district. It could all i
be done while they’re still talking about |
extending the South Coast fine to Eden.

It would be a good thing for Queens-1
tend if tfye unions adopted the same rule i
as the public service, and stipulated that 1
nobody who had a conviction entered
against him could be employed by the
Un i°n. That would get rid of the Reds
who were convicted during the last strike, 1
and prevent them from giving such ques- 1
tionable leadership and ill-directed advice
in future— Repatriate (Q.).
I’ve just counted the contents of 22
random boxes of matches, marked
“Average contents 60.” One had 60, one
61 and one 62. The rest ranged right
down to 50’s, one having as low as 49.
The average was 55.36. If this is general,
the purchaser is robbed of one whole box
in every dozen. One box in a dozen is
83.333 in a million, and the profit on
83.333 cost-free boxes must be a tidy
sum, particularly when a firm sells many
millions of boxes a year.—P. S. B. C.

“Labor” had better do something about
the vast quantities of sugar still stored at
N.Q. mills (B. 7/ 4/’4B). Canegrowers
in the Mackay district have been warned
that, unless the storage space is cleared;
it will not be possible to treat the whole
of the crop. The cane will have to be
left in the fields for the wallabies, with a
consequent drop in income for canecutters
and mill-hands. These men earn the
greater part of their living during the
crushing season, and they won’t thank
Federal “Labor” if, after a number of
lean crops, they’re denied maximum earn-
ings in a long season. — Bill C. (Q.).

At present a motorist is at the mercy
of anyone who likes to call himself a
mechanic. Plumbers, electricians and
most other tradesmen have to prove they
are qualified to carry out their work, and
have to be licensed to do so. It seems
only fair that the motor mechanic should
be licensed, and then only when he can
prove to a competent authority that he
is capable of carrying out repairs satis-
factorily.—W. P. T. (N.S.W.).

A shipload of Dutch farmer-immi-
grants, vanguard of 40,000, is reported
from Canada. Calwell hopes to get 40.
The numbers might have been reversed
if Calwell’s “Government” hadn’t con-
vinced the people of the Nether-
lands, by its abject surrender to the
Communists of the waterfront unions,
that Australians were anti-Dutch and
all for “our Indernesian

Our small N. S. Wales
district has two sawmills
and cannot supply suffi-
cient timber for houses,
workers’ accommodation
and other buildings, yet
last month three inspectors
visited one mill, and told
the owner to stop work as
he had already cut more
than his quota for the
month. Before he can cut
more he will have to
obtain a new licence.
—Brebis (N.S.W.).
In some N. S. Wales
country towns at least, the
Chifley-McGirr “free” hos-
pital scheme is not exactly
the howling success its
sponsors expected. When,
some months ago, the $tate
Hospitals Commission pro-
claimed that private-ward
accommodation would
cost 10 guineas a week and
intermediate ward eight
guineas —less the Govern-
ment allowance of two
guineas in each instance
—but that public wards
would be free to every-
one, it looked as though
public-ward business would boom. Yet
there has been little or no increase in the
demand for public-ward accommodation.
Lismore Hospital Board recently issued
a statement explaining there was no
“catch” in the offer, but still the
patients pay. Hospital doles, it seems,
are no more popular than any other kind
with average country people. They
prefer to pay their money and take their
choice. — Simple Simon (N.S.W.).
