CADBURY’S COCOA is closely allied to
milk in the large proportion of flesh-forming and
strength-sustaining elements that it contains. It is pre-
pared on the principle of excluding the superabundance
of fatty indigestible matter with which Cocoa abounds
supplying a refined thin infusion of absolutely pure

Tales of the Early Days.
No. XVI.—The One Chance of Lifer Harley.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
BY PRICE WARUNG.
To every man comes his one chance. And
Convict Harley, absolutely (so it seemed) despised
by Fortune, was yet offered his. The boon of free-
dom was in his hands for one golden moment.
The thing for which he had hungered and thirsted,
for which he had laboured and sweated, for which
he had paid deference to vulgarity and been obse-
quious to vice, was in his possession. The glory
and the joy of Liberty were his —his—his !
Nevertheless, he threw it aside as something
that was worth nothing—as though it was of no
more value than the word of honour of a convict
overseer or the honesty of a lawyer.
* # #
The assigned servant of Mr. Philip Fleury,
the able and eloquent and detestably scoundrelly
Sydney auctioneer, Harley had congratulated
himself when from the post of book-keeper that
btilliant financier and unscrupulous rogue, his
iriaster, had promoted him to the managership of
his valuation branch. Fleury knew men and was
perfectly sure that Harley’s first crime had not
been succeeded by others. The sudden yielding
t) temptation which had occasioned his “being
sent out ” had also entailed so measureless a
heritage of suffering and remorse as to render him
impregnable to similar attacks thenceforward.
Fleury really thought so, and Harley, while
at first dubious of his own powers of resis-
tance, yet in his heart of hearts believed it.
The one fall, even when accentuated by the
thousand and one officially favoured immoralities
Of the Bystem, did not invariably kill the better
part Of d convict. Occasionally it strengthened
him because it tore away the veil which had hid
bis weakness from his own vision.
Harley, then, went in and out among the stained
souls which made up the major part of Sydney
population in the Thirties,—seeking to keep him-
self uneontaminated by the contact. Among
the wealthy villainy it was that Mr. Philip Fleury
found his chief patrons. Land and house and
shop property were becoming valuable in Sydney,
and enterprising gentlemen of the Fleury stamp,
having a fine instinct for smelling out a rascal who
Would “ eokuin ” a land-grant or who could induce
the Original grantees to disappear mysteriously
(rtevef to re-appear except in the form of a
skeleton in a Blue Mountain gully), had a
large and profitable clientele among the specu-
lators in “uueaniol increment.” And Harley,
being the confidential agent of a most expert
manipulator in most kinds of privileged roguery
and in many that were nut privileged, might
have made his fortune five times over had he
chosen to exert in his own interest the skill and
knowledge which he exercised on behalf of bis
master. But for himself ho would not lie; though
he would suppress material evidence in preparing
statements for the Board of Assignments and the
Executive Council. Again and again he knew he
was making false statements, and compiling wil-
fully erroneous “abstracts,” but the salve to his
conscience was that he employed no more
than the precise words of his instructions.
He was but an “ assigned servant ” without voli-
tion or voice of his own, and bound by a hundred
regulations to obey without demur or enquiry,
the command of the man into whose charge the
System, in a generous regard for his moral well-
being, had given him. Therefore, he reasoned,
the culpability was not his, but his master’s.
Let him, however, profit himself by such acts as
he was almost daily compelled to perform for his
master’s benefit, and he would be —once more—
a criminal. The circumstance that the act
might be no more heinous than several which
were weekly given effect to by (and for) the
Honorable the Executive Council did not warp
his judgment. To every man his conscience, and
if His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, and the
Venerable the Archdeacon —there was as yet no
Bishop to press the episcopal signet to the lump
of wax which was to sanctify and legalise an act
of officialised scoundrelisra—chose to shut their
eyes to dubious proceedings while opening their
mouths to receive the golden reward of complicity,
that was their look-out. He, the continued
assigned servant, would share neither the sin nor
the profit. When, some morning, he would open
the Gazette and find his name in the list of
“ Conditional Pardons,” he would go forth to the
world a sobered and chastened and honest man.
This was his dream and his ambition. And every
fresh instruction to do this and that shady thing
he regarded as a fresh trial of his moral power.
He did these things, but the force of his inward
protest grew with each repetition. Fleury con-
gratulated himself upon his clerk’s increasing
pliancy and bility, while the clerk himself felt
that at his core was an increasing strength. And
the latter, the duller of the two, was truer in his
judgment.
# * *
“ Harley,” said Fleury one day,
a ticklish thing to put through with the Surveys
and the Council—deucedly ticklish. I want your
best attention, and no mistake.”
“Yes, sir !”
“It’s a block of Cook’s River land, a full
hundred acres —a mile or so ’tother side the
Waterloo mills, an’ runnin’ to the river. Swampy
in parts, but easily drained—just the thing for
market-gardeners an’ fodder-growers—near town
—same sort of ground as brings thirty-quid a year
rent at Isleworth an’ Brentford, in the old
country. Now, I’ve a buyer for that at thirty-
three-ten an acre—a topper of a price by a tenner
over any land sold this twel’months. Are ye
followin’ me?”
“ Yes, sir !”
“Title’s a grant—grantee, ’manoipist—d’ye
wish ye were a ’mancipist, Teddy ?—never mind,
’ll come soon enough——” He liked to fire these
little shots, did Fleury, knowing in his heart the
while that if he could help it, he’d keep Harley
on till he grew grey waiting for the pardon that
would never come. But Harley, unflinching in
demeanour, though his heart quivered, only
replied with his respectful, “Yes, sir !”
“ Eh, I know you would. Well, that ’mancipist
can’t be found. “ He went a-whalin’, an has never
turned up,”
“That should be easy enough then, sir, to get
over,” said Harley, who had the clearest of recol-
lections of certain trifling incidents in the history
of colonial land-grabbing.
“ Not so easy as you’d think, Jim. If the cove
had left no one behind in possession, the thing
would be easy, but that’s just what the fellow did.
There’s a woman in possession who says she’s his
wife.”
“ That’s bad—for you, sir,” said Harley, falling
into his master’s humour.
“ Aye, damned bad. An’ wus’, she’s got her
papers—marriage lines —her man’s pardon—the
muster-master’s permission to marry when he was
on’y a ticket cove. I know that much.”
“ How did you find out, sir, may I ask ?”
“ Oh, easy ! Sent up Izzy Chipman, the cop,
to bounce her into showin’ ’em. Izzy said he’d
information as she was a loose ’un. She got
indignant then, an’ show’d her lines. Damn her !
if she ’adn’t ’em, I’d ’ave her out in ’arf-a-jiffy.”
“ How d’you mean then, sir, to get her off the
land ? I s’pose that’s th’ object ?”
“ Yes—that's the game ! I knew you’d see the
point, Jim. An’, look ’ere, the cove’s wots in
this with me is pretty ’igh up in the service, an’
you’ve on’y to do wot I say ” He stopped to
leisurely withdraw a cheroot from his pouch and
light it. But the while he did so, he was sending
swift, searching glances angularly at Harley’s
silent face. The clerk was breathless. The tone
more than the words implied—ah, so much !
“ An’ ” Fleury puffed; each expiration of
smoke was to Harley as the thrusting fork of an
adder’s tongue to a victim caged with the noxi-
ous thing.
“ And what, sir?” Harley could not bear the
strain.
“ You get your ” He paused again, with a
subtle ingenuity worthy of the devil-born, to
emit more coils of smoke.
“ My ticket, sir?”
“No !” Another puff. “Better ’n that!”
“A pardon, sir?” The knots were tightening
on Harley’s throat.
“ Ye-es!”
“ A conditional, sir ?”
“No 1” He flung the cheroot to the corner of
the room, and beat his closed fist on the desk.
“No. Absolute /”
Absolute 1 Harley swept the perspiration away
with his handkerchief. Absolute! Free! Togo
where he chose ! Heaven within his grasp !
“ I’ll do what you want me, sir,” he, stumbling
in his utterance, said at last.
And Fleury chuckled.
# # *
“That’s right!" the auctioneer said.
“You won’t get a chance like this again in a
hurry, Harley, I can tell you. You marry the
woman ”
“ W-what—sir ?”
“ You marry the woman —you’ve agreed to do
that, ain’t ye?”
“ I didn’t know as it was that, Mr. Fleury.”
“ Well, ye said ye’d do wot I wanted, didn’t ye?
An’ I want ye to marry the ”
“ But—but, sir—her husband may be alive.”
“ oh, it, we’ll take care of that. We can’t
kill him—but we’ve got the chap ready as saw him
die.” And Fleury laughed his best polished laugh.
“ An’ s’posing the woman won’t have me ? ”
“ Now, Harley ” Fleury turned and
threateningly faced his assigned clerk. “Do ye
mean to say as ye’ve been wi’ me for a couple o’
years, an’ are still so green as to let a trifle stand
in yer way. Ye’ve to marry ’er—an’ that’s all
about it, my man, or ye don’t get no pardon
through me. An’ wot’s more, I’ll stop your
chance for as much as a ticket. Ye’ll be a.lag for
life, an’ no mistake, if ye cross me ! ”
“I don’t wish to cross you, sir, but I don’t see
how I’m to marry tli’ woman against her will.”
“ Don’t ye ? Now, I do—an’ ye’ve jest to do as
I say, an’ things ’ll come out as easy as John
Palmer slapped the Guvnor’s face.* Listen, now !”
And then Mr. Fleury, privileged agent of the
Government and many highly-placed officials, un-
folded his ingenious plan.
The woman, to eke out her living, occasionally
let rooms to Sydney residents who wished to enjoy
“ the exhilariousness of Cook’s River air ” in pre-
ference to visiting Parramatta or Campbelltown.
Harley was to engage accommodation for a month
or two or so long as was necessary to secure the
ends of his employer. By employing the delicate
arts familiar to every man of the world he was to
invite the woman’s confidence, and that obtained,
and a friendly and sympathetic feeling established
between them, the concerted “news” would be
communicated to her of her husband’s death,
“I’ll have that cokumed up all right, Jim, an’
it’ll fluster her. Then all you’ve to do is to show
a friendly—a brotherly interest, ye know, in her,
an’ accordin’ as she takes to ye enough, or don’t
take to ye at all, ye’ll have to act. If she cares
for ye, she’ll marry ye as soon as ye like. If ye
don’t, ye’ve still to earn her confidence, an* then
it’s all the same. I know women, an’ I’ll bet a
hundred dollars to Garnham Blaxoell’s bill,+ she’ll
ask ye to see her papers for the property put
through the offices. She’s a baby in business, an’
she’ll do that, or I’m a Dutchman !”
“And, s’posing she won’t marry me, and I do
get the papers, that won’t help you, will it, sir ?”
“If she marries ye, all right. An’ if she don’t
marry ye, that’s all right, too. When we—that
is I, myself—give ye th’ papers back, ye’ll jest be
her’usband accordin’ to them. Now, d’ye see ?”
And Harley had to admit he perceived the logic
of the scheme. Obtain possession of the woman’s
“marriage-lines” and th© document which had
given the husband permission to marry, and
the rest was indeed easy. The register of the
marriage would have proved an obstacle to anyone
less potential in the “ departments ” than Fleury.
But for Fleury, the expenditure of a mere baga-
telle of energy sufficed to make the book-entry
correspond with a certificate which had been
forged or mutilated to serve his ends.
Solicitors of this present day sending for
evidence of early-day marriages performed by the
colonial chaplains should soon learn that, for the
gaps in the records the land speculators of the
Twenties and Thirties were almost wholly respon-
sible.
# # #
Whichever happened, the marriage or the
refusal to marry, Fleury, Harley’s consent won,
considered the land was virtually his client’s.
By the marriage, Harley, without recourse to a
criminal act, would secure the control of the land
and, of course, he would have signed a document
transferring the interest in it before the ceremony.
Without the marriage the same end would be
effected by the substitution of Harley’s name in
the two papers—say, by the hands of the gifted
Mr. Pounce, writer and forger—followed by the
* “John Palmer struck the Governor” —Oommissary-
General Palmer, though an undersized man, had a long
reach of arm. On one occasion he struck Governor King.
That incident, and his length of arm, passed into Early-
day Sydney proverbs.
f “ Garnham Blaxcell’s bill ” —a worthless bit of paper.
Blaxoell, one of the contractors for the “ Rum Hospital,”
and formerly Colonial Secretary, absconded to India,
leaving a large number of promissory notes i>n circulation.

A sweat as of fever oozed through his pores.
“I’ve sinned enough in my time. I’ll sin no
more!” . ~, , , ~

lie walked across the room, and seating himself at
his desk, took out a sheet of notepaper from the
rack, dipped his quill in the ink, and then,
with suspended pen, declared his ultimatum.
“This is your one chance for freedom ! Will
you take it? Give me the papers, an’ I’ll forgive
and forget wot’s just gone by ! Will ye take it ? ”
“ No !” said Convict Harley.

In the year ’54, Convict Harley died
insane at Port] Arthur. The attractive site,
“similar,” so ran the advertisement of a later
day, when it was thrown into the market, “ to the
admirable and fertile quality of land which, rich
and capable of producing almost anything, lets for
=£3o per acre annually merely to supply Covent
Garden, London,” was incorporated with other
blocks and formed the nucleus of a famous estate.
The grant to Henry Burne was superseded by
another in which Mr. Philip Eleury was the
agent for the person who became the grantee.
Some day, when we tell the story of the Black
and White Books, we shall describe Convict
Harley’s later career.
The Reprobate’s Reply.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Three droving men, some three weeks syne,
Sat drinking the Queensland rum ;
’Twas four a.m. when twa o’ them
Saw Jock M'Phee succumb.
Hech ! they were giddy songs he’d sung,
And the yarns which he’d spun were “ free ” !
For the liquor that nioht had loosed the tongue
O’ gudeman Jock M'Phee.
They tault the meenister what befell,
So he tuk braw Jock to task•
“Jock, gie me noo an answer true
To one question I wull ask.
“ An’ it happened the Laird had stricken yo,
A reprobate, graceless mon,
Whan ye war a bletherin’ yestere’en
D’ye ken whare ye wad hae gone ?”
“ Whare wad I hae gone?”—and Jockie wunk—
“ Dinna ye fash yersel* mair—■
For I wad ha’ bin too terrible drunk
To ha’ gone anywhere.”
THE BREAKER.
The Age now asserts that “ the system of
importing officers has, on the whole, proved a
failure.” A sentiment eloquently seconded by all
those parents whose daughters have not succeeded
in making the necessary “ impression.”
The Age discloses the fact that, for some
considerable time, the Nelson man-of-war has
been connected with Melbourne by telephone.
An agitation for gas and water is held over, pend-
ing an answer from the Department to a request
that city sites be placed at the disposal of the
fleet. The Imperial officers find it beastly incon-
venient getting home from the club.
What One Does in ’Em.
Dear Bulletin,— The story “ What he did with
it,” in your issue of the 29th October, was written
by a man who knows something. That unknown
(to me) writer is from this day my friend. In the
interest of those who may be afflicted with dipso,
mania or alcoholism, I have to state that the
ignorance, real or pretended, of judges, justices,
or others, is the cause of many an irreparable error.
Notably Judge Striker. I have heard him say :
“He must have been sober when lie forged this
cheque.” There is no must in it. Ido not defend
drunkenness, nor would I allow a murderer to
escape who, in a sober manner, slew his neighbour'
whilst he “had ’em.” But, as I told you once
before, I wrote, directed, and posted to you a
story for which you paid me and I have no recol-
lection of the facts. Still, the matter was readable
and payable, and I can swear to its emanation
from me.
All glory to the coming cheap, portable micro-
phonograph which will be used in police and civil
cases. Those who wish to destroy their identity
or swindle their employes will then have to speak
in assumed voices. In the “Moonstone,” the stealer
of the diamond has to be brought into his former
state of ebriety and surroundings in order to
cause the required somnambulism. Just in the
same way, in order to recall lost facts it would be
often advisable to make a man drunk. This and
snakebite are perhaps the only justifiable cases of
premeditated drunkenness ; in fact the pre-ordin-
ance of it ought not to be in every instance known
to the patient, victim, experirnentee, or whatever
you like to call him.
When the Drink Commission was sitting, I
urged on the Government and public the great
good that could be done by calling a few profes-
sional tipplers and beer-eaters as witnesses instead
of Bishop Barry, Dr. Mackellar, &c. I was the
more annoyed at the want of sympathy shown me,
as I hoped to be a summoned expert, especially
having just had a remarkable experience verifying
my hypotheses.
It was thusl had only nine pounds after
shearing, but was determined to see the Smoke.
I therefore sent that sum to Seymour P. 0., and
started to swag it towards my money. Luck
befriended me, and I worked a passage from
Balranald to Echuca in the Native Companion.
A few days carried me to my bank, and I arrived
in Melbourne safe, with about 30 shillings in my
pocket and seven pounds in my swag. I left the
latter at a boarding-house, and proceeded to invest
my loose cash in samples. This was at night.
Next morning I found myself in Spencer-street
without money or even a hat, and I had forgotten
where the lodging-house was. All I remembered
was that it had a red lamp.
In front of me a man was washing a buggy in a
shed belonging to a coach-factory.* I asked him for
for an old hat. He answered in Scotch. Result, a
hat, and loan of two shillings. Then I remem-
bered the “Moonstone.” How I was muddled
when I arrived by the late train. Six long beers
made me in statu quo ante and I proceeded to the
railway station. Coming out from the platform,
I walked straight to a house in Bourke-street with
a red lamp and a German landlady. There was
my swag in a corner untouched, and my joy was
like unto that of the seraphs over a repentant
lushington. We want a new Drunk Commission.
I am ready.

In consequence of the prevailing
HARD TIMES,
Dr SPEER has determined to REDUCE his PEES to
ovactlv ONE-HALF of those usually charged, and he
y trusts that this will prove itself
GOOD STEWS INDEED
to those thousands of poor but honest sufferers, who,
though willing to pay a small fee proportionate to their
means are quite unable to pay the enormous charges so
often made.
Pr SPEER wishes it to be distinctly understood that
his charge is INCLUSIVE, and that when once he takes a
curable case in hand he names a fee which includes all
advice, attendance and medicines until the patient is
completely cured. It therefore naturally becomes his
object to cure his patient as quickly as possible.
NERVOUSNESS.

and WEAKNESS, for his many years of practice with
these diseases enables him to remove all traces of them,
and to return the victims to full VIGOR and HEALTH.
N.B.—TWENTY SHILLINGS is sufficient to
send for remedies necessary for the cure of
NERVOUSNESS and WEAKNESS.

WEAKNESS consult Dr. SPEER.

SPEER.
ASTHMA consult Dr. SPEER.

Blood versus Bricks.
The dismal spectre of the ancient virtue of
Thrift rose again last weekin the New South
Wales Legislative Council, and the noise of
the same old mummies beating out the same
old straws of logic is once more heard in the
land. The visible cause of the trouble is
that feeble and inconsequent legislator,
attorney Trickett, M.L.A. ; and the shape
it has taken is that of an amendment on the
Assembly’s Bill for the abolition of plural
voting, the said amendment providing that
the plural vote shall not be abolished, but
that every man of Property shall have one
suffrage for his manhood and one more for
his greed and parsimony and his capacity
for getting ahead of his fellow-men. In
other words, the principle of One-man-one-
vote is to be altered to read that every man
shall have one vote and some of them shall
have more ; and that, all men are to be free
and equal, only some of them are to be more
equal than others. And in support of this
contention the old, old story of the beauties
of Thrift is to lie told all over again, that
grasping and niggardly “virtue” being the
only one which appeals to the sordid
souls of the apoplectic nominees. No one
has ventured to propose, so far, an extra
vote for honesty, courage, generosity, truth-
fulness, patriotism, genius, industry, know-
ledge, inventive capacity, for faith, hope,
charity, or any other good or noble quality.
The Upper House cares nothing at all for
any of these, but is solid as one enlarged
liver on the necessity of encouraging Pro-
perty. If it has even the courage of live per-
cent. of its opinions the Electoral Bill is
already as good as lost.
* * *
In speaking of the proposed extra vote for
Thrift, we have used, for convenience sake,
the same cant term which the National Ass,
and the Council, which is that animal’s
servant and representative, habitually em-
ploy. In reality, however, it is something
lower and meaner than even that poor, mean
quality which the nominees propose to
reward with a double share of political
power'. Thrift is a base and grovelling, yet
comparatively honest quality. It is tire art
of going in rags and broken boots itr order
to scrape farthings together, and stow away
shillings in a stocking hidden up a chimney.
It is the complete mystery of being dirty in
order to save the price of soap, of being
ignorant, unintelligent, and animal, to save
the cost of education, of living on coarse
food, of inhabiting a hovel, of working early
and late, and of sitting in the dark to save
candle-ends. It is the noble trait of the
Dutch peasant who harnesses his wife to the
plough, and of the Chinaman who sells his
partner irr life and starts business with the
proceeds—in short, it is the epitome of petty
meanness, and the whole duty of hide-bound
selfishness condensed into one word. But it
does not necessarily imply direct robbery or
actual fraud, and therefore, in a certain
negative sense, it may almost pass for a
virtue. Unhappily, however, Thrift is
seldom the road to wealth. The thrifty
individual generally ends by putting his
savings in some villainous institution at a
high percentage, and is plundered. All the
half-hundred insolvent banks of Melbourne
and Sydney lived on Thrift, and since their
general bankruptcy that good and noble
quality has mostly gone to the Benevolent
Asylum.
« # »
Therefore, as the Council has no reverence
for anything but financial success, it does
not propose, despite all its wasted eloquence,
to give anybody a vote for Thrift. What it
really does propose is to give a vote for
affluence. It will give the usurer one
suffrage because he is a man, and one more
because he has habitually sold the bed from
under the widow, and has invested the pro-
ceeds in houses or land. It will give the
bogus banker an extra suffrage because he
successfully embezzled the deposits, while
the depositor, whose vanished hoard pro-
bably represented a whole lifetime of
“thrift,” will Tget no extra suffrage at all.
If the usurer had been too tender-hearted
to enrich himself by ejecting old women into
the stony highways, or the banker had been
too honest to steal the deposits, neither
ivould get a property vote, therefore the one
is allotted a vote for his brutality, and the
other for his dishonesty. Political power is
to be, as heretofore, the reward of wealth,
whether that wealth is acquired by nigger-
driving, land-dummying, fraudulent insol-
vency, bogus banking, arson, adulteration,
illicit - distillation, usury, cattle - stealing,
mine-salting, running an opium-den of fan-
tan house, welshing, bookmaking, receiving
stolen property, prize-fighting, running dis-
honest “ totes,” or any other form of robbery
or brutality under the sun. But there is no
question of a vote for Thrift ; it is baldly
and undisguisedly a vote for money, no
matter how acquired or how r applied—one
vote for each of the eleven disciples, and
two for Iscariot, because he had sold his
Master to advantage and become a capitalist
thereby.
# # *
There is not, The Bulletin firmly
believes, more than one man in the Council
who will give an honest and willing support
to the central principle of the Electoral Bill
—not more than one, if there is one, who
does not hunger after the blessed privilege
of a vote for Property. But the Upper
House is an uncertain and feeble body, and
much gone in the knees, and if it realises
that the Assembly is in deadly earnest, it
will pass the measure all the same. If it
has doubts about the sincerity of the Lower
House it will probably patch and tinker the
Bill, and kill its vital principle by inserting
the proviso that the fat man shall have an
extra suffrage for his pile, no matter how
acquired, and for his corpulence ; and ivill
their return it to the people’s representatives
so late in the session that it will stand a fair
chance of being lost in the general confusion.
And if it is tolerably certain that the Assem-
bly is not in earnest, it will reject the
measure in toto , and announce its resolute
adherence to the grand old rule that the rich
man shall have twenty votes if he is rich
enough, and forty if he can get them. It is
difficult to form an accurate estimate of the
situation, but the balance of probabilities is
that the Lower House is not in earnest.
Also, the Ministry is only half in earnest,
and the Ministerial organ is not in earnest at
all, and the rest of the “respectable” press of
Sydney is almost undisguisedly hostile. The
one thing which forces the Assembly to pre-
serve an aspect of artificial enthusiasm is the
fact that there is a large majority of flesh
and blood in every electorate in the province
which favours electoral reform, and the least
sign of wavering means absolute ruin in a
political sense. But the conversion of at
least two-thirds of the legislators has been
much too sudden to be altogether real.
There is not, we firmly believe, one lawyer
in the House, one tquatter, merchant,
banker, landlord, or any other form or
variety of capitalist who, in his heart, does
not loathe the very sound of what the pre-
tendedly friendly capitalistic press sneeringly
calls “ the Democratic shibboleth,” and who
does not long to see the hated measure sunk
in the lowest depths of eternal oblivion.
Out of 141 legislators there are probably 100
who will rejoice with an exceeding great joy
if some circumstance over which they don t
appear to have any control gives them
another year’s breathing space. Time and
the inert weight of fat are powerful allies,
and every postponement means more hope
for the future.
# * *
The first definite sign of possible treachery
has come from the Australian Star the
special organ of the Dibbs Cabinet —which
asks the Council, in lukewarm tones, not to
precipitate a crisis which might possibly
compel a dissolution of the Assembly and all
the worry and turmoil of a new election.
The only plausible explanation of this
deliverance is that it is considered desirable
to gradually impress upon the public that a
dissolution is the only possible alternative,
should the Electoral Bill be rejected. In
reality such an expedient, under such cir-
cumstances, would be nothing else than an
act of the meanest treachery. It is not the
Assembly, but the Council, which stands in
need of dissolution ; the idea of promoting a
measure by dissolving the House which gives
a unanimous vote in its favour, while the
House which is almost unanimously hostile
remains intact, is merely shooting one’s
allies to overawe the enemy. There is no
moral effect to be gained ; at last election the
province returned an Assembly which was
pledged as one man to the abolition of plural
voting, and it cannot by any possibility do
more : there is nothing more unanimous
than absolute unanimity. The only possible
result to be produced by a general election
is that the new organisations of Capital might
have a chance to make themselves felt; that
the magnates of the National Assmight succeed
in once more forming a Conservative party
in the Lower House ; and that there would
consequently be some colour of plausibility
in the assertion that the Democratic move-
ment was a mere transitory agitation. Then
the House of Living Death, which ventures
now to oppose itself to the votes of all the
people’s representatives, would gain new
strength, and its fatty heart would rise to
the occasion. There is nothing—absolutely
nothing—to be gained for the cause which
the Assembly and the Dibbs Government
and the Dibbs Government’s organ are under-
stood to have at heart by a dissolution, and
there is everything to be lost. The odds
in the political gamble are exactly 141 to
nothing, and there is no semblance of profit
in laying such odds as these for mere amuse-
ment.
# * *
The Ministry—if it is really sincere— made
its first great mistake when it omitted to
designate the measure as being distinctly a
Bill for the Abolition of Plural Voting, by
which device it would have made it impos-
sible to tack on any proviso in favour of a
vote for alleged Thrift. It will make its last
mistake—the last it will ever have a chance
to make—if it dissolves the House which
supports its programme in order to get level
with the House which does not. If the
Council takes its courage in both hands and
rejects the Electoral Bill, there are only two
honest and downright courses available.
The one is to tack the electoral scheme on
to the Appropriation Bill, and compel the
nominees either to accept it as it stands
or take the responsibility of stopping the
business of the country, leaving the Civil
Service unpaid, the public works paralysed,
and the public creditors unsatisfied. The
other is to swamp the Council with enough
Democrats to carry the measure, and then to
settle the vexed problem in one act by the
avoirdupois weight of the newly-created
majority. There are absolutely no other
alternatives, and if the Ministry adopts
neither of these, then there is no vestige of
sincerity in G. Republican Dibbs and his
colleagues, and their official days shall be
short in the land, and it will be time for
someone else to try his hand at the great
work of rnisgovernment in their stead.
A Slander Rebutted.
It is really unfair to tlie devoted adherents of
Royalty that the subject of t he betrothal of the
Princess May of Teck to Prince George of
Wales should be still dealt with by hints and
unofficial intimations. Loyalists are kept in a
miserable condition of uncertainty with respect
to the attitude which it may be proper for them
to assume. They are, up to the time at
which we write, entirely at a loss whether
to denounce the rumour as a base caLunny
devised by wicked, unscrupulous radicals and
republicans, always eager to represent royalty
in an odious light, or whether to acclaim the
alleged betrothal as a charming instance of
the domestic virtues of the Queen and the
devoted attachment of the Princess to—well,
to the Royal Family. Any doubt respecting a
matte; of so much importance is productive of
the most serious embarrassment. But, really,
there ought to he no place for doubt in a truly
loyal heart. The current reports which are
afloat to the effect that the Princess May will
marry Prince CleorGe are merely trials of the
faith of true believers in Monarchy. No person
who has a genuine belief in the Monarchical
system and in the impeccableness by the grace
of Cod of the Sovereign, our beloved Queen,
that exemplar of all the domestic virtues,
that model to all wives and mothers,
can possibly hesitate to i;epol a rumour so
charged with scandalous depreciation of every-
thing that is worthy of allegiance and respect.
Those who hesitate or doubt are the Thomases
among loyalists, and ought to be ashamed of
themselves. There are a few facts, admitted
by every right-thinking person to be incontro-
vertible, which, when considered, show that the
alleged arrangement is impossible, and cannot
ever have been so much as thought of by any
but those scurrilous persons who invent slanders
for the base and wicked purpose of besmirching
the pui’e and elevated characters of Her
Majesty the Queen, the Prince of Wales, and
all the Royal Family —as the Prayer-book
phrases it -and also of the Batten bergs, the
Teoks, and other serene personages enholied by
matrimonial connection with that sacred and
saintly race.
# * *
It is admitted, for example, that although
there may possibly, and in a limited sense, have
been sovereigns and their sons and daughters of
the House of Hanover whose marital relations
have unhappily afforded some opportunity for
uninformed persons with ill-regulated minds to
make injurious and disreputable reflections, and
whose general morality and principles have not
shone with that clear, brilliant, and steady
flame which gratifies the loyal eye, such
deficiencies have only been attributable-
even by the most scurrilous —to personages
after they have been dead. It is, or should
be, sufficient to point out that those ghouls who
have, as it were, torn out of the grave the
reputations of buried princes, have no real, sub-
stantial endorsement from witnesses who lived
contemporaneously with the aspersed person-
ages. It would be easy to produce an over-
whelming host of testimony of the persons
highest in rank and consideration, to show that
while living these slandered persons were held
in veneration and esteem. There has not been
one of these posthumously depreciated princes
who failed to attract the reverential deference,
and to enjoy, when so disposed, the personal
intimacy of the most estimable contemporaries.
It should suffice to silence the malice ot censors,
simply to remember that in no single instance
did an archbishop or a bishop ever refuse to
associate with one of them, much less feel called
upon to reprimand them for failure to observe
those decencies and moralities so essential
towards setting an example to the nation. It
may be further adduced that no respectable
journalist ever assailed them, and that, in fact,
whenever a writer did attempt to slander their
pure and sensitive character, he was almost
certain to be a mere gaol-bird—immediately
afterward. Moreover, a close investigation of
the records of the time will show that these
very princes, however sadly maligned by a
subsequent generation, were esteemed for their
splendid qualities in every part of the country.
In their occasional progresses through the
realm, the mayors of cities, and all that was
respectable by position in the most widely
separated localities, concurred in hastening to
testify, by public addresses, to the universal
appreciation of the remarkable virtues of these
personages.
* * «
But even if there were a semblance, however
fallacious, of truth in the disgraceful aspersions
which have been thrown on the ancestors of
the present Royal family, it is certain that
nothing of the kind attaches to those of the
present day. It would be nothing short of
indecency to question their possession of all the
virtues which embellish humanity and con-
stitute the highest elevation of intellect, feel-
ing, and morality. If there be one claim
which, more than another, her present gracious
Majesty, Queen Victoria, has upon the devo-
tion of her subjects, it lies in the pure and
noble example which she has set and furnished
in all matters connected with the sanctity of
the marriage state and the maintenance of the
homely domestic feelings. It would, therefore,
be most disloyal and scandalous to attach credit
for one moment to so disparaging a supposition
as that she would countenance so indecent a
transaction as a pretended transference of
affection by a love-lorn young woman, from one
brother to another, If it were credible that a
being so tender, so refined, so devoted as the
Princess May, were capable of conceiving within
a year a marital affection for Prince (leorge
—the terrible possibility obtrudes itself that
even had her first love lived and wedded her,
the same change might have affected the move-
ments of her heart, and the wife of the Duke of
Clarence would have become enamoured of her
husband’s brother, the Duke of York. It is
wrong, it is almost criminal, to entertain the
thought that the current report can have any
origin save in the perverted imagination of the
libeller-s of royalty. It is but a short year since
the loyal hearts of the nation vibrated in pain-
ful response to the officially guaranteed sobs < f
the heart-broken princess, as clinging to the
body of the royal youth who had won her
virgin affection, she cried (as per cablegram),
“ Oh, Eddie, Eddie, come back to me !” It is
cruelly grotesque to imagine that if the Prince
were now to respond to that piteous pleading
he would find the maiden pouring out the
wealth of her young affections upon his brother.
# * *
It has been, we are aware, common enough in
other Royal and Imperial families, for marriages
to be conducted merely as incidents connected
with diplomatic exigencies, and for a princess
to be flung into a negotiation with the same
disregard of her feelings, of the inclinations of
her destined spouse, and of the alleged sanctity
of marriage, as though she were a province, or
a city. It was thus, for example, that the Arch-
duchess Maria-Louisa of Austria was flung to
Napoleon Bonaparte, as among some bar-
barous races, maidens are thrown to savage
beasts, to appease or divert their ferocity.
But every Briton knows that nothing of the kind


lias been permitted by the present occupant of
the Throne. They know that the late gifted
Duke of Clarence returned the life-long love of
the Princess May with a touching and even poetic
devotion. They know, too, that when the Prince
of Wales placed his youthful daughter in the
arms of his venerable comrade, the Duke of
Fife, it was merely in compliance with the
earnest wishes of her young heart, which
yearned for a spouse over whose declining
hairs she might watch with a wife’s, and almost
daughter’s, affection. We know, from Her
Majesty’s own published journal, that the
Princess Louise felt the first awakenings of
love when Lobne was presented to her, and
that silly stories about constraint and secret
natural girlish inclination for the young clergy-
man must be a lie—because., if it weren’t, the
Queen’s own narrative would be a fraudulent
imposition upon the credulity of her readers.
# *
These facts being known, there can be no
room for doubt about the falsity of the reported
transference of the intense and disinterested
affection of the Princess May from the late to
the present Heir-presumptive to the Crown.
Were it otherwise, what a lurid reflex light
would be cast back upon all precedent matri-
monial affairs in the family ! English parents
■do not sell their daughters for a fortune —at
ileast hardly ever. And the reason why business
-is thus banished from affairs of the heart and
True Love conquers, is because of the beautiful
(example set by our own noble Queen with re-
spect to her own family. (She may not be super-
'latively clever, she may not have the masculine
iforce of an Elizabeth, but she reigns in the
(hearts of her people by virtue of her constant
and consistent practice and maintenance of
ithose homely domestic virtues so seldom res-
pected by the occupant of a throne.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Pulpit in the Press.
Brisbane Telegraph, a modern, moral evening
(newspaper, managed and edited by double-
(parson power—the Lord has “ called ” the two
saints in question from the pulpit to the press —
published the other day, as a protest, probably,
-against Sam. Grieeith’s “ Indecent Advertise-
anent Act, a “ rorty ” long-primer article of If
rcolumns on “ Secrets of the Ballet : Interview
with a Premiere Danseuse.” Not only so, but
.-they first of all stole it, unacknowledged—
iprobably from some other parson —and never
iowned up. How Bald-headed Morality doth
Hick its salacious chops ! The danseuse tells
.how .the ballet-nymph “ slices ” —that is, pads
—her figure, till perfect proportions are ob-
tained;? how she “makes” a complexion,
[fashions a rosebud mouth with a veritable
Cupid’s bow, giving due dullness to the upper
flip ; how “ highly-coloured .nostrils ” are made
tto “ give a spirited look,to ithe face how the
<eyes are made “limpid,” and to assume “a
rsomewhat amorous expression;” how “thin
mecks ” are concealed, &c,, &c. But —
'.Long, bony arms—ugh ! They are a nightmare. Thin
[legs are nothing in comparison. They can be sliced to
perfection. Thin arms, God alone, can rectify.
*“Go®!!” The saints will probably make this a
nsaitber ifor special prayer. The danseuse
explains ithe “toe-dance,” and how shoes'do
not need to be stiffened in order to enable it to
be “ toed/” Then—
“ Are my feet callous and misshapen? Ah! you are
mocking me,” In a twinkling,the scissors had clipped off
the foot of her stocking, presenting to view a ravishing
font, as soft and white as a babe’s. . . . “To convince

A Suspicious-Looking Article.
.[ Brassey, the widowed cruiser who recently
(married again, lias published an article in
favour of an Imperial Council of Defence,
whereat representatives of the kawlinies, aftpr
being carefully knighted, iriay assist represen-
tatives of Great Britain to devise means for
maintaining the Empire intact. Brassey has
just sufficient brains, it seems, to despair of
establishing a zollverein between the dear old
mother country and her Protectionist “depen-
dencies.” But as regards defence. —well, the
interests of all parts of the h’Empire are abso-
lutely identical, therefore a bond of union can be
fixed up right away, prattles Brassey. A lucid
statement concerning the mechanism of this
desirable Council of Defence —a simple idea of
the end to be accomplished and the benefits it
will create—is not expected from fervid
“ loyalists ”of the Brassey type. He may be
■dreaming of nothing more than a nauseous
scheme for strengthening military spirit (which
is considerably underproof just now) in “Her
Majesty’s outlying possessions.” Or he may
have the Tory impudence to conceive the possi-
bility of an Imperial Defence Fund into which
the kawlinies can pay money for the Queen’s
fat cousin, George of Gampridge, to invest in
experimental uniforms and new buttons for the
standing army. But no matter what Brassey
really means by his article, he has said
enough to confirm the opinion that lie is
not worth listening to. Nothing is more
certain than the fact that some portions
of the Empire in question care not a straw
about the “ safety ” (as Jingoes call it) of
other portions. Canada may annex herself to
America next week, and Australia will wish
that cold-and-hot country good luck in the
transaction. British South Africa, or any
other slice of the Bark Continent, can haul
down the Union Jack and become double Dutch
for all that we are interested in the matter.
Fifty islands, scattered all over the globe,
would worry us not a bit if they ceased to sing
“God Save the Queen” of their own accord,
or were ordered to change their tune by a ruth-
less “foreigner.” Newfoundland might go
over to the French without making us turn a
hair, and the destiny of St. Lucia or Mauritius
concerns us not. The niggers would continue
to make sugar with their feet under any cir-
cumstances, and we could go on buying it from
somebody at the same old price, whatever
happened. The preservation of India to
England is a highly important financial
matter for the last - named party ; but
its indirect advantages to Australia
are not worth mentioning. Finally we
come to the Maternal Relative herself —
Britannia, the Pride of the Ocean, &c.—and
even her state of defence causes us little
anxiety. For the past 800 years nobody has
landed at Hastings to seize the country, and if
anyone were to march on London just now the
“submerged tenth” would “go” for the
enemy’s commissariat department until the in-
vasion resembled friend Jonah who was eaten up
by the whale. The indifference of Australia to
other parts of the h’Empire is generally re-
ciprocated. Great Britain will support the
southern continent as a commercial specula-
tion, just as long as it is a paying speculation —
but no longer. If necessary Hingland will fight
to preserve a profitable market for her goods
and cash. The influential wind-bags of this
rogue-ridden region are persuaded that without
Hingland we should be lost—inasmuch as they,
the town vultures feasting on a rotten condition
of things brought about by too much borrowed
money, would be lost. But already Australia is
nearly as independent of the Crown which adopted
our country for a convict settlement as America
was when (George Washington made her free.
Long before the “Home” Government has
ceased to love this portion of the Empire from
mercenary motives there will be no further fear
on the score of Our Defences. Nay, more,
there is already no chance of Australia being
captured by a few men-of-war. We need no
representation at any council of defence or
attack. With the despatch of the Soudan
Contingent our mania for helping our mother-
in-law began and ended. Any proposal to drag
Australia into the mire of Imperial policy, and
charge her rent for a small annual participation
in Hingland’s Glory, is to be strongly depre-
cated. The h’Empire as a whole is a purely
British affair, and sufficent for each bit is the
evil thereof.

A Girl for Sale.
The baby-for-sale industry is under a cloud
just now in Sydney, but the girl-for-sale busi-
ness is starting to boom. Somebody who
apparently wants to dispose of a young female
in a bankrupt estate, or to trade her off to
close accounts, advertises in Sydney E. News :
"lA/'ANTED, Lady to Adopt useful Girl, 10; £3 re-
, V quired. 8., St., .
In other words, the girl in question is openly
advertised for sale, at the low price of 60s. She
is useful,” which evidently means that the
purchaser can get the value of his or her money
put of her, either by using her as k hard-driven
domestic servant without Avages, or by some
' other process. The ad‘. is' addressed to ladies,
either because the advertiser will only do busi-
ness with'a lady, or else because, though she is
willing to ‘ trade off the victim to anybody, a
notice “to Chinamen and others,” would be
filtogpther too glaring. What kind of lady is
likely ,tp invest in a girl bf 10 under such cir-
cumstances is a subject that is too unplea-
sant to go into details about. Probably the
lady who bought a girl for 60s. might not bo
averse to selling her again at a profit, and what
kind of person she might sell her to is a
matter for particularly disgusting conjecture.
In any case the Dibbs Government would do
well to look into that advertisement and' others
like it, and consider if it can’t do anything to the
person who sells girls, and the person who buys
them, and the Evening Babymarket which acts
as agent and go-between in this variety of trade
in human flesh. Also, it might find out whether
the girl-selling business is an old-established
industry, and whether they are sold in times of
drought by mothers who drink their children,
or whether they are bred expressly for sale
purposes. When the trade begins to slop over
into the evening papers it seems to suggest that
it is a tolerably extensive industry, and has
been conducted so long with impunity that the
girl-dealer of the period is growing reckless as
to consequences. !
Jay Gould.
Jay Gould,, cojnmonly reputed to be the second
or third richest man on earth, died the other
day. He was worth many 'millions—ho w many
is * still mere conjecture—and as a shining
example of the grand virtue of Thrift he stands
almost unrivalled. There is a legend that,
many years ago, Gould worked honestly for
his livelihood at agriculture or some equally
humble and unprofitable employment; and this
was the only period in his life when he was of
the slightest value to humanity. For the rest
of his career he was a malignant and much-
respected cancer eating away the vitals of the
community. He made no money out of toil,
and speedily abandoned it. Then he became an
oily peddler in patent “ notions,” and gathered
together a few dollars by persuading house-
wives to speculate in curious mouse-traps and
other lumber. His first genuine “ rise,” how-
ever, was made by bold and naked forgery.
Without the aid of capital, for they had little,
and without Thrift, for they had none, but
merely by lying and superhuman gall, he and
his partner, tin 1 painted, raddled and bedia-
monded Fis;;—.m individual who looked like
the original seed Abrahams of the earth
secured control of the directorate of the Erie
Railroad, a poor, bankrupt, shoddy-built con-
cern which was barely worth owning. But in
the course of a stock-exchange gamble, the
firm got a chance to sell to Vanderbilt several
million dollars’ worth of bogus shares, and then
fled from justice with the proceeds. Later on
they succeeded in compounding this big felony,
and, returning to their old haunts, they started
business on a huge scale with the proceeds of
the robbery. A little later on, Fisk, who had
some semblance of human sympathy about him
(he kept a harem), was shot in the abdomen by
one Stokes, by reason of a difference of opinion
concerning a female, and, after that, Gould
went his way alone. His business consisted in
freezing out small shareholders, in watering
stock, and issuing false balance-sheets, and
selling valueless shares, and making up fraudu-
lent accounts —also in company-wrecking and
finance generally. He did no honest work in
all his soul-blasting career of godless selfishness,
fraud, forgery and inhumanity. He made not
one blade of grass to grow, and created
not one green spot in all the earth to
make mankind the better for his existence.
He produced nothing; he did nothing that
would not have been a thousand times better
left undone ; he created no wealth, but merely
appropriated the wealth of others ; he had not
even the much-advertised virtue of Thrift, for
while he was thrifty he remained poor, and it
was only when he started on a frantic career of
gorgeousness that he grew rich. He made, pro-
bably, more beggars and more suicides than any
other private individual of his time ; his history
is written in the gaol, the lunatic asylum, the
morgue, the cemetery, the hospitals for incur-
ables, and every other place of horror where the
ruined victims of a soulless gambler could
possibly be found. And finally he died
and went to the place—wherever it may
be —that the sons and daughters of the
horse-leech go, and, so far as the world
is aware, not one human being in all the
numberless millions of the world’s inhabitants
would have him back again at any price.
During the thirty years or so of his greatness
he was a living proof of the beneficent in-
fluences of Capitalism, and of such as he the
gods of the National Ass are constructed.

More Land-Grant Railways.
A week or two ago the Victorian Legislature
began to show the first symptomsof the land-grant
railway madness, and as the bank mania and
the land mania and the gold mania are all in a
cold and frozen state at present, and as Vic-
toria must have a mania of some kind on hand,
the time is evidently favourable for a boom of
this description. Campbell, M. L.A., brought
the matter before the Assembly, and, in the
hideous language of Speaker Bent, he put it
nicely, but the substance of his speech, when
it isn’t put nicely, is very much as follows :
(1) That Victoria can borrow no more British
money at present, and is too slavish in her
reverence for J. Bull to attempt borrowing in
any other county, and has become so utterly
saturated with the idea that no public works
can be built without Bull’s assistance,
that the idea of constructing them out of
revenue, or paying for them by issuing Govern-
ment bonds to the contractor, or by the issue
of notes of a State Bank, or by floating a local
loan, hasn’t even dawned on anybody; (2)
That more railways must be constructed, not
that the people really want them, for there
isn’t nearly enough population to supply a pay-
able traffic on the lines already existing, but
partly because a few “big” men are holding
most of the country for a rise, so that unless
the mallee lands and the Gippsland mountains
are opened up, there is no place for the small
farmer to go to ; and partly because it is neces-
sary ito keep up the expiring tail-end of the
land-boom at any cost; and partly because the
Davtes-Best-Munro type of financiers will
shortly have lto> take refuge in the Benevolent
Asylum unless something is invented whereby
a representative citizen can make money with-
out working. Therefore, Mr. Campbell sub-
mitted that it was advisable to start the land-
grant system in Gippsland ,a,nd about the Mallee
regions, and the House, thpugh it didn’t abso-
lutely commit itself on the spot,; looked favour-
ably on the idea. The odds arc i; fhat the land-
grant swindle will start sooner or later. The Vic-
torians, under the horrid incubusnf Davies and
Munro and the suave and gentle BENT.and (dicir
kind, have evidently lost the art of industry,
and when one boom bursts their only desire is
to fix up another at any cost., ~'fhe idea
settling down, as the Maorilanders did when
the Vogel bubble blew up, to of solid
toil, with small profits, and falling repts,. and
no fresh loans, and no booms, and a skin-flint
system of bitter retrenchment, is not in their
line. They are always expecting,to find seme
easy, downhill road to affluence, ,and the 1
“opening-up” of the immense mineral riches*
of Gippsland and the agricultural wealth of the
mallee land is the latest, .nostrum- Nobody
makes the slightest allusion, fo the fact that,
when these riches are opened up,” the land-'
grant syndicate will have .them—that whereas
the people now prospectively ,own them, when
the railway is made they won’t own them at all—
and that when a nation wants access to its own
riches, and has to give away the riches to get
the access, and then has to pay for the access in
addition, the situation is just about as profit-
able as that of the man who makes a living by
committing suicide. The Victorian people
have the land, and want railways to get to it,
therefore it is proposed to give away the land
in order that Someone else will have the rail-
ways. This is "all ihsanity and vexation of
spirit. If the country is resolved on keeping
its public works system going there are various
ways of doing it. It may fix up a cast-iron
betterment law, so as to reduce the cost of con -
struction to a minimum, and then to supply
that cost it might pile on a ponderous land-
tax and set aside the proceeds for rail-
way works only, or it might issue bonds to
the contractors in payment, or settle the bill in
Government bank-notes and redeem them at a
certain fixed rate annually, or float a local loan,
or else borrow the money in America or France
or anywhere, at any rate of interest up to 8 per
cent, if it can’t be got for less. And even this
last insane device would be cheaper in the end
than the great land-grant fraud. There never
was a land-grant railway yet which didn’t cost
the country 20 per cent, per annum at the lowest
estimate.
A Last Word About Clara Parker.
Like many other notorious scandals that have
disgusted Victoria since Shiels became king of
the Crown Law department, the Joseph
CLARKE-citm-CLARA Parker case is being care-
fully hushed up. Once more Shiels has shut
his weak eyes to the truth, and the outraged
Law is ignoring somebody’s guilt with steady
perseverance. An Attorney-General with an
inch of backbone and a decent sense of duty
would come as a revelation to the land of
privileged misdemeanour just, now—but no
matter. God helps only the people who help
themselves, and if the Victorian people are
satisfied to lie prone in the dust of contempt,
with the fat man sitting heavily upon their
body politic, it is a waste of time to cry “ God
help them ! ” The case of millionaire Joseph
Clarke and Mrs. Clara Parker is a remark-
able instance of Money’s license to play the fool
with the machinery of the Law— i.e. , to set
it moving without justification and stop
it suddenly in the same casual way.
Joseph Clarke swore an information of
forgery against his lady friend, whereupon the
Crown locked her up. Mysterious men came
in a mysterious manner and spirited Mrs.
Parker away from the care of tire Crown, and
when Joseph Clarke was called upon to make
good his allegation of forgery, tire fair alleged
criminal was nowhere to Jbe found. In due
course she returned to Melbourne, bringing
with her an extraordinary story of how she had
been dragged from the arms of justice at vast
expense, and, having joyously surrendered her
liberty to Jdxe almighty Crown, insisted upon
being tried for forgery. She was therefore
brought to trial —and acquitted. The jury
found in effect that the rickety millionaire
had—possibly without knowing what he was
doing—sworn incorrectly as to the origin of a
certain signature upon a certain bill for £SOOO.
The Crown was now left with a choice between
tw r o suppositions. Either Joseph Clarke was
a malignant liar trying to crush an inconvenient
woman at the country’s expense, or a befuddled
creature wdio swore at random and treated the
law with hiccupy contempt. The latter and
more charitable supposition was supported by all
the common-sense argument that could obtain a
foothold upon this slippery case. Somebody’s
money had been poured out like water to pro-
cure the disappearance of Mrs. Parker from
the scene of legal action, and of the few people
interested in the woman’s fate, pray how
many were interested in supplying, and
able to supply, the needful ? The question
as to what the Crown would elect to do under
the circumstances was soon settled. It did
nothing at all. Mrs. Parker had to be—-there
was no avoiding this piece of humbug—formally
sent back to prison on a charge of absconding
from her bail, and after a miserable pretence of
considering the matter, the Crown decided not
to proceed with this charge. It wasn’t that
the Crown had any more consideration for Mrs.
Parker now than it had when she was first
bundled into prison at the bidding of her dodder-
ing old pal. The prosecution of Mrs. Parker on
the “absconding” ticket would simply mean a
legal exposure of the circumstances that led
to her disappearance, and for the sake of
vested interests, the Crown went “cronk,”
as usual. Ere public recollection of this cause
celehre fades away, The Bulletin will endea-
vour to show how advisable it was to refrain
from taking serious action to discover the truth,
and what a monstrous thing the prosecution of
Mrs. Parker really was. On the strength of
Joseph Clarke’s statement that the writing of
his name on a certain bill wasn’t like his signa-
ture, Mrs. Parker was brought very near to a
conviction for forgery. Now, it is a matter of
notoriety in Melbourne that Joseph Clarke’s
signature is so frequently unlike his signature
that the pay-clerks at the Colonial Bank have
more than once refused to cash his cheques to
bearer over the counter, even when a certain
relative had initialled them. The signature of
Joe and the initials of that relative were, in
each case, so utterly unlike the writing of their
less shaky moments, that the bank couldn’t
recognise the hands. Formerly there was a
mutual arrangement between Clarke and his
relative to initial one another’s cheques, in
order that the Colonial Bank might have
a double chance to swear by them, but the
system broke down badly as a rule. Neither of
the pair could imitate his “own signature”
or initials. Men presenting one of Joe Clarke’s
cheques, and being refused cash payments, are
in the habit of passing it through a bank
account (their own or anybody else’s), and on
this supposed guarantee of genuineness the
cheque seems to be met in the ordinary way.
Joseph Clarke’s signature, then, is a wild,
uncertain thing, which the most solemn
Rechabite cannot always identify, and when he
stated that the name on Mrs. Parker’s bill
didn’t seem to have been written by himself, he
was practically testifying to its genuineness.
Yet the miserable, trembling fingers of this
erratic sheep-owner can be put up to his red
nose in contempt of the Victorian Crowm Law
department.
A humorist isn’t always a good humorist.
The Syrians of Redfern, Sydney, have
imported a priest from Jerusalem and an inter-
preter from Beyrout. The former’s English is
confined to the familiar inquiry, “ How are ye?”
so that he will much need the interpreter. The
latter is an accomplished English scholar eduqated
at the Syrian Protestant College, Beyrout,
where two-thirds of the professors are American
and the rest Syrians.
Dear Bulletin, — I am not aware of the
“Sydney case ” to which you allude in answering
“Crazy Quito’s” criticism of my story, “The
Paying Out of Constable Crake.” I may say,
however, that I was under the same impression as
your correspondent for years, and that it was the
very necessity of verifying this particular one of
the points disclosed in the official papers relating
to the “ Grants ” which prevented the inclusion of
their story in the first series of “Tales of the
System.” published by you in 1800.— Price

840 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Dec. 7,1892,
My Dear Moorabinda,—
Somebody committed a robust piece of irony, done in
victuals, on the departure of an inhospitable Australian
Governor and his wife for the land whence they
came. He sent a hamper to the train for the vice-regal
refreshment en route, but instead of pdte de foie gras and
fizz the basket yielded up a few mustardless corned-beef
sandwiches, some cucumber (!) sandwiches, and six bottles
of lemonade ! And as their Excellencies closed their
eyes and munched they must have thought themselves
back again at their own buffet.
The current story re the jilted damsel of Newcastle
(N.S.W.) and the fickle sea-dog who promised to marry
her and didn’t, has all the elements of a romance, in-
cluding the stupidity. Briefly, there was a breach-of-
promise case, damages set at £3OO, and the strategic
captain, after vainly offering £2OO, settled the matter by
promising to marry the girl. But when the bridal morn
arrived there was a blank sheet of water where the
captain’s bark had rocked, and after agonised enquiriesit
transpired that the Deceiver had loaded up by double
shifts and sailed away to sea “ determined never to set
foot in Newcastle again !”
Both these people acted most absurdly. She ought to
have insisted on her damages and not let him go until
she got ’em. He ought to have married her (as she in-
sisted on it), paid her £5O or so for maintenance, and
gone away with a clear conscience to his other
wives in other ports. Instead of which she has got
neither man nor money, and he has one harbour to avoid
like the plague. There are always two morals to a breach
of promise case. The feminine one is—“ Make him pay.”
The masculine moral is Marry her.” And more espe-
cially so if you happen to be a sailor.
A German Pair started in Sydney Exhibition Building
last week, and save that the crowded stalls were Teutoni-
cally named, there were no particularly obtrusive German
points about the affair—no sauer-kraut or Frankfurt
sausages, or Fausts or Marguerites, or delikatassen hand-
lungs. The presiding buttonholers were gotten up in
clever fancy rig, but the stalls were mostly laden with the
same ogling doll and bouncing pin-cushion, for which
there seems to be a perpetual public want. A flower-stall
and the inevitable tea-and-bun buffet looked very effective
and pretty Mrs. Sahl’s art-stall made the superfluous
seem very necessary. But the most saleable thing I saw
was a "cure for wrinkles.” Half the people there ought
to have been absolutely mobbing it.
Mayoress Manning (still very nervous in public) opened
the Fair in English instead of the traditional Germain
but, after all, in so big a building all languages are pretty
well alike. There was the usual two-and sixpenny
attendance on the first day, and Admiral and the Misses
Bowden-Smith turned up to be stared at. The eldest
Miss Smith (you must never confound her with me,
remember !) wore an artistic, straight-up-and-down frock
of cinnamon-colour, trimmed with bands of brown satin
ribbon ; wide brown hat topped off with untanned
ostrich-feathers—the large committee bouquet of pale-
pink roses being seemingly built for the toilet. Our new
Admiral seems a homely and cheerful son of Neptune ; he
wears a short grizzled beard and moustache, and walks
with a pronounced quarter-deck roll. I like a potentate
who is not too dignified to stand and watch the v illainies
of Punch and Judy. A Sydney society belle cut rather a
mixed-up figure in a blue serge skirt, a black cloth
weather-jacket (it was a rainy day), and an airy black
gauze hat topped off with three big roses! To mingle
•serge and artificial flowers seems peculiarly Australian
taste.
Apropos, “ Madame de la Cour ” is now, I am told by a
London friend, head bodice-fitter (at £6OO a year) at
Poultz’s, London’s most trottie coutouriire. Madame
was once employed by a very swell Melbourne firm, but
Toorak didn’t appreciate her mouldings, and so she
left. Of course, between then and now there may have
been time to learn many things in the art of talking with
a mouth-full of pins, which, I think, is at least one of the
cleverest things dressmakers do.
After a very long run, the plain skirt and all its
mysterious modifications have to go upon the shelf and
rest for the seven years that are supposed to elapse before
an old fashion becomes new again. The latest gown is
nine yards wide round the feet, and trimmed with bands
of fur or braid several inches apart. Fur is very modish
just now even on ball-dresses, which are about the best
things to trim with it when you come to look at it. A
thick fur edging round a low-cut corsage ought to b
as good as a chest-protector to a fragile belle.
And so Princess May of Teck is to marry Prince George
of Wales—the jolly boy who had far more rope in Aus-
tralia than the closely-guarded and solemn “ Eddie.”
George, of course, is now King in prospective without
having suffered any of the espionage that made the late
Duke’s brief career as free and unfettered as that of a
Cup favourite the week before the race. Most women
probably consider her a lucky girl to bag two princes, but
(altogether apart from the question of common decency,
which would prevent any girl from marrying her dead
lover’s brother almost within a year) there doesn’t seem
much reason for anybody to jump for joy at the prospect
of marrying into the House of Hanover. The untram-
melled Duke of York is far too jolly to make a good
husband, and the future George the Fifth gives promise
of being the sort of potentate whose wife is always making
back to her ma. Someone remarked to me, the other
day, that the sweet Princess May is after the crown—no
matter whose head is in it.
What ought to be an interesting show takes place at
the Athenasum Hall, Waverley, on 14th inst., when a trial
of theatrical yearlings is to take place. Titheradge, (jun.)
Anson, (jun.) and young Emery, are to take part in a
performance of “Caste,” with Titheradge as Captain
Hawtrey, and young Anson in his dad’s pet part of
Ecoles, and Emery as D’Alroy. Amateur ladies assist the
young stagers, and it will be interesting to see how big
their daddies’ boots are for them.
The Xmas Fete (in aid of Sydney City Mission) opened
in premises on “The Block” the other Wednesday by
Mayoress Manning, went rather close to being a failure—
perhaps the deep anathemas of neighbouring shopkeepers
who objected to a fair in their very midst had something
to do with it? The most uncommon stall was run by Mrs.
L. Haigh and Miss Elsie Josephson (who, with Dr.
Frances Dick, is going to “ do ” Fiji and the New
Hebrides this summer). It was artistically crowded with
clubs, fans, mats, and all sorts of savage ornaments that
turn drawing rooms into wigwams. The most ordinary
stall sold cabbages. On the first day a society crowd
turned up, but the fact that almost everybody wore a
crinkled crepon made them look as if they were all
related to each other.
N.S.W. Women’s Branch of the Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals held its annual meeting the
other day. Many beautiful sentiments w'ere enunciated
from the platform, and an idiot of a reporter “ noticed
that no dead-bird trimmings disfigured any of the
bonnets : ” the poor man didn’t know that the absence of
bird-life was probably due more to the season than to the
society—the deceased tomtit only perches on winter
millinery. It was amusing to hear how everybody patted
Woman on the back—“ her influence would do so much
good in this noble work,” and so on. As a matter of
remorseless fact woman is, on the average, a lot crueller
than man—especially to horses. The average Amazon
rides or drives at top speed, no matter how hard or how
hilly the road is—and the girl who is taken out for a drive
and hasn’t to hold her baton half the time hasn’t enjoyed
it one bit. And ask any livery-stable man if he willingly
gives a “lady” a whip—also, enquire of any woman if
she hasn’t to ask for one every time she goes out! She
gets her whip, and then it’s flick, flick, flick, all the time-
just as it is when she’s driving a man.
And take her in conjunction with other living things—
leaving man, whom, perhaps, she tortures most of all—
completely out of the pic.ure. All fur-covered animals
are murdered principally to keep her warm. Beetles’-
wing embroideries are very fashionable. It was the go
not so long back to entangle fire flies'among a ball-dress,
where they died, of course, but not before they had
gleamed half the night. In my mind’s ear I can hear the
shriek of the ostrich as somebody pulls his tail feathers
out to make fa is or hat-trimmings for his natural enemy
—woman. Astraohan is made curly only by the most
horrible torture to the living sheep—one could multiply
instances indefinitely. I don’t mean to assert, of course,
that there are no humane women, but that to be a woman
doesn’t necessarily mean that you have no scalded dogs
or foundered horses on your conscience. Ask the cat in
any household what she thinks about it!
When the crisp springtime fades to summer's glow the
woman who is faddy about the change of the season, and
yet will put on a revelation bodice to go to the play in,
ought to be very careful that her chest-protector gets
tucked down low enough. At the “English Rose ” the
other night an elegant lady in a silken gown, out very
saucy about the collar-bone, had an inch of flannel “ pro-
teotor” working further up her back every time she
heaved a sympathetic sigh for the heroine’s troubles !
Which somehow reminds me of a story I was told about
a woman who went into a country store and asked for a
porous-plaster the other day. The young man showed
her several samples, which his customer examined
dubiously, and at length unburdened her soul in the
remark: “No, none o’ these will do fer me, young man.
I don’t want none o' yer moth-eaten rubbish.” And then
she departed to find a porous-plaster with no holes in it.
The engagement is announced of Miss Annie M. Sum-
merbelle, the promising young Sydney musician and
author of several bright musical compositions, to Mr.
Bertie Glasson, of Stanfield Station, Oarcoar.
The heartless tricks played on the newdy-married are
quite cruel enough to discourage nervous people from
committing matrimony at all. At a wedding, fiends tie
orange-blossoms on to the cab-horse that bears them
away, with the sole idea of making the poor things look
stupid in the eyes of the world. And they chalk “On
Honeymoon” in big letters all over their luggage, and
generally carry on in an unnatural spirit towards a couple
of people whom they have hitherto seemed to respect and
admire.
But a striking instance of presence of mind, under
embarrassing circumstances, akin to the above, was dis-
played by a recently-married widow, who particularly
objected to anybody taking her for a bride. So she
assumed a bored and chilly aspect, and “he” looked
sadly out of the train window, and nobody had the least
suspicion until he suddenly whipped out his handkerchief,
and lo ! there was a shower of rice with which some kind
friend had filled his pocket! Everybody grinned, and
started into life at once, but the ex-widdy was equal to
the occasion. “That’s the worst of attending these tire-
some weddings,” she said, languidly, “one gets as much
rice over one as the principal people! ”
At last woman is learning to call a spade a spade and
not mince matters so gingerly where matrimony is con-
cerned. Take this advt., for instance, from a Sydney
daily
T ADY (23) desires to marry for sake of a home;
widower not objected to. Veritas, G.P.O.
She puts the thing fairly and squarely as a fair business
exchange, you see. She is willing to assume the varie-
gated rose fetters of matrimony for the practical con-
sideration of three meals per diem and a water-tight roof.
She doesn’t ask for a husband with Family Herald legs
and a waxed moustache—she doesn’t specify at all what
sort of man is to go with the house. She is really willing
to marry from four rooms and a kitchen upwards, and the
proprietor can be anything in reason, evidently. But it is
strange that this eminently practical young person doesn’t
meditate going to Gaol instead. It would, if my observa-
tions are worth anything, turn out in the end to be a far
more agreeable way of getting board and lodging than the
other plan.
But it isn’t always a woman who boldly throws the
handkerchief to Hymen in the agony columns of the
newspapers. Here is an appeal, also from a Sydney
paper, which won’t be long unanswered, I’m sure :
IX/TATRlMONY.—lndustrious GENT., 26, possessing
nice station property, commodious homestead,
carriages, servants, &c., wishes to correspond with a
nice clever young Lady, Prot., in view of above.
Add. C.8.A., P. 0., Bourke.
Don’t all speak at once! One “young lady Prot.” at a
time, please !
Apropos ads., this is rather a choice example of insidious
innocence from Sydney D.T.
T ADY, well connected, would Manage gentleman’s
home, girl kept, wages no obj. Florrie, Rand-
wick P.O.
But this is obviously only another short cut to the altar.
A “lady” who advertises that she is willing to keep
house and wrestle with a servant girl, just for “ love,”
must simply be spoiling for matrimony, I should say.
Australian wit is sometimes rather personal. The other
evening a very tall, very thin, and shadowy swell was
standing like a note of interrogation awaiting the tram,
when a small newsboy struck an attitude in front of him
and said briskly: “ Ta-ta, old boy, meet you in the bone-
yard !”
The Infants’ Carnival is upon us and every public-hall
is thronged with friends and relatives and performing
cherubs and heated instructors. The State-schools are
especially prominent in the entertainment line, and
whether the idea is to have every infant looking stage-
wards before it’s got its second teeth or just to discourage
them from trying to exist without excitement is an un-
answered query.
At one public-school operatic outbreak, the other day,
a “ Gaiety ” skirt-dance by a very small girl was an item
—but unless the little victim is foredoomed to the foot-
lights her prowess in the high-kick will not be of much
use to her. Public dancing and singing and “dressing-
up” among the rank-and-file of State-school children
only unsettle them for a plain prosaic life, which will
doubtless be the fate of most of ’em. Because the world
must have household help, and what sort of a servant i 8
agirl likely to make who has been taught the ta-ra-ra kick
and operetta arias ? Certainly her kick may be a bovine
plunge and her song like the shriek of a locust, but still
she feels that the artistic world is her home—and her
soul is miles above boiling a potato.
The question of the hour is how long will domestic
help be available ? The Australian-born daughter of the
emigrated plain cook is a lady who objects to being-
called “ Mariar ” and ordered to skim the gravy, and
unless domestic service is conducted on the “ oblige me
by frying these sausages, Miss O’Flannigan” principle,
the whole nation of damsels will bolt into shops and
factories, leaving the house-wives to give and take their
orders themselves.
In America, it would appear, only immigration supplies
servants, and when that is cut off the ’Murkan matron
will either have to shake hands with her cook or go with-
out her. “The problem of housekeeping,” saith an
authority, “will never be solved in a free and democratic
country on any other basis than that of social equality.”
And the prophecy is equally applicable to Australia. For
one “servant” who advertises for a place there are ten
“ young ladies ” who would “ help in home,” and so on.
To do them justice, they always state “ wages no object,”
so they are prepared to pay for their dignity, anyhow.
But I sometimes think that if men were chiefs of the
kitchen, domestic insurrections would be fewer. Women
hate to be managed by women—and that, more than the
desire for independence (which isn’t a feminine charac-
teristic) drives them into factories and shops, where a
man is always the real head. If it were only the “ in-
equality” that was the matter, that veneered slavey, the
“lady help,” who sits at table and is introduced to every-
body, ought to be as merry as a grig.
Yours affectionately,

John Gourlay closed his season at Sydney
Garrick on Saturday, and that house is tem-
porarily deserted. John’s last night was a
delirious hash of all sorts of comedy with the in-
variable “Living Models” at the conclusion.
Mr. Cosgrove having gone away to be a fierce
Irish villain at Her Majesty’s, his former part was
taken by Mr. Scot Inglis, a pallid gentleman who
seems somewhat nervous in places, but who pro-
mises well for the future. Also, Mr. H. Shine,
having got tired of being an Irish ruffian wid a
shtick at Her Majesty’s, came back and lent a
hand. During Mr. Gourlay’s season he has intro-
duced to the people of Sydney the lady with the
shortest frock on record, also the lady whose
dress is cut lower at the neck than any other
dress ever seen in these parts, and in other ways
he has deserved well of the community. Concern-
ing his partner, Mr. Walton, The Bulletin critic
has an ancient grudge against that gentleman, and
though he has tried to view him with a kindly
eye the attempt hasn’t been a great success.
About nine years ago The Bulletin man made a
short voyage in Mr. Walton’s society, and in the
course of four days’ whist found him to be one of
the most cantankerous card-players on record.
* * *
The Bulletin has still further considered
Mr. Lionel Rignold at Her Majesty’s (Sydney),
and its opinion on that gentleman is still sus-
pended. He undoubtedly plays the part of Nicu-
demus Dickenson with very great success, but it is
not a character that admits of much originality.
There is a species of comedy that consists princi-
pally in a red-headed man hoarsely demanding a
pint of “four ’arf,” and of this is the stage-
cockney compounded. There is always a kind of
unctuous huskiness in his voice, like a man who
talks in a loud whisper through a feather-bed,
which variety of utterance is supposed to arise
from fog and gin ; he is bow-legged, red-faced,
and generally walks sideways, like a crab; he
wears strange and horrible clothes ; he is frowsy,
leery, and wildly cocksure about everything in this
world or the next, and he looks as if he slept with
the dog. And even though all London may rise
in insurrection. The Bulletin hereby records its
conviction that the best stage-cockney on record is
a poor, bald, stereotyped institution, fit only to
rank with the stage-policeman (there is not in
the whole world, there never was and
there never will oe a better stage - policeman than
Sweeney of Her Majesty’s) and the wicked
baronet, and that it is a most depressing character
to witness. The fact that Mr. L. Rignold has
played the part of Nicodemus many hundred times
in England, only makes us feel sorry for every-
body concerned. Miss Hilda Spong seems more
confident than she was on the first night, and the
scenery, which is surpassingly beautiful, grows
upon us every day; but the piece wants a new
villain as much as ever. Mr. Cosgrove could
play the nice, little curate to perfection, but he
doesn’t fit the clothes of the big, masterful villain,
and he seems to commit murder feebly somehow.

Fillis’ circus is prospering more and more
as the days go by, and as an additional attraction
the management has turned on Mdlle. Jasia
Scherazade —apparently out of the “Arabian
Nights”—the “first lady lion-tamer that ever
appeared in the Southern Hemisphere.” Mdlle.
Scherazade is a plump and nice-looking person,
and when the common fate of her profession over-
takes her, The Bulletin will congratulate the lion
that gets the first bite. A lion that wanted to
keep himself up with a little snack could hardly
find anything more appetising than Mademoiselle
Jasia. The other Sydney shows are feeling much
as usual, and despite the near approach of Xmas,
no unusual festivity is apparent. Messrs. Wil-
liamson and Musgrove announce that they have
taken the Lyceum for a term of years, and will
commence business about the 24th, but the public
still yearns after full particulars and gets them
not. Also, the management of the Royal, at the
time of going to press, continues to maintain a
dead silence that can be heard for miles.

When the trustees of N.S.W. National
Art Gallery decided to spend a certain sum of
money in the purchase of strictly Australian
works by Australian artists, it was recognised to
be a step in the right direction. It was an
encouragement to our painters to leave the beaten
track of conventionalism and to produce works
representative of local life and manners. But,
good as the idea was in its conception, the way in
which it has been carried out up to now shows
that it is predestined to failure. No better proof
of this could be found than in the result of the
competition just concluded. The trustees in their
prospectus announced that twelve of the pictures
sent in would be bought, provided, of course, that
so many were up to standard ; but nevertheless
the judges have decided to purchase only five of
the drawings. There would be, perhaps, no great
cause for complaint on this score had the choice
made been judicious, but we submit that anyone
with the slightest knowledge of the subject can, on
viewing the show, see at a glance that such is not
the case. * J. R. Ashton’s “ Terrigal Headland”
should undoubtedly have been bought, as it is
beyond question the best work of his the writer
has ever seen. The wave-drawing is particularly
good, and the only fault one can find with the
picture is that the cloud resting on the
horizon is lacking in gradation. W. L. Lister’s
view of the entrance to Port Stephens,,
with its cleverly treated sand - bank in the
foreground, has also fine qualities, but in many
respects it is inferior to both his “Page Valley”
and his “Myall River,” also exhibited. Of the
other three purchases it is not possible to speak,
except in terms of the strongest condemnation. J.
S. Diston’s “ Broken Hill ’’ (an unpromising sub-
ject), is nut without merit, but its monotonous
colour and amateurishly-painted sky render it
unworthy of a place in any public gallery : while
Mr. E. B. Boulton’s mountain scene is simply a
carefully stippled drawing of the Birket Foster
school, utterly lacking in strength. The best that
can be said of A. J. Fischer’s “Cradling in
Golden Gully ” is that it is superior to any of the
previous productions of the same artist. There
are good points in the drawing, as, for example, in
the treatment of the river-bed and the distant
hills, but the figures are ill-drawn, and altogether
the work is quite below the standard which
should entitle it to a permanent place in a
national collection of works of art. But when one
turns from the pictures mentioned and con fern -

plates the field from which the judges had to
choose, one’s astonishment at their decision is
increased fourfold. Streeton’s scholarly drawing
of the “Valley of the Mittagong” is beyond ques-
tion the finest landscape in the whole collection.
Then, again, A. H. Full wood has surpassed him-
self in his “ Mitchell’s Bridge, Victoria Bass,” in
which, by the way, the work is advantageously
brought to a higher finish than is usual with this
artist. E. P. Mahoney’s drawing of a bullock-
team resting by the wayside, not only shows a
distinct advance on any of his previous efforts in -
the same medium, but the subject is thoroughly
characteristic of bush-life; and Mr. Minus’s land-
scapes,, with their delicate warm greys, and the
excellent treatment of the skies, should certainly
have received more consideration at the hands of
the judges. The moral of these competitions,
good as they are in intention, seems to be that,
while the decision is left to persons who appear
crassly ignorant, the more competent local artists
will prefer to take their chance iu the open market
to running the risk of having their talents mis-
judged.

Max O’Rell has been taken by R. S.
Smythe to Riverina, which must have been
very familiar ground to the Much-Travelled. It
was at Deniliquin, 33 years ago, that he edited
a weekly squatting newspaper, receiving _£l2 a
week, probably the highest salary ever paid to a
country editor. What changes the old wanderer
must have noticed since his time, when the jovial
John Kelly was police - magistrate, and the
Desaillys owned Coree, and D. G. J ones ran the
Pastoral Times, and Tom Robertson was pound-
keeper, and the genial Dr. Morrison kept open
house, and the veteran Dr. Noyes was a nevv-
churn, and the Royal Hotel was a wooden shanty
where overlanders drank champagne, and Nebu-
chadnezzar Tyson had a run on the north bank of
the Edward, unmolested by free selectors ! And
Deniliquin still boasts of its “ culchaw. The
residents turned out in evening-dress at Max
ORell’s show, nearly everybody went into the
front seats, and the ladies made Smythe promise
that Max should give them another night when he
came back from Maoriland.

One week’s run sufficed to exhaust “ A
White Lie ”at Melbourne Bijou. The burden of
an unintelligent child was more than its weak
back-bone could boar, and the unsolved doubt as
to what really became of the evil dude was a mill-
stone round its neck. The play provtd nothing
except the absurdity of a married woman falling
in love with another fellow when her husband is
snoozing on the sofa hard by, and certain to wake
up presently. Moreover, one grows tired of the
stage lady who doesn’t take ordinary precautions
to prevent these unpleasantnesses. She is ag in
nature, and any rational husband would east her
off for ever, for being a fool. On Saturday, the
farewell fortnight of B. & B. was inaugurated
with a revival of “The Solicitor,” or the
“Misery of a Hansom Cab.” Brough repeated
his indiscretion of driving a cab for a wager, and
Mrs. Brough engaged the vehicle under suspicious
circumstances as of old. Two giddy men in
buckram repeated their former endeavours to
trifle with the fresh young affections of the cab-
man’s daughter, and an all-round discovery of every-
body else in a secret hiding-place occurred once
again. “ The Solicitor ” is worth seeing at any
time. Now that the Bijou company are about to
leave their old haunt for an indefinite period, it
behoves Melbourne folks to hurry up and be there
for the sake of auld lang syne. They laugh best
who laugh last, and the nights for laughing at B.
and B.’s farcical comedies are numbered and
ticketed. Next Saturday (10th) the menu will be
changed again to “ A Village Priest. ’

As Abbe Dubois in “A Village Priest”
the one and only Titheradge takes his benefit on
Monday night. Tith. has given his talents freely
for the benefit of mankind, and mankind is ex-
pected to reciprocate by bestowing a fraction of
its spare “ talents ” on Titheradge for just once in
a way. The pecuniary compliment has been well
earned. Five nights in all are set apart for “A
Village Priest,” and one consecutive performance
of “The Magistrate” will play the Brough and
Boucioauit company off the premises they have so
long adorned. This sad event is to occur on
Friday, the Kith inst.

Likewise, the Gaiety Co., in their present
combination, are about to bid Melbourn) adieu.
Individual members will presently appear in
divers pantomimes, but as exponents of the legiti-
mate leg-drama in Australia they have almost
finished their engagement. “Miss Esmeralda”
is announced to end on Saturday, and a painful
rumour that the Princess’ will close its doors for
the next fortnight is in the air. In which case,
the city will be without a theatre where the weary
scribe can rest his legs during the week before
Christmas. Meanwhile, “ Miss Euneralda ”
spells big business, and Lonnen’s Australian edi-
tion of “Mrs. ’Enry ’Awkins”has touched the
gods on a tender spot. Poor old Nellie Farren is
much missed in the leading “ boy part, but the
general effect is good enough. Also, the staging
is consistently gorgeous, and the young men in
the circle resemble one another in their beauty,
like so many green peas in a pod.
#* * *
The music-halls are doing their best to
tide over the time of trouble which always comes
to shows just before Xmas. The Gaiety is open
as usual and the Coghill Bros, have put fortli a
strong variety bill at St. George’s where the
maximum price is a modest lt is here
that Will Whitburn takes the shine out of
Lonnen’s larrikin song, Whitburn being in-
digenous to the soil and having considered the
lilies of the “push” how they grow, from his
youth upwards. But the study of larrikins and
costers has gone far enough, one fancies. A
“comic” ditty purveyor possessed of a taste for
impersonating gentlemen would be a genuine
novelty. It is desirable, too, that Melbourne
audiences should get a notion of what a gentle-
man, expensively dressed or otherwise, looks like
on a platform.

The Greenwood family have been doing
very good business at the Adelaide Royal. Miss

General, and a cousin of the Greenwoods, makes

amateur concert platform in at least three of the

At Melbourne Princess, on a recent night, the chatter
nuisance in the circle was very pronounced for some time,
but was promptly suppressed by a man who knew neither
fear nor Mrs. Grundy. To the friends between whom he
sat he simply said, “ I’ll stop those chattering fools. You
fellows prepare to look unconscious. They did their
best, and just as the cackle was again becoming painful,
the centre man remarked, in a voice that permeated the
whole theatre like a cold shiver, “ D nit all, give the
actor a show, can’t you?” For the rest of that evening
you could have cut the silence with a hunk of hoopHion.
Which recalls a parallel case at the Opera House. The
offenders were a showy society woman and a certain aide-
de-camp. She was another man’s wife, and ho had come
chiefly to spoon her, such being his playful habit. 1 re-
gently when theirvoiees rose to toohigb a whisper, someone
behind said, “ Hush, there! ” He scowled, she pursed
her lips, neither ceased. Then came another loudei
“ Hush, there ! ” Still the murmur went on. Then a
voice as of thunder, “ Look here, you two, shut up, oi go
home ! ” They were silent, and at the end of the first act
a hansom received them, and they passed off into outei
darkness.
Arthur Garner again appears as a polite letter-writer—
this time in London. (His last victim was Jimmy
Thompson, of Melbourne Standard.) Arthur, who has
had a law-suit on with a certain Londoner, well known in
Australia, sends this (o his opponent’s solicitor:— Sir,—
Mr. has informed me of the statement you made re-
garding my character on Monday last whilst applying for
a further postponement of the case ‘ v. '• Lpon
meetino- your client later in the day, I questioned him as
to your'authority for such statement, and after .saying,
(i stly, that he knew nothing about it, he wound up hy
declinin')* to give any information on the subject. I then
told him emphatically that whoever is responsible is a
liar. I now repeat this assertion to you, with the timber
comment that if you took upon yourself to tell the he on
vour own responsibility, the cowardice of the proceeding
is accentuated by the fact of your being sheltered profes-
sionally from tiie pu lishment such conduct deserves.
Thiwhout this vexatious action (now entered upon its
seeond year) 1 have endeavoured to fight fairly, and my
instructions to my solicitors have a’ways been to extend
all courtesy to the opposite side, and 1 have never
descended to the contemptible trick of making lying
statements as to the personal character of my opponent.
Two wrongs does not make on ; right, so I shall continue
the same line of conduct hitherto adopted by me during
this action, though probably neither you nor your client
can appreciate or understand the instinctive honour that
guides and controls the behaviour of an English gentle-
man.—Yours truly, Arthur Garner.”
Herbert Flemming, writes The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent by last mail, is out of the bill at the Haj-
market, but Mrs. Langtry lias offered him an engagement
at £l5 per week to play in a curtain-raiser. Herbert
hesitates to accept, and thinks it somewhat infra dig. to
take part in a front piece. He is putting on flesh rapidly,
and is anything but an ideal lover in looks. He is, how-
ever, considered to be a coming man.
It is impossible to reconcile Herbert Standing s remaiks
about Australia, said to have been made in Ceylon, with
what he says in London. “Here,” writes The Bulletin
correspondent, “he is enthusiastic in praise of the Land of
the Kangaroo. There must lie two Standings, as there
were two Philips of Macedon.”
The just-deceased Mrs. Avins performed in the first play
ever acted in Melbourne. It was just half-a-century ago,
at a place next to the Eagle Tavern, on the present Bull

brated Jacky Tommy Smith, Melbourne’s Whittington,
ran the Queen’s Theatre, with his friend Ooppm.
Dan Fitzgerald is said to have a cage of lions Jn train-
ing. “ Daniel in the Lions’ Den ” would “ take ”as well

legs !
A former Melbourne conductor once said to Woodfleld
at a “ Chiiperic ” dress rehearsal: “ When will you learn
to sing?” The vocalist didn’t say when, but shook a
whip fn the amorous one’s face, with the remark, “ If you
abuse me before the chorus, I’ll thrash you. Theic was
no more abuse that season.
South African Mining Argus viciously remarks (simply
because a certain local manager, well-known in Australia,
refused to allow one woman under engagement to him to
dance “Ta-ra-ra” at another woman's benefit) that Mr.
Blank, F.R.G.S. (Fellow of the Royal Gasometrical
Societv), is “ a nasty, quarrelsome, spiteful, little gasbag,
predestined to an inglorious fizzle and frizzle through the
spontaneous combustion of his own superabundant gois.

When President Zeal bought the dress-circle at Mel-
bourne Princess’s for his Parliamentary night he also
hired the adjacent bar for self and friends only. The
outside public were refused admission to licensed premises
on this gorgeous occasion, an arrangement which,
although presumably an outrage against the law', pre-
vented the vulgar herd from discovering how many mem-
bers of the Senate were taking too much to drink. Poor
creatures in the amphitheatre were able to estimate the
consumption of free liquor by the dress-circle’s “ breff,’
which floated upwards along with the other hot air.

figures, as the bodies of the lover and their three illegiti-

then she is strangled before the audience.
Bruiser Corbett is going on the stage with a new drama
which seems to be written for the express purpose of
goading that miserable tough, Charley Mitchell, on to
single combat. Mitchell is the bad character of the
drama—a beery, dropsical rowdy, who is always drunk,
and always offering to lick anyone in the blessed
country. At last he insults the memory of Corbett’s
mother, and that gentleman welts him to such an extent
that he becomes practically unrecognisable. If Mitchell
ever sees this play the betting is that he will rush the
stage and start laying the company out with a chair-leg.

them successfully, there is a howl of applause which

“the greatest force in Australian politics.” Not
force, but farce. Probably a telegraphic error.
From an article on Tennyson, in S.A.
Register, Monday, Nov. 28 : “ The poet rose to
his grandest height as the prophet of the hope of
immorality.”
When Queen Victoria lately visited Baron
Ferdinand de Rothschild at Waddesden she never
even once invited her host to take a meal with
her, but ate in solemn silence with Princess
Beatrice. Amiable old lady !
Professor Reutoul, Presbyterian parson,
of Ormond College, Melbourne, gets bold adver-
tisement in a big illustrated London weekly,
which publishes twice in the same issue a para-
graph stating that Tennyson thought the best
estimate of his poems was a lecture by Renton!
thereon two or three years ago. He wrote to the
Professor to say so. too.
Dear Bulletin, —The licensee of an Aus-
tralian city public-house does not always keep his
hat on when serving, to distinguish him from his
barman. He very often takes off his hat and
tucks up his shirt-sleeves in order that he may be
taken for a barman by casual customers. Useful
wrinkles and gems of information are thereby
gleaned—and he knows who are Hebe’s best
friends. —Yours, Old Dromore.
Victor Houghton, who suicided at Coogee
the other day, after writing so cool a letter to the
Coroner, had a chequered career. Educated in
Germany (the home of suicide), he was a N.S.W.
O.S. surveyor for some years, came into money
and married money, knocked it all down racing
and mining, and separated from his wife. He was
famous during one whole day, having ridden over
the big jumps at Randwick without mistake, for a
considerable wager.
Edward O’Donoghue, the “ silenced ”
priest, a very well-known, clerically - garbed
character in Melbourne, who got six months for
vagrancy last week, was known to many as
“Teddy Royce,” which pleasant person he re-
sembled facially to a surprising degree. O’Dono-
ghue had capped a lengthy cadging career by
striking a well-known medico for 12s. (id., and
then crossing the road to another with the same
yarn about wanting a fare to Sydney for a poor
man. Medico No. 1 followed him, gave him
away, and then gave him in charge. In court,
O’Donoghue informed the Bench that he “got
.£lOO a year from Le Temps, Freeman’s Journal
and Cork Examiner, by writing the usual letter;’
also, that he had property in Brisbane.
There are in England about 14,000 parsons
of the Established Church, and of these last year
375 were found guilty of various offences. Four-
teen were in trouble for breach of promise ; 18 for
cruelty to animals; 17 for elopement (7 of these went
off with someone else’s wife, and the rest mostly
went off with a female under age and neglected
to marry her); 12 suicided ; 121 were arrested for
drunkenness ; 109 for assault; and the rest were
charged with seduction, perjury, obtaining money
under false pretences, unpublishable crimes, and
miscellaneous offences. In England the average
number of convictions is 2GG out of every 100,000
population. Therefore, the parsons of the Estab-
lished Church are just about 12 times more
criminal and more beastly, on an average, than
the rest of the community. And yet people want
to know why clerical influence is on the decline
and people don’t respect the Church,
According to N.Y. Recorder, there are
at least two suicide-clubs iu the States, one in
Chicago, the other in Philadelphia. One J. Bar-
low Morehead suicided iu the latter city on
Monday, Oct. 3, “as per club.” The club in
Philadelphia consists of 17 members, and meets
once a year, on Good Friday, to elect a president.
On taking the oath of office, he vows to kill him-
self within a year by shooting, time and place
being left to his own discretion. There is also
a clause in the rules providing that some other
member may be told off for suicide in addition
to the president. Another queer club in New
York is “The Last Man Club.” Founded about
ten years ago, it originally consisted of thirteen
members. Once a year since then the club has
met. At the table are thirteen seats, with plates
for thirteen diners, and overhead is a chandelier
with thirteen jets. The wine is drunk from
human skulls to uncanny toasts. At the opening
of the feast the president calls the original roll.
Originally every member swore to be present at
every feast —in body, if alive; in spirit, if dead.
Therefore, although, for each unanswered name,
the president turns out one light, a dinner is
served all the same before each vacant chair, the
spirit of the departed being supposed to be seated
in his place. There will probably come a time
when at that annual feast there will be but one
living person. On that chandelier only one light
will be burning. In the twelve vacant chairs
will be twelve ghosts. That “Last Man” will
suicide that night, and the next meeting of the
club will be in the fields of asphodel.
BILL ANDREWS’ CHUM.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A seedy wreck is my actor friend
With his pose of studied grace,
And the nasal blossoms that softly blend
With the grease-paint on his face.
And bis grating chuckles that ever seem
Like the grit of a coffee-mill,
And his doleful tales of the old rigime,
And the days when he played with “ Bill.”
You talk of Anson and Boucioauit,
And Brough, why, I’d swap them all
To see Ruth Oakley on the show
With Rayner playing Paul ;
And “ Tiddywinks ” Collins and Russell, too,
And Dicky Stewart and Hill,
Bill Andrews—why, where’s your actor now
That can “ cackle ” a part like “ Bill ? ”
He’d wander on through the Thespian maze
Till the beer made his voice grow thick,
’Mid the shadowy scenes of the palmy days
On the boards of the “ good old Vic.”
To vary the subject I’d try in vain.
For, in spite of my utmost skill,
He’d wrestle away and begin again,
On the days when he played with “ Bill.”
Poor fellow, he once was respected and rich,
Now he plays “ The carriage waits,”
And says that they always “queer his pitch ”
As he’s “ multy on his plates ; ”
But he’ll drink to the joy of other days,
Let the pain come now if it will,
Till the Prompter Death rings dow n the baize
On his happy dreams of “ Bill.”

now.
Fitzgibbon, of Melbourne Board of Works,
went to London to borrow two millions sterling.

Matvieff, the popular superintendent of

said old Matvieff, “I suppose it’s because you’re

Mr. “Jones,” the Melb. hangman, when

It is no secret that a certain very well-

They are telling a gruesome tale in Bris-

condemned man in his cell. He told the miserable
wretch all about Gehenna, and then finished by
taking up a collection, and when the congregation,

mundane possession, adirty£snote, to the “caws,”
the good man took it and departed in peace.
The Bulletin’s London correspondent:
It may do a good turn to someone if I state that
the sum of £667 9s. 3d. awaits claims from the
heirs of William Stuart Scott, “ late of Australia,”
at the Cape. The Curator of Intestate Estates at
Cape Town is the person to apply to. Strict proof
of heirship is required, but no unnecessary official
routine stands in the way of those entitled to it
getting the money.
The “image” of Governor Norman exists
in the person of a Brisbane cabby. The likeness
is accentuated by the fact that both dress most
unpretentiously, the former from choice, the
latter, perhaps, from necessity. More than one
near-sighted dame has given the jarvie a sweeping
bow, in mistake. One went so far as to enquire
after “ her dear Ladyship and Miss Grace” before
discovering the error.
Father Kernen, defendant in the late
Walsh will-case in Melbourne, was fellow-priest
at South Sydenham, London, with Rev. Addis,
now assistant to Dr. Strong at the Australian
Church. Addis “changed his views,” married
the lady sacristan, and came to Australia.
Kernen remained a celibate, but came to Aus-
tralia also, and settled down in Collingwood,
close to the gilded Walsh.
Mysterious hints of “surprises” and
“ unexpected light,” in store for the public at the
hearing of the Speight v. Syme action, are finding
their way into Age paragraphs. The Age is evi-
dently getting frightened. On the other hand,
Speight is saying nothing about the light that he
intends to shed upon certain political arrange-
ments. Meanwhile, they are betting 2 to 1 in
Melbourne against the chance of the cause celhbre
ever coming into court.
Sir Saul Samuel, N.S.W. Agent-General,
has in his possession a book with the inscription :
“To the Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone,
with the respectful compliments of Henry Parkes”
—given him by a man who picked it up in a book-
shop for a couple of shillings. Evidently the
G.O.M. doesn’t think much of his shoddy
“colonial” imitator, or he wouldn’t have dis-
carded the presentation, which, however, perhaps
didn’t cost Parkes much, as it bears the Govern-
ment imprint. Which reminds one that Marmier,
one of the French “ Immortals,” in rummaging at
a city bookstall, came across one of his own works
which he had presented to a literary confrere. He
bought the book, got it most expensively bound,
and sent it back to his friend, with a note saying
that he hoped he would keep it this time for the
sake of the binding.
Sir Edwin T. Smith (S.A.), who made his
triple Mayoralty of Adelaide, and his parlia-
mentary position, and his bauble, out of Beer, is
about to retire from politics and go travelling.
His constituents are getting tired, he hears the
roar of the political deluge, and is going in out of
the wet. He was once a cellarman; became an
Adelaide brewer’s drummer; then a junior
partner ; finally blossomed into the Bismarck of a
brewery. The Smith, as a politician, has no more
brains than a plaster-of-paris image ; but he has
got along by the amiability of his character, and
the immense profits from “tied ” and other public-
houses. In public opinion, he is at least a semi-
millionaire.
While on circuit to Roma (Q.) lately,
Judge Paul inadvertently left behind him, at
Dalby, his official wig and robes. But Geo.
Byrne, who was prosecuting for the Crown, had
not been so remiss, and, at the Judge’s request,
lent him his own paraphernalia. When the court
opened, barrister Byrne rose to make an apology :
“ Your Honor, I wish to crave your indulgence.
The weather is so hot that I have felt obliged to
appear before you without my wig and gown.
Will you excuse me?” “Certainly,” said Paul,
without the flicker of a smile; “ I should have
done the same as you under the circumstances.
What is the first case?”
The latest portrait of Her Gracious on
English post-card stamps is a characteristic
fiction. The Queen is here represented as a tall,
slim, graceful widow of comparatively tender
years, holding her fan in a eoquettishly regal
style. The most grovelling of illustrated papers
never conceived so flagrant a violation of the
truth as the post-card stamp designer was guilty
of. Victoria Regina happens to be a thick set,
old lady, with a specially large head, standing
sft. Sin. in low-heeled shoes, and weighing some-
where between 12 and 15 stone, and if loyalty to
the Throne requires feeding with attractive pic-
tures of an imaginary monarch, it must be a sickly
sentiment indeed.
New setting of an old fable : “ Dives fares
sumptuously every day on the crumbs purloined
from the wallet of Lazarus.”— Thorold Rogers.
Poor old King Tavvhiao (Maoriland) has
“commanded” the Maoriland Government to
attend a Royal Court to be held at His Majesty’s
whare, May 8, ’93, “ to hear the words that may
then be uttered.”
Alfred Joseph, the cheery, moon-faced
Bendigo metallician, has made a half-crown book
entitled “A Bendigonian Abroad,” about his
travels in foreign lands. It is somewhat curious
that no one has ever heard Mr. Joseph talk in the
Victoria Club or the betting-paddock in the chatty
yet superior manner observed in his book, wherein
he insinuates himself as a judge of the cuisine, of
cigars, of wines, of opera, of painting, of sculpture,
of politeness, of couriers, of cremation, and of
music, besides evincing an intimate knowledge of
modern and ancient history, about which he is
able to patter familiarly as one in whose grasp it
is all nutshelled. Unlike his immediate author-
predecessor (Nehemiah Bartley), Alf. doesn’t
seem to have an all-approving eye for lovely
woman, but gives his readers the idea of a
man who, when in foreign parts, ever sighs
for a slice of underdone Australian beef. Alfred,
we regret to notice, holds Monarehial views,
and strongly disapproves of Republicanism
which reminds us that we have yet to meet a
Republican bookmaker. Space permits not of
our following the distinguished author in his
wanderings, save perhaps to note that in the
States he rooted out a Mormon with four wives
and 17 brats, and that at Honolulu, on the road
home to Bendigo to skin the lamb, he was dis-
gusted to find that even the red seal of the Ballarat
Corporation, held by a fellow traveller, was power-
less to obtain an interview with the dusky queen.
Thus do Alfred’s most sacred feelings well up in
peroration :
What feelings of joy fill our hearts ! Home,
home ! Once more to see our dfar ones, and the many
friends for whom our affection has been but intensified
by absence. ... As we try to sleep in the Sydney
express train, which is flying towards Melbourne, silently
we offer a prayer of gratitude to the Great King of Kings
for His bounteous mercy
“Ten to one bar one !” is shouted right under-
neath the reviewer’s window, and he therefore
can’t pray with Joseph.
The Great Race.
The race for the Melbourne Cup of 1892 lias
come and gone, and the anticipations of thou-
sands of people for a year have disappeared in
something under the space of four minutes—some
are richer (and more poorer) by those four
minutes’ experience, in which tens of thousands
felt an intoxication something akin to the in-
fluence of wine. There is a greater race than
even this enormous Cup event. From birth until
old age man is engaged in a contest with Death ;
and only those who are swifter than the Reaper
stay above ground for any length of time. Have
you never felt as a young man the pride of simply
being? You experience it most on a spring morn-
ing, when you enjoy the true health of absolute
unconsciousness as to the possession of heart, lungs,
kidneys, liver, or any digestive apparatus at all.
You are almost strong enough to walk indefinitely,
or you feel that a push of your powerful shoulder
could force down a wall. As for Death, you laugh
at him ; you snap your lingers in his face and
defy his power : and by-and-bye you distance him,
and he remains a crest-fallen laggard, miles away
in your rear. But there comes a day when your
step is slow and your eyes are dimned, and Death,
aided by Disease —who is one of his progenitors
catches you again, and repays you all the insults
and sneers you gave him in the days of your
strength while he races neck and neck with you
for the goal. And in these days of unnatural
business excitement, and rapid living and think-
ing, the greatest aid of the dreaded dark horse,
who is galloping so steadily and so silently, is
that most common scourge, kidney disease. Uric
acid poison is the most fruitful cause of disease.
Bright’s disease, rheumatism, gout, gravel, stone,
and numerous other complaints are directly
traceable to its presence in the blood. The only
medicines so far known having any direct and
permanent curative effect on these diseases are
Warner’s Safe Cure and Bills. They have proved
their efficacy beyond cavil, while additional sub-
stantiation of their wonderful influence is coming
in day by day.

POLITICAL POINTS
Friends of Bible-reading in State schools
are busy hunting up the S.A. electors.
Paradox from a S.A. gubernatorial speech:
“The Governor of a .self-governing colony,” &c.
The Age now derides the Shiels Govern-
ment, and calls it “the Considering Ministry.”
N.S.W, Upper House begins its slaughter
by throwing out Walker’s Reduction of Costs of
Litigation Bill.
It is averred that Ewing, M.P., is getting
ready for a merciless Parliamentary onslaught
upon Jawbone Neild.
Brisbane Courier proposes the enquiry
“whether, and to what extent, wage-slavery
obtains in our institutions.”
Stradbroke Island, Moreton Bay, has been
proclaimed a leper lazaret. The ghastly list of
lepers lengthens every week.
Political rumours have it that the relations
between N.S.W. Premier Dibbs and “Works”
Lyne are those of rats and phosphorus.
In N.S.W. the example of Maoriland is
now being followed, union-meetings (in many
instances) being held with closed doors.
Horse-doctor Stewart, M.L.C., openly
says that the N.S.W. Ministry desire the defeat
of the Elections Act in the Upper House.
Last season the S.A. harvest averaged
about 4 bushels ; this season, is confidently
expected, with an exportable surplus of 314,002
tons.
A Victorian politician, sued for a doctor’s
bill, pleads as a set-off that he got the sawbones

Fitchett rightly remarks that should Sir
Charles Lilley “ return to politics, and lead the
Labour-party, politics in Queensland will grow

A nice Government representative, Salo-
mons. His Upper House speech in favour of the
N.S.W. Electoral Bill was mere damnation by
faint praise.
As The Bulletin long ago pointed out,
one of the dodges of the N.S.W. squatter is to
get country, liable to selection, proclaimed
“ forest-reserves.”
Apropos Womanhood Suffrage in the Isle
of Man. It is explained that the right is guarded
by a property qualification and is confined to
spinsters and widows.
The Victorian public wanted a Protec-
tionist Government, but when Shiels starts pro-
tecting Matthew Davies, they begin to regard it
as M'Kinleyism run mad.
Somebody should lay on the table of the
Vic. Assembly a full list of members who are too
hopelessly insolvent to be able to go straight,
commencing with—but no matter.
John Davies, M.L.C. : “Socialists are
responsible for all the trouble that has occurred in
N.S.W.” Not all. They aren’t responsible for
the existence of John Hornsby Davies.
Premier Downer (S.A.) protests that he
lias nothing whatever to do with the National
Defence League or its policy. He claims to be a
Liberal with a trend towards Radicalism.
Ex-Speaker Groom (Q.), just returned from
>Ome, says that the revival of the Kanaka slave-
trade has created the impression in England that
Queensland is not a white man’s country.
The Governor of British New Guinea com-

S.A. Municipal elections, all over the prc-

Legislative Council wants to throw out for the

Dear Bulletin, Apropos the Parlia-
mentary debate on the N.S.W. Forestry Depart-
ment. perhaps some member will call for a detailed

Another great job ! Overtures are again
being made to S.A. Government for a grant of
land 120 miles wide, in return for the construction
of a railway from Euela, on the W. A. border, to
Fort Augusta.
Someone with a black flowing beard has
been round the Sydney shops collecting the
Broken Hill petition signatures ahead of the
Trades and Labour Council. They put it down to
the National Ass.
Sir William Manning (N.S.W.) believes
that the police and military would still do their
duty, though granted votes, but that “ it is better
not to tempt them they’re perfectly honest
but need watching.
Despite the heavy strike-time decrease in
mineral freightage, S. A. State railways returned

A Collingwood (Melb.) tradesman boldly

“For the first time since taking the leadership of
the Opposition, Mr. Reid now stands in line with

Owing to the base ingratitude of his con-
stituents, the S.A. politician who distributed
moleskin pants amongst a section of the electors,
and was triumphantly elected in 1890, stands a
big chance of being “left ” next year.
Dibbs’s Ministers were twice in a minority
last week on private members’ motions in N.S.W.
Assembly—once, in respect of savings-bank limits
to deposits and the creation of a State bank; and
again on the question of abolishing Civil Service
pensions.
The Code Napoleon is comprised in a
small volume which can easily be carried in the
waistcoat pocket. Griffith’s statutes alone fill
four huge volumes, to say nothing of such cherished
relics as the statutes of George IV. which Queens-
land took over at Separation.
One of the most melancholy sights ever
witnessed in N.S.W. Legislative Council was sup-
plied last week, when old Sir William Manning
stood up to dodder about the ghastly iniquity of
establishing true manhood suffrage, and to moon-
ingly plead the claims of a vote for “ thrift.”
Jacob, nominee M.L.C. (N.S.W.), says
“a seaman’s vote can be bought for a glass of
grog.” The birthrights of the world’s Esaus
have ever been bought for a mess of pottage.
But the Jacobs of the world should be content
with chiselling Esau. They needn’t “ rub it in.” *
Queensland Crown Law Office has ad-
vised Colonial Secretary Tozer that an aboriginal
who owns a 16-perch freehold is entitled to have
his name placed on the electoral-roll for the dis-
trict; while a half-caste standson the same footing
as a white. The next squatting game will be to
bestow titles of simh freeholds upon native niggers
and thus nobble the new votes. As for the half-
castes, they will ail naturally vote for their
“faders.”
One of the last shame-
less acts of the Griffilwraith
was to get Parliament
to vote £12,000 as an
“advance” to the Queens-
land Meat Export Co., in
which member after mem-
ber publicly admitted they
had personal pecuniary in-
terests !
Premier Shiels gener-
ously intimated that “it
would not be advisable to
make public the papers bear-
ing on the theft of the mace
from the Victorian Assem-
bly.” Not advisable in
the public interest, of course.
It would damage the confi-
dence of the British investor
to learn that the emblem of
the Speaker’s authority had
found its way into an assig-
nation-den.
Jack Murray, M.L. A.
for Warrnambool, threatens
to move “That, having re-
gard to the character of the
colony of Victoria, which is
being tarnished by the want
of action on the part of the
Government to bring alleged
offenders to justice, notably
in the case of Melbourne
directors of the Mercantile
Bank, this House is of
opinion that it is the im-
perative duty of the Attor-
ney-General ”to forthwith
cause to be investigated in
our criminal courts the
transactions of that bank.”
Nevertheless, The Bulletin
has a gloomy suspicion that
Mr. Murray’s motion will
never be moved, and that
in any case he wouldn’t find
10 just men to support it.
The House in general, not
the Government in particu-
lar, is responsible for the
scandalous security of Mat-
thew Davies and his “ ten-
tacles.” If Murray means
business, why doesn’t he call
a public meeting where all
Melbourne can howl its
indignation ? This question
applies equally to Ballarat
Vale, who has made one or
two feeble references to the
Davies scandal and been
peremptorily “shut up” by
Speaker Bent.
A certain N.S. Wales M.L.C. believes in
“a vote for thrift.” Of course he does. He is
credited with having, when a Minister of the
Crown with .£l5OO a year, lived on 30s. a week
for years. Very likely he’s still just as miserable
as ever. So far as “ thrift ” goes, he is entitled to
50 extra votes.
West Australia, with only one-twentieth
of N.S.W. population, has 655 miles of railway
open and 545 under construction; total, 1200
miles. N.S.W. has 2266 miles open, and 252
under construction ; total, 2518 miles. At the
end of ’9l W.A.’s population was 53,285; its
debt, £1,514,269, or £2B Bs. 4d. per head.
Pall Mall Gazette announces that
Parkes is to be raised to the peerage
“ Raised ” to the peerage ! Then to what degree
Abysmal in the people’s estimation
Is that poor creature sunk who needs to be
E’en derated to his deep damnation ?
Thus W. T. Carter, M.P. (once a Wes'
levan minister in S. A.) during the recent no-con-
fidenee debate in Victoria “ Just as God
Almighty has given the snake its fangs and poison-
bags, so He has given the Premier the power to
misrepresent and traduce members in endeavour-
ing to do them injury.”
Trickett, M.L.C. (N.S.W.) has an Ameri-
can friend with whom he was talking about vote-
registration. Said the Yank : “ Well, we can
get over that over there. We can generally turn
an election because we buy up 400 or 500 of these
registration-tickets. Of course we do not use
them, but still it prevents the other side trom
getting them.”
Griffith’s pet Constitution Bill won’t satisfy
the North Queenslanders. As for 20 years they
have agitated tor Home Rule, mere provincial
separation won’t satisfy them. In fact strong
pressure is being brought to bear on the new
Secretary of State, and it is probable that the
Kanakalanders will have autonomous control ot
N.Q. next year.
Agent-General Bray (he has been hyphen-
ated and is now known in England as Oox-Bray),
finding himself small potatoes in London, wants to
return to Adelaide; but the politicians who gave
him the post to get him out of the way will do'
nothing to relieve him of his duties. r lhey are
even prepared to be deaf to the inevitable plea,
when it comes along, that Lady Bray is losing her
health.
Macdonald’s demise took the kingbolt out
of Canadian loyalty. Only a day or two ago,
Montreal was stirred by a great public meeting,
which declared for Canadian Independence, while
U.S. Annexation came second, the status quo vyas
comparatively nowhere, and Imperial P ederation
nowherer. The Montreal Herald, the chier
local paper, persistently advocates Canadian
Independence.
The Foreign-traders of N.S.W. are per-
petually urging other people to go and settle on
the land, rather than attempt to create manu-
factures by means of Protection. Yet either the
Foreign-traders don’t settle on the land, or else
when they do they straightway abandon their
principles, for the N.S.W. agricultural districts
are the stronghold of Protection. What is the
meaning of this?
Pilcher, Q.C. (N.S.W.), “ cannot under-
stand the man who, by thrift and honest industry,
has acquired a little property for his family,
agreeing to a man who is here to-day and away to-
morrow, having exactly the same voice as himself
in legislating for the rights of property, and for
all the rights that men hold dear.” Meaning
thereby, that Pilcher, the over-protected lawyer,
can’t understand anyone being unselfish.
Premier Griffith (Q.), in face of his
announced retirement to the Bench, cabled the
Secretary of State that the Queensland Govern-
ment will re-introduce the discarded partition-
into-provinces Bill when the new Parliament
meets for its first session. As Griffith won tbe in
the new Parliament, how does he know this .
THE USE OF COLONIAL GOVERNORS.
1ST. OLD MAID: “I call Tabby darling, ‘Carrington’ because he
has such a neat moustache.”
2ND. DITTO: “I call my beauty, ‘Jersey’; he’s such a lovely
tortoise-shell.”
N.Q. Herald designates Sam’s cablegram “ a
shamefully dishonest one—a suppression of the
truth which is as utterly immoral as a deliberate
falsification of the facts would be.” The trick of
the political welsher.
A N.S.W. member of Parliament the
other day obtained the loan of a Government
steam-launch for a private picnic. While he had
the launch in use, the Government had to hire
another in its stead, for official work. Why,
when the member applied, didn’t the Treasurer
simply take £5 or £lO out of the Treasury till
and hand it to the applicant with— “ There you
are, dear boy ! go and buy yourself a steam-launch
for the day?” It would have amounted to the
same thing, and would have been a much simpler
and more candid operation.
A bitter and extremely bad-tempered
attack on the Melbourne Trades and Labour
Council, from the pen of Rudyard Kipling,
appeared in a recent Age. Nobody expects a red-
haired Jingo like Kipling to have any sympathy
with men who are dissatisfied with the Flag of
England, and other conventional rags and frippery
in which his idols are clothed. This young man
misunderstands his own drift. As a private indi-
vidual, he is an intense lover of constituted
authority and the mighty “ Isas a writer—
when not writing to order—unconsciously he
voices the sullen protestations of the herd against
privilege, usurpation, and tyranny.
The Australasian, in noticing a recent
very high shearing tally, argues from the
circumstance that shearers are too well paid.
The Australasian says nothing of the man
who only does his 30 sheep daily and who
would be absolutely starved out if the price per
hundred were reduced. Eighty per day per man
is a high average in any shed ; sixty, probably, is
nearer the average mark. But the Australasian
should be the last to denounce the high returns of
superior ability. Thus arguing, it reduces itself
below the standard of the “levellers” that it so
heartily condemns. The only valid argument for
individualism (it’s a subterfuge) is that it recog-
nises and recompenses superior ability.
If the Ballance (M.L.) Cabinet falls at
next election, it will be through the hostility of
the shop-keeping class. The Maoriland Govern-
ment has enacted that shop-assistants—about the
most hard-driven and underpaid class in the com-
munity—are in future to enjoy one half-holiday
per week, and now every grocer and bootmaker
from the North Gape to Stewart’s Island who
employs so much as one red-headed message-boy
has gone into opposition. Also, some of the ultra-
religious classes object to the innovation on the
ground that the Bible says : “ Six days shalt thou
labour,” and therefore the idea of labouring only
five and a-half days is “ unscreeptural,” and cal-
culated to bring down “ a judgment ” on the
country.
It is alleged against Premier Shiels, by
even his own Press patron (the Age) that “his
administration of the Attorney-General’s depart-
ment in the presence of the great banking scandals
which have demoralised the public conscience at
home, and damaged the fair name of the colony
abroad, has been certainly of the weakest, just
where weakness may be disaster. The part he
has played in refusing to appoint any Crown
officer to examine and report on alleged frauds
has been to undermine the respect for justice in
the public mind, and to apparently justify our
acrid critics in England in their assertions that
corruption runs through the whole body of the
state.” Clearly the time has arrived when Shiels
will have to throw his friends over, or be pushed
aside himself by the hand that made him.
AN ODE TO “BRITISH JUSTICE.”
“The spirit of British Justice”—five
words which will be met with in any three lines
of any speech by Jack Want, and in any 3| of any
speech by Parkes : —
It’s lauded by slave-swindling bankers,
By Shiels,
By Parkes, and the fee grabbing lawyer.
Loud peals
They ring out for the beauties of justice
Brand British,
And we writhe to our souls as they worship
Their fetish ;'
How many sleek scoundrels from skilly
It’s saved,
While the pauper’s black path to the gallows
It’s paved !
For that foul land has placed on this fair land
Her brand,
To save from Christ’s justice the strong one’s
’Curst band.
But w'eak ones and slaves would have justice
By rods ;
And the justice they want is not Britain’s,
But God’s.
There are various ways of conducting
public meetings. One—which is favoured by
King Hannell, of Newcastle, N.S.W. —has its
drawbacks. He puts the amendment, which is
an addition to the original motion, first; it is
carried. Then he puts the original motion, which
is naturally lost. Then he puts this lost motion
with the amendment tacked on. But he got home
all the same.
As the constant dropping of water will
wear away the hardest stone, so do the various
processes of life wear out the physical organism ;
every motion of a finger, every breath inhaled,
every thought conceived, and every word spoken
causes destruction of some of the complex
molecules which together form the human system.
This results in formation of a quantity of effete
matter called “ waste products,” which if retained
in the system give rise to various diseases. If
retained in the muscular tissue they cause rheu-
matism, gout, &c. ;in the lungs, consumption ; in
the blood, skin disease, boils, pimples, blotches,
and kidney disease?. The blood is purified and
impurities expelled by the various processes
of excretion, respiration, perspiration, micturation,
and defecation. Where these functions are not
properly performed such symptoms as headache,
nervousness, palpitation, vomiting, diarrhoea,
toothache, neuralgia, and constipation are
frequent, and must have immediate treatment, or
serious disease will undoubtedly set in. If the
first symptoms are attacked a cure is easy ; if
neglected a cure is sometimes impossible. If
Clements Tonic is faithfully used quick relief is
assured. This medicine quickly restores the
normal action to any weakened or impaired organ ;
it purifies and strengthens the blood, stimulates
the kidneys and liver, and relieves the bowels of
all impactions of faecal matter, and strengthens
the nervous system generally. Its value is proved
by such cases as that of J. S. M‘Arthur, Esq.,
Balmain, N.S.W., who writes:—“Feeling some-
what queer of late, I consulted a medical gentle-
man, who rather scared me by stating that my
case was a bad one. I was ordered to at once
knock off smoking, for one thing, and to be very
careful not to excite or overwork myself, &c.
Failing to obey any advice, and by not taking the
medicine ordered, nothing could stop me from
“topping my boom” and get through my last
watch, only to appear again in the shape of an old
albatross. ' Having strictly obeyed all orders, 1
could not discover any improvement, and at last
was advised to try Clements Tonic. After some
persuasion I did so, with the result—a new fellow
altogether, I have only used three bottles, and
shall never fail to carry a supply, and acquaint
my fellow shimnasters of the good I derived from
using Clements Tonic.”—l am, yours faithfully,
Jno. 8. M‘Arthur, Master C. & N. C. Co.’ s.s.

THE UNEMPLOYED AT BROKEN
HILL.
The Premier has received a communica-
tion from the Mayor of Broken-hill with
regard to the unemployed at that town. It
seems that the Mayor had written to the
I Railway Commissioners of South Australia
for free passes to enable the unemployed to
go to Petersburg, a town situated at the
junction of the main railways in Soulh
Australia. It is also the central point of the
northern agricultural district. The Railway
Commissioners recommended the Mayor to
communicate with the Premier of South
Australia on the subject. The Mayor there*
upon telegraphed to Sir George Dibbs about
the question. Sir George has sent a telegram
to Sir John Downer and ’told him thatrfie
hardly liked to make the request, but if the
South Australian Government would agree
to allow the unemployed to travel on the
South Australian railway at a reduced rate
to enable them to reach Petersburg, he (Sir
George) would authorise the police magis-
trate at Broken-hill to issue passes to those
of the men who desired to proceed to the

The latest Melbourne sensation was pro-
bably arranged by a clever pressman for the sixth
“ edeeshuns ”of the evening papers. First they
find the legs ; then the horror is allowed time to
properly soak into the public sensibilities. The
discovery of the arms follows, and the affair is
evidently to be “ continued in our next.”
* * #
At latest dates, Melbourne was anxiously
awaiting the discovery of a human head and
trunk, supposed to have been formerly connected
with the arms and legs now lying at the local
morgue. Also, a bevy of young reporters from
the Standard and Herald offices were on the
alert to prevent, if possible, the finding of both
these missing articles on the same day. Two
doses of gory horror have already been obtained
from one corpse, and even the “ great ” morning
dailies are praying silently that the balance of the
tragedy may be revealed in, at least, two pieces,
on separate occasions. In our mind’s eye,
Horatio, we see it announced, 18 months hence—
“ The Corpse Complete! Our own Special Cop
respondent stumbles across the Skull at Mid-
night.”
When “Billy” Smyth, of Sydney Customs,
was en tour on leave, he visited Balmoral and
prowled round the lodge entrance in the hope of
seeing Her Gracious. At last, he ventured to
ad Iress the red-headed potentate who was doing
se itry-go at the Castle gates: “Look here,
officer,” said William, “do you know whether I
shall be able to see Her Majesty the Queen pass
this way to-day ? ” “Noo, look-a-here,” said the
red-headed kiltie, “I have obsairved you prooling
aroond the premises a’ the morn, wi’ no vara guid
intent, I’ll warrant. So I tell ye to be off, and if
you’ll no be going, I’ll help you awa’ by
pitting an inch or twa o’ this skewer
intil ye.” “You bloodthirsty monster!”
roared Billy; “for two (Australian adjective)
pins, I’d swing you round by your (A. a.) kilt, and
bash your (A. a.) brains out against the (A. a.)
sentry-box.” Which so flurried the sentry that he
rang up the officer-of-the-guard, to whom the
wrathful William explained that, as a loyal sub-
ject, and a loyaller Customs-house officer, and as
a stranger from distant Australia, he was only
hovering around on the off-chance of getting a
sight of his Noble Queen. The officer expressed
his sorrow that the Queen wasn’t on tap that day,
and Billy wants to stuff his friends that the sentry
was taken off duty ! that the officer asked him to
have a drink, and that he had three!
* * *
Another and more recent Billy Smyth
story : He had just landed from his official gig at
Prince’s Stairs, Circular Quay, Sydney, when
there arrived at the steps a man-o’-war’s boat,
containing three naval officers in plain clothes.
Now, Billy had often been royally entertained
aboard these seadogs’ vessels, and his simple mind
utterly refuses to harbour any of the awful codes
of shore etiquette. So, directly he saw these
officers, one of whom was no less a personage than
His Excellency Admiral Lord Charles Scott, he
felt bound to extend shore hospitalities to them.
So he advanced cheerfully and, saluting his Nibs,
said : “ How do, Lord Charles? Will you join me
in a little refreshment?” The other two naval
officers lengthened their figureheads and changed
their masthead colours at this hideous act of
sacrilege on the part of the ingenuous William, but
the Admiral set things right at once by saying :
“ No, Mr. Smyth, I can’t take a drink, you know,
but I am sure B and S will ”
B and S being two slightly subor-
dinate naval swells. Billy, in afterwards narrat-
ing the incident, said, with a fine touch of
self-justification: “It wasn’t as if I was asking
him into a little back-slum pub., or a threepenny
bar; no, sir, I asked him into a first-rate hotel,
where they sold only sixpenny drinks !” Sweet
William!

Chief Justice Way went on circuit during
November and carefully carried his famous Pome-
ranian pup—-the gracious gift of Lady Kintore—
about with him in all his wanderings. It is stated
that it will shortly be gazetted as judge’s asso-
ciate.
# * *
At Burra (S.A.) railway station the other
day, an officious official bounced into Judge Way’s
carriage and ordered him to hand over the pup
hereinbeforementioned, to be sent in a separate
compartment. Whereupon, the Chief Justice
aforesaid handed over—his card ! and The
Bulletin blushes to state that the officious official
obsequiously apologised, instead of lifting the
pup by the scruff of its neck and dropping it into
the dog-truck.

The Parramatta (N.S.W.) parsons played
the “Comet in Andromeda” for all that it was
worth. “Who knows what may happen within
the next 24 hours?” shrieked one apostle, as he
told his awed audience that Comet Biela was
FRIENDS IN NEED.
1ST. MELBOURNE MAN: “For Heaven’s sake lend us something; the bailiffs are in my

2ND. DITTO: “ Most extraordinary coincidence! They’re in mine, too!”

The most damning allegation against Pastor
Abbott, the principal in the newest religious
scandal at Fitzroy, Melb., is that he permitted
the lady who boarded at his Faith-healing Home,
Bethshan - and who used to perch on his knee and
kiss him before and after meals —to mend his
trousers. The wife who will tamely submit to
the indignity of seeing another woman mending
her hubby’s pants —for kindness —in her own
home has not yet arrived. Pastor Abbott in
proof of the purity of his motives pointed out that

Only a score of so of S.A. legislators
(including the Adelaide Club contingent, the
Speaker and the Ministers) accepted Governor
Kintore’s last invitation to dine at Government

Milord used to let his aide-de-camp and other

The Aileshury baccarat case reminds a
correspondent of an affair which occurred some
years ago in Sydney when Mr. Alec. Finlay, then
in his heyday as a sportsman, lost over £2OOO to a
betting man named Clark, at tossing, in Emer-
son’s oyster-shop, and gave a cheque for the
amount. This did not suit Clark, who wanted
to know if the cheque was good. He didn’t want
no cheques off no one ; he had won his (Austra-
lian adjective) money, and he must have cash.
Joe and Barney Thompson and Bill Branch, who
were present, then offered Clark £lso'o for the
cheque, which he took. Finlay wanted to stop the
cheque, on the ground that he had been rooked,
but he eventually paid it, being advised to
do so by Mr. Herbert Power and others
who were present and saw the whole busi-
ness, which was, for a wonder, quits straight.
Clark played fair and wanted to leave off but
Finlay refused.

The private detective business hasn’t been
prosperous of late in N.S. Wales. The private
detective is usually a weedy little man dressed in
A MELBOURNE MYSTERY.
With bated breath the poet
To speak about a pair of legs,
The which a “ peeler,” prowling round,
Tied neatly in a parcel, found.
Now, where can be the ownah ?
The question of their age and sex
Enquiring minds appears to vex ;
Some said they graced a body male,
While others tell a touching tale
And vow a little donah,
Deprived of means to walk abroad,
Would like to have her shanks restored—
Wethinks we hear her weeping.
Who ran those limbs (Ah ! there's the rub)
That occupy a pickle-tub
In calm official keeping.
As certain as that eggs are eggs
The p’leeoe have copped two naked legs.
A person has been cut in halves ;
The outline of the famous calves
Suggests a dainty charmer,
And so some critics seem afraid
That probably a chorus-maid
Displayed them many times and oft,
To paralyse the chappies soft
Who love the lyric drama.
But why indulge in guesses vain ?
One awful fact alone is plain :
A man or girl ; alive or dead—
Matilda, Charley, Maud, or Fred—
Has had ’em amputated.
And since there’s not a creature who
Will come and claim the missing two,
The bard would modestly suggest
’Twere well to lay those legs at rest,
Or let them be cremated.
ENOUGH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are joys enough in this world of ours,
Though Fortune gives them not to all;
Crave ne’er to drink till the nectar sours,
Nor to feast on foods which a fool devours
Till the flavours on his palate pall.
When legs are strong, and pockets light,
A journey long o’er country rough
Has its wayside pleasures, and you’re all right—
Quite happy enough,
Not too happy, but happy enough.
When the autumn mists your ardour damp,
That onetime used to kindle soon,
Your legs may not be asked to tramp
So far and oft; perhaps in camp
You’ll sip your soup from silver spoon.
And the baldhead knows the mental ease
That comes to men who’ve made their “stuff”:
He mourns the loss of his youth, yet he’s
Quite happy enough—
Not too happy, but happy enough.
Poor Sarah Makin scarcely dreams
Of righteous treatment here,
For justice is not what it seems
In this polluted sphere.
She hasn’t faith in human love ;
The lady looks afar,
And puts her trust in One Above—
Where all the children are.
The babies warble hymns of praise
To Sarah’s solid worth ;
They sing about her tender ways
When they were yet on earth.
The Lord who rules that Higher Court
Has heard the evidence,
And read His servant’s soul—in short.
He knows her innocence.
If angels for weak mortals plead,
Preserving them from harm,
It must he very good, indeed.
To run a bahy-farm ;
For, as the cherubs quit the same,
They spread their tiny wings
And bless the thrifty farmer’s namo
Before the King of Kings.

a second-hand suit, dyed black, so that a cloud of
steam rises from him when he stands near a fire;
and the person he gets in trouble with is generally
the big and bullocky co-respondent, whose size
has led to the respondent’s undoing. In a recent
divorce-case the usual flabby little spy was hired
to obtain evidence for the plaintiff. He didn’t
get sufficient evidence, and the plaintiff used
unfriendly language while paying the bill. Then
the detective called round on the co-respondent
and offered, for a consideration, to give information
about how the perjury was got up on the other
side, and next instant there was a sound like
someone breaking open a melon with a bootjack,
and a partially-stunned private inquiry agent,
with a red stream flowing from his nose, was
sitting on the floor, and remarking faintly that a
man didn’t ought to be hit when he was down.
Another inquiry gentleman had an even worse
experience. He was employed by a publican’s
jealous wife to obtain evidence against
the old beer-seller sufficient to ensure a divorce,
and so he got himself up in what he thought was
an elaborate disguise and went out to live in the
hotel. Probably the disguise wasn’t so good as
he imagined, for the publican recognised him at
one try. He got no evidence, but he became the
bosom friend ot the landlord and spent over £3O
in standing drinks, and when even this failed to
evoke any information he attempted to introduce
some ladies of dubious repute to his new friend,
and then the beer-merchant knocked his head
hard against the floor .and put him out. The next
trouble was that the wife repudiated his bill, as
there were no results to show for the money
except a swollen head and a disordered liver; and
the final difficulty arose when the detective went
back to his assailant and offered to supply him,
for a small consideration, with evidence of adultery
against the wife, whereupon the enraged publican
took him across his knee, and, partially suiting the
action to the word, said he had a good mind to snap
his vertebrae for him. If this sort of thing spreads
there will be an end to the private-detective busi-
ness. The one fixed rule of ninety-nine|hundredths
of the trade is always to sell the plaintiff to the
respondent, and the respondent to the plaintiff,
and then to blackmail the co-respondent; but if
the parties won’t buy each other the sale must fall
through, and when they batter the detective as
well the last vestige of profit goes out of the
business.

The “change” trick, as run at Dubbo,
N.S.W. Decent-looking fellow buys from a

“’Ullo ! wot’s this ? Gave yer ’arf-a-suvrin, did

The half-sovereign is handed to him, “ ’Ere, tell
yer wot, I might mistake this for a sixpence,
Ere’s sixpence more, sixpence and nineteen-and-
six is a pound ; gimme a note instead of this ere
change.” Chemist complies, and stranger exits
hurriedly. The arithmetical facts of the case
don’t strike the chemist for at least ten minutes.

A father advertises in a daily for his son,
who, in 1878, was “at Sydney, in the banking-
trade.” The old man is (naturally) “ anxious to
hear.” Nothing but the plaintive wail of the

“Even the newspapers that support the
Gladstone Government condemn, in the most
sweeping manner, the unfairness shown by Mr.
Justice Matthew,”— (Argus cable.)—
The Maori language is a curious one,
depending largely on almost imperceptible inflec-
tions which the foreigner never altogether manages
to grasp. You may get up an elaborate compli-
ment in Maori setting forth that the recipient’s
eyes are like stars shining on the sea, and that you
want to fly with her to some verdant isle in a
region of eternal summer, and then you somehow
get just one accent wrong, and you tell that girl
with a smiling countenance that her uncle was
hanged for shoving a baby up a drain. A British
dude, who lately visited a native settlement, got
into trouble thus : He had formulated an expen-
sive and beautiful phrase by means of a dictionary
and a half-caste acquaintance, but it went wrong
somewhere or other, and when he bestowed it on
a native lady her friends cut off his retreat to the
steamer and chased him most of the way back to
the city by road.

In Auckland (M.L.) you can now buy
false teeth on time-payment. You give the
dentist a mortgage on the teeth to secure pay-

smith tries to seize them for non-payment you
close your mouth and tell him through your nose
to take them at his own risk. He can’t get them
without an aggravated assault, and that means
damages.

In a N.Q. township
two youngsters were
haled before the magis-
trates (two big cattle-
raisers and a farmer) for
illegally pounding two
calves. The boys pleaded
guilty. The c a 111 e-
raisers were for the maxi-
mum penalty, £5O each
or six months’ hard.
The farmer asked for
leniency, urging their
youth, first offence, &0.,
but without avail. He
then asked the C.P.S. to
produce the record of
the last conviction for
a similar offence, saying
with emphasis : “It was
in March, 1888.” One
of thecattle-raiserslooked
amazed and then hur-
riedly said: “Ail right
—l’ll consent to a £5
fine,” and so it was de-
cided. Afterwards an
inquisitive vagabcnl
looked up that 1888 case
and found that the far-
mer was the prosecutor,
the cattle-raiser the cul-
prit—and the fine £5.
Such are the amenities of
the honorary magistrate
system !

A church bazaar, going on in a Melbourne
suburb, is to pay for the parson’s pleasure trip to
England.
One of the horrors of the Civil Service is
the men who are always waiting with a gruesome
yearning for the dead men’s shoes of their
superiors. One of the big Government depart-
ments in Maoriland is a case in point. The per-
manent head of one branch is very old, and must
either die or retire ere long. The next man, the
one who should inherit the billet, has heart-
disease ; he may last 20 years or he may crumble
away at any moment. The third one on the list
has had sundry fits, and suffers from partial
paralysis, and there is a general impression that
the next seizure will prove fatal. These two
individuals spend most of their time watching the
boss and each other. It is a race between them—
or rather a race between the one’s diseased heart
and the other’s inevitable fit—for the old man’s
place. The rest of the staff is watching the three
of them, for when they all go off there will be
promotion all round. If a mad bull could be
induced to burst into the office, in all probability
the aged chief would flicker out right there from
nervous shock, and the second man’s diseased
heart would stop, and the third would have his
last fit on the floor at the same moment, and then
there would be jubilation among the staff. It is a
horrible thing when everybody in a big office is
waiting for somebody to die.

finding that her sister was very fond of him, broke

eventually married the sister. She soon died,
however, and when her sister returned he married
her. The idea of a girl leaving her lover to give
her sister a chance is very pretty, but not original.

“Anton Brunet” (Star River, N.Q.): (1) Hrs he got

born in British territory, and not formally registered at

if born in the Crimea, the same claim would probably also
hold good. (3) No; the mere acceptance of a Queens-
land land-order does not confer naturalisation. (4) The

RABBIT EXTIRPATION.
FELTON, GRIM WADE, k Go’s
Patent Phosphorised Wheat.
As the season for vigorous action for the ex-
tirpation of the Rabbit Pest is now approaching,
the manufacturers desire to call the attention of
station-owners and managers to the latest ex-
pression of opinion they have received as to the
efficacy of their
PATENT PHOSPHORISED WHEAT
in the
DESTRUCTION of RABBITS.
“ To Messrs. Felton, Grimwade, and Co.,
Melbourne.
Dear Sirs, —
“ I am laying the Patent Phosphorised
Wheat now, and have better grass than
any in the district, still the rabbits will
take it in preference to the grass.
“ I cannot speak too highly of the wheat,
and have used it this last three seasons.
Last year I. did more with four bushels
than 1 did by the expenditure of ,£2OO in
carbon bisulph. and digging out. To
quote a neighbour’s opinion, it would be
cheap at a pound a bushel. I have given
samples to a number of persons in this
district, who will use it this coming
season.
“To conclude, there is only one way to
deal with the rabbit plague—by poison ;
all the exterminators and quack patents in
the colony, among which may be included
carbon bisulph., are not worth the tins or
oases they are forwarded in. The reason
is obvious—the time required and cost.
“The use of your wheat should be made
compulsory by Government, and the
rabbits would vanish.
“ Yours truly,
(Signed) “E. C. PETTCH,
“ Warra Warra,
“ Via Stawell.
“14/11/92.”
We Claim for Our
PATENT PHOSPHORISED WHEAT;
That it is Highly Poisonous.— By our pro-
cess of Manufacture it is impossible for one grain
to receive more phosphorous than another. Per-
fect uniformity of strength is thus attained!
Rabbits Eat it Greedily, as by this Patent
Process the wheat is made highly palatable.
Durability.— Each grain being encased in a
transparent and impervious envelope, it stands
exposure to the weather almost any length of time
without lessening its poisonous quality.
No Danger of Pii’e. —Careful experiments have
been made with wheat phosphorised to SIX
TIMES the strength of our wheat, and it could
not be made to fire.

PAUL MELL.
Two mates were travelling through Queens-
land with pigs. Near a township, one said he’d
go in for an hour or so. Three or four hours
passed and there was no sign of his return.
Securing the pigs as best he could, the second man
started in to find his mate. At the first pub., in
answer to a question, the barmaid said : “ Oh,
yes, I know. You’re looking for the man with
the pigs.” “No, miss, I’m seeking the man who
ought to be with the pigs, but isn’t.” Which
over-smartness lost him, at least a finger of
whisky in his next nobbier.
Cairns Post takes a well-deserved “rise ”
out of an “affecting ” paragraph as follows which
lately appeared in a Sydney paper concerning that
well-advertised person, Pastor Gribble, the N.Q.
aboriginal missionary
Among the visitors of the Cairns Hospital came some of
the natives from the mission station, and a friend writes
of a very touching picture, one worthy of the shill of a
great artist: Mr. Gribble, sick in hod, propped up with
pillows, around the bed are gathered the blacks, the mis-
sionary is telling the old story of Christ’s love, and with
voice scarce above a whisper, broken by coughs, the oft-
told story is listened to with interest.
Broken by coughs! It makes us cough. The
latest Gribble advt. is contained in a wire to the
Sydney dadies that Gribble, jun., has only escaped
being eaten by three alligators through his prowess
as a swimmer.
Dear Bulletin, —Queensland has achieved
the honour of adding a new word, “swindlecate,”
to the English language. There are features
in the artistic jobs of our swindlecators, such,
for instance, ns the preference shares system,
which will well repay the study of artists in other
countries. The promoters of each land-grant
railway swindlecate usually receive one, or more,
preference shares, according to the service they
are able to render as legislators, or financiers, in
procuring the concession. Some consideration
must be paid for every share by law ; the price is,
therefore, fixed at =£l. A Queensland legislator
may not possess so much as one sov. in hard cash
at any one time, but his P.N. secured on his next
month’s salary would probably be accepted for
this sum. Extraordinary privileges are heaped on
these preference shares by the articles of associa-
tion. For example, in the Kimber agreement
for constructing the transcontinental railway, pro-
vision was made for forty preference shares, to
which was assigned one-fourth of the net profits.
George King, M.L.C., of Gowrie, stated in the
Legislative Council that the value of these shares
could not be assessed at less than .£60,000. The
inducement to the English capitalist is un-
doubtedly the acquisition of estates the size of
principalities which, exploited by slave-labour, will
yield princely revenues to himself and his heirs
through many generations. His aim is as old as
history itself - the large estates and slave-labour,
the latifundia and ergastulum of ancient Rome.
The inducement to the bankrupt and needy poli-
tician is the preference share, entitled to huge
profits extending over year's, which can be dis-
counted for a large sum in hard cash before
even a pick is put in the sod. Strange to
say, a careful study of the Act reveals thejfact that
swindles of even greater magnitude are pos-
sible. If these loopholes for fraud have been
left unintentionally, those most interested
will doubtless thank The. Bulletin for the follow-
ing wrinkle. The amount of land granted will be
in proportion to the cost of construction. The
land is valued at from one-fourth to one-eighth
its fair market-value. For instance, the projected
land-grant railway from Croydon to Granite
Creek via Herberton passes all the way through
perhaps the richest belt of mineral land in the
world. According to the Act this land may be —
and, of course, will be—valued at half-a-crown an
acre. Hence it follows that it is the interest of
the English company to which the concession is
sold to accept the highest and not the lowest
tender for constructing the railway. The higher
the tender the higher their ultimate profits. Into
whose maw will the stupendous profits made from
the railway contracts, let under this iniquitous
system, fall? There is absolutely no obstacle
to the following colossal job being success-
fully carried out. The small knot of hungry
politicians and bank managers who secure the
concession can float it in London for half
cash and half scrip. Their holding would
ba large enough to make a tool of the London
board. They could then re-form themselves into
a co npany of railway contractors and frame their
tender so as to yield themselves a colossal profit.
Their representatives on the Board would secure
its accept mce. The line before-mentioned is 350
miles long, and a moderate profit of .£lOOO per
mile spells ,£350, 00P in all. That some such
course was contemplated is evident to me from
the following facts. The Act expressly stipulates
that the company is not bound to adopt the
shortest route ((ho Government refused repeatedly
to survey the route beforehand) —the company is
not bound to disclose, the amount of the lowest
tender. The inference is obvious : the longer the
route the greater the prospective value of the
land-grab, the greater the present value of the
preference shares ; and last, but not least, the
greater the profits arising from the railway con-
tracts. Poor Queensland ! — Alario.

FUNNY IRISH BLUNDERS.
The native of the Gi’een Isle who said, “It’s
a great comfort to be left alone when your
sweetheart is with you,” and the Irish auctioneer
who, while praising some goods he was offering
for sale, exclaimed, “These are just the things I
should like to buy for my wife if she were a
widow,” made very witty bulls. Equally good,
but even more complicated, was that perpetrated
by the exile in America, who pathetically ex-
pressed himself thus ; “Sure an’ if I live till I die,
an’ God knows whether I will or not, I’ll visit
ould Oireland afore I lave Philadelfy.” A funnier
blunder still, was that made by a new-chum
Hibernian, who was a passenger by the Southern
Express the other night. He alighted, with other
thirsty souls, at Mittagong, but lingered at the
bar, over his favourite nectar, longer than he
should, and only regained the platform in time to
see the tail-lights of the train by which he intended
to have journeyed, receding from his view. For
a moment lie was dumb with astonishment, and
then collecting all the energy and presence of
mind he was capable of exerting, he cried, “Hould
on there, ye blatherin’ engine ; faix, there’s a man
on board oi ye that’s left behind!” These
stories have all the true Irish ring about
them, and call up memories of the Irishman
who complained to his physician that he
“gave him so many drugs he was sick a long
time after he got well.” No one who has used
St. Jacobs Oil can make a similar complaint to
that; it never causes a man to “feel sick after he
is well.” St. Jacobs Oil is an external remedy
for the absolute cure of pain, and it leaves no ill
effects behind. After using it the rheumatic
patient leaves his bed, or throws away his crutches
and begins life again a new man. Hear what Mr.
F. W. Kirby, of Mort-street, Balmain, says about
it: — “I use St. Jacobs Oil for rheumatism, and
do not know what I should do without it. The
kind of work I am engaged in compels me to be
out in all weathers, and I often have to remain in
wet clothes for hours together. The result is that
I get rheumatism badly in my back at times. I
find there is nothing equal to St. Jacobs Oil for
shifting it, and putting me all right again. Both
my wife and I look upon it as a real blessing.”
The voluntary testimony of thousands of such
witnesses proves that this marvellous remedy
possesses the confidence of all classes of the
community.

themselves, often in letters of blood, amid the
half-unknown mysterious regions of tropical Aus-

i'be Rutlisobild delegate to the Silver Confer-
ence warns the world that unless something be done to
give silver a fictitious value, the metal is hound to come
down to 2s. 9d. an oz., and possibly Is. 9J., and his only
remedy is to keep it up to 3s. 7d. at a cost of millions a
year to the participating nations. You might as we.l try
to give an artificial value to pigs’ feet. How he proposes
to meet the panic that would he bound to follow at the
end of the five years, the cable sayeth not. The result of
this conference will sound the death-knell of many an
Australian silver-mine.

They are saying now, in one of the Australias,
that when a money-lender with a Hebraic name is suing

have nine Cohens on the Jewry, especially when the

The shares of the Amana Co., Lucknow, N.S.
Wales, were, it is cabled, over-applied for, and the floating
of other blocks is foreshadowed. It seems impossible for
the English people to let well alone. The Wentworth
property consists of some thousand acres, so that it the
British public are madly anxious for speculation there, we
can quite anticipate their anxiety being appeased. And
after that the deluge.

Alves’ wire-cloth ore-concentrator, cheap, effec-
tive, and simple, promises to fill a big breach in the
mining industry. The Alves’ effectiveness largely depends
on the use of a finely-meshed wire cloth placed on a
rubber bed. It is claimed that by their use mercury in
the stamper-boxes can be dispensed with as well as copper
plates, the free gold being saved in the lockers with
which Hie concentrator is provided, and that the rotary
action of the sand against the meshes has the effect of
concentrating all the minerals, and that these can be
separated by grading different tables. Splendid results
of working are shown. Whether so cheap and simple a
machine, requiring no motive power, will do all that is
said of Alves’, the writer hopes soon to have an oppor-
tunity of definitely ascertaining.

Not very long ago, when the expiring flickers of
the paralysed silver-boom went guttering out, that zigzag
journal, Sydney D.T., went baldheaded for a gold-boom,
prophesied it, hoped for it, advocated it, and crusaded it
as the one hope of Australia’s sudden salvation. Last
week it had an editorial anathema on “ The Gold Mania,”
in which it cursed the greed that followed the “ phantom
finger” of the gold fiend. Backslithersomeness, thy name

The rains, whicli have been abundant through-
out N.S.W. this year, have enabled the Golden Terrace
Co. to sluice almost continuously, although it is intended
to erect a dam at the head to conserve water in dry
weather. A# they get well into the gravel (hr yields
improve. They are now going upwards of 2s. to the
cubic yard. From the quantity of tailings already
accumulated near the river, we are afraid the “get
away ” will be their greatest trouble, and that ere long
they will have to await a fresh in the river to carry off
their rubbish.

A party of prospectors from N.S.W. have spent
some £2OO in trying to find an alluvial lead at Myer’s Flat,
near Eaglehavvli, Vic. If a lead of that kind had existed
there it surely would have been found long ago, when a
big rush took place at the Flat. The writer, then work-
ing in the vicinity, got there early on the morning of the
day following the striking of rich gold by the prospectors.
Wiiut might have been ! There were shanties, billiard-
saloons, and any number of stores erected, and at one
time 0000 men camped there. It was a rank duffer, and,
therefore, short-lived. Within a year there was nothing
of it left but thousands of shallow-holes.

The work of bringing water on to another
Shoalhaven sluicing property has commenced. The show
is at Bungonia, and consists of several hundreds of acres
with a tremendous fall into the river. The scheme is a
gravitation one and will cost some £20,000. Victorian
men, including Wallace, Syme and Jessop, are providing
the coin, and the management has been entrusted to Mr.
W. M‘Gregor, who is the principal vendor, and whose
faith in the field is firm. The property, like many another
near the river, was worked by diggers in former years in
a primitive way. In one part they used dry-blowers, and
there are numerous other signs that when the giant
nozzle is brought to play it will turn out big dividends.

Editor Bulletin, —This is the busiest season of
the year in N.S.W., yet trade is bad, money tight, labour
unemployed. What will it be in the winter, what is the
outlook, what the remedy ? An Act to permit mining on

Dear Bulletin, —I, a novice, want to keep the
report of a certain court-case out of the Sydney daily
papers. Can you tell me how it is to be done? That it
can be done is quite evident from what has occurred re
two oases heard in Sydney District Court on 25th ult.—
Sheerin v. Equitable Life Assurance Co., and Hennessy v.
the same. Defendants applied to the Judge to stop the
case being reported in the newspapers, but this applica-
tion was refused, yet although the case was opened and
then postponed to the following day, not a line ever
appeared in the dailies! I should have thought that the
fact of an application to stop newspapers reporting having
been refused by the Judge would only have made the
journals keener.—Sub.

The recent returns from the Rockdale freehold

A Croydon miner writes of a place within ten
miles of a railway-station—an old alluvial field where
there is a hill entirely composed of alluvial wash contain-
ing gold from the grass-roots down to the bottom. His
lowest computation of the wash is Idwt. to the load, and
there are hundreds of thousands of loads available. He
adds that there is a river at the foot of the hill. He wants
to know if there are any moneyed men in Sydney prepared
for such a spec. It would be hard to find them just now.
A big revival in gold mining by reason of the inaugura-
tion of hydraulic sluicing has been here foreshadowed. It
will take time and money, hut it is coming as sure as to-
morrow’s sun, and our advice to the Croydon miner is to
wait and watch his opportunity.

It looks as if the Baker’s Creek Co. will this
time pot one or more men for gold-stealing, by reason of
one man turning Queen’s evidence. Gold-thieves at this
mine have long been suspected. As long as they confined
their attention to the ore in the mine all efforts to catch
lh‘iii have been futile; but to steal amalgam from the
battery, without detection, is not so easy, and (hinging
of miners’ clothes is advised, altho’, in a mine like Baker’s
Creek, the system would he practically useless because of
the number of the openings to the surface.

Another new explosive is to the fore —“ Storite”
—the tests (f which, on the Barrier, are described as
wonderful. We have heard of a hundred new things since
the introduction of dynamite which, for general use, still
remains king. Even one (including dynamite when first
introduced) had i.o “ noxious fumes,” and as the trials
were always made in the open air none were detected ;
but when the time came to try them in a hot cross-cut or
rise it was often found that awful brain • lank (what
hideous headaches and heart-pa’pitation are the result of
breathing dynamite-fumes 1) was their distinguishing
characteristic. More miners have been slowly done to
death by the fumes of explosives than killed by explo-
sions. The man who invents : n explouve more powerful
and cheaper than dynamite without noxious fumes will
deservedly become a millionaire.

ship. In the “ Any Revolver Match,” Jack scored 41 out
of a possible 42. His six shots at 25yds. range were so
close together that a half-crown would have covered all
the marks. The shot that scored only 6 was just outside
the edge of the bull’s-eye. Hamilton is a fine specimen
of a well-preserved Victorian native. A score of years
ago, at the outbreak of the Palmer (N.Q.) gold-rush, he
was conspicuously the “best man” among some ten
thousand ; before that his feats on Gympie (S.Q.) were
phenomenal for single-handed pluck ; and it may be that,
even now, he would prove the best of any scratch ten

HER PORTRAIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Her hair, smooth and brown as the fur on the crook
Of the frond of a fern-tree, is soft as her eyes,
So liquidly bright with their innocent look
Of courteous enquiry or tranquil surprise.
She comes of high race, she is one of the daughters
Of a sire with a pedigree long as an earl ;
Her fine sloping shoulders, small head, and great quarters,
Stay—l’d better explain that “ she ” isn’t a girl.
No such luck: she’s a mare-could I only discover
A girl as kind, faithful, and bonny as she.
With sufficient good taste to take me for her lover,
I should not a lonely old bachelor he.
No bother to catch her, she looks on as idle
All dodgy endeavours from duty to sneak ;
She’ll put down her head while you slip on the bridle,
And rub all your shirt-buttons off with hef cheek.
She’s good on the ranges—no charger more steady—
Dowm a steep, greasy spur she will skid like a cat ;
For a jump or a scramble she always is ready.
But likes herself best on the beach or the flat.
She’ll sniff at the crossings and snort in the river,
When the bit is awash and the saddle afloat;
She’ll breast the strong current with ears all a-quiver,
And up the far bank she will spring like a goat.
Many a long day yet I hope to be carried
Scrambles and gallops on ridges or plain,
And should I some day have the luck to get married,
When my youngsters ride her’s I shall live then again
Gisborne, Oct. 23.
WAIHOA.
Testimonial Sweaters.
It is just about time that the testimonial-to-tho
esteemed-and-beloved-employer nuisance were
knocked on the head, and The Bulletin means to
do it, if constant hammering will accomplish the
fell deed. The thing is becoming a perfect scandal,
and will, if not checked, be worked into a highly-
valued branch of the art of sweating. It is quite ill
enough for the maintenance of manly independence
that any handful of men should bu in a position to
dole out employment—in other words, the right
to work—to their fellow-men. That fact alone
tends to the encouragement of servility. Mechani-
cal operatives have, so far, preserved their inde-
pendence of manner and of spirit less impaired
than any other class. But that is not because
they are a superior race, but merely because in
their occupations, to become competent in which
a special early training is requisite l , competition is
less severe than in some other occupations. The
common clerk—-the wretch who can only read and
write and cipher—is the most helpless and, conse-
quently, the most servile creature upon earth.
He is reared and trained in an atmosphere
of adulation and docility. He is taught
things by contraries, and every influence
presses upon him to shape his ideas to the
impression that all self-respecting men should
study to crawl with ease and grace. Only in
presence of inferiors is it proper to stand erect.
Not to bend the knee and the back before a
“ superior is an indication of ill-breeding.
# » *
When an employer of genteel slaves makes the
mistake of addressing, with the polite insolence of
manner which they are accustomed to, some
casually employed mechanic, it frequently happens
that the base mechanical person is instantly
stirred to surprised resentment, and tells the
tweed-snited tyrant to “go to hell,” or words to
similar effect. The clerk hears, trembles, wonders
and—pities the vulgarity and ignorance of the
follow. The tame man has been trained to such a
pitch of docility that he doesn't even envy the
freedom of the untamed man. Habit, surround-
ings, necessity, and example make of half our
young men moral geldings ; all the fire and man-
hood have gone out of them. They are content
to cringe that they may exist, and natural talent
is stifled and lost unless it be a talent fur syco-
phancy, in which case there is a chance, of promo-
tion, and, perhaps, emancipation and fortune.
* # #
It is almost invariably an individual so gifted
who sets in motion the scheme of a presentation
to an employer. Now, there is no sincerity in the
thing—as regards the employer. It is a dismal
effect of the existing system of society that
friendship or trust between employer and em-
ploye is almost entirely impossible. The better
able the employer may be to deal handsomely
with his employes, the less chance is thereof their
retaining any good will towards him. Every
salaried man in this world considers himself
underpaid. We defy anyone to find us a man
who does not regard himself as “entitled to an
increase.” Again, no man is totally without gall.
The obligation under which a servant is, of agree-
ing with his master’s sentiments, of testifying
towards him an admirable deference and regard,
of submitting to and even seeming to invite his
assumptions of all-round superiority, creates—
must create —reaction. The testimonial-promotor
does not least dislike the employer. It is not
affection which actuates him. It is self-interest.
The employer’s favour is necessary fur him : he is
cleverer than his fellows in matters of intrigue.
He will squeeze money from them to buy advance-
ment for himself, or, if not advancement, consoli-
dation of his position,
# # *
In respect of such matters the employer or
other influential person is nearly always imbecile.
He has found that his presence is greeted with
amiable respect; his conversation (when he has
deigned to address it to his servants) has been
received with gratification ; his views have been
endorsed with admiration for the intelligence
which framed them; his wishes have been
studied and often anticipated. He believes himself
beloved. The artful schemer plays on him as if he
were an organ. The trickster heads a subscription-
list handsomely—out of proportion to his salary,
indeed —and takes it round among his fellow-
slaves. The thing is inevitably complete as soon
as commenced. Who dare refuse to contribute ?
Who dare venture to be mean where economy may
involve him ? The promoter collects a handsome
sum, and devotes a proportion of it to getting a
long and abject lie engraved on plate or endorsed
in vellum, stating to the master how admirable,
how virtuous, how talented he is—not. This im-
partial and disinterested effusion from persons
whom he could plunge into penury next day, if ho
didn’t like the turn of an eyebrow, the expression
of an eye, the way the face was shaved, or the cut
of the coat worn, the employer modestly receives
and places prominently on his sideboard or hangs
on his wall. And the schemer who got up the
testimonial rests in mind as a deserving, trust-
worthy, and devoted soul, upon whom the broken-
meats of fortune will not be thrown away. The
miserables who contributed because they daren’t
do otherwise have converted the promoter’s
wisely-invested fiver into two hundred pounds’
worth of plate, and while they are too many and
too insignificant to bo borne in mind, baby has
gone without new boots, the wife has done with
last year’s bonnet again, every member of the
family has been deprived of something because
Mr. M ‘Sycophant had hit upon the idea that the
wedding of young Middlegilt furnished'a fine
occasion for advertising his devotion, at the
expense of the fools in the office.

solemnly and sincerely declare as follows ;
Whereas, I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that
I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried several
Doctors and many Remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas,
I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Bassmnsseu’s
PURELY HERBAL “UNIVERSAL ALFALINE
PILLS,” which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare
COMPLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago, I have remained well ever
since.
THE ALFALINE PILLS also cured my wife, and I make
this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to
be true.
Subscribed and declared at Sydney, this 23rd day of
November, 1891, before me,
Also witnessed by A. Baly, Esq., a Commissioner oi the
Supreme Court of New South Wales and Victoria.
To Herr Rassmussen.—l have much pleasure to inform you
that your wonderful Herbal Remedies cured me of a most
obstinate case of Nervousness of 22 years’ standing, after

always feel grateful to you, and will always recommend your
remedies to my friends, and I am willing at any time to
be interviewed by any person who doubts this Testimonial. —

well-known Herbal Remedies have been the means of per-

mentary Testimonials which he has received certifying to
important cures effected by his remedies.” —Sydney Evening
News.

Remedies by thousands, has already acquired an Australian

"OH DON’T TOUCH ME! DON’T COME
NEAR ME!”
These words were uttered with a howl—almost a
yell. Yet the boy to whom they were addressed
wasn’t within 10 feet of the howler, and wouldn’t
have come closer for his life. The scene was a big
business office in New York, and the howler was
the chief man in it. He owned the concern, and
was very rich, and a decent fellow enough. But
sometimes he would break out like that, and howl
as though he had just discovered a fire in a
powder-mill. You could hear him from the base-
ment to the roof. What was the matter with
him? Temporary insanity ? Not quite, but some-
thing nearly as bad. He had an acute attack of
gout in his toe, and at those solemn crises he
couldn’t bear the sight of even a shadow moving
in his direction. Ask somebody who has the gout
how it feels. Fancy a blacksmith twisting your
toe with hot pincers while a shoemaker is thrust-
ing a bradawl through your knee-joint. That’s a
■little like it.
Well, there are things not so bad as gout, yet
they make us touchy enough. Here comes a man,
for instance, who says, “Everything now was a
trouble to me.” What should he talk that way
for ? Why should everything have been a trouble
to him? There is an old saying that while we
can’t keep the crows from flying, we needn’t let
them make nests in our hair. That’s good sense.
But it’s easy to give advice and to quote proverbs.
How does a person act who suffers from boils ?
Now, the foundation of all feeling and pain is
the nerves. An hour or two of toothache is a
lesson on the nervous system. But there are
diseases (or one disease anyhow) in which all the
nerves in the body seem to tingle to every sight
and sound. The mind is on the look-out for evil
—the man is depressed and afraid. Every word
means mischief, and every bush hides an enemy.
So he thinks. He knows what Solomon meant
when he said, “ The grasshopper is a burden.”
Mr. Michael McCormack is a railway messenger
and lives in Mullingar, County Westmeath,
Ireland. In June, 1890, he was taken ill. His
mouth tasted foul and coppery, his stomach was
sour and dead, and when he forced down a little
food he felt so much distress and pain after it that
he was sorry he hadn’t let it alone and gone
hungry. Besides this, there were pains wander-
ing through his chest, back, and sides, hurting
him, biting here and there like ugly dogs loose in
a town. His head swam with dizziness, and he
couldn’t go to his work. All his ambition and
energy were gone out of him, and he would
scarcely have exerted himself even if he had been
suddenly promoted from the position of messenger
to that of station-master of the biggest station on
the railway.
“After a while,” he goes on to say, “a dull
heavy pain struck me in the back, so I couldn’t
stoop over. What I suffered from this and the
other things put together, I have no words to
describe. I had six months of it, and it was like
six years. In such a case a man takes medicines ;
all he is told about. This I did, without getting
any good from them, and I got weaker and weaker.
Everything was a trouble to me; I couldn’t bear
things I used to think nothing of.
“ In December, 1890, just before Christmas it
was, I first heard of Mother Seigel’s Syrup and
what it had done in cases like mine. I got a
bottle from Mr. Rogers’ Drug Stores, and before
I had used all of it I felt wonderfully better ; and
by keeping on with it a short time every pain and
ache went out of me, and I was able to go about
my work as well as ever I was in my life.” These
facts are vouched for by H. Rogers, Esq., Town
Commissioner, Mullingar.
Now, what made messenger McCormack’s
nerves so sensitive, and his life so miserable for
six months? Indigestion and dyspepsia; the
same detestable malady that does the same ill
turn for millions of others, men and women, of all
sorts and conditions. Plenty of them will read
this true and simple story, and our opinion is—
founded on the best of proofs—that if they try the
remedy which cured McCormack they will come
out of it as happily as he did. But the sooner the
better.
“Boxed.”
(FO R THE BU LLE T I N.)
Mo one who has not heard two experienced and
eloquent sheep-drovers airing their stock of plain
and variegated profanity over a “boxed ” mob of
sheep can hope to realise the feats performable by
the vocal organs of man. The earnest and ener-
getic sheep-drover, under ordinary conditions, in
the absence of excitement or vanity, can objur-
gate the eyes, hair, and tail of a dog and condemn
his soul and senses in a sentence that is like a
flash of chain lightning darting round a glass.
The uninitiated bystander hears and is thunder-
struck—filled with amazement and perhaps admir-
tion. It is only when two mobs under different
hands and bearing distinct brands became bo»ed
in consequence of bad judgment or ill-luck, and
are so hopelessly mixed up as to necessitate a
return to the yards and the waste of many hours
in drafting, that the drover really brings all his
eloquence into play and exhausts his resources of
fancy language in one vivid pyrotechnic eruption.
A boxed mob is the last thing in the way of a
calamity with which fate can afflict him.
Two mobs had just left the yards after the sale.
The rule of the road had not been scrupulously
observed, and number two was close upon the
heels of the first. Both drovers had cut the thing
very fine often before without precipitating a
catastrophe. Suddenly an ungainly wether struck
out of Bill’s mob, and led for Tom’s, followed by
a long line of sheep, impelled by that fatuous
confidence in leaders that reaches the sublimity of
idiocy in sheep.
A wild whirl of trotters, a sudden rush of dogs,
a cloud of dust, and over all the vivid flashes of
profanity from two strong men in their agony.
No good ! The dust passes off, and there remains
but one flock of sheep moving in a circle.
Now, Tom and Bill aim at sublimity of expres-
sion. The inspiration of great wrath is upon
them, and they advance towards each other,
belching red-hot profanity, and their gesticula-
tions are eloquent for bloodshed.
“ You ! ” or words to
that effect.
- Biff, bang ! They have met, and each reaches
for blood and hair. Their dogs are fighting
fiercely on the roadside, and the outer circle of
sheep go round and round and stare in dumb
wonder,
Tom and Bill fight blind, but with frantic
energy. Presently they go down plump. They
sit up in the dust, panting and full of bitterness,
and glare at each other, first with hellish hate,
then with curiosity, then surprise : —
“What, Bill?”
“Tom?”
They were brothers, and had met at last, after
five long years. Hands were outstretched as they
arose, but remembrance of the calamity that had
come upon them returned again, and they resumed
the fight with undiminished enthusiasm.

Out from the towns and the dust of the cities,

Out where the zephyrs are droning their ditties,
Over the ranges and rivers I go.
Careless alike of the burdens I carry.
Be they of pleasure, or be they of pain,
I have no leisure to weep nor to tarry—
Out through the sunshine and out through the rain.
Pattering and pattering and tirelessly clattering —
Sivifter than ever the swift winds blow ;
Clattering and clattering and tirelessly chattering.
Ever my burdens of weal and woe.
Out by the downs where the reapers are reaping,
Scenting the air with the perfumes of hay ;
Out by the towns where the sleepers are sleeping,
Over the mountains away and away.
Joy in my numbers and grief in my flashes,
Passions and feelings entrusted to me,
Fly from the heart, my dots and my dashes,
Over the mountains and under the sea.
Pattering and pattering and tirelessly clattering —

Clattering and clattering and tirelessly chattering,

PAUL MELL.
The genuine, hard-shell J. Bull in his
absolutely unadulterated state is a fearful and
wonderful thing to behold. A correspondent of
Adelaide Quiz tells how he met one of the species
at Renmark. He had taken up a farm right
alongside the main irrigation channel, and had
only to dig a small ditch or two to drown his land
in moisture any time he wanted it. But there
were no irrigation ditches in Hingland, and,
therefore, he didn’t w r antthe beastly thing. When
last seen he was patiently sprinkling his twenty
dry and dusty acres with water by the aid of a
pannikin and a colander, that being the nearest
approach to the solemn British watering-pot that
he could devise. An oyster walking upstairs
isn’t a patch on the genuine Bull, with the trade-
mark blown in the bottle as a guarantee against
imitations, when he gets under entirely new
conditions.
Fame?
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
After long months of growing,
So men of science say,
The ephemeron from its earth-shell
Is franchised, and breaks away.
Its crinkled wings a-drying
In summer’s gleaming ray,
For love it stays a moment,
Then ebbs its life away,
So after feeble strivings
Man’s heart cries glad, “ ’Tis fame !”
But his generation passes,
And passes his place of name.

Dear Bulletin,— Re your paragraph anent
the old “Emily Downing,” let me add a few
afterwords. She continued one of the few whalers
faithful to the end. With her hold bricked up to
keep out the damp, she made her periodical
picnic trips provisioned with salt-horse, rotten
potatoes, and weevilly biscuit, as long as she
could decently hold together. When signs of
approaching dissolution became too apparent, she
was sold to the Tasmanian Government, and now
rides at anchor in Government House Bay,
Hobart, as a powder-hulk. Captain Willett (not

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
For me, all unaware,
At evening when the sun was nigh to set,
Love, the beguiler, spread a shining net,
Woven of a maiden’s hair.
“So flue the mesh, so light,
Ungentle ’twere to strive ” ; I let it be:
But from its web sweet hours twined stealthily
A threefold cord of might.
Since when, past force to break,
Love, Time, and Thou have forged the golden chain
I bear in these days, proudly, cho’ in pain ,
Gladly, for thy dear sake.

At latest advices there is a fearsome wash-
ing of dirty linen among the inmates of “ Beth-
shan,” Preacher Abbott’s faith-healing establish-
ment in Melbourne. Among other things it is
alleged that the brothers and sisters habitually
“kissed each other good night”—the kiss of
peace, not the sinful, buggy-muggy business of the
unregeuerate; that a sister mended the pastor’s
trousers and heaved them into his room at a late
hour ; that the pastor kissed a “dear girl ” on the
forehead and “looked upon her as a child of his
own ”; that a young lady got into the house some-
how one night, and was found sleeping on the sofa
at an early hour in the morning; that one
brother wanted to “ compel ” the sisters to go
to bed and “ submit to be anointed privately ; ”
that another brother cast reflections on the
Pastor’s morality ; that a spiritualist accused the
Pastor in a vision of having a small harem in
Brunswick ; that the Pastor didn’t kiss his wife
but kissed the other sisters instead, and that the
lady shook her fists at him. These matters having
been inquired into, the congregation passed a vote
of confidence in Pastor Abbott, and sang the
doxology, “ after which they hung about the
building in knots discussing the nauseous sub-
ject,” calmly says the Age —after itself devoting a
whole column of small type to the savoury morsel.
Prof. Allen builds an elaborate narrative
on the four severed limbs recently found bagged
in Melbourne. It reads like one of the detective
tales of Sherlock Holmes :
The man was of short stature, about fifty years of age, a
sufferer repeatedly from gout, unaccustomed to do heavy
work with his hands, did not wear rough boots, nor was
he a tramp. He was dead at the time the body was dis-
membered, but only for a few hours, and his death was
one involving a struggle, occurring in a park or field with
willow leaves about. The dismemberment of the 1 ;gs
had taken place but a little time before the parcel con-
taining them was found, and had been done in daylight,
the victim being laid on his back and then turned over to
complete the process. The man who had dismembered
the body was powerful, and used a heavy, sharp, narrow-
bladed knife; he had no professional skill in dissecting
the huimn body, and had considerable difficulty incon-
sequence ; though he went about the ghastly work with
deliberation. The exact period of death is clearly in-
dicated by rigor mortis not having set in—the legs having
but barely become cold—and by the blood continuing to
drip for some time after the legs had been found.
Likewise we believe a microscopic examination of
the hair on the arms showed that deceased was a
Primitive Methodist and had an uncle in Ger-
many, also it was deduced from the appearance of
his nails that he took little interest in politics and
contemplated taking up a selection in the mallee
district.
Matthew Davies and his brothers were
called after the Evangelists.
“Jack” Barrett, the Australian eleven
cricketer, has five brothers and a father, all
doctors.
Minister Lyne’s remark as to the secret
enemy of the N.S.W. Ministry who, while posing
as a supporter, tried to stick a dagger into the
back of the Government at every opportunity, fits
at least a dozen members.
The latest National Ass move to dis-
credit the labour unions. An individual in
the pay of the pastoralists assumed the role of a
Labour man and organised the scum of the district
into a workers’ league. They nominated a labour-
candidate, and also an emergency man if the first
did not run. It has transpired that the favoured
candidate has served three years for bestiality,
and the second, six months “on account of a
watch.” This discovery has been made in time,
and the other side is hoist with its own petard.
In Loudon recently a dog ran up to a man
in tfie street, snatched his umbrella from him, and
bolted. Later in the day the dog’s owner was
arrested for drunkenness, and with him was found
a bundle of umbrellas. He had trained his tyke
to felony.

For
All throat and lung diseases, Ayer’s Cherry
Pectoral is the best known remedy. When the
bronchial tubes are sore and obstructed with
phlegm, this medicine is invaluable. It is an
anodyne expectorant, and, in cases of deep
seated consumption, it cures the coughing,
soothes and heals the lacerated tissues, and
induces refreshing sleep. A few doses are usu-
ally sufficient to afford speedy relief in cases of
Golds and Coughs
It is also as speedily efficacious, and prompt
to allay the distressing symptoms of asthma,
bronchitis, sore throat, hoarseness, croup, and
whooping cough, and, in thousands of fami-
lies, is the only cure used. It is the best emer-
gency medicine and should always be at hand.
No household in which there are young chil-
dren, can afford to be without

CONSUI/TATION PEER
The Boss of the "Admiral Lynch.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Did you ever hear tell of Chili ? I was leadin’ the
other day
Of President Balmaceda and of how he was sent
away.
It seems that he didn’t suit ’em—they thought
that they’d like a change,
So they started an insurrection and chased him
across the range.
They seem to be restless people—and, judging by
what you hear,
They raise up these revolutions ’bout two or three
times a year;
Arid the man that goes out of office, he goes for
the boundary quick,
For there isn’t ilo vote by ballot—it’s bullets that
does the trick.
And it ain’t like a real battle; where the prisoners’
lives are spared,
And they fight till there’s One side beaten and
then there’s a truce declared,
And the man that has gdt the licking goes down
like a blooming lord
To hand in his resignation and give up his bloom-
ing sword,
And the other man bows and takes-it, and evory-
_ thing’s all polite—
This wasn’t that kind of a picnic, this wasn’t that
sort of a fight.
For the pris’ners they took—they shot ’em ) no
odds were they small or great.
If they’d collared old Balmaceda, they reckoned
to shoot him straight.
A lot of bloodthirsty devils they were—-but there
ain’t a doubt
They must have been real plucked ’uns—the way
that they fought it out,
And the king of ’em all, I reckon, the man that
could stand a pinch,
Was the bos&of a one-horse gunboat. They called
her the “ Admiral Lynch.”
Well, he was for Balmaceda,, and after the war
was clone,
And Balmaceda Was beaten and his troops had
been forced to run,
The other man fetched his army and proceeded to
do things brown,
He marched ’em into the fortress and took com-
mand of the town.
Cannon and guns and horses troopin’ along the
road,
Rumblin’ over the bridges, and never a foeman
showed
Till they came in sight of the harbour, and the
very first thing they see
Was this mite of a one-horse gunboat a-lying
against the quay.
And there as they watched they noticed a flatter
of crimson rag,
And under their eyes he hoisted old Bahnaceda’s
flag.
Well, I tell you it fairly knocked ’em—it just took
away their breath,
For he must ha’ known if they caught him, ’twas
nothin’ but sudden death.
An’ he’d got no fire in his furnace, no chance to
put out to sea,
So he stood by his gun and waited with his vessel
against the quay.
Well, they sent him a civil message to say that
the war was done,
And most of his side were corpses, and all that
were left had run;
And blood had been spilt sufficient, so they gave
him a chance to decide
If he’d haul down his bit of bunting and come on
the winning side.
He listened and heard their message, and answered
them all polite,
That he was a Spanish hidalgo, and the men of
his race must fight I
A gunboat against an army, and with never a
chance to run,
And them with their hundred cannon and him
with a single gun,
The odds were a trifle heavy—but he wasn’t the
sort to flinch,
So he opened fire on the army, did the boss of the
“ Admiral Lynch.”
They pounded his boat to pieces, they silenced his
single gun,
Atid captured the whole consignment, for none of
’em cared to run ;
And it don’t say whether they shot him —it don’t
even give his name—
But whatever they did I’ll wager that be went to
his graveyard game.
I tell you those old Hidalgo's so stately and so
polite,
They turn out the real Maginnis when it comes to
an uphill fight.
There was General Alcantara, who died in the
heaviest brunt,
And General Alzereca was killed in the battle’s
front;
But the king of ’em all, I reckon —the man that
could stand a pinch—
Was uie man who attacked the army with the
gunboat “ Admiral Lynch.”
THE BANJO.
Bpar Bulletin, — I was visited the other
■day by a swagman with a visiting-card. He was
the only swagman with a card I ever heard of.
When I opened the door he placed the mouldy
doeumjfnt in my hand saying briefly, “Please
read bpth sides.” On one side was the name in
■copper-plate, “Henry A. Schmidt.” On the
■other I read as follows : “I, Henry A. Schmidt,
have no family to support. I am not a man of
■education in reduced circumstances. I am not
ipoking for work or yearning for a chance to earn
Ihy liquid and solid nutriment. I know I have not
been washed for a month. Don’t offer me .0 job.
I am simply on the burst, tear, ran-tan, razzle-
dazzle, bender, &c. For the sake of golden Truth
■give, me some money to spend in drink and I’ll
make a beast of myself.” That was all. I gave
him balf-a-crown and told him to take his carcase
from my door and his breath from off my
verandah, and then the only candid and truthful
swagman I ever saw shuffled away down the
stree f and made for the most adjacent pub.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The brothers quarrelled—over a woman, of course.
A straight question and curt reply led the differ-
ence up to its-intensity. The younger turned and
left with a passionate curse. The day on which
his brother saved him from drowning was for-
gotten, and a thousand kindnesses once remem-
bered with affection were now consigned to the
oblivion of “ perishing dreams.” He would leave
home!
A middle-aged man sat at moonrise smoking near
a dilapidated tent under an immense eucalypt.
The light grew stronger and more silvery and, sil-
houetted against its brilliance, the surroundings
struck him with a sense of lonely wretchedness.
Gaunt, gnarled trees, with few branches and
scanty foliage, rugged ridges ribbed with jagged
rocks showed Nature’s penury ; the only softening
touch —the stream where lie cradled by day. Yet
here he had found what humanity strives for
father than ambition’s laurels—gold. “ I will
give up ilext week, and go and find out Jack and
make it dp.”
The nloon \Vas beclouded, the sleeper’s ster-
torous breathirig deased avVhild as pleasant dreams
of earlier days coursed through his brain.
A sdowl darkened his fade as he enacted that
quarrel scene agairi, arid this Was chased by a
happy smile as the dream of reconciliation and
future content evoked the murmur, “Jack, let us
forgive!”
Jack came. The curtain • door was raised, a
figure crept in, a calm, benevolent face bent over
the smiling sleeper and earnestly scanned the
well-known features. As the dreamer muttered
inaudibly, the stooping one straightened and
passed out.
What a re-union there would be in the morning !
And what a surprise the now sleeping brbther
would receive !
Alas for human hopes ! The dreamer awoke to
a glorious day, and, rising, felt for his pipe.
Gone ! Watch, too —gold—everything of value.
Arid so was Jack. He had postponed the recon-
ciliation.
THE ORPHAN.
Writes “ Steele Grey” : “Deaf Bulletin,
—ln reply to Scotty W.’s letter in issue of 19th
Nov., concerning my remarks on Madeline Smith,
were I to take his wagers seriously, I might rea-
sonably request him to forward, as per offers, one
good saddle hack and one litter of fox-terrier
pups. The lady asserted by me to be identical
with Madeline Smith was so identified by four
different persons to my own knowledge—three of
whom had not, at the time of first seeing her,
previously known she was in Australia. One of
these saw her over and over again in Glasgow,
wherehe served hisapprenticeshipand practised his
trade. He and two of the others were in Glasgow
at the time of the trial. I did not myself see her
before she left Scotland, having, unfortunately, not
been born at the time. But let me review Scotty
W.’s allegations seriatim. (1) ‘ That Madeline
Smith never married a doctor, clever or other-
wise.’ Well, whether she married the doctor or
not, she lived with him as his wife for many
years. He was certainly reputed to be distinctly
clever, and held the following excellent diplomas
—M.R.C.S. Eng., L. et L. Mid. E.P.S. Glas.,
L.S.A. Bond. (2) ‘That she never drove any
doctor to drink.’ Whether she was or was not the
prime cause of his drinking habits, their continual
quarrelling, of which her temper was one of the
chief causes, aggravated the habit exceedingly.
(3) ‘That whether masterful or mistressful, she
was a jolly nice girl once.’ Browne and Stewart
(‘ Trials for Murder by Poisoning,’ p. 296) remark
‘she was attractive in person.’ She was cer-
tainly still a handsome woman 25 years after
the trial, i.e., at the age of 46. (4) ‘That
she has no property in Melbourne under
any other name than Smith.’ This is a
question of fact which would require too much
time to definitely settle. But I can tell Scotty an
illustrative little story about her property in the
seaside village I spoke of, which throws a curious
light on item 2. She there, under her married
name, owned a pretty little villa, where she and
the doctor lived. After their last big quarrel she
came up to Melbourne, sold the villa over her hus-
band’s head, and left for England. She sold to a
well-known sharebroker, from whom the doctor
bought it back, but, being unable to meet his pur-
chase bills when due, he forfeited. The villa is
now owned by a gentleman who is brother to the
village storekeeper and to a well-known Melbourne
clergyman. (5) ‘ That if she did poison the
Jersey-man, she got rid of a contemptible sneak,
who threatened to show her letters.’ On
his own showing, L’Angelier was a liar,
a coward, and a systematic seducer. (Browne
and Stewart, pp. 295-6). Also, he certainly
threatened Madeline that he would show her
father and her intended husband her letters. He
also told the Erench Consul at Glasgow that he
had them. The reason of her anxiety to get them
out of his hands or to get rid of him may be
gathered from these extracts : “To my copy is an
appendix of the whole of the letters, including
those suppressed in court, published in New York
at the Astor Press. Happdy it is not necessary to
dwell on their disgusting details,” Browne and
Stewart, p. 294. Also, in the charge of the Lord
Justice Clerk : ‘ passionate letters written by the
prisoner, declaring such strong love for L’Angelier,
and some of them expressed in very licentious
terms.’ (6.) ‘That the case being ‘not proven,’
the notoriety is also not proven.’ It is the very
fact of the ~ ‘ not proven ’ verdict that makes the
notoriety, for that form of deliverance is so rare.
It does not mean the same as ‘acquitted,’
by any means, which fact is well illustrated
in this very case, for on the first count the verdict
was ‘ not guilty,’ whereas on the second and third
it was ‘not proven.’ The notoriety is further
shown by the fact that it is the arsenic case in
British law, and quoted in .11 the leading text-
books, e.g. Taylor (ed. Stevenson), and Browne,
and Stewart, the latter giving nearly 70 pages of
it. (7) ‘That she was not seen in Melbourne a
week or a month ago, or since about 1870.’ At
the time I wrote, someone had mentioned casually
to me that he thought he had seen Mrs. Hr.
a day or two back. I, myself, saw her many
times between 1879 and 1882 (so did the four
others above mentioned) both in Melbourne and
the sea-side village. She was at the latter place
as late as 1884. Furthermore, Madeline Smith’s
‘not proven’ verdict was due more to an extremely
clever girl and her extremely clever advocate than
to innocence. She was proved to have motive,
means and opportunity for compassing the Jersey
man’s death, and the weak point in the chain was
the absence of complete proof of their meeting on
that fatal 22nd of March.”—Yours truly, S. G.

Easily Killed
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OLLY’S pipe had gone out
between his fingers, and he
stared lugubriously into the
glowing embers, unusually
silent and meditative. We
had not lit the candle, and
the hut was illuminated only
by the flames of the fire. I
smoked and dreamed about
the golden reef we were going
to find “ when luck turned.”
Bill was the first to break the silence :
“ Didyeh ever killaman, Nig ? ”
Golly had the bad Australian habit of joining
his words together, and his conversation ran in
strings of various lengths.
“No, but if you sit there for
another ten minutes, looking as
miserable as an owl, I might accom-
modate you.”
“ Don’ mind met’night, ole chap.
This night six years ago I killed a
man, and I alwus feel a bit off on
the 14th of June.”
“ It’s the least you might do;
but are you joking ?”
“No. It’s the easiest thing in
the world to kill a (man. I saw a
chap slip off a tip’at Dunolly there,
and fall about 18 inches, and they
picked him up dead.”
“Not so easy. Tom Belton fell
down a prospecting shaft over near
Whipstick, and came up in the
bucket five minutes later, smoking
the pipe he held between his teeth
when he fell. When he went home,
he warmed up his wife because there
was something wrong with his vic-
tuals.”
“ That’s a fact, but my man died
easy—easy as puffing out a candle.
You was surprised I didn’t fight
when Maloney threw the mug, over
at Kate’s, the other night. If you’d
killed a man with a turn of your
hand, you’d stand a lot before
hitting anybody.
“I was working on a Tasma-
nian field at the time. I was
about 19, and had a job on top, at
the battery. My hut-mate was a Maorilander,
named Fay, a decent chap, and a good miner
when sober, but he used to have bursts now and
then, when he took a lot of looking after, and a
lot of bush doctoring before he was well again.
He’d start drinking, you know, and gradually
drift into mild jim-jams, then rally off with a
wild tangle, when a fellow had to lose a shift or
two, and stay around, sitting on his chest most of
the time.
“ While Fay was sober he scarcely had a word
to say, and never whispered a hint about his own
affairs, but when his spree was a week old or so,
he’d start yabbering to himself about Nelly, and a
baby, and I reckoned he’d had a split with his
wife, and they’d separated on account of some
fault of his. My mate never wrote letters him-
self, but he was always looking for one, and,
coming off night shift, his first question was,
‘ Any letter, Bill ?’ but he got none to my know-
ledge, till that night when my cursed folly finished
him.”
Golly had picked up a stick, and sat with his
face averted, fidgetting amongst the embers.
“ I got to looking for this letter he was always
expecting as eager as himself, and when it did
come, and I saw it was addressed in a woman s
hand, I was as glad as a kid about it. I liked the
man, damn it, and hoped things would come out
right and comfortable with him. Fay had been
drinking two or three days when the letter arrived,
and I guessed it wouldn’t be much good to him
for some time. He came into the hut late that
night. It had been raining, and he was wet and
dirty. I had a good fire on, and stood with my
back to it, watching him. He staggered on to his
bunk, and sat there, with his head working, and
his fingers twitching and plucking at his coat.
There was a bark shelf like ours over the fire, and
the letter was reared against the tea-box, just
beside my head.
“ When Fay looked up there was a nasty glare
in his eyes, and he stared at me in a way that
made me shiver a bit. I was always nervous with
a man far gone in drink, and I’d seen Fay in
the humour for ugly things. Besides, I was a
youngster, and knew that my mate was near the
stage when he wouldn’t know me from a gohanna
or a bunyip. He got up after a bit, and staggered
over towards me, clawing like. If I hadn’t been
a fool I’d a just taken hold of him, and forced
him on to his bunk again. I was strong enough
to do it, but I was a fool, and when he came too
close, and seemed to be trying to grip me, I hit
out—not hard, only half a push. He went down,
over backwards across a candle-box, with ins head
under his arm, so he never got up again.
“ Dead as a door-nail! He’d dislocated his neck
or something. Good God ! what a time I spent
over him. He had the letter gripped in his dead
hand. It was that he was after, not me.
“The coroner came down from Launceston, and
there was an inquest. I said nothing about
having struck at Fay. I funked.on it, and told
them he had fallen over the box in drink; but I
gave myself away when they opened the letter,
and read it. It was from his wife. She was
living in Christchurch, with her father, and wrote
to say that she forgave everything, and wanted
him to come home at once, and they would be
happy again. She said she had not let their boy
forget his father.
“That finished me. I planked down in the
room, and howled ; said I’d killed him, that I was
a murderer, and wanted them to hang me, and
carried on like a lunatic. This made the case bad
against me, but there was a postponement, and
when the inquest came on again my story was be-
lieved, and a verdict of accidental death returned.
It’s easy to kill a man, Nig, but hard to forget
it.”
Golly dropped the stick, and hid his face in his
hands, and I went out and left him a while.

Sydney Morning . Herald, “brushing

The story of a dutiful son is told in a
recent Japanese paper. His aged mother’s eye-
sight was failing, and the local witch or rain-
maker or debbil-debbil-woman told him that a
human liver was the only thing that could restore
her. Thereupon he decided to commit hari-kari,
and instructed his wife to hand over his liver to
her mother-in-law as soon as he was deceased.
The wife objected strongly and insisted on com-
mitting suicide herself. Finally they tossed for
it, and the wife losing, her husband reluctantly
choked her, and proceeded to cut het up, but the
police arrived in the midst of the operation and
ran him in; consequently the wife is dead, and
the husband is in gaol, and the old blind mothef
didn’t get the required liver after all.

Pure blood is a life-long delight. It is health—real good health and
strength—free from pimples, spots, sores and aches.
Have pure blood by taking Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets internally, and use
a really good modern soap—Frazer’s Sulphur Soap —externally, and you

secured by Soap alone. It cannot. A pure Soap—Frazer’s Sulphur Soap

we must get it as pure as we can,

business. Else if he be blotchy, pimply, or disfigured, othey men fight shy
of dealing with him. Let the man take Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets internally
and use Frazer’s Sulphur Soap externally.
A woman needs a good complexion else her happiness is decreased, and
her charm to the other sex much lessened. Let the woman take Frazer s
Sulphur Tablets internally and use Frazer’s Sulphur Soap externally.
A child for its health’s sake needs a rosy skin, free from eruptive
blemish, and a blood free from the taint of fever and infectious germs. Lei
the child take Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets internally and use Frazer’s Sulphm
Soap externally,

that holds disease at bay and gives health.
Frazer’s Sulphur Soap renders the skin soft, supple and smooth, neither
drying the oils of the skin, nor shrivelling the nails, nor splitting the hairs.

fat. It is simple and truly the best of all Soaps, and contains Oil of
Eucalyptus.

A Poor Joke.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
you can’t count me in, boys; I’m off it—
I’m jack 0’ them practical jokes,
They ain’t neither pleasure ner profit,
An’ th’ fellers that plays ’em is mokes.
I’ve got sense, but I once was a duffer,
An’ I fooled up my share, I allow,
But since conscience hes made me t’ suffer—
She’s peggin away et me now.
“ You notice I’ve aged rather early,
An’ th’ wrinkles is deep on my face ?
That’s sorrer—l’m sixty-nine, barely,
Jes’ camp, an’ I’ll tell yeh my case-.
’Twas here on The Springs hi the Sixties,
We Was Workin’ tire lead on this spot;
An’ we was, t admit it betwixt yes,
A father unprincipled lot.
u We Was drunk most th’ day on th’ Sundays—
Thet licker is hell, I insists—
An’ our exercise mostly on Mondays
War feats of endoorance with fists.
See, the wash wasn’t what we called wealthy—
Ten pennyweight stuff, there about—
An’ we took matters easy an’ healthy,
Tho’ we’d rush for the same now, no doubt;
“ Well, one rnoruin’, frum over th’ border.,
Two Mongols moved inter th’ camp,
Which we voted a tiling out of order—
The climate for <3hows was too damp).
But it happened A couple of troopers
Arrived on The Springs that same week;
So the Chinks, in their opium stoopers,
Didn’t wander down inter th’ creek,
“ Or get drowned in th’ dam at The Crescent,
As we reckoned might happen somehow ;
But they settled down, easy an’ pleasant,
An’ there wasn’t th’ smell of a row.
Howsomdever, we wasn’t long twiggm’
Th’ Chows was a ignerent pair,
An’ knew nothin’ at all about diggin’,
An’ that was our chance t’ get square.
“It was ’cordin’ t’ Bastow’s directions,
Tho’ I volunteered fer th’ game,
Fer t’ collar th’ heathens’ affections,
An’ lay them right on to a claim
Round th’ bend where we’d bottomed a duffer—
Meself an’ Pat Foley—right there,
Where th’ sinkin’ is deeper an’ tougher
Than th’ holes of OehCnnar, I swear.
“That shaft was a reg’lar clinker—
I was cursin’ it on’y t’day—
Quite a fortni’t it took us t’ sink her,
An’ then we come through on th’ clay—
Not the ghost of a han’full of gravel.
Well, we dropped it without any fuss,
On th hill pegged the best we could snavcl,
An’ th’ devil could prospect, fer us.
“ Course tho Pagans was not a bit wiser,
An’ I counted it pretty fair game
T’ put up es their friend an’ adviser,
An’ induce ’em t’ take up that claim,
By a-crackin’ th’ lay an’ position,
So’s t’ get ’em t’ sink on th’ clay.
Till they struck a hot shop in Perdition
Or tapped water in Europe some day.
“ But th’ monkeys was mighty suspicious,
Wouldn’t have it I cared for their sakes—
Here I think thet all Chinkies is vicious
An’ hate ’em like fever an’ snakes.
Then I tried a new system of dealing
An’ offered advice et a fee,
An’ they caught on immedjit. Fine feelin’
Is wasted on any Chinee.
“ So they pegged out our cast-off, th’ duffer,
Their ‘rights ’ they had took out exact,
An’ Ah Kit, who was boss, wouldn’t suffer
Not th’ smallest neglect of the Act,
An' I put in their pegs to a fraction,
Es grave es a brick on a hob,
Rigged up things t’ their full satisfaction,
An’ charged ’em five quid for the job.
“ Well, th’ heathens soon set their pegs goin*,
An’ they seemed rather fond o’ th’ graft,
Tho’ th’ boys hed took trouble in stowin’
A heap o’ dead things in th’ shaft,
An’ we chuckled an’ thought we had got ’em.
I knew I could tickle th’ pair
T’ keep sinkin’ on inter th’ bottom
For gravel that never was there.
“Next night a most harrowin’ rumour
Went round, an’ th’ camp was half daft :
It wus said thet a nugget—a boomer—
Hed bin took by th’ Chows from our shaft.
Point of fact thet th’ Pagans had struck it,
Hed knocked down a sample o’ wash
Thet looked good fer a pound t’ th’ bucket,
An’ our joke hed gone hopelessly squash.
“ It was c’rect, boys, by all that is holy !
We’d hit a “ false bottom,”* sure’s fate,
An’ th’ fortune of self an’ of
Was scooped by Ah Kit an’ his mate.
We resolved thet these Chinese was sappin’
Th’ wealth o’ th’ land, an’ agreed
Somethin’ serious was goin’t’ happen,
When th’ troopers rode on t’ th’ lead.
“ Yes, we scrambled fer claims all around ’em,
An’ we made th’ foam fly for a week,
But th’ Chows hed th’ gilt edge. Confound ’em,
They’d lobbed right on top o’ th’ streak !
No, your joke, boys, I reckon is risky,
An’ somewhat ridic’lus, I doubt,
But I’m with you fer frien’dship an’ whisky
If one of ye’s game nuf t’ shout.”
EDWARD DYSON.
* It has happened in sinking on alluvial fields that a
streak of the strata which usually underlies the wash (the
“bottom”) has been found immediately above it, the
result of a geological freak. This has occasionally
deceived even diggers of some experience, and led them
to abandon claims as duffers which, when subsequently
sunk a little further, have proved to be golden holes.
There are moments in the lives of each of us
when, in the midst of unexpected, unforeseen danger, we
shall require (o exercise to its utmost extent all the
nervoui power we may possess. And there is no greater
foe or danger to happiness than debility, which ought to
be carefully warded off. In the following case Mr. E.
Robinson, of Tumut, N.S.W., gives his experience of it:
“ For the last three or four years I have been conscious
that my strength, and in an equal degree my spirits, were
waning. I was losing all interest in anything and in
everything. I could not account for it. lat last began
to suspect I might have the seeds of consumption sown in
my system, and that they were bringing forth fruit. I
saw your advertisement in the Sydney Herald, and
resolved to try what Marshall’s Tonic Nervine could do
for me—this was five months ago. I have completed a
course of 18 bottles, and I can truly say a man in better
health and spirits cannot exist. I eat well, sleep well,
and take any amount of physical exercise, long walks,
and feel no fatigue, and my strength is apparent to me in
every movement I make, every step I take. All this I
owe to you and your sovereign remedy. Let the world
know. You are only too welcome to publish this, in the
hope other poor sufferers may make use of your strength
giving fluid.” Will “other poor sufferers” hesitate now?
Marshall's Tonic Nervine is within the reach of all.

PILLS

*
Are universally admitted
to be worth a Guinea
a Box for bilious
and nervous disorders,
such as wind and pain in
the stomach, sick head-
ache, giddiness, fulness
and swelling after meals,
dizziness, and drowsiness,,
cold chills, flushings of
heat, loss of appetite,
shortness of breath, cos-
tiveness, scurvy, blotches
oh the skin, disturbed

and all nervous and trem-
bling sensations, &c. The
first dose will give relief
in twenty minutes. Every
iufferer is earnestly invited to try one box of these
Pills, and they will be acknowledged to be
Worth a Guinea a Box.
For females of all ages these Pills are
as a few doses of them carry off all humors, and
bring about all that is required. No female should
be without them. There is no medicine to be found
equal to BEECHAM’S PILLS for removing any
obstruction or irregularity of the system. If taken ac-
cording to the directions given with each box they will
soon restore females of all ages to sound and robust
health. This has been proved by thousands who have
tried them, and found the benefits which are ensured by
their use
For a weak stomach, impaired digestion and all disorders
of the liver, they act like “ MAGIC,” and a few doses will
be found to work wonders upon the most important
Drgans in the human machine. They strengthen the
whole muscular system, restore the long-lost complexion,
bring back the keen edge of appetite, and arouse into ac-
tion with the ROSEBUD of health the whole physical
energy of the human frame. These are “EXACTS” testified
continually by members of all classes of society; and
one of the best guarantees to the nervous and debilitated

THE ESTATE OF
FONTAINEBLEAU,
WENTWORTH FALLS.
'THIS MAGNIFICENT ESTATE of 239 ACRES has been
■** surveyed by Messrs. Miller and Lewis, of Pitt Street,
Sydney, into 138 Allotments, ranging from 1 Acre
Residential Blocks to 10£ Acres, situate only 500 yards
from the WENTWORTH FALLS RAILWAY STATION,
on the opposite side of the line. It embraces all that fine
and elevated land opposite the mansion of R. M. Pitt,
Esq., whose splendid garden excites the admiration of
every passenger on the Great Western railway.
When the delightful climate of Wentworth Falls is taken
into consideration, the place may be safely described as
Tlic Madeira of the Blue Mountains.
Delicate constitutions and worn-out business men are
benefited equally by the refreshing purity of the (mountain
air, and the estate is not surpassed for residential purposes.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE
Is well described by the poet, viz.:—
The vvaratahj all gleaming red,
Lifting in pride its stately head,
, Shines through the clustering ferns ;
While as the wattle’s yellow bloom
trails in soft showers, its. deep perfume
The air to sweetness turns.
Would you this haunt of beauty know ?
’Tis the charming Estate of Fontainebleau !
The Blaxland Road is now being made from the Railway
fence, and, as it runs right through this magnificent estate,
it will, when finished, be without exception the finest
Carriage Drive on the Mountains.
The FONTAINEBLEAU ESTATE is the mdst elevated
and beautiful about Wentworth Falls —far and away
superior to the land on the other side of the line. The
picturesque views and the extreme fertility of the soil
renders the place very attractive, and specially adapted
for Fruit or Flower Gardens, Orchards or Dairy Farms,
for which Natdre seems to have intended it.
ygT Early Buyers will do wall to secure their Lots at
once, as they are likely to largely advance in value. The
terms are liberal, to suit all buyers. For lithos., arid all
