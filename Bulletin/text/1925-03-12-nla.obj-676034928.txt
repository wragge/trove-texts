The Red Page
The Maker of “the Mighty Line”
liichard Meredith, discussing the merits
of Bernard Shaw’s “Saint Joan” and “the
modern revulsion from the sweet restraint
the Elizabethans found so acceptable” in the
blank-verse form of dialogue, curiously omits
mention of Christopher Marlowe, the inspired
creator and master of that medium. Among
the dramatists who used blank verse in
works intended for representation on the
stage, Meredith mentions (pre-eminently)
Shakspeare, Beaumont and Fletcher, Ben
Jonson, Massinger, Webster, Heywood,
Dekker “and a host of others, through Dry-
den to Shelley.” The omission of Marlowe
is all the more remarkable inasmuch as
Meredith cites “Richard the Third,” which is
so obviously inspired by the author of “Tam-
burlaine,” if not, in great part, written by
him: Professor Edward Dowden considers
that in “Richard III.” “Shakspeare was
working, though not in the presence, yet
under the influence and in the manner of
the great master of dramatic blank verse,
Marlowe.”
The author of “Hamlet” and “Macbeth”
inherited his (theatre ; he did not invent it.
As Symonds writes:—
He t Shakspeare] stands alone, and has no second ;
but without the multifarious excellences of Jonson,
Webster, Heywood, Beaumont, Fletcher, Ford, Mas-
singer, and a score it would be tedious to enumerate,
the student would have to regard Shakspeare as an
inexplicable prodigy, instead of as the central sun
of a luminous sidereal system.
This is but a restatement of William Haz-
litt’s appreciation of the dramatic writers
of the age of Elizabeth, in which he speaks
of Shakspeare as towering above his fellows,
in shape and gesture proudly eminent; but
one of a race of giants—“the tallest, the
strongest, the most graceful and beautiful
of them. But it was a common and a noble
brood.” Ilazlitt says, moreover, that we
affect to wonder at Shakspeare and one or
two more of that period as solitary instances
upon record, whereas it is our own dearth
of information that makes the waste; for
than the Elizabethan there was no time more
populous of intellect, or more prolific of in-
tellectual wealth. The truth of the matte
has been correctly stated by J. A. Symond
in his survey of the British drama of th
Renaissance during the reigns of Elizabet
and James, in which he shows that, soo
after the year 1580, a group of cultivate!
men began to give something like the form
of high _ art to the romantic drama. Thes
young lions were Richard Edwards, Georg
Whetstone, John Lyly, Robert Green
George Peele, Thomas Lodge and Thomas
Nash; and their chief importance consistet
in their having contributed to the formatio
of Marlowe’s style. Of Marlowe himsel
Symonds writes: —
It was he who irrevocably decided the destinies
the romantic drama ; and the whole subsequent evolu
tion of that species, including Shakspeare’s work, ca
be regarded as the expansion, rectification and artisti
ennoblement of the type fixed by Marlowe’s epoch
making tragedies. In very little more than 50 year
from the publication of “Tamburlaine,” our dram
had run its course of unparalleled energy anc
splendor.
Symonds takes the whole mass of plays writ
ten for the British stage from 1587 op
wards as the subject-matter of a sing]
critical inquiry, leading up from the Morali
ties, through Dyly, Peele, Greene, Nash and
Lodge, to Marlowe —who “fixes the specifi
type of the Romantic Drama for England.”
Professor Ashley Thorndyke, less flam
boyantly than Symonds,- points out that by
the time Shakspeare began his career, com
panies of professional actors were securely
established in London ; that they had built
playhouses, won the favor of the Court and
the patronage of a large public, and were
beginning to attract brilliant young men
from the universities as playwrights; whilst
by this time, tragedy was well initiated as
a species of the popular drama, told in
splendid verse and with imaginative ideal-
ism. Of this popular tragedy, writes Thorn-
dyke, the chief creator was Marlowe, and
any account of the pre-Shakspearean drama
must be at pains to emphasise his import-
ance :
His plays deal with prodigious desires and the
failures which inevitably result, and their dramatic
interest centres upon the volitional struggles of their
mighty protagonists. Marlowe freed himself from
all allegiance to Senecan technique or diction, ant
devoted himself valiantly to the public theatres, pro-
viding his actors with great parts, his audience with
sensation, spectacle and rant, and the drama with
genuine passion and exuberant poetry. His tragedies
formed a type and set a fashion, and for several years
all. blank verse echoed his cadences.
It was in the Spring of 1593 that the
plague raged in London, and the theatres
were closed. The actors went, therefore,
into the provinces, Marlowe to the little
village of Deptford, where he was killed, in
a quarrel over a wanton’s bought kisses, by
the hand of “a bawdy serving-man.” He
was buried in some spot unknown beneath
the towers of St. Nicholas’s Church, and an
entry was made in the parish-book to this
effect: “Christopher Marlow, slain by
ffrancis Archer, the 1 of June, 1593.”
The historian John Richard Green
acclaims the pre-Shakspearean dramatists,
Nash, Peele, Kyd, Greene and Marlowe, in
noble phrase. To both the prose and the
verse of Robert Greene he accords pre-
eminent praise; but his valuation of Mar-
lowe is even higher. He writes :
In a far higher degree than Greene he is the
creator of the English drama Marlowe burst on th*
world, in the year which preceded the tviumph over
the Armada, with a play which at once wrought a
revolution in the English stage. Bombastic and
extravagant as it was.... “Tamburlaine” not only
indicated the revolt of the new drama against the
timid inanities of euphuism, but gave an earnest of
that imaginative daring, the secret of which Marlowe
was to bequeath to the playwrights who followed
him. He perished at 30 in a shameful brawl, but in
his brief career he had struck the grander notes of
the coming drama.
The gentle Charles Lamb is so taken with
reprehending the subject-matter of Marlowe’s
plays that he has no time to devote to a
consideration of his exuberant poetry. For-
tunately, William Hazlitt makes ample
amends, and places him second only to
Shakspeare. Hazlitt finds in the writings
of Marlowe a lust of power, “a hunger and
thirst after unrighteousness, a glow of the
imagination unhallowed by anything but its
own ergies”: his thoughts burning within
him, or “throwing out black smoke and mists
that hide the dawn of genius; or, like a
poisonous mineral, corrode the heart.” Haz-
litt collects a number of single lines “that
seem struck out in the heat of a glowing
fancy, and leave a track of golden fire behind
them.” But though much has been written
of “Marlowe’s mighty line,” it would be very
unjust to the dramatist if we assumed his
incapacity for lofty eagle-flights.
The most appreciative modern notice of
Marlowe (omitting the over-emphasised
eulogies of Swinburne) is the monograph
of Havelock Ellis, which is a performance
as just as it is brilliant. Ellis, a very well
balanced critic, refuses to be dazzled with
time-honored and conventional repetitions.
Thus he notes that it has long been a cus-
tom among critics to compare Marlowe’s
“Edward II.” with Shakspeare’s “Richard
ll.”—a foolish comparison which does gross
injustice to each playwright. It certainly
is very unfair to Shakspeare, for “the melo-
dramatic and careless murder of Richard
cannot be mentioned in presence of the
chastened tragedy and highly wrought pathos
of Edward’s last days”:—
The whole of Shakspeare’s play, with its exuberant
eloquence, its facile and diffuse poetry, is distinctly
inferior to Marlowe’s, both in organic structure and
in dramatic characterisation. It was not till 10
years later that Shakspeare came near to this severe
reticence, these deep and solemn tragic tones.
Hazlitt, however, takes the different view,
and considers that “Edward II.” will bear
“on the whole but a distant comparison with
Shakspeare’s ‘Richard ll.’ in conduct,
power or effect.” Nevertheless, Hazlitt hast-
ens to say, “But the death of Edward 11.,
in Marlowe’s tragedy, is certainly superior
to that of Shakspeare’s King; and in heart-
breaking distress, and the sense of human
weakness, claiming pity from utter helpless-
ness of conscious misery, is not surpassed
by any writer whatever.” Even Charles
Lamb, who is not too greatly predisposed
in Marlowe’s favor as a dramatist, says,
“The death-scene of Marlowe’s King moves
pity and terror beyond any scene, ancient
or modern, with which I am acquainted.”
It stands to the credit of Australian litera-
ture that the tercentenary of Marlowe’s
tragic taking-off was marked by two poets,
both of Sydney, in sonnets of power and
vision—metrical wreaths from the Land
of the Southern Cross laid on the cenotaph
of Christopher Marlowe by John Le Gay
Brereton and Arthur Bayldon.

What Is Ahead of Man?
Our evolution is a retrograde evolution,
our civilisation a process of degeneration.
Our organs, once functionally perfect, are
slowly but surely losing their power to
function. Eventually they will be abso-
lutely useless to us.
Fortunately the amount of degeneration in
our optical equipment, resulting from its
increasing use for near vision, as in reading,
has not yet reached the stage where artificial
correction by lenses cannot, in most cases,
be satisfactorily accomplished. But with
our collective range of vision becoming
rapidly more and more limited, the inevitable
result must be the total blindness of the
human race. Although in the process of
evolution the female pelvis is diminishing
in size and the maternal mortality increasing
proportionately, child-bearing is still possible
in the more civilised, countries to those who
are sufficiently unenlightened to risk the
ordeal. When child-birth by the present
ordinary route is no longer possible owing,
to the small size of the pelvis, Csesarian
Section will be the order of the day. But by
that time the preponderance of females over
males both in number and in authority in
the world will have reached such a high level
that the women will not submit to these
oppressions by the surgeon.
The best examples of a gdod sense of
smell and of taste are to be found among
the primitive types of man. One portion of
the organ of smell, still present in the lower
animals, has completely atrophied in man.
With our initial sparse supply of hair and
the increasing prevalence of premature bald-
ness, there remain only a fortunate few who
have escaped the abomination of hats as an
artificial protection for the head. Teeth,
once such an asset, now merely cause pain,
rascibility and physical invalidity until they
are replaced by artifacts. With the pur-
suance of our present ways of living, consti-
lation is rapidly becoming a human charac-
teristic, and cascara almost a panacea. The
universal use of synthetic and pre-digested
foods, however, is being advocated by the
more “advanced” schools, so that) the captur-
ing, growing, tasting, masticating and digest-
ing of our nutriment will be no longer neces-
sary. The “descent of man” physically has
already reached the stage where the amount
of activity compatible with his well-being is
said to be 44 hours a week.
These stigmata of degeneration are appal-
lingly evident at every turn. On the other
hand, the brain of man is increasing in mass
and improving in utility. Inventive genius
is undoubtedly manifesting a startling growth
and even though it is being applied more to
discovery of new methods of destruction than
to new means of combating our physical de-
cadence, more to the annihilation of the fit-
test than to the amelioration of the unfit,
still the improvement in one portion of our
anatomy, at any rate, is a gratifying reflec-
tion for the present. Though we cannot
avert the fate of the human race, we may
mend our ways and postpone the time when
man will be merely a peripatetic mass of
brain matter, “sans teeth, sans eyes, sans
taste, sans everything.

It is fortunate that in these days, when
primitive races are fast being hurried off

ot anthropology and ethnology should en-

with his immediate task to search out
obscure practices and beliefs, or to record

curious facts. The trader was men mo*®

missionary, fourth of the group, was also
hampered, but in a different way. H s
gave him the greatest opportunity, foi it was
based on an intimacy with primitive society,
its ways of thought and modes ot living,
without the close personal bond success was
not possible. But the very reason for the
evangelist’s presence the preaching of a -
ideal, often made Ins unique advantages
useless. He could not see the. wood tor
the trees; he could only see what seemed
cruelty, beastiality, debauchery and a host
of other iniquities, which had to be obliter-
ated to clear the ground for the planting of
his own ideals and customs. lhese good
intentions have proved too successful in
many lands. The teaching of the 1 ale Uai-
lilean,” as interpreted by the missionary,
lias destroyed beyond reclamation a host or
primitive beliefs, with their social and cul-
tural offspring. The official, too, is not blame-
less, with his substitution of new laws tor
old and his suppression of others deemed un-
worthy without inquiry into the reason
underlying the originals. Still the mission-
ary must bear the greater blame.
That there are exceptions may be seen m
Frimitive New Guinea, by the Rev. J. 1L
Holmes, of the London Missionary Society
(Seeley, Service and Co.). Mr. Holmes is
an evangelist who is a noted anthropologist
as well —one who can drive religion and
science tandem without tangling them up.
For quarter of a century he has been a cor-
respondent of the Royal Anthropological In-
stitute, and his book is an epitome of many
papers contributed to the society. Clo-
thing so complete of its kind has yet seen
print, wherefore it hardly requires the eulo-
gistic introduction by the famous Cambridge
ethnologist. Dr. A. C. Iladdon. The groups
discussed are the Ipi and Namau, two
loosely-knitted tribal confederations living
on the Gulf coast. The boundary between
them is but a small stream, the Alele, a
tributary of the great Purari River, on the
delta of which the Namau dwell. Fast ot
the boundary are the Ipi, coast-dwellers,
monogamists, totemists, abhorring cannibal-
ism. To the west abide the Namau in a
tidal swamp. These are polygamists, main-
tainers of hordes of concubiiies, till lately
cannibals, and in religion animistic, if one
may call animism a religion. Both are artis-
tic carvers, and, considering their means,
mighty architects. One would lean to the
Ipi as the more refined and intellectual of
the two groups. Mr. Holmes, for his part,
is not so sure.
Elaborate feasting and dancing, with
masked ceremonial rites, are common to Ipi
and Namau ; but the latter, in the not-so-
distant days of which the author tells, had
one ceremony peculiar to themselves vhe
Iva, or Feast of the Concubines.. Each
Namau tribe invited the others in its turn,
and it is in his description of this function,
which is still continued, that the author
drops the impassivity of science and takes
on the mantle of the missionary again. This
quick change occurs once again when de-
scribing a Namau return from a victorious
raid and the arrangements made by the
young ladies of the tribe to reward the suc-
cessful warriors. Nevertheless, the author,
as a man of science, admits, that , from the
practical-minded Papuan’s viewpoint, these
reprehensible practices were justified. A
raiding, fighting tribe must swiftly replace
the warriors lost in battle, if it is to exist.
The Ipi, as has been recorded, is a totem-
ist. Among these tribes, however, though
a man may not eat or harm his own totem,
he cannot prevent one of another totem
doing so. If a man of the “goanna” totem
sees a “shark” man killing his totem for
dinner, all he can do is to utter the maea /?,
the sympathetic cry, assuring the meal-soon-
to-be of his sympathy. This, by the way,
is a custom not .unknown among non-totemic
peoples. “Totemism was the law of life to
the Ipi tribes.... It was their profession of
belief in the cult which was the heart and
soul of life as they knew it.” The Namau,
on the other hand, would have none of indi-
vidual totemism. They combined a species
of group totemism with a regard for holy
places, the Apwa Maku. This outwardly-
degraded folk were and are steeped m an
animistic cult they call Imunu. a cult as old
as history, and one still favored by people ot
higher culture and civilisation than these
swamp-dwelling cannibals. “Imunu was
associated with everything Nothing could
exist without it. It was the soul of things
....A man was a man and not a dog, be-
cause a man’s imunu dwelt in him and not
a dog’s.” The imunu of plant or tree, man
or beast, died when its host perished. To
his cook-boy one day Holmes said that his
table ought to have an imunu. Cookie re-
plied that it had. His master contended that
this was nonsense, since the table was made
by man. The boy scraped some dry rot from
the table with his finger-nails, saying: “Those
pellets come from the table....By and bye
the table will waste away altogether. Then,
and not till then, will its imunu flee away
and it will no longer be a table Each of
these little pellets has its imunu. If it
had not, we could not see it, it could not be.”
If is curious that this savage of the slime
should have re-created the beautiful old
classic cult, put the dryad bsick again in her
tree and re-endowed the sticks and stones
with a soul. .
The official, the missionary and the man
of commerce are rapidly changing the old
order, and Mr. Holmes has high hopes for
the future of his beloved people. Unlike
most of his cloth, he thinks that “the com-
mercial life” with proper safeguards will
afford their best means of uplift. From the
very beginning, the man with something to
sell or buy is the one the Papuan, with his
intense “business instinct.” has best under-
stood among his white-skinned invaders; the
official and the missionary were probably
mad ’ and certainly unaccountable, whereas
“the man who had something to barter for
something they were willing to dispose of
seemed to them to be a perfectly sane being.”

Through Thirty Years
In a former article we left Wickham
Steed's first volume just’as the idiot archdukes
were preparing to send an ultimatum to
Serbia because of the murder of that one
who was suspected to be a general paralytic;
and, horror upon horror piled, it was even
believed that the murder itself was a part
of the general evil of the Hapsburgs, 1 1 1£ J S ,7
much as it was thought to be a “put-up job
to prevent Francis Ferdinand from inherit-
ing the throne. Because of that millions ot
honest men died; the whole world was rent
in twain; women wept from the W hite bea
to the Bight; our own land obtained its
bloody baptism of fire, and won glory at
what a cost! All because of a set of halt-
wits and one megalomaniac, swayed by a
dead hand that had never been properly
alive. , .
Many years before, “the Tiger had pro-
phesied that Germany would invade France
through Belgium, and had forecasted exactly
how the war would begin and how England
would be dragged into it, strive she never
so furiously for peace at anv price. But, he
said sadly, our statesmen are so stupid, they
will not listen. M. Clemenceau in the cold
realism of his outlook saw more clearly than
our Government: and even after the German
troops were on the move and Clemenceau s
forecast was proving only too accurate, it
was with the utmost difficulty that Steed
and the Times, of which lie was then editor,
were able to force the Germanophile mem-
bers of the British Cabinet to see the truth.
At the very last moment it was owing to
the flat insubordination of a humble post-
office official that our Government came to
suspect the preparations for espionage that
Germany had instituted in the midst of
friendly England. He noticed that a great
number of letters were being sent to a certain
address in Charlottenburg. At the risk of his
own position he detained and opened them;
they were letters to the German secret ser-
vice, and their discovery checkmated many
of the wide-spread plans for spying that
the Hun had so carefully laid in England.
Vast efforts were made by the international
German-Jew financiers to make the Times
advocate neutrality; no effort was spared to
buy, bully or cajole it to cease its stern
demand that England should do her duty at
all costs, and it came almost as a relief to
Steed and Northcliffe when the Germans
really marched through Belgium as Clemen-
ceau' had foretold, and at once made the
war one on the very highest moral plane
such as alone could stir the hearts of Eng-
lishmen. For, as Steed very truly says,
most Englishmen are mildly and some in-
tensely religious: for all our crass stupidity
we are at heart a nation of idealists and sen-
timentalists, and the moment a question of
moral right or wrong came to the fore we
immediately saw the right and went bald-
headed to ensure that it should prevail. Steed
seems to think that Sir Edward Grey acted
wisely, or at least rightly, in purposely re-
fusing to say whether England would fight
to protect France, until the moral issue be-
came so obvious that even Liberal states-
man could not evade it. Whether wise or
not, at least he acted like a man of honor.
How better could a man act?
By his intimate knowledge of the Balkans
Steed became a sort of leader for the
numerous nationals of the downtrodden little
branches of the Hapsburg monarchy who had
found refuge in London—pallid little tuber-
culous artists and hunchbacks who burned
to fight, but whom no army would have en-
listed. With the utmost trouble Steed was
sometimes able to send them to _ the Front,
where many of them, under the influence of
fresh air, exercise and the knowledge that
they were really at last doing something
against the hated archdukes, blossomed into
splendid soldiers who learned to inveigle
their co-mates and brothers in exile into
a glorious surrender; for almost as many
fought on the side of the Russians, and were
quite ready to surrender if they could be
sure that the Austrians would not shoot them
when they held their hands up.
It is impossible even to make a precis of
this second volume. All we can do is to
tell how Steed and Northcliffe became the
leaders of the counter-propaganda which had
so disheartening an effect upon the Germans;
for they fought them with their own weapons
of espionage and moral enfeeblement. They
sent aeroplanes over the enemy lines to drop
leaflets which told the truth and nothing
but the truth. These leaflets, written in the
most vigorous German, found their way to
the homes of the German people, and con-
vinced the women that their husbands were
fighting a war in which they must inevitably
lose, because the whole world was against
them and there was no truth in their Gov-
ernment. It is probable that Steed himself
wrote many of these leaflets, for he had
learned to speak German like a native when
he .studied philosophy in Germany and had
learned to admire Bismarck, whose advice,
had it been followed, would have saved the
megalomaniac emperor from his crowning
folly. , , ~
At last the war came to an end, and the
enemy sued for peace. Then was to be
seen how Lloyd George, though he had
seemed so gallant and fierce during the war,
was at heart but a politician eager to turn
everything to what appeared a present advan-
tage rather than to act according to the prin-
ciples which he had professed. It is pitiful
to see how the Allies sent hordes of diplo-
matists to dwell in great hotels that almost
seem to have been fortified against each other
lest they should meet and compare notes as
to the wisest thing to do. The British
arrested Clemenceau when he tried to attend
a dinner given in his own honor, and the
Americans arrested Foch in somewhat simi-
lar circumstances. It sounds like cbmic
opera. Steed insists that Lloyd George so
insulted Clemenceau that the brave old Tiger
promptly challenged him to a duel, and
President Wilson had to drag Clemenceau
from Lloyd George’s throat. It is a pity
Wilson did not go the whole hog and act as
second to one of the combatants; he would
thus have added to the gaiety of nations far
more than he did by enforcing a futile and
idealistic peace that was far in advance of
the national feelings of the peoples which had
to make it.
The Germans also sent a vast male and
female delegation which signalised itself by
getting abominably drunk. It reminds
one of the shocking orgies in the for-
nices outside the Colosseum after the
gladiatorial exhibitions. Men and women
have always been the same, prone to turn
to love to relieve themselves of intolerable
emotion of any kind.
C. McL.
Genius
There must always be something of mys-
tery about genius and the genius, and it is not
easy to define briefly that surpassing gift:
but it seems to me about time we challenged
the old and easy definitions of dogmatic
writers like Carlyle and Ruskin, who denied
the gift altogether. Carlyle declared that
genius was “a capacity for work” ; and Rus-
kin agreed with him, calling it merely a
'‘capacity for taking pains.” It is amazing
how generally the definition has been
accepted. William Hogarth, the artist,
called genius “nothing but labor and dili-
gence” ; and Matthew Arnold, “mainly an
affair of energy.” It is plain without further
quoting that this is the generally accepted
idea of that which was once considered the
divine fire, the unattainable gift of the
gods.
It is true that he whom we call a genius
must have the “capacity for taking pains” if
his gift is to be given adequate expression :
but without the inborn power no amount of
taking pains could produce a work of genius.
The lunatia who collects postage-stamps with
infinite trouble and enthusiasm for half a
century, or the violin virtuoso who practises
six hours a day all his life, and plays with-
out soul or understanding but with perfect
technique, is not a genius.. If Carlyle and
Ruskin are right, then Southey was a
genius, and so was George Eliot’s pathetic
Oauberon. So are a multitude of ambitious
rhymers who, believing in themselves, make
literary fame their goal, studying, collecting
and experimenting all their lives with words
and phrases, vowel sounds and metres, and
who achieve at last an astonishing output
of highly-wrought, but third-rate verse. There
is no question about the industry of such
men; their work is perfectly finished and
delightful, and it is, of course, well worth
the writing; but it is literary art only.
They are professional word-fanciers, to whom
form is everything, and, like Xavier de
Maistre, they could write with as much
grace and melody about a bedpost as about
perilous seas in faery lands forlorn. That
rara avis, the poet, is more than that, whe-
ther he be as industrious as Shelley or as
idle as Coleridge.
Moreover, the popular definition would
seem to exclude those deathless works of
Michelangelo which he never bothered to
finish—those rough-hewn marble forms in
which the tremendous conception stands out
so strikingly, and which almost any pains-
taking tyro could complete. . I prefer Dry-
den’s dictum: “Genius must be born, and
never can he taught.”
JAMES DEVANEY.
A Satchel of Books
Polly Hedron, by Norman S. Osbourne (H. G.
Foster). A whimsical, entertaining and suggestive
little book. Its pages are rich with literary excerpts,
anecdotes and personal experiences—a pick-up, put-
away, and take-up-again book holding between its
paper covers the gleanings of a lifetime.
A Book of Homely Wisdom, by R. .1. Campbell.
The Rev. R. ,J. Campbell, whose fame as a preacher
once drew crowds to the City Temple. London, but
who has since withdrawn into the relative seclusion
of the Anglican Church (he is incumbent of Holy
Trinity, Brighton), collects a number of recent short
homilies. The book bears witness to the modern
disinclination to take mental food in any but the
homoeopathic dose of the short paragraph. Mr. Camp-
bell does his best to serve this jaded appetite, and
sprinkles his homilies with jest and anecdote. Its
intellectual depth will not call for the expert diver.
Tjipical Australian Scenes, by W. D. Walker
(Adelaide University Magazine). “To dispel some
of tile widespread ignorance concerning our country,”
the author has brought together a collection ol
photos with letterpress illustrating its natural fea-
tures and potentialities. The .work is being pub-
lished in serial form, the present number covering
“Central Australia As Seen To-day,” “A Trip Along
the West Coast of S.A.” and “Where the Sea Once
Was.” The little publication does its job very well.
Advanced Accounts, Australasian edition, edited by
R. .N. Carter, M. Com. F.C.A. By the treatment of
its subject from the Australasian standpoint, this
ponderous book has gained more than academic
interest. Its matter is well arranged and covers
a wide field thoroughly. Designed as a manual for
students, whose wants are largely fashioned by the
requirements of examiners, the volume is a little
theoretical in character. It covers the ground re-
quired in the accounts section of the qualifying exami-
nation for public accountants conducted by the chief
Australian institutes, and has been adopted by Sydney
University’s Economics Faculty as one of its text-
books.
Pearls of Desire, by Austin J. Small (Heine-
mann). “Beware ye the Pearls of Desire, O seekers,”
were the words inscribed on a small square of
black, shrivelled kelp handed to a white adventurer
and his companion by a Polynesian chief in grati-
tude for a service rendered. Provided with this key
the reader can surmise all that follows. On the
scrap of kelp are traced a rough map, rude pictures,
and disconnected hieroglyphics—in short, all the
necessary trappings for a story after the manner,
but without the genius, of “Treasure Island.” The
travesty of diction is painful. One may travel far
and know many degrees of men, yet fail to meet
a human being who speaks like this: “Crack my
toe-nails, cap, but they’re about the durndest brace
o’ ship lice 1 ever clapped eyes on.”
A Year Amongst the Maoris, by Frances Del Mar
(Ernest Benri). ' By an artist of English extraction
who has been working for several American museums.
Her sojourn amongst the Maoris being so short, her
contribution is not of much real value. The book
is illustrated with carefully stage-managed photo-
graphs in which all the traditional properties are
used to obtain an essentially theatrical effect. The
real Henare lives in a tin-roofed whare, attends at
a tin-roofed church, collects his rents from the pakeha
in his own tin Lizzie and joins in the tribe’s tangis
with as much gusto as ever, but with his tongue
in his cheek. He is so little of a museum specimen
that one of his conspicuous activities at the present
moment is reafforestation of the hills of his foio-
fathers that the improvident white man denuded
for his sheep.
The Antiquity of the Aborigines of Australia and
Tasmania, by Georgina King (W. Brooks and Co.).
That the students at Trinity College, Dublin, should
95 years ago have shown a lively interest m the
curious customs and rites of circumcision practised
among the aborigines of Australia comes with a note
of surprise. This interest, however, accounted for the
fact that when the late Rev. George King went to
Fremantle in 1841 he showed a keen curiosity in
learning all he could of the original inhabitants.
After many years of inquiry and observation he came
to the following conclusion: “They appear to have
roamed over the vast plains of Australia at a very
early period of the world’s history. They are not,
however, one unmixed race. From certain physical
peculiarities, as well as from language and habits,
tliev seem to have had an accession to their numbers
at a comparatively recent date, and their tradition,
vague and uncertain as it is, seems to indicate the
North-West as the place whence those latter tribes
broke in upon a people whom we may regard as the
primary aborigines of the bush.” The aggressors on
the soil are supposed to have been the wild black
Dravidians from Southern India, though, prior to this
incursion, the Negritos and Papuans had penetrated
into the continent and become intermingled with the
primitive race. It is to the Dravidians we are sup-
posed to owe the presence of the dingo—-possibly our
first undesirable immigrant. Remains of this native
dog have been found in a fossil state m India.

ELECTRIC LIGHT
and POWER PLANTS
Will Your Lighting Plant Forget?
When the Storage Batteries are exhausted to the point at which their Plates begin to sulphate and
damage themselves, will your Light and Power Plant remember its duty and automatically start its Generator
to recharge the Battery?
When you suddenly switch on an Electric Iron, Electric Motor or large user of current, when a
number of lights are burning, will your Generator automatically start itself and take all the load off the
Battery?
If the load is still too heavy, will your Plant call the Batteries back to work,
so that the Generator and Batteries carry the load?
IF IT WONT IT ISN’T A FULL-AUTOMATIC.
“MATTHEWS’* FULL-AUTOMATIC PLANTS do not depend for their
efficient operation on somebody’s memory. Their “Automatic Caretaker” an
exclusive Matthews feature—automatically starts the Plant to recharge the Batteries
long before they are exhausted to danger point and automatically stops
recharging when the Batteries are full.
A MATTHEWS PLANT NEVER FORGETS.
There is a Matthews Plant for every requirement—Full-Automatic Plants of
300 Watts, 1 K.W., 2 K.W., 3 K.W. and 5 K.W. (13 to 250 Lights).

The Preachers.
Morning from his pulpit
Love of life beseeches,
While the radiant ocean
Hymns along its beaches;
This the golden gospel
That the morning preaches:
“Life is bright and lovely,
Love is sweet and glowing,
Joy is yours forever —
Think not of its going.
Beauty blooms undying,
Ne’er to fade and wither;
In my sunshine seek not
Clouds till they come hither.
“Mark the little fishes
In the golden shallows.
Hark the merry twitter
Of the flashing swallows;
Waste no precious moment
In vain hopes and wishes;
Be ye as the swallows,
Be ye as the fishes!”
Sunset from his pulpit
Preaches hope undying,
While with Avings made rosy
Seabirds homeward flying,
Skim the waves that shoreward
Ripple, softly sighing.
“Though enrobed in glory,
For a space I leave ye,
If ye-but look forward,
Naught on earth shall grieve ye;
Should the black night gather,
Hinting woe and sorrow,
Look, look ever eastward
Towards the golden morrow.
“Mark the little fishes
Sleeping in the shallows;
Hark the good-night twitter
Of the nesting swallows;
Has not day rewarded
All their hopes and wishes?
Be ye as the swallows,
Be ye as the fishes!”

RODERIC QUINN.
The Organ.
The bells are ringing from St. Peter’s tower,
Where ivy clings about the old grey stones.
They cease. The city clock chimes out the
hour.
The faint, sweet discord of the overtones
Still lingers echoing and slowly dies.
The hush within the church is softly stirred.
The bourdon’s deep-toned, vibrant voice is
heard;
The diapasons speak; the flute replies.
The aisles are filled with pulsing wave on
wave
Of sounds that beat and throb against the
walls.
Th.e music rises, swells and slowly falls;
Then sweeps again along the dim-lit nave
And floods the chancel, fills the sanctuary.
From every pipe new loveliness is poured;
In moving melody and Avondrous chord,
It rings rejoicing, sings triumphantly.
The trumpet sounds above the arch’s span,
A ringing call, reverberate and clear;
A splendid challenge falls upon the ear,
The thrilling voice of the cornopean.
Onrushing and resistless as the tide.
The sea of music rises; thunders roll
Their word of inspiration to the soul.
At last the waves tempestuous subside.
The storm is ceasing; faint and fainter
grows
The melody. The ringing reeds are mute.
The stops are silent—dulciana, flute.
The cadences are sweet and low; the close,
Reluctant, tremulous, grows dim and dies.
The last long lovely notes, still lingering,
Float upward on their pearl and silver wing
Towards the silence of the spacious skies.

ETHEL MARTYR.
At Moonrise.
The first man, finding he could stand erect,
Crept from his rocky cavern and looked out
One night to where there hung across the sky
The great and golden circle of the moon.
Black were the fir-trees on the jagged hill,
Black were the valleys where huge monsters
moved,
Grunting and shuffling, hissing in the dark,
Lit here and there by yellow glint of eyes
Or flash of fangs that dripped each other’s
blood.
Half-crouching at the entrance of the cave,
Clutching his weapon in his hairy hand,
With small, red eyes and sagging underlip,
He felt a strangeness stir within his breast
That knew brute love and hunger and hot
thirst,
But had not pulsed before to vague regrets
For some pale Eden of high sentiment
That means not clinging limbs, but fusing
souls.
He saw the moon-bloom on the empty crags,
Breathed the moist perfumes that the moon-
ray found;
He saw it reach the waters like a spear.
Then he wheeled suddenly and, weeping,
sought
The shadow, with his face turned to the wall.
To-night you see the moon across the sands
And wonder if it finds the far-off gloojn
Of some Hy-Brasil that is made of dream.
The heavy scent of coastal box blows down
To spice the shore with sweets. You hear,
beyond
The gum-trees and the whisper of the leaves,
A band that blares out jazz at the hotel;
Yet, with your bridegroom’s kisses on your
mouth,
Clad in y j lr satin gown and fragile shoes,
You ache t > wander through the thorny bush
By some lone crag to watch the moon alone,
And know not why your eyes are blind with
tears.

A QUIET DAY WITH THE TARIFF
BOARD.
The Australian Tarrying Board, sometimes
miscalled the Tariff Board, had the woollen
industrv brought under its languid notice
the other day. Vicars, of Sydney, who
has for years employed well-paid Aus-
tralian skilled labor in making Australian
clothes for Australian people , out of Aus-
tralian wool, raised the question by asking
for an increased duty. His plea, which no-
body contradicted so far as the report showed,
was that 40 per oent. of the local looms —
and there aren’t many—are now idle, which
means that a corresponding proportion of
workers are idle likewise. The complaint
isn’t quite new, for of late the closing down
or partial closing down of mills has been a
scandal, while the idea of any present expan-
sion of what should be a wool-producing
country’s national industry has become an
inferior kind of joke. It looks a better invest-
ment to buy a drought-stricken farm with
any spare money, and use it for breeding
slow racehorses. Australia has to compete
against woollens made by cheaper labor in
Britain, and brought here under a tariff which
is made specially cheap as a sign of good-
will to J. Bull, who doesn’t reciprocate to
any extent worth screaming about. It also
has to compete, pending the much-delayed
reform of the infamous preference device,
against goods which are 75 per cent, the
product of countries with which Britain
itself finds competition difficult, but which
come under the low tariff because the train
stopped at J. Bull’s station on the way
here. The scheme works so badly for us,
however it may work for the other party to
the bargain, that, while the Cold Country
takes much less than half our wool and re-
sells in its raw state much of what it does
take, it purports to make about 99 J per
cent, of our imported woollen stuffs—at least
about that proportion is called British, and
comes in under a low tariff accordingly. In
addition Australian products which are wool,
partly because we have never grown much
of anything to adulterate with, are exposed
to the fierce competition of cheap-labor and
preferential-tariff articles which look like
wool —look so like it that the importer or
some minor middleman may be able to pass
them off as the genuine thing, to the serious
damage of Australian industry. In the
matter of the strange lop-sidedness of trade,
the latest statistics for N.S.W. (1922-23)
show these results, the Ma State being taken
as an example because it is the greatest wool-
grower, and because its figures are handiest:
N.S.W. Wool, Greasy and Scoured (1922-23).
Exported to Britain .. £7,730,115
Exported to Foreign Lands 15,034,448
And, on the other hand, taking the first half-
dozen headings, all on one page of the
Statistical Register, which deals with
woollen piece goods (not apparel), these
remarkable results are arrived at: —
Bought ostensibly from Britain.. .. £1,879,798
Bought from other countries .. .. 34,620
These figures hint at the extent to which
Britain has become a mere agent for passing
Hun and other strange wares on to this
country, and at the extent to which strangers
profit at the cost of Australian industry
through this country’s desire to be good to
the Old Man in London. It is questionable
if any mere reduction in the percentage of
foreign work which may legally go into pre-
ferential-tariff and allegedly-British goods
will meet the case.
# * * *
The Tarrying Board, having heard the
application, was promptly rushed by an-
other class of witness. This kind didn’t
use Australian raw materials, nor did it
employ skilled Australian labor, nor very
much Australian labor of any sort. The
report was something after this fashion: —
Mr. Blank, representing Brown & Briggs, ware-
housemen, opposed the application. His firm were
large importers of English goods.. . .The present duty
of 30 per cent, ad valorem was, in his opinion, suffi-
cient protection for Australian goods.
Mr. Hank, manufacturers’ agent, also opposed the
application for increased duty.
Then the matter was hung up, or automati-
cally hung itself up, for the Tarrying Board
is not given to haste in matters of this sort.
It is the kind of fire brigade which enters
on its deliberations after the fire is reported,
and is beginning to make some headway
with its report when the ashes are cold.
Importers and the agents of foreign manu-
facturers are much more numerous than
Australian woollen-mill proprietors, and
they naturally incline to regard the latter
as nuisances who interfere with oversea
trade. It may be taken as said and as read
that they consider the Australian maker suf-
ficiently protected, and that they would con-
sider him protected quite enough even if he
wasn’t protected at all. The question arises
why such persons should give evidence at
all, any more than a German general should
address the House of Commons on the suf-
ficiency, or even the redundancy, of the
British army and navy. Australian industry
has a right to be heard on tariff matters,
and so has the Australian consumer, who
can make himself vocal per medium of his
member if he thinks industry is taking too
much out of him. But the right of the
representative of foreign interests to talk at
large is highly problematical.
* * * *
When any person who is interested in the
anti-Australian side of the case, and is a
large importer of English goods, throws in
his unsupported assertion that the tariff on
such an industry as the making of Australian
woollens is sufficient, he should be asked for
reasons and details. For example:—
Does he mean that it is enough to keep the
existing mills going? If so, why are so many of
them not going, or only half going?
• If he means that it is enough to keep existing
mills going, which obviously isn’t the case whether
he means it or not, why shouldn’t Australia have
an ambition for stacks more mills? It is an honest
ambition even if it makes the large importer of
English goods as obsolete as the Greek hoplite. There
being a long way to go, an early start is advisable.
For 1922-3, which is as far as the manufacturing
statistics have travelled, the imports of woollen piece
goods and woollen yarn alone exceeded by nearly
£2,000,000 the gross output of the Commonwealth’s
woollen, cotton and tweed mills, which are all lumped
together. That was wretchedly unsatisfactory, and
it was before the slump. The precise dimensions
of the slump haven’t been put into figures yet, but
these two things are known: During the latter half
of 1924 imports were some £5,000,000 more than
in the last half of 1923, and the local unemployed,
not counting persons on strike or locked out, were
16,899 mote at the end of 1924 than at the end of
1923. The loss of work was mainly concentrated in
N.S.W. and Victoria, where 89 per cent, of the
woollen industry is located, so the 40 per cent, of
looms which have ceased to revolve are partly
responsible.
And, even if the existing Protection was enough,
instead of being absurdly inadequate, why should
Australia be satisfied with just enough any more
than a large importer of English goods is content
with just enough to live on—a basic wage, in fact?
It is good to have a margin of security, and a broad
one.
The Commonwealth’s unfinished and unsatis-
factory rulers had their one and only burst
of velocity when they fixed up an arrange-
ment with Canada whereby the worst cus-
tomer we have is to secure an increased
advantage. All. ost everything with which it
doesn’t already swamp our markets is to
come in at reduced rates or no rates at all,
and in return it puts our beeswax on the
free list. But in the way of doing something
for an. Australian industry, or enforcing
Australian law against truculent imported
revolutionists who stop Australian industry,
the Cabinet is weak to the point of death
and scared to the verge of tears. So the
woollen business is living for the time on
hope, that being the chief victual in sight.
WOMAN.
European beginnings as we are now able
to trace them indicate the somewhat start-
ling fact that the place of women in the
tribes was higher three thousand years ago
than it is to-day. The Athenian woman of
the upstairs room does not appear as of
very great consequence in the time of
Pericles, and the most interesting female
person to arise in Greece in two or three of
the most important centuries would seem to
be PnRYNE, a courtesan; but the fact re-
mains that in the ranks of the greater deities
there are three goddesses who are more than
equal to any except the chief god. Also the
seventh century n.c. saw the glory of the
woman Sappho, by full Greek acknowledg-
ment the greatest lyric-poet of the race. So
the inference clearly is that early Greece
thought more of women than later Greece.
In Rome, from first to last, woman held a
high place; but it is when we turn to Gaul
that we find her on a fully-acknowledged
equality—even entering the field of battle
at her husband’s side. In Britain we find
a woman leading the great national revolt;
and in Ireland, where ancient European
thought continued longest, Masve, Queen of
Connaught, is the rival of the greatest legen-
dary kings, and the gods themselves are
described as the children of their mother,
not their father. The lower place accorded
to woman through the long European Middle
Ages is due to two influences —those of Asia
and of the Germanic peoples.
* ■» * #
Christianity—in its first shape an Asiatic
religion—naturally lowered the standing of
woman; yet Europe added its contribution
to that religion in exalting the Virgin Mother.
In the New Testament —a series of Asiatic
writings in inferior Greek —there is not the
smallest indication of any exalted regard for
Mary, the mother of Christ ; but Europe
could not do without a woman in the pan-
theon, and, if not actually raised to deity,
Mary became the chief pleader with deity
for mankind. It is interesting to note that
the very lands which at the so-called Refor-
mation swept away the worship of Mary
were those in which the original German
blood was strongest. Still, the influence
of Asia through Christianity was very great,
and remains great even to this day. There are
women living among us afraid to follow the
current fashion and wear short hair because
of the injunction of the Asiatic Paul, who
declared that a yard or two of mane was
woman’s glory, and so elevated the scissors
into the realm of religious thought. For
many Christian ages the only women pro-
minent in history—with the exception of a
few accidental queens—were saints and
criminals. Holiness and crime were, in fact,
the only careers open to women; no place
could be found for them in the councils of
war or peace, nor could they gain a footing
in art or science. Yet the modern elevation
of woman and the gradual breaking-down of
all barriers against her was not so much a
new movement as a partial return to an
older and fairer system. The passing-out of
Asiatic influence, formerly exerted through
religion, and the gradual diffusion and
tliinning-out of Germanic blood left the way
open, and woman naturally began to come
back to her own. Yet in this return it is
to be noted that progress was delayed by
certain pretences of exalting women which
were a cheap legacy from the so-called ages
of chivalry. A pretended chivalry made a
great deal of woman’s physical weakness,
and affected to treat her always as a deli-
cate child, while allowing her little liberty
and recognising none of her qualities of real
strength. The later contention of some philo-
sophers that the unit in citizen life is the
family, and that the family should be repre-
sented by its natural head, whether male or
female, is too far removed from practical
things to be of much value as a contribution
to the discussion of the question. The safest
line would appear to be the granting of full
citizen equality, regardless of sex, and the
leaving of questions of greater and smaller
to solve themselves in the actual working.
* * * *
But the movements- of humanity arc often
quite independent of the outward political
and social showing of things. Because every
man has a mother and the years of early
home life are the most important of all in
shaping the future, there has never been
a moment when the influence of woman has
slackened. The woman looked after the
stone-age camp much as she has ever since
looked after the home. The man became a
mighty hunter with fierce regard for his own
share of things; the woman an intense
divider of the spoil, eager that the weakest
should share with the strongest. The two
lines of endeavor ran parallel for thousands
oi years and are not yet blended in the lower
races of mankind. The indications are that
Europe had passed the crude hunting and
dividing stage when its genuine white man
first glimmered in the early light of authen-
tic history. Already both men and women
were winners of bread and both were dividers.
That is to say, the hunting age of chance
eating and precarious living had so long
passed into an age of settled agriculture and
certainty for the morrow that, in the natural
course of progress, the separate tribal and
family duties of the sexes no longer existed.
The man and woman were mates, equals,
sharing each other’s thoughts and challeng-
ing each other to nobler endeavor. It was no
barren courtesy to the weak which the Euro-
pean exhibited to his women, but the full
respect of equality for one who was his com-
panion even in the occasional struggle of
war. Out of an increasing natural desire for
the good of a larger number grew all the
possibilities of democracy; and on it is based
all the hope of the modern world. Social
progress is, in fact, a feminine thing in its
origin, though the loss of woman’s status
for 16 or 17 centuries has left its voice and
guidance largely to men. The harshnesses and
cruelties of the world belong to the masculine-
hunter scheme of life; the softening refine-
ment of kindly deeds and gracious thoughts
comes from a feminine spring. Perhaps it
was a man who first realised the stars; but
it was a woman who pointed out to him
the stars in a child’s eves. The great truth
behind the whole feminist movement is that
men need the assistance of women in the
bigger things of life as well as the smaller
and that that assistance has been too long
absent. To dismiss such assistance on the
ground that women have so far done little
in politics is absurd. They have been 60
generations out of practice and can hardly
be expected to strike form at once.
NATURAL RESOURCES OF ERIN.
Dear Bulletin, —The world has learned,
through many collections, and many allusions
to the potato famine of 1847 and the exo-
dus which ensued, to regard Ireland as a
poor land by nature and a born child of
misfortune. As any information —even a
reliable item about Banquo’s Ghost if it
could be obtained —is worth having, the mat-
ter may repay investigation.
The Irish Free State is more than half as
large again and yet not quite twice as large
as Denmark or Switzerland, and it has less
population than either of these naturally
poor agricultural regions, so it is far from
overcrowded. The whole island was well
peopled in 1547. when the population, for
some reason difficult to explain, had grown
to more than three times that of Scotland,
and at that time the potato was almost the
only national occupation. But the popula-
tion has been reduced one-half, and the Irish-
man, like the Jew. and probably the English-
man, lives mostly abroad, and the unreliable
potato isn’t now a patch on the oat crop, and
threatens to be overtaken by the turnip in
Ireland’s agricultural economy. In fact, as
it covers only about 10 per cent, of the culti-
vated space, a potato failure should be a
mere fraction as serious for Erin’s Isle as
a wheat failure here. Wheat stands for three-
fifths of Australia’s cultivated area, and it
does a dramatic collapse often enough. Irish
crop statistics are rather disjointed, but as
late as 1918 the returns for the whole Three
Kingdoms were clear enough. This was how
Ireland’s output showed up against the com-
parative sterility of England and Wales—a
region with four times the Distressed Isle’s
density of population to support. Austra-
lia’s figures are thrown in as far as avail-
able :

Ireland is a good first in everything except
potatoes, and Australia is, save once, a bad
last. It seems a pity that the failure of
one minor crop, said to be due to seven
weeks’ rain, should have brought the collect-
ing hat so far from a fertile land to one of
comparative (in some times and places, of
superlative) sterility. In the one year
1923-24, though the tumult caused by the
wild attempt to make a throne for Emilio
De Valera had hardly died down, the Irish
Free State sold £44,000.000 worth of pro-
duce to England, Scotland and Northern Ire-
land alone, and it hopes to do better if the
patriots don’t resume house-burning and
ambushing. Combustible patriots are the
devil to pay.
The Irish Free State is, roughly speaking,
the same size as Tasmania, one-fourteenth
the size of South Australia, and one-thirty-
seventh that of Westralia. And its culti-
vated space of 3,832.219 acres (latest figures)
is over 12 times that of Tasmania, and very
much greater than that of either S.A. or
Westralia. To put it another way. Westralia,
South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania
possess 76 times as much land as Free-State
Ireland, and have much less than twice the
acreage under crop, and they secure crops
that range from poor to miserable per acre
by comparison.. So far as natural gifts are
concerned it is no slouch of an agricultural
Free State which can put so much of its area
under the plough with sucli consistently good
results. And from the pastoral _ point of
view the Free State is no slouch either. It
is still mostly a grass land, including over
8 060 000 acres of real pasture. _ and over
2.000.000 acres of “grazed mountain.” There
is some waste, but very little. According to
latest available returns the distressed
Dominion was possessed of the following:—
Cattle — 4,326,494. This exceeded by a considerable
margin all the cattle in Victoria, South Australia,
Westralia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and
the Federal Capital area put together. (Last com-
plete returns are for 1922.)
5heep —3,067,473. This isn’t so good a showing,
but the number is about double that of Tasmania,
the Northern Territory and the Canberra area, and
it is about half the number S. Australia can show.
Pigs —919,449. In 1920 the whole Commonwealth
owned 764,606 recognised and admitted swine, and
the latest figures at command were 985,930.. Appa-
rently the Irish Free State is about as rich in swine
as Australia and Tasmania combined.
Horses, Mules and Asses —The Irish Free State is
credited with 776,368 of these animals. The
horses alone almost equal those of S. Australia and
Westralia put together.
Taking one consideration with another it is
no poor catalogue. The Irish farmer, in about
two-thirds of the instances, is his own land-
lord. The tenant farmer, under British legis-
lation, has been protected by a Fair Rents
Court for over 40 years, and every revision
by the Court (there have been three) has
brought about solid reduction. Eviction is
almost too complicated to be worth trying.
The comparative backwardness of manufac-
tures in the South (not in the North) has
been set down to the lack of coal, though
certain deposits exist, and are very little
worked. But even if coal had to be almost
entirely imported it is a very common case,
and nothing to lament about. The supply in
the west of Scotland and in Wales is only a
few hours away. Victoria grew to be the
greatest manufacturing centre of Australia
under worse conditions as to distance from
its fuel supply, and S. Australia built up
big factories in still harder circumstances
than Victoria’s. Denmark, Holland, Spain.
Italy, Argentina and other countries have a
coal problem always with them. The Free
State has a better climate than adjacent
Britain, has a reliable rainfall, fine harbors,
and the best rivers in the British Isles. There-
fore many people would like to know what it
wants with a famine; also liow such a Speck
thinks it can afford a famine while it pays
its Speck Governor-General £IO.OOO a year,
its High Chief Justice £SOOO. its two Supreme
Judges £4OOO each, and its five High Judges
£3500 each. If the famine rests on any
definite and detailed evidence, that ought to


be produced. It may be. to some extent,
merely a condition of mind arising from the
confirmed liat-passing habit. —Yours, etc.,
Henry Hoiisecollar.
THE TALE OF TOM CRABTREE.
Tom Crabtree is a native of Victoria, a
tall, wiry bushman with stubbornness and
tenacity inherited from a Yorkshire parent-
age. lie belongs to the type Conan Doyle
drew in “Micah Clarke,” and doubtless there
were Crabtrees among the men who pre-
faced battle with loud Nonconformist hymns
and pitchforked or scythed their
when they could reach them —rather in
sorrow than in anger, but effectually. Such
men are sometimes referred to in respectable
newspapers as “The backbone of the
Empire.” They are usually lean, religious
and industrious, and often unnecessarily
earnest in their views, especially on the use
of alcohol (this one is a Rechabite) and the
correct length for skirts. At the age of
15 Tom Crabtree had the misfortune to
lose his left hand in a gun accident. As a
substitute he invented a combined iron and
leather sheath with a series of hooks and
eyes, adaptable to such tools as bushmen
use: with these he has managed passably
well for 48 years.
The drought of 1902 drove Tom Crabtree
out of the Malice. He came to East Gipps-
land, and in 1903 took up a selection of 488
acres, known hereinafter as the Mueller
block. The nearest settlement was 25 miles
away. Tom Crabtree and his brother
Arthur, who had acquired an adjacent area,
packed their supplies of flour, tea, sugar
and mutton this distance when necessary,
and went on with the work of making Gipps-
land safe and comfortable for the Victorian
Lands Department. About 1904 Mary,
Tom’s wife (they had one child then; there
are three more now), took up 254 acres on
Wingan River, about 20 miles from the
Mueller. The Wingan area was poor com-
pared with the Mueller block, but was nearer
to civilisation, “civilisation” in this case
meaning a bark hut, four miles off a bush
track, where a rattle-trap coach carried a
mail once a week. The family idea was to
dwell a little nearer to “civilisation” and
subdue the better but more distant area at
the same time.
For years one-handed Tom Crabtree kept
the rents and rates on Wingan duly paid,
and struggled to establish a home in the
heart of East Gippsland. But the battle
proved too hard. Flour must be bought, and
tea, and sometimes sugar, and one cannot
go entirely naked, even in the uttermost
bush. On application to the late J. E.
Mackey, then Minister of Lands — Tom
always refers to him as “a gentleman”—
the Mueller holding was altered from an
agricultural to a grazing area, which meant
that the payments were decreased 2d. per
acre per annum. Thus relieved, the Crab-
trees hung it out for another year; but it
was a year of bad luck. Tom fell into arrears
with his instalments on the Mueller block,
a matter of about £l5. and received notice
of forfeiture. The following year bringing
him a little turn of fortune, he offered to
pay the arrears, only to be frigidly informed
that it was too late—the title had been can-
celled.
Toai and Mary perforce now confined their
Empire-building enthusiasms for some years
to the Wingan block. Getting very short of
money, they went to work here and there,
keeping their rents paid and complying with
the conditions, and hoping to get back some
day to the dear old bush things that Henry
Lawson can make you cry over when he is
at his best. There was a local settler, who,
despite the “superior” Victorian system of
setting people on the land, had followed many
Gippslanders to Northern N. S. Wales. He
wrote for the Crabtrees to come over. What
he said about the Victorian Lands Depart-
ment cannot be repeated here, hi ary and
her growing family followed the flag to a
land which has added a Page to history,
leaving Tom to pay the rents on the Wingan
block, still held in her name, and to go on
with the improvements. Then something
happened—something that the system had
perhaps been hoping for. Whether Mary
found life among the little colony of Vic-
torian refugees at Murwillumbah too bright
a contrast with the heart-breaking struggle
in Gippsland and became temporarily indif-
ferent to the Wingan block, or the post mis-
carried—her address for Lands Department
papers was to be Mallacoota West (Vic.) —is
not clear to me yet. At all events, Toai
knocked at my door one in-coming mail night
and told me, with grief, wrath and indigna-
tion written on his honest face, that the
bureaucrats had, without notice, declared
the Wingan block forfeit because lie owed
the Government a whole £3. He had seen
the item in a newspaper, and wanted to
go and take it out of somebody’s hide. He
shipped on an out-going cutter next day
and went to Melbourne. There, after Taper
had conferred with Tadpole, and Tadpole
with Blindworai, and Blindworai with
Barnacle, and the Tapers, Tadpoles, Bar-
nacles and BLiNDWORArs had inspected and
dissected the File, the Gippslander was told
that he might apply to re-select the Wingan
block. Apply he did early in 1918, before
he left Melbourne.
The application, like many more of its
kind, became a plaything for the jesters of
the Department. It was tossed from one
dull office to another in senseless sport. The
dreary and unprofitable game ivent on until
the end of 1920. when Donald Mackinnon,
then Assistant-Minister for Lands, came to
Mallacoota on a holiday. Acting on my
advice, Tom Crabtree approached the good-
natured Donald, who applied the acid to
such purpose that ToAr was granted permis-
sion to re-select the block provided he paid
up the £3 arrears. This he agreed to do.
But the Lords of Redtape bided their time
until the member for Prahran had been put
to sleep at a general election. Then they in-
formed the one-armed victim of Victorian
land legislation that he would have to pay
the £l5 “owing” on the Mueller selection
■which had been forfeited 12 or 13 years be-
fore, although he had offered to square up
soon after forfeiture and had been turned
away. And, notwithstanding that Crabtree
will have no right, title or interest in the
Mueller block, the £l5 has been extracted
by the anti-settlement gang. Yet, while this
genuine home-builder has been relentlessly
harried by the Satraps of Sealingwax and
bled without shame, another man operating
in the same district was allowed to take
up and survey block after block, to be a
selector and a Crown Lands bailiff at the
same time, to light fires with the depart-
mental requests for rent, and to remain in
possession of holdings declared forfeit to
the end of his life.
I have attended Millions Club functions
and political feeds. I have heard men who
hardly knew the difference between Magna
Charta and the Habeas Corpus Act talk elo-
quently about “the necessity for peopling
this continent with men and women of the
good old British stock.” Here is an Aus-
tralian settler of British stock, one of those
Gippslanders of the Eastern Division among
whom I have lived for 12 years, and who
are as fine a type as you can get anywhere.
See what encouragement lie has received.
Now, what is going to be done with that
Department?

Sydney Worker, which used to be regarded
as pro-Moscow, came out the other day
with a crushing indictment of the Commu-
nist party on the score of its “criminally
stupid doctriiie of violence” and other
sentiments “alien to Australian ways of
thinking, and grotesquely incongruous amidst
Australian conditions.” There was one
specially significant paragraph :
The Australian workers have- nothing whatever of
the revolutionary temper. They don’t want to have
Capitalism overthrown in any sudden and dramatic
fashion. They are perfectly content to see its worst
features eliminated, or even toned down. .. .Palliatives
and the Arbitration Court are in complete accord
with their mental make-up. Even the most militant
unions fight against deregistration.
All perfectly true, and a noteworthy recan-
tation withal. Hitherto the “advanced”
Labor theory has been that the Australian
workers were class-conscious wage-slaves
gaining momentum for an inevitable rising
against the “master class.” This mad idea
dominated the 1921 Trades Union Congress,
which was infested with imported doctrin-
aires. And even the Worker applauded
when the Congress counselled the wage-
earners to “unite in one class-conscious
organisation and take and hold the means
of production by revolutionary industrial and
political action.” What the recipients of
the counsel would gain by acting upon it
was not outlined by the Congress, nor lias
it been indicated since. Next to the heavily-
protected workers of the “capitalistic” North
American Republic, they receive the highest
wages in the world. Though the population
is not (>,000,000 there are approximately
8,000,000 savings-bank accounts, the deposits
being in the neighborhood of £200,000,000.
There are friendly societies with 520 000
benefit members, and a revenue of, roughly,
£2,500,000 p.a. There are assurance
offices with 800,000 policies in the
life department, and 1,100,000 in the
industrial branch; their Australian assets
are valued at £85,000,000. and their
income has reached £13,500.000 p.a.
And although the worker hasn’t taken
as kindly to co-operative trading as he might
have done considering the cost of living
and the plight of many small producers
who would jump at the chance of getting in
touch with organised bodies of consumers,
there were at the latest computation 152 such
societies with 110.000 members and capital
amounting to £1,500,000. In the latest year
recorded by H. A. Smith, N.S.W. Statistician
and Registrar of Co-operative Societies, a
trade profit of £52,543 was shown by a Cess-
nock enterprise, while a Ivurri Kurri under-
taking had a profit of £52.253 and a Lith-
gow affair one of £44,660. The same Smith
states in his Official Year Book that
“approximately one half of the private dwel-
lings in N! S. Wales are occupied
by owners or prospective owners pur-
chasing by instalments,” and other
States can' show a still higher propor-
tion. If the revolutionaries had their way
the privately-owned houses, the life-assur-
ance, co-operative and friendly societies and
the 3,000,000 savings-bank accounts would
all go into the melting-pot of “socialisation”
with everything else. Again, the executives
of big federated unions have a calling power
that the directors of most Australian joint-
stock companies might envy. A. C. Willis,
president of the N. S. Wales A.L.P., lias
made the remarkable admission that levies
to the amount of £248,996 were paid in 1923
by a section of his Miners’ Federation, which
has branches in only three States, for the
support of “comrades” on strike. The
A.W.U. owns a Sydney building valued at
£150,000, and lost £30,000 in one of its
newspapers without turning a hair. This
union claims to have 107,000 members, and
reckoning each member’s earnings at £213
p.a., which is slightly less than the N. S.
Wales basic wage (many pastoral workers
earn considerably more), the wages of the
whole body pan out at £22,791,000 p.a., or
nearly seven per cent, of the wealth pro-
duced in 1921-22 = £346,662.000, according to
the estimate of Commonwealth Statistician
Wickens. Australian affairs would wear a
very different aspect if these great organisa-
tions, instead of proceeding on the theory
that the Revolution would arrive shortly had
gone in resolutely for industrial banks, as in
America, for co-operative societies of con-
sumers working in with kindred enterprises
among the farmers, and for constitutional
measures designed to give the deserving wage-
earner a feeling of security, the lack of
which constitutes his main grievance against
the present social order. It is a grievance
which it is not beyond the wit of Australians
to remedy. National insurance is one ex-
pedient that suggests itself, or there might
be an extension of the N. S. Wales system of
giving subventions to friendly societies, and
most Australians would supnort the
principle that a man who has been
many years in the service of one employer
should be protected by the State against
capricious and uncompensated dismissal —
that there ought to be some industrial
equivalent of tenant-right as regards a job.
Perhaps the Worker’s change of front may
be interpreted to mean that the greatest of
Australian unions has come round to a frame
of mind in which constructive things may
be done for the workers and for Australia.
The Unmarried Mother.
A woman lawyer discusses the question:—
Rita Coghlan (B. 19/2/’25) asks why a woman
should be denied the right to bear children merely
because she cannot attract a marrying man. The
answer is that she isn’t. The unmarried woman can
have as many children as the married—she frequently
has more. An advertisement inserted in the daily
papers that a woman is desirous of becoming an
unmarried mother would probably bring more answers
than an advertisement that a competent general wanted
a job at low wages with no days off.
But that is not really what Rita Coghlan wants;
she wants the unmarried to be free to have children
at someone else’s expense. For though she touches
lightly on the fact, the child of the unmarried
mother usually has a father. And it is not always
true that he is not a marrying man; sometimes
he is thoroughly married. But, if he is not a
marrying man, it is probably because he prefers
somebody else to feed, and clothe, and love, and
bath and train and educate and skelp his children
rather than take on these onerous duties himself.
And it is not clear just why unmarried parents
should be immune from the responsibility which
rests upon the married of supporting their off-
spring. A married man is hard enough put to it
these days to support his own children without being
taxed more to support, in addition, the unmarried
man’s children; and even Rita Coghlan would
hardly suggest a tax on childless old maids to sup-
port the children of those whose maternal (and
paternal) instincts are strong enough to do every-
thing except rear their children by their own effort.
Under this benign system, one would have a Gov-
ernment department for the support of what I
persist in regarding as the children of the unmarried
fathers.
With wowserish inconsistency Rita Cogiilan
objects to free love. Why ? And just what is the
distinction between free love and “the right of
any woman to become a mother without saddling
herself with the encumbrance of a husband” ? She
seems to suggest that a statute of limitations
should restrict the number of illegitimate children
to five. Again, why this arbitrary curtailment of
“the greatest national asset”? It would appear
that Convention, and Law, and Morality and the
Church are to be scrapped only to be superseded
by the dictates of Rita Cogiilan, who, by the way,
is a very poor advocate of the rights of women, for,
while she would fix a limit “to prevent its being
a business” (presumably with women), she has no
practical suggestion to prevent its becoming a
business with men.
At present, far more is done for the unmarried
mother than for the married mother who is bringing
up her children with continuous self-denial—scandal-
ously more, one is sometimes inclined to think.
Yet it is riglit that the unmarried mother, should
be helped, for she is one of life’s proved incompe-
tents. She frequently has no maternal instinct
whatever—only a sex instinct, which is widely
different; and “those who interest themselves in
the welfare of others” are too frequently discouraged
by her readiness to hapd her baby over to the
first comer. There are, of course, gallant exceptions.
The unmarried mother does not usually think;
she acts on impulse. The unmarried father is at
best a drifter and a shirker, at worst a blackguard,
sometimes a dupe. But to do them justice, neither
of them make the preposterous claims for them-
selves that the more emotional of their champions
make for them. The case cited of the old spinster’s
death “surrounded by hoards of notes and gold”
suggests that the problem is not wholly economic.
And it may be doubted if Parliament will be
able to legislate so that the unmarried mother will
be socially “received,” or to prevent her being
morally despised by those who think sex promiscuity
morally despicable. It is doubtful if the word
“bastards” will ever be legislated out of the dic-
tionary ; and if it is, will not some symbol be
invented to indicate the distinction between a child
born in wedlock and a child born out of it, by
those who respect the difference as something vital
and not merely arbitrary?
In short, what Rita Coghlan demands is that
the unmarried mother, and, more still, the unmarried
father, should have all the advantages of the
married without their responsibilities. She claims
for them, as well as complete financial immunity,
the respect given to those who are willing to
subordinate their casual impulses to the welfare of
home and children, and then clamors for the sanction
of religion which she contemns, and the recognition
of laws which she affects to despise.
Nature, she asserts, is older than law and religion,
and she suggests that we should scrap religion and law
and go back to nature. It is arguable whether nature
is older than religion and law; but if it is, and ipso
facto more admirable, why hasn’t Rita Cogiilan the
courage of her opinions ? Why does she not go
clad in a ’possum skin, and knock over her goanna
with a stone, and toast it before a fire made by
rubbing two sticks together? She would then
probably be an unmarried mother to her heart’s
content once her soul-mate’s club had fallen upon
her. But, like many of her contemporaries, she
doubtless combines with blackfellow theories of mor-
ality a preference for meals at first-class restaurants.
But perhaps we are misjudging the blackfellow.
Even amongst them a lady whose return to nature
was too untrammelled might get her head split
open with a tomahawk.

The Department for the Prevention of
Railways.
At long last the N. S. Wales Public Works
Committee has neglected to turn down a
proposal for a railway in the northern part
of the State. Yet there are redeeming fea-
tures in the case of the proposed Inverell-
Ashford dead-end extension, and it isn’t the
outrage on precedent that might be sup-
posed. In fact, it is strictly in keeping. This
is a condensed view of the situation:—
Inverell is at the dead end of a railway which runs
due east for 96 miles and then stops. It has stopped
for 22 years, so it is accustomed to stopping. It
doesn’t pay, but then dead-enders have that habit.
The inhabitants want their line extended further
east, to join with the main Sydney-Brisbane route
at Glen Innes. The distance from Inverell to Glen
Innes and the main route is 42 miles by road. By
the existing railway arrangements, which the inhabit-
ants regard as unsatisfactory, the distance between
the two places is 422 miles: difference 380 miles.
The extension to Glen Innes would bring Inverell 44
miles nearer to Sydney than it is. But the Inverell-
Glen Innes extension might develop into a short
route to some northern port, and a majority of the
P.W. Committee says “No” with monotonous
emphasis. Sometimes it says that any line pointing
towards the coast would probably fail to pay. Some-
times it doesn’t trouble even to say that. The atti-
tude in the matter of the 60-miles extension required
to connect the dead-end at Bombala with Twofold
Bay is similar.
But the same P.W. Committee has opened its heart
and assented to a proposal to build a line 35 or
40 miles long from Inverell, in a northerly or slightly
north-westerly direction (in other words, away from
the sea), to a new dead end at Ashford. That town,
or townlet, will then have the blessing and advantage
of railway communication with the metropolis by
a line about 545 miles in length, running 35 or 4(1
miles south, then 96 miles west (in other words,
away from Sydney), then 60 miles due south, and
after that in a generally south-easterly direction to
Newcastle, whereupon the rest of the journey is
south, with a slight trend to the west. Ashford, like
Inverell, is about 140 miles from a port as the
crow goes, but that port isn’t Sydney.
The Ashford dead-end line is set down in advance
as a probable money-loser, and an addition to the
money-losing capacity of the Moree-Inverell branch,
of which it is to be a crooked or dog’s-hind-leggisl)
addition. So long as a line leads nowhere in par-
ticular, a loss doesn’t matter much. The scheml
represents the same effort to change the subject ai
was made when it was decided to build from the
Goulburn-Bombala railway westward to nowhere in-
stead of finishing it south-easterly to a deep-water
port. These and many similar gyrations are attri-
buted in great measure to the Upper House life-
members of the P.W. Committee. They have no
constitutents to throw them out, and they are mostly
Sydney men, selected as such for convenience in
attending to their unpaid duties.
The N. S. Wales railway system has already
become a joke, with its perpetual accretion
of cockspurs, stumps and dead-ends, which
finish at places like Bull Plain and Sandy
Hollow, and it doesn’t improve on acquaint-
ance. Its chief visible purpose now is to
prevent any new centre arising which may
relieve the pressure on Sydney, that great
metropolis of narrow, crooked thoroughfares,
where the housing problem is intense and
the smash of the petrol-driven vehicle is an
hourly occurrence. The voluminous Hop-
man recently borrowed the car of the New
States Commission for some days, and har-
angued it to the effect, that big States are
good things because Canada has them and
is in no apparent haste to change. But in
Canada the railways don’t as a rule belong
to the State, and it has no overwhelming
cities like Sydney and Melbourne with a
Railway Prevention party at each to hinder
the development of its outports. Nothing
could more fully prove the need of New
States than this —that stodgy men come up
periodically from the big city, to tell the
local inhabitants of places like the Northern
Rivers that they can’t have the means of
communication they want, whether at their
own expense or anybody else’s expense, by
public enterprise or private enterprise or
any other enterprise.

Big Thoughts.
Some months ago Labor held an inter-State
meeting to rehabilitate its Federal platform,
and the mixed conclusions arrived at were
lately got into shape and print. The results
give large support to the belief that, though
the rank and file are swinging away from
Communism, political Labor is still being
“white-anted” by the foreign revolution-and-
confiscation party. Thus one feature of the
programme consists of the to
“nationalise” insurance; to make, a “na-
tional monopoly” of insurance, “including
sick, accident, life and unemployment”;
and to “nationalise monopolies.” Now,
anything may be a monopoly which is de-
clared so, brewing being at present the mono-
poly of the brewers, and saw-milling of the
saw-millers. Further, the idea of taking over
the great mutual life offices, has certainly
nothing to do with the abolition of monopo-
lies and capitalism, for concerns which every
person can enter and own and control on the
same terms as every other person represent
socialism in its purest form. The list, of pro-
jected happenings also includes more naviga-
tion laws, more arbitration laws, more Com-
monwealth ships, more workmen’s compensa-
tion and the “endowment of motherhood.”
This last is understood to mean an allowance
for every child until it reaches the self-
supporting age. The bill for this would be
the biggest feature in the national budget,
yet nothing is said about the finding of the
wherewithal. “Endowment of motherhood”
is simple enough, and “repayment of the
public debt” would be even simpler on the
same condition, and would involve much less
complicated book-keeping. Borrowing is to
be restricted, but it doesn’t appear whether
it is to be restricted to the present average
amount, or half the present amount, or be
fixed at twice the present amount and re-
stricted to that. In defence matters it is pro-
posed that the army shall be a volunteer force,
which will elect its own officers, undergo no
severe or intensive training, be under no
severe discipline, and will take its Weapons
home with it when the soldier retires into
private life, so that the reservist may be
armed at the public expense ready for the
day of revolution. The plan may be sum-
marised as one to provide a Communist army
(the enthusiastic volunteering of the “prole-
tariat” is taken for granted), with Communist
officers, and an armed Communist reserve,
but no national reserve. No explanation has
ever been supplied for the intense desire
that the reservist should have his weapons
at home, where the baby and the hysterical
wife and the intoxicated lodger can get at
them, save that, with them in the house,
the insurrection could be made a much more
complete surprise than if each insurgent had
to make his way to a possibly distant arsenal,
and ask for his apparatus. White Australia
has a perfunctory mention, and this is the
chief respect in which the disguised Commu-
nist differs —in name, at least —from his
nude, crude, piebald, international brother.
But the white stranger, however desirable,
who might help to turn the emptiness into
a White Australia is not to be encouraged
here unless employment is waiting for him,
also land and a house. It being no one’s
business to provide these things, he will pro-
bably be actively discouraged to stay away.
Then, by way of a big and decisive act, the
Federal Labor programme aims to obliterate
the Federation in toto. It is proposed to
wipe out the State Governors —not. so far
as appears, merely to do without the high-
priced and doubtfully useful imported sort,
but to extinguish the office altogether—and
to abolish the State Upper Houses, likewise
the elected State Lower Houses, or at least
the powers thereof. For the State Parlia-
ments there are to be substituted local coun-
cils, without even fixed delegated powers, but
merely with such as may be. permitted for
the moment by the Federal authority, so they
are really to have no powers at all. Finally,
it is proposed to saw off the top half of
the Federal authority by the extinction of
the Senate, so that States of small popula-

Public Health in N. S. Wales.
The futility of the V.D. Act as at present
administered in N. S. Wales was emphasised
by Dr. E. 11. Moleswortii, a Macquarie-
street skin specialist, who gave evidence be-
fore the Federal Health Commission last
week. Moleswortii is in charge of the
syphilis side of the V.D. clinic at Prince
Alfred Hospital, and lie told the Commission
that, though the Health Department is noti-
fied of cases treated in the public hospitals,
doctors now ignore the provision of the Act
which requires them to report private cases
as well. As was pointed out. if the Act
was not enforced for all, the doctor who re-
ported his private cases to the authorities
would soon be at a disadvantage with one
who observed secrecy. Patients naturally
would prefer tile latter. Other clauses of
the Act are as flagrantly broken. Sufferers
from V.D. may not engage in any job neces-
sitating the handling of food. But a but-
cher’s boy would be sure not to reveal his
true occupation when reporting to the hos-
pital for treatment, since he knew that so doing
meant putting himself out of work. 'Neverthe-
less, while expressing the opinion that there
were bound to be sufferers from syphilis
among restaurants carrying large staffs, Dr.
Moleswortii took the reassuring view
that infection from food or eating utensils
was practically nil. Infection thus trans-
mitted would manifest itself in the mouth
or throat; and in the comparatively few
cases where the disease did start there, prac-
tically always it could be traced to personal
contact with an infected person. He ad-
mitted that he would avoid drinking out of
a cracked or chipped cup in a public restau-
rant, but he did not think damaged crockery
was a factor in spreading the disease—cer-
tainly it was not worth legislating against.
A practical suggestion was made by the same
doctor regarding women in a state of preg-
nancy. Whereas under the old mercurial
treatment a diseased woman invariably trans-
mitted the syphilitic taint to the unborn off-
spring, modern treatment, if commenced suffi-
ciently early in pregnancy., freed the child
from the curse entirely. His suggestion was
that a blood test should be part of the
routine in every maternity hospital, so that
any syphilitic infection might be detected
and treated. In nine cases out of ten the
babes of syphilitic mothers not under proper
treatment did not survive, and those that
lived were doomed to suffer from the disease
themselves. Proper and timely treatment of
the mother in pregnancy, apparently, would
do away with hereditary syphilis, and would
knock a hole in the quaint theory that the
passage in the Old Testament about the sins
of the fathers being visited on the children
unto the third generation had special refer-
ences to syphilis, and was a token of Divine
disapproval of laxity in sex morals.

Fascism and Australia.
Mussolini, Italy’s self-appointed savior,
has been listening to some damaging criti-
cism, largely from his own followers. The
disclosures of Cesare Rossi, formerly chief
of his press bureau, caused so great a stir,
indeed, that the leader w T as moved to make
a renunciatory gesture. He announced that
his electoral system by which a bare majo-
rity at the elections entitled the party obtain-
ing it to two-thirds of all the seats would
be abandoned for the old-fashioned method
of single constituencies. Presently, however,
the threatening danger having passed, he
reverted to his former policy; and the veil
of a censorship more wonderful and complete
than even that of wartime descended on
the country. Another reigning sovereign
who has had the spotlight flung full on him
is Alphonso of Spain. Few monarclis have
ever been subjected to so devastating a criti-
cism as descended from the skies two months
ago on the sleek head of that romantic per-
son. • It came from a Spanish novelist who
varied the writing of best-sellers for foreign
consumption with an attempt to achieve re-
volution in his own country by means of
printed leaves. Owing to the Government’s
farseeing neglect of education, most of the
recipients of his eloquent appeal, which was
broadcast from an aeroplane, were unable
to read it, so that the pamphlets caused more
flutter in their descent than after their recep-
tion. Nevertheless, information that has
evaded the censor indicates that the country
of the bullfight is in the same condition of
temporarily suspended animation as Musso-
lini’s fief, the only difference being that the
headstrong King is the real misruler of the
country, and the much-boomed dictator,
Pbimo de Rivera, is a fat and distracted
little puppet who does what he is told. The
charge against the Spanish King, one of
the evil Bourbon crew, is that he persists in
carrying on a futile foreign war against the
Moors at a cost of £150,000 a day because
somebody told him he was a strategist; that
he was pro-German during the war and now
is offering facilities for Krupps to further
the militarist aims of the Fatherland by
erecting munition-works in Spain; and that
he is selling the country as fast as possible
to alien concession-hunters. It is a curious
example in human pathology that Australian
tourists who call themselves democrats should
return at the rate of one a week to this
country full of the praises of these two
effigies of misrule. The inference to be
gained from their utterances is that what
Australia needs is a Mussolini or an un-
crowned Alpiionso. That there is in this
country a small and vitriolic clique of aliens
who are preaching revolution in the open and
working for it in the dark is well enough
known. But to suggest that Australia can save
herself from their conspiracy only by handing
control over to another gang, just as certain
to be violent, bloody and impermanent, is
reactionary madness. That Australia could
produce a Mussolini when required is un-
doubted, and a Walsh or a Garden would
be as likely to apply for the position as a
Thomas Henley. Mussolini in his be-
ginnings was a Communist. ITis opportunity
of advancement came when Italy’s problems,
due to over-population exacerbated by feeble
party politics, reached the combustion point.
Australia is not suffering from over-popula-
THE JUGGERNAUT.
“The machinery of government in Russia seems to work well.”—From the report of the British
Trades Union Delegation, recently driven around Russia in blinkers:
tion, but from a lack of ports to foster her
industries, of railways to open her vacant
land for settlement and of honest policies
of development. None of these problems are
beyond the capacity of ordinary common-
sense and decent patriotism.
O
A fussy desire to make out a case for Soviet
Russia is one of the pre-occupations of Labor.
It appears to be generally recognised that
the place wants to be explained away and
toned down, though it is hard to see why it
shouldn’t be left to explain itself and tone
itself down, like China or Abyssinia. If
travelling in Russia was made safe and un-
restricted, it may be presumed that thou-
sands of visitors would go there, and write
it up, or write it down, and globe-trot gener-
ally as they do in Paris or Sydney, and the
alleged wonderland would be its own best
advertisement. Instead, deputations approach
it carefully, by arrangement, as if it was a
dangerous animal, and are shepherded so that
they may not steal any of the improvements.
A British trade-union delegation went across
lately, and, speaking no Russian, was offici-
ally steered around, and had matters ex-
plained to it. The main features of its report
were summed up thus
The union of Soviet Republics is a strong and
stable State. Government is based, firstly, on a
system of State Socialism, which has the active sup-
port of the large majority of workers, and acceptance
by an equally large majority of peasants, and,
secondly, on one federal structure which gives very
full cultural and very fair political liberties to
racial and regional minorities, together with full
religious toleration.... These good results have re-
conciled all but a very small minority to renouncing
the rights of opposition which are essential to political
liberty elsewhere.
In other words, the majority of workers
“approve”—or “accept,” which isn’t quite
the same thing—the Soviet system, though
how the delegates discovered this is unex-
plained. And the majority having “re-
nounced” the “rights of opposition”—“which
are essential to all political liberty” except
the Russian kind—it is to be assumed that
the worker who lets it be known that he
doesn’t approve gets beans, or else hell. This
being so, it isn’t quite clear how the delega-
tion expected to hear of opposition, even if
there was tons of it.

“W.F.H.”: Those Australian editors who
are afraid to publish the truth about "the
pitchers” are recommended to read some of
the better-class U.S. weeklies. A Bulletin
article on the screen-“art” of Hollywood was
reprinted in the Boston Independent, one of
the foremost of American literary papers,
with the subjoined comments, among others:
Our country is expressed to the world chiefly
through films of such incredible vulgarity that the
unhappiest notion exists abroad of American life
and morals and manners. American society is
presented as a mixture of crookedness, cunning and
imbecile sentimentality. A sophomoric eroticism
masquerades as a great moral lesson. A good story
is degraded into heart throbs and close-ups of slob-
bering heroines. Our business men are hard-boiled,
our young men are boors or Smart Alecks, our
maidens vacillate between the ingenuousness of morons
and the hard acumen of women of the town. Even
such outstanding pictures as “The Birth of a Nation”
and “Robin Hood” are defaced by a sentiment-
ality so stupid and so unnecessary that it is more
than bad art; it is insulting in its implications. We
can quite understand the reluctance ot' Australians to
send their boys and girls to Hollywood to learn
behavior. They would find better manners and a
more refined taste among the duckbills and kangaroos
of their native land.
Remarks equally pertinent have appeared in
the Art Review ana the American Mer-
cury; and The Bulletin lias been thanked
for the good friendship it has shown to the
real America.

“Fengshui” : Japan’s hatred of foieign
tutelage is unabated. A new dialect is
growing up in the country which will even-
tually become unintelligible to English-speak-
ing people. It is the brand of English taught in
Japanese schools and universities by native
teachers since the foreign professors were
dispensed with. Another of the Govern-
ment’s steps on the way back to Japan’s
historic policy of isolation is the new bill
prohibiting aliens or corporations in which
more than one-half the capital, officers, share-
holders or employees are aliens from owning
land within the Empire, which, by the way,
includes territories in which Japan has con-
stantly proclaimed the open door. Foreign
firms or persons already possessing land are
to dispose of their holdings within one year.
There is nothing much that is novel in the
new law, except the retrospective part.
Foreign ownership has always been severely
restricted in Japan since the days when
trade with Europe was confined to a handful
of Dutchmen who were incarcerated on the
tiny island of Desliima guarded by police and
blood-hounds. Tlie Japanese demand unre-
stricted admission to white countries whose
ideal is a community of free men with equal
rights. The hard knuckle of the above facts
makes the claim ring hollow.

“Pat Busiiie” : British justice won’t allow
a man’s record to be handed up to the Judge
or magistrate until the accused is convicted;
surely it is inconsistent with the principle
that the police are allowed to put aliases
after an accused’s name on the charge-sheets.
With many of the honorary magistrates in
the small towns, nothing is more damning
than an alias, or goes further towards secur-
ing a conviction. The same thing applies
with juries. A juryman once told me after
a case "Why we simply had to convict. He
had three aliases.”

In an effort to be affable (and he really does
that sort of thing very well) the N. S. Wales
Premier told a northern audience not to be
down-hearted though the Public Works Com-
mittee turns down every proposal to connect
the north with its natural ports, adding irre-
levantly that that body was created by
Henry Parkes to take railway construction
out of the hands of politicians. The audi-
ence cheered. Still it is difficult to see that
I’arkes did more more than make a smoke-
screen between himself and the public. Poli-
ticians agitate for railways, often where
there are lines already, because in these
places there are people and votes. Politi-
cians refer the idea to the P.W. Committee,
which is composed wholly of politicians. The
committee either rejects it or sends it back
to the politicians with a recommendation.
If the Railway Commissioners could send
their own proposals to the committee, and if
they had seats on the committee, and if they
could veto the committee’s schemes, or if the
committee contained no party politicians at
all hut was composed of experts, Parkes
really would have done something.

“Ditsseldorf” : Word comes from Germany
that the Communists propose nominating
their woman leader. Ki.ara Zatkin, for the
Presidency, vacant by the death of Ebert.
Although it would not be the first time Ger-
many’s destinies have been directed by a
woman, the move will not be taken seriously.
The skirted factor in German politics in
any case is negligible. An enormous number
of young unmarried women are employed in
industries, and, as in many European coun-
tries. many of them eke out their small
wages by attaching themselves to male
friends, to whom they refuse nothing. least
of all their vote. Changes in these alliances
are frequent, and the vote changes with them,
making the woman’s influence in politics
unstable. The leaders of the feminist move-
ment find themselves in consequence without
much of a following, and become a mere
excrescence on the parties ruled by men.

“Ox” : The Rev. Father E. F. Pigot, Direc
tor of Riverview College Observatory, Sydney,
one of the world’s highest authorities on
solar radiation, is giving his time and money
to the establishment of a solar radiation
station at Riverview. It is contended that
Australia, with its clear skies, offers oppor-
tunities superior to those of any other coun-
try for foretelling droughts and tempests by
this means. The farmer in Argentine reaps
the benefit of a splendidly equipped station
which supplies that country with weather
forecasts weeks ahead; and U.S.A. solar
authorities state that their forecasts have
been 84 per cent, correct during the last two
years, it is a branch of research work in
which the State Government might very
properly take a hand.

“Bos” : Why is it that the teaching of botany
in Victorian schools, and in the University
itself, is essentially non-Australian in char-
acter? Is it that the syllabus is drawn up
by botanists who received their training in
English universities, or is no Australian text-
book regarded as suitable? There should be
many men well qualified to write such a
text-book. I remember an elementary book,
by Dendy and Lucas, that I studied in my
youth, but on looking up the University
Calendar for the books recommended for the
intermediate certificate, I find only the
grudging admission that “Dendy and Lucas
may be consulted for certain Australian
types.” The text-books that are recom-
mended certainly are not Australian in char-
acter. Further on the Calendar, under the
head of subjects for the leaving certificate,
and dealing with practical exercises, lays it
down that “in the case of all natural orders
one example at least should be indigenous to
or naturalised in Victoria.” Only one, be it
noted. The teaching in the University itself
might take much greater account than it does
of our wonderful and unique flora. And
there should be more field work. The study
of plants in the laboratory is good in its
way, but the study of plants in their natural
environment is surely much better.

The Tom Walsh party made a fairly wide
sweep on a recent day by declaring all the
Commonwealth’s chartered ships “black,”
and some of its own ships also, and generally
slinging around the major and minor excom-
munication. Amid this flurry Prime Minis-
ter Bruce went up Lane Cove to commune
with Nature and discuss the surrender of a
scrap of Federal land to round off a blos-
somy reserve. A passionate man might have
deputed this job to a clerk while he took
up the ancestral battle-axe and went forth
to hack Thomas in three pieces; but it is
a great thing to have a calm disposition.
The High Court will be well-advised to
have a sandwich in its robe after this when
it waits for the bosses of the Seamen’s Uni'-’i
to appear in answer to a summons. Recently
the union as a body and seven or eight indi-
viduals, including the invariable Walsh and
Johanssen, were sent for. What was sought
this time was an order to require the
defendants to take some notice of previous
orders and of the law generally, and in par-
ticular to cease from holding up ships in the
old off-hand style. The court of three Judges
sat one long uneventful day waiting for the
defendants to turn up, and then adjourned.
It waited another day for the defendants to
take some notice of it, and adjourned again.
Constitutional authority in Australia hasn’t
formally abdicated yet, but it is serving a
very useful apprenticeship.
From a fed-up Digger:—
In spite of the fact that his Preference to
Soldiers Act has been a despised and mocked-at
paralytic from birth, and notwithstanding that it
has received another push toward the churchyard
from a recent magisterial decision, N.S.W. Premier
Fuller still maintains his parrot cry that “pre-
ference will be enforced.” When the Act was passed,
provision was made for the appointment of a
supervising board. Though it didn’t dare to repeal
the measure, sentiment for the A.I.F. being then
supposed to be strong, the Dooley Government ren-
dered it nugatory by omitting to appoint the board.
The return of Fuller witnessed no change in this
respect, anl, seeing this, employers blandly ignored
a measure which hitherto they had dodged by every
possible quibble, legal or otherwise. The Act came
its final thud when it was found powerless to
preserve the right of the Digger Wharfies’
Union to preference at their job in N. S. Wales.
The Government had been roaring horribly for days
about what it was going to do in the way of
standing by these men. It stood by and did nothing
so long that the disgusted Union practically went
over in a body to the opposition concern. And
Bruce’s record as regards preference is not much
better than Fuller’s. Although the Queensland section
of the Grafton-South Brisbane railway is being built
with Commonwealth money a Digger’s badge is no
good to the owner seeking a navvy’s job.
During January N. S. Wales imported
woollen piece-goods to the value of £160.263,
to say nothing of woollen yarn (£73,368),
apparel, rugs, carpets and sundries. Thus
piece-goods alone are coming in to this one
State at the rate of £1,923,156 p.a. It
wouldn’t be so bad if we knew that it was
Australian wool we were buying. As a
matter of fact, a good deal of it is probably
European or Asiatic rags; for British and
Continental weavers have been growling like
bears at the price Australian wool has been
fetching, and have been raking the world
for substitutes.
Having rushed into a three years’ contract,
Sydney’s Labor-ruled City Council is inquir-
ing of the contractor why the price is 2s. 3d.
a ton more than the Railway Commissioners
are paying for the- same class of coal. An
ordinary concern would have made the in-
quiry before signing the contract, but the
Council, as controlled since December, is not
an ordinary concern. In its zeal for emanci-
pating the masses, it is restricting municipal
employment to residents of the city proper.
This means that workers who now live in
suburban cottages wall have to come and
pig it in Sydney slums; but the Labor vote
in the Sydney Assembly electorate will be
correspondingly increased. And Aldermen
Iloldsworth, McGuinness and Burke, the
commission-agent, are on the Labor ticket
for the Sydney electorate.
The average British Laborite has a super-
stitious objection to calling himself a Pro-
tectionist, but he tends to get there all the
same. A number of Labor members in the
Commons now discourse freely about “the
exclusion of imports produced under unfavor-
able labor conditions” —presumably under
conditions unfavorable to the British work-
man who finds it difficult to compete against
them. If that is Cobdenism the brand isn’t
familiar.
THE BATTLE FOR THE BREEKS.
“The wife of the Vicar of All Saints’, St. Kikia (Vic.), having been nominated by the Women’s
National League, announced her candidature for Parliament. The Vestry, however, hag requested her to
stay her hand, on the score that politics would interfere with the work of the church. The Women s
National League is now thrashing the matter out with the Vestry.”
So much feeling has been aroused in
Queensland by the appointment of F. T.
Brennan, Minister for Public Instruction,
to the Supreme Court Bench that the Too-
woomba by-election would be easy for a
f.a.q. nominee of a j>olid non-Labor party.
But the Opposition split into the usual snarl-
ing factions as soon as the vacancy was
announced, and instead of one non-Labor
candidate there will probably be three. And
contingent voting is optional in Queens-
land. The strongest card in Queensland
Labor’s hand is the stupidity of the other
side. ’
Holman, K.C., has bursts of brilliant
inaccuracy that approach to genius. In the
14tli furlong of his speech to the N.S.W.
New States Commission, the ex-Premier
announced that the creation of fresh trade
outlets is a fallacy:—
Regarding additional ports, experience throughout
the world pointed to concentration on single ports.
Taking Britain as a familiar example, be-
tween 1898 and 1922 the shipping of Liver-
pool increased by over nine and a half million
tons, that of Newcastle and Shields by a
little more than eight millions, that of
London by barely eight millions, and that of
Cardiff by about seven million tons. That
doesn’t look like concentrating on a single
port. And the Frenchman and Italian would
guffaw at Holman’s dictum, too. The one-
State-one-port disease is, in fact, a purely
Australian institution, even Maoriland and
Tasmania having contrived to escape it.
At least two Judges have lately ordered
severe floggings, one in Victoria, the other
in N. S. Wales. There is something wrong
with either the Judges or the community;
and the Judges ought to be called upon (o
justify themselves. If the repulsive punish-
ment has become necessary, then it can only
be because our civilisation has slipped back;
and the Judges ought to be given a chance
to set that out unmistakably. If it is so,
the matter is infinitely more serious than
whether a couple of bad characters should be
thrashed; and for an Executive to merely
cut out the prescribed flogging is to dodge
the problem which the sentences have raised.
Sentence of death has been passed on the
Bureau of Commerce and Industry. One
of Hughes’s many contributions to the tower-
ing pyramid of over-government, it has
existed for five years, and cost from £20,000
to £25,000 without doing a penn’orth of good.
Its “director,” one Stirling Taylor, was
brought from Westralia, where he had been
a farmer and then secretary of a co-operative
enterprise, and given £l5OO p.a. to make an
occasional speech and issue an annual report
which nobody read. He is an affable char-
acter, and looks picturesque, but Australia
can’t afford to pay a man £125 a month for
being affable and looking picturesque.
One day last week Gillies, the new Queens-
land Premier, assured the State executive
of the A.W.U. that he would not allow em-
ployers to reduce wages as from July 1,
when, in accordance with a 1924 Act, the
working week is to consist of 44 hours,
instead of 48. Replying next day to an-
other A.W.U. deputation, which urged him
to hurry on with Government dirt-jobs, since
the union had 500 navvies unemployed, the
same gentleman pleaded that “the financial
stringency has prevented new works being
undertaken.” Perhaps the 500 navvies will
all get toil when the new law adds 8| p.c.
to the labor cost of the works that the” Go-
vernment can't afford to start as things are,
but it’s a queer way of dealing with an un-
employed problem. Queer also is the Gov-
ernment’s assumption that there will be no
difficulty about getting the private employer
to pay a 48-liour wage, fixed for the most
part by the careful MeCawley, C.J., for 44
hours’ exertion. After July 1 Queensland
will be a thrilling field of study for the poli-
tical economist.
Every Sunday people are to be seen play-
ing cricket in Moore Park, Sydney, golf on
the municipal links and private courses, and
tenuis on nearly every court not municipally
owned. Yet now, because the City Council
has decided to throw open the municipal
tennis-courts on Sundays, a howl lias gone
up, not only from the Methodist Conference,
but from people who might have been ex-
pected to take a broader view. There is
even talk of testing the legality of the
Council’s decision. To be consistent, the
supporters of gloom shouldn’t stop at fight-
ing Sunday tennis on municipal courts; they
should strive to get all Sunday games
declared unlawful. In that case it would
be shown how small a section of public
opinion they represent.
From one of the delegates
The position as regards Arthur Griffith (B.
19/2/’25), who was a conscriptionist during the
war like Angwin, Acting-Premier of Westralia, Tommy
Walker and other Jarrahland Laborites, is that a
motion for the re-admission of the erstwhile N.S.W.
Works Minister was placed on the business-paper at
the last State Labor Conference by the Liverpool
League. Conference invited Griffith to attend, but
before the motion could be put the point of order
was raised, in the interests of some of the Lang
crowd, that, while the rule barring the re-admission
of conscriptionists stands, the motion could not be
put. President Willis held that the point was fatal.
However, next Conference will be asked to amend
the rule by adding the words “except by a vote of
Conference,” and there is little doubt that Griffith
will then be re-admitted. Apropos Federal Labor-
leader Charlton told the Conference that Griffith would
be an invaluable accession to the strength of his'
party in the House of Reps.
To test the validity of the ancient Stage
Coach Act as applied to motor-’buses, the
Vic. Government is going to prosecute a
’bus-owner operating under one of the five-
shilling licenses. The magisterial decision,
whatever it may be, will assuredly be re-
viewed by the Supreme Court, and possibly
the High Court, at the instance of the dis-
satisfied party. In the meantime the Minis-
try has warned the ’busmen that evasion
of the Motor ’Bus Act, 1924, may be a losing
game. It has been suggested that Parlia-
ment should be summoned four months
ahead of the usual time to repeal the Stage
Coach Act, but Ministers point out that
the most that can be lost in revenue by
dodging the ’Bus Act is £lO,OOO for the
half-year ending June 30.
Trouble arrived early in the Westralian
branch of the amusing foreign-trade organ-
isation known in Melbourne as “the Town
and Country Union,” and in Perth as “the
Tariff Reduction League.” When the
“objects” were announced to a meeting which
could have been accommodated in a small
bar-parlor, one It. E. White pronounced
them “nebulous.” Prowse, M.11.R., objected
that the League was providing too wide a
door for Parliamentary candidates. Two
other gentlemen declared themselves out-and-
out Cobdenites. Thereupon the chairman,
who had protested that the League had no
idea of breaking down Protection, that being
the settled policy of the country, urged that
the constitution and platform should be
adopted without further outpourings. “The
essential thing,” he said, “is to get to work.”
Quite right—except that the second “to” is
superfluous.
Some men have queer plans for reform-
ing the world. Two of the stewards of the
Aorangi, the Union Co.’s new oil-burner, got
in trouble at Auckland. In evidence it
transpired that they were in the habit of
throwing dustpans, brooms, tumblers,
cushions and general gear wholesale into
the ocean. It was their method of drawing
attention to the injustice of the social
scheme. A “bourgeois” magistrate whose
name isn’t Powers merely said they were
fanatics and public nuisances and gave them
a bit of gaol.
Though public opinion strongly condemns
David Kirkwood for his recent attack on
the Prince of Wales, Royalty is largely to
blame too. For instance. During the visit
of Edward P. to Rotorua it was firmly
broken to the M.L. Government that the
idea of the heir to the throne travelling on
a side-line was unthinkable. The Govern-
ment acquiesced, and at a cost of some thou-
sands a cross line was hurriedly laid down
for a short distance to avoid shunting and
conform with the ridiculous demand. That
new line was never used, as a strike caused
the Prince’s plans to be changed, but the
country had to pay for the work. Royalty
and the friends of Royalty should have the
sense to insist that flunkeyism of this sort
be dispensed with.

“Professor David, writing on evolution in the
S.M. Herald, estimates that the Piltdown (Sussex)
man lived about two hundred thousand years ago.”
We are heirs of the ages—yes, of course—who harness
lightning and cleave the sky,
And taat to the ends of the earth in Morse and
croon free verse for a lullaby.
And upward ever, you say, we climb and nearer
the gods we ha’ shaped we grow.
But I’d liefer ha’ lived in the world's dim prime
With Adam and Eve in the womb of Time,
Along with the clan
Of the Piltdown man
Two hundred thousands of years ago.
’Tis like enough he was ape or near-*-prognathous,
brutish and all the rest—
And he never could breast the bar for beer because
there wasn’t a bar to breast.
And he hadn’t a cricket ball to hurl or a springy,
verdant lawn to mow,
Or even a silken-stockinged girl
In a jazz or a bunny-hug to whirl,
Or a paper to scan,
The Piltdown man
Two hundred thousands of years ago.
You could hardly say, I suppose, he dined, who
gnawed the rib of his aurochs raw,
And seldom, except she snarled or whined, passed
on the bone to his hungry squaw.
He grilled in the summer sun, that’s pos., and froze
mayhap in the lee Age snow.
Why do I envy him then ? Because
lie didn’t know what Ne Temere was,
The Piltdown man
In the woods who ran

“Phial”: An absent-minded professor of
Perth University has a habit of walking with
his stick held rigidly in front of him. En-
tering a big mercery store a few days ago
he laid his cane on the counter while he
delved into his pocket for change, llien, to

Bunga (Vic.), was out stripping wattle-

finger of the right hand. After killing the
reptile Rachel transferred the tomahawk to
her left hand, placed her right on a stump
and chopped—three times. The first _ blow
took the index digit, the second the “middle

“Troophorse”: Putting inter-tribal fights
out of it, the nearest approach to a battle
ever fought in Australia, of which evidences
still remain, took place on the shores of
the Gulf. Many years ago a fleet of Macas-
sar proas were working a trepang camp on
Winciielsea Island, and the great fight was
between the natives of Groote and adjacent
islands and the visiting Macassars. The
origin of it was that the Macassars, keep-
ing up some old festive custom, broke out
on the drunk. A few natives in the camp
joined in the festivities, and as if the news
had been suddenly broadcasted other natives
swept down on the camp from nowhere. As
the hosts hadn’t sufficient liquor to treat
the whole country-side, many of the new-
comers showed resentment, and the subse-
quent engagement was a sanguinary one.
To-day one may count 27 little mounds in a

rind trees. Each grave has a cone-shell at
one end; several still show the remains of
wooden posts, but the white-ants haven’t

“Top Rail” : Army medical orderlies were
a casual crew. The chap on the next
stretcher to me at the C.C.S. behind Amiens
had been badly smashed and was suffering
dreadfully. I was heartening him up as
well as a piece of h.e. against mv backbone
would let me, and had pretty well convinced
him that he was quite all right, when he im-
plored a passing orderly to turn him on to
his side. “What, turn you over?” was that
comforter’s comment. “Gor blime, young
’un, wotcher givin’ us? If yer move yer
flamin’ eylash yer’ll blinkin’ well fall ter
pieces.” Still, the chap lived.

“Ces”: I know a quicker escape into
civvies than any yet mentioned. It
was at Maryborough (Q.), and I was
a reporter on one
of the local rags.
The local hero was
due to arrive back
by the morning
train. This boy
had risen from pri-
vate to captain,
and brought back
with him an impos-
ing list of decora-
tions. Before join-
ing up he had been
a fisherman. Hear-
in g that some
people wanted to
make a fuss of him
he jumped from
the train as it
slowed down at the
station before
Maryborough, and
footed it home,
thus escaping the
welcome. I was
“down” to inter-
vi e w him, and
raced over to his
house immediately
I discovered he was
not on the train. I
arrived home ten
minutes after he
did, and met him at
the gate, dressed in
full rig of working
clothes. “Hullo,”
he greeted me. “I’ve just got out of ’em;
goin’ down to the river to have a look at
the old boat.”

“H.H.”: A real “Keystone comic” was
sprung upon Melbourne lately when the Syd-
ney express emptied out more than a score of
people belonging to an American tourist party
which is running an observant eye over Aus-
tralia and some of the rest of the world.
The alert visitors had scheduled the inspec-
tion of Melbourne as a 24-hour job; and,
though Melbourne mav have felt hurt at
first, it was presently laughing at the spec-
tacle of the members of the party, with
sandwiches in one hand and bottles of re-
freshment in the other, rushing nt top speed
through the city on their task of inspection.
The complete party from the U.S.A. numbers
47 people; but the pace must have tired some
of them, for they stayed in Sydney while
their friends hurried across the Murray.
The day after their arrival the party packed
itself in the train again and exchanged
views upon the Art Gallery, State and
Federal Parliaments, the railway system and
other matters of interest. Melbourne’s only
apprehension is that there will be a lot of
new books written to tell the world all about
it.

“Warder”: A perfect lady by the name of
Rose is enjoying the hospitality of the State
at its Long Bay (Sydney) seaside resort.
Rose is a financier on the wrong side of
the law, or, more accurately stated, partly on
one side and partly on the other, for, accord-
HARD ON THE LADY.
ADAM: “ You know, a woman isn’t really interesting until she has
a past behind her.”
EVE: “Oh, undoubtedly! And more especially if you think she has
another in front of her.”
ing to police account, she is a landlord
drawing rentals from no fewer than 72
houses. John Hop also alleges—and this
is a first-hand fact —that she is one of the
most expert thieves in Sydney, and admits
that from her artistic treatment of gentle-
men from the country, and doubtless from
the city, too, she has made the comfort-
able income of a thousand a year. At all
events, in the little matter which led to her
temporary retirement she was in a position
to offer a sufficient inducement to tempt a
K.C. to go down to the undignified Police
Court where she was charged, as_a prelimin-
ary to Sessions, with stealing £l5O from the
pocket of a man who was accustomed more
to the scent of the salt sea wave than the
patchouli of the ladies who, to quote Horace,
haunt the windy corners of the city streets.
When he came to his senses a little later on
he felt in his inner breast pocket to see if his
packet of notes was safe. A cursory press-
ing on the outside of the coat convinced him
that it was —he could feel the wad. Still a
little dubious, he thought it might be well
to count the notes, so he thrust his hand into
the pocket and drew out—a little parcel of
torn paper! It was very cleverly done; quite
the work of an artist. He went to the police,
gave a description of the woman, and later
on was called to identify her out of a num-
ber of others. Rose had readjusted her hair
and costume, but all the paint and powder in
Paris could not deceive the man from the
waterfront. “That’s her,” he exclaimed; “I
could tell her face in a tannery.” Now
Rose, with a lot of convictions against her
name, is taking a holiday for 15 months and
draws her rents by proxy.

“Gilliesland”: I never realised what
schooling could do for the black female of
the species until I tried to patch up a peace
between an abo. employed by me here in
North Queensland and _ his wife, who had
been trained on a mission station. To the
latter I wrote asking her to return to lief-
domestic duties, as her lord felt lonely; she
replied as follows direct to the lord afore-
said :
My Dear husband,—l hate you too much ever to
live with you again. You are a dirty, low, black
brute.
From your loving wife, Polly.

“Mag”: Puzzles for the G.P.O. ? An
English letter which recently arrived in Bris-
bane bore, attached to a surname, the com-
prehensive address, “The Bush, Queensland.”
To the eternal honor of the postal officials,
after a few likely names had been selected
from the directory, the third try struck the
right claimant, a lady residing at Mt. Perry.

“Hambone”: Those city males who have
been sweating behind a barricade of linen
round their necks during these muggy days
will feel pleased to learn that this year
marks the centenary of the detachable male
collar. Of course a woman was at the
bottom of it. In 1825 Mrs. Hannah Mon-
tagu. wife of a Troy (New York) black-
smith, grew tired of washing her lord’s
shirts when merely the collars had become
besmirched. She therefore operated on the
garments with a pair of scissors. Thence-
forward no shirt in her charge saw soap and
water until the matter was urgent; washing
a detached collar was a simple thing. Soon
Mrs. Montagu tvas selling detachable collars
to neighbors, and in a dozen years factories
were needed to meet the demand for them.

“R.N.W.”: I remember a prisoner who
escaped by obeying a warder’s instructions
literally. This was one Logic, a N.T. native
of splendid physique, who many years ago
was serving a long
term of imprison-
ment in the Dry
Creek Gaol, a few
miles north of
Adelaide. Having
served a fair
stretch of his sen-
tence without giv-
ing any trouble.
Logic was regarded
as a trustworthy
nigger who had
almost come to look
upon the prison as
a home. Blasting
operations were
going on at the
quarry, and the
native was being
initiated into the
art of lighting the
fuse, a final and
solemn injunction
being administered
to be sure and run
directly the fuse
“fizzed.” Logic
did exactly as he
was told. In fact,
he ran so hard that
when next sighted
by his pursuers he
was hundreds of
miles north of
Adelaide en route
to Darwin. He
was brought back,
but the remainder of his sentence was soon
afterwards remitted, and he was returned
to his own country.

“G.E.C.”: If France has really annexed
Adelie Land, as reported, she can at least
claim this piece of Antarctica by right of
discovery. Lying directly south of Tasmania,
it was discovered by that gallant Pacific
navigator, Dumont D’Urville, tn January 21,
1840. After his voyage to the Pacific in
1826-29, when he settled the question of the
fate of La Perouse and erected a monument
to his compatriot on the reefs of Vanikoro,
north of the New Hebrides, D’Urville was
sent with the frigates Astrolabe and Zelee to
make an attempt to pass the furthest south,
reached by Weddell in 1823. At his first
essay, in 1838, he failed to get even as far as
the Antarctic Circle, but two years later,
spurred on by news of British and American
expeditions, he resolved to try to reach the
south Magnetic Pole. Leaving his sick at
Hobart Town, he set sail on January 1,
1840, and three weeks later, sighted rocky
mountains 3000 to 4000 feet high, which he
named Adelie Land; he landed in an islet
off the icebound coast, and formally took

possession of it. A few days later he left
the Antarctic, and returned to France, where
an untin.ely end awaited him. Sj far as is
known this coast remained unvisited until
the Mawson expedition landed at Common-
wealth Bay in 1912. Incidentally this
expedition discovered that much of the other
Antarctic land reported by D’Urville doesn’t
exist.

THE RETURN OF SATAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“At the Adelaide Methodist Conference the Rev.
Potts declared the Church was up against a pro-
gramme of propaganda directly organised by the
Devil. He believed that Satan actually existed and
was behind Sunday picnics.”
What—back ? Great Fiend, who filled my youth
with fears
And melted, mist-like, with advancing years,
Long since I dreamed they had you on the shelf,
With leprechaun and pixie, gnome and elf,
Banshees and grey wehr-wolves that roamed the wold,
And ghouls that round the churchyards hung of old,
And unicorns and dragons of the prime,
Restricted nowadays to pantimime,
Or jimjams following a drinking bout.
I reckoned Science had you counted out,
Scheduled upon the mythologic list.
Auld Clootie, can it be you still exist?
’Tis true you do not wear the form you wore,
But then you’ve often changed your shape before.
Illustrious Milton made you first arise,
Bold Lucifer, before my startled eyes.
I featured you some furlongs high, or long,
A stately demon in the poet’s song,
Lolling majestic in sulphureous flame
And playing manfully a losing game,
Your devilries accustomed to rehearse
In smoothly excellent iambic verse.
You lost a lot in dignity and weight,
Satan, when Barham brought you up to date,
But gained perhaps in fearsomeness and craft
With horns upon your head and tail abaft.
Cleft hooves —conceivably the pitchfork, too—
Made you a bit more humorous to view;
Deeds diabolical were still your forte,
Still you were always outlined as a sport.
When matched against you saints were always win-
ners,
But what a taking way you had with sinners!
And have you come again, unseen but seeing,
To roam the world as a material being,
Transformed like Hiawatha's “Yenna-dizze,”
Translated, a la Bottom, but as busy
FELT IT COMING.
“Did you expect me to accept you the night you proposed?”
“I did. Just before I reached your home I walked under a ladder
and a dog howled three times.”
IVith traps and pitfalls for our feet as when
Y r ou strode unmasked among the sons of men?
And do you lurk in sylvan picnic spots,
Sundays, as pictured by the Reverend Potts,
Four whisper still seductive, and your lure
A pocketful of Bolshie literature ?
Who “banks the fires and grins behind the bars”
To set your Darkness free for church bazaars
Or to instil in aldermanic frames
A godless tolerance for Sunday games?
A slouching figure, clad in shabby black
Or sober grey, mayhap ! —but still you’re back.
I see you dodging in and out the trees
Where buns are munched and ginger-beers appease
The thirst. Not these the scenes you once beset
To mark your victims down and cast your net.
Still, even Satan with, the times must move....
I wonder how you like your modern groove.

“E.S.”: Hone was the son of a King
County Maori chief, and with his college
education had acquired a liberal assortment
of the white man’s vices. With the shrewd-
ness of his type he got a slice out of most
of the native land deals in his neighborhood,
but a fondness for cards and other money-
eating diversions often kept him in low
water. One night 'Hone and Rangi sat down
at the local boarding-house to poker with a
couple of visitors, and when they knocked off
Hone signed a tidy cheque for his losings.
Next morning Rangi went with the other two
into Auckland, where in due course he
learned they were notorious sharpers. Off
he rushed and wired his compatriot to “stop
cheque.” Came the reply; “Don’t worry ;
cheque will stop itself.”

“T.P.”: I can’t help feeling sorry for the
lassie who put in a full attendance for 12
years at a S. Aus. high school (B. 26/2/’25).
It means that between the age of five
(minimum) and 17 not a single half-day’s
attendance has been missed. The physio-
logical aspect surely needs no stressing. Ever
since a poor girl staggered into my room
just before roll call, crying “Please, I feel
so ill, but I must get my mark,” and fell to
the floor in a state of collapse, I have sternly
squelched this form of feverish competition.

“Sixenate” : Terror of having broken the
law takes a quick grip on the souls of some
people. A remittance man in Melbourne,
anticipating that his usual allowance would
come to hand next day, filled in and cashed a
cheque, and was smitten with horror when
the cash failed to arrive. He made a flight,
and his sudden disappearance caused his
friends anxiety; but after enduring Heaven
knows what torments for three days he
appeared at a police station and announced
that he had come to “give himself up.” Of
course no warrant had been issued, but the
police, to clear up the affair, got into touch
with the man who cashed the cheque and
found that he had not even banked it.

“Gerphlin”; Got off the train at Narro-
mine (N.S.W.) the other day, and in front
of the pub where I intended to stay the
night I was amazed to see about a dozen
coatless men, hopping about and mak-
ing frantic grabs at the atmosphere. I
thought at first glance that the hot weather
and the local brand of sarsaparilla had upset
the inhabitants, but the butcher reassured
me. “They’ve bin ’avin’ a bob in,” he ex-
plained, “and th’ first bloke to grab a grass-
hopper on the wing wins the pool. I’m
savin’ a deener with that bloke with th’
corks round ’e’s ’at —’e’s ’ot stuff at ’opper-
grabbin’.” Years ago, when the rabbits took
possession of Collie, a two-pub village on
the Marthaguy River, the winner of the “bob
in” was the chap who killed the first cotton-
tail after the dogs had chased them out from
underneath one or other of the taverns.

“C.M.”; The Sydney Gazette of Jan. 29,
1820, printed a list of charges for burial in
the old Sandhills Cemetery, then situated
where the Ilaymarket is now. Half a guinea
covered everything, including ss. for the
parson and Od. for the operator who tolled
the bell. That seems reasonable; but at
Norfolk Island, even to-day, one may get

buried for less. The inhabitants observe a
custom handed down by their forefathers of
Pitcairn. When anyone dies, the grave is
dug by the islanders, who also make the
coffin and the wooden cross. There is no
burial fee, not even for the tourist, and the
high cost of dying worries the inhabitants
less even than it did old Sydneyites. Inci-
dentally, there are no marriage fees, either.

“Country Ped”: I know one family Bible
that was of use as “a private registry of
births, deaths and marriages” (B. 26/2/’25).
In the early ’sixties an uncle of mine was
born aboard ship just outside the heads of
Port Phillip Bay. Presumably the record
of his birth went down on the ship’s log.
but it was never registered elsewhere; and
when in later years he endeavored to have
his life insured, he was unable to produce
any tangible evidence of his age. Someone
thought of the old family Bible and its pages
of records; but the old home and its effects
had been sold by auction, and the auctioneer’s
books did not specify the Bible or the buyer.
Twelve months later, however, my father
spotted it in the bookcase of a friend. The
entry of my uncle’s birthday in his mother’s
angular handwriting was unquestioningly
accepted by the insurance company.

“Nikko”: The widespread dissatisfaction
periodically expressed about hanging as a
means to an end
impels me to draw
attention to the
excellence of the
old Maori method
of capital punish-
ment. After one
of the inter-tribal
clashes of the brave
days of old, the
prisoners were
brought before _the
victorious chief,
who, with his knife-
edged mere of
greenstone, d i s-
posed of them one
by one. It is on
record that the
great Te Whero
Wliero, with his
famous mere, now
in the British
Museum —it was
polished for 300
jears and buried
12 times —once had
a busy morning
with 350 enemy
prisoners, and de-
spatched each one
with a single blow'
of the weapon,
never bungling
once. The blow,
an upward one, delivered to the kneeling
victim, neatly cleft the skull. That s some-
thing like an executioner.

“Herodot”: The Chinaman may often be
punctilious concerning the oath-taking
ceremony of cutting off a roosters head (B.

water from the Ganges, but I never heard
of a Hindu raising the question whether the

matter of fact it usually comes from the tap.
One of the State Governments went to the
expense of importing a quantity of genuine
Ganges water for oath-takihg purposes, but
the precious liquid became so evil-smelling
that it might have offended the nose of even
a native of India, and was thrown away.
The Mohammedan is also willing to take a
good deal on trust. The official copy of
A 1 Koran is generally kept in a green baize

“Ave, Yale”: Re phantom ships, marine
mirages, etc. (B. 5/2/’25). When in May,
1896, the old Monowai (Captain Carey),
’Frisco bound, was 80 or 100 miles
off Auckland, the passengers saw a phenome-
non which lias never
yet been satisfactorily
explained. It was a
three-masted schooner,
under full sail, not
cruising along, but
seemingly at a stand-
still, some 20 miles to
the starboard, and
right side up. Under
skipper’s orders the
look-out concentrated
on the vessel, and
eventually reported her
disappearance thus:
“Blime, she’s gone up,
sir! Gone right up
into the white clouds 1”
Captain Carey spoke
two other steamers
the same morning, but
neither had seen the
schooner, nor was any
such vessel reported at
or passing any M.L.
port that same week.
To-day’s wireless won-
ders prompt the sug-
gestion that the out-
lines of that schooner
were ethergrammed from the top of the
Pacific.

“Machete”: “Tauwarra’s” reference (P>.
12/2/’25) to the late Billy the Cook at
Samarai reminds me that William had some
reputation as a razor-setter in a land ■where
barbers were not and shingling was done
with a pair of clippers. Getting one’s razors
back from Billy was not, however, so easy
as handing them over. An additional griev-
ance was that the recovered implement was
often blunter than before and quite as fre-
quently it was not the same razor. Further-
more. no one had ever seen Billv sharpening
a blade, and since he was usually on public
view, in one capacity or another, for 20 hours
of the day. there was little time for surrep-
titious honing. One evening, late, Billy con-
fessed his secret. Leading his confidant into
the silent bar, he pointed out two drawers
under the counter, both containing razors.
When a razor was handed over, Billy put it
in the left-hand drawer. When the drawer
filled he transferred a batch to the right-
hand drawer. These were returned to their
owners or to anyone else with a verbal
claim, as occasion required. He charged
nothing, but as each razor meant at least
half a dozen visits to the bar Billy probably
found the side-line profitable.

“Gerald Henry’?: True poetry crops up in
the most unexpected places. I asked our old
washerlady what was the most beautiful
sight she had ever seen. She thought for a
few minutqs; then said, “Well, it makes my
heart gladder than anything* else I know to
see 24 clean wet pillowslips blowing in the
sun on my clothes-line.” She is a hard
worker, if ever there was one—she reared
seven sons on a farm in Gippsland, though
her husband deserted her when the youngest
was a baby, and saw every one live to serve
in the war. But. besides being a hard worker
and a good mother, it seems to me she has
the soul of an artist.

“Sturt”: The latest development of the
“strange man” yarn is concerned with a
South Aus. highway robbery. It was a
hold-up under arms, but amateurishly con-
ducted, the bandit annexing only about half
of his victim’s loose cash. As he was masked
the chief evidence against him was the recog-
nition of his voice and his subsequent in-
ability to explain his whereabouts at the
time. He assured the jury that he was quite
innocent, and that a mysterious stranger the
day after the robbery had forced upon him with
threats a revolver and a mask. There was
no hesitation about the verdict of guilty;
but the Court, after hearing evidence of good
character, thought it over for a day or two
before saying seven years.

“Bouragi”: Both men were storekeeper-
publicans, after the Papuan fashion of those
early days, and, according to the custom of
the country for non-official residents, each
maintained a native lady as housekeeper.
Their mutual hatred halted just short of
murder; but one day the arrival of a new
missionary on tour worked a miracle. lie
gave both of them such a tongue-lashing that
they found themselves fraternising, for
mutual protection, before the good man’s
back was turned. They were both Scots,
and that evening celebrated the armistice
with song and the wine of their country;
and both were carried to bed at a late hour.
But when No. 1 staggered into his bar-
room next morning his eyes fell on something
which definitely ended the rapprochement.
Sitting on the earthen floor was the house-
keeper of his former enemy and over-night
friend in conversation with his own chate-
laine ! He had long ago forbidden the damsel
to darken his doors, and the memory of the

preceding niglit had presumably vanished.
At any rate, in answer to his frenzied bellow-
ings, a posse of retainers rushed in. headed
by his boss boy. and before she quite knew
what had happened the visitor was laid face
downwards on the ground, while the boss
boy laid on with a four-foot lawyer-cane.
When released the lady covered the 200 yards
to her protector’s store in three jumps, so
legend says. The uproar of her approach
brought her lord to the door with inquiry
written all over him. The lady spent all
her remaining breath in one shriek of accusa-
tion. Then, turning about, sbe hoisted her
only garment with both hands as corrobora-
tive evidence. The subsequent fight lasted
with intervals for rest and refreshment for
several days—until the warden returned
from a journey. Even then the leg-irons had
to be rattled to bring about a truce.

Income will top the million mark in two
years if the rate of progress shown last term
is maintained. It will be a fine achievement
as ivell as a striking endorsement of the
policy which has been pursued during the
past 20 years by that most unconventional of
all life-office heads, managing-director George
Crowley. In the two decades 1905-1024
income has expanded Ilf times, and it lias
more than doubled since 1919. Yet all the
time “big business” has been almost the last
thing thought of. George Crowley’s plan
has been to attract it, not go after it with a
stockwhip. The success of the plan is further
slioAvn in these figures :

1924 .. 371,934 66,427 227,416 2,970,039
The figures quoted vary from those in the
introductory table: the latter excludes, cash
bonuses used to purchase additional insur-
ance. Bonuses are a main part of the bird-
lime, and the better they are the more easily
they are earned. In 1914 they were £28,31 <,
of which £26,979 was applied to purchase
additional assurance: last year they were
£147,400. and £141,984 was left with the
office. The plan of disclosing the aggregate
bonus and the amount used in buying new
paid-up insurance is one of the many fea-
tures which make this office a little different
from the others. Last year premiums totalled
£438.361 and the cash bonuses amounted to
£l47,4oo—over 34 p.c. The society, having
found that it could provide for £3 insurance
which it thought would cost £4, was pre-
pared to hand over the difference, but nearly
all policy-holders were wise enough to take
it out in extra insurance.
Claimed to be “the highest paid by any
office in the Umpire,” the bonuses certainly
justify the pride expressed in the annual re-
port. They are possible because, first, the
management keeps watch on expenses with a
well-ground axe handy. Young cos. which
run to glass-topped tables for the office-boys
and electric push-bells by the dozen vociferate
their intention of writing big business—a
half-million or whatever figure fancy dic-
tates. Some even make a -passable shot at
their bullseye—at costs which get up near
200 p.c.! The City Mutual cuts out busi-
ness which goes above a cost-line fixed by
the office. That insistence is appreciated by
old policy-holders, who express it by keeping
up their payments :

How the business sticks can be judged by
comparing those last two lines. If all the
new business written in 1023 had stuck, and
if no old policies had become claims through
death or surrender, then the 1024 renewal
business would have amounted to £403,873.
Actually it was £371,034. So the difference
(£31,930) represented all that was lost to the
office not merely in lapses, but in matured
and surrendered policies. Losses by death
last year were lighter than were allowed for
in the calculations :
1916. . £30.801 | 1919. . £43,973 1922.. £50,284
1917.. 61,333 I 1920.. 34,692 1923.. 54,093
1918.. 55,534 | 1921.. 47,034 1924.. 44,965
This over-provision is another important fac-
tor in swelling the distributable surplus. It
is a fine thing for an office when, through
careful selection of risks, a policy-holder goes
on paying premiums for 20 years longer than
it was assumed he would. He doesn t growl
much about it himself, as a «nd his
fellow-policy-holders score like. Hobbs.
The new business cost keeps at about the
same mark. In 1914 it was 74 p.c. It has
not varied much. Last year (on the accepted
calculation that old business costs 7 p.c.)
it was 74.6 p.c. Indeed, it was almost cer-
tainly less, because this society’s investments
call for special care and attention, 'which
must raise the cost to more than 7 p.c. Of
coarse, the return on investments makes the
added expenditure, relatively slight, well
worth while. This is how the co. places
its funds:—
1914. p.c. 1924. p.c.
Public securities . . £123,008 16.0 £543.815 17.7
Mortgages .. .. 362,992 47.0 1,850,320 60.0

Cash & sundries . . 24,243 3.1 118,300 3.8
£771,350 £3,085,102
There is nothing wrong with investment in
loans so long as the security is watched. In
this matter also the office is unconventional.
It wants to make money for its policy-holders,
and it accepts any chance that offers if it
thinks there is no undue risk in it. It
assumes that the highest rate it will obtain
from its investments will be 3* p.c. Actu-
ally, last year the return, on average funds
was 8 2 p.c. or more than twice that much.
But all that 8.2 p.c. was not interest. Some
0 f it was “profit on realisation of securities,
etc.” To provide against possible losses
there is a reserve for contingencies, £60,000,
which was not added to last year; but it
does not follow that all the profit on sales
is shown —there is no reason why an insur-
ance office shouldn’t have inner reserves like
a bank or other financial concern. As a
matter of fact the City Mutual owns up to
having f 206 600 up its sleeve: the actuary
found £354.000 more than enough to satisfy
policy liabilities, and only £147,400 is dis-
tributed. And this £206,600 is independent,
of course, of any hidden reserve there may
be in the under-valuation of securities.

That record profit moves this Column to
raise its Australian hat appreciatively. Not
that the profit is relatively the best: there
have been better, but that was in years
when there was less capital to feed. And
capital has expanded very rapidly, as these
figures show (1916 was the last complete
vear before the reconstruction) :
1916. 1924.
Oum. pref. “A” (7 p.c.) .. £29,736 £29,*36
Preference “B” (9 p.c.) ..
Ordinaries .. .. .. 19,824 165,000
£49,560 £244,736
Nor is there much gift scrip in that quarter-
million, and what loading there has been is
now counterbalanced by accumulated profits.
Pearson, Law. Ltd., paid £7OOO for the good-
will of the Pearson-Law business, and that
had been reduced in the books to £2OOO at
the time of the reconstruction, when it
bounded up to £17.051. “Underwriting,
commission and preliminary expenses £3435
was included among the assets at that
balance, but the last of it was wiped off the
books in 1920, along with £7051 of the good-
will. The latter still stands at £lO,OOO, but
it is offset by an undistributed balance of
£15142 (the £3500 put aside for taxation
is not included), which explains the L>l42
standing to reserves in the introductory table.
The new capital was not idle, as a compari-
son of gross profits bears witness :
1913 .. £15,563 1 1921 .. £49,849
1918 .. 46,337 | 1923 .. 111,631
1920 .. 89,659 I 1924 .. 126,008.
Thus out of the opportunities of war-time
has been built an Australian industry which,
ia the past 10 years, has kept in the Com-
monwealth £665.05S of manufacturing.profit,
in addition to the wages it has paid its lug
staff of contented workers, and the employ-
ment and profit it has provided in indirect
ways. ......

Inabilities include £112,409 bank overdraft;
find though it is a pleasing sign of the times
that banks are readier to lend support to
Australian manufacturers, dependence on
them has its dangers. However, £116,229 is
in bricks and mortar; and doubtless the
directors have had to look around for the
cheapest money they can get to help them
carry that burden. Their own funds being
thus liberated for employment in the business
proper, thev were able to show profits last
year equal' to 12.3 p.c. on capital and re-
serves, or, after satisfying the prefs. (some
of them a stiff 9 p.c.), 141 p.c. on ordinaries.
The co. was building up trade during the
period: the increase, despite strong compe-
tition from low-wage, long-hour overseas
manufactures, was £55,000. which, with the
increase of £4B 000 in 1923, represents an
expansion of £103.000 in two years. This
promises well. But there must be further
expansion, greater security of market and
less dependence on the bank before the co.
can be considered safe against possible
troubles like those of ’2l. Meantime, the
market views the shares with a favorable eye.

For the first time the accounts are made
available, the Board having decided to give
shareholders a free market by registering
on Sydney Stock Exchange. _ Both prets.
and ordinaries are listed. Paid capital is
£129,063, of which prefs. (8 p.c. cum.) stand
for £14,910. The history of 1v.F.8. is one
of the minor romances of Australian indus-
trial history. In February, 1916, during
the height of the war, with all the difficul-
ties of the period, and yet with all the Pro-
tection the necessities of the times afforded,
three employees of Metters, Ltd. (Keysor,
the general manager, and Forrest and Bar-
nett —hence the “K.F.8.”) set out to fight
for a share of the business in the old co. s
lines. Barnett later severed his connection
with the infant. With £lOOO of capital the
trio challenged the world. It was their good
fortune that most of the world at the time
was too busy to bother about Australian
markets, and the rest, found difficulty in get-
ting goods here. The result of the disloca-
tion of overseas trade was that both the old
firm and the young found a demand which
kept on doubling turnover, until to-day the
value of output in one enamelware line
exceeds total production of the pre-war
years. In the intervening years the share
capital of 1v.F.8. has expanded from the
£lOOO of its modest beginning to £129 063.
The young co. encouraged its employees to
take an interest in the business, and the re-
sult showed in an entire absence of indus-
trial trouble—the first incident in nine years
occurred since the close of the accounts.
During last financial term plant for mak-
ing leadless porcelain enamelled baths was
completed. The move was met by a minia-
ture price-war which badly injured net pro-
fits. Rates in some lines have been cut to
a level which represents a loss to makers,
and the public is benefiting. The result
shows in the accounts: a contributing factor
was the unproductive capital represented by
the cost of the new plant. However, interim
div. at the rate of 8 p.c. p.a. was paid on
both prefs. and ordinaries, the undistributed
balance from 1923 being drawn on to the
extent of £3459. Out of the £1163 remain-
ing, prefs. received the last of their div.

The quicker the last item is wiped out the
better. The good name of K.F.B. products
is worth something; it may # be worth a
great deal. But a manufacturing co. which
is up against, razor-keen competition is han-
dicapped when it has to earn profits on
capital represented by thin air. Lash hold-
ings at December 31 were very light, but
liquids and semi-liquids amounted to £67.142,
or £14,408 more than all liabilities, includ-
ing the last of the pref. div. Fixed assets
were in the books at £102.106. The Board
is satisfied with the outlook, and continues
to push ahead.

The profit claimed by the accounts for
last vear was greater than that of 19—0, the
figures being £23.868 and £21,214 respec-
tively But the Board is so intent on hiding
details from rival firms that it is impossible
to tell just what the actual position is at
each balancing date, although the introduc-
tory table indicates how the co. has moved
over the past eight years. Reserves might
be headed “approximate,” for out of the
unappropriated balance (which, with general
reserve of £22,189, makes the reserves of the
introductory table) has to come income-tax
and bonus to staff—unknown quantities each.
Still the matter rights itself in the following
year. The “marked improvement” over the
latter half of the year mentioned in the re-
port will be welcomed by shareholders. For
long the concern was a proprietary —David
Mitchell started the business in the golden
’sixties with money made at storekeepidg at
Ipswich (Q.) —but the public has been inter-
ested since 1913. At the peak of the post-
war boom the best that could be done was
9 p.c., but, as compensation, shareholders did
not go hungry in the slump period that fol-
lowed. Still 7 p.c. or even 71 p.c. is a poor
return from a trading co. these days., when
gilt-edged securities will give you 61 p.c.
Whether the improvement shown has a chance
of permanency is hard to say. The manage-
ment thinks so, but although the current
term should be good—it might even be better
than last year—further ahead is not so clear.
This can be said: the co. handles bread-and-
butter lines, and. although there is rarely any
fancy profit in them, on the other hand even
in bad times they have to be bought.
The co. has not stood still; its expansion
has been fairly consistent: —

Expenses have been travelling upward as
well, although last year showed a welcome
steadiness. There have been other improve-
ments. Factory premises, for instance, have
been at least doubled in the past five years,
and the co. owns a big block in the city
which it occupies for offices and stores, yet
the item appears in the books at less than
double the amount of four years ago. There
has been substantial expansion in most
figures since 1917 :

The accounts are not informative. Sundry
creditors is the only liability item. How
much is trading debt and how much mort-
gage can only be guessed at. Further,
sundry investments are grouped with book
debts, and those investments may be good
or bad, great or small. The item must con-
tain at least the amount which represents
Mitchell’s Factories. Ltd., a hefty pup. in
which the parent holds all the shares. Both
entries are bulky, but there is some padding
in each. Not that the dimensions are alarm-
ing when turnover is big—and David
Mitchell’s must be well over the million
mark. But the co. has to carry many store-
keepers, city and country, and at the close of
the year the money from the big wheat and
wool cheques had not completed the circle
back to the city. Country merchants who
have been carrying customers and have them-
selves been carried by the city have, however,
now started liquidating. That is another
factor which should favorably influence the
current term. More or less liquid assets as
at December 31 amounted to £417,557. or
twice the liabilities, leaving £210.564. nlus
fixed assets (written-down value £52,618),
less final appropriations, to represent share
capital. The co.’s position is solid, and
better returns to shareholders may arrive.
But the dry-goods business is not a great
money-spinner.

added £l5O. Ordinary expenditure was

having decided to retire on account of ill-
health, which for some time had debarred him
from active control. Assets, including for-
mula; and recipes at £2320, were £52.900 m
excess of liabilities, and that sum was pro-
posed as payment to the vendors. Although
the business had been running for 35 years,
apart from the £2325 nothing was asked
for goodwill. Lack of support resulted

in that prospectus being withdrawn. In
September another was issued. This time
only £30.000 in prefs. was sought from the
public, the rate was lifted to 10 p.c. cum.,
and that amount was the cash consideration
to Max Wurcker. In addition, he took 5400
ordinaries, while 17,500 ords. went to other
vendors. The rate was high, there seemed
plenty of security for the pref. capital, and
the return over a long period had been good;
so the amount asked was subscribed, lhere
was not much to spare of last year s profits,
but £2lBl for flotation expenses is a non-
recurring item. As matters stand, there is
the undistributed balance of £546 to offset
the £2325 of intangibles, which makes the
net. deficit £1779. - The security for the
£30,000 of prefs. is stock £19,557, amounts
owing on hire purchase £37,678, and machin-
ery and fittings £B644—a total of £65,879,
which, less liabilities, is equal to £2 Is. lOd.
per share. Though the community won t
always have so much easy money to spend
on luxuries, the past record of the firm
suggests that the £3OOO p.a. necessary to
pay the pref. div. should be fairly easy.

On page 17 of this issue, in the analysis
of the I’elaco Co., a pretty obvious error
occurs in the last column of the preliminary
table. Not reckoning goodwill as an asset,
it was, as the subsequent entries show, a
deficit of £I2,7SS which the co. had at the
end of 1918.

Menzies Consolidated (W.A.), after a long
struggle, was nearly abandoned two years
ago owing to poor prospects. Now, as the
result of a new find at depth, the directors
have bucked up, say it would have been
wicked to give up, and talk of doing well in
the future. To date shareholders have
received very little, but the mine, like the
Sons of Gwalia and several others in the
West, has been the main support of a small
community for many years, so the State
Government recently gave a hand with deeper
development.
* * * *
Freney Oil Co. (W.A.) has £20.000 in
hand, and proposes to ask Prime Minister
Bruce in Perth this month for a. £ for £
subsidy to bore to success or failure. It
bases its claim for Federal assistance on
the belief, supported to some extent by Dr.
Wade, that it has the best prospects of any
oil-searching venture in the Commonwealth.
At the shareholders’ meeting chairman
Nicholson was rough on American expert
Clapp for “a breach of professional etiquette
in damning a property which he had not been
nearer than 100 miles.”

Peak Hill (W.A.) is again producing a
little gold. The field was first worked in
the middle ’nineties by a couple of prospec-
tors returning south from Kimberley, and
after getting a lot of gold they sold out to
Darlington Simpson, a London co. promoter,
who floated his purchase for a quarter of a
million'. There were flourishing times with
occasional divs. for a few years ; then adver-
sity butted in and disaster followed. Simp-
son is best remembered in the West ns the
man who banquetted Gov. Jerry Smith on
solid rough-cast gold plates, and provided
him with a golden spittoon when lie visited
(and, incidentally, bought shares in) the
mine.
* * * *
The Wiluna people (W.A.) are sinking
their big main shaft in record time. The
reward of success will be big. London hav-
ing agreed to put up £300,000 should the
shaft confirm the values disclosed by the drill
at 300 ft. It is expected 300 ft. will be reached
by May 1; when the heavy Wiluna water is
met with at about 210 ft., the rate of sinking
will slow down. However, the crowd knows
its job. From the Wiluna shaft the Emu
Mining Co. can be seen on the sky line
boring for any good things the Wiluna pegs
may have missed. Emu bore is down 100
feet, so it is also stepping out fast for the
300 ft. mark.
* * * ♦
Brilliant (W.A.) took the risk of pur-
chasing the Gnow’s Nest mine against the
advice of the man it paid to investigate the
show, so the Board should cease squealing
now that the chickens are coming home to
roost. The directors were told plainly that
the show was exhausted above the 2Soft.
level and that it would cost £BOOO to fix up
the plant decently and sink to and open out
the 380 ft. level. Notwithstanding this and
much more, they blundered on while vendors
pocketed cash-purchase instalments as they
came due. Already £7OOO has been expended
on plant adjustment and 50ft. of shaft sink-
ing. Water is heavy, ground hard and the
reef still far off. It is all very depressing.
One set of directors resigned on hearing the
truth about the business, but another crowd
was enticed into the mess.
Big Great Victoria lode, South Yilgarn
(W.A.), has kept a number of deserving
owners poor for a quarter of a century. Re-
cently a Kalgoorlie crowd brought some
money and brains to the show, and at last
it has been made to yield a decent profit—
over £lOOO per month for two successive
months. The main thing in working the
show successfully is to sort out the payable
portions from the huge mass. Apart from the
lode itself, there is a big shallow area on
the surface that has been apparently en-
riched by gold leaching from the lode and re-
precipitating. Values in this area average
about 255., and as total working costs are
only 16s. per ton, the show will have a pay-
able run for some time.
* * * *
Adelaide option-seekers are reported to
have their eyes on two “promising” shows
on Yilgarn goldfield (W.A.). One is a
newly-prospected venture at Nevona and the
other Radio Deeps at Manxman. Some time
ago the Radio, which adjoins the Deeps, was
inspected on behalf of an Adelaide, co. by
two competent mining-men, who voiced the
general opinion that, although the gold was
there, the price asked for it (£40,000) was
too much. Although the Deeps is something
more than a hole in the ground, its future
is largely dependent on getting the continua-
tion of some of the Radio’s wealth at depth
—a prospect on which an option-holding co.
might work up a little market enthusiasm.

Since directors addressed a rapturous
Perth meeting of Borneo . Oil. Syndicate
shareholders as brother-millionaires in em-
bryo, matters have moved along satisfac-
torily. The 1000 reserve shares issued on
January 30 at a premium of 50s. each have
been applied for, providing a welcome £5OOO.
Directors Williams and Crawcour, forti-
fied by an encouraging report by Dutch geo-
logist Hogenraad, are in Melbourne with no
other desire than to let investors there in
on the good thing. There is a considerable
quantity of oil in the way of seepages on
the surface of the concessions, and oil-
bearing sands have been proved by boring.
Hogenraad states he is confident a spouter
will be struck if a suitable bore is drilled at
the place he indicates.

United Gleesons, at Ten Mile (Vic.), on
the way to Gaffney’s Creek and Wood’s
Point, lias a brilliant history as a producer
divided between two veterans —United Glee-
sons and the Sailor Bill cos. In the very
early days, from shallow depth, soz to lOoz.
yields were taken according to ancient re-
cords. One tunnel, the Hungarian, is in
2360 ft., and was only stopped for want of
air. An air compressor and suction-gas
engine are being installed, and then No. 2
shoot under the Hungarian tunnel will be
stoped and crushing resumed. The co. is in
a good financial position, and the mine is in
the capable hands of Archie Hay, manager
for years of the Bullfinch (W.A.).
* * * *
Golden Stairs, Greensbdrough, 14 miles
from Melbourne, seems to have opened up
one of those rich shoots in narrow reefs
for which the district has been notable since
1852. There was one big mine at Diamond
Creek, a few miles away, the Union, which
yielded a large quantity of gold from a true
fissure lode. A fire cleaned out the plant,
and the mine has been closed since. The
Golden Stairs is still a shallow mine, the
adit being 98ft., with a winze 34ft. A reef
Sin. wide carries a little gold, and a north
drive struck a 2ft. reef carrying payable
stone. In this district the reefs are near
the. surface, easily found and easily worked.
It is ideal country for co-operative parties
of miners, who have the use of a Govern-
ment battery.
* * » *
A new gold find is reported from Cannin-
dali, back of Gladstone (Q.). on the Dawes
Range, alongside of which the new North
Burnett railway passes. The reef can be
traced for 200 yards, and a shaft has been
sunk 35ft. on a 12in. vein from which pros-
pects up to soz. have been obtained. A trial
crushing is being sent to Gympie, but until
more prospecting is done and definite values
known it is impossible to say whether tho
find is of any importance. Prospecting for
other reefs in the vicinity appears to be
worth while.
• * • •
Orallo No. 2 bore, Roma (Q.), is now
down just below 2000 ft., but very little
public interest, even in Queensland, is shown
in its prospects. Another 300 ft.-should take
it to where Milsom claimed he had an oil-
sand, 70ft. to SOft. thick, the equal to any-
thing he had seen in America. R. E. Allan,
in charge of operations, is more cautious,
and is not predicting ahead of the drill. The
next couple of weeks should show whether
there was anything to get excited about in
No. 1 bore.

The high-level tin-bearing gravels around
the Three Castles and Fifteen-mile Creek on
Kangaroo Hills (N.Q.) are to be attacked in
earnest this year by the Castles Dredging
Co., with every prospect of success, despite
past failures by others. There has never
been any doubt as to values in the wash, but
cash available hitherto has been insufficient
to handle the water difficulty. The new co.
has a large Babcock boiler, and a Beiliss
Morcom marine engine off the old H.M.A.S.
Australia will drive the pumping plant and
supply 75,000ga15. per hour from Oakey
Creek, distant three miles, to a high-level
reservoir. The Three Castles will be the
first ground to be treated.
From the field :
Isa Prop, started to diamond drill the Ibus on
February-22, and crosscutting at No. 1 shaft conse-
quently stopped, after proving 110 ft. of payable ore
at the 175 level, the western face being in 38.88
per cent, lead, 25.660 z. silver and 10.87 p.c. zinc.
Ibus No. 3 shaft east crosscut face is in ore bulking
26.46 p.c. lead and 5.330 z. silver. Out On Her
Own No. 2 shaft is down 184 ft. in good ore from
surface. The Ibus to 200 ft. has on E. J. J.
Rodda’s figures over a million tons, and double that
if the ore outcropping for a width of 200 ft. persists
in depth. The Black Star will probably duplicate
this quantity of ore, making a’ certain 2,000,000 tons
to 200 ft. as proved by crosscuts, with a probable
further 2,000,000 tons if depth is true to outcrop.
To mine this under cover, using timber and mullock,
will be an expensive game, and down to 100 ft. at
least the Ibus of the Proprietary Co. and the Black
Star of the Isa Mines, Ltd., are steam-shovel propo-
sitions.
Vegetable Creek yields from the Cherry,
at Ardlethan (N.S.W.), continue to dwindle.
The current fortnightly report still speaks
of both the east and west pipes as being
“poor grade, without improvement.” Since
July these pipes have given the following:—
Dried
1924. Ore. Concentrates.
July 28 .. .. .. 167 tons. 13.95 tons.
Aug. 28 201 15.95
Sept. 25 190 16.1
Oct. 23 191 12.75
Nov. 20 237 11.7
1925.
Feb. 5 (7 weeks) .. 229 9.65
March 5 216 5.2
The figures indicate, after all, that The
Bulletin’s forecast of “about four months’ ”
good ore in these pipes was near the mark,
despite the official anger displayed at the
time.

The Crown (N.S.W.) tragedy went from
bad to worse last Thursday, when an auc-
tioneer offered over 26.000 shares forfeited
because the fourth call of 3d. hadn’t been
paid; and nobody made a bid. Most people
have read between the lines of Gundy’s
report.
* * * *
Tingha Tin (N.S.W.) slipped back to
7000 yards in February from the high level of
10,500 in January. Mine profit was £7OO in
January and only £225 in February. Instal-
lation of a larger turning engine may improve
the next yield.

Riverina Collieries, Coorabin (N.S.W.). is
finding it hard to raise the £20,000 (in de-
bentures) needed, to punch the main shaft
down to the seam and “thoroughly equip”
the colliery. At the annual meeting in Mel-
bourne the chairman gave the mournful in-
formation that unless the money was put up
immediately the mine would have to be closed
down ; only £5900 had been applied for. Dur-
ing the year the Coorabin shaft was reopened
and output amounted to 1115 tons. The
coal was tested at Cock's Pioneer (Vic.)
and answered requirements. It seems absurd
to balk at this stage, seeing that the main
shaft is within 4ft. of the seam. On the
other hand, unless the co. is assured of a
market shareholders might as well stop at
4ft. as at any other point.
* * * *
Stackpool’s Crystal is a Cabbage Garden
venture at Ardlethan (N.S.W.), which so
far has not done well. From the 200 ft.
level 200 tons of ore is at grass, and is ex-
pected to bring in £2500. The worst feature
is that shoots of ore are short and erratic,
so that there has to be groping for ore all
the time. Still things look a bit better of
late, and the man in charge is crosscutting
south-west from the 200 ft. level to see
whether two runs of porphyry outcropping
at the surface Jive down and carry tin. It
is a hazard to do the work; but lode-tin
mining is always a matter of surprises—
mostly unpleasant.

Buck is favoring Vic.-owned Adelong Creek
(N.S.W.). In June it began in a 6d. patch,
but then eased into 4d. wash. Now it shows an
improvement of 90 per cent, on June values.
Only one plant is operating, and as bore results
ahead are high the old show looks to be in
for a spell of good yields. Deep work has
to be done, so 24 heavy buckets are on the
ladder to add to dredging capacity. Costs
run out at about a cub. yd. as against
an average return for the last six months
of 6d. If the last returns of lid. a yd. can
be at all maintained, it won’t be long before
the banker will be shot on to the dump.

North Blocks, Broken Hill, has installed
engine and compressor, rock-drills and pump
and the water is now under control. For
“vigorous development” 250 of the £5 shares
were offered and taken: of the 4500 shares
3000 have now been issued.

With platinum around £3O an ounce,
miners on the Fifield-Burra field, near Parkes
(N.S.W.), aredoingwell. So far approximately
10.0000 z., valued at about £350,000, has
been taken out, and this without any attempt
at a systematic working of the field. In
former days the prospectors were unmerci-
fully exploited, buyers giving as little as £5
or £6 per oz. Nowadays, however, tho
miners are too well-informed to be caught
for anything less than full prices.
Medway Colliery, which started last year
in a gorge off Medway Creek (N.S.W.),
opened on a bed of coal from 12 to 14 feet
thick. There is 6ft. of clean coal, a thin
band of clay, another foot of clean coal, and
tho rest poor stuff. The work is still in the
development stage; the most import-
ant work so far is a 12 x 6 tunnel in
800 ft. The co.’s holding is about 6000 acres.
The transport and marketing arrangements
might be a lot better: the mineral is hauled
by motor-lorries 12 miles to Moss Vale; but
it is intended to construct an aerial across
the gorge to the terminus of the old private
railway from Bong Bong. The same pro-
prietary proposes the erection of cement
works between Berrima and Moss Yale.
Shale deposits have been secured, and lime-
stone will be brought from Marulan.

MISS EDITH ONIONS, secretary of the

Frank Brennan, the new Queensland
Judge, has struck a difficulty. He served
articles in Warwick, and became a solicitor
in 1911. He practised in Warwick and else-
wdiere until last year, when he applied to be
admitted to the Bar (without examination).
He was duly admitted and struck off the roll
of solicitors._ But the Supreme Court Act
of 1867 provides that only a barrister of five
years’ standing, or a solicitor five years in
practice, may be a Judge. Brennan has not
been a barrister for the requisite time, nor
is he on the solicitors’ roll. Hence he must
apply to be disbarred and put back on the
roll of solicitors; and then somebody will
raise the point -whether he is a solicitor of
five years’ standing. It may be contended
that his standing dates only from his re-
admission.
There are only three survivors of the 45
delegates to the six -weeks’ Australasian Fed-
eration Convention which opened at Sydney
March 2. 1891, with Parlies in the chair.
They are Wm. McMillan (Ma State) and
I)r. J. A. Coekburn (S. Aus.), each in his
75th year, and A. J. Thynne (Q.), in his
7Sth. George Grey was one of the three
Maorilanders present.
Mrs. H. W. Parker, the sister of Lord
Kitchener, who was 78 when the call came
the other day. lived for many years on Little
Roderick station, up the Waitaki River, near
Oamaru (M.L.). During his Australasian
tour the War Lord spent a pleasant holiday
with her. A daughter of Mrs. Parker showed
the fighting strain by becoming a militant
suffragette. Mrs. Parker nurtured to the
last the quaint belief that her great brother
was a prisoner in Germany.
Melbourne City Council did not give the
principle of “equal pay for equal work’’ any
sort of a look-in
when it first fixed
the salary of its
lady doctor, Dr. A.
D. Hensley, at a
miserly £250 a
year; but it has
made some amends
by taking the figure
to £5OO in one lift.
It was enthusiasm
that induced Dr.
Hensley to stick to
her job; and she
has been putting-
fine energy into a
campaign against
diphtheria in the
city area.
IF. HERBERT
PHILLIPPS, chair-
man of the 'Savings

Every Laborite carries a Cabinet portfolio
in his tucker-tin. Works Minister Kirwin,
of Bananaland, has just proved it. He was
pegging boots at 11, and then drifted to
barrow-pushing at the Central Railway Sta-
tion, Brisbane. Soon his spare time was
spent at St. Brigid's Parliamentary Debat-
ing Society, and thence onwards he has been
a hard-drinker of political poteen.
The recent Angaston (S.A.) wine-show
brought up memories of George Fife Angas,
who about 1850 sent over to Westralia for
cuttings from vines; they had been brought
from Spain and Portugal by military offi-
cers of the newly-established convict settle-
ment there. The cuttings were handed over
to Samuel Smith, and he and his family to
the fourth generation have been wine-making
ever since. Some of the original vines are
still bearing.
Edward Reeves, dead in Adelaide at 63,
was a notable elocutionist. He spent his
boyhood in M.L., was a Sydney journalist
for a time, just missed going to New Aus-
tralia in Paraguay, and settled in Adelaide
30 years ago as a voice-trainer. A prodigious
memory was his strong suit, and he tackled,
as lately as last month, wdiole evenings of
Dickens or Shakspeare, “Brigadier Gerard”
or “The Sky Pilot.”
As an aid to longevity there are few T things
to compare with a pension. Died the other
day at Brighton, England, Dr. George Att-
field, who was medical officer at the Imperial
convict establishment in Fremantle (W.A.)
so long ago that about the only thing remem-
bered about him is that he patronised the
turf (what little there was of it in those
remote days) and shot snipe on Rottnest
Island when he wasn’t diagnosing prisoners’
ailments or certifying that hangings had
been carried out with precision. The doctor
retired in ’76. eight years after convict trans-
portation ceased, and returned to England
with an Imperial pension. He drew it for
48 years, passing out at. 99.
Dear Bulletin, —The paragraph (B.
12/2/’25) announcing my retirement from
all business activity is premature. It anti-
cipates an event which may occur about 12
years hence. Whilst the A.I.F. Canteens
Trust, of which I am chairman, has dis-
tributed over £700.000 in aiding 45,000 dis-
abled soldiers and dependents of deceased
soldiers in need of assistance, there is still
a balance of £38.000 left for that purpose.
In addition, the Trust administers the truly
noble bequest of the late Samuel McCaughey
which, with interest, will total about
£(300.000. This will enable the. trustees to
materially aid in the technical education of
at least 15.000 soldiers’ children, of whom
we have over 3000 on our books at the pre-
sent moment. When that work is finished
it is possible, though not at all certain, I
may be finally “out of a job.”—Yours, N. C.
Lockyek.
R. Gillies, of the Tweed, one of the nomi-
nated Labor men to contest Byron (N.S.W.),
need not be discouraged because of his rejec-
tion on account of not being long enough in
the movement. His brother was twice defeated
on the rivers, and now is Queensland Pre-
mier.
M.L. Premier Massey has had a stormy
passage through months of sickness, and
made his first public appearance for several
weeks when the Aorangi arrived at Welling-
ton. The once stalwart frame was not equal
to the journey up the gangway, and he, con-
tented himself with a survey of the wonder-
ship from his motor-car. The illness is
doubly unfortunate, for this is election year
in Maoriland.
The new superintendent of Adelaide Hos-
pital is to be Dr. .T. Gordon llislop, who
earned his first medical degree at Melbourne,
fought influenza at Broadmeadows Camp
and later in Hobart, and has since had Eng-
lish experience in Manchester and London.
Recently he has had charge of the Children's
Hospital at Perth.
The late Sir John Cowans, the General
“X” of a recent unsavory London case, was
mixed up with another scandal in 1916. A
court of inquiry proved that Cowans, who
was Quartermaster-General of the British
Army, was improperly influenced by Mrs.
Cornwallis West to secure the promotion,
and later (when it suited her) the degrada-
tion, of a young Irish officer. The court
remarked on Cowans’s indiscretion and
departure, from offiqial propriety, but the
War Office retained him in his job “on
account of his great services.”
Australia has some woman workers to be
proud of. One of them is Miss Annie
Middlemist, of Sale (Vic.). Commencing
as a State, teacher in the ’sixties, under the
old denominational system, and passing on
to service under the State system which suc-
ceeded it, the lady earned through the years
the reputation of being one of the most emi-
nent of the fine band of Victorian women
teachers. To-day she still rides a push-bike
through the streets of Sale, and is as insis-
tent in all good works as she was during
the war, when she was Gippsland’s leading
Red Cross organiser and worker.

John Chatham, who was Labor member
for Grenville in the Vic. Leg. Assembly dur-
ing the first three years of the Big Scrap,
died the othe.r day. He was a good type, but
disagreed with Labor on the Conscription
issue and was dropped for a poorer man.
Philip J. Newland, of Roseville, became a
member of the Sydney School of Arts in
1854—71 years ago. His father proposed
him as a quarterly member and two years
later paid the £5 for life membership. That
ought to be not only an Australian but a
world's record.
. E. .Cornish has just celebrated his
jubilee with the Rundle-street drapery firm

It now owns the whole block from Gawler-
place to Stephens-place, and occupies most
of it; and Cornish is general manager.

F. L. W. Ashby, secretary of Vic. Chamber
of Manufactures, has earned the nine months’
holiday and trip to America and Europe he
has been granted. In addition to full pay
he has been given £lOOO towards the exes, of
himself and wife. The Chamber was a small
show when Ashby got hold of it, and it is
now a tremendous force. Ashby began by

Coming to Australia from the Old Country
years ago, an omnivorous reader and a
ready talker, he for many years carried on
Sunday-afternoon debates on all manner of
subjects in Prince Alfred Park. Several

landed there, he would have made a rattling

orthodox obstructionist lines. George

last few, simple, direct and impressive words
over him.
Some of Adelaide’s oldest legal names go
off the register under an amalgamation of
firms just announced. Fenn and Hardy was
a partnership going back to the very early
days. Grundy, K.C., and Polly built up a
big business later. Just lately Burton Hardy
has combined the two as Grundy, Pelly and
Hardy. He now drops the old names, and
combines with a more modern firm as
Scammell, Hardy and Skipper.
“Wild Cat” intelligence from W.A.: —-
Perth hopes to raise at least £lOOO so that
Veronica Mansfield, a W.A. song-bird, may study in
Italy. Debenture bonds are to be issued, redeemable
in three years. The co.’s sole asset is to be insured,
so that contributors may be safeguarded in the
event of her death. The lady is floating well; £5OO-
- of promises have already been received and
success seems assured. Amy Castles described the
young singer’s voice as a most beautiful mezzo-
soprano with a delightful lower register. As happened
in Amy’s own case, a priest, Rev. P. Verling, is
behind the float, which also has the support ot
Senator Paddy Lynch and the Mayors of Perth,
Subiaco and Cottesloe.
A fierce controversy is raging over Mrs.
John Jones, the wfife of the St. Kilda (Tie.)
parson whose churchwardens object to her
political aspirations; and it has caused much
trouble in another household. People who
are annoyed at what has happened, and wish
to tell Mrs. Jones that their sympathy is
with her, turn up the telephone book and
look for the ’phone number of the Rev. John
Jones. There is a full column of John
Joneses in the Melbourne directory, and a
dozen of the same name in the 'phone list,
and probably 75 per cent, of the callers ring
the number which is down against Rev. John
Jones, St. Kilda. The lady’s husband, how-
ever, is described merely as Rev. J. Jones,
vicarage. St. Kilda. The other Jones is a
“dissenting” minister.
The burning of the Melbourne Town Hall
gave William Rodier a chance to light a
flare of his own; in a new leaflet, “Town
Halls to Burn,” he affirms that by destroy-
ing its rats any city can save enough money
to buy Town Halls by the dozen. Rodier,
who lias been advocating his system of rabbit
and rat destruction (by the elimination of
the females and the encouragement of males)
for over 30 years, runs a business as a farm
salesman in Collins-street; but the Rodier
system is his real life-job. Like many whole-
souled propagandists, he has lost some sense
of proportion and even temperance ot expres-
sion when he is on his pet subject; and his
propaganda, still maintained constantly, is
full of invective against the State and civic
authorities who refuse to be converted. All
the same, the Rodier method —which is a
good deal older, by the way, than Rodier—
has never been given an extensive trial, not-
withstanding that in a small way, in re-
stricted netted farm areas, it has been suc-
cessful.

You’re young and rather choice.
Attend the sale in person
And hear the bids that rise.
That last ten quid was hers, son;
And you're the special prize.

He’s free from tricks and vice.
“At sixteen-fifty! Going!
Yes, sixteen-sixty—-thanks 1

And all he wins he banks.

You’d make a splendid pair!
“Thirty-four hundred ! Take him.
He’s yours, miss—hat and all.
He’ll turn out what you make him.

LONG BOB (to local J.P.): Conme on now, ’ome[?]you go. We
don't want you to ’u[?]e a bad head when we’re brought
up before you in the morning”
“Wonkonguru”: My experience, gained
during 20-odd years of cons/abulary work iwas very
different from that of “Up/Top” (B. 22/1/T25). In
my period of service I bjnried (fight men \who had
died of thirst. In not a Single cfese did th !y circle,
and only one stripped. He was an Afghan who
perished, in 1905, betiween Tarcoola (S. &.) and
Murat Bay. Directly lie found that he was tlost he
struck out westward in a straight line until? he got
near enough to a loaf-shaped rock to identify it; he
then turned north searching for the rockhole from
which he had started. Going west again he missed it
by a mere 200 yards. I found him finally about 40
miles north-west of the rockhole, under a big pine
tree. His tracks showed that he had gone almost
straight north until he died. Before the end came
he buried his clothes in the sand. Another, a Sikh
shepherd, was missed from the mail change at Goy-
der’s Lagoon. I followed his tracks for about 10
miles south and lost them opposite the seven-mile
bore. We searched the lignum for two days but
could not pick up his tracks again. He was found
six months afterwards only a few hundred yards from
where I had lost his tracks; he had travelled in an
almost straight line. Four others died in their
camps—they had travelled towards water as long as
they could and had then turned in to wait for it.
One had gone under with a waterhole 21 miles long
about four miles to the east, and another six miles
long to the west. He had struck in between the
two and, judging by his tracks, had been afraid to
leave the straight south line that he was making.
A second had apparently lost his camel from a camp
at a salt-water hole on the Cooper. Ho put in his
time digging 1 soaks until he could dig no more. If
he had gone either up or down the Cooper he would
have got through.
* * * *
“Nin”: The giant groper mentioned by
“Akran” (B. 12/2/’25) has disappeared from the
neighborhood of Harwood (N.S.W.). Several ama-
teurs have hooked him, but he played with a couple
of hundred yards of stout line as though it were
cotton. He was last seen heading for Maclean. It
is now believed that had he been caught and opened
up his inside would have been found to contain a
fully-equipped hydro-electric scheme.
* * * *
“Billy See”; What weight can the ship of
the desert shift? The old Coolgardie record of
9141 b., exclusive of saddle, was held by a bull-
camel owned by Tagh Mahomet; the burden was car-
ried over the nearly waterless stretch to Kurnalpi,
something like 70 miles by camel-pad. Have Abdul
Wade and other eastern-State carriers ever done
better ?
* * * *
“Six and Eight”: The 25 snakelets taken
from the black wriggler killed at Gatton, Q.
til. 19/2/’25) are nothing to write home about.
Thirty-five were removed from one bashed at Willewa
Creek (N.S.W.). Australian snakes are more pro-
lific in colder latitudes. Where the mainland Tiger
matron produces 30, the Speck variety puts up
scores of 40, sometimes 50.
* * * *
“Jesmond”: “Larrapinta’s” method of pre-
venting adobe walls crumbling (B. 12/2/’25) is but
a partial remedy, for there is nothing in the compo-
sition of the walls below the dampeourse to check
their decay, and walls are useless without founda-
tions. The best plan is to make a foundation of
well-cemented stqne, brick or, best of all, concrete,
and then build with adobe on top of the damp-
course. But prospective builders should make sure
that the climate is suitable for adobe houses, for
the principal cause of their disintegration is a humid
atmosphere, and not the magnesia in the soil-
moisture creeping up. Adobe houses require a dry
climate.
* * * *
“Larrapinta”: In the autumn, when the
water in the Murray and its
tributaries is low and clear,
angling with bait and line is
a tedious business. If one
wants fish at this time, and
is sportsman enougli not to
use the illegal spinner, here's
the way to do it. Punch a lot of
small holes in an old bucket,
tie a piece of meat in the
bottom, hitch a rope to the
handle, ani sink it in the
river. Draw it up in an hour's
time, let the water drain
away, and you’ll find dozens
of shrimps in the bottom. Use
a line without a sinker, and
one small hooK. Armed with
line, shrimps and a lantern
or bicycle-lamp, go to the
nearest deep pool about 9
o’clock at night, set the light
down on the bank, and screen
the rays with a piece of bark
or tin, so that only a few
square feet of water is illumi-
nated. In a few minutes
hordes of shrimps appear on
the surface and begin to circle
round in the patch of light,
and in a few more minutes
bream and callop begin to dart
up to the surface and grab the
shrimps. Now’s your chance.
Stick a shrimp on your hook,
throw it out, and draw it
slowly across the illuminated
water. In half an hour, un-
less your luck is out, you'll
have enough to give all hands
a fish breakfast next morning.
“Saaedi”: Though male and female emu
take turns at sitting on the eggs (B. 5/2/’25), the
lady has charge of the chicks. The old man hangs
round in the interest of respectability or something,
but he is much less formidable than his mate, so
she is naturally boss during the infant’s most
perilous period. Stupid as she is, the mother emu
exhibits great courage in protecting her progeny.
She will fight almost anything in their defence.
“C. Coral”: Johnny Mari, of Waraber
Island, Torres Strait, had a little extra in the way
of adventure thrown his way the other day. Johnny
had been visiting Coconut, a score of miles distant,
and set off in his dinghy for home, laden with
parcels of “tin cake, biscuit, calico, some bag flour,
corn-beef tin,” and other odds and ends. On the

DAD: “Well, hand it over. You’re a fool hangin' on to it for ten years.”
way he was unlucky enough to meet a squall which
had a waterspout concealed in its interior, and
Johnny’s craft turned turtle and went to the bottom,
leaving Johnny himself with only a paddle to con-
tinue his voyage. Fearing sharks, he did not ven-
ture to swim, but simply floated. He was carried
up on to a sandbank, where he subsisted on shellfish
and turtle eggs. Finding a big log, he contrived
to get it into the water, secured sidepieces to it by
means of vines growing along the beach —this to pre-
vent it from rolling—made himself clothing out of the
same vines and set out once more for home. He
turned up at Coconut a week from the day he had
left it, parched, and burned even blacker than
originally by the sun, most of the time having been
spent in paddling and floating; the strong tides
carried him miles away to the eastward. It took
six natives to drag Johnny’s log ashore, but the
mariner himself was frisky enough to join in the
festive dances next day.

“Nitric” ; “AdeL” asks if any fish other
than the cod bury themselves in the mud and thus sur-
vive drought (B. 12/2/’25). Yes; the lung-fish, alias
mud-fish, alias Burnett salmon. In the rivers of
Bananaland (especially the Burnett, the Mary and
the Burdekin) it is generally found in muddy back
waters or reedy side channels. In these lung-fish
the air-bladder is modified and acts as rudimentary
lungs, being connected with the gullet. Hence they
can stand drought periods even better than the cod,
which is in all essentials a true fish, with no
leaning towards the amphibians.
“The Joiner”: It was in the Mallee district
of S.A., and a party of woodcutters had put in some
strenuous work on a keg of pinkie from Loxton.
Biding along on Sunday evening at sundown I was
surprised to meet two of them, haggard and unkempt,
driving an aggrieved-looking horse and creaky dray
down the sandy track. I hailed them. “What?” I
said. “Going stump-carting at sundown on a Sun-
day, Albert?” The driver blinked incredulously at
me. “Sunday? Sundown?” he repeated. “Strike
me, I thought it was the sun risin’ to-morrow.”

“Booth B.”: Will “Thistle” (B. 12/2/’2o)
tell me what size charge of dynamite it was that
the stockman shot the fish with ? I have shot fish
in rivers and in salt water for many years, and
have never heard echoes from the explosion; never
heard much more than a thudding sort of noise. Nor
have I ever known of a fish, or anything else being
propelled from the water. My charge was always
a 2oz. plug, with detonator and 4in. of fuse attached.
With that I secured more than a thousand mackerel
on one occasion, and 63 large-sized mullet on another.
♦ * * *
“Rita C.”: I disagree with “Curlew” (B.
12/2/’25) when he says a “blue tongue” is a
station manager. From the days when flash shearers
called “Tar, boy, and spring back; I hate the smell
of a rouseabout,” the shed-hand has always been
known as a “blue tongue.” In south-west Queens-
land many station managers are known as “the big
cog.” This title was originally earned by Clement
Ladbury, of Milo, who explained to a station-hand
that everyone working on the place was a “cog in
the machine.” “And I,” he added, “am the big
cog.” The name has stuck.
ISitnc ; Yarrum’s” apricot-tree must be
pollinated, and hence fertilised, before it will bear
ci! 1 5/2/’25). Previous to his cutting the
other trees out the pollination would be mutual or
cross between these trees, and evidently self-pollina-
lon is impossible in the case of the apricot. This
is also the fact with many fruit-trees, but. curiously
enough, there are exceptional species where self-
pollination is possible. Take, for instance, the paw-
paw tree. Sometimes female trees will not bear
fruit unless surrounded by the male trees, but, again,
some trees are hermaphrodite, or bi-sexual, and fruit
prolifieally, though, as a rule, the fruit is not as
good as from cross-fertilisation. There is one other
botanical explanation of “Yarrum’s” barren tree.
Self-fertilisation is only possible when the male and
female reproductive organs mature simultaneously.
Seasonal variation may bring about a later develop-
ment of one or the other, with consequent fruit-
lessness.
* * * *
“X2X”: “Sax’s” theory that mosquitoes
will suck out the poison they have injected, if allowed
to bite a victim unmolested (B. 5/2/’25), is wide
of the mark. When a mosquito bites it injects, before
drawing blood, a secretion which is believed to
render the blood less coagulable and so easier to
draw out. This secretion, which really causes the
irritation, gets into the blood stream, save for a
small quantity withdrawn with the blood, and is
quickly distributed through the entire system, so
that it would be an impossibility for the insect to
suck it out again. In tropical countries, where
mosquitoes are not only very numerous but very
large, there have been cases of men dying from

poisoning by this secretion (really a toxin) after
they had lain unconscious in the open, where thev
were at the mercy of swarms of the pests. Yet if
there were anything in “Sax’s” theory the more
they were bitten the less inosquito-toxin there would
be in their blood.

THE HUNG ALOW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
AVe’ve watched it growing day by day.
A year ago the ground was bare;
A'ow, latticed, porehed and gable-roofed,
Our bungalow is standing fair.
Amid the piles of builder’s waste
And plumber’s scraps of curling tin,
While sniffing smells of pine and paint,
The family’s busy moving in.
Spotted and spattered are the floors,
With blue and mauve and black and white,
Like some crude picture of the sky
Set with a maze of stars at night;
Smudges are on your cheek and chin,
Limp is the overall you wear;
Walnut and oak stain soil your hands,
Cold-water paint is in your hair.
The children scamper in and out;
One rompered urchin rides a broom;
Doors slam and bang as they pass through
At hide and seek, from room to room ;
One toddler waddles here and there,
His legs wide spread lest he should fall,
And tiny fingers leave their print
Around the newly-painted wall.
Our furniture seems old and worn,
And in your eyes I read distress;
The morning sun, that lights the room,
Shows up its awful shabbiness
Amid surroundings new and fresh;
The kitchen stove still smells of tar ;
The battered home-made stools nnl chairs
And creaky table seem to jar.
The ragged oilcloth has been cut
In Vs and squares to make it fit;
With threadbare parts well out of sight
We’ve matched the (Cittern, bit by bit.
We’ve black japanned the iron beds
And walnut-stained those made of wood ;
The front-room suite is English oak—
We bought that once when times were good.
Long have we dreamed of such a home,
And now at last our dreams come true ;
All through the years we struggled on
Hope was a wondrous thing in you.
We’ll have the garden as we planned
In those old days so long ago,
W ith trellised arches over paths
That lead you to the bungalow.

GENUINE BALLOON TIRES
STANDARD EQUIPMENT
The 7 Passenger
Phaeton
Greatest Kilue HUDSON Ever Offered/
Hudson’s consistent leadership in value is emphasized again in the
adoption of genuine balloon tires as standard equipment on all models.
Do not confuse with “semi-balloon” types. Hudson s are genuine
balloon tires. Compare the difference. Also note that Hudson has
not simply “added balloon tires.” Both running and steering gear
have been specially designed for the radical differences balloon tires
bring. The result is the easiest steering and riding Hudson ever built.
In All Wavs a Finer SUPER-SIX
Note that in Hudson this costlier tire
equipment is not reflected in the price.
It merely adds another factor of con-
trast to Hudson’s advantage of low cost
among fine quality cars.
Of course, as always, Hudson’s chief
advantage is in the superiority of me-
chanical design and construction.
In speed, acceleration, hill-climbing and
endurance it holds marks that are
famous among all stock cars. Many of
its official records have never been
equalled by any car regardless of price.
In this territory, as elsewhere through-
out the world, the great number of
Hudsons you see in service is the best
proof of the value and satisfaction they
consistently render. Greater fuel and
oil mileage, exceptionally low cost for
replacement parts, and easy accessibil-
ity give the new Hudson remarkable
economy of maintenance and operation.
And the position of its builders —the
sixth largest producer of cars in the
world —assures the standard of quality
you may expect, as well as the acknowl-
edged policy of satisfaction to owners,
that stand back of the Hudson Super-Six.

pounds on disinfectants, to no purpose, I rid my
place of fleas by buying a few shjllingsworth of mint
—ordinary garden mint. I simply threw the leaves
all over the shop, as I was told to, and the result
was magical. I still spread a few leaves under
carpets and linos, and have never felt a bite since.

“Redraw”: Tell “Ornith” that the male
and female emu divide the duty of looking after the
young birds up to a certain stage. The cock bird
then retires to the flock, and the hen stops until
the young birds are quite able to look after them-
selves. On the big saltbush plains I have often
ridden close to a clutch when both birds were with
them. I have always found the cock bird make a
demonstration while the hen got the young ones
away. They also divide the hatching between them,
the birds taking turns at the job while the other
does sentry-go some distance away. As the emu
does not sit on her eggs, but lies stretched out full
length on top of them, a nest takes some finding. I
once rode right over one; the bird got up under
my horse, and I had a first-class bolt for a mile or so.

“Jcobb”: Some heavy scores were regis-
tered at the N.T. buffalo-camps during the late
season. Harry Hardy, who has been working the
Margaret country for several years, shot, skinned,
salted and carted some 1400 hides in a little better
than three months. His assistants were five abos.,
three of them inexperienced, and Mrs. Hardy, who

follower of Bacchus.”
MRS. McGINNIS : “Faith, an’ he caught an’ passed him years ago.”
saw to the commissariat; and the average carting
distance was 25 miles to the rail siding at Burrun-
die, with three unloadings and reloadings at river
crossings. The hides averaged 4ld. per lb. at
Darwin. Although 6000-odd hides have been shipped
away within a year the herds are increasing. It is
estimated that there are 40,000 buffalo in one little
mob on the Adelaide River; they have not been
shot at for a couple of years.
“Tarago” : For a low-down trickster com-
mend me to Brer Fox. I was walking along a bush
track with the gun, when about 40 yards ahead l
saw one of the ilk leisurely loping away along the
pad. I fired just as he rose to take a log on his
course, anl had the satisfaction of seeing him topple
over the other side. On arriving at the spot I found
poor ltenard stretched out, without a sign of life,

“Can ye idintify the wan that assaulted and robbed ye?”
“Yes, sir. It is the gentleman in the middle.”
and stooped to pick him up by the tail. Like a
flash his head came up, and his jaws snapped like
a steel trap within an inch of my hand; then the
corpse resurrected itself and resumed its canter. Of
course the shot may have stunned him, but you can’t
get me to believe it. That brute thought I had a
double-barrelled gun. I wished I had.
“Gouger”: A few among the Queensland
tribes have tne habit of skinning a deceased warrior
and carrying the hide
around for months.
The operation com-
mences with a slit
from the top of the
head to the back of
the neck; then others
are made down the
body and along the
legs to the heels, in
the hands of experts
the human pelt will
thus peel off in one
piece. The whole tribe
watches the operation
solemnly, while the
skin-removers do their
job in silence. Hair,
ears, nose, toes and
fingers are all left on
the skin, which is
spread out on a couple
of spears before a slow
fire to smoke. A par-
ticularly “oily” skin
takes days of careful
curing before it is per-
fectly dry. It is then
folded up and carried
in a dilly-bag (a bag
similar to white sister’s
powder-puff receptacle),
and carried by a lady
relative. In about six
months’ time the skin
is left on safe-deposit
within a “sacred tree”
—a big hollow tree
containing a pile of
sticks, with the dilly-
bags placed upon them.
A skin-carrier may
give a small piece of
the hide to a very
vaiued friend. On rare
occasions when a white
man has been presented
with such a souvenir,
he has immediately
been “all in” with the
tribe—they’ll do any-
thing for him, even
(occasionally) work.

“Harvib”: “Here, you,” gasped our boss,
counting out at Ulumbie shearing, “cuttin’ and
roughin’ ’em is no crimson good here.” Then, as one
sheep appeared that was too sore to move, he added:
“Look at that ewe—d’you think she’ll live?” For
some moments Dave intently studied the jumbuck in
his pen. “Yairs, boss,” he drawled; “with care and
attention she ought to pull through.”
“Ex-Englishman”: I don’t think there ijs
much doubt that “Curlew” (B. 12/2/’25) is right
in claiming that the title of “ringer,” as a tribute
to success in the shearing-shed or elsewhere, comes
originally from the use of the word in shooting-
galleries. The comic man in an English book,
whether of the Cockney type in Pett Ridge or the
fantastic type in Wodehouse, is always liable Sto
admit the correctness of a remark with the admission
“You certainly rang the bell that time. Will you
have a cigar or a cocoanut?” Yet I remember that
when this same question was discussed in The
Bulletin somewhere about 25 years ago, the most
approved idea seemed to be that the word of praise
was borrowed from the game of (iron) quoits, where
a “ringer” is the best shot possible. The same
inquiry brought out the companion word “drummer”
for the worst shearer in the shed. Is this still in
use, too ?
* * * *
“Marko”: Recent Bulletin pars show
that there is something unexplained about the mos-
quito. Like “Sax” (B. 5/'2/’26), I have tried the
dodge of letting the brute bite till he had had
enough, and the result in my case was no good at
all. Others, however, in the same house get their
full night’s sleep without the aid of a net or citron-
ella or anything else. Evidently there is a differ-
ence between the blood or the sensory nerves of one
individual and another. Scientists might pursue the
matter further; it is conceivable that absence of after-
irritation might also mean immunity to malaria.
* * * *
“North-West”: “Centre” is quite right
when he says the kangaroo thuds with its legs (B.
12/2/’25). My mate and I were arguing on the
subject when an obliging ’roo gave us an ocular
demonstration, which compelled my mate to concede
the point.
“Nitric”: “Centre” loses his bet. I’ve seen,
shot and heard thousands of ’roos, and have a tame
whiptail at home now. I’ve just been studying his
method of locomotion. The spring seems to come
more from the feet and lower part of the legs than
the thighs; he takes off and lands on his feet. It
is generally thought he lands on the whole fore-part
of his leg, which is always rough and hairless. But
the latter result is from his squatting on this part.
What is more, as he springs the tail stiffens and
gives him a forward projection, which aids flight
greatly. If you examine the base of a ’roo’s tail
you’ll find well-developed bunched muscles which do
not result from wagging the thing. Finally, the tail
has the skin well worn underneath, and that is
occasioned by what I’ve just watched —the thump-
ing of the appendage.
“Gouger”: “Centre” wins; ’roos signal with their
feet. This way. The ’roo jumps straight in the
air, coming down very sharply on both feet. The
tail also strikes the ground, but only naturally.
Some species of wallabies balance on one foot and
tail and give two distinct knocks. It could hardly be
called balancing on the tail, as the whole movement
is very quick. The rock-wallabv has a long, flex-
ible tail, which won’t hold weight. It is purely a
balance for the body when hopping. It gives two
sharp knocks with the feet. Rabbits also signal
an alarm by thumping with the feet —a buck in the
air and two quick thumps, one with each foot.
“J.D.C.”: “Centre” may rest assured that the
tail never touches the ground except when the ’roo
is sitting up or crawling. I have often heard the
thumps referred to —-alarm signals—but never, by
watching the ’roo in motion or by subsequent track-
ing, have I found the slightest indication that the
sound was made by the tail striking the ground.
The ’roo is always on the move when the signal is
made, and if the tracks are examined it will be seen
that the feet were further apart than usual, one
being much in front of the other. Also, in place of the
animals travelling on the feet proper, nearly the whole
length, from hock to toe, has been striking the
ground at intervals. The sound is made in exactly
the same way as the rabbit does it, with the one
difference that Bunny gives “the office” before stort-
ing, while the ’roo is on the move when he thumps.
And the faster he travels the lower he carries his
head, his tail rising higher to correspond. Having
tracked him on mud, sand, dust, wet grass, up hill
and down, fast and slow, I scoff at the idea that his
tail touches the ground while travelling.
“Rox”; Any bushman who has studied the move-
ments of the ’roo knows that it always strikes the
ground a powerful blow with its tail when anxious
to start off suddenly. This is done to propel the
body forward quickly. By bringing the tail down
sharply, and almost simultaneously straightening the
base or thicker portion—which is a mass of sinews—
the body is pushed forward suddenly, thus helping
the animal wonderfully in his spring off the mark.
This can be clearly seen in the slow-motion cine-
matograph. When starting off quietly on bottom
gear he merely touches the ground with his tail;
consequently there is no thud. But give him a
sudden fright and you will hear in no uncertain
manner a succession of thuds; and he is gone.

“Myoldern”: The Darwin gin who tele-
pathically saw her husband being eaten by alligators
in Arnhem’s Land is surely named Sapphira. Her
“husband,” an erratic Alice Springs nigger named
Jimmy Widgetie, was taken from the Fanny Bay
gaol to act as guide to the Huddersfield search
party. He disliked the job, and one night, when
left on watch at the camp, helped himself to pro-
visions and decamped. The first theory was that
cannibal blacks had made a meal of Jimmy. Tlien
it was decided that an alligator had sneaked on the
camp in the darkness and carried the nigger away.
As a matter of fact, Jimmy is somewhere about the
Katherine now, having travelled overland from Cale-
don Bay, and his lubra has gone to the Katherine
to meet him there. Jinny knew that her Jimmy
wasn’t coming back on the Huddersfield; “bush tele-
graphs” (smoke signals) had told her that long
before, and also when and where to find him.
“Akran”: “Nitric” (B. 29/l/’25) and
“The Rumpus” (B. l/l/’25) needn’t go scouring their
native scrubs for weather-prophets when the real
thing can be found around the house. Absolutely
the champion at forecasting a downpour is the com-
mon muscovy duck. Long before there’s a sign of
the taps being turned on these prophets get in a
bunch and cake-walk in a circle. Have never known
them to go wrong, and the harder they jazz the bigger
the deluge.
* * * #
“Veronal”: “F.P.J.’s” wild turkey (B.
19/2/’25) certainly managed to conceal itself in
very sparse cover, but it is a game at which these
birds are adepts. I have seen them squat flat on
the ground on the Monaro (N.S.W.) plains in spots
where nothing but short grass or bare soil was
available, and by so doing they became practically
invisible, except at a short distance. The drab-grev
chicks of the spur-winged plover disappear on com-
paratively bare soil or sand even more wonderfully,
melting into the void almost at one’s feet. Very
young black-fronted dottrels also do the disappear-
ing trick at a peculiar danger-call from their
watchful parents. Close search will usually reveal
them crouched, still as death, against a dark-colored
stone or lump of earth. The night-jar, too, when m
the barren leaf-strewn ranges it loves, will rise, spirit-
like, at your feet and flit away on silent wing. It

is aptly named the “ghost bird” in the bush. When
squatting on the single egg the bird on incubator
duty is careful to keep its eye tightly shut, so that
some chance ray of sunlight, striking on the open
eye, may not betray its whereabouts to watchful
enemies.

FACTS ABOUT
MEGGITT’S
LINSEED SHEEP NUTS.
o
s
/
Linseed Cake or Meal is recognised throughout the world as being the best and most wholesome of
foods for sheep because:—
( 1). It is highly palatable. Sheep rush it.
(2) It is extremely rich in digestible protein, which is the main food factor affecting wool growth,
potency in rams, fecundity in ewes and secretion of milk.
(3) It,contains 9 per cent. Oil of a laxative and medicinal character, which is beneficial to the wool, skin
and “handling” of sheep, and is a great promoter of health.
(4) Due to its mucilaginous character it supplies the succulence in food which is so often lacking.
(5) It is rich in the mineral salts which control the vital life processes and are essential for the growth
of wool and for the pregnant ewe.
(6) It is a tonic for and a regulator of the system, quickly restoring animals low in condition.
(7) It is of high value in pasture improvement.
Meggitt Limited’s Pure Linseed Sheep Nuts are pure Linseed Cakes broken into conveniently-sized
pieces or nuts, forming a highly-concentrated food in an easily-handled form.
It Will Pay You to feed Linseed Sheep Nuts Now, while your ewes are in lamb because: —
(1) It is a proved fact that grasses in their ripe state (as at present) contain relatively little protein, the
chief need of the pregnant ewe.
(2) Meggitt’s Linseed Sheep Nuts will supply this want and ensure healthy growth of the unborn lamb
without drain on the constitution of the ewe.
(3) Lambing will be easier and mortality among ewes obviated.
(4) The secretion of Milk in the ewe will be enhanced, thus the lamb will be well nourished from birth
and make greater progress.
(5) Lambs will be stronger constitutionally and better able to stand castration, tailing and the attacks
of disease.
(6) There will be more lambs.
(7) Both the quality and quantity of wool in ewes and lambs will be improved.
(8) Considerable improvement will be affected in your pastures, their carrying capacity being increased
by the high manurial value of the droppings of sheep fed Meggitt’s Linseed Sheep Nuts. The
residual manurial value of one ton of Sheep Nuts, as calculated on to-day s Fertilizer values,
exceeds £6.
Ten tons of Meggitt’s Linseed Sheep Nuts will supplement the pastures of 2500 breeding ewes from
NOW till the beginning of May.
An increase of 10 per cent, in lambs marked, plus the improved quality and quantity of wool grown,
plus the manurial value of the feed consumed, would give a return which could be conservatively
estimated at £6OO for an outlay of less than £125 !

The members’ lawns and stands were
nicely populated for Saturday’s V.R.C.
Autumn finals, but the crowd trickled more
thinly about the old reserves, because the
pay-as-you-comes can now mingle with the
members for an extra ten shillings. They
do it, too, although the public stands offer
a closer view of the winning post. The bright
sunshine was overcooled by a little breeze,
and women, furred heavily enough to
withstand the Arctic cold, flatly contradicted
others who fluttered muslins and voiles that
would have been good wear in Cooktown. A
small section breathed defiance and aired
unshapely legs in kilts, but most were frocked
discreetly to the calves. One lady, trussed
in black satin, shapeless as Mrs. Noah’s,
flaunted a bare neck and arms browned by
the sun to chocolate. Lady Forster, in del-
phinium blue, was tucked away in the vice-
regal pen with Miss Carleton. Airs. Pitt
Rivers was more visible in fawn, with a
brown velvet hat enclosing her golden head
and a fur stole nestling on her shoulders.
Mrs. Alan Currie was the last word in
black-frocked elegance under one of the
jaunty little lids which now thatch feminine
heads from Toorak to Collingwood.
One of the tastiest was Airs. Angus
McPhail, whose feathers nodded over a
hat and frock imported from Paris. Airs.
Byron Moore, with daughter Linda, smiled
above black. Beatrice Henty, just back
from an English trip, was in the stand,
and near by was a Herbert Power daughter.
Airs. Norman Falkiner moved handsomely
in dark hat and coat, and Mrs. Guy Bates
Post, in fawn with a feathered toque and a
mauve wrap slung over one arm, posed mid-
lawn for marauding camera men, with Airs.
Jack Tait and another Tait wife completing
the composition. The W. J. T. Clarke pair,
she in a Queen Alaryish hat with many
plumes, paraded together; and Mrs. Stewart,
whose medical husband has stepped on to the
retired list after dosing Melbourne Gaol
patients for many years, had draped her
grace with an ermine shawl which drove
women to envy. The more spectacular days of
these meetings have passed with the enlarge-
ment of the course. No longer do the crowds
collect to watch the vice-regal party ceremoni-
ously procesh to their tea or lunch feeds, or
gather together to see what Toorak is wear-
ing.
Rain washed the crowds at Flemington on
Australian Cup day, and the women came
with their autumn feathers safeguarded by
waterproofs and brollies. The ne v members'
stand, which roused the controversy during
tiie Cup carnival, left no one outside jealous
of its inmates: those seated in its superior
heights had to back to the rear-end to avoid
a ducking. Neai’ly every feminine head
was felt-hatted. Kath Osborne matched her
brown overcoat with a felt tile, Mrs. Stanley
Bruce’s felted head was grey to go with her
tailorings and neckfur, and Airs. Norman
Falkiner’s red felt thatch topped a bronze-
colored waterproof. A section of the best-
known were hidden away in the special
stand. The Lauclilan Mackinnons sheltered
in the special reserve with the veteran AA ril-
liam Leonard and his wife, the Clive Leonard
pair and other racing headlights. Airs.
Donald Mackinnon’s black cloth
frock seemed to breathe Washington from
every angle.
The N.S.AV. Wanderers and Camperdown’s
A teams qualified for the Stradbroke Cup
polo finals in a burst of vivid sunshine, which
called the crowd in hundreds to the. Aloonee
Valley course. Airs. Pitt Rivers, in navy,
gladdened with Egyptian red and gold and
a red hat, had brought her two small sons
to barrack for the Alother State, which Tony
Hordern, Roy and Bert Bell and Fred White
represented. “Chottie” and Jack Alanifold,
Oliver Winter-Irving and R. Brisbane were
the Camperdown cracks. The contests
finished on Friday, when Camperdown, last
year’s winners, snatched victory from under
the hooves of the N.S.W. ponies by a single
goal. N.S:W. had dash, but Oliver Winter-
Irving’s faultless game gave Camperdown the
palm. The whole meeting was mercifully
free from casualties to horse and man. Roy
Bell invited some fierce tumbles which he
evaded with the expertness of a circus trick-
rider. Lady Forster, attended by Aliss
Carleton, looked on with her two Pitt Rivers
grandsons* and Air. Dubs.
Alister Clark, as Polo Club president,
understudied Lord Stradbroke as Rost at the
afternoon tea, for which the State Governor
had broadcasted cards some days before the
death of his son. Captains Keppell-1 aimer
and Bircham helped him keep an eye on tiie
invited at the swishest tea-drinking we have
had for years.
The Victoria League will profit fatly by its
“guinea” ball, which, owing to Melbourne s
charred Town Hall having no roof, was held
in St. Hilda’s civic ballroom. The decorations
of red, white and blue were chaste but
simple. A bushseape curtained the stage,
and balloons bobbed above the centre lights,
where no one could filch them. In the new
entrance-hall the “bingled” sex flitted here
and there, with cigarettes between car-
mine lips, and skirts whose fringes caressed
the knees. The majority, however, were the
last word in elegance, and quite a lot of the
best-known swept the boards with wispy
trains. The Edward Miller dame moved
imposingly in black velour and lace with
panels. Lady Forster in misty blue and
silver, sat at the parlor end behind a hedge
of presentation flowers, with Chief Justice
Irvine and his wife, Priminister and Mrs.
Bruce—the latter looking like a plump
canary in yellow and gold lace—and Papua’s
Governor, Hubert Murray. Supper was
spread in the annexe, where the Vice-regals
ate cold cliook among decorations of sweet
peas, while the crowd munched among asters.
The younger Leslie Stuart girl, Lavender,
budded in debutante white and crystal, Mrs.
Oliver Lodge was a mermaid in filmy green,
lion. sec. Linda Byron-Moore was frocked in
coral pink, and Mrs. Pat Osborne dimpled in
black.
The Andrew Chirnside pair, who brought
daughter Joan down from their Mountain
Berwick fastness for polo-cam race week, un-
packed the first jazz of the season on Monday
of last week at Charters, Toorak. Twinkling-
lights silhouetted the garden paths and
crawled over the lawns like an invasion of
glow-worms; and a ton-load of vegetation
and baskets dripping with l-oses brightened
the indoor landscape. Despite the wretchedly
small output of dancing-men, the foam of
chiffon was underwaved with plenty of black
coats. Mrs. Chirnside sheathed black lace
with a silvery moonbeam; and dark-haired
Joan was in rose-red crepe, enmeshed with
gold lace. Mrs. Albert Nash, Mrs. Chirn-
side’s sister, wore black satin with yoke and
a front pinny of pewter-colored lace. The
Alan Curries, the Chester Manifolds, Katli
Osborne (Sydney), in a glittering frock of
mulberry tint, Judith Black (Perth) and
a Tom Clarke daughter from the Speck,
and the Harry Whiting and Alan Spowers
pairs were amongst those who mingled.
Mrs. Jimmy Gatehouse, who looms large
in inner golfing circles, and was once Vic-
torian lady champ., beckoned a couple of
dozen of her sister enthusiasts the
Quamby Club to farewell Mrs. Ernest Keep.
The teacups rattled in the glow of pink
dahlias. Amongst the tea-drinkers was Mrs.
V. B. Trapp, another feminine ex-champ.,
who has again unpacked her clubs at the
Sandringham links after several months of
foreign travel. Our present star, Mrs. New-
ton-T.ees, a sister of the hostess, sb.ed lustre
on the proceedings.
A well-known Melbourne songbird, Madame
Minnie Waugh, is pictured here by
Broothorn. Minnie set out at seven to be a
pianist, but at
15 Thomas
Lamble in-
duced her to
close the piano-
lid and take
to song.
Checci. one of
Melba’s train-
ers, then took
on the good
work, which
was continued
by the visiting
tenor, Parkin-
son, who, hav-
ing dipped into
Aussie sun-
shine in search
of health, un-
dertook to
train 12 speci-
ally - selected
pupils. In Lon-
don her dra-
matic soprano was starting to be heard in
the higher places when urgent business
brought her back to this city. During the
war and since her voice has always been ready
for duty on charitable platforms.
Peter Rous, the Stradbrokes’ youngest sur-
viving son, farewelled his schoolmates at
Grimwade House the other day before steam-
ing back to England aboard the Ulysses, to
follow his eldest brother, Lord Dunwich, into
the Navy. Unless Dame Rumor is mislead-
ing us, his mother is also returning to her
home land shortly.
Another Ulysses passenger is the only
daughter of French Consul Turck. Ninette
is to undergo a year’s scholastic polishing in
Paris.
The Archie Curries —the shipping, not
the squatting clan —launched daughter Kath
as a grown-up on Thursday night in the
Prahran Civic Hall. The guests passed under
a flowery triumphal arch to the jazz arena,
where evergreens and golden laurel leaves
festooned the walls. Mrs. Curries brown
beaded effects were hemmed with fur, and
daughter Kath budded like a pink wa terlily
in satin and tulle. T wo other buds that
blossomed that night were the Harold New-
bigins’ daughter Joan, in pink sparkling with
crystal, and dark-eyed Alison Pigott, a grand-
daughter of the famous Scots College head,
the late Dr. Morrison. The supper table
wore red posies flying from upstanding masts.
Big James Borrowman had looked in to see
the fun with daughter Elsie. The elder
Currie daughter, Mrs. Ken Syme, was an
autumn sunset in pink and gold, and three
sisters of the host, Mrs. Caddy, Mrs. S.
Fraser and Alice Currie, and little Betty
Caddy contributed to the chiffon thrills. Mrs.
Tony Hordern and Mrs. Hunter Patterson
wore black, while Mrs. Lauchie Mackinnon
patched the roomscape vividly with cerise
and gold. * . T .
This Vandyck photo introduces you to Dr.
W. G. Price, Melbourne’s city organist,
whose instrument went up in smoke with the
Town Hall concert-room. The veteran musi-
cian comes of a long line of organists, and
got his earliest
training from
his father be-
fore a final
polishing was
a d ministered
by Dr. Chipp,
organist at
Ely Cathedral.
It was in that
imposing edi-
fice Dr. Price
started on his
career. Later
he crossed to
Belfast to
supply the
harmony at
St. George’s
Church, an d
while in that
city his reci-
tals in the Bel-
fast Ulster
Hall, which
holds 2000, were made to overflowing houses.
Mrs. George Dowling, of Jellalabad, had
conspired with Mrs. H. M. Cox, of Wombat
Park, to add the fullstop to the polo thrills
on Friday night with jazz at No. !) Darling-
street. Team members and inter-State visi-
tors were principal guests. The event served
as a take-off for daughter Marna Cox, who
made the plunge in silver lace, hemmed and
sashed with gold—a change from the snowy
simplicity with which the pre-war maiden
farewelled her pigtail days. Mrs. Dowling
stood in blue and silver brocade with grey
fur warming the side panels, and Mrs. Cox
was a milky way in silver powdering black.
Floss Cox’s fairness shone out above a short-
skirted frock of hectic red, while Aline
Dowling trotted in silver and green tissue
fringed with ostrich fronds. The floral deco-
rations blushed from pink to rose color.
Amongst the N.S.W. guests were Mrs. Tony
Hordern, whose cherry-colored confection
was inlaid with dull gold.
Members of the Women Citizens’ movement
are determined that St. Hilda’s All Saints
church-wardens shall not bounce them
out of their candidate for Fawkner without
a fight, even though vicar Jones’s wife has
promised the dear old things to withdraw and
so save the church from being mixed in
with politics. As W.C.M. president, Miss
Gilman Jones, who is chief marm at the
Girls’ Grammar and unrelated to the
vicar’s lady, has said: “We as a council
still hope to hear Mrs. Jones say ‘Yes.’ ” The
Women Citizens are non-party, and a dis-
tinctly more wideawake lot than their elder
sisters, the Women’s Leaguers. The latter
ruffle at the bare suggestion of women M’s.P.,
and the dear souls are “Liberal” to their
spinal marrow.
One of the St. Kilda Michaelis brothers
dropped in on sunny Spain the other day and
was amazed to find the languorous inhabi-
tants had awakened to the joys of soccer. The
craze, he says, is threatening the matador
with unemployment and the fighting bulls
with fatty degeneration of the liver. Here
is a notion foi; the R.S.P.C.A.: it might do
more good in some countries by distributing
footballs than by humanitarian appeals.
En route to Sydney from the Copenhagen
, International Council of Women, the con-
gress of the International Federation of
University Women at Christiana, the League
of Nations and other ports, Miss G. H.
Marks, lecturer in French at Sydney Uni.
Women in Australia, she told us in passing,
don’t cut so much political ice as their
Nothern European sisters do. Men are a
mere circumstance up there. Nevertheless,
our tyrants do at least remove their hats in
lifts—sometimes.
Goodness knows what collective woman
will leave behind her when the Last Trump
sounds and she has to slip on something in
a hurry and come down ; but £650 was left
by one of her in a hotel bathroom the other
day.- Another of her left in another hostelry
rings and bangles worth four figures—left
them on a breakfast tray, carelessly covered
by a serviette. Regarding this last, the
hotel manager asserts that the manner in
which she rewarded with half a crown the
honest girl who restored the bullion was mag-
nificent.
The M.C.C. opened its 26tli autumn tennis
frenzy on Friday at the Albert ground on
courts hemmed round with enthusiastic on-
lookers. The school girls’ and boys’ sets
drew all the younger groups. Mrs. O’Hara
Wood was there to see her Pat defeat B. H.
Lyon before entering the fray herself against
E. Wilcox, whom she also routed. Miss
Harper, from Sydney, put the popular Vere
de Bavay down, and Teague and Miss Ahern
defeated Armstrong and a pretty Winter-
Irving girl in the mixed doubles. Gerald
Patterson, whose ankle has been troubling,
gave Ted Yencken a walkover.
One of the “stunts” of Chief Railway
Commissioner Clapp is an attractive poster
telling people how the blackberry-bushes are
loaded with fruit up in the picturesque Dan-
denong ranges beyond Ringwood. Under the
Noxious Weeds Act blackberries are a pest,
and to help suppress all such superfluous
growths 5 per cent, has been added to the
Land Tax. So what Clapp regards as an
attraction, Peverill, superintendent of weeds-
destruction, must officially treat as a menace.
Another case of one man’s weed being another
man’s salad.
London’s Seamen’s Mission secretary Knox
is putting in a six months’ holiday trotting
the globe to see how poor Jack gets on ashore
in other ports. The Fraser dame, who pre-
sides over the Harbor Lights Guild in Mel-
bourne, carried them off with other guests
to drink bohca by the Frankston waves. The
visitors were enraptured by the beauty of
the coastline, so reminiscent of the Riviera.
Amongst the guests were the Rev. Gurney
Goldsmith, ex-head of the Melbourne Mission,
and his wife, who had come from Maoriland
for the annual Mission Congress. In the
evening the Knoxes were star guests at the
Institute, where the Rev. and Mrs. J. R.
Weller said the how-d’ye-dos, and verbal
posies were thrown to them by Fred Knight
and others.
The trustees have organised a series of
three lectures on the pictures in the National
Gallery, imitating a useful practice prevail-
ing in the British Gallery. The trustees aim
at getting a subsidy from the Government
to make these lectures a fixture; for these
three an unnamed private citizen has under-
taken to foot the bill. Norman Macgeorge
set the ball rolling, and about 200 people
turned up in the hope of discovering why
some of the pictures secured under the terms
of the Felton Bequest had been bought.
Macgeorge, who is a good lecturer as well
as an artist, dodged trouble by leaving out a
number of these pictures, but even then found
it difficult to be enthusiastic about some of
the others. The innovation is a good one;
under the guiding hand of the artist each
picture develops interests which might be
missed by the eye of the casual visitor; and
the discussion of the methods employed by
the various artists will be instructive to
students.
Sister Adelaide’s note :
His Ex. well and truly laid the foundation stone
of the Memorial kiosk at the Adelaide Hospital, and
Premier Gunn thanked the Moulden dame and her
Hospital Auxiliary workers. The kiosk will stand
as a memorial to the late Mrs. A. M. Simpson and
her sister, Miss Sheridan, and was built with a
donation from the £40,000 they left for charities.
It will be staffed and run by the Hospital Auxiliary
as a waiting and refreshment room for visitors and
patients. The Government has promised the Auxiliary
a 30s. per 20s. subsidy towards a maternity wing
and women’s department at the new hospital.
The Chief Justice Murrays have got away at last—
on the Ormonde. Sir Archibald and Lady Edmond-
stone and Belgian Consul-General Saegart and his
wife lunched at Government House while the ship was
at the Outer Harbor.
Conferencing Methodists are on the warpath after
dancing—“the worst thing,” mark you, “that the
Devil ever spewed out of the mouth of Hell,” and
calculated to give young women a flying start on the
road to ruin. Piquancy was lent to the discussion
by the fact that Prince Alfred College and the
Methodist Ladies’ ditto have been known to encourage
the sin, one by allowing an Old Scholars’ dance
and t’other by arranging classes in the giddy art.
The rumpus fizzled out in a non-committal motion
that the abandoned practice should not be allowed in
any of Methodism’s “connexional halls.” Meanwhile our
various palaises show no symptoms of insolvency.
Alice Mallon, our newest songstress, has been given
a concert at the Town Hall with Mayoress Glover as
patron and Mrs. Coleman Phillipson, Countess Filli-
pini and Mrs. Arthur Rymill to help. Booking and
flower sales were brisk, and the cheque will be a
handy size.
Kadina has been having thrills with synthetic
earth shocks. The effect is vouched for as pure earth-
quake and the cause is suspected to be the caving in
of mines where water is rising in abandoned shafts.
The summer in South Aus.—the southern part at
any rate —has broken all records for coolness. In
the two months after Christmas the thermometer
never touched 100, and passed 90 only three times.
And the February rainfall made a record, too. It
was nine times the average, and twice the previous
highest. *

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
SILK
STOCKINGS
The attendance at the Castles concerts was
disappointing. There was only one really
good house, and that was on the final Satur-
day. Those who did attend were enthusiastic,
for Amy’s singing left nothing to be desired,
nnd of how many top-rank artists can you
say that? One society dame explained.
“Why,” slie exclaimed, “the Castles woman
only charges six shillings! I shall wait for
Galli-Curci —•she charges a guinea!” Yet
there is no 15s. difference between Amy
Castles and any singer at present before the
public. It is to be hoped Elsa Stralia won’t
suffer. She’s an Australian, too, and she s
charging only half a guinea!
Essie Ackland’s farewell concert at the
Town Hall on Saturday was a night out, for
some small Highland lads and lassies. An
nnprogrammed item was the contralto’s
singing of “Hail, Caledonia,” standing the
while beneath an, arch of steel formed by
gallant lassies in kilt and plaid. A pre-
lude was the dancing by some braw bairnies
to the skirl of the pipes. The contralto,
gowned in mauve and silver, gathered in
applause unstinted and a garden of flowers.
Incidentally, Mayor Burrows, of Mosman,
handed the singer a cheque for £248, the
proceeds of Mosman’s Citizens’ Concert, and
Henry Braddon had a word to say for the
South-siders. Lady de Chair, in glistening
black, occupied the reserved area with Mrs.
A. Allen, Mrs. Swinson and some other
Society folk.
Lady de Chair again went a-concerting
on Monday night, when Dagmar Thomson,
at the Conservatorium Hall, showed what
Ysaye, had taught her in two years. Very
charming the player looked in a draped frock
that was a mere suggestion of blue in bro-
cade, bordered with skunk. With _ Henry
Penn at the keyboard, the violinist ex-
hibited facile technique and purest of tone
in. among others, a first performance here
of a Nardini sonata harmonised by Ysaye.
Attendants were kept busy passing up the
bow T pots.
Since arriving in our Harbor the motor
passenger-boat Aorangi, of the. Union’s
Pacific service, has presented graceful lines
and aerials picked out nightly in colored
lights. Sundry extra Chinese lanterns and
flags were added for the large-and-early party
on Friday night. The pretty craft, which is
fitted and furnished upon lines both modern
and mediaeval, evidently was designed by
folk who were pacifists or humorists; who
else would have mixed the Periods so dar-
ingly? Special suites —cabin and bathroom —
are panelled in wood or padded in tapestry
according to the approved lines of Queen
Anne, Sheraton, Jacobean, Louis Seize or
such. The smokeroom the days
when knighthood was in flower, with its light
wood panelling, lcadlights with heraldic de-
vices, and adornments of crossed rapiers,
helmets and shields. There’s a fireplace with
an inglenook, too —and what if it doesn't agree
with the back porch, which leads to the deck?
The pictures, very charming copies of the Old
Masters of Italian, French and other schools,
with an original or two by an R.A. of to-day,
suggest that the Aorangi is a sort of floating
advertisement for some big furnishing or
liome-decoration firm. Present-day even-
ing gowns added yet another contrast on the
night of the reception. Quite informal (with
jazzing, of course), no scrambling for a bit to
eat, and no early-closing restrictions, the co.
ran it on popular lines. Frocks displayed
feather and fur adornments, and much glit-
tering embroidery. Drfne Mary Hughes
draped herself in ivory brocade; deep gold
fringe was the feature of Mrs. Herbert Nel-
son’s gold-tissue gown ; Mrs. Laurence Ennis,
whose husband is directing North Shore
Bridge operations for the Dorman Longs,
folded an ermine wrap to a cornflower-blue
frock; Mrs. James Hughes sparkled in dia-
mente and black georgette, and sister Dorothy
Coffee was charming in similar frocking.
The Coombe dame, from the West, and her
two daughters displayed the latest in over-
sea gowning.
Julia Caroli Fossati, a study in silver and
white tissue, with a swish of coral and blue
georgette, raised a big audience and a gar-
den of flowers, with a bit culled from the
orchard, at her recital at the Adyar Hall last
Thursday. From the front row Monsignor
Cattaneo, the Apostolic Delegate, smiled his
approval of the lyric soprano’s Italian offer-
ings, for which her husband played the accom-
paniments. Pianist Mary Charlton, in pink
baronet satin, and violinist Henri Staell,
who supported the singer, found favor; and
Vern Barnett’s accompaniments helped the
artist to success in English, French and Ger-
man songs.
Old Girls of St. Vincent’s College, Potts
Point, met for their annual romp on Sunday
afternoon. The gathering specially honored
Kate Rooney Kirkham, of the contralto
voice, and Kathleen Butler, “Bridge” Brad-
field’s assistant. Kathleen, who wore fas-
cinating black and white, hails from Mount
Victoria, and came under the guidance of the
Sisters of Charity at Katoomba. The meet-
ing developed into a garden party, with tea
under the trees, and musical accompaniment
by the Firemen’s Band. Later Kate, whose
gowning was grey panne and shot satin, with
white plumed millinery, raised her voice in
songs the Garcia taught her.
Phyllis Walls is the maiden whose bright
eyes the Falk camera has here captured. At
Holy Cross
Convent, Wool-
lahra, she
learned to
play piano,
’cello and
organ, and re-
cently gained
the Woolley
Schol arsliip,
which gives
her three years
at the Royal
College of
Music, London.
She sails in
April. As she
is not blessed
with wealth, a
farewell con-
cert is being
e n g i n eered.
Contralto Kate
Rooney pro-
nounced the
young musician a genius upon testing her
powers as accompanist, and her playing has
an individuality which is bound to catch the
ears of her new preceptors.
Ferry passengers all last week had a good
opportunity of studying the handsome yacht
Ohio, which was built a little over two years
ago in Norfolk, Virginia, and thence steamed
up to Washington to take the owner on
board for “the Oriental cruise.” The yacht
then made for New York, where a party
of ten, including the owner’s son, Robert
Scripps, .and his wife joined her. Ferry
passengers probably noticed_ that the owner
was not like other distinguished visitors to
Port Jackson, for there was no jaunting
about of his private launch making courtesy
or business calls. The launch was invari-
ably tied up to the starboard boat boom.
In this yacht of 500 tons Edward W.
Scripps, multi-millionaire and newspaper
magnate, travels around in a more luxurious
fashion perhaps than any other man living.
But there is so little ostentation in his pere-
grinations that the yacht and its owner are
a bit of a mystery to foreigners and even to
■ his own countrymen. The first cruise covered
nearly 23,000 miles, yet the voyage was
dismissed in a few pages of a souvenir pam-
phlet. The owner did not feel disposed to
visit Australia on that first cruise in 1923,
but was satisfied to touch at Thursday Island
on his way from Batavia. Thence he went
to Papua, Vila, Fiji, Tahiti, the Marquesas
and thence to San Diego (Cal.), where he
has a large farm. The vessel will now make
for San Diego after visiting the South Sea
Islands unvisited before, and will then go
round to New York, where she will lay up
until the owner determines whether he will
embark on a third voyage—this time to
Spain and France, Germany, Norway and
Sweden.
On the present voyage there is no gay
party of ten ; the owner is unaccompanied.
But he has a wireless installation which has
a receiving range of 8000 miles and a trans-
mitting range of 1300 miles. The crew
seated'outside the radio operator's room hears
the concerts. The owner has a loud-speaker
in his apartments —and it is invariably
turned off. Current news from the States
comes through at 3 a.m. It is typed and
put up in quadruplicate at 8 in the morning.
His chief delight is reading, varied by an
occasional game of dominoes. He does not
bother going ashore at the places he visits;
they have very little interest for him as
places: it is the healthy life at sea that
appeals to him. He was not at all pleased
at having to go to a hotel in Sydney for
one day W’hile the vessel was being fumi-
gated. He deliberately missed visiting Adel-
aide. He came on from Fremantle direct
to Melbourne —even the short train journey
from the port to the capital of S.A. repelled
him.
There was a rumor in Sydney that two-
thirds of the crew are Japanese. Actually
there are no Japanese at all on board, but,
fautc de mieux, the Ohio carries no less than
four Chinese cooks. The present skipper,
Captain Heimbrod, who is a German, was
second officer in the Oriental cruise. There
are, besides the captain, three officers; also
three quartermasters (four hours on duty,
steering, and eight hours off), a radio opera-
tor —28 all told. The crew are all natural-
ised Americans. The ship is teetotal save
on three days of the year, Christmas, New
Year and Thanksgiving, when whisky, beer
and wine are served round. Cost? A sum
quite beyond this Letter—say, £70,000 per
annum, or a trifle more.
Rupert Hurst, a subaltern in the R.A.A.,
recently back from a course of instruction in
India, has persuaded an old playmate, Claire
Glasgow, niece and adopted daughter of the
Ralph Robinsons, of Vaucluse, to name a
day for their wedding. The artilleryman is
a "son of Colonel Hurst, formerly of the
R.A.A. Unlike most senior officers, the
Colonel retired with a peaceful mind, having
thoughtfully provided himself with an archi-
tect's training beforehe jumped into uniform.
Two ardent golfers have agreed to a life
partnership. They met at the Wentworth
Falls links a little while ago. The lady is
Alice Linard (handsome Mrs. Barton Lessey
is a sister) ; the bachelor is Mr. Sherring,
of the public service. Beecroft has made a
note of the wedding date —April 15, in St.
James’s.
Lurlie Buchanan, who made her curtsey
to Royalty at one of last year’s drawing-
rooms, has come home to seal a marriage
contract in May with Jim Armitage. Her
brother Jack, who owns the broad acres of
Killarney station, remained behind to con-
tinue his education at Jesus College, Cam-
bridge. The bride-elect’s sister Noelie,
whose home is in Canada, will come across
for the nuptials, and will bring her very
small son to visit grandma, Mrs. W. F.
Buchanan, of Moondani, Moss Vale.
The Mater Miscricordiae Hospital was
under the weather for the opening of its
annual fete. It was dull and rainy, with a
mischievous breeze that scattered mats and
lingerie around the grounds. Lady Mayoress
Cecilia Walsh, in navy gabardine touched
up with green and black millinery, did the
sayings ; and Willoughby’s ex-mayoress, Mrs.
Forsyth, displaying some blue-and-gold bro-
cade upon her black frock, also pleaded the
cause of the institution. The want of space
at the hospital was sufficiently demonstrated
when the fete had to stop out and face the
weather, or close up.
Now that England and Adelaide have
had their say about Norman Lindsay, Tokyo
is being given an opportunity to form an
opinion. In December last Japan’s first
N.L. show was held, the promoter thereof
being a young Japanese business man lately
returned from Sydney, where he had for
years gratified his taste for the nude in art
by buying Lindsay etchings, as well as
work by'Zorn and others. Thousands patron*
ised the show, no objection to any of the
exhibits having been made by the authorities,
and, according to a correspondent, Tokyo
art circles are as thrilled as they were by
the works of Van Gogh.

The good-looking Lydia Lipkovska, who
made something of a hit in these parts with
costume song-recitals, sends news of tri-
umphs in opera at La Scala. Her appear-

performances of “Traviata.” But it has not
been all joy. On returning to Europe Lydia
and her husband had a bad blow in the death
of their small daughter.
A note from a poilu :
Australian theologians, those of Sydney in par-
ticular, have been shovelling abuse on the “Con-
tinental” Sunday; in Sydney the controversy started
over Sunday tennis in the parks. But why don’t
the Australian theologians aim at the Continental
compromise? When the Parisian Sabbath-breaker
packs the family hamper for Versailles he or she
seldom fails to run into a churqh on the way to
tram or train to murmur an Ave Maria and dip
fingers in the holy water.
Painted kid hats are the latest craze from
the U.S.A. Feminine society is cleaning
up its old white leather or suede millinery
and treating it to a coat of any color that
will match its new season’s frocks. Lace
such as is commonly used for ecclesiastical
purposes is another fad of the fashionable,
and gold bullion fringe—also much used in
religious ceremonies—is likewise among the
properties of the unanointed.
Artist Will Ashton, who has for the past
year been studying local color and atmo-
sphere in Europe, with an incidental look
at Egypt, will show his gleanings next Wed-
nesday at the Hordern Gallery, and Minis-
ter for Education Bruntnell will utter the
benediction. Lionel Lindsay lias penned a
foreword to the catalogue. A trio of Ash-
ton pictures exhibited at the Royal Insti-
tute of Oil Painters in London quickly found
new homes.
When Irene Vanbrugh and Dion Bouci-
cault pack for home they will leave behind
memories of many deeds of goodness. The
Children’s Home, Havilah, and the Women’s

by women doctors, with Dr. Lucy. Gullett at
the top), will share 50-50 in a matinee organ-
ised by the charming Vanbrugh at the
Theatre Royal on April 28. Mrs. Swinson
is lion, organiser of the function, which
will be Secretaried by Dr. Lucy Gullett and
Mrs. Clarence Read.
Pianist Myrtle Meggy, at present holiday-

The Harvest Thanksgiving Rail at the
Feminist Club on Monday was hostessed, by
Mrs. Herbert Nelson and Miss Ruby Rich.
Cream cloth with dashes of persimmon and
a small beaded hat adorned Mrs. Nelson, and
her partner in the tea-drinking established
an entente between a gold tissue hat and a

Tradition dies hard, and the just-past Ash
Wednesday was a proof of it. Some years
ago Rome decided to remove the “black fast”
on this day and Good Friday in Australia;
nevertheless the older hands can be no more
induced to touch milk or butter than they
could have been got to join the “soupers” in
in days gone by.
A P.S. from Brisbane: —
Sir Matthew celebrated St. Tavvy’s Day by a supper
party at Government House, and the Bob Ram-
says, Alex Macdonald, Kayser Barnes and Mrs.
Arthur Clark helped him do it. His Ex. also gave
a hand at planting palm-trees in the School of
Arts grounds, Petrie, for the Anzac Avenue, which
will lead from Petrie to Redcliffe and be lined with
trees in memory of Diggers. Sir Matthew also
helped to do honor to the Cymric patron Saint at
dinner at the Cafe Majestic, and made mellifluous
remarks about Lloyd George.
Bachelors bade George Whatmore a fond farewell
at Lennon’s before handing him over to Gloria Arn-
dell-Price. Roses and carnations heard the felicitations
and Cremorne saw the end of the party. On a
later date J. B. Armstrong tied the knot. Pretty
Gloria wore white cr6pe de Chine, with white
crin. hat trimmed in orange blossoms, and carried
stephanotis and water lilies. Ena Whatmore in
pink and Jessie Dixon in lemon ’maided; and
Allan Mansfield best-manned. Grace Whatmore un-
leashed the wedding feast at the National.
Mrs. George Sampson and daughter Naera returned
last week and stayed at Government House. Soldier
Harry Chauvel and A.D.C. Knox said how-d’ye-do in
passing to Sir Matthew, and went on by the Mon-
toro. The Michael Rogers pair are also Vice-regal
guests; and the Greenhaughs from Maoriland, with
Mrs. Edwards, lunched with his Ex. on Thursday.
For Alison Webster, who is soon to be married,
Mrs. Ned Cullen gave a bridge and Mah Jongg
party; and Nora Halford gave one of the same
brand for Hilda Walsh, who is going to marry Dr.
Power. Nancy McGowan also had a shivoo in Hilda
Walsh’s honor, Jean Horstgjann, Nora Halford and
Captain Goodwin being amongst the bidden.
Mamie O’Sullivan, the pretty darlc-eyed daughter of
the Toowoomba M. J. O’Sullivans, is shortly to
marry Dr. Frank Lukin, son of Justice Lukin. The
other day Mrs. Frank Paterson opened the doors of
Ercildoune to the little lady’s friends, and 79 dainty
hankies were added to the already overflowing glory
box. Mrs. T. P. Connolly poured the tea for another
big party, and Mrs. E. J. Godsall officiated at morn-
ing tea and chatter in honor of the bride-to-be.
Several Toowoomba hostesses have brewed tea in
honor of Eileen Connell, the lady who has since said
“I will” to Ken McKinney, only son of the John
McKinneys. A frock of ivory marocain, cut on
straight lines, and a veil of Brussels lace, uphol-
stered the pretty bride, and sister Jessie ’maided in
a sleeveless frock of Mary blue georgette. Mr. and
Mrs. Ken McKinney are ’mooning in Sydney.
The newspaper world is the poorer by the death
from heart disease of Thomas Drinkwater Chataway.
He owned and edited the Mackay paper before
getting into Federal politics as Liberal Senator
for Queensland. Seven years later, following his
political defeat, he turned back to the Inky Way as
correspondent for several leading overseas journals;
and some time back the London Morning Post re-
tained him as special Australian representative. A
sister is the widow of Moberly Bell, manager
of the London Times in the days of its greatest
power.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
McShortodds had a great autumn meeting
at Flemington, and Laveuse (12’s), Mercian King
(7’s) and King Pan (15’s) ended the round well tor
him on Saturday. But King Pan was fortunate in
collecting the Northcote Handicap. Drongo, the
runner-up, had only three horses behind him at the
turn, and was travelling much the faster of the pair
when King Pan struggled past the line, a neck in
front. Drongo gave Amalfi, Tressayr, Sandringham,
Dough Ailbe and other good stickers 10 lengths or
more over the final two furlongs, and passed them
all. At a difference of 51b. Lausanne finished ahead
of Mercian King in the Newmarket, and the Melbourne
colt was reckoned unfavorably handicapped in the
Leonard Stakes, over the same course, when asked to
concede the visitor 131 b., even though he had chased
(,'uintus home in the Bourke Handicap. But the
V.R.C. handicapper knows his business. Mercian
King (7’s) vvas just in front of Lausanne at the
end and Valiant was not far away—his turn is
coming. Father’s Voice, well in front early, turned
it up when pressure was put on. He is no champion.
Although Lily pond had been beatin by Accarak
at w.f.a. on the Thursday, he was almost as good a
favorite as Spearfelt (5 to 4) for the King’s Plate,
two miles. Backwood’s price was 4 to 1. Bronte,
a jumpers’-flatter, led for seven furlongs ; then Back-
wood hit the front and tried to stay there. Lilypond
made a dash at him at the entrance to the straight,
and got the measure of the English horse after a
stiff fight, but when Spearfelt ranged alongside the
Westralian chestnut had nothing left in reserve, and
the colt won comfortably by a length, with Backwood
four lengths away, and the time 3min. 32sec. Per-
haps Lilypond is not quite so good as he was in
November, but Spearfelt’s form was very impressive,
and there will be a ton of Victorian money for him
in his races on the Sydney side. Monrose’s Steeple
(the old grey was at (5 to 4 in a field of seven), was
fatal to his erstwhile Ranhvick opponent Warlock,
who blundered and fractured a shoulder. King Gar-
nival showed a glimpse of his two-year-old form
in the Farewell Handicap, but he just failed to reach
Adrift (5 to 2), to whom he was conceding a pound,
and whose third win it was in four starts.
“Under and Over”; O’Neill and Grant, owners
of Spearfelt, collected £3161 as a result of the
colt’s victories in the St. Leger and the King’s Plate.
The Hawk’s successes in the Essendon Stakes and the
0. M. Lloyd StaKes were worth £2219 to J. M.
Cameron, apart from bets. In the C. M. Lloyd Stakes
the M.L. horse established a new Australian record
by galloping the mile in lmin. 36ijsec. He had the
race won a furlong from home, and Heroic was
unable to make any impression on him, though the
chestnut ran past the other three, to finish two
lengths behind his conqueror and the same distance
ahead of The Night Patrol. The now-familiar excuse
was made that Heroic was “not ready,” but if he was
not ready his party had no business to start him.
The cold truth is that he was not good enough.
There would be no bid of 16,000 guineas, or any-
thing like it, if he were put up for auction again.

Three-year-olds are generally conspicuous
on suburban courses at this time of year. At
Moorefield (N.S.W.) on Saturday they won three out
of seven races for all ages and filled nine minor
positions. And a little more vigor on the part of
the jockey would have enabled Loquat to land the
£6OO Moorefield Gup for A. G. White instead of
being beaten a neck by Purser’s elderly sister Note.
Loquat (Eudorus—Desert) is a sluggish, long-striding
fellow who requires plenty of riding, and though
little Cracknell managed to keep the gelding in a good
position most of the way he wasn’t of much assistance
in the straight. There was no money for Note, who
had been giving W. Kelso a lot of trouble, and her
quotation (merely nominal) was 25 to 1. Golden
Voice (Demosthenes —Golden Shoe), who is reckoned
a Doncaster possibility, made hacks of an indifferent
lot in the first division of the Flying Handicap, but
McShortodds, after laying a little evens, demanded
sto 4 on; and 5 to 4 was the “liberal” offer about
Pteropod in the second division, notwithstanding
that the Pteropus gelding looked short of a gallop.
The favorite was worried out of it by the black
mare Quickshot, who was backed in some quarters
from 20’s and 15’s to B’s, although a lot of book-
makers did not write her name. The Newcastle crowd
had a fair win on Mount Erin (s’s) in the Moore-
field Handicap, the Charlemagne II. —Satrillo bay
having a bit too much stamina for Dialogue anil
Loul Satin at the right end; and Windbag, carrying

can liaidly be dissatisfied with their horse’s weight,
lie is handicapped to give Spearfelt 41b., whereas
there was 111 b. between them in the King’s Plate, and
one or both will be dangerous. Drongo, a plodder
who cam stay all day, is in with Bst. 21b., and this
page will have him on its side. Others who impress
are Polycletan (7st. 121 b., Blb. more than he carried
to victory in the Metrop.), Royal Dighton (7st. 81b.)
and Solidity (7st. lib.). This Lavendo three-year-
old is a lot better than many people bargain for,
and a good handicap should come his way presently
though it may not be the Cup. At present Drongo
takes the eye for Easter Monday’s two-miler, but
both races are very open, and a double-event tote
closing the Saturday before the Doncaster would pay
a prodigious price.

“Till! Deacon” : Add to the list of absurd
nomenclature that racehorses suffer from the latest
Sydney hurdle-winner, Old Grey. To saddle a six-
year-old black gelding with such a burden is asking
lor more trouble than the average superstitious
punter is prepared to shoulder.
HIS CHOICE OF LINEN.
FIRST SECOND : “I think it’s time we tossed in Jerry’s towel.”
SECOND SECOND: “Blime, yes — it’s either ’ees towel or ’ees shroud!”
The Englishmen lost the last Test match
at Sydney by 307 runs. Their batsmen failed even
more dismally in the second innings than in the
first, and on fast, true wickets the Australians were
clearly the stronger side. They had a better fast
bowler, better slow bowlers and a more dependable
lot of batsmen. When the early men failed, as in
the first knock at Melbourne and at Adelaide, the
others came off, whereas two or three Englishmen
always had to do the bulk of the work. Only in
one match —the last —did Hobbs and Sutcliffe go
cheaply, and then there was a ghastly collapse,
showing how much the team had come to rely on
these two men. Again, the Australians missed fewer
chances than the visitors when chances were all-
important, and their captain showed sounder judg-
ment than the English skipper, who did some in-
comprehtndve things at times. In the last
innings of the second Test he put Strudwiclc in
first wicket down ; and at the end Chapman was 4 n. 0.,
having been unable to get a hit—a fine forcing bats-
man wasted. England had the best righthand fast-
medium bowler, the best lefthand bowler and the
best pair of opening batsmen; it was slightly
superior, moreover, in ground fielding. And Strud-
wick proved himself quite as good behind the
stumps as Oldfield, though not so good in front.
Hut the team hadn’t a Gregory or a Grimmett or a
Mailey, and several batsmen with great English repu-
tations failed to come off, so Australia remains the
champion cricket country, nor were its triumphs
undeserved. However, the invaders made an excel-
lent impression on the field and off. Finer teams
have visited the Commonwealth, but never a finer
lot of sports.
“Past Grammar”: Grimmett is the 38th bowler
to take 10 or more wickets in a Test match, since
F. It. Spofforth began it in 1879 with 13 for 110
against Lord Harris’ team in Melbourne. “Spoff”
repeated the feat three times; in 1882 (14 for 90 at
Kennington Oval), and in 1883 and 1885 at Sydney
(11 for 117 and 10 for 144) ; and no other man has
taken 14 wickets in a Test. The last Australian to
equal Grimmett’s performance was C. G. Macartney
who bagged 11 for 85 at Leeds in 1909, while Frank
Woolley skittled 10 Australians for 49 at the Oval
in 1912. Nine Australians are included in the list
besides Grimmett; Spofforth, Noble, Turner, Trumble,
Palmer, G. Giffen, E. Jones, Hordern and Macartney.
The Englishmen number a round dozen: W. Bates,
Richardson (lie exceeded the ten in four matches)’
S. F. Barnes, F. Martin, Lohmann, Briggs, Peel,
Lockw'ood, J. T. Hearne, Rhodes, Blythe and Woolley!
“Shrewsbury”; Maurice Tate will have no reason to
be dissatisfied with his first series of Test matches.
His record of 38 wickets, averaging 23.19, not only
beats Barnes’ long-standing figures for an English
bowler (34), but also Arthur Mailey’s tally of 30
made against Douglas’ team. Six Englishmen and
five Australians have taken over 30 wickets in an
Australian Test series ; the best figures are those of
the slow lefthander Rhodes —15.14 for 31 wickets.
“Trekle”: Although Australia has produced such
great batsmen as Trumper, Hill, Giffen, Armstrong,
Syd. Gregory, Macartney, Bardsley and other prolific
run-collectors, it is curious that two visitors should
have beaten them all in Test-match aggregates. When
the S’Africans came in 1910-11, Aubrey Faulkner
broke all records by making 732 runs in the five
games, his scores being 62, 43; 204, 8; 56, 115; 20,
80 ; 52, 92. This fine achievement made Trumper’s
aggregate of 662 take second place, and Victor
that season was at the top of his form—quite the
best bat in the world. Now Sutcliffe has gone two
runs, better than Faulkner by getting 734 in this
year's Tests. Hobbs is second with 573 runs.
“Haseu”; Certainly the Lion did not have the
best of luck in a couple of the Test matches, but
one does become tired of his anguished roars on
the subject. I should think that Gilligan’s troupe
must deplore as much as anyone the wailing news-
papers and such one-ideaed apologists as Fosbery,
for instance. Fosbery travelled down with us from
Hongkong, and bored everyone by exolaining at
every opportunity just how “jolly rotten” the English-
men s luck had been. The 20-day voyage was all
too short for the purpose. It was evidently beyond
r osbery s power to imagine that Collins and co.
might have had anything to do with the result. To
him it was clearly a case all through of “England
Misfortune,” as one London journal billed it.
After the last Test I met Fosbery ashore. “Well ”
1 asked, “how d’you explain it now? Same wicket
same conditions, no one injured. Can’t blame the
luck this time, eh?” “What?” said Fosbery. “Why
wasn t it just our jolly luck that the selectors picked
unmmett at all?” And he wasn’t joking.
“Hamer”: Salmon’s exploit in making
385 for Sydney C.E.G.S. (B. 5/3/’25) was followed
up with some good bowling; but these schoolboy
cracks rarely do anything great in big cricket later
on. Trumper was an exception; it was when he
was a boy at Crown-street school, Sydney that the
news of an arriving cricket star began to be bruited
abroad. Anderson, then a Crown-street master
took a lot of interest in Truinper’s development; and’
when a tew years ago, as headmaster at Kogarah
J übnc School, he announced that Alan Fairfax was
one who would rival Trumper, his word was given
some weight. As a 14-year-old boy, Fairfax added
century to century; but though he has climbed into
the St. George first-grade team at an unusually
early age, he has done nothing very remarkable since.
The precocious cricketer who does shine in the game
often gives his glitter to a different department
from that in which he showed early promise. Collins
joined the Paddington first-grade team, when only a
boy, as a lefthand slow bowler. His ability to
bat was a subsequent development.
* * # *
“FY7” : A. E. Porritt. the Maoriland
Rhodes scholar, who showed up so brilliantly at the
last Olympiad, has been doing great things in England
this season. At Oxford Uni. sports he wen the 100yds.
m lOsec. flat, the 120 hurdles in 16 3-ssec. and the
220 hurdles (jow) in 27 2-ssec. His American
rivals at the Olympic Games must have formed a
high opinion of him, for the Combined American Uni-
versities athletic meeting in America has been post-
poned for a week to enable Porritt to accompany the
Oxford-Cambridge team to the States. His exams,
will detain him at Oxford till after the time originally
fixed for the team’s sailing from England, hence the
Americans’ sportsmanlike action.
* * * *
The second bout at Sydney Stadium
between Darton, the Belgian welter-weight,
and Harry Collins resulted, like the first,
in a points decision for the champicn. Collins
was a bit too rugged for the foreigner, and his
mggedness stood to him in the last four or five
rounds; previously the Belgian had had a bit the
better of the milling. Collins, English by birth, has
a notion of meeting the British champion, whoever
lie may be (Kid Lewis, perhaps), at the National
Sporting Club, and then crossing the herring pond
to tackle representative Yankees. He will find the
English easier than Micky Walker or Benny Leonard.
* * * *
The showing of Sam Burmeister, alleged
to be champion wrestler of the Philippines, at Mel-
bourne Stadium has added to the scorn felt for these
vague foreign titles. Limutkin, the Finn, is little
more than a mountain of moving brawn, as someone
once, wrote; but all the skill shown in the Finland-
Philippines match was Limutkin’s. The two falls to
which Peter subjected his opponent were pitifully
easy. They became a laughing-matter when Bur-
meister’s boast was recalled that he could throw
Thye and Limutkin out of the same ring.
* * * *
“H. Hardupp”: It is profitable to be a
League footballer in Melbourne. Collingwood pays
its leather-chasers a flat rate of £2 10s. per game—
it was £2 the season before last; but as eight clubs
whacked up £12,408 among their men last year,
and an additional £7OOO went in lost time, sick pay
and trips, the season must have been worth anything
between £BO and £l2O to individual players. The
officials don’t get on nearly so well. Whilst the
best-paid secretary draws £264 one only receives
£52 : and auditors’ fees run down as low as £2 2s.
Cn? club doesn’t show any sue h charges. It either
regards the men expected' to check its accounts as
honavaries or treats their payment as a potty-cash
item.
“Louden” : Norm Mclntosh is returning to
Westralia, his old State, after 12 seasons in the
yellow-and-black guernsey of Richmond. The dashing
centre man made Digger Thomas, Jarrahland’s crack
midfielder, look like a novice in that memorable car-
nival game at Hobart last year. If he can show
a glimpse of that form in the West he is almost
certain to be chosen for the central position in the
team to cross the Nullarbor for the match against
Vic. at Melbourne in August.
“Centurion’’: “O.M.’s” repetition (B.
19/2/’25) of the pet League gag as to the Northern
Union game having killed Rugby proper in the
North of England, gives one to smile. No doubt
the wish is father to the thought, but figures are
against “O.M.’s ” imaginings. The whole of the North-
ern 1 nion is, and has been since its inception.
30-odd years ago. confined to certain industrial
districts in Lancashire and Yorkshire. Even there,
Rugby proper ano Soccer have their following, the
latter being far more popular in the Northern
Union’s own special centres than the handling
game. The Northern Union is comprised of less
than 30 proprietary clubs—a fixture list in my posses-
sion gives 23 names in Lancashire and Yorkshire.
The Yorkshire R.U. alcne boasts 51 clubs of “first
grade” standard and in Lancashire the amateur
game is quite as popular as ever it was. North and
South of the little League strip in Yorkshire and
Lancashire, the Northern Llnion or League game is
unknown from the Channel to the Orkneys, while
Rugby and Soccer flourish. The English county
competition alcne fields more county teams, in-
cluding Lancashire and Yorkshire, than the Northern
Union can muster clubs.
“Nitric”: “Centurion” exaggerates in his
smug par. about the exodus of “allegedly crack’’
League fotballers from N.S.W. to Bananaland, and
from one Q. football centre to another (B. 19/2/’25).
Certainly the Queensland Rugby League is more
financial this year than it has ever been, but it is
setting itself against the rank type of professional
sport which has crept in from N. S. Wales. And
five of the seven senior teams in the Brisbane League
have denounced the entrance of the professional ele-
ment. Two of the five are Uni. and Past Grammar.
Certainly Ipswich has attempted to collect one or two
players (Cecil Aynsley, the brilliant winger from Bris-
bane, was offered £5 a week), but Toowoomba has so
many internationals—witness Duncan Thompson and
Tommy Gorman —that it doesn’t need to import in-
ferior players from Sydney. Anyhow, why shouldn’t
football have coaches as well as cricket or golf? The
imported footballer is generally hired for coaching
purposes.

“T.V.T.”: Tell “Shrewsbury” that the
travelling arrangements for the All Blacks (B.
26/2/’25) were in the hands of the English R.U.,
and that the trip to France was made by steamer,
not by aeroplane. For the rest, Simpson, the
referee, who was a member of the official party, states
that, while the hotel accommodation was “fairlj
good ’ the food was “not suited to men playing foot-
ball” ; also that the Maorilanders travelled third-
class on the British railways and first-class in France
(the I rench R.U. saw to that), and that “on some
occasions in England members of the team had to
sit in the dining-car, no carriage having been pro-
vided for them. ’ Contrast this with the treatment
accorded the Chinese Soccer team in Australia and
M.L. Perhaps if the English R.U. had been enter-
taining Asiatics, instead of men of its own race,
there would have been no cause for anyone to growl.
HIS PROBLEM.

He had knit those tangled lines and taut in his

If Lang would come in Fuller’s stead?

flies, moths, sifrerfish, etc.
Follow the simple directions with each bottle, and within five

THE INKY WAY.
Tlie Westralian writer Mollie Skinner, who col-
laborated with D. H. Lawrence in “The Boy in the
Bush,” is back from England, where she arranged
for the publication of another book—her very own
this time. It will be called “The Black Swan” and
will deal with the early days of Westralia.
“Boronia” : Among the harmful effects of children’s
comic papers (B. 5/2/’25) include the villainous
spelling. When children, in their zeal for reading
of the adventures of their favorite characters, have
bad models constantly before them, their task of
acquiring correit word-forms is made appreciably
more difficult. Teachers agree that the most avid
readers of comics are the worst spellers.
0. A. Harris, who has been helping the Christ-
church (M.L.) Sun, has been appointed editor of the
N.Z. Times, the old-established Wellington paper
which has shared the ups and downs of the M.L.
Liberal party. If he cheers the Times up as he
did the Sun, Premier Massey’s ewe-lamb, the
Dominion, will have to start pulling up its socks.
Harris is a Melbourne native whose work is known
to Bulletin readers. His verse has got into three
Australasian anthologies.
Journalist Aleck Hume, Hobart’s oldest and most
popular scribe, who died at 75 the other day, was
a skilled exponent of the Gurney system of short-
hand, and always refused to admit the superiority
of Pitman’s; yet his precept and practice bore little
fruit. George Hogarth, Hobart rep. of Launceston’s
Daily Telegraph, who learnt his reportorial pot-
hooks and hangers under Aleck’s guidance, is now
probably the only non-Pitman stenographer actively
operating in Tasmania.
Wellington (M.L.) Evening Post has just had a
jubilee. Of all its editors the best-known was
Gresley Lukin, who had a host of admirers among
pressmen, among them the late “Billy” Lane.
Their association began away back in the Boomerang
days in Queensland. Both men ended in Maoriland.
It is 35 years ago this month since Lane left the
Boomerang and started Queensland Worker, the
parent not only of all the present Workers but of
the New Australia adventure also.
The London Tatler forgot the case in which a
journal called a fictitious character Nebuchadnezzar
Jones and was fallen upon for damages by a man
who really owned the name. In a recently published
story it suffered the author to present a rackety
nobleman seeking “the firm of Cohen and Cohen,
divorce contractors,” for assistance in obtaining a
divorce by collusion. Whereupon, with just indigna-
tion shining on its noses, a highly respectable legal
firm bearing the name of Cohen and Cohen demanded
satisfaction. It cost a bit to soothe the lacerated
feelings.
“H.J.K.”; Put Charles Garvice first among Hie
English novelists whose colossal ignorance of Australia
doesn’t deter them from writing about it. In one
of his most popular works the hero escapes from a
mob of blacks, who flit from tree to tree, armed
with blowpipes. His subsequent arrival at Ihe
Melbourne docks, where he despairingly watches
the departure of “the huge ocean liner,” is full of
vivid thrill. The depicturing of blowpiping blacks
in the treeless Wimmera is a strain on the imagination,
and when the dock-head hero “leans against a bul-
wark,” I suspect he must have mistaken it for a
“bollard.” As for the “huge ocean liner” which
defies harbor regulations, depth of w’ater, and all that
pertains to the navigation of the Yarra Yarra —well,
I suppose, it’s in keeping with the rest of the story.
“Troophorse”: Francis Birtles, the wanderer over
Australia’s wastes, has set out from Melbourne per
motor-car with his dog Dinkum as mate. The pair
will follow the route taken by Burke and Wills up
to the Gulf of Carpentaria ; thence they will branch
off to the north-west into Arnhem’s Land. The
object is to write up and illustrate with photographs
the whole of the country traversed by the Burke and
Wills expedition. On entering Arnhem’s Land, Birtles
intends to explore the north-eastern portion, and is
hopeful of clearing up some of the mystery about the
Douglas Mawson wreck. Still, there is not much
scope for real exploration ; the late David Lindsay
did what there was left of this to do. The MeCaw
and Murphy expedition went right into the heart
of the Arnhem area during 1910 ; and Arthur Love,
who opposed Nelson for the N.T. at last election, lias
been all over it, whilst the seafront of Arnhem’s
Land has been combed by dozens.
The Exporters and Importers’ Journal, _ a
Yankee publication, illustrates some of the activities
of modern labor unions by pictures of the Bank of
the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, with its
massive vaults guarded by a 15-ton steel door with
intricate locking mechanism, and then: —
“One of our pictures depicts the visit to the bank,
escorted by two of the vice-presidents, of Dame
William Morris, wife of the war-time Premier of the
Australasian Commonwealth. Dame Morris, it may be
added, is one of twenty-six British women honored
with the title of ‘grand dame,’ conferred upon her in
recognition of her distinguished services during the
war. Her visit of inspection to the bank was
peculiarly appropriate, her husband, Premier Morris,
being first to advocate the establishment in Australia
of labor union banks.”
The chronicler refrains from adding that the
war-time Premier offered to open an account in one
o? these institutions with a deposit of £25,000.
“C.R.”: Australian writer Sydney Partrige, has
forsaken Adelaide to settle again up her her beloved
North Shore line (Sydney), where she picks Christmas
bush from her front verandah. She and her husband
have started an artistic printery in Pitt-street, where
you can get the best thought of your soul printed in
Hallamshire or any old way you want. She vvas
the first Australian woman to wholly set up, print
and bind her own book, “Life’s Wallaby,” and she
followed that with a book of her poems, “The Lie,’
some of them reprinted from The Bulletin. She
won the first prize offered by a Sydney weekly for
a serial, the first prize for a novel at the Women’s
Industrial Exhibition, and another first for a story
or two at the Ballarat Eisteddfod. Incidentally, she
has a serial running in Steele Rudd’s Magazine
and a novel or two to her credit on the N.S.W.
Bookstalls. Her son has literary leanings and,
though not 17, prints his very own magazine on
his very own press.
“See Bee”; Ex-Senator and former Labor-leader
Trenwith never went out of his way to cultivate the
goodwill of reporters, but was always very decent
when he had something worth while to give. It was
not surprising, therefore, to see a press fellow do
him (as well as himself) a good turn one night at
Richmond Town Hall. The place was packed with
a critical audience which had come to hear Tren-
with when he first stood for the Senate. It was
10.30 when he finished his speech, and Magona, of
the Argus, who had not a line written but had a
heap of notes, wanted to get away. He had, how-
ever, to wait for the questions, and dreaded the
time they would occupy. The chairman opened the
written queries handed up, and passed them on to
Magona, to whom Trenwith had given his seat on
rising to speak. Magona scanned the questions, and,
without Trenwith’s knowledge, dropped all the trouble-
some ones under the table. Magona’s report next day
was a fine piece of work. Trenwith topped the
poll'; poor Magona is under the sod in IV.A.
“S.T.S.”: The report of examiners on the recent
public examinations of the Uni. of Adelaide makes
it appear that the S.A. youngster —like youth all
over Australia, probably—is hovering between three
styles of writing. One is conscious “fine writing,”
taught him at school, and caught from some of the
newspapers. Here he (or she) talks of Dame
Nature, Old King Sol, Mother Night and so on.
He doesn’t go anywhere, but “.proceeds” ; doesn’t do
anything, but “indulges in” it. Examiners think
tidying the yard, represented as “I adjusted the
back-door surroundings,” reaches “the high-water-
mark of elaboration.” Mixed in with this are Ameri-
canisms caught from the movie screen: “It was
important that I should get niv exam,” “Ideal
weather prevailed Saturday”; or “Olivia falls for
the charms of Cesario.” And then there is slovenly
writing which doubtless reflects slow nly speech: “I
seen,” “had of been.” The examiners come to the
gloomy conclusion that “formal grammar is being
neglected. A few years of this neglect, and correct
English will be spoken only by foreigners,”

The whiskered gallants of “Trelawny of

curtseys at the Sydney Cri. to-morrow night.
“The Truth About Blayds” (an A. A. Milne
play) will next be sprung by Irene Van-

plices on a discriminating public.
“Wildflower” still flames and flushes at
Sydney Majesty’s, and the Spanish dancers
fling themselves about with no diminution

“Dir. Battling Butler” is giving Dorothy
Brunton, Charles Heslop and various other
entertaining persons the time of their Thes-
pian lives at Sydney Opera House. It is
what old Pepys would have described as

Reflections at Sydney Theatre Royal:—
Maurice Moseovitch’s confession of how he spoilt
a good play in order to make it a profitable one is an
interesting example of the process by which the worn
of playwrights fin Is the limelight. Evidently if
Moscovitch had not introduced the oleaginous ending
to “The Outsider” and dragged in the painful “funny
business” in the third act, the thing would never
have had a public existence at all. It is quite
certain that Dorothy Brandon, the writer of the
play, when she sits down to her next composition,
will keep these lessons in mind and won’t waste
her time following Parnassian bush-tracks that lead
away from box offices. Hugh Ward, who has been
combing America and Britain for new plays for the
U THE GREEN GODDESS.” AT MEL-
BOURNE KING'S.
Guy Bates Post as the Rajah of Rukh, and
Ashton Jarry as his Archbishop.
Australian stage, put the gospel clearly in a recent
cable. New York and Chicago, he says, are showing
a disposition to accept blasphemous and salacious
plays. He considers the tendency is ephemeral and
that what the great public really likes is sweet and
wholesome productions. A survey of what it is
feeding on at present and what is coming to it
suggests that he is right—to a certain point. The
Great Public’s dyspeptic stomach won’t stand what
it calls blasphemy and salacity any more than
a vegetarian will stand meat. The vegetarian justi-
fies his devotion to nuts and spinach by saying
that eating meat causes suffering to dumb animals ;
the modern playgoer justifies his inability to sit
out a good drama to the consistent if bitter end by
protesting that it might hurt the feelings of sen-
sitive souls. He won’t deny himself some stimulation,
however, and so he demands a lot of near-blasphemy
and near-salacity which stir without deranging his
nerves, and lie on his conscience as gratefully as a
pre-digested breakfast food on the stomach of an
invalid. Even Repertory, which grew out of a
desire for better things, seems as it grows more
successful to be showing the same tendency.
Sydney Tivoli deserves an 0.8. E. for bring-
ing Errol Addison and Gertrude Mitrenga to
Sydney. They are a pair of classical
dancers whose performance, after much
clumsy boardbeating by jazz “artists,” is as
refreshing as a dab of powder to a flapper.
The lady moves about the stage with such
consummate artistry that this Page suggests
she should be retained forever to teach flat-
footed young shufflers what real dancing is.
Errol Addison lends the elflike toe-tripper
good support and does a number of clever
continental dances of his own. Among the
others Four Little Kelly Girls are worth
noting: three-quarters play the violin and
the other 25 per cent, the piano, and if they
carry on as they are going they w 7 ill get.

Sydney Fullers’ bill isn” _as w 7 ell as it
ought to be; the vaudeville side needs a rest
in a convalescent home and unlimited chicken
broth to bring it back to condition. Also.
“Harmony Row,” George. Wallace’s new
revue, a fourth-rate coster turn with splashes
of local color to make it look like home, is
a wearisome affair. Only the ballet, George
Wallace’s clowning and the boxing scene at
the finish save it from being a dreadful
example.

Norma Talmadge has an unenviable role
at Sydney Lyceum, where she sets out to
reform a rascally son of a man w 7 ho has
proof of dirty work done by her dad. If
is all very unconvincing except the nautical
scenes, which produce a feeling of sea-sick-
ness in delicate stomachs. “The Dark Swan.”
which paddles its w 7 ay at the Lyric, has such
an overloaded cast that a visitor brings aw r ay
only a blur. The “Idle Tongues” that prattle
at the Piccadilly are making things uncom-
fortable for Percy Marmont. The Empress
gives a close-up of Jack Holt and Norma
Shearer being washed down a rapid into
an unapproachable ravine where they are
held prisoners and compelled to hunt for
their tucker, much as Adam did. Baseball
enthusiasts can pick up points from “Hit
and Run” at Hoyt’s, where also Jackie
Coogan is “A Boy. in Flanders” —not the Flan-
ders of the Great Stousli, but the tranquil
land which Rubens put on canvas. Seats
for “The Ten Commandments” at the Prince
Edward are being booked weeks ahead, but
the man who catches leprosy from a female
escapee remains a Klot on the film.
A Sydney show of etchings:—
At Swain’s in Sydney there is a collection ot
etchings which, except for half a dozen missing links,
is the whole history of Norman Lindsay’s progress
in this medium. His first attempts were single
figures, heavy in drawing and tentative in inspiration.
In the later work he has learned to marshal his
cohorts of saints, satyrs, dwarfs and robustious
ladies under the etcher’s needle with more facility
even than he had with the pen. “Beethoven” is
an amazing effort in pure line that simply ignores
its copper base ; in “Dream Merchant” he has availed
himself of the tonal possibilities of the plate. There
is no prettiness in this show but much serious beauty
and a physical exuberance that is somewhat unsettling
to the optic nerve. Emerging from the gallery into
the open air one has a momentary impression that
the street is populated with male mummies in
dark sac suits and female effigies in wax, dragged
to and from their sombre and useless avocations
by invisible wires.

However devoted a matron may be to her
spouse, she likes to be thrilled by the idea
that, in spite of advancing years, she may
still be the object of pursuit by other men.
“The Green Goddess,” at Melbourne King’s,
provides her with a heroine who maintains
all the conventional ideals of motherhood
whilst having a spare attachment on the pre-
mises. The fact that men’s lives hang in
the balance over the heart-passions which
rise in the piece is an additional thrill; and
the finish, which (the husband who drinks
having been removed in the third act) makes
plain sailing the union with the lover who
doesn’t (probably because he is not yet mar-
ried). is entirely satisfactory. According to
many women, all husbands who drink should
be killed in the third act, although some of
them would weep their eyes out if it hap-
pened in their own families.
America and England are brought to a better
understanding six times a week (not count-
ing matinees) at Melbourne Royal, where
“So This is London!” seems likely to exude
its atmosphere of mutual cheerfulness till
winter comes.
The frailties of a dreadful aristocracy are
held up to the laughter of crowded houses at
Melbourne Majesty’s, where “Betty” rises
on dancing feet from the kitchen to the draw-
ing room. There is so little seriousness about
the show that nobody cares to inquire
whether the wholesome little kitclienmaid is
going to improve the members of the aris-
tocracy into which she is received, or whether
a share in their follies is one of the prizes
she receives for having been unlike them.

After wandering for 30 years or so in the
wilderness of back-blocks towns, Ward Lyons
is showing Melbourne a little of the neglected
talent amongst Australian mummers—show-
ing it to such purpose that “Gappy Ricks,” in
which he is the pivot of all events in the
name part, threatens to become an insti-
tution at Melbourne Athenaeum.
The slice which Allan Wilkie cuts from
the Shakspearean pie at the New Palace
Theatre on Saturday night next is “Twelfth
Night.” “The Merchant of Venice” (which
Wilkie calls his “East Lynne”), “As You
Like It,” “Much Ado About Nothing,” and
“Julius Caesar” follow 7 . “The “Tw r o Gentle-
men of Verona,” rather a rarity, is the bill
for to-morrow week.
The Galli-Curci concerts commence at the
Auditorium on April 18; and vast crowds are
already said to be waiting on the mat. At
all events, the advance booking has opened,
and a managerial smile backs the statement.
“A night in Honolulu," at
SYDNEY PALACE.
David Kaili and Eddie Kinley in a musical
boast about their native Hawaii.
Long Tack Sam and his Celestial friends
remain the star attraction at Melbourne
Tivoli, although Tom Clare —a Mel. B.
Spurrisli entertainer who was probably better
when he was less grandfatherly—and Chris
Charlton, an illusionist well up to standard,
have been added to the bill. The programme
is good.
This week Stiffy and Mo are showing Mel-
bourne Bijou how broad-comedy merchants
behave themselves at “The Club” —in this
case a golf club. It is still difficult, even at
week-day matinees, to find seats for late-
comers. A notable addition to the other
part of the bill is Wee Willie Lancet, a
rival to Wee Georgie Wood as a purveyor
of mature humor which is lent piquancy by
the apparent immaturity of the performer.
William appears likely to be a popular item
until he grows up.
Baby Peggy is causing raptures and heart-
throbs at Hoyt’s De Luxe, in Melbourne,
“The Family Secret” giving her the oppor-
tunity. The precocious clie-ild discovers her
father —long an adventurous wanderer —-rob-
bing the house where his own wife and daugh-
ter are domiciled; and the picture-maker
succeeds in working a happy ending from
the situation—which is what picture-makers
are for. “The City that Never Sleeps” gives
a hectic view 7 of night life inNooYark. Because
A. S. M. Hutchinson made phenomenal suc-
cess out of two poor books, his “The Clean
Heart” is given an airing at the Majestic.
It is a good picture, too, although the effort
to make the audience laugh at the qu'aint
sayings of the tramp, Puddlebox, cause an
excessive use of the “cut-in.” “Unseen
Hands” supports the star bill. The Capitol
has found occasion to extend the season of
“The Ten Commandments” to March 20. The
success of this picture is unabated.
* * * *
Some March art show-ers in Melbourne:—
Three satisfactory shows have broken the long
holiday of the rooms of the picture sales-
men, that of Arthur Streeton at the Fine Art Gal-
lery being the most outstanding. Streeton uses his
sure craftsmanship for plain commercial purposes very
often ; but fib is exhibition of a score of his pictures
contains earnest work, and every item in the cata-
logue is interesting. In “Wren’s Masterpiece,” a
large canvas, London St. Paul’s stands out with noble
outline, although the gloom of the surroundings has
been accentuated to gain the effect of glowing light
upon some of the roofs. The Felton Trustees have
purchased for the National Gallery, the price being
£350, “The Chinese Screen,” a rich piece of work
in which the grotesquerie of the Chinese modelling
and the richness of the coloring are exquisitely
handled. An excellent sample of the artist’s breadth
of treatment is in another large picture, “The Barron
Gorge and Sugar Plains,” in which you get a view of
extensive country, with the distances finely treated,
looking out between two bold hillsides. “Venus
Sits In The Blue” is that rare thing nowadays, a
nude study, showing a well-drawn but rather cold-
fleshed lady running risks, physical and other, by
lying in an open window while stars go down in the
blue sky. It suggests a soap advertisement, and is
an adventure in color, interesting, although not en-
tirely successful. There are two pictures (borrowed
from their owners) painted in 1889, about the period
when Streeton produced his “Golden Summer.” They
allow of an intriguing comparison; a wonderful
freshness in them compensates for the absence of
the craftsmanship in the later work.
Ralph Warner is a young man who, after devoting
his talents to decorative work, has been induced
to turn to serious art which is not too serious yet.
He has 45 exhibits at the Decoration Galleries,
and, though the majority of them are merely designs,
their charm is pronounced. Warner has daring
imagination, a strongly developed decorative sense,
and a capacity for expression without visible effort;
but there is a crude use of colors which is effective
in decorative work but hardly permissible in more
serious art. In a panel “From Manly” (No. 24)
the effect of movement on a ripple is suggested with
splendid simplicity.
At the New Gallery, Lloyd Rees, of Sydney, is
introducing himself to a Melbourne audience with
20 oils and 20 pen and pencil drawings. The pen
work earns most applause. It shows painstaking
exactitude and delicate craftsmanship. As one who
has served his apprenticeship in black and white, his
use of shadows in the display of light is the feature
of his oils. He bathes his subject in light and the
shadows are the sides of the bath. The result in
many cases takes the eye; but color truth is evidently
regarded as a minor detail, and .the foliage of the
trees is poorly treated. In No. 19, “Garden on the
Hill,” a man who is operating on a round garden
plot seems to be burying a holly-decked Christmas
pudding. There is, however, earnest work and
freshness in practically all the exhibits.
Mary Pickfovd has been crowding the York
in Adelaide with her Dorothy Vernon of
Iladdon Hall as seen by herself and other
Yankee romancers. The “Wine” film at
West’s takes a good look at various forms
of alcohol in an endeavor to extract a moral
finish. Wondergraph has the worn but always
effective theme of man and girl on an island,
the w'eakest thing about it being the catch-
penny title, “Sinners in Heaven.” At the
Pav. is a real prize fight, with Buck Jones
getting most of the punches. Allan Wilkie
has passed on from the Prince of Wales’s,
much regretted, after introducing Adelaide
to the Gentlemen of Verona and reproducing
many old favorites; and Phil Smith has just
come in to brighten the hill of the Majestic.
“Lud”: The younger set of dramatic
authors in Britain have hit upon a new
advertising stunt. Two new pieces announced
as “shortly to be presented” in Londop were
postponed—so the rumor went round —be
cause of difficulties with the censor. One o'
them, “Meddlers,” when staged at the St.
James’s, was found to rely mostly on an
undressing episode for its drawing powers—
it had apparently no other merit. The un-
dressing scene, in which the principal lady
was supposed to disrobe behind a screen and
then hunt for missing articles of underwear,
was sufficiently audacious to set the audience
wondering why the censor had not finished
his job. In another instance a play called
“THE GREEN GODDESS ,” AT MEL-
BOURNE KING’S.
Winnington Barnes as Major Antony Cres-
pin, James Grant as Dr. Basil Treherne.
“The Arab” was said —by the press-agent —
to have been banned by the Lord Chamber-
lain because he objected to the dusky-hued
hero falling in love with a white woman. If
this is true, then Othello’s occupation is
indeed gone.

NOT A BITE!
THE POET : “I often spend the whole day on
the end of a line.”
THE GIRL : “Yes, I’m fond of fishing, too.
But I’m afraid we’d hath go hungry if
we relied on what our lines bring in.”
“Storky,” with thumbs down: —
Despite its advantages in population and geo-
graphical position, Canada isn’t in it with Australia,
or even Maoriland, as a show country. It is an
actor’s grave. Excellent English dramatic, musical,
revue and other enterprises have hit the rocks in
the land of the Canuck—Martin Harvey lost a small
fortune last year—and even the movie people find it
hard to keep going. At Christmas I supplied the
talk on the Frank Hurley film, “Pearls and Savages,”
rechristened “The Lost Tribe” to attract the American
Hebrew—there are 45,000 Russian Jews in Toronto
alone. The publicity was first-class, and the Massey
Hall, Toronto, is the foremost in the Dominion, but
the great G.P. failed to show up. At every per-
formance, however, I was confronted by groups of
Jews who had come to view their long-lost
“cousins” in Papua. In Montreal and Quebec the
Frencli-Canadian element is so strong that all titles
have to be printed in two languages. I have often
wondered why an all-red chain of theatres was never
established by people like Stoll, Malone and the Firm,
Uuc now I know. Canada would prove too weak a
link. Canadians haven’t developed the show habit.
“E.C.”: When the late Robert Brough
first put on “Trelawny of the Wells” in Aus-
tralia some 25 years ago. it was rehearsed
for three months, and the Sydney season
lasted but two weeks. The failure was attri-
buted to the play being “old-fashioned.”
Evidently it was not ancient enough to be
new; perhaps the present revival will fare
better, the piece being now a quarter of a
century more venerable.
“W.F.H.”: Duncan Macdougall is begin-
ning to wish the walls of his small Playbox
Theatre at 11 Rowe-street, Sydney, were
elastic. Lovers of dramatic art crowded into
Rubbo-Dattilo’s old studio last Sunday night
to hear readings of Balzac's “The Magic
Skin” and “The Workhouse Ward” by Lady
Gregory, to such an extent that every avail-
able inch of seating and floor space was occu-
pied. Next Sunday night at 7.30 the ener-
getic little aetor-oroducer is to read Lady
Gregory’s “The Travelling Man,” and that
is to be followed by a lecture on the history
of the Repertory movement.
“Sturt”: Adelaide Tramways Trust has
caused some sensation by announcing that its
band will be disbanded at the end of March.
Goodman, general manager, says “there are so
many counter attractions now that the ex-
penditure on it does not bring sufficient re-
turn. While the picture shows attract such
large crowds, and plenty of good music is
available indoors, people will not risk un-
favorable outdoor weather to patronise the
concerts. I am very sorry to do this after
the band’s 15 years’ existence, as it has been
my particular hobby, but there is no help
for it.” Harold Davies, Professor of Music
at Adelaide University, and head of the Con-
servatorium, at once appealed to the public
to prevent the disbandment: “The band as
it now exists, under the inspiring leadership
of W. H. Foote, is unique... .The practical
suggestion I offer is that it should be made
a Community Band, fully endowed by public
contribution. On its present amateur basis,
it could be maintained at an outlay of less
than £5OOO a year.”
“C. Ockney” : I agree with “Charlik” (B.
o/3/’25) in his estimate of Edward Solomon
as a composer of light opera. If only he
could have collaborated with Gilbert he
would have scored the big success that was
denied him working with inferior (inferior
to Gilbert, that is) librettists. Sydney
Grundy supplied the “book” for “The Vicar
of Bray” : George Dance did ditto for “The
Nautch Girl.” But mostly Solomon was
associated with Henry Pottinger Stephens
(“Pot,” of the Spokting Times), who was
not a top-notcher by any means, and gener-
ally had to rush things to keep the pot boil-
ing. Together Solomon and Stephens were
responsible for “The Red Hussar,” “Poco-
hontas,” “Claude Duval” and “Billie Tay-
lor.” Good work all of it, but not quite good
enough, especially at a time when Gilbert
and Sullivan were booming.
“M.C.T.”: The return of ’cellist Bessie
Griffiths recalls an incident in the career of
the family trio —Beatrice, Muriel and Bessie.
Soon after arriving in London with mother,
they remembered a former Sydney camera-
man, thought his address Avas No. so-and-so,
Park-lane, and hurried along to get their
photos taken. Driving up to the entrance
of a fine mansion in a modest “growler,”
they bundled out with their little dress-
baskets in their hands. Pleased to see that
their one-time Sydney acquaintance had got
on so well, they accosted a superb Jeames
in the hall. He admitted them, and asked
their business. “We’ve come to have our
photos taken,” said the Cornstalks. “This.”
said Jeames, “is the town ’ouse of ’ls
Royal ’lghness the Dook of Cumberland, and
’is Grace is hout of town.” The fact that
Jeames retained his reason at such an in-
vasion was only due' to the fact that the
Duke was a keen amateur photographer,
and often gave sittings to all sorts of inter-
esting and non-ducal persons. The real
camera-man’s address Avas Parkside.
“Adamascus”: A victim of Brisbane’s re-
cent heat wave was racing-man Tommy
Delohery. Tommy was known throughout
Australia years ago as the principal of the
team of dancers and comedians which com-
prised himself, Craydon and Holland. Giv-
ing up the stage he became interested in
Brisbane racing affairs, and has been
prominent in them for the last 20-odd years.
“The Deacon”: The cinema theatre is to
see a version of “Round the Boree Log,” .by
“John O’Brien,” otherwise Father Patrick
Hartigan. Veteran shoAvman Phil Walsh
has written the scenario, and for some time
past has been busy in the Goulburn district
selecting types and working in local color.
The camera-man is to continue his opera-
tions round about Crookwell and Coota-
mundra. Phil’s ambition is to give the
public a real Australian picture, with dinkum
types and scenery of the kind that thrilled
Marie Tempest and D. H. Lawrence, the
novelist; and he is confident that it will be
realised.
“Old-Timer” (U.S.A.) : Add Leon Caron
to the list of baton-wielders who have con-
ducted grand opera from memory. As a
young man Caron was engaged for Lyster’s
first Italian opera co. as leader of the orchestra
and soloist between acts; old Alberto Zel-
man was in the chair. One “Carmen” night
Zelman, tod ill to leave his bed, sent word to
the theatre that Caron should take the stick,
but forgot to send the score. It was Caron’s
first essay as a conductor, but his keen musi-
cal brain proved equal to the emergency.
The most popular member of that early co.
was Yenosta, the contralto, who, when I last
heard of her, was still on deck at Christ-
church (M.L.), a bright old dame of eighty-
odd. ')
“Late Door”: If Guy Bates Post hadn’t
been billed as an American he would pass
for an English actor anywhere. Though a
native of Seattle, his father was English, and
PROFESSIONAL ADMIRATION.
THE PIERRETTE: “Why are you studying me so closely, Jimmy?"
THE PAINTER : “I’m admiring your wonderful technique."
as a youngster Guy came under the influence
of Australia’s old friend Kyrle Bellew. who
presumably helped to educate the Pacific
Slope accent out of the Post voice. G.B.P.
was 18 when he made his first professional
appearance with Bellew and Mrs. Brown
Potter (Gown-Trotter, as Edmund Fisher
used to call her) in “Charlotte Corday.” He
is 49 uow.
“Jamwood”: Australia hadn’t much use
for Arthur Wontner during the years he
spent in these parts—thought him much
inferior to Julius Knight. London, on the
contrary, has for years regarded Wontner
as one of its representative actors, though it
never took to Knight. And what a range of
parts the man has had since he returned to
his native Cockaigne-—Bassanio, Laertes and
Orsino in Shakspeare; Raymond Fleuriot
in “Madame X”; Golaud in “Pelleas and
Melisande”; Ben Hur; Julian Rolfe in “The
Yellow Ticket”; Count Orloff in “Diplo-
macy” ; Captain Hook in “Peter Pan” ; the
Prophet in “Salome”: Baldasarre in “The
Maid of the Mountains,” and a score of
others. Now and then Wontner goes into
management on his own account. At present
he is doing “You and I” at the Little
Theatre, and his is the only name in the
advts.
“Charlik” recalls another tenor:—
William Parkinson (B. 5/3/’25) was at one time
a very popular tenor in England. His voice was of
the true hel canto order, light and very sweet and
flexible; it was admirably suited to the tenor parts
composed by Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, and the young
Verdi. Reasons of health brought him to Australia,
and I was introduced to him at his beautiful flower-
surrounded home in Brighton (Vic.), where he
lived with his sister. We became friendly and
spent, together with a mutual friend, a holiday at
Daylesford. His memories were delightful. The
one that interested me most was his experiences as
understudy to Sims Reeves. Reeves *was the most
consistent disappointer in the business. It was never
certain that he was going to sing until he actually
appeared on the platform. When he arrived in a
city, the place would be placarded “Sims Reeves
Has Arrived: Will Positively Sing To-night.” But
even then you couldn’t be certain. Of course, an
angry public said he was drunk, but that was untrue.
The then Mrs. Reeves had absolute control over her
husband, and would not allow him to sing if he was
at all off color; mainly for that reason Reeves,
when in his prime, was never heard to sing badly.
Poor Parkinson had to go on before what was left
of a distinctly aggrieved audience. They generally
treated him kindly, but one night in Manchester
they assisted him through the song, with particular
emphasis on the higher notes, and then flung garbage
at him. He left the platform a pitiable object,
vowing never to occupy a similar position again,
and Reeves had to engage another whipping boy.
“T. 0.1.” : King’s School, Parramatta, has
been making efforts to breed white swans
for its ornamental lake. Recently a fine
male bird was missed, and was traced to a
Chinese, who had the bird’s body in the pot.
It cost him a tenner at the local police court.
Australia’s first white swans (a pair) were
brought by Christopher Pond in 1856 for
George Coppin, who placed them in the orna-
mental water at Cremorne Gardens, which
he and G. V. Brooke had purchased from
the creditors of James Ellis, one time of
Cremorne, London. That was the Pond
who helped to establish the Spiers and Pond
catering firm, afterwards famous in London,
and who brought the first English eleven to
Australia.
“Bill Bowyang”: I saw a queer outdoor
show in Colombo when I was returning from
the argument with
Abdul. A lean
Indian approached
us with a mongoose,
its knowing little
head peeping out
from the front of
his shirt. Over his
shoulder he carried
a bag containing a
few snakes. He sold
me one of these
snakes for a rupee,
undertaking that
the mongoose would
destroy it for our
edification. When
the reptile was
placed on the
ground the mon-
goose began to
prance from side to
side; his eyes
turned red with the
light of battle and
his teeth chattered
savagely. Then he
swiftly pounced on
the snake, caught
it at the back of
the head, shook the
squirming thing and
battered it, much
as a terrier does a
rat. The Indian
confessed later that
there was good
money to be made
at the game. He
often recaptured the
snakes before they
were killed and “sold” them to unsuspecting
trippers again and again.
“The Oldest” : Apropos small houses. John
Dunn, comedian, the original English “Jim
Crow” and father of Rosa and Marion (Mrs.
Marcus Clarke), was lessee of the theatre at
Hokitika (M.L.) in January, 1868. One
night he staged “The Irish Attorney,” and
the curtain rose to one gentleman in the
stalls and one lady in the d.c. The comedy
was just about to begin when John Dunn
came forward and stated that the money
taken at the doors would be returned. None
had to be returned : both the audience were
deadheads.
“Tivolian”: Occasionally the Sisters of
the dear old London ’alls (B. 5/3/’25), were
“as advertised.” For example, the Sisters
Levy (three bouncing brunettes of command-
ing stature), the Sisters Bilton (a couple
of amateurish postcard beauties), and the
Beautiful Leamars (two fair-haired damsels ,
of a distinctly saucy type), really bore that
relationship. And their ditties —how they
linger in memory! A sample of a Leamar
chorus:—
First Sister: Mind you inform your fa-ther,
Better inform your fa-ther;
Tell him the truth,
Mention the youth ;
Nothing conceal,
Say all you feel!
Second Sister : But won’t he be angry ?
First Sister : Rather !
But better inform your fa-ther.
Both together-. Take it from me,
Best it will be,
To go and inform your Pa!
One of these sisters married an Honorable,
the other’s hubby was a third-rate comic
singer rejoicing in the name of Billy Bint.
The Bilton beauties were able to make the
public listen to this sort of thing:—
Fresh, fresh, fresh as the morning,
Sweeter than new-mown hay:
Fresh, fresh, very best fresh—
And it’s just what we want to-day.
When Belle Bilton married young Lord Clan-
carty her sister retired from the boards, and
that particular class of turn soon died out,
much regretted by the British Beerage.
“Lud”: A pressman once went to inter-
view Beerbohm Tree, and on his way in
passed a rival journalist going out. “You
see,” said Tree, “that gentleman has taken
your bread out of my mouth.”
THE DANCERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Do not mock the dancers dancing, though they
move like pairs of puppets
Strung on strings of syncopation; short-haired
females, sleek-haired males ;
They are childish that they may regain a child’s
forgotten laughter—
And a playboy with a saxophone is laughing as
he wails.
Lightly dressed and brightly painted goes a dainty
child of twenty,
Still unburned and so unfearing with the luring
fires to play:
She would wish to warm her hands before the fire
of loveless passion:—
And a Satan with a saxophone is pointing her the
way.
Will you say this is no music? ’Tis the music, loud
and fevered,
Of all civilised humanity, its sorrows and its
joys;
Sex and youth and careless laughter shine beneath
its rhythmic madness—
And a poet with a saxophone is singing through
the noise.
Here are lovers with their loved ones, gently wooing
as they follow.
Who shall reck of what may happen when the
dying dance is done?
Oh, the music veils their voices, but their eyes are
full of sayings—
And a cupid with a saxophone is pleading for
each one.
And the wanting but unwanted, gauche or ugly or
unlucky,
As they stretch along the edge of life, are stretched
along the wall.
How they strive to make a noble show of all their
little envies !
And a cynic with a saxophone is mocking each and
all.
Will you say that these are idle that go dancing after
pleasure ?
Will you say that these are foolish who have
sought eternal youth?
They are seeking, blindly seeking, for the way of
utter wisdom- —
And an angel with a saxophone is telling them
the truth.

REX PURE FOODS
reign supreme among canned delicacies. They
are recognised in every household in Australia
as the highest standard of quality. The sale is
enormous; the raw materials are superior to
those used in any factory in the world, whilst
nothing is lacking in skill and experience in
their preparation. Equal care and skill have
been devoted to the containers; the tins and
jars are perfectly hygienic—no solder (lead)
or soldering flux, yet hermetically sealed; we
were the first in the world to use these cans
successfully.

M.M.8.: (1) A combination of producers
tor the sale of a commodity, generally involving
a restriction of the output; (2) a fixed amount of
work; (3) the damaging of machinery or output
by malcontents.... Massie S.:'Your points have been
taken ah eadyAllan AV.D.: Idea good; workman-
ship p00r.... Quero: That sort of story has to be
told with more circumstance if you want anyone
to believe it C.0.E.: Interesting stuff in it;
but formless. It could all go into one-fifth the
space W.D.F.: A very fine yarn until the arrival
of Rafferty. Can’t you do something else with
him?....Eric L.: “Limited Edition” is too thin
Berta Z.; Both some distance off. .. .N.H.H.: Im-
possible yarn Desmond: poor stuff....A.J.G.:
You don’t make as much as you might of “Charlie.”
; ...F.5.8. : No use to us W.D.F.: “The Link”
is rather thin... .T.H.T.: No interest... .W.H.J.:
\oui sentences get. tangled and you don’t know how
to handle a conversation. Read more. .. .James P.;
The yarn has hardly a pulse of life in it...'.
L.VV.. Afiaid its not practicable. For instance,
voting on the strength of income-tax receipts and
that only would, you say, “do away with the neces-
sity of keeping rolls. ’ llow are you going to fix
electoral boundaries, then ?.... Prometheus: Also ran.
Scotty: You’ve held a rotten hand, and we wish
you better luck Bungaree Savage: It isn’t exactly
a sonnet, but the bumping dog appeals to us:
The narrow track that winds among the trees
the fresh-burned land, in which the bristlimr
stumps “
Appear like new cut stubble, and the breeze
That stu-s the leaves high up; my dog that bumps
Against me all in joy; cold wind that blows
* ron crack Untain tops ’ the 60und of stockwhip’s
Are all a part of home among the snows.
Alma Den: But if you wanted to take the
longest possible railway ride in Australia you wouldn t
go north from Townsville. From that junction to
Selwyn (west) is 78 miles further than it is to
horsythe (north)... .F.L.N.; No opening for such as
you submit.... Helen S. : This is a poor market for
that kind of thing Ethel D.; Too slight
8.0’C.: Not much wrong with the sonnet except its
lack of fresh ideas. .. .E.L.8.: Misses, but only by
inches.... J.D.C.; You can’t make “west” rhyme with
“breath” and “shores” with “yore” in March....
Celia W. : Too crude in form Janies H.: You are
quite mistaken. Blank verse is the most regular and
law-bound of all. What you have written is a
loose prose screed with a few scattered rhymes
E.R.M.; Not nearly.... Aninas B. : Very unattractive.
William; No, thanks Jessie R.: Too thin and
too much like too many other thin things R.F.L. •
Even the narrative of a tram ride from Manly to
Sydney would scarcely move us A.L.D.: Very
poor Ripponlea: Dainty little idyll:
“Oh Cyril, I think your so refined;
I hate boys who smell of tobacco and beer,
A our your—so—so different, dear •
You smell of Spearmint and Brilliantine.”
“Dearest,” lie gulped in a tone forlorn,
I can offer but stew and an occasional grilled
chop;
„, Still > * f ive you my word I’ll keep off the hops,
1 hough I know I m not fit to cut your corns.
“Now, promise me, dear, on your word of honor,
(i to look at that Jenkins bird.”
T ,' :es : .^ i ,* r dinkum, Cyril, I give you my word.
Provided you cut that cat, Nora O’Connor.”
‘lt’s a promise, Poll; we’ll track square with each
other.
We re part of each other, like ham and eggs
it Some day I’ll make you Mrs. Beggs.”
“Well, then, on Sunday night come home and meet
mother.”
C.E. (Oakleigh): The verse has a wonderful
movement that flirts with metre, but always jilts it.
.... G.W.R.S.; “The smile thou gavest me” when
addressed to a shop girl sounds a bit too modern
and familiar.... Haggis; You’ve put too much saw-
dust into it... .E.M.8.; No use for novelettes....
J.A.K.: You don’t get the mirth out of it... .T.V.T.:
“High Finance” doesn’t strike us Marigold: The
verse is crude and the incident not very credible....
D.C.: Not bad, but the point wants sharpening....
Del; Doesn’t work H.8.H.: Rather a dreary ser-
mon.., .S.C.G.: Doesn’t make a mark on u 5.,..
Plodder: Misses.... Caesar: A long way 0ff....
Sclierzando: None of them up Cadio: Short of
interest E.P.M. ; They all beat out the old themes
in the old way in too easy verse.... Bellerive: The
sea piece has a fine simplicity and a tang of salt:—
Foundered and buffeted
Upon the weltering straight,
Desperately baffled the ketch
Against a watery fate.
Drenched by the froth
Of the storm-lashed sea,
Gamely toiled the captain
And a crew of three.
Seven days she tossed
On her boisterous trip,
When loomed the coast
Of picturesque QueensclifF.
By the tact of the chief,
A seaman and sport,
She rolled through the heads
And was tugged to port.
....Betty G.: Verse of that kind must scan
accurately and have its rhymes in place... .C.A.D. :
Parodies are vicious things; and you didn’t get hold
of something to say... .8.L.D.: Tjbe same old lament
in the same old shape... .C.S.S.: As empty as the
oldest whisky-bottle on the road to Bourke
Gil W.: Too slight... .A.J.M.: Falls rather badly
over its own feet.... J.J.D.: Don’t care for it.
C.E. (Oakleigh): A poor tale based on an unpleasant
suggestion Roger H.: Nobody is likely to know
much more about it from reading your story
Tiny: Not enough general interest K.: Material
there, but you have not made use of it D.G.
(Wooloowin) : A poor yarn told in an unattractive
way Diana: Not the dog for this sausage—.
Harold P.: Tjhe story is a bit thin and the setting
not well worked out... .S.W.G.: You stick to the
ruts and repeat the old mistakes... .8.L.P.: The
coincidence is handled too mechanically. —Melody
W.: Not for us 1.D.: Not enough in it....
C.F.P.: Not up to the mark.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J.S.: A timid little thing F.C.8.: That isn’t
a joke—it’s an insult.... T.W.: An injection of
sparkling hock would do them good. .. .G.C.S.:
Tasteless, vapid, insipid, etcetera... .A.F.: Figures
with large heads haven’t much chance even when they
are well done —badly drawn ones haven’t any.

Stewart Horns, both hand and electric, can be made to sound a soft, pleasing
note, just sufficient to “put the other fellow wise” before you pass him. A
slight press on the button, or the least push of the ratchet knob produces a
sound that warns, without unduly scaring those ahead.
But, when the occasion arises—in times of emergency or as you prepare to
take those “blind” bends —the Stewart just as easily can be made to give out
a clear, arresting blast that instantly gives you right-of-way.

“Jake”: Though sheep-raising in the
coastal districts of Bananaland has scarcely
been considered profitable, the lessee of
Moreton Island, who recently shore 8000
jumbucks, regards his sea-gi"t run as the
sheepman s paradise—no burr, no flies and
no dogs. Gillies, late Minister for Agriculture,
was said to be investigating with a view to
utilising in a similar way other islands. But
there are few as large or as far distant from
the mainland as Moreton.
‘Bill R.”: This is how the representative
of an inland trading firm in the Ma State
last week unloaded his mind to a Sydney
warehouse:—
Thanking you for allow trouser and
vest the making you done last week. We beg to
inform you that the Gabardine coat taken was our
young fellow Sloman, which is a holiday in Sydney,
as we asked him reply, and will be quite right now
will be fix next statement. Your invoice marked
taken by Sloman but same is in Walgett before and
now he in Tamworth jail, same looking like Chinese
but he had a white father and a black mother.—Yours
faithfully, Tuck Sing Loong and Co.

“Hal A.”; “Doctor” (B. 19/2/’25) is
wrong in stating that Nocoleche station was
sold to McCaughey in 1881. It belonged to
the late F. W. Armytage, of Vic., for some
years before and after that; he also owned
Tliargomindah and Norley. About 1886 he
refused £BOO,OOO for his properties. Then
Sent? the big drought, and somewhere about
1892 the banks took possession of the lot.
It was cruel luck for Armytage, for the
good seasons came back the year after the
banks pushed him out. Kidman bought
Thargomindah, and I believe says that that
gave him his first big start.

“F.S.” : The land speculator has lost no time
! —he rarely does. A few months ago adver-
tisements of North Shore (Sydney) land
sales had a pale wraith of a proposed harbor
bridge; now the pictures of it are as solid
and substantial as Bradley’s Head. In fact,
a visitor from Queensland the other day was
surprised to find the bridge wasn’t finished,
and was only just having its first strike.
Buyers, however, might save themselves
some subsequent annoyance by realising that,
though the bridge may put up land values,
the Act takes care that the increment shall
not all belong to the landowners. Every
municipality within the area likely to be at
all affected is already collecting a bridge rate
—and is likely to go on doing so till the end
of time.

“Derwent”: The Hobart consignees of a
big German sailing ship’s cargo of Baltic
pine have just had to pay a dozen union
wharfies 225. a day apiece for looking on
while the ship’s apprentices heaved the
timber ashore. It appears that the captain
is legally bound to provide every one of his
30 German apprentices with practical ex-
perience in. stowing and discharging cargo.
The penalties for non-compliance with the
German law are severe; the captain, there-
■ fore, daren’t let a wharf lumper touch the
cargo. The consignees on their part daren’t
refuse to employ unionists to unload the
ship in the face of the Australian award.
So the only way out of the deadlock was to
employ union lumpers on condition that they
did no lumping.

“Sturt”: The sea-baths at Glenelg (S.A.)
are to be given a new lease of life; and they
deserve it. From half a century back tiil
about 1910 the big shark-proof enclosures
were finely patronised, and shares in the
Baths Co. were regarded as a sound invest-
ment. Then several things hit the co. very
hard: (1) The introduction of mixed bath-
ing, and consequently of costumes and of
family parties on the sands; (2) the com-
plete safety of the beach, with no surf, and
a growing feeling, after 70 years without an
accident,” that the local variety of shark is
harmless, and that an enclosure is unneces-
sary; (3) winter storms made in the sea-
ward fence great breaches that there were
no funds to repair. But now a new co. has
taken up the wreck, and is to have a long
lease, . with all the up-to-date arrangements
for mixed bathing, and in particular for div-
ing—the thing chiefly missed on the open
beach.

“Tmi Baker”: A few days ago the cables
said that Earle Page had set out for Boga-
lusa, Louisiana (U.S.), to inspect “the
largest sawmill in the world.” Doubt-
less he has since seen it, and also
(what should be of special interest
to Australians) the huge steel refuse-burner,
likewise the largest in the world. Though now
out of commission, this mammoth' structure
has been allowed to stand “as a monument
and memorial to waste.” The inscription,
painted in letters more than a foot high
on the side of the monster, tells its own tale:
REFUSE BURNER.
Born Oct. 1, 1908.
Died July 4, 1924.
Every day during my life of 16 years I consumed
560 cords, or a total of 2,688,000 cords.
I cost $75,000.
My fire destroyed $1,344,000 worth of what was
formerly considered waste. The complete utilisation
of the sawmill refuse in the manufacture of paper
has my fire for ever extinguished.
* * * *
“Hambone” : I bet my best boots that the
hopper dredge sighted a month ago by the
Barrabool in the Indian Ocean (B. 19/2/’25)
was an Aussie stray. At the end of April,
1924, a tug was towing to Newcastle a fleet
of dredges, punts and barges, the disused
plant of the Henderson Naval Base at Cock-
burn Sound IWestralia), sold by the Com-
monwealth and purchased by the Ma State.
In Bass Strait the tail-end dredge broke adrift.
It was sighted by the steamer Kekerangu
early in May 26 miles west of Wilson’s
Promontory, moving in a westerly direction.
The trawler Dibbui made, a vain,, search for it
during May. The current here follows the
Australian southern coast, then the west
coast as far as Sharks Bay, where it swings
in a curve to Madagascar. Then it splits,
one portion forming the Agathas current
along the African coast apd the other tak-
ing a south-easterly and afterwards an
easterly direction. , If tfie dredge followed
the latter current, it'would'cut right through
the path of vessels trading between the Cape
and Fremantle.

Dr. H. S. Newland, who did notable sur-
gical work in England during the war, is
the new president of the Royal Society of
St. George at Adelaide. Fred Johns, author
of “Who's Who in Australia,” continues as
hon. sec.
“Pip Tok”: Black sister is coming on.
M. Fitzpatrick, of the Gascoyne and the
Murchison, one of W.A.’s best-known squat-
ters and motorists, has taught four of the
gins on one of his stations to drive. Each
can do minor repairs also.
“Sidweelan” : “X.N.0.” is three points off
his course when he gives the number of ropes
on a full-rigged ship as five (B. 19/2/’25).
There are eight—man rope, buoy, bell,
bucket, back, bolt, ridge and foot. I don’t
know why “Old Apprentice” (B. 26/2/’25).
omits the bolt rope from his list.
“Adelaide”: A frontage of 52ft. on the
north side of Rundle-street has been sold
for £70,000. The £1331 per foot is a record
for Adelaide; the previous best was £1250
for the York Theatre frontage, and that had
greater depth. Here as everywhere it is
the comparatively narrow street that com-
mands the big business and the big prices.
“Beanacre”: A recent drop in the price of
livestock at the Adelaide abattoirs caused a
hurried sub-editor to place the head-line
“Cheaper Mutton” over the paragraph con-
taining the good news. Next day an irate
representative of the moat interests ex-
plained that the heading should have been
“Cheaper Sheep”—an altogether different
thing, obviously.
Two retiring members of N.S.W. Assem-
bly are not worrying about this year’s elec-
tions. They are the two Walters —Bennett
and O’Hearn—of Maitland. At opposite
political poles, each has a stranglehold on
the electorate by reason of personal popu-
larity, cultivated by strict attention to busi-
ness. William Cameron, the third sitting
member (Maitland returns three), is shaky.
Though dependable enough he doesn’t “mix”
well, and his personal following is small.
“G.H.”: Quite the shortest, and what
appears to be at first glance one of the
most pathetic tombstone inscriptions in exis-
tence may be found in the Melbourne ceme-
tery :
Ah Why.
Dec. 1895.
But, lest it. be taken for a lament from a
bursting heart over the insoluble problem of
existence, I hasten to add that it is in
the Chinese quarter of the burial-ground.
“Sturt”: Hamilton and Wilcox, South
Aus. pastoralists, have offered 1500 acres on
their Coonamore station, south-west from
Broken Hill, as an observation area for
natural vegetation in dry regions. The soil
is of varying kinds, and the growth includes
many things besides saltbush. The owners
are having the whole area rabbit-proof
fenced, and it is then hoped to get it quite
clear of rabbits, so that Professor Osborn,
who is making research into such matters,
may observe the behavior of a bit of real
bush when it gets a chance.
Russia and the Irish Free State now re-
present the extremes of divorce legislation.
In the former Ivan Sovictoff and his wife
Elizabethsky can simply put it on record
that they are tired of each other and go to
marry elsewhere, and if Ivan is very tired
lie may easily find ways to make Elizabeth-
sky exhausted also. In the Irish Free State
Patrick and Bridget are fixed for life unless
they acquire a domicile in some foreign terri-
tory and get parted under its laws. Both
systems are alleged to be based on the sacred
principles of Liberty, an accommodating
female who is most things to many men.
“F.LjH.”: When the pre-war German
Governor of New Guinea had the pleasure
yacht Komet built for him, he could hardly
have dreamed where she would finish up.
On the outbreak of the Great War the
boat was hidden in a creek and camouflaged
with trees. Found, seized, and attached to
the Commonwealth navy, she did patrol-
duty among the South Sea Islands under
her new name of the Una. Since the visit
of the Prince of Wales she has been laid
up, mostly in Sydney Harbor. Now she
is to resume sea life in the Port Phillip
pilot service, superseding the Alvina, who
has earned her pension.
“Jesmond”: The statement of Vic. M.L.C.
Edgar that he had returned his copy of
the Telephone Directory to the P.M.G., be-
cause it had a liquor advt. on the cover,
reminds me that in Melbourne some years
ago a lady refused to take a tram ticket
because it proclaimed the merits of a well-
known brand of whisky. The argument
waxed hot and was concluded by the passen-
ger’s emphatic refusal to be a “travelling
advertisement for intoxicants.” She de-
manded to be put down at the tramway
office. Evidently her uncompromising atti-
tude carried weight, for the tickets were
withdrawn within a few days.
“M.D.”: The scientific expedition which
came to Australia in 1923 claims to have
put its finger on the cause of “brown heart
which affected shipments of Australian, and
especially Tasmanian, apples the preceding
year . Whole cargoes of delicate Jonathans
and sturdy Granny Smiths were either dam-
aged beyond redemption or seriously affected
by the cardiac malady. Many causes were
assigned, but the real one is simple enough.
Apples pine for light and fresh air in the
same way as plants, and they were cut off
from these life-giving indispensables by being
shut up in stifling holds. To put it briefly,
they were suffocated, and, of course, when
the treatment was changed the trouble
ceased.
“Bret Vane” ; Quite the most devastating
liquor I encountered during the war was the
Oriental arrack or araq. Its base is dates,
to which is added orange-peel, mastic, ginger
and the seductive aniseed: its effect on
humanity is not only astounding but curi-
ously protracted. lii fact. I have heard it
said in Bagdad that to drink plain water
on the morning after is to enjoy the trans-
ports over again. Twelve of us inhabited
an E.P. tent: two of us had fallen to araq.
Late at night a hurricane-lantern was burn-
in" over my head. Someone requested that
it "be put out. It wasn’t. One of the two
(they had been indulging freely in the local
stimulant) declared from the other end of
the tent that he'd put the light out.
Jambing a .303 into his rifle he made good
ins undertaking. His name was Kelly.

It Pays to Invest in
Pioneer Leather Belting
An investment in Pioneer Leather Belting pays for itself many
times over. Provided the correct Pioneer Leather Belt has
been selected for each particular drive, and reasonable care
used in its maintenance, you can forget your belting problems
for years to come.
Could there be better evidence of the enduring quality of
Pioneer Leather Belting than the letter reproduced herewith?

Dear Sirs,
We are returning to you one Pioneer Double Leather Belt,
each 15in. and wide, which we have no further use for,
as we have dismantled our Electric Light Plant and connected
up with the Municipal Council Supply.
These were purchased from you about 25 years ago, and
are still in very good condition after all these years of service.
They have proved to be a very good investment to us, for apart
from their long and efficient service, they are returning to us
more than we originally paid for them.
Yours faithfully,

Coffin Key.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
LAY a lanyard to the gun,
Fire a shot, but only one!
As its echoes die away.
On your bended knees and pray
Mercy for the souls set free
Years ago on Coffin Key!
Let the chaplain take his Book,
Plainly writ its warning—look !
“Vengeance is, by flame or sword,
Mine forever,” saitli the Lord.
Close the solemn page and see
Darkness fall on Coffin Key.
On your foreheads, sailors mine.
Let the good priest place the sign;
From the sacred vessel dip
Holy water for the ship;
Throw a little in the sea
As w r e sail past Coffin Key.
Corposants the mastheads light;
Sea fires burn a ghostly white
In the cloven waves that now
Hissing leave our brave ship’s bow.
Trembling on her dark decks, we
Peering pass by Coffin Key.
Steersman, keep her full and by!
’Twas a seabird’s wailing cry
Sounding like the bells that toll
For the passing of a soul,
Sounding, sounding eerily,
In the night on Coffin Key.
Lookout, in the cross-trees cold,
Clench your teeth and keep your hold !
’Twas a dolphin or a shark
Breaching in the haunted dark,
Fearless of what ghosts may be
Still unlaid by Coffin Key.
Murdered men, their hoard to guard
(Ready now to square the yard!)
Murdered men, the buccaneers
Left behind in pirate years,
All unburied here to be
Ghostly guards of Coffin Key.
Now, upon the outward tack,
Lay the ship and look not back
Lest ill-luck her course attend,
Evil reach us in the end,
As they wrought so evilly
Years ago on Coffin Key.
Clean the breech and close the Book!
Never backward, messmates, look!
Leave the pirate and his hoard
To the Justice of the Lord,
And ere morn, please God, we’ll be
Far agone from Coffin Key.
VICTORIA.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
ANDERSON glanced at the clock —ten
J\ minutes to six. Watching the dial
he was conscious that it seemed
rather wobbly, and that something—some-
thing dry and thin and hard—was pounding
away in his mind. Before he could connect
the two irritations the clock slipped up out
of sight and the room swung round and
round in a sort of humming blur. He sat
back in his chair and closed his eyes; it
was no good trying to control the dizzy
spell—better to wait and let it pass.
Control was one of the few things in
which Anderson believed. He controlled the
business of Lockyer and Dwight, for in-
stance ; 58 per cent, of the shares were his,
and this reeling room in which he was sit-
ting was the managing-director’s office. Not
that it suggested the conventional managing-
director’s office; it was too near the stairs,
the employees’ stairs, which ran round the
service lift-well. It was on the first floor;
and there were six floors in the vast building
in which Lockyer and Dwight sold ribbons and
laces, tractors and billiai’d-tables, pins, elec-
tric-light installations, butter, massage—all
the aids to artificial existence.
Harvey Anderson had come here as a
packing-room boy 40 years ago, a hard boy
with only the gods of money and power above
the altar of his boyhood. In the “room” he
packed with remarkable skill and speed, to
the gratified astonishment of even old Mr.
Dwight, who took the boy into his own
office and fed the altar-fire with a specialised
training in universal providing. Harvey
supplemented this with voracious night and
week-end work, eliminating from his con-
sciousness everything but the two gods and
their service. He sold behind the counters,
he walked the floors, he bought, he can-
vassed, he directed advertising; and the rapt
service of the gods bore good fruit. Old Mr.
Dwight died ; and young Mr. Lockyer, whose
gods were quite other gods, was rather at a
loss. In liis dilemma the prompt aid of
Anderson was most useful; so rapidly was
a limited liability company produced from
nowhere with all its officers and prospectus
complete that before he knew where he was
young Mr. Lockyer found himself no longer
at a loss. On the contrary, he found him-
self relieved of confusing duties—-a gentle-
man at large with a 10 per cent, interest in
the business his father had founded. Later,
when he wanted “capital” in rather a hurry,
Anderson came to his aid again and bought
the 10 per cent, (at something below the
quoted price, naturally, by reason of the
hurry) ; and young Mr. Lockyer had no more
dealings with the business his father had
founded. Anderson, on the other hand, be-
came the business.
Twenty years the job took; which doesn’t
seem much to look back on when you are
only 35 at the job’s completion. Arrived at
the place where the gods worked for him
instead of he for them, Anderson had allowed
himself an hour’s retrospect. He sa-w his
father’s selection and the confusion of his
own tumbling childhood ; the baked and hag-
gard land; the three-roomed shanty that was
home. Dimly his mother’s tired face looked
round at him from the stove or the sink, a
couple of children pulling at her skirt; djmly
his father’s voice complained feebly of the
drought or the rain, the fences or the cost
of keeping children. Life was a turmoil of
debt and disappointment; nobody got any-
thing out of it but fruitless labor and con-
fusion ; and nobody hoped to get anything
out of it but these useless things. This was
boyhood ; and this would be youth and man-
hood aud old age. _ Jock Anderson did his
best; but, more Celt than Scot, his best on
an out-back selection was no good. Young
Harvey, a reversion to pure Scot, walked
away in silence, got a job in the distant
township, and lived on nothing for a month.
His train-fare achieved on liis 15th birth-
day, he celebrated the anniversary by tra-
velling to Sydney, answering Lockyer and
Dwight’s advertisement on the day of his
arrival.
Now, at 55, there were another 20 years
of retrospect to add to the first. Not much
in them, perhaps, beyond hard work and a
tightening rein on the harnessed gods. A
dry, thin man with a vulpine face, only his
steady, implacable eyes showed the power
that drove him on, an impersonal power,
narrow and predatory and stupidly ruthless.
Nothing had obscured it —no wife, no ties,
no alien thought. This trick of putting
coins together was himself, Harvey Ander-
son, his ultimate value to God and man.
Beyond it and its bleak accomplishment he
was a nothing.
The pounding in his brain subsided, and
he opened his eyes to find the room at rest
again. The door of the room was open, and
a woman was standing there holding the
handle, a diffident, hopeless-looking woman
with vacant eyes. Anderson sat up, implac-
able eyes staring out of his hard, alert head.
“How did you get here?” he shot at her.
“Who are you? And what do you want?”
“Me, Mister?” Her voice was as lifeless
as her face. “I pnly come for —for ’is pen.”
“For his pen? Whose pen? What on
earth do I know”
But a new sound broke in and cut his
indignation short. A sound of footsteps on
the stairs following the single boom of the
six o’clock gong. He leaned back on his
chair and listened while the faded woman
watched him with spent and hopeless eyes.
This was music to him—if he could have
known the phrase—this was the bells of
paradise. Twice a day this music fed him
for five minutes —just before half-past eight
and just after six. He put his head back
and listened, staring at the ceiling and oblivi-
ous of the woman in the doorway. A little
smile, crafty and happy, moved his lips as
the sound increased, roaring past his door
in the echoing concrete stairway. This was
power—rich, incalculable power. These hun-
dreds and hundreds of feet had been at work
for him all day, piling up the pounds, shil-
lings and pence for him. Now they were
thundering away to rest that they might
come thundering back to-morrow to work for
him again. These footsteps made his per-
sonal contact with the world. They were
his, his from the dawn till the dark. He
put his head on one side to hear the surge
of them, the smile still hovering about his
lips as the vast sound echoed through the
emptying building. For 20 years this had
fed him at the beginning and at the end of
each working day. this roar of the human
engines -working for him. They swept past
his door, swelling and receding and swelling
again as the six floors spilled the workers
into the shaft of the staircase and down into
the street. His footsteps—his beloved foot-
steps !
Soon the sound subsided and fell to a dis-
tant whisper, broken once or twice by some
hurrying, belated footstep, and shut off at
last to silence by the clang of the iron doors
of the employees’ entrance in the lane. All
the indignation gone from his manner, An-
derson turned to the woman again.
“Now, then,” he said, “what was it you
wanted ?”
“ ’ls pen, Mister.” The woman seemed
to be dead. “Les’s fountain-pen. ’E used
to leave it in the office —’e was that careful
of it ’e was afraid to carry it about with
’im, ’e said.”
She came farther into the room and stood
under the lights, where even Anderson could
see how haggard and worn she looked.
“But I don’t understand”
The dull voice interrupted him, seeming
only to brush the silence instead of breaking
it.
“It’s Leslie Penny, Mister —my boy. ’E
worked in the office here. I buried ’im to-
day. An’ ’e ’ad a fountain-pen I gave ’im
on ’is birthday—seein’ ’e was a clurk I
thought it’d be a good present. So it was,
too —’e thought a lot of it. An’ now —I’d
like to ’ave it, please, Mister, for a keep-
sake.”
.Leslie Penny? The name was tapping
vaguely at Anderson’s memory. Oh, yes—
sick, or said he was sick. Wanted a week
off to look after his mother or something.
And this was the mother
“P’raps Les -wasn't in your part of the
office, Mister. They told me downstairs to
go up to the first floor, but I couldn’t find
anyone till I come to your door.” She ceased
and looked vacantly at Anderson as if her
dull power of speech had given out.
“Well, I don’t know all the details of every
department, naturally. I’m Mr. Anderson.
But”
“You’re Mr. Anderson?” There was life
enough in the voice now. She came still
farther into the room, and stood facing him
at the table. For a moment she remained
looking down at him in silence. “Ye’re not
much like -what old Jock was,” she said at
last, aud with a cold equality in her voice
very different from her former diffidence.
“You don’t take after yer dad nor yer mum
neither.”
She paused again, and Anderson saw a
hard light flash into her eyes as she stood
thinking and watching him.
“Listen, Mr. Anderson.” she began. “A
ago Les was talkin’ to you in this
office; an’ to-day, as I told yer, I buried ’im.
I’m not crying over that. It’s what comes
to yer, an’ I’ve ’ad enough to know that
what’s cornin’ is cornin’. But it’s your fault.”
Anderson half rose from his chair.
“Look,” he said, a dry menace in his tone,
“if this is blackmail I warn you”
“Sit down,” she said coldly. “I want no-
thing blit ’is pen, an’ the chance of a few
-words. I’m not one for talkin’ much at
the best of time, but —well, a rough spin, you
could call it.”
Her mind, which was definite now and
withdrawn from its obscuring sorrow, seemed
to leave the hard little man in the chair to
look back for an instant upon the rough
spin.
“Les was diff’rent,” she said as if she were
speaking to herself. “’E was born at the
end of the drought that broke us—’Arry’s
selection wasn’t four mile from your dad’s,”
she threw at him in parenthesis and as if

A Touch of Antiseptic
ZAM-BVK takes away
all Pain and Danger.
INJURY to the skin means a breaking of
the protective layer of epidermis and the
admission of hordes of harmful germs that
set up a kind of local poisoning. Therefore,
be ready to apply at once a piece of lint or
clean rag smeared with Zam-Buk.
This powerful antiseptic balm destroys
harmful germs, draws off all poisonous matter,
soothes pain and quickly ends a peril which
even healthy people have to face.
If you had the eye of a microscope and
could see Zam-Buk knitting the edges of a
wound together you would witness one of
Nature’s miracles —the creation, cell by cell,
of new living tissue. You can always feel
safe in accident or skin disease with a box of
Zam-Buk close at hand.
Zam-Buk is proved by scientific test to be
absolutely pure. It contains no animal fat
and no mineral drug, as found in most
ointments. Zam-Buk is proved to be as
efficacious in cases of eczema, poisoned sores,
ringworm, piles, ulcers and other deep-seated
disease as it is soothing and healing for cuts,
burns, scalds, etc.
Dr. Andrew Wilson, Ph.D.,M.R., says:
“Zam-Buk is an ever-ready antiseptic dressing
which has the additional advantage of unique sooth-
ing and healing properties.”

he were a servant —“and ’e was born a bit
too soon. The others were all right, Jim
and Bill and Alf, but Les never seemed to
get ’is growth proper. Quiet V was, an’
thin —keepin’ ’imself to ’imself like. That’s
why I called ’im Leslie, an' not Jack or Arry
or .Toe, like the rest of ’em. Well, we went
broke —like your dad did,” she threw in
again—“an’ Dad got a job an’ the others
scattered. I saw that Les got a bit o’ school-
in’—’e took to that. An’ then Dad died,
an’ I brought Les down to Sydney. I knew
I’d ’ave to look after ’im for a good many
years—’e was never much, except for the
readin’ an’ that. I got cleanin’ an’ charin’
to do, an’ Les got a job in your office.
I told ’im to come ’ere ’an see you,
but ’e was too shy; they ’appened to want
a clurk, an’ took ’im on. ’E never seen you
till the other day.”
The vigorous, definite mind came back from
the rough spin and concentrated on the little
hard man.
“I’d ’ad tin 1 'flu, an’ ’e’d been lookin’ after
me, an’ caught it ’imself. Not bad —a few
days in bed would ’ave put 'im right. But
1 wasn’t earnin’, an’ ’e kept on workin’ ’ere.
I told ’im to speak to you, but ’e didn’t—
not till ’e ’ad to. An' you told ’im not to be
a fool; if ’e didn’t like ’is job ’e could get
’is envelope, you said. No sick pay was
your rule, you said. Your rule!” Measure-
less contempt dried up her voice for a
moment. “Well, it turned to pneumonia,
an’ ’e went off in a night. ’E’d never quite
got ’is growth; an’ ’e’d been workin’ ’ere
when ’e was ’alf-dead, because o’ your rules.”
There was a note of finality in her voice,
and she half-turned towards the door.
“There’s not much you can do ’ere in
Australia,” she said looking at the floor;
“skin the awards a bit ’ere an’ there, but
not much. But what you could do to Les
you did. I’ll never ’ear ’im cornin’ up the
stairs again.” A thought struck her, and
she turned back to the table. “Them foot-
steps—you seemed to like the sound o’ them
footsteps. D’ y’ ever think what they’re
goin’ to after they’re earned your bit o’
money for you? Tired, p’r'aps; draggin’
along. Worn out workin’ for you. Old,
p’raps, in your service.” The vast contempt
sounded again. “Your service! Or young
in it, lookin’ forward to all the life bein’
worked out o’ them to get your bit o' money
for you. Or sick. Or dyiri’.”
She leaned over the table and peered down
into his face.
“Some o’ them footsteps might be dyin’,
mister,” she whispered.
At the door she turned again.
“I’ll come for ’is pen to-morrow,” she said:
but the room was whirling round and round
again, and Anderson didn’t hear her. When
he opened his eyes she had gone.
On his way home he stopped at Sir John’s
in Macquarie-street. Sir John was • genial
but firm.
“No holiday for f>o years! My dear sir,
you millionaires are the biggest fools in the
world; you think you can do everything.
Get away. Get away and forget your shop
before you burst or l have to certify you for
Callan Park. Go out into the bush for three
months and cut wood or fish or play golf.
Three guineas.”
Sir John was a fool, of course. As big
a fool as that woman and her wretched boy.
He wished he had felt better; he’d have soon
put an end to her insolence!
After dinner he sat in the card-room for
half an hour, watching the members drift-
ing in and out, listening to the tinkle of
glasses. A wretched club, full of half-witted
fools stamping about! Why couldn’t they
buy a decent carpet? You might just as
well be in a warehouse for the din of the
passing feet. Soon he went to bed, his own
footsteps along the corridor being the last
irritation of the day.
At twenty past eight he Avas in his office
refreshed and ready for the day. The morn-
ing footsteps were not so rich and satisfy-
ing as those of the evening; they straggled
a good deal and never quite reached the full
volume and power of the six o’clock vintage.
Nevertheless, they were heartening, very
heartening; and you always had the six
tf’clock to look forward to. A couple of
dizzy spells came and went; he thought of
Sir John and the three guineas, remembered
that place of Woodridge’s at Linden —the
camp on Avhicli he had foreclosed last year
—but soon he remembered the shop and the
footsteps, and pushed all the nonsense out
of his mind. He was only 55 ; and no one*
could say he had led a careless life. Sir
John was a fool. He would diet and go to
bed early. Nothing in it. Besides, he
couldn’t be spared, with the half-yearly sale
coming on and the stocktaking to follow.
The days came and went. Work became
heavy and irksome instead of the inspiring
thing it had been. The dizziness increased.
And, worst of all. the footsteps got on his
nerves. It was this last unimaginable thing
that finally decided him to take Sir John’s
advice. At first only a tiny whisper of
menace seemed to sound at the heart of the
roar, only the merest shadow of threat. But
it worried; and it came back in fugitive
dreams, came back in any sound of running
feet, came back in silences —and worried,
worried. He forced himself to sit through
the six o’clock thunder, he that had loved
it ; and gradually he surrendered—got to the
office at nine o’clock and left at five, dodging
the footsteps. But people still walked about
in the club; and you couldn’t carpet the
world. In the streets they clattered along,
iron-shod and indifferent; on the bare floors
behind the counters they shuffled and hur-
ried ; on your brain they beat through the
night.
In the end he gave in and went to Linden,
to Woodridge’s old camp, two miles from the
station —left Lockyer and Dwight’s as it
stood and buried himself. And it was good.
The clean mountain air, the silence, the
change—Sir John was right. He slept like
a boy the first night, cut wood all the fol-
lowing day and could hardly keep awake
after nightfall. Three months was rubbish:
a fortnight of this would do it.
But on the second evening a footstep
sounded on the verandah. Curious—there
were only six houses at Linden, and the
nearest was a mile away. He went out:
no one—not a soul! Yet it had been dis-
tinct. He searched the house, the shed, the
garden. Nothing. He must have been wrong.
His bewilderment only half-subsided; but
he went to bed and to. sleep, too tired to
worry himself with it further.
-Next day the woodcutting was not so en-
grossing, the silence and calm apparently not
quite so complete. And when dusk fell an-
other footfall sounded on the boards of the
verandah, and with it a companion. Two
people were out there walking. For no
reason Anderson glanced at his watch: six
o’clock. He sat up in his chair, white and
shaking. But he forced himself to search
the place again, not hoping this time to find
anything, or only very faintly hoping. Back
in the room he fought hard for control, and
at last got himself into a chair before a
roaring fire, an open book in his hand.
Drugged by the heat and the long day in
the air he fell asleep until a faint tap-
tapping woke him with a start. The room,
was grey in the moonlight, the dead tire
grey on the hearth. And through the house,
on the bare boards and the strips of linoleum
people were walking, walking. For a moment
Anderson endured it. the vile distress of its
panic, wrenching his quivering mind round
to face it. Buttressed by 40 years of con-
trol, somehow lie got himself into bed and
stuck it till the. dawn, the footsteps shuf-
fling and stumbling, hurrying, pausing, tap-
tapping through the night, fading to a sul-
len silence only as the pale morning broke.
Feverishly he scoured the bush for dead
limbs and dragged them into the little yard,
cutting them up and trimming the faggots
until his back ached. He must exhaust him-
self, reach his last moment of endurance, that
ar dusk he could fall asleep and dodge the
dreadful night. But at nightfall the crowd
came back, marching round and round the
house, clattering on the hollow floors, trip-
ping past the doorways, dragging along the
verandah as if the walkers never hoped to
reach, home. The sound swelled to the mighty
thunder that he knew, pealing and roaring
through the moonlit darkness, a foul menace
of terror at its heart.
So they had followed him. He lifted his
abject head—no place that could hide him,
no small spot where he could be safe....
What to do —what, under God, to do?
The thunder grumbled down and ceased
for a moment. Had they gone—God of
mercy, had they gone? Listening, he sud-
denly started from his chair and stepped
out on to the verandah, his face livid and
his heart making a new thunder in his
throat. Far off down the road, on the edge
of the moonlight, a muttering disturbed the
night, a murmur of distant running feet.
He caught at the verandah-rail, and licked
dry lips with a dry tongue. They had found
him ; all the footsteps in the world had found
him. For a space the far-off whispering con-
tinued, Anderson listening, listening. Soon
it became a hurricane of beating feet sweep-
ing into the stillness like a devastating wind.
Anderson listened, his useless hands fumbling
at the rail, his eyes bright with panic.
These would be on him in a moment.
Suddenly he tore his hands from the rail
and leapt down the steps to the pathway.
The gate swung behind him as he rushed into
the road, the driving tide of footsteps in his
wake.
These thundered behind him, the menace
in the burgeoning sound creeping nearer and
nearer. The walls of the bush beside the
grey ribbon of road blurred and swayed as
lie ran sobbing between them, the awful
stamping and beating closing up behind him.
To keep up to keep up, and get beyond
them! His heart choked him as the moon-
light reeled round his straining head. All
the feet that had ever walked the earth
pursued him....
These caught him, swept over him. They
ground his face in the dust, trampled him
to death upon the roadway. He felt them
clattering over him, some hurrying, some
shuffling, some dragging, worn out with the
day, soifie strong in youth, some stumbling
in old age. Stamping, tunning, walking,
pausing, they passed over him, and swept
away into the distance, the roar of their
passing falling at last to silence.
Here on the roadway the store-boy found
his body in the early morning, face down-
ward in the dust, a blot on the grey ribbon
of the road.
HILARY LOFTING.
In Hyde Park.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I saw an old man sitting ’neath a tree
With all an_old man’s calm simplicity.
I knew his thoughts with things w r e had
forgot
(Or later things that we remembered not)
Were busy while in crowds he sat alone
With that strange vision that to age is
known.
So I sat down beside him. Soon he said :
“It’s hot to-day—the moon last night was
red.”
“Is that a sign?” I asked him, and I smiled.
“A right rare sigh indeed,” he said; “my
child,
I’ve been a sailor, and I’ll make a bet
A red moon never brought a frost-bite yet.”
He mopped his brow and scratched a sun-
burned ear.
“But we’ll have rain to-morrow, never fear.
The first mate of the old Sea Wasp—that’s
me—
I know the weather as I know the sea.”
And, somehow, as he spoke, my heart felt
sore
For that old man and the old coat he wore.
I liked his old gnarled hands and salt-brown
fingers;
I liked the light as when a sunset lingers
That lit the dreams he wove when thus
sun-dozing,
Dreams that were vivid once now dimly
closing—
A human barqqe sailing where ships descend
The western bar where all life’s journeys
end.
He looked into my eyes a little space;
Perhaps he understood and read my face.
His long look told he liked me, and I knew
He guessed I liked him in the same way,
too—
Souls may approach and signal on strange
tides
As the grim captain, Destiny, decides....
* * * *
I sighed this morning when I saw the rain,
Remembering that old ma.n’s coat again.
