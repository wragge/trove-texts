R. L. S.’s Sydney Associations
Robert Louis Stevenson died at Samoa on
December 3, 1894, from a cerebral haemor-
rhage. He had always been a weak man,
physically: he had suffered from tuberculosis
liis whole life long. But the real facts as
to his death and its causes have only lately
been stated in print for the first time, 30
years after, in the new biography by J, A.
Stewart. This writer brings to light at
the same time much early history of R.L.S.’s
family life before he' married and about his
Bohemian days which, up to the present, has
not been considered quite suitable for publi-
cation. But, now it is all down in black and
white, one can only say that there is nothing
very terrible, about it, after all. The whole
subject is just another illustration of a
common fault in biography. Suppress or
gloss over unpleasant facts about a promi-
nent man’s life story, and a worse impres-
sion is created in the public mind than if all
the facts were plainly told. But tell them
and have done, and it will be found that
whatever is unsavory becomes less so by
being treated with candor. Stewart is
franker in his treatment of Stevenson than
any previous writer, yet with it all perfectly
reverent.
During the war a Sydney journalist, a
close student of Stevensoniana, made the
suggestion that, as R.L.S. had paid several
visits here and met many of the city’s pro-
fessional and artistic people, something
memorable might be done in the way of
forming a Stevenson Society or putting up a
monument. Other places, like San Fran-
cisco and Edinburgh, had done this; we had
done it ourselves in the case of Burns. Why
not in the case of the other great Scot whom
some of us' had met, whom we all knew in
the way we know a legend? Apparently the
time and the man to give a lead have not yet
presented themselves. There is said to be
on record, I am not sure where, some inti-
mate matter relating to Stevenson’s sojourn-
ings in Sydney and down the South Coast.
If it were possible to have this reprinted it
would make a valuable footnote to Steven-
soniana. And, in the light of the voracious
demand, particularly in America, for even
the most trifling items about Stevenson’s
life, there is little chance that it would turn
out a literary frost. The most suitable illus-
tration might be the well-known portrait by
Nerli which has been in Sydney for the last
20 years at least. This suggestion is offered
as being perhaps more workable than the
first.
Stevenson’s first voyage to Sydney was in
February, 1890. He had previously made
plans to buy the Samoan property of Vai-
lima, and with his party was on liis way
back to Scotland to settle up his affairs. The
latter idea, of course, never came to fruition.
He put up at the Union Club, liis family at
lodgings. Almost ..the first thing he did was
to write the notorious open letter to Dr.
Hyde, of Honolulu, dealing with Father
Damien. This is dated February 20. The
matchless piece of invective was written in
a single morning, at white heat, and printed
in the Australian Star. Later on a pam-
phlet was made of it, and 25 copies printed
by the Ben Franklin Printing Co. One
copy is in the Mitchell Library, said to be
the only one in Australia. He refused to
take any of the proceeds from the sale of
the letter, instructing his publishers to pay
over the profits to the Leper Settlement at
Molokai. Considered opinion has declared
the letter to have been a mistake. Steven-
son’s overheated chivalry outran liis native
sense of justice. But what a piece of writing !
The Sydney climate disagreed with Steven-
son on every occasion he was here. During
these few weeks lie had a haemorrhage,' the
first for 18 months. It kept him on a diet
of drugs and egg-flips and prevented him see-
ing much of the place. He did manage, how-
ever, to roam about a little with Lloyd
Osbourne and pick up some local color for
“The Wrecker.” The passages in that book
about the Domain and the railway cutting
in the Illawarra will come to mind. There
is nothing, not a word, about our beautiful
harbor. There is a story to the effect that
he wanted to relieve his tedium by playing
his flageolet, but the cast-iron rules of the
Union Club wouldn’t allow that.
His health was so bad lie had, after a
few weeks, to be carried in a stretcher on
board the Janet Nicoll, a trading-vessel on
her way to the South Seas. His wife had
a lot of trouble getting berths on the cockle-
shell, but it was a matter of life or death
for Stevenson. It was on this cruise, which
lasted several months, that he got to know
Jack Brickland, an original character,
whom he drew as Tommy Haddon in “The
Wrecker.” The Janet Nicoll returned to
Sydney with Stevenson, who again stayed
at the Union Club, working hard on liis
South Sea Letters, almost prostrate with
sickness and in perpetual fear of reprisals
from Dr. Hyde. When he returned to Samoa,
almost immediately, it was to make his home
there for ever.
The following year, again in February, he
sailed for Sydney, to meet his mother, on
her way to Samoa to make her home with
him now her husband was dead. Stevenson
relates in his “Vailima Letters” how he
found with annoyance the Sydney climate
never suited him. He had a “sharp, swinge-
ing attack” on this idsit; the only time lie
dined in company was with Bernhard Wise:
he played on his flageolet, roamed the streets,
and had dinner once at a French restaurant
in Wynyard-square.
It was not till February, 1893. that Sydney
/saw any more of him. His fame by this
time was more secure than ever, and during
the several weeks’ holiday he allowed himself
he seems to have mixed more with people
than on any previous occasion. He describes
it as an “amusing but tragic holiday,” but
the tragic part was more on account of his
womenfolk, who were ill the whole time. He
himself was entertained by the Presbyterian
Assembly, “likewise at a sort of artistic
club; made speeches at both, and may there-
fore he said to have been, like Saint Paul,
all things to all men.” He had some excel-
lent photos taken by Kerry, and St. Gaudeus,
the French sculptor, made a medallion of
him. It would seem ho stayed at various
places—in Macquarie-street, at the Oxford
Hotel, King-street, and at the Athenaeum
and Australian Clubs. Stories are told of
the pleasure liis vivacious conversation gave.
He met Professor Anderson Stuart and Dr.
Fairfax Ross, as well as Daplyn the artist,
was much with Archibald, in Tiie Bulletin
office, and w T as entertained at the artists’
colony at Mosman. It is related that he wished
to meet David Scott Mitchell, the great
collector and benefactor of the Mitchell
Library, but that Mitchell took offence at
some of his Bohemian mannerisms. Alto-
gether a delightful stay despite one period
when he had to keep to his room. It was
his last visit to the world of populous cities.
He returned to Vailima, to hear accounts
of his fame from all parts of the world, and
for about two years he worked furiously to
deserve even better. In a new access of
creative effort he started on “Weir of
Hermiston.” He "was working on it the day
he died. He judged it, as does the world, the
best thing he had ever written.

Back to the Bush
The last Christmas that Henry Lawson
and I had together we spent in camp on
a bend of the Murrumbidgee. We had
arranged the trip some days ahead, deciding
to go down the day before Christmas Eve,
and return in time for dinner on Christmas
Day. What a time we had in making our
preparations! Whatever he was in other
ways, as a camper Lawson was the king of
optimists. “Jim,” he'd say, "Hour, tea and
sugar and a bit of salt are all we want.”
And he'd try to insist on it, too; but our
respective households thought otherwise, and
when all the baggage and other things were
put together, including fishing-lines, a bor-
rowed gun and a good store of tobacco, there
was much more than we could take on the
sulky. My boy Frank was coming with
us, too. So I fossicked round amongst the
neighbors, and was able to borrow a dilapi-
dated old spring-cart that had once belonged
to a butcher, and which, although the top,
front and seat had long ago disappeared,
was still a bit greasy in places. Painted in
big, white letters on one side was “Butcher,”
and on the back, scroll-wise, “Civility and
cleanliness.” But the cart was strong and
roomy, and it suited our purpose. Anyhow,
by the time we had everything aboard there
wasn’t much of it visible except the wheels.
It was late in the afternoon when we
started. Henry was in joyous mood, singing
scraps of old songs and joking with the boy.
As we crossed the Narrandera-llay road
a teamster hailed us. He knew Lawson, and
remarked: “The last time I saw you, you
were with the King and Queen.” Frank and
I did not grasp his meaning, but after we had
passed on a bit Henry said: “He meant the
picture in the Art Gallery.” At the river we
hobbled the old horse and put a bell on him.
This pleased Henry immensely, for it made
him feel that we were once more in the
bush and doing as we used to do. We pitched
camp at the butt of a big tree, and when
night blotted out all but our immediate sur-
roundings Lawson seemed to feel that he had
found a haven of calm and peace. He re-
marked that the blanky old bush was para-
dise enough for him.
The. fish did not bite, so we spread our
rugs and smoked and talked, and some of the
time we just smoked and thought, sometimes
filling our pipes from my plug, and at other
times from his tin. Lawson always main-
tained that there w r as no borrowing or lend-
ing between mates —what one had the other
was welcome to —-and while we were together
we lived up to it, an arrangement, by the way,
that always made me the gainer ; he saw to
that. Talking of tobacco reminds me that
in latter years he could smoke the lightest
flake-cut and the darkest plug with the same
enjoyment, just as he drank the weakest and
the strongest tea with equal relish.
While we were at breakfast next morning
some friends, passing in a ear, left us a
small case of beer. After they had gone
s Law_son took the box between his knees,
peering at me first quizzically and then mis-
chievously. But soon a seriousness came
over him. “We won’t open it, Jim,” he said.
“If we did it would spoil everything for
Frank.” And we stuck to that. I was
always fond of Henry. But I loved him then
for that generous consideration of the boy.
Later in the forenoon the boy went for
a ride on the old horse, and as Yanko
station was less than a mile away we de-
cided we’d walk there, and see if we could
cadge a bit of tucker. Not that we were
short of anything, but we’d do it for the
sake of old times, Lawson said, and to see if
we felt the same as in the old days. I
was to be spokesman, but as a cadger I
failed completely, for when a little red-faced
cook with blue eyes came to the door I said :
“Could you sell us some eggs?” Owing to
his deafness, Lawson hadn’t heard what I
said, and he broke in with: “Just a bit of
bread and meat’ll do. We’ve got tea and
sugar.” I did not wait for an answer, but
said quickly: “This is Henry Lawson.”
Those blue eyes were bulging before, but
they almost left their sockets now. as their
owner _ said in excited tones: “Come in!
Come in!” Soon enamel plates were spin-
ning in front of us ; knives, forks and panni-
kins beside them; a cold roast leg of mutton
in its tin dish bumped on the table and was
followed by half a big plum-duff. As we
ate, the cook whispered to me: “I write a
bit of poetry myself. Do you think he would
read it and say what he thinks of it?” I
repeated his request, but Henry side-stepped
it by saying that he hadn't his glasses, and
without them he couldn’t read a line. He
explained to me afterwards that he wouldn't
read it, as if it were bad it would hurt the
man to tell him so, and it would be cruel to
say it was good if it were not.
As we sat there some of the men came in
and passed through, and as the cook whis-
pered to them who Henry was, their faces
were a jstudy. Some scowled in disbelief,
others looked impressed and lingered to say
a few words. After the meal Henry walked*
over to an empty letter-rack, rubbing his
hand meditatively over its surface. “What
tales it could tell,” he said, “hope, love and
despair, and God knows what!”

THE ENGINE is 4-cycle, valve-in-head, air-
cooled, self-cranking, runs on kerosene, and is
direct connected to generator. The crank-
shaft and connecting rod are drop forged, and
heat treatment is used where hardness is
necessary. The main bearings are Hyatt roller
and New Departure ball-bearings.
THE GENERATOR is 4- P oi„,
shunt wound, fitted with carbon
brushes, and has a slotted com-
mutator. A switchboard to con-
trol the current is mounted on the
generator.
DISTRIBUTORS:
DELCO-LIGHT is a com-
plete electric light and
? power plant, and is
made in 25 different sizes—a
size for every need.
It consists of a kerosene engine,
direct connected to an electric
generator which produces
electricity to be either used
immediately in lights, motors,
etc., or stored in a storage
battery or accumulator for
future use.
Delco-Light is not a new and
hastily constructed mechan-
ism. It has been sold in ever
increasing numbers since 1916,
and before it was marketed
years of labor and a quarter of
a million dollars were spent to
develop the plant from a belt-
driven, water-cooled outfit into
a direct-connected, air-cooled,
compact unit.
The Delco-Light Plant of to-
day differs considerably from
the earlier plants. Experience
has shown the wisdom of
eliminating certain features
and of altering others, but it
has demonstrated that the
essential features in the origi-
nal design were correct.
A quarter of a million Delco-Light plants
have been sold to date, and the enormous
output of the factory enables the Delco-
Light Company to produce a quality
product at a price impossible to its
competitors.
Time has proved
the durability of
DELCO - LIGHT
THE ACCUMULATOR is a
thick plate, Long Life Battery of
ample capacity. The elements
are in glass jars and the insula-
tion between plates is wood-
board and perforated ebonite.

As we were about to leave I noticed that
the cook went to the front door and looked
first in this direction and then in that, and
then did the same at the back door. I under
stood what it meant a few moments later,
when he hastily wrapped what was lett ot
the food in newspaper, and, shoving it holus-
bolus into a sugar-bag, handed it to me,
saying • “Keep it under your coat till you re
out of sight.” He was generous, that cook,
and we both wondered if his poetry was as
good as his duff. As we skirted a billabong
and threaded our way through the seedling
gums Lawson asked if I remembered the old
days when, with tucker-bags well filled, we d
slink quietly away from the hilts like crim-
inals, never feeling really sure of our luck
till the food was safely dumped beside our
camp-fire.
At sundown the fish were biting., and
Henry’s spirits were as blithe as a boy s; he
appeared almost as active as one, too, as he
scrambled up and slithered down the banks
or climbed along dangerous logs that over-
hung the water to unfasten lines that were
entangled. About midnight we boiled the
billy and toasted some of the cold pudding,
and then he decided to clean the fish we had
caught. In the firelight he sat cleaning and
scraping and wrapping each one carefully in
its own fold of wet bag, and long after Frank
had gone to sleep and I had been dozing I
could hear him moving restlessly from fire to
water’s edge and feeling his way amongst
the fallen timber to the lines.
' Later, as he sat gazing across the fire into
the water, I saw that his eyes glowed, and
I knew then that the day had been too much
for him. The trip had too vividly recalled
the old days, and the excitement of our un-
usual luck at fishing and the want of sleep
had all helped to bring him almost to the
verge of hysteria. After a while he calmed
down, and as he squatted there, looking such
an old, old, tired man, I felt a great pity
for him, and shuffled barefoot over to him.
As I touched his head he started. “What
are you dreaming of?” I asked, and lie
answered slowly and simply: “Mary Gil-
more. I would like to write now.” And he
added: “You know, Jim, I haven’t many
more writing years left.”
After that a faint greyness crept through
the bush and a fine shaft of sunlight skimmed
along the surface of the river, and it was
Christmas Day. I poked up the fire, and we
prepared breakfast; but I noticed that,
although he gulped down his tea, he wasn’t
eating. I urged, and then, for the first
time during our long mateship, he was peev-
ish. But it was over in an instant, and
he smiled and said: “Later on, Jim. Later
on.”
JIM GRAHAME.
Song in Australia
The rising generation’s msthetic sense is
in imminent danger of atrophy from (a)
American films, and (b) the music-hall
ballad, mostly American in origin, and the
utterly soul-deadening, ear-tickling and artis-
tically worthless jazz, also of American or
Africo-American origin. To counteract this,
what is the State doing to- encourage a
knowledge of and love for the best in music?
It holds summer schools to teach its teachers
tonic sol-fa. It aims at getting its teachers'
to teach quiet, unforced voice-production and
to insist on soft, sweet singing. And in some
schools it gets artistic and delightful results.
That, however, depends almost entirely upon
the personality, equipment, skill and taste of
the teacher of the child.
But it is mainly to the subject matter
of the singing, the actual songs taught, that
I wish to direct attention. lam still a
quarter of a century off the retiring age,
but I have actually heard in a Victorian
metropolitan school a class of six-year-old
infants singing this :
My coffin must be ;
Six angels at the back;
Two to sing and two to pray,
And two to carry my soul away!
Dreadful, isn’t it! But so is this, which
these ears have heard in a N.S.W. State
school
There’s no silver lining in any cloud
Like the silver in my mother’s hair.
Also the unspeakable bathos of “Memories.”
Surely such sentimental slush should find
no place in our national schools. What,
then, should one teach?
School songs are destined to mould the
aesthetic taste of the nation. Unless some-
thing is to be done to prevent the present
flooding of our juvenile emotional world with
“It Ain’t Goin ’to Rain No Mo”’ our people
will ever continue to wallow in sentimental
hog-wash. The method of attacking these
pestilential invaders is to teach better stuff.
Suppose the Education Departments would
combine in an effort to get all the school
children of the States to learn 20 worthy
songs, nothing high faultin, nothing mere-
tricious, but all good, sound, singable songs
of a gay or tender emotion,, rollicking,
pathetic without being maudlin, national in
a broad patriotic sense, and, where possible,
characteristic of sound Australian sentiment.
(I fear I must candidly admit that I do
not know a really Australian song, racy of
the soil and musically front-rank: “Waltzing
Matilda,” “When Your Pants Begin to Go,”
and “The Song of the Cattle Hunters” would,
however, all be worth our children’s learn-
ing.) I should like to venture on a selection
of these 20 standard songs, mainly because
it would probably call forth rival lists, and
in this way one could gain what a music-
lover desires most in the world —an introduc-
tion to other music previously unknown to
him. Before compiling the list, let me men-
tion my sources
(1) “School Songs,” edited and arranged by
August Siede, 6d., Allan and Co. ; out of print. August
Siede died a few weeks ago in London. It remains
to be seen whether he has left original work com-
mensurate with his great talents. This little book
is worth every teacher’s possessing. I trust it will
be reprinted.
(2) “The High School Song Book,” issued by the
H.S.T. Association of Victoria, 25.; also probably
out of print, but worth reprinting. Mr. Fred Earp
has here made an admirable selection for youngsters
of High School age.
(2) “The Australasian Students’ Song Book,”
published by George Robertson and Co., Melbourne.
An interesting selection of student songs, though,
alas, many miles behind the real book noted.
(4) “The Scottish Students’ Song Book” (London;
Bayley and Ferguson). This superb collection is
undoubtedly ■ the best volume of students’ songs in
English. It. may be had in many editions. It is
interesting to notice that it contains early verses by
our Professor R. J. A. Berry and other local men.
(5) “A Golden Treasury of Song,” edited by
Norman O’Neill : Boosey and Go. This beautiful
book contains 50 of the greatest songs ever written.
It is severely classical and of interest to more
advanced students.
(6) “Australian Song Books,” selected and
arranged by G. T. Ootterill and 11. F. Treharne;
Philip and Son, Sydney; 4d. per book. These four
books contain some good songs and are for the most
part very suitable in character. They do not,
however, seem to me to be severe enough in selection.
Here, now, is my list of the 20 school
songs I should like the pupils of all schools
in Australia *to learn during the next 12
months. (I do not think the number exces-
sive, because, rather than allow the present
denJorable state of things to continue, I
would even consent to their being taught by
ear) :
(1) “The Best School of All”; words by Henry
Newbolt, music by L. A. Adamson, Melbourne Wesley
College. As a school song this would indeed be
difficult to beat.
(2) “Drink to Me only with Thine Eyes,” Three
hundred years old and as verdant as ever.
(3) “Hail, Smiling Morn!” (Reginald Stofforth).
Robust, vigorous, characteristically English.
(4) “Heart of Oak.” Written in the “year of
victories” by David Garrick.
(5) “The Marseillaise.” Most magnificent of
national anthems.
(6) “The Bailiff’s Daughter of Islington.” An
exquisite English ballad ; may be sung dramatically.
(7) “My Lodging Is in Cellar Cool,” also sung
to the words “Believe Me If All Those Endearing
Young Charms.” This is an English, not Irish,
tune, Moore’s words superseding others that are less
sentimental. Has any other nation a melody to
equal this one?
(8) “The Dusky Night Rides Down the Sky.”
Fielding’s song is breezy and rollicking.
(9) “The Admiral’s Broom.” A so-called drawing-
room ballad that is very suitable for boys, who
enter into its spirit. • ,
(10) “Men of Harlech.” Dear to Welshmen and
all of British stock.
(11) “My Native Land.” Sung to the lovely
tune that advocates of the Red Flag have usurped.
(12) “Fair Daffodils.” Herrick's immortal words
set to a lovely folk melody.
(13) “The Harp That Once.” A beautiful Irish
melody with Moore’s words.
(14) “Bright Is the Moon.” An arrangement by
F. Earp of “La Donna e Mobile” of Verdi; a very
successful part song. Musical critics at present in-
cline to deride the melody as tinsel, but it persists
despite them.
(15) “The Linden Tree.” One of the most beauti-
ful of Schubert’s simple songs. .
(16) “Tom Bowling.” Dibdiri’s plain yet graphic-
sea song.
(17) “Toll for the Brave.” Cowper’s noble dirge
set to Handel’s equally noble march.
(18) “May Bells and Flowers.” Mendelssohn’s
charming duet. . . ,
(19) “The Mermaid” (“ ’Twas Friday Morning ).
A genuine sea chanty ; a delicious mixture oi humoi
and pathos: should be sung to the original rough
words.
(20) “Bridal Chorus” from “Lohengrin.” The
practice of Australian children singing choruses
at weddings (even their teachers’!) should be en-
couraged.
I should like to‘ enumerate the other SO
to make the number up to the one hundred
songs we should all know, hut this little
list should suffice to indicate what might
with advantage be aimed at in our schools.
Probably there is more than one suspects in
the dictum of Fletcher of Saltoun who said,
“Let me be the writer of the people’s songs,
and I care not who makes their laws.”
These songs could at least be made a very
real bond of unity amongst the children of
the Australian States.
ALEX C. WELSH.
Hilaire Belloc
Joseph Hilaire Pierre Belloc, now in his
55th year, humorist, novelist, essayist, poet,
historian, traveller, politician, economist,
propagandist, Catholic and journalist, lias
just drawn together the threads of long
and busy life in "The Cruise of the Nona.”
He has lived, in Shaw’s phrase, “up to his
neck in his time,” and “The Cruise” is a
fitting memorial to his achievement and ex-
perience.
It is difficult to say why Hilaire Belloc is
not in the front rank of writers. He has
done work in several fields which is incom-
parable in our day: his satirical political
novels (“Mr. Clutterbuck’s Election, ’ "A
Change in the Cabinet,” "Pongo and the
Bull”) arc the only rivals in the language to
Disraeli’s; “Emmanuel Burden” is a master-
piece of sustained satire and dignified
pathos; his ironical “children’s” verses are
so remarkably good that it calls for nothing
short of a genius to oust him from first place
in that sort of thing; his poetry proper is
rather skilful than inspired, but nevertheless
attains a very high level, and it has been
maintained that “lie has written one of the
perfect poems in English”; his essays arc
often very charming and always so provoca-
tive or whimsical that it is safe to predict
that Belloc will never want for a place m
anthologies; his political and economic writ-
ing is clear, vivid and arresting in both
style and thought—“ The Party System” is
a magnificent piece of political analysis (and
invective), and “The Servile State” pre-
sented a more than plausible view of the
trend of modern legislation and, incidentally,
added its title to English political idiom.
And this does not cover the whole of
Belloc’s claim on our attention. His early
humorous books (e.g., “Caliban’s Guide to
Letters”) are academic and “date” horribly,
but his travel miscellanies (notably “The
Four Men,” “The Path to Rome” and “Hills
and the Sea”) are delightful and original
exercises in this genre, studded with wit.
anecdote, exhortation, description, verse and
the bonhomie of the rucksack, the open road
and the wayside inn. His polemical books,
too, are worth more than casual notice. “The
Jews” is the provocative and forceful expres-
sion of a highly original view of the “Jewish
Problem” and its solution. His historical
studies (polemical, propagandist and aggres-
sive in the highest degree— e.g., the recent
“Europe and the Faith”) have about them
more of the dust of the arena than that of
the study and library, but that is the last
reason why they should be tossed lightly
aside.
The man who could produce such a volume
of writing (over 40 books in all) of such
high quality, besides unknown but vast
quantities of journalistic work, is a man to
be reckoned with in modern letters. He has
always been associated, both in fact and in
the public mind, with G. K. Chesterton, and.
indeed, in a certain sense we may say that
Belloc is to Chesterton as Sidney Webb is
to Bernard Shaw—the source of the solid
material, the arsenal from which the publi-
cist draws his missiles. But Belloc is a
greater man than Webb—he is an artist as
well as a man of wide knowledge.
But still, in the face of all this, Belloc is
not in the front rank. It is useless to say
tluat he suffers from being a polemist; Shaw
also is a polemist; Wells is a polemist;
Galsworthy is a polemist; most of the con-
siderable literary artists of our time must
he so described, but, whatever harm it may
do them in other directions, it has not pre-
vented the growth of their artistic quality.
Nor can it be urged that Belloc lacks sin-
cerity, for he is almost morbidly sincere.
He has remarkable literary skill, too, and
one or two short pieces of his prose are
unique for dignity and grandeur in modern
writing.
The most satisfactory solution of the
problem appears to me to lie in his extra-
ordinary fluency. He is too prolific. He
turns out too much, and while a good deal
of it is superior, and some superb, yet the
very quantity of his output has spoiled the
artist. It is quite on the boards that his
generation lost one of the masters of Eng-
lish prose from the mere fact that Belloc
had to make a living out of journalism—
and did it with an ease that was too con-
summate.
“The Cruise of the Nona” is an epitome of
the man’s work as a whole. It may lose
readers by its unfortunate title —it is very
much more than a mere travel book—but it
will gain them as the years pass. It ex-
presses the whole of Belloc better than any-
thing he has written. The general frame-
work rests, certainly, on a cruise in his little
boat (“thirty feet over all. with eight or
nine feet beam, and drawing from live to six
feet Of'Water.' cutter rigged” 1, but there are to
be found tales, reminiscences, homilies, queer
characters and queerer, beliefs, philosophising
and moralising, irrelevaneies and sudden,
lively glimpses of the life he has led. shrewd
worldly wisdom, preaching, and. here and
there, breath-bereaving pieces of beautiful
writing. It is a long book, and it is not a
book that' can or should be read at a sitting,
but it is a delightful and candid account of
the essentials of one unusual man’s life.
Here you will find what Belloc thinks of
Catholicism, the War, Socialism, Fools, Par-
liament, the word “cad” and other words.
Leadership, Literary Fame, Rt. David and
Life in General. And the assurance of one
reader, at any rate, may be taken that what
he thinks about these, or anything, it is a
high pleasure to discover —if only to differ
from and refute.
WARREN GRAVES.
“Japonica”: Many publishing firms make the
cautious announcement in their novels that none ot
the characters have been, drawn from life. In days
of old they were not so afraid of libel. In Disraeli s
first novel, “Vivian (trey,” a “key” was published.
“Vivian Grey” was Disraeli himself; “Sherborne,”
the elder Disraeli ; the “Marquis of Carabas,’ Lord
Lyndhurst; “Duke of Juggernaut,” the Duke of
Norfolk ; “Prince of Little Lilliput,” Prince Leopold ;
“Mrs. Million,” Mrs. Coutts; “Foaming Fudge,”
Lord Brougham; and so on.
“Ancient Mariner”: It isn’t polite to contradict
a lady, but I cannot accept Ida Lee’s statement, in
her recently published “Early Explorers in Aus-
tralia,” that Cook’s Endeavour flew the white ensign
as she nosed her way along our eastern seaboard.
What she flew was the red ensign. At that period.
Britain’s fighting fleet was composed of three divi-
sions:—the red, the white and the blue, each
flying an ensign of corresponding color; but when
this divisional arrangement came to be abolished
in 1864, the red and blue ensigns were likewise
abandoned, and the white ensign retained as the
distinctive flag of all British warships. Prior to
that year it often happened that ships from all
three divisions were brought together in a naval
action, and in such cases they would all fly' the
ensign of the admiral in chief command. Hov.e
was an admiral of the Red and Nelson of the
White; hence the red ensign flew at the Glorious
First of June (1794) and the white ensign at
the Nile and Trafalgar. The Endeavour wasn’t
attached to any of the fighting squadrons, nor
was she subject to the control of an Admiral in
command of a naval station. She w T as sailing under
the orders of the Lords of the Admiralty, and
would therefore fly' what was then the standard
Admiralty emblem —the red ensign. Again, the
volume informs us that “on the night of April
30 —by civil reckoning—Cook lost one of his ship’s
company', Forby Sutherland.” If this is meant to
imply that Forby took his last departure on April
30, as civil time is now computed locally', the
authoress is quite wrong. Cook’s record reads:
“Tuesday, May 1. At 6 p.m. departed this life
Forby Sutherland. A.M. sent the body' ashore to be
buried,” and to bring this into conformity with our
standard time, the rule is as simple as it is inexor-
able. All that needs to be done is to advance
Cook’s a.m. times a full day, and leave his p.m.
times just as they stand. We thus find that Forby
made his exit at 6 p.m. of May 1, and was buried
ashore in the a.m. of May 2. By the same rule
we find that Cook sighted Botany Bay at 6 a.m.
of April 29, and entered it at 1 p.m. of the same
day.

Meat and all foods Kept
fresh as long; as you want
RELVINATOR
Wherever you live the question of food conservation is important. The station-owner
need never throw out meat if he installs a Kelvinator. He can have fresh meat all the
time. The saving in this direction alone makes Kelvinator an investment, not a luxury,
to the man on the land. The summer problem of keeping things cool is acute every-
where. Meat, milk, butter, eggs, all can be kept in the cold, dry air of Kelvinator
as long as you wish.
Foods actually improve in the Kelvinator. There is no ice needed, for the temperature
is maintained at the same level of cold by the refrigerating unit. You can make ice,
though, more than you can use, if you want it. Think of the difference Kelvinator
would make in your home. Beautifully kept foods, dainty frozen dishes, ice, ice-cream
and countless pleasant things in the hottest weather, and at a ridiculously small cost.

“Whv, slie looks as young and charming as her daughter.” How
often have you heard these words spoken about women who have retained
their girlish appearance while their family is quickly growing up around
them ! Have you ever stopped to think what the real secret of their
vouth is? The turning-point of youth to early middle-age comes "lien a
little silvery grey creeps in amongst that crowning glory of wornen-*-their
hair. No matter the youthful bloom upon the cheek, or the figure its easy
girlish form, the hair appearance is the mirror of the age.
Stop for a moment and think of the really smart women that you
know; they do not allow those tell-tale grey hairs, the unmistakable symbol
of advancing years, to creep in and spoil their beauty. .
Grev hair can never be fashionable —it is the first sign of old age. A
man ma’v be as old as he feels—but a woman is as old as her hair.
Dr. Allen’s Mexican Walnut Stain has enjoyed the confidence of women
for 25 vears—it is perfectlv harmless, easy to apply, immediate in action,
and, above all, undetectable. Carefully carry out the instructions and let
it restore your hair to its natural shade. Grey hairs will vanish like magic
and youth will walk in at your door.

They laugh and talk; and all the while
Serenely there we sit and smile
As if we were whole-hearted too.
And if I chance to speak to you,
I have nothing more to say
Than anybody else there may;
And you from me with unconcern
To some other speaker turn,
As though you scarcely even heard
Each casual, ordinary word.
And so we play our careful parts.
Despite the treachery of our hearts,
And hardly seem to be aware
Of one another’s presence there.
But ’neath my false tranquillity
Upon your flushed throat I can see
The blood leap to the well-kissed place;
And as I watch your laughing face
Remembered sweetness makes it fair,
Or strangely burns amid your hair,
Slumbrous and deep. And far away
Beyond the shining of the day,
I know, as in some broken dream,
The starlight ruffling on a stream,
Dim water-noises and the sound
Of the wind walking on the ground.
And there, all secret and remote.
My mouth is warm upon your throat,
Or by your fingers soft-caressed
I lay my head beneath your breast,
All stars and kisses laid to rest.
Flooded by dim light from below
I see your eyes like deep pools glow;
And nothing comes to stir or break
The immortal silence that we make!

Pictures.
’Tis dawn of gold above the blue
Of windy waves and singing seas;
The dazzling beauty flashes through
The bending boughs of tossing trees.
The fishing fleet to meet the day
Is sailing out across the bay.
Above the plain the opal haze
Is shimmering. The breathless noon
Is glowing in a golden blaze
Of fiery splendor. The lagoon
Reflects the gum-trees white and slim,
The ibis drinking at the rim.
The river runs towards the west,.
And winds below the purple hill;
The sun is sinking down to rest
In skies of rose and daffodil.
Tranquillity and beauty blend
Above the hills and river bend.
The four white walls that compass me
Conceal the wondrous world outside.
But here are hills and sapphire sea.
The spacious windy plains and wide;
And wheresoe’er I turn my eyes
The dawn and moon and evening skies!

ETHEL MARTYR.
The Victors.
Splendid of mane went tlie lion forth in the
night;
And the tiger's rippling skin in the morning’s
light
Flashed a triumph of strength to the w r oods
and streams,
Where a man stood soft and white with his
waking dreams.
Yet he couched on the tiger's skin; and a
leopard slain
Was his pilloAv. filled with the hair of the
lion’s mane.
Terribly set the sun in the reddened wave,
And the hungry waters crashed on rock and
cave,
Drawing back with a snarl of hate to rise
and roar
Curses through spitting spray on the tortured
shore.
Yet he tamed the evil thing with a little
sail
And found a star far out beyond the gale.
“Death and death and death” was the bugle-
call *
Over the barren hills and the granite wall;
Opaline-grey, the desert with fiery breath
Answered the brazen cry with the whisper
“Death.”
Yet his was the laughter that touched the
wind with scorn.
Answering death with the yellow of ripening
corn !
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet beyond death and
doom,
In the moving front of his dreams was the
woman bloom
That lifted his heart to a madness of fire and
air
Till he set a of deeds in her golden hair,
Crowning her Princess of Stars and Queen
of the Sun
And Mother of Truth with all his hands had
won.
It is more marvel to me. as the delicate years
Prick the darkness with light of their unseen
spears,
How with laughter of soft-fleshed arms tliq
conquerors came
And broke the world in the future's holy
name,
Crying only : “Be glad. O women of ours !
We have given you Cod for joy and Ilis
footstool of flowers!”

Within her eyes that weeping turn to Heaven
There linger embers of a dying flame;
And while she bends and prays to be forgiven,
Her lips still quiver at a whispered name.

Drawn back to dream of Earth and love-lit
leas
By mem’ries of the sins of other days!

THE FIASCO OF GOVERNOR DE
CHAIR.
The new variety of Labor Government—the
one with the Red Objective and the complete
Moscow programme and a daily organ on
the directorate of which Premier Lang sits
in company with Garden, the Communist,
whom the Ministry professes to repudiate
with its whole soul—may have no great
record for large statesmanship, but in the
matter of party engineering it is a gifted
institution. Following on a number of minor
successes the surprise and apparently com-
plete capture of the N.S.W. Upper House
by the appointment of 25 new Labor mem-
bers was a startling event, which has no
parallel in Australian history. Certainly its
achievements would have been much more
brilliant but for the very inferior calibre of
the chief persons with whom it has had to
deal. To win points against George Fuller
was rather like taking down an infant with
a mining prospectus. Among other obvious
precautions, that torpid gentleman might
Lave at least tried to put the Upper House
on an elective footing after the manner of the
Senate, or he might have limited the number
of members, or he might have put in a num-
ber of Nationalist supporters to counter-
balance the horde of previous Labor nomi-
nees. He might also have abolished the
poisonous and undemocratic policy of filling
vacancies in the elective Chamber with
nominees. And he might have put on the
statute-book a knave-proof referendum law
to prevent astonishing coups d'etat being
sprung on the community by anything short
of armed violence. But Fuller let every
chance pass him. He was the absolutely fin-
ished ’bus-misser. In Governor De Chair the
Lang Ministry also found an “easy mark.”
That naval knight was educated on board
H.M.S. Britannia; joined the British fleet
at the age of 14; spent 45 years on the
frank, blue, open sea, save for some intervals
of duty ashore, mostly in sight of the same
unsuspicious and fish-bearing element. Be-
ing retired as a full admiral he was told to
try his hand at diplomacy and statesmanship.
And at the age of 61 he fell among a crowd
of Red Objectives with a Moscow training,
just as any elderly seafaring man might
come ashore and run into the society of
plausible characters with Uncles in Fiji.
* * * *
Two features of the case, were the .secrecy
of the negotiations and the sparkling sud-
denness of the denouement. If the coming
event had cast any perceptible shadow in
front of it, sufficient precedent and consti-
tutional law might have got into print to
show to even an inexperienced or simple-
minded marine Excellency that there were
more sides to the case than his jaunty
advisers cared to tell him. The beguilement
of the State figurehead seems to have been
or mostly left, to Attorney-General
Me Hern an, whose legal persuasiveness
would probably suit the emergency better
than the estate-agenty manner of Premier
Lang. The bones of the matter were that a
Government, professing to be Labor, desired
to swamp a House which was so largely
Labor already through previous appoint-
ments that no extensive swamping should
have been required. That is to say, it
shouldn’t have been required unless tiie Red
or Moscow brand of Laborism was something
strange and new. The additional votes were
wanted chiefly to carry measures which were
not on the programme that Premier Lang
put before the electors, though they might
be on the Red end of the party document
which was sedulously kept in the background.
Prominent was a measure for the promotion
of certain public servants who tried to hold
up the country in anti-Allied interests dur-
ing the darkest, period of the war in which
the Governor himself took a hand with dis-
tinction ; the reduction of certain public
servants who didn’t join in the hold-up; and
the abolition of five unions whose members
had declined to join. The policy of the
Lang Government is that a worker must
belong to a union or starve, and when these
loyalists ceased to belong through the dis-
appearance of their unions it was presumably
meant that they should starve unless their
opponents chose to take them in. The idea
of disqualification by sudden law instead of
by legal process suggested the obsolete Bill
of Attainder method, under which the party
in power beheaded its enemy by Act of
Parliament when it couldn’t prove anything
against him in a court. A great deal has
been made of the statement that every Labor
Government has a mandate to abolish the
Upper House whether the sanction of the
people is asked during an election or not,
because abolition has a chronic place on the
party programme, and has grown mouldy
there. Having a chronic mandate it is sup-
posed to have a chronic right to swamp a
nominee Chamber with members who will
vote for its abolition if asked, which they
possibly won’t be. As a matter of fact, the
referendum, initiative and recall are sup-
posed to come in as substitutes when the
Upper House goes, yet nobody proposes that
they should come in. To the new brand
of Labor the referendum is an abomination.
They don’t have it at Moscow.
* * * *
If the N.S.W. State Governor had been
a diplomatist, or even a man moderately
experienced in public affairs, he might, when
an unexpected crisis was sprung on him,
have given the people the benefit of the doubt.
Instead of tamely surrendering he might
have suggested submitting the . dispute to
arbitration, and, fortified by the result of the
very recent Federal election, have offered the
Lang Government a dissolution, so that it
might get an intelligible mandate,: if the com-
munity cared to give one. It bas been dis-
closed that his Excellency made the 25
appointments only “under strong protest,”
also that he “strongly resisted.” There is no
visible evidence of the strong resistance—no
visible evidence that he showed a grip of the
situation or offered alternatives; no evidence
of anything but suggestions of compromise
followed by a weak surrender. He was
apparently under no pressure save the voices
of McTiernan and Lang, for the British
Government took no visible hand in the mat-
ter; merely the drip of the declamation of
these two wore away his capacity for resist-
ance.
* * * *
By reason of truculence on one side and
inexperience on the other, self-government in
N. S. Wales has gone into a state of prac-
tical suspense. There is a Ministry which
takes its instructions from outside Parlia-
ment, which smothers debate, and which
assumes the right to disrate Judges and civil
servants, and to reduce to the status of black-
legs those unionists who failed to break the
law. Until the other day it smothered com-
ment only in the Assembly; the surrender of
Governor De Chair should now enable it to
do so in both Houses. If the result has not
been quite achieved it is to be assumed that
more surrender will follow. The people are
not allowed to express their opinion of the
Ministry’s policy at by-elections, for these
have been suspended. It would require some
audacity to suspend the general elections
also ; but the Septennial Act is a sort of
British precedent, and the Red Objective
party certainly doesn’t lack audacity. What-
ever it does, in that direction or any other,
will presumably be assented to. Maybe
there will be a “protest” ; but protests don’t
hurt. Nor, unfortunately, do they save
those who never needed saving as badly as
they do at this moment.
WHIZZ!
The ordered course of the centuries weaves
a definite pattern on the loom of human life.
Fancies, imaginations, fears, hopes, despairs
and enthusiasms all go to a progress marked
by equally definite w T ebs of united thought.
The fourteenth century was the age of faith
-•—blind faith, perhaps, but with enough sight
to build the great cathedrals. The fifteenth
century, breaking with faith, took
up the idea of discovery. While the Portu-
guese were finding Africa and re-finding Asia
the first printers were setting up their crazy
presses and men were looking on dusty
shelves for the lost wonder of Roman and
Greek culture. Before the century closed
Columbus had stumbled upon America and
duplicated the world. As a natural result
of the years of discovery the sixteenth
century became the age of adventure.
Luther, Calvin and Henry VIII. found
it in the religious sphere; Marlowe and
Shakspeake in the drama; and all the
merry cut-throat gentlemen of England and
Spain sought it where hard blows were given
and great treasure gained in new lands of
mystery. The seventeenth century ran to
logic and mathematics. Even religion tried
to argue about the exact nnjnber of the elect.
The eighteenth century made chemistry its
watchword. Practical experiment was the
order of the day; and political elements in
strange combination caused the huge explo-
sion of the French Revolution. After
chemistry came mechanics —the key idea of
the nineteenth century. Its thrones and wars
were nearly as mechanical as its railway-
engines ; it discovered a theory of evolution
and taught it as a wholly mechanical system.
Life itself became largely mechanical —easier
in some respects, more difficult in others;
but always bound to keep its relationship
to the wheels.
* * * *
A quarter of the twentieth century has
now slipped away; and it is possible to give
it its clear place in the procession of the
centuries. Our line of progress naturally
springs from that of the nineteenth century,
and all the mechanical advances of that
period have been carried on into our own.
Our own distinctive note is speed. The
cars that fly along the open road, the soaring
aeroplane and airship, the wireless flash of
thought from land to land are all indica-
tions of the trend of our thought. Crowds
flock to see a machine driven at a furious
pace round a circular track, though the man
element in the race only relates to nerve
and courage, and the force making the
wheels spin is purely mechanical. The fact
that the struggle between rival machines is
really fought out in the workshop—and a
foreign workshop at that —rather than on the
track does not in the least diminish the
interest in the performance. The man who
owns a car generally speaks of it first in
terms of the speed at which he can make
it run; and this although he has never any
real need for such fast travelling. Similarly,
every improvement in aeroplane or airship
is reported in relation to speed. The marvel
of 120 miles an hour has given place to
threats of 250, and there is still no limit to
the imagined rate at which mechanical wings
may bear their living load from land to
land. Speed of transit is, however, a slow
thing compared with the speed of transmitted
words; speech is heard thousands of miles
away at a time which, according to the time-
piece, is hours before it is uttered. Philo-
sophy is, in fact, lost for terms in which to
describe its new speed experiences. The
advances are of such a nature that there is
something almost cosmic about them. Com-
parison is no longer possible with the flight
of birds, arrows or swift-running horses and
deer. It is necessary to go to worlds and
suns whirling through space to get anything
like an adequate parallel for the speed of
transmitted thought.
* * * *
A world stocktaking at the close of 1925
seems to show art, literature and all the
finer eternal things of the mind on a very
small shelf; religion a precious little parcel
laid away in a strong safe; politics and
international relations occupying a dusty
and untidy counter; industry, labor and
social science in one busy corner; and speed
filling up nearly the whole space in the big
department-store of ideas. Following up the
notion of a definite thought pattern for the
succeeding ages, it is not easy to see what
may naturally follow the deification of
speed. We are being brought very much
closer together; distances are wiped out and
boundaries of prejudice and custom are
obliterated. Though all is in a sense
mechanical, the world movement seems to
transcend the bounds of mechanics. Some
have seen in this a trend towards what may
be called for want of a betten term spiritual
force. Behind all that some ancient religions
and a good many modern cranks have taken
for granted or reached by arguments based
on a boiling together of unexplained pheno-
mena and a huge body of superstition, there
seem to be some small grains of fact upon
which new and practical thinking may be
built. Telepathy, though not general nor of
frequent occurrence, appears to have an
existence beyond all dispute; and if a human
being can transmit his thought without
mechanical aid to another human being at a
distance, there would seem to be a possi-
bility of man being entirely free from the
bonds of time and space, if not actually
from the bonds of matter also. Telepathy
in its infrequent manifestations offers a lot
of food for thought. It may even have an
unknown mechanical basis and be governed
by perfectly natural and discoverable laws:
but that does not alter the human possibili-
ties to which it points. Without postulating
spirit at all or maintaining that life has any
existence apart from the body—and also, of
course, without denying it—it is possible to
see huge advances upon spiritual lines.
Human beings influence one another without
action or speech; the mere sympathy of an
audience will lift an oratof to he
cannot attain without that audience. In
the swift drawing together of all humanity
it would seem perfectly reasonable to sup-
pose that a new power may be generated of
which the past had only vague dreams. In
a word, the big future may take up the run-
ning from the age of speed by plunging into
the grand adventure of creating a spirit
world of its own. The poor ghosts that rap
tables and allow themselves to be photo-
graphed by Conan Doyle in antiquated
nightshirts could have little enough part in
such an adventure, nor does it follow that
the very useful and pleasant arrangement
we call the body need be in any way got rid
of; but in the union of minds—possibly a
perfectly mechanical union—man may yet
find his real driving force. As an end-of-the-
year speculation such a line of thought is at
least legitimate.
LITTLE COOGEE.
The mist of years rolls away, and sights
which have vanished from the face of Syd-
ney come back to memory. In Newtown,
now a slummy wilderness of brick and stone,
there was no more than 40 years ago a green
expanse where, under drooping gums, meet-
ings used to be held. One though he be not
yet past middle-age recalls Arncliffe as a far-
out bush suburb where the double-line rail-
way system ceased; orchards, beautiful in
spring-time and autumn, lay on either side
of the railway beyond Petersham; North
Sydney had a cable-tram running to the
height on which its park now stands among
streets of prosaic suburban residences and
shops—beyond was busliland, with a ramb-
ling ribbon of military road, the rough sur-
face of it studded with red antheaps.
Manly was a little village reached by paddle-
steamers, and coaches rattled along bush
tracks to Narrabeen, Newport and Pittwater,
each a few primitive habitations and a name.
1 larling Point, though beginning to be settled
by people for whom Potts Point had ceased
to be exclusive enough, was mostly bush;
Bellevue Hill and Kensington were fine
places to gather “five-corners” and wild
flowers; the Allens’ glebe lands, adjoining
their Toxteth Hall ( now a convent), were
coming into the market only a quarter of a
century ago. From the post-and-rail fence
along Petersham-road there was a vista of un-
broken paddocks looking over to the main
suburban line.
And what memories cluster about Little
Coogee! On Sundays the shores of its long
finger of bay are now crowded with pic-
nickers, whose heaps of clothes and parapher-
nalia combine with the long dressing-sheds
to give the place an untidy appearance. In
other days it was a secluded and delightful
spot. The frequenters of the bay, maintain-
ing that “vees” were all-sufficient, had an
unending argument with authority upon the
matter of bathing-costume; and when the
cry of “Trap!” was raised (even that name
for John Hop is already forgotten) there
was a scatter of the semi-nude with their
clothes over their arms. Cricket was played
on “The Flat,” now recognisable only by its
distance from the cemetery at the top of
the hill and the even height of the cottages
which cover it. Aromatic pine-needles
matted the unmade footpaths in Arden-street,
then the one road-connection between Waver-
ley and Coogee. Nowadays Arden-street
seems lost in masses of brick and masonry
and the network of streets striking off from
it. In the tide of progress an old house
known as Somebody’s Folly, because the am-
bitious citizen who began it found himself
unable to complete the mansion of his dreams,
has been engulfed. Gone are the ’possum-
haunted trees; a strange old lady who kept
eight dogs, eleven cats and twenty-odd cages
of birds in a pleasant dwelling with eaves
abutting on the back garden—a delightful
playground for children; Bustard, the in-
ventor, who did many clever things but
mainly did them wrong (the few he did right
brought him a sufficient income until he broke
his heart trying to induce the City Council
to adopt a patent garbage-destructor) ; and
the glories of Bishopscourt, once a forest of
enchantment to adventurous boyhood. Here
were ferns, the murmuring of innumerable
bees, locusts in full variety—and snakes.
Now. with the exception of a patch or two
of Bishopscourt, destitute of timber except
survey-pegs and land-agents’ signboards, an
avalanche of bricks and mortar and cement
has swept over the land. Not only bunga-
lows, but flats are everywhere, just as they
are around the north headland of Coogee,
where the long-gone Baden Baden Hotel
once drew the revellers of Sydney. The “flat”
children bathe in the congested swimming-
pool that used to be Little Coogee Bay,
knowing nothing of a time when the whole
place was a veritable paradise for the young
of the species.
There is something nightmarish about
the way in which the growth of Sydney
has overwhelmed green spaces, obliterated
the charming works of nature. Like head-
stones upon the graves of old liberties are
the flats of Little Coogee. And the trans-
formation will go on until some real effort
is made to divert the tide to other centres
where it is desirable that cities shoul-Jomnv.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Australia’s Old Sarums.
The Vic. Coalition Government lias shelved
the latest of numerous half-hearted proposals
for redistributing the Leg. Assembly seats.
The present distribution dates from 1903,
and the longer it lasts the worse it looks.
At the 1924 general election Boroondara
(63,127 electors), Jika Jika (41,548),
Essendon (37.039), St. Kilda (35,932),
Hawthorn (32,143), Grenville (4256),
Ovens (4480), Warrenheip (5192), Allan
dale (5216) and Eaglehawk (5861) each
returned one member. These disparities have
grown more shocking during the life-
time of the present Parliament; at
latest advices suburban Boroondara had
71,797 electors and rural Grenville 4233.
The Government’s idea was to appoint com-
missioners to prepare a plan retaining 65
Assembly seats, but giving the metropolis
24 (three more than at present) and urban
and country districts the other 41. The
Commissioners were to fix quotas of approxi-
mately 21,500, 15,000 and 10,000 for metro-
politan, urban and country electorates res-
pectively, but were to be allowed a margin
of one-fifth more or less. This would, of
course, have been more tolerable than the
present grotesque arrangement, but at best
it would have been only a makeshift, and in
any case it has been dropped. Incredible as
it seems, the Westralian distribution is even
more flagrant than the Victorian. In
Collier's State, suburban Canning (14,051


electors), Leederville (11,630) -and Subiaco
(10 470'i have the same number ot members
as Cue (571), Mount Margaret (470) and
Menzies (324), all decayed mining camps
with as many goats as people. Lius sorry
scheme was furiously opposed by the Labor
party when brought in 14 years ago out
at the last election it was the means ot tne
same party being returned to office a
minority of votes, and although nearly two
years have gone by there has been no
attempt to alter it. In Queensland the
electoral districts have been so artistically
cut up that a party in a minority of 20,000
votes secured a majority of four seats; and
even in N. S. Wales, under proportional
representation, a party 17,250 votes to the
bad came back two seats to the good. A
vast amount of logrolling and gerrymandering
would disappear if the States adopted the
Commonwealth system, under which a quota
is struck in each of the six constituent parts,
with a permissible variation ol: one-fiftli more
or less, boundaries being rearranged when the
need occurs. There are no complaints about
the Commonwealth system, nor any suspicion
of gerrymandering, and the Commonwealth
Commissioners could be depended upon to
make a decent job of fixing the boundaries of
State electorates, according to whether single
or multiple electorates were required, although
they might well be allowed a wider margin
than one-fifth in dealing with remote dis-
tricts like the outlying parts of Westralia,
Queensland and South Aus., Western N. S.
Wales and the Vic. Malice, which must have
their local representatives in the State Par-
liament. And. if the redistribution business
were handed over to the Commonwealth
officials who perform their own task so ably,
it would be impossible to find excuses for
the expensive tomfoolery of maintaining two
departments to enrol the same electors. But
in these matters State politicians are the
most inveterate of Tories. While clinging
stubbornly to the double enrolment farce
in the name of State Rights, they, support
any electoral distribution or device that
gives their side an advantage, however un-
fair, and exhibit the greatest reluctance to
separate a legislator who lives on the game
from his Old Sarum. And the manoeuvres
of the Cockies in Victoria, of the Liberals in
South Aus., and of the Laborites in West-
ralia, Queensland and N. S. Wales (where
the Lang Government wants to restore the
first-past-the-post swindle because, as Col.
Sec. Lazzarini argues, it is good enough for
Conservative Britain) show that there is
nothing to choose between one set of poli-
ticians and another. They are all tarred
with the same brush.

The Hothouse of Protection.
When the' imposing visitor comes this way
he is taken in hand by the proper depart-
ment, presumably the Tripe and Tourist
Bureau, and “put wise” to the situation.
It is impressed on him that the Australian’s
vanity is incredible, that his capacity for
assimilating flattery has no ascertained limit
and that he doesn’t resent being fooled.
Wherefore the stranger within our gates has
a habit of stating, as he leaves the said
gates, that he has been astonished beyond
expression at the wonderful natural re-
sources of the country, and that he has never
seen or imagined anything to equal the pro-
gress of settlement —settlement which he
very likely hasn't troubled to look at beyond
tiie confines of the big cities. Then he
grinds the stereotyped axe by stating that
with these unparalleled resources the obvi-
ous destiny of this land is to grow cheap
food for Britain and buy expensive manufac-
tured goods from Britain, and that any
attempt to depart from strict clodhopping
will be folly, and must end in failure. One
who lately overdid the leg-pulling was Major
John Jacob Astor, of London Times, who
came this way with the Press Union party.
Being lunched in London on his return he
scattered these pearls
Australia, was larger than the United States, its
potentialities were greater, and its resources were
probably not inferior.... Australia appeared from a
distance to be suffering from chronic political and
industrial disturbances, but while he admitted that
these disturbances did not conduce to the country’s
develoument he declined to be pessimistic. Aus-
tralia’s history demonstrated that commonsense had
always ultimately prevailed. He commended the
White Australia policy, and Australia’s ambition to
establish secondary industries, but he hoped that the
effort to force industries in the hothouse of Protection
would not carry them too far.
Now, Australia knows something about its
potentialities and resources, and the other
familiar things. They would be more equal
to those of the United States if Australia
possessed 2(1,410 miles of river, permanently
navigable for vessels of some size, as me
TJ.S. is said to do; if it had a liberal cata-
logue of mountains, many of them 14,000 ft.
or more in height; a few hundreds or thou-
sands more fresh-water lakes, including some
of the world’s best samples; and a few
sundries. Lacking these assets, it may be
well advised to keep its business eye glued on
the “hothouse of Protection” as the United
States has done, and take the chance of
carrying that structure too far. It can
always be carried back again, should retreat
appear necessary. Australia can get as high
a tariff as Uncle Sam, even if it can’t acquire
as high a mountain-range. It is always
pleasant to know that the White Australia
policy is approved of in important quarters,
but there is a chance that the approval may
be partly based on the hope that it will
keep wages high enough to make manufac-
turing competition difficult. Some isolated
features of the agricultural situation are
not encouraging at the moment. The Mur-
rumbidgee (N.S.W.) irrigation settlement is
reported to have lost £285,258 during last
year, and the accumulated loss is £2,760,421,
which is a very large sum per acre: also
the tale about abandoned farms and ab-
sconded settlers becomes much too frequent.
The N.S.W. wheat industry was indirectly
subsidised in the same year to the extent
of £1,750.000 or so, by carriage on the rail-
ways at less than cost. The sugar surplus
lias to be sold abroad at a heavy loss. The
export of so much raw materials, some i f
which might be used here, and the import
of so much manufactured goods, most of
which might be made here, is a matter of
ships, and while J. Bull makes a heap of
money -in normal- times by., hiring out the
ships, Australia pays a heap of money, and
is so much worried by Walsiies and others,
mostly from Bull’s country, that it would
be glad if it could do without ships.

The Badly-used Marine Officer.
Dear Bulletin, —In “The Bridge that is
Liable to Break'’ (B. 10/12/'25) appears this
text: “To-day the skipper and the first
engineer are generally quite as good grum-
blers as the rank and file of the crew.” And
there is good reason for it, too. No employer
has had such loyal service as the shipowner
lias received from masters and mates. It
has been a personal loyalty to the ship, and
the shipowner has taken full advantage of
it. Kipling’s
The game is more than the player
And the ship is more than the crew
was the idea driven into the boy as soon
as he went on board a ship, and he usually
started early. The tradition carried on. to
the engineers until quite lately; but it’s
getting fainter. We worked all hours with-
out overtime long after the flatfeet were
paid, and we got no thanks or considera-
tion. Except for the misguided attempt in
1890, we never struck on this coast. At long
last the Arbitration Act and a certain
amount of cohesion among ourselves made
it possible to ventilate our conditions. The
owners put every obstacle in our way that
legal trickery was capable of, and The
Bulletin was the only paper that gave a
fair statement of our case. Very grudgingly
some of our claims were granted, but every
effort was m;a.e to whittle away the advan-
tage we had gained. The margin for skill
paid above the basic wage is ridiculously low.
Overtime was to be paid, and at once much
of the work that had been absolutely in-
dispensable was found to be no longer neces-
sary. Where payment could not be altogether
avoided, it was questioned, “reserved for
consideration” and “deferred” until some
began to get sick of trying to collect it and
others were frightened out of demanding it.
That position holds until now. If a mate
questions a sailor’s overtime, a union official
is up at the office right away. It is usually
paid, even though not due, because otherwise
the ship might be held up. We are afbitra-
tionists and want a fair deal. However
much the awards have fallen short of what
we consider our due, we have carried on
loyally under them. On one occasion we
were kept out of the Arbitration Court for
two years after an award had lapsed, being
asked <to forego our turn because more mili-
tant unions were threatening strike. We
were practically assured that the new award
when made would be retrospective. Even
the shipowners expected it would be. When
it came to the point, a crack was found in
the Act, and our two years’ increase of pay
fell into it. The shipowner has gone out of
liis way to show us that the militant attitude
is the only one he pays attention to. Is it
to be wondered that we are developing into
grumblers?—Yours, Mate.
A New Way to Increase Old Debts.
The three States which abut on the Murray
—N. S. Wales, Victoria and , S, Australia —
spent, up to June, 1924, £52,430,000 of loan-
money on the repurchase of land for settle-
ment ; and a considerable amount of the
settlement was done in what is described as
“the Murray Valley”— a very large, flat
region, with the Darling, Murray, Murrum-
bidgee, eto, contorting themselves in the
midst. A project is now mooted, in papers
which believe in big loans, the importation
of manufactured goods and a life-and-death
struggle to export vegetables in competition
with the ryot, the fellah and the rnujik, that
what the case calls for is not so much a
cleaning up of the old mess as another
financial plunge which will make the pre-
vious “settlement” racket look pale and
washed out. The proposal is to make the
Murray mouth deep enough for big vessels,
and to fit the long, curly Trickle for deep-
sea commerce, so that the settler may view
great ships passing in their pride and be
cheered and enriched thereby. The river is
thus to fulfil its manifest destiny, or some-
thing. Possibly, despite a certain uncer-
tainty of rainfall, it might be turned into
an artificial Mississippi with, unlimited ex-
pense ; but the U.S. has a natural Missis-
sippi and yet seems to find it more profitable
to depend on railways. Still the Common-
wealth Government, with its capacity for
attending to every job save its own, may be
attracted away from its long-overdue trans-
continental railway contract to toy with the
idea of bringing ocean liners into liiverina.
Such an opportunity of throwing good, loans
after bad doesn’t present itself every day.

Literature in the Schools.
A deputation from the authors’ section 6f
the Australian Journalists’ Association
waited upon N.S.W. Minister of Education
Mutch and asked him to put more reading
by Australian authors into the public schools.
The Minister replied that it had always been
his policy to give the children as much of
the matter asked for as possible, but he could
not forget that education demanded the best,
wherever it might be produced. A con-
ference with departmental officers, however,
is promised, and thus the whole field is left
open. The Minister touched the real point
when he insisted that quality rather than
place of origin is the thing desired; but much
depends upon those who are the judges of
quality. At present a great deal of stuff
of inferior literary value and of foreign
origin is placed before the children, and
Australian writers who make no claim to
genius or first rank in the world of letters
may fairly claim that their work would be
a good deal better for any educational pur-
pose than much of the matter actually used.
Recently an absurd American tale in the
vernacular of an illiterate countryside was
printed in the N. S. Wales school paper—
a glaring instance of the lack of taste and
knowledge on the part of some official. The
influence of the American moving-pictures
degrades speech even more than it does pub-
lic morals and manners. Very rarely are
the words thrown on the screen written in
decent English; and the advertisements are
a worse pollution. That an Education De-
partment should spend public money to aid
and abet this sort of thing is shameful.
Where certain Australian authors have a
particular claim, for recoguition is in the
matter of local information. When facts
about Australia are presented by Australian
writers in good and simple English the fullest
use should be made of them. Such writing
is in its class the very best; and the very
best is the thing to be aimed at. But the
selection is the difficult matter. When Eng-
lish ceased to be a compulsory subject with
students iu training for teaching the young,
the N. S. Wales Department seemed to
emphasise its contempt for letters. The
Minister may be altogether iu earnest in
his desire to give the best; a conference be-
tween authors and the Department may be
conducted in the finest possible spirit; but
when the best possible is put in the hands
of a teacher who does not know it as the
best, and has no trained appreciation of its
beauty or force, it is difficult to see how
much progress can be made.
*
Law and the Forgiveness of Sins.
The forgiveness of sins is a virtue which
has its limitations. Practised indifferently,
it becomes the fertile cause of further sin-
ning. The Crimes Acts of various States
make provision for first offenders. They had
in view certain cases with exceptional cir-
cumstances, and clemency was to be an
unusual, not a usual, feature of the proceed-
ings. Unfortunately the practice in many
courts of criminal and police jurisdiction has
been to extend this concession into a broad
rule that every citizen is at liberty to com-
mit at least one offence with impunity. Side
by side with this statutory provision has
arisen an increasing practice in the Courts
of Quarter Sessions —and now apparently
also in the Courts of Petty Sessions, though
on what authority it is difficult, to say—to
extend this forgiveness of sins to more or
less hardened sinners by releasing them on
recognisance—it may be their own—to come
up for sentence when called upon. The
customary thing with the offender who has
a long list of convictions is to put in the
plea of '‘never had a chance.” He pitches
a tale of woe in which he figures as the
victim of long and persistent liounding-down
by the police, and his Honor or his Worship
whose sympathies incline him to the side
of rescuing from crime rather than to that
of the protection of society finds an easy
way out for the poor, persecuted criminal.
The law-abiding citizen has to pay the
price in the weakened security given to
his life and property and the diminished
protection of his wife and daughters. The
Judges and magistrates who-incline toward
an irrational exercise of mercy are well
known to the criminal class; and what
that class is capable when unre-
strained by law the incidents of the police
strike in Melbourne showed. The real
strength behind all criminal law is that pun-
ishment should be certain and unavoidable.
That is the power that informs all natural
law, and the nearer the human article gets
to it the less crime we shall have. A recent
question in the N.S.W. Leg. Assembly re-
ferring to certain cases before a stipendiary
magistrate brings the question again into
public view. “It is time something was done
about it,” suggested the Leader of tin* Oppo-
sition ; and the Minister of Justice promised
that lie would look into it. If looking into
it means merely that certain official reports
will be called for and certain departmental
minutes inscribed on them, then the business
will be just a futile matter of routine. What
is needed, since experience shows that not
all Judges and magistrates are wise in the
exercise of their discretion, is that some
review of their acts in this direction by a
higher judicial tribunal should be provided
for. It should not be in the unchecked
power of any Judge or magistrate to fet
loose upon the community a pack of crim-
inals to raven on it for no better reason
than that they may some day repent of their
kins.
*
Tho Fruit Trade.
The outcry in London about arsenic in con-
signments of apples from overseas is a seri-
ous enough matter to make Australia do
some hard thinking. Apples are to be con-
demned if one-tenth of a grain of the poison
be found in a pound of fruit; and if oue-
hundredtli of a grain be found in a pound a
search will be made through the whole , con-
signment in case any part of it should con-
tain the larger amount. The senior medical
officer to the British Ministry of Health
called attention to an Australian advertise-
ment of a brand of arsenate of lead that
“would not wash off,”-sothat, although Aus-
tralian consignments have not yet come un-
der direct suspicion, an ugly warning has
already been thrown our way. It is not
alone the actual' condemnation of cargoes
that we have to fear; easily-created preju-
dice in the mind of the British consumer
would be almost as, damaging. We must,
therefore, choose our steps with great care.
As matters stand iii at least one State an
inspector can order fruit-trees to be sprayed
with arsenate, of lead,. even when the crop is
on the trees; and in at least one district a
small epidemic broke out this season which
tne local medical man diagnosed as mild
arsenical poisoning from eating apricots
which had beetr.so sprayed. The whole
matter demands immediate and very serious
consideration. In the opinion of many suc-
cessful orchardists there are sprays of
a non-poisonous kind which are equally
effective in keeping down pests sprays
which could be safely used at any stage of
growth. In addition to this, there is the
important point that arsenic in any form
is injurious to plant-life, and that it remains
in the soil permanently. One spraying with
arsenate of lead at the usual strength of the
mixture will have little effect on the produc-
tiveness of the land; but when the dose is re-
peated twice a year or more over a number of
seasons real injury is being wrought. The
general idea that old orchard land is of little
value for any other sort of cultivation is
probably based on the fact that such land
has been completely poisoned, and may b§
incapable of bearing more than a meagre
sward of poor grass for a century to come.
Certainly land which is now being continu-
ally dosed with arsenic will not continue
for long to give satisfactory results. So
there is much against the use of this form
of spraying from the point of view of the
future of the State as well as from that of
consumers.
Yes We Have No Population.
“A.S.”: All too often the casual Australian,
when approached with a suggestion to ex-
pand business, pleads that there is not
enough population to warrant exertion and
outlay. Numerous examples, however, of
outsiders coming in and operating for profit
are to hand, and the tribe increases. None
should cavil at them; the immigrant who
can beat the man on the spot has all honor
coming to him. The yellow taxis in Sydney
are a case in point. With their advent the
number of taxis on the road has more than
doubled, to serve the population that, accord-
ing to the do-nothings, is not thick enough
to call for enterprise. Moreover, the new-
comer, by advertising, is instilling a taste
for taxi-travelling into the allegedly non-
existent public. Suggest to the Australian to
advertise, and he asseverates that there is
no population to advertise to. Make men-
tion of American advertising, and he will
expatiate on America’s teeming millions. Tell
him that California has sparse population,
and he will fall back on Chicago and Mil-
waukee. Explain that it was not always so,
and that much of that population is low-
grade and foreign, also that other centres
mean also more competition, and he retreats
back to the old stand, Yes We Have No
Population, and intimates that one is deal-
ing only in theories. We see America, with
its teeming millions, attracting Australian
workers, while Australia, with no population,
fails to attract American workers. Ambitious
youth nowadays itches to sample America,
and not London as heretofore. Life attracts
life. Enterprise is an attitude of mind and
not a matter of condition. When the Aus-
tralian finds his home market overfilled with
home products, and it is impossible to stimu-
late local buying capacity, there is the
American market close at hand. Wliat about
passion-fruit? Of course, there is the
American tariff. But the American encoun-
ters the Australian tariff; and at the moment
it is not Australian products that are over-
filling the Australian market. There seems
to be need of a compulsory course in the
Macßo bert sox book, “A Young Man and
a Nailcan,” although it may be necessary
to form a Nailcan Union in order to get
the legislation. Following that there should
be a course in Herbert Hoover’s “Indi-
vidualism.”

The Decadience of France.
From an Australian journalist in Paris:
Paris; the most cosmopolitan city in the world,
has taken the black man to its bosom. The fashion
in the theatres this season is to introduce the nigger
as the hero and the centre of the spotlight. At
the present moment there is running at the Theatre
ties Champs-Elysees, in the most fashionable and
exclusive quarter of the city, “La Revue Nog-re,” in
which 35 negroes play all the main parts. The
Chatelet, the Drury-lane of Paris, has just finished
a long run of a spectacular show about the black race.
The Folies-Bergeres are featuring one of the most
blasphemous scenes ever shown on any stage, in
whifeh a Black Mass is celebrated'in mediaeval fashion
as a. burlesque on “Faust.” The Devil is played by
a huge negro, who receives all the applause, and is
the only member of the cast allowed to take the
call. In another “tableau” in the same show a
very inadequately attired white woman is shown
succumbing to the charms of a big buck, while a
chorus of undressed niggers sits round and hammers
tom-toms. American jazz songs are rendered in half
a dozen other theatres, and there are countless
colored orchestras in the fashionable and expensive
restaurants and cabarets.
Not only on the stage are the blacks in evidence.
One constantly sees them on the boulevards, par-
ticularly in Montmartre, generally with white girls
hanging on their arms. They own cars and drive
them. . Even the polyglot population of taxi-drivers ■
has its black quota. They live where they like, eat
where they like (served by white waiters) and mingle
with whom they like. The weedy, Oxford-bagged,
yellow, ultra-fashionable Hindu, so often encountered
in London, looks strange to Australian eyes. But
Paris is much worse. Americans who swarm here
in the summer are stricken with amazement, for
the States do keep the nigger in his place.
Of course the explanation is easy. The country
has no colored problem within its own frontiers, and
the troops recruited from the black colonies are
to-day the mainstay of the army. The campaigns in
both Syria and Morocco are being fought with more
black troops than white. The Senegalese are par-
ticularly useful; they are even garrisoned in fair
numbers in the Paris barracks and forts. The
average Frenchman regards all foreigners in the
same light, and feels no inclination to differentiate
between the blacks and the 3,000,000 Poles, Italians
and Anglo-Saxon races domiciled in France. He
belongs to a race fine in many ways, but pray
Heaven that Australia never attempts to copy him !
.John Bull’s Unhappy New Year.
Britain undertook to subsidise the local
coal industry for another nine months in
order to stave off the threatened general
strike till the Government had time to turn
round. The period is nearly up, and subsidy
moxiey is going out at the rate of £28,000,000
a year. The Chancellor of the Exchequer
says that, though it has helped to keep the
surviving pits open, it Inis done nothing to-
wards re-opening those which had closed, and
that the miners who used to work in the
latter are living on the dole, and willing to
stay there. He added gloomily that there
are too many miners in the British Isles;
that they turn out too much coal, so that a
vast quantity has to be sent abroad; that it
has to be sold abroad at less than the cost
of production, for otherwise it wouldn’t sell
at all; and that there is something weird and
wild about paying the loss out of British
taxes, so that the foreign manufacturer may
get British coal cheap and be better able
to undersell the British manufacturer. A
Protectionist tariff to prevent the importa-
tion of coal wouldn’t help, for coal isn’t
imported, but a tariff to prevent the importa-
tion of many other things should aid materi-
ally. The re-establishment of a multitude
of coal-using industries inside Britain would
be a boon and a blessing to harassed J. Bull.
One difficulty in the case is that the British
coal-digger works only 42 hours per week,
and that he demands the war wages of 1921,
though the war prices of that time have gone
where the bad devils go. Further, Britain,
with its gigantic system of pensioning the
w.orkless instead of finding them work, has
become a rather casual place. The drink bill
was set down, in 1924, at £317,500,000, or
about 11s. per week for a family of four. It

has been calculated by serious-minded men of
figures that there is hardly a British miner’s
home where the expenditure on moving-
picture shows is less than Bs. a week. And
the passion for backing the wrong horse has
reached such intensity in the Cold Country
that the sum spent on the undesirable animal
was lately alleged, by the Inland Revenue
Department, to be £417,000,000 per annum.
It bases its estimate on the aggregate booky
income-tax returns, and they are probably
cut pretty short. The latest estimate was
£500,000,000. There is plenty of food for
thought in the British Isles, even if other
victuals have to be imported.

Upper House Appointments.
A good deal of alleged precedent has been
paraded in defence of Governor De Chair’s
action in appointing 25 Labor partisans to
the N.S.W. Upper House, but the circum-
stances are so remarkable that nothing shows
the slightest sign of fitting the case. One
story that has been quoted was the famous
Maoriland case of Ballance v. Onslow’
and Glasgow. The outgoing Ministry had
been allowed to fill up the House of Nomi-
nees (not life, but seven-year nominees) to
the habitual limit. The new Ministry, re-
representing a new party, found that it had
hardly any representatives in the Council.
In that respect it differed wholly from Lang
and Co., for N.B.W. Labor has been in office
off and on since 1910, and had appointed
stacks of followers. Ballance, with his big
elected majority, asked for 12 appointments
to help in carrying out Iris electoral pro-
gramme. Lang, with his small majority,
asked for 25, and announced, immediately he
had got them, that he might demand more,
the object being to effect something (aboli-
tion of the Second Chamber) which was
not put on the election programme, though
it might have mouldered indefinitely on tin:
party platform. Ballance, despite his obvi-
ous mandate, had his very moderate request
refused by Governor Onslow and by Acting-
Governor Prendergast, but the British Gov-
ernment instructed Governor Glasgoav to
give way. It apparently didn’t direct Gov-
ernor De Chair to give way. The Queens-
land case of Governor Musgrave and
Mcllwraith and Benjamin Kitt and the
stolen boots helps Lang and De Chair even
less. Kitt was a first offender, sentenced
to three years for £2 worth of boots. Mus-
grave refused to admit him to probation,
saying that the Cabinet had no right to
interfere in such matters. His Excellency,
after parting with Mcllwraith over this
matter, had to take him back, because no
other leader cared to inherit the fight, even
with the promise of a dissolution if he
couldn’t carry on otherwise. The case was
different from that of Lang’s Governor, for
Bavin was an alternative Premier in that
instance, and at a fresh election he
might have swept the country. Queens-
land supplied a greater and more re-
cent precedent. Four times in the Ryan-
Tiieodore period (from 1915 onward) bills
for the abolition of the Chamber of Nominees
were passed by the Assembly, but Governors
turned a deaf ear to all propositions of
their advisers to swamp the recalcitrant in-
stitution. They steadily pointed out that,
under State law, the Referendum could be
invoked after, two disagreements, and de-
clined to budge. Reluctantly the Ministry
took a popular vote (in 1917), and the
people gave 62,909 majority for the reten-
tion of the Council (for abolition, 116,196,
and against, 179,105). But later there was
a hiatus between Governors, and the Minis-
try made Bill Lennon, a solid Labor mem-
ber, Lieutenant-Governor. The Leg. Coun-
cil was then stuffed with pledged abolition-
ists, and it was abolished forthwith. Len-
non’s action in “acting on the advice of his
responsible Ministers” has been greatly
applauded in dubious quarters, and his very
liigh-handed proceeding in cancelling and
ignoring the popular decision, given in legal
form, has been studiously ignored. Instances
can be quoted in plenty of Excellencies who
gave the irresponsive ear to “the advice of
their responsible advisers,” generally when
the latter wanted a dissolution and the Gov-
ernor preferred to “exhaust the House.” In
fact, precedents are all over the place, yet it
is difficult to find one which covers the De
Chair case, or makes it look any less of a
bungle and a climb-down than it did at the
beginning.

The Film “Industry” Squeals.
The N.S.W. Lang Government can take
credit for an honest attempt to make Ameri-
can film persons pay their fair share of taxa-
tion on the huge profits they draw from Aus-
tralia. For this legislation the Government
did not require its 25 new Leg. Councillors;
the bill went through the Leg. Assembly with
the blessing of Opposition-leader Bavin and
Missingham, who deputies for Butten-
sitaav, the new Cocky chief, and the other
House accepted it without amendment. In
introducing it, the Premier declared that
neither Federal nor State inoome-tax was
paid on the profits received by U.S. plioto.-
play companies from their subsidiary enter-
prises in although said profits
amounted to “many hundreds of thousands
of pounds per annum.”* The only imposts
paid were the “merely nominal” Customs
duty of lid. per foot Knd company tax on
the microscopic profit shpwn by the subsidi-
ary enterprise after from “50 to 75 p.c. of
its gross takings” had peen forwarded to
America. Lang naturally proposes to levy
on this 50 to 75 p.c., and! his measure seems
comprehensive enough. Ijt provides for
The taxation of taxable income derived from the
disposal to a person in the State, whether by sale,
lease or otherwise, by a persefn whose principal place
of business is out of the State, of any motion-picture
film not manufactured in Australia for exhibition, or
advertising matter relating thereto, or the right or
license to exhibit the -film or advertising matter, or
any other rights in connection/with the use or exhibi-
tion in the State of any speh film or advertising
matter, and which taxable injpome has been received
during the 12 months ended 'June 30, 1925, and in
each subsequent year, at the 1 rate of ss. in the £
of such taxable income, or a k, such less rate in the
£ as may for any year of income be fixed by the
Governor and notified by proclamation published in
the Gazette.
The Act would be better without the words
authorising the Government to lower the rate.
That should be Parliament's job; in any
case, no reduction should be thought of until
the Taxation Commissioner calculates that
the State has recovered the difference between
tax on nominal and real profits during the
period of evasion. The attitude of the “in-
dustry” does not suggest that collection will,
he an easy matter. Piercing squeals rent the
atmosphere when the legislation was passed,
A DINKUM DEPORTATION.
and the representative of an “ahganisation”
headed by Anocfur Zukor, grand old boy of
the bulldog breed, and in whose interests
(and those of the Anglo-Saxon race) Emil
E. S Hauer has arrived in Australia, sug-
gested in a voice broken with emotion that
the “ahganisation” might quit this ungrate-
ful continent. Such a catastrophe would
doubtless rock Australia to its foundations,
but considering that the “ahganisation” is
known to extract more wealth from the re-
mote Commonwealth (pop., 6,000,000) than
from neighboring Canada (pop., 9,000,000)
it is not at all likely to happen. Premier
Lang, however, will have to reckon with the
possibility of the “industry” shifting camp
to some other State in an effort to dodge
his well-meant tax.
♦
The Butter Subsidy.
From New Year’s Day the price of butter
throughout the Commonwealth may be ex-
pected to rise by 14d. a pound, or maybe
more, since a levy of that amount is to be
made to be applied to the payment of a
subsidy of 3d. a pound on all butter exported.
The export trade will continue to be
under the control of a marketing Board,
which will regulate the supply of butter to
London and other overseas customers, and
which proposes to hold back 25 per cent, of
supplies from mid-January onwards to pro-
tect the producer against a market glut.
These attempts at price-control and stabilisa-
tion of values, while they run counter to
most of the principles of the Freetrade school
of political economy, are the outcome not of
any doctrinaire enthusiasm on the part of
those who advocate them, but of the pro-
ducers’ sad experience of the folly of leaving
the volume of supplies to chance and the
prices to foreign wholesale dealers. The
scheme which is to be given a trial in Aus-
tralia is in essence the provision of an
export subsidy. It had many precedents
in the war period, when commodities
were under control, and a bonus was
actually applied to butter in Maoriland
in war-time, though in the reverse manner to
that adopted in Australia, the Government
making a payment to the dairy-farmers to
keep the local price of butter lower than the
half-crown a pound provided for in the
extremely lucrative English contract. Maori-
land has also gone in for dairy-export control,
but the method adopted is open to criticism,
and has, in fact, been condemned by every
Chamber of Commerce in the country.
Authority is given to a special Board by
statute law, the Board consisting of repre-
sentatives of the Government, the dairy
producers and the manufacturers of butter
and cheese. A plebiscite of the dairy-farmers
was taken before the measure became law,
and disclosed that 22,284 suppliers favored
control, while only 9,255 opposed it. But
there are over 50,000 suppliers, and the
Government was blamed for not getting an
expression of opinion from the 20,000 who
didn’t vote. There were also complaints that
the manner of electing the Board was unfair.
Mainly these manifestations may have been
due to the fact that it is extremely hard to
satisfy a farmer, especially a cow-farmer,
that he is getting a square deal; but, what-
ever their basis, the control Board has not
yet dared to exercise its full powers. The
objection of the Maoriland business com-
munity to the scheme is the participation
of the Government, which it is reckoned may
make the State some day liable for losses sus-
tained by the producers through the miscalcu-
lations of Lin injudicious marketing Board.
The Australian scheme, being on a volun-
tary basis, is subject to no such disability,
but it seems likely to be impaled on the other
horn of a dilemma —’the difficulty of obtaining
and retaining the loyal support of everyone in
the industry. Unless the agrarian tempera-
ment undergoes a radical change, the first
drop in prices—and a drop in dairy-produce
prices is not at all unlikely—will be followed
by recriminations against the marketing
Board, whereupon altruistic friends of the
poor will arise to point out that an embit-
tered argument is all that Australia is
getting for clapping £600,000 a year on to
its butter bill. As expounded by its father,
the member for Gippsland, one of the objects
of the bonus seems to be to reconcile
the farmer to tariff protection of Australian
manufacturing industry by giving him a
little protection in Iris own job. Should it
have that result, the experiment will justify
itself.
*
Tiie devotion of Small Sister's House of
Lords to the interests of propputy has led it
to make violent onslaughts upon bills re-
cently sent to it by the Assembly providing
that Hobart and Launceston should adopt
the principles of “one ratepayer one vote’’
and rating on unimproved values. The
offending clauses were contained in power-
to-borrow bills, and, to get these through, the
Assembly has dropped its demand for rating
reform, but insists manfully on franchise
reduction. One of the Hobart bills has got
through, bereft of its controversial clauses,
and the rest are shelved. In Launceston,
under the archaic franchise that prevails, a
childless Chinaman owning a quintette of
humpies in the pak-a-poo area can exercise
five times as much voting-power as a good
white Australian with a family of ten who
owns only one property. In Hobart the
maximum is four votes to an individual, but
in practically every rural municipality the
maximum is six. This state of affairs is
defended by use of a very defective analogy
with the rights of shareholders in a joint
stock company, it being held that voting
power, in a municipality as in a company
meeting, must be based on the amount of
financial holdings concerned. But the Speck’s
plural franchise doesn’t even ensure that,
since the value of a single property may be,
and often is, greater than that of a number
of small properties vested in an individual.
Such a state of affairs, coupled with Little
Sister's chronic stony-brokeness and the
exodus of her citizens at the rate of 4000 a
year because the taxes are too heavy to be
borne, suggests that at any moment there
may arise a political economist of the prac-
tical kind who may want to start economis-
ing by erasing an unpopular revisory cham-
ber and about 25 redundant municipal coun-
cils.

In one of its uninspired moments Sydney
Telegraph recently wrote about “The
Tragedy of the Black Coat,” a hot garment
very little seen in this country except on
shopwalkers. The story was to the effect
that the community is being educated too
much, and is consequently rushing the pro-
fessions instead of pursuing trades. There
is an old and moth-eaten look about the
theory that a boy or man should know just
enough for his job, and should have no
superfluous knowledge, either to entertain
himself with or to fit him for a better job.
Among persons who diffuse knowledge at
technical schools and the like there is pretty
general agreement that the youth who has
ceased from his reluctant education at the
earliest possible date is inferior material to
work on as compared with the one who has
pursued knowledge two or three years fur-
ther. A knowledge of mathematics can make
no man a worse bricklayer, while the habit
of study involved in the chase after mathe-
matics may make it easy for him to be a
better bricklayer—to brickie on a higher plane,
so to speak. What really invites the Tele-
graph’s thunder is the dreadful habit we
have fallen into of putting the brake on the
extra-good workman so that he may not
earn more money than the dud.

“Botjragi” : Now that the Federal Govern-
ment has begun to put up for sale the
expropriated German properties in New
Guinea, intending buyers would do well to
keep in mind the contingency of the Man-
dated Territories reverting to the Hun. Ever
since the Treaty of Versailles, Hans
Brigiltman lias been busy evolving new
schemes for getting back his lost colonies.
To the German, the mandates are only tem-
porary assignments; he has persistently re-
fused to relinquish his moral claim to the
lands in question, whatever he may have
agreed to abandon by the terms of the Treaty.
The Locarno Pact, with its provisions for
the admission of Germany to the League of
Nations, has strengthened Jerry’s case, and
he is hastening to take advantage of it. A
few days ago Herr Stresemann, Minister
for Foreign Affairs, told his countrymen all
about it
We shall soon be members of the League of
Nations, and then our claim to colonial mandates
can no longer be rejected.
The best of Germany’s miscellaneous swag
of colonies are the tremendously rich islands
to the north-east of this continent which
Australia at present administers. When the
new member of the League of Nations gets
up to howl for the return of his confiscated
properties, these will be the first asked for.
It is probable that, if they are eventually
returned, the Hun will be called on to give
an undertaking to respect the rights of ten-
ants in possession. But one scrap of paper
is very much like another, and anyone old
enough to remember the German’s attitude
towards British planters in possession when
he took over New Britain and New Ireland
will not burst with confidence in that under-
taking.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The S. M. Herald meant well, of course,
hut it put the matter badly (26/12/25) :
Even if a bill is brought down to abolish the
Council when the House meets in January, the
Government mav not find sufficient support in the
Council to pass it. Some of the pledged Labor mem-
bers mav be absent If such a development took
place, Mr. Lang would probably make more appoint-
ments.
It reads as if the Governor had passed into
oblivion and wholly ceased to count. 1 er-
liaps he has.
Much battered and tattered, the Vie.
Compo Cabinet managed to limp into recess
just before Christmas. It failed to carry out
its threat to resign and make way for a
Labor Government if the Uppah Chambali
threw out its Income-tax Bill, providing tor
the collection of £287,000 extra. Instead, it
climbed down and, in place of the bill laid
aside by the Plush House, accepted half ot
what was asked at first. So only another
ha’penny in the £ will be exacted on personal
exertion and a penny in the £ additional on
property and companies. lreasurer Lea-
cock persuaded his colleagues to take a halt-
loaf when they could not get a whole one.
Strictly speaking, the Council also performed
an acrobatic feat by yielding the 50 p.c.
The manner in which it left the six Labontes
stranded in the final test of strength was
comical.
Tom Walsh once pictured a good time
coming when every crew would refuse to
take its ship to sea till the ship committee
had met and “formulated its demands, ancl
these demands had been complied with.
Nothing so orderly has been accomplished,
but on eight sailings out of a recent 11 the
s.s. Manuka was held up for hours because
firemen were away drinking, and it is union
law that the liner must wait, and pay wages
while waiting, till the last drunk can be
located and brought back. It may yet be
necessary to declare all seaports dry, and
abolish every license within 10 miles ot a
wharf. Then the interior will begin to be
populated.
Dan Levy came into the N.S.W. Assembly
the other 'day as mad as all Job s boils
because of the “venomous and blackguardly
attack” made on him by another member
during his absence. But he didn’t propose
any remedy, and even when his party gets
back to power and gives him a whole terrace
of portfolios he probably won’t. The obvious
thing is to abolish the right of one member
to libel another in the House. When two or
three of the worst specimens had been ruined
by costs the respectability of the notorious
Chamber would become oppressive.
Ten days before the Vic. session closed
the Allan-Peacock team had a very poor
showing, but when the curtain fell it had a
much more decent record —it had handled
the voluntary wheat pool, superannuation for
State employees, soldier-settlement conces-
sions, street trading, country roads (million
a year for five years), teachers’ promotion,
electricity extension, sewerage for country
districts and the annual finance bills. But
there is a heap of stock-in-trade left for the
shop-window for next session.
Barwell, now a nominee Senator, has been
succeeded as S.A. Opposition-leader by R. L.
Butler. G. R. Laffer might have got the 30b,
having been Barwell’s understudy and Lands
Minister, but Laffer did not go to the ballot
and the party elected Butler. The new
man—he is reckoned a mere boy by the
patriarchs of the Lib. Union, though he
entered Parliament in 1914 —is one of the
four sons of the late Richard Butler, some-
time Father of the House, and is more tact-
ful than the old man was. He is one ot
the members for Wooroora.
After all, ‘‘Jack O’Dea, the well-known
Randwick bookmaker,” was not among the
25 M.S.W. Leg. Councillors sworn in last
week. The gentleman was recommended by
caucus (he got 27 votes), but Premier Lang
took the responsibility of excluding him, ana
thus a gleam of sanity was introduced into a
sorry business. Of late years political Labor
has been shamefully subservient to the gamb-
ling interest. Lang’s action may not liber-
ate his party from a degrading influence, but
it lias shown that he, the leader, is not m
the bag.
In spite of plotting, scheming and nego-
tiating between the Melbourne City Council
and the local Lands Department the future
of the Treasury Gardens, running from
Flinders-street to Treasury-place on the
east side of Spring-street, is
still unsettled. When the
State was found to be grudg-
ing the money necessary to
keep them reasonably tidy,
someone suggested that they
should be handed over to the
Parks and Gardens Commit-
tee of the City Council.
Cabinet readily agreed; it
was the Council that jibbed.
Some weeks ago Minister for
Lands Downward suggested
that if the Council would
take charge of the white ele-
phant he would throw in
seven or eight acres of land
in Yarra Park which it was
known to be coveting, and
Cabinet again approved joy-
ously ; but the city fathers
demanded a cash induce-
ment. Downward has now
said that he won’t let £lOOO
stand in the way of getting
rid of the incubus, and it is
probable that the Council
will accept this sum plus the
Yarra Park land, and take
control.
Some things they manage
better in S’Africa. Dieven
or twelve years ago, when a
number of persons were dis-
turbing the industrial peace
of the Rand and fomenting
strikes, Prime Minister
Botha and Attorney-General
Smuts didn’t trouble to
appoint expensive Deporta-
tion Boards or give counsel
the opportunity to argue
before the High Court. They
just grabbed 10 ringleaders,
clapped them aboard the first
train for Durban and the
first London-bound steamer
from Durban, and let it go
at that. The agitators
weren’t all outlanders, either.
Some of them strayed back
in the course of a few years,
but it is not on record that
any of them ever fell foul ot
law and order again or even
instituted actions for wrongful deportation.
What a lot of time and money would have
been saved if Bruce could have screwed
himself up to tear a leaf out of Botha s
book!
N.S.W. Premier Lang expects to receive
£50,000 p.a. from his 25 per cent, impost
on foreign film profits which have hitherto
escaped the Australian tax-collectors. _ I er-
haps £150,000 p.a. will be forthcoming if
similar legislation is passed by the other
States and the Commonwealth, as it should
be. Without such legislation, Langs tax
may be dodged; with it, Australia will be
sure of getting a little of its own back.
Contrary to expectation, Vic. Parliament
in the dying hours of the session passed a
bill restricting juvenile trading (Princi-
pally ; Eralo selling) in the streets. The
Leg. Council spurned the measure m the
form it was sent up by the Assembly, and
twice it seemed to be doomed. But while
waiting for big business from the Assembly
the landlords recast the proposals, and gave
the Governor-in-Council, from July 1, 1926,
power to make regulations for licensing boys
over 12 years of age. No girl under 21 is to
be allowed to trade, and that will be one
blessing. Vested interest#!, which were more
than a trifle perturbed at the proposed re-
form, managed to get sis months m which
to adjust things. It came out m the course
of the negotiations that one-third ot the
paper-sellers are under ,12.
Not before it is time', the Queensland.
Government has decided to sell Buckingham
Downs station, an area of over 3000 square
miles, between Dajarra and Boulia. I lie
station and the cattle thereon were bought
at boom prices about seven years ago, and
heavy losses have been made, chiefly because
the Government did not follow the advice ot
W. G. Brown, the sheep and wool expert
attached to the Bureau of Agriculture and
Stock, who recommended substituting sneep
for cattle on certain parts of the run. If
the policy pursued at Buckingham Downs
is a fair sample of that on other State
stations, it is not surprising that a dehcit ot
£BOO,OOO has resulted from seven years ex-
perience of State station enterprises.
The Ma State’s soldier-settlement accounts
look murky enough to have been pulled down
the chimney. Up to June 30, £17,384,0dd
had been spent and 9098 soldiers settled ;
but they were gummed down so loosely that
2135 have transferred, forfeited or surren-
dered, leaving 0963 in occupation, more or
less, of 8,081,070 acres. Repayments to date
total £697,155 off principal and £230,133 for
interest —the interest payments were insuffi-
cient to give an annual 1] pet cent, even on
the three millions or so advanced under the

ment groans that the financial position of

many of the settlers is unsatisfactory, and
that further relief will have to be gi\en if
they are to stay settled.
On New Year’s Day in London the sun
rises after eight and sets before four, while
the average temperature is about 40deg. At
latest advices 3000 women and children there-
abouts were without means of support because
their seafaring husbands left off work in
Australia to follow the gory banner ol
Walsh and Johanson. The National Sea-
men’s and Firemen’s Union (Havelock Wil-
son’s show) is spending much money m
relief, and it has cabled to Toni Walsh here,
asking him to save his soul by making an
effort to raise £3OOO for the victims of lus
sin and vanity. It is rumored that a mes-
sage has also been sent to Hell for ice.
Sanguine people seek benefits in strange
places.
The fortieth annual convention of the
A.W.U., which opens at Brisbane on January
21, will consider a motion for the abolition
of piecework. There is certain to be oppo-

A close-at-hand precedent in the matter-of
deportations within the Empire 'dP« .d
in JS9O. King Tubou, of Tonga, had as his
Prime Minister one Waldemar Shirley Baker,
who had made himself, m a constitutional
way, the boss of Tonga. In 188 < there was
an attempt to assassinate Baker, who dealt
in a very high-handed manner with the
natives in consequence. So far he was
probably on safe enough ground, but no
went out of his bailiwick and accused t e
British Vice-Consul of having instigated the
murder plot. Relations were strained be-
tween Baker and the British authorities
thereafter, and finally the High Commis-
sioner of the Western Pacific sent a warship
to Tongatabu from Fiji and deported Baker
to Maoriland under sentence to stay away
for five years. As a matter of fact lie stayed
away for 10.
The Queensland anti-Labor Opposition has
changed its name for the umpteenth time.
Within the last few years it has been the
Nationalist party, the National Democratic
Union, the Country party and the Lnited
party, and the Country Progressive party.
Its latest title is the Country and Progres-
sive National party. These kaleidoscopic
changes of name and groupings of the Oppo-
sition have helped to keep Labor m power
for 10 years.
Melbourne will have to wait many more
months to see a start made on the Spencer-
street bridge. The Uppah Cliambah, the
members of which sit only about oO days a
year for their £2OO, were too fagged in - the
closing hours of the session to seriously dea.
with a bill to hand over the construction to
the Metropolitan Board of Works. lhe
power given in one of the clauses to rate up
to 2d. in the £ was the one that made mem-
bers so tired. The House of Landlords hates
making financial provision for things by
rates or taxes.
It is the polite thing for ex-Excellencies to
be flabbergasted at the wonderful progress ot
this country, and Lord Forster did the coi-
rect thing on his return to London. He
dwelt on the gratifying fact that much more
than half the people of Australia are capital-
ists in the sense of having a savings-bank
account (average amount, £46), and one-third
own a life policy as well. To this it may be
regretfully added that in 1924 the savings-
bank balances and the assets of life-msurance
concerns amounted to about £27o,Ow,J<JU,
while the State foreipn debts (peace debts
incurred abroad to make prosperity) ran to
over £342 000,000. Last year for which figures
are available the State foreign debts in-
creased about four times faster than the
savings-bank and life-assurance savings com-
bined. . .
The news that Italy proposes, in imitation
of ancient Rome, to style herself an empire
once again, recalls that the fief of Mussolini
is the only European country that China m
her feebleness has had the temerity to snub.
In the general scramble for “concessions
that took place about 1897, Italy felt she was
being left behind and put in a demand tor
San men, one of the finest potential naval
bases in the Flowery Land. Even the spine-
less statesmen of Peking found this too much
and a brusque refusal was the answer, a
refusal which the demauder, being somewhat
weak in ships and guns, took lying down.
How illogical Vic.’s Uppali Cliambah can
be was proved when the House cheer-
fully passed the Teachers’ Promotion Bill,
which will heavily increase expenditure, after
it had twice refused to grant additional in-
come-tax to balance the ledger. Ot the A*
landlords who put their backs up against
the extra Id. in the £ on personal exertion
and 2d. in the £ on property and companies,
three were Cockies and six Labontes. lhe
other 11 were Libs. Seven of them could
hardly claim that their constituents were
behind them; at any rate, seven other mem-
bers representing the same (double-seated)
provinces supported the bill. The voting so
far as these seven districts were concerned
thus cancelled itsel/ just as it does m scores
of cases. The referendum is the answer to
all that stupidity. - ...
Sam Barnes, M.L.A. for Valhalla (Vic.),
will have to wait a little longer to see the
main line to Sale run through Yallourn and
pass behind the ’Aunted ’llls —the aspiration
of Barnes’s riper years. The Railway Com-
mittee says it cannot yet recommend any
diversion of the existing line between Moo

to be content with its cockspur till it be-
comes as big as it is planned to be. lhere
has been bitter criticism of the Morwell
scheme, and an expert from America is to
tell the public whether it is being worker,
on right lines, financially and otherwise.
THE WRECKING GANG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr Bavin said that not a single one of the
25 newlv-appointed M’s.L.C. had been selected on
the ground of public service or ability to improve
legislation. They had been chosen by ballot—to
do what the head of the Government told them to
do. Rubber men would have been less expensive.
No more festina lente
Or dolce far niente;
Five stalwart men and twenty
' Have got their work to do.
No odds to them, no matter,
What gibes around them spatter,
Their job’s to bash and batter
All Labor measures through.
No eloquence shall swing them,
No cutting insults sting them,
No cogent logic bring them,
In homely phrase, across.
Not theirs to make deductions
On how to obviate ructions,
But to obey instructions
And not to nark the Boss.
Ho! Ashton and Carruthers
And five and thirty others,
The jig is up, my brothers,
The fat is in the fire!
From countryside and c-ity
They come, unknowing pity,
Political banditti
Resolved to earn their hire.
They swarm to the offensive
With wreckers’ zeal intensive.
Are human beings expensive
When dummies might be got?
Why worry? Five and twenty,
Whom Labor cognoscenti
Deem for the work aplenty—
And cheap, dirt-cheap, the lot!

Paid capital at June 30 was £2.250,000
(750,000 £5 shares paid to £3) compared
with £1,500,000 ( 600,000 paid to £2 10s.) at
the beginning of the term ; but tlie new money
was not available in time to do much work
for the present accounts. Nevertheless some-
thing rich had to be disclosed, for the bank's
year (headquarters are in London, lienee the
belated accounts) included tlie period of those
wool-sales at which hectic competition forced
prices sky-high ; also the record sugar crop
and the fat prices for lead and zinc. Tlie
E., S. and A. must have done particularly
Well out. of metals, and it doubtless got a
tidy share of tlie wheat, sugar and wool
financing. It was helped last year perhaps
more than in any other of recent times by
its perpetual stocks : £983.547 of 4 p.e. de-
benture. £889.419 of 3 p.e. preferred inscribed
and £335,000 of 3 p.e. deferred inscribed.
These are relics of the troubles of the 'nine-
ties. The deferred stock was given a right
to 44 p.e. if profits allowed, and lias had the
maximum since early in the present century.
One-fourth of surplus profits after paying
interest on tlie other stocks has to ’he
applied to its redemption. Last year £02,500
set aside purchased £65,000 worth, the issue
being, of course, at a discount in the
market. Tlie purchased stock is cancelled
and the amount struck off premises. Over
£400,000 has . been thus written off in the
past 12 years, so that a considerable reserve
is hidden in the premises item, which at
June 30 figured at £782,457. Tlie three lots
of old debt called for £Bl,OOO-odd interest.
Given only safe work to do, the money must
have earned half as much again.
The-rate of increase in gross profits eased
up a bit: —
1922, 1923. 1924. 1925.
Gross
profits £1,094,689 £1,251,197 £1,304,456 £1,355,328

Net profit £345,474 £470,848 £502,502 £515,981
For the first four years following the incor-
poration of the businesses of the London of
Australia and Commercial of Tasmania the
progress was dazzling. Last year’s visible
increase in gross profits was less than
£51,000; but with the three-quarters of a mil-
lion of new capital doing full shift for the
present 12 months there should be more to-
show at the next reckoning. Divs. of 124
p.c. on present paid capital of £2,250,000
call for £281,250 —little more than half last
year’s net business profits. In the circum-
stances shareholders are given more grounds
for hopes than for fears.
Here is a three years’ picture of tlie busi-
ness :

Total . . £32,779,687 £33,644,878 £34,548,930
It is difficult to say what part the country’s
exceptional prosperity, real and artificial,
played in those figures. A respectable vol-
ume of advances must have been liquidated,
yet the net result was a very slight decrease.
That suggests that as the money flowed in
it was sent out into new business. The in-
crease iu cash holdings may have been
assisted somewhat by the last _ payments on
the new shares (£300,000), which came in a
few weeks before the close of the accounts.
However, as the figures stood on June 30,
47.4 p.e. of outside liabilities was held liquid,
and to represent the balance (£14,506,775)
were advances of ±20,635,697 and premises
written down to £782,457. Depositors are
very comfortable with such security, and
borrowing clients are well placed in that the
bank is in a position to expand its advances
by several millions without cutting too tine
the proportion of funds to outside liabilities.
For nearly half a century its policy matched
the ecclesiastical architecture of its chief
premises. In the past dozen or so years it
lias become a go-getter among banks. Cir-
cumstances have altogether favored the new
policy: the almost unbroken prosperity of
the country has given the banks great pro-
fits with very few heavy losses. Internal
reserves have thus, as a rule, been dammed
up: the contingencies for which they have
been provided haven't arisen. It is very
largely to use up these undisclosed profits
that various banks have been doing so much
lately to their office premises. This paper
doubts whether the IT, S. and xV.’s internal
reserves are proportionately as strong as
those of some others, notwithstanding the
help it gets from the repurchase of stock
before mentioned; but its visible reserves
are very solid : —almost equal to paid capital.
And certainly they need to be solid with a
div. rate fixed so high and £20,600,000 of.
advances to watch.

There is in Australia a growing disposition
to trust the trustee office, chiefly because
trusteeship is its job and it guarantees that
it will be alive and on the spot when it is
wanted —and they are things no private trus-
tee can possibly guarantee. In the general
expansion of business the National is‘ no
doubt a full participator; but on that point
nothing definite can be said, this being one
of the few offices which keep silence about
the value of the trusts in hand. All that
van be said definitely is that, though it seems
to have a very good business, it lias been
rather a poor profit-maker. Last year,
thanks to a cut in its expense rate, things
were distinctly better; yet even then the
disclosed profits were only a shade over 8
p.e. on the shareholders’ funds; and as prac-
tically all the shareholders’ funds in a trus-
tee business can be invested in securities that
should' earn at least as much interest as
Government stock, it didn’t look as though
much cream was skimmed off the trustee
business —either that or income from invest-
ments was poor. Earnings, etc., are shown
in this comparison :

The swing back in the matter of exes, is
comforting, for they bad been exceeding the
speed limit. Balance-sheet movements were
not important—they rarely are :

Perhaps weakness lies in that free-
holds item; it may be that the co.
is paying a very stiff rent to itseit.
In addition to total shareholders’ funds of
£69,060 there is £112,500 of uncalled capital
to secure the confidence of beneficiaries and
intending clients. Capital is well guarded
and, though there has not been a wide mar-
gin beyond the 10 p.e. divs., occasional plums
are a possibility of the future, especially if
the improvement in profits can be maintained
—as they should be. The extra 2 p.e. for
the past year masquerades as a bonus; but
a div. by any other name tastes just as
sweet.

A net surplus of £12,140 on realised assets
assisted last year's return. Kauri lias found
its freeholds a profitable asset and unearned
increment will doubtless do its bit in the
future as in the past. Investments must have
been responsible for a substantial portion of
the revenue, for public securities, loans on
mortgage and shares in other cos. amounted
on August 31 to £202,080. Gross earnings
and outgoings compared with those of pre-
vious years as follows :

There was ample for the modest div. —the
modesty vanishes after a glance at the centre
of the introductory table so far as most of
the shares are concerned—and more than
half as much was sent to reserves. These
latter, by the way, are detailed and the
various movements shown. Here they are
since 1923

Most of those reserves sound specific enough;
but at the 1923 meeting the directors in-
dicated that really they were banked-up profits.
Whether such is completely the case depends
on the value placed upon freehold and lease-
hold properties, including the standing timber
thereon. Land values may be estimated with
reasonable accuracy, although at present
Maoriland ideas on this subject need to be
looked at with a bilious eye to be on the safe
side. Timber, however, is another matter. To
read the glowing promises in recent afforesta-
tion floats is to be impressed with the won-
derful wealth in wood. But the experience of
millers and merchants in Australia during
the past two years has not been gold-dipped.
Inaccessibility of local growth and keenness
of competition from overseas has depressed
values, and standing timber may be worth
anything down to nothing. In this matter
the past control of Kauri Timber is reassur-
ing : values have doubtless been written in
with caution. In any case timber forms only
a comparatively moderate part of the assets.
Here are balance-sheet figures:—
1922. 1924. 1925.

The kauri areas of Maoriland have been
almost worked out, and, with the exception
of a few areas, only scattered “sticks” are
available. However, the balance-sheet groups
indicate that the co. is prepared for a dimin-
ishing return from its timber holdings. Five
years ago in the reconstruction £135,009 was
returned, and double that amount could be
handed back to-day without difficulty.

Reserves had to be called on to permit of
the 5 p.c. to ordinaries. Since the close
of the accounts part of the co.’s nine acres
at Merrylands has been sold and the direc-
tors anticipate that “this sale will materially
assist in disposing of the remainder.” The
Board attaches a lot of importance to the
sale of its holdings, for the ambition to be-
come a manufacturer of fertilizers has long
since withered away, arid the big block is no
longer of importance except for profit on
realisation. Trade was a shade better last-
year, but is still wretchedly small: —

And there is no kick in it. Creditors needn’t
worry, however; cash in hand alone is
greater than total liabilities. Liquid assets
as at August 31 amounted to £14,751 with
plant, land and buildings in at £10,398. Capi-
tal is £23,140.

The extra 24 p.c. was labelled “bonus”; but
even 12-4 p.c. soaked up less than two-thirds
of disclosed profits, and in the past four
years, while £58,7118 lias been made, only
£31,875 has been distributed. The directors,
nevertheless, prefer to increase divs. rather
than bite into reserves for a bonus issue;
and although accumulations are fat, there
is a lot to recommend this policy. The pre-
sent and the immediate future are very
bright; but one misfortune is liable to bring
on another, and if two or three bad seasons
induced or compelled a stoppage of our
borrowing—well, some of us would go out
so suddenly we wouldn’t know what had hit
us. For the moment competition in the
trade is pretty keen, but there is big business
offering, and Lamson Paragon has shown
that it can win its share. The Westralian
offshoot, in which the co. has £13,334. con-
tributed a 10 p.c. div. and £487 profit was
made on the sale of the co.’s old site.

Increased return from the Combine —£18,896
compared with the previous year’s £17,402 —
accounted for the greater profit. The div.
was promptly boosted to 12.8 p.c. When
Carlton and United Breweries, Ltd.,
was formed to combine the Melbourne
brew-pies (except the Co-operative), the
Castlemaine beer foundry was closed and
the co. received a parcel of scrip which,
by additions from time to time, has
grown to £102,500 in ords. and £14,914 in
prefs. As. the paper contains a fair percent-
age of moisture, reserves of the introductory
table are marked nominal. But its profit-
earning capacity, judged on the increasing
returns of recent years, is improving.
Whether that process will continue is one of
the points to be considered; the 1 >rys have
lost ground during the last campaigns, but
they are not dead, and nobody can tell with
certainty what the future will do in the
name of democracy. Apart from that, he
would be a bold man who would maintain
that Australia will always have as much
loan and other money to jingle on the coun-
ter as it has to-day. Certainly the profits
would not have to be much leaner to imperil
this co.’s 124 p.c. Balance-sheet figures com-

Automobile Investment Co. of Austra-
lia, Ltd., in 300,000 shares of £1 each, is
one of many. The public is offered 285,000
shares and the directors think not more
than 10s. will be called; 15,000 shares are
reserved for promoters, but will be issued
only to the extent of 5 p.c. of total issued
capital. The principles of motor financing
are sound; the car is sold under hire-pur-
chase, two-thirds to three-quarters of the
price being advanced at 8 p.c. to 10 p.c.,
payable in from 12 to 24 monthly instal-
ments. A comprehensive insurance policy
is insisted on. Profit is made from com-
mission from the agent and from the insur-
ance co., and from the interest charged,
which, owing to the monthly payments,
works out at from 15 p.c. to 20 p.c. p.a.
Whether theory and practice square depends
wholly on management; all that can be said
on that point is that the five directors of
this co. are substantial men. A further
query is, of course, whether the present
record buying of cars will continue. “There
must be an end to it” has been said so often ;
yet no indication of diminishing demand is
visible. And now saturation-point is being
pushed further into the future by reduc-
tion of prices.

mildali Co. and 10,000 contribs. are re-
served. Astrolabe Bay, Madang, is to be
the scene of operations, Erina Harbor being
in the vicinity. Dr. Jensen, who made a
minute examination of the area, expresses
views favorable to the possibilities of oil
on geological deductions. Gas seeps are plen-
tiful, and at one spot between Tadabu and
Maisa Jensen says he expects oil to be struck
at less than 1000 ft.

The report of the liquidation of British
Broken Hill makes interesting reading. The
North bought the British Co.’s properties for
£140,625 cash and 100,000 Norfh shares,
besides surrendering 150,000 British shares
to that co. The liquidation div. amounted to
4-15ths of a North share and 7s. 6d. cash
for each of 375,000 British shares. The reali-
sation worked out at £2 4s. 7d. for every
old British share, plus Bs. 9£d. in divs. paid
by the North during the liquidation period.
Which is not so bad, considering. The
winding-up of the British cost £llB2, and
£3972 is held by the Board of Trade, Lon-
don, for unclaimed dividends; £4687 was paid
as compensation to the directors and certain
officers not taken over by the North Co., and
liquidators’ fees were also paid out of that
amount.

Bribbaree (N.S.W 1 .) showed £2416 net
profit when balancing at October 31, and
a credit of £1521 went forward after liquid-
ating the loss of £895 incurred during the
first working year. The battery reduced
1766 tons for 27620 z. smelted gold, valued at
£10,495. Out of tffis wages took £5243, and
the actual mine profit of £4120 was eaten
into for £950 preliminary and flotation exes.
The cyanide plant has a capacity of 200
tons a month, and to date 160 tons treated
have yielded £250. TTie co. has £2OOO at
fixed deposit, £5BB in cash, £348 in bullion,
and stores valued at £133. It owed £217.
The adjoining Bonanza lease has been ac-
quired “on reasonable terms.” The co. is
the only one in N.S.W. mining for gold and
finding the quest promising, but the faces
underground don’t look like dividends just
yet.

Lucknow Pups (N.S.W.) still battles
along economically and gamely without justi-
fying McFadzean’s hopes. The past year’s
operations showed £407 from the Aid Ad-
vance by the Mines Department as the only
income, against which had to be set a
mining expenditure of £2481, mostly wages,
leaving £2074 to be transferred to the sink
called mine account, which has now reached
the tidy sum of £22,827. The cost of admin-
istration was £720. There was still £399 at
current account. Paid capital figures at
£26,436, and a contingent liability of £1396
has been built on prospecting aid, to be
repaid in the event of the co. happening on
payable ore bodies. Only two 3d. calls a
year are being made; the next effort with
the hat may be expected in March. The co.
has 23,150 forfeited shares, and these, in
accord with the general policy, are being
distributed pro rata among those who have
continued to pay up. In this way 57,000
defaulting shares were kept alive in connec-
tion with an earlier call.

After three years of work the Digger
Prince, Gulgong (N.S.W.), has hopes. Direc-
tor Robinson and manager Cock think there
are prospects of the wash in the southern
drive becoming payable as the working is
pushed further along. To hasten the verdict
on these conclusions it has been decided to
put on three shifts early in the New Year.
But funds are low, and unless something pro-
mising turns up very soon further capital is
not likely to come in.

Under-Secretary Mance, of the N.S.W.
Mines Department, reporting for 1925,
awards the high honors to silver-lead, coal
and cement production. Tin is looking up a
little, but gold is in the doldrums —the glitter
of a press-boomed “discovery” at old Luck-
now having faded into thin vapor. Gross
value of minerals won for the year is over
£18,600,000, being nearly 21 millions above
the greatest record hitherto. The 1925 effort
has lifted the aggregate value of N.S.W.
mineral production to £403,500,000. The
Broken Hill figure of £5,607,000 for 1924
should be eclipsed easily. And prospects are
brilliant. Block 10 has been re-opened and
the fire in the Central has been so far beaten
that ore raising has been resumed. Produc-
tion for the field, at 1,242,000 tons, shows
an increase of 190,000 tons above the 1924
figure; and the 5858 employees are 450
more than at the end of 1924. The £260,000
worth of tin won in 1924 should be exceeded
when all the returns are in, thanks largely
to the enhanced price. Cement should figure
well ahead of the 272,300 tons valued at
£1,200,000 recorded for 1924. Coal output
of 11,000,000 tons will be about 600,000 tons
below 1924, the shipping hold-up being re-
sponsible for the lower figure. The North
will show about 74 million tons, the South
2 millions, and the West 1$ millions.
Aggregate output of N.S.W. collieries to the
end of 1925 will run to 310 J millioD tons.

Peak, Cobar (N.S.W.), has accumulated
288 tons of ore worth just under £2 a ton,
and six toffs of high-grade shipping stuff.
The plant is being improved by the addition
of a Wilfley table.
* * * #
Although Great Victoria (W.A.) has an
ore-body on the Yilgarn field which is too
low-grade to pay under present conditions,
it has a lateritic deposit which has proved
an unexpected asset. It enabled the co. to
pay off all liabilities and have something in
hand to work its newly-acquired French’s
mine. As prospects on this show are good,
the co.’s future looks hopeful.

Golden Horseshoe management (W.A.)
recently cabled London office that owing to
reduction in available tonnage the 100-head
battery would for the time being run only
one shift, and the cyanide plant two shifts,
a day. Developmental work, it was added,
should increase tonnage later on. In May
last reserves were estimated at over half a
million tons, but apparently the bulk of this
is not considered payable under present con-
ditions, which would explain why the co. has
curtailed milling.

Golden Butterfly has flown from the West
and alighted at Sturt Meadows, near Broken
Hill. For years it flitted from field to field
in Groperland, and had more than its share
of duffers or has-beens. Now it claims to
have got hold of something with “good pros-
pects and outcrops throughout,” Reports
just as glowing were broadcasted about most
of its previous ventures, but for the sake of
the unfortunate shareholders The Bulletin
hopes that this one will turn out different.
* * * *
Dr. Wade’s last report for the Common-
wealth on the possibilities of finding com-
mercial oil in the southern portion of the
continent rules out the Lake Macdounell
(S.A.) and Fitzgerald River (W.A.) regions
as geologically unsuitable, but is less pessi-
mistic about the region of the lower Glenelg
River (Vic.). Apart from the apparent
folding recorded by prior observers in this
district —folding which Wade interprets as
false bedding in the pleistocene dune forma-
tions overlying the older tertiaries —he defi-
nitely finds evidence of true folding in the
latter and recommends intense surveying with
palaeontological co-operation to try to locate
any closed structures present, before any fur-
ther “wild-catting” is undertaken. While
attaching little significance to the oil seep-
age in the river itself —which he suggests
might originate from the detrital carbon-
aceous muds—the revealing of a good closed
structure suitable for test bore sites is con-
sidered most important, as one test bore
should go far to settle the problem of
whether oil deposits do or do not exist in
the series.
* * * *
F. G. Brown, who went to Hcrbcrton
(N.Q.) to assume command at the Koor-
boora and Gurrumba tin-mines, recently
floated in Sydney, has exhibited commend-
able hustle. So far is he ahead of the
schedule that the next few days should see
ore being hauled from some of the leases,
and the stamps dropping, in February. Origi-
nally production was timed for March, and
some of the quidnuncs laughed audibly.
It needed Alfred Ashbolt’s speech to clear
up the Tongkah Harbor outlook. Much that
he says has a Lindesay Clark ring about it,
but nowadays tin-dredging ground in “the
East” can be bored so exactly that results
should go close to the sampling. The eo.'s
deep ground in Puket Sound is still to be
given a go, but not till No. 7 dredge is made
—whether in Holland or here is a detail un-
said. There is also a mystery about the
manner of the deep dredging. Chelong Bay
is the present hope of the co.. It is figured
that in 400 acres the 17,000,000 c. yards
tested will carry 0.71 b. of oxide, or a bulk
content of 5408 tons, which it will take No.
6 plant 174 years to disinter. If the rest
of the Chelong Bay area goes equally as well
there will be room for another big plant.
No. 6 plant is expected to give 30 tons of
oxide a month from Chelong Bay, which
will keep the till comfortably full. The co.’s
No. 2 asset is the Bidor block, of 550 acres,
near Kuala Lumpur. It goes 0.751 b. oxide,
sweet stuff in these days. Bang Tao can
live for two or three years, which will give
time for Nos. 4 and 5 plants tp be found a
new site. The co.’s cash position is fair —
there is a neSt-egg of 132,000. Bond, of
Hobart, is sponsor for the new issue of
shares, which is to bring in £63,800. So
even if the two new dredges should cost
£OO,OOO or £lOO,OOO the capital cost is in
hand. Profits are being earned, too, so it
isn’t an idle dream to think of divs. in April,
as Ashbolt foretells.
* * * *
New Ristori Co., Allendale (Vic.), has
been fighting the water in its gutter. The
original Ristori, on the same lead as the
Lone Hand and Madame Berry, produced
104.2240 z. of gold with a capital of only
£6650. The old co. paid £200,000 in divs.
The Mines Department came to the aid of
New Ristori and seven bores have been
drilled. Good values were got from the wash
dirt in No. 7 bore at 303 feet. No.* 8 bore-
hole will be put down 400 feet further on
to the north-west, with a view to picking a
site for a new shaft. Local opinion thinks
well of the new development and the Cres-
wick district is backing its faith with calls.
Thirty-five mines from the Berry lead and
its tributaries raised 1,629,1410 z. of goni
worth £6,659,040, and the figures encourage
the idea that another rich lead has been
found.
* * * *
Less chatty than usual was that remark-
ably virile veteran, William Orr, at the
Ilampden-Cloncurry corroboree, perhaps be-
cause Shackell’s gimlet-eye bored into him.
The Mt. Elliott deal is off, but some palaver-
ing is being done with the Labor Govern-
ment in Queensland, which may be persuaded
to buy and treat some ore in the co.’s mine-
dumps. But can it be imagined that Collins
House would let the State walk in to make a
profit when it might earn one for itself?
Perish the thought! It would be a good bit
of business to get the smelter leased for a
while. Then income would , flow in and dc-
preciation would be checked.
* * * *
Loch Fyne (Vic.), working at No. 1 level,
has cut into a fresh make of stone, and
James Mackay’s office cat again smiles. A
little lot of 280 tons went 30dwt. a ton,
leaving a profit with which to pay for further
skirmishing in the big dyke basin. The
drawback of the mine is the lack of proved
reserves. Even if the shoot should develop
length it is never certain when mining in
diorite that the next foot overhead or ahead
won’t see the quartz cut out. Loch Fyne
has been such a stringer for the last 40
years that its market jumps have to be
taken most cautiously.
* * # *
Bendigo still drifts and now records only
an output of 18,3380 z., the lowest since the
district began. The 1924 return of 26,2190 z.
was bad enough, but the disintegration of
Dyason’s Bendigo Amalgamated, high costs,
low purchasing power of gold and the failure
of the side-lines to prospect well are factors
which would bring output down in any indus-
try. The only dividend-payer was the old Her-
cules, and it gave only £l3 500. As calls
were £30,312 the debit record of the field is
lengthened. In 1914 its yield was 160,0000 z.
and before then the average for years was
over 200,0000 z., with a big margin of divs.
over calls. As the dead worx of last year
was very solid, especially with the New
Blues, the divvy list will probably see an
expansion in 1926.
* * * *
Bulk-mining the Oaks field (N.Q.) looks
like being a thing of the past, judged by
the Mountain King’s bulk-crushing of 99
tons from the whole formation. The yield
was 37.50 z. gold, which did not pay. It
appears as if the gouger will be the only
one to make a success of the rich little gash
veins which are a feature of the field. And
these are getting very scarce.
* * * *
Borirg of the N.Q. areas held by the
Palmer River Gold Co., according to Arthur
Clarke proves the old Strathleven area of
300 acres to be a payable bucket-dredging
proposition. As it is a good, free wash work-
ing costs have been fixed at 6d., said to be a
penny above estimates. Working exes., how-
ever, don’t always run true to forecasts.
The Annan River Co.'s bucket-dredge has
been secured for £3OOO. Its pre-war price
was £14.500, and as it was in use only seven
months the co. considers it has got a bargain.
The dredge has a capacity of 40,000 c. yds.
per month. The co. is in 43,000 shares —
23,000 fully-paid. No cash was given to
vendors. Another 22,000 shares are to be
issued shortly. The Palmer was one of the
richest alluvial fields discovered in Aus-
tralia. Over £6,000,000 worth of gold was
recovered, apart from what was taken out
by Chinese, of whom there were 35,000 on
the field at one time.
The pursuit of oil in Taranaki continues,
the only result being a deepening of holes.
The Tarata bore at 4100 ft. and the Moturoa
at 3.190 ft. approach warmer latitudes. The
Tarata derrick has been strengthened in view
of the increased strain in handling the easing.

ment, bits of uniform, barbed-wire, etc., are
still everywhere. The trenches are, of course,
falling in, but their formation is still dis-
tinct. Nearly all the dugouts on the beach
have disappeared, but a few uprights of the
old pier still show,- and remnants of one or
two boats can be seen in the water. The
Turks in the vicinity during our visit were
very friendly, but it was quite a different
pair of sleeves at Constantinople. Frequently
we were spat at, and the womenfolk would
always cross the road rather than come in
contact with “Ingleezis.”
“Moreton”: The Labor Minister has some
queer jobs. Home Secretary Stopford (Q.)
tells a story of a model husband encountered
among his Mt. Morgan constituents. While
he was on shift the missus would sit in a
pub parlor tilling ’em up again. Regularly
every night at closing time the faithful hus-
band would call at the pub with a wheel-
barrow and trundle his spouse home. He
was engaged in this conjugal duty one even-
ing when the Home Secretary came across
him. “This is the missus, Jim,’’ said the
husband, waving his hand towards the sleep-
ing beauty; “I’ll introduce you if you like.”
“Oh, don’t disturb her on my account,” said
Stopford hastily. And Minister and miner
walked along amicably, taking turns at!
pushing the wheelbarrow.

“Munara Gully”: One of the quaintest
characters and toughest battlers who ever
pervaded the W.A. goldfields—he had worked
his way right round from Queensland and,
after a lot of vicissitudes, struck it rich at
Peak Hill in the mid-’nineties —was “Tom
the Rager,” whose real surname was Meehan.
For some years after acquiring his wealth
Tom raged and shouted at and for all and
sundry in every pub on the Murchison, but
there was a streak of shrewdness in the
old roysterer, too, and he finally left W.A.
with enough to keep him in more than com-
fort for the brief remainder of his life. It
was a police inspector at Cue who once
showed me a wire from a subordinate at
Nannine, 60 miles away, constituting a fairly
typical record of one of the Rager’s perfect
days: “Tom Meehan arrived from Cue this
morning in a badly-smashed buggy patched
up with fencing-wire. He’s been drinking
round the hotels all day and complaining
that his ribs hurt.” A. later message ran:
“Doctor has diagnosed Meehan’s injuries as
four broken ribs. ’ The only other report
of the mishap that reached Cue was brought
along next day by a teamster who declared
that he had seen Tom, after the smash, put-
ting the remains of the horse into what was
left of the buggy and wiring not only the
vehicle but the animal together. He hinted
a strong suspicion that the ancient battler
had patched up Ids own ribs with fencing-
wire, too, before he was able to resume
progress towards the Nannine pubs.

“Percy Pawnticket”: Melbourne, a some-
what self-righteous city in many ways, is
remarkably tolerant of the women who
patrol Swanston and
Collins streets in
the exercise of their
dingy calling. Most
cities pu s h the
ladies of the pave
into the less fre-
quented streets;
but in Melbourne
the man who hap-
pens to make an
appointment at,
say, the Town
Hall corner is
likely to be ad-
dressed in terms of
violent endearment
by half a dozen
persons of the other
sex within as many
minutes. The more
or less punctual
foot of the law
plods these pave-
ments at regular
intervals, but only
notices anything
wrong when some
of the harpies take
a too-public help-
ing from some
i drunk’s pocket.
The ill-natured
suspicion that the
Victorian police,
who are accused of
claiming many per-
quisites, charge a
ground - rent for
Collins-street pave-
ments might be set
at rest if this and
one or two other
much - frequented
thoroughfares were
cleaned up a little.
“Sixenate”: A lady who. admitted being
a grandmamma has been the latest appli-
cant to the Sydney courts for that solatium
for wounded feelings which the Law says
may follow a breach of promise of marriage
The story told by the lady, who has counted
56 winters, was that, having taken a job
of housekeeper, she found her 65-year-old
employer a glutton for kisses, and, overcome
by his young, passionate ardor, she allowed
him to anticipate the joys of matrimony on
the strict understanding that matrimony
would follow; the other oldster’s yarn was
that all the "advances came from her, and —
she evidently having reached the stage of
speaking her thoughts aloud —he had heard
her muttering: “Well, he has a home; I
haven’t,” which he mentioned as a probable
explanation of her conduct. The romance
ended with a curt note enclosing a week’s
wages in lieu of notice; a lot of men would
like to be able to terminate their intrigues
as easily. The Law, remarking that both
parties were old enough to know better,
laughed the case out of court, which, of
FOR THAT TIRED FEELING.
“Come and try the new steps.”
“Too fagged.”
“You'll like them — they're for sitting on.”
course, was the proper thing to do. Yet
the elderly female, disappointed in prob-
ably her last possible gamble to win
for her old age something better than the
pension, might easily deserve more sym-
pathy than the able-bodied young woman who
should be glad to get rid of a faithless
swain.
* * * *
“Adamascus”: A Queensland couple mar-
ried in 1918 and separated after a few
months of matrimony. The next the lady
heard of her spouse was that he had died.
In 1922 she married again, but within a
month had quarrelled with and left her
second husband. Subsequently No. 1 turned
up, very much alive, and the lady imme-
diately set about securing a divoi'ce from him.
Meanwhile No. 2 had been hearing things,
and he applied for a declaration of nullity
of his marriage. The two cases were heard
the other day in the Supreme Court at
Townsville, one after the other. The lady
secured her divorce and the second “hus-
band” his declaration of nullity, leaving all
parties free to sit up aiid take notice again.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: A gallant needs to take his
courage in his hands when he attends the
average Melbourne dance nowadays. Re-
cently some young blades returning from a
ball murderously assaulted one of their
number and threw him into a creek, from
the mud of which he was barely rescued
alive. Another young man has been telling
a police court how he was invited to a
pleasant evening in a private house only to
be hit on the head with a bottle; “that
was the end of the evening as far as 1
was concerned.” Yet again, on a recent
Saturday night, the police had to arrest a
party of youths who, armed with stones
tied in handkerchiefs, were chasing some
fellow guests at a dance in an adjacent drill
shed. This was in East Melbourne, which,
from the position of social eminence con-
ferred by fiats and boarding-houses, sniffs
haughtily at the mere mention of adjacent
Fitzroy.
* m * #
“Jungle Woman” : The Vienna lady who
was treated for rabies after a bite on the
thigh while bathing in public baths with an
over-ardent swain (B. 17/12/'25) has a
Sydney counterpart. Last year a young
woman strolled into Sydney Hospital
casualty-room for treatment of a shoulder
from which a tidy piece of flesh had been
nipped. She didn’t attempt any equivoca-
tion, but calmly indicated her lover as tne
person responsible, and when the hospital
authorities wanted to sool the police on to
the apparently brutal and ravenous lie-man
she hotly vetoed the idea, remarking that
they had been merely “skylarking m the
park.”
“Black Tracker”: Coober Pedy surely
holds an Australian record for novelty in
town planning. It is situated in a depres-
sion of Stuart’s Range, 184 miles north of
Kingoonya, on the East-West line, and con-
sists of dug-outs in the hillside. At present
it shelters some 30 men, two women, three
young girls and an infant. The dug-outs are
comfortably furnished and divided according
to requirements. It is the “capital” of the
opal fields which extend for miles around
and from which many thousands of pounds’
worth of stone have been gathered. The heat
in summer is very trying and the water

difficulty at times acute. It is run as a
“dry” area, a proposal to establish a hotel
having been turned down. There are several
stores, a post office, eating-house and other
businesses, all housed in 'dug-outs.

RESOLUTIONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The poor old year, long doddering to decay,
Has done its" dash, and got it in the neck;
Has finally, in brief, cashed in its cheque.
Now, what about some Resolutions, heh ?
Resolved; I'll waken with the Convent bill.
A plague on lazy oafs who snooze in bed !
I’ll cut the grass before the dew has fled.
I’ll start next week. To-day I'm not too well.
Resolved: A slave to Nicotine of yore
I’ll limit my cigars to one —or two;
The noisome gasper sternly I’ll taboo.
I’ll finish this one. But I'll smoke no more 1
Resolved: Since anger, as old Horace sings,
Is just short madness raging in the blood,
i’ll be a Stoic.... Damn it, where’s my stud?
Confound those kids, they always take my things!
Resolved: Since truth and truth alone, to speak
And eke to act, is worthy of just men
Matilda, if the gasman calls again
Say I’m away, and won’t be back this week.
Why slide for ever in the same old groove?
Why vegetate ? Awake, arise, old bean!
And ere this year has shuffled from the scene,
Just show the blighters that you can improve !
VICTORIA.
WAWHERESH.


THE FINE POINTS OF THE GAME.
THE HIGH-COL RT REFEREE: “No, dear boy, no knock-outs here. We decide these things on the finer points of the game. Did you notice, for instance, that you haven’t got your hair parted in the middle?”

people, and the pride in its achievements.

“Copabella”: Victoria encourages its
State schools to undertake gardening and
forestry, agriculture and stock-raising, both
as applied sciences and as a means of bring-
ing in a little money, but it is doubtful if it
has achieved anything so lucrative as cer-
tain Queensland schools arc undertaking. In
the Burnett district, where the school-ground
is of suitable soil cane is grown. Successful
centres are Barolin and Gin Gin, near Bun-
daberg. They are mere villages, but their
schools, thanks to the sugar, are in a better
position than many a city one. Barolin
this year harvested 137 tons on its patch of
about five acres. The school-children do some
of the lighter cultivation, but the work is
largely done by co-operative effort and by
“bees” of parents with the necessary
machinery. For harvesting, labor is em-
ployed. It is estimated that a small school
of the type would net £lOO a year from its
patch. If all State schools were as enter-
prising and as fortunately situated, the dif-
ficulties about prize-funds, sports-outfits,
libraries and slielter-sheds would soon be at
an end.
ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF
MATRIMONY.
PARISHIONER (to hen-pecked clergy-
man): “Don’t you think, Mr.
Snuffles, that marriage is a means
of grace?”
MR. SNUFFLES : “ A nything is a means
of grace, Madam, that leads us to
repentance."
“Mudurup”: Rottnest Island, 12 miles
from Fremantle, which the W.A. Govern-
ment hopes some day to make into a health
resort if not a beauty-spot—and there are
possibilities about it, despite the sand and
the glare and the fact that hardly anything
will grow there —has had a chequered his-
tory. In the old days it was a prison for
native convicts —a natural penitentiary, as
it were, something like Sydney’s Pinchgut,
and about the only one that would hold
them. Then big John Forrest sought to
give the place a lift by building a vice-regal
residence there; but no Governor ever cared
much about the marine abode except the
late Admiral (locally known as “Bos’n”)
Bedford, who liked to occupy the place in
the summer and stride about the terrace
with a telescope—like Billy Bones in “Treas-
ure Island.” However, Rottnest was on the
up-grade as a holiday resort for some years
before the war, when it was again employed
for a place of detention, a large crowd of
internees being assembled there until they
were transferred to Liverpool (N.S.W.).
During their occupation they did a vast deal
of damage—there wasn’t much else for them
to do except fish —and on their departure
the. place looked less like a lotusland than
ever. But the Government got busy again,
and Rottnest. although the vice-regal resi-
dence has almost fallen into decay, may yet
live down its past and live up to its future.
There are salt lakes there, the resort of
snipe in season; many years ago the shoot-
ing of these was reserved by Parliament for
the Governor and Ministers of the Crown.
Since then, however, by the irony of fate,
there has never been a Governor who could
hit a snipe or wanted to see if he could, so
the birds have remained unmolested.
“Clerk”: Vic. Railway Commissioner
Clap]) deserves a bouquet for the way he
runs the big dining-room for the workmen at
Newport. For the sum of 3s. Gd. a week the
customer gets five three-course meals, well
cooked and served. The employees elect four
representatives to peruse the monthly balance
sheet and suggest improvements, if they so
desire. Eight hundred men sit down in the
dining-room daily (there is accommodation
for an additional 400), and effective organisa-
tion enables the whole crowd to be fed inside
20 minutes. Among other items, 12 dozen
cabbages, three bags of potatoes, 3601 b. of
meat, 80 gallons of soup and 100 gallons of
tea are disposed of at. one sitting; manager
Easton buys his sugar by the ton and his
eggs in hundred dozens. Clapp reckons that,
even if he doesn’t make a direct profit out of
the rooms, the cheap dinner makes the men
more contented and consequently more effi-
cient.
“Fact” : 1 know another happy couple who
didn’t allow the wedding ceremony to inter-
fere with the daily routine. She was
a Queensland cow-eocky’s daughter; he a
cow-cocky who lived four miles from her
parents’ residence. They were spliced at
noon; at 4 p.m. he cantered home, milked
30 cows, separated, fed the poddies, and
cleaned up again. Then he headed for the.
barn and arrived in time to commence danc-
ing at 8 p.m. When I passed his holding
at 6.30 next morning the pair were busy
teat-pulling and cracking jokes over Straw-
berry’s back.
“Machete” : Queensland, which started the
first itinerant schoolmaster on his long
travels 30 years ago. has always kept a bit
ahead of the other States in educational ex-
periments and reforms. The trains running on
the lines which pierce deep into the heart of
Queensland have periodically included domes-
tic-science cars,' wherein bush girls were
taught many new ways of improving bush
cooking and lightening domestic burdens. Now
a manual-training car is to go out for the
benefit of bush boys who have ambitious
beyond such universal western tools as toma-
hawks and pocket-knives. Working in wood,
sheet-metal and fencing-wire is to be taught,
and boys from the Central Technical High
School at Brisbane will form part of the
car's crew.
* * *
“Burglar's Laborer”: The absence of a
proper apprenticeship leads to a lot of
botched jobs in criminal circles, as in other
walks of life. To some people it might seem
an outsize hit of
bad luck that a
pickpocket, with
the massed occu-
pants of one of
Sydney’s m o s t
crowded bars to
work upon, should
have selected, as
one did the other
day. a plainclothes
policeman for his
professional atten-
tions ; but the well-
trained crook would
never have com-
mitted what was
worse than a crime
—a blunder. The
really conscientious
underworlder makes
a point of becom-
ing acquainted with
the likenesses of
plainclothes men as
Part I of his busi-
ness —the uniform
men don’t so much
matter, although,
of course, it is use-
ful to be able to
recognise them in
civvies. There was
a Sydney magsman
of other days who
managed to escape
detection for a de-
cade. When he was
finally caught he
had in his posses-
sion an album filled
with “snaps” of
his natural ene-
mies ; and attached
to some of the pic-
tures were notes of
personal weak-
nesses or changes,
such as “Likes his
pot,” or “Got a
new pale purple
lid." But that man
was an artist at
his craft; too many
of his successors
are crude amateurs.
“Ben Zine”: The Tommies were not
always the dull fellows they have been pic-
tured. In May, 1016. when we of the tirst
M.L. troops “took over” from the Northum-
berland Fusiliers, I came across the follow-
ing notice nailed on a dug-out off “Spain
Avenue,” Armentieres: —
TO LET OR FOR SALE!
This very desirable property, containing large de-
posits of iron, copper and lead. Owner leaving for
health reasons.
* * * *
“P. O'J.” : Those people who tell of nar-
row escapes don’t always finish the yarn. Too
often the escape isn’t one. Near Pop. in ’l7
a Fritz blundered into the rays of one of
our searchlights and immediately dropped
his eggs. One of the’ bombs —-a dud, it hap-
pened to be—landed in a bell tent between
the heads of two men of a M.L, Field Ambu-
lance. A while after one developed nerves
and couldn’t sleep, and bad things followed ;
the other preferred a nasty death by drink-
ing poison—he couldn’t stand the threaten-
ings from the air any longer. Yet I'll swear
he was as brave a man as the average.
* * * *
“Kir”: Sydney's scanty and scattered
population of over a century ago resorted
to an ingenious expedient to secure the cir-
culation of the few books then in the colony.
A number of leading citizens made out lists
of the volumes in their private libraries and
these lists were then consolidated into a
single inventory. Opposite the title of each
work listed were placed the initials of the
owner on whose shelves it was to be found.
In effect. Australia thus had a library cata-
logue before it had a library; but unfortu-
nately no copy of this precious document
has survived. The scheme was originated in
1821 by Judge Barron Field and Messrs.
Oxley. Goulburn. Berry. Wollstonecraft,
Douglas and Irwin, and constituted the
genesis of the old subscription library.
* * * *
“Caractaeus”: Itecently passed hence in a
northern town a boaster who was perhaps
justly, but certainly mercilessly, punished as
the result of his too-free tongue. He was
neither rabid Pro nor violent Anti during
Conscription days; he was merely an irre-
pressible talker on-all eight cylinders. Some
queer quirk of notoriety-seeking caused him
to put it about that, when a gentle old sep-
tuagenarian Dad had come to the town to
speak for Conscription, he had played some
practical joke on the ancient and made him
look undignified. In cold fact lie had done
nothing of the kind ; but the tale went round,
and it was still in circulation when the sol-
diers began to come back. The first promptly
sought out the alleged humorist and assaulted
him severely. So did the second. Presently
it became the first duty of each returning
Digger to “belt —— out of MeGasbag for
AND NO DOUBT SEE DID.
“What did you hear at the opera, Madge?"
“Oh. that Doris Jones is engaged at last, and that Mrs. Dodge is
carrying on with that Russian fellow.”
“what he done to poor old Dad So-and-So.
Things got so homicidal that the district
magistrate had to take a hand by inflicting a
stiff tine on one of Dad's belated avengers
and hinting at gaol if any more should turn
up. That ended the vendetta, but the victim
for the rest of his life was one of the most
silent of men.
* • * ■* *
“Ilasen" : Lobley was never the man for
forlorn hopes or lost causes. Fat and com-
fortable in body, he had the type of con-
viction that perches on the fence until it
sees which way the tight is likely to go, and
then flings its whole weight on the winning
side, or at any rate the more important and
socially-promising side. Accordingly, when
the argument on prohibition started, Lobley
said nothing until old Gruclier, the richest
and most important man in the club, gave his
decidedly anti-prohibitionist views. Straight-
way Lobley found tongue in whole-hearted
support. “Why,” he wound up, “I regularly
take a glass of stout with meals and a whisky
before going to bed. Far from doing me
harm, I really think it has helped more
than a little to make me the man I am."
And he turned to Gruclier for approval. Old
Grueher plucked thoughtfully at his lips.
“That,” he said at last, “is possibly the
strongest argument I've yet heard —for pro-
hibition !”
* * *■ #
“C.Q.”: The world’s most casual house-
holder has been puzzling Chiltern (Vic.).
Two years ago she vacated her house, leaving
£l5O worth of furniture protected by doors
whose woodwork had so decayed that any
thief could enter without the formality of a
skeleton key. The fixings gradually dwindled
without raising any cry of protest from the
owner, although she got frequent warnings
from the police. When the house was entered
the other day it was found, like the oracle
at Thebes, to be an empty shell.
* * * *
“Brenda’s Son” : Old Ah Chin, who is in
the cabinet-making industry in Melbourne,
was given a month for some offence against
the laws of his adopted country. The owner
of the premises was a little disturbed when
he received the news, and made a bee-line
for the factory to see what was happening
while the boss Chink was withdrawn from
his activity. He was much surprised to see
that worthy working away as usual. “Hullo,
Ah. Chin—how you here?” he asked. Ah
Chin made no bones about it. “Flench pol-
isher, me pay him £lO. He do month—me
too busy.”

Mark the chapter, girl in grey
Sitting in the window seat;
Page on page you’ve turned to-da\
Since we came from Spencer-stieet.
Now we pass the border-town
And the light begins to fail
And the stars are looking down
Through the windows of the mail.
Suddenly, with eyes that shine,
Press the window with your cheek.
Here’s a horseman by the line;
Here’s the road to Sandy Creek!
Yonder , by the rocky ridge,
Sandy Creek is running slow
In the shadow of the bridge
Where one kissed you years ago.
Now you've, travelled far and near,
Heard your other lovers speak.
jr<M there any kiss, my dear.
Like the first at Sandy Creek?
Here’s a face that once you knew
Waiting by the gatehouse light;
Here’s a ghost to follow you
As you travel north to-night.
Shut the window, girl in grey;
Turn the page you cannot see !
Somewhere back along the way,
Lost awhile in reverie
Or by whisky overcome—
Solace that a man may seek —-
Drunk or weary, riding home,
Goes the man from Sandy Greek!

One of the pioneer breed, Alfred Richard
Outtrim, of Maryborough (Vic.), just missed
another haggis. In 1854, as a Scotch boy
under 10 years of age, he landed in Aus-
tralia in the midst of the gold rush. Two
years previotisly N. S. Wales had sent to Lon-
don, packed in the hold of a small vessel, two
tons of gold. Young Alf found a place as
a butcher’s boy, but craved for something
more exciting and became a driver of one of
Cobb’s coaches, a life full of danger and
adventure in those days. Then he turned
grocer and established himself ,in Mary-
borough ; and after that he was an auc-
tioneer and went to Parliament, where, but
for two years’ break, he hold a seat; for
25 years continuously and office as a Minister
repeatedly.
An energetic young man is Charles
Edward Chuter, of the Queensland Home
Department. He is Assistant Under-
Sec. to Stopford, and has charge of local
government and many other affairs. Chuter
had a lot to do with drafting the Greater
Brisbane scheme; he was returning-oflicer at
the first elections, and runner-up for the
town clerkship. As
a consolation prize
he may be ap-
pointed chairman of
the proposed Local
Government Com-
mission. One of his
outside jobs is to
lead the Govern-
ment delegation on
the Hospital Board.
It is sometimes
said that he is the
Board, and he isn’t
the man to deny
the soft impeach-
ment.

in a hospital has already Teft blanks in her
legislative diary. Rumor says she will have
a number of opponents in next selection
ballot, but she will have the advantage of
practically a block vote from women mem-
bers of the A.L.P.
Life has been a variegated business for
Ashley Howard Teece, Melbourne Hospital’s
new secretary and superintendent. A pro-
duct of Sydney Grammar and University, he
began life in an insurance office, became a
shepherd in the Congregational fold, marched
to the late war as a chaplain with the Light
Horse and returned to be deputy-chairman
of the Repat. Commission, a job he got by
nomination from soldiers all over the Com-
monwealth, who recognised a good man when
they saw him. Richard Teece, who was for
30 years g.m. and actuary of the A.M.P.,
fathered him.
Labor men jeer at Bruce’s spats, but —
When Alf Jones, Queensland’s Minister of
Mines, was representing his State at the
Wembley Exhibition, he turned out in great
style; but Theodore, on inspecting him, found
something lacking. “You can’t go along luce
that, Alf,” he said disapprovingly. “Don't
you know the Prince is coming? You must
wear spats.” So Alf went out and bought,
spats and made his personal attendants do
likewise. There were more spats about the
Queensland pavilion that afternoon than any-
where else at Wembley. Theodore didn't
wear any—he said he had forgotten them,
and Jones has a dark suspicion that his old
chief put up a joke on him.
Launceston’s new Digger-Mayor, Major A.
A. Evans, D. 5.0., saw service in South
Africa as well as Europe. A good runner
and cyclist in the pre-war days, he is now
secretary of half the sporting clubs in the
locality, and has just been appointed starter
to the T.T.C. His
grandfather, Fran-
cis Evans, was for
a long while an
alderman, and his
father, Alex.
Evans, was for
donkey’s years
Warden of the
Marine Board and
Master Warden
more often than
anyone before or
since, so that run-
ning for office is a
family habit.
M. A. DAVIDSON,
Labor Member for
Sturt ( N.S.W .)
and Government
Whip.
“W. Ally”: I encountered the gent, who
claims descent from the Doges of Venice (B.
3/12/’25) at Claremont (W.A.) last Show
Day. Locally this scion of an ancient line
is known as the Count, and keeps the wolf
from the door by hawking cigars. He was
at the ticket wundow at the railway station
and attracted some attention by announcing
loudly: “To-morrow is my birthday; from
to-day, and every day henceforth, I travel
first class. One first-class single West
Perth.” After getting his ticket he informed
two black gins dowm for the Show that he
was a direct descendant of Napoleon 1.,
but the only comment elicited by the assur-
ance was “Go ’way, me good girl”—from
the more personable of the pair.
A trio of relatives of N.S.W. Labor Par-
liamentarians figure among the 25 appointed
by Lang to the Upper House. J. Hoad is
father of Ken Hoad, one-time railway porter
and now M.L.A. for Cootamundra; he has
served 34 of his three-score years as an aider-
man at .Tunec and has been Mayor 11 times.
James Mark Minahan, like his brother Pat,
that stormy little capitalist who w r as twice
expelled, twice taken back to the fold, and
now is a Sydney member, is a boot manu-
facturer. He has reached the half-century,
was once in the Government Printing Office
and has practically no political record. Jack
Keegan owns the same father as Tom of that
ilk w r ho sits as one of the Balmain five in the
Lowrnr House. A Labor pioneer of the 1890
vintage, Jack Keegan was active on the
Barrier in the days of Sleath and Ferguson.
He also figured prominently at Wyalong and
in the North and helped Holman to gain his
political spurs. His reward comes late in
life. A relation who just missed a gold pass
was R. F. Stuart-Robertson, Sydney solicitor
and son of R. J. Stuart-Robertson, M.L.A.
The Graveyard, which is the name King
Island, in Bass Strait, goes by amongst sea-
faring men, buried William Hickmott, its
oldest inhabitant, the other day. Hickmott
sought the island 63 years ago on the ad-
vice of a shipwrecked sailor, and himself saw
27 of the 40 marine disasters the bit of
rock is famous for. In rescue work he was
often conspicuous, and thereby earned the
thanks of the Tasmanian Government.
One of the busiest men in Melbourne these
days is ,T. C. Boyce, head of Vic.’s tourist office.
In 18S8 he was put in charge of a small in-
quiry box at Spencer-street, and his sole
receipts w T ere questions. To-day he has 22
myrmidons in a big suite in Queen's-walk,
and handles an annual turnover of half a
million. Boyce does not regard his office as
a glorified ticket-selling agency. His forte is
to act as guide and courier to all Australia,
and questions about pigs and poultry are
answered as readily as inquiries about
scenery. There is only one individual he
hates worse than the official who takes bribes,
and that is the man who offers them. One
such had learnt the efficiency of cumshaw
in other centres, and automatically included an
extra half-note in his payment for an early
booking. He hasn’t yet got over his pained
surprise at being introduced by the con-
scientious clerk to Mr. Boyce and the
fatherly address on the evils of nepotism
that was given him.
When Thomas Mather crossed the bar at
75 Hobart lost one of its most useful and
philanthropic citizens who had devoted him-
self, heart and soul, to the welfare of youth
as well as age. For 40 years he had been
chairman of the Benevolent Society, founded
by his father —‘founder also of the firm of
Andrew Mather and Co. Thomas Mather
was also chairman and governor of the
Kennerley Boys’ Home, and for 35 years had
been secretary of the Homoeopathic Hospital.
He was a pillar of the Friends (Quaker)
Society, and devoted much time to the man-
agement of Friends’ High School, of which
he was treasurer.
The trouble about these Labor M’s.L.C. is
that they won’t stay put. There probably
isn’t a case on record of a non-Labor nomi-
nee turning Labor; but there are plenty of
men who have gone up Labor and come
down Tory. In the last N.S.W. batch or co-
hort is included a young man from the Labor
Truth at Broken Hill. But he isn’t the
first. Thirty years ago a studious young
wheelwright named Nicky Buzaeott kept
the then-weekly Broken Hill Truth going
with contributions; and as the party hadn’t
any money to pay him with, and as Nicky
wanted to go to Sydney, they made an M.L.C.
of him. He voted Labor, as he was expected
to, for 20 years or more ; then he gradually
drifted, and it was partly to counterbalance
him and other “backsliders” that Lang de-
manded a quarter-hundred new members the
other day.
When John Mathieson was sole Railway
Commissioner in Vic. he made the mistake
of showing that he took A. R. Outtrim for a
simpleton. So when Outtrim became Minis-
ter for Railways in the McLean Government
(1599-1900) he had to teach Mathieson a
lesson. Feeling his way, the Minister sug-
gested the transfer of a non-existing railway
employee from one place to another. Mathie-
son replied to the effect that that was a mat-
ter for himself, and, in so many words, hinted
that the amended Act made the Minister a
sort of rubber-stamp. “And what are these?’’
queried Outtrim, pleasantly, pointing to a
bundle of papers Mathieson had placed be-
fore him. “Just formal,” replied Mathieson :
“they require merely your signature as Min-
ister for Railways.” “Do they involve the
spending of any money?” inquired Outtrim.
Mathieson, now feeling uncomfortable,
admitted that they did. “Then,” said A.R.,
“I’ll have to study them to obey the order of
the Treasurer [Sliiels], who is a fair terror
on economy.” He pretended to study them
for two days. Mathieson then came along
and capitulated. He suggested a fresh start
without discussing “spheres” of administra-
tive activity. Outtrim agreed, and the way
those papers were then polished off was mar-
vellous. After that the two never clashed.
Among the caucus selection of nominees
for the N. S. Wales Leg. Council, and well
up in the ballot, was J. O’Dea, tactfully
described by the Labor Daily as a “boot-
maker,” but by less squeamish journals as a
bookmaker; When the appointments were
made it was discovered that O’Dea had been
left out and W. E. Dickson, of Barrier
Truth, 26th on the caucus ballot list, given
his place. The bilked bookie hastened to
tell the capitalist press that a “large sport-
ing section” would forthwith detach itself
from Labor as a result of the affront offered
to a high priest of the punting cult, and pro-
fessed himself utterly unable to imagine
what Mr. Lang could have been thinking
about. “It may be,” he is reported to have
said, that he was prejudiced against my
calling,” but Mr. O’Dea didn’t think that
at all a likely explanation. The Labor or-
ganisations at Broken Hill have also reproved
Lang for appointing Dickson, who is termed
“an unknown man,” though he has been
managing the local Labor paper for eight
years.
Some people scented a first-class musical
sensation when they recognised in the young
vorticist of the piano who has recently been
holding recitals in Melbourne, not Paris de
Chaumente, the French-born infant prodigy
who, according to the programme, had played
before the Czar and sat ’at the feet of the
great Godowsky, but Eric Jackson, of Syd-
ney, w T hom Sydney’s own Godfrey Smith
could claim as pupil. Both stories happen
to be true. The Gallic-looking youth teas
born in Paris, and his father was a French-
man. It was his Sydney stepfather who bore
the name of Jackson. How much the young
““ owe | t? Gotlowsky and how much to
Uodtrey Smith, however, isn’t clear. Per-
haps if he had advertised his Australian
antecedents as well as his French, the critics
would have been nicer to him, and his show
wouldn t have come to such an abrupt con-
clusion The number of people who are pre-
pared to give an Australian or even a half-
or quarter-Australian his dues isn’t increas-
ing as rapidly as it should; but it is increas-
ing.
BERNARD THOMAS HEINZE, the new
Ormond Professor of Music and Direct-
tor of the University Conservatorium,
Melbourne.
Since the defeat of “,Tupp” Gardiner for
the Senate George Black, M.L.C., is the sole
survivor in active politics of the 30 Labor-
ites returned to the N.S.W. Parliament in
1891. Black, who will be 72 next February,
was born in Edinburgh; West Sydney took
him out of a sub-editor’s chair in the Bul-
letin office, his talking-shop colleagues being
Tom Davis, ,T. D. Fitzgerald and Andy Kelly.
After dropping out of politics for a dozen
years he went back as Namoi’s representative
and held various ministerial posts under
Holman during the early years of the war,
becoming one of the Lords in the year before
the Armistice.
One of the ablest young men behind the.
Federal Labor scenes is Eric Tonkin, born
in Adelaide 32 years ago, who since 1918 lias
been secretary to Senator Gardiner, and
directed Labor’s publicity campaign during
the elections. He has plenty of organising
ability and an encyclopaedic knowledge of
politics, but his style was cramped in the
last campaign by the duds the Cause had to
carry. Tonkin entered the S.A. Public
Works Department when John Verran was
Premier, and before becoming Gardiner’s
white-headed boy was in the other camp as
secretary to Senator E. D. Milieu. Probably
his next allegiance will be to Needham,
who is tipped as Gardiner’s successor as
A.L.P. leader in the Senate.
Arthur Yagei’, one of Lang’s Fivc-and-
twenty, is known far and wide as secretary
of the Sydney Eight-Hour Art Union. A
foundation member of the Wickerworkers’
Union, he was formerly treasurer and presi-
dent of that body, and was its Wages Board
representative for years. Despite his many
jobs he has managed to sandwich in a fair
amount of sport, and is closely connected
with the Athletic League, the Harbor Sailing
Club and the Rugby League.
An unusual romance is linked with the
name of the just-dead Lieut.-Col. Paul. When
quite a young man in Bathurst (N.S.W.)
he unsuccessfully wooed a girl whose
daughter he married over a score of years
later. Mrs. Paul, who died nine years ago,
was an artist. She once stood as a Socialist
candidate for Cook.
“Bris” : Edward Vincent, known in Bris-
bane as “the Rat King,’’ has been appointed
chief ratcatcher to the City Council at a
salary of £6OO a year. It may seem high
pay, but Vincent has been earning much
more as a freelance, catching rats on a
capitation basis (Is. a head for rats; Id.
for mice). A bag of 100 rats is a fair day’s
work for him ; his record is over 300. The
City Council alone has been paying him
more than the salary; in addition he holds
retainers from many firms, and is occasion-
ally called far afield (like the Pied Piper)
to rid country towns of their vermin. Hither-
to he has worked singlehanded, with only
dogs and ferrets as assistants, but as Rat-
catcher Extraordinary to the council he will
be the chief of a unit. At present ratcatch-
ing costs the council £11,500 a year; under
the new system the council expects to have
more rats to show for much less money.
The Father of the Leg. Council of N. S.
Wales is Dr. J. M. Creed, appointed by the
Stuart Ministry in 1885. The runner-up is
li. E. Kater, appointed by the Dibbs Min-
istry in 1889.
A NEW YEAR PETITION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lord, if Thou have regard of me,
Thy creature built to pleasure Thee,
Give me not peace but give me fire
To press and battle and aspire,
To shun soft ease and scorn repose,
And win my virtue from my foes,
And when I fall let it be said:
“He did not die till he was dead;
He had no time to doff his gear,
Within his hand he held his spear;
His soul passed through the door—was gone—
But, Lord, his boots were truly on!”
The Devil heard and grinned and said:
“For such we’ve neither board nor bed.
Nor burning pool nor grid nor grill,
Nor coal to spare nor oil to spill;
Whoever built him, blood and bone,
The Lord may claim him for His own.”
QUEENSLAND.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“.T.T.D.”: To anyone inclined to accept
“Mephisto’s” statement (B. 17/12/ - ’2f>) that the
hand may be dipped for a moment into molten lead
if it has been first plunged into water, I would say
“Don’t.” The only metal known to science that will
stand this operation is quick-silver. If a wet hand
were plunged into molten metal, the explosion
caused by the moisture getting below the surface
would probably shatter the hand, and shower the
fool who owned it with the hot liquid. T have on
numerous occasions plunged a finger into molten
metal without injury, owing to the fact that the
natural oil of the body is a protection, also that a_
vacuum is created and the surface of the metal
is not broken —but don’t forget to lift your finger
out!
“Sucre”: In reply to “Returned Empty”
(B, 10/12/’25), the ligature in snakebite cases can
and should be removed when bleeding has ceased
from the scarifications of the knife. His friend who
suffered for two weeks after the ligature was re-
movpd was probably a sufferer from rheumatism.
* * * *
“8.T,” : I have heard of and seen extra-
ordinary happenings brought about by the “magic”
practised by the blacks, such as pointing the bone,
but in every such case in the past the part ics
affected were members of some abo. tribe. The experi-
ences of a Sister of the mission at Oodnadatta
(S.A.) extend the influence to whites. She had
occasion to reprimand a member of a tribe for
disobedience, and her act was secretly resented by
him. lie, no doubt, referred the matter to the
members of his tribe camped in the vicinity and
enlisted their sympathy. A muster of men and
women was made at a spot midway between the
camp and the mission station, and, at a signal, all
started to beat the ground with sticks and sing
the same song in a weird crooning. The noise
was continuous, rising and falling in a most un-
canny manner, until the atmosphere and ground
appeared to be charged with electricity. The effect,
according to the Sister, was such that the earthen
kitchen floor eoold not be used. (The wooden floors
in the other rooms were not affected.) The lady
under these conditions began to suffer in health,
but the man who was responsible for the trouble
died a few days later and the phenomenon thereupon
immediately ceased.
* * * *
“Hylaeola”: The suggestion by “J.H.” (P>.
10/12/’25) that sanctuaries should be created in
N.Q. for bower-birds and other unique creatures is
belated. N.Q. has at least a dozen sanctuaries for
native fauna, one of whieli —the great National Park
at Bellenden Her —is probably the largest of its
kind in Australia; it covers about 100,000 acres.
“J.H.” admires the bower-bird’s mimicry, but, clever
as it is, I doubt whether it attains the amazing
skill of the lyre-bird. There are half a dozen
smaller birds that excel as mimetic vocalists, and
they do not merely borrow notes but weave the
stolen goods into the woof of their own melody.
* * * *
“X.Y.Z.”: Many people are sceptical as
to the influence of -the pawpaw-tree on human
beings, but I can vouch
for the following. In
the days of black labor
in the N.Q, canefields a.
couple of house-servants
built their own little room
in the garden close to a
fine pawpaw-tree which
every year had long
strings of blossoms, but
bore no fruit. A week or
two after they had taken
possession of their new room
they asked if they might
move from it. “We two
feller,” . said the wife,
“no like ’em that place;
we altogether too much
sick and tired longa
morning.” Of course we
laughed at the story and
disbelieved it. However,
the couple left the room
for another which was de-
clared to be all right.
Some weeks later when
Dr. Bancroft happened to
bo dining with us I toid
him the story and took
him to the room. When
I mentioned that it was
overshadowed by a fine
pawpaw-tree he remarked:
“Probably that is the
explanation.” Directly he
saw the tree he seemed
convinced of it being so,
and said; “This is a male
tree, and you have no other
in the garden. I’ll send
you a mate for it, and
there will be no further
trouble.” This subse-
quently he did, sending
us a female tree from the
Brisbane gardens, and we
planted it close to the
other. Finally, to test the theory, I persuaded the
Kanakas to return to it, and there was never after-
wards any complaint.
“Te Babarantiko”: “Is that so?” said the wife
after perusing “Moe’s” remarks (B. 10/12/’25).
“I never heard of any belief, firm or otherwise, in
North Queensland, or elsewhere in the tropics, about
the effect of pawpaw-trees on sleepers. At Gordon-
vale, 14 miles back of Cairns, we slept for months
with pawpaws flowering and fruiting against our
bedroom window and suffered no annoyance beyond
flying-foxes whining and fighting for the fruit, and
an old horse crunching and munching the ground-
falls all night outside the window. We had paw-
paws close enough at Meringa, too, and at Towns-
ville they grew all around our house, and nothing
happened. There was ‘general lassitude and weari-
ness’ enough and to spare in the North, but I never
heard it blamed on pawpaws. At Tabwewa, up
under the equator, in the Central Pacific, we had
the only pawpaws—flowering and fruiting, too —leit
alive after a long drought, night against, our
verandah, but 1 can’t think of anything happening
to blame the pawpaws for.”

“Parama”: The New Guinea buck is an
imposing gentleman when dressed for parade or some
other special occasion.
He starts the toilet by
anointing his person
from head to foot with
nnclarified pig - fat.
His hair is then plaited
into numerous small
tufts interwoven with
feathers and grass, the
whole sticking upright
from the head. Into
the perforation in each
nostril he inserts an
alligator tusk (these
adornments point, up-
wards and reach
almost to tiie eyes) and
through the cartilage
he fits a piece of
polished bone 9in. long.
The rings of flesh that
form the lobes of his
ears are hung with
goanna-elaws, scraps
of pig-flesh, finger-
bones and dogs’ teeth,
the whole sagging down
to his shoulders. His
waist is compressed by
a plaited grass string,
though in some cases
this gives [dace to a
five-inch belt of the
same material. Plaited
cane bands are drawn
tightly round his
arms above the elbows,
and his left forearm,
from wrist to elbow, is
covered with a sheath
made of cane or glass
plaited and woven, as
a guard against the
friction of the cane
bow-string. He car-
ries his six-foot bow
and a bundle of mixed
arrows. Two cane or
grass rings below' his
knees complete hi s
uniform. So attired
lie is a proud man, and
after dancing and pos-
turing violently, to
show' off his points,
stands glistening in
the sun with sweat- and
grease-covered body.
At such times it is as
well to keep to wind-
ward of him.
‘‘Cog”: If the sea-snake is as deadly as
“Tamornie” contends (B. 10/12/’25), I witnessed
a fine illustration of “drunk’s luck” in the Sand-
gate (Q.) sea-baths. A green sea-snake had found
its way into thg enclosure and caused an immediate
rush for the stairways. The only bather who de-
clined to be stampeded was a partially sozzled
person who sidled up to where the snake was
swimming and, after a dozen ineffectual attempts,
grabbed it by the middle. Then he apparently
became panic-stricken at his own daring, and
whirling his capture aloft began to flail the water,
the fencing and his own hack with his squirming
captive. Finally he flung it from him, and the five
feet of snake fell, headless and tailless, among the
crowd on the jetty. The performer, whose back
looked as if he had undergone a flogging, drank
half a bottle of whisky before he would consent to
enter the ambulance which took him home. I
•expect he still wears the marks of his prowess.
“11.N.D.” : I rush to aid “Jimmy Fossuin”
(B. 3/12/’25) in ridding his house of ants. Get
six penn’orth of powdered borax and mix it with a
small quantity of honey. Give the crawlers a liberal
supply and don’t judge too hastily; it takes some
time to do the trick, but I stake my reputation
that it’ll be a success.
* * * *
“Ibn cl Issar”: Dates in the countries
which grow them for export are all hand fertilised
(B. 10/12/’2f>). Even the palms in the arid wastes
of Sinai are carefully attended to in the season,
Bedouin owners travelling from hod to hod, and
youths climbing each female tree in a grove of per-
haps many hundreds, and fertilising each in turn
with the male flowers. The palms are not left to
chance either. Every hod has its seedling bed, and
from these the young trees are transferred in season
to deep circular pits in the sand, at the bottom of
which they are planted. Many a farmer in the
Light Horse picked up some useful tips on date-
cultivation from the Bedouin.,
“Griffith Moses": “T.P." thinks (B.
31/12/25) that “to stop the slaughter of protected
nathe fauna the receivers must be squelched....
gaol without the option,’’ etc. I am a groat believer
in the native fauna, and am the father of four of
them myself; still it seems possible to be Too
Precipitate in the matter. Consider, for instance,
the emu. It is one of this bird’s ambitions to make
a beast of itself on the fruit of the pricklv-pear.
Having fully lunched, the flock starts on the run
to promote digestion, and presently runs into a
rabbit-proof fence, probably with infested land on
one side and nearly clean country on the other. Quite
a number of useless fowl contrive to get caught by
the toe, turn a somersault over the fence, and hang
there, kicking furiously and discoursing like devils.
Presently much fence comes down, and they extricate
DOUBLE TROUBLE.
“You don't look too ’appy, Bill.”
“No, carn’t 'elp it —on top of me accident the wife's gone an’ got
twins.”
"Never mind, you'll have your compensation from the insurance
company.”
“Yes, hut the wife’s got that too!”
themselves, and depart at accelerated pace. With
a speed which defies description the news goes round
by wireless rabbitgram and dingogram that the way
to good pasture is open, and before • the break is
discovered it is quite possible for the work of months
to be undone. Meanwhile the emu is far away per-
forming natural functions which sow more prickly-
pear all over the landscape, and its wife is prob-
ably laying 16 eggs so as to supply more emus. On
these eggs, when found, the squatter and his minions
step with enthusiasm.

“Gamaoho”: W. R. Humphries, Resident
Magistrate at Kerema, in the Gulf of Papua, and
author of “Patrolling in Papua,” has been busy
with the warriors of the wandering tribe of Kukuku-
kus since taking over control of his division. Twelve
months ago he tackled the jungle men, and finished
a case that had been on the waiting list for two
years. On that occasion he brought in his prisoners
after a hard scrap in the rough ranges behind Kere-
ma. Last month the tribe ventured down to the
coast, 23 miles west of the Government station, Where
they raided the Vailala village and killed six natives
before decamping. A patrol-officer gave hot chase,
but secured only one prisoner. Humphries, not
satisfied, took up the job, but when I left, three
weeks ago, hadn’t made a satisfactory clean-up of
the affair. But he will not see the law flouted,
even if the Kukukukus take him for a second trip
across the interior.

“Bunya” : The great wandering albatross
is invariably claimed in the text-books as an Aus-
tralasian bird; but I have seen the giant hundreds
of miles north of the equator in the Pacific. Aus-
tralians also usually claim the penguin as their
very own, but I have seen large colonies of these
awkward birds on the rocks and sandbanks on both
sides of South America, ' and have photographed
them there more than once.

THE PLACE BETWEEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He smelt of streets and endless roads,
And gutter growths and trees,
Of harvest horses with their loads,
And city beer and cheese.
He had the walk of one who knows
Both tram and saddle seat,
The voice of one wlio’d found the close
Of many books and known the woes
Of sheep too poor to bleat.
Perhaps it was because of this
That'Peter let him in
To wander in the Land of Bliss
He’d never hoped to win.
A sad mistake, but even he
Who guards the golden gate
Might be excused that he should see
In such a one the kind of pea
Who swells the Sunday plate.
They showed him marble founts and halls
And hills of golden gleams,
The rivers and the waterfalls
And silver, singing streams,
The cold white pillars of the trees
And all the splendid rest—
And he, he muttered, “Blast my knees,
We’d better than the best of these
In our land —Further West!”
They waste no time in Kingdom Come.
He dropped a week and fell
And sprained the red imp’s horny thumb
Who caught him down in Hell.
He found the coals of furnace five
Were zero warmth or less;
And Satan gaped to see him thrive
And turned him loose to walk alive
About the wilderness.
He saw the skulls and broken bones,
The grassless, cracking earth;
He heard the damned things’ bitter moans,
And hidden devils’ mirth.
He drew hot air into his chest
And Hell rocked with his roar:
“I’ve seen the lot of this out west:
It’s damn bad form to show a guest
What he has seen before.”
A PINT IN THE HAND, ETC.
FIRST NAVVY : “If th ’ foreman asked yer to 'are a. drink with
’im, would yer?”
SECOND NAVVY: “I might, hut I wouldn't enjoy it th’ same as
if you asked me.”
Three days from Heaven and three from Hell
He dwells where he was. thrust.
He looks on Heaven and says “Ah, well!”
On Hell and says “I’m bust!”
He knows that sadder folk there be
Among both damned and blest—-
That only one midway may see,
’Twixt splendor and cold misery,
The heart of God—the West.

ESSEX TOURING
The largest sales of 6-cylinder
cars simply reflect the general
recognition of greatest car value.
But it is important to note how
this position of leadership gives
Essex advantages in continually
improving value to the buyer—
because of volume economy in
purchase of materials, manufac-
turing savings, and low cost of
distribution.
Built on the Super-Six principle,
the patents which account for
Hudson’s famous reliability, bril-
liant performance and long life
are responsible for the same
qualities in Essex. It is the easiest
riding and steering Essex ever
built—the finest in performance,
appearance and workmanship.
We believe it is the most economi-
cal car in the world to own and
operate. Its economy consists not
only in low first cost and operation
expense, but, more important, in
freedom from repair expense, the
low cost of repair parts when
necessary/ and long car life.
Now it holds the greatest price
advantage with the finest quality
Essex ever offered.

“Jane”: “M.G.” says (B. 26/11/’25) that
brolgas, or native companions, hold their cor-
roborees at sunrise only. I do not know much
about sunrise, but I do know that they dance
out here (N.-W.Q.) at any time of the day between
the months of July and November. Last week I
saw eight of them bowing, pirouetting and curtseying
with outspread wings in a rhythmical dance, and
the time was then noon, with the temperature lOldeg.
in a very shady shade.
* * * *
“1.L.1.”: There appears to be some doubt
in “Oakabella’s” mind (B. 3/12/’25) about N.
Queenslanders hunting wild pigs for meat. In the
coastal jungle areas they have done so for 50
years, from Cairns up, and especially back from
Cooktown. The tin-miners have been salting the
swine down for as many years as I can remember.
No doubt the N.Q. animals’ lives are cast in un-
commonly pleasant places; they have the rich
tropical jungle to live upon, and thus keep in good
condition.
* * * *
“Emel”: It is intelligible that the
“jumart,” mentioned by “Herodot” (B. 19/11/’25),
should display the diverse characteristics of its two
parents; but why should the offspring of a Jersey
bull and a Jersey cow, both purebred, show marked
equine traits? The animal was bred at Mooral
Creek, near Wingham (Vic.), and has high withers,
with a dip in the back, a near hindleg shaped
like a horse’s, and a short bushy tail. When feeding,
it resembles a horse from the rear; from the front
it is unmistakably a cow, and its horns are be-
ginning to grow. It runs with a leg action similar
to that of a horse cantering.
* * * *
“ J.M.C.” : I endorse all “Xamilc” says (B.
3/'l2/’25) re the crow, and suggest the following
method of warfare by which I have saved the lives
of thousands of sheep and lambs. In a lambing
paddock lay flat out on the ground three or four
dead crows; if they can be laid Where the sheep
A SHAME TO WASTE IT.
“Gripes, Bill, wot a lovely ’cad to ’it with a bottle!”
usually run, all the better. Unless the paddock is
of very great extent, one bird laid well in from
each corner will insure that no lamb or ewe will be
touched. Each dead crow must be shifted every day.
Hanging them in a conspicuous place is of no
avail. One set of crows will do for a whole lambing
season. I have by using the above method been
able for 25 years past to save the lives of thousands
of bogged sheep without one losing an eye—as long as
I did not neglect to shift the dead crows from their
resting-place of the day before. The crow is as
cowardly as he is cunning, and looks on a crow in
a fresh place each day as freshly dead, and won't
touch anything in its neighborhood.
* * * #
“N.T.” : In 1912 two fellows disembarked
from a lugger at Anson Bay. They were about
30 miles below the mouth of the Daly, and had
heard weird yarns of the myall blacks there. So when,
while landing their stores, they were suddenly faced
with a mob of naked savages all armed with long
poles and all yelling and shrieking in different keys,
these two men grabbed guns and revolvers, prepared
to sell their lives dearly. At sight of the firearms
the natives withdrew to the bush again. The heroes
were just congratulating themselves on their presence
of mind when back came the horde, this time with
a white woman among them. And the wildest, most
ferocious-looking savage of the lot was carrying
her six-months-old baby! The two white men had
visions of a rescue, only to find that the woman had
been living at Anson Bay for some considerable time,
and that she was, as her husband said when he came
back from his day’s shooting, “having the time of
her life.” The “wild myalls” had merely come down
to help the white men unload their goods, and were
highly indignant at being met with levelled guns
instead of the welcome that they expected.
* * * *
“Up North”: Binglii is coldly vindictive.
As he mumbles over the death-bone his wishes
lack nothing in malice. A few of his printable hopes
are: “May scorpions eat your kidnej's for many moons,
then your liver, then your heart. May your eyes
turn inwards and your tongue swell until it bursts
your head.” Occasionally, to put vim into his
enemy’s passing, he gives him the “snake-death.”
This is merely the dried fangs of a black snake
fastened with human hair to the bone when it is
pointed. But the effect on the victim is dreadful.
The news is whispered to him, and instantly he feels
the fangs of the snake in his kidneys. I have never
heard of a nigger recovering when this has happened
to him.
* * * *
“Avon” : Joseph Farington, an early nine-
teenth-century artist whose “Diary” is just pub-
lished after having lain in storage for a hundred
years, complained that the “lower classes” of his
period were over-fastidious in that they refused to
eat hake, albeit it was cheap and most people re-
garded it as palatable. Which reminds me that
years ago, when the question of acclimatising perch
and other coarse fish from British fresh waters was
being discussed by the Westralian Assembly, a mem-
ber amused the House by reading an extract from
an old English book which commended the tench,
though a fish that offered little sport and was
somewhat tasteless on the table, as “an admirable
food for the poorer classes.” I never tasted hake,
but if the tench of English rivers deserves this testi-
monial it adds another bitterness to poverty, for it
consists mainly of insipid flesh and tiny bones. How-
ever, the question of whether anybody would appre-
ciate it in W.A. has probably never arisen, for
although I believe three or four kinds of coarse fish
were put down in brooks and reservoirs the English
perch was the only one that flourished. The perch grows
to a huge size in its new environment and gives
excellent sport. Also, it makBs tolerable eating,
which is more than can be said for tench, roach,
dace, chub and other fish that Izaak Walton wrote
about.
* * # *
“Black Tracker” : The common black, big-
bellied spider is not
generally looked upon
as an artistic web-
builder, for its house
is not much to look
at, yet it is a veritable
silk-factory. For one
thing, it has a most
delicately - constructed
carding machine,
capable of producing
any size of thread re-
Close to the
spinneret is a sieve of
different grades
through which the
threads are passed.
When strong threads,
such as those used for
guys, are needed, they
are turned out with a
smooth, hard surface,
but when the finer
varieties are produced
they are subjected to
a teasing process
worked by fine-tooth
combs fixed on the
second joint of the
hind legs. When suffi-
ciently ruffled the
threads are coated
with a sticky sub-
stance so that the
wings of victims will
be rendered powerless.
As a weaver this fellow
is not the best; never-
theless the fine threads will be found to be’worked
in with remarkable precision.
* * * *
“Parama”: I called in at one of the Torres
Strait islands recently for water, and while the
“boys” were filling up I paid a visit to the native
school at tlie invitation of the Gum’ment teacher.
School was on, and for my edification the class
was put through its paces. The best of the per-
formance came last, when, all standing, the entire
school gave their version of “The Star-crossed Flag
of Australia.” They opened their mouths wide, and
in the shrillest of voices let go what sounded like
this:—
Des a laan in des saan,
Ob moseaan ’n dessie,
Widder kindon ob glor yarlaan too,
Se clam stardie arn,
Maam un salors bred,
Cry in ma eudat,
Cryin in da sea,
Star-cross fag ob Esstra-a-a-lia.
They sang it, too, as though they believed every
word of it.
“Michael Earle” (Vancouver, 8.C.) : The
kangaroo dinosaur becomes better known through,
the explorations of Dr. Roy Andrews, the American
scientist, in the Gobi Desert, where, he claims, the
origin of all life was. It is, he says, the most in-
credible of all the prehistoric animals. Thirty feet

long, with a head-clearance of 15ft., its leaps were
about 50ft. in length and twice as high as its head.
The gorgosaur—that is its scientific name —was
indigenous to all climates and countries, and girdled
the globe in the days when there were land-bridges
connecting Asia with Australia and America. Its
speed was from 60 to 100 miles an hour, and its
action was the same as that of the modern kangaroo.
No other species approached it in speed. Fossils
of the gorgosaur have been found in America, Europe
and Africa, and their recent discovery in Asia fur-
nishes the last link in the chain of their wanderings
over th" globe.
* * * *
“Tarago”: I can settle tlie argument as
to whether Mrs, Coach Whip assists her hubby in the
familiar call. I was pushing through a dense
patch of scrub t’other day, when the lady herself
hopped up on a twig and disputed my right-of-way.
She was very angry, clucking and scolding at me
till she shook with rage. As I stood gazing at her,
not 12ft. away, hubby, whom I had not noticed
before, remarked; “We-e-e-e-e whht wee-pee,” from
a branch just below her. That’s as near as I can
get in type to the sound of the full call, and he did
it all himself.
* * * *
“Tarago” : A stranger to these shores who
has become acclimatised enough to penetrate bush
districts is the English thrush. The pioneer in our
neighborhood met with a violent death owing to his
species not being recognised ; hence this par. The Eng-
lish thrush is a mottled brown bird, marked not unlike
a quail, but a deeper brown in color; the tail is
like that of a parrot, and is longer than the body;
the head is broad, and is inclined to be flat as
it comes down towards a sharp beak. In size the
newcomer is larger than the native thrush, with a
plump, quail-like body. The bird which was brought
to me for identification was the first I have seen
in this country ; the slayer had never before had an
opportunity of seeing one anywhere.
* * * *
“Phil Anthus”: “M.G.” (B. 10/12/’25)
confuses Gerygone cantator, the mangrove warbler
of Queensland, with the white-throated warbler (the
accepted “bush-canary”) and the yellow-tailed tit.
It is the latter bird, and not the warbler, that
builds a double-decked nest; and to suggest that this
is done for the benefit of the goanna is merely
foolish. No slim snake, much less a bulky goanna,
could ever get to the flimsy branchlets in which
these tiny birds suspend their homes. The most
feasible idea regarding that upper storey is that
it is for the accommodation of the male bird. For
another thing, little cantator is certainly not the
smallest bird in Australia. That distinction belongs
to the short-billed tree-tit.
* * •* *
“Rob” : “M.K.C.” writes of a fine avenue
of date-palms in the main street of Echuca (Vic.).
He is in error; the trees are the Phoenix canariensis
variety, an ornamental, and not a fruiting, palm.
We can grow large plants from the date-stone, but
they never fruit.
* * * *
“Rmia”: Something like a snapper was
brought up by one of the Sanford trawlers near
Auckland recently—he was 3ft. long and weighed
231 b. l-Joz. The previous M.L. record was held by
one caught in the harbor of Manukau: that chap
weighed 221 b.
“Bourri” : What “Xamilc” (B. 3/12/’25)
saj s about the crow is in the main correct, but to
condemn strychnine altogether is too sweeping. My
experience through several lambings in Queensland
is that the poison alone is of little use, but mixed
vi oiaeie acid in the proportion of about three
to two it will lay them out every time, and in
most instances right at the bait. Over a good trial
I hardly ever saw it fail. Eaglehawks are a tougher
proposition. I watched one gorge itself one morning
on a big lamb thoroughly poisoned with this mix-
ture. It flew slowly to a near-by tree, settled a
moment, then fell to the ground, I thought it done
for, but put a bullet into the bird on the off-chance
of recovery, and left it lying propped on its wings.
I know the bullet hit it, for it turned a somersault
from the force of the impact. Returning about an
hour later I found it wandering about the plain,
apparently none the worse except for the bullet-wound.
I then finished the job, but had to run to keep
within range when the bird saw me coming.
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: The use of acorns as a
cure for dysentery (B. 3/12/’25) reminds me that
on the South Coast (N.S.W.) a quarter of a century
or so back, an old drover cured himself of the
same complaint, after the doctors had given him up,
by using the encrusted sap from the red-gum tree.
His method was to powder a lump about as big as
a pea and swallow it in a glass of milk.
GETTING ON.
VISITOR: “I think my riding has improved
considerably since I’ve been here.”
DAVE: “Why, you fell off again only’s morn-
in’.”
VISITOR: “ But I kept my bally monocle in,
y’know.”
“King-king” : How can you tell in which
direction a snake has gone by looking at its track?
I have spent the whole of my life in the bush and
am still unable to say whether the wriggler was
going or coming.
CHANGING VALUES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I blame the women with their barbarous ‘bobs’
for the recent increase in the charge for hair-
cutting from a shilling to eighteenpence. The
barbers are now independent of the men.” —Aggrieved
correspondent in Sydney Evening News.
Her hair was once a woman’s precious crown—-
Dear as to Malachi his golden collar—
But now, like other currency, it’s down
To half a dolour.
The barber, too, noting the changing scales,
Revision of his tariff has commenced.
He “bobs” the ladies now; the hapless males
Are eighteenpenced.

STOCKINGS
Christmas came and went wrapped in a
gossamer mantle of blue, gay with a glisten-
ing design in sunbeams and moonbeams, and
tied with ribands of little winds. It was a
beautiful Christmas and the best of it was
the rich crop of Christmas-trees and Santas
for kiddies of the busy or the striking poor.
Surely every youngster in and about the city
plucked a handful of toys and was made
happily uncomfortable with tlagons of ice
cream! And now the toys in the shop win-
dows have the dissipated look of the homing
reveller overtaken by dajlight in his dress
clothes.
On Saturday Randwick itself looked like
a jewelled cup of summer, with its green
sward and its brilliant flower-beds under a
tender blue dome. Perhaps it was the sky
that suggested blue as the suitable wear
to so many women—it appeared most trium-
phantly in Persian-like tones on the just-
returned-from-Europe Mrs. Henry Hill
Osborne. Another notable was Mrs. Jenner,
who was Dorothy Gordon. Straight from
Hollywood she comes, and wore green
georgettes and a large black hat to call on
Randwick ; with her was good-looking sister
Jeanette in palest yellow. Dorothea Mac-
kellar wore a blue-brimmed hat, and was
otherwise mixed blue and black. Another
mantled in blue was Mrs. John Martin.
Mrs. Pitt Rivers wore impressive millinery,
large, black and plumed; and one of the
most looked-at rigs was the pale-lilac georg-
ettes and squirrel-trimmed wrap of Leila
Reynolds, a youthful horse-owner from Eng-
land. With Leila came her mother, who gained
moral support from a bag that was large
and gold. Also to the party came Mrs. A.
E. Hughes in a frock of deep cream lace
and a hat feathered in golden browns:
golden also was her bag. Dutch blue pat-
terned Katherine Osborne’s white frock, and
tall Mona Rossiter supported black and
royal-blue swathings. Lace and pearls—
the pearls of the cultured classes—had a
great airing; and the basket and gay cre-
tonne shoe found favor with many.
Both the Wentworth and the Ambassa-
dors hung out the sign of the Christmas'-
bush and lured hundreds to attack a rich
food and a long jazz menu. The feature of
the Wentworth was the exhibition dancing
of John Juan and Zelda. Their turn is at
once spectacular and beautiful, and in the
groupings was like rhythmic sculpture. The
Ambassadors featured Peggy Willoughby
and the dancers Max and Babette.
How many little sick-a-beds there are in the
Kiddies Hospital can be gauged by the fact
that it took seven Santas to hand out the
toys to the small sufferers at the Christmas
party the other afternoon. The wards were
as gay as wards can be with Christmas bush
and bell, and little flags, and puff-faced bal-
loons, and up and down the aisles between
the cots walked a never-ending procession of
visitors—some had friends in the tiny beds,
but .many were just child-lovers in general.
Minister for Health Cann and his wife were
among the callers, and of course the hos-
pital’s chief, Dr. Clubbe, was there.
Sydney’s tliermometer-proof charity workers
turned, out splendidly at the theatrical
matinee held last week to put an extra
glitter on the Cliristmas-tree of the kiddies
who might otherwise be forgotten. The
programme was entirely made up of pros.,
each a star in either the J.C.W. or Tivoli
companies, and throughout an afternoon
more like a vapor bath than real weather
the good-natuivd men and women gave their
best turns to a crowded house. From their
afternoon turns came Ella Shields and other
Tivoli artists, and that meant in many
cases a snatched cup of tea so that they’d
be in time for the evening performance.
Emma Temple, Maud Fane, Marie Burke
and Muriel Starr were just a few on the
long programme. May Sheehan, of St.
Margaret’s, and Mrs. Gore-Jones, of the
Kindergarten Union, shepherded the peddlers
of the trifles that are the by-products at
gala afternoons. Mrs. Pitt Rivers traded in
programmes. E. J. Tait himself was the
organiser of the money-raiser, which helped
St. Margaret’s Hospital, the Kindergarten
Union and St. Vincent’s Orphanage.
The big excitement out at Moore Park
Palais for weeks past has been the Beauty
Competition among the hundreds of pretty
girls who dance there regularly. The com-
petition has been decided in heats, and for
the final judgment only about 12 remained.
The public, a group of representatives
and artist George Lambert had the last
vote and finally Peggy Mouat, a blonde
of the first water, blue-eyed, shingled and
slim, plucked the bauble. This is a cheque
for £lOO and a trip to Melbourne to measure
her charms against the dancing belle of Mel-
bourne Town, and whichever of the two is
declared the Venus of the two States gets
another £lOO. Three other of the 12 pretty
creatures, Dot Hawtrey, Kathleen Court and
Honor O’Brien, who tied for second place,
will each get £2O. A strong argument in
Peggy’s favor was her deportment—it was a
treat to see her walk across the floor.
On Monday the luxury-ship Carinthia,
which •is showing a few hundred American
millionaires the world, tied up in Sydney
Cove, presently slipped into a fascinating
tea-gowm of bunting and fripperies, and was
at home to a number of Sydney callers
while her voyagers were ashore. Captain E.
G. Diggle and tiie Cunard Co. were the hosts.
The visitors, mostly spectacled and chiefly
female, saw Sydney from a procession of
motor-cars in the morning and went round
the harbor in the afternoon. Then, having
thus done Noo South Wales thoroughly,
they got aboard for their departure, which
was fixed for Tuesday at noon.
Mrs - B- R- S. Mackinnon, back from
Geneva, where they once made watches but
now make good resolutions, is still collecting
the posy and the brew of welcome. The
civic fastness spread the red carpet for her;
the Clerical Women’s Association, the Fem-
inist Club, the National Councillors and the
Women’s League of N. S. Wales, not to
speak of the Red Cross Army, have all turned
a flattering ear while the lady with the agile
tongue has recounted her experiences in
Switzerland. But always her cry has been
“Australia needs more people,” and her ad-
vice is to start with boy and girl migrants.
A note from a Perth girl in Sydney:—
Apprehensive heads were shaken among the crowd
that watched the plucky Mrs. Marion Bell leave
Perth on October 14 on her round-Australia trip,
and for several days the lady had been subjected
to vain but well-meant persuasions and entreaties not
to attempt anything so hazardous. The people who
assembled outside Sydney G.P.O. on December 23 to
give her the glad hand on having accomplished so
much of her journey were full of enthusiastic admira-
tion ; there was no room or need for any other feel-
ing. I was in both crowds, and it seemed to me
that the lady had been metamorphosed in her trans-
lation from west to east. She began her jour-
ney looking very masculine in riding-breeches and
leggings, a khaki coat and a professional-looking
motor-cap. She whirled into my ken again last
week an essentially feminine being, skirted, short-
sleeved, wearing a piquant little hat first-cousin to
a Tam o’ Shanter. And she wasn’t markedly sun-
burnt, either. The car, a new one, showed little
traces of the long itinerary except that the paint
was a bit scratched. And it still carried the Excel-
sior device I had noted two months before: “Aropid
Australia—Smiling Through”— a true word indeed.
This smiling lady is Gilda Pattini, one of
the youngest prima donnas in the world.
She is a prin-
cipal soprano
of the Rigo
Opera Com-
pany, and was
the Rosina in
its opening
performance of
‘‘The Barber.”
The veteran
producer,
Frank Rigo,
declares that
she has “a
voice of gold,”
and predicts
for her a daz-
zling future.
She is a Syd-
ney girl and
owes her train-
ing to Mrs.
Hugh Ward
and Signor Di
Giorgio, and to
Mr. Fossati, who is conducting for the com-
pany. She will be remembered as the Bea-
trice Hope of J. C. Williamson productions.
Howard Harris made the picture.
A fellow-voyager on the Narkunda from
England with Pat Sullivan was Charles
Rolfe, who left Australia 13 years ago
to find a larger market for his voice; the
coincidence of that travelling companionship
was that, whilst they were still in their
years of struggle, fne pair were room-mates
in New York, and their meeting on the
Narkunda was quite an accident. The
creator of Felix the Cat has gone on to
America again, but Rolfe is staying with his
relations in Cooma, where lie was born, and
will be two months in Australia before en-
gagements in England call him back.
The most feted man in Sydney during the
Past fortnight was Brig.-General Brand, who
early in the New Year will take up an im-
portant job at Army Headquarters in Mel-
bourne. The last words—-‘‘a soldier and a
man"—of the Limbless Soldiers’ address of
appreciation sums up the reason for liis popu-
iarity amongst all classes. The Lord Mayor
will accord the Diggers’ favorite General a
reception before he leaves for Melbourne pn
January 7.
The Garrison sergeants in Victoria Bar-
racks handed Mrs. 0. H. Brand a case of
table-silver and cutlery large enough to be
booked as excess baggage when she and her
General go to Melbourne early in 1926. The
affair took the form of a Sunday-evening
gathering in the Warrant-Officers’ Mess
music-room. Big and smiling H. H. C. Bus-
sell, president of the mess, and a hefty com-
mittee had organised the stout token of re-
gard to the slim lady, who has been so
popular that all hands were linked to the
rousing strains of “Auld Lang Syne.”
This much-telescoped young man (if he
were unwound to his full height he’d be as
tall as a lamp-
post and sap-
ling - slender)
is John Trevor,
who has been
helping Don
Finley produce
the Miracle
Play at Burde-
kin House.
When Ken.
Webb, the
amateurs’ hope
as stage-
manager, sud-
denly fell ill,
John Trevor
filled the
breach, and
helped in
every way
from building
the stage to
interviewing
the curious,
who kept dashing in from the tea-room
across the hall to know what the hammer-
ing in the ballroom meant. John is known
in Hobart and Launceston as a member of
the Brandon Cremer stock company, he
played small parts with the Muriel Starr
“Garden of Allah” company, and he flits
about under various disguises in “Hello,
Marmaduke,” an Australian film. He was
Father Anthony in the Repertory produc-
tions of “Getting Married” and “The Sec-
ond Round.” While at Sydney Grammar he
helped W. F. Jackson in the production of
some of the school’s plays. Picture from
May Moore.
A wedding of interest to the North Side
mainly concerned Mrs. Elsie Freda Coventry,
of Mosman, and Dr. Ross Smith, of Cre-
morne. Padre A. H. Austin tied the knot
in the quiet depths of the Pitt-street Congre-
gational Church. Platinum georgette and
lace were assembled in the bride’s frock, and
an outsize hat of the reddish-brown that is
called rosewood drooped amiably about her
face. Mrs. Mark Lewis carried the bride’s
pink and yellow roses as well as her own
pink blossomry while the ring was being
bandied about, and enhanced the tailorings
of best-man Dr. John Paling with her own
stone-grey georgettes and millinery. Bride’s
mother, Mrs. Board, exchanged wedding-
cake for congratulations at the Australia,
and later on the two principals left for
Melbourne to pick up the outward-bound
Narkunda.
A young man from Melbourne has annexed
one of Point Piper’s prettiest blondes. lie
is “Breezy” Gale, and the prize is Molly
Rutherford, a daughter of the medical Ruth-
erfords. “Breezy” is quite a fellow at the
oars, and is remembered as the kid from
Melbourne Grammar who went into camp
and got a commission when he was 17 or so.
Shortly afterwards the headmaster of Gram-
mar, Loftus Franklin, came into camp as
a private, and only for “Breezy’s” horrified
refusal and his own quick plucking of a
commission might have been told off as his
former pupil’s batman. The young man’s
father has been one of the officials at Federal
Parliament House since Federation; a
brother won fame as a champion runner.
Staying at the Women’s Club and renew-
ing old friendships is Alice Henry, who will
be remembered as a Melbourne journalist
some 20 years ago. In 1005 she went to
England and Belgium as a representative of
the Charity Organisation Society of Mel-
bourne ; crossing to the United States, where
she lectured on Australian subjects, she
took root, and soon was deep in women’s
movements in Chicago.
The Ivretschmann Chib boiled an outsize
billy in honor of the Cyril Monk couple the
other day. The,violinist and his composer-
lady are off to Europe with the New Year,
and the brew - was a sort of loving-cup of
farewell. Cyril was one of the beloved
Kretsehmann’s early pupils, and it was his
teacher’s enthusiastic interest in him that
made the way easy for the Sydney man to
go abroad for further study. The party was
at the feminist stronghold, and Ruby "Rich,
herself a pupil of Mr. Kretschmann and now
president of the club that perpetuates his
memory, handed Cyril a pocket-wallet and
Mrs. Monk a pink-and-blue posy with ap-
propriate wishes from the members. After
the speeches, tea and music were the enter-
tainments of the afternoon.
The Tropics, with their mystery and
romance, swept dizzyingly before your mental
gaze as you turned the knob at the Queens-
land Bureau one afternoon last week. Scent
of the pineapple, the mango, the banana and
the pawpaw pierced the nostrils with incense
ot the sun-drenched out-of-doors. Once inside
the room glowing mounds of beauty met the
eye. Pineapples and grapefruit of a complexion
never seen in city shop-windows; satin-smooth
pawpaws of emerald green and pale saffron;
mangoes ruddy as a frost-stung cheek; things
with names delicious to the tongue like
granadilla, tamarind, rosella —they were there
in profusion from the plantations of rich
sister of the North. Cocoanuts, dates, alliga-
tor pears, the breadfruit of shipwreck
romance and that freak-fruit the mango-
steen smiled among the lxeaped-up earth-
magic in such perfection of form and such
coloring as to ravish the eye of the artist
and set poets swimming in a curling wave of
fancy on to the sands of some enchanted
shore.
The Feminists wore their best array and
rallied scores strong to the glory of Nona
Newman, who for five years has been a sort
of honorary recording angel to the club. The
party was a “nutty” one—you did everything
possible with shell-fruit except tell a chestnut.
Ruby Rich handed over a brass bowl, clothing
the act in rounded periods; and Mrs.
Osbourne England supported the advance
with a mass of delphiniums and yellow roses.
Died in a London nursing-home, from the
after-effects of appendicitis, Mrs. W. Sewell,
who was well known in Perth and Mel-
bourne. The lady was on a tour of Europe
with her husband and family when the end
came.
Ex-Judge Hamilton and daughter Marie
have been visiting the Trossachs and linking
up with Scotch and English relations. The
Judge, who is a rabid collector, is in much
better health and is having a great time
among the second-hand shops and antique
stores. He does the round of them in any
district where he spends as much as a day—
they say he contemplates a monumental work
on the Pawnshops of Old England.
Brisbane has Christmas, too:
At the Children’s Hospital, Nurse Noakes played
Santa Claus and went through the decorated wards
distributing gifts to the patients who couldn’t come
to the Courier tree. The entrance to McConnel
Ward, where the tree was set up, was filled with
peach blossom and lanterns. In the Raff Ward yellow
and mauve predominated, and there was a blue pond
with white ducks. The Cowlishaw Ward was mastic
and blue with blue and gold butterflies hovering over
the cots. In the Chelmsford Ward, where the babies
are, pale pink canopies with blue ribbons and dolls
and animal figures brought Christmas to the wee
sufferers. In the Isolation Block there were special
trees —bronze, orange and flame was the color scheme
here. Sister Payne’s quarters were lit up with pale
pink and blue hydrangeas, and here visitors were
entertained at tea.
The Jocks had their Christmas party for the
Highland Society’s juvenile dancers in St. Luke’s Hall,
where a Christmas-tree was laden with wonderful
fruit, and the pipes skirled Santa Claus McLeod
into the hall. There was a musical programme, too,
here.
Mrs. J. T. Bell, Mrs. Arthur Clark and Joshua and
Margot Bell leave for the Cold Country this week.
A farewell party was given to Mrs. Bell and Mrs. T.
H. Brown, who leaves a little later. The Cecil
Palmers decked Palma Rosa for the parting cup.
Victor Cotton, of the Hidden Vale Cottons, had
business of consequence with Vivienne Scott, of the
Hornet Bank Scotts, on Dec. 22. Rev. George Neal
assisted the parties, and Ernest Lord, of Eslcdale,
gave the bride away in cream and gold brocade
with a cream ’broidered veil and a bouquet of roses.
Marion Clapperton, in cream lace, and Dorothy Haw-
thorn, in blue, ’maided. Pink and blue hydrangeas
dressed up the station homestead for the reception.
There was a good attendance in the Exhibition
concert-hall when the Musical Union gave “The
Messiah.’’ Lena Hammond wore Oriental brocade and
received many flowers; Nancy Muirhead, in orchid
mauve, sopranoed; and Ted England excelled in “Why
Do the Nations?’’ George Sampson kept everything
together in his best form.
Three hundred kiddies were entertained at the
Seamen’s Catholic Club with a gorgeous Christmas
tree and gift presentations. There was also a concert
and a display of juggling. Mrs. Tom Ryan had a
busy hand in the work of the committee.
Mrs. Knox arranged a Christmas-tree at the Lady
Musgrave Sanitarium at Sandgate for 30 convalescent
little ones and a number of kiddies who came by
ambulance from the city. In a car, surrounded by
gay balloons, Father Christmas arrived; the tree
was on the lawn overlooking Moreton Bay. Tea was
spread on the verandahs; the tables were bright with
bird and butterfly. Matron Flewell-Smith and others
decorated the wards in crimson and gold.
J. F. McCaffrey, appointed to succeed Cumbrae
Stewart as Registrar of Queensland Uni., has been
chief clerk and accountant since the beginnings,
15 years ago, and has earned his promotion. He
will still be “Mac” so far as the students are
concerned, and the same old friendly grin will meet
the quips and sallies shot in his direction .on Com-
mem. Day.

A bright sun and a cool wind that took
one on to early autumn made life very pleas-
ant amid the trees of Caulfield on Boxing
Day. Though folks didn’t make a dress-
parade of this V.A.T.C. meeting, there were
some quite cheerful toilettes, matched pre-
sently by faces as cheerful—-these worn by
those punters who arrived early at the de-
duction that seven was to be the after-
noon’s lucky number. Number seven was
home first four times out of six, and was
placed in another. Vice-royalty was absent,
but several well-known sports enjoyed the
last race-day of the year. Dame Clara Butt
was the most striking personage in the com-
mittee’s ladies’ box; she was in a henna-hued
knitted suit with a red fox choker topped by
a black hat. With her was Mrs. Leroy
Burnham in black crepe romaiue with a
Bangkok hat banded with velvet. A straw-
berry-lined hat and gown with a dash of gold
were worn by Mrs. Ben Cliaffey. Phyllis
Mein, who was with her mother, Mrs. Poul-
teney Mein, was a siren flapper in a powder-
blue striped silk frock and a shady headpiece.
Mrs. G. E. Flannery, of Sydney, wore black
ottoman silk, a posy of pink roses resting
on her black hat. Her sister, Mrs. Brennan,
of Cootamundra, Jiad a small hat of biscuit-
toned georgette above a black toilette. A
new departure in feminine covering was a
two-piece frock of bois-de-rose shade, which
showed beneath the tunic a skirt very full
and gathered into a band at the foot.
The entrance and foyer of His Majesty’s
were as eerie as the Magic Cave itself when
Aladdin sought his lamp. Within nothing
that might be expected by pantomime con-
noisseurs has been left out—except tights.
Legs well powdered but otherwise naked and
unashamed, crowned by the most abbreviated
of gorgeously embroidered trunks, are a fea-
ture of the show, which in this as in other
respects follows the modern practice in the
other hemisphere. Memories of “Kismet,”
“Chu Chin Chow” and the 743 previous
“Aladdins” linger in the ornate Chinese set-
tings and still more decorative robes and
costumes. June Elvidge, a very nice looking
Princess, wears a fascinating garment of the
prettiest of mauve, blue and petunia-hued
georgette and brocade coats, over lengthy
trousers of satin richly embroidered. Her
wedding gown, a glimmer of pale pink under-
neath crystal and pearl-traced lace, is
attached to a few miles of more filmy lace,
star-spangled, which covers the staircase and
forms a sort of back curtain to the stage itself.
Bruce Green as the Dame does not confine
himself to the usual rococo garments, but
makes a bid for feminine appreciation in
at least two most pleasing day-frocks and
hats and a dinner-dress of apricot tone with
feather trimming, topped by ear-rings and
a tiara. Jennie Benson, a sturdy Aladdin,
raises much admiration in her occidcntalised
Oriental attire. A black suit with gold
dragons appliqued thereon takes first place,
perhaps, against one of gold tissue and lace
spotted with jewels. The chorus leans
strongly to raiment of the coolie-de-luxe
type, in figured silks and tasselled hats,
though Pierrot attire of colored lace with
bat-like wings is assumed at one stage.
“Jack and the Beanstalk’s” premiere at
the Princess on Boxing Day was an
affair of full houses, speeches, flowers and
gifts innumerable. Elsie Prince, nicest ot
principal boys, wears a bewildering array of
suits, including one in yellow and blue vel-
vet, and another in silver and rose brocade
with flowing cape and dangling sword. To
slay the giant she attires herself in a coat
of mail and white ostrich plumes, giving a
Joan of Arc effect. Nellie Barnes, principal
girl for the first time in her panto, career, is
blue eyed, very dainty and very young.
Whether in yellow taffeta with muslin fichu and
flower-trimmed droop millinery, or in festive
bridal array, she looks the most charming
doll imaginable. Joe Brennan, the Dame,
sports a neatly-shingled coiffure along with
a qnite-up-to-the-moment evening frock of
jade green and orange georgette, a froth of
handkerchief flounces. The Fairy Queen pre-
sents something new in white silk wigs with
two plaits and a frock, all billows of tulle
and silver lace.
“The Music-box Revue,” at the Palace,
gives Madge White the opportunity to in-
dulge in some effective frocking. (Specially
notable is an all-amethyst dress weighted
with velvet flowers of the same shade, and
crinoline hat of the exact color. There is
the merit of novelty in a gown of tones
shaded from yellow to flame, which has a
bordering of feathers of a like coloring.
Winifred Dalle’s gleaming white raiment in
the waltz-song scene has an edging of peacock-
green velvet. Italian, Dutch, Irish and other
national styles of dressing figure in the set-
ting of a vocal effort by Leslie Pearce, and
blue and white is the color scheme of the
dressing in the orange group scene, with its
rich lighting effects.
Dame Clara Butt, in the Philharmonic’s
hundredth performance of “The Messiah,” at
the Exhibition, appeared in her white satin
wedding-gown, remodelled by “Lucille” (Lady
Duff Gordon), with additions of dewdrop-
sprinkled tulle and a deep fringe. Draperies
trailed from a scintillating shoulder orna-
ment, and got lost in yards of train. Etcet-
eras were a diamond tiara and such baubles
as ropes of pearls and diamonds. Dorothy
Humphreys, widow’ of one of the victims of
the concrete-building collapse a few months
ago, sang the soprano solos attired in a black
beaded robe with a touch of mauve. As an
interlude, Robert Best conferred a laurel
wreath upon conductor Alberto Zelman to
mark the fact that this was the thirtieth
time he had guided the Phil, forces in the
Handel masterpiece.
Father Christmas had such a busy time
this year that he had to call up no end of
understudies. It seems not to matter very
much who plays the part of the genial gentle-
man provided he wears the correct costume
and comes heavily laden. Patients at the
Eye and Ear had an annual treat when the
choristers of the Collins-street Congrega-
tional Church sang carols, and the crimson
of Santa made a cheering note in the wards,
as mysterious parcels, smokes and sweets
were handed out —it was the 14th celebra-
tion of the kind. A tree and all the accom-
panying party was provided from a special
Christmas Cheer fund; the city and country
auxiliaries of the hospital lent their aid in
providing donations.
Nowhere was Santa with his attendant
clown hailed more joyously than by the
children at the Institute for the Blind, where
his arrival was a feature of the Christmas
party, prize-giving and sports. There was
also a tree, all its strong points enumerated
to the sightless guests by their more for-
tunate little friends. Thanks to people who
are interesting themselves in the institute,
nearly £lOO was available to buy presents for
the rejoicings. The mayor and mayoress
were there and gave prizes for studies and
games. President J. L. Carnegie claims that
the Victorian Institute holds a world’s re-
cord in the matter of bonuses paid to its
blind workers. Manufactured goods valued
at £28,000 are annually manufactured, and
the workers draw all the profits and a bit
more.
Melbourne Hospital patients were given
a musical Christmas party by violinist
Alberto Zelman and others, the out-patients’
department, pink lights twinkling amid
streamers and balloons, being transmogrified
for the occasion. Mrs. Zelman’s mezzo-
soprano notes were amongst those heard
during the evening, and after the entertain-
ment there was a one-step in which nurses
and their friends and the medical staff
joined.
The lass of the waved shingle rooking
from out this Lafayette picture is Ceridwen
Kelly, who
has just added
to her local
fame as an
amateur act-
ress by her
fascin atin g
presentation of
t h e elusive
colleen in “Ail-
of - a - Sudden
Peggy” at the
Palace Theatre
- the show
was for tli e
Nows b o y s’
Society an d
tli e Theatre
Association.
Ceridwen is a
valued member
of the Reper-
tory Society,
and was in the
cast of t. h e
recent performance of John Drinkwater’s
“Abraham Lincoln.”
A feature of Christmas Eve in Melbourne,
recalling the. license permitted in medieval
Europe at the Courts of Misrule, was the
appearance of corps of hoy and girl singers
in the streets, the girls arrayed as boys and
the boys as girls. Curious crowds surveyed
these breakers of the law and flung them
coppers, while the bobbies passed them by.
Once a year members of the Licensed
Bookmakers’ Association lay aside their
customary acumen and pay out on all the
starters, so to speak, for there are no also-
rans when they visit the Children’s Hospital
at Carlton on Christmas Eve. Their
thirteenth visit to the institution left, each
small sufferer a substantial dividend in toys
and festive fare,
There is so much musical talent going to
waste among the nurses of the Alfred Hos-
pital that the institution has no trouble at
all in doing its own carol-singing. Guided
by the baton of Dr. Mackeddie, the singers
on Christmas Eve proceeded through each
flower-decked ward lifting up melodious
voices, with occasional aid from the many
visitors. The adornment of the hospital was
carried out after the Japanese manner, the
nursing staff being responsible for the
arrangement of peach and cherry blooms, lan-
terns, balloons and butterflies that hovered
above lampshades glowing in gorgeous hues.
A Christmas-tree was, of course, the centre
of joy in the children’s section.
The newly elected are not going to waste
any time, for the blue tickets of admission
(including tea) to the opening of the Tenth
Parliament of the Commonwealth are out.
Fates have been defied; the date is Jan. 13.
The Melbourne branch of the English-
Speaking Union, which now numbers close-
up a thousand
members, is
not merely a
social society
devoted to tea-
parties an d
luncheons ; its
aims are also
educat ioual
and inspiring.
Secretary R.
Gip p s has
great support
in his wife,
w li o has
formed the
Common In-
terests branch
and is ever
spreading the
gospel of the
E.S.U. The
lady, pictured
by Spencer
Slii e r, was
before her
marriage early in tins expiring year Alys
Kirkland, well known in Bananaland’s
capital as a clever elocutionist. Just prior
to settling in Melbourne she spent a couple
of years in England and on the Continent,
storing her mind.
The Welcome committee of the E.S.U.
made Mrs. Emmerton’s return an excuse for
an _ agreeable clatter of tea-cups at the
Union’s rooms: and that the temperature
was around 95deg. affected the patronage
not at all. The same cakes served to give
greeting to several oversea visitors. There
were Dr. MacEachern from Canada, who
is casting his professional eye over our hos-
pitals ; Mrs. MacEachern, robed in black ; Dr.
Delprat from San Francisco, one of the ex-
Broken Hill manager’s clever brood, with his
wife, whose frock was of delphinium-blue
crepe de Chine; Richard Linton of the Little
Brother movement; Mrs. Linton, whose
black gown had embroidery in gold, allied
to a black satin hat; and fair and fascinat-
ing Renee Kelly, who furnishes a past for
Polly and a future for Polly’s managers—she
was summery in floral ninon overshadowed
by a hat in which yellow and white lilies
bloomed.
There was interchange of greetings at
the Austral Salon when president Mrs.
Thomas Baker, a symphony in beige, and her
sister. Miss Eleanor Shaw, with blue hat
above if "frock of’ ivbt’y cf&pe do. Chine, Were
joint entertainers. Instrumental and vocal
fare was provided for the guests, Waiter
Kirby being the chiefest and plumpest song-
bird. Mrs. Maurice Dudley and Alba Za-
cutti introduced also a bright sketch. Black
moire envelope-bags were handed the Salon's
secretary, Alice Richardson, and its lion,
treasurer, Mrs. Galway, as mementoes of
their faithful stewardship.
The only student this year at the Uni.
Con. to secure the coveted distinction of
Bachelor of Music is pianist Mona Nugent,
of Nathalia, up Murray way. The lass,
who also has some vocal talent, walked oil'
with first-class honors.
Not by the widest stretch of imagination
could Archbishop 'Mannix be described as
corpulent. On the contrary the ascetic
divine is painfully thin about the shanks
and small of girth. Nevertheless as the mili-
tant cleric stepped off the train at Spencer-
street the other day, following his arrival
from the Ould Country, one of his enthusias-
tic admirers shouted fervently: “Bedad! He's
a heart in his shtomaeh as big as a wheel-
barrow."
A scorching sirocco, accompanied by
clouds of dust, handicapped the White Ele-
phant auction organised by Mrs. Jim Angus
for the. Alfred Hospital. The most inveterate
of bargain-hunters must have been deterred
by such an atmosphere, but the cause is a
good one and bidders were generous, nearly
£2OO being gathered in. Elsie Prince, prin-
cipal boy in the “Jack and the Beanstalk”
panto, at the Princess, attended to set the
ball rolling, her sacrificial elephant being a
portable gramophone. Arthur 11. Donecker
waved the hammer over an array of offerings
that ranged from discarded Paris models to
a piano, and included more than one case of
still wine and a bottle of fizz.
Australia's sculptor-knight Bertram Mac-
kennal, who chisels for the Royal family and
other exalted mortals, has been so long away
from home that his return in February is
looked forward to as quite an event. He
brings with him his English wife, who was
Agnes Spooner, a fellow art-student in Paris
in less triumphant days. She showed promise
as a painter, but since her marriage she
has forsaken brush and palette. They have
one child, a daughter, who will not accom-
pany her parents. Mr. and Mrs. H. J.
Mackennal, with their two sons, are the
only members of the family in Melbourne.
Another brother, Eric, is in America.
Dulcie Bland, a promising amateur mum-
mer, made a big hit in the 1 part of the bride
at a recent wedding, in which Allen Ingram
Meakin, of Geelong, also played a leading
role. The young lady wore a veil of old
Honiton falling over a gown of white satin
traced with silver embroidery and dangling
crystal fringe. Her quartette of attendant
maids, also displaying raiment of white and
diver, were headed by her sister Marjorie.
Subsequently at Wickliffe House the bride’s
mother was hostess in a black georgette gown
embroidered in gold.
London papers announce the engagement
of Eileen Sharp, now playing at the New
Theatre, to Clive Shields, son of Sir Douglas,
the Australian surgeon, who is said to have
the best-equipped private hospital in London.
Clive is the grandson of I)r. Shields, for so
long medical officer to Melbourne Gaol. He
was named Clive after Baronet William
Clarke’s third son—the two families were
intimate friends for years. Harold Fink,
son of 8.J., left a fortune which helped to
equip the Shields hospital.
Aylmer Buesst, now the senior conductor
of the British National Opera Company, has
just announced his engagement to May
Blytli, a leading soprano in the company.
Buesst is a native of Victoria, where both
his mother and grandmother were notables
in music circles. He learned to wield the
baton at the Lcipsig Conservatoire when the
famous Nikisch was in charge; when the
war broke out he was conducting opera at
Breslau. After getting back into mufti he
was associated for a time with the Beecham
Opera enterprises.
Tenor Walter Kirby had a distinction
conferred upon him on Boxing Day. He
was made the object of a topical allusion by
the comedians of two pantomimes.
Sister Adelaide’s P.S.: —
Christmas has brought a library to the Children’s
Hospital, the gift of that good citizen A. J.
Roberts. The formal presentation was made at the
hospital, with the Board to take delivery and T>r.
Helen Mayo to vouch for the value of such a gift,
especially in long-continued illnesses —they sometimes
keep the children in hospital for years. Cash dona-
tions from other subscribers were handed over as
the nucleus of a permanent library fund. The Red
Cross gifts to soldiers still in hospital were dis-
tributed by Lady Bridges, with tea in the recreation
room at the Keswick Hospital.
From N’Yorlc comes news that Merle Robertson
has appeared there —at the Carnegie Hall —with Percy
Grainger, and scored a success. She is a pianist
with technique and power more like a man’s than
a woman’s, and it was visiting artists who urged her
to try her luck in the States.
The whole of the over-subscribed Alexandra memorial
funds are to go to their, original objectives—three
cots for the Children’s Hospital instead of two,
with a surplus £lOO to spend on linen, and £2OO
for furnishing the proposed new wing at the Queen's
Home.
The mayoral Bruces’ daughter has been Christmas-
ing too, and sponsored a tree for the children of
St. Mary’s Mission of Hope. The small guests were
motored over to the Scales’s garden at Medindie,
where there was tea, and a tree that rioted in
balloons and stockings and toys. A dozen or so of
the younger set helped the hostess.
Yellow cabs, now as thick as wasps round a
jampot, had their activity temporarily suspended a
couple of days after they began operations by cut
telephone wires that isolated all the suburban stands
and a couple of the city boxes. But the plotters
were poor ones and did the damage in the small hours
o’ Sunday morning, when the demand for taxis in
this well-conducted village is at a minimum.
H. S. Power, thawing himself while he paints In
England, has just finished a portrait of Admiral Patey'
• —so pleasing to his subject that another has been
commissioned. At the moment the South Australian
is busy on his Academy pictures—one of them a
hunting group.
Chief Justice Murray and his sister are back from
a 10 months’ trip that took them to France and
the Netherlands, Switzerland and Italy, as well as
Britain. They bring news that Lord Kintore plans a
visit to Australia while his daughter is at Federal
Government House. The Chief Justice found Wembley
“very fine’’ and the tattoo there “the most inspiring
sight I ever saw in my life.”
Edna Thomas, all crinolined white muslin for her
first act and bustled green tartan for her second,
dropped in for a couple of days on her way to the
Narkunda and gave two good-bye concerts at the
Town Hall. But the exodus to hills and seaside
had robbed the city of many of her friends, and
the attendances w'ere poor. She found time to dash
up to Ambleside for a final word with the Heysens.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Once more the form revealed by the
A.J.C. Holiday Handicap has proved a good guide to
the result of the Summer Cup. Oddly enough,
thousands of punters persuaded themselves tnat
Dainty Davie’s ridiculously easy win in the Holiday
Handicap was a fluke and that Master
aged horse who has had a solitary success at 12
furlongs but has never even been placed at 13 —
would turn the tables in the Cup. The seven-year-
old battler was favorite at s’s, whereas Dainty Davie
was at 6’s, Luddenham and the frail-looking Freddie
O at 7’s, The Wild Goose at B's, Bard of Avon and
Royal Roue at 10’s, Solidify and Moisha at 12’s,
the stable-mates Player and Highlander at 16’s to 2'o’s
and Prince Minimbah at 25’s. Moisha was indulged
with the lead for about a mile, whereupon Waterman,
the Newcastle jockey, took Dainty Davie to the
front. The solid bay had the race in his keeping
two furlongs from home, and at the finish there
were five lengths between him and the second horse,
Player, who was followed by the fading Prince
Minimbah (last year’s winner), Highlander and
Luddenham. Player, Highlander and Luddenham con-
stituted the last batch for about nine furlongs, and
all three ran home well, Highlander particularly,
but in no circumstances could any of them have
beaten Dainty Davie, whose time —2min. 44isee. —
was isec. outside the race record. The 10s. tote
returned good dividends, allowing for the 13i p.c.
deduction, fractions of sixpences included —Dainty
Davie’s was £3 3s. 6d., Player’s £2 9s. and
Prince Minimbah’s £1 17s. On a straightout
machine with a 131 p.c. deduction, Dainty Davie
would have paid about 91 to 1. Which means, of
course, that those who backed him at 6 to 1 —
and many took 5’s —did not get fair odds.
Apart from wagers, Dainty Davie earned £1975
for the owner who races under the name of F.
Langford, arid if J. Barden, the trainer, received the
customary percentage his share was £197 10s. An-
other of Barden’s string, the grey Chrysolaus—Lady
Rylstone filly, Lady Constance, won the £2OOO
December Stakes for S. W. Phillips. Her recent
exhibitions had not been encouraging, and a 10lb.
penalty (the consequence of an October success) was
imposed on her original Bst. slb. ; nevertheless, with
Pike’s able assistance, she proved much too good for
Troisieme, Bunkum and 10 others, Perfect Night, a
7-to-4 favorite, shaping poorly. Lady Constance went
out at 14 to 1 and paid nearly that (£7 25.) on
the 10s. tote, which declared two other dividends.
She was one of three long-priced winners (the others
were Aeneid, 12’s, and White and Black, 10’s) who
enabled McShortodds to go home well ahead of it.
Eaton Boy (s’s,), who had run second to Dainty
Davie in the Holiday Handicap, won the A.J.C.
Handicap, 10 furlongs, after a capital race with
Barosca and Meenah, but the last-named, who was
favorite at 9 to 2, got tangled up in the barrier
and lost several lengths. She could hardly have
been beaten otherwise.
The Flying Handicap was regarded as a dress
rehearsal for the Carrington Stakes. Beauford’s
four-year-old half-brother Anambah —a big black geld-
ing who looks every inch a galloper—-was favorite at
7 to 2, but Pat Osborne put in heavily on Valicare
(s’s), the three-year-old sister to Lausanne, and there
was also a substantial commission for Lilah, who
firmed from B’s to 4’s, receding a point or two at
the finish. Cajole (7’s), Cadenza (10’s) and Red
Gauntlet (12’s) were also backed. Lilah jumped
out smartly, but Valicare was soon disputing the
lead with her, and the filly had a slight advantage
as they turned into the straight. Over the last
furlong there was only one in it, Valicare clearing
right away from Lilah and going on to win by three
lengths in lmin. llifsee. Lilah was beaten three
lengths for second place by Anambah, who came
late on the scene and finished well; of the others,
Braehead and V'aliard ran respectably, but Cajole
showed no dash at all. In running past Lalah
Yalieare interfered with Poison’s mare, and Sullivan,
the jockey, was suspended for three mouths, a
sentence which will prevent him from riding a
warm favorite for the Carrington Stases, in that
race Anambah (7st. 8lb.) will meet the filly on 31b.
better terms (Valicare has 7st. 41b.), but alb.
seems unlikely to bring them together over six
furlongs, although there might be another tale to
tell if the distance were seven furlongs or a mile.
Perhaps Leslie Wallace (Bst. 71b.) will beat them
both. He was a first-class two-year-old (he is foui
now) and has been doing splendidly on the track
—at Randwick on Saturday morning he galloped six
in lmin. 14sec.
Dainty Davie will also have a new pilot in his
next rate, the Tattersall’s Club Cup, Waterman hav-
ing been suspended for two months on the ground
of interference with Moisha. The change of jockeys
may hurt the son of Don Reynaldo more than the
101 b. penalty which increases his weight to 7st.
lllb., for he is a difficult horse to ride, especially
if there is something alongside him in the straight.
Possibly Highlander (7st. 51b.) or Meenah (Bst.)
will account for him on Friday, but he has an
undeniable chance. For the minor events of the
Tattersall’s Club meeting Sea Risk, Lintress and
Johnnie Jones may be worth considering, and
Pigeon Pie is not to be lightly discarded, although
he has failed twice.
* * * *
Most of those who went to Caulfield for
the V.A.T.C. Boxing Day meeting would have felt
happier at the cricket match. Punters had a very
bad time; not one favorite was successful. For
the Hopetoun Cup, 11 ffirlongs, Suomi was always
a 6 to 4 favorite, with All Sunshine at 6’s, The
Tyrant, Warwickshire and Spearer at B’s and Spear-
age at 10's, from 14’s to 25’s being offered about
the others. The favorite had a good position early,
but did not gallop kindly and was last into the
straight. He made up a lot of ground from then
on, but Warwickshire and Spearage were too far in
front, and in a great struggle the former got the
verdict by half a head from Spearage, with the
favorite a long neck away third and The Tyrant fourth.
Warwickshire did not win out of his turn, for he
had repeatedly run into minor places; he was third
to Suomi at the Valley. By Kenilworth—Lady Eagle,
he is trained and owned by E. J. O’Dwyer, and was
ridden by “Tich” Wilson, who had two winning
mounts during the day. The time, 2min. 19fsee.,
equalled the course record, and the winner was the
fourth No. 7to score. The Malvern Handicap, seven
furlongs, provided another close finish, as Cadorus
(6’s) just landed the money by half a head from
Metellus (7 to 2), with Patro (12’s) half a length
away. The imported mare Amanteel, favorite at 2’s,
ran a poor race. Sid Ferguson—a trainer who
knows how to place his horses—has charge of the
winner and A. Coppel owns him. A fine-looking colt
in Shanghai (S) to 2) was successful in the Juvenile
Stakes, five furlongs, for which Parlita was a 2-to-l

favorite; Royal Romance, a sister to Royal Charter,
and Margaux were in the places. Shanghai is by
Bernard —Rose of Blen, and is therefore a brother to
Sunburst, who recently died in Sydney. He is
trained by Dave Price, who was successful with
Flamberge in the Hurdle Race, and is likely to be
heard of again, as also is Royal Romance. Beau
Fils (15’s), a goodi-looking imported horse in
Jack Holt’s stable, took the Koornang Welter from
Idle Time (3 to 1) and Coolness (4’s). He had
been backed like a certainty at Moonee Valley only
to run very badly, but many of these imported
horses are untrustworthy brutes.
Suomi (Bst. 111 b.), The Tyrant (Bst. 41b.) and
Spearage (7st. 41 o.) are likely to run well in the
V.K.C. Bagot Handicap at llcmington on New Year’s
Day, and Mctellus (9st 91b.), and Adrift (9st. 71b.)
read attractively in the fetandish. The double may
go to Metellus and Suomi.

maniike style, has 9st. 2lb. in the Perth Cup. He
is a four-year-old chestnut stallion by Juggernaut—

prepared Burthymic in his two- and three-year-old

“Centurion”: That holy “sport ” the
Aga Khan (B. 17/12/’25) is apparently not content
with pouching the big prizes of the English and
trench racing world. He has decided to invade
the U.S.A., wnere the saint is less sought after than
the shekel. He has announced that ail the horses
bred at his studs in Ireland and t rance during 1925
will be devoted to American entries, so it will be
a couple of years before Uncle Sam will have to
seriously consider ways and means of getting the
better of the invader. The hereditary spiritual—
and largely temporal—ruler of India’s great Moslem
population occupies a weird position in his western
rOle of racehorse-owner. About the only parallel the
writer can recall was the Rev. James Legard, a
Yorkshire parson who event, in for Hunt Club racing
and had more than one try to win the Grand
National.
“Bulimba”: Attorney-General Mullau is
one of the few Queensland Labor politicians who
never go rating, although his department controls
all the courses. It's a case of noblesse oblige with
Mullan. “I love to see a good race,” he told an
interviewer, “and I used to have a little bet on my
fancy; but when I took charge of this department
betting disputes began to come before me for
settlement, so I thought it best to cut the races
out.” Mullan’s colleague, Stopford, is a shrewd
judge of the game which gives him opportunities
of indulging his playful humor. Being at Albion
Park racecourse, the Home Secretary stood up on a
bookmaker’s stand to survey the crowd. A young
pressman, pretending to mistake him for a book-
maker, came up and asked, “What price Early
Election?” “Can’t bet you,” said Stopford promptly,
“but I’ll lay you a good price Brazen Boy!” A
horse named Brazen Boy was running that day, so
perhaps Stopford did not mean to be personal.

“FY7” : While 10,©00 guineas is no great
shakes for a flat-racing prad in these times, it is
something out of the common for a jumper. That
sum was given for Silvo last October, and the
expensive moke soon
got some of it back-
for his owner by win-
ning the Becher Steeple-
chase at Liverpool
(Eng.), a month later.
Silvo is in the next
Liverpool Grand
National, and as there
is a thundering lot of
money to be picked up
during the off season
of racing under
National Hunt Club
rules, the experiment
may justify itself. All
the same, it is a ter-
rible lot of money to
watch “flying in the
air,” as a famous
punter once put it.
* *
“Hotham”: Al-
- the only praise-
worthy achievement of
the Vic. Parliament
last session was an
amendment of the
Game Act limiting the
murderous activity of
the pothunter. It pro-
hibits the use of that
game-butcher’s pride,
the magazine shotgun,
and its wicked cousin,
the The
ensuing howl indicated
that half rural Vic-
toria was armed with
the forbidden weapons,
and the panic-stricken
authorities have rushed
to suspend the regula-
tion against their use.
The use of the auto-
matic is harmful, not
only to the game,
which is “browned”
indiscriminately by the
machine-gun fire, but
to good shooting, the
essence of which is the
picking off a single
bird at a time. With
the double barrel, the
sportsman not only
selects his two birds
from the flock deliber-
ately, but has time to
see where they fall
and retrieve them if
wounded. That is not
possible with the in-
discriminate auto.,
which probably lets
half a dozen winged
birds get away for every
one cleanly killed.
The lads who buckle straps round their
petrol-waggons to keep them together had another
pleasant afternoon at Maroubra (N.S.W.) Speedway
on December 26. The programme was shorter and
bria'hter than on the opening day, speeds were five
miles an hour faster all round, and there were
two accidents —slight affairs, as it turned out, but
any mishap at a mile and a half a minute is super-
charged with doom so far as the spectators are
concerned. The first was when Gartner, who hails
from S, A us., shot over the handlebars of his Harley
and beat all records for the running-jump; and the
second was when A. E. Cooper, a Melbourne youth,
shed the tread of his front tyre and developed a
wobble that just missed causing several deaths.
Among tiie motor-cyclists, Cecil Brown and Spencer
Stratton, riding Indians, shared the speed honors,
both getting very near 10(1 m.p.h. in their fastest
laps; but a more remarkable performance was that
of Stratford, who on a little Dougias of a third
the power attained 95 m.p.h. The car-drivers, though
more spectacular, were less speedy, the fastest lap,
by Hope Bartlett’s Sunbeam, being at just over 90
m.p.h. The scrupulously polite way in which all
the four-wheelers made way for a faster competitor
coming up behind was beautiful to see, and must
have revived the faith in human nature of spectators
accustomed to another sort of racecourse.
“Trox”; Several thousand feet of good, stout
timber went to waste when the Speedway people
provided seats for patrons of the more expensive
enclosures around the track. The commencement of
a race is the signal for every man, woman and
child within eyeshot of the Speedway to stand on
tip-toe; the seats only come in handy to add a
few inches to the stature of those who have paid
to use the furniture in another way. The only
people who get an intelligible view of a race —being
able to see the letters attached to competing machines
—are those on the front rail, whose bodies effectively
screen the portion of the track in front of them
from the eyes of everybody behind them. If every-
body would sit down, everybody could see every-
thing. Another thing that needs attention, too, is the
provision of registered colors for the car-driving
competitors. The motor-cyclists now have their
colors, and there should be no difficulty in giving the
public a similar clue to the identity of the ladies
and gentlemen who drive Snorto-Spaghettis and
eight-cylinder super-charged Fords.
* * * *
Last year Bob Spears, the Australian
cyclist who spends most of his time in France, sent
to Melbourne a team of bike-pushers which included
the veteran “Woody” Hedspath, Lucien Faucheux,
former amateur champion of France, Ernest Vedrine,
the Belgian, and Jim Nagel, described as “of France,”
although he is as Australian as Spears. The team
did not ride up to expectations, Nagel in par-
ticular showing such mediocre form that many pro-
nounced him a dud. Spears, who won the world’s
championship in 1920 and the Grand l'rix de Paris
in 1920, 1921 and 1923, stoutly declared that Nagel
was a good man and would prove it. Time has
justified them both. A few weeks ago Nagel began
to assert himself, and lately he has been cleaning
up all and sundry in handicap and scratch races.
* * * *
There wasn’t much of a crowd at Sydney
Stadium w'hen the Victorian middleweight, All
Stewart, met dusky “Tiger” Payne for the second
time, but it was a thrilling fight. “Tiger” is
probably the wildest swinger in captivity, and after
a few rounds he seemed to have worn himself out.
At the end of the 10th session the referee asked him
if he was fit to continue. But he always hopped up
from his chair seemingly as st ang as ever. More-
over, his apparent helplessness on the ropes, two or
three times, was assumed, Stewart’s punches being
taken on a rolling head, With not enough weight
in them to have damaged a white man, let alone a
coon whose mug is nearly all heavy bone. Payne is
a sullen-looking negro—there is no smile on the face
of this “Tiger”—and his methods are crude, but
there is a lot of fire in his swings, and only Stewart's
cleverness with his headtisway enabled him to
preserve his chin till the 14th round. Then the
white was too tired to protect himself and was
dropped for six. In the 15th a hurricane of punches
sent him down for the count.

No one can blame Vic. Richardson for
South Australia’s defeat in its first Adelaide match
against N.S.W.—it went down by an innings and
99. Vic made 59 and 61 —top score in each innings
—and fielded beautifully. For S.A. v. Vic. he made
28 and 52 ; and for The Rest v. Australia 56 and
19. His scores for his State in first-class matches
last season were 123, 17, 14 and 28 v. Vic. ; 100,
125, 4 and 1 v. N.S.W.; 87, 28 and 43 v. England ;
and for Australia v. England 42, 18, 138, 8, 4 and 0.
Aggregate, 780; average, 45.88. He has assuredly
earned a place in the Australian XV.
* * * *
“S. Gfumm”; It is a matter of opinion
whether Ellis or O’Connor is the better wicket-keeper
(B. 24/12/’25), but surely “George” will admit that
O’Connor is more consistent with the bat. Consider
the Queenslander’s scores last season: 32, 2, 141 and
47 for Queensland v. N.S.W.; 29 and 66 n.o. for
Queensland v. England; 50 and 40 for an Australian
XI v. England. Aggregate, 405; average, 67.5. In
the Queensland v. England match, O’Connor caught,
Hobbs off Hornibrook and missed only 2 byes in a
total of 522 ; in the game v. N.S.W. in which he
made the the Queensland captain caught
3 of the 15 Ma Staters who lost their wickets in
the two essays, and kept the byes down to 2 in the
first innings, which realised 290, and nil in the
second (4 for 255). This season in his only two
knocks at the moment of writing, he has made ‘
103 for Queensland v. M.L. and 44 v. N.S.W., and
his work behind the sticks has been admirable. If
the Australian XV selectors dismiss his claims with-
out having seen him, here is one who will say the
man hasn’t had a fair deal.
* * * *
Winning the toss against N.S.W. on
Saturday, Victoria had lost 6 wickets for 251 at the
close of a painfully slow day’s cricket. Both Ryder
and Hendry failed with the bat, but Mayne made
25, Woodfull 53 with stubborn caution and Ponsford
68 with confidence. Five wickets were down for
200, at Which point a stand by Love and Baring put
a much better aspect on the game from the home
side’s viewpoint, the pair keeping up their wickets
till time-call with 56 and 28 respectively. The real
feature of the day’s play was the bowling of Macartney,
who probably did more to make himself a certainty
for England by taking 5 wickets for 49 than he
could have done by a batting display, though he has
plenty of time to supplement it, with the latter.
It was fortunate for N.S.W. as well as himself that
the great batsman of a few years ago, who came on
as second change, was able to resurrect the proficiency
that made him such a useful all-round man early
in his career, for neither Gregory or Mailev captured
a wicket; it is only fair to add that the former had
the worst of luck, in that he often beat the batsmen
resultlessly and two chances were missed off him.
On Monday Love (115), Baring (57) and Hartkopf
(54 n. 0.), took the Vic. score to 413. Macartney
finished with 7 for 85 —a really great average, for
the wicket was perfect.
PLAYING THE GAME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“J. B. Hobbs, the famous cricketer, gave an
address to prisoners in Norwich Gaol. A prisoner,
moving a vote of thanks, said: *lf we had all played
the game like Hobbs, we should not be here.’ ”
— Cable.
Dim grows the light, the lecture done,
In that great prison hall;
Behind the rest still lingers one
In bitterness and gall
Who sore deplores the vanished sun
And freedom’s distant call.
And “Oh,” he says, in a voice that throbs,
“If I’d only played the game like Hobbs!”
His gaze so bleak, his face so grey
Bespeak the troubled soul;
“Alas,” he sighs, “and alack the day
That dropped me in this hole!
And curse the fool who must display
Such a fat and' tempting roll!
But oh, the cheers of wondering mobs
If I’d only played the game like Hobbs 1
“If half the cunning he has shown
Could e’er be mine to use,
From hungry dogs I’d lift a bone,
Or lucre from the Jews;
For at stealing—runs—he’s on his own,
Or so I read the news.
Wealth might be mine in chunks and gobs
If I’d only played the game like Hobbs 1
“ ’Twould need some new and nifty grips
To hold me then, don’t doubt;
They’d never trap me in the slips,
All artful ones I’d clout,
Though now,” and sadly drooped his lips,
“I’d gladly be ‘run out.’
Oh 1 Oh!” he wailed with a burst of sobs,
“If I’d only played the game like Hobbs?”

THE INKY WAY.
Bulimba : A Brisbane daily will be striking
. euous trouble one of these days if it persists in
mixing its photos. its latest achievement was to
d °°* ar dinal O'Donnell under the heading
thief Rat Catcher”—an official just, appointed by
the city council.
Ricardo”: The flotation of a comjjany with a
capital of £400,000 to acquire Truth recalls a
prophecy of the early days. When John Norton, after
a series of hard lights, obtained possession of the
paper, the old book-keeper in the Sydney office said
cautiously: “If Mr. Norton looks after the paper —
and himself—he’ll make £5OO a year out of it.”
He was well within the mark !
“Uramao”: Charles A. Marris, who went from
associate-editor of the Christchurch Sun to the
editorship of the Wellington Times some eight
months ago, has been appointed managing director
of the paper. It is becoming quite a habit in
M.L. to rope in editors for the financial side of
journals. This recognition by Big Business that
financial ability and the poetical nature may go
together has heartened M.L. bards no end.
“Clerk” : Victoria got another Bulletin the other
day—on the last Reso. train, Roy Gollan, assistant
publicity officer to the Vie. railways, introduced the
Reso Bulletin, a morning paper whose news con-
sists oi information concerning the arrangements for
each day’s tour, with particulars and history of the
district to be inspected: The Reso sheet, of course,
won’t displace Clapp’s interesting and expensive
Railways Magazine, which Gollan also supervises.
Sydney Telegraph sees more , big changes, George
Cockerill, of the Melbourne Age, succeeding Tom
Heney as editor; and on that follow several others.
Cockerill, who got his early training in Bendigo, has
been the Syrnes’ chief leader-writer for many
years, and looked like Schuler’s successor in the
chair. He has the health and hustle which the
thoroughly literary Heney didn’t have in sufficient
measure to lift the Telegraph out of the pit into
which it has fallen—or been pushed.
_“Mabet”: Concerning the origin of “wowser” ("B.
li/12/’25). In Webster’s Dictionary among the
obsolete and little used words appears: “Wow (n. and
v.), Howl, Wail or Mew. Scotch and Dial. English.’’
A wowser, obviously, is one who wows; I believe
John Norton was the first to use it in Australia and
the late Cardinal Moran gave it a boost by referring
to certain politicians as “wowsers.” Strangely
enough, many Methodists consider that the term
signifies an adherent of their church—they insist
that it is a corruption of “wiser.”
Quiet, pedantic John Liddell Kelly, editor at one
time or another of almost every paper in the
Rickety Isles, has handed in his last leader. He
was responsible for one book of verses, “Heather and
Pern,” which placed him on the literary map, but
his inclination in verse, as in prose, was to string
words nicely together in such wise as to effectually
deprive them of meaning, lest meaning something
they might prove offensive to somebody. The habit
of crypticism inclined him, perhaps naturally, to
an interest in biblical prophecies and that sort of
thing, and he wrote much on such subjects towards
the end, which occurred at 75.
“Alwyn”: Hugh D. Mclntosh’s present part-
proprietorship of Sydney Suniiay Times is not his
. first association with inewspa poring. When the
ex-fight promoter was nine or so he ran away from
home and went to Broken Hill. There he helped
in installing the machinery in the Barrier Miner
office, and when the paper made its appearance he
sold the first copies on the streets. The Miner’s
founders were Henry Fenton, who had been overseer
of The Bulletin’s compositors, and Syd Knight,
who had been “father of the chapel” in the S. M.
Herald office. Both had in earlier years worked in
Toowoomba—hence their association.
“Wooroolt”: It was a pressman in the Federal
Parliamentary gallery who, in a moment of soul-
weariness or liver, looked at the prosperous curva-
tures of the Government party and muttered, more
to himself than to the fellow-scribe alongside: “Look
at ’em, the serried ranks of Stodge.” Struck by
the phrase, the other wrote it on a slip of paper
and, in jovial mood, sent it down to Bill Mahoney,
Labor member for Balmain, who that same after-
noon concluded a fiery attack on the Government
by pointing dramatically at its members and de-
nouncing them as “the serried ranks of Stodge.”
The originator of the phrase sat up and began to
believe in telepathy. Next day all the papers but
one repeated the magic words, the exception being
the Argus, an ironic circumstance, since it was an
Argus man who had invented them.
“Ricardo”: The rapid succession of editions of the
afternoon papers has killed the old “extraordinaries”
which used to be rushed out on the slightest provo-
cation. There is an evening paper in an Australian
capital which once issued a special edition to
announce that Maniapoto was sneezing; the news, it
reported later, cast a feeling of gloom over the
city,” for Maniapoto was then favorite for the Mel-
bourne Cup. By the way, on the Sunday after the
Derby Day riots in Melbourne the Herald and Sun
ran out “extraordinaries,” which gave them an excuse
for publishing the Cup acceptances. Under the queer
Victorian law the riots justified the issue of papers
on Sunday, but the Courts have held that the
“dinkum oil” about the Cup is not of urgent public
importance within the meaning of an Act which was
certainly not drafted by pews editors.
“Jog”: Hobart News has almost given up the ghost.
It has ceased to appear each evening, and now is to
come out only on Saturday nights, when the sport-
ing results ensure a ready sale. The News lasted
18 months. Just when it began Hobart’s biggest
slump in a quarter of a century started, too, and
business-houses would not spend money on advertis-
ing. For the first time in 18 years Hobart has now
only one daily paper—the Mercury. Launceston,
with half the population of the capital, supports
two. About 14 journalists are affected by the
fate of the News, and about 60 men in the other
branches. The losses on the venture are said to
exceed £30,000. They will have to be borne by
the company, managed by J. E. Davidson, which
runs also the News, in Adelaide and the Barrier
Miner at Broken Hill—the latter the company’s
strongest prop.
Melbourne journalists are up in arms against
Premier Allan for giving them the lie direct. All
the morning papers published a report of an inter-
view with Allan in which he was made to say that
he saw ho chance of a compromise with the Leg.
Council over the rejection of the taxation proposals.
They all agreed that he said there would be either
an election or a Labor Government, and that he
added: “Don’t be surprised if it’s Labor.” When
he was tackled in the House about giving such a
tip to the press and not to Parliament, Mr. Allan
did not say he had been misreported—he just de-
(lared that he had not been interviewed at all.
Then he rushed to a taxi and took train for home,
leaving behind him five responsible pressmen who are
agreed that they did have an interview with him —
all together. A Premier or any other politician
isn’t likely to get out of trouble of that sort
without some scars.
“Guy Fane”: When the hand of the City Council
falls on the south side of Park-street, early in the
new year, one of the landmarks of Sydney will
crumble—to wit, No. 7, young Bill McNamara-’s little
bookshop, which has been for long a meeting-place
of reform workers and intelligentsia. No matter
what time of the day you venture into the shop,
you will find a group of folk discussing books and
the art of living and other things which are soul-food
to the highbrows. It was Bill’s father, the late
W, H. McNamara, who first sold in the Domain the
pioneer organ of the Radicals in New South Wales,
an unpretentious publication edited and published hy
Bob Winspear. Bill, junior, recently presented to
the Mitchell Library a bound file of the paper. His
mother, Mrs. Bertha McNamara—mother of Henry
Lawson’s widow’ and of Premier Lang’s wife—-has
been accumulating mild fame during the past 40
years by her oral and literary powers. The dis-
appearance of the tiny shop will be a sorrow’ful event
to many.

A multitude of glorious spectacles at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s on Saturday failed to con-
ceal the fact that “Aladdin” is deficient in
histrionic talent —even in that variety which
achieves its ends by flinging custard-pies
and walking through the wall instead of
through the doorway. Gus Bluett’s cheerful
and artistic Wishee is hereby granted an
exemption; but somebody has made Bruce
Green’s Widow Twankey an outdffbr clinic
for seedy wheezes, and Jennie Benson’s
Aladdin was born nearer Shaftesbury-avenue
than the odorous coasts of legend. Floie
Allan, whose drawing-power in comic opera
may be estimated at many kelvins, has no
scope for her elastic talent, and the acting
of June Elvidge, the film star whom Pauline
Frederick brought across the water, shows
all the variety of an ice-cream turntable in a
sundae-sliop. She was Princess Zobeide.
Grafton Williams’s whiskers, however, helped
him to Grand Vizier effectively, Rupert
Hazel Abanazared well, and Bernard Man-
ning made a melodious Emperor of China.
* * # *
Having dealt with the principals, one turns
with awe and admiration to the spectacular
remainder. Messrs. Coleman, Upward and
Little have recreated in color all the romance
of China that our forefathers got from the
woodcut illustrations that adorned the first
edition of “Lord Macartney’s Mission to
Peking”—this critic wagers that the book
gave them their inspiration. A well-trained
chorus shook a liealtliy-looking lot of legs
in sublimated bathing costumes through the
bazaars and yamens of the Orient; Maie
Baird and Archie Thompson had a hilarious
romp, described on the programme as a
dance; Walter Nilsson justified his claim to
be the world’s master unicyclist, and the
Twelve Wonderful Williamson Girls —what
a family the fellow has !, —swung themselves
across the auditorium on ribbons to the de-
light of all the house except the front stalls.
In the confusion the Flying Palace departed
for Egypt and lost itself, and the final cur-
tain guillotined the immortal story in an un-
satisfactory and inartistic manner. Why
panto, playwrights can never tell a fairy-
story in an intelligible fashion remains a
mystery and wonder.
* * * *
The comment of the google-eyed child who
sat at this critic’s elbow summed up the
situation. “It doesn’t matter if I talk at
this picture-show, does it?” he murmured.
** * *
Instead of looking up the salacities that
filled the front-row stalls at pantomimes with
bald-headed bachelors, Hugh J. Ward went
into a meadow and got inspiration from his
fairy great-grandmother for his excellent
“Jack and the Beanstalk” at the Melbourne
Princess’s. This Father of Three herewith
burns a joss-stick in Ward’s praise. The
result is good. The deathless story is faith-
fully told, the interpellated ballets are attrac-
tive without being overwhelming, and tae
fun provided by Charlton Morton as the
King, Jimmy Godden as his major domo and
Joe Brennan as the Dame would melt the
heart of a baby-farmer. As Jack Elsie
Prince is a nuggety “boy,” whose physical
energy and vainglory is equal to tackling a
stableful of giants; Nellie Barnes is a Prin-
cess Sylvia right out of an 1880 edition of
Grimm’s fairy tales, and Ida Newton is a
suitably stagey Fairy Hyacinth; there is an
infant chorus that works solemnly to achieve
an effect which is devastatingly funny; there
is a cow that is very much alive; real lions
instead of stuffed ones; and Jimmy Godden
sings of proletarians and capitalists in a
way that should make any further action
under the Deportation Act supererogatory.
Despite the excellence of the Noah’s Ark
ballet and others, the management, this
critic wagers, spent on its exhibit fewer
ducats than have been squandered on less
effective musico-jazz comedies. Producers of
£300,000 spectacles should take a short tram-
ride to see how it is done.
*i* V •!»
Melbourne Theatre Royal audiences are
still worshipping at the shrine of Gladys
Moncrieff —this week in “The Maid of the
Mountains.” The romantic story of the
brigand who was so heroic in the field and
so vacillating in the lists of love does not
stale by repetition. Gladys is in voice again ;
the moisture of farewell may be in her eye,
but it has not gathered around her larnyx.
Claude Flemming is a robust, humorous and
musical Baldasarre, and John Ralston makes
up for unobtrusive acting by singing with
penetrating charm. Arthur Sinclair, as
Mayor of Santo, isn’t any better at making
speeches than the average occupant of civic
posts, but Arthur Stigant and Leslie Hol-
land are worthy of their hire. As that
debonair and cynical hedonist, the Gov-
ernor of Santo, who must snatch a jest even
out of the wreckage of his professional
career, Stigant is excellent; and Holland
as his aide shows how a real actor can fool
fantastically through a part without losing
his grip on the character he is paid to rep-
resent. On Saturday Donna Gladys will re-
commence her good-byes in “The Merry
Widow.” Andrew Higginson has temporarily
abandoned the sordid paths of commerce
to appear as Prince Danilo, the rOle in
which he made his first Australian appear-
ance many harvest-moons ago.

In “The Music-box Revue” (Melbourne
Palace) the Stork drops an infant of a riper
age than is usual on these occasions, and the
infant finds the plot, and the plot gets stolen;
after which the serious business of the even-
ing is handed over to the care of Harry Angers,
chief fun-provider; Les Pearce, the most
Herculean musical-comedy hero that ever
batted chest-notes around an auditorium;
Madge White, no improvement on Dot Brun-
ton, who preceded her in Sydney; Harry
Burgess ; Compton Coutts ; Mary Gannon ;
Winifred Dalle ; and one of the most beau-
teous corps of chorus-ladies this critic has
seen paraded of late years. The show may
be recommended. The songs are elegantly
dressed, even if they might be better sung.
Madge White has an anxious manner, and
is not a queen of melody, and Winifred Dalle
isn’t, either; but the men make up for any
deficiency on the shingled side. “If Men
Played Cards Like Women,” as portrayed
by Harry Burgess, Harry Angers, Bert Es-
cott and Compton Coutts, is a masterpiece
of nonsense; and at least three other play-
ettes sandwiched in between the dancing are
all well above the average.

All that need be said at present about
“Polly with a Past,” at Melbourne King's, is
that the comedy is light but bright, and that

able to provide Polly with a future.

“On Tuesday last Mr. Handel’s Sacred
Grand Oratoria, ‘The Messiah,’ was per-
formed in the New Music Hall, in Fishamble-
street; the best judges allow it to be the

afforded to the admiring crowded audience.
“POLLY WITH A PAST,” AT MEL-
BOURNE KINO’S.
Renee Kelly as Polly, Antony Holies as Rew
Van Zile.
The Sublime, the Grand and the Tender,
adapted to the most elevated, majestick, and
moving words, conspired to transport and
charm the ravished Heart and Ear.” This
critic for present purposes has nothing to
add to this first notice of the work printed in
Faulkner’s Journal, Dublin, April 17,
1742, except to amend the date to Tuesday
week last and to state that it was faithfully
rendered by the massed cohorts of the Mel-
bourne Philharmonic—their 100th essay—
under Alberto Zelman’s baton ; that the ex-
quisite accompaniment of the Symphony
Orchestra made this listener temporarily for-
get his troubles and the garish decoration of
the Exhibition Building; that Dorothy
Humphreys’ soprano was sweet and clear,
but occasionally lacking in vivacity; that
Norman Bradshaw’s tenor was expressive,
but not strong enough; that Kennerley Rum-
ford’s bass was singularly ill at ease, and
that Dame Clara Butt s vast organ notes
eclipsed the instrument of wood and metal
standing against the wall beheld her. W. F.
G. Steele was organist, and Bertha Jorgenseu
held the chief bow. On Christmas night the
performance was repeated.

Some genius has made an interesting unity
of Melbourne Bijou’s programme this week.
In the first part some fascinating films of
the birth of radio, automobiles, submarines
and high-explosive illustrate the kind of
jim-jams the first quarter of the twentieth
century inflicted on our fathers. In the
next item the Veterans of Variety show us
how our forebears managed to forget their
troubles. In the final section Gayle Wyer
and his jazzy corps of revue artists help
the present generation to escape momentarily
from the gathering fantods of the times. The
last-mentioned show provides uproarious
farce, smart leg-shaking and indifferent sing-
ing. George Campbell, .Take Friedman (who
was 30 years ago in 'Melbourne), Arthur
Slater (the original whistler in “The Belle
of New York”), Florence Hinton (the ori-
ginal singer of “Good-bye. Mignonette”) and
Lily Burnand (she let “Two Little Girls in
Blue” loose upon a sentimental world) are
the Veterans, and the reception given to
their efforts shows that ft the British people
have changed their taste in hats and govern-
ments the charm of these relics of the past
remains untarnished.

The only Melbourne playhouse unaffected
by the earthquake of Christmas changes is
the Athenaeum, where “Give and Take” con-
tinues to foot the primrose way.

The edifice described in “The Mansion of
Aching Hearts” at Melbourne Majestic is
not a war-service home. It is a spiritual
mansion compounded of mother-love, wifely
constancy and other virtues on which Holly-
wood is accustomed to speak with authority.
“East of Broadway,” the supporting film, is
better stuff. The sentiment is trite, but the
action provides a multitude of thrills. Hoyt's
De Luxe has a similar happy mixture in
“Paths to Paradise,” starring Betty Coipp-
son, and “The Lucky Horseshoe,” featuring
the redoubtable Tom Mix. The latter item
opens with Tom on horseback and, with an
armful of girl, pursuing and catching an ex-
press train. The interest"'of the rest of the
picture doesn’t flag, either.
Good character-drawing, a situation that
builds its comedy on the narrow foundations
of the foibles of shut-in lives, quaintness in
dialogue and a plot sluggish in idea and
action are the make-up of Eden Phillpotts’s
“Farmer’s Wife,” presented to Sydney at
the Palace for the first time on Boxing
Night. The story concerns one Samuel
Sweetland, a well-to-do farmer of the Eng-
lish West Country, who is searching for a
wife to replace the model of domestic virtue
he lost two years before —her last treasured
words had to do w-ith the airing of Samuel’s
underpants. In the first act the farmer dis-
cusses the possible brides about the neigh-
borhood with his housekeeper Araminta
Drench (Doris Johnstone), and four are
marked down for pursuit. They are Louisa
Windeatt, a fox-hunting widow; Thirza
Tapper, a genteel spinster filled with good
works and an inordinate pride in the bath-
room of her villa residence; Mary Hearn, the
near-young village postmistress; and a
widow lady who is heard of but not seen,
being about her business at Dawlish. Full
of conceit of himself, the farmer sets about
his wooing; but one by one the ladies re-
ject his advances, and bit by bit Samuel’s
assurance falls from him, till at length, when
he comes to the unconsidered Araminta
Drench, with the offer of liis hand and farm,
he does so with his heart in his mouth ; and
Araminta, who has always admired him,
picks up the fallen rags of his pride and re-
clothes him. If the renewed garment were
thin in places, three elegant patches came to
hand just before the final curtain, when two
of the ladies and a telegram from the Daw-
lish pub-keeper tell Samuel that his pro-
posal has been reconsidered favorably. For
minor interest there is a tangled love-affair
of the farmer’s two daughters, the handsome
and flashing Petronell and the sweet-toned
Sibley. The play has humor, but it is not
very kindly; the situations are amusing, but
one feels that the author is holding up his
characters to be laughed at and not with.
The best parts of the dialogue are the unex-
pected patches of poetry, like sudden gleams
of flowers in rocky places. There is some
delightful grouping in the first act; and a
flash of pure inspiration in Petronell’s exit
into the garden with Dick.
* * * •
As Thirza Tapper Susan Richmond holds
half the second act, and is perfection in her
buzzing trepidation for the success of her
great party. Very good, too, was Cliurdles
Ash (Edwin Brett) as the old farm-servant
who is a woman-hater. Townsend Wliitling
was the blustering, blundering honest farmer
of the piece, and his Samuel Sweetland was
a capital if somewhat heavyweight piece of
work. Eardley Turner faithfully etched in
the small part of Dunnybrig, and
the young lovers, Richard Coaker qnd George
Smerdon, were effectively handled by Graham
Stuart and Reginald Newson. Mary Mac-
gregor was the shy Sibley, Frances Cave the
more vital Petronell, Doris Johnstone the
sweet Araminta, Violet Ley the fence-soaring
Louisa Windeatt, and Emmeline Orford the
postwoman whose fit of hysterics is memor-
able. Douglas Vigors, the unregenerate old
Henry Coaker, and Scott Edwards, the
clergyman, were others who did passable
work.
“Cinderella,” one of the oldest and per-
haps quite the most pantomimed of all fairy-
tales, began a whirling season at Sydney
Opera House on Boxing Day, when the im-
possibility of keeping a good girl down (in
the scullery) when there is a fairy god-
mother and a Prince Charming in the parlor
was demonstrated as convincingly as ever
and with all the gorgeous accessories and
humorous irrelevances that tradition de-
mands. Amy Rochelle makes a delightful
Prince, and a voice like hers would have been
a splendid asset to any European royalty
who had the ill-luck to lose his crown in the
Great War. Rona Phillips is a daintily
appealing Cinderella, albeit her voice is lack-
ing in volume, and her cat Cutie (William
Hassan) is about the most engaging speci-
men of footlights fauna this paper remem-
bers. Willie Lancet exploits a rich vein of
humor as Buttons. Elsie Parkes presents a
piquant Dandini, and the Baron Mumm
(Walter George), with his two daughters
Maximum and Minnimumm (May Beatty
and Maxwell Carew) burlesqued a vulgarian
family with great success. Leonard Byron
deserves a line of approval for his Demon
Nightshade, and Coppem and Grabbem (Pic
and Alf) hand out the low comedy in gener-
ous chunks. Other commendable features are
Fullers’ Royal Wonders, a troupe of clever
child acrobats, and Clivalli’s Miniature
Circus of ponies and dogs. The Enchanted
Lake is genuinely alluring and the Crystal
Coach as dinky a conveyance as ever carried
a Cinderella to a ball.
At Sydney Cri. “Secrets” is entering upon
its closing week. After that there will be a
brief revival of “Within the Law,” witli
Muriel Starr as Mary Turner and Frank
Harvey as Joe Garson.

Although it was long after 11 before
Sydney Fullers’ emptied itself of “Robinson
Crusoe’s” first-night audience, one-fourth of
the pantomime remained untouched. An
elaborate, colorful affair of 15 scenes, pro-
lific in carefree songs and breezy patter, and
containing some good examples of the scenic
artist’s craft and a gay ballet, it was not
until almost two hours after the commence-
ment that Crusoe was shipwrecked. The
necessity for ruthlessly “cutting” the rest of
the programme occurring to those in charge,
an important connecting scene was deleted
and the curtain rushed up for the midway
helping. Then the management evidently
studied the situation, and before the threads
of the story were again taken up a tedious
gap spoilt an otherwise excellent entertain-
ment. Probably by the time this appears in
print everything has been adjusted and order
restored. Apart from the management’s
attempt to give more than was possible, the
only defect is a strain of coarseness
which mars what ought to be a children’s
show. Queenie Pauli was admirably suited
for the part of Crusoe, and Neva Carr-Glyn
was an appealing and winsome Polly Per-
kins. There was the usual good supply of
comedians, of whom Mike Connors (Baron
Deadbroke) scored best, with Harry Huley
as the Dame, Nat Phillips (Will Atkins) and
Bess Bent (Angelina) running very close
behind.
** * *
For the 56tli time the Philharmonics pre-
sented the thunders and the tendernesses of
“The Messiah” last week in the Town Hall.
The impressive work never fails to draw a
crowded audience, and no doubt in the year
ISBS, when Nellie M'elba flung out the,
golden banner of her voice in “I Know That
My Redeemer Liveth,” the Philharmonic
interpretation was heard by breathless hun-
dreds. . Certainly Rene Maxell’s singing of
the aria last week was one of the tremendous
moments of the production. There was
spirituality and an exaltation in the voice
that stirred the house. More than ever the
satin smoothness and pure quality of the
soprano’s voice struck this listener. Joseph
Bradley conducted his forces, and the choir
sang with the freedom and power that only
comes with intimate knowledge of the work.
Oliver King was the basso, and the new
tenor Lance Jeffree was a distinct acquisi-
tion. The contralto music was sung on one
night by Virginia Bassetti and on Christmas
night by Miss Gillon, of Tasmania. Both
voices have attractive qualities.
❖ * *
When Lily Morris, the English comedienne
at Sydney Tivoli, steps from the wings there
is no switching on of soft lights, and the
orchestra does not murmur little lullabies.
For Lilian is a boisterous member of the
Marie Lloyd school and serves up her turns
with a zip that will be appreciated by sun-
burned visitors. Katrina and Joan are a
pair of classical dancers who do their job
gracefully; and a collection of cockatoos piay
circus tricks which win applause. Connie
Arbuckle, the Ziegfeld Folly girl, finishes up
at the e ; nd of the week, and Mantells’ quaint
mannikins will also cease their antics at the
same time.

The Prince Edward was a sanctuary for
music-lovers on Christmas Night, when a
restful programme soothed the tired and
helped the overfed to drowse contentedly.
Alfred O’Shea and Saidie Grainger-Brood
were the brightest stars of the night. The
former aroused enthusiasm with Verdi’s
“Celeste Aida,” and the popular soprano
scored with “Caro Nome” and a selection
from “Rigoletto.” Will Prior’s stick led the
orchestra through several airs from grand
opera, and Leslie Harvey effectively juggled
with the keys of the grand organ.

The “Bucket of Blood,” a notorious
thieves’ kitchen in San Francisco’s China-
town, forms a sinister background to “Paths
to Paradise” at Sydney Hoyt’s. At the same
house a down-and-out rural parson whose
salary is below the basic wage is saying
"Thank you” to his parishioners who keep
his cupboard from becoming bare. J. M.
Barrie’s classic, “Peter Pan,” has been
turned into a film, and hordes of youngsters
released from school are making a raid upon
the Lyceum to view the whimsical little fel-
low who refused to grow up. There is no
lull in the storming of Zcebrugge at the
Crystal Palace, and “Scaramouche” at the
Prince Edward threatens to emulate Tenny-
son’s “Brook.”
Poverty
Point
“S.G.”: Arthur Styan, good actor and
good fellow, has taken his last call. Though
not Australian-born, he spent most of his
59 years in Australia, and it would take a
column to catalogue his parts. He began
in Bland Holt melodrama, and towards the
end was posing for the pitchers. Some of
his best work was done in “Mid-Channel”
and “The Passing of the Third Floor Back,”
but, craftsman though he was, he had all
too feiv opportunities of appearing in such
plays.
“Ancient Prompter”: “Monsieur Beau-
caire” is being revived by the Firm with
Mrs. Pitt Rivers as Lady Mary Carlisle and
Frank Harvey in the title-role beloved afore-
time of Julius Knight. It is 22 years since
“Beaucaire” was first seen in Australia with
Knight and Maud Jeffries in the leading
parts, and about half that time since the
THE MODERN WAY
FIRST ACTOR : “Do you mean to tell me,
sirrr, that your — ah—wife didn’t say
good-bye to you?”
SECOND ACTOR: “Well, she didn’t speak her
lines. She went inside and —u m—waved
her hair!”
late Lewis Waller appeared here as Beau-
caire, of which he was the original English
exponent, with Madge Titheradge as Lady
Mary. The sentimental little costume-play
has had some sort of a vogue in England
and America as an opera for which Andre
Messager, composer of “Veronique” and many
another success, supplied the score.
“A.G.M.” (Load.) : Tbe new three-act
operetta “Paganini,” by Franz Lehar, deal-
ing with the life of the great virtuoso and
staged at the Johann Strauss Theatre in
Vienna, lias been an instant and complete
success. One of the main episodes concerns
Paganini’s love for the sister of Napoleon,
and liis fascination for other fair ones is
brought out with good effect. The orchestra-
tion is finer than anything the composer has
yet done, and more than once the atmosphere
of real opera is achieved. Lehar himself
conducted the first performance, and at its
close received an immense ovation from an
audience that in its appreciation of the re-
fined exotic music overlooked the occasional
dulness of the libretto.
“R.K.D.N.”: The course of matrimony
doesn’t run smooth for Lionel Atwill, whom
Australian playgoers saw as juvenile lead
in “The Whip.” Lionel’s present wife, Elsie
Mackay, is the daughter of Sam Mackay, the
late Westralian pastoralist and racehorse-
owner who nearly won a Caulfield Cup with
a nag named after his son-indaw. New
York cables announce that'a divorce case is
pending, with the husband as petitioner.
THE LOOPHOLE.
THE MODEL : “Marriage is a life sentence.”
THE ARTIST : “Yes, but sometimes remitted
for bad behavior.”
AtwilFs first wife was a well-known Eng-
lish actress, Phyllis Relph. The marriage
was dissolved, and on that occasion .Lionel
was the respondent.
“ Adamascus ”: “W.M.T.” asks (B.
30/12/’25) why the Firm doesn’t give us
revivals of “A Country Girl,” “Veronique”
and other old favorites. Judging by the
support two Rockhampton (C.Q.) amateur
companies received recently, the Big City
public would flock to these plays. At the
end of November “Veronique” was pro-
duced for two nights, and the local Winter-
garden, seating almost 3000 people, was
packed both times. A week later “A Country
Girl” was played for three nights, a hall
seating 1100 people being crowded on each
occasion. Rockhampton people accorded
better support to these revivals than to the
modern jazz products retailed by well-known
professionals who have visited the place this
year, and each amateur co. has a comfort-
able bank-balance to show for its very credit-
able exertions.
“A.G.M.’s” remarks from London:—
Mark Hambourg has been getting some knocks as
strong as his own from the critics. Ernest Newman
confessed that he had to look at the platform more
than once to make sure that it was Hambourg who
was rattling away, missing out a good third of
the notes, and reducing the Waldstein Sonata to
triviality. Newman’s final query was: “How is it
that a pianist who can on occasion drive a musical
point home so unerringly can also drive a musical
critic home by performances of definite banality?”
Not for a long time has any new singer received
such encouragement from the London press as that
given to Nada, a young Canadian soprano who sings
florid music with miraculous finish. The voice is
fresh, true and sympathetic, and the New York
Musical Courier, which is not always a safe guide
on matters of musical taste, has but summarised
the verdicts of London and the big provincial cities
in saying: “Evidently a new generation of Melbas
is arriving, of whom Nada is one.”
Not so long ago matinees in London were regarded
as outings for delicate old ladies and undeveloped
schoolgirls and it was not unusual to give the
principal artists a rest at these entertainments. The
war, the dangers of congested night traffic and in-
creased taxi fares have changed all that, and now it is
more difficult to get seats for an afternoon than an
evening performance, and many West-End shows with
slim evening attendances are able to balance the
treasury by crowded matinees. By mutual agree-
ment the managers divide the matinee days between
them.
The number of Australian musicians figuring per-
sistently in the November concerts is very flattering.
Florence Austral, Horace Stevens, Peter Dawson,
Arthur Mason, John Arnadio, Lily Payling, Malcolm
McEacharn, Max Pirani, Rosina Buckman, Wilma
Berkeley—there is not one of these who has not
received very high praise for work done at important
engagements during the recent autumn season. And
on the dramatic stage there are few holding higher
reputations or surer of drawing large audiences than
Madge Titheradge and Marie Lehr.
Kreisler’s only appearance in London for the winter
season drew a great audience to the Albert Hall.
There was no warmer enthusiast among the Aus-
trian artist’s admirers than Heifetz, Who had
tiavelled all the way from Aberdeen —522 miles —•
to hear the great master. On the following day
Heifetz had to play at Edinburgh—392 miles from
London—so that in making the double journey in
freezing weather he paid a compliment to Kreisler
which none could fail to appreciate. It has become
customary to speak of Albert Hall audiences as 10,000,
and some chroniclers have even leaped to 15,000
or 20,000 in describing Caruso or Melba concerts,
but as a matter of truth 7000 would fill every seat.
Mark Daly, who won many friends in Australia,
made his bow to London at the Duke of York’s on
November 18 in a part written wholly by himself,
the production being “Nicolette,” a comic opera
which was tried at Dublin during August. Then, as
now, a leading part was allotted to Kingsley Lark,
whose family was at one time well known in Sydney.
He is a nephew of Tremayne Lark, the painter, who
has long been settled at Monte Carlo. Mark, who
hails from Edinburgh, had a very creditable school
career and won many scholarships before going on
the stage at the age of 17. “Nicolette” (reminiscent
of “Falka,” which delighted Australia nearly 40
years ago) is of unequal merit and its chances of
success are about fifty-fifty, especially as mid-
November has been faced with a serious and inexplic-
able theatrical slump. But Mark Daly has made a
distinct personal success and installed himself in
the good graces of the London critics.
“Coot” : Melbourne’s first panto, was pro-
duced in May, 1850, in the old Queen’s
Theatre. A local production entitled “The
Goblin of the Gold Coast, or Harlequina and
the Melbournites in California,” it was writ-
ten and staged by Charles Young. There
was only one representation, and that as a
benefit to Young; but a thronged house over-
looked the deficiencies of the thing, and a
contemporary historian records that “Young
and his patrons parted at a late hour mutu-
ally delighted.”
“Caul-boy” : David Belbridge, formerly one
of Allan Wilkie’s band, sends Christmas
greetings from N’York, where he is taking
his old part of Trip in a chaste and expen-
sive showing of “The School for Scandal”
at the Little Theatre. The costumes are
alleged to have cost 60,000 dollars.
The theatre has been entirely redecorated for
the occasion, and in the lobby are displayed
antiques of the Sheridan period of fabulous
value. The explanation is that it is all
the hobby of a millionairess who was once
an actress and has here gratified her lust for
the limelight in a manner befitting her pres-
tige and her wealth.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Something like the
sausage-serial which was once run on The
Bulletin’s Red Page has been invented for
the stage by Roland Jeans: he has con-
structed a play with 200 alternative continu-
ations, and the audience is asked to state its
preference. The weird affair is called “Fate,”
and is included in Chariot’s Revue at the
Prince of Wales’s, London. Having got, for
instance, to the point of strangling a lady,
the actor turns to the audience to ask
whether it wants her strangled or not.
According to its verdict the play proceeds.
“Woorook”: The publication of a history
of Wirths’ Circus recalls an incident of the
bushranging era. In 1869 or thereabouts
a party of travelling musicians, journeying
north, reached Goonoo Goonoo Gap just
when “Thunderbolt” Ward chanced to be
there. The gentleman of the road bailed
them up and relieved them of £2O, explain-
ing the while that lie was hoping to way-
lay and seize the winner of the principal
event at the Tamworth races. Then he in-
vited his .victims to play for him, and, seat-
ing themselves on some rocks, they sadly
complied. After the al fresco concert they
asked him to return their cash, pleading
that they were on the rocks in more ways
than one. Thunderbolt promised in reply
that if he succeeded in capturing the race-
horse he was after would return the £2O,
and solemnly took their address, a Queens-
land towm. They departed sceptical and
depressed. But when they reached their
destination the postmaster handed them a
letter containing a money-order for the full
amount stolen. The leader of that musical
party was Wirth, founder of the circus.
“Pliilm Up”: Isn’t it time the ’Murkan
movie magnates got some new lady stars?
All the old ones—who never really showed
much acting ability—have lost their form
through years and years of the same Holly-
wood piffle. Even their physical form has
become so familiar in all its aspects that it
palls. The public that has grown up with
them and tired of them wants better value
for its money. Million-dahler sooper-stellar
“picturisations” of plays should have some
new and real actresses for their heroines to
justify their exhibition. The aged and over-
wigged crowd so long in evidence should all
be wheeled away and pensioned off.
BALLADE OF DISILLUSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Paris.—lt is said that the spring fashions will in-
clude Cossack boots and swaying skirts, supported
by a wire frame, similar to a modified crinoline, and
tight-fitting hats to be worn upon shaven heads.”
Alas for the Paris Beranger sang,
Where Murger marshalled his retinue—
Paris that echoed to clatter and clang
Of Aramis and his comrades true!
Mimi Pinson is vanished, too,
The grass its coverlet over her spreads.
Only remains this unmaidenly crew
With close-fitting hats upon shaven heads.
How sharper indeed than the serpent’s fang
This grief that rattles our wits askew.
Never again shall we savor the tang
Of the dear, dream city that Trilby knew.
Shades of Dodo, and swart Zcuzou,
Stir not a foot from Elysian meads;
There’s ’ nothing at all that appeals to you
In close-fitting hats upon shaven heads.
Yet, since it must be, let the past go hang;
Little is left for us now to rue.
The years inay allay the insistent pang,
Custom help us the bullet to chew.
Who will come to the rescue, who
Will aid us to gather life’s tangled threads?
Say what the devil’s a fellow to do
With close-fitting hats upon shaven heads!
Envoy.
Lord, when the trumpets sound the cue,
And the pale ghosts rise from their yawning beds,
Make it a rule that the flappers eschew
Those close-fitting hats upon shaven heads.
VICTORIA.

PRACTICAL
ADVANTAGES
The Ediphone Dictation Machine is connected
at your desk. From that moment you can go
through the mail; it’s as easy as telephoning.
Everything is dealt with, recorded, as it crops
up—no waste time. You think once, write once.
And all is so easily transcribed at any hour of
the day.
You are free from routine; there is more
time for constructive thought or for work out-
side the office.
Your letters and memos are spoken and are
the better for it; each carries new force and
personality.
Your best thoughts come to you in private; they
are recorded immediately, without outside aid.
Most of all, it is the convenience of the
Ediphone that appeals. Voice-writing is really
a convenience; no one who has once experienced
its helpfulness can readily forget.
TECHNICAL
ADVANTAGES

scriber.
Practical correction system based upon actual
experience of thousands of firms.
Always ready—you clear up your desk or mail
at any time you please.
Made and backed by the world’s greatest inven-
tor —the Edi phone gives you every Edison
advantage.

recorder and reproducer; correspondence
pockets; safetae cylinders—so per cent, longer
life—cannot fall apart if cracked—cylinders can-
not slip out; electrical equipment that is abso-
lutely dependable.

money—a reliable instrument that will respect
your confidence and record everything that you
wish it to —nothing else.

tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned

G.S.M.: You would be much more con-
vincing if you quoted figures to prove that large
quantities of tubercular milk are sold daily....
Marsee: The meaning is hidden too deep.' Really
there is no merit in turning poetry into a puzzle.
Kurrajong: And you call that hard times! Not
10 minutes ago The Bulletin read a letter from
a man at Birdsvillc (Far West Q.). They have
had nine inches of lain there in the last three years;
and from Jan. 1 to Nov. 18 this year only 75
points. The hero who wrote the letter added
cheerfully: “We lost most of the cattle, but were
able to save quite a lot of the goats.” What a
heart!.... A. J.P.: There is good stuff in “Cutting”;
but why introduce the religious business?....
Duppon: Buy a good literary sheepdog. Your
thoughts wander too much; and some of them never
come back.... Two E’s.: We’ve known men who
could do better than that on plain water.. . .Nitric:
You would have more success if you got out of the
bad habit of carelessly flinging your remarks on
paper. If a par isn’t conspicuously good, slovenliness
will often turn the scale against it—.H.Y.: “Cap-
tain” isn’t badly done ; but it is very long and the
local references wouldn’t be understood by the man
at Thursday Island and the woman at Cape Leeuwin
—two people The Bulletin contributor must always
keep in his eye.... Black T.: Please send name and
address to accountant Osmi: Onion juice is an
even fainter medium than the pencil you use. Why
not try that? A.J.F.: It wobbles and bumps too
much... .F.V.II.: That sort of verse may “banish”
your “sorrow and soften your grief,” but it has t-he
opposite effect with us A.A.F.: Falls too often
over its own feet M.E. (Waitara) : Doesn’t strike
us..-. .Richard C.: The verses rattle along, but they
say very little; and their manner is pretty poor
E.J.O.: Far too slight. .. .Carysfort: Must go back;
it doesn’t grip W.H.R.: The verse still fails
J.R.L.: The tribute to the memory of Kingston is
finely expressed:—
Alas, we miss this big large-hearted man
Who barely his big schemes had but began,
He was removed to a far higher sphere
Where all these earthly riddles are made clear.
Australia badly needs another statesman
To fill the gap caused by this real first ratesman.
One who will solid stand for White Australia
And count it as our National Regalia.
....Hesperian: A few of the lucid remarks of “The
Dying Swagman” are in order at the solemn close
of the year:—
It’s minutes that compute a life’s meagre span
Are measured by Heaven’s decree,
And never have dallied since time first began
Or wearied of perpetuity;
In sequence it’s tripping a life’s span away,
Compiling from youth unto age,
While the man is unnotipg, unheeding its flight,
Or its faultless pilgrimage.
... .E.O. (Penshurst) : Elsie’s mistake is one of a
regular series of the same sort, but less exciting in
the telling than most of the others... .Jocille: Pretty
enough, but entirely unconvincing... .W.E.B.: Can’t
even guess what it’s all about... .M.L.F.: Far too
slight L.A.S.: “Busted Kingdom” is a lot too
rugged... .Frances R.: The verse creaks hard; and
the same kind of thing has been done rather often.
. ...J.S.B.: Doesn’t make any sort of yarn....
L. : Rather thin.... J.C.G.: The story of
“Windy” is only a mild variation from a hundred
similar tales of timid heroes... .A. D. (Brisbane):
Doesn’t amount to anything... .Frances K.: Not for
us; but others might care for it.. . .A.A.D.: It alb
turns on the false rhymes... .J.A.H.: Very little yarn
there... .Ripponlea: There is a distinct novelty about
the delicate little tale -
“I’m cool now,”-he whisper’d, “a breeze sings
Past me. As thoqgh fanned by angel wings!”
But a rasping, gasping gargle, drawn-out, low,
hike th’ shudd’rsome croak o’ some crow,
Echoed i’ the ear of the nurse ;
And she realised then he was for th’ hearse.
Regularly his crescendo laments arose
As he writhed about i’ excruciating throes.
His organs were betwisted by that loathly paiii
Which so agitated and crazed his brain,
That shadowy outlines round his vision did stroll,
And thousands of scorpions were squirming i’ his
soul.
The nurse subside.d into a seat.
The room was filled with an unnatural heat,
“Ah! How long will this last?” the sister inquired,
Her cheeks pale ; her eyes tired.
The doctor grew grave as his glasses he adjusted,
And remarked that the patient had spontaneously-
combusted. ’;
....Roger II.: Very slight matter... .M.H.H.: The
book enthusiast whose volumes all belong to the
standard class is not very entertaining... .Michael
0.: The verse doesn't get to anything worth while
....Pauline: “Night Fear” is not verse and “De-
parture” is not thrilling.... Henry M.: Doesn’t stir
us. f. .E.A.F.: Falls far short.. . .W.R.B.: The work
is'not up to the mark....W.C.T.: It’s hard to know
what some of the lines mean and the couplet has
false rhymes M.G. (Bendigo): Saved from being
a shocking example by being commonplace....
Charles F.: Fluttered feebly, and the basket swal-
lowed it... .L.F.J.: Not up by some distance....
M. : Stick to. matters of Australian interest and
you may' have better luck.... Borage: You get
bushed too often and then wander in circles.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.D.T.: Shocking drawing and subject matter as
stale as yesterday’s beer R.N.D.G.: Make a New
Year resolution never to do it again... .B.C.M.: It
seems impossible that the person who did the decora-
tive background was responsible for the elongated
necks... .E.O.: Everything’ is so cramped that there
is danger of spontaneous combustion....B.N.L.:
Whitewash splashes on brown paper are no good.
“Sr.”: The Yankee railroad man’s vocabu-
lary is piqnantly descriptive; Here’s some of
it. The railroad engineer is known as “eagle-
eye,” “hog-head” or “throttle-puller.”; the
fireman as “diamond-pusher” and “tallow-
pot”; the brakeman as “shack,” “car-
catcher” and “fielder”; the yardmaster as
“switch-hog,” his office ras “knowledge-box,”
the yard-clerk a’s- “number-grabber” and the
railroad cleric as' “paperweight.” Locomo-
tives are “mills” or “kettles,” heavy engines
are “battleships”; the passenger-car is “var-
nished car,” “rubberneck-car” or “band-
waggon.” Switching is “shuffling them up”;
if three cars are to be cut off, you “amputate
three,” “saw three” or “s’cusc three.” To cool
a hot box is to “freeze a hub” ; to set the
brakes is to “anchor them” or “wing hoi>,”

10s. was paid for a bag of flour in the Ovens
\ alley (B. 10/11/'25), but he does not
mention the size of the bag. At the Lake
Darlot rush in ’95 in Westralia 501 b. bags of
flour brought £5 at auction; salt was 2s. per
cupful, and half mud at that.

“Beil Zine" ; How is this for land? At
Mahoenui, King Country (M.L.), a block
of 1060 acres of pasture wintered 1000 ewes,
2743 mixed sheep, 448 grown cattle and 32
horses. This works out at nearly four sheep
per acre, allowing one head of great stock
to be equal to live sheep.
* * * *
“Irel”: “Saddler Simon” (B. 10/12/’25)
is wide of the mark when he avers that there
is nothing special about pigskin. Seats
made from this leather wear smooth and do
not crack, stretch or tear. German hog-
skins are far superior to the English, and,
although a much higher figure is asked for
them by the importer, they are gradually
ousting the English pigskin from the Aus-
tralian market.
* * * *
“Adamascus”: The Queensland Govern-
ment, in accordance with its policy of im-
proving dairy-herds, is prepared to pay to
any farmer wishing to buy a pure-bred bull
a subsidy of 50 per cent. The • principal
conditions are that the subsidy shall not
exceed £5O, that the purchaser shall make
the bull available to other dairymen for a
fee of 10s., and that it must be in good
health and well-grown, registered or eligible
for registration in a herd-book, and between
the ages of one year and six years. This
scneme follows on the herd-testing scheme,
which is well supported by farmers, 22,000
cows having been tested last year.
* * * *
“Khabionba”: I must join direct issue
with “Simon the Saddler” (B. 10/12/’25)
in his disparagement of pigskin. What he
says may be more or less true of the de
generate product of these days, but I can
most emphatically assure him that me genu-
ine “best Russian liogskin” which was used
by the foremost saddlers in my young days
was far ahead of any substitute in the first
essential of a saddle-seat, the certainty that
it would hold its shape and, however often
wet, under the weight of its riders would
never either sag or shrink. I have seen
such saddle-seats after 40 and more years of
regular bush use still shaped exactly as they
were when they left their makers’ hands.
Imagine what "bag-leather” would be like
after such a test!
* t * * *
“Sixenatc” : An ambitious failure, the story
of which has just been unfolded in the
Sydney Bankruptcy Court, was the attempt
to turn Robertson, in George Euller’s elec-
torate, into a “classy” tourist resort at ex-
press speed. The optimist who hit on the
scheme had £45,000 to finance it; and having
bought all the land in sight, he formed a
company which erected an elegant pub at
a cost of v&O.OOO. Then the dream began
to fade, owing to the non-arrival of sufficient
affluent people in motor-cars. After des-
perately offering the whole outfit—pub, golf-
links and subdivided land—to a firm of land-
agents for not so many thousands the
dreamer filed his schedule. He got his cer-
tificate, there being obviously no intention
of dishonesty; and the big hotel stands
yawning over one of the most glorious views
in the "mrld as e-idence of his blasted hopes.
• * > #
“Petrie”: Now that Brisbane’s trams have
been taken over by the City Council there
will be a great increase in the number of
deadheads. The defunct Tramway Trust,
when writing its own obituary notice, took
full credit for its attitude in regard to free
passes. In Boss Badger’s time, it pointed
out, free passes were showered on officers
and “gentlemen connected with the com-
pany,” and also on their wives and daughters
and lady-friends. The Trust restricted the
jssue to employees and police officers, until
it was able to claim proudly that “free passes
were more confined in Brisbane than in any
other capital city in the Commonwealth.”
And this was probably true; it even refused
them to limbless soldiers. But that will all
i/C changed now; under municipal manage-
ment there will be passes for everybody with
a pull—beginning, of course,* with the alder-
men.
THE SEA
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a home for commerce, and strife and trade;
It lies on the sea that the good God made.
When your eyes are sore, and you long to be
Far from the' curse of a Cape Horn sea,
And the braces, stiff as a capstan bar,
Sli .c through your hands witii an icy jar,
And tie ga.by funnel with snow is choked,
And you call back sins that are long revoked.
While new sins rise like a thickening fog
And smotacr your soul till your senses clog,
Ihen you ask yourself (with some spleenrMlisplayed) :
“What is this sea that the good God madef”
Is it a home for a man to love,
Deep water beneath, grey sky above?
Who was it fashioned the sailorman—
God, or the greed of the “owning” clan ?
But it s God looks down and He hears us shout,
Whilst hauling the weather ear-ring out,
On the topsail yard, when a gale blows free,
And our clothes are wet, and the skipper he
Is putting our mothers to foulest shame,
While the mate blasphemes in the Saviour’s name !
Then it’s “Man the halyards and stretch the leech!”
(Salt horse for tea, and a biscuit each!)
And our faces welcome the icy brine
Of sprays that come, like a breath divine,
I rom the lungs of God, who is ever near,
While we fatten the funds of the profiteer.
And the skipper's soul is smudged with sin
While the slop-chest gathers its profits in.
\Ve must earn our crusts; for the time is nigh
W hen tue wind will hush and the sea go dry.
In the name of commerce and strife and trade,
II hat is this sea that the good God made?
LONGSHORE.

World’s Most Beautiful Petrol Pump
Patterned on the lines of the lonic column, the Wayne
Pump 492-F is considered by connoisseurs to be the most
attractive visible petrol pump yet designed. With its
broad base, beautiful, fluted, tapered column and large
perfectly proportioned visible petrol container this pump
attracts attention wherever seen—more especially at night
—with the large light globe on top and three bulbs under
the canopy. The whole appearance is arresting and
attracts business—petrol sales are easier.
Besides being particularly attractive these pumps are
exceptionally easy to operate —just an easy backward and
forward movement of the handle which gives an ever
flow of petrol into the visible container.
And, as for rapidity of operation. The discharge is by
gravity—it only takes 20 seconds to lift and discharge five
(5) gallons of petrol.
Attractive in appearance, durable in construction, efficient
in operation and accurate in measurement, Wayne pumps
all the world over are recognised as the best that money
can buy.
Passed and approved by the Department
of Weights and Measures of
New South Wales and all other States.

The Most Efficient Mower on Earth.
THE
«
ALL-BRITISH PETROL MOTOR-MOWER.
The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the necessity
of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, etc.
It is fitted with a 2|-li.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one attendant
for guiding pnrposes.
The running cost of an “ATCO,” thanks to the scientific precision of its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely
cut 1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol
and oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
Sold in two sizes—l6-inch cutters, £7l; 22-inch cutters, £lO5 complete.
Printed matter supplied with pleasure on application.

“Mako” : Maoi’iland has a Newcastle too ;
or, rather, it would have one were it not
that the Waikato town presented with that
name has never used it, but has stuck to the
old Maori Ngaruawaliia (“The meeting of two
waters”). As the town stands at a river-
junction, the original name, even if over-
burdened with vowels, is singularly appro-
priate.
“H.K.”: Touching church bells, another
Australian peal of note is hung in St. Pat-
rick's, Melbourne. These bells were founded
in 1852 by one Murphy, of “the Liberty,”
Dublin. On each appears in raised letters:
“St. Patrick’s, Melbourne. South Australia/’
The peal arrived in 1853 and lay in the
porch of St. Francis’. Melbourne, until hung
in St. Patrick’s in 1868.
“Stellsby”: On the British windjammer
William Mitchell, a recent arrival in Mel-
bourne from the Canadian Atlantic coast,
the captain, two mates and five apprentices
are British, and the 26 ratings all Scandina-
vian. Somewhat on a par with the Aus-
tralian Seamen’s Union, which carries enough
dinkum Australians on its books to man a
rowing-boat.
“Percy Pintpot”: Sydney City Council has
become a publican on a large scale, a
fact that may presently induce its pampered
employees to demand free beer at all muni-
cipal taverns. The council already owns 18
hotels, and wants to stick to them : when the
Coronation vanishes from the Park-street
corner, in the course of resumptions, it in-
tends to retain the license and plaster it on
to new premises in the centre of the new
“broadway.”
“Clerk”: We’ve been spared one bit of
threatened plagiarism—Bondi is not to be
the name of the new railway station between
Chelsea and Carrum (Vic.), after all. On
a plebiscite the ratepayers plumped for
Heathdale; but that was rejected by the
railway people because of its similarity to
Heath Vale. As a compromise they'll call
the place Bonlieath, Heath being the name
of a well-known property owner in the dis-
trict.
“FY7”: The Queensland railway service
continues to pile up records, especially for
pilfering in transit. Not long ago an Isisford
man had consigned to him a motor-lorry and,
a Aveek later, a car. Both travelled by rail
from Brisbane; but while the lorry arrived
minus all the tools and the starting-handle,
the car got through with the loss of only
half the tools and a spotlight. The same
week a Rockhampton firm opened a big case
of assorted tools from Brisbane and found
it contained bricks.
Of the Atherton family that came over-
land from the Armidale district (N.S.W.) to
Queensland in 1860, bringing a mob of cattle
and station requirements and opening up
thousands of acres of new country, only one
original member survives. He is Richard
Atherton, now living in Brisbane. His
father, Edmund Atherton, took up Mt. Iled-
low, and the family still owns it. Mrs. A.
J. Ilaylock, the eldest daughter of Edmund,
has just died at Rockhampton at 80, 23
years after her husband, another scion of
pioneers. The shock of figuring in two recent
railway accidents cut her life short.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Surely Aus-
tralia knows no more remarkable family
than that of my old military chief, Captain
Bull, of the 99th Regiment, commanding on
the Blue Mountains 1842-48, and subse-
quently Gold Commissioner in Victoria. He
died at Goulburn (N.S.W.) in 1900, aged
95, leaving a widow aged 92; and of their
children there are still living three daugh-
ters, aged respectively 90, 8S and 76, and
three sons, 80, 78 and 74. Mrs. Raymond,
of Goulburn, is the eldest; W. McLeod Bull,
of Bendigo, the baby, lie and two others
were born while their father was building
the road over the Blue Mountains.
“Alwyn”: Just on 20 years ago an old
lady residing in a western suburb sold her
cottage to a shrewd Sydney business man
for an annuity payable at the rats of fl
per week and the, right to live in the dwell-
ing rent-free. She was then 70 years old,
and the bargain seemed a good thing for the
buyer, more particularly as an eminent Mac-
quarie-street specialist had pronoungejl the
elderly matron to be suffering from a'serious
affection of the heart — angina pectoris. She
is now almost 90, and still seemingly good
for a few years. The house has already
cost the buyer over £lOOO plus interest oil
his payments.
“Simon”: The most uncheckable Parlia-
mentary candidate ever I knew was William
Logan, who ran for Mudgee (N.S.W.) in
the middle ’nineties. He was a good, gram-
matical talker, too, of presentable appear-
ance ; but there was a vacuum somewhere.
He spoke everywhere—from the top of hay-
stacks in the country to Salv’army rings in
the town. He waged his talking campaign
all day long, and hours after the poll closed
he was still at it. He got two votes, but
was too much of a gentleman to leave the
place without calling a “return thanks” meet-
ing for the following Saturday.
“Woorook”: Bowden, returned once more
for Parramatta, is responsible for what
appears to me as one of the minor tragedies
of the Federal elections. His two young
daughters had lately been reading “Pilgrim’s
Progress,” and were fascinated by Faith-
ful and Christian. They are also readers
of the N.S.W. Prohibition journal, Gkit.
The repercussion of these studies caught
the two household cats, which have been
named Christian Grit and Faithful Pro-
hibition. Whether or not the S.P.C.A.
should intervene is beside the question. The
real tragedy is that a man possessing ani-
mals so named should represent the elec-
torate in which I live.
Australia’s new Federal representatives
confess to a variegated lot of occupations.
Only one describes himself as a gentleman—
8. M. Bruce. There are no fewer than 17
farmers of sorts and four graziers, 12 law-
yers, four journalists and as many doctors or
surgeons. Six call themselves members of
Parliament, and one candidate who so de-
scribed himself, Joel Moses Gabb, is now
without a job. Agents, storekeepers, clerks,
secretaries, merchants and electrical en-
gineers number two each. There is a tailor,
a grocer, a shearer, a traveller, a plumber,
a miner, an artist, a plasterer, a draper, an
auctioneer, an aocountafit. a patternmaker,
a chemist, a lock-manufacturer and an “edu-
cationalist.”

Why the Studebaker Big Six Outsells
all other High Powered Cars
m
PROFIT production in big modern
plants enables Studebaker to sell the
Big Six—a sturdy quality car, famous for
power, endurance and long life —at a price
far below other high-powered cars. As a
result, the Big Six, not only in the United
States, but throughout the world, outsells
every other car of equal or greater rated
horsepower.
To the powerful engine and sturdy chas-
sis, Studebaker has added a body so staunch-
ly built, so finely finished, that no car at any
price excels it
High quality at a low price is possible
because Studebaker alone, in the fine car
field, makes all its own engines, bodies,
clutches, springs, axles, gear boxes, differen-
tials, steering gears, gray iron castings and
drop forgings. Studebaker saves the extra
profits and overhead which others must pay
to outside parts and body makers. Savings
thus effected returned to the purchaser in a
lower price.

Girls! Imagine Your Complexion
Clear, Rosy and Velvety.
When your complexion worries you, and you feel that your skin is unattractive,
instead of fresh and smooth, look to the soap you are using. Many soaps are
more harmful to the skin than actual neglect, for they contain alkali, which
makes the skin harsh and dry.
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is a specially prepared skin soap, free from alkali,
and contains just the right amount of the gentle healing medication of Rexona!
the Rapid Healing Ointment, which is so widely used in the
treatment of skin and scalp troubles.
Rexona Soap relieves the clogged pores and tendency
to redness, cleans away the blotches and oiliness,
and brings backs that natural beauty to the
skin which is the heritage of every girl.
Rexona Soap makes the best shampoo for
the hair. It cleanses the scalp from
dandruff, and leaves the hair rich
and glossy.

FOR THE SICK ROOM,
if you own an “ISKO.”
“ISKO” means all the
difference between the
pleasant choice of foods
and the boredom of a re-
stricted summer diet; be-
tween health and ailing;
between vigorous strength
and the sloth that comes
from wrong feeding.
If you can afford an
“ISKO” you can’t afford
to be without it. If you
are indifferent about your-
self think of your family.
They’re worth it!
“ISKO,” the Automatic Electric Refrigerator,
ISKO, which may be attached to any ice-chest,
connects with the house electric service and uses very little
current. It may be supplied either air or water cooled—we
strongly recommend the latter as being much more efficient.
ISKO is safe, silent and foolproof—uses no ammonia
nor other dangerous substance—it is extremely simple, having
only two moving parts.
ISKO is manufactured in various sizes for household,
hospital, confectioners’, hotel, club or butchers’ use.

The Unattainable.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rINHERE is a mystic way wliereon
I ' One gazing down the past may see
JL A marching host of shadows wan
That ever journey restlessly.
No word they say, no laughter make,
No dust ai’ises where they tread;
No bread they crave, no thirst they slake,
As pauselessly they fare ahead.
With haunted eyes that gaze afar,
They move, a gaunt and pallid file;
Maybe it is some distant star
That lures them on from mile to mile.
As steadfast, staring, stern they go
By homes where blest home-lovers dwell,
Out-reaching are their arms, as though
To grasp the unattainable.
From first-drawn breath to last-drawn breath
They never knew the bliss of rest;
As once in life, so now in death
With weary feet they quest and quest.
Forsakers of the paths of ease,
By loving hearts and hands unstayed,
Through realms far wider than the seas
And continents of earth they strayed.
Beyond the borders that surround
Our little world of space and time
They fared, and faring onward found
Abysses deep and heights sublime.
As on they forged with faces set,
What time strange winds about them blew,
High peaks unscalable they met,
And deeps unplumbable they knew.
But still at moments when, unspurred,
Unurged, undriven, they reclined
In alien solitudes, they heard
Sweet voices calling down the wind;
Low voices, voices of the hearth,
Heart voices, and the tumult gay
Of children making glad the earth
For earthlier, happier folk than they.
Yet. callous, cold and strong of will,
They journeyed on with arms out-thrust,
And eyes that gazed afar, until
Death mixed them with their mother-dust.
Still, still, pale shadows, night and day,
Beneath a death-defying spell,
Lone wandering, they seek for aye
The starry Unattainable.

The Ball
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
4 DIIIAN WEST stood outside the little
stationer’s shop and looked at the
ball in the window. It was an
india-rubber ball, not too big. and bright
with colors that should satisfy the most
passionate of childish tastes. One half
was green, the other red; and there were
golden circles and a little picture on either
side. In short, Adrian decided, just the sort
of ball that would set young Stranger chuck-
ling with delight. He had never had a toy
before, but he was getting older now, and
needed more to keep him amused. Adrian
jingled a couple of coins reflectively in his
pocket. One, he knew, was a sixpenny-piece ;
the edge of the other was smooth, and it
was pitifully small. He had counted on
sausages for tea that night and for break-
fast in the morning, and threepence would
not be sufficient. But then there were sav-
eloys, not so tasty, perhaps, but very filling,
and only a penny each. And it was pay-day
to-morrow. So Adrian marched into the
shop and came out sixpence poorer but with
a ball bulging one coat-pocket.
There was a keen wind rustling up the
street, and Adrian drew his coat a little
more closely around him. But he was smil-
ing as he trudged briskly homewards. It
was strange to think that he was so interested
in a 12-inonths-old baby. He had never been
married, had never known love in all his
five and thirty years, and had never felt
the paternal instinct. He had come home
from the sea, after many years of wandering,
and had sought out his sister at her city
address. It was years since he had seen
Viola, and she had married during his ab-
sence —had married well, according to the
tone of the one letter she had written him.
Just how well she had married he had not
known until he came to the big grey house,
not too far from the city, and not too near.
Faded stone spoke of substance and assured
standing, and inside was massive furniture,
an air of cloistered calm, and soft-footed
servants who moved through the house like
pale wraiths. There was a hint of formality
here, even to the little nursery upstairs,
where a spoilt child bullied its nurse and
its mother too, on those rare occasions
when Viola remembered its existence.
For Viola had married too well. She had
risen from lowly places to the home of a
big city business man, carried there by a
coldly beautiful face and the instinctive
manner of a princess. Adrian had looked at
her in astonishment when he saw her first,
so utterly at home was she in these sur-
roundings that oppressed him. And then
there had been her greeting, quite lifeless,
from the limp passivity of her hand to the
feeble kiss she planted on his sun-tanned
cheek. She had told a servant to show him to
a room and hinted about dressing for dinner.
“But what about the young ’un, Vi?”
asked Adrian. “I must see my nephew, you
know.”
“Really?” said Viola. “I didn’t think
you would be interested. Manners—show Mr.
West the nursery on your way to his room.”
On the day that this happened it was
fairly late when he returned to his sister’s
home, and the front verandah was heavy
with shadows. It was the thin little voice
that first attracted his attention, and then
he saw vaguely a dim shape on the verandah.
He picked it up gently—a baby only a few
months old —and soothed it with clumsy
words. He was about to take the helpless
bundle inside to his sister, but after a
momentary hesitation he walked back to the
nearest street-lamp. As he had expected,
there was a note pinned to the baby’s clothes,
and he picked out the words clearly enough:
‘haby is bottle-fed. Be good to him.”
1 hat was all. For a long moment Adrian
stood in the shadows, the baby pressed close
to him. Strange thoughts were stirring him
to depths hitherto unplumbed. It was such
a helpless little devil, and such a feather-
weight in his arms. Babies cried, of course,
and needed more attention than an ignorant
man could give. And yet—“Be good to
him.” He looked back to the big house in
its solemn shadows and shivered to think
how good the cold woman who controlled
the place would be likely to be to this wee
waif when her own child was thrust away
out of sight and out of hearing. “Be good
to him.” It seemed that this appeal was
addressed directly to him, that he had been
sent there just in time to prevent other
hands seizing the child and sending it to
the nearest institution. That decided him,
and he walked firmly down the street with
the bundle in his arms.
He still hated to think, even at this dis-
tant date, of the terrors of that first night
with the baby. lie had rented a furnished
room in a cheap suburb, and it had taken
the combined skill of the landlady and a
female lodger to keep the child reasonably
quiet. There had been much anxious dis-
cussion, a great deal of helpless advice, and
very little action. Morning had found Adrian
quite ready to take the landlady’s advice and
leave the baby at the nearest public nursery
while he went to work. He picked him up at
night on the way home, and received a lot
of advice from the nurse in charge. Things
went better after that, and the youngster
thrived amazingly as the months went by.
He fought his way, too, very far into
Adrian’s heart, and there were great doings
at night after he had brought him home, in
the brief hour before he settled down to sleep.
This night, however, exceeded all others.
“Stranger”—-he had always called him that
—had never seen anything quite as wonder-
ful as that ball. It eluded the grasp of
his tiny fingers at first, but afterwards the
chubby hand grasped it more firmly, and
there was a great chase around the room
as he dropped it, and crawled after the
shining shape as swiftly as he could shuffle.
Round and round he went, in breathless
circles, capturing the colorful sphere for
brief moments, and then chasing it again as
it slipped from his grasp and rolled across
the floor. Adrian watched him for a long
time, chuckling and talking to him, and
then left him alone while he made for the
bathroom. At the moment of leaving his
room he saw a girl. She was leaning against
the doorway of the room opposite his, across
the landing, and, as he looked curiously at
the slim figure in the shabby costume, she
swayed suddenly. lie caught her.
“Steady,” he said, cheerfully; “you’re
just a little weak.”
He helped her into her room, leaving the
door open behind him, and let her sink into
a chair by the rickety old table.
“I’ll be all right in a moment,” she said.
“I haven’t long been out of hospital.”
He brought her a glass of water, and sat
beside . her, looking at the regular features,
the dark hair and the expressive eyes. A
sensitive face, lie decided. Presently, how-
ever, she seemed to recover, and he rose to
his feet.
“I'll leave you now,” he said, if you’re
quite all right. I have a baby to look after,
and goodness knows what mischief he will
be into if I am away too long.”
“A baby?” She looked up quickly, and he
could see an eager light in her eyes. “Have
you a baby?”
“Yes,” lie said, feeling vaguely uncom-
fortable.
"So had I,” she said very thoughtfullv.
“Once.”
Her eyes were exploring the past, and he
moved restlessly, and would have left the
room had she not looked up suddenly and
spoken to him in a r 7 oiee almost harsh.
“Do you know,” she said, “I once had
a baby, and I gave it away!” She laughed,
with a trace of hysteria in her voice. "Can
you imagine any woman doing‘that?”
“I cannot,” he said, looking at her gravely.
“Well, I did,” she went on, a little Wildly.
“I did it because I thought it' was for the
best. We were very poor. My husband was
out of work, and he wanted to send the
child to an institution, lie said we would
starve if lie didn't get a job soon, and, though
I was going out to work every day, we could
only just keep going. I was afraid he would
carry out his thi’eat while I was away dur-
ing the day—he was that sort of man. I
had had girlish dreams. I had dreamed of
rich people and the sheltered lives they led.
And I had prayed that some day I ‘could
give my baby all this. So when my husband
made these threats I slipped out late one
afternoon and left the mite on a rich man’s
doorstep. The people there would be good
to it, I knew. Nobody could help being
good to my baby, for it' was a lovely child.
It hurt—yes, it hurt!—but it was for the
best, and I felt that it was a sacrifice
worth making. No matter what happens to
me, my child will have a chance.”
. “And your husband?” asked Adrian, his
voice sounding as though he choked over
the words.
“Is dead. An accident, when at last he
did get work.”
_ “And you really think that strangers could
give your baby the same care that you
would ?”
She looked up swiftly, with a frightened
gleam in her eyes.
“Don’t talk like that,” she whispered.
“These thoughts have worried me dreadfully
There is always the chance that they are
not good to it. But they must be —they
must be!”
“Not necessarily,” said Adrian, almost
brutally. “Is is usual in cases like this for
people to send the child to the nearest
institution.”
Deliberately he was trying to hurt her, to
hurt her that he might not feel the pain so
much about his own heart. Strangely,
through the last few months, he had been
praying that he would never meet the baby’s
mother. But the horror in the gasp that
came from her now made him weaken.
“Don't torture me.” she cried. “You will
drive me mad. God knows I have suffered
enough. I have prayed for it, and longed
for it, and my arms have ached for the wee
body pressing against mine. It is too late
now, and I can only hope and fear.”
“Yes,” said Adrian very slowly, “it is
too late.”
He walked from the room abruptly, with-
out word or sign of farewell, and left the
door open behind him. Then he went on into
his own room, and so stood looking down

His Masters vbice
at Stranger as he chased the ball and
chuckled in his glee, Adrian had never felt
quite as he did in that moment. His heart,
it seemed, was an emotional battleground,
where old convictions and dreams were being
ruthlessly torn apart, and the shreds of a
brief happiness were chafing him unmerci-
fully. He was tempted, too —tempted to
take the baby and leave the house for ever,
to seek a distant part of the city, where
there was no chance of the little one, who
had come to mean so much to him, being
taken away.
Then he smiled suddenly, and bending
down, caught Stranger to him and smothered
the little face with tender kisses. After
that, very tranquil of face, he stood up,
and took the ball from the baby. There
was a cry of protest, but he did not heed
it. and walked to the door. With this
open there was a view through the doorway
across the landing into the other room,
where the girl was crouching over the table
with her head in her hands. Very deliber-
ately Adrian sent the ball rolling gently
across the landing and in through the open
doorway.
Stranger had watched him with open
mouth and eager eyes, and now he went
scudding across the floor, crawling with all
the strength of his little limbs after the
enticing sphere. Adrian walked back into
his own room, and stood by the open win-
dow-—and waited.
A man can think of many things in a
few long moments, especially when they
mean the end of a dream, and it seemed
a very long time before there was a step
on the threshold of his room. He turned
to face the girl, who had come across with
Stranger in her arms. The tears had van-
ished from her face, and there was a new
light in her eyes that set Adrian’s pulse
moving more quickly.
“Here is your baby.’* she said, holding
the little chap closer to her.
“My baby?” repeated Adrian blankly
“But isn't he yours?”
“Mine?” The old pain had crept back into
her voice. “I wish he was. No—my baby
was a little girl.”
Adrian took the child from her. his mind
confused beneath conflicting emotions. Very
faintly he could hear her speaking.
“The landlady told me all about the little
chap to-day. I hope you will let me look
after him while you are at work!”
He did not know if he answered her. He
was thinking, in a detached manner, that
this woman was very beautiful.
M. H. HOLCROFT.
A Greek Abduction.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE were sitting on Lady Isabel’s
home at the bottom of the stairs
when the young man slid down the
banisters and dropped at onr feet.
I had the drawing-room rug in my suit-ease,
and our comedian was holding all that was
left of the bedroom in his arms. It was a
pillow without a case. lie was throwing it
into the air and catching it. This was our
introduction to Tony, the young man who
had slid down the banisters.
“Rooms?” he inquired. “Come right up.
This your luggage?”
lie took the pillow from the comedian, who
then picked up a carpet-bag which was full
of alarm-clocks.
The alarm-clocks had nothing to do with
Lady Isabel’s home, all of which we had lost
except the rug, the pillow, a sheet and a
blanket. Everything had been carried on in
the goods-train out of which we had just been
dropped. The young man was in his pyjamas,
and over them he wore an overcoat.
We had previously ransacked Isabel’s
home for anything in the way of rugs and
pillows, as we had a long, cold wait at the
railway-siding for the goods-train that had
moved us on from Hell-or-Notliing to Devil’s
Flat, a large western-Queensland town filled
with wool, camel-teams, hotels and men. We
expected to do good business there with
“East Lynne.”
I was Lady Isabel, the heroine, yawning
in the rosy light of dawn ; at my feet the
hamper we used for the cradle of the baby
Lady Isabel should not have had.
We followed the boy upstairs. He was
very boyish for that hour. He had but re-
cently arrived from Athens, wher? he had
been a University student. His elder
brother, finding oysters in Australia more
profitable than Sophocles in Greece, had
cabled the boy to come away from his books
to the oysters. He was eighteen, and had
arrived in Australia in time to be present
at his brother’s marriage, which had since
resulted in a nephew for him. We heard
about the nephew quite accidentally as he
unlocked rooms for us. The rest of the in-
formation came from one of the travellers
who had dropped off the train with us. He
had also suggested the Greek’s hotel to us.
Tony did not exactly introduce the nephew
to us. He said to me: “We are full up.”
“Races?” asked our tired comedienne, who
was a journalist touring for experience.
“No,”, he replied breathlessly. “The
christening.” He took the hamper and threw
it into the room.
“Who’s getting christened?” I asked.
“May I have your photograph?” he re-
plied, with a strange little shiver. “I’m
mad on actresses.”
“Another conquest,” yawned our adven-
turess. “I can’t understand how you
bother.”
Tony’s job was showing people to their
rooms, minding a picture-show and opening
oysters. Collecting actresses’ photographs
Was his hobby.
When we went down to breakfast we saw
the priest who was to christen the baby
sitting at table, and wdien we walked out
after him and his cap Tony shivered again
and said to me: “Don’t forget your pic-
ture! I am not allowed to have a girl till
I’m twenty-one, but I like you.”
Nothing so beautiful had come my way
since the time Cornstalk Dad had bounded
into my dressing-room at Tired Hollow, and,
slapping me on the naked back as I was
changing from stage to street dress, said:
“You’ll do !” That was the only criticism
of my acting I ever cherished.
‘'Why aren't you allowed to have a girl 7”
I asked, as Tony walked upstairs beside me.
George bobbed up like a black cork from
nowhere. “No Greek marry till twenty-one
—not even kiss a girl. Look out! My
brother George!”
He was gone, and George, spying about,
gave me a nice smile.
We called Tony the Virgin Youth after
that. Hut we were not a happy company.
It was. raining; it had been raining for days.
Our scenery had all gone on; there was a
local picture-show, and we expected poor
business.
We got it. Bill, our manager, called us
together. He smoked a Capstan instead
of a cigar. Ilis red hair was untidy, and
his face looked like rent owing.
We all crowded into his room, and he
whispered to us hoarsely: “I can’t pay you.
I haven’t a penny. I can’t even pay your
board, and I know none of you has any
money. What suggestions are there for-
skipping the town? This Greek’ll hold otir
luggage till we pay. A company without
scenery is bad enough, but what’s a com-
pany without wardrobe to do 7”
We were silent. Then our comedian con-
fessed that he had sold two alarm-clocks.
\\ e all jumped. "I always carry a line in
case of emergency,” he said. Our adventuress
said she had brought some corsets to sell;
but these were not regarded seriously.
“1 know what I’ll do,” I said, leaning over
to Bill. “I’ll kidnap Tony and won’t give
him up till George lets you all out.”
This was regarded as inspirational. It
was decided that I should abduct the young
Greek the following evening about 9 o’clock.
There was an oyster supper that night and
George and Tony would both be present.
The fish and oyster train came in about
8 o’clock and Tony would be slaughtering
oysters until 9. I would decoy the beauti-
ful black-looking dove into a dark corner,
whisper and suggest flight—a walk in the
bush. I knew that I was Tony’s first love
by this, for he had asked several times for
a lock of my hair. As most of my hair is
false our adventuress and comedienne had
been examining my wig carefully for a suit-
able lock for him.
We slept little that night. In the morn-
ing Bill announced that he thought of stay-
ing on to play the town again.
George was very nice about it. He was
sitting at the desk' arranging for the priest’s
journey home when Bill spoke. “Yes,” he
said, “I’m sorry you had a bad house. Use
my picture theatre, if you like. It is bigger
than the theatre.”
This offer sounded too good to be real, aud
Bill took it as a sign that George had us
well under his hard, black eyes.
Tony Avas in charge of all luggage. I said
to him after luncheon, “I have that lock
of hair for you.”
I went to my room with Flora and Laura,
our adventuress and comedienne, and taking
off my wig we looked it over for a lock.
“It seems a real shame to disturb it,”
Flora said. Then we heard a discreet rap
at the door. Laura opened it while I put
my wig on again. It was Tony.
“'Yes,” I said.
“To-night when they are at sapper.” lie
whispered darkly, “I am going to take my
brother’s car and we shall go for a drive.”
Then he was gone.
“Olympus!” I gasped. “Tony is going to
abduct me!” All be ready to abscond. I
shall detain him in the depths of the bush
while you go to the station. Take my things
with you and I’ll come along later.”
Everything sounded very well until Tony
abducted..me and we hit the first blue-gum.
I have a patched-up heart as well as a wig.
“Steady,” I said with a groan, and stole
a glance at Tony. Zeus’s eyelashes! Leander,
before lie took that classic plunge for Hera,
did not look out on the Hellespont with a
wilder look than this lost Greek of mine
looked out on the Australian bush. He was
straining and tugging, turning and twisting
and starting and staring, and every time we
did not 'bump a blue-gum we bumped into a
rut out of which we leapt with a groan.
I know nothing about driving a car, but
I had until then some vague notion that it
should now 7 and again run smoothly.
Bang! We w T ere tied up in a tree this
time. The engine barked and snorted at
once, hissed and sizzled, and Tony said, “I
think w 7 e’ve come the wrong road.”
“Hadn’t we better turn back?” I sug-
gested.
“No. I make myself sick of George. He
won’t let me drive a car or kiss a girl. I
damn him and do both at once.”
And me with nothing but my w T ig to
strangle him with! “Do you like Australia,
Tony?” I asked.
“Yes. I like you much. I have only
liked one actress better. She is dead now.”
Perhaps he killed her driving her in a
car!
We now hit a tree with such violence that
the front of the car was dented. We backed
and nearly w T ent through a gate.
“Oh, damn!” he said. “We are on the
wrong road. I’ll turn her.”
I had not time to ask if I might get out
while this happened before the ear began
to spin. Then it suddenly shot forward.
Bang.! _
“This must be the woi f st road on earth,”
I said.
Then the car rose, took the road with her,
and we were both underneath.
I don’t know who found us or my wig—
that w 7 as picked up on the road.
And, after all, the abduction was quite
wasted. Even while I had been risking my
life for my profession, George had caught
Bill, told him any time would do for the
board, and said he would help to get a good
house as he w r as a newcomer at the Flat
and wanted to make himself popular.
We had a fine house, with his assistance,
and then I told him I was sorry I had given
him anxiety over his youngster brother.
“Oh, that boy!” he said scornfully. “I
don’t mind how he flirt nor what he kees.
But you were lucky. He never drove a car
in his life before.”
