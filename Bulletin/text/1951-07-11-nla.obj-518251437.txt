Modern Drama Stems
From the Miracle Plays of
Chester’s Early Monks
/'-'HESTER has for many centuries been
an important ecclesiastical as well as
commercial and military centre, and in
former years the various religious bodies
owned much of the town. Before the
dissolution of the monasteries by Henry
VIII (1509-1547), Chester Cathedral was
the Benedictine Abbey of St. Werburgh.
It was designed as an abbey church and
in the buildings grouped around its
cloisters the visitor of today has an
unrivalled opportunity to study the way
of life and surroundings of the monks.
The site of the cathedral, according to
tradition, was occupied in Roman times
by a church dedicated to Si. Peter and St.
Paul. History records that the relics of
St. Werburgh, who died about 7()0, were
brought here in 875 from Hanbury in
Staffordshire by Elfreda, the daughter of
King Alfred, to preserve them from the
Danish invaders. The earliest documents
referring to the church are dated 958,
and in 1093 the Norman Ball of Chester,
Hugh Lupus, with the'aid of St. Anselm,
Archbishop of Canterbury, founded the
first Benedictine monastery. x During the
succeeding five centuries the monastery
became a wealthy and powerful estab-
lishment, owning many manors, mills,
salt-workings and fishing and hunting
rights along the Dee.
The monks wrote Miracle Plays
illustrating Biblical episodes, which were
produced by the city guilds, each of
which was anxious to outdo its rivals
in the magnificence of its production.
Modern drama had its origin in these
early pageants which played an important
part in medieval life and education, and
which continued to be performed until
the seventeenth century.
At the Reformation in 1541 Henry
VIII converted the abbey church into the
cathedral of the new diocese of Chester,
and the dedication was changed for the
last time to Christ and the Blessed
Virgin.

JEKYLL—PLUS HYDE.
Robert Louis Stevenson has been dead
nearly 60 years, and nobody, except
perhaps Dickens, has had his reputation
so closely guarded by his representatives.
His wife, who died in 1914, his official
biographer (Balfour), Colvin, his
friends in the family circle and his ad-
mirers, have all conspired to present a
picture of hiip as false and inappropriate
to the man and his contribution to
English literature as possible.
The conventional view of Stevenson,
one supported by his own peculiar type
of writing and his choice of subjects, has
been of a gay, boyish, fastidious fellow,
living a model if slightly unconventional
and playfully Bohemian life; a
character utterly chivalrous and
romantic, and appropriately condemned
to an early grave by the fashionable
literary malady of the Victorian and
Regency ages—consumption, from which
young heroines of fiction once perished
in heaps.
At last, however, Mr. Malcolm Elwin
in The Strange Case of Robert Louis
Stevenson (Macdonald) has penetrated
the veil of humbug, explored the facts and
brought them to light, exhibiting them
with a due sense of responsibility and
with delicacy, and taking very good care
to quote his authorities.
From his examination emerges a bio-
graphy of Stevenson —the first real one,
since previous ones, in The light of this
new research, seem to consist almost
entirely of half-truths. About the only
thing that now remains intact of the
Stevenson of literary legend is his family
of respectable. God-fearing Scottish
engineers, builders of lighthouses and
pillars of the kirk and of the sober society
of Edinburgh.
Even this family assumes new colors
under Mr. Elwin’s microscope. The
generally accepted picture of his father
has always been of a somewhat stiff parent,
ungifted with the capacity to recognise
genius and steadily bent throughout his
son’s life on crushing his tendency to
romanticism and originality with a view
to depriving a waiting world of a spate of
literary masterpieces.
The truth seems to be that he was a
grim and upright Scot faced with
phenomena which would give any man,
much less an elder of the kirk, cause for
anxiety and even anguish, but who was
prepared to be understanding and con-
ciliatory and generous when he felt that
the situation of his son justified a
change of attitude.
In a family whose offspring would
naturally go to the High School and Uni-
versity and fall into a prosperous pro-
fession young R.L.S. must have seemed
to his relations a startling manifestation
of the vagaries of human genes. From
his. earliest days he grew like a weed. He
showed little interest in anything but the
mechanics of writing, studied against a
subjective background which would not
have been regarded as encouraging even
by his greatest admirers of a later day.
His earliest text-book exemplars in the
literary art were penny-dreadfuls and the
“Boys’ Own Paper” style of adventure
stories. In his boyhood he tried his hand
at bungling adaptations of Mayne Read,
an author now almost completely for-
gotten save by a few very old gentlemen
who still remember their callow school-
days. He became a poor imitator of
Scott, about the hardest author in the
world to imitate without caricature. But
he accepted his fate as a future engineer
and matriculated to the engineering class
of Edinburgh University more in a spirit
of resignation than of earnestness, as
subsequent events showed.
From the first he completely neglected
his studies. He made an impression on
very few of his professors and tutors.
Those who did give him attention found
him noted for nothing except his idleness
and truancies. His fellow-students dis-
liked him. One described him later as
“a slithering, loose flail of a fellow, all
joints, elbows and exposed spindleshanks,
Jus trousers generally a foot short in the
1eg.... 50 like a scarecrow that one
almost expected him to creak in the
wind.” He adopted “an offensive, pro-
vocative attitude of sneering” towards
University, voting its teaching “an
elaborate, stupid joke, fit only for asses.”
He put on airs which were voted even
more ridiculous than his velvet jacket and
was so consumed with his own conceit
(as another contemporary had it) that he
could not even walk properly but must
for ever go mincing and posing like a
dancing-master. ; , .a bundle of affecta-
tions. ~ .suggesting a touch of insanity.”
To the companionship of people of his
own class he preferred that of “seamen,
chimney-sweeps and thieves.” He fre-
quented the lowest slums of Edinburgh
and its adjacent seaport, and they were
very low indeed. And he eventually
came to his father with the engaging
proposition that he should be allowed to
marry a young woman practising the
oldest profession in the world among the
dregs of Auld Reekie —a lady who must
have been rather special in her line, since
it appears that she was “slim, dark, very
trim and neat, with jet black hair and
a complexion that heeded no cosmetics
to make it rosy and alluring.”
Of course, as Mr. Elwin points out,
young Mr. Stevenson’s urge to matri-
mony with this female paragon was not
altogether original; for Hazlitt harnessed
himself to a damsel more experienced if
less alluring and Propertius had his
“golden Cynthia.” But Mr. Stevenson,
senior, not to mention Mrs. Stevenson,
probably had never heard of Propertius
and would not have approved of him in
any case. They were very glad to prise
the candidate for matrimony off his
ambition at the expense of the sacrifice
of their own plan that he should follow
the family engineering bent.
As a result he was allowed to study
for the Bar—and actually qualified and
made one pathetic attempt to practise.
But his life for years afterwards was
something of a hell, according to his own
conceptions of the Inferno, because of
the stern but well-meaning attempts of his
male parent to win him from a professed
atheism and the arms of numerous ladies
who crossed his path.
The story of these later lights-o’-love
will greatly please Mr. Jack Lindsay and
all other literary addicts to the elucida-
tion of historic-mother complexes. The
ladies were all years older than the young
romantic, and they were all, to some
degree, attached to males initially likely
to resent the intrusion into their
domestic orbits of an amorous human
scarecrow whose infection with tuber-
culosis was as evident as his affinity for
red wine.
The first of the ladies was a Mrs.
Stilwell, whose assets included a husband
whose heart was not even rolled gold,
four children, 34 years’ experience of the
wicked world and Sidney Colvin, whom
she eventually married —though Heaven
alone knows why she bothered, since her
relationship with him had become so
sanctified by time that even Queen Vic-
toria could have accepted it as readily
as she did that of the Duke of Cambridge
and his inamorata.
Stevenson was 22 when he met the
lady, and Mr. Elwin fears that she “en-
couraged him to a dangerous degree of
intimacy,” This might have become even
more dangerous if Mr. Colvin (later Sir
Sidney) had not been very much on the
scene and if, in course of his literary and
other expeditions on the Continent, the
young man had not found other game,
notably a semi-Oriental charmer, Madame
Garschine, who sounds very much like
Mrs. Stilwell translated into Russian.
She also was years older than the invalid
Peter Pan who worshipped her.
The Stilwell connection in the end mel-
lowed into a relationship in which the
fervid youth consented to call her
“mother” and continued to do so
throughout his life in a revealing cor-
respondence. And the Muscovite soon
gave way to Fanny Osborne, only 11
years older than himself, whose nature
and surroundings placed any rival who
might come along under an insuperable
handicap.
She was an American lady of Indian
ancestry. She had a husband who sounds
as if he had been invented by Bret Harte.
She had a lovely adolescent daughter;
also a son in his schoolboy years (Lloyd
Osborne) —always an advantage to any
female who desired the love of R.L.S.
This lad was Fanny’s offspring by a kind
friend who afterwards became a
successful banker and was pleased to
accept her account.
She was, moreover, as a contemporary
historian described her, of a “character
that somehow suggested Napoleon, by
the firm setting of the jaw and the
beautifully precise and delicate model-
ling of the nose and lips.” She was an
“artist,” the creator of those delightful
temperance pictures, so much in evidence
at one time in American Methodistical
parlors, “The Drunkard’s Home” and
“The Reformed Drunkard’s Home.”
She was of “squarish build.” She spoke
in “clear metallic accents” and one
judges that she spoke a lot. She was
quite a personality, in fact, despite the
verdict of Henry James, who esteemed
her “a poor, barbarous and merely in-
stinctive lady.”
Even though he saw her in company
with her beautiful young daughter,
R.L.S. fell in love with heir at first sight,
followed her to America, and after a
fantastic period of serious illness and
lovelorn penury married her; or per-
haps she married him.
From that moment the new Stevenson,
and in fact the Stevenson, began to take
shape. Mr. Elwin is instinctively in-
clined to treat Fanny as an annoying
excrescence on the life of his Bohemian
subject. There seems to be an undertone
of resentment in his writing at the com-
plete, and sometimes misapplied, domina-
tion which she established over her new
husband, as over Stevenson, senior, and
over his wife, who might have been ex-
pected, above all, to balk at the sudden
precipitation into her family circle of
this cast-off spouse of a sombreroed
American in highboots.
This, if the appearance of Mr. Elwin’s
attitude is reality, is somewhat ungrate-
ful. Without the interposition of Fanny
he would have had little to write about
except a vague and vagrant invalid, with
a modest output of two more-or-less
dilettante travel books to his credit, who
perished early and left no record behind
likely to inspire anybody but the
moralists.
Fanny may have established a rigid
control over her new husband. She may
have broken most of his friendships, in-
cluding that with poor old lonely Henley,
who, paradoxically, with his description
in the “London Voluntaries,” did more
than anybody except herself to create the
Stevenson of legend. She may have
sought to use his talent to her own glory.
She may have tried to bowdlerise his mind
and his writing. She may have
attempted, with little success, to make his
genius priggish. But it is not for these
things that she should be best re-
membered.
Whatever selfish motives lay behind
her general policy, it is beyond question
that her management of his parents
secured him enough to live on while
establishing himself; that if she had not
forced a rigid regimen upon him, con-
demning him to bed when seriously ill,
compelling him even to remain speech-
less for hours at a time when threatened
with haemorrhages, driving him to work
when fit for it, and managing his business
affairs, he would inevitably, as his will-
power weakened with the progress of his
malady, have become all Hyde with no
Jekyll in him.
She emerges from the tale as a female,
but greater, edition of Watts-Dunton, and
one feels that she would really have made
Something of Swinburne.
The squarish lady undoubtedly proved
herself able to subjugate her long sliver
of Bohemian nonconformity. She adapted
his undoubted genius to her purpose and
saw it securely harnessed to his taste in
plots, which was that of a healthy boy
of 15. She controlled his thirst (some-
times seal-like, save that seals drink
water) without bringing him to disaster.
And she eventually succeeded in pinning
him to the side of a once-cannibal island
in the wild South Seas, like a fly pinned
to a wall.
With all this she did not corrupt his
native innocence, muddy the purity
of his prose or cloud his crystalline
thought and diction. His greatest and
most distinctively original writing, such
as in The Ebb Tide, comes from his
South Seas period.
Stevenson himself would probably be
the first to admit that he owed to her
both his solid reputation and whatever
real happiness he enjoyed in his adult life,
apart from his happy ending.
He was with her on December 3, 1894,
helping her to prepare supper on the
veranda of his house at Vailima and gaily
talking, when he was suddenly struck
speechless by an apoplectic attack. It
was an ironic close to a life which had
been threatened by consumption for more
than 20 years. He was then only 44
years old.
Mr. Elwin’s hook was much needed.
Its publication will open the season for
the “debunkers” who have hitherto been
held in leash; but he has done his work
so well and with such an engaging frank-
ness that anything the muckrakers can do
will be rather ineffective.
The real Stevenson, as painted by him,
will wear more durably in the hall of
fame than the lay-figure built by Colvin
and by other protectors of his reputation.
M. H. E.
Ezra's Tribe.
One has always agreed with remarks
that Ezra Pound is a Great Influence on
the Young, a point of view he has done
much to encourage; but we see by his
letter of March 28, 1935, to T. S. Eliot—
The Letters of Ezra Pound, edited by D.
D. Paige (Faber) —that by the age of
49 Pound was beginning to despond,
either about his pupils’ prospects or
their abilities; his “Song for the Muses’
Garden” runs:
Ez Po and Possum
Have picked all the blossom,
Let all the others
Run back to their mothers
Per a boy’s bes’ friend iz biz CEdipus,
A boy’s best friend is his CEdipus. |
“Possum” is one of his names for
Eliot. And it looks as though he is right;
no better flowers will come from that
particular garden than these two friends
have harvested. But these letters show
something of Pound’s size as an en-
courager and editor in his earlier years
of men whose talent and technique were
formed independently of his own, for in
them we can follow all the urging and
haranguing which led to getting Eliot’s
“Prufrock” published; and we can
follow Pound’s efforts to interest people
in the unknown James Joyce to the
publication of Ulysses in “The Little Re-
view” under Pound’s editorship; first
heard of in a letter to H. L. Mencken
January 25, 1918;
Joyce’s new novel has a corking Ist.
Chap, (which will get us suppressed), not
such a good second one.
Again, from a letter to Joyce himself,
June, 1920:
Dear Joyce: I enclose letter from Quinn,
which you need not of necessity read. Point
is that “Nausikaa” has been pinched by the
po-lice. Only way to get Ulysses printed
in book form will be to agree not to print
any more of it in the L.R.
I have already made this suggestion on
other ground, namely that the expensive
private edition planned by Quinn wd. have
wider sale if it contained final chapters
which had not already appeared in print....
The best thing to do, now that things have
come to the present pass, is to turn the
whole matter over to Quinn. He is on the
spot and both will and can deal with local
conditions better than we can from here.
The excuse for parts of Ulysses is the
whole of Ulysses; the case for publication
of bits of it serially is weak; the editrices
having sent copy to someone who hadn’t
asked for it further weakens case.
This and other references and letters
to John Quinn, an American lawyer and
patron of the arts, show how well he de-
served his name in the Cantos as narrator
of the most charming and salty of their
anecdotes. One more short letter to
Joyce might be printed here, of July,
1920:
Dear James: News item or rather phrase
of conversation from ex-govt, official: “The
censorship was very much troubled by it
(Ulysses ) during the war. Thought it was
all in code.”
There are 384 letters in this collection;
To Harriet Monroe (of “Poetry,”
Chicago, which Pound represented in
England), H. L. Mencken (“My dearly
beeluvved Hank”), Wyndham Lewis, W.
B. Yeats, Edgar Jepson, E. E. Cummings,
Amy Lowell, Laurence Binyon (a long
discussion of Binyon’s translation of
Dante), Professor Felix Schelling, W.
H. D. Rouse, George Santayana, F. V.
Merely (on how to print the Cantos),
Marianne Moore, and many more.
The letters should be a valuable docu-
ment for the future. As a note to one
letter, for instance, the editor prints a
kind of circular Pound got out in 1922,
appealing for help for Eliot:
Wastage of literary prizes, Anatole France
deserved the Nobel Prize, but no one will
claim that giving it to him at age of 74
increases or betters his production.
Eliot, in bank, makes £5OO, Too tired to
write, broke down; during convalescence
in Switzerland did Waste Land, a master-
piece; one of most important 19 pages in
English.
Returned to bank, and is again gone to
pieces, physically.
It is not surprising, then, to find the
publishing firm of which Eliot became
a director sticking firmly to Pound, and
continuing to put out his books; it is
very pleasant; and it is in his letters to
Eliot that Pound’s softness and warmth,
a charm all his own, are most to be
found ; and especially in the later letters,
where he has developed a kind of comic
language, as for instance where Eliot has
asked him to write about Robert Bridges,
presumably for “The Criterion”;
Why don’t you say: “Will you do
10 quid worth of hack work?” I mean if
that’s what you do mean 1 take it all I
gotten do is talk about Britches, not neces-
sarily read the ole petrifaction Some-
thing ought certainly to be done to prevent
the sale of Oxford Press publications.
Thaaar I am wiff yuh.
The letters, as all Pound’s work, show
him as a straightforward, down-to-earth
man, ready to talk about writing with
anyone in the sky or in the gutter; it is
strange to think that his name was the
rallying-cry of the Superior Person of the
15 or 20 years up to the recent war. This

WATERFRONT VICIOUSNESS
Most Australians have read with wrath
Press summaries of the Stevedoring
Industry Board’s report on the entirely
evil forces devoted to sabotaging the
maritime industry in Australia. Even so
the public needs to know more of the
report—and of what isn’t reported— to
get an inkling of the malignancy at work
under influences hostile to the Govern-
ment, the laws of the land and the
welfare of this Commonwealth.
The Commonwealth Ministry cannot
be ignorant of the damage being done
and the evil forces operating. Its
limitation of action—so far as the
public knows —to the commissioning of
an overseas expert to investigate is
altogether ridiculous.
For years the public has been told
at irregular intervals of prevalent loafing
on the waterfront, looting of cargoes and
inability of such subordinate authorities
as watchmen and “wharf police” to con-
trol abuses in the least. It has not
been told and every shipping company
in the land must have been able to tell
it—of such things as the constant
bashings by thugs of those conscientious
foremen who try to do their duty and
must take their lives in their hands as
they go about it. The conditions revealed
by the Stevedoring Board are doubly a
disgrace to this Government authority—
they are a disgrace in themselves, and a
worse disgrace in the fact that Canberra
and the 5.1.8. agency must for long have
known about them.
Last week in Parliament the Minister
for Shipping appeared wringing his
hands over two flagrant acts of political
rebellion by ships’ crews—the holding-up
of a Governnient wheatship in Port
Adelaide, a vessel specially ordered there
to lift wheat urgently required in Tas-
mania, and of the newly-commissioned
freighter Borda, in Sydney on her maiden
inter-State voyage, upon some flimsy com-
plaint about the size of standard-
designed ashpit-doors.
The Aorangi was marooned for a
month in Sydney without a crew, and the
Commonwealth Government waited all
that time before ordering naval ratings
to take her to sea, and even then the
instructions to the Navy were issued with
every expression of desire not to hurt the
defaulting seamen’s feelings or obstruct
their probable intention to return to
work at the last moment. In this last
matter at least the Government was
successful. The only feelings hurt were
the Navy’s.
The action at last apologetically
resorted to could have been, and should
have been, taken weeks earlier.
The same attitude of weak-kneed sur-
render to a mob of scoffing strikers was
shown in the port of Mackay, in North
Queensland. Sugar-farmers, obeying a
call from the Commonwealth Minister
for Labor, came in to load the Well-
park with the sugar left to rot in the
wharf-sheds. They worked for several
days at a rate which made the usual
wharfies’ rate of loading look silly. And
then they were dismissed without notice
on the last day because the strikers
had consented to resume for a few hours’
finishing off, entitling them to “attendance
money” till next ship arrives.
The authority which allowed this
scandalous pandering to the strikers was
a branch of the same 5.1.8. which now
reports the shocking conditions prevalent
on the wharves in all ports, in all States,
under its own jurisdiction. It cannot too
strongly be emphasised that the 5.1.8. is
telling its sob-story for the 12 months
ended a year ago, and that that story,
calculated to make anyone’s blood boil
outside the kindred bureaucracy of Can-
berra, was tabled in Parliament only last
week!
Inflation, is it? The community is in
the unbreakable grip of high costs, these
politicians tell us! Let every citizen read
the official-reported facts and ask him-
self why he should be condemned, with
two Governments, Federal and State,
operating at mounting expense in every
State in the supposed business of regu-
lating the national economy, to pay for
9.000. hours annually wasted in loafing
on the wharves and paid for as hours
worked. And this on top of “attendance-
money.” No Australian is going to think
noble thoughts of his rulers and tighten
his belt while unions in Government-
managed industries—they all seem to
catch the same demoralisation germ—
demand more and more pay for “work”
which consists (says the 5.1.8.) in
Playing cards or tvvo-np.
Sitting about or fishing.
Absence without employers’ knowledge
and without being reported absent.
Being taken up drunk while supposed to
be on the job and listed as “ceased work
owing to illness.”
Coming and going as they like under a
“deplorably low standard of supervision.”
“Colossal wastage” for many other
reasons.
In this well-nigh incredible report of
loafing, insolence and immunity, and the
consequent demoralisation, the words of
the 5.1.8. are theses
Men were found playing cards or two-up,
sitting idle on ships or wharves—in some
cases fishing, leaving jobs and remaining
absent without permission or knowledge
of their employers, and in some cases
taking it in turns to go home or stay home
from their jobs without being disciplined
or .reported by the employers—indeed,
being paid for their absence as though
they had worked.
....in the port of Melbourne there came
to the Board’s notice an alarming number
of cases of waterside workers having been
arrested by police for drunkenness and
like offences during their time of employ-
ment and without the knowledge of their
employers.
Anyone who knows anything of the
whole truth of the happenings which
darkly background the picture of general
chaos must know—and this should go
for the S.l.B.—that the waterfront has
turned vicious. Bashings, crude black-
mail, intimidation and “accidents” to
foremen are in that picture.
From all the signs the Shipping Board
could produce a companion picture to
this in revelation of union revolt against
authority, and if he could have that pic-
ture, too, the citizen might then under-
stand one reason why he must constantly
pay more and more for everything he
eats or wears or uses. He is paying for
the laying-up in ports of dozens of idle
ships, costing tens of thousands of
pounds daily in demurrage, at the whim
of Communist union-executives which
defy State and Federal Governments
with impunity. He is paying for it in
rising freight-charges, insurance indemni-
ties for looted cargoes, higher prices of
imported goods, which compound again
the cost of home-manufactures, and
higher prices for coal and every basic
material and service caught up in the
train of this utter corruption of all dignity
of labor when organised for blackmail
of its employer.
Incidentally, these are, one must
assume, some of the “hard-won condi-
tions” which union secretaries defend
with political strikes against every
legislative or administrative effort pro-
posed (and hitherto only proposed) for
correction of abuses. If unions persist
in political strikes, with the Arbi-
tration Court Bench declaring that it is
not equipped to deal with political strikes,
then those unions must expect strict
amendment of the law. Every rebel
union is now preparing new general
political strikes to protest against that.
The now-announced referendum on
the anti-Communist Act is still months
off; any procedure thereafter can hardly
begin before 1952 ; and the country is
supposed to get ready to meet a possible
outbreak of war in 1953. But the Gov-
ernment is not supposed to remain
entirely powerless till time and fate, in
happy conjunction, remove its difficulties
along a preferred line of action.
It can warn the watersiders’ and
seamen’s unions that it refuses further
to expose its own authority need-
lessly to defiance —that it will wipe
the Stevedoring and Shipping Board
off the map, give the employers
back full control over their own
business and restrict the Government
interest to enforcing the rule of industrial
law over both parties. No remnant is
left of any treasured belief among the
public that strife in a key industry from
the discontent of a militant union can be
cured by the Government’s “taking over”
the industry. Experience is all the other
way. Government interference aggravates
the trouble if only because what the
5.1. calls the “deplorable standard of
supervision” under such control rebounds
against the Government’s own authority,
either in general as representing the
Sovereign or in particular as an employer.
The shipping companies might then be
free to apply to the Court for deregistra-
tion of the unions and a cancellation of
beneficial award conditions as a penalty
for refusal of labor without due notice.
But while Ministers are obliged to feel
that they are personally responsible for
digging coal, moving ships and shifting
cargoes as well as for general administra-
tion of the law, they will probably fall
down in the lot.
To the “difficulties of the problem”
which it faces, and which quite defeated
the late Chifley Government, Mr. Menzies
must find some swift action—for the evil
is corrupting not merely the present-day
economy but also the entire community.
"Labor's" Communist
Hypocrisy.
The decisions of the A.L.P. Executive in
Canberra last week should show both
the Government and the country the true
nature of that body. And they, and the
rest of the record, have to be kept in
mind for an understanding of “Labor's”
protective stand for Communism in the
coming referendum.
At a time when the international situa-
tion is ominous, and when Communist
sabotage is tearing Australia to pieces
and endangering both its security and its
economic system, all the “Labor” Execu-
tive, headed by an ex-Communist presi-
dent who still speaks the language of
Communism, is concerned about is the
destruction of the Government.
It does not matter that the Govern-
ment has been elected to office for the
second time in 18 months by an over-
whelming majority. The Government
must be wrecked by any means to hand
and Mr. Ferguson hopes for another
election as early as possible.
It does not matter that the last time
he went to the country only two months
ago Mr. Menzies asked for a clear
mandate on a clear bill to deal with
Communism, the details of which had
been thrashed-out in Parliament* and
voted for by Parliament, including the
“Labor” party.
It does not matter that the electors
when asked to return the Government
specifically to pass this bill gave the Gov-
ernment an instruction and the authority
to find a decisive way of passing it,
through the referendum or otherwise.
The A.L.P. is not concerned with the
opinion of the electorates. It is only
concerned with the “rights” of the trade-
unions: i.e., of the irresponsible juntas
which control them and over which the
rank-and-file of unionists have no
authority. Its only concern with Parlia-
ment is that it should cease to be a free
deliberative assembly responsible only to
the people.
Mr. Ferguson and his Communist-
minded followers will tolerate no Parlia-
ment which does not do their bidding,
no Parliament which is not prepared to
observe any policy which they authorise
in dark recesses of their little Kremlin,
no leader who will not knuckle down and
be a tame Red gramophone mouthing
their jargon, as Dr. Evatt last week was
mouthing it when he spoke of the
“Fascist tactics” of the Menzies Govern-
ment —because that Government was
about to take steps, specifically for which
it was elected, against men and bodies
engaged in treason, whose machina-
tions are costing every peaceful country
in the world hundreds and even
thousands of millions of pounds for
defence and tens of thousands of lives
annually.
The A.L.P. has become a dark, sinister
and dangerous force since it first began
to be groomed by that secret Communist
Mr. J. S. Garden 20 years ago. It has
neither consistency nor ethics, nor can
the party which it directs in Parliament.
Its decisions are taken where its pro-
ceedings cannot be known. It has no
principle except that of expediency. It
prates of its hatred of Communism while
the strongest unions at the back of it are
Communist-led. It lauds its own efforts
—led by men who themselves were open
Communists for years, some of them
high officials of the Communist party —to
“destroy” Communism ; but it is always
clear that its main enemy is not Com-
munism, which its Dr. Evatt told Parlia-
ment was operating “for the sole purpose
of defeating the Australian defence
policy in the interests of a foreign
Power,” but the Menzies Government.
Its whole attitude to Communism is a
matter of barefaced hypocrisy, as is
easily proved from its own decisions.
The resolutions of the 1948 conference
embodied the policy which “Labor”
Parliamentarians were last week ordered
by the Executive to follow implicity. The
conference “reaffirmed its repudiation of
the methods and principles of the Com-
munist party, and the decisions of
previous conferences that between the
Communist party and the Labor party
there is such basic hostility and
differences that no Communist can be a
member of the Labor party.” Yet the
president of the A.L.P. is a man who
walked straight out of the Communist
party into high office in the “Labor”
party. He represents on the Federal
Executive the N. S. Wales State branch,
two of whose three trustees have been
leading Communist officials —one official
trade-union leader and the other general-
secretary and treasurer of the Communist
party.
While the foregoing declaration
appears on page 50 of the official report
of the 19,48 A.L.P. Federal Conference
there is printed 14 pages further on in the
report a document headed “Australian
Labor Party Directory” announcing that
“political or industrial Labor organisa-
tions overseas desiring information in
respect to Labor or other conditions in
Australia may obtain the same on appli-
cation to any of the above secretaries.”
Among the “above secretaries” named in
this official directory is “M. Healy,
Trades Hall, Brisbane, Australia,” one of
the most notorious and active Com-
munists in the country.
Apart from this, Communist
“auxiliaries and subsidiaries” cannot be
“associated with the Labor party in any
activity.” Yet the Federal Ironworkers’
Association and the 8.W.1.U. and the
Waterside Workers, and some more
which are Communist auxiliaries, are all
parts of the A.L.P. and finance the
“Labor” operations of its Fergusons and
Evatts, who profess to hate them. And
when elections come along the secretaries
of these Communist bodies sign adver-
tisements advising the electors to return
the A.L.P.’s candidates. In the referen-
dum they and “Labor” will campaign side
by side.
All this calls for explanation, but it
will not be explained any more than the
next clause of the resolution which the
A.L.P. conference in 1948 passed, and
which the Executive says must bind its
followers. In this it declared that “the
policy and actions of the Communist
party demonstrate that the party's
methods and objects aim at the destruc-
tion of the democratic way of life of the
Australian people and the establishment
in its place of a totalitarian form of Gov-
ernment which would destroy our existing
democratic institutions and the personal
liberty of the Australian people.”
We therefore declare [said the confer-
ence] that the A.1.P., through its branches,
affiliations and members, must carry on an
increasing campaign directed at destroying
the influence of the Communist party
wherever such exists throughout Australia.
Yet in the face of this the conference de-
clared that any proposal for the banning
of a political party because of hostility
and objection to its platform and beliefs,
no matter how repugnant such may be, is
a negation of democratic principles, and
should be rejected.
Conference considers that freedom of ex-
pression enables the community to deter-
mine the soundness or otherwise of political
philosophies, and to reject such views as
are inimical to the party’s interests.
The inconsistency between “Labor’s”
professed view of Communism and its
view of what measures should be taken
against it is bewildering enough by itself,
but when it is read in the light of its
attitude to its own internal affairs it is
staggering.
In its resolutions at the 1948 confer-
ence it based its abhorrence of any plan
to ban a political party on its “adherence
to the basic freedoms of right of associa-
tion and the right of expression which
are the fundamental principles associated
with the Australian democratic way of
life.”
Does it practice those principles in its
own party?- Combined with its shouted
determination to do or die —come
treason, sabotage, intimidation and the
destruction of the Australian way of life
—rather than sacrifice the freedom of the
Communist party to remain the agent of
“a foreign Power operating for the sole
purpose of defeating the Australian
defence policy,” its executive almost in
the same breath asked the State branches
to restrain Federal and State “Labor”
politicians from criticising their leaders
and party policy. It seems that the Vic-
torian and Western Australian branch
majorities had desired to censure Dr.
Evatt for associating himself in court
with the Communist cause, and other
people in the Federal caucus have been
openly criticising the A.L.P. policy on
Communism and wish to help the Gov-
ernment to put a ban on the Communist
party.
The A.L.P. \yill have none of this.
The sections of the “Labor” programme
revised at the 1948 conference affirming
the need for “freedom of expression to
enable the public to determine the sound-
ness or otherwise of political philo-
sophies,” can be plainly labelled: “For
the benefit of the Communist party only.’


PLAIN ENGLISH
Preparedness Controls.
The nature of the controls asked for
by the Prime Minister in the Defence
Preparations Bill shows how serious the
Government considers the international
situation to be and how high it rates the
necessity for preparedness.
In his speech on the Anti-Communist
Bill Mr. Menzies stressed the fact that the
Government, with its confidential and
high-level sources, is in a special posi-
tion to measure the perils to which the
Commonwealth is subject, and conse-
quently the extent of the measures which
are required to prepare for the immediate
future.
While the bill is one which should be
minutely and thoroughly examined by
Parliament to assure that it goes no
further than is warranted, its temporary
nature has been particularly emphasised
by Mr. Menzies, and, as he also empha-
sised, it does not, anyway, go as far as
legislation for the same purpose goes in
Canada, Britain and America.
The “Labor” attempt to deny a Govern-
ment mandate on the issue is, of course,
preposterous. In his policy speech Mr.
Menzies specifically stated:
In the new Parliament we will bring
down a Defence Preparations Bill to in-
stitute such needed controls as may be
thought to be within the limits of the
Commonwealth Constitution... .They will
be adopted only if emergency renders them
necessary for the protection of the people.
It should be made very plain indeed
that it is only a measure of expediency
needed to meet a peculiar set of circum-
stances which endanger our existence and
does not establish any fixed principle.
When passed. Parliament should rigidly
control its operations and scrutinise the
regulations made under it.
Even in the hands of a “free-enterprise”
Government such powers call for careful
policing, and should be administered only
with meticulous care to safeguard con-
stitutional rights. In the hands of a class-
war Government of a present “Labor”
type, controlled from without by a secret
union junta, it might provide the
machinery for misuse, even though it
excludes authority for compulsory direc-
tion of labor, compulsory military service
and the raising of revenue by borrowing
or taxation.
Hie Anti-Communist Bill.
Mr. Menzies proposes to make no
mistake this time about securing full
power to deal with the Communist party.
He will ask at the constitutional refer-
endum to be taken on the bill ( a ) for
general authority under an amendment
of -the Constitution to make “such laws
with respect to Communists or Com-
munism as the Parliament considers
necessary or expedient for the defence
and security of the Commonwealth or
the maintenance of the Constitution and
laws,” and ( b) for special authority to
pass the Communist-party Dissolution
Act and to vary or repeal it.
The Dissolution Bill will be very much
in the form in which it was declared
invalid by the High Court purely on
the basis of the limits of constitutional
power. It will provide, as before, for the
dissolution of the Communist party, as
an illegal body, and for a receivership of
its property. It will authorise the
Government to declare illegal any Com-
munist affiliated or associated body where
the Government is satisfied that the
existence of that body is prejudicial to
the safety of the Commonwealth or Con-
stitution or to defence. It will also permit
the “declaration” of Communists and
members of declared organisations, this
automatically disqualifying them from
holding office in any union engaged in
industry vital to defence or security.
All these measures are safeguarded by
right-of-appeal provisions which are far
more stringent than those in many acts
passed or operated by “Labor” Govern-
ments and affecting the liberty of the
subject.
Security Score.
Following the discovery that radar
equipment on H.M.A.S. Sydney had
been sabotaged, a section of the Sydney
Press became eager to prove how easy
it is for myrmidons of the enemy to pene-
trate the defences of the Navy ashore, at
Garden Island.
It was obvious, of course, that the
attack on the Sydney could not have been
the work of any casual snooper, since
it required detailed knowledge of the
ship and the radar plant, and could
only have been done by somebody with
special opportunity and certain tools at his
disposal. In a world in which the head
of the most important foreign department
in the British Foreign Office can dis-
appear without trace and atom scientists
of world-renown carrying some of the
earth’s most dangerous secrets cannot be
trusted to be loyal, these things are apt
to happen.
In the newspaper scare, reporters or
photographers revealed the secrets of a bit
of ground which can be seen plainly from
surrounding tops of flats on Potts Point
and made observations of what is going
on in the squadron about a tenth as effec-
tive as can be made from a veranda in
North Sydney with a glass. In the pro-
ceedings figured an expired workers’-
pass which somebody had picked-up in a
bar or somewhere, and which had about
as much chance of passing the holder to
anywhere worth while without suspicion
as a bottle of beer would have of lasting
10 seconds in George-street at five in the
afternoon.
In another newspaper sleuth-splurge,
“spies” had an open go at R.A.A.F. head-
quarters. They could, apparently, get
into the Lapstone Hotel! There were a
couple of palings out of the fence.
Anybody who knows anything about
security knows that the test of it is not
whether it stops a reporter with a dud
pass at a gate. Indeed, no security
measure is worth while if it stops anybody
with suspicious intentions at his fi!rst
attempt. Commonsense dictates that the
aim should be —as it usually is—to “kid”
the suspect along, let him in, have a
watch put on him. If he aims to do
damage, he is stopped. If he is on recon-
naissance the aim is to find out firstly
what he is after and secondly who sent
him and why. Then either routine pre-
caution protects against him and his
associates or he is given opportunity to
act so that he and fellow-conspirators
can be grabbed.
It is a security axiom that no safety
measure is perfect if the ill-intentioned
know it is there and can recognise it on
sight. It is also an axiom that no security
system can be foolproof. Having regard
to the manner in which unions concerned
with defence work have been honey-
combed by Communists, and the slack-
ness which developed perforce from
sheer political reasons during the reign
of the “Labor” Governments, it is a
marvel that defence works have suffered
so little.
Generally speaking, despite the ability
of reporters to walk occasionally through
the rooms at Victoria Barracks, Sydney
—which, of course, are fairly heaped
with secret codes and copies of the War
Book! —and to report, as one did recently
on the evidence of a pile of empty
cases, that the Army had tons of bombs
stacked out in the open for anybody to
steal at South Head, the public has fairly
good reason to refrain from losing sleep.
The dangerous enemy sabotage in Aus-
tralia is organised in civilian avenues —
on the wharves and ships and in indus-
tries, but on that subject the - Press is
remarkably mild.
From the 40 Thieves' Kitchen.
During the past week actors in the
Persian slapstick show have heard great
argument and repeatedly come out by the
same door as in they went. On latest
report they were preparing to approach
U.N.O. — the most wonderful of all doors
for that particular result.
The British Government’s mostly off-
stage participation in the dispute—barring
the sending of a cruiser to stand-by
inside the Shatt-el-Arab estuary—
is not to be misconstrued, for these oil
companies are generally capable of hold-
ing their own in diplomatic barneys of
this sort.
But, of course, this is the Persian Gulf,
and within the region which the Soviet
in its dead-and-gone alliance with Hitler
for the first years of World War II had
earmarked for Russian imperialist expan-
sion. Even a half-wit Persian Premier
could start a world war in that locality.
The Shah of Persia had followed Mr.
Moussadek into a spell of sickness —
appendicitis this time —and from the bed
where he alternately sobs and threatens,
the Persian Premier continues to control
every whisper in the Persian Parliament,
where his followers number about a
dozen in an assembly of about 200.
Actually the Persian Parliament (Mejliss)
does not count for anything ; any fanatics
of the Sunni sect can dominate it; and
it is less than 50 years since the Shah
introduced the idea of dissolving Parlia-
ment by bombarding it with artillery.
After a couple of days of trying to ride
off in opposite directions —threatening
any British employee of the oil company
with arrest for sabotage (penalty death)
if oil production stopped, and trying to
persuade the said employees to stay in
Persian Government employment and
watch the refinery cease production be-
cause export had ceased —the dolorous
Moussadek was understood by some
Press correspondent to “promise” to
withdraw the fatal sabotage bill. Since
this legislation did not appear before the
Mejliss on the due date, somebody was
evidently seriously having second
thoughts.
One British tanker, the J>olabella —
“good old Dolabella”—got away after
giving the ordinary A.-P. receipt for its
cargo, was threatened with interception
by the Persian Navy, and radioed for
“permission to ram the entire Persian
Navy on sight.” This, however, was
outside the bounds of the oil company’s
diplomatic sphere; and the more effec-
tive riposte to the Persian demands
(namely, for receipts which would have
given away the company’s legal case) was
to order all waiting tankers (some 60 or
70) to leave port. In this action all world
oil companies co-operated.
Since Abadan cannot continue to
operate unless its refined products are
exported, withdrawal of shipping is as
sure a method of closing down as any
Persian action.
The whole slapstick show could take
now a most ominous turn, plainly stated
by British Foreign Secretary Herbert
Morrison: “Can you think of a situa-
tion better calculated for exploitation by
Communism? If that happens not only
Persia but the whole world may suffer
the effects.”
Coddling the Thief.
Penalties imposed by the law for wrong-
doing are intended to punish and deter.
Those imposed on the type of lout con-
victed of “joyriding” in somebody else’s
motor-car are more likely to encourage.
In two separate Sydney courts on one
day last week the uselessness of the
present law covering this type of offence
was exposed. In one case an 18-year-old
youth, after pleading guilty to seven
charges of having “illegally used motor-
cars,” and being described as the ring-
leader of a gang who “systematically
took cars for joyriding,” was fined £25
and let off a jail sentence on a good-
behavior bond. In the other, a 21-year-
old, facing another charge, heard read
a list of his convictions running back
five years “mostly concerning the illegal
use of motor-vehicles.”
Plainly the first youth (or his gang)
scorned any penalties they might suffer
when caught, and aren’t likely to be de-
terred by the minor punishment inflicted
on the leader —a woman convicted of
shoplifting an article worth 10s. would
hardly get off as lightly. If the second
had got what he should have got for his
“illegal use of motor-vehicles” he
wouldn’t have been at large.
The law affecting these offences has
needed amending for years. The distinc-
tion between theft and “illegally using”
a vehicle worth anything from £3OO to
£l5OO is absurd. If the law is too meti-
culous about what constitutes theft, then
the Act should be amended to make the
penalties for the “minor” offence 10 times
what they are.
The motor-owner is entitled to protec-
tion in this regard. Before he can run
the car he must pay steep registration-
fees and motor-taxes, is required compul-
sorily to insure the entire populace
against being injured by his car, pays
ordinary insurance against damage and
theft, must know a host of traffic rules
and regulations, and pays heavy sales-tax
for repairs as well as tax on the fuel he
burns. Yet any lout can take the car,
drive it 10 to 1000 miles, put the owner
to all sorts of inconvenience and loss, and
if convicted get off with a fine which, in
these days, doesn’t amount to a week’s
wages.
Almost every week, somewhere or
other, the police bring “joyriders” into
the courts. Not the least disturbing
aspect is that in many instances a police-
car has had to chase the stolen car at
high speeds through suburban streets
to capture the driver. Accidents have
resulted ; sometimes with death or injury
to bystanders. And, so far from “joy-
riding” being the aim, most car thefts
are for dismantling and selling or using
the parts.
Light fines and good-behavior bonds
will not stop this sort of thing.
History on Show.
The lubilee exhibition of the Royal
Historical Society—the third it has held
—in the Education Building, Sydney, is
something every Australian would profit
by seeing.
It presents, chiefly by paintings and
portraits, an episodic picture of main
events of Australian development. There
are museum pieces from every age. The
story of the post-office is told by exhibits
almost from the beginning. The story
of the churches is illustrated—with some
humor in the case of St. Mary’s Catholic
chapel, the forerunner of the present
basilica, which was erected partly by a
public subscription - list headed by
Governor Macquarie’s secretary, J. T.
Campbell, the firmest Orangeman in the
country.
The growth of Sydney is shown in
detail from the time when Simeon Lord’s
old buildings—but not the ones which
living oldsters remember at the corner
of Bridge-street—stood in the middle or
thereabouts of Macquarie-place; the
buildings the old convict merchant sold
to the Government in exchange for
approximately 18,000 acres of outback
pastoral land.
A display of portraits of early
pioneers shown by the Women’s Pioneer
Society points the fact that pioneer
women were very much more good-
looking than pioneer men.
Here are a pair of Captain Piper’s
duelling pistols, with the stocks burned
off. Did he, perhaps, lend them to
Captain Macarthur —to whom he was
second in a famous duel —to shoot
Colonel Paterson in 1801? They should
be identifiable, for there was a great cry
about the defectiveness of the lock of
one of them at the time. It should be
worth while to find out, because one shot
which caught “poor old Paterson” in the
shoulder and nearly immolated him set-
off a train of events which ended in the
popularisation of Australian wool and
the foundation of Camden Park.
Near them is all Sir Edmund Barton’s
regalia: his orders and decorations, his
court-dress and much more; his fee-
book—and his sword! What would
Uncle Toby’s cronies of the morning
rum-party at Burdekin House—Jack
Want, K.C., et al —have given to see him
wielding a sticker? And there are some
splendid examples of Henry Parkes’s
skill as a carver of ivory.
Also, among a multitude of interesting
sets of illustrations of national progress,
victory and defeat, are the bushranging
items. It is something of a mystery of
human nature that in a country whose
history includes Pozibres, Villers-
Bretonneux and Mont St. Quentin, not
to mention Gallipoli and Alamein, the
public will turn aside from anything to
look at such relics. As well as flattering
portraits of Ned Kelly and his sister Kate
(dressed in a riding habit like a duchess)
there are also the hallowed gyves which
Mr. Kelly wore at Glenrowan after his
arrest, and the police pistol, taken by
him from the corpse of one of his victims,
which was found in his possession when
he was grabbed.
Ben Hall is also given prominence. His
taste in weapons was more aristocratic
than Ned’s, and his beautiful long-
barrelled 1854-55-model Tranter per-
cussion revolver, with every accessory
that money could buy, will be coveted
by students and collectors of firearms.
Its decoration is ornate and its workman-
ship fine. It would be almost a pleasure
to be shot by such a weapon.
Looking at these things it becomes
really amazing that in this Jubilee-Year
exhibition there should be no honor for
the fighting men who made this country a
nation through World Wars I and 11, and
so much publicity for its lawbreakers.
Behind That Curtain.
From London: Mrs. Monica Felton,
member of the Labor party, is certainly
making the most of her trips to
Moscow and North Korea. Vociferously
welcomed by the “Daily Worker” on her
return, she has been the Communists
leading exhibit for some weeks.
This observer, eager to note at first-
hand the carrying-out of a Moscow
directive (in this instance, the attempted
breakdown of Anglo-American relations)
went along to the local hall where Mrs.
Felton was billed to speak.
In an atmosphere highly-charged with
potential emotion an audience that con-
tained a large proportion of eccentrics,
neurotics and colored people bought
pamphlets on “The People’s China and
“A New Light on Korea” and passed
round a “peace” petition.
Mrs. Felton, who is red-haired, good-
looking, badly-crippled and has pro-
nounced nervous mannerisms, rose to a
burst of hand-clapping that went on for
a good two minutes.
She spoke long but said little specific:
a heart-searing but vague and repetitive
recital of bomb-damage and civilian hard-
ship ; allusions to American atrocities,
qualified by the statement that she didn’t
actually witness any but saw evidence of
their having been done; and a compli-
cated narration about letters from British
p.-0.-w. in North Korea. She had, she
said, brought back 26 of these letters
and gave to understand that both British
and U.S. prisoners were well-treated and
were forming “peace” committees among
themselves, and that many of them were
convinced that they were on the wrong
side She closed with passionate fervor

that it was the duty of public opinion to
stop the war in Korea before it was too
late.
The chairman called upon the secretary
of the London Committee of the Britain-
China Friendship Association (under
whose auspices the meeting was held).
With a foreign accent, the sec. referred
to Mrs. Felton’s “great and noble social
experiments” and to more members being
needed for the B.C.F.A. By writing their
names and addresses on the envelopes that
were being passed round and enclosing
2s. 6d. all could join, and £1 Is. would
include literature. “As a start,” he held
up two £l-notes, which “a gentleman
had handed to him.”
Question-time came. The chairman
asked for them to be plain and direct
just: “Is it —or isn’t it—so?” Was there
any evidence that the first aggression
came from the south? Yes, said Mrs.
Felton. Why only 26 letters? They were
given to her just as she left; and they
weren’t from the “good boys” only, for
some never mentioned the “peace” move-
ment. Yes, she could have visited the
camp, but it was a 10-day trip either way
and she had “an important engagement
in London.” How were the wounded
treated? Difficult to answer, since every
hospital had been razed. Were the land
and factories handed over to the people
by the new Government? Yes, indeed.
Had she any information of Russian
influence in North Korea? She had kept
her eyes open, but saw no evidence of
Soviet equipment. The delegation did
eat, however, Russian delicacies that had
been bought by Koreans.
The one question that seemed out of
character came from the back of the hall.
A young woman asked: “How much
does this meeting owe to the Communist
party?” The chairman rose, apparently
deeply injured, held an expression of
virtuous indignation for a moment, and
then asked for the next question. The
young woman stepped into the aisle and
shouted: “You’re a lot of damned
traitors, that’s what you are!” But the
feeling of the meeting (apart from some
scattered and rather timid “hear, hears”)
was against her and quickly resumed its
exchanges of mutual anger and reassur-
ances.
Conclusions, in brief: that Mrs.
Felton is adept at knowing, and giving,
answers; that everybody present knew
that the meeting was Communist-inspired
and most felt embarrassed at not being
able to hide it; that some avowed Corns
can be pitiable, but all fellow-travellers
are objectionable; that Britain’s Com-
munist party is getting into very deep
water and may already have overstretched
itself.
POLITICAL POINTS
Although the world knows that in
Korea Soviet Russia has been fighting a
war by proxy, Moscow has all along pro-
fessed to be merely a sympathetic non-
combatant friend of the North Koreans.
Communist China’s attitude has been
somewhat similar —the Peking Govern-
ment is not at war; the Chinese troops
in Korea are all volunteers, and you
can’t stop volunteers from rushing to the
aid of friends brutally attacked. Yet the
Kremlin, through Malik, had only to give
the word and the Chinese “volunteers”
and the North Korean “patriots” fell into
line with his truce-talk suggestion, though
both had ignored similar approaches
from the United Nations.
Ten car loads of Communist
negotiators came down from the north
in Korea to Kaesong in the no-man’s-
land just south of the 38th Parallel to
meet the Allied delegation, and agreement
was reached to discuss full-scale cease-
fire negotiations. The whole world hopes
that the negotiations will be successful,
and that they are not just the product of
just another Communist manoeuvre in the
campaign for world revolution.

When Mr. McKell was appointed G.-G.
Mr. Menzies described the appointment
as “the most deplorable incident in the
Government’s growing record of political
jobbery,” adding later that “if it hap-
pened that an incoming Government
removed Mr. McKell.... the position
would be welcomed, because it would
restore the Governor-Generalship to its
true position and character.” Now Mr.
McKell goes to England, it is reported
on Mr. Menzies’s advice, to talk oyer the
arrangements for the Royal visit next
year. If this is true it seems that Mr.
Menzies intends to extend the G.-G. term
over the period of the Royal tour.
No sooner was the Stevedoring Indus-
try Board’s first comprehensive report
issued —it is for 1949-50 —and Press sum-
maries given, than Mr. Monk, of the
A.C.T.U., was denying that unionists
were to blame for the shipping lag; Mr.
Lee, of the shipping people, was denying
that his crowd was at fault; Mr. Fell, of
the Employers’ Federation, was laying
responsibility on the 5.1.8.; and Mr.
Nelson, of the wharfies’ union, was de-
claring that his chaps were blameless.
Apparently these things just happen.
In its search for a formula to justify
its opposition to the Anti-Red referendum
the A.L.P. executive dug-up a 1948 reso-
lution declaring that the banning of a
political party was “a negation of demo-
cratic principles.” No one has come
forward to explain why the resolution
didn’t prevent “Labor” from voting for
the Anti-Communist bill last year after
turning a somersault. Democratic prin-
ciples came a poor second to expediency
when it was a matter of dodging an elec-
tion on an unpopular issue.
Anyway, isn’t it time “Labor” faced
realities and stopped talking of Com-
munism as a political party?
Repeating “Labor’s” cry that the Red
referendum is unnecessary as the Gov-
ernment has sufficient power under the
Crimes to deal with the Communists,
Dr, Evatt said in a broadcast that the
Government was afraid to use the Crimes
Act for that purpose because it would
have to ask the Supreme Court or the
High Court to declare the Communist
party illegal; it was seeking a referendum
so that it could take this action
arbitrarily. That is rather ia strange
remark to come from a jurist of Evatt's
experience. If a majority of electors in a
majority of States agrees to outlaw the
Communist party how can the Govern-
ment be acting arbitrarily in doing so?
According to Victorian “Labor”-
leader Cain Australians are becoming a
“pill-swallowing community.” Quite so ;
but fortunately they have so far refused
to swallow the Socialist pill.
In the past week or so there have been
persistent reports from America that the
U.S. Army intends to use large quantities
of artificial fibres in Army uniforms.
Eric Johnston, head of the Economic
Stabilisation Agency, said the idea was
aimed at reducing the price of wool and
the substitute “appeared to be just as
good as wool under supervised tests.”
There is no artificial fibre, and there never
will be one, “just as good as wool” for
wearing apparel, for the simple reason
that wool is a living fibre whereas the
nylons and such are dead products of
the chemist. Even so, wool has some-
thing to fear in that its scarcity will boost
artificials, whose sponsors have millions
to spend on propaganda —and will spend
them.
A circular from Queensland Land
Administration Board bears this admoni-
tion in the top right-hand comer:
“Important! When replying quote the
number: Batch 1234.” Yes, it’s got so
they now have to number the batches of
files they keep.
Charges made by H. Clarke, secretary
of the Victorian branch of the Water-
siders’ Federation, indicate that there is
no limit to Communist effrontery.
Reds on the executive of the W.W.F.
proposed that former members re-
turning from Korea or Japan should
not be automatically admitted to
the union, but should be treated “as
having left to join another industry.”
The proposal was defeated, as was
another Communist motion to cancel the
membership of wharfies who joined the
Army. The Corns probably didn’t expect
it to succeed, but its mere discussion
would to some extent serve their purpose
of discouraging enlistment in the Forces.
America has a ban on lotteries, but big
business there conducts them. There’s a
war on for the soft-drink trade in
Mexico, and the competitors include
lucky numbers on the bottle labels and
in bottle-tops which might win anything
from a Cadillac car to a carton of
smokes. The Mexes are going for it with
their ears back, and the prize-giving stunt
is spreading to airlines, cosmetics, tinned-
dog makers and even “sellers of Govern-
ment savings bonds.” S’Artie must sigh
with envy.
Treading the ground that every
member of his party has tramped over
a dozen times in the last five years. Doc.
Evatt, in debating the Bank Bill, com-
plained that the restoration of the Com-
monwealth Bank Board would mean that
amateurs would be brought into the
board-room “with power to overrule the
technicians, and then hurry back to them
own private businesses and interests.”
Central banking, said the Doc., was no
longer a business for amateurs. For that
matter it never was, but in the sense in
which Evatt uses the term almost every
central bank in the free world is con-
trolled by amateurs. That includes the
Bank of England, socialised by the Attlees
in 1946.

Most piquant news of the week came
from New York, where for four months
a factory had labored to make a candle
with a wick the size of a thick rope and
containing a ton of wax, at a cost of
£12,000. Intended for the United Nations
as a symbol of peace eternal the black-
out buster was reduced to a greasy mess
in 10 minutes when the factory caught
fire. It is to be hoped the candle’s fate
isn’t a symbol of that of the United
Nations.
Canada’s new High Commissioner, Mr.
C. Fraser Elliott, is enthusiastic over the
future of the oil industry in the
Dominion. He told a Sydney Millions
Club audience that a 1500-mile pipeline
from Alberta to Lake Superior would be
finished within 12 months, and that it
would be extended eventually right to
the eastern seaboard. Within three years
the Alberta fields would be in full pro-
duction: eventually their output would
exceed Persia’s.
Queensland Department of Lands pays
bonuses for dingo scalps. It is now
informing all authorised scalp-collectors
that it “desires to ascertain” during the
next year (a) the number of fully-grown
female scalps, ( b ) ditto male scalps and
(c) ditto pups. Underlined is the instruc-
tion :
For the purpose of the survey all dingo
scalps which are not scalps obtained from
pups are to be regarded as scalps of fully-
grown dingoes.
Any dingo caught trying to pass himself
off as a pup will be severely dealt with.
Although the A.L.P. decision to oppose
the Red referendum binds branches in all
States it is rather difficult to see the Vic-
torian and Westralian branches working
themselves to a shadow to win votes for
the “No” case. Vic. delegates went to
the meeting of the Federal executive with
instructions to urge acceptance of the
bill; those from the West favored sitting
on the fence and allowing their followers
to vote as they pleased.
“The Cheapest Electricity in the World”
runs a headline in the Communist
“Tribune” over an article extolling the
wonders of Dneiperstroi and other big
electric projects. Well, why shouldn’t it
be the cheapest? It’s produced by the
cheapest labor.
Conde, the Sydney blackout man,
wandering round America looking for
packages of kilowatts or something, was
discovered by the inevitable Yank with a
prahpasition and cabled his chief,
Minister Cahill, who thereupon
announced that a Liberty ship capable
of generating 20,000 kilowatts could be
bought for “over £1 million,” and could
be used to sail up and down the N.S.W.
coast unloading electricity wherever it
was wanted. Conde ought to be recalled
before he commits Sheahan to an option
on the New York subway.
Results of the 1950 floods in coastal
rivers are becoming apparent in ports
other than Newcastle (N.S.W.). It is
now claimed that Mackay is the only
Queensland port which has good depth
for ships, and that though State dredges
have scooped 3,000,000 tons of silt out
of ports like Cairns, Rockhampton,
Townsville, Gladstone, Bundaberg, Mary-
borough and even Brisbane itself,
moderately-sized laden vessels can’t berth
except at high tide.
Now that Dr. Evatt has become leader
of the Federal “Labor” party young Dr.
Burton has decided to confirm his “resig-
nation” from the Commonwealth public
service, and devote himself to his grazing
property near Canberra and “Labor”
politics. He thinks Reds are being un-
justly persecuted and are flourishing on
the injustice and the persecution. Well,
that clears up uncertainty in that quarter
—if there ever was any.
In South Australia in the first half of
this year 29 motor-cyclists were killed
and 380 injured. In Queensland the
figures for 12 months were 56 and 1182.
That is more than one death a week in
each State. Applying those figures to the
rest of the continent it seems that Aus-
tralia is losing more than 300 young
men a year through this cause alone.
What’s the use of cutting down the
infant-mortality rate if we allow the
youngsters to kill themselves off before
they’re properly grown-up?


MAGIC SEQUENCE.


Society
AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS
“Paul Pry”: A blitz in the Common-
wealth Public Service on late arrivals of
officers brought forth the usual stereo-
typed entries in the column provided in
attendance-books under the heading of
“Reason for late arrivals.” Most
common were: tram derailed, train late,
ferry held-up by fog, wife ill. Probably
the most truthful reason was that of the
bloke who recorded that he was “de-
ceived by the gloom of the morning.”
“Muskeen”: Pardon me for stooping
so low, but I must ask it. Was the name
of that kilted Italian bagpiper (B.
27/6/’5l) MacAroni?
* * * *
“Becks”; Adelaide is at present being
given the opportunity of inspecting a
telescope alleged to have been the
property of Captain Cook. The story is
that an antique-dealer bought it last
month from a woman whose family had
treasured it for more than 150 years—
since the time when its then owner, a
one-time shipmate of Cook, had left it
with them for repairs and failed to return
for it. It sounds likely enough and I
hope it’s true, but the main piece of
evidence adduced to prove the authen-
ticity of the instrument raises the demon
of doubt in my mind. The telescope is
said to be inscribed “Captain James
Cook, Endeavour, 1768.” It was in
1768 that Cook was given command of
Endeavour, but his rank was then
lieutenant. He was promoted commander
three years later, on his return from the
voyage on which he discovered the
eastern coast of Australia ; his captaincy
did not arrive until 1775. If that telescope
belonged to Cook, either the navigator
himself or the inscriber anticipated the
promotion by seven years.
* * * *
“Pip Tok”; A Perth woman parked
her car in a city street while she did a
morning’s shopping. This took longer
than she expected, so she wasn’t very
surprised on returning to the car to find
a note attached to the steering-wheel.
She smiled with relief when she saw a
schoolboy’s scrawl and read “Dear
Auntie, I bet you thought you had a
parking-ticket.” It was signed “Com-
missioner of Police,” after which in
brackets was the name of her favorite
nephew. But the smile faded when she
saw a postscript in a heavier hand—
“ Now you have got one” —over the
traffic-cop’s autograph. A parking-ticket
was attached.
* * * *
“Lord Luvus”: The centeenary-cent-
enary-centen-ary squabble which shat-
tered the peace of Melbourne a few years
ago looks like being rivalled by a new
rumpus over the latest commemorative
stamp, which bears the legend “100 Years
Responsible Government in Victoria,
1951.” But, argue the historians, this
year marks Victoria’s centenary of
“separation” from N.S.W., when the grog
flowed, the bonfires were lit and every-
body in the State thought the millennium
was round the corner. The centenary of
“responsible government” is still four
years off; it was in 1855 that the bi-
cameral system was introduced and
responsible government began. Even
the portrait on the stamp is a bloomer ;
it should not be of Governor La Trobe
but Victoria’s first Premier, William
Clark Haines. To add to the comedy of
misunderstanding and to confound
historians of the future, a wreath was
solemnly laid the other day on the grave
of Governor La Trobe at Polegate,
Sussex (Eng.), by the Victorian Agent-
General, and at the same time another
one was laid on William Haines’s grave
in Melbourne. Some cynics maintain it’s
a pother over nothing, anyway—Victoria
“ Please, cookie—not in the mixing dish!"
hasn’t had responsible government yet,
only irresponsible government.
* * * *
“Bo”: One of our suburb’s genialities,
he had pub-crawled in a vain attempt to
land a bottle of Scotch as a special offer-
ing for a valued guest—even the hostelry
wherein he sinks the nightly wassail
turned him down. Homing, heavy of
heart, he turned in to the local grocery
shop run by Guiseppe, who has a wine
licence, and sorrowfully ordered two
“Go on, get on with your digging — you're not at work now!"
bottles of the grape as the next-best thing,
mentioning casually as he did so his un-
successful quest. The Neapolitan’s eye-
brows shot up, his face opened, then he
dived beneath a counter and produced a
bottle of the best and handed it over.
His customer, astounded then delighted,
held it up. “But, Guiseppe,” he stam-
mered, “1 had no idea you kept Scotch !”
The beaming storekeeper waved a podgy
hand in a spacious gesture behind him.
“Of course I have-a da Scotch—dozens
of heem,” he exclaimed. “And lots of
da other foreign drinks, too!” No
wonder Caledonia is stern and wild.
* * * *
“Gumsucker”; Booze on polling-day?
When temperance raised its voice in
Ballarat 50 years ago and obtained a
poll on local option, it was decided that
a two-thirds majority for anti-booze
would mean the closing of 92 hotels, a
simple majority 48. Polling-day saw
every second pub turning on free beer.
Blue-ribboners retaliated with tea and
sandwiches, dispensed free in large
marquees. Result, both sides claiming a
moderate victory—4B hotels closed.
Later came whispers of “treachery” by
licencees of large, respectable hotels, sure
of being spared in the event of a
slaughter. These, it was alleged, bribed
hundreds of topers to vote local option,
on the principle that the fewer hotels left
the better for the survivors.
“G’roper”: Like Victoria, Westralia
keeps its pubs open on election-day;
unlike Victoria, it doesn’t believe in six
o’clock closing—beer is on sale till
9 p.m. Despite the longer hours there
seems to be no shortage of booze, yet
one never sees “pig-trough” drinking, as
in the eastern States. Perhaps it’s be-
cause the drink is easy to get. In the
early days on the goldfields no new hotel
opened without an all-day free house.
Were they rushed? Well, I’ve seen a new
licencee standing at the door of his
nearly-empty bar almost begging passers-
by to come in and have a drink on the
house. At the same time the other hotels
would be doing their normal trade.
* * * *
“Nakh”: Paris has provided a new
angle on the husband-wife-boyfriend
problem. M. Maurice Shaaf, the
husband, apparently didn’t mind his wife
bringing her lover into the house to live.
Unconsciously he may have. Con-
sciously he didn’t object to her boy-
friend, any more than Lord Hamilton
objected to Nelson, or the Marquis De
Chatelet to Voltaire, or Voltaire to the
gallant young M. De Saint-Lambert,
when that engaging gentleman trumped
him with his mistress, as he had her
husband. But there are always sub-
conscious elements in these affairs, and
they generally come out in some way or
other. When the broadminded M. Shaaf
saw his wife’s boyfriend philandering
with another women he shot him dead,
remarking that he could not bear to see
his wife jilted. So, although he doesn’t
seem to have considered that he had any
rights, he evidently thought his wife had.
He is now united with his wife in jail
awaiting trial,
* * * *
“Sixenate”: Tailors may have
abandoned the use of the guinea (B.
27/6/’5l), but lawyers, doctors, dentists
and other professionals stick to it; the
barrister whose brief was “marked” in
anything but guineas would regard the
act as an insult. I was talking to a legal
friend t’other day when his partner came
in about the costs of a client, evidently
waiting in his office. “Here’s the itemised
statement,” he said. “I was thinking of
making it 20 guineas.” My friend thought
it over, then grinned. “That makes a flat
£21,” he commented. “Looks as if we
were working in pounds. Better make it
21 guineas.” The client will never know
that legal squeamishness about the “pro-
fessional charge” cost him an extra
guinea.
* * * *
“8.J.L.”: In my business I have occa-
sion to drive two vehicles, one a 1950
utility, and the other a battered but
faithful old 1935 truck. When I’m in the
’5O model I can count upon a brotherly
salute and gracious nod from the well-
dressed drivers of gleaming sedans that
slip by. But should I meet an ancient
jalopy I can expect a ferocious glare, and
only about 40 per cent, of the road as
the crate snorts by, daring me to try out
my duco on its crumpled sides. But when
I’m bouncing along in the old truck, new
sedans flash by with frozen-faced drivers,
while the old jalopy king who cursed me
the previous day rattles by with a broad
grin, leaving two-thirds of the road open,
and giving an exuberant wave, often
accompanied by a ribald remark. On that
day I am one with him.
* * * *
“Shamuseen”: The tradition-demanded
pretence of reluctance to occupy the
Speaker’s chair (B. 20/6/’5l) has a
parallel in the manner in which the Torres
Straits binghi bridegroom is dragged to the
altar. Custom demands that through all
stages of courtship the dusky swain must
give all signs of reluctance to forfeit his
single blessedness and rigidly avoid the
unchaperoned company of his black be-
trothed, even to the extent of an osten-
tatious distaste for her person. Though
the custom springs from wowseristic con-
cepts of morality, it puts a strain on the
present-day sophisticated binghi belle,
who must be tempted to seek a more
gallant though less conventional beau.
♦ * * *
“Eve”: A lorry-man was taking a
sack of spuds into a city restaurant when
one small potato fell from the truck and
rolled into the gutter. Not a soul on the
crowded footpath glanced twice at the
big sack of potatoes on the man’s back;
all eyes were on the one loose spud in
the gutter. Nobody seemed game to
make the necessary move towards it;
convention says you mustn’t pick up
things from the gutter. Thank goodness
I’m no slave to convention-

A Rondo for Conductor and Orchestra.
“The N. S. Wales Chief Secretary, Mr. Olive Evatt,
said that he would favorably consider allowing the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra to hold an Art Union
to meet the expense of a visit to Edinburgh.”
Orchestra:
Goossens, our commander,
How can we wander
With music for the Festival, and music for the
Chamber ?
Mr. Eugene Goossens:
My friends, one answer seems to be
The conduct of a Lottery,
Which rules out me;
For, in a high, artistic fever,
I’ve conducted in my time
Many a feast of song and rhyme;
Many a symphony,
Many an opera,
And (with the timpani
Going pop-pop-era !)
Many a brisk Hungarian dance,
But never, never, never, never,
Never, oh, never a Game-of-Chance!
Orchestra :
Goossens, Goossens, ponder
How we may wander
With music for the Festival, and music for the
Chamber t
Mr. Goossens:
Many a fortune has been won
By people playing Vingt et Un,
But I, 1 hope, am famous for
Playing nothing but a score . . .
Yet stay!
My friends, I think I’ve found a way—•
For, in the State’s industrial communion,
Musicians must be counted an Art Union;
So hold yourselves, Art Unionists! You’ll soon
Fly off to Scotland like a bagpipe tune.
Orchestra:
Goossens, our commander,
Tell us what to squander
As prizes in the Lottery to, take us over yonder!
Mr. Goossens:
Offer to the hopeful Masses
’Cellos, violins and basses.
Clarinets and horns and drums,
Oboes and euphoniums,
And, as premier prize of all,
Offer Sydney’s old Town Hall—
Thus: “Refined Gent.’s City House,
All Mod. Cons, and Vacant Pos.” —
To the person or the coterie
Winning the Musicians’ Lottery.
Orchestra :
Goossens, Goossens, ponder!
Tell us; when we wander.
Won’t we need our instruments to play with,
over yonder ?
Mr. Goossens:
Nymphs and shepherds, come away!
Let us have a holiday!
There are other ways to play
Than to bang,
Scrape and blow
At some Scottish highbrow show!

No ! No! No !
Dance and sing
On the light fantastic toe!
Work go hang —
Let’s have our fling;
Youth’s but a season, and time’s on the wing!

“Driftsand”: The sports-oval at
Paskeville (S.A.), matted with coconut-
grass and high with weed, gives foot-
ballers the horrors when the rain pours
down and a gale chills through sleeve-
less guernseys; the match becomes an
endurance-test with no time out for
mirth. Yet I remember one game
(Australian Rules footy, of course) when
laughter won out. The forward pocket
was knee-high with grass where the ball
was booted for two men to tussle. They
fell and disappeared from view—ball and
all. One head bobbed-up, then another.
Then, as the players realised the ball was
missing, they disappeared again. The
roar from crowd and contestants alike
changed a bitter battle into a friendly
fight.
* ♦ * *
“Pawang”: Medical men have to take
risks sometimes which the public wots
not of. A country doctor was called up
in the middle of the night to attend a
woman who had taken an overdose of
phenobarb. When the doctor reached her
she was in extremis and he started to take
remedial measures; but the would-be
suicide refused to accept them. The local
constable was summoned. “If you force
her to take them things, doctor,” he said,
“you render yourself liable to a charge
of criminal assault —that’s the regulation.”
Knowing that unless something was done
his patient would be over the border in
a few minutes, the medico rang up the
nearest police-station and got the same
answer, so he phoned h.q. in the city.
“You’ll have to speak to the Commis-
sioner,” said the sergeant. “But he’ll have
to have an affidavit signed by you. That’s
the regulation.” “Well, put me on to
the Commissioner,” said the doctor.
“Sorry, he’s out,” said the sergeant. The
doctor took the risk and saved the
patient.

“Jasby”; At our suburban cinema the
latest version of “King Solomon’s Mines”
was approaching its climax, with Allan
Quatermain discovering the mortal re-
mains of his friend Curtis in a cave,
alongside a chest of jewels. All the
devices of technicolor had been drawn
upon to make the treasure look the real
thing. I’ve never seen jewels in the mass,
but the gleaming, sparkling heap of red,
blue, green and crystal pebbles certainly
looked convincing enough to me. The
youngster in the seat in front of me was
also impressed, “Whacko!” he shouted.
“Boiled lollies!”

“E-stroke-O”: Cruiser Mauritius, sent
to watch British interests at Abadan, had
an excellent record for gunnery and
general effectiveness during the war. Her
all-round efficiency manifested itself in
a friendly and helpful spirit towards
smaller units of the fleet, as more than
one R.A.N. corvette discovered. When
H.M.A.S. Burnie tied up to Mauritius in
the harbor at Tanga, East Africa, several
officers boarded the little ship to extend
offers of assistance. The padre announced
pictures that night and church in the
morning, the sports officer arranged
water-polo (Burnie won), the engine-
room department made available power
for lighting and ventilation, also work-
shop facilities. It was an inspiring and
heart-warming experience.
“Hey, do y ’ Want a pound of butter at the right price?”
“C.Q.”: The new blonde at the
analytical chemist’s laboratory put the
pie she had bought for lunch in the
laboratory oven. “Who on earth put that
there?” shouted the boss when he opened
the oven door. “I did,” said the assistant.
“Didn’t you know I put a dish of cyanide
above it?” he stuttered. “Would the pie
hurt it?” asked the lass.

“V. Cluse”: Back in my youth I read
“The Blue Lagoon” as a magazine serial.
: Twas then thought to be awfully daring,
though the author, H. De Vere
Stacpoole, handled the situation of the
boy and girl growing up together in
utter isolation on their island in a
manner that wouldn’t shock a modern
girls’ school. Not so long ago there was
a colored movie version of the story,
done quite well and with reasonable
respect for the original text. A week or
so ago I came across the book in a
second-hand book-store, and bought it
to see how it looked after 40 years.
Then I found something I’d forgotten.
After the children are lost, the girl’s
father begins a search for them and
finally locates an old salt who has read
his advertisement in the “Sidney
Bulletin” ; the author presumably believed
this to be the most likely medium to be
found in the South Seas at the time.

“Curate’s Egg”: I was surprised and
gratified when old McSnoozle, who
normally never so much as condescends
to pass the time of day with any of the
lesser denizens of our gentil bed-and-
breakfast joint, offered me a lift to the
city in his spanking new Super Superbia.
On the way in the succession of cheerful
grins from tratfic-cops, waves from pick-
and-shovel toilers, outright catcalls from
small boys and arch greetings from
“sure it's a lousy screw, but We should be cracking some child endowment
pretty smartly .”
drivers of other latest models, convinced
me that, far from being the old stinker
we had classified him, McS. had a legion
of friends in every level of society. It
was then that I noticed that he was not
returning the salutations which, indeed,
seemed to annoy or embarrass him to the
point of near-apoplexy. After he let me
out I saw on the back bumper-bar of his
limousine the reason for his seeming
popularity. This was a faintly pink pair
of what, some decades ago, the Press
used to describe as “feminine unmen-
tionables.” I then remembered that Miss
Tapkeys regularly hangs her laundry on
the window-sill of her bedroom, which
overlooks the spot where the Superbia
stands during breakfast-time. Miss T.,
understandably, remained reticent on her
loss, but next day old McS. quietly left
the embarrassing article on the back of
her chair at breakfast.

“Ek Bum”: Ray Whiting’s drawing
“Umbrellas will pot be worn” (B.
4/7/’5l) shows how deeply the canker
of formalism has eaten into military life.
In Wellington’s day, despite the brilliant
uniforms and parade-ground punctilio,
umbrellas were considered a normal
campaigning accessory by British officers
in the Peninsula, and the sight of a line
major riding down the road, gamp over-
head and batman contentedly padding
behind (also with umbrella) leading the
commissariat mule, would have failed to
astonish a Spaniard. Does not Jack
Fisher somewhere record the case of a
British admiral who went ashore under
fire on a Chinese river in mid-Victorian
days, a white belltopper on his crown and
a green-lined brolly as his armament?
Whiting’s joke would not have earned a
laugh in the days when Picton was killed
at Waterloo —according to legend, in
frockcoat and tophat.

“R. Volt”: The cable-station on
Cocos, Australia’s new colony, has always
been largely manned by Australians and
its victualling mainly done from our
shores. It was an Adelaide man, G. H. K.
La Nauze, who sent out the radio signal
which brought the first Sydney to the
atoll to destroy the Emden. One of the
company’s doctors was Professor Wood-
Jones, who married into Governor
Ross’s family and later became Professor
of Anatomy at Melbourne University ;
while on Cocos he modified Darwin’s
theory of the formation of coral islands.
Another Ross is chairman of the
C.5.1.R.0. in Melbourne.

“C. 8.”: Melbourne’s Parliament House
is a beautiful building, massively and
magnificently constructed, but the weight
of the wisdom of our legislators is gradu-
ally pushing the great sweep of the front
steps down into Bourke-street, and at
least £20,000 will be needed to make the
mighty doorstep safe for the official horde
to stand on to receive the King and
Queen next year. The building itself
also awaits completion. In the original
plan there was to be a mighty dome.
256 ft. high, and a wing extending over
what is now the members’ car park.
Today this work would cost at least
£400,000 —if stonemasons, carvers and
sculptors could be found in sufficient
numbers to do it. In 1854 the estimated
cost of the whole building was only
£250,000. It’s a sad commentary on our
modem progress that 20 years after
Batman’s arrival a building of such mag-
nitude could both be contemplated and
executed, yet today extensions or altera-
tions present a major problem.

“Villefair”: The pleasant - looking
woman alongside me at the grocer’s
counter asked for a millet-broom, and
was handed a rough-handled job at
14s. 3d. With a nod of resigned accept-
ance the lady went on: “And a
packet of cocoa, please.” The grocer
shook his head; “No cocoa.” With a
philosophical shrug the lady continued:
“A pound of brown sugar.” Again the
shake: “Sorry, no sugar at all.” “Half
a pound of ’ tea.” “No tea, madam.”
There was a familiar I-know-this-will-be-
futile expression on the woman’s face as
she asked: “Butter?” “No butter,” came
the reply, quicker than an echo. “In that
case,” said the lady, without a trace of
nastiness; “No butter, no broom.” She
made a swift pass and, with contented
smile and dignified mien, took her stately
exit —leaving the assistant presenting
arms with a millet-broom.
“Hoppy”: Our town is still in the
throes of the lead-bonus boom, with even
the most menial job remotely connected
with the mine bringing in 25 notes a
week. On a recent Sunday the teller of
the local bank, lying at rest on the en-
closed veranda at the rear of the premises,
was startled by an insistent knocking
upon the door. He
recognised the char-
acter standing several
feet from the door
as a client in the
medium credit-
balance class he
also noted the small
piece of paper held
aloft in forefinger
and thumb. Shortly
afterwards the client
and his cheque for
£5O retreated to-
wards the barracks, but not before the
non-participant in the bonus had issued
a statement on banking practice and over-
time. The request of the miner had been
a democratic one, “What about opening
up, mate? I’m a bit short and need a
few quid to stay in the swy game.”

“Spokeshave”; People who complain
of the lack of desire of the New Aus-
tralian to acquire a knowledge of English
aren’t always helpful when they meet a
struggling student. Armed with a phrase
which he had obviously just got out of
a textbook and had memorised, along
with the appropriate answer, a N.A.
breasted up to an acquaintance in a pub
and asked him how he felt. “Pallid, dis-
tasteful and obscene,” was the unexpected
answer. It is 40 years since I last heard
the phrase, from the lips of a cable-
operator in the tropics at 4 a.m. How
it has managed to remain in circulation
so long I’m blessed if I know.

“O. C. Cabot”: The time, January,
1894 ; place, the south Indian Ocean about
44 S. and 52 E. Our barque River
Ganges had been becalmed for three
days 1000 miles from anywhere, with 2000
fathoms of water under her keel, with her
heavy yards canted at all angles against
the rolling of the ship, for although
the sea was glassy a heavy swell played
with the vessel and made everything
aboard creak, clatter and complain. All
hands, from the Old Man, Captain
William Budge, to the cook, were
whistling for a wind, but on the fourth
day the calm still held. Then the mate,
Neil Anderson, decided it was time to
act. He went down below and came up
with a handful of pennies and ha’pennies.
He stepped to the starboard rail, just aft
of the wheel, telling the idle helmsman
and those of us within earshot to
“whistle like hell and keep whistling.’
Then raising his hand, still jingling the
coins, he half-said, half-sang:
Go to the witch,
Go, make her rich,
Send us a wind, you blasted old bitch!
With the last words he flung the coins
into the sea. The mate then resumed his
pacing up and down. As he passed me,
he said “Now, young fellow, we’ll get it
tonight.” And believe it or not, that
night up came the great sou -westerly,
and for the next 10 days the old barque
was thrusting her way towards Fremantle
under reefed canvas and mighty htt e
that.
HARD TO BEAT.
“The heart is the most popular subject in every
kind of poetry of every nation. In the last 40 years
there have been 3950 musical pieces in which the
magic word ‘heart’ occurs.”— World’s News.
’Twas some primeval caveman, not a doubt,
Of outsize muscle and of hairy chest,
Who gained his light-o’-love by waddy-clout
(A form of wooing, this, which most im-
pressed),
And then, with feelings tender —nay, devout —
A strong poetic urge he sought to test,
Recording in first print her wondrous glamor
By chipping rock-face with a crude stone hammer.
It followed, then, naturally enough,
Another caveman, passing, read the jingle.
Although the scansion and the rhymes were
rough
The rock-hewn love-lines set his blood a-tingle.
It being ecstatic and impassioned stuff
(He’d be no benedict, you bet, but single),
He bought it then; the price: one brontosaurus.
Later he set it to a verse-and-chorus.
Corollary to that is easy guess:
He “flogged it” to the world’s first publisher.
The song was an immediate success,
He-men coughed up for it without demur.
Reward he had for his sagaciousness—
That publisher became much wealthier.
Just as today, the one who got the lighter
Wad from the arrangement was the writer.
Since then the heart has been accounted “tops”
As theme for any poem or for song;
In Homer and in Virgil up it crops.
It never did—nor will it —get the “gong.”
Verses on birds and flowers are likely flops;
A song of battle never sells for long.
But nothing piles the £ s. d. up quicker
Than pomes and songs about the human ticker.
You might think songs about the liver would
Be popular. Strangely, this isn’t so;
And none that touched on gall or gullet could
Financial windfall possibly bestow.
Intestines for a song-theme aren’t so good;
As money-spinners lungs are rather low.
Would poet, whether from Oslo, Rome or
Sydney,
Wax lyrical about his loved one’s kidney?
Whether it “sings upon a blithesome note,”
Or in the depths of dull despair is cast;
Or, with the wildest hope, “beats in the throat,”
The blood-pump as an organ’s unsurpassed.
It keeps the good old boodle-ship afloat.
Small wonder that its influence is vast,
That bards and Tin Pan Alley thus should tackle
Right joyfully the subject cardiacal.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Yal”: Joe’s wedding had two high-
lights that will keep the district talking
until the next baby show at least. As
the ceremony was reaching the crucial
“wilt thou” stage some dogs began to
fight outside the church, whereupon the
bride turned around to the bridesmaid
and said: “Janie, get a stick and knock
them dawgs ’eads off!” And Joe’s reply
to the chief toast at the reception in the
Mechanics’ Hall will surely be the basis
of much argument at the pub as to the
possibility of there ever having been a
briefer flight of oratory, for, after much
prodding by the bride, he had stood up
clutching a glass, gulped loudly once,
said “Here’s hoping” and flopped back
into his chair
*'* * *
“Speck”: As a member of Captain
P. G. Taylor’s crew on his survey flight
to South America, I had the experience
of seeing an Australian sheep-station
in one of the most remote spots in the
world—Easter Island. Alighting on a
"... An what's more, HE can argue with your
missus all day!”
heavy sea off that inhospitable-looking
shoreline, we were prepared for anything,
but didn’t expect to see a sunburned
Aussie grazier in the first boat out to
greet us. His roar of welcome dispelled
any doubts in our tired minds (we had
flown all through the night), and Jack
Ford introduced himself. He manages a
30,000-acre station, running two sheep
to the acre. When I mentioned the wool
boom at home and asked him why he did
not return he roared with laughter:
“What, to that madhouse of strikes,
blackouts and nine - pound - a - day
shearers? Never. I lack nothing. Labor
is cheap and I live like a king. The only
thing I miss is my daily paper and my
weekly ‘Bully.’ ” We set course for Val-
paraiso that evening, farewelled by our
compatriot and his beautiful Chilean
wife.

“Old-timer”: The plains were sheeted
in rain and all the flat land lay under
a carpet of yellow water. Baldy Harris
and Tom Mitchell, the latter at the wheel,
sat in the cabin of the big prime-mover
as it towed the eight-wheeled trailer and
10 tons of wool through the slush. Visi-
bility was about a quarter-mile and
Mitchell sat hunched over the wheel,
peering through the half-moon of glass
kept clear by the wiper, listening to the
song of the diesel, his only guide to the
track hidden under the yellow water
being his instinct. Baldy was half-asleep
when he felt the outfit stop and stirred
himself to look at Mitchell. “Got me
tricked,” the driver confessed. “We
should ha’ bin at the Beloeth turn-off be
this, but a man wouldn’t know the damn’
thing if he saw it in this weather.” Baldy
defrosted the screen with a sweat-rag and
peered forth at the rain. “Me, too,” he
said. “Man could be in the middle o’ the
flamin’ ocean for all he’d know. Hullo,
here’s somebody.” An oilskinned horse-
man loomed through the rain, his head
down, his horse ambling with spread feet
through the greasy slush. “Hey,” Mitchell
called, “are we pointin’ right for Hay?”
The horse stopped, the rider looked up
and a burst of vitriolic profanity smote
the truckles’ ears. They listened in
astonished admiration till there came a
pause and Mitchell called “What’s wrong
with you ?” “Strike me flamin’ pink an’
ruddy green,” howled the rider. “I
thought y’ was Wooloondool homestead
an’ now I’ve rid six miles outer me
flamin’ way an’ you’re only a crimson
wool-truck. Go an’ get work!” And
he pulled the horse round and jabbed it
into a fast canter into the deluge. “Soon
as we get this load off,” Baldy said
bitterly, “I’m back t’ Sydney drivin’ a
bus. Y’ can follow the flamin’ tramlines
when it’s rainin’ there, an’ if the pas-
sengers go crook y’ can answer ’em back
before they ride away on a flamin’
horse! ”

“Amdee”: A storm that had risen in
the ranges overnight was flickering its
life away Barrier Reef-wards. As our
boat chugged steadily towards the coast
the rays of the rising sun were reflected
from thousands of thread-like streamers
4ft. to sft. long floating in the air at
varying heights. These gossamer threads,
flashing with rainbow tints, greatly mag-
nified and beautified, proved to be aerial
vehicles for tiny greenish-yellow spiders
of pin - head size.
They clung to one
end of the thread, to
be wafted away from
the jungle-clad ranges,
where atmospheric
conditions suitable for
air travel coincided
with their hatching.
Nature’s haphazard
but effective method
of keeping Barrier
Reef islands infested
with bloated, loath-
some black - and -
yellow spiders.

“Elgey”: The first
Yanks ever to arrive
at Mount Garnet
(N.Q.) were 250 of
the Signal Corps,
fresh off the boat in
Cairns, heading up
the overland telegraph
line for the tip of
Cape York peninsula.
They had never set
foot in our bush
before. They bom-
barded Len Lucey, the
local bushlore
authority, on where
would they find the
“kangerews and emoos in the brush.”
“Oh, there are mobs out in the
forest country a mile or two out
where you jokers are camping,”
said Len. “Say, sir, what about
your game laws?” “Well, shoot as
many ’roos as you like, but don’t knock
over any emus.” A few days later the
captain’s jeep-driver pulled up outside
Lucey’s hotel. “Say, buddy, we seen a
kangerew yesd’y mawn, he come
bouncin’ up to th’ camp. Sergeant he
rushed into his tent an’ got a tahmy-
gahn an’ giv’m coupler bursts.” “Did
he get it?” asked Len. “Naw,” replied
the Yank. “Muster missed, for it jes’
kep’ right on bouncin’!”

“Chuck”; Long accustomed to com-
plaints in the dailies describing grey-
hounds as “ferocious” and “savage,” I
decided the dozen or so I’ve owned at
“Would you explain again how you work this pressure-cooker?"
different times must have been excep-
tions. Perhaps only the highly-trained
coursing animals were vicious. Then I
bought for farm work a couple of the
species from city kennels —great hand-
some animals, whose papers told of good
breeding and promising performances.
Obediently the pair climbed after me into
the truck, and if there’s any ferociousness
in those mild-mannered animals I’ve yet
to find it. With a fight on among my
assorted pack, I feel sure of two dogs
that won’t be in it, and the smallest pup
round the place—a Border not long off
his mother —snarls the great hounds into
their places and pinches their tucker.
Maybe it’s their size that is disconcerting
to the more timid ; or perhaps some are
deliberately taught to be savage; but
more likely it is just a few bad ones
among the tribe that have given a tough
reputation to the greyhound family.
Occasionally savage animals will be found
in almost any breed, from poms to grey-
hounds, even the friendly clan of sheep-
dogs or foxies sometimes yielding a line
of sneaking specimens that are un-
doubtedly vicious.

“Sack”; Sool ’em “Old-timer,” I’m on
your side (B. 20/6/’51)! But the type of
cocky I’m savage with is the coot who’ll
work his kids into the ground while he
himself does less work than a long-nailed
Chinese mandarin. Back in ’39 when
you could get dairyhands to work 72
hours a week for £2 10s. and keep, I came
in contact with a girl of 10 years and
nine months who had been worked into
a complete breakdown. A doctor had
ordered her to have 12 months’ rest
“where she will never even see a cow.”
For years the kid had been getting up
early, milking 20-odd cows, cleaning and
washing-up, then going off to school;
at night, of course, there was the same
routine to go through again. Her aunt,
who was nursing her back to health, told
me naively: “It has made things hard
for her father, but Old Granny insisted
on carrying out the doctor’s orders. The
other girl is nine ; she milks twenty cows,
so she can’t do Dot’s, too. There is a boy
five; his father was going to teach him
to milk, but Gran won’t have it; she
reckons he’s too young yet. I really don’t
know how they’ll manage to keep going.”
“How many does the father milk?” I
asked. “Oh, he doesn’t get time to do
any milking,” came the amazing answer.
“He’s a shire councillor and all his time
is taken-up in going around looking at
the roads and that.”
* * * *
“Old Camp”: Here’s one old-timer’s
version of the Kanowna “sacred nugget”
(B. 13/6/’5l). In August, 1898,
Kanowna was at the peak of its boom.
Tom Doyle, publican, possessed of a rich
Irish humor; Father Long, in his
mid-twenties, fresh out from the
Sod, was enamored of the romance
of the world’s richest goldfield.
Often when returned from a long cycle
among the scattered members of his flock
he would drop into Doyle’s for a cool
pot, over which the imaginative Tom
would regale hip with tales of nuggets,
huge and of virgin gold. Often the young
priest expressed a wish to see “just one
real big nugget.” So Toni, loving a
practical joke, determined to gratify him.
He and a couple of cronies cast a big
nugget of lead: the mark of a boot heel
drawn in a crescent in the sand gave the
mould that named the resultant “nugget”
“The Sickle.” A coat of gold paint did
the rest. Then with the “nugget” in a
chaffbag the two alleged diggers took it
down to the rectory. Viewing the
“nugget” as it lay in the bottom of the
bag, feeling its weight, the young priest
naturally thought it was genuine. A
pledge of secrecy was then exacted from
him: for Tom Doyle well knew what
would happen should the story of such a
monster nugget get around. For a time
Father Long kept silent. Then one day,
standing with a crowd viewing a big slug
in a shop-window, he indiscreetly re-
marked that he had not long ago seen a
much bigger nugget. “Where?” became
the universal inquiry. Pressed on all
sides, the young priest appealed 1© the
supposed finders, who, not daring to
admit to playing a joke on the Cloth,
gave as the locality a spot some six miles
out of town. How a crowd of some
6000 diggers assembled on August 11 to
hear Father Long make his pronounce-
ment from the balcony of a hotel: how
there followed one of the wildest “rushes”
in Australia’s history: how not one
speck of gold was found, has been written
of dozens of times. Legend has even
grown that the unhappy priest became
so worn with the episode as to waste to
an early death. He did die not long
afterwards, but of typhoid fever.
* * * *
“Kali”: Rabbit-traps might account
for some one-legged seagulls (B.
13/6/’5l), but barracouta and eels are
responsible for the great majority of these
bird cripples. The eel is the worst
offender; his close-fitting teeth can
easily and quickly grind off the seabird’s
legs, the bird’s frantic efforts to escape
only helping the amputation. The barra-
couta, which has teeth primarily intended
for ripping, finds it difficult to bite the
leg off cleanly. Often the gull is dragged
under by the narrow-gutted fellow and
drowned.
♦
“Old Crab”: During branding at the
Old Dip yards one of the calves took to
the scrub. Mick, the big dog, was sent in
pursuit, but the branding was finished,
the calves let loose and the big gate shut
by the time the prodigal mooched back
with the patient Mick at her heels. The
dog got her to the gate, saw it was locked
and held her there, but when he saw the
boss wouldn’t budge he bowled the
poddy over and dragged her under the
gate into the yard, where the boss was
boiling the quart.
SONG FOR A CYCLIST.
City boy, city boy,
Get on your motor-bike.
Ride it faster
On the face of the moon.
Down the ice mountains,
Faster, faster.
Your wheels make fountains
Of shattered icicles,
They spray in the night air
Like little moons shining,
And your wheels make planets
That will never stop spinning.
Your breath is lost now
In the white, white wind.
But what does it matter
If you lose what you find?
What does it matter
If your exhaust is a loud flame;
If the wheels falter?
It’s almost a game.
Go faster, faster
Down the dark of the moon.
Louder, louder,
You’ll get there soon.
And when you arrive there,
No need to understand
That the moon’s at your feet
And the sun’s in your band.
But with a boy-king’s dßceptance
And awkward grace
Simply receive the warmth
Of the fire on your face.
O brave boy, brave boy!
Your mother need never cry.
Need never stoop with your weight,
For if you look death in the face, boy,
You nfeed never die.

“Bo”: The mob admitted that the little
Maltese in the timber-camp had had a
“stiff trot” in the poker-school. If he
sat on three deuces and picked a pair
of “butchers” he’d find someone sitting
over him with a full on nines. If he
bought the middle-pin of an ace-high
straight he’d stack-up against someone
holding a flush. It was enough, they
conceded, to make any Maltese cross.
Not surprising, then, in view of his super-
heated Mediterranean gore, when his
only royalty of the night, four sixes,
found Johnny holding two pairs of tens

“Naturala”: Tell “Bass” (B. 13/6/’5l)
that although he is deserving of sympathy
as being afflicted by the presence on his
estate of what is known in the W.A.
south-west as a “moaner,” it is a frog,
there being no toads in Australia. A toad
is squat in shape, with a rough skin
covered with warts, which are capable
of exuding an acrid semi-poisonous
fluid; it also is non-vocal. Numbers of
Australian frogs are amphibious, but they
are all smooth-skinned.

“Mat’s Mate”: With no dough and no
tucker we were doing a shiver in the
Victorian western district when we
sighted a hamlet and headed for it. We
passed a farm-gate bearing the legend
“Wattle Grove, J. McUngwin,” and Mat
commented something about people who
advertised. There was one pub in that
village and Mat headed for it. In the
bar he said “I’m Gallard. McUngwin
leave anything here for me?” The
publican eyed him and asked “You mean
Jack McUngwin, from Wattle Grove?”
“Yair.” “No, he ain’t bin in today.”
Mat brooded ; I stood by. “Where’s y’r
telephone?” was Mat’s next query. “In
there.” I followed Mat into a small room
off the bar. Mat whirled the handle, left
the receiver on the hook, mumbled some-
thing, then loudly said “Yes. It’s me,
Gallard. That cheque ain’t here.” Pause.
Then, “Well, y’ said y’d leave it an’ me
an’ the mate’s out o’ dough. What!
Four o’clock! Gripes, we’ll be dead o’
starvation be then. Oh, all right, I
s’pose if we gotter wait, we gotter.”
Then we walked out through the bar,
Mat saying “Well, wouldn’t it domino
you! He’s full o’ apologies, o’ course,
“It’s a case of love-at-first-sight!”
but we gotter go hungry till” But by
that time the publican had us by the arm
and was leading us to the dining-room.
An hour later we weren’t there.

“V.”: Don’t agree that “Old-timer’s”
N. Casey (B. 6/6/’5l) could ride like
“Banjo’s” selection. The man from
Snowy River was a bloke by the name of
Johnny O’Reilly, He entered this district
in his youth, when, before my advent, he
rode up this flat of mine, leading a spare
nag. Both excellent animals, they were
at that time his sole possessions. He
looked the district over and settled in the
Groggin country near the foot of
Kosciusko, and made a living there,
running cattle on the bush-slopes.
Yes, Johnny could ride. The rugged
slopes breed ’em like that, and, though
Johnny inspired “Banjo” to verse, and
Jim Culhane of Crooked River was also
renowned as one of Australia’s best, this
mountainous region has produced horse-
men of class whose name is legion—
among them men like Dick Rawson and
Jack and Paddy McNamara, who, though
never in verse, are still well remembered
here: men who have lived out their
lives on the cattle-runs of the snow-clad
alps, where none but the experienced
horse and bushman could safely enter,
but where the initiated vanished, to re-
appear ant-like on the home slopes many
days later with a handful of lost stock
or a few captured brumbies. There are
still youngsters who delight in wild and
wilder steers or bullocks to sit on, and
older stockmen who can race a horse
down a bad side with superb skill and
balance, but they are fewer nowadays.
“Betcha”; Stan was digging out the
last few burrows in his paddock, his
three dogs grouped alongside. Presently,
on the small flat to the left, a rabbit
appeared, and Stan dropped his mattock.
“Trey!” he hissed, jerking a small
whippet into action. “After him, Trey!
As the whippet took off Stan raised a
warning hand at the other two dogs,
then grabbed one by the collar and held
him till the whippet brought back the
rabbit. The digging was resumed. Then
out from another opening of the burrow
shot a rabbit, which made for the heavy
slopes on the right. “Zac!” snapped Stan
urgently. “Sool ’im, Zac!” A greyhound-
whippet cross went into action, and
again Stan laid a hand on the other dogs,
checking their eagerness. The rabbit
dodged in a patch of rocks, and as the
pursuit lost ground Stan loosed his
clutch on the big greyhound. “Deener! ’
he barked. “Get him, old boy! ’ A few
minutes and the dogs returned, the big
hound proudly carrying the rabbit.
“What’s the idea, sending ’em in relays/
I inquired. Stan spat on his hands and
picked up the mattock again. “No good
wastin’ ’em,” he grunted. “Silly to let every
mong you’ve got run after every easy rab-
bit. ’Bout a dozen runs an’ the lot of ’em’s
knocked up. Tm tryin’ t’ train mine
different from other blokes, that’s all.
* * * *
“K.”: “Elegy’s” story of how the
farmer caught the big groper (B. 27/6/’5l)
reminds me of the old-timer down Berma-
gui (N.S.W.) way who described a day’s
shark-fishing. “Uncle loaded up the dray
with his gear, a stout rope, a length of
heavy chain at one end and an iron hook,
made by the blacksmith, on the end of
the chain. Two of us boys rode with
him and he took along half a dozen
blacks to get the bait —said bait being one
of his ancient steers which we killed and
cut up near the beach in the bay over
there. Then he fixed a big hunk of steer
on the hook, put an airtight small drum
at the junction of rope and chain, and,
loading the lot into a boat, we rowed
out into the bay and burleyed the area
with the steer’s innards ; then dropped
the hook and line overboard. Ashore
again, uncle sat and smoked till the empty
drum started violent aquatic tumblings,
whereupon he hitched the horse to the
end of the line and hauled the whole box
of tricks ashore, including a 10ft. shark
on the hook. Even we boys didn’t think
much of it as fishing.”
PONY.
All aboard for bareback rides,
All on a shaggy pony—
Skimpy behinds and knees all bony,
Dangling legs in a row.
Bandages slipping on shin and toe,
Cuts and thorny scratches;
Bites of apples and lumps in jaws,
Cracks on lips, small, dirty paws,
Seats of pants with patches:
Podgy and round each little belly
Shaking inside like half-set jelly,
Dusty toes in the hairy sides —
All aboard for bareback rides,
All on a shaggy pony!

This 67-year-old station-supply, produce,
carrying, agency and general merchan-
dising business, with headquarters in
Melbourne, operates in the back country
in Victoria and N. S. Wales, where there
are 26 and 19 branches respectively, with
another in S. Aus. Since the war share-
holders have been in clover. For the
most part the story has been one of fair
to good seasons, accompanied by the
greatest boom in commodity prices that
the country has ever known (especially
for pastoral and agricultural products)
and scarcity of supplies. At the same
time the board has followed a policy of
expansion by absorption and otherwise.
Over the last eight years expanding
turnover —the figure rose from £lf
million in 1944 to over £5 million last
term, when the improvement exceeded
£500,000 —has more than taken care of
advancing costs, enabling net earnings to
climb from £17,617 to £113,718, and the
div. to be lifted from 7 p.c. to 12 p.c.,
the average for the eight years being
approximately 9.9 p.c. Also £225,000 of
fresh capital was gathered, and it brought
with it £93,625 of share premiums, which
were added to reserves, and which make
the average div. worth only 6.9 p.c. on
the fresh capital. The last lot of scrip
(£110,000) was put out at a premium of
ss. a share in Nov., 1949, and no time
was lost in finding profitable employment
for the money, and a lot more besides.
After allowing a generous £37,150 (up
£15,090) for depreciation and a liberal
£lOO,OOO (up £48,000) for taxation, last
term’s declared net earnings were £39,012
stronger at a record £113,718. That was
26.7 p.c. on capital as against 22.4, 20.7,
19.3, 18.7, 16.3, 15.5 and 8.8 p.c. back
to 1944. A 2 p.c. bonus was added to the
10 p.c. div., making 12 p.c. for the year,
and £20,000 was whisked away to inner
reserves as provision for doubtful debts,
making the total thus set aside over the
last seven years £62,389.
Continued expansion is the feature of
balance-sheet figures:

The year’s net addition of £70,680 to
premises and plant partly reflects
purchase of warehouse premises at South
Melbourne for £41,000 (of which £30,000
has been written off) and of a small busi-
ness at Euroa (Vic.). To do this, carry
an extra £133,684 of stocks and an addi-
tional £177,795 of book debts the amount
coming to the co.’s bankers and other
creditors was increased by £243,398. Ex-
cluding tax provision, there was 235. sd.
of outside money in the business for every
pound belonging to shareholders when
the books closed.
To lighten the debt, provide for further
expansion and at the same time guard
against being caught with a top-heavy
capital structure when conditions change,
the co. is issuing £lOO,OOO of 4\ p.c. un-
registered notes with a six-eight-year
currency. Also, shareholders are to be
offered 75,000 new £1 shares at a premium
of 10s. each, one for six. Both issues
have been underwritten. Since last term’s
profit was equal to 14.7 p.c. on share-
holders’ funds (capital and reserves com-
bined), the new notes should be very
helpful to shareholders.
At 58s. 9d. the net price of the shares
(after exercising the rights to the new
issue and allowing for brokerage) is 555.,
at which figure the return was 4.4 p.c. on
a 12 p.c. div. basis. Net tangible cover
(including the new issue) is 355. Id.,

From a well-equipped factory at Lid-
combe, near Sydney, this 23-year-old
turns out knitted swim-suits, trunks and
cardigans as well as woven shorts, shirts
and skirts. It has £208,333 of capital to
feed in 35,000 9 p.c. first and 100,000
5 p.c. second prefs. and 73,333 ords. The
Australian public put up the pref. money,
the last £lO,OOO, carrying 9 p.c. div., plus
£5OOO of share premiums, was gathered
during the 12 months covered by the
latest accounts. The American parent
co. holds most of the ords., in which
Burns Philp is also interested.
Post-war inflation and the spread of
spending power, together with increased
output and a vigorous advertising cam-
paign, pushed sales, etc., up from
£206,112 in 1946 to £1,053,037 last term,
when the improvement was £231,214. The
contraction of £5148 in declared net earn-
ings was due entirely to larger provision
for taxation (£55,000, up £25,800),
generous allowance being made for an
anticipated increase in the rate of co. tax
for 1950-51. However, the £41,412 of
profit was enough to pay the pref. divs.
(£7789) and show an attractive 45.8 p.c.
on ord. capital as against 53.6, 29.4, 19.5
and 14.4 p.c. back to 1947. The div.,
steady at 9 p.c. for the 12 preceding
years, was lifted to l\\ p.c., leaving more
to plough back into the business than
was distributed.
Of each pound of last term’s income,
materials, manufacturing and distribution
took 12s. Hid,, wages, salaries, etc., ss.
lid., and taxes Is. 2d., leaving 9d. for
shareholders, of which sid. was retained
to promote further growth of the busi-
ness and 3id. was paid to shareholders
in dividends. The figures make nonsense
of the doctrinal exuberance of Socialists
and Communists who preach that share-
holders are potential malefactors who
might break out against the national in-
terest at any moment. Unlike wage- and
some salary-earners, shareholders have
been quite inadequately recompensed for
the rise in the cost of living, and, at the
same time, they have had to bear a pro-
portionately heavier burden of taxation.
Not only are company profits heavily
taxed before distribution, but they are
again subject to levy as dividends in the
hands of shareholders. The purchasing
power of dividends and, therefore, their
influence upon the inflationary spiral has
progressively declined over the last
decade.
The co.’s financial position improved,
the growth in the more-or-less liquid sur-
plus (£205,829) was £22,728:

Reserves subject to £42,393 of goodwill at 30/4/’5l.
The leap of £35,415 in last term’s record
profit came from the earnings of sub-
sidiaries, which accounted for about 63
p.c. of the total as against 35 p.c. in the
previous term. The parent, which makes
biscuits, cakes and plum-puddings,
earned less profit (£36,335, down £4649),
due to rising costs, shortage of labor and
lower output, which resulted from the
rationing of gas, the co.’s chief baking
fuel. An auxiliary gas plant, installed
toward the close of the year, helped to
reduce the production loss.
The Ice Cream subsidiary, which has
been a regular dividend-payer for some
time, had a “most successful year” and
sent along an unstated but “substantial”
dividend. A dividend (amount unstated)
was also received from C. D. Haywood
Pty., Ltd., biscuit manufacturers, of
Hobart, the whole of whose issued share
capital was bought during the year. The
parent’s holding in subsidiaries (now
£121,782) increased by £93,775, and a
goodwill item of £42,393 showed up in
the consolidated accounts. There is an-
other small offshoot which turns out
dehydrated fruit and vegetables, but it
has never been much of a help.
There was an increase of £137,724 in
combined gross earnings of parent and
subsidiaries:

Net .. £65,910 £60,377 £62,475 £97,890
* Includes provision for depreciation and taxation.
An encouraging feature is that exes., in-
cluding provision for depreciation
(£36,397, up £6028) and taxation (£56,687,
up £18,280) made off with 78.6 p.c. of
gross earnings as against 80.5 p.c. in the
previous year. The £97,890 of profit was
a juicy 32.6 p.c. on capital as against
20.8, 20.1, 21.9, 21.8, 17.8 and 13.3 p.c.
back to 1945. So nothing had to be
strained when the cautious board lifted
the distribution from an all-round 8 p.c.
to 10 p.c., of which 3 p.c, is labelled
bonus—the £300,000 of capital includes
£lOO,OOO of 8 p.c. prefs., which advance
with the ords. beyond that rate. More
than twice the amount distributed was
put on the shelf, lifting reserves to
£433,729, subject to the goodwill item
already mentioned. Shareholders’ net
tangible funds (capital and reserves com-
bined, less goodwill) need turn in only
4.3 p.c. to cover 10 p.c. on capital alone.
For many years the board made very
generous allowances for depreciation,
strengthened plant —only modem equip-
ment has any value in the books today—
and built up large cash reserves, thus
greatly improving the co.’s financial and
trading position:

of the Hobart business, which, together
with rising prices, accounts for most of
the movements in the rest of the balance-
sheet figures.
The future level of earnings will depend
largely upon the struggle between turn-
over and costs. The market notes the
co.’s strong position, including the wide
margin between earnings and distribu-
tions, and prices the 30s. ords. paid to
20s. each at 545. 2d. (41s. 6d. a year
ago), giving a return of 3.7 p.c. on a
10 p.c. div. basis. The investor who looks
for 4.4 p.c. on his money counts on a
12 p.c. div. There has been no recent
sale of the prefs., which usually bring
around the same figure as the ords. Net
tangible cover is £6 18s. 3d. prefs. and

Inflation, which in this case means
rapidly-rising costs against a background
of fixed corpus and other commission
charges, has robbed scrip of these trustee
cos. of some of its former attractiveness
as an investment. And, without an in-

isn’t likely to change much until costs,
largely wages and salaries, cease to gobble
the gains from a steadily-expanding
volume of business.
Elder’s, which has a paid capital of
£90,000 backed by £86,073 of reserves,
has been a steady 10 p.c, proposition
for the last 32 years. During the last 10
of them the volume of trusts on the
books increased by £6,701,489 net, reach-
ing £20,660,237. Over the same period
gross earnings rose by 79 p.c. and costs
by 110 p.c., and the 1951 profit was
£lOOO less than the 1941 figure.
Last term £2,443,948 of new business
was entrusted to the co.’s expert care.
This exceeded the value of estates wound
up by £1,390,433, which augurs well for
future earnings:

estates handled are engaged.
But costs (up £7003) won the
race by £399. The £12,458 of
profit was 13.8 p.c. on capital
as against 14.2, 14.6, 14.2, 13.7
and 12.4 p.c. back to 1946. On
shareholders’ funds (capital and
reserves combined) the year’s
profit was a wink over 7 p.c.,
whereas these funds need turn
in only 5.1 p.c. to cover 10 p.c.
on capital alone. Still, after
paying the div., writing £528 off
the book-value of equipment
and sending £2614 to the staff
fund, only £316 remained for
reserves.
Inflation is the co.’s head-
ache in other directions, too. As
trustee it must not only follow
the directions of the trust deed,
but at the same time strive to
preserve the capital and provide
a reasonable income for the
beneficiary. This is virtually
impossible with economic con-
ditions and the law as they are,
unless the testatoj includes a
clause in his will giving the
trustee power to invest over a
wider field than is provided by
the list of legally authorised
trustee securities. These consist
mainly of low-interest-bearing
Government and certain public-
body loans and first mortgages.
While beneficiaries with pastoral
and agricultural interests have
benefited from the commodity
booms, life-tenants dependent
upon income from authorised
investments are experiencing
considerabl hardship. What is
needed is an overhaul of trustee
legislation by the States giving
trustees wider powers under the
“prudent man” rule.
The market for the co.’s pound
shares paid to 5s. each has
changed little over the last 12
months. At 14s. 3d. the yield is
3.5 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis,
and, at the moment, it is difficult
to say when better can be
expected. Net tangible cover is
9s. 9d. per share.
Wana
“Lemon” : Australasian
Petroleum’s Wana test-well (B.
24/5/’50) stopped at a depth
of 9866ft. without encountering
oil. There are, however, com-
pensatory factors. Most im-
portant is the striking of a thick
limestone bed of sufficient
porosity and permeability to
produce salt water at the rate
of 18,000 barrels a day, together
with a small amount of gas.
Another is that drilling in the
Delta area has been less trouble-
some than in the more easterly
parts of Papua. Still, these facts
do little more than justify the
cost of further drilling in the
Delta, unless further favorable
conditions are revealed. Data
from Wana have enhanced the
prospects at Omati, but have
little significance for Hohoro
and practically none at all for
structures further east.
Geophysical investigations sug-
gest that the Wana location was
on a structural high. In any
case the now geologically better-
known physical characteristics
of the stratigraphical column
of the Delta will enable geo-
physicists to interpret their
readings with far less uncertainty
than before the Wana well was
drilled. Further work may lead
to a much fuller conception of
the Delta structure at depth, and
may also allow of an approxi-
mate determination of the ex-
tent of the porous limestone
body penetrated in the Wana
bore.
To this end, and following
on a visit of Australasian
Petroleum’s general manager
(Mr. Pym) and the chief geolo-
gist (Mr. Osborne) to London,
the number of seismic parties in
active operation around Wana
is to be increased to three —only
one party was working there up
till October last. This should
mean an extension of geophysi-
cal investigations over a greater
area, and allow of the location
of another test-site, yet to be
definitely determined.
There is the possibility that
distribution of commercial de-
posits of petroleum—if such
exist—underlying the Delta may
be controlled by factors other
than structure. This can be
proved or disproved only by
drilling more wells. From any
point of view the discovery of
the first sizeable porous and
permeable bed within the
Papuan “oil-belt” is a matter for
congratulation; but the Stock
Exchange should not misinter-
pret its significance as extending
beyond the limits of the Delta
Division.
King Island Scheelite, which
has contracts with U.S. (seven
years) and U.K. (five years) for
sale of concentrates (terms un-
disclosed), is stepping up its
treatment figures and winning
handsome profits. For 36 weeks
to June 30 last 126,077 tons ore
were milled for 614 tons con-
centrates valued at £1,000,871,
and shareholders received an in-
terim div. of 60 pkC. on June
22. Assay value of the ore and
concentrates is not mentioned,
nor are operating costs. It was
the high price of wolfram that
sent revenue rocketing. London
average for five months to end
May last was equal to over
£A33 per unit. Co.’s f.-p. 5s.

One of the best known landmarks in the city
of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, is the statue
erected in Hannan Street, to commemorate
the discovery of gold by Patrick Hannan in 1893.
The subsequent development of a group of
extraordinarily rich gold mines made Kalgoorlie
world famous and earned for the district the
title of “The Golden Mile”.
Firmly established in Australia well before
the first discoveries of gold, the Bank of
Australasia has continued to develop its service
until today, the bank has nearly 400 Branches
and agencies, providing a comprehensive
banking service throughout Australia and New
Zealand, and in Fiji.

Glen Davis
“Petro”: The proposal, spon-
sored by Senator Spooner, that
part of the Glen Davis (N.S.W.)
plant should be dismantled and
removed to a more accessible
site for use in refining of crude
petroleum is more realistic than
Dr. Evatt’s plea for continuance
of this uneconomic venture
which has cost the taxpayer
close on £5 million and has
hindered rather than helped
national and defence projects.
If that sum had been spent on
additional storage and refining
facilities at the seaboard it
would have gone a long way to-
wards bringing Australia’s petrol
security up to the desired level.
The whole position might have
been different had the Commo
dictators among the shaleminers
allowed output of the plant to
be doubled, by permitting
miners to do a day’s work for
a day’s pay. Even then the plant
would still have been uneco-
nomic.
It must not be thought, how-
ever, that transfer of those por-
tions of the Glen Davis refinery
which are worth dismantling
will be easy or inexpensive. No
item in the section between the
mine and the, crude shale-oil
tanks has a breakdown value
approaching the cost of sal-
vage. But the refinery does in-
clude a two-coil Dubbs unit and
a U.O.P. polymeriser, which,
though rather out-dated, are still
useable. Whether their remain-
ing effective life will justify the
cost of dismantling, transport
and re-erection and the building
of ancillary equipment is very
questionable. One not-neglig-
ible item will be the strengthen-
ing or reconstruction of the
bridges along the route, as had
to be done when the heavier sec-
tions of the plant were first
imported.
The claim by Mr. Beale
in the N.S.W. Parliament on
June 27 that 16 to 17 million
gallons of petrol (six times the
output of Glen Davis) would be
produced annually by the same
units re-erected at Bell Bay
(Tas.) is not likely to be realised ;
and it is improbable that the
advantage of obtaining the 8000
tons of petroleum coke per
annum required for aluminium
production, near the point of
output, will anything like offset
the overall high cost of running
the transplanted refinery.
Mr. Beale’s claim that petrol
produced at Bell Bay will cost
2s. a gallon—high in compari-
son with commercial costs in
Australia —instead of 4s. at
Glen Davis, can represent only
the net cost of production. Pub-
lished figures prove that the
overall dead loss incurred in
running the Glen Davis plant
amounted to about 4s. for each
gallon of petrol produced, and
that the overall cost of each
gallon of petrol marketed was
very much higher.
The statement by Mr. Holt,
also on June 27, that the residual
gases, piped from Bell Bay to
the aluminium plant, would save
20,000 tons of coal a year, and
would reduce the price of
aluminium ingot by about £5 a
ton, suggests faulty slide-rule
manipulation. The “vital de-
fence commodity” which it is
expected that a British co. will
make in the partly-dismantled
Glen Davis plant is now stated
to be carbon-black. Altogether,
the Glen Davis white elephant
would still appear to require
very expensive maintenance.
Hanro (Aust.) Knitting Mills
Registered in Victoria in
November, 1932, this well-known
manufacturer of high-class
knitted goods did not become a
public concern until January this
year, after which 50,000 £1 ords.
were issued at par in order to
finance business expansion and
reduce the overdraft.
The co. had its beginnings in
Bendigo. A proprietary was
formed in 1926 to take over the
business of Bendigo Knitting
“Miss Tapper—has that damn' wart gone yet ?”
Mills, which had been estab-
lished by H. F. Longstaff in 1920.
The Hanro trade-mark, which
was originated by the Swiss firm
of Handschin and Ronus, camC
through an association with Mr.
Handschin dating from 1926,
when he became governing-
director of the proprietary. A
number of Swiss operatives were
brought out on a three-year con-
tract, and they trained local
factory-workers in the manufac-
ture of knitted underwear.
Mr. Handschin returned to
Switzerland in 1930, but the
Swiss interests have retained a
substantial shareholding in the
company. The factory is at
Hargreaves-street, Bendigo, and
it covers about 52,000 square
feet. Decentralisation has meant
that the co. has had satisfactory
labor supplies. There are sales-
offices in Melbourne and Sydney.
Present paid capital is £193,332
in 15,000 8-10 p.c. cum. par.
prefs. and 178,332 £1 ords., all
fully paid.
Profits for 1946 were equal to
3.6 p.c. on present ord. capital,
allowing for prefs. For 1947
the figure was 4.1 p.c., 1948
3.6 p.c., 1949 4.8 p.c., and 1950
8.2 p.c. (figures are to July 31
each year).
The board has stated that
these profits figures were the
maximum amounts permitted
under price-control in relation to
the funds then employed. It
adds that “the percentage of net
profit during that period in rela-
tion to paid-up capital was satis-
factory, but now that the amount
of funds employed in the busi-
ness has been increased the com-
pany will be permitted to earn
substantially higher profits.”
Sales for the year to July 31,
1946, were £157,288 ; 1947,
£180,066 ; 1948, £194,537 ; 1949,
£236,005; 1950, £361,935. For
the first four months of the
current financial year they were
£119,391 —an increase of £25,332
on the comparative figure for
1950.
Since July, 1950, fixed assets
have been revalued and written
up by £108,222. Out of this
assets-revaluation reserve a
bonus issue of 64,166 ordinaries
has been made.
The audited net profit for the
four months to Nov.* 30 last was
£10,259, subject to taxation.
Under these conditions “the
directors anticipate that there
should be no difficulty in paying
a dividend at the rate of at least
6 p.c. p.a. on the ordinary
shares.”
Balance-sheet figures adjusted
to illustrate the effect of recent
capital alterations, etc., show
buildings, plant, etc., at £161,041,
stocks at £125,032, debtors at
£28,725, cash, etc., £10,509, and
goodwill and preliminaries,
£12,925. Liabilities, including
provision for tax and dividends,
amounted to £73,185.
The sharemarket has given the
co.’s scrip a cordial reception.
The price last week was 275. 6d.
At that figure the yield would be
4 p.c. on a 6 p.c. div. basis. The
backing amounts to 265. 7d. per
ord. share in net tangibles on
book values.
To meet still-growing demand,
the big Dunlop Rubber group —
parent and eight subsidiaries
which together operate 17 fac-
tories throughout Australia—is
to further increase manufactur-
ing capacity, which will also
mean more stocks and more
book debts. To provide finan-
cial elbow-room, nominal capi-
tal has just been doubled by
creation of 6,000,000 new £1
shares. Subject to consent of the
Capital Control Board, some of
these are to be offered at a date
and upon terms yet to be an-
nounced. In June, 1950, co.
borrowed £1,250,000 on p.c.
debentures from the A.M.P., and
four months later it issued
941,414 new £1 ords., one for
four, at a premium of 10s. each.
Paid capital is now £5,678,069
in 930,000 10 p.c. prefs. and
4,748,069 ords. At 51s. (475. a
couple of months ago) a one for
two new issue at 50 p.c. premium
would make the net price, after
exercising the rights, 435. 7d.
The return at 435. 7d. would be
3.6 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div., which
was the rate paid for the last
four years, with wide margins.

U.K.-Dominion Wool Dis-
posals (the Joint Organisation)
has just auctioned in London the
final 12,500 bales of the 10£ mil-
lion surplus bales of Dominion
wool accumulated during the
war. It was originally estimated
that the task would take between
12 and 13 years, but so great has
been the demand for wool since
the war that the entire surplus
has been sold in less than half
that time. J.O.’s trading profits
for the five years to June 30,
1950, amounted to £8125,740,864,
and total profits to
£8153,576,023. Exhaustion of
these surplus wool stocks
means that manufacturers
will now have to rely entirely
upon current seasonal produc-
tion to meet their requirements.
Formation of a new organisation
for the purpose of establishing a
minimum or floor price for wool
is now under discussion between
Dominion growers and Govern-
ments.

obliging summer.
The turnstiles at the South
Bank Exhibition and the Festival
Pleasure Gardens continue daily
to register their substantial
totals. So also, do those at the
long-established seasonal events,
such as the Wimbledon tennis
championships and the Test
against the South Africans at
Lord’s. The latter terminated
abruptly, but not without satis-
faction to a nation that has be-
come a hardened, if a good,
loser. Faces beamed the more
when the reputedly-staid M.C.C.
made history by giving the form
of a happy-go-lucky “friendly”
after the Test was won; the
general feeling is that no harm
will be done if international
cricket loses some of its grim
seriousness.
Unhappily, the great national
events of this season have
opened in conspicuous shadow
by the enforced absence of King
George. The sense of void is
inescapable. His Majesty opened
the Festival of Britain and the
South Bank Exhibition and was
noticed to look strained and far
from well. There can be no
doubt that both the ardour of his
duties and his unsparing con-
scientiousness have set him back,
particularly as some of his late
public appearances were made in
bad weather.
Of late his engagements have
been shared by her Majesty
the Queen, the Royal Princesses
and H.R.H. the Duke of Glou-
cester. Great concern is felt
that Princess Elizabeth, whose
duties must necessarily be heavier
than those of her uncle and
sister, might also become over-
taxed. The announcement that
H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh
is being released from his naval
commitments has been warmly
welcomed.
Bevan Looks Ahead
Signs that the Labor party’s
Left-wingers are busying them-
selves with repairing constituency
fences and looking to the im-
mediate future have been much
evident of late. Both Mr.
Dalton and Mr. Strachey have
turned aside from Cabinet duties
to reassure the faithful. Mr.
Dalton has launched an attack
on a double front against “too
great” profits and the allegedly
wide gulf between rich and poor.
Mr. Strachey’s approach was less
hackneyed and also less explicit.
Speaking from the same plat-
form as Mr. Bevan, who may
be regarded as a co-belligerent
if hardly an ally, Mr. Strachey
advocated the “principles of
gradualism” to be applied “not
by socialising completely a small
part of the economy, but by in-
fusing an element of socialisation
into the economy as a whole” —
not, as it were, a stiff drink but
a compensatory cup of tea with
a dash of rum in it.
Two lesser figures, Col. Wigg
(one of the co-authors of Keep-
ing Left ) and that didactic in-
tellectual, Mr. R. H. S. Cross-
man, have both used the Persian
crisis as a means of anti-
American expressionism.
Mr. Aneurin Sevan’s plan of
campaign is different. The
future he has in mind is not so
much the next election as the
one after that. On the assump-
tion that the nation goes to the
polls in October, a Labor defeat
, seems inevitable. Mr. Bevan
probably thinks that a Conserva-
tive Government would decline
in influence and popularity with
the years and be badly defeated
at the end of its term, five years
later. He would then still be on
the right side of 60, open and
ready for the highest office.
With 24 other M.Ps., including
his three-four regular henchmen,
two resigned Cabinet Ministers
and a score of quasi-Bevanites,
he is shortly to publish a state-
ment of his policy. Details are
not known, but the nature of
this statement will undoubtedly
be in the form of all-out sociali-
sation.
The chief danger before him
is that he might cause an overt
split in the party, which could
mean obloquy and political ruin.
So he has to choose a dangerous
course, close to a high and un-
accountable wind, and trust to
his navigational skill. That is
to say, if he can keep on plotting
and scheming and marshalling
his forces without provoking an
open rift, he hopes to derive so
much power from “below” that
he must embarrass the party-
leaders “above” into a forced
coalition in which his own influ-
ence would be considerable.
One question needs an answer:
Would any section of the nation,
save his own clique, stand for
Bevan as Prime Minister?
Old Vic Changes
All seems to be well at the
Old Vic now that differences
have been settled and future
policy decided on. It is gener-
ally acknowledged that a good
deal of tact, restraint and gentle-
manly forbearance has saved
what might easily have developed
into a national scandal. Three
out of four of its artistic direc-
tors —Messrs. Michel St. Denis,
Glen Byam Shaw and George
Devine —resigned en bloc, after
murmurs of clashes with the
management, and were soon fol-
lowed by 15 of the teaching
staff of the Theatre School at
Dulwich. Then the administra-
tor, Mr. Llewellyn Rees, himself
resigned.
In bringing back Mr. Tyrone
Guthrie the governors took the
only possible action. It is un-
likely that anyone else could tide
the Old Vic over the three chief
dangers before it; to quieten
the murmurs of discord, to hold
the balance between artists and
management (or, the same thing,
between theatre folk and non-
theatre folk), and to take care
of the future. Now that the
prospect (not by any means
unanimously voiced) of a
National Theatre for Britain
grows dimmer, it is reassuring
that the theatre which has every
claim in its own right to fulfil
that purpose is strong enough
and, as it were, man enough to
surmount disagreement without,
pettiness.
The future policy is well-
defined and should be as effec-
tive as it is simple. To house
two first-class companies side-
by-side will give great service to
drama generally. While one
plays in London the other will
be free to tour, not only in the
neglected provinces, but also in
the Commonwealth. Moreover,
the direction, in the joint care of
Tyrone Guthrie and Hugh Hunt,
is not likely to become self-
centred or individualistic, since
provision is made for guest actors
and producers.
If any proof of the Vic’s
artistic integrity is needed, the
current “Henry V” should
assuage the most searching of
critics. Glen Byam Shaw’s pro-
duction was acclaimed, without
misdirected applause, at the fall
of the curtain by both audience
and cast. His achievement is a
double one; psychologically, he
has succeeded in making a war-
play acceptable to an audience
that refuses to be moved by
priggishness and jingoism ; and,
technically, his simulation of
large armies is natural and
effective. The company, headed
by Alec Clunes (a reverend,
mature, noble and reasonable
King Harry) gives near-flawless
support. Which is only to say
that what matters most to the
artists, past or present, is the
Vic itself.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
The late-afternoon party given by the
Consul-General for U.S., S. J. Fletcher,
and Mrs. Fletcher to celebrate the
Glorious Fourth was well up to expecta-
tions, but there was an underlying tinge
of regret, for it is the last Fourth of
July party the popular diplomat and his
wife will give in this city—in September
the Fletchers leave for America; Mr.
Fletcher is retiring from the Consular
service. The entrance-hall and drawing-
room of the South Yarra residence were
decorated in flowers which carried out
the patriotic motif. Mrs, Fletcher
received her guests wearing a black
taffeta frock, the skirt draped to one side
and caught on the hipline with a large
bow. Among the guests were Mr. and
Mrs. T. T. Hollway, she in a suit of
cherry-red wool and a small matching
hat and shoes. Madame Lui, wife of
the Chinese Consul, wore over her
national costume of black chenille velvet
silver-fox furs. Lady Collins, who was with
her husband, chose dove-grey ensemble
and matching cloche. A wide-brimmed
ruby velvet hat was worn by Mrs.
Garnet Carroll with her black suit. Mrs.
George Jones, wife of Air-Marshal Jones,
wore a rust-red-shot tie-silk suit and
black hat. Mrs. Hamilton Sleigh’s gun-
metal satin frock was contrasted with a
white feather cloche. Mrs. Daryl Lindsay
was in black-and-blue-striped tie-silk and
small black pillbox hat. Mrs. D. S. Mac-
Kinnon, of Skipton, contrasted her
cinnamon-brown frock with the sage-
green ostrich plume in her small hat.
Mrs. Paddy Moran had three tiny birds
set in the crown of the small black hat
she wore with her black frock.
Climax to the Fourth of July celebra-
tions was the magnificent Kentucky
Derby Ball at the Town Hall, organised
by the American Women’s Auxiliary to
the Children’s Hospital. The inspired
scheme of decorations brought a steady
stream of compliments for the women
responsible. Branches of spring blossom,
both real and hand-made, were set in
banks of greenery in the foyer, where
there was also a huge raceboard, setting
out names of horses and owners and
indicating their table-numbers. In the
main hall a series of backdrops on the
stage gave a wonderful three-dimensional
impression of grandstands, track and
lawns at Churchill Downs, Kentucky,
where the Derby is run. The stage was
flanked by many flowering trees and
shrubs. Gay pennants, cleverly wired to
give a waving effect, hung from the bal-
conies, and on each table large horse-
shoes filled with American Beauty roses
formed the decorative note. The roses
were to match those traditionally pre-
sented to winners of the famous classic.
Novel programmes in leather covers the
shape of a jockey’s boot contained the
history of the Kentucky Derby, the words
of “The Star Spangled Banner” and “My
Old Kentucky Home,” which were sung
during the evening.
Mrs. Earl Daum, president of the
auxiliary, received the official guests, who
included Sir John and Lady Latham (the
latter is president of the Children’s Hos-
pital), and the secretary of the hospital,
Howard Barrett, and Mrs. Barrett. Mrs.
Damn’s bouffant strapless gown was of
flame-colored tulle. Mrs. H. Bettle wore
a blue mink cape over her tulle gown of
multi-colored panels which ranged from
cocoa-brown to off-white. A blue mink
stole covered Mrs. A. G. Silk’s slim-
fitting black frock, the strapless bodice of
which was heavily encrusted with gold-
bead embroidery, A bouffant gown of
beige net with a wide ruffle outlining the
strapless bodice was worn by Mrs. Adrian
Perry, Pale-pink and gold beads embel-
lished the pale-blue satin gown worn by
Mrs. A. E. Hotchkiss. Mrs. Ivor Caro-
lan’s misty-blue-and-pink moonstone-
embroidered frock was of tulle. Mrs.
Douglas Bowden’s jade-green tulles had
a wide band of white-bead embroidery
outlining the off-the-shoulder bodice.
Wanda Shilliday had an upstanding cuff
edging the strapless bodice of her slim-
fitting gown and full overskirt of orchid-
pink faille.
Melbourne Grammar School Chapel
was the setting for the wedding of Valma
Eunice, only daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
J. A. Rickard, of Merbein, and Anthony
Austin, only son of Mrs. W. T. J. Scott,
of Eildon, Lismore, and the late Brigadier
G. A. Street. The bride’s lovely gown of
cream French tulle fell softly over
Duchesse satin and was finished with a
Belgian point-lace cape-collar. Gar-
denias caught her finger-tip tulle em-
broidered veil, and her bouquet was
fashioned of the same fragrant flowers.
The bridesmaid, Kirsten Pallman, wore a
blossom-pink tulle frock with a matching
stole and Juliet cap. The ’groom’s
brother Greg was best man. Reception
was at the Menzies.
Mrs. Scantlebury, wife of Dr. G. C.
Scantlebury, has been appointed junior
vice-chairman of the National Council of
the Australian Red Cross in place of Mrs.
T. W. White, just left for England with
her husband and family; Mr. White will
be High Commissioner for Australia in
London. Mrs. Scantlebury’s service with
the Red Cross dates back to the First
World War ; with Mrs. White she worked
in London at the Red Cross inquiry-
bureau for Australian servicemen. Dur-
ing the last war she was deputy divisional
commandant, Victorian division, and
honorary director of the inquiry-bureau
for wounded, missing and p.-0.-w. Mrs,
Scantlebury has been a member of the
divisional council of Victoria for many
years and is chairman of the Council of
the Victorian branch.
Country visitors remaining in town for
a few days after the Grand National
racing celebrations are over will be sure
of a grand night’s entertainment if they
go to the Navy League Ball on July 19
at Earl’s Court, St. Kilda. The Governor,
Sir Dallas Brooks, and Lady Brooks, with
members of their personal suite will be
met by a guard of honor composed of
Navy League Sea Scouts. Other official
guests will be Admiral Sir John and Lady
Collins and Commodore and Mrs. H.
Buchanan. The official enclosure will
take the form of a ship’s bridge, and on
the Governor’s table will be a floral light-
house, complete with revolving lights and
flanked with anchors. Trails of ivy
coming from a centre-piece consisting of
a small white flower-pot holding a colored
candle and a flower-banked base, will be
on the smaller tables. Tickets may be
obtained from Mrs. C. Alsop (US 161),
Mrs. lan Potter (Win. 2134), and Mrs.
C. F. H. Green (U 9014).
This is Ruth Ockenden, a third-year
Mus. Bac. student who is playing a big
part in the Melbourne Children’s Theatre
of the University Conservatorium Drama
School. Each programme is presented
for four Saturdays and the season is to
last for six months. Ruth has written the
music for many of the plays, and is
interested in drama. Three years ago
she came to Australia from England,
where she was a student at Queen Anne’s
School, Caversham, Reading.
Decoration motif for the luncheon
organised by the Australian-American
Association in the Lower Town Hall in
honor of Independence Day were the
golden eagles and the flags of both coun-
tries. Mrs. R. G. A. Jackson (Barbara
Ward) made a particularly fine speech
on the importance of understanding and
good fellowship between the British Com-
monwealth and the U.S.A. Smartly
turned-out in a black-and-grey bird’s-eye-
tweed suit and tiny black velvet hat, the
guest-speaker was accompanied by her
husband, Commander Jackson. Sir
Herbert Gepp, who was chairman at the
luncheon, announced that Sir John
Latham has consented to be the presi-
dent of the association. Ladies in the
official party included Lady Lowe, Lady
Dixon, Mrs. S, J. Fletcher, Mrs. H.
Beetle and Mrs. S. F. Rowell.
Wintry weather brought out a galaxy
of furs and coats for the Grand National
at Flemington, and head-hugging hats
kept out the biting wind. Most popular
color-choice was yellow, which went from
primrose to the deep-amber tones. Ger-
anium-red, robin, holly, pillar-box and
peony were worn by many, while the
deeper wine tones also had their devotees.
Top coats in bold-check tweeds were well
in the lead. Mrs. F. Fleming’s barrel-
coat in navy had a wide shawl collar
and turn-back lapels down the skirt of
the coat in navy-and-white checks.
From Sydney
Art shows and national-day celebra-
tions seem to have occupied most of
people’s attention during the week.
There has been quite a crush at the
National Gallery’s Jubilee shows,
especially on Sundays, which the opti-
mists attribute to an increased interest
in art among Sydney people. The cyni-
cal, however, think it shows an increased
distaste for Sydney’s weather. The
National Gallery has always been a
refuge for Domain visitors when it rains.
The Americans celebrated the Fourth
of July with many parties and dances,
and the Philippines Independence Day
(which is also the 4th) was kept up by
a party at the home of Dr. and Mrs.
Regala. The beautiful national costume
of the Philippines, with its stiffened
butterfly-leaves, was a feature of the
dressing. The colored lights in the garden
and the gay company made it a very
happy gathering. Among the guests were
Lady Lloyd Jones, Sir Angus and Lady
Gillan, Mrs. K. Coles, Mrs, Pierre Mann
and the Erik Langkers.
Pretty Rhondda Baker (in the picture)
will play the part of Mary Collitt in the
Mosman Musical Society’s production of
“Collitt’s Inn” which opens on the 20th
of this month, Rhondda will be remem-
bered for her performance as Lady
Shayne in the M.M.S. “Bitter Sweet” pro-
duction, and she has also had experience
as understudy to the leading girl in
“Annie Get Your Gun.” She plans to go
to England next year to study radio and
stage work further. She is also interested
in television, a field in which her appear-
ance and talents should bring her great
success later.
The party given by the C. M. Crofts
(he is Commercial Counseller for Canada)
at, the Pickwick early in the week was in
honor of the National Day of Canada
and also so that Sydney could meet
the new High Commissioner and
Mrs, C. Fraser Elliott, who maintained
the reputation for friendly charm held
generally by the Canadian community
here. Elizabeth Northcott was there, also
the Lady Mayoress. Practically the whole
of the consular people seemed to be
present, including Madame Vrisakis, Mrs.
Donald Smith, Madam Wang and Madam
Regala. Among the Canadians were Mr.
and Mrs. Roy Miller with daughters Mrs.
Bruce Rankin and Joyce. Also sighted
were the Roy McMorrans, Mr. W. Rob-
son, Mr and Mrs. Hudson Fysh, the
Frank Clunes and Mrs. Jean Scott.
Canadian caviare was among the savories
served, but was passed over by some of
the Australian guests, who mistook it for
apricot jelly. It’s quite different from the
dark granular Russian caviare, but has a
somewhat similar flavor.
One would have expected that natives
of “blizzardly cold Canada” would find
Sydney weather quite tropical, but Mrs.
Fraser Elliott, Mrs. Croft and Mrs.
Rankin all told “the Press girls” at an
afternoon-tea given by Mrs. Elliott
that they almost froze to death in Aus-
tralian houses and could never get
enough central-heating. “Outside, the
weather’s beautiful,” they said; “but
inside, it’s petrifying.” In Canada, one
wears silk dresses even in the winter,
covering them up with woollens, fur
coats, snow boots, etc., all of which are
divested when one comes into the house.
Mr. and Mrs. Elliott have left for a tour
of Queensland, and hope to get at least a
glimpse of the rest of Australia before
they settle down in Canberra.
The Royal Art Society’s Jubilee Year
Exhibition at Anthony Hordern’s Gallery
was opened by the Minister for Educa-
tion, who was accompanied by Mrs.
Heffron, looking very chic in black. The
Royal Art Society celebrated the Jubilee
year of Federation, although it was quite
grown-up itself when Australia as a
nation was born, and is now 71 years
old. Looking at the paintings from a
purely feminine angle, one couldn’t help
noticing how much the fashion in faces
has changed over the years. Women in
the past seem to have had very much
more face (though not cheek) than they
have today, more hair, larger eyes, fuller
lips. Since the late ’twenties brought in
the cadaverous look the very formation
of faces seems to have changed, so that
high cheekbones and narrow faces are
the beautiful and ordinary. Perhaps
it’s all done by cosmetics and illusion,
but it seems strange that so many of the
large-faced beauties have disappeared.
During Franquin’s performance on his
first night at the Empire a girl in the
front row drew his attention to her friend
who had gone to sleep. “Never mind,”
said the Great Franquin, “she’s not
missing much.” After the show, however,
theatre-manager Chris Bohrsmann went
down to see why a small group of people
were still gathered in the theatre and
found that they were trying to wake the
still-slumbering woman. He snapped his
fingers at her in the Franquin manner
several times but to no avail, and eventu-
ally had to get the hypnotist to come out
and wake her up so that she and her
friend could go home.
By the way, how many people know
the difference between hypnotism and
mesmerism? It seems that when you’re
hypnotised you go into a deep sleep and
later don’t remember anything you’ve
done, while when mesmerised you’re quite
conscious but you can’t help doing what
the mesmerist tells you (provided, of
course, it’s something you don’t really
want to do).
The Metropolitan Theatre put on
“Happy as Larry,” an Irish fantasy in
verse by Donagh McDonagh on Friday
night an ambitious venture for
amateurs as far as stagecraft is concerned
—and made a very good job of it. Elaine
Haxton’s painted screens were delightful,
and they seemed to fold and unfold
with an efficiency seldom seen in “little
theatre” circles. There is an irresistible
atmosphere of youthfulness about the
Metropolitan players, courageous and
vital. Only youth, it seems to this Letter,
could so unselfconsciously handle
“Happy as Larry,” a play which makes
comedy on tfie theme of death (only an
Irishman, too, could have written it). If
one wanted to he carping at all in the
face of such lightheartedness, one could
say that the diction was not good enough
for a verse-play, which, more than any-
thing else, needs to be very clearly
spoken.
Described as “a combat of the sexes,”
the A.B.C. feature “We Beg to Differ”
has a formula rather like that of the
Brains Trust, but the subjects to be dis-
cussed are very much less weighty.
Samples are “Why do men never put
the cap back on a tube of toothpaste?”
and “Why do women prefer gallantry
and flowers to a sensible household
kettle?” Of course men will say that the
first subject is absurd and that it is the
women who leave the toothpaste tube un-
capped. They’d probably prefer to have
the little matter cleared up why women
never provide enough ash-trays in the
house, nor buy sufficiently large ones.
Women will want to find out why men
purloin all the matches in the house, not
to mention the nail-files and the small
combs. Maybe these bones of conten-
tion will come up during the six pro-
grammes to be featured, starting July 19.
Waterside workers have nothing on
babysitters for high-handedness. The
other night a young couple wondered
why their babysitter (a university student
who lived a few blocks away) hadn’t
turned up an hour after he’d agreed to
come. When the husband went round to
find out why, the young man said “Oh, I
was quite ready, but I expected you to
call for me in the car.” Those of us who
find getting to work under our own steam
rather a fag would do better to take up
this new, well-paid and anything-but-
onerous job.
The “Night in Cairo” Ball, to be held at
Prince’s on August 13 by the senior com-
mittee of the Anti-T.B. Association, is to
be strange, exotic, mystic, wonderful.
The atmosphere of ancient Egypt is to be
recaptured in the decor, waiters’ costumes
and general entertainment, but the floor-
show does include a tango and there are
to be one or two touches of modern
Cairo which people who have been there
won’t have any difficulty in recognising.
Official guests invited to the “Carac-
tacus” Jubilee concert of the Royal Phil-
harmonic Society on Saturday night in-
cluded Lieut.-General and Mrs. Berryman,
Archbishop O’Brien, the Minister for
Education, Sir John and Lady Butters,
Sir Charles and Lady Lloyd Jones and
Lady McNicoll.

Lately of 8.C.0.F., Japan, Alan
Moorhouse Charlesworth becomes Air-
Officer Commanding, Southern Area—he
had for years been in a similar post in
Eastern Area. Transferring to the
R.A.A.F. after a year in the Army, he
learnt the necessary at Point Cook, helped
an R.A.F. party in a photographic survey
of Somaliland, then bumped round in
Ansons till, in 1939, he temporarily folded
his wings, S.A.S.O. of Central, later
Eastern, Area. His first love was the
Navy, which he tried to join with school-
mate Harold Gatty—they knocked him
back for a “bent back.” The affliction
handicapped him so much that he only
managed to be champion athlete for three
successive years at Duntroon ; also won
the Sword of Honor for outstanding
student of his year. Promotion to Air-
Vice-Marshal goes with the new appoint-
ment.
Thorold Grant gets the presidency of
the S. Australian limb of the B.M.A. A
graduate of Adelaide University, he had
some years in the London and St.
Batholomew’s hospitals before coming
back to Adelaide, to work mainly among
children. Pathology’s his pet.
“Macnell”: Rodney Rhoades, alias, of
course, Dusty, who added his captain’s
ring last week, spent the first of his 28
R.A.N.-years in British battleships—it
was his only time in the big boys. A
fathom or so of rangy casualness,
possessed of the verve and unhurried
efficiency characteristic of destroyer
captains, he was in destroyer Vampire
in 1939, and shortly afterwards went to
Vendetta, in command. When Italy de-
livered its stab in the back she was refit-
ting in Malta, helpless under the first
bombs, but she soon showed her
termagant nature once she got away. Fox-
-19 violent months Rhoades drove her old
and valiant length through the Mediter-
ranean, supporting Wavell, bombarding
Bardia, hammering an Itie submarine to
the bottom, evacuating Greece (350
troops in one night without the
loss of a man); on the Tobruk spud-run,
in seven weeks landing 4000 men and 650
tons of ammo and supplies, steaming, in
one year of Rhoades’s captaincy, over
100,000 miles. He came out of the Med.
with D.S.C. and a “mention,” to stand-
by the building of, and later to captain,
destroyer Quickmatch, a young cruiser
compared to Vendetta. Next command
was frigate Shoalhaven, in 1946 (later of
Korean service). At the moment
Rhoades, 42, is still with his high-
powered midgets—boss of the Royal
Navy’s Nore Destroyer Flotilla,
Visiting Melbourne from Maoriland,
Jack Stannage, who was Smithy’s radio-
operator, and helped to find his chief
when he was lost in n.-w. Australia. He
was in the Southern Cross, too, when the
engines failed and P. G. Taylor crawled
out on a wing to make the epic oil-
change. John travelled to Melbourne on
the first Tasman Empire Airways flight
from Christchurch and found it painfully
uneventful. He is manager of 3ZB
Christchurch.
Some of these New Australians
make good. Berta Angar, born
in Vienna, came to Melbourne shortly
before World War II broke. Eight
years later she qualified at Mel-
bourne University with honors in
surgery and medicine and also won the
Ryan scholarship in surgery. She has
just been appointed assistant medical
superintendent of Royal Melbourne, the
first woman to hold the job. So do some
Old ones. The examinations for the
coveted award of the Licence de Concert
were held recently in Paris and candidates
from most of Europe, from the Americas
and South Africa competed. The only
candidate to qualify was also the only
Australian in the contest —Maxwell
Cooke, the brilliant young Melbourne
pianist who for the past two years has
been studying under Alfred Cortot.
Landed in Australia last week, Douglas
Hartree, Professor of Mathematical
Physics at Cambridge and the brain
behind the mechanical brain. He designed
and installed the first differential analyser
in England—for further information on
this beastie see the C.5.1.R.0., for whom
the prof, is lecturing. Away from his
valves and lights and wires, producing
answers in the flick of an eye from astro-
nomical equations, he’s normal enough to
play music and tennis, and to delight in
model trains.
“G. Elburg”: Deputy-leader A. R.
(Bert) Hawke, who steps up into Frank
Wise’s place as leader of Westralia’s
Labor Opposition, is one of the best
debaters on his side of the House, a
hard hitter with the saving grace of
humor. Hawke, who migrated from
South Australia, where he was an
organiser for the Labor party, made a
marked debut in the politics of the
West by defeating Premier Mitchell for
Northam when Phil Collier swept the
Liberal Government away and began his
long reign. It would be hard to lift
Hawke from Northam now. Personally
popular, he plays a good game of tennis
and occasionally takes a turn in the pulpit
of the Methodist church.
One of the world’s happiest prelates
should be the R.C. Bishop of Argyle and
the Isles. Whenever funds for the com-
pletion of his cathedral of St. Columba
are running low all he has to do is to get
Father Sydney Mac Ewan to go on a
concert tour of Australia —all the profits
from which go into the building. Already
Father Mac Ewan has built his own
church of St. Margaret’s, Argyll (of
which he was appointed parish priest in
1949), out of the proceeds of concerts.
This is the Scottish tenor’s third visit to
Australia. A Glaswegian, he became a
dominie after graduating M.A. at his
home university, but on John Mc-
Cormack’s advice he abandoned the
chalk and easel for the cultivation of his
larynx. Since then he has been a pro-
fessional singer—this is his 21st year of
delineating the songs of the Celtic lands,

only by specially requesting him again—

Born in Victoria, student at the
Melbourne National Gallery with Jim
MacDonald, Meldrum and Hugh
Ramsay, young Patterson got off early to
Paris, had 12 years there, then crossed
to the U.S., with a spell painting in
Honolulu. Represented there and in the
Seattle Art Museum (as is his wife), and
in the Sydney and Adelaide galleries, he
has his own portrait, by Ramsay, hanging
in the Melbourne gallery. A painter of
landscapes among other subjects, the pro-
fessor, taken along by a Bulletin
man, could only gasp when he first
sighted the vast, reaching sweep of land-
scape falling away from Sublime Point,
out of Sydney. But he did his best with
a camera, American style—a wonder of
dials, figures and pointers. Next, he’s off
to Europe.

Association, also found time to give
certain other people cause for gratitude.
On his return from overseas in 1943 he
became a weekly visitor to Parramatta
Jail, where his smile was as warm as his
handshake, and neither varied a degree
whether greeting the Governor, prisoner,
warder or workman. As one of the last-
named I found him a most interesting con-
versationalist, warm patriot—as distinct
from a flagwagger—and sincere Christian
who didn’t try to “poke it down your
neck.” Prisoners “given the key” (de-
clared habitual criminals) were required to
convince a board of their reformation
before recommendation for release could
be made. One lag summed up the Brig.’s
attitude towards sinners in a sentence:
“If he can’t be with yer, he won’t be
against yer.” If the prisoners he be-
friended are as fair dinkum as he always
was the fund should be swelled by men
who were never in khaki.
New president of the Millions Club
(Sydney), John McLaren had had close
on 50 strenuous years in the Public
Service when he called it a day in 1936.
Entering the N. S. Wales P.M.G. Depart-
ment in 1888, he transferred to the Com-
monwealth with Federation, to rise
steadily to his peak in 1934, Acting High
Commissioner in London. A knighthood
came his way the following year. A
home-loving man, with tastes inclining to
literature and music, he’ll have now as
an additional sideline the selecting of a
prominent personality to address his
club’s members every week.
John Casson, son of Sybil Thorndike
and Sir Lewis Casson, new general-
producer for the Firm, is due in Mel-
bourne shortly. Forty-one, he didn’t don
the buskins till he had served 20 years
in the British Navy. Six years in the
Fleet Air Arm, in 1940 he was shot down
on an air-raid, and saw the rest of the
war out in the Stalag which was the scene
of the Wooden Horse escape story. He
and his wife and three daughters will

The Graziers’ Federal Council in Bris-
bane made an unusual decision when it
set out to seek recognition for the person
responsible for developing myxomatosis
as a bunny-destroyer. She is Melbourne’s
Dr, Jean MacNamara, otherwise known
as Dame Connor —the latter honor for
her brilliant work in the treatment of
infantile paralysis. Dame Connor was
awarded a Rockefeller scholarship for
her work on polio, and while studying at
Princeton (U.S.) she became interested
in animal viruses, especially myxomatosis.
She sent a specimen to Australia only to
have it destroyed by quarantine officials,
and a second attempt had no better
result. She then shifted her offensive to
the C.5.1.R.0., and finally, after a bit of
political pressure, won her point and the
first experiments on the national pest
started. Born at Beechworth (Vic.), she
was educated at P.L.C., Melbourne, and
the University, and is honorary child
specialist at the city’s Children’s Hospital,
Lieut.-Gencral Sir Stanley Savige and
W. L. Moss, president of the State
Country party, are new commissioners of
the Victorian State Savings Bank. The
soldier takes the place of Field Marshal
Blarney; the C.P. man, that of the late
Hector McKenzie.
R. W. Chenoweth gave up his job at
60 the other day. A kindly chap and
well-intentioned, he was the most
execrated man in Melbourne. For 21
years he had been deputy Commissioner
of Taxation.
Into the Silence:
In Perth, at 88, old-timer James B. Willis, one
of six farming sons who went to W.A. from Vic-
toria in 1891 and, from Nannine in the
Murchison country, saw Arthur Bailey ride
away on a trip which was to end in the finding
of fabulous Coolgardie the following year. After
an unpromising start running a butcher’s shop
on the goldfields to dispose of a mob of
bullocks he could not otherwise sell, Willis
prospered to the extent of buying Wongawol
Station, then Windidda Station, each of a
miiiion acres. In 1907, with James Nicholas,
later of Cobb and Co., he started horsebreeding
on Wongawol, and built his stud into one of
the finest in the State. He had sold both stations
recently, but still owned Clover Downs,
Leonora, at the end.
In Maryborough (Q.), at 69, William Henry
Hayes, for many years owner of Mt. Stanley
Station, Brisbane River. One of the biggest
men in Australia connected with the Indian
horse-trade, he sold thousands of horses,
bought from all over Queensland, to the big
shippers, and also shipped horses himself in
the boom years. He was well-known as a
horse judge and exhibitor until a decade ago.
At 76, in Melbourne, Richard Turnbull, since
1925 a committeeman of the V.R C. and since
1942 its chairman. The first chairman to win
the Melbourne Cup (with Sirius in 1944), he
had big pastoral interests in Queensland.
At Echuca (Vic.), at 70, Hector Thomas
McKenzie, a commissioner of the Savings Bank
and acting-chairman. Son of the late Hugh
McKenzie, former Minister for Railways, he
helped to found the Primary Producers’ Restora-
tion Association, formed to place Diggers on
the land in the depression. Two of his sons
were killed in action with the R.A.A.F. in the
late war.
In Toowoomba on the Downs, at 76, David
Horn, one of the Queen City’s best-known
medicos, one-time Chieftain of the Caledonian
Society. Born in Scotland, schooled at
Toowoomba Grammar and Melbourne Univer-
sity, he returned to the Downs with an arts
degree, to open a private school. Deciding on
medicine, he crossed back to Scotland, and
left Aberdeen University with his medicine and
surgery bachelors!dps. He practised in Too-
woomba for over 40 years. Both sons are
medicos.

COW
by JAMIS HACKSTON
AIL up! Go on, bail
up, y’ lazy cow!”
j We seemed to have
always had some sort
of a cow: mostly a down-
trodden, mournful-1 ook i n g
matron with no sense of humor.
So, as a boy milker, manager,
rouseabout, studmaster and
jackeroo on our place I became
aware of the prevailing bad
manners among some cows.
First of all, as a milker, I was
cognisant of the sad and dis-
agreeable fact that cows some-
times perform a certain act
while being milked, and that
this dastardly and extremely
nauseating offence is put into
effect without a moment’s notice
of warning of any kind what-
soever ; by reason of which per-
fidiousness I would get a splash
in my nearest eye, my (also
nearest) leg would be sprayed,
and, at the same time, the milk
watered, as it were.
I also became aware of the
(also sad) fact that a cow, after
having the wide, secret bush all
to herself for her own private
use, will come home, and, in a
most flagrant manner, deposit a
pat fair bang in the bail —more
than likely just where the milk-
ing-stool has to stand; or
(contumelious behavior) carry
out this operation while being
milked; on which occasions my
lessons on breeding and good
manners while in bail were
backed up by a weapon suitable
for the occasion—generally an
empty bucket or kerosene-tin
for preference, such weapons
providing a volume of noise and
violence that was in tonal keep-
ing with my instructive and
erudite profanity.
As I’d say to my mother
afterwards when defending such
violence on my part, “There is
a time and place for everythng,
Mum!”
In drought-time our cows had
to eat almost anything. Not
that I’m saying they ate rabbits
or goannas; but they might
have chewed the moss off old
fences and, at a pinch, say, taken
on the gum-leaves. Of course,
I wouldn’t swear to such ab-
normalities, I’m only suggesting
possibilities; although, one
starvation season, Mum said
that Stumps (this cow was
named after a couple of charred
stumps we owned and which re-
sembled her) ate gum-leaves.
Mum said she could taste
eucalyptus in Stumps’s milk. I
never told Mum it was the
eucalyptus off my hands, after
I’d rubbed some on my sore leg
just before milking, that she
could taste. So, after that, I
used to jeer at Stumps when she
annoyed me and say “Who eats
gum-leaves?” and you’d have
thought, the way she’d toss her
horns at me, that she was in-
dignantly repudiating such a
base and slanderous accusation
—she was a head-shaker and
always threatening to go me.
This Stumps was the worst
offence we’d ever owned; and
the summer she committed
suicide, or what might have
been suicide, in preference to re-
garding it as a mishap, was also
the worst summer that ever
owned us. The sun seemed to
have left the sky and come down
to within fifty yards or so of
the earth, from which seemingly
close position it almost rode on
our backs ; and it was on one
of these grilling days, when the
sun was riding her, that she
began to shake her head and
wave her horns at me m a more
sincere manner than she had
previously. Sensing trouble in
earnest this time, I made off just
as she lowered her head, sighted
me on the end of her nose, as
if taking aim, and, straightening
her tail out behind her, rudder-
like, so she wouldn’t veer off the
line and miss the target, dis-
charged herself at me.
Having in the past taught my-
self how to dodge snakes, scrub
bulls, stallions and outlaws’
hooves (and my sire’s hooves at
times —when he was on deck) I
knew my business; and also
having had practice ducking up
trees to see how many minutes
it would be before some fast-
approaching, enveloping-look-
ing north-wind bushfire would
reach us and devour us or not
devour us, I, naturally enough,
and, as tree-climbing was not
one of Stumps’s practices, beat
Stumps at tree-climbing; at
which she gave a most mourn-
ful bellow that had a suggestion
of the sad wailing notes of the
curlew in it, galloped round
and about in a most erratic and
(even for a cow) most undigni-
fied manner, then helter-
skeltered off at a furious pace,
her tail and teats all lying out in
a straight line like arrows in
flight.
When she came up with the
old shaft which my sire had
always patronised for his annual
“suicide,” she, with a sort of
now-hollow bellow which had
more of the sad notes of the
curlew than ever in it, and which
suggested that it might also be
the swansong of a cow, ere de-
parting for her last happy feed-
ing-ground, slithered, fell, or
deliberately plunged into the
black and gaping depths of what
was known as Duggan’s Duffer.
Sunstroke, I said ; but Mum
said it must have been the gum-
leaves.
I MUST say that I got a
* certain amount of amusement
and pleasure out of my life with
cows—apart from calves, of
course. These butters never let
up, and I generally wore some-
where or other on my hide
(most calves showed a decided
preference for my hindquarters)
a plum-colored bruise as a
guarantee of their feelings to-
wards me.
And yet, even in the midst of
my troubles with calves, I also
found amusement: a wicked,
cruel, selfish consolation in the
fact that when a bull-calf looked
at me with the sort of threaten-
ing look which, I thought, said
plainly that when he grew up
into a savage bull he’d gore me
to death, I’d smirk with the
sure, sweet knowledge that his
chance of ever growing into a
savage bull, even if he did
have the luck to grow up big
enough to be a bull, was one in
a million. This knowledge never
failed to add a fuller flavor to
the kick or wallop which I was
about to administer.
I got a lot of real fun out of
the milking. First of all the
sound of the milk raining into
the bucket filled me with a de-
sire not only to sing, but urged
me to play tunes, and my own
accompaniments, by squirting
the milk on to the sides of the
bucket; and I always made the
most of the opportunity offered
me when the first spears of
milk hit the bottom of the
empty bucket, the emptiness
providing a deep, strong, vibrant
tone that inspired me to sing
and play more ambitious stuff.
Sometimes my songs and
compositions demanded that
several teats be played at the
same time, other times a lesser
number —full tone, half tone,
which necessitated a vigorous
treatment in the one case and
in the other a more gentle or
lighter pull —this for the more
sentimental stulf.
Then there were songs that
only needed one teat to play the
accompaniment and called for
no more than a single jerky
movement. For instance, the
rhythmic beat of a song my sire
heard sung as a duet by a man
and woman in the streets of
London was an easy one to ac-
company, and, besides being my
favorite, one which I thought
most appropriate for singing to
matronly milkers. I particularly
liked the end to it, for it gave
me an opportunity to mimic a
woman’s voice selling copies of
the song, which mimicry my sire
also brought from London.
When rendering this importa-
tion I’d use a boyish tenor voice
for the woman’s lines and, with
appropriate milking—one teat
playing—sing merrily:
“1 would I were, but it’s all in
vain,
I would I were a maid again.”
Then I’d assume a deep bass
voice for the man’s part:
“Oh, a maid again thou ne’er
shall be
Till apples grow on an orange-
tree.”
And then imitate a woman’s
high-pitched voice calling out:
“Only a Ha’penny ! Only a
Ha’penny!”
DAYS when I went in for
reciting instead of singing
I’d back up the fire of my recita-
tion with different kinds of
squirts. I’d developed poetical
squirts, exciting squirts, fiery
squirts, warlike squirts and when
in the mortal throes of some of
Walter Scott’s lines, I’d some-
times discharge a whole volley
of teats in one blast which gave
an added force and dramatic

Achievements of an Industry — No. 6.
PENICIUIN exclusively British in its discovery
and development, is recognised throughout the world as
one of the greatest scientific achievements of all time.
Its discovery in 1929 and its name were due to Professor
(now Sir) Alexander Fleming, of St. Mary’s Hospital,
London. The isolation of penicillin and its development
as a practical weapon in the fight against disease was due
to a team of research workers in Oxford led by Dr. (now
Sir) Howard Florey and Dr. E. Chain, Penicillin, product
of a simple mould, possesses astonishing bacteria-killing
properties. Carried by the blood to all parts of the body,
it attacks bacteria wherever they are established. Unlike
so many other drugs, penicillin is not poisonous. Hence
it can be used by doctors and surgeons without any fear
of an overdose proving harmful to the patient.
Early research on penicillin was attended by great
difficulties. At first it was only possible to produce minute
quantities from the mould (Penicillium notatum) and the
substance was easily destroyed by heat, acids, enzymes and
air-borne bacteria. Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. was
the first industrial concern in Britain to make substantial
quantities for chemical and biological investigation. The
crude, unstable material then produced has since been
superseded by an almost pure substance. Penicillin of
1.C.1.’s manufacture is now a white crystalline product of
known composition, which retains its activity for three
years in all climates.

power to my delivery, as fol-
lows :
“Now yield thee, or by Him
who made
The world, thy heart’s blood
dyes my blade!”
(Series of single, peremptory
squirts.)
“Thy threats, thy mercy, I
defy !
Let recreant yield who fears
to die.”
(Salvo of full, truculent
squirts.)
“Like adder darting from his
coil,”
(Vicious, quick, short squirt.)
“Like wolf that dashes through

(Long, fast-sweeping, dashing
squirt.)
“Like mountain-cat who guards
her young.
Full at Fitz-James’s throat he
sprung”;
(Sudden, explosive fusillade of
all teats operating.)
And so on.
Other times I’d amuse myself
with my fancy milking—one
finger, two, three, four; two
teats two fingers, three teats
three fingers, four teats four
fingers ; down shots, side shots,
criss-cross shooting and then
both hands to it and the squirts
all zigzagging across each other
at a great bat and working up to
a frenzy of fireworks almost.
This brilliant display over, I’d
trace circles in the milk, ovals
and squares, and when at my
best could outline the shape of
a star, this operation having to
be performed at a high rate of
speed so that no part faded out
before I’d completed the whole
star.
And I nearly forgot to
mention that I could milk my
own signature.
Then there was my special
feat of milking with my bare
feet. This was an art which
called for much competence be-
cause, to get into the right
position and at the correct dis-
tance, I had to lean back on my
stool, and, at times, my sense of
balance failing me, the stool
would tip over, I’d fall back, the
bucket of milk go flying, the
cow get mad and excited and
kick the leg-rope free, kick me,
kick the bail, kick anything and
everything, pull and plunge
frantically and like hell to get
her head free, and, while the
shed and bail creaked, groaned,
shook and trembled, the calf,
tethered not far off and smell-
ing the milk, would start plung-
ing wildly and like a son of Satan
to get to its mother ; all these
different stirring and tempestu-
ous operations, on appearances,
looking like all the calamities
grouped in one, but, for all that,
not in the least upsetting really,
and, when happening after one
of my bouts with Sir Walter’s
fiery lines, no more than a
period in life that was in per-
fect keeping with the fierceness
and fury of my hero —Chieftain
Roderick Dhu.
After which, using the now-
empty bucket fof my “blade,”
the “Chieftain” and the four-
footed “Fitz-James” would
again meet in combat—in a
cow-shed.
BUT one day a different sort
of excitement came to the
bail.
I was milking Cockeye
(named after her own looks), an
unfriendly, angular, sour-faced,
scraggy, poor milker, and was
in the middle of doing my best
to squeeze “Rule Britannia” out
of her when we had a visitor.
It was another one of those
still, hot, breathless days when
you could hear the gum-leaves
groping for breath ; see the old
grey shed wrinkling its slabs ;
see flame in the sky. I’d left
Cockeye’s tail free so that she
could help keep the flies off me.
Into this pressing, pulseless
silence came a clear, unbroken,
ominous hissing. Looking to the
left of me, and a little to the
back of me, without hardly
moving my head, I spied the
snake, too close on me now for
me to move, well up on his
haunches, tongue out, and

looking for all the world like a
mammoth note of interrogation
about to enter the bail.
He’d come across our cow-
yard from the direction of a
small patch of bush, and it
looked as if he might have been
asking where was the milk, and,
at the same time, telling us that
if we objected to his presence
there’d be trouble.
Eighteen inches off and only
two feet from me at my back,
he pulled up, deck still cleared
for action, head swinging,
tongue still out, still hissing,
waiting to see how the land lay.
We stood dumb and motionless
while he did the talking.
I couldn’t possibly move to
settle him, for, had I done so,
I’d have probably been bitten.
So, very cautiously, I stole my
eyes round to see how Cockeye
was taking it, and her calf, too,
which was tied up at the top
end of the bail. Cockeye’s
nearest eye had also stolen
round, without a move of her
head, and she looked dreadfully
still. The calf’s eyes, enlarged,
were staring at the beady-eyed
visitor with a deep, dread under-
standing, and he was dreadfully
still.
I was still holding on to one
of Cockeye’s teats ; still squeez-
ing it; and the sudden perspira-
tion that had flooded my palm
was making the teat feel warm,
soft and slippery in my hand.
The visitor again moved on,
advancing in a straight line
down the middle of the bail, and
now lying right at my back and
hissing: Where in the hell is
the milk? The flies, uninter-
rupted, were like a swarm of
bees about us.
Still hanging on to Cockeye’s
teat and with the pressure still
unrelaxed, the teat feeling like
a link between us, as if cow, calf
and I had suddenly been trans-
formed into a friendly unit by
the proximity of danger, I
stole another look at Cockeye
and read a sympathetic expres-
sion in her eye which said that,
as she reckoned I was about to
leave this mortal coil, she would
like me to know, ere I departed,
that she bore no grudge against
me for flaying her with the yard
broom; and had forgotten all
about my squeezing her cracked
teat unnecessarily.
Here the visitor shoved on
another stage and then Cockeye
came more into the picture and,
as things were now looking
threatening for her, too, I
could not help but take the
opportunity of catching her eye
in a forgiving manner concern-
ing the day she tossed me out of
the bail; the morning she kicked
me in the eye, and with the same
kick relieved me of one of my
good front teeth ; and which said
I was sorry that she might so
soon be leaving for a place
whence no cow returns.
AND now the tiger and his
eternal “siss-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s”
began to sway this way and that
way (and within easy striking
distance of us all, too) as if un-
decided whether to hang round
a bit longer on the offchance
of getting at the milk (here he
took what looked like a disdain-
ful screw at me) or whether to
make a sudden, quick spring at
me, bite me, and then, while
I was tearing frantically about
searching for first-aid, or treat-
ing myself, have a swig out of
the bucket.
Next he sort of put his hands
behind his back and walked up
and down as if in deep thought,
thinking it over, and I noticed
he was getting dangerously near
the calf, and if the calf, at this
most inopportune of all
moments, should forget himself
(and he sometimes did, too),
he’d be bitten.
Here I felt it incumbent on
me, especially as Mum had
taught me to think and act like
a gentleman (no picking my
nose on Sundays; no washing
my feet in the milk ; no using
my forefinger instead of the
butter-knife), that 1 should, as
the calf had done for me, look
at him in a brotherly manner,
too ; and so I gave him a look
which said I hoped he would
come through all right and
grow up and achieve that great
ambition which all bull-calves so
ardently desired.
As a gentleman of the first
water, of course, I made no
reference in my brotherly look
to the large-as-a-dinner-plate,
rainbow-colored bruise that was
at the very moment adoring all
of the left cheek and part of
the right cheek of my bottom.
By this time the tiger had
evidently come to a decision to
give the milk a go some other
time, and without further ado
put his hiss away, poked his
arrogant head through the slabs,
and began to draw away.
With stealthy tread, Roderick
Dhu, all tense and set, now
crept upon the treacherous foe
and, after giving him enough
time to get well clear of the bail
and far enough away so that he
could not double-back, full at
his throat he sprung (in theory)
and, breathing fiercely, de-
claimed :
“No maiden’s hand is round
thee thrown !
That desperate grasp thy frame
might feel
Through bars of brass and
triple steel ! —
They tug, they strain! Down,
down they go,”
and wallop, wallop, wallop, the
note of interrogation disin-
tegrated and gave place to a very
much flattened and battered
dead tiger-snake. This done, I
returned to the bail with the
dead visitor draped (general
Australian practice) over the
stick.
All danger now over, we all
resumed our former cold, un-
friendly and hostile relations,
Cockeye began to again shake
her head and moo irritably and
the calf again became a plung-
ing inferno to get to her.
Finished milking, I let Cockeye
out of the bail and let her have
a series of special wallops with
the dead snake; then tied it
round the calf’s neck as an
accompaniment to the usual kick
in the belly he invariably got as
a send-off after “milkin’.”
AND so the “milkin’” went
on until Cockeye went dry;
we sold her calf to the butcher,
the sun withdrew behind the
grey clouds, rain came, creek
flooded, floodwater subsided, the
sides became a slide of slippery
clay, the bed a full issue of silt
and mud ; after which Cockeye
slipped down the bank, gathered
speed during the journey and
fell with a penetrating thud into
the deep, squelchy, sticky, clog-
ging, holding softness below.
When I found her she was
floundering badly and sinking
fast at the stern.
It was a big job digging her
out, and as I fought to save her
from disappearing altogether, I
got somewhat bogged myself,
and so soft was the going down
that it was hard to tell at times
who was the bogged and who
was the rescuer. Sometimes it
seemed that Cockeye was sink-
ing faster than the rescuer, other
times that the rescuer was going
down the faster.
Uncle Paul, who was a
humorist, came over and, after
viewing the situation scientifi-
cally, suggested dynamite.
However, with his lore and
without the aid of dynamite or
any other explosive, Uncle Paul
got Cockeye out, and, with
Cockeye and I up on the dry
bank, led the family in a wild
chorus of hilarity and mad
laughter as he averred that, as
far as he knew, the strange
creature he had just rescued and
which somewhat resembled a
mud cow might be some pre-
historic creation that had come
to life again after millions of
years.
So Uncle now inspected the
strange creature in a more
scholarly manner and informed
the assembled and jolly com-
pany that, upon a closer study
of the exhibit, he would venture
the opinion that it most certainly
was nothing less than the last,
solitary and sole remaining liv-
ing specimen of the bunyip—
with one of her young.
And now Cockeye, after she
had been dry-cleaned, retired, in
due course, to the Common and
there met Thunder, the old
vociferous bull who roamed and
roared the Common down, and,
with the passing of time and
also in keeping with our proud
reputation for being the most
unlucky family in the district,
died calving.
LADY was our next venture ;
a different sort of cow from
the others. Uncle Paul got her
for us, and if I were to say that,
to buy her, we had to forgo
drinking red wine with our red
meat and white wine with our
white meat, then you’d know
we had to put up a struggle to
get her.
Looking at her, and judging
her by the standard of woman,
she was a duchess among cows
and a member of society—even
though (after she’d come to us)
her husband was an ordinary
bloke called Thunder.
She was a yellowy, biscuit
color, with a soft silky coat;
good-looker, too; soft dark
eyes, as black almost, but not
as burning-black, as the abo.
girl’s eyes, who sat next to me at
school, from whom I copied
and whom I loved desperately ;
so much so that my love inter-
fered with my education.
Grace and refinement —that
was Lady. Never a faux pas by
her in the bail. She was a
whopping big cow, too, and so
round and rotund and her udder
so large that, when I’d bail her
up, I felt like taking her arm in
a gentlemanly manner and help-
ing her gallantly into the bail.
Yes, she was a big-bosomed
aristocrat, slow and stately.
Lord knows how much she
measured in circumference, and
I used to poke, feel and prod at
her sides and wonder what on
earth it could be that could
possibly go towards making up
enough stuff to fill such a flagon
of bulk and girth.
Milk! Never in all our born
days had we known such a
deluge. You wouldn’t believe
it. Cream! She was a walking
butter-factory on four legs.

"A Victorian
Marriage."
Warwick Fairfax’s “A Vic-
torian Marriage,” put on by the
John Alden Company at St.
James Hall, Sydney, is not a
bad play at all.
A young Sydney heir of the
’seventies wants to marry an
actress; his father’s partner, an
old roue, wants to make the
actress his mistress, explaining
that, as the wife of a gentleman,
she will be shunned, but as the
mistress of a knight (himself)
she will be courted. But the
actress, anxious for the novelty
of respectable life, calls on the
boy’s father. She falls in love
with the father, and he, too, is
shaken. But at his wife’s in-
sistence he forbids the match.
The actress becomes the part-
ner’s mistress, and all the main
characters meet, by mistake, at
the partner’s country home. In
a touching scene with the boy’s
mother the partner reveals that
he is the true father, and bit-
terly laments not being able to
acknowledge his son: he re-
solves that the actress shall
repair this disability. But by
then the betrayed father, always
unaware of it, finds life too
strong for him and pops off into
a paddock with the actress to
do as he had been done by. The
play ends with the mother and
the actress consoling each other
on these ironic misadventures.
The play has thus the
materials of a witty farce,
intense drama, and of the
social life of the ’seventies,
and if the author had had a
stronger driving force it might
have been more of one piece,
either more brilliant comedy or
more moving drama. On the
stage not to be sure is a handi-
cap. In the same way a more
experienced author might have
been more clear and succinct
with his dialogue, which, in
striving to evoke the intellectual
atmosphere of the times, and
especially when it rises from
Matthew Arnold, ties the actors
in knots.
“Here they are for you to
see,” says the author in a foot-
note ; but of “the old aristo-
cratic traditions” of the ’seven-
ties, the foremost was finish,
both in life and on the stage;
and a play that is not clear and
direct cannot hope to represent
them. Still, it may be argued
that the aristocracy of Sydney
was a little cruder than that of
London; thus the difference
noticeable between Mr. Fair-
fax’s and Mr. Wilde’s treat-
ments of times not very widely
separated may be artistically
explained.
The actors seem to favor
that explanation. With the ex-
ceptions of Charles Tasman’s
butler and of the exquisite
ballet-like courtship scene by
Ron Graham and Shirley Hall
the acting lacks bloom. As the
roud John Alden drowns the
moustachio’d wickedness of his
part behind the whiskers and
bluff, bawling geniality of a
country churchwarden; as the
heir to “aristocratic traditions”
Joel McCormick is indeed
artistically his son. Miss Queenie
Ashton makes a plausible,
patient, repentant mother, but
both she and Miss Huia Monro
lack the regal sweep and
grandeur which were the most
noticeable traits of the ladies
and actresses of those days.
Owen Weingott, as the father,
has something of the poise and
the serious and sincere air of a
gentleman of those times—it is
about the best acting one has
seen him do.
For all of which the play is
well contrived; it is a play-
wright’s play, and not an intel-
lectual essay for the stage; the
sets, by Maurice Sullivan,
especially the Australian brick
cottage in the country, and the
effects gained by opening win-
dows on detailed backdrops,
could hardly have been improved
upon. If the tone were more
certain—up to the standard of
Mr. Tasman’s butler and of the
courtship scene, for instance —
it might have made the box-
office tinkle like the tills in cer-
tain marble halls of which deli-
cacy forbids mention.
Franquin.
The disbeliever who goes to
see Franquin, the hypnotist at
Sydney Empire, is likely to have
a few preconceived notions
badly bent when he tries to work
out how the fellow from the
audience—whose job of squeez-
ing lemons and bottling soft-
drinks doesn’t exactly call for
the exercise of extraordinary
mnemonic powers—is suddenly
enabled to reel off any of 40
names and their corresponding
numbers, having had no more
opportunity to memorise them
than any of the audience.
On the other hand, the sceptic
would get no setback as he
pondered the strange fact that
the only subject invited to sing
a current “hit” tune at the mike
turned out to have quite a fair
voice and was word-perfect in
the song—probably not one in
200 of the audience would be
able, if ordinarily ushered to a
piano, to get both tone and
words off pat.
Irrespective of such pros and
cons, however, Franquin cer-
tainly dispenses brisk entertain-
ment, and that, after all, is the
main purpose of his appearance.
Whether the subjects under
hypnosis are savagely hurling
plucked-off shoes into the front
stalls at supposed midnight-
yowling cats, temporarily be-
coming world-famous violinists
before rapt audiences, or falling
under the weight of an ordinary
topcoat handed to them, but
which the hypnotist avers weighs
a couple of hundred pounds,
the audience gets a whale of a
lot of laughs, and it’s well worth
the money to get that surcease
for a few hours from strikes,
shortages, blackouts, strap-
hanging and filling in tax
returns.
Art.
“O.F.” r Margaret Olley’s
“Pont Neuf, Paris,” with the
slightest suggestion of warmth
touched in over its cold greys
and blues; Fred Jessup’s “Place
Dauphine,” with more color but
less warmth ; the hot reds and
browns of Drysdale’s “Study for
Composition”: Carl Plate’s
“Coming of the Locusts,” with
its swarming patterns of line
and color; and Enid Cam-
bridge’s light and sunny “Road
in the Bush” are the most
notable items in the exhibition
of prints and drawings at the
Macquarie Galleries, Sydney.
The placid mistiness of Ena
Joyce’s “Thames Sketch” is
marred by too much smudgy
blue; James Sharp records a
stubby solidity in his “Head-
land, Byron Bay” ; Jean Bellete’s
“Joan” suffers from a malformed
shoulder ; James Gleeson makes
some morbid reflections over a
corpse in “Finis”; Ronald
Millen has a few distressingly
gloomy “Magnolias” and L.
Meillerts’s “Street, Bondi Beach,”
is sunburned to a sore, raw pink.
Imre Szigeti’s “Dawn and the
City” looks rather like a tooth-
paste advertisement depicting a
lonely germ prowling about a
row of blackened molars —
which is possibly what the artist
intended —and Ian Fairweather’s
“Syntax” might have been done
with one finger and a bottle
each of blue and red ink.

At George’s, Melbourne,
sculptress Lorraine Whiting ex-
presses herself in alabaster,
Belgian marble, Beaufort sand-
stone, Queensland cedar, Denili-
quin boree, Mornington golden
wattle, goroke buloke, Kaniva
lambertiana and pinus radiata —
in fact, her catalogue resembles
a Forestry Commission hand-
book. The forms are equally
exotic. They range from pure
abstractions to the vaguest sug-
gestion of something human.
The question is, how much of
observation is there in them?
There isn’t likely to be any
more than there is in her por-
traits. And it must be admitted
that her “Odalisque,” a woman’s
face in green plaster, is indis-
tinguishable from the models in
any draper’s window.

Ludmilla Meilerts, the Latvian
artist who served her Aus-
tralian indentures as a nurse at
Heidelberg Military Hospital,
provides a bright show of oils
and pastels at the Athenaeum
Gallery, Melbourne. Miss
Meilert’s endeavors to adapt her-
self to the Australian landscape
are generally more successful
than her portraits, and her still-
life—a large portrait, “The
Bride,” priced at 280 guineas—
suffers from superficial observa-
tion and exposes the weaknesses
in the artist’s method of juxta-
posing spots of paint of dif-
ferent colors.

An “exhibition of works based
on the Borovansky Ballet” had
a brief display in the foyer of
Sydney Empire Theatre at the
close of the ballet season. Of
the three artists represented,
Elsa Russell and Piers Bourke
seem to run mainly to a kind of
blob - and - scratch technique
which misses more often than it
hits any satisfactory impression
—Elsa Russell’s “Dancing
Sailors” (presumably from “The
Black Swan”) and Bourke’s “Les
Sylphides” have a brief, passing
effect The sketches and water-
colors of the third artist, Dora
Jarret, are, by comparison,
much more faithful and sub-
stantial work. The sketches,
slight though they are, are clear
and graceful, and, although the
watercolors may be of more
moment to ballet than to paint-
ing, they are full and finished
pictures and, particularly in the
case of “Petrouchka,” not with-
out a color and vitality that
comes as much from the artist
as the subject.
Music.
Yehudi Menuhin wended his
way through three majestic pro-
grammes at Melbourne Town
Hall. Some commentators found
his playing cold and lacking in
feeling—he had become a mere
technician —but what probably
happened was that they noted
the cool composure coming from
his extraordinary control. Any-
how, if he displayed an almost
unbelievable dexterity in the
“Devil’s Trill” sonata, there was
no evidence of lack of feeling.
Nor was there any such lack in
the Bach E Major unaccom-
panied sonata. Paganini set the
violin world some stiff problems
in his D Major concerto, but
Menuhin’s bow sizzled through
them as if they weren’t there.

Until last week Brisbane
audiences had had to be content
to hear one of the world’s finest
Wagnerian singers accompanied
by a piano which struggled hope-
lessly to outline 'the tremendous
scores for Brunnhilde and
Isolde. Then, at the fourth sub-
scription concert of the Queens-
land Symphony Orchestra —itself
revitalised by the conducting of
Alceo Galliera Marjorie
Lawrence sang “Isolde’s Narra-
tion.” Conditioned by many
years of listening to the clear
streams of singing in the Italian
and Viennese styles, many of the
audience seemed to be engulfed
by the waves of this ocean of
music, but those who survived
the onslaught came through
with a new experience in musical
values.

Australian-born Dr. George
Thalben Ball, brought out under
the A.B.C. banner, shares with
Sir Malcolm Sargent the dis-
tinction of being a Freeman of
London city, and when the
French Organ Music Society
singled him out to give a recital
at St. Eustache, Paris, Germani,
the famous organist at St.
Peter’s, Rome, travelled from
Italy to Paris especially to hear
him. Melbourne City Council
did something almost as remark-'
able when it gave him the free-
dom of its instrument the other
evening concertgoers had
almost forgotten what the huge
affair was there for. Dr. Ball
made it dance in a distinguished
manner, though the piece
selected, being Sir Henry
Wood’s arrangement for full
orchestra of Handel’s concerto
No. 7 in B flat major, wasn’t as
distinguished as the playing. Dr.
Edgar Bainton conducted.

III,:
THE ADMIRABLE LANDLADY
by E.O.SCHLUNKE
THE first time you see her
you know that she is a
good woman ; though you
are a bit surprised that
“Mrs. Kentucky’s Guest House”
is only an average-sized weather-
board cottage.
But that worried young-old
face ; those work-worn hands ;
the very blond hair (which
might be greying at the temples)
drawn back into a tight,
businesslike bun from which a
few strands escape, to be
brushed away impatiently a
hundred times, but never secured
because there isn’t time. Those
big blue eyes which look at you
so anxiously when you arrive,
trying to decide if you are an
honorable man (and a prompt
payer), and hoping so fervently
that she will not have to turn
away money.
Then, how friendly when she
decides you will do, and forth-
with brings you a cup of tea
because you are done in from
your fifty-mile hunt for a lodg-
ing. And because you are so
tired the cheap iron bedstead
under the closed-in veranda
looks tolerably good, and you
don’t worry too much about the
other two beds behind an in-
adequate curtain further along
the veranda, though you realise
that the occupants will have to
pass through your room.
Over the cup of tea Mrs.
Kentucky becomes confidential.
She could tell by your face that
you are an honest man. Nobody
could put anything over her.
She’s been at the game too long.
And did they try to ram things
down her neck? You bet they
did. Especially the unmarried
couples. They’d come to her,
pretending they’d been married
for years. And she’d pretend to
believe them ; give them a cup
of tea. And then the woman
would put her foot right in it;
“Do you take sugar, dear?”
Somehow or other, they always
gave themselves away. She
could generally tell at the first
glance, but she had to be careful.
It wouldn’t do to have any of
that sort at her guesthouse,
'T' HOUGH you have learnt
1 something about carrying-
capacity from your veranda, still
you are surprised when twelve
guests file into the dining-room.
Mrs. Kentucky has told you
about her three children and
“Tom,” who have to live some-
where too. They are all hard at
work now in the kitchen while
Mrs. Kentucky shoots in and
out of the dining-room, face pale
and drawn with worry at this
strenuous climax of the day;
making nearly twice as many
trips as necessary because she is
always a bit too soon with
everything.
After dinner the guests
wander about on the buffalo-
grass which grows in green
billows up to a foot high all
over the foreshore and overruns
the yard except in those parts
where Tom keeps it mown. You
learn a bit more about how Mrs.
Kentucky solves the accom-
modation problem.
In the yard is an auto-tent,
and under it are a small car and
two beds. The two beds, you
discover, are occupied by Mrs.
Kentucky and Tom.
You have a talk to Tom. He
is a modest fellow, dressed in
athletic singlet and khaki shorts,
stocky, with a considerable
waistline; his sunburnt face is
dominated by a nose which re-
minds you to ask him what time
of the day the local pubs turn
the beer on. He has small, good-
humored, bright, brown eyes
that are just a bit sly. He is a
great friend of all the fisherman
guests. He talks of tides and
baits and hooks and lines and
they all listen respectfully. He
arranges for an expedition at a
fabulously early hour next
morning. He will row the boat
to the headland, and they will
drift back with the tide. A good
chance for snapper or bream.
“Or whiting,” one of the guests
says ; but Tom doesn’t give him
much hope. “We could drift up
towards Melunga Bay and row
back” But Tom shakes his
head and puts on an uneasy
grin. They look at his fat belly
and chuckle.
“I’ll help you row,” says one,
but Tom still looks embarrassed.
“I always get back in time to
help with the breakfasts,” he
says, though he doesn’t like
admitting it. “She’s pretty busy
getting the children away to
school and looking after twelve
guests.”
They all understand and
murmur admiringly about the
colossal amount of work Mrs.
Kentucky does without a single
maid to help her. That restores
the pleasant atmosphere, and
they talk about how beautifully
cool it is, and sniff at the easterly
coming in heavy with salty
moisture ; they watch the lighted
pleasure launches coming round
the innumerable bends in Car-
teret Water; they listen to the
puttering outboard motors and
the skylarking boaters in-
visible on the water; and
the shouts of the inevitable
drunks. Those who come from
crowded, overheated Sydney
and those from the scorched
Western Plains are brothers and
sisters in beatitude. There is
only one little hiatus in the flow
of goodwill when someone calls
Tom “Mr. Kentucky.” Tom is
quite upset; he won’t have none
of that mistering business.
AT bedtime, blundering about
in the dark for the lavatory,
you open the door of a small,
shed-like building and discover
that it is a laundry-bedroom.
That accounts for the two
smaller children. There remains
only the teen-age daughter. It
almost makes you hesitate about
going into the lavatory when
you ultimately find it.
Discussing things later with
the two guests who have to pass
through your room, you are told
that the daughter is the only
member of the family who
sleeps in the house. She has a
tiny room where her virtue is
much safer than it would be
in a flimsy tent out on the
buffalo-grass on a summer night.
You dip your lid to Mrs.
Kentucky, who forgoes an
additional three guineas a week
for sweet morality’s sake.
NEXT morning when you go
for your early dip, you see
Mrs. Kentucky more frantically
busy than ever, her muscled legs
under the short, workwoman-
like skirts propelling her along
with torpedo-like speed, and a
vertical wrinkle added to the
deep lines across her forehead.
She greets you cheerily, but her
smile is wan. You wonder why
she should worry so much about
feeding a few easygoing people.
At breakfast she is nearly
panting as she hurtles in and
out of the dining-room only just
VARIOUS VERSE
FASHIONED, WITH THE SHELL-LIKE MOON.
Fashioned, with the shell-like moon, in this white cove
By the round and hollow rolling call of love
And wattles rustling in their darkened gold,
We are the motive the world shall always hold.
Like a shell, sigh inward with the April sea,
And cool as the silken wave lie down in me.
No other image shall the near moon draw
More rounded than our tide along the shore.
Though we recede to where the tide began
Beyond the wattles and the storm and rain
Omened by the wakeful bird and misting star,
The dream we worship makes us what we are.

THE MONARO.
Old Willie Gray will sit and stare
On one-tree-hill the whole day long
And green grass parrots fly in at his ear
And lay their eggs of rounded song
Leaving them there for the words to hatch
Like the floating seed from the thistle patch.
Old Willie Gray has a ten-mile stare
And his eyes are droving with a dream of sheep
Down raddled stock-routes to tread white air
Where old Willie Gray has a thought as deep
And as rounded as a river stone,
And over the paddocks goes the daylight moon.
Old Willie Gray has a lover’s eye
And it goes over the twin bare hills
And the blond valleys to the bleached sky
Until it has come to a thought that fills
His mind with tenderness for this wild
Upland country and her suckling child.

THE FUNGUS.
Leave it alone. Don’t touch it! Oh, but don’t touch it.
That crimson is nature’s warning, those flecks that blotch it
Reek with their leathery stench of corruption and poison.
And say it is only a fungus, speckled and crimson
With gaping throat and tentacles wavering out
Under a log in the sun; but then how it loves
To hide in the dark where the grass is thick and sour—
Leave it alone! For white like the egg of a snake
In its shell beside it another begins to break,
And under those crimson tentacles, down that throat,
Secret and black still gurgles the oldest ocean
Where, evil and beautiful, sluggish and blind and dumb,
Life breathes again, stretches its flesh and moves
Now like a deep-sea octopus, now like a flower,
And does not know itself which to become.

Since buying his Bulldog in
1936 Mr. Schneider has won
seven crop-and-fallow trophies
in district competitions.

M % SAYS MR.VIC.SCHNEIDER OF MURTOA.VIC.
’S a man whose whole career
was changed for the better 14
years ago when he bought a Bulldog
Crude 051 Tractor. Until 1936, Mr.
Vic. Schneider, like a lot of farmers,
was having a raw deal —slow, expensive
horses, bad years, and the depression
were all against him. Now look at the
picture after ’36—his Bulldog year.
First, Mr. Schneider estimates Bulldog’s
economy has saved him well over
£lOOO on what a kerosene tractor
would have cost for the same period.
On top of that, he’s enjoyed Bulldog’s
reliability and power, which have con-
tributed to good average yields from all
crops and a record 17 bags per acre
harvest in 1948-49.
“My Bulldog hasn’t depreciated a
bit,” says Mr. Schneider. “In fact, it’s
worth more now than 1 paid for it 14
years ago. The big sums it has saved
have built up a complete second plant.”
Mr. Schneider must have a reliable
tractor to care for his 1700 acres.
“With Bulldog you can finish ploughing
in the winter and know she’s right to
start ‘first kick’ next season.” Looking
back over the years Mr. Schneider con-
cludes: “Through lean years and good
years, the Bulldog has been for me a
very economical and reliable tractor.”

“Over the 11 years we’ve
had our Lanz Bulldog, a
kerosene tractor would
have cost us at least
£1,400 more to run and
maintain,” says Mr. W.
Vin Russell of Woome-
lang, Victoria. As he
usually fallows, culti-
vates, sows and strips 800
acres (of wheat) a year,
his Bulldog has covered
the equivalent of 4000
acres every year since it
was bought.
“Repairs have been very
light, and fuel consump-
tion low —on hard work we get 15 hours running from a
tankful of about 18 gallons. “Our Bulldog will do 60 to 70
acres of cropping a day quite comfortably,” says Mr Rus-
sell, “and I recall when we cropped 1000 acres of wheat
in 10 days—using a relay of four drivers.”
In conclusion, says Mr. Russell, “WE KNOW that we
couldn’t have got where we are today without Bulldogs.”

in time with the porridge and
chops. She says with a small,
self-pitying smile: “Tom’s not
back yet. Letting me do all the
breakfast on my own.”
The guests urge her to relax,
but she won’t. Then they tell
her, encouragingly, that Tom
will bring back a boatload of
fish, but though a momentary
flash of hope (that has some-
thing to do with the price of
meat) passes over her face, she
is too experienced really to
expect that sort of compensa-
tion.
When breakfast is nearly over
the fisherman guests come in.
Only two small fish have been
caught, and those by the chemist
who is leaving today and wants
to take them home to his family.
The wives of several of the
fishers speak to them accusingly
about keeping Tom from his
duty. But they explain about
how strongly the tide was run-
ning ; how it was still very early
when they were swept past the
guesthouse, and as they had no
fish they decided to drift a bit
further. And then a strong
wind sprang up, and it was
almost impossible to make any
headway on the way back. Tom
had nearly exhausted himself in
his efforts.
Timing his entry very well,
Tom enters just then, with a
boyishly ashamed and resentful
look on his face. Mrs. Kentucky
gives him a wan smile of for-
giveness that seems to lacerate
his conscience. He dives into
the dishwashing with a great
clatter; one of the fisherman
guests gives him a hand, telling
Mrs. Kentucky to have a rest.
But Mrs. Kentucky is hotly in
pursuit of a theoretical frag-
ment of time she lost this morn-
ing. Bed-making and lunch are
piling up on her.
Only in the afternoon, when
she is handing round cups of
tea, do you see any sign of re-
laxation. She has taken off her
apron and put on one quick,
misdirected slash of lipstick.
Though she sits down with her
guests to drink a cup, she per-
forates her rest with telephone-
calls to the milkman, butcher
and greengrocer.
KJEXT morning there is no
* ’ sun. But a cold south-
easterly is blowing, so chill, and
damp with spray, that it feels as
if it is carrying half the
Pacific Ocean with it. There is
no fun in the early swim, but
some edification in seeing Mrs.
Kentucky at work in the
laundry-bedroom (while the
two younger children sleep un-
easily in a cloud of steam)
finishing a wash that occupies
two chain-long clotheslines and
is flapping violently enough to
carry off lines and laundry too.
Tom is helping her dutifully,
but harassing her with forecasts
of rain, heavy and immediate.
And Tom is right. It rains,
and it rains all day. The guests
huddle in the dining-room round
the coke-burner and radio, and
impede Mrs. Kentucky in her
work. Some of them leave, and
the telephone keeps ringing with
cancellations from those about
to come. Mrs. Kentucky con-
tinues to smile with desperate
courage on her few remaining
guests; sending Tom out to
hang the washing on the line at
every temporary lull, and shout-
ing at him to bring it in again
every time the rain starts. Tom
obviously thinks it is all a
foolish waste of time ; but he is
humoring her; the rain is rob-
bing her at the rate of four
pounds a day, and that is about
all she can stand.
During one of the lulls a taxi
arrives. A flashily prosperous-
looking man talks earnestly
with Mrs. Kentucky at the door,
while a woman smokes a
cigarette in the car. Then they
go away again. Mrs. Kentucky
tells the dining-room guests:
“He offered me a fiver for a
double room for the weekend,
but he didn’t even pretend it was
his wife with him.”
T he guests feel bound to
comme nd her, though one
sweetly innocent young wife
thinks it would have been very
■ . . . -
iaterestin S to see a P a ir of illicit
vers ca rrymg on an affair.
Kentucky sighs: ‘My,
h’ s tough when you get weather
like this right in the middle of
the season. You really can’t
expect people to come,” but here
she gallantly raises a smile,
“except people like them, who
don’t care what’s going on out-
side their bedroom.”

ENDING KOREA.
In New York “Herald Tri-
bune” leading American com-
mentator Walter Lippmann has
recorded that the Kremlin
started its Korean “peace”
manoeuvres as far back as May.
He said the Kremlin already
then was angling for an arrange-
ment that would restore the
status quo ante, but he con-
sidered it hard to see how any-
think could come of the moves
unless a basis could be found
for “a political truce between
Red China and the United
States.”
Lippmann, who contends,
against much contrary belief,
that Red China is not a mere
puppet, that the Chinese revolu-
tion is as Chinese as the French
revolution was French and the
Russian revolution was Russian,
concluded that for this reason
it would be found “very diffi-
cult to make peace with Red
China in Korea and to wage a
quasi-war with China every-
where else.”
The crux of the problem, he
holds, is Chiang Kai-shek’s
Government, in that, so long as
the U.S. recognised it, subsidised
it and armed it, “the Chinese
civil war will not have ended
and it can be transformed at any
time into a Chinese-American
war. That is the reason why
Formosa is so important... .be-
cause it is Chiang’s military base
for an invasion of China and
the overthrow of the Red Gov-
ernment.”
Lippmann may be said to
represent those Americans who
either were never very enthusi-
astic about Korea or who have
concluded that it has become
hopeless. In the same New
York paper David Lawrence
has voiced the feelings of those
still opposed to anything that
might be construed as appease-
ment. Into this category Law-
rence puts even the Truman
“peace offer,” which preceded
the open Kremlin “offer” by
more than a month. On the
Truman offer Lawrence com-
mented ;
“As the price for a so-called
‘peace,’ the attempt to unify
Korea by military means will be
given up as futile and the so-
called objectives will be sought
by diplomacy. It is a plain con-
fession of military defeat.
“Those are the main ‘peace
terms’ which President Truman
approved and sent for approval
to the other 13 Governments
represented in the United
Nations forces now fighting in
Korea. Those are the terms
that were never sent to General
MacArthur but which he un-
wittingly blocked by proposing
to the Chinese commander an
armistice on March 24 without
any such promises.
“The ‘appeasement’ can no
longer be persuasively denied. It
will, of course, be vigorously
argued that to repel aggression
was the only thing the United
Nations sought last June [1950]
and that when South Korea is
cleared of Communist forces the
objective is attained. But the
acid test is whether the aggres-
sors have really been defeated
and whether the unification of
Korea, as pledged by the U.N.,
has in fact been attained
“The announced purpose and
objective [when the American
forces were first sent into Korea]
was to punish the aggressors.
One wonders how they are to
consider themselves punished if
they get back all of North
Korea above the 38th Parallel
while our diplomats tell Mr.
Gromyko or his Red Chinese
counterpart they will agree to
another one of those ‘coalition’
Governments which eventually
handed Poland and then China
over to the Moscow Com-
munists. Is this the purpose for
which American casualties were
incurred?”
To the question “Has all the
pain and suffering, then, been
useless?” London “Daily Mail,”
for one, considers the answer is
an emphatic “No!” It finds
these crumbs of comfort;
“For the second time since
1945 the free nations have re-
sisted an act of unprovoked
aggression from the slave
nations —and that is of enor-
mous significance.
“The first occasion was when
the Russians tried to take Ber-
lin. Had that not been frus-
trated by the Anglo-American
airlift Europe might now have
been Communist.
“Similarly, had the United
Nations allowed Korea to go
by default Asia would not have
been worth a pinch of pepper
to the West. All the teeming
nations of the Orient would have
bowed the knee to Moscow.
“Having twice received
bloodied noses, the Reds may
pause before they stick their
necks out even farther. Our
sacrifices may have prevented
World War III.”
The Oil Loss.
Taking a comforting view of
the Persian oil loss, “Manchester
Guardian” has declared that,
while it “will certainly be a
great nuisance” to have to do
without it, and while “we might
have to reintroduce petrol
rationing,” there is no reason
to think that it will be
disastrous:
“Even if the company lost its
Persian sources entirely it could
probably make do from others,
though it might mean a tempor-
ary shortage in many countries
normally supplied from Persia.
“The refinery at Abadan
would be in some ways harder
to replace than the wells. It is
the biggest single refinery in the
world today, with a daily
capacity of half a million
barrels of crude oil. But re-
fineries on a smaller scale have
been going up all over the
world, particularly in the United
States and in Western Europe;
so that if Abadan stopped work
we should not be quite so
pinched as we should have been
five years ago.
“So far as Britain is concerned
the need to replace some ‘sterl-
ing oil’ by ‘dollar oil’ might be
the most pressing inconvenience.
But none of these difficulties
would bear so hardly on us or
on the company itself as the
loss of the oil revenues would
on Persia. It would be different,
of course, if the Persians were
able to take over the industry
—"South Wales Echo."
“GO EASY, SISTER—I’LL NOT ALWAYS BE MUZZLED!"
as a going concern without
foreign assistance.”
Either there is some whistling
in the graveyard about that find-
ing or else the general tenor of
recent American comments on
the loss have been oversensa-
tional. As a typical example,
American oil director Charles
L. Harding quoted in London
“Times” as lately declaring in a
speech that the loss of Persian
oil to a numerically superior
enemy “might tip the scales
against us.”
There was, he added, little
margin on which to draw if the
United States was called on sud-
denly to supply Western Europe
with the oil that formerly went
there from Persia. Thus all
programmes to build political
and industrial stability in the
world were threatened.
One definite feature of the
whole dispute has been that the
British Press generally could cer-
tainly not be accused of sabre-
rattling—rather the opposite.
London “Daily Mail” has been
one of the few to ask the Lion
for his old roar. One of its
typical comments:
“We are well aware of the
prodigious dangers lurking be-
hind the situation in Persia.
They lurked, too, in the 1930’5,
and if we had faced them boldly
we might have avoided the ulti-
mate catastrophe We say
that unless Britain is ready at
all times to protect and defend
what belongs to her, then she is
finished as a Power which counts
in the world.”
In something the same vein,
a New York “Herald Tribune”
correspondent spread blame for
weakness to his own country as
well as Britain:
“The responsible men in both
countries [Britain and U.S.]
have shirked the only real issue,
which was and is whether to
take strong measures to save
the oil. Even the British Cabinet
has only just faced this issue.
Yet the fate of the oil involves
the future of Britain as a great
Power, the control of the vital
strategic positions in the Middle
East and the whole precarious
world balance of power. Nero
at least really fiddled while
Rome burned ; but, with the fuse
steadily, visibly hissing toward
the powder-keg in Persia, both
British and American policy-
makers have mostly just fiddle-
faddled.”
P.-o.-w. of the Japs.
The House of Commons
passed, as a non-party measure,
the following motion moved by
Brigadier Smyth (Conservative):
That this House is of the opinion
that his Majesty’s Government
should give very early consideration
to the claim of the British Far Eastern
prisoners-of-war, and the dependants
of those who died in captivity, for
compensation from the Japanese
through treaty or by other methods
for the brutalities, indignities and
gross undernourishment to which
they were subjected in flagrant con-
travention of the Hague Convention,
on similar lines to the action already
taken by the United States Govern-
ment or that decided upon by the
Australian Government.
Brigadier Smyth said that the
motion stood in the names of
297 members on both sides.
They intended to hold the
Japanese responsible for the
deliberate brutality exercised on
British prisoners-of-war, as a
result of which 10,000 died in
captivity.
Mr. George Thomas (Labor)
said the claim, was for just com-
pensation for treatment which
was unparalleled in the military
history of great nations.
Mr. Low (Conservative) said
he hoped the peace treaty would
be used to show the Japanese
people as a whole that they were
responsible for the foul treat-
ment meted out to our prisoners.
Mr. H. F. L. Turner (Con-
servative), who was himself a
Jap p.-0.-w., said that he never
saw a bandage issued by any
Japanese, and they [the
prisoners] never received any
Red Cross supplies. These were
sent to the fighting Nippon
troops in Burma.
Mr. Younger (Minister of
State) spoke of the great dif-
ficulty there would be in making
such a claim effective and
actually getting compensation.
The British Government’s view
was that there was really little
chance, and it would be wrong
to encourage those concerned to
entertain false hopes.
Mr. Grimond (Labor) said he
was not satisfied with that Gov-
ernment answer, and the House
should not be discouraged by
the difficulties. There had been
ill-treatment of British prisoners
by the Japanese as an organised
policy, and the Government
should make a claim against the
Japanese and do their utmost to
enforce it.
Mr. Snow (Labor) said he did
not accept the view that the
economic capacity of Japan
would not bear some pretty
strong penal imposition. A
large part of the population of
Japan did not seem to be having
such a bad time.
Peking Kow-tow.
Save from the Communist
and Socialist party papers
Britain’s kow-tow policy to-
wards Communist China has
had, at the most, a rather waver-
ing support from the British
Press. London “Economist,” as
usual, is among the more forth-
right :
“The policy of conciliating
Peking, which was highly
dubious at the start, has never
paid a single dividend and is
now patently bankrupt.
“There may be some people
in the Foreign Office who still
cherish a faint hope of having
something other than insults to
show for so much forbearance ;
but even they cannot still main-
tain, save perhaps for obstinacy’s
sake, that the prospective gains
of the recognition policy are
other than quite microscopic in
comparison with the harm it has
done to relations with the United
States.
“It needs only an open Com-
munist threat to Hong Kong to
bring his Majesty’s Government
helter-skelter into the American
position.
“But if the change of course
waits until then, it will be far
too late for any good to be
derived from it; indeed, its only
fruit then will be deserved
mockery.”
Comic Propaganda.
In the course of a London
“Spectator” report from
Washington, Robert Waithman
has analysed the curious
phenomenon of Soviet broad-
cast and Press propaganda regu-
larly serving up such really
colossal whoppers about
America (in particular) that to
anyone outside the Curtain they
are just plain funny.
Waithman provides the most
rational explanation so far
encountered; that the propa-
ganda line behind the Iron
Curtain requires that America
must be projected as a country
where all the oppressions and
excesses, the deficiencies and
fears of life under Soviet Com-
munism occur in a much worse
form! So:
“The Soviet rulers have intro-
duced a tolerance at home of
their own sins by imputing the

same sins, magnified, to their
most dangerous adversary. Thus
the Moscow Government, which
has created 170 divisions, has
hammered into the minds of its
people the conviction that the
Washington Government, which
during most of 1950 could call
on no more than ten divisions,
is a body of mad, imperialist-
minded, greedy, conscienceless
warmongers. Thus the Moscow
Government, which has re-
morselessly manipulated the
minds of its own and its
satellites’ youth, has accused the
Washington Government of pre-
siding over (as the ‘Journal of
Soviet Pedagogy’ said) a system
designed ‘to educate obedient,
non - thinking, non - resisting
slaves of capital just as the
medieval school educated
obedient slaves of feudal
barons’....
“When two correspondents of
‘Pravda’ report back that New
York is ‘a dirty, neglected city,
its sidewalks and pavements
littered with decaying garbage,
its streets unwashed for many
months,’ the instinct of anyone
who has noted the trends is to
wonder whether there can have
been recent complaints about
the condition of the streets and
pavements of Moscow. And if
the Americans feel some scep-
ticism about the degree of con-
tentment among Soviet workers
and their ability to buy what
they see in the Moscow shops,
the Russians have themselves
encouraged such doubts. For
‘Pravda’ has said;
The stories of seamen who have
been to America paint the plight of
the workers in that country. This is
what I. A. Zadorozhny, an electrical
machinist, saw in New York: “There
are no buyers in the stores. The
stores are deserted; and it is not be-
cause people do not need clothing,
footwear and goods, but because
people have nothing to buy all this
with.” Zadorozhny told of the
terrible unemployment in America.
Some people work no more than
10 to 12 hours a week; others have
no employment; others don’t work
at jobs for which they’re qualified.
In Brooklyn decently-dressed Ameri-
cans came up to our sailors and
begged a penny for food.
“Or, again, from a broadcast
of the Soviet radio in
Hungarian:
Children are perishing by the tens
of thousands, killed by exposure,
famine and various diseases. All this
is happening in rich America, and it
is dreadful to think what is going on
in the satellite States.”
Russia’s British Jet.
London “Daily Telegraph”
comment on U.S. General Van-
denberg’s statement that “the
Russian-built MIG-15 jet-fighter
used in Korea is superior to
machines used by our allies”:
“This enemy fighter is based
upon a British Rolls-Royce en-
gine of which our present
[Attlee] Government was kind
enough to export 25 examples
to Russia in 1946 and 1947.
“The shameful imbecility of
Ministers who allowed an out-
standing British war-weapon to
be thus disposed of to the State
most likely to use it, directly or
through satellites, against us
and our friends is perhaps diffi-
cult even for those who blun-
dered at the time to understand
today.
“The Russians have improved
upon the models so obligingly
handed them five years ago, and
there is little reason to believe
that either in quantity or in
quality British fighter produc-
tion has recovered the advantage
which Ministerial folly gave
away.”
Crowded India.
Quoting India’s official census
as showing a population of
357,000,000 (exclusive of Jammu
and Kashmir), an increase of
13.4 per cent, since 1941, “Man-
chester Guardian” grimly adds:
“Every year India’s need for
food increases by half a million
tons of grain.
“For the whole country, the
density of population is 300 to
the square mile ; this is six times
as great as in the United States.
“The ever-increasing pressure
on the soil in India is the main
problem of South Asia. It is
forcing the country towards a
poverty which will probably end
in revolution.”
Even if the Colombo Plan were
carried out, it further states,
“production would still be run-
ning a losing race with popula-
tion.”
Various Voices.
Canadian Prime Minister St.
Laurent: “It may well be that
the greatest of all the dangers
we face—greater even than the
danger from Russia or from
China —is the danger of listen-
ing to those who think they have
a quick and easy solution to this
terribly difficult [West-East]
problem. There is a great temp-
tation to say; ‘Communist im-
perialism is an evil thing, bent
on extinguishing the free world.
Let us extinguish it first.’ That
temptation will grow greater as
the military strength of the free
world increases. But statesman-
ship does not consist in yielding
to impulses, however righteous,
without reckoning the conse-
quences. To hit back now at
the source of the trouble is to
start a world war, and that is
what we are trying to prevent.”
American oil director Charles
L. Harding (describing the
Persian action as abrogation of
contract rather than nationalisa-
tion); “In the world today we
are endeavoring to adopt a
higher order of conduct among
nations. We are searching for
a substitute for armed force
that has so often governed in
the past. If the civilised world
accepts without protest viola-
tion of these principles the inter-
national investment and trade
required for the economic well-
being of the people of the world
will be inhibited.”
American Lieut.-Gen. Wede-
meyer (asked at a Congress in-
quiry if he agreed that “future
peace of the world depends on
the continuation of the United
Nations”): “Yes, sir, or some
similar organisation where we
can get collective, sincere and
self-sacrificing effort on the part
of nations and peoples to
achieve collective security.”
President Truman: “For our
part, if peace could be made
sure the American people would
be glad to invest part of the re-
sources we must now allocate to
defence to a large-scale pro-
gramme of world-wide eco-
nomic development.”
Britain’s representative at the
Paris “four Power” talks,
Ernest Davies (summing - up
what happened there): “The
Russians wanted to use the con-
ference for the purpose of
undermining the Western de-
fence effort, and of trying to
divide the Western Powers. I
feel thaf, on the contrary, the
Russians have now lost hope of
doing this ; instead of weaken-
ing the West they in fact
strengthened its determination
to defend itself.”
British Fuel Minister Noel-
Baker: “If Persian supplies
were totally shut down seven-
and-a-half million tons of crude
oil and twenty-two million
tons of refined products would
be lost. But the British
companies could almost immedi-
ately find six million tons of
crude oil from other sterling
sources, and could refine eight
million tons more in other plants
throughout the world. The
actual deficit should not be more
than three or four million tons.
This might make special short-
ages in special places; it would
involve financial difficulties of
various kinds: it is a net loss
which the free world could ill
afford. But it would not mean
the swift, irreparable disaster
which some people have pre-
dicted. I do not minimise the
loss which we would suffer, but
others would make a great mis-
take if they counted on its
being more serious than I have
said.”

Your Day by the Stars.
Aries: Several bad vibrations
may be expected by those
Arians who use a rubber reduc-
ing apparatus. Avoid walking in
front of speeding double-decker
buses between 4.30 p.m. and 6
p.m. A bad day to be bitten by
a great Dane or to swallow the
backbone of a barracouta.
Your cycle will be in the ascend-
ant between 2.15 a.m. and 2.17
a.m., during which time it would
be propitious to paint a mural,
cut your toenails, grind coffee-
beans (but only if they are for
your personal use), and lay wall-
to-wall carpet.
Taurus: Avoid doing 60 m.p.h
through cross streets while over-
taking P.D. cars, playing with
live taipans and touching wires
carrying 33,000 volts before 10
a.m., when your eighth cycle,
which is favorable to your pro-
tection, comes into operation.
If a domestic argument develops
postpone it until Saturn comes
into conjunction with Venus,
when affairs concerning marriage
and love come under beneficent
influence. It would be a grave
mistake today to shave three
times, walk about with a set rat-
trap in the pocket in which you
keep loose change, or balance by
one hand on the parapet of a
250 ft. building unless the aspects
are favorable for doing these
things.
Gemini: You should avoid
contact with people today ex-
cept in crowds, streets, public
vehicles, places of amusement,
“ He's going crook —reckons the beer's flat!"
paddocks, and offices and fac-
tories. You will be completely
free of enmity from everyone ex-
cept those who bear you ill-will.
Your third cycle is auspicious.
This should occasion you great
happiness unless the handlebars
fall off or the front fork breaks.
Cancer: It would be wise to
plan your affairs so as to avoid
bankruptcy, promises of mar-
riage and betting on horses or
dogs which are not assured of
winning. Aspects extremely
favorable for tuning grand
pianos, building cyclotrons, swim-
ming rapids, charcoal-burning,
harpooning whales and conduct-
ing symphony orchestras.
Leo : You will have to be pre-
pared to be thwarted in case you
are unable to get things all your
own way today. Auspicious for
planting horse-radish, onion-
weed, water - hyacinth, broad
beans and grandfather. Allow
for delay if you intend to visit
the Taxation Department or
build a house. Take additional
care to see that heads do not
fly off any matches you strike
immediately after you have had
a gallon of petrol accidentally
spilled over you.
Virgo: Take care not to
attempt the making of home-
brew today unless you have suf-
ficient quantities of malt, hops,
yeast and sugar. Those born
under the sign of Virgo should
never take up hobbies such as
fretwork, tatting or stamp-col-
lecting, otherwise there is a grave
risk of their becoming muscle-
bound. The realisation of hopes
concerning human relations may
or may not be fulfilled, especially
after 11.50 p.m.
Libra: This is definitely not
a day for Librans to roller-
skate through the cut-glass de-
partment of one of the big city
stores, carry 601 b. tins of T.N.T.
during a blackout, take a canary
down an abandoned coalmine
(unless it is a good whistler and
will thus be able to guide rescuers
to you in case you get lost in a
tunnel), or be immediately under
a descending office safe which
has been pushed out a ninth-story
window. Also slightly unfavor-
able for buying bags of potatoes
and sugar and boxes of butter if
you are a resident of Sydney.
Scorpio: If this is the day be-
fore pay-day avoid extravagant
spending. Violinists and artists
should guard against any temp-
tations to have their heads shaved
before midday. This is your
“destiny cycle”—you may be
beneficially or adversely affected
or you may not, according to
whether the higher the fewer. It
would be prudent to avoid fall-
ing in vats of boiling fat or driv-
ing off at golf with your head up.
Saggitarius: A bad day to be
involved in a raging bushfire un-
less torrential rain happens to be
falling at the time. Aspects very
favorable for travelling in ferries
which have adequate brakes,
holding open umbrellas up
during tornadoes, pushing three-
wheeled perambulators and look-
ing at workmen digging holes.
Capricorn: Chart the course
of your affairs so that if happi-
ness comes to you today you will
be in good spirits. Especially
avoid the eating of three-course
meals between lunch and after-
noon-tea, listening-in to parlia-
mentary debates while compos-
ing sonatas, and doing ice figure-
skating unless you have previ-
ously learned to skate.
Aquarius : You would be wise
to go through the latter part of
the day without mistaking
prussic acid for antacid mixture,
casting bronzes while wearing
white tie and tails, walking
absentmindedly into the tigers’
enclosure at the Zoo, or giving
your wife £5O to go and buy her-
self a new spring outfit. Aspects
favorable for catching snapper
by trolling with a white rag on
the hooks, taking bones away
from bull-terriers and for ships’
firemen working in celluloid
collars.
Pisces: Your third house
focuses attention on the need to
avoid the inconvenience of
power blackouts, hay-fever, buy-
ing hats. three sizes too small,
sleeping along the pillows, ex-
ploring the craters of active vol-
canoes, testing the efficiency of
steam hammers with your wrist-
watch and wrestling with 30ft.
anacondas.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT’S
RED MILL RUM.
The prodigal son, or, rather, a
complete contingent of expatriates,
returned to their native heath to make
the outcome of Saturday’s Doomben
Ten Thousand a one hundred per cent,
triumph for local talent. Although
Queensland-bred, and owned by
Q.T.C. committeeman E. E. D.
White, the Ten Thousand winner,
Coniston, had been resident for some
months previously in Sydney, where
he had his sole public preparatory
run for the Ten Thousand. In Syd-
ney he was prepared by former
Queensland trainer H. Plant, and in
the big race Coniston was ridden by
former Queensland jockey N. Mc-
Growdie.
A pleasing, and, in the light of past
experience, surprising feature of this
year’s Ten Thousand was that it was
a very cleanly-run race, with no sign
of the scrambling, brawling, fair-
means-or-foul riding that has been
unpleasantly noticeable in previous
runnings of the rich sprint. True,
unhappily for punters, the hot favorite
Warrah King fell in the straight, but
that was a pure accident.
Actually the favorite looked to be
beaten when he fell. He had been
prominent most of the way, but ap-
peared to be weakening when he
evidently clipped another runner and
came down. At that time the race
had resolved into a struggle between
Deep Sea and Coniston, with one or
two others finishing well, but too late.
Deep Sea was in front for a brief
space, but Coniston had him fairly
collared with 50 yards to go, and
went on to win by a length.
The most spectacular performance
of the piece was turned in by Davey
Jones, who finished third. The New
Zealand colt played up at the start,
missed the jump and trailed the field
in the early stages, but he eventually
came with a brilliant burst to pip
Field Boy for the minor money,
three-parts of a length behind Deep
Sea. While a trainer who has won
the Sydney premiership for three suc-
cessive seasons may be presumed to
know his onions, it must be
remarked that the McCarten-trained
Davey Jones has twice now appeared
to have been beaten in a big race
mainly because he was short of a
gallop. That, at all events, was the
expressed opinion of his rider, W.
Cook, and of others after the three-
year-old had been beaten a head m
the Doncaster at what was only nis
second start in Australia; and Satur-
day’s run in the Ten Thousand was
his first since the Doncaster. In tne
circumstances it was a splendid per-
formance for a three-year-old carrying
top weight.
As far as concerned recent racing
experience Coniston was actually little
better equipped than Davey Jones.
Coniston had contested a Flying at
Randwick on May 5, but that had
been his only run since last November.
Coniston is a three-year-old brown
colt by St. Constant from Ballet St.
Constant is probably best remembered
as the horse which, to quote this page
at the time, “Alan Cooper sold to
Joe Cook for a measly simoleon m
a ’fit of chagrin” ; but he was, as well,
a really good, if somewhat unlucky,
performer. St. Constant won the
Cantala Stakes and a swag ot other
good races, finished second in the
Breeders’ Plate and the Caulfield Cup
and third in the Epsom (twice) and
Doncaster.
* * * *
If results at Flemington on Satur-
day can be taken as any indication
of what is in store in coming weeks
followers of the jumping game might
be best advised to cut their losses
and head north—a long way
north —for the remainder of the
winter. The success of Rebel Regis
in the Keilor Hurdle was not so bad,
since the Lyme Regis gelding started
second favorite at threes, but the
Grand National Hurdle went to
Hefty Loon at 50 to 1 and the Ken-
sington Steeple to Jung Bahadur at
16 to 1. Still, it’s an ill wind; the
Hefty Loon-Jung Bahadur double
must have come as a really purple
patch for the J, Jury stable, which
houses Both.
With his previous successes con-
fined to a couple of very minor pro-
vincial hurdle races (and with a name
like his in any case), Hefty Loon was
practically the rank outsider for the
National, his only opponent for that
title being Historic, who, as it hap-
pened, was also the only horse to
fall. For the first two miles of the
three-miles journey the field was
pretty close-bunched, and the solid
pace maintained on the heavy track
took its toll of the more heavily-
weighted brigade, which embraced
most of the fancied runners. Russian
Boy did a fair deal of the pacemaking,
and one or two others had each their
brief glory at the head of the field,
but Euripides was the leader as they
turned for home. At that stage it
seemed that if there was to be any
challenge it was scarcely likely to
emanate from Hefty Loon, who had
half-a-dozen in front of him. Foxen
looked the real danger. However,
hard-ridden, Hefty Loon finished very
gamely, well out in the centre of the
track, to score by a neck from Foxen,
with Euripides half-a-length away
third. Favorite The Feline finished
quite a close fourth; he didn’t seem
to get going properly again after being
involved in a scrimmage near the
mile, and he badly blundered the last
jump.
The mount on Hefty Loon was a
lucky last-minute fluke engagement
for young South Australian rider R.
Holt, who made the trip principally
to ride Burling in Saturday’s Ken-
sington Steeple and next Saturday’s
Grand National. However, Holt had
to waste very severely to get even
within 31b. of Hefty Loon’s allotted
9.1, and he was in a pretty pitiful
state after the race. He had to be
helped from the saddle (it was really
a miracle that gravity had not per-
formed this office earlier) and a
steward had to carry his saddle to the
scale. It was Holt’s first ride at
Flemington, and was one which,
for divers reasons, he’ll doubtless
remember.
Hefty Loon, who is raced by A. N.
Payne, is a six-year-old brown gelding
by Caledon from Kate Marlow. He
was given his odd name because it
seemed a pretty precise description of
the big. ungainly and clumsy colt he
was. He did not race until he was
pretty well into his fourth year, and
then, having demonstrated in the
course of four attempts at country
meetings that he was incapable of
beating even the poorest company on
the flat, he was turned at once to
hurdling. During the remainder of
his four-year-old season nine runs,
first in the metropolis, but gradually
receding into the hinterland, saw
Hefty Loon still struggling in vain to
finish even within shooting distance
of the placegetters in jumping events.
However, Saturday’s Grand National
victory stands as a shining example
of what can (sometimes) be achieved
with sufficient perseverance.
The success of Jung Bahadur in the
Kensington Steeple, apart from com-
pleting a choice stable double on the
day, raised in trainer J. Jury high
hopes of also bringing off the Grand
Nationals double. And that is far
from being wishful thinking. Last
year Jung Bahadur, after a thrilling
struggle from the final fence to the
post, was beaten only a length by
Parilla’s Pride. This year Jung
Bahadur seems nicely in the National
with 10.1. He won Saturday’s race
quite stylishly by a length from
Repeater, with Grey Gull third and
Burling a far-distant fourth; among
the half-dozen also-rans were the
highly-fancied Grand National quar-
tette Llandrillo, Worrowing, Niblik
and Bronze Laddie.
Winners on the flat at Flemington
represented a mixed bag. Giving W.
Williamson his 50th winner of the
season, Clutha started favorite for the
12-furlongs July Handicap, and won
comfortably from Hoyle. Another
generally-popular result was the suc-
cess of Lucky Mascot (R. Heather),
who started equal favorite for the
first division of the mile Braybrook
Handicap. On the other side of the
ledger were the successes of Bright
Law (E. Sellers) at 16 to 1 in the
second Braybrook and of Friar’s
Hope at tens in the Myross Handicap,
a 6-furlongs scramble contested by
37 two-year-olds.
Jockey R. Heather seems to strike
more strife than anybody could pos-
sibly really deserve. Just back from
a lengthy absence enforced by his
breaking both wrists in a fall. Heather
must have thought it a welcome turn
of the tide when he scored on Lucky
Mascot and Friar’s Hope on Satur-
day, but he was soon disillusioned:
two months for “careless riding” on
Lucky Mascot.
* * * *
Pretty well everyone connected with
the game would like to see jockey
Arthur Ward win the Sydney premier-
ship this season, including, we faintly
suspect, his only near rival for the
title, W. Cook. At all events Cook
was away riding Davey Jones at
Doomben on Saturday, and Ward, at
Canterbury, made hay and play while
the sun shone and the wily feline
was away.
Ward began the day three wins
behind Cook’s tally of 39, but, land-
ing a skilful treble, he drew level
with the erstwhile leader, and, such
are the wonders of modern transport,
concluded the day by chewing a bone
with Cook in Brisbane. Actually,
Ward might have established a handy
lead on Saturday had he not en-
countered an unexpected snag in the
shape of apprentice A. Whiteman,
whose mounts twice nudged his into
second place.
Ward opened the day by winning
the Consolation Stakes for two-year-
old fillies on Cornell and a similar
event for colts and geldings on
Edward, an amusingly named son of
the imported sire Confessor. Ward
then encountered Whiteman, who, on
San Domenico’s brother Video,
downed Ward’s mount, the hot
favorite Iroquois, in the first Ashbury
Mixed. Ward enjoyed temporary
revenge when, on Barrymore, he
downed Blandstream, ridden by
Whiteman, in the 11-furlongs Campsie
Mixed; but Whiteman quickly
retaliated by riding Valroy out well
to down Grey Theo, with Ward up,
in the Welter.

Wimbledon, 1951, was simply
Wimbledon, 1950, and, for that
matter, most other post-war Wimble-
dons, all over again. An Australia-
America men’s singles final, with the
American again too good. Aus-
tralians affirming their long-undisputed
supremacy in the men’s doubles. A
complete American domination of the
women’s events, and, with Australian
partners, of the mixed doubles. What
a pity it is that there are no mixed
doubles, and only one men’s doubles,
in a Davis Cup round; otherwise Aus-
tralia might hold the Cup till Dooms-
day.
An interesting feature of the
Wimbledon title was that, with the
cream of players from all countries
engaged, it produced the same final-
ists and the same result as the last
Australian championships. Sedgman
unexpectedly failed at Wimbledon,
and McGregor just as unexpectedly
battled his way through to meet the
American, Savitt, in the final, as he
had done in the Australian champion-
ship. Savitt won 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.
Before the Davis Cup challenge
round comes up Australian tennis
authorities, and players, should in-
dulge in a spot of earnest soul-
searching for an explanation of the
very significant fact that in the six
Wimbledon championships played
since the war four different Aus-
tralians have reached the final, and
each been then beaten.
Sedgman and McGregor won the
men’s doubles, beating Drobny and
the S’African, Sturgess, 3-6, 6-2, 6-3,
3-6, 6-3. The American girl, Doris
Hart, took the three women’s titles,
a result which would be greeted with
loud cheers by all Australian fans, for
the Hart lass made herself extremely
popular on her couple of visits to
these parts. Miss Hart downed
fellow-American Shirley Fry in the
singles, partnered Miss Fry to take
the doubles and partnered Sedgman
to win the mixed doubles from the
Australian pair, M. Rose and Mrs.
Bolton.

All sorts of strange things are hap-
pening in Melbourne football. In a
remarkable season Hawthorn, not
satisfied with having broken all pre-
vious records by winning two games,
had the effrontery to down Fitzroy in
Saturday’s “split round.” Only 10,000
went to ’Roy to see it, and until the
last spasm it looked like a ’Roy vic-
tory. Then Hawthorn astounded
themselves and everybody else by
turning on the real stuff, and got there
by a point, 11.9-10.14. Thirty thou-
sand went to Essendon, where the
rejuvenated Dons got a grip on Rich-
mond Tigers, and hung on to win,
10.14 to 10.10, giving the Dons a
slap at the “four.” Geelong came
to M.C.G. and ran all over Mel-
bourne in the last quarter for 12.12-
7.7. It puts Geelong on top, Colling-
wood next, then Fitzroy, with Rich-
mond, Footscray and Essendon shar-
ing fourth place, though Richmond
has the edge on percentages.
Fresh from an easy win over W.A.
at Perth, the Vic. Aussie Rules tour-
ists encountered S.A. in Adelaide on
Saturday. Rain fell most of the time,
which ought to have pleased the Vic-
torians, but Williams (Port Adelaide
rover) and the S.A. backs between
them overhauled a 31-point lead, and
the Croweaters prevailed, 8.11 to 8.5.

“Pass-it”: At Sydney Cricket
Ground on Saturday Australia lost
the second Rugby Union Test, and
with it the Bledisloe Cup, when it
went down to New Zealand, 11-17.
Australia had every opportunity to
win the match, and at one stage in
the second half led 11-9, but the All
Blacks finished very strongly, and
there was little doubt about their
complete superiority at the end of the
day’s play. In looking for the causes
of our defeat one could certainly not
blame the forwards, who, playing
against a traditionally strong pack,
did even better than was expected of
them, and provided ample oppor-
tunities for their backs. It was here
that Australia disappointed: unac-
countably the backs lost confidence
in their ability to attack with the
ball, and, generally, approached their
task with a negative and defensive
outlook. The All Blacks proved a
solid combination. Outstanding among
them, as he has been throughout the
tour, was winger Jarden; he has
stamped himself clearly one of the
finest wingers ever sighted here. Both
in defence and attack Jarden was an
inspiration to his team: in fact he
was the eight points difference between
the two teams.

Max Faulkner, who was out here
for the last McWilliams’ Wines
£2500 tourney, took the British Open

tralian was Peter Thomson (293);
Von Nida tore up his card.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Sydney Ram Sales.
“Bungaree”: Most of the top-
notch studs found good compe-
tition for their best sheep, but
buyers were inclined to dis-
criminate. One or two of the
biggest studs had difficulty in
getting bids, and sheep after
sheep was passed in. The less-
renowned studs fared badly, and
many offerings failed to raise a
bid.
Still, excellent prices were
obtained for outstanding sheep
of fashionable breeding. Wah-
woon and Burrabogie raised a
sparkle with drafts of big, deep-
bodied rams with dense wool
packed on them. Strathdarr
(Q.) paid 2000 and lOOOgns., and
two other rams reached 1150
and lOOOgns. Boonoke made
the excellent average of
975gns. for four special studs.
Fine- and superfine - wool
rams seldom bring as much as
strong wools at Sydney; this
year they sold reasonably well.
Merryville had good averages,
their champion superfine ram
making top price of lOOOgns.
Prices improved considerably
on the second day. Most of the
tops were in this sale, and there
was more life in the bidding.
Dalgety’s sale constituted a
record for one company by ob-
taining £88,268 for 321 sheep.
Haddon Rig set the pace with
eight special studs; seven
reached four figures, including
two at 2800 and 2600gn5., and
the group averaged 1550gns.
Bundemar passed last year’s
auction record of 3400gns. (made
by Uardry) and set a new
record at 4000gns. —which may
stand for a long time. The ram
was a splendid sheep, and was
bought by Yarraldool (N.S.W.).
Another ram in this group
brought 2400gns. and the five
averaged 2100gns.
Divergence of opinion be-
tween studmasters and buyers
was pronounced at times and
hard to follow. A stud’s specials
would bring reasonable prices.
Then . would come ordinary
studs, and frequently one of
them would be boosted up to
four or five times the price of
the specials. It may have been
that two buyers wanted the
same sheep, but it is hard to
see what makes a stud ram
worth 2500gns. when his loftier
brethren, the special studs,
bring a maximum of 650gns.
The market remained firm,
and studs to notch four figures
were Austin Wanganella (2200),
Wanganella Estate (1000),
Burrabogie (2500 and 1600),
Uardry (2700, 1600 and 1000)
and Bungaree (1600 and 1500).
Thirty rams made lOOOgns. or
more, and £219,316 was realised
for 1218 sheep—a record, as
was the average of £lBO a head.
Defects and weaknesses noted
in some studs in the past now
seem to be widespread through-
out their sheep, and correction
is a major task. Bad backs,
tight horns, unevenness in fleece
quality and staple length, bad
hocks and overshot jaws were
evident at the sales. Plain
bodies were the rule, but there
were exceptions, usually among
top sheep. Burra bogie and
Wahwoon showed most develop-
ment in their rams. One ram
had an apron that reached to
the ground and must have
interfered with his walking and
serving. Black spots on the nose
appear to be general in some
flocks, though there are breeders
to whom they are anathema.
A feature was the interest in
polled Merino rams. Boonoke
offered 31—some very nice
sheep. Polls are going through
the same phases as did polled
Shorthorn and Hereford cattle
over a decade ago. With in-
creasing numbers and heavier
culling standards are improv-
ing, and they are emerging as
a more even type than might
have been considered possible
in the time.
Most of the polls had small
scurrs, but a number were true
polls. They ranged from strong
to fine-medium, and fleeces
showed a great improvement.
Top price was 850gns. Specials
averaged 238gns. and studs
ITOgns. A steady increase in
popularity of Merino polls is
inevitable.
South Australia was repre-
sented by Koonoona, Strad-
brooke, Somme Brae, Belcunda,
Bungaree and North Bungaree,
with usual drafts of big-framed,
extra strong - woolled rams,
most of which brought good
prices, though some were hard
to sell. Bungaree averaged
1066gns. for three rams, the
only S.A. sheep to hit four
figures, and the Koonoonas sold
well.
Some Riverina studs sent
huge sheep. Wonga rams, long
noted for their size, seemed
bigger than ever. Mungadal
had some big rams, and the
Wahwoons, while not so high to
the wither, made up for it by
their great depth.
Demand for rams is a long
way ahead of supplies. It’s to
be hoped studmasters will keep
up their standards. There were
a lot of sheep at the sales that
appeared to be out of their
grade, and some that should
have been culled.
CORRIEDALE SALES
There was a ready market for
good sheep from established
studs, but for anything else the
going was tough. Studmasters
prepared to meet the market
sold all their sheep at auction.
Others failed to sell a single
ram.
Best clearance and best aver-
age were recorded by M. Carroll
and Son, of Redbank, Molong,
whose four special studs sold
at 510, 310, 300 and 150gns.
Other good prices were 400gns.
for a Neyliona ram and 275gns.
for a Guthrie. Few of the studs
had their usual strong teams ;
most of them are able to sell
their rams in the paddock.
British Breeds
British breeds sales w'ere a
complete flop. Withdrawals
were heavy. G. Starritt and
Sons (Vic.) withdrew all their
offerings and of the remainder
the big majority were passed in.
Of 44 Border Leicesters cata-
logued 11 were sold at prices
ranging from 27{gns. to 125gns.
and averaging about 53gns.
No Southdowns were sold.
Out of 27 Dorsets offered only
seven were sold at auction.
Lindsbury sheep sold at 185gns.,
with other sales at 135 and
120gns., but the only other stud
to break the ice was Maryle-
bone.
Only one breeder offered
Romneys, H. W. Yelland (Vic.),
and he did not do well. His
reserves were fairly high, and of
the seven rams put up only two
were sold—at 140 and 280gns.
—the latter being the top price
for British-breed sales. One
Suffolk ram was offered, but
failed to bring a satisfactory
figure.
Care in Breeding.
“Shadow-chaser”: Recently I
saw it stated that, as the female
determined the size of her off-
spring, large breeds such as
Shorthorns could be safely
mated with small breeds such as
Jerseys. This runs counter to
experience.
A local (Vic.) dairyman joined
a Shorthorn bull with a herd of
20 Jersey heifers. Result was
eight difficult births needing
assistance and three impossible
ones resulting in death.
With sheep, too, it is unwise
to mate young Merino ewes
with large breeds of rams like
Border Leicester, Dorset Horn
or Romney Marsh, although it
can be safely done with three-
year-olds and over.
When selecting rams of any
large breed it is advisable to
n
j]jj ,

choose the finer-headed indi-
viduals. This applies particularly
to all the Down’s breeds. And,
if required for maiden ewes, dis-
card the heavy-shouldered types
in favor of their lighter-
shouldered brethren. Often the
shepherd finds a ewe in trouble
with the head safely born and
the lamb choked because of the
heavy shoulders so popular in
many long-wooled breeds.
Too Eager to Kill.
“M.U.R.”: The inevitable
chump with a rifle downed a
wedge-tail in our southern
N.S.W. district the other day by
pegging out a White Leghorn
pullet on a bit of open plain
and himself lying under a bag
until wedgy dropped within
range.
There was the usual talk
about the spread of the wings
and the alleged damage the big
bird must have caused, and a
lot of people slept easier at
night and the destroyer was
hailed as a mighty hunter before
the Lord.
I’d have liked to have kicked
him before he pulled the trigger.
He probably knew nothing of
the habits or diet of the wedgy
and believed all the absurd
charges made against the
splendid flyer by thoughtless
land men who ought to know
better and hysterical newspaper
reporters who’ll swallow any-
thing.
It’s a regrettable aspect of our
national character that the
moment some native bird or
animal appears somebody wants
to rush out and murder it. The
same attitude towards trees has
brought us untold losses, and
we’re losing also through wanton
destruction of native fauna.
Insect Pests of Stock.
The article (B.
4/7/ ’5l) was timely, and, if read
in conjunction with “Fogging
with D.D.T. and B.H.C. for the
Control of Sheep Lice and Ked”
in the May issue of the N.S.W.
“Agricultural Gazette,” throws
a light on the whole urgent
question of protecting livestock
against insect pests.
According to reliable figures
over 1,500,000 sheep were
fogged last year. It is a great
pity that stock-inspectors’ re-
ports from areas in which those
sheep were treated were not
THE WEATHER
By Inigo Jones
For most of Australia July and August do not present
much prospect of rains of importance, but along the
southern littoral there should be good seasonal rains from
Leeuwin to Gabo and up into the N.S.W. South Coast.
There is a possible blow on the C.Q. coast, with some
heavy rains round Bowen and Mackay, and then sweeping
south, but with only moderate rains as far as the Hunter.
This storm, however, is not certain. The next general rain
seems to be in September.

assessed as to the effect on the
insect population. The relatively
small test round which the
“Gazette” article was written is
inconclusive.
But even that small test may
have provided something con-
structive if the article had not
been generally non-committal.
Apparently time and money
have been spent for no object,
for the opening paragraph
states “The trial did not provide
a definite conclusion concerning
the value of fogging against
sheep ked.”
Object of the test was to find
out the value of fogging, yet
there is no suggestion of repeat-
ing the tests. There are over
100 privately - owned fogging
machines in the country whose
owners would be prepared to
carry on the good work, but if
I were an owner I should think
twice before fogging any prized
stock when I am presented with
such statements as the follow-
ing: “Whilst no sheep were par-
ticularly distressed by either
treatment in this trial, other ex-
perience has shown that some
deaths can occur from fogging.
The circumstances under which
fogging can kill have not been
fully explored.”
Fogging machines have been
in use for nearly four years, and
both the C.5.1.R.0. and the
Department of Agriculture have
had ample time to test every
aspect of fogging. Yet, at this
late date, the question of the
dangers of fogging “have not
been fully explored”!
While much has been written
on the details of the trial, one
detail, without which a true
assessment could not possibly be
made, has been omitted ; viz, the
amount of formulation used in
each test. The article states:
“The B.H.C. treatment was
markedly superior to the D.D.T.
treatment....” The former, we
are told, consisted of 2 p.c.
gamma isomer B.H.C. and the
latter of 10 p.c. D.D.T.
According to the scientists
0.5 p.c. B.H.C. is equivalent to
5 p.c. D.DT. Therefore, 2 p.c.
8.H.C., on that basis, would
represent 20 p.c. D.D.T., which
may possibly explain the
superiority of the B.H.C. (in the
tests) over the D.D.T.
Another point is that the
selected particle size in the tests
was 60 microns. The minute
particles of the chemicals
carried in a fog of that small
droplet size take several hours
to settle. Therefore, subjecting
the animals to fogging in an
enclosed space, such as a tent,
is not only unnecessary but
dangerous and causes undue
distress to the stock while adding
nothing to the success of the
operation.
On “dipping” the “Gazette”
article states: “The successful
eradication of lice and ked is
largely dependent upon the
selection of an efficient dip
preparation and its correct use.”
Herein, I believe, lies the crux
of the question. The efficacy of
the chemicals cannot be dis-
puted, and the fault must there-
fore lie in the formulations
and/or their method of applica-
tion. Thus everything points to
the necessity for tests on the
lines suggested in the “M.0.L.”
article.
Lea Farming.
“Myrrhee”: The system,
broadly, is one in which periods
under fertility-building clover-
grass pastures are alternated with
periods of cereal cropping. In
the Victorian 20in. to 25in. rain-
fall zone sub. clover is the most
suitable legume to include in
the pasture, while Barrel medic
is worth a trial in drier districts.
B. F. McKeon, B.Agr.Sc., con-
siders that fallowing prior to the
cereal crop isn’t necessary under
conditions similar to those at
Rutherglen Research Station
(22in. rainfall), but in drier dis-
tricts fallow in the rotation is
advisable.
Grazing of livestock and the
return of animal organic matter
to the soil is an important aspect
of the lea system, and the clover
pasture permits an increased
stock-carrying capacity com-
pared with natural volunteer
pasture.
Potato Scab.
“Rooster”: Regarding its
prevention (B. 20/6/’51); I have
for many years adopted the
system of dipping all my seed in
a weak solution of corrosive
sublimate (4oz. dissolved in two
pints of commercial concen-
trated hydrochloric acid diluted
in 25gal. of water). You need
a permit to use it. It is very
toxic, and the more dangerous
by reason of the lack of color,
taste and smell. A 25gal.
preparation suffices for a ton of
seed, the chemicals costing about
10s.
Use a wooden barrel for the
solution and protect the hands
with rubber gloves. Dip each
tray and leave submerged for
10 minutes, extending the
intervals of time gradually as
the solution becomes weaker.
To obviate awkwardness in dip-
ping use a light overhead block
and tackle.
The eelworm does, of course,
flourish in soil which is over-
alkaline —hence the advice not
to lime potato land. They don’t
appear to thrive in broken-up or
turned -in pastures. That's
another point in favor of rota-
tional cropping. “Hortus” gives
a good lead with the rape-
growing curtain-raiser, however,
and it’s worth a trial, although
scab is not so much a potato
disease as a potato-peel dis-
figurement ; the quality of the
tuber remains as you were.
Establishing Lucerne.
“Sundowner”: Manuring is
important. A good mixture is
equal parts of reverted super,
and carbonate of lime at 3cwt.
per acre, sown with the seed,
but if the paddock has not been
limed prior to sowing apply a
ton per acre.
Rate of sowing varies between
51b. to 101 b. an acre in drier
areas to 161 b. in wet. If broad-
cast, the rate should be slightly
increased. Sow on a shallow
seed-bed and lightly cover with
a harrow. Cutting in the first
year may be necessary to reduce
weed growth. In haymaking,
cut when the lucerne is still in
the tender growing stage.
With ordinary care a stand
should last six years. Annual
dressings of lime and super, will
help check weeds. Apply the
dressing immediately after the
first cut each season, lOcwt. of
lime and lewt. of super, an
acre.
Lucerne likes irrigation, and
production may be trebled if it
is available. However, care must
be exercised with drainage, or
weeds will get out of hand and
parts of the stand may be
drowned.
Hints for the Farm.
“Mr.”: As a precaution
against arthritis in lambs erect
temporary marking-yards on
fresh ground each year and
keep instruments scrupulously
clean, dipping them in a solu-
tion of lysol (one teaspoonful
to a pint of water) after each
operation. Sluice down the
marking-board frequently with
the same solution and keep the
hands disinfected. Lambing
ewes should be put on to clean,
well - sheltered paddocks and
never allowed to lamb-down on
old camps. Annual rotation of
lambing paddocks is a help,
“C.AA.”: Manganese is pre-
sent j n only minute quantities in
mos t poultry foodstuffs, but is
essential to ensure higher hatch-
ability. If bran and pollard
form a considerable part of the
ration supplementing the diet is
unnecessary. Where manganese
j s required, feed at 4oz.

Skim milk! She was a pig
farmer’s El Dorado.
We all drank so much of it
now that our tongues got tired
lapping it up. Fat! The whole
tribe of us were bursting the
nails out of our trousers and
putting on condition hourly.
We felt so fit and terrible that
my young brothers conquered
all males at school and my
sisters had three boys each. As
for myself, I hang my head with
modesty.
And Lady’s nature was
kindly; became one of us, a
member of the family; used to
walk into our kitchen for a
yarn; used to take a short-cut
through our house and some-
times on a very hot day liked to
just stand in our shady drawing-
room and chew the cud with us.
Her calf was a quiet young
heifer, too ; no rampageous con-
duct to get to its mother; no
pile-driving tactics to make
Lady let her milk down ; just
shoved its tongue out and
calmly sucked away like a
blacksmith’s bellows and, with
its flat tongue well out under the
teat, seemed to say “Yeth, thith
ith tho nithe!” as it sucked.
The calf was the color of tan
boot-polish, well-groomed look-
ing and with swathes of hair
licked by its mother, as mothers
brush their little girls’ hair,
which always reminded me of
how the young coves round
about combed their hair back
with soap to keep it in position
before going to the Briar Flat
dance on Saturday night; and
I’d grin to myself and think of
Ab Nuttsberry who gave up the
soap and did his hair with butter
to give it a more glossy and
captivating look, but had to give
up using butter when some of
the girls complained that he re-
minded them of the dairy, and
that when they went to a dance
they wanted to get away from
their everyday life, and not be
reminded of making butter every
time they had a dance with him.
Ab gave up the butter and
switched over to machine-oil.
BUT getting back to Lady,
we were proud of her and
looked after her —hot mash now
and then—and sometimes when
she’d be grazing on the road-
side in front of our place it was
nothing to see people pull up
and look admiringly at her, and
one day a man drew up and,
after asking if she was our cow,
asked us to bail her up for him,
he wanted to examine her; he
was an inspector.
When I bailed Lady up at
this unusual hour, by her looks,
she couldn’t understand it and
might have been asking “Is this
constitutional?”
As for Mum and I, we both
stood as still as sticks and look-
ing like the wreck of the
Hesperus as we watched him
examining her. When he’d
finished he said he’d have to
take the cow away for further
examination, and if the cow was
suffering from the disease he had
in mind, she would have to be
destroyed.
Bustling about in an officious
manner, as if taking a cow away
from its owners, to be destroyed
maybe, was an everyday affair,
he got a rope and, saying we’d
hear further from him, led Lady
away. The calf followed, and
so Mum plucked enough
courage to ask would he be tak-
ing the calf as well, and his
reply to this was that the calf
might also have to be destroyed.
“Is it a very serious disease?”
Mum asked in a respectful but
crestfallen manner.
But the inspector would not
actually reply to this question,
as if (as we thought) not wish-
ing to cast us down any more ;
but by his evident evasion of it
we read that things were real
bad.
So Mum came again, still re-
spectful, but this time with a
note of dread in her voice, and
asked would what the cow
might be suffering from have
any ill effects on us. But on this
point, too, the inspector would
not commit himself either, and
left us all steering a swift,
straight and sad voyage to the
doldrums.
Off he went, then, with Lady
mooing, which sounded like
she’d be seeing her solicitors,
while the whole tribe of us lined
up on the roadside, like con-
demned prisoners, as if waiting
for a firing-squad to come along
and finish us all off.
And now the dreary wait
began. We felt strange stir-
rings within us and every now
and then we’d adjourn to the
bedroom mirror to look at our-
selves and, as one would retire
from such an inspection, pass
the other one coming in on the
same errand. Of an evening we
sat and stared at each other to
see which one of us would be
taken first in the event of . . .
Mum wrote to Uncle Paul
about the inspector’s visit, and
voiced her fears; and he wrote
back not to worry, everything
would be all right. Being a
humorist he asked Mum not to
forget to send him invitations
to all our funerals.
And no word from the in-
spector yet.
Time dragged on and, with still
no word coming, fresh suspected
symptoms popped up among us
and most of us passed away
several times daily.
Two weeks and no word from
the inspector! It was all up!
They’d destroyed Lady all right!
Otherwise she’d have been
brought back! We’d be getting
official notification any day
now!
We didn’t, so we wrote to
Uncle to make inquiries—while
we were all still alive.
He did, and came and told us
that he wouldn’t be attending
our funerals after all.
We crowded in on him.
“I knew there couldn’t be any-
thing wrong with such a cow!”
he said triumphantly. “I knew
it all the time! Noth-
ing wrong with her!”
We pressed in on him
and a great flood of re-
lief came over us all.
You could almost hear
a huge accumulative
sigh of relief waft itself
off into the scrub.
“Nothing wrong with
her!” we all echoed.
We were healthy
again; strong again; terrible
again ; loving again.
“Well,” said Mum, “now the
inspector will soon bring Lady
back again and we’ll have all
the milk and cream and butter
we used to have.”
“But I haven’t told you the
rest yet,” said Uncle. “You
won’t be getting her back again.”
“Now, Uncle!” we all
laughed, shaking our fingers at
him, and Mum said. “None of
your funny business, Paul!”
“He wasn’t an inspector,” said
Paul. “He was a thief. He
stole her and the calf. There’s
no knowing where they are
now.”

Is neck, belly and shoulder wool
included in the fleece of a sheep ?
The fleece portion comprises the
back and surrounding area after the
fleece has been skirted. It does not
include the belly. Proportion of fleece
to skirtings varies at discretion of
classer. In some cases the neck por-
tion may be removed or lightly
skirted, the bulk of it remaining with
the fleece. Shoulder wool, with the
exception of trimmings from the fore-
legs, invariably remains part of the
fleece; it is the best wool.

(1) Largest number of stands in one
woolshed in Queensland ? (2) Greatest
number of sheep shorn in any shed in
one season in any part of Australia?
(1) Largest number was at Thurul-
goona, where 78 stands of shearing
machinery were installed in 1891.
Bowen Downs had 70 stands installed
in the same year. These were not the
largest in Australia, as two sheds in
N.S.W., Burrawang and Mahonga,
had 88 stands each installed in 1890.
(2) A number of properties in Queens-
land and N.S.W. lay claim to the
record, but various factors affect their
claims. Some properties shore in one .
shed while others had two or three
sheds on the property. On the data
available no particular claim could be
definitely accepted as the record.

Particulars of Parkinson’s disease ?
Nothing is certainly known of its
cause. It is rare before the age of 40,
and from then on its frequency
increases. The disease may take 10
years or more to run its course unless
some other illness, such as pneumonia,
supervenes. No treatment has any
influence upon the progress of the
malady, but relief is obtained from
administration of hyocine hydro-
bromide or atropine sulphate under
medical supervision. Pain and sleep-
lessness have to be treated as they
occur. In the later stages, owing to
the patient’s inability to move freely,
careful nursing is essential.

How to sharpen a scythe? Is car-
borundum or sandstone the better
sharpening stone?
With handle of scythe on ground
hold scythe at heel end and rub hone
alternately left and right, side to side.
The hone should sweep each side of
the blade as a razor is sharpened on
a strop, except that process is reversed
and hone is the moving instrument.
Sandstone does a good job; car-
borundum gives an edge that lasts
longer.

Short account of Francis Birtles’s
wanderings ?
Francis Birtles died on July 11,
1941. He helped to open up outback
Australia by means of cycle, motor
transport and aviation; he covered
500,000 miles in overlanding trips,
and was across and around Aus-
tralia 88 times, He pioneered the
Fremantle-to-Sydney motor route in
1912; the east coast of Australia
motor route, 1912-13; the Adelaide-
Gulf of Carpentaria motor route in
1914; and the England-Australia
motor-car route via Europe and
Singapore, 1927. He cycled twice
around Australia, in 1907 and 1910,
and held numerous trans-Australian
cycle and car records. In 1921 he
made the pioneer aerial exploration
of Central Australia.

Are objects seen through the eye-
piece of a theodolite meant to appear
upside down ? If so, why ?
The simplest form of telescope in
common use consists of only two
lenses, an objective and an eyepiece.
This arrangement produces an upside-
down image. If it is necessary to
see objects the right way up, as in a
sailor’s telescope, it is necessary to
use two more lenses in the middle of
the instrument to invert the image
again. This means that the instru-
ment has to be longer and heavier
than before. For some purposes it
does not matter if the image is upside
down, as in astronomy or surveying.
Hence the theodolite shows an in-
verted image.

Directions for making candles?
Clarify mutton fat by boiling it in
water. Allow to cool, cut out fat
and scrape all discoloration from
underside, then boil again in water.
When hot, add to each 11b. of clean
fat, loz. powdered alum; stir well,
and then use for candles. Lacking
alum, add £lb. resin to 11b. fat,
melting both together. Make moulds
by cutting strips of thick brown paper
the length of a candle, roll them
round pipe or cylinder the size of a
candle and gum the edges. Close one
end of each with cardboard. Sus-
pend cotton wicks above moulds, and
fill with the hot fat. A drop or two
of kerosene will improve the fat.
Leave till cold. Best not used for a
week.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
per line; all others 2£d. per line.
P.M.G. Troubles
Socialist notions (B. 20/6/’5l) aren’t
the only causes of the ills that afflict the
P.M.G.’s Department. As long ago as
1938, with the introduction of the system
of linemen-, technicians- and engineers-
in-training, many then middle-aged and
capable men with as much as 20 years’
service were consigned to the shelf as far
as their future advancement was con-
cerned.
Under that particular system, youths
in large numbers were enlisted, given two
to five years’ theoretical training and a
smattering of practical experience on full
pay, and then, after passing through the
schools successfully, were sent fully-
fledged into jobs for which they had been
so briefly groomed.
From the point of view of men who
had learned their business the hard way
—from the bottom up—that was bad
enough, but permanent appointments
were granted to the cadets from the day
they had commenced training. That
meant that older hands with, say, six or
seven or even more years of temporary
service up to 1939 and who were
appointed in that year, became (and
remain) one year junior in the seniority
scale to the entire original batch of
trainees appointed.
Consequently, competent older men
watch youngsters with many years less
actual service to their credit proceed
with heartbreaking regularity into the
higher positions by virtue of their
fictitious seniority.
All that, of course, represents a purely
domestic problem. As for the declining
prosperity of the post-office generally.
Parliament, as The Bulletin suggests,
should elect a non-party committee to
probe deeply into the circumstances
which have converted an erstwhile
enormous surplus-producing service into
(on paper) one of repeated deficits. For
example, moneys earned by the P.M.G.
since early in the Chifley regime, obvi-
ously have sustained, and continue to
sustain, overstaffed, mushroom, non-
revenue-producing departments and/or
boards which might be heavily pruned or
even rooted out.
To conscientious minds within the
department post-office and telephone in-
creases are not the right answer.
Studied reorganisation of staffs, especially
in central administrative offices in all
States where overtime is mounting
monthly; concentration on connections
of waiting telephone services in districts
where spare cable exists, or could be
cheaply provided, to the temporary
exclusion of areas where provision
of such facilities demand long-term
expenditure; lopping of several highly-
paid minor executives in technical
sections where duties at present overlap ;
putting profits earned by the service
strictly back into the service—those are
just some of the measures which would
go a long way towards balancing the
P.M.G.’s budget.— Postscript (N.S.W.).
Victorian Institute of Technology
When Victorian Premier McDonald
was lately asked to consider implement-
ing plans, already past the blueprint
stage, for an Institute of Technology, he
said “Victoria cannot afford it.”
If that is the present State Government’s
educational policy, grave injustice is being
done to the coming generation of techni-
cians, scientists and engineers. No country
can afford to be backward in developing
science and technology to the limit of its
resources. With the increase of popula-
tion since the war, the rapid expansion
of industry and the large-scale develop-
mental works planned by Governments,
a more effective scheme for scientific and
technological progress is essential.
When the Hollway Government was in
office, the then Minister for Education
took vigorous action to begin planning
for an Institute of Technology. Unani-
mous agreement on the need for
an institute was reached by the
educational bodies concerned—the Uni-
versity, the Melbourne Technical College
and the Education Department. It was
felt that the institute would be the apex
of technical education to provide industry
and Government departments with
graduates proficient in practical engineer-
ing as well as theory.
To the present State Government, how-
ever, it seems far more important to
fiddle with such issues as off-the-course
betting, the liquor problem, threatening
the Egg Board, or uttering pretentious
statements about “housey-housey.”—

Wine and Visitors
“Bibber” (B. 30/5/’5l) is certainly right
when he says that Don Salvador de
Madariaga is by no means the first dis-
tinguished visitor to praise Australian
wines. In the past year alone high praise
has been given by A. P. Herbert, James
(“Travel-Talk”) Fitzpatrick, and, probr
ably more distinguished still, from a wine
point of view, by Victor H. Lanson, head
of the 190-year-old French champagne
house, who said in Brisbane on May 25
that he was delighted with Australian
wines and considered there were many
European wines that were not as good.
But neither “Bibber” nor Don Salvador
are quite correct when they say we neglect
local vintages. The Australian con-
sumption has risen from 4,500,000 gallons
in 1939 to 13,000,000 gallons in 1950.
In view of “Bibber’s” comments about
the necessity for an educational campaign
it should be of interest to know that the
Australian Wine Board recently published
a new wine-service manual which explains,
in simple terms, how to use and serve
“’ Struth! I WOULD have a helluva growth when I've on'y one

wines. It is produced for both wine
waiters and the general public, and copies
are obtainable from the Wine Producers’
Associations in the various States. —F. C.

is a matter of serious difference of
opinion.” He concedes that probably
both British breeds and zebus are neces-
sary for the job, “but they have not been
compared in properly-controlled trials,
and until this is done it is impossible to
be definite.”
Seven years ago, after a review of the
situation, the then Queensland Minister
for Agriculture and Stock decided: “So
here’s to the good old British breeds that
have stood the test and proved the best.
Why run the risk of prejudicing the
export trade by further tinkering with the
Ind’ : :n humpbacked zebu hybrids?”
In the important matter of increasing
beef production in the tropics it is as well
to set out squarely the points of com-
pa-ison. When that is done comparisons
with beef-raising in Argentine, Uruguay,
Texas and South Africa become irrele-
vant, for they are all beyond the tropical
conditions which make special problems
for cattlemen in Northern Australia.
The only country in the world that is
producing beef in the tropics under con-
ditions comparable with those in
Northern Australia is Brazil, which is
predominantly tropical. A delegation
sent by the Government of S.A. in 1936
to inspect the production and preparation
for market of crops and livestock in
South America, South Africa and New
Zealand looked over Brazil’s meat
industry.
It reported that cattle handled at meat-
works in the south “are almost wholly
of British breeds, with just a sprinkling
of crossbreds containing a little zebu
blood.” On the other hand, in “the
meatworks of Sao Paulo and Santos—
both on or near the tropic line —as well
as in the numerous slaughtering estab-
lishments scattered about the country in
[tropical] Sao Paulo, zebu blood pre-
dominates, and the only animal of other
breeds seen in any numbers are Caracu
and Criolla.” The last two are descen-
dants of early Portuguese and Spanish
cattle, also known as native cattle.
That is equivalent to saying that north
of a line joining Rockhampton in the
east and Point Cloates in the west there
would be no British breeds, and also that
south of it there would be little zebu
blood.
The delegation found that neither the
Gir nor the Guzerat zebu is as successful
when used for grading-up native cattle
as is the progeny of a cross between the
two strains, because “this cross gives
greater development to the individuals
produced, and also appears to increase
their vigor and prepotency.” It found,
too, that the zebu is “very popular in the
warmer districts of [tropical] Brazil, and
many cattlemen forsee the day when
other [native] breeds will be replaced
entirely by zebus or zebu crossbreds.”
This Brazilian practice of British cattle
south of, and a zebu strain north of the
tropics is consistent with the pronounce-
ment of our Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research on page 164 of its
journal for 1941: “It is emphasised that
no recommendation is made that zebus
should replace British breeds in areas
with a mean annual temperature of less
than 68deg. F., and an average minimum
for the coldest month of 66deg. F. How-
ever, the available evidence does suggest
that in less-favored areas the hybrids,
being hardier, might be used to
advantage.”
I suggest that the discussion be kept
within these geographical limits, and that
it be kept in mind that Santos, the ship-
ping port for zebu cattle country, is less
than half Sydney’s distance from London.
—Guzerat (Q.).
Butter Price
An increase in butter prices won’t
cause an increase in production. The
first result will be an immediate in-
crease in the price of land and cattle and
any newcomer to the industry will find
his return on capital no greater than it
would have been before the price rise.
Farmers already in the game may re-
ceive some benefit from increased returns,
but they will not produce more butter —
possibly production may even decline as
the farmer finds he can make a living
with less work. That has been the re-
action in many industries over the last
few years.
The greatest difficulty which dairying
has to face is long hours. Cows must be
milked twice a day, seven days a week.
If some one can devise a 40-hour week
(or even a 48-hour week) to fit into that
condition, butter supplies will increase.
The answer might lie in large holdings,
staffed by shift workers on a profit-
sharing basis, but I doubt whether dairy-
farmers would ever agree to such a pro-
ject.—Mullum (N.S.W.).
Teachers
Surely it is time everyone, including
teachers themselves, gave away the myth
that teaching is a vocation (B. 6/6//51),
and that such a sordid thing as money
should never be offered as payment for
services rendered.
The vocation idea probably dates back to
the days of the monks, who were the only
teachers. They were also the only doctors,
pharmacists and writers. The monks had
few needs, and these could be easily met.
The food-suppliers of the monasteries
were such that beggars and the needy
could be fed. If a special splash had to
be made I suppose a little extra could be
had from the tithe that all had to pay.
Today teachers are not in the monas-
teries but in the hard mercenary world.
When I bought my furniture the manager
did not knock off a few pounds because
my soul was in my work. No doctor has
ever said to me, “as a fellow professional
man, this injection will cost you half-
price.” A dentist said to me, while wait-
ing for the dope to act, “Except for the
holidays I could never see much in teach-
ing.” As it was a £5OOO-a-year man
speaking to a £5OO one I don’t suppose
he could.
Teachers, if they are as important as
even their critics admit, are entitled to a
decent standard of living. To obtain that,
in these days of organisations and pres-
sure groups, they must organise, stake
their claims and fight for their rights.—
H. G. (N.S.W.).
Decentralisation
Apart from the simulation of decen-
tralisation practised by State Govern-
ments since the last war in assisting small
factories to transfer to country centres,
are there any examples of real decen-
tralisation?
Take Government or semi-Government
instrumentalities in Victoria. The Edu-
cation Department has its district inspec-
tors, but these men act only in an
advisory or supervisory capacity, and
important decisions are taken by their
chiefs in Melbourne. If a system of
regional inspectors were instituted with
the officers clothed with some power in
the localities they know and serve so
well it would mean less delay and more
equitable decisions by men on the spot.
It is the same with the C.R.8., and
much the same comments apply. Divi-
sional engineers are scattered throughout
the State, but they have no executive
authority, and municipalities find that
proposals are held up while they proceed
through the engineer to head-office.
In transport a regional system operates,
but appears to have the effect only of
adding to the red-tape—not facilitat-
ing a smoother working of existing
regulations.
The Police Department in recent re-
organisation has broadened its adminis-
tration by allowing for a greater number
of districts, but superintendents have only
limited authority and can only make
relatively unimportant decisions.
Banking institutions complete the
picture. Go to any trading bank for a
loan and they will tell you they have to
refer the application to Melbourne.
Surely a local manager’s prestige and
knowledge of local individuals and con-
ditions should be sufficient to authorise
the advance?
Until there is a genuine Government
lead, decentralisation can only be a catch-
word, of no value in building-up a pros-
perous rural community. Plain
Australian (Vic.).
Wheatfarmers
Since June, 1945, the wheatfarmers
have subsidised the consumers to the
extent of over £150,000,000, so what are
the obligations which “Harry the Horse”
(B. 20/6/’5l) says they should recognise
to the community? True, the general tax-
payer aided wheatgrowers in the “hungry
’thirties,” but in turn did they not aid
the taxpayers by selling them wheat for
less than cost of production?
By selling wheat for local consumption
at prices far less than the export value
farmers have long since repaid any
obligations. Besides wheat for flour
they have supplied grain for breakfast-
foods, for egg, pork and bacon produc-
tion, for bran and meal used in butter,
milk and cheese production, and as
fodder for sheep, cattle, horses and even
dog-biscuits. Had all the wheat used
locally from the last two crops been
exported farmers would have been
£50,000,000 better off.
Before “H. the H.” can expect farmers
to grow more wheat he must provide
them with machinery replacements, more
farm workers, more building materials
for their accommodation, more super,
and silos. Before he can get these require-
ments he must first oblige the coalminers
and industrial workers to speed-up out-
put. He can’t expect workers to re nj
toiling on farms while'easy jobs and short
hours are available in the city. If the city
worker puts his shoulder to the wheel the
farmer might put his hand to the plough.

Carpentarian Thriller .
Richard H. Graves has written a fine
Australian boys’ novel in Spear and
Stockwhip (Dymocks), a story of the ad-
ventures which befell a party of drovers,
men and boys, who took 2000 Herefords
from Cartreff Downs across the Gulf
country to an estate near Arnhem Land.
A sinister team of cattle-thieves are
after their cattle, and also trying to re-
gain two sealed tins which one of the
boys found in a saddle he had exchanged
by mistake. The thieves organise
aboriginal raids oh the drovers, and kill
a mounted trooper; but the party win
through and make a triumphal appear-
ance in Darwin, where the thieves get
what is coming to them. Then, by way
of anti-climax, there is a final round-up,
on a deserted ex-Army air-strip, of the
master-mind, who is also a smuggler of
gold and drugs.
Without harping patriotically on his
Australian scenery, Mr. Graves has
shown himself a master of it; and Ms
sure handling of adventure, so that the
improbable becomes credible, makes one
think of such names as Marryat and
Ballantyne.
Bradman and Hjfpfory*
Philip Lindsay, who writes the
historical novels, seems on first thoughts
an unlikely author for Don Bradman in
the Phoenix House “Cricketing Lives”
series; but then, Bradman belongs to
history, and Philip Lindsay, as he showed
in his autobiography, has always
belonged to Australia in his heart.
His cricketing book shows, here and
there, too much of the historical
novelist: when Mr. Lindsay, searching
for a dramatic theme, insists on linking
his own literary career too closely to
Bradman’s scores ; and when, disregard-
ing a plain statement of the facts from
Bradman himself, he works up an
emotional crisis over a trivia) incident
on the occasion of Bradman’s last:
appearance at Lords. But on the other
hand the novelist’s romantic imagination
is responsible for this exceptionally fine
description of the significance of cricket :
Far be it from me to prattle metaphysics
or to bring to cricket esoteric symbolism,
but this it has above other sports—-it calls
not only for devotion and passion such as
the artist must bring to his art, but it
repeats in miniature the epic of mankind:
it repeats the tale of the hero, of the
lonely knight in an enchanted hostile world
which he defies with bat for a sword. There
is no real team spirit in it, none of the
loss of identity which one has in football,
when a pack must move as one man and
the selfish player by hogging the ball can
betray his side. It is a duel of bowler
against batsman defending his castle; a
duel in which one man battles against eleven
others with hands cupped ail round him to
catch his heart, while the wizard at the
other end weaves his spells in which each
ball comes with new enmity.
And, for the most part, the book is
written by the Australian rather than the
novelist; plain, realistic, sunlit writing,
full of nostalgia for great games and
great cricketers seen before Philip
Lindsay left for London: —
Woodfull remained. Calm, slow but
certain Woodfull who could stand all day in
hottest summer if needed to hold up his
wicket and refuse to flick at the most
appetising halls... .Burly Ponsford, stockily
built, one who at times had wrought us to
ecstasy, capable of centuries or of petrifac-
tion, of the quick bat or the stolid bat, a
man of infinite resource if of little fancy.
... .Then Kippax, frightening Kippax, the
graceful, the joyous, and yet the unreliable
Kippax for style, for cut and parry,
Kippax could equal any man at times and
I treasure the jewels of many an innings
to light me through the winter of memories.
Into that setting, of course, Bradman
bursts like a bombshell; or, rather, to
rectify the metaphor and avoid a cliche,
like a prolonged and incredible bombard-
ment ; the course of which Philip
Lindsay faithfully records and which he
resolutely—and rightly—refuses to regard
as “mechanical” : you can’t dispose of
the greatest batsman of all time by call-
ing him a “machine.”
Take it all round, it is an admirable
little book ; with nothing new to say
about Bradman, except in comment, but
mercifully free from statistics, and with
a pleasant survey of Bradman’s career
for the general reader.
Reviewed Briefly.
Within the Bubble: Joseph Shearing
(Heinemann). This story of a girl whose
mother was poisoned in Italy at the time
when cholera and Garibaldi were on the
rampage is a cut above the average
romance of dark doings. The girl’s battle-
of-wits against the sister of her aristo-
cratic Italian fiance ; her flight, when the
poisoning, which obviously benefited her,
was discovered ; her way of dealing with
a threatening emissary of the sister, are
done with verve, but beautifully con-
trolled, and with an economy all too rare
in such books.

Unseen Adventures: Geraldine Cum-
mins (Rider). Autobiography covering
34 years of psychic research, in the com-
pany of Sir Oliver Lodge, W. B. Yeats
and Dr. E. Somerville, Miss Cummins
says that once, at a seance with Yeats,
she got into telepathic communication
with the poet’s mind and related to him
the plot of a new play he was writing ;
also she investigated some spiritual com-
munications from Oscar Wilde, which she
believed genuine. The style, like that of
Dr. Rhine’s books on telepathy, is com-
pact and mathematical; possibly more
convincing for that reason but strangely
dull,
. * * * *
Relativity; a Richer Truth: Philipp
Frank, foreword by Einstein (Cape). Pro-
fessor Frank, who was Einstein’s successor
to the Chair of Physics at the University
of Prague and who subsequently for nine
years represented science at a series of
conferences in New York which tried to
“integrate science, philosophy and
religion,” defends the impartiality of
science and the “relative” way of thinking
on the grounds that “The general prin-
ciple of science tells us how God runs
the world and, therefore, every advance
in science is an advance in our knowledge
of God’s regime,” Einstein’s own exposi-
tions of his “cosmic religion” are much
more lucid and graceful; but the small,
book is, with difficulty, readable and, of
course, highly topical.

and techniques that go to make all kinds

N.S-W. Grazier Says ...
3,000 BURR INFESTED SHEEP SHORN
WITHOUT ONE COMB OR CUTTER BREAKAGE
Mr. C. J. Lawler, of “Tara Hall,” near Scone, N.S.W., was amazed recently when the new 7 Moffat-Virtue Shearing
Gear he installed went through his 3000 burr-infested sheep without a hold-up, and without breaking a comb or cutter.
Mr. Lawler said, “I had two paddocks with a lot of Bathurst Burr in them, and the Moffat-Virtue Gear w r ent through
the sheep as though the Burr was not there at all.”
This is a different story to the tales
Mr. Lawler tells of his earlier experi-
ences. In many a shed shearers were
cut about the arms when handpieces
jammed, shattering combs and cutters.
On one occasion a kerosene-bucket, full
of broken combs and cutters, was taken
from the shed at the end of shearing.
To-day, as Mr. Lawler found out, with
the Moffat-Virtue Safety Drive you don’t
get tiiese troubles at all.
When a handpiece locks completely in
wire, or other hard foreign matter, a
Shock - absorber Spring automatically
disengages the handpiece from the down-
tube.
In burrs or other slight obstructions
the action of the Shock-absorber Spring
causes a fractional hesitation in the
drive, without disengaging the hand-
piece. This hesitation clears the trouble
and the shearer carries on with his
shearing without interruption.
The Moffat-Virtue Safety Drive is sup-
plied as standard equipment without
extra charge, in all Moffat-Virtue Shed-
type Gear. It eliminates time lost by the
shearer pausing to replace broken combs
and cutters ... and gives the shearer pro-
tection from injury. It greatly reduces
comb, cutter and handpiece breakages
. . . and requires no adjusting for dif-
ferent types of sheep.
This Drive was the first really prac-
ticable solution to the problem of shear-
ing burry sheep.
ms
Like many other improvements in
Moffat-Virtue Gear, it was the result of
the experience gained by the Company
through its contract shearing business.
This experience helped Moffat-Virtue to
their present leadership in Shearing
Gear.
TWO OTHER "FIRSTS" PUT
M.V. GEAR IN FRONT
Ball-bearing overhead gear, although
now used universally, was first produced,
by Moffat-Virtue. Their original design
eliminated the carbonised oil problem,
and substantially lowered power require-
ments and cost of shearing.
Another “first”; this one still exclu-
sive to Moffat-Virtue Gear; is Full-float-
ing Transmission.
This transmission eliminates any drag
on the cone-pulley from the downtube.
No matter how hard the shearer pulls on
the tube the speed of the cutter never
varies.
