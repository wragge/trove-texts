make these Diseases a speciality, particularly as, under

persons exist, chiefly, because Duly Qualified Prac-

Dr. PERRY invites the fullest investigation into his
credentials, and gives his Personal Consideration to
bach Case, and in all cases tells the Patient the exact
nature of his complaint, the cost of a cure, and the time
it will take.
Dr. PERRY’S experience in the treatment of these
Diseases has been so varied and extensive, that he is able
to tell absolutely whether the case is curable or not, and
therefore is willing to

THE WAY TO WEALTH.
The way to wealth is as plain as the way to market.
The majority of the wealthy men of Sydney, Melbourne
and Brisbane made their money by buying land in these
capital cities while it was low in price, and before these
cities were so large and populous as at present.
Western Australia
is the coming colony. Her Capital City will become
a second Melbourne or Sydney.
If you want to make money, buy land
there now. It is a good spec.

SPECIAL MEDICAL NOTICE.
Dr. G. H. RAYMOND,
Tub Eminent
Botanic Physician, Specialist L Medical Writer,
Has commenced Practice in Sydney, after a residence of
four years in Queensland, twelve months in Western Aus-
tralia, nearly three years in South Australia, and eighteen
months in the City of Melbourne.
The latter place Mr. Raymond was compelled to abandon
in consequence of the climate proving detrimental to his
health.
During DR. RAYMOND’S practical experience of nine
years in Australia, he has huilt up a reputation un-
approached by any other physician in chronic diseases in
the colonies. Da. Raymond has also relieved and cured
patients who had tried to no avail the so-called leading
medical talent in the world. Proof of this will be seen in
his valuable and scientific publications; and Dr. Raymond
would call the attention of deaf people to his latest scien-
tific paper on the “ Merits and Demerits of Artificial Ear-
Drums and Electro-Magnetic Treatment.”
DR. RAYMOND w ould also inform deaf persons that he
is the only AURIST in the British Empire that ever
exposed the fallacy of sticking ear-drums in the ear for
cure of deafness ; and, moreover, it is rank quackery for
any “Aurist” or “Oculist” to induce people to believe
that a mere external remedy will cure a disease, the root
of w'hich lies in the general constitution.
DR. RAYMOND is a Thorough Physician, as well as a
Specialist; hence his unrivalled success.
A series of Aural and Ophthalmic Papers, supplementary
to a volume published in 1887, will be sent on receipt of a
penny stamp. Address
No. 62 Carrington Street, Wynyard Square,
SYDNEY, N.S.W.
Works acknowledged by 11.R.H the Princess of Wales.
NOTE.—No mineral Poisons or the Knife used, nor
agonising blisters. Veritas odium par it!
Dr. Raymond intends shortly to Lecture on the eminent
American Medical Philosopher—Dr. Samuel Thomson,
founder of the Botanic System of Practice, and the first
man to expose the Errors and Fallacies of the Faculty.
Dr. Raymond will, when he mounts the public platform,
be the youngest medical lecturer and advocate in the
English-speaking world, he not having yet attained his
thirtieth year.

SWOBX CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kloelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
t rmd into Bronchitis and became chronic. 1 consulted
in we l him one doctor, and during that time took a a rent
ijXianlitii of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but 1 became worse every day, wasting away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, 1 became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. 1 agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At (he
end of three months I was taken had one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time 1 commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. Abou t a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, 1 am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.

Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe, lie has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. 11 Is practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO

for Remedies necessary for the cure of NEK-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1890.
Organisations of the Discontented.
I.— Communism.
Now that the inequity of social conditions
has caused a ferment in all civilised com-
munities, a brief enquiry into some of the
methods afoot for the amelioration of the
misery responsible for this discontent, can-
not be deemed superfluous, especially when
it is remembered that these organisations are
wholly misunderstood by the careless and
persistently misrepresented by the mone-
tarily-interested. In fact, to most people
the terms, Socialist, Communist, and
Anarchist, are synonyms for conspirator,
plunderer and assassin, and all who aim at a
re-construction of the social fabric are lumped
together as dynamiters and low-browed
desperadoes, associated for purposes of self-
aggrandisement, pledged to substitute for
existing institutions, a social order founded
on a complete disregard for all that is
universally regarded as honourable and
humane.
# # #
Communists or Humanists, those who
believe with Feuerbach that: The isolated
man is incomplete both as a moral and a
thinking being ; that: Isolation is finitude
and limitation, community is freedom and
infinitude, and from these statements draw
the conclusion that the Ego should be
merged in the Tu, the individual in the
community, that self-love should be replaced
by brotherly love, and that private property
should become collective—were first inter-
nationally united under that appellation at a
period memorable for European revolutions
—1847-8. At that time also was first pub-
lished their famous manifesto—the first de-
claration in favour of international amity
among wage-workers—the composition of
Karl Makx, the author of Das Kapital, and
Frederick Engels, his biographer, a work
which still broadly expresses their arguments
and aspirations.
# * *
The philosophical Communist asserts that
their movement is merely an evolutionary
continuation of a struggle that has been
waged since Time was, between freeman and
slave, patrician and plebeian, noble and
serf, guild-members and journeymen ; a con-
flict so bitter that it has rarely been sus-
pended except during revolutionary changes
or by the common ruin of the contentionists.
The latter-day victory of the middle-classes
over the patricians has by no means ended
the fight, merely narrowed the issue to a
tussle between the bourgeoisie and the
proletariat, a class hitherto only viewed as
pawns to bo used indiscriminately by either
side, and the Communist prophesies that
just as the upheaval of the bourgeoisie has
feudal and patriarchal rela-
tions, the privileges of rank and much
of the spoliation legalised under cover of
political and religious superstition*, so the
proletaire is inevitably destined to wring
from monopoly a tardy recognition of their
claims, ere eternally obliterating all class
distinctions. It is further argued that the
existence of widespread misery clearly
evinces an inequality of distribution and an
insufficiency of production, and as finality is
impossible in any department of human
activity in a world of ceaseless progression,
the Communist asserts that in thus prose-
cuting the search for human happiness, he is
merely fulfilling the primary object of life,
in that the chief end of man is the further-
ance of happiness for ail, at all times.
*
# #
Entirely disclaiming unity with rogues
and idlers, “the passive rot of the lowest
strata of society,” the Communist points out
that the domination of the bourgeoisie hav-
ing agglomerated population, centralised the
means of production, and assisted to concen-
trate property in the hands of the few, while
rendering labour-saving machines mere
instruments of bondage, surely proves that
this middle-class ascendancy has served its
purpose and is now a mere clog on the
development of the community. Though
previous social disagreements were caused,
as now, by class antagonisms, yet the sur-
roundings of the injured then made it
possible for them to maintain existence under
normal conditions, while to-day the condi-
tion of the worker relatively retrogrades so
rapidly that pauperism is developed more
speedily than either wealth or population.
This, to them, is plain proof that monopoly
cannot much longer hold its position, because
no longer capable of forcing its conditions
on society at large, and that the inability of
the modern monopolist to insure the existence
of his serfs even in a state of serfdom, his
inability and disinclination, at certain periods,
to support, instead of being sustained by the
proletariat, render his class-existence no longer
necessary or desirable. The bourgeoisie are
now maintained by the accumulation of the
savings of labour in private hands ; these
savings are the outcome of competitive
labour among the toilers excluded from
natural resources, but when production and
distribution is undertaken by universal
effort, the competition of individuals will be
hopeless, and the monopolists will be swal-

Communists have no desire to form a
distinct party in opposition to other working-
men parties, their aims are ; The organisa-
tion of the Proletariat, the destruction of
middle-class supremacy and the conquest of
political power for the worker. From the
dawn of intelligence till now, say they, all
property-relations have been subjected to
constant change, so that the power and
privileges once monopolised by kings,
nobles, the Church, and afterwards by the
squirearchy, are now usurped by the
plutocracy. Thus, as the evolution of time
narrows the issues, the social problem yearly
becomes less difficult of solution. Com-
munists disavow any desire to confiscate
that form of property which is the product
of the worker’s unaided labour ; do not
propose to alter the ownership of that which
is wholly self-acquired ; they simply desire
the equitable dispersion of all that is now
centralised through the spoliation of the
Many by the Few. Values, they argue,
created under the prevailing wage-system
are usually exploited for the formation of
private capital, a species of property propa-
gated by the ceaseless withdrawal of fresh
blood from the very veins of the worker
by a phlebotomising capitalist who injuriously
exercises an important social function, for
allhough the utilisation of the capital
he controls is not dependent on his
possession or personal exertions and
can only be set in motion by communal
action, although the necessity which compels
others to use it reproductively affords him an
opportunity to divert the bulk of its returns,
yet lie has the power to withdraw it from
circulation at any moment. Under Com-
munistic conditions, the capital thus mono-
polised would be devoted to the promotion
of universal well-being and the increase of
the common store.

But, interjects someone, Communism will
destroy independence, individuality and
liberty. Hardly, replies the Communist,
merely bourgeoise independence, individu-
ality and license, the liberty of the slave-
holder to own the slave; in fact, all that
monopoly is most desirous of conserving.
You monopolists, say they, are wroth because
of our openly-expressed desire to destroy
private property ; but, to-day, the acqui-
sition of property, even in the smallest
quantities, is impossible to nine-tenths of
the community, and the fact that the bulk
of mankind are thus debarred from ob-
taining a portion of the world’s wealth
furnishes you with your opportunity.
What Communism would fain accomp-
lish is not the mere destruction of private
property-holding, but the annihilation of the
monopoly of opportunities. When labour
can no longer be transformed into rent,
interest, or profit, says the bourgeoisie, then
ambition and individuality will bo extin-
guished. It is plain, interjects the Com-
munist, by your iteration of the term
individuality that nothing more is at stake
than the individuality of the property-
holder ; accepting for the nonce your limited
application of the term, we undoubtedly
desire to abolish such an individuality, for it
is the monster that has swallowed up the
individuality, liberty, and happiness of the
bulk of the human family.
The monopolist also argues that with the
abolition of bourgeoisie property all incen-
tives to labour would cease, and universal
idleness prevail. On the other side it is
asserted that were this possible social chaos
would long ere this have arrived, for, under
the prevailing system of competitive pro-
duction for profit and monopolistic distri-
bution, those who toil not are ever adding to
their store, while those who toil for all
obtain no possessions worthy the name, and
therefore, from the monopolists’ standpoint,
are without incentives to labour. Of course,
says the Communist, it is perfectly natural
that the property-holder should imagine that
the present systems of production and dis-
tribution are eternal verities instead of mere
passing relations in social and economic
evolution, nor is it difficult to understand
why the joyless machines whose exertions
maintain him in his position, should, in so
many cases, be unaware that they have any
good reason to consider the matter at all, or
that their consideration could, in any way,
tend to its alteration.
# # *
The Communist, furthermore, claims that
the attainment of supremacy by the proletary
will bring about universality of industrial
production, and erase national and racial
antagonisms, for when the spoliation of one
individual by another ceases, then the
spoliation of weak nations by the strong is
doomed. Thus the barbarous and unreason-
ing hostility that demands expression in the
establishment of standing armies and navies
will be eradicated and the interchange of
products and ideas facilitated. This supre-
macy will also be signalised by the with-
drawal of capital from the present con-
tracted channels, the centralisation of all
productive forces in the hands of the users
and an intelligent endeavour to use all natural
resources to the best advantage.
# * *
At the outset this programme involves an
apparently despotic interference with what
many term the “rights of property,” though
how the inanimate can have any “rights ” is
not very clear, but if, for the sake of argu-
ment, it should be granted that property has
rights, as its office is the maintenance of life,
then it is surely evident that such rights
must be held in abeyance whenever they
begin to clash with those of animate human
beings. The interference, however, is
unavoidable as a primary means towards a
necessary change, and the Communist de-
clares that it will be justified by results.
For when class distinctions have disappeared,
class antagonisms will be forgotten ; when
political power is chieffy centred in the hands
of the industrious, then the power of the few
to oppress the many will be nullified and the
class-supremacy of the proletary having per-
formed its office, will die out like the other
dominations that have preceded it and be
merged in a universality of effort and inter-
est. In these latter days everyone’s needs
will be satisfied from the common stock ; no
one will possess aught that he cannot per-
sonally put to good use, and no arena will
exist for the monopoly of opportunities that
compels the sturdy and intelligent non-pro-
perty-owner to beg leave tj toil from the
effortless monopolist. Then will land, pro-
ductive instruments, and means of transit
become commonwealth, and justly, since
from their nature they can only be
thoroughly employed by general combina-
tion. Then will the extremes of wealth and
penury, titular and class distinctions,
racial animosities, sexual disabilities, religious
feuds, idleness, ignorance and crime be
minimised or annihilated. Then will there
be no limit to the free development of every
virtuous faculty ; all will be busy, well-
informed, well-treated, free and therefore
moral, because “the free development of
each is the free development of all.” Never-
theless, the millennium is, happily, unattain-
able. Happily unattainable, simply be-
cause the ideal can never be realised;
because anticipation is more enjoyable
than realisation ; because each barrier to
human progress when overthrown, becomes
a watch-tower from whence fresh obstacles
may bo surveyed ; because the loftier the
eminence the wider the horizon, and with a
more varefied mental atmosphere hitherto
unsuspected evils will be revealed, fresh
avenues for thought and effort disclosed,
and still higher eminences unveiled.
a * *
To recapitulate: Communism may be
briefly described as the organisation of
society into industrial groups, whereof each
member labours according to ability for the
common weal, while the personal return is
more nearly apportioned to wants than with
regard to results. Here let their motto
speak : From each according to capacity, to
each according to necessity. Of course the
individualist asserts that this supplying of
wants from commonwealth, unless the return
be made proportionate to the recipient’s
actual contributions, Avould remove the chief
incentive to labour and discourage the in-
dustrious. The disciples of Blanc and
Cabet reply that this argument exactly
describes the present situation, that now
those who work hardest earn least and
that the privileged idlers everywhere receive
the bulk of the earnings of toil. Also that
in no community is production invariably
approximate to effort. This is particularly
true of the blundering worker, whose exer-
tions may be equal to or even greater than
those of the expert, whose skill enables him
to perform with ease what the other executes
with difficulty. Therefore, the former’s
waste uf tissue is probably as large, it not
larger than cnat of the latter ; consequently
his necessities are, at least, equally great
and so it is unjust that he should receive a
lesser portion of the sustenance required for
the repair of that waste, especially when it is
remembered that at present even skilled
workers receive little more than what is
absolutely requisite to the support of fif e>
Furthermore, that all men do not labour
solely for pay, that they are compelled, in
many cases to do their utmost by a high sense
of duty and the demand of the faculties for
active expression and developmen t. In support
of this statement, they point to the uure-
munerated efforts of bygone poets, philoso-
pliers, patriots, prophets, scientists, explorers
inventors and leaders of advancement
throughout the world, and declare that the
evolution of society will elevate mankind to
an altitude where Communism is the only
system compatible with the prevalent ideas
of justice, to a state wherein all are eager
to perform their share of the daily toil, and
the chief aim of each dweller will be the
furtherance of the general good by the devo-
tion of all his energies to the service of the
community. Then ; “ Law will have become
unnecessary, Communism will be the natural
expression of social life, and perfect liberty
will be the lot of all, because each shall have
become a law unto himself.”
* * *
On this distant goal the eyes of the Com-
munist are ever bent, while round his brows
are bound this appeal : “ The workers have
nothing to lose but their chains ; they have
a world to win. Proletarians of all nations
unite.” His effort to further the free expan-
sion of human aspirations cannot fail to be
beneficial in many ways, even if it do not
fully achieve its purpose, for in order to
arrive at any height of excellence it is neces-
sary that the ideal should be a loftier one
than can reasonably be deemed possible of
accomplishment.
The Gathering of the Colonels.
The population of Australia consists of some
three million human beings—and they promise
before long to be mostly colonels* In the
obtrusively “loyal” colony of Victoria, in
fact, they are mostly colonels already, and tie
man who is not a colonel is generally either a
captain or a lieutenant, and tiie person who is
neither a colonel, a captain nor a lieutenant has
grievously misused the opportunities bestowed
upon him by Providence, or else he is a cripple
and is thus debarred from displaying himself in
the gorgeous panoply of war. In the Victorian.
Parliament, “the Party of the Colonels” has
become a recognised political institution, which
increases in strength at each succeeding elec-
tion, and in course of time it will probably
develope into a “ War Party,” and become
actively aggressive, whereas, so far, it has only
been passively obnoxious. It is much given to
wearing uniform in season and out of season,
but principally out of season; it is badly
addicted to strategy and fortifications and
complex problems relating to guns; and it
professes to regard Australia as a great military
State, and to consider every political question
which' comes before it exclusively from the
standpoint of the “army.” The component
parts of tills rampant faction consist chiefly of
the tameless softgoodsman, and the unquench-
able person in the wholesale tea interest, and the
bootmaking hero, and other small, fat, brown-
EHannibals of moreor less importance; but
.se they are privileged to blunder about in
front of an awkward squad of militia they wear
their titles at all hours of the day and night,
and the melancholy page of Han sard is mostly
devoted to recording the observations of the
Major-General on strategical railways, and the
outpourings of the Colonel on torpedoes, to-
gether with the remarks of sundry lieutenants
and a large quantity of loose captains on things
at large. And, considering the number and
ferocity of this military oligarchy, it becomes a
serious question whether the country might not
do well to crowd through with a smaller supply
of colonels. An army of some kind is, unfortu-
nately, a necessary evil, but wdieu an army is
nearly all colonels, and almost every colonel is in
Parliament, and they all feel called upon to run
the affairs of the nation on a war-footing, and
to look down with contempt upon the common
herd which doesn’t make an exhibition of itself
with a banner and a gun, the country might
find it safer to abolish its alleged troops and
chance the consequences.
* # #
The political party which is made up of the
Victorian colonels and their supporters is dis-
tinguished chiefly for a certain military Toryism
which is even a shade more offensive than the
worst specimen of ordinary unarmed Toryism
known in this country, and should a similar
party form itself in the other Australian legis-
latures, it will almost inevitably be distin-
guished by the same objectionable characteris-
tics. The local colonel is a howling Conservative
by reason of his clothes. He is permitted to
shine at Government House in the glaring
colours of a bird of paradise, and as the sergeant
of police—who also wears a uniform—is ex-
cluded, and flic clerk in the Lands Department
who, like the colonel, is a public servant, but
a servant without a sword or a decoration —is
seldom admitted and is of no account when he
is admitted, therefore the colonel regards him-
self as the special prop of vice-royalty, and as a
being apart from the nation at large. In his
military capacity lie takes his orders fi in the
Government, but as the Government takes its
orders from Parliament, and the Victorian Par-
liament is largely composed of an accumulation
of colonels, he has a dual capacity, and his
oppressive dignity is rendered almost incurable
in consequence. Why the colonel should be
allowed to inflict himself on the Legislature of
a peaceful country, when the other public ser-
vant who dusts the street with a broom and a
shovel is entirely unrepresented, has never been
explained. Except in military matters he is
almost useless as a legislator, and Australia has
no military problems on hand. He iS haunted


w ith * craving for strategical railways to
be constructed regardless of cost to all man-
ner of desolate spots on the lovely sea-shore,
s 0 that when the hazy and indefinite thing
known as “ the enemy” presents itself the local
f or ces may be promptly conveyed by rail to a
nlace where they will be of no use to anybody,
and from which they will probably be unable
t 0 g e t back. He is always anxious to raise
more troops and to create more colonels, and
then the new regiments fade away mysteriously,
and only the colonels are left. He never loses a
chance to demand that some more expensive
fortifications shall be put up in a hollow place
jn the middle of a dense forest where there are
no roads and no inhabitants—in short he suffers
f ro m a mistaken impression that Australia is a
military state run by an oligarchy of colonels,
an d unless something is done to convince him of
his mistake trouble of some kind will probably
ensue.
« * *
The scheme of building up a “great Australian
army” to maintain the interests of Imperialism
and grovel, regarding which Sir Henry Parkes
has Avasted so much enthusiasm, and thereby
ruling these lands on a semi-military system
under the guidance of some idiotic Cromwell
or small, fat-headed Caosar, has already gone too
far. The softgoods colonel may be mean and
insignificant, but the autocrat with a cotton
umbrella is as objectionable as the auto-
crat Avith a sceptre, and a despotism of
armed importers and ironmongers and lawyers
would be probably a shade more oppressive and
certainly more ignominious than the despotism
of a Moltke. The man avlio dies, however
uselessly, at the cannon’s mouth may preserve a
certain dignity even in his fall, but the person
who is shot with a dead cat on a raft is not
tragic —he is only ridiculous. The fact that the
Australian colonel is short and fat and wheezy
and only a badly-disguised draper at the best,
and that he is miserably ignorant of the rudi-
ments of his alleged profession in addition to
his other sins, is merely a reason why he should
be the more promptly suppressed; these
features in his character may render him useless
for purposes of national defence, but they make
him none the less dangerous to the country
which he infests. The officer who has neither
brains nor intelligence, and who hangs on by
clutching his saddle with one hand and his
horse’s mane with the other, would only arouse
the derision of an invader, but he is as capable
as any other man of rushing a crowd of peaceful
citizens and demonstrating his zeal by shooting
at an unarmed population which is unable to
shoot in reply. The two prominent features of
the genuine or military colonel are that he is a
soldier in the first place and a grovelling Tory
in the second ; the softgoods colonel is a
decided failure as a soldier, but he fulfils the
second part of his duty to perfection —as a Tory
he has no equal anywhere on earth.
* * *
The case of this rising oligarch admits of only
two possible remedies. The first and the most
obvious is to abolish him in his capacity as a
politician and by keeping him for use instead
of merely for show to Avipe out the military
aristocracy which is gradually coming into
existence in this peaceful land. Nations which
li\'e by war may, with some show of reason,
convert the inflated colonel and major-general
into a sort of nobility, but as Australia has no
present desire to conquer any adjacent country
and has no intention which up to date has been
confided to The Bulletin of starting on a path
of gore and slaughter, the Australian officer is
only an ordinary public servant and should be
treated as such. In actual A'alue lie is much
below the country policeman with the pro-
minent feet, and in usefulness the individual
who shunts trucks on a railway is greatly his
superior. His dignity is based entirely on the
fact that a peaceful nation has chosen to make
itself as far as possible a slavish imitation of
the harassed and oppressed communities of the
Old World ; because the despotic soA'ereigns of
Europe are surrounded by military hirelings as
the only possible safeguard against assassination,
therefore Australia —in default of the approved
type of active butcher—has raised the tailor to
military dignity, and lent him a certain fictitious
importance by allowing him to fool round as
the armed guardian of vice-royalty. As
nobody wants to shoot an Australian Governor,
and as the soft-goods officer would probably be
too scared to interfere supposing any one made
the attempt, that warrior is of exactly the same
\'alue as a navy to an inland state, or a priest
to a nation which recognises no god. There-
fore the city colonel, who exists solely on the
strength of his clothes and his dignity, should
be restricted to his purely military duties, if
he has any ; he should be disqualified for a seat
iu the Legislature where his anxiety to prove
that lie is a soldier instead of a disguised trader
makes him clamour incessantly for more guns
and torpedoes and fortifications ; and he should
he restrained someAvhat in the use of his title
seeing that the nation has no use for a colonel
while ho is engaged in supervising the accounts
°f a building-society, and only wants him while
actually on duty. Also there should be a good
deal less of him. It is difficult to throw a brick
m any given direction without injuring a colonel,
and this superfluity is strangely out of place in
a country which has no warlike traditions, and
no desire to go out and kill anybody except
nuder the influence of actual necessity.
« # #
I’he other alternative is to abolish the whole
crowd of overAvhelming military dignitaries in
one act, but possibly this comprehensive mea-
sure might be premature and inadvisable. The
Australian colonel is a. costly nuisance; the
great object of his existence is to get up a
general conscription, and put everybody in
uniform, and run the entire country on a mill-
; ar y basis, with a howitzer and a state of siege
and an entrenched camp and other warlike
appurtenances, and no reasonable being expects
"bat he would answer any conspicuously useful
Purpose in case of war ; but it is just possible
nvt his presence might scare a weak-minded
and uneducated enemy for a day or two till
someone else had time to arrange a plan of
defence. Therefore, the country may resolve
0 tolerate him in a modified or alleviated form,
J 'least fora time. But if the warlike account-
an - and the blood< hirsty conqueror in the *©a-
trade, and the rampant mining - speculator,
whose feet are so big that every _ horse
he mounts considers itself in shafts,
persist in their attempt to manage the
world on military principles, their abolition
will become inevitable. The formation of a
military party in the Legislature is miserably
out of place in a land which has no enemies and
no desire to acquire any, and the formation of
a military spirit in the country is merely the
assiduous cultivation of a desire to kill some-
body—a process which is apt to end disastrously.
If Australia is ever invaded, it will probably
be because one of her cheap, second-hand
Napoleons has repeated the stupendous blunder
of the Soudan, and has recklessly hit an oppo-
nent who is large enough to retaliate. Ireland
came to grief through an insane attempt to run
eight or ten kings simultaneously some centuries
ago, and the ceaseless accumulation of colonels
in these colonies promises, sooner or later, to
be almost equally dangerous.
Selfishness.
Despite the overcrowded market of ethical
literature it seems nevertheless impossible to find
a writer who honestly deals with social ques-
tions arguing thereon with due regard to first
principles. As an instance of this, take the
case of Selfishness and Disinterestedness, the
former being assumed as a vice, and the latter
as a virtue. Can there be any greater false
premise in logic than this? One frequently
hears the phrase repeated that So-and-so is a
selfish person, and, consequently, objectionable ;
therefore, to those who imagine that they have
ever performed in their lives what they suppose
to be a disinterested action, a few remarks may
profitably be addressed. It is evident that
man is still under very erroneous impressions
regarding his ideas of human motives. Meta-
physics clearly and unquestionably prove that
selfishness is the mainspring of every slightest
action in life. No human being ever acted
without a motive, else he would not act at all,
and no motive under the sun can survive
microscopic investigation. Either directly or
indirectly every deed we perform is for our own
benefit in some way or another, and it is only
through a long existing aberration of intellect
that rational organisations believe and persuade
themselves that they are generous, disinterested
beings.
# * *
It is marvellous how readily a kind action
done reconciles a man to himself. Conscience
whispers “ What a good fellow you arc !” and
straight away the benefactor hurries to the bar
and shouts for himself, exulting in his self-
conscious goodness. There is also another
motive influencing men to benevolent action,
which, although the one most generally lauded,
is nevertheless the most interested of the lot,
namely, “ doing good for the sake of everlast-
ing happiness,” a recommendation of a certain
antediluvian fossil by name Paley. There is
another feature of subtle self-flattery in the
condescension of the well-to-do lounger en-
dowed with all the favours of fortune, associat-
ing in an assumed equality with some unfor-
tunate to whom fate has assigned the darker
paths of circumstance. In this case it is the
conscious sense of power which gratifies his
vanity in the exercise of the protective faculty,
and, as regards the oft-quoted beautiful disin-
terestedness which is a feature in the frank
readiness wherewith youth contracts friend-
ships, no greater rubbish has yet offended
thoughtful minds. It is with no spirit of cal-
culation that such contracts are formed, yon
will say ; but this is a mistake, as youth is
drawn into companionship half by some void
within itself and half by some quality which
appears to supply that void. Some do the
very finest things out of an exalted self-esteem,
carrying their point of honour so high that
there is no sacrifice they are not capable of
making provided it only serve to elevate their
opinion of themselves. However, the investi-
gators of motives can always prove to the un-
prejudiced inquirer that the philanthropist acts
for love of fame; the woman of self-sacrifices
and good works is consciously posing before an
admiring world, or that some other equally per-
sonal considerations impel action, moral or im-
moral, indiscriminately.
When the starving mother takes the last
morsel of bread from the locker and hands it
over to her infant at the cost of her life, she
does so because by that action she derives more
pleasure than she would were she to eat it her-
self. This cannot fairly be held to morally
detract from the beauty of her action, it merely
serves as an illustration of the difference between
philanthropy and anti-socialism. Virtue exists
in man not in the concentration of his
happiness in himself, but in the seeking thereof
in others : but in either case his deeds will be
selfish and interested, and it is therefore evi-
dently desirable that the correct definition of
selfishness be recorded in the human brain for
evermore. For the . present the best word
corresponding to the idea sought to be con-
veyed is egoism— i. e. , a vice, and for the con-
verse socialism— i.e. , a virtue. Selfishness and
disinterestedness have no logical affinity with
their pristine significations.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
West Sydney Election.
ì
than all, a victory at the ballot-box on Saturday
would have., been an example and a direction to
Labour bodies everywhere, and have endowed
the ensuing general elections with a new' and
specific character. Unfortunately, Labour
blundered away all these advantages last Satur-
day. Mr. A. G. Taylor possesses his seat by
the votes of Labour, but his success derogates
from the authority and influence of the
Labour council. Instead of being the pro-
duct of the council’s energies his candidature
w r as a contumelious rejection of the advice and
action of the entire Labour body. No matter
what Mr. Taylor’s abilities may be, no matter
how democratic his sentiments or radical his
conduct, no matter how suitable a mouthpiece
he might make for the masses in Parliament,
the fact that the Labour organisation had
selected another man for the Labour vote
should have made him, if a true friend of the
cause, stand aside on an occasion when a test
case was practically submitted to the inspection
of the public. And it did not matter if the
nominee of the Council w ere the reverse of all
Mr. Taylor claims to be. The particular man
was not the primary consideration ;it was the
demonstration by Labour of the fact that it
possessed the knowledge to select and the power
to return to Parliament a man of its own. That
demonstration stands now indefinitely post-
poned. More than that, a precedent has been
set which will heavily w eight future decisions
of the Council respecting Parliamentary elec-
tions. What Mr. Taylor did successfully
others similarly wdlful in temper and character
will try to do, and whether they win or lose
they will bo thorns in the flesh of organised
Labour. Now' that the evil is so unmistakably
disclosed it should be grappled with at once,
and, if needs be, knifed from the system. The
man who sets himself up to defeat Labour’s
nominee should receive no quarter from the
hands of Labour. A few more blunders like
that perpetrated by the Labour party at the
West Sydney election will prove the leaders
hopelessly incompetent to exercise any influence
in the Parliamentary world.
A Permanent Agreement.
Ever since the first beginning of the revolt of
humanity it has been the favourite complaint of
the Capitalist that there is no end to the
demands of Labour. The concession of yester-
day has been followed by the demand for fresh
concessions to-day, and the concession of to-day
lias only paved the way for new' encroachments
to-morrow, while beyond this point lie all the
uncounted days of time, to be spent by the
workman in making further inroads on the
privileges of the rich. Consequently, the organs
of Capital are loud in their demands for a “final
settlement.” Hitherto all the conventions
entered into have only been of temporary effect,
but now' the time has come to draw a definite
line, and declare that concession shall never go
any further, and the Federated Shipowners of
Great Britain have resolved, should all other
means fail, to organise the must stupendous
boycott know'll in history, by way of bringing
about “a reasonable and permanent agreement”
which will last till the earth and the labour
problem is worn out: —
The Times to-day publishes a statement that the mem-
bers of the Shipowners’ Federation, being determined to
submit no longer to the continual aggressiveness of the
unions, have decided to lay up ali vessels in every port in
the United Kingdom unless the unionists agree to con-
clude a reasonable and peimanent agreement.
The Times heartily applauds this decision of the Ship-
owners’ Federation as the only means of checking the
intolerable evils of the present system, which keeps the
shipping trade in a constant ferment owing to the never
ending disputes.
The one point which the associated capitalists
seem to have overlooked in this programme is
that nothing on this earth is permanent, and
consequently they are attempting to- do some-
thing which all the world has tried in vain since
the beginning of history. There never will be
any end to the demands of Labour, and to
attempt to bring them to an end is an attempt
to tie-up the ocean with a string. Neither will
there ever be an end to the demands of Capital
so long as Capital lasts—so the situation is
exactly equal. To bring about the “ permanent
agreement ” concerning which the employers
have wasted so much eloquence, it is necessary
in the first place that the employer should be
immortal, and in the second that the employe
should live for ever ; but on the very day when"
that convention is signed the men who signed it
will commence to die off and new men will fill
their places, and as the dead cannot control the
living, the “permanent agreement” begins to
fall to pieces before the ink is dry. And in en
this is only the first stage of the difficulty. If
the scheme of the Shipowners’ Federation is
ever to be carried out, that body must be in a
condition to guarantee that the price of food
will never go up, and that the value of money
will never go down, and that rent, clothing,
taxation, and a hundred similar things will
undergo no more fluctuations. They must
undertake that there shall be no further
changes in shipbuilding, that steam will never
be superseded by any other power, that no
new inventions in machinery will disturb the
present conditions of labour, that the
trade of Britain will never leave her, that
her ports w ill not silt up, and that the sea itself
will not lie one day abandoned as a highway,
and aerial navigation render ships useless and
superfluous. They have got to harness down
the earth, the air, and the ocean, and. to make
sure that no convulsion of nature will interfere
with the course of trade, and they must chain
up the elements of war, revolution, and civil
commotion, and lodge a. caveat against the
development or retrogression of humanity, and
serve an injunction upon Providence lest any
influence which is not covered by the precau-
tions already enumerated shoukl interpose, and
set the agreement at defiance. And even when
all these things are done Labour and Capital
will both go on making fresh demands so long
as they both survive. There is no finality in
anything. Probably the old Carthaginian ship-
owner, . who put to sea in a top-heavy galley
with a half-ton of stone in place of an anchor
and the figure of Baal or Melkarth at the
bow, w r as confronted by the same difficulty,
and if so the chances are that he also fixed up a
“permanent agreement,” and settled the labour
problem for ali timo. Yet if be could rise from
his grave to-day he would find that his agree-
ment and a good many others of an equally per-
manent kind that succeeded it had been so
utterly forgotten that no one knew they had
ever existed.
Cash and Dignity.
Mb. Alexander Brown’s notice of motion, in
the New South Wales Assembly, for an all-
round increase in Ministerial salaries is a
feather-brained proposal which neither Parlia-
ment nor the community are at present likely
to seriously entertain, and might accordingly be
silently passed over were not it that Mr. Brown
states reasons for his motion. One of those
reasons is that the salaries of the present day
are “ not compatible with the maintenance of
the dignity ” of those who fill Parliamentary
offices. If there were no other reason for reject-
ing the motion this one would amply justify
opposition. It weds honour and money and, if
accepted, would extend still further the baleful
influence of the , large bank-balance. Some
money is certainly a necessity, and every
worker should receive fair pay for the work he
does ; but if there be dignity anywhere about,
it is in the work, and not in the pay, that it
resides. The Minister who cannot preserve his
dignity at current rates has altogether too
slippery a possession. What Mr. Brown means
by “ dignity ” is, possibly, ability to entertain
persons in lavish style and go about in social
splendour, but if so, ‘ ‘ dignity ” is the wrong
term for the exhibition. And the people have
got nothing to do with the entertainment of
Ministers or the appointments of their houses.
A Minister is paid for doing work, and whether
he gyrates in knee-breeches in the drawing-
rooms of Fashion, or
Goes to his garret, where he nightly rocks
His wizened infant in its candle-box
when his work is done, is of no concern to the
public. Whatever way his taste inclines he can
go, but he is not to make his taste a cause for
larger remuneration for his work. There are
several members in the present New South
Wales Parliament who hold Mr. Brown’s
opinions on Ministerial salaries, though they do
not adopt his language. These say bluntly that
the work of a Minister is worth more than £ISOO
a year. Even Mr. Francis Abigail, to whom
£ISOO a year passed for a while, declares that it
never paid him for the ability and industry
be expended at his post. These advocates for
an increase in salaries can be met squarely Avhew
they put their claim properly forward. Aus-
tralia is not unwilling to pay her statesmen
adequately, and no question of an exhausted
exchequer or depressed financial conditions
should stave off the demand for fair remunera-
tion, if at present it is unfair. But it may be
pointed out that if Mr. Brown’s scale be
adopted the Parliamentary officers of the
people, as apart from the paid members, will
stand New South Wales, with only about a
million of inhabitants, £33,800 a year, or for
the five colonies of the island an outlay at the
rate of £169,000. The population of Australia
only equals that of a first-class city, and there
is no reason why the public should accept either
Mr. Brown’s or Mr. Abigail’s assessment of
the executive difficulty of managing their
affairs. Let us go in the direction pointed out
by President Jackson, -who, when he opened
Congress, rode to the gate alone on his old white
horse,' and then when he had done his work,
unhitched the horse and unostentatiously rode
away again.
♦—
The Course of Justice.
The hideously erratic course of Australian
justice, and the wildlyjuncertain vagaries of
Australian judges, have engaged public atten-
tion for many years, but so far no one has made
any serious effort to find a cure for this social
disease. The establishment „of a Court of
Criminal Appeal is one obvious remedy, but
such a court, if presided over by the same class
of irascible gentlemen who now dispense gallows
and penal servitude on so lavish a scale, would
be only a partial and ineffective antidote at the
best. The occupants of the Bench are mostly
men who are rendered irritable by age and
disease, and senile decay, and they relieve their
sufferings and their aggravated feelings by
hanging the public, or sending it to gaol in a
liberal and generous way which is fast bringing
the law into contempt. Some of them are
harassed by gout, and as the Oriental despot,
when suffering under this complaint, gives vent
to his agony by flaying his doctor and setting
lire to the nearest of his subjects, so the judge
finds expression for his inward grief in passing
life-sentences, interspersed with chains and
solitary confinement. Others are afflicted with
liver-complaint, and the recurring paroxysms
can be traced by the path of devastation which
the patient leaves behind him when he takes his
seat on the Bench, and proceeds to administer the
law with the vigour of a man who would gladly
flog.the whole earth, and have it hanged after-
wards. The judge with a pulmonary disease is
generally mild and humane in the balmy air of
an Australian summer, but in winter he is im-
pervious to reason, and scatters long terms of
imprisonment in a way that rises superior to
law' and evidence and all other mundane con-
siderations ; and his colleague, the judge with
rheumatism, backs him up in his proceedings,
and becomes an irresponsible being at the same
periods, and under the same circumstances. The
judge with corns is uncertain, and administers
the law best in dry weather ; he is governed by
barometrical pressure, and when he orders a
prisoner to undergo twelve months’ gaol for
stealing a jug it is generally a sign that rain
may he expected. As for the legal authority
who suffers from dyspepsia he is liable to break
out at all times and seasons, but after a public en-
tertainment where he generally hangs somebody
if the chance presents itself. And the moral of
this is that no man who is suffering from pain
or disease can be safely entrusted with the life,
or liberty of his fellow-man. The animal that
is in pain generally bites somebody by way of
getting square with the world at large, and
even a judge is only an animal with a large
salary after all. His conduct may be blindly
irrational, but as humanity in general acts
in the same way under the influence of the
same impulse, the result is only what is to be
expected. The individual who i« kicked by a


Use Batho’s Baking Powder.
An excess of animal food and a partial closing

jupepior power generally relieves himseli ny
kicking his inferior, and the latter passes the
injury on till it reaches someone so low down
in the social scale that he can find no one below
him to damage. In the case of the judge who
is infuriated by a pain in his stomach the
prisoner at the bar serves as a convenient
safety-valve, and unfortunately this latter
person has practically no redress. And for
these reasons it should be a sine qua non that
the administrator of the law should be sound in
body as well as in mind, and the race of old,
worn-out, diseased judges, who are soured by
gout, and aggravated by rheumatism, and
biased by brain-clots and partial paralysis,
and are eternally going away on leave, and en-
joying during their valetudinarian holidays,
the wages of at least twenty navvies apiece,
should be promptly abolished. Persons are
hanged often enough that jurymen may dine,
but the necessity of hanging them because the
judge is haunted by the ghosts of the drinks
and cigars which undermined his constitution
when he was young is not distinctly apparent.
Dear Bulletin, — The labour party will never
obtain political power in Australia until they
are organised on the American plan. Fiasco
will follow fiasco until they forget everything
they think they know, and follow the teaching
of experience. The Trades and Labour Council
has no business to meddle with the selection of
candidates at all. It should be the mainspring
of the political machine, and its function should
merely be the determination of the party creed.
The electors themselves should select the candi-
dates. To do this each electorate should
be mapped out and divided topographically
into fifty precincts. Persons appointed by the
Trades and Labour Council should call meetings
of the electors of each precinct, and at each of
these meetings an elector, residing within the
precinct, should be chosen as delegate to the
convention of the electorate. This body, com-
posed of fifty delegates, should then proceed to
select from amongst themselves, by the balloting-
out process, the candidate. The whole thing
works like a machine in America —the party
voting with the utmost solidity for the party-
ticket. I believe firmly in the residence-quali-
fication of candidates. A man’s next-door
neighbours are sure to know him well; and
it is surely an impertinence on the part
of a man to desire to figure as a candi-
date for a constituency if he cannot secure
the appointment of precinct-delegate. They
haven’t got the ballot in America yet; we have,
and I am convinced that the blending of the
American system of selection, with the Aus-
tralian system of election, would place a perfect
electoral weapon in the hands of the Australian
Democracy. If the Trades and Labour Council
like, I will show them how to put four labour
men in for West Sydney, at the general elec-
tion, no wrangling, no heart-burnings, a solid
organized party; and the whole thing should
not cost them more than sixty pounds.—-Yours
truly, J, A. Philp.
Just now philosophers of the cheap or
“ garden ” variety appear much perturbed over
the future of humanity, insoipuch as modern
Civilisation allows no play for natural inter-
sexual select ion and the survival of the fittest.
In the first place it may be observed that the
improvement of the human species is not
evolved by this agency as inbreeding simply
renders its followers increasedly inaccessible to
favourable alteration. Secondly, the concentra-
tion of wealth, intellect, and physical perfection
into a limited minority would not benefit
society but positively effect its deteriora-
tion. The general diffusion of the virtues
of the few among the vices of the many is
the sole logical path towards permanent race
improvement ! Presuming the world to be
divided into two sections, the one comprising a
select aristocracy of highly-developed organisa-
tions, and the other representing a horde of
ignorant, depraved, and deformed specimens,
the inevitable result must naturally follow —
the destruction of the former by the latter, a
period of anarchy and retrogression. No social
reform founded on exclusive lines rather than
absolutely inclusive principles ever spelled any
Other word than eventual self-defeat and failure.
HytLETf n brings under the special attention
of Mr. Gould, the New South Wales Minister
of Justice, the following extract from the Syd-
ney of JBth October. The italics are The
Bulletin’s ;
On Saturday, October U, the local courthouse was the
centre of attraction in consequence of the prosecution by
Mr. Mackat, owner of Bulgandranune station, of ten
shearers, who had left his employ when the shearers were
palled opt by the A.S.U. The evidence of Mr Mackay
went to prove that the men had engaged under a verbal
agreement, he having called Ins men up before shearing
commenced and said to theml require you to shear
under last year’s agreement. There are a number of you
here who shore with me last year, and, for the informa-
tion of those who did not, I may sav that the principal
Clause is that under which any man being discharged
before shearing is over will ho paid off at 17s. (id. per 100
sheep instead of £1 per fOO.” The men came and told
him they wanted to leave in consequence of the strike ••
hut he would not consent. The men, in defence, con-
tended that they had a perfect right to leave upon for-
feiting 3s. 6d. per 100. The Bench, however, lined them
£< each, and, in default, imprisonment. The money was
paid forthwith. 4 peculiarity iy connection with the
case is that magistrates were brought from Duhbo—ho
ijniles- to adjudicate on this case, whilst local magistrates
were kept in ignorance of the proceedings, and were,
therefore, unaware of the cases coming on. it is difficult
to understand the reason why four of the defendants weve
in the first place fined £5 each, when, at the instance of
the prosecutor, the fine was raised to £7.
bet us repeat a remark which we have made
fifty times in this connection : The administra-
tion of law in the bush by honorary magistrates,
chiefly representatives of class interest, con-
stitutes as shocking a scandal as did the
periodical rolls-up of honorary city beaks in
the bad old days when amateur J. ’sP. used to
assemble by the score with the deliberate inten-
tion of corrupting and over-ruling the decision
of the stipendiary magistrates.
Premier Gillies says he can’t just now find
time to introduce a one man one vote bill and
that he can make no promises as to the future.
And, says the Argus, anent the Strike division
in flic Victorian Assembly :—“lf this be a low
standard of political morality, we must remem-
ber that in democracies you cannot obtain a
very high one.” The poor Argus actually
tbinks it is living in a Democracy! With
plurality of votes ! ! Let the masses remember
that this is the fundamental question which, if
answered, would at one bound lift them on a
voting level (as to chances) with the classes. The
One-man-one-vote is the Excalibur that is able
to clear all obstructions which now prevent the
people themselves taking possession of their
own legislature. Turning to the Argus’s con-
tented statement that very high standards of
political morality —mark the word !—cannot be
obtained in a democracy, we have heard of a
Lincoln and a Garfield at least, in one demo-
cracy a little more democratic than Victoria’s.
U e suppose the Argus has a lofty assent for
the converse In moneyocracies you cannot
obtain a low standard of political morality.”
I lie mere statement of this antithesis is
sufficient to show how placidly the filthy old
ogre of shoddy ocracy sits atop of her mullock-
heap. It is almost a shame to disturb her state
of blind bliss by heaving a dead cat at her.
Once more the Argus barefacedly endeavours
to bolster up the Capitalistic position by
mendacious sophisms. The particular outrage
committed in the following sentence, i.e. , “No
man, unless a spendthrift or vagabond, need
ever despair of earning a competency and
becoming an employer himself after a salutary
period of probation as an employe,” calls for
immediate refutation for these reasons:—
firstly, the variations of social opportunity
which render it possible for a man who has
amassed a pile to lose the lot owing to the dis-
honesty or bankruptcy of his trustees or
creditors. Secondly, the difference of circum-
stances whereby a man may never be enabled to
raise his head above low-water-mark at any
time owing to ill-luck, bad health, or other
causes. Thirdly, the fact that the earnings of
labour barely suffice to enable any married or
intellectual man to exist upon, while the accre-
tive properties of mechanical contrivance, i.e.,
stored labour or capital, are daily increasing in
productivity and remunerative power while
those of labour are decreasing pari passu..
Given a man totally disabled physically, but
possessed of £IOOO cash, and a labourer with no
other capital except his inherent capacity for
work, it is possible for the former to create an
indefinite amount of wealth for himself therefrom
by the expiration of the year, while the latter can
be only worth a few paltry pounds at the best.
Fourthly, that as civilisation has advanced the
relative award of pure labour in proportion to
the aggregate wealth of the community has
diminished and not increased. The few
shillings a day more wages than those tendered
in past times have not been an equivalent re-
muneration considering the progressive standard
of average comforts. Fifthly and lastly, be-
cause there is no morality in parsimony at all
but a decidedly vicious feature, for the simple
reason that the abstinent man by lessening his
consumption reduces production and thereby
depreciates the collective standard of living,
throwing simultaneously his fellow-workers into
idleness. The mere fact of the existence of
wealth justifies man in availing himself thereof
for consumption. After these remarks have
been well driven into the wooden-head of the
above-named philosophical journal, perhaps it
may not be necessary to continue repeating these
well-worn truisms.
George Collins Levey writes about il onr
British ancestors, ” This is the natural retort to
those who locate the Ten Lost Tribes in the
British Isles.

Now sitting on the Government benches
in the N.S.W. Assembly are three Freetrade
members who are known to have recently assigned
their estates without going before their consti-
tuents. If they had gone, two out of the three
would probably not have returned.

time to examine things microscopically. Of late,

Adelaide Advertiser adv.:—

changed if wished. “ Pidea,” Waukaringa.
To give tall, dark and sedate girls a chance for

in the organ labelled “Conducted by A.
G. Taylor,” appears a lengthy biography of A. G.
Taylor aforesaid, whereof this is a modest slab:—
Such is the man who enters Parliament next Wednes-
day as the representative of West Sydney, and such are
his works. His works honour the man; and the man
honours his country. He is an Australian whose talents
and career make him popular among 1 his countrj'mcn
who very properly are proud of him.
The Bulletin is proud of him—of his oast-iron
cheek. What should not be possible to a man of
ability backed up by such impudence ?
The result of the West Sydney election is
a hopeful sign of the progress of Australian Re-
publicanism. The principal indictment of the
Sydney daily press against A. G. Taylor was the
not over choice way in which he alluded to Queen
Victoria, As the upholding of the Crown is the
first duty of the “loyal” citizen, it is fair to
assume that those electors who voted for Alderman
Taylor are loyal citizens, and that those who
voted for A.G. are disloyal. Imperialists may
take a little temporary consolation from the fact
that the {Kill only represents half the voting-
power of the electorate. But the Republican
answer to this is that loyalists who didn’t vote to
keep out so violent a republican must be a poor
and lukewarm lot.

“ Romeo find .Juliet,” as staged at Sydney
Royal, is chiefly to be commended as a series of
pretty pictures; viewed as a representation of
human life it won’t stand analysis. In
appearance, garb and gesture, Bellew is an ideal
Romeo, lint on first night ho was often inaudible,
and throughout chewed his words as if he enjoyed
them. Weakest when he attempted to depict the
lava-like warmth of an Italian lover, he got guyed
by the gallery in the balcony-scene for the series
of snorts that were intended to shadow forth the
difficulty with which he repressed hij amatory
Vesuvius. In his duel scenes, which had a family
resemblance, the fury, vigour and brevity of
the struggles were the hits of the evening.
In repose Mrs. Brown-Potter would have looked
Juliet had she not made up like a plaster-cast. As
usual, she did her utmost to destroy the mobility
of a very kissable mouth by laying colour thickly
thereon. The fair lady avers that she has never
seen Juliet played ; certainly hers is like no other
impersonation of the part that we have en-
countered, but then it is also unlike anything
under heaven. Had she served an apprenticeship
to her art she might have achieved greatness, but
she does not possess the genius that alone can
compensate for ignorance of technique, lack of
systematic training. It is attention to detail that
makes great impersonations, and Mrs. Potter is
not artificial enough to conceal her artificiality.
Her gestures are usually inappropriate, she is often
tragic when no emotional display is necessary, and
in nearly all her movements she is angular and
spasmodic. The Mercutio of Robert Inman is the
most even impersonation of the cast, and as one
critic asserts that he is too heavy and another
that he is too volatile, he must be just about
right, though we think a little more mercuriality
would be an improvement. Edward Sass plays
the Friar like a phonograph ; the Peter of Poulton
is acceptable as Peters go ; and Charles Westma-
cott, as the furious Tybalt, keeps folks awake
while he is about. Jenny Watt-Tanner is snuffed
out as Lady Capulet, and the Nurse of Mrs.
Edouin Bryer—she has been playing it over twenty
years—is a finished performance. John Brunton’s
scenery is very good.
* * *
As “Called Back,” despite small circles,
is running to bigger business than did “ Macbeth ”
at Sydney Her Majesty’s, it may be said to have
caught on considerably. It has been thought of
late that George Rignold had so fallen into flesh
and heaviness of spirit that it was impossible for
him to elude himself, but as Macari he upsets that
idea, and, acting with brightness and despatch,
gives an impersonation that is, probably, second
only to his Colonel Challis. The Ceneri of Brother
Bill, well-sustained throughout, is chiefly remark-
able for the intensity of his denunciation of the
traitorous Macari and the realism of his death-
scene. Kate Bishop was warmly welcomed back
to the stage, and though now-a days some-
what matronly for parts of this character,
she played, especially in the last act, with
all her old-time vigour. As Gilbert Vaughan,
Harry Jewett was inclined to be preachy and
over lugubrious, but when maudlin sentiment and
small talk (there’s a lot of both in “Called Back”)
were thrown aside, he was himself again ; Arthur
Greenaway was haunted with similar tendencies as
Kenyon, Miss Watts-Phillips makes the most of
Mary Vaughan, and the Anthony March of Harry
Hoyte was snappily and effectively played. Mr.
Clint’s scenery is creditable. By the way, in the
original cast at London Prince of Wales when
Beerbohm Tree played Macari, George Anson was
the Ceneri, Bellew the Gilbert Vaughan and Alice
Lingard the much-ill-used Pauline,

At Bondi Aquarium last Saturday a strong
gale prevented Mdlle. Viola from taking flight,
and so the seronatty little Australian seventeen-
year-old just walked round and made folks vow
they d conic and sec a little more of her next
Saturday. Jacques Ibbot, probably the fastest
man in Australia, has most suggestively pitched
his tent between the shark-pond and the donkey-
stable, where ho sits at the recoipt of sixpence
with nothing to do but curb bis appetite. He is
a well-developed, athletic young man with a set of
teeth that vainly crave active employment, and
seven doctors have testified that he is thoroughly
sound and in the possession of a magnificent
digestion, which he has for some years kept in
subjection by a strictly fruit and vegetable diet.
He started off on Saturday to live during forty
days on nothing hut filtered water and an occa-
sional hastily-grabbed mosquito. Eatnot—we
should say, Ibbot—weighed 12st. 21b. after his last
dish of apricots, and lost 6sb. during tne nrst Zi
hours. At this rate there will be nothing of him
left but a Saratoga and a full wardrobe at the end
of the period. Flynn, of Virginia, the General and
Lady Mite are in good buckle.

“ Harvest,” the new and beautiful play at
Melbourne Bijou, is a story of woman’s wrong
extending over a period of twenty years. Its
main idea seems to have been borrowed from
“ Man and Wife,” inasmuch as the prologue shows
how a young husband is inspired by a cynical
army captain to avail himself of a technical acci-
dent in his Scotch marriage with a tall, penniless
angel, in order that he may renounce her for an
amorous widow of boundless wealth, who dies
behind the scenes, leaving the conscienceless
caterpillar a prey to remorse, and a large landed
proprietor to boot. But when he finds old age
creeping o’er him, and the delights of the ballet
have turned to dust and ashes, and the shadow of
his expensive family tombstone darkens his little
bit of soul, why, then the insect drivels about the
unmarried wife he threw off, together with her
blue-eyed boy in the days when he didn’t want
’em.
* # •
The old Tory desire for an heir, one of his
own flesh and blood who will raise the rents when
he is gone, grows upon the old man as his lost
hair begins to come out on the comb. Then the
cynical military person, also become aged and re-
pentant, trots forth some more Scotch law to the
effect that if the other fellow finds the first lady
and marries her in the regular way, and the sight
of Heaven, all may yet be well. Meanwhile, the
deserted mother is waiting round the corner to
reap a harvest of vengeance from her crop of
sorrows, and when her son lias grabbed the flutter-
ing heart of his father’s stepdaughter, and the
father himself proposes to return like the prodigal
to the home of his offspring—that is where harvest-
time comes in. The tale of 20 years ago is un-
folded to slow music, and mamma bids her blue-
eyed boy come out of it forever, so that she may
gloat over an all-round scene of suffering and die
happy. But after a brief revelling in vengeance
the old lady allows her great moral purpose to
dissolve in a flood of tears, and the one aim of her
existence seems to be but vanity after she has hit
the bull’s eye. Womanlike, she has reckoned
without her “ feelings,” and finally takes back to
her breast the insect that stung her, whereupon
every other character in the drama makes for
matrimony.
* * #
Maud Williamson, whose bronchial tubes,
unhappily, trouble her more and more, is power-
ful and picturesque as the unmarried wife. The
part involves a continual overhearing of conversa-
tions and a persistent popping up at critical
moments, but Miss Williamson is a mistress of
broad effect, and never fails to throw life into the
stagiest of situations. Scorn is her trump-card,
and takes a big trick everytime she plays it.
Frank Cates, the husband, is good in the prologue,
but when he affects to develope into a remorseful
ruin the part leaves him astern considerably.
Titheradge is always right as the military friend,
though perhaps he might pile on a little more
penitence or the cool rascality of his advice re
the Scotch marriage. Emma Temple puts in the
prettiest bit of lovemaking she has yet accom-
plished on the Bijou stage, Lyndall is "more than
usually like the good young man who died, Fanny
Enson scores in a minor position. The humour,
which is occasionally strained and artificial, gets
justice from Boucicault and Pattie Browne, and
two of Spong’s scenes are noble works of art.
“ Harvest ” was written by H. Hamilton, who,
judging from his play, should be the coming man
in dramatic authorship.

The above is intended as a Gilbertian
expression of belief in a very bright future for

hearing the librettist’s share in the success seems
greater than Sullivan’s, whose melodies, especially
for the first act, are unusually suggestive of the
Established Church. Tte duets diffuse a strong
religious influence around the house, not to men-
tion secret fears that Williamson or Garner will
presently put his head out of the managerial box
to exclaim : “The Lord loveth a cheerful giver,”
and then come round with the plate. Much of
the music is delightful, however, and the opera
presents a gorgeous aspect throughout. Two
scenes by Phil. Goatcher (the Finn’s new artist)
and Brunton are as handsome as could be, and the
dressing, dancing, and stage-management, in fact,
all things save the cast, carry ad mi ratio' 1 by
storm.

Elton, Maggie Moore and Howard Vernon
are the only people who thoroughly meet the
requirements of their parts, and those parts are
not the most prominent. Ryley is a fair success
as the baritone gondolier, and Leumane repre-
sents the other one with more vivacity than was
expected, but the best that can be said of them is
that they easily hold their own with such apolo-
gies for operatic “stars” as Ida Osborne and
Flora Graupner. The former lady, although an
intelligent actress and a sweet iiasal warbler,
hasn’t a very paralysing personality on the stage.
Flora Graupner possesses no strong qualification
for the billet beyond a good singing voice, and is
out of place in any part that hasn’t been written
down to her figure. For the rest, pretty Florence
Young doesn’t yet understand how to speak liei
lines, and her amateurish performance in a com-
paratively important character is too painful to
dwell upon. It may be fairly supposed that such
a magnificent stage production has never before
been presented with so little regard for the
strength of its alleged supports.

THE LABOUR QUESTION,
Put out your tires and go to bed,
Is what the voice of Labour said.
The good old times have gone away,
The voice of Labour is here to-day
Eight hours’ work and eight hours' ease
And seek repose just when you please,
Such seems to be the latest rule
That is in vogue in Labour school.
Never mind; be of good cheer
And have your bottle of St. Louis beer
Be happy, mother, son, and daughter,
And drink Sarsaparilla and Iron water
“The Land of the Living” is another
piomising Melbourne show, which will keep the
Alexandra filled until Cup week is dead and done
for. It is a fine, full-flavoured article by Frank
Harvey, with a touch of the supernatural thrown
in to frighten the chief villain. The heroine
dream •> things that were happening in the other
act at the other end of the world, and as she is
relating her vision the parlour looking-glass dis-
closes a bird’s-eye view of darkest Africa, or some-
where, and she hears her husband’s voice singing
ten thousand miles away, which makes the villain
roll his eyes like a Christy minstrel. “Land of
(he Living” can give points to many worse
dramas, all the same, and it suits the Alexandra
down to the ground. There the boys follow the
story by way of the performers rather than of
their particular characters. They know Albert
Norman is the villain even before he rolls his eye,
and when Maggie Knight trips on, looking so
bright and cheerful, the boys heave a sigh for the
sufferings they know have got to come anon.
They likewise understand that Walter Howe is
an indestructible hero whose character is bound
to be cleared at the finish, and their knowledge of
what the future will bring forth for Mr. and Mrs
Bland Holt is founded on a solid rook of past
experience. It is good to be at the Alexandra on
a Saturday night.

Christie Murray’s surprisingly clever and
reposeful performance of Baron Hartfeldt has
been the only notable feature of “Jim the Pen-
man,” during another disastrous week at the
Royal. The theatre was to be closed after Tues-
day preparatory for something of a splash with
“The English Rose,” on Derby night. Closed in
the evenings, that is. To-day (Thursday) there
will be a big matinee show for the benefit of
Cogill Bros, who have lately struck hard times and
will be glad of a little ointment.

At the Opera House, where Sheridan’s

they are getting ready for “Paul Jones” on

two nights will see all the Melbourne theatres
engaged in a furious conflict of great attractions.
Meanwhile, the Gaiety and Victoria Halls look

Exhibition hippodrome and Harmston’s Circus.

The Palace Hotel, Melbourne, is a pleasant
place for any white citizen of quiet, unassuming
habits. It has been set on fire several times
within the last few weeks, and one night recently,
when business was particularly brisk, it started
into a blaze four times in four separate places.
Sometimes the combustion begins in a room which
is locked up, while the proprietor is sleeping on
top of the key for additional security, and at
other times the disguised’detective who is looking
for a clue goes out of a room to sneeze, and before
lie has got half through the operation the apart-
ment is full of kerosene and conducting itself
like a volcano. Occasionally a visitor takes a bed
at this combustible establishment and locks him-
self in, and plugs up the keyhole, and puts a chest
of drawers against the door, and fastens the
window and ties it up with a rope, and then five
minutes after he has gone to sleep someone builds
a bonfire underneath him and he has to run for
his life, making strong, promiscuous observations
as he goes. A watchman tramps over the pre-
mises all night, but when he goes upstairs some-
one generally fires the cellar, and when he rushes
down to look after it there is a flare-up on the
roof. A report that the incendiary set a light to
the proprietor happily proved unfounded, but he
and the water-tank are almost the only parts of
the building which have entirely escaped, and the
mental wear and tear promise to send everybody
concerned into a premature grave.

Ab the Adelaide Royal, Geo. C. Miln has
been vigorously rattling away at Shakespeare to
business which has been fairly satisfactory. The
tragedian’s best performances were in “Julius
Caesar” and “Richard the III.,” although taken
all round none of the representations can be voted
excellent. This is not wholly Miln’s fault; his
support has been rather tame, Miss Louise Jordan
m particular being thoroughly unsuited for the
parts she has undertaken. G.O. got rather
annoyed at certain local press criticisms at the
commencement of his season, and cleverly put on
the injured air, with the result that he got nothing
but sympathy from both press and public after-
wards.

At a Charters Towers amateur show some ballet-

looked at the Terpsichorean exhibition through his fingers,
wails forth in a leader :—“ When an amateur performance

Playing for the nonce at acting, surely it is too bad to
spring a mine upon them in the shape of a short-skirted
and low-breasted ballet performance. It is painful for us
to have to write in this strain, and goodness knows we
wish there was no occasion for us to do so, but when we
saw young girls hide their faces behind their fans ; when
we saw men look at each other with amazement depicted
on their countenances; when we saw young lads turn
away their heads with very shame, we felt if nobody else
would do so, that the Times, as the champion of the fair
fame of Charters Towers, would cry shame upon such

memorable and extraordinary in the theatrical records

with two or three of Dampier’s most popular dramas.
The Potter-Bellew receipts in Adelaide absolutely
broke the record since the Theatre Royal was built. The
cake was previously held by Charles Warner, hut this was
beaten by hundreds of pounds by the fair American and
her curly Kyrle.
Spagnoletti wagered that in nine months he would find
a sensational drama without the exclamation, “Hal you

Madame Patey, we read, says that Madame Melba is not
what may be accurately called a great singer, but she
bas, of course, a very fine voice, a perfect method, and,
above all, she has fallen into splendid hands. The De
'tezske brothers have taken a great interest in her, and
oavc been of infinite value to her in the developeinent of
exceptional gifts, and Royalty has “taken her up”
she is quite the heroine of the hour. She has been to

Th, ere was a terrible row among Gus Harris’s guests in
tne foyer" of Drury Lane on the first night of “A Million
Money.” Proceedings were opened by little James
M Neill Whistler, the eccentric Scotch-Yankee critic and
artist, lustily laying his cane about the shoulders of
Augustus Moore, while vociferating “Hawk! Hawk!”
Moore, a much taller and younger man, soon pushed or
knocked his fiery little foe to the ground, whence he was
raised and led away, jabbering and gesticulating angrily,
by some friends. Then the Irish blood of Horace Lingard
became eager for the fray, and, not satisfied with some-
thing that had appeared in Hawk, he aimed a blow at
Guss3 r , and the two were soon writhing in grips, but were
quickly separated before any damage had been done,
except to Moore’s hat, which was trodden out of shape.
Oisgustus ” is a snobbish person, who evidently requires

The London Referee says that Amy Sherwin’s selection
of songs at a late Covent Garden concert was simply
barbarous. Strangely enough this news didn’t come by
cable,
“ Carados” says that Charley Warner’s vigorous style
has not been chastened by visiting Australia. By the
" a ,y; judging from what we road of the plot in the
British papers, “A Million of Money” is cribbed from a
novel we read many years ago, and whose name we, just
now, forget, in which a humble and virtuous youth sud-
denly possessed of wealth, a lovely maiden and a w icked
uncle take chief part.

The Nellie Stewart Opera Company received a big

Johnny Sheridan quite poses as the author of the
“ Black-eyed Susan ” burlesque, Melbourne Opera House,
They couldn’t, find the MSS., so Johnny made it up all-out

Burnand. The press says Burn and wouldn’t be good
enough now a days, but as this punch is ladled out by the
MacMarn idol, it is perfection. If Muzzy re-wrote
■‘Hamlet,” the critics would wonder why they never
before saw the beauty of a three-act vers on, playing just
two hours, and ending with a gorgeous ballet on the
marriage of Hamlet and Ophelia.

Eyrie Bellew photographed some members of the

The Potter-Bellew contingent having given up their
proposed dramatic recital at Adelaide Town Hall in order
not to interfere with a trades-union demonstration, the
local Council passed a resolution which, it is said, has
been forwarded to every head centre in Australasia
directing the unions to handle all goods labelled “ Potter-

Referring especially to the parsons who went to see
Judah at the Shaftesbury, Spurgeon said, at his Taber-
nacle, on an off-night, that—“ The Christian Church of

Her pastors had filled a theatre of late, and had set their

Miss Polly Emery has entered into a life-long engage-

May we suggest to Mayor Burdekin the advisability of
removing Sydney’s £15,000 organ to his own back-yard
or any part of his premises where it can be conveniently
stowed away ? The instrument was not, so far as we
know, imported solely for his amusement, and though
the gentleman runs the Government of the country, like-
wise the Opposition, it is not evident that he absolutely
owns the right to throttle an instrument purchased with
public money.
Miss Ernestine Henriques was given a benefit concert
at Sydney Y. M. C. A. Hall the other evening, for the
purpose of raising funds to send her to Europe for the
completion of her musical education.
Says Herbert Standing: “It is, or was, a general rule
never to speak the last word of a play at rehearsals. In a
serious drama, 1 have known William Rignold and many
others, who, having a pathetic or dramatic part to play,
have spoken it correctly until they reached the last two
words, when, instead of completing it according to
‘book,’ they have deliberately turned it off into a jest,
rather than run the consequences of ill luck.”
Lady Dunlo’s favourite song, which illustrates but

There is a maid haunts Leicester Square,
She sells sweet flowers and roses fair ;
She is ’erself as fair as theiy,
And people parsing ’ear ’er saiy,
They’re fresh, fresh, fresh as the mornitv
Fresher than new-mown haiy ;
They’re fresh, fresh, very best fresh.
And they’re just wot you want to-daiy.
Old Mr. Brown, that good old man,
Went out one daiy the town to scan,

She’s fresh, fresh, fresh as the morning,
Fresher than new-mown haiy,
She’s fresh, fresh, very best fresh,
And she’s just wot I want to-daiy.
Oh, come, ’e said, now don’t be shy,
We’ll dine together at the “Cri.”
She turned ’er pretty ’ead awaiy,
A score of people Jyard ’er saiy*:
You’re fresh, fresh, fresh as the morning,
Fresher than newn-mown haiy,
You’re fresh,Yresh, entirely too fresh,
And you won’t do for me to daiy.
Back to Graft.
(FOR THE BULLETIN)
x’m going back to graft, it’s true, because I guess
we’re done,
Aik l see no sense in keeping on the battle just for
fun ;
There’s che wife to be con-idered —site’s a sticker-
up for “rights,”
But a mother can’t help thinking of the children's
appetites.
Maybe I am faint-hearted, and, perhaps, the
cause ain’t beat
But justice isn’t rent, my boy, and principles
ain’t meat;
The right side licks the wrong side if it only gets
fair play,
And yet how very often does the wrong ’un win
the day !
Our side was right enough, as I’m ready to main-
tain
(Though we stood to lose a lot, mate, and had
nothing much to gain)—
But our line was too extended for the forces at
command,
We must muster in battalions if we’d hope to
make a stand.
’Cause why? That’s just the question which it
doesn’t do to shirk ;
There is always surplus labour as is sneaking
round for work;
We could hold our own with masters, could us
Unions, no fear—
If the men as Avants our billets didn’t skirmish in
the rear.
We may call ’em dirty blacklegs, as I’ve called
’em, I admit —
But when the belly’s empty, Bob, one’s bound to
earn a bit;
We think they ought to join us out of sympathy,
although
It’s only when we're striking that they get a
decent show.
The strong ’tins, Bob, will always shove the weak
’uns to the wall
While Unions ain’t able to provide a job for all;
And this here blackleg labour—which the masters
call it free —
Is a-steadily increasing, mate, as far as I can see
Of course, they’re mostly loafers, with a turn for
getting tight;
.Suppose they joined the Union and kept them-
selves all right—
It wouldn’t alter matters for the better, not
until
A place could bo provided for each Unionist to
fill.
I’ve argued out the question with my conscience
and my wife,
And I can’t perceive no prospect of an ending to
the strife;
Big strikes of unskilled labour—meaning men like
me and you
Are “ narked ” by hungry beggars who will jump
at work to do.
And even those ships'-officers, who started this
here game,
Their trouble, more’s the pity ! Bob, is much
about the same;
It seems they’ll get concessions, which, I hope, as
how they’ll keep—
When an article is plentiful the money buys it
cheap.
There’s something dreadful rotten in the present
state of things,
Although they seem quite pleasant to the em-
perors and kings ;
The ruh are growing richer as the wages lower
drop ;
They say that Labour pulls a coach with Capital
on top.
A white-faced mob in England will be frightened
when they read
Of how we’ve lost our point, Bob, not to mention
wasted greed ;
But we shall come up smiling with a hopeful,
buoyant air,
And soon forget the failure. They will feel it over
there.
What’s the good of talking—for the moment we
are done:
There ain’t no sense in fighting losing battles just
for fun ;
I may be cursed and swore at, and I’m certain to
be chaff’d,
But the kids are short of tucker, so I’m going back
to graft.

It is cabled that the London Dockers
“ are now sullen and dogged in their demeanour.”
Carrying two-cwt. bags of salt for sixpence an
hour is just the tiling to make a man look chirpy
A cablegram says that “the Australian
beers shown at the Brewers’ Exhibition, at Isling-
ton, are much admired.'” Out in Australia we
don't admire beer. We simply drink it and keep
our opinion to ourselves.
It is cabled that the London dock com-
mittee announces its intention of offering the
dockers fair wages, with the right to pensions, and
will undertake to engage labourers without the
intervention of middlemen. It is marvellous to
watch what a lot these poor non-dividend-paying
dock-companies find they can do for the men now
that the latter have shown their teeth.
A vessel laden principally with beer went
down lately at the mouth of the Swan River and
the dreary city of Perth foresaw a cheap drunk
such as no inhabitant ever drank before. Every
man who could raise a boat was out fishing for
beer, and people who had no boats swam and
dived in search of beer, and fat men who couldn’t
swim went forth on rafts and gates and planks
and everything else that would float, and dragged
the beer off the bosom of the heaving deep. And
then, just when the drunk was fairly in progress,
the police came down with an intimation that
beer found drifting round at sea was the property
of the Crown, and so the grass withered, and the
Mower faded, and the sunshine vanished away,
fur the Queen has confiscated all the liquor that is
left. Evidently Her Gracious has an eye for any-
thing that is drinkable, but the next time a
wreck takes place at the Swan River, Victoria by
the grace of God may do salvage-duty herself.
Her loyal subjects are feeling tired.
You really ought to drink Wolfe’s Schnapps.
CORRESPONDENCE
‘’A Very Old One”: We also are surprised

indulge in such amusements “J.M.W.” (B.) : Your
friend the journalist will likely get himself into trouble.
• ...“Astar”: Nonsense! Such terms as "push,”
“graft,” “tucker,” &c., are convict slang, used before
Australia was discovered by C00k,... “Como” :If the
magistrates refused to renew the licenses of “ tied ”
houses, &c,, i.e., houses owned or controlled by brewers,
two-thirds of the present hotels of Australia would be
shut up.., “Northoote” : You aren’t a “ banker,” please
remember. “ Banker ” really means a man who owns and
runs a bank on his own account, and as there are prac-
tically no private banks in Australia, the nearest approach
to “ bankers ” here are the big shareholders, the Millers
and Bundles and such, who constitute the directorates
and control the operations of the chartered banks. A
cheeky little boy, with a book under his arm (and
a cigarette in his mouth when he sneaks into a

you could get the remainder of the doggerel you quote,

mentary candidate. You see, it doesn’t follow that adog,
because he can hold on to a pig’s ear, can catch a
kangaroo.... “ Low ” (Q.); Our deliberate opinion is that
possession of the faculty of enjoying a purely “ comic”
paper implies absolute idiocy. The English are the only
people we know of who run papers exclusively devoted to
weak drivel purporting to be “fun.” “ J.J.”
(Muckatah): We do not pay for matter other than
original —“A. Turton ” (E.W.) ; Well, if the strike has
“gonebad,” what does the soi-disant “free-labourer”
gain by it ? The employers, whatever they may say as
an association, are individually by no means prepared
each to turn his factory or yard into a hell-upon-earth by
insisting upon “free” and “union” labour working
together. The “ free-labourers ” will be fired out as in-
competent by their grateful employers, in the interests of
a quiet life. (2) The agreement of which you send copy
does not bind your employer to keep you on—as you
will probably discover in a very practical ' way

The Australian larrikin is, after all, but a
poor, ignorant savage as compared with his cousin
in dear old Hingland. “ Scuttling” is an art of
which the larrikin knows absolutely nothing. On
calm Sabbath evenings he is content to recline
against a verandah-post and curse creation between
his dark brown spits, or perchance he has enough
spirit of enterprise to kick a Chinaman, or heave
’arf a brick at a lame dawg— but no more. Mean-
while the rorty boys of Britain are venting their
older civilization in the “ scuttle,” a Sunday diver-
sion which radiates from the busy Manchester
district. There they have “ scuttling” clubs
for mutual improvement and the common weal.
Five or six members form themselves into a pic-
nic, and at a given signal whip out their clasp-
knives, and rush down the main thoroughfares
jabbing their weapons into the community at
large, who shriek furiously for the perlioe. Re-
cently a merry party of five “ scuttlers ” were
actually arrested by the Manchester constabulary,
and a dull, humorless Recorder inflicted severe
pains and penalties upon the quintette with a view
to the suppression of this healthful Hinglish
pastime. Evidence unfavourable to scuttling was
given by several mutilated citizens, two of whom
had lost an eye during the festivities, while one
was smarting under the indignity of a large gash
in the.interior. Scuttling is expected to go on
and prosper despite these proceedings, however,
and the comparatively apathetic larrikin of this-
country may hide his diminished head until he
learns to tighten the silken bonds by roaming
around promiscuously with somebody’s bright blue
eye on the point of his trusty blade.

A Remarkable Story.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The student of psychical phenomena may
find in the following strange story some elements
worthy of consideration.
It was a sultry evening in January. In the par-
lour of a neat little cottage that stood, surrounded
by shrubbery, in a quiet Melbourne suburb, there
sat a party of four, to wit, Brown and wife —the
owners of the house—and two old friends, named
Smith and Jones. Brown was one of the lucky
few that came out right during the great Bendigo
mining boom of 70. He realised a competence,
got married, and had retired into private life in
the spot where we now find him. On the other
hand, Smith and Jones were not so fortunate, and
were still adventurers. They had been extremely
unlucky for a long time, and their joint wealth
was now represented by a solitary ten-pound note.
But if they had little cash, they had an inex-
haustible fund of self reliance and internal
resource—a fair equivalent. Moreover, they had
been many years together, had gone through the
vicissitudes common to Bohemians the world over,
and were equal to either fortune, so that their
case was not so bad as it seemed. They had just
comedown from Bendigo, en route for Gipps Land,
and had broken their journey in order to spend a
few days with their friends, the Browns. Brown
and Jones, having mystical predilections, the four
were engaged on the night in question in a seance.
They had passed the initial stage and were now
thoroughly en rapport with the spirits, ten of
whom had signified their presence in the orthodox
manner. The raps did not come from the room,
but from various parts of the room, difficult to
locate; and Smith, who was sceptical, and attri-
buted their origin to physical causes, desiring to
ascertain if they were accompanied by any vibra-
tion, kneeled down and put his ear to the wainscot.
Just then a vivid flash of lightning lit up the
room, a deafening valley of thunderclaps followed,
startling the whole party. A, flickering light, like
a will-o’-the-wisp, hovered around Jones for a
second or two, and then disappeared. Owing to
the oppressive heat of the night the doors and
windows had been left open, but as the rain was
now falling, and the air was much cooler, Brown
rose and closed them, while his wife lighted the
lamps. Whereupon it was discovered that Jones,
who was a delicate man, extremely susceptible to
external influences, was in a cataleptic fit, or
trance. The Browns, much alarmed, wished to
send for a doctor, but Smith assured them that
it was not necessary, averring that the fit would
soon pass off, when Jones would bo none the
worse. This proved true. In half-an-hour Jones
was himself again, but as he complained of a
slight headache, and it was getting late, the party
broke up and retired for the night.
# * #
On the following day the two friends
walked into the city, when Jones proposed that
they should return immediately to Bendigo,
Smith, much surprised by his friend’s sudden
change of mind, demanded an explanation. There-
upon Jones informed him that during his trance
of the previous evening he had seen a rich patch
of gold lying exposed on the open roadway in
Blank-street in the city, at a given point
which they both knew well. At first, Smith
very naturally received this communication as a
joke, but when Jones declared his fixed deter-
mination to go and -see for himself, he hardly
knew what to say. The whole thing seemed too
ridiculous to talk about; but, nevertheless, after
exhausting all his powers of dissuasion, and find-
ing Jones still immovable, Smith finally consented,
under protest, to accompany him in his pursuit of
this phantasm, stipulating only thatnothing should
be said of it to the Browns,
In the course of the day, Jones succeeded in
procuring a poncho, after some trouble—for such
garments were things of the past—and in proof of
his faith he purchased a small stout leather bag to
oarry the gold ! And that evening’s Bendigo train
parried with it Jones and Smith, bound upon
what might fairly be styled the most insane
errand ever undertaken by sane men in this
prosaic age,
» * •
As the train rolled into Bendigo at
midnight, a heavy storm was passing over the
city, and the rain falling in torrents. Getting
into a cab, the friends were driven to the Sham-
rock Hotel, where they immediately went to bed,
and Smith was very soon fast asleep. As for
Jones, his overstrung nerves and morbid condition,
of mind put sleep out of the question. He lay
tossing about till daybreak, when he arose, and
after bathing his feverish temples, donned his
new poncho, an,d taking his bag under hia arm,
went downstairs, and was let out by the hall-
porter.
♦ *. •
The rain had long since ceased, but
the sky was still gloomy and overcast, there was
no one astir, and the city streets looked weird in
their emptiness. The constable on his beat stayed
for a moment his rhythmical tramp, and looked
reflectively after the draped figure hurrying by.
Jones moved rapidly on, his thoughts insensibly
coloured by the depressing outlook before him.
As he turned into Blank-street a slaughterman’s
cart dashed past, taking beef to the butchers in
the cool of the early morn ; throwing showers of
mud in. every direction, and awaking the echoes
of the silent streets in its rattling course. By h:s
aide ran, the freshly cut wheel-tracks, stretching
out in front, direct for the goal of his hopes.
Over at the station—no distance away—an engine
was getting up steam ; and as he glanced from,
side to sidp, at the shops and houses on, either
hand, the manifest incongruity between his in-
tensely realistic surroundings, and the ridiculous
character of his mission, sent a chill to his heart.
And all of a sudden, the tremendous absurdity of
his anticipations came upon him with the force of
a revelation. Greatly disconcerted by this new
aspect of things, and filled with misgivings, his
pace slackened in unison. As he slowly ap-
proached, with faltering steps, the point indi-
cated in his vision, a clock hard by struck “V.’
* * *
Just here, there was a considerable in-
cline, and the great thunderstorm of the previous
night having swollen the waterways enormously,
the rushing torrent had torn up the road in its
course, leaving behind a number of deep furrows
and water-pools. Beside one of these, elose to
the slaughterman’s wheel-tracks, Jones suddenly
stopped, mirabile dicta, there at his feet lay the
treasure-trove of his trance! There it lay, all
round the margin of the hole. Coarse gold and
fine ; nuggets of all shapes and sizes were there
washed nearly clean by the waters. Heavens!
What a sight ! So profoundly affected was he by
this marvellous realisation of his dream, that a
faintness came over him, his limbs shook, and he
feared he would fall; but this feeling quickly
passed off. He glanced nervously around him;
not a soul was to bo seen. Gathering up his
poncho he crouched down, and with eager, trem-
bling hands scooped into his bag fistfuls of the
dull yellow metal; half mud, of course, but what
of that? Handful after handful he gathered |
then, when he had secured the major portion of
the gold, the clang of a closing door warned him
that people were stirring. Desiring to avoid
observation, and not being very avaricious, he
determined to leave the remainder for the benefit
of the next comer. He arose, his mind in a tumult
and concealing the bag under his poncho hastened
hack to the Shamrock, where, awakening Smith,
he triumphantly displayed to his friend’s dumb-
founded gaze his wonderful golden harvest.
A PORTER'S ROMANCE.
At door of big Kawphy Pallis.
COUNTRY MAIDEN (giggling): “MOTHER, THAT’S SUCH A POLITE NAVAL
OFFICER STOPPING HERE. EVERY TIME I COME DOWNSTAIRS
HE OPENS THE DOOR FOR ME WITH SUCH A SMILE. AND, DO
YOU KNOW (blushing), I THINK HE WANTS TO PROPOSE
TO ME,”
MOTHER (gazing fondly at her offspring). “I SHOULDN’T WONDER AT ALL,
MY DEAR. IF HE DID.”
Meanwhile the lucky “next-comer”
proved to be a butcher’s boy driving some sheep
to lijs master’s shop in the city. He passed close
by the hole, and his quick eye perceiving the gold)
Which remained lying scattered around, squatted
down and began picking it up. He was very soon
joined by a chum, and whilst the two boys were thus-
agreeably engaged), a man came along, who, seeing
there was a good tiling on, ran, for a shovel and’
dish, and cleaning out the hole carefully, panned
out a good many ounces.
The local papers of the following day stated
that the man and two boys netted over a hundred
pounds worth of gold between them. Not so
bad, before breakfast. Upon a careful examina-
tion of the ground it became evident that it had
been the site of an. old camp, and that the gold
was a “plant ” buried by the owner for safety, in
the early days, of the field when murder and!
robbery were common. The workmen, in forming
the road, had gone within a few inches of it, and
the rushing waters had done the rest.
• # #
Row much. Jones netted! the veracious
chronicler knoweth not. But he and Smith may
no longer be classed as _ adventurers ; being, at
the present time of writing, comfortably settled
on a snug little property of their own. in “sunny
New South Wales.” They often visit their friends
the Browns, and many a seance the four have held;
since that fateful, one of the trance. -Jonas has.
had no. more visions ; but, as might be expected,
he plumes himself not a little on the happy results
of the last, averring that “second-sight runs in
the family.” As for Smith, his scepticism is com-
pletely routed, and to suoh an extent has his res-
Eect increased for all things occult, that he declares
is readiness to accompany Jones on a like expe-
dition whenever he desires, to the uttermost ends
of the earth, if need be.
J. LYALL.
A Death Strike.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
In the year 188— I was surgeon-superintendeht of
an Australian benevolent asylum, and had under
my care some six or eight hundred old and indigent
men. They necessarily were recruited from the
poorer working-classes, though occasionally some
who had occupied far different positions came
under our notice. I now narrate one of the many
strange incidents of asylum life of which I was an
interested spectator.
The winter of the year mentioned had been Very 7
wet and severe, all the country around was more
or less flooded, and the aVerage daily mortality of
the poor old inmates, through the dampness and
inclemency 7 of the weather, had been very high.
The cemetery where the dead were buried was
situated about half-a-mile from the Asylum, in
rather low ground, and great difficulty had been
experienced even in former years in keeping it free
from soak age. This year, however, was such an
exceptionally damp- one that towards the end of
the winter the cemetery was practically sub-
merged, the- coffins having to be held down and
the earth piled' quickly on them to prevent them
from floating.
One morning one of the wardsmen of the Asylum
informed me that a deputation of the old men
were waiting to see me.
Poor, battered, old waifs 1 It was a pitiful
sight. The drift from the seething, bubbling*
restless sea of life —what heart-stirring tales their
seamed and wrinkled faces told !’ Their ages
ranged from- GO to 90> years, and the dozen that
stood before mo represented how many noble-
hopes, ambitions, and aspirations—doomed, alas,
never to be realised and to end —oh, how miser-
ably ?
“ We’re wishin’ to* spake to yer banner,” blurts
out old Mick. “ llech mon,” says Donald
Maolvor, “eanna .ye baud ye tongue, didna’ ye a’
agree that it’s me that’s to speak to the doctor ?”
“ Well, doctor, we’re wishful to say that we’re
sore disirest at the state of the burying-ground,
and we have come to ask you if it cannot be
changed’. To think that our bodies will lie soakin’
and soakin’ till the Day of Judgment is more than
a good Christian body can put up with and we
have decided’ that we will not die nor be buried in
such a-water-hole.”
Donald always spoke the broadest Scotch if
excited, and I have omitted most of his collo-
quialisms.
Having been assured by mo that the mattei
would be attended to, the deputation departed
my ears catching, amid the retreating noise of the
shuffling feet, “ Ye’re right, Donald, we—refuse
—die—Tim —Flanigan—floatin—t-h-e-r-e— y-e-t.”
I had the place drained, but all to no purpose
and soon after wrote off to obtain authority to use
another piece of ground. The reply giving the
necessary consent of the authorities without which
interments could not take place, was not received
for three days, and, strange to relate, not a single
death occurred during that time among the old
men.
I received an answer on the tmrd day, ahd im.
mediately informed the old fellows of the new
arrangement, and from that day the average daily
mortality among them Was maintained, and they
died off in peace.
I should state that up to cnis there had ne vet-
been less t han two deaths per diem in the Asylum;
and they ranged sometimes as high as five or six, so
that the three days’ death-strike was unparalleled
in the history of the institution, has never been
known to occur since, and is, furthermore, the
only strike ever recorded in its peaceful anhals.
RICHARD VINCENT.
It is stated that the insurance losses by
reason of the great Sydney fire are so great that
they cover five years’ premiums on all Sydney
property insurances.
Capt. Edie, of the U.S.S. Co.’s fleet, is to
succeed Capt. Brown as Shipping-Master at Syd-
ney. Capt. Edie has a first-class record, and is
one of the most popular captains who have ever
commanded a ship in these waters.
Judging from their recent speeches, it
would seem that Messrs. Carington, Hopetoun
and Kintore are under the impression that they
a phenomenal trio, and were sent out by way of
making ‘ ‘ a new departure ” in the art of colonial
governorship. At least they state unanimously
that they are “a new departure,” and what in
thunder they are driving at no one knows except-
ing themselves. It is true that Oarington is
going to depart, and that the wives of Hopetoun
and Kintore have departed already : but if this
is the cause of all the row the subject might as
well be dropped.
The latest game of the Melbourne capi-
talists is the formation of an association to induce
British and Irish labourers and artisans to emi-
grate to Victoria “on terms.” If they’re
“good” and “respectful” for long enough, the
cost of their passages is to be repaid them. The
Argus is making a big mouthful in accepting
custody of subscriptions towards the new
the first two or three donations received being
cheques for £lOOO each. The senders of these are
so far keeping their identity dark. The new
strategy may look brilliant to the monopolist-
employers, but we are content to let them flap
their pinions how they please. Socialism cannot
be stayed by all the forces of united classdom.

also added to the debt—in fact, he consistently
refused to pay anything. When the bill had rim
to £14,000 he gave up the transaction and died,
and then his intelligent father forcibly collected
the balance of the policy, and a noble British
family is consequently £30,000 ahead. Also, a
badly-astonished company pays £20,000 for the
privilege of lending the deceased heir £lO,OOO
without interest, and insuring his life at its own
expense ever since the year 1879 !

The greatest curiosity at Versailles is a

South Australia has decided on free edu-

free and absolutely secular. In N.S.W. it is only
compulsory, which is unjust, considering that it is
there neither secular nor free.
Ex-Treasurer Burns, (N. S. W.), has just

From Western Mail (Cardiff, Wales)
THE GOVERNMENT OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA,
formation of a new ministry.
(rEctke’s telEgram.]
Brisbane, Friday.
The new Ministry has been formed, of which Sir S. W
Griffiths is Premier.
So much for England’s interest in her kawlinies.
It is proposed in the N.S.W, Parliament
that the Premier’s salary be raised from £2OOO to
£3500, and that of several other Ministers from
£l5OO to £2600 and from £l5OO to £2OOO ; also, that
the Agent-General get £5OOO annually. Either
the country is paying the Civil Service too much
or it is paying its chief political servants far too
little. The N.S.W. Chief Railway Commissioner
gets £3OOO yearly and his subordinates £l5OO, and
the Chief Justice gqts £3500, or £l5OO a year mow
than the Premier,
Said Thos. H, Green, the historian, when
a youth Fools'.talk at Oxford of its (the for-
mation of a rifle corps) being desirable, in order
that the gentry may keep down the chartists in
the possible contingency of a rising. I should like
to learn the use of the arm, that I might be able
to desert to the people, if it came to suck a pass. 5 '
And, by the way, what do the Australian labour-
organisations intend to do in the matter of having
workmen represented in the volunteer forces by a
due proportion of officers ?
Mr. Lakeraan, M.L.A., suddenly arose in
the N.S.W. Assembly last week and wanted to
know what the Governor meant by “giving per-
mission ”to the House to elect its Speaker ? The
Premier loftily replied that the formality “ had
been the practice in the English Parliament for
200 years,” The sentiment of this is right against
Young Australian opinion, which asserts that
instead of Parliament asking permission from the
figurehead, the figurehead will have to ask per-
mission from Parliament.
Cursing from the hustings and road-metal-
throwing at elections are only survivals of Aus-
tralian lag-time. They are things calculated to
damn the cause of the sober workman., and are
eagerly seized upon by his enemies as a means of
linking him and his cause with the gaol-bird and
the loafing drunkard. The armed forces of the
country could be put to no better use than to
uphold the right of free speech, by dragooning the
ruffians who throw filth., and missiles dangerous
to life, at candidates for Parliament.
Said Frank Cotton’s weekly paper :
In the present conflict the electors of West Sydney have
the pleasing option of being defeated by the accumulated
property votes behind Mr, John Taylor, or disgraced by
the return of Mr. A. G. Taylor. To say that the unionists
have any prospect of being represented is to insult the
good sense of every man who has any sense ot self-
respect.
This is a very fair statement of a condition of
affairs which makes us doubt the possibility of
regenerating Parliament. If men of the Taylor
stamp are the best that can be induced to come
forward as candidates for the suffrages of one cf
the premier constituencies -of N.S. Wales, how
can one expect studious, intellectual, well-behaved,
sober men to be returned for the outlying con-
stituencies ?
N.S. Wales, in (at the instance of The
Bulletin) devoting Treasury money to the de-
fence of capitally-arraigned prisoners, has again
got ahead of England
When (remarks Labouchere) a prosecutor is too poor to
pay counsel to prosecute, the State retains counsel for
him. Why, then, should it not do the same for prisoners
who are too poor to pay for their own defence ? Surely
the State is not more interested in obtaining the convic-
tion of criminals than in preventing the conviction of in-
nocent men ?
That is what The Bulletin has argued for years.
And now that the question has been satisfactorily
disposed of, so far as N.S. Wales is concerned, let
ns propound the next question which arises on the
road to legal socialism—“ Why should a man who
is simply accused of and has not yet been found
guilty of a crime be put into an iron cage to take
his trial?” We do not think that the fact of a
man being placed behind spikes like a wild and
dangerous beast ranch influences the mind of an
experienced presiding judge, who has so often
seen men cage-tried whom he felt to be innocent.
But the jury, less accustomed to the forms of
criminal law, are invariably prejudiced by the en-
oagement of the prisoner at the bar.

Hopetoun told the grovellers of Sandhurst
that Lady Hopetoun had sailed from Adelaide in
as good health and as good spirits as could be ex-
pected under the circumstances. What circum-
stances ? And what sort of health and spirits was
the Governor’s brother-in-law enjoying when he
sailed ?
* # #
Lady Jersey on her arrival will find the
coast absolutely clear. Not another Governor's
wife will be visible in Australia.
* * *
On the Collins-street block are shown
group-photos of the Hopetoun entourage, with
the principals smirking in the midst. The star
beauty nowadays is decidedly Capt. de Moleyns,
who is pointed at all day with long-handled Lady
Teazle parasols at a safe distance. He has a very
stagey left eye, one of the sort that looks round a
Toorak corner. He is a distinguished amateur
theatrical, and people vainly hoped to see him ere
his departure in “Delicate Ground” and “Out on
the Sly.”

Lady Jersey, it is cabled, is suffering from
typhoid-fever, and Jersey cables his apologies for

Some time ago The Bulletin commented
on the fact that Gov. Kintore had re-named the
township of Innanimcka “Hopetoun,” thus re-
jecting the native name. The S. A. people are
firm about the absurdity of the new name, and,
led by the Reoikter, still call the place by its old
appellation. All Australians would do well to
stick to the same principle in future and thus put
an end to the present system in a practical way.
Those who would bestow old-world names (such as
“ Sandhurst ” for Bendigo) upon Australian
localities can have no belief in the future import-
ance of this country among the nations. A few
years since a vulgar little cockney local coterie
sought to efface the old historic name of Manly
Beach and substitute therefor “ Brighton,” and a
systematic attempt is being made to re-christen .
the townships on the Parramatta River after
places abutting on the Thames. In this con-
nection, The Bulletin hopes one day to see a
rational name bestowed on “N.S. Wales,” and
with a view to helping on a cognate reform, now
alludes to Maoriland for the very last time as
‘New Zealand. ’
# * *
A few years ago, the inhabitants of the
“ Tight Little Island ” having good reason to be
ashamed of certain associations inseparably con-
nected with the name “Van Dieman’s Land,”
altered it to “Tasmania.” It has now been dis-
covered that Tasmania anagrammatised is “ I am
Satan.” They can’t get away from him anyhow.
* * *
A small family difficulty has broken out in
an aristocratic household of the Far West. Some
few months ago a new slavey came out to the
station, and the son and heir fell a victim to the
charms of this artist in hash. She had a com-
plexion of milk and roses, and she could sit down
on her hair when she was tired, and her arms were
round and white, and in addition to all these
things she wore a smile that broke the young man
up altogether. He wrote 28 letters to her with a
promise of marriage in each one, and then his
mother found it out and raised a whirlwind. But
when she had screamed herself hoarse she had to
come down from her pedestal and argue the point
with the goddess of hash, and the lowest price the
goddess would take for the correspondence was
£5OO. She got the money at last, and then went
straight on with the proceedings as if nothing had
happened. She has got 37 more letters from the
young man now, and unless she gets £BOO for them
the marriage will take place in a few days. Woman
js a most unreliable animal.

“ A lady and gentleman, who, although
amateurs, would take a foremost position on the
regular stage.” Such was the criticism, in the
homeward tram, on a couple who figured in the

Sydney Echo is persistently attempting
to name the big new local street “Jersey Avenue!”
Isn’t it a little too early to grovel to a man whom

in the matter, surely, so far as notoriety is con-
cerned, it is Lady Jersey who claims considera-

certain that the strikers have spent £200,000 in
drink during the last 12 months—which huge sum
would have maintained them and their wives and
families for over six months. Mr. Clark and his
friends can’t get over their idea that tea always
means virtue and never dyspepsia and that the
expenditure represented by the English, German,
American and Australian workman’s beer and the
Frenchman’s vin ordinaire is all sheer waste and
wickedness. Mr. Clark’s present comments recall

Price consists of an Imperial major-general, a

The Bulletin sincerely sympathises with
Mr. T. B. Gibbs, a man who, during a long busi-
ness career, has earned the respect of his employes
and the community, in the position in which he is
placed as chief witness at the inquest concerning
the great Sydney fire. Mr. Gibbs is a man of
much energy, who, persistently dogged by ter-
rible luck, has ever bravely shown a bold front to
the world. We dare say Mr. Gibbs would have
been quite ready to give privately to the insur-
ance-offices and authorities, even on oath, all
necessary information concerning his private
affairs, but it is rough indeed that a man with a
square name should have to stand up in open
Court and (Under penalty of attaching to himself
an imputation that he had a lot to conceal) be
compelled to answer, in an enquiry ostensibly
referring to the direct cause of a tire, every ques-
tion asked him in the course of what in lawyers’
phrase is termed “ a fishing expedition.”

Governor Hopetoun states that he has an
engagement on hand for every day of the next
three months. That is to say he has got to feed
at a banquet, when he could feed finite as well at
home j or else he has to open a bridge, or a barn,
or a public building which would serve its purpose
quite as well if there was no official opening at
all; and in between these important duties he has
to go to some place which has so far managed to
crowd through without him, and make a dead and
exhausted speech about nothing. A Governor’s
life is an arduous one nowadays. So is the life of
the Indian fakir who undertakes td stand for a
quarter of a century or more on one leg and it is
quite as intellectual.

“ Why,” asks John A’Dreams (James
Runoiman), “does the British male say ‘My Dear’
to the wife of his boßom when he hates her most
direly ? and why does the British female return
the compliment when she only regards the male
as a trapped animal whom she will skin alive until
his life-policy enables her to skin him dead?'
And then John goes on “to give the real though'
behind the nauseous verbal caress :
To “My Dear.”
Your face is mean ; your vulgar moutn,
Primed with a long-lipped feline sneer,
Seems aching with perpetual drouth—
A drouth of whine, and snarl, and jeer.
The muddy reaches of your soul
Are strewn with rotten wrecks cf lies ;
The slimy currents foully roll;
Their surface glitters through your eyss
You sanctimonious cockatrice!
Were all the pulpit’s babble true,
I’d steep my soul in cankered vice
For fear of sharing Heaven with you.
You stab ray heart with dastard speech J
You slay the new-horn waifs of good ;
All hell alone had power to teach
Your callous, flaunting hardihood.
A poet once lived in my heart,
And made me glad for many a year ;
You did not kill him with a dart,
You smothered him in filth, My Dear.
All ! dear, dead poet, rise again,
And make the joyous choirs resound,
Your song should cheer the sons of men—
Alas ! He testers underground.
And pray, what does all this mean ? Simply that
John finds marriage prosaic.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JoNEs and Robinson lately essayed to ‘ ‘dri ve a coach-
and-four” through the N.S.W, Crown Lands Act.
Brown and Jones are neighbouring squatters out
West, their runs are contiguous, and they hate one
another like poison. Brown is a big man, even for
the West, Jones is only “ small potatoes ” in that
region, but anywhere else his run would be con-
sidered big enough. One day Brown, alluding to
the size, or rather want of size, of Jones’ run,
called the latter a “ boss cocky.” Gall and worm-
wood ! This to a real live squatter ! The soul
of Jones was at once possessed with ideas of
revenge.
About this time Jones fell in with Robinson ; I
cannot describe to you the business of this last-
mentioned better than by saying I d.n’t know
what he isn’t or hasn’t been ; I could tap him on
the shoulder within five minutes’ walk of Sydney
G.P.0., but beyond this I will not particularise.
J Siting on Robinson’s advice, Jones decided to
take up a number of homestead leases on Brown’s
resumed area, and a vague sort of treaty was entered
into. Things had to be vague at this stage, because
under tHe penal clauses of the N.S.W. Land Act
anyone inducing anyone else to be a dummy, or
illegally to take up a homestead lease is liable to a
term of imprisonment with hard labour not less
than six months and not exceeding two years.
Jones was to find the dummies and take up five
blocks of 10,240 acres each. Robinson was to find
the sheep and would, when the homestead leases
Were granted, finance matters so that the improve-
ments would be paid for. J ones hied him back
to bis station, and about a month afterwards five
were taken up on Brown’s resumed area,
the applicants being a stockman, a horse-breaker,
a gardener, a boundary-rider, and a nondescript—
all in the employ of J ones.
“Dashed unneighbourly thing to do,” said all
the western squatters, and Jones was boycotted
by them from that day forth.
“But his troubles had only just begun, he had to
send these five men into town to lodge their ap-
plications at the Lands Office. This necessitated
five sums of £42 13s. 4d. each being planked with
the Crown Lauds Agent, and five “sprees” and
their incidental expenses; the immediate result
being that Jones’ solicitor had to bail out of the
look-up two of the applicants next morning•
finally, they were got back to work, but in a
month or two’s time the applicants had to attend
before the Land Board again, which meant five
more sprees, and Jobes had to part with five more
cheques before his “ dummies” would return to
duty.
Meanwhile Robibsoli had sebt ob to Jones’ own
run the sheep that Were to be depastured on the
homestead leases as soon as the necessary pre-
liminaries had been arranged, and they naturally
required a well-watered paddock to depasture in,
a paddock Well worth £l2O a inobth, as time- go
out West. By this time the survey fees on the
lease applications were due and had to be paid.
They varied from £l5 to £25 on each—say £lOO in
all. Jones paid this and thought it high time he
saw after the “ financing ” proposed by Robinson,
as the improvements, amounting in all to nearly
£2OOO on the five leases, had to be paid within 90
days from gazettal.
The virtuous Robinson, at this stage, wanted ab
agreement signed that practically involved Jones
into admitting that he was an employer of dum-
mies. This the latter declined to sign, and the
former demanded then a lump sum to be “ bought
out.”
“There’s nothibg to buy you out of,” said
Jones.
“I’ll get the leases cancelled,” replied Robin-
son. “ I’ll see Brunker and tell him they’re all
dummies.” And the pair parted wrathfully.
So far Jobes’ ordinary banking-account had
carried him along well enough, but when it came
to finding a couple of thou, for improvements, the
assistance of a finance company had to be called in.
Before their row Robinson had introduced him
to the managers of a couple of these institutions,
and to one of these gentlemen Jones now betook
himself. “ Five homestead lessees wanted certain
advances, they were prepared to mortgage, &c.,
&c., the leases had already been gazetted, the
improvements consisted of so-and-so, and with
expenses, amounted to £l9B0 —would the company
advance it?”
“Well, you see,” said the manager, “Mr.
Robinson has been here and he has notified us
that he was interested with you in this matter,
but as he found reason to doubt the bona-jules of
these applicants he has withdrawn. Of course,
my dear sir, I do not imagine there is anything
wrong with them, but my directors, you know,
have to be consulted, and I am afraid that we
cannot oblige you, Mr. Jones.”
A similar reply was received from the manager
of .the other institution to which he applied, and
after vainly carting his proposals all over Sydney
Jones returned West a sadder and a wiser man.
When the 90 days elapsed the leases fell in
because the improvements were unpaid, and
Brown laughs in his sleeve whenever anyone talks
of homesteading his resumed area. Robinson
took his sheep away from Jones’ place, declining
to pay one penny for their depasturing, and the
latter didn’t dare “Court’’him over the matter
lest the foregoing incidents should come to light.
Homestead-dummying isn’t always cakes and
ale. Jolies’experience in this cost him well nigh
£4OO, and there is not a madder man out West.
Wolfe’s Schnapps—lt is grand.
An enterprising Sydney firm lias published
a large sheet containing 28 pictures of the R.O»
hierarchy of Australasia, the central figure being,
of course, that of Cardinal Moran. As a large
number of the faithful run pubs., the picture-
runners have invaded every whisky-mill bearing
an Irish name, only to find that the owner’s
veneration for the Cardinal as a churchman is
swallowed up in his disgust at the teetotal prin-
ciples of his Eminence. “ The Kyardinal’s prach-
ing, ye see, takes the bread out of our mouths,
and we have no money to buy his likeness wid.”
A good bed companion— Wolfe’s .Schnapps.
The other day an old Maori entered the
A; Land Court, and solemnly nailed a big pic-
ture ou the wall right opposite the Judge. It was
the picture cf a cow surrounded by a crowd of
people, some Of them pulling her tail, horns, and
other outlying features, while several others were
bUsily extracting the coW-juice from its receptacle
regardless of the fact that the starving calf stood
by. “What is that?” asked the Judge with a
scoWl. “ The cow,” replied the rangatira, “ repre
sehts the ancient Maori race of which 1 myself
ain an unworthy specimen ; the parties who are
milking it are the land-jobbers, judges, lawyers

ENOUGH FOR MY READERS.”
and other sharks, while the starving calf repre-
sents the Maoris who are being robbed of their
birth-right.” Whereupon the chief and his offen-
sive picture were fired out by the police.
“ Once upon a time,” says Arnold White,
writing on food-adulteration, “there were three
flies. They were common flies, who inflicted the
same annoyance on the persons who occupied the
house as others of their race. But these three
flies were as devoted friends as Athos, Porthos,
and Aramis. One clay the three friends started
for a journey in the noontide heat in search of
something to eat. In due time they came to a
loaf of bread. One of the flies, ravenous’ with
hunger, settled on the bread in advance of his
friends. Alum was in the bread. The digestion
of the fly was unfitted to grapple with alum, and
he shortly died in great agony from spasmodic
contraction of the coats of his stomach. Oppressed
with grief, but still hungry, the two survivors,
who were spared by the impetuous appetite of
their dead friend, continued to search for food. A
bowl of sugar came in sight, of which the younger
of the two eagerly availed himself. But,
alas! the sugar was prepared with sulphuric
acid, and again a hapless insect was done
to death. Desolate and sad, the survivor
reviewed the situation, found he had nothing left
to live for, and resolved on putting an end to his
existence. He looked around for some instru-
ment by which he could leave a world that had no
further interest for him. Spying a fly-paper, he
resolutely plunged his proboscis into the lethal
surface, and resigned himself to death, with his
wings modestly folded around him. But the fly-
paper was adulterated, and he found, instead of
death, a healthy and stimulating meal.”
The Tip From Down Below.
( FOR THE BULLETIN .)
j.t was in the stilly night,
As I lay in bed a-thinking,
That a spectre white and “ tight *
(He had certainly been drinking)
Staggered through my bedroom door—
Eor a door can’t stop a vision—
And he squatted on the floor
With an air of calm decision
Somewhat comic, in a sense,
Though it made me feel creepy ;
I muttered : “ Get you hence—
Don’t you see I’m very sleepy ?”
But he didn’t go away,
He squattered there and sniggered ;
I knew not what to say,
So hazarded : “I’m jiggered !”
Which was certainly the case,
Yet a shorter word and ruder
Had been scarcely out of place;
Then this horrible intruder
Put his finger to his lip,
As Villains do in dramas.
And grunted, “Here’s a tip
You can back for your pyjamas.”
He breathed a bluish light.
Like that of fairy taper,
And then 1 saw him write
Upon a piece of paper ;
He did not scratch his head
Nor o’er his poem linger,
He had no pencil lead
* But wrote it-with his finger ;■
He held the paper up
Exhorting me to heed it :
■ “The winner of the Cup”—
What could I do but read it ?
• • *■ • • a

A 11 his rivals, save the one,
L eft again behind the second.
D own the straight he fights with fate,
£ quine hero colossean I
A nwin, with his lighter weight,
N abs him on the dark Chaldean.
The spectre rose and sat
Upon my couch, or sofa,
And softly coughed and spat
Just like a certain Loafer
Of whom you may have read
In lines of greater merit —
Thought I, “The Loafer’s dead,
Perhaps this is his sperrit
That twelve long months ago
Across the Styx was ferried ;
Bedad ! I ought to know,
I paid to have him buried.”
fie breathed a brighter flame—
(Not bluish, but a red ’uu],
I saw he was the same ,
Old wreck I’d left a dead ’un
The day when last we met,
Whose shrunken form I’d leant o’sF—
Ah ! could I e’er forget
The man who told me Mentor ‘i
And then as quick as thought
1 grasped the situation —
The Loafer’s wraith had brought
Some “splendid information.”
“ Ah ! is it you once more ?”
Quoth I, “ you wretched boozolf,

You Vow’d he’d prove the wiruiGß
What happens after death

‘ Here is a liar lying

The spectre stooped to spit,
Then answered, rather sadly t
“ ‘Tis true, I must admit,

“They say that spirits walk,"
I answered, with a stammer j
“ How comes it that you talk
With some regard for grammas
Vour language Used to be
Not fit for ears of ladies,”
The spectre said, said he—
“ I’ve learnt a lot in Hades |
I’ve studied much of late
The Latin roots, with Remus,
And I’m Boet Laureate
To His Highness NicodemUs,”
“ Mais reveUons tl nos moutons,

Not with any of my sago.

And he’ll beat both stable mates,
Aye,, and get in front of Melos.
You can back old Carbine, rare,
For a place, and he’ll annex it j
But I sniff the morning air,
So had better make my exit.”
The spectre said “Good-bye,”
And quite Mephistophelean
Was the twinkle in his eye
When he added : “Back Chaldean j
Lot me your Mentor be,
As once I was aforetime;
I’d tell you all, you see,
But I haven’t any more time.”
Then he vanished through the door,
Which was locked, there’s no gainsaying
And I haven’t seen him more,
Though I seem to hear him saying—

Australian beer, it is cabled, is much
admired at an English show. From a distance,
we presume—or perhaps it was brewed specially
for exhibition. The Bulletin is freetrade in one

Wolfe’s Schnapps—the ladies appreciate it.
In West Australia (rather indefinite, this)
a publican has living with him a (Queensland black
gin who, arrayed in clean moleskins and a coloured
shirt, entertains his guests. She gallons round on
the back of a buck-jumper which she handles with
consummate grace, and when she drops into town
with a few friends she walks into one of the bars
and says in a most manly way, “ What are you
going to have, chaps?” The lady is universally re-
garded as a perfect treasure.

“In the matter of docking horses,” writes
Mr. William Butler, of Kilcoy, “I find that
two joints off the tail makes a better tail for
keeping off flies than leaving it bs natural length.
In the latter case the hair often forms into a
matted lump.” After this, when we want to
express omniscience we’ll nev r speak of the
Almighty. We’ll speak of Mr. William Butler of
Kilcoy, the man who can teach Nature how to
arrange horses’ tails with relation to flies.

In this issue is an advertisement of Messrs.
Caldwell and Company, of Melbourne and Lake
Albert Vineyard, Wagga Wagga. The business
of this firm, which is one of the oldest and most
extensive in Australian wines, was about two
years ago, during the “boom ” time, floated into
a limited liability company, but finding it
was not less successful under the management
of directors the old firm recently repurchased it,
intend carrying it on under the original style and
title of Caldwell and Company, and now solicit the
patronage of all their old clients.
The original genuine article —Wolfe’s Schnapps.
The wife of a Governor of a British colony
has just started for Europe, escorted, on the first
stages of her journey, by the co-respondent in a
recently-squashed divorce-case. She couldn’t help
it, unfortunately. Pretty nearly every imported
official has been a co-respondent, or ought to have
been one, at some period in his career, and some
of them have been two or three co-respondents,
and had a half-share in an elopement. The same
remark applies to the locally-grown official, and to
a good many other people as well. These obser-
vations are not intended as a severe reflection on
anybody.
If in need of a stimulant take Wolfe’s Schnapps,
The literary wags of Great Britain still
write funny little things about the sea serpent.
Until one of these well-authenticated marine eels
gets out of his natural waters, and comes waggling
along the Thames as far as London Bridge, the
cockney humorist will have his annual joke. It is
enough for him that neither he nor any member of
his family ever saw a sea-serpent, therefore they
don’t exist. But for his having applied spermaceti
to his cut finger the cheap London cynic wouldn't
believe in the whale —a ten times more remarkable
monster than any sea-snake that has yet come
within view of people who were not suffering from
jim-jams at the time.

AYER’S PILLS are unsurpassed as a
remedy for constipation, biliousness, sick-head-
aclic, dyspepsia, jaundice, and the common
derangements of stomach, liver, and howels.
They break up colds, mitigate fevers, relieve
gout, rheumatism, and neuralgia, cleanse the
system of malarial poison, and assist in the
formation of' pure, rich blood. These well-
known pills are compounded of the essential
virtues of the best vegetable cathartics, and
contain neither calomel nor any other deleteri-
ous drug. They may, therefore, be adminis-
tered in all cases where a purgative is needed,
without fear of ill effects. Being sugar-coated,
they are pleasant to take, and their medicinal
strength is preserved for an indefinite period
and in any climate. They should be in every
domestic medicine chest and traveller’s satchel.

The following important fact cannot be too frequently
impressed upon the minds of suffering humanity, that
air. Gould, E.8.P., of Bradford, has for sorm time past
and is now giving the Hon prescription fo- Bitters to
all applicants who send a Post Office Order for Sixpence
tor po-tage. Anyone in possession of this valuable pre
sonption can for lOd, make a quart of this marvelous
medicine, and for Is, Bd. can make two quarts, suffi-
cient to terve for two weeks. It may be interesting to
learn that with this prescription all kinds of hopele s
cases have been treated with success when all other
remedies had absolutely failed. People who have been
partly paralysed have been relieved or cured with this
prescription, others have had their reason restored-
people who could not sleep have t ad their sleep re-
stored, others who could not eat have had their a; petite
restored; people who had suffered for years with in-
digestion and its consequences hare had their digestive
powers restored; people who have suffered martyrdom
wth a disordered liver, nervous debility, Ac., have
been cured; peopl t subject to an accumulation of
wind and water have found it disappear under its
influence. A gentleman at Lincoln subieot to fits
fortnightly has not had a fit from the first moment
he began taking it. People troubled for years with
constipation have had their bowels become regular under
its influinee. It is a choice, rare, remarkable remedy
The prescription is simple, it is cheap, it is good. Those
who haven’t sent for it should. It will be found safe
sure, and reliable i i a most all a Intents incident to the
human frame. It is a tonic, alterative, and an aperient
combined of marvellous curative properties. Thes<>
important facts may seem incredible, but it has done
far more than is here claimed for it, proof of which is
sent with each Proscription, and it is given absolutely
free of charge to all applio nts who send a Post < fflep
Order for Sixpence for postage of the same, Colonial
stamps or coins are useless. A mode of self-treatment
at home has been a long-felt want by all well-regulated
minds, and will be found exceedingly advantageous
to sensible persons who desire to know what they
are swallowing. Address —Mr. GOULD, E.8.P., 479

rjlO THEIR CREDIT BE IT SAID.
That Australians generally are not slow to
recognise a genuinely good article—whatever form
it may take —is a fairly well established fact. Nor
does it redound less to their credit that whenever
special merit is perceived by them they are not
slower in freely acknowledging it. and giving it
such support as may lay in their power. The
Waterbury Watch Company receives from day to
day dozens of testimonials from wearers of their
watches in all parts of the colonies—a fact very
gratifying to their endeavours to place reliable
timekeepers at a price within the reach of all.
The following are samples recently received :
Mr. Thomas G. M'Guire writes from Nyngan,
N.S.W. ; “I am well pleased with the Water-
bury as a good, cheap watch, costing very little
for repair. If I had taken as much care of the
Waterbury as I have taken Over other v atches, it
would not have had to be repaired so soon. How-
ever, it has acted admirably under the circum-
stances, and pleased me very much.”
Chas. .1. N. Horstey, Esq., J.P., C.P.S.,
Mudgee, N.S.W., writes under date: “I have
much pleasure in stating that my Waterbury
watch is, without excep ion, one of the best
watches I have ever owned, although I have had
many more expensive. It is a reliable and
excellent timekeeper.”
CAUTION. Intending purchasers of the
genuine article should note that all watches manu-
factured by the Wn“wbury Watch Co. have the
word “WATERBURY ” printed in fine type on
the dial-face, and also the interlaced letters
“ W. W.C0.,” without which none are genuine.

The Melbourne Stakes this year is likely to
prove a public trial for the Cup, as it lias proved on so many
previous occasions, and the prophet who, after selecting six
horses per week for six weeks, can chip in one last grand
absolute final tip on the day before the race should cer-
tainly contrive to fall across the winner or something
“awful near it.” At time of writing, however, “the
great coining event ” casts very little shadow before. The
man who essays to write wise things must evolve them
from his inner consciousness and other sources that are
far less reliable than well-run weigh t-for-age races like the
Stakes and Derby. Even the betting-market gives no
hint as to what may be expected from certain
“divisions,” nor, for the matter of that, have some of the
said divisions fixed up private matters to their satisfac-
tion as this sermon is compiled. Looking at matteis
from a precedent point of view, The Bulletin would
recommend the placed horses in the Melbourne Stakes as
good place investments for the £lO,OOO handicap, always
presuming that the “cracks” are brought out for and
appear to do their best in the weigh t-for-age race on
Saturday.
« * #
. Meantime, seeing that every second man in this
Hemisphere has something to say about the Cup, it is
permissible for The Bulletin to, metaphorically speak-
ing, buttonhole the guileless punter and tell him a tew
things which it “ knows,” silspects, or guesses, without
prejudice to the solid editorial opinion that nobody can
possibly know much until the winning number goes up.
We will, at any rate, avoid the exasperating imbecility of
selecting every horse in turn, in order that we may ulti-
mately stand upon our head to announce that this
journal said Thingummy was sure to happen if 15 others
didn’t beat it. Commencing at the top of the list, then,
let us take Carbine to beat Melos and all the horses
weighted at from Bst. upwards. Melos seems to be
more generally fancied than Mr. Wallace’s great horse,
but no good reasons for the fancy are apparent.
Sixteen times the two horses have met and thirteen times
has Carbine won, giving his old opponent 121bs. over two
miles on two occasions. Carbine had a bad heel when he
ran in last year’s Cup, yet he finished in front of Melos,
who meets him again this year upon exactly similar
terms. Excuses were made for Mr. Gannon’s horse, it is
true, but excuses are weak things to swear by. We prefer
to swear by the facts that Carbine has won his last ten
races clean off the reel, and has beaten Melos the last six
times they have met. What is there to show’ that the one
has improved more than the other since last Cup day?
# * *
People do say that Hickenbotham will run first
and second for the Cup with Tantallon and Prince Consort,
and the stable is credibly reported to be sweet upqn the
former. But neither horse has been directly tried with
Carbine, and w’e have some grounds for stating that the
trainer doubts their ability to beat the champion at the
weights when he, a sluggard at exercise, conies to put his
best leg foremost. Ramage says he never yet crossed a
horse in any way approaching Carbine as a racing-
maonine
* * #
Probably the Cup will go to Ballarat, where so
many good stakes are likely to go this season. Vengeance,
Chaldean, Enuc, and Annesley are the most notable Cup
horses trained in that mysterious district, hut the latter
is not certain to run, even if he doesn’t earn a few' pounds
extra by winning the Derby. Enuc, to our way of think-
ing, is worth backing in preference to Vengeance, and we
will take him to heat all the other three-year-olds in
the race. The horse is bred to stay, and has been
tried to stay the two-mile course* and his third
in the Caulfield Cup will bear criticism. Chaldean
on the other hand, has no recent form, nor any form for
two years past to recommend him, save his apparently
brilliant run in the Caulfield Cup of ’SO, which run was
suddenly interrupted by his breaking a blood vessel. The
horse has been for some time in charge of the Wilson who
trained Sheet Anchor and Bravo, and some who are not
fools say that he is fit, and a “good thing” for the Cup
which his sire, Assyrian, won eight years aim. The bet-
ting-market will point to the better of Chaldean and
Enuc, although they are not in the same ownership
Perhaps the dark horse may show for the Melbourne
a takes, and so enable punters to judge his chance by as
niueh as they can see with their own eyes. Anyway
either Chaldean or Enuc is certain to he a favourite pro-
bably first favourite, on the morning of the big event, and
those who “ follow the money ” will stand a fair chance of
oemg on the absolute winner at last.
* * * #
Oddly enough, the four-year-olds don’t look
particularly dangerous, Muriel and Chintz have fair
onanoes on last year’s form, which is more trustworthy
than the two-year-old form of Marvel, who cannot be
worth backing at anything less than twenty to one. We

The “knowing ones” who estimate horses’
chances for the Melbourne Cup by the quantity of “ long,
strong work ” rubbed into them week after week before
the race, may be interested to hear that Memoir, the
winner of the Doncaster St. Leger, was discarded by turf
prophets on account of her preparation having been
interrupted for several days. It was the interruption
that ultimately pulled the mare through.
» * •
What show have the general public of dropping
upon a winner in a large field when even the trainers of
the stables do not know the qualities of the horses under
their own care ? Take Megaphone, for instance. Hicken-
botham, apparently, did not know' that the colt had
“gone off,” when the dollars were piled on him at Caul-
Held. It would be hard to find a more astute horseman
than William Kelso, but even he, when sending two horses
for a race, does not plank his “ hit” on the right animal.
At Warwick Farm, a couple of weeks ago, Kelso sent
Velocity and Southerly Buster - the latter was backed,
but Velocity won. On Saturday, at Moorefield, he sent
Velocity and Dolphin. The stable pinned their faith and
planted their coin on Velocity, but again they were mis-
taken, and the winner turned up in Dolphin.
* * *
The heavy backing of Titan for the Melbourne
Derby is about the most extraordinary piece of work in
connection with the coming Victorian meeting. Heavily
backed for the Sydney Derby and Caulfield Guineas, he
went under, and to an outsider his three-year-old running
does not show that he has a million to one chance of
winning. On “ gallops ” Gatling should about win, and
no win would be more popular with the crowd than that
of the unlucky owner of first-class and second place
animals, Mr. “ Bill ” Gannon.
* * *
Dear Bulletin, —A paragraph in your “Referee’
column on right-handed racing-tracks recalls to my mind
an incident. When a lad I was present at a Warrnambool
(Vic.) race-meeting. A steeplechase was one of the items.
A friend of mine (some years older tha nyself) and I
were w’atching the steeple being run. M 3 ! end stood to
win a good sum on a local horse, ant' ’ onsequently
w'atched the champion, Lone Hand, vt anxiously.
Suddenlj 7 J exclaimed: “B} 7 Jove, i.J s baulked;
Corrigan will never get him around now.” I looked upon
my friend at that time as a great authority upon all
matters connected with horse-racing, and therefore asked
for an explanation. He said : “Lone Hand would never
go around this course, as it is a right-hand one.” Lone
Hand had baulked at the double just past the entrance,
and so suddenly did he stop that Corrigan went over
first. If I remember right!} 7 , the horse did not finish in
that race. I do not know 7 wdiether my friend’s opinion
about the right-handed course and Lone Hand w 7 as correct
or not. He afterwards proved, poor fellow, to be not
altogether right in his cranial department, for he is now 7
a member of Parliament and is married.—Bex The
Trapper.
* * #
The writer of “ Sporting Notions ” in the
Referee (Lon.) says : —“ I recollect not many years ago a
M.0.C., or Zingari, or Gentlemen of England, or some-
thing of that sort, side against the Australians, and that
on tire last afternoon, when a draw was inevitable, the
Zingari, or M.C.C., or Gentlemen of England amused
themselves by chucking up balls for Bonnor to hit.
This egregious burlesque of cricket was counted as
a factor in the first-class averages, and the cabled details
of the batsman’s performance caused great admiration
and excitement on the other side of the globe.” The
cable liar has always held a brief for Australian cricket.
* # #
The Warwicks had quite a pleasant little outing
on Saturday last, when they met the Carltons on Sydney
Association Ground. Donnan and Bannerman, of the
Carltons, w 7 ent first to the wickets and were not separated
until 281 runs were made, Donnan being run out for 117.
The game now stands one wicket for 296, W'ith Bannerman
not out 131, and Marr not out for 33.
** . *
Larry Foley used to say that he never had a
pupil who could equal Slavin in “ barrack ” and “ skite.”
The latter is certainly putting on a little too much frill
in London.

•Toe Thompson and Alf. Jacobs are ab ut to
establish a racecourse in San Francisco and settle down
there. If they were followed by a thousand or so of the
profession Australia would not suffer. Chapel-bazaars
w r ould fully supply the national taste for gambling.

The Sydney peds. have formed a union. The
peds. in their adversity have nothing to blame except
their own “cronk” transactions. The gaffers and pro-
moters can now obtain better sport from the novices. So
can the public who pay the piper.
* * *
It is amusing to see how a certain sporting
scribe, when_ his selections do not come off—and that is
often—invariably writes next day about the “glorious
uncertainty of the turf.”

A Sydney gentleman (!) is advertising for ladies
to form a cricket club “ similar to that already formed in

Steeplechaser Bushman, over whom there has
been more blaspheming by the general public than was
even heard on the West Sydney hustings, has gone into a
stable which will turn him out a winner if lie has it in
him. He has been purchased by Mr. William Kelso.

The Rev. Walter Fellowes (of Melb.), whom
Bishop Moorhouse induced to give up cricket, is credited
with the biggest hit ever made at Oxford, when, in 1850,
he hit a hall, howled by Rogers, 175 yards from pitch to
fall.

An analysis of the Seventh Australian Eleven
shows the Australians made 10,573 runs as against the
Britishers’ 0,739, the average per wicket being Australia
16’525, England 15'409. Of the colonial batsmen, veteran
“ Billy” Murdoch tops the batting average with 23'38,
and then they run : Barrett, 22-50 ; Trott, 19-57 ; Lyons’
17'54 ; Blackham, 15 7 38 ; Turner, 15-10 ; Ferris, 15-2
Charlton, 14-30 ; Gregory, 12-28 ; Jones, 12-4 ; Burn, 10-5 ;
Walters, 10-2; Tremble, 8"6. Trott and Murdoch each
twice scored over 100 in a single innings. Trott 186
against Cambridge, and 102 against Gloucestershire ; and
Murdoch 158 against Sussex, and 129 versus Cambridge.
Among the howlers Turner took the cake with an average
of 12-45 for 7303 balls, whilst Ferris bowled 8405 for an
average of 13-43. Turner clean bowled 103 wickets to
Ferris’s 59.

The Australian Athletic Club, it is said, intend

No. XVI.-A Bathurst Field Day.
[ FOR THE BULLETIN .]
“By the Lord! Snowlee, did you ever
hear such stuff as this ?” And the speaker, bluff
Tom Coxson, of Coxson’s Bully Barm—a tiny
little freehold of some twenty thousand acres
watered by Campbell’s River —quoted, in sten
torian sing-song—
When shall the sojis of Bathurst Plains,
With many a nymph and many a maid,
The village queens, and Albion’s swains,
Draw up their bands along the elude V
No more the clanging chain shall sound,
And crime shall hide her ’minished head;
Simplicity shall smile around,
And pity weep o’er sorrows tied !
“ Now, can you imagine such arrant nonsense
being allowed to be printed not to say' written—■
by the authorities? Why', it’s enough to lead to
a break-out on every' holding in the colony !”
To emphasise the disgust Mr. Coxson felt at the
charming vision called up by the poetic driveller
of the New South Wales Magazine, he threw
the old copy of the interesting periodical from
which ho had been reading into (he street.
“Faugh! Here, Mrs. Dillon, give me another
rum to wash the taste out of my mouth !”
Mrs. Dillon, of the Red Cow Inn, Bathurst,
predecessor of the Mrs. Blacks and the Charley
Turners who have successively swayed the
destinies of the “chief hotel in the place, sir,”
hurried to obey the order. Had it been any other
than Coxson who had cast her book into the road-
way she would have called Ned the groom to
throw h m out. She was never tired of reading
those same verses which had so irritated her hot-
tempered customer, and she had kept the maga-
zine till it was stale with time and with beer. For
she had a soft heart and an eye given to dropping
sympathetic tears, though she was hostess of the
R d Cow ; and she really looked forward to the
ia. py days when the May-pole and the dancing-
tent should be hoisted on Bathurst Green, in the
place where now the new springing grass grew
reddish, because the soil was dewed weekly with
showers of blood.
But Tom Coxson was a regular visitor to the
Red Cow, and a thirsty visitor and a generous
visitor, and Mrs. Dillon could not afford to offend
him. When (as regularly happened once a month)
he drove into Bathurst 10 or 12 assigned servants
to receive their usual dose of medicine, he put
them all up as well as himself at the principal
hostelry, and fed ’em well and drank ’em well
both before and after they had interviewed the
doctor. In view of which fact Mrs. Dillon did
not call upon her groom’s services. She did not
even remonstrate with the person who had treated
with such despisement the outpourings of the
muse of her (avourite poet, one Henry Ha Horan
(a Grateful Sovereign decorated him, many years
afterwards, with a C.M.G.-ship). But she jotted
down another line or two to Mr. Coxson’s score,
and in that way healed her wounded feelings.
# # #
Thomas Coxsuii and James Snowlee,
Esquires, land-owners and Justices of the Peace,
had come in to the City of the Plains to join with
two other gentlemen, similarly endowed by For-
tune and the Kings Majesty, to adjudicate at the
ordinary Court of Petty Sessions to be holden on
the morning of Monday, ill st August, 183—.
Having breakfasted very comfortably, they were
now sitting un the verandah of the inn waiting
the opening of the Court.
Snowlee, of Derndale, a thin-faced, small-sized,
watery-eyed man, was deep in the previous week’s
i <sne of the Gazette when interrupted by Coxson.
People said he lived on Gazettes. He read
nothing besides the Gazette, except for its rela-
tion to the Gazette. He was a peripatetic index
to that liveliest and most sensational of publica-
tions, and his mental qualities were stamped with
its characteristics. His ordinary conversation
was’ marked with all the graceful elegance of
Impounding Notices, while the eloquence of a
Proclamation, or an announcement of the reward
for an absconder invariably inspired his magis-
terial dicta. Everybody, from the Governor to
tlie newest of his assigned men, laughed at him
for tins weakness. However, he let the “free”
class laugh and he flogged the other when he found
them out. And by means of this amiable weak-
ness he built up one of the greatest fortunes ever
amas cd in Western New' South Wales,
* * *
It would take a volume of the Gazette of
the compass of the present year’s to record the
eases where he made big money out of his know*
ledge of Government advertisements. Did a
traveller pass Derndale station —the road out
West ran by it —Mr. Snowlee, by virtue of his
magistracy, had him stopped, demanded his
“pass,” and had his “ marks ” examined. Woe
betide the man, whether “ free ” or “ bond,” if he
had marks upon him or his horse that were, or
could be made with a little alteration, identical
with marks ascribed in the Gazette to an
absconder or an offender, or to a stolen horse!
Snowlee would arrest the man on suspicion. If
the fellow had no money Snowlee would have him
brought before the next court, would have him
convicted of absconding or theft, sentence him, or
commit him, as the ease might be—and claim the
reward which, never less I lian v 2 for a man, went
sometimes as high as £5O for a horse. If the man
possessed money, Snowlee would lock him up in
an outhouse overnight. Unto the prisoner would
come, at nine or ten o’clock, not Sn wlee but
Snowlee’s confidential man. Asa “kindly act”
Mr. Snowlee’s confidential man would assist the
| prisoner to escape.
If the prisoner was really an absconder or other
man ou whom Justice —no, that s a slip ; we mean
the Authorities- had put a price (and in one year
in sunny New South N\ ales Authority put a price
upon two thousand heads) the chances were that
he would take advantage of the “kindly pro-
posal ” and bolt, leaving his money behind. On
the other hand, if he were not justly accused, he
might resolve to fight it out. And a strong fight
he would have to make of it, in very sooth, if he
wished to save his cash and his freedom. A very
lucrative business did Mr. Snowlee make of his
justiceship and his recollection of Gazette Re-
ward Notices combined; but bis revenue from
this source was a mere billy-full out of the two-
gallon-bucket of his income. .
Was a land-grant deed in the counties ot
Bathurst and Roxburgh announced as ready years
after it ought to have been issued ? Mr. Snowlee
had an assignment of the grantee’s interest
made, perhaps, the very day the Gazette reached
Derndale. . ,
Was there a tender accepted from amanagamsn
whom Mr. Snowlee “ knew something? ’’ A very
handsome percentage went into Mr. Snowlee s
pocket—that is, supposing Mr. Snowlee could non
see his way to work the contract himself at a
larger profit. .

impounding notice to suit a friend, before sale-
day ho generally heard from Mr. Snowlee, and
was glad to get off lightly by a communication
with Mr. Snowlee’s “confidential man,” m which
an order on Prosper de Mestre or George Terry,
or a cheque on the Commercial Bank was pro-
minently referred to.
Did a neighbouring squatter still hold a prisoner
to “assigned labour ” some time after the man’s
“pardon” or “ticket” had been gazetted —and
forgetfulness of this sort was quite a common
thing on the part of certain Western land-owners!
—how eager (according to his own statement) was
Mr. Snowlee to pay ten pounds out of his own
pocket to his own “confidential man” to stop
“further bother,” and with what a deprecating
friendliness of tone he would inform the forgetful
squatter that he had done so—“ You see, B ,
I had to shut his mouth !” and how modestly he
would pouch Mr. B ’s ten pounds, and how
reluctantly he would hand his “ confidential man”
a solitary half-sovereign as his share of the spoil!
Well might people say Mr. James Snowlee,
J.P., lived on the Gazette, and very properly
did Bishop Barker remark, three decades later,
when preaching Mr. Snowlee’s funeral sermon,
that, “while the reading of the dear departed
brotner had not been of a wide or discursive
character, it had been eminently profitable. ”
# # #
It was this GrAZBTTE-nourished gentleman
who had been addressed by Mr. Tom Coxson, and
who borrowed the previous Thursday’s issue to
respond to Mr. Coxson’s remarks.
“I quite agree with you,” he said. “There
should be a law in that case made and provided.
Such a document as you have just quoted is an
incitement to mutiny and to an overt and covert
disrespect on the part of the legally-convicted
prisoners of the Crown towards the constituted
authorities. To express any opinion that any
imaginary state of things can be possibly better
than the present state of things is to implicitly
and explicitly assert that the last mentioned state
of things is not the best possible state of things. ”
“ Do you mean to say, Mr. Snowlee,” broke in
a stalwart grazier who had come into the verandah
While the other was speaking, “ that you consider
the present condition of things here as right and
good ? ”
“Oh, is that you, Suchor? That’s what I do
mean. The authorities would alter anything that’s
Wrong. If anything is not altered, then it’s right
and proper. Don)t you agree with me, Coxson ? ”
“On my soul I clo ! ” said bluff Tom. “ And
that’s why I said all these d fellows who
scribble about a time when the chains shan’t clank
and the whip shan’t flog should be put down—
they create discontent in prisoners’ minds, and
make ’em think that there’s a lot of things that
are wrong.”
Manly George Suchor made no further remark,
but turned away when Coxson spoke. The Squire
of Baulkham Hills had no objection to a contro-
versy with Snowlee but he would not argue with
the other. The Campbell’s River man invariably
lost his temper if opposed in argument, and as he
could not well vent his spleen on his opponent,
he would gratify his anger by more severely
punishing his convict servants. Suchor had a
vivid recollection of having worsted Coxson in a
bar-parlour debate some months before, on which
occasion Sam had taken his assigned servant from
the buggy in which he was sitting preparatory to
driving his master home: had “made a court”
by asking a brother-magistrate to preside with
him; and had given the unfortunate man a
“ dozen.”
“ What’s this for, Mr. Coxson?” the convict had
asked.
“ Insubordination,” Sam had roared, “ I’ll
teach you to laugh at me when Suchor takes me
down.”
“Please sir,” the unoffending wretch had
whimpered, “ I didn’t hear no talk, and I didn’t
laugh.”
“You didn’t hear it and you didn’t laugh,
didn’t you? Well if you had heard it, you’d have
laughed, so, constable, take him away, and tell
the scourge to give him twenty-five sweet, and to
look sharp about it, as I want to start home-
wards.”
Mr. George Suchor recalled this incident, and
also that he had reported it to the Colonial Secre-
tary and been politely snubbed for his pains.
And, remembering these things, he walked away
from Ooxson’s company. He didn’t wish to make
the “dozen,” which some poor devil there was
waiting to receive, into a “canary.”
As he retired, Coxson said: “That’s one of
the fellows who spoil the Gov’ment men. Why,
they’ll cut his throat some day, see if they don’t.
There’s only one way to keep ’em in hand—give
’em a dose of medicine regular, eh, Snowlee ?”
And he shook himself in a snappish digust.
* # *
The ticket-of-leave man who served his
Majesty King William IY. as Bathurst Court-
keeper, here crossed the road and signified that the
local Temple of Justice was waiting the presence
of the two magistrates to open its doors —and the
shoulders of its brace of scourgers.
Let us enter with Messrs. Coxson and Snowlee.
We will not, however, pass with them to the
Bench where two other justices—mere nonentities
in the roster of brutality, and requiring, there-
fore, no other label than the names of Smith and
Jones—are already 'seated. No; we will take a
seat by Mr. George Suchor in the body of the
court, and watch the proceedings. But we shall
not note all the oases. Our readers’ appetite for
horrors is not insatiable.
* « •
Mr. Justice Coxson began business, and
without getting down from the bench he said :
“ I have nine of my fellows in, gentlemen, to-day,
for insubordination and laziness, and one for
larceny. If you don’t mind, we’ll take the nine
first, so they can get their medicine and be ready
by the time I want to start. I think we’ll have
to give the other fellow three months, so we’ll
take his case last.”
“As you please, Mr. Coxson,” assented Mr.
Snowlee.
“ Certainly, Mr. Coxson,” said Messrs. Smith
and Jones, in chorus.
And the nine were called. One of them, a
lowering-visaged scoundrel, took off his jacket as
he was hustled behind the bars.
Mr. Coxson descended from the tribunal of
Justice and entered the witness-box. He did not
wait for the oath to be administered by the Court,
but mumbled the form himself.
“I suppose I needn’t go into all particulars,
your worships,” he said. “It’s the same old
trouble. When they’re not insubordinate they
are lazy, and when they’re not lazy they are
rebellious and disobedient.”
“Oh, you needn’t trouble, Mr. Coxson,” said
Mr. Snowlee. “ What punishment will meet the
offences ? The statutory maximum, or shall we
be lenient, as is admissible, you know, by regula-
tion providing for the contingency of the master
not pressing for severe punishment ?”
“I’ll leave it to you, gentlemen,” magnanimously
rejoined Mr. Coxson.
“Have you anything to say, prisoners?” was
the bench’s inquiry.
“Wot’s th’ use o’ sayin’ anythink?” said the
ruffian with his jacket off. “We know as th’
master thinks it’s time for our monthly dose o’
med’sun, an’ we’ve got to swaller it any’ow, so
th’ sooner we get it down th’ better, and th’ longer
it’ll be till th’ nex’ dose.’’
“ You’ll oblige me by giving this man a hundred
for his insolence now, your worships,” said the
prosecutor, “in addition to the punishment for
his insubordination. I will prefer the charge of
larceny against him later.”
“Oh, certainly, Mr. Coxson,” replied Mr.
Snowlee, who registered the decision —two hun-
dred lashes in all.
(Mr. Suchor, in the body of the court, pulled out
a pocket book and noted therein “200.”)
“All right, yer Washups,” said the offender.
“ I knew I was in for it, an’ thet’s w’y I tuk my
coat orf afore I kem in. ”
“Please the Bench,” said prosecutor Coxson,
“I have to apologise for this man’s disrespect to
the court in appearing without his jacket. I
didn’t notice it before. Suppose you give, him
another “dozen” to teach him not to show con-
tempt to the King’s Justice?”
“Oh, certainly, Mr. Coxson,” replied Mr.
Snowlee. (And Mr. Suchor noted another “25.”)
Without a dissentient expression from the eight,
each was sentenced to a “ dozen.” (Mr. Suchor
noted “8 x 25 - 200.”)
The Court had been sitting ten minutes when
Mr. Coxson, having done the great part of his
share of the day’s work of prosecution, replaced
Mr. Snowlee on the bench, and Mr. Snowlee took
Mr, Coxson’s place
# * #
Mr. Subwleeprosecuted four of his assigned
men for laziness and refusing work. The quar-
tette were typical convicts. The square jowl,
that had grown deformed by the grinding of teeth
during the infliction of the lash, was an attribute
of each. Not one but had a terrible record —
according to the System’s notions; the least-
scourged of the lot had over 1000 lashes to his
debit.
“What will meet the case, Mr. Snowlee?”
asked Mr. Coxson.
“ By line 5, clause 15, section 9 of ‘ the Regula-
tions for Convict Discipline,’ chapter —,” began
the lord of Derndale.
“Oh, we’ll not trouble you about that, Mr.
Snowlee,” interrupted Coxson, with some im-
patience. “We know the maximum, but what’s
the least number that will properly punish these
fellows ? We want to be merciful, if we can.”
“ Certainly, your Worships,” said Mr. Snowlee.
“ And, under the circumstances, I think fifty
a-piece will do.”
And fifty a-piece it was, (And in the pocket-
book went down : “4 x 50 = 200.”)
Mr. Snowlee resumed his place on the bench,
and Mr. Smith got down, went into the witness-
box, prosecuted five of his men, and let ’em off
with five “dozen” between them. (Note-book
entry: “125.”)
Mr. Smith went up on the bench again—and
Mr. Jones filled the function of prosecutor for
three minutes, during which time he was successful
in inducing his magisterial brethren to distribute
amongst three men 150 cuts—one hundred to one,
a “ dozen ” a-piece to two. (Mr. Suchor noted:
“100 + 25) = 150.”)
And the defendants —the prisoners, what of
them? They had taken it all as a matter of
course. Two had plucked their forelocks as they
received their sentences, wi ih a cringing sub-
missiveness that would not h ve discredited a race
of hereditary serfs ; several had looked carelessly
about the Court-room while their offences were
under adjudication (if the proceedings of the
magistrates could be so termed) as though they
were the least interested parties present; but
none had demurred. As the jacketless rogue had
said : What was the use of demur or objection ?
The sooner the farce of the trial was over, the
sooner the real business of the day would be over
too, and the longer would be the interval between
their recovery and the next dose.
# * *
After Mr. Jones half-a-dozen other holders
of assigned labour submitted servants
to the tribunal. Six employers offered 25 servants
(including two women) before the shrine of
Immaculate Justice. Of the women, one was sent
to Parramatta Factory : “ She ’adn’t seen Mother
Gaden for a ’ol’ year, an’ w’u’d th’ beaks ’av th’
goodness to send her there ?” and the other was
ordered a week’s “cells,” As to the men, they
were awarded 700 among them. (The entry in
Mr. Suchor’s note-book stands ; “1 @ 100=100 +
(2+50) + (20+ 25)=700.”)
At half-past eleven o’clock (the court had opened
at ten) the magistrates adjourned for a quarter of
an hour —and a glass of wine.
While in the magistrates’ room a discussion
arose respecting the number of lashes.
“Counting the hundred to my man for con-
tempt of court, I make it only 1500,” said Coxson.
Snowlee was sure the total of stripes ordered
was 1600. In a pet, Coxson sent for the Clerk of
the Court and told him to bring the charge-book.
“I’ll wager you a pound, Snowlee, that I’m
right!”
“Wagering money is against the law and my
principles,” said Snowlee, “ but I’ll bet my coach-
man against your man, Jack the Shearer.”
Cunning Mr. Snowlee ! His Gazette memory
reminded him that his coachman had but three
months to serve to earn his ticket, and as the
fellow would not be trapped into committing an
offence, Mr. Snowlee would, in any contingency,
lose the man’s services at the end of the time.
Jack the Shearer, however, was a noted hand
with the shears and at all farm work, and Snowlee
coveted him, especially as four years would have
to pass before he could claim a ticket.
Particularly cunning Mr. Snowlee ! For had
he not added together the appointed lashes before
leaving the Court ? He was a man of principle,
but he had no objection to betting upon a cer-
tainty, and, of course, when Cox-son agreed to the
terms of the wager, a reference to the charge-book
showed that the former won the bet.
“ Well, I’ve lost,” said Coxson, closing the book
with a bang, “but, anyhow, sixteen hundred ain’t
so bad, is it ?”
* * #
When the Court re-opened at ten minutes
to noon, bluff Tom Coxson stationed himself once
more on the witness-stand. In the dock, holding
itself together with a courage that, if it had not
been manifested by a convict, would be styled
heroic; grasping the spear-points with swollen
and gory fingers ; in the distortion of its features
and in the compression of lips (a compression
which, while it stifled the cry of pain, sent the
sanguinary sweat oozing the more copiously
through the livid skin), losing its semblance of
humanity ; behind the bars, flogged and gashed,
stood a Creature —a Number —a Symbol of the
System.
It was the convict who had, as the first achieve-
ment of the morning, been awarded 225 lashes,
ftnd against whom his master was about to prefer
a charge of larceny. His name we know, and Ins
register-number; but of his earlier and later
history we know nothing. We have had no heart
to make the search. Had we enquired, we should
probably have found that his criminal history
began with the theft of a faggot valued at one-
shilling, or a bunch of turnips of the price of two-
pence ; and that his life ended on the gallows. A
score —two score —of such lives we have traced
from the starting point of their first committal in
the justice-room of a manorial mansion to the
final scene in some gaol quadrangle—where the
life went out as the warder’s bullet went in or on
the scaffold ; traced them through Assize Reports,
Hulks’ Registers, Convict - ships’ Manifestoes,
House of Correction Abstracts, Gaol Lists, Muster
Rolls and Schedules of Deaths ; traced them from
a happy rusticity to nameless fates, from innocence
to unutterable guilt; from Kentish hamlets or
Midland cities to that Norfolk Island graveyard
where the tear-dropping manchineel weeps silently
on three sides, and the sea moans on the fourth.
But this man’s “ record ” we have not traced. We
were afraid to investigate; for upon the margin ol
the charge-sheet, on whose entries we found con-
firmation of the essential statement of this narra
tive, there is inscribed this note :
This man always maintained that his tirst conviction in
England was wrongful. And from what has been reported
since he left the Bathurst district, there is reason to
believe his story was true.
We did not search out the man’s history, because
we feared to find it true. We did not desire to
add another case of wrongful conviction to our
list of innocent convicts. It was too long already.

Coxson was proceeding to state the facts of
the charge when Snowlee was roused to indignant
remonstrance.
“ Sergeant, how dare you allow the prisoner to
present himself before the Court so indecently
attired ?”
All eyes were fixed on the convict. When he had
got his flogging he had flung his shirt loosely over
his back and had tied it round his neck by the
arms. Over it, he had thrown his jacket. '
“Why isn’t the man properly dressed?”
demanded the Court.
“Well, your Worships,” replied the Sergeant
of Police, “ I didn’t think your Worships would
mind, as the prisoner has to be flogged again to-
day. If he had put his shirt on while his back is
as it is, the cotton would have knitted into the
cuts ”
“Well, what if it did?” snarled Coxson, who,
bear in mind, was not at this moment on the
Bench, but in the witness-box.
“ In that case, Mr. Coxson and your Worships,
the shirt would have brought the skin off with it!”
“ Your excuse can’t be allowed, Sergeant, ’ said
Mr. Snowlee. “The Regulations distinctly
stipulate that every prisoner of the Crown called
to appear before a Court of Petty or Superior
Jurisdiction must present himself in decent
attire.”
“ The man ought not to be before the Court,
your Worships; he is physically unfit,” continued
the Sergeant.
“ You are exceeding your duty, Sergeant,”
interrupted Mr. Snowlee. “The circumstance
that the man is before the Court is sufficient proof
of his capacity to attend the Court.”
“ That was the very observation I was about to
make, Mr. Snowlee,’ said Coxson. “Does the
prisoner produce a medical certificate that he is
unable to attend ? ”
Everybody smiled. Even the prisoner and the
Sergeant smiled ; even the muscles of the magis-
terial faces relaxed ! The idea of an assigned
man producing a medical certificate ! —how rich !
“Oh, never min’ —yer Washups,” gasped the
accused. “Let’s get alon’ with th’ biz-ness. I
dunno wot —I’m to be charged with—but I’m
guilty, I s’pose. We pris’ners are gen’ral’y guilty
w’en th’bosses charge us.”
And they “got along” with the charge. Mr.
Coxson accused him of stealing a loaf of bread
“ He’d kep’—me out o’ rashuns —fur two days,
yer Washups,” interjected the prisoner.
“Yes I did,” deposed Coxson, “but it was a
punishment. And he’d no right to overrule my
will and obtain food when I stopped his rations,
had he, gentlemen ? ”
Of course, he hadn’t. The prisoner was sen-
tenced to do three months in the Blackheath road-
gang, and do 25 lashes for “appearing in Court in
a grossly-indecent condition.” (Mr. Suchor wrote
down another “25.”)
“You’ll postpone the flogging your worships. ”
said the Sergeant.
“Let’s ’av it all —atwunst, Mr. Snowlee, sir,”
the culprit appealed. “’Not her dozen now won’
’urt much !’*
The Bench consenting to the prisoner’s request,
(“ Mr. Snowlee is a just and humane magistrate”
said Judge Burton in a foot-note to a printed copy
of a Charge) the Gov’rnent man was once more
shuffling off to the Flogger’s Corner when Mr.
Coxson stopped him. “Look here,” said his
master, “I’ll want you back when the three
months are up, you know—things will be getting
busy then what with the wool and harvest. Now,
don’t go and get into any more trouble in the
iron-gang and put in more time, d’ye hear ?”
“I tho’t I wasn’t wrong, sir,” the convict made
reply. “ I tho’t yer only put me ’way w’ile things
was a bit slack.”
One of the ingenious practices formed by the
System was the transfer to Government by in-
fluential employers of assigned labour of the cost
of maintenance of some of their hands during the
slack season. All that such a master had to do
was to obtain for the servant a sentence of three
months’ imprisonment for gang-labour. And very
few things were easier done than that, as the
reader will by this time understand.
* * #
After luncheon Mr. Snowlee appeared as
prosecutor for the second time, and bluff Tom
Coxson once more, figuratively speaking, assumed
the toga of the magistrate.
Thomas Dilby was charged by Mr. Snowlee with
being an absconder from Appin-road gang.
Thomas Dilby denied he was Thomas Dilby, said
that he was “ free, ” and that his name was William
Dickson ; had never been to Appin in his life, and
was on his way to Wellington Valley in search of
employment when he was arrested by Mr. Snowlee
on the road near Derndale homestead. Mr.
Snowlee deposed that he remembered seeing in the
Gazette of two years before a description of
Dilby, by which he at once identified the man
when he met him on the highway. Would their
Worships kindly search the index to the Gazette?
Their Worships, being in a kindly mood, did so,
and found a description of “Thomas Dilby, pef
Phoenix (3); native place, Essex; born, 1789;
height, sft. s|in.; complexion, fair ruddy; hair,
brown; eyes, hazel; small scar on right cheek,
impediment in speech ; tatooed with large figure
4 8 over D’ on breast.” When absconded Thomas
Dilby had in his possession a pass signed by Sir
John Jamieson, Kt,, J.P.
“ The prisoner, your Worships, ” further deposed
Mr. Snowlee, 44 is sft. 6in. high, but he may have
grown a half-inch in two years. No one, except
himself, can say, of course, when he was born, but
he looked as if he had been born in 1789; his
complexion is fair, his eyes hazel, his hair brown,
and he has a scar on his right cheek. He has not
now any impediment in his speech, but you know,
your Worships, that a prisoner sometimes assumes
a personal defect of that sort to mislead the
authorities, and he may have dropped the impedi-
ment when he made his escape. Neither had he,
when I caused him to be stopped, any pass signed
by Sir John. But, you know, gentlemen, the
first thing a convict would do would bo to destroy
his pass. Finally, your Worships, though the

BRUCE SMITH.
prisoner has not a huge figure of eight tatooed on
his breast, he has, as you will observe if you order
his chest to be exposed, an hour-glass tatooed
theieon over the letter D. And nothing, I respect-
fully submit, your Worships, can be easier than
to make the figure of eight into the design of an
hour-glass.”
By the Bench’s order, the man’s jacket and
shirt were torn open. There, sure enough, was
“au hour-glass over D ” tatooed with some skill.
Possibly, the outline might have been originally
an 8— but the odds were at least equal that the
drawing had never represented anything but the
toy of old Time.
Dickson, as the man called himself, Dilby, as
Mr. Snowlee contended he was, protested, and
protested in vain. The Bench decided he was
Dilby, and ordered his return to Appin gang,
there to be tried for escaping.
As he was being removed lie shook his fist in
impotent wrath at his accuser: “You per-
jurer ! You blackmailer ! I’ll murder you
if I get the chance !”
Mr. Snowlee was used to demonstrations of
that sort. He simply desired the Bench to pro-
tect him. And, keenly sensitive of the honour of
a brother magistrate, and of the necessity, in the
interests of the King’s Justice, of conserving the
bodily safety of a magistrate, they ordered this
Dilby, alias Dickson, to be flogged.
For threatening a Justice of the Peace they sen-
tenced him to receive 100 lashes.
For creating a disturbance in Court they sen-
tenced him to receive an additional 50 lashes.
For violating that regulation which required
every convict to answer truly as to his identity
when interrogated by a magistrate or officer of the
Penal Department, a further 50 lashes.
(Mr. Suchor here increased his total by “200.”)
How Dickson, otherwise Dilby, took bis flog-
ging ; how the others had taken theirs; how
nobly the twin scourgers, Messrs. Cracknecke and
Chucke.n, did their duty; how children looked
on and laughed as the greedy “cat” licked up
skin and blood ; and how the humble but indus-
tr ions ant held high carnival on the fragments of
human flesh that lay scattered in Floggers’
Corner, we shall tell you on another occasion.

As Mr. George Suchor was drawing down
William-street in his gig, he was hailed by a
relative.
“ Hello, George, didn’t know you were in town
to-day ?”
“Yes, Will; I heard Pugin (Pugin was the
Bathurst P.M.) was away on leave, so as I knew
Coxson and Snowlee were down on the roster, I
thought I’d just run in and see what they did.”
“ Well—how many?”
“ Only 1825, and sent a “ free ” man to a gang
on suspicion of being an absconder. Of course,
Snowlee was at the bottom there. Ten pounds
was the reward.”
“Ah! they’ve held, then, what Slyde, the
Sydney P.M., calls a ‘Field Day’—when he
gives more than 1500 lashes in one day, he calls it
that. Up to 1500, it’s only an ordinary parade.”
i “As well call it that as anything. But, good-bye
—I must be off.” He flicked his whip at his mare,
and, as she started, shouted : “ By the way, Will,
Snowlee told me to-day that the condition of
things couldn’t be better in this district than they
are. What do you think ?”
“ No more they could—from the Devil’s stand-
point.”

The Australian Employers' Union, in one
of the reports which it cabled to dear old Hing-
land, states that “ public opinion is unanimously
favourable to the ship-owners, who have received
liberal subscriptions.” The whole tribe of Aus-

country paper, and the Christian liar who lies on
behalf of the New Guinea missionary, and the
Jand-boom liar, and the liar who gets up the
building society’s satisfactory balance-sheet the

loose, unassorted, unspecified liars who merely lie
in a general sort of way, are respectfully invited
to try if they can do or say anything to beat the
above.
Two hundred and fifty women employed
by a firm of London confectioners have just gone
on strike for the following reasons. They worked
from 12 to 14 hours daily, and were paid at an
average rate of 7s. a week, or a trifle over a penny
an hour. Any employe arriving late was fined at
the rate of 3d. per minute, which seems a trifle
exorbitant seeing that half an hour lost at this
ra‘e would extinguish a whole week’s wages in
one act. Any employe sitting down on any pre-
tence was fined 3d.—whether there was any addi-
tional charge for getting up is not stated. In
case of accidental breakage the offender was fined
three times the amount of the damage. For
singing or attempting to sing on the premises the
penalty was fid. ; for talking, Gd. ; for “ humming
a tune,” 2d. Through some unhappy oversight no
one seems to have assassinated the boss, although
for such an offence there was no extra charge.
[?]
810 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, October 29,1890
Mv Dear Moorabinda, —
Behind my dimpled palm I would like to whisper you
that all the up-to-date society brides always have
trousseau and layette constructed in the one order -
probably on the same principle that makes a man take
his gingham along when he doesn't want it to rain.
Tlie first bride-elect to introduce this custom in Australia
need scarcely have exhibited so much shrewd foresight,
since she went to England to abide (N.B.— Lady Bertie),
but for those damsels who are settled down a hundred
miles beyond the civilised limit by their own Squatter
Augustus, the notion is a golden one. And it finds
favour inGussie’s eyes, too, since he isn't called upon, as
a rule, to foot the extended total of the embroidery-bill
Apropos to trousseaux, the day has passed—or almost—
when to marry meant to pile, clothing around yourself
as if your purchasing powers ceased with the days of
your celibacy. The modern bride now limits herself to
three or four frocks, and puts a gable, so to speak, on
her usual supply of under-linen, thus giving her husband
at least one hook in the doar whereon to hang his little
outbreak of finery. When the silly custom prevailed of
getting a dray-load of dresses and a mile of hats simply
because 3 r ou were about to halve your wardrobe or your
shoe-trunk with somebody e’sf>, the happy man had a
camping-out time of it. And as a man who has specu-
lated in silk socks and dress shirts to adorn the
marriage tie, and who knows how the last chapter of the
bill looked, yearns just as much for a deep, long, empty
drawer to put his trousseau away in as does his bride, it's
just about time the lady left him at least a hat-box all to
himself.
A corset-maker—a being who devoted her gigantic
intellect to getting 30 into 19-collapsed dismally in
Melbourne the other day, and her hopeless failure leads
one to wonder how it is that women who wouldn't wear a
ready-made boot to save their souls buy slop-stays
every time they want to brace up. It is nearly impossible
to get such things to fit; they are lumpy at the top, even
if slick enough at the middle, and who ever knew one that
really fitted round the hips ? Yet the average female goes
on blindly purchasing shapeless masses of whalebone,
whicH wear out much faster than corsets made to suit the
figure, quite content if they pinch her diaphragm horribly,
which means that they are “just her shape,” of course.
So long as she is squeezed to gasping-point, the local
“fashionable” does not ask for more, and, meanwhile,
the venturesome corsetifcre files her schedule, and beauty’s
misfit busks continue to be a prominent feature in her
skirtal outline.
The latest development of the itinerant “ society ”
actress—that of furling her skirts into Turkish trousers
when she sinks peacefully into a seat —makes your Sappho
reflect how very few people there are who manage their
skirts beyond criticism. Most individuals sit with the
lap of their frock sagging downwards inelegantly, others
have it drawn tightly across their knees while they
scrunch and sit on the rest of the drapery, a few haul
the skirt taut round one leg with a surplus of stuff
hunched up on the other side, and now on the stage we
have petticoats tightly wrapped round the two supports
as if to accentuate the fact that the wearer is a biped. Let
us hope the eccentricity will stay behind the footlights,
even though it is especially adapted to reveal the low-cut
shoe and open-work hosen.
N.S.VV. Women’s College fund now stands at £1586 13s.
3d. and as the canvassers are still running strong and well
there is every probability of their scheme coining off.
Miss Helen Phillips, of the Clergy Daughters School, has
been appointed tutoress to the girl-graduates from March,
1891, by which date the Women’s College supporters will
have to show “ Guv’ment ” the big cheque wisely insisted
upon or see the bubble hurst.
The indefatigable members of the committee have de-
cided—in response to an enquiry—that cookery and
domestic economy shall he included in the lofty curriculum
of theN.S.W. Women's College “if money is provided
for the same,” and if the college authorities consent. And
as even Dons know the universal importance of a grilled
chop it isn’t probable they will place many obstacles in
the way of the cookery lectures, oven though the subtle
aroma of boiled cabbage should pervade the great hall
itself. Cookery is a noble study, and I hope they won't
make it an “extra” at the ’Varsity; how much more
interesting the she-grad. will he when you know that she
combines science and buttered scones, and is not at a
loss when confronted by a doubly-dyed proposition or a
joint of raw pork.
Gov. Carington will hold a final “ morning dress” levee
at Government House on Ist November, at 11.30, when lie
will he supported by Lady C., who certainly deserves to
figure officially to the very last gasp. At a quarter after
three their then ex-vice-regalities leave Government
House for the last time for the railway-station, thence by
special train for Moss Vale, where they will spend Sunday,
going to Melbourne on Monday morning. Lord Carington
has privately expressed his intention of paying Sydney a
private visit at some future time, but it is positive that
local society has gaped its long last at his pretty, amiable
wife, after whom your Sappho metaphorically waves a
large, damp, farewell handkerchief.
More in sorrow than in anger yours truly has packed up
her best frock preparatory to flitting southwards per ex-
press in order to he present at the Melbourne Cup. There
will he a shocking dearth of the vice-regal lady at
Flcmington this year. Lady Carington may give the
gubernatorial smile, another stretch in front of the grand-
stand, but as she will only arrive in Melbourne on the
historic 4th, she may be tqo tired to attend. The dames
of the Cabbage Plot will thus be troubled with no
misgivings as to whsttiovingment 'Ouse will have on, nor
will they lie curdled in the midst of their riches by the
dread sight of the leading lady coming out in literal rags
as happened last year. Absence of Governor's wife means
peace of mind to the representative female who for 25
years running has appeared on the lawn each Cup Day
w ith £l5O on her back.
The opening of the big Rose-show happened in Sydney
Exhibition Building (the Society yearned in vain for the
jealously-guarded Centennial Hall), on 22nd inst., in the
presence of Lady Carington. The champion table (a
harmony in pale-pink roses and ferns) showed the same
old trick of more decoration than dinner - there hardly
being room for a knife and fork, and I do think it odd
that these decorations don’t give way awhile to the old,
tired “specimen” glass. An unnoticed table seemed
almost too original in its style. Placed at intervals were
gnarled roots of a fair size artistically filled with crimson
roses, ferns and grasses. It was a very fresh notion, but
as there was rather too much root to the square foot the
effect was cumbersome.
The crowd was rather an advance on former occasions.
Lady Carington, who looked very tired, wore copper-blue
silk designed in gold, sleeves and bodice-front of pale-blue
mull hound in gold straw, white lace and forget-me-nots ;
she also carried a presented bouquet, which looked like a
free fight in a spectroscope, there were so many colours
in it. Mrs. Burdekin (a judge) wore grey woollen with
pale-grey silk border, cuffs and skirt-panel of shag-brown-
strioed velvet; toque in shades of crimson roses and
leaves. Mrs. Haviland Reynolds (wife of the secretary)
were a charming Springish attire in cream delaine flowered
in heliotrope ; collar, sleeves and frontal scarf of heliotrope
silk, dainty bonnet of heliotrope, lisse and myrtle.
A stuffy-lookiiig novelty, which I vainly hoped would
he severely left to flutter fitfully from the “line” above
the draper’s counter, is the Raleigh ruff of cream lisse, to
he worn tightly round the neck of scraggy beauty. It is
a hot-looking addition, and transforms the most charming
creature into a sort of dog Toby on his hind paws ; it also
suggests the mumps. Nevertheless, a Sydney lady wore
one to the Rose-show, and the effect was strictly accord-
ing to schedule.
Lady Carington’s farewell reception at Government
House, Sydney, on 25th inst., was a crowded, hired-
carriage sort of ceremony, made notable by a large
attendance of men. “ Thousands of people ” were there,
and the Departing stood bravely on the verandah and
received the motley crowd, which arrived so thick and
fast that tlie ceaseless handshaking looked like as if Lady
C. was hauling a rope. Brother Rupert, got up to cocked-
hat-and-swotd-point, announced the guests to Her Ex.,
who wore a plain white silk dress, flounced round the
front and laced up the bodice, and trimmed with bands of
gold and silver galon. Mrs. Burdekin sported an artistic
gown in fawn-pink pongee designed in moss-green, the
sleeves and part of the bodice of guipure en suite, knots
of moss-green velvet here and there, and bonnet in black
jet, tulle and pink aigrettes ; Mrs. Vanderveer Green,
sage-green silk with panel and picture-sleeves of
dark-green Russell cord, toque of Russian violets ;
Mrs. Fairfax Ross, fawn and green checks with
bronze-green silk sleeves, toque of lilies of the valley ;
Miss Snowden Smith (the Primate’s chaperone) in black
silk and lace and jet bonnet trimmed with a Bacchanalian
t rimming of grapes ; the Misses Smith, in simple black
and without a word to say for tin mselves; Miss Dight
(who is to marry Captain Barlow), in pale-grey, tailor-
built toque of honeysuckle and black velvet; Mrs.
George Brock wore a unique frock in sunbeam-ye How
poplin slashed in guipure; Lady Innos, shot-pinkish
silk ; Mrs. B. R. Wise, white silk, white chip hat, and
feathers, knot of saffron roses on the bodice ; Miss Frances
Savile, pink pongee figured with green with pink sleeves
and sash, toque of pink and creamy feathers ; and so on
for three volumes. There was a band playing in the
garden, and tea, champagne, ices, &c.—a long, copious,
&c.—were served in the amber drawing and dining-rooms
whither the surges ever rolled to fortify themselves with
unlimited cake against the pain of parting. The Aus-
tralian-born Miss Myee Carington held her farewell levee
in the vestibule as the guests passed out, but even the
most representative gushers were not allowed to kiss the
interesting vice-regal addition, who concluded her recep-
tion with a dismal howl.
On dit that Lady Carington was observed to shed a
damp tear at the farewell reception. And no wonder.
If shaking hands with an army, each member of which
gripped you like a crab, didn’t bring the water to your
eyes you would be suspected of having an automatic arm.
Everything considered, it is a wonder the tears didn’t run
down the vice-regal cheeks all the time.
I am afraid I am hardly sentimental enough properly to
appreciate anybody’s “Romeo and Juliet.” I was not
thrilled when the Potter twined her snaky arms round the
Bellew, and even the balcony-scene could not make me
overlook the fact that Mrs. Potter had made her face up
like a third-row coryphee, and that her erotic smile looked
gummy on her re-appearance at Sydney Royal, on 25th
inst. But the gowns were there, as usual, and after all
the woman who knows how to dress is well worth watch-
ing. There are four frocks and a rohe-de-nuit in white
woollen, worn with white satin boots, which implies that
the hope of the Capnlets was in the habit of turning in
with them on, doesn’t it? It is in the minuet scene that
the prettiest gown occurs. It is of pale lavender-grey
poplin, the skirts edged with gold and silver galon,
the upper part of the long sleeves of silk, the
under part in long wing-like sweeps of grey gauze
spangled in silver ; the short bodice over the full
“chemise” waist of cream-silk was in green and gold
brocade with front of galon. Necklaces of pearls, a pearl-
girdle, and the usual latticed head-dress for ornaments ;
while the bouquet of actinotus (rather an anachronism, by
the way) was held in the same hand as a crushed straw-
berry scarf. As Juliet, Mrs. Potter generally grasps a
long piece of silk which has no visible connection with the
toilette, and one begins to think the passionate young
party has a perennial head-cold. In the Nurse scene,
Mrs. Potter wears primrose brocade, the skirt slit up
and laced over carubia satin ; the upper sleeves of oaruhia
satin, with the underpart of puffs of brocade, tied at inter-
vals with crimson laces, the front of the bodice in oaruhia
satin designed in gold, cap of oaruhia velvet with
two crimson roses, while a yard of yellow “Liberty”

blue shows mistily ; in the last scene ivory satin brocade
slit over an underskirt of silk and trimmed with gold

any amount of bogus interment. As Romeo, Bellew

U. ji- reported of a certain debonnair M.P. that on a
recent occasion lie kept a late train, half-fnfl of ladies,
waiting indefinitely. The “ orders ” were for the train to
hang about until he and his party came along, but the
vociferous objections of the passengers overcame red tape
and after much vigorous telephoning the procession
moved on after an hour’s delay. It afterwards transpired
that the courteous legislator never turned up at all at the
station. Such are Parliamentary manners.
Which reminds us that a gushing Toorakian person—
ever notoriously anxious to be in touch with the “ court
pawty ’’—once had the calmness to ask Lady Loch what
coloured gown she Intended to wear at the Cup? Even
that amiable mistress of diplomacy was unable to endure
the query and tried to snub the presumptous creature by
languidly replying: “ Really, Mrs. Dash, you had better
see my maid.” But the snub didn’t come off. Mrs.' Dash
did see the maid, or somebody, and the vice-regal toilette
w as one of twins on that occasion.
The man who possesses sixteen wifes’ sisters and a
culminating mother-in-law will be interested in the fact
that the English law-courts have decided that the husband
can forbid any lady whom he doesn’t fancy as an occasional
domestic addition, to cross his threshold, and should she
thereafter insist on calling, he can bring an action against
her and make the fair aggressor pay the piper 1
It is decidedly rough on the members of Sydney Phil-
harmonic Society that the “ Messiah ” is to he produced
on Xmas night. People who warble cannot do it effec-
tively on anything heavier than a mutton-chop and dry
toast, and thus the conscientious chorister will have to sit
cheerfully chewing his mutton while the turkey passes up
the other side. If he doesn’t, the choruses will sound as
if they were filtered through wadding. It is definitely
arranged that Madame Patey is to assist the society.
The departure of the little Caringtons (accompanied by
Miss Walenn) for England, per Orizaba, on 27th lust,
attracted a crowd of people-to the (juay. A number of
their little ex-playmates were there to wave farewell, and
Lord and Lady Carington, attended by Captain Helherl,
came to see them off. The vice-regal party have engaged
six cabins—Miss Walenn sharing her’s with Miss Cox, w ho
goes to England to marry Captain Trench. Lady Caring ton s
cabin is exactly 'amidships and has been especially fitted
in pink and primrose brocade, with a bouquet of waratahs
(a wiry decoration warranted to last out the voyage).
Lord Carington’s cabin is unadorned (except fora bouquet
of waratahs) at his special request. The Orizaba lias a
very full passenger-list.

The wedding of Miss Bertha Kerr, second daughter of
the late Robert Kerr, of Western Victoria, with Mr.
“Charlie” Lord, third son of lion. Francis Lord, M.L.C.,
took place on 2nd inst. at All Saints, Woollahra. The
bride adopted the new fashion of wearing the veil thrown
back from her face.
The harbour picnic again rears its hydra-head. On 25th
inst. Mayor Burdtkin ran 130 Town Hall officials down
the harbour ; and on 18th inst. Mr. G. If. Reid gave a
most successful picnic on the sboresof “Our Great Natural
Advantage.” There were a compact number present,
including Mrs. Burdekin, Lady Innes, Hon. Rupert
Carington, and Captain Helherr, and the gay and festive
bachelor host was congratulated all round on the success
of his gipsy party.
A highly successful festivity was the ball given by Mr-
and Mrs. S. A. Fullford, “Norwood,” Hurstville, on 24th
inst. Mrs. Fullford received the guests in the vestibule,
and wore a trained gown of black silk with sleeves of
jetted ret, Elizabethan collar and front of Maltese lace
lace. A special train conveyed a large number of the
guests back to town at 1 a.in.
A quiet, though stylish, wedding was the ceremony
w hich made Miss Carrie Burton (daughter of Mr. Edwartl
Burton, editor of the Sydney Mail! Mrs. Frank Millington
on 23rd inst. The bridal gown was albescent, as usual, and
the three bridesmaids (Miss Mary and Miss Hetty Burton
and Miss Proctor) wore simple frocks of apricot mull and
carried floral baskets. The Congregational Church, Pitt-
street, was most artistically decorated —with actinotus
principally—and as the bridal party left the church their
path was literally strewn with rose-leaves. An informal
reception was held at Ounsler's, and at 8 o’clock the
happy pair left for Katoomba. Mr. Millington is editor
and part proprietor of the Gwydir Examiner, Moree.

Labour in Parliament.
Peak Bulletin, —The moment a social
movement becomes crystalised in a poli-
tical movement its doom is sealed. Creeds
are the shrouds of dead faiths, ceno-
taphs of evaporated inspirations. No sooner
does the democratic agitator enter the
councils of his country than he becomes
the mere catspaw of party, the formless
figure-head of a defunct cause. Everybody
has heard the anecdote of the would-be
traveller from Strasburg to Basle who, when
asking the price of his passage, was informed
by the captain of the boat that it was four
gulden on board and two if he helped to
draw the boat on the tow-path. The labour-
party in Australia is much in the same case.
Outside of the political rings its power is
formidable. Let it once allow its own per-
sonal representatives to enter the charmed
circle of unblushing intrigue and shameless
log-rolling and it immediately degenerates
into a convenient lever for the elevation to
power of a number of filibustering dema-
gogues and blatant caucus-manipulators,
whose sole recommendation to the suffrages
of the workmen are brazen effrontery and
the clever handling of that species of vulgar
buffoonery comprised by the tricks and
and shifts of cheap stump-oratory.
* # #
Labour in Australia has put its foot on the
verge of a new order. The present strike
has evidenced, and now evidences, a soli-
darity, a cohesiveness of interest little sus-
pected by the gymnasts of political life, or
the wire-pullers of party. I he present
strike may prove nothing more to Labour
than a moral victory rather than a substan-
tial success. Sobe .it! From the experience
of to-day the policy of to-morrow may be
drawn. If Labour is defeated now it will
learn a valuable lesson for future use. The
next strike, fought in a different way, will
be a battle to the death. The strikers will
have learnt that consideration and modera-
tion are thrown away in a conflict with an
insensate aggregation of money-bags. So
far, well and good ! But a danger threatens
the interest of Labour which bids fair to
nullify all the lessons which might have been
taught by the The alleged leaders of
the people show evident signs of turning a
purely social agitation, having for irs object
a reconstruction of the conditions which
regulate the distribution of wealth, into a
political trend for the'purpose of advancing
personal and party interests, and frigidising
a tremendous power into a mechanical force
for the regulation of the issues of the ballot-
box. No longer dictators, the Labour
Organisations will be regarded as so many
naughty children whom it is necessary to
placate with sugary promises, and hood-
wink into stupid acquiescence by drawing
side questions across the path of direct issues.
* * *
Labour is lost in Parliament! From
without politicians may be coerced, cajoled,
threatened and forced into representing the
interests of a compact party powerful
enough to drive them into obscurity. From
without Labour, can make the log-roller
sue for its suffrages. From within
Labour rapidly degenerates into a mere
tool for the political advancement of the
ambitious demagogues who may have tasted
the sweets of power and privilege for no
more than a single session. The Labour
vote, like the Orange vote, like the Local
Option vote, like the publicans’ vote, is
powerful enough to force the would-be
tribunes of the peojffe on their knees.
Labours own selected representatives from
Labour s own ranks are, however, invariably
human organisms who trade away their trust
for a permanent situation in proximity to the
Parliamentary refreshment-bar and the clubs
where votes are bartered over recherche
dinners. The chosen representative of
Labour may be an honest enough man when
he first crosses the threshhold of the Legis-
lative Chamber ; give him only time suffi-
cient, however, and he will awaken to his
true position. He is, first of all, a property-
less creature. He is not a specially able
man ; perhaps he lacks even the rudiments
of education. His air and his dress and his
speech, if he is a true blue workman and not
already possessed of undertaker’s livery, are
subjects for the ridicule of the House, butts
upon which the young “aristocratic” mem-
bers and the old Parliamentary hands dis-
charge the arrows of their practised persi-
flage. Smarting, irritated, in time humi-
liated by routine sarcasm, he seeks to make
his peace with the recognised authorities.
The “ situation ”is a comfortable one. He
drinks the choicest liquors, he eats the
choicest viands, he is treated with deference
and respect whenever his vote is wanted.
Gifted with a certain amount of shrewdness,
an ability to rave and bluster on fit occasions,
possessing a species of coarse wit which is
very valuable when he is badgered, and the
exercise of which often scores a point where
knowledge or eloquence would be thrown
away, he hastily discards the insignia of his
order, the outward and visible signs of
the cause he was chosen to advocate.
Ho adopts the silk-hat and the frock-coat
of respectability and vested stakes, he makes
himself acquainted with all the minutice of
parliamentary procedure, he conserves his
vote with adroitness, and speaks only upon
questions which appeal to the ballot-box.
In a brief period his corruption is complete.
He ceases to be a man, to be a workman and
the representative of workmen ; he becomes
an edger, a trimmer, a calculator, a turner
and twister, a cunning speculator whose
future as a politician is more to him than all
the interests of Humanity put together. He
dreads a return to the ranks of those he was
elected to represent and his life degenerates
into a frantic effort to hold on to the skirts
of whatever political faction or squalid
religious denomination he imagines to be
able to ensure his position as a holder of a
snug and comfortable situation.
# # #
The Labour party of Australia should
recognise the true condition of affairs. As a
party outside of political life it can compel
politicians to legislate for the cause of Labour,
It is in the magnificent position of a belli-
gerent dictating terms, and it has the power
to deal summarily with whomsoever betrays
its trust. Inside the House it can do noth-
ing ! It would in the hands of its own
representatives, chosen from ifs oWn ranks,
be degraded into an instrument for advertis-
ing to the country the names of men who
are ambitious to feather only their own nests
and to assure only their own ad»ancement.
A while since the most apparently advanced
of their tribunes in the New South Wales
Parliament a man whose name was synony-
mous with the core and inner heart of
socialistic democracy, could raise his voice
hardly high enough for the People who put
him into power. To-day he denounces as
“ fools and fanatics” whomsoever beneath
the sun should attempt the “ reconstruction”
of that Society whose need of reconstruction
gave him an opportunity of opening his
mouth upon the subject. The cause of
Labour is the cause of the People as a
whole, it is the cause of all, and that is a
narroAV view of the question which would
confine its interest to any organization or
any number of organizations which selected
the most cunning or the most successful
stump-orator to represent the interests of
Labour on a political board of directors con-
stituted apparently for the most successful
mode of dissipating the nation’s energy.
* * *
Politicians walk across the floor of the
House with every change of the political
Aveather-cock. Free-traders and Protec-
tionists, Customs-tariffers and Land-taxers
are apparently convertible terms—all sound
and fury, signifying nothing. With every
approaching election there is a change of
front. The boards of the Legislative As-
sembly Chamber are worn into runnels Avith
the tergiversation of those who have been
elected to tread them. Nothing is sure in
Parliamentary life but change; nothing is
certain but mutability. And is the Labour
Party foolish enough to imagine that the
Labour candidate would be truer to the
principles upon the power of which he
drifted into a legislative life than the ad-
venturer who forswears Protection because
he miscalculated the period of its advent?
No ! a thousand times rather would the
Labour candidate be the more susceptible,
inasmuch as he would the readier become
ashamed of the class and the principles he
represented, for no man is so anxious to hide
his opinions as the erstwhile workman, who
has learnt to wear a frock-coat, and to hide
also the callosities which he imagines to dis-
%ure his hands.
Amongst the representatives of wealth and
caste the workman has no place, unless he
be a very prodigy of mental force and iron
will, uniting all the strength and all the
virtues of all the men who have made history
for men, and such cast-iron heroes are
generally greater in themselves and possess
a greater power for good outside Parliament
than in it, John Burns, for instance,
while all-powerful outside, will probably
be a failure, will waste his time, in Par-
liament. Let the Labour Organisations
recall the experience of the past! Have
they one single man who was sent to Parlia-
meat upon their exclusive suffrages who now
remains true to their cause ? Notone! The
history of any single individual has been the
history of the whole number. To-day a few
smart adventurers in each of the colonies are
tempting the strikers to add another page to
the long history of their bitter experience,
and Ave ask them to remember and resist !
If they are true to this single principle they
will remain in a position which is practically
unassailable. If they are not, they will
simply repeat the silly practice of manufac-
timing puny copies of Bradlatjgh for the
Tory cause,
* *
The Sydney Morning Herald lately an-
nounced that it was, in its opinion, a very
desirable thing that the strike should be
settled before the elections came along,
otherwise the grand old cause of Freetrade
might be lost sight of and confused with a
Labour issue. The workmen now know
what to expect, they also know what course
to pursue. By all the means in their power
they must keep parliamentary candidates to
the close question of Labour issues, for if
legislation is not to deal with the only one
thing which demands legislation, i.e., the
prosperity of the commonwealth, we enquire
the use and reason of legislation at all. If
it is simply a description of trade protection
manipulated by a close ring of capitalists
and corner-operators, the sooner Labour
awakens to the fact the better, and every

man who has the cause of political purity at
heart should be extremely grateful to the
S.M. Herald for its timely information.
However, the working-men of Australia
have another lesson than this to learn from
the Herald’s utterance, and it is this :
“Keep out of politics yourselves, and com-
pel politicians to face you at the hustings on
a distinct Labour issue.” This, workmen of
Australia, is the only means by which you
can conserve all that you have already
gained, it is also the only means by which
you can gain anything in the future. The
House must not be allowed to diverge on
side issues ! Let the tariff alone for the
present, and give the denominational and
educational squabbles a severe rest! Select
your mouthpieces and keep them to the
point, but in the name of Progress hand not
over to your ambitious leaders —whose suc-
cess as organisers and administrators is no
guarantee of their fitness and stability as
parliamentary representatives of the demo-
cracy —a cause which is vital to your in-
terests, and which, moreover, they have
never served with fidelity in the past 1
# # *
Australian working-men are in political
matters usually no more suspicious than
children, perfectly prepared to believe
the promises of any demagogue who
possesses a specious flow of language and
a colossal amount of cheek. Of this
man, Labour Unionists, you must beware !
Do not permit him to use you as a stepping-
stone to a position in which you have always
hitherto been disgustingly “left.” Clothe
no trickster with the toga of your
authority. Use your power to the utmost;
keep your finger upon the political pulse as
persistently as you can, but enter not into
the political arena in the persons of your
own representatives. You have nothing to
expect from the man who is anxious to leave
your ranks, and everything to expect from
him who is compelled by the exigencies of
his public life to treat with you. Hold your
own without committing yourselves and you
will always be in the only position which is
practically impregnable—that of dictators.

Poor and Proud.
They are eight: the father, the wife, and six
children. The father, by occupation a draughts-
man, since the Exposition is without work. Credit
is exhausted. They owe the baker, the butcher,
the grocer; the rent is past due. The furniture is
pawned, sold ; nothing is left but a bed and some
mattresses too bad for the pawnshop.
The man has sought work at his profession, but
has found none. He is strong; he has good arms
and great needs ; he offers his strength. He will
work at anything, it matters not what; but every-
where he meets the same disheartening response :
“ No work for you !” Out of work, out of money,
and six hungry children. “God,” said Briollet,
“blesses large families—only, He does not feed
them,”
The neighbours see the Hyems go and come.
They salute those they meet with a sad good day,
and if they speak of their troubles it is to give
vent to a brief complaint—the endless complaint
of the resigned. “ Things go badly ! The times
are hard ! Life is full of sorrows !” (Vnd, closing
their door they keep their misery to themselves.
The burdens of fate accumulate, and one day,
tired of the barren struggle, they abandon it.
“ My children,” says the father, “ I am going to
die. I am worn out. When you are orphans,
perhaps you will be taken care of.” The wife then,
as she has since said, interposed : “You shall not
go alone. I will die with you.” Together they
had emigrated ; they had dragged their misery
from land to land, worked and wandered together,
bent under their burdens ever. And this last
journey he would take without her ! “No, dear
one, once more shall we move on together.”
Matters were decided with an heroic simplicity
“But the children?” Some were of an age too
tender to understand, like the last, who could but
say: “I’m hungry, mamma,” clinging to her
skirts. But some were grown, too. There were
Helene, Bertha, a pretty girl of 15, a brunette
with fine eyes. A newspaper recalls this morning
that paradox which Augustine Brohant dared
write in an album ; “ All sensible people prefer by
far dishonour to death.” Bertha totally lacked
sense ; she preferred death. She hesitated not a
moment. She had no thought that there are
means of evading starvation when one is a woman
with fine eyes. “That is it!” she cried, with
enthusiasm; “that’s it; let us all die together.”
“It will be as if we were asleep,” said Helene,
younger by two years.
Sunday, July 13, all the family went out. It
was a holiday; the streets were decorated; there
was dancing in the squares. This part of
Charbnne was in high gaiety. Paris was cele-
brating the fete of the Federation, which, a
hundred years ago, had thrown men into one
another’s arms. To the Republican legend that
ceremony had affixed its third sentiment,
“Fraternity”—which last Sunday was seen
written everywhere. The poor family wandered
among the joyous crowds, their sorrow made the
more sorrowful. Dejected, they went by hazard,
seeing what they would never see again, the
smaller lagging behind, as they turned to admire
longer these wonderful preparations—which made
them open wide their eyes—eyes that in a few
hours would be closeed for ever by a sinister death.
The father entered a wine merchant’s and
ordered two glasses of cognac, one after another.
“ I’ll pay for them to-morrow,” he said. Already
in the streets the tables were being arranged for
the kermesse, which was to last all night long and
even the next day. Perhaps some gallant, seated
at a table, excited with the day’s pleasures, might
have noticed with persistence that Bertha was a
fine lass. So much the more—this detail is given
us by the neighbours—since she had arranged her
hair with care for this last promenade, an un-
conscious act of coquetry which with most
women survives every catastrophe. But of the
looks fixed on her she felt neither the
caress, nor the invitation, nor the homage; she
passed along with her own, resigned and melan-
choly. And when, after returning home, the
father said : “Some one must go down and get
the charcoal!” she answered without hesitation :
“ I’ll go!”
They had saved 12 sous for the ghastly work.
She took them and sped away to the charcoal-
dealer’s. She wore a strange air, which struck
the people who noticed her. She remounted the
stairs. They prepared the charcoal brazier, one
helping the other. They stopped up the openings.
They embraced one another; they prayed together;
they lay down—the mother on the bed with the
youngest child ; the father near her; the others,
side by side, on the floor. And they waited, in
sleep or in tears. Toward four o’clock in the
morning, the father arose and relighted the
brazier. An hour of anguish followed. The
mother, who survived, has narrated, it seems,
that Helene cried out, that the father threw him-
self toward his daughter. But from that moment
the mother lost consciousness.
How long did the agony of each of these un-
happy ones last? They were found after four
days; their corpses were already decomposing.
Mine. Hyem, by a miracle, lived. When fresh
air was admitted to the room, she came out of her
lethargy, stretched herself out on the bed, and
saw around her the bodies of those whom she had
loved. Death had had the cruelty to let her live.
She spoke with coherence, her voice harsh, her
eyes in vacancy, frightened, frightful. And it
was only from her fragmentary utterances that
could be constructed, by supplying the omissions,
the history of the most fearful tragedy that desti-
tution has yet engendered.
“When a death by starvation is reported in the
streets of Paris, it is said, ‘ His own fault!’ ”
exclaims M. Jules Simon, in the Family Review
of the current fortnight. “ People hope to justify
themselves with that. Perhaps it was his own
fault; but certainly it is yours. We are all
responsible for the hopeless, for there would be
none if we did our duty.”
We have not done our duty by the Hyems. We
shall in vain, to put asleep our conscience, plead
an alibi, say we knew not that they were reduced
to such extremities, that they did not importune
the department of charities. For there remains
this mortal shame, this horrible crime; a father
and mother, brave, esteemed, honourable, indus-
trious, have killed their children and have willed
their own death, because worn out by hunger.
And that in high national fete, the day of the
centennial of the most beautiful of fetes, that of
fraternity. —Translated from Paris “ L’Eolaib.”
often seen in Ceylon papers, and is no mere joke.
It is by this means that the crocodile-hunters
secure their bait. It is no trouble for an English
crocodile-hunter to get these little children. The
Ceylon parents have full confidence in English-
men, and they will rent out their babies to be
used for crocodile-bait for a small sum. The Cey-
lon crocodiles are lazier than any other and are
harder to get. They lie for hours perfectly
motionless, basking in the sun. Hardly anything
can stir them. But when tempted by a fat Ceylon
baby placed on the banks of the stream, they
shake off their ennui, and their mouths water for
a delicate morsel of brown baby. The crocodile
gathers himself together and starts out for the
infant. When he gets about half-way up the bank
the hunter, concealed behind some reeds, opens
fire and gets his game. Then the baby is taken
home to its loving parents, to be used for the same
purpose next day.
The Red-Headed Girl.
Oh, give me the girl with the auburn hair!
The lass with the peachblow curls;
The one that the white horse always is neftie,
For she’s the boss of all girls.
The one whose topknot is flamingly red—
The colour we paint the town—
Of a rosy tinge, most luridly spread
O’er a carroty, sunset crown.
Oh, give me the girl whose cranium’s hued
With Harvard’s selected shade;
The tint of neckties worn by the dude,
The pink of the blushing maid.
The one with the wavy, raspberry bang,
That casts forth fiery rays;
Whose cherry bean-catchers witchingly hang
Like bunches of currants ablaze.
Oh, give me the girl whose hirsute tuft
Is of a rubicund hue;
Whose silken tresses, all frizzled and puffed,
Remind one of claret for two.
The girl whose crest like a radish glows
With a perpetual glare,
That scorches the soul till love hot grows,
And burns for the warm heart there.
Oh, give me girl with the ketchup crop,
Crab apple, cranberry tinged ;
Whose dome’s adorned with a tomato mop,
All crinkled and coiled and fringed,
With a sorrel Psyche knot on her pate,
Like grape juice, or old port wine—
With the coral, the ruby, garnet plait,
Like peppers or drug-store twine.
Oh, give me the girl with the gold-fish crimps;
With ringlets like beefsteak rare;
The one with the locks of friecaseed shrimps—
The one with the lobster hair;
The wienerwurst, frankfurt-sausage girl
With the soft shell crab-like braids,
For the one with the danger-signal curl
Lies over all other maids.
So give me the girl whose canopy’s down
Is rouge, like a toy balloon ;
Whose cupola’s capped with a scarlet crown
Of carnation, brick, maroon.
The one with the strawberry knob, so fair,
She’ll make things torrid through life ;
Oh, give me the girl with the raw meat hair—
The red-headed girl for a wife !
Frederick Goldthwaite, in N.Y, Clipper.

“The Conventional Lies
of our Civilisation.”
THE ECONOMIC LIE,-CHAPTER IV. (Concluded.)
BY MAX NORDAU.
1 cannot deny for a moment that the practical
realisation of this scheme would at first meet with
In uiy and difficult obstacles. The parents would
try to escape from the necessity of bequeathing
their property to the State by presenting it
to their children and others while they
were still alive. This would result in the
practical inheritance of a part of their patrimony
by the children, and it could only be prevented by
the State with difficulty. Butthis source of fraud
is of very small importance to the system as a
whole. The adoption of it would exert such an
influence upon the views and opinions of humanity
that they would soon be radically changed from
what they are at present. The parents would
learn to appreciate the fact that in the new, re-
organised community, lack of furniture did not
mean poverty and wretchedness for the child,
consequently the impulse to ensure a regular in-
come to it through life would become much
weaker. The State would find little or no trouble
in getting control of the notes, bonds, stocks, &c.,
w uch form the greater part of the floating capital
of the World ; all household goods, works of art
aid single objects of value might be exempted
f'O n confiscation and retained by the children as
m -mentoes of their parents ; there would be no
possibility for evading the law in the matter of
real estate. But the most important, indeed, the
only essential point of the whole system is this :
the land with all the hous-s, builiings, factories,
trading establishments, &c., that are on it, must
become the unalienable property of the community
and come into its direct possession at the close of
each generation. Anyone desirous of owning land
or factories, will receive a title to them for his
life-time from the State, for which he must pay
an annual rental, which will be a certain per-
centage of the total amount of capital repre-
sented.
* # *
This idea is no unprecedented revolutionary in-
novation, as some would suppose, but merely the
further development of certain conditions existing
at the present day in many countries, especially
in England and Italy. In these countries there
are many landed proprietors who do not culti-
vate their land with their own hands, but rent it
as tenant-farmers. There is nothing to prevent
society from placing the manufacturer and the
tillers of the soil upon the same footing as the
English tenant farmer, with one great proprietor
as the master of them all : the State. This
arrangement of the economic world would make
it possible for the single individual to accumulate
personal property by his sagacity and industry as
at present, although not to such an enormous
extent as the fortune; of the pirates and parasites
of our modern civilisation. The talented, the
industrious man would find in a more luxurious
manner of living the reward for Ins greater ability
or efforts, mediocre capabilities and the indo-
lent man would be obliged to live more frugally,
while the individuals who shirked or refused to
work would be the only ones condemned to want.
The accumulation of enormous quantities of land
in the possession of one single tenant could not
occur, as he would experience such difficulty in
finding labourers to till his land, owing to the fact
that as anyone willing to work could rent land
from the State, no one would have any induce-
ment to drudge for another when he could lie his
own master and enjoy the blessings and fruits of
independence. The development of the system
leads necessarily to a condition in which each
individual would require only so much land as he
alone, or with the help of his family, could suc-
cessfully cultivate. The unnatural development
of manufacturing industries at the expense of the
agricultural would thus be prevented. For as
the individual would have it in his power to
become an independent farmer as easily as a
factory operative, he would not enter upon the
latter career unless it offered him a pleasanter
and more profitable existence than farming,
and the multitudes now seeking work in such
numbers in the factories, underbidding each other,
and satisfied with the very smallest p ssible
amount of life’s goods and enjoyments, such a
class would be inconceivable in a society re-
organised according to this system. Real
difficulties in carrying it out would not arise
until the country became too densely populate 1
and the soil exhausted. When these conditions
arrive, and it is found impossible to supply all
demands for productive land and factories, then a
part of the young people must decide upon
emigration. However, an extremely intensive
cultivation of the soil, such .as I mentioned above,
will postpone this necessity to a far-distant future.
9 9 9
There is no doubt but what this system is a
kind of Communism. But let him who shudders
and turns pale at this word remember that we are
living now in the midst of a complete Com-
munism, only it is a passive instead of an active
Communism. We have no community in posses-
sions, but we have a community in debts. No
one is shocked at the fact that every citizen,
merely on account of his being a citizen of the
State, is debtor to an amount varying in different
countries —in some countries it is over £lOO
per capita. Why should anyone be shocked
at the idea of the citizen owning, instead of
owing, in consequence of a complete revolution, a
corresponding amount of property, if the State
should possess common property as well as
common debts ? In such a case the State would
not be always taking taxes from its citizens, but
distributing benefits among them, as it now does
to a small number of them, comprising the privi-
leged class. Besides, the State already possesses
property of all kinds in buildings, lands, forests,
ships, &c. The existence of this property, which
is certainly not individual possessions, but
belongs collectively and individually to all the
citizens together, is certainly communism, but
it is not recognised as such by the people because
the forms of government and the public institu-
tions inherited from the Middle Ages favour the
idea that this, common property is an individual
property belonging to the king or ruler of the
state whoever he may be. The public debts,
public property, or taxation are not the only forms
in which Communism exists in our civilization.
Certain kinds of credits are nothing hut the
rankest Communism. When one man lends
another money from his pocket, or offers him a
draft secured by a mortgage, upon his private for-
tune, which is accepted by a third person like so
much cash, then it is practically an exchange of
individual property. But when a bank offers un-
secured notes in circulation—and in many banks
Uie amount of unsecured notes is a third or more
of the entire number of notes in circulation—and
gives a man in exchange for his signature on a
note a number of these Unsecured notes with
which he can go forth and buy anything he wishes,
then the transaction is an act of the most com-
plete Communism. The bank does not give its
saved-up labour, that is gold, but a certificate for
certain labour to be performed in the future. The
fact that the community will give up goods, re-
ceiving these unsecured notes in exchange, is a
proof of the respect in which mankind holds this
principle of human solidarity and a recognition of
the concomitant fact that the individual member
of the community has a right to share in the goods
exist ng in it, even when he cannot offer in ex-
change for this share any personally-produced
equivalent.
# # *
The absorption of all goods into the public pro-
perty after the death of the accumulator would
lead to an almost inexhaustible public fund,
without interfering with individual possession.
Each member of the community would have
then his individual and general property as he
has his baptismal and family name. The pub-
lic property with which he is born is like
his family name, the private fortune which
he accumulates during the course of his
life and of which he is the sole, unmolested pro-
prietor and usufructuary, is his baptismal name,
and both taken together represent his economic
personality as the names represent his personality
as a citizen. While he is toiling for himself he is
working for the community, which will some day
fall heir to all the surplus remaining after his ex-
penditures have ceased. The public fortune will
be a vast reservoir, receiving the surplus of the
rich and dealing out blessings to the poor, regain-
ing its normal level once in every generation and
thus equalising the inequalities in the distribution
of property, which inheritance on the contrary,
fixes indelibly and increases in each generation.
# * *
To such a new arrangement of the pdtieo-
economical organisation of society the world must
come at last, because reason and the ideas of man-
kind in regard to man and the universe ba ed
upon natural science demand it One single
fundamental principle must govern society, and
this principle must be either individualism, that
is, egotism or the solidarity, the cohesive fellow
ship of mankind, that is, altruism. At the present
day neither fellowship nor egotism are ruling
alone, but a combination of both, which is as un-
reasonable as it is inconsistent. Possession is
organised upon a personal basis and egotism
reaches in the laws governing inheritance the
utmost limits to which it can attain, by not only
seizing by stealth and violence everything that it
Can lay bands on, but by clinging to the plunder
for ever and ever and excluding the rest < f man-
kind from ever sharing in its benefits. The man
of property, however, will not allow the Ulan with-
out property to call that princi le to his aid to
which the former owes his wealth. Fortum s
are accumulated in the name of, iudi idualism ;
but they are defended in the name of human
solidarity. The rich man enjoys his dis-
proportionate share of life’s blessings of which he
has made himself master by unblushing egotism ;
but when the poor man helps hi nisei to them with
some of the rich man’s egotism and selfishness, he
is arres'ed. In the form of usury and speculation
the un crupulous furtherance of self-interest is
allowable, but it is strictly forbi deli when it
takes the form of robbery and theft. The same
principle applied in the former case is a meiit, hi
the other a crime. Human reason r. volts at s eh
ideas. If egoti misto be preached, let it be con-
sistent and assert its right in all cases. If it is
right for the rich man to luxuriate in a life of
leisure because he has been able to get po session
of landed estates or to take advantage of the
labour of others, then it must also be conceded to
by right for the poor man to strike him dead and
take possession of his property as the spoils of
victory, if he has the courage and strength to
undertake and carry through such an undertak-
ing. This is logical. It is true that such logic
would soon bring society to destruction and our
civilisation to the dogs, and men would become
like beasts of prey wandering alone through the
land and tearing each other to pieces, But anyone
who is not pleased with this abstract aim of our
social development, egotism, has ro other alterna-
tive before hun but to accept the other sole prin-
ciple, fellowship. The motto will no longer be :
E' eryone for himself; but: One for all and all for
each. Society will then assume the responsibility
of supporting and educating the youth of the
country until they can earn their own livelihood,
of supporting those too old and feeble to support
themselves, of coming to the aid of infirmity,
without allowing hunger and distress to exist
except as the punishm ent of voluntary idleness.
But these responsibilities can only be accepted
and fulfilled upon one condition : the abolition of
the right of inheritance.

Great catastrophes are looming up on the field
of political economy and it will not be possible to
ignore them much longer. So long as the masses
were religious, they could be consoled for their
wretchedness on earth by promises of unlimited
bliss in the future. But to-day they are becoming
more enlightened, and the number of those pat ent
sufferers is daily growing less who find in the
Host a satisfactory substitute for their dinner and
accept the priests' order on the place waiting for
them in paradise with as much pleasure as if it
were some good terrestrial farm of which they
could take immediate possession. The poor count
their numbers and those of the rich and realise
that they are constantly growing more numerom
and stronger than the latter. They examine the
sources of wealth and they find that speculating,
plundering and inheriting have no more rational
justification for existing than robbery and theft,
and yet the latter are prosecuted by the laws.
The increasing disinheritance of the masses by
their deprivation of land and by the increasing
accumulations of property in the hands of a few,
will make the economic wrongs more and more
intolerable. The moment that the millions acquire
in addition to their hunger, a knowledge of the
remote causes to which it is due, they will remove
and overthrow all obstacles that stand between
them and the right of sati fying their appetite.
Hunger is one of the few elementary forces which
neither threats nor persuasion can permanently
control. Hence it is the power which will pro-
bably raze the present structure of society level
with the ground, in spite of its foundations of
superstition and selfishness —a task beyond the
power of philosophy alone.
