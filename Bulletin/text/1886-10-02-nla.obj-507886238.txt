A Mess of Missionary Pottage.
When the New Hebridean question is dis-
passionately investigated, the result of the
examination contrasts very strongly with the
turmoil ' which Australian Agcnts-General
and politicians and the diplomatists of
France and England are keeping up in that
connection. The contention is intrinsically
not an Anglo-French dispute at all. Eng-
lish statesmen do not want the New
Hebrides. Pursuing an hereditary senti-
ment of jealousy of the French people,
English politicians have, indeed, with some
hyper-sensitiveness dogged the steps of
France in the direction of these islands, and
so slight was the appreciation of the group
on the part of both nations, that no diffi-
culty was found in arranging a convention
that neither Power should appropriate them.
Such an arrangement was clearly a mere
postponement of a bargain to be struck at
some future period. In any other sense it
was ridiculous. No two nations would sub-
ject themselves to a self-denying ordinance
which practically invited any third nation to
snap up the bone of contention. France did
not need the islands ; England did not want
them. But conditions altered. The third
party appeared upon the scene. Germany,
the deadly rAal of France, stretched out her
claws across the globe. This Power appro-
priated from under the very nose of Great
Britain a portion of New Guinea, with a
sardonic disregard of a formal previous an-
nouncement by a great English Minis-
ter that such a step would be re-
garded as “an unfriendly act.” Almost
simultaneously the Teuton swooped
upon New Ireland and New Britain, the
Caroline Islands, part of the Solomons,
and other groups. Her naval officers at-
tempted a coup at Samoa. Thereupon the
British Ministers, rubbing their slumberous
eyes, yet appearing insensible to the initial
slap in the face—the “unfriendly act”—
entered into an “ understanding ” with Ger-
many as to the limits of the enterprises of
the two nations in the Pacific. This under-
standing had for its starting-point a mild and
calm assumption that no other nation could
have any claims or rights in the matter.
The Pacific ocean and its innumerable archi-
pelagoes of unannexed islands were referred
to as though England and Germany mono-
polised the right to dispose of them. The
lines of partition were settled quite comfort-
ably without any reservation in favour of
French, Dutch, or Spanish sensibilities.
* * *
An immediate consequence, which can
occasion no surprise, was an instant quicken-
ing of French activity. If Great Britain
were insensible to the nose-pulling process,
France had a more delicate nervous organi-
sation. The New Hebrides lay right at the
doors of the French settlement at New Cale-
donia. England had undertaken not to
appropriate the islands, indeed. But although
Germany had assented to a limitation of its
enterprise which excluded the New Hebrides
from the scope of its annexations, the subse-
quent proceedings of that power in relation
to Samoa evinced a not too fine delicacy
about engagements, and after all the con-
tract was with England. No guarantee had
been offered to France. Now the hoisting
of the German flag in the New Hebrides
would have constituted a mortal affront to
France. Naturally desirous of rendering
such an event impossible, the French Govern-
ment suggested to England the termination
of the mstiiig Q'jmmWm, They desired
that they might possess themselves of the
group, and offered as an equivalent two con-
cessions. They would cede to Great Britain
the island of Rapa, which possessed a strate-
gical importance quite unmistakeable. They
added to this a further offer particularly ad-
dressed to the sensibilities of Australians :
they would cease to deport relapsed criminals
to the Pacific. These were fair offers. The
first alone constituted an equivalent which
was at once regarded as ample by Imperial
officials. The second comprised a complete
concession of all that Australians had up to
that time demanded. The Imperial British
authorities were ready to accept the terms,
when a fresh aspect was imparted to the
case.
* * *
Sundry Presbyterian missionaries had been
“ labouring” in the New Hebrides. Among
the results of their self-sacrificing exertions
were the titular possession, by barter of
heavenlygrace or other intangible and similar
commodities of missionary commerce, of great
tracts of territory. The missionaries objected
to be ousted from their heavenly work and
their earthly estate. - It so happened that at
the head of affairs in one leading Australian
colony was a Scotch Premier, who relied ex-
clusively upon the Kirk to maintain him in
power, in lieu of summoning him to do
penance in a white sheet for sundry alleged
departures from moral discipline. And it
simultaneously happened that in another
colony, the principal daily newspapers were
actually edited by brethren of the missionary
breed. Hence it happened that a woeful
clamour was raised, and every sort of pre-
posterous appeal to Jingoistic idiocy was
babbled and gabbled in the Southern Senate,
in the Northern daily Press, and in hun-
dreds of pulpits. Yet further North was
another Premier, whose father also was of
the missionary gang, and his son’s most
potent electioneering agent. Consequently,
from all points of the Australian compass,
an anti-Gallic clamour resounded. The old
“ French and English ” craze was revived.
Agents-General were instructed to protest.
Dispatches were concocted with all solemnity.
The foundations of the deep were moved.
Twopenny politicians shook their puny fists
in the faces of the British connection, and
spluttered at the French eagle. And all for
what ?
* * *
Under the splendid inspiration of the
Right Honorable Plain Bill D alley, Aus-
tralia has assumed the responsibilities of a
warlike power, on the strong compulsion of
an inward call to save the dear old mother
country in her hour of need, consequent on
her presumed inability to extricate her
armies from the clutches of some wretched
spear-armed Arabs fighting for the defence
of their native land. Similarly Australia
was brought to development as a factor
in international politics under the urgent
pressure of the anticipated annexation by
Frenchmen of an island group within a day’s
steaming of an already existant French
colony, which intervened between that group
and Australia ; the said group lying more
remote from Australia than the Moluccas or
Java.
* * *
To Australians, the Ne v Hebrides are of
no earthly use, and no conceivable import-
ance. The population of this continent is
already surcharged with a plethora of terri-
tory, crying aloud for occupation and recla-
mation. Not a man is disposable either for
foreign conquest or slaughter, or for distant
colonisation. Our own undisputed possession
—our island continent—requires fifty mil-
lions, nay, one hundred millions of people to
develope its latent resources. With regard
to external neighbours our lot is the most
fortunate conceivable. Poets and essayists,
orators and philosophers of all nations have
for centuries celebrated the fortunate situa-
tion of the people of Great Britain, ditched
around by an ocean Corso and thus protected
from hostile contact in their sea-girt isle.
But we, a thousand times more lucky, are
not, like our parent-race, cramped by narrow
limits and forced to burst bounds and to
adventure in far-regions in search of living-
room and scope for enterprise. There are
no trifling channels and narrow seas which
separate us from hereditary enemies. Vast
oceans roll around us and divide us from all
more powerful communities, and even there,
we, as Australians, have no hereditary foes.
More fortunate than our sires, we are en-
trenched, not in a sea-girt isle, but in an
ocean-circled continent, all our own. What
are the New Hebrides, these chips of land as
remote from our shores as Iceland is from
England, to us ! They are absolutely use-
less. Their possession would not merely be
valueless to Australia. Were possession to
be followed by colonisation, it would be
positively injurious. In peace it would
divert energy, population, enterprise, and
capital from our own continent, which suffers
from a dearth of each and all of these neces-
saries. In war, it would be a preposterous
possession. We could not hold it for a week
against the paltriest of the naval powers.
* * *
Aye, but, replies Sir Jingo, Great Britain
could hold it. True, possibly. But to what
end ? To serve what fruitful purpose ?
And—mark this I —at what cost to ourselves
should we exact this service from Great
Britain ? Is the game, this New Hebridean
prize, worth the candle ? Sagacious Aus-
tralian political leaders are desiring, nay,
commanding the rulers of Great Britain to
eject the French from the New Hebrides at
any cost, Suppose th§ task accomplished,
Great Britain will have run the. risk of im-
mediate war ; will have compromised her
position in the delicately-adjusted balance of
European politics; will have laid herself
open to humiliating embarrassments with
regard to her own unfulfilled pledges to
evacuate Egypt—all to preserve the New
Hebrides for the Australian people who don’t
need those islands and wouldn’t know what to
do with them were they placed at their dis-
posal. But the principle of Federal unity will
have had a clinching demonstration. “ Her
hour of need ” will be knelled for England yet
again. A disgraceful and immoral war
against national liberties in Burmah, in
Transvaal, in Ireland even, may be entered
upon by a Ministry anxious to divert atten-
tion from their domestic incapacity. How
at that hour will Australia be able decently
to refuse her co-operation in turn ? Her
contributions of money or of men she could
not decently with-hold. She would discover
then too late that she had sold her birth-
right a birthright of immunity from the
broils of an Empire upon whose quarrels, as
upon whoso territory the sun never sets,
and the musketry rattle of which rolls round
the globe as constantly as the beat of the
British drum for a mess of missionary
pottage.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Get Out !
The New South Wales Assembly has kicked the
“Australian Centennial” proposals out, and the
country is very well content with the Assembly
for so doing. The country only requires a little
more education to fall as a mountain upon any
showman who proposes to serve himself by un-
covering the national shame. How can we avoid
shame, how escape contempt, if we deal with the
facts of our first 20 or 30 years? And what is the
use of Sir Patrick Jennings quoting those re-
markable prophecies of Governor Phillip ? Can
ho fill in the picture ? Can he paint the audience ?
Can he point back, not to the Governor only, but
to the governed, and say to his audience, whether
it be the Assembly of to-day or the “assembled
nations” of 1888: “These be our progenitors ” ?
And it is all folly to say that the free population
swamped the convicts in one or two years or one
or two decades. Sydney was a gaol and a brothel
for 30 years. It was intended so to be. Here,
now, is a picture of the year 1815. “ When a ship
arrives boats crowd around her, and visitors choose
among the female prisoners a wife or such other re-
lation as might answer to their prior engagements.
Those females whoso appearance or dullness ex-
cluded them from these resources were taken to
the factory. On their arrival, according to cus-
tom, they were mot by a body of men who, having
satisfied the constables, spread before these
women the spirits and provisions provided for the
feast of welcome. What followed need not be
told.” And Governor Macquarie, writing to Earl
Bathurst in 1813, says : —“ In my opinion (speaking
of the voluntary settlers) they should consider
they are coming to a convict colony, and if they
are too proud or too delicate in their feelings to
associate with the population of this colony they
should consider in time and bend their courses to
some other part.” And lest there should ever be
any doubt upon the conditions which really did
exist, a return was prepared in the year 1820
which showed the people out of gaol to be in all
15,851, of whom 13,115 were emancipists and only
2136, in the jargon of the time, “ pure merinoes.”
There is something of course immensely interesting
in such conditions, lots of romance about it, lots
of subjects for fine historical paintings—scenes,
indeed unique in history. What other land could
supply such an instance as this : —“ Fond of dis-
pensing mercy he (Governor Macquarie) ap-
pointed a day when those who thought themselves
entitled crowded his presence. The concourse of
suppliants was often very great, many venturing
to ask who did not hope to obtain, and whose sole
claim to mercy was the bad terms on which they
lived with the law. The crowd pressed on with
their petitions, which the Governor read in their
presence, and by one letter of the alphabet ” (sic—
one word ?) “ gave liberty to the impatient captives
or sent them back to merit freedom as freedom was
then merited.” “ The court of Clemency,” says Dr.
John West, “ thronged by suitors, would have
afforded a fine subject to the artist.” Certainly it
should not be missed when we begin to commemo-
rate. But what folly is the whole business ! Why,
if Americans chose to search their annals, they
might discover a very similar beginning, for his-
tory records how Columbus, departing upon his
third voyage with intent to work the mines, find-
ing it impossible to induce free men to accompany
him, besought the court to make order that he
should be supplied with prisoners from the galleys,
and this request was granted. But America
waited and so can we —those of us at least who
are, not expecting dukedoms or billets.

His Excellency the Governor.
While members of the New South Wales Assembly
are casting avaricious eyes on the incomes of
underlings in the Civil Service and discussing
projects for a general reduction of the smaller
salaries, it is noticeable that no effort is made to
cut down the very handsome salary and per-
quisites of the first of our alleged public ser-
vants, “ His Excellency thd Governor.” Whether
measured by his duties, the colony’s revenue, or
emoluments gained by officers of State in other
countries, Lord Carington’s pay is outrageously
disproportionate. He gets £7OOO a year clear, but
to this must be added his perks, in the way of
forage, residences in the Domain and at Moss
Vale, and cost of repairs thereto, special trains,
right of free-iraport (which right last week was
successfully claimed for a picture valued at £2000),
besides Secretary’s salary, £lOO, and salary and
allowances together £6BO for aide-de-camp, to-
gether with numberless other charges, which run
the total cost of the vice-regal establishment up
to £20,000 at least. But supposing the cost to the
colony of the Carington establishment to be the
amount of the salary alone, this of itself would be
a public extortion ; the President of the United
States, who is chief magistrate over a republic of
sixty millions, receives only £lO,OOO per annum ;
the British Minister in the States, only £6OOO ;
and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
only £5OOO. The Presidentship of the United
States, compared with the Governorship of
New South Wales should, on the basis of
population, be worth £190,000 per year ; pro rata
on a revenue standard £170,000, and if calculated
according to the amount of ability needed for the
due fulfilment of its duties, the salary would, at
the rate prevailing here, cuq into incalculable bib
lions. We don't say that Carington has not
more brains than are needed for the figure-head
of a tramcar, but if he has, the position does nob
require their employment. He is merely the Bag-
man of Royalty sent out here in the interests of
his Imperial mistress ; his one mission is to make
himself a popular sample product of Imperialism,
and being a fairly energetic young man he suc-
ceeds moderately well in winning the cheap ap-
plause of the designing and the thoughtless sec-
tions of the community. But such service on be-
half of a monarchical system, Which at least half
of our citizens regard with aversion, either silent
or avowed, is but small recompense to then! fob
the burden of taxation which it entails ; and the
knowledge that a large part, if not all of the
amount annually voted is spent in entertaining
the duchesses of Potts Point and the marchionesses
of Macquarie-street, is not likely to recompense
the hardy back-blqcker for his share of the tax.
Apart from all questions as to the uses of a
Governor at all, the money at present paid for the
doubtful boon is excessive, and beyond what is
just or necessary. If members really wish to save
the money of the taxpayers, the Government
House schedule is worthy of the first attention.
Sir Alfred Stephen is on the list to the tune of
£3500 a sum which would seem to be
enormous recompense for the very occasional
duties devolving upon the Lieutenant-Governor.
Any popularity-hunting politician can move for
reduction in the salary of a clerk who drives his
quill for £2OO a year, but it will possibly be a
long time before anyone ventures to attempt the
curtailment of the salary of a Carington or a
Stephen.

“The Poah Prince.”
A lady, filled with a beautiful devotion to Lord
Carington, writes to England to another lady sick
nigh unto death with adoration for the poah Prince
of Wales. “See how the poor lord works,” says
one. “See how the deah prince slaves,” responds
the other, depth calling on to depth in the ocean
of slobbery. But the lady at “home”—the Prince’s
lady—enumerates the labours of her idol. He gets
up in the morning, mark you ; he breakfasts—so
do we all when there’s anything in the meal-chest
—he holds a levee at eleven, ho meets the four-in-
hand club at one, and he lunches with them all;
he has another reception at three, he entertains a
party at nine, and he goes to Aldershot by the
11.30 train. There is a list of herculean labours 1
a catalogue of tasks accomplished on a salary of a
few hundreds a day. He has no time to devote to
petty questions of diplomacy, to interviews with
premiers or statesmen. Society claims all, to
receive and to lunch, to receive and to dine, to go
down to Aldershot and sleep and breakfast and
receive again. Who would be a prince to suffer
thus, even at the rate of £250,000 a year ? But in
the radical and rational, and it may be most
damnably universal mind, the question rises
why tortuio the poor fellow thus? Would
the wheels of the world stop if the “Poah
Prince ” had a spoil ? Society would languish,
doubtless, as society languished through all the
years while Lord Loftus .nursed his chickens and
his salary in Sydney. But what would the wide
world care ? What has the world or Australia or
New South Wales gained by all the showman
business recently enacted at Government House,
Sydney ! Are any great things improved, any vile
conditions ameliorated ? Is there less hunger in
our streets, less complaining amongst our working
population ? Are our loans better regarded in the
old world ? Are literature, art, science, a little
more esteemed amongst our wealthy folk ? Nay,
but millinery is much improved, and lessons in
dancing and deportment are in more request, and
every well-to-do tradesman who has got a back-
yard in a back suburb fences it in, and gives an
“at home,” but the people who make the land
keep at home and laugh, and will continue to
laugh, till they think they have paid the piper
long enough, and then—well, we will wait till the
time comes. •

A Society of St. Anthonys.
A ghastly burlesque'on Home Missions in Sydney
is that bumptious organisation known as the
White Cross Society, whose members meet periodi-
cally to listen to exhortations from their spiritual
pastors and masters, and to discuss the exceed-
ingly immoral influence which cigarette adver-
tising pictures, suburban ball-ro mis, and the
theatres are supposed to possess over their weaker
brethren. These doughty reformers are bound by
a common tie, in the form of an oath, never “to
harm a female or to see one harmed.” The clergy,
who are alleged to constitute a third sex, may by
some process of casuistry be enabled to reconcile
themselves to such an oath, but it is incomprehen-
sible that any real man can do so. As well ask a
man to bind himself to abstain from arson, pre-
meditated murder, or perjury, as to take this
White Cross oath. What is the attitude of such
pious purists ? They pose as reformers of public
morals and yet by their very bond of union
openly confess that they have to bind them-
selves by an oath not to do that which no self-
respecting man could degrade himself to do.
Bishop Barry, in a recent address, appealed to
‘ ‘ the sense of manliness in the breast of his
hearers ” to come forward and take this oath,
\ never to harm a female or see one harmed,” an
exhortation which is in itself a direct insult to
every instinct of manliness. The morality that is
inefficient to sustain itself unless propped up by
such an asseveration is a weak and useless article
which will certainly fail whether buttressed by
such frail supports or without them. Dr. Barky,
possibly to encourage these Sydney St. Anthonys,
likens them to the chivalrous knights of old—a
doubtful compliment, for as the reverend gentle-
man must know, these mediaeval adventurers
were in many instances accustomed to de-
mand the jus primae noctis from their helpless
retainers, and it is now generally admitted
that the virtues of the cavaliers were chiefly dis-
played in monkish manuscript, while their vices
were shown in their lives. It would be curious to
know what the weaker sex think of this noble
brotherhood, banded together in the cause of
purity. It may be that they regard them as a
high and holy company who have walled themselves
in with an oath to restrain themselves from vices
in which they would otherwise revel. Or they
may more reasonably think, “ If these pious young
men are so sensual and so weak that they have to
bind themselves by a vow, that vow will be to
them as a rope of sand. Our protectors ? Bosh,
they admit that they cannot yet protect themselves
from themselves.” This latter is the most reason-
able view, and the safest. The most dangerous is
that which would prompt trustful woman to re-
cognise these social reformers as devoted allies
against the machinations of immoral men, and
induce the to belief that the alliance justifies the
neglect of those modest moral restraints which would
otherwise be imposed. The results of such
Platonic familiarity would be disastrous in the
extreme. Choir practices, prayer meetings, Sal-
vation Army Services, and such assemblages are
fruitful of immorality, simply because the youth-
ful of both pluoe Ut the outset almost un-


limited confidence in the virtue of each other ; and
these White Cross men would be more dangerous
still if admired as paragons of manly virtue, be-
cause they professedly unite moral rectitude to
the piety already inherent in them, and also be-
cause they further aspire to the defence of others.
It is one man’s work to guard himself ; when he
aspires to guard others as well, his own defence
is in great danger of breaking down. Yet with
all this we believe that, such as their work is,
these St. Anthonys will have plenty of it. The
society has a large membership, and each member
has admitted his extreme frailty by taking an
empty oath. Each member will find heaps of
work in watching his fellow-members.
♦ r
Disinterested Affection.
The Queen’s speech at the recent prorogation of
the British Parliament contained, we are told by
cable, special reference to the interest evinced by
the people of the British isles in the welfare of
their Colonial and Indian fellow-subjects. This is
altogether gratifying. We may leave comment on
the interest felt in the Indian follow-subjects to
the vernacular native Press of India, which will,
doubtless, do justice to the theme, without ceasing
to denounce the arbitrary and selfish policy
which denies to the Indian fellow-subjects afore-
said the constitutional rights of Parliamentary re-
presentation and self-government, which is (next to
the Bible and the Koran) the secret of England’s
greatness. It will be sufficient for us to speak
for our own people. It is quite overwhelming,
this interest so kindly and obligingly displayed.
But perhaps it might have appeared just a shade
more unmistakeably disinterested had it been
evinced a little earlier when we needed it more.
It is awkward in some degree that this gush of
feeling should have been delayed until the colonies
have become England’s best trade customers, and
a good deal more important and necessary to the
mother country, in a commercial and sordid sense,
if not, indeed,. also in a political sense, than
the mother country is now to the colonies.
Men not yet gray-haired can readily remember the
different countenance shown by English Royalty
and people to colonial fellow-subjects while yet
these communities were weakly and struggling.
Colonials are not all gudgeons to be caught by
anything. In another century Australians will—if
monarchical institutions be not then extinct and
regarded as memories of days of darkness
and ignorance—probably be insisting that the
Sovereign of the British Empire shall per-
manently reside in Australia, and will decline
to allow the Heir Apparent or any member of the
royal circle to visit the British Isles during a
jubilee year. But perhaps before such things
come to such a pass Australia will have imported
the entire British nation, Court and all, in one
consignment, as a mere job lot, and be making use
of the receptacle for Australian recidivists to the
great but impotent indignation of the European
Republics.
—♦
The Tenterfleld (N.S.W.) Star in an ably written
jibe at the proposed bogus “ Centenary ” denounces
that outpouring of malarious gush in these
terms: —
“ The status that this colony occupies to-day has, we un-
hesitatingly affirm, been brought about by the obscure toilers
in the lonely bush, whose exemplary perseverance and un-
complaining assiduity has transformed barren wastes into
fertile fields. And now that their labours have borne fruit,
the drones of society, as represented in the metropolis (and
we do not here refer exclusively to politicians, but to the so-
called leaders o{ society, who are never heard of outside the
drawing-room) wish to step in and take all the credit to
•themselves, while the actual workers will bs ignored alto-
gether.”
We rise to second these observations. If this
decomposed Centenary ever comes off, the honours
will be absorbed chiefly by men who hare gazed
out from above a loose-hung jaw in amazement at
the work others were doing—by men who have
turned politicians because they lacked the intel-
lect to be grocers or the energy to push a wheel-
barrow —and by our “aristocracy,” consisting
largely of men who have been given titles because
it was impossible on the spur of the moment to
find a decent excuse for hanging them. We had a
jubilee of these and other equally objectionable
individuals not long since—we don’t want any-
thing more. In the eloquent language of Seigel’s
syrup, we would ask, ‘ ‘ What is this disease that
is creeping upon us ?” and in reply we can only
say that we guess it must be either jaundice or
centenary, and of the two we devoutly hope it is
only jaundice.

the standard of the Act.” We congratulate Frank,
but withold our admiration from the standard
raised by the Act.
Ihree ounces per ton is the latest yield at
Rockhampton (Q.), a benighted district where the
mine 3, with the exception of the famous Mount
Morgan, have hitherto returned no gold worth
speaking of and scarcely enough brass to the
square mile to plate Coonan’s cheek.
Somebody proposes that the Queen’s
Jubilee year shall be celebrated by the issue of
new gold coin—an “ empress,” worth 255. This
suggestion has been enthusiastically received by
the hundreds of thousands of Englishmen who
support large families on a screw of 20s. a week
or less.
The Cooma (N.S. W.) Express advertises
for “a literary slush man or itinerant editor who
is mean and contemptible enough to sneak rounc
the district and write lying pars, anonymous
correspondence, pirated leaders, and other literary
garbage. None but a cool, calculating, unprin-
cipled, and polished liar need apply for the billet.”
An Adelaide newsboy has made a small
fortune. He stood on the steps of the Y.M.C. A.
and bellowed up to the sacred glory-pole above :
“’Ere ya are, ’sdress or Jernal, full account of
the ’orrible outrage in Sydney! ” And the
Y.M.C.A. rolled up as one bank-thief and bought
him out for fear he would go and scatter that per-
nicious literature about the city.
The very latest in the way of optical in-
struments is a pair of spectacles having a silvered
area on the inner edge*of the glasses which enables
the wearer to see objects lying out of the direct
field of vision. This fills a long-felt want. The
Civil servant, when doing the block, will now be
able to look round the corners and cover the ap-
proach of the long-suffering tailor.
A giddy, gushing young missionary thing,
who has just returned from New Guinea, says,
according to the S. M. Herald, that “he dis-
covered as much innate modesty in the female sex
of that Island as in the highest circles of society.”
This malarious youth should really have stayed in
New Guinea. Unless he is understating his case
there must be plenty of scope for him there.
A correspondent writes us from Casino,
N.S.W. : —“A weird occurrence recently even-
tuated in a certain town in northern N. S. W. A
man died in the local hospital. While proceeding
to bury him at night, his bearers approached a
public-house, set the bier down in the footpath
and adjourned for a beer. A woman passing by
in the dark fell over the coffin. Imagine her
feelings!”
That ’orrible tragedy in a Melbourne
hoyster shop quite unnerved the Herald reporter
who was sent to got up particulars. This is how
he went on ; “ She fell upon the floor evidently
lifeless. . . How she could have jumped up
again and rushed down the staircase to the shop
is a singular thing.” Yes, bedad ! a most singular
thing. They must have kept oysters of super-
natural strength at that shop.
The English Mining Journal, which is
regarded—in England—as authoritative, reports
that 20,0000 z. gold have been obtained at
Kimberley, that the output still continues large,
and that there is every prospect of a vast field
being opened. Ananias in his best days was not
fit to sweep out the office of a reliable British
newspaper, especially if it is owned by a church-
warden and run by a mining expert.
On a certain Barcoo station a well was
being sunk, and the contractors, running short of
blasting-powder, applied to the storekeeper. He
had no powder, but said he had some dynamite
which he could supply them with. This they
took and attempted to use, but though the
cartridges ignited and made a great smoke and
smell they would do no more. Close examination
revealed the fact that the supposed cartridges
were horse-balls.
The Eov. Mr. Dixon, just now lecturing
in Melbourne, says that Buddhism is doomed in
Japan, and the Mikado will soon govern a Chris-
tian nation. We are sorry for that. Our respect
for the old Japanese religion has been considerable
ever since that “ Village ” came here. From in-
quiries made in the temple we learned that one
of the Jap. gods (the little one in the middle,
standing in a sort of summer-house) was named
O’Shanassy, or a slight corruption of that name.
We thought he looked a broth of a bhoy.
While the grampus-built steamer Burdekin
was crawling towards Townsville on a squally,
pitch-black night, a scream like that of a squashed
whale arose from the deep. A small boat was
seen for a moment under the port-bow, and then
it vanished again into the darkness. The engines
were immediately stopped, and after 10 minutes
of breathless suspense the little craft ranged once
more alongside, and then a nude aboriginal, who
looked like an unclean ghoul, stood up in the
canoe and whined, “You got him backer, blease ? ”
What the reporters call a “singular
affair ” happened in Melbourne last week. In the
dead of night a tall young man engaged a cab to
drive him to the city end of Princes’ Bridge. The
tall young man alighted, and cabby stretched out
his little hand for the fare. Without paying any
attention to that significant gesture, the tall Y.M.
thus addressed cabby : “ She’s not here ; she’s be-
hind time. The water’s wet.” Then he threw
down his hat and stick and bolted. It is suggested
that the tall young man subsequently drowned
himself. If so, he has discovered that the Yarra
water is not wet —only sticky. The dead ’uns
who are fished out of that stream are no more
wet than a fly recovered from the treacle-jar.
They say Sir Patrick Jennings will be
made a bart. We don’t believe there’s a barticle
of truth in the rumour.
A heavy storm has been raging in N.Z.,
and for several days a tremendous surf beat on
the shores of Otago, especially on the exposed and
naked coast between Timaru and Port Chalmers.
After it had subsided the sands were found to be
impregnated with gold which had been cast up by
the sea, and a large number of men are making
good wages. Apparently the great deposits of the
future are under the ocean, and some day, when
the diving apparatus has been brought to perfec-
tion, a submarine rush may take place which will
completely wipe out the memories of Ballarat and
Bendigo.
The North Australian, published at
Palmerston, reports that 200 white madmen have
recently passed through that remote one-horse dog-
hole all bound for Kimberley. The assets of the com-
pany appeared to consist chiefly of a walking-stick
apiece and a good opinion of themselves. They
were in a hurry, but they stopped to fight the local
Chinamen as they passed—a proceeding which led
to disaster. A burly Celestial drummed up the
yellow gang, emptied a pot of newly-cooked rice
on the head of the foremost digger, and with a
rush that put Coonan’s miserable “charge” of
£2 14s. 6d. hopelessly in the shade, drove them
out of the town. The sun of the once proud
Caucasian seems to be on the decline. Once it was
his boast that one white man could lick a dozen
Chinkies, and now he is punched by a Buddhist
Who doesn’t even know about original sin.

result is that the average citizen on Sunday afternoon
“snoozes” like an alligator on a mud-bank. The especia

Notwithstanding the fact that 29 prayer-meet-
ings, 197 Bible-classes, and a grand Halleluiah,
all-night, very free and moderately easy Salvation
Army go-as-you-please were inviting their presence,
the sinful admirers of the noble art of nose-bashing
rolled up to the extent of over 1100 to see their
favourite science “exponed” by Messrs. Jackson
and Lees for oof to the tune of £2OO aside at
Deacon Foley’s chapel, Sydney, on Saturday night.
White predominated, but darkies attended so
largely as to give the hall a sort of piebald appear-
ance. Among the crowd also we observed a couple
of N.S.W. members of Parliament, who probably
came to compare a well-ordered and scientific fight
with the little affairs which are occasionally mis-
conducted under Ministerial patronage within the
halls of Legislature. A four-round interview be-
tween Molloy and O’Brien served as a first course
to the festival, and then Mr. Foley mounted the
stump and eloquently orated as follows Genel-
men (immense applause), we 'ave come to see a
fight, an’ all we want is that there’ll be fair play
an’ the best man win,” and having repeated the
above sentiment several times, called upon Mr.
George Seale to act as referee, and deputed Mr,
Joseph Thompson to hold the Waterbury. Then,
the sluggers being present, Mr. Jack Thompson
dilated upon the Queensberry rules, which unfor-
tunately ho had left at home on the ormolu
table in his boudoir, with such fullness
and fluency that his parliamentary candidature
for Botany Bay or Blackwattle Swamp may bo
regarded as one of the certainties of next century.
The rival pluggers were as widely different in
make as in complexion. Lees was thick and com-
pact, and being trained to the hour looked about
as well as it is possible for him to do with so few
garments on : the Professor when stripped was
statuesque to the waist, but decidedly otherwise
as to the balance of his figure. He seems to have
been built from the head downwards, and the
contractor appears to have slummed him after the
job was half through. He scaled 21 pounds more
than his opponent, but this, as the Christian
Chronicle man informed us, was all to the ad-
vantage of Lees because it gave him so much
more to hit —a statement that is certainly logical.
There was a distressing monotony about the first
10 rounds, which were a succession ef races round
the enclosure —Lees being usually a little in front.
He had evidently been told to keep off his man.
This was sound advice. With such a man as
Jackson in the ring we would do more than keep
off him —we would keep off the stage altogether.
Up to the 6th round the men had only worked off
about threepen’orth of the entrance money in
bashing, and the seatholders began to become dis-
contented ; they had paid a pound a head, and
nothing less than gore could be accepted as the
quo pro quid. Therefore the voice of their
united complainings was like unto a ton of
hailstones on a tin roof, and it was in
vain that Mr. Foley occasionally remarked ;
“ Genelmen, we ’ave eome to see a fight,” &c. One
obstreperous individual was asked by Larry to go
outside, and he at once obeyed. Mr. Foley’s advice
always has strong persuasive power. In the
7th round things perceptibly improved ; there was
not even then much hitting done, and would have
been less if Lees could have run a little faster.
The work, so far, was evenly divided : Jackson
did all the hitting and Lees all the receiving. For
particulars as to the way in which Lees tried his
left and nabbed a heavy return on the conk, after
getting much workmanlike punishment on the
mark and breadbasket, see the S.M. Herald of
Monday. In the 11th round Lees’ left went on a
foreign mission to the heathen with gratifying
results, but in the following round he accepted
board and temporary lodging at the instigation
of Mr. Jackson. From this out Tommy’s imports
largely exceed his exports ; the balance of ex-
changes set strongly against him, in spite of his
attempts to maintain a system of protection. The
money’s worth mounted up quickly during the 20th
round, at least 10 shillings’ worth of bashing
being done then. The Echo lucidly describes the
way in which Jackson landed Lee* on the smeller
and potato-trap at this stage, receiving light re-
turns on the conk and kisser. In response to some
exclamations during the 21st round Mr. Foley
came forward and was understood to say, “ Genel-
men, we ’ave,” &c., &c. Lees now began to get a
dim perception of the fact that Jackson owned a
remarkably enterprising left; but in spite of this
discovery, he fought hard and close, the only
result being that Jackson’s glove permanently
resided on the Melbourne man’s nose. From
round 25 Jackson, who was a waiter for oppor-
tunity, seemed to be fulfilling a permanent order
of hot coffee for one, and ten minutes of hard
slogging recompensed the audience for the balance
of their ticket outlay, for the bashing was very
heavy. In round 26 Mr. Foley introdueed a plea-
sant variation by orating as follows : “ Genelmen,
we ’ave,” &c., &c. In round 29 Jackson napped
Lees heavily on the conk, following this up with
visitations to his opponent’s bread-basket and
right peeper (vide E. News), and during the follow-
ing round Lees handed in his resignation.
Throughout he fought a plucky though hopeless
battle, and at the finish Jackson treated him with
the merciful consideration due to an honourably
beaten man. As soon as the result was posted,
Jackson was made the apex of a human pyramid,
and carried off in triumph. Tommy Leo* was also
well attended to by his friends, but disloyal mut-
terings were rife because, owing probably to some
oversight, Lord Carington’s carriage was not
placed at his disposal. At the conclusion of pro-
ceedings, Mr. Foley began an ©ration thus :
“ Genelmen, we ’ave ” —we left then as the words
seemed to be in some sense familiar. Larry has
50 different hits, but only one speech. We have
heard it —several times, or even more.
Monotone.

Do you think of the days that used to be,
Ah ! not so long ago ?
You used to say then that you loved but me ;
But you’re just like the winds that blow.
They have no reason, they have no sense,
And they just pass to and fro,
We know not whither, we know not whence ;
Your love is the same, I know.
The wind can be passionate in its might,
Or lazy, and soft, and low ;
You are just as passionate, just as light,
My love of a year ago.

“William Minogue, a labourer, was ar-
rested in the labour-yard at the Melbourne gaol,
which he had burglariously entered by a ladder
and rope.” The enterprise shown by our Vic-
torian brother recalls the “ good old times,” 10
years ago, when the conflnees of Darlinghurst

Woolloomooloo, and get back to prison before day-

lit
Is the life we live worth living, as we struggle
from day to day,
For the food we eat, and the clothes we wear,
and the coin to pay our way,
As we grind, and toil, and worry, amidst hoping,
and doubt, and fear,
That the drought, or the flood, or the cold, or heat
with success may interfere ?
We dare not stray from the narrow path, we fear
what the world will say,
Yot envy the while, in our secret soul, the man in
the beaten way.
We crawl to church (’tis the proper thing) and
devoutly kneel and pray
That the Lord will send just enough to keep the
meal-chest full to-day ;
On our homeward way, from the home of prayer,
we moan, if the way’s not clear,
To keep the chest and the cellar full till the end of
the coming year.
We tell of our trust in Providence, which marketh
the sparrow’s fall,
' And straightway show by our daily lives that we
trust Him not at all.
We sit ’neath the preacher, week by week, as he
tells us the oft-told tale,
’Tis loss to garner our treasure here, where the
rust and the moth prevail,
Where the cracksman comes, in the dead of night.
and “ jimmys” the Milner box,
And the lesser lights of the burglar’s art pick our
combination locks, —
And we think, as the well-worn platitudes fall soft
on the careless crowd,
’Twere a good idea (so our lives would say) to have
pockets built in our shroud.
As the preacher tells of the man of sin who bends
not the righteous knee,
We mentally mutter “That’s Smith,” “That’s
Jones,” hut never say once “ That’s me/”
He grindeth the poor, loves not the law, and he
hoardeth up the pelf ;
That character fits, like ’twas made for Brown,
but becometh not ourself.
Our debts forgive, as we gently deal with our
brother who owes us aught.
Mem : Issue a writ if Robinson fails to pay for the
goods he bought,
Oppress not the widow, the fatherless, that mes-
sage the Lord hath sent:
That was not oppression to 'sell her sticks, she
owed us a fortnight’s rent,
But a loan to the Lord is the rich man’s gift to his
brother the poorer man —
Do we give our cash for the poor man’s use ? Yes,
cent, per cent, per ann.
And the preacher speaketh in solemn tones, “ Re-
member the Sabbath Day,
Thou shalt not work, nor thy man nor maid, and
the horse and the ox may play.”
Just so, and the carriage the gate beside waits
our leaving the house of prayer
We go to pray, as our neighbours do, and our man
goes there to swear,
To curse and howl at the flies and sun, to break
through the mandates ten,
Till we drop in the plate a current coin, and echo
the priest’s “Amen”;
Pass out through the gate, with a smirk and a
bow for our brethren in the fold,
Then enter the carriage—“ Now, drive like ,
for our dinner’s getting cold.”
’Tis a sweetly-consistent life we live, let us roll
our eyes and rant,
For the preacher tells us we can be good—we can,
but, alas, we cant !

The A.J.O.’s Spring meeting was brought
to a moderately successful termination on Satur-
day last. The thorough success of the four days’
sport was, to a certain extent, marred by the un-
earthing of such a brilliant three-year-old as
Trident proved himself to he, but the hollow vie
tory of the Derby winner in all his contests was
atoned for-in some measure by the very close run
for the Metrop. With the almost exclusive ex-
ception of those who were made cognisant of the
Bohemian’s ability to stay two miles, very few
profited by the victory of the little brown horse,
and it may be remarked here that, although a
Sydney-bred animal, New South Welshmen would
not have him at any price, preferring to stand by
the Jewel and others, whose performances over a
two-mile course were of no more reliable nature
than were those of the Bohemian. The remain-
ing events were, as a rule, well contested. We
have known Mr. Scarr to be more successful in
framing his handicaps, or else it is that the public
are getting more clever than formerly at picking
winners, but true it is that directly the weights
were published for the Shorts’ Handicap, Squat-
ters’ Handicap, Sydney Handicap, and Free
Handicap, My Lord, Corday, Industry, and the
Agent were pounced upon, much to the disgust of
the fielders.
What a wonderful galloping machine
Trident must be. In the race for the Randwick
Plate of three miles he ran his first round, canter-
ing only, in 2min. 22seo. ; second round, in 2min.
1 Lsec. ; the last two miles in 3min. 36sec. ; and
his last mile in train. losec. At no part of the
journey was he ever extended, and it is beyond
all comprehension what he could or can do when
required. We hardly expect to see him measure
strides with Malua, Commotion, and Trenton this
spring at Melbourne, but should a meeting take
place between them, he may he trusted to put
them all down.

The Hon. J. White's string, men and horses,
left for Melbourne this week. The brigade con-
sists of Mr. M. Fennelly, Mr. Tom Paton, Master
Robert Ellis, a full detachment of captains, cor-
porals, and privates, together with Sumatra,
Pontifex, Aberdeen, Lava, Trident, Acme, Tama-
risk, Volcano, Monte Christo, Hexham, and
Bando, all of these, save the latter, having engage-
ments at the V.R.C. Spring meeting. With any-
thing like a smile from dame Fortune, Mr.
Fennelly will return well laden with the rich
plums provided by our friends in Victoria.
♦ * *
Rumours have been freely circulated dur-
ing the week past that a syndicate of book-
makers had offered Mr. White the sum of
£5OO0 —some papers have it £lO 000 —for the
colt Trident. Like many other reports that have
been circulated about the same stable when in
possession of a Derby favourite, this report is
quite unfounded ; and for the benefit of those who
have backed Trident for any future engagements,
we may state, on the authority of Mr. Fennelly,
that there is not an individual (male or female) at
present waltzing around this terrestial globe with
sufficient coin to purchase one hair of the tail of
the great son of Robinson Crusoe and Cocoanut.
* * *
Young Bob Ellis, third lieutenant in the
Hon. James White’s racing establishment, was
the hero of the occasion on the third day of the
A.J.C. Spring meeting, his record showing three
wins and two seconds. It is worthy of notice that
the masher jockey was associated with the gentler
sex in each performance, his respective mounts
being on Kathleen, Acme, Cora Lee, and Industry.
* * *
In direct opposition to the consensus of
opinion which appears to exist in the minds of the
great majority of Sydney sporting scribes respect-
ing the condition of the running track at Rand wick,
we embrace this opportunity of stating that a more
disgraceful rink for a leading racing club to possess
is not on record. Hard as marble, and almost as
bare, it is a wonder indeed that a bigger list of
cripples has not to be chronicled. Should Mr.
Clibborn visit Flemington this year it will do him
no harm to interview Jonathan Brown, the ranger,
always providing he is willing to accept any sug-
gestions that may be offered. But we are without
any hopes of such a consummation eventuating.
Surely some consideration is due owners and
trainers, who contribute in no small degree to the
present position enjoyed by the A.J.C.
We were disappointed on learning that
Brown and Rose was scratched for the Waverley
Handicap, because we were anxious that Mr.
Austin (if he were present) should have had living
proof that his arguments on two-year-old racing
are without foundation. Brown and Bose com-
menced her racing career early in August as a
two-year-old, and has been running ever since. It
only requires one glance at her to convince the
most critical judge that she is as sound now as the
day she was foaled.
* ♦ *
We are afraid the powers that be, in con-
nection with the V.R.C., will not arrive at any
satisfactory arrangements on the two-year-old
racing question. The V.R.C., in introducing
penalties into their Maribyrnong Plate this year,
have taken a step that will prove a stumbling
block in the future. Far wiser would it have
been to carry the event on to the Autumn meeting
and make it exclusively for maiden two-year-olds.
By so doing every end would ho reached, the
trainers would have sufficient time to prepare
their charges without hurrying them, breeders
also would have the satisfaction of knowing that
their representatives were well-matured two-year-
olds, and last, but not least, the cruelty (which,
we contend, at present is indulged in) of asking
them to carry Bst. 101 h., and Bst. 51b. respectively
would be done away with.

“ Asmodeus,” of the Melbourne Leader,
is terribly cut up over the victory of The Bohemian
in the Metropolitan Stakes, his virtuous indigna-
tion inducing him to bewail the wickedness of
poor innocent Tom Jones in not supplying the
Leader with full particulars of The Bohemian’s
performances in private. A couple of weeks ago
a gushing paragraph appeared in the Age stating
that “Asmodeus,” of the Leader, had tipped
Meteor as the absolute winner of the Hawkesbury
Handicap, and attention was also drawn to the
fact that all the other scribes had failed to attain
this success. A very clever performance indeed,
“Asmodeus,” but we would like to call your at-
tention to Meteor’s running in the mile flat race
at the last Melbourne Hunt Club meeting. In
that event he carried 7st. 101 b., started a strong
favourite, and yet only finished third. We
are really anxious to know whether you, “ Asmo-
deus,” “reflected sadly” over that performance.
We are afraid you did not, and are sorry to think so,
because we cannot then acquit you of a want of
impartiality as a sporting writer. Had “Asmo-
deus” been fortunate enough to select “The
Bohemian ” for the Metrop., the few readers of his
matter would possibly have been spared the trouble
of perusing a paragraph seemingly meant to insinu-
ate that the horse has been purposely prevented
from doing his best to win during the last eight
months. Such innuendoes are despicable unless
based upon the very strongest suspicion, and it
will be remembered that it was a par. of this kind
by the same writer which once drew the Leader
into a libel action at the suit of Mr. E. De Mestre.

In the present issue appears an extended
list of commendatory opinions concerning “ Demo-
crat’s ” consultations. It will he seen that several
country papers have discovered that “ Democrat ”
is the soul of commercial honour. The power of
acquiring information which those provincial
papers possess is nothing loss than marvellous.

Still another athletic star for the Austra-

In the match Undaunted v. Newtown
Waratah last Saturday, for the Bowden Cup,
Sorrell, of the Undaunteds, took six wickets for 2
runs in the first innings, and 14 wickets for 15
runs in the two innings.

The championship race between Beach
and Wallace Ross resulted, as was expected, in
an easy win for Beach by four lengths, which he
apparently could have increased to anything he
liked. According to the cabled accounts, Beach
led all through, and Ross was “ never in it.” The
so-called cablegrams printed by the dailies are
huge masses of “padding” seasoned with but two
or three central facts. One of the most extra-
ordinary productions ever given to the world by
any paper is a “ cablegram ” printed in the
Sydney E. News of Monday. It is a column and
a quarter long and yet does not contain ten lines
which could not have been evolved from the
imagination of the genius who wrote it up.

Mr. Jewett, of the Messageries Maritime
Company, has now on its way here an American
centre-board yacht, 29ft. long by 12ft. beam. She
is credited with being considered a fast boat in
New York.

The boat-race versus morning prayer. We
were walking past a most fashionable Sydney
church about noon last Sunday when we were
hailed by a verger in full-flowing gown and regu-
larly sanctimonious appearance. “Hey ! can you
tell me who won the boat-race 2 ” quoth the
waiter at the doors of the Lord’s house. Astonish-
ment took our breath away for a minute, and no
answer could we give. We are afraid we re-
buked our inquisitive friend with the toga, hut
his further explanation : “ You see, sir, we hear
so many sermons that we are glad of anything for
a change,” worked up pity in our heart, and we
loved him before we left. He was so human-
even on a Sunday—and we told him no word had
come yet, and, furthermore, we only wish we
could have got the poor devil a drink. N.B.—
The Bishop was not preaching at that church.
* ♦
Anyone who wishes to see how meanly
the big Australian dailies behave to their readers
in the matter of cablegrams should carefully pre-
serve the alleged “cables” in re the Beach-
Gaudaur and Beach-Ross matches, and compare
same with the detailed accounts in the English
sporting papers when they come to hand.

On the Barcoo the other day, a very “ shy”
bookmaker laid 20 to 8 against a certain horse,
which won easily. When called upon to pay he repu-
diated the bet, and being asked to produce his book,
did so, hut a few leaves were torn out, which he
said had been out a long time. And still they
didn’t put him in the river.

A sweepstakes—to come off at Newmarket
next month—has been arranged between the
Bard, Melton, and Ormonde. Evidently the
cracks are to meet on handicap terms, for the
Duke of Westminster’s champion has already
smothered the other two at weight for age.

When “ our William ” rowed Teemer he
stopped to wave his hand to some friends. He
stopped twice during the race with Gaudaur, and
then his friends waved their hands at him.

After the dead heat between Tamarisk and
Crossfire for the Oaks, Mr. White agreed to divide
the stakes because Mr. Long’s filly showed symp-
toms of lameness. Humph! Such magnanimity
is phenomenal. It is like a boxer consenting to a
draw because his opponent couldn’t come up to
time.
* * *
If Beach has been backing his friend Kemp
and the other stable companions, he won’t return
so much richer than he started. It the case of
Trickett and Laycock, the second string won the
money which was dropped over the crack. This
time we had Beach winning the backers’ money
and the other fellows dribbling it away.
* * *
Before Beach gasped home in 22min. 29sec.,
the best time over the Thames champion course
was Tarryer’s—22min. 55sec. Considering that
Tarryer was a very small potato in the aquatic
world, it doesn’t look as though too much import-
ance should be attached to the time test. English
papers will give us fuller information on that
head.
Thadeus O’Kane.
Thadeus. O’Kane, of the Northern Miner,
Charters Towers (Q.), whose portrait appears in
this issue, is a plucky and hard-fighting Irishman,
whose name has become known far beyond his
own limited sphere. He was horn in 1820 at
Dingle, county Kerry, Ireland, and distinguished
tiimself at Maynooth, leaving that college in 1846,
The next five years he spent in London, after
which he started as a schoolmaster in his native
county and did his level best to teach the youth of
that district that there was something more in
this world than priests and “spuds.” He had a
short experience on the Tralee Chronicle, after
which he founded the Kerry Star, and threw
journalistic pearls before an animal frequently
mentioned in Scripture with so little effect that a
wind-up soon resulted. In 1863, he left for Aus-
tralia and worked in the North Australian at
Brisbane until that typographical wreck became
defunct, and having seen it decently “shoved
underground,” he proceeded to Rockhampton, the
City of Sin, Sweat, and Sorrow. Here ho put in
about seven years’ working on both the papers,
which vainly endeavoured to enlighten that dreary
dog-hole on the Fltzroy, and finally growing weary
of the flfth-iate journalism of that era, ho took to
mining, an occupation which ho followed for three
years with a great deal of vigour, but with no
success worth swearing by. Finally he drifted to
Charters Towers in 1873 and joined the Northern
Miner, of which paper he became proprietor six
months later. It was then a weekly, but after
passing through various stages it became an
evening daily in July, 1883. Mr. O’Kane has
since run the paper almost single-handed, and has
made things lively—or rather deadly—at the
Towers. He has an .uncompromising way of
hitting all public nuisances in the eye, and has
defended about 13 libel actions in consequence,
with another apparently looming in the distance.
Now and then he has caved and apologised—pro-
bably when the cupboard was very bare —but, as
a rule, when challenged he merely repeats the
original offence with aggravating circumstances
and tells the other man to wade in. He is now 66
years of age, and is engaged flinging his sft. 6 ; |in.
of fighting manhood on the obnoxious Chinaman
against whom he has declared war to the bitter
end. As yet the Ohinkies only smile with bland
complacency at his attacks, but he means dire
mischief, and we wish him every success in his
crusade.
“The Crimes of Paris,” with Mr. Philip
Beck as leading crimester (new word—patented),
is the present bill at Melbourne Royal. This sen
sational six-act synthesis of sin, sorrow, and
sudden death scored a certain sort of success in
Sydney six months since. It is doing as much in
Melbourne. Nevertheless, the Triumvirate kept
strictly within the confines of truth when they
advertised this dramatic nightmare as “ the
greatest combination of rubbish over seen within
the walls of a theatre.” The announcement was
made in scornful defiance of a condemning press.
In the same spirit of sturdy independence the firm
published such criticisms as, “the drama is fitted
for a penny gaff in Whitechapel.’ This policy of
crying “ stinking fish” in a sarcastic tone of voice
may be smart, provided the fish doesn’t stink.
But we don’t fancy it has attracted customers in
the present instance.
The production of “ As You Like It” at
the Melbourne Bijou was interesting to Shakes-
perian students. Some new light was thrown
upon that always beautiful comedy. They saw
for the first time the master’s real purpose. The
characters of Rosalind, Orlando, Touchstone,
and others were written in order to give com-
pleteness to the wrestling scene. “As You Like
It,” in short, was originally intended to be a
Graeco-Roman WTOstling entertainment. The
truth dawned upon us when we found that Pro-
fessor Miller and Mons. Victor had been specially
engaged, and were the very marrow of the whole
show. Victor was not on the programme, but
Professor Miller, it seems, has played Charles in
America. He is immense in the part. The way
in which he threw Victor, after a 20 minutes’
bout, was poetical to a degree. Then his struggle
with Orlando ! Words cannot describe the Pro-
fessor’s rendering of this passage. At the very
moment when he might have been expected to
chuck Orlando into the dress circle, the gladiator
collapsed to slow music. As an elocutionist Pro-
fessor Miller has a style of his own. He ad-
dresses his feet and emphasises his conjunctions.
Nevertheless, take it for all in all, his “ Charles
the Wrestler ”is a well-thought out piece of
work. The Professor had a great reception from
the gallery, and the rest of the company were
fairly good in their respective parts. One word
before we go. We would remind theatrical
managers that a wealth of “ variety ” business
might be introduced into “ Hamlet.” Four acts
might be cut out, and the play-scene strengthened
with sword-swallowing and a half-mile walking
contest. We can offer suggestions which have
only to be adopted to make Shakespeare knock
opera bouffe silly.
A boy who had been put into the train at
Gundagai and sent down to Sydney in order that
he might join his father called at a Sydney police
station and said he could not find his “ governor, ’
whose “ direction,” he had been told, was “ G. A.
Woodland, Printer, G.P.0., Sydney.” “ Natur-
ally,” says the D.T., “with no better direction
than this he wandered about in the city unable to
find a trace of his father. The police will be glad
to hear from anyone related to the boy.” One can
understand a policeman’s ignorance, but what
about the wooden-headedness of the newspaper
people who didn’t know that a printer could be
found at the Govt. Printing Office ?

It was evidently a kindly desire to pre-
vent Sydney people from gasping under a sudden
dramatic shock, which induced Mr. W. J. Hollo-
way to play the “ Ring of Iron ”at the Opera
House before putting on “ Romeo and Juliet.”
We are glad to have a lot of nice things to say
about this latter show. It has been put on abso-
lutely regardless of financial limitations ; the
scenery is gorgeous, the dresses magnificent, and
the staging in keeping with the other appoint-
ments. With a strong cast and good acting the
play would leave nothing whatever to be desired.

Miss Essie Jenyns has large advantages in her
contest with the role of the ill-fated heroine. Her
natural gifts are immense. Her beauty is suffi-
cient to account for all the love-lorn lunacies of a
iozen Romeos, and her figure is just built in the
pvay most convenient for one who wishes to fall
lown gracefully. And Miss Jenyns uses her
lowers with economy ; her genius is spread over
is big an area as it can be made to cover. Natur-
dly, therefore, she makes a big success, which is
mly derogated from by a marked straining after
ttect. Mr. Holloway’s Romeo can hardly be
minted a perfect success ; his art is always on
tilts, his emotion usually padded and inflated, his
etion spasmodic, and his attitudes unreal. In the
alcony scene he is perhaps at his worst. It was
emarked by a lady of one Romeo that if he had
a talked to her on a balcony she would have
3uio down to him ; if addressed by Mr. W. J.
tolloway in the same part she would probably
ave contented herself by sending down a boot
ick. In later scenes Romeo managed to forget
ia audience to some extent, but his performance
i not likely to become historic—in the way ho
ould like it to be, anyhow. Mr. Charles Holloway
d not make a boundless success of Friar
lurenco, for he is a decided victim to the
ndemic staginess which, in a greater or less
igree, infected the entire company. Mcrcufo
r. Richard Stewart, was not equal to some ex-
ments of the character whom we have seen ; and
fbalt filled a long-felt want in killing him out of
e play. If the death of Mercutio could be
ought off in future performances before the
rtain rises, , we think it would add to the general
joyment. Lady Capulet managed her business
tisfactorily, a compliment that cannot be credited
Miss Kate Arden, whose personation of the
irse was as rugged as the devious ways of a
iminent politician. Of the other characters we
II not speak, for our bump of benevolence is in

“ Two Too Many,” at Sydney Gaiety, is a
nedy which every citizen should see before he
s—as shortly before as possible. It is the story
two young men, each possessed of a wealthy
fie, one being the nephew of an agricultural
son who says he must not marry, and the
er related to a Dutchman who wants him to
e a wife instantly. The first is, of course, en-
:ed, his betrothed being the daughter of two
atics, and on the day before his wedding he is
y trying to smooth matters with a previous
icb when a hideously insane cackle outside the
r announces his future father-in-law. In this
mma he passes the lady off as his friend’s wife
in that capacity she is introduced to a damp
weeping old woman and invited to the wed-
>• Next the clodhopping uncle turns up sud-
ly, and the nephew finds it necessary to pass
his bride also as his friend’s property, and a
ch roar outside the door heralds the other
i’s relative, whose arrival is equally unex-
ed. He is accompanied, by a fresh-caught
sel named Snichenhulznehozen whom he
rs his unhappy nephew to marry at once, and
bewildered wretch only escapes for the
lent by asserting that he is already wedded to
andlady’s daughter. By this device he finds
elf saddled with three wives in all, and his
ry is completed when the father-in-law again
les in and smilingly invites both uncles
or Three wives to attend the cere-
.. Linder these saddening circumstances it is
isary to have recourse to stratagem. One un-
-1 sent on a false scent to a church five miles
nt, the other has a dose of laudanum

and obstreperous of the three wives. With
precautions the marriage passes off quietly,
ftei the ceremony, just as a short-trousered
with ankles that might sustain a prize ox, is
ivouring to console a lady who is literally
d with tears, there is a vengeful inrush. The
is filled with wives and dried-up uncles and

less of resource is most needed, the bride-

Romeo and Juliet” was played for the
second time at the Sydney Standard to an audience
of largo, if not absolutely colossal, proportions.
Miss Dampier improved considerably on her first
conception of Juliet, and gave an eminently grati-
ying version of the part. Her range of art hardly
reaches the top notes of Shakespeare’s work, but
her ardour and simplicity in love were such as to
induce the casual observer to believe that Miss
Dampier is, or has been, in love. The casual ob-
server is right, else have we nightly attended the
Standard for many weeks in vain. Miss Dampier’s
Juliet is natural throughout: her love, her tremor
her raptures, are real; it is only her despair which
shows signs of adulteration. Romeo was a careful
but the signs of study were just a trifle too
abundant. Mercutio was so genuine and rollick-
ing a fellow as to make his too early decease a
matter for general regret; and the nurse, Miss
Juba Merton, was about as good as they make
em.

In Adelaide the prevailing rush of hypo-
crisy to tho head has infected evcfci the pugilists,
wife-beaters, and hoodlums, and now the prowl-
ing midnight ruffian remarks that “ the ungodly
shall not stand ” as he “ jobs” his victim in the eye,
and tho latter, lying on his back in the gutter,
hears the tail-end of something about regeneration
by faith as a pair of cow-hide boots and his gold
watch disappear round the corner. A week ago
a loving oouple faced each other in an Adelaide
baak street, the male brute armed with a knobby
stick, the female with a bottle, and each expressed
a burning desire for the other ‘ blaggard to
come on. Then a policeman hove round the
corner, and as he did so the pair threw themselves
into each other's arms, the fond wife sobbing ;
“ Oh 1 John, don’t leave me and go away in that
horrid steamer—don’t, I implore you, for my sake
and the sake of the little ones to which
the pillar of the household responded in broken ac-
cents : “ Mary, I must go, love ; I can’t get work
here, and I must earn some bread for you and the
little ones.” At this moment the policeman iin-
liov© himself round the next corner. M.ary, with
her head resting on her husband’s shoulder, was
tho first to note his disappearance, and in another
instant the bottle concussed on John’s head and
flew into fragments. Then John gave the load
clinging creature a “wonner” with his fist that
made her double up and howl again, and as she
doubled up he hit her all down the hack with his
club, while tho falling Mary grabbed at his legs as
she went down and tilted him into the gutter.
Another officer then loomed in the distance, and
John carried his darling in, her arms round his
neck the while, and whopped her till she could
hardly move in the seclusion of their ’umble ’ome.

Want —a want which dates back to the creation of

the addressee of respectable young women who
are willing to communicate with settlers in the

desirous of meeting with useful wives. Appli-
cants should state their particular requirements
and preferences, enclosing postal order for 2s, to
meet preliminary exposes. For the special in-
formation of sighing selectors in the back blocks,
where the foot of the white woman seldom treads,
we may mention that Messrs. Jensen and Cos. are
just opening up a choice assortment of summer

“ The portraits of the Georges are to be

Judge Holroyd, of Victoria, may not be
actually nasty, but he is confoundedly particular,
the other day, when a lady asserted on her solemn
iudicial swear that she was born in a certain plac«>.
he demanded indignantly how she could make,
such a declaration when she had only been i r a .
formed of th® fa*t, &nd the flabbergasted witn ess
could not collect hdr henses in time to retort, that
she was there and ought to know. This, is the
kind of bothering official who thinks that he wakes
in (the morning and, rising from his alleged bed
puts what he has been told are his clothes on to
what he solemnly believes to bo his body. In his
judicial capacity he now and then passes what ho
means to be a sentence of 10 years on a hideous
object which he fancies is the prisoner, but perhaps
in his uncertainty he may some day make a mis-
take and pass sentence on the jury instead. It is
hard to tell where Judge Holroyd’s passion for ac-
curacy may not land him some of these days.

Rev. Jefferis, having talked clean off Aus-
tralian soil most other sorts of wickedness, last
Sunday attacked gambling. Our holy friend is
quite right in denouncing this practice, especially
as ho is able to add the force of his example to the
weight of ins anathemas. A man is a fool to
gamble it he has anything to lose. The clergyman
who, like Rev. Jefferis, has a snug and certain
£IOOO a year, would be a fool if lie played half-
crown Nap all night with a pressman that worked
the business on the 1.0. U. principle. The clergy
are quite right in confining their gambling opera-
tions to the safe land specs, into which they are put
by pious auctioneers.

A little story of what may happen to a man
in Australia—a romantic, touching, hungry yarn.
Last year Genevieve Ward performed a dreary
Greek play at the Melbourne Town Hall to a £OOOO
“house.” Tho money was to be devoted to the
building of anew wing to what was then called
the Lying-in Hospital. At the particular request
of “ sassiety” the name of this institution was al-
tered to tho “ Women’s Hospital,” cither because
the old appellation made “ sassiety” blush, or else
because men came knocking at the door thinking
that they could lie in. But no matter. Plans were
invited for the Genevieve Ward wing, and the
hospital committee offered a £IOO prize for tho best
design. The drawings were submitted anony-
mously, and after many deliberations and much
sherry and biscuits, the “ century” was awarded
to an unknown competing under the nom dc plume
of “Isolation.” The committee’s decision was
tardily announced, but nobody called for tho little
cheque. “Isolation,” apparently, lived outside
tho pale of humanity, and never road newspapers.
Enquiries were made, and it was discovered that
“Isolation” was a Mr. Snell, and that Mr. Snell
was a dead ’un. Yes, dear friends. Two days
before the bit of luck fell due, the poor devil—
hard-up and hungry—had suicided. While the
committee were stroking their paunches and dilly-
dallying with the plans, hope deferred was turning
“ Isolation’s” brain. Snell —son of the famous
London architect—was always an eccentric, ex-
citable fellow. It was his misfortune to be a
genius, with a genius’s inability to make money.
He was wont to boast that “ God had made him
an architect.” Let us hope he is now busy with
some inspired plans for his own mansion in the
skies. Poor Isolation Snell !

The London Law Journal thus antici-
pates the passing of that everlasting Deceased
Wife’s Sister Bill“ Two brothers marry two
sisters, and one brother and one sister die under
the ordeal. The surviving widower can marry
the surviving widow because she is his deceased
wife’s sister. So far so good. But the Bill doesn t
allow a widow to marry the dear departed’s
brother.” See that now. Under such conditions
it will be possible for a widow to be her own
brother-in-law’s wife.”

The Christian Colonist (Adelaide) asks ;
“ Can a good man with a cigar in his mouth talk
effectively to a boy with a cigarette in his
mouth I ” We think it depends greatly on the
good man’g cheek and the size of the boy, but we
would like to know also if a clergyman with a
hiccup, a hat like an accordeon, a black eye, and
breath that ought to pay a duty of ss. per gallon,
can talk religiously to an elder with a broken
nose and a pawn-ticket. We have seen this done,
and we think one job is about as hard as the other.

Since George Augustus Sala, in a dyspeptic
moment, stigmatised the Yorick Clubists as a
“gang of cads,” Melbourne journalism has, meta-
phorically speaking, sat upon Augustus and all his
works. Truth to tell, the old hand has lost a
little of its cunning in these latter days, but we
can’t allow the plump “special” to be slandered
by the Aon. A moribund lion must be protected
from the imbecile onslaughts of a live donkey. To
explain. It seems that Sala recently wrote that
Edgar Allen Poe would never have made “ dis-
tant Aden” rhyme with “ sainted maiden if he
had set foot on the place. G.A.S. omitted to add
a footnote explaining that this was meant for
“ sarkusm.” The average reader can understand
these little jokes without the assistance of a key.
But an Age genius, in all vindictive solemnity,
holds up to ridicule this “singular literary blun-
der.” The erudite simpleton tells us that Sala is
“ confounding Aden, the British Fort and coaling-
station, with the Hindustanee word Aidenn,
meaning Paradise.” Intoxicated by the discovery
of this mare’s-nest, the Age goes on to drivel that
“ the blunder exemplefles the mischief of quoting
from memory in more ways than one, for the
actual rhyme in the poem is not ‘ sainted maiden,
but ‘ sorrow laden,’ the words quoted occurring
in the following line.” Great Scott! This comes
of letting the wretch read poetry. There are two
“ actual rhymes ” to Aidenn :
“ Tell this soul, with sorrow laden, if within the
distant Aidenn
It shall clasp a'sainted maiden whom the angels
name Lenore.”
Zounds ! Odds Bodds ! And he thinks that Sala
imagines that Poe dreamed of cuddling his girl on
a coaling-station !! But we can write no more.
Better one bloody deed than a continuance of
these horrible Age atrocities. Buy us a return
ticket to Melbourne and a good, big, blunt meat-
axe. We’ll bring the monster back, stuffed.
To Tradesmen, Farmers, and Others.
Take heart, ye young men who are single,
And sigh for a suitable mate —
Whose life with your life will commingle
In the blessed connubial state ;
Take heart, ye young tradesmen and farmers,
Straight away to the post-offlce go,
And place orders for feminine charmers
With Jensen and Co.
Oh ! a blessing and boon to our sex is
This Arm ; you have merely to write
(While enclosing two shillings for exes..)
And wait for the promised delight;
You mention the sort which you fancy—
Face, figure, and size, so and so —
Then they find you a likely fiancee,
Do Jensen and Co.
Plump and petite, or lanky and bony—
Dark, fair, ruddy-tinted, or pale—
Old-fashioned, or dashing and “ tony
The firm have all classes on sale ;
They are always in stock, well-assorted,
And anxious and willing for beaux —
Just waiting their turns to be courted
Through Jensen and Co.
Ah, the joy of engaging a missis
Who whispers, on paper, her “ yes” !
To receive, through the post, her first kisses,
And feel her warm written caress !
If you really mean biz. (bona fide)
Bid adieu to all bachelor woe —
Get a girl, guaranteed clean and tidy,
From Jensen and Co.
But when you’ve imported the darling,
And made her your own little wife.
Pray avoid idle snapping and snarling—
Steer clear of coniugal strife ;
For a Hades on earth can be hotter
Than the home which awaits us below —
So be warned and don’t say when you’ve got her,
“ d n Jensen and Co. ! ”
Adieu, then, ye German quartette—
Go, hide your gross sensual faces :
Your absence will no one regret
When better men hang in your places ;
Things of an evil old past,
Distinguished for nought hut your orgies—
Ye never w£te properly classed
Till Thackeray wrote “ The Four Georges.”
Divil a tear will we shed
O’er ever a one of your number—
We’ll murmur “ good riddance ” instead
To such a collection of lumber ;
Good bye ! Tra-la-la ! Get away !
A grocer who guzzles and gorges
Is better than ye, anyday—
Four gorgers shall oust the four Georges.
Connubial Complications,
I Tom and Will, twin brothers, courted Jess and
Jane —twin sisters they ;
Will and Tommy popped the question both toge-
ther on one day,
Jane and Jessie blushed and simpered, hanging
each her little head ;
Gaily rang the village church bells when the
ardent four were wed.
Onward went the years a-rolling (Father Time
stands never still)
Tom was stricken down with fever, so was .lane
(who married Will).
Jane and Thomas went to Heaven, went to join
the angel band—
Willie, out of love for Jenny, offered her his heart
and hand.
“ You are my deceased wife’s sister, and the
match is legal quite,”
Murmured Will in accents tender ; Jessie s
widowed cheek turned white —
“ You are my poor husband's brother" —Willie
looked uncommon blue —
Though you marry me, remember, I can never
marry you."
Willie scratched his head in wonder, sat reflecting
for a while ;
Presently his face was brightened by the sem-
blance of a smile—
“ Lot not, Jess, a legal blunder cast a shadow
o’er your life.
I shall be just like a husband if I wed you as my
wife.”
Gaily rang the village church bells, as they rang
in other years ;
Will and Jessie walked together down this weary
vale of tears,
They were treated by the parson on a pre-arranged
plan—
Willie merely “ took this woman,” Jessie never
“ took this man.”

Mr. Henson, M.L.A., who has just re-
turned from Wagga, says that he finds the people
there thoroughly alive to the benefits of local
option. So they ought to be. When a Wagga
man decides to go on a “ tear ” he has the option
of choosing any one of the 46 local pubs, for his
enjoyment. A visitor can only commit one un-
pardonable sin in Wagga—that sin is to go to bed
sober, thus insulting Wagga liquor, despising
Wagga hospitality, and outraging Wagga custom.
There is so much latent humour in Mr. Henson’s re-
mark that we would like to hear him on some
other important subject, such, for instance as the
“ Marriage Bond, its Uses and Advantages,” cr
the “ Moral tendencies and comforts of Mormon-

England that we wish to get rid of our Tory
Governors and elect our own ; that it is the desire
of Australia to disown “ distinguished colonists; ” '
and that we wish to start business on our own i

this he would make a second George Wash, off

“ C. A. Maxwell,” is permitted to say iiu

stick to plain English, and by shrewdness, tact,

“Colonel” Holborow, last week m the
N.S.W. Assembly, astonished iiiembcrsin »
by moving the adjournment ;l t ive ly
making a long speech. He wa t 0 t hc
eloquent, a fact that is clear!} a personal
j circumstance that it was his own i


grievance which in his estimation required ven-
tilating. The pretext of the oration was the con-
ferring of the rank of Major upon Mr. Wright,
of alleged railway fraud fame, without examina-
tion, but the real trouble seemed to be that Major
Wright was supposed to have designs upon the
pleasant and lucrative billet now held by Volunteer
Colonel Holborow, M.P. The Parliamentary de-
liverances of this latter worthy would be interest-
ing reading for his constituents. The last that
we remember was evoked by the fact that he had
not been selected for service with the Soudan
banditti, and wc also have a shadowy recollection
of another oration delivered some years ago when
increase of pay to certain volunteer officers was
proposed. But Mr. Holborow managed to work
in another grievance to support his own. It was
based on the fact that two officers had been
“plucked” at examination; this was probably
owing, the orator remarked, to the fact that they
were teetotallers and non-smokers. Possibly. In
the same way the repeated election of Col. Hol-
borow is probably owing to the fact that there are
Orangemen in Argyle, and that some of his con-
stituents hunger for railway billets.
What an eloquent sermon upon the ad-
vantages of Land Nationalisation might be
preached from the text of a memorandum which
Duncan Gillies recently submitted to the Victorian
Assembly ! In that memorandum the Commis-
sioners of Railways point out the difference be-
tween the estimated cost of certain new lines, and
the actual amount of “ sugar” disbursed over the
job. Set forth in round figures each mile of the
250 miles of lino to be laid down will cost £6OOO
more than was originally represented on the esti-
mates. That the Government surveyors displayed
the proverbial official ignorance in, reckoning the
cost of construction, is likely enough. Earth-
works, bridges, and culverts are awful mysteries
which can only be unravelled —at enormous ex-
pense—by railway contractors. We pass that part
of the business. But with land sales in the Mel-
bourne suburbs every Saturday through the year,
one might reasonably expect oven a Government
surveyor to fix the approximate land cost of 200
yards of line in the neighbourhood of Eitzroy.
The estimated value of this little tract of soil was
£l5OO. The price paid was £62,718! Possibly
that odd £58,000 represented a genuine “rise.”
Possibly it didn’t. Anyway the iniquitous folly of
any Government parting with the property of the
people, only to subsequently redeem it on such
runious terms is apparent to the bluest Tory.
£58,000 of unearned increment handed over to a
clique of land speculators, for the privilege of
constructing a furlong of railway !
Mr. Speight, Chief Commissioner of Vic-
torian Railways, has need of an equable temper
and a tough hide. Since he came out from “home ”
three years ago —to sweep away the accumulated
evils of a political patronage system, and to pro-
vide for a reduction in “ accidents”—Mr. Speight
has been a dignified target for the shafts of dis-
comfited jobbery. For a while, that section of the
Victorian press which greases the rising genera-
tion with buttery gush about “native talent,”
treated the new arrival rather scurvily. His works
have proved him, and Mr. Speight has lived down
journalistic jealousy, but political foes continue to
fire away at him with the fury of despair. Such
statesmen of the past as Colonel Smith and the ir-
repressible “ Tommy Bent,” keep steadily on the
Commissioner’s track, and amuse themselves with
“ pot” shots. A few days ago, the Engine-drivers
and Firemen’s Association held its annual spread,
and Mr. Speight attended under the impression
1 hat he was to assist at a convivial gathering. He
found himself caught in a trap. His loud-mouthed
critics had been invited —or had invited themselves
—to meet him and have another “go.” There was
Avine flowing, and the tongue of the scoffer became
unloosed. Mr. Bent commiserated the engine-
drivers and firemen upon their loss of political
“rights.” Mr. Collard Smith deprecated the ap-
pointment of an English manager, and sighed for
the good old days of muddle, locomotive collisions,
and no profits—the good old days .when every
greaser and stoker had his own representative in
the House and could rivet the attention of the
■country upon his “ case” if he happened to be sus-
pended for drunkenness. And worst of all, Mr.
•Gaunson had the bad taste to tell the men that
they ought to enjoy the option of appeal against
the Commissioners’ decisions, and AVent out of
Ms way to make an insulting reference to the
salary of his fellow guest. Mr. Speight calmly
listened to all this, and then got upon his legs to
put the matter in its non-political aspect. He
reminded the worthy engine-drivers that the rail-
ways should be regarded as a business speculation
of the colony, which had nothing to do with poli-
tics. As Commissioner, he was managing for the
firm, had showed a good profit last year, and in-
tended to show a much better one this. It wasn’t
his fault that he had been born in England and
solicited to come out to Victoria. If people were
to continue throwing firebrands into the service it
would be impossible for the business to be carried
on in a business-like way. That was the gist of
Mr. Speight’s practical oration. Presuming the
engine-driA'ers are sensible, they Avill take it to
heart and forget that they enjoy the unenviable
distinction of being Civil servants. The fact that
their appointed head is kept outside of politics is
the best guarantee that they Avill be squarely dealt
Avith. The “ right of appeal,” which Mr. Gaunson
advocates, is clamoured for by the insubordinate,
and not by the Avorkers. If Mr. Speight can’t be
trusted to adjudicate upon the question of a
porter’s competency or sobriety, what the dickens
Avas the use of importing him? Victoria has
secured a really good man—the best available —in
Speight. That’s Avhy some of them Avant to bind
him, hand and foot, Avith red tape.
The spirit of utter huvlessness which is
getiing a firm grip on the population of N.S.W.
«s is seen every day by the Felice court reports,
is simply appalling. Instead of progressing, the
Colony is retrograding fast. Murders, robberies,
and assaults (Avithout taking into account Parlia-
mentary pugilism) have been particularly com-
mon of late, but the action of a Deniliquin des-
perado named Simpson, caps all, and entirely
throws into the shade all other deeds of violence
yet recorded. This fiend, for he is not entitled to
be called by any other name, the other week, in
the full light of the noonday sun, entered the
kitchen garden of one Slopqr, and looted the said
plantation of turnips to the value (as the prosecu-
tor swore in Court) of threepence. To the credit
of the local constabulary it must be said that they
lost no time in running down and capturing this
abandoned buccaneer of depraved appetite. He
was brought before the Bench, but the local
paper a aguely tells us that “the case was dis-
missed.” Dismissed ! great hcaA-ens, and in the
name of outraged justice, we ask on what
grounds 2 A fiend to loot a man of three pen’orth
o’ turnips, and when brought to the judgment
seat where he should have been sentenced lo con-
dign punishment—flogging, to wit—to be calmly
told that he is discharged ! The whole thing is
monstrous. As avc said before New South Wales
is retrograding.
PERSONAL ITEMS.
Sir Charles Dilke is a godson of the Queen,
who is said to be horrified at the disclosures of his
wickedness.
Mr. E. B. Fairfax, of the S.M. Herald,
who was summoned from Europe owing to the
death of Mr. Hugh George, arrived last week by
the Carthage.
“The Pope is in a state of extreme
debility.” It is fortunate that L. L. Smith is just
now in Europe. Leo, young man, you don’t feel
well. “ Look into thy heart and write.”
Gen. Grant’s daughter, Nellie, is “ com-
pelled to leave her husband and come to her
mother on account of his neglect, abuse, drunken
carousals, and orgies with fast women.”
The Rev. Alexander Dowie lately told a
meeting of the elect that the day might come
when he would run a paper of his own. “ Then
there’ll bo a ruction,” said Dowie. Likely enough.
The gaol gave Peter Campbell a temporary
judicial separation ; a locomotive has now given
him an eternal divorce. On Sunday last Peter
was killed, as has been many another Stray sheep,
through getting in the way of a railway engine on
the St. Kilda (Melb.) line.'
At the Crawford-Dilke divorce trial it
transpired that though Mrs. Ashton Dilke know
that Dilke had been the “lover” of both her
mother and her sister she nevertheless left her
card at his residence after his second marriage !
We wonder if there were worse things in old
Rome ?
It was lately cabled that Frederick Harri-
son, the Positivist, was about to visit Australia
for his health. Mr. Harrison now threatens
Truth with libel for having promulgated the
statement on which the “cable” was founded.
Harrison’s pet boast, we remember reading in
Vanity Fair, is that he “has never been ill in
his life.” Such being the case, he does well to
avoid the hash-foundries of the Land of the
Kangaroo,
THADEUS O’KANE,
Editor of the NORTHERN MINER.
Whan Thadets O’Kane, of the NoifTHERN
Miner, wishes t® properly insult a man he simply
charges him witk having written a leader in the

that the man who contributes to his despised rival
has reached the lowest conceivable depth of
degradation.
The will of Sir Alexander Stuart, formerly
'N.S.W. Premier, has been proved at £83,517. Of
this amount near! r four-fifths will be absorbed by
■encumbrances and liabilities, but several of the
assets may realise much more than their present
valuation. Lady Stuart is sole devisee, and Mr.
Hobison, of Queensland, sole executor.
In view of the .approaching execution of
lleynolds, the Newtown (Sydney) murderer, who
compelled his wife to drink poison, our evening
contemporaries are devoting half-columns of space
to the N.S.W. hangman. This noseless horror
has now for his assistant a man who used to be
dog-catcher to the police, and who bears the some-
how singularly appropriate and suggestive name of
Suape.
It was rumoured in Melbourne that David
Henry—the astute financier who advances money
to the widow and the fatherless for a considera-
tion —had bolted to the Far West, •leaving a
£50,000 deficiency behind him. That was bad.
Anon it was anaiounoed that David Henry, Esq.,
had merely gone to America on a, pleasure trip, or
a mission of charity, and would opeedily return to
the scone of his, former triumphs. That was worse.
How David will flourish libel writs if ho ever does
come back!
Gladstone.,, it is alleged, was lately in his
grounds at Ilawarden endea vouring to walk off
worry, when., he noticed that he was closely fol-
lowed by t.wo loudly-dressed, bumptious-looking
individuals. Annoyed at the intrusion, he turned
to escape in an opposite diiec ion, but his perse-
cutors were too quick, and catching up to him the
first fiend said, “ Excuse me, hut are you not Mr.
Gladstone?” The G.O.M. admitted he was, and
the fiend continued, “Ah ! wo thought so. We
are from Australia—we are ’representative Aus-
tralians.” “Ah! I thought ,so,” replied the ex-
Premier, making tracks.
The “Escaped Nun,” now travelling in
N.S W., asserts that when the cholera broke out
in Jersey City in ’66 she was the only nun, escaped,
shut up, or otherwise who offered to tend the sick.
Next we expect to hear that she and a certain
male imitator of hers are the only two real
copper-tipped Christians existing, but that
the mail aforesaid, having lost the Church
funds bucking against a faro bank, has fallen
from grace, so that the Nun is on the sacred
wallaby—alone.
Louis Wein (once of Sydney, now of
North Queensland) sly-grog informer, nearly came
to a sudden end the other day. Li Hung was sell-
ing without a license, and Wein seized some 110
cases of grog in his stores. Looking up he spied
some gin-cases in a loft, and ordered John to
ascend, he himself following carelessly up the
ladder. John saw his chance, so seizing a case of
gin ho lifted it, and deliberately dashed it down
upon Mr. Wein’s caput, sending him down the
ladder a crushed and bleeding lump of mutilated
detective.
It was Ctesar who said that had he his choice
of a death he would choose that which would come
the swiftest. He got his wish. Frank Mitchell, a
Ballarat speculator, aged 59, seems to have thought
with Ceesar. Embarrassed through an outlay in
shaft-sinking, ho went to the shaft’s mouth a few
days ago, lifted the cover, and plunged head-fore-
most down eight hundred feet. The bearers fixed
at 300 ft. down stopped him, crushing him to a
senseless mass, and tearing his head from the
body. The Press telegrams add he was killed, and
for the first time we are inclined to believe them.
It was extensively rumoured years ago
that some near or distant connections of Sir Alfred
Stephen, ex-Chicf Justice and now Lieut.-Gover-
nor of N.S.W., wore reflected upon in the cele-
brated diary kept by and found in the possession
of the murderer Bertrand. Judging from the
fact that Sir Alfred—before whom, by the way,
that cold-blooded and infamous criminal was tried
—is now publicly opposing Bertrand's release, we
are at liberty to conclude that the rumour referred
to was not founded on fact. It is utterly unlikely
that Sir Alfred would take it upon himself to
oppose the extension of the prerogative of mercy
in a case in which it could fairly be alleged that
his personal feelings were in the remotest degree
involved.
The Norfolk Island Pioneer has given up
the ghost under very painful circumstances. I here
is only one compositor on the island, and he is a
one-horse individual, who, having become in-
flated with the exuberance of his own verbosity,
gave himself insufferable airs, finally declining
to work on any terms. Public meetings are being
held to implore the autocratic jobber to start
again, but he won’t, for it is joy to him to have!
the whole population on their knees, and as he
was everything from editor down to charwoman
and horse-power, he ranks as a bloated monopolist
and has no fear of competition.
The Queen s dislike of Gladstone dates
from 1868. She was averse to the destruction of
the English Church in Ireland, and showed a dis-
inclination to affix her signature to the Disestab-
lishment Bill. In his eagerness, Mr. Gladstone
blurted out: “ But, madam, you must sign.” The
Queen flushed, and rejoined with marked indigna-
tion : “Sir, do you know who I am?” “Yes,
madam, the Queen of England. But does your
Majesty know who I am ? I am the people of
England.” Whereupon the Queen summarily
brought the audience to a close, and in a few curt
words dismissed her Prime Minister, and bade him
learn better manners.
The £lOOO lately voted by the Victorian
Assembly to be invested on behalf of Marcus
| Clarke’s widow and family, will, it now seems,
| really be made available. Three years ago the
motion proposing this grant would have been
laughed down, in a House where perhaps not 10
members had read “ His Natural Life. The othei
day it was respectfully received and carried by a
; narrow majority. Why this change ! Whence
I this new-born adoration of the memory of the
j dead genius ? It is all along of My Lord Rose-
j ) je ,.y advertising poor Marcus’s book and saying a
few kind words about his widow. Since the visit
i of the harmless little Earl, nearly three years
back, it has become the fashion in Melbourne to
speak quite affectionately of Clarke and those he
; left behind. That very “ snobbery ” which the.
author satirised has now cheated for him hun-
dreds of admirers. Ere long we may hear of a
Marcus Clarke statue being unveiled in the pre-
sence of a concourse of tardy grovellers, and of a
Marcus Clarke Society, meeting once a month to
discuss works which passed almost unnoticed
until they had received the hall-mark of a real
live lord’s approval.
Poor Bartley Campbell, the author of “ My
Partner,” is dyingf*of brain-softening in an Ameri-
can asylum. This ought to be a warning to
George Darrell. By the way, a few friends looked
up Campbell, a little while back, and found him
playing billiards with another patient. It seems
the afflicted couple were scoring the game on an
eccentric system of their own. We can quite be-
lieve it. Only once in our life have we played a
“ hundred up ” with a lunatic, but wo remember
the occasion only too well. The poor beggar never
gave us a show for 10 minutes. He kept missing
the object ball and scoring himself six every time.
At last* his cue slipped, and he brought off a losing
hazard. “ Vour shot,” said the lunatic, “I’ve
broken down at an easy one.”
The Lord Mayor and Corporation of Dub-
lin went recently to open the new local swimming
baths. The Mayor is an eccentric poet, but in
spite of this the audience were horrified when he
turned up with only a towel round his waist, and
instead of making the usual speech jumped into
the water and swam across. Fancy “Wales”
when he goes to open a bridge taking a header
from the parapet and the lords spiritual and tem-
poral —as in duty bound —capsizing themselves
after him. Worse still, fancy a naked bishop fall-
ing upon a naked prince, and the stove-in Heir
Apparent being afterwards fished out by a weep-
ing nation. The idea is too hideously awful to be
entertained, yet that seems to be what wo arc
coming to.
Some recent rows on the subject of mining
boundaries in Queensland suggest that the Govern-
ment surveyors in that colony are returning to
first principles. In old days, when Sandy Fyfo was
sub-commissioner on the Palmer, the miner who
wanted a claim laid off used to liquor him up in
the first place, and then when he got Sandy on the
ground and the first peg in he would trot ahead
with a bottle of Hennessy under his arm. There
was no trouble then about area, direction, or any-
thing else, for the sub-commissioner would mark
the boundaries anyhow so long as he kept close in
the rear of the bottle. Perhaps somebody carried
a bottle in front when Mount Morgan was laid
out, or, considering the value of the property, it
may be that a whole grog-shop led the way.
Bismarck, according to his English bio-
grapher, has been tbe hardest liver of his genera-
tion. He has always been a great eater, deep
drinker, and heavy smoker. In his earlier days
he was what the Germans call a “ chain smoker,”
whose morning and night are connected by a cable
of cigars, each link of which is lighted'at the stump
of its predecessor. In his youth a mixture of
champagne and porter was his favourite beverage,
and to this day it is uncertain whether he drinks
more wine or more beer, for, as he recently de-
clared, to settle a wager on the subject, he drinks
both daily and with equal fondness. But his
tastes are catholic in drinking, and of spirits he
has a high opinion, laying down once with unction
the principle, “ I fed wine for children, champagne
for men, but schnapps for generals.
At a recent grand dinner party the Ger-
man Emperor was in the highest spirits, and
played the gallant to the Empress and other
notable ladies Avho were present, kissing their
hands frequently and with much fervour. These
attentions, which form one of the Emperor’s pecu-
liarities, the most jealous husbands do not resent,
for the flirtations of a nonagenarian are not
dangerous, but serve to amuse him and hurt no-
body. The late meeting of the German and Aus-
trian Emperors resolved itself into a nauseating
slobbering match between the two old men. The
Emperor William appears to have exceeded
Francis Joseph in fervency and demonstrativeness,
for whereas the latter merely kissed his brother
monarch several times with great heartiness, the
latter added weeping to the osculatory exercise,
and leaked freely down the back seams of the
Austrian Emperor’s coat.
Charlie Beal, sometime Australian Eleven
secretary, tells some queer stories of his English
experiences. At Chichester, just before the team
left England, an old resident said : “Ah ! you
gentlemen are lucay in being able to travel. One
time, 62 years ago, I was asked to go to Man-
chester, but I didn’t go, and I’ve lost my chance
now. ” The distance is about four hours by rail,
but the English turnip-sprouter of the old school
woul d make his will, and Md a solemn farewell
to his weeping friends before making such a
journey, and then the thoughts of the old home
and the church, and the cow, and the dear
familiar faces would overcome him, and he would
hid ambition begone and turn back to lay his
bones amongvkhese of his ancestors. Another old
resident asked Charles to take a parcel to Glenelg
(S. A.) for him. Beal replied that ho should ask
Giffcn, who lived thereabouts, but he replied :
“Oh ! I don’t know Giffen. You had better take
it, aud you can walk across with it some Sunday
morning.” But even this story is beaten by that
of a parson at Rockhampton (Q.), who received a
suggestion from his Presbyterian friends at home
that he should ride to Brisbane and hold an after-
noon service there occasionally, and when he
as.ked these porridge-fed clerics if they expected
him tp gallop 100 miles on tbe Sabbath Day they
set his (question down as savouring of an unholy
lark.
Mr. doe ißosistp (that distinguished Vic-
torian, who, “spying he would ne’qr consent,
consented” to accept a C.M.G.), lives in hopes of
working up toknighthood before the end of the
year. The true story of Joe’s original refusal to
attend the summons of Garter King at Arms
(useful creature!) and the subsequent pressure
put upon him by Sir Philip Cunliffe Owen and
others is A r ery instructive. Joe was whispered
that “ Wales” and the Queen would be “grieved”
if he didn’t take his “honour” along with the
rest of them. Finally, Sir Philip threw out hints
that if Joseph Avould rest contented Avith 0.M.G.,
in the meantime, then the coveted K. might be
tacked on shortly. That the voice of the tempter
prevailed is now a matter of history. But why
was all this trouble taken to overcome the feigned
reluctance of such a very mediocre mediocrity as Mr.
Bosisto 2 Because “Wales” and Co. beared that
an open assertion of colonial independence (real
or sham, it mattered not) might exereise a dan-
gerous influence on the rising generatien. They
reflected that the fact of a Victorian chemist
declining to let the Queen slip a ribbon round his
neck would have a bad moral effect. The Aus-
tralians hitherto had grovelled before royalty of
any sort or description with a A’igbur that was
most encouraging to the Tory promoters of “Im-
perial Federation.” Could they afford to have the
game interrupted by a sulky Bosisto ? No. If
Joe hadn’t graciously accepted his greatness the
Queen Avould haA r e C.M.G.’d him AA T hile under the
influence of chloroform.

What a charming trait in the female
character is benevolence! Some of our fair
women carry their thoughtfulness so far that they
strive to economise the funds and time of strug-
gling artists and medical students by offering
them gratuitous “Life Studies.” One lady at the
Sydney Royal last week was so peculiarly amiable
in this respect, that a medical enthusiast sitting
behind htr might easily have worked up, his
osteology during the entr'actes. As we reckorted
up the visible vertebra; and studied the shoulder-
blades under the expanse of white skin we won-
dered whether we were harking back to barbar-
ism, or whether extremes meet, and the ultra-
refinement of civilisation touches primeval sim-
plicity ?

This is told at the expense of one of the
“ Representative Australians ” at present making
shows of themselves in England. The day after
the arrival of this self-made Croesus in London he
called at a well-known banker’s to arrange about
opening an account. The genial old banker in-
vited him into his private room and the first
question he asked was, “ How are the Antipodes ?”
The representative was staggered. He had a
faint recollection of having heard “Antipodes”
before, but what it was, or what it meant, he
couldn’t for the wealth of the Indies tell. There was
only one thing he could do and that was to chance
an answer: “Oh,” he answered, stroking his
beard with his hand as if quite at home, “I only
arrived yesterday and haven’t had time to see
them yet. I’m going to look ’em up to-morrow!”

Sir Arthur Palmer, Lieutenant-Governor
of Queensland, visited Cooktown the other day.
He refused to be banqueted, but accepted
Mayor Davis’ invitation to a “ glass of champagne.”
The Mayor invited some 40 people to meet his
Excellency, who, in returning thanks, told them
that he could not see how he or they could possi-
bly benefit from thus meeting, and, having swal-
lowed his wine, he incontinently left without even
proposing little Davis’ health. But the fun came
in when at the next Council meeting Alderman
Galvin, an Italian, who keeps a pub., objected to
the Council paying the bill to the tune of £32 for
the “ shamp.” He, as a member of the reception
committee (please put the accent on the ulti-
mate), had agreed to the hire of host Balser’s trap
and the purchase of two bottles of champagne, and
Sir A. H. Palmer was to be driven round the
town and “ liquored up ” in the trap, but he did
not call £32 a glass of wine, and thought the
Mayor should pay for the lot. The councillors
determined to pay £2O, which, however, the
caterer refuses to take, and legal proceedings will
therefore shortly follow.

The respondent in a certain very quietly-
disposed-of Sydney divorce case (heard in camera
“to oblige a friend,” and not reported in the
newspapers to any appreciable extent) has married
her “gay Lothario” in England.
* * *
Which reminds one that the co-respondent
in a rather celebrated recent N.Z. divorce case
(he is related to Sir Charles Dilke) was, the other
day, about to make atonement to the lady he had
led astray, by marrying her. Everything had
been arranged for the ceremony in the pretty
little church at Merrivale, Christchurch’s most
aristocratic suburb. The amiable and liberal-
minded parson had been interviewed, and in due
time the party arrived at the church —only to find
that the bishop had interdicted all clergymen of
the diocese from extending religious marital rites
to tho pair of wanderers from the paths of moral
rectitude. However, the “dissenting” parson
across the way was ready to oblige, and smilingly
pocketed the bridegroom’s “ fiver.”

It is gratifying to the truly pious man
when he sees the heathen “left” and the opium-
chewing sinner wiped out, and Hi Yah, of Cook-
town (Q.), has been wiped out. A suburban belle
in that town was anxious to attend the races, but
neither she nor her lover could raise the needful
funds, so she “lookednice” at a cross-eyed yellow
man of Belial who dug in her father's garden, and
that deluded hybrid promptly undertook to find a
new dress, a hat, and a steed, provided he were
allowed to escort his charmer in person. He kept
his share of the bargain and turned up in gor-
geous attire, but to his horror his place was
usurped by a horse-load of human sin in the shape
of a white man who told him to “git.” Then Hi
Yah knelt down on the road and cursed his enemy
by every degraded image in the Central Flowery
Land, and he now sues the girl for £3 15s. “ goods
supplied,” but his tale is received with laughter
and derision and he will trust a Queensland maid
never again.

A queer incident presented itself “ on the
block,” in Hunter-street, Sydney, the other day.
A gentleman of the masher type was walking
along—cane in hand, creaseless nether coverings,
glossy hat, primrose in buttonhole, eyeing our
world superciliously through his eye-glass. Sud-
denly this gallant gentleman was confronted by a
woman of the lowest type—a woman whose shabby
print-frock constituted seemingly her sole article
of dress. Her face was cadaverous and thin—her
hair like oakum —tho whole toilette surmounted
by a battered straw hat. Such a woman as this
appearing on Sydney’s choicest promenade in the
blazing light of 4.30 p.m. could not fail to attract
attention. Guess the sensation, then, when this
creature stopped our gallant friend and held him
in conversation for about 15 minutes, while he
stood bolt upright afraid of what this lady might
shriek after him if he left her before she had quite
finished —and miserably, intensely conscious of the
subdued laughter around him! The incident
was laughable, but the dark side was rather too
prominent.

One untitled “representative Australian ”
now in England (he is a “ perfect daisy ” at grovel-
ling) is prancing round with cards labelled : “ The
Honorable —, and Miss .”
* * *
Potts Point and Toorak, now that Mr.
Dailey—long may he wave ! —is a Privy Council-
or, will be obliged to us for this information. The
‘ Honorable ” disappears in conversation alto-
gother, and is never put on a visiting-card. Its
principal use is in addressing a letter or in print.
When Macaulay was made a Privy Councillor he
seems to have been ignorant of the etiquette, for
he put “ Right Honorable ” on his card, and was for
nine days the laughing-stock of London. It is
well known that he dated a letter to his constitu-
ents from “Windsor Castle,” because he happened
for a day to be the guest of the Queen.

In the matter of ability to say gracefully
the thing that is not, few among the elect can
approach the young lady who “did” Admiral
Tryon s “At Home” last week for the Sydney
Echo. After calling “ lovely woman ”“ a charm-
ing accessory,” she propounds the conundrum :
“ No greater success could be attained or desired
by the most anxious host, and Admiral Tryon may
be warmly congratulated upon chancing upon the
first, having in himself and his naval coadiutors the
genial courtesy which goes to make the third,
while the height of Sydney’s season provided the
last.” How does that strike you ? Left to our
own devices we feel wholly unable to do full jus-
tice to the scene. The guests numbered fully 500,
and were gathered in a spirit of strict impar-
tiality. The Admiral has a big heart, and does
not confine his hospitality to the “ first families ”
only. His mode of entertaining his guests is ex-
tensive, embracing Aunt Sally (she’s dead) to
dancing in the house. But to again quote the
gifted one, “ It was all too fresh out of doors to
make dancing irresistible, people preferred wan-
dering through the shady walks or watching the
changing loveliness of the beautiful harbour.”
That’s all good. Lord and Lady Carington were
present, accompanied by the Hon. Baring and Mr.
Wallington. Lady Carington wore black moire
silk, plain and elegant as usual. This “ At Home ”
is, we believe, the last of the season, and before
ringing down the curtain let us congratulate the
Admiral on his social success. His hospitality has
been very extensive, no previous Admiral having
ever before attempted entertaining on so large a
scale.
Mb'
“NO FEAR!"
HER GRACIOUS, &c. : “THEN YOU WON’T GO TO AUSTRALIA, ALBERT EDWARD ?”
HE: “ WHY SHOULD I GO TO AUSTRALIA, MOTHER? NOTHING HAS COME OUT
ABOUT ME LATELY. IF THEY MUST HAVE SOMEBODY TO GROVEL TO,
LET US SEND DILKE ?”
At Auckland (N.Z.) there is now only one
masher left. The other one insisted on seeing a
lady home a week ago, and being kindly invited
inside found himself in the presence of a family
party. Then his hat and cane were thrown out-
side and he was flogged with a stout bamboo
until he devoutly wished he had been carting
road-metal, or following any other humble
avocation rather than mashing on that particular
evening. Finally he was also thrown out on his
little pink ear.

Among the shows of Sydney is one which
may often be seen gratis at Redfern station.
About 9 a.m., when the traffic is at its busiest,
“Black Maria” drives up and discharges its
cargo of wretched-looking, leg-ironed men or
miserable, draggled women, bound presumably
for country prisons, thus compelling the pas-
sengers coming in from the suburbs, whether male
or female, to encounter not only them, but the
gaping crowd which gathers to watch their move-
ments. For the sake of common humanity—or of
lady travellers, at all events —prisoners might be
despatched at some other hour, or from some
other spot than the ordinary platform.

The colonial dancing female has received a
serious check in Wellington (N.Z.) A young wife
there went to a hop, while her husband sat at
home with his head against the wall and held the
baby. After some hours, however, being unable
to soothe the little yeller, he went to the ball and
asked his fond partner to return, whereupon she
told him to go to Greece and leave her to her en-
joyment. Half-an-hour afterwards the father
solemnly wheeled a perambulator across the hall
and ran his squalling brat right into the quadrille
where his wife was disporting herself. Then he
yelled out, “ Mary, here’s the baby ; he’s hungry,”
and walked out. The lady has not been to a dance
since.

In Melbourne, the raising of cash to pro-
vide a testimonial to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales
is still tearing ahead like a frightened snail.
Fathers of families and others are warned not to
send in more than two guineas, as the individual
contrib. is restricted to that sum, for fear the
treasurer might get so much money that it would
turn his brain. The intention is to present Albert
Edward with a service of plate. If the fund keeps
up its present rate of increase, the trustees expect
to be in a position to forward a coffin-plate by the
time H.R.H, “shuffles off.”
* » #
Just as the Union Club ball is supposed to
shut down the lid on all Sydney “ sassiety” doings,
so the Steeplechase day winds up the Randwick
racing carnival, and this year it wound it up well.
There was a big crowd, and round each favourite
a little knot of men and women were gathered.
The custom of ladies walking among the thorough-
breds is highly dangerous ; we saw a colt lash out
and put his foot through a lady’s sunshade and
then take it out again. Moral—the saddling-pad-
dock is not the place for womankind. On the lawn
the scene “was bright and animated,” though
some of the dresses worn were enough to frighten
one. Among those who dress badly, the women
whose years revolve about the uncertain “ forties”
are strikingly conspicuous. They never seem to
hit off the stylo that best suits their age, Hoping
everyone will think them five and twenty, yet
mortally fearing they will be guessed at least
fifty, they find themselves in a position of em-
barrassment, with the result that they look
fifty about the face and fifteen about the ancles.
On the other hand, we do not remember ever
having seen more becoming gowns, or more pretty
girls. Melbourne had sent us a very fine contri-
bution, in fact, so fine that our Sydney girls saw
nothing in them to admire. Pale blue and white
were tho ruling colours of the costumes, while
hats and bonnets were even more fetching than
usual. Brides were rather plentiful, in fact tho
bride business was a little overdone ; still there
must be brides whether other girls (who are not)
like it or the reverse. The men turned out look-
ing better than usual, the English dudes being
more quietly clad than is their wont. That check
suit from Government House has, we hear, been
returned to Europe, Sydney not being advanced
sufficiently for the pattern. Yellow top boots,
and two “ foot” spurs, were absent, and, in fact,
there was an unusual air of respectability about
the imported mashers. Carriages, both ancestral
and hired, were in great request, and it was
charming to wander among the former and see the
coats-of-arms emblazoned on their panels. It took
one back to the history of our country when we
saw the griffins and lions rampant, with a
crown above them and a motto underneath
that told the virtues of the owners. The
hired “growlers” had just the same kind
of armorial bearings, which was odd, and had
just as good a claim to them, which wasn’t. No
doubt it is impossible to cater for so great a
crowd, but still we felt only partly happy when we
got our share of luncheon and found it to be a
venerable drum-stick. That made us feel bad,
but when we planked ss. and the waiter held out
his hand for a tip, we gave it —with our lightning
“left.” That waiter was taken to hospital in
H.E.’s “carriage.” Lady Ca-ington wore an
elegant costume of cream merveilleux satin, a
charming bonnet and parasol to match; Mrs.
Terry, a very becoming derss of striped cream
silk with pretty French bonnet; Mrs. C. Hogg, a
lovely gown of cream surah with graceful dra-
peries of spotted gauze and lace, tight-fitting
jacket of lace and white brads, small bonnet en
suite; Mrs. Arthur Blackwood. (Melbourne), a
pretty soft-white China silk dress with flounce of
fine cream lace and long panel of a dark-coloured
silk, white bonnet and parasol to match ; a young
lady in white, large hat, and eyes to match, looked
absolutely enthralling.
* * *
“The Mikado,” at Sydney Royal, on
Steeplechase night, drew a most uncomfortable
crush, who sat out the piece in a very heated
atmosphere. The latter contingency a well-
known society woman, fat and forty, had fully
expected, judging from the manner in which she
i
j stood out of her clothes. “ Isn’t she funny ? ” ex
claimed a terrible enfant at her elbow —“ she’s
just like a half-peeled banana.”

The Mayoress of Melbourne’s last after-

No wonder Spotforth’s “ average ” has
fallen off. He has been in the throes of love all
this trip, and got married last week. Wo suppose
he will henceforth walk in the ways of Murdoch,
and devote all his spare time to domestic happi-
ness :
Farewell, dear Spoff., your reign is “ over
No more excited crowds will shout at you ;
Give up the game and live in clover—
For marriage will take the “ demon ” out of you.
Bonnor, it is cabled, was boat man. The lady
whom Spoff. has captured, is said to be handsome,
witty, and tolerably well-gilt. Further, it is said
that the case was one of love at first sight. Which
is very likely true. It is hard to believe that any
pretty girl could have deliberately fallen in love
with Spoff.
* *
Fully 900 persons were present at the St.
Vincent’s Hospital ball held in Sydney Exhibition
Building on the 22nd September. A large share
of the patronage which this event annually
receives may perhaps be ascribed to the fact that
the hospital relies solely upon the generosity of the
general public for its maintenance, no State aid
being invoked. The building was lighted by
electricity, the engine being under the direction
of Mr. E. C. Cracknoll who gave every satisfac-
tion. Vice-royalty assisted the show, and
ample decorations hid, or at least relieved the
baroness of the building. Dancing concluded
somewhere about daybreak.

On Tuesday, the 21st hist., H.E. and
Lady Carington entertained some 250 guests at a
musical evening, Government House. The music
was given in the ball-room, the performers being
placed on a platform running across one end of
the room. The company consisted of Admiral
Tryon, Captain Lake, the officers of H.I.M.S.
Albatross, Sir William and Lady Manning, Mr.
and Mrs. Joseph, Mr. and Mrs. Purves, Hon. W.
H. Suttor, Mr. Kellermann, Dr. Marano, Mr. and
Mrs. Samuel, and many others. The programme
consisted of 10 numbers. Mrs. Merewether con-
tributed a polonaise, Mrs. Stoddart sang Gounod’s
“ Noel,” the organ was played by the Hon. John
Baring ; Mrs. Forbes Angus sang charmingly. The
dresses were above the mark. We particularly
noticed several of them, but as envy is sufficiently
rampant we will refrain.

We regret to hear of the death of Mrs.

It is said that since the marriage of the
happy Quong Tart, the visits of his quondam lady
customers have become comparatively angelic, or
few and far between. This doesn’t surprise us in
the least. We have always declared the dear girls
used to go not for their tea but their nice little
Tart. And now he is married, Yum Yum !

Thus says the Sunday Times : —“The boys
of the nautical school-ship, Vernon, who are being
trained by Captain Neitenstein to lead good lives,
were yesterday released from the ordinary rules,
and made the guests of a number of ladies.” Now
what in thunder does all this mean?

Madame Sunimerhayes must have had up-
hill work to get through her concert, which came
off on the 23rd inst., as the audience was scanty
and sleepy. Nothing is harder than to Wake a

Armidale (N.S.W.) society assembled oil
the 17th Sept., at Moorowa, the residence of the
Hon. John Richardson, M.L.C., and danced the
night through with energy attainable only in tho
country. A long programme of dances was dis-
cussed under the inspiration of music worthy of
the occasion and the entertainers. The capabili-
ties of Moorowa for the enjoyment of dancing are
great, and the enjoyment on this occasion was in
direct ratio to the accessories.

“The Queen,” we read, “has not yet

away with pincers, and Lady Dudley lost a necklet

work of art and a family jewel the locket was
priceless. Iho Hon. Mrs. Cholmondely had a

made to snatch a diamond earring from the ear
of the Countess of Exeter by a person who dis-

ness of breath, costive-
ness,scurvy, blotches on
theskin,disturbed sleep,
frightful dreams,and all
nervous and trembling
sensations, &e. ihe first
dose will give relief in
twenty minutes. This is no fiction, for they have
done it in thousands of cases. Every sufferer ia
earnestly invited to try one box of these Pills, and
they will be acknowledged to be
WORTH A GUINEA A BOX.
For females of all ages these Pills are invaluable,
as a few dos'es of them carry off all gross humours,
open all obstructions, and bring about all that is
required. No female should be without them. There
is no medicine to be found to equal EEBCHAM’S
PILLS for removing any obstruction or irregularity
of the system. If taken according to the directions
given with each box they will soon restore females of
all ages to sound and robust health.
For a weak stomach, impaired digestion and all
disorders of the liver, they act like “ MAGIC,” and a
few doses will be found to work wonders upon the
most important organs of the human machine. They
strengthen the whole muscular system, restore the
long-lost complexion, bring back the keen edge of
appetite, and arouse into action with the ROSEBUD
of health the whole physical energy ?f the human
frame. These are “PACTS ” admitted by thousands
embracing all classes of society; and one of the
best guarantees to the nervous and debilitated is,
Beecham’s Pills have the largest sale of any patent
medicine in the world.
BEECHAM’S MAGIC COUGH PILLS.
As a remedy for Coughs in general, Asthma, Diffi-
culty in Breathing, Shortness of Breath, Tightness
and Oppression of the Chest, Vf beezing, &e., these
Pills stand unrivalled; and any one labouring under
any of the above complaints need only try One Box
to prove that they are the best ever offered to the
public for Asthmatic and Consumptive Coughs,
Hoarseness, and Oppression of the Chest. They
speedily remove that sense of oppression and difficulty
of breathing which nightly deprive the patient of rest.
They give almost instant relief and comfort to those
afflicted with the above distressing and, when neg-
lected, dangerous complaints. Let any person troubled
with any of the above complaints give Beecham’s
Cough Pills a trial.
The most violent Cough will in a short time be
removed.
Caution. —The public are requested to notice tin t
the words “ Beecham’k Pills, St. Helens,” are on the
Government Stamp affixed to each box of the Pills.
If not on they are a forgery.

WATCH
!FP KIDfJEYg.
They are the most important secretory organs.
Into and through the Kidneys flow the waste fluids of
the body, containing poisonous matter taken out of
the system. If the Kidneys do not act properly this
matter is retained, the whole system becomes dis-
ordered, and the following symptoms will follow
Headache, Weakness, Pain in the Small of back and
loins, flushes of heat, chills, with disordered stomach
and bowels. You can thoroughly pmtect the Kidneys
by Hr. Bell’s Bitters, and when any of these symptoms
manifest themselves you can quickly rid yourself of
them by this best of all medicines for the'Kidneys—
Dr. Bell’s Bitters.
What is Dyspepsia?
Among the many symptoms of Dyspepsia or Indi-
gestion the most prominent are; —Variable appetite ;
faint, gnawing feeling at. pit of the stomach, with un-
satisfied craving for food ; heartburn, feeling of
weight and wind in the stomach, bad breath, bad
taste in the mouth, low spirits, general prostration,
headache, and constipation. There is no form of
disease more prevalent than dyspepsia, and none so
peculiar to the high-livingand rapid-eating Australian
people. Alcohol and tobacco produce Dyspepsia;
also bad air, rapid eating, &c. Dr. Bell’s Bitters will
cure the worst ease by regulating the bowels and
toning up the digestive organs. Sold everywhere.
Noth.— Any poor Person, or the manager of any
Hospital, Asylum, ©r Old People’s Home, may obtain
the Bitters gratuitously, upon written application to
the Agents, accompanied by a certificate of a Minister
of the Gospel, certifying that they are unable to pay
for medicine.

“ DEMOCRAT’S ” CREDENTIALS.
Extract from Sydney Sunday News :—
“ In our advertising eolnmns will be found the
public notices of ‘ Democrat’s ’ Consultations on
the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups for 1886, which
promise to be most popular undertakings on the
part of the spirited and enterprising promoter of
those wonderful ‘ fortune-making ’ lotteries. It is
not often that we have a good word to say of racing
consultations as a rule, hut in ‘Democrat’s’ case
we can strongly recommend them to the public, as
we happen to know the moving spirit—one of the
right sort, and who is proverbial in racing circles
for honest and square dealing. One of the best
features of ‘ Democrat’s ’ consultations is the fact
of the drawing being conducted by a committee
of influential gentlemen, whose names are above
suspicion. 1
Extract from Yass Courier :
“We desire to draw attention to an advertisement which,
announces the conditions of ‘Democrat’s’ uonsultations on
the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups. The consultations are
most popular with the public, and they have received most
favourable notices from the press, and this is scarcely ever
found in sporting matters, only in cases where the business
transacted is of an honourable and genuine nature.
Extract from Wallsend Sun.
“‘Democrat’ announces his famous consultations, com-
mencing with the Caulfield Oup, run on October 16th ; and
the Melbourne Cup, run on November 2nd. The Sydney
press gives ‘ Democrat’ an excellent character as a promoter
of sweeps, hence the public have a guarantee that the trans-
action is carried on fair and above board.”
Extract from Nyngan Mercury and Macquarie Advertiser
“We would draw attention to ‘ Democrat’ll ’ advertiremei t
of his consultations, by which it will be seen that he has
both large and small sweeps open upon all the principal
events to come off shortly. As ‘Democrat’ is highly spoken
of by the press, and has the reputation of conducting his
sweeps fairly, we can recommend him to our friends who
wish to invest money on any event."
Several other newspapers have borne similar testimony to
the genuineness of " Democrat’s” consultations,

never for a moment dreamt that yo u, would in-
quiry as an actual invitation. IiOW
ever, as you have come I suppose W 6
shall have to proceed with the fegtfvj
ties and open the Bondi sewer 1 ”

of Sydney Harbour are curious.
The inhabitants break off bits thereof
and eat them. I tried some, and it
tasted uncommonly like oysters.”—

President of British Association : M I’m blowed if I can make
out whether this is an invitation or not.”
“ The opening of the Bondi sewer
wag the event of our visit. Only
members of the 8.A.. were admitted
to the Sewer, and these were fur-
■nished with eau-'
de-cologne at the
Government
expense.”
From the Natural-
ist’s Diary : “ Saw a
larrikin to-day stand-
ing on his hind legs.
How he managed to do
it in such boots puzzles
ime. The gaol authori-
ties have promised
me a specimen for
dissection soon, as
they are going to hang
a lot for some outrage
or other lately committed.”
“At a meeting of the British Associa-
tion, held in Sydney, -th, 1888, Doc-
tor Moonshine read a paper on the Propa-
gation of the Bunyip. The Association
have to report that they can sleep just as
well in Sydney as in any othdl part of the
world."
Prof. Tublittle’s report. “ I tested the velocity of the
Wind in a Southerly Buster and find that a hat blown
from a bakbheaded party will travel at the rate of 75
miles in a minute.”
