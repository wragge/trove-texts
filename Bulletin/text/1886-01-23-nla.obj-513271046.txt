The Bishop of Manchester.
The Bulletin.
SATURDAY, JANUARY 23, 1886.
TBi translation of Dr, McoßHOusafrom the
gee of Melbourne to that of Manchester is
an event of more than ordinary importance,
not alone to the members pf his Church, but
to Australians generally. No other clergy-
man was credited with filling so large a
space In the intellectual and religious life of
the colony. An admirable speaker, a liberal
churchman, and a ripe scholar, he came to
Melbourne nearly 10 years ago, and quickly
secured in the public life of the people a
position in which he had no predecessor.
Not long since he was appointed Chancellor
of the University. The question of appoint-
ing an ecclesiastic to such a post was hotly
contested, it will be remembered. It was
thought a dangerous precedent to establish
in a country possessing no State Church—a
country in which all religions were alike-
In the public journals and from the plat-
form many men opposed the choice as a
matter of principle. It was considered a
step in the direction of interference by the
priest in educational affairs, an interference
which has borne such questionable fruit in
other countries. It is scarcely necessary to
say that no such result followed, butfor this
the University authorities deserve no thanks.
The experiment was, at least, a hazardous
one. When we consider the long and far
from finally-decided struggle to confine the
ecclesiastic to the teaching of the knowledge
he has acquired concerning the next world,
the opinion gains ground that the less he
interferes with the affairs of this the better
it will be for all parties.

By securing an early passage to England,
Dr. Moobhouse may get a chance of sitting
in the House of Lords, as, although murmurs
against the composition of that august body
are abroad, it is unlikely that, with the
Irish question still unsettled, and others
almost as important pressing for solution,
Messrs. Chambbblain, Bkablaugh, Labou.
chkrx, and their henchmen will be able to
find leisure to bait it for some little time.
Still, it is as well for the Bishop not to
dawdle. There is a dangerous spirit of in-
subordination abroad. Even “Hodge,” for
whose benefit the Church was established, is
beginning to show signs of unrest. This
unreasonable person, having lately secured
a vote, appears to be now employed deter-
mining the worst possible way in which to
use it. With phenomenal ingratitude he
falls to see why the rector should have
the biggest house in town, or the bishop
the smoothest croquet lawn and sleeves.
"Hodge ” has taken to reading, too* and so,
when such facts as the following are placed
before him, it is small wonder that his head
receives an additional scratch in order that
the lessons they teach may find an en-
trance :
"It Is a melancholy thing,” says Sidney Smith,
to see men clothed in soft raiment, lodged in a
Public palace, endowed with a rich portion of
other men’s Industry, using their Influence to
deepen the ignorance and inflame the fury of
their fellow-creatures.”
“In 1807 power was sought by Bill to enable
magistrates to provide rate-supported schools
wherever they were wanted. The Archbishop of
Canterbury lifted up his testimony against it, and
It was rejected without a division. * Their lord-
ships would feel,’ he said, * how dangerous it might
be to Innovate in such matters. Their lordships’
Ptudence would, no doubt, guard against innova-
tions that might shake the foundations of our
teUgion.’"
“In 1810 shop-lifting to tho amount of sa. meant
death, it was proposed to substitute transporta-
tion. The vote was rejeeted by 31 to 11. Not a
tlogle bishop was found in the minority. At the
beginning of the century 333 crimes were punish-
able by death. When Romilly and Holland tried
to reduce number, the bishops to a man
‘guarded against innovations that might shake the
foundations of religion.’ ”
“Twenty-five bishops voted against allowing
Roman Catholics to sit in Parliament; 33 to keep
Roman Catholic peers out of the Upper House; 30
against the third reading of Catholic emancipation.
For 35 years the Jewish Disabilities Bill was work-
ing its way through the Upper House—the bishops
blocking it at every step. Archbishop Howley
held that * the moral and intellectual capacities of
the Jews disqualified, them for all legislative
duties.’ This, considering that one-half of Christen-
dom worshipped a Jew and the other half a Jewess t
was thoughtful.”

Moobhouse that, at the rate things are

ous to remain away too long from Manches-
ter if he has any desire to record his vote.
But, after all, the chief interest for Austra-
lians m the life and teachings of Dr. Moor-
house during his long sojourn among them
lies in the attitude assumed by him towards
some of the great theological and state ques-
tions of the day. His Liberalism, of which
no ecclesiastical training could entirely
rob him, occasionally brought him perilously
near the rapids that frequently land even
the ablest men in the swamps of heterodoxy.
On the important subject of prayer, for in-
stance, his views wore not quite so sound as
many would wish. He had a decided lean-
ing towards the belief that cutting canals
.possessed some advantages over praying for
rain—that, for obtaing pure water, con-
structing reservoirs was superior to fasting.
In professing adhesion to these ideas he col-
lided with the opinions of many estimable
Victorians—men who from long practice
had discovered the precise form of suppli-
cation best adapted for arresting thunder
clouds. The controversy on the subject
will be remembered by many, and showed
the extensive insight into the ways of Pro-
vidence possessed by some of our neigh-
bours—especially of the Presbyterian faith.
The bishop, we think, got a little the worst
of the argument, which is scarcely to be won-
dered at, when it is rembered how fre-
quently full waterholes and overflowing
dams have resulted from a combined ap-
peal on empty stomachs. Why the result
has not always been so satisfactory, or why
a flood so often came when only a shower
was asked for, was, probably, due either to
some natural law at present undisoo> ered
or to some hitch in the arrangements caus-
ing a garbled message to be sent. In the
matter of miracles, too, the Bishop’s con-
clusions were not always consonant
with established beliefs. W© believe
we do him no injustice by stating that
the history of Jonah’s experiences and of
the peouliarites inherent in Sampson’s hair
when suffered to remain undisturbed, were
looked upon by him with vague suspicion—
possibly because in his eyes mere solar
myths closely allied wi( h the records of the
Hubbabd family, and the old person who
lived, so long in a shoe that all desire to
change her place of residence—at least till
her children were reared—entirely left her.
On one or two occasions Dr. Moobhouse and
the late Maecus Clause came to blows, and
it was whispered at the time that the good
Bishop was second at the winning post.
• ♦ ♦
We have hinted that there were several
grave theological questions which the Doctor
left carefully alone or touched in such away
as to leave them rather more “mixed” than
they previously were. This, of course, wft*
no fault of his. If it were possible to dispel-
all clouds of unbelief, life would lose some of
its best attractions. To come nearer home>
consider how dull and tame a Sunday after-
noon’s walk through the Sydney Domain
would be if the opinion were universal that
man was merely a piece of mud with the
faculty of locomotion and an oddly carve#
head? How oppressively monotonous exis-
tence would be if the question of talking
snakes or speaking donkeys were removed:
from the region of doubt and placed beyond
ambiguity! There were two matters, how-
ever, in no way connected with Theology, on
which the Bishop adopted uncompromising
views, and seized every opportunity for’
expressing them. They were Irrigation and
Imperial Confederation. Regarding the
first, there is now but one opinion. A com-
prehensive scheme for Victoria is not alone
possible, but would be lucrative. The
manner in which, by means of water, the
Chinese make deserts into gardens, and the
Saracens made Morocco and Spain the
wonder of mediaaval travellers, is well-
known. But it is not so easy to dispose of
the question of Imperial Federation with
which the Bishop appears so enamoured.
Suppose we put it like this. Would it to-day
be advantageous to England, or to America,
or to the world, if the countries had never
separated ? We contend that it Is best for
all three that the separation took place. It
s best for England, because if the United
States were still a portion of the British
Empire and federated with the latter there
would now be over 400 American represen-
tatives, comprising, probably, over 100 of
Irish descent, in the House of Commons.
The centre of the Empire would have
changed from London to Washington, for
either the Americans would insist on its
following the population—thus reducing
England to a province—or, which is much
the same thiog, they would govern from
London, not in accordance with British
ideas, but in consonance with Yankee one/.
And if it be said—“ Yes, but the population
of the United States would not be nearly s«
great to-day if it had remained a colony', so
that Britain would still have the predomi-
nance,” no further argument is necessary to
show that America has gained by becoming
free. Again, had America remained
in the Empire, Democracy would hot
to-day be nearly so vigorous as it is—would
not have driven a wedge right into the
heart of Europe. The stupid principles of
hereditary government and of high-sound-
ing titles would, probably, still be in full
swing over the vast countries between the
Atlantic and the Pacific. Every way you
look at the subject there will be found com-
plications and jealousies ready to spring up
like mushrooms. Of this we may be oertbin.
One of the countries would have to take a
subordinate position, and it would not be
America.

These arguments against a political bond
between Britain and the United States be-
come even stronger when applied to a simi-
lar tie between Britain and Australia—or,
at least, they will become so as time goes
on with its inevitable increase of population.
For America is but a week’s steam from
Europe, while Australia is five or sqc. It
might add to the vanity of coming English
rulers to be also monarchs of a populous
Australia. But what advantage a powerful
Australian Federal Republic, able to defend
her own shores, could derive from clinging
to the skirts of a little island on the other
side of the world quite puzzles us to dis-
cover, and we cannot say that Dr. Mooh-
house’s explanation put the matter ip $
clearer light.

the port, visited the course and backed him in the

ceived a £50 dividend. “ What a day they were

In England, the Eclipse Stakes of £10,000,
for 1888, failed to fill, but the managers have not
yet given up the race. They have made several
alterations in the conditions, and owners have
now a chance of appropriating the ten thou, for a
£5 note. Even on these terms, however, difficulty
will be experienced in raising the necessary 300
entries, as most of the extensive public breeding
studs have been broken up.
We are likely next year to have J. L. Sul-
livan, the American champion “knocker out,”
over here, he having signed a contract at Pitts-
burg with John Cannon, of New York city, under
whose management he agrees to make a tour of
Europe and Australia. He agrees to meet any
man who may be brought against him at any time,
under any circumstances, with or without gloves,
or under any rules. Sullivan will, no doubt, make
a pile in Australia at the “Hippodrome ” business,
but we have nothing over here to meet him with
any chance of success in a genuine match. Should
a good middleweight accompany the show, how-
ever, colonials may have a chance of seeing a bit
of genuine sport.
Writes “Peter the Hermit,” in the Well-
ington (N.Z.) Evening Press “ One of the most
vulgar things I ever saw done, I think, was at a
table d'hote la Switzerland, where a large company
of all nations were about to breakfast. There was
only one clergyman present, a Prench Catholic
priest, who, with a quiet glance round the table,
rose and said a simple grace—merely a few words
of thanksgiving for food and of supplication for
divine blessing. It was a grace that any child
might have lisped over its bread and milk. But
there arose an English woman, a lady, alas, by
social station, who. having been reared in the
strictest sect of the Pharisees, did not consider a
Catholic priest’s grace a grace at all. She accord-
ingly delivered a long grace of her own, to the
profound edification apparently ox three
daughters, who looked too pretty to be humbugs,
a solemn governess, and a priggish young man
who, I fancy, was destined for holy orders and
had matrimonial designs on one of the girls. I
was equally amused and pleased to see the poor
old priest, who had already sat down and opened
his serviette, at once rise to his feet and remain in
an attitude of prayer until the silly woman had
finished, when he bowed his head and said ‘Amen,’
The foreigners at table affected polite indifference
at this novel demonstration of the proverbial
eccentricity—and snobbishness—of the ‘ mad Eng-
lish,’; but several of them asked me afterwards
what It meant, and I confess I wss only able to
eay that it wag a piece of unpardonable rudeness.”

Bradlaugh’s Triumph.
The attempt of the House of Commons to con-
stitute Itself a cluh with power to set aside the
verdict of a constituency and exclude a member,
duly elected and legally qualified, has failed, as it
deserved to fall. Charles Bbadlaugh was
chosen member for Northampton on April 3,1880,
and for nearly six years, while the fact of his
membership has been admitted, he has been pre-
vented by the vote of a majority of his fellow-
members from performing the duties attaching to
his position. The Tory effort to bar the way to the
newly-assembled House has proved a dreary fiasco,
and Charles Bbadlaugh, sitting, speaking, and
voting therein, will have the grim satisfaction of
seeing some of his most bigoted and ruthless
opponents—men like Newdkgate, Drummond
Wolee, Wabxon, and O’Donnell— gazing wist-
fully from the strangers’ gallery at the seats
which happily know them no more. Mr. Bbad-
Lauqh deserves the triumph he has won. Almost
unknown when 18 years ago he first appealed to
the constituency of Northampton which he now
represents, he was thrice rejected, but he has been
four times successful since his first election, and
he goes in this time with over 4800 votes to his
credit.
* ♦ *
Now that he has won the day against odds which
at first appeared overwhelming, an effort is being
made to induce people to believe that the porten-
tous struggle was entirely one of his own seeking.
He wanted to be persecuted. Just as some of the
old Inquisitors affirmed that the martyr-heretics,
actuated by the Devil, liked to be burned, so the
bigots now insinuate that Bbadlaugh courted
these years of unceasing trouble and strife. The
Tory sympathisers in our local Press give us an
earnest of the way in which similar sycophants are
clacking the wide world over. The Hekald of
January 15 says:—
" Mr. Bbadlaugh has himself to thank for the
troubles which came upon him. He was foolish
enough to parade his Atheism before the members
of the House of Commons, and to express con-
tempt for some of the vital Christian doctrines;
and hon. members resented this display as vulgar
and offensive.”
Later on, in the same day, the Evening News
echoes the cry:—
“ still, It Is but just to remember that Brad-
laugh originally assumed an attitude which
directly and ostentatiously provoked the fierce
opposition with which he was met. The path
which b»s now been administered to him be then
positively declined to subscribe to, and claimed
the right to substitute for that ceremony a simple
affirmation'”
Now either these writers know that what they
state is untrue, in which case they are—well, Tory
journalists; or else they are Ignorant of the sub-
ject they profess to criticise, in which event it is
simple Impudence for them to pose as public in-
structors. A glance at the columns of Hansard,
or at the compact evidence given by the Clerk of
the House, Sir Thomas Ehskine May, before the
Select Committee of 1880, would have told them,
if they did not know It already, that Mr. Bbad-
laugh never made any reference to his theologi-
cal, or antl-theological views before the members
of the House, and never declined to subscribe to
the oath. He believed that he had the same
right to a choice—oath or affirmation—as he
had when he . gave evidence in a court of
justice. Eminent lawyers like the Attorney-
General and Solicitor-General of Mr. Gladstone’s
Government, Sir Henry Jackson, Q.C., Mr.
Watkin Williams, Q.C., and Mr. Sergeant
Simon, Interpreted the law in a similar fashion.
+ * *
As an honourable man, what other steps could
Mr.l Bbadlaugh, well-known as a Secularist
leader, have taken than the one adopted by him ?
With choice, as he and others supposed, of oath or
affirmation, what could he do but ask to be
allowed to affirm, mentioning at the same time
the statutes which, he presumed, justified the
House in granting his request? This was
all he did. Had he done less, — had he
quietly taken the oath the very men who
now charge him with courting his prolonged
persecution would have assailed him as a sneak
and a hypocrite, who had the courage of his
opinions on the stump, but was so awed by the
majesty of Parliament that he dared not even ask
to affirm when affirmation lay ready to his hand.
He has acted consistently with his opinions
throughout, affirming when the right to affirm was
granted him, and going through the, to him, idle
ceremony of oath-taking, when a foolish law—
whloh will ere long be repealed—thrust the cere-
mony upon him. He has not “paraded his
Atheism ” before the House. He has never
«declined to subscribe to the oath.” He
has always declared that if he took the oath
it would be binding on his, honour and conscience
the same as an affirmation. His sole offence lay In
the honesty which impelled him to avow his pre-
ference for affirmation rather than oath, If the law
permitted him such option. Those who perse-
cuted him and promulgated falsehoods regarding
him, until most readers believed them to be true,
profess to be pious and religious people. Bbad-
laugh has only had honesty on his side, hut
honesty has once more proved itself a mightier
thing than bigotry.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Bloodless Conflict.
TflE strike of wharf-labourers and seamen in Mel-
bourne marks a transition stage in the relation of
Capital to Labour. Nearly 3000 Imen have been
directly affected by the dispute, and negotiations
have been prolonged and bitter. But, in spite of
the importance of the points at issue, and not-
withstanding the fact that Capital and Labour
have been in direct conflict, no actual punishable
breach of the law has taken place. The letters
from the employers have not been more courteous
than those from the men. Throughout, the con.
test has more resembled a match between two
chess-players, than a battle of masters and men.
It is quite true that a threatening letter to Mr.
Barren Smith has been published, but it la quite
as likely that this was written by an unknown
friend as by an anonymous foe: neither in tone
or in purpose is It In keeping with any other action
of the men. Aided by generous support from other
organisations, the men, whose only capital is their
brawny arms, have been able to stand quietly by
while their representatives fought their battles, and
although it ia impossible as we write to state the
full result, this cannot be other than a substantial
victory for the men. Ton years ago such a contest
could not have been carried on without breaches
of the law and damage to property. Now, the
men, strong in the justice of their cause, and aided
by their batter organisation, can deal with the
capitalist in a spirit of confidence and determina-
tion. The unity of the men has proved that
Labour and Capital are not to one another a 8
Servant and Master, but are co-sharers in the pro-
duct of their union. Practically, the con-
test has been the result of a demand by the men that
they shall be partners in the profits of their toil.
This is but the beginning. The enfranchisement
of Labour is at hand. For centuries the oppressed
slave of Capital, it is now claiming its freedom
and just rights. In vain shall the Church teach
that men should “ be content with that station to
which God has called them.” For ages a pander-
ing hierarchy was able to persuade men that the
labour of their hands was a Qon-given guerdon
to the aristocracy of the land. Men now are too
enlightened to be satisfied with such doctrines,
and as the Church o mtinucs to teach them,
it is no wonder that the labouring classes
despise a religious organisation which uses
its influence to keep from them the gift of their
freedom. One feature of the strike la worthy of
special notice. That is the force the men have
acquired by their community of action. Capital
is always handed together; it is only iately that
Labour has become so. In future the two factors
must meet on even terms in this respect. Ulti-
mately labour must become master of the position.
Capital without Labour ia useless. Labour, on the
contrary, is hut so much Capital in the rough. It
always has the power of creating a reserve of
itself, and this reserve ia Capital. We congratulate
the men not only on the result of the strike, what-
ever that result may ho, but also on their
moderation, which is, of itself, a guarantee of
future and permanent advancement.
Bunkum Banquets.
Tr is about time that this mutuai-soap-and-sawder
complimentary-banquet fraud should be burst up.
The New South Wales Telegraph Department
seems especially corrupted by the disease. First
we h*d the subordinates buttering their [chief—
Ceacknell the 1 ivine (a decent enough fellow in
his way, and clever at his business when he
chooses to work), Dan O Connoe in the chair, and
as Postmaster-General showering exaggerated and
fulsome compliments upon an official whose real
capabilities and value he had no opportunity of
ascertaining. Next we have P. B. Walkek, the
second in command,' similarly buttered by his
clerks; and now we hear that the Postmaster-
General himself is to have the slush-bucket
emptied over him in the same fashion.
Now, take the Walker banquet as an example.
Here is, in a modified form, what we are told of
the secret history of that " spontaneous ” compli-
ment:—On Friday, the 15th, an elaborate report
was published in the Herald and Daily Tele-
gbaph of a banquet given by the officers of the
Telegraph Department to Mr, P. B. Walker, as-
sistant superintendent, prior to hia departure for
Europe. The Evening News even went further
than that, and stated that about 100 members of
the Telegraph Department were present. Now,
there were no representatives of the Press present,
and it is a fair inference that the proceedings were
“furnished” to the papers, the Herald and Tele-
graph reports being Identical. As these reports
are false, and consequently misleading (conveying
the idea of a spontaneous outburst of love
and admiration for Mr. Walker’s popularity and
genius) they should in some way ha contradicted
for the sake of the 100 members of the Department
who did not give Mr. Walker a banquet as
described. A short time ago a meeting was con-
vened for the purpose of testing the feeling of the
officers towards giving Mr. Walker a farewell
banquet, and, as only about six of the officers
attended, any reasonable person would have con-
cluded that the idea was repugnant to the officers
as a body, and consequently the matter should have
dropped. But the crawling elements were not to
be balked, and in order to raise the wind a circu-
lar was sent round to the country stations, asking
them to recognise Mr. Walker's “ able adminis-
tration ” of the Department by subscribing to
a farewell banquet, and the said circular being
duly signed by a high official, and being couched
in terms savouring of cosrcion rather than sup-
plication, the desired amount was raised, and a few
“ deadheads ” having been run in, the affair was
the sort of brilliant success depicted in the papers.
There is also an account of an elaborate address
presented to Mr. Walker, with his crest em-
blazoned thereon. Pity it was that the motto,
viz., “ You will get on better by licking than
kicking,” was not pasted on it also, for such was
the kindly advice tendered to a deputation which
waited on a certain telegraph high official to have
gome necessary evil remedied.
A “ Promising 1 ” Bishop.
“Nolo episcoparil”— “ l am unwilling to be a
Bishop is the glaring tergiversation with which
a bishop begins bis episcopal ordination and gains
the elevation so really desired by him. As ho
begins so he finishes, as per example given by
Bishop Moorhoxjse, Three months ago only we
find him telling his Church assembly; “When I
give up the work of the diocese of Melbourne, I
never mean to undertake any other office in the
Church of Christ. If I go home again, as I very
probably shall in a short time, I shall do nothing
but give assistance where it may bo needed.”
These be plain words that have hut one mean-
ing. If you or we uttered them we should, as
conscientious, honourable beings, feel bound
by them. We now find what these words
are worth when uttered by Bishop Mqorhouse.
Profane people will ask, if ho values his promises
so lightly, what can be thought of his belief in the
truth of his teachings? “All for a handful of
silver he sold us—all for a ribbon to stick in his
coatl” We laugh at Benedict's lame excuse that
when he “ promised to die a bachelor he did not
think he would live to be married.” As we laughed
at Benedict, we suppose that we must now laugh
at the Bishop, and, is Figaro says, “hasten to
laugh in fear that we might otherwise have to
grieve. And now fof a charitable word to finish
with—for charity covers a multitude of sins. The
Bishop may feel that he will he a batter man and
Bishop with a seat among the peers, with the big
Sees of York and Canterbury and London in pros-
pect, and the handsome present pay. Becky
Sharpe, as Thackeray tells us, declared that
she could have been a much better woman on
£3OOO a year.
M. Monoelon, the New Caledonian delegate, sub-
mits to the Vice-President of the Colonial Council
a long paper in reference to the transportation of
reoidivlstes to New Caledonia.’ After describing
the national advantages of life in New Caledonia,
he insists that the translation of criminals to such
a place is bestowing a premium on crime. In
Prance there are numberless men of unstained
character walking the streets unable to get work.
Government will not undertake the expense
of shipping these to the distant El Dorado.
Why not? M. Monoelon asks. We repeat,
why not ? These honest men will be kept starving
on the streets of Paris, Marseilles, Bordeaux, and
elsewhere until dir© necessity drives them into a
breach of law, and all the time Government stands
by, giving them no help to better themselves
while they are honest, but when they lose their
honesty paying their expenses to a beautiful and
fruitful region where work is light and food abun-
dant. This is a new reading of the recidiviste
question, and there is much in it that gives the
political economist cause to consider.
President © revy.
Francois Paul Julbs Grew, whose re-election
to the Presidency of the French Republic has,
within the last few days, been notified by cable,
gram, Is now 78 years old, having been born in the
Jura on August 15th, 1807. Educated at the College
of Poiigny, he afterwards engaged in the study of
law and was duly admitted as an advocate. He
played a prominent part in the Revolution of 1830,
and gained considerable fame subsequently by
undertaking the defence of members of the Radi-
cal party who were prosecuted for alleged political
offences. In 1818 he was appointed Commissary of
the Previsional Government in his department,
and was elected to the Assembly at the top of the
poll for his native Jura. His political platform
was then one of independence, and he usually
voted with the extreme Left. On the 17th Febru-
ary, 1871, M. Gr5vy was elected President of the
Assembly then sitting at Bordeaux. Although his
tenancy of this position was characterised by much
ability and moderation, he resigned in 1873, still
retaining his seat in the Assembly, to which he
was re-elected thrice subsequently. Upon the
resignation of Marshal M'Mahon in 1879, he was
elected President of the Republic for seven years,
receiving 563 votes as against 99 recorded in favour
of General Cbanzy.

The Wharf-Labourers’ Strike.
LABOUR (to Capital): "ORDERLY? OF COURSE. SINCE THESE SHACKLES WERE KNOCKED OFF, WE CAN MOVE AS STEADILY AS YOURSELVES.”

Otenviiuv 0 Bud and Davies were returned lor
“nlie, Henry Bell for Ballarat there was
more osculatory, than devotional, exercise in-
dulged in, and more promises than prayers offered.
Even the holy and right reverend Samuel cannot
place much confidence in legislators who, in spite
of prayer, are returned on kisses. The Lord never
interferes with Victorian legislation. The Oppo-
sition always has a big say over there.
A reporter of the Melbourne Herald in-
terviewed a captain of one of the intercolonial
steamers, the other day, with a view of obtaining
his honest and unbiassed opinion about the wharf
labourers’ and seamen’s strike. The captain in-
formed him that the strikers had no chance of
victory—and did not deserve it. The shipowiers
would not give in, he said—they could afford to
lay by. Then he added—whether in a spirit of
grim humour or not It is bard to say, seeing he
belongs to a class of men who are not proverbial
for brilliancy of wit—this curious remark: "I
know some of the prosperous members of com-
parties who can go la for a spell without feeling it
in the slightest—men rolling in money; men who
simply now invest their capital in this way purely
to afford wages to a crowd of labouring men, and
prevent themselves from getting the gout."
Sweet Mosesl Isn’t this delicious? The dear,
good, soft-hearted philanthropists I They in-
vest their capital "purely to afford wages to a
crowd of labouring men.” They never look for
profits—not they. They find sufficient joy in
knowing that they are laying up treasures where
the moth does not eat nor the rust corrupt. It is
passing strange, however, that with all this large-
hearteduess—all this pious and noble generosity—
they should prefer to let their ships rot in the
water and risk plunging whole communities into
poverty rather than give—though they are “roll-
ing in money’’—these same labouring men whom
thev are so tenderly fond of another threepence
an hour. The captain who gave his views to the
Herald man is, no doubt, a first-class hand
at nautical reckoning, but he la on a bad
lee shore with his mental anchors dragging
when he is persuaded into posing as an
authority on problems of Labour and Capital,
because, after making the statement commented
on above, he said, in the next breath, that the
shipowners would not give the increase of wages
asked for by the wharf labourers, because if they
did so they would not leave themselves a sufficient
margin of profit on their contracts. This is a
beautiful corroboration of his previous statement.
It shows the philanthropy of his employers in its
true colours. But, after all, he oould hardly he ex-
pected to speak otherwise. He has to live, we
suppose—or presumes he has, which amounts to
the same thing—and is naturally annoyed at this
action of the wharf-labourers and the seamen, fpr
if the ships are laid up no captains will be re-
quired. And then, of course—in his opinion-
chaos.
Time after ail is the one grand test. WonrE’S

Strange are the freaks of the angels of
death. Last week’s Argus records the death ef

the same time, the one at Ballarat and tbe other at
Kilmore. Death never discriminates. Our Bene-

Henniker, in thanking the electors for

point the finger of scorn Canterbury will never be
the haunt of the coward and the traitor, but the

Curiously enough, Canterbury happens to be a
place which for years and years was disfranchised
on account of its corruption. It also happens to
be the heart of English Anglicanism.
The eccentric Lady Rolle, who has just

churches, that he might hold evening service
there. “Evening service! ” exclaimed her lady-
ship; “pack of nonsense! Just an excuse for a
parcel of fellows and girls to go to church in the
dark. If you can’t give them as much religion as
they want while it’s daylight, I’ll get somebody
else.” The mild curate blushed to the roots of his
hair and fled.

Samuel Wilson s daughter. Can it be that Cairns
is showing the old man round and dragging him

We read that some opponents of Lord
Salisbury raked up and used against his party in

speech of mine made nearly 30 years ago. when I
was 28 years of age. I knew nothing of the Jews
myself in 1858, aad spoke on seond-band infor-
mation, which was who ly misleading.” Humph!
When he was 28, Lord S ilisbury was a Press writer
and, therefore, he must have k :o wn a lot about
ths Jaws. Probably he gut his “ second-hand ”

The Sydney Globe says that but for the
kindness of a brother governor (Sir Henry Loch,
we suppose) who financed the little difficulty. Lord
Augustus Loftus, the late Governor of N.B.W,
would not have been able to leave Australia at all,
“as a determined creditor, scoffing at the privil-
eges of rank, had resolved to.hold him by a c« re.”
The Globe is wrong in so far that Gussy got help
much nearer home. Several well-known Sydney
men put their hands in their pockets. Tnis, we
may observe, Is not irreooncileable with the
prettv-well authenticated story that a leader of the
N.S.W. bar gave it as his professional ooinionthat
Governor Loftus couldn’t be arrested so long as he
held the Queen’s commission.
Bob Whitworth has written a story in
rhyme, “ The Stockman to his old bay mare.”
Considering that Boh doesn’t know a bay mare

Two of the concluding lines run thus:—
“ A precious pair of duffers, we are smashed up

Some year or so ago a St. Kilda Congrega-
tional minister resolved to become a medico. He
would prescribe for the body instead of the soul,
and to that end he states that he attended medical
lectures for two years in Melbourne. He then
got six months’ leave of absence from hU pulpit,
and departed for America returning thence with
the diploma of a Philadelphian college creating
him a full blown doctor. Dr. Danne, as he then
styled himself, was sternly refused registration by
the Medical Society of Melbourne, and made some
hubbub about it at the time. It now appears that
he practises upon the quiet. One of his patients
has died, end the coroner considers that Danne,
who attended her, should have called in a “duly
qualified doctor.” It is probable that the reverend
would-be doctor may hear more of it.
Captain Humphreys, a gentleman well
known in Melbourne Press circles, died the other
day. He was considered a fair hand at sketch
writing, and published a volume entitled “Boot
and Saddle,” descriptive of frontier life in South
I Africa, where he gained his commission in the
Cape Mounted Rifles. We have met Captain
Humphreys in the street a few times, and on each
occasion he was looking into a shop window. We
mention this fact not because it is of any great
importance, but because it is all we are able to
contribute of our own knowledge to the biography
ot the deceased gentleman. So they all died out,
one by one, these men of the pen. We will pro-
bably die ourselves one of these centuries, and—
the parson and the Potts Point plutocrats will
dance fandangos over our graves. But till then
they will have to dance for our amusement while
the Devil playa the bagpipes.
When the youthful Earl Dudley pays us a
visit it is to be hopad he won’t g« away without
seeing Auntie. Our old friend, Lizzie Munro, pro-
fesses to be sister to the still beautiful Countess of
Dudley, and is naturally anxious to take her dis-
tinguished young nephew to her arms once again.
The Earl will find his maternal aunt much altered
from of yore. Rum has played havoc with the
caste of Yere de Yere,” and the other day, when
“ Lady ” Munro appeared at the Melbourne City
Court, she appeared very dickey. No one to look
at her ladyship in the dock (drunk and dis. as
usual) would imagine that one of her sisters had
married the richest Earl in England, and another
sister had lugged the Princra of Wales into her
divorce suit. We certainly do hope that young
Dudley will contrive to renew acquaintance with
his alleged aunt. He will then be able to under-
stand how narrow a line divides a proud and
haughty London beauty from a Woolioomooloo
syren, A bottle of rum makes the whole world
kin.
One morning last week four larrikins, one
of them armed with a revolver, tried to stick up
the Hoddle-street (Collingwood, Melb ) branch of
the Commercial Bank of Australia. Mr. J. W.
Hill, the manager, made a rush for his official
shooting-iron (which, as usual, missed fire twice),
a struggle ensued, and the would-be robbers,
scared at Hill’s resistance, made off. During the
melee Hill fired his revolver at one of his assailants
but missed him, and at that Instant Mrs. Ravens-
croft, the bank-oaretaker, hearing a noise, came
rushing in at the door, received the ball in her
temple, and was killed on the spot. Which once
more shows how uncertain a shot the average man
is with the revolver. Some day, perhaps, we shall
witness a conflict, at 20 yards distance, between a
somewhat inexoerifcnoed highwayman armed to
the teeth with pistols and an able-bodied citizen
who, otherwise unarmed, has at his back a good
heap ot road metal. We thall lay 10 to lon the
road-metal. If you are scuffling with a burglar,
don’t point your Colt at his forehead. Aim at his
. knees and you’ll hit him in the ©ye.
Lieutenant Greely, of the ill-fated Arctic
expedition, has proved to his own satisfaction
that the Garden of Eden was at the North Pole.
If it was really in that slippery region, we need'
not wonder that our first parents fell. We had
always been under tbe impression that the location
of Paradise was out Woolioomooloo way, but ws
won’t anger the ladies of that locality by saying
why we thought so. Somehow we don’t quite
catch on to this new idea. In such a clime fig-
leaves would form a very imperfect chest-pro-
tector, and a snake be like the legendary demon in
a snow-pit, “ rather out of his element.” We can
only accept the Greelian theory on the supposition
that Eve’s tempter was a seal, and a sealskin
jacket the bribe. This explanation would account
for the power of a sealskin jacket over the female
mind, which is one of the social phenomena of tho
present day. If we could make sure of it, and
discover any writing of the period—a scrap of
Adam’s diary or a letter from Eve to one of her
married daughters, preserved like New Zealand
mutton in ice, we might arrive at what we feel
certain was a fact, that the old original Adam was
the first Baron Heton.
Poor Queen Mercedes of Spain—’little
Alfonso's first wife-was cruelly libelled by the
Melbourne Herald last week. The unfortunate
girl would rise from her tomb if anyone were to
call her attention to the erudite historical Herald
leader on “A Troubled Future.” It was about
Alfonso’s eldest little daughter. The Herald
man, after diving into the remote past with a
reference to the inevitable Mary Queen of Scots
(what a friend that woman has been to journalism),
goes on to tell us that “little Mercedes, the
daughter of Alfonso's first love. Is now Queen of
Spain, with her step mother as Regent.” Ah, a
little knowledge is a dangerous thing. The
Herald man had read somewhere that Alfonso’s
first love was named Mercedes, and he artfully
concluded that the little Princess, bearing the
same name, must be her daughter. As a matter
of fact, young Mercedes is the daughter of
Queen Christina, and hasn’t got a step-mother at
all. It was Christina’s wish that baby should be
christened after her predecessor, in Alfonso’s
affections, in order to please the Spaniards, and
prove that she was net jealous of the “ p >or dear
thing ” who had departed. But we haven’t yet
mentioned the awful imputation conveyed by the
Herald’s misstatement. Pretty Mercedes, that
“first-love,” had been married less than five
months when she died. Spain must be an excep-
tionally fertile country in the eyes of some Mel-
bourne journalists.
The following, from
the Kentish (Canter-
bury, Eog.) Gazette,
will interest many beside
Sydneyites: "Mr. Charles

day evenings, is a well-

nist, and he is a captain

teers. He was formerly

the men of one of the
companies which, when
In the Soudan, was com-
plimented by Genera 1
Graham. He married a
daughter of Captain
Towns after whom

niker and Charles both

man to point the finger
of scorn at him. Mr.
Heaton had, no doubt,
distanced many competi-
tors in the race lor
wealth and honour, and
it was from that source

tion in gaylng as an

Mr. George Harris, of Newstead, Brisbane
(Q.), saw a snake near his house. Bearing in mind
the Scriptural promise, that the heel of man should
bruise the head of the serpent he placed bis foot
on its body. The reptile resented this familiarity
by colling round Ueorge’s leg. A. H. Brown
seized an old sword and cut a few of Mr. Harris
toes off, and the snake, gliding up the side of an
adjacent building, listened with a highly amused
expression to Brown’s apology as he explained
that he had aimed at the reptile. Mr. Brown was a
visitor at Newstead. He has since gone home, and
Harris wouldn’t step on an old rope bow for board
wages. By the way, George Harris used to be a
leading member of the Legislative Council, and
was reckoned the finest looking merchant in
Queensland. We hope that the loss of his toes
will not injure his countenance. A. H. Brown is
also a M L.C., and a good fellow. But he is no sort
of good as a chiropodist, it seems.
The Brisbane Weekly News guys Sydney-
ites thuswise:—“ The account of the reception of
Lord Carington at Sydney sounds most ridiculous
to Queensland democracy. It is certainly rather a
comical feature to imagine an ex-Premier, a very
tali man, with soectaoles and a bald head, having a
contest with the Mayor, who is a powerful, burly
butcher, as to who should be the first to
kiss the vice-regal fist.” Then, after slating Ihe
grovellers to the tune of about 20 lines,
our exchange says of the order of C.M.G-*
for which ic alleges New South Welshmen have
a great fondness, “not long ago this decora-
tion was bestowed on a wealthy liquor-seller in
Sydney, who is certainly not distinguished politi-
cally or in any other way except by his money •
And when the C.M.G. came, it was translated as,
‘Corner of Market and George streets.’ That 18
where the whisky mill was I” Whom can they
mean?
Failures often prey too much upon the

We file our schedules then, instead of committing
suicide. Only lately we met an old shipmate ot
ours who migrated hither 33 years ago. He was
homeward bound, not with a fortune, but again to
seek it. His friends had, ho said, set him up in
business three times, and he was going home to
seek such support for the fourth time. Not ot
this sort was young Yuille, who lest week blew
out his brains in Melbourne's Western Market. He
had failed at photography, and for a change tried
highway robbery. Here again he was foiled. None
of those he stuck up had any money worth men-

failures, and then turned against htmself the

Mr Archibald Forbes, in one of the Lon-
Snn papers, gives a new version of the death of
•“The Prince Imperial.” He alleges that Prince
f niiis Napoleon was not shot when he was seen
£?H.t go his grip of his horse and fall backward,
hntthat the holster band which his right hand
hPid as he strove to spring into the saddle, broke,
and his consequent fall allowed IPs horse to escape,
and left him to the mercy of the Zulus. The
Sinister band, instead of being made, as it should
have been, of solid leather, was a wretched sub-
stance resembling brown paper. “And so in a
fonse ’’ says Mr. Forbes, “It was not the Zulus
that killed Louis, but the shoddy rascality of a
arm of Woolwich saddlers.” Mr. Forbes’statement
all in favour of Lieut. Carey, who was howled
nut of the English army by the sycophants and
tnadies of Imperialism, who charged him with
nnwardice in deserting the Prince; whereas it is
niain enough that it was simply a case of sauve
mii veut. There are not in England any more
nromlnent loyalty-crawlers than tioae who con-
tract for army supplies. Possibly some of the
voices loudest in condemnation of Carey—who
has since died a miserable death in India—belonged
to men who had themselves already profited by
the r» scanty which caused the death ot the Prince.
The latter, anyhow, is much better out of the

A truly touching spectacle was John
Alexander Dowie in the witness-box at the Mei-
bom e City Court, giving evidence against the
tailor who bested him out of £3OO five years ago.
The recollection of the old days when the Dowie
family thought they had a saint m the artful
tailor, but were cruelly disappointed, seemed
almost too much for the Rev. John’s feelings. It
appears that Dowie pere originally got hold ot this
wicked young tailor, and sent him along to son
John in Sydney. It was not for a long while that
the Rev. John had the least notion that his young
friend was a man of property. All at once the
saint announced that he had come into
£3lB 000. Unfortunately, the money was all in
London and New York, Then It was that
the Christian charity ot Dowie obtruded it-
self. His young friend was in need of the
“ready,” and he—John Alexander—would play
the Good Samaritan and advance him £3OO.
In return John received a promissory note for
£4oo—nothing more. Certainly, the young man
signed a deed of gift for £31,000, but that was not
for Dowie personally. The £31,000 was a gift to
Dowle’s “ Church,” please understand. However,
as Dowie pathetically explained, “it has never
been paid/’ Neither has the promissory note.
Poor Dowie thought his money and his man had
gone for ever, when one fine evening he ran right
into the arms of the tailor who “ had ” him five
years ago. And where ? Where should a Christian
pastor tumble against a fellow who had over-
reached him In a money lending transaction?
Why, at a Salvation Harmy “all night with Jesus.”
Hallelujah!
Australia loses intellectually by the depar-
ture of Bishop Moor house to fill the See of Man-
chester. Theologically he had his party, and to
his party he was a tower of strength. They were
safe from foes furnished with the ordinary
weapons of Scriptural warfare when they got
themselves well down on their knees behind his
broad back. The only danger to be apprehended
was that after he had beaten off the foes he might
fall backwards and crush his friends to pulp. But
Australia generally knew him and liked him, not
for hia theological diversions, butforthee;evation
of his intellectual conceptions and the spirit of
generous humaoitarianlsm his public conduct
breathed. He was one of the few prominent men
in Australia capable of uttering their thoughts in
periods. There was a rich freshness of diction in
his speeches which captivated the mind of
musical build. There were a fervour and
glow in the Images he created which kept one
looking as well as listening. He was strong, pas-
sionate, Intense, dating in invective, but never
vulgar. We have seen him in the treatment of
his theme come to the edge of that test of intel-
lectual tone, and though his sally was headlong,
he instinctively shot to one side and left the
opponent whom he cou‘d not knock down without
butting him with a gutter term, live till another
time. About twelve years ago it was our lot to
listen to Dr. Fraser, the late Bishop of Manchester,
in Georges Hall in Liverpool. At that time Dr.
Fraser stood in much the same light to English-
men that Dr. Moorhouse stands in to Australians.
He was liberal almost to the verge of hetero-
doxy. He valued theology only to the extent
that it could be made a lever to lift humanity.
Dr. Fraser was called an orator, but his
oratory was not of as high a class as that of
Dr. Moorhouse. An analysis of the difference
between Lord Derby and Gladstone, or between
Burke and Chatham, would suggest some of the
qualities in which the two classes of oratory differ.
Australia is badly in need of a lot of men like Dr.
Moorhouse, and in that cense it ia a pity that he
quits. One thing occurs to us here as a reminis-
cence. The point Dr. Fraser most pertinaciously
insisted on throughout the course ot bis episcopal
life, and which Indeed was a prominent feature in
his discourse on the occasion leferred to, was that
the sign manual of the possession of the Christian
spirit was the open-handed giving of charity to
the poor, help to the struggling, comfort to the
sad. Bishop Fraser s * ill was opened the other
day and it was found that he had left £84,000 in
cash behind him!
A B.F. paper remarks 41 The death of
Vanderbilt 11., at the age of 64, leaving 180,000,000
dollars ail invested in Government and other sate
interest-bearing bonds, and in centrally located
New York real estate property, suggests a line of
interesting reflections. If American laws permit
the foundation of a ‘family’ upon the basis of
wealth, the question will naturally present itself,
what is to be the effect growing out of its vast
accumulations as time roll? on, and how will the
fortunes of such families affect the institutions of
the country, and will the result be for good or
evil ? Within the memory of the present genera-
tion Cornelius Vanderbilt, a poor boy,
catcd, ill-clad, and barefoot, rowing a boat for
clams on Staten Island, doing odd jjobs, advances
himself by industrious toll to the ownership of a
ferry, then to the proprietorship ot a steamboat
and railroads, till he dies, able to leave to one son
40,000.000 of dollars. This son, at 40 years of age,
was toiling on a poor farm from which he grubbed
a hard living, till he was called to his lather s office
to accept toe inheritance which the bard and
grasping parent could not carry over the Styx
to the unknown sbore-npt even enough to pay
the Immortal ferryman the penny which classic
story has fixed upon as his fee for transportation
of the dead and this man dies at the age ot 64
years, leaving to the eight heirs of his body one
hundred aul eighty rai l o v B of dillara. That
father and son led a lit© ot hard and oppressive
exactions to the poor whom they employed; that
they were unloved and unlovable within their
own families; that all human sympathies had died
out of them; that they died unregretted and left
but beggarly crumbs to certain narrow charities
that gave evidence of no broad sympathy—it is
not our intention to discuss, nor our purpose to
consider; but whether the two Vanderbilts who
have passed away, and the eight who are left, are
to found a family, which shall go on accumulat-
ing its millions as time moves on, is an interesting
subject for reflection. In the absence of laws of
primogeniture and entail.it was believed that a kind
Providence would send to every family enough of
Incompetents, imbeciles, and profligates to distri-
bute the accumulations of their capable ances-
tors; but if the wisdom of the Astora, Vander-
bilts, and other great millionaires can defeat the
operations of law and the providence of God by
carefully devised wills that shall transmit their
accumulations along the family line, it is time for
organised society to consider whether laws should
not be enacted to guard the world against being
eaten up byits financial monsters. We have made
a calculation for the third family of Vanderbilts,
and found that, if it shall be as capable, as indus-
trious, as provident, as hard and selfflsh as the
founders of its race, and enough shall escape the
lunatic asylum and the home of the inebriate to
take the bequest, in another 40 years, from a four
per cent, investment, with semi-annually interest
reinvested at the same figure, the family estate
will amount to $877,788 000. There is one pleasant
outlook, for we may reasonably hope that In 40
years this sum will exceed our national debt,
when a simple act of Congress being passed to
confiscate the Vanderbilt estate will relieve our
country from all financial embarrassments; and,
assuming that the family is not more prolific of
sons and daughters in tne future than it has been
in the past, only 64 unfortunate rich people will
suffer to avoid a great national evil. Napoleon
destroyed old families and provided against the
formation, of new ones by the simple provision of
his code, that when any one died his property
should be equally distributed to his heirs. The
English place a probate tax upon the estates of
deceased persons, which we may improve by ad-
ding an ascending scale of penalties, letting the
poor man through the gateway of death with a
nominal toll, but unloading dead millionaires of
such amounts as we think will be burdensome to
them in climbing the golden ladder, and embarras-
sing for them to explain to Saint Peter that their
millions were honestly come by. We will resume
the consideration of this interesting subject when

A N.Z. coroner made a small fortune out
of inquesting a certain corpse. A man was found
drowned in the Shotover River, and an Inquest
was duly held on him. After the inquest the body
was buried near the banks of the river, and a
heavy flood sent it on Its journey down the
stream. A second Inquest was held, and the same
verdict returned. The body was interred for the
second time, but it was not allowed to remain la
peace, as a heavier flood than the first washed it
cnee more into the river. The coroner wanted io
inquest it once more, but the local medico firmly
stated that he “ had already held two post mortem
examinations upon that body, and wouid not
touch it again.”

CURATIVE BELTS
ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY.
HEALTH WITHOUT MEDICINE.
Is obtained speedily and permanently by adopting
the safe and never-failing remedy of the new mode
of treatment by Electricity, as supplied to the
human system by wearing the MaGNET ICAL
ELECTRIC APPLIANCE CO.’S genuine ELEC-
TRIC BELT, a restorer of impaired vitality and
failing health. It is an unvarying success in the
cure and alleviation of Rheumatism, Indigestion,
Lumbago, Sciatica, Paralysis, Epilepsy, Constipa-
tion, Nervous Debility, and the numerous ailments
consequent upon living in a semi-tropical climate,
and the baneful effects of malaria, which alone
are caused by the deficiency or abstraction from
the body of the all-pervading element of llfe-
electrieity. This mode of treatment is by far the
most perfect and successful method yet discovered
(combined with perfect safety) for supplying to the
body the continuous or Imperceptible current of
electricity, without the aid of chain bands or use
of acid, thus giving no inconvenience to the
wearer. They are charged ready for use, and re-
tain their full power for a considerable period.
But to avoid any disappointment by their possible
loss of electric power, and to keep the appliances
up to their original strength, we undertake to re-
charge any of our appliances at the expiration of
twelve months, free of cost. One of the special
features of this treatment is the electric corset,
which is unsurpassed by its curative properties in
all female complaints, and is of superior shap i and
manufacture. Price, 10a. and 15s.
GENT’S ELECTRIC BELTS are manufactured
expressly for tropical climates, of superior mate-
rial, in the shape of a riding belt, and are very
durable. Price, 155.; special power, 30s. In order-
ing size of waist outside first garment is required.
If mailed, 3s. extra. Lung Invigorators for the
successful treatment of all lung complaints,
hitherto without the domain of Electric Agency,
price 30a. All who have a tendency to weak lungs
should adopt this treatment before it is too late.
The appliances are adapted for local as well as con-
stitutional treatment in the form of Knee Caps,
7s. 6d. each ; Spine Bands, 10*. Insoles—which are
Invaluable for cold feet, defective circulation,
rheumatism—4s. 6d. per (pair. Send size of boot,
or paper pattern of inside ; postage, Is. 6d. extra.
The public are warned against worthless imita-
tions of our goods, as the great success attending
the adoption of this mode of treatment has in-
duced other people to attempt, by so-called cau-
tions and notices, to mislead the public. Therefore
be careful to see that all goods are marked

centuries-old subject —“ W.P.H.: Any book-
seller in Brisbane or Sydney would relieve your
trouble “ J.F.H.”: Very interesting—to Mrs.

your matter as to make a man out of the
average curate .“Tineas”: Held over —the Are

looking at its gills. A fortnight ago we saw a stale

Michael Angelo who is responsible for the Sydney
Post Office carvings “ Censor” (Paddy’s River):
Your letter shows that you don’t understand the
law of libel. If we were to say that a certain
member was always drunk that would be true,
and yet be a libel. If, however, we stated that he
was always sober, that would be no libel, although
as mendacious as the yarns about kangaroo pup
that “got poisoned last summer.” “S.S.”;
Isaiah and sewage, the Bible, and Botany reser-
voirs—what are you driving at ? You claim that
the pollution of the water supply is the fulfilment
of prophecy. Your friends should see that you are
not allowed to go loose without a collar and muzzle.
“ J. 0.” (Carcoar): We entirely disagree with the
first part of your letter. There would be no neces-
sity to direct attention to Sir John Robertson’s
feebleness if he were in a private station, but
when he claims the power of controlling the affairs
of the colony, we consider it a duty to point out
that he is incapable of discharging the duties of
the position.... “A.W.8.”: Thanks. Always glad
of cuttings “ C. Green ” We know that arson
yarn is true. 986 fellows have sent it in on different
occasions. Strangely enough every sender saddles
a different J.P. with the little tale....“ Billy
Yorkey”: Thanks; but for obvious reasons we
cannot deal exhaustively with the matter...
“ Chalinltis”: Yes it was the late Hon. J. G.
Francis who refused a knighthood irom Her Most
Gracious Majesty. He said he could not see where
the honour or distinction was when political non-
entities, charlatans, and time-servers were able to
secure titles and decorations from the Queen.
“Janary” John Davies, C.M.0., M.L.A., J.P., &0.,
was not at that time appointed. Mr. Francis was
not a rabid Tory andFreetrader. He was a Liberal
Conservative and nominal Freetrader. It was he
who first made the step towards the Imposition of
protective duties in Victoria, and is regarded by
many as the father of Protection in the Southern
colony. The hon. gentleman was a pretty con-
sistent politician, and a wealthy man. It he had
been a poor man he would probably have been
a staunch advocate of Liberalism in Victoria—
“R. Conway”: It is nearly 30 years since the
famous C. B. Jones sat in the Victorian Parlia-
ment. He was Commissioner of Railways in the
M'Culloch Administration, and proved himself to
be a clever and able administrator. He is certainly
one of the best speakers and lecturers of the colo-
nies. He now runs a little Democratic paper in
Melbourne called the People’s Tribune. At
last election, he was not lowest on the poll for
Ballarat West. He tied Mr. G. R. Finoham for the
third seat, and the Returning Officer-a party by
the name of Jones, who “ bosses ” a local bank—
gave his casting vote in favour of Mr. Fineham,
who has to thank his opponent’s rich namesake
for his seat and £3OO a year since. The Argus and
Age, and other quidnuncs, seem to regard it as a
foregone conclusion that Mr. C. E. Jones will be
elected for Ballarat at the approaching general
election, and when he does enter Parliament
again, he’ll be sure to make things pretty lively
there. Southern senators want rousing up badly...
“ Martin Robertson ”: We will try...“ A Radical ”:
Yes, we noticed it, but owing to pressure of affairs
had to let it pass “F.M.S.”: Thanks. Have
used par “Ignotus”: It would be impossible
for us to do as you suggest. Such a “ correspon-
dence club” could only succeed with a limited
number of members ...“ Democrat North”: Al-
ways glad to hear from y0u....“A.8.C.”: The
poem you write of is probably irrecoverable. The
mechanical Improvement you suggest has given
us much thought, and is still being pondered
“W. Carlton” (Coffee Palace, Sydney): Your
letter does not establish a single fact, except that
you lack sense. Were we to publish it an action
for gross defamation would lie against us. We
will hand it to the person you impugn, if do
not withdraw your request for publication “Ig-
norance”: We never said that G. A. Lloyd is
Honourable within the limits only of the colony of
N.S.W. We merely pointed out that he is not an
Honourable elsewhere. The distinction and the
q ualifioation were equally the work of the Colonial
Office. No, we don t know on what principles
these things are regulated. Ask John Davies
(C.M.G.), or write to Hennlker Heaton, M.P
“MaudS.”: Will read and consider....”C.H.B.”:
The excursion shall have early attention....“ J.
Spondulex ” (8.A.): Thanks; next week.
Peall, the English billiardist, has again
been distinguishing himself in the matter of
record-breaking. In a match with North, he suc-
ceeded in making an unfinished run of 820 (3 and
840 spots), the largest break ever accomplished in a
match for money. The previous best was 739 (55
and 189 spots) by Mitchell in his match of 8000 up
for £lOOO, with Cook, at the St. James’ Hall, Picca-
dilly, on February 6 and 7, 1883.
Says a London paper“ Professor Sydney
Galvayne, the celebrated Australian horse-tamer,
accomplished on Saturday last a feat that has never
before been performed—that of throwing two
horses at once, single-handed, and in almost a
moment, neither being able to rise. Also, in
breaking-in, riding, and driving a colt in less than
60 minutes; the owner’s man riding it home (a
distance of 13 miles) as tractable and obedient to
the bit as any old horse.”
Ithaca, N.Y., has turned out a pugilist
who intends to try and win the championship.
Me rejoices in the name of Mike Conley, and is 20
years of age. His dimensions are as follows:
Chest (skin), 461 n.; waist, 38%1n.; forearm, 14%in.;
biceps (near shoulder), 6ft. in stocking
feet; weight when not in training, 16)6it,; trained,
list. November 37th, Mr. Hayes, a noted sporting
man of Ithaca and backer of Conley, called at the
office of a sporting' N.Y. journal, posted £3O, and
left the following sweeping deft:—" I am prepared
to arrange a match to meet any man in the world
at cateh weights, according to the rules of the
London prize ring, and light with small gloves for
the sum of £3OO a-slde. The contest to take place
within three months from signing articles of
agreement, and Kiohard K. Fox, the proprietor of
the Pomes Gazette, to be final stakeholder,
select the battle-ground, and appoint the referee.
I have instructed my backer to post a forfeit of
£3O with Kichard K. Fox, which he has complied
with, and if any of the many heavy-weight
pugilists are as anxious to arrange a prize ring
encounter as they pretend to be they will cover
my backers, and name a time to meet at the
Police Gazette office to arrange a match, for I
am certain I can whip any man in the world ac-
cording to London prize-ring rules.— Michael C.
Conley.”
Low Ad Valorem Duties.
Thb following- letter has been refused Insertion h

portant in the interests of our poorer and i D( j,
trious das?, I prefer to pay for its insertion In t/

Can it be that both object to be styled impartial
“ (To the Editor of the ‘ Herald.’)
“ Sir,—Strychnine and arsenic in homoeopath
or even allopathy, are great restoratives, and n/'
mote good health; but Jet larger doses be taf«S‘
and it is only a question of time when the natt. 1
will die from their effects. Even so withy,.? l
trade and Protection. It is quite likely the ex™
sive dose of one is killing England, while Amert
may be suffering from too mucn of the oth.
But while some medicines are applied internal!'
others are used externally to the greatest adw
tage. I think Freetrade should be taken in AiT.'
tralia internally, by abolition of all direct taxaftlT
but Protection is best applied externally bv (V ;
toms duties on our seaboard only. In 1884 vn'
allowed me to point out, on at least two occasions
in your letters from America.jthe wondertui nr™
perity of that nation-buc lately, Ameren
Freetraders have asserted the reverse. la
issue, 19th January, 1881, your American corr«
pondeot stated—’Although, for two years na«*
there has been a sensible depretslon in tommeS
business, it has affected rather profits than elth«,
wages or the value of production. The cotniw
tltionfor labour has remained sufficiently steal'
to keep the working man busy, and to absorb int
industries an enormous immigration of torei™
labourers; but it must be confessed that th.
manufacturer has made but little money.’ w 6 ii
was it any wonder that you told us— ‘ In America
where the Protectionist sentiment Is strong inth»
community, a high tariff is, on the whole, more
patronised by the working classes than the polio,
of raising revenue by taxing property.’ Again
in your New York letter of May 3, 1884
I find—* The great departments of manutao’
turlng industry, while not flourishing
they did three or four years ago, ars
fairly active, and seem able to endure the
constant decline in the prices of goods without
danger of extinction,’ On the other hand, the
American Freetrade League has just stated
1 Wages of men employed in the protected indm'.
tries and those dependent upon these tsuoh as
coal) have fallen 40 per cent, in the last 15 yeara l
I think this statement should be received cum
grano sails, as the League says nothing about ‘the
constant decline in the prices of goods,’ which
working men as consumers have received the bene-
fit of. Referring again to the important letter from,
the American Freetrade League m your issue
of 13th inst., permit mo to notice some more of its
facis. It is said—’ The United States began in
1789 a “ fair trade ” policy, and this was “ a tariff of
B Va per cent, ad valorem duties.” * It appears ‘in
1846 the highly protective tariff then existing was
repealed, and a tariff for revenue substituted
This still afforded a protection of 35 to 30 per cent
on all the principal manufactures. In 1857 thin
tariff was again reduced by one-fifth.’ Mark this
to from 30 to 34per cent. Now, this was gradually
increased, and enormously so In 1864, and re-
mains substantially in force. Perhaps it it
not to be wondered at, the attempt to
reduce the existing enormously high tariff,
as it is stated, ‘the increase of general weath,
measured by assessed valuations, went on at a far
greater ratio during the low tariff period than
ever before or since.’ Mark again, the low tariff
period was from 30 to 34 per cent. Protection, and
the American Free-trade effort is, not to abolish
Protection, but to run it on the low tariff lines,
To prove that England made a nrstake in not sub.
stituting a moderate duty for the objectionable
sliding-scale Corn Law which was abolished, I
refer to J. R. M'Culloeh’s Commercial Diction,
ary. I find at page 435, ‘A duty may be equit-
ably imposed on Imported corn for two ob-
jects—that is, either for sake of revenue, or
to balance any excess of taxes laid on the
agriculturists over those laid on the other classes.'
At page 431: ‘ We are ready to admit that, had it
be'en practicable, we should have preferred see*
ing this great question settled by the adoption of
a measure for opening the ports under a fixed
duty of five shillings or seven shillings a quarter
(eight bushels) on wheat.’ You said on 13th in-
stant:—‘lf it be once admitted that high duties
areinjurious.it will be difficult to contend that
even low duties can bo beneficial.’ *lfa 75 per
cent, duty on pig-iron does harm in the United
States, it would not be likely that a 5 per cent,
duty would do good in New South Wales.’ Well,
have I not already cited Free-traders’ facts and
opinion to the contrary ? But a 5 per cent, art
valorem duty here might be so small as to have
the same effect towards Protection, as one drop
of Nux Vomica or Arsenicum to a sick person, and
that is only in the imagination. 5 per cent, would
certainly not be protection, but it might be pre-
paring the way; and show that if all round, and
thus imperceptible, while affording considerable
revenue; if more was wanted. 10 per cent, might
then be protective as well as fiscal. And so thts
Homoeopathic treatment to our country would be
beneficial in a fiscal and protective way combined.
We are indebted to your impartiality, for reprint-
ing on the 15th instant, a statement of ‘the New
York correspondent of the Economist,’ and I
commend itto the serious consideration of our Go-
vernment, Parliament and people generally. ‘Th®
National Freetrade Conference lately held at
Chicago, has attracted wide attention. It is the
largest gathering of that character held in this
country since the war, and marks a distinct ad-
vance on the part of the largely unorganised
low tariff believers in this country. . . . The
Conference also demands a simpler classification
for levying duties, the abolition of m»xed duties,
and the substitution of ad valorem duties, as least
burdensome to the class of goods consumed by
the mass of the people.

on Saturday night we resumed the seat re-
the Koyal on the steps. Nellie Stew-
were glad to see. has quite recovered the use
her two toes. As a gatherer of fire wood, however,
la not a pronounced success. The few chips
!h«’d managed to secure after a whole morning’s
lionine might boll a thimble, but certainly not a
foiicenan. It Is strange how people will some-
finies go miles to look for fuel when nothing but
o few palings separates them from their neigh-
hniir’s wood heap. How can persons ever expect
m rise in the world, and marry into Royal families,
if fhev let such opportunities pass ? With the ex-
neotion of the weapons possessed by the Sydney
r ancers, we do not remember to have seen any
more cruel-looking things than the spears carried
hv the Prince (Docy Stewart) and his attendants
when going to chase the wild boar. Suggestive as
they were of blood and ruin, they caused a per-
ceptible shudder among the children near us. Still,
it is not unlikely that if a wild bear saw them, he
would just look round for a stump to sit upon and
laugh. We are not prepared to bet upon a wal-
laby but we will gladly back a paddy-melon to
un-end the hunters and eat their weapons. You
could pick out the Prince at once, by the way he

The Stewart sisters rightly divide the
largest share of the applause. Docy is plump,
presentable, and painstaking. She has a pleasing
voice and plenty of “go.” Nellie also—although
as a kitchen wench her back hair looks a trille
tousled and her face as if it had but a bowing ac-
quaintance with soap and water—makes a seduc-
tive princess. We should like a closer inspection
of the glass slipper and then of her feet, just to
see how she manages it—but, perhaps, it is as well
not to be too curious. The humour of Greville
and Lance Lenton is chiefly confined to affording
frequent opportunities for inspecting their under-
clothing. Miss Kelton is a useful flunkey with
whose digestion and bearing a little setting-up drill
would not disagree. As a tutor, Mr, Daniels is un-
like anything we remember before in that line—
we’ve been in it ourselves. Mr. John Forde appears
more given to alcohol than domesticity. His sing-
ing we’ve heard equalled in Milan, as the Baron's
page, Mr. Wallace secures a good deal of attention
and deserved acclamation. But his voice is not of
the highest order. If some other arrangements
could be made by means of which Sam Keenan, or
even George Labertouche, warbled from the roof
while Mr. Wallace twisted and made faces, we
believe a much-felt want would be met. Of the
demons we have already spoken. If those in the
next world should prove all like them, we fail to
see the necessity for constantly praying to be de-
livered from them. A child with a toy trumpet
would put all Hades to flight.

The redeeming point about this panto-

numerous children who will, no doubt, visit it, we
must protest against the profanity which is the
crying evil of modern stage representations. The
very first scene is described on the “ Blasted
Heath in Witchland.” Surely our language is not
so short of adjectives that this objectionable one
need be retained? Now, if the adapters would

‘•Queen’s Evidence ” is the latest thing they have
struck. It is hardly necessary to observe that
this is an Impossible play, consisting of an incon-
ceivable plot, containing incomprehensible situa-
tions, and including in the dramatis personae some
superlatively Improbable characters. The Ust of
incidents reads like the catalogue of crimes at a
Quarter Session, and some of the dialogue like the
brighter conversation of Tarban Creek. When
“ Queen’s Evidence ” was last played here, it was
remarkably popular—with those who liked it. It
is so still. On the floor of the house the habitues
rarely concern themselves with any considerations
of the unities, and applause from that region is
constant and prolonged, And in the circle, during
the more touching scenes, the display of cambric
and silk was affectlngly lavish. “ I have not had
such a good cry since Flo died,” observed an
elderly matron, whose performance in the water-
cart business had been especially energetic.
“Flo,” we afterwards discovered to have been her
pet poodle,
♦ * *
“Queen’s Evidence” was written for
Isaacs, and Isaacs was made for Johnny Hall.
We have never been able to discover what was the
author’s exact intention regarding the cha-
racter of Isaacs. The present exponent shows
us a villainous Israelite, with a heart like
a pumpkin—a Jew who runs through the
whole calendar of iniquity, and then at the
proper moment throws off all his villainy
with the same nonchalance with which a
N.S.W. Minister abandons his political prin-
ciples; an amusing Jew, yet one lacking in the
depth, stolidity, and shrewdness of his race. With
Mr. H. N. Douglass as Gilbert Medland, we were
not pleased. His voice falls at the end of each
sentence with the monotonous regularity of
Bunny Corner Silver shares, and throughout all
his lines we seem to detect a here-endeth-the-
second-lesson refrain, which made us grieve that
his slaughter in the first act, by Isaacs, or some-
body, were not part of the business. Nor do we
think the Matthew Thornton deserving of un-
limited "jam.” That perpetual and leery grin
does not usually adorn the face of a consummate
scoundrel. We would like to see Mr. Baker in some
more reasonable and consistent character. Young
Sherwood was a natural boy, and managed his
voice cleverly.

Maggie Knight brought down the house
by her powerful acting in the shooting scene.
She and hubby quarrelled so naturally that the
performance directly appealed to every man and
woman in the house who knew what it was to
hear the whizz of flat irons and the crash of
crockery in their little four-roomer. Maggie, in
the first scene, is busy in the kitchen, and our
universal knowledge enables us to point out
several little inconsistencies in the business.
Firstly, we might remark that it is not usual to
Put away the breakfast things until they have
travelled through the washup-dish, and, further,
We never saw a laundress run her finger over an
iron to And out whether it was not enough. Of
course. Miss Knight is too refined to test the
warmth of the implement in the usual vulgar way.

The “Green Lanes of England ” still draws
a good many married couples to the stalls of the
Gaiety, and a good numoer of tow-headed men
in their shirt sleeves to the gallery. By the latter
section of the public a feu-de-joie of Insultingly
Personal remarks on the appearance and idiosyn-
craoles of the actors is kept up. It is singular what
a “down” an ordinary gallery has upon vice—
Particularly when the iront seat is occupied by a
tipsy sailor. Anything in the shape of violence to
a female—whether she deserves it or not—is re-
lented with proianely-expressed disapproval. So
lon# as our seamen continue to mix so much
virtue with their bravery, so long will Britannia
rule the waves.

The manner in which old Martin Wheat-
stone (Mr. Holloway) denounces his only child
(Myra Kemble) should be seen by any unforgiving
rather who has a grown-up daughter of whom he’s
desirous of getting rid. But Myra is a tough one
to get off your hands. She objects to die, and
carries her point. She is a favourite with the
audience, but—it may be fancy—we sometimes
thought we detected a slight expression of levity
on her features—especially when her father's fury
is running over and he is standing In the slop. Bill
the Slogger, too (Mr. Stark), in spite of his mouth
and week’s beard, is held in general respect. But
if the black-eyed and demonstrative sailor-man in
the gallery on Saturday night had got his hands on
the monster Flint (he hung about the stage door
waiting for him when the piece was over) another
artist would have been required for Monday’s
representation.

At the Alhambra a change of programme
is presented. The burlesque is withdrawn, and
the usual variety entertainment is now given. Cap-
hin Campbell introduces his talking figures.
They are all wooden heads, and, like the ordinary
run of legislators, they say a good deal which
means very little. Probably, after a lew week’s
run at the Alhambra, one of them will be contest-
ing West Sydney. There is no great difference
between a candidate for Parliament and a ven-
triloquist’s dummy. Each has his speeches made
for him, and the questions and answers are ail
readied no. Miss Minnie Hope, as a hybrid
masher, with more handkerchiefs in her pockets
than we have in onr wardrobe, warbles
the Masher King.” If Minnie can use the
potatoe masher as well as she abuses the
woman masher, her dinners must be choice.
Matlock’s song of the “Tress of Hair,” we know.
Last week a tress, or a hair of auburn hue, ap-
peared on our sleeve as wo entered the boudoir in
which our wifa was seated. Two minutes subse-
quently we had a Jump on our cranium which
nature never established. W© had collided with a
volume of “Dark Days.” We are thankful it
wasn t the “ Complete Shakespeare.” Miss Amy
Kowe’s “Madeline ” was a sweet and satisfactory
performance. In response to a request from a
Chinese gentleman in the gallery, named Hong
Kore, Miss Rowe repeated her solo.
The performance of “Mother Goose” at
the Olympic on Monday night was spiritedly
given, the comely nymphs prancing and romp-
ing about the stage like a lot of potato-bugs
skirmishing away from the front of a horse-hoe.
The creatures processed as they have done each
evening for three weeks. There are about fifteen
Centuries, the woeful ancient Briton olad in leopard
skins and melancholy, with long down-streaming
hair, being first to appear, after which follow our
Anglo-Saxon, Norman, French, and other pro-
genitors, even unto the times of John Davies,
uM.G., inclusive. Then the Centuries dance.
There is a peculiar feature In the pedographical
performance. The ancient Briton, most of whose
terpsichorean efforts were probably confined to
climbing trees as she chased the gray gerfalcon’s
wounded prey.from limb to limb, steps the same
measure as the 19th century lady. The whole is a
local adaptation of a minuet of ages,
and a mixed minuet at that.

Miss Ida Francis is a vision in long hair
and loveliness arrayed. She doubles the part of
Mother Red Cap and Mother Hubbard, and is
charming in both. She has not much to say, but
she has a lot to look, and she looks it. Queen
Tiddyiddy (what a name for a Queen, even of
burlesque) had a little black spot under her nose
(Miss barony’s nose) the first night of the show,
and may we be compelled to Jive on gruel forever
if it isn’t there yet. And there are nearly 5000
tons of soap made in N.S.W. annually. (Oh I
beauty spot, is it?) Well, it’s there. We don’t
know all the other young ladies. Some of them
have very big parts-the parts they kick with,
Tom Ma'one was in with us on Monday night,
and he opined that if their speed was in pro-
portion to their muscle, properly trained they
could break records. We offered to book a small
bet that the majority of tnem without training
could break crockery when family jars were pre-
sent. Tom wouldn’t bet. He’s you know.
Miss Ida Osborne deserves a good line, and she
shall have it if it has to go in as an advertise-
ment. To her much of the success attending the
pantomime’s production is due, and from the
public, as from the management, she deserves a
kindly acknowledgment.

Sydney Grundy’s comedy, “The Glass of
Fashion, is the new bill at the Melbourne Bijou.
Society journalism was professedly satirised in
this little work, and Its original production at the
Globe was peculiarly distasteful to Edmund Yates
The genial Edmund considered himself to be per-
sonally affronted by Sydney Grundy. It Is pro-
bable that Grundy had considered himself to be
personally affronted by the Would on some pre-
vious occasion, and wrote his comedy out of pure
malice. An unfavourable critique on one of his
earlier Plays may have caused all the trouble
Dramatic authors suffer from the same weakness
as do ladies and gentlemen of the “ profession
an unhealthy appetite for “ butter.” The sort of
journalism which moves them to laughter by its
airy sauciness and melts them to tears by Its un-
affected pathos, is—a good fat “ notice.” Anything
else they despise. This accounts for the proles-
sious predilection for certain papers. Nosy, If
any misguided author were to write a play con-
taining sinister allusions to The Bulletin, an
Australian company would steadfastly decline to
have anything to do with it. And how have we
attained our present popularity among the pros. ?
By systematically beslavering plays and players,
Irrespective of merit. It is quite open to other
journals to follow our example and adopt Grovel
as their watchword. If the editor of the World
but properly buttered Mr. Sydney Grundy,
the Glass of Fashion ” would never have re-
flected its author’s spleen.
* * *
The “Glass of Fashion” is a shilling
From what we could see of it at the
a Pp eared to be a two-page publication,
which hasn t yet attained the dignity of a wrap-
-9? uncommonly dear shilling’s
worth. The outside sheet is adorned with the
portrait of a fashionable beauty, and the rest of
the paper is devoted to chronicling her move-
ments, and so forth. The editor of this organ
prowls about with an open book In search of
materials tor society ” copy. In the first act we
round him pursuing his literary labours in the
house ot a rich brewer, Mr. Macadam. Dazzled
o m enjoying unlimited paragraphs
ail about himself and his furniture (not to mention
free ads. of theflrm’s unrivalled beers), the brewer
is tempted to become the proprietor of the “ Glass
of Fashion. We were not surprised to find
that he repented of his bargain. Some of the
pars., read aloud, were altogether so depressing
that we felt convinced the “Glass” must prove a
fizzle. The readers are all supposed to threaten
the paper with libel actions, and Mr. Macadam has
to buy them off. The idea is too preposterous,
buch a dreary production must have killed the
readers with its first issue. The artist for the
shilling Glass ’is a bogus PollshiPrlnce, who, take
it altogether, treats “ fashionable beauties ” very
I'/ 1 ’ 81 h® wins all their money at cards,
then he links their names with his own in com-
promising paragraphs In the “ Glass,” and finally,
as a masterpiece of cruelty, he sketches their fair
faces for the next week’s issue. The wife
°£. a certain Colonel Trevanion comes worst
?,!,* After losing a thousand pounds to
P rince at euchre, or poker, or some
other society game, she is Innocent enough to pay
a visit to his studio. Foolish Mrs. Trevanion is
then in the bad man’s power. He calls her atten-
tion to a paragraph in the “ Glass’’—one of Ms
own—which not unnaturally distresses the poor
lady; he kisses her, and he sketches her. The two
last are equally hasty operations. Both take in-
side two seconds by a stop-watch. Fortunately,
the sketch is never completed. The bogus Prince
falls into the hands of the police, Mrs. Trevanion
forswears innocent flirtation and comes to a pro-
per understanding with her husband, the brewer
renounces his literary venture, and the minor
characters pair off happily. What becomes of the
editor is not quite clear. We fancy he becomes
London correspondent for the Sydney Morning
Herald.
* • •
Such a flimsy plot as this requires strong
interpretation. Speaking generally, the acting is
very good, Mr. Dion Boucloault, fils, plays the
Polish Prince in a style that nearly makes us for-
get he is too small for the part. Unfortunately,
Mrs. Trevanion is a lady of more than the average
height, and her behaviour in the Prince’s studio
is altogether inexplicable from a commonsense
point of view. Instead of fleeing from her
foreign admirer she ought to have boxed his ears.
In a fair stand-up fight between the pair it would
be a pony ”to a pin on the lady. Miss Trevelyan
possesses the necessary physical qualifications for
the ‘ fashionable beauty.” Perhaps it is the
author’s fault that she appears somewhat inno-
cent and fresh. Mrs. Trevanion seems too artlefs
altogether, considering that she undoubtedly
plunges at euchre, and presumably waltzes with
the Prince of W s. Mr. Titheradge is excellent
as her gallant hubby, who returns from potting
Zulus at Korke’s Drift to find his wife has been
distributing 1.0.U.s and flirting with a card-
sharper. As the husband of a lady who has pre-
sumably waltzed with the Prince of W s, he
gets the sympathy of everybody in the house
Miss Boucloault trips daintily through the
pretty part of the “beauty’s” sister. Mr.
Hans Phillips enjoyed the beatific privi-
viicge of gaining her affections. By the way,
either Miss Boucicault or Miss Trevelyan was
favoured with a nice bouquet on the night of our
visit. An enthusiast in the circle seized the happy
moment when nobody was saying or doing any-
thing to hurl his floral tribute at somebody on the
stage. The Lord only knew whom it was intended
for. It landed violently against the side pillar, and
lay neglected near the footlights for the rest of
the evening. We believe the stage oat ultimately
devoured that bouquet. But to resume. Mr.
Brough is funny as the brewer who buys the
Glass.’ We should imagine that the author had
never seen a Bass, Allsop, Guinness, or Meux
when he created a Macadam. Mr, Brough inter-
prets Grundy’s ideas and gets the best laughs ef
the evening, but he isn’t a bit like a brewer. Mac-
adam is supposed to be a beer-king, an M.P., and
the husband of a countess. As played, he is just
as unreal a personage as is the uncouth Joint
Stock Company promoter in “ The Parvenu.” Miss
Watt Tanner is particularly good as the brewer’s
high-born wife, and Mr. Herbert Flemming does
his best with the impossible character ot the
editor. Many better comedies than the “ Glass of
Fashion ” have not been half so successful.
Last week we referred to a religious
lunatic who goes around with chalk, marking
chapters in the Bible on walls, pavements, people’s
doors, shutters and other places. He has recom-
mended a whole lot of chapters for perusal, and
now it is our turn. Suppose the man with the
chalk turns up chapter xxvi. of Proverbs, and
takes a spell at it himself. Most of the advice in
it will just fit, and if he should find it just a little
personal it won’t be our fault, we didn’t write it.
If we had it might have been a trifle stronger.
The people flocked to the Gaiety on Sun-
day night to hear Joseph Symes tell how he be-
came an Atheist. The doorkeepers say they
turned away hundreds. There we sat sweltering,
while all the time there was lots of roam in the
churches; it was comparatively cool and lonely in
those tabernacles. We dare say had we distributed
ourselveslamong these mausoleums of a moribund
creed we should have had a whole pew each, and
nothing to pay for it. But we wouldn’t go even
at that price—we preferred to pay our shillings,
our sixpences to hear Symes, to gaze on Bright, to
be tickled by Feuillade and Co., ana to catch cold
on coming out. The mention of Bradlaugh’s name
was received with an outburst of applause,
heartier than any that ever welcomed the
Governor. Jos will he succeeded at the Gaiety by
W. W. Collins, who arrived ou Wednesday under

Gentlemen,— One application of St. Jacob’s Oil,
well rubbed in, cured me of a severe attack of
rheumatics in the right shoulder and arm. On a
former occasion an application of this valuable
oil cured me of a similar attack in the hand. I
know of many instances of cures being effected
by this remedy where others have failed. One was
the case of a fireman on board one of the A.B.N.
Company’s steamers on the Queensland Coast, who
got a severe strain in his side through lifting a
heavy mass of coal. I bapppened to have a bottle
of tJt. Jacob's Oil in my portmanteau (in fact I
never travel without it), and got permission to
apply it, with the result that the man was able to
resume his work next day. You can make any
use of this testimonial you please.—Yours truly,

“A child two years old fell out of a rail-

when the train was crossing the bridge, but

mistake of the paragraphist. A Parramatta train

that rapid rate of transit would never cause a

Every man to bis trade. A Congregational

Much-suffering Sydney is afflicted with
another curse—the bagpipes. Her “Highland
Regiment,” now being formed, is to have eight-
and-thirty pipers, even if it has but “four-and-
twenty men,” which reminds one that that “aris-
tocratic” corps, the Sydney Lance-ahs-whose little
aim it is to fill the place occupied in more civilised
countries by the “Household Cavalry’’-has 30
men and TOofflcahs. The scream of the bagpipes
as been defined by Leigh Hunt as “ a tune tied to
a post.” When we heard the bagpipes (they are
practising already) snorting out slaughter im the
Wharf Labourer’s procession last Thursday, we
thought of the old Highland piper’s recountal of
his Edinburgh experience. “Ahl there was ae
mcht Id ne’er forget. There were 18 pipers be-
sides me in Mrs. Grass’s wee back parlour, in Cow-
gate, an’ we were a’ playing different tunes, an’ I
list thocht I was floatin’ in heaven.”
A terrible vehicle catastrophe was averted
the other day.” So a N.S.W. up-country paper.
Its readers may or may not know that the writer
means a buggy accident did not happen, but as 1
his paper circulates mainly amongst the bucolic
beef-eatersofarivertown it is probable they do
not. This man would describe a cat killing a I
mouse as an “exciting encounter between an
enraged feline and a terrified and desperate
rodent ; and a lightning flash as a “ raging battle I
ot the angry elements, while ever and anon
through the sundered clouds poured charges of I
the electric fluid, which Illumined with a yivM
brilliancy the whole of the darkened heavens, and
away in the distance the sullen roar of the dying I
thunder announced to a wondering world the fact I

Unassuagable grief mingled with righteous

diurnal luncheons. At noon, or half-past, baskets I
were opened, and the contents despatched under j
cover of a friendly desk-lld; so that by 1 o’clock
the foolscap-spoilers, like giants refreshed, were
able to sally forth and do the Block, or to have a I
quiet game of pyramid pool, or transact any
little business on hand in the hour set apart I
for the mid-day meal. But last week, to
the consternation of the small fry among
the Phlllip-street Tito Barnacles, an order was
Issued, requesting gentlemen not to commence
luncheon in the office before 1 p.m. The day I
following was marked by a tragic incident. One
too-sensitive youth opened his sandwich bag at
12.4 a p.m., solemnly and deliberately got outside I
of half-a-dozen home-made sheep’s chitterling I
pies and a slab of cold plum pudding before 1
o’clock. Then he bid a tearful farewell to
his brother clerks, and, seizing his luncheon
knife, cut three inches of frayed material from I
the edge of his paper collar, and started off to do
the Block as usual.

He had died in the night, and was only

The road to patent-medicine fortune is
strewn with wrec&s. Probably in no other indus-
try has so much money been squandered. A re-
cent writer says that “not one article In a thous-
and succeeds, even when backed by generous
capital,’’ and one ot the proprietors v> rites:
“ Within the last 20 years not a single medical pre-
paration has been put upon the market, backed by
however muea of capital and experience, or how-
ever excellent the preparation, that has yet
escaped from the limbo of uncertainty, and can
fairly be pronounced a success.” To succeed, a
“ proprietary ” medicine must be what it is adver-
tised to be. All the “ proprietary ” mixtures that
have been successful have been genuine remedies,
perfected by years of study. Many are com-
pounded from prescriptions by eminent doctors,
and hav® been proved by experience. They have
ministered to a pressing need. I'hey have filled a
v icant place. Many mixtures of undoubted effi-
ciency have failed because their places were
already filled by tried favourites. Borne have
been unsuccessful, no one knows why—fate
has been against them. And an enormous
number have failed from insufficient adver-
tising. Testimonials have done good work,
especially from persons of title. An English
quack made a contract with an impoverished
nobleman named the Earl of Aldborough that for
£OOO a year, the earl was to be afflicted with what-
ever diseases his patron chose, and to certify that
he had bean cured by his auack nostrum. The
contract was faithfully carried out for years. The
earl lived in ease In Sicily, and the quack made a
fortune in London. Each year the world said to
his wife, “Look here, the Etrlof Aldborough
writes from bis retirement la Sicily, that John
Smith's specific is a perfect cure for rheumatism.
I must try it—an eari wouldn t Jie.” So the medi-
cine flourished. When Mrs. Langtry arr.vtd in
New York she observed, artlessly, that ic was easy
to make money in toe United States. Only a few
days after her arrival, sue was paid £l6O for signing
her name to a testimonial on behalf of a soap for
the complexion.

Great excitement has been occasioned by
the disappearance of Constable Ryan, who has
been stationed near Sandhurst (Vic.) for the last 30
years. The people have turned out to look for him.
The same feeling of excitement is occasioned in
Sydney by the appearance of a policeman in any
except the main streets. The people all turn out
to look at him. There is nothing wonderful in
Ryan doing the disappearing trick; any “trap”
can do that. If he doesn’t turn up this side the
cemetery, his friends will find him keeping a pub.

Rarely doth a peeler die till he’s kept a pub., and

Twang the harp, let music sail, strike the tin-tank

my children, shout halloa;
That’s why we should make a noise. Rise it,

But a fight just then broke out, such a riot, such
a shout, soon we saw that peeler go. Was he
slow ? Not much—oh, no I
Down the street he ran with speed, caught a ’bus
but missed the deed. Was the woman killed ?
Oh, no—nearly so, though; nearly so.
Must have gone to Sandhurst, eh ? Skipped back
overland, we say; won’t be killed in fight, you
know. Not that sort ? You bet, oh no.
But we’d like to see a trap once a month or so
mayhap, when they’re nothing else to do.
Wouldn’t you, now, wouldn’t you ?

Governor of N.S.W.? Any man can govern “ the
Mother Colony of the Australias,” so long as he
owns horses. Any jockey could do all the govern-

even believe it could be done by any donkey.

The Shoalhaven News states that Mr. E.
De Mejtre, the well-known sportsman, has decided
“to dispose of the whole of his farm and stud in
April next, including 60 mares and several sires.’*

the other impedimenta of jockeys and trainers, a
few mares and sires. Whoop 1 Pegasus:—

He’s selling his stud off,
He shakes racing’s mud off,
But the “scent of the stable” must cling to him
yet.
We think of his racing,
We see bis nags pacing;
No weeds in his stables, all “figs” none were
“tares,”
Now, learn from the News man,
A kind of diffuse man,
He includes In his stud a few horses and mares!
We are glad that the News man the fact boldly
notes,
Else we’d thought perhaps the stud was of donkeys
or goats.

There is one young doctor in Melbourne
between whom and the Board of Health there is
no love lost. He was summoned the other day for
a paltry sum of 505., owed to his wine merchant.
A distress warrant was issued, which was returned
with the grim sarcasm in Latin that the young
Bsculapius was, from a financial point of vlew f
“no good.” The Bench thereupon ordered the
amount to be paid forthwith, otherwise a promis-
ing physician would spend seven days without
being able to read the obituary column In the
newspapers. The ordinary mind would fancy
that he should have been able to borrow the
amount of the bill from the nearest undertaker,
with the agreement that the latter should not be
forgotten when he (the doctor) got his next case.
But the fact is that coffin constructors put no trust
in young doctors. The reason of this is that young
•doctors—unless they are very long-headed indeed-
«nter upon their profession with too much enthu-
siasm They wish to save the lives of all
their patients, instead of allowing a sufficient
number to pass away to the better land
to allow a margin for the men in black. The
latter, therefore, will have nothing to say to them
till they begin to get experience, and learn upon
which side their bread is buttered. They all learn
this sooner or later. In the meantime they are
frequently summoned by vulgar tradesmen. By.
the-way, Melbourne Is stiff with hungry young
healers at the present time, all of whom are as
eager on the the track of a ease of whooping-cough
or measles as a threehalfpenoe-a-line man on the
Gifted Winter is after a fire or a fatal accident.
And a small army of medical students is being
drilled In the University to swoop down like a flock
of cormorants—there is some confusion of meta-
phor and simile here, but we were never very par-
ticular—on the devoted city. What they will all
do unless an epidemic or plague of some kind is
sent to their deliverance, the Lord only knows.
Some may be able to maintain themselves in
modest luxury, and study the results of their pro-
fession at the same time by taking to gravedigging,
but the majority will in all apparent likelihood
have to go forth and break stones or lump coal on
the wharves in times of strike. It is a melancholy
fact for beginners In medicine to have to face, but
there it is—people will not get sick, or if they do
they send for old stagers in the profession or
doctor themselves with “ herribs ” and whisky.
We were speaking the other day to a medical
gentleman who had come out from England with
the most irreproachable of diplomas and the finest
of clothes to make his fortune In the colonies. He
settled in one of the most fashionable suburbs of
Melbourne, took a neat house in a good street, had
his name engraved on a brass door-plate, and sat
down to wait for a rush of business, “ And did it
come?” we enquired. “Cornel” he replied; “I
was there two months before I got a call.” “ But

you got It at last,” we said, sympathlslngly. “Yes,
I got It—oh, I got It without a doubt,” he re-
marked, with bitter irony. “ And what was the
case?" we asked. “What do you think?” he
roared; “by heavens, sir, It was to prescribe for a
sick goat I”

“It was the greatest pride of his life to
think that he owed his present position to the
integrity and industry of an ancestor, who had
risen from the ranks.”—Carington to the wharf
labourers.
If any man more than another now on the
surface of this gloomy globe should have been
born In the Bronze Age that man is Mr. Justice
Kerferd, of Victoria. Even the Conservative
papers of Melbourne have been compelled to
describe his appointment as a “ political job.”
Does he hide his head on this account ? There was
a banquet given to the Governor at Beeohworth a
short time ago, at which Mr. Justice Kerferd was
present. His health was drunk, and, In replying,
he said that “ he had been connected with the
Ovens district for a period of 31 years, and he
trusted that experience In the full blaze of public
opinion might be taken as some indication of his
fitness for the office he had accepted by force of
circumstances.” This Is not mere effrontery—it is
calm, impassive, Tltanie disregard of facts. Mr.
Kerferd, when he spoke about “ the blaze of pub-
lic opinion ” should have said “ the blaze of the
bar-room.” He was once a brewer—and In
Beeohworth, too. It Is not every retired brewer
who can so confidently appeal to his former cus-
tomers as to their opinion of his merits—that Is to
say, of his beer. But why he should imagine that
because his beer was good they should take It as
Indication of " his fitness for the office he had ac-
cepted by force of circumstances ”—the office of
judge at £BOOO a-year—will probably never be
known till the temb gives up his illustrious bones
on Judgment Day, If It will then.

Makers of books read this and laugh.
Writers of books read this and die. It was In the
grey dawn of the morning. The eastern sky began
to flush a warm red at the coming splendour of
the sun. Aurora—the beautiful, the immortal—
once more drove her chariot across the sky, her
rosy nymphs floating around her, even as in the
glorious picture of Guido. At this hushed and
solemn time a man came out of the Pitzroy
Gardena, Melbourne. He glanced for a moment
at the East up which the great sun-god drove his
steeds upon a path of Are. What were the thoughts
of this man as he gazed at that magnificent spec-
tacle, old as creation, yet ever new? Did he
softly murmur to himself that noble line of
Tennyson’s—
“ God made in heaven an awful rose of dawn,”
or did he satisfy himself with contemplating its
majesty in reverent silence ? The hard truth
compels us to say he did neither of these things.
He merely muttered to himself, “ It’s safe enough.
They won’t be up for another two hours yet.”
Five minutes after he might have been Seen shin-
ning up a verandah post of Don Juan House,
the abode of Mr. Joe Thompson, the friend of
Buskin and Carlyle and the pet lamb of the
Melbourne Presbytery. "Mr. Thompson,” says
the graphic paragraphist from whom we get the
kernel of this little episode, “ on retiring to rest,
threw his garments on the food of his bed, but
failed, In accordance with his usual custom, to
take the money out and place it under his pillow.”
This might have been unfortunate for Mr. Thomp-
son, but it meant special Interposition of Provi-
dence to the man who came up by the verandah
post. He clutched the clothes, and disappeared
over the balcony like a shadow. What was his
reward? The graphic paragraphlst curtly says,
“ In the pockets of the clothes was about £100.”
Think of the majestic carelessness which could
carry around one hundred pounds—two thousand
shillings—the price of four thousand drinks at
sixpence—of eight thousand at three pence—all
day, and then sling it recklessly at the foot of the
bed at night! This is the feature of the affair
which makes us say that bookmakers should read
it and laugh, and book writers should read it and
die. We remember well the last time a
burglar broke into our dwelling. He could
have walked in if he had chosen, for the
front door was fastened with string, and the
back door was off its hinges. However, we suppose,
even if he had noticed these things, he would have
closed his eyes to them and—for he turned out to
be a conscientious burglar—broken in in the
orthodox way. Anyhow, he came in. We were in
bed, but awake, and we watched hla proceedings
with a smile of unalloyed glee. He took our
garments up from the floor, gave them a shake
without raising the ghost of a jingle, and threw
them down with a sigh. Then he looked into the
safe in the kitchen, and as he did so we fancied we
could hear him sob. He returned with a light
tread into our bedroom, and softly deposited a
shilling on the chair beside us. "It will get him a
drink or two in the morning—poor devil 1” he
murmured, and, closing the door after him,
quietly departed. The next day he sent us his
compliments with a bag of potatoes, a shoulder of
mutton, and a half-dozen of bottled beer. These
presents were accompanied by a polite note
written in very pure, not to say fasti-
dious, English, intimating that a set of
house-breaking tools were at our service whenever
we chose to send for them, and hinting—very deli-
cately Indeed—that he would initiate us into the
mysteries of the profession at any time we chose,
without charging us the usual premium. It was
a most gentlemanly offer, but we were compelled
to decline it. There was too much night-work
necessary, and our constitution had never
thoroughly recovered from the shattering we gave
it when we were in the Jbody-snatohing business.
We have of ten regretted refusing this offer since—
all the more as our generous friend will not have
the opportunity to repeat it for another seven
years or so, having been persuaded to spend that
period in Berrima. But we can always turn to
politic«—now that our jaynil friend Dan is in
office—when writing for newspapers has suffi-
ciently blunted oiir sensibilities, deadened our
conscience, and wrecked our constitution. To
vlnd up, the moral of this little story is that the
early burglar catches tho bookmaker.

A hallelujah lass, over whose glorified
head the sum of 64 summers have shone, testified
at a meeting last week that “ she had read her
flible through, and what she could not under-
stand she believed.” She does not say whether
she believes what she does understand. Let us
whack the spirit-stirring drum:—
She has got religion solid,
That fair ancient maiden stolid—
She believes in what she cannot understand,
After Satan’s patient waiting,
Down the narrow way she’s skating,
And banging on the cymbals with the band.
She’s resolved to take the chances;
O’er her backward way she glances,
And sees she has the best part of her fun,
So she hedges now on sinning,
With a double chance of winning.
And she’s bound to come ‘‘ahead of it on one.”

The railway officials in New Zealand are
real smart. A Maori lady took a cheap ticket
from Fielding to Halcombe. She was alive when
she took the ticket, but before arriving at her
destination the unlucky lady was—as the parsons
put it—“no more.” When the train pulled up at
Haloomhe, there was trouble; the ticket collector
wouldn’t pass the corpse unless she paid the excess
rate for being a dead ’un. “Did she book as a
body ?” said the guard. The other Maori ladies
were bound to admit that deceased had never pre-
pared for emergencies. “ I can’t let her through
the hairier on this ticket,” said the guard. Alto-
gether it was a nice point, but It was finally decided
that anyone who buys a railway ticket as a live
un is entitled to die on the journey without
paying extra. Evidently, though, the New
Zealanders are keen business people. We have
seen more than one fatal case of heart disease
brought out of a railway carriage at a London
terminus without any difficulty being made. The
officials were so Indifferent to the Company’s in-
terest that they never asked the deceased for any
ticket at all. By the way, speaking of that, wo re-
member a gentleman being assisted out of a first-
class compartment at Waterloo. He was evidently
dead, but the porters thoughtfully propped him
up in a chair on the platform and attempted to re-
vive the poor gentleman. A gruesome spectacle
It was. But we were unregenerate in those days,
and kept frivolous company. An irreverent vil-
lain at our elbew whispered that the limp figure
in the chair looked “ like Henry Irving in the last
scene of ‘ The Bells.’ ” The wicked suggestion was
a grand tribute to the great actor’s peculiar art of
depicting death,

Mr. Booth, the Grand Panjandrum of the
Harmy in Australia, made this statement in one
of his addresses delivered lately Alcohol Is no
respecter of persons, It will knock down a bishop
as quickly as a chimney-sweep.” Setting aside
the irreverence of the remark, it shows that Mr.
Booth knows exceedingly little about bishops.
Why, the average bishop would—if he choose to
lay himself out for the business-be just in the
middle of the fun and able to go and preach a
better sermon than ever he did, when the average
chimney-sweep would be getting the usual 34
hours’ for having been found with his head under
a footbridge and his feet in the gutter. The rela,
tive cubic capacities of each is to be considered,
Two ordinary chimney-sweeps might be packed
inside an ordinary bishop without swelling him if
he had lived as well as the traditions of his office
demanded. We reckon a bishop, if he liked to
try, could stand up to the aeok in a pile of bottles
he bad emptied into himself and still call for
another case.

As humble admirers of civic dignitaries, it
warms the very cockles of our heart to mention
that they are about to give yet one more proof of
their public spirit. A little bird whispers that, on
the occasion of our Gracious Sovereign Lady
Queen Victoria’s jubilee, petitions will be for-
warded to Windsor Castle from the Corporations
of Sydney and Melbourne praying that the chief
magistrates (Heaven bless ’em) “ may assume the
title of Lord Mayor, the same as the Mayors of
London, York, and Dublin.” Directly the rumour
reached this office we sent round to the Corpora-
tion to solicit the favour of signing our cross to
that petition. We wished to sign on behalf of the
Australian people. Our request was declined with
contumely. They only wanted the signatures of
aldermen. No matter. This rebuff shall not pre-
vent us from singing to the Australian people;—
Good gracious 1 turn your heads away, we cannot
help but swear,
To think that our chief magistrate is merely Mr.
Mayor,
While the citizens of London, York, and Dublin
do accord
To aldermen who "rule the roost” the title of “ My
Lord.”
Shall this enlightened country bow in silence, and
submit
To such a degradation? O, confound it I Deuce

Shall a people who in England’s cause have volun-
teered to fight
A horde of goats and Arabs longer suffer such a
slight?
No, no; the times are altered—we are not what
we have been;
We used to be contented with a country and a
Queen.
But since our minds expanded, we are breathing
mighty prayers
For new and fresh distinctions—namely, titles for
our mayors.
Speak out, O fellow citizens! the moment is at
hand;
All hail! the reign of grovel In this happy
Southern land.
We fought and bled for England; It were but a
just reward.
If one, at least, among us be promoted to My
Lord.

kins, Jones, or Brown,
And (if the Q ueen will let us) stipk his head Inside

Then hand him up some turtle soup, a jewelled

And bend the knee before him, and address him as

It was a touching scene. The gloomy day
flung raindrops the size of shillings, and now and
again whoppers as big as eighteenpence, against
the windows of the wide high room, in an alcove
of which King Alfonso of Spain lay on his dying
bed. The physicians no longer concealed that the
end was fast approaching. Some in the room
dropped on the rich pile carpet tears nearly as big
as the shilling wets dashing againt the glass f
while 13 or 14 others, whose venerable faces and
stately forms told of the gallant Don Juan vic-
tories of 30 years ago, emptied out great big
saucer-like globules that brought the average tear
fully up to the size of Is. lid. Gloomy as was the
day, it was still gloomier in the royal sick-
room. Wiping his eyes with the tall of his
soutan, Cardinal Benarides detached himself
from the cohort of wallers, and entered
the alcove. For a while there was sobbing
without, sobbing within, and then the alternation
of whisper with whisper. It was known that the
King was making his confession. "Howlong,”
sobbed the Queen mother to one of the physicians,
" did you say he would live ?” Only a few
minutes,” replied the reverential phial. The
Queen mother thereupon entered the alcove and
whispered in the Cardinal’s ear, " Get him to con-
dense, Cardinal, or his soul will scoot. If he die un-
shrlven, he will never meet me or the other mem-
bers of his family ’tother side of rainbows. He's
my son, and if he must particularise he’ll never
live to get through.” The Cardinal was a practi-
cal man, and although it went against his grain to
save a soul except on the usual terms, he assented
here, and took the confession by sample. Not a
minute too soon. The king’s soul made a plunge.
The alcove was now penetrated by the cohort of
wallers. Tears went up as high as ss. The poor
wife clung to the body in the bed, the
poor children cried aloud. But the special
grief that history should take note of, and
which the death-bed of the tramp and the
beggar is almost always without, was introduced
by Isabella, the Queen mother, laying her hands
on the king’s neck, and saying, ‘‘My son, my
son I” The King opened bia livid parched lips,
and answered, “ Father, Father 1” The It stately
forms, with the facial lineaments of Don Juan,
hearing Alfonso's murmur, in a passionate
outburst of uncontrollable affection flung
themselves on the bed, and embracing the
young man, said, “Son, son, we are here; we
are here!” Wo said it was a touching scene.
Leave out the natural accompaniments of all such
sad occasions, and conjure up a vision of the Car-
dinal dancing around in a cyclone of maledictions,
of Queen Isabella clothed with confusion as with
a mantle, and of 14 venerable courtiers winding
28 long arms around the nsok and shoulders of
Spain’s dead monarch, each under the impression

Part I.
When by my flickering: fire I weary sit,
The day’s work ended, and a respite given
Till morning 8 light to sudden rising hopes;
Rising, alasl but to be beaten down
By the unkindly tale the “ prospect tells,
(For hopes delusive are the miner’s life.)
As flame-jets leaping from the boxwood logs
Call forth from darkness and display to view
The moaning shyack and the white-stemmd gum
(The giant sentries of my lonely camp),
So memory burns her faithful light, to draw
From out the darkness of the gloomy past,
The form which it was once my joy to see.
In all the clearness of the passing hour.
Ah I Linda was the bright and peerless gem
Of all who used to glad the days long past.
Though there were many others richly dowered
With ample gift of beauty, yet she rose
Above them all, as does the lofty box
O ertop those trees, which, stately when alone,
Seem but as shrubs when they grow close beside
This giant of the forest.
Yet she seemed
Unconscious of her beauty; nor believed
That she had power to sway the minds of men,
And hold them fast in silken bonds, thrice blest.
Until the fancy-fashioned links gave way,
And left the thrall in anguish when ho felt
His wretched freedom.
For as one confined
Longtime within a cell, from which each ray
Of light is close excluded, feels no hurt
Whilst total darkness meets hisstaring eyes;
But when led forth starts back in new-born pain,
As first the light strikes on his dazzled sight:—
So men may rest in quietness and peace.
While they are in deep mental darkness wrapped
By Venus round her votaries; but this veil
Withdrawn, they start to see the light which
beams
From stern Reality’s too brilliant sun.
Then vanish all the shapes which Rapture formed
To fill the void which knew not Reason’s ray:
Then vanish the delusions, and high hopes
Which made that cell a hail of happiness,
A paradise, which kings with hearts enslaved
By grasping avarice and lust of power—
Kings, who but hold their love, as though it were
A gilded bauble, by the people given.
To purchase for the nation heirs and peace—
Can never tenant.
But I would return
To that point where this long digression left
The sphere of reminiscence; and again
See Linda, as 1 once could see her, stand,
In pure majestic beauty, while she dressed
Some simple ballad in her sweetest tones;
Her voice investing every word and thought
With added beauty, until then unknown.
And so imprinting on my soul the strain,
That even now those old song-trords restore
To me,the full remembrance of the voice
That ever echoes through my aching heart.
Ah 1 she was beautiful I Her fair hair fell
In rippling cascades, or was close confined
In one bright shimmering Lacasnean knot;
Her cheek, in colour, as a fleecy cloud
Kissed by the ardent sun when first he leaps
Upon his fiery oar to course the sky;
And from her face outshone the glowing light
That spoke the fervour of a noble mind;
Her eyes,—but when did ever soulless words
Depict such lustre, which, or must be seen,
Or else be all unknown.
Who can describe
The subtle cunning force of that keen wit
Which taps the hidden fountains of our mirth ?
We seek in vain to find the potent charm
That lingers in the words, and strikes a chord
Harmonious to our passing thought and mood.
Nor can we show to one who is not blest
With gift of fancy where that humour is
Which made our mirth.
So it were vain to strive
To tell of those rich-charms, full powered to bind
Our true affection, which seh cts its lord
By instinct, rather than by Interest led.
The painter’s art may on dulkcanvas trace
The outline of an eye, but,cannot v show
The silent pleadings and mute eloquence
Which only live in the original.
We had been friends for months, before I woke,
To find myself a Liver: for I deemed
Myself not suited to that dalliance
Wnich thoughtless men call love; and so I lay
Long time unknowing of that mighty power,
Which gradually conquered my reserve.
They speak untruly who say love is born
Of love alone, and never is the fruit
Which comes upon the tender stem from whence
The petals of fair friendship silent fall
As love in embryo assumes their place.
There is a rapturous sentiment which springs
In many minds, and for a time subjects
The customed thought and wavering wanton will
To its own mad dominion.
Born upon
The graceful symmetry of some fair face;
Cradled in mantling smiles; and constant fed
With mutual interest, such flame as this
May long be kept alive; but if, perchance,
Some accident untoward should affect
The course of such a passion, love, so-called,
Is wont to turn at once to fiercest hate.
But perfect love, the love of all that’s pure.
The heart's subjection to those virtues set
Within the compass of a woman’s form,
Though checked by fate, and beat upon by time,
Will still be Lore, as long as life shall last.
Such love as this is oftenest the crown
And full result of fervent friendship, lost
In deepest adoration at the last.
I cannot now discern what time I ceased
To occupy the friend’s, and took instead
The lover’s place. But even when I knew
My happiness in Linda’s love was bound,
I could not stoop to those small arts—the jest,
The compliment, and trivial tale which pave
The paths of modern lovers. And the more
I grew in rapture, so much less my tongue
Refused to bandy words of trivial things.
Nor 18 this strange: the mind has only power
Within a certain limit, and this strength
Demanded all for one absorbing thought
The homage of reflection is not given
To any other less important theme.
Ah I those were happy days, and soon they passed
(As spring time merges into summer's glow),
To rapture fuller still, because more free
From all the shadowy boat of doubts and fears
That linger round the suitor's slippery path;
And we became each to the other bound.
In bonds fast rivetoed by willing vows.
Happy was I to meet the constant jest
That hailed the knowledge of our compact made;
For did not every witticism bear
Fresh testimony to the sweet reality
Of love’s existence ? And we were esteemed
As lovers of a bygone age; for now
It is not deemed en regie to display
Too much devotion and chivalrous thought
To the one lord who claims our fealty.
’Tis well that Heaven, in mercy, has concealed
The fortune of the future, with a cloud,
Which bides alike calamity and gain,
Else had I not a moment’s rapture caught
Prom all tb®se days which Linda sanctified—
Days which were charged with ecstaoy because
Security, with lying tongue, assured
Sublimer force of eoatacy to come.
Yes; had I then been skilled to see how soon
My joy must meet destruction, I had spent
The hour in useless wailings; nor have seen
The pleasure of the moment, in the shade
Of the impending fast-approaching doom.

Waste Paper.
Pat Daley was tbe driest man who dwelt in Surry
Hills,
He daily blended privately the juice of fifty stills;
And, though it play’d the deuce with him, still he
could never stop—
He drank his little drop until the drink caused
him to drop.
He never had the time to work, and yet it came
about,
Although he drank good porter he was far re-
moved from stout;
How ’twas he was the driest man, although his
ways were wet,
I know not—he’d the credit of’t, and thus got into
debt.
His wife, poor soul, was clothed in rags, such as
would scare the crows.
Yet bore the orew’s-foot prints upon her fore-
head, eyes, and nose;
His children ten, among the lot could scarcely
raise a shirt,
They never felt the cold, they were too thickly
clad in dirt.
Now every day the shopkeepers kept sending in
their bills—
They came in all directions—not alone from Surry
Hills;
Each morning Mrs. B. picked up a bushel at the
door,
And ere the day was done, they dunn’d were by as
many more.
She packed them up in baskets, and filled each
empty tin,
Still packets kept arriving, and the mails kept
coming in;
These constant mail arrivals found the meat for
many a meal.
In barter with the butcher, or the man who sold
cow-heel.
Like birds, through bills they filled their crops,
and Mrs. D. said that
They turned them in a pound a week, which flabber
gasted Pat,
Who shouted loud, “Our fortin’s made, we’ll soon
surmount our ills;
We’ll run in debt three times as much, then live
upon ourBillsl”
Sydney, Uth January, 1886.
A Southern correspondent writes:—“l
went last week to take a passage to Tasmania for
self and three others. The agents for the Patsena
and the Flinders were a long time filling up the
printed forms of receipt for the passage money.
When handed to me, the reason why was soon
seen. Eight lines, closely written, told me that the
ticket was Issued subject to the vessel being able
to go, as also that I must not expect to be brought
back as a matter of right. That everything de-
pended upon what the next week might bring
forth, and that the agents would hold themselves
liable for nothing beyond the return of the money.
The next day the seamen had all struck, and the
wisdom of the proviso was well justified. My wife
and daughters consider it as a ‘ mean thing * to
be thus cone out of their intended summer out-
ing, and the strikers get no sympathy from them.”
Writes a correspondent Gloomy in-
deed, in all senses, is the outlook in Melbourne
just now. With |the wharf-labourers’ strike and
the seamen’s ditto there is an unpleasant prospect
of a short supply of coals. The want of Newcastle
produce means no gas. Kerosene might be sub-
stituted if the whole stock had not been cleared
off by the two fires at Jones' storage yards. The
want of coals means stoppage to all railways and
engine work, and of all gas engines and steam
engines. Such want means also the stoppage of
newspapers and the throwing out of employ of
some hundred of thousands of people. We are, for
the future, evidently to be under the dominion of
a power as well organised as Mr. Parnell’s. The
Trades Unions of all the colonies act together,
and act promptly too. Talk of Feneration? Why
the colonies are already federated when their
working men act as they have done in this case.”
The homeward-bound are filling up the
mail-boats. No cabin is to be had at Melbourne in
the P. and O. line earlier than in the Sutlej, which
does not leave before April. Mr. Bosisto, the
M.L.A. for Richmond (Vic), and formerly its lead-
ing chemist, seems to have supplanted George
Collins Levey in the Exhibition business. He acted
as Victorian agent in the Calcutta business, and
now goes to England in a similar capacity for the
Colonial show, to be held there this summer.
Whether he will be knighted, or that honor be
given to Victoria’s nresent Agent, or its coming
one, is just the question. Mr. Murray Smith is
supposed to be tanking in England to get the ex-
pected honour at the opening of the show which Mr.
Graham Berry equally expects to get at the close
of it. The coolness of Mr. Murray Smith is con-
spicuous. Though he might have a chance of the
Premiership if he returned at once it is not good
enough to tempt him. He intimates his willing-
ness to enter Parliament only if he can be returned
unopposed and without expense I His agent has
got his nomination paper, and the question is—
What will he do with it ?
Here is something for colonial Jingoes—
who hope for Anglo-Saxon federation on an Im-
perialistic basis to chew over. The B.F. Argo-
naut, one of the most Conservative and oei tainly
one of the friendliest to England among American
periodicals, thus precasts—we think, accurately—
the near political future of Great Britain ....
“ Last election, with its newly enfranchised voters,
was but the preliminary contest in the skirmish
line of what is destined to be a long struggle, and,
when ended, a decisive victory for Republican
ideas. Widening the franchise was, for the Royal
Family and its prerogatives, for the Church of
England and its privileges, for the nobility and its
pretensions, for estated gentlemen and their
tenures of landed property, for all classes In the
enjoyment of special privileges, and for those who
favour laws of primogeniture and entail, a great
mistake. It is the beginning of changes which the
industrial, commercial, and labour classes will
alone regard as reforms. It is the beginning of a
revolution which will never go backward. It la a
concession to demands that will never cease, and
to agitations which will never end, until England
becomes in all essential principals a Republic.
Gladstone will die, and the fiery Chamberlain will
take his place. There are elements in the Liberal
party and in the Home Rule party that will
unite, because of their affinities. Whenever
England, Ireland, and Scotland shall have given
the elective privilege to all male citizens over 31
years of age, and clothed them with authority to
make and execute the laws and elect the Judges,
It will be a very short step to practical agrarian-
ism, to a division of property upon the principle of
ownership suggested by Henry George. When
every white male of the age of 21 years can vote in
England, and it is coming to that most rapidly, the
Royal family and Queen or King will be set aside.
Crown and Church property confiscated, the House
of Lords abolished—perhaps replaced by a Senate
—the laws of primogeniture and entail be re-
peated, and these will be but the first and pre-
liminary concessions of a conservatism which in a
short time will have more extreme measures de-
manded of it. When English voters who have
nothing are in majority over those who have some-
Jmlng, they will devise measures for partition.
The vast accumulated wealth of England is
a temptation which a voting proletarian class
will not attempt to resist, and when that
time comes, and it is apparently fast coming,
demagogues will stir the passions of its voters to
demand increased wages, shorter hours for labour,
declare that land is a common inheritance, and
prosperity is theft. Perhaps the future Lord
Macaulay will turn his attention to the possible
dangers that beset his country and threaten its
dissolution, and postpone the prophecy of the
earlier destruction of the laws and government of
the United States. It is possible that the traveller
from New Zealand, having perched himself upon
the ruined arches of London Bridge to contem-
plate the surrounding desolation of a dismem-
bered empire, will then cross the Atlantic, where
he may be comfortably transported over the
New York and Brooklyn bridge, seated in a steam
cable-car. The possibilities of future political
calamities within the Island empire will, we think,
justify its politicians, lecturers, writers, and
journalists in giving more attention to their own
affairs and less to ours from this time forth,'* Yes,
the British Republic will come with universal
suffrage. Which is the next big thing the Radi-
cals wl 1 demand.
HEROES OF PEACE.
Addison, happily enough, thus writes “ Troops
of heroes undistinguished die.” It is certain that
lathe daily battle of life; in that great conflict
which, even under the aegis of peace, is fought
every day, and which is so much more pathetic,
so much more terrible, than the most stupendous
struggle between the hosts and armies of war,
heroism, unseen and unrecorded, is a very com-
mon matter. It needs not the surroundings of
a bloody battle to develope the God-like qualities
which makes the heroic. In the patient suffering,
the cheerful resignation, the unselfishness, the
honorable fidelity to duty, which, thank God, are
so common as to command no surprise when
they are discovered, we behold heroism as lofty,
as worthy, as lovely and admirable as any exhi-
bited by the soldier “in the imminent deadly
breach or the forlorn hope. r
We are here reminded, that among the fighters
in the battles of peace, the engine-driver stands
forth prominently as the embodiment of the
heroic. The incidents recorded of the cool
bravery aud unselfish heroism of engine-drivers
are numberless. We read the other day of the
driver of a wrecked train, mutilated and in great
agony, in dense darkness amid the warring of the
elements, crawling along the slippery line with a
lantern, to warn an approaching train against
danger. We know how nobly the driver of the
Geelong train behaved in the disastrous collision
at the Werrlbee ; how he died comforted with
the reflection that he had done his duty, and
holding, tightly gripped in his hand, the telegram
which had caused the mischief. We have read of
the driver who, seeing a little child playing upon
Vvf* * an ? Rowing that it was impossible t">
stop the train in time to avoid crushing it, crawled
along the engine and lifted the little one out
of danger. Such stories are common, and so grow,
S? At 6 JJ nrfc flecting, to become commonplace.
But the thoughtful recognise the spirit of heroism
which resides in these narratives, and understand
how terrible is the mental and physical strain which
the engine-driver has to bear. This tax upon the
nervous system of necessity contributes to disease
and debility, and the wear and tear of energy and
health. Every sympathiser with the brave men
who thus suffer in the cause of the public, will be
glad to hear that medical science supplies a
remedy, at once prompt, effective, and permanent
in its action. Mr.. James J. Wright, who is now
editor of the Brunswick Reformer, Victoria,
testifies to this fact. He says that for eleven
years prevous to the year 1883, he was employed
in the locomotive department of the Victorian
railways. About 1881 he experienced kidney
troubles, coupled with rheumatism. He grew
worse in spite of medical assistance. He became
so bad that he had to be carried to his engine—
and here, surely, we perceive the heroic spirit of
fidelity to duty. His agonies were intense, but
he held on to his post, until at last, in May 1883,
he was forced to take to his bed. The doctors did
their best for him, but he grew worse, and began
to despair of recovery. Controlled by the con-
viction that his case was hopeless, he resigned his
post, a step supported by the statement of the
Governmnet medical officer, that Mr. Wright was
suffering from chronic rheumatism caused by
kidney disease, which had poisoned his blood.
This gentleman also pronounced the case to be
hopeless. Mr. Wright’s resignation was therefore
accepted and compensation granted. For eight
months he hobbled about on crutches scarcely
able to pass from room to room, and wholly
confined to his house. However his pluck carried
him along. He obtained work on the Daily
Telegraph newspaper, of Melbourne, and from
this circumstance traces his cure. He was sent
down by his editor to describe H. H. Warner's
safe cure establishment, then just opened in Little
Lonsdale-street West. The manager, observing
that Mr. Wright was seriously unwell, presented
him with a bottle of Warner’s safe cure, which
was accepted with that courteous scepticism with
which the Invalid, who has gone through the
“ course ”of legitimate medical treatment re-
gards all proprietary specifics. However, doubt
soon changed to faith. Mr Wright speedily found
that there are more things than are dreamt of in
the philosophy of the doctors. He kept on with
the medicine with the happiest results. He says
“ I have completely recovered my health; I have
had no attaca of rheumatism since last June nor
have I suffered from any kidney complaints,’ and
this in the face of the fact that I have worked
early and late, and necessarily, have been irregular
with my meals.’ Mr. Wright adds-” Knowing as
Ido the hardships engineers are expos rd to. the
great nervous strain, the cold, wet, heat, long
standing, and the constant jolt of the engine, I
feel lam only doing my duty in recommending
to my feflow englnemen, Warner’s safe cure and
safe pills; believing that they are honeit medicines
and capable of great good in relieving pain and
sustaining the system under the severe strains
incidents to the lives of those whose business is
that of engine driving.” Testimony stronger than
this could scarcely be given. It has been sent in
by Mr. Wright without solicitation. It is the
outcome of the very natural gratitude of one who
despairing of cure, found it by accident, and who,
lacking faith at first, has been forced to accord it
at last. It ls;the honest tribute of one who, belong-
ing to a class of men trained to suffer aud endure
only yield to the force of illness when powerless
to resist. It is the certificate of a man who
carried his ailments as one of the great army of
the heroes of peace, and who records his cure
with the simplicity of truth, and the candour of
conviction.

SOCIALS
A fashionable marriage took place on the
afternoon of Wednesday, the 6th inst., at All
Saints Caurob, Wickham Terrace, Brisbane, The
bridegroom. Mr. Donald MoDougall, son of the
Honorable J. F. McDaugaU, M.L.C., with Flora,
second daughter of Mr. Justice Harding. Bis
.Lordship the Bishop of the diocese, assisted by the
Itev, C. J. Robinson, officiated. The bride, who
came leaning on her father’s arm, was most charm-
ing, her arraceful petite figure enveloped
in a beautiful robe of pearl-white corded
silk very long square train; the front of the
skirt draped with Handsome duohess point, and
the peaked bodice, Vandyked across a full vest of
the same lace. She also wore a wreath of orange
blossoms and lilies of the valley, and tulle veil,
the border hem of which was finished with a soft
tulle ruche, and tiny sprays of the last-named
flowers. She was attended by the Misses
Emily, Rosa, Ada, and Nellie Harding (her sisters)
Miss M’Dougall (sister of the bridegroom), Miss
Lllley, Miss Hart, and Miss Yaldwyn. All were
attired alike in extremely becoming costumes of
shell-pink nun’s veiling, trimmed with cream
point d’Alenoon. Mrs. Harding (mother of the
bride) was attired In a very handsome gown of
elephant's breath satin Mervellleux, with a
drape of ficelle lace on the left side of
the skirt, caught up with pink ostrich
feathers, bonnet to match; Mrs. M’Dougall
(mother of the bridegroom) wore black satin
trimmed with cream lace and cardinal, cream bon-
net. The bridegroom was attended by his brother,
Mr. P. M’Dougall (best man), and seven grooms-
men. Among the wedding guests in the church
were: Sir Charles and Lady Lllley, Sir Ralph and
Lady Gore, Mr. Justice and Mrs. Mein, the Pre-
mier and Mrs. Griffith, Colonel and Mrs. French,
Miss Fairbalrn, Mrs. R. S. Neilson. At the conclu-
sion of tbe ceremony the guests adjourned to
St. John’s Wood, the residence of Mr. Justice
Harding, where dinner was served—the bride
and bridegroom sitting beneath a canopy of satin
and lace, on the front of which were the words,
“God bless you,” in gold letters. The bride’s
presents were both numerous and costly.

An engagement which will cause some
little stir in banking circles is that of the manager
of an Oxford-street Bank —whom everybody
thought had given up all ideas of matrimony—and
a young lady well-known in the suburbs.
• * *
The Chamber Music Society, which Herr
J. Kretfchmann conducts, gave a pleasant con-
cert in the University Hall last Monday night.
The large audience, if rather soaring of applause,
evinced deep interest in each item. Himmell’s
“ Septett ” opened the concert, and, as each instru-
mentalist was an artist, the effect was delightful.
The oboe did good work, and had plenty to do, too,
and the weird French horn was charmingly mel-
low. Herr Kretschmann and Mons. Caron helped
considerably in strengthening the choice, If small
band, and the lady amateur at the piano over-
came the many difficulties In which the piece
abounds, with as much grace as skill, A Miss T.
Atkinson made her appearance as a soprano soloist.
If the initial were F instead of T it would be more
than probable that the young lady Is none other
than the Miss Fanny Atkinson, of Brisbane, who, a
few years ago, was sent home to complete her
musical education. The young lady (if the same)
was honoured by not a few laudatory
notices In the English papers auent her
singing, and one at least predicted for her
a brilliant future. Miss Atkinson has evidently
been a hard student, for her runs and trills are
clean and finished, but the question is whether
tbe voice have sufficient body to justify the meas-
ures taken with It. A pleasant presence and per-
fect self-possession told greatly in her favour, but
power Is wanting to make the whole ouite satis-
factory. Two little mites took part Id Mendels-
sohn's trio for viola, violin, and piano. The baby
who sat at the piano was a little wonder, and It
seemed almost incredible that she could accomp-
lish anything with her wee fingers, but she dis-
played the greatest nonchalance In attacking
the part assigned to her, though by no means an
easy one. The elder prodigy—a child of about 11
years—took the violin part, and Herr Kretschmann
the viola. The young violinist drew forth an ex-
cellent tone, and her bowing showed her to be a
true pupil of Herr Kretschmann. Mr. Knight
Aston sang two tenor solos, but his voice seemed
forced and slightly out of tune. Nevertheless,
applause was not begrudged him. Herr Patek
gave a ’cello solo in finished style, and with the
pure tone peculiar to himself. A string quintette
finished an agreeable and high-class concert, upon

The Queensland B.S. Company invited a
few hundred ladies and gentlemen to a trip round
the harbour la their new boat, the Barooo, last
Friday afternoon. As everybody was socially In-
clined, the trip proved to be very enjoyable. The
Barooo Is a comfortable and well-appointed boat,
and will undoubtedly be a favourite on the line.
Captain Morris need never fear that his pas-
senger-list will make other than a good show
against that of the boats belonging to the opposi-
tion companies.

Sydney, Wednesday,
Dbar Pka,—All visitors and new comers to
Sydney express unbounded surprise at the absence
of the great desideratum in our ;social life. This
town or 300,000 inhabitants has no place for social
meeting, no neutral ground of fellowship, where
all may see or learn to know each other. What
wonder that Sydney society is a bye-word for
petty cliquism! No doubt the domestic hearth
has charms, and the citizen owes duties to his own
fireside, but why should not pleasant intercourse
with friends in the bright sunshine and the beauti-
ful surroundings of our public places sometimes
tempt him from his dull retirement? Time after
time we have heard it thrown in the teeth of
Sydney people—” You have beautiful public gar-
dens, with tbe loveliest out-look in the world, and
you leave them entirely to nursemaids and
children!” Commodore Ersklne gallantly at-
tempted to remove this reproach by com-
manding his Nelson Band to play in the Gardens
during one afternoon of the week, in the
SKETCHED AT THE LAST RECEPTION.
A HEN AND CHICKENS.
hope, that society would go and listen. But even
the attractions of a bachelor Commodore with his
gay suite, were not strong enough to rub up the
good intention. It languished and died of inani-
tion. It is not improbable had Lady Augustus
Loftus set aside weekly packets of energy for the
purpose of helping the idea with her presence,
things might have been otherwise. I say this in
no spirit of snobbery, but simply because all social
innovations must have for their main spring the
patronage and influence of the chief lady of the
land. Therefore, since we dare expect so much
from the sweet-faced lady who has come among
us for a space, let us plead—
“ For the cause that lacks assistance,
For the wrong that needs resistance.
For the future In the distance.
And the good that she can do.”
Would it not be delightful if Lady Carington in-
stituted a “ Rotten Row ” in tlie lovely drive
round the Domain 1 It seems to me we keep all
the bounties of this rich land foi r the edification

very much pleasanter If it becar ne a recognised
custom to make the Domain drivo a fashionable

there is no bounds to the future | tossibillties. It
would be a great boon to our bu sy men-kind to
know that when they left their bust Iness worries at
5 o’clock they would be sure to find pleasant
relaxation In the exchange of frien diy greetings,
or the sight of well-appointed equilpages, occu-
pied by well-dressed women; or, to become more
bold, if Sydney could once accompli! ib an open-air
concert In true Continental fashion, men would
cry with wonder: “How have we existed so long
without these simple delights? Away with our
fusty bum-drum conventionalities 1 liet us use the
cool evenings, or the balmy moonlight sights in the
enjoyment of sweet strains and enuobtiag scenes.”
Alter a ramble through our beautiful public
Gardens-beautiful and fresh even now in this ex-
hausting atmosphere,—it is pitst belief that people
can live within a stone’s throw from ser.son to
season, and yet never entar them. Unhappily
such is the case, the nominal excuse be ing the
beauty of other spots—the r eal one, tha l- , having
settled i?.to one groove, people have not energy
to rouse themselves out or It. Could any spot be
more fitted for a Rotten Row than tine Outer
Domain? It has within itself so many and mani-
fold attractions. To the equestrian, a delightful
ride. To the art lover, the Picture Gall ery on one
side, exquisite nature on the other, 1 . To the
scientist, the Technological Museum. To the
sport lover, perfect cricket or tenuis grounds.
What more would you compress int o a national
pleasure ground ? Pour moi,— onl;f a golden
thought of Emerson’s, “A sufficient, measure of
civilisation is the influence of good women.” In
other words, a perfect vitality,* that will
“ take occasion by the hand and make the bounds
of freedom broader yet.”
On Saturday afternoon last Mrs. T. 8. Mort, of
G reenoakes. Darling Point, gave a pleasant “At
Home ” in honour of the recently arrived Bishop
of Melanesia and Mrs. Selwyn (nee Miss Annie
Mort), who are here for a short while en route to
Norfolk Island, the scene of the Bishop’s labours
as head of the Melanesian Mission. It was a de-
lightful gathering of old friends to welcome
Mrs. Selwyn home again. The guests included
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Mort, Miss Mort, Mr. and Mrs.
W. B. Mort, Mr. Laidley Mort, Mrs. James Mort,
Mrs. Grace. Miss Mitchell, Judge Dowling, Sir
Alfred and Lady Stephen. Sir John Hay, Lady and

Mrs. B. Merewother, Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Manning,
Miss M. Manning, Mrs. Marsh, Mrs. Bushy, the
Misses Busby, Dr. Manning, the Misses Finch, and
many others. I believe the dresses worn were, on
the whole, very handsome, and quite in keeping
with the beautiful surroundings. Black predo-
minated, a few of the younger ladies wearing

CORRA LYNN.
The raree show provided at the Pitt-street
Congregational Church last week attracted, it is
said, a large audience. The occasion ostensibly
was a welcome to some dozen or so South Sea
Islanders on their way to New Guinea as teachers
under control of the missionaries. The gathering
reminded us more forcibly of the levee described
in “ Martin Chuzzlewit,” where Mark Tapley and
his master were interviewed by a crowd of curiosity
hunters, who came to stare at two people volun-
tarily expatriating themselves to a comparatively
unknown locality of swamps, fever, and general
misery. The conductor of the show put the half-
civilised islanders and their wives through their
facings, and after the audience had been
thoroughly sated with hymns and speeches in an
unknown tongue, and had criticised the quality,
make, and general appearance of the attire worn
by the females, the unhappy kanakas were allowed
to depart in peace.
The eyes of England are turning towards
us—as also towards our pockets. When castles
have to be sold then folks with much money have
to be looked up. Australian papers of last week
contain particulars of sale of “ Saltwood Castle
with its 500 acres of park, wood and arable land, in
the county of Kent.” We read of its attractions,
that “ the gatehouse of this fine old historical castle
has lately been restored, making a most Imposing
residence for a family, with splendid views both
Inland and seaward to the English Channel. The
castle covers three acres, a portion of it being In
picturesque ruins,” and all within two hours’
railway ride from London and 30 minutes from a
railway station. Australians are evidently thought
to be still lingering here waiting for chances to
imitate Sir Salmon Wilson’s example in setting up
in historical houses. For an Australian to live in
the “gatehouse,” or gatekeeper's house, with a
ruined castle in the background, as a show place,
should satisfy the ambition of those who, by help
of their money, wish to be heard of by their
friends at a distance.

We were pleased to see the hardly-used
Sirocco score a win for the R.S.Y.S. third-class
race on Saturday last. The course was from a

and the starter’s boat in Neutral Bay, down to and
round the club buoy at Manly, back round Shark
Island and Fort Denison, thence round lightship.
Sow and Pigs. Shark Island, and hack to flagboat
off Fort Macquarie. Two yachts competed, Mr.
w w. Knox’s Sirocco and Dr. Milford s Sao,
which had a time allowance of 3mln 33sec.
The wind blew rather black during the afternoon
from the north-east, and the Sao, with asingle reef
In her mainsail, led round the buoy at Manly, but
the Sirocco passed her in the run to Shark Island,
and gradually drawing out a lead, finished
4min. flsec. ahead of Dr. Milford s little
crack. However. Mr. Knox’s ill-luck still pursues
him, as the question has been raised whether the
Sao’s handicap was the correct one for this par-
ticular course. Yioe-Commodore Milson, who
acted as Commodore of the day, will re-measure
the course, and such measurement will decide the
race. * * *
It would seem the Association Ground
people have ridden a willing horse to death. At
the magnificent Ashiield Recreation Ground on
Saturday last, Mr. Copeland said:—“ Cyclists were
heartily glad that a recreation ground had been
formed at Ashfleld. They had laboured from year
to year against a monopoly—a monopoly which
had at last become insufferable. The Association s
was a fine ground for cyclists, but, unfortunately,
those in power in connection with that enclosure
were despotic and tyrannical to a degree. The
Sydney Bicycle Club had paid the Association
Ground £313 for the use of it for one afternoon in
last August, and had borne all the expense, and
taken every risk and responsibility. There was
great need of competition in the way of grounds.
The monopoly should he broken, and he hoped to
see the Australian Eleven play at Ashfleld in a
couple of weeks, for it would do a deal towards
the attainment of that end. The cycling bodies
would support the Ashfleld ground, and one of
the leading Sydney clubs had already decided to
hold its annual race meeting there.” £63 an hour
is pretty stiff. It would be had enough for a
ground, run purely by a money-making company,
but from trustees appointed with the object of
fostering manly sport I Bahl

The fight for supremacy between the
Sydney and Mercantile Rowing Clubs has been
carried even unto the waters of the Macleay. At
the Lower Clarence Rowing Club Regatta, held on
New Year’s Day, the senior double sculls was com-
peted for by Messrs. J. M’Kensey and J. Weekes,
and R. R. Donaldson, and B. J. Tierney, victory
falling to the lot of the first named pair. Donald-
son and M’Kensey were at one time members of
the Sydney and Mercantile Clubs respectively.
Jim M’Kensey pulled many a hard fought battle
in the Sydney Mercantile Rowing Club, and formed
one of the Intercolonial eight for years 1879 and
1880. We thought “Jim” M’Kensey bad by this
time settled down Into old pater familias, but it
seems there is life in the old dog yet.

On Saturday night, at Foley’s Gymnasium,
George-street, Sydney, a merry set-to was in-
dulged in by a number of competitors for the £lO
trophy presented by Foley. The contest was con-
ducted under Queensberrv rules, four three
minute rounds. Ryan and Johnston (coloured)
opened the ball. Their spar was very uninterest-
ing. Mulholland and Nelson followed, but the
latter, a youthful aspirant for fistic fame, stood
no show with his opponent, who played with him
to a rather greater extent than was justifiable,
There is no courage and no science in making a
show of a youthful antagonist. Nelson fought two
game rounds and retired. Meadows and Charles
Bathgate took the floor in the third event, and got
to work quickly. Bathgate was altogether out of
condition, though in the first two rounds he got
on to Meadows when he liked. Then the oondltion
of the verdant one began to tell, and after some
pretty sparring and smart exchanges, he fairly
wore his man down, and beat him in tho final
round. The last blow was a knock down for
Meadows. This was the host set-to of the evening,
and the excitement during the progress of the
was as genuine as if bare knuckles dealt toe
blows, and blood and hair strewed the floor of the
arena. No one was hurt except a man at the back,
who toll off a chair in the second round. Selby

dltated result of a collision. They put their
heads together, and Fitzgerald retired with
a cut on his temple in which he ormld bury
his thumb. Mulholland and Miller, the Tasmanian,
next faced the music, and fought their four
rounds well out. A good give-and-take battle was
waged between the men, Mulholland having
slightly the best of it all through. A turn-up
between Foley and Turnbull wound up *he enter-
tainment. Weight-lifting by Turnbull and Cans
dell, and single-stick play between Cansdellanda

The hall was crowded, and the good order which
marks these entertainments was fully observed.
There is always a refining influence In
of a good man, whether pbj sically or morally good,
but ft is observable that muscle generally comes
ahead of morals in a gathering of men. The larri-
kin element Is not represented at the Gymnasium.
Foley superintends the entertainment, ana—wen,
you know, the aggressive spirits in the audience,
if any, have too much “respect for him to dis-
obey his mandate that good behaviour must be> ob-
served. Thus does the muscular man outweigh

The Sydney Driving Park Club held its
annual meeting on Saturday, 9th Instant, and in a
paragraph in our last issue wo briefly referred to
the day’s racing. A section of the dally Ire* B
having accused the committee of interfering un-
necessarily and endeavouring to thwart the secre-
tary in carrying out programme, we nave be n
requested to place the committee s version
the case before the public. Those ventjemei—!
Messrs. J. A. Roberts, J. T. MTnnes, J. M Laugh-
lm, and H. L. M Pike-assert that through the
neglect of the secretary they were compelled to
assume the entire management of the business or
the meeting. The printed programme and krect
card of the races specified the events and the
order in which they were to he run, and by this
the officers were guided. After th ® third event
—the ,3min. class—had been run, the secretary
descended from the stand and ordered out the pony
hurdle Jumpers. On these coming to the post Mr.
Roberts ordered them hack, pointing out that
they were about to usurp the place ot the
fourth event, the second division of the 3 mm.
trotters. There was, of course, much swearing ana
gnashing of teoth among Jockeys and owners, but
the committee were firm, and adhered stricly to
the programme. The secretary made his plaint to
the Press representatives present, and accused the
committee of thwarting his efforts to bring off a
good day’s sport. On being requested by one of
the committeemen, a man of business-standing in
the city, to give the statement in his previous issue
toe contradiction to which it was honestly entitled,
one at least of the reporters declined, and tne
other has not acknowledged the error. In the in-
terest of the sport, and for the sake of the gentle-
men who laboured to bring off a good day B racing,
we now affirm our belief that the charge brought
against the committee of unnecessarily interfer-
ing with the programme is entirely unfounded,
and that, were the circumstances fully stated, their
Justification and the secretary s humiliation would
be equally complete. #
A glance at the list of probables for the
fifth Austalian Eleven shows that it contains
a very modest Infusion of new blood after all.
At the most, there are not likely to be more than
four debutants. Six of the men mentioned went
home in 1884. while three others have made the trip
in previous years. However, there is one thing to
be said. The average age of our „ t ®? m J s
likely to exceed that of most of the English
elevens opposed to them. There.is always a strong
element of conservatism in the selection of All-
England Elevens.

Dirk Hatteraick has come to Flemington
from Adelaide once again, and looks handsomer
than ever. Perhaps the chestnut will contrive
to earn his keep this Journey, and prove himself
the racehorse ho has always looked. The public,
apparently, have wearied of Dirk since somebody
“ dreamt ’’ him for the Cup of 1883, and iur®d a lot
of small punters into having their little bit on the
gay deceiver. But. in spite of a long series of de-
feats, it only needs the “whisper’ to put em
again on the track of the moat taking looking
horse—bar none-at Flemington. Now the New-
market Handicap should be just about Dirk s
flutter. Time will show If there is anything in
the surmise. .

Those enlightened and progressive fathers
of the turf, the members of the A.J.C., held their
annual meeting in their rooms last Monday after-
noon. Quite a live time they had of it too-almost
as lively as a debate on a no-confidence motion
in Macquarie-street. Nearly £6OOO profit on the
year’s operations was shown by the balance-sheet,
at which the chairman (Hon. J. White, M.L.C.)
congratulated the members—and smiles circulated
generally around. Then the growling began by
Mr. L. F. Sachs demanding to know why a cer-
tain nomination for election to the committee was
Informal. The chairman replied that the required
21 days’ notice had not been given, on which Mr.
Sachs retorted that the necessity for this had been
improperly suppressed by the committee, lie
then went on to condemn the virtual appointment
of the committee of 1885 to serve for 1886, and also
what he styled the “ bunching of the same
body of men into office from year to year. But
he managed to considerably upset the equable
" no-one-is-perfect-but-us ” tempers of some of
the officials by a stinging reference to their de-
cision re that. Gannon-Long episode. This, or
course, must have sounded like flat heresy, but
worse was to come, for Mr. Sachs actually had
the audacity to declai e that “there were some mem-
bers of that body who, by their narrow-mindedness
and moral cowardice, imperilled the existence of
a club which ought to be in advance of every
Australasian Turf Club, hut which, as a matter of
fact, was very much in the rear-rank. Think of
that now after all the utterances of the daily Press
to show how far ahead Randwiok is of Fiemlng-
ton, in poor, unenlightened Victoria. Then no
less an ' “authority ’’ than the ,Non. T i„. c L*
Dangar arose in wrath and repudiation. He had
been 20 years on the committee, and to say they
were bunched was “almost an insolent imputa-
tion.” Just so, 20 years—no doubt on®° f the
men Mr. Sacha had just castigated. After a little
more expenditure of angry words over this
episode, the truly enlightened policy of charging
members two guineas admission to the offi-
cial stand in culdiCton to their yearly subscrip-
tion of live guineas was challenged. Two legal
gentlemen present expressed an opinion that the

N.S.w. turf, when will you be governed by a body
of men capable of managing your affairs on busi-
ness principles ? One thing Las been made clear
by this meeting, and It is that, if racing in this
colony is to hold its own, new blood must be in-
fused Into the ranks of those controlling it. Fos-
sils who have droned on the committee since the
bad old times of years ago must be cleared out to
make room for younger and more spirited men.

The following telegram was received on
Monday last by Folev’s representative:— Newton
proposes box Foley £lOO a-side. Any interference
whatever, each party to take down stake and
divide gate. Fight to a finish. Winner to take
two-thirds. Match to take place at F oley 8 Hall.
Get immediate answer Foley. To this the ioF
lowing reply was sent on luesday afternoon.
“ Foley accepts your terms, as stated in telegram,
and requests deposit be forwarded at once to Bul-
lstin Office or proprietor of one of thelSydney
journals. Foley will cover deposit on receipt.
Match nine weeks from signing articles. H oley
guarantees no interference, and if such should be
caused by any of his friends, will
stake.” This should surely satisfy the Melbourne
party, and the match may, we hope, be looked
upon as arranged. The terms of Foley s reply to
Newton also apply to the Farnan-Foley match.

Visitors to Ashfleld Recreation Ground on
Saturday were delighted to see the scale on which
preparations have been made for future athletic
gatherings. Over £9OOO has been spent on the
ground and buildings, and the result has been the
creation of a formidable rival to the Association
Ground. Bicycling, cricket, bowls, skittles, and
billiards, each have their peculiar space. gas is
laid on, and the appointments generally testify to
the generosity of the directors, and intelligent
energy of the hon. secretary. Mr. R. C- Webster.
The popularity of the ground in such hands is
assured.

After much wordy warfare, Farnan and
Foley are at length to meet in the ring. 1 oley
allows Farnan £35 for expenses to come to Sydney
and box to a finish, in eight weeks from signing
articles, for £lOO a-side.
Amongst other attractions for athletes at
the Gymnasium, George-street, Foley has recently
provided a couple of enormous brown bears.
These animals are highly trained, and go through
various military evolutions with a grace which
would make a Soudan soldier turn green with
envy. They are also skilled wrestlers, and open
at any time to try a fail with a visitor. Their
style is mixed, but Larry says they know all the
“ stops and holts.” They are harmless and good
tempered, and generally wears muzzles to keep
people from fooling with their behind teeth.
Foley has a “turn-up” with them every day for
practice; more tun lighting them than a circular
saw, he says. The animals are on view all day and
in the evening.

Malone and O’Brien are matched to run
for £lOO a-side on the 14th February. The distances
will be three—imlle, 1000 yards, and 9|mlle. The
imile event will be decided first, after which the
contestants will toss for choice of the other.
Malone is giving away a great deal in meeting
O’Brien at his own distances, for though a fast
sprinter Malone is only a sprinter, and if he is
beaten at these long range races he must not be
surprised. The Association Ground or the Agri-
cultural Society’s Grounds will probably be
selected for the match.
* * •
At the Gymnasium, George-street, on
Monday evening, Mr. Norman Turnbull was pre-
sented, by Mr. Foley, with a silver cup, as a tribute
to his prowess as an all-round athlete. The cup,
which was designed and made by Mr. Evan Jones,
is of silver, chased, engraved, and inscribed, and
valued at £3O.
The enormous increase in the sales is a
proof of the growing popularity of Wolfe’S
Schnapps.


If you are ordered Schnapps your medical
attondent naturally supposes you get Wolfe’s

Political
Points
The Armidale Chronicle thinks that the
late N.S.W. Premier should not be called Dlbbs.
It would like to see the initial altered to F.
Dan O’Connor promises the N.S.W. post-
men that their next Christmas holidays shall be
more plentiful than their last. Daniel promises
too fast. He himself will likely have political
holidays next Christmas.
Says a Hobart telegram:—“lt is expected
that nearly the whole of the Australian squadron
will be in the river during the sitting of the
Federal Council ” We should have thought the
local police capable of controlling the discussion,
England can teach Australia nothing in
politioal manners. Ou election day, at Oxford
university, the statue of Lord Beaoonsfield was
first defaced, and then, by way of retaliation, some
too ardent 'lories completely decapitated Mr.
Gladstone.
Lord Cranbourne, eldest son of the Mar-
Suls of Salisbury, only won a seat In the English
ommons for North-East Lancashire by five votes.
The Liberals say they can prove at least a dozen
cases of personation and are certain of being able
to unseat him.
Writes “ Oagonet”: “Such tactics as the
English Church party resorted to during the late
British elections would disgrace a pagan. The
cause must indeed be desperate when it has to be
supported by tactics which Judas Iscariot and
Ananias would have blushed to resort to.”
“We believe the verdict of the colony
would be that the second House is neither use nor
ornament. It is simply a refuge for the worn-out
and discarded members of the Lower House,
where they can air their spite and show their
venom.”—Yobke’s Peninsula Advertiser.
The banquet “ tendered to Dan. O’Connor,
the N.S.W. Postmaster-General, by his friends and
admirers, in recognition of his elevation to the
Ministry,” is fixed for the 33rd inst. This is hurry-
Ing things up, but Parliament meets on the 37th,
and after that it 1s not a banquet but a political
“ wake ” that the Jaynill one will be afther
wantin’.
The Campbelltown Post says Tom Garrett
did not join Sir John Robertson’s Ministry because
by so doing “ he would have been acting in direct
opposition to his old and trusted medical adviser.”
If all that the wily Thomas does is under the
direction of his old and trusted medical adviser,
we are inclined to think that the latter has some
original ideas concerning the science of health.
At a London girls’ school (“Collegiate
Establishment for Young Ladies ” is what they
call it in the Home papers), it Is alleged that the
pupils were made to learn some of Chamberlain’s
speeches by heart. In Sydney a schoolmistress
threatened to put away the cane and make the
girls learn so many lines of Dan. O’Connor’s speech
Instead, as a punishment. The behaviour at that
School has been most exemplary ever since.
Mr. Reuben Quarrill, of the Geelong Ad-
VERXISBR, is one of the candidates for the repre-
sentation of that gruesome town at the next
general election. If bis name is any Index to his
nature he will be welcomed with open arms by
Messrs. Bent and Gaunson, and will be received
by Colonel Smith even as a dear and long-lost
brother—that Is, if these gentlemen got in again.
But there is no such luok for the colony as their
not getting in, we fear.
Thus the Sydney D. T.“ Dr. Moorhouse
is a fully-developed Liberal in English politics.”
Yes, his Lordship certainly Is a fully-developed
Liberal If the polities of the D. T. are Liberal. But
Victorians have never yet seen any of Bishop
Moorhouse’s fully-developed Liberalism in that
colony; they know him in politics only as a
thoroughpaced Tory and staunch Imperialist, and
his energetic advocacy of Toryism and Imperial-
ism teems to have secured promotion for him with
£4300 a year.
The list of probable candidates for Parlia-
mentary honours in Victoria includes the name of
Mr. George Rignold, the actor. The name of his
partner does not appear. Perhaps they think that
it would be altogether too much of a good thing
for the two to join in the “ show ” at the top of
Bourke-street. Is Allison reserving himsalf for
theN.B.W. Assembly as a rival to Dan. O’Connor
or Quong Tart ? We heard Jim orate once, and if
he were to get a seat on ithe *’ flure ” of the ’Ouse
we should not (D V.) miss the opportunity to hear
his maiden speech there.
We understand that at the instance and
with the aid of several justly-discontented sub-
scribers, the representatives of a member of the
N.S.W. Contingent who lost his life in connection
with the Soudan expedition, intend to sue the
trustees nf the so-ealled Patriotic Fund for the
money now in their hands, and that an enter-
prising firm of solicitors have consented to take
the matter up. We cordially wish the lawyers
every success ; we consider ft a shame that the
money should be lying idle and benefiting no de-
serving person—but simply increasing the city
Influence of a set of purse-proud Fodsnaps.
According to Lady Randolph Churchill, a
branch of the Primrose League has been estab-
lished in Sydney. Reynolds writes:—“ The Tories
In the present campaign receive the greatest assis-
tance from their female relatives. While the work-
ing man’s wife is at her tub, the Tory’s wife is
going about canvassing for her husband, and
threatening poor, timid shopkeepers with the
withdrawal of custom if the Liberal be returned.
These are the Dames of the Primrose League, who
are not ashamed to show their borrowed plumes
in the houses of the men by whose labour they
are enabled to live Idle and luxurious lives.”
The British Government had to pay a
pretty penny for the hiring of the American
liners, which, like those of the Orient and other
Anglo-Australian mall steamers chartered by
them, they fitted out as “armed cruisers” in
anticipation of a war with Russia. The freight
ranged from 17s. 6d to £llos. per ton per mouth
with the crew, and from 13s. 6d. to £1 per ton per
month, the Government paying the crew. A fair
Idea of what the six months’ rent came to may be
Sot when it is known that the tonnage of the
regon is 7375, the Umbria 7718, the Alaska 6933,
and the Arizona 5148. And what has been gained
by the expenditure ?
Mr. J. D. Ypung, M.L.A. for West Sydney,
at a recent back-scratching feed, is reported to
have said that “ after the eloquent speeches they
had listened to he wss at a loss what to say.” This
is beautiful. J. D. Young always is at a loss what
to say. As a politioal orator he is a conspicuous
failure, and his return to Parliament is the most
notable evidence of the lamentable gullibility and
want of discrimination of the electors of his con-
stituency. We can hardly acknowledge J. D,
Younger Dan. O’Connor, who comes irOm the
game electorate, to be capable representatives of
West Sydney, but consider them equally fit to re-
? resent the men who were idiotic enough to vote
or them.
w Mr. G. B. Simpson, the N.S.W. Attorney-
General, has gone to Melbourne on a fortnight’s
holiday.” You may not see anything uncommon
In this Item, culled from the “ Brevities ” column
of a country contemporary. Well, there is more
fun in this than in an average funeral. If Mr.
G. B. Simpson had travelled on a train, a steam-
boat, or even, following in the wheel track of the
Illustrious Justice Williams, of Victoria, sped
overland on a patent safety bicycle, there would
have been no fun in the festive par. But—and
mark—the hon. gentleman has gone to Melbourne
on a fortnight’s holiday. Surely a cheap way of
travelling. When he returns, probably he will
commence work.
Ye gods! Listen. From a Sydney Daily
Telegraph leader:—** We fully recognise that we
owe him (Henniker Heaton) to the Empire, and
resign him to Canterbury without a pang. It is
better so. The Conservative party sadly needs a
Man: Australia presents it with Heaton and his
autobiography. And thus does N.S W. twice in a
year cover itself with glory by coming to the
relief of the Empire in the moment of its ex-
tremity.” The D.T , groning round for popularity
as usual, has, we are glad to see, come rather
tardily to comprehend that the people of N.S.W.
look with the profoundest contempt on the whole
Soudan expedition business, and the Telegraph
gibes at it accordingly. We are sorry, however,
that the D.T. should appear to couple even the
Soudan donkey with the member for Canterbury,
England. The degradation is really too bitter—for
the donkey.
A correspondent having called Mr. Cham-
berlain’s attention to the fact that the reverses
of the Liberals had been attributed to a reaction
asrainst Radicalism, Mr. Chamberlain has replied
(December 1) that “he does not attach any import-
ance to the so-called anti-Radioal reaction, and
believes that the failure of the Liberal Party in
many constituencies is due entirely to other
causes, and chiefly to the opposition of the Irish
and the Church Party. Besides this, the de-
pression in trade has made many ignorant voters
anxious for change. Mr. Chamberlain will not
allow anything to turn him aside from the policy
to which he has committed himself.” Mr. Cham-
berlain added that there was against the Radicals
a most unusual combination—the five P's—the
Priests, Publicans, Parsons, Parnellites, and Pro-
tectionists—a combination which had never op-
posed them before, and probably never would
again.
The N.S.W. Postmaster-General has taken
the public into his confidence, and great will be
tneir benefit in consequence. He says that he was
always under the impression that the office of
P.M.G. was the least Important In the Government
(how does this read in conjunction with his pre-
vious declaration that he was the first member
whom Sir John asked to take office ?), but his
experience of a fortnight showed him that it
required a man of great ability to administer the
Department. Like Dan O’Connor, for example;
IN THE HARDENS.

or Jannery John Davies, C.M.G,, who onoe held
the office I He added that future Cabinet-makers
would have to make a note of his statement; in
other words: “If they do not raise me to the pla-
ns cle of the ambition of exalted manhood by
making me Postmaster-Jineral, they will have to
appoint someone possessed of the same magnificent
character—the same luminosity of Intellect—the
same omniperoiplenoe and the same dauntless
courage as I possess.” Hurroo 1
Thanks to the good Bishop of Ballarat, we
may expect a purification of the Victorian Parlia-
ment after the approaching elections. He has
desired the parsons of his diocese to pray the right
people into the next House, it is doubtful, how-
ever, if even the Bishop will be able to prevent
one or two black sheep slipping into the Parlia-
mentary fold. We fear that the list of “ proper
persons ” will be exhausted before all the M.’sL.A.
are elected. Presuming, for instance, that there
are 100 seats vacant, and only something like 90
“ proper persons ” to fill ’em, no amount of prayer
can prevent a few wrong 'uns stepping in and
drawing their £3OO a year. Providence will do its
best, no doubt, but we dare not hope that jobbery
will be abollsned right away. By the way, it is
significant that neither Graham Berry, Service,
nor Kerferd is seeking re-eleetlon. They got wind
of the Bishop’s scheme of prayer and guessed that
their Parliamentary knell was sounded.
The new Queensland Licensing Act came
into force on the Ist Inst., and is a more
enlightened measure than the N.S.W. law. One
very good provision is that every publican must
affix his name and address on every bottle of beer
or spirits be sells. This provision may often lead
to the identification of unknown drunks In case of
accident. It will be rather difficult to carry out
the prohibitory clause forbidding sale of liquor
to young gentlemen and young ladies under 18
years of age, unless they carry about them birth-
certificates. In N.S.W. we should have to fix the
limit somewhere about 15, for we know of num-
bers of accomplished, steady boosors not yet in
their 17th year. We noticed a boy the other day,
who couldn't have been more than seven, lighting
his eigar-stump from the pipe of an old man of at
least 70; and not very long since we watched a
youth of but 16 take five pints of “ colonial beer ”
before breakfast. True. Sir Henry, we haven’t
got much to learn from the old country—in some
things.
The Western Advocate eulogises the
new N.S.W. Ministry. After a preamble de-
voted to Sir John Robertson, whom it considers
the patriot on account of his having “found
homes for the people,” it thus proceeds—” Mr.
Spring will not make any mistake if he fulfils the
Instructions of the Premier; Mr. Garrard will not
go far wrong if he obeys Mr. Goodchap and Mr.
Whltton ; Mr. Burns can depend upon the
accuracy of Mr. Geoffrey Eager; Mr. Vaughn will
not go astray if he lets Mr. Barrie Wood control
the Mines without let or hindrance; Mr. O’Connor
is good enough for Postmaster-General, for all he
will have to do is to smile, make things pleasant,
attend picnics and banquets, and deliver post-
prandial orations; Mr. Lambton will do actual
work; and Mr. Young will do very well if he is
clever enough to allow matters to remain as they
are.” “It is plain from all this,” remarks the
Armidale Chronicle, “ that there is no need of
any Minister save Sir John Robertson.” And as
Sir John is only partially alive just now, we aren’t
quite sure whether there’s any need for even him.
Mr. Gerald Spring, the new N.S.W. Mini-
ster for Lands, has altered the text of clause 33 of
the Parnell Land Act to read after the word “ un-
measured ” j “ And does not join a measured por-
tion.” This is a return to the practise of all
former administrations by which a man could
proceed to take un an additional conditional pur-
chase without defacing previous surveys. But
pass the cornopean :
Gerald Spring, in Summer weather, with your col-
leagues pull together;
And in Autumn be you always at your leader’s
beck and call;
In the Winter differ never, lest the " gilded ” cord
you sever—
For remember, Gerald, always that the Spring
precedes the fall.
And, Sir John, we’d whisper gently, watch your
new colleagues intently;
Their acts and deeds will bind you—you’ve no
faithful men at back;
You must watch their young law-making, or your
leave you’ll soon be taking.
And with Spring, ere Summer perish, you will
get, like Dlbbs, the sack.
Thus the Argus correspondent:—“Hen-
nlker Heaton’s triumph at Canterbury is the re-
sult of many months’ arduous wooing of the elec-
tors of Canterbury. The military element dis-
tinctly sympathised with his candidature, for he
posed as the son of an officer of high rank and
ancient and illustrious descent. Mr. Heaton was
fortunate in successfully combating the objections
raised by the Radicals to the soldiery exercising
their votes, and was rewarded by obtaining the
suffrages of most of the men In the Canterbury
cantonments. . . . Mr. Heaton evidently in-
tends to be an active member. He has already
assured the electors that he has a scheme for the
solution of the problem known as the bitter cry of
outcast London. He and other practical philan-
thropists and capitalists are trying to secure 1500
acres in the suburbs of London, on which they
will erect four-roomed cottages, with fire-places,
grates, and everything perfect, a back garden and
a front flower-garden, and let them to the work-
ingmen at 4s, per week. He believes the State
would lend the money at 3 per cent.” Henniker,
we are ready to bet, will yet be a peer. He ob-
viously possesses all the necessary qualities.
A prominent supporter of the N.S.W. Go-
vernment has been industriously circulating a
statement to the effect that Sir John Robertson
absolutely declined to undertake to form a
Ministry unless Lord Caring ton pledged himself
to grant a dissolution in the event of the new Go-
vernment meeting with an adverse vote in the
House. This Is a most ungenerous fabrication. It
is quite a common political trick to talk of a disso-
lution so as to frighten members who have not too
secure a hold on their seats, but we have never
before heard of the dodgery being carried to such
an extreme as is indicated above. How does Lord
Carington appreciate the statement ? He is repre-
sented as being pledged to not only a most ridi-
culous but also a grossly unconstitutional course
of procedure; and. further, his “faithful” ad-
visers would place him in the position of a violent
E artisan. As far as we are aware, Lord Carington
as never displayed any of the qualifications of a
statesman, but we must credit him with having
sufficient commonsense to prevent his being
trapped into such a false position by the members
of a Government the existence of which has not,
practically, been recognised by Parliament, and
which, as any untutored myall could see, does
not represent the intelligence of the Assembly,
Life in Fiji does not seem to be altogether
enjoyable, if we may credit the accounts of ad-
ministrative vagaries as communicated by several
correspondents in that colony. They allege that
whenever the deputies of Downing-street find that
cash is wanted for the public creditors (which is
constantly the case), the accounts for years back
are resurrected, and a second liquidation sued for.
If the persons Indebted can show receipts, they
are of course clear, but if they have lost these,
they must pay again unto the uttermost farthing.
As to the way in which immigration matters are
managed (we quote a correspondent): “Mr. Palr-
frieve, the late manager of the Colonial
ugar Refining Company, stated in the Supreme
Court that he had never received a correct
account from the Immigration
and he was quite sure no accounts, if they could
be called * accounts,’ could be in a more disgrace-
ful state.” This is only the natural result of the
practical Irresponsibility of the officials of Fiji.
There is no worse despotism than that of one of
England’s Crown colonies. The administrators are
judge and jury in their own case, and can flout
any who dare to complain with that insolence
which is born of impunity, and it is a poor officer
who cannot satisfy Downing-street as to the
necessity of his most arbitrary and tyrannical
actions. Fiji now seems to be writhing in that
stage of official t hraldom, which, onoe the curse of
New South Wales, has left the soar of the lash and
leg-irons imprinted on the limbs of the colony
to-day.
Biihop Thornton (Anglican), of Ballarat,
known to fame as “ Soapy Sam,” has prepared a
special prayer for the coming Victorian general
election, and has issued same to his flock:— 1 “ O,
Almighty Lord and Heavenly Father, wo beseech
thee to guide and govern the minds of Thy people
In sincerity and judgment, that being called to
elect just legislators and faithful counsellors to
the head of the State to serve in the Parliament
of this colony, we may, each of us, perceive botn
the sacredness of this trust which Thy Providence
commits to us, and also the greatness of the inter-
ests which depends upon its exercise, and may
oonsoientously and wisely make choice of fit per-
sons for this service that religion and virtue,
peace and happiness, truth and justice may
he established for future generations, through
Jesus Christ Our Lord. Amen.” The Archbishop
of Canterbury, it will be remembered, also issued
a special prayer on the eve of the last British
general election. He professed to remain politi-
cally neutral. Yet the whole influence of his
Church was strenuously exerted in aid of the
Conservatives to whom Divine Providence saw
fit not to give a majority. So much for political
prayers. Soapy Samuel’s little orison reminds us
of a story we once read about a German minister
who was walking in a procession at the head of
his parishioners over cultivated fields, in order to
procure a blessing upon the crops. When he
came to one of unpromising appearance he would
pass on, saying, “ Here prayers and singing will
avail nothing; this must have manure.” The
political soil, Samuel, was never yet in the world’s
history made to bring forth good fruit by any
bishop or any priest.
Mr. R. B. Smith’s party among the free
and independent of Mackay electorate have been
considering the action of Mr. Danger in challenging
the election of Mr. R. B. Smith. A motion was
unanimously carried, condemning Mr. Danger’s
action as frivolous and insulting to the electors of
the Macleay. This reminds us of an old election
in 1869, when Mr. R. B. Smith contested the
Hastings aaralnst Dr. Horace Dean, and was de-
feated by 115 votes. R. B. challenged the election,
on the grounds that Dean held an office of profit
under the Crown. True enough. Horace was
postmaster at the one-horse village of Tlnonee,
drawing the magnificent salary of £lO per year.
The Committee of Elections declared the election
void, and again Horace and Robert Burdett
appealed to the constituency. This time the
doctor defeated the fascinating lawyer by a
majority of something like 900 votes. But
the gallant Bob, though ignominiously routed
all along the line, was not dismayed. He had a
scheme of operations in his eye. Again he chal-
lenged the seat on the ground that the sitting
member was not a naturalised subject of Her
Majesty. The committee investigated the case.
Discovered that the Doctor, though he had been
fifteen years in the colony, and had married and
brought up a family of seven children in N.8.W.,
was still an alien, having had the misfortune to be
born in America. The Doctor was accordingly
ousted, and the seat given to the smart Bob, who
represented a large minority of the Hastings elec-
tors until the next general election. And now
some objectionable and pestilential fellow has
dared to challenge the idol of the Macleay on
frivolous grounds, and the indignant electors are
outrageously scandalised at the insult thus directed
against them.
We have always credited the Hon. Gra-
ham Berry with the possession of that desirable
commodity called “ cheek,” and it has not sur-
prised us to notice one or two of his recent
vagaries. The other day, when addressing his
constituents at Geelong, he told them that a new
coalition, which would contain Solicitor-General
Deakin as leader of the Liberal section of the
Cabinet, would be very desirable, and Mr. Deakin
would take care that the Protective policy of
Victoria would not be endangered by any Conser-
vative devices. It is only a little while back since
Chief Secretary Berry launched the Tasmanian
Treaty, which was a direct blow at the
Protective policy of the Southern colony.
The other day, at the Liberal caucus, the ver-
satile and wily Graham advised his followers to
continue the coalition, because there was a fear
that a return to party Government might place
the balance of power In the hands of the Roman
Catholics who were working to undermine the
Education Act. Now, we remember when Gra-
ham Berry was allied with the iDuffy party in
1873, he was one of the most strenuous opponents
of the Education Act that Messrs. Francis and
Stephen brought in and passed into law. Those
strange freaks on the part of Mr. Berry do not,
however, surprise us much. For many years he
has passed as a staunch Liberal, and it is not long
since he told the electors that “he was always a
good Conservative; in fact, he had never been
within a thousand miles of being a Radical.” The
hon. gentleman says he intends to return to Vic-
toria and re-enter public life, after he has drawn
£BOOO per annum for three years in England as
Agent-General, but we Imagine that the Radicals
of Victoria, after his desertion of them, are not
likely to again receive him with open arms.
One of the worst features of Victorian
Liberalism is that it is espoused by religious bigots
and hypocrites, psalm-singers, “ ranters,” lip-
loyalists, and Orangemen, who get into political
prominence by pandering to the worst passions,
and feeding the worst prejudices of the com-
munity. The other day Mr. Berry’s Parliamentary
followers met at his office in Melbourne to consider
whether or not the Coalition Ministry should be
continued. Professor Pearson, of the Age, who is
reported to be a good judge of bell-wethert, was
there ; so also were ex-Hon. Richard Richardson
(the Grand Master of the Orangemen), who some
few months ago was compelled to resign his posi-
tion as an Executive Councillor; the pious George
Washington Hall; those shining lights of the
Orange order—John James, Mr. Wren, Mr. Russell,
and Jack Gardiner: and those other sanctimonious
senators—Messrs. Bell, Baker, Graham, Nimmo,
D. M. Davies, A. Young, “Bob” Reid, and Dr.
Rose. Professor Pearson (acting, we suppose,
under instructions from David Syme, of the AGE,
whose mission seems to be to keep the No-Popery
cry to the front at all times) declared his aversion
to a further continuance of the Coalition, but ex-
pressed his fear of a combination between: Conser-
vatives and Catholics; and the goody-goody
Richardson was afraid that if the Liberals did not
come back strong enough trouble would arise
from the Papists, who would dictate their own
terms. The saintly G. W. Hall warned the meet-
ing that “in his electorate—the Moira—the Catho-
lics were placing every available man on the
rolls, and were shaping for a strong fight whilst
other pious M.’sLA. followed on the same track.
Victorian Liberalism must indeed be in a very
sorry plight if it requires such stuff as this to lead
it again to victory. As a matter of fact, the men
who pursue these disreputable tactics are men of
the Lloyd, Abigail, and Parkes stamp—men desti-
tute of politioal principles, who are only too glad

(HT HERE are many men in this colony who are,
P day by day, melancholy, miserable, and o
burden to themselves, through early indiscretion
or over-indulgence. It is to those that this adver
tisement is addressed. Impotence drags its victim
in its unhappy train through years of suffering,
rendering his existence a misery. He sees his
fellow beings ham, hearty, and vigorous—in the
full enjoyment of manhood’s greatest privilege
and naturally becomes despondent, seeking soli-
tariness, and shunning society generally.

such be your calamity, know that your case can

AYER’S
Cherry Pectoral.
No other complaints are so insidious in their
attack as those affecting the throat and lungs:
none so trifled with by the majority of suffer-
ers. The ordinary cough or cold, resulting
perhaps from a trifling or unconscious ex-
posure, is often hut the beginning of a fatal
sickness. Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral has
well proven its efficacy in a forty years’ fight
with throat and lung diseases, and should be
taken in all cases without delay.
A Terrible Cough Cured,
“In 18571 took a severe cold, which affected
my lungs. I had a terrible cough, and passed
night after night without sleep. The doctors
gave me up. 1 tried Ayer’s Cherry Pec-
toral, which relieved my lungs, induced
sleep, and afforded mo the rest necessary
for the recovery of my strength. By the
continued use of the Pectoral a perma-
nent cure was effected. I am now 62 years
old, hale and hearty, and am satisfied your
Cherry Pectoral saved me.
Horace Fairbrothee.”
Rockingham, Yt,, July 15, 1882.
Croup. A Mother’s Tribute.
“"While in the country last winter my little
boy, three years old, was taken ill with croup;
it seemed as if he would die from strangu-
lation. One of the family suggested the use
of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, a bottle of
which was always kept in the house. This
was tried in small and frequent doses, and
to our delight in less than half an hour the
little patient was breathing easily. The doc-
tor said that the Cherry Pectoral had
saved my darling’s life. Can you wonder at
our gratitude ? Sincerely yours,
Mrs. Emma Gedney.”
159 West 128th St., New York, May 16, 1882.
“ I have used Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral

GREAT
ANNOYANCE
has been caused
to all people using
tooth brushes by the
bristles coming out in
the mouth. The Pall
Mall Electric Associ-
ation now take pleasure
in introducing to the Aus-
tralian public a Tooth Brush, which they
guarantee free from this troublesome defect.
The bristles are inserted in the handle by a
patent process, which renders it simply
impossible to come out in use. In ad'
dltlon to this, the handle of the Brush is
made of a newly invented material perma-
nently charged with an electro-magnetic
current, which acts without' any shock
immediately upon the nerves and tissues
of the teeth and gums. The act of
brushing causes tms current to flow
into the nerve cells and roots of
the teeth, and, like water poured
upon a plant, it invigorates and
vitalizes every mrt, arresting
decay, building "lip and re-
storing the natural white-
ness of tho enamel and
quickly producing
healthful, rosy-
coloured gums.
The handle is strong,
beautifully polished,
not affected by acids,
Impervious to
moisture, and free
from that un-
pleasant musty
odour exu-
ding from
wet bons
handles.

ASSOCIATION
Now offer to the Aus-
tralian public their new
Electric Hair, Beard St
Moustache Curler, it
is a handsome article, nickel-
plated, with an ebonized handle, and it
/ should occupy a place in the toilet of
every lady and gentleman in Australia.
By its aid, the hair, beard, or moustache
can lie curled in any desired'style in from
one to two minutes. For ladies, it produces
the.“ Langtry Style,” the “ Patti Bang,” the
“Montague Curl,” and any other styles
desired by ladies wearing their hair in the
fashionable “lapse and fluffy” mode.
Those who wear waves er other forms
ofartifleial hair will find this Electric
Curler a very useful article. It does
not break off and ruin the hair,
like the ordinary'ciimping pro-
cess, and in wet or hot weather
it works as quickly as in cold.
For curling the Moustache
or Beard in a moment, it
has no equal, while it is
so simple in its opera-
tion that any one of
either sex cam use it
successfully the first
time. ■

HEATONIANA.
following is the circular to the elec-
tors of Canterbury, elsewhere referred to in this
Issue;—** To the E'ectors of Canterbury. Gentle-
men,—Like many other Australians, I have been
much surprised at Mr. J Henniker Heaton's
audacity In standing as the Conservative candidate
for Canterbury. 1 know it is difficult to suppress
sueh a pushing obtrutlve person, but I am sure If
the electors of your city knew him as well as he is
known In Sydney, they would deal with him as ild
the people of N.S.W. when he once veßtured to
claim their suffrages. Now, what is Mr. Henniker
Heaton, and on what grounds can ho ask you to
elect Htm to Parliament ? Mr. Heaton claims to
have been born in Canterbury, but nobody has
seen the certificate, and to all intents and pur-
poses he Is a stranger to the city. He has had no
experience of English politics, and his Conserva-
tive qualities musr. be very new born, for the
Sydney Evening News, of which he claims to be
part-owner, is a Radical organ—the most advanced
in all the Australian colonies. Having such an
association, how came Mr. Heaton to be taken up
by the Conservative party ? You, gentlemen of
Canterbury, may know sufficient of your local
Wire-pullers, but you do not know how, in this
instance, they have been led to accept a nominee
of the Carlton and St. Stephen’s Clubs, in prefer-
ence to giving honour to some good local man,
known to all men. It was through the Tory chiefs
in London that Mr. Heaton has been foisted upon
your constituency, and Mr. Heaton gulled these
chiefs to believe that he was a great man in Sydney,
and a rich man. willing to spend his money in the
Conservative cause. By joining a Conservative
club be came to know a few leading public men.
Then followed the usual dinner*, luncheons, and
receptions which form so prominent a part among
the duties of modern Veneerings, and those who
wish to push themselves into society. Papers iise
the Court Journal and Morning Post publish
these private entertainments, and give lisisof all
the guests-on being heavily paid for It.
This sort of machinery has been well work el
by Mr. Heaton. Many who know the colonial
Status of the man have been annoyed to receive
his invitations, and disgusted to find that even
when they declined his hospitality he advertised
their names, as being present, in the newspapers
above referred to. When the country was ringing
with enthusiasm over the conduct of our N.a.W.
J. HENNIKER HEATON.
Government in sending a contingent of troops to
Suakim, Mr. Heaton caused it to be announced in
the London Press that he intended to give £lOOO
towards the cost of that contingent, ask him if
he has carried out that promise. You will find
that he shields his purse behind the donation of
£lOOO given by the proprietors of the Evening
News. In other ways Mr. Heaton has lest no op-
portunity to keep himself before the British pub-
lic. He has claimed to be in this country the
unanimously-elected delegate of people of
Mauritius, and to have secured for them, by bis
influence with Lord Derby, the boon of self-
government. The Mauritius Sentinel (see Can-
terbury Press of August 1) has sharply attacked
Hr. Heaton for this unwarrantable assumption.
The method in which Mr. Heaton uses his oppor-
tunities is well illustrated in these Mauritius inci-
dents. He happened to be on the same ship as Sir
J. P. Hennessy, the Governor, to whom he made
himself agreeable. They became friends. The
Governor espoused the cause of reform, and a
small committee, acting for the native party in the
island, accepted Mr. Heaton’s volunteered services
to attend to their interests in London. Mr. T.
Dickson, a well-known gentleman in the island
writes:—‘l am not In a position to say how many
visits Mr. Heaton has paid Mauritius. He may have
been here frequently and we may quite as often
have entertained an angel unawares. This should
ho a reproach to us, for the only notice that was
taken of Mr. Heaton was the infection of his
name in the passenger lists of the steamers,’ and
he adds: ‘Nine-tenths of the reform committee
knew nothing of Mr. Heaton's famous appoint-
ment.’ But the supremo joke of Mr. Heaton’s
connection with Mauritius is found in his dealings
with Mr. Harold White’s bag of despatches. ‘At
considerable risk’ he carried these dispatches in
his portmanteau from Heunlon to the British
agent at Aden. The Times (dulv instructed by
Mr.Heaton) announced tnis great achievement;
Mr. Heaton himself published all the details of
his daring enterpiise, and at length tho public
really began to believe that this great representa-
tive Australian had narrowly escaped a French
yard-arm. Captain Boyle, however, pricked the
bubble reputation which Mr. Heaton had en-
deavoured to make, by the simple piucessof show-
ing that the service rendered by Mr. Heaton was
or the most commop-place kind. Alas for this
revelation! It crushed all the efforts that were
being made to obtain a 0.M.G,, as a reward for
Mr. Heaton’s services. In other wa*ys this gentle-
man has endeavoured: to obtain notoriety. The
effusive fashion In which he forced his attentions
on the Queen of the Netherlands, at the Amster-
dam Exhibition, was a slight to the representa-
tives of his colony, and a reproach to all well-bred
Australians. Not many months ago be volun-
teered to the Tasmanian Government to act, at
his own cost, as their delegate at the Berlin Tele-
graph Conference. Though the other Australian
representatives gave him the cold shoulder, he so
worked the Times correspondent In Berlin that
the leading English newspaper gave Mr. Heaton
more prominence than any other representative.
[Mr. Cracknell, the Superintendent of N.S.W.
Telegraphs, writes to the Sydney papers express-
ing his surprise that Henniker "Should have had
the audacity to say that he succeeded at Berlin in
getting a reduction from 6s sd. to 3s. Bd. per word
for the Press.” .... Mr. Cracknell adds : -
“ Mr. Heaton was not even Invited to attend the
meetings, when thlsmatter was arranged.”—Ed.B ]
Whenever any Australian question is on foot in
England you will be sure to see Mr. Heaton airing
his opinions in the London newspapers, and just
as surely the Australian Press will be down upon
Mr. Heaton, and hold him up to ridicule. They
describe his Press career as a ‘ridiculous fizzle; ’
they remind him of the late Walter Cooper’s
horsewhip; of the excursion to Jervis Bay, when
‘ he got himself somehow Invited, to the amaze-
ment and distress of every guest in the company.’
They are even still more cruel, for they revive
the recollection of a certain dinner to General
when all the Agents-General but one
were invited, and not one attended. General
Scratchley’s annoyance at being deluded to act as
the figure-head of Mr, Heaton’s entertainment is
a matter of common notoriety in Sydney.
The publication of this little gathering in
a London fashionable paper
to let the groundlings know what high company
any he kept, was felt by some besides General
Scratchley to be an Insult to his guests. Others
have, happily, profited by General Scratchley’a
experience Lord Rosebery has .... Lord
Carlngton has declined .... —even to‘come
and see my library.’ Mr. Heaton’s claims to be a
representative Australian are just as much a sham
as his pretensions to move in those high social
circles to which vulgar parvenus always aspire.
Against his financial honesty, or his moral char-
acter, I say nothing, but if any of his supporters
believe Mr, Heaton to have claims upon them
because of his cheque book—lf they think him to
be a rich man—let them judge him by his own
words as expressed by his own lawyers. The
Sydney Morning Herald of March 1,1881, con-
tains a very long report of the libel action of
Robertson v. Archibald, Heaton, and others,
which resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff, £lOOO
damages. In that trial, Mr. Pilcher, the defendants’
counsel, declared that Heaton had rot a shilling
In the world, and that his Income was entirely de-
rived from his wife’s Interest In her father’s estate I
One more newspaper quotation. The Sydney
Bulletin of April 35 last publishes the following
paragraph ‘ Mr. Henntker Heaton, who still
hankers after a Conservative seat, has Inflicted on
the readers of the London Times a long and
dreary letter In commendation of the military
spirit displayed by this colony. That reminds us
that the only opportunity Mr. Heaton ever had of
displaying a military spirit was when he made a
well-executed flank movement behind a barmaid’s
skirts, to evade the encroachments of Walter
Cooper’s whip I ’ This is the sort of person whom
you are asked to elect for Canterbury.—J L.
Brampton, a New South Welshman.” We need
only make one remark with respect to this circu-
lar. The Sydney Evening News is not entitled
to the honour of being termed a Radical paper.
Like Henniker Heaton, it has no political prin-
ciples, and trims its sails on the catchpenny prin-
ciple to the breeze of ihe hour.
