ISINGTON MILL, HAMOSHIRE, TYPIFIES ENGLAND'S RURAL CHARM
TSINGTON MILL, on the River Wey, is situated in the Parish of
Bentley, a hamlet which, in the 18th century, was described as “a
delightful, pleasant and neat village with well-planted gardens and
hedges of white thorn.” It lies on the main road between Farnham
and Alton, which is supposed to be part of the ancient Pilgrim’s
Way to Winchester. The forests near Bentley furnished cover for
highwaymen and robbers who fell upon merchants and pilgrims on
their way to and from Winchester.
The outlaw Sir Adam Gurdon is said to have frequented the
road with his armed band until the restoration of his estates by
King Edward I. The Manor of Bentley belonged from an early
date in the Bth century to the Bishop of Winchester, and in 1086
the following assessment of this land is recorded:
T? e . re ’ s land for ten ploughs; in the demesne there are two ploughs;
17 villeins and five bordars (tenants) with eight ploughs. There are
four serfs and one mill worth ten shillings, and ten acres of meadow.
To the north of the village stands a 12th-century church.
Hampshire, a county of low hills, rolling downs and fertile
valleys, is famous for its woodland scenery, and has long been
associated with the Montgomery family. In 1465 Sir Thomas
Montgomery was one of the most eminent men of his time, stand-
ing high in the favour of three successive kings—Edward IV (1461-
1483); Richard 111 (1483-1485); Henry VII (1485-1509). Sir
Thomas Montgomery died in 1489, leaving his estate at Chalton,
near Petersfield, about 13 miles from Alton, to his sister Alice, wife
of Edward Wiseman.
Hampshire was the original Wessex described in the novels of
Thomas Hardy, and was the county which formed the nucleus of
the later Kingdom of England. Izaak Walton is an immortal
memory along the river banks of Hampshire. It is the county of
Gilbert White, the celebrated author of “The Natural History of
Selborne,” and it is the county which claims to be the birthplace
of cricket.

THREE NOVELS .
fvU-stebn temporary English novels are
bout so; body dead or demented. Or
»a.iv ali. It is a result, probably, of
rhe tv. disasters of the war and T. S.
Eliot. igh the title of Neil M.
Gunn’s The Shadow (Faber) suggests
that it is one of the ghostly variety, one
should not jump to conclusions: the
heroine is merely demented.
Sneaking from the literary viewpoint,
thefe is a limit to the amount of time
one is prepared to spend listening to the
meditations of a girl suffering from a
nervous breakdown; and it is a strange
fact that other people’s love letters,
fascinating though they might be in life,
are generally somewhat tedious in fiction.
Mr. Gunn’s opening chapters consist
almost entirely of meditations and love
letters.
A further disadvantage is that some-
thing of the lover’s character is revealed
in the letters, when the heroine begs him
not to think her more neurotic than she
is for taking an interest in nature instead
of only in dynamos and revolution; and
this young man, a Communist, emerges
as such an insufferable young prig that,
longing for .the day when she will awake
from her trance and hit him on the head
with a bottle, one grows impatient with
the girl, the man, the novel and the
author.
Mercifully, the book eventually bursts
through into direct action. An elderly
hermit is murdered, for no particular
reason, by a man shellshocked in the
1914 war. The girl, wandering in the
woods of Scotland, meets an artist who
paints waterfalls and she, the reader and
the police begin to suspect him of the
crime. Her Communist lover turns up
from London and, in the best tradition
of Scottish fiction —a distinct improve-
ment on ghosts and neurotics —has a
tremendous fight with the artist on top
of a waterfall in a gloomy glen; a battle
with strong resemblances to the mighty
brawl in Old Mortality. There is a
pleasingly robust character named Aunt
Phemie who plays some part in the story,
and there are landscapes with the tang
of heather: —
A flying wildness, a soddenness in the
beaten earth, a freshness, a brawling of
gushets, a positive spate in the miniature
green-banked dam that wound its crooked
way down from the high dam, a dripping
lushness of wildflowers, a crush of green
stems, clover leaves and silvered raindrops,
glistening berries of the wild rose —ah!
lovely! lovely!
And for this sort of thing the novel
is readably ; in parts, very fine. But it is
vague and uncertain in construction. The
murder of the aged hermit —since the
artist did not do the foul deed—is rather
irrelevant; as, indeed, since the heroine
never seems to make up her mind whether
she is in love with him or not, is the
artist. The heroine and the Communistic
young man are too flatly and thinly
sketched for conviction; and, with such
measure of personality as they have, it
is impossible to credit Neil Gunn’s happy
ending in which, having recovered from
her neurosis, the girl goes off to London
again to live happily ever after with the
lover, bringing sunshine and nature into
the life of a man who has been portrayed
as a machine and a prig and who
shows human emotion only once in the
book —when, elated after his fight with
the artist, he believes he has drowned
him in the pool below the waterfall.
Having discovered that the young man
is basically a murderer, Neil Gunn hardly
does his heroine a kindness in sending her
off to live with him.
Though influenced in the first instance
by the prevailing affection for ghosts and
neurotics, the novelist has also set out
to write a political parable. His message
is that Communists are inhuman and
treat men and women as if they were
machines, and that they must be mellowed
by contact with nature if they are to be
in any way tolerable. This is, indeed, a
sensible and pleasant theory, and it is
interesting to observe a change coming
over English political writing since the
nation has had a taste of bureaucracy.
But the same objection is likely to
apply to an anti-Communist parable as
to the usual Communist parable; the
people of the novel become, if not
machines, mere puppets illustrating a
political theory. And Neil Gunn’s people
are, in fact, puppets, and his book lacks
the flavor of reality. It is, as his title
unintentionally warns, the shadow of a
novel.
John Pudney’s Estuary (Bodley Head)
is equally shadowy; indeed, lacking Neil
Gunn’s landscapes and fisticuffs, it is, if
possible, more vague. Having read it,
with a mild pleasure in the flow of Mr.
Pudney’s prose, which slides along with
a sort of muted wimple like the tidal
river of its setting, with some interest —
not altogether admiring—in the occa-
sional freakish ripples of the style, and
with a curiosity aroused by the author’s
air of portentousness, one has the final
impression of having read nothing at all.
This, like drinking a glass of very
watery beer, is not an unpleasant experi-
ence ; merely insipid. Mr. Pudney is at
least free from social purpose. His
villain, Lord Telant, though a rich man —
a factory-owner and commercial magnate
on the grand scale—is inspired to villainy
not so much by his riches as by the
cunning, the hard-fistedness and the
antagonism to the arts he has inherited
from his peasant father. One of his
workmen, whose culminating step on his
climb to power is to murder his employer
by exploding a pressurised retort, is
portrayed as consumed by ambition. Thus,
though the characters are sketched only
in outline and, when they leap suddenly
into action from the gentle, murmuring
surface of the novel, are incredible and
melodramatic, they are not distorted to
fit a social theory. •
But they are, quite as much as Neil
Gunn’s, lost in that insubstantial faery
place which the prevailing fashion has
substituted for the uproarious and vital
worlds of Fielding and Dickens. Mr.
Pudney’s hero, an architect and artist, is
slightly less demented than Neil Gunn’s
heroine, slightly more ghostly. From his
boyhood to middle age, the «period of
the novel, Mr. Pudney’s Van is haunted
by an apparition whom he. calls the
Captain.
This gentleman, so vague that he can-
not be described, manifests himself (so
vaguely that one doubts whether he is
ever present at all) at crises in the artist’s
life and, it is to be assumed, spurs him
to action. He is Van’s second self; his
daimon; the symbol of his integrity. At
the end of the novel, when Van has been
made temporarily blind by the explosion
which kills Lord Telant, when he
has learned that —out of jealousy—Telant
has destroyed with acid a number of his
paintings, and when he has said a final
farewell to Telant’s wife, with whom he
has been tepidly and innocently in love
since his boyhopd, the artist walks into
a mirror, or the Captain walks out of it,
and the two selves merge. Van has
attained his integrity: a process aided,
no doubt, by his attachment to the red-
headed sister of a barmaid.
' This second of Van’s loves, though un-
expectedly refined, is pleasing, as are all
redheaded sisters of barmaids ; and so,
too, is a Miss Perch, a powerful execu-
tive in the Telant industries, who loves
hats, shoes, her employer and, perhaps.
Van. But exactly what Mr. Pudney
means by the course of purgatorial dis-
cipline to which he has subjected the
artist eludes detection. One has the un-
comfortable suspicion that he does not
know himself what he means. His por-
tentousness is a mask for uncertainty.
Written perhaps under the influence of
Henry James, as well as under that of
contemporary fashion, and very much
resembling Charles Morgan’s- The Judge's
Story, Estuary wears an air of extreme
reserve; as if the author knows tre-
mendous secrets about his characters
(“Nobody will ever know the extent of
Miss Perch’s power within the Telant
organisation”) but is determined not to
share his information with the reader.
Why, in that case, write a book at all?
A more detailed revelation is certainly
required if the characters, in such inci-
dents as the explosion or the defacing
of the pictures, are not to give the im-
pression of jumping clean out of their
skins; but here, too, it is probable that
the air of might and mystery is a mask:
concealing not merely uncertainty but
melodrama and sentimentality. When
Lady Telant has discovered that her hus-
band has destroyed Van’s pictures and
goes staggering off, like Lady Dedlock
and Little Nell and every heroine since
novels began, into the snow, Mr. Pudney
peeps out for a moment from behind his
iron curtain, and the face and the voice
are those of a sentimentalist: “Into its
irrelevant whirls the snow accepted her,
poor mad wraith.”
Estuary, like The Shadow, is an ami-
able novel; harmless, slight, well-mean-
ing. Mr. Pudney has written minor
poetry of some quality, and though
his prose runs into preciousness—“ But
Van walked in the water-meadows, apart,
in a waxen dazzle of loneliness” —he
might yet say something genuinely sur-
prising. He describes Lady Telant’s lips
on one occasion as “wonderfully wicked
and wanton,” and, thougfi the description
is singularly inapt for this blameless lady,
it is at least evidence of a wistful desire
to create wonderfully wicked and wanton
heroines: who, if not altogether respec-
table, might be much better fun than
ghosts, shadows and the immaterial Cap-
tains of the soul.
And that —the creation of a wonder-
fully wicked and wanton lady—is pre-
cisely what Frederic Prokosch has
achieved in The Idols of the Cave
(Chatto and Windus ; Angus and Robert-
son). Wherefore, not because wickedness
and wantonness, however amiable, are
essential to good fiction, but because Mr.
Prokosch is able to create memorable
characters. The Idols of the Cave is a
work of art much superior to both
Estuary and The Shadow.
Mr. Prokosch deals neither with de-
mented persons nor with ghosts but with
European refugees in New York during
the war, chiefly French and English
people of wealth and culture, with the
cosmopolitan members of a ballet com-
pany and some oddments, leftovers and
bargains from India and Russia. At least
one of the characters, an English poet
w'ho plays no important part in the story
but paces nervously about smoking
cigarettes, looking as if he had been
drowned and gradually, under the influ-
ence of Kierkegaard, becoming more and
more mystical, might conceivably be
identified.
All these people, it is true, suffer a
good deal from nerves, and, being not
only exiles but, as Mr. Prokosch sees
them, representatives of a doomed
society, do somewhat partake of the
nature of ghosts: but they do not rave or
prophesy with their nerves, and they are
ghosts of flesh and blood. The wicked
lady, Lydia of the ballet, is indeed a
memorable creation. Mr. Prokosch —one
recalls the blonde Russian girl from The
Skies of Europe —has no rival in con-
temporary writing in the depiction of
women; and Lydia, amorous, treacher-
ous, dangerous, sometimes likeable and
sometimes hateful and always, beneath
the surface of gaiety or savagery, lost,
lonely and terrified —to some extent a
symbol of the lost soul of Europe—is
curiously and strikingly alive.
If the word “sculptural” did not imply
a cold and stafic quality it would seem
the right adjective for die projection of
this woman, standing out so clearly and
vitally from the pages of a novel. But
there are warthth, color and a swift and
unerring movement in the portrayal; it is
plastic writing, perhaps deriving some of
its astonishing verisimilitude from the
novelist’s love of painting.
Mr. Prokosch, like Mr. Pudney, is a
poet: a rather better one. He does not
use his special power over words to play
fancy tricks but contents himself with
writing good prose; very good. And as
he has poetry in common with Mr. Pud-
ney, so he has in common with Neil
Gunn a touch of the revolutionist: for
as it is surely revolutionary—if the term
is not confusing—to express doubts about
Communism, it is also heretical to have
scruples about admiring such painters as
Matisse and Modigliani. There is no
doubt about Mr. Prokosch’s doubts:
She returned to the couch and sat down.
“Are you interested in painting?” she in-
quired, running her fingers across the velvet
coverlet. He had been looking at the Van
Gogh.
Jonathan nodded. “Oh, yes. I am. Very
much! ”
“Whom do you like? Braque? Picasso?”
She gazed vaguely across the room.
“I’m afraid I’m rather dull,” confessed
Jonathan. “I like Velasquez. And Ver-
meer.”
“Oh,” murmured Lydia, raising her brows.
“Well, last year I had a weakness for
Matisse. I can’t bear to look at him now.
I’ve taken a sudden fancy to Modigliani.”
Lydia, one recalls, is a symbol of the
European soul: its restlessness, its shal-
lowness, its terror. She repeats like a
parrot the catchcries of the moment,
smothering her despair in chatter. Jona-
than, though comparatively thin as a
character —Mr, Prokosch has never been
able to keep a kind of bloodless projec-
tion of himself out of his novels —obvi-
ously speaks for the author. And while
Lydia admires Picasso one day and
Modigliani the next, Jonathan s.eadfastly
worships the Old Masters, about whom
Mr. Prokosch writes beautifully:
He entered an air: chamber filled with
huge Fragonards. The roc.'' seemed flooded
with an evening sunlight. Everything was
hovering and floating; delicately poised in
mid-air. The smooth voung lovers with
their opened lips, the fat, smiling i ,pids,
the sensual elegance of the tre: —all
breathed of a world where pain did not
exist. Yet once again, as Jonathan stood
there, the paintings deepe ed and expanded.
And what he saw then * no longer an
exquisite caprice but the eat luturr tal
lament of a civilisation at peak, balanced
on the edge of its decline ; * dissolution
Heartening as it is to se 1 vsite of
the stature of Frederic Prokosch rebelling
against the intellectual tyranny of the age,
and heartening as is a novel based on
the observation of character instead of
on ghostly or political fantasy, The Idols
of the Cave is not, alas, wholly an in-
vigorating piece of work.
The danger of writing about decay and
despair is that the writer is likely to be-
come infected by his own theme. Per-
haps he is led to the theme in the first
place by a personal despair. Mr.
Prokosch, whose brilliant conversations
and whose faint flavor of over-ripeness
are strongly reminiscent of the early
Aldous Huxley, may find himself driven
into a position like Huxley’s.
His novel is, in fact, ultimately depres-
sing. Mr. Prokosch, who doubts, interest-
ingly, whether the craze for ballet is
wholly a worship of charm and grace—
suspecting that it may be yet another
symptom of intellectual shallowness —has
one doubt too many. Or, at least, his
heroine has. She jumps out the window
of a skyscraper.
This is a woman named Delia, a blonde
American, charmingly portrayed, repre-
senting in the underlying symbology of
the novel all things good and gracious
in contrast to Lydia, who, to the grief of
all wonderfully wicked ladies, finally
stands for all things dark and desperate.
When Delia, feeling herself corrupted by
an unfortunate love affair with a French-
man, jumps to her death out the win-
dow, there is a suspicion that Mr.
Prokosch is symbolically sending with
her to its doom American. civilisation as
well as European. And that is really a
little too much doom for one day. It is
unconvincing as a dramatisation of Delia’s
character, a lapse into allegorical distor-
tion ; it is weak as an ending to the novel;
and as a prophecy, if it is so intended, it
is absurd.
Literary Murder .
A slip in production adds to the diffi-
culties of the amateur detective in solving
the problem of who, among all Mervyn
Blake’s interesting and cultured acquaint-
ances, ingeniously did the author to death
on the night of November 9.
The slip occurs on page 179 of Arthur
W. Upfieid’s An Author Bites the Dust
(Angus and Robertson), when a vital
scene between Detective - Inspector
Napoleon Bonaparte (the hero, and a
half-caste aboriginal) and Inspector
Snook (an unpleasant character) passes
into nothingness. At the bottom of the
page Inspector Snook sits down and re-
gards Napoleon with cold, granite-grey
eyes: —
The short-cropped grey hair added to the
deathlike...
Confidently turning to the next page
there is—a blank. Napoleon, on next
reaching print, is found on page 182, at
the Colombian Consulate. And it is im-
possible to estimate how many precious
clues have been lost in the leap.
For all that, the murder of Mervyn
Blake is smoothly and efficiently solved,
to the satisfaction of Napoleon Bona-
parte and the dissatisfaction of the un-
pleasant Inspector Snook, whose role,
for technological reasons, remains some-
what obscure. Mervyn Blake, of course,
is the unfortunate author ; and, his com-
fortable home being situated some little
distance from Melbourne and his ac-
quaintances being chiefly literary, Mr.
Upfield is able to write about Australian
scenes and Australian literature. The
former he does well, quietly, and
warmly; although now and again there
is an indication that he is not so much
building up a familiar scene as explain-
ing something to an overseas reader. But
in writing about Australian literature Mr.
Upfield is, at times, very unkind.
The murdered author is, besides being
an author —a rather precious type of
author who wastes his energies on literary
societies —a literary critic. And at times
Mr. Upfield, severely inspecting him
through the eyes of Inspector Bonaparte,
barely disguises his belief that bad and
pretentious literary critics richly deserve
to die. All of which contributes to mak-
ing interesting, if rather overdrawn,
pictures of Blake and his intimates.
Napoleon Bonaparte, Upfieid’s familiar
half-caste inspector, is a synthetic figure:
the usual efficient sleuth with endearing
habits who baffles his orthodox colleagues,
with a bit of “blacktracking” thrown m
for good measure. On the dust-cover are
favorable comments by overseas critics-
Mr. Upfieid’s books are also published
in New York —among them the opinion
of Ernest Hooton, Professor of Anthro-
pology at Harvard University, that
■“ ‘Bony’ is an unique figure Evidently
Mr. Upfield is a shrewd anthropological
observer as well as a skilful novelist.
Which indicates that Professor Hooton,
like many another savant, is a shrewd
reader of detective stories.

Biographical details concerning
Barcroft Boake and estimate of his
place in Australian literature?
The son of an Irish father and an
Australian mother, he was born at
Balmain (Sydney) on March 26, 1866.
Trained as a surveyor, but became
for a while a boundary-rider and
drover on the western plains of
N.S.W. and Queensland. He com-
mitted suicide by hanging himself in
1892 at Sydney. His posthumous
volume of verse, Where the Dead
Men Lie, inspired by his recollections
of Monaro and the Diamantina,
showed promise, but little more; and
his reputation rests mainly on the
one powerful but morbid poem that
gives the volume its title.

In the event of a youth being
accepted as a R.A.N. cadet officer
under the new scheme, would the pay
need to be augmented by his parents ?
The daily rates of pay (seven days
per week) of junior officers entered
into the Navy under the new scheme
are: Cadet midshipman (special entry),
at R.A.N. College, 7s.; on “passing
out,” 8s. (portion deferred and paid
as lump sum when rated midship-
man); midshipman, 10s. In addition
to pay, each officer receives various
allowances. The pay is , sufficient to
meet normal expenses ashore and
afloat, and it is not necessary for
parents or guardians to make personal

When to sow waratah seeds? Type
of soil needed?
Sow seed not later than May in
boxes or beds of poor, sandy soil
containing plenty of grit and charcoal
—if possible from around the trunk
of the tree from which seed has been
gathered. Strong fertilisers and rich
stable-refuse are fatal to the seeds.
When two sets of leaves appear trans-
plant seedlings to pots containing soil
similar to that in which they were
raised. They will be ready to shift
to the open garden in the third or
fourth year.

In a cricket match a ball was hit
over the fence and lost; can a captain
demand anew ball to replace the
lost one?
No; the umpires must supply a
ball of nearly similar worn nature to
the lost ball. Only at the beginning
of an innings can anew ball be used.
The captains have no rights in this
matter, and the umpires are guided
by Cricket M.C.C. Law 4.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
U.S.-SOVIET MEETING.
Shortly before the blunt Ameri-
can “showdown” Note to Russia,
which the Kremlin, either in
malice or weakness, or both,
“accepted” as an invitation to
meet and talk over “differences,”
London’s Lettish weekly “New
Statesman and Nation” ran an
article suggesting some such get-
ting together. It would have in-
cluded Britain as a participant in
its proposed talks, and it had a
cut-and-dried prescription for
making the talks a success.
The parties, it suggested, should
meet not “with the pretence of re-
suming friendship” but agreeing
to disagree. Briefly, one side
would say how far it intended to
go and the other side would say
how far it intended to let the
other go. Among other bids at
final appeasement, it specifically
suggested abandoning Berlin to
the Russians, splitting Germany
and Europe roughly along the
Stettin-Trieste line, and leaving
the Russians on their side of the
iron curtain “co - ordinating”
Eastern Europe to their heart’s
content.
Commenting on that “New
Statesman” article, “Wall-street
Journal’s” very able Berlin corre-
spondent Joseph E. Evans pointed
out why the bright scheme
wouldn’t do, despite the fact that,
however crass a solution it might
seem, “if it could mean peace,
even a generation of peace, its
appeal for a harried world would
be all but overwhelming.” And
so great is the general will for
peace that that might be true
enough even though the proposal
would, in effect, “give Soviet
Russia what she has through
violence, chicanery and terror
already taken.”
Holding that, “unfortunately,
no solution along these lines is
possible,” Evans proceeds to
analyse why, and his comments
would seem to apply just as
soundly to any talks likely to be
held in the present state of things.
Russia, Evans contends, “can-
not and will not, by virtue of its
combination of . traditional im-
perialism with messianic Com-
munism, contain herself behind
such an iron curtain, no matter
how impenetrable from this side.
Of this she has given abundant,
incontrovertible evidence. Does
anyone seriously believe,” he asks,
“that, whatever motions of frank-
ness she might go through at a
conference table, Russia could
really turn her eyes away from
the forbidden fruit of Western
Germany, from Greece!, from
Italy, or from France?”
Regarding the argument that in
such a get-together “it would be
made clear to Russia that if she
did not stay within her confines
she would be immediately in-
viting war,” Evans comments:
“But the risk of war is precisely
what Russia is constantly run-
ning, and with what would seem
to be ever-increasing recklessness
—except that it is not really reck-
less. As the Berlin situation is
making so conclusively evident,
she is carrying her provocations
up to the point of war but being
very careful that no single provo-
cation can be of itself a cause of
war. It would not be otherwise
after a ‘sphere-of-influence’ con-
ference,”
It is not, however, merely the
impracticability on those grounds
that Evans questions: “If the
East-West conflict were, indeed,
merely a chess game, it would
be one thing ; but as it is, Soviet
aggression constitutes a series of
crimes against everything for
which the Christian and demo-
cratic tradition stands—crimes
against millions of human beings.
The rejection of any such settle-
ment with Soviet Russia must be,
finally, on moral grounds.”
Because of those moral grounds,
he would put little trust in
a U.S.-Soviet meeting; and on
those grounds also he sees
America specially involved;
though his comments apply to
democracy at large; “Does what
is happening to millions of human
beings in Eastern Europe of itself
involve the United States of
America? It does, in at least two
ways. The first is that the Soviet
Union’s freedom-trampling ag-
gression is a direct threat to the
United States as a nation. The
second and more important is
that the United States, precisely
because of its Christian and
democratic basis, cannot sit back
while a ruthless tyranny proceeds
to impose itself on ever-increas-
ing areas of the world. To do so
would be to reject that basis, to
say in effect that Communist to-
talitarianism has a rightful place
in a Christian world.”
Stating that “the most brilliant
and courageous men still alive in
Czechoslovakia are lodged in the
overflowing jails or condemned
to slave-labor in mines and con-
centration camps,” Evans insists:
“If we accept these crimes against
the human spirit as regrettable
but inevitable facts, we are to
that extent accomplices, con-
nivers in the destruction of.our
own freedom. For we cannot
corrode our own moral sense and
at the same time preserve the
liberty which derives, and can
only derive, from it.”
What is needed, most certainly,
he admits, is a settlement with
the Soviet Union, “but it can only
be a settlement which will return
freedom to those who have
struggled, and are now valorously
struggling, for it.” He does not
believe that that necessarily must
mean war: “If our own moral
values are not adequate, not all
the atomic bombs in the world
will save us from destruction.
Conversely, if those values are
passionately believed in and lived
in the lives of individual human
beings, the force of them can
overpower even the snarling
animalism of Soviet Commun-
ism just as, once before, the
overriding concept of democracy
swept the Western world, top-
pling tyranny at every turn.”
In other words, the East-West
struggle most accurately called
the “cold war” must go on, as
the U.S. Note made very clear
that it would. To make that
clear was, in fact, the single
blunt purpose of the much-mis-
interpreted Note.
Europe Recovers.
Competent observers are now
reporting that the progress of
recovery in Europe has been
considerably greater than is
generally thought.
A big share of the credit is
given to the direct effects, only
now being realised, of
U.N.R.R.A. and other such
assistance, instead of this having
been, as often represented, a
sheer waste of effort.
As reported in N. Y, “World-
Telegram,” World Bank presi-
dent John J. McCloy, making
“a banker’s glassy-eyed report
on Europe as a risk, with an
appraisal of whether it was
hopelessly bankrupt or a going
concern in which it would be
safe to invest,” is strongly in
favor. He estimates that
Europe’s population, which was
246,000,000 before the war, is
now 270,000,000, and by 1952,
at the end of the Marshall Plan,
it should be 286,000,000.
“Europe,” comments the
“World-Telegram” report, “is
thus presented as a growing, not
a moribund, area, with assets of
a rich heritage of education, cul-
ture, scientific and production
know-how surpassed, if at all,
only in the United States. And
the U.S. population is 125 mil-
lions under Europe’s.”
McCloy admits that Britain,
France, Italy, Spain and the Low
Countries have not the strength
to be the world leaders they were
in the last century. Nevertheless,
their assets still add up to make
Western Europe one of the two
most productive areas in the
world, the other being the U.S.
Before the war, said McCloy,
the 16 Marshall Plan countries
mined more coal, produced more
electricity, built and sailed more
ships and wove more textiles
than the U.S, Their production
of steel and machinery, their
transportation of goods and
their farm produce were of the
same magnitude as America’s,
Only in the production of oil,
non-ferrous metals, lumber and
cotton did the U.S. surpass them.
McCloy pictured Europe as
still having, in spite of the war,
the physical capacity to regain
and surpass its former position.
Its productive plant has need for
modernisation, but the business
possibilities are still there.
McCloy visited Europe at the
end of the war and again last
year. In that interval he found
that 7,000,000 of the 8,000,000
displaced persons had been
resettled. In spite of great
war damage to ships, harbors,
canals, railways, bridges and
rolling stock, Europe’s transport
system carried more passengers
and freight in 1947 than in 1938.
Europe’s shipyards are doing
50 per cent, more business than
before the war. Electric-power
production is 40 per cent,
greater. Steel and coal produc-
tion are still below pre-war, but
even in coal progress has been
made. In England the increase
has been from 80 per cent, of
pre-war in 1945 to 92 per cent,
at the end of 1947. On the Con-
tinent the increase was from 41
to 88 per cent.
Behind the slow recovery in
steel and coal are the curbs on
German production and the
food shortage. Agriculture
probably will have to be held
below pre-war production for
several years by planting pasture
land to food crops instead of
building up livestock. This is
what necessitates greater im-
ports from America,
Summing it all up, McCloy
found that at the end of last year
in Great Britain, the Scandi-
navian countries and Belgium
industrial production definitely
was above pre-war. In France
and tfye Netherlands production
is rapidly approaching pre-war
levels. Only in Germany,
Austria and Italy, among the 16
Western European countries, is
production below pre-war.
Comrade Vyshinsky.
In a detailed biographical
article on Vyshinsky in the
“American Mercury,” Mark
Vishmiak (footnoted as having
taught political science and inter-
national law in Moscow, Paris
and The Hague and written
many books) sums up on that
Soviet loud-speaker in one or
two brisk paragraphs:
“Unique among the upper
Communist party hierarchy in
that he is not an ‘Old Bolshevik,’
Vyshinsky has devoted 27 years
to perfecting the art of bowing
and scraping before the lords of
the Soviet Union in order to
erase the memory of his shady
political origins. In this he
seems to have eminently suc-
ceeded. When Stalin decided to
settle scores with his remaining
foes in the party he named
Vyshinsky Chief Prosecutor in
the infamous Moscow show-
trials of 1936-38. Responding
eagerly to the challenge,
Vyshinsky proved his absolute
loyalty to Stalin by hurling cries
of ‘mad dog,’ ‘traitor’ and
‘stinking dregs’ at intimate
former colleagues, and by send-
ing them to their deaths in the
execution chambers of the
Lubianka O.G.P.U. headquarters
in Moscow.
“Though his position is prob-
ably as secure today as it can
be, Vyshinsky continues to play
the rdle of a lickspittle. His
speeches are totally lacking in
originality of thought or expres-
sion, but they are masterly ex-
positions of the sacred Stalinist
dogmas. They abound in abject
glorification of Stalin’s infinite
wisdom and genius. At inter-
national gatherings, whenever
he stands beside Molotov, his
immediate superior in the
Foreign Ministry, he carefully
retreats a pace in token of
respect. He is generally seen in
public wearing a fixed smile on
his florid countenance —which is
not so much a sign of geniality
as the result of almost three
decades of self-discipline in the
role of Soviet Russia’s most ac-
complished sycophant.”
Palestine Aggression.
Palestine in U.N.0., from the
Arab point of view, as stated
in a London “Times” letter dis-
posing of the suggestion put
forward of an analogy between
U.N.O. on Palestine and the
League of Nations on Abyssinia :
“In the case of Abyssinia, the
League of Nations was appealed
to to prevent an indisputable
act of aggression and failed to
do so. in the Palestine case it
is certainly not the Arabs who
have ever been guilty of aggres-
sion. By no logic or moral
criterion can the indigenous
people of a country and the
majority in it be accused of
aggression for merely resisting
the annexation of their country
or a very large part of it by
foreign immigrants.
“In the United Nations debate
on Palestine it was the Arabs
who were in the position of an
appellant against aggression, as
indeed they had been for 30
years.
“It was the Arabs, again, who
demanded the adjudication of
the dispute by the International
Court of Justice instead of its
settlement by the methods of
power politics. But the pro-
ponents of partition opposed the
appeal for a judicial decision,
and although on this issue they
won by the very narrow majority
of only 21 votes to 20 with
many abstentions, the Assembly
chose to disregard the funda-
mental question of legality, as
well as all considerations of
justice and right, and decided
by an exercise of arbitrary
power that the Jews should be
given a National State in Pales-
tine.
“Clearly such a resolution is
something entirely different from
any of the resolutions taken by
the league of Nations against
acts of aggression and left un-
enforced. It just does not belong
to the same moral order.”
The Atom Deadlock.
The U.N.O. deadlock on
atomic control boils down to a
very simple business.
The U.S. offered to share all
its atom-bomb knowledge, in-
cluding methods of manufacture,
if agreement was reached on in-
ternational inspection and con-
trol.
The Russian position has been
to insist that the U.S. must
throw away its existing atomic
weapons before Russia will con-
sent even to begin “negotiations”
on the question of guarantees,
inspection and the like.
Not only the U.S. but all
others on the U.N. Atomic Com-
mission except Russia and its
controlled Poland naturally
spurn that preposterous propo-
sal, which, as N. Y. “Times”
says, “flatly rejects a fair and
honorable and unprecedentedly
generous offer on the part of the
United States,”
The upshot is that “we are
headed straight for a race in
atomic weapons, with all of the
dread uncertainties and over-
shadowing doubts that this situ-
ation holds.” But, “dark and
depressing as this prospect is, it
is at least better than the
mockery of an unreal and un-
workable agreement. For such
an agreement would give the
people of the democratic nations
a sense of false security and rob
them of one indispensable means
of defence against aggression.”
Dragnet Digest.
Nuts. —America’s two big political
parties are symbolised for cartooning
and other purposes by a donkey for
Democrats and an elephant for Re-
publicans. Cartoonists now casting
around for a symbol for Mr. Wal-
lace’s third party and one of them
using a squirrel, Chicago “Tribune”
comments that “this device has the
merit of proper size with relation to
the elephant and donkey and the
further merit of association with
nuts.”

No Negroes, By Request. Mr.
Truman has struck trouble in the
South by proposing civil-rights iegis-
lation interpreted down there as too
favorable to negroes. Roosevelt also
struck party trouble on the same
count, which gives point to this
item in Portland “Evening Express”:
“Note on equality and sincerity :
Roosevelt deeded land in Georgia
with the provision that it should not
be sold, rented or otherwise disposed
of to any negro.”
* * * *
Nuremberg Lesson. —As assessed by
Chicago “Tribune”: “The avowed
purpose of the trial of Goring et al.
at Nuremberg was to show the rulers
of all nations what would happen to
them if they embarked upon a course
of aggression and conquest. It doesn’t
seem to have worked out that way.
It hasn’t discouraged Messrs. Stalin
and Molotov from aggression in
Poland, Bulgaria, Rumania, Hungary
and Czechoslovakia. ‘This trial,’
said Mr. Justice Jackson, chief of
the prosecution, ‘is part of the great
effort to make the peace more secure.’
He called it ‘juridical action of a
kind to ensure that those who start
a war will pay for it personally.’
Almost all the defendants were con-
victed and hanged, but the lesson so
carefully stressed seems not to have
been learned. Mr. Stalin has surely
heard about the verdict and he surely
knows that the conquest of Czecho-
slovakia was a principal count in the
indictment. In truth, Mr. Stalin has
drawn the only lesson that can be
drawn from the convictions. He has
concluded that aggression becomes a
crime and the individuals concerned
in it are punished only when they
are defeated and captured. Aggres-
sion that succeeds carries no penalties.”
* * * *
Cost of Appeasement. Looking
into the charge that the U.S. is re-
sponsible for the present near-war
state of things (harped on by the
Kremlin and its fifth columns every-
where), William Henry Chamberlin,
in “Wall-street Journal,” admits that
the U.S. has a real and heavy respon-
sibility; not, however, in distrusting
the Soviet leaders, as charged, but
“in trusting them too much.” The
U.S. fault “was not in failing to
take fair account of Soviet needs,
but in acquiescing in acts of ruthless
Soviet imperialism at the expense of
weaker neighbors. Those who believe
in a divine order or in a retributive
moral law may see in our present
plight an element of punishment for
the betrayal and abandonment of our
potential friends in Eastern Europe
in a vain effort to appease.”
* * * *
Wallace’s Fortune. All the U.S.
Presidential aspirants seem to be pass-
ably financial, but perhaps Mr. Wal-
lace’s roll comes from the oddest
source. As well as having inherited
a newspaper and written about a
dozen books, he experimented in his
college days in cross-breeding of com
and produced a seed greatly improving
acreage production. According to a
N. Y. “Sun” writer, “he has made
a fortune estimated at more than a
million out of his seed-corn.”
* * * *
Truman Dilemma. How hard it
must have been for Mr. Truman to
reverse the U.S. support of Palestine
partition, and also the extent to
which national and international
politics lock horns in America in a
Presidential year, are shown by some
Edgar Ansel Mowrer comments in
N. Y. “Post.” The reversed U.S.
stand in U.N.O. (that American
troops could be sent to Palestine to
keep order but not to enforce par-
tition) would, in Mowrer’s view, lose
Mr. Truman support of three impor-
tant groups: “The isolationists and
anti-Semites would dislike the idea
of any American soldiers going
abroad, still less to protect Jews. Ihe
very large group of U.N. partisans
would not understand how the United
States could refuse to implement a
U.N. decision for which the United
States delegate voted last November.
The Jews and pro-Zionists would cer-
tainly hot pardon Mr. Trunin for
failure to enforce the decision creat-
ing a Jewish State.” Effects, as
Mowrer sees them: “Without the
pro-Zionists’ votes, it is ’believed that
the Democrats cannot possibly carry
the crucial State of New York. With-
out the U.N. partisans, it is likely to
be snowed under in big States like
Pennsylvania and Illinois.” It accounts
completely for Mr. Truman’s further
surprising twist in proclaiming U.S.
“recognition” of the Jewish State of
Israel.

Russia Unready. —Nothing is being
more widely counted on in the U-S.
to act against early war than that
Russia is nowhere near ready for one.
As a merely typical example, N. j •
“Times” military writer Hanson W.
Baldwin wound up a long series of
articles examining the present Soviet
military position with the finding that
“indications, figures and estimates
added up to “a picture of considerable
Russian military mass strength, backed
up by an increasing Soviet economic-
military potential, there are man>
weaknesses; the Russian navy is very
weak, and the Russian air force, with
an undeveloped concept of air
power, is strong in numbers but in-
ferior qualitatively. Russia’s strength
is primarily the strength of her large
ground forces; she is maintaining
under arms far more men and
divisions than the Western Powers,
and she could probably mobilise
additional units more rapidly than
we could.” He concluded that there
was no doubt Russia was “preparing
for a future war, and while doing it
she is keeping her military forces
strong,” but “her economic-industrial
plans indicate long-term preparation,
not preparation for an immediate
emergency,”

WHAT A MOB!
Australians interested in what goes on
in North America have noted Mr. Tru-
man’s expectation of a surplus of over
seven thousand million dollars (actually
$7,482,000,000) for the financial year to
June 30 and the income-tax reductions
forced on his Cabinet by Congress,
which in the same session voted astrono-
mical amounts for European recovery
and for armaments. They have noted
also the Canadian Finance Minister’s
announcement of a surplus of 670 million
dollars for the year to March 31, the
unassailable argument by which he justi-
fied it and the one anticipated for
1948-49, 549 million dollars^—“substantial
surpluses are needed to check inflation
and to redeem the national debt as
quickly as possible”—and the tax-relief
he promised:
The 8 per cent, sales tax will be removed
from nearly all food. The amusement and
totalisator taxes will be repealed. Personal
and corporation taxes remain unchanged.
Those taxes were reduced in 1946-47
(so were the corresponding taxes in New
Zealand), when Canada’s gifts to all its
war partners, Australia among them,
were reckoned at 7617 million dollars.
Why do we never get anything even
faintly resembling these North American
Budgets from Mr. Chifley? Why does
he never recommend big annual surpluses
as a check on inflation, instead of going
round the country with his silly stuff about
permanent Canberra control of prices and
charges being the only check really
needed? Why, except for an occasional
whining appeal to the “uncrucified”
workers, does he fail to come out for full
production, instead of fiddling about while
.production goes from bad to worse, with
coal, steel, manufactures dependent on
both and nearly everything else down,
except lottery and betting tickets and
“Labor” literature? There has been no
failure on the production front in Canada
and the United States. Their production is
magnificent, and this is reflected not only
in the noble aid they have given and
are giving to war-stricken peoples but in
their great national revenues. Mr. Chifley
has himself had great national revenues,
mainly the produce of terrific taxation
which stifles incentive and reduces elderly
people, who hoped to make some pro-
vision against retirement and bad times,
to despair; and they are squandered as
if there were no bottom to the public
purse and no limit to the individual’s
capacity to pay.
Commonwealth tax-revenue amounted
to £69,048,400 in 1937-38 and to
£74,036,800 in 1938-39. In 1946-47, allow-
ing £40,000,000 for income tax taken
over from the States (anyway, that is
what they received that year, previous “re-
imbursements” being £34,255,000), it
reached £380,909,300, which was
£26,209,300 in excess of Mr. Chifley’s
estimate —his estimates are always ex-
ceeded. Expenditure of tax-revenue
totalled £311,586,200; the estimate was
£283,775,000. Expenditure of revenue
from all sources (£29,802,200 came from
the Post Office) totalled £450,000,000,
leaving “a gap to be financed from Loan
Fund” (Mr. Chifley’s glozing expres-
sion) of £38,000,000. How did the “gap”
come about? Recorded and undisputed
facts as to Mr, Ward’s Ministerial
methods, together with the trebling of
Commonwealth Government employees
during the war years and since—and
other great increases are in prospect —
furnish a clue.
Mr. Ward has been represented in a
partial press not only as a sea-green in-
corruptible but as an administrative
genius. One sentimental panegyrist
discovered that he had been cradled into
public life, and the eminence reserved
for “Labor” geniuses, by crool wrong,
having been thrown on a cold world,
“a barefooted boy,” by the 1917 strike
—though he was 18 then, the A.I.F.
was desperately short of reinforcements
and was plenty of work for 18-year-
olds, even those who had conscientious
or other objections to serving in “Eng-
land’s war,” as Mr. Ward has defiantly
said he had. If any lad of 18 or 19 went
unshod in Sydney after Passchendaele and
Villers-Bretonneux it must have been by
his own deliberate choice. Another scribe
was afforded' first-hand evidence of his
hero’s way of dealing with callers and
giving telephone directions, presumably to
his press-agent (“Delete those words and
substitute these”), and he left devoured
with admiration.
“Ah, broken is the golden bowl, the
spirit fled for ever.” The fierce light that
beat on Mr. Ward’s office for days and
weeks together, at “Central” and Darling-
hurst Quarter Sessions, showed that it
was nothing like what fancy painted it.
Pothpen and broiled bones excepted, it
resembled nothing so much as one of
those Liberty Halls of the Irish squire-
archy racily described by Lever and other
novelists of the period.
Garden’s statement that he had the
run of Mr. Ward’s office for four years
after his pal and patron had been trans-
ferred by Mr. Curtin to External Terri-
tories and Transport, accused remaining
“liaison officer” to Mr. Holloway (Labor
and National Service), was confirmed by
Mr. J. R. Donovan, a witness for the
Crown, in the latter’s own words. Dealing
with the time when he was Mr. Ward’s
private secretary —he is now one of Dr.
Evatt’s 16 Conciliation Commissioners
dispensing the quack medicine labelled
“streamlined arbitration” —Mr. Donovan
said Garden was treated as “one of the
staff.” Also “one of the staff” was
Mr. L. E, Balmer, “assistant private
secretary to Mr. Ward for six years and
a half.” Mr. Balmer “remembered
signing ‘E. J. Ward’ on a letter dated
June 2, 1947, and addressed ‘Dear
Jock,’ ” his Ministerial boss being then
abroad: —
Judge Stacy: Is it not rather serious to
put someone else’s name on a thing for
which you had no authority? It would
have been very easy to tell Mr. Garden to
look at the letter —he was only across the
passage. Putting the Minister’s signature
on it, didn’t it occur to you it might be
shown to other people?—l didn’t give it
any thought.
Mr. Isaacs (for the defence): Did you
tell Mr. Ward you had signed the letter?
—I didn’t see him till four months later,
and then I had forgotten about it.
Another with the entrde to Mr. Ward’s
office, and “one of the staff” after he had
ceased to be a counter-hand in the N.S.W.
Government Tourist Bureau, was Mr.
Bill Urquhart. Always high in Mr.
Ward’s favor, Mr. Urquhart was ap-
pointed National Service Officer at Glebe,
and then at Newtown, going from New-
town to a managing-directorship at a
typewriter-agency concern, Sydney Pin-
combes, a position which Mr. Ward had
declined, saying “politics” was his
“game,” and worth £2500 a year accord-
ing to the reckoning of Mr. Isaacs. By an
odd coincidence “Bill” got his first pay
from Pincombes on the very day, July 1,
1946, he applied—successfully—for an
import - procurement licence for a
Swedish make of typewriter—Pincombes
had “lost the Royal typewriter agency”—
through Mr. Ward. Dick Keane, post-
humously known as the Dollar King, had
for nearly five years dealt with import-
procurement licences, but in April, 1946,
had gone to his account.
Mr. Urquhart confessed to a little dif-
ficulty arising out of his National Service
administration. Instructions were issued
that “certain barmaids were not to be
called up.” They came from “the head
office,” and there was an inquiry, but
“the complaint was disallowed”:
Mr. Isaacs: Your salary at Newtown? —
Somewhere between £5OO and £6OO a year,
with £lOO or £2OO a year overtime.
While there you developed a number of
bank accounts —six, wasn’t it? —There may
have been. *
During a period of two years deposits
in your cheque account amounted to about
£29,000? —Yes, but it was never more than
£3OOO in credit. I used to withdraw £5OO
or £6OO on a Friday and bank on the
Monday. I have wagered in hundreds in
the Leger and on the Flat. The Minister’s
wife shared in one of the coups.
An alarming mortality among Flat book-
makers was feared as a result of this
revelation, for Flat bookmakers are not
obliged to lay more than the odds to
£1 ; but the death statistics show no
noticeable change. By another odd
coincidence the Sydney Turf Club, Mr.
McKell’s foundation, was moved to sug-
gest that Leger bookmakers would im-
peril their licences if they didn’t stop
limiting their liabilities to a “hundred”
or less per day.
Mr. Isaacs: In March, 1945, you bought
a safe. Can you tell me to the nearest
thousand pounds how much you took out
of the safe when you cleared it? —I can’t
recollect any occasion when there was a
thousand pounds in the safe. My wife
knows where the key is.
Mr. Ward —has he got a key?—-No.
As for your visits to Mr. Ward’s house?
—I went there on Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays on electoral work —interview-
ing his constituents.
Did you always get a Government car?
—A private hire car.
Hired through the Government agency?
—That is right.
Judge Stacy: The Government paid fdr
the car to take you there? —Yes.
Witness was not asked whether the “£lOO
or £2OO overtime” at Newtown or any
part of it was recompense for “electoral
work.” Nor was Mossie Hyam, men-
tioned in the preliminary proceedings as
a pal and partner of Mr. Ward (partner-
ship denied), placed in the box. Mossie,
who got his living by hanging around
racecourses, has joined Keane in the Life
Beyond.
But what a set! Good Lord, what a
\set, and what an atmosphere! Yet
when the unsavory case was drawing to
a close Mr. Chifley put up his Minister of
External Territories, who on his creature’s
admission bills the taxpayers for the cost
of toting the creature’s carcass round
the suburbs: on “electoral work,” to spout
for writing the vast and dangerous
prices-and-charges powers into the Con-
stitution. To Mr. Chifley, very obviously,
members of his Cabinet need not be
above suspicion. He is apparently cap-
able of putting Mr. Ward in control of
the One Big Bank he is trying to hatch
out, a position in which Mr. Ward could
have the father of all safe-deposit boxes
“to keep papers in” without any trading-
bank taint. Or perhaps the Prime Min-
ister would prefer to place Mr. Ward in
control of the entire prices-and-charges
outfit, with Mr. Urquhart to keep him
company if that terror to Flat book-
makers can be spared by Pincombes.
The Answer Is "NO"!
There is one explanation of Mr. Chifley’s
appeal for a “Yes” vote at next Saturday’s
referendum which makes sense of what
he is saying: namely, that he is speak-
ing primarily to the trade-union bosses
who are his masters. The electors as a
whole his “Government” treats with
disdain, as was shown in his pre-
tence that he derived a mandate from the
1946 elections for his Bank Grab Act
and in his ignoring of explicit assurances
that the whole prices-control system
which Parliament, at the Government’s
request, consented to extend for a limited
transition period only would be gradually
tapered off and abandoned.
Those assurances were jettisoned on the
orders of the A.C.T.U., which, pointing to
the platform of the “Labor” party as re-
vised in 1944 to hasten the socialisation
objective, demanded of Mr. Chifley that
he should unpeg wages and continue the
strictest pegging of all other prices.
So when Mr. Chifley tells electors in his
referendum speeches that
There is nothing political in this issue;
He does not want any further power for
his Government but is merely offering
something in “your own interests”;
And he might have to discontinue price-
stabilisation subsidies if the powers are
refused —
these are real and pointed arguments for
the people at the Trades Halls. The
A.C.T.U. dominates the Chifley “Gov-
ernment” ; the policy forced by the in-
dustrial wing is at stake in this referen
dum ; and the most important price-sub-
sidies in the eyes of the A.C.T.U. are
those which go to maintain the inflated
wages of the Chifley regime, especially in
the coal and transport unions run by
Communist bosses.
So far as the general public are con-
cerned, the Socialist game is up. The
referendum ramp is exposed. There can
never be any increase of production, any
lessening of the absurd scarcity of goods
under “full employment” while the
Chifley system of centralised controls
lasts. Current newspapers in Britain are
daily proclaiming official confessions that
(1) control of prices without correspond-
ing control of wages is proved imprac-
ticable, and (2) the whole control sys-
tem, anyway, is only running the country
into anarchy.
To the British' Government White
Paper admitting these errors, to the con-
fessions of Mr. Shinwell that the nation-
alisation policy has fallen down disas-
trously, is added the warning of Mr.
Herbert Morrison, at the party’s annual
conference at Scarborough:
The programme of socialisation will have
to be slowed down The “Labor” party
had .started a peaceful revolution, but is
getting to the perilous stage in which pre-
vious revolutions have foundered We
cannot meet our financial obligations simply
by squeezing the capitalists further. The
Socialist programme for the general elec-
tions of 1950 must be much more cautious
than in 1945.
The revelations of failure and incom-
petence from Britain are completely true
also of the mess the Chifleyites are mak-
ing of Australia.
Of Ministers’ views last December,
political correspondents reported from
Canberra:
Ministers consider that the public has
shown itself out of sympathy with the
Government mainly because of the bank-
ing legislation. They consider they would
have a better chance of getting the referen-
dum agreed to if they wait as long as
possible before asking for wider powers.
Federal Cabinet decided tonight (Dec. 8)
to postpone the referendum on prices until
the latest date constitutionally permissible,
the last Saturday in May.
Melbourne “Age,” traditionally sympa-
thetic towards “Labor,” at the same time
told the Government roundly that “the
people are heartily tired of these war-
time restraints upon individual freedom
and enterprise,” that even at the height of
its popularity the Government failed to
win referendums on this issue in 1944
and 1946, and that the hostility to per-
manent Canberra controls was such that
the Government might as well abandon
the attempt and save needless expendi-
ture. But Mr. Chifley, even if he agreed,
has no option. The A.C.T.U., his master,
has issued its orders.
The secretary of Mr. Chifley’s Joint
Coal Board, giving evidence before the
Coal Tribunal last October—before
the referendum legislation had even come
into being—said that “the Commonwealth
hopes within the next two years or so to
eliminate subsidies which a year ago cost
about twenty million pounds.” He was
opposing a miners’ claim for still more
wages, subsidy-supported, and showing
that coal, uneconomically produced under
the Chifley policy, was even then receiv-
ing double the annual subsidy provided
for in the Chifley Budget for this financial
year. If the Government ceased bolstering
wages on May 31 the coal industry
would have to close down, and Mr.
Chifley pretends now that he “may have
to withdraw subsidies!”
Mr. Chifley persists in declaring that
the States “cannot do the job.” Queens-
land’s retort is that for 20 years
before the war the State Government
there —“Labor,” too —did the job satis-
factorily enough. Victoria’s reply is to
bring down and pass through State Par-
liament legislation that will come into
operation as soon as the Chifleyites
vacate the field; and, incidentally, the
“Labor” Opposition in the Victorian
Assembly stonewalled that bill in sym-
pathy with its Canberra friends’ predica-
ment, Even in “good old New South
Wales” the remarkable McGirr, who now
goes through the motions of endorsing the
referendum ramp, said in prompt and in-
dignant retort to Mr. Chifley’s original
aspersions on the States’ competence:
New South Wales has not failed in its
job over prices-control. If necessary we
will set up speedy and efficient price-control
machinery if the Commonwealth referen-
dum is not passed Under part 2 of the
existing Act the State Government can issue
a proclamation declaring the Federal price
regulations are in future State law.
He declared it was as simple as that to
take over. The things said to the
fellow by the union bosses were unfit
for public consumption.
What Mr. Chifley’s argument dodges
is that the effect of his prices-control is
to perpetuate shortages—and therewith a
rampant spread of blackmarketing—and
that industry is, under protest, “absorb-
ing” labor-cost increases (as directed
from Canberra) by (1) abandoning quality
in goods produced and (2) ceasing to
make unprofitable lines in demand, not
because there is any technical difficulty
in doing so, but because if made they
cannot be sold, under Canberra’s despotic
decrees, at a price which will cover pro-
duction costs. This, as Melbourne
“Argus” has observed, is “stability” sure
enough—“the stability found in a prison
or a cemetery.”
As for the administrative costs of “con-
trol for control’s sake,” and the horde of
officials whose salaries are all added to
that drain on the Treasury (and our taxa-
tion burden) which Mr. Chifley is
threatening to abolish (what a threat!),
the Government admitted just as Parlia-
ment rose that, despite abandonment of
some controls, the numbers in the Prices
Branch bureaucracy had increased during
the two years since the war (June, 1945,
to June, 1947) from 1269 to 1674, and
their salaries from £490,794 to £762,081.
This takes no account of the warren of
officials supervising rationing, including
additional post-office staff for the farcical
petrol-rationing, or the further numbers
engaged in planning and overseeing farm
production and the marketing of farm
produce.
“Yes” voters on Saturday next will
embrace probably most Ministers and
Caucus members, and certainly all
Blackmarketeers, whose dirty business
(which finds the Chifley Government com-
pletely helpless) would be wiped out with
a free market;
Communists, who, with their fellow-
travellers in the unions, forced this referen-
dum, and the policy which caused it, upon
the obsequious Canberra Ministry;
The union bosses, whose regimentation
of their unions is on the same lines that
Canberra Socialists are pursuing for regi-
menting the public generally;
. “Labor” supporters of the “socialisation
in ten years” programme, who resent hav-
ing even to submit this prices policy to
the people at all;
and any others who prefer the company
of the above.
The majority of the rest of the Austra-
lian public, those who still regard their
soul and their vote as their own, will em-
brace with real zest the chance to say
“No” to “organised scarcity,” the black-
market, the interference by officialdom in
their daily lives, the insolence of strike-
crazy union bosses and the whole set-up
of a socialised regime under what the
Chifleyites call “government”


PLAIN ENGLISH
Tears for the Pore!
Premier McGirk’s first post-Coogee
squeal was that “Labor’s” colors had been
lowered by “vested interests and money
power,” swung in behind “a city lawyer
with a lucrative practice”—a description
which must have embarrassed two Mc-
Girr Ministers and Mr. Chifley’s No. 2.
Actually, the new member for Coogee is
a young ex-serviceman who must often
have wondered in the Middle East
whether, if he returned from the wars, he
would have any practice left.
The- McGirr squeal was vastly amusing
to country people, for the McGirrs'
great possessions are no particular mys-
tery. And the reactions should have
warned “Labor” to cut out the “money-
power” stuff from its prices-and-charges-
referendum campaigning. The current ad-
missions as to Mr. Ward’s safe-deposit in
one of those nefarious trading banks, and
Mr. Garden’s racehorses, publishing
house and £2OOO-a-year income tax, and
Mr, Urquhart’s £l5OO-a-year job, plus
bonuses and director’s fees, at Pincombes,
added up to another warning.
But “Labor” has long ceased to be
able to tell a hawk from a handsaw when
the wind sits in the south. Humorless, as
well as spineless, and infatuated, it per-
sists in taking the line that its prices-and-
charges referendum is a struggle not only
between Light and Darkness, but between
Honest Poverty and Predatory Riches.
Going to Brisbane, Mr. Calwell was
heard Jp say—with some difficulty, for
he was interrupted by gales of laughter
—that “the forces working against the
referendum are out to get hold of the
six hundred and sixty millions the
workers have in savings banks.” In Syd-
ney Senator Armstrong, who has been
named Minister of Supply and Develop-
ment —perhaps because, like the Blain-
slanderer Mulcahy, he has extensive in-
terests in pubs—gave all the weight of
his authority, if any, to an assertion that
“wealthy financial organisations have
issued a blank cheque to get a ‘No’ vote
through.”
In other days Senator Armstrong was
a protdgd of Mr. Lang, being, in fact, one
of the original (1937) team of A-Senators;
Amour, Armstrong, Arthur, Ashley. Mr.
Lang was in full control of N.S.W.
“Labor’s” war-chest for upwards of 10
years, and what he doesn’t know about
contributors to “Labor” funds in Can-
berra and Sydney isn’t worth knowing.
Moved in the first place by the McGirr
contribution to the Song of Poverty, Mr.
Lang, through his “Century,” asked the
Prime Minister “why the three wealthiest
men in Australia have always supported
your Government?” Like jesting Pilate
he did not stay for an answer, and none
came.
John Wren is, of course, one of the
three. From the time he laid the foun-
dation of his fortune by running a shilling
tote in the grimy depression-hit Colling-
wood of the ’nineties, John Wren has sup-
ported all “Labor” Governments, and he
has been on excellent terms with “Labor”
politicians in four States, as well as the
Commonwealth itself. Who the other
princely patrons are is not so clear,
though “sports” should have a good idea.
Perhaps one of those “Labor” radio
stations, two of which fell into “Labor’s”
hands when “Labor” was Saving the
Country, will make the identification of
these worthies the subject of a “quiz.”
/'Where's Jack?"
By an unfortunate coincidence, Mr.
Chifley arrived in Queensland to beat up
support for permanent Canberra control
of prices and charges (designed, it seems,
to protect the poor) just when a Compen-
sation Board was delving into the financial
history of the so-called Brisbane Ama-
teur Turf Club. That thinly-disguised
John Wren concern was claiming £38,454
from the Commonwealth as compensation
for military occupation of the Doom-
ben racecourse during the Jap war.
A whopping sum —the shareholders in
Victoria Park, Sydney, also under mili-
tary occupation during the Japanese war,
and left with only a shell of a tote build-
ing, had to be content with £3OOO or so.
The one non-“ Labor” Administration
which has held office in Queensland since
1915, and then only for one abbreviated
Parliamentary term, became inquisitive
about Wren’s racecourse enterprises, and
appointed a royal commission to go into
them towards the end of 1929. The royal
commission served a subpoena on Wren,
and the gist of his evidence is subjoined :
I bought the Albion Park course for
£31,000 and sold it for £450,000, after
Joynton Smith offered me £330,000 for
Albion Park and Kedron Park. Kedron
Park cost me and Nathan [a Melbourne
man in the furniture business, since dead]
£12,000. We sold it for £250,000.
Besides Albion Park and Kedron Park,
I bought the Sandgate, Ipswich and Doom-
ben courses. We were trying to establish
a monopoly and we did not want it known.
I sold three tracks to the Victorian Trot-
ting Association on the same terms as I
sold Albion Park. It is probably true that
I have taken between £200,000 and £300,000
out of Albion Park alone.
Albion Park and Deagon (these names
become embarrassing) were “sold” to the
Brisbane Amateur Turf Club, of which
Daniel James O’Mara is now chairman.
Of the £450,000 agreed upon, £400,000
was for goodwill (“A wicked thing,” said
A. L. Bennett, K.C., appearing for the
Commonwealth). The financial side of
the business, and associated business, was
related by Mr. O’Mara to the Compen-
sation Board by the questions-and-
answers route:
There was to be a deposit of £lO,OOO? —
I don’t know about that.
The rest was payable at £4OOO a month,
without interest if there was no default? —
Yes.
The B.A.T.C. defaulted immediately?—
I don’t know. The payments were not
kept up.
Concerning Doomben Park Recreations,
Ltd.?—The B.A.T.C. paid it £6OOO a year
during the whole period of the military
occupation [“Wren and Nathan got every-
thing,” Bennett, K.C., said].
Who are the shareholders in Doomben
Park? —The substantial shareholders are
John Wren, Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Hannan,
daughters of Nathan. Wren has 48,000
£1 shtyes, the ladies 24,000 apiece.
From whom did the club buy Albion
Park? —From Wren and Nathan.
The Doomben Park syndicate sold out to
the John Wren syndicate, did it not? —It
sold its shares to Wren, or to a man named
Drew, who transferred to Wren.
The syndicate bought the Doomben Park
course for £14,504 and sold for £30,010? —
I have not these figures; the £30,000 was
nominal. The 1947 valuation was £21,000.
Returning to the B.A.T.C, the chair-
man said:
Between 1943 and 1944 the share issue
rose from £49,507 to £llO,OOO, the increase
being to get necessary funds. Money was
borrowed from Wren and Nathan, and
these shares were allocated in payment of
their debts. The money was used to make
course improvements.
It is not altogether clear, but no doubt
John Wren can see his way through the
question, as Dr. Johnson used to
say. As for the “three tracks I sold to
the Victorian Trotting Association on the
same terms as I sold Albion Park,” the
Victorian Trotting Association, as a pro-
prietary racing concern, is now doomed
by the Hollway Government, under sen-
tence pronounced last week; but there
is no reason to suppose that John Wren
will suffer in any way. And while he re-
mains above ground he will assist
“Labor” to promote enlightenment and
self-reliance as he works out the old
“Labor” aspiration, now gone to the bow-
wows.
A Woman and Her Home.
Most of these reformers, benevolent and
otherwise, remain blind to human nature,
and particularly to female human
nature. None of them appreciates the
fact that if “an Englishman’s home is
his castle,” that same home to the Eng-
lishman’s wife is at once a refuge, a
domain and a fortress. It is her job to
keep it and protect it as well as rule it,
and whether she makes a good or bad
job of it she resents interference. Her
in-laws frequently feel this resentment,
but her opposition to them is mild com-
pared with her opposition to official
attempts to “reform” her housekeeping.
Which is why that genial soul, Lord
Beveridge, was on very dubious grounds
when he told a Canberra gathering
that among other things needed to “pro-
vide a 40-hour week for housewives”
were community housing-groups, com-
munal kitchens, restaurants, laundries and
nurseries. The average housewife asks
no 40-hour week; all she does ask is
that before vote-hunting politicians
order 40-hour weeks in industry the
effects upon her be studied. In this
country it is plain enough now that the
cumulative effects of 40-hour week, go-
slow, strikes and the rest of it hit the
housewife harder than anybody else.
As for these communal notions, they
cut right across the housewife’s ideals of
running a home. She has a deep-rooted
desire to have her home and its prob-
lems to herself. Every one of her num-
ber who has had to share a laundry or
kitchen becomes determined never to do

it again. The good housewife is as keen
to keep her home as she is to keep her
husband and children, and in this she is
supporting the main prop of our way of
life —the family.
Next Saturday she is required to say
whether or no the Chifley Government
will have the permanent power to fix
prices of the goods she buys. If she says
“Yes” she takes the first step in handing
her family over to the cold and aloof
rule of the official, and if she does it she
becomes merely a chattel in the Socialist
set-up.
A Winner.
To highlight the delights of their Golden
Age, New Order or whatever it is that
restricts our every activity and adds daily
to the numbers of neurotics in the com-
munity, our “Labor” masters persistently
paint a picture that presents the years
immediately prior to their taking office
as a period unequalled since the Dark
Ages in misery, squalor and social de-
gradation. To listen to the average
“Labor” Minister speak about the “bad
old days” of 1939 one would think that
Factory Acts, anti-sweating legislation,
abolition of child labor, wage-fixing
machinery, old-age pensions, universal
suffrage and freedom of contract had
never been heard of until “Labor”
climbed on to the Treasury Benches in
1941.
Myths repeated often enough tend
to become accepted as fact, and it might
be well to consider just what was the
position of this country in 1939, as com-
pared with today. The population was
not starving ; it was not in rags. Families
in low-income groups were as well fed,
well clothed and as healthy as their
opposite numbers in any country on
earth. There was no housing shortage.
A young couple seeking a home could
take their choice of a dozen letting pro-
positions in any suburb. If they wished
to build, finance could be arranged on
easy terms and the builder could get his
materials and go ahead with the house
CONSOLATION.
“Even if Attlee doesn’t like us, and Truman has snubbed you, remember, Joe, what Eddie Ward said: ‘More

right away. There was no rationing, no
shortages.
Unemployment had been reduced to
small dimensions and was steadily falling.
The birthrate was rising. The depression
was years away in the background, and
it was recognised that Australia had been
the first country to show signs of recovery
from the disaster which is accepted as
a world catastrophe by everyone except
“Labor,” whose book it suits to pretend
that the depression was a local affair
engineered by the enemies of “Labor.”
Taken all round, there can be few
people who were not happier in 1939
than today, and few who, despite the big
increase in nominal wages, were not
financially better off. “Labor” cannot
deny this, but it will not admit it.
If Mr. Chifley doubts the truth of it
he can easily conduct a test. Instead of
putting his prices referendum next Satur-
day let him ask the people the simple
question, “Would you like a return to the
conditions of 1939?” The result would
be a 90 p.c. vote for “Yes.” The other
10 p.c. would be made up of black-
marketers, those in superfluous Socialist
jobs, and “fellow-travellers.”
POLITICAL POINTS
Communists, blackmarketeers and
racketeers will all vote “Yes” on Saturday.
That should be enough for people who
realise that this is a British Common-
wealth and can go forward only on
British Commonwealth lines.
Garden was convicted on the forgery
charge and sentenced to three years’ hard
labor. The conspiracy charge remains,
though Martin, the State Attorney-
General, is “to consider whether he will
file a bill” ; and there is talk of other pro-
ceedings—not criminal.
In the earlier hearing of the Garden case
it was alleged that on the night Ward’s
former preceptor and pal—they were as
thick as mud for many years—was
committed for trial Ward attended a
celebration party at Collaroy. Allegation
denied, though there was some conflict
of memory over just who rode in the
Ministerial car to Collaroy. Last Friday,
when Garden was found guilty. Ward was
billed to speak at King’s Cross for the
prices-and-charges imposition. A cold,
influenza or laryngitis kept him away.
There were regretted non-appearances
at the trial which ended in Garden, who
ran the Communist party in N. S. Wales
till he changed easily to “Labor,” being
consigned to a capitalist jail for three
years. People who packed the court
every day the trial lasted would have
liked to have a look at Mossie Hyam, de-
scribed by Ward as “a friend of mine
and a member of the ‘Labor’ party.” Un-
happily Mossie, like Joe Goldberg’s
“very dear friend” Keane, has gone the
way of all flesh. And there was un-
satisfied curiosity as to “Jimmy Brett,”
of whom Garden said to Ward (so it was
deposed at the lower-court hearing) “If
Jimmy Brett wanted it he could get it” ; to
which Ward replied “Stop your tickling,
Jock” —no, that’s wrong: it was “Don’t
be silly, Jock.” Who “Jimmy Brett” is
and what “it” signified remain mysteries,
but there is still time for elucidation in a
rousing prices-and-charges referendum
speech.
Dr. Evatt to the electors:
You are being asked merely to continue
existing powers, not create new ones.
Actually the people are being asked to
make temporary powers permanent and
unchecked. And to forget that “all power
corrupts and absolute power corrupts
absolutely.”
Harrison, who is to lead the Federal
Opposition while Menzies is abroad, made
a good point in a referendum address in
his electorate (Wentworth) when asked if
land and car prices would rise if price-
control were removed:
Under “control” there are two prices—
the one fixed by Canberra and the black-
market one. Who believes that less than
80 p.c. of land or cars sold change hands
at other than blackmarket prices? Every-
body kpows that in these two particulars
price fixation is a farce. Yes, land and
car prices would surely be higher than those
fixed now if control were abolished, but
they would still be a lot lower than to-
day’s real prices—the blackmarket level.
It applies to other things, for that matter.
None of the swarm of “Labor” poli-
ticians and officials has yet estimated how
many extra bureaucrats will have to be
put on to handle the free-medicine racket.
Prescriptions per chemist are reckoned at
200,000 a year, and each will take at least
five minutes to check, enter on the rele-
vant forms, file and pass for payment
from the department; and people en-
titled to income-tax refunds 'know what
that will mean. Then there will be the
hordes of inspectors out to get fines and
imprisonment for the pharmacist who in-
fringes the multitude of regulations. It
will be surprising if half the pharmacists
don’t themselves become patients.
Though D’Alton is now the only
“Labor” M.L.C. at Hobart, he failed of
Caucus election to the Ministry, Bram-
ich, one of the Darwin Assemblymen,
being preferred. Under the Five-Year-
Parliament and P.R. laws it is possible for
the “Government” to carry on till the end
of 1951, But the leaderless House is ex-
pected to send it about its business before
the end of 1948.
There is one simple way in which
Chifley could have dollars. Daily news-
papers have reported spectacular cases of
“blue” babies being sent to U.S. for treat-
ment. Since October, ten operations, eight
of them successful, have been performed
at the Prince Alfred Hospital in Mel-
bourne on infants suffering from the queer
complaint. Unfortunately Prince Alfred
has only one tent in which oxygen can be
administered, and patients have to spend
from four to five days convalescing in it.
The few dollars required to be spent in
U.S. for additional equipment would
render it unnecessary to fly more “blue”
babies over the Pacific. But dollars are
grudged for this humanitarian work while
placed at the disposal of Wards and
Amours, and even- Communist union
bosses ; and there seems no limit to the
dollar expenditure of Friends of “Labor”
like Wren and Goldberg.
The “Northern Daily Leader” (Tam-
worth, N.S.W.) is on the track of a con-
spiracy :
A conspiracy to suppress the very men-
tion of New States while the theme
of unification is dinned into the ears of
the Australian people. The nation is mean-
while losing the benefits of production
which a splendid State like New England
could give it in our time. Dr. Page found
that Southern Rhodesia, with barely a third
of the population of New England, has
made remarkable progress.
Big-City papers make horseracing their
principal topic and obsession. And they
will continue to do so until New England
and the Riverina force their claims to
Statehood into the news.

Our Foreign Policy bird must be go-

again. Anyway the “Australian News
Letter,” a 8.C.0.F. publication in Tokyo,
expects Canberra to “desert its stand on
the Great Powers’ U.N, veto, hoping for
Russian support (against U.S.A.) to
prevent a ‘soft peace’ with Japan.” The
article comments that Canberra “does
not go as far as some in its mistrust of
the Russians.” Its “mistrust of the
Russians”? Why, the Russians have no
more fervent admirer than Canberra’s
Ward. He has been known to express
his admiration blatantly, and with wound-
ing references to Britain and the U.S.A.;
but it is not for a Minister of his stamp
to lock up his feelings in his safe-deposit
box and sit on the key.

The perfect correction (“S. M. Herald,”
19/5/’48):
Mr. W. M. Hughes, M.P., said yesterday
that remarks he had made during a “No”
campaign address at Noifhbridge had appar-
ently not been heard correctly by the
“Herald” reporter. He had referred to the
Prime Minister, Mr. Chifley, as a “robot,
and head of a robot Government,” and
had not used the words “robber” and
“robber Government,” which were the
words attributed to him.
Billy, you’ll really have to brush up your
enunciation!
The B.M.A. secretary, on learning that
under the “Free” Nostrums Act, a doctor
will be liable to a £5O fine if he fails to
produce to some petty official the “for-
mulary” and forms sent to him by the
Government, called it “an ingenious and
new form of iniquity, intimidation and
coercion.” Canberra is always thinking
up such forms and issuing those other
forms by the hundred tons.
The King’s • Physician, Lord Horder,
has compared “nationalisation” of medi-
cine to Church domination in the Middle

The Church at least was cultured. ' The
boot of bureaucratic control threatens to
stamp on a plant the development of which
bureaucrats little understand.
The “plant” won’t be stamped out if
doctors can help it —that is, reputable
"doctors. Abortionists are in another cate-
gory, and the free-medicine racket will be
right into their hands.
Clearly the national economy is
ill-balanced and the population increas-
ingly ill-distributed. In tardy reply to
the Country-party leader, Pollard had
to admit a serious fall in the produce of
land industries, starved of labor and
materials. And the Commonwealth
Statistician reports Big-City populations of
1,226,900 out of 2,055,200 in Victoria,
382,600 out of 646,216 in South Australia,

nearly a million square miles), 1,484,400

out of 1,106,200 in Queensland and
75.500 out of 257,700 in Tasmania, with
females substantially in the majority in
all the cities, and all the cities living on
the country.
Army Minister Chambers can be

Seeing that we went to the U.S.A. for

One obviously is the addition of new
States, formed out of other States and
Federal territories, all nourishing sturdy
twin loyalties and contributing to a sane
distribution of population. There have
been 10 since 1889, two dating from 1912.
We have had none since the beginning of
Federation, and “Labor,” intent on hold-
ing office “for all time” (in Ward’s ex-
pression), is determined that there shall be
none. Meanwhile population and wealth
accumulate in the cities, where the Com-
munist conspiracy is a running sore, while
the country decays.

wicked strike that deprived 300,000 Syd-
ney householders of gas. To build up
pressure in holders and mains the biggest
company cut off all gas from 2 p.m. to
11 p.m. Next day three men and a
woman, occupants of single rooms in resi-
dentials, were found dead in their beds.
Though many warnings were issued they
had left their gas-rings turned on when
there was no gas, and when it came on
they were in the sleep that was death.
Two of the four were pensioners; one

All lived in East Sydney, and all belonged

“Arguments” heard from “Labor”
campaigners for the prices-and-charges
business:
Our income tax is designed to take from
the rich for distribution among the poor.
To keep down prices we are
£40,000,000 in food subsidies. Vote “No”
and you’ll lose them, so there!
The same crowd defend Communism as
a “political philosophy.” Blackmail and
bushranging belong to the same category
of “philosophies,” it would seem.

PERSONAL ITEMS
J. F. Clack probably has the distinction
of having produced more gas in Aus-
tralia than the combined Houses of Par-
liament since Federation, with the dis-
tinction that his gases are of a more sub-
stantial and useful nature than the poli-
tical variety. Unfortunately for Sydney
housewives, they do not include coal-gas.
In 1913, a year after he arrived from
England, Clack took an industrial infant
of three employees with himself as
manager and in 32 years built
it into Commonwealth Industrial Gases,
a concern with 2000 employees which
supplies Australian industry and hos-
pitals with practically all their in-
dustrial and medical gases oxygen,
acetylene, nitrogen, neon, argon and so
forth. Clack retired from C.I.G. in 1945,
and these days gives most of his time,
energy and knowledge to the Red Cross.
He is chairman of the N. S. Wales Divi-
sion, having lately taken over from A. L.
Blythe ; also chairman of the finance com-
mittee, member of the executive com-
mittee, of the divisional council and
of the national council in Mel-
bourne. He carries his 62 years very
lightly, is alert and active with a wide
interest in all Red Cross activities, from
fighting t.b. to looking after ailing ex-
servicemen from both wars. His only
son, Peter, a sergeant in the 2/18 Bat-
talion, perished in the Sandakan tragedy.
Dr. Peter Buck, director of the Bernice
P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu, who was
appointed by the U.S. to collaborate with
anthropologist Leonard Mason in an
investigation into the lot of the natives
removed from Bikini atoll for the atom
tests, is a New Zealander —to give him
his Maori name, Te Rangi Hiroa. One
of the leading anthropologists of the day,
he is lecturer on anthropology at Yale
University and has delved deeply into
the origin and migrations of the Poly-
nesians, visiting most remote islands in
the Pacific as well as museums in out-
of-the-way places in North and South
America. In 1938 the Royal Anthro-
pological Institute of Great Britain and
Ireland conferred on him a diploma of
honorary fellowship—the first New Zea-
lander so honored.
When Brisbane University decided
to establish a Geological Museum they
did not call for applications. A letter
was written direct to “Toolmaker
Frederick S. Colliver, c/o Newport Rail-
way Workshops, Victoria,” asking if he
would accept the appointment. The 39-
year-old palaeontologist, who has been
to the remotest parts of the Common-
wealth searching for fossils, accepted and
took his private museum of 20,000 speci-
mens to Bananaland. They ranged from
microscopic cells to a 6ft. rib from a
whale. Colliver has been secretary of the
Victorian Field Naturalists Club 'for 17
years, with one term as president. As
the club’s delegate he has attended con-
ventions of the Australian and New Zea-
land Association for the Advancement
of Science at Auckland and Adelaide.
“Lower Tops’!”: Captain John King
Davis, Commonwealth Director of Navi-
gation, returned to his post last week
his old self again after an eight-months
illness. The last time he was laid up
was 45 years ago aboard the full-rigged
ship Celtic Chief, on which vessel he
first tasted salt-water, but that sickness
wasn’t for long, “Sick or not sick,”
ordered the mate, “you turn to and lay
out on the fore-royal yard,” which he
did. Although the absorbing interest of
this London-born Irish seadog is still
the conquest of the Great White South
and the charting of Macquarie, Heard,
Kerguelen and other remote sub-Antarctic
islands—of the seas around which he
is the greatest living navigator and
nautical authority—Captain Davis, at the
same time, has seen more of Australia
than most. He has helped boat-off pas-
sengers and cargo from the former Gulf
of Carpentaria trader Kallatina at God-
abandoned outposts, he has visited remote
Torres Strait isles, lived on Willis Island
and in lighthouse-service ships—of which
he is boss —and has landed at intervals
everywhere from Dirk Hartog Island
around both,ways to Gabo. The first
and only director, since the inception of
the Navigation Department in 1921, he
is due to retire next year.

was in Sydney for the closing days of

him more or less in repose; he had
already said his piece in Melbourne,
where he presented the arguments against
the bill on behalf of his own State and
West Australia, It was a job after his
own heart —he is an ardent State Righter
and dearly loves an argument, whether it
be in court, at the club or in the press.
While in Sydney he jumped into the Love
Me, Sailor controversy, then raging in
the papers, and on returning home con-
tinued to hold up his end in the Adelaide
press. Hannan was born at Port Pirie
(S.A.), took his M.A. and LL.B. degrees
at Adelaide ’Varsity and was called to
the Bar in 1913. Before succeeding to
his present post in 1927 he put in 10
years as Assistant Crown Solicitor and a
period as Parliamentary Draftsman. He
has lectured at Adelaide University in
various branches of law, and is a member
of the council there. He’s chairman of
the S.A. Advisory Committee on Broad-
casting and a member of the Public Debt
Commission of S.A.

accompanist and probably the world’s
greatest flautist. The list of the stars
with whom he has fluted runs into double
figures and goes far back in musical his-
tory to the days of De Vere, Sapio and
Tetrazzini, although the veteran isn’t
much over 60. He started very early.
Born in Christchurch, N.Z., he made his
first bow with an orchestra in Welling-
ton at the age of 11. At 14 he was solo
flute with the J.C.W. grand opera com-
pany, and he toured three continents as
a mature virtuoso. In 1925 he married
Florence Austral.
That Melbourne institution, the “Kiwis,”
which is in its 17th month of production

ever. The vocalist of the cast. Max

histrionic towel to open a restaurant in

Chico Marx portends a fresh loss. The
American comedian was so impressed by

him in vaudeville in U.S.
“Becks” on a Master-planner:
Lord Beveridge, after a lifetime spent in
advocating improved living conditions and more
advanced social services, told Sydney inter-
viewers that the world’s most pressing problem
was the prevention of war. Unless that could
be solved social security was meaningless.
Beveridge was born in India in 1879, collected
a wad of degrees and honors at Oxford when
this century was young, was sub-warden of
Toynbee Hall and leader-writer for the “Morn-
ing Post” before he went to the Board of Trade
in 1908 as Director of Labor Exchanges.
Churchill, then President of the Board of Trade,
got him to prepare a detailed report on un-
employment; he’s been producing reports and
studies ever since. In the First War he was
at the Munitions and Food Ministries, and in
1919 began his long reign as director of the
London School of Economics and Political
Science—it lasted till 1937, when he became
Master of University College, Oxford. During
all that time he was for ever being called to
act on Royal Commissions, committees and
boards of inquiry into this and that. Coal,
unemployment, food rationing and fuel ration-
ing are a few of the subjects on which he has
produced facts and figures, and the culmination
of his career in this field was the monumental
Beveridge Report on Social Insurance, on which
Britain’s fabric of social services is based. He
is not satisfied, however, that paternalism is
the complete answer to social ills. Last week
he told a Canberra audience that people would
have to learn that social security can be given
to them only in return for services. For the
incentive formerly provided by fear of want
some other incentive might have to be found.
Beveridge’s life hasn’t been all reports and
economics. He is proud to list among his
achievements the invention of “Swish” —a sub-
marine war game evolved without any detailed
preliminary study of subs. —and in 1912 he
published An Anthology of Thoughts on
Women, although it took a further 30 years
of thinking before he reached the point of
marrying one. Perhaps the lighter side of his
life might also include his two years,'l944-45,
as Liberal M.P, for Berwick-on-Tweed.
Charles Edmund Moorhouse, who will
fill the new Chair of Electrical Engineer-
ing at the University of Melbourne, is a
brilliant product of his Alma Mater, and
has been lecturer-in-charge at the depart-
ment, which, like the civil and mechanical
sections, has now been elevated to pro-
fessorial status. Professor Moorhouse
served eight years with the Electricity
Commission and 18 months at the Muni-
tions Supply Department at Maribyrnong
during the war. He also did a term with
the A.I.F. engineers and had pre-war
experience with an engineering firm at
Rugby, England.
When he contemplates the river of
books he and his two brothers have re-
leased upon the world in the last 13 years,
Richard Lane, director of Penguins, Ltd.,
might possibly remember the broad ex-
panse of the Murray, along whose banks
he worked as a youth of 17. During his
three years in Australia then —he’s now
on a visit here —he drove trucks,
ran a motor service from Renmark to
Adelaide and worked on a N.S.W. station
near the Queensland border. A few
years later he was playing bit parts in
the first all-Shakspearean company to
visit Cairo. It was in 1935 that the
brothers suggested to their uncle, John
Lane, of the Bodley Head, publishing re-
prints at sixpence a copy. He didn’t like
the idea, so, with a capital of £lOO, they
started in the vault of an old church,
working among the coffins 16 hours a
KING PENGUIN.
day and sometimes three days and nights
on end. The firm’s figures these days
sound like statistics of the gallonage of
the Hume Weir. They run into millions
of Penguins, Puffins, Pelicans, King
Penguins and art books in which two
Australians, Dobell and Drysdale, have
already been included, with more to fol-
low. An Australian subsidiary which
will eventually publish new books by
Australian authors now operates at South
Melbourne. One of the brothers was
killed in the war. The other two still
maintain the firm’s custom of packing-
off the whole staff for their annual pic-
nic. Originally it used to mean a trip to
Paris; nowadays it has to be some place
in England.
“Melbn”: The traditional success-
story of the movies may be put into the
shade by John Pomeroy, of Melbourne,
who has a £5,000,000 claim against the
United States for royalties on a sin. shell
used in the war, though the patents-and-
claims section of the U.S. Navy Depart-
ment says that swift action cannot be
expected on a claim of such dimensions.
Pomeroy is the proprietor of Pop’s Pies,
one of the best-known itinerant industries
in the southern city. -Rop peddles his pies
from a van near the Flinders-street
station, and generations of midnight
homefarers have partaken of his comest-
ibles—which aren’t as explosive as his
bullets. His interest in lethal missiles
dates from long before the recent conflict,
and his inventions in that direction were
taken up by the Australian Government
when the Japs were threatening the
country. He still intends to sell his
pasties whatever Uncle Sam does about
his claim.
Rabbi Israel Brodie, invited to become
Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Con-
gregations of the British Commonwealth
and Empire, is the scholarly rabbi who
was Minister of the Synagogue in Mel-
bourne in the ’twenties. Born at New-
castle-on-Tyne, he was educated at Uni-
versity college, London, and Balliol,
Oxford, was Chaplain to the Jewish forces
in France in 1914-18, and before he came
to Australia was an East End social
worker. He holds the rank of lieutenant-
colonel in the British Army as a senior
chaplain.
Passed on in Melbourne, poetess Marie
Elizabeth Josephine Pitt. Born at Bulum-
waal, Vic., of an Irish pioneering family,
she spent her childhood on a farm on Tas-
mania’s wild west coast. At 19 she left
it to take up photographic retouching.
One of her early poetic efforts,’ “A Song
of Empire,” won a “Good Words” com-
petition open to the English-speaking
world, and 45 years later she won an
A.B.C. competition for a national lyric
with “Ave Australia,” which was set to
music by Robert Garran and arranged for
orchestra by Canadian Ernest MacMillan.
Apart from these patriotic efforts she was
essentially a ballad writer, and some of
her stirring verses of the hills and horses
have gone into popular circulation. In
1944 she published a volume.
Into the Silence:
In Sydney, at 85, P. J. Holdenson, who came
to Australia from Denmark as a lad, built up
a big produce business, was a member of the
Australian Dairy Produce Board for more than
20 years and for an even longer period Vice-
Consul and Consul for Denmark in Victoria.
His native country bestowed high honors on
him for his services in those offices.
At 56, in Melbourne, Robert Bell Hamilton,
architect and M.L.A. for Toorak. After serving
in World War I he set up in practice, was
Government Architect in Bombay and then re-
turned to Australia. He won the Toorak seat
and became a caustic critic of the Cain Govern-
ment’s housing operations.
In Melbourne, at 78, Thomas Tehan, former
president of the Shire of Seymour and vice-
president of the Graziers’ Association of Vic-
toria. He was also a member of the Central
Wool Committee.
In Melbourne, Mrs, Ada Mary a’Beckett,
0.8. E., one of Victoria’s most distinguished
social workers. She founded and served
for 40 years the Free Kindergarten
Union, was president of the Australian Asso-
ciation for pre-school child development and
pioneered the Kindergarten Training College.
A Master of Science, she was the first woman
to lecture at the University of Melbourne.
At Dunedin (M.L.), at 90, Rev. Alexander
Morton, who put in a period as missionary
in the New Hebrides and translated the New
Testament into the Malekulan language. He
crossed to M.L. from Orbost (Vic.) in 1903, and
served Presbyterianism in Wanganui and Lovell’s
Flat before retiring in 1922.
In Germany, where he was a special adviser
on youth problems, Father Edward Flanagan,
founder of the famous Boys’ Town in Nebraska,
which was the subject of a fine picture in which
Spencer Tracy took the role of friend and
guide to delinquent youngsters. The Nebraska
experiment inspired the founding of a similar
boys’ town near Sydney.

“Jasby”: Lord Beveridge is barking up
the wrong tree when he complains that
“women want to go on being drudges,”
and says in proof of their opposition to
labor-saving ideas: “Take away their coal
fires and give them communal heating and
they become furious.” My wife is a
great believer in modern ideas, but she
wouldn’t give tuppence for communal
heating, preferring to roast her shins in
front of a fuel fire. And why not? Like
most Australian housewives-, she finds that
the best labor-saving device yet invented
is me. As long as she can prevail on m$
to chop the wood, carry in the coal and
coke, refill the scuttle on winter nights,
clean out the fireplace in the morning and
sift the cinders, why should she worry her
head about communal heating? The old
chap couldn’t be expected to know this, as
he didn’t become a husband himself until
he was 63 ; but if he is really anxious to
bring in communal heating he should
stop wasting his time and eloquence on
the housewives and go after the husbands.

“Hub”: Eafly-risers and afternoon-
strollers' in the Victorian Dandenongs
were mystified for some weeks by two
cars, without the usual identifying signs
on them, which careered gaily through
the hills at a very smart "pace with occa-
sional stops for chats (apparently con-
sultative) between the drivers. After they
had been stopped by an inquisitive police-
man it soon leaked out that they were
the new Australian-built car undergoing
test runs. Since then they haVe been
joined by two or three others, and quite
a procession is now to be seen twice
daily. The earliest models must by this
time have done a tremendous mileage,
but show no signs of wear and tear, al-
though the drivers do not seem to have
spared the vehicles but to have given them
a handling as rough as the worst week-
end motorist.

“P.0.M.C.”; In the foyer of Sydney’s
most dignified movie mosque the star
appointment is a flower- and fem-decked
fountain playing water into a tiled basin
several feet wide and a few inches deep.
Patrons waiting the next seance the other
afternoon were treated to a sideshow
which prompted them to heartier merri-
ment than the show itself, a comedy, was
raising from the mob inside. A small
boy skylarking around the fountain
astounded himself by falling in. But it
wasn’t the initial splash that split the fans’
sides ; it was the boy’s boots skidding on
the slippery bottom in his mad anxiety to
get out.

“Lysol”; The probationer-nurse was
instructed to remove the patients’ den-
tures before going off duty. Next morn-
ing it was found she had placed them all
in the one dish with nothing to indicate
whose were which. After a dressing-
down she was ordered to “find the
owners.” The patients were all on the
probationer’s side, so they entered into
the fun of the hunt for the owners of the
dentures. “Try me for size,” chuckled an
old fellow in the end bed. With much
laughing and cheering the teeth were
sorted out and everyone was happy—
except one old chap in the corner who
still clamored for his. But there were
none left. This puzzled the senior nurse
for a while, then suddenly she asked the
probationer: “The old boy who died
during the night! Did you replace his
teeth before he went to the mortuary?”
“Yes,” answered the nurse, “I’m quite
sure I did!” The senior pursed her lips
and cast her eyes heavenward. “Oh,
migosh! Now you’ve done it—that old
chap came into hospital without any
teeth!”

“Bo”: His face, looking out at me
from the newspaper ad., seemed vaguely
familiar. Young and handsome, his
lineaments at first glance suggested
Cornel Wilde, even if the haircut didn’t;
but the space between nose and mouth
was rather longer than Cornel’s. In any
case, he looked at least five years older
than the film actor. The smooth brow,
the firm face, the well-moulded chin, the
clear eye of youth—these must, I thought,
at once be the delight of a Hollywood
talent scout, the joy and the despair of
bobbysoxers. Then X spotted the familiar

at which no coalminer in N.S.W. dare
work at his trade without inviting a heavy
fine. Should I be destined in my dotage
—Heaven forfend! —for a political career
and my party wishes my homely phiz to

know the ropes—give ’em a 30-year-old
photo and let the retoucher loose on it.

“St. Lucia”: Reports of the evolution of
a penicillin-resistant super-wog prompts
me to offer several thousand living
testimonies to a hitherto unpublicised
attribute of the mighty mould. When, as a
concussion victim, I entered 105 A.G.H.,
Adelaide, in 1944, my skull was shiny and
smooth. I had shed my thatch at 22.
After absorbing several thousand units of
penicillin I became a ward boast on ac-
count of purplish stubble adorning my
recently-bare pate. When I was discharged
after seven months I was faced with the
necessity of fortnightly haircuts, an ex-
pense which I had avoided for 15 years.
“Kawt Krier”: “Becks” (B. 19/5/’4B)
needn’t have been puzzled by reading
descriptions of the apparel worn by ac-
cused and witness at the Garden case.
Hasn’t he seen the modern female re-
porter in the Courts? She is trained at
social functions and flapper swim-suit con-
tests, and* even the austere legal atmos-
phere can’t cure her habits. And by
modern female reporter I mean scribes of
both sexes.

“R.M.”: Practical jokes on the peace-
time Navy can be grim as well as enter-
taining (B, 5/5/’4B). Perhaps someone
knows the fate of this prankster. New
Year’s morning, 1946, Australian de-
stroyer Quickmatch was steaming in bril-
liant weather along the Borneo coast,
heading for Labuan with an air-sea-
rescue launch in tow. Crews of both craft
were enjoying the sun when over the
horizon aft a big American freighter hove
steadily bigger and bigger, beating out a
good 20 knots to our 12. A mile away
she swuijg to pass close to the launch,
drawing in till only half a cable-length
separated our stern and her massive bow.
Still turning, she was aimed to pass
within scraping distance of the launch.
The helmsman straightened out too soon
and seven men dived only seconds before
Hank crunched through their little craft.
He flashed “regrets” and pelted away
while we picked up seven swearing, gasp-
ing sailors whose one idea was to man a
four point seven and follow. Lucky ones
of the day were the crew member whose
wallet with £2OO in notes floated to the
surface and the cat that scrambled in a
miserable heap on to a loose hatch-cover
and would spit distrustfully at nautical
uniform for a week after.

“Waddlin’ Willie”: At last the story
has been told why the British flag flew
over the headquarters of General Mac-
Arthur when he occupied Government
House, Port Moresby, during the “dark
days.” The Australian who told the story
the other day to the Australian Board of
Missions was Major-General B. Morris',
formerly in command of Angau. When
he was told he had to vacate his head-
quarters, then at Government House,
Morris protested furiously to Victoria
Barracks—with no avail. His staff, too,
had a love for the building and did not
want to shift. But “orders is orders,” so
the party left —but not before Morris had
sent another wire to the brasshats in St.
Kilda-road requesting that the flag still
fly. The request was granted, and the
party left with a smile of another “front-
line victory.”
“Tackline S.”: It’s a psychological fact
that to sway public opinion the point to
be brought home should be presented
last (B. 5/5/’4B). Speaking of Lord Bal-
four, Lloyd George said;
When his turn came to express an opinion
he carefully and lucidly marshalled the
arguments for taking a given course, and
anyone not accustomed to his methods
would have thought that he was weighing
in heavily on that side. Then came the
inevitable “but on the other hand,” and
Cabinet listened to an equally logical and
well-informed presentation of the case
against. He then paused, threw up his
head, looked vaguely at the window, and
in hesitant tones would say, “But if you
ask me what course I think we ought to
take, then I must say I feel perplexed.”
Often have I heard him discuss matters on
these lines. He saw both sides too clearly
to be able to come readily to a conclusion.
The average person has not so cold and
dispassionate a mental detachment to
weigh matters so, and thus does not form
a true judgment, so the last side presented
stifles memories' of the first.

“Laetitia”: The stage villain (B.
28/4/’4B) whose bludgeon drew an
emerald instead of the expected crimson
discharge from the victim’s cranium re-
minds me of a Greek cafe proprietor in
a Queensland country town. As the popu-
lar patron of the local Hibernian football
team, Demetrius accepted the premiership
trophy with the prideful remark: “We
Irishmans win everything we try for,” a
statement which brought hilarious ap-
plause, whereat the Greek explained en-
gagingly: “My frens! My name might
not be Moloney, but jist same my blood
is greener than Bather Murphy’s.”
♦ * * *
“Thistlebrook”: Sydney’s Queen Vic-
toria Market building (B. 12/5/’4B) must
be in very bad shape if it’s any worse
than Melbourne’s shabby, ungenteel
Eastern Market. To my prejudiced eye
the edifice has been in imminent danger
of collapse for a quarter of a century, yet
by some miracle it remains erect. It is
approached closely in decrepitude by its
sister-building, the Western Market, in
Collins-street. Both structures are owned
and controlled by the City Council, whose
Lud Mayor Connelly advocates a
brighter, more beautiful Melbourne.

“Sen-Iah”; On the city-bound bus it
was obvious that the attire of a well-
dressed young woman was receiving “a
going over” from a group of women
seated opposite her. The bus pulled up,
and in the ensuing silence the young
woman remarked to her husband “There’s
always a hush when the bus stops.” Back
came the reply “Oh, that’s because you
can’t talk about other people in the bus
without being overheard.” For the re-
mainder of the trip those women found
knitting, sewing or something else to
occupy their time.

“Nipper”: Thinking my lamps were
playing tricks on me, I looked again, but
it was right—“ Baby’s Bottom” was the
brand on the tin of tobacco in the win-
dow of a Sydney store. Well, it ought to
be smooth —it was 2s. 6d. an ounce.

“Macnell”: Battleship Queen Eliza-
beth, off this week to the shipbreakers,
will be remembered by the Dads of Gal-
lipoli, She arrived the day the first shot
was fired at Turkish defences on Helles,
and a week later lobbed seven one-tonners
inside Sedd-el-bahr fort. In ensuing
bombardments Q.E. was hit repeatedly
with shrapnel and 6in. shells, but the
stuff bounced off her armor like peas off
a drum. One night her searchlights
showed her guns a tempting target —a
Turkish artillery brigade crossing an open
space. Few escaped. After Gallipoli she
returned to home waters, and in Novem-
ber, 1918, Admiral Beatty took the for-
mal surrender of the German Grand
Fleet in her cuddy. In the last scrap she
was badly damaged by Italian human
torpedoes in Alexandria Harbor; was
present at the Allied landings on Mada-
gascar ; and, wearing the flag of Admiral
Somerville, C.-in-C. British Eastern Fleet,
bombarded Sabang. Few Australians
knew that the British Fleet fuelled at
Exmouth Gulf on that 7800-mile strike
from Ceylon. Q.E.’s boilers and guns
were worn out, and she was sent home
just before the surrender, having steamed
111,515 miles since September, 1939.

“D. Mac.”: Cars aren’t the only things
that can cost more secondhand than new.
In a city bookshop I saw on a bargain
counter of new books one on Japan
by a former American Ambassador-
price 2s. lid,, reduced from 275. 6d. Next
morning I saw the same book in the
window of a secondhand bookshop, went
in and inquired the price. The book was
as good as new, I was told, and I could
have it for 10s. 6d.

“Camsa”: Dredging has begun at Cape
Jaffa, proposed site for the port for South
Australia’s rich south-east country.
Several sites have been mooted, some in-
vestigated ; now the dredge is working at
a position recommended by the pioneers
as far back as 1860. At Robe there is
a 10ft. swell in calm weather; at Cape
Jaffa it is calm when storms rage out-
side. The pioneers noted this pheno-
menon, wrote about it, and were evi-
dently more truly observant than their
successors.

“Dreffed”: That small boy who waited
beside an unconscious man to get his
autograph (B. 19/5/’4B) could have been
the son of an advertising salesman I
knew. He ran a prospect to earth just
as the poor devil was being carried moan-
ing downstairs for a serious operation,
walked down with the stretcher and sold
the space.
* * * *
“Nakhoda”: If there is any talking
to be done about Royal tours (B.
5/5/’4B), I can recall one. It was
when the British representative in Labuan
misguidedly invited the young Sultan of
Brunei over to the island to celebrate
George V’s coronation. The sultan
arrived in a barge towed by the Govern-
ment launch with another barge behind
it packed with 700 of his pangerans,
which is Malay for “nobles.” The Resi-
dent hadn’t bargained for the entire Court,
and the famine they produced affected
the island for several weeks. As every
pangeran bought a pair of boots, the
boot shortage lasted 12 months. The
sultan, whose capital, built over the water,
is euphemistically known as the Asiatic
Venice, and whose kingdom hasn’t a
road in it, had never seen a horse and he
raised strenuous objections to entering
the Resident’s carriage, drawn by two
enormous walers. The issue was decided
by the equines being removed and the
shafts being taken by a dozen of his
retainers. At Government House some
difficulty- arose over the official dinner,
the Brunei aristocracy having no ac-
quaintance with the customary table tools.
A true English gentleman, the Resident
put his guests at ease by barging m with
his fingers.
I’M A BIT OF A LIAR MYSELF.
I remember a way we employed to convey,
In my dim, unregenerate youth,
A courteous hint to some speaker who’d spun
A yarn, were it either in earnest or fun,
That was sadly deficient in truth;
Just a card of a kind and a size you may find
Upon any stationer’s shelf.
No name or address on the front was portrayed,
But simply a line with the legend displayed:
I'm a bit of a liar myself.
It might be some brag at the size of the bag
From shooting that homeward was brought;
A tally of miles he had sped in his car
Or a bit of embroidery, quite as bizarre,
Concerning the fish he had caught;
Or a tale, should he choose, of some Aberdeen
Jews
Whom he’d artfully stripped of their pelf
At poker* and left them distressed and dis-
mayed ...
Then someone would hand him the pasteboard
that said
I'm a bit of a liar myself.
We were far too polite, you’ll observe, to indict
A cobber of lies, fair and square;
We stopped a bit short of suggesting that he
And old Ananias might possibly be
A thoroughly well-balanced pair.
A few might be jarred perhaps by the card,
But always some humorous elf
Would take the remark with an amiable grin,
Including the inference lurking therein
I’m a bit of a liar myself.
Along with the shade of reproof it conveyed,
Some soupfon of envy was thrown
In the tacit admission, implying no doubt
Whoever it was you were thinking about
Was out in a class of his own.
So, in halls of debate where they wrangle and
prate
And hurl dialectical delf
At their opposite numbers with feeling and
force,
How often you hear —as in law courts of
course—
Some statement one comment alone can
endorse:
I'm a bit of a liar myself.

T. THE R.


“Plop”: At five to 10 in the morning
Sydney folk have begun to gather outside
the Commonwealth Savings Bank waiting
for the mighty bronze door to perform its
phenomenon of sinking into the floor
and leaving an opening for business. By
three minutes to they are jockeying for
positions—one or two casual souls are
still reading their morning papers, but for
the most they stand, passbooks at the
ready, poised. Then a gentleman wear-
ing the all-blue colors of the club appears,
and although he says no word they part
for him. After glancing at his watch he
takes up a position with his back towards
the brass curtain, facing the mob, thumbs
behind the seams of the trousers. On the
last pip of 10 o’clock the massive door
begins to move, inching downwards. The
mob can’t stand it. They begin to move
forward, but Horatius holds up a hand
and they fall back, the glint in his stern
eye warning possibly of people who have
stood too close to that very door, disap-
peared with it and become fixed deposits.
At last it is down. The guard pauses for
a second and, still without a word, spins
about and leads the field across the thres-
hold.
* * * *
“Flathead”; The old toiler in the seat
in front of me made a very delicate job
of rolling his gasper, lit it from his cob-
ber’s and contentedly blew a path of
smoke towards the carriage ceiling. Then
his friend resumed the conversation.
“They’re just getting a footing in my
union—l know there’s a lot of ’em in
yours. What sort of an outfit do you
reckon they really are, Alf?” The old
boy paused, sent up another geyser of
smoke, and then: “The Corns? Oh, I
don’t know. I think if they owed you any
money they’d get it.”

“No Sirrah”: “Standish” is a little wide
of the mark (B. 21/4/’4B) when he talks
of having seen tents made into “the latest

of your feet!"
thing in galabiehs.” Not even an Arab
could wear a garment made of tent
material. The ultimate destination of
the stolen tents was the übiquitous felucca.
Many of these vessels had sails made
from Army tents, and no doubt still have.
The ingenuity of the Arab bent on thiev-
ing was really amazing. Revisiting
Egypt towards the end of the war, I found
that the authorities had given up the
idea of posting sentries, and had sur-
rounded several of the larger depots with
pninefields. The Yankee Army in Italy
—where thieving was almost as bad—
solved the problem in a less drastic way.
They armed their depot guards with
shotguns, and many an Italian had a
sore backside after a nocturnal visit to. a
U.S. Army dump.

“Blake”: The boatswain’s pipe has a
long history ; galley slaves of Greece and
Rome were given the rowing stroke by
the notes of a flute or whistle. The pipe
was originally a badge of rank and
as such was worn by the Lord High
Admiral. Made of gold and suspended
from the neck by a gold chain, it was
known as the Whistle of Honor. These
officers also carried a silver Whistle of
Command, used for passing orders
and blown as a salute for certain
personages. In 1513 Lord High Ad-
miral Sir Edward Howard was killed
in action off Brest. Fearing his capture
was imminent, he threw his Lord High
Admix-al’s whistle into the sea; the
Whistle of Command was found on his
dead body. In days when captains
were frequently called on board the flag-
ship it was customary for them to enter
and leave their boats by means of a
boatswain’s chair operated by a yardarm-
whip. When a captain was hoisted out
or hoisted in, requisite orders were
given by the pipe. Although more drawn
out, the present call for piping the side
is very similar to the call used for “hoist
and walk away.” Even now one will
sometimes hear an officer order “Hoist
him in! ” when the captain is reported to
be coming alongside, notwithstanding
the fact that the officer will board the
ship by way of the gangway.

“Dong”: Sydney’s Granny “Herald”
has passed her century mark, an age too
old for any woman still to be doing her
own washing, so she may be excused for
the following:
* Failure of gas to 300,000 homes yesterday
caused great hardships to housewives.
Thousands of women who usually wash on
Monday had to postpone their weekly
laundry.
“Hardship,” cried the lady I questioned
on the matter. She then emitted a mag-
nificent chuckle and rounded it off with
that little drawing-room piece of Eliza
Doolittle’s.

“Neruk”: Broadley’s bloke who grows
his own tobacco to save the excise duty
(B. 19/5/’4B) had better not advertise the
fact. More than one Queensland tobacco-
grower has tried it and been heavily
penalised, and in that State a year or so
ago a first-class political scandal broke out
over locally-grown tobacco,

“Balander”: I don’t believe that “In the
skeleton May Day march in Brisbane the
wharfies were sauntering along at a pace
almost as slow as their usual working
rate” (B. 19/5/’4B). They couldn’t get
anywhere near their working rate unless
recumbent and motionless upon the
ground. v

“Zake”: Snapping on the radio-knob a
few minutes before the 7 p.m. news to
find out if the lordly
Commissars of Syd-
ney’s gas union
would kindly allow
me fuel to boil the
morrow’s matutinal
goog, I heard a
woman’s voice,
gradually swelling in
both volume and
what I immmediately
assumed was well-
done mock-emotion.
The voice, of a most
pecul i a r pitch,
seemed to be coming
out of a tunnel, for
it reverberated. I
sat back and grinned
in appreciation of
good satire when she
thanked “her dear,
dear public” for the
support they had
long given her. When
she went on, with a
real sob in her voice,
to thank “the dear
stagehands,” and
continued in the
same strain I was
eager to discover the
identity of the per-
petrator of this
clever skit on the
emotionalised farewells of some old-time
stage or concert celebrity. Then came
the final “farewell—it truly means ‘fare
thee well’ ” —and a terrific burst of hand-
clapping. I was still wondering where
vaudeville items would be coming from
on the National Station at that hour
when the announcer chipped in; “You
have been listening to a reproduction of
Dame Nellie Melba’s farewell speech
from the stage at Co vent Garden in
1926.” Which recalls that “The Sheik,”
which held silent film audiences of two
decades ago enthralled, when revived in
its original version a year or so back
evoked nothing but ribald laughter for
its obvious and painful overacting.

“Cauboy”; Shakspearean producers
have always had trouble over the ghost
of Hamlet’s father, and Laurence Olivier
“Better have it before it gets cold, Millie."
is no exception. The London “Observer’s”
film critic describes the ghost in the
Olivier screen production as both un-
recognisable and inaudible —“a mixture
of a station-announcer on the Metropoli-
tan and a series of hearty Zuhx clicks.”
But how could a ghost be other than un-
recognisable? Nobody knows what a
ghost should look like. Conan Doyle
thought he did, but when he presented
in all seriousness a photo of fairies danc-
ing round a mint-bush they looked extra-
ordinarily like the picture-book fairies of
childhood. For instance, why shouldn’t
a visitant from the next world be naked?
There is no reason for supposing that
there are immaterial copies of modern
textiles in the world of spirits. Allan
Wilkie, always practical, equipped his
ghost with an electric-torch which made
its appearances and vanishings on the
battlements of Elsinore remarkably effec-
tive. Nobody bothered about such small
things as the loud click which accom-
panied each apparition in a Wilkie pro-
duction.

“Clooter” in the throes of ’flu;
The more I consider Mr. Chifley’s free-
medicine scheme the more am I convinced
that the formulary should include rum and
lemons, since statistics show that the common
cold keeps more people away from work than
any other complaint. This was particularly
emphasised last week in Sydney, where there
has been an epidemic of colds and ’flu.
One noticeable case of absenteeism had as
its central figure a policeman named “Bumper”
Farrell, who enjoys some notoriety through
having been concerned in “the war of Mc-
Ritchie’s ear” (it being alleged that Farrell had
bitten the organ during a footbrawl match), was
to be “a material police witness” against two
young women. The police asked for a remand,
stating that Farrell wasn’t available. Defending
counsel, remarking that the case had already
been adjourned nine times and that a client
had to come from the country, objected, saying
that Farrell would be playing football that
afternoon and he “thought the administration
of justice should take priority over the sport-
ing engagements of police officers.” Whereupon 1
the prosecuting sergeant said he “understood”
Farrell was in bed with a bad cold, and the
adjournment was granted. The fact that Farrell
played football that same afternoon might sug-
gest to the N.S.W. Police Commissioner the
need for an inquiry is beside my point, which
is that, on a free issue of rum and lemon, he
would have had no excuse for not being at
the court. And the young women who have
waited so long to defend their reputations
might have been consoled with free hot toddy
these bitter days.

“Conda”; With frigate Culgoa
anchored in the stream, Madang held its
own Anzac Day parade. Men from the
warship, ex-members of the New Guinea
Infantry Brigade and a detachment of
Royal Papuan Constabulary formed up
round the bronze plaque commemorating
the recapture of Madang by the Fifth
A.I.F. Division in 1944. An American
Lutheran missionary conducted the ser-
vice, which was followed by an address
in pidgin English by the District Officer
to a thousand or so natives, most of
whom had actively fought the Jap. The
Guards aren’t prouder of their outfits
than the Papuan Constabulary of theirs,
and the brawny lines of red-and-black
snapped to the present and the bugles
sang with an emphasis that proved the
white man’s prestige is still high where
courage and loyalty set the example.

“F.S.”: Latest Felton Bequest pur-
chases will shortly be on view at the
National Gallery in Melbourne. They
include the £14,000 “Bassage of the Red
Sea” by Nicholas Poussin, a Gains-
borough landscape valued at £9OOO, a
modern landscape by Victor Pasmore and
a Modigliani portrait which cost £2200.
The Modigliani ought to interest the
moderns. Long before William Dobell
had been heard of, Vollard, the famous
dealer, was repelled by his strange figures
which had necks so long that they looked
as though they had been dragged out.
The prices, round about 300 francs, Vol-
lard thought high for such stuff. A few
years later the dealer saw a voluptuous
nude by the same artist. “How* much?”
he asked, expecting the price to be at
most 3000. “Three hundred and fifty
thousand,” said the shopman, “but an
option has already been put upon it on
behalf of Mussolini.” Reputed to paint
only when he is drunk, Modigliani gets
a quality into his painting which is in-
dependent of his distortions of form.

“Bybren”; With the hope and pride of
the Bybrens at the impressionable age
where every new phrase is a challenge to
his powers of mimicry, his mother de-
cided that dad was to blame for the crop
of slangy phrases that came so readily to
the lad’s tongue. Whereupon she issued
an ultimatum to me to watch my speech
in the lad’s presence—or else. She listed
my worst breaches, which ran to a
foolscap page of “Don’t give me that
stuff,” “You’re tellin’ me” and “Izzatso.”
“Read,” she said as she handed me the
list, “and inwardly digest. And if I hear
any more slang from you.. She
sought a threat that would not offend the
young chap’s ears, but needn’t have
bothered. “ There’ll be hell to play,”
warbled His Nibs.

“Jem”: These Atlantic cables, I have
on my desk a paperknife with a handle
made from six inches of the first cable
laid from Valencia in Ireland to Heart’s
Content in Newfoundland in 1858. The
outer sheath is made of 18 strands of
iron wire, laid lefthanded (this is un-
usual) round a solid insulation of gutta-
percha. The whole wire is three-quarters
of an inch thick, with the conductor,
seven small copper wires, thinner than a
knitting-needle, inside. It belonged- appa-
rently to the mid-ocean section—shore
ends were more heavily armored against
rock-chafe and ships’ ground-tackle—
and explains why the old layers had
trouble with breakages; there is a lot of
weight in 2000 miles of wire. It is inter-
esting to speculate on how deep this knife-
handle once lay—probably a thousand
fathoms down. After operating for three
months before parting, it lay in the slime
for 11 years before steamship Great
Eastern, having laid a stronger cable be-
tween the same points, grappled and
found its ends. They were successfully
spliced, and for a time two cables were
in operation under the Atlantic,

“S.W.K.”: In the “all-electric home of
the future” which advertisements con-
stantly adjure me to note —though most
of us are more interested in homes of
the present, which are less all-electric
than all-gas (politicians’)—the accent
appears to be on the gadget that is more
spectacular than useful. One of these
alleged delights of the dim future is an
“electric panel-heated carpet.” If these
geniuses must bend their energies on heat-
ing floor-coverings, the one thing they
could with profit start on is the kitchen
lino, which, as any husband who gets his
wife her early cup of tea is aware, does
strike chill on his bare feet of a winter’s
mom. Another thrilling item is an illumi-
nated number-plate with “the number vis-
ible inside and out,” Having the number
visible on the outside is no advantage.
The only people who come to your house
at night are friends, and they already
know your place. I admit, however, that
to have the house' number illuminated
on the inside is a great advantage for the
householder who, sitting in his lounge-,
room, likes to be constantly reminded ex-
actly where he fives.
AUTOGRAPH FIENDS.
“Eileen Joyce, like all visiting celebrities, was
mobbed by autograph-hunters.” — B. 19/5/’s.
Assuming you’ve the faintest claim,
However dubious it may be,
To even temporary fame
And ultra-brief celebrity,
Where’er you go you’ll have to front
Besetting mobs and meet the lures
Of those who mercilessly hunt
For autographs and signatures.
All’s fish that comes into their nets.
They’re just as keen to snavel chaps
Who sit at ease in Cabinets
As pugs who biff and bash in scraps.
Professors, poets, authors and
Brasshats on military staffs
All have to meet the brisk demand
For signatures and autographs.
There’s little that they wouldn’t do
To trap Olympian nominees;
They add an extra burden to
Our cricketers’ itineraries.
It means another plague and pest
To those humanity endures*,
This wild pursuit, this ceaseless quest
For autographs and signatures.
Not that it worries me a bit.
From perils such as these I’m free,
And find a certain benefit
Resulting from obscurity.
No hunters wait without my door
Or poise their pens on my behalf.
Excepting on some business score,
I’m one who’s never pestered for
A signature or autograph.

After buying-off previous competition
-in the evening-newspaper field at
enormous cost, the owners of the
Sydney “Sun” were unexpectedly forced
in 1941 to make room for a hustling
rival. The handicap of £1,500,000 for
“goodwill and establishment” now carried
in the competitive race largely represents
the earlier Danegeld payments. These
are similarly responsible for the relatively
high capital figure of £2,563,601 —which
includes £1,492,271 in 7 p.c. preference
shares, at present subject to the 224 P-C.
statutory cut. The ords. are left with net
tangible asset backing of Is. 6d. each, and
in view of critical dislocations over news-
print, the current ’Change quote of
19s, 6d. for these shares is a considerable
expression of confidence in the co.’s
future earning-power.
To some extent the market’s attitude is
based on the pleasing results which have
followed the “Sun’s” adoption of modern
type and tabloid size early this term. The
smaller sheet is not only a competitive
attraction for many evening readers, but
permits better adaptation to rationing. It
is found that advertising can be rationed
more equitably, the chairman says, and
“the number of weekly pages used can be
varied to meet the fluctuations of evening-
paper circulation.” But the new format
goes a very short way towards relieving
the newsprint deficiency. A cut of about
50 p.c., in the “Sun’s” case, compared
with 1939, or about 20 p.c. on last year,
may cause some loss of revenue from
circulation, and advertising-space cuts.
may not be fully considered by the Prices
Branch, while there is the heavier inci-
dence of overhead (despite staff retrench-
ments) at a time when costs are already
mounting.
The £202,995 net profit earned had a
full year’s benefit from the higher adver-
tising rates charged early in 1946, and
from the increased price (4d.) of the
“Sunday Sun”; a £9600 dividend from
Consolidated Press, Ltd., the first receipt
in three years, gave further assistance.
Gross profit (£480,797) was £36,321
higher than in 1946, but general expenses
climbed from 20.8 to 24.8 p.c. Deprecia-
tion was a little higher at £44,376, with
tax £5932 more at £lll,OBl. The net
figure was enough to pay the prefs. their
full contract rate and leave 9.8 p.c. to
the ords. But money is needed in the
business, so the ord. rate was kept at 5
p.c., and the board availed itself of the
statutory pref. reduction.

maintained, the weekly “Woman” show-
ing a further 17 p.c. advance;

“Glamor,” a woman’s monthly magazine

“stabilised at a figure exceeding 100,000,”
according to the chairman, and a higher

Shareholdings include a 50 p.c. interest in
2UE radio station ; a 28 p.c. ord. holding
(160,000 £1 shares) in Consolidated Press,
Ltd., taken as payment for goodwill of
the “Daily Telegraph” and other assets'
in 1936 ; and a holding of £234,048 (about
15 p.c.) in Australian Newsprint Mills
(Tas.). The latter co. will require further
contributions from its shareholders this
year for the new plant that is expected to
raise newsprint output from 31,000 tons
to 80,000 tons by 1950. The higher
production will provide less than
half Australia’s present requirements,
and the dollar situation is likely to
dominate conditions in the newspaper in-
dustry for some time. Further ahead, an
era of strenuous competition seems prob-
able as machinery and paper become
available.
The latest price of 19s. 6d. for the As-
sociated News ords. represents an ad-
vance of 2s. in the past few weeks ; yield
at this figure will be 5.1 p.c. if the last
div. is repeated. The prefs. at 225, 3d.
yield 4.9 p.c. on their reduced div. rate
and have tangible cover of 21s. on book
values.

On behalf of its well-known manufac-
turing subsidiaries—Metters, Ltd., and
Metters K.F.B. Pty.—this holding co. has
asked permission from Canberra to raise
extra working capital. A record demand
for its stoves (of intermittent use these
days), baths, sinks, radiators and gas-
heaters results from current housing pro-
jects and from the suspension of normal
replacement supplies for three years
when the subsidiaries were on defence
work.
The group’s largest manufacturing unit
is that of Metters, Ltd., at Alexandria
(Sydney); this co. also has factories in
Adelaide and Perth and a warehouse in
Brisbane, besides holding shares in
Metters (N.Z.), Ltd. The second sub-
sidiary, Metters K.F.B. Pty., operates a
large factory in Footscray (Melbourne).
General Industries itself came into being
in 1927 to amalgamate the rival businesses
of Metters, Ltd., and the smaller K.F.B.
Foundry, Ltd,, which had been estab-
lished 10 years previously by a group of
former Metters employees. Terms of the
merger involved a substantial writing-up
of asset values and capital; but these had
to be revised again after the economic
slump, and in 1934 the ordinary capital
of General Industries was reduced by
£319,071 (7s. 6d. a share).
The subsequent recovery was prompt,
and ordinary divs. of 10 p.c. or more
have been paid since 1936. The subsidi-
aries enjoy a reputation for efficient pro-
duction methods ; pre-war extensions and
modernising of plant were resumed last
term, when £70,029 more was spent on
fixed assets than was written off;

Tm finance these assets and increases of
£213,418 (38 p.c.) in stocks and £34,407
in book debts, the board reduced cash
holdings by £155,742 and -used extra
credits of £69,834 (mostly bank over-
draft). Both stocks and book debts are
entered after deduction of special reserves
(amounts not specified).
The accounts offer shareholders no de-
tails of annual depreciation or tax deduc-
tions. Removal of War-time (Co.) Tax
last year permitted a transfer of £46,000
to reserves, but tax provision still stands
£6057 higher than in 1947. That relief
was no doubt responsible for part of the
£10,650 improvement in declared profit,
which represented 15.7 p.c. on ord. capi-
tal after paying the prefs., compared with
14 p.c. and 11.7 p.c. in the two previous
terms.
How to expand output with the present
dearth of skilled labor will remain the
board’s chief problem for some time. In-
creasing costs are likely to raise selling
prices, but most of the demand for the
co.’s lines —essential goods at this junc-
ture —is solidly based. With rejuvenated
plant and greater stocks of raw materials
on hand, the stage is set for a successful
trading year. Present ’Change quotes of
345. for the 12s. 6d. ords. include rights
to the proposed new issue, details of
which are still conjectural; these shares
have net tangible cover of 20s. 3d. The
7 p.c. cumulative prefs., with backing of
89s. each, yield 4.4 p.c. at the current
price of 325.

A still sharper rise in earnings for the
current term is foreshadowed in a pros-
pectus issued this month showing net
profit for the half-year ending last Dec.
at £64,589, after tax allowance. The
prospectus relates to an issue that will
raise the co.’s paid capital to about four
times the 1945 figure.
The investing public’s interest in
Standard Cars has been brief and subject
to interruption. Origin of the business
was a proprietary formed in 1929 to
operate the Victorian franchise for
Standards and Triumphs. Six years later
a second proprietary took over the N.S.W.
agencies, and when the two were merged
in 1938 to form the present co. an issue
of 50,000 7 p.c. prefs. was subscribed by
the public. Standard Cars was listed on
the Melbourne Exchange in respect of
those shares only.
After a good showing in the first year,
chassis imports were affected by the war
and trading steadily diminished. Large
cash balances having accumulated by
1941, it was decidedAo repay the pref.
capital and the co. disappeared from the
official list for the remainder of the war.
Preference capital was again raised
publicly in 1945 (75,000 5 p.c. cumulative
£1 shares) and it was revealed that profits
for the (hree intervening years had aver-
aged £2239. Further issues amounting to
£56,250 were made last term, funds being

add £122,500 to the co.’s funds.
Standard vehicles have made a par-
ticularly smart return to the Australian
market, with rewarding results for this
co. Present conditions are certainly
abnormal, but Standards were becoming
increasingly popular in this country be-
fore the war ; the 1389 vehicles sold last
term were below the record of 2121 set
up in 1939. Besides Standards and
Triumphs, the English manufacturing co.
has recently begun to turn out new Van-
guard (16-h.p.) cars by mass-production
methods and it has extended its output
of Ferguson tractors. Each of these lines
will be distributed in Australia by
Standard Cars, Ltd.
The new capital issue will entail the
conversion of the co.’s preferred ordinary
shares into 7 p.c. second prefs. Capital
will then comprise 170,000 10s. ords.,
100,000 5 p.c. first prefs. and 75,000
second prefs.—a total of £260,000.
Allowing for the new funds, including
premiums, net asset backing will be 20s.

prefs. and 555. sd. for the seconds.

The unrewarded ordinary and “C” pre-
ference (non-cumulative) shares mostly
belong to American interests, which thus
have virtual control of Hoyts’ policy.
Fox Film Corporation acquired the shares
when it came to the financial rescue of
Hoyts in the - ’thirties; nowadays they
are mainly held by the National Theatres
Corporation of U.S.A. From profits
earned since 1941 a total of £657,590
has been available for distribution to the
ords. and “C” prefs., but instead re-
serves have been accumulated to offset
the large intangible assets and to help
extend the Hoyts circuit of cinemas. The
American cos. naturally benefit from the
established market which these theatres
give their exhibits.
About 150 picture-houses throughout
the Commonwealth are controlled by or
affiliated with Hoyts Theatres. In Sydney
the chain includes the Regent, Plaza,
Century, Mayfair, Palace and Esquire;
in addition the Embassy, Empire and
King’s Cross theatres are managed jointly
with Greater Union Theatres Pty., the
other big circuit operating in this country.

Communist support.
Among their colleagues on the New South

Now, as Labour politicians strive again for

Socialisation.
And Mr. Chifley and Doctor Evatt have pro-

AND ALL OTHER STATES
Of Sydney’s 160 or so suburban
houses, Hoyts manages about 25
and Greater Union about 35.
Hoyts is the stronger in Mel-
bourne, where it directs about
50 suburban theatres as well as
that city’s Regent, Plaza, De
Luxe, Lyceum and Athenaeum.
The co. is represented in all the
other capitals and in various
country towns.
Hoyts ran into difficulties
shortly after it became a public
co. in 1926. Modern and expen-
sive city theatres built in Syd-
ney, Brisbane, Melbourne and
Adelaide under boom conditions
became unprofitable in the
slump, and at the same time it
became necessary to pay for new
talking-picture equipment and in-
stallation. The Fox Film Corp.
came forward with financial aid,
arranged for reductions in the
hire prices paid to Hollywood
and entered a five-year agree-
merit with Greater Union to
mitigate competition. Profits
steadily improved thereafter,
and new cinemas have joined the
circuit continually.
The last important deal was
a purchase of six N. S. Wales
country theatres in 1946, No
additions were made last term,
but £87,984 was spent renovat-
ing freeholds;—

The net addition to fixed assets
was £54,108 after depreciation
of £123,421. Hoyts’ capital
now comprises 400,000 7 p.c.
cumulative “A” prefs., 450,000 6
p.c. cumulative “Bs,” 935,000 10
p.c. non-cumulative “Cs,” all of
£1 each, plus £25,000 in Is.
ords.
Box - office takings of
£2,955,802 were slightly better
than in 194£, but below the
record of £3,200,783 set in the
previous year. A possible de-
cline in box-office business this
term won’t endanger the £55,000
needed to pay the first and
second prefs. held by Australian
investors. Dollar difficulties have
been by-passed so far by an
arrangement between the
Federal Government and Ameri-
can distributors whereby 50 p.c.
of net film rentals is to be in-
vested temporarily in Australia ;
one possible use of these funds
would be greater consolidation
of cinema interests.
Both the “A” and “B” prefs.
are quoted nowadays at about
twice their 1939 values. The
“As” at 30s. yield 4.7 p.c. and
the “Bs” at 255. 6d. yield 4.9
p.c., net tangible cover being
775. 7d. and 50s. 9d. respectively.
Australian gold production
during March Was 65,007 fine
ounces, valued at £699,638, ac-
cording to the Commonwealth
Statistician. This is a decline of
5590 fine ounces, or 8 p.c., on
March, 1947. For the first
quarter of this year 190,607
ounces was produced as against
215,377 in the same period in
1947 and 367,037 ounces in
1939.

Big Cheques to Be Met
Mr. Herbert Morrison told
the British Labor Conference
last week that “the capi-
talist cannot be squeezed
further,” and asked for greater
production by the trade-union
movement. “Vast cheques have
been drawn on our future
national resources,” he added,
“but we have no hope of meet-
ing those cheques unless we pro-
duce a lot more than at pre-
sent. There is no good reason
why we should not produce
more. We must be careful not
to underestimate the bill we
have to meet.”
Quite an able exposition of the
situation as it exists in Britain,
and one which has a parallel in
most respects in Australia.
The “vast cheques” which
Mr. Morrison, Lord President of
the Council in the Attlee Gov-
ernment, spoke of are in
the main the wages paid
to, and the social-security
benefits earmarked for, the
wage-earners of Britain. Britain
has seen the creation of a great
deal more money than goods
during the past nine years: sav-
ings have mounted and spend-
ing-power has increased on a
vast scale, while prices have not
been allowed to rise in the same
proportion. Every British
country still has hopes that pro-
duction will eventually rise to
the point of abundance where
prices will stop inflating and the
savings' of the people will really
return to them the values they
expect, and where rationing and
restrictions on purchase will be
replaced by competition to sell
by industry.
That point of abundance,
however, will obviously not be
reached until wage-earners and
the proprietary side of industry
join their forces and co-operate
to the full in achieving it. As
Mr. Morrison implies, Capital
cannot provide the extra goods
and services needed to lift liv-
ing standards and restore values
unless more production comes
from wage-earners. With taxa-
tion of industry heavy and prices
and profits restricted, the bene-
fits of increased production will
flow mainly to wage-earners
themselves and to the national
Treasury, from which so much
is expected these days in the
way of social services.
The situation in Australia is
very similar, if perhaps more in-
credibly stupid so far as the
attitude of “Labor” is con-
cerned. “Labor” has pressed
for more wages, for a shorter
working week, for greater
“social-security” benefits, and at
the same time has done nothing
at all to increase production in
order to make the increased
paper-money spending - power
worth its face-value. Usually
the trend has been to reduce pro-
duction regardless of any con-
cessions received through the
Arbitration Court or from the
public purse. And the face of
official “Labor” has been set
against any attempt to introduce
incentive payments as a reward
for greater production. It is a
fact that only the comparatively
kindliness and fertility of the
continent itself has so far saved
this community from the eco-
nomic disaster that trade-union
stubbornness and mischief-mak-
ing seem bound to bring to us
in the end if unionism remains
unchecked in its attitude.
Paper-money “savings” in
Australian savings-banks had
risen to £667 million at March
31 last, compared with £245 mil-
lion at the outbreak of war. The
total “savings” of the com-
munity had inflated to £1537 mil-
lion at September 30 last, as
against £612 million in June,
1939. These are the “cheques”
which trade-unionists have to
honor if they themselves are to
get full value for their savings
when they go to spend them.
Since war began 170,000 per-
sons: have been added to Gov-
ernment payrolls throughout the
Commonwealth, and over
100,000 of these have been
additions to the Common-
wealth civil service. Only a
small proportion of these would
be actually productive of addi-
tional goods and services, whilst
many people contend that they
represent an obstruction to the
rest of productive enterprise. It
is positively certain that the in-
flation of Government payrolls
as a whole has' been a big con-
tributor to the creation of extra
paper-money wages and savings
and a hindrance to real produc-
“ Yeah , and that goes for me, too!”
tion of goods for all the com-
munity.
Another hindrance has been
the redistribution of incomes
through the medium of excessive
Commonwealth taxation. The
redistribution is usually made
on no basis of productive ser-
vices rendered by the recipient
of “social security,” or whatever
form the Government payment
may take.
Lord Beveridge, with whose
name the words “social security”
will always be associated, has
lately felt compelled to empha-
sise that you can’t eat any kind
of a cake, social-security variety
or otherwise, unless you provide
for the ingredients, the making
and the cooking.
The Dampney Cottage
G. F, Dampney has got the
“all-clear” signal from Govern-
ment and local-Government
bodies for what he declares to
be his last demonstration cot-
tage, to be erected at Newport
(Sydney). Mr. Dampney now
invites shire councils and the like
to send a practical man along
to take some part in the con-
struction of the cottage—to be-
come familiar with the mode of
construction, the type of con-
crete used, and the costs of pro-
duction and erection.
His method is to use slabs of
matured concrete cemented to a
concrete-stud framework, pro-
viding a cavity wall and a water-
proof exterior and interior. He
claims for his method the merits
of cheapness and extreme dura-
bility, and believes that develop-
ment of his plans along nation-
ally co-operative lines would en-
able wide research to be carried
out throughout the Common-
wealth in respect of new raw
materials for building—especi-
ally as regards “aggregate”
materials in each building local-
ity—thus introducing a new effi-
ciency and economy into the
industry.
Many Dampney homes have
been in service for over 30 years.
Professor Leslie Wilkinson, until
last year Dean of the Faculty of
Architecture at Sydney Univer-
sity, years ago designed a Damp-
ney cottage for a Goulburn resi-
dent, and it is now the property
of Governor-General McKell.
Mr. Dampney now wants a
team of practical men to co-
operate with him in the building
of his final demonstration cot-
tage and asks all competent
authorities to investigate and
pass judgment on what repre-
sents a life-work. He can be
got in touch with at Newport
Beach, N.S.W.
Maoriland’s Labor Daily
Since it was founded in 1946,
Maoriland’s Labor daily, the
“Southern Cross,” has dis-
appointed just about every high
hope of its founders. Worst of
all, it has incurred heavy losses
in years of post-war prosperity
when most cos. have been on
the crest of the wave. It was
£36,804 on the wrong side for
the first 10 months to December
31, 1946, and another £40,749 to
the bad last year. That’s a total
of £77,553 in 22 months, which
is over £BOO a week. Labor
directors, who can’t see the
writing on the wall yet, claim
1947 results showed a turn for
the better, but this looks like
wishful thinking.
General establishment ex-
penses and accumulated trading
losses to December last totalled
£96,371. With commission paid
on sales of shares and prelimin-.
ary exes, added, the total deficit
is £98,309. How long can the
drift go on? Perhaps only so
long as Labor, which has proved
more expert in spending than
earning, can plug up the holes
in the balance-sheet by passing
the hat around the unions. Funds
won’t be so plentiful when the
economic pendulum swings back.
Fourteen directors make the
concern look topheavy, but not
with directing ability, for only
one has any pretensions to know-
ledge of printing and publishing.
Fourteen thousand shareholders
have an average of just over £lO
apiece in paid capital of
£145,000.
Circulation of 38,000 copies
for the/ paper in the first year
didn’t put it high among N.Z.
metropolitan dailies.
The ss. shares in Comtex, Ltd.,
Sydney (B. 7/4/’4B), have had
a smart rise since allotment at
par less than two months ago.
Sales recently have been in the
vicinity of 11s. Representing a
unified holding of the shares in
Sydney Waste Industries, Ltd.,
Sydney Condenser Yarns Pty.,
Ltd,, and Federal Cotton Co.
Pty., Ltd., all engaged in the
handling and processing of tex-
tile wastes, Comtex issued
£40,000 in scrip to the public,
and £34,500 in scrip, plus £6526
in cash, to the vendors. Net
tangible assets acquired had a
book value of about £17,000,
but 1946-47 combined earnings
were equal to slightly more than
18 p.c. on the proposed new
capitalisation, which would pro-
vide £31,474 of additional work-
ing capital.

REMEMBER THE PLOUGHSHARE !
lii Ancient Greece a farm boy, Glaucus, astounded
his father by using his closed fist as a hammer on a
broken ploughshare. His father was so impressed
that he took Glaupus to the Olympic Games as a
boxer. Glaucus, insufficiently trained, was almost
defeated in the final bout, but his father shouted,
Glaucus! Remember the ploughshare!” Rallying,
Glaucus delivered one mighty blow and won the
championship. In his later years he was considered
the greatest boxer of all time.

From Herbert Holman
Disunity
At no time since the general
election have the internal affairs
of the Labor party figured so
prominently in the news as dur-
ing recent weeks. The acts and
expressed opinions of members
of its various factions have laid
bare party quarrels and set them
in high relief. The result is as
bewildering to the general public
as it must be embarrassing to
Transport House. Labor pres-
tige, which outside its own circles
has steadily been falling, is
lower than ever.
To a nation which still has a
Dunkirk spirit in reserve, the
immediate need is strong leader-
ship ; and a good leader’s first
thought is to establish unity of
purpose. As the months pass
disillusionment grows, particu-
larly among those who thought
in 1945 that it was time for a
change. It becomes more and
more evident that the present
Government represents rather
than, governs: that is to say, it
represents a body of supporters
to which it owes a too-compel-
ling allegiance, rather as if it
had come to power under a
mortgage*
The action of the Labor Ex-
ecutive in expelling Platts-Mills
(who to ordinary people seems
to define that vague expression
fellow-traveller”) was welcomed
by the nation in general. Simi-
larly, Attlee’s plain words to the
extreme Left to make their
choice between the Labor and
Communist parties seemed timely
and reasonable. But the sig-
nificance of these words was
manifestly dulled by the clumsy
attempt at counterbalance in
warning the Right that “it would
be undesirable” for Labor Ms P
to attend the United Europe
Conference at the Hague.
Nationalisation
For reasons that would be
anything but a comfort to him,
reports of Mr. Shinwell’s
speeches have an instant appeal,
especially to the hearing of those
w ho don’t matter a tinker’s
cuss.” His remarks at the Co-
operative Congress in Edin-
burgh caused some astonished
blinking, for he hasn’t yet built
up a reputation for coming out
with home-truths.
Of the nationalisation of the
mining industry he remarked:
We thought we knew all about
it. The fact of the matter was
we did not.” In words other
than these he admitted that
they had tried to do too much.
too quickly and with too little
preparation.
Socialism, he said, demanded
the nationalisation of key in-
dustries and services because, if
“they” could secure control of
the administration, “they” could
readjust the fabric of society to
the advantage of the common
people.
To one who professes no claim
either to the uncommon or to
inner knowledge of the work-
ings of the newly-nationalised
industries, but who merely has
to pay the bills, the “advantage”
seems hard to discover. In hard
cash a ton of coal costs more
than twice as much as it did be-
fore the war. It scarcely looks
like the coal we knew in the
“bad” old days of private enter-
prise. Its higher cost is not only
to be measured in cash, as is
shown when the major problem
of the disposal of the generous
residue of ash and stone has to
be considered.
To light the fire calls for the
intuitive skill of an aboriginal,
and the result seems to give the
lie to the proverb that there can
be no smoke without fire. And
there’s no redress. For too
obvious reasons the harassed
consumer daren’t raise a storm
in the coal-merchant’s office;
and he must always behave very
cordially towards the coalman.
All in all, he must rest thankful
for what he has got.
With the railways, trains are
slower, more crowded and less
clean. The number of serious
accidents has been alarming.
And, of course, fares have gone
up.
State-owned airways have
published their own revealing
accounts. Here, by way of ex-
ception, the “consumer” is at an
advantage, for he gets his trip
at less than cost price. It is
the poor fellow on the ground
below who has to subsidise him
on his trip.
To the man who has to pay
the bills it would seem prudent,
especially in view of Mr. Shin-
well’s admissions, to put in order
those industries already under
State control before turning to
the gas industry, to other sec-
tions of transport and, maybe,
to steel.
Blessed Plot
The happy ending of the
Kirby family’s ordeal is as much
due to public opinion as it is
to Mr. Kirby’s own stubborn
defiance. What matters most is
that his home still stands.
Mr. Kirby, who was bombed-
out in 1940, bought a plot of
land at Bracknell, Berks, for £4O
in the summer of 1946. He
cleared away the trees, made
some of them into planks and
prepared the site. With his life-
savings of £6OO he bought sal-
vaged bricks and other materials.
He then began to build himself
a home. A year laffcr three
rooms were ready, and he, his
wife, their two sons and his in-
valid mother-in-law moved in.
In December, when he had com-
pleted the fourth room, the
local council stepped in.
The number of things that
Mr. Kirby had failed to do is
impressive. Although his bun-
galow was properly built and
satisfied the usual conditions, he
had contravened an Act of Par-
liament and local by-laws—and
he had never obtained a licence.
Moreover, as the land was pro-
tected against building, his bun-
galow didn’t even exist. The
council said that it must come
down, and if he didn’t find alter-
native accommodation by May
1, 1947, they would pull it down
and §ell the materials' to cover
the cost of demolition.
Mr. Kirby did not find an-
other place to live, so the coun-
cil found one for him—a con-
verted Nissen hut. Fortunately
the Kirbys showed a stubborn
resolve to stay, even after the
arrival of the demolition gang,
the police and the clerk of the
council. The demolition gang
pulled down the outbuildings,
but would not set about the de-
struction of the bungalow until
the furniture had been removed.
The men who had been hired to
take away the furniture refused
to do so, and the electricians
wouldn’t cut off the current.
It was deadlock. Meanwhile a
succession of postmen on
bicycles brought letters and
telegrams of encouragement
from all parts of the country.
The Kirby family wouldn’t
budge. Finally, and with
widely-appreciated wisdom, the
Minister for Town and Country
Planning granted a reprieve so
that an “impartial examination”
can be made and Mr. Kirby can
express his views.
Well done, Mr. Kirby!

QUESTIONS
Under present conditions the availability of
modern household equipment is the main
consideration in the buyer’s mind. We are
glad to buy without asking searching questions about what is underneath
the porcelain enamel. But with increasing production and a wider
range of buying choice, purchasers will rightly and wisely become
more inquisitive. “What steeh is underneath?” will be a wise leading
question. The seller who can answer “COMROL Sheet Steel” will clinch
II . his sale . . . and the buyer will have a gilt-edged
assurance of lasting quality: because the name
COMROL is, in itself, a guarantee.

The name “Schnapps” distinguishes a special
type of spirit which is absolutely unique in
character, flavour and aroma.
First introduced to the
English-speaking world more
than 100 years ago, Wolfe’s
Schnapps has earned world-
wide fame both as a refresh-
ing, satisfying drink, and a
reliable, healthful
stimulant. Always

SUNDRY SHOWS
Three Young Painters.
Yvonne du Moulin, Arthur
Nichol and Roy Thibou, under
the disarming title “Three
Young Painters,” have an ex-
hibition at the Macquarie Gal-
leries, Sydney. Yvonne du
Moulin has twisted trees, a green
gully, an innocuous Hyde Park
and others. Her “Furrowed
Road,” a landscape with honest
drawing in it and a germ of
poetry, is cut up and hopelessly
hindered by a formalised pat-
tern. “Max Grazing,” a slight
sketch of a sky, trees and a
horse, is, within its limits, wholly
pleasing.
Roy Thibou has donkeys,
a circus dog, a piano, a caf£,
factories, women and musicians,
none of them with any special
quality of grace or observation.
A meticulous medley of black-
and-white musicians, with a cer-
tain vitality, is, perhaps, the best
of his contributions.
Arthur Nichol’s cubistic
sketches of p.-0.-w. life in Ger-
many indicate that he has
been influenced, as many Aus-
tralian potential artists in
Germany were, less by the sub-
ject-matter under their eyes than
by the translations of these
scenes —clumsy inheritors of a.
crazy European tradition. Some
of the scenes are taken from a
Northern Silesian camp which
was popularly supposed to be
the worst of its kind within the
jurisdiction of the Third Reich,
Be that as it may, it contained
more color and drama than is
indicated by “Potato Cart,
Lamsdorf,” “Russian P.0.W.”
or “Sauerkraut Eaters.”
Nichol’s main talent is illus-
trative, and in these paintings,
by dabbling with strange gods,
he has confused his mission.
“The Conqueror,” however, a
ludicrously faithful sketch of a
German soldier on a bicycle,
completely fulfils its satirical and
illustrative purpose. There are,
however, other indications of a
developing, somewhat muddled
but vigorous talent in “Lyric
Tenor,” “Clown on a Mono-
cycle” and, especially, “Blue
Clown” —a whirling and flash-
ing impression of what appears
to be a devil drumming his
heels.
Painting Small.
Artists who paint small, as do
Percy Lindsay and, at his best,
Dobell, have to paint exception-
ally well. Alfred Cook, whose
exhibition at Sydney Grosvenor
Galleries consists mainly of oil
landscapes about eight inches by
six, paints smudgily.
If it is accepted that the
murky sky represents rain,
“Drenwalla Creek” is an effec-
tive stretch of water and country-
side, and .“Late Afternoon Sun-
light,” if not exactly conveying
the effect of light penetrating a
gully, has at least a local warmth
of color in its rocks and boles
of trees.
But these two paintings are
exceptions. No concentration of
subtlety or force reveals itself
in the other small paintings;
their principal merit is only that
the absence of atmospheric
values does not show as con-
spicuously as it would in larger
landscapes.
It is an odd and disappointing
exhibition from Alfred Cook.
He has customarily been repre-
sented by large watercolor land-
scapes, so detailed as to be
almost photographic, so curi-
ously unreal in tone that they
have seemed to have been
painted through dark sun-glasses,
and yet, for their spaciousness
and technical adroitness, impres-
sive. Only one watercolor in
the present exhibition comes up
to his own standards: “Deep
Creek,” bought by the Victorian
National Gallery, where sheoaks
beside a stream, rather blobby
in the English watercolor style,
make an attractive harmony in
green.
Watercolors by Alice Turn-
bull at Sydney Castlereagh Gal-
leries are colorful, mild and a
trifle saccharine. Straight flower-
pieces such as No. 17, “Bowl of
Stock,” are most pleasing, “Mist
on Brown Mountain” is a relief
from flower-strewn landscapes
and is, in a thin way, pleasant,
and in “Wistaria at Wentworth
House” a hint of opulence in
the wistaria-draped building % is
ruined by two clothed and con-
ventional female figures.
Beethoven and Delius.
The two works presented by
Eugene Goossens, the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra and the
Hurlstone Choral Society in the
third concert of the subscription
series afforded an extreme in
contrasts: Beethoven’s Ninth
(Choral) Symphony and Delius’s
“Sea Drift.”
Apparently sensing that it
would be his final utterance in
the larger forms, Beethoven not
only poured into the Ninth all
the sublimity and invention of
which he was capable, but cut
across most of the symphonic
traditions; and to all the other
instruments he added for the
final movement and for the first
time the human voice, set to
Schiller’s “Ode to Joy.”
Most of the work falls on the
choir, and it constitutes as
severe a test of concerted sing-
ing as could be imagined. It is
especially severe on the sopranos,
who, in one punishing burst,
have to cling to high A for 13
measures. Throughout the
movement the choir maintained
a beautiful balance and built up
good masses of tone. The solo-
ists, Eleanor Houston, soprano,
Evelyn Hall, contralto, John
Dudley, tenor, and John
Cameron, baritone, were gener-
ally very sound, with the
women’s voices having the edge
on the men in carrying-capacity,
though John Dudley rang out
with fine effect in one passage.
Delius’s “Sea Drift” dragged
its slow length along with much
the same painful gait as the
song of which Pope sang. The
music, heavy under the burden
of the hopelessness which marks
so much of Delius’s music, was
never at any stage a match for
the Walt Whitman poem to
which it is set. The choir sang
spiritedly but could make little
headway. The soloist, John
Cameron, pitted his resonant
baritone for the most part in
vain against the submerging in-
fluence of the lower strings.
"Pride and Prejudice."
Sydney Minerva’s production
of “Pride and Prejudice” opens
promisingly in an atmosphere
as feminine as that of a perfume-
shop. As time and bachelors
pass, however, Margaret Raynor,
mother of three marriageable
daughters, develops into a nervy
shrew with little of the maternal
sympathy and humor with which
Mary Boland enlivened the part.
And though the female cast goes
at it hammer and tongues, Car-
mel Sexton and Betty McDowall,
as Jane and Lydia Bennett,
seem unaware that Jane
Austen’s sisters, though not
“over-educated,” were nonethe-
less charming lasses with minds
of their own. The accent is
overmuch on simpering and
giggling, and running short-
stepped across the stage like a
Chinese concubine.
John Sykes enters the scene
with a personality like a dentist’s
drill and maintains it until the
last incredible moments when,
in a lightning reversion of
anathema, Jessica Noad forgives
everything. Unlike Greer Gar-
son’s Elizabeth, there is no por-
trayal of her unwilling but growl-
ing feeling for the haughty Mr.
Darcy, nor, from John Sykes,
Laurence Olivier’s subtle sug-
gestion of a man misunderstood
and calumniated. Both players,
however, when Elizabeth rejected
Darcy’s marriage offer, are in-
tensely living characters. Eliza-
beth standing up to the domi-
neering Lady Catherine de
Bourgh (Hilda Dorrington) is
another flash of excellent act-
ing, but, unfortunately, only a
flash.
John McKiever’s Bennett was
sound ; Desmond Rolfe, shiny in
velveteens and oily in sanctimoni-
ous sycophancy to his patroness,
was perfectly odious, as cousin
Collins was meant to be, and did
the job so excellently that every
time he crawled off to her he
took the best of the play with
him.
"Liliom."
/
The Kuringai Theatre Guild is
to be congratulated on tackling
Molnar’s “Liliom” ; and, in the
circumstances, and with due re-
gard to the difficulties of the
play, on making a good job of it.
Most of the difficulties are
concentrated in the personality
of the central character, Liliom,
the Hungarian tough who was
too proud to work. These diffi-
culties, perhaps, are inherent in
the character. Molnar was only
partially successful in showing
the artist in the hoodlum, and
the fantasy scenes need delicate
handling. Michael Barnes, as
Liliom, lacked toughness and
pugnacity. Diana Lawrie, as
Julie, gave a competent perform-
ance, without poetic fire, and
Beryl Barnes, as Marie, was ex-
cellent. Jim Morel! made a good
job of Wolf, although, in the
later scene, he imperfectly con-
veyed the change in character
brought by prosperity and a
restaurant.
The play, with all minor de-
ficiencies, and with the nagging
deficiency of an occasionally
genteel Liliom, is worth seeing.


Women’s Letters
From Melbourne
Pleasure spread through the State at
the news that Sir Winston and Lady
Dugan have consented to remain in Vic-
toria until the Royal visit is over. The
Governor and his lady have achieved a
popularity which has stemmed from a
natural graciousness and courteous con-
sideration to all whose work brings them
in contact with the vice-regal pair. Lady
Dugan has always made the work of
presswomen visiting Government House
a pleasure. In addition, her untiring
work for the Red Cross, for the Wav
Nurses’ Comforts Fund and the estab-
lishment of the Lady Dugan Hostel for
War Nurses strengthened her hold on the
affections of everybody.
Coloratura Erna Berger enhanced her
daintiness with a full-skirted taffeta gown
of hyacinth-blue for her Saturday night
recital in the Town Hall. The bodice
had an off-the-shoulder line, and large
bows were set near the hem of the skirt.
Among the throng of music-lovers who
thrilled to the soprano’s trills arid runs
were Lady Fraser, smart in black, who
brought daughter Dorothy ; Dr. Edmund
Alcock and his wife, Dr. Doris Officer,
Biddy Allen, Kathleen Syme, Viva Hol-
gate Clarke and Vi Dunn.
Women racegoers at Moonee Valley
mostly huddled into furs and heavy tweed
coats. Mrs. Harold Rabling cut away
from drabness with a sea-green highway-
man’s coat and a small pink toque massed
with flowers. In a full-length mink coat
Lady Mountevans laughed at the keen
wind. Lady Latham’s only spot of color
with her black-tailored suit was the red
which lined the brim of her large black
hat. Wyn Kellow put on a bright tartan
bonnet to set off her navy suit and coat.
Mrs. Ronnie Nott’s almond-green-
speckled wool suit with its swirling
pleated skirt was worn with an upturned
black hat trimmed with green coq
feathers. Mrs, Douglas Falkiner gave
the verdant touch to suitings and small
hat. Mrs. Victor Cornaga’s tailored suit
and small hat were black. Olive Rosen-
thal had brown accessories for her beige
corduroy-velvet jacket suit and hat.
Rainee Le Swift’s wool suit and hat were
electric-blue. Nanette Hughes’s hat was
a riot of pink-and-white-candy-striped
taffetas. Shirley Prince teamed a green
angora suit and pink grosgrain hat. Floy
Bell’s osprey-trimmed black hat topped
a black tailored coat.
Judy Bagnall, who exchanged vows
with Denis Lovibond at All Saint’s, East
St. Kilda, was the fourth generation of
her family to be married at that church:
her mother, her grandmother, Mrs.
O’Hara Wood, and her great-grand-
mother, Lady Holroyd, had knelt there
with their bridegrooms. The bride, who
is the younger daughter of Mrs. W. E. M.
Bagnall, of Upper Hawthorne, and the
late Mr. Bagnall, wore a period gown
of ivory moss crepe fashioned with a
fitted bodice embroidered with clusters
of sequins. The full, flowing skirt
featured a padded hipline. Her tulle veil
was held in place with a coronet of orange
blossoms, and she carried a bouquet of
white carnations and stephanotis. She
was attended by her ’groom’s sister,
Dorothea, and her cousin, Elizabeth
Turnbull; both wore frocks of maize-
toned georgette and carried golden chry-
santhemums and frangipani. The bride-
groom, who is the only son of Mr. and
Mrs. W. G. Lovibond, of Launceston,
had Brian Ranson as best man, and Dick
Thomas was groomsman. Bishop Ashton
officiated. The reception was held at
No. 9 Darling-street.
Millinery designed by young William
Beale was worn by pretty mannequins at
the fashion parade in the Australia’s
Venetian Court, organised by Mrs. Wal-
lace Mitchell and her small committee.
All the proceeds went to the Children’s
Orthopaedic Hospital at Frankston. Presi-
dent of the Children’s Hospital, Lady
Latham, who wore a formal black even-
ing-gown, opened the function. The hats
were gay in color, riotous with fruit,
flowers and feathers and often arresting
in shape. One striking model was a
huntsman’s-green velour, Tyrolean in
design, high in the crown and surmounted
with high curling plumes. Another perky
little creation was of platter shape, and on
each side of the brim sat a rosette of
pink and white candy-stripe taffeta rib-
bon ; a chinstrap of similar ribbon added
to its sauciness. Another hat in coach-
man design was fashioned of royal-blue
velour with mist-blue taffeta ribbon
swathing the high crown and finished with
an upstanding feather. Accompanying
the hats were the Symphony gowns; all
delightful and featuring new and original
touches. Shawl collars were in the pic-
ture ; so were bertha collars, and white
lace was used to make a rounded yoke on
a black frock. The scalloped basque of
Persian-lamb added chic to a simple grey-
tailored suit; beige and black were allied
to make another charming frock.
With Mrs. Wallace Mitchell were Mrs.
S, Aarons and Mrs. Eric Cottrell, mem-
bers of the committee. Mrs. Aarons
covered her aqua-blue satin gown with an
ermine coat; Mrs. Cottrell chose a black
velvet gown and fur wrap. In the audi-
ence were Mrs. Frank Selleck, in a
dinner-gown of black crepe romaine and
silver-fox furs; her daughter Barbara,
her taffetas cut on crinoline lines; her
wrap white ermine; Mrs. Max Mitchell
(the former Joan Hume, just returned
from her honeymoon), her choice aqua-
blue flat crepe and dyed-ermine coat;
Deidre Sandre, her black lace frock hav-
ing a white lace yoke let into the front
of the bodice, a frill of white lace out-
lining the hem of her bouffant skirt; and
Mrs. F. V. Martorama, in black satin
gown and silver-fox cape.
Mrs. Elizabeth Manners, who for the
next three years will train our girls in
beauty culture under the Elizabeth Arden
banner, is a tall, graceful Englishwoman
whose many years spent in America have
in no wise affected her English accent.
She has the Englishwoman’s flair for
quiet but distinguished dressing, but con-
fesses to a love of colorful hats. Photo,

Canon P. W. Robinson blessed the
nuptials at St. Mark’s, Camberwell, of
Norma Lesley, younger daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. N. L. Partington, of Camber-
well, and John William James, elder son
of Mr. and Mrs. W. J. BeU, also of
Camberwell. The bride, who was given
away by her father, wore a lovely ivory-
brocaded satin gown fashioned with a
high neckline, moulded bodice and
padded hipline. The long loose sleeves
of the gown were finished with a soft frill
of ivory marquisette. Her tulle veil was
surmounted with a coronet of tuberoses
and her bouquet was of cream roses and
tuberoses. The bride’s sister Dorothy
was the only attendant; her gown of
ivory marquisette had a heart-shaped
neckline and softly-pleated bodice with
short puff sleeves ; the skirt was long ahd
bouffant. The ’groom’s brothel Bill was
best man.
The reception was held at Queen’s-
road Private Club. Mrs. Partington, who
received the guests with her husband,
wore a dinner-gown of soft-green crepe
and a Kolinsky cape. Mrs. Bell’s crepe
dinner-gown of powder-blue was heavily
encrusted with beads at the hipline. A
beige-fox bolero was added. Among the
many guests were Mrs. Reuben Keam, in
a black velvet ballerina frock and off-
the-face pink hat with a side trimming of
velvet; Rene Hunter in midnight-blue
crepe; Mrs. Jim Rafferty, a long mus-
quash coat worn over her black-crepe
gown; Mrs. G. N. R. Rogers and her
daughter Nina, whose dtisty-pink moire
taffeta full-skirted frock had an off-the-
shoulder neckline; Jean Darragh in an
old-world frock of hyacinth-blue taffeta
with matching roses outlining the hem of
bouffant skirt and shoulder-straps ; Mary
Leonard, whose black-marquisette bal-
lerina frock was worn with a short fur
wrap; and Eileen Kennedy, smart in
black taffetas.
The president and committee of the
Victoria League in Victoria are delighted
with the news that Her Majesty the
Queen has approved that Her Royal
Highness, Princess Margaret, shall become
president of the Victoria League Young
Contingent throughout the Empire. This
is a great honor for the V.L. Young
Contingent, for it was in this State that the
first group was formed in 1930. Miss K.
Hughes is the chairman of the Young
Contingent in Melbourne and Margaret
Montgomery chairman of the Ballarat
Y.C.
From Sydney
June sis a date to be remembered. On
that night the Peter Pan Wool Ball will
frolic around Romano’s. Dinner will be
timed for nine o’clock, so if you’ve been
to the ram sales or sheep show you’ll
have time to get the aroma of your pen-
friends out of your hair." Mrs. Reg Moses
is president of the ball, which will bene-
fit the Peter Pan free kindergarten. Mrs.
Marcel Dekyvere is the active organiser,
and Mrs. Ernest Watt has designed the
invitations. These carry a very grace-
ful sketch of a modern Mary with no
fewer than three lambs gambolling around
her New Look skirts.
A feature of the ball is that the
frocks worn will almost all be of wool.
For the most attractive there are prizes
worth winning. There 'is a dress-
length of finest wool specially chosen by
Norman Hartnell, also a Jacqmar scarf
chosen by Victor Stiebel. These have
been airmailed to Sydney and will be
here in time for the prize-winner to tuck
under the arm after the ball is over. Both
were gifts from the Charles Lloyd Jones
couple, now holidaying in Melbourne.
Last night Sydney audiences had a
chance to become acquainted with the
owner of the voice which has already
won their hearts. The singer was charm-
ing Glenda Raymond. The Vacuum Oil
Company is sponsoring this gifted Vic-
torian girl’s musical education in Italy,
hoping that in addition to doing a service
to musical Australia its example may be
followed by other Australian enterprises,
thus enabling outstanding young artists
to achieve their ambition. Glenda, it
will be remembered, sang the part of
Melba in the radio programme of the
same name. She has won wide
fame in the V.O.C.’s radio pro-
gramme “Opera for the People.” The
young girl (just 22) is a pupil of Pauline
Bindley, and Hector Crawford has been
her musical director. She goes to London
in August and then on to study in Milan.
Conservatorium director Eugene Goos-
sens has been establishing his name as a
host. Last week his dinner-party at
Romano’s' in honor of Baron Von Stut-
tenheim got into the news, and a few
nights before he had given a sizable
after-the-concert party for pianist Eileen
Joyce. This was in the Goossenses’ flat,
but Mrs. Goossens was absent, having
had to fly off a few days earlier for a
short stay in America. There were about
40 guests, all musical.
Last Saturday’s early-winter morning
light faintly raying through the rose win-
dows of St. Mary’s lingered on the filmy
whiteness of Marie Fagan’s wedding-
frock and mists of tulle veil. The frock
was a Ti'tania-like mingling of satin and
lace. The skirt, very full and very long
and spreading into a train, was of Spanish
lace, over satin. Satin was the bodice
with its long sleeves caught at the wrists
in bracelets of sequins and rhinestone
and pearl that shimmered in the dusky
deeps of the cathedral. Marie, slim and
brown-haired, a daughter of the late R.
Fagan and of Mrs. Fagan of Mandurama,
was a very pretty bride, and her ’groom
was noted surgeon John MacMahon.
Monte Luke photograph of the bride was
taken two days before the wedding.
Coming down the long flight of steps
from St. Mary’s after the ceremony, the
newly-wed Mrs. John MacMahon and her
three attendants stepped in warm sun-
light. It gleamed on the bride’s drifts
of tulle and lace and orchids. It glinted
on the gold spots dusted over the full and
swaying white-tulle frocks of her at-
tendants: sister Mrs. Mit Loneragan,
’groom’s sister Dorothy MacMahon, and
Dr. Ina Williams. These frocks had for
added flufliness an apron effect ruffled
at the edges. Their hats were trifles of
stiffened and floating tulle, dusted with
the gold spots. Bride’s mother, Mrs.
Reg Fagan, caught the attention.
Her frock with its hip-length jacket was
of French grey. The wide sleeves of the
jacket ended in deep cuffs of mink. Her
hat, wide-brimmed and soft on the edge
with plumage, was of the same shade as
the suit.
At the following reception at the Aus-
tralia Dr. E. MacMahon, who was his
brother’s best man (Tony Fagan and Dr.
Frank Chutfey were the groomsmen), and
Bill Fagan, who had given his sister away,
were among the speechmakers. So was the
Bishop of Bathurst, who performed the
wedding ceremony. His speech was warm
with old friendship for the bride’s family,
and flashing with compliments for the
’groom. The women guests were all “new
look” in frock and hat, and rich furs —no
coat more desirable than Mrs. John
Woods’s featherweight dyed ermine.
Compliments to%the Harry Moxham lady
for her frock of thick silk in dark sapphire-
blue. It was at once dashing and pictorial
with its double skirt effect. Mrs. Ted
Houghton, sleek in smoke-grey angora,
was noted. ’Groom’s mother, Mrs. T. P.
MacMahon, and his sisters were a good-
looking group. On Saturday the John
MacMahons sail overseas in the Strath-
eden.
Arrived on the Stratheden last Friday
and now settled in at the Australia, Ruth
Berney, small and vivacious examiner for
the British Ballet Organisation. Ruth’s
story of the ballet’s leap into popularity
during war-time is interesting. More
and more parents enrolled their children
as students of the dance. “It just seemed
as though fathers and mothers couldn’t
do enough for their children. They
wanted to give them everything.”
Strangely enough it is throughout the
Midlands that the study of ballet is most
fervid. The British Ballet Organisation
holds examinations three times a year,
and the Midlands entries are always
terrific. Miss Berney, who paints a grimly
vivid picture of the threadbare condi-
tion of the average Briton, is here repre-
senting the great Espinosa, head of the
8.8.0. From Sydney she goes to Maori-
land, and then returns to Australia. In
all she will be here about six months.
One bright figure who will be piissed
on the social and welfare roundabout for
the next six or seven months is Mrs. Roy
Buckland. She goes overseas in the
Stratheden, and will spend much of her
time in Switzerland. The Industrial Blind
Institute is among Mrs. Buckland’s great
interests. She works for it, as president
of the women’s committee, untiringly.
This year she will be away for what is
generally one of the social highlights of
the year and a never-failing money-
spinner for the institute —the White Ball.
This year it will be known as the Black
and White Ball, and Mrs. Marcel Deky-
vere will be the president.
A night of fun during Sheep Show
Week will be the C.W.A, Ball, to be held
on June 2 at the Wentworth. This should
be a prize exhibit among the week’s do-
ings. About 550 dancers are expected,
and 16 white-clad little debs, will flutter
into curtseys before the Governor, Lt,-
General Northcott, and Mrs. Northcoti.
Members of the C.W.A. are sending
flowers from their country gardens to be
made up into posies to be sold on the
great night. State president* Mrs.
will come to town for the ball, and
altogether a very representative /ally is
expected. Mrs. George Mack is the
president of the committee, Mrs. D.
Nolan the secretary. Night’s profits go
to Keera House, at Manly, and Mere-
wether, at Newcastle.
There’s always excitement about a first
night in May Hollinworth’s theatre —or,
rather, the Metropolitan Theatre in
Reiby-place. To begin with, if you have
rather large feet there’s always the hazard
that they may overlap the strip of pave-
ment outside the doorway. Then there’s
the old-fashioned stairway with its mel-
low old handrails to gallop up. Then
comes the place of magic: the theatre.
This is so tiny that you wonder how it
can ever pay (but it does), where the seats
are tiered upwards. The director, May
Hollinworth, publicity woman, Mrs.
Gaul, and first aide, Kath Lloyd, are
generally on the landing outside the
theatre to greet the first-night audience.
The current bill is “Midsummer Night’s
Dream,” and apparently the players
judged the seasons by the English or
Athenian seasons, for the opening night
was pretty close to our midwinter. Still,
there was a lovely crescent moon on high,
and the evening star was Venus. Much
of the charm of this moonbeam-on-cob-
web madness for first-nighters was that
the children of some of the members were
the small fairies. The busy little Pease-
blossom was a small daughter of Leslie
Rees, of the A.B.C. A fashion-note
of what was worn for spectator
sportswear in the good old days in Athens
is supplied by Hippolyta when she comes
in dressed for the hunt —a leopard-skin
slung across her short red tunic, a tall
spear in the hand.
On June 2 in David Jones’s George-
street store, fifth floor, the Public Rela-
tions Section of the Racial Hygiene Asso-
ciation will hold a bridge party to benefit
the association’s funds.

THE SERVICE MAN
Shaping-up in Pales-
tine.
“Ek Dum”: According to the
newspaper reports combatants
in Palestine appear to be so
numerous that they must repre-
sent two layers and so fierce
as to be “irresistible” —both
sides.
The prospect of the two irre-
sistible forces meeting, however,
presents disappointments for
lovers of excitement who are
not prepared to take their
pabulum from reporters.
Having invaded Palestine from
several directions on May 15,
and having already the sym-
pathy and countenance of the
majority of Palestinian inhabi-
tants, the Arabs have been repre-
sented as being involved in a
large-scale war against deter-
mined Jews, resisting bitterly
and defending major objectives.
All that has actually hap-
pened is that various Arab
forces, of varying nationalities,
have invaded Palestine and that
the Jews are withdrawing from
outlying and dangerous positions
which they cannot hope to de-
fend to a concentrated series of
defences on the coastal plain.
There have been four inva-
sions—one in the north from
Syria and Lebanon into Galilee.
This is striking south through
the heart of one of the Jewish
Hits of patchwork State west of
the Sea of Galilee to join with
another thrust from Transjordan
just south of the sea. Both were
aimed at Tiberias.
In the Jericho area, further
south in mid-Palestine, a much
larger force of which the back-
bone was the Arab Legion
crossed the Jordan and then
split up.
In the south coastal area the
Egyptians struck in two direc-
tions. One followed the coast
through Gaza and El Mejdel,
but though it was called from
the first an “invasion” it was an
invasion only of the Arab State.
A second incursion from Egypt
through El Auja along the main
Jerusalem Road towards Beer-
sheba and Hebron, however,
passed through a few miles of
Jewish area, but this part of the
country is only desert and was
unlikely to be defended to any
extent by tfce Jews.
The Jews made two moves,
both inside their own territory
—one from the Jaffa region
along the Jerusalem Road aimed
at Ramleh; another pronged
drive in the north to secure
Haifa and the Lebanese rail-
way, which was put in such
good order during World War
II by Australian engineers.
The central drive of the Arabs
is the main one. It comes
direct from Amman, which lies
about 24 miles from the border,
and 40 miles by crow-fly from
Jerusalem. Amman is the
assembly-point of King Abdul-
lah’s armies as well as his capi-
tal and the base for the best and
shortest route by which main
communications in Palestine
can be attacked after the barrier
of the Dead Sea depression has
been crossed.
Rival Communications
Apart from roads, the Jews
have two main avenues of com-
munication —the sea, if they
have enough shipping to make
it worth while, and an internal
railway which runs through the
more fertile coastal belt from
the southern border to Acre
with a branch from Haifa, south
of the Sea of Galilee across the
border to the Istanbul-Medina
railway opposite the Jebel Druz.
The Arabs enjoy the benefit
of a railway the whole length of
the face of their possible ap-
proaches—a line which in the
north goes through Damascus,
Homs and Aleppo to the Turk-
ish border, and in the south
swings away into Arabia,
The Arabs who crossed the
border in the Jericho region
about 50 miles direct line from
Jaffa, their supposed port on the
sea coast, promptly split into
two main drives. One of these
went south-west, where it again
divided, one force staying to
deal with Jerusalem, the other
pushing into the coastal hill belt
and again dividing. A detach-
ment made towards the coast
direct via Latrun to meet and
join hands with the coastal drive
of the Egyptians; another went
on southwards along the Hebron
road to meet the Egyptians com-
ing up through Asluj and Beer-
sheba.
The force which went north
made up the Jerusalem-Haifa
road, of which it took posses-
sion in the first four days to
within a few miles of the coastal
plain less than 40 miles' from
Haifa, while two offshoots made
for the Lydda aerodrome just
inside the Jewish central area
and Ramleh, just to the south
of it. These were bound for
Jaffa and Tel Aviv.
The general objective of the
drives was to confine the Jews
in a limited lowlying area, in
most of which they could be
dominated from the hill coun-
try of the central portion of the
officially recognised Arab State.
Along this central hill area the
Arabs were consolidating a
strong line for offence at the
week-end.
Outpost Operations
For the first five days nothing
which took place could be said
to be bigger in status than
the cleaning-up of pockets
in main occupied areas. Such
was the occupation of iso-
lated Acre by the Jews on May
18-19, with the alleged capture
of 4000 Arabs. Such also was the
clearing by the Arabs of various
points in the hill area occupied
by small Jewish forces. The
Jews in this layer, between the
coastal plain and the Jordan de-
pression, appeared to have no
objectives save to slow the
Moslem advance and protect
isolated Jewish communities.
Fight in Jerusalem
This was so even in Jerusalem,
where there was no indication
that any very decisive stand
would be made by Jewish forces
who were outflanked there by
the general advances' from the
start. The Arabs claimed on
May 21 to have captured a Jew-
ish message asking permission
to surrender. If, as suggested by
King Abdullah, those parts of
the Holy City which were under
shellfire from Arab lines formed
a “second Stalingrad,” Stalin-
grad must have been a very poor
show.
The Arabs threw a ring
around the Old City, which con-
tained about 1000 Jews. An en-
clave of Arabs was encircled in
the New City in the heart of
about 100,000 Jews. And these
besiegers were in turn sur-
rounded by the Arabs, who
pulled the tiles off roofs in the
outer invested Jewish area with
their shells.
There was little doubt from
the first that Jerusalem must fall.
Indeed it was impossible that
with their limited forces, their
lack of aircraft, the Jews would
waste effort on holding a city
whose civilians it could not feed
and which was within a few
miles of the enemy’s central
aerodrome at Amman. This was
more especially so since the
Jews do not control any main
route to the city, which could be
nothing but a liability.
Jewish resistance, though fierce,
is local. Everything which has a
wall in Jewish-held areas has
been held and used as a fort,
the Great Synagogue and the
Hadassah Hospital and Hebrew
University not excluded. At-
tempts at relief were from the
first purely sporadic—and un-
availing in view of the fact that
Arab numbers are about 10 to 1
those of the fighting Jews.
Into the accounts of what is
taking place all the paraphernalia
of daily-press warfare have been
imported—“fierce artillery fire,”
lady commandos, life and death
struggles and uncompromising
resistances in the midst of which
“Arab families are still going
about their work, despite three
days of particularly vicious
fighting.”
Until the areas of the Jewish
State of Israel on the coastal belt
are attacked in a substantial
way there will be no real test of
strength.
Gyrations in U.N.O.
While the combatants man-
oeuvred for position another
war was being fought—in
U.N.0., on the subject of Pales-
tine and with results just about
as inconclusive.
There were at least two major
Powers in difficult positions. The
first was the United States, which,
faced with a request for recog-
nition of the Jewish State of
Israel, cast a fleeting glance at
the two million Jews of New
York and assented, along with
the U.S.S.R. and the rest of the
Leftist bloc of nations, plus
Guatemala.
The second was Britain, de-
fender of the Moslems. Britain,
when it was never imagined that
such a position as the present
could arise or that a British
Government would quit the
most important defence area
“And the boss said not to forget it's c.o.d.!"
of the British Common-
wealth outside the British Isles,
signed a treaty guaranteeing
Transjordania and obliging it-
self to provide arms and help
should that country become in-
volved in war. As the Trans-
jordania Government has lived
up to its side of the pact, the
Attlee Government has found it-
self in a difficult position, especi-
ally since the Arab Legion is
led by British officers.
Firm action to stop the war,
proposed by United States, was
backed by the U.S.S.R., the
Ukraine, France —which has
no love for the Moslem States
of Syria and Lebanon —and
Colombia; it was rejected
in favor of a feeble order
to the combatants to cease fire at
3 a.m. (Sydney time) on May 25.
The Jews agreed—subject to
Arab co-operation!
The Arabs are firm that they
will fight while the Jews call for
a separate Jewish State. They
call for a united Palestine gov-
erned on democratic lines. This
will not suit the Jews because
Arab voters would outnumber
them two to one.
Meanwhile the U.S.S.R. is
gleefully and publicly attacking
the British in U.N.O. and else-
where for supporting the Arabs,
whom they declare to have been
inspired to aggression from Lon-
don, At the same time, its local
radio within reach of the Arabs
has been attacking the Anglo-
Saxon countries on varying
grounds to both Arabs and Jews
—some base fellow got two sets
of broadcasts to opposite sides
the other evening and spread
them both round together in
several appropriate languages.
Count Bernadette, a relative
of the Swedish Royal family and
president of the Swedish Red
Cross, who has been appointed a
mediator for Palestine, “to
carry out whatever administra-
tive functions the Jews and
Arabs agree to entrust to him,”
at a salary of £BlOO a year, part
of which will come out of the
pockets of Australian taxpayers,
has a hard row in front of him.
One prominent feature of the
situation is that, though the area
concerned is of vital defensive
importance to Australia, that
country’s representatives, who
did so much to bring about the
present deplorable situation,
appear to have forgotten that
Palestine exists.
Drakeford Week.
“Ek Dum”: It has been de-
creed by Mr. Drakeford that
from May 24 to May 30 “Air
Force Week” shall be observed
throughout Australia,
Mr. Drakeford, who uses the
R.A.A.F. communiques regu-
larly as his personal advertising
medium, avers that this is the
week “during which the tens of
thousands of ex-R.A.A.F. per-
sonnel throughout Australia will
be urged to recapture the spirit
of the war-time squadrons,” as
well as “the week in which we
will tell the public as much as
possible about life in the Per-
manent Air Force, the tradition
behind it, the people who run
it, the machines they fly and the
jobs they do.”
The idea of the present Gov-
ernment urging anybody to re-
capture a war-time spirit has
its humors, which are no greater
than some of the points of
history which Mr. Drakeford
relates in his exhortation, such
as:
In 1939 the R.A.A.F. was in the
middle of its developmental scheme.
The old Bristol Bulldogs and Hawker
Demons had gone. The home-grown
Wirraway was in production. Mili-
tary aviation was regarded as vital
to the defence of Australia.
It would be far more to the
point if Mr. Drakeford recap-
tured the war-time spirit suffi-
ciently to give us a real Air
Force. His assurance that the
R.A.A.F. is planning a peace-
time Air Force of 12,000, “four
times greater than pre-war,” is
not reassuring.
Before 1939 Australia had no
machines larger than a couple
of Avro-Ansons. Today it
takes at least six times as many
men to man the same number
of machines as in 1939 and
about six times the training staff
to train them, considerably more
to deal with all the complica-
tions of radar, navigation, de-
tection, protection, landing
arrangements and maintenance.
A better exercise than the
devotion of a week to ballyhoo
and “recapture” of sentiments
which live deep down in the
hearts of every airmen all the
time, and do not need the call
of Mr. Drakeford to revive
them, would be a few minutes’
silent contemplation (accom-
panied by exercises in blushing)
of what the present Government
believes to be a sufficient force
to defend this continent of
3,000,000 square miles and to
provide a roster of trained men
for R.A.A.F. purposes and for
inter-service co-operation:
Home Defence: Four interceptor
squadrons, citizen air force, of which
about 40 per cent, must be of neces-
sity permanent —32 aircraft.
One heavy-bomber general-recon-
naissance squadron, with unit equip-
ment of 8 aircraft.
One target-towing squadron, 8 air-
craft.
This enormous force is to be
“disposed at strategic centres
adjacent to main centres of
population.”
Next come the “Task Force
Elements” nine squadrons,
made up of two long-range
fighter squadrons (32 aircraft),
three heavy-bomber squadrons
(24 aircraft), two transport
squadrons (J 6 aircraft), one
tactical-reconnaissance squadron
(nine aircraft), one survey squad-
ron, with unit equipment (nine
aircraft). Total, 90 aircraft, with
personnel of 2061. The whole
of the “task force” in peace-
time is or will be disposed in
N.S.W. and Queensland.
Thus the total fighting force
personnel for Australian de-
fence is mapped out to be 1182
in home-defence squadrons and
with 40 or 50 aircraft, and 2061
permanents with 90 aircraft.
The remainder of the 12,000
personnel —“four times pre-war”
—of which Mr. Drakeford is
so proud will consist of
H.Q. and miscellaneous .. .. 3403
Training organisation .. .. 3175
Behind these will be a reserve
of men and machines —of the
latter, 439 machines apart from
trainers.
But it should be emphasised
that all of this does not exist at
present. In June, 1947, the
Minister for Defence said:
The re-equipment cycle for aero-
plane and associated equipment will
be: Heavy bombers, five years;
fighters, five years; training and other
types, eight years.
The present equipment and
personnel of the R.A.A.F., as
contemplated by Mr. Drakeford
when his plan is complete (if
ever), will he one front-line
machine (including reconnais-
sance, target-towing and trans-
port) per 30,000 square miles of
territory and one fighting man
per 10,000 square miles of terri-
tory.

Joseph Black published only three papers on
chemical subjects in the course of over fifty years
of scientific research, but his work is of such im-
portance that he is regarded as one of the founders
of modern chemistry. The most important of his
papers, published in 1756 and entitled “Experi-
ments upon Magnesia Alba, Quicklime and some
other Alcaline Substances,” deals with the chemical
changes which occur when quicklime is added to
the “mild alkalis” to render them caustic. He
showed that when a solution of mild alkali is
treated with quicklime, limestone and caustic alkali
are produced. Black’s explanation of this reaction
is still accepted, and so well reasoned is his paper
on the subject that it is regarded as one of the
classics of chemical literature.
Born is 1728 in Bordeaux of Scottish parents tem-
porarily resident in France, Joseph Black went to
Glasgow Univerisity at the age of 18, becoming
Professor of Anatomy and Chemistry in 1756, a
post he retained for ten years until he took up an
appointment at the Univerisity of Edinburgh. But
it is for his work on the alkalis that this Scottish
chemist is remembered. These chemicals which in-
elude such everyday substances As
washing soda and bicarbonate of
soda, are as essential for industry as
for the home. Their manufacture is
one of the most important branches
of the British chemical industry

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
The bunch of really good three-
year-olds contesting the mile Belinda
Handicap lent some class to the
otherwise mediocre programme run at
Moonee Valley on Saturday. The call
was “fours the field,” with Jalna,
Viceroy and Vantage equal favorites,
Beau John next at sevens, and one
or two others supported. The speedy
Beau John hopped straight into the
lead, with Viceroy and Vantage hot
on his heels; in the run down the
straight, however, Vantage, though
conceding 41b. in the weights, wore
down the pacemaker, to win by three-
parts of a length, with Viceroy third.
Jumping events threw little light
on National prospects. Reynard (F.
Dummett), returning from a lengthy
spell of flat racing, enjoyed a solid
advantage in the weights for the
Ardmillan Hurdle, and beat favorite
Repeater by several lengths. The
Lindsay Gordon Steeple saw the 25-
to-1 chance Marsmus (A. Moon),
also very close to the minimum
weight, narrowly beat Krallis, with
Salvo next.
The Foxbridge gelding Ellerslie was
responsible for a remarkable per-
formance in the first Puckle Handicap
for Two-year-olds. Prior to the start
he barged through the tapes, tossed
his rider, and bolted for several
furlongs before being caught and
ridden back to the start. Evi-
dently fresh as a daisy after this
strenuous preliminary, he cleared out
full-tilt again when the starter did
say go, and won by four lengths
from Blue Castle, with Helmuir seven
lengths further back. Ralton (E.
Preston), favorite for the second
division of the Puckle, had his sup-
porters on edge as he just scraped
home from St. Rembrandt and High
Tar.
Britisher had all the appearance
of being a good thing beaten in the
Empire Handicap (13f.), as he rattled
home with a fine burst to be beaten
a half-length by Sir Actor, with
Gayness third. Britisher had started
favorite though ridden by a rather
inexperienced apprentice. The three-
year-old Hua colt Sentiment, raced
in Sydney until just recently, had
slightly the best of a particularly tight
finish in the six-furlongs Coburg
Handicap. A mass of horses hit the
finish almost on terms; the camera
showed San Joaness second and
Daverach third.

Without pretence to do otherwise,
the S.T.C.’s meeting at Rosehill on
Saturday catered for the horde of
generally inferior animals which con-
tested a couple of Maiden Juveniles
and three mixed-stakes events. Punters
fared poorly over these, but had better
luck with the three open-company
events, two of which went to favorites.
Striking the good form of which
he is capable, the three-year-old Hua
colt The Groom (E. Fordyce) ran an
excellent race to down Granite and
Peter Robinson in the seven-furlongs
Flying. In relation to the several
older and more widely-performed
horses engaged, the handicapper had
rated The Groom highly at 8.4.
The 10-furlongs Rosehill Handicap
went to the hottest favorite of the
day, Coalition, starting at 5 to 4 and
finishing on too stoutly for the con-
sistent Parramatoo, who had led the
field into the straight. Coalition is
a son of the dual Derby-winner
Nuffield.
J. Thompson was on Coalition,
completing his almost customary
double; earlier he had won the first
Parramatta Mixed Stakes (7f.) on
De La Salle., downing Snow Star
and Faraway. A three-year-old filly
by Speardale, and well performed at
various country meetings, De La
Salle looked a likely one; so too did
the runner-up, Snow Star, a three-
year-old grey colt by the imported
Rogerstone Castle. He had had only
one previous start in a race, and that
almost 12 months ago.
The other Parramatta Mixed went
to Frescano (A. Podmore) and the
Auburn Mixed (lOf.) to the oft-
photographed Menelik (J. Eaves), on
the 9st. mark; Menelik has figured in
seven photo.-finishes and lost four
of them. The Maiden Two-year-old
events gave jockey E. Doon a double,
Persist (MacArthur-Grail Girl) beat
other fillies, and Foxzami (by Nizami)
tossed the colts and geldings. Both
were fixed-weight affairs, with all
carrying 8.5. In the nine-furlongs
Welter favorite Boomanulla (W.
Cook) pulled a lot of punters out of
the depths when he comfortably de-
feated Euryalus and Skilled.

at Caulfield are
suffering a new form of spots before
the eyes. There are, at present, no
fewer than 11 greys in training at the
Heath. Actually the epidemic isn’t
confined to Caulfield by a long shot —
everywhere throughout the racing
world the greys have been coming
into their own again. In the past
few years they have won three of
the turf’s richest prizes—the English
Derby, the American Santa Anita
Handicap (twice in a row) and the
Melbourne Cup.

Run at Newmarket (Eng.) recently,
and won by My Babu, the 2000
Guineas was well ahead of its name:
34 acceptors at £lOO a nob brought
the total value to £14,412 —the richest
race ever run in England. Fairway’s
Eclipse Stakes in 1928 was worth
£13,306. The 1000 Guineas with
37 acceptors was worth £12,518.

The Australians in England:
With an unbroken run of wins
behind them, the tourists tackled Essex
and Oxford last week and continued
the frightful pasting they’ve been
giving English bowling. Faced with
a mountain of 721 runs, Essex scraped
up molehills of 83 and 187 —a win
for Australia by an innings and 451.
Toshack found his punch, taking 7
for 81, including 5 for 31 in the
first innings. Greater marginal suc-
cesses were seen in 1938, when Oxford
was beaten by an innings and 487;
that smudge, however, was wiped out
in the fifth Test, which England won
by an innings and 597.
Oxford’s team this time represented
most points of the Empire—Australia,
India, S’Africa, Canada and England.
The Australian rep. was “Jika”
Travers, a fair all-rounder, as he also
played against the Wallabies. Minus
most of their bigger batting guns, the
tourists knocked up 431, . chief con-
tributor Bill Brown, recording his
third successive century. Dismissal
of Oxford for 185 and 156 gave Aus-
tralia a win by an innings and 90
runs—the seventh in a row and sixth
by an innings. Toshack kept up the
good work with 6 for 71.
The M.C.C. buttressed its XI with
many possible Test players in the
match at Lord’s on Saturday, but
when Bradman won the toss (the
tourists have had six wins in eight
spins), and the usual batting picnic
put 407 on the board for five wickets,
hopes must have vaporised. Brad-
man failed miserably—a mere 98. At
stumps Miller (114) and Johnson (26)
were going strong.

Playing for Middlesex against
Somerset at Lord’s last week Denis
Compton (252 n. 0.) and Bill Edrich
(168 n. 0.) put up a fresh world
record third-wicket partnership of 424,
so there’s hope yet. Compton belted
three sixers and 37 fours. The pre-
vious record was 389, set by Ponsford
and McCabe on the same ground in
1934.

The Rugby Union carnival at
North Sydney oVal, northern clubs
versus southern, resulted in a crowd-
pleasing game and a 22-11 win for
South. South had the forwards —ably
led by Wallaby Col Windon —they
packed well, pushed hard, and Fur-
ness, hooking against Wallaby Wal
Dawson, gave them the ball. Trevor
Allan captained North, gave a
polished display of defensive play
and scored a try which was particu-
larly brilliant—even for Allan.

Melbourne football form is becom-
ing as hard to follow as racing form.
Geelong, after beating the fast and
aggressive Footscray side, invaded the
Hawthorn country with preliminary
snorts of triumph, was outgeneralled
and outplayed and managed only
12.3 to 17.10. Footscray, the most
up-and-down side in the V.F.L., dis-
posed of Fitzroy by 10.11 to 9.10
and could have made it more. Mean-
time at North Melbourne the locals
registered their first win of the season,
“Go on, Lazy, hop over and fox your own leather /”
12.16-9.10 against poor old St. Kilda.
Richmond easily beat Collingwood,
21.14-9.21; Essendon 19.7 had no
trouble with Carlton 14.9, and Mel-
bourne galloped South Melbourne off
its feet for 15.15 to 9.5.

“J.R.”: That negro pug Leo Pat-
terson, brought out in 1921 to be
slaughtered by Sid Godfrey (B,
5/5/’4B), differed slightly from cur-
rent importations who have been com-
pared with him. He at least had
been something of a good fighter.
Before the First World War Patterson
was rated one of the most promising
young lightweights in America, though
little remained of this promise when
he met Godfrey. Patterson served
with U.S. forces in that war, and,
while in Berlin, underwent an ex-
perience which he ever after blamed
for his loss of form. Billeted in the
imperial palace, Patterson one morn-
ing partook a bath in Kaiser Bills
solid gold tub. After, he always said
“It wus far too rich fo’ dis boy.”

Ernie Jarvis (11.2) was a bit un-
lucky all round in his scrap with
former Royal Marine Joe Upton
(11.2) at Leichhardt. He was un-
deservedly hooted by bleacherites,
who seemed to think he was not
doing his best; actually it was Up-
ton’s mauling tactics that prevented
Jarvis from fighting up to previous
form. Another Joe Grim, Upton
took plenty of punishment getting
to close quarters, where he continually
held with one hand while hitting
with the other. He lost countless
points on that score, and Jarvis con-
tinually gained by doing practically
, all the clean punching seen in the
match; yet Upton got the points
decision.
♦ * * *
At Melbourne Stadium Eddie Miller
challenged by Frankie Flan-
nery (9st.), retained his Australian
featherweight title, though he suffered
severely in the process. If some of
Flannery’s punches had landed about
three feet higher than they did he’d
have won on a k.o. Ref. Jennings
warned him repeatedly without much
effect, and finally disqualified him,
after Miller had been carried to
his corner, suffering the effects of yet
another low ’un, in the tenth round.


ABORIGINALITIES.
“Kelms”: Early in Westralia’s history
a well-meaning pastoralist introduced a
grass which has become linked with poli-
ticians in much the same way as our
eastern brethren couple Hay and hell.
Guildford grass—the pest takes its name
from the district in which it first appeared
—is a‘ wiry fibre with the strength and
nutritional value of a cocky’s fence. For-
tunately it’s unpalatable, and stock avoid
it, but occasionally, by smothering the
useful fodder, it presents some unfortu-
nate animal with a choice between star-
vation and compaction. It converts
sports fields into skating-rinks, becoming
increasingly slippery as it dries, and it
has ruined more lawns than all the milk-
men in the world. But it appears to
have a use. A fibre-manufacturing firm
is extracting its product from the grass,
and they’ll pay for it —£10 a ton. The
idea is feasible. Some years ago a visitor
from Dublin gathered some, took it back
to Ireland, and sent out a sample of
synthetic horsehair indistinguishable
from the genuine article. If the venture
is a success a committee will be formed
to investigate Canberra. Nobody had
previously credited Guildford grass with
any good qualities either.

“Canine”: The mercury was snuggling
down south in its thermometer as our
first fire of the winter licked at the cob-
webs in the chimney. Then our black
spaniel pup entered, nose down like a
vacuum-cleaner; he gave a yelp and be-
gan a beautiful example of one of his
oldest instincts, for as the house runs on
electricity and the hound hadn’t been
around last winter, this was his first
sight of fire. After one startled look at
it he lit out for the corner of the room
to perform there like an eel jellied before
its time. But as the warmth reached him
fie ceased to whimper, and when he
glanced out from under an ear and noted
with relief that the household was still
with him, his “fire-fear” was gone. He
spent the evening gradually edging in,
and when the time came for him to be
taken to his kennel he was uncon-
scious, snoring with a whistling up-beat
and emitting an odor of scorched dog
from one foot in front of the grate. He
refused to wake up, and had to be carted
out to his diggings, gripped in the small
of his back, like a suitcase.
* * * *
“Bosun’s Mate”: An octopus can move
fast (B. 12/5/’4B), and his tentacles
strike like lubricated lightning. Watched
one in a coral pool. Outside a rock cave
lay a small heap of crab-shellsr A quest-
ing crustacean ambled up, and, though a
crab is no tortoise, an arm whipped out
and dragged him in before he knew
what had him. After a hand grenade
afforded closer inspection, we found that
some of the shells had meat left inside.
The octopus injects a digestive juice in
under the crab’s shell, which paralyses
as well as partly digests the flesh. When
almost dissolved it is sucked up. Octo-
puses in turn are the shark’s favorite
dish, though not so easily come by. One
shark we hauled inboard had his skin
circled by patterns of punctured rings
where the teeth of sucker-bearing arms
had squeezed him in their death frenzy.

“Lower Tops’!”: Lakes Entrance, the
holiday resort beside the artificial entrance
to the Gippsland Lakes, has recently be-
come a deep-sea fishing port of conse-
quence due to an influx of New South
Wales trawlers. There the other night
I counted 19 small wooden vessels lying
up. Local gossip has it that trawler
skippers have discovered another Dogger
Ban)c to seaward of the Ninety Mile
Beach which seems likely to be permanent
and which contains whiting, snubnosed
mullet, bream and other choice scale-
fish that are lacking in quantities in Vic-
torian waters. Crews, too, on the lay
system, are reputed to be making pheno-
menal wages. At all events numerous
stout f)oft. diesel-driven hookers.with huge
trawls displayed on decks and with large
“Tell me if I'm hurting.”
quantities of fish arriving at the formerly-
deserted wharves at “The Entrance,” are
an added attraction to tourists even if
the high stench of old fish-scales on
wharf-decking is not.

“Bo”: Late on a calm, still afternoon
ths huge, dead, termite-infested bluegum
the road keeled over, crashing
halfway across the deserted bush road,
leaving barely enough room for a car to
squeeze past. The Shire Council making
one of the quickest decisions in its history,
three weeks later the engineer came out
with two workmen to remove the obstruc-
tion. It being too close to a culvert, the
engineer decided against blasting it into
two sections and set the workmen to it
with axes. Dead wood made it tough
going, and they were just about to have
a spell after about 20 minutes’ slogging
when out from the hollow end near the
butt at the roadside crawled a stubble-
faced figure, his hair all awry, and hold-
ing a blanket and a cornsack. Erect, he
scowled at the axe-wielders, took a screw
up at the sun overhead, and opened his
face in a gigantic yawn ; then he*said :
“Listen! If youse cows suffer from
insomnia remember that other people
don’t—l bin listenin’ to the flamin’
knockin’ for over a minute. Anyway,
there was no need to go diggiri a bloke
out —ain’t y’ got a blasted ferret?”

“B. A. Ker”; I’d repaired the brick-
work inside boilers before; but this
boiler was different from the type I knew.
Fuelled from a patent automatic hopper,
it had no wide furnace doors through
which to crawl —only a short tunnel
which ran at an oblique angle on each
side. It was this brickwork that
had burnt away and had to be
replaced. With a squeeze I wriggled
inside and, working mostly from the
prone position, assisted by a boy who
passed the firebricks in, managed to
finish one side by lunchtime. The spell
restored my kinked back, raw elbows and
frayed patience. About five the job was
completed and I began to wriggle out.
But with the brickwork restored I was
four and a half inches too wide! The
situation looked grim. Then I remem-
bered the emergency cast-iron door at
the back of the combustion chamber.
After a long laborious crawl over the
sooty bridge I reached the spot. The
door was fastened with nuts and bolts on
the outside. Obeying instructions the boy
wrestled with the heat-corroded nuts. He
didn’t succeed, and he Could get no help.
Result: An embittered man had to pull
down his work, crawl outside, get kero-
sene and elbow-grease going on the
nuts, remove the door, crawl inside again,
rebuild the job, wriggle back through the
soot of the combustion then
replace the burred nuts. At ten o’clock
I was- trying to remove the A 1 Jolson
look with soap and water. Collecting
the money next day 1 suggested a slight
rise to partially cover the unforeseen
difficulties. “No fear,” flatly refused the
boss. “Your award only grants you
extra money for two things: excessive
heat, or working in a confined space.”

“Tubbul-road”: I’m only an apprentice
bushman and willing to which is
why Tve a few questions for “Ned” (B.
19/5/’4B) anent that Sandy Jenkins. S.J.
is described as having the best farm and
best stock and his Poland-Chinas took
“all awards,” but he went crook because
the family had no mushrooms to win
him “another ten bob.” Apart from the
fact that S.J.’s Poland-Chinas were prob-
ably the only exhibit in their class—
P.Cs. being rare sights in Australia
what sort of a show was it that gave cash
prizes? And if Sandy was such a good
farmer he’d know that scattering sheep-
dung would be more likely to grow him
a crop of stinging-nettles than anything
else. And with such a good farm and
such good crops and stock, why on earth
would the old skinflint bother with mush-
rooms?
* * * *
“Mat’s Mate”: For the want of some-
thing better to do we’d been listening to a
political meeting in Peterborough (S.A.),
and Mat appeared to be mighty thought-
ful afterwards. “What are y’ thinkin’
about, mate?” I asked. “About them
millions,” he replied. “Y’ know, these
Parliament blokes always do talk about
the millions of quids this’ll cost an’ that’ll
cost an’ how many millions their crowd’ll
spend an’ how many millions the workers
or the cockies or somebody will get out
of it; but I reckon it’s all a flamin’ trick.
How can blokes like you or me think in
millions? Who ever saw a million
quid, or a million sheep, or a
million of anythin’, for that matter?
No, it’s just a trick t’ dazzle a man —
they know damnwell nobody knows what
a million looks like. An’ then you’ll hear
these know-alls talkin’ about the mil-
lions the Government’ll spend an’ they
write in the papers about it. Mil-
lions! What’s a blanky million, any-
way?” He yawned, stretched and looked
at the star-studded sky. “Gripes,” he
said. “Look at that sky. Must be a
million stars shinin’ tonight.” I didn’t
say anything.
* * * *
“Macnell”; One of the main causes of
volcanoes erupting is sea-water reaching
boiling lava in the mountain’s bowels.
This happened when Krakatoa, beside
whose blast New Zealand’s recent
outbreak measured popgun calibre,
erupted in August, 1880. A series of small
eruptions had opened in Krakatoa’s
roots a fissure to the sea. Water under
pressure searched down, squeezing past
every obstruction until it reached the
heated lava mass. Vast volumes of super-
heated steam were generated with ex-
plosive violence. All night the fight went
on, with the sea gradually winning. As
more water penetrated, the lava surface
cooled, forming a repressive cap over
the maelstrom beneath. Then accumu-
lated force would blow it off and the fight
start again. At last another fissure
opened. The influx of tons of water cool-
ing the lava had the effect of fastening the
safety-valve of a boiler, while the fires
below maintained full activity. The erup-
tions ceased. Only an occasional wisp of
steam curled over the crater’s rim. Deep
in Krakatoa’s bowels more water poured
in ; firmer set the retarding cap of solid
lava. And fiercer and fiercer, boiling for
outlet, mounted the fires. Something had
to go. The island shook and heaved.
Then with a blast unparalleled in recorded
history Krakatoa in one tremendous ex-
plosion shattered itself into blown particles
of lava, rock, flame and smoke.

“Lower Tops’!”: Mention of open
season for brush-wallabies on King Island
(B. 14/4/’4B) recalls that these marsupials
played a large part in the settlement of
Flinders Island—King Island’s sister-isle
on the opposite side of Bass Strait.
There in the ’sixties Robert Gardiner,
who leased the 513,000-acre area with
its rugged, quartz-topped ranges rising
2500 ft., employed several men expressly
as hunters. When the island was first
thrown open for closer settlement 60-odd
years ago, the first selectors, the Boyes
family, earned their living principally by
snaring and dogging kangaroos and wal-
labies, which abounded till sheep and
cattle were introduced in force. Twenty-
five years ago the Blythe brothers on the
rich Sister Islands off the north-east corner
of Flinders used to farm black wallabies
and harvest around 1500 skins a year.
Then, too, the pads in the gullies about
Cape Frankland and Mt. Killiecrankie
were lined with springers to intercept the
’hoppers.

“Nakh”: How old is this country?
Conifer-nuts were recently discovered
during excavations at the Yallourn open-
cut below 200 ft. of brown coal deposit.
They were in a perfect state of preserva-
tion and their estimated age is 30,000,000
years.

“G. Mul”; The boss had been wanting
a pig-run built for quite a while, and as a
last resort turned to Blackball, an abo
just a shade lighter than his snooker
namesake. Blackball spent the next three
days clearing ground, splitting rails, sink-
ing posts ; the afternoon of the fourth
day saw the run completed, and the boss
went down for a look. “Heck!” he ex-
claimed. “You’ve built it crooked. Look
at them sides!” “Boss, when you teachum
pig run straight, me buildum straight pig-
run.”

“Greenhide Bob”: On the dinner camp
we asked Monkeystrap how he came to
get the nickname. “Well, it was this
way,” he said. “On Hazard Creek the
year the drought killed the mulga a feller
sells me a nice chestnut sulky horse for
a fiver, an’ warns me he’s never been
rode. Shotgun Mick offers t’ try him
out. The boss warns Mick he ain’t in-
sured, advises me t’ git rid of the moke
before I’m hurt and offers me ten bob
on the bargain. Mick lent me his big
knee-pad saddle, I put a greenhide
monkeystrap on the Ds, We blindfolds
the killer, an’ they hoists me up an’ lets
down the rails. When Mick pulls the
bag off its head I claws the monkeystrap,
takes a deep breath, says a quick prayer,
takes a last look round at the mob, an’
kicks with both heels. The damned
thing walks away, prancin’ like a circus
horse, enjoyin’ the fun. We found out it
had bin a lady schoolteacher’s hack be-
fore Stinger bought it, but he didn’t
know, havin’ picked it up cheap with a
mob of brumbies run in from the Glassy
Mountain.”

“Horseless Horseman”: The most dis-
appointing —and overrated —strip of
coastline around Australia is that 400
miles north inside the Barrier from Cook-
town to Cape York —it differs little in
appearance, from the seaward view, to
southern sandy heathy coasts or the
stunted timber fringing the rocks about
Cape Everard (Vic.). Around Margaret
Bay the marvel to me was that the sandy
soil grew bloodwoods and scrubs and
supported odd ’roos. Most of the islands,
too, if not sandy cays with a few bushes
on them, are fringed with mangroves
and covered with sombre trees to 30ft. in
height. The exceptions to this scenery
are impressive Cape Melville, rising with
its square rocky columns to 1000 ft., the
rugged Flinders Group—-a paradise of
oysters —red-rocky Restoration Island and
Weymouth Bay, where at Portland-roads
a modern wharf serves a goldfield and
aerodrome inland. From Cooktown to
within sight of Cape York we saw one
house only, and, beyond a grove on
Haggerstone Island, rarely a coconut palm
or vegetation such as one sees on Dunk
or Green Islands near Cairns. But in
Albany Pass, near the tip of the continent,
in distinct contrast we saw, for the first
time, rain forests, palms, pearl-white
beaches fronting expanses of smooth
water, and Jardine’s old home, Somerset,
overlooking the lot.
SADDLER TOM.
By a quiet creek, in the years long flown,
In an old slab hut with a roof of bark,
Tom the Saddler lived all alone
And mended harness from dawn to dark.
He waxed his thread and he plied his awl
And he talked of Gilbert and Dunn and Hall.
The trade, he said, he had learned in jail
While doing a sentence of three years' hard.
And that, at least, was a truthful talc,
Though the farmers held him in high regard
And swore wherever he learned it from
There was never a saddler as good as Tom.
Deep down in his stomach he seemed to laugh
When he told the tales of his youthful
crimes—
If only the stories were true by half
He should have been hanged a hundred times!
But I loved the Saddler, boy-like, because
He wasn’t as bad as he said he was.
And on winter nights when the door was shut
And the gusty wind down the chimney blew,
When the curlews wailed round the old slab hut
I could well believe that the yarns were true
As old Tom chuckled and blinked and leered
And the firelight shone on his great grey
beard.
He loved to tell, with a husky laugh,
How he drove to the hills where Ben Hall
lay hid,
His wagon loaded with food and chaff,
And they paid him well for the work he did.
A reckless youth was the Saddler then,
And a trusted friend of the outlawed men.
He watched the fight from his covered cart
At Jugiong where they robbed the mail;
And I sat and listened with beating heart
And tingling pulse as he told the tale
How Gilbert’s bullet pierced Parry’s head
And the sergeant rolled from his saddle dead.
And his voice would sink to a mournful tone
As he told me how, in the darkness dim,
They shot Ben Hall as dead as a stone
Arid, falling, he clung to a leaning limb.
They feared him living, they feared him dead,
And they riddled his lifeless form with lead.
Tom the Saddler —God rest his soul! —
Has long since answered the final call,
But I’d like to think when he reached death’s
goal
He met there Gilbert and Dunn and Hall,
And gained his guerdon, his just reward
As a mighty liar before the Lord.
VICTORIA.
EDWARD HARRINGTON.


“Solitude”: We’d taken a draft in to
the saleyards, and as we reached the
pub verandah the sound of voices trickled
through the bar door. “An’ I must’ve
counted thirty mushrooms,” came old
Buff’s squeak, “in as many yards.”
“Thirty!” The scoffing voice of young
Higgins took over. “You blokes dunno
what mushrooms are. Cripes, there’s
hundreds up our way. An’ big. Why,
one I cooked last night nearly filled the
pan.” Slowly Seventyfiver entered and
lined up. “ ’Day,” Bung greeted him.
“In for the sale?” “Sale?” Seventyfiver
looked surprised. “No —just come in to
get me crowbar done up,” he mentioned,
propping himself carefully against the
bar, and rubbing his back, a painful ex-
pression on his twisted mug. “Been
grubbin’ mushrooms for the last four or
five days.” Young Higgins turned and
eyed him uncertainly. “Didn’t know you
ate ’em,” he remarked, “You must like
’em a lot.” “Like ’em?” The old cove
put his glass down. “ ’Course I don’t
like ’em, but somebody’s got to move the
blasted things out o’ the way so the
cattle can get a bit o’ feed.”

“Conda”; Flying-fish may not fly (B.
12/5/’4B), but what would you call a
leap that cleared the guard-rails of an
Sin. cruiser? May have been the attrac-
tion of undaxkened portholes just after
the war, but we collected enough to feed
the mess. Some sailed fairly through the
scuttles, literally into the frying-pan.
About a foot long, they made good eat-
ing. When flying-fish break surface there
are sure to be bonito or porpoises close
astern, and the scouting sea-hawk wait-
ing above. Have seen hawks power-dive
on a school with an accuracy and speed
that made suicide-bombers look like fall-
ing leaves.

“Gravelsnatcher”: The stranger wanted
to get out to Murphy’s place, about 15
miles north of the town, and back in time
to catch the evening train to the city.
The only available vehicle was an
ancient runabout, and Bill the Goose,
who owned it, was prepared to hire it
out if the stranger could drive it. The
city chap smiled tolerantly and assured
us that he was one of the best drivers in
Perth; but the Goose insisted on a trial
run. They were half-way down a steep
incline and gaining speed at every yard
when the stranger leaned over and
shouted above the roar of the engine,
“Your brakes don’t work.” “That’s not the
brake,” the Goose yelled back. “ There’s
y’r brake,” pointing to two wires running
under the seat. The stranger reached
down and pulled one, and the vehicle
slewed around and almost capsized as the
off-side rear-wheel gripped the road. The
driver wrestled manfully and headed it
downhill again, while the Goose hung
on grimly and cursed. “Damn you,” he
roared. “Pull both o’ them. Y’ got two
back wheels, haven’t y’? Here,” he
reached across. “You pull one an’ I’ll
puli the other. Ready? Now!” But
the driver was getting jumpy and let go
his wire to grasp the wheel. This time
the near-wheel gripped and the car bucked
violently and went into a broadside.
Then the city bloke did things with the
gear-lever that concertinaed the car and
catapulted its occupants. The stranger
hit the road and kept on hitting it almost
to the bottom of the hill. Later, the
Goose brought a mechanic out to check
up. “By cripes, Harry,” he opined des-
pondently, “you wouldn’t think one man
could do so much damage. Not on
his own, would y’?”

“Blime”: Dill was working for old
Bendie when several bullocks took a
fancy to a weed out of season. It was
evening when they discovered the first
casualty; riding round the following
morning they came on another beast
already dead and a third down and help-
less. “Y* better skin ’em,” the boss told
Dill mournfully. “That’n too,” nodding
at number three. “No use waiting. Slit
its throat.” He rode on, leaving Dill to
slap his pockets, curse and turn home-
ward for a skinning-knife. Meeting first
Andy, then Bob, he stopped a while ; then,
as it neared midday, he decided to wait
for dinner before going back. Two hours
later, armed with the knife, he slipped
across to Ted’s hut for a few pointers on
skinning a beast. He found the old hand
working out a card trick. First, the trick
had to be tested, then Ted recalled tat-
tered remnants of others he’d seen, and
by the time Dill remembered the bul-
locks it was getting late. On my way
home I came on him trying frantically
to hold a handful of bullocks in one
corner of the paddock. “Cripes, he’ll
slay me,” he called worriedly. “Told me
t l skin it, an’ the flamin’ thing’s gorn off
somewhere. Anyway, it’ll be in this
bunch. Might be that ’un. Quick, give
us a hand t’ catch it, will y’?”
* * * *
“Ell”: It was during the last few
minutes of morning smoke-oh that
Charlie began to skite about his uncanny
strength. A smallish, nuggety bloke, he
looked useful enough, but not to the
extent of being able to lift three men at
once, as he said he could. Most of us
kept quiet about it, but Jim the rouse-
about was loud in his disbelief. Charlie
offered to give a demonstration, but in-
sisted that the liftees had to be linked
together just so, the weights right, with
a lightish bloke in the middle. On the
woolshed scales Jim proved to be just
right for the middle man, and
after a few trial weighings a couple
of grinning shearers were picked
to make up the team. Under
Charlie’s instruction they squatted
facing on the floor with Jim in the
middle. The howls of mirth as
Jim willingly, though sceptically,
allowed himself to be firmly
gripped by the arms and legs nearly
gave the show away, but he was
too intent on proving Charlie a
liar to notice anything in the wind.
On Charlie’s yell of “Right,” both
shearers leaned back enthusiasti-
cally with Jim spreadeagled help-
lessly between them, and a quick >
grab by Charlie, a pot of Stock-
holm tar and a brush did the rest. It
took me some time to talk Jim out of
borrowing my pearifle that night, and
it’s a wonder to me that the “three-man
lift” hasn’t caused a lot more bloody
affrays. I know how it feels. I was
“lifted” myself—once.

“C.E.”: Hearing that Robbie was going
into town for the day, Mike went over
to get a lift in. Half a mile from their
destination Robbie swung into a side road,
skirted the town by devious bone-shatter-
ing tracks and entered it from the far
end. “What’s the idea?” asked Mike,
“You’re using about a gallon more juice
coming round here? Why not run
straight in?” “Not on yT life,” snorted
Robbie. “Too flamin’ dear. You see,
the garage where I take the bus for re-
pairs is on the other road, and right where
y’ can’t get off anywhere.” He shook
his head helplessly. “It’s got that way
nowadays,” he mourned, “when a bloke
can’t drive his car past the flamin’ joint
or they send him a bill for a tenner!”

“D.R.H.”: The head of a snake is a
good example of Nature’s trick of mak-
ing outmoded structures serve modern
purposes. The teeth are still simple pegs,
not specialised like mammalian teeth for
slicing, chewing and grinding. But they
are bent back to form an efficient
ling mechanism for large wads of tucker.
The hard palate, instead of being absent,
as in the frog, or the complete roof of
“Perhaps he's doing ii for a bet.
bone we possess, is mainly two bars of
bone passing fore, and aft. However,
these bony ridges are also set with re-
curved teeth. As in reptiles generally, the
lower jaw is made up of several bones,
with a distinct “joint” in the middle, and
instead of articulating direttly with the
skull as in higher animals, it does so
through the medium of the quadrate
bone. The lower jaw and the squamosal
bone on the side of the skull proper are
like two sides of a rectangle, one end of
which is the quadrate—a bone that we
have pressed into service as an internal-
ear bone. In snakes the squamosal is
fitted loosely to the skull, and the quad-
rate is long and inclined backward. This
permits the wide range of movement that
allows Blake to swallow comparatively
large animals. In frogs the nostrils open
into the front end of the mouth, as they
did in the fish that were the ancestors
of all vertebrates. In the snake the open-
“This'll take the silly grin off yr face!"
ing is a little further back, but the wind-
pipe still lies along the floor of the mouth
with its glottis well forward. This seems
a better arrangement than the complicated
crossing-over of food and air supplies, the
consequence of the completion of the
hard palate, in the back of our throats,
but it means that Joe can’t breathe when
swallowing bulky objects. However, he
gets over this nicely by sticking the end of
his windpipe out of his mouth, when that
is overful, like a tiny clinical thermo-
meter.

“Jemac”: I know the Council bath
should be emptied by now, but can
anyone explain why my bath-water in-
sists on departing anti-clockwise? And
my creepers seem to go where they want
to, one climbing a Moreton Bay’s trunk
with a right-handed lay, but twisting the
opposite way on a branch. Nature won’t
be tied to set rules—even snails kick
against conformity. Though most shells
have the whorls running right-handed, a
few genuses are spirally opposite. And
I wonder if all flying-fish tails mount a
right-handed screw?
• * * ♦
“Eastern”: Old Empee no longer con-
cerned himself over the home block that
once provided his bread and cheese. See-
ing the legislator’s stock uncared for,
Bob opened a back gate and transferred
a likely-looking bull across into his own
herd. A couple of months later Empee
discovered the loss, and angrily sought
Bob. “Cripes, I’ll pay y’ for him,” Bob
defended. “It wus just that I wus stuck
an’ saw him there, so I —well, I took him
over,” “Took ’im over,” snorted
Empee indignantly, “Stole him, y’
mean. Come an’ helped
y’rself to what didn’t be-
long to y’. Plain daylight
robbery, that’s what, and
I tell y’ it’s one thing this
country won’t stand for.
Awright, y’ll pay the
penalty; that’s our law.”
An hour later, Bob was
still ruminating unhappily
on his gatepost when
Barney pulled up. “Cripes,
I dunno, Barney,” he
worried. “What with
lawyers an’ things it’s goin’
to cost me a good bit t’ git
out of it, I bet. Trouble is,
I’m overdrawn awready.
Think the bank’ll stand us
a bit more?” “Too right,
Monty’ll see y’ through,
Bob,” encouraged the
other. “Just as well it's
happened while he’s still
got his bank, though.
Hear old Empee an’ his crowd’s goin’t’
take ’em over.”
* * * *
“Betcha”: When a rabbit gets picked
up in a mob of jumbucks he squats in
the swarm of moving legs and hopes for
the best. When a grown hare finds him-
self thus enclosed he dashes around
wherever there’s an opening, or stands
on his hind-legs seeking a way out. But
a fox is nothing but a nuisance. Was
drowsing along peacefully, the dogs
steadying the lead and turning in the
flank occasionally, when a hunting dog
that mostly follows harmlessly chased
down a fox from the hill on the left.
Johnny was making heavy going, and,
as no other shelter offered, he deliberately
took refuge among the sheep. The
jummies scattered, the hunter kept on
after his fox, and the sheepdogs grew so
interested I was hard put to it keeping
them on the job of holding the mob to-
gether. Time after time the ginger bloke
dodged round where the sheep were
thickest, while the one-track-minded
hunter followed noisily, the sheepdogs
yapped excitedly from the outskirts, sheep
stamped or broke, and I bellowed hoarse
orders and violent threats. Upon cap-
ture, the fox p'roved to be old and mangy,
accounting for his poor speed and the
added need for strategy.
* * * #
“Zake”: The crowd were on the bank
watching debris and timber carried by
the swollen river dash against the bridge
supports and wondering if the structure
could much longer withstand the shocks.
As they tossed opinions a mud-spattered
horseman galloped up, and they
recognised him as Joe Kentwell,
from out along the road to The
Mole. Joe hurled himself off the
prad and dashed up to the watchers.
“It’s Ben Noonan!” he gasped. “He
was down rescuin’ his horses from
the floodwaters and was swept
away. His nephew Denny couldn’t
get to him—last he saw of Ben was
him clinging to an old pianner-case
an’ goin’ for the main arm o’ the
river. I thought if we got some
poles and held ’em out on each bank
he could grab ’em as he come past
—we better get a trot on or he’ll be
here before” “Just a mo,, Joe,”
drawled the voice of Charlie Man-
ning. “How long ago did Denny tell y’ he
saw him bein’ swept away?” “About half
an hour ago. I galloped all the way
an’” “Half an hourl” went on
Charlie, “But Ben’s joint’s about seven
miles up the river. It’s runnin’ at around
eight knots, so that’d give him nearly an
hour to get here. What’s the hurry?”

“Gloucester”: He came to help me
in the orchard. Work began at 7.30 a.m.
He arrived at 7.25, walked to the seat
of labor and shed his huge overcoat to
reveal an alarm-clock hung around his
neck by a pair of bootlaces. This he
carefully set upon a handy post. And
to it he worked well, but punctually, all
day. The knock-off whistle was a peal
from the alarm.
* * * *
“Old-timer”: It’s a fairly common be-
lief that the first stage of insanity
appears when a man begins talking to
himself, but circumstances alter cases, and
you are invited to consider the lone
bushman. Working on some far outback
plain where he mightn’t see another
human being for a month, or tramping
lonely tracks, he frequently defends him-
self against the mental if not the physical
isolation by speaking his thoughts aloud.
The words may be addressed to his horse
or his dog—and it is true that there are
horses and dogs that can, to some extent,
take part in the discussion —but for all
practical purposes the chap is talking to
himself. I believe that this habit, for a
habit it becomes, keeps a lonely man
sane, and it is certain that outbackers
take little or no notice of the man who
talks to himself but are wary about the
silent cove. I’ve heard men talking to
themselves in city streets, and at first
glance they appear to be slightly touched,
but I reserve judgment ever since, en-
countering an old cove in Melbourne’s
Swanston-street talking loudly to himself
what time the passing crowd eyed him
suspiciously, 1 said, “Keep quiet, old
’un, or you’ll have a John grabbin’ you.”
“There’s no law,” said he, “against a man
talkin’.” He paused and swept the crowd
with a disdainful glance. “Anyhow,” he
added, “whoinell could a man talk t’
in that lot?” Then we discovered a
mutual knowledge of western Riverina
and adjourned to the Royal Mail.

of buttered scones for the morning spell
—and Choom earbashing. “In Owd

cocks?” growled the boss. “Haycocks

Choom. “And,” he went on, “us alius

Choom. The boss took a last gulp of tea
and climbed back on the binder. “Pity

were in the Old Dart,” he snorted. Once
around, and the boss pulled the horses to
a sudden standstill. “An’ wot’s

Choom hollered. The boss whirled his
long whip. “Giddap,” he yelled.
BATTLE MEMORY.
Wings of the valkyrie
Seem to beat breathlessly.
Prisoned and wild in me.
Hastening my heart.
Faster their wing-beat sounds,
Racing the whistling rounds
As the artillery pounds
The red world apart.
The wings and the hooves I hear
May be blood sped by fear,
Yet as comes thundering near,
Nearer the fray,
Some presence waits, I swear,
As real yet vague as air,
Lest there be need to bear
My soul away.

The British Labour Minister, in intro-

Act,” stated that “The 1946 Act”:—
“Acknowledges the inherently in-
ternational and comprehensive char-
acter of insurance."
The Labour President of the Board of
Trade in the House of Commons also
stated that it would be proper to inform
the House of the attitude of the Labour
Government toward the future of British
Insurance business. The Government, he
stated, had no intention of interfering
with the transaction of Insurance business
by private enterprise. It is, he stated,
the desire of the Government that Insur-
ance should be, in the future, as in the
past, dealt with on an international basis
and as business of an international
character.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WOR RY. I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZCOS."
Pressing Hints.
“R.A.A. Sergeant”: When
putting a bale in the press make
sure that the running side (the
seamless run of the bale) is oppo-
site the door. This makes for a
square bale and easier pressing.
When pressing daggy locks
tramp the bottom box butdeave
the top box firm though un-
tramped. Always press the bale
well down ; a dab of paint placed
on the cable in the right place
is a handy indicator. Use only
two skewers on each side, and
keep them sharp and bright for
easy use.
Put the next bale-cap on the
monkey while it is still on top
of the bale—it saves a lot of
lifting.
Fasten the short sides first.
Two fasteners, each about six
to eight inches from the edge of
the flap, are sufficient. Next se-
cure the running-side flaps with
three fasteners, placing the centre
one first. If the bale is pressed
far enough the flaps will meet
and overlap without straining.
When fastening always have the
points of the bale-hook point-
ing away from you ; a slip means
a badly-gashed face at the very
least. Brand on the running side
and you will have a neat, square
bale that is easily handled.
Yarding Sheep.
“K.W.R.”; Don’t bring them
straight up to the gateway, but
to one side of it, then use dogs
or riders to ring the edge of the
flock towards it. Usually they’ll
go through at the first attempt,
and the flock is then worked to
keep up the flow through the
gate. Where possible sheep
should be brought up on the lee
side of the gate; they work
better against the wind, and
dust will be blown away, allow-
ing them to see.
With weaners or young sheep
it’s always a big help to include
a few grown wethers or ewes.
They’ll lead young sheep to
water and make easier handling
at gates and yards. Don’t discard
the old sheepman’s trick of
strewing greenstuff around and
through gate openings before
the flock is brought up. It’ll
save men, dogs, sheep and time.
f
Grazing Management.
“Prof.”: One of the benefits
gained from grazing stock in ro-
tation is that the extra subdi-
visions ensure an even distribu-
tion of the stock over the food
supply. However, the stock
would benefit just as well if they
were divided over the area and
allowed to graze each division
continuously. The essential of
successful pasture management
is to graze evenly. This can be
accomplished by dividing the,
various plant associations when
subdividing a property.
Thus in this S.A. district the
higher ground dominated by
spear and wallaby grasses must
be separated from the barley-
grass on the flats or the latter
would become overstocked and
the native grasses on the rises
largely neglected. The greater
the subdivision the more even
will be the grazing, but usually
divisions sufficient to divide the
various classes of stock would be
satisfactory. The rate of stock-
ing must be kept at a sensible
level, and it is possible that cer-
tain types of pasture —for in-
stance, pure stands or mixtures
containing lucerne —cannot be
grazed continuously without
damaging certain of the con-
stituent plants.
Who Will Work the Land?
“Archaps”: Though the
Queensland Government owns
most of the land in the State, it
is acquiring freehold properties
for its great food-production
scheme. Some people fear that
it is headed for land nationalisa-
tion. On the other hand, the
Minister for Agriculture (Mr,
Collins) stated at Monto that
the Government did not believe
it could do a better job than
individuals in the production of
food, but it would carry the risk
and, if successful, hand over the
business' to private enterprise.
At a meeting in Toowoomba
Dr. A. A. Heath (Yandilla)
sought an assurance from the
Government that, in the event of
overproduction by the corpora-
tion, Australian farmers would
be protected against under-sel-
ling by the corporation. W. A.
Raff (Karara) pointed out that
there was the danger of under-
production in the event of a
drought, and the use of all avail-
able grain to keep alive the pigs
owned by the corporation. After
what has happened and is hap-
pening in the Federal sphere,
graziers cannot be blamed for
interpreting the enthusiasm
shown for the scheme by State
Labor politicians and bureau-
crats as an indication that
socialisation of land production
is the ultimate aim. The public
is at least entitled to demand
that accurate records be kept of
clearing and production costs
generally, also of the prices re-
ceived for the finished article,
whether pork or bacon, cost of
transport, etc.
We have had considerable ex-
perience of State “white ele-
phants” in Queensland, and any
future attempts to prove pri-
vate enterprise wrong should be
conducted in such a manner that
any budding “white elephant”
can be “slaughtered” before it
has absorbed too much of the
taxpayers’ money. Of course
there is a possibility that the
scheme will prove private enter-
prise wrong, but not many
people in Queensland, even in-
side the Government service,
would be prepared to bet on
that.
Dehorning Calves.
“Wilco”: It is easy to nip
horns in the bud if the caustic-
potash stick is applied when the
calf is from two to five days old
—it should not be more than
nine days old. Use a caustic
stick that has not deteriorated
through contact with the air. It
will keep good in a well-stop-
pered glass-jar, protected from
dampness.
Get someone to hold the calf
while you work. Clip the hair
from around the horn-buds and
surround with vaseline. Wrap
brown paper around the end of
the caustic stick to protect your
fingers, moisten the stick and
rub the centre of each horn for
about 30 seconds. Rub again
for a few seconds after five
minutes or so. After two or
three treatments blood will ap-
pear at the horn-tip, which in-
dicates that the horn is defi-
nitely “stopped.”
It is essential to keep the
the caustic stick away from
parts other than the horn-tips.
Keep the calf in a dry shed for
a few days lest rain or dew wash
the caustic down its face, thus
causing serious bums.
Cane Pests.
‘Sarina”; Convolvulus vines
are worse than ever in Mackay
(N.Q.) canefields this year. Until
the last couple of years only the
tiny white-flowered bindweed
was plentiful, but the blue morn-
ing glory has now spread in
from the scrubs. The vines
thrive during the summer months
and die back during the cool
weather, but even when dead
the stringy things are remark-
ably tough and make cane-cut-
ting a slow and difficult task.
Less plentiful, but still a serious
pest on some farms', is the Star
of Bethlehem creeper. The
giant mimosa, or sensitive plant,
is a thorny curse in many
northern fields. All these weeds
require scientific investigation
with a view to their control,
since ordinary cultivation of
plant and ratoon-cane is ineffec-
tual against them.
The Blackberry.
“Once Cocky”: Recently a
mate and I put in a few days
cutting blackberry for a time-
harrassed dairyfarmer. The
land, gently-sloping terrace, had
been cleared, but not sufficiently
for the mower, and sown with
sub.-clover, . The ’berry clumps
were up to 10 feet high and
pretty nearly touching on most
of the stretch we carved out.
The clover had seeded in heaps
among the ’berries, drying-off
early as it does on this class of
land, and would have come
away well after autumn rains but
for the mass of vines that had
covered it in a season or two.
It cost about £2 an acre to
clear that land, and as far as the
owner is concerned the money
may as well have gone down the
drain. Another farmer might
have dragged those vines away
to a barren, stony patch and
cremated ’em among some vigor-
ous growths of their kind. Then
he could have raked up the
clover seed, spread it and fol-
lowed up with disc-plough or
rotary-hoe, A fierce bum will
roast the valuable seed. Clear-
ing the stumps, stones and sticks
after cultivation would leave the
way open for mowing. Costs
may have been doubled, but
“ Aren't you going to peck me good-night?”
there’d be a future in good graz-
ing or meadow-hay on that
patch of land.
Cracked Hoof.
“E.H.S.”: Remove the siioe
and ascertain carefully the ex-
tent of the injury. If the crack
is superficial fill it with a com-
position made of 4oz. of bees-
wax, 2oz. of yellow resin, loz.
of turpentine and ioz, of tallow
and keep the foot cool and
moist. If it extends to the sensi-
tive parts and fungoid flesh is
visible pare away the edges of
the cracked horn that press upon
it and apply caustic to the
spongy growth. Saturate a wad
of cotton waste in Stockholm
tar and bind it firmly in place.
The foot should be kept in a
bran poultice for a few days or
until the lameness is relieved, A
shoe may then be put on so as
not to press on the sore part.
The tarred waste should then be
removed, the crack filled with
the composition and the horse
turned out on fairly soft ground.
Water for Fowls.
“J.J.A.”: Carrying water ana
repeatedly filling up water-
troughs a number of times a day
is tedious and unnecessary, tak-
ing up valuable time that could
more profitably be spent doing
some other job. Fowls can be
easily watered by installing a
ball-tap and putting in a water
system of troughs of the same
level fed by the same pipes.
The best pipes are and
the troughs can be made either
of sheet metal or concrete. The
trough should be raised above
the floor to prevent the litter
being scratched into it, and sur-
rounded by a wire guard to pre-
vent fowls from getting more
than their heads in. The troughs
are better outside the pen.
The trough itself should be
at least 6in. deep and three or
four inches wide with a plug at
the bottom for cleaning. The
pipe should project up almost
to the surface of the water to
prevent rubbish entering it.
Clean once a week. This will
save hours of drudgery every
week, and the fowls always have
cool water, especially if the
trough is covered.
Fruit-tree Seedlings.
“E. 2”; Strong and symmetri-
cal root-growth is essential to
the best trees, and the seedlings

IT is not left to our engineers to guess whether our
engines are giving their full horse-power. They
adopt a very enquiring attitude when it comes to
the rated horse-power qf Ronaildson-Tippett En-
gines. Each and every engine (not just one in a
batch) goes on a testing stand, where it must
prove its ability to carry its rated horse-power on
the specified fuel consumption.
This assurance that EVERY engine is fully pow-
ered is but one of the reasons why owners of
Ronaldson-Tippett Engines never cease to ‘tell
the world’ of their satisfaction. It is an important
factor in the Australia-wide use of Ronaldson-
Tippett Engines over the last half century.

even, spreading growth. Re-
planted in the nursery, they may
be trimmed again when planting-
out to permanent positions.
Keep the nursery beds well
watered in the growing season.
Few seedling fruit-trees bear
fruit of quality good enough to
warrant growing, so they should
be grafted or budded with suit-
able varieties. Grafting is done
on apples, quinces® and pears
when growth starts in the spring ;
budding stone-fruits is, done in
early autumn. Both processes
are fairly simple, being the close
union of the cambium, or inner
layer of bark of scion, with stock
and sealing against air. Two or
more varieties may be grafted on
one stock, a means of providing
a selection of fruit where orchard
space is severely limited.
Thorough soil preparation
should be made when planting-
out fruit-trees. Dig the topsoil
out and stack to the side and
work the subsoil deeply with a
crowbar. Place the tree upright
and spread the roots evenly, tak-
ing care not to bunch or cramp
the roots through lack of space.
Shovel the topsoil in and press
down firmly, and don’t let the
trees lack for water or become
waterlogged.
Hints for the Farm.
“Mr.”: Pigs under four
months old need milk more than
older pigs, and some preferential
treatment will be called for as
the supply of skim-milk falls.
Fed with grain and other foods',
half a gallon of milk to each pig
is ample. If there isn’t enough
to go round pigs on a grain diet
will require a substitute, and
this is best supplied by meat-
meal. A ilb. per day will re-
place igal. of milk and balance
all the grain a pig will eat from
weaner to baconer size.
“Myrr”: Winter sprays of
tar distillate stop the greenpeach
aphis but not the black variety.
which lives on the roots and
ascends the trunk in late winter
to attack the new growth. To
block the blacks wrap a sticky
barrier round the trunk; four
parts of castor-oil and nine
parts of resin heated to melting
point (but not boiled) and
spread on thick brown-paper
makes an ideal trap. The same
recipe will do for fly-paper. In-
sects that get past the mess can
be dealt with by spraying loz.
of nicotine sulphate in 4gal. of
water, plus 2oz. of soft soap or
a half-pint of white-oil emul-
sion.
“Calos”; To get rid of white-
ants place pieces of meat near
their nests. Meat-ants will come
for the meat and will attack the
termites and clean out the
colony.
“Ben Acre”: For an emerg-
ency funnel select a bottle that
has a slight ridge round the bot-
tom. Slide a file or square-
edged piece of metal down the
bottle so as to strike„against the
ridge. A few sharp taps will
bring the bottom off neatly.
“C.A.A.”: Tests in Western
Wimmera have demonstrated
that addition of zinc sulphate to
super, is an economic means of
increasing wheat yields on fal-
lowed land not previously treated
with the mineral. Zinc costs
about 2d. per pound, and as the
requisite dressing (51b. to 101 b.
per acre) is comparatively cheap
only a small increase in the
wheat yield is required to war-
rant its use. Where using the
mineral with super, mix when
dry and keep in that condition.
Leave some strips sown without
zinc so that comparisons can be
made.
“Mark”: The Green Glaze
cauliflower has advantages
others lack. Insects will not
attack the dark, glossy leaves,
and the heads do not suffer as
much setback from a short
dry spell as do other caulies.
“W. Court”: Water in a
freshly-cemented tank is unfit
for drinking or for washing
clothes since the water is too
hard with chemicals to form a
lather with soap. Let the tank
fill and run over, or, better still,
fill it yourself and then empty it
after a few days. The next issue
may be drinkable or it may be
necessary to repeat the process.
“Ben Acre”: For cutting
leather a pair of good secateurs
is hard to beat.
“Sarina”: For warts on cattle
Queensland Department of Agri-
culture recommends sump oil
rubbed on freely with a stiff
brush two or three times a week.
The treatment softens the
growths and they are gradually
rubbed away. Castor oil is a
better cure but is more expen-
sive.
“Billjim”: Tests at Parafield
by S.A. Department of Agricul-
ture have shown the best type of
poultry for export to be Rhode
Island Reds and Sussex, crossed
both ways. It was also proved
that export table birds can be
raised under ordinary farm con-
ditions, rearing costs are not ex-
cessive, and if well-grown birds
are promptly marketed at six
months of age profitable returns
result.

A “Half-cold” War.
There had been a terrific day-
long struggle for the key point
in the city’s defences, Mosche
Blumengold’s Moneylending Co.
Fighting had flared up early
that morning. Backsheesh
Pasha, the Gyppo C.-in-C, had
cunningly disguised himself as
an Israel commander and tried
to “Moscow” his field-glasses.
Moshe had offered him the
equivalent of 15 piastres on
them. In a towering rage at this
insult —for the British colonel
from whom he’d pinched the
glasses had paid 200 piastres for
them —Backsheesh P. withdrew
to his headquarters and ordered
a platoon of his crack snipers to
knock down the trinity of gilt
balls.
After the snipers had fired a
mere 80 rounds per man one of
the signs of Mosche’s ancient
calling was smashed by a bullet
ricocheting off a wall. Mosche
demanded that the C.-in-C.
Haganah forces should combirie
with Irgun Zvai Leumi and the
Stern Gang in an all-out attack
on the Gyppos. The Irgun and
“ W ant another slice o' toast , 'Erb?
Stern commanders went into
conference with C.-in-C. Hag-
anah, and the trio exhibited
great enthusiasm at Mosche’s
announcement that the Gyppo
troops were investing the city —
until it dawned on them that
they weren’t investing in it.
The Gyppos had brought up a
mortar battery and trained it on
the Blumengold Moneylending
Co.’s shop. They were hoping
that a stray British soldier might
come along and show them
which way the shells were
dropped into the barrels when
a corporal from Odessa rushed
out of a building and chalked on
the wall a rough picture of a
Zionist poking his tongue opt
at a, copy of the Koran. This
brought a hail of fire from the
Gyppos, and one bullet almost
hit the building.
An hour, later, while each side
was having its morning coffee
and looking at a can-can dance,
a swarthy visitor came shuffling
into Israel High Command
headquarters. He was wearing
a fez and a snappy line in striped
tents. Name? Manny Konk-
stein. This threw the High
Commanders into confusion as
to which side he was on. While
they were trying to determine
it the visitor, after leaving a
suitcase which he said was a gift
from Joe Stalinstein, quietly de-
parted. Hearing no ticking com-
ing from the case the Zionists
opened it, to behold a magnifi-
cent array of pork chops.
In the black passion that this
aroused the C.-in-C. ordered the
Zionist forces to charge the
Gyppo army. Immediately there
arose fierce arguments among
his subordinates as to how much
they should charge, and the
order lapsed in the ensuing re-
criminations.
When at last the attack was
launched the Jewish casualties
were heavy. Eighteen were
carried to casualty clearing
stations, having been laid low by
spits in the eye. Two had had
the tassels of their smoking-caps
hacked off, one had been shot
in the neck of his water-bottle,
three had had chewing-gum
worked into their beards and
several might have been blown
to pieces if the Gyppo soldier
who had thrown the grenade in
their midst had been told that
the thing had a pin in it. That
night students in Cairo up-ended
and burnt 14 trams and beat 10
policemen to death in the joy-
ous celebrations which greeted
the news that in this great Islamic
victory 30,000 Jews had been
killed.
Throughout the afternoon, ex-
cept for the 45 minutes off for
black coffee and camel by-pro-
duct cigarettes, the battle
swayed to and fro, and fre-
quently fro and to. At one
stage, during a terrific hand-to-
hand struggle, Backsheesh
Pasha was captured by a Zionist
pay-clerk. B.£. having no sword,
military conventions were in
danger of being shattered when
the captor held his hand out and
said “Fez, please.” The C.-in-C.
absentmindedly dug out a piastre
from his pocket, held it out and
said “One section.” Gratified
at the sight of money, the pay-
clerk grabbed the coin and
fled. After that the fighting
reached a crescendo of fury;
braces were savagely ripped off
some, and others received severe
face-slappings.
As the day’s savage encounter
drew to a close a swarthy-visaged
figure in a long overcoat with a
bowler-hat pulled down over his
ears stole into Backsheesh
Pasha’s headquarters. As he en-
tered the C.-in-C.’s room he
shuffled forward and slipped a
roll of notes into the Gyppo
chiefs hand,
“Vould you mind pumpin’ a
few incendiary shells into that
building across the vay?” and
Mosche —for it was he—pointed
to the M.B. Clothing Manufac-
turing Co.’s premises down the
street. “The stock’s insured up
to the hilt, but it ain’t there —I
shifted it all today. Yhen can
you start?”
Bo.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first Is paid

North Coast Power-supply
A decision on electricity-supply by the
Tweed Shire Council strengthens the case
for a new State in northern N.S.W. The
whole of this N.S.W. border area, the
Tweed valley, is, with one exception,
supplied with electricity from Brisbane,
about 80 miles away. The exception is
Murwillumbah, the chief centre of the
district; which supplies itself from its
own power-house. The council’s deci-
sion is that the local unit be sold to the
Brisbane concern, which would then take
over the whole area. In this event the
Murwillumbah station would probably
be closed down.
Supporters of the council’s move
maintain that continually increasing run-
ning costs will force up local rates, as
they already have, and make the town’s
electricity too dear to be a sound eco-
nomic proposition. It is considered that
the large-scale Brisbane concern, cover-
ing much of south-eastern Queensland,
is big enough to overcome the problem.
The main argument against the change
is that the Tweed will become entirely
dependent on a long-distance supply, by
no means free of breakdowns —one, in
the last few days, lasted over seven hours,
a serious matter if the local hospital had
been on the Brisbane supply. From a
military viewpoint also the proposal is
unsound, as it accentuates a centralised
system based on an almost defenceless
coastal city open to air-sea attack.
On the other hand, the Murwillumbah
unit is in no position, financially, to ex-
pand sufficiently to be able to run itself
economically in the future. High run-
ning costs —wages, coal, cartage, etc. —
are seeing to that. It seems that the day
of the small isolated power unit, here as
elsewhere, is over, and the council has
taken the easy way out.
To obtain both objects—cheap elec-
tricity and local control —the best method
seems to be a modified “grid” system,
rather on the English model —a “linking”
of power units so that in the event of a
breakdown of any one of them there is no
failure of supply. Already, in this area,
the “linked” Clarence hydo-electric
station and Lismore power-house pro-
vide a good foundation, with which the
Tweed could be connected.
Eventually the whole North Coast and
Tablelands, possessing abundant water-
supply, ample resources; and a well-dis-
tributed population, could be covered by
a “grid” of linked hydro-electric stations
and fuel-burning power-houses. Such a
system, placed under a regional authority,
would provide cheap electricity, be free
of long breakdowns and would be almost
invulnerable to enemy action.
It seems useless, however, to expect a
regional electricity scheme while we are
without a regional Government.—K. A. S.
(N.S.W.).
A Lesson from Japan
Australians who joined 8.C.0.F. in
Japan have had a great chance to see
something of how an older civilisation
lives. More intimate fraternisation has
been discouraged, but we have had oppor-
tunity of visiting leave-hostels as far
distant as Nikko in the north of Hondo
and Beppo, popular tourist resort on
Kyushu Island. There are other leave
centres at Kyoto, old capital of Japan,
and at Kobe. Those interested have
studied something of the religion, history,
art and culture of the people.
The fact that has impressed me most
is the remarkable industrial growth of
Japan. When their fleets met in the
Russo-Japanese war early this century,
victory for the Japanese fleet was im-
perative, for the Japs did not then possess
a steelworks or shipyards worth the
name to carry out any major repair job.
There was practically no textile industry
at start of the century, yet by the ’thirties
Japan had just about run Lancashire out
of business in the East. Great chemical
and shipbuilding industries and shipping
lines were built up.
Japanese industry has had the advan-
tage of ample cheap hydro-electric power,
cheap labor, economic transport by sea
and the inland seas and waterways of
Japan, On the other hand there were
serious handicaps in the poor quality of
the iron ore available —about 35 per
cent, metallic content —and the coal,
though plentiful, is unsuitable for coking.
That has been a great hindrance to the
steel industry. The factor which helped
Japanese industrial growth was the very
definite policy of co-operation by the
Government.
The Government facilitated, fostered
and protected every new industry. Japan-
ese shipping lines had to break into world
trade and compete with old-established
shipping companies. The Government
subsidised and stood behind them.
Japanese industry was founded on private
enterprise, and the, spirit to venture in
industry received encouragement and
practical protection* from the State until
established. It is the opposite to much
that we see in Australia. — Alpha
(8.C.0.F., Japan).
Social Service
Every taxpayer is forced to contribute
to our social-service scheme, so why must
a form, suspiciously like a means test,
be completed when applying for tempor-
ary sick-pay allowance? The form,
foolscap size, is not confined to the fair
questions, such as nature of illness, usual
occupation and period required for re-
covery, but contains on both sides of the
sheet questions demanding one’s financial
position. Details of bank balance, bonds
held, investments or property, if any,
must be fully supplied and the form
signed before a J.P.
As every social-service contributor’s
financial state is already known at the
“Very Well , Fifi, no walkie-walkie till you eat
your caviare
Taxation Department, why should a
duplicate be required to provide yet
another Government department with oc-
cupation and gossip? In small centres
where everyone knows everyone else’s
business this further intrusion on personal
privacy is deplorable.
Another unfair point about the scheme
is that payments are not retrospective.
If you are too ill to apply for your sick
pay for a time (and some really sick
people are unable to grapple with forms
at the beginning of a serious illness) you
must go without pay until you are well
enough to prove your worthiness for
social service.—P. R. (Vic.).
“Doctor-boys”
Medical assistants are doing a fine job
in the Islands. Hospitals I saw in Bou-
gainville were clean, airy and flanked by
color-filled gardens. Opposite numbers
to our bush nurses, the assistants run a
hospital with 250 patients, handling all
but the most serious operative cases..
These are sent to doctors at Kieta or
Sohana. The assistants gain no kudos
from a difficult cure, nor favorable men-
tions by superintendents, yet plug along
training “doctor-boys,” dressing and
diagnosing and supervising their hospitals.
Their reward is the self-satisfaction of
a job competently done.
The main native sickness is ulcers, or
yaws. A foul, rotting disease, to which
white men are largely immune, it attacks
through cuts or bruises, producing a
running sore. After a few months sores
erupt all over the body. If not treated
the disease eats away the flesh. I saw
one Mary with only half a foot.
The trained native doctor-boys go out
into the hilltop villages, treat minor cases
and bring bad ones back to base, if
necessary carrying them. These boys
take immense pride in the cleanliness of
their wards. They judge themselves, and
are judged by the villagers, by the simple
precept that if a patient fails to recover
the doctor-boy is for ever shamed.
To a male nurse with initiative and
sense of responsibility the Island hospitals
offer splendid scope for both. — Conda

Buying a House
“Carlyle” on the evasion of pegged
prices (B. 31/3/’4B) reminded me that I
tried to buy a house. The actual value
was about £BOO pre-war, the local
council’s official valuation £950, and the
vendor’s price £l5OO.
An official of a local-government de-
partment not unconnected with housing
valuations told me how some vendors get
by the law which forbids selling or buy-
ing of houses at higher than the official
valuation. You take along your £l5OO,
, sign the contract of sale at the £950
council valuation and, in a room without
witnesses, pay over the difference between
the legal and the blackmarket prices
(£550), plus an extra £5O.
You get a receipt for £5O deposit, but
nothing to show for the £550. When the
permit to sell comes through from the
control department you weigh in with
the balance. Thus you are both covered.
If the permit stipulates a lower price you
still chip in with the balance of the price
on the contract and the receipt is altered
to suit.
They’re doing it every day, although
the vendor in my case is still looking
for a buyer.—23ls (N.S.W.).
The N.T.
My one-time employer, Lord Vestey,
does know the meat business and when
he states, as he did recently, that the
N.T. will never be worth a
damn until it is linked with
the eastern States by means
of an efficient rail system,
then I for one won’t argue
with him. In that respect
he’s in agreement with the
Payne Report, which “Ek
Dum”(B. 18/2/’4B) dismisses
as a scheme to spend several
millions on railways in order
to raise the population to a
problematical 45,000.
That would be only a fair
Randwick crowd; but it
would mean something in the
Territory, and, in any case, it
isn’t the human so much *hs
the aniriial population which
counts. If you could raise
stock figures or other pro-
duction in the same ratio
you’d achieve tremendous de-
velopment.
As various alternatives to
railways in the N.T. have
failed to give results in any
way commensurate with their
cost, it’s high time we
stopped playing with the
problem and took it seriously.
After all, even if you do dis-
like the use of railways for
development on aesthetic or
any other grounds, you can
at least say of the principle what The
Bulletin says, with overwhelming sim-
plicity and directness, in defence of capi-
talism, “It works.” Transporticus
(Singapore).
Theory and Practice
The present Federal Government con-
sists in the main of men with little ex-
perience of business and the actual run-
ning of affairs. Their numbers are largely
recruited from union ranks and certain
professional and semi-professional classes
—sections with little knowledge of the
likely repercussions of some of their pet
legislative moves.
The P.M, and other Ministers have
gathered around them a kind of “brains
trust” to advise on all such matters as
Ranking, foreign policy, rural production
and anything else that can be mentioned.
With this crowd in the background, the
imponderable factor of human nature
and other elements are lost sight of or
not understood.
Take the question of banking. In theory
it may sound good policy to have one
bank manager in each town, one office
and one staff. In practice it will build
up a hidebound control where decisions
will be given in the manner of the State
Lands Department, months after the
applications have been lodged. The
whole idea of friendly, interested and
helpful service will quickly disappear
under the deadening hand of officialdom.
Production of wheat is another ex-
ample. That was curtailed because, in
theory, harvests might be too great. Re-
sult, N. S. Wales was forced to import
wheat from other States and the world
is crying out for our grain. In practical
production wheat-planting should never
be retarded in this land, for nature is ever
at work curtailing harvests with droughts,
floods, pests, etc.
Prices of second-hand motor-cars are
fixed, but in practice about 90 per cent,
are being sold at blackmarket prices.
Theoretical price indices inform the house-
wife that there has'' been a certain increase
in cost of living, but she knows that it is
much more. She also knows that weight
is not often there, quality is not up to
standard, and tins and boxes are smaller.
—C.B.M. (N.S.W.). ,
Wonder Drugs and Workers
Scientists are reported to be perturbed
at evidence of the waning influence of
penicillin and the sulpha compounds.
If they are right, the Darwinian laws of
natural selection and survival of the fittest
operate in the world of the microscope as
elsewhere, and breeds of germs and bacilli
are being evolved capable of withstand-
ing the wonder drugs. They tell the same
story of D.D.T., hailed a year or two
ago as a sure-fire eradicator of all fly-
borne diseases. American scientists say
it requires a double quantity of the
chemical to do the work it would do in
1944, as flies are developing increasing
resistance through the survival of the
more robust members of each generation.
There should be a lesson from this
for those who have been prescribing
socialist panaceas for all the ills of the
world. The nostrum was that in a
planned economy the baser instincts of
man would be tamed and led along loftier
paths; full employment would ensure
that everybody would be happy and price
controls would see that no one would be
robbed. It didn’t work out that way in
Germany; it hasn’t done so in Russia;
it is not doing so in Britain or in Aus-
tralia.
In Britain a time of full employment
coincides with poor production—except
in industries not yet “nationalised” —and
with the lowest ration scale in the
history of the country. A similar
boasted state exists here side by side with
unprecedented shortages in consumer
goods. In both countries gambling is
rife as never before, and the blackmarket,
which in theory should be no more,
flourishes with blatant arrogance.
Just as D.D.T'. kills off the weaker flies
and leaves the stronger to multiply, the
puny efforts to stamp out blackmarketeers
are effective only against the smaller and
more timid of the pests, and indeed seem
to encourage the development of a hardier
and tougher type of racketeer, cheekier
and more conscienceless parasites. To
complete the analogy, the bureaucrats
who, under socialism, are the sulpha
drugs, the penicillin and the D.D.T. that
are supposed to cure all the ills of the
body politic, grow more and more numer-
ous every day.—J. B. (Q.),
Root of the Matter
The current price of Malayan tin (£504
sterling a ton) has Australian tinminers
hopping-mad. The price here is £4 12s.
a unit, or £344 10s. per ton 75 per cent. •
tin ore. When the difference in exchange
rates is added it’s plain that tinminers in
this country, are getting only half the
price paid for all imported tin. Hundreds
of tons more could be produced at the
Malayan price.— Midnight (N.S.W.).
The closing of a large South Mel-
bourne foundry after 75 years’ operation
is further illustration of the fallacy that
limited production will make jobs spin
out and eventually lead to the “Golden
Age.” The foundry, the only one in
Victoria making large cast-iron pipes for
water and gas, had plenty of orders on
hand, but found that pig-iron, coke and
labor supplies were insufficient for eco-
nomical operation. The recent iron-
workers’ strike, led by Thornton’s Vic-
torian commissar, Flanagan, aggravated
the difficulties. C. N. McKay, president
of the Chamber of Manufacturers,
described the closing of the foundry as
proof that the man who slacked to make
a job last eventually put others as well as
himself out of work. — Dutigalla (Vic.).
The weakness of the Chifley Govern-
ment in allowing wharflaborers to deter-
mine the policy of this country regarding
the N.E.I. has had its repercussions in
Holland. In a recent letter to a friend
in Melbourne an Australian girl visiting
relations writes:
I was surprised at the ■ feeling against
Australia here in Holland. Though every-
one has been very kind, wonderfully so
in fact, they do resent the part played by
Australia in the affairs of the Netherlands
Indies.
—A.M. (Vic.).
Why so much enthusiasm for the sub-
sidising of State orchestras? Not one
citizen in a hundred can really appreci-
ate the highbrow works performed by
the expensive ensembles. The aim of too
many “great” conductors seems to be to
provide music so difficult to execute and
understand that only expert players and
press critics can understand what all the
sound and fury signifies.— Gumleaf
