Grey Hair is always taken to be a sign
of age or worry, and in a woman, especi-
ally if she be in early years, amounts to
a tragedy. A woman should never let
herself go. The signs of youth should
always be protected. The well-known
preparation, Dr. Alien’s Mexican alnut
Stain, removes all trace of grey. It is

HIS BOOKS
Links
Oqe writer I have been reading this week
speaks of books as books should be spoken
of. “The tiny books,” he says, “are un-
tamable little devils.” It postulates that
they live. I know one bookshop where they
do not. Its atmosphere is heavy and dark
and dingy. Every book in it seems to have
been varnished, and so embalmed, en-
tombed. There is something dead about
the look of them all. They are not opu-
lently dead, as the recent Birkenhead’s
books must have been, all in their uniform
bindings; first editions and other such
specious treasures ruined to the eye and
market alike by their fine leather coffins.
Max Beerbohm had a better feeling for a
book when he insisted on each volume in
Heinemann’s collected edition of him being
in a different colored cloth. Perhaps that is
cutting it too fine; for the creations of one
pen, and especially of any such individualis-
tic pen as Beerbohm’s, are, after all, of a
family. But Beer-bohm is fastidious, the
last of the exquisites, and would have each
book joined to its brothers and sisters by
no other family link than that it is a book.
Maurice Hewlett expressed something
similar when he complained that the public
declined to admire him when he tried to
give a different kind of book every time he
wrote one. He should rather have taken
that as an expression of the public’s accept-
ance of a book as a living, not a dead, thing;
more, a human, not a merely animal, thing.
For surely there is a direct analogy be-
tween that and the public’s acceptance of
any old colored kittens a suburban cat
may take home and its pious indignation
or malicious laughter at the appearance
of a doubtfully genuine small fellow in a
home of virtuous suburbia.
II
One evidence of this living nature of
books that has struck me lately is the way
three or four of half a dozen seemingly
unrelated books that your nose may select
for a week’s reading will often be linked
together by some thread of topic or theme.
I started this week off by reading Nathan
F. Spielvogel’s Old Eko’s Notebook
(Angus and Robertson; 3s. 6d.), and, as I
find often happens, its theme persisted
almost throughout the rest. The theme is
school, though the schools are certainly
different enough. Mr. Spielvogel’s is the
Australian bush school; and no one who has
read any of the previous work of this most
human, friendly, sympathetic writer will
need to be assured that it is the genuine
article. Old Eko is the schoolmaster wise—
not merely clever. One of his guiding prin-
ciples is that more is done by laughter than
the experts wot of. His plea is for his
brothers to be educators rather than
teachers.
Let the pupil come first in importance, and the
lesson take second place.
Therein lies the difference between the trades-
man and the artist.
Again:—
No boy was ever made good by whacking.
A boy can be quietened. A boy can be cowed.
But if that means making him a good boy, then
the best boys are to be found in the cemetery.
Dead boys are quiet enough.
To stress this philosophical side any more
might be to create a wrong impression of
the book, which is not concerned with edu-
cation abstracts, but with life as it is lived
in the places where the Old Ekos do their
work. It is a collection of mostly narrative
sketches, with howlers and suchlike school
titbits tossed in to add a few more to its
already plentiful grins. Human is the word
for it.
III
The writer who spoke of books as “un-
tamable little devils” is Azorin, whose
An Hour of Spain has been capitally trans-
lated by Alice "Raleigh (Routledge; Dy-
mocks; net). His slender book is an
academic speech! Probably it sounds like
a contradiction in terms to say that it
seems also to be literature. “Is not this”
asks Salvador de Madariaga in his introduc-
tion, “the first time in the history of letters
when an academic speech is found worthy
of translating?” Azorin (a pen-name)
taking his place in the Real Academia
Espanola, has “to outline the biography,
analyse the work and sing the praises of his
predecessor —a politician and a man of the
world.” He himself, on the other hand, is
literary, artistic to his shoelaces. Yet he
gets away with having you think none the
less of his predecessor. He performs this
miracle by surprising that gentleman in a
worldly present-day salon, bowing gallantly
and taking between
his hands the hands
of a pretty lady.
In a moment you
are back in Spain
of the sixteenth
century, with its
grand background fixed in a series of
beautifully etched vignettes. Thus—having
already sufficiently outlined the other
aspects of his predecessor—Azorin sings his
praises by simply singing the praise of Spain.
It is contagious. Those who believe in that
decadence which he vigorously denies might
gain a new belief from this Hour.
IV
It is a very different school—the school
militant—which links up in Chiron, or The
Education of the Citizen of the World, by
M. Chaning Pearce, just added to Kegan
Paul’s “To-day and To-morrow” series
of speculative booklets, which sell here at
3s. 6d. The author, in his own school in
Switzerland, is trying out some of the prin-
ciples of modem education advanced in
Chiron. He believes the English Public
School system is out of date. It was all
right, indeed essential, in a world that de-
manded a continuous supply of men capable
of governing on the narrow lines of adminis-
tration that built and held England’s
dominion before the war. But to-day “Eng-
land is full of men chiselled by the Public
Schools into a governing type who have
nothing to govern.” The insularity which
was the virtue of the Public School type is
now his vice. His is a splendid type, as
was that of the Spartan youth, and it is as
little adapted to modern life—how little
is being revealed in the relinquishment of
the old domineering rule in India, Egypt and
elsewhere and the replacing of it by a rule
of co-operative assistance, to which the
Public School product cannot adapt himself.
The writer’s solution is a “federated system
of schools in the leading countries of the
civilised world, working upon a common
educational policy, with a free interchange
of staff and pupils and an intimate inter-
relation.” The necessity for this is one
with the holding of peace. If the world
wants peace, it must educate for peace; for
(he quotes from Madariaga)
The world is not going to conquer peace and
then sleep on its laurels and roses; for the in-
stincts of war ate ever alive, and so the instincts
of peace must be ever on the watch.
To sum up briefly, he demands a change
in our Public School system, so that it will
discontinue to turn out a perfect product
for the purposes of yesterday and try to
turn out one perfect for the requirements of
to-day and to-morrow.
V
The same link also binds up the curiously
conceived and curiously titled His Monkey
Wife, or Married to a Chimp, by John
Collier (Davies; Roycroft; 7s. 6d.). Its
hero (?) is a schoolteacher of the African
wilds. On a bald statement of the plot—a
lady chimp secretly learning to read, falling
in love with her master, the unsuspecting
teacher, accompanying him to England, and
there taking the veil from his prospective
bride and being married to him—the novel
would seem certain to fall into repulsiveness
or absurdity, or both together. But the
whole thing is too-grotesque, the treatment
too whimsically satirical, for repulsiveness
to enter into it, and even the actual wedding
somehow misses absurdity, though perhaps
not by much. It is an extraordinary blend-
ing of the real and the nonsensical. Emily,
the chimp, thinks largely in quotation from
her favorite authors. “Something better
than his dog, a little dearer than his horse,”
she thinks bitterly when Mr. Fatigay shows
no signs of returning her love; and when, in
the little school, she takes up pencil and
paper and is about to write, she shrinks fear-
fully from his merely amused “Come, come,
Emily! If you are as clever as all that,
you must be sold to perform on the halls.”
At once the frightened chimp had relinquished the
implements of clerkiness, and crept trembling to her
old place of subjection. How it all recurred to her
wheii later on she read that Mrs. Virginia Woolf
had been denied admittance to a University library !
The writer makes convincing reality the
vehicle of his satire. His book rings almost
as true as “Gulliver’s Travels,” without,
however, resembling that book of imperish-
able quality in any other respect.

White Island last year, is an adventure-
tragedy comparable with Scott’s.
Neither of the principal contributors,
Andree in his diaries and Strinberg in notes
and in shorthand letters to his sweetheart,
has any of Scott’s gift of literary expres-
sion; and there is no one here to serve
them in the English in which Charles Tur-
ley paid tribute to Scott. Scott wrote of
Oates:—
He has borne intense suffering for weeks without
complaint, and to the very last was able and willing
to discuss outside subjects; He did not —would
not—give up hope till the very end. He was a
brave soul. This was the end. He slept through
the night before last, .-hoping not to wake; but
he woke in the morning—yesterday. It was blow'ing
a blizzard. He said, “I am, just going outside and
may be some time.” He went out into the blizzard
and we have not seen him since....
We knew that poor Oates was walking to his
death, but though we tried to dissuade him, we
knew it was the act of a brave man and an English
gentleman. We all hope to meet the end with a
similar spirit, and assuredly the end is not far.
But though there is nothing of that almost
biblical quality here, there is terrible expres-
siveness in the simplicity of some entries
made in these diaries when the circum-
stances were especially pressing;' and though
one may quarrel with the presentation, par-
ticularly on account of the reams of purely
technical matter by various expert hands
sandwiched in among the. vital leaves, it is
sufficiently sincere and serious to convey
some personal sense of the tragedy.
The balloon, the Eagle, rose from Dane’s
Island on July 11, 1897. The flight ended
on an ice floe on July 14. For the last
day or so the balloon bumped along
over the ice with a motion that made
one of the occupants “seasick.” They
made camp, and stayed there on the float-
ing ice for a week. On July 22 they began
a journey across the loose ice, making for
land. They shot Polar bears and lived
mostly on their flesh, cooked in various
ways on a primus. By August 19, though
their spirits were still high, the struggle
was beginning to tell. On the 20th there is
the entry: “We have done a good day’s
work, probably three miles.” Next day, on
Andree’s proposal, they agree to try what
raw meat is like. The verdict: “Raw
bear, with salt, tastes like oysters, and we
hardly wanted to fry it. Raw brain, too, is
very good, and the bear’s meat was easily
eaten raw.” Also on Andree’s proposal, they
try blood—blood pancakes, a great success!
On August 31: “The sun touched the hori-
zon at midnight. The landscape on fire.
The snow a sea of fire.”
The going becomes worse. The polar
summer is ended. You can feel the strain
even in Andree’s flippant entry of September
4: “On such a journey as this • there is
developed a sense both of the great and of
the little. The great nature, and- the little
food.” Oh the 9th the entries cease. There
is silence until the 17th. Meanwhile illness
has attacked the three of them. Fraenkel
has suffered most. He is not able to pull
his sledge, but can only push it, and the
others have to go on ahead and come back
for him. On the 17th Andree begins:
“Since I wrote last in my diary, much has
changed in truth.” First they had made
for Franz Joseph Land. Then they had
made for the Seven Islands. But now the
drift has beaten them. They are worn
out and ill. They are caught on the pack-
ice at the beginning of the Polar winter.
Yet on September 18, the 25th anniversary
of thoir King’s ascension to the throne,
Strinberg enters in his log-book:
BANQUET, 18 SEPT., ’97,
on an ice floe immediately east of (White Island).
Seal steak and ivory gull fried in butter
and seal blubber, seal liver—brain and kidney.
Butter and Schumacher-bread.
WINE.
Chocolate with Mellin’s Food-flour and Albert
biscuits and butter.
Raspberry syrup sauce.
Port wine 1834 Antonio de Ferrara, given by the
King.
Speech by Andree for the King with royal Hurrah!
National Anthein in unison.
Biscuits, butter, cheese.
A glass of wine.
FESTIVE FEELING.
During the day the Union-flag floated above the
camp.
On October 1 they are still on the floe off
White Island. “The evening was as divinely
beautiful as one could wish.” But at 5.30
in the morning there is a thunderous crash;
a torrent of water pours in on them; their
“beautiful floe” is splintered into a number
of little floes. One fissure is just outside
the wall of the ice hut. They are “frivolous
enough to lie in the hut the following night,
too.” But their “home” is in fragments; their
belongings scattered. Andree concludes the
main diary: “No one had lost courage;
with such comrades one should be able to
manage under, I may say, any circum-
stances.”
Only portions of the lines of the second
diary have been deciphered. It is not
known how they died, though two of them
seem to have died in their sleep. They
were taken home in pomp and circumstance
last year. There was a memorial celebra-
tion in the Blue Hall of Stockholm’s City
Hall. The coffins remained in the church
a few days more. Then they were taken
to the crematorium, and given to the fire.

a sheaf of wireless talks on bird doings and

for a broadcasting management sufficiently

.net) is ■?,the ..last novel William J. Locke
wrote before his lamented death last year.
Brotherton Drake is the lamb. He is a
spendthrift but a good sort, and his twin and
double in appearance. Sir Atherton Drake,
Bart., falls dead while the two are alone
together. He’assumes the deceased’s clothes
and _ identity only to find that the sancti-
monious Atherton was about to figure as a
co-re. and was being blackmailed for his
crimes. The bitter-sweet ending is charac-
teristically Loekeish in its unexpectedness
and in its rather sugary sentimentalism.
Way for a Sailer! by Albert Richard
Wetjen (Chapman and Hall; 7s. 6d. net),
contains Jack Lassan’s impressions of the
sea from his early days in the fo’c’s’le to
the proud moment when he can see three
gold bands’and marriage ahead. Unabashed
frankness is Mr. Wetjen’s line. At one
stage he is assistant saloon deck man on a
fashionable' lirier :—1
It was a point of honor that anything any passenger
left lying round after dark should disappear. We
stole everything quite shamelessly. I had quite a
collection of vanity dases, cameras, books and
handkerchiefs. , -V
After - some strictures on ship-board morals
(“Every officer usually spots ,liis girl first
day tout” 1 ) he> turns; to cargo-broaching :
They [the broachers] either work quietly down
in the shelter deck or else go down through the
forepeak and get to the hold through the
bulkhead door. Then with flashlights they examine
the cargo, quietly break open certain cases, take out
what they want and fix the case again. As long as
the cases look untouched and, are not left broken
up, the ship’s officers , don’t seem to care much.
He remarks blandly elsewhere: “Another
great source of regular contributions to the
fo’c’s’le funds came from the passengers’
baggage.” Contact with the women of the
first saloon disgusted him j with the crude
ways and voices of the women of his class,
and inspired him to become an officer. It
isn’t a pleasant work, but the writer can
certainly write. Some of his little pictures—
of a typhoon lin Torres Strait, of a tramp
steamer lazing up the west coast of Africa,
of a wet night in the East End of Loudon—
are, masterly in their slap-dash, colloquial
way.
India—the Truth, by J. E. Woolacott
(Philip Allan; 2s.'), is a necessary antidote
to the uninterrupted flow of pro-Indian
literature. The /‘Times” correspondent tells
.of what.the maligned raj has done to squelch
(the-' appalling native moneylender by means
of co-operative societies, of which there are
now 110,000; to develop agriculture by sub-
stituting modern machinery for the 'sharp-
ened piece of wood with which the villager
scratches his futile little holding; to lift
the untouchable off liis supplicatory stomach ;
to educate the masses and to rescue the
Indian worker from his sweating Indian
employer. Opposition to these measures has
come from Indians of all classes. Of 16,000
tenements provided at an uneconomic rent
by the Bombay Government for factory
workers, 11,000 remained untenanted, the
oppressed Indian preferring squalor and
overcrowding to modern sanitation. Since
the Government completed irrigation works,
railways at a cost of £600,000,000 and ro-ads,
no famine has occurred comparable to that
of 1630, when it was unsafe to go out after
dark for fear of being killed and eaten.
The United States of the World, by Oscar
Newfang (Putnam; price not stated). The
author points out that America’s 48 States
fight their battles before a Supreme Court
with brains instead of bullets, and with one
exception peace has been preserved among
them for almost a century and a half. He
compares the machinery which has achieved
this result with the structure and functions
of the League of Nations. An obvious
trouble is that the American States, though
they may be, as he says, “as jealous of their
rights and prerogatives, as keenly insistent
upon their interests, their prosperity and
their prestige as are any of the States of
Europe,” are bound together with a common
nationalism. The compared States are not.
The United States are a plain domestic
family, with common family ties. The Euro-
pean States are a number of families, with
nothing vital in common. But however moth-
eaten this writer’s postulate may be, his
comparative review is interestingly done,
and his conclusion practical: “What the
American people consider necessary for an
effective association of nations for world
peace is the establishment of a body to lay
down international law, a body to apply the
law and a body to enforce the law.”
And a Little Verse
SCARAMOUCH.
A bachelor, through every shire,
Upon a bouncing horse' I ride,
From boots to brain, a boy on fire;
The glory of the countryside.
Where’er I light me down, I kiss
The first man’s wife I chance to see;
And if that wife’s man takes amiss,
My knuckles pay his face the fee.
Good wine’s a most delicious lap;
And, with the rest, I drink on shares,
Glass against glass ; but, by no hap,
Put out one dpit. Such honor’s theirs!
So with my dinner, too: since why
Should I, for natural relief,
Give aught save “Thank you, sir,” when my
Unbaited stomach roars for beef?
Now that I’m young, my heart’s inclined
Towards the things that tempt to mirth—
Bottles and girls of every kind,
Flags and fiddles and good, green earth.

WHATINF LATIONISANDISNT
Inflation and deflation stand in need of
a clear definition. We are using words
to mean too many things and not always
the same things. Lately by inflation we
have generally meant an expansion of the
currency—beyond some point or other left
undefined. But inflation can be accom-
plished without touching the currency; in-
deed, currency inflation is, as a rule, the
last refuge of financial incompetence.
Inflation is the creation of-cash or credit
at a rate which outstrips production. The
banker meets it in individual cases when
there is nothing in the shape. of general or
national inflation. He sees businesses which
have been laying stone upon stone, faith-
fully and laboriously, demoralised by the
sudden access of new capital beyond im-
mediate needs. He sees men who have
been paying their way turned suddenly into
other courses by winning a prize or coming
into a bit of money. The seeds of inflation
are sown as soon as a payment of any sort
is made. Whether there is inflation depends
on the use that is made of the money.
There has been inflation in Australia for
many years, and few of us have recognised
it. During the seven years 1923-29 we bor-
rowed from abroad 174 millions. It was
not inevitable that this should produce in-
flation; had we made good use of every
penny, and increased the production of
things as fast as we increased our means of
buying them, there would have been no
inflation. But we were only interested in
spending: we made oxly the smallest pre-
tence that the works would be profitable.
The result was that we had inflation on a
vast scale—an inflation for which every
political party in Australia was responsible.
And it was all the more dangerous be-
cause its effects were cloaked for so long:
notwithstanding the continued inflation, the
£ Australian could be changed 'for the £
English. What was happening was that the
poison in our system was being kept under
control by continuous loans; our £ was
worth a sovereign because We were using up
our credit to make good the deficiency.
Immediately the borrowing stopped, down
came our £. The bubble was pricked, and
that phase of inflation ended.
The effects of this inflation were precisely
the same as of every other inflation.
Money at home fell in value; that is to
say, prices rose. With the rise in prices
there was a rise in. wages, though as a rule
the rise in wages lagged behind the other.
We thought we were having wonderfully
prosperous times. We did not realise that
the prosperity was largely artificial—the
prices artificial, the wages artificial. We
did not realise that we were undergoing
the process of inflation just as surely as if
we had issued a few million extra notes.
Whenever a banker makes a loan he ties a
string to it. He wants it back presently:
meantime it has to get to work and earn its
interest. The loan granted, the money it
represents goes into circulation. But if it
only increases consumption, its one effect
must be inflation—to send up prices. Sup-
pose a million pounds were added to the
currency—or suppose “credits” were “re-
leased” for a million—nominally to assist
the pastoral industry. If that million were
spent in producing more livestock, then the
result of the issue might be to actually
reduce the price of stock. But if it were
spent on buying stock for consumption,
then the effect would be merely to put up
the price of stock, the former competition
being added to by the holders of another
million pounds.
There can thus be an increase in credit
and currency without inflation: it depends,
as we have seen, upon the use that is made
of it. It is possible to conceive even of
a fall in prices.--the usual accompaniment
of deflation—following upon an increase of
credit or currency employed with excep-
tional success in stimulating industry.
Mr. Theodore assures us that his pro-
posed issue would not inflate. It is to be
used as to two-thirds of it to relieve unem-
ployment, as to one-third to assist the
farmers. But what are the chances of more
than a fraction of the total being put to
those productive uses which will alone save
extra currency from inflation? Is it going
to pay for itself? Is it going to result
in enough extra production to counter-
balance the extra consumption that will
follow from people having an extra 18
millions to spend? And, of course, the extra
production must be continuous in order to
keep the money at work.
The truth is we have inflated vigorously
throughout the years of borrowing without
knowing it, and inflation always breeds in-
flation, the less venomous forms being fol-
lowed by the more venomous. The reason
is simple. When one inflationary process
stops—borrowing in our case —we discover
that our £ or mark, or whatever it may be,
is not doing its full job. Thus our Trea-
surers find that it takes £l3O 10s. of taxes
in Australia to pay £lOO of interest debt
in London. Taxes are increased accordingly;
and when the increased taxes produce less
revenue instead of more, the easy way is to
issue more currency in order that more may
flow back to the Treasury. But the issue
of more currency only adds to the troubles
caused by the earlier inflation—and so the
shocking business goes on. Inflation never
begins as a deliberate policy. Accidental
inflation due to war, or unrecognised in-
flation due to “development” loans, starts
it; whether we go on from that point
through easy stages to wholesale repudia-
tion and ruin, as Germany did, or pain-
fidly fight our way back, as Britain did, is
decided chiefly by the circumstances of the
country and the courage or cowardice of its
Governments.
LABOR AT THE CROSS ROADS.
For 40 the Labor party has been kept
undivided; and nothing but singular astute-
ness, combined with a certain relentlessness,
could have accomplished it. Repeatedly the
‘executive has seemed to be brutal in its ex-
communications. But it knew human nature.
It knew that ninety-nine men out of a hun-
dred in every great organisation are for most
of their lives automatons, manipulated by
the other one. So the militants have always
had their way. No lesson is more carefully
taught them by their European guides than
this: the majority is in the hands of the
minority. “Figures do not make law,” says
Lagardelle, “and numbers do not rule. The
select group allures the masses and directs
them in the combat The mass instinc-
tively follows.” And Pouget, another Com-
munist expositor, talks contemptuously of
democracy because it professes to give the
lead to the “unconscious” and lazy, as
though such a thing was possible. So the
militants, whatever you like to call them,
believe that they can keep any movement
militant by robbing the non-militant majo-
rity of their leaders; and without compas-
sion or compunction they have done this in
the Labor party. Which explains why it
has undergone fundamental changes and
still preserved its unity.
But it looks as though the time has
come when the old tricks will not succeed,
and division is inevitable. What the suc-
cessive groups of militants have overlooked
is that a community of Australian workmen
is not the same as a community of Rus-
sian peasants, and that, while the latter
could be depended upon to remain an
“amorphous mass,” an “unconscious” majo-
rity in the hands of a “conscious” mino-
rity, no body of Australian workmen can
be trusted to remain for ever inert and
accept leadership of which it disapproves.
What has happened in Australia is that, as
old and trusted leaders have been frozen out
or thrust out by militants, their friends of
the rank and file have been deft behind,
willing to be led by the new leaders in
most things, yet still capable of rebellion if
asked to go too far. How far they have
been asked to go, few have hitherto real-
ised. The leaders of the new order have
done their work well—so well that not one
in a hundred Labor followers of the days
of Watson, McGowen and Tom Price has
realised the hold the Communists had got
upon the movement in Australia, or whither
they were leading it, Proceeding on their
customary assumption that the majority
is always in the hands of the minority, they
concentrated upon Sydney, merely setting
up isolated strong-posts in the other States.
Just as they have been able to control the
movement in N. S. Wales by continuous
direct action, and by dumping every non-
militant leader who stood in the way, so
they hoped and designed to control the
whole Australian movement through a com-
pact Sydney minority.
The leaders of the Federal Government
should, of course, have promptly accepted
the challenge. They knew, or should have
known, who their opponents were. What
the Australian Labor party is confronted
with is Bolshevism pure and simple. Sydney
Labor is officially almost entirely in its
hands; and by its most important State
legislation of this session it proposes to set
up soviets and hand the control of industry
over to them. The whole purpose of its
activities, legislative and administrative, is
in accordance with the Third International’s
“order of combat,” as summarised by Lenin
himself:—
“(1) The dissolution and breakdown of
the whole capitalist system.
"(2) To take possession of the power of
government in order to substitute for it the
apparatus of the proletarian power.
“(3) This new apparatus must incorporate
the dictatorship of the working class ( i.e.,
the Soviet) and the overthrow of the ex-
ploiting class.
“(4) The suppression [expropriation] of
private property and transfer to the prole-
tarian state under the administration of the
working class; including the abolition of
capitalist agricultural production.
“(5) The disarming of the bourgeoisie and
its agents and the arming of the prole-
tariat.”
In the pursuit of these aims the greatest
latitude is allowed. The 1.W.W., the Ameri-
can agent of the “world revolution,” has
instructed its followers:—
“It is the historic mission of the working
class to do away with capitalism.... The
tactics used are determined solely by the
power of the organisation to make good
in their use. The question of right and
wrong does not concern us.”
“The proletarian mass must fill all Govern-
mental positions, must control all func-
tions,” the Bolshevik organisation in Glas-
gow was lately instructed; and apparently
the same instruction has been issued in
Sydney. Further, patriotism is an absurdity:
nobody ought to worry whether one’s
country has any reputation or not. “For
a revolutionary syndicalist,” says Brouilhet,
“the idea of native country is not neces-
sary. It associates groups whose interests
are conflicting, and it divides those whose
interests are identical.” “Our class is our
fatherland,” another says; “capitalism is
our only enemy.” And Lagardelle, quoted
already, says “syndicalists fight the State for
the same reason as they fight the em-
ployers; both are joint forces, which play
into the hands of each other. The destruc-
tion of State is a preliminary condition to
the triumph of the proletariat.” This is the
goal at which the Bolsheviks aim; and the
plans recommended make it easier to under-
stand some of the otherwise unintelligible
things done by the Government of N. S.
Wales and those by whom it is directed;
for in Sydney the teal seat of government
has been transferred from Parliament to the
Trades Hall.
It is quite open to the Labor party of
any State or of Australia to be a Com-
munist party, with headquarters in Russia.
But no party which was anti-Communist in
origin and is still professedly anti-Com-
munistic has the right to become in fact
Communistic; still less has it a right to
make a tool of the Labor party. Because
thousands of members at last realise this,
the Labor party has come to the place
where the long road branches; and there
will be more truth and sincerity in the
movement when the two forces, the Com-
munist and the anti-Communist, the new
and the old, take each its own course.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Mr. Lang, the Governor and the
Legislative Council.
It is admitted that only in extreme circum-
stances would an Australian Governor
be justified in sending his Ministers to the
people so long as they commanded a majo-
rity of the popular Chamber. But the
power to dissolve Parliament has been very
carefully left in the hands of the Governor;
and there can be no doubt it has been left
there so that it may be used in those
extreme circumstances mentioned. Dicey,
in “The Law of the Constitution,” laid it
down clearly:—
“The reason why the House can in accord-
ance with the Constitution be deprived of
power and of existence is that an occasion
has arisen in which there is fair reason to
suppose that the opinion of the House is
not the opinion of the electors.... A dis-
solution is allowable, or necessary, whenever
the wishes of the Legislature are or may
fairly be presumed to be different from the
wishes of the nation.”
The question has arisen whether Mr. Lang
and his Ministers are kept in office by a
legislature whose wishes “may fairly be pre-
sumed to be different from the wishes of the
nation.” What facts support such a pre-
sumption?
Without a general election d is obvi-
ously impossible to produce positive proof
that “the wishes of the nation” are “differ-
ent from” “the wishes of the Legislature.”
The evidence must therefore be circum-
stantial .
In the first place Mr. Lang sought election
as the leader of the Labor party in N. S.
Wales, and was supported by three Federal
Labor Ministers. He told the people that
both he and his party were opposed to re-
pudiation, and on that he was elected.
When presently he declared what his policy
was, the leader of every other Labor Gov-
ernment in Australia disavowed him and
his policy. The three Ministers who sup-
ported his policy were ejected from the
Federal Labor Government. It is quite
obvious, therefore, that in the opinion of
the Federal Labor Government and of
every other Labor Government in Australia,
Mr. Lang’s financial policy is a perversion
of the Labor policy. Yet it was as a Labor
candidate that Mr. Lang sought and won
election—won it not merely by suppressing
his views with regard to repudiation, but
by making a false declaration.
After the breach with Federal Ministers
two Parliamentary vacancies were filled in
one day in N. S. Wales. For one Mr. Lang
did not nominate a candidate; for the other,
one of the Labor strongholds, the entire
force of the Lang Government was brought
to bear. Mr. Ward, his nominee, won the
seat by 3643 votes; seventeen months pre-
viously his Labor predecessor had won it by
13,522 votes. A proportionate loss of votes
throughout the State would leave Mr. Lang
with a miserable minority of followers: the
Lang candidate gained 52 per cent, of the
votes polled as against the Labor can-
didate’s 69 per cent, at the general election.
Supporting this circumstantial evidence
are the all-too-manifest outbreaks of ugly
feeling almost throughout the State, from
the far north-east to the extreme south-west.
It would be t absurd to close one’s eyes to
the gravity of these threatenings. We shall
not meet them by calling the leaders rebels,
or dubbing the rank ancl file assassins. The
seriousness of the position is sufficiently
indicated when one of the leaders of the
party of which Mr. Lang is the Parliamen-
tary leader advised the Labor Conference:
“If you can get any guns take hold of them.
I don’t say use them—that would be sedi-
tion—but get hold of them.” In a law-
abiding community this is overwhelming
evidence that there exists a large feeling
of exasperation which is liable to pass on
into civil war.
There are still two Houses of Parliament
in N. S. Wales. In the very serious circum-
stances of the moment, and in view of the
difficulties surrounding the position oi the
Governor, does it not seem to be the duty
of the Legislative Council to express its
opinion as to whether the other House is
now fairly representative of the people?
True, it cannot speak with authority on
the subject; but in view of the enormous
discontent, the widespread distress and the
ugly feeling, culminating in the call of a Labor
conference delegate to his colleagues and
followers to arm themselves and in their
prompt response with a “Labor Army”: in
view of these things, surely the Leg. Council
is bound to put its view before his Excel-
lency if it believes the other Chamber ought
to be sent to the people in order to ascer-
tain whether its wishes are their wishes.
4,
Fixed Interest Charges.
The Lang Government in N. S. Wales is
pushing through a bill to fix the rates of
interest chargeable on loans of every
description, excluding only those made over-
seas and those made to and by the Com-
monwealth Bank and the Savings Bank of
N. S. Wales. The rates range from H P-c-
-on three-month bank deposits and 3 p.c. on
Government loans to 5 p.c. on first mort-
gages and practically all other securities
except second and subsequent mortgages, on
which 6 p.c. may be charged.
The. bill shows either a complete mis-
understanding of what interest is or a deter-
mination to produce chaos and revolution,
with a Soviet State, of course, as the objec-
tive.
All money is at any given time worth
approximately the same rent or interest;
the great variation in rates charged is due
to (1) the necessity for making a large or
small addition to a fund for. bad debts; and
(2) the availability of the money. There
are loans which are worth not 5 p.c. p.a.
but 50! p.c., just as there are horses (as
several of Mr. Lang’s advisers will be able
to assure him) that are not worth
at 50 to 1. A few months ago the Merron
Estate Co. was offering 10 p.c. for deposits-
Within a few months the co. was in liquida-
tion and the chances of creditors recovering
anything substantial are nil. For those who
could afford to lose their principal it was
nevertheless a fair risk at 30 or 40 p.c.,
although even at 30 or 40 p.c. the lender
would have lost money, as it turned out.
The Merron Estate was not a firs Grate or a
second-rate or even a third-rate security,
but in every lending transaction there i»
risk. There is risk even in lending to the
senior State of Australia, because it is liable
to get a Government which will bring in a
bill to cut down the rate of interest by anj -
thing up to one-half. At the present
moment the outside investor, who will lent
on short call to a reputable institution at
p.c., therefore wants 10 p.c. on N. b.
Wales securities.
It isn’t, then, for the use of money that a
man pays most; it is for the risk of non-
payment of either the whole or part o
principal or interest or both.
If the Lang bill should pass it would stilt
be possible for some few people to get
accommodation in N. S. Wales. But thej
would only be people of substance; tie
poor person or the temporarily very haict-
pressed person, who can now get someone
to share his risks with him for a considera-
tion, would be in a hopeless position. l/ ie
Lang Government’s capacity for kicking
the under-dog is amazing.


New States.
Dear Bulletin, —There is much to be said
for the creation of new States, but immense
difficulties are in the way.
Take the proposed boundaries for the
suggested new State of New England. On
the north, from the Pacific to what they
call the 147th “parallel” (they probably
mean meridian), thence to the Darling
River. Do they take in any land west of the
Darling? Not a yard! Such territory is re-
mote; not particularly good country ; rain-
fall very uncertain; very expensive to
administer. Thence the boundary goes south-
ward, taking in Walgett, etc., and bearing
east to take in Cessnock and Maitland. That
is to say, the New England State would con-
tain by far the richest and best land in
N.S.W., if not in all Australia, and much
the best coalmines so far discovered in the
continent. How could the mother State
consent to such spoliation as this? It
would be bad enough if the western bound-
ary coincided with that of the State as far
as the 32nd parallel; but anything like
poor country is left for mother to struggle
with.
And so in regard to Riverina: they would
want all the country between the Mur-
rumbidgee and Murray; very likely more.
This would be the second-best area in N. S.
Wales.
It is difficult to see how anything like a
fair arrangement could be made.—Yours,
L. E. Laavford.

The World and Its War Debts.
When it came to stumping up after the
war both John Bull and Jonathan B. found
it impossible to collect in full what was
owing to them, and repayments in all cases
had to be adjusted to ability to pay. John
wanted to cancel the whole box and dice
of debts and reparations, a transaction on
which he would—on paper, anyway—have
been a heavy loser; but Jonathan couldn’t
see it that way. Here is a bird’s-eye view
of what happened ( the amounts can-
celled are computed by comparison of the
capitalised value of the debts if an average
of 5 per cent, were paid on them, as origin-
ally agreed, with the capitalised value under
actual funding arrangements ): —

Under the funding arrangements that
have been made Britain pays about
£34,000,000 per annum to America, and re-
ceives from France, Italy and other debtors
a little over half that amount. Under the
Young Plan Germany is expected to put
enough into the Eritish Treasury to enable
J. Bull to pay America, but there are
very few people in the world optimistic
enough to believe that this arrangement
will endure for the 56 years it is scheduled
to run. As the position stands, Britain’s
liability in respect of war debts (capitalised
at 5 per cent.) over and above liabilities
which her war debtors have honored is
£420,500,000. Of a total liability of
£1,477,200,000 accepted by the Allies,
£1,127,700,000 is due to America; and as
Various monetary experts prophesied years
ago, the acceptance of this tribute is not
relieving her of the social troubles that
infest the rest of the world.

Company Law Reform.
Among the many afflictions Australia en-
dures is the perennial clashing of State-
made laws. When Federation came there
was a vague idea that the nuisance would
be abated. Instead, the Commonwealth
has added fresh ingredients to the hash, the
last state of which is worse than the first.
Outstanding examples of exasperating con-
fusion are the 30-odd company laws of the
various States. The most venerable is a
Queensland Act passed the year of the
separation from N. S. Wales. The latter State
has company legislation some 60 years old,
while several South Aus. and Westralian
enactments date well back in the last cen-
tury. The coming of Federation failed to
relieve the confusion, for, though Premiers’
conferences have continually advised the
passing of a Federal Companies Act, con-
stitutional difficulties have stood in the way.
Two Australian States, however, have
taken a way out of the difficulty which,
by its very simplicity, should appeal to
other members of the Federation. Each
has passed an Act which is a local adapta-
tion of the British Companies Act of 1908,
one of the soundest and completest legis-
lative enactments which have ever received
the Royal assent. There is nothing to pre-
vent the other States from following this
example. Though a uniform Act for the
whole of the Commonwealth would not
result, the law on this most important sub-
ject would be practically standardised
throughout Australia.
An Ancient Safety-valve.
Dear Bulletin, —In political wisdom the
ancient Greeks were pre-eminent. Even
to-day, in New South Wales, we might take
a few hints from the Athenians of the
fifth century b.c. One remarkable Hel-
lenic institution was ostracism. It was a
device for putting an end to strife
and faction. It was the exercise of a
right by the people of Athens to banish,
for a time, any person whose con-
tinued presence appeared to be dangerous
to the liberty of the citizens or inconsis-
tent with their political equality. The
people were asked once a year whether they
wished to exercise this right. If they agreed,
a public assembly ( ecclesia ) was held, in
which they gave their votes against any
citizen by writing his name on what the
Greeks called an ostrakon —a small piece of
earthenware. ( Ostrakon, literally an oyster-
shell.) No name was proposed to the
people; no charge was brought against any-
one. Each citizen wrote on his tablet the
name of the person he considered most dan-
gerous to the peace and welfare of the com-
munity. If 6000 votes were recorded against
any one citizen, he was required to leave
the city within 10 days, and to remain be-
yond the borders of Attica for 10 (later
reduced to five) years. It was not con-
sidered a punishment for a crime, but a pre-
cautionary measure. The property and civil
rights of such a man were not affected. A
decree of the citizens might reinstate him.
Some of the greatest men of Athens—Mil-
tiades, Themistocles, Aristides, Cimon and
Alcibiades—were subjected to this treat-
ment. It is interesting to speculate on
what would happen if we had a similar
practice in New South Wales to-day. Who
would be the man to go?—Yours, Daniel
Levy.
A Plea for the Idle Poor.
F. W. Rowley, for 16 years Secretary of
Labor in Maoriland, has occupied the first
two years of his retirement in writing an
account of the development of Labor laws
in the Dominion, with comments which he
was not able to make while he was in the
service. His sympathies are very strongly
with working men and women, and such pre-
judices as he has are obviously in favor of
the bottom-dog; but in the process of grow-
ing up with the M.L. Labor Department
the first in the world—he has learned to
respect facts.
Unemployment, he sees, of course, is not
an occasional phenomenon. It is chronic,
owing to the varying labor demand from
season to season. Nor is it particularly the
product of such periods of trade depression
as the world is now passing through: indeed,
it migffit as logically be claimed to be the
product of peak periods of prosperity. Mr.
Rowley’s proposals are aimed at stabilisa-
tion of the labor demand throughout the
year and through trade cycles; provision of
new employment for workers thrown idle
by the use of labor-saving machinery; the
training of bo3 ? s, especially in skilled crafts
as part of their schooling, and control of
certain phases of industry and commerce
by a “board of business men.” It is sug-
gested that an “employment stabilisation
fund” should be established, the funds being
obtained by a levy on the proceeds of ex-
ported primary produce in years when prices
rise above an agreed-upon norm. In addi-
tion to managing this fund, which would
be used to provide avenues of productive
employment, the board would “iron out”
as far as possible the present-day seasonal
fluctuations.
It is when we come to the manner in
which the employment stabilisation fund is
to be used that the argument begins. Mr.
Rowley proposes that farmers should be
enabled to employ labor to carry out im-
provements on their holdings subsidised
f rom the fund to the extent of the differ-
ence between the actual cost of the work
a nd the value of it to the farmer. Also,
each year, there would be a programme of
“reserved public works,” so arranged as to
take up the surplus of unskilled labor,
Mr. Rowley estimates that men on such
wor k are 2 5 to 33 per cent, less efficient
than men in ordinary employment, and he
WO uld make the difference a charge on
the stabilisation fund. It would have to be
considered whether this would not reward
s i o th and inefficiency
‘ The devel nt second ,„y industries

motion and pooling of manufacturing re-
sources is advocated, with a very iauc i
larger degree of factory specialisation. nt
after following all the expemnen s caie-
fully this very experienced officer lecom-
mends profit-sharing as the most ope i
nmthod of securing peace, goo wi an

Mr. Rowley is on sound ground when he
insists that unemployment will not be abol-
ished until each nation takes a comprehen-
sive view ot its industries and arranges
and adjusts them just as any skilled admin-
istrator would map out the functions of all
the parts of the machinery oi a single busi-
ness or industry. He is confident That this
can be done without standing the ■' social
system on its head or indulging in civil
warfare. His method, though it may sound
prosaic to the Communists, seems a lot less
messy than smashing everything and leaving
the evolution of a new order to the most
active specialists in sabotage and murder.
“THE GRAVEST ASPECT.”
“Now I come to the gravest aspect of this question. I make no charges, but if it is possible to unearth the discloser of
the messages he will be unearthed. The leader of the Opposition said ‘Hear, hear but he does not decline to use this infor-
mation, got by vile treachery."— Prime Minister Scullin on the revelations of his part in the High Court appointments.
MRS. SCULLIN: Which I'm not in the least ashamed of ’avin’ dirty linen to wash, dearie. All I mind is that some dirty
ound should ’ave gone and told the master about it.”


POLITICAL
POINTS
Lang’s plea for his bill to fix rates of
interest is that lesser Premiers have talked
about the impossibility of paying: it was
left for him, the one courageous man of the
crowd, to cut down the rate of interest.
But Lang’s thoughts are all muddled, as
usual. What has been declared to be doubt-
ful was our ability to export enough in a
bad season to pay overseas interest; and
Lang’s bill doesn’t touch overseas interest
at all. There has never been any doubt
about our ability to pay our domestic in-
terest bill: that’s a mere paper debt. The
foreign bill is a gold debt.
There are parts of Australia that wouldn’t
know there was a depression but for the
Slangs and Scullius and their taxgatherers.
Hawkesbury farmers are doing well, and
Windsor is as solid a little town as can be
found anywhere. The Darling Downs wheat
areas, too; they have had a good harvest, and
there are no complaints about, the price—
-3650 growers have received 3s. Id. a bushel,
with another 9d. to come. And going _to
Bridgetown, in the heart of the Westralian
apple country, the R.S.L. president and sec-
retary were told by Digger growers that the
crop was good, the overseas price satisfac-
tory, and there was fruit to spare for their
mates in hospital.
The Scullidores are out with a new
“policy.” The tax on public-service salaries
is to be shifted downward, the exemption
being £250 instead of £750, and there is to
be a special tax on interest, mentioned at
3s. 6d. in the £, though some want to make
it 19s. lid. “But I will say definitely,”
said the Priminister, striking an attitude,
“that we will not cut pensions or the basic
wage.” There is, however, no reason why
the Government shouldn’t investigate _ its
pensioners to see if they are all genuine;
and there are other possibilities to be con-
sidered. One is the abolition of the baby
bonus. Then the Auditor-General might be
asked for a candid opinion ( which he gener-
ally seems to have about him) as to whether
it would be cheaper to abandon Canberra,
and, if so, how to go about the business.
“Beaten in the State Full Court and the High
Court on the question of Upper House abolition, the
Slang Government is appealing to the British Law
Lords, regardless of expense.”
“Off to the Privy Council, Andy! As a
great democrat I will trust anybody ex-
cept the people.”
Another Wheat Bill has been introduced
by Minister Moloney, and another scheme
is now before the public in definite shape,
which, however, may be altered at any
moment. A bounty of 6d. per bushel is
to be paid on wheat available for export
between the beginning of October, 1930, and
the end of October, 1931. This should run
to about 4|d. a bushel all round, though
the promise of 3s. a bushel all round has
gone into the dustbin to join the previous
promise of 4s. a bushel. The bounty is to
cost £3,500,000 in Theodore’s money if the
“fiduciary” issue comes off. Another
£2,500,000 of paper is to be lent to neces-
sitous farmers, who are numerous, through
the State Governments, and the usual
charges of favoritism towards political sup-
porters may be expected.
Queensland’s Governor, Sir John Good-
win, is voluntarily taking 10 p.c. less pay. He
had to consult the Dominions Office, which
graciously approved, so the public-spirited
ex-army doctor will manage with £2700
p.a. The N.S.W., Vic. and S.A. Governors
get £SOOO apiece; the Westralian allowance
is £3339. Isaacs, G.-G., draws £12,000,
though £IO,OOO was the salary in much more
prosperous times.
The special conference of the S. Aus.
A.L.P. lasted five days, and closed with the
scalps of Premier Hill, Attorney-General
Denny and Chief Secretary Whitford still
intact. But it was a close thing: 86 dele-
gates were for expelling Hill and his lieu-
tenants and 107 against. The contest will
be renewed at the first favorable opportunity.
It will be the Hogans’ turn next. Censure
motions galore are to be launched against
them at the Vic. A.L.P. conference on April
3. The Railwaymen’s Union, for its part,
wants conference to condemn the whole dem-
nition Parliamentary Labor party.
It would be a sensible proceeding in this
time of financial stress to pass a law enact-
ing that the baby bonus shall cease at the
end of January, 1932. That would give
abundant notice to the baby that is on the
road, so there would be no breach of faith,
and the subsequent baby could look after
himself. It would be more honorable to
leave him to his own resources than to give
him a tip paid in bad money. The baby
allowance, or the baby’s father’s drink allow-
ance, costs about £650,000 a year, including
office expenses. It was invented owing to
the arrogance of people who wanted to show
that Australia could afford it even if no
other country could, and that insufferable
pomp is out of date. It was never anything
else, but in the big loan days it didn’t look
so insane as it does now.
If Theodore’s Dubious Currency Bill is
defeated the farmers won’t get the bounty
and the loan mentioned in the Government’s
latest change of policy. And if it is passed
the consequent depreciation may leave them
where they are, or more so, for there is talk
of shovelling £18,000,000 of doubtful money
on the market, £12,000,000 being for “public
works.” The farmers have really become
only a minor issue in the con-
fusion. In any case, the pro-
posed aid of 41d. a bushel,
should it eventuate and the new
money pass muster, will only
help till October 31, and then
the wolf is expected to be glar-
ing through the keyhole again.
The new plan is a miserable
substitute for the Perkins
sales tax on flour. That would
have given the cruelly-deceived
farmers another 7d. or 8d. a
bushel without any fancy ex-
periments in unprotected and
inflated paper money; but it
would have meant that union-
ists and civil servants wouldn’t
get bread at a price based on wheat at Is.
7d. a bushel net, sd the Scullidores wouldn’t
look at it.
The Commonwealth had 72,667 incapaci-
tated soldiers and 155,809 of their depen-
dants on its war-pensions list at June, 1928,
Two years later the numbers had increased
to 74,578 and 170,437, though new war
veterans aren’t being born. In six years,
moreover, old-age and invalid pensioners
increased from 155,671 to 218,500. The
whole business calls for investigation before
Australia takes to defrauding thrifty
old people who collect a scanty income from
investments in Government securities or to
the printing of fishy paper “money.” It would
be unspeakable meanness to grudge susten-
ance to our damaged soldiers and their de-
pendants, or to cripples and aged people
without resources ; but if the pensions lists
are being bloated out of all reason inquiry
shouldn’t be sacrificed to sentiment.
South Africa is making no bones about
cutting administrative costs. The tiny civil
service—Australia’s is about a dozen times
as big—has not only been drastically re-
duced in personnel, with salary reductions
for those retained, but working hours have
been lengthened; they are to be from 8.30
to 5 on week days and from 8.30 to 1 on
Saturdays. And there are to be no new
appointments till further orders. On depart-
mental expenditure alone it is reckoned that
there will be a saving of upwards of a mil-
lion this year.
Although the Vic. A.N.A. conference at
Warrnambool was above the average annual
corroboree, the main impression brought
away by delegates -vyas that it was unwieldy.
There were upwards of 300 delegates, and
100 is enough if any worth-while business
is to be done. Widgeroo branch, with 25
members, is entitled to the same representa-
tion as Collingwood branch, which has more
than 1000. A declaration in favor of the
Canadian system of national union; in prefer-
ence to the Australian was the principal
thing decided, but A.N.A. decisions don’t
impress people much now.
Newspaper-baron Rothermere, having chal-
lenged Baldwin to meet him in a platform
debate on the Conservative leader’s qualifi-
cations for his job, received the dry reply
that the challenge would never have been
made had there been any thought that it
would be accepted. It is the same with that
form of cheap defiance that we so often hear
in Parliament: “I’ll resign my seat if you’ll
resign yours and come and fight me in my
constituency.” Nobody is expected to close
with the offer, and nobody ever does.
The University vote, which the Rammacs
tried to abolish the other day, thereby im-
perilling their Electoral Bill, is about the
last survival of what were once called “fancy
franchises.” Among them various seats of
learning send 12 members to a House of
Commons 615 strong. Oxford and Cam-
bridge get two members apiece, and London
one; seven other minor and newer English
universities are lumped together and assigned
two members. The Scottish universities re-
turn three legislators; the Welsh Uriiversity
and Queen’s (Belfast) contribute the re-
maining couple. Of the dozen ’Varsity mem-
bers eight were Conservatives at the last
reckoning and three Liberals; there was one
lone Independent. It is natural enough
that Labor should wish to see all such seats
scrapped.
“Mr. Scullin says his Government will not resign
until it is defeated in the House.”
SCULLIN: “You may jeer at me and threaten
me, but you cannot break my manly
spirit. I will not come out.”
People whose pay has been reduced a
shilling in the pound by Slang’s unemploy-
ment-relief tax have been wondering what is
done with their money. It is increasingly
evident that no • small proportion of it is
going into the hands of swindlers who travel
from place to place collecting rations oblig-
ingly furnished by the mug Government and
throwing away what they can’t sell; one
nomad was caught with a hundredweight of
groceries the other day. And what isn’t
required for dole-drawers, bogus and genuine,
is being distributed among municipalities,
mostly improvident, for dirt jobs. If farm-
ers were assisted to improve their holdings
the whole community would be the richer.
A system of rebates to taxpayers providing
extra employment would also be helpful. But
this mob can’t think out anything construc-
tive.
SHEODCRE THEODORE: “Here is thy trusty
lance, brave Don Scullin. Have a good,
whang at yon wicked ogre.”
In Melbourne sustenance swindling has
received a check. I’ollowing on a case in
which a man got a month for drawing the
dole while he was earning £4 15s. a week,
30 recipients of the Government’s bounty
in the same suburb asked to have their
names crossed out. In the Fitzroy ; area
the news that inspectors had, been appointed
led to 400 people cancelling their claims for
relief. The inspectors later moved to Carl-
ton, and 250 individuals there also sud-
denly discovered that they were no longer
in need of assistance.
Lazzarini, M.H.R., has given notice that
he will attempt something serious at some
stage of the Dubious Paper-money Bill. The
joint-stock banks, he holds, “have no legal
right to issue cheques,” so' he proposes that
after the end of this year “no person or
institution or association of institutions
shall operate the cheque system.” The
penalty is to be 14 years’ gaol—not concur-
rent, but cumulative. A definition of “the
cheque system” is to come later, but appa-
rently everybody in a large way of business
is to have three large trunks of money beside
him (notes, silver and bronze), and pay
people in cash, and a crowd of thieves will
be waiting outside the office to rob them
as they leave. The cause of this is probably
some sort of a germ from Moscow, where
all strange political germs grow.
_ The Newtown (Sydney) municipal coun-
cil had before it a cheerful mayoral
minute the other day. It set forth,
among other things, that the year had closed
with a credit balance, that no overdraft
had been required for 20 years, that
a lot of works for which money might
have been borrowed had been paid for out of
revenue, and that the council’s total loan
indebtedness was a mere £22,000, whereas
under the Local Government Act it was em-
powered to borrow up to about 20 times that
amount. _ After the aldermen had shaken
hands with one another, so to speak, one of
them moved “that a copy of the minute be
forwarded to the Prime Minister and the
State Premiers to show how efficiently muni-
cipal councils can manage their finances and
the very happy results of living within their
income.” The admirable suggestion was nega-
tived —possibly the Labor councillors thought
it would be too much like “rubbing it in.”
N.S.W. country Labor members, State as
well as Federal, are moodily wondering how
much support Lang’s Minister Gosling has
cost them by trying to be clever. After the
great anti-default meeting at Wagga Gosling
mentioned with a sneer that only £3OO-odd
had been deposited in the hat. It was really
a sneer at poverty Soor which the Gosling party
is largely responsible; ready money is scarce
in the Riverina because the farmers put all
they had into their wheat crops, trusting in
the promises of loons that they would get
4s. a bushel, and of liars that they would
get 7s. 6d., only to be “had.” The minor
goose went farther
I do not think that we really ought to take these
people seriously. They want to strut and posture
like plaster Napoleons, wearing newspaper crowns
and wooden swords. If there was any real danger
I do not think they would be present. Let me
inform the hon. member that these delightful Arca-
dians, with their rural simplicity, will be properly
attended to.
When there was “real danger,” fighting in
which the weapons were not “wooden
swords,” a large proportion of the men at
the Wagga meeting went half across the
world in order to be in it. Gosling stayed
in Sydney and stood for Parliament.
To judge by the slump in the price of Aus-
tralian securities on the New York market
Brother Jonathan takes an even more pessi-
mistic view of “fiduciary notes” and “the
scaling-down of interest” than John Bull
does. One explanation may be that Jonathan
knows so much more about repudiation. Eight
States went in for tlie“default-and-be-damned”
policy, almost wholly at Britain’s expense,
the amount of the fraud, including interest,
being about £70,000,000. And 11 States (the
defunct Confederacy) have a joint dishonored
p.n. for about £13,000,000. In the second
case the lenders deserved to lose their money
because they gambled on the success of an
insurrection, but the £70,000,000 was unadul-
terated steal, the work of politicians who
said there was money to be made by the
policy of “running a moist pen slick through
everything and starting fresh,” while the
central Government looked on. The aggre-
gate Yank possibly thinks that Lang may
repudiate, and that our central authority
may not worry much except as a matter of
form.
Heartened by the High Court ruling that
it can’t be abolished without a referendum,
the N.S.W. Leg. Council has shelved
Slang’s “Conciliation and Arbitration” bill by
referring it to a committee. The bill
disqualifies non-unionists, company unions,
wliarf-lumpers’ unions which have no use
for the Waterside Workers’ Federation, and
railwaymen’s unions which object to being
bossed by Chapman, the repudiationist from
Moscow; in fact all unions not affiliated to
the Trades Hall. And members of Trades
Hall unions are disqualified if they
are not “financial”—which may mean that
they are too poor to pay for their union
tickets or jib at subsidising Labor politicians,
strike-promoters or Russian agents. Some-
how it recalls a tale of the bad old times con-
cerning six prisoners who were doing their
sentence in a primitive coalpit and who
planned an escape. An inner circle of three
decided to disqualify the other three, so that
their last day or two’s rations might help
to provision the expedition. They were dis-
qualified with pickaxes accordingly. Two of
the remaining three decided that the third
was a superfluous consumer of provender,
and knocked him out at the, last moment.
Then the survivors, each feeling that the
other was too selfish and exclusive, had
a disagreement on the ladder, and dropped
to the bottom with a thud. It was all the
result of too much disqualification.
The time will probably arrive when the
ownership or control of political papers by
one man will be limited by law. The
ownership of, say, ten successful press
organs means that he has ten votes, though
readers are allowed to suppose that his
group, when he is disappointed or enraged,
stands for ten separate and spontaneous out-
bursts of public opinion. Ten swelled heads
are too many for any individual. The pro-
prietor of many shops or factories may be
in heated and grasping pursuit of wealth, but
the man with many papers is also after
power, and is apt to make a devil of a fuss
if his claim isn’t recognised. Beaverbrook,
made a Lloyd George baron in 1917, and
Rothermere, made a Lloyd George viscount
in 1919, mistake themselves for a separate
House of Parliament because they are so
much supported by themselves in their own
papers. The other day, however, ex-Prime
Minister Baldwin roused himself from his
usual rather torpid condition to explain,
apropos the St. George’s by-election (which
his man won easily), that Beaverbrook and
Rothermere are only a pair of new Upper-
Housers, though they chance to own various
papers, and a flock of editors, and some
rather crude ideas, including the one about
Empire Freetrade, and that, in fact, they
don’t amount to much more than punk. So
if either hopes to become an earl, a marquis
or a duke he will have to look elsewhere.

the Trade has furnished a compensation fund

Maoriland was a bit ahead of Australia
in ensuring the safety of trust funds
held by solicitors. A few years ago the
dishonest lawyer was rather a frequent cir-
cumstance in the Dominion; one result was
the diversion of money into the Public Trust
Office which last year administered estates
to the value of £53,049,437, as against
£35 570,642 in 1925. The Law Society
secured legislative sanction for building up
a fidelity fund, each practising solicitor being
called on to contribute £5 per annum. It

Sol Malaprop”: For the last week or two
no thoroughly orthodox leading article about
the tottering Cabinets of Scullidore and
Lang has been complete without some allu-
sion to the Writing on the Wall. The writing
is said to have been done by an unnatural
rand on the palace wall at Babylon while
Belshazzar, the king, was giving a dinner to
1000 peers, and it told him that all was up.
The inscription was in some language which
BUSINESS TERMS EXPLAINED.

ISAACS: “Nodding? Vat’s dat?”

no native could understand, and this dimin-
ished its value as a warning. Ultimately a
Jew named Daniel gave his version of the
meaning, and it was taken without audit.
There is reason to believe that Belshazzar
was never more than Crown Prince of Baby-
«niAT ? lld *-he statement that he was the son
of Nebuchadnezzar leaves out four inter-
vening monarchs and jumps a good many
years of history. Darius, the Mede (aged
62), who is said in the Old Testament story
to have extinguished Belshazzar and annexed
his throne, can’t be found in history, though
Cyrus, the Persian, stands out conspicu-
ously. The reason for the Writing on the
Wall is said to have been that Belshazzar
used for common drinking purposes the 5400
gold and silver vessels which his “father”
Nebuchadnezzar stole from the temple at
Jerusalem. But as Solomon’s masterpiece,
which was about the size of a good English
parish church, had been stripped six times
before the Babylonian happened there are
doubts about this final loot. The Book of
Daniel, supposed to have been written some
300 years after the alleged Daniel was *lead,
embodied a patriotic effort to show how a
notable Hebrew took a hand in knocking the
hated Babylonian off his last legs, but the
oft-told tale of the Writing on the Wall
goes chiefly to suggest that billstickers ought
to have been prosecuted even in those days.

“Melhapis”: Baden-Powell’s arrival in '
Australia has loosed a flood of reminiscences
from individuals who served under him in
war or behind him at meals, or otherwise
came in contact with our distinguished visi-
tor. The one I like best comes from a gentle-
man who told a Sydney journal that he first
went to South Africa as a stowaway, “leav-
ing the ship at Johannesburg.” He was at
Mafeking with 8.-P., and distinctly recalls,
not only that officer but “Lady Sarah
Smith,” It is amazing that anyone who
was cooped up in Mafeking with the ebul-
lient Lady Sarah Wilson should have for-
gotten her right name.

“Delver”: We change with the times. The
U.S. “National Geographic Magazine” for
February has an article on “Europe’s New-
est Kingdom,” Albania to wit, near neigh-
bor of Roumania, whence our Federal
Treasurer’s father came. In the course of
it this appears :
If Islam’s ban on statues is ever lifted in Albania,
I hope someone will nominate for marbled immor-
tality one Theodore, of Elbasani. Poignant were
Albania’s early struggles to achieve a written
language. But Master Theodore was a real go-
getter. Having learned of a strange invention
which, according to their inclinations, men accredited
diversely to God and to the Devil, he departed for
Venice to investigate the rumor. When he re-
appeared in Albania his baggage consisted of certain
small caskets containing—what was it that he
guarded so jealously and that weighed so heavily?
“Gold!” whispered his muleteers—“ Venetian
ducats!” Accordingly they slew Master Theodore
and rifled his caskets.
Not gold, but countless bits of base metal met
their gaze. Curses! But hold! What strange
characters on those tiny wedges! Conjurations
surely! Dealings with the Devil! The superstitious
gang fled, leaving Theodore, his throat cut, sur-
rounded by—printers’ pi.
Now our Theodore arrives with a case of
printer’s type, and because it is not gold,
though he tries to make us believe it is as
good, we decide to complete his political
slaughter.

“Baggins” : Those
familiar with North
of England manu-

know what a
“knocker - up” is.
He’s t’owd lad that’s
been pensioned off
by one of the mills
to awake its hands
in time to get dress-
ed and breakfasted
before the whistle
blows. The em-
ployees pay him an
additional Id. a week
for his services, and
in a big town there
may be a dozen
knockers-up. The
North Country tra-
dition is that he
carries with him a
long contraption like
a fishing-rod. With
this he taps at the
upstairs windows
which he cannot
otherwise reach
until the operative
inside is roused.
The South of Eng-
land has of late
years borrowed the
idea, and in London
it has been left to
a lady of Limehouse

ter) to introduce an improvement. She car-
ries, not an unwieldy pole, but a peashooter,
and when this is trained on his window the
sleepiest docker has to show a leg.

“10-2-4”: Sydney Labor Conference’s pri-
vate-enterprise army ig going to make things
awkward for Premier Lang. Premiers find
armies very like families; disciplined ones are
a blessing, the others a curse. The British
Army has been a great comfort to Prime
Minister MacDonald, as it was to his prede-
cessor, the reason being that class feeling has
been trained out of it. This was shown in
Britain’s 1926 strike. The first objective was
to terrorise the middle classes by holding up
transport, and particularly the London milk
supply. It' the scheme had succeeded babies
would have been dying in thousands inside
a week, and the Government might have
fallen in the resulting wave of fury. It
didn’t succeed because the Guards and Tanks
units obeyed orders. They shepherded the
milk from the railways and docks, and
guarded the depot in Hyde Park from which
it was distributed. They were not required

to kill anyone, but from what I saw of them
—and I spent days at the docks while they
were there —they would have done it without
demur if ordered. And with complete
immunity from legal consequences in all pro-
bability. Members of regular armies have,
of course, no more right to shqot or maim
their fellow-citizens than civilians. But the
very fact that they are soldiers (1) makes
rioters chary about attacking them, and (2)
makes them put up with a lot when attacked.
Amateur armies always provoke unnecessary
bloodshed. What happens is that bands of
hooligans, calling themselves members of the
Labor army, or whatever it is, go about
looking for fight—or more commonly loot—
and eventually kill someone. If the Govern-
ment does its duty and has them punished,
the Premier is declared bogus. If it doesn’t,
capitalists form bands of hooligans and
murder members of the Labor army. And
so it goes on. The Germans went through
it all after the war.

“Templar”: The council of the Bar of
N.S.W. has decided that “in future congratu-
lations are not to be offered on behalf of
the Bar to any person upon his appointment
to any judicial position.” It is the safest
way, unless the council is prepared to con-
gratulate everyone who is lifted from the
Bar to the Bench, which apparently it is
not. As long as nobody is officially felici-
tated, nobody will be able to construe the
absence of official felicitation as a slight.

“N. or M.”: Last week a Sydney police
magistrate warned a dozen or so of hardy
toilers, caught playing two-up, that if any
of them had given false names and didn’t
correct them before it was too late they
might look for added penalties. There-
upon a delinquent who had been charged
as Tom Pinch disavowed the name of
that Dickensian character, and attri-
buted the error to a hard-of-hearing-
constable. Still, Pinch might have passed;
more unlikely names than that, iden-
tical with those in real life as well as
fiction, frequently crop up in police courts.
I once saw Matthew Arnold fined five bob
for drunkenness by a goldfields beak. It
wasn’t an assumed name; the drunk had

“Sturt Street”: There was one thing on
which Ballarat will bet —that Jim Scullin
never asked the Prince of Wales whether
lie remembered hi© visit to our old Golden City
in 1920. Jim was in those days managing
director and most things else in the office
of the Ballarat “Evening Echo,” and on the
occasion of Edward P.’s visit the “Echo”
made these, among other remarks: —
No doubt the Prince is deserving of sympathy.
His hands are always plucking at something, and
he walks with jerky steps. All the time he smiles.
The smile is so automatic that it encourages no
response. There is a gruesome simile that compares
a smile to a plate on a coffin. It remained for
Ballarat to clinch that simile. In order to enable
the Prince to stand while he smiled, the powers
that be arranged to place a handle on the side of
the motor-car. The handle was the handle of a
coffin.
A boy who still retains some memory of what
happened during the war was standing in front of
the City Hall. He saw the flag with the Prince’s
crest of three white feathers, and the German motto
“Ich Dien.” “Didn’t the Prince go to the war?”
he suddenly asked. “I believe he did,” replied his
mother. “Then why did he get three white feathers?”
asked the young hopeful.
The Caledonian Society was grouped round the
statue of “Rabbie” Burns, and one seemed to hear
the ploughman poet menacingly declaim:—
“The injured Stuart race is gone,
A race outlandish fills the throne—
An idiot race, to honor lost.
Who know them best despise them most.”
Not a bad journalist, Ballarat used to think,
of the frothy sort. Never any depth in
him, and bis paper was the “Echo” that he
called it.

“Penfield”: Knox, of the Sydney “Evening
News,” put up a great fight to save
his old and respected soap-box. Associated
Newspapers, which bought it and then fell
into the ditch, decided to abandon it till
things brighten; but staffs can’t live on
hope, and the hope of a newspaper resurrec-
tion is a drier bone than most. Knox tried
to induce the board to carry on by getting
the staffs of all the Associated papers to
accept, a 15 p.c. cut on certain terms; and
though the A.J.A. (the journalists’ union)
warmly supported the scheme, the direc-
tors decided that they must close down.
The. troubles under which so many Aus-
tralian papers of one sort and an-
other are collapsing came at them from
two sides. They can’t escape the £1 per
ton duty and the primage and the 30 per cent,
exchange premium because not an ounce of
newsprint is made in Australia, and these
things add from 40 to 50 per cent, to the
cost of paper; and, whereas the importer
was nearly always a very good advertiser,
the Australian manufacturer is mostly a
very poor one, wherefore advertising revenue
has fallen, so far as the largest papers are
concerned, from 40 to 55 per cent. With

a rise of 4 to 5 per cent, in costs and a fall
of 40 to 55 per cent, in advertising revenue,
no wonder there are corrugated brows in most
Australian newspaper offices.

“Gullewa”: lon Idriess’s “Prospecting for
Gold” (B. 18/3/’3l) recalls to me a some-
what similar but less ambitious work by an
earlier journalist-CMTO-prospector, the amaz-
ingly versatile F. :C. B. Vosper. Arriv-
ing in Geraldton (W.A.) about 1892,
stone-broke, Vosper wrote his “Prospec-
tor’s Companion” in the back room
of a dingy little beersliop inside of a
fortnight. Later it was published in paper-
covers, and a very useful little vade mecum
it was. Within a few years the author had
become one of the best-known men in West-
ralia; he had won a goldfields seat in the
Assembly, founded the Perth “Sunday
Times” and thrown himself into the Federa-
tion campaign, demanding special concessions
for Westralia, with extraordinary energy. He
was a candidate for the first Com-
monwealth Senate, with an excellent chance
of topping the poll, when he died at
32. I wonder if there are any tattered copies
of the “Prospector’s Companion” (or was it
“Guide”?) still extant.

his entry. “But they

“Buna”: When a
recent cable from Lon-
don mentioned that an
old objection to the
second verse of the
National Anthem was
being revived in Labor
circles, the “S. M.
Herald” reprinted the
“Thy choicest gifts in
store” verse to refresh
the public mind, caus-
ing its readers to
wonder what on earth
could be wrong with
that innocuous senti-
ment. The selection
was, of course, an
error; the words to
which exception are
taken are the lines be-
ginning “O Lord our
God arise,” with the
at tendant prayer for
the confounding of
enemies’ politics and
the frustration of
their knavish tricks.

“Caballer”: It was the day after the
Armistice, and the mess had been discussing
the previous night’s celebrations. Presently
we were comparing notes on Mafeking night,
those of us who were old enough to remem-
ber it—one had been in Piccadilly, another
had helped to paint Hongkong red, a third
rejoiced exceedingly in Townsville. The old
major smoked on silently. “And where were
you, Major, on Mafeking night?” somebody
asked him at last. “In Mafeking,” was the
answer, which started the Armistice celebra-
tions afresh.
“Old Parr”: Whep anyone dies at an age
well over the century in Australia — 1 a case
occurred the other day, when the deceased
was reputedly 110 or 111 —you are always
apt to read that he or she was born in
Ireland. It would be unsafe to deduce
from this that the Hibernian is longer-lived
than the Sassenach or the Scot; the fact is
that exaggerations are much more likely to
creep in with the Irish-born. Even in Eng-
land and Wales registration of births was
only made compulsory in 1874. It was
general, of course, all over Britain long
before that—Somerset House records go back
to 1887 —but not in Ireland. When old age
pensions became the law of the U.K. in
1908, many Irish would-be pensioners had
trouble in proving they were 70 or
over. In numerous cases there was no
official evidence whatever, so all sorts of
unofficial evidence had to be accepted. It
is much the same with centenarians. No
doubt some are just as old as they claim or
are claimed to be, but it would be mighty
hard to prove it in a court of law.

The distinction “B.B.” draws between “bag-

turn that they don’t mix. As a matter of fact,
the newchnm always values the company and

the latest British precedent. In England
recently a driver was found guilty of negli-
gence because his smooth tyres caused him
to skid into another car. ’Sonah ruled that
as treads are put on tyres to prevent such
an eventuality, it is a culpable thing to
drive without them.

“Dotted Line” : That very learned lawyer
N.S.W. Justice Ferguson, giving the. judg-
ment of the Full Court of Criminal Appeal,
has been telling us how far we may go in
getting you mugs to put your names on the
dotted line. In the first place, I gather, wo
needn’t worry about the price being out-
rageous. It isn’t a crime to sell a man
something for twice
as much as it is worth
—luckily, otherwise
half the lawyers in the
country would be in
gaol long before they
could become Judges.
And we needn’t be
careful of our adjec-
tives, either, so long as
we are careful to con-
fine them to matters of
opinion. We can as-
sure our mug that the
block of land we are
trying to sell has a
glorious view, and we
can picture the pros-
perity that will come
to the district when
a tramway is built: we
may assure him that
in our opinion no Gov-
ernment in the world
would hesitate to build
a tramway to a dis-
trict so lavishly blessed
by nature. We can
tell him of the millions
that have been made
by shrewd buyers anti-
cipating rises in mar-
ket price; we can pic-
ture for him the tor-
ments of a parent who,
having thrown away a
chance like this, pre-
sently finds his wife
famished and his chil-
dren without even the
means to attend a pic-
ture show. All we've
got to be careful about,
I gather, is “specific
representation.” We can let our fancy go
free ; facts are the snags that alone are liable
to wreck our little craft and land us high
and dry in quod.

“Doctor Fell” : Girl? Then the probabilities
are she’ll do all right. Of course girls do die
within the first 24 hours ; but the male has
much better chances of never knowing what
a trade cycle or a labor army is. Where
1000 girls will have a first-birthday party in
Australia only 799 boys *vill do it, though, of
course, the figures vary from year to year.
To those who know how slender is the thread
by which so many of the new-born hang to
life, the amazing thing is that so large a
proportion survive: of 1000 Australian chil-
dren born with any life at all, 948 survive
the first year. A child was born alive in
Sydney this year which weighed under 21b. ;
it lived, and though presently it fell away to
lib. 130 z., its life was still being fought for
when last I heard of it. That is an excep-
tional case; but there are many almost as
startling.
“Cosmop”: Sydney is beginning to re-
semble a man who can’t afford new clothes,
and has got indifferent about his shabby
old ones. Not long ago it was one of the
smartest, most smugly correct cities m the
world, and its inhabitants sneered at
poor old London’s dirt, and destitution. lew
of its houses needed painting. Most of them
were occupied; The gardens were tidy, and
so were the streets. The city fathers even
ran periodical campaigns to stop people drop-
ping tram tickets on the pavements. There
were no beggars, and camouflaged mendi-
cants such as street musicians didn’t dare
to operate. Pavement touts, barrowmen,
gutter vendors of toys, matches, etc., were
sternly moved on or proceeded against and
heavily fined. The idea of a little town of
tents springing up in the Domain would
have been unthinkable. Past week, in the
circumscribed area which I frequent, I
noticed an old lady playing a harmonium
accompanied by a small boy as collector; a
cornet-player; a tin-whistler; a blind man
(“Family to support. Genuine case”) ;
three violinists; a small jazz band of the
wandering type; and a string band-all prac-
tically in the heart of the city. Street music
is still illegal, but the law is falling into
abeyance. From a press report:—
S.M. (to defendant charged with singing in the
streets) : “You’re fined Is. and Bs. costs, in default
the rising of the Court.”
Defendant: “Time to pay, say, seven days?”
Mr. Perry: “It’s the rising of the Court, and
the Court has now risen, so you can go! ”
Not far from the railway station dozens of
small dealers sell things from trays and
barrows, and on Friday nights it is hard to
battle through the Oxford-street touts.
Almost every shop has them, some relying
on their deafening voices to attract atten-
tion, others using cowbells. The suburbs,
particularly the near-in ones, provide an
explanation. Houses and flats empty in
every street (the former tenants having gone
to live with dad or mum, as a rule), win-
dows smashed and gardens gone to ruin, and
unpainted dilapidation steadily extending to
the tenanted dwellings. It has a heart-
breaking suggestion of poor Brummel in exile
in Boulogne.
* * * *
Mrs. (Lieut.-Colonel) Gumboil, 0.C.,
White Feathers Depot, N.S.W. Trades Hall
Labor Army, is troubled in her soul: —
Right glad I was to see the Boy Scouts and Girl
Guides condemned by the chairman of our Educa-
tional Committee at the A.L.P. Conference last
week. “We all know' the character of their organi-
sations,” said Mr. McNamara. “The whole thing
shrieks of militarism, and the Chief Secretary ought
to be ashamed of himself for having so forgotten
the ideals of our movement as to give the Chief
Scout a pat on the back.” Hear! Hear! I have
a nephew (young Artie, aged 10) who has disgraced
the Gumboils (militant Laborites one and all, and
relentless wagers of the class war on behalf of
world brotherhood, holy peace and industrial unrest)
by becoming a Cub. And now there is talk of his
little sister Norma turning Brownie, God help her!
What do they teach our young at their corro-
borees and jamborees? Do they inculcate the eternal
truths of pacifism ? Do they give the children
lessons in bashing scabs or putting the boot into
rats? Never. Is hatred of the master class instilled?
No. Do our little ones acquire even the rudiments
of starting irritation strikes, loafing on the job,
or sabotaging machinery ? No. I had it from young
Artie himself, before his mother told him not to
have anything more to do with my side of the
family (for which I mean to stoush her next time
we meet), that his so-called scoutmasters don’t so
much as have classes in Parliamentary language.
So much for their vaunted training! And neither
Scouts nor Guides seem to know the first thing
about enlisting Labor armies. No one impresses
on the tots’ infant minds such facts as the under-
lying humanity of the Ekaterinburg murders or the
need for stamping out Christianity. In short, their
work is starkly militarist first and last, consisting
as it does of rope-tying, being kind to animals,
holding sing-songs, building toy bridges, doing
strangers good turns, and even worse. At the next
Labor Conference I propose to move a resolution
as follows:
That this Conference is in favor of declaring
the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides illegal on account
of their militaristic tendencies.
If they show reluctance to disband I shall urge
that the Labor Army be fraternally marched against
them, and that they be peacefully exterminated.
THE DIRGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Labor members sought to keep their spirits up
before the meeting of caucus by singing a parody
of a well-known song composed to express their
feelings regarding the defection of Mr. McGrath.”
What strain is this they chant in gloomy
chorus
Where “The Red Flag” would rise and
ring of yore,
Robustly clear, defiantly sonorous?
I fancy that I’ve heard the tune before.
The tones suggest an excommunication
Of someone straying from the proper path.
It is—thanks, brother, for the explana-
tion !
A threnody to meet the situation,
The dirge of Dave McGrath.
They know wliat Caesar knew when in the
liver
He felt the snickersnee of Brutus stab.
They saw the others go with scarce a quiver,
Fenton and Lyons, Guy and Brice and
Gabb,
Content to leave them to electors’ mercies;
But when their David joined the recreant
throng
Their anguished spirits broke in bitter
curses,
They pilloried liis perfidy in verses,
And set his sins to song.
What doughtier champion, what stouter
fellow
Ever aloft the flag of Demos bore,
Fell on the foe with such stentorian bellow
Or held the hustings with so fierce a roar?
Who ever dubbed opponents scheming jobbers,
Or labelled them with such impassioned
vim
Unworthy miscreants and bowelless rob-
bers?. . ..
Hark! while they give it lip, his erstwhile
cobbers.
Their hymn of hate for him.
Hark! ’tis in dudgeon high they lift their
voices.
Unlike the jocund pipe of summer birds,
Their chant depresses rather than rejoices;
Mourning and menace mingle in the words.
’Tis not the song wherewith a babe to dandle,
And hints at an unpleasant aftermath.
There’s something smacks of bell and book
and candle
(And commination) in the way they handle
The dirge of Dave McGrath !

THIS YEAR
If ever it was necessary for the man of limited means to con-
serve carefully and to spend wisely, it is now. In most cases
incomes are lower, and in many outgoing is greater, and conse-
quently reduced margins must be provided for.
True Thrift is not only the hoarding of money—it is just as
much a matter of careful, useful spending; but obviously the
saving must come first.
Open a Commonwealth Savings Account and use it faithfully.
It costs nothing, but will help you to help yourself.

Thirty-four years ago, on March 22, the
National Federal Convention which drafted
the Commonwealth Constitution opened at
Adelaide under the leadership of Edmund
Barton, with C. C. Kingston in the presiden-
tial chair. Of the 50 delegates who attended,
only efght survive: Josiah Symon, K.C., and
Paddy Glynn, K.C., both of S. Aus.; Joe Car-
ruth ers (N.S.W.) ; Isaac Isaacs (now Gov-
Gen.), John Quick, LL.D., and Alex. Pea-
cock, of Vic.; Elliott Lewis (Tas.) ; and
Walter James, K.C. (W.A.). All of them
except Glynn were knighted, and four sat in
the first Federal Parliament.
Bernard Clarence (“Barney”) Olde, who

arrived in 1856, and the eighth native-born
one. The other Australians by birth were
Farnell, Dibbs, Lyne, Carruthers, Wade,
Storey and Fuller. Stuart and Reid were
Scotch; Martin, Jennings, Waddell and
Dooley Irish; Donaldson, Cowper, Parker,
Robertson, Parkes, See, McGowen and Hol-
man English. Forster was born at Madras
and Bavin in Maoriland. Six ex-Premiers—
Waddell, Carruthers, Holman, Dooley, Fuller
and Bavin—are still on deck. Lang is the
first estate-agent to reach the office. John
Storey was the only Premier to die in
harness.
Monsignor O’Haran, who died on Sun-
day _ morning, was the complete eccle-
siastic. He had several loyalties—to Ireland
where he was born 77 years ago, to Aus-
tralia where he had lived for nearly half
a century—but his gifts were devoted chiefly
to furthering the power and glory of the
R. C. Church. A brilliant organiser and
business man, he raised enormous sums for
cue completion of St. Mary’s, and he was
largely responsible for the success of the
R. C. conferences which occurred in Sydney
while he was Administrator at the Cathedral.
He became the late Cardinal Moran’s private
secretary on the recommendation of Leo
XIII. Like the Cardinal, he was an imposing
figure, being over six feet in height and the
possessor of a remarkably gentle and win-
ning _ voice and suave manner. Like the
Cardinal, too, he had a sense of humor, and
he was the staunchest of friends. He had
a few enemies, for his smiling and diplomatic
ways concealed a forceful character and an
unyielding will, but he was loved where he
was best known —in the Sacred Heart
parish, Darlinghurst. He had been in charge
there for the past 19 years, and the Darling-
hurst poor of all denominations applaud his
kindness and generosity.
J. M. Maughan, Chief Commissioner of
the Boy Scout movement in the Ma State,
was born at Ashfield 53 years ago, and, like
his elder brother David, the K.C., went from
The King’s School, Parramatta (where he
was a footballer of note) to Balliol College,
Oxford. Returning to Sydney, he was
admitted a solicitor in 1906. . In the war
he served first in German New Guinea; then
he went to France with the 17th Battalion,
rose to the rank of lieut.-col., and collected
a. D.S.O. at Pozieres. Two years ago he
linked up with the Scout movement, and now
has over 14,000 youngsters looking up to
him.
E. A. McTiernan, appointed a High Court
Judge at 3S, was the baby of the N.S.W.
Assembly when he was returned for Western
Suburbs in 1920, being five months the
junior of his fellow-Laborite Billy McKell,
wdio had beaten ex-Premier Jimmy McGowen
for Redfern three years earlier. For a
while the young men’s careers ran along
parallel courses. McTiernan was Attorney-
General under Storey, Dooley and Lang, and
McKell held the Justice portfolio in the same
Ministries. Lang left them both out of his
second Ministry, the “Scabinet,” and
McT lernan, who took honors at Sydney Uni.
and began as a civil servant, did not stand
rt n ensuing State election; he became
ii?' , o , r * ‘ai'kes in 1929, and mounted
the High Court Bench a year later. McKell,
who was a boilermaker before entering Par-
liament, and who lias lately been admitted
to the Bar, is Lang’s Local Government
Minister.
Old Bulletin contributor Dr. R. S.
Ellery has resigned from the Vic. Lunacy
Department to put up a brass plate m
Coliins-street. Ellery was responsible for
the treatment of general paralysis of the
insane at Mont Park by injections of
malaria. The method, which attracted world-
wide interest, was described in Tile Bulle-
tin some years ago. Ellery is a son of the
one-time town clerk of Adelaide who subse-
quently became Melbourne’s civic secretary.
He is 34 and a Melbourne Uni. graduate.
The late J. M. Chanter did not see much
of Adelaide in later life, but he was born
there 80 years ago, and was among the very
oldest of St. Peter’s College old boys.
T. H. Laby, Professor of Natural Philo-
sophy, is the third Australian to be elected
Fellow of the Royal Society. The others were
Professor Steele (chemistry) and Professor
Mitchell. All three professed at Melbourne
University.
Sir Alfred Robbins, of the “Birmingham
Lost,’ who has died in London, aged 75,
was born and educated in Tasmania. He
left for Fleet-street in his early twenties, and
was an immediate success. He got his
knighthood during the war, chiefly because
he was the most cheery and amiable of men;
lie knew and was liked by literally every-
body of note in official, theatrical and jour-
nalistic London. Nominally a Gladstonian
Liberal, one of the best things he ever wrote
was a monograph on the Lord Salisbury who
was a _ Tory P.M. Masonry—he rose to
vast heights in the order—and talking were
Ins hobbies.
Les Barraud, winner of the Victorian
King’s Prize, is an exception to the general
rule that men who have seen active service
rarely become prominent target-shots. Bar-
raud, who hails from Wagga (N.S.W.), was
m France with the 22nd Battalion, and won
the M.C. for his work with a Lewis gun at
V lllers-Bretonneux.
George Wise, of Sale (Vic.), ex-P.M.G.,
cuts the same figure at an A.N.A. conference
at 78 as he did when he was 36. New dele-
gates vote him to the board of directors as
consistently as ever, and submit just as will-
ingly to his domination. “I refuse to be
bullied,” said George protestingly at one
conference. “That’s rich from you,” drawled
the late Dr. Rinder, “when you’ve been bully-
ing two hundred men for 20 minutes.” Wise
had his way, however, and has never ceased
having it.
Albert Willis, the Ma State’s new Agent-
General, is a native of Abertillery, Mon-
mouthshire. William Davis, Minister for Edu-
cation, and Evan Davies, M.L.A. for Ryde,
hail from the same town.

canvas himself. He has written several his-
tories of painting, turned out monographs on
many painters, published a book on some of
Shakspeare’s sonnets, and is editor of the
old London Water-color Society Club’s
annual volume. He confessed on his arrival
in Melbourne that, although he knew
the work of Bunny, Lambert, Ashton and
Proctor, he had yet to learn what other
Australian artists could do. He is here to
confer with the Felton Bequest committee
and Vic. National Gallery trustees in regard
to policy and plans for future purchases.
“Whitehall”: Ex-Prime Minister Baldwin
has banged the Fleet-street peers to leg again,
and I fancy he will go on doing it as long
as he stays in politics. I used to watch
him in Parliament during the mara-
thon coal strike and puzzle over the
reason of liis ascendancy. He can’t
speak; he reads haltingly from notes which
he usually gets jumbled up. In debate he
was overshadowed by nearly every member
of the Ministry. Often when the strike situ-
ation got awkward he would clear off to Aix-
les-Bains, and leave things to the spectacular
Churchill. He hates fighting, and those Con-
servatives who demand venom and abuse of
the other side in a- leader have for years been
trying to get him shelved. Baldwin goes on
winning because he is, as the .saying goes, a
gentleman. Straight, sincere, devoid of class
feeling, simple in his ways, and without
malice, he provides an edifying contrast to
those who are trying to oust him. Lord
Rothcrmere’s gibe at his poverty during the
St. George’s election was an example of the
way his enemies play into his hands. He is
relatively poor because he gave a large part
of his fortune to the nation 15 years ago as
his war effort; and most readers of Lord
Rothermere’s papers know it.
Captain William Jordan, dead in England
at the ripe age of 95, will be remembered by
many of the older generation of Australians
who sailed in P. and O. ships, of which he was
skipper. The first Australia, the last P. and
O. boat with the old-fashioned clipper bow
and bowsprit, was under his command in the
late ’seventies when she broke her shaft in
the Bay of Biscay with a big passenger list
of Australians and Anglo-Indians. She was
picked up by another steamer, but the tow
parted in a gale, and the Australia dis-
appeared in the darkness. Later she was
found at anchor near the Channel Islands.
James Harnetty, who succeeds C. S.
McPherson as Vic. Public Service Commis-
sioner, joined the State service 30 years
ago. Beginning as a penal branch officer, he
transferred to the Treasury, and rose step
by step to the second-best job of accountant
(£lOOO p.a.). His present billet carries a
salary of £1250 p.a., and it will be more
than six years before he reaches the retiring
age.

The factors mainly responsible for the col-
lapse of profits have been (1) the general
slump in trade, (2) the idleness on the
Maitland coalfield, and (3) heavy invest-
ments in new concerns which, for the most
part, have not sent along any divs. Also
the co. has leant heavily upon outsiders, and,
of course, the weight of the debt has made
itself felt.
The quarter-million of 6 p.c. prefs. called
for all but £3BOl of last year’s net earnings,
wffiich were £57,073 short of the previous
year’s, and £246,663 less than the 1924
figure, from which point the slip began.
So the ords. went hungry for the first time
since the co.’s shipping and coal interests
were passed over to subsidiaries in 1915,
when £1.050,000 of bonus scrip was scat-
tered. A further half-million of similar
paper went out nine years later; paid capi-
tal thus became £2,250,000, including the
prefs. How greatly conditions for the co.
have changed during the decade covered by
the table is illustrated by the fact that aver-
age net profits for the last half of this
period (£133,722) were £105,472 lighter than
for the first half of it.
The co.’s chief source of income has been
the old Howard Smith line, now Australian
Steamships I’ty.; next are its coal interests:

The co. also has a substantial holding in
Australian Sugar (paid capital, £207,915),
which has been a steady 12 p.c. proposition
for the last half-dozen years. No hint is
given as to what the shipping co. pays, but
collier and general freight earnings have
been affected. For the last two years Cale-
donian has passed its div., while Invincible’s
distribution has dropped from 10 p.c. to 5
p.c. The ords. in the Iron and Steel Co. got
5 p.c. in 1929, but went hungry last year.
Both the cement and metal ventures have
been disappointing; Vickers does not broad-
cast its figures.
The next table shows the extent to which
the co. has gone into debt to finance its
investments :—■

Liabilities . . .. 664,333 861,656 1,001,567
Excess liabilities .. £243,622 £573,689 £729,677
Last year the board raised an extra £148,034
on overdraft (£221,586), leant upon sundry
creditors (£667,189) for a further £26,308,
and repaid £34,431 of deposits (£112,792),
Altogether the excess of liabilities over
liquids was £155,988 greater, reaching
£729,677. The book value of share holdings
(£3,090,954) increased £160,106; property
and plant were a trifle lighter at £196,549.
The shipping subsidiary promises to re-
main the. backbone of the business. The
coal trade in N. S. Wales is trying to re-
habilitate itself, but threatened legislative
interference has thrust fresh uncertainties
into the outlook. Slackness in construc-
tion has affected the steel, cement and metal
industries, and the position in respect of
sugar remains uncertain until the result of
the Commonwealth Government’s inquiry is
known.
The market pays Bs. 6d. for the ords.,
which have a net tangible backing of 235.
on paper. The prefs., which are covered
by £lO 14s. 4d. in net tangibles, are well
held.

Capital was kept steady, and, visibly, the
co. put on little fat for the 35 years to the
close of accounts in 1924. Since then
£150,000 of debentures have been repaid out
of savings, to the benefit of capital. Also
£250,000 of bonus scrip has been scattered,
of which £111,455 came from inner reserves,
and the div. has been kept at 10 p.c.
Admitted net earnings for the last five years
averaged £59,949 as against an average of
£41.050 for the preceding quinquennium. And
that despite drought—there were three bad
seasons in succession and in some parts five
in S. Aus.—and other disabilities.
The drought has broken, but general finan-
cial debility has affected spending, reduced
the value of hotel and other properties and
made the problem of bad debts more perplex-
ing. Also there have been stinging increases in
excise and other taxation. Nevertheless, this
well-handled concern’s latest p. and 1. account
shows gatherings (£99,024, including £45,281
of interest and rents) only £378 short of
the previous year’s. ' Meanwhile, “to the
ample provision which already existed for-
bad and doubtful debts a further addition
has been made.” There was little change in
exes. (£38,487), and after paying the div.
and striking £lO,OOO off the book value of
plant, etc., £1784 of the net takings were
visibly ploughed in.
Here is as much as balance-sheet figures tell:

During the year the book value of debtors’
balances shrunk £14,487, and £18,251 more
than was written off was spent on freeholds,
plant, etc. Liabilities, which were reduced
£17,703, include provision for taxation, etc.
-—£44,756 of genuine profit was raked out
of this heap about four years ago. Over the
last seven years £85,599 has been spent out
of earnings on freeholds, plant, etc., and
charged to capital; also £202,693 has been
added to the book value of advances. It is
the way breweries have of ensuring future
turnover. At the moment the future is fuil
of uncertainty; all that can be said defi-
nitely is that this co. is very well equipped
for a struggle.
Over the last 12 months the scrip has
eased from 275. 6d, to 255. on the
market. The return at the lower figure is
8 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis. The visible
hacking amounts to 21s. 3d. in net tangibles.

The board considered “a strong financial
position more important at present than the
rate of dividend”; so, notwithstanding the
continued growth of the business, net earn-
ings were put at £122,181, or £6117 less
than the previous year’s, and a point was
chipped off the ord. div., reducing it to
9 p.c.
The difference between the profit claimed
and that shown in the table represents net
additions to the various reserves. Chief of
these is the renewals, replacement and con-
tingency fund, to which £101,449 was added
during the year, raising it to £709,655.
These reserves are probably accumulations
in excess of current requirements for depre-
ciation, etc. The board admitted as much
about five years ago, when the plant was
claimed to be worth over £200,000 more
than its book value.
Treating the visible additions as profit,
and allowing for the pref. divs. (together
£9950), there was enough to show 1*.3 p.c.
on the ord. capital compared with IS.o,
18.7 and 17.9 p.c. back to 1928. Appear-
ances are, therefore, that a 10 p.c. div.
could have been maintained with ease.
Much, of course, depends upon the efficiency
of the plant, in which respect technical im-
provements, many of them affecting the cost
of production, make the charge for obsoles-
cence heavy . XH-MA
The year s surplus earnings and ill,llo
of fresh capital enabled the board to snip
£5578 off the amount coming to sundry
creditors, and add £93,284 to the book value
of the chief earning assets: —

Subject to the Brisbane Council's statu-
tory right to purchase at various dates, the
co.’s franchises are perpetual. Still, because
the co. operates a public utility, there is
the evergreen possibility of legislative inter-
ference with the div.
The prefs.—2o,ooo 6 per cents, and
125,000 7 per cents. —are preferential as to
dividend only. As for capital they rank
equally with the ords, after deducting re-
served profits. On the market the ords. are
at 235. and the 7 per cents, around par. At
235. the return is 7.8 p.c. on a 9 p.c. div.
basis. The backing for all shares is 30s.

This is another co. operating on the chain-
store principle and selling low-priced miscel-
laneous goods whose business has bounded
ahead, despite generally-depressing condi-
tion. Formed in Sydney in December, 1924, .
the co. spread to Brisbane two and a half
years later. Expanding turnover sent it
to the public for £30,500 of pref. money
towards the close of 1928, and presently a
subsidiary was formed in Perth, and more
branches were opened in Sydney and Bris-
bane. The growth continued, and in 1929
operations were extended to Maoriland,
wdiere another subsidiary was formed, and
yet another was registered during the fol-
lowing year in London to do the foreign
buying for the organisation.
All this, and the purchase of a freel’ld
in Brisbane last year, carried paid capital
to £155,713 in 74,873 prefs. and 83,894 ords.
at Jan. 31; there was £3054 uncalled. For
the 12 months to that date further growth
in turnover is reported, but the effect of
the tariff and of stinging increases in income
and other taxes made themselves felt. Still,
allowing for the pref. div., enough profit was
claimed to show 35.5 p.c.. on average ordi-
nary capital compared with 44.1 p.c. and
33.6 p.c. for the two preceding years. The
div., which had been lifted from 25 p.c. to
30 p.c., was reduced to 20 p.c. But
20 p.c. on recent issues is worth no more than
6.6 p.c., these having been put out at a
premium of £2 per share. A policy which
makes a high rate of dividend inevitable is
an indiscretion, very liable to be misinter-
preted in times like the present. Goodwill
figures at £50,000, but reserves £31.817 in
excess of that had accumulated at the close
of last accounts.
During the year £44,383 of fresh share
capital was gathered. This, the property
purchase and other things show up in the
next comparison of balance-sheet figures:—

The amount coming to trade creditors (now
£45,901, including the bank) was reduced
by £45.932. and £50,000 was added to the
mortgages (£78,000). The reduction of
£22,413 in the stock figures looks healthy
considering that turnover was brisker. Some
Commonwealth bonds, bought during the
term, were lumped with shareholdings, the
net increase in the item being £18,200. Also
the cash holding, here and in London, was
strengthened by £35,002. Excluding shares,
etc., the improvement in the more or less
liquid surplus (£1732) was £7556.
Hitherto the prefs. carried a cumulative
8 p.c. with a 2 p.c. sweetener after the ords.
received 15 p.c.; they are now entitled to
a fixed cumulative 10 p.c. with priority as
to capital, but have no further rights to sur-
plus assets or profits. The backing amounts
to £2 10s. lid. in net tangibles ; last year’s
profit was over eight times their annual
requirements. The market prices the scrip
around par. The ords., which are covered
by 275. 7d. in net tangibles, are not listed.
They fetched 50s. at auction in Brisbane in
Oct. last.

This co., which was formed at the
end of 1927 to manufacture cement by
the wet process, has misse'd the market.
It took up some 430-odd acres of freehold
near Berrima, N. S. Wales, containing
large deposits of limestone, shale, barite and
coal. Some of the freehold was cut up and
sold as business and home sites, the deposits
were opened up, an electric-power plant was
installed and cement works capable of turn-
ing out 150,000 tons per annum were erected
on the spot. To see the job to completion
300,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs. were issued a
little over two years ago and called to 14s.
Thus paid capital became £849,889 in 300,000
prefs. and 639,885 ords. at Oct. 31 last.
Howard Smith and Australian Iron and Steel
each hold 138,299 prefs. and 248,000 ords.,
and Dorman, Long and Co. and Noyes Bros,
are also believed to be interested.
With these connections, and an advantage
over competitors as regards freight to the
Sydney and southern N. S. Wales markets,
ready sales were expected. Production began
in May, 1929, and for the five months to
Oct. 31 a net profit of £9866 was claimed,
of which the pref. div. took £8549. Last year,
owing to the heavy falling off in the demand
for cement, the works were closed down from
time to time as stocks accumulated. After
paying exes, and setting aside something for
taxation, bad debts and depreciation, the
board put the net result at £19,149. That
was £2349 more than the pref. requirements,
but no div. was paid; there is a substantial
overdraft and trade debt calling for reduction.
Here is the position as the published
accounts disclose it: —
1928 1929. 1930.

Book debts .. .. 5,576 56,207 33,550
Cash 241 2,629 236
Last year’s- earnings and a reduction of
£22,657 in book debts enabled the board to
snip £12,032 off the overdraft, £24,068 off
the amount coming to sundry creditors, and
spend £2125 more than was written off on
the main asset. Nevertheless, liabilities ex-
ceeded the more or less liquids, including
stocks, by £268,421 when the books closed;
that was £8624 less than the excess at the
previous balance.
The outlook is not encouraging. The indus-
try is heavily over-capitalised, public expendi-
ture has been cut to the bone and activity in
the construction trades is almost at a stand-
still. In N. S. Wales the position has been made
more acute by industrial legislation, actual
and potential, and the Government is being
urged by some of its supporters to put up
cement works of its own. The annual plant
capacity of the five chief producers in the
State is some 750,000 tons of cement. It is
doubtful whether consumption now amounts
to half that figure. So, assuming the capital
cost of plant to be £5 per ton of capacity, and
that is a fair estimate, no less than £1,875,000
of the capital invested in the industry there
is not earning anything. Until better times
come, this is pretty certain to mean keen
competition and narrow profit rhargins.
The Southern co.’s prefs. carry a fixed
cumulative 8 p.c. and have priority as to
capital. The backing amounts to 5Ss. in net
assets, mainly plant, etc., worth what it can
earn. The main asset includes an unspeci-
fied amount of rights, etc.

Pioneer Wood Tanks, for the storage of any type
of liquid, possess unique advantages over metal
tanks. For instance, they are absolutely non-
corrosive—they are equally efficient for storing water,
wine, the strongest acids or alkalies. They are
simple to erect and will give many years of
thoroughly satisfactory service. Write for full

10 years to the close of accounts in 1925, this
co., which operates in the Nambour district,
decided to do things on a larger scale. So
further substantial additions were made to'
the plant; the board went to its bankers for
the money, and the debt has since over-
shadowed the accounts. At Dec. 31 the over-
draft (£109,503) was still within £B5Bl of
paid capital, which includes £56,199 of bonus
scrip.
Nor was that all. Presently crusliings got
lighter, the juices became refractory and the
export surplus also interfered with earnings.

Last, year’s average c.c.s. (14.4) was the
best yet recorded at the mill, but owing to
the low price for the surplus exported, sales
were £9SBI lighter. So, despite a .saving of
15s. 7d. per ton in manufacturing costs, there
was a loss of £7055 on account of sugar.
And nothing much in the way of profits need
be looked for while the plant, which has a
capacity of 100,000 tons p.a., gets less than
half a meal. The tramway account exactly
balanced again. The loss on the sawmill
was £622, due to maintenance ; it is to re-
main closed until conditions become more
favorable.

earlier. During the year part of the plant
was electrified, and costs benefited.

Maoriland Gold and Australian Mints
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) If a Maoriland gold-producer de-
cided to ship his output to the Royal.
Mint, Melbourne, instead of sending it to
London, approximately how much would he
gain per ounce? (2) In forwarding gold to
the Royal Mint, Melbourne, what is the
correct procedure to adopt as regards pack-
ing, safe keeping and notification of
dispatch? (3) What would the cost of freight
and insurance be? (4) How long after
receipt of gold in Melbourne would he
receive payment? (5) How much gold has
been shipped from Maoriland to Melbourne?
(6) Any other helpful information? —2391.
(1) The advantage will depend on the
exchange quotation for transfer from Mel-
bourne to Maoriland of the amount of the
Mint cheque. The exchange selling rate,
Melbourne on M.L. for purely business
transactions, is at £5 per £lOO. For other
transactions the exchange rate is quoted as
high as £llB 12s. 6d. Consignments of gold
are reaching Melbourne from M.L., and the
advantage to the producer in M.L. is about
5 p.c. (ss. per oz.). This is obtained when
the rate charged for remitting funds from
Melbourne to M.L. is 14| p.c. No forward
quotations are obtainable for exchange.
Deputy Master of Mint, Melbourne, will be
pleased to supply further information on
this subject by correspondence. (2) Gold
should! be forwarded securely packed in
boxes or sewn up in strong canvas. It
may be consigned by boat or through post.
Up to 111 b. in weight is accepted by post.
Parcels up to lOOoz. in weight reach the
Mint by post daily. Gold thus transmitted
should be covered by a policy with some
insurance co. Gold forwarded through the post
is usually sewn up in a strong double-canvas
wrapper,’ and should be registered. Mint
should be advised by a separate letter stating
amount of gold forwarded and also how pay-
ment is desired —whether by cheque, bank
draft or by payment into a particular bank
for transfer to M.L. (3) Freight charges
for gold bullion or alluvial shipped from
M.L. ports to Melbourne is 3d. per ounce by
boat. By post the charge would be 2d.
per ounce plus registration fee. (4) Payment
is usually made about 10 days after gold
arrives at Mint. Payment can be obtained
three days after lodgment by payment of
interest at 7 p.c. p.a. for each day of early
accommodation. (5) 42,9190 z. gross of gold
was sent to Melbourne Mint from M.L. last
year. It is expected this amount will be
considerably exceeded this year, owing to
the prevailing premium on gold now in force
in Australia. (6) The rate of premium now
payable on gold in Australia is fixed by
the Commonwealth Bank at the ruling tele-
graphic transfer selling rate, Australia on
London, less the estimated costs of remit-
ting gold to London, at present about 255.
p.c. In accordance with this arrangement
the price paid by the Mint works out as
follows: —
loz. sovereign (or standard) gold of 22-24
carat fineness —normal Mint price . . £3 17 10}
Present premium at £29 ss. per cent. 12 8}
Total price per ounce of 22 carat fineness £5 0 7
Gold of higher or lower fineness is paid for
at proportional rates according to assay.
The Mother Lode at Ravenswood (N.Q.)
is still in the public eye. The collapse of
the Whitworth option gave a North Queens-
land syndicate the chance to get in, and
they have prepared plans and specifications
of workings and assay results. The tests
so far show a big body, estimated to contain
several million tons of 'stone averaging about
Odwt. gold. The body is a huge hill of
mineralised granite, volcanic intrusions hav-
ing evidently enriched a wide zone of the
country rock. Enough work has been done
to interest bigger capital, it is thought. If
this is secured, the first cut should be de-
voted to systematic core drilling of the hill.
It is the type of deposit that calls aloud
for drilling.
While these developments are proceeding
it is a pity to learn that last week the Rail-
way Commissioner decided to pull up the
rails to Ravenswood. It would do no harm
to delay the job until present negotiations
are completed or fizzle out.

The Palmer River Gold Co., which got its
dredge working at the end of December, has
cleaned up gold worth £lOO4 for 43
days’ actual work ; for the last 20 of them
98-}oz. valued at £520 were recovered. The
standard mint price for the first five bars
averaged £4 Is. 9d. per ounce. The
exchange premium increased the aver-
age gross return to the co. to £5
ss. 7%d. Costs are not stated. Freshes
in the river, removal of timber from the face
and minor mechanical troubles interfered
with running time. The dredge is now work-
ing on a rough gravel face 300 ft. wide at
an average depth of 17ft.; bottom is soft
granite. Thus far a large percentage of the
fines has escaped. This is due to heavy
grey sand, which clogs the nipples and allows
the fine gold to flow over the top. The
remedy, says general-manager Baker, is to
instal either shaking tables or jigs. If these
are successful it is expected that the weekly
returns will be doubled.

Goldmines of Australia is pushing ahead
with the prospecting of its Mt. Coolan (Q.)
leases, despite shortage of water. About 50
men are employed, mostly underground, work-
ing three shifts. On Barclay’s lease three
shafts are going down, two on the lode and
one main haulage shaft off the lode. One
shaft on the Coolon lease has been deepened
from 140 ft. to 200 ft., and another on the
Native Bear has gone down from 100 ft. to
300 ft., and has cut the reef, which is being
driven upon. The same reef was cut higher
up in yet another shaft. There it was 25ft.
thick and worth between £8 and £9 a ton.
The dip was about 70 degrees.

Carpathia Tin, near Ardlethan (N.S.W.).
reports a loss of £421 for the half-year to
January 31. The co. received £464 as its
share of the proceeds of a surface clean-up
by E. W. O’Brien. He has now been granted
a six months’ tribute to work underground.
Paid up capital is £45,424. Creditors figured
at £717; liquid and semi-liquid assets at
£2876. Alterations to facilitate cheaper
working have been introduced by the tribu-
tor at small cost to the co., which expects
to benefit when it takes over again.

Longreach Oil Wells is offering the re-
mainder of its unissued capital—s4,ooo
shares at 10s. each. The well is to be “shot”
in hope of opening up the oil sands. If this
is a miss the casing is to be withdrawn and
test bores put in hand, supplemented by
scout drilling. After that a bore will be
put down, if results warrant it. Arrange-
ments have been made with Oriomo Oil,
which holds a debenture over the co.’s Long-
reach assets, to suspend its rights for a couple
of months. If at the end of that time share-
holders have not coughed up enough to
cover the cost of the proposed operations, no
allotment will be made and the money
received will be returned to the senders.

Westralian Chamber of Mines, which has
clamored for years for a reduction in wages,
got a shock the other day when two Yankee
members, Thorn of the Lake View and Prior
of Wiluna, announced that they would not
take advantage of the Bs. a week reduction
in the basic wage ordered by the State Arbi-
tration Court. Both declared that what
they wanted was not lower wages but in-
creased efficiency.

Westralian shareholders in the Mararoa are
wondering when the Londoners who recently
took an option on the co.’s Reedy’s gold-
mines are going to make a start. The pro-
perty was drilled and reported to contain
over 160,000 tons of ore that would show
a profit on treatment of 10s. a share; neither
premium nor bonus was dreamt of at the
time. It was then optioned to H. E. Vail
on London account, and over £BOOO was
called up from shareholders to clear off
liabilities. After delay this option was turned
down, not because Vail had changed his
opinion regarding the value of the mines,
but because of the state of the London money
market,
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
What bonus did the M.L.C. declare on a
whole-life policy for the 35 th year of its
participation in 1929? Which section of the
policy-holders received this bonus, the Citi-
zens’, A.W.F., or M.L.A., and what were the
bonuses allotted to those sections which
didn’t received the bonus referred to above? —
2114.
On whole-life policies, £3 18s. p.c. of sum
assured ; on endowment assurances, maturing
at ages 60 and over, £3 p.c. On endowment,
assurance policies maturing at ages under
60, £2 10s. p.c. To policies which had been
35 years in force the bonuses were £4 4s.
p.c. for whole life, £3 p.c. for endowments
maturing at 60 or over, and £3 p.c. for
ditto under 60. On policies issued origin-
ally by the M.L.A. and the Widows’ Fund
the bonus took the form of a compound
reversionary bonus of £3 ss. p.c. calculated
on sum assured and total existing bonuses.
This applied to all such policies irrespective
of their duration.
Which class of life office should show Us
policy-holders the best results under our
changed conditions? What exactly is the
difference between mutual and other offices?
—2424.
A purely mutual office is one without
shareholders or share capital. All its profits
therefore belong to policy-holders. But out-
side the premiums of policy-holders there is
no capital to guarantee payments on poli-
cies. In a proprietary office there are share-
holders financially interested in getting
results for themselves and the policy-holders
(they usually divide them four-fifths to policy-
holders, one-fifth to shareholders) ; and there
is share capital to guarantee the promised
payments to policy-holders as far as that
share capital will go. In theory a pro-
prietary office should offer the better security,
because of its share capital; in practice
the mutual office often offers larger security
because its reserves for contingencies exceed
the capital and reserves of the proprietary
office.
Would the English banks with branches in
Australia be affected by inflation here?
Would I better secure myself by opening an
account with one of them in London, prefer-
ably one with branches in S. Africa? —2341.
Three of the banks doing business in Aus-
tralia have their head offices in London. None
of them have S. African branches. All have
most of their assets in Australia and Maori-
land. The largest of them, the Australasia,
for example, had at the date of its last
balance-sheet to hand (Oct. ’29) total assets
of 49 millions ; and the sworn averages for
the first quarter of 1930 showed that it had
in Australia and M.L. 35 millions in advances
and securities, two millions in coin and bul-
lion and four millions in legal tender notes
—total 41 millions of the total of 49 millions,
leaving less than eight millions to be repre-
sented by all other assets everywhere, includ-
ing premises in Australia and M.L., and legal
tender and securities in Britain. Apparently
inflation would hurt the English banks doing
business in Australia quite as badly as it
would the banks with Australian head
offices.
(1) Does the N.S.W. Government assist
experienced prospectors? (2) To what ex-
tent? (3) The Bulletin has recommended
the Abercrombie Ranges (N.S.W.) as a likely
place to find gold. Is that alluvial or reel?
—1930.
(1) and (2) For many years past aid
has been granted on approved sites to which
a valid mining title is held, to sink, drive,
etc., at rates per foot equivalent to actual
half-cost of carrying out the work. Recently
a scheme was initiated whereby prospectors
were granted a rations allowance of £1 per
week. The funds available at present, how-
ever, have been fully allotted, but any appli-
cation submitted to the department will be
noted. (3) Both.
(1) Market value of white clay? (2)
- Where can one find a market ? —2097.
(1) From 30s. per ton to £6 or more,
depending upon suitability for particular
purposes. Many are of little, if any, value.
High-grade pottery clays should be white
after being through a temperature of
lOOOdeg. C. to 1200 deg. C. (2) Manufac-
turers of pottery and kalsomine are the
principal users. Samples should be sub-
mitted to such firms.
(1) Did anything come of the visit of a
German chemist to inquire into the ores
produced by Radium and Rare Earths Treat-
ment Co.? (2) What is the position of Aus-
tralian Radium Gorp. ? —2035.
(1) He was engaged to test the ores for
the production of titanium white, and
reported adversely—expense too great. (2)
Owing to the Hatry crash in October, 1929,
all negotiations for placing the property m
the London market were suspended, and
nothing practical has been done since. There
is still a prospect of the business being
revived in the near future, as Mr. Bowler,
has returned to London and has interested
himself in the matter. A cable has been
received from him indicating there is a pos-
sibility of a co. on smaller lines taking on
the proposition. He also advises that Aus-
tralian affairs are in very bad odor owing
to the present political situation in the
Commonwealth, which is making it very dilli-
cult to do business; otherwise he considers
English capital would flow into Australia.
(1) Sydney address of the Australian
and N. Z. Banking Corporation? (2)_ Has
it decided when it will commence business?
—2179.
(1) The co. is now in its own premises,
Stanton House, Pitt-street, Sydney. (2) No.
In the quarterly reports of a London co.
with a mine at Kalgoorlie, I _ read “Esti-
mated net exchange premium £3356.” What
does it mean? —2356.
Gold is exported, and sold for English
money; and £lOO English is worth £l3O 10s.
Australian. The Perth Mint, paying in Aus-
tralian money, therefore hands over £l3O 10s.
for gold that will make 100 sovereigns—less
255. cost of shipping 100 sovs. to London.
Any market in N.S.W. for asbestos ( long
fibre) ? Probable prices? —2oo7.
Certain grades are marketable. Price
from a few pounds to over £lOO per ton,
according to strength and length.

The Boys Go By
Last week Sydney got up out of the dust
and shook herself. She went gay. She
cavorted, flirted, preened. She pigrooted
and burst the surcingle—and the leaden
leaders of Labor, the nagging nabobs of
Nationalism, the paid pipers of the press,
“They are coming on, small troop after
troop of them.”
and all the other dull dogs of depression
were huddled in the ditch. In their places
she set up :
(1) “The First Mrs. Flraser„” at the
Criterion;
(2) “And So to Bed,” at the Savoy;
(3) “Fine and Dandy,” at the Opera
House;
(4) Clara Butt trilling at the Town Hall;
(5) Wirths’ elephants, ditto at the
Glaciarium;
(G) “Topsy Turvy” (with much bald
woman), at the St. James ;
(7) “Dearest Enemy” (see Dot Brunton
wearing nothing but a slippery cask!), at
Her Majesty’s;
(8) The Strange Case of John Priora
and Three Others 'v. Grand Opera Excerpts,
at the State;
(9) Duncan Macdougall in “Viennese
Tights,” at the Playbox;
(10) Bottom the Weaver (and an audi-
ence of throw-down heavers), at .the Savoy ;
and
(11) Stalls, wheels, sideshows, monkey
speedway, housie'housie, six aerial salutes,
40 weeping and colored electric shells, pris-
matic Romans, gold and silver fountains,
Girandole rockets, the gigantic multicolored
national emblem, the kangaroo cyclist—
in other words, the annual carnival at
Manly.
This Showman did not see many of these
entertainments. In fact, because most of
them happened on the one date, he saw very
few of them. But he went one better —saw
a show which, at any rate while he was
standing watching it, seemed to leave them
all cold. And that show was merely a
march-past of Boy Scouts viewed from a
grassy hillock in Bridge-street.
It happened on Friday. For several days
previous you could smell in the air that some-
thing big was going to break. You couldn’t
turn a street corner without seeing a party
of boys with their Scout glad-rags on. They
had pitched their tents in several leading
shop-windows. You’d see one of them squat-
ting intently there, holding back the edge
of canvas with a brown paw, and gazing
out with a steadfast searching look that
converted the straining, perspiring, brain-
lessly grouped and staring mass on the pave-
ment outside the window into a jungle alive
with regent-birds and wongas and backward-
peering paddymelons and the rest of the bush
brethren. He was not looking at any drab
city herd, that fellow. He was looking
through it —with the vision of youth that
maybe in time the city, with its ledgers and
desks, with its grind and roaring, will crush
out of him.
Turn the corner, and you’d meet a fellow
upon whom all the blasts of the city had
stormed in vain. He would be 40, or
maybe 50; with glasses, and very lank shins
and knobby knees; but he would be wearing
the same sort of Scout glad-rags; striding
through the crowd with the cocksureness of
a boy' and the pride of a brewery horse.
Down by the Quay you’d run into the boys
who’d come in from the bush to see Baden
Powell. They were not noticeably branded
“bush.” If you didn’t find time in the rush
for work and the other rush home to stop and
watch for a while, you wouldn’t detect any
difference at all between them and the others
you’d met, all going somewhere or other,
further up town. But watch them, and
you’d see that they were all intently
busy—wolfing meat-pies! You could tell
by their attack where they came from.
To Watch four of those Wolf Cubs wolfing
pies was a sight for the pagan gods. They did
not chew them —they bit ’em! They bared
their fangs and went to it! They puffed
on the job and blew bits of piecrust in flaky
showers to the footpath. Fat little boys,
thin little boys, freckled boys, boys with white
hair turning up like duck’s-tails under the
peaks of their caps—all sorts of small boys,
come by a short cut to Heaven, to the para-
dise where meat-pies are plentiful and cheap.
You saw them all again in the march-past.
There they not only had on their glad-rags;
they had up their flags and their totem-
poles. Their flags appear to have been, pat-
terned on a dream of Ulster lying down in
the fold with Cork. The coior is yellow
and green, mostly. On the peak of each
flagpole there is a metal wolf with an arrest-
ing air of meaning business. The wolf’s
heads on top of the totem-poles look like
trophies of the hunt; the sort of things you
see lying about in a dump of panto, props.
So they go by. They march, but at ease.
Here and there is a little cove with his
back as straight as a sergeant-major’s. Per-
haps his mother or his. aunt or somebody has
told him she’d be waiting hereabout. With
him march sm&ll chaps less conscious of
themselves, laughing little coves, pocket
editions of Gcllert’s jester of the trench
(“And with his untold fun, half-leaning on
his gun, they left him—dead.”) ; but tiiese
know nothing about that. You look away
up Bridge-street. They are coming on, small
troop after troop of them, dwarfed in the
drab avenue of almost wholly silent adults
and the canal with high brick walls—a new
parade of the Lilliputians. Some of them
carry the place-marks of the troops; names
that make Swift’s sound very cold—Bogga-
bri, Grenfell, Queanbeyan, Balliua, Bourke,
Woollahra-Paddington ! You don’t know any
of the bush boys—it’s too long now since
you went city. But you fancy there are
one or two men out there who won’t be dead
while one or two of these who have just
gone by are alive.
You suddenly discover that you are stand-
ing beside a middle-aged man who in himself is
a show more authentic, more dramatic, more
real than most of the seemingly more impos-
ing ones listed above. He has got a tight
grip on his bottom lip, as if there was some-
thing nagging at him inside. The deeper
thudding of the drums that come along at
intervals seems to work on him violently. His
face twitches. He tries to beat whatever is
troubling him by giving four or five nervous
claps every now and then. He claps when
a girl in khaki appears surprisingly in
the midst of the passing boys. He claps
when some lads in sailor rig-outs come
abreast. He claps a boy with one leg, who
is marching with the aid of a crutch. He
claps a lad whose left leg is withering away;
and again, a party of blind boys,- marching
hand in hand, with sighted ones linked here and
there among them. At last something comes
which beats him. It is a party of three or
four little coves with their ordinary street
knockabout-sort of clothes on. Perhaps they
have left their bits of jobs about the streets
—the march and the drums, the color and
the magic of it too much for them. Anyway,
they seem to be too much for him. He turns
and strides into a six-storey building.
And quite likely he was probably only
thinking of an overdraft, or mapping out
the speech he is going to make to-night
upon psychological aspects of the depres-
sion ! Maybe it was you and not he who
had been feeling the things you had written
to his account....
It takes some circling to get from Bridge-
street up to Burdekin House in Macquarie-
street, where Baden-Powell is to take the
salute. But by tearing through you get
there as the last columns are trooping by;
in time to hear the crowd making its old
clamor for a speech, speech, though it only
ever wants one speech and mostly doesn’t
want even that. You see Baden-Powell him-
self—the chap who actually thought of those
wolf’s heads on sticks and the rest of
the elegant paraphernalia. He comes out
on to the balcony and holds up his hand.
“A speech?” he says, in a voice that would
reach three times across the harbor. “I
don’t make speeches.” (Loud cheers.) “All
I have to tell you has just passed by.”
And the show is over.

“The First Mrs. Fraser,” the St. John
Ervine comedy at Sydney Criterion, is a
bright, brittle, clever three acts. The crafts-
manship is as sharp as a Darlinghurst
retort. Looking back on it, it is the author’s
cleverness that dominates. That is not the
highest sort of compliment that can be paid
to a playwright, but some of the edge is
taken off it by the fact that with his clever-
ness he presents a piece of life that could
not very well have been given without it.
A shade more seriousness on either the
author’s or the actors’ part and the play
could have been ruinously improbable.
The plot is of the very-bright-idea variety.
Fraser, a hard, sharp, obtuse Scot, leaves
“The cocksureness of a boy
and the pride of a brewery
horse.”
his wife after
a married life
of 25 years to
marry a girl
of 24. Five
years later a
better catch,
in the shape
of a nitwit
boy - lord,
swims into
this young
lady’s ken.
She suggests
to Fraser that
he should let
her divorce
him, and
Fraser, quite
the wrong
type to have
ever left his
first wife for
more than a
month or two
without want-
ing to have
her about
playing up to
his dour ego-
tism, goes
back to the
first Mrs. Fraser for advice. She still
loves him enough to be inclined to take
him back with scarcely mixed gratitude.
An obstacle is that he doesn’t want to figure
in another divorce as the respondent. The
two sons of the first marriage want the
divorce, but for different reasons—the elder,
Murdo, in whom a modern public-school edu-
cation hasn’t wiped out respect for family
life, wants to see his mother and father mar-
ried again; the other, Ninian, loves his
mother enough to detest his father and hate
the second Mrs. Fraser, and wouldn’t mind
seeing both objects of his scorn smeared with
divorce-court mud. Murdo’s wife wants the
divorce because Murdo does, and because she
would want whatever her mother-in-law
wanted. The Fraser maid wants it because
she respects the master. The second Mrs.
Fraser of course wants it. An added reason
is that she has a fancy-man with whom she
will be able to carry on more easily when the
boy-lord is her husband. The boy-lord and
the fancy-man, who don’t put in an appear-
ance, may also be said to want it; indeed,
everybody wants it bar an old worshipper
of the first Mrs. Fraser, and no one, not
even Ninian, wants him.
Out of that complexity the playwright works
his way to a natural end, with the second
lot of wedding bells for the first lot of
Frasers just round the corner. Add that
the piece fairly glitters with wit; that, save
for some well-contrived tense moments here
and there, the audience lives between smiling
and outright laughter all through, and it. is
no way surprising that the play is proving
a winner. The Criterion has had a remark-
ably long run of tip-top entertainers ; it is
the one reasonably safe address in Sydney
for anyone in search of combined good acting
and good plays; and “The First Mrs.
Fraser,” in both respects, ranks among its
best. The piece is not without flaws in
both, but on the whole it is sufficiently good
to warrant postponing whatever the Devil's
Advocate wants to say about it until next
week. Its people are Ethel Morrison, J. B.
Rowe, Roger Barry, John Wood, Mary Mac-
gregor, Leslie Victor, Noel Boyd and Eileen
Morris.
The very first note emitted by Dame Clara
Butt makes an audience sit up and take
notice. She is not only a great contralto,
but the contralto of her age; in reso-
nance and range her voice transcends all
others of its class. She sang to a well-filled
Sydney Town Hall on Saturday night with
all the sweetness and dignity of yore, though
lameness constrained her to remain seated
while delivering most of her numbers. Pos-
sibly it was a coincidence, but it struck
many members of the audience that a tri-
bute to Melba’s memory was intended by
the inclusion in the programme of O’Hara’s
“There Is No Death” (accompanied by
organ, violin, ’cello and pianoforte), Haydn’s
“Spirit’s Song” and Liddle’s setting of “Abide
with Me.” The depths of tragedy were
plumbed in the most moving solo from
Gluck’s “Alceste,” and the spice of variety
was added in Landon Ronald’s set-
ting of “O Lovely Night,” Burleigh’s
transcription of a “Deep River,” and a
“He claps when a girl in khaki appears.”
dainty little Japanese song. Consort Rum-
ford’s nice baritone was heard to best advan-
tage in the golden liquidity of Handel’s
“Where’er You Walk” and in the popular
vocal version . of Stevenson’s “Requiem.”
Ernest Truman, as agile as ever, dashed
through the mazes of Bach’s D minor Toc-
cata and Fugue.
Clara Butt and Kennerley Rumford gave
two concerts at Brisbane City Hall before
heading south. The Butt was in very good
form, but Rumford has done better. Cecily
Murray proved a gifted accompanist. George
Sampson’s organ was rather too evident in
some numbers. In fact, when Clara Butt had
the whole audience singing “Hand of Hope
and Glory” the organ drowned the lot, and
instructions had to be passed along to ease
down. Brisbane is promised Hislop, the
Cherniavsky Trio, Peter Dawson and Ham-
bourg for the current season, and if the
attendance during the Butt-Rumford concerts
is a fair guide there should be a hearty rattle
in the cash boxes.

Wirths’ Circus, at the Glaciarium, has
easily the best stand present writer has
ever seen it in.. That building is perfect for
the circus purpose—even better than the
tent. It is vast and roomy and brilliantly
lighted. Which may be why the performance
seemed better than ever. Just now Wirths
are concentrating on horse acts, and have
one capital new offering in that kind—haif
a dozen Cossacks who can ride like furies.
In their several generations Wirths have
turned on some of the very best things pos-
sible in their line, and one act in this Cos-
sack turn can be rated among those bests.
The show all through is a ding-dong enter-
tainment, summed up in the criticism of
one small boy, who spoke out as soon as
“God Save” was turned on. He said : “Will
you bring me again to-morrow?”

“Yellow Sands,” presented by the Gregan
McMahons for five nights at Melbourne
Comedy, is an English village tale by Eden
and Adelaide Phillpotts. It concerns an
invalid old lady (Beatrice Day), of whom all
the rest of the cast have expectations. She
likes the color red and has a hankering after
the most wayward of her relatives, a nephew
(John O’Connell), who, having no property
of his own, is of the opinion that all pro-
perty is theft. When the old lady dies it
turns out that she has left the bulk of the
property to the Bolshevik. After a titanic
struggle with his conscience he decides to
accept the legacy in trust for humanity, addi-
tional inducement being- the deceased’s help,
Ruth Conabere.
The authors presumably went for their title
to Shakspeare’s loveliest lyric. If so_, they
have reca'ptured quite a lot of the spirit of
instinctive gaiety of those verses. The large
dull foot of political satire never treads too
heavily on the jolly study of human foibles.
The McMahonit.es handled it intelligently and
lightly. Miss Day was too youthful an octo-
genarian even for these days of synthetic
heauty; Gregan McMahon made a breezy
sketch of Richard Varwell, a gent, with a
profound philosophy of beer; Charles Lang-
ley took a serious view of his * duties as
“I don’t make speeches.”
Arthur Yarwell; Ruth Conabere and Fred-
erick Drew gave different varieties but equal
quantities of sympathetic understanding to
the parts of a domestic and a sea captain
respectively, and Betty Rae and Phyllis
Vaughan, as twins, were two concessions to
the alleged demand for low comedy. “Yellow
Sands” was to be replaced by Galsworthy’s
“The Roof” last night and for the four nights
following.
Between forty and fifty thousand people
trampled down Director Rae’s flower-beds at
Melbourne Botanical Gardens in order to
take part in the musical tribute to the late
Dame Nellie Melba organised by Fritz ITart
under Sidney Myer’s auspices. The crowd
vras so vast that a full half of it could have
heard little of the playing and the singing,
and some of it heard nothing but the distant
beating of a drum. The most musical part
of the' programme was the “Unfinished”
Symphony, exquisitely played —too exquis-
itely for out-of-doors acoustics. Followed
some happy excerpts from some of Melba’s
favorite operas, including “Manon.” Massed
choirs sang “Lead, Kindly Light,” and “Abide
with Me,” to which an aviator giving five-
shilling joyrides added the obligato of his
propeller blades. The ideal musical In
Memoriam to Melba has not yet been given.

“Wanted, a Wife” was presented by the
Prosperity Players at-the Bijou, Melbourne,
last week in aid of unemployment relief.
Val Petty, John Muir, Alice Patterson, Peggy
Rogers and others interpreted the comedy.
It is customary to say nothing that isn’t
polite about charity performances, but an
entertainment such as the Perspiratory
Players provided is likely to make any
charitable citizen who had the misfortune to
see it swear an oath, sealed in blood on a
skull in a graveyard at midnight on the
13th of the month while the moon is in a
fit, that he would never attend an amateur
performance again; and that would be bad
for the unemployment-relief funds. The
show started at 8.30 and was over by 10.10
and there were two 20-minute intervals.
These facts ought to he mentioned in
its favor. Also the programme was anno-
tated by a breezy and unexpected individual
with a future as a humorist before him.

Principal features of a recital given at
Sydney Con. Hall by Isidor Goodman, the
Con.’s high priest of the pianoforte, were a
fine delivery of Schumann’s “Etudes Sym-
phoniques” and dainty playing of a suite of
small pieces by Gabriel Grovlez. The latter,
not heard in Sydney before, should become
best-sellers for a week or two —if purchas-
able. In the “Appassionata” Sonata Mr.
Goodman was just a leetle overweighted, but
he played a group of Chopin numbers, includ-
“A sight . for the pagan gods.”
ing the C sharp Scherzo, very gracefully. A
concert transcription of Strauss’s ‘•Blue
Danube” waltzes, which wound up the pro-
gramme, was guiltily enjoyed by many earnest
students.

Uni. Con. lias revived “Maritana” at Adel-
aide Royal, with Winsloe Hall conducting,
and his wife, Madame Delmar Hall, bringing
her experience as a Maritana of former days
to assist Harold Denton, producer. John
Jonas as Don Caesar went through the week
with acting at least equal to his singing, a
rare thing in this class of production. The
rest of the cast was duplicated, Alison Lane
and Beryl Kekwick alternating in the lead.


TRICKY SHOOTING.
“Mr. Lang has brought in a bill to reduce interest. He is, however, faced with the difficulty that more than one-half of the deposits and other savings in Australia
are owned by working-class investors.”
THE O.C.: “Open fire—and Heaven help you if you hit anyone but a capitalist!”
BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
Interest on Mortgages
Dear Bulletin, —The following seems a
way to provide equality of sacrifice in the
case of existing mortgages and other fixed
securities, in N. S. Wales, at any rate.
Amend the Moratorium Act to permit mort-
gagors to apply to the Court for a reduction
of interest up to 25 per cent, of the agreed
rate in the mortgage or security, according
to the varying circumstances of each parti-
cular case. As rents have fallen at least
20 per cent, to 30 per cent, and in some
cases more, while incomes from farming and
grazing properties have fallen 50 per cent,
and more, no one could reasonably object
to such an amendment. Such an Act would
be limited, as in the case of the existing
Moratorium Act, to, say, two years or
further order of the Court.—Yours faith-
fully, Gent One.
Megalomania
Dear Bulletin; —As a native-born though
travelled physician, practising among my
countrymen for the last 22 years, I feel con-
vinced that most of our troubles of to-day
are due to a mental state not germane to
our^ racial stock, but acquired insidiously.
No trace of megalomania could be found
in the mentality of our people as a whole
before the crash of ’92-93. To the great
majority “skite” in any form was anathema.
It was our native sense of proportion which
enabled us to work out our salvation from
that catastrophe, if not “in fear and trembl-
ing,” at least with commendable dispatch.
From then onwards to the historic year 1914
we remained a people imbued mainly with
the desire to preserve the ideals of justice;
service, fair exchange and no robbery—all
the “cottage virtues,” in fact, which had
made our racial stock respected among the
peoples of the earth.
Came then the rivalry and advantage-
seeking of the World War. As the youngest
participant we were almost bound to be
the most susceptible to its influences. The
avalanche of self-seeking let loose could not
fail to overwhelm nations even more mature
than our own, despite the myriad examples
of individual bravery, self-sacrifice and en-
durance displayed in that Armageddon.
We emerged from the contest suspicious
and megalomaniac. In short, nationally and
individually we came to “have tickets on
ourselves.”
Megalomania is merely the scientific jargon
for “swelled head,” or “being too big for
pne’s boots,” and extravagance, national and
individual, is but a natural corollary of such
a frame of mind.
Might I suggest that, before it is too late,
we free ourselves from these evils of crowd-
psychology? From press, pulpit, soap-box,
dais and schoolmaster’s desk, let the clarion
voice of indisputable truth ring out. pro-
claiming that
(1) We are a baby nation of but 6,000,000-odd
inhabitants.
(2) We can’t dictate to the world.
(3) We are not necessarily the best, the bravest,
the cleverest, etc., people on earth.
(4) Our natural resources are bounded.
(5) A man’s only as good as himself.
(6) Land is only worth what it can be per-
suaded to produce.
It is only when we have forsaken a form
of self-hypnosis that we will be persuaded—
we might yet be bludgeoned—into recognising
that this is not a depression that exists at
all. It is the normal state that has returned.
All else was boost, and the bubble has burst.
With a few essential readjustments of our
ideas on the value of land and labor and
of our estimate of legitimate profit, we shall
live as well as if not better than our fore-
bears did when wheat was Is. 6d. a bushel
and potential Shylocks were not found on
every bush.—Yours etc., S. N. It.
Road Competition with Rail
Dear Bulletin, —Between Melbourne and
my home in Riverina (N.S.W.) we pass
hundreds of motor-lorries making use of a
perfect highway, and carrying the cream of
the traffic which should be on the trains run-
ning alongside. Yet in most cases the pri-
mary producer has to drag his produce over
tracks that in winter are bogholes, and in
summer are covered with loose sand and
dust. Therefore I propose
(1) The stoppage of all developmental work on
roads running parallel to existing railways.
(2) The stoppage of all maintenance work on
existing roads running parallel to railways.
(3) The application of all money thus saved to
the metalling of roads running from railway stations
through the heaviest producing areas.
In four or five years the existing parallel
roads would have fallen into a state of dis-
repair—and the railways would come into
tlieir own.
I am strongly against legislation tending
to drive the motor-lorry off the road. Under
my scheme there would be an increased
demand for motor transport as a feeder to
the railway.—Yours, Saffron.
“Ungrateful England”
Dear Bulletin, —My diagnosis of Aus-
tralia’s present ills is that she over-indulged
in a war for a country that has been every-
thing but over-indulgent in return. Scullin’s
empty trade-preference bag tells this. That
war cost us 60,000 men and 687 millions.
Cui iono f Britain turns her blind eye to
this. That eye she also turns to the Soviet’s
repudiation of a debt of 390 millions, where-
fore she still trades enormously with Russia,
to the detriment of our wheatgrowers. Add
Britain’s guarantee to the Argentine to take
eight millions’ worth of her primary pro-
ducts, and you need not wonder why wheat-
farmers in W.A., S.A., Victoria and N. S.
Wales owe storekeepers six million pounds,
nor why 32 storekeepers in the Riverina are
chewing over where the million-odd they are
owed is coming from.
My suggestion is that Australia should,
instead of looking for trade preferences that
ungrateful England is unwilling to give, turn
her face towards Eastern Asia, where there
are outlets for her production amongst teem-
ing millions. The advance of China and
Japan to civilisation is Australia’s oppor-
tunity. They want our boots, hats, articles
of clothing and our woollens and cereal
produce as badly as we want tlieir tea, their
rice and their silks. Our trade figures with
“the East’’ are in thousands. It should be
in millions.—Yours etc., D. P. P. O'K.
The Use of Alcohol Fuel
“Crow-eater’’: It is not wholly true
that alcohol-petrol mixtures engender exces-
sive heat. The addition of alcohol actu-
ally lowers the flame temperature. The
principal reason is that alcohol has a much
higher latent heat of vaporisation than petrol,
resulting in a lower temperature of the gas
drawn in. This same feature gives to
alcohol great value when used as a racing
fuel. It increases the density of the charge,
by which means more oxygen is drawn in
each induction. In the final analysis, the
utmost power of any engine (internal com-
bustion) is determined by the weight of
oxygen it can efficiently consume in a given
time. To do justice to alcohol a higher
degree of compression is necessary according
to the percentage of alcohol present. Un-
fortunately, with» existing engines this
requires structural alterations:. The heat
value of alcohol per gallon is roughly only
two-thirds that of petrol; therefore much
more of it is necessary. Alcohol alone wall
never show to full advantage unless used
in engines designed specifically for its use.
All true Australians will encourage develop-
ments in that direction. Think of the crisis
that would hit us if foreign petrol supplies
were cut off now !
“Jackaburra”: The other day I was mak-
ing up a quotation, and being a little doubt-
ful as to the number of bottles in a case
of Blank’s tomato-sauce, I asked and received
the following information: “The cases we’ve
got here now vary from 2J to 3 dozen; next
load that comes in might contain different
sizes again.” So I made up my quotation
with a line which I knew could be depended
upon to contain a specified number always.
Yet Blank’s tomato-sauce is a first-class
article. It is the same with dozens of every-
day lines—some factories stick to certain
sized cases, others to a. slightly smaller or
larger one, and others again (like Blank’s)
just put ’em in any old cases they happen
to have.

Once more bitter complaint has been made
by overseas woolbuyers of the persistence
with which Australian woolgrowers adhere
to the woolpack with the broad blue stripe
woven down the middle. The latest com-
plainant is the Japanese Woolbuyers’ Asso-
ciation, which has entered formal protest
against the use of this type of pack. Jute
packs of any sort are a nuisance, since
always a certain quantity of fibre has to be
hand-picked out of the wool. The blue streak
has the additional disadvantage that fibres
from it persist in showing up in the finished
article, while the dye runs in the scouring and
permanently colors the wool. As much of the
fine wool which goes to Japan from Aus-
tralia becomes white mousseline-de-laine, the
dye question is a serious one. The blue
stripe selves no useful purpose, and Aus-
tralian wool authorities of all descriptions
are agreed that its use should be prohibited.

Union Theatres has recently produced in
Melbourne a sound-recording device which
is. claimed to equal any imported. At a
trial the absence of the background of hum
was noticed by everybody. The new inven-
tion is claimed to be entirely unlike any
previous apparatus, and if this is so it will
be welcome news to several people who have
been held back from engaging in Australian
talkies. Two large concerns have for a
long time been prepared to sell their appa-
ratus, but have refused to accompany it with
a guarantee that it does not infringe any
foreign patent. One big picture-making
syndicate was obliged to go to U.S.A. for
its gear for this reason, and suffered a lot
of undeserved abuse for doing so.

“Mij”: Not all who receive money from
Britain benefit by the high exchange rate.
Take the case of Imperial pensioners living
in Australia. I am an ex-service man whose
injuries are valued at 12s. weekly. When
lately I made inquiries re increase equal to
the rate of exchange, I was informed there
was nothing doing. An arrangement had
been made between the War Office and the
various Dominions that pensions would not
be subject to any variations of exchange.
So if Mr, Theodore or somebody should in-
flate our currency till our f was worth only
a few shillings, we pensioners would be
paid as though' it was still worth an honest
20s.

The Australian Agents-General have been
treated to a demonstration of the combination
rail and road motor-vehicle which was
referred to recently in The Bulletin. The
change from one to the other 'takes only a
couple of minutes, and the big railway cos.
are already utilising the thing for subsidiary
lines and for slack-period working on the
main lines, the lorries and cars carrying both
freight and passengers. E. G. Macartney
(Q.) was right when he said that such an
invention 30 years ago would —or, at any
rate, should —have saved the Australian
States millions wasted in constructing non-
productive lines. It is not too late even
now. A contrivance which can run safely,
and at great speed on a railway line and
then climb off and complete the journey by
road to its objective miles aw r ay from rail
communication, should prove an aw'kward
competitor for the privately-owned motor
transport which is worrying the railway
authorities of every State.

Ralph Falkiner, of Queensland, whose
cane-harvester aroused a lot of interest
among sugar-producers a couple of years ago,
could not get the necessary backing in Aus-
tralia, so departed for America. A cable
from Florida, where he has been at work,
announces that the machine is a commerciaT
success in the canefields there. Details have
yet to come along, but it the claim is en-
dorsed it will mean a lot to Australia.

In spite of reduced freights, railage of
stock from the country to Brisbane is still
an expensive matter. One grower grappled
with the problem lately when he brought
down a mob of 1250 sheep from north of
Warwick on the Darling Downs to Brisbane
by road. It is over 40 years since droving
has been attempted in that corner of Queens-
land, but the experiment proved a success,
the sheep arriving in fine condition. The
route taken included the crossing of the
Dividing Range at Spicer’s Gap, and the
journey occupied 12 days. Cost, 6d. per head.
By rail it would have been Is. 9d.

Many attempts have been made to com-
mercialise the various products of the Bar-
rier Reef, but so far none of them have been
very successful. The latest takes a different
direction from the others, which have mostly
been concerned with the marketing of fish,
turtle, shell and sponges. It is proposed to
put the huge natural lime deposits to be
found everywhere along the Barrier on the
market. Ordinary lime, for which the stone
has to be quarried before burning, is com-
paratively costly. On the Barrier there are
miles of natural lime banks, which need no
other manipulation than loading and transfer
to the mainland. The lime is so fine that it
can easily be recovered by a sand-pump, and a
special vessel for the purpose is being-
designed in Brisbane. The craft is to be
able to load about 300 tons per hour and
discharge into hoppers ashore. The process
is expected to cut the present price of lime
by half, and the cane-farmers alone use some
50,000 tons per annum. Assays show very
high quality—lime carbonates 93 per cent.,
with phosphoric acid content as high as 4
per cent.

football crowd cross the creek, doesn’t worry
Mamma Black Swan, who has moved into
her new home about four yards below the
southern pier, and within arm’s reach of
the gravel path. Mamma doesn’t care a
tinker’s dam for all the piledrivers, con-
crete-mixers, traction-engines or eight-oar
boats o'n the creek, nor even for modern girls
out with their boy-friends at night. No.
She has built her house of twigs, sticks apd
flotsam just where she always meant to build
it, and now she has a dozen eggs in it and
is sitting on them, and if the city bridge
doesn’t like it it can shift. She won’t.

“Veronal” : The net-ball fungus gives one
quite a shock when picked up for the first
time just after it bursts up from the ground,
as it not infrequently does in damp weather.
The ball suddenly begins to expand until
it is four or five times the original size, the
dull-white flesh spacing out into a network
with meshes varying from about half an
inch to an inch and a half. When exposed
to the sun it soon shrinks and withers.

“Mundowie”: “Talkin’ about barberin*,”
said Beter the Painter, “you should ’ave

use an adze like him. He was a marvel.
I’ve often thought it a pity there wasn’t
competitions for adzin’, like there is for
woodchoppin’ an’ sawin’. I’d put my boots
on Bill.” “But what’s that got to do with
barberin’?” asked the man who had been
descanting on tonsorial artists! “Why,” said
Peter, “when I was workin’ with Bill I
never ’ad to use a razor. I’d just lather
meself an’ lie on me back while Bill chipped
the stubble off with the adze.”

“Syd Swag” : My neighbor caught me in
the act of killing a sheep which, luckily,
I had dragged to my side of the fence.
“Hello,” he said, his eyes on the earmark,
“so you’re one of those fellows who believe
that a stranger is a stranger even if it be-
longs to your best friend. If anyone had
told me so I wouldn’t have believed him.
I thought I knew you too well for that. Yet
what do I find? My best friend killing
one of my sheep, just because it happens to
be his side of the fence. It is not as if you
hadn’t good fat sheep of your own. Prime
young wethers that make the very best of
mutton. Good, firm, juicy chops. And yet.

“Nemesis” : From his resting-place a hag-
gard-eyed man surveyed the snowy expanse
below, rippled only by gently-contoured hills
and valleys. His eye
brightened as, far
away, he saw a dark
speck on one of the
farther hills. His
enemy at last! The
man lay very still,
controlling - his breath-
ing as though even_ at
that distance the im-
placable foe he had
sworn to slay might
sense . his presence.
Nearer and nearer
grew the speck, and
then suddenly van-
ished. “An old trick,”
muttered the man in
ambush. “He’ll scout
round now to take me
in the rear. But this
time I’m ready for
him!” A wait of a
few minutes; then, on
a hillock to the far
right, the speck ap-
peared again. Its
movements were erra-
tic. It danced spas-
modically from side to
side. “He’s taking no
risks,” thought the
grim watcher, “but I’ll
get him yet.” The
man nervously passed
his thumb over, his
tongue. Then he
leaped into action.
There was a short
fierce struggle, but the
odds were all against
the newcomer. Squirm-
ing in the powerful
grip of his opponent
he was thrown face
downwards. Followed
then the horrid sound
of a backbone crack-
ing. “There,” said
the man with satisfac-
tion, looking at a bloodspot on his thumb-
nail, “that darned flea won’t trouble me
again to-night.”
“Hamer” : Sydney’s most expert catch-’em-

was done by inserting the arm through the
back of one of the gills, and jerking the
hook free; the gill is a bony plate with a

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I’ve followed gold for forty years,” old Joe
remarked, “in lots o’ ways;
I’ve chased the ’weight an’ sunk the shaft
since what blokes call the roarin’ days;
An’ spent a tidy bit in pubs, be sure, since
first I hit the track,
An’, strange to say, the whitest Bung of all
I ever met was black.
“Don’t think I’m meaning tarbrusli-dashed
or any of those Dago shades:
A full-blood nigger, nothin’ less, black as the
blinkin’ ace of spades.
His ancestors, I’d say, were coves who tore
along the Congo’s bank
Before the slavers collared them. His nation-
ality was Yank.
“The moniker was Edward Scott above his
beershop at the Dawn
(The Four-Mile in the early days) where
many a foamin’ pint was drawn.
An’ in those wild and woolly times he always
got his share of biz,
As well he might, for all his skin, with such
a heart of gold as his.
“They had no lock-up at the Dawn, at first,
wherein to coop a drunk,
An’ so, if one got fightin’ mad, the cops would
chain him to a trunk,
A mulga trunk, and leave him there beneath
the stars the.long night through,
To wake a sore and sorry man, more than
a little thirsty, too.
THEY DO HANG ON TO THEIR JOBS.
“Cripes! This depression makes a fellow scratch hard, doesn’t it?”
“To that queer clink —an’ when a makeshift
boob was built ’twas just the same—
At break o’ day, week in, week out, a minis-
tering angel came,
As welcome (and as black) as those kind
ravens that Elijah fed ;
Only it wasn’t bread he brought—no parch
was ever slaked with bread.
“There’d be a pick-me-up for each beneath
that nigger’s bulgin’ coat:
A beer to save a fellow’s life by goin’ hissiu’
down his throat;
A nip o’ something stronger, p’r’aps; ’twas
charity no' cop would stop—
An’ anyway Ned never failed to bring a
bottle for the cop.
“You’ll never know how much you want a
cove to lob along an’ shout
Unless you’ve been like one of those chaps
that I’m tollin’ you about.
Those drunks they’d pinched were twice the
men to face the beak —or so ’twas said;
I had it second-hand, of course —after that
morning nip with Ned.
“I’ll bet Elijah liked those birds that brought
his scran,” reflected Joe,
“Though they were black as soot as well as
if they’d been as white as snow.
An’ all the time I’ve chased the ’weight an'
carried bluey on me back,
I tell you straight, the whitest Bung of all
I ever met was black.”

WHEN MAKING YOUR WILL
REMEMBER THIS
MANY men believe that in making their will they are
bequeathing their whole property to their dependents.
In actual fact this is not so. Probate tax makes a
heavy inroad into many bequests. To overcome this difficulty,
the P. & C. Probate Assurance was evolved. It provides the
ideal solution, pays for probate tax, obviates forced sales and
provides adequate money for dependents during the long assess-
ment period. Discuss the matter with their representatives or

when water gives out in drought-stricken

queer coincidence. “What are you going to

“Taniwha”: The Kahitangatata Hospital
Board ranged itself round. the table with a
serious air; business, the appointment of a
resident medical officer. The secretary read the
applications—some from young men with
several degrees and little experience, others
from elderly men with no more than bare
qualifications but whole loads of experi-
ence. “I like the sound of that chap,” said
Woolpress, the chairman, in reference to
one application. “Let’s hear it again.” So'
the secretary read it over again. The appli-
cant wound up a recital of his qualifications
with the proud boast that his father was
head of a famous London hospital, his uncle
was a surgeon to the King, and his grand-
father was the inventor of nine new opera-
tions. But the board wasn’t impressed. Its feel-
ing was crystallised by Mings, the cow-cocky,
who said, “I move, Mr. Chairman, that the
sekkert’ry write; to that there bloke and tell
him that if we want him at all we want
him as a doctor —not to breed from.”

“Dr. Mivart”: I don’t know why there
should be any incredulity on the subject of
animal suicides. A most striking case is to be
found in Scandinavia. The small rodent
known as the lemming periodically swims
in shoals from Norway—so local tradition
persists—to a point in mid-Atlantic, as,, if
seeking vainly for the lost Atlantis or some-
thing, and eventually drown themselves. But
what I meant to tell you about was my cat
■ H’ortense d’Aguilar (No. 58). Hortense was
reserved and haughty to most people, but had
a passionately jealous temperament, and
where she did love she loved not wisely but
too well. Her affections were set on my young-
est daughter, Felissa, and she would receive
food from no other hands. She jumped with
delight when Felissa gave her a smile, and
trembled with fear at her frown. All went
well till the cat Roderick Rufus (No. 74).
a ginger male of uncertain lineage, came
amongst us. Felissa made much of the new-
comer and neglected Hortense. The Senorita
d’Aguilar stood it for a while, but one morn-
ing on visiting the cattery I found her still
and cold. Her head was off. She had, so
I deduced, thrust her head sideways through
the bars of her pen and then, turning it

strength to effect a severance. Thenceforth
Felissa was banished from the cattery and
Roderick followed her into banishment.

“Fernie”: All the missing and mysterious
millions that are claimed by Australasian
heirs aren’t domiciled in Britain or America.
There’s a family named Moore, scattered over
the six States and the Dominion, that, be-
lievos it has a perfectly good title to a big
block in the heart of Auckland city- the
region bounded by Queen, Wyndham, Swan-
son and Albert streets. In the ’forties,
when Auckland was the .seat of gov-
ernment, the then Government Printer,
J. J. Moore, bought the land from Hone
Heke, that warlike chieftain, for 305., one
red blanket and one musket. When lus
daughter married, Moore made over the pro-
perty to her by deed of gift and had tie dee

After many years his daughter returned to
Auckland, to find that the page in the offi-
cial records on which her deed was regis-
tered had vanished. The land was in the
hands of persons who had acquired their
titles from “squatters,” who had acquired
their titles by paying rates on property for
which at the time there was no claimant.
Moore’s daughter, after spending hundreds
of pounds in search of evidence of title, gave
up the quest as hopeless, and there the matter
stands.

“Ben Digo” : Informed that the water supply
was to be turned off at the reservoir at 4
p.m. next day, Harry (Clarke, my provident
next-door neighbor, decided to circumvent the
threatened drought by renovating and filling
his 1000-gallon tank. The following after-
noon, after soldering up the holes, he
attached the garden hose to a tap, placed
the other end in the tank —it reached right
to the bottom —and turned on the fluid. He
observed with satisfaction a few minutes be-
fore four o’clock that the old tank was almost
running a banker, and adjourned to the
Limerick Castle pub to tell the lads of the
village about his cleverness. After several
rounds, remembering that he had not turned
the water off. he rushed back to the yard
expecting to find a small flood in progress.
But not so. Everything including the tank
was dry—dry as the middle of the Mallee.
The water had been cut off at the fountain-
head as per schedule, and householders in
using the last drop had created a vacuum
in the system, so that Harry’s 998-gallons
with many sucks and gurgles had siphoned
back into the pipes. The worst of it was
that when he got back to the pub it. was
after six.

“Frigid”: There is at least one Australian
timber that is better appreciated abroad than
at home —Tasmanian myrtle. The British Post
Office uses it for its telephone cabinets, and the
piano firm of Broadwood has discovered that
in addition to its durability and beauty it is
the only timber that will not expand, con-
tract, wind or warp after seasoning. It is
for this reason that Tas. myrtle is almost
universally employed for ladies’ boot-heels.

“T. Ruff” : Is there really any difference
between fish caught with the hook and
trawled fish ? I mean when you get them on
the plate. There are those, of course, w T ho
swear that the hooked fish, bleeding ever so
.little, is always a
more delicate proposi-
tion. The dynamited
fish, that dies from
suffocation, is never
much chop, I think.
Yet if your nigger is
the usual nigger he’ll
go on dynamiting fish
so long as he can get
anything to dynamite
with ; and that too in
spite of the fact that
most of them lose an
arm or part of one
sooner or later. One
well-known old island
hand took his boss-boy
up to Samarai to see
all the sights; and
among other things
the boss showed him
in the local pub a pic-
ture of Nelson with
the empty coat-sleeve
well to the front.
“Well, what do you
think of that fellow?”
asked the boss, getting ready to pitch a tale
about the little Admiral. “Him fool
bin dynamitin’ fish,” said the boss-boy, and
turned that fellow down as too silly to be
further bothered with.

“Tiki” : Maoriland has its little share of
Henry Lawson. For a period in the early
days of his married life Henry taught, school
at Maungamanu, a little settlement, mostly
Maori, on a desolate South Island beach,
backgrounded by the white caps of the Kai-
kouras. He wrote-a good deal there, and the
curious may trace in some of his poems his
reaction to the austere landscape that was his
setting. He used to relate with a chuckle how,
having set his little brown, and white charges
a task that would keep them quiet for a bit,
he would get immersed in a set of verses
and awake with ai start to find every kid
solemnly dipping a pen and scattering big
blots all over the floor in imitation of
teacher. To such congenial cronies as he
could find in that tiny settlement Lawson
damned “old women of critics,” with their
eternal references to “poor” Gordon, “poor”
Kendall, “poor” Boake, “poor” Bracken.
Henry couldn’t see how a poet could po.s-
sibly be poor, and his democratic soul (he
spent his time helping the stoker On his
voyage from Wellington to Kaikoura in the
little steamer Wakatu) resented furiously
the supercilious patronage accorded him by
some reviewers. One advised him to study
Homer in the original. “Who the did
Homer study?” was Lawson’s tart retort.
A memory of those Maoriland days that the
poet cherished was the time he rode into
Kaikoura, seven miles away, “to taste a drop
of cheer.” His young wife had with her an
elderly Maori dame. Mrs. Lawson was ex-
tremely apprehensive regarding her hus-
band’s safety. “He’ll be thrown off and
break his neck!” she cried. “Werry rikery”
(likely), responded the brown lady placidly.
“Oh, I’m sure Henry will be drowned at the
ford!” was a later premonition. “Werry
rikery,” agreed the native matron. But
Henry got home in good order and condition.
It was the blue-gums that drew him back to
his own land —blue-gums and the sight of the
sea and ships passing. He browsed prin-
cipally on Dickens while at Maungamanu,
and it was probably there that he wrote the
lines commencing: “I treasure all the master
wrote.”
* * * *
“Gouger”: Some 35 years ago at the Men-
indie Crossing (N.S.W.) there was a baked-
clay bush pub kept by a chap named Gordon.
It was a tradition of this hostelry, handed
down from the. first licensee, to trade with
Binghi for curios in a rum currency. Gradu-
ally there grew up what was called the
“Never-Never Museum,” the contents of
which were eventually stacked outside around
the wall of a drought-stricken garden. It
was a wonderful collection of aboriginal
craftsmanship, containing shields, nullahs,
boomerangs, womeras, spears, yam-sticks,
churingas, coolamons, big hollowed nardoo
dishes of stone, grinding stones, stone toma-
hawks, initiation knives, totem woods and
other articles. Equally interesting was a
collection of rusty firearms that might have
come from the Ark. There were several short
old-fashioned carbines—one with a bell mouth
—revolvers with five barrels, and a lot of old-
time horse-pistols. These had all been looted
by the abos. from the camps of explorers,
Burke and Wills among the number, who
travelled over the crossing. When Gordon
left to take over a pub in Broken Hill he
tried to secure the relics for the Adelaide
Museum, but found that they were included
in the lease of the pub. I suppose those
priceless relics are now scattered far and
wide.

“Sea Nomad” : There is no reason to doubt
that the Newnes shale-field in N.S.W. is a
dinkum deposit, but there are some outcrops
of shale along the coast that weren’t put
there by Mother Nature. In the old days
several ships went ashore in Torres Strait
waters, loaded with oil shale for treatment
overseas, and this shale has been picked up
on quite a number of islands. Coal, planted
in the same fashion, is even more frequently
met with, and has been responsible for rais-
ing a great many false hopes.

CAPTAIN COOK ARRIVES.
“S. M. Herald”: Every patriotic Aus-
tralian will be gratified by the unexpected,
but none the less welcome, arrival of the
eminent navigator Capt. James Cook, R.N.
Wherever the flag breasts the breeze his
name and fame are known, not merely as
an intrepid sailor, not merely as one of our
foremost navigators, but as a harbinger of
prosperity. Is it too much to hope that our
visitor may be but the first of many from
the homeland? May we not anticipate that
British capital will follow in his wake in
the near future, thus enabling us to build
more speedways, lay out and patronise more
pony courses, and support more politicians?
“Labor Daily”: Captain Cook appeared
out of the void yesterday, and is being feted
and junketed at Government House. What's
the game? That’s the question every true
unionist should ask himself. The “toothless
crone of Hunter-street” seems to think that
this already over-burdened State is in for
a capitalistic invasion by Cook, and his
unscrupulous business pals, comparable to
that of Tamerlane and Khan. One
thing is certain: Otto von Ivuik, to give
him his right name, is not here for nothing.
We regard his uninvited intrusion as a chal-
lenge to the Lang Plan, and, as such, our
countless readers may rely on its being
opposed by us to the last ditch.
“Sunday Guardian” (Society section) : I
saw Capt. “Jimmy” Cook, R.N. (who is, of
course, one of the Whitby Cooks), enjoying
himself hugely at his Ex.’s partyette on
Friday. Exquisite Evie Bilge (her father
married a Water in the seventies, which
everybody thought so appropriate) was hav-
ing the time of her life, and so was beautiful
Mrs. Sexagenarian, who is positively goofy
about the fascinating sailorman. (Inset:
Picture of a whiting similar to those caught
near Whitby.)
Mr. Garden, intercepted at the gates of
Government House, said: “I am on my way,
under instructions from the Trades Hall
(Economics Branch), to ask Captain Cook
if his banker-friends in London intend to
lend the Government £18,000,000 at 6 per
cent, (interest to be scaled down on delivery
of the cash to 1 per cent.), and if not why
not. Usurious overseas capitalism has been
the cause of untold misery in the past, and
the A.L.IA is determined that its fangs shall
be clipped. My instructions are that in the
event of the captain’s bloodsucker friends
being unwilling to lend as much as
£18,000,000, less will be taken.”
“Truth”: There’s a little White-haired
Mother away in dear old Whitby by the sea,
and her loving heart
is swelling with
pride at the great
reception they’re giv-
ing her boy Jim in
Aussie. , For he’s
still little Jim to her.
bless her sainted
Mother’s Heart!
But she doesn’t talk ;
just looks wistfully
out over the ocean
when his name is
mentioned, and then
turns from the frame
of honeysuckle sur-
rounding the window
by which she is sit-
ting and gazes at
the beautiful art-
photo of his fine old
dad on the wall —the
dad who is now in
Heaven. Why does
she look wistful?
Well, one reason may
be that she’s heard
of young Jim’s go-
ings-on with the girls
in Tahiti. He’s a
gay lad is Jimmy,
and some of the
Tahiti husbands say
they’ll half kill him if he ever goes back
there.

MY SENTIMENTS.

declared the speaker.”— “Sim.”
A friend in need is worth two in the bush.
That’s what I says, says I. If you cast your
bread to the underdog he’ll come back, by
and by. It’s a long, long lane blows good
to none, and a stitch in time is a deed well
done, and a soft word spoken’s a fight half
won. That’s what I says, says I.
There’s many an honest heart, I says,
that beats upon a throne. There’s many a
true word raises laughs; but you weep,' so
I says, alone. You should be just before you
leap. Be penny-wise and so you reap, and
all that glitters may run deep. That’s what I
says, says I.
A wise tongue has a silent head but keeps
its powder dry; it’s a poor heart never
makes its hay for a rainy day, says I. The
foot of clay defiles the touch ; but a kindly
heart is the cripple’s crutch ; and a twisted
proverb don’t matter much. That’s what I
says, says I.

THE MAN
ON THE LANS'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
NEXT SEASON’S WOOL FREIGHTS.
Practically all Australia’s wool goes away
under an agreement entered into between the
representatives of the overseas shipowners
and representatives of the woolgrowers of all
the States. For last season and for some
time previously the rate was per pound,
with certain rebates and deductions. Charges
have been calculated on weight at the end
of the voyage: that is to say, the shipper
has been charged for carrying the moisture
which the wool absorbs on the voyage.
For some time past there has been a good
deal of dissatisfaction with the rate charged
for wool. It has been urged that, whereas
it: is charged lid. per pound, payment to be
made at. the other end (which means that
the present charge is lid. plus 30 per cent.,
Or approximately L§d. less the rebates), re-
frigerated cargo is carried at fd. per pound;
and refrigerated cargo calls for coal consump-
tion all the way and the constant attention of
engineers, apart from the ordinary services
of the vessel. There is, however, no alter-
native shipping service which would carry
the cai’go; so the rates which ruled last
year were resubmitted and eventually
accepted with slight modifications.
The rate compares unfavorably not only
with the |d. for refrigerated cargo but
also with the id. which S. Africans pay on
their wool shipped to Europe. This latter rate,
it is said, was reached after the woolgrowers
had enlisted the support of the S’African
Government and certain representations
had been made by that authority.
It is complained by some of those who have
been interested for years past in this ques-
tion of freights that a large proportion of
Australian growers refuse to consider them-
selves concerned in the matter. They sell
their wool in the Australian market, and
they say that what the buyer has to pay is
no concern of theirs—no direct concern, any-
way. Actually, of course, the buyer works
out what he can afford to' pay to the last
farthing (though it doesn’t necessarily follow
that he always pays it). Actually, therefore,
the freight doesn’t interest him: every farth-
ing added to it means simply that he is able
to pay a farthing less to the grower. From
one point of view, in fact, high freights may
suit the buyer. He is allowed a rebate,
which long has been regarded as the fund
out of which he should pay his expenses;
and the higher the freight the larger this
fund.
Still, though there is disappointment over
the maintenance of the old rate, some com-
fort is got from the abandonment of the old
practice of charging on weight of wool at
the end of the voyage. It is suggested that
the next assault to be made) upon old
customs should be on the “draft” —the pound
in every hundredweight of which the wool-
grower complains that he makes the buyer
a present. Certainly in this case the buyer
protests that nobody in that trade makes
presents of anything, and that competition
compels that all these concessions shall be
allowed for in fixing the price. But there
would be no call for any allowances if the
buyer had to pay for exactly what lie
bought—no more and no less—and the
grower was paid on the same basis.
A SHEEP-TRUCK WRINKLE.
“Warrego”: Sheepowners seldom know
how many sheep to send to trucking yards
to fill the trucks ordered. Whatever a man’s
experience may be, it is nearly impossible
to accurately estimate the number (especi-
ally if they are mixed sexes and ages) that
will fit the various types of trucks. And
left-over sheep are hard to get home.
Growing tired of guesswork, a Western
Queenslander hit on the happy notion of
erecting beside his drafting yards pens of
the dimensions of one deck of each of the
Queensland sheep-trucks. When sending
sheep away by rail he simply fills the appro-
priate pen, and by a simple calculation works
out the number to send to' trucks. Further-
more, by walking round the pen he can see
that the trucks will be properly filled—
always a difficult matter when loading actual
trucks. All Queensland trucks are double-
deckers, and the “N” van alone has a parti-
tion. This must be allowed for when making
a pen of this size. A good substitute for the
sliding door is an ordinary sheep hurdle.
For a cheap and easy method of filling
trucks safely to capacity, this method is un-
beatable. Sizes of trucks vary in different
States, but any decent stationmaster will
always give dimensions of the trucks his
system uses.
PEAR LAND SHAPING WELL.
“Pulque”: Selectors who' have nerved
themselves to take up reclaimed prickly-pear
lands in Queensland have had a pleasant sur-
prise. The opinion was widely held that
land which has carried a mat of pear is like
that sown, according to the custom of old
times, with salt. At the best it was hoped
that in years to come it might develop into
light grazing country. Experience has shown
that this is all wrong.
The Cactoblastis caterpillar leaves the de-
stroyed pear a decaying mass on the ground.
Those taking up the pear lands under the
special terms offered have found that the
vegetable overburden is a valuable asset,
since it enriches the soil. The farmer is
ploughing it in for humus, and the grazier
is sowing paspalum and other grasses. Both
have been well satisfied with results to date.
WHEAT VARIETIES,
“Corrigin”; The high praise given to
Nabawa by Bulletin contributors after the
1929-30 harvest is echoed by experts report-
ing on last year’s operations. Dealing with
the results of field experiments in the N.S.W.
Western District Senior Agricultural-
Instructor Arthur writes that the outstanding-
varieties were Nabawa, Geeralying, Bredbo,
Canimbla and Ford.
“Nabawa,” he says, “is a mid-season wheat
from Westralia, which has already demon-
strated its high yielding qualities under dry
conditions and its almost total immunity to
flag smut. During the past year it has also
shown high resistance to rust and ability to
give consistently high yields after making
heavy rank early growth, with the result
that in future it must be looked upon as a
reliable variety to grow on any soil and
under any .conditions. Geeralying is another
Westralian early-maturing variety showing
high immunity to flag smht. It gave the
highest yields in four out of the six centres
where it was tested this season. While not
as resistant to rust as Nabawa it seems
likely to be a useful late-sowing wheat, and
may replace varieties like Riverina, Can-
berra and Florence.”
Nabawa also proved its worth in the
N.S.W. Middle West area. According to
Senior Agricultural-Instructor Nicholson, “it
has been a most consistent yielder, and ex-
hibits a greater resistance to disease than
any other variety under test. In addition
to being highly disease-resistant, it is pro-
ductive, and can adapt itself to a wide range
of conditions. Under test for the past few
years Nabawa has yielded consistently in
dry and wet seasons and on varying types
of soil.” He points out, however, that “when
ripe the straw becomes very brittle, and
should rain fall on the ripe crop this weak-
ness is intensified, making stripping difficult,
due to frequent choking in the comb.”
In N. S. Wales, as in Victoria, the march
of progress is leaving Federation wheat
behind. Says Mr. Arthur, “Federation used
as a mid-season standard wheat has given
such poor yields compared with Nabawa
that in future it will be discarded in favor
of the latter.” But what a great variety it
has proved, and how everlastingly grateful
Australia should be to Farrer!
BURN THE STUBBLE!
“Jamwood” : Burning the stubble is a uni-
versal practice among Australian wheat-
farmers, but not a few have a lingering notion
that it, is wrong and wasteful. “Wouldn’t
it be better to plough in the straw, at least
occasionally?” is a question always asked of
the N.S.W. Department of Agriculture at
this time of the year. The reply invariably is
“No; burn the stubble, by all means.”
A recent departmental bulletin goes into
details. “A good stubble burn,” it says, "is
one of the best means of destroying fungus
spores, and is therefore of great assistance
in combating such diseases as flag smut,
take-all, wheat blight and wheat mildew.” On
the other hand, ploughing-in of stubble en-
courages fungus diseases; it also makes it
extremely difficult, if not impossible, to bring
about a good consolidation of the sub-sur-
face soil. The moisture-holding capacity of
the soil is also affected temporarily. The
department insists that results of experiments
in wheat districts throughout N. S. Wales
indicate that wheat yields are reduced when
the straw is ploughed in. Recent American
experiments indicate that there is also a
detrimental effect on the nitrogen content of
the soil; “the more straw is ploughed in
the greater is the loss of nitrates.” So
“from every point of view, the burning of
wlieaten or oaten straw is preferable to
ploughing it in.”
CHANGE OF SEED.
“Yeoman”: There is a persistent belief
among farmers that a change of Seed of, say,
the same type from another locality is
invariably beneficial. This, under normal
conditions, is not so. Really the practice
of making a change of seed is more likely
to result in a reduced yield than an improve-
ment unless the imported seed is of a defi-
nitely proved superior strain by reason of
careful selection, or unless the home seed
has deteriorated through neglect. Under
otherwise equal conditions seed imported from
one district to another is subject to climatic
influences which will affect the. yield * until
acclimatisation takes place.
Unless an improved and selected strain of
a well-known variety, or an established and
superior new variety, be imported, efficient
growers are well advised to stick to their
own home-grown seed, if true to type. Har-
vesting one’s own grain flfat is dead ripe,
true to type, and free from disease, and
then grading it thoroughly, will provide the
best seed.
Gluyas and King’s Early, two popular
wheats in S. Aus., have been grown con-
tinually at Roseworthy Agricultural College
for 36 years without change, and both, varie-
ties have considerably improved in yielding
qualities during that period.
PIGS FOR THE BRITISH MARKET.
“I.I.”: “Sendee” (B. 4/3/’3l) expresses
surprise that the Vic. Government contem-
plates breeding the Large White on
Middle York for experiments in feeding wheat
to pigs. Let me assure him that the officials
of the Vic. Agricultural Department know
their job.
The people of Australia are not a bacon-
eating race. Their average yearly consump-
tion is 11.71 b. as against the Briton’s 41.81 b.
and the Canadian’s 87.71 b. We must look
to the export trade if there is to be any
great expansion of the industry. No coun-
try that does not use the Large White sire
gets top prices on the English market. Den-
mark, Ireland, Canada, Scotland, all after
committees had studied the question and, re-
commended the Large White sire as the
standard for the English market, have
secured top prices. The countries that have
not specialised in Large Whites, notably the
U.S.A. and Australia, have had to take much
lower returns.
In 1928-29 the British Ministry of Agri-
culture, to encourage farmers in the use of
good sires, gave premiums on 917 boars, of
which 517 were Large Whites. None were
Tamworths. Surely in the land of their
origin practical men know the relative value
of the breeds. In business it is a good rule
to supply the article your customers demand.
Ten years ago', on the advice of an officer
in the Vic. department, I substituted a
Large White boar for a Tamworth, and I
have never regretted it. I have bred nearly
2000 pigs since then, and not one ever gave
any trouble through sun scald. Of course,
because a pig is called a Large White he
is not necessarily a good sire; he must have
the characteristics of the breed that have
made it the world’s standard bacon pig, and
a reliable pedigree to secure prepotency.
MAORILAND SHOWS THE WAY.
“Boneen”; Recent writers on feeding
wheat to pigs have had much to' say about
the breeding and general welfare of the gintle-
man, that paid the rint in Ireland, whenever
any was paid. The equally important
matter of marketing piggy when he is trans-
muted into pork has been neglected. At this
time, when Australian pork is finding favor
at Smithfield (an order for 12,000 carcases,
says Premier Moore, has been received in
Queensland) a glance at the Maoriland
methods of grading may be informative. M.L.,
as most stock-producers know, has evolved a
rigid system of grading produce which is
responsible for the high prices that its butter,
mutton, lambs, etc., bring on the British
market. Pig-raising has only recently been
taken up seriously in the Shivery Isles. A
system of grading has now been determined
on, and in future all pork exported from
Maoriland will have to conform to 'the
standards.
Baconers of the first grade, barrows and
maiden sows must be uniform in length,
finish and conformity. Lightness of neck and
shoulders is required, while the leg must
be well finished to the hock. Thickness of
backfat should be in proportion, and not
over lfin. on the shoulder. A minimum of
28in. is allowed for length of loin from h.
bone to first rib. Finally, the fat must be
white and firm, and free from oil or fish
taint —in some of the coastal districts fish
and mutton-birds are fed. The porker has
to pass practically the same exam. White,
firm flesh and freedom from taint is insisted
on in this section. Second-graders are prac-
tically pigs that do not measure up to the
above requirements. Pigs up to 1501 b. are
to be accepted, and Government officials will
do the grading.
M.L. is out to get a cut of the Denmark
trade with Britain, which is worth a million
a week, and is going the right way to accom-
plish its ambition. Now Australian pig
experts, hop in!
TANGIER PEAS.
“Wongi”; Why don’t N. S. Wales farmers
and graziers in suitable localities try Tan-
gier peas? From my experience in South
Westralia—personal experience and inspec-
tion of crops grown by others —Tangier peas
are well worth raising for fodder, especially
on waste ground of a sandy nature or
medium loam, in a 20in. rainfall district.
Seed should be sown in early autumn.
The pea is a slow grower, but it comes along
rapidly in the spring, reaching a height (f
sft;. to 7ft. and stooling well. Eight pounds
of seed with super, will yield a good crop
on cleared ground; hoed in about 2ft. apart
on new ground after a burn it gives good feed
and smothers weed growth. Stock relish it
green, also as stubble. A cut can be made
during the growing period, and if seed is
allowed to ripen afterwards a useful volun-
teer croj) comes the following season.
I experimented with the pea in the hills
near Sydney last season. It did well on
loose soil, but went off on the heavy stuff
through lack of moisture.
NITROGEN TESTS IN MAORILAND.
“Korohai”: In Maoriland such wonderful
results have been obtained with super, on
almost all classes of country that there
hasn’t seemed to be much occasion to take
an interest in other soil stimulants. To
remedy that incuriosity Imperial Chemistry
Industries, London, three years ago donated
to the M.L. Agriculture Department a goodly
stock of sulphate of ammonia and some
“nitro-chalk”—a proprietary mixture of
ammonium nitrate and calcium carbonate.
The department has just concluded a series
of tests, which have established that sul-
phate of ammonia is a profitable proposition
for the dairy-farmer, but not of much use
to the Dominion in other branches of farming.
One of the first lines of investigation pur-
sued was in relation to root-crops. Super.,
in certain circumstances, injures germina-
tion. It was discovered that sulphate of
ammonia was a still worse offender, so that
line ended at a- dead wall. Then the use of
the sulphate in top-dressing dairying pastures
was tried. Ninety-one pairs of fields—one of
each pair for “control” and the other for
experiment—were used, scattered over 81
farms. Dressings of lcwt. of sulphate of
ammonia per acre were applied in July, in
October, in December and in March. It was
found that the two first dressings were bene-
ficial, the effect of later dressings being
negligible. The first dressings stimulated
early growth of grasses, particularly rye-grass,
cocksfoot and Yorkshire fog, and the spring
output of butter-fat was considerably increased
as compared control fields to which
super, only was applied. The average increase
in butter-fat yield for each hundredweight of
nitrogenous manure in the first season was
13Jlb. Better results still were obtained when
super, was applied at the same time as the
first two nitrogen dressings. In later seasons
an average improvement of butter-fat
to each hundredweight of ammonium sulphate
w r as recorded. The M.L. cost of ammonium
sulphate is about 12s. per hundredweight,
and with butter-fat at Is. 3d. per pound the
result showed a profit after all charges were
met. Particularly important in the view of
the officers' who conducted the tests was the
effect of the ammonium sulphate in stimu-
lating the growth of grass both earlier and
later than on plots to which super, only was
applied.
Experiments with “nitro-chalk” were made
on a very small scale. The manure is com-
posed to neutralise the acidifying effect of
ammonium sulphate on certain classes of
soil. The investigators *came to the conclu-
sion that equally good results could be
obtained more cheaply by using 2cwt. of
ground limestone with each hundredweight of
ammonium sulphate.
RENEWING BROKEN POSTS.
“Mulyan”: When the post of a rail- or
wire-fence has broken off or rotted at the
ground, it is not an easy job to put in a
new one, as rails or wires—in some fences
both —have to be taken out. To save all
that, put a new butt on the old post. The
top part is generally sound, and a butt is
easily nailed or bolted on, and will serve
just as well as a new post. In the case of
a rail-fence, let the butt come up and fit
with a slot under the bottom rail. An alter-
native with an all-wire fence is to split the
damaged post down the centre, so that the
halves will come away from the wires, and then
put in a light or flat post alongside, and
sfiaple the wires to it; or the post may be
bored, and the wires fastened with ties
passed through the holes. The latter plan
makes a strong and secure job.

If your business demands several trucks, it will cost
you less to equip with Reos, because of the smaller
number needed and because they last longer.
Let us prove these facts.
Reo Trucks in ll t wheelbase sizes provide a sturdy, dependable chassis
for 98% of all hauling needs and for ’buses of various passenger capaci-
ties. Load capacities from %-ton up through the heavy-duty range.

, MACHINERY SPECIALISTS SINCE ls«s
When the post has been eaten out by
white ants, and the part above the ground is
sound, prop the broken post of the fence
over and make a fire in the hole. The shell
and ant-stuff burn readily, and while this
cleans the hole and saves digging it also
destroys the ants. Digging a hole is quicker,
but many of the termites will be left there
to infest the new butt.
PREPARE FOR WINTER.
“Jack Point”: Winter is the time when
the good poultryman makes real profit and
the other sort bemoans his luck and curses
the elements. To begin with, fowls can’t
lay their best unless they are properly
housed. The intensive system whereby the
birds are confined the whole time will give
the best results. Arrange the house so that
it gets all the sunshine possible, especially
in the morning, whilst escaping the bleak
weather and rain. If it is on a slope,
dig a gutter round so that water can’t run
in and wet the litter, which should at ail
times be kept dry and to a depth of eight
inches or so, on the floor.
Whilst I prefer dry-mash feeding, in cold
localities the hens will respond generously to
a feed morning and night mixed to a crumbly
consistency with warm water or (preferably)
skim milk. The grain should be scattered
in the litter, so that the birds are kept busy
scratching for it. Green feed should be given
always—lucerne, rape and silver-beet are
best for winter feeding.
There are not many localities in Australia
where water actually freezes, but in some
parts it gets darned cold. Therefore, if you
don’t have to break the ice on the hens’
water supply, remember that it’s a good idea
to keep the water well above freezing-point
by means of hot water added at very nippy
times. If you don’t, every time the hen has
a drink of icy-cold water it takes a certain
amount of her bodily heat and energy to
warm it up; hence fewer eggs. It’s by
watching small details such as these that
the successful men get ahead of their less
observant neighbors, whether they keep fowls,
cows, sheep or anything else.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) At what weight should a pig he killed
for pork. (2) And for hacon? (3) Ingre-
dients and Quantities of pickla for pork, and
how long will it preserve the meat? —l963.
(1) 601 b. to 801 b. dressed weight. The
demand at present seems to be in favor of
light pork, 601 b. to 701 b. (2) 1201 b. to 1401 b.
dressed weight. (3) 551 b. salt, 51b. salt-
petre, 51b. pure cane sugar, 20 gallons of
water, boiled and skimmed until clear. A
salinometer is necessary to tell when the
mixture is the right strength (95deg. when
cool). Meat will keep indefinitely in pickle
provided the pickle is kept up to strength
and boiled occasionally. To keep it up to
the required strength salt and a small quan-
tity of sugar are added in the correct pro-
portion. On the slightest sign of froth
appearing the pickle should be boiled imme-
diately and skimmed.
How to make waxed calico for budding ?—
2241.
Select a strong cheap calico, which will
tear easily without fraying. Tear into strips
varying in width from Bin. to 15in., accord-
ing to the size of the stocks to be budded or
grafted. The strips should be wide enough
to wrap around the stocks at least four or
five times. Take three parts (by weight)
beeswax, three parts resin, two parts mutton
tallow and melt up together, and, while still
hot, dip the calico into the mixture and
draw it out between two straight-edged
sticks held tightly together. These will
remove all surplus wax and leave just enough
on the calico. If it is found that this mix-
ture is not quite sticky enough, a little
more beeswax can be added. For ordinary
budding, this waxed calico, after it is cool,
may be doubled up and nicked along its
edge at distances of about one-third of an
inch. It is then unrolled and wound on a
pointed stick. After nicking, it is readily
torn each time a small strip is required.
The stick is pointed, so that it can be stuck
into the ground and the wax cloth in this way
kept from contact with the dirt.
How to get rid of ticks and lice in poultry?
—1951.
To get rid of ticks, spray the fowlhou.se
with an emulsion made by boiling a pound of
soap in one gallon of water. While boiling
remove from the fire and stir in one gallon
of kerosene, and to this mixture add another
eight gallons of water. Spray at weekly
intervals until the tick is eradicated. If
your stock are dying, dip the birds in a 2
per cent, formalin bath. Ordinary body
lice may be kept in check by supplying the
birds with a good dust bath, or you could
try painting “black leaf 40” on the perches
about half an hour before the birds go to
roost. The fumes destroy the lice.
flow should wattle hark he M) stripped,
(2) packed for market? (3) What Sydney
firms are likely buyers? (4). Approximate
market price? —l9Bs.
(1) Best time is generally from about the
end of September till the end of December.
Make a cut in the bark about 3ft. from the
ground and then pull strips off downwards.
By so doing the bark is obtained close to
the ground or even a little below the sur-
face, at which point it is thicker and better.
After stripping the lower part of the tree
it is usually felled to expedite complete peel-
ing. Maximum production of bark is obtained
when the tree is from five to seven years
old, after which age deterioration is likely.
(2) The stripped bark should be dried, under
cover if possible, by laying the strips on
saplings laid on the ground or raised to
permit of free air passage underneath. When
completely dried the bark may be tied in
small bundles and chopped up and bagged
for sale according to the wishes of the buyers,
who may also require an analysis giving the
percentage of tannin. (3) Farmers and

about £9 per ton for first-grade bark. Second-
grade or inferior is not saleable.
How is the market in Sydney for kangaroo-
skins?—2o43.
It is now the off-season, and very few
skins are offering. As the winter approaches
a much better demand should exist; regular
sales will be held in Sydney by lead in sr skin-
merchants. Consignments from any district
must be accompanied by a certificate from
the local sergeant of police.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Disc Harrow”: Make sure that all the
pipes leading down from gutterings on house
and sheds discharge their contents well
clear of the wall. This is particularly im-
portant in the case of wooden buildings. A
handy base is the common jamtin. Lead
the pipe into the tin, cut an opening on the
side away from the wall, and there you are.
“E.11.M.”: With a drain-pipe 12in. in
diameter, a few bricks and one or two pieces
of flat iron, an efficient rubbish destructor
can be made. Place pipe in an upright posi-
tion on a number of bricks; between its base
and the bricks put wire-netting resting on
two pieces of flat iron. Light rubbish from
the bottom, wrapping wire-netting round
the pipe in case it becomes cracked ; cover
with a piece of tin when not in use. After
the rubbish has been burned, shovel it out
and use on the vegetable patch.
“Jog”: “B. Sting” (B. 4/3/’3l), who says
that a queenless hive of bees will rear a new
queen if there are any queen cells present,
fresh eggs in the other cells, or if an egg-filled
brood comb is transferred from another hive,
has made a discovery that has eluded the
rest of the world. The only way to give
the hive a new queen is to introduce
either a fully-matured impregnated queen,
or a queen cell with _ a fertile egg
or maturing queen within. The latter,
to be effective, should be done in October or
November, as the queen seldom lays a female
egg later.
“Buzz” : Let me weigh in with my blowfly
trap. It’s a wire-gauze cage divided into two
sections. In one of these is a doorway to
admit the flies; in the other is the bait—-a
lump of sugar or some trifling thing of the
kind. The entrance door opens on a .stair-
case, of which the steps are l-64th of an
inch apart. At the top of the stair is a
small platform across which the fly walks,
to descend a second stair to the bait. Now,
mark the point. The ninth step from the
top is l-32nd of an inch from the one above
it. The fly, inured by this time to the l-64th
interval already mentioned, invariably trips,
and, falling to' the bottom of the trap, breaks
his neck. Patent applied for.
“Minthall” ; In my experience you can get
a good price for the Brussels sprouts you
grow. They like a cool climate and do well
in the Speck, and in the highlands and cool
spots of Australia they will thrive to per-
fection. The .seed is cheap (about 10s. a
pound), and the culture as for cabbage.
“Notwen”: As soon as young scale is
visible on citrus-trees —and you really need
a magnifying-glass —get to work. If a pow-
der form of spray is used, choose a time
when there is no wind —towards evening is
usually best. Many growers wear a piece
of gauze over nose and mouth when spray-
ing ; but if a few rows of trees are done
each day the irritation caused by powder is
hardly noticed.
“Jack Point” : Many poultry-breeders rear
an unnecessarily large number of cockerels
to maturity. Culling may be commenced
quite early. The ideal cockerel should be
full chested, of good body size and well pro-
portioned, firm and easy in action. He
should not be excitable, but should have
sufficient ginger, a bright alert eye, not too
much headgear, and good bone. Provided
such birds are from good producing hens you
are assured of a steady improvement in next
year’s flock by following a rigid system of
culling. Remember that the male is half the
flock.
In spite of the times, the N.S.W. Agri-
cultural Society is banking on a record
Easter Show. Entries are very solid, in the
cattle section particularly. One notable
exhibit will be a pen of Red Polls from Had-
don Rig, the first of their kind seen at the
“Agra” for years, while the increasingly popu-
lar Blacks will be strongly represented. The
dairying entries show a slight falling off,
but the quality will be high, while the pigs,
beloved of the public, will be seen again
after an absence of three years due to the
swine-fever epidemic.
The Moore Government’s action in making
.available for tobacco-growing land at
Mareeba, on the tableland behind Cairns
(N.Q.), looks like turning out a winner.
Some of the growers have now put their
stuff on the market, and a Sydney expert
in blending told a press interviewer that
the product was one of the finest quali-
ties of cigarette leaf he had encountered in
a long experience. An interesting feature
of the N.Q. leaf is that in burning quality
and aroma it is utterly different from the
tobacco grown in other parts of Australia.
Considering that most of those engaged in
growing and curing the product were prac-
tically amateurs, the expert’s opinion pro-
mises well for the new venture.
“Bar Iv.” ; Australia is very short of good
draught-horses at present, and they are likely
to be expensive for some years to come. It
is to be hoped that those who seize the oppor-
tunity to breed draughts will select the right
type, and provide for the lean years by
systematic top-dressing of pastures and the
introduction of grazing lucerne, clovers and
grasses. A top-dressing of super, is worth
inches of rain, and the presence of lucerne
in the pasture lands is worth acres of
natural grass.
America has been making a fuss over the
centenary of the reaping-machine, which'
was allegedly invented by one McCormick,
of the now famous firm, in 1831. Four
years earlier, though, Patrick Bell, a Scot-
tish divinity student of farming stock, in-
vented and worked a reaper on his father’s
farm. It was shown at the Highland
Society’s show in 1828 and gained a gold
medal and a prize of £5O.

Has the Governor-General of Australia the
right of veto regarding projected legislation
after passing loth Federal Houses?— 2273.
The Governor-General’s powers in this
respect are defined in Section 58 of the Com-
monwealth Constitution : “When a proposed
law passed by both Houses of the Parliament
is presented to the Governor-General for
the King’s assent, he shall declare, accord-
ing t? lijs discretion, but subject to this
Constitution, that he assents in the King’s
name, or that he withholds assent, or that
he reserves the law for the King’s pleasure.
The Governor-General may return to the
House in which it originated any proposed
law so presented to him, and may transmit
therewith any amendments which he may
recommend, and the Houses may deal with
the recommendation.”

Tax? (2) lam a resident of N.S.W. with

(1) Legal action will be taken against
them by the Taxation Department for re-
covery of the amount assessed. (2) The
Act provides that the tax is payable on
income derived by a resident of N.S.W. from
all sources, the only exception being in the
case where a resident is carrying on a busi-
ness outside N.S.W. It is a rank swindle
to tax income from other States, and the Tax-
payers’ Association ought to have it tested.
(3) Federal servants are subject to the same
Unemployment Relief Tax as other people.
I am with a party prospecting for gold.
We have sunk shafts from 40 ft. to 100 ft. in
depth. There is water in each. What is
the most suitable type of pump and method
of rigging it? We have an 8-h.p. Tangye oil-
engine.— 2072.
Probably a drawlift of the deep-well type
would suit. This class of pump has rods
inside the rising main. A rigid guide for
crosshead is necessa-ry, but a balance is not
usually used in shallow shafts. The form
of crank depends solely on local circum-
stances but the disc crank is common. As
it is proposed to work with an oil-engine
some method should be adopted to reduce
the speed, either by a counter-shaft and
pulleys or by a speed-reducing jack.
(1) The ratepayers of a, small municipality
in N.S.W. wish to have the municipality
merged into the shire. llow should, they
go about it? (2) If they are successful
would the town residents have the power to

—2019.
(1) Procedure is prescribed in Section 19
of the N.S.W. Local Government Act, a
copy of which can be obtained from the Local
Government Dept., Bligh-street, Sydney.
(2) The electors of the municipality would
become electors of the new area, and would
be able to nominate candidates and exercise
their franchise. The area originally com-
prised in the municipality might become a
separate riding of the new shire, and that
question should be looked into at the time of
union.

above applies to metropolitan clubs which
shoot at Liverpool. The return rail fare

greater.
(1) How should a garden lily-and-goldfish
pond be constructed and maintained? (2)
Any boohs on the subject? —223s.
Draw a design to fit the position where
the pond is to be erected; then consult a
cement-mixing firm. Stipulate that the struc-
ture must be reinforced to minimise cracking.
Since some fish like deep water, design a
bottom of varying depth. Small overflow
pipes, about Gin. from the top of the pond, to
carry off surplus water should be allowed for,
and a tap near the base is necessary for clean-
ing. A continual supply of fresh water is
necessary if water-lilies are to be grown, and
the ponds must be cleaned regularly. (2)

and Sons.
Time and method of planting Christmas-
bush seed ? —2232.
Gather dead flowers and place them in a
paper bag until the seed is dry and released,
then sow in shallow boxes of sandy loam.
Present time is suitable. When the young
plants come up give the boxes a top-dressing
of bush soil. The plants should be shifted
to pots or tins as soon as the second row
of leaves appears, and watered regularly.
Grow the plants in an open, warm situation
in order to force them to make plenty of
root-growth. It takes about four years to
grow a plant big enough to carry flowers.

“Weekly Scotsman ” of Jan. 10 says Alex-
ander MacDonald, F.R.0.5., has acquired
gold-prospecting rights over 10 square miles
in Q’land. (1) Has such a concession been
granted, and if so what are its terms? (2)
Has MacDonald had any previous experience
of gold-mining in Australia, and the nature
of such experience? —22s6.
(1) By an Act of the Q’land Parliament
dated Dec. 30 last MacDonald was granted a
five years’ concession over 7000 acres in the
Chillagoe district on terms requiring him to
commence development work within nine
months and spend £lO,OOO within 24 months,
and £4OOO during each of three successive
years. (2) Q’land Mines Dept, records show
that some years ago MacDonald was asso-
ciated with others in mining in the Chillagoe
district; £250,000, mostly introduced from
abroad, was expended, and 14,976 tons of
ore was treated, yielding gold to the value of
£152,018.
I have some margosa-tree seeds sent from
Ceylon. What soil do they grow in, and
what is the best time of the year to plant?
—2046.
The margo'sa-tree is a new introduction
into N. 8. Wales, and as yet botanists have
no experience of its requirements. Probably
the late spring would be the best time to set
the seed. If planted young plants
would have to stand the winter.
(1) What is the meaning of tempera ?
How is it made and used? (2) Did all the
old masters paint in tempera? —2ooo.
(1) It is a method of painting in which
dry colors are mixed with a little water and
egg; sometimes the yolk only is used The
egg is to protect the pigment. When it dries
it changes chemically and becomes insoluble,
and thus a protection against the elements.
It is used to procure a special surface, and
has more solidity, depth and brilliance than
water-color, but not so much depth and
illusory quality as oil. (2) No.
I am a- Q’land postal clerk, 22 years of
age. I passed in nine subjects in the Q’land
University junior examinations several years
ago. How could I get a laboratory position
in connection with electricity, mining or
analytical chemistry ?— 2058.
You are barred from the electrical and
mining spheres by legislation imposing
apprenticeship conditions. There is no

llow to drill and tap exceptionally hard
cast steel wheels for grease cups? —ls6B.
The hardness is probably due to a chilled
surface. Try spot grinding the area where
the grease cup is to be fitted, or locally heat
the spot with oxyacetylene flame to soften
the skin. If the steel is hard all through the
only course is to fully anneal the wheel.
What is the story of the “Black Hole of
Calcutta”? —2015.
In 1756 Suraj-ud-Dowlah, the 19-year-old
Nawab of Bengal, marched upon Calcutta
with a large army. The Europeans, under
John Zephaniah Ilolwell, were compelled to
surrender. To the number of 146 they were
forced into the guardroom of Fort William, a
chamber measuring only 18ft. by 14ft. 10in.,
with but two small barred windows, where
they were left for the night. It was June 20;
the heat was intense; and next morning only
23 were taken out alive, among them Ilolwell,
who wrote an account of the awful suffer-
ings endured.
llow did William Buckley, the escaped
convict who lived 32 years among the Port
Phillip blacks, spend his later years? —2o2l.
After receiving a pardon in 1835 he was
for a time employed by the Port Phillip
Association as go-between with the natives.
When Lonsdale reached Port Phillip as sup-
erintendent at the end of Sept., 1836, he—
being a captain in the 4th Regiment, in which
Buckley had served—at Governor Bourke’s
suggestion, made him constable and inter-
preter to the aborigines. In 1837 Buckley
went to Tasmania, where the Government
gave him small billets—assistant storekeeper
at the immigrants’ home, gatekeeper at the
female penitentiary—and in 1852 retired him
on a pension of £l2 p.a., which the Vic.
Government later made up to £1 per week.
He gave John Morgan the materials for the
book “The Life and Adventures of William
Buckley.” Early in 1856 Buckley was
thrown out of a cart and died" of his injuries.

(1) Not unlikely, since ribbon-fish swim
with an undulating movement and their
backs are provided with a fin that extends
along the whole length and commonly forms
a crest on the head. (2) Their bodies,
which' are flat, sometimes reach a length of
over 20ft. They are covered with a delicate
silvery skin which is beset with small bony
tubercles, and their fins are formed of long
and slender rays. They are very fragile
and probably live in the depths, as they
are usually more ofl less helpless when
observed swimming near the surface of the
sea.
(1) Why did M.L. abolish provincial
governments? (2) What became of Julius
Vogel’s proposal to reserve to the Crown-

(1) Principally because the land sales of
the provincial governments resulted m
economic disaster to the colony, in addition
to which the cost of 11 administrations in
a country with a population of 306,000 was
felt to be excessive. (2) Largely owing to the
opposition of a provincialist majority in
Parliament, Vogel had to abandon this pro-
posal.

Synopsis : The story opens in 1905
in the small town of Banton, H. 8.
Wales, west of the Blue Mountains,
where Dr. Gherardi, an Italian poli-
tical exile, has settled with his wife
and son, and is establishing a prac-
tice. He is troubled by the fret-
fulness of his wife, who accom-
panied him to Banton against his
wish, but who now, he feels, is making
no effort to adapt herself to his cir-
cumstances. Allegations touching upon
his professional performance and other
misunderstandings make him deter-
mined to leave, but impes'ceptible influ-
ences work to keep him there. He has
made a friend of John Cartwright,
Banton’s leading citizen, and is slowly
winning the respect and friendship of
others. But Mrs. Gherardi becomes
more and more intent upon returning
to Italy, and at last, when their house
is burnt down, wins Dr. Gherardi’s
agreement that they should go. Going
to the bank after the fire, Dr. Gherardi
is made to see Banton’s people in a
new light—they have anonymously sub-
scribed £3OO as a token of appreciation
of his work and sympathy in his loss.
He feels that he cannot go note, and
rejects Mrs. Gherardi’s suggestion that
he should return the gift; since he
regards it as a tie. Mrs. Gherardi
becomes more and more fretful, and
there is a bitter scene between them
just as he sets out for the Ferrars’s
farm, where Michael Ferrars is seri-
ously ill from drink. The doctor is
touched by the tragedy and person-
ability of Mrs. Ferrars, but can do no-
thing for the husband.
Chapter VI {Continued).
FERRARS accepted the presence of a
doctor without comment and made no
demur at being examined. He answered
irritably such questions as were put to him,
and occasionally a frown or pain contracted
his sallow, muddy face.
At last Leo said: “Of course you know
what is your trouble.”
The- man raised his weary eyelids. Un-
utterable boredom showed for an instant
in his dull eyes.
“I do. You can save yourself the bother'
of telling me.”
“Very well, then!” said Leo sharply.
“You know, too, that unless you give up
drinking you will die.”
Not the faintest quiver disturbed the
yellow face.
“Man, have you no decency? Think of
your wife. Could you not make some effort
for her sake? If you can build up your
will power again you can get right. I could
arrange for you to go to some sanatorium.”
“We won’t go into that, Doctor. If you’ve
got anything on you that’ll make me feel
less foul than I do at the moment, let’s
have it. I won’t trouble you further.”
He turned his face to the wall and there-
after was deaf to Leo’s persuasions.
Pale with fury Leo walked from the room.
The woman was standing at a mantel-
piece, her head lowered on her arm. She
straightened as Leo came into the room.
“Well, Doctor?” she said.
“I’m afraid I can do very little, Mrs.
Ferrars.” She bowed her head slightly.
“Your husband has obstinacy common in
men who drink. But if you need my help
at any time, do not hesitate to call me. I
will be pleased to do what I can.”
Suddenly he found that the woman’s eyes
had filled with tears; they were like two
pools of sea water when the sky is hung
with clouds.
“I don’t know why, but I thought you
would do something for him. I hoped”
Her tears embarrassed him. He plunged
into the giving of directions for Michael’s
treatment, and when the merest minute
of the subject had been exhausted he said
hesitantly, “Perhaps if you were to tell me
a little about yourself I might be able to
help you.”
“I don’t know that anyone can help me,
Doctor, except myself. But I don’t know
—it helped when you understood me. I
suppose you have to listen to a lot of this.
Stories like mine can’t be very new to you.”
“There are few who have not stories
to tell,” he countered. “Stories pretty
similar. Stories of defeat. Often they tell
to me. It is, you might say, the penalty
of my profession.” He noticed the sudden
tautening of her body, the veil of reserve
which clouded her face. “I say penalty,”
he continued gravely, “because knowledge
of suffering of one’s fellow beings is a
bqrden to carry. But one helps sometimes.
Even if it is only by sharing the knowledge
of suffering.”
“Yes. I can see that. I’ve bottled it up,
pretended—even when I knew everyone
knew. 1....1’ve been so ashamed. So
ashamed!”
“Would you feel shame if your husband
had some disease, tuberculosis, cancer? No,
you wouldn’t feel shame. Only pity. Why
don’t you think of it like that? It is
disease, just the same.... You have no
children?”
She shook her head. “I’ve been spared
that, thank God. At first I was very.un-
happy about it, but afterwards, when I
found how things were, I was glad. Glad.”
Her emphasis was savage. She was silent
for a moment, then added more quietly,
“Though it hurts too. I’m terribly fond of
children. I was thinking more of that part
of marriage than anything I think, when I
married.”
“You knew your husband’s weakness when
you married him?”
“Yes, I knew, I suppose. Not properly.
But I wasn’t very happy. I was living with
my aunt, Mrs. Brelling. When my father
died she took me in. There wasn’t any
money my father was one of the Gil-
berts. You might have heard of my grand-
father. Father was his youngest son. He
got a share of the property, of course, but
he—well he hadn’t much idea of money.
When he died my relations were very kind.
They decided that I should go to Aunt
Margaret and they would all contribute
towards my support. I was terribly humili-
ated even then, though I was only a child,
and later on I hated the thought that I
was dependent on my relations. I’d run
the home, for dad ever since mother died.
1.... a home was necessary to me, Doctor.
Some women are like that. Making a
home seemed the only thing I was any
good at.”
Her face grew soft, and Leo felt that she
must have loved her scapegrace father
dearly.
She fell silent, and resumed with an air
slightly absent, as if her mind had been
distracted: “In my aunt’s house I felt a
sort of of interloper. So when Michael
came along—l was lonely and he was
someone to look after and help and make
a home for. His father had died and left
him this property. It was heavily mort-
gaged, but we had a good chance of doing
we 11.... You see, mine’s a very common-
place story, Doctor.”
Her half-smile hurt him. “Sometimes
the commonpla.ce tragedy is most tragic
of all. It depends on the nature which
endures it.”
She regarded him with shy pleasure. “I
don’t often get a chance to talk, Doctor
.... about things that are important,” she
said haltingly.
Leo, relaxed in the cushioned armchair,
perceived beyond this tentatively lifted
corner of the veil the woman’s mind, a
rich and fertile wilderness which with cul-
tivation could yield a rare blossoming. It
seemed a pity—a mind and a beautiful body
and self-control unusual in a woman. And
this life was linked to the hulk in the bed
there! Well it was none of his business.
She sensed his desire to be gone and
added hurriedly; “Well, I mustn’t keep you
any longer. But I wish you’d let me give
you some tea—or a drink.”
“Thanks. You are very kind. But I do
not wish anything. I will see that the medi-
cine goes on the mail. You remember what
I have told you? And don’t worry too
much. And remember to send for me at any
time. Good-bye, Mrs. Ferrars.”
She stared after the buggy until it was
out of sight, then went drearily into the
the house.
As the miles unwound the shifting haze of
paddocks and trees, fallow and grazing
stock, he grew unaccountably depressed.
(4)
Teresa put on the new blue linen frock,
which was one of the few she had bought
after the fire, and until now had not worn.
The color was vivid and accentuated the
sallowness of her face. Her deeply-ringed
sunken eyes gazing back at her from the
mirror were rather terrifying.
“I have become very ugly,” she said
aloud. She brushed her hair, but her
energy could not bring back the lustre
stolen by weeks of neglect. She dusted the
dining-room carefully. There were no
flowers in the garden, so she picked a
branch of the green pepper-tree; but flower
containers had been overlooked by Leo in
his purchasing, so she placed the branch in
a glass and propped it against the mantel-
back.
If he knew how hard it was, he would be
kind, she thought dully. It was so difficult
to think, so difficult to drive one’s mind and
lash one’s tired body to the doing of those
things that must be done. Hands and feet,
body and mind seemed chained with enor-
mous chains. Several times lately she had
found herself cowering against a wall, press-
ing her head there, trying to merge herself
into that imagined darkness, to touch the
lowest pit of misery. But she was going to
please Leo this afternoon; poor, lost Leo!
She ran out to the verandah, and stood
looking down the road, the empty road
winding up over the hill which on one side
was red and gashed. It was wise to look at
things like that! Looking at the road
calmed her. She hoped he would notice
that she was feeling better, looking brighter.
One must not let him know anything of the
depths tugging at one’s feet. It would only
hurt him. And he might prevent you if the
time came when you should want to go
down, and find peace.
Leo opened the gate and came slowly up
the oath.
“How are things?” he inquired listlessly.
“Has anyone asked for me?”
He listened with downbent head while
Teresa gave him details of the day’s
appointments, then went into the house.
She gazed after him, the expression on her
face that of a beaten dog, who knows no
cause, but only knows its hurt. Lost Leo!
Lost Teresa!
When she was quite sure that she was
not going to cry, she, too, went inside. It
was almost easy to control one’s tears these
days, possibly because one had so few tears
left.
At the dinner-table Leo said, casually, not
weighing the effect of his words: “You could
put a few flowers in the room sometimes,
couldn’t you? The place seems very bare,
Teresa. I don’t know much about these
matters. I bought only necessary furni-
ture, but there is money enough now for
us to have a few pretty things to make
the house comfortable. When we move into
the new house we will furnish it well.”
She. made no reply and the subject was
dropped.
That night, as he was searching in a
drawer for a mislaid journal, he discovered a
pile of unopened letters and papers. His
face was grim as he accused Teresa.
“Why did you not give these to me?
Why have you hidden them? This letter
from Alfredo must have come about two
months ago! What is the meaning of it,
Teresa?”
“I waited until you should ask for them.
I wanted to see how much you cared. Leo.
you haven’t noticed that we’ve had no
mail! You seem to have forgotten that
there is any world outside Eanton. Be-
cause I haven’t urged you lately, you
haven’t written home.” Her faltering voice
broke.
The reproach in her eyes and her words
were as a match laid to the tindery accu-
mulation of the afternoon’s depression.
“If you did the same thing we would
both be happier! This town is not such a
bad place. You would find that out if
you made the least effort to adjust your-
self. Really, I wish I’d never brought you
here. Our marriage was a mistake ; I realise
it more and more every day.”
Swirling in the flood of his anger he failed
to notice the effect his words had on her,
that she cowered before him as one struck,
and covered her face with her hands.
“I’m cruel to tell you this, you think.
But I’ve tried tenderness and sympathy
and you take no notice, make no effort.
You make me tired with your brooding and
your incessant air of accusation. To-day I
have seen a woman, in circumstances far
worse than yours, a beautiful girl with
mentality far above the average, married to
a confirmed drunkard. She lives alone with
him in a shanty miles out in the bush. She
does not love him. Her life is hell. But
she has courage. She is trying to make a
decent life for herself. She can rise superior
to circumstances. Teresa, when I look at
you I feel ashamed that you are my wife!”
She took her hands from her face, which
was deathly pale. Her eyes glowed like
two live coals.
“I’m sorry, Leo, that you feel this.” She
breathed with difficulty. “My reproaches
were made because I loved you and be-
lieved in you. I thought you could be, and
should be, a great man, and that I could
help you, because there is weakness in you.
I knew that. You have a faculty for adap-
tation of which you are a little proud. But
it is a fatal thing to one in your position—
no, let me finish, please, please Leo!” She
trembled with entreaty as he made to turn
away impatiently. “I gave up everything
that meant life to me to follow you, and I
submitted willingly as long as I saw that
submission was the right thing. But the
time has passed for that. You must make
a move, if you are ever to do anything.
You should have made it long ago, and my
unhappiness has been through this. I’ve
loved you very much, Leo—more than
you’ve loved me. I’d do anything to help
you—to help you be what you could be.
But I won’t help you to destroy yourself.
Leo, give me some hope! Tell me”
She put her hands uncertainly towards him,
but he made no move.
A faint consciousness of his unfairness
penetrated his anger, and in denying it he
lashed himself to excesses.
“That is what you say —for me! All
this has been for my sake! Well, if you
think you’ll succeed in getting me away
from here before I’m ready to go, you’re
mistaken.”
The agony of her face halted him; he
felt intense and blinding shame.
“Teresa,” he said uncertainly; but with
an arm crooked against her face, like a
child, she had stumbled from the room.
He lay awake long that night tossing in
his narrow bed.
At breakfast he told her amiably that he
had been asked to go on the School of Arts
committee. What did she think of the
idea?
Teresa poured his coffee and said that she
did not think it necessary to link himself
with the town in such a way.
“Well, we must live here, you know,” he
said without thought.
“Yes, it seems that we must live here.’ 1
Her voice was curiously lifeless.
Intent on being agreeable he did not
notice the peculiar quality of her com-
posure.

Leo had said to her, coming into her
room where she lay resting, after the mid-
day meal, “I’ve seen Boulton. He says the
house will be finished by the end of the
month. It will be good to get out of this
hovel, Teresa. You know, we could have
done worse than come to this town. There
is money to be made here; and the people
are very kind once you get to understand
them. I told you they were doing up the


ceilings at the hospital? I’ll transform that
place in time. I’ve learned one must go
cautiously—let the committee feel that
the ideas for improvement originate with
them. If I’d had a little more diplomacy
as a young man things might have been
different. But no use thinking about that.
I’ll be about two hours. If anyone calls you
wall find me at the hospital.”
At his words, no more or less than he
had said many times, something snapped
in Teresa’s brain. The last feeble barrier
which her will had opposed to events
crumbled. She gave no outward sign, but
lay gazing at him, her eyes fixed and glassy.
. He left the room, and then she moved as
a sleep-walker might move.
She listened, kneeling on the bed, with
her hands closed round the rail, for the
sound of her husband’s footsteps; came the
slam of the door, a few strides, and he was
crunching down the gravel path; the click
of the gate, then the even thud, thud, on
the hard footpath, growing fainter until all
sound died aw r ay. Then she got off the bed
and went across to the window.
Summer was over. The earth, the sky
were wan; they seemed to have been
drained of color and vitality, and, now that
the end of the trial had come, lay listless,
comatose, scarcely aware of survival.
Teresa raised the window-blind higher.
A flock of sparrows soared and planed inde-
terminately. They were aimless, light as bits
of burnt paper blown through the pallid
blue. There was little traffic on the dusty
road. A water-cart drawn by a plodding
horse went by with clanking rattle of loose
wheels; a boy on a bicycle with a bag tied
to his handle-bars coasted joyously down
the hill; a black horse sweated and dragged
a tip-dray full of shale, wondering perhaps
as it commenced to climb why its burden
should have grown so suddenly intolerable.
Teresa dropped the blind and stood in the
darkened room, pressing her hand to her
breast. He had said he would be about two
hours, not longer, if anyone should call.
Two hours. Strange that one was not
afraid. And yet not strange. To fear
death one must value life. Why should
she fear? She had died this death many
times in the last two months. She knew
all about it. There was no uncertainty left
now. They had talked of it many times—
she and the child!
Her eyes lost their glassiness, grew soft
and beautiful.
“We are not afraid, my baby, my little
one?” she crooned gently. For two months
she had been conscious of the child beneath
her heart. One day, returning from an
habitual solitary walk, she had passed the
house which was being built for them. She
had watched the work for some time, until
one of the men, noticing her, had asked
whether she cared for a closer view. She
had said no, and gone away. She had
felt during the half-hour of watching a ter-
rible sense of impotency and of fear—had
thought of a condemned man forced to wit-
ness the building of his own coffin.
That evening she had first felt sure
that she was going to have another child.
The knowledge was poignant, exquisite. All
the long, hot night she had lain awake
savoring her rapture. The loneliness of her
imprisonment no longer dragged at her
spirit, which was ecstatically companioned.
Once she had heard Leo get up and
walk to the edge of the verandah, then
heard the creak of the stretcher as he
returned to it. She had started up jealously,
then crouched back in the bed, pressing her
arms across her body, as though to bar in
the precious thing. “Mine—all mine,” she
had thought with savage joy. “They have
taken everything from me, but they cannot
take this!” The blessed Mother of God
had had compassion. “Listen, my baby,”
she had whispered softly, so softly, and had
told the little one many things. How they
were in an alien country, in a town of
strange voices, and eyes which looked on
things to which she was blind, finding happi-
ness in gazing on things she could not even
see. She told the child about herself, its
mother, of the music she loved, and the things
she had been going to do, told it about those
long-ago days in Bologna. She told it
about the new house which was being built
and how hateful it was. Then, after a time,
she told of the women in the town and how
she had tried every way to find the key
which would unlock the door to friendship,
but had never succeeded. “They are kind
enough, but they are different, my little
daughter.” She had known from the first
minute that the child was a girl, daughter,
sister, all the women she had ever loved,
companion of her own sex, with the under-
standing of her own sex.
When morning came palely into the room
she had wondered at the swift passing of
the night, and said: “We must sleep now,
little one.” And she had fallen asleep hap-
pily.
Next day she had not told Leo of the
child’s coming. The spell of the night’s
exquisite communion was over her. She
felt that the sharing of her secret even
with her husband would take away the new
sense of completion. Almost without con-
scious thought, she drifted along in her
secrecy. A week had gone by and she had
not told him. “Why should I?” she had
thought jealously. “She is mine—all mine.
I need her. He does not need her. He has
so many things. I have only this.”
Her eyes lost their heavy brooding look,
so that Leo, who had been kinder since the
night when he had abused her, was com-
forted and felt that she was really settling
down at last, and that he need not have
such guilty fears for her happiness.
“You are feeling better these days,
Teresa?” he had asked once, and she had
answered with that air of secret joy: “Much
better. I am well now, Leo. My unhappi-
ness has gone.”
The imparting of her secret had trembled
on her tongue. She had felt suddenly that
she had been wrong to withhold the know-
ledge so long. Her dear Leo —whom she had
been treating as an invader! She thought
of the time when they had first known that
Dino was coming. It could be like that
again, even though they seemed to have
drifted so far from each other.
And Leo, thinking the hour propitious,
had tried to lure her into accompanying him
to a picnic which was being given by Julia
Simpson the following Sunday.
“It will do you so much good. These
people are really quite jolly in their way.
I enjoy myself, and so would you.”
His words, slight though they were, had
frozen her impulse. The town and the
people she hated encroached on every
moment of her life. He was always think-
ing about them—he had been mesmerised
by these trifling strangers. She had turned
away.
“I don’t want to go. I am quite content.”
He had not persisted, so used had he be-
come to her abstentions.
Then one morning the sweet cloud had
lifted from her reason and she ]iad realised
the folly of her illusion. She had sent Dino
off to school. Leo had been summoned to
the hospital. She stood on the verandah
watching her son tramping steadily down
the road, his school-bag swung on his back.
With a sudden agonising pull the veil was
torn from her eyes.
She had lived for the present and forgot-
ten the future: What folly! In a few
months, in a moment, the child would be
gone from her. Life would take this from
her as it had taken all else. One day she
would see this other self, this love, tramp
down the road away from her. The town
would take it as it had taken Leo, taken
Dino—even more completely. Soon she
would be alone again. As long as they
stayed here she must walk in loneliness.
She had gone into the house, and walked
up and down the narrow hall; sometimes
stopping and pounding her head with her
clenched fists. She had thought of Leo, her
husband whom she loved. What would the
child mean to him? Possibly—one must be
honest—it would be an added burden. It
would hinder his departure. No, not a
burden. An excuse. He would be glad of
the child, because it would be an excuse for
remaining longer in the town.
She could not have told just when the
idea of leaving life had occurred to her, but
had found that she was thinking of it as
if it were a thing debated for a long time;
it seemed so familiar and comprehensive,
the solution of all her difficulties. Often she
would pray, not to God, but to his Blessed
Mother; the Divine Mother whose Son had
been taken from her. She prayed a little
anxiously, but confidingly, because it seemed
that Mary the Sorrowful must understand.
Gradually her ideas had taken shape. One
day she had remembered a friend of hers,
a lovely young girl, who had been engaged
to be married. The mother of the girl had
died suddenly, and in dying had pleaded
with her daughter to give up marriage and
to enter the convent of St. Catherine. The
girl had done this. For a whole afternoon
Teresa had thought of this incident, associ-
ating it with herself, and had been power-
fully affected. Dying, she considered she
could influence Leo as living she could not.
But her spirit shrank. She banished the
idea—for that day. It lay, the merest
flicker in her consciousness, extinguished,
she thought. But it needed only a sudden
fanning to flame.
On that last day of summer, when the
earth lay scarce breathing and the with-
ered leaves fell slowly to the ground, a few
chance words fanned the spark.
“Don’t be afraid, little love,” she whis-
pered to the child, and it seemed to her
she felt tiny hands close trustingly round
her heart. “Don’t mind giving up life, my
baby. Life is very sorrowful.”
The house was very still. There was no
wind that day. She listened and the earth
seemed silent, as if dead. Unhurried, she
went into the surgery and took a tube of
strychnine tablets from a case. For a
moment the familiar odor of the room re-
called her to sanity. She looked up startled
from her reading of the tube label. The call
of known things reached her, like a thin
voice, faintly heard by a wanderer in dark
places. Her nostrils contracted. “Leo!” she
said, in a desperate whisper. But the mad-
ness drove her. The moment passed and
she went on.
Clutching the tube she went to the tele-
phone and asked to be connected with the
hospital.
Leo came.
“I wnnt you here. It is urgent, Leo. Will
you come now?”
He had been laughing before he came to
the ’phone. The mirth still lingered in his
voice as he answered.
“I’ll come now. In a few minutes.”
“You won’t delay too long. It is very
urgent, Leo.”
“No, I’ll come. Let them wait just a
minute.”
“Now. Now, Leo!”
But he had hung up the receiver. She
was sure that he would come.

AS WE SAID BEFORE
This page will be devoted week by week to reproductions of the
gems in picture, story and verse published in “The Bulletin” of last
century, so that pleasant memories may be revived in old readers and
a new generation may enjoy the things that delighted an earlier one.
There are some men who have no luck in
this world, and Gitardo Campani, of Lyell
(Tas.), was one of them. He was a navvy,
and when he was at work he jambed his
thumb on an average three times a day. He
tried to settle down in life, but his wife
always had “the gastralgia,” and her groan-
ings cast a blight over his humble home.
His liens went and laid in the next man’s
garden ; the small boy round the corner laid
for his small boy every time he went out,
and licked him in one round; and his cow
was always ill. These things made existence
a misery to Gitardo, and one day at the
beginning of December his woes reached such
a point that he felt he could endure them no
longer. His cow had stopped laying alto-
gether, and his hen had gone dry. One fly
more than his aching heart could endure had
slid into his beer ; the last straw had turned
up in the butter, and he resolved to die. So
he lay down in a secluded spot, placed a
great "block of dynamite on his chest and
hit it with a hammer. The funeral was of
an unostentatious character.
That fashionable institution the surprise
party has been voted a failure at Chump’s
Gully (N.S.W.), and the girls down there
conclude that there isn’t any fun in it.
Chump’s Gully is not a large place, but the
upper classes there are eminently genteel,
and the district has burst all its buttons in
the effort to keep pace with the moral, spiri-
tual and intellectual development of the age;
sd when the inhabitants heard that surprise
parties were all the go they resolved to have
one at once. But they made a mistake in
selecting Mr. Ebenezer H. Short as the party
to experiment on.
It was 8 p.m., and
Short, in desha-
bille, was engaged
soaking his pet
corn, and Mrs.
Short was sitting
by the fire in a
busted dressing-
gown with a red
flannel chest-pro-
tec t o r showing
through it, and tlxe
baby was being un-
dressed on the
table, when ten
young gentlemen
and as many ladies,
all tittering and
all carrying re-
freshments, knocked
loudly at the door.
Short uttered an
execration, and
hastily withdraw-
ing his corn from
the tub he stump-
ed to the keyhole
and spoke: “Now,
then, you lar-
rikins, run away
and play!” There
was loud laughter
at this and little
girlish shrieks, and
Short, getting ex-
cited, yelled: “If
yef don’t go away
I’ll throw the water over yer.” “P’raps
Short’s ’aving a bath in the kitchen,”
said a familiar voice outside, and Eben-
ezer, recognising it, rushed back into
the room and issued a dozen orders all at
once: “M’ria, gimme my boots, and get that
undressed infant out of the way, and chuck
this bucket out, and for heaven’s sake get
out of .sight yourself, for you’re all busting
through that yellow gown of yours, and it
won’t keep shut down the back, and tell the
children if they start making a row like
they did last night I’ll murder them.” Then
he opened the door, and the visitors trooped
in and covered the table, from which the
infant had been shifted, with cloaks and hats
and bread and butter and paper bags filled
with tarts, and goloshes and bottles of lemon-
ade, and told Short they had come to make
a night of it. Short replied that in that
case he would go and split some more wood
and keep the fire going, and presently he
was heard in the back yard saying excitedly:
“M’ria, them folks say they’ve come to stay
and we haven’t any candles,” to which the
lady responded in tears, “I came out here
thinking they wouldn’t stay a minute, and
now you’ll have to go in and throw my dress
out of the window or I’ll have to wait here
all night. Drat them vulgar surprise parties
anyhow!” Then the bank clerk who had
got up the entertainment said in an audible
aside: “I think we r d better give it up. Seems
to me Mrs. Short’s out in the yard, and
WHAT HE WAS PAID FOR.
“How much do you earn per day?”
"Fivah shillings.”
“What? Five shillings for playing the
organ?”
“No, fivah shillings for shut up and go
’way.” [25/2/88.]
can’t come in for want of something to put
on,” and Gie lady exclaimed in a hysterical
scream: “D’ye hear that young wretch? He’s
talking about my clothes!” The party broke
up in confusion at this point, and Short’s
baby was sick all next day through eating
the tarts they left behind in their retreat.
According to present signs there will never
be another surprise party at Chump’s Gully.
According to a large number of learned
geologists, Europe, west of the Rhine, is
steadily sinking into the sea, and if the pro-
cess only lasts long enough the strained rela-
tions between France and Germany will
ultimately adjust themselves by the disap-
pearance of one of the parties to the dispute
beneath the blue Atlantic. A congress of
erudite professors is now sitting on this
question at Salzburg, and the members have
accomplished a large number of elaborate cal-
culations to show how fast the unlucky
country is going down and where it is pro-
bably going to, but so far the researches of
the brainy gathering have resulted in no
coherent plan for holding up the collapsing
republic, and nobody had anything to suggest.
If France is sinking the congress can’t do
anything but stand aside and watch it sink,
and they intend to do that judiciously and
wait results. [29/12/’BB.]
Wine and women, cards, usurers and eels,
all are slippery, and the man who pins his
fortunes to any one of them generally spends
his closing years in carrying bricks up a
ladder with broken boots and a bashed hat.
Down in Victoria three children of Nature
recently bought the right to all the eels in
a huge swamp which was in process of
drainage, and paid cash for them. Then
they erected eel-traps in the cuttings, and
sent one of their party to reside in a swell
hotel in Melbourne that he might be on
hand to dispose of consignments, and hav-
ing made these arrangements they figured
up their profits with the calm confidence
which marks a man when he has invested
one-half his fortune in backing a horse with
four broken legs and a cough that shakes
his stable, and put the rest in a company
for extracting oily gammon out of old boots.
But weeks rolled on, and the drainage was
completed without even a baby eel coming
into the traps. The snaky varmints
remained quietly in the mud and wet grass,
and the despairing syndicate concluded they
would have to wade for them and take them
by hand. The chief capitalist himself went
in twice in a tail-coat, bell topper and cuffs,
and on the second trip he captured one frog,
after which he took rheumatic fever and
raved in bed for five weeks. Next a man,
who had been engaged at great expense,
hunted through the mud for nearly a month
—result, one eel. He took to lemonade
after this. Another member of the firm was
lost in the swamp, but a search party fished
for him with a pound of old cheese and a
bottle of whisky tied on a line, and at
length got a bite and hauled him out. Opera-
tions are at present suspended, the company
having stopped as short as if it had been
hit by a brick.
RATS.
We smuggled in the bag all right.
McPherson shut his cabin door.
When smoke and grog half-dimmed his sight
We let the rats loose on the floor,
ill painted white and pink and blue.
“Good God!” he shrieked, “you chaps—
look there!”
Right, left, and up and down they flew.
We stared, and calmly asked him “Where?”
He shifted in his seat, flushed red,
And bit his lip. Whilst all around
The din would have aroused the dead,
We swore we couldn’t hear a sound.
We raised our eyebrows as we spoke,
We shook our heads and took our hats.
He stammered —“It was all a joke,
You chaps! I never saw those rats!”

SPORTINO NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Waterline is not much to look at, being
almost as plain as the late Cragford, but
he is a galloper of class. This he proved in
Melbourne by his second in the Newmarket,
his victory (with lOst. 71b.) in a division
of the Bourke Handicap, and his defeat of
Phar Lap in the C. M. Lloyd Stakes; and it
was strange to see 2 to 1 offered in the
Rawson Stakes at Roseliill about a horse
capable of the last-mentioned achievement,
even though he had 211 b. the better of the
weights and the champion might have had
enough racing for the time —Phar Lap has
since been withdrawn from his Randwick
engagements. It was 5 to 2 Waterline here
and there, Veilmond being the opening
favorite at 6 to 4; at the close of operations
it was 7 to 4 Veilmond, 2 to 1 Waterline.
Thei'e was a lot of money for Balloon King
and a bit for Chide; none for Tregilla, the
other starter.
Balloon King cut out the pace and took
some running down. Waterline, who was
beautifully ridden by Pike, accomplished this
task between the leger and the public stand
in the paddock, and beat the plucky little
three-year-old by a length and a quarter;
Veilmond, finishing fast when Waterline's
win was assured, was. third, half a head away.
He had been on the rails most of the way,
and McCarten took him, very late, on the
outside; and there were acid remarks about
Mac’s jockeysliip. He is certainly no rival of
Pike, but the truth seems to be that Veilmond
is a fainthearted beggar who won’t do his
best unless he has things his own way. Trc-
gilla, who has not grown a bit since the
spring and has shown no form this autumn,
was fourth and Chide last. Treclare’s son
was foaled weeks later than the other three-
year-olds, his opponents, and perhaps his
severe spring campaign told on him; but his
trainer is said to have been satisfied with his

recent performances. The nine furlongs were
traversed in Imin. 54sec. —good time, for
the track was heavy.
Pike was seen in another artistic exhibition
of horsemanship on Casque d’Or (8 to 1) in
the Railway Handicap. Pavilion was a
5-to-4 favorite —the layers of doubles, who
would all be able to go fossicking if the
Sydney clubs went in for doubles totes, had
quoted 6 to 1 Pavilion and Troilus (Autumn
Handicap)—and she looked as fit as hands
could make her. But she dawdled a bit
at the barrier, and though she made a fast
run in the straight she never travelled like
a winner. Pike, judging his movement on
Casque d’Or to a nicety, got Mrs. Gollan's
horse home by a head from Lord Romeo (10
to 1), who was doing better than the black
over the last 20 or 30 yards; the well-
backed Sir Duninald, who is being “placed”
clumsily, was a close third, and Pavilion was
fourth. Casque d’Or is in the Doncaster with
Bst. Gib., 51b. less than on Saturday, but
may be bothered by the last furlong. The
time for the seven furlongs was lmin. 28scc.
Pike completed the treble —his first for
many years —on Temoin (6 to 4) in the
Three-and-four-year-old Handicap. Tren-
ette (10 to 1) nearly stole the race, but
Temoin settled her with a great effort, show-
ing gameness under pressure. H'e is a stable-
companion of Waterline, both being trained
by Adam Skirving for “S. A. Rawdon”; he
it was who cut out the running for Water-
line in the C. M. Lloyd Stakes and finished
a good third. With 81b. more than Casque
d’Or’s weight he covered his seven furlongs
4sec. faster, but in the meantime the track
had dried a bit. All the same, it was a
capital performance, and that good sportsman
his owner is fortunate to have two such
candidates for the Doncaster as Waterline,
who has 9st. 21b., and Temoin (7st.). Water-
line is favorite, but it is highly questionable
whether he c&u concede 301 b. to Teinom, who
is also a four-year-old. Like his stable-
companion, Temoin is no beauty, but hand-
some is as handsome does. Pie is by imported
Drake— lmputation, a mare than could stay
for a week.

There were only thirteen starters in the
Railway Handicap and only seven in the
Autumn Handicap—evidence that handicap
form in Sydney this season is poor. Troilus
(7 to 4) failed in the 12 furlongs race,
but he was badly interfered with, and the
stewards, blaming Webster, the rider of
First Acre, suspended him for a month.
Troilus managed to dead-heat with New
Sweet (14 to 1) for third place; Donald
(5 to 1) seemed home and dry when he dis-
posed. ofc .New Sweet, who had led into
the straight, but First Acre (8 to 1)
came along on the rails and cut him out
of it by half a length, the pair placed third
being two lengths away. First Acre is in
his ninth year; Donald in his tenth! The
Maorilander has 7st. 121 b. in the Sydney
Cup, and the Newcastle veteran Bst. 121 b.
Spearman, who was last four furlongs from
home and was fighting for the lead yithin
two furlongs, finished fourth. He is in the
Cup with 7st. 131 b., and although there may
be doubts about his stamina lie should surely
account for the two old fellows.
A little-known gelding called New King
(Flying King—Black Eyes) had a very easy
win in the Parramatta Mile, for which he
was well in the market at fives. Ring Boy
(7 to 2) and Greenbird (5 to 2) are good
welter horses, but New King made them look
cheap, and the others were strung out. New
King was ridden by Sharp, one of the jockeys
that came over recently from the pony
courses, and considered about the best of
them.

The Warwick Farm meeting on Saturday
will be a sort of dress ’ rehearsal for the
Easter racing at Randwick. Waterline meets
the three-year-olds (Brazenface and Carry
Oh excepted) on better terms than at Rose-
hill, so he should win the Chipping
Norton Stakes. Parkwood and Spearman
seem an attractive double for the Liverpool
Handicap and the Autumn Cup. The
Dimmer’s reappearance in the Cup will be
interesting—he i§, of course, well known on
Sydney tracks. Fancies: —
Farm Stakes: Sun Eagle; next, Sunlover.
Chipping Norton Stakes : Waterline ; next,
Chide.
Liverpool Handicap : Parkwood ; next, Tre-
vallion.
Autumn Cup: Spearman ; next, Troilus.
Cabramatta Handicap: Kilumirri, next,
Roley.

“Pakenham”: Adam Skirving has already
won a Doncaster for “S. A. Rawdon” —with
Broadsword in 1911. Blague’s victory in
the Newmarket Handicap of 1915 was highly
remunerative, but the stable made a really
rich haul over Broadsword. It may be a
happy coincidence that Waterline, like
Broadsword, was acquired in Maoriland. In
view of his defeat of Phar Lap at Fleming-
ton and his Rawson Stakes triumph last
Saturday, Waterline is entitled to higher
rank than Broadsword. “Rawdon Hill,” the
private establishment where Waterline has
been trained, near Dandenong, originally was
known as Orleigh Park. There it was that
P. T. Heywood prepared a host of great
performers before transferring his quarters

of the game, having handed on the torch of

“Amiens” (Perth) : I wish you would give
us remote readers an early selection for the
Doncaster and Sydney Cup. We like to
see The Bulletin’s tips, and it is rough on
us if they are published so late that we can’t
get them unless we send a special wire. I
backed your first pick in the Caulfield and
Melbourne Cups, Amounis and Phar Lap;
another double like that will do splendidly.
[At the moment this Page fancies Temoin for
the Doncaster and Spearman for the Sydney
Cup.]

“Hotham”: Victoria’s acceptance of the
tote has had unforeseen results. For years
women have been banned from betting on the
courses, though the rule was more honored
in breach than observance, a number of young
gentlemen earning a lucrative living as
liaison officers between the fair punters and
Ike Mcßagg. The regulations governing tote-
betting make no exception in the case of
women, and it is expected that they will
considerably assist revenue —on the dollar
machines at least. Indeed some of the
clubs are talking of getting permission
to instal special windows for the girls, as
in other States where the tote is in operation.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Before Billy Grime went to America four
years ago he beat Eddie Butcher for the
Australian welterweight championship. The
then triple-champion is not so vigorous now,
as Wally Hancock proved when the ill-
matched pair met at Leichhardt Stadium.
Grime, who regained the lightweight title by
beating Billy Jones in February, was down
in the first round, and again—for eight—in
the second. He managed to last the limit,
however. Hancock, on points. Hancock,
10.6|; Grime, 9.104.

The supposed scarcity of first-class fighting
talent caused Sydney Stadium to stage
another popular-priced programme on Satur-
day night. Each of the three 10-rounders
was exciting, but there were not 1000 spec-
tators. Frank Green (12.0) fought Bob
Thornton (11.0), for the fifth time, in the
main event and took a hiding stoically. The
contest was called a draw. Tich Heeney
(8.12) outpointed Jimmy Summers (8.12) in
the second bout, and Phil Sullivan (B.S)
stopped Billy Woods (10.0) in five rounds.
The Watermen
The 83rd Oxford-Cambridge boatrace,
rowed on the Thames on Saturday, saw the
Light Blues win by 34 lengths; they led
all the way. Time for the 44 miles was
19min. 26sec., one of the best for some
years. Oxford has not won since 1923. The
Cantabs’ score is now 42 to 40 by Oxford,
the 1877 race ending in a dead heat.
* * * *
“Hawthorne” : Headmasters of the schools
concerned in the annual boatraces on the
Yarra have issued an order postponing -the
holding of the races to the last Thursday
and Friday of the school term. This has
been done so that there may be “less inter-
ference with school work.” An admission
that that which was denied for years had
existence.

“Blade”: The N.S.W. rowing season,
which opened at Riverview regatta the other
day, when Sydney defeated Mosman in the
Challenge eights over a mile, will reach its
apogee in the association’s annual champion-
ship regatta on the Nepean River at Pen-
rith on March 28. Under ordinary circum-
stances the races for the titles would have
been rowed in December, but the cancella-
tion of the inter-State eights made it possible
for the State championship meeting to be car-
ried forward. The events down for decision are
the champion eights and sculls, the light-
weight sculls, maiden fours and lightweight-
maiden fours. For the first time in five years
Bob Pearce will be absent. J. R. Scott, Aus-
tralian champion, and Jelbert, Victorian
title-holder, who is now resident in N.S.W.,
will be competitors in the sculling event.

“Toowong Reach”: The Brisbane rowing
community was thrown into embarrassing
confusion at the Q.R.A. regatta, in which the
G.P.S. Old Boys’ crew retained its cham-
pionship of the river. There was a novice
fours’ event, and when a crew of young
females from the Brisbane Ladies’ R.C.
paddled out, spectators consulted their cards
and wondered was there visions about, for
there was no mention of the pets on the
programme. It was explained that the ladies
were to row in a she-championship event the
following week, and had begged permission
to take part with the men in a trial spin.
There was a deathly silence, and then Bris-
bane C. of E. Grammar earned a bad mark
with the girls by deciding to row for de
shore, brudder, and leave the other entrants
to have it out with the flappers. The latter
finished third in the half-mile spin, but what
they said about C. of E. has not been pub-
lished —yet.
# * ❖ ❖
“Shell”: Some definite news of Bob
Pearce’s movements has been received in
Australia, the champion having written ask-
ing that the Philadelphia Gold Cup won by
him at the Amsterdam Olympiad should be
forwarded to him, since he has been chal-
lenged to defend it by an unnamed American
sculler. Bob sails for England in May to
take part in the Diamond Sculls at Henley,
and a new boat built in Sydney by A. and 11.
Green, of Abbotsford, is already on its way
to await him in London. After the Diamonds,
Pearce returns to Canada, where he will be
available for the Australian Olympic team to
Los Angeles, if required. Under Olympic
rules, having once appeared as an Austra-
lian sculler he cannot represent any other
country.
The Ins and Outs
“Shrewsbury” : English cricket scribes are
again perturbed as to the future status of
Hammond. The Gloucestershire man who
was born in Kent married the daughter
of a wealthy Yorkshire manufacturer a
couple of years ago, and it was then freely
rumored that he would in future play the
game under the whitewash coat of an ama-
teur. Hammond has dourly refused to fall
in with these ideals, and it is announced
that he will play next season for the cheese
county on a strictly cash basis as hereto-
fore. As a matter of fact the status of the
modern cricket amateur is so little removed
from that of the declared professional that
the distinction hardly seems worth bothering
about.
* * * *
“Mulga”: It is often asserted that the
carefree type of cricket played in the country
districts is much more enjoyable and sub-
ject to more interesting variations than the
deadly-in-earnest stuff served up in the Test
and Sheffield games in the big cities. That
there is something in the contention a
recent happening at Young (N.S.W.) goes
to prove. In a local match one of the
players had a word to say about an umpire’s
decision. In subsequent police-court pro-
ceedings the ump. was fined for assaulting
the player, and the latter was also nailed for
having used naughty language to the official.
If something of the sort could be introduced
into metropolitan circles there would be
fewer demands for brighter cricket.
* * * *
“W. G. Snort” : The recent controversy in
England over the doctoring of cricket pitches
by groundsmen again draws attention to the
fact that a crying need in cricket lias been,
and always will be, a pitch unaffected by
weather conditions and of uniform quality
under all circumstances. There are. several,
preparations on the market which answer
the purpose perfectly, and we should not then
be faced with the anomaly of having to play
on a different type of wicket every time a
new ground is visited or the weather is
tricky, or see Test matches played, as in
South Africa to-day, alternately on grass and
concrete.
* * * *
“Hotham”: Ponsford can give Don Brad-
man a lead in other particulars besides those
quoted by “Fitzcray” (B. 21/1/’3l). lor
instance, Ponsford is the only batsman m the
world to have made two scores of over 400
in first-class cricket. Don has yet to beat
that. -He has also to equal Ponsford s feat
of knocking up a century for his State against
each of the other States, while he has not yet
got scores of over 200 against four other
States, as Trumper and Ponsford have done.
Ponsford shares with M. A. Noble the dis-
tinction of having made four successive cen-
turies in SheffieM matches. Bradman’s tally
is 3.
(Continued on page 32.)
The last of the European Rugby inter-
nationals was played on Saturday, Scotland
beating England by 28 to 19 at Edinburgh
before 75,000 spectators. This match carries
with it the Calcutta Cup, which thus re-
mains in the hands of the Haggis men.
* * * *
Harry Hopman, now to be accounted a
Victorian, made a clean sweep of the South
Australian tennis championships at Adel-
aide. He beat A. K. Quist in the singles
final in three straight sets. With Gerald
Patterson he then collected the doubles, and,
partnered with Mrs. O’Hara Wood, won the
mixed doubles. Great interest was taken in
Patterson’s return lo big tennis. He showed
good form, though Schlesinger and Gar Hone
ran Gerald and his partner to five sets, the
winners scoring only 39 games to 35.
“Bowen Bridge” : The Queensland football
season will officially open with the Rugby
Union’s kick-off on April 11. The Union
has made great strides since last season, and
its success in securing the Brisbane Cricket
Ground as its headquarters will be a tre-
mendous asset. The Rugby League, which
has healed its differences, is expecting a
good season, and both codes will probably
engage on the usual inter-State tilts against
N.S.W.
* # * *
“Snarleyow”: The passion for feminism
in sport has unending ramifications, the only
game into which the sex has not intruded,
so far as I know, being wrestling, though
I live in hope of seeing even that. Inter-
State contests of all descriptions are now
the rule, and the other day two teams of
girls from Queensland and N.S.W. respec-
tively made sporting history by meeting in
a series of vigoro matches in Sydney,
vigoro being a sort of bread-and-butter
cricket played with a wooden racquet and
a tennis ball. It does not seem to have
occurred to anyone that an inter-State-sock-
darning or button-sewing competition would
arouse intense enthusiasm among~tire “he-
males of the species, and would be much
more useful to the community than swim-
ming, running or rowing tourneys. Such a
contest might be followed by scrubbing
matches or cooking corroborees, to say no-
thing of a host of other possibilities.
Jfc *
“Splash” : Australian swimming times con-
tinue on the up-grade, especially among the
flappers. During the past few days Jean
Cocks put up a new Australian record for
women over the half-mile, being clocked at
12min. 30 l-ssec. The world’s best is
12min. 3 8-10 sec., so there is still some way
to go. In the 500 yards breast stroke, Claire
Dennis recorded 9min. 12sec., also an Aus-
tralian record. Among the lads, A. Hart, of
Technical High School, got over 220 yards,
for boys under 14, in 2min. 33 l-ssec., or
4 3-ssec. better than the senior record for
the distance held by Australian champion
Noel Ryan. All the above swims were done
in Sydney.
* « * *
“Mako” : Australian swimmers who have
been floating about on “endurance” tests in
various Sydney baths might note the perform-
ance of one Pedro Candiotti, an Argentino,
who recently put in 71 hours 55 minutes in
the water, having covered 211 miles down
the Parana River in that time, being helped,
presumably, by a fair current. Pedro had
desired to complete the journey to Buenos
Ayres, 310 miles in all, but liis mates in-
sisted on his calling it a day.

The Ins and Outs
“Exhibition” : When the team taken up by
Alan Ivippax to tour North and Central
Queensland arrived in Brisbane —it is prac-
tically an Australian Eleven —the absence
of Grimmett was remarked on. He had
been starred as one of the tourers, dividing
honors in that respect with Don Bradman.
The manager said he was “disgusted”
with Grimmett for retiring from the tour
at the last moment. The saturnine little
Maorilander was as dumb as a side of frozen
mutton when an Adelaide interviewer asked
him what was up. To the writer, himself
a litterateur of more or less note, the explana-
tion is simple. There is simply no room on
a safari of this kind for two rival authors.
Bradman had got a flying start on the trip,
and naturally his fellow-novelist felt that
“East, west, liame’s best” under the cir-
cumstances.
* * * *
“Wock”: The popularity of the West
Indians (B. 18/3/’3l) was well founded.
When in Sydney their fitness was well
looked after by a well-known physical-
culture firm. The man who had most to
do with them asked each of his clients for
a “snapshot” of himself as a memento. He
was staggered later when he received a
number of full panel photographs, all fully
autographed, from one of Sydney’s leading
studios. Ilis only regret is that he did
not ask for a cap or some similar memento.
Maybe, he would have received more suits of
clothes than he could have worn out in the
term of his natural life. As an act of grace-
ful courtesy the visitors’ action in this
respect would be hard to excel.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: Albert Bennett, a young-
ster from Port Kembla, who was given
a trial for N.S.W. against the West Indies,
has signed up to play professional cricket
with St. Helens, Lancs. Fast-bowler Constan-
tine, himself a professional with the Nelson
club in the same county, was the chief mover
in the deal. Bennett is Lancashire born,
and should have less difficulty in settling
down under the new conditions. He is looked
on by some judges as a most promising bats-
man and slow bowler, but made an indif-
ferent showing when the chance was given
him against the West Indians, being parti-
cularly sluggish in the field, while he did
little with bat or ball.
* * * *
“Old Q.”: At last Brisbane Grammar
School is to' have a turf wicket. For long
it has stood alone among schools of the kind
in Australia in respect of its abominable
cricket ground, with the result that few
of the pupils have ever figured pro-
minently in inter-State cricket. With foot-
ball, exactly the reverse has been the case,
many an inter-State and international player
having been broken in on the flinty-surfaced
corner of Victoria Park. Over £6OO has been
raised by past and present scholars, while
the trustees are guaranteeing another £750.
The Government will also lend a hand under
the relief labor scheme.
* * *
“Der Jong”: The English tour of South
Africa does not seem to have revealed any
new talent among the tourists, if wicket-
keeper Farrimond be excepted. Hammond
and Hendren are still the mainstays of the
batting, which showed a very marked tail.
Hammond proved a useful bowler in the
Tests, but left-hander Voce had the biggest
bag of wickets with 28. Peebles also proved
difficult, but Maurice Tate seems to have lost
his old ginger, taking only 14 wickets at
considerable cost. Peebles and Voce already
pick themselves for the next English team
in Australia, when the veteran Patsy Hen-
dren will also be somewhere handy.
Racquet and Bawl
“Glenelg” : Though without the services of
D. Turnbull, now on his way to Hawaii,
South Australia won the inter-State match
with* a strong Victorian team by 14 rub-
bers to 7. The women’s section saw Vic-
toria triumphant by 8 rubbers to 4, though
the defeat of Mrs. O’Hara Wood by the local
Miss Weston was a feather in the South
Australian cap, especially as the Victorian
had defeated the S.A. champion, Kitty le
Mesurier. Quist, “Gar” Hone and Shepherd
did good work for the Wheatfielders, while
Schlesinger was the backbone of the Vic-
torian team.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: It seems pretty definite now
that Australia will not see Tilden’s team
this year. The Australian tennis authori-
ties have not so far been able to get an
answer to their invitation, and William
seems to have so many irons in the fire that
it is probable he will have little time for
world touring in the near future. Gerald
Patterson, however, will be in America on
business in June, and he is to act as an
ambassador in an attempt to tie Long Bill
down to a touring contract.
❖ jJC * jfc #
“Top Spin”: America, which, as the
winner of the Davis Cup on several, occasions,
should be fairly well acquainted with tennis
history, falls occasionally into some astonish-
ing bloomers. An article in a Chicago paper
contains the statement that the International
Tennis Federation was organised to see that
the game was played everywhere with a
standard ball and a court of the proper
dimensions. The only change the writer
can remember as regards the court dimen-
sions was the altering of the original “hour-
glass” shape of the court to the parallelo-
gram with which we are all familiar to-day.
That happened some time in the late 1870’s,
as the writer recalls it. In those days the
uncovered rubber ball was often seen in
unimportant play. This has long vanished,
though in the early days of the game in
Japan—a generation ago—-it was still in
use. The covered ball and the modern court
were the general rule long before the Federa-
tion was thought of.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Sandringham”: There can be no cavilling
at the success of Rufus Stewart, the burly
South Australian golf professional, in the
tourney for the Spalding Cup, with its accom-
panying trip to Britain for the open cham-
pionship, plus a liberal allowance for
expenses. For some years past the Ivooyonga
professional has been one of Australia’s out-
standing golf personalities, having won both
the professional and open championships. He
has already paid one visit “to Britain for the
big event, so will have the benefit of his
former experience to back his golfing ability.
Naismith, the Victorian who ran into second
place, is only 22. He showed consistently
good form in the State selection matches and
throughout the eliminating rounds for the
cup.
* * * *
“Brassey”: A unique golf-course is that to
be opened next month by the Woollahra
Municipal Council. It is a nine-hole show,
alongside Royal Sydney’s links at Rose
Bay, and covers the site of some old
Chinese market-gardens. Unlike others of
its kind it is reserved for ratepayers and
residents of the municipality only. The
annual fee will be only two shillings. Mem-
bers will be given a non-transferable identifi-
cation disc, and may not introduce more than
four visitors a year. The length of the
course is 1583 yards, and the man in charge
is the well-known C. E. Barnes, for over 10
years professional to the Wentworth Falls
club.
“The McHaggis”: Holing out in one may
for a moment bathe a player in the limelight,
but it has its drawbacks, one of which, the
custom which demands that all those into
the clubhouse shall drink at the hero’s ex-
pense, is by no means popular—among the
heroes, that is. In passing, the curious fact
may be noted that no case of holing out in
one has ever been reported from Scotland.
Another way of celebrating the feat has been
added in Britain. Club- and ball-makers
have been seizing the opportunity to adver-
tise their goods, and players who declare
they have done the feat with a Blinker
ball or a Blanky driver are apt to have
little presents passed them by the “trade.”
Things have got so hot lately that the British
Golf Union has ordered all clubs affiliated
to put a stop to the practice, which promises
a lot more work for harassed committees.
•J*
“Steel Shaft”: Victorian pennant golf
this year will be decided by match play, the
system of scoring by aces being abandoned.
Teams of seven will play all matches to a
finish if necessary, and the senior clubs may
also enter a junior team. Northern, after
winning the junior section for the past two
years, joins the seniors. It has some fine
young players, whose golf should benefit
from the experience gained by meeting the
stars of the big clubs.
* * * *
“Woogaroo”: Goodna, where Queensland’s
greatest mental hospital is situated, boasts
one of the finest golf courses in the State.
The milder cases in the hospital are allowed
the free run of the place. Arthur Moore
was playing a round with a friend when an
individual, who had been following the pair,
suddenly asked the Downs man what his
name was and what he did for a
living. Moore told him that he was Queens-
land’s Premier. His new acquaintance spat
reflectively. “Well, y’ might get away with
it,” he said ; “but I dunno. W’en they sent
me down here I told ’em I was Don Brad-
man, but th’ cows wouldn’t believe me.”
Car and Cycle
“Whizz” : Malcolm Campbell told an inter-
viewer in England the other day that he fully
expected the Australians Smith and Ilark-
ness to beat his world’s speed record when
the pair make their attempt on the Maori-
land Ninety-mile Beach. If they do, Camp-
bell intends to pack up his ponderous jigger
and hop out for M.L. to put up new figures
on the same beach. Campbell says his car,
now at Buenos Ayres exhibition, still has a
few miles in reserve; she was not all out
at Daytona.
$ $
“Coleur”: “Charley’s Mount” is slightly
mixed as to the finish of the Monte Carlo
Rally (B. 18/3/’3l). S. 11. Davies finished
first, but ultimate honors went to D.
McHealy, who started from Stavanger, in
Norway. In the small-car class another
Briton, V. E. Leverett, came out on top.
Generally British cars and drivers had it
all their own way, though Mme. de Jeanne,
of France, was third in the small cars, driv-
ing the French Austin 7,- which is known
as the Rosengart. The schedule called for
an average speed of 22 m.p.h. for cars under
1100-e.c. capacity and 25 m.p.h. for those
over, a rate which left mighty little time
for adjustments, repairs, food and rest.
❖ ❖ ❖
“Hotham” : Reference to the Monte Carlo
Rally (B. 18/3/’3l) reminds me that a
year or two ago someone suggested that a
similar contest be held, with Cup-time Mel-
bourne as the rendezvous. Yarratown is
almost a central position as regards . the
other Australian States, being 2100 miles
from Townsville in N.Q., 2342 from Perth
and 3462 from Darwin, via Sydney. As a
reliability test such a run would be of great
interest, while competitors would have the
races to refresh themselves at after their
labors. Failing Melbourne, what about
Sydney when the Bridge is officially opened.
sjc :{c #
“Kick Starter”: The action of the Aus-
tralian motor-cycle heads in delaying the
selection of the Australian representatives
for the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy race
for so long has seriously handicapped then-
chances. The invitation was received over
two months ago, yet officialdom has wasted
all that time in messing about until the
last minute. Even if the two men leave im-
mediately they cannot reach England before
the first week in May. They will then
have to arrange about their mounts and
have them conditioned by June 1, when
the difficult course is open for practice;
the first race takes place on June 10,
Canada, Maoriland and South Africa will
all be represented, and it is a pity our men
should have been so handicapped by official
casual ness.
* * * *
“Chev.” The unveiling of a commemora-
tive tablet to J. B. Dunlop in Belfast re-
cently was the occasion for much
reminiscing. The first pneumatic tyres were
boycotted by cycle-makers and dealers, so
Dunlop and his son had to manufacture then-
own machines to demonstrate the advantages
of the invention. Roars of laughter greeted
the first appearance of the tyre on English
racing tracks, but its users ran away
with so many events that manufacturers
soon found it an indispensable, equipment.
The first road vehicles to adopt pneumatic
tyres were the Irish jaunting-cars. To-day
650,000 motor vehicles run on them in Aus-
tralia alone.
Miscellaneous
“Spinner”: Big-game fishing, which has
so advertised other parts of the world, has
long been neglected by Australians save for
a few private individuals devoted to their
hobby. Yet the sea that washes our North
Australian coasts teems with many surface-
feeding big-game fish, including the mako
shark. Zanc Grey is to give our waters a
trial during a yachting tour round the world.
He will go northward from Fremantle, “work-
ing” the Westralian coast, especially at Shark
Bay, and thence round the. north of the
continent down to Brisbane, inside the Bar-
rier. He is to write a book about it all
later, and will have something worth writing
about.
* * *
“Third Base” : Hard times or no, the Aus-
tralian baseball heads are determined to get
a team of Japanese players for the coming
season, and cables are being exchanged with
Kieou University, which fields one of the
strongest sides in Nippon. Much contact
with first-class American teams and training
under American coaches have made the Jap-
anese adepts at the game, and the odds are
they would be too strong for the best we can
produce in Australia. As the manager of
the Stanford University side said when the
Americans were in Australia, the material
available is excellent, but knowledge of the
game as played in first-class company is non-
existent.
* 'l' ❖
“Blue Chalk” : The announcement that a
billiard-room for women only has been
opened in Liverpool suggests many interest-
ing possibilities. In the past a lady player
desiring to take a shot well up* the table
without “the rest” has been considerably han-
dicapped in a mixed assemblage. With the
exception of golf there is no game more
trying to the temper of the average player
than billiards, and here again the sex has
had to cope with an enervating restraint.
In the new establishment a girl whose oppo-
nent lias potted her ball to go out can
pull her rival’s hair to her heart’s content, el-
even whang the cat over the head with the
quarter-butt, and none shall say her nay.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Whoever sent out the invitations to the
Government House party to the Baden-
Powells was not named Noah. For tales
were told of husbands invited and wives left
out. Some of the men rang up and asked
the diplomatic equivalent of “Whaffor?” and
others took the bull by the horns and sen-
sibly accepted for their wives as well as
for themselves. When the night came
all the usual husbands turned up with
the usual wives; but some of the
reunions took place after dinner, one
member of the family having been in-
vited to the greater, the other to the lesser
function. The reception was one of those
quick-lunch affairs. The guest was bidden
for 8.45, and instructions on the card read
“Cars 10.15.” Many a suburban hostess
will long to_ define the length of her
party as concisely as that, for some guests
really are as hard to get out of the house
as the white ant.
The reception was preceded by a din-
ner at which Scout and Guide heads
and Red Crossers made merry. The
Bavins were at the reception but not at
the dinner, and this Letter saw no sign of
the Langs at all. The ballroom and the
drawing-room were blazing with light and
roses, and guests blazed with decorations.
Sir Philip and Lady Game, with Lord and
Lady Baden-Powell, stood amiably smiling
and shaking hands with a long, long trail
of multi-colored women, Scout officers com-
plete with khaki shorts, men in white ties
and long tails, and uniformed Girl Guides
in cocked hats, fringed gloves and black
stockings.
The Chief Scout and the Governor
were both Scoutish, but Lady Game and
Lady 8.-P. (thank Heaven!) stuck to
graceful fripperies. Her Ex. showed a line
in parchment chiffons on which velvet flowers
in fiastel tones floated. The Chief Guide’s
rose-pink georgettes cleared the ground, were
garnished with silver flowers, and flew a
shoulder cape. It was quite a relief in the
procession _of black frocks. Mrs. James
Brennap, in jade green supported by dia-
mente shoulder-straps, was another comfort-
ing bit of color. Pale lilac chiffons flowed
about Mrs. James Macarthur Onslow, and
there seemed enough gold in the dress of
Henry Braddon’s lady to back Treasurer
Theodore’s fiduciary notes. Ailsa Cullen, in
her pink laces, suggested a Venetian glass
figurine, and a Ramsay girl wore her black
ban- blown back like the pictures of Michael
the Archangel. Betliia Anderson topped a
trained frock of beige lace with a coat
heavily collared in fur, and stuck to the same
i , ie bot ni ght through. Her mother's
Avalon-blue frock, too, was long and trained.
Jean Cheriton’s shoulders emerged trium-
phant from a black frock patterned with
foliage; Mrs. Geoffrey Hughes’s sapphire-
blue velvets had a cape like a mediaeval .
Italian page’s, and on it was embroidered
a leaf design in silver. The friendly Kelso
Kings were, of course, at both the dinner
and the reception afterwards, as was Mel-
bourne s Lud Mayor Luxton, who is head
of the Australian Boy Scouts’ Association.
A prophetic Sundry Showman long ago
spoke of the Chief Scout as Barnum-Powell.
And to-day no one doubts that his is the
Greatest Show on Earth. The march through
~r e C «7il as £ Friday of the Boy Scouts and
the V olf Cubs, 8000 strong, was one of
tiie most stirring sights Sydney has ever
seen. With banners flying, and kettledrums
urging, the little ones in their blues and
greens stepped out as bravely as their big
kliaki-clad, _ slouch-hatted brothers. There
were seemingly miles of procession. It
swept out of the Domain, down Bridge-
street. George-street stirred to the tramp of
its leet and the music of its bands, among
them the Westmead Boys’ and Forest Lodge
Boys bands. Finally the cohorts of peace
marched, eyes and feet flashing, into Mac-
quaiie-street, and past the platform outside
Burdekin House, where Lord Baden-Powell
—every inch a Scout and probably just as
stnied as the youngest Cub—took the salute,
in that procession, too, marched some sight-
less little boys, and at least one lad was
on a crutch.
trig waist of Lady Baden-Powell
S ? massed background of red roses
an,d dahlias was the fact that smote the eye
ot the advancing guest last week at the
Mayoress s reception to the Chief Guide.
. one girl m the waiting queue mut-
tered her tailor’s got an easy job!” And
indeed the erect figure in the hard-to-wear
Girl Guide costume hadn’t even a sugges-
uon of spare tyre” above the waist. The
ady looks like the English county woman
n a Kipling story. She laughs with her
Ups, her eyes, her hands. She is as jolly as
a , sandb °y’ and as competent as the Rock
of Gibraltar. And if all that’s the result
of a lifetime of Guiding, there’s nothing
Wrong with the game.
Everybody came to the party. There were
a distinguished guest and a popular hostess,
and, apart from these attractions, the social
calendar of Sydney’s “Who’s Who” has lately
been a barren wilderness. There were plump
leather chairs in the corridor outside the
reception-rooms, and cane discomforts (they
felt like our old concert tribulations) on the
flagged balcony. And, of course, there were a
radio broadcast and the omnipresent photo-
grapher. Mrs. Jackson welcomed the Chief
Guide, who in turn welcomed every woman
as a potential member of the great sisterhood
whose age-limit is from eight to eighty-one.
It seems a curious coincidence that Agnes
Murphy (of the fine grey eyes), who was
for years associated with Melba as her
secretary and biographer, should have died
within a week or two of the singer’s death.
Agnes Murpliy was. in her own way, as
Remarkable a woman as Melba. She started
writing in Melbourne in the late ’nineties, and
was for years! on the staff of “Punch.” She
wrote a novel, “One Woman’s Wisdom,” which
in its day was widely read. But publicity
was her great gift, and instinctively she was
drawn to the circles where her talent could
find expression. She probably knew more
about theatrical London, New York, Paris
and Berlin than any other Australian; and
for years she was The Bulletin’s London
correspondent. Two notable successes for
which her clever work was a good deal to
be thanked were the Quinlan Opera Com-
pany and the Sistine Choir tours. _ Her
friends ranged from Royalties to lift-drivers,
from operatic stars to the just-beginning
chorus girl. Her great friend and almost
lifelong companion was Aimee Moore, also
at one time a Melbourne presswoman.
Mrs. Ewan Frazer, widow of the former
A.J.C. committeeman who died on the other
side of tlfe world last year, arrives in Sydney
by the Orford. She was Jessie Middleton,
of Goulburn, one of Sydney’s cleverest
talkers and most beautiful girls when she
married at the beginning of the century. Her
return represents the fulfilment of an old
dream. Though her family became completely
Anglicised years ago she yearned for Aus-
tralia, and she has always kept in touch
with her old Sydney friends. The beautiful
Point Piper flat of the John Martins is hous-
ing her for the present.
H. F. Broadbent, the Sydney airman who
is at Hanworth preparing for his flight to
Australia, is a grandson of Harry Rickards,
of Tivoli fame.
This is A.M.P. medico Craufuird Dickey’s
pretty young daughter Myrna, who will take
the part of Irene in Aimee and Philip
Stuart’s “The Cat’s Cradle,” to be^produced
at Sydney
Savoy Theatre
to - morrow
evening by
the Players’
Club. Myrna
is London-
born, but
came to Aus-
tralia as a
small girl and
spent her
schooldays be-
tween those
well - known
schools Red-
lands and
Lindfield Col-
lege. She
joined the
Players’ Club
(founded, by
the way, by
Francis Jack-
son, the well-
known Bulletin contributor, in 1924) three
years ago. Her first part was that of Fay
in “The Offence,” and she has played Hester
in “The Ship,” Lucy in “A Pair of Spec-
tacles” and Edith in “The Private Secre-
tary.” “Cat’s Cradle” was first produced
five years ago at the London Criterion, when
Marie Tempest scored a triumph in the part
of Angela Fane, the actress, Irene’s mother
in the play.
The thrill of the Girl Guides’ reception to
Lady Baden-Powell came when that vital
lady pinned the Guides’ Order of Merit on
the deserving lapel of Edgeworth David’s
lady, who as State Commissioner has been
a consistent and active worker for the sister-
hood. The decoration was a complete sur-
prise, and the receiver was visibly overcome
both at the honor and the applause from
the front of the house which shattered the
patrician repose of the Blaxland Galleries,
innumerable _ red tables surrounded by
healthy girls in neat blue uniforms, crimson
zinnias and feathery Easter daisies, cur-
rents of enthusiasm, her State Excellency,
the Mayoress, Olive Kelso King, Miss Kate
Egan, Eagle Owl Milliccnt Aspinall, and
the Chief Guide’s A.D.C., Mrs. Brennan,
were high lights in an afternoon electric
with Lady 8.-P.’s high-voltage address on
Guiding.
Two of the most stirring events of the
Scout and Guide rally at Randwick race-
course on Saturday were the display of
signalling by a company of deaf and dumb
boys and the grouping of the banners in
a sort of open square about the Chief Scout.
As the banners dipped and the blues and
greens and yellows fluttered bravely, the
sunlight leaped from gilded point to gilded
point; a crescendo of color, high above
which a fantastic frieze of heads rose
into the late afternoon above the flat
roofs of the stands. Stands and grounds
were crowded, and over all at this
final demonstration applause like a mighty
surf rose and flung itself against the even-
ing sky. The march-past of those leaf-brown
ranks with their varicolored banners; of
those green-and-blue-bound Cubs preceded
by wattle-gold standards; those Girl Guides,
marching like bluejackets (yes, this Letter
swears they march better than the boys),
miles of them along the track that usually
resounds to the thunder of galloping hooves,
this was the spectacular moment. The Chief
Scout stood on a dais to take the salute.
He stood a figure in brown, in his hand a
staff, gazing out like some kindly shepherd
on the thing he had created; and indeed as
the brown hosts passed on into the blurring
distance they were not unlike a slowly-
moving flock of sheep.

•Saturday brought Clara Butt to our midst
once more — as regal a Clara as ever,
and as popular. From chandelier to
the back of the organ gallery the Town
Hall was packed with eager listeners to the
lady’s majestic notes. Clara was marvel-
lously arrayed, swathed in silver to the
heels, probably like Tutankhamen’s wife on
a high holiday. From somewhere near the
lowest stratum of the dress, a silver cobra
of train curled and wound itself in graceful
coils about the singer’s feet. About her long
and truly graceful neck hung ropes and
ropes of diamonds. Earrings like lustres
swung to her collar-bone, and her head was
coroneted in silver sown thick with jewels.
From her right arm flowed a rhythm of
azure-blue scarves. The audience gave her
a reception that can only be called an ova-

From Queensland:—
Lady Goodwin opened the doll and flower show in
the City Hall; it was for the Presbyterian Children’s
Homes. Dolls of all nations and periods were
there. Eighteenth-century dolls danced on a village
green round a historic maypole, and a modern set
played tennis. Dolls in bridal gowns posed before a
tiny camera; dolls in beach chairs and beach pyjamas
decorated a sand enclosure. There was a hospital
of doll patients; there were dolls at the telephone
and the wash-tub; Scotch dolls and Magyar dolls.
The Governor’s lady wore two-toned beige mariette
and an amber hat swathed with brown velvet.
The Governor and the Premier were at the St.
Patrick’s Day dinner in the Queensland Irish Associ-
tion’s rooms. Attorney-General Macgroarty is
president; Sir John mentioned that he learned to
shoot and ride in Ireland; and the Rev. Father T.
O’Connor proposed “The Day We Celebrate.”
Donald C. Mackay was married in St. John’s
Cathedral to Nita C. Ussher. The bride, who was
given away by Charles Elliott, was in ivory satin
with an old rose-point lace train and a Brussels-net
veil, worn with a narrow train of orange buds. Barbara
Allom ’maided in leaf-green moire with a wreath
of green velvet leaves on her hair. Atcherley saw
the feasting. Bottle-green was the travelling frock
and the ’moon rises in the South.
Lady Goodwin w'as at the garden party held at
Mrs. Farmer’s home, Redlands, Toowoomba, and
arranged by the delegates of the C.W.A. conference
in honor of Mrs. J. H. Fairfax. The City band
played and Clare O’Bryen, Helen Hogden, Phyllis
Allen and Cynthia Marson danced eurhythmies under
the shady trees, with the uncommon background of
rosemary hedges. The guest was presented with a
de luxe book containing pictures of those present at
the eight annual meetings in Toowoomba. Lady
Goodwin wore mushroom floral georgette; Mrs. Fair,
fax was in beige and black and Mrs. Farmer in black
and white; while Mrs. A. E. Moore, who always
has pretty gowns, chose green and blue floral.
At Christ Church, Childers, Frank Calmyre
married Ivy Phyllis Brand. The bride was in ivory
triple ninon, with broidered Brussels-net veil.
Doris Gorrie and Doris Brand ’maided in salmon
pink.
The new building of the Brisbane Boys’ College
at Toowong was opened by the Governor and a
memorial to Robert Philp unveiled. Two and a
half acres of land were presented to the school
by the Philp family. Lady Goodwin accompanied
the Governor; the Chief Justice and Archbishops
Sharp and Duhig were on the platform.
When the Tanda berthed at New Farm, Clara
Butt and Kennerley Rumford were met by a number
of musical people including George Matheson, Mrs.
Fred Tritton, Miss Flower, Leonard Francis, J.
L. Gasteen, J. W. Siemon and E. D. Board.
Sir John and Lady Goodwin went to Clara Butt’s
opening concert in the City Hall. The dame wore
cloth of silver moulded to the figure, and then
flaring out with a fish-train and scarf drape in
turquoise-blue with silver fringe. Her swathed turban
head-dress was caught with a huge turquoise;
in addition she wore a necklet bracelet and
earrings of emeralds. Cicely Murray, the pianist,
(she is the singer’s niece), was in salmon-pink. Mrs.
N. A. H. Campbell was with Lady Goodwin, and Mr.
and Mrs. J. E. Trude, Everil Trude, Patricia Bell and
Ann Blundell were with the Governor’s party. The
Chief Justice, the Mayor, their spouses, the
Harold Kyngs, the Fred Trittons and Mr. and Mrs.
B. F. C. Forde were amongst the very large audience.
In the afternoon the singer was fSted at the
Women’s Club.
And from Tassie :
The Lieut.-Gov. opened the Tasmanian Art Society’s
annual exhibition at F.O.M.’s new gallery. There
are about 160 exhibits. Outstanding work is shown
by John Eldershaw, Joseph Connor, E. E. Unwin,
Blanche Murphy, Betty Hood, M. Dechaineux, M.
Hookey and Mildred Lovett. A sketch by the late G.
W. Lambert of Col. Cox Taylor, drawn when artist
and subject were both in hospital, attracted a lot
of interest.
Matron Gluyas has retired from the Hobart General
Hospital after many years of efficient service. Sister
Helena Lade, who was sub-matron, takes her place.
Ottilie, daughter of the Herbert Riggalls, Horton,
Ross, became Mrs. Henry Tasker at St. David’s
Cathedral, in a soft oyster-white supple satin frock
made with a three-tiered skirt and worn with
a Limerick-lace veil caught with orange blossoms.
The ’maids were sister Nessie, Mary Viney and Con-
stance Campbell, dressed respectively in blue, pink
and lemon lace frocks with detachable coatees and
little caps of tulle-edged lace. Little Cynthia Tasker,
in Kate Greenaway costume, acted as trainbearer.
About 70 guests made merry at the Imperial after-
wards.
The military camp at Mona Yale, Ross, anticipated
Easter with this year’s activities. The Eustace
Camerons had a houseful of guests, as had several
others in the district. The church parade and the
gymkhana on the Sunday, were .well attended, many
folk coming from Hobart for a few lively days.
Sir Harry Haward (Eng.) and his two daughters,
who are doing a world tour, fetched up at Hobart
as the guests of Sir Harry’s brother-in-law, Lt.-Col.
L. E. Thomas. Mrs. Thomas had a number of
friends to tea at Hadley’s to meet her guests, and
received in a printed dhiffon in beige and blue, with
black hat. One of the Haward girls is a B.Sc.
of London University.
Captain Holbrook and his officers gave a lively
little informal dance on board the Canberra. Mrs.
Holbrook, in black mousseline-de-soie and net, was
official hostess. Rear-Admiral and Mrs. Evans were
there, and the lasses of the village had their lads
as well as many naval partners. A few late
swallows among mainland and English visitors were
others among the guests.

Melbourne
Chatter
A jolly little hop at the Rex last week
brought monetary aid to the Renown Free
Kindergarten. Mrs. Leslie Benjamin and
Esme Frankenburg were ticket. secretaries,
arid the director of the kindergarten, Dorothy
Carlisle, who was a member of the organis-
ing committee, danced in yellow silk. Pat
Peterson, another helper, had touches of
blue on her white tulle frock; and Betty
Erswell \yore a necklace of. black beads with
her white gown. Others there were Judge
and Mrs. G. Dethridge, she in softly-flounced
apparel of black; Mrs. 11. S. K. Ward;
Major E. Henty and Moira Bryans, the last-
named in golden-brown chiffon.
The younger members of the Society of
St. George went gay one evening last week
and jazzed in the dance-room of 3LO, deco-
rated for the occasion with a huge Union
Jack, the banner of ' the society’s patron
saint and other patriotic emblems. Mrs.
F. G. Limebeer, wife of the president, danced
in lace, and Mrs. J. W. C. Downes sported
black georgette _ with embellishment of silver
beads. Marjorie Limebeer chose lime-green
floral-patterned taffetas; Ethel was in
gros-grain of turquoise hue. Mrs. G. E. New-
ton’s frock of pale water-green silk was
overlaid with black-spotted net, and Jessie
Downs achieved a spring effect in leaf-
green satin.
Melbourne last week was full of engineers
from all States, assembled for the annual
conference of their institution. Chief of the
social entertainments for the delegates and
their better-halves was a dance, with bridge,
at the • Windsor. Among those who attended
were the former' president, Colonel J. M.
Corlette (Newcastle), and Mrs. Corlette; the
new president, J. R. Kemp, of Brisbane, and
Mrs. Kemp, who was in pale-green satin;
Mr. and Mrs. H. A. Creswell, of Perth ; the
A. J. Gibsons, of Sydney, and Mrs. H. R.
Harper, convenor of the women’s committee.
The tea-party at which the proceeds of
the performances of “Sunnyside,” staged at
the Bijou for the Somers camp, were tallied
Avas a smart affair. It was held at Mrs.
Emmcrton’s home at South Yarra, and Lord
Somers went along to return thanks.
As Mrs. Emmerton and her committee
covered the expenses, all takings from tickets,
sAveets, flowers and programmes constituted
clear profit, and over £650 was gathered in.
Dr., C. G. McAdam, who has supervised all
arrangements for the boys who have enjoyed
the pleasures of a vacation at this holiday
camp, added his thanks.
An American tea was held at the nerv
Town Hall at Caulfield, proceeds going to
buy jam for the Alfred Hospital. Each
patron brought a gift and bought an article.
The Caulfield auxiliary, with Mrs. W. H.
Weeks at the head, organised the affair.
Mayoress Ritchie launched the party.
The Royal Horticultural Society held its
autumn show last week in a Bourke-street
emporium, the two-days’ display being mainly
made up of dahlias and gladioli. The dahlias,
of which there were several new varieties,
were remarkable for their great size. Out-
standing were Thomas Hay, a huge deep
petunia double; the Bishop of Llandoff, a
deep red single of medium size, and Mepliis-
toplielcs, whose petals suggested curling
flames. A specimen of the original “cocina”
dahlia, the ancestor of the race as it were,
discovered by the Swedish botanist Dahl,
excited interest. The most perfect gladioi
came from the Beritleigh district; some of
these ran the gamut from the palest mauve
to the deepest purple. A few nice roses
and .some well-grown delphiniums were other
features of the well-staged show.
The event of last week in arty circles was
the opening of Arthur Streeton’s show, in
which pictures of roses in crystal vases are
mingled with glimpses of' misty blue hills
and green valleys. The artist commands good
prices even in these hard times, three can-
vases marked with a red seal aggregating
£550 in value. At the Athenseum Annie
Gates and Miss M. Holgdte show landscapes
and flower pieces, the latter including studies
of the red and cream flowering-gum and
other wild blossoms. Some examples of
China painting—coffee- and tea-cups—are
also shown. Ola Cohn’s work is on view
in her own green-floored studio. On the
opening day the sculptor Avore the red-bor-
dered goAvn, white hood 1 and quaint mil-
linery of an Associate of the Royal College
of Artists, and crowds flocked to inspect the
array of figures in bronze, marble, stone,
wood and ivory. A. T. Woodward, of Ben-
digo, who gave the artist her first lessons
in modelling, launched ’ the show.
The F. W. Egglestons entertained- at
"supper Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Brookes and
■ RandallDavies,' buyer of pictures for the
Felton. Bequest. The hostess, in black ninon
with a glimmer of rhinestones, was aided'
by her daughter Jean, whose brocade dra-
peries mingled green and silver. Among the
guests were Uni. Chancellor MacFarland,
Harrison Moore and liis lady and Prof, and
'Mrs. Ernest Scott. , .
• The long-established Time and Talents
Society reviewed its work of last year at a
social gathering held ■in the hall of the
Toorak kirk. The president, Mrs. Rutter
Clarke, and vice-presidents, the; Elder lady
and Mrs, J. C. Syme, were hostesses. It was
recorded that members had stitched for the
Melbourne and Children’s Hospitals, and that
the Braille-writers’ section had prepared
various books added to the Library for the
Blind. Miss E. Henty is hon. sec. of the
society, which includes an energetic junior
section.
The programme of the British Music
Society’s first concert of the year, held at
Grong Grong, the residence of the T. Smiths,
included part-singing of madrigals and folk-
songs of the sixteenth century, many of the
latter having been set for mixed voices by
Mrs. Harold Browning, who conducted the
choir. Roy Warren contributed pianoforte
solos. Mrs. Smith entertained performers and
audience, numbering together over a hundred,
at supper. President Thomas Brentnall wel-
. corned back to Melbourne W. McKie, who
takes over the duties of city organist, and
pianist Roy Shepherd, who has been study-
ing abroaef. Mrs. Norman Gadsden,
daughter of the T. Smiths of Grong Grong,
who went to England to continue her vocal
training about 18 months ago, is now in
Paris, studying opera with Madame Gillj.
Mrs. Gadsden, who was a mezzo-soprano, has
developed into a dramatic soprano, and is
preparing for a debut in opera. In Mel-
bourne she was a student of Mrs. Harold
Browning.
At St. Patrick’s Cathedral, Father
McHugh, of Kilmore, forged the links between
Kathleen, elder daughter of the Alfred Shaw
Fitchetts, of Wilandra, Terang, and Ken-
neth, elder son_of the Charles Le M. Allans,
of Hampton. Lace of beige tint was worn by
the hride, topped by a matching velvet toque.
Her sister Alison attended in pink georgette
with a rose-decked hat.
The Old Students’ Association of the Uni.
Con. staged a welcome for City Organist
McKie. Winifred L. Mitchell, hon. sec., wear-
ing sparkling black georgette, extended a fra-
ternal hand, backed up by president Sutton
Crow and vice-presidents J. A. Steele and
Winifred Francis. Mrs. Maurice Kauffman
spoke on the development of Jewish music,
Julia Russell providing vocal illustrations.
The Old Wesley Collegians’ Dram. Soc.
staged “Bulldog Drummond” at the Bijou,
proceeds going to the upkeep of the school’s
sports ground. The well-filled house yielded
a generous tribute of flowers. Irene
Mitchell and Miss Krome were the feminine
stars, and Godfrey Cass directed.
This is a Broothorn portrait of Mrs.
Harry Creswick, whose husband is a son
of A. T. Cres-
w i c k, well
known in rac-
ing and hunt-
in g circles.
The other day
Mrs. Cres-
wick staged a
fete at her
home, Yar-
rien, Toorak,
in aid of the
Lady North-
cote Free Kin-
dergarten, of
which she is
president, and
profits amount-
ed to about
£350. The
State Gover-
nor’s daugh-
ter, the Hon.
Elizabeth
Somers Cocks,
was one of the attendants at the children’s
stall.
The Gregan McMahon Players started their
1931 season with a production of Eden and
Adelaide Phillpotts’s “Yellow Sands” at the
Comedy. The piece was given a picturesque
seaside setting, and in the second act a
cottage interior with Early Victorian fur-
nishings contained some real antiques. A
very high pianoforte with a front of green
satin, gathered into a small central mirror,
a vividly green crab and a stuffed fox-terrier
in a glass case, a framed sampler and pic-
tures worked in wool were on view. Beat-
trice Day, as Jenifer Varwell, looked parti-
cularly charming in grey and blue patterned
silk made in bustle mode.
The picturesque road that trails from the
city by way of Ferntree Gully winds over
the hills to Emerald, about 40 miles out.
Here is a little residential colony established
by the Emerald Country Club. About 350
acres have been divided into building sites,
golf links and tennis courts, and there is
also.a swimming pool. Members of the club
are.-each expected to purchase a block of
land, and half a dozen comfortable homes
with nice gardens dot one of the slopes.
These residences are surrounded by a beau-.
: tiful park, in which plantations of pine and
wattle mingle their varied greens with maples
and other handsome trees. The clubhouse
is a cosy; dwelling with accommodation for
1G guests, and at week-ends it'is w r ell patron-
ised.
Members of the South Yarra Auxiliary of
the Children’s Hospital met in the
ballroom of Raveloe, home of the senior pre-
sident, Mrs. Harry Emmerton. The Chauvcl
lady, as president, had the chair. It was
reported that the income of the institution
had declined by £OOO a week in recent times,
and a series of bridge parties was decided on as
a means of getting in some money. Audrey
Poolman has taken on the duties of hon. sec.
The Country Women’s Association will
hold its annual conference next month. Lady
Somers should be back from England by that
time, and is expected to be present. Mrs.
Harry Creswick, senior country vice-presi-
dent, will give an evening reception at her
home at Toorak to welcome the delegates,
and there will be a theatre party.
A city firm •is selling chinaware manu-
factured in England to commemorate the
birth of the second daughter of the Yorks,
who was baptised Margaret Rose. Tea-
things, porringers and plates bear a design
of a small posy—a couple of marguerite
daisies and a pink rose mingled with a sprig
or two of pink heather. The china is white
with a very tiny edging of blue.

The Yarra bank is just now a popular
rendezvous on Sunday mornings, for rowing
practice has begun. Motor-cars are lined
up along Alexandra-drive, and beneath the
palms on Henley lawns there is a crowd of
onlookers. The scene is charming, for
autumn has not yet robbed the trees of their
foliage.
Melbourne has a woman house-decorator,
Jean Kerr McDonald. When the Chatterer ran
across her she was clad in tweed plus-fours
with a white linen coat, putting the finishing
touches to a parchment frieze in the private
dining-room at the Lyceum Club. Miss
McDonald doesn’t merely dress-up a dwelling
with draperies and furniture; she does
the hard work of painting, tinting or paper-
ing the walls. She specialises in stencilled
designs on parchment, used to beautify panels,
doors and other spaces, a mode of decora-
tion much in favor just now in the U.S.A.
She was educated at Merton Hall
(C.E.G.G.S.), where she qualified for a
diploma in kindergarten work. Leaving school
she went to England and went through a
course at a secretarial college in Piccadilly.
Thus equipped she secured an engagement as
one of the secretaries at the 1923 Assembly
of the League of Nations. Visiting America
a couple of years ago, she was seized with
the idea of making a profession of interior
decoration, and studied color harmony and
design at South California Uni. (Los
Angeles), later taking a course in practical
wall treatment at the Frank Wiggins Trade
School. This much-travelled lady has also
been in South Africa, Brazil, China and
Japan.
Greetings from Westralia
His Ex. is oil this week to see how prospectors
live and work at Larkinville. On Sunday he will
officially open St. Hilda’s 0. of E. School for Girls.
Gumtips and dahlias camouflaged the platform
and roses and Michaelmas daisies bloomed upon the
supper-tables in the Karrakatta Club Hall when the
L. A. B. Club gave itself an at-home. Hands -of
welcome were lifted by president Mrs. Cecil Mason,
wearing tangerine velvets with platinum-lace inserted
into the cape, and hon. secretary Gladys Orchard,
in primrose chiffionsi There werle addresses, a
musical programme, “Me and My Diary,” a playlet
produced by Anita Fitz Gerald, and the presentation
of a bag and a piece of antique jewellery to Miss
Orchard, who leaves soon for overseas.
Captain and Mrs. Mervyn Hobbs have arrived on
furlough from India and are at present the guests
of the Hobbs lady at Peppermint Grove.
Norah Parker has recently returned from India
and is staying with her sister, Mrs. Keenan.
The first Westralian-born woman to take her law
degree in this State is Enid Russell, who applied
for admission to the Bar this week. The voung
legal light is the daughter of the late C. T. Russell,
sometime partner in the firm of which the late
R. T. Robinson was head.
Ardent dancers have had little opportunity tor
twinkling their toes during the last few months,
and the Gladys Moncrieff cabaret run by the Hole-
proof and Staley Hosiery Co. for the Childien s
Hospital was a good excuse for a frolic. Gladys
appeared in leaf-green georgettes with flares sweep-
ing to the floor and ecru-lace ornamenting her coatee.
She lifted up her voice in Teresa’s “Love Will Find
a Way” from “Maid of the Mountains,” and “My
Hero” from “The Chocolate Soldier.” The Kerr-
Pearse family accompanied his Ex. Mrs. R. 0.
Law wore black moire; Mrs. Gordon Craig’s choice
was sherry-red ninon; Mrs. Leslie danced in black
georgettes; flowered chiffons swayed about Marjoiie
Hearman’s ankles; Mrs. Tom Flintoff pinned a pink
flower upon the corsage of her black gown ; Dot
Kirby wore chartreuse-greens; Elizabeth Edwards
favored black hail-spotted net; and Grace Thiel was
in dawn-pink laces and chiffons.
Dr. and Mrs. Donald Tregonning gave a , bridge
party at their home in Mount-street in honor of
the engagement of Stella Meagher and Louis Beasley.
Another recent sliivoo brought about by a betrothal
was a surprise party which invaded Mrs. R. T.
Robinson’s home in Mount Lawley to say nice things
to her daughter Mollie and fiance Emile Oliver.
Mrs. Joseph Hislop, a Swedish woman of excep-
tional charm, and Mrs. E. J. Carroll, who is dark
as her friend is fair, stepped off the Orford for the
few hours that the vessel was in port en route from
England to the Eastern States. Kittie Gillies, spon-
sored by Musgrove’s, Ltd., met the couple, who both
wore black and white glace and crepe de Chine en-
sembles, and Mrs. Hislop’s 15-year-old May, a lass
with a delightful accent. Morning tea at the
Karrakatta Club was followed by a drive and
luncheon at the Esplanade, where Fullers’ repre-
sentative Elsie Pittard was of the party.
And from Adelaide :
The winter already shows promise of festivity.
Mesdames W. G. T. Goodman and Bronte Smeaton
are giving a dance in the Australia Hall on April
17, and the parents of Pat Goode have issued invi-
tations for a shivoo on April 10 at the. Koojyonga
Golf Clubhouse.
The Toe H bridge party at the Palais Royal on
Thursday night proved a financial success; the 200
tables mean a nice addition to the society’s funds.
Proprietor Carmichael gave the Palais free, and also
donated the prize for the ladies. A Toe H man
gave the men’s prize. The Women Helpers’ League
fed the multitude, and a bevy of pretty girls sold
sweets. Bridge players are rather unfairly taxed
in these days by the most popular method of raising
funds for charity.
The Mayoress (Mrs. C. R. J. Glover) arranged a
reception in her room at the Town Hall to meet
Dorothy Gill, Gregory Stroud and Ivan Menzies, of
the Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Co. We shall miss
the light and airy Charles Walenn, who fitted like
a glove into so many of the parts.
Miss Jessie McMaster, after spending several weeks
in Adelaide as the guest of Mrs. T. E. Barr-Smith,
has returned to Sydney.
The meeting of the Port Adelaide R.C. at Chelten-
ham was held in lovely weather. The chairman,
Dr. A. V. Benson, and his wife entertained at after-
noon tea. Mrs. Benson looked well in a bright navy
pin-spot crepe de Chine frock and wide-brimmed
straw hat to match. She has just returned- with
her sisters from a motor tour to Mount Gambier,
where their childhood was spent. An outstanding
smart frock at the meeting was a white marocain
with Egyptian printed design, worn by Mrs. Fred
Tennant with a natural straw wide-brimmed hat.
An exhibition of pictures as a means of raising
funds for charity, is a good proposition when the
artist is Hans Heysen. The Heysen paintings drew
an attendance of over 2000 people, which will mean
a nice little cheque for the Queen’s Home.
Mrs. Gerald Hack has returned to Medindie from
Melbourne, where she has been on a visit to her
parents, Mr. and Mrs. G. Langridge.
Miss Dorothy Slane, daughter of Colonel and Mrs.
J* C. F. Slane, of Unley, after several years in
America as a professional dancer, has arrived in
Adelaide on a visit to her parents.

SHADOW SHOWS.
Sydney lias just had five more or less
•British talkies running simultaneously at
its principal theatres. “Balaclava” at the
Lyceum, unlike “Charley’s Aunt,” is 100
per cent. English. Apart from its all-British
cast it was shot on Salisbury Plain. TJirfor-
tunately, it can’t be hailed as a success. The
illusionists of Hollywood have set standards
of realism, particularly as regards equestrian
pictures, that take a lot of living up to, and
this Dominions picture falls far below them.
In the immortal charge, made in mass forma-
tion with the Russian guns blazing away
at point-blank range, not a horse falls,
►similarly with the charge of the Russian
cavalry against the “thin red line.” On the
first night oafish guffaws were loud and
frequent, and some of them were directed at
episodes in which care had been taken to
preserve historical accuracy. The maehiiie-
like methods of the British riflemen and flu;
elaborate make-up of Lord Raglan, for
example.
The plot is dull—the old one about the
disgraced officer who enlists and clears his
name, Cyril McLaglen plays Lieut. Ken-
nedy,. who is cashiered for duelling and sus-
pected of having murdered his adversary. As
a trooper he falls in love with Benita Hume,
who is a Scottish lass running a farm in
t .. e . Crimea. Evidently realising the impossi-
bility of making the combination credible
Miss I-lume presents the maiden as a toothy
modern flapper. The best feature of the
picture is its reconstruction of life in a
British regiment 75 years ago, and the worst
the recitation of “The Charge of the Light
Jbngaide” by an unseen vox huniawa while
the brigade is galloping at the futile guns.
* * *
The Capitol offered an all-British crook
play and a British-American farce on the
same bill; not to mention some excellent
vaudeville turns. A wonderful entertainment
tor the money.
“Night Birds” is as exciting as any of
the American thrillers, equally well photo-
graphed and sound-produced, and no more
unreal. The formula is Wallace-like in its
simplicity. Given Detective Cross, of Scot-
land Yard, find the identity of “Plash Jack,”
who is in the habit of killing people by
throwing knives at them. The hunt begins at
a dinner-party. The host is making a speech
when there is a howl—found subsequently
to have emanated from a knifed footman—
and robbers appear and remove the guests’
jewellery. It is the “Flash Jack” touch.
Instinct takes Mr. Cross to Chariot’s Club,
where there is another tragedy, Then he
visits a vaudeville show, ties up the star’s
dancing-partner, pinches his costume, takes
Ins place on the stage (unbeknownst to
the star, who is in with Jack), swings into
a box at the. end of a rope while the occu-
pants are being robbed, pursues one of the
robbers up to the roof, and there fights him.
The energy of the man is only surpassed by
his skill in dodging knives. After about
lj hours of pursuit and evasion Jack turns
out to be one of the last characters you’d
have suspected, and the slight rift that had
appeared in the domestic relations of Mr.
and Mrs. Cross is explained away.
Jack Raine (Cross) is a typical London
bobby—one of those dapper little men with
Etonian voices who are equally at home con-
trolling Piccadilly 'traffic or lounging in
1 iccadilly clubs. Eve Gray’s Mrs. Cross is
no less lifelike. Fragile beauty, a Mayfair
manner, Paquin frocks —she has all the
attributes recommended by the handbook sup-
t° recruits to the Force in the chapter
01 \< Choosing a Policeman’s Wife.”
‘Along Came Youth,” the supporting fea-
ture, has an English setting but most of
the principals are Yanks. You wonder why
the laughter is. so uproarious, and then
realise that the dialogue is smart and that the
actor-producer is George Marion. There are
few who can touch him at this class of job.
Fox-Movietone’s “Are You There?” which
was on at the Regent at the same time, is
more pretentious and duller. Described as
A Musical Farce,” one of its few merits is
that it contains hardly any music. Beatrice
Lillie, who has a detective agency, is con-
sulted by a duke’s son about his parent’s
affair with Olga Baclanova, adventuress. Ail
hands leave London, wtiere the agency is, for
Scotland and the castle of the duke (George
Grossmith). The S.P.S.H.R. (Society for
the Prevention of Scotland being Held up
to Ridicule) ought to do something about
Eos picture. There is a hunting scene in
which an ostler is provided with a sort of
spotted Great Dane which he uses as a
harrier. Some more normal hounds climb I
trees and the fox takes refuge in Miss Lillie's
7 a .P\ Episodes of the sort continue till Miss !
Lillie turns inconsequently to Mr. Grossmith,
whom she has addressed throughout with
indifference as “Duky,” and it appears they
are in love. /He produces a coronet, and
dumps it on her head with the remark “Your
Grace,” and all is over. In addition to the
artists named, the gifts of Gustav von
beyftertitz are squandered on this drivel.
' Efie censor who cut that great picture
“Liliom” to pieces seems to accord special
tolerance to works like “Are You There?”
One of its features is a nightdress episode
m which Miss Baclanova is soundly wal-
loped by Beatrice Lillie on and around those
regions which are favored by schoolmasters
as being insusceptible to- organic or func-
tional damage.
* # *
Warm Corner,” which was pre-shown
at Melbourne Majestic, is also British. It
is mainly a satire on the profiteer in society.
The performance of Leslie Henson and
Connie Ediss—especially of the lady—pre-
vents the show falling into commonplace-
ness. Connie Ediss, who was here with
Dorothy Brunton in “Canary Cottage” some
years ago, is five times as impressive on the
screen as on the stage. Her study of the
vulgarian trying to live up to her husband’s
newly-acquired millions is pathetic rather
than funny. It lias the rare quality of touch-
ing the springs of human emotions. Henson,
on the other hand, is more the clown, rely-
ing on an amazingly plastic visage and con-
ventionally-farcical situations. The rest of
the cast are of no outstanding merit, or the
producer and sound-reproducer don’t do
them justice.

One Fine Night.
HORTON BROOKS TELLS A VIVID WAR STORY THAT IS DIFFERENT
FROM ALL THE OTHERS.
STILL no sign of the cook’s cart. What
could be keeping Brownie? I thought
he would have been back by now.
Just my luck to strike guard to-night!
The very night of the concert in the Y.M.C.A.
hut. I would have given more than a few
francs to see the Tommy troupe that all the
talk was about. To think a man was wast-
ing his time here on a night like this, keep-
ing guard over these cursed ammunition-
waggons ! Did they think someone would
“pinch” them? That was the worst of being
down at the waggon-line; nothing but guards
and fatigues! Still, a man couldn’t always
be up with the guns; he had to take a turn
at the waggon-line now and again.
Wonder how Curly and Louise were enjoy-
ing themselves at the concert? I’d bet
neither of them was giving a thought to
Brownie at the moment. And they wouldn’t
be there if it hadn’t been for Brownie. The
way of the world, wasn’t it?
Would / have done that? No; I’m
damned sure I wouldn’t have! It wasn’t as
if Brownie didn’t know what he was taking
ou, either; he had driven the cook’s cart up
to the forward gun only a few nights ago.
He knew what it meant, all right enough. It
was bad enough taking ammunition up there;
bad enough when you had someone to talk
to, sitting on the limber. But to drivfe the
cook’s cart up there alone —it must be a
nightmare. That stretch you had to go
through just before you reached the copse,
the copse on the left there — that, for
instance. Any time a machine-gun might
open out on you. A machine-gun, mind!
That would show you how close up the for-
ward gun was.
No; / wouldn’t have done it. Still —yes,
if I had thought more of Louise, perhaps I
would. But a man ran enough risks without
looking for trouble.
When I barged into the farmhouse for that
cup of coffee 1 knew I wouldn’t be welcome,
of course. I knew Curly would be there witli
Louise. But I hadn’t expected to see
Brownie there-'—or anyone else, for that
matter. By the look of things, everyone
had already made off for the concert. Such
a quiet chap, Brownie; always writing home.
And there he was—at it again, over his coffee.
But Louise! By Jove, hadn’t she dolled
herself up properly! Never thought that
Curly would be game enough to take her
along to the concert —with all the crowd
there. All dressed up and ready to go with
Curly.
And then the disappointment on Curly’s
face when Sergeant Saunders had come in
and had told him he would have to take the
cook’s cart up to-night!
“Sorry, Curly,” he had said. “Donnelly's
gone sick and has let me down at the last
moment. There’s not another man available.
Barring the guard and stable picket, there's
not a soul about the place.” And then, as
lie had caught sight of Brownie sitting in the
corner there, “I can’t very well detail
Brownie for the job, you know —he struck
it only a few nights ago!”
The look, too, on Louise when she gathered
wliat was in the air! Her little cry of dis-
appointment. And then the way Brownie had
stepped forward.
Of course, it was a temptation for Curly.
And the calm way Brownie went about it
made it easier for him. He made so light
of it.
“Just you trot along with Louise; I’m
doing nothing.”
Nothing theatrical about Brownie. He
wasn’t posing as an example of chivalry.
Louise—she had been just a little too
eager, hadn’t she? Curly had hesitated for
quite a while: I would say that for him. No
man worth his salt liked to see another
fellow running a risk on his account. A
temptation for Curly with Louise standing
alongside him there.. Still, when he had
accepted Brownie’s offer, I had been more
than a little disappointed in him.
And Louise? Yes; it had struck me that
her gratitude could have been a bit more
genuine. The quickness, too, with which
she had taken hold of Curly’s arm !
Curly. I had always thought him rather
on the weak side; nothing much in him. Had
never imagined he could be in earnest over
anything. But how he had fallen for Louise !
Those dreamy eyes of hers —they had some-
thing to do with it. They could infatuate
a man.
“Gawd’s truth! You don’t mean to say
you’re thinkin’ of marryin’ a Froggie?”
A lot of notice Curly had taken of Tich !
Yes, things were looking that way; it did
seem that Curly was in earnest. llow com-
pletely he had cut that Belgian corporal out
of the running! lie never came near the
place now. Poor old Jacques! I couldn’t
help feeling a little sorry for him. A hard
row he had to hoe when we came along! A
bit too effeminate for my liking, Jacques;
but not a bad sort of chap, it had struck
me. A jolly good linguist, too; I would have
learnt something from him. A pity he tossed
in the towel so soon.
I wonder now. Perhaps it is those widow’s
togs of hers that has rather put me against
Louise. That war widow I met in London
last Blighty leave. A war widow! —well, I
thought she was. Perhaps that has got some-
thing to do with it; perhaps that accounts for
my prejudice against Louise. But, in that
respect, at least, she’s the genuine article,
right enough. How do the Froggies put it
again? “Mort pour la patrie”—that’s it. And
so, when his son was killed, the old man
here took the widow under his wing. An
ill-assorted pair, these two, living together
alone in the farmhouse here. She had been
a shopgirl at Lille once. And he? Just
look at those hands of his ; his clay-coated
corduroy breeches, too. Too stolid, perhaps;
but I rather liked the old man. A pity he
was so deaf.
His farmhouse, standing rigiit up against
the road —such a substantial old place; it
had quite taken my fancy. If I could draw,
I would like to make a picture of it. The
lofty pitch of the thatched roof; the little
attic windows, the tread-wheel at the back
door —but I didn’t like that. Cruel, making
a dog turn that wheel; still that was the
way they churned their butter in these parts.
Tobacco-leaves hanging under the eaves, hung
out to dry. A fine old place—and these
people still living here, close-to the line. No
other home, I suppose; and they were con-
tent to take the risk.
Time must be getting on. No, not a sound
of it. That would be a g.s. waggon, not the
cook's cart. Brownie was taking his time.
Nothing gone wrong, I hope.
About time I sloped arms and padded off
along the beat again. Ah! came to the
slope in tip-top style that time! And not a
soul to see me, either! What a waste!
That was a fair thing. Here’s the foot-
board of a limber to lean against; let’s take
it easy for a while.
Off at twelve, and then on again from
four to six. Oh, well, it wouldn’t be so bad.
A glorious night! Not like the last time I
struck guard. Lord, it was miserable, stand-
ing here in the driving rain!
A glorious night! llow bright the stars
were shining! Why, one time I hardly
realised there were such things as stars —
that’s all the notice I took of ’em. But
standing here on guard alone made a man
think of things he should give more thought
to at other times.
Ah! A bit of a strafe started, over to
the left. Those gun-flashes —how they lit
up the sky ! Look at that! Fascinating,
wasn’t it?, Something a man would remem-
ber all his life. Give me something to look
at, too. Hadn’t been much doing to-night
so far. Well, I’m a nice dog, I am—talking
like that and some poor devils getting it in
the neck! See, already—Fritz wasn’t taking
it lying down. There was plenty of stuff
coming back now. Hope they don’t take
it into their heads to send some this way.
A 5.0, or two, say? From back here it
looked mighty terrifying, awesome. It
made you wonder how a man could
ever have the guts to stick that out!—and
that!. —Christ, just look at that! And yet,
when a man was up there right in the thick
of it, it didn’t seem so bad, in a way. 11c
didn’t think about it: that was it. Just
took what was coming to him. But wasn’t
it rotten, going up into it! That’s where
a man felt it so much. He was all eyes then.
Eyes?—why, you could knock them off with
a stick!
Brownie wouldn’t be having too pleasant a
time up there in the cook’s cart. My God,
no! Covering so much ground—that was so
much worse than staying in the one spot.
Never knew when or where you’d strike it.
Hang it all, it was about time Brownie
turned up.
Here, why was I fussing myself so much
about him? I’d bet Curly and Louise would
be too much taken up with themselves and
the concert to be thinking about Brownie.
I>rownie. What a thorough-going chap he
was, Avasn’t he? And yet, somehow, I hadn't
seemed to have realised that before. .lust
look him for granted—that was all. Lord,
what a bonser lot of chaps a man had for
his cobbers, didn’t he now? Out here —
wasn’t it wonderful what fellows would do
for each other! Why, it was the best thing
I had ever seen in life! A man’s love for
a woman? —it was nothing to it. When you
came to analyse it, there Avas ahvays some-
thing selfish about that. Women? Queer
lioav they mucked up the world! A man Avas
a lot better off Avithout them. Yes, I had
found that out on Gallipoli. All those
months, and not a woman in sight. And
what was the effect of that? It seemed—
it seemed to put the Avliole croAvd on a higher
plane, didn’t it?
But what Avas I doing, moralising like
this? And yet standing here on guard all
by himself somehow made a man do that.
Hadn’t I often noticed it? Strange, too,
lioav I had got into the Digger way of think-
ing, wasn't it? Once I used to try to give
a polish to my thoughts. But this sort of
life—it Avas a damned sight too practical for
that.
Hullo? Horses stirring a bit, eh? They
hadn’t given the stable picket much to do so
far. They had had plenty of work lately,
though, taking up all this ammunition to
the guns. That Avould make them quiet,
l’oor beggars! And they wouldn’t even let
them have a rug at night uoav—all the rugs
had been called in. Still, I suppose it was
the proper thing to do; it Avould make
them more hardy.
Listen! Now, that sounds more like it!
That’s a f tco-Avheeled vehicle all right ! And
yes —yes, I AA 7 ould recognise old Dogsbody's
clop-clop-clop anyAA'here.
Thank goodness ! I Avas beginning to get
anxious about Brownie. Lord, wouldn tit
have been a shame if he had got knocked
just on Curly’s account! For a chap like
Curly!
Better move along to the other end of the
beat now, so as to sling a bit of mud at
Brownie as he came in. He Avould be making
straight for the horse-lines, of course; but
the end of the boat Avould bring me near
enough to him.
Getting near uoav. Would be just about
passing the front door of the farmhouse.
Here lie Avas! Didn’t a cook’s cart look
comical! It had ahvays struck me that way.
There was something domesticated about it;
it seemed out of place here.
Took the turn a bit sharp, didn’t he?
Good old BroAvnie ! Good old Dogsbody !
Nose doAvn to it as usual; never would keep
his head up.
“Hi! Look where you’re going, you
Mulligan!”
Straightened up just in time! What the
hell did Brownie think he was doing!
Damn him! Making straight for the
horse-lines. He might have passed the
time of night to me!
The flashing of a lantern—stable picket
coming forAvard to meet him. ’Struth! Look
at the cart noAv !
Shickered! Too damned drunk to take
any notice of me, eh? They must have filled

yyjSY men o£ Commerce find in Hawaii that freedom which wearied
nerves demand ... of drowsy days under dreamy palms ... of
screaming-reel from lazing launch or bobbing outrigger ... of blissful
days on sporty greens.
In increasing numbers they seek the soothing calm of the short sea trip
that leads to this Island Paradise. . . the exhilaration that quickly
comes with the salt-sea tang . . . the restful ease of fine ocean liners,
whose standards are those of club and home.
They were the first to shatter seasonal distinctions ... to appreciate
a climate as free from heat as it is from cold. Now they go to Hawaii
the year round.
To-day an utterly different land, offering an entirely different vacation,
is yours to enjoy. The element of time is no longer an obstacle.

him up W ith rum up at the gun ! So that
was it!
Well, I’ll be damned! Coming along there
as tull as a tick, and here I’ve been worry-
ing over him all the while!
Lantern flashing about there like that—
what did the stable picket think they were
(lOing? And what was Brownie doing, stick-
mg’ there in the cart? Too damned drunk to
get out? What were they muttering about?
Snow Baxter —it was he who was holding
the lantern, wasn’t it? The two of them,
Lich and he—still looking into the cart.
Well, if Brownie was too drunk, why
couldnt they lift him out? But—took !
they had started to unharness Dogsbody—
look! But Brownie was still in the cart—
-1 d seen his legs stretched out on the foot-
board as the cart passed by.
What the devil? Here!
What was that Snow said? But—but
the way he called out, the way he called
out. Good God! Good God, no! What!—
What! Not ! Here, what were the odds?
-*■ d take a chance and slip across.
‘ It’s all right! It’s me, Snow. Anything
wrong?”
God! Look! Brownie! Brotvnie!
Snow; Tich —no wonder they couldn’t
speak! Brownie! The hood here—that
machine-gun, of course! —Right through the
hood somewhere here. And Brownie—his
head right back but his legs still stretched
out. Brownie ! O my God !
And Dogsbody—so Dogsbody had found
his own way back.
Brownie! And to think !
What was that Tich was saying now?
But, listen ! Look ! Yes ! The crowd was
coming back from the concert —see' Com-
ing along the road there! The officers—
they would be there, too! I couldn’t do any-
thing here —this was no excuse! I’d better
hurry off back to my post.
Only just in time! I’d better keep on the
move. Left-right-left! Left-right-left!
Listen! Further back along the road
there—that was a girl’s laugh'. That would
be Louise. Louise and Curly—coming along
in the rear there. And if Curly looked
across this way he would just about be
able to pick out the cook’s cart. He would
see it and then he would think that every-
thing was all right.
Curly! Louise! They—well, weren’t
worth it. To think, to think that Brownie!
lhat would be Captain Martin —yes. And
that silly fool of a
left-— SOillB ! keft-right-Jeft '■ Left-right-
Yes, all the officers had passed now. In
less than a minute they would know all
about it from the stable picket; and soon all
the chaps would be crowding around.
Already—look! No; I didn’t want to see
that,. I would move along to the far end
of the beat and halt there.
. Curly and Louise. Here they were, pass-
ing now He had his arm around her,
clidn t he. —-Look ! And, in a minute or so,
in less than that
Poor Curly! Yes, I was sorry for him
now! How would he take it when he found
out?
No, no, he doesn’t seem to have noticed
the group over there. Too much occupied,
eh? bee, he was passing the entrance. He
would be seeing Louise to the front door of
the farmhouse; that would be it.
From the look of things, everyone knew
now. Everyone except Curly.
I suppose he would be taking his time
saying good-niglit. No ; here he was. Most of
the crowd had dwindled away now, but on
his humpy Curly would be walking right
past, right past.
I would look straight in front of me; keep
011 looking in front of me for a while.
What a rotten end to the concert for the
chaps! This would put them out of sorts.
And on a night like this.
Louise! I had forgotten her for the
moment! The light shining now from the
attic window there. Louise—so she had
reached her room.
c „? r . ett y> Quite pretty, that light, wasn’t it?
Muning out through the chinks in those
shutters like that. Louise—and she was
ignorant of all this!
The horses getting restless. Kicking up
quite a fuss. Feeding-up time at last. Good!
It wouldn’t be long now before I was due
for relief. Yes, the stable pickets were on
the job. Is ice sort of a job, feeding a lot of
hungry horses in the dark. Only a single
horse-line, too—and no legropes. ‘it wasn’t
all beer and skittles, a driver’s lot. Quieten-
ing down now. And old Dogsbody would
have Ins nose well down into Ms nosebag
no doubt.
Curly—how has he taken it? I wonder if
he has thought of telling Louise? Hadn’t

btill there, that light. Seemed funny to
rhiuk that a girl was up there, didn’t it?
\V ltn ail these horses and men and ammuni-
tion-waggons here. Women took their time
over everything, didn’t they?' Even over a
Simple little thing like getting undressed.
Wonder if she was undressed by now?
Wonder what she looked like in her nightie?
* la< * a jolly fine figure, Louise. And
that lair hair of hers; it must look good
hanging loose.
Would she be saying her prayers, now, I
wonder? I suppose she did say her prayers.
Lord how long was it since I had said
mme! I had said a few the other night,
though, the time we got stuck when thev
were shelling the road. Yes—only because
I was afraid.
Would she be kneeling down alongside her
bed now, saying her prayers? More than
likely she would —and she knew nothing of
this!
Brownie—we would be burying him in the
morning. _ Wonder who he was writing to
this evening? Home to his people? Or did
he have—had he a girl way back in Aussie’
And to think that old Dogsbody found his
way back like that. Still, there Was nothing-
very remarkable about it. The queerest
thing was that no one seemed to have noticed
that he was coming along, undriven. Still,
he would have come along by the short cut'
of course; wouldn’t have passed the cross-
roads, where the traffic was.
Ah ! Thought I heard someone over there!
Somebody making towards the back of the
farmhouse, eh? Yes —towards the back of
the farmhouse. There, in the pool of light
thrown from the window there —Curly!
Yes, it was Curly. So —so he was going to
tell Louise, now? But, look, he had stopped !
He was still standing there. Couldn’t
quite make up his mind about it —was that
it? Didn’t know whether to tell her now,
or not?
Look! Now he had turned, and was mak-
ing back! Yes, making back towards the
humpies, right enough!
Poor devil! Yes —but what had made
him turn back? I wonder now? Would
that be it? This affair —had it brought him
to his senses? Had this made him see
Louise in her true light? A shallow sort
of girl, all said and done, Louise. Never
had thought much of Curly; but even Curly
was a bit too good for her.
Yes, when you look at it that way, per-
haps _ some good has come out of all this.
Things quietened down a lot there in
front. Nothing doing at all now. Just
occasional flares soaring up.
This bit of a strafe —wonder what it has
cost? Wonder how many poor beggars have
gone west? And just on this little scrap of
a front.
Queer! Any other night I wouldn’t be
thinking of that. Would just take it all
tor granted. But to-night—Brownie.
Because of Brownih, I suppose.
Wonder who his people were? I could
find out, of course. Yes ; in a way, I’d
like to write to them and tell them the full
circumstances of his death. It was such
a decent thing lie did —and they ought to
know about it. And yet, on the other hand
—yes, it might give a touch of bitterness to
heir loss. It might seem to them so futile
that Brownie’s death should have come about
in this way. And yet—it was such a bonzer
thing he did. If I were to let them know
some time later, perhaps? I must think it
over.
Must be about due for my relief. Yes—•
only seven minutes to go. Wish I had an
illuminated watch like this. Lazy devil,
Bombardier Bell. “Here, you can borrow
my watch and work your own reliefs,” he
had said. Just like Bell!
Only seven minutes to go—five minutes,
really counting the time it would take me
to dig out Nuts Wilson.
Oh, no, I’d give him the benefit of those
two minutes; I would see out the full time.
I would be having four hours’ rest, too. On
again from four till six.
Better pad up and down the beat for a
while. A fair thing was a fair thing.
* * * *
Over there; —just the first signs of the dawn.
More than half an hour to wait yet
though. Jingo ! Wasn’t it cold now ! Ever
since four o’clock I seem to have been doing
nothing else but trying to keep warm.
And those cursed frogs in the pond across
the road were at it still!
Talk about getting on a man’s nerves!
h or two pins I’d fire a shot into the pond!
.1 hat might shut them up for a while But
I couldn’t very well do that; it would bring
the whole place about me.
Still at it! Going their damnedest! And
there hadn’t been a sound out of them when
I was on” before. What had come over
them to keep on croaking like this? What
had got into their heads? What made frogs
decide to croak? And why should the whole
crowd of them keep on croaking like this’
Queer thing Nature. Queer thing life.
Much more of it, and I'd—well, what
would I do?
Now, how. about that? —slip across the
load there, pick up a few stones, and throw
them into the pond? Yes; but it would
mean leaving my post.
Who was going to steal the cursed wag-
gons. anyway? What was the harm done?
Of course, if I
Oh, hang it all! Chance the odds! Better
be lively about it, though.
It hadn’t taken me long to reach the
road, anyhow.
Thought I heard someone! There, by the
front door of the farmhouse there. The old
man was setting off to hi s patch of beet
mighty early this morning, wasn’t he? What
a regular old grafter he was! You couldn’t
beat him, could you?
But, God in Heaven, look! Look! That
wasn’t the old man ; that was, that was—
Jacques ! Making qff -along the road there
now— J deques !
Jacques! And to think, to think! Here,
where was my rifle—quick J
Steady, you fool! —steady !
His hands in his pockets now, making off
along the road there—Jacques!
Near Polperro.
Quick steps upon the tufted grass:
I saw you pass,
Trampling the sea-pinks down
With ruthless feet.
Behind you lay,
Piled street on street,
The dim, old rain-beleaguered town,
With masts beside the granite quay,
And gulls along the slimy hulls
Screaming derisively.
And for one breath I watched you there,
Beside the swooping harbor road,
A scarlet kerchief on your hair,
Your shoulders bowed beneath a load.
Then suddenly
I saw your face,
Coquettish, with a hood of lace
(Black lace, black eyes and blue-black
hair!),
Hang ghostly on the sparkling air.
There was no sea;
The town was gone;
The grass your feet had trampled on!
Pale walls reared close behind you where
A Spanish street dreamed still and fair.
I saw the stones of old Castile
Show white through orange-lanterned boughs,
And you were tapping toe and heel,
With whispering lace along your brows.
The tambourines rang shrilly sweet;
You laughed a gipsy laugh and shook
A wisp of scarlet from your hand,
I dared not look.
Around your feet
Lay fresh-spilled blood and trampled sand!
And then, all suddenly,
The sea
Surged up; the wind
Blew through the hollows thistle-lined,
And bent the sea-pinks in a whirl.
A gull cried out in swift alarm.
You passed, your basket on your arm
A stolid Cornish fisher-girl!
