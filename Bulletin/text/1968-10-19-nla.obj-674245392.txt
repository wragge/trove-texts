Tippers made from Comalco aluminium out-carry,
out-last other metal bodies!
Name the load blue metal, coal, sand
or loam an aluminium tipper beats other
materials hollow! You benefit from greater
durability, longer life, maximum resistance to
abrasion. Comalco aluminium is rust-free,
and there’s virtually no maintenance
needed. Profit from the experience of
Brambles Industries. Their aluminium tipper
shown here has travelled 25,000 miles in its
six months’ life to date, averaging 9 cwt.
extra payload per journey. This means
that 5,625 additional ton/miles have been
gained over a tipper constructed of
conventional materials. They’re getting
cleaner load discharge, faster turn-around
and lower fuel consumption. Makes sense to
choose aluminium? They think so. Contact
the Transport Industries Representative
at your local Comalco Sales Office for

FOLLOWING A LINE
AS A SERVICE to parliamentarians
in doubt, a Canberra firm of architects
has sent a round-robin letter inviting
members to telephone them for a con-
sultation with a senior partner if they
have trouble deciding where the future
Parliament House should be sited. So
strong has been the response, we hear,
that the firm has had to have a
recorded message prepared. This tells
callers, “Your decision for the hill has
been unwise; please think again and
decide on the lake.”
LETHAL WEAPON
ACCORDING to recent reports, Aus-
tralian defence scientists have succeeded
in transmitting continuous television
programs over a pencil-thin blue laser
beam. The success of this as a weapon
would depend entirely on the programs
chosen, although at the moment there
seems no lack of deadly offerings.
COUNTING THE PENNIES
IN THE CURRENT fuss raised by
the State about the refusal of the Com-
monwealth to hand back a reasonable
proportion of the money it collects in
taxes, it is reassuring to know that
the States are leaving no stone un-
turned to add to their revenues. The
Incomes Tax Commissioner for New
South Wales, for example, collected $37
in the past financial year; this was
from defaulters for the period before
1941 when the Com,monwealth took
over collecting income tax for
everybody.
LEFT AT THE POST
THE BRITISH POST OFFICE has
inaugurated Britain’s new-type pillar
box by posting a letter to Sir Anthony
Trollope, of Roseville Avenue, Rose-
ville, New South Wales. But will Aus-
tralia’s old-type mailmen ever get it
to him?
MANY VOICES
SURROUNDED by all the chi-chi
associated with the opening of an art
exhibition, one purist at the opening of
Arts Vietnam in Sydney last week was
heard to say he preferred his protest
without such selfconscious respectability.
But for most people, respectability was
the most refreshing element about Arts
Vietnam — so often has any form of
dissent been dismissed out of hand by
the public in the past as an activity
patently lacking in it.
Arts Vietnam was spread over a
week, beginning with the exhibition at
Gallery A, and taking in a rhythm-and-
blues concert at Paddington Town Hall
and drama, poetry readings, music, folk-
music and jazz at the Teachers’
Federation Hall. The aim was implicit
protest against the war in Vietnam,
but for most of the programs overt
propaganda was kept to a minimum,
contained usually in short speeches
before the performances.
The art exhibition was like any other
,opening too crowded to see the
paintings, and with people more inter-
ested in one another, anyway. But
there was one lengthy pause in conver-
sation, when Professor Bernard Smith,
of Sydney University’s Department of
Fine Arts, opened the exhibition with
a speech about artists and social
involvement. He had returned from a
three-month trip to Europe and the
United States impressed with a new
sense of political involvement among
artists.
“It differs in style from the involve-
ment of the old Left of the 19305,”
he said. “Then involvement meant the
politicisation of art, its use as a
vehicle of a political message. The new
dissent is not tied to a party, is often
implacably uncompromising, cuts across
stylistic divisions, and sees the creative
artist as actively and provocatively
involved in social change both in his
art and in his life. This total commit-
ment to change is a radical contrast to
the quietism of the 19505.
“There is considerable diversity of
styles embraced by the exhibition. I do
Peter O’Shaughness[?]y ...from
Thucydides to “The Sydney Morning
Herald ”
not doubt that an equally wide
diversity of political opinions con-
cerning the issues involved in the Viet-
nam War are also represented. For
many artists exhibiting here all wars
are totally evil. They are consistent
pacifists.
“For some the suppression of all
forms of political liberty that would
almost certainly follow the complete
triumph of the Viet Cong is only
slightly less hateful than the present
murderous carnage. The issues, in short,
are not simple ones. But we all feel
there has been too much killing, torture,
and bestiality in this false holy war,
and that it was time it was stopped.”
Russell Drysdale, Charles Blackman,
Frank Hodgkinson, lan Fairweather,
and Arthur and David Boyd were
among 52 painters who exhibited,
prices ranged from $4000 for
Australian Facade 3, by Lloyd Rees,
to drawings and lithographs for $50
and upwards, and red spots denoting
sales appeared on several before the end
of the evening. The artists are donating
a percentage of sales to Arts Vietnam,
and any profits will help pay the fares
of speakers who came from abroad to
the seminar on Asian-Australian
relations held in Sydney later in the
week by the Association for Inter-
national Co-operation and Disarma-
ment. .
Folk-music is traditionally the pro-
testors’ medium, but drama, poetry, and
modern music drew equally large
crowds. Composers Peter Sculthorpe
and Anne Boyd wrote new compositions
for the occasion and Richard Meale
presented a vintage piece of music
done when he was 20. “It was naive
but well intentioned,” he said.
One of the dangers of protest is a
descent into smug earnestness, and Arts
Vietnam was not immune from it, but
on most occasions comedy was the
saving grace. It was comedy which
seemed to stay on in the mind — like
a Canberra poet’s contribution to the
poetry evening, an irreverent comic
poem about the royal family, and
readings from Joseph Heller’s novel
“Catch 22” during the drama
performance.
This was made up of a collection
of extracts from a variety of sources
— from Thucydides to the “Sydney
Morning Herald” — compiled and
directed by Michael Boddy and Aarne
Neeme, and read by 14 actors, including
Peter O’Shaughnessy, Max Meldrum,
John Unicomb, and Doreen Warburton.
There was even a vague echo of
Barry Humphries and his “gladi-
waving” finales. At the end of the first
half of the program the lights went
up and the audience was incited to
sing “The Aeroplane Jelly Song” to
an accompaniment of recorded gunfire.
Predictably, perhaps, fewer voices were
raised than “gladis” had been during
the Humphries shows. — SANDRA

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
opening of the $1 million publishing
house at Dee Why, Sydney (balloons
released en masse from the top of Aus-
tralia Square, arrivals by helicopter,
champagne, and a caterer more at home
on the gourmet circuit). This time, the
occasion was Australia’s introduction to
the Hamlyn record label, “Music for
Pleasure,” which offers LPs at $1.99.
The setting was Australia Square,
where, as Hamlyn said, pieces of
fractured balloons are still emerging
from the air-conditioning. Food and
drink were again on hand, as was the
Premier, Mr. Askin, and gifts of red
plastic attache cases filled with trios
of LPs. In case you didn’t like your
gift, record racks were available for
surreptitious exchanges.
Mr. Hamlyn seems to be making his
musical debut in Australia with a
noticeable bias toward safe standards
and schmaltz. Gracie Fields, “The 1812
Overture,” “Swan Lake,” the Tijuana
Brass, and Nat King Cole were much
in evidence, with Joan Hammond,
Gladys Moncrieff, and organist Wilbur
Kentwell making up the Australian
content. A collection of Judith Wright’s
poems was a notable exception to all
this.
ROUNDABOUT
COLLEEN CLIFFORD, the tiny
English-born producer of the Indepen-
dent Theatre’s current children’s play,
has been on something of a theatrical
roundabout since she won a scholarship
to the Royal Academy of Music at 17.
In those days, the idea was that she
would become a concert pianist, but
acting seemed to entail less drudgery
and a little more fun, so she organised
revues for charity, which led to oppor-
tunities in musical comedy, dra'ma, and,
later, Shakespeare. She came to Aus-
tralia for a six-week holiday after the
death of her husband in 1957, but six
weeks stretched into 12 years, because
she established a theatre, the Theatre
Guild of Perth.
“That really came about because of
the ambitious mother of a 14-year-old
I was coaching in drama,” she says.
“She was anxious her daughter should
do well, and she suggested I start a
teaching academy, so we held an ‘at
home’ — and at the end of the evening
we had 72 people enrolled. The 14-year-
old, Sandra O’Neill, is now playing the
lead in an off-Broadway production of
‘Funny Girl’.”
The academy had its beginning in a
borrowed clubroom, spread to a 150-
seat theatre (“We built our own
.stage”),. then, in a burst of optimistic
enthusiasm, “we took over 72,000
spare feet of concrete where they used
to sell cars and built the biggest stage
in any small theatre in the Southern
Hemisphere. Sounds grand when you
put it like that, doesn’t it?” she says,
liking the phrase. The actors weren’t
professional to start with, but later they
became contract players here and in
England.
She left the theatre in February to
co’me to Sydney to be with her mother,
who is ill, and now divides her time
between the Independent, where she
teaches four classes a week, the Univer-
sity of N.S.W. (five classes), and the
drama lessons she gives actors in her
house at Paddington.
She is bustling, delicately extrovert,
with the kind of clear, ringing voice
which reaches the last row in the back
stalls without being raised and she is
full of “theatre” in the grand and
traditional sense of the word.
“The thing is, so few actors here
have been taught ‘style.’ At the Inde-
pendent, I take special classes in style
Restoration;, Chekhov, Oscar Wilde,
Coward, Brecht each is a style in
itself. Some actors here have done lots
of modern plays, but put them in a
classic role and they’re lost. You can
only put new and different interpreta-
tions on something when you know it
thoroughly. In England, I used to do
television burlesques of serious pianists,
French singers, and opera singers, but I
couldn’t have done them if I hadn’t
been these things.”

Courage lapel pin, and my gift pack of
Courage stubbies and cans.
Courage and their British stalwarts
kept everything top secret from the day
they first announced they would build
a brewery in Melbourne. That was
November 2, 1966. The publicity tide
first broke on Tuesday, October 8.
On that day Sir Maurice Nathan,
chairman of directors of Courage,
took delivery of 25 red-and-gold Inter-
national trucks, bearing the Courage
emblem, from International Harvester
at Geelong. Then they drove them to
Melbourne in military convoy and
straight up Swanston Street right
toward the Carlton Brewery. It was
the finest example of raw power since
the Germans moved into the Sudeten-
land. Carlton, one felt, should have
had 25 Fosters Lager and Melbourne
Bitter trucks moving back the other
way in an act of confrontation, but
this did not come to pass.
Then C-day was Wednesday, October
9. First deliveries were made to hotels
at 5 a.m., and truly devoted radio
roundsmen were on the job at 5.30 a.m.
giving stirring on-the-spot “I was there”
accounts of tastings of Courage.
The Press invitations for C-day
were for 10.30 a.m. out at the
<sB-million brewery at Broadmeadows.
Your correspondent has covered many
openings fibro - plaster factories,
printeries, brickworks, soup canneries,
instant-potato masheries, and almost
invariably the TV-radio newspaper
spread has been thin. But could one
comment on the dedication with which
this event was covered? Could one
comment on the personal sacrifice of
time displayed by so many highly
trained people on this occasion?
Not only did the newspapers send
full teams, but there were TV editors,
editors of agricultural journals, sporting
editors, real-estate writers, lady social
writers, cartoonists, proprietors of trade
papers.
The Courage men were all lined up,
most of them very well English-suited,
“I think he’s ready to start peace
negotiations!”
all, of course, with the golden cockerel
on their lapels. The most impressive
was the managing director of Courage
Barclay and Simmonds from London.
He was slim, grey-haired, and .looked
like one of the old “man of distinction”
ads. He had a magnificent name —Mr.
Hereward Swallow.
Sir Maurice Nathan, a former Lord
Mayor, managing director of Patersons
Furniture House, and now Courage
chairman, did all the talking. It was
most interesting that he never actually
mentioned Carlton. It was always “the
opposition” or “the other brewery.”
One felt that this was protocol, like
talking of the Senate in the House of
Representatives. And Sir Maurice
Nathan had almost the lofty manner
of Sir Robert Menzies in referring to
“the other place.”
Oh, he was mt>st poetic. When he
talked of their secrecy period, they had
“hooded the cockerel,” and, for heaven’s
sake, he even broke into verse:
Life is mostly froth and bubble,
Two things stand like stone,
Any beer in any glass,
But always Courage in your own.
By 11.15 a.m. some of the assembled
gathering thought that to give proper
authentic coverage to their various
publications they should by now have
tasted the product, but no, to the tune
of a few whimpers of despair, Sir
Maurice announced that there would
be a 45-minute tour of the “most
modern brewery anywhere,” “the trend-
setter for all breweries in Australia to
come.”
Actually, the brewery was quite
imposing, even though a gentleman
from the other place had said: “It’s
about the size of our brewery in Fiji.”
One noted first its location, off
Sydney Road behind the Ford factory,
so schoolchildren on geography excur-
sions will be able to do a combined
operation, first Ford and then Courage.
The various areas had imposing
names—“ Brew House,” “Bottling Hall”
—and all was clinical, automated, and
beautiful, tanks painted a pale green,
pumps in sweet lolly-pink, and pipes all
in stainless steel. The brewer sat in
front of a three-sided control panel like
a spaceman on his way to Venus. There
were lights, dials, and levers, although
the production manager, David Watson,
explained that it was all quite simple,
really. “It works on the same system as
a Hoover Keymatic washing machine,”
said he.
In the automatic clinical paradise,
staff hardly existed, so it was a com-
fort to discover two characters in a
vintage Charlie Chaplin-style job. Their
job was to sit and see that beer was
up to the right level in every bottle.
They were like cricket umpires look-
ing for run-outs. If the beer wasn’t up
to the line they were out.
At 12 noon we went back to the
lounge-bar area. All four TV channels
wanted interviews with Sir Maurice
standing in front of the bar, which de-
layed the ceremonial opening of
Courage barrel “No. 1” for another 30
minutes.
Television at Press conferences has
never been popular. There is a genuine
belief that not only the interviewing
by Max Factored commentators but
also the paraphernalia of lights, wires,
and cameras interferes with the legiti-
mate desire of newspaper reporters to
get the real news. This feeling at
Courage showed signs of developing
into a Mexican riot. “If they don’t
get their bloody cameras out of the
way in a minute I’ll kill the bastards,”
said a “Daily” man. “I’m giving them
two minutes and I’m going to rush
the flipping bar,” said a trade journal.
Even a social editress threatened to do
something unseemly. Finally, a “Daily”
man did a superb flanking movement
around the bar and grabbed some
glasses under several thousand candle
power, and it was on, the time 12.40.
What was the beer like? There were
no unkind words about it. Most of the
newspapermen who tried it claimed
it was a distinctly different beer, but
I would like to see how they would go
if it were masked. Brian Fogarty,
President of the Melbourne Chapter of
the Beer Appreciation Society, called
an extraordinary meeting to test the
new beer. The feeling of the panel was
that it was lighter, paler, even tastier
beer than Carlton, with a remarkable
similarity to Swan and Emu of Western
Australia. Another comment was that,
because of its lightness, it would be
better as a shampoo for setting the
hair, and women’s hairdressers would
appreciate it.
Meanwhile, the La Trobe Library
dug out an old Troedel poster for
Elliott’s brewery at Deniliquin, which
started in 1883 and supplied most of
the beer for the Riverina. Its emblem
was a golden cockerel. Exactly the same
as that of Courage. What happened to
Elliott’s Brewery? It was swallowed by
Carlton some time around 1922.
Let us hope this does not happen to
the cockerel again. This is a very
pleasant new era.

Nerve System of an Airplane: A report from General Dynamics
Next time you take a trip in your car, try
to drive there without steering wheel,
accelerator or brakes.
Impossible, of course. They are vital
to the job. Without them, the car won’t
do what it must, even though the chassis,
body, motor, power train, tires, fuel,
driver—and passengers —are all there.
The function of any vehicle is to de-
liver something from one place to
another. The family car is a passenger-
delivering system. A military aircraft is
a weapons-delivering system. Avionics
are vital to that job.
Extending human will:
In a modern military aircraft, the hu-
man crew is the intellect and the will.
Avionics—or what used to be called
aviation-electronics—are its nervous sys-
tem, extending the human will through
machines for tasks that require accurate
control, sustained precise effort, or ultra-
fast computation.
Here are some of the things current
avionics do:
• Provide exact and unjammable navi-
gation.
• Help the crew fly smoothly and safely,
so low that detection and tracking capa-
bility of enemy radar will be sharply
reduced, or so high and fast that it can
circumvent other forms of attack.
• Assist the easy transition from one
flight regime to another,
• Detect potential sources of attack from
air or ground.
• Help fire any combination of weap-
onry with precision.
The F-l 11 fighter-bomber being built
by General Dynamics is a case in point.
The F-lll’s variable-sweep wing,
which makes it possible to redesign the
aircraft in flight, is one of the great
aerodynamic advances.
This airplane can fly fast or slow; 12
miles high or skimming the treetops;
drift through the air for hours, or attack
at two and a half times the speed of
sound; ferry itself across an ocean with-
out refueling, and land or take off from
rough tactical fields in short distances.
All in all, it is the most versatile air-
craft ever designed.
But first and foremost it is a weapons-
delivery system. Its avionics, much more
sophisticated than those of earlier air-
planes, are a good indication of what is
required nowadays.
A generation ago, aviation-electron-
ics consisted mainly of radio. Today’s
avionics include a large assortment of
separate systems which are segments
of a larger fully integrated electronic
system. This, in turn, is integrated with
the airframe, the engines and weaponry.
To see how it ties together, look at a
few of the F-l 1 l’s avionics parts.
The triply redundant, self-adaptive
flight-control system relates directly to
the unique ability of the F-l 11 to vary
the way it flies.
A complex of electronic sensors and
computers measures motions of the air-
craft and commands, through hydraulic
and mechanical components, any neces-
sary compensation to control surfaces.
In case of sudden change in atmos-
pheric conditions (i.e., clear air turbu-
lence or strong gusts), or rapid shift in
altitude or direction, the self-adaptive
flight-control system will automatically
make any necessary adjustments for
pitch, roll or yaw—often before pilots
even know they are needed.
When wings change position, changes
in other control surfaces take place si-
multaneously. The plane never loses its
desirable flying qualities at any speed,
Seeing, hearing and feeling devices receive and transmit impressions to crew
and electronic centers, which interpret data and in turn command immediate
and proper physical responses. Information flows in both directions among
many interconnections, only a few of which are indicated symbolically here.

ox change in speed, from takeoff through
Mach 2.5.
An inertial navigation system elimi-
nates the uncertainties inherent in earlier
magnetic-compass, radio or radar navi-
gation techniques.
The inertial system measures every
inch of passage, fluctuation in direction
or change in speed. At any given mo-
ment, the pilot knows precisely where
he is in relation to his takeoff point, his
target and his return base.
“Hideability”:
Terrain-following radar (TFR) improves
mission efficiency.
A fast low-flying airplane which can
be “seen” only fleetingly is troublesome
for ground search radar. For maximum
“hideability,” the aircraft’s terrain-fol-
lowing radar can be set at an optimum
clearance close to the ground. The plane
can now dip into the valleys and skim
the peaks at supersonic speed in any
weather, day or night. It can keep on a
direct path, yet make the enemy’s prob-
lem of detection far more difficult.
The TFR constantly looks both down
and ahead, and relays its information to
the self-adaptive control system. The
complex adjusts the entire aircraft far
faster than could unassisted human re-
flexes. Even over particularly jagged
territory, the ride is relatively smooth.
The pilot can fly through zero visibil-
ity, protected against physical obstruc-
tions ahead. Should any of the TFR’s
circuits fail, the overall avionic system
is programmed to put the aircraft auto-
matically into a very sharp climb to
higher altitude.
The ultimate function of the F-111,
however, is the delivery of weapons —a
mix of many types, long and short-range,
for defense and attack, with different
methods of firing. This calls for three
closely related systems.
Finding a target:
A bomb/navigation system, connected
to every weapon, constantly measures
the plane’s speed, altitude, attitude and
position. These are computed against
information, already stored, on the par-
ticular drop or firing pattern of each
weapon and the location of the target.
A “head-up” system projects flight
and other data, in color bar form, to a
transparent reflective plate at pilot’s eye
level. Through it, he can see all the in-
formation necessary to fire guns and
missiles without moving his eyes from
the target itself.
To extend his sight in bad weather or
at night, high resolution ground map-
ping radar provides a clear picture of
the terrain or of airborne targets, simul-
taneously reporting the changing range
between plane and target.
With these reinforcing the pilot’s
judgment, the specific weapon needed
can be released, manually or automati-
cally, at the split second when it is most
likely to hit its target exactly.
Each of the “separate” systems has a
distinct job, yet all are, to some degree,
interdependent. For maximum reliabil-
ity, self-test devices check, before and
all during flight, for any malfunction.
Should one occur, the “work” can be
shifted quickly to back-up equipment—
and assure that the mission will not be
impaired.

pany of scientists, engineers
and skilled workers whose

field of technology, and who

in fact, Mr. Hannan did four or five
years ago for National Health Week at
the Sydney Town Hall. He had a
terrible time with the main line, which
blew off the pump, and had to buy a
baking dish from Horderns, which
miraculously rectified the matter. He
and Mrs. Hannan still have the baking
dish.
Then again, if one’s backyard is in
Bellevue Hill, in the Eastern Suburbs
of Sydney, the price is higher than,
say, North Ryde, on the North Shore,
where the Hannans live. It costs $l5O
a load to bring rock and deliver in situ
here, compared with $65 a load there.
For the simple reason that Mr. Hannan
has further to travel, and rock his
kind of red sandstone rock, that is
which is fragile and bagged against
damage and comes from a secret spot
50 miles out of Sydney, has to be
handled like velvet. No rushing over
the Harbor Bridge at 70 mph. Some-
times, the speed he goes, it’s like taking
part in the “Wages of Fear.”
“Actually,” says Mrs. Hannan, “John
is a rock-conscious man. We never
drive anywhere without him looking for
fresh supplies. You can’t just take rock.
You have to ask owners of properties
if they \Vant to sell.” This reminds
her husband of the time he found one
exactly like a turtle. They do resemble
wildlife, he says, provided one uses
one’s imagination. There are platypus
rocks, koala rocks they’ve got one

there are mushroom rocks which make
marvellous garden seats, boomerang
rocks, and there are map-of-Australia
rocks. This turtle rock, though. He
offers the man $8 cash for it. Not $8

The man wants $2O. Next day someone
has smashed the turtle’s head off. It

ing a cigarette in sorrow.

sorrow. Tonight, for instance, the tele-
phone rings non-stop with workmen
checking that tomorrow’s simple $2OOO
landscape at Edgecliff is going ahead.
Then the rock supplier says would it
be all right if they put it off for a
week? Would it hell. Mr. Hannan is
tearing his hair. Clients don’t realise
the organisation that goes into it. If he
has to make one call checking details
he has to make 60. All clients see is Mr.
Hannan swooshing around in his crane
directing a crew of men with the
authority of a soldier, which he once
was at Victoria Barracks, Paddington,
when he gardened officially for the
Army and landscaped for rich civilians
on the side. Eas'.ern Suburbs wives are
particularly irritating. They stand
around and watch, then engage him in
idle gossip. He tells them to go away
and then sees them peering out from
behind their french-pleated raw silk
curtains. Then he gets the crackpots
from Vaucluse who want the color of
their drawing-room carried right on into
the garden. For harmony, you know.
Another source of irritation is the
wife who turns his landscape into what
he calls a Friendship Garden, which is
when Mrs. Bloggs up the road presents
her with a few flowers to plant in his
rocks. He tears them out at once. You
have not, he shouts, paid all that good
money for nothing. Neither has he gone
through his six-point plan, which is
(1) consultation, (2) survey, (3) draft
sketches, (4) final sketches, (5) order-
ing of electrical and water reticulation
and concrete work, and (6) final plans
like a house, for it all to be ruined by
a clump of pansies. “John says,” pipes
up Mrs. Hannon, “that the perfect
client commissions the job, pays at
once, and keeps a steady flow of tea
going all day.” Well, he' can’t com-
plain too much. He’s had some lovely
clients in the past. Going right back to
those days when he was Sergeant (Mis-
cellaneous), roughly eight years ago, he
has beautified the backyards of several
big names. The Gowings’ store daugh-
ter, Mrs. Isabel Fell, at Pymble for one,
she’s a lovely lady. Then Dick Cribben,
the American margarine king at Castle-
crag. He’s done his place, his aunt’s
place, his manager’s place, his sister-in-
law’s place, and his factory. About
$32,000 in toto. Also a lovely person.

trick Levy’s at Palm Beach. Currently
he is looking for a rock seat for Mrs.
Levy, who stood by the swimming-pool
one morning and thought what a pity
she couldn’t sit there and admire it.
Mr. Hannan has got a beauty lined up
for her.
It hasn’t happened to him yet, but
another aspect of all this is that some-
one might get the idea not to pay his

HOW TO BE AUSTRALIAN IN LONDON
Comment by ‘Observer’
THIS WEEK the British take what
may be one of their final steps to-
ward fully recognising that “abroad”
is not split up between “Imperial”
and “Foreign.” The Foreign Office and
the Commonwealth Relations Office
become one, joined together as the
cumbrously entitled “Foreign and
Commonwealth Office.” That they
wouldn’t go the whole way and
simply call it an External Affairs
Office is a sign that thinking in the
British Government about the Com-
monwealth has not proceeded as far
as it has among other Common-
wealth governments. They neither
want to make something of it (which
would mean a decentralisation in
which the names of government build-
ings in London were not significant);
nor are they prepared to give it up.
However, it will be of advantage
to Britain itself that its Government
no longer has an official policy of
dual vision when it looks at the world.
There have been some terrible mess-
ups in the past for the British in not
being able to deal with the world in
one piece, and to most of the Common-
wealth governments there is an advan-
tage in being able to plug in to British
foreign policy direct, instead of
through systems of pretence.
A sound but unlikely follow-up
would be to stop calling heads of
missions between Commonwealth
countries High Commissioners and to
call them Ambassadors instead. That
Ambassadors represent heads of State
and that a few Commonwealth
countries still share the British
monarch is no barrier to this change.
In the case of Australia, for instance,
the Australian Ambassador in London
could represent the Queen in her
capacity as Queen of Australia and
nevertheless be accredited to her in
her capacity as Queen of the United
Kingdom. This is the kind of make-
believe that can coqie as second
nature to the British. The present
nomenclature seems to suggest that
Australia bears a special relationship
to Tanzania, for instance, that it does
not bear to Indonesia. This is ridiculous.
What should now be done as Aus-
tralia’s contribution to better under-
standing between Britain and Australia
is to professionalise diplomatic relations
between these two nations. The head of
the Australian mission in London has
never been a man of diplomatic train-
ing or a man with an understanding of
the diplomatic role. His job has usually
been seen simply as a matter of getting
on with the British. Australian High
Commissioners have not been expected
nor usually have they known how
—to go about getting close contact
with the heads of other diplomatic
missions in London; they have not
usually acted as if the relations between
Britain and Australia were relations
between independent powers with some-
times conflicting interests; and, since
they have not even been part of the
diplomatic service, but have been
responsible to the Prime Minister, they
have often been ignorant of general
Australian foreign policy and have
sometimes spoken in contradiction of it.
This does not mean that they must
necessarily be career diplomats. But it
does seem to mean that they should
work as part of the External Affairs
Department, which has no doubt devel-
oped its own methods of telling
amateurs how to do their jobs. For a
start, however, it would seem essential
to appoint a career diplomat (or a
former External Affairs Minister) just
to get things on a proper footing
and, one hopes, to retrench some of the
enormous staff Australia maintains in
London.
The present Prime Minister is said
to be suspicious of the External Affairs
Department. Even so, he should prove
himself man enough to hand con-
trol of the Australian High Com-
mission in London over to the External
Affairs Department, where it belongs,
and ask the’m to give some sense of
proportion to an over-expanded Aus-
tralia House. Surely a Prime Minister
is powerful enough and has enough
prestige without hanging on to this
little bit of control. It can be a mark
of greatness in leadership to give up
little things and to concentrate on
what matters most.
When Sir Robert Menzies was Prime
Minister it fitted his world view that he
should directly control relations with
London. As a self-professed Australian
nationalist, Mr. Gorton must see that
he should be taking the opposite view.
Merely as an act of symbolism of the
changing times it would be of value for
him to indicate that Australia wanted
more normal relations with Britain.
And since Mr. Gorton appears to
want to re-organise the Prime Minis-
ter’s Department as a staff that can
more adequately help him preside over
the affairs of the nation, he must see
that neither he nor it should have par-
ticular tasks of administration that are
likely to take up its time and con-
fuse its vision. The Australian High
Commission in London is only one
of several special responsibilities that
have accreted to the Prime Minister’s
Department. It might be better if the
whole lot were scraped off and given to
other departments.
FALLOUT FROM THE TARIFF REPORT
Comment by Alan Reid
THE DEMOCRATIC LABOR
PARTY provided the political drama
last week with its threat to switch its
preferences from Government to ALP
candidates in selected electorates. But
it was the Tariff Board which provided
the real political dynamite.
The Tariff Board produced its
annual report, a lengthy document of
140 pages which, in essence, said that
the Board proposed to recommend
action to the Government to deal with
uneconomic and over-protected second-
ary industries.
The Tariff Board has listed on 60
pages goods which represent industries
operating under tariff protection.
Fifteen of the pages cover goods on
which the significant ad valorem tariff
rate is 30 percent or under. Twenty
pages deal with goods or industries in
the 31 to 50 percent class. The
balance are in the 50 percent-and-over
class. Across the board they represent
a very substantial range of Australian
secondary industry.
The Board has also announced that
it proposes a systematic review by
public inquiry of the main areas of
production, concentrating initially on
those where protection is in the high
or medium range. Comments the
Board, “In the case of areas of
production which are found to have
little prospect of operating with an
effective rate below 50 percent, the
Board would riot recommend protec-
tion sufficient to allow the industries
concerned to compete for resources on

,
rnnsiderahle^pa^ represents to
considerable degree the approach of a
number of the Liberals, including the-
Treasurer, William McMahon, the
Treasury itself, a number of Country
Part parliamentarians and probably
including the Deputy CP Leader Doug
Anthony, the bulk of Country Party
rank-and-file voters. They cannot see
how the cost of what they term ineffi-
cient or over - protected secondary
industries can continue to be loaded
on Australian primary industries with-

out crippling the export potential of
these industries.
The Board’s approach is diametrically
opposed to that of the Country Party
Leader, John McEwen, the Trade
Department, and a number of Liberals.
McEwen’s view is that Australian
expansion cannot be continued at its
present pace without secondary industry
providing the jobs for a growing popu-
lation, which our now highly
mechanised primary industry cannot
provide. He views primary industry as
the external-currency earner and
secondary industry as the provider
of employment for the migration intake
and the increasing local labor force.
The Board’s report would be interest-
ing, politically, even if all it did was to
drive a wedge into the Government’s
ranks, already deeply divided on this
tariff issue. But it goes much further
than that. It is a bread-and-butter
question, and when bread and butter
are at stake ideological preferences are
likely to be thrown out of the window.
The manufacturers (and it has to
be reme'mbered that they are very, very
important when it comes to the ques-
tion of collecting Party funds) are
alarmed. In normal circumstances
Labor’s Dr. Jim Cairns, of Melbourne,
socialist and architect of Labor’s anti-
Vietnam policy, would be a political
ogre to the conservative manufacturers.
But he is rapidly becoming their hero.
After Cairns had expressed strong sus-
picion of what the Tariff Board was
up to with its declaration that “the
Board would aim at least to contain
industries in the high-cost area,” the
Federal President of the Associated
Chambers of Manufactures, Mr. W. W.
Pettingell, went publicly on record:
“Dr. Cairns ... at least clearly under-
stands the position.”
If the manufacturers were pursuing
a narrower self-interest they could be
ignored politically, but workers who
produce behind a tariff barrier can
have their fears about the future of
their jobs worked upon, particularly if
the industries in which they work get
a mention in the Tariff Board’s lists.
The manufacturers are in a position to
work upon those fears, and also the
fear of the numerous shopkeepers,
tradesmen, and others who live off the
backs of those who work in protected
industries.
Prime Minister John Gorton—under-
standably—tried to minimise the signifi-
cance of the Board’s report. He told
the Parliament that the Government
had no intention of changing its tariff
policy (which broadly has been Mc-
Ewen’s high-protection, job-creating
policy).
But the manufacturers are highly
suspicious. As Pettingell sees it: “The
new role which the Tariff Board has
set itself is one in which it exercises a
coercive pressure upon the Government
in an attempt to establish new guide-
lines in tariff making.”
The DLP, with its truculence, pro-
vided Gorton with a headache. The
Tariff Board report could be elector-
ally much more hurtful.


AUSTRALIA
The significance of a phone call to Taiwan
IT IS NOT LIKELY
that a Government
parliamentarian has
previously telephoned
Taiwan in order to try
to save his neck. But
one Liberal MP did this
last week. He is a keen
Gorton man, whose seat
is one of several being
examined by the DLP
as a possible con-
stituency in which
preferences could be
redistributed. He was
telephoning Taiwan to
appeal to DLP Sena-
tor McManus, who was
on a trip there, to put
in a word for him.
His panic came after
DLP Senate Leader
Gair had a half-hour’s
talk with the Prime
Minister last week and
told him that unless it
got satisfaction on defence and foreign
policy the DLP would feel forced to
carry through a strategy of reducing
the Government majority by redirect-
ing preferences in a number of elec-
torates. “From your performance so
far, we just don’t know where you
are going,” Senator Gair told Mr.
Gorton. “And we cannot possibly give
you a blank cheque.”
Since the Prime Minister said nothing
which indicated that he could satisfy
the DLP, its leaders are now planning
how to give selective advice to DLP
voters. They haven’t got down to great
detail yet, because some Labor candi-
dates haven’t been selected, and they
will be supporting only Labor moder-
ates, but the worried Liberal was sure
the DLP had it in for him, especially
as he is one of Mr. Gorton’s principal
apologists. On Wednesday, he made
several hundred-yard walks from his
office in the extreme east of the Parlia-
ment building, across Kings Hall, to the
DLP office in the far west. When he
tried to tell Senator Gair why an early
election was needed, he was interrupted
with the assertion: “You just want to
get into the Ministry, but don’t forget
under this system you have to be in
Parliament to be in the Ministry.”
At least another dozen Liberals last
week realised their danger from a DLP
redirection of preferences, and several
of them sought interviews with the
Prime Minister to dissuade him from
an early election. Machine men in the
Liberal organisation also weighed in.
Mr. Gorton, 'meanwhile, was seeking
advice on the extent to which the DLP
could manage to shift its preferences.
Many Liberals believe that DLP voters
are mostly Liberals really, and that the
DLP leadership would be unable to
DLP Leader Senator Gair (I.) and Senator McManus } who was in
Taiwan last week
get its supporters to move. At one
stage last week, Mr. Gorton expressed
the view that the Government would
be able to get at least half the DLP
preferences even where the leadership
had attempted to shift them Labor’s
way. But this may be wishful thinking.
In its base areas the DLP is very
highly organised and disciplined. This
applies to the whole of Victoria, much
of Queensland, and parts of Sydney.
In these places it would not surprise
observers if the DLP were able to switch
up to 75 percent of its preferences. With
the DLP regularly polling between ten
and 20 percent of the total vote in some
seats and perhaps more this year
a switch by three-quarters of its sup-
porters could determine the result in
those seats without difficulty.
Moreover, the whole DLP anti-ALP
propaganda apparatus —much smoother
and more powerful than anything the
Government can construct is of
considerable importance to the Govern-
ment. For the past few months this
DLP propaganda has been more anti-
Government than anti-ALP, preparing
its supporters for a selective switch of
preferences. Mr. Santamaria’s weekly
television commentaries, with a
following of some 500,000, have rein-
forced this.
The DLP’s problem may well
be the other way around: of keeping
preferences to the Government in seats
the DLP would prefer it to keep.
One of the obvious stratagems of
the Government is to try to undermine
the DLP leadership by adopting some
of its demands as Government policy.
Thus there is considerable significance
in Mr. Fairhall’s statement of “interest”
in developing nuclear technology “to
provide ever-increasing
quantities of power at
decreasing cost as well
as the fissionable mater-
ial on which the future
security of this country
might well depend.” lie
is vigorously opposing
Australian signature of
the Nuclear Non-Pro-
liferation Treaty and he
will probably succeed in
at least deferring a
decision until after an
election, so that the
DLP can be told that
the nuclear option is
still open.
At the same time,
Mr. Fairhall and Mr.
Hasluck are still doing
their best to make it
difficult for Mr. Gorton
to abandon a forward
posture in South-East
Asia. In a speech on the
defence estimates last week, Mr. Fair-
hall announced new commitments of
Australian Air Force units to Malaysia
and made statements which sound as
though there were no possibility of any
basic change in the disposition of Aus-
tralia’s forces. “At this time we are con-
sidering what might be done by way of
a joint Anzac contribution to the
future stability and defence of South-
East Asia . . .” Speaking of the
defence review, he said: “Although
much detailed planning must necessarily
await a study of strategic likelihoods
in the South-East Asian area in the
future, its outlines are reasonably pre-
dictable.”
But it is Mr. Gorton the DLP wants
to hear from, not Mr. Fairhall.
AUSTRALIAN OIL
PRIME MINISTER'S BABY
THE NEW low - price - oil policy
announced last week was very much
Mr. Gorton’s baby. And he was
very proud of his handling of it.
Following his delivery of it in the
House of Representatives, he gave two
briefings for the Press, which lasted
upwards of an hour altogether. At
these the Prime Minister delighted in
demonstrating his detailed grasp of
the technicalities of the oil business.
The jargon and figures rolled from
his lips like pleasantries.
But something like nine months’
backroom discussion lay behind his
expertness. Government decision about
what to do once the huge Bass Strait
field comes on stream in the middle of
next year has been long delayed. An


interdepartmental com,mittee of senior
officials from the Treasury, Trade,
Customs, and National Development
Departments was established in January
to devise a policy to cope with the
sudden flood of Australian oil about to
burst out of the Esso-BHP field. The
very high enforced prices and incentive
subsidies being granted for Moonie
and Barrow oil could not possibly
have been sustained once Australian
production became more than mar-
ginal. They could have raised the
price of petroleum products by as
much as 25 percent. As soon as the
hugeness of the Bass Strait reserves
had become apparent the question for
the Government has simply been of
how much the support prices would
be reduced and when.
The when of the matter was greatly
complicated by statements by Mr.
McEwen and National Development
Minister Fairbairn, to the effect that
the September, 1965, arrangements
were unalterable before they legally
expired in September, 1970. The
difficulty was that Bass Strait was
Gorton...detailed grasp of tech-
nicalities
coming on stream 15 months before
this. The interdepartmental commit-
tee of officials argued that the original
commitment for the five years from
September, 1970, was clearly based on
idigenous production being quite
marginal. They also pointed out that
the Bass Strait fields were extra-
ordinarily low-cost fields and there was
no question of their needing any
protection from imports.
As early as May and June they
were reco,mmending a policy much
along the lines of that adopted by
Mr. Gorton last week. But they got
hung up on the opposition of Mr.
Fairbairn and Mr. McEwen, who, as
high-cost protectionists, stonewalled
for months.
There was a failure of communica-
tion between the committee and the
Cabinet because of this and also be-
cause of two other facts. One was that
the Prime Minister had no representa-
tive on the committee since Mr. Hewitt,
his departmental secretary, in the rush
of taking up his new job, had neglected
to get his Department represented. The
second factor was the consequent isola-
tion of the only low-coster in the
Cabinet, the Treasurer.
After direct representations from oil-
industry leaders, Mr. Gorton took up
the issue himself to break the dead-
lock. They pointed out to him that
the Government would simply have to
make up its mind or they couldn’t
make the physical arrangements to
handle the Bass Strait oil in June,
1969. Complex shipping arrangements
had to be made, refineries to be modi-
fied, new intercompany swopping deals
negotiated.
Mr. Gorton quite quickly realised
that a high-price policy as being advo-
cated by Mr. Fairbairn and Mr.
McEwen (and of course by Esso-
BHP) would be politically troublesome
as well as economically damaging. He
knew that the DLP meant what it said
in its statement that it would use its
balance of power in the Senate to block
any Government arrangement which
would result in higher prices for oil
products. DLP Leader Senator Gair,
who battled the oil companies over
petrol prices when he was Premier of
Queensland ten years ago, would have
mobilised his four-man team against
the Government with great relish.
The interdepartmental committee on
oil policy came to one particularly
startling conclusion which probably
dealt a weighty blow against the high
prices. That was that the existing price
would probably lose Australia all
the potential gain in foreign exchange
of the Australian oil finds. At this price,
the profits to Esso-BHP would be
so enormous that profit remittances to
Standard Oil in America by Esso-
would actually exceed the savings on
imported oil, which the Bass Strait
field allowed. The interdepartmental
committee estimated that the partner-
ship would be clearing between
$600,000 and $BOO,OOO a day. And, of
course, paying no tax into the bargain
as long as it could go on finding new
fields.
The Prime Minister had advice that
the scheme he has adopted will allow
Esso-BHP to reap at least $250,000
straight profit each day. And the Gov-
ernment is advised that Esso-BHP
has grossly understated its oil reserves
by applying “ultra-conservative” esti-
mating techniques. With the companies
striking new oil with almost every drill-
ing, there are many people in Canberra
who are convinced that the Esso-BHP
lease alone holds enough oil to satisfy
all of Australia’s needs.
TARIFF REPORT
ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE?
WHEN THE Tariff Board’s con-
troversial annual report was tabled in
Parliament last week, Prime Minister
Gorton steered a cool middle path
between the contending camps. It was
all options-left-open again, and for the
time being the Prime Minister is keep-
ing the community guessing about his
tariff policy, as with so many other
matters. He said very firmly that the
Tariff Board’s role was advisory and
that the Government retained the right
to make tariff policy. But he wouldn’t
go on to define that policy, except in
familiar and rather meaningless
generalities.
But there were hints of approval
in both directions. The Tariff Board
was given the nod in its new procedures
which in essence are an attempt to
look at the implications, for other
industries, of an award of tariff protec-
tion for any one of them. Mr. Gorton
put clearly on record the Government’s
recognition of the value to the economy
of looking at effective rather than
merely nominal tariff rates. That, of
course, is not a matter of important
dispute between protectionists and
liberals, but it happens that improve-
ment in statistical techniques is of
more value to the liberal reformers
than it is to traditional blanket-
protectionists.
The Board can take heart, too, in
the Prime Minister’s statement that it
is free to follow what procedures it
thinks appropriate, that the Board
should re-examine its work methods,
and that it is expected to take all
possible steps to improve the quality of
its advice. *
But that was about the limit of
the Prime Minister’s support for the
Board. He also nodded in the direction
of the protectionist lobby, which has
been running a noisy campaign against
proposals for rationalisation of the
tariff. Most of these were negative, by
way of refusing some of the changes
the Board wanted.
Last year, in its annual report, it
asked the Government to instruct it
to re-examine all of Section 84 of the
Tariff Schedule, which deals with
machinery production. This section,
which has implications of extremely
high tariff protection hasn’t been
examined since the 19305. But the
Government did not refer the whole
section, but only bits of it. This year
the Board has asked again for Section
84 to be reviewed as a whole, along
with a review of another large area
of high protection, metals. For a
variety of reasons the Board thinks these
industries, whose production comes to
$l5OO million annually, deserve top-
priority in its proposed general review.
Mr. Gorton didn’t quite reject the
requests out of hand, but he com-
mented coldly on them, in a master-
piece of perishable prose: “Requests
from the Board for references designed
to facilitate public inquiries into areas
of the tariff which the Board considers
to be in need of review will, of course,
be considered in accordance with
normal procedures for determining
references to the Board.”
This is a nonsense statement, since
there is no such thing as “normal
procedures for determining references.”
References have come from the


Department of Customs, from the
Department of Trade, and from the
Government itself after ministerial
consideration of the problems of an
industry.
But it will be taken by the Board
as diplomatically expressed discourage-
ment, and an indication from the
Prime Minister that general super-
vision of tariff references will continue
in the hands of the ultra-protectionist
Department of Trade. However, Tariff
Board members looking for encourage-
ment are pointing to the fact that at
least the Government’s tabling of the
annual report was this year done by
the Prime Minister and not the
Minister for Trade. When he was Prime
Minister, Mr. Holt weakly left tariff
matters almost entirely to Mr. McEwen,
but this year Mr. Gorton is taking over.
His statement in Parliament was
Tariff Board chair-
man Rattigan (top
left) and Board
members Tucker
(above) and Murray
drafted in his own Department, not in
the Trade Department as usual, and
this is seen as significant.
The heat of controversy surrounding
tariff reform has drawn a good deal of
attention away from what the Board
is actually doing (a not entirely
unintended result of course), but this
year’s annual report is a most
sophisticated document, and a tribute
to chairman Alf Rattigan’s powers of
leadership. Three years ago, his Board
was deeply divided on the direction it
should take in sharpening its proce-
dures; but now, despite the different
interest groups its members are chosen
from farming, commerce, govern-
ment, and manufacturing it has been
able, to achieve a remarkable degree
of unanimity.
The key to the report is the outlining
by the Tariff Board of the framework
of principles within which it will in
future recommend protection. For new
ventures it “would usually regard
(processes) with low protective require-
ments that is, 25 percent or less in
effective rate terms, as worthy of
encouragement.” However it would be
“unlikely to recommend effective pro-
tection of more than 50 percent on
other than a short-term basis for any
new venture.”
This is a warning to manufacturers
that in future the Board will recom-
mend tariffs for only relatively compe-
titive lines of production. In itself this
will have a beneficial effect on how
Australia allots its resources, ensuring
that scarce capital is not squandered
on establishing unpaying industries. It
should reduce the amount of “undevel-
opment” in the private sector. At the
same time it will help keep costs in
check, exerting a general influence
toward higher productivity in the
economic and a more internationally
competitive spirit in the manufacturing
industries.
The Government’s problem will not
come with this aspect of the Board’s
policy but in the attitude toward exist-
ing industry, and it is here that the
lobby groups have already focused their
attack. In Canberra, the Chamber of
Manufactures was moved to issue a
second Press statement following for
them a rather mild initial rebuke by
the president, Mr. Pettingell. He had
/spoken of the “mixed feelings of
industry.” But the hardliner inside the
organisation, Mr. R. Anderson, tough-
ened the Chamber’s position with a
Press release the next day which became
almost lyrical in its protest: “Industry
has been left to ponder its future pros-
pects. For some, the prospects are
clouded, possibly dismal.”
These Chamber spokesmen were com-
plaining about the passage in the
Board’s report which said that “in
areas of production which are found to
have little prospect of operating with
an effective tariff rate of less than 50
percent, the Board would not recom-
mend protection sufficient to allow the
industries concerned to compete for
resources on the same basis as low-cost
industries.” It wouldn’t run them out
of business by not giving them any
protection, but it would, in other words,
make a profitable life very difficult
indeed by granting less tariff pro-
tection than they would need for really
good profitability. The thought in the
minds of Board members is that the
tariff would be designed to prevent
inefficient industries generating the sort
of cash flow profits which make
expansion easy.
If something is to be done about
this, the question that the Tariff Board
and the Government must face some
time soon is how they can ease the
transfer of resources from inefficient
industries to which they give the slow
squeeze. In North America and Western
Europe “adjustment assistance”
(usually in the form of low-interest
loans) is an accepted device for helping
high-cost producers to shift into new
and economic lines of production. It
will have to be adopted here eventually
and the Tariff Board itself will probably
raise the issue if the Government
doesn’t. In that case the Chamber of
Manufactures will have nothing what-
ever to moan about.
VICTORIA'S DOSSIERS
BUT WHY SO MANY?
PEOPLE OF Victoria’s Left estab-
lishment often joke sourly about being
on the files of ASIO and the Victorian
Police Special Branch, but they have
had the small consolation of thinking
they were among the elite of the
politically conscious. This may not be
so. If an article in the “Age” last
week by an experienced police reporter
was accurate, they share the distinction
with nearly a quarter million other
Victorians. If true this is, to say the
least, surprising.
The article was prompted by the
admission of the chief of the Victorian
CIB, Superintendent Bent, that his
Special Branch did keep files on
“agitators” and the politically suspect
people who had not committed any
crime. The Superintendent made the
statement after Mr. Don Dunstan’s com-
plaint to a Melbourne session of the
International Commission of Jurists
- that, from his experience as South
Australian Attorney-General, he knew
that police officers “will report to the
Minister on the private habits of people
from files, where there has been no
breach of the law.”
If the bulk of the work of the Vic-
torian Special Branch is political, as
the newspaper article claimed, it is
extremely difficult to reconcile the
number of purported files with the
supposed motives for keeping them.
The Chief Secretary, Sir Arthur
Rylah, has said on several occasions
that the Special Branch keeps dossiers
on individuals considered to have
subversive tendencies, and the Superin-
tendent said that all the Special Branch
needed for the opening of a new file
was for someone to make a statement
that created notoriety.
Although there is a great disparity
between the numbers of people who
might be thought to be subversive and
the numbers of people who make
notorious statements, the Superinten-
dent seemed to imply that notoriety
meant the utterance of some sort of
threat; the sort of threat a political
agitator might make. Taking into con-
sideration the friends and associates of
these agitators, it is still puzzling that
so many of Melbourne’s population
need to be watched.
Sir Arthur said in Parliament that
the Chief Commissioner of Police had
discretion to open new files on people
without convictions, but again the
“reputed thieves, associates of criminals,
missing persons, and so on” which Sir
Arthur mentioned couldn’t amount to
one-eighth of Melbourne’s population.
Later, Superintendent Bent refused tQ


elaborate on the procedures of the
Special Branch. He referred questions
to the Chief Secretary, who was asked
in the State Parliament this week if the
newspaper article was true.
The man who framed the question,
Clyde Holding, the State Opposition
leader, guessed that it would be possible
for tens of thousands of people to
have come into contact with “subver-
sives” and “agitators.” If he is right, the
Special Branch has been more efficient
than Kafka could have dreamed of.
One small sideline to the matter is
the amount of time the Victorian
Special Branch must have spent investi-
gating “People for Violence,” the now
defunct organisation at Melbourne
University that was later called
“Treason,” and then by a strange meta-
morphosis became “Reason.” In its
brief heyday of insanity “People for
Violence” publicly threatened to hang
the Vice-Chancellor, burn down the
University, and, in short, blow every-
thing up except Chairman Mao. Per-
haps not very funny, but then, perhaps,
not very dangerous.
NEW SOUTH WALES
ENDING(?) PROSTITUTION
THE UPPER HOUSE of the N.S.W.
Parliament came into its own last week
when it pushed through Chief Secretary
Eric Willis’ Prostitution Bill (i.e.,
amendments to the Vagrancy Act,
Disorderly Houses Act, Crimes Act).
Debate in the Lower House over
several days had ranged from Sparta
to Hamburg, and included discourses
on the relation of sin to crime and
reports from numerous MLAs of their
experiences when they conscientiously
inspected Chapel Street, Sydney’s red-
light district. The Upper House was
more to the point. It dealt with the
Bill in one sitting and either because
there are women in that House or
because it is an undemocratic assembly
with no responsibility to the outside
constituencies, a sort of humor was
allowed to enter an otherwise owlishly
solemn debate as Honorable Members
accused each other of extraordinary
depths of knowledge of the subject.
The Bill is now law and in essence
it: (1) makes possible police action
against the system of one-prostitute
brothels, which are the basis of the
Chapel Street trade and which, until
now, could not be touched. (They were
not disorderly houses they had only
one prostitute in each of them; the
prostitutes were not in a public place
they sat in private doorways; and
they did not solicit they waited for
a customer to approach them. Now it
will be an offence for them to loiter
“in view of” a public place for the
purposes of prostitution penalty up
to $2OO or 6 months’ prison or both.)
(2) Increases penalties on pimps and
bludgers (up to $4OO or up to 5 years’
prison or both); and on the landlords
of brothels, including those dressed up
as massage parlors (up to $4OO or up
Sydney’s Chapel St ....$200 or six
months
to 6 months’ prison or both.) (3)
Penalises a prostitute found in a known
or reasonably suspected brothel, a term
which includes cars (up to $4OO or up
to 6 months’ prison or both).
The Bill should mean the end of
Chapel Street (and similar streets in
N.S.W. provincial cities), and if the
prostitutes move out into ordinary
streets or into mobile brothels (i.e., cars,
or trucks, or for that matter, yachts)
they will face higher penalties. No one
believes that the new Act will eliminate
prostitution, but it seems certain to
remove some of the public scandal
associated with the trade and it will
make life harder for most of Sydney’s
500 prostitutes and their hangers-on.
The risk is that the new high penalties
will increase the temptation to corrup-
tion in (as some solicitors like to put it)
New South Wales’ otherwise incorrup-
tible police force.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
NO ELASTIC FRANCHISE
THERE WERE two separate moves in
the South Australian Parliament last
week to extend the Upper House
franchise. As it stands, the Legislative
Council is elected on general head-of-
family lines by property owners,
occupiers of dwelling houses, and some
returned servicemen. It is not com-
pulsory for eligible persons to either
enrol or vote for the Council, and with
five four-member districts, three of
which are in the country, an LCL
majority of up to 16 has been a
permanent feature of South Australian
political life.
Considered by many LCL members
as the ultimate deterrent to possible
ALP excesses, the Legislative Council
has served the LCL well. However,
following widespread public criticism
of the State’s electoral system earlier
this year, Premier Hall, supported by
Attorney-General Millhouse, moved in
the LCL annual conference for a full
adult franchise. The move was defeated,
but it seems clear that the present
measure introduced in the Council by
the former Attorney-General of the
Playford Government, Mr. Rowe, is
a move by the old guard designed to
forestall the more radical changes
favored by the Premier.
In effect, Mr. Rowe’s Bill would not
change the pattern of voting that has
established itself over the years. The
Bill would give the vote to spouses of
present voters who have attained the
age of 21 and who are about to vote
for the Lower House, no longer require
the value of the voter’s real property to
be at least $lOO, and enlarge the rights
of servicemen and ex-servicemen.
With its permanent LCL majority,
almost unlimited power to alter Bills,
and tortuous deadlock provisions, the
Council has always been a legislative
thorn in the ALP’s governmental flesh.
Debating the Lower House Electoral
Redistribution Bill last week, the
ALP Member for Semaphore, Mr.
Hurst, expressed his Party’s attitude to
the Council when he growled that
“electoral justice would not be achieved
until the Legislative Council electoral
system was changed, and people could
elect the Parliament they wanted.”
Anticipating Mr. Rowe’s Bill,
Opposition Leader Dunstan the same
day gave notice of a Bill to amend the
Constitution Act, which would simply
provide full adult franchise for the
Council. It was a tactical move to
open up the whole issue once more and
to force the Government into a defen-
sive position. He said, no doubt with
the Premier and Attorney-General in
mind, that his Bill would “give the
opportunity for those LCL members
who say they are free from Party
influence, and who have supported
adult franchise for the Council, to-
stand up and be counted.”
THE TERRITORIES/1
LOBBYING ARCHITECTS
“ARE WE SO thin-skinned that we
resent criticism of the way in which we
discuss matters from time to time? I
do not think we are so guilty that we
should take umbrage at criticism that
may be offered.” The speaker was
South Australian Labor Senator J. L.
Cavanagh, the scene the red-lined
Senate Chamber of Federal Parliament,
the subject a letter from J. H. McCon-
nell, Federal president of the Royal
Australian Institute of Architects, sent
to all Members of Parliament.
The letter, which Members received
last week, is the first shot in a lobbying
campaign aimed at ensuring a vote for
the Lake Burley Griffin site for a new
Parliament House. The other choice,
on Capital Hill, is denounced in the
letter as being unrelated to planning
and development of the parliamentary
triangle over the past ten years.
The architects or at least 22 of
the Institute’s members entered the
lobbying field after a meeting in a

Canberra motel. As well as the letter,
they decided to send a flood of tele-
grams to Parliament when the debate
on the site, deferred for more than a
month, resumes in the House of Repre-
sentatives this week.
It would, of course, be grossly unfair
to suggest the meeting, which voted in
favor of the lake site, was “stacked”
beforehand, though some observers were
initially convinced this was the case.
Even though Mr. McConnell a
declared supporter of the lake called
the meeting initially as a “protest”
against the evinced desire of most MPs
for the hill, even though Mr.
McConnell handpicked the 22 archi-
tects who attended the meeting “For
what I thought they could contribute
to the discussion,” and even though all
22 voted without dissent against Capital
Hill, any such suggestions would be
completely unfounded.
Mr. McConnell put paid to these
rumors after one journalist ungallantly
suggested the 22 architects at the
meeting might just possibly not repre-
sent the Institute’s 4000 members. “I
think one pressman thinks I have
cooked this meeting,” Mr. McConnell
told the gathering. “That is not true,
because I have not spoken to any of
you.” Immediately two of the 22
jumped to their feet to join Mr. Mc-
Connell in refuting the scurrilous
suggestion.
The decision to begin lobbying came
after a bus tour of the alternate sites
(even the bus driver was an ardent
lake man). Seven minutes were spent
wandering over Capital Hill, but at the
lake the architects greeted an invitation
to leave the bus to inspect the site more
closely with a resounding “No.” It
seemed a forgone conclusion.
When the symposium began, the six
architects who spoke were unanimous
it had to be the lake. But the site
did not seem to be their main concern.
All speakers agreed that they were
affronted by the Parliament’s reluctance
to accept professional advice. The
debate had been carried on in a
“lunatic” atmosphere . . . Politicians
were “irresponsible” . . . “Why should
the decision be the prerogative of
Parliament?” “They should rely on
professional advice.”
Professional advice had to be
accepted or the whole question thrown
into a “ridiculous melting pot.” The
architects were incensed that the
question was being discussed “in the
traditional vacuum of Parliamentary
debate.”
The Senate, which has already made
its decision (in favor of the hill) well
known, was roused most by the
proceedings. Senate President Sir
Alister McMullin was asked by Labor’s
Jim Keeffe to investigate whether the
letter constituted contempt of Parlia-
ment. Later, on the adjournment,
Senators joined to denounce the
architects’ action.
The letter has so far aroused little
concern in the House of Representatives,
though the Member for the A.C.T.,
Jim Fraser, a devoted lake man,
described it as “valueless” as a piece of
evidence, and a “very poor effort in
public relations. As I see it, the fair
city of Canberra is marred and blotted
already by the mistakes of architects,”
he said on his weekly radio program.
“The title ‘architect’ holds no magic
for me. The Institute might have had
the grace to stay out of the argument.”
The DLP’s Senator Condon Byrne
probably summed up the politicians’
attitude best. “If this protest had come
in the form of a letter over a name
which had some great significance, such
as Gropius, Le Corbusier, or Frank
Lloyd Wright, it might have attracted a
great deal of attention. But we do not
know the gentleman concerned.” And,
suggesting Parliament best ignore the
architects’ protests, he went on, “Let
their conduct be its own condemna-
tion.”

THE TERRITORIES/2
APPEALING CANDIDATES
AT HIGH NOON on Friday, Septem-
ber 27, Mr. Ross McPherson, the
electoral officer for the Northern
Territory, came out of his office, stood
on the pavement, and addressed a small
crowd of hopefuls. “I have received,”
he began, “a writ from His Honor
the Administrator commanding me to
hold an election for the Northern
Territory Legislative Council on
October 26.” He then went on to read
out the list of 38 candidates for the 11
Elected seats.
So began a campaign of four weeks
and a day that is, in its way, unique
in the history of Australian elections.
It is the first time that any Aboriginal
full-blood person has contested an
election. It is also the first time that
all three national Parties have con-
tested elections in this hot, dusty piece
of Commonwealth real estate on the
top of Australia.
The candidates have already moved
into position and the big guns of the
national Parties are aiming at each
other in an eyeball-to-eyeball contest.
National Party policies for the north
have been dusted and displayed by the
Party candidates and on the fringe the
Independents and Aboriginal candidates
are appealing to voters on local and
ethnic issues.
Winunguj (pronounced Winivitch),
the Aboriginal candidate, is a 50-year-
old carpenter, a sixth-grade student,
and a well-liked and respected member
of the Goulburn Island Methodist
mission station. Supporting him on an
Aboriginal advancement issue is Mrs.
J. Clague, a part-Aboriginal woman
from New South Wales, a candidate for
Stuart in the south of the Territory.
The two of them are being endorsed
by the Northern Territory Council for
Aboriginal Rights, an organisation that
has been mainly concerned with
Aboriginal strikes and walk-offs up to
now.
Mr. Winunguj is being opposed by
Liberal and Country Party candidates
in the electorate of Arnhem 34,000
square miles of Aboriginal Reserve
land, one small cattle station, and some
Crown Land. Most of the voters are
Aborigines, near enough to two-thirds
of everyone on the Electoral Roll.
Mrs. Clague, on the other hand, is
wholly Europeanised. She has a Euro-
pean husband and is, in Aboriginal
terminology, a “yellow fella,” a member
of an ethnic group which has no real
connection with full-blood Aborigines
in the Territory. She is also a woman,
a disadvantage in the eyes of the
Aborigine, male and female alike. Mrs.
Clague’s electorate is, like Arnhem,
two-third Aboriginal voters.
Rounding out a trio of pro-
Aboriginal candidates is Stan Smith, a
, European and an executive member
of the Federal Council for the Advance-
ment of Aborigines and Torres Strait
Islanders. He is the Labor Party can-
didate for Victoria River, an electorate
with 25 percent Aboriginal voters.
This electorate also includes Wattie
Creek, the squatting place of the
Gurindjis.
The line-up of Party candidates is
headed by the Country Party with a
man for every seat. Following them is
the Labor Party with nine candidates,
then the Liberals with six, mainly in
the urban seats of Darwin and Alice
Springs. Twelve Independents add a
touch of levity to the hustings. One
of them wants an underground railway
for Darwin, not in 1980 but now.
Another, an airman, is in a unique
position for electioneering. His elec-
torate includes the large RAAF base,
whose commander announced that can-
didates would not be allowed inside
to talk to service voters.
Some of the Independents are former
elected members with very good
chances of being elected. The mayor
of Darwin and President of the last
Legislative Council, Harry Chan, is
tipped for re-election, and “Tiger”
Brennan, a long-time member of the
Council, is also considered to have a
pretty good chance. The main value
of the other ten is in splitting the vote
and in the allocation of preferences.

INTERNATIONAL
The alarm
of three
neutrals
President Kekkonen of Finland...
in for the Russian treatment?
Austria’s Franz Jonas...
an alert to the Army
Yugoslavia’s Tito...forecasting a
return to the cold war
FIVE WEEKS ago an Austrian in the
Vienna Flying Club drove to Schwechat
Airport to take his weekend lessons. He
found the light-aircraft runway closed.
Puzzled and nosy, he wandered into
the underbrush at the runway limits
and found himself looking at the anti-
aircraft guns and light armor of
the Austrian Army. In a move still
neither fully admitted nor fully
explained, the Austrians took a tip-off
seriously enough to fortify the airports
that day against Soviet troop aircraft.
Last week Russian Prime Minister
Kosygin visited Finland unexpectedly.
President Kekkonen, who invited him,
experienced an urgent need to hear
Mr. Kosygin repeat certain well-worn
phrases from the Soviet - Finnish
Friendship Treaty of 1948, which the
two statesmen confirmed “remains
the solid foundation for the develop-
ment of Soviet-Finnish relations.” In
recent local elections, the Finnish
Communists did strikingly badly, while
rumors went round Helsinki that the
Russians were demanding permission
to station “observers” in certain West
Finnish ports and on the Finnish-
Swedish borders.
The Yugoslavs continue to prepare
for the worst. Partisan training is being
reintroduced for the forces; in Britain,
Mr. Milovan Djilas, Tito’s former
friend, warns that a struggle against
Soviet invasion could be even fiercer
than the struggle against the Germans.
Other Yugoslavs abroad speak hope-
fully of old declarations by Western
statesmen that an attack on Yugoslavia
would be a casus belli and insist that
such an attack would lead to general
war.
1 aking leave of President Jonas of
Austria last week. Marshal Tito fore-
cast a return to the cold war and added
angrily: “Our goodwill alone cannot
stave off such a development, which
depends on great powers which see only
their own interests and pay no heed to
small countries.”
The alarm of these three neutral
Europeans after the Soviet occupation
of Czechoslovakia is an ominous con-
sequence of that Black Wednesday in
August. They do not now feel that
they are about to be physically attacked,
although in the long run none of them
can exclude the possibility.
But their great shudder of alarm is
a diplomatic fact in itself. For these
small States round the periphery of the
Soviet alliance, neutrality offers little
protection. They want to know what
the Soviet Union thinks of them in its
new mood. They want to know who
might help them in the hour of crisis.
In all three, Soviet foreign policy has
a stake, formal or ideological. Finland
and Austria rank as defeated enemy
States. Finland almost became a
people’s republic in 1948, but managed
to escape with sharply limited inde-
pendence, a temporary Soviet military
presence, and an unstated Soviet influ-
ence over internal politics.
Austria regained independence by the
State Treaty of 1955, securing four-
power withdrawal by a Note to the
powers assuring “perpetual neutrality”
and the prohibition of “foreign military
bases” on Austrian territory. Yugo-
slavia broke with the Soviet bloc in
1948: here Soviet interest rests on no
rights, but on what “Pravda” so deli-
cately calls “the laws of class struggle,”
which override “formal legalistic con-
siderations.” The new Soviet claim is
that Moscow’s estimate of what is good
for Socialism justifies violation of
international law.
In the past, all these three States
looked forward to an end of the
cold war. Today, they are struck by
an appalling doubt. Could Czecho-
slovakia have happened if there had
been no detente? In the cold war,
Soviet and American forays along the
old iron curtain were prevented by
sheer uncertainty: neither could tell
what its adversary would do in
retaliation. But is this true today?
The Russian-American idea of
peaceful coexistence is bringing a
much sharper definition of spheres of
influence. This could be dangerous
for the neutrals. It could lead to a
situation in which the Soviet Union
felt safe to take any action in Finland
while knowing that a move into the
old Soviet zone of Austria would
detonate world war.
Of the three, Finland is by far the
most exposed. Since the revolution
the Soviet Union has always evinced
extraordinary nervousness of this
minute neighbor. Before Mr. Kosy-
gin’s visit, “Izvestia” warned of a
West German “ drang nach nordern ’
into Scandinavia, and complained of
“certain circles in Finland which have
not yet forgotten old pro-German
sympathies.” This is stage thunder,
but an effective reminder that Finland
has plenty of friends, but only one
Russia.
Austria came in for a round of
menaces, as the Soviet Press suggested
that by harboring “Czechoslovak
counter-revolutionary terrorists” the
Viennese Government might be break-
ing its renunciation of foreign military
bases. Here, however, the involvement
of three Western powers is a deterrent,
and Austrian neutrality remains a
useful .model for Soviet diplomats if
they return to offering Bonn reunifi-
cation in return for withdrawal from
NATO.
Yugoslavia has no direct protection:
neither Britain nor the United States
admits to any kind of formal commit-
ment to defend it. The West, however,
lets it be known that a Soviet presence


on the Adriatic would be taken by
NATO as a major alteration of the
whole strategic picture.
The Yugoslavs themselves ask for no
guarantees: they consider Soviet action
of some kind against Rumania probable
in the long run, but trust that Mr.
Brezhnev still values the status quo
enough to avoid moving against
Yugoslavia.
Nothing at present suggests that the
Soviet leaders contemplate using force
against any of these three countries.
But the bad nerves, the irresolution
of this group of mutually suspicious
men are a danger in themselves. If
the generals pressed for a firmer grip
on Finland or even a swift blow at
the Yugoslav heresy, the decision
would be taken less on grounds of
commonsense than as the result of an
unpredictable chain-reaction of per-
sonalities. The Presidiujn and Central
Committee are like Europe in 1914,
and any sudden crisis could prove a
Sarajevo.
No doubt it’s safer for the human
race that Russians and Americans
should know precisely how far each
can go. If the Yugoslavs and the Finns
thought that it would present them
with an American guarantee, they
might favor “precision,” too. But they
fear the opposite: a frank statement
that America wouldn’t fight for either.
Both, and Austria, believe in the
detente, the sort of detente which gives
small nations the right to live inde-
pendently. But now when, after
Czechoslovakia, they look at the two
super-powers, they are reminded of
how little Poland served to keep the
peace between the three 19th-century
empires. The monarchy had a detente.
They defined their mutual spheres of
interest. They carved up Poland
between them.
U.S. PRESIDENCY
"US-AGAINST-THEM"
“WHAT THIS COUNTRY needs,”
said the man from Pensacola, Florida,
“is a good five-cent cigar and George
Wallace for President.” Public opinion
surveys suggest that at least a fifth of
the entire American electorate feels the
same way about the former Governor
of Alabama who is running as the
candidate of the American Independent
Party. To the dismay of both major
political Parties, Mr. Wallace’s follow-
ing has almost doubled in the course
of a few months of campaigning.
His hold on the four Deep Southern
States which might otherwise have gone
Republican Alabama, Georgia,
Louisiana, Mississippi is firm and he
has possibilities of victory in a dozen
others reaching up into the border
areas of Kentucky, Maryland, and
Oklahoma. In the North it is the
Democrats who are the sufferers and
in such vital big States as Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.
In all these States Mr. Wallace is

paigning last

more of us than
there are of
them”

ravaging a once solid part of the Demo-
cratic coalition, the blue-collar workers.
If he is unlikely to win there him-
self, he seems at least to be destroying
the Democrat’s hopes of beating Mr.
Nixon.
While Mr. Wallace speeds the demo-
lition of the historic Democratic
monopoly in the South, he is delaying
another process that not so long ago
looked inevitable, the conversion of the
South to the Republican Party. Outside
the South, the white industrial workers
have had little choice but to vote for
the same Democratic establishment in
Washington that also gets the votes of
the black manual workers whom they
resent. But now Mr. Wallace has sud-
denly shown the white working class
an alternative. Thus it can be argued
that he is doing more than Senator
McCarthy and the late Senator Robert
Kennedy together did to undermine the
electoral coalition on which Democratic
power has rested for the past 40 years.
To see Mr. Wallace in action, as
opposed to reading about him in a
generally hostile Press, is to understand
that the constituency he has collected
up is as much a disparate coalition held
together by a few common interests as
is any other national Party in America.
However, the Wallace group still has
the fervor of the newly gathered
together, it is made up of the outs and
the ignored in an increasingly gigantic
political mass and it has the most com-
pelling and bitterly humorous candidate
in the ring to nourish its aspirations on
rhetoric.
But, as campaigning time runs out,
the urge grows in a country used to the
clear choice of a two-party system not
to throw away votes on a candidate who
cannot win a three-man race. Mr.
Wallace knows this. He often describes
the purpose of his campaign speeches
as being to “bring words of encourage-
ment” to his hearers. He describes
accurately the receptions he has had
from crowds round the country, usually
bigger than those that have turned out
for the two major candidates. “It is
your movement,” he says. “There are
more of us than there are of them . . .”
It is an exercise in promoting self-
respect, fostered by the uniquely sug-
gestive oratory of the candidate, so
often quoted and misquoted by the
dazed American Press. Mr. Wallace is
no racist fanatic, but a cool, shrewd
politician. But he used racism to gain
and keep power in Alabama and he
incites the fanaticism that is latent
among resentful outs hoping to get in.
Surveys of his following show that the
largest single common element among
his supporters is, to put it crudely, a
dislike of their Negro neighbors. But
it is also true that his largest following
is among the youngest group of voters.
It is not the ritual references to law
and order on the streets or to “law-
lessness” in the national capital which
draw the loudest cheers. The real
enthusiasm breaks out when Governor
Wallace lays into the “pseudo-
intellectuals,” the liberals, “the
anarchists” who have caused all the
harm. Recently, before a testing audi-
ence at the big university in Lexington,
Kentucky, he proclaimed himself in
favor of academic freedom and dissent.
But, he went on, when professors in
California call for a Viet Cong victory,
“I don’t call that academic free speech,
I call it pure treason. And when I am
President the first thing I’m going to
do, I’m going to ask my Attorney-
General to seek an indictment against
any professor . . .” The rest of the
sentence is lost in a screamed release of
tension among his hearers.
Tt is at this point that the Wallace
appeal and the Presidential program
that he hints at rather than proclaims
seem so threatening. It is a violent
version of the “us-against-them” appeal.
It is confirmed by his conscious identi-
fication with the police forces. His
usually misquoted threat to the students
who might lie down in front of his
Presidential car, the threat to drag
intellectuals from their offices by “their
long hair,” to throw the bureaucrats’
briefcases into the Potomac, the pro-
scribing of gun-control laws as “winding
up with every good person being with-
out guns while every thug in South
Carolina and Alabama . . these are
the menaces that so disturb those
Americans —the majority of the elec-
torate —who will not vote for Mr.
Wallace.
The ultimate Wallace promise is
to find “simple answers to simple
questions.” It is “saying so,me of the
things you want to hear, and what is
wrong with that?” This makes a fine
rallying cry. But it does not bear
close examination.
Mr. Wallace will not win, but he is
there for another time, 1972. His
“organisatio n,” like Senator
McCarthy’s, has a national force of


volunteers to draw on. At his head-
quarters in Montgomery, Alabama, are
stored huge lists of potential campaign
workers in every State.
The opinion surveys show plainly
that in America in 1968 it has become
respectable to declare oneself for Mr.
Wallace of Alabama. This is still
.something that the liberal establishment
cannot get used to. It persists in call-
ing Mr. Wallace a “phenomenon”
■when his candidacy is the most natural
reaction to the events of the past 15
years; it persists in thinking of his
following as ugly, racist, and isolated.
But, in fact, Mr. Wallace’s relative
.success shows how far the liberal
establishment, in forcing through
necessary changes in the country, has
itself become isolated from some sort
of its own old sources of support.
SABAH
SHAPING UP AGAIN
From HARVEY STOCKWIN
THE SABAH CLAIM dispute con-
tinues to get a great deal of attention
with no end in sight. But after the
noise, the relative quiet. Again there
is the prospect of a cooling-off period,
though whether it will be any more
successful than the last one remains in
doubt. It would seem more likely
that in the long run it will only lead
to another heating up.
The past few weeks have not lacked
evidence that President Marcos has
considered heating up the nationalist
aspects of the dispute on the Filipino
side to use them in his own electoral
interest. The central fact is that he
Las continued to blow both hot and
cold and has steadfastly refused to
commit himself to one line of action or
another. In fact it is quite a job for
observers to keep up with all the
policies, poses, and contradictions that
flow forth from Manila. On the one
hand there are the bellicose statements,
on the other there is the insistence that
a solution be found. All of this is the
only course from the point of view of
internal politics. From the viewpoint
of international relations, needless to
.say, it is somewhat less satisfactory.
Thus, no sooner had the President
upped the dispute by signing the
■“annexation” Bill than he was talking
about a summit conference with
Malaysia’s Tunku Abdul Rahman.
It all had the flavor of “Now I have
made things difficult let’s see if we can
untangle the mess.” To observers the
real motive seemed some posturing on
the international scene in order to
conceal the impasse.
Naturally, it was not difficult to hear
arguments in Kuala Lumpur that it was
no part of Malaysia’s Business to assist
Marcos’ re-election prospects or to go
racing toward the first proferred olive
branch when so many earlier ones had
proved illusory.
However, a Manila radio station
by some as yet unexplained fluke
managed to get the Tunku on the other
end of a telephone line, and the Malay-
sian Prime Minister, true as ever to his
generous and pacific instincts, conceded
a willingness to meet the President any-
where, anytime.
While it would have seemed more
sensible for such a commitment to
have been made later rather than
sooner, it was hedged with the qualifi-
cation that in no circumstances were the
Malaysians willing to talk on the sub-
ject of the rejected Sabah claim. At
first, Manila hedged upon this, but
eventually, after a great deal of to-ing
and fro-ing, the President conceded that
he was willing to talk without
preconditions.
Another Malaysian insistence that
preparatory talks should be held first
—was likewise agreed to after an equal,
or even greater, amount of to-ing and
fro-ing, largely due to the Filipino
preference for the columns of their
Press rather than the sustained and
systematic use of the diplomats they
have officially notified they are with-
drawing from Kuala Lumpur, but who
are still in town. Ultimately, Philippine
Foreign Secretary Narcisco Ramos, in
New York for the UN General
Assembly, saw the Malaysian UN
Ambassador. Through this route suf-
ficient assurance was relayed to make a
preliminary ministerial meeting
acceptable.
Consequently, a Press statement from
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Tun
Razak, issued on Sunday, announced
that he would be leaving for Tokyo
on or about October 22, there to meet
Ramos to discuss ways and means for
“the easing of tension” between the
two countries and to examine the possi-
bility of “a summit meeting.” The state-
ment went on to say that the message
received from Ramos indicated clearly
that “the question of the Philippine
claim to Sabah will not be a subject
for discussion,” and also that there is
a “clear intention on the part of the
Philippines to ease the present tension
and bring about reconciliation.”
Obviously, the Malaysian insistence
on non-discussion of the claim is
potentially meaningless, in that if
carried to its logical conclusion it would
mean that the talks would be unable to
discuss the reasons for present tensions.
What the Malaysians mean is that they
are not willing to reopen the talks
begun at Bangkok on the settlement of
the claim, and that their rejection
stands unamended and presumably
unamendable.
Equally, the Malaysians have by no
means an easy task of remaining firm
while not appearing unreasonable.
Obviously it would be an advantage
for them if well before, these forth-
coming talks the Filipinos were left in
absolutely no doubt how their SEATO,
ASPAC, and ASEAN allies regarded
their Sabah posturing. This, however,
would appear far too much to hope
for. Therefore, a substantial outcome
must be doubted.
At least in the past few weeks the
Indonesians have bestirred themselves,,
with Brigadier-General Ali Moertpop,,
whose silent and unseen comings and
goings played a considerable part in
ending Sukarno’s Confrontation of
Malaysia, similarly now making gener-
ally unseen visits to both Manila and
Kuala Lumpur. Unlike the Sukarno
Confrontation, the great lack, as no
doubt Moertpop discovered, is that the
Malaysians and Filipinos, unlike the
Malaysians and Indonesians, are not
on each others’ wavelengths given
the permanent Filipino political
amplifier. Indonesia’s leverage is
limited, but maybe this initiative
might have helped Marcos decide that
cold waters were worth exploring.
RHODESIA
THE FEARLESS TALKS
IN RETURNING HOME from the
inconclusive talks in Gibraltar with
Mr. Harold Wilson, Mr. lan Smith
faces a lonely future. South Africa and
Portugal, the countries which have
made it possible until now for him to
carry through the Rhodesian rebellion,
pushed him toward Gibraltar.
During devious negotiations in
August and September, there were

repeated hints to Salisbury that the
crucial help in evading sanctions might
come to a sudden end. One of Dr.
Salazar’s last acts before he subsided
into his long coma was to send Mr.
Smith a strongly worded message. It
urged him to make major concessions
so that a deal could be reached with
Britain.
In Pretoria, there has been scant
attempt to hide South Africa’s eager-
ness to break the Rhodesian impasse.
The key figure has been Dr. Hilgard
Muller, the Foreign Minister. He is
the architect of his country’s “co-
prosperity” theory for winning over
neighboring black States. Dr. Muller re-
gards Mr. Smith’s refusal to budge as
the greatest obstacle to his schemes.
Recently Dr. Muller visited Malawi for
highly successful talks with President
Banda.
In Dr. Muller’s view, with the
Rhodesian dispute out of the way, it
would even be possible to come to
terms with Zambia the greatest
prize. He has said of President Kaunda:
“It is high time he begins to realise
he is sounding a discordant note in
Southern Africa, where good neighbor-
liness is being practised.”
If such a bizarre detente were
achieved, it could lessen the guerilla
threat which increasingly worries South
Africa.
This strategy explains why the cool,
Oxford-educated Dr. Muller featured
so largely in setting up the Gibraltar
meeting on HMS Fearless. He had a
series of consultations with Mr. George
Thomson, the Commonwealth Secretary.
Two were in Pretoria, while Mr. Thom-
son was in Southern Africa for
Swaziland’s independence. Mr. John
Vorster, the South African Premier,
took part. The most recent talk was
the week before last, when Dr. Muller
was passing through London to the
United Nations.
Pressure on Mr. Smith has also
been applied by leading Afrikaner
businessmen with connections in
Rhodesia. These manoeuvres were part
of the softening up from South Africa
which preceded Mr. Smith’s meetings
in mid-August with Lord Goodman
and Sir Max Aitken. Lord Goodman,
on an unofficial reconnaissance for Mr.
Wilson, first went unobtrusively to
South Africa. He moved up to Salisbury
and, with Sir Max and Mr. Smith,
drew up a memorandum listing points
of agreement and disagreement. The
three signed it on every page.
But it seems likely that the British,
the South Africans, and the Portuguese
all failed to allow for the stubborn
nature of Rhodesia’s white leader. Mr.
Smith has repeatedly shown in the past
an extra truculence when told from
outside what he should do. Mr. Wilson
may also have fallen victim to the
confidence in South Africa that Mr.
Smith was ready to negotiate a com-
promise which formally embraced the
six principles Britain laid down as the
basis for a settlement.
It now appears that, in agreeing to
fly to Gibraltar, Mr. Smith was going
through the motions of seeking a solu-
tion, merely to gain time. The line-up
of forces was too great for him to refuse
outright.
Time could be his greatest asset in
neutralising the new South African atti-
tude. Mr. Vorster can expect an angry
reaction from some of his own
nationalist followers when it sinks in
that he has been turning the screws on
Rhodesia.
There is a growing awareness in the
African States that Dr. Muller and his
verligte (outward-looking) colleagues
in Pretoria would like to see the slow
emergence in Rhodesia of a “co-
operative” black government, proto-
types of which exist in Lesotho and
Malawi.
But leaders like Kaunda, Nyerere,
and Obote see this as part of a long-
term strategy of subversion from the
south. To that extent they are at one
with Mr. Smith, who is unwilling to
have his “principles” undermined
merely to provide South Africa with
an arc of buffer States.
SINGAPORE
LEE SWITCHES OFF
“IT’S JUST A private visit so I can
switch off all the valves,” said Singa-
pore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew
in a jocular mood as he departed on
what will be his first sabbatical leave
in a long while.
Lee goes first to Japan to return
Prime Minister Sato’s visit to Singa-
pore last year and to meet sojne of
Japan’s leading industrialists and
potential investors. From Japan he will
be heading to the University of British
Colombia in Vancouver for three
weeks before making a short official
visit to meet Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau, whom he has described as
“dynamic, vigorous, and forward
looking.” Then he will proceed to the
United States to stay for about a
month at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard, returning to
Singapore on or around December 15.
During his absence Finance Minister
Goh Keng Swee will be Acting Prime
Minister.
According to Lee, his university
sojourns will be for rest, reading, and
some writing, not to mention talks
and talking. While one may wonder
just how many of Lee’s valves will be
switched off in the calm of ivory
towers (and whether these will give
him the “ideas” about e,motional
rapport with his neighbors, which
would seem his greatest lack) and how
many will be switched on to the
American political scene, undoubtedly
Lee’s sabbatical is well deserved.
Not many Prime Ministers, after all,
can justifiably claim, “I have done
all the things that have to be done
at the moment . . . Meanwhile, let
somebody else warm the eggs up!”
nor assert that the situation in their
countries is “tranquil, national, and
generally optimistic.”

New Zealanders, who feel that the tour

after bitter argument between those
who said the All Blacks should stay
home rather than accept the ban South
Africa then put on Maori players, and
those who insisted there was no need
to bring politics into sport. The All
Blacks toured then without Maoris, but
had the same demand been made for
the next projected tour, in 1970,
hardening opinion against such an
affront to New Zealand’s proudly anti-
racist outlook could have prevented
another all-white tour.
Prime Minister Vorster’s recent rejec-
tion of colored cricketer Basil d’Oliveira
and the subsequent cancellation of the
MCC tour has refocused the attention
of New Zealanders on the implications
of their own sporting links with South
Africa. The Citizens All Blacks Tour
Association, which headed the protests
in 1960, was never disbanded, and
pressure has been growing in the radical
community for it to get on the job
again.
However, New Zealand opinion is
still strongly divided on the All Blacks
issue. The voluble opponents of
apartheid argue that racist policies
cannot be ignored in the name of sport,
while football fans and their spokesmen,
the sportswriters, insist that the tour
must go on.
The tour opponents question Prime
Minister Vorster’s undertaking to
accept non-white players, including
Maoris, provided they are chosen with-
out political motivation, and even look
hopefully at the difficulty of defining
‘’political motivation” as a fruitful way
of furthering their cause.
Another preoccupation of the
defenders of integrated sport is the
position of Maori team supporters in
South Africa. Can Maori spectators
accompany the team to South Africa
without being forced into segregation
indignities? And even if Maori spec-
tators were given the status of honorary
whites, objections to the tour would
remain. Maori MP Mat Rata says he
does not want his people made to
appear a cut above colored Africans.
He believes Maoris should join the
fight for racial integration everywhere.
However, others, though equally
antagonistic to apartheid, support the
tour merely because Maoris are allowed
to go this time; they see sport as a
way of keeping the doors open and the
pressure on.

THE WEEK IN AMERICA
M FOR MATURE
THE UNITED STATES is the last
major country in the world to adopt
a system of classifying tnotion pictures
on a moral basis. Under a new voting
system announced last week to answer
critics of the Hollywood industry who
object to increasing sex, nudity,
violence, and obscene language in films,
children under 16 will be prohibited
from seeing “unsuitable” films. How-
ever, unlike classification systems in
other countries, the American system
will be controlled by members of the
film industry and administered by
Hollywood without government parti-
cipation or authority.
The Production Code Administration,
made up of seven people appointed by
the Motion Picture Association of
America, will administer the rating
.system. Beginning November 1, all
films, domestic or imported, will be
classified in four categories: G —
acceptable for general audiences. M —
for mature audiences. R — restricted
to those 16 and older, although younger
patrons will be admitted if accom-
panied by parent or guardian. X—for
those 16 or older without qualification.
Religious groups which have been
the most severe critics of recent per-
missive trends in foreign and Holly-
wood films, notably the National
Catholic Office for Motion Pictures,
expressed guarded satisfaction with the
proposed rating system, pending
evaluation of its effectiveness.
The New Jersey in action off Vietnam
BULLDOZER FOR FLIES
THE RECOMMISSIONING of the
World War II battleship New Jersey,
now in action off the coast of Vietnam,
has been severely criticised in military
as well as civilian circles. It has been
called, among other things, “a mighty
sea-going monument to the futility and
folly of the South-East Asian war.”
The 45,000-ton vessel, after ten years
in the “mothball fleet,” cost $28 million
to restore to sea duty. It cost nearly $1
million to test her bulkheads, 16in.
guns, and decks for soundness after the
long period of idleness. A shipyard
force of 1000 men worked overtime —
16 hours daily, six days a week — to
ready the ship for her present assign-
ment. The ship was repainted from
stem to stern and the latest in electronic
circuitry was installed to make sure that
her shooting would be as accurate as
modern technology could make it.
After long months of sea trials and
crew training the New Jersey went on
station in Vietnam waters, sending
shells of 16001b. to 27001b. up to 22
miles inland at air-spotted targets. Her
skipper told observers and correspon-
dents after the first day’s action that
the ship had destroyed a storage area,
silenced four ack-ack guns, cut a road
in four places, and eliminated three
bunkers.
“Those familiar with the military
lexicon of this tawdry war,” commented
the San Francisco “Chronicle,” “trans-
lated this to mean that the shells made
some holes in a road, undoubtedly a
dirt one, that any foxhole with leaves
over it is termed a ‘bunker,’ and that
‘storage area,’ usually means any house
or other flimsy peasant structure.”
The newspaper added: “We will not
be surprised to learn that the strate-
gists who thought this one up are now
prowling museums in search of cross-
bows or arquebuses fit for restoration to
active duty. At least these would not be
as ruinously costly to the American
people, in whose name the New Jersey
is now shelling peasant huts—a sea bull-
dozer chasing flies.”
SOCIETY BITES NEWSMEN
THE AMERICAN NEWS media, par-
ticularly television, have been coming
under large-scale attack in the after-
math of the Chicago Democratic presi-
dential convention, with its wholesale
rioting and acts of police suppression.
“TV news stinks” has become a
familiar bit of graffiti in New York
City’s subway system. The CBS network
(like the other networks) has been
deluged with mail from viewers who
supported Mayor Daley and the police
clubbing of hippies by a margin of
eleven to one.
Richard Salant, president of CBS
News, said the hostility to the news
media “is more intense than anything
I’ve ever run across — it’s frightening.”
He thought the hostility arose partly
from the public’s need for scapegoats.
“They don’t like the world we’re show-
ing and they want to smash it,” he said.
“If you blame television, you don’t have
to face the problems of society.”
James Kilpatrick, a conservative
political columnist, who supported
Mayor Daley’s repressive measures,
said: “My mail ran 90 to 95 percent in
favor of my position. Most of the
country felt the coverage of the con-
vention was biased against Daley.”
All newspapers were receiving
unusual amounts of “hate mail.” Some
editors likened their plight to that of
the unlucky bearer of bad news who
was beheaded by the Persians for his
unwelcome tidings. This is not a new
phenomenon in American history.
During the Civil War mobs sacked news-
paper offices and attacked reporters
and editors. James Reston, executive
editor of the “New York Times,” said
the news media had to ride out the
temporary storm. “Emotions are high,
which makes it difficult to do the news
job, to hold the mirror up to the
world,” he said.
AFTER THE CZECHS?
HIGH ADMINISTRATION officials
in Washington fear that Rumania and
Yugoslavia may suffer the fate of
Czechoslovakia as a consequence of what
Secretary Dean Rusk calls the “new
Soviet doctrine.”
Officials of these countries, the two
most independent Communist nations in
Europe, have confessed their fears of
Dean Rusk...rebuffed by the Russians
armed Soviet intervention to American
diplomats, Washington sources dis-
closed. Dean Rusk has therefore
ordered the State Department to draw
up contingency plans as to the course
the U.S. should follow in the event of
further Soviet military forays.
Russia’s new hard line toward the
satellites has called into question the
American policy of “building bridges”
to Europe, a hallmark of the Johnson
Administration’s foreign posture. This
was based on the premise that Moscow
would allow its allies a measure of
independence, so long as Russian
security was not endangered, and would
encourage East-West contacts by them.
But any further bridge building would
seem futile, with Russian troops
stationed at the European end of the
bridges.
Dean Rusk attempted to bring up
the subject of the new doctrine during
his private discussions with Russia’s
Foreign Minister Gromyko at the United
Nations, but was rebuffed. He also
stressed American concern over the
doctrine in discussions with foreign
ministers from many countries gathered
for the General Assembly. Rusk is
seeking clarification from Moscow on
the implications of the doctrine.

THE JOHNSON LEGACY
“WE HAVE DONE some difficult
things together,” the President said.
“We have done some easy things
together, but we have never done any-
thing together because it is easy. What-
ever we have done, we have done
because we thought it was right. The
pressures of the moment, the propa-
ganda of the time, and the criticism
of superiors and inferiors, wherever they
may be, have never deterred the loyal
soldiers in uniform or the civilians who
supported them from carrying out their
orders and doing their duty for the
land that they care about so much.”
President Johnson has decided to
bequeath the task of settling the
Vietnam War to his successor rather
than be hurried into a “peace without
honor.” That is why he has turned
a deaf ear to demands by his political
opponents at home and the North
Vietnamese negotiators at Paris for an
immediate bombing halt in Vietnam,
which would presumably speed up the
peace talks.
The President is reportedly unwilling
to yield to the various pressures at
home and abroad and possibly commit
an “act of weakness” in order to
achieve a. settlement in Vietnam before
he leaves the White House next
January. If he cannot obtain some kind
of reciprocal action from Hanoi,
President Johnson is determined to
turn over to the next President the
best possible negotiating stance in Paris
and the best possible military and
political situation in South Vietnam.
“The president did not take all of
Shis pain in Asia to have a fake peace,”
ran Administration aide declared. “It’s
igoing to be the real thing with John-
son or it’s going to be nothing.” He was
said to be conscious that time was
growing critically short, but he also
believed history would prove him
Tight in the end.
The President emphasised standing
fast on principle in a farewell speech
at the Pentagon to the military and
■civilian officials of the Defence Depart-
ment.
The President’s faith in the correct-
ness of his course in Vietnam was
strengthened by a recent optimistic
report from U.S. Ambassador Ells-
worth Bunker regarding steady military
and political progress in Vietnam.
President Johnson was also resisting
political suggestions that a halt in the
bombing would help Vice-President
Humphrey in his badly lagging cam-
paign for the White House. The Presi-
dent was reported to feel that such a
move might backfire politically and
leave both the President and Vice-
President vulnerable to Republican
charges that they were willing to kill
American soldiers to win an election.
The President maintains that a bomb-
ing halt without some matching move
by the enemy would produce an
immediate increase in Allied casualty
lists in Vietnam.

Universities as big business
By JAMES RIDGEWAY
AMERICA’S 2200 colleges and univer-
sities are the largest body of secret
organisations in the nation. The trustees
of the private institutions are self-
perpetuating groups who meet in
camera and do not publish reports of
their operations. Although the regents or
trustees who rule public universities
periodically hold open meetings, their
real business is transacted at confiden-
tial executive sessions. The universities
have been so successful in safeguarding
their privacy particularly with
respect to their finances that few
people are aware of the extent to which
the worlds of higher education, big
business, and banking are linked
through interlocking relationships
among professors, college presidents,
and trustees, industry, and government
relationships whose chief victims are
the more than six million students the
universities are supposed to teach.
In fact, the American university
today resembles a conglomerate cor-
poration. Its sprawling enterprises in-
clude graduate institutes, computation
centres, and propaganda headquarters
where sociologists test the citizenry’s
political attitudes. There may be cam-
puses in Madrid, Florence, or Lima,
and teams of researchers carrying out
inquiries for AID or CIA in Ethiopia
or Thailand. The university may own a
press, a ball park, a couple of hotels,
some ships, and—for complete divers-
ification —an amusement park. Some
holdings are more exotic: Purdue, for
instance, ran an airline for a time;
Dartmouth has a timber-producing
forest; Connecticut’s Wesleyan put out
a children’s magazine, the “Weekly
Reader,” before selling it to Xerox for
several million. The University of Wis-
consin is responsible for the world’s
leading rat poison, and New York Uni-
versity gets the profit from a spaghetti
factory.
Very likely there will be a defence-
systems laboratory or an AEC installa-
tion near the campus and a sprawl of
companies created by some of the pro-
fessors. These academic entrepreneurs
who dash back and forth between
campus, government, and business see
themselves as renaissance men.
The defence - electronics business
started this trend. But nowadays the
“spin-offs,” as the professors’ companies
are called, may sell educational games,
run Job Corps camps, schools for small
children, community - development
centres in the slums, or prepare a
“menu” of options to better motivate
laggard black businessmen.
Deans and presidents take a benign
view of such activities, often encourag-
ing the professor to start a new com-
pany and then sitting on its board of
directors or that of a local bank, where
they can lend a hand in financing and
co-ordinating the whole works. The
older graduate students provide cheap
labor pools, useful for keeping the
undergraduates in tow and for assisting
the senior professors in carrying for-
ward their inquiries within the uni-
versity or in some private company.
Teaching undergraduate students is not
specially interesting compared to work-
ing on the outside in one of the new
companies, and some professors tell
you it is now obsolete as well: the
students learn more by working in the
“real world laboratory,” which is to
say on a professor’s experiment outside
the university. They refer to the profit
motive as the “reward structure.”
An archetype of the new arrange-
ment is at Stanford University in Palo
Alto, California. On part of the 9000
acres left to the University by Leland
Stanford there is now an industrial
park which houses 50 companies, also
involved in research and development.
They keep in close touch with the Uni-
versity’s electronics laboratory, whose
scientists pioneered in the development
of vacuum tubes and microwave equip-
ment. One, for example, is George
Barry, a radio engineer and physicist.
When two of his colleagues figured out
a way to measure the area covered by
Voice of America broadcasts, Barry
quit his job as professor and, with his
colleagues helping out in their spare
time, started the Barry Research
Corporation, which submitted the win-
ning bid for the new equipment. An-
other Stanford scientist helped the
Government to evaluate the proposal.
Stanford realises a million dollars a
year in leases from the companies in its
industrial park and it operates as a sub-
sidiary the Stanford Research Institute,
a non-profit organisation which grosses
$25 million a year and has offices
around the world. Attracted by all this
activity, another 200 companies
hunker about the edges of Palo Alto.
An even more impressive model is in
the environs of Cambridge, Massachu-
setts. Studies by Edward B. Roberts
and Herbert A. Wainer, of the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology, indi-
cate that more than 100 different com-
panies were begun by professors
departing from MIT labs and academic
departments. While the bulk of their
business at first comes from Govern-
ment contracts, after four or five years
40 percent is in commercial markets.
The new companies needed very little
to begin with, usually starting on per-
sonal savings of a few thousand dollars.
Once operating, they were able to tap
ample sources of risk capital around
Boston.
One energetic business organiser
among the Cambridge intellectuals is
J. Sterling Livingston, a professor at
the Harvard Business School, who has
established half a dozen companies.
During World War II Livingston ran
a purchasing course for the Navy at
the Harvard Business School and then
went to Washington to straighten out
the Navy’s nearly incomprehensible
purchasing instructions. Back at the
school after the war, Livingston wrote
a thesis on Government procurement
policies; subsequently, the Navy asked
him to continue as an adviser on
procurement methods. Since the Dean
thought it improper to conduct this
business through the school, Livingston
organised a company, Harbridge House
Inc., whose sole business at first con-
sisted of telling the Navy how to im-
prove procurement methods. Harvard
and MIT professors served as con-
sultants, and one of Livingston’s part-
ners was Paul R. Ignatius, who is now
Secretary of the Navy. As Livingston’s
reputation grew, the other military
services also hired Harbridge House.
During the Korean War the company
was grossing $1.5 million a year.
(Meanwhile, Livingston was still a pro-
fessor at the Harvard Business School.)
Next, Harbridge House was hired by
corporations doing business with the
Armed Services. In 1958, with Har-
bridge House making $3 million a year,
Livingston sold out his interest for an
undisclosed sum.
His next venture, Management Sys-
tems Corporation, again relied heavily
on professors from Harvard and MIT,
as well as Stanford. This company
helped the Navy, Air Force, and NASA
develop ways to keep tabs on weapons
and missile systems, and it, too, had an
annual income of about $3 million
when it was merged into a new firm
called Peat, Marwick, Livingston &
Co., a subsidiary of a large accounting
company, Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &
Co.
Princeton also is the centre of a
flourishing research and development
business. For instance, James R. Guard,
a professor on leave from Princeton, and
Tho'mas H. Mott, jun., of the Rutgers
faculty, work for Applied Logic, a com-
pany that makes programs for time-
shared computers; the firm also employs
five other Princeton professors in one
way or another. In remote Hanover,
New Hampshire, a Dartmouth professor
formed Thermal Dynamics, a firm that
makes special cutting torches. Another
company, Time Share Corporation,
opened offices near Dartmouth because
of the work in computer development
going on at the college. Dartmouth also
exchanges personnel with CRREL, the
Army’s cold-weather research lab-
oratory, which is nearby.
Sixteen spin-off companies have been


established since 1950 around the Ann
Arbor campus of the University of
Michigan. Probably the best known is
Conductron, which makes radar and
optical equipment. It was begun m
1960 by Keeve M. Siegel, then a pro-
fessor of Electrical Engineering at the
University. Siegel recruited 25 univer-
sity people, 15 of them professors.
Then Conductron shunted $250,000 of
research funds into the University’s
engineering department, where several
members of the company’s staff were
still professors. At the same time the
University handed out a $39,000 sub-
contract to Conductron. When the Uni-
versity’s laboratories performed ad-
vanced research in detection of under-
ground explosions, Conductron applied
these techniques to machinery for
evaluating data from underground ex-
plosions in oil drilling. In 1966 Siegel
sold control of the company to Mc-
Donnell-Douglas, the aircraft company,
and started another firm. He is esti-
mated to have made $5 million on Con-
ductron.
Another successful spin-off is Tracor
Inc. Begun by University of Texas pro-
fessors, the company now makes $5O
million a year, much of it for work on
defence systems. One of the most enter-
prising members of the Texas faculty
is Dr. George Kozmetsky, Dean of the
College of Business Administration. A
graduate of Harvard Business School,
he has taught at Carnegie Tech and is
one of the founders of Teledyne, a
highly successful electronics company.
Kozmetsky’s major interest lies in
projecting the management techniques
that will be appropriate to the new
organisation which will take shape over
the next 50 years. Kozmetsky believes
there is little to be learned by simply
making a study and then publishing it.
Rather, he advocates conducting re-
search and testing it by running it
through a “validation block” before
publishing the results and embarking
on more research. The validation block
is the “real world.” Kozmetsky is also
full of ideas about how the University
of Texas should exploit the oil lands
it owns. (The income from these hold-
ings is invested in a fund and worth
about $5OO million.) In recent years
the University persuaded the State
legislature to let it use some of this
capital to move into the mortgage busi-
ness. The University now supplies
mortgage money for housing in the
well-to-do sections of Dallas, Fort
Worth, San Antonio, Austin, and
Houston. In addition, the University
recently let its first leases for sulphur.
Kozmetsky also wants to develop potash
on the land and explore the possibilities
of harnessing solar energy. He would
also like to invest some of this fund in
developing a marine-sciences industry
in Texas through a consortium of
private companies, the University, and
the State of Texas. The marine-science
business has vast possibilities, including
the use of submarines for oil drilling
and transport, undersea berths for the
submarine tankers, recovery of minerals
from the ocean depths, dredging out
sand and gravel deposits which form at
the mouths of estuaries, seafood control
and production, and harnessing tidal
currents for the production of elec-
tricity. These are especially interesting
matters in Texas, since the southern
coastal area now little developed
could be the site of new towns. Some
of this land is owned by the King
Ranch, whose managers are close to the
University and looking for ways to
diversify.
The computer business is perhaps
the prime example of the new business-
university partnership. International
Business Machines, which sells 'more
than 80 percent of the nation’s com-
puters, dominates the industry. Com-
puters in operation around the country
are judged to be worth $7.2 billion,
and the market increases by 25 percent
every year. IBM achieved its supremacy
by shrewd and farsighted marketing
techniques. Nearly 200,000 college
graduates annually use computers; if
they all learned on IBM equipment,
their future employers would avoid a
training problem by buying IBM hard-
ware rather than another company’s.
To this end, during the past 20
years IBM has made discounts of more
than two-thirds on equipment to uni-
versities, which are themselves a rapidly
expanding market, using computers now
worth about $l6O million for plan-
ning, administration, and teaching as
well as for research.
By making research grants and offer-
ing the machinery itself at large dis-
counts, the company gets “free science”
as professors develop projects on IBM
machines which may result in new
products or new uses for the machinery.
IBM has secured its position at
major universities on both East and
West coasts. At UCLA in 1956 it
established an organisation called the
Western Data Processing Centre, which
was a dual operation between IBM
and UCLA. IBM provided the build-
ing that houses the computers, supplied
the machines, serviced them free, and
shared operating costs with UCLA.
IBM used half the computing time, and
the other half was utilised, without
charge, by UCLA and over 100 other
participating institutions. Thus for the
past ten years the University of Cali-
fornia acted as a salesman and train-
ing school for IBM equipment in the
West. Colleges and universities in
California now use about 100 com-
puters, far more than any other State.
Last year the Justice Department
began anti-trust inquiries into IBM
operations. The company pulled out of
Western Data Processing, and the
centre was renamed the Campus Com-
puting Network. IBM made a grant
of up to $5 million for UCLA compu-
ters over a five-year period.
Currently in vogue is the theory that
the techniques of syste’ms analysis em-
ployed in making complicated missile
and defence systems can be used to
solve political and social problems. In
other words, the engineers and scientists
who could send a rocket to the moon
could also learn how to build a fine
school system or end poverty.
The technique involves collecting
data, which can be built into a model
that will stimulate, or imitate, human
activity. If one could quantify human
activity—so goes the theory—one might
also be able to predict and control it.
These possibilities have given rise to
companies engaged in “social problem
solving.”
The proprietors of these organisations
come quite naturally from the univer-
sities and are generally eccentric, lively,
and amusing individuals. But it never is
altogether clear whether they know
what they are doing or, indeed, whether
they take themselves seriously.
Simulmatics Corporation among
the earliest—was organised in 1959 by
Edward L: Greenfield, a public-
relations man, and three professors—
There are profitable nuclear-research in-
stallations at a number of U.S. univer-
sities. This one, examining thermo-
nuclear reaction, is at Princeton
Ithiel de Sola Pool, of MIT, William
N. McPhee, of Columbia, and Robert
P. Abelson, of Yale. In the 1960
Presidential campaign the Simul-
matics predictions turned out to be
remarkably accurate, and trading on
this success the company went on to
other work. The company has made
models of the Venezuelan economy for
AID and drawn up a computer pro-
gram called Dynamark, which can
“assess brand loyalty” by evaluating
results of the test-marketing of different
products.
It also produces educational games,
including a very popular one for young-
sters called the Life Career Game.
Students are divided up into teams of
two or three people. Each team is
assigned a fictitious student, and the
idea is to plan a worthwhile life for
this hypothetical person.
The educational games were designed
by a group of professors at Johns Hop-
kins headed by James Coleman, then
marketed through Simulmatics, where
Coleman is a vice-president and direc-
tor. Simulmatics has purchased polling
data from the Furst Survey Research
Centre, Incorporated, which is owned


by Sidney Furst, who at the time was
also a vice-president and director of
Simulmatics. (Furst is no longer asso-
ciated with the company.) Simulmatics
hired its own vice-president, Professor
McPhee, as a consultant, through
Columbia Un.vers.ty s Bureau of
Applied Social Research, where he was
i a *l.l r
employed. lifty thousand shares of
Simulmatics stock are owned by Pool,
who is a professor and chairman of the
political-science department at MIT
and director of the research program
for international communication at the
Centre for International Studies. The
Centre was originally financed by the
CIA, and Pool sometimes consults for
the agency. Pool is mainly concerned
with propaganda. At MIT one of his
major interests is in studying mass-
media propaganda techniques in Com-
munist countries; on the side, through
Simulmatics, he conducts secret research
in South Vietnam for the Pentagon’s

While neither Pool nor anybody else
at Simulmatics will talk about this
work, the contracts ran close to
$700,000 in 1967 and in that year
accounted for three-quarters of the
firm’s business. Simulmatics maintains
a villa in Saigon and flies out graduate
students and professors from Harvard
and other universities to interview Viet
Cong defectors and prisoners, and
sample other groups among the South
Vietnamese population, with the hope
of devising a pacification program. In
addition to his stockholding, the pros-
pectus says Pool gets a minimum con-
sultant fee from the company of $5OOO
a year, plus $lOO per day in certain
circumstances.
A similar “consulting” firm is
Mathematica in Princeton. Oskar
Morgenstern, the econometrician and
inventor of games theory, is chairman.
The firm put out a lavish brochure
with four pages of photographs of the
various Princeton professors whose ser-
vices were offered. But the University
put a stop to this form of advertising.
Another sought-after consultant is
Clark Abt, who is president of Abt
Associates. Now in his late 30s, Abt
graduated from Johns Hopkins, then
got a Ph. D. at MIT and went to work
for Raytheon, where he became
tnanager of the advanced-systems de-
partment. He now teaches an honors
seminar at Harvard. Abt Associates be-
gan in 1965 in a warehouse attic with
a handful of people and a small con-
tract. At present it has a staff of 120,
some 65 consultants from Harvard and
MIT, and grosses about $2 million a
year. Abt, like Simulmatics, survived
by first working for the military, mak-
ing counter-insurgency games, which
were then used as training devices.
Abt is now equally interested in
running schools and job corps camps.
The company also writes scenarios to
show how different countries will line
up in the future power struggles; works
on curricula for Creative Playthings,
a CBS subsidiary; and creates cost-
effectiveness models for government
agencies.
While Abt Associates is at present
involved in a variety of endeavors, the
company is still best known for its
unusual games. It began by using
games to teach soldiers about pacifying
Vietnamese villages, and is now keen
to try some of the same concepts in
making games that poor children in the
slums can play—so that they can better
understand what is going on about
them. For instance, the company tries
to get teenagers to play the “white
middle-class confidence game.” This is
another way of persuading the young-
sters to go through the rigmarole of
applying for a job without losing their
tempers and quitting. They play at
going through the “chain of command”
—i.e., approaching a secretary, the em-
ployment counsellor, and so on.
The endowment funds of American
universities now total around $l2 bil-
lion. Harvard is one of the wealthiest
private institutions, with an endow-
ment of $1 billion. Decisions as to
where and how to invest these funds
are made on advice of the treasurer
by the six members of the self-perpetua-
ting corporation which runs the Uni-
versity. The treasurer is George F.
Bennett, who is also president of State
Street Investment Corporation, which
manages three mutual funds with assets
of $6OO million. It also handles invest-
ments for Harvard. (Francis H. Burr,
a partner in the law firm of Ropes
and Gray, also sits on the boards of
both the Harvard Corporation and the
State Street Investment Corporation.)
Bennett, in addition to his earnings as
president of the investment company,
draws a fee, said to be $25,000 a year,
from Harvard for investment advice.
While Bennett’s mutual funds in them-
selves are not very large, when he
combines them with Harvard’s funds
he enters the market with imposing
leverage. The arrangement between
State Street and Harvard was initially
set up by State Street’s founder, Paul
C. Cabot, who preceded Bennett as
University treasurer. Initially it was
specified that when securities held by
both Harvard and the State Street
mutual funds were involved the latter
would lead in buying or selling; so, at
least in theory' Bennett can purchase
a stock for State Street Investment
and then drive it up by using Harvard’s
money. Or, in selling, he can dump
a large holding belonging to State
Street and then sell Harvard on a lower
market. However, Bennett claims it
never works out like this, and that,
oddly, Harvard often does much better
than the mutual funds.
State Street owns 485,000 common
stock shares of Middle South Utilities,
Inc., a holding company which con-
trols electric companies in several
Southern States, including Mississippi
and Louisiana. Harvard has 543,719
shares; Harvard-Yenching Institute, an
organisation devoted to promoting
higher education in Asia, of which
Bennett is deputy treasurer, has 18,668
shares; Bennett himself holds 2009
shares and is a director of the company.
In recent years Harvard undergraduates
unsuccessfully challenged the Univer-
sity’s Middle South holdings on the
grounds that the Southern companies
were managed by racists, members of
the Klan, and White Citizens Councils.
Bennett says he regards these utilities
as public-service companies, regulated
under State laws: “I made a personal
investigation and satisfied myself that
the officers were law-abiding citizens,”
he said. When asked about the invest-
ment at a public meeting, Harvard’s
President, Nathan Pusey, said, “Our
purpose is just to invest in places that
are selfishly good for Harvard. We do
not use our money for social purposes.”
To manage its $5OO million endow-
ment, Yale has an arrangement not un-
like Harvard’s. This is done through a
firm called Endowment Management
& Research Corporation, whose Presi-
dent is Roland D. Grimm. A group of
Yale and Harvard graduates, with ex-
perience in managing ’mutual funds, are
directors of the company along with
three Yale trustees: J. Richardson Dil-


worth, the former Mayor of Phila-
delphia, who now works with Rocke-
feller Family and Associates; William
W. Scranton, former Governor of
Pennsylvania; and John Hay Whitney.
The company is paid a declining fee
over five years for managing the Yale
business, on the theory that as time
goes on it will use the Yale endowment
and its prestigious board of directors
to build business of its own, either by
getting other wealthy clients or by
starting a mutual fund. Unlike the
Harvard arrangement, however, Yale
comes first in buying and selling stocks;
the other customers, second.
Shortly after the company was
formed in 1967 it filed a registration
statement for an initial offering of $35
million in stock for a mutual fund to
be called Omega Fund. Shares of the
fund are now on the market, selling
for about $lO. Endowment Manage-
ment & Research manages its affairs
and controls its board of directors, on
which Dilworth sits. Carl Kaysen,
Director of the Institute for Advanced
Study at Princeton, is a director (at
an annual fee of about $6500).
Despite protestations to the contrary
by Yale officials, it is obvious that
Omega Fund must openly trade on its
Yale connections. After all, what other
reason would there be to purchase a
share?
Another way of getting into the in-
vestment business was pioneered by the
Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation
(WARF), established in 1925 to exploit
the patents to a revolutionary process
for synthesising vitamin D invented by
Dr. Harry Steenbock, of the University.
WARF’s function is to spot other useful
inventions in the University of Wiscon-
sin labs, carry on to development work
to bring them to the point of com-
mercial use, and then license them.
Royalties are invested, and from the
income the lab recovers costs, pays the
inventor his 15 percent share, and
donates the rest to the University,
mostly for building new science labora-
tories. While WARF won’t disclose the
size or content of its investment port-
folio, it produces about $2 to $3 million
a year in incomes for the University.
Among WARF’s products is “War-
farin,” a widely used rat poison which
earned $3 million in royalties before the
patent ran out. When it is combined
with sodium, “Warfarin” becomes a
useful anticoagulant that can be taken
orally by humans. Other patents now in
the works include a new and quicker
way to coat pharmacological tablets.
Through subsidiary companies WARF
operates a tourist business at the scenic
Wisconsin Dells, owns buildings, and
runs a laboratory which makes vitamin
concentrates.
Since WARF publishes no annual
reports, one of its advantages is that
nobody knows much about its activities
outside the patents field.
Dealings between business and univer-
sities have on occasion led to murky
complications. One such episode
occurred in 1965 at the University of
Michigan and resulted in the resignation
of Eugene Power, who had been a
much-respected regent for nearly a dec-
ade. He was also president of Univer-
sity Microfilms, which sells microfilm
copies of out-of-date and rare books
and is now a subsidiary of Xerox. In
October, 1965, the campus newspaper,
the “Michigan Daily,” reported that
University Microfilms in effect enjoyed
a monopoly in copying graduate
students’ theses. University Microfilms
was also making profitable use of a
valuable book list prepared by the Uni-
versity library. The company had set
up its equipment in the library base-
ment where it could photograph fragile
or rare books which could not be taken
out of the building. The State
Attorney-General, Frank Kelley, began
looking into the matter and Power left
the board. Kelley later said, “There is
no question of Mr. Power’s motives,
his integrity, or his devotion to the
interest of the University . . .” He
added, however, “For Mr. Power to
maintain his position as a regent while
his company has its present relation-
ship with the University is inconsistent
with the requirements of the Michigan
constitution relating to ‘substantial con-
flict of interest.’ ”
Subsequently, at Kelley’s request the
State legislature passed new conflict-
of-interest laws. Kelley interpreted them
to mean that officers and directors of
banks and companies that do business
with State colleges cannot sit on the
school boards. Thereafter, University of
Michigan President Harlan Hatcher
quit his job as director of the Ann
Arbor bank, where the University keeps
its payroll. (He has since retired as
president of the University.) John A.
Hannah, president of Michigan State,
resigned as director of two banks. Six
trustees at Eastern Michigan Univer-
sity and Western Michigan who sat on
boards of banks that did business with
those Universities quit as trustees of the
schools. And six other University
officials, including the president of Cen-
tral Michigan and Eastern Michigan,
resigned as bank directors. Shortly
afterward, the “Michigan Daily” un-
earthed some highly questionable real-
estate deals involving University officers
at Michigan State.
Unpleasant incidents of this sort have
rarely come to light. Indeed the cozy
relationships between universities and
industry are widely considered not only
respectable but desirable. For example,
Franklin D. Murphy, who until 1968
was chancellor of the University of
California’s Los Angeles campus, also
sat on the boards of Ford Motor Com-
pany, Hallmark Cards, McCall Corp.,
and the Times Mirror Company, which
publishes the Los Angeles “Times.” The
last two companies were also rep-
resented on the University’s board of
regents. When I talked with him,
Murphy conceded that the relationship
between universities and industry
created some problems. “If you have
your professors running around con-
sulting all over the place, they are not
around to talk to students,” he said.
“If you can keep it under control,
and I think that there are ways that
you can manage this at the university
level, this is enormously valuable from
my point of view. Number one, it
does provide this necessary expertise
(something that the French and Ger-
mans want to talk to us about—how to
strengthen university relationships with
industry when both need it). Secondly,
it does provide for the university pro-
fessor the technique of guaranteeing to
some degree that he will not be in an
ivory tower and that he will be dealing
in the teaching process with things that
are germane and contemporary, not
entirely theoretical. The students to-
day are talking about relevancy, and
the way to get relevancy is to have
people who by personal experience
know what is going on in the real
world.” In 1968 Murphy quit UCLA
to become chairman of the Times
Mirror Company.
Another university president with ex-
tensive business connections is Grayson
Kirk, of Columbia. Among other
activities he helps IBM with its educa-
tional program. Reciprocally, the com-
pany gave the University $1.5 million
for its current fund-raising drive. Kirk
also sits on the board of Consolidated
Edison; about the time Con Ed came
through with a large gift, Charles F.
Luce, the chairman, was made a
Columbia trustee. In addition, Kirk
is on the board of the Greenwich
Savings Bank, two mutual funds
Dividend Shares and Nation-Wide
Securities —and. is a director at Socony
Mobil. Kirk owns about $50,000 of
stock in these companies.
James Killian, who is now on the
General Motors Board, declined to join
it some years ago when he was presi-
dent of MIT. However, he changed his
mind when he became MIT board
chairman. Howard Johnson, his suc-
cessor as MIT president, sits on the
boards of Federated Department Stores
and John Hancock Insurance, among
others. Jerome Wiesner, former head
of the President’s Science Advisory
Committee and now provost at MIT,
is a director of several companies, in-
cluding Celanese Corp.
Robert F. Goheen, president of
Princeton, is on the board of Equitable
Life Assurance Society, which has a
sizable policy with the University;
James Oates, the Equitable chairman, is
also a Princeton trustee and heads the
trustee executive committee.
Something of a record is held by
Jess Davis, president of Stevens Insti-
tute of Technology, who sits on seven
boards: Carrier Corporation, Philip
Morris, National Biscuit Company,
Bethlehem Steel, Prudential Insurance,
First National Bank of Jersey City, and
Public Service Electric & Gas Com-
pany.
An exception to this pattern is Presi-
dent Pusey, of Harvard, who eschews
company boards. So does Yale President
Kingman Brewster, jun. “It’s a fright-
ful waste of time,” he says.

The
modern
style
TRENDS AND
TRENDINESS
Clothes as a conglomeration of nostalgia
LIFE IS SHORT, art long, said the
ancients with conviction. Today we
are more likely to claim that life is
long, or at least longer, and art
short.
There has always been “the glass
of fashion and the mould of form,”
but at no time has the glass been
so fragmented or the mould taken
so many shapes. Never has the element
of fashion, or fleeting changes in style,
moved into so many departments of
life where before it had no place. For
example, into business, with every so
often a new way of being an execu-
tive; politics, with candidates changing
their presentation as readily as their
policies; or medicine, with 1968 the
year of the transplant.
As evidence of the permeation of
change, we now have a new word.
Out of “trends,” which was itself not
much of a word, most at home in the
financial pages, have developed
“trendy” and “trendiness.”
You don’t have to be a profound
student of society to see the bright
side. Greater freedom, whether it is
to become a hippie or a yippie, or the
nation’s leader, comes out of greater
mobility and greater prosperity. We
must take the bad with the good of
this.
Nor does the ferment of change
mean that style as something of last-
ing value disappears. It just becomes
harder to isolate. Because someone is
working in a contemporary context
in any field (as a good example, Syd-
ney artist Ken Reinhard, part of one
of whose recent works is our cover)
does not mean that he lacks style and
Is merely superficially following trends.
THE WAY WE LIVE. While the
poor countries look on in envy, the
rich countries will move from the
industrial age, in which there has
been an emphasis on manufacturing,
into the “post-industrial” or “technec-
tronic” age (the age of technocrats and
electronics), in which the emphasis will
be more on services than on goods, or
perhaps even on wholesale social manip-
ulation. Whereas in the industrial age
power went to those who controlled
resources money, machines, men
in the technectronic age power is sup-
posed to go to those who control
brains, their own and others, without
which money, machines, and men will
lack meaning.
This process has moved fastest, if in
a patchy way, in the United States, and
second-fastest, in an even more patchy
way, in Japan. It is possible that Japan,
with more of its old order blown away
than that of the United States, might
later become the first archetype
technectronic State.
The processes of this change involve
enormous challenges and tensions
because of the painfully lopsided and
lurching style of its evolution. For this
reason the United States becomes a
crisis country. The Negro crisis is made
worse because the Negroes lack full
participation in the education system,
which, in a technectronic age, becomes
the main path to power and full social
participation. The revolts of the
students or the hippies represent a
romantic revulsion against the hyper-
rational demands of a brave new world.
The small-town traditions of Americans,
the conventional wisdoms of the older
business organisations, the intractabili-
ties of traditional political systems
creak and strain when faced with
threats to their very legitimacy.
At the same time, as there is a
materialisation of the long human
dream that there could be an age in
which material distress could dis-
appear as the rich societies move
into their lands of homogenised milk
and motel breakfast honey the old
ideals of self-denial seem to lack
economic basis. We pass from the puri-
tan ethic to the fun ethic, with results
that pass beyond mere questions of per-
sonal pleasure, reaching as far as views
of employment that see not discipline
and hard work as their basis but the
liberation of talent in the fanciful en-
joyment of a job. Tasks become games.
It would be false to see nothing but
selfishness coming up. With the
enormous increase in the power to
control destiny, we fnay be moving,
among other things, into the great
age of ideals, an age in which ideals
might sometimes be converted into
flow charts and then carried out, if
not always satisfactorily.
CLOTHES. There was a time when
any fashion magazine’s list of well-
dressed women could be relied upon to
include at least one who said rather
grandly that she bought only two “very
good” outfits a season.
In those she stated her personal style.
When she wore the two very good out-
fits, she felt inevitably right and invio-
late from more transitory fashion con-
siderations. There are still women who
think that way and say so, but not as
positively as they once did, and the
people who agree with their view are
few.
Unlike past years, when Paris and
the occasional film were the sole
influences on what people wore, these
days fashion trends hit hard, fast, and
from a multitude of directions. Now
clothes have more distinctive influences,
and so have shorter lives.
Since as short a time ago as 1965,
we’ve been subject to a variety of
fashion impulses, beginning with the
mini-skirt and Mary Quant and her
takeover of the ready-to-wear market.
Art nouveau, Aubrey Beardsley,
flared trousers, Regency frills, sequined
’thirties dresses, resurrected fur capes
... a conglomeration of nostalgia that
somehow worked itself into a recognis-
able trend.
Then the hippies sprang up in
America, with beads, bangles, psyche-
delia, and a different set of nostalgia
references. The headbands, the painted
faces, and the high-crowned black hats
belonged to the Red Indians, the hippie


symbol for the dispossessed, the robes
and flowers to the East, where presum-
ably, all the answers on how to stay
cool and avoid materialism were to be
found. But American comedians per-
sisted in telling jokes about mythical
teenage sons who wanted to be hippies
but couldn’t afford the robes.
By now, all these waves have long
broken and swept over us, and we seem
to be momentarily in the trough before
the next one, free to add up the traces
that remain.
An enduring element is probably the
mini-skirt. Clothes seem to become
briefer as we move faster, so there’s no
immediate reason for it to disappear.
The maxi-skirt didn’t even achieve the
status of a trend, while the mini-skirt
has inspired a new underwear industry
which has grown up around mini-skirts,
“panti-hose,” and “stay-up” stockings.
Changed fashions in clothes become
almost a social revolution in the new
democracy in which cheaper ready-to-
wear is no longer couture’s poor relation.
Ready-to-wear has a style of its own,
and while it may not yet have eclipsed
Paris it has changed it. Thus for the
first time not only do the young dictate
fashion to the old but the woman of
modest means tells the rich what to
wear.
The process now governing men’s
fashions is a trend in itself. Manu-
facturers are employing the services of
well-known designers and tailors who
have suddenly abandoned their disdain
for the ready-to-wear market, and new
influences are received and disseminated
with computer-like speed.
For those dedicated to trendiness,
keeping up grows harder all the time.
Fashion is no longer a series of set-
pieces changing at a decent and
dignified pace, but a kaleidoscopic scene
recommended only for the McLuhan-
oriented.
EDUCATION. For the technectronic
age the alternatives in education are
seen in America and Japan. Both are
now education-based societies, both are
concerned with quantity as well as the
old “quality.” But America is rich
enough to pour wealth into its educa-
tion system so profusely that it does not
final'y pick and choose its elites until
the post-graduate schools (and even
then allows for mistakes so that late-
developers can still get in); in Japan
the education system is excruciatingly
competitive and, as in France and some
other European countries, the best
careers are open only to the best
examination-passers. But in both coun-
tries it is education more than any-
thing else that provides access to
success.
At the same time, as nations become
more affluent, greater ambitions can be
developed for the function of education
as a way of broadening human poten-
tial. In the most examination-conscious
countries there is still a disciplinary
mood (which causes revolt). In others
affluence produces a new permissiveness
(which also causes revolt). But, as
affluence becomes more real and more
general, both trends may merge: success
will still be based on education, but
education will have become more lib-
erating (and probably cause more
revolts).
THE ARTS. The idea of revolt in
the arts began so long ago that it is a
tribute to human conservatism that it
can still attract so much attention. The
pace quickens. Whereas, to begin with,
it took a generation for one revolt to
succeed another, something new now
comes out of the arts by the year or
the half year. It is in the arts that find-
ing the distinction between significant
trends and passing trendiness becomes
most difficult.
Since “modernity” began in 19th-
century France the underlying
trends have reflected either the eager-
In executive style, the new is the John
F. Kennedy, the old, the outmoded,
delegatory style of Dwight Eisenhower

for bored hours of obeisance at
school
ness of the artist to realise the modern
world or his inability to do so, mani-
fested in either the retreat beyond
meaning or the retreat into the anti-
quarian. But in the upsets this causes,
so much rubbish can float on the sur-
face for reasons of trendiness that con-
temporary criticism becomes as difficult
as intelligence operations in the United
States or the Soviet Union. What is
significant in all these reports that
come in? What is mere “noise”?
RELIGION. God may be eternal
or dead but today’s religion is
eclectic and seems ephemeral. Nowhere
do the zephyrs of trendiness blow more
erratically than down the aisles of the
churches.
Religion now might be character-
ised by someone wearing a representa-
tion of some unknown, unworshipped
ancient god on a chain around his neck.
Or he might be wearing a crucifix.
Which is a matter of mood not con-
viction. He may listen to a Bach chorale
or tape-recorded voodoo music. He
may read the Bhagavad Gita or pick
up Teilhard de Chardin. He may still
fill in forms as C. of E.
Some religions, notably Judaism,
remain intractable to trend-setting.
Even Elizabeth Taylor and Sammy
Davis Jr., could not break down the
Jewish unwillingness to proselytise and
its resistance to becoming fashionable.
But trendiness has touched , most of
the Christian denominations. The
rocb-’n-roll vicar and the with-it parson
are easily recognised figures, in
television revue at least.
The great example of what
can happen when an institution
with a recognised style is in-
filtrated by fashion is the
Catholic Church. At one time
the only thing in the Catholic
Church that was swinging was
the censer. At this time
Catholicism held a strong
attraction for people who
wanted things to have a definite mean-
ing, who wanted to know where they
stood. Then, under good Pope John,
the Church began to move into the 20th
century. The results of this major shift
in style were quick to show. The' Evelyn
Waugh-type convert began to disappear
and figures for conversions to decline.
What was the point of joining a church
which had given up plainsong and the
Mass in Latin and in which the lesson
might be read by the local chemist?
Might just as well stay in the Church
of England.
What are known sometimes as the
“Eastern religions,” and are generally
something like Buddhism, have suf-
fered even more from the heavy-footed
pursuit by the trend-followers. But,


Castro and Che Guevara represent not
the end of ideology but a search for new
ones
perhaps, somewhere in some remote
ashram some Maharishi who has never
even heard of the Beatles meditates.
THE EXECUTIVE. In theories of
executive styles extreme delegation is
now well on its way out. The new
style is of a kind of supernatural and
discriminate involvement in which the
chief executive, although knowing how
to see to it that things go on without
him, nevertheless butts in as his intui-
tion and the antennae of his brains-trust
prompt him. He is above all sup-
posed to exercise a genius for absorb-
ing in his head all those disparate
factors in which he alone can see
the new connections that can lead
to new policy. The emphasis is still on
forward thinking, but, especially in
politics, the reality of decision-
making has been faced by the
theorists and there is now a
considerable body of literature
on “crisis management” (which
has not, so far, been of much
use in a crisis).
Since almost all theories of
executive style begin in
America, the now outmoded
delegatory style is thought of
as the style of Eisenhower; the
new style of involvement is
seen as the style of John F.
Kennedy. There is probably a
new style coming up.
FOOD AND DRINK. Elegance is
gilded in layers around the restaurant;
the cuisine and the couture are as haute
as you’ll find in Double Bay or South
Yarra at half-past ten of a Thursday
night. Only the table manners are out
of place. They are primitive. Knives are
gripped like pencils, forks are flourished
like tridents at a pageant, and food
meets mouth half way. The young man
in the trendy powder-blue turtleneck
shirt knew how to lecture on his choice
of Hunter Valley red, but he doesn’t
know that he is making his attack on
tournedos look like a theatre of
embarrassment. There . . . he’s just
talked with his mouth full and lost a
pea.
In the assiduous promotion behind
the food and drink industries’ deter-
mination to make meals “fashionable,”
nearly all the emphasis has been on
purchase and preparation and hardly
any on the style of consumption. There
is something grotesquely medieval about
the sight of a TV cook salivating over
one of his dishes.
Only discrimination and/or income
keeps food trends reined to sensible
levels; only sanity keeps us from join-
ing the wine writers in hyperbolic baths
of the stuff. There was something ironi-
cally desperate about a women’s-maga-
zine poster which recently announced,
“How to Give a Wine and Cheese
Party.” Is it as difficult as that? One
has manic thoughts of long evenings of
indigestion in the cause of some
transient gastronomic fashion. And will
fondue-pans join jaffle-irons in discard
at the back of the cupboard when some
commercial kitchen decides it is time
for a “new” taste sensation?
Although nothing beats simplicity as
the best style in food and drink,
simplicity is constantly under assault.
Surely something of the fundamental
flavor of an old-style chop picnic is lost
when it becomes tricked out in portable
barbecues, folding chairs, ice chests, and
transistor radios.
Parents used to give their children
guessed-at glimpses of the future by tell-
ing them that the day would come when
each meal would simply be a matter of
gulping down a pill. That day has
come but only, by choice, for astro-
nauts. With vast industries dependent
on our stomachs we are force-fed with
such a cornucopia of instant, energised,
protein-enriched, giant economy - size
pre-packaged food that voluntary
starvation is now often the only means
of personal survival.
IDEOLOGIES. When the long-lasting
ideological rigidities of the 19305, 19405,
and 1950 s appeared to dissolve at the
beginning of the 1960 s (perhaps more
than anything else because of the force
of President Kennedy’s Cuba confron-
tation) there was talk for a while of
an end of ideology and of a new prag-
matism. What seemed really to be hap-
pening was a destruction of old
slogans and speech patterns, a final
clear-up of the puffing and blowing of
the 1930 s that extended beyond the
affluent world to the poor nations. It
was not only the reputations of
Dulles and Khrushchev which were
agonisingly re-appraised: Nkrumah and
Sukarno also took a topple.
But this does not seem to have been
so much an end of ideology as a search
for new ideologies with a different basis
of differentiation. Among a few, Mao,
Castro, and Guevara combined improb-
ably to end the discussion for both
conspiracy theorists on the right
and romantics on the left, if in dif-
ferent ways. But elsewhere in the intel-
lectual spectrum colors blurred. Things
shift and change as new senses of crisis
develop that puzzle both those who try
to do up some old beliefs so that they
look like new and those who, with
greater percipience, try to find new pat-
terns in a new confusion.
To almost all intellectuals the Rus-
sian occupation of Czechoslovakia came
as a challenge to their new positions,
a fact that perhaps reflects the besetting
failure of 20th-century intellectualism
to contemplate the true face of power,
a fact which itself reflects the century’s
place in history as the century that
uniquely combined an unparalleled
expression of idealism with unparalleled
slaughter.
DECORATION. There is nothing
new in the veneration of antiques, but
today the admiration of most things old
and inanimate runs side by side with
the strenuous and successful attempt to
debunk them.
This seems to have had its beginnings
in Britain, in the urge of young people
there to turn everything which repre-
sented a staid and settled Mother Eng-

a lifetime.” There is a particular pleas-
ure for some young people in buying,
transforming, and, when the first enthu-
siasm for it has worn off, throwing
away some piece of furniture or
household object which in other days
would have survived a whole careful
generation, then been passed on to the
next. This is the affluent revolution for
those who really are not affluent, just
better off than their parents were.
It’s not hard to see why the revived
interest in antiques found such a ready
public here. The move to terrace houses
had begun long before in reaction
against the uniformity of “the triple-
fronted solid brick and tile” and the
vertical modernity of living in “an easy-
to-clean” home unit. When life is pared
down to “2 bdrm., liv. rm., bath, h & c.,
mod. k’ette, laundry” and a few pieces
of smoothly designed Scandinavian-
inspired furniture, it is hardly surprising
some people yearn nostalgically for a
little clutter in their lives.
The rebels and, since there are
enough of them, the trendsetters (after
all, trends usually contain the seeds of
rebellion against something) are. mov-
ing closer to the cities.
Suburbia-dwelling estate agents may
insist on telling them that industrial
inner suburbs are not the place to bring
up children, but they prefer that
hypothetical danger to the mental threat
of lawnmower obsession.
ADVERTISING. A few years ago
the big thing in advertising was
“marketing.” Now it is “creativity.”
Agencies used to tell clients how to run
their businesses. Now agencies concen-
trate on running themselves —a task
that seems to become more and more
complex.
The period when agencies were ex-
perts on marketing coincided in America
(which is the complete trendsetter in
world advertising) with the great
psychological revolution in which the
American business corporations became
skilled technocracies. Now that’s all
over they don’t need all those outsiders
nagging at them any more.
In America, at least, the emphasis on
“creativity” has itself contributed some-
thing to the growing literature on the
psychology of motivation and origin-
ality, but to a large extent it grew out
of it. Having at first congratulated
themselves on solving the problem of
organisation, the Americans then took
up the problems of de-organisation—of
organising organisations so that a sense
of originality was not organised out of
them. But, although mainly a by-product
of this new wave of theorising, the new
emphasis on “creativity” in advertising
also had the effect of making agencies
concentrate more on their end product
—viz., ads—with the result that there
have now been experiments, some of
them very profitable, with agencies that
shed research, media, and so forth and
concentrate on the manufacture of
advertising.
SMALL TALK. On the level of
person-to-person communication, the
prevailing influence is the success of
aggressiveness. Many of the demon-
strably successful people these days seem
to be those who are seen or heard to
lose their cool, to be rude, self-
opiniated, toweringly dogmatic, or
offensively cynical. Perhaps it was
always so and that the sophistication
of mass media these days simply makes
it more apparent. Pity the genuine
introvert.
Small talk has been sharpened by the
influence, although in cutting deeper it
hasn’t become more enlightening.
Instead of arguing their own opinions,
the couple of strangers fencing behind
martinis in the corner are probably
arguing from the pre-packaged bombast
delivered by last night’s television or
this morning’s radio. And the innocent
who stands there marvelling at the
technological achievement of global
telecasting is just about to be undercut
and barbecued because he hasn’t read
McLuhan.
Status is the fuel for most aggressive
small talk; those who don’t have it can
defend themselves with foggy dialogue
which is a currently useful Small-
talk word, along with charisma and
arcane. Those who neither have
charisma nor are arcane should avoid
the social fringes of cocktail parties and
first-nights.

Aborigines in politics
By FRANK ROBERTS
NO ONE KNOWS exactly what was
in the collective mind of the over-
whelming majority of Australians who
voted “Yes” in the referendum giving
the Commonwealth the right to make
laws for the Aborigines, and to count
them among other Australians in the
census. Subsequently Prime Minister
Holt proposed to continue to leave
Aboriginal welfare to the States’ field
organisations, with perhaps more
money from the Commonwealth. That
raised protests from interested people
who knew what “leaving it to the
States” could mean; a continuation of
“welfare” varying from genuine con-
cern to vapid paternalism to statutory
repression which had overtones of
apartheid.
There were few protests from the
Australian people in general, though,
which might easily have been the
result of that complex of circumstances
which continues to haze all issues con-
cerning the Aborigines consisting of
that race’s inability to communicate
its protests effectively, the Govern-
ment’s see’ming preference for fog over
facts, and the apparent further ina-
bility of people who know what’s what
with the Aborigines to get their ideas
across in self-evident places. What
average level-headed Australians don’t
know as a result of this can hurt
them, both internationally and at home,
if only because it leads them to allow
practices to continue which must, in
the end, explode in someone’s face.
The metaphor is apt because some
of those experimenting or about to
experiment with the welfare of the
Aboriginal people who are, after all,
one percent of all Australians seem
to me to have no more clear right to
do so than a very young child has the
inalienable right to tinker with a very
sophisticated chemistry set. Why else
(to begin at the top) does the Federal
Minister in Charge of Aboriginal
Affairs, Mr. Wentworth, state, on
returning from a visit to the U.S.A.,
that he was interested in giving
Australia’s Aborigines more authority
over their own activities, economic
authority which would enable them to
run their own businesses, and some
degree of magisterial authority, with
power to deal with drunkenness and
similar offences among their own
people?
These are worthy and necessary goals
but nothing is likely to show on the
Minister’s scoreboard unless he can at
least say how he proposes to achieve
any of them cutting, as they do,
across both the well-entrenched powers
of States and of the Northern Territory
Administration under the Department
for the Interior. Both public and that
part of it known as the Aborigines felt
that Mr. Wentworth had suffered in
credibility when he failed to get one
very small tribe, the Gurindjis, the
land they wanted in the Northern
Territory.
Does Mr. Wentworth know that
“magisterial authority” is exercised by
Aborigines on settlements in Queens-
land, which contain more than one-
third of the 130,000 Aborigines in
Australia and more than twice as many
as any other State? That the authority
exists over about 30,000 of Queensland’s
50,000 Aborigines in a context which
many Aboriginal leaders from Joe
McGinness (president, FCAATSI
Federal Council for Advancement of
Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders)
down condemn? Hear McGinness on
the subject: “Regulation 48 sets out
that Aboriginal courts consist of two
Aboriginal JPs ... or the reserve
council may function as such . . . each
Mr. W. C. Wentworth ...more
authority for Aborigines
Aboriginal council consists of four, two
elected and two appointed . . . (and)
is responsible to the reserve manager,
who can veto any decision it makes
. . . people dissatisfied with decisions by
the so-called Aboriginal court may
appeal to the District Officer or a
visiting justice . . . now it’s a funny
thing a lot of people have not been
told this is the right.”
And to police “offences among their
own people” the settlements in
Queensland have their own forces. At
Yarrabah, Cairns, reserve, which
changed over to a cash economy this
year, three sergeants and seven con-
stables are employed at from $lO-22
weekly. Many people might think it an
offence for such coolie rates to be paid
to any Australians.
If Mr. Wentworth knows how things
are in Queensland (and in the
Northern Territory and to some degree
in W.A.), he must realise that the
Queensland Government sees nothing
wrong with them and show’s no sign of
welcoming Federal interference. I
quote from the Queensland Legislative
Assembly Journals, September 11,
1968:
Question. —To where and on what
basis is it proposed to allocate the
$1,450,000 Commonwealth grant which
was made to assist the living and
educational standards of Aborigines?
Answer. —In advising as to the
amount proposed to be made available,
the Minister for Social Services and
Aboriginal Affairs intimated that such
amount was to be allocated for housing
—sBoo,ooo, health $325,000, and
education $325,000. The allocation
will, according to the customary policy
of 'my Government, be used to best
advantage when priorities are
determined having regard to circum-
stances and need of the various areas.
After reading that, I wonder is the
Commonwealth grant to be used merely
to replace State expenditure?
Both referendu'm and complaints
gave the Aborigines’ organisations new
vitality, especially FCAATSI, whose
president is a North Queenslander.
There was evidence of something like
interest in a new deal for Aborigines
in the referendum vote, and a stirring
among interested “friends.” South
Australia under Premier Dunstan was
shaping an anti-discrimination Bill,
pressure was building for Aboriginal
reforms in Victoria, and in N.S.W. a
Select Committee inquiry had created
a climate in which Aboriginal welfare
might begin to mean better things
ahead for 23,000.
In that time of hopefulness, a Torres
Strait Islander named Eddie Mabo
approached the Townsville Trades and
Labor Council to suggest a conference
on Aborigines’ status after the referen-
dum. The TLC interested the Mayor,
and in more time (of discussions,
checks, rumors, opposition) than I have
to relate it, an inter-racial seminar was
arranged for December, 1967, with,
finally, four addresses by Professor
Charles Rowley, Dr. Colin Tatz, and
FCAATSI president Joe McGinness,
and secretary Faith Bandler.
It seems to have been a worthwhile
conference of around 300 people, 40
percent of them Aborigines and
Islanders, though very few, perhaps not
so strangely, from the offshore Palm
Island settlement. Its manager was said
to have found more urgent uses all
weekend for the boat.
Although invited, the Queensland
Government did not send a represen-
tative, Departmental or otherwise.
Reading Joe McGinness’ address, it is
easy to understand why. “Under
Regulation 70 a man can be held in a
dormitory for six months before it is
necessary to report this detention to the
Director (in Brisbane) and for a further
six months . . . officers atithorised by
the Director—judges, magistrates, and
district officers—may make far-reaching
decisions as to where and how Abor-
igines and Islanders may live, may


penalise them and control their affairs
. . . those who are fond of talking
about civil justice may be interested
in part 4, clause 40, which provides that
hearsay evidence by a district officer
shall be admissible before a court judge
and that a plea of guilty accepted by a
court shall not be questioned on the
ground that the accused did not under-
stand the charge . . .”
That seminar was reported briefly
in Brisbane; Dr. Tatz wrote a short
article on it for the Melbourne “Age.”
Otherwise, good though it was, full of
meat and wisdom, it might never have
happened. Australians could have
learned so many new and different
ways of regarding Aborigines from it,
but as usual “abysmal” was the only
accurate word for the lack of com-
munication.
Unfortunately, the same thing has
happened this year; one of a series of
annual seminars was held last month at
Cairns. The only report of it which
reached Australians generally was one
of a matter so trifling in the general
context that it is hardly even material:
four out-of-town delegates to the semi-
nar were refused a drink in a hotel
saloon bar in Cairns. After a speech of
welcome in which the childish and
insulting analogy of a baker’s buns
coming out of the oven white, brown,
and black was the highlight, they
should not have been surprised.
Nor, perhaps, should one of the
speakers, University of N.S.W. re-
searcher Frank Stevens, have been sur-
prised that his seven examples of rough-
dealing with Aborigines in Queensland
did not raise the cries of outrage they
deserved. One of them concerned a
stockman for whom the Department
charged his employer a rate about
which he was never informed. Stevens
found the man’s bank book was being
credited with $l6 a week $4 below
the Department’s usual charge, which
in turn was $5 below the official rate.
The stockman later wrote to ask the
Protector if he would take up the
matter of underpayment with the
station owner. Eighteen months later,
the stockman is still waiting for an
answer.
Another instance: Stevens found a
man under the Department’s control,
which meant control of his bank book,
who had had £2OOO paid into his
account after an industrial accident, had
worked subsequently as a station man-
ager for £lO a week (the official rate
was £2l), but had only £4OO showing
in his pass book. “As the man had no
dependants, was given two issues of
clothing per annum, and was allowed
to go to town only twice a year, when
he received £lO out of his bank
account each time, it seemed to me
that there should have been more than
£4OO in his bank account. Later, with
his permission, I raised the matter
with the Protector, a police officer, by
registered post. His superior officer
acknowledged receipt of my letter,
stating that he was. investigating the
matter. That was two years ago. I have
heard no more.”
Stevens’ conclusions, in part, were
that “while certain individuals hold
arbitrary power over others (28,000-
30,000 others), while groups are isolated
from the broader stream of the Austra-
lian community, while there is contin-
ued restraint in contact between black
and white Australians . . . whether it be
through segregated schools ... or by
enforced isolation on reserves, then
there will continue to be grounds for
encouragement of abuses of authority.”
Actually, it seemed that he had pre-
pared unconsciously for the unruffled
calm of his audience, because the
reason for it was written into the
last sentences of his address to the
seminar. This was all old stuff to the
Aborigines of the North, who “. . . live
in a state of fear. With the conquest of
fear Aborigines might be brought into
an increasing role in our community.
If we continue to ignore the injustices
there is only one eventual solution for
the Aboriginal people and that will be
couched in the same terms of violence
to which they themselves have been
subjected over the last century and a
half. No amount of money could re-
place a frank and practical appraisal
of the system under which the various
departments charged with Aboriginal
welfare in North Australia allow their
charges to live.”
“New stuff” to the Aborigines, in
that it’s where much of their thought
lies these days, was contained in a
Land Rights address by Dr. Barry
Pittock, of Victoria’s Council of
Churches. Once again the ball went
into Mr. Wentworth’s court, for “hav-
ing promised to help all Aboriginal
groups who have a definite practical
plan to develop their land. This promise
needs to be put to the test again and
again, firstly in the genuine hope and
expectation that the Government
might help, but if help is refused the
facts must be made public knowledge.
“To all Aborigines wanting their
land, I say discuss and decide care-
fully what you want and what you
plan to do, listening to all the advice
you can get, then ask for what you
need, and if necessary fight to get it.
Many non-Aborigines will try to help
you when we know what is needed.”
Here, I think we might be back in
chemistry-set country. Land rights and
assimilation versus integration are issues
on which advice to the Aborigines
should be given in terms of alternatives,
to help them make up their own 'minds.
Probably their decisions on what,
exactly, they should “fight for” will
differ from locality to locality, and be
conditioned by such things as local
percentages of full-bloods compared
with those of lighter admixture. Even
then 'many problems such as “what the
young want” as against what their
elders might desire, or settle for, would
remain. Doing right by Australia’s
Aborigines at this stage in our history
is so nearly impossible that it cannot
be achieved without the thought of
the nation: it is no job to be left to a
handful of the merely well-intentioned.
If Australians do decide that the job
is worthwhile, so’meone will have to
see to it that they are given the stuff
from which good decisions are made
—ample information.
Aborigines
in court
By STAN SMITH
Aborigines in a Darwin hotel
“THE TROUBLE with Abos is they
can’t take their drink, not like a white
bloke, I mean.” This is by a European
truck-driver speaking as he sits in a
Darwin pub contentedly downing a
schooner of beer, his fifth, and watch-
ing a Northern Territory policeman
casually bundle an Aborigine in the
back of the paddy-wagon. “Ah, well,”
he said, “they’re only like children
really.” For the white population of
Darwin this just about sums it up.
Aboriginal arrests for drinking
offences in Darwin are ten times higher
than European cases, but Aborigines
are only one in 20 of the population.
Being drunk accounts for four out of
five Aboriginal arrests. The demon
drink seems as much a menace to the
Aborigine in the Northern Territory
as it was to the grimy slum-dweller
in nineteenth-century England. Abo-
rigines are arrested in the pubs, the
streets, back alleys, and the gutter. They
are woken up in the parks when sleep-
ing off a few beers and arrested for
being drunk. Men and women alike
are shoved in the paddy-wagons and
bundled in the cells. One of every five
Aborigines arrested is a woman. Until

a few months ago all Aborigines
arrested over the weekend were
kept in the cells until Monday morn-
ing without the chance of bailing them-
selves out.
Lately the arrests have decreased.
Mr. W. McLaren, Police Commissioner
of the Northern Territory, said there
had been no change in policy. “There
are just fewer arrests,” he said.
More Aborigines are being let out
on bail on their own recognisance and
told to report to the court on Tuesday
morning. The long crocodile of Abo-
rigines with tattered shorts, shoeless
feet, and shirtless black bodies is no
longer seen on a Monday morning on
its way from the police station to the
spacious, air-conditioned Law Courts.
Aboriginal defendants fall into
groups. There are younger male
Aborigines with regular jobs, good
wages, and not much else to do at
night except go to the pubs. There
are out-of-town Aborigines who come
from the missions and the settlements
(all of them dry as yet) and enjoy
to the full the right to drink. There
are the derelicts and the hopeless
alcoholics who go back to the bottle as
soon as they leave court or finish their
stint in jail. These older tribal men
would have been well looked after in
the old days in the bush, but addiction
to drink will keep them in the towns
and in the pubs unless some effort is
made to save them.
Monday morning defendants in court
look much the worse for wear after a
weekend in the cells, Aborigine and
European together. They offer a con-
trast to the uniforms of the police and
the white shirts of court officials and
solicitors. After an exchange of infor-
mation between magistrate and solici-
tors on adjournments of civil cases the
solicitors leave.
The police prosecutor rises and calls
out a name. “Johnny Possum,” he calls,
or some such name, and an old Abo-
rigine rises and shuffles to the police
prosecutor’s table. It sometimes happens
that two men come forward and police
and magistrate try to sort out the
consequences of the casual approach to
naming Aborigines in the past.
“Johnny Possum, you stand charged
in Darwin on the of
with being drunk in a public place,
how do you plead, Guilty or Not
Guilty?” The defendant whispers to
the police prosecutor and the police-
man says, “The defendant pleads guilty,
your honor.” No one in the public gal-
lery of a Darwin police court ever hears
the plea of an Aborigine. In the past
six months 97 out of every 100 Abo-
rigines have pleaded guilty to every
charge laid against them.
Mostly they plead guilty because they
say they have been told to by police,
friends, Welfare Officers, and, in a few
cases, by European and Aboriginal
members of civil-rights organisations.
They tend to say that if they pleaded
not guilty they would be sent to prison,
or tell a lie against God, or that they

didn’t know they could plead not guilty,
or that they didn’t know what not
guilty meant. Police prosecutors say
that Aborigines say “Fine Guilty,”
which means, they explain, that Abo-
rigines think that if they plead guilty
they will only be fined and not sent to
prison. What they think when they are
subsequently sent to prison no one
seems to know. Aborigines don’t yet
know that pleading not guilty is a right
as valuable as the right they know so
well, the right to drink.
The police prosecutor then reads out
the events leading up to the arrest:
“I approached the defendant, his eyes
were glazed, his speech was slurred, he
was unsteady on his feet, and he was
found to be drunk.”
“Do you have anything to say?” asks
the magistrate, and the black head wags
from side to side. Everyone takes this
to mean “No” but no one is sure. Abo-
riginal defendants are rarely heard
during the brief proceedings.
It is often shown that Aborigines
don’t understand what’s happening
when something goes wrong or they
plead not guilty and they have to speak.
No test is given of English comprehen-
sion. In cases of doubt Johnny or Billy
is asked in a loud, clear voice, “Do you
understand?” and everyone holds his
breath in case he says “No.” He never
does, of course, and honor and
conscience are satisfied. No Welfare
Officer is seen in court watching for
signs of poor comprehension. Welfare
claims that an interpreter is available to
any Aborigine who wants one. No one
has yet, however, worked out how an
illiterate, non-English-speaking Abo-
rigine in custody can go up to Welfare
and say, “May I have an interpreter
please?”
Interpreters are available in higher
court cases as a matter of course, but
justice, it seems to many people in
Darwin, should have no conditions.
These people have been increasingly
vocal in the past few months. Mission-
aries, Aboriginal-rights workers, and
some solicitors are keenly aware of a
need for a system of interpreters for
Aboriginal defendants.
Only one case is known of in the
past six months where an Aboriginal
defendant in the lower court got an
interpreter for a drunken charge, one
out of some 150 similar charges. This
man was, in the events convicted with-
out penalty as a first offender, because
he said that all the policeman said was
true. The interpreter was asked after-
ward about the Aboriginal word for
policeman. This was, he said, a similar
word for an evil-spirit man. Asked if
the same word was used for the magis-
trate, he said, “No.” (There is no inter-
preter problem for the 5000-strong
Greek community in Darwin.)
So, at the end of it all the magis-
trate looks at the familiar charge sheet
and pronounces his sentence. On
drunken charges for Aborigines it seems
to work out at fines for five or six
charges and then a period in jail as a
kind of reminder that the law doesn’t

look kindly on drunken Aborigines. “I
feel you have to be taught a lesson,”
says the magistrate as he looks at the
bewildered defendant and sends him to
jail for seven days, the most usual
sentence for incorrigible tipplers.
Fourteen percent of all Aborigines
sentenced were sent to jail for various
reasons in the past six months. This
doesn’t include Aborigines sent to jail
because they didn’t pay a previous fine
or those who go to jail because they
didn’t have the money with them when
fined and, because of their record, don’t
get time to pay. It’s a good job that
Aborigines don’t take going to jail so
seriously. They call it the Green Hotel
on the Hill, because of its color and
its situation on top of a hill in the
plusher part of Darwin facing the
tropical seascape of Fannie Bay.
Nearly 260 Aborigines were defend-
ants in lower-court cases in the past
six months. Not one of these is known
to have been discharged. At an average
of $5 per head, plus an average of
$1 costs, the arrest of Aborigines will
probably show a profit in any financial
year, even with the free meals given
when in custody. As one detective
said to another when 43 defendants
were in court one Monday morning,
“What a lovely day for consolidated
revenue.”
Remarkable comments can often be
heard by police in this town of self-
styled racial tolerance. “You should
have pleaded guilty instead of wasting
everybody’s time,” said a police
prosecutor to an Aboriginal defendant
just after an adjournment for a witness.
And after the man was convicted the
same prosecutor said to the .man when
the magistrate left, “And now you’ll
know the difference between guilty and
not guilty I hope,” words hardly likely
to inspire respect for the arm of the
law.
Very few Aborigines go to higher
courts. Apart from drunken charges,
Aborigines get convicted mainly for
fighting, drinking metho, being rogues
and vagabonds, and disorderly con-
duct, in that order. Drinking metho
is a heinous crime in Darwin. With
very few exceptions, drinking metho
always draws a sentence of 30 days or
more, European and Aborigine alike.
Over the past six months, the 260
Aboriginal defendants before the courts
represented one in four of the Abo-
riginal population of Darwin. A lot
of these, of course, are regulars. The
magistrate looks down at the same
faces as the police prosecutor tells him
the defendant is known. The same
record sheets with new additions are
handed up for another inspection.
Aborigines never pitch a hard-luck
story, they never say how they’ve just
been in hospital or lost a job or how
they’ll make good if given a chance.
They accept their little docket in silence
and walk out of the court looking the
same as they came in, silent and lost.
“I see you’ve done it again, Tommy.”
“Yes,” he’ll say and walk into the
sunshine, down the road, and into the
pub.


Making free with their opinions
By SANDRA HALL
DWARFED by a gigantic collage
twisting its way across an entire wall
of Paddington’s Gallery A, in Sydney,
people were busy balancing conversa-
tions, claret glasses, and plates of beef
burgundy and French salad. TV’s
Diana Ward was supplying name tags
to newcomers and Andrea was saying
she never made up her mind about
things without knowing the facts. That
morning somebody had asked why in
the world she’d want to go along to a
Civil Liberties party, and she’d said
she’d let them know when she came
back.
For most people who have sought
out the Council for Civil Liberties in
the five years since its formation,
adversity rather than curiosity has been
the motive. The Council has given
legal assistance in a wide variety of
cases where it has been satisfied human
rights have been infringed. And last
week, at its first Australian convention
in Sydney, it officially turned itself
into a national organisation with
branches in every State.
The Press luncheon at Gallery A was
the curtain-raiser. The real show
opened several days later when about
200 Council members gathered at a
Sydney hotel to discuss censorship,
abortion-law reform, the legislation on
vagrancy and prostitution, the role of
the police in the courts, and invasions
of privacy.
Politically, it was a diverse group
and traditional Party lines were
blurred. The N.S.W. Minister of Jus-
tice, Mr. Maddison, opened the con-
vention by saying the Council was “in
a good position to enunciate principles
in a clear, unemotional, non-political
way and pass them on to governments.”
Liberal MP Mr. R. J. B. St. John and
Senator Murphy, Leader of the Oppo-
sition in the Senate, were equally
vociferous in their belief that the law
should contain more positive safeguards
for the rights of the individual.
Since Council members included
people of divergent political views,
Right- and Left-wing labels seemed
more inadequate than ever. But inevit-
ably, the police and magistrates were
cast in the role of “heavies,” and most
speakers had complaints about
“oppressive” or “anachronistic” laws
and faults in their enforcement and
administration.
Mr. St. John advocated the abolition
of police prosecutors in favor of inde-
pendent barristers and solicitors, Dr.
Duncan Chappell, of Sydney Univer-
sity’s School of Criminal Law and
Criminology, condemned “the arbitrary
and potentially unjust nature of inde-
terminate sentences” against habitual
offenders, and Mr. Ken Buckley, a
Sydney University lecturer in Economic
History and founder of the Council,
attacked the N.S.W. Vagrancy Act for
giving too much power to police and
magistrates. His was probably the most
forceful criticism, invoking as it did the
spectre of police corruption and
officiousness.
He saw elements of racial, political,
and class prejudice and a bias against
non-conformity in the N.S.W. Vagrancy
Act, producing some colorful examples
to illustrate “the vague and imprecise”
nature of the offensive behaviour
charge including the case of a 17-
year-old youth fined for poking his
tongue out at a police car, and a woman
charged for wearing a live lizard on the
front of her dress.
The vagrancy law he condemned as
being of use “only against the very
poor, the down-and-out, and the
drifters.”
“A man is all right if he has money
or possessions which have been acquired
lawfully. The chance of having well-to-
do parents who are willing to make an
allowance to a son or daughter-in-law
—or from whom money has been
inherited can make all the difference
between freedom and prison.”
A different kind of discrimination,
he said, was practised against prosti-
tutes. Prostitution in itself is not a
criminal offence, but the courts have
held that a prostitute’s earnings from
her trade are not lawful means of
support.
“On the other hand, if the prostitute
has done very well, has saved money
from her earnings and invested it, and
can prove that such investment provides
her with sufficient means of support,
she is safe. Investment is a good
bourgeois habit, not to be discouraged
in any way. The moral for a prostitute
to draw from this legal distinction is
that she should make her pile quickly,
buy a block of flats and live virtuously
off the rents.”
Mr. Buckley also deplored the law
which gave police the alternative of
charging prostitutes with offensive
behaviour or the more serious offence
of soliciting for immoral purposes.
Police usually preferred the less
severe charge, in principle a tolerant
attitude to be applauded, he said, before
negating the tribute in the next
breath. “Yet, there is a more dangerous,
hidden aspect of the procedure. The fact
that a policeman, if he wishes to be
vindictive, may lay the much more
serious charge of soliciting or vagrancy
means that the prostitute is open to
blackmail. There is no doubt that some
policemen derive a considerable illegal
income from this.”
It was the job of Inspector C. G.
Bush, the acting senior N.S.W. police
prosecutor, to reply to Mr. Buckley,
and he decided to do so with an air
of bluff geniality. He wasn’t, he said,
in opposition to Mr. Buckley in as
many aspects as you might expect, or
as Mr. Buckley had expected when he’d
suggested they shake hands before his
speech, since they mightn’t be friends
afterwards.
But, he suggested, “the poor old
cop” had been labelled “the real rogue
and vagabond,” whereas he was more

“the meat in the sandwich." ("We don’t
make the law, you know.”)
Introducing the figure of “the average
man,” who cropped up repeatedly in
speeches opposing the papers, Inspector
Bush reminded everybody that it was
this hypothetical Mr. Average who
counted most, not minority groups
“either right, left, or in the centre.”
It would be much easier for the
policeman if he could go “stepping
over the prone bodies of hippies, long
hairs, methos, and the like,” but
vagrants went to court as patients under
the Inebriates’ Act. They might not get
any treatment, but that was a matter
for the authorities rather than “the
poor old policeman.”
As for bribery, “policemen are easily
condemned without proof.” “If anyone
can give us the proof,” Inspector Bush
said, “I, the Commissioner, and other
members of this wonderful force would
be pleased to hear it and to act on it.”
As Mr. Maddison said in his opening
speech, being arrested is usually
regarded as something that happens to
other people, but most Australians are
affected by censorship, whether they
know it or not. And David Stratton,
Director of the Sydney Film Festival,
had some disturbing evidence of its
severity and its inconsistencies.
“Hardly any film let in is shown
without some sort of censorship. The
Censorship’ Board is cutting scenes of
violence more savagely than ever before,
so that fairly average films which would
have been let in ten years ago without
cuts are being censored heavily. Some
of the routine Westerns, for example,
are emerging as something of a
muddle.”
There had been unsuccessful
attempts, Mr. Stratton said, to change
the current censorship system by
classifying films with “X” certificates
as done in the United States, but it
had met with “massive objections from
the distributors because it would mean
loss of money to them if children were
barred from some of their films.” But,
as things stand, films of interest to
minority groups were the ones most
affected.
Mrs. Beatrice Faust, of the University
of Western Australia’s Law School,
delivered her paper on film censorship
with devasting astringency in the
deadpan manner in contrast to her
material, which was anything but
deadpan.
Guying the censcfrs, she said, was an
unproductive pastime, since they
could make fools of themselves without
any help from academics. Nevertheless,
she didn’t pass up the opportunity to
tell what by now must be the classic
of all anti-censor stories. It concerns
Howard Hughes’ film “Outlaw” in
which Jane Russell made her debut:
“In one scene, the hero swaps Jane
Russell for his freedom, saying ‘fair
exchange is no robbery.’ The censors
objected to this, and suggested a
substitute phrase ‘tit for tat.’ Need I

say that it was readily received by the
producers.”
One of the intentions of Mrs. Faust’s
paper was to get rid of the “ridiculous
miasma concerning pornography.”
There was “an extraordinary lack of
candor or clarity on both sides”
something of which she could not be
accused, since she’d decided no
discussion of pornography could be
successful without presenting examples
of it.
As regards pornography, the active
motive was curiosity, she said. But the
censorship laws had introduced a second
motive profit. “The ‘Kama Sutra’
cost $lO on the black market when it
was banned. Now it’s possible to buy a
copy for $l. The people who suffer most
from the obscenity laws are those whose
freedom is unjustifiably curtailed, not
those who traffic in pornography.”
Sooner or later, Mrs. Faust said, any
discussion of censorship reaches the
question of criterions for objectivity:
who’s to say what’s obscene?
“You could object to obscenely
designed buildings or clothes, or as
Oscar Wilde would have, obscenely
ugly people. Pornography is not a
clearly defined genre. Obscenity resides
not in the concept but in the way it’s
presented. Toilet - paper ads, for
example, are masterpieces of indirection
by which nobody is offended.”
According to Mrs. Peggy Wallace,
vice-president of the Abortion Law
Reform Society, abortion is another
issue clouded by emotional inhibition—
“something a lady doesn’t talk about.”
“Most men are pretty liberal about it.
But women who’ve had abortions won’t
admit it ever happened.
“Others object to abortion-law
reform because of sexual inhibition,”
Mrs. Wallace said.
“It’s not really the thought of killing
a child they object to at all. They
think, ‘we don’t want all those girls
running round enjoying themselves’. Yet
I do think most women want the law
changed they want it accomplished
without having to fight for it.”
Vagrancy, prostitution, and abortion
were the grandstand issues of the con-
ference because of recent legislation and
police action, but there was just as much
interest in a paper with the unsen-
sational and off-putting title of “Com-
puterised Dossier Compilation,” pre-
sented by John Henshaw, president of
the Civil Liberties Association of
Western Australia.
In a country like Australia, where
the more obvious civil liberties are
taken for granted, most people are not
especially militant about upholding
them, so the idea set out in this paper
—of the computer age’s insidious
erosion of the rights of privacy is a
frightening one.
There have already been stories about
credit agencies and their practice of
labelling people “bad debts.” One dele-
gate to the convention told of a friend
who’d bought a television set which
became defective before he finished
paying the purchase fee. His reaction
was to withhold the fee until the set
had been repaired, but the company
wouldn’t repair it, so he continued to
refuse the fee, became a “bad debt,”
and was later refused finance to buy
a car by another company.
Mr. Henshaw, in his paper, visualised
an extension of this kind of dossier sys-
tem in the future, with the use of com-
puters now available. United States
authorities already feed into a data bank
the contents of all income tax returns,
and, in Henshaw’s view, it would be
only one more step to establish a
centralised data-banking system with
dossiers on everybody.
“Police departments, health depart-
ments, agriculture departments, and a
multitude of other governmental and
semi-governmental authorities have
information which they would find it
helpful to store in the same way.
“The most expensive element in a
data bank is the actual computer. One
computer can handle a large number of
Senator Lionel Murphy...sup-
porting a bill of rights
sets of information, so that there is the
temptation to economise by using only
one computer for a group of authorities
or all authorities. From this emerges
the possibility that all public-data banks
become submerged into one enormous
filing system of information for the
whole country.”
The Press was principal villain in a
paper titled “Invasions of Privacy” put
forward by Mr. John Bennett, secretary
of the Victorian Council for Civil
Liberties, but Mr. Bennett also voiced
apprehensions about phone-tapping and
the use of “bugging” devices.
The convention received plenty of
attention in the Sydney newspapers and
when Mr. R. M. Hope, QC, the Coun-
cil’s president, advocated an Australian
bill of rights, it provoked discussion in
editorial columns.
Those against a bill of rights say it
restricts the power to legislate, but
Senator Murphy, one of a small band
of Labor senators supporting it, said:
“It’s a desirable way to ensure our
freedom and, in this age, we need insur-
ance. There’s a tremendous enlargement
of Government and private bureau-
cracies and real danger of the submer-
gence of the human personality, we
need new defences for personal freedom
in our Constitution and our laws.”

THE
EXPORTERS


In pursuit of a fertility symbol
By BRIAN HOAD
THERE IS A CURIOUS symbol
plastered across the country this week;
in offices and shops, washrooms and
canteens; it’s on the factory floors, on
the streets, and on the railway stations;
it’s been sliding on to television and
cinema screens and it’s even been seen
lurking in the pubs.
Although it is the symbol of Export
Week, it appears almost aggressively
determined not to be associated in
any way with the boomerangs and
kangaroos of its forerunners in the
national campaign stakes. At first glance
it looks like a broken E—for Export—
and yet there is nothing decrepit about
an annual growth-rate in exports of 6.4
percent over the past ten years, even if
7 percent has been set as the new and
necessary target for the next ten.
More appropriately it could have
something to do with Efficiency
plenty of room for improvement
there ■ — an essential key to successful
exporting and, more importantly, to the
general economic growth of the
country.
Efficiency is the shine on the
potential profitability which attracts the
overseas creditors. A great deal more
money is going to have to be borrowed
and massive amounts of capital
attracted here yet. Potential creditors
are going to be interested in just how
efficiently Australia uses what it already
has and one indication of that is just
how rapidly the gross national product
can be made to grow. For the past
20 years it has shown an average annual
growth rate of 4.5 percent. It currently
stands at a healthy 5 percent and
for appearances’ sake it is best to hold
it there.
Exports certainly have a part to play
in preserving Australia as an attractive
investment proposition; adding directly
to the national product (13 percent of
it last year); preserving trade deficits
(not bad things in themselves for a
young and developing debtor nation)
at a “reasonable” level. But if
unreasonable gaps show any signs of
developing bearing those overseas
creditors in mind there is no alter-
native but to rally round the export
flag, for to chop away at imports (with
some 75 percent of those essential to
the growth of the country) is to make
matters worse. But for the moment the
capital and the essential imports are
still flowing in; and Export Week
is as much concerned with using them
efficiently as it is with closing trade
gaps.
If the symbol could be a broken-
down E it could equally well be a com-
pletely ravished P, sunk on its knees
after the latest wage award and the
Arbitration Commission’s complete
dismissal of Productivity. Not that the
Commission hasn’t been doing that for
the past 20 years, in practice, generating
unhealthy inflationary pressures, making
productivity increases more difficult to
achieve, and generally adding to the
perennial export difficulty of competing
on cost.
With wages and prices rising and
productivity lagging behind, it was
little wonder that that grand old motto
of “exporting rubbish to the boongs”
was a long time dying; the easiest way
to competitive prices in that sort of
climate is obviously a cut in quality.
But it just does not work that way
any more. The “boongs” want refrig-
erators now, simple and cheap models,
but good ones. And if Australia can’t
produce a reliable enough product at
a cheap enough price, then the Japanese
can.
There is nothing comparable here
to the quality control imposed on
exports from Japan; but Australian
transistors are selling in the U.S.,
photographic equipment in Germany,
cricket balls in England and clothing
in Hong Kong. Some exporters are
achieving the impossible and competing
in price and quality with the coal in
Newcastle. The symbol could well be
a Quality symbol, too.
Indeed, it is intended that it should
be, and a potent one at that. As a
registered trade mark it will be used to
identify those products on the home
market which the manufacturers also
export “obviously the best, as they
are successfully facing up to world
competition.” Executives, purchasing
departments, and housewives are to be
encouraged to think along these irre-
futable lines, and with internationalism
having a far greater sales appeal than
nationalism, the persuasion shouldn’t
prove too difficult. The logic runs

relentlessly on from there: excess manu-
facturing capacity which, with a bit of
thought and energy, could be efficiently
used up on export markets, and is
not, will increase as housewives turn
their favors to the product with the
symbol clearly for some exporters
that symbol is a very distinct G for
Growth. And so the good exporters
shall prosper and those complacent
manufacturers who laze in the shade
of protectionist umbrellas shall at last,
and quite properly go broke, despite
the umbrellas.
But first, the defectors shall be given
a chance to mend their ways. Archibold
White, managing director of St. Regis-
ACI and helmsman of the current cam-
paign has launched “a bombardment on
all fronts from all quarters with a little
concentrated rifle fire aimed at the
non-exporting manufacturers.”
“Some of them might be complacent
and lazy,” he explains, “but others
would simply be unaware that they
could export, even if they wanted to,
and still others just wouldn’t know
where to start.”
Mr. White sent out to a selected
group of these people personal invita-
tions to attend the seminars of Export
Week. There they should be learning,
among so many other things, that if
they are manufacturing 1000 articles
at a cost of $9B each and they are using
only 75 percent of their capacity in
the process, then production costs do
not prevent them entering an export
market where the same product sells
for $BO. They have their fixed costs
of manufacture accounted for, anyway.
So, ignoring those when calculating the
viability of using excess capacity for
export, they could well find that a
further 300 articles a week could
be turned out at a cost of $6O. Then
all they would have to do is find
the market to bring about increased
efficiency on existing capital equipment
(for Australia’s sake) and more profits
(for themselves).
Mr. White is particularly interested
in the profitable side of exporting. He
admits that it was idealistic visions of
“national effort” that got the campaign
off the ground in the first place, that
caused the committees and sub-
committees to sprout like amoebas, that
drew in Jaycee and Rotary and Apex,
TV and radio stations, 300 cinemas
and 7000 companies, a major propor-
tion of retailers and politicians, all
advertising agencies, floods of full-time,
part-time, and casual help to control
the snowball, and so many ideas and
suggestions that they simply couldn’t
be coped with. That was all splendid,
“generous beyond measure,” murmurs
Mr. White. But it all needed a more
sustaining vision; “Export action for
profit” the ravished P of Produc-
tivity takes on a more optimistic shape,
perhaps a symbol for Profits in the bud„
The .Government’s belief that
industry had to help itself in export
matters is being justified; not only in
the massive support that has rallied to
the cause but also in the simple prag-
matic notion that the most likely way
to a man’s sustained interest in that
cause is through his pocket. The Gov-
ernment has had for many years, and
has consistently improved upon, the
machinery to help the export effort
once it could be aroused. And yet in
that particular field of human manipu-
lation politicians are no more likely to
be successful than nagging wives
merely hardening the thick skin of
indifference.
Late last year in those somewhat
fraught days which followed the
decision not to devalue, Mr. White,
and some fellow members of the
Economic Development Council, went
in their purely advisory capacity, to
the Government to recommend a
national export drive. They emerged
with the advisory capacity of the EDC
changed: the EDC would sponsor the
drive, Mr. White would lead it, the
Government would give whatever
money was needed to get it started
and specific help as required; apart
from that the Government would sit
back and await developments.
That arrangement perfectly suited
Mr. White. A free-trader at heart, he
prefers a minimum amount of Govern-
ment interference in matters of trade.
And yet the current account deficit was
running persistently and dangerously
large. If the situation became really
serious the Government would have
no alternative but step in, devalue,
chop down on imports, screw-up the
credit restrictions, and keep holiday-
makers at home. To Mr. White any
such ideas are abhorrent, for everyone
the results would be uncomfortable and
for the country as a whole develop-
ment would be stunted. It is not a
matter of export-or-die. It is a matter
of putting the limited supplies of
money, manpower, and materials to
their most useful and efficient employ-
ment. That is what Export Week is
all about.
Someone or other asked Mr. White
why he had chosen to flaunt a fertility
symbol all over the country. He was
bemused somewhat by that. And yet
“on every front and from every
quarter” he has been throwing out
sacks full of slogans and ideas and infor-
mation. Some of it is bound to fall
on stony ground, some may lay dor-
mant for a while and some may take
root. A fertility symbol is a useful
thing to have around in the meantime.

What has Lot’s wife got to do with papermaking?
Little perhaps, except to alert us today as we go
forward in our world of rapid changes—looking
back tends to fossilise the vision that shapes the
future.
With this point of view, the ‘forward look’ is again
the toast of Associated Pulp and Paper Mills for
1968 —the Company’s 32nd year.
Back in 1936 the Company’s vision triumphed over
what many experts had said was impossible—the
production of pulp from short-fibred, hard wood
eucalypts. This shaped the future of one of
Australia’s greatest industries—fine papermaking.
Since then, millions of dollars in overseas exchange
have been conserved by these activities and added
to by export to many countries.
Associated Pulp and Paper Mills continues to be
a key factor in building the growth of our economy.
“We’ll take no random walk into the future”, they
say at Burnie, Tasmania, where they make fine
printing and writing papers and special wrappings,
and at Ballarat, Victoria, coated papers.
“We’ll go on researching new ground and seize
every opportunity to produce whatever change
demands in types and quantities of fine writings
and printing papers for the printing and publishing
industries in Australia.”

BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
Goodbye to a high-price
oil policy
MR. GORTON’S DECISION to
abandon the high-price policy for
indigenous oil will meet with broad
and general approval. It was a policy
devised in 1965 when the prospects for
finding substantial quantities looked
dim, and it could only be sensibly sus-
tained as long as indigenous produc-
tion was small relative to total con-
sumption.
To have kept oil prices substantially
above import parity would have added
a tremendous cost burden to the Aus-
tralian economy through forcing up the
price of all petroleum products. Tran-
port fuel costs would have risen by
perhaps 15 percent, the cost of bitu-
men for roadworks by somewhat less,
the price of heavy oils for industrial
furnaces, railway locomotion, and
lubricants by upwards of 30 percent.
It is perhaps not unrealistic to think
that the whole cost structure of the
economy would have been hitched up
by something like 10 percent. And
such a rise would have been completely
unnecessary. Esso-BHP are on to a
“goldmine,” as Mr. Gorton has said,
and even though they refuse stubbornly
to reveal their production costs we can
be sure that even at import parity they
are making a clear $1 a barrel profit.
Incidentally, it is worth pointing
out the incredible impertinence of this
partnership in even having asked the
Government to enforce a high-price
policy which would require the com-
munity to pay approximately $l2O .mil-
lion more each year for its petroleum
products, without revealing any of its
cost figures and without therefore
giving any indication what that money
was expected to go toward.
If import parity as a pricing policy
is eminently sensible, a number of the
details of Mr. Gorton’s statement look
very ill-considered and unthoughtful.
Mr. Bean, chairman of BP, was
quick to indicate some of the
ambiguities in the implementation
of the policy as announced. First,
there seems some confusion as to
how import-parity price is going to be
established. In background briefings to
the Press, figures over $2 a barrel have
been mentioned, but it is well known
that oil is landed in Australia at such
discounts on posted prices that the
real import parity is down around
$1.50. Is the Government going to
follow a real import-parity pricing
policy or just a nominal one?
Mr. Gorton claimed in his state-
ment to Parliament that his announce-
ment “will provide a firm basis upon
which industry can plan ahead.”
Unfortunately, it doesn’t. The oil
industry still doesn’t know how much
oil it will be able to import, the extent
to which it will be required to convert
its refineries to consume the lighter
Australian petroleum, or anything
about the enforced distribution of
indigenous oil between refineries. Oil-
search firms don’t know the future of
incentives, though the likelihood is
that they don’t have any future at all,
since most of the advice to the
Government is that they are not
needed. To create a firm basis for
planning ahead, the Government will
need to go on and sort out these
remaining questions.
It seems unlikely that the Govern-
ment will force refineries to take all
the Bass Strait oil immediately it
comes on stream, though this is
implied in Mr. Gorton’s statement.
Bass Strait oil is very different in
composition from that which most of
our refineries are designed to process.
It is also too light for the mix of end-
products which has been established
on the Australian market. As oil
expert Alex Hunter said at the Senate
What
are
the
costs?
select committee on oil last week,
insistence on all Bass Strait oil being
processed in Australia is “absurd.” He
pointed out there will be difficulties in
processing more than 50 percent of it
here. It will be better for the Aus-
tralian economy if the rest is sold
in Japan and the West Coast of the
U.S., where it will be able to be sold
profitably, gaining the foreign exchange
needed to pay for continued imports
of heavier Middle East oil. Incidentally,
the Bass Strait oil should be able to
undercut Middle East oil on these
jnarkets, since we have freight advan-
tages. And it has a quality advantage
over them, too.
THE ECONOMY
CAUTION AND RESTRAINT
IF THERE WAS general surprise at
the mild cautiousness of the Budget in
August wasn’t everything supposedly
running along nicely then? it should
have been completely dissipated by now.
Caution and restraint is the new order
of the day. If anything, the Budget
wasn’t cautious enough.
If it was intended as a deflationary
Budget to impress the Ai'bitration Com-
mission, then the Commission sadly
missed the point and continued their
inflationary practices. If it was intent
on impressing the foreign money
market speculators, then it did not
avert the collapse of the mining market
as the massive inflow of speculative
money from Britain sinks into decline.
And if everybody, including the Govern-
ment, were optimistic about the balance
of trade, then the $70.8 million trade
deficit in September (the highest since
August, 1961) should have added its
note of caution, too. Weighing in with
their own contribution last week, the
trading banks warned that some
restraint on the current high-growth
rate of advances may become unavoid-
able, as their liquid resources are in
decline. The restraint became reality
last Friday when the Reserve Bank
announced its decision to freeze the
trading banks’ liquidity a little further
by increasing the Statutory Reserve
Deposit ratio by a further 1 percent
to 9 percent and, in addition, to up the
maximum overdraft interest rate by
0.25 percent to 7.5 percent.
In its fortnightly economic advisory
service to management, W. D. Scott
and Co. currently draw their clients
attention to the higher interest rates
and the tighter money situation spied
on the horizon. The money markets
are going to have to face up to a few
problems in the coming months accord-
ing to Scott:
A stream of big share issues by major
companies, such as BHP, ACI, BH
South, and others. These big share
issues are going to impose a substan-
tial drain on the financial resources
of the monetary system.
The consequence of lower share
prices for mining stocks will be to
impart a greater sense of caution into
lending generally. Many individuals
are going to feel less liquid, and indeed
are going to be less liquid. They will
not have behind them the backing of
large amounts of high-priced shares.
Instead, they will be looking for cash
with which to pay their stockbrokers.
Thus, many individuals are going to
look like less credit-worthy propositions.
Some loss of international reserves
will probably begin to set in now.
The month of August may have seen
the end of the really enormous inflow
of speculative money from Britain. As
the underlying foreign-trade position
is still not outstanding, it is only to
be expected that the decline in the
international reserves, which the
Government has been expecting, will
begin to show up in the statistics.
Although the share markets are
suffering from shock, there will never-
theless be a big demand for money
from mining companies, whose explora-
tion and development programs are
going ahead no matter what might


be said about the prices of the shares
of these companies. Hence, there will
be some increase in the borrowing
pressure from such companies. They
will have to make their offers for
money look more attractive.
As a result of these various trends,
says Scott, it is only to be expected
that in the money markets generally
the price of money will tend to rise.
Clouds are also seen on the horizon
at the trading banks. According to
the quarterly survey by the ANZ Bank,
unless there is significant increase in
the trading banks’ liquid resources, it
will be difficult for banks to sustain
through 1968-69 the relatively high rate
of lending which was a marked feature
of the past twelve months.
Under the LGS (liquid assets and
government securities) convention,
banks have to maintain 18 percent of
their deposits in cash and government
securities. Any LGS assets in excess
of this convention, plus funds in the
short-term money market, are generally
referred to as “free liquidity.” The
margin of free liquidity indicates the
resources available to the banking sys-
tem for further lending. In July, 1968,
free liquidity amounted to 5 percent of
deposits, compared with 7.2 percent
in July, 1967. Over the current bi-
annual year, as a whole, a further
decline in trading banks’ liquid
resources seems likely, the ANZ points
out.
And yet for the year 1968-69, as a
whole, the demand for bank finance is
expected to be at least as strong as in
the previous year. A high level of
bank lending will be required to main-
tain the improvement in the rate of
economic activity, recently shown and
in prospect over 1968-69.
The ANZ points out that if main-
tenance of a high level of bank lend-
ing is considered to be in the national
interest, the Reserve Bank may con-
sider it appropriate to assist bank
liquidity. This it could do by either
releasing the trading banks’ funds
which are frozen in Statutory Reserve
Deposit or by buying bonds in the
open market. The Reserve Bank decided
to do neither and instead decided to
freeze a little more of the trading
banks’ liquidity.
Such a decision is very much tied
up with that ever-widening deficit on
the current account. The Reserve Bank
has smelt a possible overheating in
domestic demand leading to adverse
effects on internal costs and prices, and
so more punishment for the current
account. It is already suffering. Back
in August, the Budget statement
declared that the deficit this year should
be “significantly below” that of 1967-68,
but with a trade deficit of $133.3 million
for the first three months of the year
compared with one of $85.8 million
for the same period in 1967-68, hope
is not burning brightly. But as the
passionate exhortations of Export Week
are so energetically trying to push home,
it’s not hope but action which is going
to save the day.
MEN AND MATTERS
JONES LANG WOOTTON, which
announced a reorganisation of its Aus-
tralian partnership arrangements last
week, is a firm with a difference in the
property-development world. Unlike,
say, Hookers or Lend Lease, it handles
only business of clients, that is, it
works for fees and takes no financial
interest in the projects it handles, only
as property consultants—seeing them
through all stages from the drawing-
board to completion, and then, if
clients want it, managing them. So,
although it also buys and sells property
for clients, holds auctions and things like
that, perhaps, when the figure of $299
million or more property investment
which it has fathered since beginning
here 12 years ago (then under the
auspices of the old Collier and Mudge
partnership) is mentioned, it should be
remembered that this would be other
people’s money.
The Australian partnership came into
being in 1959, when the British princi-
pals of Collier and Mudge decided to
Robert Aldred
James Crockett
join forces with Jones Lang Wootton
in a combined operation on the firm
foundations laid by Collier and Mudge
in Sydney and Melbourne three years
earlier. In those days there were
three partners in the Australian show.
This number has been doubled and,
as well, there are numerous salaried
partners with small stakes in the business
now organised on a State basis in
all States except Tasmania. Curiously
enough, there is no senior partner as
such, and the six partners take the chair
at 'meetings in rotation. However, age
seems to count a bit, and Mr. James
Crockett, a chartered surveyor who
was originally with Collier and Mudge
when the Melbourne office was opened,
looks to have a slight edge in that
direction, though still only 54. He has
been in the property business practi-
cally all his working life, that is, when
he wasn’t serving in the Army (Royal
Artillery).
In Sydney, where the partnership
employs about 55 people as against ten
less in Melbourne, is one of the
partners John Robinson, at
44, slightly younger than Russell, but
like him a former Navy man (small
ships). He was with Collier and Mudge
in London before the war.
Although the U.K. end still has a big
stake in the Australian business and
can channel business its way, the aim
of future development is to interest
more strictly Australian clients. More
and more of these, such as the AMP
and the Wales, have been coming for-
ward in recent years to avail themselves
of what is a unique service in the
property field.
NOW IN AUSTRALIA, Robert
Aldred, managing director of Taylor
Woodrow International Ltd., the over-
seas operating company of the U.K.
engineering and construction group, is
checking up on current commitments
of $l5 million here. And strictly
according to the Federal Government’s
pleasure, he’s talking about re-forming
an Australian parent company in which
local public participation, up to 50
percent, may be invited; envisaging the
encouragement of local managerial
talent; and contemplating the usefulness
of Australia as a springboard for Taylor
Woodrow’s business in Asia and other
countries of the Pacific area. All this
is not necessarily imminent.
The company’s primary objective in
Australia was the growing West, and
Aldred is amazed at the casualness with
which they speak of $lOO million
development projects in that State.
Taylor Woodrow International has
designed and constructed a container
berth in Fremantle (six months ahead
of schedule) and is now working on
erecting a pilot potash washing and
loading plant at Cape Cuvier, in
Western Australia, and starting con-
struction on a primary crusher and
associated installations at Mount Tom
Price.
In property, it is developing and
constructing a large shopping arcade
in the heart of Perth, and in partner-
ship with a local company, Bond
Corporation, is developing a large area
of land at Yanchep, 30 miles from
Perth, and a city office development.
An Australian director of Taylor
Woodrow interviewed Aldred for his
first job with the group in 1946. Now
52, he first went into construction at
the age of 18, and during the war
built munitions factories, then was in
the Navy on construction and general
marine work.
In the nine years in which he has
held his present position, he has
travelled almost everywhere, and
secured contracts in the Far East, Latin
America, and Australasia.
He manages to spend about six
months of the year living at home in
Weybridge, Surrey, and relaxes at golf,
although, so far, a game in Australia
has eluded him.

NO GOLD MEDALS
FOR SWIMMING
AGAINST THE TIDE
THINGS MAY BE exciting over in
Mexico, but I’ve been having a lively
enough time performing in my own
private Olympics right here at home.
Having spent the past few weeks in
the market swimming against the tide
(and getting right out of my depth,
particularly in oil), I am ready to
challenge all-comers to see who can
lose most quickest in this unfriendly
market. The past few weeks have really
knocked the gloss off the year’s profits.
And Mr. Gorton’s remarkable efforts
have not helped things one little bit.
All I hope is that there are no more
stocks I hold whose market prices de-
pend on undertakings from Mr.
Gorton’s Government, now that we
know the value of governmental under-
takings.
Curious that the change in the oil
incentive price should have come when
the two Ministers responsible were not
at work; Mr. McEwen was away over-
seas and Mr. Fairbairn was away sick.
Not that the new arrangements are
nearly as bad as the stock market fears;
most of the projections of earnings
made by the experts in recent times for
BHP expected that the incentive pay-
ment would not continue after 1970, at
least in its present form. The impressive
big report on BHP from London
brokers Myers and Company, last
week, used $2.50 as the likely price per
barrel of crude instead of the $3.14 of
the incentive payment or the $2.30
that now appears to be the ruling price
for 1970-1975. Even at $2.30, the
Myers’ sort of sums suggest that BHP
is worth at least $16.25 and probably
up to $2O, even without it finding
any new major oil reserves, and there
seems no doubt that the Government
was pretty well aware of the fact that
BHP holds a lot more oil in reserve
than it has so far revealed; otherwise
the latest decision to remove the in-
centive would be foolish as well as
dishonorable.
Anyway, I am not selling my BHP
shares yet; they are worth a lot more
than the current market price and the
market will realise this sooner or later,
even though prices may well suffer in
the meantime from the heavy burden
of the coming new issue. It only needs
another couple of good oil discoveries
in Bass Strait to make them worth $25
on income prospects alone, quite apart
from their speculative appeal.
With all this talk of Olympic Games
and swimming against the tide, I had a
look last week at Speedo Holdings, the
swimwear and clothing manufacturer
which is supplying the swimsuits for 22
of the competing nations at Mexico.
This is a remarkable little company,
yielding a staggering 9.6 percent from
its 12J percent dividend that was well
covered by last year’s earnings of 17.6
percent on ordinary capital. This fol-
lowed a 55.2 percent increase in profit
in the year to June 30, following a 6.1
percent rise in sales to $4.7 million.
Admittedly, things at home are not
quite as good as this suggests, because
the only reason sales went up was that
exports rose 31.6 percent. This high
level of exports meant that the com-
pany had considerable taxation conces-
sions. However, next year Speedo plans
to 'begin production in England to
counter the effects of sterling devalua-
tion, so that British and other European
countries can be handled by the U.K.
subsidiary. Locally, sales were stagnant
because sales of knitted outer-wear
were affected by low-cost imports from
Hong Kong and Japan. Nevertheless,
things are certainly looking up and next
year’s profit gives every indication of
being better than last. Benefits from
improved efficiency and increased space
following the company’s completion of
its new warehouse at Artarmon are
already evident.
The market seems a little uneasy
about Speedo on two scores; firstly,
because its capital rose pretty sharply a
couple of years ago when it made a
placement to finance expansion, and,
secondly, because the company in
1966/67 had an unexplained stock-loss
of $40,000-odd, which it still is unable
to account for. In addition, it has
borrowed considerably on mortgage to
pay for increased fixed assets and can
no longer afford to make the sort of
profit-slip it made two years ago. At
only 65c, the shares don’t seem to have
much downside risk; they have been
as high as 76c this year and should
return to that level before long. I
bought 400.
I’m just going to grin and bear it
with my oil stocks. I fear that Oil
Search is a lost cause, but I’m prepared
to lose the lot on the offchance that
something may turn up in the ill-
fated Ini well.
Kitty stands at $2218.

BRIEFLY
The GCOnomy ’ Like a shot out of an election gun, the
Prime Minister, Mr. Gorton, announced a new pricing policy
for Australian crude oil: “This will mean that as from
September, 1970, for a period of five years, the price pay-
able for Australian oil should generally be neither higher,
nor lower, than the price now payable for overseas
oil, except for the effect of Australian coastal freights
- . . In the case of the oilfields discovered by Esso-BHP,
we have agreed by negotiation that there will be a
reduction in the prices Australian refineries are required
to pay up to September, 1970.”
The Reserve Bank has lifted the trading banks’
maximum overdraft rate by J percent per annum to
percent and the Statutory Reserve Deposit ratio from
Bto 9 percent (this latter in two percent moves).
The Governor, Mr. J. G. Phillips, designs “a cautionary
influence to the developing situation, without impeding
the underlying growth of the economy.”
A mingled chorus of praise and blame greeted the
Tariff Board’s classification of protection enjoyed by Aus-
tralian industry; the Prime Minister emphasised that the
list was only a guide and did not bind the Government.
Australia’s estimated value of farm production for
1968-69 is now put at $3,517 million, or about 15
percent higher than last year’s.
The markets’ Over most of last week, Australian
share markets provided a fair amount of evidence of
slowing down their retreat, but the Prime Minister’s
oil-pricing statement brought some downward shocks
on Friday. Investors are highly sensitive to special situations;
needless to say, most oils crashed.
In the event, BHP suffered a net fall of 95 cents to
$17.80. Miners to drop included CGA, $7.90 (down 20
cents), Western Mining, $10.20 (50 cents), and
Mineral Securities, $4.65 (85 cents). The newly listed
Consolidated Mining opened and finished below its 25-cent
issue price; the close was 18 cents.
Captain Products continued to climb by 70 cents
to $3.70. R. W. Miller lost 11 cents to hit $2.10.
A possible engineering strike and the end of the account
sent London down, though on low activity.
Light trading was also the rule on Wall Street,
giving dealings an irregular look.
Companies .* A rich prize goes to Hamersley Holdings
with the taking-over from the Hanwright partnership of
the vast iron-ore deposits at Paraburdoo (W.A.);
their development, to cost over $lOO .million, also takes
in Hamersley’s program for metallised agglomerates.
The reallocation of reserves by the W.A. Government appears
to have brought the establishment of a steel industry
in W.A. a good deal closer . . . The Robe River iron-ore
consortium, led by Daniel K. Ludwig’s National Bulk
Carriers, is bogged down by pricing differences with the
Japanese steel mills . . . Beach sands miner Murphyores
hasn’t been able to live up to prospectus forecasts,
losing $516,880 in the year to June 30; the group is still
running losses on below-target output and higher costs
. . . Goldminer Lake View and Star still suffers from labor
shortage and rising costs, and has unexpectedly gone
into lower grades; the nickel search with Consolidated
Gold Fields has been broadened . . . Better production
from Tableland Tin had to wrestle with depressed
world prices, so earnings went up only from $118,784 to
$220,248; the dividend is passed to conserve funds
and maintain liquidity . . . Greenbushes Tin expects an
operating surplus for the current 1968-69 year . . .
Auditors have queried Broken Hill South’s method of
reaching its last profit ... A relative kindness to
shareholders is practised by BHP, whose 1-for-14 premium
issue is payable in two a,mounts.
The U.K.-owned Sun Alliance group doesn’t want
to take over the MLC, but its deputy-chairman came out
from London to meet the board; he didn’t . . .
Sydney Mutual Insurance shareholders enthusiastically
embraced the grip of Daniel K. Ludwig’s Clutha
Investments, leaving Mr. L. J. Adler’s Fire and All Risks
out in the cold . . . Insurance goes pastoral once more
as the Colonial Mutual Life invests more than $1 million
in Squatting Investment.
Greatly increased tax and depreciation did not
prevent Ansett Transport Industries from sending earnings
up from $3,253,271 to $3,663,292 on revenue lifted
$l2 .million to $128.4 million.
Building and construction equipment supplier
Acrow Australia’s public issue will be 706,000 50-cent
shares at 80 cents each; a 12J percent dividend is forecast
for the current year . . . Blue Metal Industries has
showed a clear leap forward by shooting profit up by
percent to $3,222,219 and earning rate from 21.4
to 28.3 percent . . . Engineer Tulloch looked more positive,
too, turning a $239,209 loss into a $218,244 profit
and capping this with a 7 percent dividend . . . Leading
scrap-metal dealer Albert G. Sims earned less for
1968-69’s first quarter, but sees an improvement coming
in overseas prices.
Courage, brother, is the beer that’s now available and,
to help the company, its local share issue, seeking
$1.7 million, brought in $25 million oversubscription . . .
Thomas Nationwide Transport is apparently holding
back on buying R. W. Miller shares and Miller’s board
is receiving buying support fro,m a host of N.S.W.
sporting clubs - and a friend called Mitsui, of Japan.

THE LAND
Next steps after the cotton bounty
THE PHASING-OUT of the $4 mil-
lion cotton bounty, which in the five
years since its introduction in 1963 has
induced sufficient new production of
the staple to make Australia virtually
self-sufficient in most types of cotton,
is going to leave in its wake a host
of problems for marginal producers
and for the disposal of surpluses. But
these problems are more the product
of State planning for regional areas
such as the Ord Basin than of inflated
hopes of the mass of private growers
in the industry. They do nothing to
destroy the case for using bounties as
an aid to imports replacement, say, in
preference to the sort of protection
now afforded indigenous crude-oil pro-
duction in Australia, whose revision in
1970 is already casting its shadows.
The main trouble in phasing out the
cotton bounty is that, in particular,
it threatens to leave the marginal pro-
ducers on the Ord high and dry unless
some other form of assistance to them
can be arranged outside the bounty
arrangement, which for constitutional
reasons cannot be used to give preferen-
tial treatment to particular growers or
regions. State and Federal Ministers
were chewing over alternative financial
assistance possibilities last week with-
out so far coming up with an answer.
Apart from the constitutional aspects,
there were various other shadows over
the discussions.
One of these pertained to the hard-
core question whether cotton can ever
be grown profitably on the Ord and,
if not, would not this put the whole
scheme and its future expansion in
jeopardy? Another was, can export
'markets be found for the costly uneven-
staple cotton grown in the region?—
a question which, as well as raising the
compatability of special assistance to
exporters with GATT, led on to
another. It is possible after 20 years
of indeterminate (though not by any
means fruitless) research into cotton
growing in the Ord Valley that the
area will never produce a cotton of
high, even quality to compete in world
markets and with the superior types
grown in the eastern States. Then, of
even greater urgency, there is the ques-
tion of whether special assistance should
now be devised to get the Ord crops
sown in the coming season.
The plain fact, revealed by a Bureau
t)f Agricultural Economics survey of
the six main regions of the Australian
cotton-growing industry in the three-
year period to 1967, is that heavy losses
would have been incurred by Ord cot-
ton growers, but for the assistance of
the bounty. On the other hand, in
eastern States areas (notably the
Namoi Valley, the Murrumbidgee
Irrigation Area, and the Queensland
region), good, and in some cases spec-
tacular, results were shown in the period
(and are still being shown). Without
the bounty, Ord growers would have
suffered a loss of $6300 a farm,
whereas with the bounty their net cash
incomes (gross income less cash cost,
depreciation, and imputed costs of
family labor) averaged $19,800 (which
represented a return of 18 percent on
capital). The Ord’s net cash-cum-
bounty return per farm was just about
the same as that of farms in the Mur-
rumbidgee Irrigation Area. In the
MIA, however, even without the
bounty, growers made an average
annual profit of $5500 a farm over the
three-year period.
Namoi’s figures put all these in the
shade, of course. For Namoi, where
production averaged 9781 b. of lint per
acre (the highest in Australia) com-
pared with the Ord’s 7621 b., the survey
unfortunately excludes figures for
Anscott, the vast United States-owned
project which last year got about a
quarter of the total bounty paid to the
whole industry. The survey regarded
the operation of this company as un-
typical, so left it out. Nonetheless,
other Namoi farms beat the rest of
the industry hands down. They had
net incomes of $28,400 per farm with-
out the bounty. This jumped to $69,800
inclusive of the bounty, thus empha-
sising for the Government the need to
phase out the bounty and start thinking
more of how to help .the marginal
producers as special cases for assistance
given the national need of their pro-
duction (a moot point) and tangible
export prospects (equally moot at pres-
ent).
Thanks largely to the incentives
offered by the bounty, cotton produc-
tion has spiralled to 150,000 bales,
almost a fifteen-fold increase in five
years, providing cotton of quality equal
to anything grown in the world for
similar types. By weight this is higher
Picking cotton at Wee Waa (N.S.W.)
than local consumption of cotton. This
may suggest that further expansion of
the industry will depend on export pos-
sibilities, but, as about 15 percent of
Australian requirements have to be
imported (this is not so much because
some of the local cotton is below spin-
ners’ quality requirements but more
because certain staple lengths needed
by spinners are not yet produced
locally), some of the future expansion
will take place in producing, after the
necessary experimentation, staples now
imported and in meeting expanding
local demand in general.
At any rate, while it is certain that
acreage under cotton will rise in the
next season (10,000 more acres are
likely to be planted in N.S.W. alone),
the next phase in the industry would
seem to be one of marginal producers
reviewing the viability of their farms
in the light of the reducing bounty;
the more profitable producers attend-
ing more closely to spinners’ needs of
quality and special types now imported;
and attendance on the possibilities for
exporting cotton surplus to local re-
quirements and too costly (because of
high freight rates, Ord cotton suffers
in the local market in competition with
that produced in the eastern States).
The best hope of selling surplus low-
grade Ord cotton would be in Japan.
Until exports are established, it seems
a bit early to be thinking of arranging-
an equalisation scheme for the industry,
but there are already some thoughts ini
that direction, and doubtless such a.
scheme will follow in due course.
AGRISEARCH
THE ORD A GRANARY?
NOW THAT WE ARE deeply com-
mitted to immense expenditure on the
Ord, we should keep our eye on the
doughnut, not the hole. For the time
being, argument about economic con-
sequences is futile. Knowing what will
grow in how much quantity when
cultured in which way should surely
be our main concern at this stage.
The proposed new farms will not even
exist for another three or four years,,
and who can really say what products
the world will be wanting then and
what purchasing arrangements will have
been made to secure them? As we enter
the dangerous last third of this cen-
tury and come upon the predicted time
of famines, it is certain that food will
dominate world politics. The Ord
Scheme, costing less than half of the
fleet of F-llls, may yet turn out to be
one of our cheapest and most effective
defence weapons, as well as being the
most humane.

raised recently which may have some
validity is the neglect of research aimed
at rehabilitating the Kimberley cattle
industry. The point here, with an eye
to the hungry future, is that protein
deficiency rather than a calorie shortage
will be mainly responsible for any
nutritional catastrophies that befall.
However, as was mentioned in this
column only last week, investigations
on cattle production have, in fact,
started; and it must be remembered
that cattle live on plants. Naturally, the
research program at the Kimberley
Research Station is logically centred on
plant growth. Apart from the trials
comparing the performance of different
breeds of cattle under the harsh condi-
tions, the station is also conducting
experiments on fodder crops which
might be used to support them. Pos-
sibly the station should have been
showing greater interest in the develop-
ment of pastures for the area than it
has up to date. In addition, research
has been undertaken on cash crops
including cereals and oil-seeds. Perhaps
the station should be looking harder at
the possibility of growing proteinaceous
crops for direct human consumption
and cut back on the cotton investi-
gations.
Cotton, after all, is a glut on the
world market. We ourselves are already
largely self-supporting as a result of
expansion of the industry in N.S.W.
and Queensland. Moreover, cotton
is a less important fibre in these
synthetic days and hungry people may
begrudge the land given over to its
production instead of being used to
grow food. As the world recognises
more clearly the desperate struggle it is
facing in primary production, inter-
national agreements could be formed
based upon the natural factors control-
ling production instead of economic
conditions, which can be altered at the
stroke of a pen. Thus, those places
most ideally suited by climate and soil
to a certain type of cropping system
would be required to pursue that par-
ticular form of agriculture and the
farmers would be guaranteed a reason-
able reward for their discipline and
diligence.
FAO, the World Bank, philanthropic
organisations, and some governments
have lately come to realise that, in the
war they have been waging against
hunger, progress has been mainly
retarded by failure to organise produc-
tion, marketing, and distribution on an
international level. Up till now their
efforts have been concentrated on over-
coming the local biological problems
limiting crop yields. Often, having
solved these, a frustrating situation then
presents itself. The local farmers have
no incentive to apply the new tech-
nique, either because there is no nearby
market outlet or they can still be under-
sold by producers half a world away,
where growing conditions are more
favorable for that particular crop.
The studies on cotton on the Ord
have now amply demonstrated the kind
of yields than can be expected there,
the quality of the fibre, the cultural
practices to employ, the hazards
involved, and the means of dealing with
them. The work could now be wound
up and the findings deposited in the
archives until such time as world plan-
ners may want to make some use of
them. One discovery that may be of
special importance in this event is that,
on the Ord, cotton can be “stubbed”
or ratooned with consequent great
savings in land utilisation.
Of the fodder crops tested at the
Kimberley Research Station, sorghum
has been outstanding. Like cotton, this
species can also continue to grow dur-
ing the mild winters and up to three
crops of grain can be harvested within
the one year. Alternatively, the forage
varieties can be cut repeatedly accord-
ing to the current requirement of the
animals for quantity and quality. Total
grain yields of up to 10,000 lb. per acre
have been obtained with triple harvest-
ing, although by the third cycle the
yields are very low. Probably a two-
harvest system would be practised by
commercial farmers. Forage varieties
cut three times have produced some
27,0001 b. of dry matter per acre within
a period of 255 days. Much more re-
search encompassing breeding, fertilisa-
tion, the regeneration processes of
ratoon growth, and planting times and
rates has still to be conducted to ex-
plore fully the potential of sorghum in
the region. The studies to date suggest
that it will prove to be a versatile crop
which will enable productive use to be
made of a corner of earth that previ-
ously promised us little or nothing in
edible form.
Over the past three years, the station
has stepped up its investigations on
wheat and other cereals. Gamenya,
which was bred for the N.S.W.
wheatlands, has produced 70-
bushel crops and the new semi-dwarf
varieties from Mexico have harvested
up to 80 bushels. However, the protein
content and the bread-making quality
of the new varieties are relatively poor.
Since the breeding of wheats specially
capable of appreciating the advantages
of irrigation has been pursued only for
a short time, it is reasonable to expect
that varieties properly adapted to these
conditions will be produced within the
next few years.
In the near future, therefore, the Ord
could become an esteemed granary and
the work presently being done there to
determine sowing times and fertiliser
programs is building a basic fund of
agronomic information that can be
drawn upon when the time comes.
Thus, the studies on rice were termin-
ated some years after knowledge had
advanced to the point where variety
was shown to be the main limiting
factor. These studies are to be renewed
now that the International Rice
Research institute in the Philippines has
achieved a real breakthrough in rice
breeding. The institute’s “miracle”
varieties, as they are popularly called
in some parts of Asia, have the ability
to respond remarkably when given
good conditions for growth. These can
be provided on the Ord.

AN OIL GAMBLE
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS ft OIL TABLE
TAXATION INCENTIVES, it seems,
are not sufficient to lure risk capital
into the search for oil in Australia now
that we have a major producer in the
Gippsland offshore field. That is
implicit in the reaction of the oil-search
financiers to the abolition of the high-
price reward for local oil production.
The taxation incentives minimise, of
course, the degree of capital that is to
be risked. But the lure of the 67 cents
a barrel incentive price for any produc-
tion was great and one which sparked
off a rapid acceleration in the search —
particularly in the more remote, and
therefore more expensive, areas of the
continent.
The Prime Minister, Mr. Gorton,
quite rightly gave the pricing policy
priority over all else. Any further delay ■
in announcing the end of the incentive
pricing scheme would have made it
more difficult to scrub the scheme.
While all oil-prospecting groups were
fully aware that the pricing method
was under review, the 67 cents reward
for every barrel found was a key bait
in the search. Taking the carrot away
after the event would have smacked
of repudiation of a promise.
Mr. Gorton, too, threw a spanner in
the works with his obiter dicta in his
statement on future incentives for oil
search. “Various proposals are under
examination,” he said, “and we will
announce in due course the form of
incentive, if any, which we will adopt.”
(Emphasis ours.) The “if any” addition
was no doubt deliberate, and caused
considerable concern among the pros-
pecting financiers.
It remains that without some con-
siderable form of incentive there is little
profit in looking for oil in Australia’s
remote corners any more. Import-
parity pricing coupled with the high
capital cost of exploration and any
subsequent production facilities coupled
with the additional internal freight
burden make the search unjustified by
the end result. Also, fields discovered
would have to be large to provide an
economic scale now that the additional
67 cents a barrel is abandoned. Granted
that the Government does not want
industry costs to rise just because Aus-
tralia has found oil, any further incen-
tive scheme added to the already liberal
tax concessions granted oil-searching
capital will also involve tax. Possibly
the Prime Minister is thinking of con-
cessions for oil producers in the more
remote areas.
Already one broking house has
delayed flotation of another oil-
prospecting financier, although another,
Genoa, is going ahead. The response on
the share market is clear, too. The
shine has gone well and truly off the
oil gamble.
CHEAP CREDIT
END OF AN ERA
THE GOVERNOR of the Reserve
Bank (Mr. J. G. Phillips) was just as
matter-of-fact as his predecessor, Dr.
Coombs, when he put the screws on the
monetary situation last week. Aimed at
exerting a “cautionary influence to a
developing situation,” Mr. Phillips
called up $57 million of trading-bank
funds and lifted the overdraft rate from
1\ to 1\ percent.
Left unsaid was what was the
developing situation and what, indeed,
was the degree of cautionary influence
being exerted on it? That aside, i the
actions were regarded as the harbinger
of a tight-money era as opposed to the
easy-credit period of the past three
years.
This is not a credit “squeeze” as
such. It merely formally puts an end
to the cheap-credit era. However, it
remains to be seen how a nervous stock
market, with some large calls for capital
coming up, will sustain buoyancy in a
dearer-money climate. Interest rates
will climb further —although the over-
draft rate maximum appears to be
about as high as an overdraft rate ought
to go in what is still basically a sound
economy—when the November Com-
monwealth Loan is announced at the
end of the month.
For, even if the high conversion ele-
ment of 4-| percent stock ($431 million)
is not a factor, then the abolition of
the tax rebate is. Coupon rate may go
as high as 5J percent; that will put a
depressing cover on the equity market
and will certainly put pressure on the
fixed-interest market.
The dearer-money trend, in fact,,
could move sharply up. That might not
be out of order in view of Mr. Phillips’
“developing situation” —which presum-
ably is a strain on resources mainly
because of a national trading account
deficit and an uncertain capital inflow
prospect.
THE CHARTIST SAYS: McDonald INDUSTRIES was recommended
as a recovery situation in February, 1967, at price levels about 49c. Investors
who bought this stock would certainly have shown substantial capital gains,
especially when prices rose to a peak of $l.BO by November, after holding a 200
percent uptrend. The resistance proved too strong at these levels from the area
of trading in 1960-61 and the consolidation pattern now suggests that prices could
fall to approximately 65c-70c, where the situation would again call for reassess-
ment. Last sale price on 10/10/68 —$1.14.
BROKEN HILL SOUTH
TAXATION BARRIER
THE DEMURRER put in the Broken
Hill South accounts last week by
Cooper Brothers, the company’s audi-
tors, was not, of course, one of pro-
priety, say, like the one raised by Reid
Murray’s auditors which took the com-
pany world by storm a few years ago.
Heaven forbid a Collins House co,m-
pany laying themselves open to that.
Nor, to cite a more recent qualification
made to the accounts of Federal Hotels
three years ago, did it involve anything
so serious as a difference of opinion on
the valuation to be put on an asset or
anything that might vitally distort the
accounts.
The issue at stake in the Broken Hill
South affair is simply one of principle
in the method of treating tax allow-
ances whether a company should
take the fullest of accelerated deprecia-
tion allowances as they accrue without
making provision for future years when
allowables would be reduced on account
of the earlier acceleration in them. One
thing is certain about this. You can’t
have your tax cake and eat it or, put
another way, you can’t take your tax
allowances twice. In the event, the B.
H. South board elects to take them

Fritz Klatte discovers plastics
Fritz Klatte discovered "polymerization", the fundamental process in the
production of thermo plastics.
He named his discovery Mowilith (R), a plastics raw material that has been
the basis on which entire industries have grown throughout the world.
Fritz Klatte stands beside Nobel prize winners Robert Koch, Paul Ehrlich,
Emil von Behring and other famous scientists who have enriched the history
of Farbwerke Hoechst AG, now the fourth biggest chemical company in the
world. For many Australians in the past decade, Hoechst ethical pharmaceuti-
cals have meant relief from pain and sickness. For the man on the land,
Hoechst plant protection products and fertilizers have long contributed to better
crops and richer pastures.
Recently, Hoechst has increased its participation in the economic development
of Australia by establishing multi-million dollar plants for the production of
Hostalen (R) high density polyethylene, organic and inorganic pigments and
Mowilith polyvinyl acetate dispersions.
Plans are also well advanced to establish a pharmaceutical products processing
plant in Australia.

today and up to the hilt, whereas
Cooper Brothers maintain that the
right course for the company would
be to make provision for future years
when the allowances would have run
out or, anyway, be lower. Depending on
the course taken, the difference would
be shown up in the accounts to the
extent that profit would be overstated
in the years when tax allowances were
accelerating and be correspondingly
deflated in later years of allowances
deceleration.
This, of course, is an oversimplifica-
tion of the affair because it seems that,
while Broken Hill South has taken
advantage of the maximum tax allow-
ances it was entitled to in line with
the allowed acceleration in depreciation
and amortisation, it has deducted
depreciation and amortisation from its
declared profit for 1967-68 on a
corresponding basis. If this is the case,
then it is hardly a defence of that to
argue that everything will be all right
in a long-term roll-up, that expand-
ing profits from the company’s heavy
development program will take care
of everything. As it is, by following
its own line, the board has come up
with a profit for 1967-68 higher than
the auditors would have done no
small difference, because on the
auditors’ basis instead of profits com-
ing out considerably higher for the
year they would have fallen from
$2,612,000 to $2,451,000.
This raises questions whether a
similar line on tax will be taken by
other Collins House companies, such
as Western Mining Corporation, for
whom Cooper Brothers are also the
auditors. Whatever shareholders may
think of it, it would read rather
strangely to an outside observer after
the bonanza in the shares in the past two
years if WMC as well as Broken Hill
South hadn’t paid any tax to the
Federal Government in the last year.
Equally, in estimating possible future
earning rates of these companies,
allowance would have to be made for
inflated tax bills resulting from the
preferring to pay more tomorrow and
nothing today.
NICKEL
WAY-OUT PHILOSOPHY
THE LITTLE NICKEL - STOCK
philosophy was taken about as far as
it could go in Perth last week when Mr.
Jim Mazza, former chairman of West
Coast Holdings Ltd., said in a television
program that it was on the cards the
company’s shares could increase fifty-
fold. He advocated them as a bottom-
drawer stock that might well prove a
bonanza.
This company has a 211-year option
over nine claims adjacent to the Durkin
Shoot area of Western Mining Corpora-
tion’s tenements. The fiftyfold increase
proposition was put because Mr. Mazza,
like a number of others involved with
the small nickel stocks, maintains that
any kind of discovery by companies
with a small capitalisation would trigger
enough investment to make the shares
react strongly. Moreover, as a former
Kalgoorlie man who helped himself
through his law training by prospecting
for gold (and finding it in big quan-
tities), he believes that the nickel
potential of the Eastern Goldfields
area has hardly been scratched.
In the same program he let drop
that 3.7 percent nickel values had been
encountered north of Leonora at Wil-
dara, an area where Western Mining
Corporation has interests. How is he
able to speak so freely about these
companies? He has resigned from the
West Coast Holdings board so he can
negotiate on behalf of the Boulder
Nickel and Mining Syndicate, of which
he is a member; this syndicate has
optioned its Durkin Shoot tenement to
West Coast Holdings.
OIL EXPLORATION
UNEXCITING WEEK
THERE WERE FEW developments in
the oil-exploration field to capture
speculators’ imaginations last week.
Nine barrels of high-gravity oil
flowed from Esso-BHP’s Flounder A-l,
at 8200 feet, with a relatively high gas-
oil ratio, but the partners said a good
deal of extra work was required to
determine the commercial potential of
this oil zone. Ocean Digger, which
was drilling Flounder, was then moved
to the Snapper A-l well site, for
resumption of drilling there.
A private placement by Clarence
River of a million shares paid to 30c
through a Sydney sharebroker, bring-
ing issued capital to 2.4 million 50c
fully paids and 2.6 million 50c shares
paid to 30c, put $300,000 in kitty for
current drilling program and offshore
activities. After three years of drilling
inaction, the company spudded-in on
the Hogarth Dome near Casino last
Wednesday.
Australian Aquitaine’s Wilson Cliffs
well in Western Australia, in which
Beach has a 15 percent carried interest,
struck minor traces of natural gas, but
no importance is attached to them at
this time. The Associated group plug-
ged the unsuccessful Glentulloch No. 3
well at 3143 feet, and moved the
Emsco rig to Womblebank No. 1.
News of further lost circulation prob-
lems have had little depressant effect
on the already deflated price of Oil
Search shares. It is believed that
Phillips, on neighboring leases, may
soon be able to resume tests on Uramu
No. 1, in Deception Bay.
Adverse weather and mechanical
problems limited Burmah’s Legendre
drilling progress to 181 feet, but the
rig is currently drilling ahead at 9227
feet. Magellan, using the larger rig at
Tyler No. 1, was drilling the Her-
mannsburg sandstone formation at
4350 feet. Wapet’s farmout well, Kemp
Field No. 1, was at 2867 feet.. Rigging
operations were in progress at Mon-
darra No. 1; the Jubilee rig was suc-
cessfully jacked up on the drilling site
at Quinns Rock No. 1, after weeks
of weather-imposed delays.
Abrolhos completed a routine core
on Gun Island No. 1, at 10,764 feet
in shales.
The Bulletin’s table of current and
planned exploratory oil drilling will
appear again next week.
SQUATTING INVESTMENT
PASTORAL POINTERS
IT WAS A MORAL certainty that
pastoral company shares which had
been knocked heavily by the drought
would recover solidly when the long
rains came again (large areas of
former dried-up country in Victoria
have been under wash lately, even
causing the postponement of country
racing in some places) and the
reservoirs filled up again. As a matter
of fact, pastorals have done a great
deal better than mining shares lately
and have shown more resistance to the
easing of industrials in general in the
past month or so. Starting the year at
an average of 118.7 in January, the
index for these shares in Melbourne
climbed to 150 in August and is now
about ten points below that figure
and showing a tendency to improve—
despite the general moaning of farmers’
organisations that economic (if not
seasonal) happenings are hitting them
on every side.
Anyway, the outlook for the rural
industries apparently looks pretty good
to Colonial Mutual Life, which last
week announced it was putting $1
million into Squatting Investment, a
company whose profit experience over
the past ten years has been among the
most erratic of the pastoral companies.
It hasn’t paid a dividend for some
years, 1967 (calendar) being the first
one for a long time it has managed ,to
get its profit head above water with an
earning rate of a mere 4.8 percent.
Because the $1 shares are pretty tightly
held, perhaps, they’ve managed to keep
above par all through the recent profit-
less years. The lowest they’ve touched
in five years is $1.17 three years ago.
The interest now being acquired by
CML would seem to provide a good
pointer to future, prospects for these
shares, which in 1964 got up to $5.20.
The company operates ten “station”
properties, as well as having three
subsidiaries (in one of these, Western
Queensland Pastoral, CML will buy a
one-third interest for $400,000; the

rest of its investment in squatting will

GOOD FOR HAMERSLEY
BUT WATCH THE
IRON-ORE OVERSUPPLY
THE PAST WEEK has seen a
number of significant developments in
the iron ore exploitation and export
industry in Western Australia and has
also brought serious and studied
comment from our largest existing
market and a United Nations agency,
all of which contain food for thought
for the local investing public.
Not the least important of these items
was the statement from the CRA
subsidiary, Hamersley Holdings Ltd.,
of the agreement signed between Han-
wright Iron Mines and itself for the
exploitation of the Paraburdoo iron
ore deposits some 35 miles south of
Hamersley’s Mount Tom Price. In
the terms of the agreement signed
between Hamersley and Messrs.
Hancock and Wright, Hamersley is
committed to the expenditure of a
further $lOO million on the develop-
ment of the Paraburdoo deposit for
direct shipment and also to the
commencement of a vast secondary
processing industry for the production
of metallised agglomerates. This
agreement, which was drawn under the
guidance, and with the concurrence, of
the Western Australian Government,
envisages the transfer of the Paraburdoo
deposit direct to Hamersley in return
for it proceeding forthwith to the con-
struction of a processing plant capable
of producing one million tons of
metallised agglomerates per annum by
1972 and increasing to three million
tons per annum by the end of 1980.
From the text of the Press releases
so far, it appears that all the safe-
guards in the agreement are in favor
of Hamersley and to the detriment of
the Hancock-Wright partnership. It is
worth while enunciating the points
relating to this situation as have been
shown to date, for it clearly demon-
strates the great advantage that a multi-
million dollar, multi-national company
has in negotiations of the kind that
have preceded the formulation of this
agreement:
1. There is no mention of royalties
to the Hanwright partnership such as
they are now receiving from the Mt.
Tom Price exploitation.
2. In the event that Hamersley does

not proceed with the development of
the lease as contained in the original
Hanwright-W.A. Government agree-
ment, then Hanwright must honor its
original commitments, despite the
transfer of the Paraburdoo lease to
Hamersley.
3. Hamersley’s existing commitment
to submit proposals to the Govern-
ment by 1986 for a steelmaking opera-
tion is advanced to 1980, conditional
upon the W.A. Government advising
by 1977 that it will be able to supply
electric power at 0.5 c per unit by
1986.
However, Hamersley, in addition to
its agglomerate plant, must be ready to
produce iron ore from Paraburdoo at
the rate of one million tons per annum
or greater by 1976, and is required to
construct, at its own expense, additional
port facilities to handle this ore together
with the necessary railway link between
the Mt. Tom Price-Dampier railway
and a completely serviced town and
mining plant at Paraburdoo.
To enable this agreement to be
executed, the Western Australian Gov-
ernment is to grant Hamersley a
lease of 50 square miles on the Para-
burdoo reserve. The second part of the
agreement relating to the reshuffling of
the Hanwright leases involves a further
31 leases in the general Wittenoom area
which are to be transferred to a new
company known as the Mt. Bruce
Mining Co. Pty. Ltd., 75 percent owned
by Hamersley and 25 percent owned
by Hanwright Iron Mines. This trans-
fer, and the proposal for its subsequent
development, is very much as envis-
aged in the announcement from the
W.A. Government in March last, when
the leases to Hancock and Wright were
granted.
Perhaps the most significant point
for Hamersley arising out of these
new agreements is not the alteration
in its timetables of developing metallised
agglomerates and the subsequent steel-
making facilities, but the doubling in
one stroke of its reserves of high-grade
haematite. There will also be substantial
benefits in the economies of scale which
can result from the exploitation of the
Paraburdoo deposit and the usage of
the existing railway line and loading
facilities at Dampier.
With capital costs of the first phase
of this agreement being to the order
of $lOO million, it is apparent that both
Hamersley and its parent, CRA, will
need to seek further capital in order
to obtain the gearing basis for additional
borrowings, despite the enormous cash
flow which Hamersley is presently
generating. Drawing a line on the
issue recently announced by RTZ, and
the substantial premium which both
CRA and Hamersley shares enjoy in
the market, a “rights” issue pitched
near the current market would come
as no surprise. In addition, the sweetener
of additional rights being available for
the Australian public to promote Aus-
tralian ownership of its natural and

national resources would take some of
the financial load of RTZ, while only
nominally reducing its equity.
Coincidental with the signing of this
agreement to expand iron-ore produc-
tion in W.A. was the release by the
European Economic Commission of a
study of the prospects for international
trade in iron ore. To Australia’s detri-
ment, the commission warns of a
continuation of the excess productive
capacity throughout the world, prob-
ably until the 1980 s, with continued
low prices. Our principal buyer, Japan,
is using this argument to reinforce
its case for lower prices in the current
round of negotiations being conducted
in Japan on the Robe River iron-ore
offerings and the further contracts which
established producers such as Hamers-
ley and Goldsworthy are seeking to
negotiate.
A lesson can be drawn from the
conclusions reached by the European
Economic Commission study group: “in
view of these facts, decisions on the
expansion of existing mines or the
opening up of new ones must take
into account the probable volume of
future demand . . . and the probable
level of prices. Otherwise, there would
be a risk of wasting capital resources
. . Herein lies the lesson for the
avid expansionists of the Pilbara iron-
ore region, who would sell at any
price, and perhaps also for the Com-
monwealth Government to again review
and consider reintroducing its “guide-
lines” policy.
GENOA OIL
A FARM-IN PARTNER
THE NOVEL FEATURE of the
forthcoming Genoa Oil flotation from
Ord Minnett T. J. Thompson &
Partners is the farming-in by an Austra-
lian company in an off-shore lease held
by overseas companies which are in
the “big league.” It is only in the past
few weeks that we have seen any
response to Mr. Gorton’s call for “part-
nership” in the exploitation of our
resources where the lessees or tenement
holders have been overseas companies.
Previously, the partnerships had all
been in the opposite direction, with the
Australian company searching for a
rich big brother, in almost all instances
an overseas corporation, to help in the
exploration and subsequent exploitation
of the oil tenements.
Genoa is to join with the Phillips,
Canadian Superior, Sunray DX group
in the drilling of an offshore hole in
Permit PE23SH, a permit covering an
area of some 19,000 square miles off the
west coast of Western Australia, oppo-
site Carnarvon, with drilling planned
to commence early in 1969. Intensive
seismic surveys carried out by the tene-
ment-holders have defined three large

of these will be selected for the initial
drilling operation.
With the ratio of success in offshore
drilling considerably lower than the

making a successful debut must be
ranked above average when account is
taken of the area to be tested. PE23SH

A DYNAMIC URGE TO
"THINK PINK" AT
FARLEY AND LEWERS
NOT MANY PUBLIC companies can
boast a doubling of profit in 12
months, but Farley and Lewers Ltd.,
in the toughly competitive businesses
of quarrying and ready-mixed concrete
supply, achieved this in the year to
June, 1968, and earning rate on final
capital increased by a placement, and
a one-for-two bonus was as good as in
the preceding year. Earning rate on
average paid-up capital actually rose
from 23.2 percent in 1967 to 31.2 per-
cent, and on average shareholders’
equity from 10.6 to 14.9 percent,
according to company calculations.
Although 1967-68’s growth was not
just a sudden spurt, for the company
has multiplied net profit five times over
a five-year period, it is unreasonable
to expect it to double again this year.
The profit increase of the last year was
generated partly by four new ready-
mixed concrete companies each operat-
ing one plant, which were taken over in
July, 1967.
The independents, producers who do
not have their own quarry or sandpit,
have been steadily forced out of busi-
ness, or already taken over. There are
now very few companies left to buy in
the ready-mix field, so Farley and
Lewers, now with eight plants, will
have to establish new ones, and these

which attempted to acquire Farley and
Lewers by a cash bid of $1.50 per
share back in June, 1965. To avoid this
fate, Farley and Lewers issued 270,000
shares to an Esso subsidiary (18 percent
of capital then) on the understanding
that Farley and Lewers would have first
option to supply Esso with metal and
sand for its projected hot-mix opera-
tions. Esso obtained approval to set up
a plant in Hornsby, but has not yet
gone ahead. (If Esso took up its entitle-
ment to subsequent issues, its equity
interest would have been whittled to
about 12 percent.) Esso shares ranked
fully for dividend in the past financial
year, but so far the deal has not meant
extra business for Farley and Lewers.
Another important link was forged
when Farley and Lewers issued CSR
with 284,000 shares to acquire a one-
third interest in Nepean River Develop-
ments Pty. Ltd., which owns a sand
and gravel quarry on the Nepean
River. This shareholding represents
about 11 percent of Farley and Lewers’
issued capital, if CSR retained its
bonus scrip. CSR and Blue Metal
Industries are equal owners of Ready
Mixed Concrete, the leader in the
concrete field, and Farley and Lewers
competes with BMI, so this irregular
association isolates Pioneer from the
CSR family of blue-metal and ready-
mixed concrete interests.
The entry to the ready-mixed-
concrete field, with an initial installation
at Brookvale in 1962-63, marked the
beginning of integrated activities which
have captured markets for the com-
pany’s old - established business of
quarrying blue metal, and excavation
■of sand and gravel. ('lt used to be
■engaged in general construction work,
but abandoned this some years ago.)
In 1966, 49 percent of the company’s
total production of coarse and fine
aggregates was used in the ready-mix
division, an internally secured market,
which grew with subsequent acquisi-
tions, so the percentage would be much
greater now.
Farley and Lewers estimate that the
annual growth in the Sydney area,
where it operates (from the Hawkesbury
River in the north, to Sutherland in
the south, and west to the Blue
Mountains) is growing at the rate
■of 7 to 8 percent a year. The company
bas no present intention to move
beyond this area.
Since 1964 the company’s gross
investment in plant and equipment,
vehicles, and furniture has grown from
$1,090,000 to $2,267,000, which after
depreciation has a net book value of
$1,444,000. It spent about $300,000 on
a new secondary crushing and screening
plant at Penrith (which began produc-
tion in October, 1966) to increase
output and significantly reduce costs
of production. Construction has begun
on a new head office in North Sydney,
which will be initially of four storeys,
eventually eight.

have been accumulated over the years,
especially in the Penrith area, for future
development. (In November, 1965, the
company bought from Laurie O’Neil
the business of Riverview Sands Pty.
Ltd., which had valuable freehold sand
deposits close to the Sydney market,
and was well-equipped with modern
plant. It had been a source of supply
to Farl/Cy and Lewers.)
The company rates the principal
factors determining the future as
managerial capacity, modern efficient
equipment, and research and develop-
ment. Only recently the company
established its own research and
development division. Specifications are
increasingly more detailed and more
rigidly enforced, so the division aims
to bring new and better components
to the field of concrete and hot-mix
products.
Creating a brand name by a “Think
Pink” promotion helped materially to
boost sales. Painting the fleet of 150-
odd vehicles pink was part of a
marketing strategy which w r on the com-
pany joint first prize in the 1968
Hoover Marketing Aw’ard.
Premium share placements have been
made over recent years to finance the
purchase of various assets and
organisations, and existing share-
holders, apart from the benefits of a
one-for-tw’o bonus in March of this
year, have been invited to subscribe to
a one-for-ten par issue in October, 1964,
and a one-for-eight par issue in July,
1966.
Tax provided each year approximates
standard tax rates, and there are no
major special items in the accounts to
complicate or qualify the results
declared, except that bad debts written
off or provided did increase from
$41,000 to $78,000 in the past year.
The company has not burdened itself
with heavy external finance. It has
$300,000 in 1\ percent registered
unsecured notes maturing in 1974.
Overdraft fell over the past year from
$473,000 to $255,000.
Trade debtors increased 54 percent
over the past 12 months to $1.2 million,
and indications from the company
were that turnover expanded by more
than this amount.
Dividend of 11 percent after the
bonus in 1968 is equal to 16.5 percent
on pre-bonus capital, compared with
the 15 percent paid in all preceding
years of public history. An early lift
to at least 12 percent would not sur-
prise. Demand for all the group’s pro-
ducts in the September quarter of the
current year rose from the buoyant
levels of the June quarter, and sales
were well in excess of the correspond-
ing period of 1967, so the company is
off to a good start.
The company has shown outstand-
ing dynamism in the past few years,
and, although this rate of development
must taper off, the company is now in
a pretty strong position in the industry.
The shares are currently almost double
their 1968 low, so historically they are
far from cheap, but existing share-
holders may view their investment with
satisfaction, and others may bide their
time for a cheaper entry when the spot-
light has faded from the company.

WARBURTON FRANKI
SWITCHES ON TO
THE SPACE AGE
THE AUSTRALIAN MARKET has
unique tendencies to undervalue shares
it doesn’t understand and to slap, once
and for all, labels on companies. A
few minutes of listening to the “inside”
chatter in the gallery of any exchange
is enough to reveal the straight-out
ignorance, or lack of homework, which
allows these strange attitudes to persist.
A good example of undervaluation
and wrong labelling is Warburton
Franki, a company whose origins go
back to 1903, with official listing dating
from 1921. Because it was once one of
Australia’s largest electrical wholesalers,
the shares have been written down to
yield 6 percent, despite a current net
tangible asset backing of $2.40 and net
earnings of 22 cents per share. The
market has labelled Warburton Franki
“electrical wholesaler” and moved on
to other interests, following the 1963/64
profit slide. In blunt terms, this reason-
ing is cock-eyed. While it can’t be
denied that the company is in electrical
wholesaling in Brisbane, Melbourne,
and Adelaide, with lamps and lighting
equipment also marketed in Sydney,
this activity represents much less than
15 percent of group business. Up to
about five years ago electrical whole-
saling was around half group sales, at
which time the company decided to re-
duce the Sydney set-up to lamps and
lighting and greatly expand other
activities. In fact, profits over the past
three years have almost doubled, due
solely to expansion, although investors
don’t seem to have noticed.
Today, 45 percent of group profit
comes from importing, or acting as
stockist for overseas principals, in
electronic gear for science and industry
and in electrical engineering com-
ponents. The company’s own manu-
factured lines and contracting provide
a little over 40 percent, leaving less than
15 percent for air-conditioning, refrig-
eration, home freezers, and electrical
wholesaling. Warburton Franki’s owa
manufactured lines are equally
balanced, one half comprising switch,
and control gear, and also electrical
contracting, principally in the erection
of power transmission lines and sub-
stations. The other half is in electricity
meters and instruments. The company’s
growth rate in electronics and electrical
engineering (45 percent of group
profit) and in electrical switchgear and
contracting (20 percent) is running at
14 to 15 percent annually. That’s
double the 7 percent annual growth in
Australian electricity consumption,
which seems to make nonsense of the
“electrical wholesaler” label!
Group activities are spread over four
factories—Chatswood (Sydney), Forti-
tude Valley (Brisbane), Kent Town
(Adelaide), and South Melbourne—-pro-
viding employment for 1100. Instru-
ments are made, in Sydney, switchgear
at Brisbane and Adelaide, and com-
mercial refrigerator cabinets are
centred on the South Melbourne plant.
The imminent consolidation of South
Australian activities on a four-acre
complex at Adelaide’s Kidman Park is
expected to give an efficiency boost to-
operations in that State. There are
also distribution points at Newcastle,
Wollongong, Sydney, and Mount Gam-
bier (South Australia) for servicing
sales in electronics, electrical engineer-
ing, and the company’s manufactured
lines.
In electronics and electrical engineer-
ing Warburton Franki holds between
50 and 60 overseas agencies, covering
a wide range of products for what has
become the Space Age industry. The
company draws its switchgear from
Europe, where the voltage is very
similar to Australia’s (unlike the
United States), but electronic equip-
ment is obtained from world leaders
in the U.S.
The group holds strong market posi-


The
Controllers.
How many men are born leaders? Not many. How many of them
also have qualifications and experience which make them stand out as
leaders in their own field? Even fewer. And yet when you’re building a nation
these are the very men you need most.
We’re building a nation in New Guinea. Building it fast—with drive and
vision. To do this we need leaders with drive and vision at the
head of our many development teams.
We’re looking for some of these leaders now. Men who know
how to do things themselves, but also how to get things done through other
people. Creative men who thrive on challenge. They’ll be controlling the
quality of development in some of our most up and coming areas,
so they’ve got to be good.

tions in the manufacture of several
important electrical products. Warbur-
ton Franki is the sole Australian manu-
facturer of ampere-demand meters,
hour meters, and time switches. Ampere-
de,mand meters give a measure of the
maximum current consumed at any
given time, and are used extensively by
major industrial users of electricity,
many of which are billed for electricity
on peak-demand usage in addition to
energy consumption. Hour meters have
wide industrial applications in produc-
tion control, costing, control mainten-
ance, and obsolescence assessment, as
they record the running time of par-
ticular machines. Time switches are
load-control devices designed to turn
power on and off, principally in hot-
water systems. The company controls
50 percent of the Australian market
for time switches, the balance being
provided by imports. Present N.S.W.
moves to replace time switches by
audio-frequency-sensitive relays (cur-
rently imported) will not affect War-
burton Franki, as the group is going
into audio-frequency-relay manufacture
soon, and will be the only Australian
producer.
If this is not a strong enough
product range it should be mentioned
that the company is Australia’s biggest
current and instrument transformer
manufacturer, sole producer of variable
auto-transformers (under licence to
General Radio, U.S.A.), and one of
only three companies in 31mVA-type
tested motor control centres which find
their major outlet in low - voltage
switchboards. The company’s product
is the only one with the advantages of
tested explosion-proof compartments
and withdrawable switch fuse com-
binations, which withdraw with each
individual control centre. It is these
features which led to the company
receiving a contract exceeding $600,000
for low-voltage auxiliaries at the new
Liddell (N.S.W.) power station.
Warburton Franki has a lot in com-
mon with Jacoby Mitchell, a major
competitor in electronic equipment, but
the following figures show the relative
share prices are out of kilter:
Par P/E Yield N.T..A.
Value Ratio % Back. Price
Jacoby Mitchell 50c 9 0 3 8 SI 10 $1 65
Warburton Franki $1 9.0 6.0 $2.40 $2 00
On these figures it seems to me that
Warburton Franki’s shares should be
around $2.50, which would yield 4.8
percent, give a price/earnings ratio of
11.4, and yet be only slightly above
net tangible asset backing. I think this
price can be justified on two grounds:
First, the company has greatly ex-
panded its interests in electronics and
electrical engineering in the past three
years, growing rapidly in these areas.
Secondly, most principal Australian
electronic and electrical stocks would
still be priced higher than a $2.50 War-
burton Franki share, as can be seen

Seven
promising
young
actresses
NOT FOR years has Australia
been populated with so many
generously promising young
actresses as it is at present. For
them, the timing has been right.
If they had embarked on theat-
rical careers a few years before
they did, they might by now he
disillusioned expatriates. Instead,
they are performing a wide
variety of roles through the in-
tensified activities of such com-
panies as the Old Tote, the Mel-
bourne Theatre Company, the
Independent, and the Community.
And although salaries are not yet
all they might be, there is the
opportunity to supplement
theatre appearances with daytime
television jobs. The seven
actresses on these pages are
brightly representative of a young
breed whose names and faces are
becoming attractively familiar to
Australian theatregoers and tele-
vision viewers.
HELEN MORSE (right) gradu-
ated from the National Institute
of Dramatic Art three years ago
with a notable performance in “A
Taste of Honey,” which gave her
career an impetus it has never
lost. She has since appeared in
“Contrabandits,” “Homicide,”
and the “Australian Playhouse”
series, and at the Old Tote and
Independent. She is 21, married
to actor Sandy Harbutt, and has
just appeared in a season of Noel
Coward Festival plays.
MAGGIE MILLAR (left) won Melbourne’s “Erik”
award last year for her performance in “The Heiress.”
After training in Sydney she joined the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust, and then toured Australia and New
Zealand with the Old Vic. She won a scholarship to
the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, graduating with
honors, and an award for the best character per-
formance. She is 27, has just appeared in Melbourne
Theatre Company’s production of “Three Sisters.”
KATE McKITRICK (right) is contracted to the
Community Theatre for most of this year and, at
20, has played parts ranging from a Sunday-school
teacher to an LSD taker. She has done some tele-
vision—“Hunter,” “Homicide,” and “Skippy” episodes
—and has just appeared in “Cannonade of Bells,”
Colin Free’s new Australian play written specially for
the Community. She may also be the only Australian
actress who can play the harp, a talent she hasn’t
yet been called upon to use theatrically.

LYNDELL ROWE (above) has
appeared in numerous TV and
radio plays and has toured with
repertory companies in England
and Australia. She returned from
studying with the Royal Court
Theatre Studio to play in the
Melbourne production of “The
Knack” in 1966. Her latest role
is in the MTC production of
“Three Sisters.” She is 27 and
has ambitions to direct theatre.
KIRRILY NOLAN (above) is one of the most distinctive students to graduate from NIDA
in the last few years. She is 22 and since graduating has worked mainly at the Old
Tote in a broad variety of roles. Her favorites have been the comic Toinette, the maid in
“The Imaginary Invalid,” the peasant woman in Keneally’s “Childermas,” and Regan in
“King Lear,” a part which frustrated her and which she would like to attempt again.
PATRICIA LEEHY (above) drifted into theatre from secon-
dary-school teaching by way of university drama and spare-
time work at the Independent Theatre. She gave up teach-
ing after understudying one of the parts in “The Odd
Couple,” worked for a time in Melbourne TV, then returned
to the Independent for its first six months as a professional
repertory company. She has just advanced her prospects with
stylish performances in the Noel Coward Festival plays.
ROWENA WALLACE (above), at 21, has survived the un-
nerving experience of being labelled “a star overnight” on
the strength of winning a leading role in ATN’s drama series
“You Can’t See Round Corners,” and the even more un-
nerving experience of being in the centre of a censorship
row about a brief love scene in one of its episodes. Once a
weather girl on Brisbane TV, she is now touring with John
McCallum and Googie Withers in “Relatively Speaking.”

THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
Suddenly,
a film
industry—
but where
are
its feet?
By DENIS OBRIEN
Shooting last week of the Goldsworthy production “Color Me Dead,” at Ajax Film
Studios, Bondi ... not high art, but fruitful opportunities
IT ALL seemed too sudden and over-
simplified to comprehend. There we
were, conditioned to a disconsolatory
view of a laboriously convalescing
Australian film industry, when it
erupted in an instancy of health and
booming actuality—“l2 Big Aust. Films
—Govt, steps in,” screeched one of the
Sydney afternoon papers last week.
“Film industry is about to go,” carolled
another sheet. And with Reg Golds-
worthy backslapping his way into the
production of his second Australian-
based movie this year, and minor stars
descending from Hollywood by inter-
national jet, and Charles Higham
keeping “Herald” readers in a simmer-
ing state of agog with extracts from the
daily diary of a film-maker called Sam
Peckinpah (the latest: “The Ballad of
Cable Hogue” has been transferred
from Australia to Arizona because of
the heat of the outback summer!) it
did sound like a symphony for busy
clapperboards.
The catalyst for the confused
excitement was a proclamation by the
New South Wales Government, which
made it clear that it was going to
enforce the Australian quota provisions
of the Cinematograph Films Act of
1935. Of all films acquired by distribu-
tors in N.S.W. every year, three per-
cent must be Australian. The quota
for exhibitors is two-and-a-half percent.
As an average of 400 films are annually
acquired for distribution and exhibited
in N.S.W., there arises a theoretical
need for about 12 Australian films a
year, and that was the figure which
became fuzzily translated into practical
terms. The development was too
surprising and the optimism it spawned
too heady for anyone immediately to
worry about finance, scripts, technicians,
and facilities.
The proclamation was the direct
result of a persuasive lobby by the
Producers and Directors’ Guild of
Australia, a non-profit-making body of
professional practitioners in film and
theatre which was formed in Sydney
in 1963. Since June, the Guild had
been putting the pressure on the N.S.W.
Chief Secretary, Mr. Willis, to give
serious consideration to the “critical
problem of the Australian film
industry,” asking him to increase the
Australian quota system, make sure that
it was enforced, and generally stimulate
film production with such aids as bank
loans, stiffer penalties for quota
defaulters, and the encouragement of
training in film production.
Virtually all Mr. Willis did was to
enforce the provisions of the old Act,
but from a political point of view it
was a good move. It bespoke an
interested concern for the film industry
without spending a cent. And having
put a spine in the Act the Government
has now committed itself to uphold
it.
Just exactly what happens now is
not quite as certain as some of the
excited enthusiasts seem to imagine.
Everyone wants an Australian film
industry, and the current mood of high
head and heart in the right place is
the stuff of sturdy idealism, but some-
one has to put a pair of feet on the
ground.
Movie-making is essentially a com-
mercial venture. It cannot exist alone
on art and the cause of national
identity. The first requirement in
making a film is a script; after that,
money. Both prerequisites seem to have
been hastily overlooked in this new-
style Australian film industry.
The PDGA has claimed that Mr.
Willis’ decision means that if distribu-
tors cannot fill their Australian quota
from existing production sources they
must themselves finance Australian
productions. That is good in theory,
but problematical as a practicality. The
PDGA’s claim that the quota system
for years has been observed in the
breach is disputed by some distributors
and exhibitors. The exhibiting Hoyts
chain, for instance, claims that it more
than met its quota in 1967-68 by
showing 4.1 percent Australian films,
excluding shorts and newsreels.
Says Hoyts’ managing director, Dale
Turnbull: “We, as exhibitors, have
always shown Australian films when
available; we have never shown any
reluctance to screen them. We don’t
put money into the making of films.”
Neither does the PDGA, which sees
itself in a watchdog capacity in the
present developments. PDGA president,
Roland Beckett, himself a film-maker,
says the Guild has been encouraged by
the comparative success of its drive for
a better deal for Australian films, but
is still far from satisfied that enough
is being done to stimulate the industry.
Also, it sees a few holes in the imple-
mentation of the Films Act—most par-
ticularly the fact that it is only enforce-
able in N.S.W. Agitation by film buffs
in other States for similar protection
might confuse the film industry more
than help it.
The important thing is that the
climate for Australian film-making in
Australia suddenly has improved. The
possibility of 12 new films arising as
a direct result of the Act next year is
as remote as the possibility of either
of Reg Goldsworthy’s movies being
hailed as high art, but in both instances
fruitful opportunities have been opened
up.
Meanwhile, international money con-
tinues to dribble into Australia for
solo and co-operative deals which are
arising independent of legislative help
—and Tim Burstall is still in delicate
stages of negotiation for the distribu-
tion of his movie “2000 Weeks,” the
year’s only true all-Australian film.
It is a tender film of considerable
merit and would do much to convince
an Australian public that Australia can
make movies up to an international
standard.


THEATRE/PHILLIP ADAMS
GUILTY OF BOREDOM
The Judge. John Mortimer. St. Mar-
tin’s Theatre, Melbourne.
THERE IS a short story by H. G.
Wells in which the central character
discovers a potion that greatly acceler-
ates the mechanics of his perception.
As a result, the world around him
seems to slow to a snail’s pace, and he
is able to watch in fascinated horror as,
for example, a sneeze grows and ex-
plodes with the slow majesty of a seed-
pod beneath a high-speed scientific
camera. Of course, boredom has much
the same effect on time’s relativity, and
is there anything as boring as a really
bad play? Certainly, while sitting
through “The Judge” as drear a
drama as any I can readily bring to
mind—every moment became elastic-
ised to the limit of endurance and the
final curtain seemed to recede as cruelly
as a particularly tantalising mirage.
This gave one ample time to consider
the imperfections of the production
and, more importantly, the dreadful-
ness of Mortimer’s dialogue.
The play begins with the elderly
Judge arriving in the cathedral town he
hasn’t seen since his childhood. Myster-
iously he has chosen the town for his
last court of assizes. Doubling as chorus,
the Judge gives a little poetic run-
down on the local geography, along
“Our Town” or “Under Milk Wood”
lines, and then proceeds to his resid-
ence. It soon emerges that the old
bloke—a crusty bachelor—is obsessed
by certain nasty happenings in his child-
hood and has returned to see justice
done. In an unguarded moment he talks
of “white legs writhing like worms,” so
one can safely assume that sex is in-
volved somewhere.
Meanwhile we are introduced to an
aging femme fatale called Serena, who
runs the local antique shop and whose
personality provides sufficient glow to
attract a moth-like circle of admirers,
mostly childhood contemporaries of the
be-wigged avenger. The timid bohem-
ianism of Serena’s set —limited to play-
ing parlor games and discussing Cocteau
—has long aroused suspicion and hos-
tility among her neighbors. The Judge
inflames this to such an extent that
soon the local gentry are slinging bricks
at the hapless lady, but rather than
satisfying the tyrannical old goat this
outburst makes him all the more
furious.
The mystery, such as it is, deepens
until at long last the author allows the
penny to drop with a dull thud. The
Judge has returned to the scene of an
adolescent crime so that he himself can
be judged and punished. It seems that
Serena and the Judge were linked, as it
were, by those w r rithing white legs,
and soon His Worship is having an
emotional seizure right in the midst of
her collection of horse brasses, kero
lamps, and cracked Royal Doulton
chamber pots.
Any work so eccentric and affected
thoroughly deserves Irene Mitchell’s
erratic production and the cast’s extra-
ordinary performances. Rolling his eyes
and clutching at his troubled brow,
Norman Kaye plays the Judge with the
silent-movie overstatement of a Mack
Swain, while if you can imagine Lillian
Gish playing Blanche Dubois you’ll get
a fair idea of Leila Blake’s Serena.
Written by an author who was
trained as a barrister, “The Judge” is
guilty on counts of melodrama, deriv-
tiveness, and pretentiousness. First of
all Graham Greene’s tired old “Living
Room” and now this. St. Martin’s next
productions include “Wait Until Dark”
(by the author of “Dial M for
Murder”), “See How They Run,” and
“Charley’s Aunt.” Could it be that the
company’s recent honeymoon with
significant dramatists is over already?
CURRENT IN THE ARENA
HEDONISTS could have it better,
but in Sydney and Melbourne at
present there is a fair sampling of
pleasures available from the performing
arts. Just select your label and pour.
The Melbourne Theatre Company is
performing Edward Albee’s latest,
“Everything In the Garden” (adapted
from Giles Cooper’s original). It’s not
likely to pull as many crowds to Russell
Street as “Three Sisters,” but does have
the Albee cachet. Phillip Adams last
week gave what was for him a rave
notice to the South African revue
“Wait a Minim” (at the Comedy);
John Cargher frothed with enthusiasm
over Igor Moiseyev’s Russian dance
troupe (St. Kilda Plaza), which moves
to Sydney next week. Political picket-
ing hasn’t so far affected its tour. The
Australian Ballet (home in Melbourne)
continues its 1968 season at the Princess
from October 24; a new edition of the
“Black and White Minstrel Show”
began its endless singalong at Her
Majesty’s on October 12, is a safe bet
to be there through Christmas.
Sydney offers “The Boys In the
Band,” Mart Crowley’s razor-tongued
comedy about limp wrists, which has
settled in to buoyant business at the
Playbox. (No, no, Cyril Playbox,
not Gaybox). Impresario Harry M.
Miller, emboldened by the success, now
plans to follow it next year with
“Hair,” which is another theatrical
frontier. Hayes Gordon has hauled his
milkcart back to Her Majesty’s for a
return season of “Fiddler On the Roof.”
The show opened in Sydney 15 months
ago; is the biggest money-spinner for
Williamson’s since “Fair Lady.” The
best legit theatre is at the Old Tote,
where Jim Sharman is staging a
sprightly production of Shaw’s “You
Never Can Tell.” Join the queue to
fall in love with Jacki Weaver. Notable
long-running movies are “In the Heat
of the Night” (eighth month, Mel-
bourne) and “A Man and a Woman”
(ninth month, Sydney), the latter
making an intriguing play for extended
business by offering concessions to
schoolgirls.
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
CRIPPLED RHETORIC
Tango. Slawomir Mrozek. Independent
Theatre, Sydney.
THIS PLAY’S interest lies almost ex-
clusively in its political and social com-
ment, conveyed primarily in a young
intellectual’s extensive and carefully
reasoned arguments and, more success-
fully, in the action within a symbolic
family microcosm. The action alludes
most obviously to developments in
socialism, but is so general in history
that many other parallels from
Napoleon to Mussolini, from “Julius
Caesar” to “Animal Farm” suggest
themselves.
Making no concessions to McLuhan,
“Tango” is wordily rhetorical (Shaw is
alive and hiding in Poland!), and also
casually indebted to the tradition of the
absurd. (“Farce can still be fine art,”
as someone in the play remarks). But
most of all the play is an expression of
the problem of contemporary theatre
—l’m not sure how far Mrozek is con-
scious of this, but the writing seems
crippled by awareness of its purely
academic interest to a world in which
theatre is moribund.
The play enacts major cycles of
political history (revolt, conservative
reaction, emergence, and corruption of
a power figure) in the person of Arthur,
the young intellectual, and his family
circle. He rejects the chaotic life of his
emancipated family unbuttoned,
"artistic” father, free-loving mother,
jockey-capped grandmother and
looks for a way to re-establish a con-
ventional pattern of behaviour.
On its symbolic level the play might
just as well be about the impossibility
of finding a single acceptable artistic
convention and the failure of the
dramatist to create stage life out of
the vacuum in which he finds himself.
One of the characters sums up the
plight of the self-conscious modern
stage: “Tragedy is impossible, farce is
a bore, the only thing left is experi-
ment.”
“Tango” is not, then, by nature,
easy to stage. Director Rick Billing-
hurst ensures that its argument is
clearly developed, but quite often the
writing seems to defy any attempt to
animate it, and the cast is often hard
put to react like human beings to
their various dialectic situations.
Nevertheless, the play held my
attention simply by virtue of its ideas,
and the final image, the tango, is very
impressive.


ART/ELWYN LYNN
THE NEW FAITH
Ron Robertson-Swann. Rudy Ko'mon
Gallery, Sydney.
Wendy Paramor. Central Street
Gallery, Sydney.
IS MR. RUDY KOMON, so often
referred to as a leading dealer, under-
going a conversion, or is he just a little
suspicious that his taste is fossilising?
Next to Alan McCulloch, art critic
of Melbourne’s “Herald,” he is the
most publicly outspoken opponent of
the new abstraction, and twice this year
he has dismissed it for its dependence
on overseas models and for its
inferiority to those models. He con-
demned The Field in toto, but now
he is exhibiting ten paintings and two
large sculptures by Ron Robertson-
Swann who was a pacer in The Field.
If it is a conversion, Mr. Komon has
chosen a reasonably good missionary
who is especially effective with his two
sermons on the new sculpture in
painted steel.
To be fair to Mr. Komon, he has
not been the only prophet of doom
about the new flat abstraction; on a
Melbourne TV station Mr. McCulloch
was joined by Clifton Pugh and
Albert Tucker in castigating the new
ventures, but the trouble is that all
these people have, as it were, invest-
'ments in a form of art that they think
the new faiths may temporarily super-
sede. One of the most frequent
objections is that the new faith is not
indigenous, but some of our young
painters have experienced the genesis
or felt the immediate consequences of
the new art while they have been
abroad in California, New York, and
London. Are they, like Eliot’s Magi,
to return home to feel despised because
they hold alien doctrines? One has had
enough of this myth of indigenous
culture and the rural idiocy it
generates.
Mr. Robertson-Swann, who was born
in Sydney in 1941, studied at the
National Art School in Sydney and left
for Europe in 1960, has studied with
such famous sculptors as Anthony Caro
and Phillip King, and has had most
enviable teaching experience in Eng-
land. His sculpture has some kinship
with Caro’s, and it appears that they
follow parallel courses in producing
painted steel sculpture that lies or thrusts
along the floor rejecting the pedestal,
and is concerned to deny weight,
bulk, and any impression that sculpture
is an outward skin to which internal
forces give a shape. Such sculpture
penetrates, pierces, and partitions space
rather than occupies it; it is the anti-
thesis of sculpture that has, for
example, a central body as a focal point
for various limbs and antennae.
Robertson-Swann’s Transnew field in
sweetest pink, has a curved H-bar of
steel swooping with easy zest on to
two thin sheets of metal set at right
angles to each other and supported by
a curved V-shaped beam. Viewed from
the front it is stillness itself, but from
the side it is an intense confrontation of
gliding movement with sudden obstruc-
tion. Done this year, it is much freer
than his yellow Beethoven of 1963,
which consists of three shapes like
peaked roof-tops of sheds without the
triangular end walls; square sheets of
steel are set diagonally across two of the
sides of the roofs. The general effect
is one of solidity dissolved by the light
that plays around and filters through
the firm shapes. It is an aim he pursues
in, but one of the paintings, Brown
Bomber, where the brown shapes waver
between crimson and indian red bands.
His other paintings consist of triangles
of color, sometimes bitter and bright
and occasionally more subdued, cut into
shape by diagonals of off-white and, in
two cases, by an extra central vertical.
They are as severely simple as this
sounds and, though given playful titles
like Pink Alice, Union Fred, and Union
Henry, they are flags for a land of
bitter joys. What is intriguing about
them is that, despite the rigid white
boundaries, they move with a speed
like that of Transnew field and two
“Transnewfield,” by Robertson-Swann
(each 106 x 20in.) fairly zip along the
walls. Sometimes the scale on which
they depend falters, but in Pink Alice,
where two yellow triangles squeeze two
black ones, the balance is perfect. Yet
when one looks at his sculpture and
recalls Wendy Paramor’s fine pieces in
The Field, one wonders whether the
flat abstractions have secret antipathies
to flatness and whether the best outcome
of the new abstraction will not be
minimal, modular, and painted sculp-
ture.
Miss Paramor is showing no sculpture,
and though her work, except a very
taut yet relaxed Two Plus One, is
finished with less exactitude than
Robertson-Swann’s, she is more daring
in what she attempts a series of
drawn pointed scollops on yellow, a
large naples yellow cross on grey or
white winged shapes, at the top
reflected as purple in the bottom half.
She is after form in movement and
wants forms to repeat themselves like
a marching army where everyone is a
private. The best attempts at such
serialisation are in Manny, where a
series of rectangles with wobbly tops
overlap one another in a diagonal move-
ment, or in Jasper, where “two-dimen-
sional” edges keep swinging two
U-shapes, one above the other, back and
forth. One piece has been done into a
fine tapestry by Margaret Grafton and
indicates what might happen if Miss
Paramor further relaxed her rigid
shapes.
As it is, this looks a transitional exhi-
bition and, in contrast, Robertson-
Swann looks as if he has arrived, but
as Cromwell, a man who could be a
folk hero to the predestined, purist
abstractionist, said in an unorthodox
moment, “He goes furthest who knows
not where he is going.” A good, correc-
tive text for those who want to direct
art history.
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
A YEAR OF QUALITY
OF ALL the entrepreneurs concerned
with serious music in this country the
Musica Viva is the most consistent in
its promotion of quality Imports while
not neglecting our worthwhile indigen-
ous groups. This year’s crop has been
no exception, although many thought
the Bath Ensemble was far from
startling, and I must say I found the
work of the Sydney String Quartet
equally, if not more, rewarding.
Undoubtedly the Viva’s council will
come under attack from the strong
fuddy-duddy elements among the
members over the programs of the
Parrenin Quartet. However, there must
be plenty of subscribers who welcomed
the chance to hear some major con-
temporary works given superlative per-
formances. Schoenberg, Webern, Skal-
kottas, Boulez, and Lutoslawski, all in
two programs at the Sydney Town
Hall, constituted an extraordinary
departure from the basic policy of the
Musica Viva Society, which has been
to present a preponderance of standard
works of the late 18 th and 19th
centuries.
To those who find most contempor-
ary music confusing or difficult, these
two concerts could well have been a
revelation, for the composers’ work
showed an extraordinary range with
markedly different approaches. For me
the biggest names carried the greatest
disappointments; Schoenberg’s Third
Quartet is desperately tedious and the
Livre pour Quatuor of Boulez is pretty
poverty-stricken stuff which even the
authoritative reading by the Parrenins
and the intellectual pretension of the
program notes failed to vitalise.
Although the ten Sketches for Quar-
tet of Skalkottas contain some delici-
ously amusing music, and the fleeting
aphorisms of Webern’s six bagatelles
were as evocative as ever, the most
Impressive piece was the Lutoslawski.
How much of this work had political
undertones it would be hard to say
as it is a very personal document, but
the fragmented desolation of the final
moments was tremendously moving.
Nobody is disconcerted by the widely

differing versions of standard pop
tunes by jazzmen, but in a concert hall
we are still loath to ac'cept a work which
allows excessive freedom in realisation.
Comparing the Parrenins’ version of the
Lutoslawski with the Australian
premiere of this work by the Arthur
Leech Quartet in July this year, there
were times when it appeared to be
another piece; but the overall impact
was remarkably similar. This is high
praise for the Leech players, for the
greater experience of the Parrenins must
have made their task much less formid-
able.
The Parrenins’ dedication to new
music has given them an almost unique
quality as a Quartet; at no ti’me lacking
in ensemble and homogeneity of tone
when such things were required, never-
theless each member can on occasion
cut through with a blazing individu-
ality. It is a pity the main body of
Viva subscribers did not hear these
players in the Debussy Quartet at
Trinity Grammar, where their vitality
etched in the parts with a diamond-
edged clarity. There was little of the
diaphanous and intangible Debussy; it
was music of immense sensibility but
virile and direct.
THEATRE/ROBERT WARD
HIGH FASHION
Enrico IV. Pirandello. Union Hall,
Adelaide.
ROBERT KIMBER’S production for
the Theatre Guild of “Enrico IV” is
very spectacular. The set mixes hot
reds and sombre blues and is domin-
ated by a huge free-form gold throne
above which loom menacing heraldic
shapes. Henry’s servants are dressed
in carefully detailed and colorful
medieval tunics and caps, while he
appears in flowing Byzantine robes.
His friends appear in modern clothes,
the men in lounge suits, the women
less successfully in what are meant to
be haute couture street clothes.
It is one of Pirandello’s master-
pieces, and one is aware on seeing it
how strongly it has influenced, along
with “Six Characters in Search of an
Author,” the course and preoccupa-
tions of modern European drama.
Robert Kimber’s direction displays his
understanding of the play, its argu-
ment and its drama, and his cast
interprets these with remarkable con-
trol, discipline, and sense of style.
Central to the success of the pro-
duction is Wayne Anthoney, whose
Henry is one of the year’s outstanding
performances. His initial slightly lisp-
ing and feverish manner modifies as
the play progresses and ends in the
last scene on a note of pathetic, child-
like resignation. Tall, nervous, drawn,
and staring, in performance he re-
minds one of an El Greco saint; the
same balance, fluid line, tension, and
sad helplessness.

WAITING FOR WORDS
AS FANTASY, the Great Unwritten
Australian Novel has long been over-
taken by the Great Unwritten Austra-
lian Opera. The need for an indigenous
opera arose when it became clear that
the Sydney Opera House could hardly
open with anything less than a local
work; the Monster Concert first talked
about would hardly do.
There is no shortage of suitable
composers, although Peter Sculthorpe
is the name most often mentioned.
Recently the Sydney Opera House
Trust woke from its deep sleep to
commission an opera from Malcolm
Williamson. The difficulty has been to
find a librettist. At one time Patrick
White was approached. Alan Moore-
head, with typical thoroughness, paced
out the main stage of the unfinished
building but took few further steps.
Now Hal Porter mentions that he was
approached by Claude Alcorso, an
enthusiastic and enterprising member
of the Elizabethan Trust board, to see
if he would like to have a shot.
LAUGHING ECHOES
EVER since the American TV comedy
show “Laugh In” entered the Austra-
lian program lists we have been waiting
for the derivative minds of Australian
television to begin clicking in the same
style and tempo. Last week, “TV
Times” reported that ATN7’s replace-
ment for “The Mavis Bramston Show”
was due to air soon and that “in some
respects it would be similar to ‘Laugh
In’.” Imitation is the sincerest form of
commercial expediency in television,
but if the Channel 7 people ran
through some of their old “Revue ’61”
and “Revue ’62” videotapes they would
find the originals of much of the
material that Digby Wolfe and Chris
Beard have contributed to “Laugh In.”
Somewhere in it all there’s a hollow
laugh.
MR. HALL'S FESTIVAL HALL
AT LAST Adelaide’s long-projected
Festival Hall is at the stage of decision.
South Australian Premier Mr. Hall
has rejected the Dunstan Government’s
proposal for a site at the back of
Government House and has accepted
a committee’s recommendation for a
site in Elder Park bounded on one side
by Torrens Lake and on the others
by King William Road, Parliament
House, and the railway station. Last
week, with the committee’s report
released and suggesting that if work on
the site starts next March the hall
should be available for the 1972 Festi-
val, the plan received rapid Cabinet
and City Council support.
The hall is to be simply that —not
ythe originally proposed performing
arts complex—and is estimated to cost
about $4J million. Space is to be
provided for a performing arts centre in
the unspecified future. At this point,
critics of the new plan will quickly
remark that the complex proposed by
the previous Government’s theatre con-
sultants would have been built for $4.8
million on Crown land.
FILMS FOR THE ASIANS
THE AMOUNT of Australian indus-
triousness behind the business of mak-
ing films continues to impress us. We
were particularly interested to hear
from Hong Kong last week that one
Terry Bourke, 27, of Bairnsdale, Vic-
toria, has just completed a Mandarin
language drama called “Sampan” and
now has been offered American back-
ing of $4 million to make six more
films in Asia. Come home, Mr. Bourke.
Australia needs you.
READ ALL ABOUT IT
WITHIN 24 hours of the death last
week in Goulburn Jail of kidnapper
Stephen Bradley, Sydney’s heavy-
breathing afternoon paper, the
“Mirror,” was huffing into print with
hobnail journalism about the horrors of
the Graeme Thorne murder in 1960.
“Bazil Thorne’s sadness is still evident
eight years after the event,” reported
the “Mirror” in 10-point Solemn.
“Like his wife, he can only repeat over
and over: ‘Please God, why can’t we
forget? It’s all over now . . . please let
us forget’.” The “Mirror” heard him
but didn’t heed him. On the same page
it was busy baiting its readers with,
“Begins tomorrow: Full story of the
kidnap-killing.”
A CAST OF THOUSANDS
PUBLICATION IS due next month of
the 19th triennial edition of that
weighty reference volume “Who’s Who
in Australia.” Edited by J. A. Alex-
ander and published by the Melbourne
“Herald,” it is a project that publishers
dream about —a book with a ready-
made market. In addition to publishing
a work that any library of standing
virtually is obliged to carry, the
“Herald” has offered the book at a
special pre-publication price of $13.50
to people whose biographies appear in
it. As the last edition contained 951
pages each carrying 10-12 biographies,
this would appear to provide a con-
siderable field of potential customers.
When published, the book will sell at
a retail price of $15.50; a trade discount
of 25 percent means that the publishers
can make more profit per copy on their
special pre-publication offer than they
can on the open market.

Andy. Geoffrey Dutton. Collins. $3.60.
HERE IS Geoffrey Dutton’s second

it was never reprinted, and why
Dutton did not attempt the genre
again. Even so, I was unprepared for
“Andy” a huge breath of air of a

funny with depths of pathos, pity, and
tragedy beneath its cojnicality
Chaplinesque.
To doubt whether “Andy” would
have been written in quite the same
way had it not been for “Catch 22”
is not to denigrate the book, whose
pages are not even “Catch 22” trans-
lated into Australian terms but, in its
best parts, something quite different.
The debts are more directly apparent
in the least good parts, especially
some of Part 3.
Andy is a superb pilot whose pre-
war career in the permanent RAAF
was terminated, just before he gradua-
ted as an officer, by one of his spells
in “boob.” As the book opens he is
enduring another, this time as a mem-
ber of the wartime Air Force. Andy is
no ordinary criminal, service or other-
wise. It is impossible to describe, briefly
and after such recent exposure to
him, precisely what he is. He is, for
one thing, a sort of quintessential
spirit of all daring and irresponsible
boys and young men, especially those
of his (and my) wartime vintage.
Some of the book’s episodes, like the
“burial” of Squadron-Leader Snyder,
circulated in the folklore of those
times, and whether things like this
really happened matters nothing it
is their bitter-joyous incorporation in
this book which counts.
Andy is brave daredevil might
be a better word. He is these things
because he is skilful and can make
flying machines do what he wishes
other of his friends come to grief
In attempting to emulate Andy. If
you belong to the “death wish” school
you will find Andy’s clearly stated
here. Since his quest for freedom
usually ends in his confinement, he
realises, “But death would be the only
perfect freedom. And danger the true
taste of it.”
Andy is sexually promiscuous and
widely successful. His insouciant en-
joyment of a bit of “nest” again
allows many of his adventures to in-
corporate the folklore of his terms
the Felicitys and Pats of the book
figured (with variations) in delicious
tales which titillated Sydney during
the war their exploits need not be
true but gain no hearing if they do
not seem true. They seem true enough
here.
Andy is resourceful and never more
so than when undergoing detention
the opening chapters, in prison, dis-
play him superbly. He is, in short, a
Puck figure about whom a whole
Australian era is made to revolve with
its history, art, ideas, personalities,
and rackets and and this is one of
Dutton’s best achievements, its sound
the cadence and essence of its
tough, slangy, pre-TV Australian
speech.
Yet the humor of the book is so
cumulative that it is impossible to con-
vey by quotation. Andy’s cars, his petrol
wanglings, his tomato sandwiches, his
brushes with authority, his dreadful
contacts with Vince-Merv, his long
friendships with, and ascendancy over
lan Almond, the historian and pilot
who becomes as drunk as his com-
panions when waterlogged with inter-
minable lemonade—all these matters
become increasingly and overwhelm-
Dutton ...cumulative humor
ingly funny, but only as one reads. And
depths underly always; in Ulrica the
refugee girl, in Masters a fascist-min-
ded American, in the Animal who is
a marvellous painter, in the very fabric
of the tale.
The book is not entirely successful.
Twice Dutton, or so it seems to me,
allows it to depart from its character
and to become temporarily another
kind of work—and a different kind
both times. The first departure is the
party at Mincing Doo. Those parts of
this chapter which present Lady
Broughton, a dreadful hostess, simply
do not match with most of “Andy”
(although her children do), though,
like everything else here, Lady B.
existed—and still does. Then at the end
“Andy” deviates again.
The vulgarity of the Porna Island
section seems to me quite out of keep-
ing with the joyous bawdiness which
preceded it and the deep, nearly sen-
timental seriousness of the episode
where Andy, ferrying a Japanese officer,
crashes his plane, seems quite out of
accord with the treatment of equally
profound material earlier.
For the philosophy of John Lydford,
the eccentric owner of a Tasmanian
ancestral mansion called Hangingstone,
is quite as basic, and as shocking in the
sense of shocking a reader into aware-
ness, as is the philosophy of Kano,
the Japanese. Certainly the conclusion
does tie up all threads, and does dis-
close the functions of various repetitive
symbols and symbolic occurrences
which have introduced before, but its
manner and treatment are awry. Even
its defects, however, cannot destroy the
exhilaration of reading “Andy.”
NOT SO SHREWD
By ANDREW FABINYI
Boomerang. George Mikes. Andre
Deutsch. $2.55.
I READ George Mikes’ “How to be
an Alien,” that gentle spoof, his first
book in English, at the time when we
had both become ex-Hungarians. I
have remained, if not necessarily his
fan, his follower ever since. I have seen
him develop his own special genre of
travelogue: the quick but unhurried
look the picking up of anecdote and
gossip the amiable chats with a non-
cross-section of a particular community
the light sketch of physical sur-
roundings all professionally pack-
aged in non-offensive satire and decor-
ated with an occasional vivid flash of
a brilliant verbal joke.
But as the years, on the whole
unpleasant years, rolled by, Mikes had
begun to share the fate of most humor-
ists, to become progressively more and
more serious. After 1956 he wrote an
impassioned book on the Hungarian
revolution; he then turned, with indif-
ferent success, to novel-writing. But his
bread and butter remained travel, and
after a visit to the West Indies,
enshrined in his “Not by Sun Alone,”
he duly arrived in Australia in 1967.
He came here still a humorist, but
already shedding the mantle of the
“shrewd, casual observer,” and setting
about to acquire the pretence, if not
the tools, of the sociologist. The book
recording his visit is puzzlingly sub-
titled “Australia Rediscovered.” Mikes
himself has not been here before and
it is not clear whether his rediscovery
purports to complete jobs left unfin-
ished by Cook or Flinders, or social
assessments by Trollope or such con-
temporaries as J. D. Pringle, Robin
Boyd, Donald Horne, or Craig
McGregor.
Mikes says that he is writing his
book “about Australians and not for
Australians,” and he is, therefore,
entitled to spread thinly over the chap-
ters some elementary, sixth-grade-social-
studies-level stuff about population,
distances, compulsory voting, and so
forth. He goes on to say that he did not
care a hoot whether we liked his views


but expressed the fear that his book
would arouse “not too much contro-
versy but too little.”
And indeed it is difficult to whip up
the mood of controversy or indignant
anger with such an amiable visitor as
George Mikes. One just has a friendly
smile for such findings as that at the
apex of Australian society are still the
men who see themselves as “patrician
Englishmen with stiff upper lips,
devoted to huntin’, shootin’ and
fishin’.” Whatever else we may read in
the society columns about the doings
of our socialites, it would not be an
account of a wallaby hunt or deer-
stalking, and Australian fishin’ surely
belongs to the class of which John
O’Grady is the rapporteur.
Neither will our tempers rise by the
account of his encounters with wait-
resses and waiters, who are, according
to Mikes, either unaware of the color
of an espresso or who (a unique and
significant experience, which most of us
have so far succeeded in avoiding)
bring the meat course before the soup.
All this is related to Australians being
humorless. Generally, but particularly
in restaurants grappling with unskilled
waiters, they appear sullen and morose.
They are, or some of them are, “so
unfriendly and sulky in the bargain.”
All this because Australians, says
Mikes, are “beginners.”
They are also still in the throes of a
“provincialism which dies hard.” He
was in Australia during the Six-Day
War and found that some newspapers
treated war news as of secondary impor-
tance. By this he must mean that after
giving the front-page headlines to the
Middle East, the newspapers, as papers
no doubt did in the rest of the world,
continued to report local news as well.
A promising chapter-head is his “The
Sad Decline of Ariti-intellectualism.” It
starts with the proposition that Aus-
tralia is one of the few anti-intellectual
countries, compared with the many
which are simply non-intellectual; the
differentiation, if I may say so, is
somewhat imprecise. Be that as it may,
“The Art of Conversation” says
Mikes —“could not die in Australia, (is
there an assumption that it died else-
where?); it never lived.” What on
earth does Mikes mean by “Art of
Conversation”? Does he mean that
Sydney taxi-drivers are less voluble
than those in Liverpool? Did he com-
pare the yarns of an Alan Marshall or
Frank Hardy with the drunken mut-
terings one hears in a New York bar?
Did he find that dons in Adelaide
are less grammatical than dons in
Cambridge? Did he make a com-
parative analysis between the dinner-
table conversation (or silence) of
a dock-worker in London’s East End
and a wharfie in Melbourne? Did he
find the innumerable businessmen, poli-
ticians, publishers, journalists, public
servants he talked to completely inar-
ticulate? Or did he, heaven forbid, find
that the Hungarian spoken in Sydney
less fluent since it has been transferred
from the banks of the Danube?
Mikes then does admit, quite gener-
ously, I thought, that, of course, Aus-
tralia has a number of outstanding
intellectuals, but they are few and far
between. Are they fewer per head in
Paddington or East Melbourne than
they are in Bloomsbury or Hampstead?
They are, Mikes said, “regarded with
grave suspicion.” With graver suspicion
than they are regarded, say, in Portugal
in Communist countries in South
Africa or by George Wallace of
Alabama?
But according to Mikes there is a
saving grace. With the first reverbera-
ting student row (would Monash meet
the case?) Australia will realise that
it is “no longer a teenager, it had just
started to grow up intellectually.”
New Australians, a description Mikes
thoroughly disapproves of, the new
Australia which has absorbed and is
anxious to absorb more migrants from
Europe, is understandably an under-
lying pre-occupation of his book. He
has some pertinent, if superficial,
remarks to make about integration,
language, migrant hostels, and the
larger problems, in the case of non-
British migrants, of the second genera-
tion double life.
He is on his home ground when con-
fronted with Hungarians, who, he says
with kindly disparagement, become, as
soon as they are allowed to, more fervid
Australians than the Australians them-
selves. They resented his critical (?)
inquiries most, tried to sell him cheap
propaganda. They adore Australia but,
and here is the rub, they despise Aus-
tralians. He quotes a remark: “They—
the Australians are condescending
nowadays and accept us Hungarians
and our friendship, but I am not
impressed. Most of them—Australians
are dull, uneducated, narrow-
minded, and unless you booze with
them you have nothing in common
with them.”
What a fundamentalist, almost child-
ish assessment this is of a fascinating
social integration process which, at its
worst, could only be described as com-
plex. But it is at par with Mikes’ own
flippantly cynical finding that “Hun-
garians form not only a local clique”—
this half-truth refers, admittedly, to
Sydney and is not even a quarter-truth
in other places—“but also a world-wide
conspiracy, third in importance only to
homosexuals and Roman Catholics!”
“Boomerang” is a readable, good-
value book of quite significant unim-
portance. Here and there the well-
turned-out phrases show flashes of per-
ception, and those who never think
(the majority, according to Mikes),
might perhaps begin to do so as a
bonus of the light entertainment
derived from the book. But it does not
throw up anything new or startling
either about Australians, or ex-
Hungarians, one of whom wrote the
book, one who published it, one who
illustrated it (George Molnar’s illus-
trations are splendid, but it is a pity
that the captions are Mikes’ and not
his), and one who has now reviewed
it.
FUN IN THE JUNGLE
By FRANK ROBERTS
The London Jungle Adventures of
Charlie Hope. Morris Lurie. Hodder
and Stoughton. $3.25.
EXPATRIATE Australian Morris
Lurie must be one of the most promis-
ing humorous writers alive, and he is
only 30. His style, a bit like Mordecai
Richler’s, comes from the same fount
of Jewish humor, with a deadly eye
and ear for the foibles of humanity.
His first novel, “Rappaport,” was
widely acclaimed; this second one is
the clincher. Lurie is good.
It’s about Charlie Hope from Mel-
bourne, art director in a London adver-
tising agency, inventive (but talentless)
designer, investor in strange businesses
which never pay off, buyer of fake Old
Masters and brand-new junk, hooked
on England and increasingly scared
as his self-inflicted troubles pyramid and
that fatal hour draws nearer of
having to return to Australia.
It’s non-stop comedy from the open-
ing curtain: “The telephone is ring-
ing. The baby is crying. There’s some-
one at the front door. Ella Fitzgerald
is singing ‘lt’s Too Darn Hot.’ Round
she spins on a battered plastic record-
Lurie...crackling modern idiom
player strewn on the floor, her lilting
voice chased by a bouncing big band.
‘Oh!’ comes from behind a bamboo
screen. Golden-fresh corn on the cob
is being consumed in the kitchen (where
a radio is playing) by a bearded artist
and a thin businessman in a black suit.
Ring, ring goes the doorbell. The cats
are fighting. ‘Jeezus!’ cries Hope,
standing before me . . .”
The cast of weirdos, as seen by
Charlie’s erstwhile gym mate Nathan
Fine, seems endless, and each is worth
the admission price. McNully, the
Grand Prix mechanic who has reduced
Charlie’s Sunbeam Talbot to its com-
ponents, never to be put together again,
goes out to look for a room. “Mad
are his staring eyes under his greasy
black beret, and where does there exist
a landlady foolish enough to open her
doors to such a man?” Charlie’s father-
in-law, Mr. St. John, meets his grand-
son: “Mr. St. John is a breeder of

racehorses, and I get the feeling that
he is inspecting Percival for hurdling
potential, examining his teeth, making
mental note of how high his grandson
stands in hands. Will he, I wonder,
exclaim, ‘Jolly topping!’? ‘Splendid!’
he says.”
Fine, the narrator, as much a charac-
ter of the book as Charlie Hope, is
visible in the interstices, where his past
and present are often seen at the same
time. Through him, Lurie is also able
to catch the feelings of being alive at
certain times in certain places, so very
well. There is a Tangier interlude; a
London moment: “Christmas morning,
waking at ten with cold feet and the
rub of bristles on my chin. A pattern
of bleak branches on the blind. I try
to sleep some more but it’s no use.
Too cold. So I put my cold feet into
cold , shoes and attempt my Canadian
exercises, but the bones are too brittle.
Can’t touch the toes. Might break in
half.”
But Charlie Hope, with his “What’s
new?” and his “Yeah” when asked
awkward questions; poor, hopeless,
netted-fish Charlie and his thrashings,
are the frame from which the narrator
and all other characters are dependent.
At the one time, the novel is a study
of an incipient spiv’s flowering, a good-
hearted bloke’s self-betrayal; of Austra-
lians in London and the extremes of
their feelings about London; and all
done with a sure touch, an enviable
crackling use of modern idiom and
mechanics. As someone said of Lurie’s
first novel, “I would buy his next book
the day it appeared.” It cannot be too
soon.
PRO- OR ANTI-JEWISH?
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
The Merciful Jew. Catherine Storr.
Barrie-Cresset. $2.50.
THE GENTLEMAN named above
appears in one of the oddest books
this reviewer has ever come across, for
reasons which it is not so easy to
pin down immediately on paper. It
seems analogous to that familiar type
of racialist statement which runs:
“But all my best friends are Jews!”
or “I certainly have no color prejudice
but . . .” One cannot help suspecting
that the overall impression with which
one may be left is not at all what
the author had intended.
The novel, which was obviously in-
spired by the Eichmann affair, pur-
ports to deal with Jewish victims of
Nazi persecution and their supposed
self-appointed .mission to track down
every remaining criminal who had
committed organised atrocities in
Hitler’s death and torture chambers.
The titular central character, the once-
gay young Viennese Jew, Stefan
Mannheim, whose promising musical
career was ruined by a Nazi-inflicted
mutilation of the left hand, turns up
in present-day London, as an old, ill,
disillusioned American national, on the
track of the notorious medical vivi-
sectionist Dr. Wiedner. Stefan’s orders
are to bring the doctor back alive to
Israel for trial.
The main premise of this pre-
fabricated story is a completely false
supposition stated in the book as if
actual fact that every victim of Nazi
persecution belongs to some Mafia-like
underground organisation bent on col-
lective vengeance. It smacks too much
of that old bogyman, the Jewish world
conspiracy.
It is possible that some such society
as Miss Storr’s “Leonora Bund,” which
takes its na’me from the heroine in
Beethoven’s opera “Fidelio,” really does
exist in some form. The author should
have let it go at that. However, she
continues, “There were many after the
war. This one began in Vienna . . .
everyone joined one or another . . .
this organisation is all over the world.
So many Jews, it would make you anti-
Semite only to think of them . .
Exactly. This is the crucial point. It
is just this almost subliminal essence
of unintentional anti-Semitism that this
reviewer finds so disturbing. It is the
more dangerous because it works like a
hidden undertow, pulling beneath the
apparently unbiased, almost sympa-
thetic, even pro-Jewish surface.
Stefan is “merciful” only if one con-
cedes that this is the right word for
shooting a Nazi dead on the spot as
an alternative to putting him on
trial alive. Stefan himself, due to
die of cancer in a few weeks any-
way, has discovered his quarry, per-
fectly disguised as a Jew through
plastic surgery (“a curved, high-
bridged nose and full lips”), colored
contact lenses, and circumcision,
practising in Wimpole Street as Dr.
Goldman, one of his owi dead victims.
The reader is allowed to meet
Wiedner-Goldman all too briefly and
inconclusively in his new role as “Jew,”'
never in his old one as Nazi. Instead,
another biased slant, he is shown only
as personified through his charming,
innocent daughter Resi, who, coinci-
dentally, had had a youthful love affair
with Stefan back in pre-Anschluss
Vienna, and on whose account Stefan
is now supposed to exercise his mercy.
Credulity is stretched to the limit by
making the narrator a non-Jewish
London housewife, a former friend of
both Resi and Stefan, to whom the
“Leonora Bund” come for help in
tracking down Dr. Wiedner. Not . . .
likely! However, the writing is at its
most convincing when it deals with this
Englishwoman’s own uneventful house-
wifery, her own vague frustrations, her
own not very contented marriage to an
unemotional acade’mic medico, and her
own and her young daughter’s short-
lived crushes on Stefan’s personable
male companion. But the two parts of
the work, the real world and the night-
mare, never succeed in coming
together. It is Catherine Storr’s first
novel.

Rational immigration
The N.S.W. Association for Immi-
gration Reform wholeheartedly endorses
your tribute to the speech by Mr.
E. St. John, MP, during the debate on
the Immigration estimates. We must
point out, however, that his opinion
that about 1000 non-Europeans acquire
the right to settle annually is nearer
the truth than you suggest (8., Oct. 5).
You rightly say that according to
the latest departmental estimate 1475
non-Europeans (other than relatives of
persons already here) have been
allowed to immigrate since the policy
change of March, 1966. You then treat
the 1475 as though they were all bread-
winners, and after allowing for depend-
ants you estimate the total inflow from
this source at “something 'more than
2000 a year.”
However, according to a phone con-
versation we recently held with
the Immigration Department, the
figure of 1475 includes dependants. So
you are allowing for them. twice over.
A rational policy is a little further off
than your otherwise helpful comment
implies.

If your writer is to be taken seri-

Taxes
Readers of The Bulletin should be
much indebted to a former editor,
Peter Coleman, for his informative and
instructive article on the financial
relations between the Commonwealth
and the States —“The View from Mac-
quarie Street” (8., Oct. 5). It will be
news to many people that in Canada
the Provinces levy their own income
tax, yet only one income-tax-return
form is used and the National Govern-
ment collects all income tax, returning
to each Province what each has levied.
The important principle is that a
Province is responsible for levying all
the taxes for all the money which it
spends, and not merely part of it as
is the case of the States in Australia.
In the archives at Ash Street there
should be a copy of a report by a
Liberal Party sub-committee on con-
stitutional matters of which I was a
member over 15 years ago. One of my
recommendations was that “uniform”
taxation should be retained, but each
Federal income-tax assessment should
carry a surcharge which would vary
from State to State, being the amount
which each particular State required
from each taxpayer to supplement its
revenue from the usual State taxes.
