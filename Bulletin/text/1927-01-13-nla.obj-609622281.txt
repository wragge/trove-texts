THE more beautiful a -woman is the greater her dread of old age.
' Woman, by her beauty alone, has ruled and ruined nations,
made and unmade kingdoms, suppressed and caused revolutions—
such is the power of her beauty.
Beauty and Youth go hand in hand. As old age appears beauty
gradually fades, the skin loses its peach-like bloom, and, worst of
all, the telltale of approaching years, silvery GREY HAIRS, make
their appearance. As soon as a woman sees the reflection of these
silver threads in her mirror she realises her maturing years. Her
husband, her children and her friends—they all notice it.
ALIjEN’S WALNUT STAIN is a simple, harmless liquid, and
when applied to the hair removes these telltale silver threads.
Obtainable in brown or black, it tints to any, shade. It is
perfectly safe and easy to apply, and can be obtained from any
chemist or store, price 4/-, or from the Agents, Messrs. Muir & Neil,

The Genesis of Advertisement
[From the Dutch of “Multatuli.”]
Ilassan sold dates in the streets of Damas-
cus. When I say lie sold them, I really
mean that he did not sell them, for his
dates were so small that no one would buy
them.
He saw with regret and envy how every-
one patronised his rich rival Aouled, who
lived next door to him on a mat. For they
lived on mats in Damascus, with very high
awnings, since they had no roof over
them. The wealth of Aouled did not con-
sist in houses, but in a garden which was
very fertile, so fertile that the dates which
grew there were as large as three ordinary
dates. So the passers-by bought the dates
of Aouled, and not the dates of Hassan.
Now there came to Hassan a dervish
who had wisdom to spare, but was short of
food.
“Give me something to eat,” commanded
the dervish; “then I shall do for you what
no klialif can do. I shall compel the people
to buy your dates by making them large,
even larger than the fruits of Aouled. What
size are they?”
“Alas, O Dervish, sent by Allah—l kiss
thy feet—the dates of Aouled (may Allah
give him cramps!) are three times as large
as ordinary dates! Come inside upon my
mat, cross thy legs, be blessed, and teach
me how to make my dates large and how
to force the people to buy them.”
Hassan placed cooked leather before his
guest, which was all that was left of a
stolen he-goat.
The dervish ate till he was satisfied, and
spoke:
“Three times as large as ordinary dates
are the fruits of your neighbor. What
size do you wish yours to become, O Hassan,
son of I know not whom?”
Hassan thought a moment, then said :
“May Allah give thee children and cattle!
I wish my dates to be three times as large
as you can make them.”
“Very good,” said the dervish. Here is
a bird that I have brought from the Far
East. Tell him that each of your dates is
as large as three of your dates.”
“I wish thee wives and camels, O Dervish,
who smellest pleasant as olives. But what
boots it if I tell this bird that which is
not?”
“Do according to my words,” replied the
wise man. “I am a dervish ; do not expect to
understand me!”
Hassan wished the bird length of feathers,
and called him “Roc.” But he was no
roc. He was a little bird that slightly
resembled a raven, with a nimble tongue and
a skipping step. The dervish had brought
him from Sumatra, where he had been
imported by merchants who had come over-
sea from the laud where the people resemble
negroes, although it is far from Africa. The
reason why Hassan called him Roc was that
he, Hassan, had noticed that people whom
you ask for anything swell, and vice versa
he that wants anything from another shrinks.
So it was in Damascus.
Hassan shrank and said : “I am thy slave,
O Roc! My father was a d0g.... and each
of my dates is as large as three of my
dates!”
“That’s right,” said the dervish. “Go
on like this, and fear Allah!”
Hassan went on like that. He feared
Allah, and kept telling the bird that his
dates “are three times as large as they
are.”
The reward of virtue did not fail to
come. Not three times, yet had the klialif
had all the female occupants of his. harem
killed ; not yet had any mother had time to
make her daughters look pretty for the
market at Stamboul; not yet one single
strayed he-goat had Hassan met to keep
him alive-on his mat, when the bird called
out:
“My father is a d0g”....
This was not necessary, but he repeated
it after Hassan.
“My father is a dog; be blessed with
length of feathers; the dates of Hassan
are three times as large as they are!”
There were wiseacres in Damascus who
contradicted this. But it did not last long.
For there was in the voice of the bird a
something that made the air vibrate in a
njanndr that influenced the refraction of
light. The dates grew, grew, grew in the
sight of everyone!
And still the bird kept, calling: “The dates
of Hassan are three times as large as they
are!”
And still they grew. People over-strained
their wide-open mouths in biting- them.
Aouled grew very thin. But Hassan
bought many he-goats and lambs, and he
built a roof over his mat. He became verv
honest, and thought it a shame if anyone
who _ had no lambs of his own ate one
of , A V- he con tinued to fear Allah.
And all his piety and wealth he owed to
the little bird wh-icli for ever said the same
thing, and which made truth out of untruth
by iteration. And everyone thought Has-
san s dates large, everyone was compelled
to buy them, everyone
Except Hassan himself, who secretly
obtained his supplies from Aouled, whose
only customer he was.
And it has been thus unto this day.
W. SIEBENHAAR.
The Journalist as Novelist
The recent death of the journalist-novelist
W. L. George draws attention to the fact
that of the great number of modern novelists
who were hatched in the newspaper world
few have managed to get into the first rank.
Neither Galsworthy, Hardy. Conrad. George
Moore, E. M. Forster nor May Sinclair
began as journalists; nor did Conan Doyle,
Somerset Maugham or Sheila Kayo-Smith.
The only men whom the journalists can put
against these are 11. G. Wells, Arnold
Bennett, Chesterton. Belloc and Compton
Mackenzie, a quintette which presumably
most critics would agree in placing at the head
of a list of journalists which includes Gilbert
Canaan. ,T. D. Beresford, Stephen Gwynn,
Arthur Machen, Thomas Burke, Algernon
Blackwood, Philip Gibbs, Douglas Goldring,
Ounninghame Graham, Marmaduke Pick-
thall, Frank Swinnerton, Hugh Walpole and
Israel Zangwill.
It is obvious, too, that even Wells and
Bennett have suffered as artists from their
journalistic training; each betrays certain
“slick” and ephemeral qualities which are
inevitably associated with the type of mind
bred of the necessity for grinding out regular
quantities of “copy.” And Wells and Ben-
nett are the stars of the journalists’ firma-
ment.
The step from journalist to novelist is a
natural one, and it is only to be expected that
pany journalists would be tempted to take
it; but it is also not unnatural that the
journalist should find himself in a strange
world when he ventures into the realm of
the novel. The finest novelists of our day
(such men as Conrad, Hardy, George Moore,
E. M. Forster) were novelists by sheer
necessity; not one of them would have
been conceivable as a journalist.
There is little in common between the
two crafts. One demands quickness of per-
ception, ease and fluency in writing, a keen
interest in passing events, a sense for the
immediately dramatic, and an indefatigable
industry; the other allows the more contem-
plative qualities to flower. The novelist must
have the. capacity (and the time) for reflec-
tive digestion of his experience; he must
have a sense of form on a much wider field
than that to which the journalist is accus-
tomed ; and he can work in a more urbane
atmosphere. Once let a man form the habit
of working under regular and externally-
regulated circumstances, and he will never
be able to ivork well under any other condi-
tions. This essential habit of the newspaper
man is the one fatal habit for the novelist.
He cannot and does not work to a schedule ;
he takes his time, reconsiders, revises, plans
and re-shapes his work with an infinite
patience that exasperates every instinct of
the trained journalist. The latter has formed
the habit of settling his “form” instantly and
expressing himself with the utmost fluency
and rapidity, and he cannot help developing
the almost instinctive feeling that when a
thing is once written it is finished, for good
or ill. The “lazy” methods of the born
novelist outrage the whole unconscious code
his training has implanted in him.
The plain fact, of the matter is that few
genuine journalists have even the desire to
become novelists. When they do, they are
obviously attracted by the material rewards
that the profession of successful novelist
confers. There is no doubt that it pays
better to make a reputation as a novelist
than to work under the anonymity of a
journalist’s life. It is only the journalist
who is unmistakably at the top of his pro-
fession who can hope to be at all widely
known, and even he does not achieve the
fame (or notoriety) which is the lot of
novelists with even modest reputations. Few
men can resist the desire to build on the
apparently firmer foundation of public favor,
and this fact goes far to explain the eager-
ness with which good journalists often turn
tnemselves into indifferent novelists.
WARREN GRAVES.
The Metamorphosis of Mackenzie
When Compton Mackenzie published “Sin-
ister Street” the critics stiffened to atten-
tion, read the book once, read it twice—
and wondered. Marvellous instinct for
word-values, unerring prodigality, a certain
sensuousness, good and bad, and the irides-
cence of poetry ; ease, sense and shimmer, but
yet a lack, though what it was no one seemed
to know. Like the wiseacres of the infan-
tine game, some said this, some said that,
but no one could define it. He had the heels
of Pegasus, but this Pegasus trotted meekly
yoked to a lover’s hansom. What bondage for
a colt of the blue who can “take continents
at a stride!” The magnificence, the flight,
the wonder grassed here, losing sky for land ’
The book was fine. It should ' have been
heroic. One wondered was there any chance
at all of a sea-change. It came. He changed
his creed and with it his style.
“Fairy Gold” shows the divergence more
clearly than “The Altar Steps” or “The
“Heavenly Ladder.” These books are defi-
nitely religious, but “Fairy Gold” is purely
secular. •And the change is stupendous.
I eter s ring has proved more bewildering
than Ariel’s wand. Anyone reading “Fairy
Gold” before “Sinister Street” might deny
that they had a common author. One thing
they still have, the both of them, a peculiar
descriptive magic; but even here there is a
divergence, for “Sinister Street” holds de-
scriptions that are like broad water-colors,
vague dreams of marshy banks and white-
.fleeeed skies; “Fairy Gold” is full of such
descriptions, but every detail is etched in,
every smallest wing and seed, with the care
a purblind Chinese craftsman gave an
ancient vase. The descriptions of Roon are
prose poems. Nothing has been written to
surpass them in this age. Only lie could have
sensed the bracken opening its downy fists.
In “Sinister Street” names and places are
mentioned casually, accidentally ; in “Fairy
Gold” he knows the insides of the birds’
nests, and the minute of the breaking of the
flowers. Only a naturalist could appreciate
that penetrative vision, that microscopic con-
science of his.
But wherein lies the change? If there was
one novelist for lovers it was Mackenzie. He
knew all the murmurous ways of love mrl’s
love, boy’s love, man’s love. When one thinks
of Carnival or of Sylvia Scarlett, the change
is breathtaking. Not that there has been no
warning. There was little or no lovemaking
in The Altar Steps” and “The Heavenly Lad-
der No one was expecting it in thUse books.
But to read a love tale by the creator of
Jenny and of Sylvia, and to find the man
and maid as faint and ethereal as anythin-
JJSff . of Fimbo or Uvonesse— there’s the rub!
Fairy Gold reads like a legend out of the
Round Table, sweet and ghostly and unreal.

When they embrace, it is as lovers out in
Tir Nan Og; as two shy leaves would toucn
in a wind. There is a dimness abou
story like the dimness of her hair, and -
itself is like a magic casement over taeiy
seas. Could Keats come back t 0 ® art r,
would salute Mackenzie. Only the D -
querie of Yenetia rouses one from the diea y
trance. ,
What has happened? Is this another pra
of puckish genius that took a night ol quips
and pinches in “Poor Relations .Or is
it going to be his style in the future? Does
he fear a descent from the heights ot hi 3
exaltation if he touches things earthy ! lhe
Chair of Peter, it is thought, generally but
erroneously, condemned the classics. It lias
never condemned the best of the classics,
but it has condemned their wildest pagan
excesses. Shane Leslie was brought up
standing very sharply the other day tor a
lapse into pruriency in his latest novel, lie
beat his breast and said “Med Culpa . .ah®
Vatican’s attitude seems to be that it isn t
worth while raking the midden to find a
jewel; but its ideas are variously interpreted,
and some of its followers, from fear °f offend-
ing, go to the opposite extreme and become
dull or unearthly. The sense of inhibition
spreads like an ice-slieet, and though ice has
a cold, blue beauty of its own its touch is
numbing. Mackenzie seems almost afraid to
become human. It is a mistake. One can
have naturalness without indecency, and it
is too late to go back to Lyonesse or Tir
Nan Og. Peter’s Chair insists on chastity,
but not on prudishness.
It may be that in his search for a beauty
that was clean he has given up men for
nature, but man with his stains is held
higher than stainless bird or sinless flower
by his Maker. Mackenzie is still young, and
the years may give him back his humanity
all the richer for its hours upon Thabor. He
has the conscience and the judgment of a
great artist, and to these have been added
the nobility of fast and vigil. He will never
write again wholly as the crowd desires. He
is magnificently indifferent. But in that
merciless purging something warm and
earthy and lovable has gone out leaving an
austerity dazzling and terrible. His linen
is cleansed with a vengeance. It has become
samite.
EILEEN DUGGAN.
Toleration
Henrik Willem van Loon’s intensely in-
teresting hook, “The Liberation of Mankind:
the Story of Man’s Struggle for the Right to
Think,” leads the reader on to two appa-
rently paradoxical conclusions. The one is
that man can never be tolerant while lie
fears, the other that in times of stress the
only man who ever is tolerant is the man
who doubts. Galsworthy, in a short story
he once wrote, told how a t starving dog
attacked a man who kicked it. The man
told another man that the dog was mad, and
soon the whole village of simple, kindly,
orderly people was stoning the dog to death.
Galsworthy shows how fear breeds cruelty.
Van Loon shows in his book how it breeds
intolerance. He also shows what a tremen-
dously necessary part this intolerance has
played in the development of the human race.
Man, the most defenceless of all mammals,
has been able to maintain himself against
“microbes and mastodons and ice and heat,”
and has eventually become the master of
creation. How has he done it? Van Loon
believes by his ability to sink, whenever
necessary, his individuality in the composite
character of the tribe, and his faculty of
maintaining tribal discipline and direction
by assuming and believing in a god. It
is in his possession of this latter faculty that
man is superior to the animals. The wolf
pack is led by the strongest wolf. That wolf
disciplines and directs the pack, but there is
nothing to discipline and direct the wolf. Pri-
mitive man was led by the strongest man, but
that strongest man was disciplined and directed
by the assumed and acknowledged tribal god.
There was the “taboo” to which the lowest and
highest of the tribe had to conform. Thus
the tribe was disciplined and organised. And
thus whilst the struggle to exist and main-
tain itself was on it had to remain. There
was no such thing then as tolerance. The
taboo-questioner and the “live-and-let-live”
man were menaces to the tribe’s existence.
They were suppressed. It is only when the
tribe becomes all powerful and unthreatened,
when it ceases to fear, that it can afford to
be tolerant. When it is obviously threat-
ened, when fear comes, then tolerance goes.
It was so with the primitive tribe. It was
so with the Greek Republic when it con-
demned Socrates to death. It was so with
the Roman Empire when it persecuted the
Christians. It was so with the Church when
it began to persecute those who disagreed
with it. It was so in our own time when
the Great War came. In 1913 one could
think and express one’s thoughts, at least in
England, France, Italy, Germany. Then
came the war, and all these nations were
threatened, and in them all freedom to think
ceased for the time to be.
D. H. Lawrence writes somewhere, “There
is no such thing as Liberty.... there is only
a changing of chains.” The great reformers,
Van Loon points out, never fought for tolera-
tion ; they only fought for another form of
intolerance. Calvin, for instance, fought
against the intolerance of Rome and won his
battle. Then he proceeded to institute
another but just as rigid form of intolerance.
It has always been so. The tolerant age
never comes as the result of any fighting
for it. It comes as a sort of accident of
circumstances. The conditions must be ripe.
A certain place is geographically conveni-
ently situated for the transport development
of a certain age. It becomes a trade centre.
People of different nationalities and believing
in different gods gather to it and settle in it.
Their differences are secondary to their one
common object—trade. The trade-centre
flourishes. It Ts the nucleus of an empire.
It becomes all powerful. Free thinking
does not it. So a tolerant
age comes. II is always a commercially rich
age. But freedom to think makes for lack
of discipline. The emperor loses his majesty,
the gods their divinity, and the people cease
to fear them. The Roman Empire fell be-
cause of its easy tolerance. The Christian
church that took over from it survived what
the empire could not survive only by
exercising the harshest forms of intolerance.
“Since the beginning of time,” writes
Van Loon, “it has seemed inevitable that
there should be one group of clever men and
women who do the ruling and a much larger
group of not-so-bright men and women who
do the obeying.” But the first group are
obeyers too. When a revolutionary move-
ment shows signs of succeeding, a rush of
the competent people sets in to get the best
available jobs under the new regime. When
the Roman Empire failed, the same class that
had carried on the empire crossed over, as
it were, and carried on for the Church. Such
people always go where there is the best
pay and the best chance of advancement. The
true followers of the first Christian move-
ment were turned out. It is always so. The
people who started the Great War did not
carry it on. The people who had been the
ruling class before the war became the ruling
class in the war. Such a class constitutes the
“doers” of life. They are the great acceptors.
The only man who can be tolerant regard-
less of time or place or circumstances is the
sceptic, the doubter. He sees too far to be
sure and certain of his own “rightness.” He
is doubtful whether he is wholly right or
whether the man of convictions is wholly
wrong. So he is tolerant even of intolerance.
It would seem, then, that tolerance weakens
whilst intolerance strengthens. The plant
blossoms and the blossom is the aim of the
plant. But there can be no blossom without
the plant. The first essential is for the plant
to survive. Man’s aim is a tolerant age, but
the race must survive. Intolerance has kept
it alive in the past, and full of suppressed
blossoming. And in the future? Listen to
what this American philosopher has to say.
“The day will come when tolerance shall be
the rule, when intolerance shall be a myth
like the slaughter of innocent captives, the
burning of widows, the blind worship of a
printed page. It may take ten thousand
years, it may take a hundred thousand. But it
will come, and it will follow upon the first
true victory of which history shall have any
record—-the triumph of man over his own
fear.”
ALAN D. MICKLE.
Australian Composers
Recently a lot of suggestions have been
put forward as to why Australian authors
leave home. They leave for the same reason
as Australian composers. Because, as far
as publishers are concerned, they are not
wanted here. Two of the biggest ballad
hits of the past decade have been written
by Australians. May Brahe wrote “It’s
Quiet Down Here,” and Adams was respon-
sible for “The Bells of St. Malo’s.” May
Brahe is reputed to have taken her songs
to every publisher in Australia, and Adams
probably did the same. Then there is Molly
Carew, whose “Love’s a Merchant” created
a furore. And William James, whose almost
musically-perfect album of Australian bush
songs have sold about ten times as well in
England as here. They were not wanted
by Australian publishers. The English firms
reap the benefit.
As one of the little band who have had
a song or two rejected here and accepted
in England, I have a melancholy interest in
analysing the reasons why we are despised
by our own country’s publishers. ■ Their
own statements are invariably:—
(1) They cannot afford to take a chance with the
small capital at their disposal. They can only
afford to stock the English and American winners.
(2) Australians deliberately refrain from buying
a song when) they think it is a local production.
(3) Whilst our own songs are “very nice” and
“pleasing”—to quote one firm —they are not up
to English standard.
Individual firms have other reasons which
they unload on to the young composers, but
the above three hardy annuals are trotted
out by all.
It is admitted that music publishers are
not in the game for the good of their health.
It is also admitted that in criticising them
one is open to the charge of trying to teach
his grandmother how to suck eggs. At the
risk of this, there is a strong temptation
to reply to the above three main conten-
tions :
(1) These firms often bring a song to Australia
which obstinately refuses to repeat its overseas
success. It wouldn’t cripple their finances to risk a
home-grown ballad once in a while.
(2) The general public responds to the lure of a
clever advertisement in any field whatsoever. Most
Australian-born ballads have been pushed out into
the hard cold world without the slightest attempt
to have them introduced by our own or visiting
singers. Suppose that every visiting artist sang
two Australian-written songs on every programme
throughout his tour, wouldn’t that be responsible for
the sale of some thousands of copies, if the song
had any merit at all? And what visiting artist
would refuse to do this? When one thinks of some
of the ballads that Clara Butt, Paul Althouse and
many other world stars have suffered us to listen
to, one is convinced that they would be only too
glad to get a few well-written ones from the country
in which they were touring.
(3) The contention that our song-writers are
below par is absurd when one knows the subsequent
success of many Australian rejects in London.
There is not the slightest doubt that music
is going to have a tremendous future here.
Already we are world renowned for the
quality of the voices we are sending to
London. There is a duty as well as a busi-
ness in being a publisher of any form of
expression. The! eternal cry of “Give the
people what they'want” is begging the ques-
tion. What chaince would Beethoven have
of ever getting sonata printed to-day ? I
wonder if even one of Franz Schubert’s
songs would be (accepted. I asked a pub-
lisher friend of mine the latter question
last week. He grinned cheerfully and said,
“Not unless he jazzed it.”
There are dozens of at least average com-
posers in Australia. The refusal of their
works by publishers must inevitably make
for our musical retrogression. “Hope de-
ferred maketh the’ heart sick.” The British
Musical Society is doing something to help
us along. But beyond the satisfaction that
comes to every man on hearing his brain-
children being intnoduced to the world, the
mere performing of a work is nothing com-
pared with the power of print and publi-
cation.
One gets sick to death at the mere men-
tion of the words “State subsidy.” But
surely if we must have State fish-shops,
brickworks and bakeries, we might also have
State aid for baby composers.
KEITH BARRY.
The Rudd Family
C. H. Winter (B. 16/12/’2G) is at least
orthodox in his views on the “On Our Selec-
tion” series. “On Our Selection” was a
tour de force. It was a faithful record of
its time and place, a photographic picture of
one section only of the pioneer selectors. The
later books in the series have falsely made
typical of the whole body of selectors that
one section. No Australian writer to-day
dare write of any other class of farmer. He
might be true to nature, but he would not be
true to the Rudd tradition.
I have known Australian farmers inti-
mately for 35 years, Queensland farmers for
20. I have- known very many ignorant, but
few such vulgarians as the Rudds; some
as violent as Dad, but very few so incom-
petent. (Does not all the comic relief in
the Rudd drama arise from the family’s
gross bungling of the simplest of farm opera-
tions?) And surely of the few cross-grained,
foul-mouthed incompetents I have known,
none were ever so successful as the Rudds,
nor ever could be.
One does not know who the “ intelligentsia”
of C. H. Winter’s peroration may be, but
one is reasonably sure that no intelligent
readers would have desired “good” old Dad’s
ill temper and bad language replaced by
gloom and morbidity; nor his verbs more
mistreated than his other parts of speech;
nor to have a pornographic streak substituted
for such an episode as the ridiculing by the
whole family of the school-teaching sister
because she took a bath. That episode alone
is a particularly beastly slander on the very
class whom Steele Rudd knows “intimately
and affectionately.”
BRONSON ELLIOTT.
A Satchel of Books
The Travels of Marco Polo (Dent). Marco Polo
brought back to thirteenth-century Europe the first
reliable account of teeming Asia. Europe repaid
him by calling him a liar. The present edition is
a reprint of one of 1854, and its notes are sadly
out of date.
Shen of the Sea, by Arthur Bowie Chrisman
(Dent). Quaintly humorous tales with a Chinese
background, which were awarded a medal by the
American Library Association as “the most dis-
tinguished contribution to children’s literature during
the year.”
Black Jack Davy, by J. M. Askison (Appleton).
This is the second of this author’s novels in which
he has made the Indian Territory of early U.S.A.
days, now Oklahoma, his stage. As a picture
of the trials of the pioneers of the prairie lands of
the West, it has historical value, and the author
writes of the human characters out of personal ex-
perience.
Shipping and Commerce of Australia, from the
publishers of the daily “Shipping List.” A large,
thick, illustrated folio, chock-full of practical infor-
mation about the exports, imports, manufactures
products, transport arrangements, banking ana
finance of this continent. It answers almost every
question one could reasonably ask on those subjects,
and some that one wouldn’t think of asking. lor
instance, a tin of biscuits was sent to Beyiout fiom
Melbourne last year, and the compilers found it out.
Princess Highway, by E. J. Brady (Ramsay Pot)"
lishing Co.). A popular myth has been created that
this great thoroughfare got its name because Edward
P. rode along it from Adelaide to Brisbane. Ihe story
is a canard, the young man probably never canter-
ing more than five miles of its length, but it is
steadily gaining in popularity with intrepid motor-
ists. The Bulletin poet, in a series of informal
sketches, has collected the available history of several
sections, and chats interestingly about its scenic
splendors.
Cattle Chosen, by E. 0. G. Shann (Oxford Univer- •
sity Press). The "compiler of this story of the first
group-settlement in Westralia covering the period
1829-41 draws most of his material from the
diaries and letters of the Bussell family. The
leader of the group, John Garrett Bussell, eldest
son of an Anglican clergyman, was himself intended
for holy orders; but, influenced by the glowing
accounts received from officers on service in the
new southern land, he and his relatives packed up
and in 1829 embarked with other settlers. They
pitched their tent and built up the pastoral estate
of “Cattle Chosen,” after many trials and vicissi-
tudes described in the records of the family. The
story, though necessarily patchy, is full of interest.
An officer stationed in Sydney, writing to a friend
in England in the twenties of last century, furnishes
a contrast between the cost of living in the mother
colony a hundred years ago and to-day. “A single
gentleman here, with a little economy, might,” he
says, “keep his carriage on £l5O a year.”
Fancy Dress, and Other Verse, by Dorothea Mac-
kellar (Angus and Robertson). Judging by its
title, Dorothea Mackellar, a valued contributor to
The Bulletin, does not wish her latest collection
of scholarly verse to be regarded as her highest
flights. In any case, the volume is pleasant to read ;
her style is happy, her verse is always tidy and well-
tailored ; she has the faculty of selecting the apt
word and the right phrase; and a dainty feminine
humor peeps out on many a page. Here is one
of her pleasing impressions;—
“Here’s the land of milk and honey was promised
us of old —
Tall silver blue-gums ankle-deep in wattle gold;
Grey clouds and thunder-blue and shaken white,
A hillside trembling in the thin spring light—-
Light that’s blowing from a stormy sky like silver-
shot silk.
The wattles like honey and the gums like milk.’’
She keeps in the middle register of her emotions,
and her humor is neatly feminine. She can make
poetry even in the queue of cars waiting to cross
the harbor. How many impatient motorists would
console themselves like this?:—
“As we wait, there are, thank Heaven,
Pleasant things to see:
Half the lamps of Sydney sparkling
Tangled in a tree;
On the harbor’s steel-blue mirror
Far and far below
Jewelled dragonflies and beetles
Skimming to and fr 0....
Now we move—the stars burn brighter
In the mystic blue—
What will be the next bright drop-scene
Hung before the queue?’’
Usually sedate and serious in her work, she cannot
resist the cuddle of a child: —
“His smile was wide and his cheeks were round.
He laughed as if he would break in pieces,
He was all soft curves where he wasn’t creases.
Two deep creases on each fat wrist.
Three in the neck which his mother kissed
Every seven minutes or 50....
His mother says—and she ought to know—
As she stoops and kisses him ever so,
She says he keeps her ‘all of a muddle.’....
But oh, I wish he were mine to cuddle!”

A Masterpiece
of Design
at the Cost of an Ordinary Car
THE Studebaker Deluxe Sedan has the
greyhound grace of a long, low-swung
body, with lustrous duotone lacquer finish and
sumptuous mohair upholstery.
It is a masterpiece of Deluxe design with all
the luxury of costly equipment found ordin-
arily only in special-built cars.
One of the features of this beautiful closed car
is a ventilating system (exclusively Stude-
baker) which ensures fresh air without
draughts or moisture. There are four-wheel
brakes, disc wheels and practically every item
of equipment the owner desires.
It unites the quiet smoothness and power of
the Studebaker L-head motor with the riches
of Deluxe detail. Its moderate cost is the re-
sult of Studebaker’s One-Profit facilities —an
unprecedented value —as you will agree wheij
you see this car.

from

Chrysler Standardized Quality
There is scarcely a motor
car of importance today that
does not reflect in either de-
sign or practice the influ-
ence of Walter P. Chrysler
and his engineers.
This is because in the past
three years the organization
of which Mr. Chrysler is
the head has pioneered more
improvements in the auto-
mobile than had been
brought forth in the pre-
ceding decade.
The result has been quality
beyond comparison and
now Mr. Chrysler further
emphasizes this quality —
makes it more than ever
outstanding in all price
classes —by h is plan of Stand-
ardized Quality.
Mr. Chrysler is the first and
only large scale manufac-
turer building four cars
under one name and one
management in one group
of unified plants on a Stand-
ardized Quality basis.
This standardization of
quality is the result of an
extraordinarily complete
co-ordination of engineer-

mg and manufacturing fa-
cilities and resources.
It governs every minutest
operation from the first
rough sketch of the engi-
neers, through the working
blue print; it governs the
selection of the raw mate-
rials; it compels manufac-
ture of even the smallest
part as well as the vital units
to the most precise stand-
ards; it molds even the man-
ufacture of accessories.
The result is that each and
every model of the four
Chrysler types is standard-
ized as to quality.
And the quality of the low-
est-priced Chrysler is as
unquestionable as that of
the highest-priced Chrysler.
There is a difference, of
course, in the price of Chry-
sler models, from the new
Chrysler Four, finest of
fours, through the line of
the lighter, lower-priced
Chrysler Six,(model H),the
superb Chrysler Six, (model
G) and the Chrysler Impe-
rial Six, as fine as money
can build.
But all are absolutely the
same in rigid adherence to
the law of finer quality.
Thus certainty of Chrysler
unsurpassed performance
is built into each and every
Chrysler model by the
Chrysler principle of Stand-
ardized Quality. It brings
Chrysler superiority in
speed, power, beauty, com-
fort, roadability and long
life within the reach of prac-
tically every purse. It en-
ables every motorist to buy
in any of the four general
price classifications, with
complete assurance of re-
ceiving all the brilliancy
and dependability of service
for which Chrysler has es-
tablished a reputation
throughout the world.

O wind, O whispering wanderer!
You breathe a word that fills
My heart with longing for the deep
Blue silence and the rugged sweep
Of unforgotten hills.
For me there is no home where plains
Lean up to clasp the stooping sky;
No home, but only loneliness,
Where long waves lift their low caress,
Or fine foam dashes high.
O wind, O welcome wanderer!
You breathe a song that fills
My heart with anguish that is sweet
With memories of joyous feet
On unawakened hills.

The Flower Farm.
Here all the little airs that stir
Blend the sweet odors ipto one
Of furrowed earth, and lavender
And ripe grass drying in the sun.
Far up the gentle slope prolonged,
There nods and waves against the rise
A hedge of summer lilac thronged
With multitudes of butterflies.
The sprinklers like quick fountains play
O'er floral armies trimly ranked,
Carnations leaved with greenish grey.
Tall antirrhinums patched and pranked;
Sort poppies, delicate as flame,
And, here and there, a little plot
That bears some quaint, old-fashioned name—
Sweet sultan or forget-me-not.
As each recurring season brings
New wealth the tended rose to dress,
Fresh to the inward vision clings
Remembrance of some loveliness.
Larkspurs ablaze beneath the noon,
Or a great drift of virgin’s bower.
Wreathing in arch wherein the moon
Blossoms like some belated flower;
Or, treasured for the soul to gloat
Upon in winter’s barren glooms,
A pair of halcyons afloat
Over a field of pansy blooms.

At Sunrise on a Northern Lagoon.
H ere on the long lagoon the glory glows
Of ancient Egypt—the sweet lotus flower,
Rose-colored, lily-leaved, with heart of gold;
But here and there the limpid water shows
Between the island leaves. The blossoms
tower
With buds like sleeping tulips, fold on fold.
Alert and quaint, the slender lotus bird
Runs o’er the leaves, and the grave, black-
necked stork
And brolga stride among the rustling reed
The flutter of white ibis wings is heard;
And red-capped parrots from a leafy fork
Scatter the blossoms as they search for seed
A cloud of duck that whistle as they fly;
Geese on the marge where nut-sweet grassc
grow;
Cold crystal air, in which the black maim
smoke
From his small fire soars straight and blue
and high.
Awhile he tends it, waving to and fro
His bunch of leaves with soft and subtle
stroke.
White, white the water-lilies on the lake;
The blushing lotus tall among the sedge ; ■
On silvered gums the first rays of the sun .
Bird-calls and beating wings a transport
make.
All these—and these ! —I stand upon the edge
Of God’s own garden, where bright waters
run !

Materialism.
I seek no more for gods among
The lace-like ferns and twisted boughs,
And little care though these should house
The riddles whence all life has sprung;
The Presence whose dim dream endows
The universes with the store
Of all that they possess, or fays
Dancing light-foot down leafy ways,
Or Pan, Jehovah, Brahma, Thor —
The man-made gods of earlier days.
Not now, as once, I seek the cause,
The soul of life, the secret tide
Whereon all things we know of ride,
Obedient to destined laws.
I seek no longer to divide
Being from that which gives it place,
Matter from spirit, for I rate
Animate and inanimate
Life, time and substance, action, space,
As unity infinitely great.
But I grow angry with my thought,
Which plunges rudderless and amiss
Within this stormy, deep abyss—
Presumptuous atom to have sought
(Embodiment of all that is)
The greater Apollo whose wide reach
Embraces the unguessed-at years.
Shaming our ethics, creeds and fears,
Shaming the priests for what they teach,
Shaming the narrow-visioned seers !
The valley path is calm and cool,
As I walk here between green walls—•
And those are diamond waterfalls;
This is a bird, and that’s a pool ';
I heard their loud, insistent calls,
And gladly have returned to these.
What is revealed to me and known
Beyond material things alone?
It is enough that trees are trees,
That earth is earth and stone is stone.

THE NATION’S UNFINISHED
BUSINESS.
It is not good to make stinking-fish a pro-
fession ; still it is well to have at least an
annual stocktaking, and to look at the things
that have not been done, or which were
partly done and left unfinished, or which
were done and lost again, and then to tell
ourselves the plain truth about them. So
let us get to the shelves.
• * * * *
N. S. Wales, which was Australia then,
built its first little ship in 1789, and its first
steamship in 1831. The business grew in a
rather fitful way till in 1903 the Common-
wealth produced 195 craft, including pon-
toons and oddments. The net tonnage was
4519. Apart from Government work done
on a non-commercial basis, that represented
a sort of culmination; thereafter the output
steadily sagged, and the output for 1925 was
14 vessels of 1648 tons in all. The fine harbor
of Port Stephens (N.S.W.) was located in
1796. It is still without a railway, and for
commercial purposes it is much as it was in
1796. Another fine harbor was discovered
at Twofold Bay (N.S.W.) in 1797. Placed
as it is between Sydney and Melbourne the
bay might seem to fill a want, but there
being no State capital on the _ spot it was
also left without a railway, and its shores are
adorned with the ruins of an abandoned
town, and with a live hamlet which holds a.
population, including some surrounding dis-
tricts, of 1050. The remains of old Boyd-
town consist of part of a pub too solid to be
stolen. Australia is young to be the owner
of abandoned towns. As early as 1801 the
manufacture of blankets and linen began in
a small way at Sydney, but the industry
dropped out of notice again for a long time.
The linen section can hardly be said to have
ever come back. The next year (1802) was
a busy one in Australia’s history, for it was
then that the pair of really superb ports
which Queensland has to its credit (Glad-
stone and Bowen) were put on the map. The
census-man in 1921 found only a reposeful
hamlet beside each of them, and there is no
report of the repose having been disturbed
since. The record is: Bowen “and district,
3000 inhabitants; Gladstone, 1500. Yet a
multitude of money has gone in the endeavor
to create impossible, or highly improbable,
outlets for commerce away up the Brisbane,
the Mary and the Fitzroy. Gladstone was
made the capital of a new colony in 1846,
but, possibly because it was too good for the
metropolitan job, it was shortly afterwards
deposed and the new colony (North Aus-
tralia) rooted up. Australia is young to
have an abandoned colony also on its
record.
* * * *
Albany and Portland, which had been long
familiar, were officially “settled” in 1826
and 1834, and Darwin was discovered in
1839. Portland is a useful sort of inlet.
Albany is the best thing of its kind that
Nature has provided on the vast stretch of
coast between Eyre Peninsula (S.A.) and
Derby (W.A.). As for Darwin, it ranks
among the world’s great harbors. It is part
of Australia’s unfinished business that the
three towns so well provided with the essen-
tials of progress add up, •so far, to a joint
population of about 7700. The biggest of
them is hardly large enough to form a
quorum. It was contemporary with the be-
ginnings of Albany—that is to say, it was 90
years ago—that someone demonstrated the
possibilities of Australia as a producer of
excellent cotton. The discovery is bearing
some fruit, but the tree is manured witli
Government subsidies, and its staying power
without them is not yet proved.
* * * *
Then in 1842 something was planted which
took root and grew, slowly at first, but later
at a pace which made the cactus look like
a non-starter and left the rabbit among those
who “also ran.” It was the year of the
first public borrowing. N. S. Wales began
by raising 10 loans in Sydney, and even re-
paid some part of them out of revenue. They
weren’t large, but nothing of the sort was
lai-ge in those days. Even when fool poli-
ticians went to London, they asked for less
than £700,000, spread by instalments over a
long term. Victoria raised four local loans
in four years, one of them for a million, before
it went after the fleshpots of John Bull,
and in 1868 it was floating loans in both
places and paying in London the full Mel-
bourne rate. So far as the evidence shows
there was no shadow of necessity to start
an outside loan policy, but some fatuous
characters thought it would be pretty and
luxurious and boomsome to see money pour-
ing in, and never dreamt of interest pour-
ing out. The most stupendous of the nation’s
uncompleted jobs is that of putting right the
financial muddle which began so needlessly
in the middle of last century. A minor pro-
blem (minor by comparison only) is that
of Australia’s one and only attempt at a
real transcontinental railway, as distin-
guished from a coastal line of shreds and
patches. Building from the north, the line
reached the Katherine River in 1889, and
it stayed there till a fragment was added in
quite recent times. Building from the south,
the railhead reached Oodnadatta in 1891,
and with a thousand miles to go it remains
there still. It has remained there through
26 years of Federation, and through 16
years during which the Commonwealth has
owned the Territory, having acquired it and
the unfinished bits of rail under a pledge
that the straight line would be built. There
are railways across Canada, the United
States, Mexico, Central America, South
America, Europe, Asia, South Africa and
Maoriland, but when the Australian petri-
fies he does it hard. The typical Prime Min-
ister has become afraid to redeem the long-
overdue promise and complete the transcon-
tinental highway lest he should be suspected
of a cowardly yielding to pressure. Yet in
completion lies the only hope of putting the
work on a paying basis, also the best hope
of making good our claim to a great empty
region, and the best chance that another
Kalgoorlie may be made accessible to help
tide over the next financial breakdown, and
the most hopeful prospect of convincing the
world that this community can do big things
as well as Mexicans and Argentines.
* * * *
The outstanding evidence of the tendency
to sit down in peace beside a suspended or
hung-up job lies in the fact that the popu-
lation map based on the census of 1921 pre-
sents such a fatal resemblance to the map
of 1901. Population increased by 2,700,000
in the 20 years’ interval, which was pro-
bably as much as could be expected amid so
many adverse conditions, including artificial
and superfluous conditions, but the new
people didn’t spread much. Australia wants
more States, more State capitals to be cen-
tres of population, more small industrial
towns, more self-reliance, including reliance
on its own products, a definite national plan
of campaign, and fewer odds and ends, in-
cluding loose ends and dead ends. Other-
wise there is just a possibility that it may
become a dead end itself, which would be a
pity. For a nation to make so fair a start
and fail to arrive might even be classed as
a tragedy.
SIX MILLIONS.
Y ear ago the Commonwealth Statistician,
w j lo ]i]j es exact figures, declared that, as far
, ~ ’ . ..
as ll( ’ could dlscaver after Perusing all the
reports sent m by immigration officers and
registrars of births and deaths, Australia
had a population of 5.954,444. This year
he reckons, by the same lights, that the
total is 6,076,432, The increment was made
up of a margin of births over deaths of 37,464
and a surplus of arrivals over departures of
40,524. Both the natural rate of increase and
the migration rate are smaller than they
were in pre-war years. The reduction in the
natural increase is quite understandable.
Despite the fact that material conditions in
the post-war years have been favorable to
procreation—-a flood of borrowed money con-
tinually increasing in volume has assured
abundant sustenance —the more intelligent
classes of the community have profited by
the teachings of the little band of pioneers
which has pointed out that human beings
need not propagate tlieir kind unless they
want to. The reduction in the migration
increase is not'very much harder to explain.
In Britain, the natural source from which
Australia should draw her migrants, it has
become the custom to give State aid to all
persons who are out of employment—and
aid on a scale that bids fair, in the course
of a generation or two, if Britain continues
to be unable to find employment for her
superfluous millions, to destroy the will to
work that is part of the instinct of every
normal member of the genus homo sapiens.
* * * *
Lloyd George’s, error, of course, was the
fundamental one of flouting the injunction
laid on Adam : “In the, sweat of thy brow
slialt thou earn thy bread.” To subsidise
idleness among the “lower classes” was an
error of statescraft that no predecessor of
the Welsh attorney among all the politicians
of all time, with the possible exception of
Jack Gade, would have thought twice about
falling into. It was a magnificent mistake,
and one that will earn the man who com-
mitted it a bad eminence in tradition
throughout the ages. There is no method
of community organisation known to man-
kind that can avoid subsidising idleness
amongst those who live on the rent or in-
terest, or both, bequeathed them by some puis-
sant ancestor, acquired by successful fraud,
or taken as a matter of predatory instinct
by individuals strong enough to impose their
will openly upon their fellows. Neither
Soviet Itussia nor tbe various communistic
States whose),failures diversify economic his-
tory have been able to dodge such subsidies.
It has been the salvation of human endea-
vor that the individuals who have been able
to command such tribute have been few, and
their exactions colored by some more or
less acceptable pretension to right—Divine
or legal. But to confer upon millions of men
and women such a privilege was to run
counter to all the laws men have made for
themselves and the precepts of all their reli-
gions. Even the stars in their coui’ses
fought against the folly -of the Welshman.
The great republic across the Atlantic closed
its doors to the flood of humanity that
sought to pass from a war-ravaged Europe
to a land that ensured every good honest
worker a chance of a footing on the ladder
to affluence. The elder statesmen of the
Empire, preoccupied though they were, like
Martha, with small domestic affairs, saw
dimly that chaos loomed on the horizon, and
sought by counter-subsidies to migration to
stave off disaster. But the efforts that have
been made to re-distribute Empire popula-
tion have been consistently thwarted, firstly
by Lloyd George’s 'dole, and secondly by a
failure to appreciate the fact that the
Dominions are growing up, and that they
no longer are content to regard themselves
as dumping-grounds. So it comes about that
Australia, which is steeped in political errors
of its own, gets but few migrants.
* * * *
A Scot named Macßride, who holds a chair
of zoology at South Kensington, thinks that
the best thing that could be done with the
dole-demoralised paupers of Britain would
be to dump them into “the wilder parts of
Australia,” and let them root for a living.
He may be right. They would either live
or die, and those ,who survived would have
unimpeachable qualifications for Australian
citizenship. But it can’t be done. It would
be easier to trek from even the wildest parts
of Australia to Sydney (area 150 sq. miles),
which holds half the population of the not
unfertile State of N. S. Wales (area 300,000
sq. miles) , than to attempt to make a living
in the wilderness. And on arrival at Syd-
ney they would swell the slum population
and "the Labor vote, and—so long as the
loan fountain continued to spout —most of
them would get a job at digging up
the streets and laying them down again.
There are stages in the affairs of mice
and men where it is fairly clear that things
will have to get worse before they get better.
Australia won’t get better until things have
got worse. The worst thing that could
happen to Australians in the mood they have
been educated up to by successive genera-
tions of loan-mongering politicians would
be an abrupt turning-off of the loan tap.
The-immediate result, judged by the experi-
ence of colonial communities in the past—
Australia included —would be a decrease in
population. At present, the country is not
in shape to support, in the style to which
they have been accustomed, all its present
population. There would be a thinning-out.
Then those who could not afford to get away
and those who would prefer to make a fight
of it would have to buckle to and make an
honest effort to see how much wealth could
be got out of the Commonwealth. By the
time they had begun to get an inkling of the
possibilities that awaited exploitation,, popu-
lation would start to flow in again—and it
wouldn’t be the sort one would want to
segregate in desolate and inaccessible spots,
either. Macßride, with that utter disregard
for feelings that characterises elderly Scots
with a passion for facts, remarks that prize
pigs with shortened snouts, defective teeth and
feeble legs would develop longer noses, a
better dental equipment and sturdy limbs if
they had to skirmish for food. The moral is
sufficiently obvious.
WOMAN—THE WORLD’S HOPE.
It is one of the curious features of our day
that the difference between the sexes is taken
to imply the inferiority of woman. Lester
Ward in his “Pure Sociology” says: “The
idea that the female is naturally and really
the superior sex seems incredible, and only
the most liberal and emancipated minds,
possessed of a large store of biological in-
formation, arc capable of realising it.
“Every high peak in the historic landscape is
masculine,” Peter Airey lately wrote in The
Bulletin. Yet Sappho was considered by
the Greeks a great poet, Myrtis was said to
have been the teacher of Pindar, Socrates
admitted he obtained philosophical instruc-
tion from Aspasia. And to-day there is
little, if any, inferiority in the artistic and
literary output of women. But even if that
was not so, the case against woman would
not be complete; when she has had the
preparation which men have had for so many
centuries it will be fairer to judge.
Moreover, woman does give birth to many
a fresh thought—and passes it on to man,
who tests it and then uses it as his own.
When man enslaved woman he destroyed in
her the qualities of courage, initiative and
independence, those virtues being useless to
a slave. With her return to freedom she
will develop, in addition to those, other an 1
finer qualities. Edward Carpenter was
right when he said that “women really free
would never countenance for their mates the
many unclean and mean types of men who
to-day seem to have things all their own
way. Feminine influence will sway to the
evolution of a more manly and dignified
race !” And his improvement will mean hers.
But I want to stress the point that
woman’s power and man’s future lie entirely
in the difference of sex. Benjamin Kidd
declares: “It is not in the male of the race,
it is in woman that we have the future
centre of power in civilisation.” Schopen-
hauer hated woman fiercely and vindictively,
but in his much-quoted essay on woman he
has unwittingly given to her a charter.
“She is the creature to whom the race is
more than the individual, the being to whom
the future is greater than the present.”
Why, then, decry woman because you see no
Dante, Virgil, Plato or Edison in her
ranks? She is the power behind these; she
has enriched life far more than many a
genius. Her work is greater and more im-
portant than theirs. Why the fierce, bitter
attacks on woman by those who followed
Schopenhauer, such as Nietzsche, Weini-
ger and others? Is it possible these men
are voicing what most men pretend doesn’t
exist —namely, fear of woman and her influ-
ence ?
“Woman is man’s natural enemy,” said
Schopenhauer. Why? Because woman,
moved by this scarcely acknowledged emotion
for the furtherance and betterment of the
race, is evolving a new and different form
of civilisation. Men, in the mass, despise
idealism. Their ideal civilisation is one
founded on force. Their desire has invari-
ably been for instant realisation. The male
mind is a fighting mind, and beneath the
veneer of Christianity a Pagan mind. But
force can carry the race no further. It is the
mind of woman that must carry us on to
the next stage. Man must utilise the “differ-
ence” of woman for his own benefit and
advancement. The female mind is filled
with the “emotion of the ideal,” and the
highest form of genius is that which por-
trays the ideal. The being who has the
capacity to express that emotion in philo-
sophy, science, art or literature is express-
ing woman. Thus, woman is the genius
who founds, inspires and sustains ; she is the
subject for man’s greatest and noblest pas-
sions.
Man, while belittling her, tacitly credits
her with a great mysterious power. Morgan
said it was the failure of the Greeks and
Romans to develop womanhood which
brought about the downfall of classic civil-
isation. Havelock Ellis said that “the
woman of the future will help to renew art
and science.” She will do more, for the
destiny of the race rests with her. Walt
Whitman accepted that view. “The sole
avenue and means to a reconstructed society
depends primarily,” he wrote, “on a new
birth, elevation, expansion and invigoration
of women.” Men are adept at hiding great
truths from each other, and though few will
admit it, man turns instinctively to woman
in great need. He has enough intuitive
sense to know she can carry him beyond
difficulties, can broaden his outlook, in some
mysterious way push him into leadership.
The love-letters of Moltke show that even
he, cold-blooded and calculating, turned to
woman for strength. It is her passion for
sacrifice and renunciation that has hitherto
made it easy for man to deny her the fruits
of her own special form of genius.
WINIFRED HAMILTON.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Arrival of the Best Immigrant.
The desire to improve the birth-rate by
giving babes and tlieir mothers a better chance
of survival has been evident in recent years
in Australia no less than in other countries.
Victoria has been probably more active than
any of the other States. The Vic. branch
of the British Medical Association set mat-
ters going in 1924 by the appointment of an
obstetric inquiry committee. This commit-
tee worked hard, and after some months
reported to the branch. An anonymous
donor, inspired by the report, offered a prize
for an essay on the causes and prevention
of maternal morbidity and mortality. The
successful competitor, Dr. E. S. Morris,
treated the subject in a scholarly and com-
prehensive manner. His findings were a
severe indictment of the medical profession.
He also l demonstrated that the baby
bonus has not improved the position of the
parturient woman from the statistical point
of view. Following on the publication of
Dr. Morris’s essay, the Edward Wilson
(Argus) Trust gave £IO,OOO to the Uni-
versity of Melbourne for the appointment
for two years of a director of obstetrical
research, who was to inquire into the
causes of child-birth mortality in Vic-
toria, and suggest means of bringing about
an improvement. Dr. R. Marshall Allan,
the director, has recently issued his interim
report. He has carried out his work along
three main lines. He has made a statistical
investigation, and he has made a survey of
domestic obstetric practice. The interim
report is concerned with these aspects. The
third line of investigation, that of clinical
research, is not complete, and no statement
will be made in this regard until the final
report is presented at the end of 1927. The
first thing to be noted on the statistical
side is that in Victoria the maternal mor-
tality rate in 1925 was 4.34 for every thou-
sand live births. In other words, one woman


died among every 228 avlio were confined.
These figures are somewhat better than those
of the whole Commonwealth, for here one
woman died among every 175. _ When it is
seen that there were 35,922 births in V ic-
toria, and that the maternal deaths from
puerperal causes numbered 156, it is obvi-
ous that the loss to the State is enormous.
Puerperal sepsis Avas responsible for slightly
more than one-third of the total deaths. This
number can be reduced, if punctilious care
be taken. The majority of the other causes
can be eliminated when ante-natal super-
vision is given. It is here that onus must
lie on the medical profession. The public
must be taught, and who is to do the teach-
ing but the medical practitioner? If a
woman is under medical supervision from
the inception of pregnancy until normal
health is restored, little need be feared in
the way of complications, provided that the
doctor knows his job and is conscientious.
In this connection Dr. Allan raises a finger
in warning. Ninety-one per cent, of all
women had medical attention at the time
of delivery. But the attention is not always
judiciously given. Artificial aids are used,
lie declares, much more often than is neces-
sary. At the same time, it is only fair to
add, in the Avords of Dr. Allan, that “there
are more faithful disciples of the obstetric
art than is often suspected.” Although this
report emanates from Victoria, it is of im-
portance to the Avliole of Australia, and the
question naturally arises as to avlio will
carry on the work that Dr. Allan lias
started. The Edaalvrd Wilson Trust cannot
be expected to do it. The Commonwealth
Government handles the immigration ques-
tion, or is supposed to do so, and there are
no better immigrants than healthy Austra-
lian babies, born of healthy Australian
parents. It is time the recommendation of
the Commission of Health was carried into
effect, and that a division of maternity
hygiene was established in the Federal
Department of Health. This is a matter
for the whole CommoiiAvealth.
♦
New Year Fowls Come Home to Roost.
In N. S. Wales and Queensland for the
second half of 1926 the revenue increased
handsomely; but the demand for more and
more expenditure reached a climax, or what
is a climax till a bigger thing arrives.
Queensland, despite its drought, collected
£513,595 more income than in the latter half
of 1925, but expenditure mounted up with
such uncanny agility that the half-year’s
shortage was £925,313. This implies that
there is likely to be a deficit for the year
similar to the last, which was £554,685. The
10 per cent, increase in railway charges
doubtless helped the revenue, and more
“beneficent” legislation, combined with the
automatic expansion of the interest bill,
helped the expenditure. In the closing weeks
of the year 300 men were discharged from
the railways, but the saving was absurdly
insufficient, and the closing of a number of
the worst lines seems more and more immi-
nent. There is very little left to tax in
McCormack’s State with which to meet so
big an emergency. The N. S. AVales posi-
tion is worse. Revenue was £1,428,154 more
than for the second half of 1925, which was
a magnificent Christmas box; but as Lang’s
incredible gang of spendthrifts managed to
increase the expenditure by £1,632,482, the
position is distinctly worse than that of last
year, and last year ended £1,274,500 to the
bad. Lang and his colleagues promised that
the 12 months to next June would show
£1,413,616 better than the previous 12; in
other words, they promised a surplus. But
the seventh month is passing, and no spare
coin rises in the east. If the revenue posi-
tion is bad, the loan situation may easily
turn out worse. The Lang Budget included
£11,316,873 of loan expenditure, and if no
obliging persons lend the money a stoppage
of works and a very great mass of unem-
ployment must folloAV. The question is
whether the Lang Ministry can continue
to borrow. Its demands are enormous. Its
failure to square the public accounts even
when these demands are satisfied is enor-
mous also. Its way of investing the big
sums entrusted to it commands no great con-
fidence. Its manners are not of the best,
and its general attitude that “the capitalist”
on whom it relies so much for its daily sus-
tenance is an undesirable character, and
one to be treated with hostility, is not en-
couraging. In the circumstances, it is hardly
remarkable that the Age, a paper with not
the best of tempers at any time, should have
started a breezy comment in this fashion: —
The Acting Agent-General for N. S. Wales (Lord
Chelmsford) has sent a message to the Premier
stating that he finds it impossible to interest finan-
ciers with regard to loaning money to New South
Wales.
Little or nothing is known as to why the
negotiation for a big loan in New York came
to such a sudden end. The moneyed men
of Gotham may even have made it a condi-
tion that the Ma State should find a different
kind of Government and show some definite
sign of keeping different. Anyhow, Minister
McKell sets out to try his inexperienced hand
at the financial game on a big scale, and he is
at least a polite sort of man who doesn’t irri-
tate people at sight. Minister Badly like-
wise goes to England to inquire into the
handling of coal. One good way to handle
coal is with a shovel.

The Liberal Party in Britain.
The once great Liberal Party of Britain,
which swept the polls as recently as 1906,
when it was returned with a record majority
of 356 over all opponents and stayed in
office until the war came to blur the old
party lines, looks to be nearly at its last
gasp. I,loyd George can still fill a bigger
hall than any other speaker in the U.K.;
also he still sits on a party war chest that
is understood to hold a million pounds or
more. But one man, however eloquent, and
one wad of money, however huge, will not
suffice to keep a party going when its Par-
liamentary following has shrunk to a
paltry 40 members or so in a House of over
600. Even of this handful, nearly half are
represented as viewing the so-called Welsh
AVizard with about as much enthusiasm as
Loughlin exhibits for Lang in N. S. Wales ;
the wretched remnant of a party which dates
almost from Stuart times, and which within
the last 20 yeai's has touched high-water mark
in its hold upon the public, has not only
been battered into impotence from without,
but is torn by internal dissension. At recent
by-elections no less than eight Liberal can-
didates have bottomed the poll with such a
sorry fraction of the votes that they have
lost their deposits. The party, in fine, is
being relentlessly crushed between the upper
millstone of Conservatism and the nether
millstone of Labor. Yet through it all there
is still heard brave talk about the glorious
and imperishable traditions of British
Liberalism, and predictions that it will still
rise again like a Phoenix from its ashes.
How can it? There never have been more
than two great parties in the House of
Commons, one that believes in hastening
slowly and the other that wants to go full
speed ahead all the time, and when Labor
took the lead of Liberalism numerically—
and it is now ahead in the ratio of nearly
4to I—the latter was doomed. Its thunder
for appeals to the proletariat was stolen.
Certainly there have been third parties, like
the Irish Home Rulers, but they couldn’t
form Ministries ; all they did was to sell their
support to one of the two parties that did
count for value received or benefits ex-
pected. It may be suggested that Australia
lias three well-defined, parties with separate
organisations not only in its Federal Parlia-
ment, but in every State Parliament, and
that it manages to Avorry along with them.
Buit there is little, if any, analogy betAveen the
two cases. The Country Party is in no
sense a midway party, as the Liberals have
become in Britain. It is no more advanced
in its aims than the Liberals or Nationals
and no Avhit more in favor of socialistic
legislation. Its differences with the older
anti-Labor party are purely geographical.
It is generally ready to ally itself with the
National party for the purposes of forming
an Administration, as at present in the
Federal Parliament, aijd where it is too
jealously engaged in proclaiming and pre-
serving its separate entity it merely ensures
for Labor a long lease of power, as in Queens-
land. But the remnant of the once great
and often supreme Liberal party in the U.K.,
which has given Britain some of its greatest
statesmen and most of its wholesome social
legislation, can no more ally itself with Con-
servatism, even temporarily, than with Labor.
Either course Avould be tantamount to an
admission that it has outlived all right to
have a policy or a name of its own. And it
has become so feeble in numbers, in Par-
liament if not perhaps in the country, that
its support is hardly worth bidding for by
Government or Opposition. Certainly there
are some great names still associated with it
as well as the memory of great achievements,
but it doesn’t look as if either can prevent
its being squeezed out of existence, despite
the magic of Lloyd George’s personality
and liis bursting war-chest. The average
voter wants one thing or the other; it is
impossible to stir the country into enthu-
siasm for a betwixt-and-between party, more
progressive than one side and less advanced
than the other. That is the invidious posi-
tion the British Liberals have been forced
into.
A
Hoav to Fight Bush Fires.
“Jim Domino” : Although most of Gilbert
Mant’s assertions (B. 23/12/'26) are cor-
rect, I cannot belieA T e that half the crop fires
about the Condobolin and Orange districts
of N. S. Wales this season were started by
tractor exhausts. I consider the open downs
country of Central Queensland the best-
organised fire-fighting centre of Australia;
and although the yearly work on stations
includes fire-break making, and is carried on
extensively by tractors, I have never seen
one fire started by tractors yet, and God
knows I have pulled a fire-plough far enough.
On the Mitch ell-grass downs it is a severe
test, for the exhaust, on Fordsons especi-
ally, trails just over the tips of the easily-
ignited heads. I have slogged at the flames
about Condo and around Nyngan, and, like
Mr. Mant, have often Avondered at the lack
of organisation. At one place on the Bogan
I saAv 60 men clustered about a fire telling
yarns while across the river Avas an inferno.
They were prepared to fight, but didn’t know
where to go ; and, bear in mind, some were
collecting £1 a night! N. S. AVales Avould
do well to take a lesson from the methods
of Queenslanders. In West, Central-West
and North Queensland the stormy season is
welcomed and yet feared, for should the
storms prove dry fire takes its toll. I have
seen 11 fires start up in less than that many
minutes, all caused by lightning. A three-
pronged fork of lightning once struck the
grass 50 yards from me. but a passing scud
put out the flames. On the majority of
Queensland stations not only are Avax vestas
barred, but they are unprocurable at sta-
tion stores. In Avinter some are to be
obtained in tins, and I know of a case where
a man was detailed off to track his own
horse’s hoof-marks over the previous day’s
work because he had reported to the owner
that he had lost a tin of vestas. He found
them too! Mr. Mant says: “Half the fires
ignited by tractors; the other half by care-
less smokers.” Queensland would give it
thus: 80 p.c. lightning; the rest, anything.
In preparation for the annual fires, the
Queensland squatter starts with breaks.
Paddocks are enclosed Avith tracks cut 30ft.
wide. Inside these tracks another 30ft.
break is scored, perhaps 50ft. from the first.
Then torches are applied to the windward
side of either break, and the grass between
the two tracks is burnt out. The result is
a break of 110 ft., a long leap for any grass
fire. Then the paddock is subdivided into
four or eight parts according to size; thus, if
lightning struck a quarter or an eighth of a
paddock, the fire would be confined to that
area. Of course, the lightning might strike
every portion ; at Evesham (Longreacli) last
year fires sprang up like mushrooms as fast
as they Avere extinguished. The manager of
the station was driving about in a car with
an employee when a fire started right on
them. In passing over the flames the hood
ignited, and both men had to receive medieal
attention. When a fire is first noticed miles
away, stations with compasses on. high tow-
ers read the bearing of the fire, and com-
municate with the nearest compass station.
Two bearings are sufficient to locate the out-
break. When the fire-fighters congregate they
take their orders from the property-owner.
Repertory in Melbourne.
Dear Bulletin, —As “Q.Q.” admits (B.
30/12/’26), there has been a good deal of
muddieheadeduess exhibited by the Mel-
bourne Repertory Society, also swelled-
headedness. May not the trouble in which
it finds itself be due as much to the snob-
bishly superior attitude it adopts towards
the professional, or “commercial,” stage as
to its palpably unbusinesslike methods?
In his attempt to give the public “an
authoritative statement as to what the
Repertory movement all over the world
means,” “Q.Q.” cannot refrain from allu-
sions to the “tripe” served up by our theatri-
cal managers and the intellectual inferiority
of the audiences. From people who have
such a guid conceit of themselves one would
expect something above the average in plays
and performance. But what has been
achieved? How have they used their
opportunities? What (to put it bluntly)
have the Repertory amateurs of Melbourne
done to justify their continued existence?
True, their plays have not been “tripe”-
they admittedly start off with an advantage
over the professional stage in that respect—
but what of their acting? Is it not one of
the much-vaunted aims of Repertory to do
away, in the name of High Art, Avith the
star system, and, by way of ensuring a smooth
ensemble and the encouragement of team
work, to give all its players in turn a
chance to appear in leading parts? How
came it, then, that in most of the pieces
staged here one particular actor, as well
as featuring himself as producer, always
claimed the lead? Might not the intellectual
audiences have resented this departure from
Repertory tradition as smacking too much of
the horrid “commercial” theatre? Might
not herein lie one more reason for the gradual
decline in interest.in the society’s doings and
consequent dAvindling of subscriptions and
what “Q.Q.” quaintly terms “gate-money”?
“Q.Q.” speaks of other Repertory theatres
overseas, and lumps those of Manchester,
Dublin and Melbourne together as though
their origin, ideas and policy were identical
—a ridiculous suggestion. Manchester, with
a woman at the head of affairs, made history.
Producing locally-written plays for the most
part, capably played by professional artists
and under professional stage-management, it
had the honor of discovering two dramatists
of special merit —-Harold Brigiiouse, the
author of “Hobson’s Choice” and “Lonesome
Like,” and the late Stanley Houghton, of
“Hindle Wakes” fame. Similarly, the Dub-
lin Abbey Theatre relied, as everybody
knows, on native authors —the list of those
who achieved fame is too long to quote—
and in addition founded its own school of
acting. Compare these things with the
record of Melbourne Repertory, which, in
spite of its highfalutin, has done nothing
for the native author, little, if anything, for
the advancement of its amateur thespians,
and shows by its public statement that, torn
by internal dissension, it is incapable of
managing its own affairs. How could it
expect to live? How can it expect any
sympathy from the despised inferior „ beings
to whom “Q.Q.” now appeals?—Yours, etc.,
Melbourne Playlover.
South Africa’s Problems.
“Bildad” :In stating the case for “the Brit-
ish citizen of dark complexion in South
Africa,” a Bulletin writer (30/12/'26)
opened a large question. He said that the
dark-complected individual is suspicious of
the “Dominion status,” believing that it Avill
place him more under white control, and ‘ lie
has had small reason in the past to trust
the professions of his white rulers.” Also
“recent Nationalist-Labor legislation debar-
ring the Kaffir from many avenues of em-
ployment he used to folio av hasn’t helped to
allay the old distrust.” Still, the boot isn’t
all on one leg. What the white man has
done for most of his colored brethren in
South Africa has been, among other things,
to save them from destruction, to educate
them a good deal, to. look after their health
to some extent, and to keep the peace when
possible. One result is that the 314,000
colored inhabitants of the Cape Province at
the census of 1865 had groAvn to 2,132,000
in 1921. The destruction which threatened the
tribes xvas mostly, of course, from the Zulu
State, which led a tempestuous existence under
five kings, four of them murderers, including
fratricides and several adepts at torture.
The last one, Ceteavayo, satisfied himself
that a man might live three days after his
arms, or even his hands and feet, had been
hacked off provided too many ants didn’t
get to him. These individuals probably had
no better right to rule all South Africa
than the white men had, but they evidently
believed in their destiny, and their standing-
army began the scrap with two surprise mas-
sacres of Boers. After much fighting they
were pushed back by Pretorius and other
Avhite leaders, and there was comparative
peace till the British Government, in one of
its moments of Exeter Hall philanthropy,
recognised Ceteavayo as an independent
monarch, and conferred the “blessings of
freedom” on his people. This was even a
worse break than the one made during the
late Avar, when an Anglo-Australian army,
having chased the Turks and Huns out of
Damascus, received instructions from Chris-
tian folk in London to hand the city,
including its Christian and Jewish population,
over to Arab government. Cetewayo re-
organised the Zulu army, which he found
awkward to handle, for the young soldiers
weren’t alloAv to marry until they had
“washed their spears” in blood, and their
demand to be allowed to shed enough blood
for a big Avash became insistent. At one
time, towards the end of the dynasty, a num-
ber of young soldiers married without per-
mission, and Avhen the king executed the
brides and then executed the brides’ parents
for trying to bury the girls, the tension was
rather increased tijan otherwise. Natal became
overrun Avith refugees escaping from
freedom and independence and Cetewayo,
and was harassed by his black troops break-
ing in to look for the refugees. Finally, he
and his country were annexed. With their
curious streak of .sentimentality, the British
showed much more reluctance to annex the
black savage than the Avhite Dutchman. I
am not one of those who hold that the white
man in all his wanderings did nothing but
evil, but I recognise that there are degene-
rates with that standpoint. I know that the
Arab and the Turk have, between them,
burgled all the world from Vienna to the
sources of the Nile or beyond, and from
India, and beyond India, to the Bay of Biscay,
and butchered a vast amount of European
civilisation in the process. But I find no
appeal in the theory that they should there-
fore be considered the original creators and
innocent aboriginal inhabitants of these parts
or any part of these parts, and that any
white interference or improvement should
prove that the European is a hopelessly bad
lot. I can’t be sure that the more or less
colored strangers who poured into India by
land from the north and north-west, at in-
tervals for 400 or so, have really any
more right to live in the country than the
whiter and much superior visitors who in-
truded by sea from the south. The case of
Maoriland is somewhat similar. The Maoris
Avere “settlers” of comparatively recent date
who built pahs and ate people. Probably
they ate their predecessors. The British
Avere “settlers” of more recent date who also
arrived by sea. They built cities and didn’t
eat people. The missionary is a favorite
butt of the fellow who admires every race
but his own. I have no special interest in
missionaries; still I presume that if no such
species had existed there would be no Pope
at Borne, and no Archbishop at Paris or
Canterbury or Dublin, and no cathedral at
Cologne or anywhere else. The NeAv Testa
merit doesn’t show that the early gospel put
itself in a Avheelbarrow and trundled itself
over the globe.

Meteorology in Queensland.
In the 20-odd years that have elapsed since
the inauguration of the Commonwealth
Meteorological Service, the Government
advances to farmers in Queensland have in-
creased from £94,268 in 1906 to £4,048,069
last year. In the same time meteorological
facilities, for the purpose of making better
known the ragged odds and ends of climate
that Queensland farmers have to work under,
have stood still; regarded from the greater
interests involved, they have actually gone
astern. There also is a growing ten-
dency to lock up such information as is col-
lected in much the same manner as confiden-
tial matter was in war-time. The inevitable
result is that agricultural settlement has
been pushed out in some districts Avith only
rusting railway lines and deserted home-
steads to show for it. The process is still
going on; the great agricultural scheme of
the Government in the Upper Burnett, Cal-
lide and Dawson Valley is being pursued in
districts that have no recorded meteorolo-
gical history worth mentioning. In the
whole of the advertising for this scheme the
only reference to rainfall is the annual
aA'erage rainfall for six stations, of which
but one is actually within the area that is
being settled. Yet expenditure of Govern-
ment loan money Avill be not far short of
£10,000,000, and that of the hapless settlers,
in cash and wasted energy, is beyond reckon-
ing. In dozens of districts during the past
20 years extensive agricultural development
has taken place; yet Queensland had in 1918
a rainfall-recording station for every 641
square miles of territory, against one for
every 141 miles in N. S. Wales, and one for
79 miles in the southern State Avhere the
meteorologist has his headquarters. If the
Queensland stations have been increased
since, the neAvs has been kept from the public
with marked success. There is something
immoral about enticing raw immigrants out
on to grazing land on the strength of annual
rainfall averages, especially in Queensland,
where, owing to occasional cloud-bursts with
long periods of drought in between, this sort
of information is worse than none. Lack
of information as to the distribution of the
rainfall through the crop-growing period,
together with a shameless exploitation of
inviting-looking annual averages, has ruined
thousands of A\muld-be agriculturists, and
explains Avhy it is that recruits for any neAv
scheme have to be brought from afar.
♦
Embattled Bureaucracy.
The most powerful enemy of public economy
in Queensland is a swollen bureaucracy which
finds itself incorporated in the vitals of the
socialist organisation. At the close of the last
financial year the servants of the State num-
bered 48,600, somewhere near 10 per cent, of
the whole adult population. But 43,000
docs not represent the actual A'oting power of
the bureaucracy, which probably runs to
nearly 2| times that number when dependants
and near relations are allowed for. There
are towns and suburbs in Queensland in
which it may be safely said that Government
money in the shape of salaries, wages, pen-
sions, allowances and doles enters into every
second house; hence the politician Avho fear-
lessly and outspokenly advocates genuine
economy in public affairs is up against a
powerful faction indeed. The other day,
shortly after a virtuous “economy” pro-
nouncement fi’om the head of the Govern-
ment, the press contained an announcement
that 37 inspectors under a certain “profiteer-
ing” laAv had been appointed! In the 11
years of the Labor regime the number of
public servants has been doubled and their
salaries brought up to the handsome sum of
over 101 millions, so that every person in
the State is saddled with a load of £l2 10s.
on account of State employees, while the
head of a family (reckoning five to a house-
hold) staggers under a load of £6O. The
railways are the chief source of the mischief.
In 1915 it took 15,000 employees to run the
State lines; to-day 22,000 operate them in
a far less efficient fashion. Only a few days
ago the Government confessed to having put
on over 3500 fresh hands during the last
financial year—in anticipation, of course, of
an election. The Commissioner for Railways
complains with reason of the inroads the
motor-lorry and car are making on his
revenue. To supply the deficiency the
department’s only method is to raise fares
and freights and to talk about saddling “more
of the cost of upkeep on the land” —the hap-
less land that sees a ruined meat industry
apd a half-ruined wool industry staring it in
the 1 , face. The truth is Queensland’s rail-
ways, built as feeders, have degenerated into
bleeders, and her 22,000 railwaymen form an
embattled and disciplined nolitical host pre-
pared to fight to the death for their “rights
and privileges”—meaning thereby no re-
trenchment of any kind, and job control.

The exceptional tonal beauty of the Wurlitzer is a constant source of pleasure
to all lovers of good music, and enthusiasm increases as, year after year, the

The Prime Minister has been a great social
and oratorical success in the Cold Country,
and in talking over large Imperial matters
with other politicians of the Empire he
made a better impression
than any man from these
parts since Deakin's
time. Lately he has been
heard of in his progress
homeward, walking in
his spats on clouds of
rhetoric and glory. Mean-
while his hard-working
deputy, Earle Page,
struggles manfully with
great projects for spend-
ing £35,000,000 on roads
and £20,000,000 on hous-
ing schemes, all in the
old and fairly well-settled
parts of the country,
where there are State
and local authorities to
look after such things.
Speaking recently at
Brisbane, he said that no-
thing so big as his
£85,000,000 road dream
had been dreamed in Aus-
tralia before. Meanwhile
the renewal of building
operations at the south
end of the Transcontinen
tal line is only “expected,”
as it has been for 36
years; news of progress
at the other end hasn't
arrived. for a long time :
and the . two political
giants have given up hope
of keeping their one small
hired ark, or arklet, mov-
ing between Territory
ports with enough regu-
larity to supply the in-
habitants with food and
bring aw r ay produce. It
is strange that men
should be so large and
yet so small; that they
should have so many
spare millions for other
people’s jobs and so few
coppers for their own.

Dear Buileti n, —
Gilbert Mant (B,
23/12/’26), in attribut-
ing half the bush fires to
carbon sparks from the
exhausts of tractors and
the other half to the care-
lessness of smokers, com-
pletely exonerates the
Railway Department. Yet
I think it would be no
exaggeration to say that
hot cinders from railway
engines are responsible
for at least 80 p.c. of all
bush fires. A few days
ago I was standing on
an unattended platform
when a train swept by,
and it started nine fires
in a distance of about
half a mile, the ninth
being on the platform
itself. A cinder had
lodged between two of the splintery old
slabs of which it is built, and the
whole structure, including the goods-shed,
would have gone up in smoke had I not
doused the outbreak with a bucket of water.
A most prolific cause of fires a few years
back was the over-insurance of wheat crops;
I see by the papers that some are still
being insured on a 10-bag basis, and in N. S.
Wales, 10-bag crops are rare. If Mr. Mant
was ever on Burrawang he would know what
the Edolses regarded as their greatest fire-
risk —even after the advent of tractors and
cars. Each train as it passed through was
followed by a horseman, whose job it was
to jump on a fire as soon as it started. This
practice is still carried out on several sta-
tions, and the owners don’t do it for fun.—
Yours, etc., Buttenderry.

An optimistic attempt to solve industrial
problems was made some time ago by
Thomas Shailer Weston, president of the
Maoriland Employers’ Federation. Weston
prophesied an era of falling prices during
the next few years—a prophecy since sup
ported by the Statist and other economic
authorities —and he suggested a sort of indus-
trial Truce of Gou, lasting five years, during
which employers should be pledged to main-
tain wages, and- wage-earners on their side
should promise to abstain from strikes. Wes-
ton reckoned that, with an assurance of peace
and stabilised wage-rates, employers would
be encouraged to improve their methods of
management to an extent which, coupled
with freedom from losses occasioned by dis-
locations of industry, would more than make
up for the drop in prices. The idea has
found favor in the eyes of Australian em-
ployers’ organisations, and it has met with
a most enthusiastic reception from some Eng-
lish industrialists. Havelock Wilson, the
seamen’s leader, is strong for it, and Cam-
mell, Laird and Cos., the shipbuilders, have
been spending good money in propaganda
on behalf of the notion. The old economic
theory that prices depend upon gold supply
PROMOTED.
GRANNIE: “Did you scribble all over the bookcase?”
MICKY: “ Garn! D'you think I’d use a lead-pencil when I’ve yot a new knife?”
lias been weakened since Uncle Sam com-
menced to treat gold like a dangerous tiger,
and the view that prices depend upon wages
and the amount of service given for wages
has gained adherents. If the ranks of Dabor
were as well disciplined as those of the em-
ployers, and if the royal road to promotion
in trades-union circles were not the ability
to convince wage-earners that they are slaves
who have nothing to lose but their chains,
the suggestion might have some chance of
acceptance. Unfortunately for the chances
of the idea in Maoriland, Weston has mixed
it up with Freetrade preachments, and has
thus antagonised the, manufacturers.

“F.A.L.”: The “travelling foremen” of the
Victorian Railways (B. 30/12/’26) have
their counterpart on the N.S.W. system. The
first appointments were made by a Labor
Administration to protect the employees’
interests. When the Nationalists succeeded
to office they increased the number of these
supernumeraries, and the next Labor Gov-
ernment made additional appointments. The
duties originally consisted of seeing that only
those engines that were in proper working
order were put on the road. Gradually this
class of railway men came to be regarded
as officers senior to the drivers, and, to justify
their appointment, were expected to discover
means of cutting down running costs. One
brilliant scheme consists of reducing the
allowance of oil. The saving effected is only
a few pence each trip, while through the use
of insufficient oil the engines run hot and
have to be laid up; and it is calculated that
£5O is lost each day an engine is idle. An-
other superfluous officer travels on the engine
when the newly-promoted fireman makes his
first trip. This man is supposed to teach
the fireman how to fire the engine. But it
is impossible for the fireman to learn the,
work in a few hours, and it is upon the
driver that the task of teaching the fireman
falls. Throughout the service there is at
least one officer to every three men; and it
is twice too many.
“Garry” : No wonder Hugh Denison and
S. M. Bruce find the Americans charming
people. Australia is too good a customer to
be anything else but charming to. One of
the Yankee export journals contains data
showing that the number of cars and trucks
sent to these shores from U.S. and Canada
(the interests in most important instances
are identical) for the nine months ended
last September was 53,951, valued at about
£16,000.000. In addition there were tyres
and parts. The rate of shipment is in-
creasing, too, car and truck shipments for
September totalling 8760, worth close on
£3,000,000. When petrol is added to the
account, motoring in Australia must be worth
anything up to £40,000,000 a year to
America, and there’s quite a lot of stuff
coming over from Old Hingland and not a
few big packing-cases from Mussoliniland.
Y’et there are people who say Australia’s
domestic market isn’t big enough to make it
worth while for Aussies to go into motor
manufacture!
The proceedings of the last Imperial Confer-
ence, which were about as stodgy as the
most conservative of Englishmen could have
wished them to be, were brightened up a
little by American correspondents in Ix>n-
don. These gentlemen, unhampered by any
undue devotion to facts, interpolated quite
a number of harmless suggestions. Even
the Associated Press Bureau sent out a
message that managed to convey, without
actually saying it, that there was a debate
as to whether Eondon ought to continue the
seat of the Imperial Government.. The fact
that Edward P. has a ranch in Canada,
“which he dearly loves,” was used as an
argument for a Canadian centre, and the
situation of Australia between the Pacific
and Indian oceans was cited. as a reason
why this continent might claim to be the
future home of the Windsors. The whole
thing seems to be based on a remark made
by Stanley Baldwin that in some future
age archaeologists might have nothing better
than some old gaspipe and a rusty safety-
razor blade upon which to base a theory that
London was once a fair-sized town. But he
was speaking after dinner, and even Prime
Ministers have been known to be kittenish
after dinner.

“The Listening-Insect”: “Murkaii” (B.
30/12/’26), speaking for beam wireless as
against cables in time of war, cites the sad
fate of Germany’s underwater communica-
tions. But Germany lost command of her
cables because she didn’t have command of
the sea. On the other hand, the main British
system functioned right through the conflict,
and not only carried the enormous military
traffic but the inspiring speeches of W. M.
Hughes and cheap messages between
soldiers and their relatives and girls as well.
From start to finish the business flowed
between London and the rest of the Empire
like a turned-on tap, and one station in
which I< worked never saw the shape of a
clear signal for several years. Everybody
hopes that “Murkah’s” prophecy about the
beam’s conquering sweep will be fulfilled—
there is room for both systems. But nothing
is gained by asserting virtues that cannot
be sustained. Already one big claim, that
the beam would be secret, has been burst—
the substituted claim or apology that modern
codes are undecipherable will cause a smile
to ripple through secret service and crypto-
grammic circles. Also there is no evidence
that the beam can’t be jambed or interfered
with from the air as were the German
stations ; and one cannot imagine the belliger-
ents in the heat of conflict standing politely
aside in the ether and giving each other right
of passage.
“Strict Yeg.” : The Bulletin’s resume
(B. 6/l/’27) of present tendencies was only
wrong, in my opinion, in two particulars.
It gave too much importance to the war as
a cause, and it was too optimistic about
the future. The real cause of our present
“civilisation,” it seems to me, is the flapper.
The flapper earns a lot, and she gets a lot
spent on her. The result is that the entire
community is occupied in showing her ways
to spend it. For one article of use or beauty
in the shops there are ten for the adornment
of the flapper. For one decent hard drink
sold there are 20 made to suit the remark-
able inside of the flapper. For one dish
of wholesome food served there are 20 plates
of rich delicacies served to the flapper. For
one play on which an adult mind can use
its teeth there are a dozen suited to the
immature digestion of the flapper. For one
daily newspaper a grown-up person can
understand there are three suited to the
understanding of the flapper. As the flapper
period of life can neither be skipped nor
hastened, the only remedy I can propose is
to kill the flappers. If this were done thor-
oughly for, say, the next 40 years, the pro-
blem would be solved. Also all other pro-
blems.

“Good Australian”: It makes a fellow-
gorge rise to read a suggestion (B.
23/12/’26) that the Government of Vic-
toria should establish freezing works up-
country to lessen the crushing of animals
and the glut at the Newmarket saleyards.
Why cannot the owners of sheep and cattl
and the meat-merchants and butchers manage
the meat business themselves without ap-
pealing- to the Government for guarantees
and loans? There are plenty of well-to-do
farmers and graziers. Last year four co-
operative meat cos. at Ballarat, Bendigo,
Murtoa and Donald allowed the Govern-
ment to pay £37,100 to bankers under
State guarantees which should never have been
given by the Government to the banks. That
sum was not enough because certain meat
stocks sent abroad for sale on consignment
showed a loss of £B5OO, which the Govern-
ment weakly and wrongly agreed to pay
for these co-operative companies. This is all
set forth in the State Budget. What right
has any Government to guarantee the over-
drafts and pay the losses of a meat-merchant
when it would quito rightly object to
being asked to pay the loans and losses of
a boot-merchant or a tinsmith?

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Lang Government finds the drafting
of a child-endowment scheme “difficult.”
Of course it is difficult. But it needn’t be.
It is all a matter of reducing the basic wage
to the amount necessary to support one
man and one man only. What the wife is
going to do is another matter; but if there
is to be child endowment there ought also
to be wife endowment. To pay a man for
a wife he hasn’t got is quite as absurd as
paying him for either two or three children
he hasn’t got—and that has been the com-
mon rule in Australia for years past: ever
since the system of the basic or standard
or living wage came into force.
In a day or two Westralia will repay a
£2,500,000 3 p.c. loan out of its sinking
fund. Collier and McCallum are so proud
of the achievement that Earle Page will
have trouble in restraining them from bor-
rowing £6,000,000 at 54 p.c. on the strength
of it.
The N.S.W. loan accounts for the second
half of 1926 looked like the Hun army just
before the Kaiser fled to Holland. During
the six months only £3,338,648 of loan money
was collected in London, and the overdraft
climbed to over five millions. Inside Aus-
tralia, though over six millions or so were
wanted, all the money handed up was a little
over two millions. Loan money, in short,
has been going out at the rate of 124 mil-
lions per annum, and not coming in at any-
thing like that pace. That was just like
the cause of the Kaiser’s collapse—-losses go-
ing out fast and victories coming in slowly.
South Aus. is to have its general election
on March 26. The first-past-the-post rule
will obtain, as in 1924, and unless the
Liberal and Country parties come to some
arrangement Labor will surely govern
the State for another three years, and add
another 13 or 14 millions to the public debt.
The central executives of the two parties
have arrived at a cordial understanding, but
some of the Liberal district committees
object, and their attitude may spoil every-
thing. Meanwhile the cordial understanders
are telling one another what they think of
ex-Premier Barwell, now a nominee. Senator,
who could have passed a preferential-voting
law any time between 1921 and 1924 if he
hadn’t been so pigheaded.
Our S- M. Bruce lives in a haze of affa-
bility these days, hence cablegrams like the
following from Canada :
According to Mr. Bruce, the public ownership
methods of Ontario in the development of power
will be applied to Australian problems of the same
kind on his return home. This was a result of his
visit to the plants at Niagara Falls of the Ontario
Hydro-Electric Power Commission.
Ontario includes 41,382 square miles of fresh
water, much of it in rapid motion, and some
of it 1000 ft. or so in depth. In places it
falls in a way calculated to break its neck.
If Bruce, because he has seen things like
this, is coming home in an inspired mood to
harness the Finke or the Cooper with bor-
rowed money, there is awful trouble ahead.
It is to be hoped that he brings Niagara
back with him.
The N.S.W. tax on newspapers is to reach
the High Court—probably sitting in Mel-
bourne —on or about February 21. Chief
Justice Knox very properly declined to deal
with such a constitutional matter by him-
self. As far as can be seen two points
will be taken: (1) that the tax is an excise
duty, and, therefore, not one that a State
authority can impose; (2) that it is an
interference with trade between the States
—that is, if a case can be found where the
tax caused a person in Victoria or Queens-
land to cease to buy, say, the S. M.
Herald. Meantime, as happens in prac-
tically all such cases, the public is paying
more than the tax. The penny papers have
added a ha’penny to their price, and the
twopenny papers have added a penny—a
ha’penny for the tax and most of the other
ha’penny to recoup the agents for collecting
the tax.
The Carinthia, doing a world cruise with
311 IT.S. plutocrats on board, made its first
Australian landfall at Hobart on January
5. Instantly “Mr. W. 11. Rogers, a well-
known Wall-street broker,” spoke a piece:—
If you want to compete for the world’s trade and
to sell your products in the world’s markets, then
scrap your prohibitive Protection to-day. To-morrow
may be too late. How can a prohibitive Protection
create prosperity when you cannot protect the primary
products—the basis of all wealth —which you must
sell on the world’s markets? Prohibitive Protection
is not a British policy. It is an unsound and false
basis of an unsound and false prosperity.
High Protection is not a British policy yet,
but it seems likely to be, and the Yank is
a worried man. For High Protection is
Uncle Samuel’s policy, and lie lias grown in-
decently rich by selling his wares to nations
which were less exclusive than himself. Now
the commerce has grown so one-sided that
other nations also tend to be exclusive, and,
as a consequence, every shipload of U.S.
millionaires that goes abroad tries to con-
vince all and sundry that Freetrade, or a
simple revenue tariff, is a beautiful thing—
for every place except the U.S.
J. Bull begins at last to take a more
cheerful view of the situation, chiefly because
there are 100,000 fewer unemployed than
there were. Britain now levies £33 6s. Sd.
per cent, on imported motor-cars and motor-
bikes and -accessories, on musical instru-
ments, clocks, watches, lace, silk and arti-
THE PUBLIC SERVICE.
“A Commission bas reported that the Vie. Public Service is a tangle of red tape.”

THE MERE TAXPAYEE: “Quite so. And not much right either .”
ficial silk. Imported beer pays at various
rates, the highest being £23 11s. for 3b
gallons. Spirits are charged rather over
£3 15s. per gallon and perfumed spirits £6.
There are duties now on sugar, molasses,
yarn, fruit, matches, milk, hops and lots
of little things. It is expected that after
this preliminary canter the Old Man will
soon be ready to be an avowed Protectionist
instead of a" surreptitious or partly uncon-
scious one. Already Uncle Samuel across
the water remarks on a falling-off in his
great trade boom, and asks if his best milch
cow is going to leave him.
By handing over to the Greater Brisbane
Council almost unlimited powers within its
own area, the Queensland Government
created a new borrowing agency. The Coun-
cil is now pursuing 21 millions at “not more
than 6 per cent.” But for the handy stalk-
ing horse, Queensland might have been driven
to offer 6 per cent, itself.
“Old Parliamentary Hand”: Three Mel-
bourne dailies, more intent upon stunting than
upon stable government, are clamoring for
an early election for the Assembly. They
know that it is impossible for any party
to obtain a majority and that some sort of
a coalition will have to be arranged between
the two non-Labor sections, which are not
yet sufficiently organised. A rush poll with-
out careful organisation will result in a
House as unworkable as the one about to be
buried. But it will take a tax on news-
papers or something equally nauseous to
awake some Melbourne dailies to a sense \.i
responsibility.
One of the Carinthia’s passengers, warn-
ing Australia against the policy that has
made the U.S.A. so rich, says that
High Protection produces “false prosperity.”
But, at the worst, false prosperity seems
more desirable than no prosperity at all,
just as false teeth are better than having
no teeth.
The Worker complains that, in all the
end-of-the-year reviews published in the news-
papers of the Ma State, “not a single capi-
talistic paper pointed out that wages were
lower in N. S. Wales than anywhere else in
Australia, while at the same time it was the
dearest of all States to live in.” And the
Labor Government of the State is imposing
penal taxation on the capitalistic newspapers
that resisted such an obvious gibe!
The State of N. S. Wales makes bricks
—makes close on 50 millions of them in a year,
and sold more than half of them last year to
people who didn’t have to buy them if they
didn’t want to. Most surprising of all is
the information, vouched for by Government
auditors, that there was a profit of just on
£28,000. The Homebush Bay brickworks
have repaid every penny of capital advanced
to establish them, and extensions of plant in
recent years have been financed out of re-
serves. After spending nearly £50,000 on
extensions there remain undistributed sur-
pluses totalling £116,000, reserves of nearly
£Bl,OOO and £17,000 of ready cash. But
alas! there’s a profit-sharing system at work,
involving the devilish principle that if there
are no profits they are not shared.
The business of the N.S.W. Fair Rents Court
grows, but the supply of houses doesn’t. In
1925 the number of heard cases was 573, and
366 rents were reduced. In 1926 the number
was 1046, and 870 rents were reduced. An
outstanding reason for reducing the rent is
that the premises are dilapidated, and when
three families crowd into one house and
pay only one rent,' dilapidation tends to
be accelerated. That increases court busi-
ness, and when all the old residential part of
Sydney is falling down it is possible that all
the rents will be reduced to nothing simul-
taneously. Meanwhile the valuation of the
land goes up, and so do the rates; but the
decencies of life tend to be forgotten through
too many people occupying one room.
The New Year’s strike season opened in
the northern N. S. Wales coalfields on the
day after the holidays. Two Cessnock mines,
Aberdare Extended and Abermain No. 2,
didn’t resume work, the trouble in each case
being due to the flash youths whose employ-
ment is one of the painful necessities of the
industry. At Aberdare the wheelers de-
manded a different variety of electric lamp
to that which they were using. At Aber-
main the clippers wouldn’t start till a griev-
ance some months old had been remedied.
Miners, shiftmen and others lost at least a
day’s work; but the bosses were narked, and
manly independence was asserted, and what
else matters?
Some little time ago Queensland decided
to regulate the profit that the retail trade
might make on imported clothing, and a
schedule set out liow much might be added
to the wholesale landed cost of 56 articles.
The Board of Trade said frankly, that, it
didn’t think its award made much difference,
and that it had no idea how many super-
visors would be required if an effort were
made to keep an eye on 56 kinds of clothing
in all the stores of the country ; but it did
its best. Whether the regulations, which
were booked to operate from the beginning of
the year, will make the buyer demand im-
ported clothes because they are regulated,
and the seller offer Australian ones because
they are not, may appear in time. The
only thing quite certain is the appointment
of some more people for the taxpayers
to pay.

You need not worry about that drop of
£195,350 in income. In 1925 the Austra-
lian business of the New York Life was taken
over and £045,097 was received for reassur-
ance. In the last accounts only £7IS6 came
in under that head. Setting aside reassur-
ance, income to September 30 was £439,560
greater than in the previous year, and
£320,229 of it came from premiums and the
balance (£119,331) from interest, rents, etc.
The National’s enterprise has carried its
business far afield. It is established not
only throughout Australasia, but it writes
policies in Britain, Ireland, India, Ceylon,
S’Africa and the Straits Settlements; also
some solid blocks of insurance were digested
when it swallowed the Australian business
of the Equitable and later the New 7 York
Life. Whether the foreign field does not
add to the cost and cloud the mortality
experience a little is another matter.
New business continues to expand. Last
year £7,763,910 of additional cover was taken
out in 16,547 policies, or £712,000 more than
was written under 15,596 policies for the
previous 12 months. Apart from single pre-
miums and annuities, income from new pre-
miums over the same period advanced
£21,412. The average life policy, though it
dropped £4, is still £459, an amazingly high
figure compared with that of a few years ago.
On the other hand, of course, a £450 policy
is worth no more than one for £250 was 15
years ago. Of the £320,229 increase in net
premium income, single premiums accounted
for no less than £166,169 and renewals for
£148,501. The growing popularity of the
probate policy and the attention given to
group-insurance helped those figures along.
New business is inevitably costly, and just
how 7 much of any year’s exes, should be set
against new policies is an arbitrary matter.
The Wild Cat allows 7 p.c. of premium
income for old (renewal) business and 3 p.c.
for single premium business and sets the
balance of the year’s exes, against new busi-
ness. Results are seen in this comparison :

That means that nearly two-fifths of last
year’s premiums even on new business remain
in the vaults awaiting the time when policies
become claims. Some of the National’s big
competitors cannot show better, while among
some of the young cos. two years’ premiums,
and more, have to be paid out before a penny
can be put aside for policy-holders. Here is
a costs view of the whole business: —
Expenses Compared with Total Income.

The 1925 figures were influenced by the big
reinsurance, that year. Last year’s figure is
remarkably low 7 and enhances bonus pro-
spects. The latter count a good deal in
the fight for new 7 business these days, but the
idea that rates should be reduced is gaining
ground. Claims were heavier last year, but
they were only 43 p.c. of total income com-
pared with 44.7 p.c. in 1924, and mortality
payments were 39 p.c. less than had been
allowed for under that head.
The next table shows what an important
part investments play in the finance of a
big life office :

An increase of £983,551 in the amount of
public securities held and the conversion or
reinvestment of old stock in new gilt-edged
issues at more remunerative interest rates
helped last year’s expansion of £119,387 in
net interest. The office bases its actuarial
calculations on a future net return of 3 A
p.c. : last year, £5 11s. 6d. was actually
realised: —

The surplus earnings over the 34 p.c. paid the
total expenses of the business for the year
and left £120,000 over. With the mortality
margin, this must mean fat bonuses.
Last year’s surplus of £1,975,206, with
£8779 added to the investment reserve,
brought total funds to £24.691,235. There
are, however, some outstanding claims, etc.,
against which, of course, there are assets; so
the total of the latter was £25,452,568, and
the next table shows what they were made
of:—

New buildings in Durban, S’Africa and Gee-
long were completed during the year and
since accounts closed (Sept. 30.) a new pro-
perty in London, adjoining the co.’s Cheap-
side office, has been purchased.
This office is one of the very few that
do no industrial business. Until lately it
was also so old-fashioned as to have only
quinquennial bonuses. They are annual now.
But, much as .the new men in the business
may have desired it. they felt that, having
missed the industrial ’bus, it was no good
chasing it. The society tries to make up
in other ways for what was lost there.

During the previous year the co. bought the
freehold hotels of Fitzgerald’s Castlemaine
Co. on condition that its brewery closed;
bought the beer business of Cohn’s, of Ben-
digo ; and acquired for shares the very profit-
able business of the Melbourne Co-operative
Brewery, Ltd. To begin with, it had taken
over McCracken’s, the Carlton, Victoria,
Castlemaine, Shamrock and Foster busi-
nesses, and subsequently the Geelong Brew-
ery. The 1925 operations complete, the co.
wets the whistle of about two-tliirds of Vic-
toria, and the two-tliirds include the great
majority of those people within the State
whose whistle takes most wetting. The dis-
appearance of the Co-operative’s competition
no doubt reduced exes, considerably and thus
helped to produce the astonishing figures for
the past year. The 1925 transactions in-
volved an increase of capital from £1,100,000
to £1.950,000; but even with £850,000 more
capital to feed the Board saw its way to
raise the dividend 1J p.c. all round, and even
then there was enough left over to have paid
very nearly another 5 p.c.
Nor does it look as though things - were
cut fine in order to show such a profit. On
the contrary, there are evidences that large
provision was made for contingencies :

The goodwill item remains where it was.
notwithstanding that lots of people would
have paid more than eighteen pence for the
businesses acquired. Hotel freeholds have
also shrunk considerably during the year;
and plant, etc., which also shows a reduc-
tion, is certainly much under-valued. One
result is that, though book debts are naturally
larger, cash, investments, etc., are £194,928
more than they were at the 1925 balance.
The position in this respect has changed
as follows during the year :
1925. 1926.
Assets other than goodwill,
freeholds and plant. . .. £1,386,807 £1,598,089
Less liabilities . . . . 375,971 379,881
Net liquids £1,010,836 £1,218,208
Out of the 1925 liquids £108,750 was paid
in div., reducing the total to £902,086. Out
of the 1926 profits £146,250 has been paid ;
add that in. and you get £1,364,458. The
difference between those two t0ta15—£462,372
—is the amount by which the year’s trading
improved the liquid position.
The Wild Cat has no bricks to throw at
the brewery management which steadily
writes down the book value of its plant, etc.,
and piles up a corresponding amount in
more liquid assets. There don’t seem to lie
many dark clouds on the Australian brewery
co.’s horizon at the moment; but after a
period of heavy borrowing and careless
spending, the pendulum is always likely to
swing the other way, and when the Devil
is sick the Devil puts on a surplice. It seems
most unlikely that the Australian public
will ever vote for prohibition ; but the public
is induced to do some queer things some-
times—and, as American experience shows,
some queer things are fastened upon the
public without the public’s knowledge. The
wise brewery management therefore keeps
itself well prepared to at least fight for its
life. In this case, besides holding a good
amount in cash and liquid investments, the
board is building up a very solid reserve
of semi-liquids; and it is probably safe to
say that, even if the bottom fell out of the
beer business to-morrow, the co. would at
least be able to show 255. in the £ of all its
liabilities and share capital. On the figures
as they are presented, and deducting the
£BOO,OOO of goodwill, the net assets are equal
to about 225. per share, prefs. included. But
the market keeps its eye on the 16j p.c.
and the £93,385 of visible surplus for the
year after that fine dividend was paid, and,
putting the probabilities of even larger profits
against the remote possibility of the State
going d_ry, values the shares at 48s. 6d. Even
on a 15 p.c. div. basis, that gives the buyer
£6 3s. 6d. p.c.

So far as the Wild Cat can discover, this
co. has missed only two annual dividends
in its 62 years. It is in the pastoral as well
as the pastoral finance business, its wool
clip last year amounting to 9896 bales, realis-
ing £243,736, as against 7645 bales, realising
£299,909, in the abnormal market of the pre-
vious year. What proportion of the funds is
in one section of the business and what in the
other cannot be ascertained, loans and sta-
tions and stock being lumped together in the
accounts issued to shareholders. So far as
Australia is concerned, the business is wholly
or almost wholly confined to the three east-
ern States, but there are some interests also
in the Argentine. Twenty years back the
directors had notions about clearing out of
Australia altogether; but they soon found
that, after all, the devil they knew had a
good many points in his favor compared with
the devil that took a good deal of expensive
learning. Of course, the co. has had its
knocks and set-backs in Australia. But the
co. has been so long in the business, and lias
been so well advised, that it now expects
and provides for them ; even when it showed
a loss in 1921 it still felt justified in paying
a 10 p.c. dividend. Since then, in four years,
it has shown profits £230,898 in excess of its
dividends; and the latter, with bonus
attached, have averaged only a shade under
15 p.c. Even then there is good reason
to believe that considerable sums have been
set aside to meet contingencies; in fact,
the chairman told shareholders at the
meeting in London that “they had to
reserve large sums out of the year’s general
profit to provide for possible losses conse-
quent on the severe drought in Queensland.”
Notwithstanding those reservations, the
“general profit” was very solid: —
1923. 1924. 1925. 1926.
General profit. £362,885 £412,430 £500,813 £465,768

Net profit . . £177,711 £196,762 £261,184 £230,242
The interest is payable wholly or almost
wholly on debenture stock, £1,900,000 of it
at 4 p.c., the balance at 3 p.c.—very cheap
money which, of course, has its effect on
the profit. The co. does not, however, trade
up to the limit of its resources, as the next
comparison shows: —
1915. 1925. 1926.

Of the cash and public securities, nearly
half a million is in Treasury bonds and
British and Dominion Government securi-
ties. It is a solid old concern, which has
learned about all there is to know of its
business ; and, though its “bonuses” will vary,
the fine backing of visible and other reserves
makes the 10 p.c. just about as sure as any-
thing can be that is based on the pastoral
industry.

Hume Steel, Ltd. (Vic.), a subsidiary
of Hume Pipe (Australia), Ltd., was regis-
tered on October, 1923, to take over patent
rights and processes in the manufacture of
high-pressure steel pipes for a consideration
of £250,000 in fully-paids. For the 12 months
to September 30 last £7OOO was netted after
providing £6OO for depreciation and £1450
for taxation and wiping off preliminary exes.,
£2021. The amounts netted for the two
preceding years were £642 and £36 respec-
tively. The £7OOO resulted mainly from the
completion, in May last, of a 21-year-old
contract with the Melbourne Water Board,
and there was still something owing for com-
mission by sub-contractors when accounts
closed at September 30. The amount should
have been stated. The prefs. come into the
picture for the first time, and a 10 p.c. div.,
which will absorb £5201, has been declared,
payable when funds are available —all cash
at present handy is required to finance busi-
ness.
The co.’s chief difficulty has been a lack
of working capital. Nearly all its money
has been locked up in the Water Board- con-
tract, small orders have left no margin worth
speaking of, and shareholders were not keen
to put more money into the business until it
proved profitable. Of 50,000 “B” prefs.
offered in November, 1924, only 2010 were
taken up. To finance a £189,000 contract
with the South Australian Government
£30.000 in naked debentures were issued in
April last. It was expensive capital, carry-
ing the right to 10 p.c. of the net profits on
the contract in addition to interest at 8 p.c.
p.a. But that is not to say it was bad busi-
ness ; if it results in further contracts, it
may be well worth the price. Balance-sheet
figures show expansion :
1924. 1925. 1926.
Debentures .. .. £30,490
Other liabilities .. £2,372 £17,343 52,867
Freehold and leasehold 2,820 3,975 5,953
Plant . . . . 6,062 17,680 38,788
Stocks . . .. 2,781 7,758 14,789
Contracts .. .. 31,448 23,960 36,002
Book debts . . . . 214 5,433 33,556
Cash and deposits.. 7,319 7,563 13,075
In addition to the debenture issue the co.
was leaning on sundry creditors for £35,524
more at the close of last accounts. Plant,
book debts and deposits on contracts ate up
£54,614 of the new money, and the property
item was £1928 greater. With stocks and
balances owing on contracts in progress there
w 7 ere more or less liquids totalling £97,422
to meet £84,807 of outside liabilities, includ-
ing taxation.
Factories could have been profitably estab-
lished in other States had capital been avail-
able, the board says. Certainly a bigger
turnover that will result in regular contri-
butions to profits is necessary if the prefs.
are to receive regular divs. and a little reserve
strength built up. To finance business that
is offering, shareholders are now invited to
take up the balance of the “B” prefs., 47,990,
and there should be a better response than
there was in 1924. Both classes of prefs.,
by the way, are to be listed on ’Change, and
they advance point for point with the ords.
in any div. the latter receive. With a shade
over 83 p.c. of capital represented by patent
rights there was only about 225. in net tan-
gibles for each £1 of pref. capital paid up
at September 30.

The A.P.A. —H. C. H. Eagar, sec. of the
“defence committee” which is trying to make
radical changes in the management of this
co., writes :
“A well-known business man’s comments (B.
6/l/’27) are very wide of the mark. He states that
“Northam, King and Humpherv are working in
unison.” This is quite true; but at a meeting of
shareholders called by the above gentlemen on
November 16 for the purpose of passing the fol-
lowing resolution, “That the present administration
of the affairs of the association be and the same is
hereby approved,” the motion was lost, not only on
a show of hands, but the proxies were overwhelmingly
against them; so their united action now is simply
for the purpose of defeating the expressed wish of
the shareholders.
Thus, after leaving the matter in the hands of
shareholders, they now refuse to accept that decision,
and have forced the former to requisition for an
extraordinary meeting for the purpose of removing
them. The co-option of Senator Millen by this
discredited board is hard to understand, and the
severest criticism that can be levelled against Millen
is his acceptance of office at their hands.
With regard to the loan in connection with which
charges of bribery were levelled, the “well-known
business man” states that the advance of £7460
has now been reduced to £6404. But as one of the
securities for this loan was the income from an
estate for 4i years at £l2OO per annum, and as
mote than a year has elapsed since the granting of
the loan, the security has decreased in value by
more than the reduction claimed. Thus the security
is worse now than it was 12 months ago. Interviewing
directors individually cannot be justified. Both
Northam and Higgins acknowledged to me prior to
the meeting, and also acknowledged publicly at the
meeting, that they had both interviewed the borrower
previous to the granting of the loan.
The correspondent’s statementthat the def ence
committee did not wish to have the matter of the
L.C.A. purchase discussed is contrary to fact. On
the other hand, Northam’s (the chairman’s) new-
found zeal for probing into the affairs of the L.C.A.
purchase is rather belated, as, although he has been
a member of the board ever since this company was
acquired, and although on his friend’s statement
he knew that far too much had been paid, he has
been quite content to allow it to remain on the
balance-sheet of the A.P.A. at the purchase price.

Wiluna (W.A.) is fast approaching the
producing stage. A mill and roasting plant to
treat 1500 tons of sulphide a month have
been put in, and the present idea is to
instal a bigger plant before the end of the
year. Meanwhile owners of outlying wild-
cats impatiently await a chance to unload.

Chairman Newton Moore lately grieved
over the decay of Great Boulder. Out of
a total output of £14,000,000 nearly half
had been spent in wages, stores, fuel, etc.;
ov&r £6,000,000 had been paid in divs., the
great bulk of it to shareholders outside the
State. Increasing costs and decreasing grade
has crippled the Golden Mile. East year
Boulder obtained £246,000 from 107,80 S
tons and showed a profit of £2244; in 1902
it put 104,000 tons through the mill for
£514,000 and earned a profit of £264,350.
In other words the value of the ore decreased
from 20dwt. to lOdwt. and costs practically
doubled.

A note from Gordon Lyon re the Sand
Queen-Gladsome float: —
Speaking of the syndicate that took the properties
off the W.A. Government’s hands, the “Wild Cat” says:
“It (the syndicate) will pocket 16,000 paids and
£6500 for passing the shows on.” If the inference
is that the mines were a burden which the Govern-
ment was eager to get rid of, it Is wrong; the real
fact is that, of the £5600 cash mentioned, nearly
£4500 of it has to be paid to the Government for
the properties. This makes a very material differ-
ence in the so-called “passing on” process.
Of course it does. The flotation, by the
way, is a private one, the purchasing syndi-
cate, in effect, turning itself into a N.L.
company, doing its own underwriting, and
thus making its members responsible for
taking up the whole of the shares without
any public hawking or bright boost to attract
the support of the public at large. The syn-
dicate is satisfied to allow the mines to prove
their own worth by results, as they have
done in the past, their production to date
being gold worth £710,553 from 202,419 tons.
The work of re-opening and re-equipping
them is now in full swing.

Glenelg Hills field (W.A.) is mostly
shepherded, and the Warden has issued a
warning that unless leases are worked they
will be forfeited. Some of the finds in this
locality look promising. One, according to
the inspector of mines, is in country which
is not auriferous. The settlement around the
Glenelg Queen has moved from the tent,
humpy and waterless stage to a small mostly-
galvanised township with post office, store,
good water supply and the prospect of a
large-sized pub at an early date. Dorric
Hoolette’s old prospecting partner, Charlie
Nortlimore, w T ho is doing well wheatgrowing
43 miles west of Glenelg, recently left his
reaper and binder to give the dolly and
dish another trial, and seems to have struck
something promising in the Great Beacon
two miles east of Glenelg Queen. So far
lode-cap values range from 10 to 40 dwt.
per ton over a length of 80ft. Borneo Oil
Syndicate has secured an interest in this
show and intends to give shareholders an-
other run for their money. Northmore has
been offered the cash necessary for working
capital for a share in the property, so there
is apparently money available for promising
finds on this new field.
Westralian Mines Department has recently
made advances to numerous parties potter-
ing about old shows in the hope of effecting
resurrections. One or two may be raised
from the dead, but the chances of the others
appear hopeless. As The Bulletin has
often said, it is questionable whether any
improvement of the Westralian gold-mining
industry can be expected from a policy of
throwing good public money into out-back
waterholes. Better to spend it in search of
new reefs and lodes.

“Peter”: Westralian Goldfields Water
Scheme, which cost £3,000,000, has just been
paid for out of Bigjohn Forrest’s sinking
fund, and Perth is crowing over the fact. The
metropolitan water schemes could be paid for
similarly if consumers were charged half the
price for water that goldfielders had to pay.
Consuming up to 70,000 gallons daily, I
was charged ss. 9d. per 1000 om the
fields, and was not permitted to use
mine water for ore treatment. Other mines
were charged up to 10s. per 1000. Coastal
folk are charged Is. per 1000, and squeal like
stuck pigs if they are not served with crystal
liquid. While the mines were charged from
ss. to 10s. for large quantities, cockies were
charged only 2s. 6d. per 1000, though taking
but a few hundred gallons daily—good luck to
them, for in those days cockies wanted all
the help offering! Now that the tables are
turned and cockies are rolling along in
motor-cars while prospectors are padding the
hoof, what about increasing the price to
cockies with a corresponding decrease to
the mining industry? And, if city folk
think that paying off the goldfields scheme
by sinking fund is such a fine thing, what
about charging them a price that will pay
off their own schemes in the same way?

Golden Horseshoe board says “onerous
conditions imposed on the Westralian mining-
industry” necessitated closing down the mine
in June last, and managing-director Prothero
Jones, who visited the West a few months
later, “found it impossible to come to an
understanding with the State Government to
enable the co. to restart work.” The report
gloomily adds that last year’s operations
resulted in a loss of £37,252.

The two engineers who are represent-
ing the corporation which is expected to
finance Mt. Isa if their reports are satis-
factory have arrived in Australia. Shares
have moved up briskly—it is assumed that
the co. wouldn’t have taken 50,000 shares
for a start if it hadn’t been satisfied with
the reports already available. Actually
there is not much in that argument, because
the co. had every reason to expect a rise_ as
soon as it got busy, so that it wasn’t risk-
ing much in taking a comparatively small
block. There is far better justification for
the movement in the admirable developments
in the mines.

There has been great delay over the amal-
gamation of Isa Mines and Isa Prop. An
agreement was made about the middle of
last year for the sale of the Prop, to Isa
Mines for 125,000 shares in the latter; and
both cos. formally consented. But they were
afterwards advised that the business hadn’t
been put through as the N.S.W. Companies
Act requires, and the confirmation of the
sale has to be done all over again. By the
middle of next month things should, how-
ever, be about ready for a distribution of
the 125,000 shares among Isa Prop, scrip-
holders.

Mount Ida Manganese has started work
at Bald Hill, near Heatlicote. one of the
most remarkable regions geologically in Vic-
toria. The co. has bought part of the con-
centrating plant of Costerfield Antimony,
now defunct. The body has been proved
by open cut to 50ft.. and is believed to make
a solid formation down to 200 ft. These
measurements will give 33,000 tons of high-
grade manganese ore. But the demand at
the moment in Britain and America is slack.
New White Crystal. Ardlethan (N.S.W.),
still dredges the pockets of holders of its
50,000 of so live shares in order to keep the
battery going. The eleventh call of 6d. fell
due this week, and some of the shares are
now 7s. lid. paid (10s. nominal), but about
100,000 out of a total of 150,000 have fallen
by the way. Since the overhaul of the plant
seven months ago, 53f tons concentrates have
been won and realised £9060. About £450
worth, remains unsold, the balance of the
three weeks’ work to - Dec. 18. Creditors
were owed £459 at the end of the year, and
the bank account showed £976 overdrawn;
hence the call. The co.’s circular says that
HOewt. of concentrates will be won weekly,
worth £420, against £335 of outgo. That is
putting the best face on it, and does not
leave much margin for slips. A new tailings
dam is being excavated, and a new dynamo
installed to carry the added burden on the
electrical plant. New pumping gear to cope
with requirements of the tables is in posi-
tion, and the mine is well ahead of the
schedule of supplies. It is now or never
for Crosby's Ilill. whose A p.c. stuff may
be profitable if tin keeps about £3OO.
The directors of Guinea Gold, a Bulolo
flotation which occupies several leases said
to be outside the disputed area, have re-
ceived a radio message to the effect that
107 oz. gold was cleaned up in eight
days on one lease, making gold already to
hand 1650 z. The show is a dredge and
sluice concern, and recently reported th >
purchase of a modern sluicing plant.
Whether this is yet in use is not stated,
and there is equal vagueness as to cubic
yardage treated, and value of gold re-
covered. One hears of prospects going
455. 3d. and 535. fid. per c.y. The odd pence
convey a fine air of verisimilitude. The
matters of yardage treated, approximate
costs, etc., are overlooked —conveniently, it
may be.
Federated Tin Mines, Ltd., is a London
float to take over the South Heemskirk
(Tas.) property of Federation Tin, N.L.,
which has been under offer for a long time.
The new co. is in 200,000 £1 shares; 110,000
offered. The promoters figure working capi-
tal a't £OO,OOO after meeting preliminary and
underwriting exes., etc. To shareholders in
the old co. the deal is worth about 2s. per
share in cash, together with 90 fully-paids in
the London co. for every 100 shares held.
Ore reserves have been estimated at about a
million tons.

Only five Bendigo mines were productive
last year—Hercules ; New Red, White and
Blue; Ironbark, South New Moon and
Carlisle, the last now shut down. The year
was the poorest ever. From IS7I to 1907
good profits were made. During the last
20 years only five show a profit in divs. over
calls. In 56 years 1918 was the only year
without a divvy. Bendigo has raised over
625 tons of gold, or 20 million oz., worth
£81,626,024. And the old city is very ener-
getic still. 11. M. Leggo is pushing a
scheme to plant tobacco on the deserted
mining areas, and the city draws trade from
the whole northern district up to the Murray.

More Malayan tin returns are in for
December and, with one exception, they are
not rosy. Kamunting, an exceptionally well-
equipped show, has put through 267,000yd5.
for 95 tons of oxide, on a very long run. Phin
Soon got close on 20 tons; Ronpibon also got
20 tons out of 85,000yd5., but it took 512
hours to do. Taking the situation gener-
ally, it is hard to avoid the impression that
either a good many of the dredges aren’t
doing the work that was claimed to be within
their capacity, or the ground isn't weighing
up to the borer's estimates. The latter is
probably the explanation in most cases where
there is something wrong.
“M.E.”: Some of the monthly yardages
reported by Malayan dredges are extraordi-
nary. It is hard to believe that Ulu Yam
dredge, with a close connected bucket band
of 61ft., can dig and treat 130,000 yards
in a month. In other words, the co. claims
that hour in and hour out the average
bucket is nine-tenths full, for be it remem-
bered reported yardages represent ground
in the solid, which occupies consideraWy
more space after being dug, i.e., in the
buckets. On a similar dredging factor
Malim Nawar South’s 12ft. buckets w r ould
handle over 200,000 yards a month, and
liawang, whose highest extraction in a 606-
hour month was 130,000 yards, should, with
its 81 cubic ft. buckets, have a monthly turn-
over of at least 150,000 yards.
Bundi Tin Dredging recovered seven tons
oxide in the last half of December from
20.000 c.y. in 250 hours. Floods arrived
and damaged the works, but both dredges
are reported to be safe. One of the co.’s
difficulties has been high treatment costs,
8.58 d. in its last fiscal year; this is attri-
buted to the limited capacity of the present
plant. But that difficulty should disappear
when the Dutchmen deliver the new dredge,
fitted with jigs and classifiers, and with a
guaranteed capacity of 144,000 c.y. per
month. It is expected to be at work about
April. The highest point touched by the
scrip last year was 665.; now about 475.

Randolph Bedford goes north this month
on behalf of the Commonwealth Malaya Co.
to treat with the owners of some areas which
E. J. J. Rodda, the co.’s field representative,
has under option. The co.’s shares have
hitherto been of £5O each: they are now
being turned into pound shares, and will
presently be listed.
* * * *
The dredge for Haddyai Tin is on the way.
It has a capacity of 120,000 c.y. per month,
and recoveries of 60 tons oxide are expected.
Everything being ready on the property,
dredging should commence about seven
months after the plant’s arrival. The co. is
one of Malay-Siamesc Prospecting pups, and
paid £70,000 cash and £85,000 in fully-paids
for the dredge, 235 acres mining leases and
1056 acres held under prospecting licenses.
Boring results averaged 1.271 b. per c.y., and
assays showed the oxide to be worth 74 p.c.
Twyford Malayan Tin, one of the numerous
new Australian flotations, has an option
over an area in Ivantang—the place is called
Gunong. C. J. Rowe has reported by . cable
that he has commenced check boring. Heavy
rains have stopped him, but the eight bores
so far put down average 20 feet, and are
showing 14oz. per c.y.
It looks as if “Tiger” King will need all
his nerve and skill in his job of taming those
unruly cubs, Pliin Soon and Nawng Pet.
Phin Soon is not doing well on an output
of 20 tons per month, with tin at £3OO
per ton. The Pet has not been producing for
the last 12 months, and the finances must
be feeling the strain. Shareholders are wait-
ing for Seale’s report, which should show
them exactly where they stand.
Straits Tin, with a capital of £25,000, is
an addition to the list of Malayan pros-
pecting cos. W. A. Anderson is chairman
and James Reid Pebderdy, late of Alluvial
Tin, is managing director in Malaya. “Peb”
worked for years for the late John Moffat of
Irvinebank, and has had three years with
Newman and Pratten.

a personally-conducted party on a Manly

his donation of five guineas, and paused dra-

the thrift of the publican’s 15-year-old son,
who, it appeared, had quite a big deposit in
the savings bank. The information came as
a surprise to Bung, for the lad was only
allowed a few shillings a week pocket-money.
Investigation disclosed that the lad had
quite a nice connection of outside customers,
who were always ready to buy grog at half-
price, the supply being drawn from dad’s
cellar. As the former postmaster was a
temperance preacher who was not on friendly
terms with the publican, the youth’s finan-
cial operations had remained a close secret.
There is one account less in that office now.

The magician, it appeared, had been ordered
by the Government to hand over a pig to
the husband as damages in the matrimonial
cause. Having none of his own convenient,
and having a perverted sense of humor, he
stole one from the husband. That was too
much altogether: the husband at that stage
took his tomahawk and did justice with
his own hands.

“Phil L.” : Finkelstein
watched the progress of the
new building with joyful satis-
faction. “T wel v e lofely
storeys"'—and he owned the
vacant block adjoining. His
joy was the result of a dis-
covery he had made when the
new foundation was laid, and
week by week he had watched
the building creep skywards;
now the roof was going on,
and his patience would be
rewarded. For lie had dis-
covered that the new build-
ing encroached lin. upon his
land. Had he made his dis-
covery known earlier there
would have been no encroach-
ment ; but now they would
have to pay his price. The
news threw the builders and
owners into a furious panic.
Surveyors, architects and
owners protested, cajoled and
argued, just as Finkelstein
had expected, and finally sug-
gested that he sell them the
lin., adding that the market
value would be £lOO at the
outside. Finkelstein replied
that he did not wish to sell—
he greatly liked that inch-
hut perhaps £2OOO might
tempt him. High as his
figure was, Finkelstein felt
sure that he would receive it.
Did it seem like opening his
mouth too wide ? Not at all, for
what else could they do but
pay his price? He flatly de-
clined to accept less, and all
counter-suggestions found him
obdurate. He heard nothing
more for some weeks. Then
one morning workmen
appeared and began to chisel
off the encroaching brickwork
and plaster, and Finkelstein
received a final offer of £2OO.
"Sheer bluff,'’ thought Finkel-
stein—he wouldn’t take under
£2OOO. His bluff was called,
for, expensive and laborious
as it was. they chipped the
entire wall, and the incident
closed. When Finkelstein
built on his block, he natu-
rally put his wall hard up
against the late encroachment,
and he builded well and
solidly. “Ten lofely storeys.’’
When his structure was com-
pleted, the news was borne to
him that his building en-
croached lin. And so it was.
For they had chiselled off 2in.
He couldn’t chisel his en-
croachment off, and after much
pleading and cajoling he was
permitted to pay a mere £3OOO
for that inch.
“Narara”: Methodism was
the prevailing denomination
on the Lower Hawkesbury
(N.S.W.) when I was a boy,
and a very robust creed it was.
Owing to the scattered popu-
lation, most of the services
were conducted by local
preachers. In one tiny village
there were tw o of these divines,
and jealousy ran high between them. They
used to take “service" alternately, and the
preacher seldom neglected an opportunity of
getting in a sly dig at his rival. I was in
the chapel one Sunday night when the
younger of the pair in charge. He led
off with. “O Lord, Thou knowest how
incapable and unworthy Thy servant is.”
This was too much for the other theologian,
who was among the congregation. “Amen,
Amen !” he shouted in stentorian agreement.
“C.Q.”: What exactly is the rule that
governs anonymity in the medical profession?
The other day a Collins-street nose-and-
tliroat specialist extracted a peanut from a
four-year-old youngster's lung. The success-
ful operation is regarded in sawbones circles
as something of a marvel, made possible only
by a new discovery in radiology, but the
paper which got the story was asked not to
publish the surgeon’s name. Yet when a boy
cut his foot on a Port Phillip beach a few
days later the physician who put in the
necessary stitches was solemnly identified.
“Canar": Touching quick rescues at sea
(B. 30/12/’26). If I should ever fall over-
board I trust it may be from a
steamer, where it is simply a matter
of signalling the engine-room to have
the craft stopped and a boat can be lowered
in no time. On a sailing-ship a number of
complicated operations, depending upon the
wind and the sail carried at the time, may
be necessary before a boat can even be
lowered ; after that several hours may pass
before the vessel is able to return and pick
it up again. In 1906, while the barque
Arctic Circle was between Newcastle
(N.S.W.) and Valparaiso, the carpenter fell
overboard about 2 p.m., and, although a
lifebuoy was at once thrown to keep him
up, it was nearly five before he was back on
board again. While the sailing-vessel
Colonial Empire was in the Indian Ocean
one of the crew fell overboard, and nearly
four hours passed before the boat which
rescued him was picked up again. In both
these cases the job of getting the ship’s boat
away OCCU P ie( I only a short time, but that
° f - ett j back a f ain was a ma «er of hours.

which was stolen from the court-room while
tl le Court was sitting (B. 30/12/’26) re-
minds me that in Sydney a city jewellery
fir™ had a showcase in the vestibule of a
leading hotel, the value of its contents being
estimated at several thousand pounds. One
day a prompt, business-like young man,
accompanied by a person in overalls, arrived
and proceeded to superintend the removal of
the case by his dungareed assistant. When the
manager of the hotel came on the scene, the
young man presented a card bearing the name
of the firm which owned the case, and ex-
plained that it was proposed to replace the
jewellery with more up-to-date exhibits. The
THE HOLIDAY SEASON.
“Two more N.S.W. Ministers are to take a trip to England.”
LANG: “There’s plenty of room for you all, but don’t push! Just fall in in a queue.”
two chatted while the case was removed to
a car waiting outside. Subsequently, of
course, it was discovered that the polite
young man was an impostor. But that isn’t
quite the end of the story. The contents of
the case were all paste, worth at the most a
few pounds, a fact known previously to only
the manager of the jewellery firm.
“Coot”: “Bao-dah” (B. 30/12/’26) need
not have gone as far as Singapore for his
story of the theft of a clock from a court-
house while justice was being administered
there. One day, whilst cases were being
dealt with in the old Melbourne Police Court,
a man entered with a ladder, and, putting
it up against the rear wall, quietly removed
the clock, and walked off with it. Nobody
dreamed of interfering, the impression being
that he was acting under instructions from
authority. Another, or perhaps the same
man, subsequently entered the office of the
Chief Commissioner of Police in Russell-
street, and did precisely the same thing.
* * * *
“Feng-Shui”: The modernist movement is
making good mileage in Japan. Two thous-
and Buddhist nuns recently rose in revolt
and announced their intention of letting their
hair grow long. The shocked hierarchy re-
plied that the thing could not be allowed —
why, the next step would be a demand for
husbands ! The revolting ladies replied that
that was precisely what they wanted, be-
cause. as they pointed out with engaging
frankness, they “experience the same feel-
ings as do the priests and all other people.”
Also they remarked that many of the priests
who once were celibate now take wives, and
that the change was introduced on the same
grounds—that priests were men and that it
was cruel and illogical to deny them man’s
rights and privileges. Time was when the
iconoclasts would have been roughly silenced,
but Japan these days has a Parliament and
the vestal virgins are bringing pressure to
bear on the politicians to get their wish.
Further intensification of Nippon’s immigra-
tion problem may therefore be expected.
* * * *
“Dixie” : I know three girls who have kept
their long tresses, after being shingled, for
use as night hair at dances and theatres.
Possibly this is one of the advantages of
being a woman. The senior member of our
office staff had long hair. One day she had
it bobbed, and apparently the result was
regarded by her as unbecoming. Anyhow
next day she came to the office with her hair
coiled over her ears as usual. Her shorn
tresses and a hair-net had done the trick.
Another young lady of my acquaintance has
auburn hair; it was thin and scraggy, and
she had it bobbed. Her mother, whose hair
was of the same shade but very thick, was
shingled at the same time. Now when the
sweet young thing goes out o’ nights she
wears mother’s hair.
“S.C.”: One of the oldest graveyards on
the South Coast of N. S. Wales is that be-
side the main road, near the little town of
Pambula —Pamboola in the abo. tongue. Some
notabilities sleep there: Matthew Adam
Munn, of Maizena fame, described in gilt
letters as “a native of Scotland,” lies be-
neath an obelisk of polished granite, and a
hoary tombstone near the entrance gate is
inscribed “John Alfred Windeyer, of Bib-
benluke, Maneroo.” John w r as a relative of
Judge Windeyer, and assumed the manage-
ment of Bibbenluke station on its purchase
by William Bradley, of Goulburn, from Ben
Boyd's Twofold Bay Company. But what
interests me most is that the iron railings
around one ancient tomb are set in their
stone paranet with molten sulphur. Lead
was too scarce a commodity in the early
days to be spent on tombs. They were care-
ful folk; around the; grave of a child the
sides of an old iron cot do as rails.

“Canar”: Round pegs were forced into
square holes with an official perversity no-
thing short of amazing during the military
occupation of German New Guinea. Troops
on arrival in Rabaul were drafted to the
main garrison, and from there they w r ere later
detailed to jobs in the administrative ser-
vices ; a non-com. doin? the detailing. Thus
it came about that at one time the second
utate of one of the Government-owned
schooners was a clerk, while a mariner with
a first-mate’s certificate added up figures in
one of the departmental offices. A former
draughtsman was dispensing at one of the
hospitals while a fully-qualified pharmacist
was a subordinate in the harbor-master’s
office. The strange thing about it was that
everybody seemed to get along all right, and
accidents and mishaps were few.
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: “Black Tracker’s” lady
tramp (B. 30/12/’26) reminds me of an
identity of the Dubbo-Cobbora road
(N.S.W.) about the beginning of the cen-
tury. For just on 15 years her beat was
between Dubbo and Cobbora, and she seldom
remained more than a day at either end. Her
husband, a hawker on this road, had been
burnt to death one night when sleeping under
his van. The shock turned his wife’s brain,
and she took to the road in search of him.
She would accept food or monetary assist-
ance, but not even in the worst weather
would she accept offers of a lift or of shel-
ter. She was always ready to do any odd
job and never worried if she was paid for it
or i.vi, Eventually they found her lying
dead, a few yards off the road, clutching a
battered old billy in her hands.
“Hop B.”: The ship’s sur-
geon on a 8.-P. steamer
a restless person, always devis-
ing new ways of passing the
long hours in the tropics. One
day he announced that he had
discovered a champion sprin-
ter, a huge cockroach, which
inhabited a crevice under the
washstand. Assuming the
role of McShortodds, the sur-
geon charged punters Is. for
every attempt to stalk and
slay the parasite, the prize
offered for success being a 10s.
Solomon Island note. Every-
one, from the captain down,
had a try; the operator would
lie for perhaps half an hour
motionless on the doc.’s bunk,
folded newspaper raised, until
the insect Carbine warily ap-
proached the bait —a few
breadcrumbs. The slightest
movement of body or news-
paper sent the wily one to his
lair like greased lightning,
and after a week of the sport
the doe. announced the tak-
ings to be nearly a fiver, with
the cockroach still as good as
new. It remained for the
second engineer, a sagacious
Scot, to finally annex the
prize. He discarded the news-
paper for a bicycle pump, and
blew the sprinter into the
water in the wash-basin, where
he was an easy victim.
“Herodot”: Luck? Or
what is it? A crowd of kids,
trespassing on railway pro-
perty in a Melbourne suburb,
picked up an unexploded
detonator. Not knowing what
it was, they threw it down
on the ground, hammered it
with a piece of wood and
twisted the metal portion of
it, all without result. Then a
man who had been used to
explosives most of his life
came along, and, recognising
the deadly thing, took it from
the youngsters. Instantly it
exploded, mowing all the fin-
gers off the hand that held it.

“2616”: The smartest
rescues at sea (B. 30/12/’26)
are performed on ships of the
Navy. One boat is always
swung out in readiness, and
near the stern are two patent
lifebuoys, one on either side,
in each of which is a blue
light and a tot of rum. Be-
tween these two buoys a
sentry patrols ceaselessly.
When H.M.S. Mildura was
steaming at 10 knots in the
Arafura Sea an A.B. fell over-
board one night. The alarm
was given, the sentry dropped
the starboard lifebuoy and
then got away smartly in the
boat. The A.B. was rescued
and came aboard muttering
moodily, “No rum.” The
sentry, thirsty soul, had seen
to that. The boat was hoisted
and the ship under way within 11 minutes
of the alarm being given.
LAST WEEK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The blue lagoon was bluer
And the sky was bluer still,
The sun rose twice as easy
From behind the slanting hill;
The grass was growing greener
Down beside the shady creek
When we wakened in the morning—
Or the afternoon—last week.
The pretty girls were lovely
When we met them on the beach;
It was easy throwing down a plum
When one could pick a peach.
We played the dickens with them
Even we, the mild and meek—
When outside our home dominions
On the sunny days last week.
The nights were filled with magic,
And the darkness wove with bliss,
The rain showers melted sweetly
In the wonders of a kiss.
When the lips were different every night
The hours were never bleak ;
For our spirits took some damping
In the darkest hour last week.
But it’s strange how circumstances
Alter cases in a day;
Because last week is over now
The brightest sky is grey;
And the girls all seem like sisters,
By the color of the cheek ;
Yet it’s just the same old powder
That those girls had on last week.

“Minnie M.”: On Boxing Day I met an
acquaintance who hails from Scotland. When
I asked if he had had a merry Christmas, he
shook his head doubtfully. “Weel, lass,”
he said, “I thocht sae yesterday, but I’ve
never been able to go out Boxin’ Day before,
so I’m no sae sure.”

“Chloe”: The Timorese branch of the
Malayan peoples have kept well ahead of
European scientists in some matters. For
centuries the medicine-men have used a cer-
tain herb to ensure sterility in the female,
should it be deemed undesirable for her to
have offspring. The people reach a high
standard in physical fitness, and though the
Timorese are not a big race the symmetry of
the body is so perfect that no one seems
small. Neither has the small archipelago
ever been over-populated. Timorese Sairy
Gamps also practise birth-divination. The
expectant mother pays a visit of ceremony as
soon as she knows her condition, the wise
woman, receives her with mystic rites, makes
much incantation, with burning of spices
and herbs, and after a day or so declares the
sex of the coming baby. A Dutch doctor of
Koepang told me that after 20 years’ experi-
ence and close observation he has never
known a prophetess to be wrong in a forecast.

MERRY MOTOR SALESMAN (to flapper awaiting friend

“Wang”: The Australian parson doesn’t
always receive his wedding fees in currency.
Not long ago a young cocky up near Bal-
larat asked the clergyman who had tied the
knot if he would accept potatoes in pay-
ment of his account, and the offer was
accepted. Another chap I knew, a strug-
gling young farmer, paid up his dues in fire-
wood. The parson in this case drove a
bargain—he would accept the firewood only
on the condition that it was cut into short
lengths. But the limit in my experience
was reached by a rabbit-trapper, who offered
to keep his reverence supplied with fresh
rabbits for 12 months if lie would read the
marriage service over him. I don’t know
whether the' parson was a vegetarian, but
he turned down the proposition as coldly as
GETTING IT BOTH WAYS.

“lan C.” : The death of a member of the
Hutcheson family at Kyneton (Vic.) recalls
the story that used to be told of a relative,
a Scot also. The pony bolted with the
buggy in which his wife was sitting. A
releegious mon, the husband lifted up his
hands and prayed “God save Hannah!” By
some means Hannah managed to fall with-
out hurting herself seriously, and the gee-
gee kept on galloping till all he had attached
to him was portion of the shafts. The rest
of the four-wheeler was in bits along the
track. “Ah, if I only had had the sense
to add ‘and the buggy’ to Hannah!”
Hutcheson murmured.

“Tidapali”: A cable from Warsaw
describes how thieves tunnelled under a
street to get into a bank. I
know of the same thing
being done for a legitimate
purpose. A relative of mine
was manager of the Bank of
London and liiver Plate in
Buenos Ayres, where the old
streets are the narrowest
imaginable. Banco d'ltalia,
on the other side of the
thoroughfare, got into diffi-
culties, and a run was
started by its depositors one
Saturday morning. After
closing-time the manager
begged my relative to help
him tide over the crisis. The
request was granted, and
this was the plan evolved. A
selected body of men, mostly
English, began a tunnel in
the yard of the London and
River Plate Bank, and drove
it across the 30ft. street
about 15ft. below the sur-
face. It was only big
enough for one man to pass
along at a time on hands
and knees. On Monday
morning there were about a
thousand depositors sitting-
outside the Banco d’ltalia;
they had been waiting from
noon on Saturday to draw
their money. As fast as they
were paid in gold they took
it across- to the English bank
and paid it in. A clerk was
sent down the winze to take
the gold back to the Italian bank, and the
process continued all day till the run was
stopped.
“Spur”: The Sydneyite is unquestionably
suspicious of strangers bearing gifts (B.
30/12/’26). I was walking along George-
street when thirst assailed me, and I cast
my eyes about for a drinking partner (I
had just arrived from Dubbo, where we
despise the .Timmy Woodser). I had some
difficulty in finding the sort of man I wanted :
some looked too wowsery and others just
the opposite. At last I made my choice of
one whom I decided was of the race of good
fellows. “Sir.” I said, “excuse me, but
would you care to join me in a glass?” The
man glared very hard at me. He began at
my eyes, and carefully surveyed me down
to my boots and up again. Then he
walked away without a word. What is the
use of being a regular churchman, lodge
officer, respectable citizen and model hus-
band if that is all it earns you? I went
into the nearest pub, shouted for the bar-
maid, and had the devil of a time.

“Autopsy”: Practically half the Victorian
Lunacy Act (1915) is concerned with the
various duties and regulations appertaining
to the Master-in-Lunacy, the official cus-
todian of all patients’ property and estates.
A variant of his title is Master-in-Equity;
and this, perhaps from the normal repug-
nance to the word “lunacy,” the present
Master usually adopts. Naturally a man
whose powers of attorney are practically un-
limited is subject to severe criticism as to the
manner in which he disposes of patients’
business: and many of these unfortunates
seek retaliation by addressing him in their
letters of protest as the Master-of-Iniquity.
“McDuff” : There
is one scared boy
living in a South
Melbourne suburb
who is off the
fascinating game of
hide-and-seek for
ever and ever. The
other day he and
a little girl of five
were among a
party of young-
sters engaged in
the pastime. The
boy, desirous of
hiding the young
lady where she
would not be found
easily, picked her
up and hung her
on a hook sticking
in the side of a
wall, and covered
her over with an
overcoat. She
promptly started
kicking, and with
the laudable desire
of screening her
from the child who
was “he,” the boy
grabbed her legs,
and, holding them
tight behind his
back, stood in
of the overcoat.
Presently, when
“he” had “given
up,” the lad pulled
the overcoat off
the mite, and went
to lift her down.
He was only just
in time. Somehow
the strain had
shifted to the back
of the neck of her
dress, and she was
all but dead.
“The D.” : Took a nephew of mine, aged
six, on a country jaunt in W.A. We struck
a camp of abos., and it was anent the female
of this species that the little chap sought
information, in the usual inquiring spirit of
youth, when we were seated in a crowded
railway carriage on our homeward journey.
He had not seen an abo. woman before
“Uncle,” he asked, “did that lady we saw
blacken her face?” “No,” I replied. “That’s
her natural color —she is an Australian abo
riginal.” “And is she black all over?”
queried the kid. “Yes, black all over,” was
my reply. “Gee, Uncle, you know every-
thing, don’t you?” said the young demon
admiringly.
“Hamer”: It is just 50 years ago since
the village of Manly grew big enough to
be proclaimed a municipality; and crackers
to celebrate the jubilee are being let off
this week in the place where the permanent
population of 25,000 is liable to be swollen
to over six figures on holidays. It is 73
years since Henry Gilbert Smith started
the first ferry service between Manly and
Sydney with the little 12-ton steamer The
Brothers; before that the inhabitants rowed
to Sydney when they wanted to get there.
The Parramatta Ferry Co. put on special
trips (return fare, 35.) on holidays; but the
Port Jackson Co., whose descendant is now
having an argument with the Manly Council
over its desire to increase fares, did not arrive
until the year before the municipality was pro-
claimed. When the six-horse coaches used
to jingle out of the valley to Narrabeen and
Newport, Manly was a real picnic-ground,
nowadays it has become rather like a
tremendous circus.
“Six-and-Eight” : Willum Henry Tregon-
ning’s prayer (B. 30/12/’26) recalls that of
HIS OTHER SELF.
“Passed you in the car this morning — didn’t you know who I was?”
“No, really! Who were you?”
another Cousin Jack who taught in a Metho-
dist Sunday-school which I. in childhood,
was hunted to attend. “Ta-ake the children,
Looard, and shake ’em, Looard, over the bot-
tomless pit till fear of Thee be putten into
their black little hearts” is a fair sample of
the petitions with which he bombarded the
Almighty every Sunday.
AN OLD DOORWAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Good-night.” One kiss, and then you left me
standing
Longing and lonely in the rain-swept street,
Hearing inside the house upon the landing
The dying echoes of your flying feet.
There I stood still beneath the oleander;
The storm had washed the stars across the sky
And swept dead leaves and fluff from the verandah.
“Good-night ?” How well we knew it meant
“Good-bye.”
Yet still the warm lights in the windows winking
Signalled their friendly message just the same,
And a black kitten in the gutter drinking
Blinked in surprise to hear me call your name.
1 watched for you while all the trees were shakirg
Their heads in pity till the blinds were drawn,
'ml one by one the lights, the street forsaking,
Vanished; and I went home, and it was dawn.
1 many were the dawns and dusks thereafter,
ith other lips to taste and joys to share,
' omings and farewells, and tears and laughter,
I forgot that dawn of drenched despair.

Malcolm Fraser is one of those quiet
men who climb without seeming to do so.
His job as Government Statistician of Maori-
land is one he sort of grew into. He was
born in Inverness, which was not his fault,
and his family took him to the Shivery
Isles at a very early age. There he learned
to play football and developed a great fond-
ness for figures. The Land- and Income-
tax Department swallowed him up at the
age of 20, and nobody took much notice of
him for 15 years. The cry then went up
MALCOLM FRASER, Government
Statistician, M.L.
for a good, reliable accountant to brood
over the civil servants’ superannuation fund,
and Fraser came modestly forward. He
showed so much intelligence and resource
in devising a system of accounting to meet
the fund’s needs that when, three years
later, a Government Statistician was wanted,
Fraser’s right to the job was reckoned to be
undisputed. He is 53.
Nothing in the history of Australia’s
shark tragedies excels the performance of
15-year-old Stanley Gibbs at Port Hacking
(N.S.W.) last week. When another lad,
Mervyn Allum, was attacked by a shark in
20 feet of water, Gibbs leapt from a launch
on which he was standing, and, straddling
the shark’s back, thumped and kicked the
monster till it let its victim go. Then he
supported the terribly injured Allum to a
rescuing boat, beating off another attack
of the brute while doing so. The story
sounds like an extract from Munchausen,
but a police-constable on the beach near by,
who saw the whole happening, has told it, as
written, in liis official report.
These Australians are everywhere. The
Government Geologist of British Honduras,
Central America, is a Victorian, Leslie H.
Ower, one-time of Haileybury College, after-
wards of the Vic. Geological Survey. Dur-
ing his 14 years with the department he
specialised in boring, ' and was responsible
for the original estimates of coal at Won-
thaggi and Morwell. Although he was
turned down for military service, the British
Government selected him in 1920 to make a
mineral survey of British Honduras, and
lie has been at work on the big job ever
since. Victoria has been a great training-
school for geologists; the British Govern-
ment has no less than five of them at work
in West Africa —including E. O. Thiele and
A. E. Kitson, the latter just knighted.
Fate had decreed that Ilibbert Henry
Newton, Clerk of the Vic. Parliaments,
should never draw a pension. Two days after
his formal retirement from his job, after
nearly 47 years’ service as a public officer,
Death claimed him. He was an example of
the fine type of cadet the Vic. service some-
times managed to capture before the days of
competitive examinations, and he justified
his Selection and every step of promotion.
Though he reached the height of his ambition,
he was prouder of the achievements of liis two
doctor-sons than of his own success. He
“Pretty tight, isn’t he?”
“Tight! Why. strike me pink, if he was a
ghost he wouldn’t give yer a fright!”
was a link with Vic. political history. Ins
dad having been one of the members of the
first Assembly under responsible government,
and P.M.G. in 1860.
Vic. ex-Premier Lawson and Newell have
dissolved partnership as solicitors at Castle-
maine (Vic.). Newell has joined the Lyncli-
McDonald firm in Melbourne, and Lawson
has taken his newly-fledged barrister son into
the business. Bowser will not be a candidate
for the Chair in the new House, aud the old
members who will get back will welcome an
opportunity to make up to Lawson for his
rejection in April, 1924.
Colonel Arthur Butler, who becomes
medical officer at Duntroon (Canberra) and
Deputy-Director of Medical Services, has
been engaged in compiling Corps
section of the official history' of the A.I.F.
In some ways this record will be as interest-
ing as those of the units that fought with
bayonet and gun. In the S’African cam-
paign six deaths out of every ten were due
to disease, but the A.I.F. Medical Corps
glories in the remarkably low record of two
deaths from disease in every one hundred.
Amongst the achievements of the Australian
doctors was the resuscitation by heart pulsa-
tion of a Digger who had “died" under an
operation in an advanced station.
Over 60 years ago the prize pupil of
Sydney’s famous Fort-street School was
Edward Henry Rennie, son of the indomit-
able N.S.W. Auditor-General of those days.
The youngster passed on to the Grammar
School and the University. He graduated
M.A., and picked up other degrees at Syd-
ney and in England. In 18S5 he became
Elder Professor of Chemistry at Adelaide,
and held the chair till Death called him last
week. The dead man’s brothers were Charles
Edward, a former member of the Land
Appeal Court, and the late well-beloved
Dr. George ; a son is Lecturer in Engineer-
ing at Melbourne Uni., and another, now
dead, was a professorial colleague of his
father at Adelaide.
Adelaide ’Varsity had an unusual sort of
graduate at its recent conferring of degrees.
William Donnithorne was a local business
man for years before brush and palette cap-
tured his attention. Then he visited most of
the capitals of Europe to study art. After
a spell of war service—though by this time
over 40 —be switched over to law. Now he
has earned the LL.B degree. Donnithorne,
though neither a “Tre,” “Pol” nor ‘‘Pen,
served a term as president of the Cornish
Association of South Aus.
There’s money in billposting. Joseph
Daniels, who early trained his eye to a habit
of regarding blank walls as free advertising
space, left £43,576 when he died the other
day. He was one of the best known bill-
board contractors in Sydney. A notable
plouglier of the same field was Bill Anderson,
who rose from billposting in a country town
to theatrical management. It is said of
Anderson that, having engaged an actor who
was in his debt for billposting done many
and many a long year before, lie cut the
amount out of the mummer’s first weeks
salary. A Scottish ancestry is a grand aid
to peezness.
The passing away of W. R. Rucker, a
well-known Melbourne accountant, recalls
the fact that liis grandfather, W. P. A.
Rucker, started the first bank in Melbourne
in 1838, as agent for the Derwent Banking
Co., of Hobart Town, just before D. C.
MacArthur opened a branch of the Bank
of Australasia. Batman and Fawkner were
among Rucker’s first customers. W.. F. A.
Rucker was a pioneer of the overseas ship-
ping trade, and was associated with the
establishment of the first fire and marine
insurance co. in Melbourne.
“Bull” Callinan, once the
doyen of the Reds on the W.A.
goldfields, who earned a seven
years’ stretch in Fremantle
Gaol for holding up mine
officials and relieving them of
the pay-bag, had high hopes of
release when Labor was re-
turned to power. Petitions
galore were circulated in the
West, but they were of no
avail. In gaol Callinan is
credited with having organised
stop-work meetings among the
prisoners and w’ith having
preached the Red gospel assidu-
ously, but even that didn’t get
him out.
Artist Henri Tebbitt, who
was 36 before lie came to Aus-
tralia but rapidly acclimatised
himself, laid down his brush the
other day. He was born in
Paris of English parents, and
was there when the Germans
laid siege. Old Aldenhoven, who
didn’t know much about art but
could sell pictures, regarded
Tebbitt as the star of his gal-
lery contributors when Austra-
lian art was young and Alden-
hoven’s gallery its only Sydney
mart. It was a lean time for
artists, but the hard-working
Tebbitt managed to live, not uncomfortably,
lie was a musician, too, and could tell a
good yarn.
On her commission as the Prince’s floating
palace, the Renown will bring five Aus-
tralians home on the upper deck. One of
them, Lieutenant H. P. Morgan, learned the
whims of torpedoes in the Australian navy,
and when the Aussie fleet became a mere
nucleus lie transferred to the British navy.
The other four are middies.
The Golding sisters —Belle has just retired
from her job of inspector with the Depart-
ment of Labor and Industry—took their
militancy in the matter of women’s rights to
great lengths. At a debate upon the suffrage
question, conducted by the Eastern Suburbs
Debating Society, one of the members kept
a record of the Golding interjections. Belle
chipped in 145 and Annie 54 times. Kate,
who is Mrs. Dwyer, wasn’t there, or the
argument might never have been finished.
Just-knighted Colebatch, W.A.’s retiring
Agent-General, will share with Tom Bridges,
the South Australian Governor, and Abe
Bailey, the S’African plutocrat, the distinc-
tion of having the shortest and most free-
and-easy handle to his name imaginable.
“Hal,” in his case, is not an abbreviation of
Henry or Harry, but a genuine label pasted
on him at the baptismal font. There must
be many other Toms by christening, and there
may be Abrahams whose sponsors econo-
mised in letters, but there can’t be many
Hals.
Burley Griffin, one-time architect of the
Federal capital, returned to the scene of his
blasted hopes the other day, and, being a
polite person, expressed himself as pleased
at the way his plans were being carried out,
but spilt a mild curse on the Commission for
planting imported trees. Griffin, although
an American, acts up to his faith in our
beautiful Australian flora. He laid out a
garden suburb eight miles from Melbourne.
He planned it with curving roads; the
blocks all radiate from central reserves, and
wherever there were gums he established a
park. He also planted on his own allot-
ments over 100 varieties of Australian
Vic. State Governor SOMERS, wearing his
shy air of exclusive solemnity.
flowering trees. That was eight years ago.
The other day the last of the 300-year-old
gums growing on the reserves was chopped
down, and most of the native trees have been
stolen. Griffin is associated now with King
O’Malley in another model village on the
shores of Middle Harbor, Sydney.
Ernie Bourne, Vic.’s new Superintendent
of Telegraphs, is the youngest to occupy such
a position in any State. He is still in the
early forties. He first came into prominence
through his draughtsmanship, and was per-
suaded to take a course in electrical engineer-
ing. After a spin as telegraph engineer in
Brisbane he stepped into the superintendent’s
shoes there. His move down south is a big
one for him.
Probably the first metropolitan mayor in
the Empire to refuse to wear the fur-trimmed
robe and golden necklace of his office was
Maoriland’s Tommy Taylor, who was a
i .aborite of sorts. The things were put on
him at Christchurch 15 years ago. But the
evening of the first council meeting was
warm, and inside 10 minutes the mantle was
lying over the arm of his chair and the chain
was tucked into a drawer in the horseshoe
table. He never wore them again. Sydney’s
Labor-Mayor Lambert took a similar aver-
sion to the trappings, and Stokes carried
on the tradition. Mostyn doesn’t wear them
either.
The last of a quartette concerned in one
of the most notable of the affrays of the bad
old days of Macquarie-street passed out with
the death of Bob .Tones, who represented
Mudgee in the ’nineties. W. P. Crick threw
one of his bluffing challenges at Jack Haynes,
who invited him outside and proceeded to
give him the hiding of his life. Tom Hassell
tried to interfere, but Jones observed judi-
cially that Crick richly deserved what he
was getting, and if Hassell went to his
rescue he would have a fight on his own
hands. So Crick went unsuccored. Jones
was 82 at the end.
The idea of having one’s cremated remains
scattered on the open sea seems to be attrac-
tive to old sailors. A Maorilander, Captain
Collins, had such a funeral off Lyttelton
Heads the other day, and the Aorangi
brought to Sydney the ashes of Captain
Gardner Johnson, who for long years was
a skipper on the Australian coast. A job
as Lloyd’s agent kept him at Vancouver
later on, but he always regarded himself as
an exile, and when pending death frustrated
his hope of an ultimate return, his last re-
quest was that his dust should be mingled
with wind and wave outside Sydney Heads.
HIS EXPLANATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Sneaking at Auburn Mr. Lang assailed the Metro-
politan press which had described him, among otaer
riiiTHJS as not fit to go into society, it seemeu,
he added, that because he did n°t attend various
social functions, but carried out legislation that ne
had promised to do in his policy speech, he had
earned the of the pi ess.
I toil and moil till stars grow pale
Far from the social racket ;
I fairly loathe a swallow-tail
And scorn a dinner jacket.
C'hie snow-white ties offend my eyes,
Stiff shirts repel and fret me,
At glossy pants 1 look askance
And hence the press has set me.
[jet others gloat o’er bills o faie,
With gleeful gusto shaking.
The only bills for which I care
Are statutes in the making.
At glad shivoo 'or banquet board
There’s none can say he s met me,
And abstinence’s sole reward
Is that the press has set me-
Out on the clash of folks and knives,
The clink of toasts in bumpers!
My job’s to brighten navvies’ lives
And mend the lot of lumpers.
Where’er celebrities are fed
They bid but never get me;
I send a deputy instead,
Wherefor the press has set me.
I scheme to cook the Gov nor s hash,
The Upper House to throttle,
And not with champing jaws to mash
The bird, or hit the bottle.
I want no soapy mayors to greet,
No aldermen to pet me
O’er sparkling wine and costly meat—
That’s why the press has set me.
’Tis tough to get, you must allow,
This journalistic toko,
Because I never learned me how
Desipere in loco,
I can’t unbend, go gay, relax,
E’en if my cares would let me,
And so it deals me lusty whacks
.lust where the turkey gets the axe,
The carping press that’s set me.

“Ledraw” : I think there is no doubt about
the power of snakes to hypnotise (B.
23/12/’26), but they use it only when after
a grub stake. Any number of people are
good mesmerists, but do not use their power
all the time. I have seen a carpet-snake bail
up a rabbit. The rabbit could have escaped,
but seemed quite helpless. I have also seen
both black- and whip-snakes hold frogs in
the same way. The best exhibition I ever
saw of a snake’s power was at Sambur, in
India. A clutch of jungle-fowl was feeding
on the clear patch I was watching. I
noticed it bunch up, and, seeking a cause,
carefully examined the jungle opposite with
my glasses. There I saw a hamadryad, or
king cobra, gradually bring the clutch within

of offensiveness.

“Wang”: The two swaggies entered the
township from different directions, and met
on the verandah of Ryan’s pub. Each bluey-
bumper was accompanied by a dog of dubious
parentage and ancestry. They stood and
eyed each other's tyke speculatively. “Rather
a good sorter dorg yer’ve got there,” re-
marked the tramp from the South affably.
“Whatcher reckon he’s worth, now?” “A liun-
dred quid that dorg’s worth of any man’s
money?” promptly replied the man from
the North. “What’s yer’s worth?” “I
wouldn’t take a penny less than two hundred
quid fer him,” replied the other. Ryan had
been standing at the door listening to the
conversation, and the two owners of valu-
able dogs put it on him for liquid refresh-
ment. Ryan said “Yes,” but he’d like to
see the cash first. He didn’t; neither was
blessed with a bean. The tramps were im-
portunate, Ryan was obdurate —no cash, no
beer. Then two grievously hurt swdgmen
whistled up their tykes, and moved off to-
gether, and Ryan, the hard-hearted, had
wafted to his ears their bitter plaint: “Blime!
Three hundred quids’ worth of dorg, an’ we
can’t get a blanky drink on tick!”
*****
“Masua”: Here on the Sepik River
(N.G.) I read to my mate “H.V.H.’s” par.
(B. 26/8/’26) about the Jap diver swallow-
ing cockroaches to cure his headaches, and
instead of the old chap making his usual
lurid remarks anent liars, he said: “You
know, it might be dinkum. Remember me
tellin’ you about the time me an’ Stingaree
was fur-tradin’ [dog poisoning] up on the
Flinders? Well, I got pretty crook, and
couldn’t get about much. So Stingaree
reckoned he’d fix me up. He come up to me
with something hidden in his hand and says,
‘Now, Bill, open your mouth, an’ when I
says “Go!” you swaller hard.’ . It was
damned hard swallerin’, but I got ’em down
an’ asks ’im what they was. ‘Oh,’ ’e says,
‘them’s bush pills. The dinkum stuff —never
knew ’em to miss so long as yer swallers
’em backwards.’ I didn’t have much sleep
that night, perambulatin’ the bush, but
they’ll do me—betteran all the salts.” “Any-
way, what are bush pills, Bill?” I asked.
“Them big brown grasshoppers with spikes
on their legs as can kick like blazes,” William
told me.
“Emma Don”: “Stellsby” told only half
the story of the collie with the broken leg
which applied for treatment to the casualty-
room at the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne.
Following the publicity given to the incident,
an alleged owner presented himself. The
collie greeted him in a friendly way; but,
then, he had made friends with everybody,
so the secretary asked the claimant to prove
his title. “Fair enough,” he said. “Stand
at the front entrance with the dog.” He
then straddled his motor-bike, and, having
kicked the engine into life, opened the door
of the side-car. Without a word being
spoken the collie hopped down the ramp,
climbed into the car and seated himself
with the air of one quite at home. The
door was slammed, and off they went.
* * * *
“Damphool” : Twenty years ago I came in
contact with some foreign matter floating on
the waters of the inside passage to s.-e.
Alaska. Experienced whalers of the party
immediately recognised the, pungent aroma
of ambergris and closely scanned the neigh-
boring bays and promontories for any signs
of a whale that had become a beachcomber.
Shortly afterwards a whaler of the Tyee
Deepsea Fishing Co. hove-to at an inlet and
got busy on the work of demolishing a sea
mammal. The big fish was lashed alongside
the steam trawler, and measured two-thirds
of the boat’s length—about 110 feet. The
brain had been opened up and two hands
were baling the cavity rapidly while as yet
the contents were in a fluid state. Were
this not completed quickly the air would
soon congeal the liquid substance and so
reduce its market price considerably. Other
workers were stripping huge slices from the
creature’s back and stowing them below.
They also had to work with some speed, as
thousands of seagulls were engaged at non-
union rates filling their own holds. These birds
were not the only uninvited guests, there
being thousands of good “red” Alaskan salmon
also at the banquet. The fish were feeding
on the whale’s belly in such massed num-
bers that one could almost walk on the
silver platform they made round the craft.
ANOTHER UMBRELLA LOST.
DAD (to Dave after operation following accident): “ Fcelin’ comfortable now, Dave?”
DAVE: “No, I don’t. Seems to me the doctor left his umbrella in me, and it’s tryin’ to
open."
“Kapara”: I suspect that the drongo is
the bird that “AdeL.” (B. 4/11/’26) has
heard sending out “music like that of a
steel guitar.” He should look for a black
bird about the size of an English starling,
with glossy plumage and a fishtail. The
drongo peals out the most musical notes
I have listened to from any bird. Here in
the Gulf Country the bird is migratory, and
is to be heard at the approach of the wet
season. It frequents dense scrubs, makes a
tiny cup-shaped nest on a slender bough,
and disappears after the “wet.” Another
wet-season visitor is the “storm-bird”
(channel-bill cuckoo). This bird utters
what Gould aptly describes as a “horrid
scream.” The most melodious and most hor-
rible of bird-calls favor us tropic-dwellers at
the same season year after year.
*****
“Emel”: Although the rooster is as free
from brains as anything living, he can take
a hint. Our Rhode Island Red would follow
me round when I fed the various batches
of chicks, until, one morning, irritated by
his persistence, I struck at him with the
stick I usually carry. The result surprised
me. I hit him. To my horror, he keeled
over, fluttered and kicked feebly, then lay
still. As he is reputed of world-champion-
ship strain, I felt far from happy over
the success of my swipe. The chicks were
small and hungry, so I finished feeding them,
always with one eye on the corpse. After
several of the most conscious-stricken
moments I have ever spent, to my intense
relief I saw him rise and stagger drunkenly
away. He had fully recovered, but has never
since shown the slightest interest in chicken-
feeding operations.
“Muggins, .Tun.” :
We did a bit of
fishing at Tallan-
gatta (Vic.) a
few days ag o.
When chased a
snake ran into a
hollow log and
could not be shifted
by chopping or roll-
ing the log, so a
frog was used as
bait on a large-
sized fish-hook, and
thrown down
the hollow. We
didn’t have long to
wait before the
snake was on. He
took some pulling
out, but we man-
aged it—the hook
was firmly caught
half-way down his neck, or where his neck
should be.
“The Deacon”: A better anti-ant device
than standing the legs of the kitchen-table
in powdered lime (B. 9/12/’26) is pro-
vided by the family castor-oil bottle, - Satu-
rate four thin strips of flannel with ,tlj£’pur-
gative and bind them around the legs.'-' No
ant will cross these barriers.
“Pick”: Talk of luck! Sitting upon a
heap of rubble that fossickers had forked
from their half-mile tail-race at Meraccle,
on the northern extremity of the Iviandra
auriferous country (N.S.W.), while his mob
of untamed mountain scrubbers swayed by,
Jim Thompson, a drover, grabbed from the
mound a black, shiny gibber to heave at a
bullock whose pawing and snorting threat-
ened trouble. Because of its unusual weight
Jim examined the stone. It was a lump of
oxidised gold worth nearly £4OO. The sub-
sequent rush upon the rubble heap did not
result in the discovery of another penny-
weight.
* * * *
“Nella Ray”: “James” (B. 28/10/’2G)
says two cups of washing-soda is a sure
cure for curly leaf in peach-trees. “Max”
(B. 18/11/’26) laughs the idea to scorn. I
have a peach-tree in my garden at Glenelg
(S.A.) that was so badly infected with the
disease that the fruit was beginning to
shrivel. I gave the soda cure a whirl —
buried two cupsfull six inches deep at the
base of the trunk. To-day, a month later,
the tree is absolutely cured. Who’s right?
• * *
“Bunny”: I see nothing startling in E.
Philp’s performance of riding one horse 83
miles in 12 hours. I have known this to
be beaten many times in the course of a
day’s work. Clappertons, of Tarong station,
had a horse which used to complete the 70-
mile journey from Tarong to Spring Bluff
over one of the roughest roads in Sugarland
in a sulky with two aboard in seven hours.
The same horse would take his place in the
spring-cart and the harrow during the week,
and win a hack race at the week-end.
* * * *
“Harvlb”: Further evidence that the
north-west of N. S. Wales was once inhabited
by mammoths is confirmed by the finding of
teeth on the Barwon River banks 15 miles
north of Walgett. The prehistoric owner
of the grinders had an OS size in bites, as
the crown of one tooth is about two inches
by an inch. C. R. Brett, of Walgett, who
found most of the teeth and packed them to
be forwarded to Sydney for identification,
lost the parcel when his offices were

destroyed in the disastrous town fire. The
recovery of the fossils from the debris now
appears as improbable as the capture of a
live specimen.
* * «• *
“Munga”: Recent pars, on the direction of
whirlwinds remind me that in the tropic: l !
scrubs of Queensland all the creepers climb
around trees in a clock-wise direction. The
only explanation I can give is that they
follow the sun. If this is the case they
should climb in an anti-clockwise direction
in the Northern Hemisphere. Can any Abo.
enlighten me? Pandanus palms corkscrew
in either direction, but those with a right-
hand twist appear to be in the majority.
THE HUNDRED-ACRE PLOT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
No longer do I hear the muffled sound
Of plodding hoofs upon rain-softened ground;
No music of the chains and swingletrees
Nor scent of upturned earth borne on the breeze.
I’ll never listen to the cheerful neigh
Of Darkie’s greeting to the roan or bay,
Or hear beyond the pepperina knoll
“Prince ! Gee-back, Ginger ! Dutehie ! Hold-up,
Doll!”
No eighteen willing pals with flowing manes
Will raise recumbent swingletrees and chains
And plod the “hundred acres” with the plough.
My team is sold —we use a tractor now.
Maybe in time I’ll know her just as well,
This chunking thing that belches smoke and smell.
I hear her now —she’s on her noisy way
To plough the hundred-acre in a day!

“Sucre”: The wild pig of the Cooper coun-
try (S.Q.) is, according to “AdeL.” ill.
23/12/’26), unfit for domestic consumption.
I have been there and know that there is no
finer joint than a piece of pig pastured on
prickly-pear. I’ll admit that the animals are
on the lean side, but the flavor of their
flesh is equal to that of the best pig ever
cultivated in a cosy-cornered sty.

“Ginger”: Can any Abo.-liar settle an
argument which has been going on round
our camp circle for some time? It is on the
question of barking snakes. Old Bill Chappie
swears that whenever he encounters a tiger-
snake it bhrks, and occasionally varies the
bark by a whistle. The rest of the circle
pooh-poohed the idea till a visitor from
up north backed him up with this tale, which
he swears to be true. Late one night, while
YULETIDE BENEVOLENCE.
“For guidness sake, Donald, man, why are
ye holdin’ up ye trousers like that?”
“Sh, wumman! I put the buttons in the
plate.”
out in his yard, he heard a noise like a
cough. It came from a point about 10
yards distant. Thinking it was a dog, he
swung his hurricane-lamp around towards
the noise, and was surprised to see a big
tiger-snake. As the snake seemed dazzled by
the light he easily settled it.
“J,37”: Let me
enter this for the
Hard Luck Stakes.
Two boundary-
riders were aroused
from their slum-
bers some time in
the night by the
roars of a bull.
The only water for
miles round was
stored in two 100-
ga 1. corrugated-
iron tanks. This
water had to be
carted by motor-
lorry. The bull,
after getting his
head and horns
fastened in one
tank, proceeded to
empty the contents
and damage the
tank. One of th •
men seized a 32
cal. rifle, and, run-
ning out, opened up
a barrage on the
bull, with the re-
sult that the other
tank was perfor-
ated with bullets
and its contents
also wasted. The
bull, in his endea-
vor to free himself,
unearthed some
fox baits that had
been hidden under
the tank. In con-
sequence two dogs
were poisoned—the
owner of one of
them had refused
£l5 for it only a
day or two before.
The total net re-
sult was no water
for breakfast, two
men s pent the
night in a tree
minus their clothes,
two dead dogs and
two ruined tanks.
“Jimpy”: Is there anything that walks
or crawls, barring a politician, that has a
tougher hide than a grown-up bull? I have
seen the roarers charge through a stiff
barbed-wire fence without so much as show-
ing a sear. Not only can they negotiate
spiked-wire barriers without tearing their
jackets ; they will often go through leaving
scarcely a hair to show where they made the
passage.
“Jim Carew” : I once
saw a five-year-old
bullock on a western
N.S.W. station that
had been the victim of
a peculiar accident.
Some way, when very
young, the bullock
had managed to get
the end links of a piece
of chain about eight
inches long stuck on
its horns. Tlie horns
when growing had
been unable to break
the chain, and had
grown straight up from
the head and come
to a point. The bul-
lock was sold to a
local butcher on con-
dition that he re-
turned the horns to the
vendor. They are now
mounted and adorn the walls of h'is office.

C- Coral : Generally the flying-fox com-
mits ins depredations at night, and not much
is seen of him during the day. This year,
however, it lias been noticed in some of the
i orres Strait islands where the creatures
nourish that they are flying about in great
numbers during all hours of the day. especi-
ally amongst the cocoanuts and mangoes.
This unusual phenomenon has caused a good
deal of speculation amongst the natives, who
think “this different kind he mean some-
thing !”

“P.L.”: “These swaggies are making it
too hot,’’ said dad. “Here’s another, the
fourth, since milking. Yes, my man—work,
yes. Here, take this double-barrelled gun,
stand at the gate and shoot any more swag-
gies who want hand-outs.” The new-comer
demurred. “What yer want? Yer don't want
work. Here, gimme the gun!” But Swaggie
the fourth had moved on.
“Pick”: The composition of the team
makes all the difference where a heavily-
laden waggon trails behind, and the expert
teamster will shift tons over boggy country
where the novice would fail to engineer as
many hundredweights. In the van march the
leaders. They are the intelligent and best-
trained horses of the string. Without
attention they must swing the team on the
HIS LIFE-DRESS.
JIM: “What on earth arc you running about in a womans night-
dress for?”
TIM : “well, if the ship goes down-—women and children first.”
bends, hug the batters for a straight pull
on the turn, and allow clearing space for
the waggon on the bridges. Behind them
are the starters. They are required to lean
steadily into their collars, until the team
is straightened for an all-together pull, and
no rushers need apply for their job. Next
come the holders, the stanch fellows who
never permit the weight behind to pull them
backwards. Many of them the teamster has
cured of slacking by scratch-pulling them over
into a creek. The rear horses are the shatters.
They hold the load on the down-hill, and steer
all clear of the wayside trees, gate-posts
and culvert deck-heads.
* * *- *
“Trevdee” : The par. by “Black Tracker”
(B. 23/12/’2O) re a 64-year-old farm wag-
gon makes one wonder what is the record
service of these implements. A cocky in the
Wimmera (Yic.) has just bought a new
waggon because his old one is “nearly done.'
It is 70, and has been used every season
for carting wheat 12 miles, besides doing
other heavy toil.
* * * *
“L.M.” : Do tisli feel pain ? I don’t think
so, but I know insects do not. While a
common English wasp was feeding on honey,
I snipped him through the waist. He hesi-
tated a few seconds before resuming; then,
unhampered by “that feeling of fullness,”
he soon deposited at the southern end more
honey than the black and yellow abdomen
could possibly have held.
“Mullarula”: Outside Adamstown, near
Newcastle (N.S.W.), there is the petrified
trunk of a fair-sized tree; but I don’t see
how it reached this condition. Lying ex-
posed on the surface of a hill, it does not
look as if it had ever been covered with any-
thing, though it is partly embedded in sur-
face soil. It bears the appearance of some
kind of reddish stone, with black markings.
The hill on which it lies is of sandstone for-
mation. Part of the trunk has at some time
been broken off, and the fractured ends show
not only the grain but the sap-rings formed
during the growth of the tree. Before it
turned to stone it had been attacked by white
ants, and the cavities they made are unmis-
takable.
* * * #
“Fitz” : I have seen valuable dogs quickly
paralysed and die from the penetration of the
little brush tick, and Alec Brown, of Wherrol
Flat, near Wingham (N.S.W.), brought
under my notice the other day a rather
remarkable incident in connection with the
pest. Brown was out in the bush, and
came across a carpet-snake about seven feet
long. He was surprised to note that, though
the reptile tried to move away, only portion
of its body responded. Giving the snake the
“knock-out,” and making a post-mortem, he
found that three well-developed ticks were
embedded in the body of the strangler and
had paralysed the greater portion of it.
“The Rumpus”: I witnessed much the
same happening as that recorded by “Centre”
(B. 25/11/’26) of an interloping male mag-
pie winning the bride of another magpie
during his excursions for food, but with far
different results. Near by lived a pair of
merry wagtails, and after the third party
had made sufficient headway for the lady
to consider his proposals, the waggies took
a hand. They began to heckle the lovers
and only eased up when the genuine old
man returned. Suspicions were apparently
soon set at rest and peaceful home life con-
tinued until next day, when again hubby
went into the bush. No sooner was he out
of sight than the home-wrecker put in an
appearance, and went on with his dark work
without further molestation from the wag-
gies, who set off on a journey of their own.
Then they returned with the old man mak-
ing a beeline for home and in hot pursuit.
The interloper was caught unawares but
tried to escape. It was too late. Hubby
mixed it with lightning speed, the wagtails
helping and barracking, while the cause of
all the trouble sat serene as a queen, un-
moved at the sight of her lover being pecked
to death.
“Hobnobster”: At Toongabbie (N.S.W.)
railway-station I recently witnessed a bird
tragedy that would have wrung an elegy
from a poet. In a blue-gum tree about 100
yards from the station sat a peewee on her
nest. While I stood making a cigarette a
pair of marauding magpies flew at her and
chased her from her nest. With vicious
pecks they followed her from limb to limb,
until, her strength being exhausted, she fell
to the ground. Just as the bigger maggie
dealt the blow that killed her she uttered a
low cry that was answered by another pee-
wee on the wing. This one, obviously her
mate, rushed to where she lay, and his
grief on finding her dead was pitiful to
see. The black and white murderers, on
seeing him trying to lift his mate with his
beak, let out a whistle. As soon as he heard
it he sensed the perpetrators of the out-
rage, and rushed blindly at them. The
contest lasted only a few seconds, and he
lay dead, a few yards away from the mate
he had so lovingly and gallantly sought to
avenge.
• * * *
“Moe”: Parts of the North Australian
coast are the home of a small tick-like
creature which burrows itself into the skin
between the fingers and the toes of the
human being, and there sets up an intense
irritation. The insect is quite different from
the ordinary tick, and in morphological
characteristics resembles more closely the
chigger, of South America. It deposits its
eggs beneath the skin of its host, and when
they come to life the irritation is so in-
tense as to make the victim try to tear out
pieces of his flesh. The maddened victim
generally has a poor medicine-chest, and kero
sene is often tried. It is really no good; tin
only remedy is strong mercuric ointment,
rubbed well in several times daily.

“V-E.”: A friend living in open forest
country runs a small colony of soldier-
birds fed regularly on bread soaked in wate"
and put out for them on the top of a stump
hear the house. Strange mickies occasion
ally make claim to a share of the tucker, Ir.n

“Dud, we’re going to take that short-sighted
bloke to the eye-doctor. He thought a

“Well, lots of other men ha’ done that.”

it with.”
are invariably driven away by the rightful
proprietors of the restaurant, though they
allow _ their own chicks to feed with them.
Occasionally, as a rare treat, the soldiers
get a dish of milk, of which they are inordi-
nately fond. In earlier years, when skim
milk from dairies was left about in open
casks and other vessels, soldier-birds were
not infrequently found drowned in the fluid.
PLIFS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We may hear again the story of the everlasting
glory
That enshrines the sturdy pioneers of old;
Hut has anybody written how unfortunates are bitten
By a horde of fiies whose numbers are untold ?
No, all pens are concentrated on a country devastated
By the ravages of fire and flood and drought ;
We are called “heroic,” “splendid,” from a noble
race descended,
We’re “the backbone of the nation,” so they spout.
(It’s a tale to make the admiration rise,
But it’s positively silly to the flies!)
Oh, the flies, flies, flies
That settle round your bedside as you rise!
Through the day they swarm, aspiring
For your blood as you're perspiring.
And the last things at retiring are—-the flies!
There’s a dodge to capture weevils, other cures for
other evils,
Man may snare the wily rabbit on his place,
But for flies the method mainly is to speak to them
profanely,
For you can’t arrange fly-paper on your face!
Oh, it’s “Damn the flies!” and “Blast ’em!” as
you try to hurry past ’em.
It’s “Hell’s delight!” and “Stone the flamin'
crows!”
You plunge and lunge and smite ’em, call them
something as you fight ’em,
Feel them crawling in your ears and round your
nose.
(It’s a moral truth they’ll surely “bung” your eyes,
Will the devastating, irritating flies!)
Oh, the flies, flies, flies
That listen to the epithets that rise
As you try to make them scatter !
Your fondest hopes they shatter,
And the 01 "v things that matter are —-the flies !
(Sotto voce ) Damn their eyes !

AWOMAK'S
LETTER
The Macquarie, Sydney’s newest woman’s
club, ha,d its baptism of tea one day last
week. It is like a quietly luxurious and
very efficiently-run private house. The color
scheme is blue and gold, except in the card
and writing rooms, where a- deliciously cool
shade of green prevails. Four-post beds
with dressing-tables and wardrobes set to
the same time give the bedrooms that restful
look which is so noticeably absent from the
jazzy furnishings of the moment. Already
the club is 300 strong.
Just as Moscovitch always makes a speech
from the stage to deplore the modern theatri-
cal habit of making speeches from the stage,
the Australian actress (making one of the
deplored speeches) inevitably talks about the
dear mother to whose courage, confidence and
support she owes all her success; and Judith
Anderson, returned to the applause of her
own people on Saturday night at the Criterion,
did not miss her cue. When she had sin-
cerely spoken her piece, a homely little
woman in the centre of the d.c. front iow
betrayed herself by drawing her handkerchief
over her tears and trying to shrink out of
sight of the myriad eyes that were immedi-
ately turned upon her. The desire to share
with mother the glory of such occasions is
natural enough, of course; but similar bou-
quets are never thrown at poor old father,
who had to foot the bill.
While some of us were mooching about
city ways trying to find a cool spot and a
cooler drink in the clammy heat of last
Thursday, and others of us were grumbling
about the heat while we sat on wide veran-
dahs doing silly things with mah jongg, a
Sydney girl was showing courage and endur-
ance under extraordinary circumstances. She
was Nurse Laurie, and in company with Dr.
Gordon Craig she was slipping and stumbling
her way down the track into the Burra-
gorang Valley from Wentworth Falls, where
a badly-wounded patient awaited the sur-
geon’s coming. The party started the descent
about half-past nine, and arrived at the foot
of the towering cliff path at eleven. After
that the surgeon performed the operation
of removing a kidney accidentally shattered
by a bullet. The patient, young Alan Crago,
a grandson of old ironmaster C. H. Hoskins,
is doing well in the bush hut from which
it is at present impossible to move him.
The Bulolo goldfield in New Guinea has
nominated Mrs. Booth as its heroine. When
the_ rush came the lady saw a necessity for
which, of course, the slow-moving Adminis-
tration made no provision ; when men began
to drop from exhaustion on the way to the
scene of the rush, it was to the hospital Mrs.
Booth had hastily improvised, and where
she was doctor, matron, nurse and every-
thing, that they were taken. The Miners’
Association at the diggings has voted her
£lOO in recognition of her good work; but
that is a small thing compared with the
gratitude the miners—and the black carriers,
too —feel for the self-sacrificing pioneer.
Nearly 400 men and women testified to
their admiration for the Godhard couple’s
work for the cancer research appeal by eat-
ing a slice of chicken with trimmings in their
company the other day. It was one of the
biggest midday food-rallies this city has seen ;
the ballroom of the Australia was filled with
masticating admirers. The lunch was really
a triumph of organisation, and had been
worked up in three or four days. Rotarians
were there, and the Millions Club sent its
ambassadors. The American Consul and
lie of the Belgians sat at the same board.
Brand-new Mayor Mostyn not only put in
an appearance but spoke. Town-clerk
Layton shed urbanity on the assemblage;
and Dr. Constance D’Arcy flashed her
dimples. Minister for Health Cann sat near
Miss Preston Stanley without a quiver, and
Coates, M.L.C., unfurled a golden oration
to the glory of the guests seated before the
piled-up magnificence of red roses.
The final flourish was given to the cam-
paign for the cancer research fund last week.
In all nearly £125,000 was collected, of
which £32,000 came from the stamp side-
line, and the success there must be credited
to the active Godhard couple. Something
of the work behind their job can be guessed
from the fact that the stamps were only a
shilling each. No expenses were debited to
the general fund —the Godhard cheques
cleared them all. The effort ended with a
grand rally at the Wentworth, when foods
and jazz were partaken of by the workers
in the cause. Mrs. Godhard had organised
the frivol, and in a de luxe binding of black
and gold helped her husband entertain nearly
100 guests. Other members of the commit-
tee brought big parties, and Charles Lloyd
Jones midway through the evening handed
over fair speeches to Mr. and Mrs. Godhard,
and to the lady a gold vanity-box set about
with brilliants which might have belonged to
the days of Versailles.
Alfred Baldey, one time of the Upper House
in Maoriland, no longer has a widow. Lang-
don Scott, of Maequarie-street, made the lady
a bride the other day when the two exchanged
their vows in St. Michael’s, Vaucluse. Mrs.
Baldy, who is witty, a good dresser and an
authority on gardening, has been in Sydney
for some time.
Marie D’Arcy came from Bega to St.
Patrick’s on Church Hill for her wedding
with Lovell Tier, of Vaucluse.
Thelma Gallop, of Double Bay, hied hel-
lo St. Michael’s at Vaucluse to say the word
that changed her to Mrs. Keith Cudmore.
(The Cudmore family, once of Queensland,
now dwell in peace at Rose Bay.) Petal
pink were this bride’s georgettes and petal
pink her tulle veil. This was furthermore
embroidered with true-love knots and
tethered to her tresses with sprigs of white
heather. The livery of Thelma’s followers
was blue and gold, and only Swinburne
could do justice to the crimson roses car-
ried by the bride. Bishop D’Arcy Irvine
produced still another pair of handcuffs
from his inexhaustible stock, and then
everybody went off to the Cudmore home,
where the reception was held under the eye
of the bride’s mother.
Kirribilli had a festa on a sultry, star-
less night last week, when the yachting
Goddards celebrated son Max’s wedding to
Audrey Radford. Audrey belongs to the
north side of the Harbor, too, and her
father, 11. W. Radford, delivered her, a shim-
mering vision in rich ivory satin and Chan-
tilly lace, to the bridegroom’s keeping in
the chapel of North Shore Grammar. Padre
Davies ushered the pair through the door to
matrimony, fitted the lock and threw the
key away. Three ’maids, one in peach-pink
taffeta and two in powder-blue georgettes,
added color to the ivory tones of the bride.
Good-looking Jeanette Gordon chose
Friday for her wedding morning. She is
now Mrs. Keith Bray.
Arline Devlin, of Waverley, chose St.
John’s, at Darlinghurst, for her entry into
wedlock. The ’groom was John Burstal,
eldest son of the Scott Burstals, of Mel-
bourne.
Brian Windeyer, a younger shoot of that
family which has been wearing horsehair in
Sydney for nearly a hundred years, and
attractive Joyce Russell chose Christmas
week to announce their engagement. Joyce’s
dad, a lawyer too, is, among other things, a
director of the Sun. Medicine is Brian’s
job.
Queenslanders need no introduction to the
lady in this picture. She is Mrs. Sidney
Herring, wife
of the Briga-
dier - General.
Before her
marriage she
was Florette
Murray Prior,
one o f the
northern
State’s most
popular con-
cert singers.
Since the war
Mrs. Herring
h as devoted
her organising
abilities and
her gift for
public speak-
ing to various
women’s move-
ments, and, in
addition to
being presi-
dent of the
Woollalira branch of the Country Women’s
Association, she has accepted the president-
ship of the Country Women’s Club—that
alive little body whose headquarters are in
Bligh-street, a woman’s stone’s-throw from
the Union Club. Falk made this picture.
Barrister Alex. Ralston, sou of the K.C.,
lias engaged himself to a fair maid of Sussex,
Florence Currie, of Hove —the place where old
admirals spend their half-pay watching the
seafront. The lass arrives in Sydney with
her mother in March ; and then the wedding
date will soon be fixed. With his sign hang-
ing out in Phillip-street, Alec Ralston has
almost forgotten that he was a lieut.-colonel
in the Big Fight. But there are hundreds
of Diggers who won’t forget—they will keep
his great fairness in remembrance.
Bronzed and looking more the conqueror
than ever, John Flynn, one of the stalwarts
of the Australian Inland Mission, turned up
in Sydney for a holiday, after a two years’
absence, mostly spent in visiting the far-
scattered mission stations —he lias travelled
25,000 miles since lie left Sydney last, and
that’s an average of over 30 miles a day.
Flynn is happy because he has two new
hospital stations coming forward this year,
one on Cooper’s Greek, the other at Fitzroy
Crossing, in the W.A. Kimberley district. The
11. V. McKay Trust has offered the mission
£2OOO, if Flynn can raise £4OOO elsewhere,
to enable the mission to make experiments
with the medical air-service which Flynn
hopes will bring every Central Australian
home within reach of a doctor. Arrange-
ments are on the way, too, to bring all the
stations within touch of civilisation by wire-
less. Flynn’s plan is to dot Central Aus-
tralia with mission hospitals, so that no part
of the country will be more than 100 miles
from a centre of medical help.
This is Mrs. Muscio, widow of the late
Professor Bernard Muscio, and herself the
possessor of an unusually active allowance
of grey matter. Mrs. Muscio’s new pet is
the Travellers’
Aid Society,
which has just
put up its
plate at the
Central Rail-
way. She is
the president
of this society,
which has for
its object the
assistance o f
the woman
traveller b y
deep-sea boat
and train.
Every woman’s
organisation is
supporting the
ne w society,
and soon every
city wharf will
have a door
that invites the
knock of the
bewildered voyager. As it is, there is some-
body on duty at Central Railway for all
trains that arrive, day or night. Mrs.
Muscio is a vice-president and international
secretary of the National Council of Women,
and is the president of the Uni. Women’s
Union, as well as vice-president of the
Women Graduates’ Association. She devotes
herself mainly to educational subjects, while
her sister, Edith Fry, nowadays in London,
has turned wholly to art.
Lady Poynter, who has arrived in Syd-
ney with her husband, is a writer of prose
and verse of considerable distinction. She
is a daughter-in-law of the great R.A. whose
“Queen of Sheba” is so decorative in our Art
Gallery ; and her father was one of Britain’s
ambassadors in the “near East.” Her hus-
band has been manager for the Baldwin
Steel Co. in Canada, and takes a similar job
in Australia for three years.
“A.G.M.’s” line from the south of France:
Frances Saville, the Australian-born beauty and
singer, lucky in art and in finance, has just sold
her beautiful miniature villa, Nuramar, overlooking
Monte Carlo, for a handsome £15,000. She will
spend the winter at Monte Carlo in a small pied-a-
terre, pending the purchase of another home wherein
to place the fine tapestries, antique furniture, pictures
and statuary that were such an attraction at Nur-
amar. The purchaser of the latter is the Prince of
Montenegro. Only a prince could afford such a price
for a small villa; and Frances has been fortunate
in finding such an eclectic buyer.
After rounding off a long holiday on this
side of the map with a glimpse of Tassy’s
apple orchards, Major and Mrs. Grant Bruce
are booked for London by the outgoing
Demosthenes. Mary, who had the rare
experience of going to the altar without
changing her name, is, of course, the one-
time Gippsland girl whose kiddies’ stories
are now amongst Ward Lock’s best-sellers.
The slim, dark-eyed Maoriland violinist,
Julia Moran, died recently in Sydney while
on a visit to her sister. Mrs. Pat Nolan,
wife of the musical critic of the S. M.
Herald. After five years in U.S.A. Miss
Moran returned to M.L., and then came on
to see her relatives here.
A one-night’s opportunity caused by the
indisposition of Grace Stafford gave a bright
Australian girl, daughter of the Collett
Dobson whose name was at one time known
wherever travelling shows went throughout
Australia, a chance to make a vivacious
appearance as the thrice-married heroine in
“Abie’s Irish Rose.” The bright girl has
been with the Fullers for some time, but has
got less of the limelight than she deserves;
until now her understudying with Grace
Stafford has kept her completely in the
background.
The Royal Society of N. S. Wales is pass-
ing round the box to collect enough to com-
memorate the late chief of the Botanic
Gardens, J. H. Maiden. Evidently the
society thinks that something more eye-
arresting than the 66 parts already published
of Mr. Maiden’s “Critical Revision of the
Genus Eucalyptus” is necessary to keep his
memory green with the G.P., which associ-
ates eucalyptus mostly with colds in the
head. So a kiosk or pavilion is to tell of
its own mixed Japanese and Greek ancesti-y
and Mr. Maiden’s great services to science;
and what place so appropriate as the Gar-
dens he loved so well?
Recently arrived in Sydney Barbara Hope
Osborne, a daughter of Mrs. Norton and
the late Hope Osborne, eldest son of the
Ben M. Osborne family. After her second
marriage, to Captain Norton, R.N., Mrs.
Hope Osborne lived in England, but she will
be remembered as a very smart member
of Sydney’s most fashionable set. Her
daughter is staying with Mrs. Willie Man-
ning, and will probably visit the whole
Osborne clan before returning to England.
It will take Sydney a few months to get
broken in to its new underground railway.
Sophisticated-looking train-travellers wan-
der helplessly around the new stations, which
shows that townfolk are quite as capable of
being flustered as their country cousins
when confronted with anything new. Crowds
hang around St. James station at all hours
for no other reason than to view the arrival
and departure of the electric trains, and the
rapidity with which these move and the
fleeting sojourn at the stations clearly fas-
cinates them. A shock to aesthetic souls is
the contrast between the spotlessly clean and
dazzling tiled stations and the jungle of grimy
buildings on either hand as one emerges from
below between Goulburn and Campbell
streets.
The girl in the florist’s shop where this
Letter buys its three-penn’orth of gumtips
every week had a word to say about Christ-
mas orders. These were great and splendid,
and by lunch time on Christmas Eve there
wasn’t a blade of grass on the premises.
Presently a sumptuously-clad person alighted
at the shop-door and entered. “I want,
said he, “a bouquet.” The assistant threw
an explanatory eye around the flower less
bandbox. “It’s to cost £5,” went on the
customer, in what the assistant described as
one of those rolled-gold voices, “and it’s to
be made of prawns .” He paid the money,
gave an address and departed. Then a wide
net was cast about the fishshops, and two
perspiring artists worked feverishly, over the
creation in greens and boileds. Finally, it
went forth, a triumph of art, trailing deli-
cately pink roses and stephanotis.
Miss Brisbane commences 1927: —
New Year’s Day was fine and hot, and scores of
pretty summer frocks were taken to the Ascot races.
Scotch airs were played by the band in the rotunda,
and people who were not too deeply intrigued by
happenings on the course grouped themselves under
the trees. Captain Plant shadowed the Lieut.-
Governor, and Mrs. Isaac Moore and Pat O’Shea held
tea parties on the verandah. Mrs. Frank Hall was
in pale pink with a coat of black and gold, and a
black satin hat. Mrs. Baring Gould wore rosewood
georgette with a hat to match. Mrs. Mutton showed
bois-de-rose under a black georgette race-coat, top-
ping off with a grey hat that had a crown of the
same hue as the frock. Mrs. Blackman was in dove-
grey crepe de Chine. Mrs. Spencer Brown’s floral
mariette was worn with a black satin hat, and
Mrs. Robert Thompson’s frock was of cinnamon hue,
with lace. Mrs. Cadell-Garrick chose figured crepe
de Chine with a navy hat, and Mrs. P. L. Day’s
flesh color attire bore a stitched design in powder-
blue. Cecily Cadell-Garrick was in apricot, Kathleen
Hirschfeld in cream with gold girdle, and Mrs. H.
B. Fraser had ivory crepe de Chine and a black hat.
Rose streamers decked the School of Arts Hall at
Southport for the New Year Ball. The lights were
veiled in pink, and balloons bobbed amidst Oriental
lanterns. Gerberas and roses dressed up the supper
tables.
The Southport Hotel had a New Year’s Eve dance
in settings of apricot and eau-de-nil testified by
gold and silver balloons. Mrs. Ted Theodore ruled
the committee, and Mrs. Barron’s orchestra orked.
The Ross Munros had their usual New Year party,
with kilted pipers and all. Ross Roy was decked
out in balloons and flags, with brass bowls of zinnias and
palest pink hydrangeas, and the dining-room wore
roses. Yellow and pink snapdragons were in the
smoke lounge, and supper w'as laid in a big marquee
set amidst grounds hung with festoons of patriotically
colored lights.
Lieut.-Gov. Lennon opened the new Country
Women’s seaside rest-homes at Redcliffe—one, the
I.ucy Fairfax, presented by J. H. Fairfax in memory
of his mother; the other, the Darling Downs
hut, presented by the Downs. Each hut contains
three bedrooms, one living-room and kitchen, with
wide verandahs looking out on Moreton Bay.
Warwick had its picnic races in fine weather. The
president’s wife, Mrs. J. H. S. Barnes, was in
figured crepe de Chine with touches of black. Mrs.
Charlie White (Pikedale) had a black silk race
coat and frock; Mrs. G. Clarke was in cerise and
mastic; Mrs. Wightman (Gore) in saxe-blue with
a rose hat; and Betty Egan had a rose-pink hat
with her floral georgette. Mrs. Claude Newcombe had
a blue and fawn foulard; Pauline Curr, black and
scarlet; Mrs. Jack Cheshire (Brisbane), white crepe
de Chine; Betty Simpson (Sydney), navy with red
hat; Jean White (Stanthorpe), white and gold;
and Mabel Newcombe, pink and crimson crepe. In
the evening the Show building was the scene of a
ball.
News comes from Melbourne of the marriage of
Ethel Peters, of Brisbane, to Arthur Hinckley, of
East Malvern. The bride faced the altar in lace
and ivory mariette. Mrs. Arthur Watts, Sydney, lent
the veil, and Mrs. Lvng and Edith Todd, of Bris-
bane, attended the bride.

Chatter
Melbourne is back to yakker again after
its holidays, but suffers from that tired feel-
ing. In the florists’ windows the lavender
is beginning to fade and droop, and holly
lias retreated from the front line. Left-over
Christmas gifts in the big emporiums have
shed a percentage of their retail value, and
the fluff-shops are beginning to talk about
summer sales. The sex that a few days ago
tracked Christmas presents to their lair is
now scouting for cut-price models, stockings
of silk and stockings of silk that never knew
a caterpillar bearing tickets that can be
looked at"without a groan, and pretty French
undies at figures that don’t necessarily spell
bankruptcy to the buyer. The queues at the
bakeries that dispensed fresh bread are - but
memories, and the city has settled down for
another year.
The glorious weather tempted many
women to take their prettiest frocks along
to the South Aus.-Vic. cricket match
and make a picnic of it. Sandwiches
and the stout old thermos, supplemented
by the appetite that the great open
spaces engender, helped to make the
day enjoyable. Among the guests star-dotted
on the grass were Mrs. A. V. Ivewney, the
Lindley Bakers, the George Bells and the
Maudsley lady. Alister Clark deserted his
rose garden to watch the score; and Leo
Cussen, ex-Alayor Brunton and Senator
Guthrie had a pleasant day off.
Melbourne started the New Year with the
nearest approach to bread riots it has ever
seen. Bakers deserted their own dough and
ignored that of their customers from Friday
morning until the following Monday night,
and shopkeepers soon found that their sup-
plies of bread were totally inadequate for
holiday requirements. Monday morning saw
most of the suburban shops bare, and by
noon queues began to form outside shops in
South Melbourne, Collingwood and other sub-
urbs where an early supply of new bread
was expected. In Collingwood a few of
these queues became restive, and the ambu-
lance treated two youngsters who were
crushed in the surging crowds. Some shop-
keepers did a roaring trade in home-made
scones. Even patrician Toorak found that
the roast turkey and the crumbs of the
Christmas cake were not enough without
bread. The papers are now discussing the
need of revising the bakers’ awai'd.
Lady Somers is in a private hospital rest-
ing after a slight operation. The respite
from official duties probably won’t be a sore
affliction.
The stars on a red ground had an alliance
with the stars on a blue groulid when the
good-looking, fair-haired Sunday, only daugh-
ter of the Arthur Baillieus, of Toorak, stood
up at St. Mary’s, Sorrento, beside Leonard
Quinn, of Bahston, U.S.A., and started the
New Year with a new surname. It was a
ceremony of the sort that usually is described
as quiet and little. The bride eschewed
tulle and train and faced her big moment in
pale pink georgette and a crinoline hat. The
bridegroom’s mother and brother came over
from Sydney, where they are holidaying, to
give their blessings, and the new couple will
set up house in the Harbor City.
Josephine Mary, only chick of the Charles
A. Gilders, of East St. Kilda, looked real
elegant, as the Carinthians would say, when
she became Mrs. David M. Cuming. Her
gown, ankle-length and long-sleeved, was of
filmy cream silk lace, under which gleamed
gold tissue; and her tulle veil floated over
a train of lovely lace. She held water-lilies.
Matron-of-honor Airs. R. Wilson took her
stance in a mermaidy green georgette frock,
patterned with pink roses, and a hat to
match. The wedding was in Melbourne
Grammar School chapel, and the hurrahs
were unleashed at No. 9.
A surprise knot-tying on Christmas Eve
was that of Sadie Nicholas, sister of the
Aspro Nicholases, with T. E. A. Castles, a
Kyneton business man. A couple of months
ago Aliss Nicholas resigned the governor-
ship of the Female Prison at Coburg, which
she had very ably held for 10 years.
The Presbyterian kirk at Toorak was
crowded with the agrarian well-to-do when
Alexander William, son of the late M. A. B.
Pearson, of Berwick, and grandson of Wil-
liam Pearson, of Gippsland, married Con-
stance Ruth Wainwriglit, daughter of the
W. E. Wainwrights, now of Caulfield and
long of Broken Hill, where father manages
the big South mine. The bride was clad in
ivory satin scattered with bunches of silver
grapes, modelled on Elizabethan lines, over
which flowed a veil of Venetian lace. The
attendant maidens were her sister Phyllis
and his sister Betty. Their frocks of sunset-
pink, with accompanying tall millinery be-
decked with crimson roses, blended effectively
with the floral pinks and blues that tittivated
the church.
Wedding bells will soon be ringing for
Jean Louise Williamson, daughter of the
Charles Williamsons of Lake Bolac, Western
District, and Cecil Dempster Porter, one of
the bright young men of the B. H. Prop.’s
Sydney office, whose family seats itself at
East Maitland. The bride-elect lately quali-
fied as a nurse.
Macedon Golf Club held a beginning-of-
the-year revel at the club-house to the strains
of an orchestra that knew all the latest one-
steps and foxtrots. The Herbert Wertheims,
Mrs. Russell Clarke, Mrs. Herbert Lillies,
the C. B. Nortons, Mrs. Fred Tatham and
Nancy Stephens were among the dancers.
Mrs. R. S. Whiting let the Girl Guides
pitch their tents in the grounds of her Mace-
don home, Altona, for their week in training-
camp. Lady Somers, as State Commissioner,
donned her uniform, and did a tour of iu
spection early in the week; and the girls
showed that they hadn’t forgotten the domes-
tic arts nor their party manners. Comman-
dant Gwen Swinburne, with Marion Sin-
clair as aide, had charge of the company.
“Old Boy” Wilmot, sports editor of the
Argus, goes to Boston for a health trip and
to see married-daughter Jean, who, like
dad, is a fluent writer. Wilmot compiled a
splendid school record for the C. of E. Mel-
bourne Grammar when he was lion. sec. of
the Old Melburnians’ Association.
Robert Best’s lady has received a greet-
ing from daughter Margot, who hoped
to spend Christmas in Switzerland if the
Berry party could tear themselves away
from Paris. Sister Fhyllis has spent her
holiday doing a job. Using Renee K'elly’s
comedies as a springboard, she has taken
a plunge into the fillums, and will be seen
in an Australian movie which Vaughan Mar-
shall is making.
Helen Crivelli got back after a lengthy
sojourn in Paris in time to take a slice of
Christmas pudding with the family. Her
pet hobby is gardening; she did a training
course at Burnley School of Horticulture,
and she has picked up some French ideas
about the making of pleasaunces which later
may prove fruitful.
Earnest-minded Melbourne is listening
with rapt attention to W. G. Hoopei', who
is lecturing in the New Thought centre in
Russell-street. A successful schoolmaster 20
years ago, he chucked everything to follow
a light which he discovered in Trynes’s “In
Tune with the Infinite.” Later he earned
a Fellowship in the Royal Astronomical
Society for work in a less highly-rarefied in-
tellectual atmosphere.
The lady of the wavy hair and reflective
mien is the wife of Dr. lan Mclntosh, of
North Mel-
bourne, and is
herself a fully-
fledged physi-
cian, profes-
sionally known
as Dr. Anne
Easson. She
came from
Scotland a few
months ago,
and has not
yet hung out
her sign,
though she
means to enter
a professional
]) a r t nership
with her hus-
band. She is
an M. 8., Ch.B.
o f Glasgow,
and was for a
time dispenser
at the Eliza-
beth Garrett Hospital, the famous West
London institution for women.
Mrs. John Mclnerny, indefatigable worker
for good causes, goes on a well-earned holiday
to the Big Smoke. Her interest in the Mel-
bourne Ladies’ Benevolent Society, of which
she has been president for the last 10 years,
runs back to 1896. During the war her Red
Cross work in connection with the National
Council of Women gained her an 0.8. E., and
the Yooralla Hospital and Kindergarten for
Crippled Children, the New Settlers’ League
and Queen Victoria Hospital have been other
outlets for her energies. Kathleen Mclnerny,
who is lecturer in biology at Melbourne Uni.,
will accompany her mother.
Dr. Constance Ellis will be one of Vic-
toria’s representatives at the Medical Con-
gress in Maoriland.
There are Americans who have acquired
the habit of using a table-fork in lieu of
knife or spoon, and they do it very cleverly.
A fair daughter of Uncle Samuel who was
demonstrating her proficiency in the art at
one of our swellest inns the other day
aroused the compassion of a chivalrous and
impressionable fellow-diner who offered to cut
up her food for her. He thought her left
hand was disabled. His kindly suggestion
was received with blank astonishment, and
the lady didn’t discover what the knight-
errant was driving at until she told the story
to some Australian friends.
A Melbourne tenor who has climbed steadily
up the ladder of fame during the last year
or so is Nor-
man Bennett.
He is soloist
at St. Paul’s
Cathedral, and
his singing in
the Phil's last
performance of
“The Messiah”
was an out-
standing fea-
ture. lie was
Satyavan i n
the first per-
formance i n
Australia last
year of Gustav
Holst’s opera
“Savitri,” and
earned mu c h
praise. During
Percy Grain-
ger’s sojourn
here, Mr. Ben-
nett sang in
the choral compositions conducted by the
composer, who has promised to give him a
helping hand should he care to try his luck
in the U.S.A. Phyllis Lett, the English
contralto, has engaged Mr. Bennett as a sup-
porting artist for her Australasian tour,
which begins next month in Maoriland. The
singer is a pupil of Ivor Boustead, who was
also the teacher of John Brownlee, now
making- a name in opera abroad. The
picture was made in the Talma studio.
Since the sale of Rupertswood, the old
home of the baroneted Clarkes, the family
lias been reduced in numbers. Following upon
the sudden death of S’Rupert there came a
cable recording the passing, on Christmas Eve,
of his sister-in-law, the widow of Col. Regi-
nald Clarke. Particulars are not yet to hand,
but it is surmised that she died as the result
of injuries sustained in a motor accident
some time ago, which caused the cancellation
of a proposed visit to her native land this
month. The lady was a daughter of the late
Edward Govett. Her two younger children
are with relatives in Melbourne.
The Federal Government is busy repairing
and “reconditioning” Parliament House before
returning it to the State. Local legislators
are returning to their old quarters to find
them dolled up, with a new red carpet in the
Queen’s Hall, and rejuvenated unholsterings.
From Capetown comes a line to say that
the S’Africans have taken kindly to the G.
B. Post company and “simply adore”
Dorothy Brunton. The season, therefore,
has been extended. The new arrangements
include a return visit to Johannesburg, “Leah
Kleschna” being the kick-off of a six weeks’
season there, to be followed by a tour that
will take in Bloemfontein, Kimberley, East
London and Port Elizabeth.
In the matter of swanky rag dolls the
imported articles, though undoubtedly chic
and attractive, have not got it all their own
way in this city. For some time in Mel-
bourne they have had rivals in the quaint
fignres fashioned by Dorothy Sutherland, a
sister of Margaret, whose bent is musical.
This Christmas the Melbourne Book Club
provided a mart for the wares of yet another
local doll-maker, Mrs. Penleigli Boyd, widow
of the painter, who fashions trimly-clad
schoolgirl and ’boy dolls, appropriately
named. The quaint creations got a lot of
attention from present-hunters in the Christ-
mas shopping season.
A tale of woman’s pluck:—
Against travellers’ tales of foreign wonders I’d
like to mention a genuine example nearer home. A
Melbourne medical student married after passing her
fourth year. When the time for the fifth-year exam,
drew nigh she was busy with an expected baby.
Five days after the successful issue of the conflict
she sat for her finals and passed with credit.
Family history repeated itself last week
when Thomas Quinton, vicar of St. Mark's,
Geelong, and his wife had a golden-wedding
feast. The parents of both lived long enough
to indulge in nuptial jubilees. The vicar is
the oldest parish priest in Melbourne arch-
diocese ; he has been at St. Mark’s for
21 years.
From an Australian girl in Paris: —
At Jenny’s Winter Show I was most struck by
the- coats and skirts trimmed with unborn pony.
Another house on the same day was showing coats
and skirts trimmed with, and entire coats made of,
unborn calf. At Delmonico’s, the Ritz and the Florida
(the last the swish night-club of the moment) every-
body is dancing a tango that is very graceful and
elegant; all dancing is very slow, except, of course,
the Charleston, which is mostly favored in its flat
form. At these places the dancing space is extremely
small, and at the Florida you dance on a glass
floor lit up from underneath with ever-changing
lights. And all Paris goes abroad in the old hat of
her male relations —mostly it has the appearance of
having been just jambed on. Otherwise as the franc
descends crowns go higher.
Art-dealer H. Gill, of the Fine Arts
Gallery, has come back from Central Aus-
tralia convinced that our artists, in painting
Woy Woy and Heidelberg, have missed the
true Australian landscape. That is to be
found in the stark, bare Flinders Range
and the oceanlike plains of the interior, which
are not as monotonous as they are repre-
sented, on account of the variety of color.
The trouble is that the public has been edu-
cated by the coastal school of artists to
think otherwise. Kenneth Macqueen, of
Queensland, paints Australia’s interior with
skill and observation, but neither the city
critics nor the buyers have yet observed the
fact, and when all is said and done, artists,
like pawnbrokers, must pay their rent.
The Diggers picked up more than scars
in France. South Melbourne beach, once
defaced by decaying wooden bathing-boxes
and improvised shelters of sacking, is made
brighter this year by rows of striped tents,
each with a flag flying from it. The returned-
soldier ownen.of the outfit noted the idea at
one of the French watering-places, and is
making a good thing out of it.
Tassy sends a note with the apples:—
Lord Stonehaven arrives in time for the annual
regatta, and next day leaves on a walking tour
across country to Queenstown. Wayside huts have
not been so stocked with refreshment for many a
day. Fresh pack-horses, too, will take up the impedi-
menta at every camp. The Brocks are helping the
vice-regal party through part of the journey, and
Andy Lawson, the Minister who has just succeeded
in pushing the bill through the Upper House for a
road to Queenstown, will be waiting to greet the
foot-sloggers. Mount Lyell is being brushed up for
the G.-G.’s visit, but Tasmania is pouting because
it has been told that his Ex. wants a quiet time.
The Duke and Duchess want a quiet time here, too.
Cabinet is annoyed that the Yorks’ programme was
forwarded for confirmation without the Apple Isle
being consulted. And the fact that Holy Week
has been chosen for the Tassy visit is not looked
upon as blessed. Tasmania was entirely forgotten on
the Prince’s visit. He completed his Australian tour
and then came to Tasmania —after pressure had been
brought to bear on those responsible for the arrange-
ments. Little sister turns back yet another page and
points an incriminating finger at General Pau’s trip.
Captain Stopp, aide-de-camp and private secretary
at Government House, is leaving to take up a post
as secretary to the Administrator at Norfolk Island.
He marries Eileen Chancellor, of Hobart, and she
accompanies him. She is it in the Girl Guides.
Carrie, grand-daughter of C. W. Grant, of High
Peak, is engaged to a son of Professor McDougall.
The Grants have a wonderful house on the mountain,
where all the celebrities call. The present King and
Queen paid it a visit. A show garden laid out in
English fashion is the chief attraction. The original
Grant was our chief railway man in the early days.
Sister Adelaide starts the year cheerily:—
The clerk of the weather kept a kindly eye on
New Year’s racing and sent two Heaven-made days
for Morphettville. Lady / Bridges was there on both
days (her husband is at Kangaroo Island), all black
embroidered crepe de Chine on one day and navy
georgette on the other, and bringing with her on
Monday the Armstrongs as well as Mr. Winser.
Society is mostly at the sea or hills, but there was
a sprinkling of well-known people in the crowd.
A younger matron, white-clad from hat to heel, and
another just back from England, w r ho topped beige
crepe de Chine with a hat to tone, were among the
smartest frockers on the lawns.
From England comes news of the engagement of
Ronald, second of the Bertram Hawkers’ sons, to
Gertrude Mary Bellingham, daughter of Sir Edward
and Lady Bellingham, of Co. Louth, Ireland. The
Bertram Hawkers, living now at Runton Old Hall,
Cromer, have special associations with S.A. He is
one of the Hawker clan and she was a Fowell Buxton.
Their wedding was at the Cathedral during the
Buxton vice-regency of this State.
Local women’s societies have nominated Mrs.
Carlile McDonnell as woman delegate to the next
League of Nations Conference. Few women could do
the job better, and she has a delightful personality
to boot.
“A.G.M.’s” note from London:—
Lord Loch, the picturesque and stalwart son of
the first peer, with his wife and daughters, Maisie
and Jean, has come to London for the winter after
a long sojourn at their lovely country home, Stoke
College in Suffolk. The present Lady Loch is that
rara avis, a London hostess who entertains only her
personal friends. At many parties in the great
houses many of the guests are entirely unknown to
the hostess. Lady Loch is a sister of the Marquis
of Northampton, who, at the request of his dying
father, broke off his engagement to a fascinating
actress, a widow, and paid the lady a chivalrous
tribute by way of amende, together with the re-
markable breach of promise solatium of £30,000.
Lord Loch spent his youth in Australia and enjoys
nothing better than a talk to a back-country Aus-
tralian —he was just old enough when his father
was Governor of Victoria to thoroughly enjoy his
holidays in the country. Again and again he has
dreamed of an Australian Governorship; but he is
not a rich man —and there is the family to think of.

Objects.
The objects of the Company, inter alia, are :
To acquire as a going concern the very old-established business of the Vendors, known as
Gehrig and Co., Wine and Spirit Merchants, together with certain assets, detailed in the
printed prospectus, and to carry on tliis business on modern lines.
To acquire additional wine saloons, to finance hotels and wine-shops, and to establish
agencies in every State.. The wine saloons thus acquired will be brought up to the modern
high-standard type so well patronised in Europe, thus meeting the demand of a very large
proportion of the public at present not catered for in Australasia.
To erect a modern winery in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area.
Gehrig and Company.
The business of the Vendors is a well-known one, having been first established in Albury
in 1850, and in Sydney in lS7t>, from which date it has continued in unbroken prosperity.
Gehrig’s Wines are recognised throughout Australia and by the trade as ‘‘second to none,”
and they have been awarded the Champion Gold Medal for Sweet Sherries for the past eight
years in succession, this being an unequalled record in Australia.
Estimates.
It is estimated that the first year’s sales of the Company’s products will be in the
vicinity of £54,000, from which, as is well known in the trade, a gross profit of £27,000
should be earned. The expenses of management and other overhead expenses, including
Income Taxes, are estimated at £11,500, leaving an approximate net profit of £15,500, or a
little over 20 per cent, on the proposed issued Capital.
The Company is taking over a going concern with an established turn-over and a good
reputation, so that any estimate of the sales is thus made easier ; but it might be pointed
out that the Company should do a much larger business than the Vendors, who never
employed a traveller or spent money in promoting sales. By the proposed extension of the
business the modernising the same, the employment of efficient travellers, the perfecting
of distribution and the installation of modern selling methods, the profits should be consider-
ably greater.
Compensation and Licensing Fees.
The compensation and licensing fees paid by the undernamed
licensees to the Licensing Court were as follows:
H. J. Gehrig, Oxford Street, £ll7 for 1926.'
i C. F. Gehrig, Pitt Street, £ll7 for 10 months, 1926.
J. F. Lane, George Street, £49/5/- for 1926.
S. H. Slatter, Leichhardt, £97 for 1926.
The above figures represent 3 p.c. of the purchases in the respective
businesses and are sufficient to indicate that good profits are being made.
Assets to be Acquired.
In the printed prospectus appears a list of Assets to be acquired by the Company from
the Vendors. The list, which has been estimated on a conservative basis, totals £53,000.
In connection with valuations of licenses, leases, etc., these have been made on an
independent basis by such companies and people as Murrell and Co., Ltd., James P. Iloban,
C. P. Ellsmore and Arthur L. Garvey, all of whom are well known in the trade.
The Wine Industry in Australia.
During the year 1919-20 Australia produced 7,649,404 gallons ot wine. In the year 1923-
24 that figure had grown to 14,663,881 gallons, an increase of 7,014,477 gallons in tour years.
In 1919-20 Australia imported from other countries 91,954 gallons of wine. In 1923-24
the import figures had dropped to 76,758 gallons, a decrease of 15,196 gallons in four years.
Again, in 1919-20 Australia exported 801,161 gallons of wine. In 1925-26 the export
total was 1,722,622 gallons, an increase of 921,461 gallons in six years.
Great Britain imports 17,000,000 gallons annually. Last year Great Britain imported
the record total of 1,054,460 gallons of wine from Australia, leaving a balance of nearly
16,000,000 gallons imported from other countries —a huge market for Australia is still secure.
The consumption of wine bv Australians, medicinally and otherwise, is rapidly increasing.
The home consumption in 1919-20 was 6,848,243 gallons. In 1923-24 it had grown to
13,672,577 gallons, an increase of 6,824,334 gallons in four years.
The 1923-24 figures are quoted by reason of being the latest published by the Common-
wealth Statistician—the figures for later years will be far better than those shown.
From this it can be seen that the market for
icine—Australian wine—is a very large one,
and one that is capable of consuming all the
wine that Australia con produce for many
years to come.
The Main Points for Investors.
1. The business is a going conce.rn with an established trade
2. The business to be acquired has been in existence for over 75 years.
3. Net profits, free of Income Tax, are estimated to be £15,500, or approximately 20 per
cent, on the proposed issued Capital.
4. Gehrig's, Wines are recognised throughout Australia as being of the highest quality,
the' Champion Gold Medal for Sherry having been awarded for the past eight years
in succession—an Australian record.
5. The demand for Australian wines is growing both in Australia and abroad.
6. The Provisional Directors! intend to enter the Export Trade.
7. The Export Bounty is now fostering our Wine Trade, as shown by the Record Trade
Statistics, thus placing wine exporters in a stronger position than hitherto.
8 The Directorate is a very strong one, being composed of men expert in their calling
and including Messrs. C. F. and H. J. Gehrig, of the Vendor Firm, who have had a
lifetime’s experience in the Wine Trade.
9 Shares issued to Vendors in part consideration of sale are ordinary shares, thus
contributing shareholders must secure their dividends before the Vendors. This shows
the undoubted faith of the Vendors in the undertaking
Contract or contracts herein referred to are in possession of Alfred Rofe and Son,
Solicitors, O’Connell-street, Sydney.
The proposed Memorandum and Articles of Association may be
inspected at the offices of Alfred Rofe and Sons, Solicitors, Rofe
Chambers, O’Connell Street, Sydney, and it is the intention of the
Provisional Directors to frame these in accordance with the requirements
of the Sydney Stock Exchange with a view to the listing of the Company
at an early date after the Company is in working order.
Brokerage at the rate of 5% will be payable by the Company on
any Shares applied for through recognised or approved brokers.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
There could have been no more popular
win than that of Cave Dweller in the Moorefteld
Gold Cup. The gelding, by Peter the Hermit'(imp.),
is owned by two of the numerous Moore family which
has cut its name so deep on the counties of Cumber-
land and Camden. The racecourse at Kogarah takes
its name from the clan; one of them is closely
connected with the fortunes of the club, and the
horse is also locally trained. As in one of his two
just previous successes, Cave Dweller led all the way
last Saturday and had enough in reserve at the finish
to. withstand a challenge from Peri woo, on whom
Tfjohey appeared to ride a badly-judged race. The
joekey let the mare drop back about a furlong and
a half from the finish and was never quite able to
regain the advantage he had ceded to Cave Dweller.
All the same, the mile distance was not ideal for
Periwoo, who is essentially a sprinter, and on her
performance is not likely to lose her friends for
the Challenge Stakes, the big A.J.C. sprint race, run
at the Anniversary meeting. Many wiseacres would
not consider the chances of any of the better class of
horses for last Saturday’s big race, as they were
under the impression that a penalty would be incurred
for a win. It was not so, but the mistaken idea
saved some punters their money.
Cave Dweller is not in the Challenge Stakes, but
other runners in Lausanne, Janitor, Periwoo, Giggle,
King Oyllene and Honan are. The first-named is
one of Kelso’s trilogy at Randwick, and by no
means disgraced himself considering his not-verv-
forward condition. In the Carrington Valicare’s big
brother resembled a stalled ox and was in only a
little better plight at Warwick Farm on the Mon-
day following. If it’s wet on January 22, Kelso
is likely to start Lausanne in preference to Bairn,
and in case anything goes wrong with the former, ho
has Persuasion to fall back upon.
Paddy Wade, whose Magpie fillv Air Lady was mad?
a hot favorite in the Three-year-old division at Moore-
field and failed, is seldom far out in his race calcula-
tions. Last: autumn he made no mistake when he
retrieved Top Gallant from the stud to run in the
Caulfield Futurity Stakes. The imported horse, hov T-
ever, was afterwards beaten by Heroic and Valicare.
Top Gallant is being trained at Mentone by Lou
Robertson with) another Futurity in view.
* * * *
Punters didn’t do so badly at Aspendale
(Vic.) on Saturday last, three first favorites out of a
programme of seven events—the Purse was divided —
being successful. Billy Duncan has a great following
just now, especially at “down-the-line” meetings.
His mount, Coolness, was a 5-2 favorite for the chief
event of the day, the 10 furlongs Park Handicap, but
the Cooltrim mare failed to see it out. The Lanius—
Onega mare Ouragan (B’s) won in easy fashion bv
three lengths from the 20 to 1 shot Raith, with
Head On (B’s) in fairly close attendance. Ashlev
Reed rode the winner, and the time was 2min. 7sec.
Duncan was aboard another favorite, Byron (2’s), in
the five furlongs two-year-old race, and this time
his supporters collected, H. and M. Bourke’s Cyllene
More—-Darilla gelding, a stable mate of Quintus, win-
ning in good style by a length from Nekton (3’s)
and Censatis (s’s). The Absurd —Lalla Rookh mare
Poetaster (s’s) was first past the post in the' six
furlongs Plate, Solus (B’s) and the favorite Herilda
(7-4) following her home. The winner had run
very moderately in the Standish, but this was a
different proposition altogether. The first division
of the six furlongs Purse was taken by Phocion
(3’s) from Loverak and Pollymine, and the favorite
Wolla Walla (2’s) just squeezed home by a short
head from Duke Traquair (7-2), in the second
division of the same race. For the last event, the
seven furlongs Trial Welter, punters would have
nothing but Bob Lewis’s mount Idle Time, who
is trained by Robert’s brother, F. H. Lewis, and
had run a fair race at Caulfield on Boxing Day.
At the finish McShortodds demanded 5-4 about the
Gadabout gelding’s chance, and the good thing duly
came off, as he won in comfortable fashion bv a
length from Romaform and Citerior.
* * * *
Heroic, one of the most brilliantly erratic
thoroughbreds who ever graced the Australian turf,
and one whose career was more marred by circum-
stance than that of any of his contemporaries, is to
go to the stud. The beautiful son of Valais will
be leased from owner C. B. Kellow, after the con-
clusion of the A.J.C. Autumn Meeting, by a syndi-
cate headed by Herbert Thompson. Valais stock
has made such an impression on Australian racing of
late years that Heroic’s debut at the stud should
Command the attention of every breeder in Aus-
tralia, for he is the first of Valais’ sons to appear
in the • role. His performances are on every racing
man’s lips, but in spite of his temperamental show-
ing on occasion, and the incident which cost him his
chance of appearing in the V.R.C. Derby and the
Melbourne Cup of 1924, not everyone realises that
he has won a trifle under £35,000 "in stakes to date;
he is fourth on the list to Gloaming, Eurythmic
and Windbag. Whether he will carry on or improve
on the Valais tradition remains •to be seen; but,
as the St. Simoi) strain, as transmitted through
Bend Or, continues to have a mighty vogue in Eng-
land, Heroic, in whom it is strongly represented,
may yet be invited to reside there, as other famous
Australians have been.
* * * *
“T.R.” : The pleasant art of aptly christen-
ing racehorses seems less and less studied by modern
owners, or the delightful possibilities offered by a
sire with a name like Magpie would surely have
been better exploited. Some of the names given
to English thoroughbreds in the past must have
almost reconciled punters to losing money on them.
John Corlett, who talked and wrote horse for 50
years, awarded first prize for happy nomenclature to
Cameleon (Camel —Changeable). Others that he
highly commended were Cradle (Seesaw^ —Honey-
moon) and High-and-Mitev (Parmesan —Noblesse).
But was there ever a happier inspiration than Para-
dox (Sterling—Casuistry), second in the English
Derby of ’B5. Other names to linger pleasantly in
the memory are Van Diemen’s Land (Robert " the
Devil—Distant Shore), and Meredith (Merry Hampton
•—Edith). Then there was a colt by Baccarat out
of Scandal labelled Tranby Croft, a few years after
one of the late King Edward’s historic • indiscretions.
If there were only an occasional prize for the best-
named horse as well as the fastest, the turf would
be a brighter institution.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: The doping of horses and
greyhounds is a commonplace in these enlightened
days, but it is unusual to hear of it among human
livestock. Nevertheless, the stewards at the Mary-
borough (Vic.) Highland gathering had samples' of
saliva taken from all the competitors in the Sheffield
Handicap, and these have been sent to the Govern-
ment Analyst. Epsom salts, cigar ash or good plain
beer were the methods found to answer well in the
old days, when one wanted to be sure a lad would
obey orders and run a bye. They were easy to
administer and djd little harm, the beer method
being actually popular. In obstinate cases an acci-
dent might have to be arranged, but such inhuman
methods as filling a boy with dangerous drugs were
unheard of.
* * * *
Victorian cricketers are full of beans and
inns these days, ant} last week they more than avenged
their narrow defeat by South Aus-
tralia earlier in the season by
giving the Croweaters a first cousin
to the hiding recently inflicted on
N.S.W. The home side’s second
innings score of 649 (Love 188,
Hartkopf 126) left their oppo-
nents with over 800 to get, and
233 proved the extent of their
capacity, the little stonewaller,
Schneider, top-scoring with 53.
Arthur Richardson got 30, and
Vic 41. Outstanding features of
the game were the bowling of
Blackie and Morton for Victoria.
The veteran St, Kilda bowler took
7 for 134 in the match, but the
South Australian born Morton,
playing against his own State, did
even better, with 9 for 140. His
success makes it look as if South
Australia made a bloomer when
Jack Scott was brought across
from N.S.W. to sling down the
fast stuff, Inkster, the visiting
State’s newest ’keeper, gave a
great exhibition. In the two
innings he caught three and
stumped five batsmen. Grimmett’s
tally of 5 for 180 in Victoria’s,
huge second innings is also worthy
of mention.
* * *
Ponsford, it seems, is a
savings-bank clerk in Melbourne,
and it will be many years before
he is likely to earn by driving a
pen the £l5OO a year which
Blackpool ; (Lancashire) is under-
stood to be offering him for swing-
ing a bat. No sane person will
blame him for turning straight-out
pro., like Suzanne Lenglen or J.
O. Anderson, but it is equally
natural that his State should view
deploringly the prospective loss
of such a brilliant cricketer and
ask itself if it cannot be averted.
“There is no suggestion that we
Should pay Ponsford a salary,”
says one paper with ponderous
circumlocution, “but if it can be
done compatibly with his dignity
and our own we should endeavor to find a formula
to show him that there is in his own country a
career as alluring,” etc. A formula in figures,
one presumes, not words. Isn’t it high time Aus-
tralia and the Board of Control faced the question
of cricket professionalism fairly and squarely? It’s
no use saying it has to come, because it has long
been here, but it seems a seasonable time to express
a wish that some of the cant and humbug surround-
ing the payment of players should be stripped away.
* * * *
South Australia’s second Sheffield Shield
game with N.S.W. opened at Sydney on Saturday after-
noon. Of the nine plaj'ers whom the Ma State con-
tributed to the 1926 team in England only one
(Macartney) took the field; it would be interesting
to know how many of the other eight weren’t wanted
by the selectors and how many were “unavailable”
for mere Sheffield Shield cricket when there is _no
English trip in the offing. Batting first on a capital
pitch, S.A. did well to get 242 for 5 wickets by
stumps, for A. J. Richardson, - who piled up more
than half the runs, had a coupl e of lives, one when
only 48. Left-hander Pritchard showed a desire to
hit the ball while making 43, and Vic Richardson
was going well when the Newcastle googly bowler,
O’Brien, beat him with a “wrong ’un.” N. Fox.
of Gordon club, a youngster of 20, showed great
pace as well as a style that makes one hopeful of
nis future. He took 2 for 60. but was distinctly
unlucky. O’Brien ended the day with 2 for 65,
while the fastness and certainty in the field of J.
P. Hogg, the University colt, was a feature of the
play.
Heavy rain on Sunday did not seem to affect the
wicket,.and the visitors carried their score to 345,
A. J. Richardson compiling 189 before Macartney
Sot him. O’Brien finished with 5 for 99, an average
-'•alley himself could hardly have bettered. N.S.W.
opened solidly, but degeneration soon set in, Macart-
ney and Gwynne, each with 43, being the top scorers
in a feeble total of 198. liippax went at 32. McKay,
who at one period had 3 wickets for 13. finished
u 4 for 32, including Macartney, while Grimmett,
with 4 for 70, also troubled the batsmen, both
getting some help from the pitch. Inkster, the
giant keeper, was again in good form, catching
two batsmen and stumping another. The visitors
started their second venture 147 to the good, and
Schneider and A. J. Richardson put on 25 on Monday
evening without loss. Spectators witnessed some slow
cricket on Tuesday, with S.A. doggedly pegging away
to set their opponents a tough fourth innings contract.
Ihe second century was passed before tea-time for the
loss of 4 wickets with Schneider 88 n.o. A Richard-
son (30) fell to Fox, and the skipper (55) to Me-
Namee. The odds are all in the visitors’ favor.
* * * *
That wonder swimmer, “Boy" Charlton,
made an absolute hack of the visiting Japanese champion
Takaishi, when the pair met in the 880 yards N.S.W
Championship, at Sydney Domain baths last Saturdav.
Charlton won by over 60 yards in lOmin. 32sec.,
beating his. own previous best time for the distance,
and knocking 5 2-ssecs. off Arne Borg’s world’s
figures. Takaishi, who is known to be more partial
to the shorter distances, was in front for the first
three laps, covering the 220 yards in 2min. 28sec.
Charlton then let himself out, and soon left the
Japanese toiling hopelessly in his wake, going on
to break .his own Australian record for the quarter-
mile, which he'left behind in sinin. 9 2-ssecs., or
2 1-5 secs, bettc . He is evidently a greatly im-
proved swimmer since he left Sydney for a country
life. Beyond doubt, he could have swum the half-
mile seconds faster if there. had been an opponent
to push him. Takaishi’s time was llmin. 25 2-ssee.
and J. Kelly, who finished third, recorded llmin.
40sec. Saito, Takaishi’s team mate, started in
the 100 yards State championship, but could not
get a place. E. Henry, the Olympic sprint repre-
sentative, who has been out of the game till recently,
won in 56 3-5 sec. F. Doyle, who holds the Aus-
tralian record of 54 1-5 see., could do no better
than third,, behind Dr. Kirkland. The other cham-
pionship of the day was the 500 yards breaststroke
event for teams. University won from Rose Bay
and Sydney, in 7min. 59sec.
The qualifying heats for the 440yds. championship
of N.S.W. were swum at the Domain baths on
TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING.
BINKS ( proudly but sadly) : “ ’Sno use — l'll have to put
you hack—t daren’t take you home; I'd he too
hig a liar!”
Monday night, “Moss” Christie and “Boy” Charlton
being the respective winners. The race comes off on
Wednesday night after this edition goes to press,
when. Charlton and the Japanese champion, Takaishi,
meet again. The race for the 220yds. championship
at Manly next Saturday will be the final meeting
between the pair. This is Takaishi’s pet distance,
and the short Manly laps (55yds.) will suit him
better than the long Domain stretch.
The Maroubra Speedway programme was
cut short on Saturday night by the fatal accident to
“Phil” Garlick, but not before a new track record
for Australia for any type of motor vehicle had been
made by Harry Peel, whose 8-h.p. (980 c.c.) New
Imperial (British) two-wheeler covered a lap in
29 4-5 sec., involving a speed of a fraction over 103
miles an hour. The previous best was L. P. Rey-
nolds’s lap in 30 seconds, made on a two-wheeler
on the same track months ago. The four-wheelers
have never yet attained 100 miles an hour on
Maroubra, though many of them have a higher
ratio of power to weight than anv motor-cycle. Tim
reason, of course, is that it is well-nigh 'impossible
to drive them at such a speed and keep on the
concrete.
“Phil” Garlick, probably the best-known racing
motorist, in Australia, went off Maroubra Speedway
on Saturday night, carrying an electricdight standard
with him, and was picked up dead. Garliek’s
Alvis had just passed Peter White’s Fronty-Ford at
the top of the bank, and was going on to over-
haul Hope Bartlett’s Sunbeam. Turning into the
straight, which meant running down a dip, one of
the front tyres of the Alvis appeared to burst
under the strain and the car skidded over the bank.
Garlick was killed instantaneously and his car was
utterly wrecked. It was at the same spot that
Salmon and Vaughan crashed to their doom just a
year and a week previously. Garlick, a particularly
fine driver who never took foolish risks, is the
fourth speedster to meet his death on Maroubra,
Dutton, a motor-cyclist, having had a fatal collision
with a post in July last. It is hard to dispute
the contention that the track is not safe for speeds of
over 90 miles an hour—-for four-wheelers, at any
rate —but that is to beg the question as to whether
any track can be made secure against the risks that
beset the racing motorist.
Ivan Laffineur, the French middleweight,
is a bad hurdle for any man of the list. 61b.
class to negotiate, as Ted Monson, the South Aus-
tralian, found once again at Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night. Monson weighed list. 21b. and the
Gaul four ounces more; but the latter was the tra-
ditional ball o' muscle, while Monson looked flabby
about the middle and too meaty over the shoulders.
It was a case of bellows to mend with him as early
as the fourth round. The Frenchman takes his gruel
as if he likes it, and rarely gives ground. Monson
clouted him laboriously and often, but he couldn’t
inflict telling punishment, while every time Laffineur
landed he hurt. Ted waded in several times in
tornadic fashion, but he didn’t pack the necessary
wallop for his task, and Laffineur always came back
with more effective punches. A split eyebrow, sus-
tained in the eleventh round, kept Ted pawing for
vision in nearly every subsequent session, and he
was practically out during the last three terms, only
his splendid pluck keeping him going to the bitter
end. At the close Laffineur secured a well-earned
verdict, but Monson got a merited cheer from the
moderate crowd, too, for his marked gameness.
Gavino de Leon (9st. If lb.) added further to
his reputation, as a hefty clouter when he vanquished
Phil Bayes (9st. 51b.) at Melbourne on Saturday
night. Phil, a product of Oregon, U.S.A., has a
bad habit of meeting an attack with lowered head,
and this unpleasing practice opened a gash over
Gavino’s only good optic in the second round. The
copious flow of blood almost blinded the Filipino
and might have spelled finis for a less game battler.
But Gavino merely felt his way in close and, relying
almost entirely on a heavy body battery, soon had
his opponent slowed down to a walk. Rounds six
and seven in particular were rib-roasters for Phillip,
and the barrage told on him so severely that Vat
Quirk had a busy time over the later stages detach-
ing him. The visitor has not been over the full
course before, and was carrying a lot of surplus
avoirdupois; he may prove a tougher nut next time.
* * * *
Tyneke, the Belgian boxer who put up
such a good performance against McGale in Sydnet
a short time ago, doesn’t believe in using any old
pug as a sparring partner. His wife often puts
on the gloves with him, and is a very fast and agile
fighter. She takes a keen interest in his bouts,
and personally supervises the training department
and the tucker-box.
* * * *
“No. 529”: The recent boom in wrestling
reminds me of an occasion when the alleged cham-
pion of the world arrived at Cape Town and issued
a challenge, which was taken up by a big tramway
man. Trammie was chewing hard when he got on
to the stage to wrastle the invader, and he was in
a desperate plight when it occurred to him to squirt
tobacco juice into the champion’s eye. There was
no more wrestling that night.
* * * *
“The Amateur Pro.” : I note that a Japan-
ese gentleman has been moved to write to the daily,
papers protesting against the way in which his
countrymen, Takaishi and Saito, are being rushed
about the country. He is pained to think that two
amateur sportsman should be so exploited by the
N.S.W. swimming authorities; one night to New-
castle, the next to Wellington, and back again to
make a Sydney holiday. He has my entire sympathy
but he can hardly be expected to understand how
the old spirit of playing the game for the game’s
sake is dying out in Australia. That is not so
much the fault of the players themselves as of
the people who organise sports and games generally.
These, however worthy their original motives, be-
came infected with the lure ,of the big “gate” and
the big money. Our Japanese visitors will note, 1
do not doubt, that a party of Australian cricketers,
claiming to be amateurs - and insisting on being
treated as such, have lately been presented with a
bonus of £250 in addition to an honorarium of
£4OO for their English trip, and are complaining
about the inadequacy of their remuneration. It is
to that sort of “amateurism” that Australian sport
is rapidly tending.
* * * *
“J.H.” (Lond.) : I have seen the Maoris
in most of their -matches; they are a good average
club side, but with little idea of real, old-fashioned
scrummaging, and weak behind the scrum at. half-
back. I was riot surprised at their defeats by
English provincial teams like Gloucester, Devon and
Cornwall, whose' forwards would test a much
stronger side. If N.S.W. wants to emulate the All
Blacks’ record, the selectors will have to make sure
of the scrummages. Big, fast forwards, who can
shove and join ,in with the backs in the open, are
the prime requisite. There can be little doubt that
the average forward in Great Britain to-dav is
capable of holding his own with the very best from
Australia and Maoriland. Meanwhile it cari be placed
to the credit of the Maoris that while they did not
set the English Rugby world alight as the All Blacks
did—their record, of course, doesn’t compare—no side
has been so popular and no set of men better
liked. There wasn’t a single “incident” through-
out the tour, and from start to finish the boys played
the game. The only criticism Ned Parata, the
Maoris’ manager, had to make about English Rugby,
on his departure for France, was that the referees
are a long way behind the best Welsh ones. The
Welshmen, says Parata, have the game on their
finger-ends and are always up with it.
* * * *
The Rugby Union Maoris, having com-
pleted their tour of Britain and France, left for home
via Canada last week. The French R.U., which has
made about £3OO profit on the tour, has presented
the team with the Gallic Chanticleer in bronzb
with a tiny replica for each player. The Ml’
League team is also nearing the end of its tour and
beat a “Cumberland” team by 18 to 3 in a propa-
ganda match at Barrow on Saturday. They also will
fake the Western route home.

Not like the conquerors in bygone clashes

And meet the hero-worship that abashes,
The pseans that enthrall, but still one must
Admit that, though they left behind the Ashes,
They toted home the Dust.

Gamely they took it, too, and debonairly

will be released early in the new year, is said

Leonard Vivian Biggs, who succeeds the

an Englishman acclimatised by 30 years in
Melbourne. After nearly 25 years on the

“Morehead” : Sydney Evening News has

years later it moved further up I itt-street
*(190) into a small shop squeezed in between
an eating-house and a barber’s. The building
was enlarged, and served its purpose until
1885. when the paper moved to Market-
street. The final move was made last year
to the new eight storeys of Bowral trachyte
and Bondi sandstone, next to the Synagogue
in Elizabeth-street.

financially—lie has no head for business,
poor chap—was given a job by liis State
branch of the R.S.L. A local weekly ferreted
out the fact that Larry was connected with
a Is. tipping competition conducted without
authority on R.S.L. premises, and Larry lost
liis job. Sensationalism must have its vic-
tims; and heroes are two a penny now.
“J.H.” (Lond.) : Beaverbrook, proprietor of

tolling their virtues —this in his own papers
—and then to reproduce the story as an
advt. on full pages in rival papers. Hm cir-
culation manager is a young Australian,
Doidge, whose father used to run the local
paper at Cootamundra (N.S.W.).
The cables get stupider and stupider; but
for mild stupidity this one (S. M. Herald,
7/l/'27) still leads:—
Two children, staring with rapt attention at the
Empire Marketing Board’s new poster frame, con-
taining large colored scenes of Dominion Life, by
F. C. Herrick and Norman Wilkinson, which had
just been erected at Whitehall, were unaware tht.,
sharing their enjoyment, the Prince of Wales wu.
standing alongside them.
And, sad to say, the two children may not
know even now that 11.R.H. was standing
beside them. In fact, they may never know.
The incident shows that every Royal person
should have a motor-horn attached to him and
sound it frequently.
When Harry Holland, now leader of the
Maoriland Labor party, was in Sydney
he started the International Socialist
at 119 Goulburn-street. When he crossed
the Tasman W. R. Winspear sat in
the vacant chair, and bis anti-mili-
tarist views led to many police visits to
the premises during the days of censorship.
After having its uninsured premises wholly
destroyed by fire, the International Social-
ist Club, which ow T ned the rag, started a run
of bad luck. Members were interned, de-
ported or “pinched” for anti-war speeches,
and finally the club was suppressed. Mean-
while the printing plant had been handed
over to the Australian Socialist party, which
renamed the paper the International Com-
munist. and carried on under the editor-
ship of Ray Everett. In 1922 a rumpus with
another band of communists in Sussex-streef
led to a dramatic midnight removal of furni
ture and the bursting up of Everett’s party
and the I.C. ended its career under the auc
tioneer’s hammer.
Twenty-eight years ago two members <
the Westralian Assembly met in the refresh
ment-room after a debate, and exchangeo
some hard words and bellicose gestures. N
blow was actually struck, but a highly
colored account of the “fracas,” representing
it as quite a willing scrap, appeared in
several of the goldfields newspapers next
morning. The House grew angry—this was
in the Forrest days—and proceeded to assert
its dignity. The reporter who was credited
with sending the wire was told that the
Parliamentary gallery would bo closed to him
in future. A sub-inspector of police, alleged
to have jocularly exaggerated the incident m
conversation with press roundsmen, was
deprived of his seniority and transferred.
Finally, the chief proprietor and editor of
the Kalgoorlie Miner, the paper that was
supposed to have circulated the fight story
most widely, were summoned to the bat of
the House and officially reprimanded. The
editor (J. W. Kirwan) was elected to the
Chamber 10 years later, and is now Presi-
dent of it. The reporter who was turned
out of the gallery is H. P. Colebatch, W.A. s
recently-knighted ex-Agent-General.

FACTS versus FANCIES
A convincing answer to the question —
Do British Cars and Lorries
meet Australian requirementsT
THE significance of the amazing increase in the sale of British made cars and
lorries in Australia — over 400 per cent, in the last two years — will be
clear to the discriminating Australian motorist.
This one fact alone —a remarkable tribute to British engineering skill and British
workmanship —should completely and forever dispel the erroneous impression,
often repeated, that the design of British cars and lorries is unsuitable for Aus-
tralian conditions.
Years of the closest study of Australian requirements on the part of British Motor
Manufacturers are ingrained in the modern British car — so deeply ingrained
that throughout Australia, British cars and lorries are demonstrating every day and
in no uncertain way their complete mastery over the worst possible conditions.
Price — power — endurance — unequalled economy of operation — all the fac-
tors most vital to the motorist or business man point unerringly to British cars
and British lorries as the greatest values in the Motor World to-day.
Buy a British car or lorry —not solely because it is British — but because if is best.
These illustrations, drawn to scale,
represent the remarkable progress
made by British motor vehicles in
the Australian market.
Can any facts be more convincing!

For a change a Sydney audience was in-
troduced to a group of Americans who don t
overwork humor about the futility of their
country’s liquor laws, or cultivate the belief
that every woman is entitled to a spare hus-
band or so, when “Cobra” was let loose at
the Sydney Criterion on Saturday. Cer-
tainly it is to much more than a spare
husband or so that Elise Van Zile (Judith
Anderson) helps herself. Blit the play is
set upon that high pedestal of righteousness
which is so conspicuous in honest melo-
drama ; even Jack Race, though inclined to
be led astray by every designing minx with
an inclination for passionate dalliance, ex-
presses shame at his own escapades. When
the intriguing Elise descends upon the college
chambers of Jack, she immediately starts to
fascinate him; but learning that his chum
Tony Doming is the real owner of the
chambers and all the in sight, she
changes her play to that of a simple country
girl, tenderly distressed about her aunt’s
sprained ankle. The shy millionaire, hitherto
unconcerned about women, falls an easy
victim ; the second act finds the soulless sliiek-
ess married to Tony, but determinedly pur-
suing his friend Jack and beating down the
barriers of his resistance in a scene in which
Judith Anderson showed amazingly serpentine
qualities. The snake-lady’s wooing is spurred
by the knowledge that Jack has curbed his
old amorous habits for a year as a sort of
moral preparation for a proposal to Judith
Drake; but he tears himself away from
the arms of the temptress, leaving her in the
hotel to which she has lured him —to bo
destroyed in a fire which guts the place. So
Jack achieves happy matrimony later on;
and peace of mind comes to Tony when he
learns that the woman he thought Elise to
be never had a real existence.
* * * *
The acting is limited to six characters, and
without the superb work of Judith Anderson
the opening performance would have been

flat. She showed a delightful comedy sense
in the first act (that is when Elise changes
her character to fascinate a different man) ;
in the second act she was restrained,
and yet so full of passion that she made con-
vincing a scene that might easily have been
made grotesque. Michael Hogan was a
deluded husband who grew over-hysterical
when torn with anxiety about the disappear-
ance of his wife, but that was as much the
play’s fault as Hogan’s; and Henry Daniel I
made a fairly convincing Jack Race. Sibyl
Jane, who was here with “The Farmer's
Wife” co., represented Feminine Virtue in the
person of Judith Drake. She was tame ex-
cept in the scene of the husband’s distress
at his wife’s disappearance, which she lifted
well. Olga Lee, over-emphasising the .“loud-
ness” of the young adventuress, Sophie Bin-
ner, whose mission is to open the play by
exposing the susceptibility of Jack Race,
lias the only line in the piece that should be
cut out; and Leslie Victor—well, this Show-
man cannot remember Victor being guilty of
an inartistic bit of stage work since he was
Cayley Brummie in Brough’s “Second Mrs.
Tanqueray” over 25 years ago. This time he
made a cameo of a small part.
* * * *
Sullivan took the upper hand in the part-
nership when “The Yeomen of the Guard’’
was written; Gilbert. forgot for the moment
that he was a quipster. Nevertheless he
lived up to the musician by supplying lyrics
to match the music. So, although it is tem-
porarily forgotten that God gave a chorus
feet to dance upon, “The Yeomen,” with its
mass of fine melody and choruses, and its
resemblance to grand opera maintained in
the story, will probably be one of the most
popular of the revivals. It gives a fine sing-
ing opportunity to Strella Wilson also;
although she is too massive to look the part
of Elsie Maynard, the circumstance was
overlooked when she sent her notes search-
ing into the hearts of her audience. Her
only failure was in the magnificent finale
of the first act, when, in her “Mercy” song,
she emitted more voice than tenderness.
Charles Walenn was the Jack Point, a rather
pointless Point in places, but excellent in
the “I Have a Song to Sing, O” number,
and pathetic in the closing scene as the heart-
broken lover. As Colonel Fairfax, James
Ilay faced death with fortitude, and sang
well enough, but was inclined to fall out of
character; and Jack Ralston's fried-fish
voice, so suitable for sentimentalising, did
not fit the part of the gaoler Shadbolt.
Lance Fairfax was brisk and business-like
as the Lieutenant of the Tower; and Ber-
nard Manning—who stood out of “The Gon-
doliers” —was a good Sergeant Meryll. Of
the women, Winifred Williamson, with a
young voice that passes the lie to her “old”
make-up, gave Dame Carrutliers dignity;
and Mabel Gibson, who opened with indis-
tinct articulation, possibly owing to nervous-
ness, did the “Were I Thy Bride”—song and
business—gracefully.

An audience that travels by boat: —
This year’s instalment of sightseeing American
millionaires and near-millionaires gave Sydney
a turn for two days at the end of last week;
and now they will be .able to tell their
friends in the U.S.A. ahl about it. Some of the
people who are opulently voyaging on the Carinthia
are not ashamed of being millionaires. The flash
of jewels in the sunlight brought a grotesque re-
minder of the old-time pug who, in the new affluence
of ring victories, bought a dress-suit and wore it
in the daytime. But not all the visitors are
like that. They are a mixed lot, whose common
bond is' the ownership of dollars; there is the
proprietor of a chain of 15 papers; there is a
jewel merchant who handles rubies as though the}
were mere potatoes ; there is an estate-agent who is
director of 28 building and loan societies; there is
a man who makes nails, millions and millions of
nails. Not all the crowd joined in the mass-forma-
tion rush, mainly in motor-cars, over the Sydney
landscape, and “did” a routine round which included
the Abo. reserve at La Perouse, the races and the
Zoo. A solitary, adrift from the rushing avalanche,
with a chicken sandwich in one hand and a bottle
in the other, inspected the skulls at the Museum; a
few scattered themselves through the Art Gallery and
the Gardens. Those people who really did want to
see the place they were visiting must have found the
two days rather a crush.
h*
“Rose Marie” now has a record of 1000
performances in two cities; and on
the night which registered the 260th
showing in Sydney it had its 740th in London.
And its end at Sydney Majesty’s is still
only a vague rumor. The Palace sees a
change next week, however; “Abie’s Irish
Rose,” which will have had a run of 13
weeks, finishes on Wednesday night; on the
following Saturday “White Cargo” will be
delivered for a short return season. Only
the two main pantomimes remain in Sydney
now —or will when “Cinderella” packs away
her slipper in the property boxes of the New-
town Majestic to-morrow (Firday) night.
Nothing is in sight to supplant the exploits
of “Jack and the Beanstalk,” which is the
goose that lays the golden eggs for the Fuller
management at the St. James. “Aladdin,”
which commences business at 7.45 nightly at
the G.0.H., has seen changes. Marie Breminer
was rushed from the “Rose Marie” co. to
take the place, as principal girl, of Vera
Spaull, who has not been abld to appear
owing to illness; but bright Billie Lockwood
now fills the part, Marie being wanted back
with her own show. The only thing to sug-
gest that “Aladdin” will cease rubbing his
lamp to the profit of the management is the
announcement that the Neil Comedy Com-
pany is coming back, this time with “The
Nervous Wreck.” But that is not until
March.

Moore and Shy provide one of the most
remarkable contrasts seen at the Sydney
Tivoli, one of them being elephantine whilst
the other is a midget with short comedy legs.
The -, turn depends entirely upon these phy-
sical contrasts; but there is something laugh-
compelling in seeing a mountain of nesh
shake with mirth, and the turn is likely to
be popular. Dixon and O’Brien, who have
to resort to burnt cork to present ‘ A park-
town Wedding,” show again that imitation
coons can be much more interesting than the
real article; and the Stavannys are a pair
of Swedish equilibrists who present them-
selves as passable statuary, and do daring
deeds in acrobatics. The Santreys their
original 17 reduced to 12—are fsirewelling
with a turn which lias become a trifle ragged
and lost the polish of the earlier perfor-
mances.

Nat Hanley, who heads the Zig-Zag Revue
Co. at Fullers’ (Sydney), displays liis ver-
satility in an encounter with a -piano, which
he handles expertly; and that is one of the
most interesting bits in a change of pro-
gramme which maintains the usual quality
of fun. The Veterans of Variety still stir
the echoes of old memories; and a new arrival
is Bebe Kesslova, described as a gipsy vio-
linist, who certainly lets loose a great deal
of emotion and some pleasant melody.

The search for the week’s picture; —
“Paris” is the intriguing title of a finely dramatic
film now showing in Sydney at the Strand. lo
Paris comes a gay youth with a cheerful heart, full
pockets and a longing for adventure. He finds his
adventure in a sordid caffe. He finds, too, a beautiful
girl of the slums, and —unhappily for himself —the
girl’s lover, a sleek, handsome apache hiding from
the police. Passion binds the lovers; but the cheery
American trifler fatuously intervenes; and the youth
gives himself up, to the gendarmes to serve his term
and return to his light o’ love free. Meantime the
American intruder looks after the girl, but in a
strictly platonic fashion. They don’t love in America
as they do in Paris. Naturally, when the lover is
released he misinterprets the cosy fittings of the
apartment provided by the irresponsible American.
Cut passion flies to passion; and in the dramatic
ending the gay intruder admits that Paris isn’t like
his own home town. The sensuous scenes in which
the two French lovers figure are startlingly con-
vincing. This drama gets as near to real life and
real, drama as the film—and the regulations—permit.
There are approximately 11 kinds of kisses in the
love scenes, all most convincingly done. Evidently
the regulations made and provided have, been reluc-
tantly extended of late. The lovers, Charles Raj
and Joan. Crawford, make an ideal Romeo and Juliet
of the caffes.
Wilde without his epigrams—only a movie director
could conceive, and present,-such a painful paradox!
“Lady Windermere’s Fan,” now showing at the
Sydney Lyceum and the Lyric, lacks the main
feature of the author’s intent —the spice of wit
and the pepper of epigrams that gave this famous
play, so enticing a flavor. All the producer has
attained is a crude society drama —set in or near
the period of its first production—in its way just
as interesting as all the other plays in which a
woman is found at night in the wrong room. Mrs.
Erlynne is played by Irene Rich, and the production
and cast are good. But it isn’t at all Wilde.
“The Best People” in place of “Meet the
Wife,” at the Atlienamm on Saturday, is the
only major change threatened on Melbourne's
amusement menu. “The Nine Nice Ameri-
cans” who opened the piece have dwindled
to 4’ve or six with the passage of the mail-
boats, so it will be necessary to enlist Aus-
tralian substitutes, one of whom will be
Beatrice Day. The play is not expected to
lose anything on this account. Renee
Eloise Kelly, as “The Naughty Wife,” is
still mixing her lover and her husband in
the same honeymoon at Melbourne King’s.
“Puss in Boots” is at the Princess, and
“Sinbad” at the Playhouse; and, not to be
outdone, “The Hottentot,” at the Palace,
is claiming to be as funny as a panto. Audi-
ences say they like “Pins and Needles” at
the Royal; and the managerial announce-
ments don’t say a single word against it,
either.
** * *
Marjory Hicklin is now endeavoring to
excite interest in the passion of Julia van
Osteren for the Cousin from Nowhere at
His- Majesty’s, Melbourne. The new lady
differs from her predecessor in the parr,
Maud Fane, in having a less vigorous per-
sonality and more shingle. The georgeous
yellowness of her coiffure helps the spectator
to forget the light nature of the voice beneath
it, and forgetfulness is needed when the
voice is joined with Claude Flemming’s rich
and amorous bellow. Claude Flemming
tends to overdo the amorousness a trifle,
but as everything in the piece looks rich and
overdone the matter escapes notice. The
attempt of the authors to return to old
standards of comic opera by introducing
singing dialogue and suchlike prehistoric
devices is a little pathetic; still, it is an
attempt and ought to be encouraged, especi-
ally as the melody is frequently pleasant.
❖* * *
Beresford Fowler’s latest contribution to
the artistic renaissance in Melbourne is the
story of the humble but virtuous maiden who
captivates with her mainly apocryphal
charms the scion of a noble house; of the
hero composed throughout of stainless steel,
who marries the maiden against his mothers
wish; of the indignation of mamma, a bad-
tempered dowager who talks about her
ancient tree like a mental-asylum inmate suf-
fering from delusions of grandeur; of the
doings of the comic major who would prey
upon the heroine’s elder sister if his Better
Nature were not ever at his elbow to keep
him in the path of virtue; of the sad vicissi-
tudes of the billet of firewood draped in a
shawl which does duty for the heroine’s baby;
of the peregrinations to the corner pub of the
heroine’s vulgar dad, driven by booze to pur-
loin the baby’s necklace; of the death of the
hero at the wars and the discovery later
that the said death was exaggerated; and
of the final reconciliation, when everybody
discovers that there is good as well as bad
in everybody else —except the crapulous papa,
who is sent to the Jersey Islands with a
pension of £2 a week to drink himself to
death. This is the theme of “Caste.” It
would be wrong to be really rude to this
ancient and overworked moke, which was
worth trotting out of the stables of
the past if only for its historical interest.
For it was written over 60 years ago and in
the dictionary sense is a genuine repertory
play. Its author, T. W. Robertson (now,
alas! forgotten dust), was regarded in his
“PINS AND NEEDLES,” AT
MELBOURNE ROYAL.
Ada Reeve, as the caretaker in “The Empty
House,” sings a song about “mother’s
ruin.”
time as a cross between an Ibsen, a Piran-
dello and a Shaw, an image-buster who punc-
tured the artificial conventions of the age
and blew the wind of a wholesome realism
into them. The piece is a quaint mixture of
Shakspearean soliloquy and declamation and
bits of almost modern naturalism.
* * * *
The Little Art Co. worked as hard at it
as country housewives. John Cameron was
a beautiful hero who went off to quell the
Indian Mutiny in a Gallipoli veteran’s uni-
form; and Beresford Fowler, Mona Pepyat
and Bruce Henderson, in a really fine drama-
tic passage, broke the news of his return
to Ilettie Feuerman, who clothed the Early-
■ Victorian heroine in much emotion and abbre-
viated skirts.

A phenomenon at Melbourne Bijou is a
lady who fiddles standing on her feet instead
of on her head. She fiddles rather well.
Estelle Rose is an impersonator of Yiddish
roles, whose artistic turn is not treated to
as much applause as it deserves. Alec Kelle-
way dons naval uniform and sings in a
showy tenor of the alleged delights of Shang-
hai for the British sailorman; there is a
juggler of rich appearance but moderate
means, and George Wallace is immersed in
a fresh revue; finally an American youth,
with a voice like a steel-wire guitar, is being
rapturously received by those who like
American youths with voices like steel-wiri
guitars.

A Russian grand duchess who marries a
Bolshevik and spends the rest of the film
in New Jersey is an unusual visitor to
Hoyt’s Melbourne screen. Corinne Griffith
is the unconventional heroine and “Into
Her Kingdom” is the title of the piece.
“The Fighting Edge,” a yarn about the
industry of smuggling human contraband
from Mexico into U.S.A., is a thrill at the
Majestic.

Poverty
Point
“Ell”: “L.F.8.” (B. 30/12/’2G) surely
strays in giving Oscar Asche chief credit
for Gladys Moncrieff’s success, for she had
already scored heavily in “Maid of the Moun-
tains” in a part right into her hands and
was an accomplished performer when “The
Southern Maid” was produced. The Queens-
land girl was bound to succeed in Australia,
where good singing voices are demanded by
the public, no matter how light the produc-
tion may be. In London they are not quite
so insistent about the voice in the more
frivolous shows, provided the performer is a
good-looker and has charm.
“Macko” : I don’t give a tinker’s anathema
who discovered Gladys Moncrieff, but all
credit must go to George Highland for his
dogged insistence on making her a star. He
plainly stated that unless she played lead in
“May Time” and “Katinka” he would not
produce either show. With infinite patience
this great man coached her, polishing and
improving each effort. I don’t know of an-
other prima donna in Australia who could so
worthily have filled the shoes of Jose Col-
A FAST HITCH.
GERT : “Oh, I’m sure you could do great
things. Why don’t you hitch your
waggon to a star?”
BERT : “Er—I did, you know. And the bally
old star wouldn’t leave go of it, and I
haven’t seen either her or my limousine
since.”
lins in “Southern Maid” ; but Gladys Mon-
crieff was a sophisticated performer years
before Oscar Asche “gave her a chance” in
that opera.
“Arthur R.”: Melbourne’s new theatre, to
be built by the Firm opposite His Majesty’s
in Exhibition-street, will occupy the historic
site of the Iron Pot. Here Sheridan’s plays
were produced, interspersed with local efforts
and vaudeville. It was during a season ot
the latter that a stampede occurred because
the management refused to let a popular
vocalist sing “Jim Crow” four times in suc-
cession. The audience wrecked the internal
fittings of the place, and shattered the crude
lighting system. Many years, later Cole, of
“Bohemian” fame, pitched liis camp on the
site and produced a long series of thrillers.
“T.P.O’C.”: The new Empire Theatre
isn’t the first playhouse in Sydney to be so
called. The old Opera House in King-street
—turned into a warehouse 20-odd years ago
—had that name under a vaudeville manage-
ment for a time, and when the show went to
the end of King-street where the Bankruptcy
Court, functions, the name went with them.
Later the Fullers turned the old Standard
Theatre in Castlereagli-street into the
Empire, and for 12 months or so it paid
their bills. M.L. then called them to more
profitable fields. With their departure the
old name was restored. Subsequently it be-
came the Little under the management
of Hugh Buckler. Will the day ever arrive
when an Australian theatre will get an
Australian name?
“A.8.C.” : Arnold Ridley, author of “The
Ghost Train,” which E. J. Carroll will soon
produce, was a shell-shocked product who
tried school-teaching, acting and working in
liis father’s boot business before he took up
the pen. This was the first of his plays to
be produced; and it was sold within a week
of its writing. “The King of Mud,” a later
effort dealing with village life, has been pro-
nounced “rather better than usual” by the
critics. When called upon to make a curtain
speech, he looked wildly around and fled,
saying, “This is no time for talking.” It
never is. H. H. Mulcaster, who came to
Australia to play in “Bulldog Drummond,”
gained favorable mention in the production.
“Goldilocks”: Apparently the critics were
invited when the Melbourne _ girl Wilma
Berkeley stepped for a night into the shoes
of the liard-to-manage Jose Collins in “The
Greek Slave” at the King’s Theatre, Glas-
gow. The cable reports that they raved
about her, hailing her as a new star. What-
ever suspicions this enthusiasm arouses in
the circumstances, it is all to the young
lady’s good. Nowadays in Australia under-
studies frequently step into the shoes of their
principals without a word of explanation or
apology. In Britain the understudy gets a
much fairer chance.
“C Ockney” : I agree with “Darned Moun-
seer” (B. 6/l/’27) that the “Ruddigore”
music and libretto are “beyond reproach.
Also, I think that the “Darned Mounseer
song is one of the best numbers in the piece,
and one of the most original, inasmuch as
the tenor singer has to dance a hornpipe at
tlie finish. Durward Lely, the orgiual Dick
Dauntless, recently told in the Gilbert and
Sullivan Journal how the dance came to
be interpolated. “It sounds as though a
hornpipe should follow,” remarked Lely
innocently when the music had been played
over at the first rehearsal. Gilbert only
grunted, but a few days later told the tenor
to go to Paul Valentine, the ballet-master,
and learn the steps. When he was perfect
\Sullivan wrote the music, and the hornpipe
was one of the most joyful surprises of the
first night.
“Cornstalk”: Temporarily hushed are the
frequent outcries against the Firm’s lack
of encouragement of local mummers. In
the G. and S. co. we have quite ci bunch.
Strella Wilson was born in Broken Hill; Effie
Armstrong and Patti Russell were Sydney
Con. students ; Byrl Walkley, the Newcastle
contralto of the last G. and S. crowd, has
since proved her mettle in other companies
and is now well established. Jack Ralston
is a local product and a splendid one. James
Hay is an Adelaide boy; Lance Fairfax, the
delightful young baritone, comes from Christ-
church. He studied in London after sever-
ing from the M.L. forces and started out
in the Tivoli revues. Dick Shortland, assis-
tant producer, is a product of the Sydney
North Shore line, where Elved Jenkins
(Charlie Walenn’s understudy 1 has also
spent most of his years, though born in
Wales.
“Alwyn”: Walenn, Jack Point of “The
Yeomen of the Guard,” is one of a family
of 19 children (14 living)—all musicians.
Chief of them are Gerald, the violin expert on
the Sydney Con. staff, and Arthur (baritone)
and Herbert (’cellist), professors on the staff
of the Royal Academy of Music, London.
Herbert’s old pupils include Mischel Cherni-
avski, Boris Hambourg and Laurie Kennedy.
“Cornstalk”: At one time Charles R.
Walenn was understudy to the great Gilbert
and Sullivan comedian George Thorne, and
Thorne used to coach him privately in the
parts. Walenn has done the same thing
with his young Sydney understudy, Elved
Jenkins, who was a clever amateur a year
ago.
“W.E.F.”: Bernard Shaw again! In
reply to a group of amateurs who recently
wanted to stage “You Never Can Tell,” he
wrote: “Amateurs cannot perform my plays.
Professionals cannot unless I am there to help
them. But by all means try to do it if you
want to—and God help the audience !”
“Yarra Ben”: Henry Russell, who paid
a short visit to this country with the last
Melba Grand Opera co.—he was “artistic
director”—has written a book, “The Passing
Show,” which has a passing interest for
Australian readers. In Melbourne he was
considerably worried by flies, and he tells
the world: “Such is the affliction that nearly
everybody wears flynets, looking exactly like
great, green insects themselves.” But he
forgot, to mention, the coat-of-mail that every-
one dons to prevent puncture by the poisoned-
spears of the aborigines of Collingwood.
“Omega”: Just another instance of fiction
anticipating fact. In The Bulletin of
23/9/’2G Bernard Cronin had a story con-
cerning a man who had two voices—alto
and bass. From Vienna word comes of a
woman who, following an operation on the
A WORSE TROUBLE STILL.
SUCCESSFUL ACTOR: “N o, sir, I’ll not take a
taxi. Dr. Macquarie Jones tells me that I
must walk after my meals.”
UNSUCCESSFUI DITTI: “Ah, well, it might be
worse. I’ve had t o chase after mine all
my life.”
throat, found herself ■ possessed of two voices
-—tenor and soprano. Unlike the hero of
Cronin's story, who used his voices in con-
certo, the lady employs one voice at a time,
but can change from one to the other at will.
She lias accepted an operatic engagement to
sing two roles.
“Hamfat” : A pre-Christmas slump yearly
strikes the city theatres ; but it is nothing to
the wintry times that come to the theatrical
co. on tour when the affluent citizens are
preparing for a holiday in the nearest metro-
polis. A show that has landed back in
Sydney in a crippled condition had such a
rough passage that in 18 playing nights—
according to one member, still cheerful
though as broke as usual —not £6O was
taken. “You must have found it pretty
rotten playing to such houses?” I said. “The
publicans and hall-owners and newspapers
must have found it pretty rotten,” he
cheerfully retorted.
“Flaming Youth”: Harry Tighe, who has
had a play, “Open Spaces,” staged at Lon-
don’s “Q” Theatre, has not seen Australia
for years. Like Albert Dorrington, he took
his writing gift to London, and sub-
merged himself in moderate prosperity. He
has written a shelf of books that have made
no wide sensation ; “The Four Candles” is
probably the best. Tighe was born 50 years
ago in Waratah ; and this is his first promis-
ing dramatic outbreak.
“Bis”: How’s this for battling? During
my career as an advance agent I hit Grafton
ahead of a vaudeville show that had more
optimism than finance and billing. My
“paper” was 200 dodgers, still to be paid for
at the last town, a little white newsprint, a
bottle of printer’s ink and a brush. Arrived
in the town at 4 p.m. with 4d. I wired in.
Bluff got me the hall without the usual
deposit; a lucky illness put the billposter out
of action, allowing me to do my own billing;
and my luggage was sufficient to keep the
hotel satisfied. Result: Town billed three
days ahead and a £2O house.
“Leybis”: “Ramming” is a part of the
side-show profession. A pro. who gets
in on the nod to any of the vaudeville shows
and encores every act is a “ram” or “ramster.”
But this type can’t beat the professional
ram who follows the side-shows around the
country. His is a well-paid job; sometimes he
gets more than the principals. Among the
boxing-booths the art receives careful atten-
tion. When the spruiker boasts that any
0 f his men can “out” the locals in one round,
the supposed mug butts in. He is taken no
notice of until he begins to abuse the boxers.
Then the fun starts. The locals, believing
the ram to be a hand from one of the near-
by farms, hear of large wagers made until
the lookers-on crowd in to see the big fight,
The boxer is invariably knocked out by .the
mug, who is then induced to take on the
heavyweight, with results arranged to suit
the temperament of the crowd and future
houses. I have seen over £lOO handed to
a mug in one day. But the cash finds its
way back to the manager s pocket; and the
rain is reimbursed according to previous
arrangements. There are two classes of
rams, the humorous and the serious; and
both draw big houses.
“Morehead”: A new Hauptmann
play is regarded on the Euro-
pean Continent as an event
as important as a coronation.
When Reinhardt, prince of stage-
managers and producers, put on
Hauptmann’s latest, “Dorothea An-
germann,” in Vienna, theatrical man-
agers and critics from all over
Europe travelled thither to be pre-
sent on the first night. The plot
deals with the love of the daughter
of a pastor of a German provincial
town for a savant named Pfann-
sclimeid. She is also mixed up with
a cook who seduces her, and when
her papa declares that she must
marry the Knight of the Gas Stove
she bolts for New York. After a
series of emotional ups-and-downs
she returns heart-broken to her
native village to commit suicide.
Despite its gloom, the play was later
produced simultaneously in 17 Ger-
man towns. Still, I don’t see it
making a hit here; even Repertory
bodies fight shy of Hauptmann.
“Pel”; Moscovitch’s liberties with
Yiddish custom (B. 30/12/’26)
remind me that it was he who gave
us Shylock as a benign and saiflly
misunderstood “Uncle.” More re-
cently he gave us an Irish priest
who looked like the gentleman turn-
ing his head away in the “Say
when!” advt., and whose brogue was
a blend of Cockney-Americanese.
The same play, “They Knew What
They Wanted,” produced a Yankee
I.WAV. man with an Oxford accent,
and a ’Frisco teashop girl with a
Lancashire twang. Moscovitch him-
self always chooses a “foreign” char-
acter, because his English is
“broken” and always the same.. I
wonder if all this really is art.
“Philm Up”: After all, the best acting in
American pictures is done by Britisb-born
mummers- —-Charlie Chaplin, H. B. Warner,
Ronald Colman, Percy Marmont, Ernest
Torrance. And an equally good showing has
been made by Australian leading ladies—
Sylvia Bremer, Dorothy Cummings and Enid
Bennett, for example.
“Hamfat”: Magician Harry Houdini
didn’t die exactly penniless, but one of the
biggest parts of his estate was _ his. “half-
million-dollar library.” Houdini willed it
to the Library of Congress on condition that
his name will be perpetuated with the gift.
The library is probably the most complete
collection of books upon necromancy in the
world. Houdini spent much of the last
years of his life in exposing spiritualists.-
“X.D.”: American papers are ask' :
whether Harry Houdini left any expla i! >-
tion of the many things in his “magic” th •
still remain mysteries. One of his mystciv
ous performances was his escape from th
cell in Washington Gaol in which the assassin
of President Garfield had been confined. .■ It
■was considered the last word in safe-deposits:
but at the time appointed Houdini had
vanished. The man who spent so much i' •
exposing the spiritualists, asserting that
could surpass their best efforts with sh.
trickery, should certainly have left som
explanation of how it could be done.
“Tabs”: Bert Royal and one-night stands
are the travelling mummer’s outstanding im-
pressions of a tour in the Shivery Isles.
Despite his silvery hair and Don Quixote
beard, a youthful spirit has enabled Royal P
be in charge of the destinies of J.C.W. and
the Taits for so long that even Tallis is a
newcomer compared w’ith him. Don’t think
that he has spent all his time welcoming, or
soothing temperamental stars, or arranging
the tour from Auckland to the Bluff. He
has written dozens of pantomimes for the
Firm, his “Matsa” being one of the most suc-
cessful ever produced. In this he collaborated
with J.C.W. himself. The Egyptian theme
of the piece was a splendid excuse for Royal
to delve into the research he loves so well.
Away from his cares at the Wellington
G.0.H., he occupies his time keeping his
priceless collection of butterflies up to dab
and adding to his gallery of art treasures.
He is a connoisseur in water-color, antiques,
old coins and Pomeranian dogs.
THE PANTOMIME BOY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An adorable joy is the pantomime boy;
but I ask you, in truth, does she look like a youth?
For she always preserves her bounteous curves,
And no one can make in her sex a mistake,
And her well-rounded limb is a challenge to him.
She appears in the whirl emphatic’ly Girl.
All traditions she wrecks—she’s the last of her sex!
For the maid that you meet every day on the street
Goes as close as she can to imitate man;
Her hair on the top is a masculine crop,
And her figure of late is so slender and straight
That she really might be not a She but a He.
But the panto, preserves the delectable curves
Of that relic of joy, the pantomime boy!

The lower returns for October and November were due to the uncer-
tainty in the minds of the public caused by the alteration of the wave
length of Farmer’s, Ltd. (2F.C.) Station on October 2 from 1100 metres
to 442 metres. The necessary adjustments caused much interference with
the programmes from other stations, and this had the effect of inducing
the public to delay purchases until broadcasting conditions returned to
normal.
The adverse conditions have now disappeared, and the new wave length
will have the effect of largely increasing the demand for the moderately-
priced receiving-sets.
The benefit of the reduced wave length has already been felt, and this
will be still more marked this year.
The sudden drop in sales in October and the recovery in November
clearly explain what happened.
On the average certified sales for the past four months, the figures for
which include two months of temporarily reduced sales, the turnover per
annum, without allowing for any expansion at all, is estimated to be
£100.207.
The last audited accounts —for the period from lltli September, 1925,
to 31st August, 1926 —showed that on a turnover of £35,417/0/3 a net
profit of £6165 (excluding interest) was earned. This earning is at the
rate of 17.4 per cent, on sales, which, on the basis of turnover mentioned
above ( i.e ., £100.267), would represent a net profit of .. .. £17,446
From this should be deducted Managing Director’s Salary,
Income-Tax, Allowance for amortisation of Lease, etc. .. .. 6,383
Leaving £11.063
which would be sufficient to pay 25 per cent, on £40,000, and allow a balance
of £1063 to be placed to reserve.
We say £40,000 because the figures above are based on an average
monthly turnover of some £8355, and £40,000 would be adequate capital
to cope with that turnover. However, the rate of expansion has been so
rapid as to make it necessary to secure a much larger capital in order to
handle the business as it increases.
The Directors feel confident that a net profit of 25 per cent, per annum
can be earned on capital invested.
J
A Balance Sheet,, just
to hand, covering sthe
quarter Sept., Oct.tand
-A ov. shows a net’pro-
fit'of £3267/6/6 (ex-
cluding interest).
This is considerably
higher than the esti-
mates opposite—being
at the rate of
£13,069/6/- per an-
num, and was earned,
in spite of the lower
sales figures of October,
and November.

Dear Sir, —
The Sales figures for the eleven (11) months ended 30tli November, 15)26, as quoted in the Prospectus, have been examined by us and we certify them t-n be
in accordance with the books and records. J UJirat

This Share Issue is, for solidity and wealth of opportunity, one of the most attractive in the financial
history of Australia. The general public is seldom given an opportunity to take up, at par, the shares of an
established concern in an industry which has no equal in regard to the possibilities of the future.
The Company already is doing a flourishing business at 140 Castlereagh Street, Sydney. There-
fore, the prospectus discusses not merely what the Company proposes to do, but what it has done and
is doing. The substantial profits and remarkable achievements of the past afford the best confidence
to investors for the future. In this respect this share issue differs fundamentally from many others"
which depend for their success merely on anticipation and promise.
Immediate application should be made to the Secretary,
The Australian Wireless Co. Ltd
140 CASTLEREAGH STREET, SYDNEY.

The Main Leyland Factory — Leyland, Lancashire, England.
CONSISTENCY
With a long record of undoubted leadership in its field,
and a product scientifically tested from the raw material
up, Leyland presents a twofold consistency.
The number of Leyland Lorries in Australia still continu-
ing to deliver satisfactory service after years of constant
gruelling work forms further tangible proof of Leyland
consistency.
Intrinsic worth and intrinsic quality, coupled with that
forward-looking policy with which Leyland has become
identified, have originated a chassis that cannot well be
improved.
Leyland consistently features all that is New and Labor
Saving in the Lorry world, based on the sturdy, depend-
able, consistent Leyland Chassis.

“Hermes”: Between the 13th and 23rd of
December 54.577 bags of mail matter were
despatched from Sydney G.P.0., and 38,898
bags were received. The letters handled
totalled 14,687.597, parcels 447,197, and
registered articles 143,501. These figures
constitute a record for Christmas mail. About
700 men were engaged at the Central-square
P.O. during the Christmas week. The hum
of voices and date-stamping machines within
the building never ceased, day or night; as
one staff ceased duty a fresh one commenced.
The department this Christmas went to con-
siderable trouble to induce the public to post
their matter early, arid, though the public
responded pretty well, there was still an
avalanche of business on the last four days.
“Burralong” : Though one can't nowadays
get a three-course meal for 3d. in Sydney,
there are compensations. For many years I
have worn boots or shoes of patent colt. Until
a few years ago I always had to pay 455.
or 50s. a pair. Gradually prices have come
down, despite the fact that we now make
better patent-leather than ever, and that the
industry pays good wages and there is no
talk of sweating, as there used to be when
this class of footwear was imported and ex-
pensive. Three months ago I struck the nadir
of shoe-prices when 1 bought a pair of sound
patent colts in Sydney for 14s. lid., and they
are wearing as well as the highest-priced
shoes I ever bought.
“Kriz” (Broome) : A foreign queen is
said to possess a 40-grain pearl found in
Nor’-Westralian waters. It is a round and
perfect gem. Before it reached its present
owner it passed through three dealers’ hands,
each making a good profit. The final figure
is said to have been in the vicinity of
£25,000. Back in the “good old days” many
fine gems were found in Nor’-West waters,
and • were usually given a name, such as
Star of the West, Southern Cross, etc. It was
the custom for the lucky owner to treat all
who happened to be hanging round the bar
of the Pearlers’ Arms to champagne; but.
although just as fine gems are now fished,
they don’t give ’em a name any more.
With the taxation people waiting to hop
in, the lucky pearler just trots round to the
nearest pub and celebrates silently in beer.
“Bildad” : It just shows how the world is
given to discrepancies. Thus in The Bul-
letin of 3.6/12/’26, “Feng-Shui’s” name was
appended to this glorification of his favorite
and interminable Chinaman :-
The quiet progress of our Celestial brother. .. .
In the last 10 years, which have been years of con-
tinual upheaval, he has increased his shipping tonnage
from 20 to 32 millions, and now owns 25 per cent,
of the fleet which trades up and down his magnifi-
cent waterwavs and overseas to foreign ports, exceed-
ing those of the French, American, Dutch, German
and all other nations except the Japanese and
British. During the same period he has developed
his shipbuilding to a point where he can fill all
his own requirements.
The mercliaut shipping-list for 1925-26 is
part of one of the cheapest and best known
and most comprehensive annual books of
reference in the English language. It says
that Chinese-owned shipping amounts to
269,937 tons. Shipowning countries ranked
in tliis order: United Kingdom, United
States, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, the
British Dominions (the list lumps them
together, and I lack the energy to trace
them all separately), Norway, Holland,
Sweden, Spain, Denmark, Greece, Belgium,
Brazil, Russia, Portugal and China. Argen-
tina comes close behind. The list shows no
country in the world with 32 million tons of
shipping. The United Kingdom is credited
with 19,440.711 tons. China is vaguely
alleged to have one-fourth of the world s
population, but as a shipowner it is behind
both Canada and Australia.

The Amazing Profits of
(1) Motor Finance (2) Cash Orders.
In all the world of investments—in the whole list of public companies floated in Australia
within the past twenty years, there is not one company capable of earning such amazing profits
or whose shares promise such big dividends as Motor & Cash Orders, Limited.
THIS IS THE ONLY COMPANY which combines TWO of the world’s greatest and most
profitable finance undertakings under one management. Other finance companies
handle only ONE.
THIS IS THE ONLY COMPANY which commences its operations with £lOO,OOO worth
of highly profitable and sound business. There is no spade work to be done—no
business to be built up—no period of inaction. The business is waiting for the capital
—the capital does not have to wait for the business.
THIS IS THE ONLY COMPANY commencing a finance business with highly-qualified experts
in charge of each of its two departments—motor finance and cash orders.
17-2 P ei * cent, can be earned by the Company using only the money you invest.
47-h per cent, can be earned by the Company where it utilises £3 of borrowed money for every
£1 of your capital.
67g per cent, can be earned by the Company where it utilises £5 of borrowed money for every
£1 of your capital.
CAN YOU REALISE NOW WHY FINANCE COMPANIES EARN SUCH HIGH PROFITS
FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS, AND WHY THIS COMPANY HANDLING BOTH
MOTOR FINANCE AND CASH ORDERS WILL HAVE A DOUBLE SOURCE OF
INCOME AND PROFIT ?

This advertisement was prepared and in-
serted by British-Australian Underwriters
(Amal.), Limited, Adyar House, Bligh
Street, Sydney.
The Business Proposed by the Company
To establish a cash-order business for the sale of Furniture,
Player Pianos, Gramophones, Fanning Machinery, Tractors, Oil
Engines, Launches, Wireless Apparatus, Footwear, Clothing.
Drapery, Jewellery, Millinery, Mercery, Stoves, Baths, Washing
Machines, etc.
Intending purchasers of motor-cars will also receive the benefits
of the cash-order system never before offered in this country. The
Company will make a special feature of this. The repute and
financial stability of the buyer being assured, a cash order for the
cost of the car will be issued, which he will use as a cheque in
payment to any motor firm on the Company’s list. The usual agree-
ments will be entered into and the risk fully insured.
The Possibilities.
The Daily Guardian, 12th October, 1926, states that in 1923
there were 70,000 motor vehicles registered, and that, given the
rate of progress in the second half of this year as equal that of
the fh'st, there will be over 150,000 registered by the end of this
year. Further, should the present increases be sustained, there
will be registered over 200,000 cars by the end of 1930. This
means, on a conservative estimate, that over £55,000,000 will be
spent in the ensuing four years in purchases alone.
So far as cash orders are concerned, the Sydney Morning
Herald of 13th November, 1926, states: “In Australia, the cash-
order system extends to the purchase of Millinery, Clothing, General
Drapery, Mercery, Stoves, Baths. Electrical Goods). Wireless Apparatus,
Boots and Shoes, Optical Goods, Jewellery, Music, Gramophones,
Saddlery and Harness, even to attendance bv dentists.” More and
more people are purchasing their wants on the amazingly convenient
cash-order system. On 10th August, 1926, the Sydney Morning
Herald stated: “Judging by the known results of the working of
similar companies, a satisfactory return should be assured.”
The Profits.
In motor finance companies, one company has paid dividends
ranging from 22 per cent, to 55 per cent, on its capital. Another
company paid a dividend of 9 per cent, on its first six months’
trading, while another paid a dividend of 20 per cent. Another
company, registered only last year, paid a 21 per cent, dividend,
while another, established in 1923, disclosed a net profit of just
over 70 per cent. A motor finance company, registered only this
year, has already increased its capital from £187,000 to £250,000
to enable it to cope with its rapidly expanding business.
The profits of cash-order companies are also very high. There
are only two large companies operating, the others being small,
with insufficient capital. One company, established in 1907 with a
capital of £50,000, increased this to £270,000 by distributions
from reserves, and has always paid dividends of from 10 per cent,
to 15 per cent, per annum. Another company commenced business
in 1920 with a nominal capital of £50,000, and now has a paid-up
capital of £lOO,OOO and reserves of over £40,000. In 1922 this
company issued £13,000 in free bonus shares. In 1924 it paid a
dividend of 15 per cent, and 15 per cent, in bonus shares, and
last year it .paid dividends and bonus equal to 371 per cent,
The cash-order company receives 5 per cent, from the pur-
chaser of the goods as well as. a commission from the firm supplying
the goods, so that it gets a profit both ends of the transaction 1
Let us assume that the amount of the cash-order be paid in cash
on the date of the issue, the interest received from the customer on
a basis of 5 per cent, shows the cash-order company a return of
24.76 per cent, per annum on the capital employed. If we add
to this the commission received by the cash-order company from
the trader, taken at the very low average of 71 per cent., we get a
further return of 37.14 per cent, per annum, which gives the cash
order company a return equal to 61.90 per cent per annum on the
actual capital employed. If the cash-order company pays the trader
w'i'thin two weeks after the order is issued, it will be seen that
on the interest rate of 5 per cent, from the customer and 71 per
cent, from the trader, the return to the cash-order company on
the capital engaged is not less than 80 per cent, per annum. Most
of the shareholders in the large cash-order companies have quad-
rupled their first holdings from accumulated profits distributed in
the form of bonus shares, and dividends have ranged from 10 per.
cent, to 40 per cent, in those companies.
FINALLY. WHEN YOU AOO THE POTENTIAL PROFITS OF
THE. CASH-ORDER SYSTEM TO THE POTENTIAL PROFITS OF
MOTOR FINANCE. YOU HAVE A COMBINATION OF PROFIT-
. EARNING POWER QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO EQUAL IN AUS-
i'FRAUAN, FINANCE.
Extract from “The Review,”
an Australian journal of
Banking, Insurance & finance:
To the Secretary, Motor & Cash Orders, Limited, Sydney,
loth November, 1926.
Compliance with your recent request for an impartial
criticism of Motor and Cash Orders, Limited, affords me
much pleasure, for the attractiveness of your project and
the excellence of your Board remove all difficulties.
NAME AND SCOPE.
“Motor & Cash Orders, Limited,” is a good name, for it
suggests an all-embracing scope. Not only your Share-
holders, but the friends of your Shareholders and even the
general public will soon learn that by putting their buying
through your company —whether able to pay cash down or
needing credit —they will get absolutely reliable service.
The fact that you will be free to recommend all goods on
their merits and their suitability for the special needs
of your clients must give you a decided advantage. By
your Country Shareholders, who want nothing so badly as
absolutely reliable and independent agents in the Great
City, you will be even more highly appreciated for your ser-
vice than for your dividends, splendid though these are
sure to be. I take it for granted that your Cash Order
Department will, even from the first, be ever ready to send
Shareholders goods on the security of their paid-in capital,
if necessary—a service that will not only be profitable to you
but will make the capital of your Shareholders more
valuable to them as a standby than an equal sum in a
Savings Bank, for, besides being , more readily available, it
will be earning dividends all the time at a higher rate than
you will be charging for temporary advances of goods on
its security. It was, indeed, a happy thought that suggested
the incorporation of the Cash Order Department, for it
will be a simple matter for that Department to help sub-
scribers with their Capital payments. A few weeks should
see the whole of your Capital subscribed.
I have no hesitation in saying that there is sufficient
business awaiting you for the profitable employment of
ten times the Capital you are seeking. You will, however,
be able to increase your Capital very rapidly by paying your
high dividends partly in Bonus Shares, which is the best
possible way of increasing Capital, for it saves all brokerage.
You need have no fear of lack of scope. In fact, from
inquiries I have recently made in a special direction, which
1 will mention to you in a strictly private letter, I feel
sure that I can myself secure you, from most reliable
sources, highly profitable and perfectly safe business—in
your Cash Order Department—to the extent of at least
half-a-million sterling per annum.
DIVIDEND POSSIBILITIES.
With such a body of Shareholders as the brilliant pros-
pects of your enterprise will make it quite easy for you
to get, your Bankers should multiply your money by theirs
to the extent of at least five times, which would easily
result in 60 per cent, per annum in your Motor and General
Finance Department. Yet splendid as this undoubtedly is,
I think still more highly! of your Cash Order Department,
PREFERENCE SHARES.
The Preference Shares of Motor Cash Orders, Limited, are
as certain of earning 10 per Cent, per annum as it is
possible to imagine anything human being certain at all.
To provide the full dividend of 10 per cent, for the Prefer-
ence Shareholders, the total capital needs to earn but 1 per
cent, per annum, and it is confidently expected to earn 50
per cent, per annum or even more. I know of an instance
of a Motor Finance Company paying 280 per cent, per
annum for some time. Another company is still paying
70 per cent, per annum and this is without the splendid
assistance of a Cash Order Department. It has to be
remembered by intending Shareholders that the Preference
Shareholders can never get more than 1 per cent., which,
while interest rates maintain their present level, makes the
fully-paid Preference Share well worth £1 10s. As the
years roll on, however, reductions in interest rates are to
be expected, which means that there is a fair chance that
these Preference Shares will rise to a value of £2 per Share
or even more; but the dividend possibilities of the Ordinary
Shares are such that there would be nothing astonishing in
their rising to a value of £5 per Share, or even £lO per
Share. And their cost to-day is. £l.
It is to be noted, however, by intending investors that
only the first 100,000 Shares are absolutely offered at par,
for the Directors reserve the right to put a premium on any
or all of the others, with the exception of the 100,000 that
are being held for the option of the Brokers. The Brokers
announce, however, that “the holders of the first 10,000
Shares applied for and allotted will be offered the right
to take up at par (1) one Share for every Share held.”
There are, therefore, two excellent reasons why intending
investors should get into the Company in time to secure
Shares from the first 100,000. There is quite a good chance
that the early applicants will have the opportunity of getting
their money back tw 7 o or three times over by the mere sale
of their option rights.

tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
R.D.: To enslave, in the sense of im-
posing undesirable bondage. Both have the same
loot, but have developed widely dissimilar meanings.
. ...S.R.L.: “My Gentle Doe” earns no dough....
H.T.W.: Unsuitable... .T.W.D.: Pale moralising....
E.D.C.: What has Australia done to you that you
must go abroad for the scenes of your stories ?... .
Robin H.: It’s a remarkable effort, but it isn’t
poetry... .G.P.S.: Your “sloe-eyed girl” must have
considered you a slow-paced youth, seeing that you
wrote 24 verses before you kissed her. .. .Peter M.:
What it all means is still a dark secret... .5.0. L.:
Your “drinking song” is a nice cup of tea with the
tea well watered... .D.M.P.: You “rose up to behold
the dawn,” and then the night came rushing in.
Lots of days are like that P.L.: This is the only
place where we can park it:—
Jack and Jill went up the Hill,
Their Ford refused to function,
They walked a lot before they got
A tram to Bondi Junction.
....Cam D.: If verse was only froth and bubble
yours would stand alone. ... Delia M.: “With purple
tears he panoplies the vale” is twin-brother to
“With magenta sighs he upholsters the comet’s tail.”
Both are mere words.... Bluebush: Correct enough
in form and some of the expression is good; but
there are many trite passages. Fear you will not
get a publisher... .M.L.F.: Too slight... .Enid Hi:
Each has attraction, but not quite enough... *
Alfred O.: We suspect your literary hero, who takes
“copious notes” of everything, including his own
love affairs, to be a dashed dull writer.... Pat: An
old, crude and vulgar joke.... Gil Mac: The picture
of “The Deserted Father” is heart-wrenching:—
Distractedly the father poor
Attempts to soothe the babe that howls,
And get its bottle ; to cure Tom’s jaw,
And doctor little Jimmy’s bowels
So full of pain. He gets the tea
For all the children as he can.
His wife, base-hearted you’ll agree,
Has gone away with the baker’s man....
He scrubs their faces, combs their hair,
Attends to baby when he can;
But does his wife, hard-hearted, care?—
She’s gone away with the baker’s man !
... .G.L.W.: The best treatment for a tearful wife
is to dam her eyes. .. . Gon M.: You’re not a “slave
to literature” ; you’re a slave to verbosity. . . .A.L.A.:
From the lines, “The awful cry was heard afar, as
frenzied as a falling star,” we judge that you are
in the habit of hearing the stars scream.... Pan. D.:
Your “Hero” was shot at dawn—into the waste-bin.
. ...G.R.P.: Perhaps the lady will let you die at
her feet if you undertake to pay the funeral ex-
penses. .. .C.R.8.: Unreal picture. How many
writing-men in Australia do you know who own
valets ? Or would be bothered with them ?. .. .
J. : The ant is overworked... .P.M.0.: But
what is religion?. .. .Gar M.: “Humpty Dumpty” had
a great fall. .. .P.L.D.: You walk on stilts with
your head in the clouds; and dreadful things happen
to your feet... .G. 8.: Your “King Henry,” we
presume, is King Henry the Froth.... D.L.C.: The
covers of The Bulletin will not supply a red
garment for your “Shame”... .P.R.D.: If you want
a relief for your tears don’t use verse in future —-
try a handkerchief... .C.R.M.: “It was ever thus
in life.” To that “ever” we prefix an “n”....
Doris G.: The only reason why it all happens “in
the gloaming” seems to be that the gloaming is
popular—and real—in England. We get little of it
in Australia... .Bobs: You’ve got your figures wrong
somehow. The other man did eight times move
than you claim for your champion.... 180: Too
diffuse. Remember this paper’s beat is over a whole
continent, with a few islands thrown in. . . .Rob L.:
Well, this may touch her heart: —
I lost my mother and my dad
When I was but a little lad;
Brother or sister never had
To share with me my gruel;
And now you’ve left me all alone,
The only love I e’er didst own !
See how my tears are falling down;
Oh, don’t you think it’s cruel?
... .Ami: There’s something stately about “Farewell to
Thee! To Thou a Long Farewell!”....Gil Blase:
The smartest thing about it is the pen-name.... Gus
G.: Frankly, we prefer those who spill beers rather
than tears. .. .Lucifer: Previous publication—and our
preference for Australian yarns—sentences one. The
other is well told, but has not enough interest....
K. : The point of the different visions is good,
but the story doesn’t carry it... .R.C.: Don’t be so
didactic. .. .L.H.8.: Stories and “literary” (as dis-
tinguished from topical) verse on acceptance. Cut
out other matter on publication, and forward,
marked with date and page, to accountant, who will
remit payment.... H.R.T.: It’s fired with enthusi-
asm... .G.S.C.: Has a chance. Not all matter re-
ceived can be noticed in “Answers.” The verses pro-
bably went near acceptance. In that case it is often
thought advisable not to say anything lest it might
prejudice sale elsewhere... .B.B.: Cane-cutting pros-
pects a good idea crudely worked. Try to polish it.
... .John G.: Not bad ; try another shot. . . .Judy H.:
So near being very good they were read. three times
to try to fix their exact meaning. Be less nebulous.
. ...J.M.M.: Rough effort.... Kathleen K.: There’s
promise. Try again. .. .R.R.P.: The “Sonnet” isn’t a
sonnet. . . .Horace II.: “Fog-signal” is all fog. .. .A.S.:
Weird melodrama is too long. Curtailed and with the
improbabilities toned down it might do. .. .H.V.H.:
You waste good material which would be well used
if you weaved it on a good story-plot. .. .C.E.D.8.:
There is good color in it, but it is tangled and some-
times vague... .Charles D.: Returned after profound
meditation. The satire is overdone. .. .A.R.: Keep
on. You’ve got the material and some of the knack.
But the, drawing shows no promise.... Baomata:
“Account” is clumsy.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G.E.T.: Your work looks better in wash, but still

be able to put better lines on paper than that....
N.M.8.: Your art recalls the motorist who discovers
that he can’t stop his car and wonders where he will
finish... . J.A.: Joke dull and drawing flat... .P.U.P.:

3 years ahead of other Light Cars
JIM FTER three years of designing,
JL building, testing, and perfect-
ing, the Overland Whippet was finally
placed on the market. Millions im-
mediately recognized it as far advanced
in engineering and body-design. No
other car is like it—no other car can
nearly approach its amazing perform-
ance and beauty. Other light cars will
follow Whippet’s lead—but it will be
long before any one will be able to
attain the motor car perfection Whip-
pet now offers you.
New chassis features
Its center of gravity is extremely low,
with ample road clearance... thus giv-
ing a sense of security you have never
found in any light car . . . Something
you actually feel when you drive this car.
4-wheel brakes are an integral part of
this new car’s chassis design. No car
of this type has ever had 4-wheel
brakes before. The brakes are 11
inches in diameter, giving the amaz-
ing total of 192 square inches of brak-
ing surface.
Horn, spark and throttle are on the
steering wheel. The steering post is
adjustable to three positions.
Smart modern-type body design
This new car has a long, low body of
modern design, finished in durable
Duotone Duco with black beading
and gold stripe.
With top up it is only 5 feet 9 inches
high . . . not as tall as the average man
. . . yet it provides more room and
comfort than you’ve ever found in any
motor car of this class before.
High pozvered
It has a “high-torque” 31 horse-power
motor of small bore and long stroke—
the same engineer-
ing principle used
in the fastest racing
cars of Europe and
America. Its pow-
er will carry you
over steep hills,
or through deep
mud and sand
with ease.
No more sitting bolt up-
right-seats are placed in
a natural, restful position
The introduction of this new-type car
changes the whole motor car situation.
It establishes entirely new standards
of performance and value, by which
all light cars from now on must be
judged.
See this modern car. Ride in it. Drive
it. You will be amazed and thrilled at
its wonderful performance.

“Anti-Humbug”: “Huffin Guffin” com-
ments (B. 23/12/’26) on the weight of wheat
as ascertained at the point of delivery com-
pared with the weight delivered at oversea
countries by the ships carrying it, and asks
for the facts. Here they are. I have had
25 years’ expeidence as a wheat factor, and
I am prepared to produce .vouchers showing
the weight as ascertained at country receiv-
ing stations and by Government weighbridges
at Darling Island, whence shipment from
Sydney is made; also of the actual out-turn
at the discharge ports ascertained by those
supervising the weighing at those points.
These weighings make it abundantly clear
that the Darling Island (Sydney) weighings
over a season are generally less than the
country weight, on which the grower is paid.
Moreover, the weight ascertained at the dis-
charging points is less in the aggregate than
the Darling Island weighing.

“Detonator” : Twenty years ago my step-
dad, brothers and I, with the help of a few
abos. and half-castes, ran a fishery on Fraser
Island (Q.). We tackled shark, porpoise
and dugong, the oil of which we rendered
down at our plant on Stewart Island, and
sold to Brisbane chemists and Maryborough
sawmills, after disposing of some of the
meat locally. We also went in for dried
mullet, and for turtles and crabs, which we
sold in Maryborough as a side-line. We
ran a few hundred (more or less) angora
goats and several thousand chooks on
Stewart, Dream and Moonboom islands, pigs
on Bunny Island and cattle and horses on
Fraser, while we grew corn and vegetables
on Stewart. When we got tired of goat, pig
and dugong “beef” we got all the feathered
game and wallabies we wanted on the islands.
Our fleet consisted of a 32ft. cutter, an 18ft.
motor launch and two harpooning 18-footer
dinghies. On an odoriferous occasion, but
without malice aforethought, we even har-
pooned a disabled whale. We looked up
“whales” in the Encyclopaedia and decided
our fortune was a cert. As the cetacean had
gone west on a sand bank four miles from
the northern end of Stewart Island we dis-
mantled our boiling-down plant, rowed it
three miles and re-erected it; we made four
trips a day, with a dinghy full of blubber to
the gunwale (cut in square slices with toma-
hawks and skinning knives), escorted by
hungry sharks and seafowl the whole four
miles. On the fourth day, nearing Christ-
mas, the nigs, struck, alleging that this
was no white-pfella job; and I heartily
agreed (in petto). Altogether we made £3O
gross on the oil, but couldn’t dispose of the
whalebone, nor for many weeks of the odor,
which clung to everything. And, to add
insult to injury, the Boonooroo Council ad-
vised us in vigorous Lang-like terms that a
whale, believed to be our property had
stranded on the main beach and would we

remove it? We liad, at any rate, settled the
cost-of-living problem, and would be beach-
combing still in the Wide Bay had not the
loneliness palled on our womenfolk.

“Centurion” : The British Disposals Com-
mission will wind up next March. A hun-
dred years ago an army lived largely on the
country it fought in, and when a campaign
was over the victors went home with as
much of the property of the vanquished as
they could carry. It has taken Britain
eight years after the Great War to pick up
and dispose of her own gear, from Iraq to
Antwerp, and she has got back 700 millions
in cash by selling the goods. These range
from thousands of boats and barges on
French and Belgian rivers to pyramids of
wire netting in Iraq and Egypt.
* * * *
“Tops” : Much has been heard of the Aus-
tralian merino, but, save among experts or
those connected with the trade, there is
little mention of this country’s own sheep—
the Corriedale. The breed, originally a
blend of merino and coarse-wool types, was
evolved over 60 years ago, and expert selec-
tion and unwinking supervision have thor-
oughly established a sheep which combines
most of the virtues of both strains and
breeds thoroughly true to its type. Austra-
lian buyers once took a lot of convincing
that the new brand would not revert to its
original strains with inbreeding, but no-
thing of the kind has happened. Maori-
landers, always keen on utility sorts, took
to the Australian article from the first, and
it is now held in high esteem across the
Tasman. Indeed, the Dominion has now a
reputation as a breeder of the type, and is
shipping it to foreign markets. A few days
ago a consignment of 70 Corriedales, stud
rams and ewes, left Lyttelton for the Argen-
tine. There are few keener breeders of high-
class sheep and cattle than the Argentine
meat and wool interests, whose agents scour
the world for high-class stud stock, and the
Lyttelton shipment should finally set the
seal of expert approval on Australia’s own
home-brewed jumbuck.

CRAIG AND AITKEN
654 GEOROE ST SYDNEY
The par (B. 18/11/26) ne Cres-
wiek (Vic.) public and official notabilities
recalls that the town was the birthplace of
the artist Lindsays—Percy, Lionel, Norman,
Daryl and Ruby. They are of a family of
10, with each alternate one, commencing with
the eldest, an artist of high repute. The
others have no bent that way whatever.
The old Scottish motto “They say. What
say they? Let them say!” expressed very
precisely the attitude of S’Rupert Clarke
towards “society.” The naming of one of his
racehorses with a well-known stage star’s
initials was a deliberate flouting of conven-
tion of a sort in which he revelled. There
was never any secret about the fact that
S’Rupert’s money gave the lady the oppor-
tunities her ambition demanded.
Cyclist Bob Spears is looking up his
native land after an absence of 13 years,
and his native heath, Dubbo. showed what
it thought of the man who has mopped up
many a world’s championship by giving him
a civic reception. It was in his own town
that Bob started to ride when a kid of 15,
and one of the aldermen, J. White, who par-
ticipated in the welcome home, was the man
who handicapped the race. Spears, besides
having won the Grand Prix de France three
years in succession, beat Frank Kramer, one
of the few Americans who continue to push
a bicycle along, in seven out of nine meetings.
“Sturt”: One of the strangest of all
possible fatalities was that which came to a
boy of 11 at Port Adelaide a few days
ago. He had wandered into a motor shop
where he had no business, and was sitting
on a tyre to watch it being blown up, when
it exploded and killed him. The weight
of tyre was 2001 b., the air pressure 981 b; and
one onlooker said the boy was blown 14 feet
into the air.
When old Pat Ryan decided that 97 years
was a long enough innings and died at
Regent’s Park (Sydney) on New Year’s eve
the owner of some quaint memories of the
days when Sydney was a village passed
away. Ryan, an Oxberry native, born at
Windsor, camped in the bush at Stanmore
as a young man, making his living by cut-
ting down trees for the firewood carts which
hawked fuel in Sydney. Later he worked
the forest at Annandale, and later still at
Randwick. Afterwards he made comfortable
provision for his old age as a farmer in the
Armidale district.
Somewhere in Victoria a benevolent heart
beats under the flannel shirt of a rabbiter.
Its latest evidence was the receipt by the
policewomen of Melbourne of 500 rabbits
during Christmas-time, for distribution
amongst the poor of the city. They have
received similar gifts before without any
indication of the name or address of the
donor. So have some of the hospitals, and
when the Trades Hall was issuing strike
relief during the shipping hold-up large
parcels of bunny arrived as mysteriously.
Sons of Maoriland High Commissioners
take to either politics or literature. Tammas
Mackenzie’s son took to both. Jimmy Allen’s
son, who has just followed his father back
to the land of ferns and footballers, won’t
have to take to politics if his luck continues.
He has had three novels —“The Ship Beauti-
ful,” “Brown Smock” and “Tarry, Knights!”
—accepted and has had several playlets per-
formed. Charlie Allen combines the esoteric
with the philosophic in his fiction, and the
blend seems to be saleable.
“Sixenate”: George Davidson, whose 60
years’ pursuit of Costs was mentioned in
The Bulletin last week, is a relic of the
time when all things in the Ma State were
not centred in Sydney. Except as a rare
visitor, Davidson lias had nothing to do with
the Harbor City. Born at West Maitland,
he schooled there with Sam Griffith, after-
wards High Court Chief Justice, and then
served articles with a solicitor named Cham-
bers in his home town. Directly he qualified
his plate went up in Mudgee, and there he
has put in his full 60 years of Costs-collect-
ing. He pursued other thiners, too. The
Western Post, when it was published in
Mudgee, was his property, and he also ownel
a couple of sheep stations.
“lan C.”: It is, astonishing that Frank
Clarke, President of the Vic. Uppah
Chambah and chairman of the Parliamen-
tary Library Committee, had the nerve to sign
a notification calling for applications from
Avomen University graduates for two jobs
as Parliamentary Library assistants at the
commencing salary of £3 a week. What
makes the thing worse is that it is set
forth that a knowledge of a standard library
system will be appreciated. No decent firm
would dream of offering a graduate, and par-
ticularly a specialist graduate, such a screw.
Surely it is not intended to create mere
pocket-money positions for bored and well-
to-do women !
“C. Coral”: A Torres Strait native out
pearl-diving the other day brought up a
shell which yielded a dozen pearls. Another
boy, from Yam Island, got five (one a very
decent specimen) out of one shell. If this
kind of thing goes on, pearl necklaces will
be two a penny.
“Bris”: Which is the vain sex? The
manageress of a Brisbane beauty parlor
tells me that men form a considerable part
of her clientele. Two of her customers that
day were a traffic cop and the liall-porter
of a fashionable hotel; each had a permanent
wave.
“Derwentside”: At long last the West
Coast of Tasmania is to be linked up by
road with the rest of the State. The project
was first mooted in the forties of last cen-
tury, but there was no money available.
Thirty years ago jt entered on a new phase
with the proposed Great Western Railway,
which caused only bitterness between North
and South, and ended in a broken bubble and a
£lO,OOO deposit-forfeiture to the Government.
Ten years ago Henry Jones revived the idea,
asking for land concessions, but the Earle
Government turned it down. The road will
cost about £148,000 and go from Ouse
to Gormanston and on to Queenstown from
the Dee River (via Lake St. Clair), thus
connecting the West with the capital and
Launceston via Great Lake. Apart from
general benefits, there are big possibilities
of mineral development, according to old
prospectors.

The words “best” and “greatest”
have been used so often in the
motor car field that they have
ceased to be convincing.
In this verbal competition
Dodge Brothers have never
participated. They have
never referred to their car in
exaggerated terms. They
have simply permitted it to
be its own best salesman.
Costly steel, high-grade work-
manship, careful inspection,
quality equipment throughout
and reasonable prices these
are the principal factors that
have enabled Dodge Brothers
Motor Car to gain a marked
increase in sales through each
year of its existence.

The Dreamers.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
- «'TTT‘E talked about old steamers
V V Last night, my friend and I,
Just as two brave boy dreamers
Talked in the days gone by
When from the headlands olden
We watched the big ships go;
The future was all golden,
The years were all aglow.
We planned to go a-roaming
When we to men had grown——
To cross the bar a-foaming
And call the world our own.
And it was always steamers
That took our dreams to sea,
Down wakes like lacy streamers
Flung over waters free.
We laughed last night in thinking
What ships they were; to-day
They would not be worth sinking
Or towing down the bay.
Their days of glory ended,
They’ve passed as all things pass.
But they were liners splendid
To two boys. on the grass.
The Burwah bound for Brisbane,
The Fitzroy steering south,
The Jubilee for Gisborne,
Quirang for Yarra mouth;
And through the night mists drifting,
The old Eurimbla sang
Loud songs, her engines lifting
To race the Elamang.
With chins on hands we’d measure
The many steamers’ speeds—
The Catterthun with treasure,
The Changsha green with weeds.
The Mararoa giving
The Warrimoo a run,
The Wakatipu still driving,
A week from Wellington.
The stately Mariposa,
The Alameda’s twin,
The rolling Chimborazo,
The China steaming in.
The Peregrine, hard driven,
Led the Wodonga well;
Each gave what she was given
From stokeholds hot as hell.
We dreamed we’d sail as pursers,
Or maybe engineers,
In dreams that were precursors
Of driftings through long years.
The lands we planned to roam to
We saw; and, more and more,
The best dreams led us home to
The old, bluff Sydney shore.
We yarned about hard steaming
Last night, my friend and I,
But this time we were dreaming
About the days gone by.
Passed are the ships that filled them,
And as we talked we knew
That soon no hand will build them,
With steam to drive the screw.
But whether there be motors
Or wings instead of flames,
And though they call ships “floaters”
Or other fancy names,
When from the headlands olden
Boys watch the big ships go,
The future will be golden,
The years will always glow.

WILL LAWSON.
The Automatic Fowl.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rnHAT place over there? Well, sonny,
you ain’t been long ’round Mumble-
bog if y’ don’t know what that place
is. One of the sights o’ the town, it is.
That there old hut was once the home of the
great inventor, Mr. Hallows. Ratty Hal-
lows, so-called—the first, last an’ only disr
coverer of the automatic egg-layin’ machine.
This here Ratty Hallows was a skinny,
sallow-faced bloke, with a scraggy black
beard. He was a poultry-farmer down Syd-
ney way. Workin’ among fowls, night an’
day, he got to hate ’em. Called ’em messy,
cacklin’ nuisances, an’ said that it was past
any man’s doin’ to persuade the blame things
to give a reg’lar supply of eggs.
Anyway, he got a great idea. He was
a-goin’ to invent a machine that would make
fowls out of date. He sold up his farm and
came up the bush to carry out his inventin’
in peace an’ quiet. It was about the middle
of 1891 when he arrived here. I recollect
the date, because there was wild doin’s in
old Mumblebog that year, just about the
time Ratty got his machine in good workin’
order, turnin’ out the most snifter-lookin’
eggs y % ever clapped eyes on.
That’s thirty-five year ago. I was a young
feller then, ’bout twenty-five, an’ a prime
favorite I was with the girls, too. I was
out of a job at the time, an’ Ratty engaged
me fer to help with the inventin’ —kind of
handy man —at fifteen bob a week an’ tucker,
reg’lar wages fer a hand in them days.
He was single like meself, an’ me an’ him
batched it over in that there old hut. He
reckoned he’d be able to get his first sup-
plies on the market in nice time to catch
the heavy Christmas trade, an’ we worked
like horses, tryin’ t’ get the contraption
finished. Ratty wouldn’t let me see too
much of what he was doin’. He was mortal
afraid someone was a-goin’ to pinch his idea
before he got it properly worked out. He
even burned his plans as he went on, sayin’
that he could copy other machines from this
one.
He was pinnin’ his faith on a cuttin’ from
a magazine—the thing that first started him
thinkin’ about playin’ this dirty trick on the
fowls. It was all about eggs, showin’ how
the blamed things xvas made up, so much
of this an’ so mrndi of so and so. He
reckoned he could Guy all them ingredients
in quantities, feed ’’em into the machine, an’
turn out eggs by tin 3 million, flavored to suit
any taste, which wj is certainly somethin’ he
had on the old-fash .ioned hen.
Well, the great and ay arrived when we was
to start manufacturin’. Ratty had spent
his last few quid on a big parcel of powders
an’ bottled stuff from Sydney.
He stood by the hopper of the Fowl, with
all his little pots close by, each one boldin’
the amount of stuff he’d weighed out, like
the cuttin’ said was right. His eyes was
shinin’, an’ lie was breathing sharp and
gaspy, like a horse after a hard pull.
“Now, Joe,” he says to me, “when I start
to pour in these things you turn as hard as
y’ like. I’ll show the world what Tommy
Hallows can do. I reckon my machine’ll
beat all their pedigreed hens holler.”
As he poured the stuff in I bent my back
to it, like windin’ water out of a well, only
quicker.
“Keep her goin’ fer five minutes. That
ought t’ fix ’em,” he yells, jumpin’ up an’
down like a loony, listenin’ to the beaters
an’ wheels grindin’ away inside the Fowl’s
stummick.
“That’ll do,” he says at last. “I’ll turn
the shell belt. You pick ’em off an’ pack
’em.”
This here shell belt was a’ ingenious contri-
vance, I can tell y’. The lime for the shells
went into a mould, heated by a lamp, an’
the shell came out white an’ smooth, with a
little hole fer the meat of the egg to run
through. As they came from the mould
the shell belt picked ’em up, an’ took ’em
past the two fillin’ jets, one fer the yolk
an’ the other fer the white. It was a great
machine, an’ Ratty had it all reckoned out
to the thickness of a hair, even to the thing-
ummy that sealed the egg after it was filled.
He turned the crank an’ I picked the
eggs off. He was all eyes, watchin’ me
packin’ ’em into the cases he’d got to send
'em to market in.
“We’ll stop ’er at a thousand,” lie says.
“That’ll do fer our first batch.”
It took no time to run that thousand
through, either—’bout an hour, I s’pose. It
was pretty plain then that Ratty was a-goin’
to be a millionaire; But all the poor devil’s
troubles were to come.
It was near dinner when we finished. He
says we’ll try a few of the eggs, so we ran
another dozen through an’ he took ’em into
the hut to fry.
He came out in a minute hangin’ on to his
nose with both hands.
“They’re all bad,” he calls out, kind of
muffled an’ sick.
I picked up one of the eggs an’ cracked it
on a stone. Bad! I’ll bet them eggs were
the rottenest ever made since the world
was a pup.
“Somethin’s gone wrong, Mr. Hallows,”
I says, comfortin’ as I could. “You’ll get
it next time.”
He brightened up a bit, an’ then his face
fell.
“I’m stony broke,” he says dolefully.
“I won’t be able to buy any more chemicals
till I go to work an’ earn the money.”
“What’ll I do with these eggs?” I says.
“Leave ’em to me,” he replies sadly. “I’ll
take ’em over to the reserve an’ dump ’em.”
We had dinner off corned-beef an’ dodger,
down on the bank of the creek, well away
from those stink-bombs we’d made. Ratty
went over the article from the magazine an’
checked every item, but lie couldn’t see where
the mistake came in that turned all them
snifter-lookin’ eggs rotten.
"It must be the mixin’,” he says at length.
“I didn’t think that would make much differ-
ence, or I wouldn’t have made up such a
lot for a start.”
After dinner we harnessed old Roger into
the spring cart an’ loaded the cases of eggs
on board. Ratty drove off very steady, with
a handkerchief ready to use on his nose in
case of breakages.
What happened after that I heard when he
came back to the hut. As lie was drivin’
a few of the so-called eggs broke, an’ as
the cart went along it spread an effluvium
like this here Paddy McGinty’s goat they
sing about.
Next day was election day, an’ the boys
were beginnin’ to flock into Mumblebog to
hear the last speeches an’ get a skinful of
free beer at the candidates’ expense.
Feelin’ ran pretty high in town that
election, too. A local squatter, named Mc-
Guffey, was standin’ as a Liberal candidate.
He wasn’t very popular in some quarters,
’specially among the shearers at his shed.
He had worked some dodge on ’em, an’ had
managed to hold enough of their money to
get; them swearin’ to be even at any price.
As Ratty drove to the reserve he passed
the drag that had gone to bring the shearers
and rouseabouts into Mumblebog. They
caught sight of the boxes of eggs an’ got the
full force of their smell at the same moment.
The drag driver lashed up his horses, but
Ted Robinson, the shed rep. an’ a brainy
young feller, called on him to stop.
“Just the thing we want for McGuffey’s
meetin’ to-night, boys,” he yelled.
The men caught the idea an’ swarmed to
the cart. Ratty was too surprised to say
anything when they grabbed a couple of the
cases and hoisted them into the drag. Robin-
son explained what they wanted ’em for, an’
took the hat ’round, handin’ over the col-
lection, about two quid, before he left.
That made him think. He went on to j
the reserve, dumped half his load, an’ drove
into Mumblebog with the rest. He went
straight to a publican named McDermott, a
strong supporter of McGuffey’s, an’ told
him a terrible tale about what the shearers
were a-goin’ to do. The publican bit like a
cod, an’ for another couple of notes bought
the two cases Ratty had saved, reckonin’
he’d arm the McGuffey supporters with ’em
an’ break up the opposition. That was
the way we ran elections them days.
It was a warm afternoon, an’ the voters
gathered at the rival pubs, sinkin’ beer as
fast as the bar-crews could hand it out.
Both sides were grinnin’ up their sleeves,
thinkin’ what a surprise they had waitin’
fer the other.
After supper the fun started. McGuffey
got on a table in the middle of Main-street
an’ began to spout. Thomas, the other can-
didate, opened up a hundred yards farther
along. For a while all was quiet, then the
shearers began to drift towards the squatter’s
stand.
He was in the midst of a great bit ’bout
how the country was a-goin’ to the dogs
because the shearers left half the wool on

A Handy Box Costs
Only 1/6
the sheep, when Ted Robinson gave the
signal. Hands flew up in all directions, an’
those ripe eggs hit McGuffey wherever he
could be hit. He gave a screech an’ jumped
from the table, tearin’ his coat off an’ offerin’
to fight any two shearers in the country.
His friends hadn’t started on Thomas yet,
an’ when they heard the racket they came
runnin’ to help McGuffey. The shearers
opened up on ’em with the eggs. They
retaliated, o’ course, until supplies ran out
on both sides, by which time Mumblebog
was in a ’orrible state. Then they came to
blows, fightin’ like tigers up an’ down Main-
street for over an hour, after which they
cooled off, had a few more drinks, an’ went
home to bed.
’Bout nine o’clock next mornin’ we were
workin’ on the Fowl when I sees a big cloud
of dust cornin’ from town. I gave Ratty
a call, an’ he watches it fer a while. As
it comes closer we see it is raised by ’bout
a dozen buggies and sulkies, all packed with
women who are brandishin’ umbrellas an’
sticks an’ urgin’ their horses like mad.
Ratty gave ’em one long look, then he
turns a shade paler. He was no fool, in
spite of his name, an’ lie tumbled that they
were after him.
“Mixin’ in politics don’t pay,” he says.
“I’ll write you where to send the Fowl.”
He ran to the shed where he kept the old
cart-horse stabled, threw a bridle on him,
an’ was off like a shot. The women see
him leavin’ and gave a combined screech o’
rage that fair made my blood run cold. I
reckoned they had nothin’ agin me an’
stood my ground, waitin’ to see what all the
trouble was.
“Is that Ratty Hallows on that horse?”
one of ’em yells.
I nodded, an’ the first few buggies set
out after him, with women in ’em I’d known
as quiet little country gels standin’ up an’
yellin’ like blood-smellin’ dingoes.
The rest of ’em gathered round me.
“What’re you doin’ here, Joe Blake?” one
of ’em asks.
“I been workin’ fer Mr. Hallows,” I says.
She gave the others a meanin’ look. “You
helped him make this egg-machine, I s’pose?”
I said I did.
“Is this it?” she says, pointin’ to the Fowl.
I nodded an’ started to tell her how it
worked.
“Never mind,” she snaps. “It won’t work
much longer. Grab him, girls. We’ll teach
him to make a mess of our town.”
I said it wasn’t nothin’ to do with me,
but they grabbed me, frog-marched me to the
creek an’ picked out the dirtiest an’
weediest hole they could find. I looked round
and yelled fer help, but there was no one in
sight; nothin’ ’cept a cloud o’ red dust
rollin’ towards the horizon —Ratty an’ the
wild women still goin’ strong. That’s all
I got a chance to see before they picked me
up by the seat of the pants and slung me in.
Fer half an hour they amused themselves
peltin’ me with sticks an’ stones ev’ry time
T shoved my head above the stinkin’ water.
Then all of a sudden one of them thinks of
the machine, an’ they made a break fer the
hut.
I crawled on to the bank in time to see
’em start on the bran’-noo Fowl with an
axe, each takin’ a turn till they had it
squashed flat as a pancake.
They never caught Ratty. The two buggy-
loads that had chased him came in ’bout
sundown wilder than ever an’ started to
look fer me, thinkin’ they’d make up fer
the fun the others had had. Some of ’em
wanted t’ tar-an’-featlier me an’ ride me out
o’ town on a rail, jus’ fer interferin’ with
nature in the matter o’ eggs.
I lfiid low fer a week, an’ by that time
everything was settled down ag’in, although
fer months after, till the next rain came,
the buildings of Mumblebog were a-covered
with big yeller splotches that made strangers
ask all sorts o’ foolish questions.
N. S. MORRELL.
Kaikai.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FENTON swung his feet out of the
camp stretcher, meditatively finger-
ing the week-old stubble on his chin.
Tucked under liis tongue was a clinical ther-
mometer. Presently he removed the instru-
ment and held it up to the light.
“Ninety-eight point four,” he muttered
with great satisfaction. It had been a pretty
severe bout, he reflected; one of the worst
attacks of malaria he had experienced in
years. No wonder he felt all in! To-
morrow he would lodge an application for
leave. Leave! Sydney! The mere thought
raised visions of Fright lights and brighter
eyes, the swish of silken garments and the
gleam of snow-white shoulders; the provo-
cative tinkle of ice in thin glasses; the reek
of petrol in city streets; the sheen of wet
paveifients—all the odd fancies which tor-
ment sick white men in solitary places.
He lay back on the stretcher, dizzy from
weakness. What fools men were to bury
themselves in New Guinea, sacrificing youth
and precious health for a reward a Sydney
wharf-lumper would sneer at! New Guinea !
Cruel, pitiless New Guinea! Ruthlessly
striking down the weak, permitting only the
strong to survive.
Fenton half-turned, suddenly conscious of
a feeling of discomfort. Some hard object
entangled in the blankets was pressing in-
tolerably upon his spine. His groping hand
drew forth an automatic pistol. Fenton
shivered, and into his eyes there came an
expressio of startled wonder.
“Good God!” he muttered through lips
that seemed stiff. “What a—what a play-
thing for a man with the—with the ding-
oats !”
With shaking hands he snapped back the
breech, then tossed the weapon from Him.
laughing hysterically. The magazine was
empty. Somebody must have
“You sing out,. sah?” A hook-nosed,
fierce-eyed Kiwai in the uniform of a ser-
geant of police entered the room, stepping
softly. He picked up the pistol, took a clip
of cartridges from his pouch and deftly re-
loaded the weapon.
“I bin taken out cartris, sah,” he ex-
plained gravely. “No good yqu play about
’long small-fella gun when all time you head
he no-good.”
Fenton tottqred to his feet. He was very
quiet as Sergeant Gomari wrapped a blan-
ket about his shoulders and led him to a
battered cane lounge on the verandah.
“Sergeant,” said Fenton at last in Motuan,
“I count it—er—an honor that you are my
friend.”
The native’s impassive face expanded in
an embarrassed grin. “Unai namo, tau-
bada [That is good, sir],” he replied gruffly.
He straightened himself and saluted. “I go
now, sah?”
The white man nodded wearily.
“I go look out for fish ’long saltwater,
sah,” continued the sergeant. “One boy he
go bush look out pigeon. This time, sah,
you wantem plenty good-fella kaikai, I
t’ink so.”
Fenton relaxed in the lounge, and his hetirt
warmed towards Sergeant Gomari. But for
his brown-skinned offsider there might have
been yet another black-bordered paragraph
in the Gazette and a step up the ladder for
some junior patrol-officer. His people would
have been told that there had been an “acci-
dent” with a gun, and well-meaning office
desk-men at Port Moresby, knowing little
and caring less about the real New Guinea,
would make fatuous remarks about the evils
of solitary drinking!
From where he lay Fenton could see
Gomari at the water’s edge, fishing-spear in
hand. Save for a girdle of tapa cloth, the
man was quite naked. For a moment he
posed in the sunlight, a living statue in
polished bronze; then he waded into the sea
to an outcrop of rock showing above the
surface like the back of some monster of
the deep. Here he crouched upon his heels,
his keen eyes searching the depths, and lie
crooned softly a dirge-like chant.
On the hoi'izon, as if miraculously sus
pended between sea and sky, was a cluster
of tiny palin-crested islands. Fenton eyed
them longingly. To-morrow he would send
over the “whaler” in quest of Gomari’s pre-
scription of “plenty good-fella kaikai.” Over
there were pigeons, turtles, rock-oysters and
succulent “crays.” Turtle-eggs, even, were
not so bad when—• —-
“Taubada! What name you kaikai, tau-
bada?”
A small boy, wearing a spotless white loin-
cloth, stood by the sick man’s side. His eyes
were wide with curiosity, and in his arms he
carried a collection of flamboyantly-labelled
tins. Fenton shuddered.
“Go away, Cookie,” he croaked. “I
From somewhere in the bush arose the
loud, booming cry of a goura-pigeon, fol-
lowed instantly by the report of a shotgun.
The cook-boy beamed.
“I hope he has the sense to skin it before
he brings it in,” muttered Fenton, mindful
of the penalty that attends the destruction of
protected birds. Sergeant Gomari stood up,
signalling with his spear; then he crouched
upon his heels again.
“Missed!” announced the cook-boy. “No
pigeon, taubada. More better I makem sit-
too [stew].” He held up the tins for liis
master’s inspection. Roast beef, corned beef,
boiled beef, and sardines in—ugh—oil! The
white man’s face twisted into an expression
of disgust.
“Good God !” he muttered. “ ‘Sit-too’!”
It was growing darker. Already the
sapphire mirror of the sea was lightly
rippled by the faint breath of the land-
breeze. Soon the sun would drop below the
horizon like a ball of molten gold, for a few
brief moments the western sky would be a.
kaleidoscope of magic colors, and it would be
night.
Stew! A greasy concoction of stringy
“bullumacow,” soggy, soap-like sweet pota-
toes and —pah! A feeling of nausea grew in
Fenton’s stomach. He started to rise.
“Go away, boy,” he mumbled impotently.
“Go away!”
The sergeant’s mournful chant had ceased.
His attitude had grown tense, and his eyes
were riveted on the water at his feet. Slowly,
stealthily he stood up, balancing the spear in
his right hand. He drew back his right arm,
and Fenton thrilled as he glimpsed the
rippling play of muscle under the silky
bronze skin. For a moment Gomari stood
poised, splendid in his strength, then swiftly,
unerringly the spear descended. There came
a swirl of white water, followed by ‘ a yell
of triumph from the fisherman.
“Taubada,” the cook-boy’s voice was in-
gratiatingly insistent. “More better I mak-
em”—
Fenton laughed, cheerfully, exultantly.
“Stew be damned!” he announced in a firm
voice. “To-night I kaikai fish !”
TAUWARRA.
Execution.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The bloody dawn leapt wide,
The mob howled loud.
High-scaffolded, unbowed
The martyr died.
The sweaty butcher quaffed
His heavy ale ;
Playing children laughed.
The trunk bled pale.
The slaken riot sank
Back to its slums.
The guard marched off with drums.
The butcher drank.
An early violet
Woke in sweet shade;
In green lanes lovers met.
A woman prayed.
Greedy and carrion eyes
Where highroads cross,
Feathered in evil gloss.
Rent their grim prize.
A foolish woman wept.
In cellars dank
The sated riot slept.
The butcher drank.

■ ■ MOTOR MOWER
AT SPECIAL CUT PRICES FOR THE
1926 SEASON.
The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the neces-
sity of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, &c.
Jt is fitted with a 2|-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
noth to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one at-
tendant for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an “Atco,” thanks to the scientific precision of its con-
struction, is remarkably low. Ah operator can very easily and completely cut
1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol and
oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
With the object of making fchisALL-BRITISH MOWER more popular on
the Australian market, we are offering them for season 1926 at specially reduced
prices. Full stocks on hand,
